https://openalex.org/W1519712150,"A nonspecific NADPH-dependent carbonyl reductase from human brain (formerly designated as aldehyde reductase 1; Ris, M. M., and von Wartburg, J. P. (1973) Eur. J. Biochem. 37, 69-77) has been purified to homogeneity. The enzyme reduces a number of biologically and pharmacologically active carbonyl compounds. Quinones, e.g. menadione, ubiquinone, and tocopherolquinone are the best substrates, followed by aldehydes containing an activated carbonyl moiety, e.g. 4-nitrobenzaldehyde or methylglyoxal. The enzyme also reduces ketones, e.g. prostaglandins of the E and A class, the anthracycline antibiotic daunorubicin and 3-ketosteroids. During catalysis the pro 4S hydrogen atom of the nicotinamide ring of NADPH is transferred to the substrate. Flavonoids, e.g. quercetin and rutin, indomethacin, ethacrynic acid, and dicoumarol inhibit the enzyme activity. 4-Hydroxymercuribenzoate and iodoacetate inactivate the enzyme. NADPH and substrate do not protect against the loss of activity. Carbonyl reductase consists of a single polypeptide chain with a molecular weight of 30,000. The native enzyme occurs in three molecular forms with similar substrate specificity and inhibitor sensitivity. The isoelectric points of the three enzyme species are 6.95, 7.85, and 8.5. In the presence of coenzyme the isoelectric points are shifted to 5.2 to 5.9. The comparison of structural and enzymic features of carbonyl reductase with other monomeric oxidoreductases suggests a close relationship of carbonyl reductase with prostaglandin 9-keto-reductase and xenobiotic ketone reductase."

https://openalex.org/W2063721147,"A 230,000 dalton polypeptide co-purifies through cycles of depolymerization and polymerization with the intermediate filament subunits, desmin and vimentin, from avian smooth muscle. This protein is also present in skeletal muscle and is distinct from myosin and filamin. Double immunofluorescence microscopy of cultured cells, using antisera shown to be specific by immunoautoradiography, has revealed that this protein has the same spatial distribution as desmin and vimentin. During skeletal myogenesis, all three antigens exist initially in multinucleate myotubes as wavy filaments throughout the cytoplasm. Within a week after myoblast fusion, they begin to coalesce at the peripheries of the myofibril Z discs, thereby attaining the distribution observed in mature muscle, a network of interlinked rings within the Z plane. Treatment of cultured myotubes with colcemid causes the filamentous forms of these three proteins to co-aggregate into cytoplasmic bundles, but has little effect on them when they are associated with the Z discs. Extraction of cells with nonionic detergent and high salt leaves cytoskeletons containing desmin, vimentin and the 230,000 dalton polypeptide with immunofluorescent patterns that are indistinguishable from one another. These data suggest that this high molecular weight protein is closely associated with desmin and vimentin filaments in muscle cells; to indicate this, we have named the protein synemin, from the Greek δ υν (with) and νη μα (filament)."

Variation of the peptide portion of the reagents has provided affinity labels for the selective inactivation of the thiol endopeptidase cathepsin B, streptococcal proteinase, and clostripain and for the aminodipeptidase cathepsin C. Comparison of rates of inactivation of cathepsin B and streptococcal proteinase revealed a similarity in specificity, both enzymes showing a preference for a phenylalanine residue in the penultimate position of the peptide portion of the reagent. Reagents not satisfying the specificity of a particular thiol proteinase either did not inactivate or did so only very slowly. In some cases, the reagents bound to the enzyme in a manner unproductive for alkylation but productive for substrate behavior leading to destruction of the inhibitor by cleavage of the peptide portion. Thus, benzyloxycarbonyl-Phe-Gly-Phe diazomethyl ketone was rapidly cleaved by cathepsin B into benzyloxycarbonyl-Phe-Gly and phenylalanine diazomethyl ketone. Clostripain, an enzyme of trypsin-like specificity, was selectively inactivated by benzyloxycarbpnyl-Lys diazomethyl ketone at micromolar concentrations, but was inactivated extremely slowly by 2.5 x 10/sup -4/ M benzyloxycarbonyl-Phe-Ala diazomethyl ketone, a very effective inactivated by Gly-Phe diazomethyl ketone in the range of 10/sup -7/ to 10/sup -8/ M.more » By comparison, peptidyl diazomethyl ketones with blocked NH/sub 2/ terminals were considerably less effective. Peptidyl diazomethyl ketones are unreactive with such thiols as mercaptoethanol and glutathione.« less"

Isolation of N-ethylmaleimide peptides and two-dimensional peptide mapping demonstrated that 90% of bound N-ethylmaleimide was attached to an adjacent residue, cysteine 373, independent of the polymerization state of actin during the labeling reaction. Formation of NBD cysteine severely inhibited lysine modification. After N-ethylmaleimide blockage of cysteine 373, lysine labeling with NBD was greatly accelerated. The kinetics of formation of fluorescent compounds were biphasic, with fluorescence decreasing upon prolonged incubation of actin in NBD-Cl. Lysine 372 of purified NBD actin reproducibly responded to polymerization by a 2.2- to 2.3-fold enhancement of fluorescence. By contrast, interaction of NBD actin with several actin-binding proteins caused only very small or undetectable changes in fluorescence intensity: 10% enhancement on myosin subfragment 1 binding, about 6% quenching by DNase I, and no change at all by tropomyosin-troponin. Despite its sensitivity to polymerization the probe did not affect it. Native and modified actin polymerized randomly indicating that the rate constants for polymerization remained the same. Labeling actin with NBD did not diminish its cofactor activity for myosin ATPase activity. Contrary to previous reports we observed that myosin subfragment 1 (single myosin heads) caused actin polymerization in the absence of salt."

https://openalex.org/W1562032031,"The action of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) upon luteinizing hormone (LH) secretion is calcium-dependent, but is not mediated by cyclic AMP, cyclic GMP, or prostaglandins. The role of calcium-mediated phospholipid turnover in GnRH action was investigated in 2-day cultured pituitary cells, in which the production and target cell effects of arachidonic acid were analyzed in relation to GnRH-stimulated LH release. Addition of 10(-8) M GnRH, which stimulated LH release 5-fold, caused a 35% increase in the rate of [3H]arachidonic acid release from prelabeled phospholipids. The effects of GnRH on arachidonic acid and LH release, which occurred within 10 min, were calcium-dependent and were not accompanied by a change in [3H]prostaglandin formation. The phospholipase A2 inhibitors, chloroquine and quinacrine, prevented the effect of GnRH on arachidonic acid formation and LH release. Addition of exogenous arachidonic acid or phorbol myristate acetate (which increases endogenous arachidonic acid) caused a dose-related release of LH, whereas prostaglandin E2 had no effect. Although GnRH action was highly calcium-dependent, stimulation of LH release by arachidonic acid was unaltered in the absence of extracellular calcium. The effect of arachidonic acid on LH release did not depend on conversion to prostaglandins and was not additive with the action of a maximal stimulating concentration of GnRH. These results demonstrate that GnRH increases arachidonic acid formation from the phospholipids of pituitary gonadotrophs, and indicate that the fatty acid or its metabolites can initiate LH release."

https://openalex.org/W2039474732,"The two genetically unlinked histone H2B genes isolated from Saccharomyces cerevisiae have been sequenced. The genes encode H2B proteins that are 130 amino acids in length and that differ by 4 amino acids. The changes between them are Ala → Ser, Lys → Ala, Thr → Val and Ala → Val at amino acid positions 2, 3, 27 and 35, respectively. A comparison of yeast H2B histones with those of higher eucaryotes demonstrates a high degree of homology clustered mainly at the carboxyl terminus. There is extensive base substitution between the two H2B genes in nucleotides that do not affect the amino acid sequence. DNA prelude sequences show 64% divergence. The coding regions differ at 49 of the 390 bases (12.6% divergence). 41 of these changes are in silent positions. By using the number of amino acid differences in the proteins we estimate that the two H2B genes are the result of an ancient duplication event."

https://openalex.org/W1546098112,"Phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (EC 4.1.1.49) from Saccharomyces cerevisiae was purified to homogeneity. The enzyme is composed of four subunits of Mr = 64,000. Specific antibodies against phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase were raised in rabbits and purified by affinity chromatography. Phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase is rapidly inactivated when glucose is added to cells starved for carbon (Haarasilta, S., and Oura, E. (1975) Eur. J. Biochem. 52, 1-7; Gancedo, C., and Schwerzmann, K. (1976)( ARch. Microbiol. 109, 221-225). In the present study this inactivation has been analyzed by immunochemical techniques. It was found that the loss of catalytic activity is paralleled by a decrease in cross-reacting material which suggests degradation of the enzyme. In the absence of glucose the enzyme is degraded very slowly, which indicates that glucose-induced inactivation cannot simply be due to repression of enzyme synthesis in the presence of a rapid rate of degradation. Experiments with a proteinase-deficient mutant showed that proteinase B, carboxypeptidase Y, and carboxypeptidase S are not involved in the inactivation system."
https://openalex.org/W1580820940,"The location within the virion of the A, C, and D minor coat proteins of the filamentous bacteriophage fl has been analyzed. The A protein is present in approximately 5 copies/particle and is located at the tip of normal length phage, miniphage, and fl/pBR322 chimeric phage, a longer than normal length phage. The mole ratios of the A, C, and D proteins are the same for each type of particle, consistent with a model of phage organization in which the minor coat proteins are clustered near or at the ends of the phage. Normal length phage were fragmented by passing them through a French press, and those fragments that contained the A protein were separated from those that did not by treating the mixture with anti-A protein antibody. Analysis of the protein compositions of the two populations of fragments showed that the A and D proteins were found together in one population of fragments and that most, it not all, of the C protein was found in the other. These results show that the D protein is located near or at the A protein end of the phage and that the C protein is located in a region near or at the opposite end. Treatment of the virion with proteases which lowered the infectivity of the phage resulted in particles in which only the A protein was cleaved to any detectable extent. These particles remained resistant to the action of micrococcal nuclease."
https://openalex.org/W1541184580,"Two kinetically distinguishable sn-glycerol 3-phosphate (glycerol-P) acryltransferase activities were detected in Escherichia coli inner membranes using acyl-acyl carrier protein (ACP) substrates. The first system was characterized as having a Michaelis constant (Km) for glycerol-P of 90 microM and utilized palmitoyl-ACP to form primarily 1-acylglycerol-P. Palmitoyl-CoA and cis-vaccenoyl-ACP were also utilized by this system but, with these substrates, significantly more phosphatidic acid was formed as compared to palmitoyl-ACP. Although palmitoyl-ACP and palmitoyl-CoA had kinetically indistinguishable glycerol-P sites, distinct acyl donor binding sites were inferred from kinetic experiments using acyl carrier protein as an acyltransferase inhibitor. A second enzyme system, characterized as having a Km for glycerol-P of 700 microM, was found using palmitoyl-ACP as a substrate. This acyltransferase had a slightly higher pH optimum than the low Km acyltransferase activity, and phosphatidic acid was the major product. Two degradative reactions were identified in this system. One reaction yielded diacylglycerol when palmitoyl-ACP was the substrate. The other degradative reaction produced glycerol. Glycerol was formed in all incubations but was most pronounced when palmitoyl-ACP was the substrate."
https://openalex.org/W1558237727,"The flow of carbon in vivo from glucose to cellulose in developing cotton fibers which were actively engaged in the deposition of a cellulosic secondary cell wall was traced. Steady state levels of nucleotide sugars were analyzed from developing cotton fibers harvested between 13 and 36 days post-anthesis (DPA). The UDP-sugars were the predominant nucleotide sugars. UDP-glucose constituted over 75% of the UDP-sugar fraction, but UDP-galactose and traces of other UDP-sugars were also detected. The UDP-glucose levels increased from 0.2 ..mu..mol/boll at 13 DPA to over 2.1 ..mu..mol/boll by 24 DPA, just prior to the maximum rate of secondary wall cellulose synthesis; the levels dropped precipitously at the time when cellulose synthesis ceased. Fibers, cultured in vitro possess a very similar nucleotide-sugar composition to that of plant-grown fibers. When such fibers are pulse-labeled in vivo with (/sup 14/C)glucose, UDP-glucose is the predominant nucleotide sugar labeled. Pool size and rates of labeling of glucose, glucose-phosphate, and UDP-glucose pool data were analyzed using a computer simulation model, and it was determined that the rate of synthesis and turnover of UDP-glucose is more than sufficient to account for the combined rates of accumulation of sucrose, sterylglucosides, ..beta..-1,3-glucan, and cellulose. These data strongly indicate more » that UDP-glucose is a precursor to secondary wall cellulose in the cotton fiber. « less"
https://openalex.org/W1606194695,"The time-dependent inactivation of hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA reductase from yeast by solutions of hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA and CoASH is due to the rapid inactivation of the enzyme by oxidized CoA (CoA disulfide) present at trace levels in solutions of hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA and CoASH. Solutions of hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA or CoASH incubated for 1.5 h with 10 mM dithiothreitol at pH 7.0, 22 degrees C, do not inactivate the enzyme. Inactivation of hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA reductase is rapid and complete at concentrations of CoA disulfide comparable to those measured in solutions of hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA and CoASH. Inactivation of the enzyme by CoA disulfide may be reversed by treating the inactive enzyme with 10 mM dithiothreitol at pH 7.0 Both the inactivation of the enzyme by CoA disulfide and reactivation by dithiothreitol are inhibited by hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA. Other disulfides such as Ellman's reagent and glutathione disulfide also inactivate the enzyme. A thio-disulfide exchange reaction with a sulfhydryl group on the enzyme forming a mixed disulfide or an intramolecular protein disulfide could account for the enzyme inactivation. The normal function of the sulfhydryl group involved in the inactivation of the enzyme is unknown."
https://openalex.org/W1497195962,The investigation of the substrate specificity of the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex from Escherichia coli allows a description of the binding region of pyruvate. Substrate analogs with electronegative substitutions in the methyl group show a strong competitive inhibition of the overall reaction of the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex. The most efficient inhibitor is fluoropyruvate which has a more than 100-fold higher affinity for the enzyme than pyruvate (Ki = 1.4 x 10(-6) M) does. The affinity of alpha-keto acids decreases with increasing chain length. Branched chain alpha-keto acids are even less effective inhibitors (Ki = approximately 0.02 M). alpha-Ketobutyrate is the only alpha-keto acid which is able to substitute for pyruvate as a substrate in the overall reaction of the enzyme complex. The Km value (3 mM) is 10-fold greater than that for pyruvate. The steady state kinetics of the overall reaction of alpha-ketobutyrate exhibits the same cooperativity (nh = 1.9) as seen with pyruvate. Small modifications of the carbonyl or the carboxyl group of pyruvate prevent binding completely. Binding of pyruvate to the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex may thus require interaction with two independent electrophilic centers. The acceptance of the methyl group seems not so much due to lipophilic interactions as to a steric effect. The experiments were carried out with an enzyme which was purified by a modified procedure which is faster and more convenient than previous methods. The procedure is applicable up to 0.5 liter of crude extract.

https://openalex.org/W1568761144,"The structures of proteoglycans synthesized and secreted by Swarm rat chondrosarcoma chondrocytes cultured in the presence of insulin, multiplication-stimulating activity (MSA), and fetal calf serum were investigated. Proteoglycans produced in all cultures were found as link protein stabilized aggregates. Monomeric proteoglycans from cultures treated with MSA or insulin were slightly larger in hydrodynamic size than those synthesized by chondrocytes maintained in unsupplemented medium. This increase reflected a 25 to 30% increase in the length of the covalently bound chondroitin sulfate side chains. No free glycosaminoglycans were detected in any cultures, although the presence of a lower molecular weight proteoglycan at a significant concentration was observed in the medium fraction of serum-maintained cultures. MSA and insulin treatments did not result in the synthesis of a proteoglycan containing other types of glycosaminoglycans nor did they alter the degree or position of sulfation of the chondroitin sulfate glycosaminoglycans. The small changes in proteoglycan structure do not account for the larger differences in the levels of incorporation of radioactivity indicating that the primary effect of MSA and insulin on proteoglycan synthesis in this in vitro system is an increased rate of synthesis and secretion of proteoglycan."

The homocysteine produced from hydrolysis of AdoHcy can then be converted to methionine by a methyl transfer involving N5-methyltetrahydrofolate (Taylor and Weissbach, 1973). AdoMet is also used for reactions in which the carbon chain from methionine is transfered, instead of the methyl group, producing 5’-methylthioadenosine (MeSAdo). An example of this type of reaction is the synthesis of polyamines, where AdoMet supplies a propylamine moiety, leaving MeSAdo as a product (Tabor et al., 1958)."

https://openalex.org/W1516016685,"A unique form of inhibition by NADH and partial reversal by NAD+ has been demonstrated with Escherichia coli lipoamide dehydrogenase. Substrate inhibition by NADH is consistent with its reduction of the active two-electron reduced enzyme intermediate to the inactive four-electron reduced form. NAD+ partially overcomes this inhibition by mass action reversal of this reduction. NAD+ activation is only partial since the presence of both NAD+ and NADH forces the accumulation of two binary enzyme-pyridine nucleotide complexes. These are intermediates in the two-electron to four-electron reduction of the enzyme and thus are not on the catalytic pathway. NAD+ is also shown to inhibit by binding to the oxidized enzyme to give a dead-end complex. From the steady state rate equations, it is apparent that the degree of inhibition will depend on the oxidation-reduction potential for two- to four-electron reduction of the enzyme. Thus, the wide variation in the severity of NADH inhibition between the E. coli and pig heart enzymes is explained by quantitative differences in the basic lipoamide dehydrogenase mechanism. A possible physiological role for this type of inhibition as a mechanism of control in E. coli is discussed."

These four cDNA clones, representing the three major rat caseins and alpha-lactalbumin, were initially identified by colony hybridization with labeled cDNA probes synthesized from individual mRNA fractions purified by preparative gel electrophoresis. Additional characterization was accomplished by hybridizing individual clones labeled with 32P by nick translation to a Northern gel blot of an enriched fraction of the four major milk protein mRNAs. The individual mRNAs were clearly resolved by electrophoresis on fully denaturing methylmercury hydroxide agarose gels. The identity of each milk protein clone was further established by the location of unique restriction enzyme sites within each clone. Final identification of each clone was performed by hybrid-arrested cell-free translation. The sizes of the milk protein cDNA clones ranged frm 70% for the alpha-lactalbumin gene to essentially full length for the gamma-casein gene, in comparison to their respective mRNAs.

https://openalex.org/W1502304688,"Limited proteolytic digestion of adipocytes with tryp- sin leads to a stimulation of fat cell glucose transport and oxidation. This effect is dose-dependent and reaches half the maximal value due to insulin at ap- proximately 10 cg/ml of protease under the conditions of these experiments. Insulin binding studies reveal that adipocytes exposed to 10 pg/ml of trypsin for 30 min exhibit slightly decreased receptor number but increased affmity for hormone as compared to cells not exposed to the protease. This decrease in receptor num- ber is offset by the simultaneous increase in receptor affinity for insulin such that little change in receptor occupancy is observed at any insulin concentration when control and proteolyzed cells are compared. After treatment with tbie concentration of trypsin, the par- tially activated adipocytes respond further to increas- ing doses of insulin to give maximal glucose oxidation with the same dose-response relationship td hormone as is observed in untreated cells (EDa = 10-‘“~). Adipocytes treated with trypsin (2 to 60 pg/ml) were subjected to affinity cross-linking of ‘z%insulin to re- ceptor complexes (Pilch, P. F., and Czech, M. P. (1979) J Biol. Chem. 254,3375-3381 and (1980) 265,1722-1731) in order to visualize the extent of receptor proteolysis under these conditions. At least four major fragments of the insulin receptor are generated and a correlation between proteolysis of the native receptor, iV& = 350,000 and the insulinomimetic effect of trypsin is observed. Other plasma membrane proteins undergo no demon- strable proteolytic degradation under these conditions when the gels are stained for protein or carbohydrate. These data suggest that the insulinomimetic effect of trypsin is a result of direct proteolysis of the insulin receptor. When proteolysis is performed subsequent to affinity cross-linking, the labeled receptor fragments remain tightly associated with the plasma membrane and none are seen in the incubation medium. The ob- served limited tryptic digestion of receptor at low pro- tease concentrations (10 pg/ml) probably occurs at sites peripheral to the insulin binding domain. * This work was supported by Grants AM-17893 and HD-11343"

AdoMet affects the initiation of transcription but not chain elongation. It is required for each reinitiation step during multiple transcription cycles. Under limited conditions of synthesis in reaction mixtures depleted of UTP and CTP, a greater amount of initiator oligonucleotides was formed in the presence of AdoMet than in its absence. These small oligonucleotides were also formed along with the completed mRNA under conditions of mRNA formation. Although these capped (or uncapped) oligonucleotides corresponded to the 5'-terminal sequence of cytoplasmic polyhedrosis virus mRNA, they failed to substitute for AdoMet in promoting mRNA synthesis. Efficient synthesis of mRNA containing 5'-m7GpppAmpG was dependent on the concentrations of AdoMet and the initiating nucleotide, ATP. There was also an inverse relationship between AdoMet and ATP concentrations such that the apparent Km for ATP was decreased strikingly from 10 to 0.25 mM as the AdoMet concentration was increased from 5 to 500 microM. This effect was observed only for ATP. Double reciprocal plots for estimating the Km of ATP formed concave upward curves but became linear upon addition of a higher concentration of AdoMet, indicating a positive cooperativity of ATP and allosteric effect of AdoMet in the initiation process. Stimulation of transcription by lowering the Km for the initiating nucleotide at the promoter site is proposed as a model for positive regulation of eukaryotic gene expression."

The present study examined whether the failure to cleave Pre-Prl to prolactin inhibits the translocation of the peptide chain across the membrane of the endoplasmic reticulum. In homogenates of pituitary tissue Pre-Prl, prolactin, and growth hormone were not degraded by added proteases. If 0.1% Triton X-100 was added with the proteases these proteins were degraded, suggesting that protection of these proteins from proteases was conferred by membrane vesicles. When Pre-Prl synthesized in a cell-free system was mixed and homogenized with pituitary tissue, it was completely degraded by these enzymes. Thus, protease-resistant Pre-Prl was not the result of nonspecific vesicular entrapment of free Pre-Prl during homogenization. Pre-Prl synthesized in isolated pituitaries copurified with the membrane fraction when the vesicles were isolated from tissue homogenates by flotation in 60% sucrose, and sonication and low concentrations of detergent released Pre-Prl from this fraction.

https://openalex.org/W1579263902,"Protein synthesis initiation factor eIF-2 has been isolated from the high speed supernatant fraction of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. This purification steps include ammonium sulfate fractionation, column chromatography on Sephacryl 300 and hydroxyapatite, and glycerol gradient sedimentation. Electrophoresis of the purified factor on sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gels reveals three polypeptides with a total Mr of 127,000. The molecular weights of the subunits are 31,000, 46,500, and 49,600. The pI of each of these subunits is 4.5, 7.3, and 8.6, respectively. The stoichiometry of the subunits varies from 1:1:1 to 1:0.25:1 suggesting that the active factor may be composed of only two subunits with total Mr of 80,000. The factor is part of a high molecular weight complex during the first steps of the purification. Prior to chromatography on Sephacryl, this complex is broken up in high salt. The activity of the factor is stabilized by inclusion of GDP in all buffers during the preparation and is stimulated by magnesium ion."
https://openalex.org/W1515728570,"We have previously presented evidence that acyl dihydroxyacetone phosphate is converted to O-alkyl dihydroxyacetone phosphate via an endiol intermediate which then accepts a fatty alcohol to form O-alkyl dihydroxyacetone phosphate. We have further proposed that, in the absence of fatty alcohol, the endiol derivative of acyl dihydroxyacetone phosphate reacts with water to form dihydroxyacetone phosphate. In support of this hypothesis, we have shown, in an O-alkyl generating system, that the amount of hydrogen released from acyl dihydroxyacetone phosphate in the formation of the endiol is greater than the amount of hydrogen lost from the total lipid present at the end of incubation. The discrepancy is greater in the absence of added hexadecanol. The balance of the hydrogen loss can be accounted for by the formation of a non-lipid substance which was identified as dihydroxyacetone phosphate."
https://openalex.org/W1546244183,"The location of ribosomal protein L7/L12 has been examined by fluorescence spectroscopy. Protein L7 modified mainly at the COOH terminus by 5-(iodoacetamidoethyl)-aminonaphthalene-1-sulfonic acid, and yeast tRNAPhe-containing fluorescent dyes located specifically near the anticodon or at the 3'-end were used in these studies. Fluorescence-quenching measurements indicate that the COOH terminus of protein L7/L12 is very accessible to the solvent. Steady state anisotropy measurements indicate that this region has a high degree of rotational mobility. Singlet-singlet energy transfer measurements show that the COOH-terminal region of L7/L12 is far away from the peptidyltransferase center, and the main body of the ribosome in general. These results are most easily explained if all four copies of L7/L12 are in a parallel arrangement. Further energy transfer experiments show that the COOH terminus of L7/L12 must be greater than 70 A away from both the 3'-end and the anticodon region of ribosome-bound tRNAs. This indicates that all four copies of L7/L12 must be oriented so that their COOH termini are far away from the tRNAs. However, changes in both the spectrum and anisotropy of labeled L7/L12 accompany tRNA binding. The most simple explanation for these results is a structural change in the 70 S ribosome which somehow alters the environment or location of L7/L12 when tRNA is present. One simple possibility is an alteration in the quaternary arrangement of the multiple copies of L7/L12."
https://openalex.org/W1485043955,"Yeast enolase was subjected to chemical and enzymatic fragmentation, and the individual peptides produced were isolated by gel filtration and ion exchange chromatography. The chemical fragmentation was achieved by cleavage at the single cysteine residue with 2-nitro-5-thiocyanobenzoic acid, or at the 5 methionine residues with cyanogen bromide. The assignment of the two 2-nitro-5-thiocyanobenzoic acid fragments to the NH2-terminal or COOH-terminal regions (designated C1 and C2, respectively) of the enolase subunit could be done unequivocally on the basis of NH2-terminal and COOH-terminal analysis, and the same was the case for the NH2-terminal and COOH-terminal cyanogen bromide peptides (designated M1 and M6, respectively). From a comparison of the CNBr peptides from enolase with those from Fragment C1, the identity of methionine peptides M4, of which only the NH2-terminal half is present in C1, and M5, which along with M6 is missing in C1, could also be established. The major enzymatic fragmentation was achieved by tryptic cleavage at the 14 arginine residues after acetylation of the lysine residues. Based on overlaps with methionine peptides, most of the arginine peptides could be ordered in proper sequence during the early phases of the work. Because of the size of several of the primary fragments, secondary cleavages were required for optimal sequencing data. These secondary cleavages were accomplished by digestion with Staphylococcus aureus protease, or by tryptic cleavage at cysteine after aminoethylation."
https://openalex.org/W1547221818,"In vivo studies were carried out on three bile fistula patients to further elucidate the side chain oxidation pathways from C-27 bile acids to cholic acid in man. Two patients each received (25-R)- and (25-S)-3 alpha, 7 alpha,-12 alpha-trihydroxy-5 beta-[7 beta-3H]cholestanoic acid (THCA) on consecutive days and three patients wee administered 3 alpha, 7 alpha, 12 alhpa, 24 xi-tetrahydroxy-5 beta-[7 beta-3H]cholestanoic acid (varanic acid). The varanic acid was biosynthetically prepared with rat liver microsomes and was probably the 24 alpha isomer. The patients efficiently (84 to 97%) converted both (R)- and (S)-THCA to cholic acid. There was no apparent significant difference in the ability of either (R)- or (S)-THCA to form cholic acid. Varanic acid was poorly converted (20 to 27%) to cholic acid in all three patients. From 49 to 75% of the administered 3H activity was recovered in the bile as other labeled products. The bulk (30 to 35%) of this 3H activity was identified by thin layer chromatography as varanic acid. The rate of conversion of (R)-THCA, (S)-THCA, and varanic acid was extremely rapid in all three patients with a t 1/2 of 35 to 74 min. The findings suggest that (a) the stereospecific configuration at C-25 of THCA has no significant effect on the efficiency of side chain oxidation to cholic acid; and (b) side chain cleavage pathways may exist which do not pass through varanic acid, or the oxidation of varanic acid in man is highly stereospecific with respect to the hydroxyl group at C-24. To prove the latter, it will be necessary to compare the metabolism of the 24 alpha and 24 beta isomers of varanic acid."
https://openalex.org/W1580644621,"A mutant in the Escherichia coli lac permease, called Yf, appears to be defective in the biogenesis and proper assembly of this membrane protein. It was proposed that this defect led to the accumulation of a precursor of the mutant permease (Fried, V. A. (1977) J. Mol Biol. 114, 477-490). In this communication, evidence is presented that the lacYf mutant accumulates a novel lac-specific soluble polypeptide with a molecular weight of 87,000. Detected by double-label analysis on sodium dodecyl sulfate gels, and identified as a lac-specific polypeptide on a two-dimensional gel system, this polypeptide is immunoprecipitated by anti-transacetylase antibody. Pulse-chase experiments are consistent with the hypothesis that it is converted in vivo into a lac-specific membrane protein with an apparent molecular weight of 28,000, which appears to be the mutant lac permease. The results suggest that the 87,000-dalton soluble protein is a precursor of the mutant lac permease. It is proposed that this precursor is a polyprotein chimera containing both the lacY and lacA gene products."

https://openalex.org/W1595613154,"A temperature-sensitive mutant sigma subunit (rpoD800) purified from Escherichia coli was inactivated in vitro by temperatures in excess of 37 degrees C whereas wild type sigma remained stable up to 49 degrees C. Both temperature-sensitive and wild type sigma formed multimeric aggregates upon thermal inactivation which were visualized by electron microscopy as polymeric chains. Conditions favoring sigma monomer (low sigma concentration and binding to core polymerase) protected temperature-sensitive sigma from heat inactivation. Full activity was recovered from inactivated temperature-sensitive sigma aggregates by incubation in a buffer containing 6 M guanidine HCl and subsequent removal of denaturant by dilution. Both wild type and temperature-sensitive sigma recovered full activity levels, retaining their characteristic thermal inactivation temperatures after denaturation in 6 M guanidine HCl and renaturation. Transcription of T4 DNA by RNA polymerase containing the rpoD800 mutant sigma subunit remained undiminished for 10 min after shift up to 46 degrees C but was almost completely inhibited within the following 10 to 15 min."
https://openalex.org/W1566232238,"Automated Edman degradation of alpha 1-acid glycoprotein from serum (serum AGP) was successful only after the desialylated, reduced, and alkylated protein had been treated with pyroglutamate aminopeptidase. The sequence is (less than Glu)-Asn-Pro-Glu-Pro-Ala-X-Ile-Thr-Leu-Gly-Ile-Pro-Ile-. For radioactive sequencing of the NH2 terminus of the intracellular precursor form (liver AGP) of serum AGP, protein was labeled by incubating liver cells in suspension with either [3H]proline or [3H]isoleucine for a 15-min period. Liver AGP was separated from serum AGP by ion exchange chromatography. Between 78 and 90% of the radioactivity incorporated into total AGP was associated with liver AGP, indicating that little conversion of newly synthesized liver AGP to serum AGP had occurred during the 15-min incubation period. Liver AGP was then isolated by immunoprecipitation. The antigen-antibody complex was exposed to 15 Edman degradation cycles; however, no radioactivity was released. Automated Edman degradation of liver AGP which had been extracted from the immunoprecipitate with dilute acid and subsequently treated with pyroglutamate aminopeptidase yielded a sequence of proline and isoleucine identical with that in serum AGP. We conclude that processing of the intracellular precursor form of AGP does not involve a proteolytic trimming near the NH2 terminus."
