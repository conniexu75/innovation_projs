https://openalex.org/W3009912996,"The recent emergence of the novel, pathogenic SARS-coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in China and its rapid national and international spread pose a global health emergency. Cell entry of coronaviruses depends on binding of the viral spike (S) proteins to cellular receptors and on S protein priming by host cell proteases. Unravelling which cellular factors are used by SARS-CoV-2 for entry might provide insights into viral transmission and reveal therapeutic targets. Here, we demonstrate that SARS-CoV-2 uses the SARS-CoV receptor ACE2 for entry and the serine protease TMPRSS2 for S protein priming. A TMPRSS2 inhibitor approved for clinical use blocked entry and might constitute a treatment option. Finally, we show that the sera from convalescent SARS patients cross-neutralized SARS-2-S-driven entry. Our results reveal important commonalities between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV infection and identify a potential target for antiviral intervention."
https://openalex.org/W3009570993,"Whole-genome doubling (WGD) is a prevalent event in cancer, involving a doubling of the entire chromosome complement. However, despite its prevalence and prognostic relevance, the evolutionary selection pressures for WGD in cancer have not been investigated. Here, we combine evolutionary simulations with an analysis of cancer sequencing data to explore WGD during cancer evolution. Simulations suggest that WGD can be selected to mitigate the irreversible, ratchet-like, accumulation of deleterious somatic alterations, provided that they occur at a sufficiently high rate. Consistent with this, we observe an enrichment for WGD in tumor types with extensive loss of heterozygosity, including lung squamous cell carcinoma and triple-negative breast cancers, and we find evidence for negative selection against homozygous loss of essential genes before, but not after, WGD. Finally, we demonstrate that loss of heterozygosity and temporal dissection of mutations can be exploited to identify novel tumor suppressor genes and to obtain a deeper characterization of known cancer genes."
https://openalex.org/W3009954736,"Structural rules underlying functional properties of cortical circuits are poorly understood. To explore these rules systematically, we integrated information from extensive literature curation and large-scale experimental surveys into a data-driven, biologically realistic simulation of the awake mouse primary visual cortex. The model was constructed at two levels of granularity, using either biophysically detailed or point neurons. Both variants have identical network connectivity and were compared to each other and to experimental recordings of visual-driven neural activity. While tuning these networks to recapitulate experimental data, we identified rules governing cell-class-specific connectivity and synaptic strengths. These structural constraints constitute hypotheses that can be tested experimentally. Despite their distinct single-cell abstraction, both spatially extended and point models perform similarly at the level of firing rate distributions for the questions we investigated. All data and models are freely available as a resource for the community."
https://openalex.org/W3009921395,"Summary Understanding molecular mechanisms that dictate B cell diversity is important for targeting B cells as anti-cancer treatment. Through the single-cell dissection of B cell heterogeneity in longitudinal samples of patients with breast cancer before and after neoadjuvant chemotherapy, we revealed that an ICOSL+ B cell subset emerges after chemotherapy. Using three immunocompetent mouse models, we recapitulated the subset switch of human tumor-infiltrating B cells during chemotherapy. By employing B-cell-specific deletion mice, we showed that ICOSL in B cells boosts anti-tumor immunity by enhancing the effector to regulatory TÂ cell ratio. The signature of ICOSL+ B cells is imprinted by complement-CR2 signaling, which is triggered by immunogenic cell death. Moreover, we identified that CD55, a complement inhibitory protein, determines the opposite roles of B cells in chemotherapy. Collectively, we demonstrated a critical role of the B cell subset switch in chemotherapy response, which has implications in designing novel anti-cancer therapies.

https://openalex.org/W3009808659,"Transcription-coupled nucleotide excision repair (TC-NER) is initiated by the stalling of elongating RNA polymerase II (RNAPIIo) at DNA lesions. The ubiquitination of RNAPIIo in response to DNA damage is an evolutionarily conserved event, but its function in mammals is unknown. Here, we identified a single DNA damage-induced ubiquitination site in RNAPII at RPB1-K1268, which regulates transcription recovery and DNA damage resistance. Mechanistically, RPB1-K1268 ubiquitination stimulates the association of the core-TFIIH complex with stalled RNAPIIo through a transfer mechanism that also involves UVSSA-K414 ubiquitination. We developed a strand-specific ChIP-seq method, which revealed RPB1-K1268 ubiquitination is important for repair and the resolution of transcriptional bottlenecks at DNA lesions. Finally, RPB1-K1268R knockin mice displayed a short life-span, premature aging, and neurodegeneration. Our results reveal RNAPII ubiquitination provides a two-tier protection mechanism by activating TC-NER and, in parallel, the processing of DNA damage-stalled RNAPIIo, which together prevent prolonged transcription arrest and protect against neurodegeneration."
https://openalex.org/W3009937536,"The mechanosensitive Piezo1 and Piezo2 channels convert mechanical force into cation permeation. However, their precise mechanogating and regulatory mechanisms remain elusive. Here, we report that Piezo1 utilizes three lateral ion-conducting portals equipped with physical gates for cooperative gating and splicing regulation. Mutating residues lining the portal converts Piezo1 into an anion-selective channel, demonstrating the portal-based cation-permeating pathway. Intriguingly, the portal is physically blocked with a plug domain, which undergoes alternative splicing in both Piezo1 and Piezo2. The Piezo1 isoform has local openings of the portals, enlarged single-channel conductance and sensitized mechanosensitivity. Remarkably, the three plugs are strategically latched onto the central axis for coordinated gating of the three portals. Disrupting the latching induces three quantal sub-conductance states in Piezo1, but not in the isoform. Together, we propose that Piezo utilizes an elegant plug-and-latch mechanism to physically and coordinately gate the lateral portals through the spliceable plug gates."
https://openalex.org/W3010503111,"This paper proposes a new supervised method for blood vessel segmentation using Zernike moment-based shape descriptors. The method implements a pixel wise classification by computing a 11-D feature vector comprising of both statistical (gray-level) features and shape-based (Zernike moment) features. Also the feature set contains optimal coefficients of the Zernike Moments which were derived based on the maximum differentiability between the blood vessel and background pixels. A manually selected training points obtained from the training set of the DRIVE dataset, covering all possible manifestations were used for training the ANN-based binary classifier. The method was evaluated on unknown test samples of DRIVE and STARE databases and returned accuracies of 0.945 and 0.9486 respectively, outperforming other existing supervised learning methods. Further, the segmented outputs were able to cover thinner blood vessels better than previous methods, aiding in early detection of pathologies."
https://openalex.org/W3010515960,"One way to assess a neuron's function is to describe all its inputs and outputs. With this goal in mind, we used serial section electron microscopy to map 899 synaptic inputs and 623 outputs in one inhibitory interneuron in a large volume of the mouse visual thalamus. This neuron innervated 256 thalamocortical cells spread across functionally distinct subregions of the visual thalamus. All but one of its neurites were bifunctional, innervating thalamocortical and local interneurons while also receiving synapses from the retina. We observed a wide variety of local synaptic motifs. While this neuron innervated many cells weakly, with single en passant synapses, it also deployed specialized branches that climbed along other dendrites to form strong multi-synaptic connections with a subset of partners. This neuron's diverse range of synaptic relationships allows it to participate in a mix of global and local processing but defies assigning it a single circuit function."
https://openalex.org/W3010450056,"Introduction Aggression is a clinical symptom of various psychiatric disorders that can be conceptualised as a physical act towards another person with the intent to cause harm. In antisocial personality disorder (ASPD), aggression is a frequent manifestation that differently compromise therapeutic and prognostic goals according to its impulsive or premeditated categorisation. ASPD is characterised by high levels of impulsivity, psychopathic traits, and a high prevalence of co-morbid substance use disorders (SUDs). Aggression in ASPD patients may determine long and recurrent imprisonment thus representing a challenge clinicians and legal experts face. Objectives Our aims were to characterise impulsive and premeditated aggression in male ASPD offenders as well as to determine the potential role of SUDs, impulsivity, and psychopathic traits as predictors. Materials and methods In this cross-sectional study we evaluated a sample of ASPD offenders with a battery of clinical and psychometric, standardised instruments: the Psychopathy Checklist-Revised (PCL-R), the European Version of the Addiction Severity Index (EuropASI), the Barratt Impulsivity Scale Version 11 (BIS-11), and the Impulsive/Premeditated Aggression Scale (IPAS). Results We used a total sample of 134 offenders, all of whom were male. ASPD patients (n = 96) had a 71.9% prevalence of impulsive aggression and a 28.1% prevalence of premeditated aggression. ASPD patients with impulsive aggression had significantly lower scores of total PCL-R (p<0.01) factor 1 and interpersonal facet 1 (p<0.05), compared with ASPD patients with premeditated aggression. ASPD patients with impulsive aggression and ASPD patients with premeditated aggression had comparable BIS-11 mean scores, and exhibited an equal prevalence of SUDs. The interpersonal facet 1of the PCL-R predicted the aggression type (p<0.05) in ASPD patients, and the exponential beta value for facet 1 was 1.42 (CI = 1.03; 1.95). Conclusions The aggression type that is associated with ASPD is mainly impulsive in nature. ASPD patients who have higher scores of psychopathic traits have a lower probability of exhibiting impulsive aggression and a higher probability of exhibiting premeditated aggression. Although ASPD patients have high levels of impulsivity and a high frequency of SUDs, these two variables were not predictors of the aggression type."
https://openalex.org/W3009120725,"Life expectancy at a given age is a summary measure of mortality rates present in a population (estimated as the area under the survival curve), and represents the average number of years an individual at that age is expected to live if current age-specific mortality rates apply now and in the future. A complementary metric is the number of Life Years Lost, which is used to measure the reduction in life expectancy for a specific group of persons, for example those diagnosed with a specific disease or condition (e.g. smoking). However, calculation of life expectancy among those with a specific disease is not straightforward for diseases that are not present at birth, and previous studies have considered a fixed age at onset of the disease, e.g. at age 15 or 20 years. In this paper, we present the R package lillies (freely available through the Comprehensive R Archive Network; CRAN) to guide the reader on how to implement a recently-introduced method to estimate excess Life Years Lost associated with a disease or condition that overcomes these limitations. In addition, we show how to decompose the total number of Life Years Lost into specific causes of death through a competing risks model, and how to calculate confidence intervals for the estimates using non-parametric bootstrap. We provide a description on how to use the method when the researcher has access to individual-level data (e.g. electronic healthcare and mortality records) and when only aggregated-level data are available."
https://openalex.org/W3009520768,"Background There is a growing focus on the development of multi-factorial cancer risk prediction algorithms alongside tools that operationalise them for clinical use. BOADICEA is a breast and ovarian cancer risk prediction model incorporating genetic and other risk factors. A new user-friendly Web-based tool (CanRisk.org) has been developed to apply BOADICEA. This study aimed to explore the acceptability of the prototype CanRisk tool among two healthcare professional groups to inform further development, evaluation and implementation. Method A multi-methods approach was used. Clinicians from primary care and specialist genetics clinics in England, France and Germany were invited to use the CanRisk prototype with two test cases (either face-to-face with a simulated patient or via a written vignette). Their views about the tool were examined via a semi-structured interview or equivalent open-ended questionnaire. Qualitative data were subjected to thematic analysis and organised around Sekhonâs Theoretical Framework of Acceptability. Results Seventy-five clinicians participated, 21 from primary care and 54 from specialist genetics clinics. Participants were from England (n = 37), France (n = 23) and Germany (n = 15). The prototype CanRisk tool was generally acceptable to most participants due to its intuitive design. Primary care clinicians were concerned about the amount of time needed to complete, interpret and communicate risk information. Clinicians from both settings were apprehensive about the impact of the CanRisk tool on their consultations and lack of opportunities to interpret risk scores before sharing them with their patients. Conclusions The findings highlight the challenges associated with developing a complex tool for use in different clinical settings; they also helped refine the tool. This prototype may not have been versatile enough for clinical use in both primary care and specialist genetics clinics where the needs of clinicians are different, emphasising the importance of understanding the clinical context when developing cancer risk assessment tools."
https://openalex.org/W3009214221,"Background Intimate partner violence (IPV) is prevalent in high- as well as low-income contexts. It results in a substantial public health burden and significant negative socioeconomic and health outcomes throughout the life-course. However, limited knowledge exists about IPV during early adolescence. This period is critical during the transition to adulthood for at least two reasons: it is when the majority of adolescents in low-income countries first encounter dating, sexuality and partnerships, often with older adolescents or adults, and it is also the period when lifelong patterns of violence and norms about acceptable IPV are formed. The current study is one of the first to measure IPV prevalence among young adolescents in a low-income setting, examine the potential etiology, and investigate relationships with gender ideology, poverty, mental health and childhood adversity. Methods We surveyed 2,089 adolescents aged 10â16 in Malawi using standardized instruments. We estimated the prevalence of IPV, and use multivariate logistic regression to test potential correlates. Results More than a quarter (27%) of ever-partnered adolescents in Malawi report being victimized. A substantial proportion of both male and female adolescents (15%) report committing violence against their partner. Girls were more likely than boys to report being a victim of sexual IPV (24% versus 8%), and boys more likely to perpetrate such (9% versus 1%). Almost 10% of the sample had both committed and been a victim of IPV. Cumulative childhood adversity (e.g., physical abuse, witnessing domestic violence) was a consistent and strong correlate of IPV victimization (adjusted odds ratio (aOR) 1.30) and of perpetration (aOR 1.35). Depression and PTSD were likewise associated with IPV victimization in the overall sample. Notably, gender ideology was not predictive of either victimization or perpetration, even among boys. Conclusions IPV is common for both male and female young Malawian adolescents, and includes both victimization and perpetration. IPV compounds other adversities experienced by adolescents in this low-income setting, and it is rarely alleviated through help from the health system or other formal support. These findings underscore the need to intervene early when interventions can still break destructive pathways and help foster healthier relationships. This focus on early adolescence is particularly critical in low-income countries given the early onset and rapid pace of the transition to adulthood, with sexual activity, dating and partnership thus being common already in young adolescence. Promising interventions would be those that reduce violence against or around children, as well as those that reduce the impacts of such trauma on mental health during adolescence."
https://openalex.org/W3009099899,"Adherence to antiretroviral therapy (ART) is essential to achieving an improved cluster of differentiation-4 (CD4) count, viral load, and quality of life while preventing drug resistance. Medication adherence among people living with Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) is influenced by different factors. Several studies have identified adherence promoters and inhibitors that emanate from the internal and external environment. We conducted six (6) individual in-depth interviews and three (3) focus group discussions to explore adherence behaviour among patients diagnosed with HIV in a teaching hospital in Accra, Ghana. Participants were drawn from the intervention arm of a mobile phone adherence intervention program. They had been enrolled in the study for at least six (6) months before the interviews are conducted. Results revealed that participants adhered to treatment irrespective of prompts from significant others. Adherence promoters included perception of ART as part of daily routines, benefits of the ART, awareness of regimen, access to food, and transparency. Adherence inhibitors were forgetfulness, secrecy, waiting time, religious beliefs, and sleep. People living with HIV (PLWHIV) have the personal motivation to take medication; however, negative perceptions about HIV must be addressed to ensure optimum adherence behaviour."
https://openalex.org/W3009226488,"The maintenance of muscle function is extremely important for whole body health and exercise is essential to this process. The ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) is required for muscle adaptation following exercise but little is known about acute posttranslational regulation and proteome remodeling during and after high-intensity exercise. Here, we used quantitative proteomics to study ubiquitin signaling dynamics in human skeletal muscle biopsies from healthy males before, during, and after a single bout of high-intensity exercise. Exercise resulted in a marked depletion of protein ubiquitylation in the vastus lateralis muscle consistent with proteasome activation. This was also associated with acute posttranslational modification of protein abundance. Integration of these data with phosphoproteomics identified co-regulated proximal modifications suggesting a cross talk between phosphorylation and ubiquitylation. We also identified additional protein modification cross talk and showed acute activation of protein NEDDylation. In vitro experiments revealed that cAMP-dependent activation of the proteasome requires NEDD8, an ubiquitin-like protein involved in protein NEDDylation, to maintain cellular protein ubiquitylation levels. Our data reveal the complexity of ubiquitin signaling and proteome remodeling in muscle during and after high-intensity exercise. We propose a model whereby exercise and the resulting cAMP signaling activate both the proteasome and ubiquitylation via NEDDylation to rapidly remove potentially damaged proteins."
https://openalex.org/W3010321444,"Nutritional Programming (NP) has been shown to counteract the negative effects of dietary plant protein (PP) by introducing PP at an early age towards enhancement of PP utilization during later life stages. This study explored the effect of NP and its induction time on growth, expression of appetite-stimulating hormones, and any morphological changes in the gut possibly responsible for improved dietary PP utilization. At 3 days post-hatch (dph) zebrafish were distributed into 12 (3 L) tanks, 100 larvae per tank. This study included four groups: 1) The control (NP-FM) group received fishmeal (FM)-based diet from 13-36 dph and was challenged with PP-based diet during 36-66 dph; 2) The NP-PP group received NP with dietary PP in larval stage via live food enrichment during 3-13 dph followed by FM diet during 13-36 dph and PP diet during 36-66 dph; 3) The T-NP group received NP between 13-23 dph through PP diet followed by FM diet during 23-36 dph and PP diet during 36-66 dph; and 4) The PP group received PP diet from 13-66 dph. During the PP challenge the T-NP group achieved the highest weight gain compared to control and PP. Ghrelin expression in the brain was higher in T-NP compared to NP-FM and NP-PP, while in the gut it was reduced in both NP-PP and T-NP groups. Cholecystokinin expression showed an opposite trend to ghrelin. The brain neuropeptide Y expression was lower in NP-PP compared to PP but not different with NP-FM and T-NP groups. The highest villus length to width ratio in the middle intestine was found in T-NP compared to all other groups. The study suggests that NP induced during juvenile stages improves zebrafish growth and affects digestive hormone regulation and morphology of the intestinal lining-possible mechanisms behind the improved PP utilization in pre-adult zebrafish stages."
https://openalex.org/W3010365138,"Reactive oxygen species (ROS) increase during adipogenesis and in obesity. Oxidants react with cysteine residues of proteins to form glutathione (GSH) adducts, S-glutathionylation, that are selectively removed by glutaredoxin-1 (Glrx). We have previously reported that Glrx knockout mice had increased protein S-glutathionylation and developed obesity by an unknown mechanism. In this study, we demonstrated that 3T3L1 adipocytes differentiation increased ROS and protein S-glutathionylation. Glrx ablation elevated protein S-glutathionylation and lipid content in 3T3L1 cells. Glrx replenishment decreased the lipid content of Glrx KO 3T3L1 cells. Glrx KO also increased protein expression and protein S-glutathionylation of the adipogenic transcription factor CCAAT enhancer-binding protein (C/EBP) Î². Protein S-glutathionylation decreased the interaction of C/EBPÎ² and protein inhibitor of activated STAT (PIAS) 1, a small ubiquitin-related modifier E3 ligase that facilitates C/EBPÎ² degradation. Experiments with truncated mutant C/EBPÎ² demonstrated that PIAS1 interacted with the liver-enriched inhibitory protein (LIP) region of C/EBPÎ². Furthermore, mass spectrometry analysis identified protein S-glutathionylation of Cys201 and Cys296 in the LIP region of C/EBPÎ². The C201S, C296S double-mutant C/EBPÎ² prevented protein S-glutathionylation and preserved the interaction with PIAS1. In summary, Glrx ablation stimulated 3T3L1 cell differentiation and adipogenesis via increased protein S-glutathionylation of C/EBPÎ², stabilizing and increasing C/EBPÎ² protein levels."
https://openalex.org/W3010448268,"Background Smoking among adolescents remains a global public health issue as youth continue to maintain high prevalence rates. The evidence for the efficacy of text messaging interventions to reduce smoking behavior is well established, yet there is still a need for studies targeting high school students. The aim of the study was to determine the effectiveness of a text-based smoking cessation intervention among high school students in Sweden. Methods The study was a two-arm randomized trial conducted from January 10 2018 to January 11 2019, data were analysed from April 12 2019 to May 21 2019. Inclusion criteria were high school students who were daily or weekly smokers willing to attempt to quit smoking and owned a mobile phone. The study invited all students at 630 high schools units throughout Sweden. The intervention group received text messages based on components of effective smoking cessation interventions for 12 weeks. The control group were offered treatment as usual. The primary outcomes were self-reported prolonged abstinence (not having smoked more than 5 cigarettes over the last 8 weeks) and 4-week point prevalence of smoking abstinence. Findings A total of 535 participants, with a median age of 17 (IQR 16â18), were randomized into the study; 276 (164 [59.4%] women) were allocated to the intervention and 259 (162 [62.5%] women) to the control group. The outcomes of the trial were analyzed on a total of 212 (76.8%) participants in the intervention group and 201 (77.6%) participants in the control group. Prolonged abstinence at the 3-month follow-up was reported by 49 (23.1%) individuals in the intervention group and 39 (19.4%) individuals in the control group (adjusted OR, 1.21; 95% CI, 0.73â2.01; P value, .46). Four-week point prevalence of complete smoking cessation was reported by 53 (25.0%) individuals in the intervention group and 31 (15.4%) individuals in the control group (adjusted OR, 1.87; 95% CI, 1.12â3.17; P value, .018). Conclusions Estimates of 4-week point prevalence of complete cessation was 10 percentage points higher in the group that were given access to the intervention compared to the control. Findings provide confirmation that text messaging-based smoking cessation programs can affect quit rates among adolescents.

https://openalex.org/W3009256687,"Objectives Large studies are needed to update risk factors of bronchiolitis hospitalization. We performed a nationwide analysis of hospitalization rates for bronchiolitis over four consecutive bronchiolitis seasons to identify underlying medical disorders at risk of bronchiolitis hospitalization and assess their frequency. Methods Data were retrieved from the French National Hospital Discharge database. Of all infants discharged alive from maternity wards from January 2008 to December 2013 in France (N = 3,884,791), we identified four consecutive cohorts at risk of bronchiolitis during the seasons of 2009â2010 to 2012â2013. The main outcome was bronchiolitis hospitalization during a season. Individual risk factors were collected. Results Among infants, 6.0% were preterm and 2.0% had â¥1 chronic condition including 0.2% bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) and 0.2% hemodynamically significant congenital heart disease (HS-CHD). Bronchiolitis hospitalization rates varied between seasons (min: 1.26% in 2010â2011; max: 1.48% in 2012â2013; p<0.001). Except omphalocele, the following conditions were associated with an increased risk for bronchiolitis hospitalization: solid organ (9.052; 95% CI, 4.664â17.567) and stem cell transplants (6.012; 95% CI, 3.441â10.503), muscular dystrophy (4.002; 95% CI, 3.1095â5.152), cardiomyopathy (3.407; 95% CI, 2.613â4.442), HS-CHD (3.404; 95% CI, 3.153â3.675), congenital lung disease and/or bronchial abnormalities, Down syndrome, congenital tracheoesophageal fistula, diaphragmatic hernia, pulmonary hypertension, chromosomal abnormalities other than Down syndrome, hemodynamically non-significant CHD, congenital abnormalities of nervous system, cystic fibrosis, cleft palate, cardiovascular disease occurring during perinatal period, and BPD. Conclusion Besides prematurity, BPD, and HSâCHD, eighteen underlying conditions were associated with a significant increased risk for bronchiolitis hospitalization in a nationwide population."
https://openalex.org/W3010626260,"The placental epigenome plays a critical role in regulating mammalian growth and development. Alterations to placental methylation, often observed at imprinted genes, can lead to adverse pregnancy complications such as intrauterine growth restriction and preterm birth. Similar associations have been observed in offspring derived from advanced paternal age fathers. As parental age at time of conception continues to rise, the impact of advanced paternal age on these reproductive outcomes is a growing concern, but limited information is available on the molecular mechanisms affected in utero. This longitudinal murine research study thus investigated the impact of paternal aging on genomic imprinting in viable F1 embryonic portions of the placentas derived from the same paternal males when they were young (4-6 months) and when they aged (11-15 months). The use of a controlled outbred mouse model enabled analysis of offspring throughout the natural lifetime of the same paternal males and excluded confounding factors like female age or infertility. Firstly, paternal age significantly impacted embryonic placental weight, fetal weight and length. Targeted bisulfite sequencing was utilized to examine imprinted methylation at the Kcnq1ot1 imprinting control region, with significant hypermethylation observed upon natural paternal aging. Quantitative real-time PCR assessed imprinted gene expression levels at various imprinting clusters, resulting in transcript level alterations attributable to advanced paternal age. In summary, our results demonstrate a paternal age effect with dysregulation at numerous imprinted loci, providing a mechanism for future adverse placental and offspring health conditions."
https://openalex.org/W3009574042,"Physiology and nutritional quality of a facultative CAM plant Mesembryanthemum crystallinum under drought stress alone are poorly understood. To induce drought, M. crystallinum was cultured aeroponically with different nutrient spraying intervals such as 5, 30, 60 and 240 min. The long spraying interval such as 240 min resulted in lower mass of root and shoot, shorter total root length with less tips and smaller surface area, compared to short interval of 5 min. Grown under the longest spraying interval of 240 min, M. crystallinumalso had significantly higher leaf dry matter content but lower leaf succulence. However, CAM acidity was undetectable for any plants. Although M. crystallinum grown under extended spraying intervals had higher photosynthetic pigments, they utilized lesser light energy and did not dissipate heat as effectively as those grown under 5 min. Compare to other shorter spraying intervals, photosynthetic gas exchange rates were significantly reduced under 240 min spraying interval, indicating signs of water deficit stress. Shoot nitrate, total reduced nitrogen, total soluble protein and Rubisco concentrations were similar for all plants. For phytochemicals and dietary minerals, plants grown under 240 min spraying interval had significantly higher values than the other plants. Therefore, drought does not result in the induction of CAM but regulates photosynthetic performance and enhances nutritional quality of M. crystallinum."

https://openalex.org/W3009688118,"Type 2 diabetes (T2D) manifests from inadequate glucose control due to insulin resistance, hypoinsulinemia, and deteriorating pancreatic Î²-cell function. The pro-inflammatory factor Activin has been implicated as a positive correlate of severity in T2D patients, and as a negative regulator of glucose uptake by skeletal muscle, and of pancreatic Î²-cell phenotype in mice. Accordingly, we sought to determine whether intervention with the Activin antagonist Follistatin can ameliorate the diabetic pathology. Here, we report that an intravenous Follistatin gene delivery intervention with tropism for striated muscle reduced the serum concentrations of Activin B and improved glycemic control in the db/db mouse model of T2D. Treatment reversed the hyperglycemic progression with a corresponding reduction in the percentage of glycated-hemoglobin to levels similar to lean, healthy mice. Follistatin gene delivery promoted insulinemia and abundance of insulin-positive pancreatic Î²-cells, even when treatment was administered to mice with advanced diabetes, supporting a mechanism for improved glycemic control associated with maintenance of functional Î²-cells. Our data demonstrate that single-dose intravascular Follistatin gene delivery can ameliorate the diabetic progression and improve prognostic markers of disease. These findings are consistent with other observations of Activin-mediated mechanisms exerting deleterious effects in models of obesity and diabetes, and suggest that interventions that attenuate Activin signaling could help further understanding of T2D and the development of novel T2D therapeutics."
https://openalex.org/W3009689204,"This study presents financial network indicators that can be applied to inspect the financial contagion on real economy, as well as the spatial spillover and industry aggregation effects. We propose to design both a directed and undirected networks of financial sectors of top 20 countries in GDP based on symbolized transfer entropy and Pearson correlation coefficients. We examine the effect and usefulness of the network indicators by newly using them instead of the original Dow Jones financial sector as explanatory variables to construct the higher-order information spatial econometric models. The results demonstrate that the estimated accuracies obtained from both the two networks are improved significantly compared with the spatial econometric model using the original data. It indicates that the network indictors are more effective to capture the dynamic information of financial systems. And meanwhile, the accuracy based on the directed network is a little higher than the undirected network, which indicates the symbolized transfer entropy, i.e. the directed and weighted network, is more suitable and effective to reflect relationships in the financial field. In addition, the results also show that under the global financial crisis, the co-movement between financial sectors of a country/region and the global financial sector as well as between financial sectors and real economy sectors is increased. However, some sectors in particular Utilities and Healthcare are impacted slightly. This study tries to use the financial network indicators in modeling to study contagion channels on the real economy and the industry aggregation effects and suggest how network indicators can be practically used in financial fields."
https://openalex.org/W3010008027,"Individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) demonstrate impairments with pragmatic (social) language, including narrative skills and conversational abilities. We aimed to quantitatively characterize narrative performance in ASD using natural language processing techniques: sentiment and language abstraction analyses based on the Linguistic Category Model. Individuals with ASD and with typical development matched for age, gender, ethnicity, and verbal and nonverbal intelligence quotients produced language samples during two standardized tasks from the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule, Second Edition assessment: Telling a Story from a Book and Description of a Picture. Only the narratives produced during the Book Task differed between ASD and control groups in terms of emotional polarity and language abstraction. Participants with typical development used words with positive sentiment more often in comparison to individuals with ASD. In the case of words with negative sentiment, the differences were marginally significant (participants with typical development used words with negative sentiment more often). The Book Task narratives of individuals with ASD were also characterized by a lower level of language abstraction than narratives of peers with typical development. Linguistic abstraction was strongly positively correlated with a higher number of words with emotional polarity. Neither linguistic abstraction nor emotional polarity correlated with participants' age or verbal and nonverbal IQ. The results support the promise of sentiment and language abstraction analyses as a useful tool for the quantitative, fully automated assessment of narrative abilities among individuals with ASD."
https://openalex.org/W3010069459,"Retinal vascular diseases (RVD) have been identified as a major cause of blindness worldwide. These pathologies, including the wet form of age-related macular degeneration, retinopathy of prematurity, and diabetic retinopathy are currently treated by intravitreal delivery of anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) agents. However, repeated intravitreal injections can lead to ocular complications and resistance to these treatments. Thus, there is a need to find new targeted therapies. Nucleolin regulates the endothelial cell (EC) activation and angiogenesis. In previous studies, we designed a pseudopeptide, N6L, that binds the nucleolin and blocks the tumor angiogenesis. In this study, the effect of N6L was investigated in two experimental models of retinopathies including oxygen-induced retinopathy (OIR) and choroidal neovascularization (CNV). We found that in mouse OIR, intraperitoneal injection of N6L is delivered to activated ECs and induced a 50% reduction of pathological neovascularization. The anti-angiogenic effect of N6L has been tested in CNV model in which the systemic injection of N6L induced a 33% reduction of angiogenesis. This effect is comparable to those obtained with VEGF-trap, a standard of care drug for RVD. Interestingly, with preventive and curative treatments, neoangiogenesis is inhibited by 59%. Our results have potential interest in the development of new therapies targeting other molecules than VEGF for RVD."
https://openalex.org/W3009062928,"A Compton camera is a device for imaging a radio-source distribution without using a mechanical collimator. Ordered-subset expectation-maximization (OS-EM) is widely used to reconstruct Compton images. However, the OS-EM algorithm tends to over-concentrate and amplify noise in the reconstructed image. It is, thus, necessary to optimize the number of iterations to develop high-quality images, but this has not yet been achieved. In this paper, we apply a median filter to an OS-EM algorithm and introduce a median root prior expectation-maximization (MRP-EM) algorithm to overcome this problem. In MRP-EM, the median filter is used to update the image in each iteration. We evaluated the quality of images reconstructed by our proposed method and compared them with those reconstructed by conventional algorithms using mathematical phantoms. The spatial resolution was estimated using the images of two point sources. Reproducibility was evaluated on an ellipsoidal phantom by calculating the residual sum of squares, zero-mean normalized cross-correlation, and mutual information. In addition, we evaluated the semi-quantitative performance and uniformity on the ellipsoidal phantom. MRP-EM reduces the generated noise and is robust with respect to the number of iterations. An evaluation of the reconstructed image quality using some statistical indices shows that our proposed method delivers better results than conventional techniques."
https://openalex.org/W3009659641,"Habitat degradation and summer droughts severely restrict feeding options for the endangered southern hairy-nosed wombat (SHNW; Lasiorhinus latifrons). We reconstructed SHNW summer diets by DNA metabarcoding from feces. We initially validated rbcL and ndhJ diet reconstructions using autopsied and captive animals. Subsequent diet reconstructions of wild wombats broadly reflected vegetative ground cover, implying local rather than long-range foraging. Diets were all dominated by alien invasives. Chemical analysis of alien food revealed Carrichtera annua contains high levels of glucosinolates. Clinical examination (7 animals) and autopsy (12 animals) revealed that the most degraded site also contained most individuals showing signs of glucosinolate poisoning. We infer that dietary poisoning through the ingestion of alien invasives may have contributed to the recent population crashes in the region. In floristically diverse sites, individuals appear to be able to manage glucosinolate intake by avoidance or episodic feeding but this strategy is less tractable in the most degraded sites. We conclude that recovery of the most affected populations may require effective Carrichtera management and interim supplementary feeding. More generally, we argue that protection against population decline by poisoning in territorial herbivores requires knowledge of their diet and of those food plants containing toxic principles."
https://openalex.org/W3009057353,"Sugarcane yellow leaf virus (SCYLV), the causal agent of yellow leaf disease, naturally infects at least three plant species in Florida: sugarcane (Saccharum spp.), the weed Columbus grass (Sorghum almum) and cultivated sorghum (S. bicolor). All three hosts are also colonized by the sugarcane aphid (Melanaphis sacchari), the main vector of SCYLV worldwide. To understand the high incidence of SCYLV observed in sugarcane commercial fields and in germplasm collections, we investigated the transmission efficiency of SCYLV from sugarcane and Columbus grass to sugarcane using the sugarcane aphid and a spider mite (Oligonychus grypus) that also tested positive for SCYLV in Florida. Healthy and SCYLV-infected leaf pieces of sugarcane and Columbus grass carrying viruliferous aphids or spider mites were transferred to virus-free plants of the yellow leaf susceptible sugarcane cultivar CP96-1252. Three- and 6-months post inoculation, the 108 aphid-inoculated plants of Columbus grass and the 90 mite-inoculated plants of sugarcane tested negative for SCYLV by tissue blot immunoassay (TBIA) or reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Similar results were obtained for 162 aphid-inoculated plants of sugarcane, except for two plants that tested positive for SCYLV by TBIA and RT-PCR. In two field experiments planted with SCYLV-free and virus-infected sugarcane (cultivar CP96-1252), only 18â28% of healthy plants became infected during a 24- to 28-month period. SCYLV prevalence in these field experiments did not differ between aphicide treated and untreated plots. Incidence of M. sacchari haplotypes in the Everglades agricultural area also indicated that the predominant haplotype that is currently colonizing sugarcane was not a vector of SCYLV in Florida. Lack of virus transmission by the spider mite suggested that this arthropod only acquired the virus when feeding on infected plants but was unable to transmit SCYLV. The current vector of SCYLV in Florida remains to be identified."
https://openalex.org/W3009293090,"Circular leaf spot, caused by the ascomycetous fungus Plurivorosphaerella nawae (= Mycosphaerella nawae), is the most problematic fungal disease of persimmon worldwide. In Korea, persimmon exposed to P. nawae inoculum (ascospores) from May to August shows visible circular leaf spot disease symptoms from the end of August to early September. It is important to identify factors affecting this long latent period. The objective of this study was to elucidate the relation between the development of symptom of circular leaf spot and the content of phenolics compounds and vitamin C as well as the antioxidant activities in leaves. Healthy leaves (both young and old) and infected leaves of circular leaf spot-susceptible persimmon cultivar were harvested in 2016. The content of phenolics (total phenols, flavonoids, and tannins) and vitamin C, and their antioxidant activities were analyzed in all types of leaves. Compared with the asymptomatic leaves (old) and the asymptomatic parts of the infected leaves, the symptomatic parts of the infected leaves, symptomatic leaves, and asymptomatic young leaves showed significantly higher content of phenolics and vitamin C, and higher antioxidant activities. Disease incidence and severity were estimated for older leaves (emerged in early May) and younger leaves (emerged at the end of June) in 2017 and 2018. The AUDPC was higher in old leaves than younger leaves. The disease progression was much faster and severe in the older than in the younger leaves. Similar results were found in field experiments. Higher content of phenolics and antioxidant activities in the younger leaves may contribute to circular leaf spot resistance in persimmon. Furthermore, accumulation of phenolics and antioxidant activity in the infected leaves is a post-infection response and the first stage of the defense mechanism."
https://openalex.org/W3009904381,"A potentially effective way to influence peopleâs fire prevention behavior is letting them experience a fire in an immersive virtual environment (IVE). We analyze the effects of experiencing a fire in an IVE (versus an information sheet) on psychological determinants of behaviorâknowledge, vulnerability, severity, self-efficacy, and locus of controlâbased mainly on arguments from Protection Motivation Theory and the Health Belief Model. Crucial in our setup is that we also relate these determinants to actual prevention behavior. Results show that IVE has the hypothesized effects on vulnerability, severity, and self-efficacy, and an unexpected negative effect on knowledge. Only knowledge and vulnerability showed subsequent indirect effects on actual prevention behavior. There remains a direct positive effect of IVE on prevention behavior that cannot be explained by any of the determinants. Our results contradict the implicit assumption that an induced change in these psychological determinants by IVE, necessarily implies a change in behavior. A recommendation for research on the effects of IVEâs is, whenever possible, to study the actual target behavior as well."
https://openalex.org/W3010048850,"Introduction Chronic kidney disease of unknown origin (CKDu) is an epidemic concentrated in agricultural communities in Central and South America, including young, male sugarcane harvesters. The purpose of this analysis is to understand early changes in kidney function among a cohort of first-time sugarcane harvesters and to determine risk factors for kidney function decline. Methods Joint latent class mixed models were used to model sub-population kidney function trajectory over the course of 4 years (2012â2016). Probability weighted logistic regression was used to determine personal health, community, and individual behavior risk factors associated with sub-population assignment. Data analysis occurred in 2019. Results Of 181 new workers median age 19 years old (IQR: 4), 39 (22%) were identified as having non-stable kidney function with an annual age-adjusted decline of estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of -1.0 ml/min per 1.73 m2 (95% CI: -3.4, 1.3). Kidney function (OR: 0.96; 95% CI: 0.93, 0.98), mild hypertension (OR: 5.21; 95% CI: 2.14, 13.94), and having a local home of residence (OR: 7.12; 95% CI: 2.41, 26.02) prior to employment in sugarcane were associated with non-stable eGFR sub-population assignment. Conclusions Mild hypertension may be an early indicator of the development of CKDu. A better understanding of preexisting risk factors is needed to determine why individuals are entering the workforce with reduced kidney function and elevated blood pressure and increased risk of renal function decline."
https://openalex.org/W3009064300,"Dredging is considered a major threat/impedance to anadromous fish migrating to spawning habitat. Due to the perceived threat caused by dredging, environmental windows that restrict dredge operations are enforced within many rivers along the east coast. However, it is generally unknown how anadromous fish react to encountering an active dredge during spawning migrations. Atlantic sturgeon (ATS) are an endangered, anadromous species along the Atlantic slope of North America. To determine if and how an active dredge may affect ATS spawning migration, a Vemco Positioning System array was deployed around an active hydraulic-cutterhead dredge that adult ATS must traverse to reach spawning habitat in the James River, VA. Telemetry data showed that all ATS that entered the study area survived. ATS that migrated upstream during dredge operations (N = 103) traversed the dredge area and continued upstream to spawning habitat. Many ATS made multiple trips through the study area during dredge operations. There was no noticeable difference in swim behavior regardless of whether the dredge was absent or working within the study area. We suggest that dredging in the lower James River does not create a barrier for adult ATS migrating to spawning habitat or cause adults to significantly modify swim behavior. This is the first study to utilize fine-scale telemetry data to describe how an organism moves in relation to an active dredge. This methodology could be used to describe dredge-sturgeon interactions on different life stages and in other locations and could be expanded to other aquatic organisms of concern."
https://openalex.org/W3009152033,"Background 
Psychological war trauma among displaced refugees is an established risk factor for mental health disorders, especially post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Persons with trauma-induced disorders have heightened neuroplastic restructuring of limbic brain circuits (e.g., amygdala and hippocampus), which are critical factors in the pathophysiology of PTSD. Civilians in war are exposed to both psychological trauma and environmental hazards, such as metals. Little is known about the possible mental health impact from such environmental exposures, alone or in combination with trauma. It is of special interest to determine whether war exposures contribute to dysfunctional neuroplasticity; that is, an adverse outcome from sustained stress contributing to mental health disorders. The current study examined Middle Eastern refugees in the United States to determine the relationships among pre-displacement trauma and environmental exposures, brain derived neurotrophic growth factor (BDNF) and nerve growth factor (NGF)âtwo neurotrophins reported to mediate neuroplasticity responses to stress-related exposuresâand mental health.


Methods 
Middle Eastern refugees (n = 64; 33 men, 31 women) from Syria (n = 40) or Iraq (n = 24) were assessed 1 month after arrival to Michigan, US. Participants were interviewed in Arabic using a semi-structured survey to assess pre-displacement trauma and environmental exposure, PTSD, depression, anxiety, and self-rated mental health. Whole blood was collected, and concentrations of six heavy metals as well as BDNF and NGF levels were determined. Because these two neurotrophins have similar functions in neuroplasticity, we combined them to create a neuroplasticity index. Linear regression tested whether psychosocial trauma, environmental exposures and biomarkers were associated with mental health symptoms.


Findings 
The neuroplasticity index was associated with PTSD (standardized beta, Î² = 0.25, p < 0.05), depression (0.26, < 0.05) and anxiety (0.32, < 0.01) after controlling for pre-displacement trauma exposures. In addition, pre-displacement environmental exposure was associated with PTSD (0.28, < 0.05) and anxiety (0.32, < 0.05). Syrian refugees and female gender were associated with higher scores on depression (0.25, < 0.05; 0.30, < 0.05) and anxiety scales (0.35, < 0.01; 0.27, < 0.05), and worse on self-rated mental health (0.32, < 0.05; 0.34, < 0.05). In bivariate analysis, the neuroplasticity index was related to blood lead levels (r = 0.40; p < 0.01).


Conclusions 
The current study confirms the adverse effects of war trauma on mental health. Higher levels of biomarkers of neuroplasticity correlated with worse mental health and higher blood lead levels. Higher neurotrophin levels in refugees might indicate dysfunctional neuroplasticity with increased consolidation of adverse war memories in the limbic system. Such a process may contribute to psychiatric symptoms. Further research is needed to clarify the pathobiological mechanisms linking war trauma and environmental exposures to adverse mental health."
https://openalex.org/W3009306359,"Orthaga olivacea Warre (Lepidoptera: Pyralidae) is an important agricultural pest of camphor trees (Cinnamomum camphora). To further supplement the known genome-level features of related species, the complete mitochondrial genome of Orthaga olivacea is amplified, sequenced, annotated, analyzed, and compared with 58 other species of Lepidopteran. The complete sequence is 15,174 bp, containing 13 protein-coding genes (PCGs), 22 transfer RNA (tRNA) genes, 2 ribosomal RNA (rRNA) genes, and a putative control region. Base composition is biased toward adenine and thymine (79.02% A+T) and A+T skew are slightly negative. Twelve of the 13 PCGs use typical ATN start codons. The exception is cytochrome oxidase 1 (cox1) that utilizes a CGA initiation codon. Nine PCGs have standard termination codon (TAA); others have incomplete stop codons, a single T or TA nucleotide. All the tRNA genes have the typical clover-leaf secondary structure, except for trnS(AGN), in which dihydrouridine (DHU) arm fails to form a stable stem-loop structure. The A+T-rich region (293 bp) contains a typical Lepidopter motifs âATAGAâ followed by a 17 bp poly-T stretch, and a microsatellite-like (AT)13 repeat. Codon usage analysis revealed that Asn, Ile, Leu2, Lys, Tyr and Phe were the most frequently used amino acids, while Cys was the least utilized. Phylogenetic analysis suggested that among sequenced lepidopteran mitochondrial genomes, Orthaga olivacea Warre was most closely related to Hypsopygia regina, and confirmed that Orthaga olivacea Warre belongs to the Pyralidae family."

Twenty-three cats with oral disease (8.2 Â± 2.2 years old; 4.9 Â± 0.9 kg) were included in a prospective, blinded, randomized clinical trial. Cats randomly received either Simbadol (1.8 mg/mL; 0.24 mg/kg, subcutaneously, every 24h: SG, n = 11) or Vetergesic (0.3 mg/mL; 0.02 mg/kg, intramuscularly, every 8h: VG, n = 12) throughout the study. They were admitted at day 0, underwent oral examination/radiographs/treatment under general anesthesia (buprenorphine-propofol-isoflurane-meloxicam-local anesthetic blocks) at day 1 and discharged at day 4. Sedation and pain were scored using the dynamic interactive visual analog scale (day 1) and the Glasgow Composite Measure Pain Scale-Feline (CMPS-F; up to postoperative 8 hours at day 1, 8 am, 4 pm and midnight at days 2 and 3, and 8 am at day 4), respectively. Rescue analgesia was administered with hydromorphone (0.05 mg/kg intravenously on day 1 or 0.1 mg/kg intramuscularly after day 2) when CMPS-F â¥ 5. Resentment defined as any type of escape behavior associated with aversion to drug administration was recorded. Sedation and pain scores, the prevalence of rescue analgesia and resentment during drug administration were analyzed using linear mixed models and Fisherâs exact test, respectively (p < 0.05). Pain and sedation scores were not significantly different between groups. Sedation scores were significantly higher up to postoperative 2 hours in both groups. Pain scores in SG and VG were significantly higher up to postoperative 8 hours and 8 am of day 2, respectively, than baseline. Prevalence of rescue analgesia and resentment were not significantly different between groups (SG: 27.3%, VG: 33.3% and SG: 0%, VG: 25%, respectively). Simbadol produced similar analgesic effects to Vetergesic without resentment during drug administration."
https://openalex.org/W3010253417,"We tested a feminist social-ecological model to understand community influences on daughtersâ experience of female genital mutilation/cutting (FGMC) in Egypt, where over 90% of women ages 15â49 are cut. FGMC has potential adverse effects on demographic and health outcomes and has been defined as a human-rights violation. However, an integrated multilevel-level framework is lacking. We theorized that a more favorable community-level gender system, including stronger gender norms opposing FGMC and expanded extra-familial opportunities for women in the village or neighborhood, would be associated with a daughterâs lower risk of FGMC and would strengthen the negative association of a motherâs opposition to FGMC with her daughterâs risk of cutting. Using a national sample of 14,171 mother-daughter dyads from the 2014 Egypt Demographic and Health Survey, we estimated multilevel discrete-time hazard models to test these relationships. Community gender norms opposing FGMC had significant direct, negative associations with the hazard that a daughter was cut, but womenâs opportunities outside the family did not. Maternal opposition to FGMC was negatively associated with cutting a daughter, and these associations were stronger where community opposition to FGMC and opportunities for women were greater. Results provided good support for a gender-systems framework of the multilevel influences on FGMC. Integrated, multilevel interventions that address gender norms about FGMC and structural opportunities for women in the community, as well as beliefs about the practice among the mothers of at-risk daughters, may be needed for sustainable declines in the practice."
https://openalex.org/W3010579076,"Skeletal muscles control posture, mobility and strength, and influence whole-body metabolism. Muscles are built of different types of myofibers, each having specific metabolic, molecular, and contractile properties. Fiber classification is, therefore, regarded the key for understanding muscle biology, (patho-) physiology. The expression of three myosin heavy chain (MyHC) isoforms, MyHC-1, MyHC-2A, and MyHC-2X, marks myofibers in humans. Typically, myofiber classification is performed by an eye-based histological analysis. This classical approach is insufficient to capture complex fiber classes, expressing more than one MyHC-isoform. We, therefore, developed a methodological procedure for high-throughput characterization of myofibers on the basis of multiple isoforms. The mean fluorescence intensity of the three most abundant MyHC isoforms was measured per myofiber in muscle biopsies of 56 healthy elderly adults, and myofiber classes were identified using computational biology tools. Unsupervised clustering revealed the existence of six distinct myofiber clusters. A comparison with the visual assessment of myofibers using the same images showed that some of these myofiber clusters could not be detected or were frequently misclassified. The presence of these six clusters was reinforced by RNA expressions levels of sarcomeric genes. In addition, one of the clusters, expressing all three MyHC isoforms, correlated with histological measures of muscle health. To conclude, this methodological procedure enables deep characterization of the complex muscle heterogeneity. This study opens opportunities to further investigate myofiber composition in comparative studies."
https://openalex.org/W3009053278,"Early diagnosis along with new drugs targeted to cancer receptors and immunocheckpoints have improved breast cancer survival. However, full remission remains elusive for metastatic breast cancer due to dose-limiting toxicities of heavily used, highly potent drug combinations such as gemcitabine and paclitaxel. Therefore, novel strategies that lower the effective dose and improve safety margins could enhance the effect of these drug combinations. To this end, we developed and evaluated a novel drug combination of gemcitabine and paclitaxel (GT). Leveraging a simple and scalable drug-combination nanoparticle platform (DcNP), we successfully prepared an injectable GT combination in DcNP (GT DcNP). Compared to a Cremophor EL/ethanol assisted drug suspension in buffer (CrEL), GT DcNP exhibits about 56-fold and 8.6-fold increases in plasma drug exposure (area under the curve, AUC) and apparent half-life of gemcitabine respectively, and a 2.9-fold increase of AUC for paclitaxel. Using 4T1 as a syngeneic model for breast cancer metastasis, we found that a single GT (20/2 mg/kg) dose in DcNP nearly eliminated colonization in the lungs. This effect was not achievable by a CrEL drug combination at a 5-fold higher dose (i.e., 100/10 mg/kg GT). A dose-response study indicates that GT DcNP provided a therapeutic index of ~15.8. Collectively, these data suggest that GT DcNP could be effective against advancing metastatic breast cancer with a margin of safety. As the DcNP formulation is intentionally designed to be simple, scalable, and long-acting, it may be suitable for clinical development to find effective treatment against metastatic breast cancer."

Following premature birth, the effects of routine neonatal care (e.g. oxygen support and mechanical ventilation) on the biological properties of lung endogenous mesenchymal stromal cells is (L-MSCs) is poorly understood. New Zealand white preterm rabbits were randomized into the following groups: (i) sacrificed at birth (Fetal), (ii) spontaneously breathing with 50% O2 for 4 hours (SB), or (iii) mechanical ventilation with 50% O2 for 4h (MV). At time of necropsy, L-MSCs were isolated, characterized, and compared. L-MSCs isolated from the MV group had decreased differentiation capacity, ability to form stem cell colonies, and expressed less vascular endothelial growth factor mRNA. Compared to Fetal L-MSCs, 98 and 458 genes were differentially expressed in the L-MSCs derived from the SB and MV groups, respectively. Gene ontology analysis revealed these genes were involved in key regulatory processes including cell cycle, cell division, and angiogenesis. Furthermore, the L-MSCs from the SB and MV groups had smaller mitochondria, nuclear changes, and distended endoplasmic reticula. Short-term hyperoxia/mechanical ventilation after birth alters the biological properties of L-MSCs and stimulates genomic changes that may impact their reparative potential."
https://openalex.org/W3010485740,"Low nephron number results in an increased risk of developing hypertension and chronic kidney disease. Intrauterine growth restriction is associated with a nephron deficit in humans, and is commonly caused by placental insufficiency, which results in fetal hypoxia. The underlying mechanisms by which hypoxia impacts kidney development are poorly understood. microRNA-210 is the most consistently induced microRNA in hypoxia and is known to promote cell survival in a hypoxic environment. In this study, the role of microRNA-210 in kidney development was evaluated using a global microRNA-210 knockout mouse. A male-specific 35% nephron deficit in microRNA-210 knockout mice was observed. Wnt/Î²-catenin signaling, a pathway crucial for nephron differentiation, was misregulated in male kidneys with increased expression of the canonical Wnt target lymphoid enhancer binding factor 1. This coincided with increased expression of caspase-8-associated protein 2, a known microRNA-210 target and apoptosis signal transducer. Together, these data are consistent with a sex-specific requirement for microRNA-210 in kidney development."
https://openalex.org/W3010034129,"Objectives To test the feasibility of a randomized controlled study design comparing epidural analgesia (EDA) with continuous wound infiltration (CWI) in respect to postoperative complications and mobility to design a future multicentre randomized controlled trial. Design, setting, participants CWI has been developed to address drawbacks of EDA. Previous studies have established the equivalent analgesic potential of CWI compared to EDA. This is a single centre, non-blinded pilot randomized controlled trial at a tertiary surgical centre. Patients undergoing elective non-colorectal surgery via a midline laparotomy were randomized to EDA or CWI. Endpoints included recruitment, feasibility of assessing postoperative mobility with a pedometer and morbidity. No primary endpoint was defined and all analyses were explorative. Interventions CWI with local anaesthetics (experimental group) vs. thoracic EDA (control). Results Of 846 patients screened within 14 months, 71 were randomized and 62 (31 per group) included in the intention-to-treat analysis. Mobility was assessed in 44 of 62 patients and revealed no differences within the first 3 postoperative days. Overall morbidity did not differ between the two groups (measured via the comprehensive complication index). Median pain scores at rest were comparable between the two groups, while EDA was superior in pain treatment during movement on the first, but not on the second and third postoperative day. Duration of preoperative induction of anaesthesia was shorter with CWI than with EDA. Of 17 serious adverse events, 3 were potentially related to EDA, while none was related to CWI. Conclusion This trial confirmed the feasibility of a randomized trial design to compare CWI and EDA regarding morbidity. Improvements in the education and training of team members are necessary to improve recruitment. Trial registration DRKS00008023."
https://openalex.org/W3010084624,"Cassava (Manihot esculenta Crantz) is an important food security crop in many parts of the developing world. The cropâs high yield potential and multitude of usesâboth for nutrition and processingârender cassava a promising driver for the development of rural value chains. It is traditionally propagated from stem cuttings of up to 30 cm in length, giving a multiplication rate as low as 1:10. Propagating cassava traditionally is very inefficient, which leads to challenges in the production and distribution of quality planting material and improved cultivars, greatly limiting the impact of investments in crop breeding. The work described in the present study aimed to develop a seed treatment approach to facilitate the use of shorter seed pieces, increasing the multiplication rate of cassava and thus making the cropâs seed systems more efficient. After several tests, formulation was identified, consisting of thiamethoxam 21 g ha-1, mefenoxam 1.0 g ha-1, fludioxonil 1.3 g ha-1, thiabendazole 7.5 g ha-1 and Latex 2% as a binder. Plant growing from seed pieces treated with this formulation displayed increased crop establishment and early crop vigor, leading to an improved productivity throughout a full growing cycle. This allowed to reduce the cassava seed piece size to 8 cm with no negative effects on germination and crop establishment, leading to yields comparable to those from untreated 16 cm pieces. This, in turn, will allow to increase the multiplication ratio of cassava by a factor of up to 3. Notably, this was possible under regular field conditions and independently of any specialised treatment facilities. Compared with existing seed production protocols, the increased multiplication rates allowed for efficiency gains of between 1 to 1.9 years compared to conventional five-year cycles. We believe that the technology described here holds considerable promise for developing more reliable and remunerative delivery channels for quality cassava planting material and improved genetics."

This study examines how young Africans from five epidemiologically and socio-culturally diverse countries (Swaziland, Kenya, Nigeria, Burkina Faso and Senegal) made sense of the evolving prevention of sexual transmission of HIV between 1997 and 2014. It uses a distinctive data source: 1,343 creative narratives submitted to HIV-themed scriptwriting competitions by young people aged 10-24. The study triangulates between analysis of quantifiable characteristics of the narratives, thematic qualitative analysis, and narrative-based approaches. Over time, HIV prevention themes become less prominent. Condoms are represented less often from 2008, though representations become more favourable. Biomedical prevention is all but absent through 2014. While prevention strategies may be described as effective in narratorial commentary, they are rarely depicted as preventing HIV, but are evoked instead in moralistic cautionary tales or represented as ineffective. Over time, an increasing proportion of protagonists are female. One in five narratives acknowledge structural drivers of HIV, but these are generally either disempowering or condemn characters for failing to prevent HIV in the face of often overwhelming structural challenges. In the context of combination prevention, there is a need to disseminate an empowering cultural narrative that models successful use of HIV prevention strategies despite structural constraints and avoids blaming and stigma."

The current study aimed to identify the effects of Lenke 1 thoracic AIS on the balance control during level walking in terms of the inclination angles (IA) of the center of mass (COM) relative to the center of pressure (COP), the rate of change of IA (RCIA), and the jerk index of IA. The association between the Cobb angle, IA and RCIA was also evaluated.Sixteen adolescents with AIS (age: 14.0Â±1.8 years, height: 154.8Â±4.7 cm, mass: 42.0Â±7.5 kg) and sixteen healthy controls (age: 14.4Â±2.0 years, height: 158.4Â±6.2 cm, body mass: 48.6Â±8.9 kg) performed level walking in a gait laboratory. The kinematic and ground reaction force data were measured for both concave-side and convex-side limb cycles, and used to calculate the IA and RCIA, the jerk index of IA, and the temporal-spatial parameters. Correlations between the Cobb angle, IA and RCIA were quantified using Pearson's correlation coefficients (r).The patients showed less smooth COM-COP motion with increased jerk index of IA in the sagittal plane during single limb support (SLS) of the concave-limb (p = 0.05) and in the frontal plane during double limb support (DLS) (p < 0.05). The patients also showed significantly increased posterior RCIA on both the concave and convex side during initial (p = 0.04, p = 0.03) and terminal (p = 0.04, p = 0.03) DLS when compared to healthy controls. In the frontal plane, the patients walking on the concave-side limb showed decreased IA over SLS (p = 0.01), and at contralateral toe-off (p<0.01) and contralateral heel-strike (p = 0.02), but increased mean IA magnitude over terminal DLS (p = 0.01). The frontal IA at contralateral toe-off and SLS for AIS-A showed a moderate to strong correlation with Cobb angles (r = -0.46 and -0.61), and the sagittal RCIA over the initial DLS for AIS-A also showed a significant, strong correlation with Cobb angles (r = -0.50).The patients with Lenke 1 thoracic scoliosis in the current study showed altered and jerkier COM-COP control during level walking when compared to healthy controls. During DLS, the patients increased the posterior RCIA in the sagittal plane with increased IA jerk index in the frontal plane for both the concave- and the convex-side limb, indicating their difficulty in maintaining a smooth transfer of the body weight. During SLS of the concave-side limb, the patients adopted a conservative COM-COP control strategy, as indicated by a decreased IA in the frontal plane, but showed a jerky COM-COP control in the sagittal plane. The COM-COP control of the patients was associated with the severity of the spinal deformity. The current results suggest that this patient group should be monitored for signs of an increased risk of loss of balance during weight transfer on the concave-side limb."
https://openalex.org/W3010377972,"The rapid and reliable diagnostics of highly pathogenic bacteria under restricted field conditions poses one of the major challenges to medical biodefense, especially since false positive or false negative reports might have far-reaching consequences. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) has the potential to represent a powerful microscopy-based addition to the existing molecular-based diagnostic toolbox. In this study, we developed a set of FISH-probes for the fast, matrix independent and simultaneous detection of thirteen highly pathogenic bacteria in different environmental and clinical sample matrices. Furthermore, we substituted formamide, a routinely used chemical that is toxic and volatile, by non-toxic urea. This will facilitate the application of FISH under resource limited field laboratory conditions. We demonstrate that hybridizations performed with urea show the same specificity and comparable signal intensities for the FISH-probes used in this study. To further simplify the use of FISH in the field, we lyophilized the reagents needed for FISH. The signal intensities obtained with these lyophilized reagents are comparable to freshly prepared reagents even after storage for a month at room temperature. Finally, we show that by the use of non-toxic lyophilized field (NOTIFy)-FISH, specific detection of microorganisms with simple and easily transportable equipment is possible in the field."
https://openalex.org/W3009138081,"Conversion of vacuum fluctuations into real particles was first predicted by L. Parker considering an expanding universe, followed in S. Hawkingâs work on black hole radiation. Since their experimental observation is challenging, analogue systems have gained attention in the verification of this concept. Here we propose an experimental set-up consisting of two adjacent piezoelectric semiconducting layers, one of them carrying dynamic quantum dots (DQDs), and the other being p-doped with an attached gate on top, which introduces a space-dependent layer conductivity. The propagation of surface acoustic waves (SAWs) on the latter layer is governed by a wave equation with an effective metric. In the frame of the DQDs, this space- and time-dependent metric possesses a sonic horizon for SAWs and resembles that of a two dimensional non-rotating and uncharged black hole to some extent. The non-thermal steady state of the DQD spin indicates particle creation in form of piezophonons."
https://openalex.org/W3010047507,"Background The drawback of the delta-shaped gastroduodenostomy (DSG) in totally laparoscopic distal gastrectomy (TLDG) is the presence of intraoperative duodenal injury and postoperative anastomotic stenosis, which can occur due to a relatively short duodenal bulb diameter. Materials and methods From June 2013 to June 2019, 35 patients with gastric cancer underwent TLDG with a modified DSG consisting of linear stapling and single-layer hand suturing in our institution. All anastomotic procedures were performed by the right hand of the operator positioned between the patientâs legs. Linear stapling of the posterior walls of the remnant stomach and duodenum without creating a gap was performed using a 45-mm linear stapler, considering the prevention of intraoperative duodenal injury. The stapler entry hole was closed using a single-layer full-thickness hand suturing technique with knotted sutures and a knotless barbed suture. We described the clinical data and outcomes in the present retrospective patient series. Results No intraoperative duodenal injury occurred in any of the 35 patients. The median staple length at linear stapling of the posterior walls of the remnant stomach and duodenum was 41.7 Â± 4.2 (30â45) mm, and 2 patients (5.7%) had a staple length of 30 mm. There were no incidences of postoperative anastomotic stenosis. Conclusions We suggest that a modified DSG consisting of linear stapling and single-layer hand suturing performed by an operator positioned between the patientâs legs can be one option for B-â  reconstruction following TLDG because it can aid in preventing both intraoperative duodenal injury and postoperative anastomotic stenosis."
https://openalex.org/W3010223894,"Background Women-held maternity documents are well established for enabling continuity of maternity care worldwide, with the World Health Organisation (WHO) recommending their use in effective decision-making. We aimed to assess the presence, content and completeness of women-held maternity documents at admission to hospitals in The Gambia, and investigate barriers and facilitators to their completion. Methods We interviewed 250 women on maternity wards of all 3 Banjul hospitals and conducted content analysis of documentation brought by women on admission for their completeness against WHO referrals criteria. Logistic regression models were used to estimate the odds of the minimum criteria being met. Two focus groups and 21 semi-structured interviews (8 doctors, 8 midwives and 5 nurses) were conducted with healthcare practitioners to explore barriers and facilitators to documented clinical information availability on admission. Findings Of the women admitted, all but 10/250 (4%) brought either a maternity card or a structured referral sheet. Of all forms of documentation, women most frequently brought the government-issued maternity card (235/250, 94%); 16% of cards had all 9 minimum criteria completed. Of the 79 referred women, 60% carried standardised referral forms. Only 30% of 97 high-risk women had risk-status recorded. Women were less likely to have documents complete if they were illiterate, had not attended three maternity appointments, or lived more than one hour from hospital. During qualitative interviews, three themes were identified: women as agents for transporting information and documents (e.g. remembering to bring maternity cards); role of individual healthcare professionalsâ actions (e.g. legibility of handwriting); system and organisational culture (e.g. standardised referral guidelines). Conclusion Women rarely forgot their maternity card, but documents brought at admission were frequently incomplete. This is a missed opportunity to enhance handover and quality of care, especially for high-risk women. National guidelines were recognised by providers as needed for good document keeping and would enhance the women-held maternity documentsâ contribution to improving both safety and continuity of care."
https://openalex.org/W3010527420,"To assess the 5-year change in abnormal fundus autofluorescence (FAF) patterns and retinal sensitivity in the fellow eye of Japanese patients with unilateral exudative age-related macular degeneration (AMD).Patients with unilateral exudative AMD who developed abnormal FAF in the fellow eyes were enrolled. FAF imaging and microperimetry were performed at baseline and follow-ups. FAF findings were classified into 8 patterns based on the International Fundus Autofluorescence Classification Group to assess retinal sensitivity. Forty-five points covering the central 12 degrees on microperimetry were superimposed onto the FAF images. Each point was classified depending on the distance from the abnormal FAF. ""Close"" was defined as the portion within 1 degree from the border of any abnormal FAF, and ""Distant"" was defined as the portion over 1 degree from the border of abnormal FAF. To investigate the association between the retinal sensitivity and distance from the abnormal FAF, hierarchical linear mixed-effect models were used with the distance, time and time squared from baseline (months), and angle (degrees) as fixed effects. Differences among patients, eyes, and test point locations were considered successively nested random effects.We studied 66 fellow eyes with abnormal FAF. Twenty-seven eyes were followed-up during the 5 years. In the 13 of 27 eyes (48%), the abnormal FAF patterns had changed during the 5 years. We found retinal sensitivity was associated significantly with the distance from the abnormal FAF (""Distant"": p<0.001, time2 from baseline: p<0.001, angle: p<0.001). The mean retinal sensitivity of the ""Close"" tended to deteriorate after the third year and eventually showed the similar sensitivity as the portion within the abnormal FAF.FAF patterns can change about half during the 5 years and the retinal sensitivity near abnormal FAF tends to deteriorate after the third year."
https://openalex.org/W2769700139,"Organizations that develop or operate complex engineering systems are plagued by systems engineering failures like schedule overruns, budget exceedances, and project cancellations. Unfortunately, there is not much actionable guidance on why these failures happen or how to prevent them. Our approach contains two novel aspects. First, we argue that system accidents and other failures in systems engineering are manifestations of similar underlying problems. Therefore, we can leverage the literature on accident causation and the many publicly available accident investigation reports to better understand how and why failures in systems engineering occur, and to identify ways of preventing them. Second, to address the lack of concrete guidance on identifying and preventing incipient failures, we provide specific examples of each type of failure cause and of the recommendations for preventing these causes. We analyzed a set of 30 accidents and 33 project failures, spanning a range of industries, and found 23 different failure causes, most of which appear in both accidents and other project failures, suggesting that accidents and project failures do happen in similar was. We also identified 16 different recommended remedial actions. We link these causes and recommendations in a cause-recommendation network, and associate over 900 specific examples of how these causes manifested in failures, and over 600 specific examples of the associated recommended remedial actions, with each cause or recommendation."
