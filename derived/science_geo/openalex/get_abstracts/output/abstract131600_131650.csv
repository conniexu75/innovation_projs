https://openalex.org/W2072744580,"The mechanism by which telomeres prevent end-to-end fusion has remained elusive. Here, we show that the human telomeric protein TRF2 plays a key role in the protective activity of telomeres. A dominant negative allele of TRF2 induced end-to-end chromosome fusions detectable in metaphase and anaphase cells. Telomeric DNA persisted at the fusions, demonstrating that TTAGGG repeats per se are not sufficient for telomere integrity. Molecular analysis suggested that the fusions represented ligation of telomeres that have lost their single-stranded G-tails. Therefore, TRF2 may protect chromosome ends by maintaining the correct structure at telomere termini. In addition, expression of mutant forms of TRF2 induced a growth arrest with characteristics of senescence. The results raise the possibility that chromosome end fusions and senescence in primary human cells may be caused by loss by TRF2 from shortened telomeres."
https://openalex.org/W2076710572,"We have always underestimated cells. Undoubtedly we still do today. But at least we are no longer as naive as we were when I was a graduate student in the 1960s. Then, most of us viewed cells as containing a giant set of second-order reactions: molecules A and B were thought to diffuse freely, randomly colliding with each other to produce molecule AB—and likewise for the many other molecules that interact with each other inside a cell. This seemed reasonable because, as we had learned from studying physical chemistry, motions at the scale of molecules are incredibly rapid. Consider an enzyme, for example. If its substrate molecule is present at a concentration of 0.5 mM, which is only one substrate molecule for every 105 water molecules, the enzyme's active site will randomly collide with about 500,000 molecules of substrate per second. And a typical globular protein will be spinning to and fro, turning about various axes at rates corresponding to a million rotations per second. But, as it turns out, we can walk and we can talk because the chemistry that makes life possible is much more elaborate and sophisticated than anything we students had ever considered. Proteins make up most of the dry mass of a cell. But instead of a cell dominated by randomly colliding individual protein molecules, we now know that nearly every major process in a cell is carried out by assemblies of 10 or more protein molecules. And, as it carries out its biological functions, each of these protein assemblies interacts with several other large complexes of proteins. Indeed, the entire cell can be viewed as a factory that contains an elaborate network of interlocking assembly lines, each of which is composed of a set of large protein machines. Consider, as an example, the cell cycle–dependent degradation of specific proteins that helps to drive a cell through mitosis. First a large complex of about 10 proteins, the anaphase-promoting complex (APC), selects out a specific protein for polyubiquitination (11King R Deshaies R Peters J Kirschner M How proteolysis drives the cell cycle.Science. 1996; 274: 1652-1659Crossref PubMed Scopus (1099) Google Scholar, 22Zachariae W Shin T Galova M Obermaier B Nasmyth K Identification of subunits of the anaphase-promoting complex of Saccharomyces cerevisiae.Science. 1996; 274: 1201-1204Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar); this protein is then targeted to the proteasome's 19S cap complex formed from about 20 different subunits; and the cap complex then transfers the targeted protein into the barrel of the large 20S proteasome itself, where it is finally converted to small peptides (5Baumeister W Walz J Zühl F Seemüller E The proteasome paradigm of a self-compartmentalizing protease.Cell. 1998; 92 (this issue): 367-380Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1273) Google Scholar [this issue). Why do we call the large protein assemblies that underlie cell function protein machines? Precisely because, like the machines invented by humans to deal efficiently with the macroscopic world, these protein assemblies contain highly coordinated moving parts. Within each protein assembly, intermolecular collisions are not only restricted to a small set of possibilities, but reaction C depends on reaction B, which in turn depends on reaction A—just as it would in a machine of our common experience (1Alberts B.M The DNA enzymology of protein machines.Cold Spring Harb. Symp. Quant. Biol. 1984; 49: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Underlying this highly organized activity are ordered conformational changes in one or more proteins driven by nucleoside triphosphate hydrolysis (or by other sources of energy, such as an ion gradient). Because the conformational changes driven in this way dissipate free energy, they generally proceed only in one direction. An earlier brief review emphasized how the directionality imparted by nucleoside triphosphate hydrolyses allows allosteric proteins to function in three different ways: as motor proteins that move in a polarized fashion along a filament or a nucleic acid strand; as proofreading devices or “clocks” that increase the fidelity of biological reactions by screening out poorly matched partners; and as assembly factors that catalyze the formation of protein complexes and are then recycled. (See Figure 1 in Alberts and Miake-Lye, 1992.) Since the time of that review, the number of protein assemblies that are recognized to employ such devices has substantially increased. In particular, the nearly ubiquitous use of energy-driven conformational changes to promote the local assembly of protein complexes, thereby creating a high degree of order in the cell, has become universally recognized. A simple generic diagram of such a process is presented in Figure 1. We have also come to realize that protein assemblies can be enormously complex. Consider for example the spliceosome. Composed of 5 small nuclear RNAs (snRNAs) and more than 50 proteins, this machine is thought to catalyze an ordered sequence of more than 10 RNA rearrangements as it removes an intron from an RNA transcript. As cogently described in this issue of Cell by 18Staley J.P Guthrie C Mechanical devices of the spliceosome motors, clocks, springs, and things.Cell. 1998; 92 (this issue): 315-326Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (896) Google Scholar, these steps involve at least eight RNA-dependent ATPase proteins and one GTPase, each of which is presumed to drive an ordered conformational change in the spliceosome and/or in its bound RNA molecule. As the example of the spliceosome should make clear, the cartoons thus far used to depict protein machines (e.g.Figure 1) vastly underestimate the sophistication of many of these remarkable devices. Given the ubiquity of protein machines in biology, we should be seriously attempting a comparative analysis of all of the known machines, with the aim of classifying them into types and deriving some general principles for future analyses. Some of the methodologies that have been derived by the engineers who analyze the machines of our common experience are likely to be relevant. For example, modern machines comprised of subsystems from different “domains” (i.e., mechanical, electrical, fluid, thermal) are often analyzed by an energy-based approach. Here a mathematical description of the machine is achieved by considering certain scalar functions that represent the system energy (i.e., kinetic and potential energy) and the work done by external forces. The laws of nature are then enforced by application of first principles to arrive at the so-called equations of motion (13Meirovitch L Methods of Analytical Dynamics. McGraw-Hill, New York1970Google Scholar, 16Ogata K System Dynamics. 2. Prentice-Hall, Englewood Cliffs, NJ1992Google Scholar). At the heart of such methods is the simplification and idealization of a real world machine as a composition of discrete elements. Engineers recognize certain fundamental behaviors in nature and then create an idealized element to represent each of those behaviors. Most simply, they classify elements as those that store kinetic energy, those that store potential energy, and those that dissipate energy. Any particular part of a machine might be modeled as consisting of one or more of these basic constituent elements. It seems reasonable to expect that different, but analogous approaches could profitably be applied to the protein machines that underlie the workings of all living things. It is not hard to see why protein machines are advantageous to cells. A mere glance at the collection of articles in this issue of Cell should suffice to prove the point. Compare for example the speed and elegance of the machine that simultaneously replicates both strands of the DNA double helix (6Baker T.A Bell S.P Polymerases and the replisome machines within machines.Cell. 1998; 92 (this issue): 295-305Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar [this issue) with what could be achieved if each of the individual components (DNA polymerase, DNA helicase, DNA primase, sliding clamp) acted instead in an uncoordinated manner. But the devil is in the details. What, for example, has been the advantage to the higher eukaryotic cell of adding additional polypeptide chains to the DNA replication apparatus, while retaining the same basic functions as found in the bacterium E. coli and its viruses (19Stillman B Smart machines at the DNA replication fork.Cell. 1994; 78: 725-728Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar)? And to what extent has the design of present-day protein machines been constrained by the long evolutionary pathway through which the function evolved, rather than being optimally engineered for the function at hand? At least for protein synthesis on the ribosome, the evolutionary history—dating back to an “RNA world”—is thought to have played a predominant role (8Green R Noller H Ribosomes and translation.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 679-716Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar, 21Wilson K.S Noller H.F Molecular movement inside the translational engine.Cell. 1998; 92 (this issue): 337-349Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar [this issue). And when one examines the other protein assemblies known to operate in cells—such as the various complexes of RNA polymerase and its sets of accessory factors that catalyze transcription in eukaryotes—one is sometimes reminded of the many irrational complexities of a Rube Goldberg cartoon (20Tjian R The biochemistry of transcription in eukaryotes a paradigm for multisubunit regulatory complexes.Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B. 1996; 351: 491-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 9Greenblatt J RNA polymerase II holoenzyme and transcriptional regulation.Curr. Opin. Cell. Biol. 1997; 9: 310-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 10Kadonaga J.T Eukaryotic transcription an interlaced network of transcription factors and chromatin-modifying machines.Cell. 1998; 92 (this issue): 307-313Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (462) Google Scholar [this issue). But perhaps this is only because we still understand so little of what the cell needs to accomplish with each of its various protein assemblies. About ten years ago, I was struck by the speed and the elegance of the protein machine that replicates DNA (3Alberts B.M Prokaryotic DNA replication mechanisms.Phil. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B. 1987; 317: 395-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) in comparison to what I viewed then as a slow and ponderous ribosome. This led to a speculation: those present-day reactions that evolved early in the history of life on the earth (like protein synthesis) should have originated in a cell dominated by RNA catalysis; these reactions might therefore remain relatively inefficient, due to constraints traceable to their evolutionary history. In contrast, those present-day reactions that evolved later (like DNA replication), in a cell dominated by protein catalysis, could be expected to be much more efficient (2Alberts B.M The function of the hereditary materials biological catalyses reflect the cell's evolutionary history.Amer. Zool. 1986; 26: 781-796Google Scholar). The complexity of the spliceosome might support this view, if one assumes that RNA splicing was a very early event that predated the existence of cells rich in proteins. However, the argument has certainly been weakened by the unexpected complexity of DNA transcription processes in eukaryotes, which I would have predicted to mimic DNA replication in their elegance and their simplicity. Answers to puzzling questions like these will require that we acquire a much more complete understanding of the many protein assemblies that carry out the important functions of the cell. This brings me to the central point of this introduction. A careful reading of this volume should convince everyone of at least two things: first, that we have made incredible progress in deciphering what we know today about protein assemblies; and second, that we still have an enormous amount more to learn. Thus, for example, our current drawings of the structure of the nuclear pore complex seem reminiscent of the sketches of houses that are drawn by young children, and they probably bear a similar relation to the real thing. Determining the structure of this fascinating cellular component, approximately 25 times larger than a ribosome (17Ohno M Fornerod M Mattaj I.W Nucleocytoplasmic transport the last 200 nanometers.Cell. 1998; 92 (this issue): 327-336Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar [this issue), remains a daunting challenge that will probably require methodologies not yet developed. And what new techniques will allow us to follow the kinetics and structure of each of the intermediates involved in the many fascinating transport reactions that occur deep within the lipid bilayer membrane? (See 12Matlack K.E.S Mothes W Rapoport T.A Protein translocation tunnel vision.Cell. 1998; 92 (this issue): 381-390Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar [this issue]). Even when we know the detailed structure of a protein assembly at an atomic level, as we do for the chaparonin GroEL-GroES, much will remain to be studied. As the article by 7Bukau B Horwich A.L The Hsp70 and Hsp60 chaperone machines.Cell. 1998; 92 (this issue): 351-366Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2346) Google Scholar makes clear, any real understanding of the function of a protein machine will require not only its resting structure in atomic detail, but also a knowledge of the kinetics and energetics of each of its reaction intermediates. New techniques will need to be developed to facilitate such research. But, as always in biology, it will be crucial to define the key parameters that need to be determined, since much more can be measured than should be measured. Outstanding prototype investigations that are clearly explained and reexplained in review article and textbooks can help both to shape this exciting new field and to recruit young scientists to it. Many of my generation fear that the molecular biology revolution that we have just been through has made biological research look deceptively easy. Perhaps as a result, we generally find that even our most talented graduate students lack the background in the physical sciences that they are likely to need to decipher the detailed chemistry of protein machines. These individuals have taken the standard undergraduate courses in physics and chemistry, but they have generally not seen these subjects as central to carrying out research in molecular biology. True, in an era dominated by gene cloning, many of today's most distinguished scientists have been enormously productive without any quantitative skills. But the students of today will carry out most of their research in a post-genome-sequencing era, when most of the advances in molecular biology will come from successfully dissecting complicated in vitro systems composed of pure components (e.g., proteins, nucleic acids, and/or membranes). Here a deep understanding of the key constraints on the system posed by thermodynamic and kinetic factors, as well as an ability to use new developments in chemistry and physics as appropriate tools, will often be vital for success. From my point of view, the education that we are offering today to young biologists in our colleges and universities is seriously in need of a major rethinking. The good news is that biology has become an increasingly popular major for our undergraduates, and there is no reason why we cannot excite all of them about science—whether budding researchers, premedical students, or those aiming for other professions. But the bad news is that far too many of our introductory courses are tedious surveys of an entire field—as if, for example, one could hope to gain any real understanding of all of biology in a single year. And in an era where there is a uniform push for exposing K-12 students to “science as inquiry,” as emphasized in the National Science Education Standards (14National Research Council The National Science Education Standards. National Academy Press, Washington, DC1996Google Scholar, 15National Research Council Science Teaching Reconsidered. National Academy Press, Washington, DC1997Google Scholar), it remains hard to find any evidence of inquiry in most of our introductory college science laboratories. Most important for the future of our field, the departmental structures at most universities seem to have thus far prevented any major rethinking of what preparation in mathematics, what preparation in physics, and what preparation in chemistry is most appropriate for either the research biologists or the medical doctors who will be working 10 or 20 years from now. The result is a major mismatch between what today's students who are interested in biology should be learning and the actual course offerings that are available to them. It is largely for this reason, I believe, that so many talented young biologists feel that mathematics, chemistry, and physics are of minor importance to their careers. It is my hope that some of the young scientists who read this issue of Cell will come to the realization that much of the great future in biology lies in gaining a detailed understanding of the inner workings of the cell's many marvelous protein machines. With this perspective, students may well be motivated to gain the background in the quantitative sciences that they will need to explore this subject successfully. But they will need the faculty in our colleges and universities to lead them. I am indebted to Jonathan Alberts for his explanations of how engineers analyze machines, Mei Lie Wong for preparation of the figure, and Teresa Donovan for manuscript preparation."
https://openalex.org/W2039651834,Recent experiments with chaotic electronic circuits have shown the possibility of communication with chaos. The experimental demonstration of chaotic communication with an optical system is described. An erbium-doped fiber ring laser (EDFRL) was used to produce chaotic light with a wavelength of 1.53 micrometers. A small 10-megahertz message was embedded in the larger chaotic carrier and transmitted to a receiver system where the message was recovered from the chaos. Chaotic optical waveforms can thus be used to communicate masked information at high bandwidths.
https://openalex.org/W2150345297,"The T cell receptor (TCR) inherently has dual specificity. T cells must recognize self-antigens in the thymus during maturation and then discriminate between foreign pathogens in the periphery. A molecular basis for this cross-reactivity is elucidated by the crystal structure of the alloreactive 2C TCR bound to self peptide–major histocompatibility complex (pMHC) antigen H-2K b –dEV8 refined against anisotropic 3.0 angstrom resolution x-ray data. The interface between peptide and TCR exhibits extremely poor shape complementarity, and the TCR β chain complementarity-determining region 3 (CDR3) has minimal interaction with the dEV8 peptide. Large conformational changes in three of the TCR CDR loops are induced upon binding, providing a mechanism of structural plasticity to accommodate a variety of different peptide antigens. Extensive TCR interaction with the pMHC α helices suggests a generalized orientation that is mediated by the V α domain of the TCR and rationalizes how TCRs can effectively “scan” different peptides bound within a large, low-affinity MHC structural framework for those that provide the slight additional kinetic stabilization required for signaling."
https://openalex.org/W2042419096,"Angiogenesis depends on both cell adhesion and proteolytic mechanisms. In fact, matrix metalloproteinase 2 (MMP-2) and integrin alphavbeta3 are functionally associated on the surface of angiogenic blood vessels. A fragment of MMP-2, which comprises the C-terminal hemopexin-like domain, termed PEX, prevents this enzyme binding to alphavbeta3 and blocks cell surface collagenolytic activity. PEX blocks MMP-2 activity on the chick chorioallantoic membrane where it disrupts angiogenesis and tumor growth. Importantly, a naturally occurring form of PEX can be detected in vivo in conjunction with alphavbeta3 expression in tumors and during developmental retinal neovascularization. Levels of PEX in these vascularized tissues suggest that it interacts with endothelial cell alphavbeta3 where it serves as a natural inhibitor of MMP-2 activity, thereby regulating the invasive behavior of new blood vessels."

Study of the variants of an antigenic epitope of Plasmodium falciparum that induces a cytotoxic T cell response supports this view. In African children with malaria, the variants present are influenced by the presence of a human leukocyte antigen (HLA) type that restricts the immune response to this epitope. The distribution of parasite variants may be further influenced by the ability of cohabiting parasite strains to facilitate each other's survival by down-regulating cellular immune responses, using altered peptide ligand antagonism."
https://openalex.org/W1554121416,"Specific immunotherapy is an efficient treatment for patients suffering from type I allergy. The mechanisms underlying successful immunotherapy are assumed to operate at the level of T helper cells, leading to a modulation of the immune response to allergens. During immunotherapy, increasing doses of allergens are given on a regular basis, and the beneficial effects for the patient depend on the concentration of allergen used. On the other hand, the risk of IgE-mediated anaphylactic side effects also increase with the amount of allergen applied per injection. Therefore, we have proposed the use of hypoallergenic (low IgE binding activity) forms of allergens for immunotherapy. We evaluated by site-directed mutagenesis the contributions of individual amino acid residues/positions for IgE binding to Bet v 1, the major allergen of birch pollen. We found that IgE binding to Bet v 1 depended on at least six amino acid residues/positions. Immunoblot analyses and inhibition experiments showed that the multiple-point Bet v 1 mutant exhibited extremely low reactivity with serum IgE from birch pollen-allergic patients. In vivo (skin prick) tests showed that the potency of the multiple-point mutant to induce typical urticarial type I reactions in pollen-allergic patients was significantly lower than for wild-type Bet v 1. Proliferation assays of allergen-specific T cell clones demonstrated that these six amino acid exchanges in the Bet v 1 sequence did not influence T cell recognition. Thus, the Bet v 1 six-point mutant displayed significantly reduced IgE binding activity, but conserved T cell activating capacity, which is necessary for immunomodulation. The approach described here may be generally applied to produce allergen variants to be used in a safe therapy form of immediate-type allergies."

APC7 contains multiple copies of the tetratrico peptide repeat, similar to CDC16, CDC23, and CDC27. Whereas APC4 and APC5 share no similarity to proteins of known function, APC2 contains a region that is similar to a sequence in cullins, a family of proteins implicated in the ubiquitination of G 1 phase cyclins and cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors.

The Sec7 domain is an elongated, all-helical protein with a distinctive hydrophobic groove that is phylogenetically conserved. Structure-based mutagenesis identifies the groove and an adjacent conserved loop as the ARF-interacting surface.

Intranigral infusion of freshly prepared GSNO (0–16.8 nmol, i.n.) prevented iron-induced (4.2 nmol, i.n.) oxidative stress and nigral injury, reflected by a decrease in striatal dopamine levels. This neuroprotective effect of GSNO was verified by ex vivo imaging of brain dopamine uptake sites using 125I-labeled RTI-55. In addition, in vitro data indicate that GSNO concentration-dependently inhibited iron-evoked hydroxyl radical generation and brain lipid peroxidation. In this iron-induced oxidant stress model, GSNO was approximately 100-fold more potent than the antioxidant glutathione (GSH).

That is, mismatch repair seems to contribute to somatic hypermutation rather than stifling it. It is suggested that at immunoglobulin loci in hypermutable B cells, mismatched base pairs are “corrected” according to the newly synthesized DNA strand, thereby fixing incipient mutations instead of eliminating them."

The trade winds induce equatorial upwelling and zonal advection of cold water that further intensify the trade winds, and an exchange of water occurs between the tropical and extratropical Pacific in which the poleward surface flow is balanced by equatorward flow of cold water in the thermocline.

https://openalex.org/W1998083240,"Annexin II tetramer (AIIt) is a major Ca<sup>2+</sup>-binding protein of endothelial cells which has been shown to exist on both the intracellular and extracellular surfaces of the plasma membrane. In this report, we demonstrate that AIIt stimulates the activation of plasminogen by facilitating the tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA)-dependent conversion of plasminogen to plasmin. Fluid-phase AIIt stimulated the rate of activation of [Glu]plasminogen about 341-fold compared with an approximate 6-fold stimulation by annexin II. AIIt bound to [Glu]plasminogen(S741C-fluorescein) with a <i>K</i><sub>d</sub> of 1.26 ± 0.04 μm (mean ± S.D.,<i>n</i> = 3) and this interaction resulted in a large conformational change in [Glu]plasminogen.

AIIt also stimulated the t-PA-dependent activation of [Lys]plasminogen about 28-fold. Furthermore, other annexins such as annexin I, V, or VI did not produce comparable activation of t-PA-dependent conversion of [Glu]plasminogen to plasmin. The stimulation of the activation of [Glu]plasminogen by AIIt was Ca<sup>2+</sup>-independent and inhibited by ε-aminocaproic acid. AIIt bound to human 293 cells potentiated t-PA-dependent plasminogen activation. AIIt that was bound to phospholipid vesicles or heparin also stimulated the activation of [Glu]plasminogen 5- or 11-fold, respectively. Furthermore, immunofluorescence labeling of nonpermeabilized HUVEC revealed a punctated distribution of AIIt subunits on the cell surface. These results therefore identify AIIt as a potent <i>in vitro</i>activator of plasminogen."

A scanning superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) microscope was used to image interlayer Josephson vortices in Tl 2 Ba 2 CuO 6+ δ and to obtain a direct measure of the interlayer tunneling in a high–transition temperature superconductor with a single copper oxide plane per unit cell. The measured interlayer penetration depth, λ c , is ∼20 micrometers, about 20 times the penetration depth required by the interlayer tunneling model."
https://openalex.org/W1901844586,"Premature labor, fetal demise, and fetal growth restriction are accompanied by indices of inflammation or infection of the uteroplacental unit. To understand whether these events are causally related, we established an animal model of fetal demise and growth restriction and evaluated the potential utility of the anti-inflammatory cytokine interleukin-10 (IL-10). We administered low-dose endotoxin (lipopolysaccharide, or LPS, 100 microg/kg, i.p.) to third trimester rats (gestational days 14-20). Control rats received normal saline. A third group received IL-10 (100 microg/kg; s.c.) concomitantly with LPS for 7 prenatal days. Cytokine gene expression (IL-10 and TNF-alpha) was evaluated by RT-PCR and tissue levels (TNF-alpha) were determined by ELISA. Apoptosis was evaluated by TdT-mediated dUTP nick end labeling immunohistochemistry, and nitric oxide (NO) levels were quantified by microelectrode electrochemical detection in explants in culture media. LPS exposure resulted in 43% fetal demise and reduced the size of the surviving fetuses. Placental weight was not altered by LPS. IL-10 attenuated the LPS-induced fetal death rate (to 22%) and growth restriction (P<0.05). In normal rats, IL-10 did not affect fetus size or the incidence of resorptions, although placental size was marginally smaller. Increased uterine TNF-alpha content and NO release and apoptosis of uterine epithelia and muscularis were hallmarks of the LPS model. All were normalized by IL-10. IL-10 may represent a new therapeutic option for the treatment of a variety of perinatal complications. Benefit may result from the suppression of TNF-alpha- and NO-mediated cell death."

Chlorine-36 data from the Greenland Ice Core Project (GRIP) ice core agree well with a production rate calculation based on a paleomagnetic reconstruction for the past 100,000 years over both long- and short-term variations. A chlorine-36 peak at 38,000 years ago previously found in the beryllium-10 record from the Vostok ice core can be explained by a period of low geomagnetic field intensity."

Experiments and thermodynamic analyses show that crystalline carbonic acid sublimates without decomposition. Free-energy considerations based on highly accurate molecular quantum mechanics, in combination with vapor pressures resulting from experimental sublimation rates, suggest that in the gas phase, a monomer and dimer of carbonic acid are in equilibrium, comparable to that of formic acid. Gaseous carbonic acid could be present in comets, on Mars and outer solar system bodies, in interstellar icy grains, and in Earth's upper atmosphere."
https://openalex.org/W2029999438,"In the interlayer theory of high-temperature superconductivity, the interlayer pair tunneling energy (similar to the Josephson or Lawrence-Doniach energy) is the motivation for superconductivity. This connection requires two experimentally verifiable identities: the coherent normal-state conductance must be smaller than the “Josephson” coupling energy, and the Josephson coupling energy must be equal to the condensation energy of the superconductor. The first condition is well satisfied in the only case that is relevant, (La,Sr) 2 CuO 4 , but the second condition has been questioned. It is satisfied for all dopings in (La,Sr) 2 CuO 4 and also in optimally doped Hg(Ba) 2 CuO 5 , which was measured recently, but seems to be strongly violated in measurements on single crystals of Tl 2 Ba 2 CuO 6 ."

https://openalex.org/W2050054840,"Activation of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) plays an important role in the mitogenic response of many cell types. Recently, two serine/threonine kinases Akt and p70S6k have been identified as physiological targets of PI3K. Observations that expression of activated forms of Akt led to the activation of p70S6k implied Akt might mediate mitogenic signaling through activation of p70S6k. To clarify the relationship between signaling through these two kinases, we have examined their regulation by various mitogenic stimuli. In this study we have focused on the role of calcium in the regulation of each kinase in Balb/c-3T3 fibroblasts. Depletion of intracellular calcium stores by EGTA pretreatment has no effect on growth factor-induced Akt activation but completely abolishes p70S6k stimulation. Increase of intracellular calcium induced by ionomycin or thapsigargin results in a full activation of p70S6k, whereas little or no activation of Akt is observed. Furthermore, although PI3K in anti-phosphotyrosine immunoprecipitates is only very weakly activated by ionomycin, the calcium-induced stimulation of p70S6k is completely inhibited by the specific PI3K inhibitor wortmannin. We conclude Akt and p70S6k lie on separate signaling pathways. Activation of signaling to Akt is insufficient for the activation of p70S6k, which can be achieved independently of Akt. p70S6k requires a separate calcium-dependent and wortmannin-sensitive process that is likely to be independent of type IA PI3K family members.

Due to this mode of activation, PI3K IA can be assayed in anti-phosphotyrosine immunoprecipitates, distinct from the other known PI3K family members types IB, II, and III (3Domin J. Waterfield M.J. FEBS Lett. 1997; 410: 91-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). Activation of PI3K IA has been implicated in the control of cell growth by observations that mutants of the PDGF receptor that cannot bind PI3K are defective in mitogenic signaling and that transformation defective mutants of various oncogenes fail to activate PI3K (1Kapeller R.

However, until recently little was known as to how the mitogenic signal is transmitted downstream of PI3K. This situation changed with the identification of the two serine/threonine kinases, p70S6k (6Chung J. Grammar T.C. Lemon K.P. Kazlauskas A. Blenis J.

PDGF receptor mutants unable to bind PI3K IA fail to activate both p70S6k(6Chung J. Grammar T.C. Lemon K.P. Kazlauskas A. Blenis J.

In addition, the activation of both kinases by growth factors is inhibited by two different inhibitors of PI3K IA, wortmannin and LY294002 (7Burgering B.M.T. Coffer P.

This connection is further supported by the findings that both p70S6k and Akt are activated following co-transfection with constitutively active PI3K IA(14Reif K. Burgering B.M.T. Cantrell D.A. J.

Michaeli T. Backer J.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 248-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). In addition, Akt is directly activated in vitro by phosphatidylinositol 3,4-bisphosphate, a phospholipid product of PI3K IA, and this activation is dependent on a functional pleckstrin homology domain in Akt (18Klippel A. Kavanaugh W.M. Pot D. Williams L.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 338-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar, 19Franke T.F. Kaplan D.R. Cantley L.C. Toker A. Science. 1997; 275: 665-668Crossref PubMed Scopus (1305) Google Scholar). In addition to lying downstream of PI3K IA, both Akt and p70S6k are activated by a similar range of mitogens (EGF, PDGF, fibroblast growth factor, nerve growth factor, insulin, and insulin-like growth factor-1) and phosphatase inhibitors (vanadate and okadaic acid), implying a close connection between the signaling pathways to the two kinases (7Burgering B.M.T.

Nature. 1994; 371: 426-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). Indeed, Akt may mediate mitogenic signaling by activation of p70S6k, since p70S6k is stimulated by active mutants of Akt in co-transfection assays (7Burgering B.M.T. Coffer P. Nature. 1995; 376: 599-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (1880) Google Scholar, 14Reif K. Burgering B.M.T. Cantrell D.A. J. Biol.

Chem. 1996; 271: 21920-21926Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar). However, there is some indication of differences in their signaling pathways. A kinase inactive mutant of Akt, presumed to act as a dominant negative, failed to inhibit p70S6k stimulation (7Burgering B.M.T. Coffer P. Nature. 1995; 376: 599-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (1880) Google Scholar), and Akt does not phosphorylate p70S6k in vitro. Whereas inappropriate activation of Akt leads to cellular transformation (22Ahmed N.N. Franke T.F. Bellacosa A. Datta K. Gonzalez-Portal M. Taguchi J.R. Testa J.R. Tsichlis P.N. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 1957-1963PubMed Google Scholar), constitutively active forms of p70S6k are not transforming (23Mahalingam M. Templeton D.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 405-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Moreover, it has recently been shown that Akt but not p70S6k mediates PI3K IA-dependent survival of cerebellar neurons and Rat-1 fibroblasts (24Dudek H. Datta S.R. Franke T.F. Birnbaum M.J. Yao R. Cooper G.M. Segal R.A. Kaplan D.R. Greenberg M.E. Science. 1997; 275: 661-664Crossref PubMed Scopus (2218) Google Scholar, 25Kauffmann-Zeh A. Rodriguez-Viciana P. Ulrich E. Gilbert C. Coffer P.

Biol. 1997; 17: 1595-1606Crossref PubMed Scopus (965) Google Scholar). To clarify the connection between signaling through Akt and p70S6k, we have examined their regulation by other mitogen-stimulated pathways. One obvious candidate for regulating PI3K IA-initiated pathways is the PLCγ/DAG/1,4,5-inositol triphosphate pathway. Both PI3K IA and PLCγ are crucial for growth factor-induced mitogenesis (6Chung J. Grammar T.C. Lemon K.P. Kazlauskas A. Blenis J. Nature. 1994; 370: 71-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (657) Google Scholar, 27Valius M. Kazlauskas A. Cell. 1993; 73: 321-334Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (570) Google Scholar). In addition, cross-talk between the two is suggested by experiments showing that the lipid products of PI3K IA activate the novel PKC isoforms (28Ettinger S.L. Lauener R.W. Duronio V. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14514-14518Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 29Akimoto K. Takahashi R. Moriya S. Nishioka N. Takayanagi J. Kimura K. Fukui Y. Osada S. Mizuno K.

Ohno S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 151-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). PI3K IA-independent activation of p70S6k via the conventional PKC (cPKC) has been reported (6Chung J. Grammar T.C. Lemon K.P. Kazlauskas A. Blenis J. Nature. 1994; 370: 71-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (657) Google Scholar). Mitogenic stimulation of PLCγ leads to a rapid and transient increase of intracellular calcium through the second messenger inositol triphosphate (31Berridge M.J. Nature. 1993; 361: 315-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (6174) Google Scholar), as well as the generation of diacyl glycerol (DAG) with subsequent activation of PKC (32Nishizuka Y. Science. 1992; 258: 607-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (4230) Google Scholar). Although the role of this calcium “spike” in mitogenesis is poorly characterized (31Berridge M.J. Nature. 1993; 361: 315-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (6174) Google Scholar, 33Wahl M. Gruenstein E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 4: 293-302Crossref Scopus (38) Google Scholar,34Short A.D. Bian J. Ghosh T.K. Waldron R.T. Rybak S.L. Gill D.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 4986-4990Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar), increases in calcium and DAG result in activation of both the conventional and novel PKCs. Although simultaneous activation of PI3K IA and increase of intracellular calcium, via the PLCγ/DAG/1,4,5-inositol triphosphate pathway, is observed in many cell types, little attention has been given to the interactions between both systems. In this study, we examine the role of calcium in the regulation of the PI3K IA/Akt/p70S6k pathway(s) in Balb/c-3T3 fibroblasts to clarify the interconnection between signaling through these kinases. We show that Akt activation is independent of calcium, whereas p70S6k stimulation is totally dependent on calcium. Increases of intracellular calcium levels give little or no activation of Akt and PI3K IA but fully activate p70S6k, and this calcium-induced stimulation is completely blocked by low levels of wortmannin. Thus, the activation of the signaling pathway to Akt is insufficient for activation of p70S6k, which also requires a separate, calcium-dependent process. Furthermore, stimulation of p70S6k by calcium is likely to involve a new wortmannin-sensitive pathway, independent of PI3K IA. Balb/c-3T3 fibroblasts were grown at 37 °C in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. Confluent cells were made quiescent by culturing for 24 h in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing no fetal calf serum. Serum-starved cells were rinsed twice with a Hepes buffer solution containing 120 mm NaCl and 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4. Cells were then treated at 37 °C with various stimuli diluted in Hepes buffer: 5 nm EGF (Auspep) for 5 min, 50 ng/ml PDGF (Auspep) for 5 min, 1 μm ionomycin for 5 min, 5 μmthapsigargin for 5 min, 0.1 mm pervanadate prepared with 0.2 mm H2O2 (35Posner B.I.

Alternatively, cells were pretreated for 20 min at 37 °C in Hepes buffer containing 2 mm EGTA, 2 mm BAPTA, 100 nmwortmannin, 5 nm rapamycin, 5 μm the PKC inhibitor Ro-31-8220, 5 μm the inactive analogue Ro-31-6045, or 5 μm calphostin C before stimulation. In some experiments, the cells were pretreated for 24 h with 5 μm PMA. The controls were carried out by incubating the cells for the corresponding period in Hepes buffer containing dimethyl sulfoxide (Me2SO) instead of the agent. Following stimulation, the cells were rinsed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and lysed in a buffer containing 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 120 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm EDTA, 50 mm NaF, 40 mmβ-glycerophosphate, 0.1 mm sodium vanadate, 1 mm benzamidine, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Cell extracts were collected with a plastic scraper, homogenized, and cleared by centrifugation at 4 °C for 20 min at 12,000 × g. Protein concentration was measured by the method of Bradford (Bio-Rad), with bovine serum albumin as standard. Aliquots of the supernatant were frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −70 °C. Akt was immunoprecipitated by incubating 200 μg of protein/assay of cell extract with protein A-Sepharose pre-coupled to an antibody directed to the C-terminal 16 residues of Akt (36Jones P.F.

The beads were then washed twice at 4 °C with the lysis buffer and once with a kinase assay buffer containing 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 1 mm benzamidine, and 0.5 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Akt kinase activity was assayed using the Crosstide as substrate (37Cross D.A.E. Alessi D.R. Cohen P. Andjelkovic M. Hemmings B.A. Nature. 1995; 378: 785-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (4375) Google Scholar) by incubating the immunoprecipitated Akt for 20 min at 30 °C on a shaking plate in 25 μl of kinase assay buffer containing 100 μm Crosstide, 1 μm protein kinase inhibitor peptide, 10 mmMgCl2, and 50 μm ATP (plus 0.25 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP). Following a brief centrifugation, the reaction was terminated by spotting the supernatant on P81 phosphocellulose paper. Unincorporated [γ-32P]ATP was eliminated by three 5-min washes in 75 mm orthophosphoric acid, and phosphorylated Crosstide bound to the paper was counted. Akt kinase assays were conducted in duplicate. The results are expressed in units of Akt activity per mg of protein lysate. One unit of activity results in the transfer of 1 pmol of 32Pi into Crosstide per min under the assay condition listed above. p70S6k activity was assayed as described previously (38Lane H.A. Thomas G. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 200: 269-291Google Scholar) using 40 S ribosome as substrate. The results are expressed in units of p70S6k activity per mg of protein lysate. One unit of activity results in the transfer of 1 pmol of32Pi into S6 protein per min. For measurement of PI3K activity, cell lysates (500 μg of protein) were incubated with 2 μg of a mixture of anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies (PY-7E1, PY-1B2, and PY20, Zymed Laboratories) overnight at 4 °C, under constant mixing. The PI3K assays were then performed essentially as described previously (4Whitman M. Kaplan D.R. Shaffhausen B. Cantley L. Roberts T.M.

The samples were incubated for 20 min at 25 °C, and the reactions were stopped by the addition of 100 μl of 1 mHCl. Phospholipids were extracted and separated for 2 h by thin layer chromatography in a chloroform/methanol/glacial acetic acid/H2O (46/41/5/8) developing solvent prepared freshly. The 32P-phospholipids were quantified on a PhosphorImager using ImageQuant software (Molecular Dynamics). Cell lysates were boiled in Laemmli sample buffer for 3 min. Cell lysates, containing 10 μg of total protein for the determination of Akt and 40 μg for p70S6k, were subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) on 10% slab gels, and proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. Membranes were blocked for 30 min in PBS containing 0.1% Tween 20 (PBS-T) and 5% (w/v) dry skim milk powder and incubated overnight with anti-p70S6k (39Lane H.A. Fernandez A. Lamb N.J.C. Thomas G.

The membranes were then washed with PBS-T and incubated for 2 h with an anti-rabbit secondary antibody conjugated to horseradish peroxidase. Bound antibodies were detected with the enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) system (Amersham Corp.). Serum-starved Balb/c-3T3 cells were harvested by trypsinization and suspended at a density of 106 cells/ml in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 0.1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin. The cells were loaded with 2 μm fura-2/AM for 30 min at 37 °C in the same medium. Cells were washed once and resuspended in Hepes buffer at the same density. For fluorimetric measurements, 3 × 106fura-2-loaded cells were placed in a cuvette, and fluorescence was monitored using a dual excitation wavelength spectrofluorimeter (SPEX Industries Inc., Edison, NJ). Cells were excited with light alternating between 340 and 380 nm, and fluorescence emitted was measured at 505 nm. The results of excitation (F340 and F380) were averaged over 1-s intervals. Autofluorescence at each wavelength, which represented less than 10% of the signal from loaded cells, was subtracted before calculation of the ratio F340/F380. This ratio is proportional to change in intracellular calcium (40Grynkiewicz G. Poenie M. Tsien R.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3440-3450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), and the results are expressed as change in the ratio from base line. To study the relationship between the activation of Akt and p70S6k, we have examined their relative regulation by EGF in Balb/c-3T3 fibroblasts. Western blot analysis of Akt and p70S6krevealed the characteristic bandshifting associated with the activation of these kinases by treatment of the cells with EGF (Fig. 1 A). When the cells were incubated with sufficient EGTA to deplete the intracellular calcium stores, the EGF-induced electrophoretic mobility decrease of Akt was still observed, whereas p70S6k remained in its basal state (Fig. 1 A). Measurement of intracellular calcium levels confirmed that the intracellular calcium stores were almost totally depleted after treatment with EGTA under the conditions stated above (Table I). EGF treatment did not increase intracellular calcium levels significantly, indicating a basal level of calcium is required for the activation of p70S6k. Relative calcium levels were measured as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Pretreatment with the PI3K inhibitor wortmannin inhibited the bandshifting of both kinases, whereas the immunosuppressant rapamycin specifically inhibited p70S6k (Fig. 1 A).Table IEffect of EGF, PDGF, and thapsigargin in the presence or absence of EGTA, BAPTA, or wortmannin on relative intracellular calcium levelsPretreatmentControlEGFPDGFThapsigarginNo+0.06 ± 0.05+1.00 ± 0.20+1.17 ± 0.47EGTA−0.80 ± 0.13−0.74 ± 0.11−0.56 ± 0.11−0.66 ± 0.25BAPTA−0.83 ± 0.05−0.83 ± 0.03−0.54 ± 0.08−0.64 ± 0.07Wortmannin0.00 ± 0.010.00 ± 0.01+1.01 ± 0.07+1.31 ± 0.18 Open table in a new tab These results indicate a differential dependence of Akt and p70S6k on calcium for activation and were confirmed by direct kinase assays. The EGF-induced activation of Akt was independent of calcium (Fig. 1 B), whereas the activation of p70S6k by EGF was dependent on the presence of calcium (Fig. 1 C). To characterize further the calcium requirement for Akt and p70S6k activation, we tested two other stimuli known to potently activate these kinases, PDGF and the tyrosine phosphatase inhibitor pervanadate. Unlike EGF, PDGF induced substantial increases in intracellular calcium levels, and these levels remained below base line if the cells were pretreated with either EGTA or BAPTA (Table I). Pervanadate and PDGF markedly decreased the electrophoretic mobility of Akt and p70S6k (Fig. 2 A). p70S6kbandshifting was abolished by EGTA treatment, whereas Akt was unaffected. These results were quantified by direct kinase assays (Fig. 2 , B and C). EGF, PDGF, and pervanadate induced a 5- to 6-fold activation of Akt activity and an 8- to 9-fold increase of p70S6k activity. The stimulation of Akt activity by all agents was not affected by calcium chelation (Fig. 2 B), whereas this treatment completely inhibited p70S6kactivation by PDGF (Fig. 2 C). The stimulation of p70S6k activity by pervanadate was only partially blocked (43% inhibition) following EGTA preincubation (Fig. 2 C), indicating the existence of a calcium-independent pathway capable of stimulating p70S6k. Preincubation with 100 nm wortmannin inhibited the pervanadate-induced stimulation of p70S6k activity by 85%, whereas it completely blocked the activation by EGF and PDGF. A combination of wortmannin and EGTA did not further inhibit p70S6k activation by pervanadate (results not shown). Thus, the wortmannin-independent pathway that can stimulate p70S6k is also calcium-independent. To determine the effects of an increase of intracellular calcium on the activity of both kinases, ionomycin and thapsigargin, a specific inhibitor of the endoplasmic reticulum calcium-ATPases was used (41Thastrup O. Cullen P.J. Drobak B.K. Hanley M.R. Dawson A.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 2466-2470Crossref PubMed Scopus (3001) Google Scholar). Ionomycin and thapsigargin induced similar and substantial increases in intracellular calcium levels, and EGTA or BAPTA pretreatment reduced calcium levels below base line in the presence of thapsigargin (Table I). Incubation in the presence of these agents induced little or no activation of Akt, although it fully activated p70S6k (6–7-fold increase). Preincubation with EGTA abolished the effects of ionomycin and thapsigargin (Fig. 3, A and B). Simultaneous treatment with ionomycin and EGF did not lead to any increase of Akt and p70S6k activation induced by EGF alone (results not shown). Time course and dose-response analysis showed no effect on Akt activity and indicated that the concentration of ionomycin and thapsigargin and the duration of stimulation used were optimal for p70S6k stimulation (results not shown). Thus, the activation of Akt is not required for the calcium stimulation of p70S6k activity in Balb/c-3T3 fibroblasts. Due to its pivotal role in the regulation of Akt and p70S6k in response to growth factors, the involvement of PI3K in the stimulation of both kinases by calcium was examined. Cells were stimulated with ionomycin or thapsigargin following 20 min preincubation with 100 nm wortmannin, a dose that gives specific inhibition of PI3K (42Wymann M.P. Bulgarelli-Leva G. Zvelebil M.J. Pirola L. Vanhaesebroeck B. Waterfield M.D. Panayotou G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1722-1733Crossref PubMed Scopus (635) Google Scholar). This treatment resulted in Akt and p70S6k activities below control levels (Table II), indicating that PI3K is absolutely required for the stimulation by calcium. The measurement of intracellular calcium levels in fura-2/AM-loaded cells showed that the preincubation with wortmannin had no effect on the increase of calcium induced by PDGF or thapsigargin (Table I).Table IIThe effect of pretreatment with wortmannin on activation of p70S6k by ionomycinAktp70S6kunits/mgControl0.094 ± 0.0097.7 ± 0.78Thapsigargin0.146 ± 0.02265.0 ± 7.50Thapsigargin + wortmannin0.079 ± 0.0076.4 ± 0.30 Open table in a new tab To characterize further the involvement of PI3K in the calcium-induced activation of p70S6k, the role of a calcium in the regulation of PI3K activity in anti-phosphotyrosine immunoprecipitates was examined. Ionomycin treatment resulted in weak activation of PI3K (2-fold), approximately 60-fold less than that induced by EGF treatment. Preincubation with EGTA resulted in a 20% inhibition of EGF-induced PI3K activation (Fig. 4). These results indicate the possible existence of a PI3K/Akt-independent, calcium-dependent pathway leading to the activation of p70S6k. However, because the calcium-induced stimulation of p70S6k is completely inhibited by low doses of wortmannin (Table II), it is possible that other PI3K isoforms, not detected in the anti-phosphotyrosine immunoprecipitation, are involved. To examine the differential effects of calcium on Akt and p70S6k activities, we focused on the calcium-regulated PKC (cPKC). Cells were incubated in the presence of PMA for 24 h, to down-regulate PKC, and then stimulated with various mitogens. PKC down-regulation had no effect on Akt activation by any of the stimuli tested (results not shown), whereas a partial inhibition of the stimulation of p70S6k activity induced by pervanadate (40%), EGF (41%), PDGF (47%), and ionomycin (45%) was observed (Fig. 5 A). Re-addition of PMA to cells in which PKC was down-regulated gave no activation of p70S6k suggesting that the conditions used were sufficient to down-regulate PKC (Fig. 5 A). To characterize further the involvement of PKC in the Akt and p70S6k pathway, cells were exposed to 5 μm PMA for 10 min. As shown previously (7Burgering B.M.T. Coffer P. Nature. 1995; 376: 599-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (1880) Google Scholar, 9Franke T.F. Yang S. Chan T.O. Datta K. Kazlauskas A. Morrison D.K. Kaplan D.R. Tsichlis P.N.

Following EGTA exposure, the stimulation of p70S6k by PMA was inhibited by approximately 60%, although after pretreatment with wortmannin (100 nm) this inhibition was increased to 75% (Fig. 5 B). At more relevant PMA levels (100 nm), this inhibition was almost complete (90%, results not shown). Combination of EGTA and wortmannin completely inhibited the stimulation of p"

The genomic organization and promoter function for the entire transcription unit of CXCR4 were determined. The gene contains 2 exons of 103 and 1563 base pairs (bp) interrupted by a 2132-bp intron precisely between codons 5 and 6 of the coding sequences. A transcription start site was identified 88 bp upstream of the initiation codon, and a polyadenylate addition site was identified 22 bp 3′ to a polyadenylation signal. Transient expression assays defined a minimal promoter at positions −114 to +43 relative to the transcription start site. This region contains a TATA box, a nuclear respiratory factor-1 (NRF-1) site, and two GC boxes. Specific factor binding to the NRF-1 site and GC boxes were demonstrated by gel mobility shifts and DNase I footprinting. Site-directed mutagenesis showed that the NRF-1 site is crucial for promoter activity providing the first evidence for the regulation of a signal transduction gene by NRF-1.

The sequence of the gene has a very high GC content; the coding sequences are 50.3% GC, and the intron and 0.95 kilobase pairs 5′ to the transcription start site are 56.9 and 53.1% GC, respectively, which is higher than 99% of human genes (36Zoubak S. Clay O. Bernardi G. Gene (Amst.). 1999; 174: 95-102Crossref Scopus (159) Google Scholar). The biologic significance of this observation is uncertain. However, the practical implication of this finding is that large portions of the gene are quite difficult to amplify by the polymerase chain reaction, which will make attempts to perform high through-put studies to look for genotypic polymorphisms in cohorts of subjects more difficult.Polymorphisms that result in mutant chemokine receptor proteins have been identified for CCR5 (37Liu R.

The finding of substantial polymorphisms in the coding sequence for CXCR4 may be less likely than for the other chemokine receptors. CXCR4 mRNA is widely expressed in a variety of hematopoietic and non-hematopoietic tissues, including brain, heart, kidney, lung, and liver (41Shirozu M. Nakano T. Inazawa J. Tashiro K. Tada H. Shinohara T. Honjo T. Genomics. 1995; 28: 495-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (533) Google Scholar, 42Tashiro K. Tada H. Heilker R. Shirozu M. Nakano T. Honjo T. Science. 1993; 261: 600-603Crossref PubMed Scopus (635) Google Scholar), which is a markedly larger distribution than the other identified chemokine receptors. There is so far only one identified ligand, SDF-1, which produces a lethal mutation when knocked out in mice (43Nagasawa T. Hirota S. Tachibana K. Takakura N. Nishikawa S. Kitamura Y. Yoshida N. Kikutani H. Kishimoto T. Nature. 1996; 382: 635-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (1994) Google Scholar), and bothCXCR4 and SDF-1 genes show high interspecies conservation (9Doranz B.J. Rucker J. Yi Y.

All of these findings argue for the criticality of a functional CXCR4 gene product, and against the likelihood of finding significant polymorphisms in human cohorts.The validity of our proposed genomic organization is supported by multiple lines of evidence. Primer extension analysis was performed in multiple cell lines and yielded a strong single nucleotide band with weaker bands for the adjacent nucleotides on either side, but no other significant start sites. This start site was predicted before the performance of these experiments by the Neural Network algorithm (26Reese, M. G., Harris, N. L., Eeckman, F. H., Proceedings of the Pacific Symposium on Biocomputing, Kona, Hawaii, Hunter, L., Klein, T., 1996, 74, 75, World Scientific Publishing Co. Pte. Ltd., Singapore.Google Scholar) and is further supported by the presence of nearby upstream elements including TATA and GC box elements. The intron-exon boundaries contain consensus splice donor and acceptor sequences, were predicted by Neural Network (25Brunak S. Engelbrecht J. Knudsen S. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 220: 49-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (623) Google Scholar) and maintain the open reading frame as predicted by the cDNA sequences (24Loetscher M. Geiser T. O'Reilly T. Zwahlen R. Baggiolini M. Moser B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 232-237Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The polyadenylate addition site was quite precise when sequenced in multiple clones, occurs immediately downstream of a consensus polyadenylation signal, and agrees with previously published work (24Loetscher M. Geiser T. O'Reilly T. Zwahlen R. Baggiolini M. Moser B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 232-237Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The size of mRNA species predicted by sum of the two exons and a 100–200-base pair poly(A) tail agrees with that observed by Northern analysis (6Feng Y. Broder C. Kennedy P.E. Berger E.A. Science. 1996; 272: 872-877Crossref PubMed Scopus (3622) Google Scholar, 24Loetscher M. Geiser T. O'Reilly T. Zwahlen R. Baggiolini M. Moser B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 232-237Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).Analysis of the CXCR4 5′-flanking sequence showed the presence of several potential binding sites for known transcription factors. The importance of the two most proximal Sp1 sites, and to a much greater degree, the NRF-1 site in the basal promotion of theCXCR4 gene was shown by multiple, complementary experiments, including DNase I footprinting, transient transfection with promoter/CAT constructs, site-directed mutagenesis of the NRF-1 site, and mobility shift assays. The transient transfection experiments, deleting from both 5′ and 3′ ends of the 5′-flanking region, localized the critical basal promoter sequences between positions −114 to +43 relative to the transcription start site (sequence positions 836 and 992). Deletion or mutation of the sequences containing the NRF-1 site at positions −61 to −49 (sequence positions 889–901) essentially abolished CXCR4 promoter activity.NRF-1 is a nuclear encoded gene product that has been shown to be important for the transcriptional regulation of multiple mitochondrial genes involved in organelle biogenesis and cellular respiration (33Virbasius C.A. Virbasius J.V. Scarpulla R.C. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 2431-2445Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). Potential NRF-1 binding sites have also been identified in several genes important for cell maintenance, growth, and proliferation such as the genes for ornithine decarboxylase, 5-aminolevulinate synthase, bcl-2, and DNA polymerase-α, and signal transduction genes such as those for cyclophilin, calmodulin, and murine GM-CSF (33Virbasius C.A. Virbasius J.V. Scarpulla R.C. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 2431-2445Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). However, the functional significance of these observations is unclear. Following submission of this manuscript, Moriuchi and colleagues (45Moriuchi M. Moriuchi H. Turner W. Fauci A.S. J. Immunol. 1997; 159: 4322-4329PubMed Google Scholar) described the recovery of the proximal portion of the CXCR4 promoter reported here and also demonstrated the importance of NRF-1 forCXCR4 transcriptional regulation. These two reports represent the first demonstration of the role of NRF-1 in the expression of a signal transduction gene. Given the evidence for the importance of CXCR4 in cellular development and its presence on immune effector cells, it is easy to postulate that NRF-1 serves to coordinate an increase in a cell's metabolic capacity in response to inflammatory or proliferative signals, preparing the cell to migrate or divide. This increased level of cellular activation has been previously shown to be important for high level HIV-1 replication in target cells (46Zack J.A. Arrigo S.J. Weitsman S.R. Go A.S. Haislip A. Chen I.S. Cell. 1990; 61: 213-222Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1288) Google Scholar).Transient transfections done in several cell lines consistently showed a degradation of promoter activity when sequences between −668 and −191 were present in the construct, suggesting the presence of negative regulatory elements in this portion of the sequence. Precise mapping of this region to delineate these elements is now in progress. An inducible repressor element could conceivably be a target for the development of therapeutic agents; if CXCR4transcription could be blocked, entry of SI strains of HIV-1 into cells might be inhibited.Identification of two new co-receptors that also mediate HIV-1 and SIV entry, such as Bonzo (47Deng H. Unutmaz D. KewalRamani V.N. Littman D.R. Nature. 1997; 388: 296-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (598) Google Scholar, 48Alkhatib G. Liao F. Berger E.A. Farber J.M. Peden K.W.C.

Nature. 1997; 388: 230-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), underscores the growing complexity of HIV-1 viral entry into target cells. Elucidation of the regulatory mechanisms that govern the interplay of these co-receptors will be important to a fuller understanding of HIV disease.

It has been shown that the binding characteristics of one type of G protein-coupled receptor can be altered by the stimulation of another type of G protein-coupled receptor in crude membrane preparations (1Zoli M. Agnati L.F. Hedlund P. Li X.M. Ferré S. Fuxe K. Mol. Neurobiol. 1993; 7: 293-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Such intramembrane interactions have been postulated to represent direct interactions between the receptor molecules and/or to involve G proteins or other mobile molecules associated with the membrane (1Zoli M. Agnati L.F. Hedlund P. Li X.M. Ferré S. Fuxe K. Mol. Neurobiol. 1993; 7: 293-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). There is increasing evidence suggesting that antagonistic intramembrane interactions between specific subtypes of adenosine and dopamine receptors constitute an important integrative mechanism in the basal ganglia (2Ferré S. Fuxe K. von Euler G. Johansson B. Fredholm B.B. Neuroscience. 1992; 51: 501-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar, 3Ferré S. Fredholm B.B. Morelli M. Popoli P. Fuxe K. Trends Neurosci. 1997; 20: 482-487Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (722) Google Scholar). Adenosine A1 and A2A receptors antagonistically and specifically modulate the binding characteristics of dopamine D1 and D2 receptors, respectively (2Ferré S. Fuxe K. von Euler G. Johansson B.

In membrane preparations from rat striatum, the stimulation of A2A receptors decreases the affinity of D2receptors for agonists (4Ferré S. von Euler G. Johansson B. Fredholm B.B. Fuxe K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 88: 7238-7241Crossref Scopus (499) Google Scholar). On the other hand, the stimulation of A1 receptors was shown to decrease the proportion of D1 receptors in the high affinity state, without modifying the dissociation constants of high and low affinity D1agonist-binding sites (5Ferré S. Popoli P. Giménez-Llort L. Finnman U.-B. Martı́nez E. Scotti de Carolis A. Fuxe K. Neuroreport. 1994; 6: 73-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Thus, the A1 receptor agonist had the same effect as that induced by the GTP analogue Gpp(NH)p. 1The abbreviations used are: Gpp(NH)p, guanyl-5′-yl imidodiphospate; DPCPX, 1,3-dipropyl-8-cyclopentylxanthine; PTX, pertussis toxin; CPA,N 6-cyclopentyladenosine; ANOVA, analysis of variance. It was hypothesized that A1 receptor stimulation might uncouple the striatal D1 receptor from the G protein (5Ferré S. Popoli P. Giménez-Llort L. Finnman U.-B. Martı́nez E. Scotti de Carolis A. Fuxe K. Neuroreport. 1994; 6: 73-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). There is evidence that the antagonistic A2A-D2 and A1-D1 intramembrane interactions are involved in the motor depressant effects of adenosine receptor agonists and the motor stimulant effects of adenosine receptor antagonists, such as caffeine (2Ferré S.

The same changes in the binding characteristics of striatal D2 receptors after A2A receptor stimulation have been obtained in membrane preparations from a mouse fibroblast cell line (Ltk−) stably cotransfected with the dog A2A receptor and human D2 (long-form) receptor cDNAs (6Dasgupta S.

In these transfection studies, it was also found that activation of adenylyl cyclase was not involved in the intramembrane A2A-D2 interaction (6Dasgupta S. Ferré S. Kull B. Hedlund P. Finnman U.-B. Ahlberg S. Arenas E. Fredholm B.B. Fuxe K. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1996; 316: 325-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Altogether, these results showed that stably cotransfected cell lines constitute a valuable model to study the mechanistic aspects involved in the intramembrane receptor-receptor interactions. In the present work, this methodology has been applied to study the antagonistic interaction between A1 and D1 receptors. The first aim of the study was to demonstrate the existence of an antagonistic A1-D1 intramembrane interaction in mammalian cells stably cotransfected with A1 receptor and D1 receptor cDNAs. The second aim was to demonstrate the existence of a functional antagonistic interaction between A1 and D1 receptors in the cotransfected cells by means of cAMP accumulation experiments. Finally, the third aim of the study was to find a functional significance of the antagonistic A1-D1 intramembrane interaction. Cells from the mouse fibroblast Ltk− cell line previously transfected with the human D1 receptor cDNA (7Liu Y.F. Civelli O. Zhou Q.-Y. Albert P.R. Mol. Endocrinol. 1992; 6: 1815-1824Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) were used. The expression vector pZEM-3 (8Uhler M.D. McKnight G.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 15202-15207Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) containing the full coding sequence of the human D1 receptor in front of mouse metallothionein promoter I had been cotransfected with the plasmid pRSV-neo, which confers resistance to neomycin and Geneticin (G418). Metallothionein promoter I allows transcriptional induction by including zinc sulfate in the cell culture (8Uhler M.D. McKnight G.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 15202-15207Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Nevertheless, a clone expressing a relatively high level of D1 receptor mRNA and protein was obtained (D1 cells) without zinc-mediated induction (7Liu Y.F. Civelli O. Zhou Q.-Y. Albert P.R. Mol.

The expression of the A1receptor was verified by Northern blot and radioligand binding techniques (see below), and a clone expressing similar levels of A1 and D1 antagonist-binding sites (A1D1 cells) was chosen for further experiments. A1D1 cells were cultured routinely at 37 °C with 5% CO2 in Dulbecco's minimal essential medium with 4.5 mg/ml glucose and 0.11 mg/ml sodium pyruvate supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mm glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 units/ml streptomycin, 200 μg/ml G418, and 300 μg/ml hygromycin in plastic Petri dishes. D1cells were cultured as described for A1D1cells, but without hygromycin. The splitting of cell cultures was performed by replacing the medium with a modified Puck's saline containing trypsin (0.5 mg/ml) and EDTA (0.2 mg/ml). The experiments were performed at a cell confluence of ∼80%. Isolation of RNA from the Ltk−cells was carried out according to the method of Chomcyznski and Sacchi (11Chomcyznski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63232) Google Scholar). For preparation of the Northern blots, 20 μg of total RNA/lane was denatured in a 2.1 m formaldehyde and 50% formamide solution by heating for 2 min at 95 °C, separated by electrophoresis on a 2.2 m formaldehyde and 1.0% agarose gel, and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. Blots were hybridized with32P-labeled adenosine A1 receptor cDNA by nick translation. Following hybridization, the membrane was washed and exposed to Kodak XAR-5 film with an intensifying screen at −70 °C. The optical density of the bands was measured by computer-assisted densitometric analysis (IBAS image analyzer). The D1 and A1D1 cells were lifted from Petri dishes with a cell scraper. Harvested cells were washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and centrifuged at 2000 rpm for 5 min at 4 °C. The cell pellet was sonicated (30 s) and resuspended in the incubation buffer containing adenosine deaminase (Boehringer Mannheim; 10 units/ml). The homogenate was centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C; the precipitated nucleic fraction was discarded; and the supernatant was incubated for 30 min at 37 °C (to activate adenosine deaminase and to remove endogenous adenosine) and centrifuged at 20,000 rpm for 40 min at 4 °C. The membrane pellet was then resuspended by sonication in the incubation buffer without adenosine deaminase (final protein concentration of ∼0.2 mg/ml). In the experiments with [3H]SCH 23390 (NEN Life Science Products), the incubation buffer was 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) containing 120 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 2 mmCaCl2, and 1 mm MgCl2. In the experiments with 1,3-[3H]dipropyl-8-cyclopentylxanthine ([3H]DPCPX; NEN Life Science Products), the incubation buffer was 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) containing 2 mm MgCl2. Experiments with pertussis toxin (PTX) were performed with A1D1cells exposed to PTX (200 ng/ml) for 4 h before membrane preparation for radioligand binding experiments or cAMP accumulation experiments. The effectiveness of PTX pretreatment and the consequent inactivation of Gi proteins were evaluated in membrane preparations by subsequent [32P]ADP-ribosylation in the presence of [32P]NAD and PTX (12Fredholm B.B. Proctor W. Van der Ploeg I. Dunwiddie T.V. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1989; 172: 249-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). PTX was preactivated in 50 mm 1,4-dithiothreitol for 1 h at 25 °C. The reaction mixture (100 μl) contained 0.5–1 mg/ml protein, 1 mm ATP, 10 mm thymidine, 250 μmGTP, 1 μm [32P]NAD (0.5–1 Ci/mmol), and 20 μg/ml PTX in a buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4). At the end of a 45-min incubation period at 30 °C, the reaction was stopped by adding 10 μl of 1% sodium deoxycholate followed by 12 μl of 4 m perchloric acid. The samples were kept on ice for 20 min and centrifuged for 5 min at 20,000 rpm. The pellet was neutralized with 1 m NaOH; 30 μl of Laemmli buffer was added; and the proteins were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis with 10% acrylamide. Autoradiography was performed by exposure of dried gels to Fuji RXNIF film for 2–4 days. Saturation experiments with the D1 receptor antagonist [3H]SCH 23390 were carried out with 10 concentrations (0.2–6.0 nm) of [3H]SCH 23390 (70.3 Ci/mmol) in the presence or absence of the A1 receptor agonistN 6-cyclopentyladenosine (CPA; 10 nm) by incubation for 15 min at 37 °C. Nonspecific binding is defined as the binding in the presence of 100 μm dopamine. Saturation experiments with the A1 receptor antagonist [3H]DPCPX were carried out with 10 concentrations (0.6–27.7 nm) of [3H]DPCPX (120.0 Ci/mmol) by incubation for 2 h at room temperature. Nonspecific binding is defined as that occurring in the presence of the adenosine A1 receptor agonistN 6-cyclohexyladenosine (40 μm). Competition experiments of dopamine (1 nm to 10 mm) versus the dopamine D1 antagonist [3H]SCH 23390 (∼2 nm) were performed by incubation for 15 min at 37 °C in the presence or absence of CPA or the nonhydrolyzable GTP analogue Gpp(NH)p. Competition experiments of CPA (10 pm to 10 μm) versus [3H]DPCPX (∼1 nm) were performed by incubation for 2 h at room temperature. The incubation was stopped by fast filtration through glass-fiber filters (GF/B, Whatman) by washing three times with 5 ml of 50 mm ice-cold Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) with an automatic cell harvester (Brandel). The radioactivity content of the filters was detected by liquid scintillation spectrometry. To avoid the variability of the binding parameters associated with the assay conditions, such as cell confluency (∼80%) and number of passages (up to 10), the same membrane preparation was used to study the effect of different drugs on the binding characteristics of dopamine D1 receptors, and each experiment was independently analyzed. Data from saturation experiments were analyzed by nonlinear regression analysis (GraphPad) for the determination of dissociation constants (KD) and the number of receptors (Bmax). Data from competition experiments were also analyzed by nonlinear regression analysis, and the fitting for either one or two binding sites was statistically compared (F test). For a two-binding site fit, the dissociation constants for the high (KH) and low affinity (KL) binding sites and for the proportion of binding sites in the high affinity state (RH) were determined. For a one-binding site fit, the concentration of agonist that displaced 50% of the labeled antagonist (IC50) was determined. The amount of nonspecific binding was calculated by extrapolation of the displacement curve. Protein determinations were performed using bovine serum albumin as a standard. The Kruskal-Wallis test and Mann-Whitney's U test were used to analyze differences in KD,Bmax, KH, and KL values. After scraping the cells off the culture plates, they were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and resuspended in serum-free medium at a concentration of 0.5–1.2 × 106 cells/ml. Aliquots of 0.2 ml were transferred to test tubes along with the phosphodiesterase inhibitor rolipram (30 μm) added to a final volume of 0.3 ml. The reaction was terminated with 50 μm perchloric acid to a final concentration of 0.1 m after a 10-min incubation at 37 °C. Samples were neutralized with 60 μl of KOH, and the cAMP content in the supernatants was determined with a protein binding assay (13Nordstedt C. Fredholm B.B. Anal. Biochem. 1990; 189: 231-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). The following experiments were performed: first, the effect of different concentrations of CPA (0.3–300 nm) on the cAMP accumulation induced by forskolin (30 μm) and dopamine (0.1 μm); second, the effect of CPA (30 nm) and DPCPX (30 nm) on the cAMP accumulation induced by different concentrations of dopamine (10 nm to 30 μm); and third, the effect of different concentrations of CPA (0.01–10 μm) on the cAMP accumulation induced by dopamine (10 μm) after PTX pretreatment (200 ng/ml for 4 h). Student's t test and one-way and bifactorial ANOVA (followed by post hoc protected least square difference method) were used for statistical analysis. Different levels of A1 receptor mRNA were obtained with the Northern blot analysis of the different hygromycin-resistant clones. A1 receptor mRNA was not detected in cells not transfected with A1 receptor cDNA (D1cells) (Fig. 1). A significant correlation (linear regression analysis, r 2 = 0.93 and p = 0.0001) was found between the relative A1 receptor mRNA content (optical density) obtained from the Northern blot analysis and the A1 receptor density (log Bmax values) obtained from the saturation experiments with [3H]DPCPX in membrane preparations from the different clones (Fig. 1). The nonspecific binding was <5% of the total binding. The D1 cells did not show any significant [3H]DPCPX-specific binding. A clone with similar concentrations of A1 and D1 binding sites (A1D1 cells) was chosen for the subsequent experiments. The Bmax and KDvalues for [3H] DPCPX binding in the A1D1 cells were 4.0 ± 0.4 pmol/mg of protein and 2.0 ± 0.1 nm (means ± S.E.,n = 4), respectively (Fig. 2). The determined KDvalue is in close agreement with the values previously reported for membrane preparations from Chinese hamster ovary cells and Escherichia coli cells expressing human A1receptors (9Townsend-Nicholson A.

For comparison, the Bmaxand KD values for [3H]DPCPX binding in membrane preparations from rat striatum have been reported to be ∼1 pmol/mg of protein and 1 nm, respectively (15Cunha R.A.

KH, KL, and RH values (in medians and, in parentheses, the interquartile range) were estimated to 4.2 (22.1) nm, 163.0 (145.2) nm, and 8.0% (5.8), respectively. The determinedKL value is similar to the Kivalue obtained from competition experiments of CPA versus[3H]DPCPX in membrane preparations from E. coli cells expressing human A1 receptors (14Jockers R. Linder M.E. Hohenegger M. Nanoff C. Bertin B. Strosberg A.D. Marullo S. Freissmuth M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32077-32084Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (the absence of G proteins in E. coli membranes precludes the analysis of the high affinity state of a G protein-linked receptor). No significant differences were obtained between the D1 and A1D1cells regarding the Bmax and KD values for the D1 binding sites labeled with [3H]SCH 23390. The Bmax values for the D1 and A1D1 cells were 4.2 ± 0.2 and 4.6 ± 0.3 pmol/mg of protein (means ± S.E.), respectively. The KD values for the D1 and A1D1 cells were 2.6 ± 0.3 and 2.4 ± 0.2 nm (means ± S.E., n = 4), respectively. The nonspecific binding was <5% of the total binding. The A1 agonist CPA did not significantly alter [3H]SCH 23390 binding in A1D1cell membranes (Bmax = 4.4 ± 0.1 pmol/mg of protein and KD = 2.2 ± 0.2 nm(means ± S.E.)) (Fig. 3). Competition experiments of dopamine versus the dopamine D1antagonist [3H]SCH 23390 in membrane preparations from both D1 and A1D1 cells showed a significantly better fit for two binding sites than for one binding site (F test, p < 0.05). SimilarKH and KL values were obtained in membrane preparations from D1 and A1D1 cells, and the proportion of D1 receptors in the high affinity state (RH values) was ∼10% in both cases (Fig. 4 and Table I). In the presence of Gpp(NH)p (100 μm), a significantly better fit for one binding site (RH = 0) was obtained in most of the membrane preparations from either D1 or A1D1cells, with IC50 values very similar to theKL values obtained in the absence of Gpp(NH)p. The same effect as that induced by Gpp(NH)p was obtained in the presence of the A1 agonist CPA (1–100 nm) in membrane preparations from A1D1 cells. On the other hand, CPA (0.1 and 10 μm) was ineffective in membrane preparations from D1 cells (Fig. 4 and Table I). Pretreatment of the A1D1 cells with PTX counteracted the effect of a low concentration of CPA (10 nm), but it did not counteract the effect of 10 μm CPA or 100 μm Gpp(NH)p (Fig. 5 and Table I). The degree of PTX-induced [32P]ADP-ribosylation was markedly reduced in membrane preparations from PTX-pretreated A1D1 cells compared with nonpretreated cells (Fig. 6).Table ICompetition-inhibition experiments of dopamine versus the dopamine D1 antagonist [3H]SCH 23390 in membrane preparations from A1D1 and D1 cellsTreatmentRHKHKL/IC50%μmμmA1D1 cells Control12.0 (3.9)0.2 (2.8)65.5 (4.1) CPA, 0.1 nm14.5 (11.4)0.4 (0.9)61.0 (21.5) CPA, 1 nm0.0 (0.0)1-ap < 0.01 compared with control (Kruskal-Wallis and MannWhitney's U tests).49.5 (13.0) CPA, 10 nm0.0 (5.4)1-ap < 0.01 compared with control (Kruskal-Wallis and MannWhitney's U tests).52.3 (24.9) CPA, 100 nm0.0 (0.0)1-ap < 0.01 compared with control (Kruskal-Wallis and MannWhitney's U tests).60.6 (10.9)A1D1 cells Control9.0 (13.0)0.3 (6.2)64.8 (47.6) Gpp(NH)p, 100 μm0.0 (0.0)1-ap < 0.01 compared with control (Kruskal-Wallis and MannWhitney's U tests).40.5 (38.1)A1D1 cells PTX control9.0 (5.0)0.6 (1.7)73.0 (15.3) PTX + CPA, 10 nm12.5 (13.0)1.8 (2.5)64.7 (13.7)A1D1 cells PTX control10.3 (7.2)0.4 (2.7)62.1 (20.2) PTX + CPA, 10 μm0.0 (0.0)1-ap < 0.01 compared with control (Kruskal-Wallis and MannWhitney's U tests).56.6 (23.1)A1D1 cells PTX control12.0 (6.9)0.7 (4.1)52.7 (9.8) PTX + Gpp(NH)p, 100 μm0.0 (2.0)1-ap < 0.01 compared with control (Kruskal-Wallis and MannWhitney's U tests).43.4 (7.5)D1 cells Control12.8 (1.3)0.2 (0.3)90.0 (18.1) CPA, 0.1 μm12.7 (4.3)0.1 (0.9)87.0 (38.0)D1 cells Control10.3 (5.8)0.3 (0.5)54.5 (22.3) CPA, 10 μm11.7 (12.3)0.4 (2.5)58.4 (9.4)D1 cells Control9.5 (6.0)0.4 (0.9)66.9 (37.4) Gpp(NH)p, 100 μm0.0 (6.0)1-ap < 0.01 compared with control (Kruskal-Wallis and MannWhitney's U tests).63.8 (36.0)1-a p < 0.01 compared with control (Kruskal-Wallis and MannWhitney's U tests).

In A1D1 cells, dopamine induced a significant concentration-dependent increase in cAMP accumulation (Fig. 8). The effect of dopamine was significantly antagonized by CPA (30 nm) (bifactorial ANOVA, p < 0.001 for the factors dopamine and CPA) (Fig. 8). The EC50 values (95% confidence intervals in parentheses) of the concentration-response curves of dopamine in the absence and presence of CPA, obtained by nonlinear regression analysis, were 0.2 (0.03–1.6) μm and 0.6 (0.02–14.9) μm, respectively. The maximal response values (95% confidence intervals in parentheses) in the absence and presence of CPA were 0.5 (0.4–0.6) pmol/50 μl and 0.3 (0.2–0.4) pmol/50 μl, respectively. On the other hand, the effect of dopamine was significantly potentiated by DPCPX (30 nm) (bifactorial ANOVA, p < 0.001 for the factors dopamine and DPCPX) (Fig. 8). The EC50 values (95% confidence intervals in parentheses) of the concentration-response curves of dopamine in the absence and presence of DPCPX were 0.4 (0.2–0.9) μm and 0.3 (0.09–0.8) μm, respectively. The maximal response values (95% confidence intervals in parentheses) in the absence and presence of DPCPX were 0.9 (0.8–0.9) pmol/50 μl and 1.2 (1.0–1.3) pmol/50 μl, respectively. Since they were independently analyzed, the basal levels of cAMP (dopamine concentration = 0) were not included in the ANOVA. cAMP basal levels were significantly increased by DPCPX (Student's t test, p < 0.05), and they were not modified by CPA (Fig. 8). In PTX-pretreated A1D1 cells, the basal levels of cAMP were significantly higher than in the control experiment, without PTX pretreatment (0.41 ± 0.01 and 0.23 ± 0.01 pmol/50 μl (means ± S.E.), respectively). CPA also induced a significant concentration-dependent inhibition of cAMP accumulation induced by a high concentration of dopamine (10 μm), and the cAMP accumulation induced by dopamine (10 μm) was significantly higher in PTX-pretreated cells (bifactorial ANOVA,p < 0.001 for the factors CPA and PTX) (Fig. 9). However, CPA was more effective in control cells. In PTX-pretreated cells, only a high concentration of CPA (10 μm) significantly antagonized cAMP accumulation induced by dopamine (10 μm) (post hoc one-way ANOVA,p < 0.05) (Fig. 9).Figure 8Counteracting effect of the adenosine A1 agonist CPA (30 nm) and potentiating effect of the A1 antagonist DPCPX (30 nm) on the cAMP accumulation induced by dopamine in A1D1cells.

Both receptors were shown to be functional in cAMP accumulation experiments. It has been previously shown that dopamine induces a concentration-dependent increase in cAMP accumulation in Ltk− cells transfected with the human D1 receptor cDNA (D1 cells), but not in nontransfected cells (7Liu Y.F. Civelli O. Zhou Q.-Y. Albert P.R. Mol. Endocrinol. 1992; 6: 1815-1824Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). It was also shown that the effect of dopamine is mediated by D1 receptors since it was selectively counteracted by a D1 but not a D2receptor antagonist (7Liu Y.F. Civelli O. Zhou Q.-Y. Albert P.R. Mol. Endocrinol. 1992; 6: 1815-1824Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). In the present experiments, dopamine-induced cAMP accumulation was also demonstrated in the A1D1 cells, with an EC50 value very similar to the KH value obtained in the [3H]SCH 23390-dopamine competition experiments (∼0.3 μm). Furthermore, in A1D1 cells, the A1 agonist CPA counteracted the cAMP accumulation induced by dopamine or forskolin, with an IC50 value similar to the KH value shown in [3H]DPCPX-CPA competition experiments (1 nmrange). In addition, the A1 antagonist DPCPX was found to significantly increase the basal levels of cAMP and to potentiate dopamine-induced cAMP accumulation. Altogether, these results show the existence of a functional antagonistic interaction between A1 and D1 receptors in A1D1 cells. Nonlinear regression analysis indicated that the CPA- and DPCPX-mediated effects on dopamine-induced cAMP accumulation were mainly due to changes in the maximal stimulation without changes in EC50. This suggests that, in agreement with the results obtained from radioligand binding experiments, the A1 receptor-mediated modulation of D1 receptors does not involve changes in the affinity of D1 receptors for agonists. This is in contrast to the A2A-D2interaction (see the Introduction), where A2A receptor stimulation induces a decrease in the affinity of D2receptors for agonists (4Ferré S. von Euler G. Johansson B. Fredholm B.B. Fuxe K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 88: 7238-7241Crossref Scopus (499) Google Scholar, 6Dasgupta S. Ferré S. Kull B. Hedlund P. Finnman U.-B. Ahlberg S. Arenas E. Fredholm B.B. Fuxe K. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1996; 316: 325-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The effects of the A1antagonist also suggest that adenosine released by these cells exerts a tonic inhibition of D1 receptor-mediated function through the A1-D1 interaction. The radioligand binding experiments carried out with membrane preparations from the cotransfected A1D1 cells showed results very similar to those obtained with rat striatal membrane preparations (5Ferré S. Popoli P. Giménez-Llort L. Finnman U.-B. Martı́nez E. Scotti de Carolis A. Fuxe K. Neuroreport. 1994; 6: 73-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). The only difference was the lower proportion of D1 receptors in the high affinity state (D1H) in the A1D1 cells (∼10%) as compared with the rat striatal membranes (∼30%) (5Ferré S. Popoli P. Giménez-Llort L. Finnman U.-B. Martı́nez E. Scotti de Carolis A. Fuxe K. Neuroreport. 1994; 6: 73-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Since it has been previously shown that the density of D1H correlates with the G protein content and with the endogenous dopamine levels (16Hervé D. Trovero F. Blanc G. Glowinski J. Tassin J.-P. Neuroscience. 1992; 46: 687-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), this difference might reflect either a low content of G proteins or the absence of a previous exposure of the D1 receptors to dopamine. Both the GTP analogue Gpp(NH)p and CPA induced a significant reduction in the proportion of D1H. Gpp(NH)p, but not CPA, was also effective in membrane preparations from control cells containing D1 but not A1 receptors, which demonstrates that the A1 receptors are required for CPA to have an effect. Since D1H represents the D1receptors coupled to the G protein, these results can be interpreted as an uncoupling of the D1 receptor from its G protein induced by A1 receptor stimulation. PTX induces an uncoupling of the A1 receptor from its G protein by inducing an ADP-ribosylation of the Gα subunit of the Gi (and Go) protein family. This results in a reduction of the number of A1 receptors in the high affinity state and in a blockade of A1 receptor signal transduction (17Kurose H. Katada T. Amano T. Ui M. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 4870-4875Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18Hsia J.A. Moss J. Hewlett E.L. Vaughan M. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 1086-1090Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Cote T.E. Frey E.A. Sekura R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 8693-8698Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A1D1 cells were exposed to PTX to study the possible involvement of Gi proteins in the A1 receptor-mediated uncoupling of the D1receptor from the Gs protein. As with the blockade of A1 receptors with the A1 antagonist DPCPX, PTX induced a significant increase in the basal levels of cAMP and potentiated dopamine-induced cAMP accumulation. This gives functional support for the blockade of A1 receptor signal transduction by PTX in these experiments. It was found that PTX counteracted the effect of CPA (10 nm), but not of Gpp(NH)p, on D1 receptor binding characteristics, suggesting that the Gi protein was, in fact, necessary for the intramembrane A1-D1 interaction. However, a higher concentration of CPA (10 μm), which is sufficient to bind to the A1 receptor in the low affinity state in the A1D1 cells (see competitive inhibition curves of CPA versus [3H]DPCPX), could still uncouple D1 receptors from the Gs protein after PTX pretreatment. This effect of CPA was not reproduced in D1cells, which shows that it is not a nonspecific effect, but is A1 receptor-mediated. Furthermore, in agreement with the radioligand binding experiments, a high concentration of CPA (10 μm) was still able to significantly decrease dopamine-induced cAMP accumulation after PTX pretreatment. The PTX-induced ribosylation, although very distinct, was not complete (see the SDS-polyacrylamide gel in Fig. 6). Therefore, it is still possible that stimulation of the low amount of A1 receptors in the high affinity state left after PTX pretreatment with the high concentration of CPA would be able to reproduce the same effect as the low concentration of CPA in PTX-nonpretreated cells. Nevertheless, the clear correlation between the results obtained with the radioligand binding and cAMP accumulation experiments suggests that the intramembrane A1-D1 interaction involved in the binding experiments is related to the A1-D1interaction found at the adenylyl cyclase level. In summary, three main findings have been obtained in this work. The first finding is that in membrane preparations from stably cotransfected A1D1 cells, the stimulation of A1 receptors induces an uncoupling of the D1receptor from its G protein. This intramembrane A1-D1 interaction has the same characteristics as that previously found in rat striatum (5Ferré S. Popoli P. Giménez-Llort L. Finnman U.-B. Martı́nez E. Scotti de Carolis A. Fuxe K. Neuroreport. 1994; 6: 73-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). The demonstration of this interaction in an artificial and very different cellular type and cellular environment strongly suggests that these kind of intramembrane receptor-receptor interactions (1Zoli M. Agnati L.F. Hedlund P. Li X.M. Ferré S. Fuxe K. Mol. Neurobiol. 1993; 7: 293-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar) represent a generalized functionally important mechanism in mammalian cells. The second finding is a functional antagonistic A1-D1 interaction at the adenylyl cyclase level. Although previously shown in homogenates of rat striatum (20Abbracchio M.P. Colombo F. Di Luca M. Zaratin P. Cattabeni F. Pharmacol. Res. Commun. 1987; 19: 275-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), this is the first time that such an interaction has been demonstrated at the cellular level. Finally, the third finding is the correlation between the results obtained with the radioligand binding and cAMP accumulation experiments, suggesting that the intramembrane A1-D1 interaction involved in the binding experiments is related to the A1-D1interaction found at the adenylyl cyclase level. Similar interactions are likely to occur in nerve cells that express both A1 and D1 receptors, such as the γ-aminobutyric acidergic strionigral-strioentopeducular neurons (21Ferré S. O'Connor W.T.

Phosphorylation of phospholamban occurs on both Ser16 and Thr17 during isoproterenol stimulation. To determine the physiological significance of dual site phospholamban phosphorylation, we generated transgenic models expressing either wild-type or the Ser16 → Ala mutant phospholamban in the cardiac compartment of the phospholamban knockout mice. Transgenic lines with similar levels of mutant or wild-type phospholamban were studied in parallel. Langendorff perfusion indicated that the basal hyperdynamic cardiac function of the knockout mouse was reversed to the same extent by reinsertion of either wild-type or mutant phospholamban. However, isoproterenol stimulation was associated with much lower responses in the contractile parameters of mutant phospholamban compared with wild-type hearts. These attenuated responses were due to lack of phosphorylation of mutant phospholamban, assessed in 32P labeling perfusion experiments. The lack of phospholamban phosphorylation in vivo was not due to conversion of Ser16 to Ala, since the mutated phospholamban form could serve as substrate for the calcium-calmodulin-dependent protein kinase in vitro. These findings indicate that phosphorylation of Ser16 is a prerequisite for Thr17phosphorylation in phospholamban, and prevention of phosphoserine formation results in attenuation of the β-agonist stimulatory responses in the mammalian heart.

Dephosphorylated PLB is an inhibitor, and phosphorylation of PLB removes its inhibitory effects on the SR Ca2+-ATPase. Recently, the critical role of PLB in the regulation of cardiac contractility has been defined through gene transfer (1Kadambi V.J. Ponniah S. Harrer J.M. Hoit B.D. Dorn G.W., II Walsh R.A.

Cardiac-specific overexpression of PLB was associated with decreases in the affinity of the SR Ca2+-ATPase for Ca2+ and depressed cardiac function, whereas PLB deficiency resulted in increased Ca2+ affinity of the Ca2+-ATPase and enhanced myocardial performance. Furthermore, the stimulatory effects to β-adrenergic agonists were more pronounced in the PLB-overexpressing hearts, whereas these effects were attenuated in the PLB-knockout hearts compared with wild types (1Kadambi V.J.

These studies suggested that PLB plays a prominent role in the heart's responses to β-agonists. However, PLB is phosphorylated on both Ser16and Thr17 during isoproterenol stimulation (3Wegener A.D. Simmerman H.K. Lindemann J.P. Jones L.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 11468-11474Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and the relative contribution of each site in the altered contractile responses of the heart is not presently well known. In vitro studies have shown that Ser16 is phosphorylated by cAMP-dependent protein kinase, whereas Thr17 is phosphorylated by Ca2+-calmodulin-dependent protein kinase (4Simmerman H.K. Collins J.H. Theibert J.L. Wegener A.D. Jones L.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 13333-13341Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of each site occurs in an independent manner, although it is not presently clear whether the stimulatory effects of the two phosphorylations on SR Ca2+transport are additive (5Bilezikjian L.M.

Furthermore, elevation of intracellular [Ca2+] to higher levels than those attained by isoproterenol, which resulted in higher peak tension than that elicited during β-adrenergic stimulation, failed to phosphorylate PLB (3Wegener A.D. Simmerman H.K. Lindemann J.P. Jones L.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 11468-11474Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16Lindemann J.P. Watanabe A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 13122-13129Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, a recent study, using phosphorylation site-specific antibodies for PLB, indicated that cAMP-dependent and Ca2+-calmodulin-dependent phosphorylation of PLB can occur in an independent manner and their effects may be additive in vivo (17Mundina-Weilenmann C. Vittone L. Ortale M. de Cingolani G.C. Mattiazzi A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 33561-33567Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Thus, the functional role of dual site phosphorylation of PLB is not clear.The availability of the PLB knockout mouse in conjunction with site-specific mutagenesis technology have provided us with an excellent opportunity to further examine the interaction between the cAMP-dependent and the Ca2+-calmodulin-dependent pathways of PLB phosphorylation in the regulation of basal and β-agonist stimulated cardiac contractility in vivo. The aims of the present study were to: 1) determine whether reintroduction of PLB in the null background is feasible, and whether it is able to reverse the hyperdynamic cardiac phenotype of the PLB knockout mouse; and 2) elucidate the physiological role of Thr17 phosphorylation in PLB in the absence of Ser16 (Ser16 → Ala) by directing cardiac-specific expression of mutant PLB in the knockout background.DISCUSSIONOur results are the first to demonstrate that a cardiac phenotype, generated by gene targeting, can be reversed by reinsertion of the missing gene in the null background. In previous studies, we showed that ablation of PLB resulted in enhanced basal cardiac contractile parameters assessed at the cellular, organ, and intact animal levels (2Luo W. Grupp I.L. Harrer J.

Res. 1995; 77: 632-637Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). In this study, we used the α-myosin heavy chain promoter to direct cardiac-specific expression of wild-type PLB in the knockout background and observed reversal of the hyperdynamic function of the PLB-deficient hearts. The degree of inhibition of the contractile parameters was proportional to the expression levels of PLB, in agreement with our previous studies in PLB-heterozygous and PLB-homozygous mice (2Luo W. Grupp I.L. Harrer J. Ponniah S. Grupp G. Duffy J.J. Doetschman T. Kranias E.G. Circ. Res. 1994; 75: 401-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (627) Google Scholar, 21Luo W. Wolska B.M. Grupp I.L. Harrer J.M.

The success of PLB transgenesis in the genetically altered background, accompanied by reversal of the knockout phenotype, indicated that the PLB-deficient mouse provides an attractive model system for expression of various PLB mutants in the heart and elucidation of structure-function relationships in vivo. With the first mutant we studied, we sought to elucidate the functional significance of dual site PLB phosphorylation during β-adrenergic stimulation. A site-specific mutation was introduced into the PLB coding region, converting Ser16 to Ala, and mutant PLB expression was directed in the knockout background. Quantitative immunoblotting of cardiac homogenates and SR-enriched microsomal preparations showed that all the mutant PLB was inserted in the SR membranes. Transgenic mice, expressing similar levels of wild-type or mutant PLB in the heart, exhibited similar contractile parameters under basal conditions, indicating that the mutant PLB was capable of modulating contractility in a manner similar to that for wild-type PLB. However, isoproterenol stimulation was associated with much lower enhancement of the rates of contraction and relaxation in the PLB-mutant hearts compared with PLB-wild-type hearts, whereas the heart rate responses were similar between these groups. It is interesting to note that the maximal increases in contractile parameters of the PLB-mutant hearts were similar to those of PLB-knockout hearts under β-adrenergic stimulation. These findings suggest that mutation of Ser16 in PLB compromised the contribution of this phosphoprotein in the stimulatory responses of the heart to isoproterenol. Actually, when [32P]orthophosphate was included in the perfusate buffer, there was no 32P labeling of mutant PLB observed, even under maximal isoproterenol stimulation. However, in the same hearts, the degree of phosphorylation of troponin I and C-protein in the myofibrils was similar between hearts expressing mutant or wild-type PLB. Thus, cardiac phosphoproteins other than PLB were responsible for mediating the attenuated responses of the PLB-mutant hearts. To exclude the possibility that the lack of phosphothreonine in vivowas due to mutation of the adjacent Ser16 to Ala, cardiac homogenates from PLB-wild-type and PLB-mutant mice were incubatedin vitro under optimal phosphorylation conditions for the Ca2+-calmodulin-dependent protein kinase. The degree of mutant PLB phosphorylation was similar to that of wild-type PLB and phosphothreonine formation was verified using the phospholamban phosphorylation site-specific antibody, indicating that the mutant PLB form was capable of being phosphorylated on Thr17.The role of PLB phosphorylation by cAMP-dependent and Ca2+-calmodulin-dependent protein kinases has been the subject of several studies. Reports by Raeymaekers et al. (7Raeymaekers L. Hofmann F. Casteels R. Biochem. J. 1988; 252: 269-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar), Tada et al. (8Tada M. Inui M. Yamada M. Kadoma M. Kuzuya T. Abe H. Kakiuchi S. J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 1983; 15: 335-346Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), and Kranias (6Kranias E.G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1985; 844: 193-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) indicated that the stimulatory effects of the two protein kinases on sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ transport can be additive, whereas a study by Colyer and Wang (9Colyer J. Wang J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 17486-17493Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) suggested that maximal stimulation of the Ca2+ pump occurs by PLB phosphorylation at a single site and that additional phosphorylation of the other site does not further stimulate pump activity. Furthermore, all the in vitrostudies agree that phosphorylation of PLB by cAMP-dependent and Ca2+-calmodulin-dependent protein kinases occurs in an independent manner, whereas in vivo findings (3Wegener A.D. Simmerman H.K. Lindemann J.P. Jones L.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 11468-11474Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13Napolitano R. Vittone L. Mundina C. Chiappe de Cingolani G. Mattiazzi A.

Physiol. 1993; 264: H791-H797PubMed Google Scholar) indicate that phosphorylation/dephosphorylation of Thr17 occurs only subsequent to phosphorylation/dephosphorylation of Ser16 during β-adrenergic stimulation. Our findings in transgenic animals, demonstrated that: (a) Thr17 in PLB cannot be phosphorylated in the absence of Ser16 phosphorylation, even under maximal isoproterenol stimulation of intact, beating hearts; and (b) phosphorylation of Thr17 in PLB does not require prior phosphorylation of Ser16 in in vitro experiments. Thus, phosphorylation of Thr17occurs independently of Ser16 phosphorylation in vitro, whereas phosphorylation of the adjacent Ser16residue appears to be a prerequisite for in vivophosphothreonine formation during β-agonist stimulation. This apparent discrepancy between in vivo and in vitrofindings may be due to differences in the levels of calcium available to activate the SR Ca2+-calmodulin-dependent protein kinase. In vitro conditions generally include optimal calcium concentrations. However, in in vivo studies, phosphorylation of Ser16 may be required to occur first and enhance the SR Ca2+ uptake rates and, thus, SR Ca2+ load. This would lead to increased Ca2+levels released by the SR, activation of the Ca2+-calmodulin-dependent protein kinase, and phosphorylation of Thr17 in PLB. The phosphorylation and activation of the sarcolemmal Ca2+ channels may also contribute to the increased Ca2+ levels required forin vivo phosphorylation of Thr17 in PLB (17Mundina-Weilenmann C.

However, the inhibition of the SR-associated protein phosphatase 1 activity, which was suggested to be an important determinant for Thr17 phosphorylation (17Mundina-Weilenmann C. Vittone L. Ortale M. de Cingolani G.C. Mattiazzi A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 33561-33567Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), did not appear to play any role in our transgenic experiments, even under maximal isoproterenol stimulation.The functional significance of Ca2+-calmodulin-dependent phosphorylation of PLB has been previously examined in intact cardiac myocytes (15Mattiazzi A. Hove-Madsen L. Bers D.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 267: H812-H820Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 25Bassani R.A. Mattiazzi A. Bers D.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 268: H703-H712Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of PLB by Ca2+-calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II was suggested to increase the Vmax of the SR Ca2+-ATPase, whereas phosphorylation by protein kinase A increased the Ca2+ affinity of the pump (15Mattiazzi A. Hove-Madsen L. Bers D.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 267: H812-H820Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, inhibition of Ca2+-calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II was shown to slow-down sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ uptake and the decline of [Ca2+] even after inhibition of protein kinase A (25Bassani R.A. Mattiazzi A. Bers D.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 268: H703-H712Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that the phosphothreonine in PLB may be important in regulation of diastolic Ca2+ and prevention of cytosolic Ca2+ overload especially under pathophysiological conditions (17Mundina-Weilenmann C.

Pflugers Arch. 1997; 434: 475-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar).In summary, our findings indicate that the hyperdynamic PLB knockout phenotype can be reversed by reintroduction of PLB in the null background, and demonstrate the potential power of this technology in performing PLB structure-function studies in vivo. Expression of mutant PLB in which Ser16 was replaced by Ala in the knockout background indicated that the phosphorylation of Thr17 in PLB requires prior phosphorylation of Ser16 during β-adrenergic stimulation. In the absence of Ser16 phosphorylation, the degree of the stimulatory effects by β-agonists was similar to that obtained in PLB knockout hearts, suggesting that cardiac phosphoproteins other than PLB mediate these responses. Future studies using transgenic mice harboring the Thr17 → Ala or Ser16-Thr17 → Ala-Ala mutations in PLB will further delineate the interrelationship of dual site phosphorylation in PLB and elucidate the functional relevance of each phosphorylation site under physiological and pathophysiological conditions.

Cardiac-specific overexpression of PLB was associated with decreases in the affinity of the SR Ca2+-ATPase for Ca2+ and depressed cardiac function, whereas PLB deficiency resulted in increased Ca2+ affinity of the Ca2+-ATPase and enhanced myocardial performance. Furthermore, the stimulatory effects to β-adrenergic agonists were more pronounced in the PLB-overexpressing hearts, whereas these effects were attenuated in the PLB-knockout hearts compared with wild types (1Kadambi V.J.

Thus, the functional role of dual site phosphorylation of PLB is not clear. The availability of the PLB knockout mouse in conjunction with site-specific mutagenesis technology have provided us with an excellent opportunity to further examine the interaction between the cAMP-dependent and the Ca2+-calmodulin-dependent pathways of PLB phosphorylation in the regulation of basal and β-agonist stimulated cardiac contractility in vivo. The aims of the present study were to: 1) determine whether reintroduction of PLB in the null background is feasible, and whether it is able to reverse the hyperdynamic cardiac phenotype of the PLB knockout mouse; and 2) elucidate the physiological role of Thr17 phosphorylation in PLB in the absence of Ser16 (Ser16 → Ala) by directing cardiac-specific expression of mutant PLB in the knockout background. DISCUSSIONOur results are the first to demonstrate that a cardiac phenotype, generated by gene targeting, can be reversed by reinsertion of the missing gene in the null background. In previous studies, we showed that ablation of PLB resulted in enhanced basal cardiac contractile parameters assessed at the cellular, organ, and intact animal levels (2Luo W. Grupp I.L. Harrer J.

In this study, we used the α-myosin heavy chain promoter to direct cardiac-specific expression of wild-type PLB in the knockout background and observed reversal of the hyperdynamic function of the PLB-deficient hearts. The degree of inhibition of the contractile parameters was proportional to the expression levels of PLB, in agreement with our previous studies in PLB-heterozygous and PLB-homozygous mice (2Luo W. Grupp I.L. Harrer J. Ponniah S. Grupp G. Duffy J.J. Doetschman T. Kranias E.G. Circ. Res. 1994; 75: 401-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (627) Google Scholar, 21Luo W. Wolska B.M. Grupp I.L. Harrer J.M.

The success of PLB transgenesis in the genetically altered background, accompanied by reversal of the knockout phenotype, indicated that the PLB-deficient mouse provides an attractive model system for expression of various PLB mutants in the heart and elucidation of structure-function relationships in vivo. With the first mutant we studied, we sought to elucidate the functional significance of dual site PLB phosphorylation during β-adrenergic stimulation. A site-specific mutation was introduced into the PLB coding region, converting Ser16 to Ala, and mutant PLB expression was directed in the knockout background. Quantitative immunoblotting of cardiac homogenates and SR-enriched microsomal preparations showed that all the mutant PLB was inserted in the SR membranes. Transgenic mice, expressing similar levels of wild-type or mutant PLB in the heart, exhibited similar contractile parameters under basal conditions, indicating that the mutant PLB was capable of modulating contractility in a manner similar to that for wild-type PLB. However, isoproterenol stimulation was associated with much lower enhancement of the rates of contraction and relaxation in the PLB-mutant hearts compared with PLB-wild-type hearts, whereas the heart rate responses were similar between these groups. It is interesting to note that the maximal increases in contractile parameters of the PLB-mutant hearts were similar to those of PLB-knockout hearts under β-adrenergic stimulation. These findings suggest that mutation of Ser16 in PLB compromised the contribution of this phosphoprotein in the stimulatory responses of the heart to isoproterenol. Actually, when [32P]orthophosphate was included in the perfusate buffer, there was no 32P labeling of mutant PLB observed, even under maximal isoproterenol stimulation. However, in the same hearts, the degree of phosphorylation of troponin I and C-protein in the myofibrils was similar between hearts expressing mutant or wild-type PLB. Thus, cardiac phosphoproteins other than PLB were responsible for mediating the attenuated responses of the PLB-mutant hearts. To exclude the possibility that the lack of phosphothreonine in vivowas due to mutation of the adjacent Ser16 to Ala, cardiac homogenates from PLB-wild-type and PLB-mutant mice were incubatedin vitro under optimal phosphorylation conditions for the Ca2+-calmodulin-dependent protein kinase. The degree of mutant PLB phosphorylation was similar to that of wild-type PLB and phosphothreonine formation was verified using the phospholamban phosphorylation site-specific antibody, indicating that the mutant PLB form was capable of being phosphorylated on Thr17.The role of PLB phosphorylation by cAMP-dependent and Ca2+-calmodulin-dependent protein kinases has been the subject of several studies.

Furthermore, all the in vitrostudies agree that phosphorylation of PLB by cAMP-dependent and Ca2+-calmodulin-dependent protein kinases occurs in an independent manner, whereas in vivo findings (3Wegener A.D.

Physiol. 1993; 264: H791-H797PubMed Google Scholar) indicate that phosphorylation/dephosphorylation of Thr17 occurs only subsequent to phosphorylation/dephosphorylation of Ser16 during β-adrenergic stimulation. Our findings in transgenic animals, demonstrated that: (a) Thr17 in PLB cannot be phosphorylated in the absence of Ser16 phosphorylation, even under maximal isoproterenol stimulation of intact, beating hearts; and (b) phosphorylation of Thr17 in PLB does not require prior phosphorylation of Ser16 in in vitro experiments. Thus, phosphorylation of Thr17occurs independently of Ser16 phosphorylation in vitro, whereas phosphorylation of the adjacent Ser16residue appears to be a prerequisite for in vivophosphothreonine formation during β-agonist stimulation. This apparent discrepancy between in vivo and in vitrofindings may be due to differences in the levels of calcium available to activate the SR Ca2+-calmodulin-dependent protein kinase. In vitro conditions generally include optimal calcium concentrations. However, in in vivo studies, phosphorylation of Ser16 may be required to occur first and enhance the SR Ca2+ uptake rates and, thus, SR Ca2+ load. This would lead to increased Ca2+levels released by the SR, activation of the Ca2+-calmodulin-dependent protein kinase, and phosphorylation of Thr17 in PLB. The phosphorylation and activation of the sarcolemmal Ca2+ channels may also contribute to the increased Ca2+ levels required forin vivo phosphorylation of Thr17 in PLB (17Mundina-Weilenmann C.

https://openalex.org/W1536369380,"Adult rats intubated with a single dose of ethanol (alcohol; ∼5 g/kg) for 5 to 10 successive days incur neurodegeneration in the entorhinal cortex, dentate gyrus, and olfactory bulbs accompanied by cerebrocortical edema and electrolyte (Na+, K+) accumulation. The brain damage is not lessened by cotreatment with the NMDA receptor antagonist MK-801; also, as reported elsewhere, MK-801 as well as non-NMDA receptor and Ca2+ channel antagonists are not neuroprotective in a similar, but more compressed, intoxication protocol. However, cotreatment with the electrolyte transport inhibitor/diuretic furosemide reduces alcohol-dependent cerebrocortical damage by 75–85% while preventing brain hydration and electrolyte elevations; olfactory bulb neurodegeneration is not attenuated. In parallel in vitro studies, rat organotypic entorhinal/hippocampal slice cultures exposed to alcohol (50–200 mM) 15 h/day for 6 days, mirroring episodic intoxication in vivo, demonstrate concentration-related release of the cytotoxic indicator, lactate dehydrogenase. Analogous to the in vivo findings, furosemide blocks this alcohol-induced in vitro cytotoxicity. Our results showing neuroprotection by furosemide indicate that brain edema and swelling are essential events in the brain damage induced by episodic alcohol exposure. Furosemide and related agents might be useful as neuroprotective agents in alcohol abuse. We suggest that the neurodegeneration is elicited in part by edema-dependent oxidative stress, but the regional selectivity of the damage may be best explained by physical (mechanical) compression of the limbic cortex against the adjacent tympanic bulla and subsequent neuronal cytoskeletal collapse. A scheme for these apparently nonexcitotoxic metabolic and mechanical pathways initiated by repeated alcohol exposure is proposed.—Collins, M. A., Zou, J.-Y., Neafsey, E. J.

Current understanding of its global budget, including the balance of natural and anthropogenic sources, is largely based on the atmospheric losses calculated with chemical models. A representative one-dimensional model used here describes the photochemical coupling between N 2 O and stratospheric ozone (O 3 ), which can easily be decomposed into its natural modes. The primary, longest lived mode describes most of the atmospheric perturbation due to anthropogenic N 2 O sources, and this pattern may be observable. The photolytic link between O 3 and N 2 O is identified as the mechanism causing this mode to decay 10 to 15 percent more rapidly than the N 2 O mean atmospheric lifetime, affecting the inference of anthropogenic sources."

The synaptic function of this protein was investigated by injecting, into the giant presynaptic terminal of squid, peptides that inhibit the ATPase activity of NSF stimulated by the soluble NSF attachment protein (SNAP). These peptides reduced the amount and slowed the kinetics of neurotransmitter release as a result of actions that required vesicle turnover and occurred at a step subsequent to vesicle docking. These results define NSF as an essential participant in synaptic vesicle exocytosis that regulates the kinetics of neurotransmitter release and, thereby, the integrative properties of synapses."
https://openalex.org/W1821995966,"The inflammatory reaction associated with the deposition of monosodium urate (MSU) crystals in synovial spaces is known to be due to interactions with polymorphonuclear neutrophils mediated by presently unidentified surface structures. In this study, we have observed that antibodies directed against CD16 (VIFcRIII) and CD11b (VIM12) selectively and potently inhibit the activation of neutrophils by MSU crystals. The responses affected include the stimulation of tyrosine phosphorylation, activation of the tyrosine kinase syk, tyrosine phosphorylation of the proto-oncogene Cbl, mobilization of calcium, and stimulation of the activity of phospholipase D and of the production of superoxide anions. Tyrosine phosphorylation responses to MSU crystals develop during the Me2SO4-induced differentiation of HL-60 cells in parallel with the surface expression of CD16. These data strongly support the hypothesis that inflammatory microcrystals interact opportunistically with CD16 initially, and that the signal transduction pathways activated thereby depend on CD11b. An examination of the relevance of the hypothesis that an uncontrolled activation of CD16/CD11b may play a role in inflammatory reactions associated with a dysregulation of neutrophil function (other than crystal arthropathies) appears warranted on the basis of the present results."

https://openalex.org/W2076444878,"Insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1) is phosphorylated on multiple tyrosine residues by ligand-activated insulin receptors. These tyrosine phosphorylation sites serve to dock several Src homology 2-containing signaling proteins. In addition, IRS-1 contains a pleckstrin homology domain and a phosphotyrosine binding domain (PTB) implicated in protein-protein and protein-lipid interactions. In a yeast two-hybrid screening using XenopusIRS-1 (xIRS-1) pleckstrin homology-PTB domains as bait, we identified aXenopus homolog of Rho-associated kinase α (xROKα) as a potential xIRS-1-binding protein. The original clone contained the carboxyl terminus of xROKα (xROK-C) including the putative Rho binding domain but lacking the amino-terminal kinase domain. Further analyses in yeast indicated that xROK-C bound to the putative PTB domain of xIRS-1. Binding of xROK-C to xIRS-1 was confirmed inXenopus oocytes after microinjection of mRNA corresponding to xROK-C. Furthermore, microinjection of xROK-C mRNA inhibited insulin-induced mitogen-activated protein kinase activation with a concomitant inhibition of oocyte maturation. In contrast, microinjection of xROK-C mRNA did not inhibit mitogen-activated protein kinase activation or oocyte maturation induced by progesterone or by microinjection of viral Ras (v-Ras) mRNA. These results suggest that xROKα may play a role in insulin signaling via a direct interaction with xIRS-1."

In seropositive asymptomatic subjects, HIV-1 proviral DNA was present in the nuclei of germ cells at all stages of their differentiation. The presence of provirus did not induce germ cell damage, was associated with normal spermatogenesis, and was not accompanied by morphologic signs of immune response. The observed HIV hybridization pattern of germ cells suggests clonal infection. Mechanisms responsible for HIV penetration in testicular germ cells remain to be clarified; however, the possibility of a direct infection of the germ cells by cell-free virus is suggested. In the testes of AIDS-deceased men, histologic features of hypoplasia with arrested spermatogenesis were evident, and few infected spermatogonia and spermatocytes were observed. The whole of these data demonstrates that the testis is a site of early viral localization that fails to elicit an immunological response, and that HIV-seropositive men produce infected spermatozoa that are released in the genital tract."
https://openalex.org/W1987245159,"Pulmonary surfactant proteins A (SP-A) and D (SP-D) are collectins in the C-type lectin superfamily. SP-A binds to dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine and galactosylceramide, and it regulates the uptake and secretion of surfactant lipids by alveolar type II cells. In contrast, SP-D binds to phosphatidylinositol (PI) and glucosylceramide (GlcCer). We investigated the functional region in the carbohydrate recognition domain of rat SP-A and SP-D that is involved in binding lipids and interacting with alveolar type II cells by using chimeric proteins. Chimeras ad3, ad4, and ad5 were constructed with SP-A/SP-D splice junctions at Gly194/Glu321, Gln173/Thr300, and Met134/Cys261, respectively. All three chimeras lost SP-A-specific functions. Chimeras ad3,ad4, and ad5 bound to PI with increasing activity. In contrast, chimeras ad3 and ad4 did not bind to GlcCer, whereas ad5 avidly bound this lipid. From these results, we conclude that 1) the SP-A region of Glu195–Phe228 is required for lipid and type II cell interactions, 2) the SP-D region of Cys261–Phe355 is required for optimal lipid interactions, and 3) the structural requirement for the binding of SP-D to PI is different from that for GlcCer.

Pulmonary surfactant is a complex mixture of lipids and proteins that acts to keep alveoli from collapsing during expiration (1King R.J. Clements J.A. Am. J.

Voelker D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25943-25946Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). SP-A binds to dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine (DPPC) (3Kuroki Y. Akino T. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 3068-3073Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), a lipid component essential for the biophysical function of surfactant, and initiates aggregation of liposomes containing DPPC in the presence of calcium (4Hawgood S. Benson B. Hamilton R.J. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 184-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). SP-A also binds to the glycosphingolipids galactosylceramide (GalCer), lactosylcermide, and asialo-gangliotriaosylceramide (5Kuroki Y. Gasa S. Ogasawara Y. Makita A. Akino T. Arch. Biochem.

Chem. 1992; 267: 9972-9979Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The specific interaction of SP-A with alveolar type II cells has also been documented. SP-A inhibits the secretion of surfactant phospholipids (7Rice W. Ross G.F. Singleton F.M. Dingle S. Whitsett J.A. J. Appl. Physiol. 1987; 63: 692-698Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar,8Dobbs L.G. Wright J.R. Hawgood S. Gonzalez R. Venstrom K. Nellenbogen J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Chem. 1987; 262: 2888-2894Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, SP-A binds to alveolar type II cells with high affinity (10Kuroki Y. Mason R.J. Voelker D.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 5566-5570Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar,11Wright J.R. Borchelt J.D. Hawgood S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Voelker D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 17596-17602Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The in vitro functions of SP-A have all of the characteristics expected of a regulatory protein involved in surfactant homeostasis within the alveolar compartment of the lung. However, mouse strains with null alleles for SP-A are viable and appear to have only modest alterations in surfactant properties (13Korfhagen T.R. Bruno M.D. Ross G.F. Huelsman K.M. Ikegami M. Jobe A.H. Wert S.E. Stripp B.R. Morris R.E. Glasser S.W. Bachurski C.J. Iwamoto H.S. Whitsett J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 9594-9599Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar). The possibility of functional redundancy between SP-A and other molecules remains to be elucidated. In addition to its interaction with lipid and type II cell ligands, SP-A interacts with macrophages (14Pison U. Wright J.R. Hawgood S. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 262: L412-L417PubMed Google Scholar) and a large spectrum of microorganism, including viruses (15Van Iwaarden J.F. van Strijp J.A.G. Visser H. Haagsman H.P. Verhoef J. van Golde L.M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25039-25043Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and Pneumocystis carinii (16Zimmerman P.E. Voelker D.R. McCormack F.X. Paulsrud J.R. Martin W.J.I. J. Clin. Invest. 1992; 89: 143-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar), and is now thought to be an important component of the innate (antibody-independent) immune system of the lung. SP-A-deficient mice have been shown to be susceptible to group B streptococcal infection (17LeVine A.M. Bruno M.D. Huelsman K.M. Ross G.F. Whitsett J.A. Korfhagen T.R. J. Immunol. 1997; 158: 4336-4340PubMed Google Scholar). A clear understanding of the interaction of SP-A with its multiple ligands is likely to provide important insight into its physiological roles in surfactant dynamics and host defense. Surfactant protein D (SP-D) is also a hydrophilic protein of the extracellular alveolar compartment produced by type II cells (18Persson A. Rust K. Chang D. Moxley M. Longmore W. Crouch E. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 8576-8584Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 19Persson A. Chang D. Rust K. Moxley M. Longmore W. Crouch E. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 6361-6367Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). It has a molecular mass of 43 kDa under denaturing and reducing conditions (20Crouch E. Rust K. Persson A. Mariencheck W. Moxley M. Longmore W. Am. J. Physiol. 1991; 260: L247-L253Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). SP-D also binds specific lipids, but its specificity is distinct from that of SP-A. SP-D binds phosphatidylinositol (PI) (21Ogasawara Y. Kuroki Y. Akino T. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 21244-21249Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22Persson A., V. Gibbons B., J. Shoemaker J., D. Moxley M., A. Longmore W., J. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 12183-12189Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) and glucosylceramide (GlcCer) (23Kuroki Y. Gasa S. Ogasawara Y. Shiratori M. Makita A. Akino T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 187: 963-969Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The role of SP-D in lipid metabolism in the surfactant system has not yet been clearly defined. A growing body of evidence also implicates SP-D as an important element of the innate immune system of the lung. The protein binds viruses (24Hartshorn K.L. Crouch E.C. White M.R. Eggleton P. Tauber A.I. Chang D. Sastry K. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 94: 311-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar), bacteria, fungi (25Kuan S.-F. Rust K. Crouch E. J. Clin. Invest. 1992; 90: 97-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar), and P. carinii (26O'Riordan D.M. Standing J.E. Kwon K.-Y. Chang D. Crouch E.C. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 95: 2699-2710Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). SP-D also binds to different classes of molecules on macrophages. One of the SP-D-binding proteins found on the surface of alveolar macrophages has been purified (27Holmskov U. Lawson P. Teisner B. Tornoe I. Willis A.C. Morgan C. Koch C. Reid K.B.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13743-13749Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). A clear definition of the ligands for SP-D and their binding sites on the protein is essential for understanding how this protein functions within the alveolar compartment. SP-A and SP-D belong to the collectin subgroup of the C-type lectin superfamily, along with mannose-binding protein (MBP), bovine conglutinin, and the protein CL43 (28Day A., J. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1994; 22: 83-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). These proteins possess characteristic primary structures that are organized into four domains: 1) a cysteine-containing amino terminus, 2) a collagen-like domain, 3) a neck domain, and 4) a carbohydrate recognition domain (CRD) (2Kuroki Y. Voelker D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25943-25946Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). SP-A forms a bouquet-like structure consisting of an octadecamer composed of six trimeric subunits (29Voss T. Eistetter H. Schäfer K.P. Engel J. J. Mol. Biol. 1988; 201: 219-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar), whereas SP-D is a dodecamer that forms a cruciform structure (30Lu J. Wiedemann H. Holmskov U. Thiel S. Timpl R. Reid K.B. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 215: 793-799Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Although lung collectins possess homologous structures and exhibit similar carbohydrate binding specificities, they show quite different properties of binding lipids and interacting with alveolar type II cells. Previous studies have suggested that the CRD of SP-A or SP-D plays a critical role in interactions with lipids and type II cells (31Murata Y. Kuroki Y. Akino T. Biochem. J. 1993; 291: 71-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 32Kuroki Y. McCormack F.X. Ogasawara Y. Mason R.J. Voelker D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29793-29800Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 33Ogasawara Y. McCormack F.X. Mason R.J. Voelker D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29785-29792Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 34Ogasawara Y. Voelker D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19052-19058Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). However, the regions of the CRDs that are essential for lipid binding and type II cell interactions have not yet been fully identified. The purpose of this study was to investigate the functional region in the CRD of rat SP-A or SP-D for the interactions with lipids and type II cells by using chimeric proteins of SP-A and SP-D. We constructed SP-A/SP-D chimeras in which progressively longer carboxyl-terminal regions of SP-D were substituted for the corresponding SP-A regions and examined whether these chimeras retained the SP-A functions or acquired the SP-D functions. We also determined whether anti-rat SP-A monoclonal antibodies that affect the SP-A functions recognized the SP-A/SP-D chimeras. In this report, we show that the SP-A region of Glu195–Phe228 is required for the interaction of SP-A with lipids and type II cells and that the structural requirement for the binding of SP-D to PI is different from that for its GlcCer binding. Surfactant was isolated from lung lavage fluids of Sprague-Dawley rats (4Hawgood S. Benson B. Hamilton R.J. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 184-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar) that had been given an intratracheal instillation of silica in saline 4 weeks before the lavage (35Dethloff L.A. Gilmore L.B. Brody A.R. Hook G.E.R. Biochem. J. 1986; 233: 111-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The surfactant was delipidated by extraction with 1-butanol. SP-A was isolated and purified from the delipidated surfactant by mannose-Sepharose 6B column chromatography followed by gel filtration over Bio-Gel A5m as described previously (10Kuroki Y. Mason R.J. Voelker D.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 5566-5570Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). DPPC, phosphatidylcholine from egg yolk, PI, phosphatidylglycerol from egg yolk, phosphatidylserine (PS) from bovine brain, GalCer, and GlcCer were purchased from Sigma. Cholesterol was obtained from Serdary Research Laboratories. The 1-palmitoyl-2-[3H]palmitoyl-l-3-phosphatidylcholine ([3H]DPPC) was purchased from NEN Life Science Products. The isolation and sequencing of the 1.6-kilobase cDNA for rat SP-A was described previously (36Sano K. Fisher J. Mason R.J. Kuroki Y. Schilling J. Benson B. Voelker D.R. Biochim. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1987; 144: 367-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). The isolation of the 1.2-kilobase cDNA for rat SP-D was also previously reported (37Shimizu H. Fisher J.H. Papst P. Benson B. Lau K. Mason R.J. Voelker D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 1853-1857Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We constructed three chimeric proteins with SP-A and SP-D in which the progressively longer carboxyl-terminal regions of the SP-D CRD were substituted for the corresponding CRD regions of SP-A. The chimeric molecules used in this study are schematically represented in Fig. 1. Chimera ad3 consists of Asn1–Gly194 of SP-A and Glu321–Phe355 of SP-D. Chimera ad4consists of Asn1–Gln173 of SP-A and Thr300–Phe355 of SP-D. Chimera ad5consists of Asn1–Met134 of SP-A and Cys261–Phe355 of SP-D. The cDNAs for chimeric molecules were constructed by the polymerase chain reaction and the overlap extension method (38Ho S.N. Hunt H.D. Horton R.M. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene. 1989; 77: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (6812) Google Scholar) using the cDNAs for SP-A and SP-D as the templates. The two primers used at the SP-A/SP-D splicing junctions were 5′-AACTGGTACCCAGGAGAGCCCAACAACAAT-3′ and 5′-ATTGTTGTTGGGCTCTCCTGGGTACCAGTT-3′ for chimera ad3; 5′-ATGATTGAAGACCAGACGGAGGGCAAGTTC-3′ and 5′-GAACTTGCCCTCCGTCTGGTCTTCAATCAT-3′ for chimera ad4; 5′-ACCATTAAAGAGATGTGCAGGCAGGCCGGA-3′ and 5′-TCCGGCCTGCCTGCACATCTCTTTAATGGT-3′ for chimera ad5. An SP-A sense and an SP-D antisense primers used were 5′-TCTAGAGAATTCTGTGGCAGAAGCCACTGG-3′ and 5′-TAACCCGGGGCTAAGCTCCTGGCCCAG-3′, respectively. The EcoRI and XmaI sites were incorporated into the flanking 5′ and 3′ primers, respectively. All of the constructions were inserted into pVL1392 plasmid vector using the EcoRI and XmaI sites. The recombinant plasmids constructed were confirmed by a combination of restriction enzyme mapping and DNA sequencing. The recombinant proteins were expressed in the baculovirus system using the methods described by O'Reilly et al. (39O'Reilly D.R. Miller L.K. Luckow V.A. Baculovirus Expression Vector. A Laboratory Manual. W. H. Freeman & Co., New York1992: 139-179Google Scholar). Monolayers ofSpodoptera frugiperda (Sf-9) cells were cotransfected with linearized virus DNA (BaculoGold, Phamingen) and the pVL 1392 plasmid vector containing the cDNAs for SP-A, SP-D, and the chimeras. Recombinant plaques were isolated and viral titers were amplified to approximately 5 × 107 to 5 × 108plaque-forming units/ml. The recombinant viruses were used to infect monolayers of Sf-9 cells in serum-free insect medium at a multiplicity of 2. The culture medium was then collected and dialyzed against 5 mm Tris buffer (pH 7.4) containing 0.15 m NaCl and 1 mm EDTA to remove monosaccharides. The culture medium was then applied to an affinity column of mannose-Sepharose 6B in the presence of 5 mm CaCl2. The recombinant proteins were eluted with 5 mm Tris buffer (pH 7.4) containing 10 mm EDTA. The purified recombinant proteins were dialyzed against 5 mm Tris buffer (pH 7.4) and stored at −20 °C. Protein concentrations were estimated by the method of Lowry et al. (40Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) using bovine serum albumin as the standard. SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was performed by the method of Laemmli (41Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206631) Google Scholar). Monoclonal antibodies were prepared against rat SP-A as described previously (42Kuroki Y. Mason R.J. Voelker D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 3388-3394Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The monoclonal antibodies recognized epitopes in the polypeptide portion of SP-A and had nearly equivalent affinity for the SP-A antigen. The epitopes for antibodies 1D6 and 6E3 have been identified to be located at the CRD and the neck domain, respectively (32Kuroki Y. McCormack F.X. Ogasawara Y. Mason R.J. Voelker D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29793-29800Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The binding of antibodies to SP-A, SP-D, or the chimeric proteins was examined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Aliquots of the purified proteins (50 μl, 1 μg/ml) in 5 mm Tris buffer (pH 7.4) were coated onto the microtiter wells and incubated with polyclonal antibody to SP-A or SP-D, or monoclonal antibody 1D6 or 6E3 (50 μl, 10 μg/ml) at 37 °C for 1 h after the nonspecific binding sites were blocked with phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100 and 3% (w/v) skim milk. The wells were washed and incubated with horseradish peroxidase-labeled anti-rabbit IgG or anti-mouse IgG. o-Phenylenediamine was used as the substrate for the peroxidase reaction. The antibody binding to the proteins was measured by absorbance at 492 nm. Phospholipids (1 μg/well) in 20 μl of ethanol were coated on microtiter wells and air-dried. After the nonspecific binding was blocked with 50 mm Tris buffer (pH 7.4) containing 0.15m NaCl, 5 mm CaCl2 and 2% (w/v) bovine serum albumin, various concentrations of SP-A or the chimeric proteins (0–20 μg/ml) were added and incubated for 1 h at room temperature. After the incubation, the wells were washed three times with ice-cold buffer of 50 mm Tris (pH 7.4) containing 0.15m NaCl, 5 mm CaCl2, and 1 mg/ml of bovine serum albumin. Monoclonal antibody 6E3 (10 μg/ml) was then added and incubated for 1 h, followed by the incubation with horseradish peroxidase-labeled anti-mouse IgG. The binding of the proteins to lipids was determined by measuring the absorbance at 492 nm using o-phenylenediamine as a substrate for the peroxidase reaction. The binding of SP-D to the lipids was examined in the same manner as described using anti-SP-D polyclonal antibody and horseradish peroxidase-labeled anti-rabbit IgG. DPPC, PI, or the lipid mixture composed of GalCer:PS:cholesterol (7:2:1, w/w/w) or GlcCer:PS:cholesterol (3:4:3, w/w/w) was dried under nitrogen and hydrated in 20 mm Tris buffer (pH 7.4) containing 0.1m NaCl at 37 °C for 1 h and vortexed vigorously for 5 min to prepare multilamellar liposomes. The protein solutions (0.2 μg/tube) were prepared in 50 μl of 20 mm Tris buffer (pH 7.4) containing 0.1 m NaCl, 5 mmCaCl2, and 20 mg/ml of bovine serum albumin (binding buffer). Then the multilamellar liposomes (100 μg) and the protein solutions were separately centrifuged at 12,000 rpm at room temperature for 10 min. The supernatant of the protein solution (50 μl) was added to the liposome pellet. The mixtures were suspended and incubated for 1 h at room temperature. The mixture was then put on ice for 15 min and then centrifuged at 12,000 rpm at 4 °C for 10 min. The supernatant was stored, and the resultant pellet was once washed with ice-cold binding buffer (50 μl/tube) and centrifuged again. The supernatant was then combined, and the pellet was suspended with 100 μl of the binding buffer. The amount of the proteins in each fraction was determined by competitive ELISA as described below. Liposome binding was defined as percentage of sedimentation (the proteins in pellet/the proteins in pellet plus supernatant × 100). Control experiments without liposomes were also performed. Because monoclonal antibody 6E3 binds all three chimeras to the same extent (see “Results”), we developed a competitive ELISA to determine the amount of chimeras in liposome pellets and the supernatants. The wild type (wt) recombinant SP-A (0.5 μg/ml, 100 μl/well) was coated onto microtiter wells. After the nonspecific binding was blocked with phosphate-buffered saline containing 3% (w/v) skim milk, 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100 (blocking buffer), the various dilutions of samples or standard wt SP-A (50 μl/well), and antibody 6E3 (1 μg/ml, 50 μl/well) were added to the wells and simultaneously incubated at 37 °C for 90 min. After the wells were washed, horseradish peroxidase-labeled anti-mouse IgG (1:1000, 100 μl/well) was added and incubated for 37 °C for 60 min. The peroxidase reaction was finally developed usingo-phenylenediamine and the absorbance was measured at 492 nm. To determine the amount of SP-D, wt SP-D (0.2 μg/ml) as the solid phase antigen, anti-SP-D polyclonal antibody (1 μg/ml), and anti-rabbit IgG were used instead of solid phase wt SP-A, antibody 6E3, and anti-mouse IgG, respectively. Liposome aggregation was performed by a modified method based on that described by Hawgood et al.(4Hawgood S. Benson B. Hamilton R.J. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 184-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). Unilamellar liposomes were prepared from the multilamellar liposomes composed of DPPC:egg phosphatidylcholine:phosphatidylglycerol (7:2:1, w/w/w) by probe sonication for 5 min. Unilamellar liposomes (200 μg/ml) and the purified proteins (20 or 80 μg/ml) in 20 mm Tris buffer (pH 7.4) containing 0.15 m NaCl were preincubated for 5 min. After equilibration, absorbance was measured at 400 nm using a Hitachi U-2000 spectrophotometer at room temperature. Following the initial absorbance reading, CaCl2 was added to a final concentration of 5 mm after 3 min, and the absorbance was further measured until a time of 10 min. Alveolar type II cells were isolated from the lungs of male Sprague-Dawley rats by tissue dissociation with elastase digestion and purification on metrizamide gradients (43Dobbs L.G. Mason R.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1979; 63: 378-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). Uptake of phospholipids by freshly isolated type II cells was performed by the method described by Wright et al. (9Wright J.R. Wager R.E. Hawgood S. Dobbs L. Clements J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 2888-2894Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, freshly isolated type II cells (2 × 106 cells) were incubated with radiolabeled phospholipid liposomes (100 μg/ml) composed of DPPC:egg phosphatidylcholine:phosphatidylglycerol (7:2:1, w/w/w) and a trace amount of [3H]DPPC, in the presence of the indicated amounts of proteins (5 or 20 μg/ml) at 37 °C for 1 h in 0.5 ml of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing Hepes (10 mm) (pH 7.4). Following the incubation, cells and media were separated by centrifugation at 1500 rpm for 5 min at 4 °C. The cells were resuspended with 1 ml of ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline containing 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin. The washing steps were repeated three times. Before the final centrifugation, the cell suspension was transferred to a fresh tube. The final cell pellet was analyzed for radioactivity. Type II cells (2 × 106 cells) were incubated overnight with [3H]choline (0.5 μCi/ml) in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum. Secretion of radiolabeled phosphatidylcholine was performed using 12-o-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) (10−7m) as the stimulant for the surfactant secretion and the purified proteins as antagonists, as described previously (42Kuroki Y. Mason R.J. Voelker D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 3388-3394Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Following a 3-h incubation, radiolabeled phospholipids were extracted from the cells and media, and counted. The lipid secretion from type II cells was expressed as percentage of secretion (radioactivity in medium/radioactivity in medium plus cells × 100). The binding of chimeras to type II cells was performed by determining the ability of chimeric proteins to compete with rat 125I-SP-A for receptor occupancy on alveolar type II cells, as described previously (12Kuroki Y. Mason R.J. Voelker D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 17596-17602Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 44McCormack F.X. Kuroki Y. Stewart J.J. Mason R.J. Voelker D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29801-29807Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, monolayers of freshly isolated type II cells (2 × 106/dish) were cultured overnight, and then were incubated with 0.5 μg/ml rat [125I]SP-A in the presence of 20 or 40 μg/ml unlabeled proteins for 3 h at 37 °C. The cells were washed four times on ice with 50 mm Tris buffer (pH 7.4) containing 0.1 m NaCl, 2 mm CaCl2, and 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin. The cells were then dissolved in 2 ml of 0.1 n NaOH and the radioactivity associated with the cells was determined using a γ-counter. Wild type SP-A, SP-D, and SP-A/SP-D chimeras were expressed using the baculovirus expression system. All three chimeras used in this study were purified by affinity chromatography using a matrix of mannose-Sepharose 6B. The preservation of lectin activity confirms a significant degree of fidelity in the protein folding. The purified recombinant proteins and native rat SP-A were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Native SP-A migrated as a triplet at 26, 32, and 38 kDa (Fig. 2 A, lane nat/A). In contrast, recombinant wt SP-A migrated as a broad band at 27–32 kDa under reducing conditions (Fig. 2 A, lane wt/A). The differences in molecular mass between native and recombinant protein is attributable to the differences in glycosylation between mammalian cells and insect cells and to the lack of hydroxylation of proline residues, as described previously (45McCormack F.X. Calvet H.M. Watson P.A. Smith D.L. Mason R.J. Voelker D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5833-5841Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The recombinant wild type SP-A retains all of the functions of its native counterpart (45McCormack F.X. Calvet H.M. Watson P.A. Smith D.L. Mason R.J. Voelker D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5833-5841Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). When analyzed under reducing conditions, SP-A/SP-D chimeras migrated as broad bands at 27–35 kDa (Fig. 2 A, lanes A/D chimeras 3–5). Analysis under nonreducing conditions revealed that the wild type SP-A and all of the chimeric molecules migrated as oligomers (Fig. 2 B, lanes A/D chimeras 3–5). Under nonreducing conditions the recombinant proteins (SP-A and SP-A/SP-D chimeras) showed significant levels of monomer that are a consequence of incomplete covalent oligomerization. wt SP-D migrated as a band at 43 kDa under reducing condition. wt SP-D appeared mainly as a monomer with smaller populations of oligomers under nonreducing conditions (Fig. 2,A and B, lanes wt/D), which is consistent with the result observed in the previous study (33Ogasawara Y. McCormack F.X. Mason R.J. Voelker D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29785-29792Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Previous studies revealed that the epitopes for anti-SP-A monoclonal antibodies 1D6 and 6E3 are located at the CRD and the neck domain, respectively (32Kuroki Y. McCormack F.X. Ogasawara Y. Mason R.J. Voelker D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29793-29800Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Antibody 1D6 has been reported to block the binding of SP-A to lipids, the SP-A-induced liposome aggregation, the SP-A-mediated lipid uptake into type II cells, the inhibitory activity of SP-A on lipid secretion, and the receptor binding (12Kuroki Y. Mason R.J. Voelker D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 17596-17602Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 32Kuroki Y. McCormack F.X. Ogasawara Y. Mason R.J. Voelker D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29793-29800Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Antibody 6E3 partially blocked SP-A-receptor interactions and completely blocked lipid uptake by alveolar type II cells. To examine whether monoclonal antibodies to SP-A recognized SP-A/SP-D chimeras, antibody binding to the purified proteins was measured by ELISA. Antibody 1D6 failed to bind to chimera ad3, ad4, or ad5 (Fig. 3). In contrast, antibody 6E3 bound to all of the chimeras, as well as to wild type SP-A. When monoclonal antibodies were tested for the reactivity to purified proteins applied to nitrocellulose membranes, the results were consistent with those obtained by ELISA (data not shown). Anti-SP-A polyclonal antibody bound to chimera ad3 at nearly one-half the level of that of wt SP-A, and it bound very weakly to chimerasad4 and ad5. Anti-SP-D polyclonal a"

We reexamined this issue in PB-responsive primary rat hepatocyte cultures using a broader array of protein synthesis inhibitors and experimental end points. Anisomycin, cycloheximide, emetine, puromycin, and puromycin aminonucleoside, a negative analog, were evaluated for their respective effects on protein synthesis and the PB-induction process. All of the inhibitors effectively repressed de novo protein synthesis in the cells in a concentration-dependent manner. However, anisomycin only minimally effected PB induction, ascertained though the measure of CYP2B1, CYP2B2, and CYP3A1 mRNA levels. The inactive agent, puromycin aminonucleoside, produced marked repression of the PB-induction response. Results from further experiments demonstrated that these protein synthesis inhibitors stimulated rapid and differential phosphorylation of the stress-activated protein kinase/c-Jun kinase (SAPK/JNK) pathway, indicating nonselective actions on cellular processes. Puromycin aminonucleoside was without effect on these pathways, despite its efficacy as an inhibitor of PB induction. These results demonstrate that de novo protein synthesis is not a requirement for PB induction, nor is activation of the SAPK/JNK kinase cascade responsible for down-regulating PB responsiveness in primary hepatocytes.

Phenobarbital (PB) 1The abbreviations used are: PB, phenobarbital; CYP, cytochome P450; SAPK, stress-activated protein kinase; JNK, c-Jun kinase. 1The abbreviations used are: PB, phenobarbital; CYP, cytochome P450; SAPK, stress-activated protein kinase; JNK, c-Jun kinase. is well recognized for its pleiotropic effects on mammalian cells, including its ability to transcriptionally activate a variety of genes (1Waxman D.J. Azaroff L. Biochem. J. 1992; 281: 577-592Crossref PubMed Scopus (530) Google Scholar, 2Hardwick J.P. Gonzalez F.J. Kasper C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 8081-8085Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, identification of the molecular mechanisms controlling these inductive responses has proven difficult. Certain cytochome P450s (CYP), including the rat CYP2B1 and CYP2B2 genes, are highly responsive to PB in liver hepatocytes, and provide excellent models for mechanistic studies of the induction process (1Waxman D.J. Azaroff L. Biochem. J. 1992; 281: 577-592Crossref PubMed Scopus (530) Google Scholar, 3Omiecinski C.J. Walz Jr., F.G. Vlasuk G.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3247-3250Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). PB and other PB-like inducers do not share obvious structural homology or chemical enantioselectivity (4Nims R.W. Sidhu J.S. Thomas P.E. Mellini D.W. Nelson V.C. Omiecinski C.J. Lubet R.A. J. Biochem. Toxicol. 1994; 9: 279-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar), as typically associated with classical receptor-mediated gene activation responses. Using a highly differentiated hepatocyte culture system, we previously provided evidence for involvement of distinct intracellular signaling pathways that act in concert to modulate PB induction. Elevation of intracellular cAMP/protein kinase A associated activity by physiological hormones, or other protein kinase A activators, completely repressed induction (5Sidhu J.S. Omiecinski C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12762-12773Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), implying a negative modulatory role for this pathway. Recently, we demonstrated that inhibition of a PP1/PP2A protein phosphatase pathway also effectively suppressed the PB-induction response (6Sidhu J.S. Omiecinski C.J. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1997; 282: 1122-1129PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, the latter pathway may serve as a positive signaling intermediate in the induction process. These results led us to hypothesize that a dephosphorylation event is a required trigger, upstream of PB-mediated transcriptional activation. In potential conflict with this line of reasoning, results of earlier studies have led some to conclude that another, distinct control mechanism is involved in PB induction. For example, Burger et al. (7Burger H.-J. Schuetz E.G. Schuetz J.D. Guzelian P.S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1990; 281: 204-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) proposed a requirement for de novo protein synthesis in the induction of rat CYP2B gene expression. This conclusion was based on the 46% inhibition of PB-inducible CYP2B1/2 mRNA expression following treatment of primary hepatocytes with 10 μm cycloheximide. In contrast, PB-inducibleCYP3A1 gene expression was enhanced 2–19-fold in this study by cycloheximide. These results were interpreted to indicate that PB-mediated intracellular signaling displayed divergence in its mode of induction of the CYP2B versus the CYP3A gene family members. A report by Dogra et al. (8Dogra S.C. Hahn C.N. May B.K. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 300: 531-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) indicated thatin vivo injections of cycloheximide treatment alone activated the levels of PB-inducible CYP2H1 mRNA in chick embryo livers. In fact, these authors demonstrated that coadministration of cycloheximide and PB resulted in a superinduction of theCYP2H1 gene, similar effects to that observed with the dioxin-inducible CYP1A1 gene (9Teilfeld R.M. Fagan J.B. Pasco D.S. DNA (N. Y.). 1989; 8: 329-338PubMed Google Scholar, 10Lusska A. Wu L. Whitlock Jr., J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 15146-15151Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These findings imply that a labile repressor protein is involved in modulating PB-inducible gene expression in the chicken. Honkakoski et al. (11Honkakoski P. Moore R. Gynther J. Negishi M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9746-9753Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar) used 10 μm cycloheximide treatment of primary mouse hepatocyte cultures and reported that this regimen was ineffective on theCyp2b10 PB induction status. The latter results suggest that the PB-induction process in the mouse involves a preexisting pathway, and does not require de novo protein synthesis (12Honkakoski P. Negishi M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14943-14949Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). In the current investigation, we attempted to more fully characterize the potential role of de novo protein synthesis in PB induction. Using a well characterized primary rat hepatocyte culture model, we conducted concentration-effect studies for a broad range of protein synthesis inhibitors, and for an inactive analog, puromycin aminonucleoside. Despite its lack of effect on de novoprotein synthesis, the latter agent produced dose-dependent repression of PB induction. Dose-response analyses with the active protein synthesis inhibitors revealed the lack of consistent correlation between extent of protein synthesis inhibition and repression of PB induction. With the exception of puromycin aminonucleoside, all of the protein synthesis inhibitors tested were potent activators of the stress-activated signal transduction pathway (SAPK/JNK) pathway, demonstrating a lack of specificity of these commonly used inhibitors. We conclude that, in rat hepatocytes, there is no requirement for de novo protein synthesis in the PB induction of CYP mRNA expression. Unless otherwise stated, all cell culture media and TrizolTM (RNA isolation reagent) were obtained from Life Technologies Inc. MatrigelTM, ITS+ (insulin, transferrin, selenium, bovine serum albumin and linoleic acid) and Nu-SerumTM were obtained from Collaborative Biomedical Products (Bedford, MA). Leucine-free Dulbecco's modified Ealge's medium/F-12 medium was purchased from Sigma. Tissue culture-treated plastic flasks (75 cm2) were from Falcon (Franklin Lakes, NJ).3H-Labeled leucine was purchased from NEN Life Science Products. Anisomycin, cycloheximide, emetine, puromycin, puromycin aminonucleoside, and dexamethasone (9α-fluoro-16α-methyl-11β,17α,21-trihydroxy-1,4-pregnadiene-3,20-dione) were obtained from Sigma, as were all other unspecified chemicals (of the highest grade possible). The phospho-specific SAPK/JNK antibody kit was from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA). Rat hepatocytes were isolated by a modification of the two-step collagenase perfusionin situ (13Seglen P. Methods Biol. 1976; 13: 433-447Google Scholar) and cultured with a modification (14Sidhu J.S. Farin F.M. Kavanagh T.J. Omiecinski C.J. In Vitro Toxicol. 1994; 7: 225-242PubMed Google Scholar, 15Sidhu J.S. Omiecinski C.J. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1996; 276: 238-245PubMed Google Scholar) of the protocol described previously (16Sidhu J.S. Farin F.M. Omiecinski C.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 301: 103-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Anisomycin and cycloheximide were dissolved in Me2SO as stock solutions (20 mm) and stored at −20 °C. Emetine, puromycin, and puromycin aminonucleoside were dissolved in tissue culture-grade water as stock solutions (20 mm) and stored as aliquots at −20 °C. Unless otherwise stated, cells were cultured for 48 h prior to addition of inhibitor or vehicle (Me2SO or tissue culture-grade water) alone. Cells were treated with increasing concentrations of the various protein synthesis inhibitors for 30–60 min prior to the addition of PB (500 μm). Unless otherwise stated, all inducer treatments were conducted for 24 h, at which point total RNA was isolated. Representative data are presented from multiple studies performed independently with different hepatocyte preparations. Total RNA was isolated (17Chomczynski P. Saachi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63082) Google Scholar) using TrizolTM as described elsewhere (15Sidhu J.S. Omiecinski C.J. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1996; 276: 238-245PubMed Google Scholar) from cells pooled from one 75-cm2 flask for each treatment and analyzed as described previously (15Sidhu J.S. Omiecinski C.J. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1996; 276: 238-245PubMed Google Scholar, 18Sidhu J.S. Omiecinski C.J. Pharmacogenetics. 1995; 5: 24-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Primary hepatocytes were cultured for 48 h. Prior to measurement of protein synthesis, cells were washed withl-leucine-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 medium (Sigma) supplemented with l-glutamine,l-lysine, l-methionine, CaCl2, MgCl2, MgSO4, NaHCO3, phenol red, ITS+, penicillin, streptomycin, and 25 nm dexamethasone. Cells were subsequently returned to the incubator in this same medium for a further 60 min. Protein synthesis was assessed by the ability of the cells to incorporate l-[3H]leucine (0.5 μCi/ml) in the presence or absence of increasing concentrations (0.01–25 μm) of the various protein synthesis inhibitors. Unless otherwise stated, leucine incorporation was evaluated for a 1-h pulse at 37 °C. Following the pulse, medium was removed, and the cells were washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline to remove unincorporated label. Cells were harvested by scraping into 5 ml of ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline with a cell scraper (Nunc, Naperville, IL). After centrifugation (50 × g for 5 min, at 4 °C), 1 ml of ice-cold 10% trichloroacetic acid was added to the pellets. The resulting lysate was placed on ice for a further 30 min. Subsequently, 300 μl of this total extract were spotted, under vacuum, onto a prewetted (10% trichloroacetic acid) glass filter (no. 32, Schleicher & Schuell). The filters were washed three times with 1 ml of 10% trichloroacetic acid followed by twice with 1 ml of 95% ethanol and then dried under a vacuum. Filter-bound radioactivity was measured by liquid scintillation spectroscopy (Beckman LS3801) after the addition of 5 ml of scintillation solution (Ecoscint A, National Diagnostics, Atlanta, GA). We examined the ability of the various protein synthesis inhibitors to activate the SAPK/JNK kinase pathway. Cells were cultured for 72 h prior to start of treatments with 10 μm of the various protein synthesis inhibitors for a period of 5–60 min (short term) or 1–24 h (long term). Controlled time points were taken as follows: cells were washed twice with 5 ml of ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline followed by the addition of 1.5 ml of ice-cold cell lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm Na2EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1% Triton, 2.5 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1 mmsodium ortho-vanadate, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 47.9 μg/ml 4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluoride, and 15.7 μg/ml benzamidine). Cells were harvested by scraping in cell lysis buffer and then were placed on ice. Subsequently, all extracts were homogenized by a brief sonication pulse and then centrifuged (16,000 ×g, 10 min, 4 °C) to remove insoluble material. The resulting supernatant (cell extract) was carefully removed, and total protein was determined (BCA reagent kit, Pierce). Equal quantities of cell extracts (20 μg) were separated via SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis on a Mini-Protean II 10% Tris-HCl precast gel (Bio-Rad) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Proteins were subsequently transferred onto Immobilon-P membranes (Millipore, Bedford, MA) for immunoblot analyses. The membranes were probed (manufacturer's blotting instructions) with a phosphorylation-specific antibody (1:1000 dilution), which recognizes SAPK/JNK only when phosphorylated at the Thr-183/Tyr-185 residues and a control SAPK/JNK antibody (phosphorylation state-independent, 1:1000 dilution) to normalize for protein loading. The membranes were then incubated with a goat anti-rabbit-horseradish peroxidase conjugated secondary antibody (1:2000 dilution) and an horseradish pereoxidase-conjugated anti-biotin antibody (1:1000 dilution) to detect biotinylated protein markers. The Phototope-HP (New England Biolabs) chemiluminescence system was used to visualize specific immunoreactive proteins. Various inhibitors were examined for their ability to inhibit de novo protein synthesis in cultures of primary rat hepatocytes. Cells were treated with increasing concentrations of inhibitors for 30–60 min prior to the addition of [3H]leucine. Following an additional 60-min incubation, protein synthesis activity was assessed by the measure of label incorporation. With the exception of the inactive analog of puromycin, puromycin aminonucleoside, all the inhibitors effected a concentration-dependent inhibition ofde novo protein synthesis (Fig. 1). The relative potency of inhibition is in the order: emetine > anisomycin > cycloheximide > puromycin, with the last named agent exhibiting only marginal inhibition at a concentration of 1 μm. In fact, 90–95% inhibition of protein synthesis was achieved only with emetine and anisomycin, at 10 μm concentrations. Cycloheximide and puromycin exerted only 80% and 60% inhibition, respectively, at a similar concentration. Puromycin aminonucleoside was without effect onde novo protein synthesis at all concentrations examined. After establishing the concentration-effect relationships for the various inhibitors and the inactive analog, we next examined the efficacy of these agents as modulators of PB-inducible CYP gene expression. Hepatocytes were treated for 60 min with the same concentration range of inhibitors and then continuously in the absence (control) or presence (500 μm) of PB for a total of 24 h before RNA harvest. The results of RNA slot-blot hybridization analyses are presented in Fig. 2, A and B. Anisomycin treatment of primary hepatocytes resulted in only partial inhibition of PB induction of CYP2B and CYP3A1gene expression. When the induction of CYP2B1 was normalized to ribosomal 18 S RNA (Fig. 2 C), only 65% inhibition was effected at 10 μm anisomycin. The identical concentration of this agent produced >95% inhibition of de novo protein synthesis. In contrast, at a similar concentration, cycloheximide was a more effective inhibitor of PB induction (100% inhibition) than ofde novo protein synthesis (80% inhibition). Further contrasting results were obtained with puromycin and its inactive analog, puromycin aminonucleoside. Puromycin was markedly more potent than both anisomycin and cycloheximide as an inhibitor of PB-inducibleCYP2B1/2 and CYP3A1 gene expression, and yet was least potent with respect to inhibition of de novo protein synthesis. This conclusion was most evident when comparing the 5% inhibition of protein synthesis obtained at 1 μmpuromycin versus the approximately 95% inhibition of CYP2B1 induction. Surprisingly, puromycin aminonucleoside also produced a parallel and dramatic concentration-dependent inhibition of PB induction, despite being completely ineffective as a protein synthesis inhibitor. With respect to its potency, puromycin aminonucleoside was less effective than either cycloheximide or puromycin at inhibiting the PB-induction process, but considerably more potent than anisomycin. Cycloheximide and puromycin treatments resulted in only modest alterations of albumin mRNA expression levels. We also examined the effects of these agents following a shorter time of exposure. Hepatocytes were treated for a total period of 8 h with either 10 μm of anisomycin, emetine, cycloheximide, puromycin, puromycin aminonucleoside, or 25 μm of anisomycin, puromycin, or puromycin aminonucleoside. Total RNA was isolated and analyzed by slot-blot RNA hybridization. As presented in Fig. 3 A, PB induction was completely inhibited only by cycloheximide. In fact, when levels of CYP2B1 mRNA expression were normalized to 18 S (Fig. 3 B), a differential inhibition of PB induction was noted again, a repression character that exhibited little correlation with the extent of protein synthesis inhibition. It was noteworthy that both concentrations of puromycin aminonucleoside examined here were equally as suppressive of the PB-induction response as puromycin itself. After noting the differential effects of protein synthesis inhibitors on PB-mediated CYP gene expression, we questioned the specificity of these agents. In particular, we hypothesized that these substances were effecting other intracellular pathways, independent of their inhibitory properties on de novoprotein synthesis. We tested this hypothesis by examining the ability of the inhibitors to stimulate phosphorylation of the SAPK/JNK kinase (p46 and p54 kinases) cascade. Primary hepatocytes were treated with 10 μm concentrations of the protein synthesis inhibitors for time periods ranging from 5 min to 24 h, after which total cell extracts were prepared. The results of Western blot immunoanalyses of differential phosphorylation of the p46 and p54 kinases (SAPK/JNK) between 5 and 60 min are presented in Fig. 4 A (panels a,c, and e). These results were normalized to the corresponding levels of immunoreactive p46 and p54 proteins (panels b, d, and f) and are graphically represented in Fig. 4 B. Normalized signal values are expressed as relative phosphorylation (arbitrary units)in Fig. 4 B. Cells treated with Me2SO (control) alone exhibited no observable phosphorylation of this cascade. However, when cells were treated with anisomycin, a rapid and time-dependent increase resulted in phosphorylation of both p46 and p54 SAPK/JNK kinases (Fig. 4 B). Concomitant phosphorylation of the c-Jun transcription factor also was observed (data not shown). Longer exposures (2–24 h) resulted in a complete reversion of the stimulation back to control levels (data not shown). We also noted a differential stimulation of the SAPK/JNK cascade with the other inhibitors. Cycloheximide was more effective in stimulating phosphorylation of the cascade than either emetine or puromycin (Fig. 4 B). Puromycin exhibited only marginal stimulation after 60 min. However, puromycin aminonucleoside was completely ineffective at stimulating SAPK phosphorylation (Fig. 4 A). In addition, epidermal growth factor treatment, which produced a marked transient stimulation of p42/p44 mitogen-activated protein kinase phosphorylation (data not shown) did not activate SAPK/JNK phosphorylation. Similarly, PB treatment itself was without effect on resulting phosphorylation levels of either kinase cascade (data not shown). In this investigation we used four distinct inhibitors of de novo protein synthesis to more carefully ascertain the role ofde novo synthesis on the PB-induction process. These analyses were conducted in a well characterized primary rat hepatocyte model, assessing PB-inducible CYP gene expression as a major end point. Our results demonstrated a potent concentration-dependent inhibition of de novo protein synthesis by these agents and a corresponding but differential inhibition of PB-inducible CYP gene expression. In the results obtained by Burger et al. (7Burger H.-J. Schuetz E.G. Schuetz J.D. Guzelian P.S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1990; 281: 204-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), 10 μm cycloheximide treatment produced only 46% inhibition of PB-inducible CYP2B gene expression, while PB induction ofCYP3A1 gene expression was actually elevated 2–19-fold. The authors postulated that PB exhibits a distinct divergence in its mode of induction of the CYP2B and CYP3A gene family members. In our system, 8 h of 10 μm cycloheximide exposure resulted in nearly complete inhibition of PB induction, at both the CYP2B and CYP3A locus. In addition, all of the additional protein synthesis inhibitors tested resulted in a parallel inhibition of PB-induced CYP2B and CYP3A mRNA expression. In general, we noted differential effects with these agents between their relative percent inhibition of protein synthesis and PB-inducible gene expression. This was especially clear with anisomycin and puromycin, the most and least potent inhibitors of protein synthesis, respectively, while exhibiting converse effects on the relative degree of inhibition of PB induction. These results, coupled with the finding that 10 μm puromycin aminonucleoside, a puromycin analog devoid of any protein synthesis inhibitory activity (19Chow S.C. Peters I. Orrenius S. Exp. Cell Res. 1995; 216: 149-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) (data herein), produced largely complete inhibition of the PB-induction process, raises serious issue with the tenet that de novo protein synthesis is a requirement in the PB-mediated signaling process (7Burger H.-J. Schuetz E.G. Schuetz J.D. Guzelian P.S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1990; 281: 204-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar,20Chianale J. Mulholland L. Traber P.G. Gumuchio J.J. Hepatology. 1988; 8: 327-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Our results are consistent with those from Negishi and co-workers (11Honkakoski P. Moore R. Gynther J. Negishi M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9746-9753Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar), who reported no observable effect of cycloheximide treatment on the accumulation of the PB-inducible mouse Cyp2b10 mRNA (21Honkakoski P.

However, the latter as well as previous investigations of this issue all failed to provide 1) any measures of concentration effect on the induction process, 2) measure of the relative efficacy of their test inhibitors on de novo protein synthesis, or 3) use of any negative analogs. Typically, past conclusions regarding the requirement ofde novo protein synthesis for the PB-induction process were made on the basis of a single in vivo injection (20Chianale J. Mulholland L. Traber P.G. Gumuchio J.J. Hepatology. 1988; 8: 327-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 22Nirodi C.S. Sultana S. Ram N. Prabhu L. Padmanaban G. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1996; 331: 79-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), or single concentrations of an inhibitor in cultures of primary hepatocytes (7Burger H.-J. Schuetz E.G. Schuetz J.D. Guzelian P.S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1990; 281: 204-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). To assess the specificity of the inhibitors, and whether the inhibitors affected other intracellular signaling processes independent of their action on protein synthesis, we examined the SAPK/JNK cascade. Previous studies established that the SAPK/JNK cascade is potently activated by agents such as anisomycin and puromycin (23Shu J. Hitomi M. Stacey D. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 2421-2430PubMed Google Scholar, 24Iordanov M.S. Pribnow D. Magun J.L. Dinh T.-H. Pearson J.A. Chen S.L.-Y. Magun B.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 3373-3381Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Our data establish, for the first time, the differential phosphorylation of the enzymes involved in this pathway consequent to hepatocyte exposure to protein synthesis inhibitors. Anisomycin was clearly the most potent SAPK/JNK activator. Puromycin, despite being the most effective inhibitor of PB induction, was the least effective modulator of SAPK/JNK phosphorylation. Puromycin aminonucleoside, although highly effective in inhibiting PB induction, was completely ineffective in activating SAPK/JNK phosphorylation. We conclude, therefore, that activation of the SAPK/JNK cascade is not a signaling pathway involved in PB induction. Rather, it appears that inhibitors of protein synthesis exert a nonspecific modulation of PB induction that is quite independent of their ability to disrupt protein synthesis or effect the SAPK/JNK cascade. The exact pathway(s) affected by these agents that modulate the PB-induction process remain to be determined. One could speculate that if de novo protein synthesis was indeed a critical mode of regulating the PB-induction process, then striking differences would result in the relative DNA-binding patterns with nuclear proteins isolated from control and PB-induced extracts. Trottier et al. (25Trottier E. Belzil A. Stoltz C. Anderson A. Gene (Amst.). 1995; 158: 263-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar) examined electrophoretic mobility shift assay complexes and observed that signals from complexes C1 to C3 were similar with nuclear extracts from PB-treated than untreated rat liver. In a recent study (12Honkakoski P. Negishi M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14943-14949Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar), establishing the role of a 177-base pair activator region in the 5′ region of the PB-inducible mouseCyp2b10 gene, Negishi and co-workers detected no differences in protein binding patterns from untreated or PB-treated nuclear extracts with any of the sequences identified as important in PB regulation. We reported similar results using extracts from control and PB-induced nuclei and their interaction with the proximal promoter region of the CYP2B1 and CYP2B2 genes (26Sommer K.M. Ramsden R. Sidhu J.S. Costa P. Omiecinski C.J. Pharmacogenetics. 1996; 6: 369-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Our recent studies examining the role of cAMP/protein kinase A activators and PP1/PP2A inhibitors in the PB-signaling process indicate that an upstream phosphatase pathway may participate as an activator of PB induction. The dependence on critical phosphorylation/dephosphorylation events is a well characterized phenomenon regulating enzymatic activities as well as the transcriptional status of many genes (27Wegner M. Cao Z. Rosenfeld M.G. Science. 1992; 256: 370-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar, 28Reifel-Miller A.E. Calnek D.S. Grinnel B.W. J. Biol.

In summary, we interpret our data to indicate that PB induction of CYP mRNA expression in rat hepatocytes is likely to signal through preexisting phosphatase-regulated factors and therefore does not require a de novo protein synthesis event. The precise pathways involved in this process remain to be identified. We gratefully acknowledge the technical assistance of Diane Wing."

Pro-MPO goes through a stepwise proteolytic trimming with elimination of an amino-terminal propeptide to yield one heavy and one light polypeptide chain. The propeptide of MPO may have a role in retention and folding of the nascent protein into its tertiary structure or in targeting of pro-MPO for processing and storage in granules. A propeptide-deleted pro-MPO mutant (MPOΔpro) was constructed to determine if deletion of the propeptide interferes with processing and targeting after transfection to the myeloid 32D cell line. Transfection of full-length cDNA for human MPO results in normal processing and targeting of MPO to cytoplasmic dense organelles. Although the efficiency of incorporation was lower for MPOΔpro, both pro-MPO and MPOΔpro showed heme incorporation indicating that the propeptide is not critical for this process. Deletion of the propeptide results in synthesis of a protein that lacks processing into mature two-chain forms but rather is degraded intracellularly or secreted. The finding of continued degradation of MPOΔpro in the presence of lysosomotrophic agents or brefeldin A rules out that the observed degradation takes place after transfer to granules. Intracellular pro-MPO has high mannose oligosaccharide side chains, whereas stored mature MPO was found to have both high mannose and complex oligosaccharide side chains as judged by only partial sensitivity to endoglycosidase H. The propeptide may normally interfere with the generation of certain complex oligosaccharide chain(s) supported by the finding of high mannose side chains in secreted pro-MPO and lack of them in MPOΔpro that contained complex oligosaccharide side chains only. In conclusion, elimination of the propeptide of pro-MPO blocks the maturation process and abolishes accumulation of the final product in granules suggesting a critical role of the propeptide for late processing of pro-MPO and targeting for storage in granules.

Neutrophil granulocytes are specialized for a role in host defense. A regulated pathway targets enzymes and antibiotic proteins to a storage compartment in these cells consisting of cytoplasmic azurophil, specific, and gelatinase granules formed sequentially, whereas a constitutive pathway exports proteins to the cell surface (1Gullberg U. Andersson E. Garwicz D. Lindmark A. Olsson I. Eur. J. Haematol. 1997; 58: 137-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Azurophil granules are thought to be specialized lysosomes, and their protein constituents are often subject to posttranslational glycosylation and proteolytic trimming similar to that of lysosomal enzymes (2Hasilik A. Experientia (Basel). 1992; 48: 130-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). A retention mechanism may be necessary to avoid constitutive secretion of granule proteins, and a condensation mechanism is necessary for efficient packaging. Signals for targeting storage in granules have been sought within the structure of neutrophil granule proteins. For instance, a pro-region segment is necessary for targeting to granules of neutrophil defensins (3Liu L. Ganz T. Blood. 1995; 85: 1095-1103Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), but carboxyl-terminal prodomains or asparagine-linked carbohydrates of hematopoietic serine proteases are not required in targeting storage in granules (4Gullberg U.

Pro-MPO undergoes extensive processing, including the removal of an amino-terminal propeptide not found in mature MPO. Therefore, in this work we have investigated whether the propeptide of MPO has a role in intracellular trafficking and targeting to granules. The processing steps for MPO are shown in Fig. 1. Mature MPO is a 150-kDa tetramer composed of two glycosylated 59–64-kDa heavy subunits and two unglycosylated 14-kDa light subunits as a pair of protomers linked together by a disulfide bond (7Nauseef W. Olsson I. Arnljots K. Eur. J. Haematol. 1988; 40: 97-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Each heavy subunit carries a covalently bound heme prosthetic group (8Andrews P.C. Krinsky N.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 4211-4218Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), although the crystal structure of canine MPO suggests that heme of the intact molecule associates with both subunits (9Zeng J. Fenna R.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 226: 185-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). The primary translation product undergoes cotranslational glycosylation with production of 89-kDa heme-free apopro-MPO followed by incorporation of heme and conversion into enzymatically active pro-MPO (7Nauseef W. Olsson I. Arnljots K. Eur. J. Haematol. 1988; 40: 97-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Processing and maturation of pro-MPO is a slow process (10Olsson I. Persson A.-M. Strömberg K. Biochem. J. 1984; 223: 911-920Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) that can be accomplished only after acquisition of heme (11Nauseef W.M. McCormick S. Yi H.

Calreticulin, a calcium-binding protein that resides in the ER, has been suggested to function as a molecular chaperone and facilitate the critical folding of apopro-MPO to allow insertion of heme followed by conversion to pro-MPO (14Nauseef W.M. McCormick S.J. Clark R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4741-4747Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). The stepwise processing of pro-MPO has been investigated in myeloid cells (10Olsson I. Persson A.-M. Strömberg K. Biochem. J. 1984; 223: 911-920Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar,15Yamada M.

Blood. 1987; 70: 1143-1150Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and the results obtained are consistent with those later deduced from cDNA sequence data. Thus, during subsequent processing of pro-MPO the amino-terminal propeptide, a small peptide between the light and heavy chains, and a single serine residue at the carboxyl-terminal are removed (21Hashinaka K. Nishio C. Hur S.-J. Sakiyama F. Tsunasawa S. Yamada M. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 5906-5914Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Intermediate processing forms have been observed with molecular masses of 81 and 74 kDa (10Olsson I. Persson A.-M. Strömberg K. Biochem. J. 1984; 223: 911-920Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 18Koeffler H.P. Ranyard J. Pertcheck M. Blood. 1984; 65: 484-491Crossref Google Scholar, 19Akin D.T. Kinkade Jr., J.M. J. Biol.

Biophys. 1987; 255: 428-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) of which the smaller can be converted directly into mature MPO after cleavage between the heavy and the light subunit (19Akin D.T. Kinkade Jr., J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 8370-8375Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22Akin D.T. Kinkade J.M. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1987; 255: 428-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). This finding suggests that the amino-terminal propeptide, which does not seem to be part of the 74-kDa form, is removed during an intermediate step before final processing. One can envision a role for the amino-terminal propeptide of MPO in retention and folding of the nascent protein into its tertiary structure or in targeting pro-MPO to pregranule structures for further processing and storage in granules. A propeptide-deleted pro-MPO mutant (MPOΔpro) was constructed to determine if propeptide deletion interferes with processing and targeting. In this work, we describe the consequences of these manipulations for posttranslational processing, intracellular sorting, and constitutive secretion after transfection of the cDNA for MPO and MPOΔpro into the murine myeloid 32D clone 3 cell line. The eucaryotic expression vector pCDNA 3 was from Invitrogen, British Biotechnology, Oxon, UK. The vector provides a cytomegalovirus promoter-driven expression of introduced cDNA. The plasmid also confers resistance to geneticin, allowing selection of recombinant cells. [35S]Methionine/[35S]cysteine (cell labeling grade) was from Amersham International (Buckinghamshire, UK). δ-[4-14C]Aminolevulinic acid hydrochloride ([4-14C]ALA) was from DuPont, Belgium. Prior to use, [4-14C]ALA was concentrated 10-fold in a vacuum centrifuge and pH adjusted with NaOH. Percoll and protein A-Sepharose CL-4B were from Pharmacia (Uppsala, Sweden). Protein G-Sepharose was from Sigma. Geneticin, N-glycosidase F (N-glycanase) and endoglycosidase H (Endo-H) were from Boehringer Mannheim (Mannheim, Federal Republic of Germany). Brefeldin A (BFA), a gift from Sandoz AB, was dissolved in methanol and stored at −20 °C. A partial cDNA clone encoding approximately 80% of human prepro-MPO was obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (clone pMP503, ATCC 57694). This clone lacks the coding region for the amino-terminal part of the protein. To obtain a full-length clone for transfection studies, an approximate 500-base pair fragment, originating from the 5′ end of the mRNA, was isolated by PCR amplification. This fragment was isolated by using one primer directed against a region starting approximately 80 base pairs upstream of the start codon and a second primer directed against a region just downstream of a single XbaI site present in the 5′ end of the clone pMP503 (in the coding region of the clone). The PCR fragment was cloned as an RsaI/XbaI fragment, and the entire nucleotide sequence was determined for two separate clones. One of the clones was found to have an identical sequence to that for MPO. To obtain the full-length MPO clone, two separate fragments were ligated into the vector pcDNAIneo, oneXbaI/EcoRI fragment originating from the pMP503 clone and one HindIII/XbaI fragment from the PCR clone. After sequence analysis of 5′ and 3′ ends of the resulting clone and restriction mapping for a panel of internal sites, this clone was used for the subsequent transfection studies and as starting material for the construction of the MPOΔpro. For site-directed mutagenesis cDNA of human MPO (pcDNA1neo/MPO) was used as template in a two-step “spliced overhang extension” polymerase chain reaction in the following way. In the first reaction two separate amplifications with 100 ng of DNA template in a 20-cycle PCR produced two fragments of myeloperoxidase positioned amino-terminally and carboxyl-terminally of the propeptide (Pro43-Gly164), respectively (Fig. 2). By design of the primers, the “Kozak” consensus leader sequence for maximum translational efficiency was introduced 5′ to the ATG initiation codon, and the flanking restriction enzyme sites HindIII and BamHI were included for subsequent cloning into plasmid. The PCR primers in the two amplifications were upstream 5′-GACTTCAAGCTTGCCACCATGGGGGTTCCCTTCTTCTCT-3′ (primer 1) plus downstream 5′-CGGGCAAGTCACCCCCACGTCGGGCTGGGGCGTGGCCAGAAT-3′ (primer 2), and upstream 5′-GACGTGGGGGTGACTTGCCCG-3′ (primer 3) plus downstream 5′-CTTCAGGGATCC CTAGGAGGCTTCCCTCCAGGA-3′ (primer 4), respectively (start and stop codons in boldface and restriction enzyme sites underlined). The PCR products were isolated on agarose gel, mixed, and subjected to a second 20-cycle splicing PCR amplification with primers 1 and 4, thus creating MPO lacking the propeptide (MPOΔpro). The resulting PCR product was digested byHindIII and BamHI, followed by isolation on agarose gel and cloning into plasmid (pcDNA3) to create the expression vector pcDNA3/MPOΔpro. All PCRs were performed in a Perkin-Elmer 480 Thermal Cycler usingPfu polymerase (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. 32D clone 3 cells (23Valtieri M. Tweardy D.J.

Rovera (Philadelphia, PA) were grown in complete medium consisting of Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum and 30% WEHI-conditioned medium as a source of interleukin 3 (25Kreider B.L.

The cell cultures were kept in 5% CO2 at 37 °C in a fully humidified atmosphere. Exponentially growing cells were used in all experiments. 32D cells were transfected with pcDNA1neo/MPO and pcDNA3/MPOΔpro using the Bio-Rad Electroporation Apparatus (Bio-Rad) with electrical settings of 960 microfarads and 300 V as described previously (5Garwicz D. Lindmark A. Gullberg U. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28413-28418Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Forty-eight hours after electroporation, geneticin (1 mg/ml) was added to select for recombinant clones expressing the geneticin resistance of pcDNA 3. Individual clones growing in the presence of antibiotic were isolated, expanded into mass cultures, and screened by biosynthetic radiolabeling for expression of the protein encoded by the transfected cDNA. Clones with the most pronounced expression were chosen for further experiments. Biosynthetic radiolabeling of newly synthesized proteins was performed as described (26Gullberg U. Lindmark A. Nilsson E. Persson A.-M. Olsson I. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25219-25225Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were starved for 30 min in methionine/cysteine-free medium, followed by radiolabeling with 15 or 30 μCi/ml [35S]methionine/[35S]cysteine for 30 or 60 min. In experiments with [4-14C]ALA labeling, cells were incubated with 25 μCi/ml for 3 h for radiolabeling. In chase experiments, following radiolabeling, cells were resuspended in complete medium. At timed intervals, cells were withdrawn and lysed or homogenized for subcellular fractionation. Subcellular fractionation was performed as described (26Gullberg U. Lindmark A. Nilsson E. Persson A.-M. Olsson I. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25219-25225Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, the postnuclear cell homogenate was fractionated in a Percoll density gradient, after which nine fractions were collected with all cytosol in fraction 9. The distribution of lysosomes and Golgi elements in the density gradient was determined by assaying β-hexosaminidase and β-galactosyltransferase as described elsewhere (27Hultberg B. Lindsten J. Sjöblad S. Biochem. J. 1976; 155: 599-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 28Bretz R. Stäubli W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1977; 77: 181-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Peak activities of β-hexosaminidase and galactosyltransferase were localized in fractions 2 and 6, respectively (data not shown). For immunoprecipitation, whole cells or Percoll-containing subcellular fractions were solubilized, and biosynthetically radiolabeled MPO or MPOΔpro was precipitated with polyclonal anti-MPO (29Olsson I. Olofsson T. Odeberg H. Scand. J. Haematol. 1972; 9: 483-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) and subjected to electrophoretic analysis followed by fluorography as described previously (26Gullberg U. Lindmark A. Nilsson E. Persson A.-M. Olsson I. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25219-25225Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 30Lindmark A. Persson A.-M. Olsson I. Blood. 1990; 76: 2374-2380Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The susceptibility of MPO and MPOΔpro to digestion with Endo-H and N-glycanase was determined as described (26Gullberg U. Lindmark A. Nilsson E. Persson A.-M. Olsson I. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25219-25225Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 30Lindmark A. Persson A.-M. Olsson I. Blood. 1990; 76: 2374-2380Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To determine whether the propeptide of pro-MPO carries a targeting signal for granules, a mutant form of MPO lacking the propeptide (MPOΔpro) was constructed by polymerase chain reactions as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The sequence encoding 122 amino acids from Pro43 to Gly164 (numbered from the methionine constituting the translation initiation site) was deleted from MPO cDNA leaving the first three residues of the propeptide and the entire signal peptide intact (Fig. 2). If the propeptide plays a role for sorting, MPOΔpro-protein would, unlike intact pro-MPO, not be targeted to granules. Likewise, if the propeptide plays a role for folding of nascent protein, the mutant protein might be misfolded and retained in the ER. Wild type MPO and MPOΔpro were transfected to 32D cells, and stable cell clones were established. Clones with synthesis of protein from transfected cDNA were chosen for further experiments in which the consequences of the MPO mutation were investigated. The murine origin of the cell line facilitates the detection of expression of transfected human proteins by biosynthetic radiolabeling followed by immunoprecipitation. No endogenous synthesis of MPO in 32D cells is detected with the antiserum used (data not shown). 32D cells have cytoplasmic granule-like vacuoles that have been shown to be able to accumulate human neutrophil granule constituents such as defensins expressed from DNA transfected into these cells (3Liu L. Ganz T. Blood. 1995; 85: 1095-1103Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, the human hematopoietic serine proteases cathepsin G and proteinase 3 have been successfully transfected to 32D cells and targeted to the granule-like vacuoles (5Garwicz D. Lindmark A. Gullberg U. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28413-28418Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 32Garwicz D. Lindmark A. Hellmark T. Gladh M. Jögi J. Gullberg U. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1997; 61: 113-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). These cells were also found to have the machinery for processing of MPO (see below). Stable 32D cells transfected with wild type cDNA of human MPO show a biosynthesis and processing pattern of MPO similar to that of human myeloid cells expressing MPO. The initially detectable protein is a proform of molecular mass 89 kDa (pro-MPO) (Fig. 3). As observed earlier in promyelocytic HL-60 (9Zeng J. Fenna R.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 226: 185-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar, 22Akin D.T. Kinkade J.M. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1987; 255: 428-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 33Nauseef W.M. Blood. 1986; 67: 865-872Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and in PLB 985 cells (11Nauseef W.M. McCormick S. Yi H. Blood. 1992; 80: 2622-2633Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), processing of pro-MPO into the mature form is slow. A slow processing of pro-MPO is also observed in transfected 32D cells. Thus, a 64-kDa heavy chain and a 15-kDa light chain, representing mature MPO, begin to occur between 6 and 24 h of chase of the radiolabel (Fig. 3). Additional MPO species with molecular masses of approximately 45 kDa, precipitated with anti-MPO, increase with chase of the radiolabel. These peptides are known to be the result of autolytic cleavage of the heavy subunit (34Taylor K.L. Pohl J. Kinkade Jr., J.M. J. Biol.

Similar to the behavior of endogenous MPO in myeloid cells, constitutive secretion of pro-MPO to medium proceeds continually from 32D cells during chase of the radiolabel (Fig. 3). MPO is normally targeted to azurophil granules of the neutrophil series for storage. To investigate targeting in MPO-transfected 32D cells, pulse-chase radiolabeling experiments followed by subcellular fractionation were performed (Fig. 4). Radiolabeled MPO was found to be slowly translocated to dense fractions containing the granule-like vacuoles, where it is clearly visible after 22 h of chase. Translocated (granule-associated) MPO is present almost exclusively in fully mature form consisting of a 64-kDa heavy and 15-kDa light chain. These results are consistent with earlier data from investigations on the processing of endogenous MPO in myeloid cells (10Olsson I. Persson A.-M. Strömberg K. Biochem.

Blood. 1987; 70: 1143-1150Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and demonstrate that 32D cells can process human pro-MPO into mature MPO that is at least partially targeted to a dense subcellular fraction containing granules. Proteolytic processing of endogenous wild type MPO precursor to the mature storage form in granules requires incorporation of heme into pro-MPO (11Nauseef W.M. McCormick S. Yi H. Blood. 1992; 80: 2622-2633Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12Castaneda V.L. Parmley R.T. Pinnix I.B. Raju S.G. Guzman G.S. Kinkade J.M. Exp.

Thus, heme incorporation occurs prior to removal of the propeptide, and it is therefore of interest to determine whether the propeptide is necessary for incorporation of heme. Wild type MPO and propeptide-deleted MPO (MPOΔpro) in transfected 32D cells were therefore compared in this respect. Cells were radiolabeled with [4-14C]ALA, a precursor of heme synthesis, followed by immunoprecipitation with an anti-MPO antibody. As expected, the proform of wild type MPO incorporates heme, indicated by labeling of the protein with [4-14C]ALA (Fig. 5), confirming earlier results (9Zeng J. Fenna R.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 226: 185-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). Incorporation of heme into the propeptide-deleted MPO (MPOΔpro) is also seen (Fig. 5), and this form has a molecular mass of 76 kDa. Thus, the presence of the propeptide is not necessary for incorporation of heme into the proform of MPO. On the other hand, the relative efficiency of insertion of heme seemed to be lower for MPOΔpro compared with the normal proform. This comparison was possible to make as control radiolabeling with [35S]methionine/[35S]cysteine showed immunoprecipitates with similar density for both MPO and MPOΔpro also when visualized through shorter exposure time of the fluorogram than in Fig. 5 (not shown). 32D cells expressing MPOΔpro show an abnormal biosynthesis and processing pattern of MPO (Fig. 6). As expected, a 76-kDa polypeptide is synthesized that may correspond to the size of a pro-MPO that lacks propeptide. However, deletion of the propeptide results in synthesis of a protein that lacks processing into mature two-chain forms and is secreted upon prolonged chase of the radiolabeled product or degraded intracellularly (Fig. 6). Unlike secreted full-length pro-MPO (Fig. 3), secreted MPOΔpro disappears with time (Fig. 6), suggesting extracellular degradation. To investigate if MPOΔpro could be transferred to granules, pulse-chase radiolabeling experiments were carried out followed by subcellular fractionation. Only trace amounts of radiolabeled MPOΔpro and degradation products are visible in dense fractions containing the granule-like vacuoles (Fig. 7).Figure 7Lack of targeting of propeptide-deleted MPO (MPOΔpro) in 32D cells. Cells transfected with cDNA for human MPOΔpro were incubated with [35S]methionine/[35S]cysteine for 1 h followed by chase of the label for 3 and 12 h. At these time points, 100 × 106 cells were homogenized after which subcellular fractionation of the postnuclear supernatant was performed by centrifugation in Percoll followed by collection of nine subcellular fractions, fraction 9 containing all the cytosol. The fractions were lysed and subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-MPO. Immunoprecipitates were analyzed as described in the legend to Fig. 3. The position of MPOΔpro (Δpro) is indicated with anarrow. The fluorogram was exposed for 5 days. Peak activities of β-hexosaminidase, fraction 2, and galactosyltransferase, fraction 6, indicate the position of lysosomes and Golgi elements, respectively.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Since only trace amounts of partially degraded MPOΔpro are detected in dense fractions, the results suggest that degradation of non-secreted MPOΔpro preferentially takes place in a pre-granule compartment. However, it is possible that substantial degradation of MPOΔpro would still take place in granule-like vacuoles but too rapidly to be detectable. Therefore, to rule out considerable transfer to granules with degradation, experiments were performed with chloroquine and NH4Cl, agents that block lysosomal proteolysis. In particular, chloroquine blocks late proteolytic processing of MPO (16Strömberg K. Persson A.-M. Olsson I. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1985; 39: 424-431Google Scholar). Biosynthetic radiolabeling of MPOΔpro in transfected 32D cells and chase of the radiolabel in the presence of NH4Cl or chloroquine does not diminish the degradation rate of MPOΔpro, indicating that lysosomes are not involved to any great extent in the degradation observed (Fig. 8). The secretion of MPOΔpro also occurs during incubation with NH4Cl and chloroquine, although it is reduced by NH4Cl. Secreted MPOΔpro is of slightly higher molecular weight than the protein retained intracellularly both in the control and in the presence of NH4Cl or chloroquine, indicating additional glycosylation during the secretory process. To characterize the localization of the degradation further, cell radiolabeling experiments were performed in the presence of brefeldin A (BFA), w"
https://openalex.org/W1970895193,"Type II collagen mutations have been identified in a phenotypic continuum of chondrodysplasias that range widely in clinical severity. They include achondrogenesis type II, hypochondrogenesis, spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia congenita, spondyloepimetaphyseal dysplasia, Kniest dysplasia, and Stickler syndrome. We report here results that define the underlying genetic defect and consequent altered structure of assembled type II collagen in a neonatal lethal form of Kniest dysplasia. Electrophoresis of a cyanogen bromide (CNBr) (CB) digest of sternal cartilage revealed an α1(II)CB11 peptide doublet and a slightly retarded mobility for all major CB peptides, which implied post-translational overmodification. Further peptide mapping and sequence analysis of CB11 revealed equal amounts of a normal α1(II) sequence and a chain lacking the 18 residues (361–378 of the triple helical domain) corresponding to exon 24. Sequence analysis of an amplified genomic DNA fragment identified a G to A transition in the +5 position of the splice donor consensus sequence of intron 24 in one allele. Cartilage matrix analysis showed that the short α1(II) chain was present in collagen molecules that had become cross-linked into fibrils. Trypsin digestion of the pepsin-extracted native type II collagen selectively cleaved the normal length α1(II) chains within the exon 24 domain. These findings support a hypothesis that normal and short α-chains had combined to form heterotrimeric molecules in which the chains were in register in both directions from the deletion site, accommodated effectively by a loop out of the normal chain exon 24 domain. Such an accommodation, with potential overall shortening of the helical domain and hence misalignment of intermolecular relationships within fibrils, offers a common molecular mechanism by which a group of different mutations might act to produce the Kniest phenotype.

The chondrodysplasias are a clinically and genetically heterogeneous group of skeletal disorders characterized by abnormal endochondral ossification (1Rimoin D.L. Lachman R.S. Emery A.E.H.

Connective Tissue and Its Heritable Disorders. Wiley-Liss, Inc., New York1993: 641-675Google Scholar). Phenotypes within the group of chondrodysplasias caused by mutations in the gene for type II collagen, COL2A1, range in severity from the neonatal lethal dwarfing conditions achondrogenesis type II and hypochondrogenesis to mild phenotypes, such as Stickler syndrome, in which there is little observed skeletal growth abnormality (3Spranger J. Winterpacht A. Zabel B. Eur. J. Pediatr. 1994; 153: 56-65PubMed Google Scholar). Together with the spondyloepiphyseal dysplasias and spondyloepimetaphyseal dysplasias, Kniest dysplasia is a moderately severe disorder within the clinical spectrum of type II collagenopathies (1Rimoin D.L. Lachman R.S. Emery A.E.H. Rimoin D.L. Principles and Practice of Medical Genetics. 3rd Ed. Churchill Livingstone, Edinburgh, UK1996: 2779-2815Google Scholar, 2Horton W.A. Hecht J.T. Royce P.M.

The phenotype is characterized by disproportionate dwarfism, a short trunk and small pelvis, kyphoscoliosis, and short limbs with prominent joints that can have restricted mobility. Craniofacial anomalies may include a flat face, myopia and retinal detachment, cleft palate, and hearing loss. Radiographic features include narrowed joint spaces, platyspondyly, vertical clefts of the vertebral bodies, short tubular bones, large epiphyses, and flared metaphyses. Cartilage from Kniest dysplasia patients displays a distinct morphology, termed “Swiss cheese” cartilage (5Rimoin D.L. Adv. Hum. Genet. 1975; 5: 1-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), which is diagnostic for the phenotype. The matrix has a foamy appearance with sparse, thin collagen fibrils surrounding the chondrocytes and thickened fibrils in the periphery. Abnormal type II collagen can be isolated in high yield from Kniest dysplasia cartilage (6Bogaert R. Wilkin D. Wilcox W.R. Lachman R. Rimoin D. Cohn D.H. Eyre D.R. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1994; 55: 1128-1136PubMed Google Scholar, 7Wilkin D.J. Bogaert R. Lachman R.S. Rimoin D.L. Eyre D.R. Cohn D.H. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1994; 3: 1999-2003Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), suggesting that the incorporation of mutant type II collagen into the matrix produces the characteristic histologic appearance. Of about 10 distinct mutations known to cause Kniest dysplasia, most result in whole or partial exon deletions that cluster in the amino-terminal half of the triple-helical domain of the type II collagen molecule (8Spranger J. Winterpacht A. Zabel B. Am. J. Med. Genet. 1997; 69: 79-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Previously we suggested two models for the assembly of type II collagen trimers composed of normal chains and chains with a deletion: 1) maintenance of the triple-helix along the length of the molecule from the carboxyl terminus, resulting in a misregister of short chains relative to normal chains from the deletion site to the amino terminus and 2) “loop out” of the normal chain(s) with maintenance of chain registration and a normal amino-terminal structure (6Bogaert R. Wilkin D. Wilcox W.R. Lachman R. Rimoin D. Cohn D.H. Eyre D.R. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1994; 55: 1128-1136PubMed Google Scholar). Here, we describe a new dominant mutation that results in the skipping of exon 24 and produces a severe form of Kniest dysplasia. Analysis of the abnormal type II collagen from the tissue provides evidence for the second model, that the normal chain sequences in effect loop out at the site of the deletion. The proband, the female product of a 37-week gestation, died of respiratory distress at 10 days of age. The infant had short limbs, club feet, cleft palate, midface hypoplasia, and a narrow chest. X-rays revealed flattened vertebral bodies with coronal clefts, slight shortening of the ribs, and dumbbell-shaped femurs. These findings were compatible with a diagnosis of Kniest dysplasia (9Lachman R.S. Rimoin D.L. Hollister D.W. Dorst J.P. Siggers D.C. McAlister W. Kaufman R.L. Langer L.O. Am. J. Roentgenol. Radium Ther. Nucl. Med. 1975; 123: 805-814Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Cartilage and other tissues were obtained for analysis. Sternal cartilage was extracted in 4 m guanidine HCl, 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.0, at 4 °C for 48 h. The washed residue was digested with pepsin (10Miller E.J. Biochemistry. 1972; 11: 4903-4909Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar). Cartilage from a 4-day-old infant was similarly treated as a control. Sternal cartilage was digested with CNBr in 70% (w/v) formic acid for 24 h at room temperature (11Eyre D.R. Muir H. Biochem. J. 1975; 151: 595-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar), and the resulting peptides were fractionated by sequential cation-exchange and reverse-phase HPLC 1The abbreviations used are: HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; bp, base pair(s); RT, reverse transcription; CB, cyanogen bromide.

Methods Enzymol. 1987; 144: 115-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). Fractions containing α1(II)CB11 (identified by SDS-PAGE) were pooled, dried, and digested further with either trypsin or endoproteinase Asp-N. Resulting peptides were fractionated by reverse-phase HPLC (13Eyre D.R. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 144: 115-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). Peptide yields were estimated by integration of peak areas of 220-nm absorbance and by the recoveries of phenylthiohydantoin-derivatives on subsequent sequence analysis. Pepsin-solubilized native collagens from patient and control tissues were dissolved in 0.1m NH4HCO3, 0.01% (w/v) SDS, pH 7.8, at 24 °C. Trypsin was added at a 1:100 (w/w) enzyme:substrate ratio, and aliquots were incubated at various temperatures ranging from 24 to 37 °C for 18 h. The digests were then run on 6% gels (SDS-PAGE) and electroblotted to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane for sequence analysis. The method of Laemmli (14Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207856) Google Scholar) was used with 6% and 12.5% gels, respectively, for whole α-chains and CNBr peptides. Amino-terminal sequence analysis of individual peptides was carried out by Edman chemistry on a Porton 2090E machine equipped with on-line HPLC analysis of the phenylthiohydantoin-derivatives. The standard program was modified to resolve 4-hydroxyproline, hydroxylysine, and the two hydroxylysine glycosides. Cartilage was acid-hydrolyzed (6n HCl, 110 °C, 24 h) for analysis by reverse-phase HPLC (15Eyre D.R. Koob T.J. Van Ness K.P. Anal. Biochem. 1984; 137: 380-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (642) Google Scholar) of the pyridinoline cross-links of collagen. Hydroxyproline was quantified in the same hydrolysate by colorimetric assay (16Stegemann H. Z. Phys. Chem. 1958; 311: 41-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar). Pyridinoline concentration was expressed in mol/mol of collagen for comparison of tissues. The CNBr digests of pepsin-extracted type II collagen were also analyzed by molecular sieve HPLC (Toso-Haas G3000SW, 7.5 mm x 60 cm, two columns in series (6Bogaert R. Wilkin D. Wilcox W.R.

Cartilage from the proband was prepared for light and electron microscopy as described previously (17Bogaert R. Tiller G.E. Weis M.A. Gruber H.E. Rimoin D.L. Cohn D.H. Eyre D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 22522-22526Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Total RNA was isolated from cartilage by the method of Chomczynski and Sacchi (18Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Chem. 1987; 162: 156-159Google Scholar). RT-PCR was carried out essentially as described previously (19Edwards A. Hammond H.A. Jin L. Caskey C.T. Chakraborty R. Genomics. 1992; 12: 241-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (1208) Google Scholar). Briefly, COL2A1 cDNA was synthesized by reverse transcription using 1 μg of total RNA and a gene-specific primer complementary to sequences in exon 25 (5′-CCAGGACGACCATCTTCACCA-3′). Amplification by PCR used the reverse transcription primer and a second gene-specific primer that annealed within exon 23 (5′-CAAGGGAGCCAACGGTGACC-3′). DNA was denatured at 94 °C for 2 min followed by 35 cycles of 1 min at 94 °C, 1 min at 60 °C, and 1 min at 72 °C in a DNA Thermal Cycler (Perkin-Elmer). The final 72 °C step was extended to 10 min. PCR products were analyzed by electrophoresis through 6% polyacrylamide gels. Genomic DNA was isolated from fibroblasts or lymphoblastoid cell lines by standard methods. A genomic DNA fragment was amplified by PCR using a COL2A1 intron 23 forward primer (5′-CAGCCCTGCACTGCCAGGAT-3′) and the exon 25 reverse primer described above. Cycling conditions were as described above. PCR products were purified using the QIAquick PCR purification kit (Qiagen, Inc.) and cloned using the TA cloning kit (Invitrogen Corp.). Colonies were grown and plasmid DNA was isolated by standard methods. Sequencing was with the fluorescent dideoxy terminator method of cycle sequencing on a Perkin-Elmer/ABI 373a automated DNA sequencer following ABI protocols. The collagen peptides from CNBr-digested Kniest cartilage migrated more slowly than their control counterparts on SDS-PAGE (Fig. 1). Peptide CB11 appeared to run as a doublet of bands, one migrating more slowly and the other faster than the control CB11 (Fig. 1, left lane). The pepsin-solubilized α1(II) chains from Kniest cartilage migrated as a broad band, slightly slower than control α1(II). These observations suggested a deletion in peptide CB11 in about half the α1(II) chains of the tissue. The faster CB11 band was the deletion candidate, and the slower CB11 band behaved as a post-translationally overmodified normal peptide. There was no obvious enrichment or abnormality of collagen α1(II) chains in the guanidine HCl extract of Kniest cartilage compared with control cartilage (not shown). Enrichment from the cartilage CNBr digest by cation-exchange HPLC and analysis by SDS-PAGE confirmed that CB11 was the source of the doublet (Fig. 2). Pooled fractions of CB11 were purified by reverse-phase HPLC (not shown), and aliquots were digested with trypsin or endoproteinase Asp-N for peptide mapping in comparison with control CB11. Fig. 3 shows the resulting tryptic peptide profiles. (The endoproteinase Asp-N results are not shown.) Peptides that appeared to be unique to the patient were selected for amino-terminal sequence analysis. The observed peptide sequence shown underlined in Fig. 3 a would result from trypsin cleavage if the exon 24 domain (residues 361–378 of the triple helix; Ref. 20Baldwin C.T. Reginato A.M. Smith C. Jiminez S.A. Prockop D.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1989; 81: 521-528Google Scholar) were deleted to create a new tryptic cleavage site between the terminal Arg-360 of exon 23 and the initial Gly-379 of exon 25. Deletion of the exon 24 sequence was confirmed by sequence analysis of an endoproteinase Asp-N peptide, which spanned the deletion site. It was estimated from densitometry of the two CB11 bands on SDS-PAGE and the yields of the various peptides on sequence analysis that the proportion of deletion-bearing α-chains in the Kniest tissue was 40–50% that of total α1(II).Figure 3Reverse-phase HPLC of tryptic peptides from α1(II)CB11. The column (C8, 25 cm x 4.6 mm, RP-300 Brownlee Laboratories) was eluted with a linear gradient (0–30% in 60 min) of acetonitrile:n-propanol (3:1, v/v) in 0.1% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid at 1 ml/min.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The pepsin-solubilized molecule was probed with trypsin in an attempt to distinguish between two hypotheses concerning the structural consequences of forming trimers from a mixture of normal and deleted chains (6Bogaert R. Wilkin D. Wilcox W.R. Lachman R. Rimoin D. Cohn D.H. Eyre D.R. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1994; 55: 1128-1136PubMed Google Scholar). The first possibility was that the α-chains were in correct register with respect to their X- and Y-position amino acids, both amino-terminal and carboxyl-terminal to the disrupted region at the deletion site. This hypothesis requires that the normal chains in effect loop out to preserve the chain registration. The second possibility is that the molecules fold into a continuous triple helix without regard to chain registration. This means that the X- and Y-position residues would be out of register amino-terminal to the deletion and that the chain(s) with the deletion would stop short of the amino terminus of the molecule. The pepsin-solubilized collagen used as the substrate contained a ratio of short to normal chains of about 2:3 based on the CB11 doublet on SDS-PAGE of a cyanogen bromide digest. On digestion with trypsin at 24 °C, this collagen yielded two cleavage products when analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Microsequence analysis of the larger product (2/3 fragment, Fig. 4 A) gave two sequences; one beginning at residue 361 of the triple helical domain (GLTGRPG … ) and the other at residue 375 (VGPSGAP … ). Both originate in the exon 24-coded sequence (Fig. 4 B) and so must have derived from normal α1(II) chains that presumably had been incorporated into heterotrimers that also included one or two deletion-bearing chains. Amino-terminal sequence analysis of the smaller product (1/3 fragment, Fig. 4 A) revealed the NH2 terminus of the α1(II) chain beginning in the NH2-telopeptide and running into the triple-helical domain (GVMQGPM … ). Trypsin digestion of the collagen at 34 °C also yielded two cleavage products when analyzed by SDS-PAGE. The larger product (2/3 fragment, Fig. 4 A) yielded the same two amino-terminal sequences found at 24 °C plus a third sequence starting at residue 379 (GAPGEDG … ) in the domain encoded by exon 25. This trypsin cleavage product can only arise from the exon 24-deleted product of the mutant allele. At 37 °C, trypsin digestion produced little or no observable 2/3 and 1/3 fragments, although at least half of the starting collagen had been degraded, as seen by the decrease in α1(II). Presumably, this reflects rapid melting of the two triple helical fragments and further proteolysis of their denatured chains at the higher temperature. The faint band in the 37 °C Kniest lane (Fig. 4 A) that appears to be the 1/3 fragment may in fact be a degradation product of the 2/3 fragment. (The minor band seen running midway between the 2/3 and 1/3 fragments in the 34 °C Kniest lane proved by sequence analysis to be a COOH-terminal piece of the 2/3 fragment.) To explore the apparent melting properties of the collagen in more detail, the trypsin digestion experiment was repeated with brief digestion (2 min) and a higher enzyme:substrate ratio (1:4). Electrophoresis of the products formed at 31–43 °C in 2 °C increments revealed the same 2/3 and 1/3 fragments at 31–35 °C (results not shown). No other discrete cleavage products were seen, and the remaining full-length molecules melted and were degraded to small fragments with an apparent Tm above 39 °C for both Kniest and control collagens. Analysis of the CNBr digest of type II collagen from the Kniest cartilage by molecular sieve HPLC gave a similar peptide profile to that of control cartilage (Fig. 5). The fluorescence profiles each had two peaks that contain the cross-linked peptides from the two sites of pyridinoline cross-linking, two NH2-telopeptides linked to α1(II)CB9,7 and two COOH-telopeptides linked to α1(II)CB12. For both control and Kniest tissue, the ratio of fluorescence between these two peptide pools was similar. This indicates that for the total pool of collagen in the Kniest tissue there is no obvious imbalance in relative occupancy of the two cross-linking sites, which lie at opposite ends of the triple-helix (13Eyre D.R. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 144: 115-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). The concentration of hydroxylysyl pyridinoline cross-links in the Kniest cartilage collagen was 0.87 residues/collagen molecule, compared with a range of 0.5–1.5 residues/collagen molecule for control infant cartilage. The collagen content of the Kniest tissue, however, was 19% that of the dry weight, compared with 50–60% for neonatal control cartilage. Light microscopy of the Kniest cartilage showed the typical Swiss cheese and a perilacunar foamy appearance characteristic of the phenotype (Fig. 6 A; Refs. 1Rimoin D.L. Lachman R.S. Emery A.E.H. Rimoin D.L. Principles and Practice of Medical Genetics. 3rd Ed. Churchill Livingstone, Edinburgh, UK1996: 2779-2815Google Scholarand 5Rimoin D.L. Adv. Hum. Genet. 1975; 5: 1-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Transmission electron microscopy showed sparse, thin collagen fibrils immediately surrounding the chondrocytes and thickened fibrils in the periphery (not shown). The chondrocytes contained large inclusion bodies of rough endoplasmic reticulum swollen with a granular material that is presumably abnormal type II collagen (Fig. 6 B; Ref. 21Poole A.R. Pidoux I. Rosenberg L. Hollister D. Murray L. Rimoin D. J. Clin. Invest. 1988; 81: 579-589Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). To identify the underlying mutation, a cDNA fragment designed to contain the exon 24 coding domain was amplified from total RNA prepared from the Kniest cartilage. This analysis revealed the expected 189-bp fragment, also amplified from control cartilage RNA, plus a shorter fragment of approximately 135 bp (Fig. 7). This smaller fragment would result from mRNA in which exon 24 was deleted, compatible with an exon skipping mutation and consistent with the protein data. Direct sequence analysis of an amplified genomic DNA fragment containing the consensus splice sequences flanking exon 24 demonstrated that the patient was heterozygous for a G to A transition at position +5 of the intron 24 splice donor (Fig. 8).Figure 8RT-PCR. A, cartilage mRNA from the proband (lane 1) and two control individuals (lanes 2 and 3) were reverse-transcribed, and sequences surrounding COL2A1 exon 24 were amplified by PCR. RT-PCR from the proband revealed two bands of 189 and 135 bp, whereas RT-PCR from the control individuals only resulted in a 189-bp fragment. B, as depicted here, RT-PCR using mRNA that lacked sequences corresponding to COL2A1 exon 24, resulted in a 135-bp fragment (Kniest), whereas RT-PCR from normal alleles resulted in an 189-bp fragment.

This extends the number of distinct COL2A1 mutations known to cause this phenotype to 10. They include splice-site mutations that cause or predict skipping of exons 12 (22Winterpacht A. Hilbert M.

Rimoin, unpublished results. have also been found in Kniest-like cases. It is notable that the exon 20 skipping mutation manifested as a spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia phenotype in the father and a Kniest-like radiographic phenotype in an affected fetus (24Tiller G.E. Weis M.A. Polumbo P.A. Gruber H.E. Rimoin D.L. Cohn D.H. Eyre D.R. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1995; 56: 388-395PubMed Google Scholar). Similarly, the G103D substitution resulted in a Kniest diagnosis from birth to 2 years (7Wilkin D.J. Bogaert R. Lachman R.S. Rimoin D.L. Eyre D.R. Cohn D.H. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1994; 3: 1999-2003Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), but the child went on to develop features of an spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia phenotype. 3D. L. Rimoin, unpublished observations. The present molecular defect, a G to A transition at the +5 position of the donor splice site of intron 24, results in skipping of exon 24 in the spliced product of the mutant allele. The other allele and its spliced transcript are normal. This gene defect explains the recovery of both normal α1(II) protein sequences and exon 24-deleted α1(II) sequences from the structural collagen of the Kniest cartilage. Our detection of mRNA lacking exon 24 was nonquantitative and based on RT-PCR using primers for exons 23 and 25. It is possible that other mRNA splice forms had resulted from the mutation that were not detected by this strategy and also that some of the abnormal transcripts were degraded in the nucleus. Yields of cyanogen bromide peptides on SDS-PAGE and of sequenced peptides indicate a ratio of short α1(II)/normal α1(II) of about two-thirds in the tissue. The inextractability of the short α1(II) chains in 4 m guanidine HCl and their recovery in triple-helical collagen molecules after pepsin digestion of the tissue indicate that they had become incorporated into the structural fabric of the extracellular matrix as components of cross-linked fibrils. The pyridinoline content/mol of tissue collagen and the distribution of these cross-links between the two intermolecular cross-linking sites in type II collagen (27Wu J.J. Eyre D.R. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 1850-1857Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) were in the normal range for neonatal cartilage. The content of collagen/tissue dry weight (19%) was low, however, consistent with the sparse distribution of collagen fibrils in Kniest cartilage seen by electron microscopy (28Horton W.A. Rimoin D.L. Pediatr. Res. 1979; 13: 1266-1270Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Matrix deposition of collagen-containing mutant α1(II) chains appears to be a common feature in Kniest dysplasia. Including the present results, we and others have observed this for at least five different COL2A1 mutations that showed a Kniest-like phenotype and from which cartilage was available for analysis (6Bogaert R. Wilkin D. Wilcox W.R. Lachman R. Rimoin D. Cohn D.H. Eyre D.R. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1994; 55: 1128-1136PubMed Google Scholar, 7Wilkin D.J. Bogaert R. Lachman R.S. Rimoin D.L. Eyre D.R. Cohn D.H. Hum.

Res. 1996; 14: 712-721Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar).2 The phenotype may be owing, therefore, to the dominant negative effect of a particular form of mutant α1(II) chain being incorporated into molecules and fibrils of the extracellular matrix of cartilage. The deficiency of extracellular collagen and effects on chondrocytes of retaining abnormal protein presumably also must contribute greatly to the pathology. However, deficiency alone is unlikely to explain the unique phenotype since a matrix deficiency of type II collagen and chondrocyte accumulation of inclusion bodies is seen in the other type II collagenopathies (achondrogenesis II, hypochondrogenesis, spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia congenita, spondyloepimetaphyseal dysplasia), but their clinical presentation and cartilage histopathology are different from Kniest dysplasia. An extensive body of published data on similar but not identical mutations that affect type I procollagen genes and cause osteogenesis imperfecta provides the basis for interpreting the results (30Byers P.H. Royce P.M. Steinmann B. Connective Tissue and Its Heritable Disorders. Wiley-Liss, Inc., New York1993: 317-350Google Scholar, 31Kuivaniemi H. Tromp G. Prockop D.J. FASEB J. 1991; 5: 2052-2060Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar). These include glycine substitutions and several multi-exon (32Mundlos S. Chan D. Weng Y.M. Sillence D.O. Cole W.G. Bateman J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21068-21074Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) and single exon (33Chipman S.D. Shapiro J.R. McKinstry M.B. Stover M.L. Branson P. Rowe D.W. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1992; 7: 793-805Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar) deletions in COL1A1 and COL1A2 that cause in-frame shortening of the triple-helical domain of the expressed collagen chains. Cultured skin fibroblasts were routinely studied to define the consequences of such mutations on the molecular assembly of procollagen type I. There are relatively few data, however, on the structural collagen of osteogenesis imperfecta patient tissues, particularly from cases of single exon deletion. There is one report on a patient with osteogenesis imperfecta type IV caused by a mutation in COL1A2 that resulted in skipping of exon 12 (33Chipman S.D. Shapiro J.R. McKinstry M.B. Stover M.L. Branson P. Rowe D.W. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1992; 7: 793-805Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Both skin fibroblasts and osteoblasts in culture incorporated the product of the mutant allele into secreted procollagen (33Chipman S.D. Shapiro J.R. McKinstry M.B. Stover M.L. Branson P. Rowe D.W. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1992; 7: 793-805Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). On pepsin treatment, some of the molecules were shortened at the amino terminus of the helix in both α1(I) and α2(I) chains, consistent with a helix disruption at the deletion site. The present study, therefore, is novel in providing data on structural collagen, in this case type II collagen, extracted from the extracellular matrix of a tissue assembled in vivo. The trypsin digestion results reveal how exon 24-deleted α1(II) chains affect the structure of molecules into which they become incorporated. In theory, from equal pools of normal and exon 24-deleted chains, three kinds of molecule could assemble. One-eighth would be normal homotrimers, 18 would be short-chain homotrimers and68 would be heterotrimers of normal and short chains (34Lee B. Vissing H. Ramirez F. Rogers D. Rimoin D. Science. 1989; 244: 978-980Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Whether all these forms assemble into stable molecules and get secreted from the chondrocytes is unknown. What is clear is that a significant fraction of molecules containing short chains do get out of the cell and become cross-linked into extracellular fibrils. The best explanation for the trypsin cleavage results is that heterotrimers present a locally disrupted domain at the deletion site (35Bächinger H.P. Morris N.P. Davis J.M. Am. J. Med. Genet. 1993; 45: 152-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar) in which the normal chain exon 24 domains lack a triple-helical conformation and so can be cleaved after arginine and lysine (Fig. 4 B). At 24–31 °C, the normal α1(II) chains were clipped but only in their exon 24 domain, indicating a local disruption within the triple helix. At 34 °C, the local structure further unfolded to allow cleavage after the arginine residue in the exon 24-deleted chain(s). The resulting 13 and 23 segments retained a native triple helix, so explaining the products of trypsin digestion identified on SDS-PAGE (Fig. 4 A). Molecules assembled from three normal α1(II) chains are not cleaved at 24 or 34 °C, as seen for the control type II collagen. If heterotrimers of short and normal chains had folded as an uninterrupted zipper into a continuous triple helix from the COOH to the NH2 terminus through the deletion site (36Wallis G.A. Kadler K.E. Starman B.J. Byers P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25529-25534Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 37Willing M.C. Cohn D.H. Starman B. Holbrook K.A. Greenberg C.R. Byers P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 8398-8404Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 38Chessler S.D. Byers P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 7751-7757Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), then trypsin would not be expected to have cleaved at the bonds observed. The data, therefore, strongly support the loop-out explanation and a mechanism of triple-helix folding that can accommodate a relatively large deletion of 18 residues. This is consistent with the concept that rather than being a uniform rod, the triple helix consists of a series of alternating domains of high and low stability that can fold cooperatively but somewhat independently as helix formation proceeds from initial registration and nucleation at the COOH terminus (39Prockop D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 15349-15352Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Indeed, regions of micro-unfolding can be observed in preparations of normal types I and II collagens as cleavage products when pepsin is used at acid pH above 4 °C (40Sokolov B.P. Sher B.M. Kozlov E.A. Tsvetkova T.A. Del'vig A.A. Biokhimiya. 1988; 53: 1828-1836PubMed Google Scholar). But such products were not a relevant feature of our starting collagen preparation made at 4 °C. The fibrillar matrix of hyaline cartilage is a cross-linked copolymer of collagen types II, IX, and XI (41Wu J.J. Eyre D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18865-18870Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 42Diab M. Wu J.J. Eyre D.R. Biochem. J. 1996; 314: 327-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Type II collagen is the main component. Types IX and XI together represent about 20% of the total collagen in fetal cartilage and decrease to <5% in mature articular cartilage (43Eyre D.R. Wu J.J. Niyibizi C. Cohn D. Glorieaux F.H. Martin T.J. Calcium Regulation and Bone Metabolism. Elsevier Science Publishers B.V., Amsterdam1990: 188-194Google Scholar). In mature cartilage collagen, the main intermolecular cross-links are trivalent pyridinoline residues, which link type II collagen molecules in fibrils at two head-to-tail sites (27Wu J.J. Eyre D.R. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 1850-1857Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Two COOH-telopeptides link to helix Lys-87, and two NH2-telopeptides link to helix Lys-930. The present analyses for cross-links in Kniest cartilage and the occupancy of cross-linking sites in the isolated type II collagen show no gross effect on intermolecular cross-linking of the short α1(II) chains. There may be subtle effects, for example in restricting the potential number of cross-linking interactions between nearest neighbor molecules packed in the polymer. Thus, if molecules containing short α1(II) chains are shorter than normal molecules and become part of the fibril polymer, then not all telopeptide-to-helix interaction sites may be aligned correctly, so that the normal spatial pattern of intermolecular cross-linking may be disturbed. It may be relevant in this respect that the known mutations causing Kniest dysplasia appear to be mostly clustered about one region of the NH2-terminal half of the molecule. One exception is a deletion of the COOH-terminal six residues of the triple-helix (26Winterpacht A. Superti-Furga A. Schwarze U. Stoss H. Steinmann B. Spranger J. Zabel B. J. Med. Genet. 1996; 33: 649-654Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Conceivably, shortening here could affect the positioning of the nearby COOH-telopeptides relative to their normal interaction sites in the helical domains of adjacent molecules in a fibril. The initial physical interactions responsible for the assembly of monomers into a type II collagen fibril, which may require specific binding domains along the triple helix (44Fertala A. Holmes D.F. Kadler K.E. Sieron A.L. Prockop D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14864-14869Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), could also be affected. The susceptibility of collagen molecules from Kniest tissue to helical domain cleavage by trypsin raises another potential source of cartilage morbidity. Matrix proteases that are involved in extracellular remodeling that do not normally attack collagen might damage Kniest fibrils. Thus, the collagen network might be prone to progressive proteolytic damage at the sites of the helical domain imperfections. This could explain the degenerate, vacular appearance of the matrix. The presence of abnormal type II collagen molecules might also disturb the copolymeric assembly of types IX and XI collagens into the fibril architecture. Finally, since the collagen type XI molecule normally includes one α1(II) chain (34Lee B. Vissing H. Ramirez F. Rogers D. Rimoin D. Science. 1989; 244: 978-980Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar), incorporating a short α1(II) chain could negatively affect collagen type XI function. The exceptions to the emerging pattern of full or partial exon-skipping mutations underlying Kniest dysplasia are two G to D substitutions (Ref. 7Wilkin D.J. Bogaert R. Lachman R.S. Rimoin D.L. Eyre D.R. Cohn D.H. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1994; 3: 1999-2003Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar).2 They are close to each other (G103D, G127D), and one of them (G103D) is within the 7 amino acid sequence at the COOH terminus of exon 12 that is deleted in two other, unrelated Kniest cases (6Bogaert R. Wilkin D. Wilcox W.R. Lachman R. Rimoin D. Cohn D.H. Eyre D.R. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1994; 55: 1128-1136PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, if a G to D substitution is particularly disruptive, as collagen type I mutations in osteogenesis imperfecta suggest (36Wallis G.A. Kadler K.E. Starman B.J. Byers P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25529-25534Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 45Lightfoot S.J. Atkinson M.S. Murphy G. Byers P.H. Kadler K.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30352-30357Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), it might also result in a looping out of normal chains in this domain of the heterotrimer so that the net effect on the molecule and fibril may be the same as a short deletion. We suggest this unifying hypothesis to explain in part how different mutations might act through a common molecular mechanism to produce characteristic features of the Kniest phenotype.

https://openalex.org/W1599896138,"We present a hypothesis on the mechanisms used by cells to transport cargo through the secretory system. We propose that at least three basic processes coordinately participate in membrane traffic: cisternal maturation-progression, controlled cargo diffusion along transient membrane continuities between different compartments, and a mostly retrograde vesicle-mediated transport. A 'synthetic' model based on the combination of these mechanisms can explain both the progression of supramolecular aggregates through the secretory pathway and the fast intra-Golgi transport of conventional cargoes. Analysis of the existing literature shows that the available data are consistent with the proposed model."
https://openalex.org/W2005816439,"Abstract A physiologically relevant response to insulin, stimulation of prolactin promoter activity in GH4 pituitary cells, was used as an assay to study the specificity of protein-tyrosine phosphatase function. Receptor-like protein-tyrosine phosphatase α (RPTPα) blocks the effect of insulin to increase prolactin gene expression but potentiates the effects of epidermal growth factor and cAMP on prolactin promoter activity. RPTPα was the only protein-tyrosine phosphatase tested that did this. Thus, the effect of RPTPα on prolactin-chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) promoter activity is specific by two criteria. A number of potential RPTPα targets were ruled out by finding (a) that they are not affected or (b) that they are not on the pathway to insulin-increased prolactin-CAT activity. The negative effect of RPTPα on insulin activation of the prolactin promoter is not due to reduced phosphorylation or kinase activity of the insulin receptor or to reduced phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate-1 or Shc. Inhibitor studies suggest that insulin-increased prolactin gene expression is mediated by a Ras-like GTPase but is not mitogen-activated protein kinase dependent. Experiments with inhibitors of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase suggest that insulin-increased prolactin-CAT expression is phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-independent. These results suggest that RPTPα may be a physiological regulator of insulin action."
https://openalex.org/W1560895679,"The tumor suppressor proteins IRF-1 and p53 are involved in response pathways after DNA damage. In different cell types, IRF-1 and p53 can cooperate to produce cell cycle arrest (embryo fibroblasts) or can independently trigger apoptosis (lymphoid cells). p53 may also regulate DNA repair, but there is no information on IRF-1 and repair. The cell lineage dependency of these effects precludes extrapolation of findings to other tissues of relevance to human cancer. Here, we report the consequences of IRF-1 deficiency for apoptosis, cell cycle arrest, and DNA repair in primary hepatocytes after DNA damage and extend previous work on the role of p53 in hepatocytes. IRF-1-deficient hepatocytes showed reduced DNA repair activity compared with wild-type, as assessed by unscheduled DNA synthesis after UV irradiation (10J/m2) and by host reactivation of a UV-damaged reporter construct. p53-deficient hepatocytes also showed reduced unscheduled DNA synthesis after UV, but there was no impairment of specific repair in host reactivation assays. IRF-1 deficiency did not affect the p53-dependent G1/S arrest after UV irradiation. Hepatocyte apoptosis after UV treatment, previously reported to be independent of p53, was also independent of IRF-1. However, IRF-1 deficiency produced dysregulation of p53, manifested as increased transactivation of a p53-reporter plasmid in undamaged hepatocytes, and accelerated p53 stabilization after DNA damage. Hence, in hepatocytes, IRF-1 is not required for growth arrest or apoptosis after DNA damage, but the results suggest for the first time a role in DNA repair regulation."

The functional viability of these ARC/PVN cultures was verified by their ability to synthesize and secrete CRH, AVP, and β-END under basal and depolarizing (veratridine) conditions in vitro. Peptide secretion was shown to be Ca2+ and Na+ dependent in that it was blocked in the presence of veraspamil and tetrodotoxin, respectively. Exposure of ARC/PVN cocultures to the glucocorticoid dexamethasone (DEX) resulted in a dose-dependent increase of CRH secretion and an inhibition of AVP and β-END; the CRH responses deviated strikingly from predictions based on in vivo experiments. Steroid withdrawal or treatment with the glucocorticoid receptor antagonist RU38486 reversed these trends. Opposite effects of DEX on CRH secretion were observed in cultures consisting of PVN cells only. Supported by studies using an opioid receptor agonist (morphine) and antagonist (naloxone), these observations demonstrate that ARC-derived (β-END) neurons modulate the responses of PVN neurons to DEX.—Hellbach, S., Gärtner, P., Deicke, J., Fischer, D., Hassan, A.

Thirty mice were inoculated with LP-BM5; 30 received vehicle (DMEM) injections. Fifteen LP-BM5 and 15 DMEM mice were trained in avoidance 7 wk after inoculation; retention of the avoidance response was tested 4 wk later. The remaining mice were trained 11 wk after inoculation. In animals trained 7 wk after inoculation, the groups performed similarly, with a marginally significant tendency for LP-BM5-infected animals to make more avoidance responses. This group difference was significant when animals were retested at 11 wk. However, LP-BM5 animals trained 11 wk after inoculation made significantly fewer avoidance responses than controls trained at the same time. We conclude that in later stages of disease, LP-BM5 impairs response acquisition, but not performance, in the active avoidance procedure.
