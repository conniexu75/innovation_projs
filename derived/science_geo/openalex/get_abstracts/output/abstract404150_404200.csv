https://openalex.org/W1999793922,"Crops engineered to produce insecticidal toxins derived from the bacterium Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) are planted on millions of hectares annually, reducing the use of conventional insecticides and suppressing pests. However, the evolution of resistance could cut short these benefits. A primary pest targeted by Bt maize in the United States is the western corn rootworm Diabrotica virgifera virgifera (Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae).We report that fields identified by farmers as having severe rootworm feeding injury to Bt maize contained populations of western corn rootworm that displayed significantly higher survival on Cry3Bb1 maize in laboratory bioassays than did western corn rootworm from fields not associated with such feeding injury. In all cases, fields experiencing severe rootworm feeding contained Cry3Bb1 maize. Interviews with farmers indicated that Cry3Bb1 maize had been grown in those fields for at least three consecutive years. There was a significant positive correlation between the number of years Cry3Bb1 maize had been grown in a field and the survival of rootworm populations on Cry3Bb1 maize in bioassays. However, there was no significant correlation among populations for survival on Cry34/35Ab1 maize and Cry3Bb1 maize, suggesting a lack of cross resistance between these Bt toxins.This is the first report of field-evolved resistance to a Bt toxin by the western corn rootworm and by any species of Coleoptera. Insufficient planting of refuges and non-recessive inheritance of resistance may have contributed to resistance. These results suggest that improvements in resistance management and a more integrated approach to the use of Bt crops may be necessary."
https://openalex.org/W2153043340,"Mer tyrosine kinase (MerTK) is an integral membrane protein that is preferentially expressed by phagocytic cells, where it promotes efferocytosis and inhibits inflammatory signaling. Proteolytic cleavage of MerTK at an unidentified site leads to shedding of its soluble ectodomain (soluble MER; sMER), which can inhibit thrombosis in mice and efferocytosis in vitro. Herein, we show that MerTK is cleaved at proline 485 in murine macrophages. Site-directed deletion of 6 amino acids spanning proline 485 rendered MerTK resistant to proteolysis and suppression of efferocytosis by cleavage-inducing stimuli. LPS is a known inducer of MerTK cleavage, and the intracellular signaling pathways required for this action are unknown. LPS/TLR4-mediated generation of sMER required disintegrin and metalloproteinase ADAM17 and was independent of Myd88, instead requiring TRIF adaptor signaling. LPS-induced cleavage was suppressed by deficiency of NADPH oxidase 2 (Nox2) and PKCδ. The addition of the antioxidant N-acetyl cysteine inhibited PKCδ, and silencing of PKCδ inhibited MAPK p38, which was also required. In a mouse model of endotoxemia, we discovered that LPS induced plasma sMER, and this was suppressed by Adam17 deficiency. Thus, a TRIF-mediated pattern recognition receptor signaling cascade requires NADPH oxidase to activate PKCδ and then p38, culminating in ADAM17-mediated proteolysis of MerTK. These findings link innate pattern recognition receptor signaling to proteolytic inactivation of MerTK and generation of sMER and uncover targets to test how MerTK cleavage affects efferocytosis efficiency and inflammation resolution in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W2004658669,"Although polychaetes are one of the dominant taxa in marine communities, their distributions and taxonomic diversity are poorly understood. Recent studies have shown that many species thought to have broad distributions are actually a complex of allied species. In Canada, 12% of polychaete species are thought to occur in Atlantic, Arctic, and Pacific Oceans, but the extent of gene flow among their populations has not been tested.Sequence variation in a segment of the mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase I (COI) gene was employed to compare morphological versus molecular diversity estimates, to examine gene flow among populations of widespread species, and to explore connectivity patterns among Canada's three oceans. Analysis of 1876 specimens, representing 333 provisional species, revealed 40 times more sequence divergence between than within species (16.5% versus 0.38%). Genetic data suggest that one quarter of previously recognized species actually include two or more divergent lineages, indicating that richness in this region is currently underestimated. Few species with a tri-oceanic distribution showed genetic cohesion. Instead, large genetic breaks occur between Pacific and Atlantic-Arctic lineages, suggesting their long-term separation. High connectivity among Arctic and Atlantic regions and low connectivity with the Pacific further supports the conclusion that Canadian polychaetes are partitioned into two distinct faunas.Results of this study confirm that COI sequences are an effective tool for species identification in polychaetes, and suggest that DNA barcoding will aid the recognition of species overlooked by the current taxonomic system. The consistent geographic structuring within presumed widespread species suggests that historical range fragmentation during the Pleistocene ultimately increased Canadian polychaete diversity and that the coastal British Columbia fauna played a minor role in Arctic recolonization following deglaciation. This study highlights the value of DNA barcoding for providing rapid insights into species distributions and biogeographic patterns in understudied groups."
https://openalex.org/W1992263392,"The microbiome of the respiratory tract, including the nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal microbiota, is a dynamic community of microorganisms that is highly diverse. The cystic fibrosis (CF) airway microbiome refers to the polymicrobial communities present in the lower airways of CF patients. It is comprised of chronic opportunistic pathogens (such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa) and a variety of organisms derived mostly from the normal microbiota of the upper respiratory tract. The complexity of these communities has been inferred primarily from culture independent molecular profiling. As with most microbial communities it is generally assumed that most of the organisms present are not readily cultured. Our culture collection generated using more extensive cultivation approaches, reveals a more complex microbial community than that obtained by conventional CF culture methods. To directly evaluate the cultivability of the airway microbiome, we examined six samples in depth using culture-enriched molecular profiling which combines culture-based methods with the molecular profiling methods of terminal restriction fragment length polymorphisms and 16S rRNA gene sequencing. We demonstrate that combining culture-dependent and culture-independent approaches enhances the sensitivity of either approach alone. Our techniques were able to cultivate 43 of the 48 families detected by deep sequencing; the five families recovered solely by culture-independent approaches were all present at very low abundance (<0.002% total reads). 46% of the molecular signatures detected by culture from the six patients were only identified in an anaerobic environment, suggesting that a large proportion of the cultured airway community is composed of obligate anaerobes. Most significantly, using 20 growth conditions per specimen, half of which included anaerobic cultivation and extended incubation times we demonstrate that the majority of bacteria present can be cultured."
https://openalex.org/W2149446634,"A statistically principled way of conducting brain network analysis is still lacking. Comparison of different populations of brain networks is hard because topology is inherently dependent on wiring cost, where cost is defined as the number of edges in an unweighted graph. In this paper, we evaluate the benefits and limitations associated with using cost-integrated topological metrics. Our focus is on comparing populations of weighted undirected graphs that differ in mean association weight, using global efficiency. Our key result shows that integrating over cost is equivalent to controlling for any monotonic transformation of the weight set of a weighted graph. That is, when integrating over cost, we eliminate the differences in topology that may be due to a monotonic transformation of the weight set. Our result holds for any unweighted topological measure, and for any choice of distribution over cost levels. Cost-integration is therefore helpful in disentangling differences in cost from differences in topology. By contrast, we show that the use of the weighted version of a topological metric is generally not a valid approach to this problem. Indeed, we prove that, under weak conditions, the use of the weighted version of global efficiency is equivalent to simply comparing weighted costs. Thus, we recommend the reporting of (i) differences in weighted costs and (ii) differences in cost-integrated topological measures with respect to different distributions over the cost domain. We demonstrate the application of these techniques in a re-analysis of an fMRI working memory task. We also provide a Monte Carlo method for approximating cost-integrated topological measures. Finally, we discuss the limitations of integrating topology over cost, which may pose problems when some weights are zero, when multiplicities exist in the ranks of the weights, and when one expects subtle cost-dependent topological differences, which could be masked by cost-integration."
https://openalex.org/W1986355431,"CD62L/L-selectin is a marker found on naïve T cells and further distinguishes central memory (Tcm, CD62L+) from effector memory (Tem, CD62L−) T cells. The regulation of CD62L plays a pivotal role in controlling the traffic of T lymphocytes to and from peripheral lymph nodes. CD62L is shed from the cell membrane following T cell activation, however, the physiological significance of this event remains to be elucidated. In this study, we utilized in vitro generated anti-tumor antigen T cells and melanoma lines as a model to evaluate the dynamics of CD62L shedding and expression of CD107a as a marker of lytic activity. Upon encounter, with matched tumor lines, antigen reactive T cells rapidly lose CD62L expression and this was associated with the acquisition of CD107a. By CD62L ELISA, we confirmed that this transition was mediated by the shedding of CD62L when T cells encountered specific tumor antigen. The introduction of a shedding resistant mutant of CD62L into the tumor antigen-reactive T cell line JKF6 impaired CD107a acquisition following antigen recognition and this was correlated with decreased lytic activity as measured by 51Cr release assays. The linkage of the shedding of CD62L from the surface of anti-tumor T cells and acquisition of lytic activity, suggests a new function for CD62L in T cell effector functions and anti-tumor activity."
https://openalex.org/W2043996818,"The human gut microbiota is considered one of the most fascinating reservoirs of microbial diversity hosting between 400 to 1000 bacterial species distributed among nine phyla with Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes and Actinobacteria representing around of the diversity. One of the most intriguing issues relates to understanding which microbial groups are active players in the maintenance of the microbiota homeostasis. Here, we describe the diversity of active microbial fractions compared with the whole community from raw human fecal samples. We studied four healthy volunteers by 16S rDNA gene pyrosequencing. The fractions were obtained by cell sorting based on bacterial RNA concentration. Bacterial families were observed to appear or disappear on applying a cell sorting method in which flow cytometry was used to evaluate the active cells by pyronin-Y staining of RNA. This method was able to detect active bacteria, indicating that the active players differed from that observed in raw fecal material. Generally, observations showed that in the active fractions, the number of reads related to Bacteroidetes decreased whereas several families from Clostridiales (Firmicutes) were more highly represented. Moreover, a huge number of families appeared as part of the active fraction when cell sorting was applied, indicating reads that are simply statistically hidden by the total reads."
https://openalex.org/W2014752627,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by brain pathology of intracellular neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) and extracellular amyloid plaques. NFTs contain aberrantly hyperphosphorylated Tau as paired helical filaments (PHFs). Although NFs have been shown immunohistologically to be part of NFTs, there has been debate that the identity of NF proteins in NFTs is due to the cross-reactivity of phosphorylated NF antibodies with phospho-Tau. Here, we provide direct evidence on the identity of NFs in NFTs by immunochemical and mass spectrometric analysis. We have purified sarkosyl-insoluble NFTs and performed liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry of NFT tryptic digests. The phosphoproteomics of NFTs clearly identified NF-M phosphopeptides SPVPKS∗PVEEAK, corresponding to Ser685, and KAES∗PVKEEAVAEVVTITK, corresponding to Ser736, and an NF-H phosphopeptide, EPDDAKAKEPS∗KP, corresponding to Ser942. Western blotting of purified tangles with SMI31 showed a 150-kDa band corresponding to phospho-NF-M, while RT97 antibodies detected phospho-NF-H. The proteomics analysis also identified an NF-L peptide (ALYEQEIR, EAEEEKKVEGAGEEQAAAK) and another intermediate filament protein, vimentin (FADLSEAANR). Mass spectrometry revealed Tau phosphopeptides corresponding to Thr231, Ser235, Thr181, Ser184, Ser185, Thr212, Thr217, Ser396, and Ser403. And finally, phosphopeptides corresponding to MAP1B (corresponding to Ser1270, Ser1274, and Ser1779) and MAP2 (corresponding to Thr350, Ser1702, and Ser1706) were identified. In corresponding matched control preparations of PHF/NFTs, none of these phosphorylated neuronal cytoskeletal proteins were found. These studies independently demonstrate that NF proteins are an integral part of NFTs in AD brains.—Rudrabhatla, P., Jaffe, H., Pant, H. C.

Because modification of PCM influences cell behavior, we investigated molecular mechanisms that regulate PCM volume and composition. In fibroblasts and other cells, aggregates of hyaluronan and versican are found in the PCM. Dermal fibroblasts from Adamts5−/− mice, which lack a versican-degrading protease, ADAMTS5, had reduced versican proteolysis, increased PCM, altered cell shape, enhanced α-smooth muscle actin (SMA) expression and increased contractility within three-dimensional collagen gels. The myofibroblast-like phenotype was associated with activation of TGFβ signaling. We tested the hypothesis that fibroblast-myofibroblast transition in Adamts5−/− cells resulted from versican accumulation in PCM. First, we noted that versican overexpression in human dermal fibroblasts led to increased SMA expression, enhanced contractility, and increased Smad2 phosphorylation. In contrast, dermal fibroblasts from Vcan haploinsufficient (Vcanhdf/+) mice had reduced contractility relative to wild type fibroblasts. Using a genetic approach to directly test if myofibroblast transition in Adamts5−/− cells resulted from increased PCM versican content, we generated Adamts5−/−;Vcanhdf/+ mice and isolated their dermal fibroblasts for comparison with dermal fibroblasts from Adamts5−/− mice. In Adamts5−/− fibroblasts, Vcan haploinsufficiency or exogenous ADAMTS5 restored normal fibroblast contractility. These findings demonstrate that altering PCM versican content through proteolytic activity of ADAMTS5 profoundly influenced the dermal fibroblast phenotype and may regulate a phenotypic continuum between the fibroblast and its alter ego, the myofibroblast. We propose that a physiological function of ADAMTS5 in dermal fibroblasts is to maintain optimal versican content and PCM volume by continually trimming versican in hyaluronan-versican aggregates.

Thus, it is appropriate to view a cell and its PCM as a functional unit. Processes that could potentially be regulated by PCM include macromolecular assembly (e.g. assembly of collagen, fibronectin fibrils, or fibrillin microfibrils), cell surface receptor-ligand interactions, binding of pathogens, and cell-matrix and cell-cell adhesion. PCM is sometimes referred to as the glycocalyx because of its abundant carbohydrate content (3Bennett H.S. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1963; 11: 14-23Crossref Google Scholar). The PCM in many cell types such as chondrocytes, ova, neurons (in which PCM is also termed the perineuronal net), vascular smooth muscle cells, and fibroblasts contains aggregates of hyaluronan (HA) with chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans (CSPG) (4Camaioni A.

These aggregates are formed from non-covalent association of HA with large CSPGs such as aggrecan, versican, brevican, and neurocan. In contrast to the aforementioned cell types, heparan sulfate proteoglycans appear to be a critical component of endothelial and osteocyte PCMs (8Van Teeffelen J.W. Brands J. Stroes E.S. Vink H.

Bone Miner. Res. 2011; 26: 618-629Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). The interaction between HA and the CSPG is stabilized by a link protein, and HA is bound to the cell surface via its receptor CD44 (6Knudson C.B. J.

In cells robustly synthesizing HA, it can also be tethered to HA synthases (11Kultti A. Rilla K. Tiihonen R. Spicer A.P. Tammi R.H. Tammi M.I. J. Biol.

HA and cell surface binding of HA are each crucial for the formation of a robust HA-CSPG-rich PCM, as the PCM is eliminated by treatment of cells with hyaluronidase (1Clarris B.J. Fraser J.R.

The ability of the HA-based PCM to exclude particles is based on the cumulative strong negative charge of HA and CS, which leads to a highly hydrated matrix around the cell that excludes particulate matter but not solutes. PCM is consistently well developed in chondrocytes, and the term chondron is used to describe the chondrocyte and its PCM (12Poole C.A. Flint M.H. Beaumont B.W. J. Orthop. Res. 1987; 5: 509-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Like chondrocytes, which produce endogenous aggrecan, other cells having CD44 have been shown to assemble large PCMs if provided with exogenous aggrecan and HA (6Knudson C.B. J.

Aggrecan is a specialized product of chondrocytes, whereas dermal fibroblasts and vascular smooth muscle cells express a related CSPG named versican (5Evanko S.P. Tammi M.I. Tammi R.H. Wight T.N.

In contrast to PCM assembly, its turnover has not been extensively studied. However, given the dynamic nature of PCM (2Clarris B.J. Fraser J.R. Exp. Cell Res. 1968; 49: 181-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 13Evanko S.P. Angello J.C. Wight T.N. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1999; 19: 1004-1013Crossref PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar), it is likely that PCM components undergo continuous turnover by cell surface-associated or secreted proteases followed by either release or internalization. Versican can be expressed as one of four major splice isoforms. The N- and C-terminal globular domains (G1 and G3 respectively) are present in all isoforms, which differ in whether or not alternatively spliced CS-bearing regions (glycosaminoglycan α (GAGα) and GAGβ) are present. Thus, versican V1 contains only the GAGβ domain, V2 contains only the GAGα domain, V0 contains both CS domains, and neither CS-bearing domain is present in V3. Several ADAMTS proteases (e.g. ADAMTS1, ADAMTS4, ADAMTS5, ADAMTS9, and ADAMTS20) were previously shown to cleave versican at a specific site, Glu441–Ala442 within the GAGβ region of versican V1; the corresponding cleaved peptide bond in versican V0 is located between Glu1428 and Ala1429, as the GAG-β domain lies downstream of the GAGα domain in this isoform (19Longpré J.M.

Proteolysis by these ADAMTS proteases, therefore, has the potential to disrupt the pericellular network formed by versican or to release the CS-bearing regions, resulting in reduced hydration capacity of the PCM. These versican-degrading ADAMTS proteases are all localized in proximity to the cell membrane (22Somerville R.P. Longpre J.M. Jungers K.A. Engle J.M. Ross M. Evanko S. Wight T.N. Leduc R. Apte S.S.

In the present study we determined the consequences of altering the versican content of PCM on dermal fibroblast contractility and investigated the potential role for ADAMTS proteases in versican turnover in the PCM. Because ADAMTS5 has been previously shown to be critical for versican and aggrecan processing and as shown here, is expressed in cultured dermal fibroblasts, we focused on this protease as a tool for modifying versican turnover. Studies described herein using cultured dermal fibroblasts from Adamts5−/− and Vcan-deficient mice suggest a critical role for pericellular versican in regulating cell behavior and also demonstrate that ADAMTS5 has a critical role in versican turnover in fibroblasts. In the presence of excess pericellular versican or when versican turnover is reduced after Adamts5 inactivation, dermal fibroblasts undergo transition to a myofibroblast-like cell, a cellular phenotype that is of high significance for wound healing and fibrosis. Unless otherwise specified, reagents were obtained from Sigma. Mice with targeted inactivation of Adamts5 (B6.129P2-Adamts5tm1Dgen/J, referred to here as Adamts5−/−), were obtained from The Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME). The Adamts5-targeted allele was subsequently backcrossed for 10 consecutive generations into the C57Bl/6 strain so as to be essentially congenic in this strain (25McCulloch D.R. Nelson C.M.

Vcanhdf/hdf mouse embryos die around 9.5 days of gestation; hence, only Vcanhdf/+ mice were used for these studies. Mice were housed in the Biological Resources Unit of the Cleveland Clinic according to a protocol approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee under controlled light/dark and temperature conditions and provided with food and water ad libitum. PCR of DNA obtained from tail biopsies was used for genotyping. Adamts5−/− mice were obtained by breeding hemizygous mice. Adamts5−/−;Vcanhdf/+ mice were obtained by crossing Adamts5−/− and Adamts5+/−;Vcanhdf/+ mice. Animal tissues were obtained at post-mortem after euthanasia, performed as per the recommendations of the American Veterinary Association Panel on Euthanasia. Dermal fibroblasts were isolated from skin by outgrowth from skin explants obtained post-mortem from 3-week-old mice. These were further cultured for at least 5 passages before experimental use. In some experiments cells were cultured for 24 h in the presence of either 500 μm 4-methyumbelliferone (4MU) to suppress HA synthesis or the TGFβ type I receptor (ALK5) inhibitor SB431542 (Sigma, catalogue no. S4317), used at 10 μm to block TGFβ receptor signaling. In these experiments cell viability was determined using the trypan blue assay, and no toxicity of these compounds was seen. For versican overexpression, human neonatal dermal fibroblasts (catalogue no. C0045C: Invitrogen) were transfected with 5 μg of a versican V1 expression plasmid (in pSecTag2 Invitrogen) or with the empty pSecTag2 vector using the Amaxa nucleofector and a human dermal fibroblast nucleofector kit according to the manufacturer's protocols (Lonza Walkersville, Inc, Walkersville, MD). The cells were passaged into 10-cm plates 24 h after transfection and were used in a collagen gel contraction assay (described below) after an additional 48 h in culture. Successful versican transfection was confirmed by Western blotting of cell lysates using rabbit anti-mouse versican polyclonal antibody (1:1000 dilution; catalogue no. AB1033, Millipore Inc, Billerica, MA). To provide a source of exogenous ADAMTS5, we collected the medium from human chondrosarcoma-derived HTB-94 cells (ATCC, Manassas, VA) stably transfected with plasmid constructs expressing active ADAMTS5 (wild type (WT) medium) or catalytically inactive mutant ADAMTS5 having an E441A substitution in the active site (EA medium) and medium from empty vector-transfected cells as the control. Adamts5−/− and WT dermal fibroblasts were cultured with these media (blended 1:1 with fresh medium) for 24 h before analysis. Total RNA was extracted from skin and cultured dermal fibroblasts of 3-week-old WT mice using TRIzol. The RNA was reverse-transcribed using the SuperScript II cDNA synthesis kit (Stratagene, Santa Clara, CA). PCR was done using TaqDNA polymerase (Apex, Genesee Scientific, San Diego, CA) with the following conditions: 95 °C for 2 min, 95 °C for 30 s, 60 °C for 30 s, 72 °C for 30 s for 40 cycles followed by a final extension step of 72 °C for 10 min. ADAMTS oligonucleotide primer sequences were previously published (25McCulloch D.R. Nelson C.M. Dixon L.J. Silver D.L. Wylie J.D. Lindner V. Sasaki T. Cooley M.A. Argraves W.S. Apte S.S. Dev. Cell. 2009; 17: 687-698Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). For RT-PCR analysis of the genes encoding HA synthases Has1, Has2 and Has3, the primer sequences were as previously described (27Cheng G. Swaidani S. Sharma M. Lauer M.E. Hascall V.C. Aronica M.A. Matrix Biol. 2011; 30: 126-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). PCR was done using the following conditions: 95 °C for 2 min, 95 °C for 30 s, 55 °C for 30 s, 72 °C for 30 s for 40 cycles followed by a final extension step of 72 °C for 10 min. PCR products were analyzed by electrophoresis in 2% agarose gels. Cultured fibroblasts were fixed using freshly prepared 4% paraformaldehyde prepared in β-galactosidase wash buffer (0.1 m phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, 2 mm MgCl2, 0.01% sodium deoxycholate, 0.02% (v/v) Nonidet P-40), rinsed in the wash buffer, and incubated for 2 h at 37 °C in β-galactosidase staining solution as previously described (28McCulloch D.R. Le Goff C. Bhatt S. Dixon L.J. Sandy J.D. Apte S.S. Gene Expr. Patterns. 2009; 9: 314-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). After a brief rinse in wash buffer, the fibroblasts were photographed on an inverted microscope. Proliferation of dermal fibroblasts from Adamts5−/− and WT littermates was measured using 5-bromo-2′-deoxyuridine (BrdU) Labeling and Detection Kit III (Roche Applied Science). Cells were serum-starved for 24 h to achieve growth arrest, and the medium was subsequently changed to DMEM containing 1% fetal bovine serum. After 6 h, 10 mm BrdU was added to the medium, and cells were cultured for an additional 42 h before undertaking the assay as per the manufacturer's instructions. For analysis of cell migration, dermal fibroblasts were cultured from dermal explants of 3-week-old Adamts5−/− and WT littermates in DMEM containing 10% FBS. Fibroblasts were grown to confluence on 12-well plates (BD Biosciences). Before the migration assay, they were cultured in serum-free medium overnight and treated for 2 h with 10 ng/ml mitomycin C, an inhibitor of cell proliferation. The confluent monolayer was scratched with a 200-μl polypropylene pipette tip. The resulting “scratch wound” was photographed every 5 min by time-lapse photomicroscopy as previously described (29Koo B.H. Coe D.M. Dixon L.J. Somerville R.P. Nelson C.M. Wang L.W. Young M.E. Lindner D.J. Apte S.S. Am. J. Pathol. 2010; 176: 1494-1504Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Skin of comparable wet weight was isolated from two pairs of Adamts5−/− and WT littermates shortly after death, minced, and extracted with guanidinium chloride as previously described (30Carrino D.A. Sorrell J.M. Caplan A.I. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2000; 373: 91-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Proteoglycans were isolated by step elution anion exchange chromatography on diethylaminoethyl (DEAE)-Sephacel as previously described (30Carrino D.A. Sorrell J.M. Caplan A.I. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2000; 373: 91-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). The step elutions consisted of 0.25 m NaCl (DEAE pool 1) and 1.0 m NaCl (DEAE pool 2). DEAE pool 1 contains HA, some glycoproteins, and also the DPEAAE fragment of versican V1 that lacks CS chains and, therefore, does not bind to DEAE-Sephacel; DEAE pool 2 contains sulfated proteoglycans including versican and the DPEAAE fragment of versican V0 (30Carrino D.A. Sorrell J.M. Caplan A.I. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2000; 373: 91-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 31Carrino D.A. Calabro A. Darr A.B. Dours-Zimmermann M.T. Sandy J.D. Zimmermann D.R. Sorrell J.M. Hascall V.C. Caplan A.I. Glycobiology. 2011; 21: 257-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The amounts of glycosaminoglycans in each of the DEAE pools were determined by the Safranin O assay (32Carrino D.A. Arias J.L. Caplan A.I. Biochem. Int. 1991; 24: 485-495PubMed Google Scholar). Proteoglycans were analyzed on Western blots as done previously (30Carrino D.A. Sorrell J.M. Caplan A.I. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2000; 373: 91-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 31Carrino D.A. Calabro A. Darr A.B. Dours-Zimmermann M.T. Sandy J.D. Zimmermann D.R. Sorrell J.M. Hascall V.C. Caplan A.I. Glycobiology. 2011; 21: 257-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). For SDS-PAGE, equal amounts of total glycosaminoglycans per sample (as determined from the Safranin O assay) were loaded for comparison of Adamts5−/− and WT littermates. DEAE pool 2 was electrophoresed after treatment with chondroitinase ABC to generate core proteins (30Carrino D.A. Sorrell J.M. Caplan A.I. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2000; 373: 91-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 33Oike Y. Kimata K. Shinomura T. Nakazawa K. Suzuki S. Biochem. J. 1980; 191: 193-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). DEAE pool 1 was electrophoresed without prior chondroitinase treatment, as the DPEAAE fragment of V1 lacks CS (31Carrino D.A. Calabro A. Darr A.B. Dours-Zimmermann M.T. Sandy J.D. Zimmermann D.R. Sorrell J.M. Hascall V.C. Caplan A.I. Glycobiology. 2011; 21: 257-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The fluorophore-assisted carbohydrate electrophoresis method for the quantification of HA is described elsewhere (34Lauer M.E. Mukhopadhyay D. Fulop C. de la Motte C.A. Majors A.K. Hascall V.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 5299-5312Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Briefly, the medium was removed, and the cells were washed with PBS followed by digestion with proteinase K. HA was purified by ethanol precipitation, digested to disaccharides with hyaluronidase standard deviation, and labeled with 2-aminoacridone. The samples were electrophoresed on a polyacrylamide gel, and the HA disaccharide band was imaged on an ultraviolet transilluminator and quantified using gel imaging software. Fibroblasts were cultured with 1 μm calcein (catalogue no. C3099, calcein AM; Invitrogen) for 30 min, and the cells were washed and photographed using an inverted, wide-field Leica fluorescence microscope (DM IRB, Heidelberg, Germany), a Q-Imaging CCD camera (Retiga-SRV, Surrey, BC), and a 10× or 20× objective. Morphometric analysis of cell shape parameters was done in batch for all images within a particular group (WT versus littermate) using custom semi-automated scripts generated in Image-Pro Plus v6.2 (Media Cybernetics, Silver Spring, MD). Briefly, for each cell within a given image, a region of interest was created along its boundary using a wand tool (single-click operation by a “blinded” observer). Each region of interest was then used to create a binary cell mask that was subsequently analyzed to extract and automatically export various morphological parameters including area, aspect ratio, roundness, perimeter, convex perimeter, and min/max/mean Feret diameter. Fibroblasts were obtained from WT, Adamts5−/− and Vcanhdf/+ mice. Cell monolayers (including extracellular matrix) were scraped off tissue culture surfaces and lysed in T-PER Tissue Protein Extraction Reagent (Thermo Scientific, Rockford, IL) with protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science). Alternatively, cells were lysed by incubation in 2× Laemmli sample buffer. Lysis in radioimmunoprecipitation buffer (Santa Cruz) was used for sample preparation for Western blotting of phosphorylated proteins. Proteins were separated by reducing SDS-PAGE and transferred to a polyvinylidene fluoride membrane for Western blotting using either enhanced chemiluminescence or a colorimetric method that utilized alkaline phosphatase-conjugated secondary antibody. The following antibodies were used: rabbit polyclonal anti-DPEAAE, which recognizes the new C terminus of the N-terminal versican fragment resulting from cleavage at the Glu441-Ala442 peptide bond, but not uncleaved versican (1:2000 dilution; Affinity BioReagents, Golden, CO), rabbit polyclonal anti-versican GAGβ domain antibody, recognizing intact versican V0 or V1 isoforms (1:1000 dilution; catalogue no. AB1033, Millipore), mouse monoclonal anti-α smooth muscle actin (SMA) antibody (1:1000 dilution; catalogue no. A2547), rabbit polyclonal anti-Smad2/3 antibody (1:1000; catalogue no. 3102 Cell Signaling), rabbit polyclonal anti-pSmad2/3 antibody (1:200; catalogue no. sc-11769, Santa Cruz), rabbit polyclonal anti-fibronectin (Abcam, Cambridge, MA; catalogue no. ab23750), rabbit polyclonal anti-Smad2 antibody (1:1000; catalogue no. 3103 Cell Signaling), rabbit polyclonal anti-pSmad2 antibody (1:1000; catalogue no. 3101 Cell Signaling), rabbit polyclonal anti-ERK antibody (1:200; catalogue no. sc-94; Santa Cruz), rabbit polyclonal anti-pERK antibody (1:200; catalogue no. sc-7383; Santa Cruz), or mouse monoclonal anti-GAPDH antibody (1:300 dilution; catalogue no. MAB374; Millipore). For quantification of Western blot signal intensities, the blots were scanned, and the signal intensities were normalized to GAPDH signal intensities on the same blots. The exclusion of red blood cells (RBCs) was used to visualize PCM. Formalin-fixed sheep RBCs (Inter-Cell Technologies Inc. Jupiter, FL) were washed in PBS followed by centrifugation at 1000 × g for 10 min at least four times. The pellet was resuspended in medium to obtain a concentration of 1.0 × 108 RBCs/ml. Dermal fibroblasts were plated at a sparse (non-confluent) density in 6-well plates in serum-free medium for 24 h, and 200 μl of the RBC suspension was added to each well. The plates were incubated at 37 °C for 15 min to allow the RBCs to settle around the cells. For hyaluronidase digestion, fibroblasts were cultured in the presence or absence of 0.5 units/ml Streptomyces hyaluronidase for 1 h before conducting the particle exclusion assay. For quantification of the area of PCM, images of calcein-labeled cells surrounded by RBCs were acquired using an inverted, wide-field Leica microscope (DM IRB, Heidelberg, Germany), Q-Imaging CCD camera (Retiga-SRV, Surrey, BC), and a 20× objective in both phase-contrast and fluorescence modes. Analysis of “exclusion” regions (void areas surrounding cells in which particles were absent) was performed in batch mode using custom, fully automated scripts generated in Image Pro Plus v6.2 (Media Cybernetics, Silver Spring, MD). Briefly, phase-contrast and corresponding fluorescence images of cells were loaded together into Image Pro. Particles were segmented from the phase-contrast images by applying a “top-hat” morphological filter (which preferentially enhances the central portion of each particle) that enabled application of a fixed intensity threshold. Similarly, binary cell masks were created using a single-value intensity threshold after application of a large spectral high-pass filter. Cell masks were then subtracted from the binarized particle masks to remove any contribution of cell surface-bound particles. Using a “thinning” operation, cell masks were reduced to one-pixel-width medial lines. For every pixel along the cell medial axis, the angle and distance to every particle centroid was calculated (polar coordinate system conversion). Then, for a 360-degree rotation around each medial axis pixel (5-degree steps, 20-degree range), the closest particle location was recorded. After a full rotation around each medial axis point, recorded points were connected to produce the exclusion area around that particular pixel. A final image of the cell exclusion area was generated by repeating this process for the entire medial axis, filling holes, and subtracting the cell area mask. To determine mean exclusion length (exclusion mask thickness), a skeleton of the exclusion mask was multiplied by its Euclidean distance map. Mean exclusion length was then calculated by summing the resultant pixel intensities, dividing b"

We have used the streptomycin mouse model for Salmonella Typhimurium diarrhea to analyze the role of interferon gamma receptor (IFN-γR)-signaling in mucosal defense. IFN-γ is known to contribute to acute S. Typhimurium diarrhea. We have compared the acute mucosal inflammation in IFN-γR-/- mice and wild type animals. IFN-γR-/- mice harbored increased pathogen loads in the mucosal epithelium and the lamina propria. Surprisingly, the epithelium of the IFN-γR-/- mice did not show the dramatic “loss” of mucus-filled goblet cell vacuoles, a hallmark of the wild type mucosal infection. Using bone marrow chimeric mice we established that IFN-γR-signaling in stromal cells (e.g. goblet cells, enterocytes) controlled mucus excretion/vacuole loss by goblet cells. In contrast, IFN-γR-signaling in bone marrow-derived cells (e.g. macrophages, DCs, PMNs) was required for restricting pathogen growth in the gut tissue. Thus IFN-γR-signaling influences different mucosal responses to infection, including not only pathogen restriction in the lamina propria, but, as shown here, also goblet cell function."
https://openalex.org/W2075495945,"The availability of electronic health care records is unlocking the potential for novel studies on understanding and modeling disease co-morbidities based on both phenotypic and genetic data. Moreover, the insurgence of increasingly reliable phenotypic data can aid further studies on investigating the potential genetic links among diseases. The goal is to create a feedback loop where computational tools guide and facilitate research, leading to improved biological knowledge and clinical standards, which in turn should generate better data. We build and analyze disease interaction networks based on data collected from previous genetic association studies and patient medical histories, spanning over 12 years, acquired from a regional hospital. By exploring both individual and combined interactions among these two levels of disease data, we provide novel insight into the interplay between genetics and clinical realities. Our results show a marked difference between the well defined structure of genetic relationships and the chaotic co-morbidity network, but also highlight clear interdependencies. We demonstrate the power of these dependencies by proposing a novel multi-relational link prediction method, showing that disease co-morbidity can enhance our currently limited knowledge of genetic association. Furthermore, our methods for integrated networks of diverse data are widely applicable and can provide novel advances for many problems in systems biology and personalized medicine."
https://openalex.org/W2052238854,"Oscillatory activity can be widely recorded in the cortex and basal ganglia. This activity may play a role not only in the physiology of movement, perception and cognition, but also in the pathophysiology of psychiatric and neurological diseases like schizophrenia or Parkinson's disease. Ketamine administration has been shown to cause an increase in gamma activity in cortical and subcortical structures, and an increase in 150 Hz oscillations in the nucleus accumbens in healthy rats, together with hyperlocomotion. We recorded local field potentials from motor cortex, caudate-putamen (CPU), substantia nigra pars reticulata (SNr) and subthalamic nucleus (STN) in 20 awake rats before and after the administration of ketamine at three different subanesthetic doses (10, 25 and 50 mg/Kg), and saline as control condition. Motor behavior was semiautomatically quantified by custom-made software specifically developed for this setting. Ketamine induced coherent oscillations in low gamma (50 Hz), high gamma (80 Hz) and high frequency (HFO, 150 Hz) bands, with different behavior in the four structures studied. While oscillatory activity at these three peaks was widespread across all structures, interactions showed a different pattern for each frequency band. Imaginary coherence at 150 Hz was maximum between motor cortex and the different basal ganglia nuclei, while low gamma coherence connected motor cortex with CPU and high gamma coherence was more constrained to the basal ganglia nuclei. Power at three bands correlated with the motor activity of the animal, but only coherence values in the HFO and high gamma range correlated with movement. Interactions in the low gamma band did not show a direct relationship to movement. These results suggest that the motor effects of ketamine administration may be primarily mediated by the induction of coherent widespread high-frequency activity in the motor circuit of the basal ganglia, together with a frequency-specific pattern of connectivity among the structures analyzed."
https://openalex.org/W2026777980,"Background GMZ2 is a fusion protein of Plasmodium falciparum merozoite surface protein 3 (MSP3) and glutamate rich protein (GLURP) that mediates an immune response against the blood stage of the parasite. Two previous phase I clinical trials, one in naïve European adults and one in malaria-exposed Gabonese adults showed that GMZ2 was well tolerated and immunogenic. Here, we present data on safety and immunogenicity of GMZ2 in one to five year old Gabonese children, a target population for future malaria vaccine efficacy trials. Methodology/Principal Findings Thirty children one to five years of age were randomized to receive three doses of either 30 µg or 100 µg of GMZ2, or rabies vaccine. GMZ2, adjuvanted in aluminum hydroxide, was administered on Days 0, 28 and 56. All participants received a full course of their respective vaccination and were followed up for one year. Both 30 µg and 100 µg GMZ2 vaccine doses were well tolerated and induced antibodies and memory B-cells against GMZ2 as well as its antigenic constituents MSP3 and GLURP. After three doses of vaccine, the geometric mean concentration of antibodies to GMZ2 was 19-fold (95%CI: 11,34) higher in the 30 µg GMZ2 group than in the rabies vaccine controls, and 16-fold (7,36) higher in the 100 µg GMZ2 group than the rabies group. Geometric mean concentration of antibodies to MSP3 was 2.7-fold (1.6,4.6) higher in the 30 µg group than in the rabies group and 3.8-fold (1.5,9.6) higher in the 100 µg group. Memory B-cells against GMZ2 developed in both GMZ2 vaccinated groups. Conclusions/Significance Both 30 µg as well as 100 µg intramuscular GMZ2 are immunogenic, well tolerated, and safe in young, malaria-exposed Gabonese children. This result confirms previous findings in naïve and malaria-exposed adults and supports further clinical development of GMZ2. Trial Registration ClinicalTrials.gov NCT00703066"
https://openalex.org/W2114966729,"Biogenic amines have been demonstrated to protect cells from apoptotic cell death. Herein we show for the first time that serotonin and dopamine increase H(2)S production by the endogenous enzyme cystathionine-β-synthase (CBS) and protect cells against hypothermia/rewarming induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) formation and apoptosis. Treatment with both compounds doubled CBS expression through mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) and increased H(2)S production in cultured rat smooth muscle cells. In addition, serotonin and dopamine treatment significantly reduced ROS formation. The beneficial effect of both compounds was minimized by inhibition of their re-uptake and by pharmacological inhibition of CBS or its down-regulation by siRNA. Exogenous administration of H(2)S and activation of CBS by Prydoxal 5'-phosphate also protected cells from hypothermic damage. Finally, serotonin and dopamine pretreatment of rat lung, kidney, liver and heart prior to 24 h of hypothermia at 3°C followed by 30 min of rewarming at 37°C upregulated the expression of CBS, strongly reduced caspase activity and maintained the physiological pH compared to untreated tissues. Thus, dopamine and serotonin protect cells against hypothermia/rewarming induced damage by increasing H(2)S production mediated through CBS. Our data identify a novel molecular link between biogenic amines and the H(2)S pathway, which may profoundly affect our understanding of the biological effects of monoamine neurotransmitters."
https://openalex.org/W2026773319,"We recently demonstrated that plasma membrane KCa3.1 is rapidly endocytosed and targeted for lysosomal degradation via a Rab7- and ESCRT-dependent pathway. Herein, we assess the role of ubiquitylation in this process. Using a biotin ligase acceptor peptide (BLAP)-tagged KCa3.1, in combination with tandem ubiquitin binding entities (TUBEs), we demonstrate that KCa3.1 is polyubiquitylated following endocytosis. Hypertonic sucrose inhibited KCa3.1 endocytosis and resulted in a significant decrease in channel ubiquitylation. Inhibition of the ubiquitin-activating enzyme (E1) with UBEI-41 resulted in reduced KCa3.1 ubiquitylation and internalization. The general deubiquitylase (DUB) inhibitor, PR-619 attenuated KCa3.1 degradation, indicative of deubiquitylation being required for lysosomal delivery. Using the DUB Chip, a protein microarray containing 35 DUBs, we demonstrate a time-dependent association between KCa3.1 and USP8 following endocytosis, which was confirmed by coimmunoprecipitation. Further, overexpression of wild-type USP8 accelerates channel deubiquitylation, while either a catalytically inactive mutant USP8 or siRNA-mediated knockdown of USP8 enhanced accumulation of ubiquitylated KCa3.1, thereby inhibiting channel degradation. In summary, by combining BLAP-tagged KCa3.1 with TUBEs and DUB Chip methodologies, we demonstrate that polyubiquitylation mediates the targeting of membrane KCa3.1 to the lysosomes and also that USP8 regulates the rate of KCa3.1 degradation by deubiquitylating KCa3.1 prior to lysosomal delivery.—Balut, C.

Proteins targeted for ubiquitination are attached with either a single Ub or a poly-Ub chain, formed by the coupling of Ub molecules via one of the seven Lys residues or the N terminus of the first Ub molecule and the C terminus of the second. The poly-Ub chain via the Lys-48 is known to act as a degradation signal, which is recognized by the proteasome and consequently leads to the degradation of the ubiquitinated protein. Lys-63 linkage of the poly-Ub chains is involved in nonproteolytic regulation such as signal transduction, damaged DNA repair (3Pickart C.M. Fushman D. Curr. Opin. Chem.

Privé G.G. Genome Biol. 2005; 6: R82Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and some of them have been related to substrate targeting in Cul3 complexes. BTB proteins bind to Cul3 through the BTB domain and the adjacent “3-box (Cul3-interacting box)” region, an element involved in facilitating this interaction (20Zhuang M. Calabrese M.F. Liu J. Waddell M.B. Nourse A. Hammel M. Miller D.J. Walden H. Duda D.M. Seyedin S.N. Hoggard T. Harper J.W. White K.P. Schulman B.A. Mol.

While interacting with Cul3, BTB proteins recruit substrates with their additional protein-protein interaction domain, such as the Kelch and MATH domains. Of the BTBs involved in ubiquitination processes, the BTB-Kelch protein Keap1 is the best characterized. By regulating the turnover of the transcription factor Nrf2, Keap1 has an important role in the cellular defense mechanism for oxidative and xenobiotic stresses (21Itoh K. Wakabayashi N. Katoh Y.

Recently, three disease-causing missense mutations in the BACK domain of KLHL7, a BTB-Kelch protein, were found in patients with autosomal dominant retinitis pigmentosa (adRP) (26Friedman J.S.

Retinitis pigmentosa is a genetically heterogeneous group of progressive retinal dystrophies, resulting in degeneration of rod and cone photoreceptors. Patients experience night blindness and visual field loss, often leading to complete blindness. Retinitis pigmentosa can be inherited in an autosomal dominant, autosomal recessive, and X-linked manner (28Hartong D.T. Berson E.L. Dryja T.P.

Here, we report that KLHL7 forms Cul3-KLHL7 Ub E3 ligase in cells and that an adRP causative mutation, A153V, leads to the attenuation of the E3 ligase activity of Cul3-KLHL7 in a dominant negative manner. Our results provide molecular insights into the function of KLHL7 and the outcome of an adRP-causative mutation. Epitope-tagged full-length KLHL7 was amplified from human placenta cDNA library using Phusion DNA polymerase (Finnzymes) and cloned into EcoRI and NotI sites of pcDNA3 or pEFBOS (−) vectors. Cul3 and Ub were generated likewise and cloned into EcoRI and XhoI sites. Deletion mutants of KLHL7 were generated by a PCR-based method. The S150N, A153V, and A153T amino acid substitutions were introduced by QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis method using overlapping primers. The PCR-amplified coding regions of Cul3, KLHL7 (wild-type and mutants), and Ub were verified by sequence analyses. HCT116 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (low glucose) (Wako) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 1% nonessential amino acid solution (Invitrogen), and 1% penicillin/streptomycin (Invitrogen) in a 37 °C incubator with 5% CO2. HeLa cells were cultured as above without nonessential amino acid solution. ATG5+/+:GFP-LC3 and ATG5−/−:GFP-LC3 mouse embryo fibroblasts (30Kuma A. Matsui M. Mizushima N. Autophagy. 2007; 3: 323-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar) were cultured in medium without nonessential amino acid solution, supplemented with 0.8% puromycin. Transfections were carried out using FuGENE 6 transfection reagent (Roche Applied Science), Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen), or Multifectam (Promega) according to the manufacturers' specifications. For proteasome inhibition, cells were treated with MG132 (benzyloxycarbonyl-Leu-Leu-Leu-H) (Peptide Institute) for 1 h at 20 μm. For lysosome inhibition, cells were treated with NH4Cl (Wako) for 1 h at 10 mm. The following antibodies were used for immunoblot analyses: anti-FLAG monoclonal (Sigma, M2), rabbit polyclonal (Rockland), anti-HA monoclonal (Covance, HA. 11), polyclonal (Bethyl), anti-c-Myc monoclonal (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, 9E10), and anti-Cul3 rabbit polyclonal antibodies. Anti-Cul3 antibody was raised using recombinant His-tagged Cul3. Anti-Roc1 rabbit polyclonal antibody has been described previously (31Kawakami T. Chiba T. Suzuki T. Iwai K. Yamanaka K. Minato N. Suzuki H. Shimbara N. Hidaka Y. Osaka F. Omata M. Tanaka K. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 4003-4012Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). Peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit and anti-mouse antibodies (Jackson ImmunoResearch) were used as secondary antibodies. For immunocytochemical analyses, anti-FLAG (Sigma, M2), anti-HA rabbit polyclonal (Bethyl), anti-multi-Ub (MBL, FK2), anti-Ub Lys-48-specific (Millipore, Apu2), anti-Ub Lys63-specific (Millipore, Apu3), and anti-GFP rabbit polyclonal (MBL) were used with Alexa Fluor 488- and Alexa Fluor 568-conjugated anti-rabbit and anti-mouse antibodies (Invitrogen). Cells were lysed with ice-cold lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5% CHAPS (Sigma), 1 mm dithiothreitol (DTT)). The supernatant was subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-FLAG M2-agarose or anti-HA-agarose beads (Sigma) and incubated at 4 °C overnight. The beads were then washed with lysis buffer containing 750 mm NaCl and 0.2% CHAPS. The protein samples were added to SDS sample buffer, boiled for 5 min, and immunoblotted using Western Lightning Plus-EDL reagent (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). HeLa cells were cultured on coverslips and were transfected with various expression plasmids. The cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 10 min, permeabilized and blocked in 0.5% Triton X-100, 5% BSA in PBS for 30 min. The coverslips were then immersed in primary antibodies diluted in 5% BSA in PBS followed by secondary immunofluorescent antibodies diluted in 5% BSA in PBS. Nuclei were stained with Hoechst 33342 (Invitrogen). The coverslips were mounted onto slides using Fluoromount/Plus mounting solution (Diagnostic BioSystems), and images were obtained using a fluorescent microscope (Keyence model BZ-9000). Cul3-KLHL7 complex was immunoprecipitated from cells expressing FLAG-KLHL7 and eluted in 1× FLAG peptide (Sigma) in TBS. The purified protein was incubated at 30 °C for 1 or 2 h with 10 μg of Ub (Sigma), 0.2 μl of Ub-activating enzyme UBE1 (Boston Biochem), 0.2 μg of Ub-conjugating enzyme His-UBC4 purified from Escherichia coli, in reaction buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm DTT) either with or without 5 mm ATP at the final volume of 50 μl. The reaction was stopped by the addition of SDS sample buffer, followed by boiling for 5 min at 100 °C. The reaction mixtures were then subjected to immunoblot analyses with anti-multi-Ub (MBL, FK2) antibody to assess poly-Ub chain formation. Some BTB-BACK-Kelch proteins have been reported to function as the substrate recognition subunits of Cul3-based CRLs. However, whether KLHL7 associates with Cul3 or functions as an E3 ligase is unknown. To investigate whether KLHL7 forms a Cul3-based complex, we expressed FLAG-tagged KLHL7 in HCT116 cells and immunoprecipitated the cell lysates using anti-FLAG antibody. As shown in Fig. 1A, Cul3 and Roc1 were co-immunoprecipitated with FLAG-KLHL7, indicating that KLHL7 forms a Cul3 complex. To characterize the domain of KLHL7 involved in the interaction with Cul3, KLHL7 mutants lacking each domain were constructed (Fig. 1B). Wild-type KLHL7 and the mutant lacking the Kelch domain, which still has the BTB and BACK domains, were able to bind to Cul3. Conversely, the ΔBTB, ΔBTB-BACK, and ΔBACK mutants lacking either or both the BTB and the BACK domains could not (Fig. 1C). These results suggest that KLHL7 associates with Cul3 via its BTB and the BACK domains, and both are required for Cul3 binding. Next, to examine the subcellular localization of KLHL7 and Cul3, HeLa cells transfected with FLAG-KLHL7 and HA-Cul3 were subjected to immunocytochemical analyses. As shown in Fig. 1D, KLHL7 was mostly present as punctate structures that were also positive for Cul3 staining. Although most of KLHL7 was associated with Cul3, not all of the Cul3-positive signals were stained with KLHL7, suggesting that only a subset of Cul3 is associated with KLHL7. Furthermore, the punctate structures were not formed by any of the deletion mutants, including the ΔKelch mutant (supplemental Fig. 1), indicating that Cul3 interaction is not sufficient for punctate formation. These results indicate that KLHL7 co-localizes with Cul3, and all of the domains are necessary for the punctate subcellular localization. Several members of the BTB family proteins, such as Keap1 and SPOP, form homodimers (20Zhuang M. Calabrese M.F. Liu J. Waddell M.B. Nourse A. Hammel M. Miller D.J. Walden H. Duda D.M. Seyedin S.N.

Sato C. Yamamoto M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2010; 107: 2842-2847Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). To investigate whether KLHL7 dimerize, HA-tagged wild-type KLHL7 was co-expressed with FLAG-tagged KLHL7 wild-type or deletion mutants into HCT116 cells, and their interactions were assessed by immunoprecipitation experiments, as shown in Fig. 1E. As expected, wild-type KLHL7 could homodimerize. The ΔBACK and ΔKelch mutants could still interact with wild-type KLHL7, whereas deletion of the BTB domain led to weak interaction, which was further weakened by the additional deletion of the BACK domain. These results suggest that the BTB domain is the primary domain necessary for KLHL7 dimerization, whereas the BACK domain, which is not essential for dimerization, is important for efficient dimerization. Because the ΔBACK mutant that could not interact with Cul3 (Fig. 1C) was still able to dimerize (Fig. 1E), the dimer formation of KLHL7 is not mediated indirectly by Cul3 interaction. Because KLHL7 forms Cul3-based complexes, we next investigated whether Cul3-KLHL7 has Ub ligase activity. If KLHL7 is indeed a part of a Ub ligase complex, the substrates of KLHL7 should accumulate in the ubiquitinated form when the proteasome is inhibited. To test this, HCT116 cells were transfected with FLAG-KLHL7 and HA-Ub and treated with the proteasome inhibitor MG132 prior to immunoprecipitation. Immunoblot analyses with anti-HA antibody showed that ubiquitinated proteins interact with FLAG-KLHL7, and its amount increased drastically with proteasome inhibition (Fig. 2A). These data suggest that the ubiquitinated proteins that interacted with KLHL7 are targeted for proteasome degradation. There are several possibilities as to what the ubiquitinated proteins that accumulated with proteasome inhibition are. As strong bands were observed at the predicted molecular weight of ubiquitinated KLHL7 (∼70 kDa), it may be possible that KLHL7 itself is a target. However, ubiquitin positive bands were also observed below the predicted molecular weight of ubiquitinated KLHL7, suggesting that those ubiquitinated proteins represent the authentic substrates of KLHL7. To test whether KLHL7 is indeed self-ubiquitinated, we examined the ubiquitinated state of KLHL7 by detecting FLAG-KLHL7 after HA-Ub immunoprecipitation. After proteasome inhibition, cell lysates of HCT116 cells expressing HA-Ub and FLAG-KLHL7 were immunoprecipitated with anti-HA antibody and subsequently immunoblotted with anti-FLAG antibody to detect ubiquitinated KLHL7 (Fig. 2B). A single band of the estimated molecular weight of mono-ubiquitinated KLHL7 was strongly detected, whereas no ladder or smear was observed, indicating that the majority of KLHL7 is only present as the mono-ubiquitinated form. These results suggest that the increase of Ub moiety associated with KLHL7 upon proteasome inhibition is mostly due to the accumulation of polyubiquitinated authentic substrates. We next examined the ligase activity of Cul3-KLHL7, in a substrate-independent in vitro ubiquitination assay (33Ohta T. Michel J.J. Schottelius A.J. Xiong Y. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 535-541Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar, 34Tan P. Fuchs S.Y. Chen A. Wu K. Gomez C. Ronai Z. Pan Z.Q. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 527-533Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). Cul3-KLHL7, purified from HCT116 cells by immunoprecipitation, was incubated with Ub-activating enzyme E1, Ub-conjugating enzyme E2, and Ub in buffers with or without ATP (Fig. 2C). The amount of poly-Ub chain increased in a time-dependent manner, indicating that Cul3-KLHL7 has E3 ligase activity. KLHL7 and Cul3 co-localized in punctate structures in the cytoplasm (Fig. 1D). KLHL7 also interacted with Ub, which increased with proteasome inhibition (Fig. 2A). Therefore, we next sought to find out whether the KLHL7 puncta co-localize with Ub upon proteasome inhibition. Immunocytochemical analyses using the FK2 anti-multi-Ub antibody, which recognizes poly-Ub chains and polyubiquitinated substrates, indicated that KLHL7 co-localized with ubiquitinated proteins, and the co-localizing structures increased with proteasome inhibition (Fig. 3A). Similar analyses were done with Lys-48-linked Ub chain-specific antibody, and the co-localization of KLHL7 with Lys-48-linked Ub chain increased with proteasome inhibition (Fig. 3B). However, no co-localization of KLHL7 with Lys-63-linked Ub was seen, regardless of proteasome inhibition (Fig. 3C). These results show that KLHL7 co-localizes with Lys-48-linked polyubiquitinated proteins but not with those with Lys-63-linked polyubiquitin, suggesting that KLHL7 mediates the linkage of Lys-48-linked but not Lys-63-linked polyubiquitin chain onto target proteins. The increase in poly-Ub and Lys-48-linked Ub-positive KLHL7 puncta with proteasome inhibition indicate that the substrates ubiquitinated by KLHL7 are targeted for proteasomal degradation. Ubiquitinated proteins can also be processed by the lysosome through the autophagic pathway. To investigate if the substrate of KLHL7 is also degraded by the lysosome, the co-localization of KLHL7 and Ub was examined under NH4Cl treatment (Fig. 4, A and B). In contrast to proteasome inhibition, no accumulation in Ub-positive KLHL7 puncta was seen with lysosome inhibition with NH4Cl. Furthermore, the involvement of the autophagic pathway was assessed by the co-localization of KLHL7 with GFP-tagged autophagosome marker LC3. To test this, we used ATG5+/+:GFP-LC3 and autophagy-deficient ATG5−/−:GFP-LC3 mouse embryo fibroblasts as negative control. No increase in the co-localization of KLHL7 with GFP-LC3 could be seen with MG132 or NH4Cl treatment, regardless of the increase in GFP-LC3 dots with lysosome inhibition (supplemental Fig. 2). Taken together, these data suggest that KLHL7-associated ubiquitinated proteins are processed mostly, if not all, by the proteasome and not the lysosome or LC3-dependent autophagy. Recently, three missense mutations, S150N, A153T, and A153V in KLHL7 were found in patients with adRP. All of these mutations are in the BACK domain, and although both Ser-150 and Ala-153 are conserved within vertebrate KLHL7 (supplemental Fig. 3A), only Ala-153 is conserved within other human BTB-BACK-Kelch proteins (supplemental Fig. 3B). As the BACK domain is necessary for the interaction with Cul3 but not for KLHL7 dimerization (Fig. 1, B, C, and E), we examined if these mutants interact with Cul3 in HCT116 cells. KLHL7 S150N could still interact with Cul3 (Fig. 5A, 4th lane), whereas the A153V and A153T mutants could not (Fig. 5A, 2nd and 3rd lanes). We also investigated the subcellular localization of these missense mutations and their co-localization with Cul3. Immunocytochemical analyses in HeLa cells showed that KLHL7 S150N has similar subcellular localization with wild-type KLHL7 and co-localizes with Cul3 (supplemental Fig. 4, top). On the contrary, the subcellular localization of A153V and A153T was more peripheral than that of wild-type KLHL7, and co-localization with Cul3 was not as prominent (Figs. 1D, 5B, and supplemental Fig. 4, bottom). Taken together, these data suggest that Ala-153 mutations in KLHL7 attenuate its interaction and co-localization with Cul3. We next examined if the mutation in the Ala-153 position affects the dimerization ability of KLHL7 by using the A153V mutant, as the BACK domain was important for efficient dimerization (Fig. 1E). We expressed FLAG-KLHL7 wild-type or A153V with HA-KLHL7 wild-type or A153V in HCT116 cells and immunoprecipitated the cell lysates with anti-FLAG antibody. KLHL7 A153V was able to form both a homodimer and a heterodimer with wild-type KLHL7 (Fig. 5C). The S150N and A153T mutants could also bind to wild-type KLHL7 (supplemental Fig. 5A). These data suggest that none of the adRP-causative mutations interfere with KLHL7 dimerization. Immunocytochemical analyses showed that when both wild-type KLHL7 and A153V were expressed in HeLa cells, co-localization was observed in perinuclear punctate structures, resembling the subcellular localization of wild-type KLHL7 (Fig. 5D). These data indicate that the subcellular localization of KLHL7 A153V seems to be restored to that of wild-type KLHL7 by forming a heterodimer. As KLHL7 A153V associates with wild-type KLHL7 but not directly with Cul3, we next examined the possibility that the heterodimerization of KLHL7 A153V with wild-type KLHL7 inhibits the formation of the Cul3-KLHL7 complex. To examine this, we co-expressed KLHL7 A153V with wild-type KLHL7 and investigated the amount of Cul3 that co-immunoprecipitate with wild-type KLHL7 (Fig. 6A). Contrary to our expectations, the co-immunoprecipitation of Cul3 did not decrease even when KLHL7 A153V was co-expressed (Fig. 6A, IP: FLAG, 2nd and 3rd lanes). Moreover, a slight amount of Cul3 could be co-immunoprecipitated by KLHL7 A153V when the wild-type KLHL7 was co-expressed (Fig. 6A, IP: HA, 1st and 3rd lanes). Similarly, A153T was also able to associate with Cul3 by the co-expression of wild-type KLHL7 (supplemental Fig. 5B). Taken together, it seems that although KLHL7 A153V cannot directly interact with Cul3, the mutation in one molecule of the KLHL7 dimer does not inhibit the assembly of Cul3-KLHL7 in a dominant negative manner. To understand the effect of KLHL7 with mutations in Ala-153 in the Cul3-KLHL7 complex, we next assessed whether the incorporation of KLHL7 A153V affects the E3 ligase activity of Cul3-KLHL7. FLAG-KLHL7 and HA-Ub were transfected with increasing amounts of 6Myc-KLHL7 A153V, and ubiquitinated proteins associated with FLAG-KLHL7 were examined. Under proteasome inhibition, the amount of Ub that associated with wild-type KLHL7 decreased in proportion to the co-expressed KLHL7 A153V, even though there was no change in the amount of co-immunoprecipitated Cul3 and FLAG-KLHL7 (Fig. 6B). These data indicate that the A153V mutant decreases the E3 activity of Cul3-KLHL7. In this study, we have shown that KLHL7 dimerizes and forms a novel Cul3-based E3 ligase. Although the RP-causative KLHL7 S150N mutant did not have obvious effects, and remains to be further investigated, our study provides insights into how the Ala-153 mutations affect the ligase activity of Cul3-KLHL7. The A153V and A153T mutants have the putative substrate-binding Kelch, and the dimerization BTB domains intact. Therefore, it is conceivable that the homodimers would be able to bind onto its authentic substrate. As the Ala-153 mutants could not directly associate with Cul3, the substrate bound to the mutant homodimer would not be recruited to the Cul3-Roc1 complex for ubiquitination (Fig. 6C, right). The subcellular localization of A153V and A153T mutants differed from that of wild type, suggesting that Cul3 binding and subsequent ubiquitination of the substrate may regulate the subcellular localization of KLHL7. Consistent with this notion, none of the deletion mutants formed such punctate structures (supplemental Fig. 1), including the ΔKelch mutant that associates with Cul3. Although KLHL7 A153V and A153T mutants did not interact with Cul3, co-expression of wild-type KLHL7 enabled the mutants to associate with Cul3. Furthermore, the subcellular localization of KLHL7 A153V returned to normal appearance with the co-expression of wild-type KLHL7. These results suggest that the mutants can be incorporated into the Cul3 complex through the dimerization with wild-type KLHL7. However, the amount of ubiquitinated proteins associated with Cul3-KLHL7 greatly diminished when the A153V mutant was present in the complex. This decrease in the ligase activity of Cul3-KLHL7 can be attributed to the change in the conformation of the complex. As the heterodimer would only be able to recruit one molecule of Cul3 with the wild-type KLHL7, the overall number of the catalytic subunit Roc1 incorporated in the Cul3-KLHL7 complex will decrease (Fig. 6C, left and middle panels). Several previous studies have also shown that CRLs take dynamic conformations (35Duda D.M. Borg L.A. Scott D.C. Hunt H.W. Hammel M. Schulman B.A. Cell. 2008; 134: 995-1006Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (558) Google Scholar, 36Merlet J. Burger J. Gomes J.E. Pintard L. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2009; 66: 1924-1938Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar), the flexibility of which may be rate-limiting for ligase activity. Dimerizations of substrate recognition proteins may influence the positioning of the substrate within the complex, as suggested by the analysis of the F-box protein Cdc4. The dimerization of Cdc4 does not influence the affinity with its substrate Sic1, but it seems to influence the positioning of the substrate within the ligase complex (37Tang X. Orlicky S. Lin Z. Willems A. Neculai D. Ceccarelli D. Mercurio F. Shilton B.H. Sicheri F. Tyers M. Cell. 2007; 129: 1165-1176Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). KLHL7 may function likewise, and the incorporation of the Ala-153 mutant into the Cul3-KLHL7 complex may result in a change in the flexibility or the correct positioning of the substrate, necessary for efficient substrate ubiquitination. The attenuation of Cul3-KLHL7 ligase activity by homo- and heterodimers of mutant KLHL7 will lead to the accumulation of the substrates, which could result in cellular toxicity. Cul3-KLHL7 formed punctate structures that resemble vesicles or inclusion bodies. Inclusion bodies, which seclude misfolded or unnecessary proteins, are degraded by the proteasome and autophagic pathways (38Kubota H. J. Biochem. 2009; 146: 609-616Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). In our study, Lys-48-linked poly-Ub-positive KLHL7 puncta increased with proteasome inhibition, suggesting that proteins ubiquitinated by Cul3-KLHL7 are degraded by the proteasome. However, the puncta did not increase with NH4Cl treatment (Fig. 4) nor co-localize with the autophagosome marker LC3 (supplemental Fig. 2) and the lysosome marker LAMP1 (data not shown), making it unlikely that these puncta are processed by the lysosomal pathways. RP is a heterogeneous disease, which is caused by defects in different biochemical cascades (28Hartong D.T. Berson E.L. Dryja T.P. Lancet. 2006; 368: 1795-1809Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2188) Google Scholar, 29Daiger S.P. Bowne S.J. Sullivan L.S. Arch.

KLHL7 may be involved in the regulation of any of these processes, however, how it is involved remains to be elucidated. In summary, we present KLHL7 as a novel substrate recognition subunit of a Cul3-based Ub ligase complex. Moreover, we have shown that the adRP causative A153V mutation inhibits the ligase activity of Cul3-KLHL7 in a dominant negative manner. Future studies should focus on determining the substrate and the components of the Cul3-KLHL7 puncta, which will undoubtedly become the key to understanding the physiological role of KLHL7.

https://openalex.org/W2007842740,"Background Alignment analysis of the Vv-miRNAs identified from various grapevine cultivars indicates that over 30% orthologous Vv-miRNAs exhibit a 1–3 nucleotide discrepancy only at their ends, suggesting that this sequence discrepancy is not a random event, but might mainly derive from divergence of cultivars. With advantages of miR-RACE technology in determining precise sequences of potential miRNAs from bioinformatics prediction, the precise sequences of vv-miRNAs predicted computationally can be verified with miR-RACE in a different grapevine cultivar. This presents itself as a new approach for large scale discovery of precise miRNAs in different grapevine varieties. Methodology/Principal Findings Among 88 unique sequences of Vv-miRNAs from bioinformatics prediction, 83 (96.3%) were successfully validated with MiR-RACE in grapevine cv. ‘Summer Black’. All the validated sequences were identical to their corresponding ones obtained from deep sequencing of the small RNA library of ‘Summer Black’. Quantitative RT-PCR analysis of the expressions levels of 10 Vv-miRNA/target gene pairs in grapevine tissues showed some negative correlation trends. Finally, comparison of Vv-miRNA sequences with their orthologs in Arabidopsis and study on the influence of divergent bases of the orthologous miRNAs on their targeting patterns in grapevine were also done. Conclusion The validation of precise sequences of potential Vv-miRNAs from computational prediction in a different grapevine cultivar can be a new way to identify the orthologous Vv-miRNAs. Nucleotide discrepancy of orthologous Vv-miRNAs from different grapevine cultivars normally does not change their target genes. However, sequence variations of some orthologous miRNAs in grapevine and Arabidopsis can change their targeting patterns. These precise Vv-miRNAs sequences validated in our study could benefit some further study on grapevine functional genomics."
https://openalex.org/W2017663613,"Wolbachia pipientis are intracellular symbiotic bacteria extremely common in various organisms including Drosophila melanogaster, and are known for their ability to induce changes in host reproduction. These bacteria are present in astral microtubule-associated vesicular structures in host cytoplasm, but little is known about the identity of these vesicles. We report here that Wolbachia are restricted only to a group of Golgi-related vesicles concentrated near the site of membrane biogenesis and minus-ends of microtubules. The Wolbachia vesicles were significantly mislocalized in mutant embryos defective in cell/planar polarity genes suggesting that cell/tissue polarity genes are required for apical localization of these Golgi-related vesicles. Furthermore, two of the polarity proteins, Van Gogh/Strabismus and Scribble, appeared to be present in these Golgi-related vesicles. Thus, establishment of polarity may be closely linked to the precise insertion of Golgi vesicles into the new membrane addition site."
https://openalex.org/W2028682583,"Background The associations between pathogens and their hosts are complex and can result from any combination of evolutionary events such as codivergence, switching, and duplication of the pathogen. Mycoviruses are RNA viruses which infect fungi and for which natural vectors are so far unknown. Thus, lateral transfer might be improbable and codivergence their dominant mode of evolution. Accordingly, mycoviruses are a suitable target for statistical tests of virus-host codivergence, but inference of mycovirus phylogenies might be difficult because of low sequence similarity even within families. Methodology We analyzed here the evolutionary dynamics of all mycovirus families by comparing virus and host phylogenies. Additionally, we assessed the sensitivity of the co-phylogenetic tests to the settings for inferring virus trees from their genome sequences and approximate, taxonomy-based host trees. Conclusions While sequence alignment filtering modes affected branch support, the overall results of the co-phylogenetic tests were significantly influenced only by the number of viruses sampled per family. The trees of the two largest families, Partitiviridae and Totiviridae, were significantly more similar to those of their hosts than expected by chance, and most individual host-virus links had a significant positive impact on the global fit, indicating that codivergence is the dominant mode of virus diversification. However, in this regard mycoviruses did not differ from closely related viruses sampled from non-fungus hosts. The remaining virus families were either dominated by other evolutionary modes or lacked an apparent overall pattern. As this negative result might be caused by insufficient taxon sampling, the most parsimonious hypothesis still is that host-parasite evolution is basically the same in all mycovirus families. This is the first study of mycovirus-host codivergence, and the results shed light not only on how mycovirus biology affects their co-phylogenetic relationships, but also on their presumable host range itself."

Recently, we identified the homomeric α7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (α7-nAChR) as one possible functional target for picomolar Aβ. This study was aimed at addressing which residues in α7-nAChRs potentially interact with Aβ to regulate the presynaptic function of this receptor. Site-directed mutagenesis was carried out to study the key aromatic residues in the mouse α7-nAChR agonist-binding pocket. Mutations of tyrosine188 resulted in a decrease in activation of presynaptic α7-nAChRs by ACh and Aβ but with no change in response to nicotine, indicating the critical role of Tyr-188 in presynaptic regulation by Aβ. Coimmunoprecipitation additionally revealed direct binding of Aβ to α7-nAChRs and to the Tyr-188 mutant receptor. In contrast, mutations of Tyr-195 in α7-nAChR led to decreased activation by nicotine without apparent effects on ACh- or Aβ-induced responses. Agonist-induced responses of Tyr-93 mutant α7-nAChRs indicated possible interactions of nicotine and Aβ with its hydroxyl group, but there was no change in presynaptic responses after mutation of Trp-149. All of the mutants were shown to be expressed on the plasma membrane using cell surface labeling.

Alzheimer disease (AD) 2The abbreviations used are: ADAlzheimer diseaseAββ amyloidnAChRnicotinic acetylcholine receptorAChacetylcholineHBSHEPES-buffered salineECDextracellular domainAchBPacetylcholine binding protein. is a neurodegenerative disease characterized by distinct pathologies. Over the course of the disease, there is loss of synapses and neuronal cells in select regions of the brain, particularly those critical for memory and cognitive processes. Histologically, AD pathology is evident in these regions as neuritic plaques, neurofibrillary tangles, and local inflammation. Neuritic plaques are primarily composed of fibrillar β-amyloid (Aβ), but the noted loss of synapses is best correlated with the level of soluble Aβ early in AD (1McLean C.A. Cherny R.A. Fraser F.W.

To date, the exact cellular targets in brain for Aβ are unknown.

Homomeric nicotinic α7 nAChRs appeared to display high-affinity binding to Aβ (16Wang H.Y. Lee D.H. Davis C.B. Shank R.P. J. Neurochem. 2000; 75: 1155-1161Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar, 17Wang H.Y. Lee D.H.S. D'Andrea M.R. Peterson P.A. Shank R.P. Reitz A.B. J. Biol.

Neurochem. 2007; 101: 1527-1538Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). α7-nAChRs are highly expressed on the presynaptic inputs in the hippocampus and cortex, which are critical regions for synaptic plasticity and memory formation. Specifically, α7-nAChRs located on hippocampal glutamatergic terminals regulate presynaptic glutamate release (19Sharma G. Vijayaraghavan S. Neuron. 2003; 38: 929-939Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar), and α7-nAChRs may facilitate long-term potentiation (20Kenney J.W. Gould T.J. Mol. Neurobiol. 2008; 38: 101-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). When applied to rodent hippocampal nerve terminals, pm to nm concentrations of Aβ induced increases in presynaptic calcium, which were largely dependent upon the presence of presynaptic nAChRs, as demonstrated in pharmacological studies and studies using receptor null mutants (21Dougherty J.J. Wu J. Nichols R.A. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 6740-6747Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 22Mehta T.K. Dougherty J.J. Wu J. Choi C.H. Khan G.M. Nichols R.A. J. Neurochem. 2009; 109: 1452-1458Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Picomolar Aβ was also shown to positively modulate synaptic plasticity in the hippocampus via presynaptic α7-nAChRs (7Puzzo D. Privitera L. Leznik E. Fà M. Staniszewski A. Palmeri A. Arancio O. J. Neurosci. 2008; 28: 14537-14545Crossref PubMed Scopus (584) Google Scholar), as measured by an increase in long-term potentiation. In contrast, Aβ blocked acetylcholine (ACh)-induced nicotinic postsynaptic currents when tested on α7-nAChRs in primary cultures of hippocampal neurons (13Liu Q. Kawai H. Berg D.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2001; 98: 4734-4739Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar) and hippocampal slices (14Pettit D.L. Shao Z. Yakel J.L. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: RC120Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting an inhibitory effect. Therefore, Aβ may play distinct regulatory roles depending on the location of the nAChRs. In particular, nAChRs at presynaptic sites possibly mediate an agonist-like effect of pm-nm Aβ. To demonstrate that the agonist-like action of Aβ involved direct activation of nAChRs, α7-nAChRs were expressed in the axonal varicosities of NG108-15 cells, which normally do not express functional nAChRs (23Khan G.M. Tong M. Jhun M. Arora K. Nichols R.A. Eur. J. Neurosci. 2010; 31: 788-796Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Aβ applied to NG108-15 varicosities expressing α7-nAChRs induced pronounced and sustained increases in Ca2+, reconstituting the agonist-like effect of Aβ in presynaptic-like structures, and the response could be fully blocked by the selective α7-nAChR antagonist α-bungarotoxin (23Khan G.M. Tong M. Jhun M. Arora K. Nichols R.A. Eur. J. Neurosci. 2010; 31: 788-796Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). To define the basis for Aβ activation of α7-nAChRs, this study examined candidate residues in the ligand binding domain of α7-nAChRs. Key aromatic residues for ligand binding, part of the so-called “aromatic cluster” in loops A, B, and C (24Brejc K. van Dijk W.J. Klaassen R.V. Schuurmans M. van der Oost J. Smit A.B. Sixma T.K.

Nature. 2001; 411 (255): 252-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), were investigated to assess whether they contribute to interactions with Aβ. The structural description of the mouse α7-nAChR ligand binding site was derived from that of the Torpedo nAChR (a muscle-type nAChR) and the ACh binding protein (24Brejc K. van Dijk W.J. Klaassen R.V. Schuurmans M. van der Oost J. Smit A.B. Sixma T.K. Nature. 2001; 411: 269-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (1586) Google Scholar). NG108-15 cells were cultured in DMEM containing 15% FBS and differentiated in 1% FBS-containing DMEM on exposure to dibutyryl cyclic AMP (1 mm, Sigma Aldrich) for 48 h until the presence of neurites and varicosities were observed (typically 2–3 days) as described (23Khan G.M. Tong M. Jhun M. Arora K. Nichols R.A. Eur. J. Neurosci. 2010; 31: 788-796Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Under these conditions, the neurites have a predominantly axonal character, and the varicosities display all of the necessary features of a presynaptic element (26Nelson P. Christian C. Nirenberg M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1976; 73: 123-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar, 27Rondé P. Dougherty J.J. Nichols R.A. J.

Nature. 1991; 349: 697-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). α7-nAChR was expressed in the NG108-15 cells by transfecting the mouse α7 cDNA (α7 cDNA or site-directed mutant α7 cDNA incorporated in pcDNA3.1zeo) with the FuGENE 6 transfection reagent (Roche). Mock cells were treated with FuGENE 6 alone. Successful expression of α7-nAChRs required another 48 h, and functional responses of α7-nAChRs in varicosities were monitored by confocal imaging (23Khan G.M. Tong M. Jhun M. Arora K. Nichols R.A. Eur. J. Neurosci. 2010; 31: 788-796Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Moderate expression levels were typically obtained, allowing for detection of negative or positive changes following receptor mutation. Changes in Ca2+ level in individual varicosities of differentiated NG108-15 cells were monitored by the specific Ca2+ fluorescent dye Fluo-4 as described previously (23Khan G.M. Tong M. Jhun M. Arora K. Nichols R.A. Eur. J. Neurosci. 2010; 31: 788-796Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). In brief, Fluo-4 was loaded into the cells cultured on Cell-Tak-coated coverslips as the acetoxymethylester derivative (Invitrogen). The cells were then perfused with oxygenated HEPES-buffered saline (HBS) (142 mm NaCl, 2.4 mm KCl, 1.2 mm K2PO4, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm CaCl2, 5 mm D-glucose, 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 100 nm tetrodotoxin; 1 μm atropine was included for ACh treatment), and were mounted into a rapid-exchange Warner perfusion chamber. Changes in fluorescence were visualized by a Zeiss LSM 5 Pascal confocal imaging system (excitation, 488 nm; emission, 515–565 nm band-pass; ×40/1.3 epifluorescence, oil-immersion Plan-Neofluar objective). Responses were recorded as a time course of 300 s, comprising 30 frames of confocal images with 10-s intervals. Aβ1–42, ACh, or nicotine was applied at the fifth frame by switching between HBS and HBS containing agonist via a six-channel perfusion valve control system (VC-66CS, Warner Instruments) with DN series constant flow. Four to ten varicosities were identified in captured images, and the fluorescent intensity associated with each varicosity was determined across all frames using ImageJ software. Fluorescence was converted to signal intensity and normalized to baseline (F/F0). Peak responses were F/F0 collected during 120–300 s after activation. For comparison to WT, increased peak (plateau) responses (F/F0-1) of mutant receptors were normalized to those of WT α7-nAChRs. The mouse α7-nAChR cDNA sequence was subcloned into the pcDNA3.1zeo plasmid vector (courtesy of Dr. Jerry Stitzel, University of Colorado). Tyrosines and tryptophans of interest were located, and mutations were made by changing original codons to desired codons using the QuikChange II XL site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) by PCR using the following primers: Y188F, 5′-cctggcaaaaggaatgagaagttctttgaatgctgcaaag-3′; Y188S, 5′-ggcaaaaggaatgagaagttcagtgaatgctgcaaagagccata-3′; Y195F, 5′-aatgctgcaaagagccattcccagatgtcaccta-3′; Y195S, 5′-gttctatgaatgctgcaaagagccaagcccagatgtcacc-3′; Y93F, 5′-aaccagacattctcctctttaacagtgcagatgaacg-3′; Y93S, 5′-gaaaccagacattctcctcagtaacagtgcagatgaacgc-3′; W149F, 5′-caaactgaagtttgggtccttctcctatggagggtgg-3′; and W149A, 5′-actgaagtttgggtccgcgtcctatggagggtgg-3′. The resultant mutant sequences were confirmed by DNA sequencing (GENEWIZ, Inc., New Brunswick, NJ; Genomics Core Facility at John A. Burns School of Medicine, University of Hawaii; Advanced Studies in Genomics, Proteomics, and Bioinformatics, University of Hawai'i at Manoa), comparing against the mouse α7 subunit nucleotide sequence (NCBI CCDS data base for Mus musculus Chrna7). Numbering of the mouse α7-nAChR amino acid sequence follows that of the processed, mature receptor (minus the 22-amino acid signal sequence). A chimeric receptor, α7V202-5HT3A, composed of the extracellular domain of the α7-nAChR subunit and the transmembrane and intracellular domains of the 5HT3A subunit, was constructed to distinguish the role of α7-nAChR extracellular domain. The procedure for construction of the plasmid containing the sequence for the chimeric receptor was adapted from a previously published protocol (32Grandori R. Struck K. Giovanielli K. Carey J. Protein Eng. 1997; 10: 1099-1100Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The N-terminal 224 amino acids of the mouse α7-nAChR (amino acids 1–224 of the proform, the last residue being Val-202 in the mature form) and the C-terminal 242 amino acids of the mouse 5HT3A receptor were amplified by PCR with overlapping ends. Two sets of primer pairs (forward and reverse) were used to amplify the extracellular domain sequence of α7-nAChR from its plasmid and the transmembrane and intracellular domain sequence of the 5HT3A subunit from its respective plasmid. A restriction site, XhoI, was built into the forward primer for the α7 ECD sequence (5′-taggctagcctcgagccggcggacggcgggaca-3′). The reverse primer for the α7 ECD sequence was composed of both the end of extracellular domain sequence of α7 nAChR and the beginning of first transmembrane domain sequence of the 5HT3A receptor (5′-taaaggcctccggcggatgatcactgtgtaggtgacatctgggt-3′). The forward primer for the 5HT3 sequence was simply the reverse complement of the reverse primer (5′-acccagatgtcacctacacagtgatcatccgccggaggccttta-3′). The final primer matched the end of the 5HT3A receptor sequence and had a XmaI restriction site built in (5′-aagcggccgcccgggtcaagaataatgccaaatgga-3′). After the first round of PCR, two pieces with overlapping ends were produced. Further amplification of these two overlapping fragments generated the open reading frame of α7V202-5HT3A, with two restriction sites in both ends, facilitating cloning of the α7V202-5HT3A sequence into a pCI mammalian expression vector. The resultant full chimeric receptor sequence was confirmed by DNA sequencing (Advanced Studies in Genomics, Proteomics, and Bioinformatics, University of Hawai'i at Manoa). Following transfection of differentiated NG108-15 cells, the expression level of the chimeric receptor was checked by both immunostaining and immunoblotting of biotinylated cell surface proteins. Immunostaining was used to visualize and compare the expression of wild-type and mutant α7-nAChRs in the varicosities of the differentiated NG108-15 cells following transfection of appropriate plasmids, as described previously (23Khan G.M. Tong M. Jhun M. Arora K. Nichols R.A. Eur. J. Neurosci. 2010; 31: 788-796Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Mock-treated cells were used as a background control. Forty-eight hours after transfection, cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in HBS, washed extensively with TBS, and then incubated with an anti-α7-nAChR antibody (1:200, Millipore). (The specificity of the anti-α7-nAChR antibody was confirmed by comparing immunoprecipitates from a wild-type and an α7-nAChR null mutant (knockout) mouse hippocampus via immunoblot analysis.) FITC-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (1:500, Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc.) was used as the secondary antibody. Stained cells were visualized by the Zeiss LSM 5 Pascal confocal imaging system. Labeling and isolation of surface proteins on the NG108-15 cells were performed following biotinylation using the Pierce Cell Surface Protein Isolation kit. The presence of surface wild-type and mutant α7-nAChRs in transfected cells, as compared with mock-treated cells, was assessed via immunoblot analysis using an anti-α7-nAChR antibody (1:2000; Millipore) as primary antibody and peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG as the secondary antibody (1:2500; Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc.). To control for protein loading on the blots, immunolabeling of the transferrin receptor, a ubiquitous cell surface protein, was performed using an anti-transferrin receptor antibody (Abcam, Inc.). Coimmunoprecipitation of α7-nAChRs with Aβ followed a previously published protocol (15Wang H.Y. Stucky A. Liu J. Shen C. Trocme-Thibierge C. Morain P. J. Neurosci. 2009; 29: 10961-10973Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) with the following modifications. NG108-15 cells at 80% confluence in 25 cm2 culture flasks were differentiated as described previously. Plasmids containing cDNA sequences for wild-type or Y188S α7-nAChRs were transfected into the differentiated cells. After 48 h, cells were incubated for 30 min with HBS (control) or 100 nm Aβ42 in HBS at 4 °C with constant shaking. All of the remaining steps were also performed at 4 °C. Cells were recovered from the flasks and pelleted by centrifugation at 1500 × g. Pellets were lysed in 250 μl of cell lysis buffer (25 mm HEPES, 200 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5% digitonin, 0.2% sodium cholate, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, HaltTM protease inhibitor mixture, 0.02% 2-mercaptoethanol) for 15 min on ice in a bath sonicator, followed by an additional 1-h incubation with continuous shaking on ice. The supernatant was collected following centrifugation of the insoluble fraction at 10,000 × g. The lysates were then incubated with protein G Dynabeads bound with anti-Aβ1–42 monoclonal antibodies, 6E10 (Covance) and BAM10 (Sigma), for 16 h. (Inclusion of both monoclonal antibodies was found to be essential.) The Dynabead immune complexes were isolated via a magnet (DynaMagTM-2), and the remaining lysate was kept for determination of the relative amount of protein by immunoblotting for GAPDH using an anti-GAPDH antibody (Abcam, Inc.). The Dynabead immune complexes were then washed three times with 200 μl of PBS and dissolved in 90 μl of SDS-PAGE sample buffer containing 5% 2-mercaptoethanol. After boiling for 5 min, samples were resolved on 4–20% Tris-HCl SDS gels and then transferred to nitrocellulose. The immunoblot analysis for wild-type and Y188S α7-nAChRs was performed as described in the previous section. The α7-nAChR was detected using a rabbit polyclonal anti-α7-nAChR antibody (1:2000, Millipore), and the 5-HT3A receptor was detected using rabbit polyclonal antibody Ab120 (1:2000, Ref. 33Spier A.D.

Brain Res. 1999; 67: 221-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), followed by peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (1:2500, Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc.) or IRDye® 680 goat anti-rabbit (1:5000, LI-COR Biosciences) as secondary antibody. Immunoreactive bands were detected by ECLtm detection (GE Healthcare) or Odyssey® Infrared Imaging (LI-COR Biosciences). Acetylcholine chloride, nicotine tartrate citrate, atropine chloride, digitonin, sodium cholate, and Nonidet P-40 were purchased from Sigma Aldrich. ACh was prepared as a stock solution at 10 mm, stored at −20°C, and diluted to 500 nm with oxygenated HBS before each experiment. 500 nm nicotine was freshly prepared by dissolving in oxygenated HBS before each experiment. Tetrodotoxin was from Calbiochem. The anti-α7-nAChR-specific antibody was purchased from Millipore, and the FITC- and peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit and anti-mouse antibodies were from Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc. The 6E10 anti-Aβ1–42 monoclonal antibody was from Covance, and the BAM-10 anti-Aβ1–42 monoclonal antibody was from Sigma. Anti-GAPDH and anti-transferrin receptor antibodies were from Abcam, Inc. IRDye® 680 goat anti-rabbit and IRDye® 800 goat anti-mouse antibodies were from LI-COR Biosciences. Fluo-4/AM, protein G Dynabeads, and DynaMagTM-2 were purchased from Invitrogen. The Pierce cell surface protein isolation kit and HaltTM protease inhibitor mixture were from Thermo Scientific. Aβ1–42 was purchased from BACHEM or American Peptide. A stock solution of Aβ1–42 was prepared at 0.1 mm by dissolving solid Aβ peptide in double deionized water as described previously (23Khan G.M. Tong M. Jhun M. Arora K. Nichols R.A. Eur. J. Neurosci. 2010; 31: 788-796Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Aβ1–42 for each experiment was diluted (from 1 pm to 100 nm) from the 0.1 mm stock into oxygenated HBS and vortexed to assure full suspension. Under these conditions, the Aβ is largely oligomeric, as assessed by SDS-PAGE and native gel analysis (23Khan G.M. Tong M. Jhun M. Arora K. Nichols R.A. Eur. J. Neurosci. 2010; 31: 788-796Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Although monomeric Aβ is also present (e.g. Refs. 34Bell K.A. O'Riordan K.J. Sweatt J.D. Dineley K.T. J.

Luheshi L.M. Söllvander S. Pereira de Barros T. Macao B. Knowles T.P. Biverstål H. Lendel C. Ekholm-Petterson F. Dubnovitsky A. Lannfelt L. Dobson C.M. Härd T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2010; 107: 15595-15600Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). The digitized images from confocal time series recordings were analyzed by Image J software. The signal intensity associated with an individual varicosity was expressed as F/F0 for each time point, where F0 is the signal intensity at time zero. Time series were all corrected for photobleaching (typically < 3%) and expressed as mean ± S.E. n represents the number of varicosities examined. Each experiment was replicated at least three times. Multiple groups were compared by one-way analysis of variance with Bonferroni multiple comparison post hoc test. Two-tailed Student's t tests were used for comparison of two groups. p < 0.05 was used as the minimal threshold for significance. The rodent hybrid neuroblastoma cell line NG108-15 was used as a model neuronal system for expression of nAChRs, as they are normally devoid of functional nAChRs. We recently demonstrated the functional expression of nAChRs in differentiated NG108-15 cells following transient transfection of the mouse sequence for α7-nAChR (23Khan G.M. Tong M. Jhun M. Arora K. Nichols R.A. Eur. J. Neurosci. 2010; 31: 788-796Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The axonal varicosities of the NG108-15 cells are presynaptic-like structures capable of synapsing on the appropriate postsynaptic target (26Nelson P. Christian C. Nirenberg M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1976; 73: 123-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar, 27Rondé P. Dougherty J.J. Nichols R.A. J. Physiol. 2000; 529: 307-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 28Rondé P. Nichols R.A. Neuroscience. 2001; 102: 979-987Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar), and thus expression of nAChRs in the varicosities serves as a reconstituted presynaptic system for examining the agonist-like action of Aβ. To begin to define the region(s) of the α7-nAChR with which Aβ interacts, we first asked whether the ECD is necessary and sufficient for activation of the receptor by Aβ. To do so, we constructed a chimeric receptor by fusing the nAChR ECD together with the transmembrane and intracellular domains of the 5-HT3 serotonin receptor (13Liu Q. Kawai H. Berg D.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2001; 98: 4734-4739Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar, 37Eiselé J.L. Bertrand S. Galzi J.L. Devillers-Thiéry A. Changeux J.P. Bertrand D.

Pharmacol. 2007; 152: 501-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), as the binding site in α7-nAChR for classical nicotinic agonists is located in the ECD, but Aβ may also influence α7-nAChR activity through an additional interaction with the plasma membrane (23Khan G.M. Tong M. Jhun M. Arora K. Nichols R.A. Eur. J. Neurosci. 2010; 31: 788-796Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), perhaps via lipid-interacting residues in the transmembrane domains (39Barrantes F.J. Brain Res. Rev. 2004; 47: 71-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Moreover, it was shown previously that the 5-HT3 receptor is unaffected by Aβ (13Liu Q. Kawai H. Berg D.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2001; 98: 4734-4739Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar, 16Wang H.Y. Lee D.H. Davis C.B. Shank R.P. J.

The chimeric receptor is denoted by α7V202-5HT3A, as valine (V) at position 202 of mouse α7-nAChR lies at the border between the extracellular and first transmembrane domain of the α7-nAChR (38Gee V.J. Kracun S. Cooper S.T. Gibb A.J. Millar N.S. Br. J. Pharmacol. 2007; 152: 501-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). This chimera was shown previously to be a fully functional ligand-gated ion channel, activated by nicotinic agonists instead of 5-HT3 agonists (37Eiselé J.L. Bertrand S. Galzi J.L.

https://openalex.org/W2054987357,"Pandemic influenza A(H1N1) (pH1N1) was first identified in North America in April 2009. Vaccination against pH1N1 commenced in the U.S. in October 2009 and continued through January 2010. The objective of this study was to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of pH1N1 vaccination.A computer simulation model was developed to predict costs and health outcomes for a pH1N1 vaccination program using inactivated vaccine compared to no vaccination. Probabilities, costs and quality-of-life weights were derived from emerging primary data on pH1N1 infections in the US, published and unpublished data for seasonal and pH1N1 illnesses, supplemented by expert opinion. The modeled target population included hypothetical cohorts of persons aged 6 months and older stratified by age and risk. The analysis used a one-year time horizon for most endpoints but also includes longer-term costs and consequences of long-term sequelae deaths. A societal perspective was used. Indirect effects (i.e., herd effects) were not included in the primary analysis. The main endpoint was the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio in dollars per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained. Sensitivity analyses were conducted.For vaccination initiated prior to the outbreak, pH1N1 vaccination was cost-saving for persons 6 months to 64 years under many assumptions. For those without high risk conditions, incremental cost-effectiveness ratios ranged from $8,000-$52,000/QALY depending on age and risk status. Results were sensitive to the number of vaccine doses needed, costs of vaccination, illness rates, and timing of vaccine delivery.Vaccination for pH1N1 for children and working-age adults is cost-effective compared to other preventive health interventions under a wide range of scenarios. The economic evidence was consistent with target recommendations that were in place for pH1N1 vaccination. We also found that the delays in vaccine availability had a substantial impact on the cost-effectiveness of vaccination."
https://openalex.org/W2065177537,"Background Carotid angioplasty and stenting (CAS) may currently be recommended especially in younger patients with a high-grade carotid artery stenosis. However, evidence is accumulating that in-stent restenosis (ISR) could be an important factor endangering the long-term efficacy of CAS. The aim of this study was to investigate the influence of inflammatory serum markers and procedure-related factors on ISR as diagnosed with duplex sonography. Methods We analyzed 210 CAS procedures in 194 patients which were done at a single university hospital between May 2003 and June 2010. Periprocedural C-reactive protein (CRP) and leukocyte count as well as stent design and geometry, and other periprocedural factors were analyzed with respect to the occurrence of an ISR as diagnosed with serial carotid duplex ultrasound investigations during clinical long-term follow-up. Results Over a median of 33.4 months follow-up (IQR: 14.9–53.7) of 210 procedures (mean age of 67.9±9.7 years, 71.9% male, 71.0% symptomatic) an ISR of ≥70% was detected in 5.7% after a median of 8.6 months (IQR: 3.4–17.3). After multiple regression analysis, leukocyte count after CAS-intervention (odds ratio (OR): 1.31, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.02–1.69; p = 0.036), as well as stent length and width were associated with the development of an ISR during follow-up (OR: 1.25, 95% CI: 1.05–1.65, p = 0.022 and OR: 0.28, 95% CI: 0.09–0.84, p = 0.010). Conclusions The majority of ISR during long-term follow-up after CAS occur within the first year. ISR is associated with periinterventional inflammation markers and influenced by certain stent characteristics such as stent length and width. Our findings support the assumption that stent geometry leading to vessel injury as well as periprocedural inflammation during CAS plays a pivotal role in the development of carotid artery ISR."
https://openalex.org/W2031951806,"Beyond providing cues about an agent's intention, communicative actions convey information about the presence of a second agent towards whom the action is directed (second-agent information). In two psychophysical studies we investigated whether the perceptual system makes use of this information to infer the presence of a second agent when dealing with impoverished and/or noisy sensory input.Participants observed point-light displays of two agents (A and B) performing separate actions. In the Communicative condition, agent B's action was performed in response to a communicative gesture by agent A. In the Individual condition, agent A's communicative action was replaced with a non-communicative action. Participants performed a simultaneous masking yes-no task, in which they were asked to detect the presence of agent B. In Experiment 1, we investigated whether criterion c was lowered in the Communicative condition compared to the Individual condition, thus reflecting a variation in perceptual expectations. In Experiment 2, we manipulated the congruence between A's communicative gesture and B's response, to ascertain whether the lowering of c in the Communicative condition reflected a truly perceptual effect. Results demonstrate that information extracted from communicative gestures influences the concurrent processing of biological motion by prompting perception of a second agent (second-agent effect).We propose that this finding is best explained within a Bayesian framework, which gives a powerful rationale for the pervasive role of prior expectations in visual perception."
https://openalex.org/W2025623552,"The diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in the early stage is crucial to the application of curative treatments which are the only hope for increasing the life expectancy of patients. Recently, several large-scale studies have shed light on this problem through analysis of gene expression profiles to identify markers correlated with HCC progression. However, those marker sets shared few genes in common and were poorly validated using independent data. Therefore, we developed a systems biology based classifier by combining the differential gene expression with topological features of human protein interaction networks to enhance the ability of HCC diagnosis.In the Oncomine platform, genes differentially expressed in HCC tissues relative to their corresponding normal tissues were filtered by a corrected Q value cut-off and Concept filters. The identified genes that are common to different microarray datasets were chosen as the candidate markers. Then, their networks were analyzed by GeneGO Meta-Core software and the hub genes were chosen. After that, an HCC diagnostic classifier was constructed by Partial Least Squares modeling based on the microarray gene expression data of the hub genes. Validations of diagnostic performance showed that this classifier had high predictive accuracy (85.88∼92.71%) and area under ROC curve (approximating 1.0), and that the network topological features integrated into this classifier contribute greatly to improving the predictive performance. Furthermore, it has been demonstrated that this modeling strategy is not only applicable to HCC, but also to other cancers.Our analysis suggests that the systems biology-based classifier that combines the differential gene expression and topological features of human protein interaction network may enhance the diagnostic performance of HCC classifier."
https://openalex.org/W2103733878,"Brain synthesis of steroids including sex-steroids is attracting much attention. The endogenous synthesis of corticosteroids in the hippocampus, however, has been doubted because of the inability to detect deoxycorticosterone (DOC) synthase, cytochrome P450(c21).The expression of P450(c21) was demonstrated using mRNA analysis and immmunogold electron microscopic analysis in the adult male rat hippocampus. DOC production from progesterone (PROG) was demonstrated by metabolism analysis of (3)H-steroids. All the enzymes required for corticosteroid synthesis including P450(c21), P450(2D4), P450(11β1) and 3β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (3β-HSD) were localized in the hippocampal principal neurons as shown via in situ hybridization and immunoelectron microscopic analysis. Accurate corticosteroid concentrations in rat hippocampus were determined by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. In adrenalectomized rats, net hippocampus-synthesized corticosterone (CORT) and DOC were determined to 6.9 and 5.8 nM, respectively. Enhanced spinogenesis was observed in the hippocampus following application of low nanomolar (10 nM) doses of CORT for 1 h.These results imply the complete pathway of corticosteroid synthesis of 'pregnenolone →PROG→DOC→CORT' in the hippocampal neurons. Both P450(c21) and P450(2D4) can catalyze conversion of PROG to DOC. The low nanomolar level of CORT synthesized in hippocampal neurons may play a role in modulation of synaptic plasticity, in contrast to the stress effects by micromolar CORT from adrenal glands."
https://openalex.org/W2064733698,"Campylobacter concisus is an emerging pathogen of the human gastrointestinal tract. Its role in different diseases remains a subject of debate; this may be due to strain to strain genetic variation. Here, we sequence and analyze the genome of a C. concisus from a biopsy of a child with Crohn's disease (UNSWCD); the second such genome for this species. A 1.8 Mb genome was assembled with paired-end reads from a next-generation sequencer. This genome is smaller than the 2.1 Mb C. concisus reference BAA-1457. While 1593 genes were conserved across UNSWCD and BAA-1457, 138 genes from UNSWCD and 281 from BAA-1457 were unique when compared against the other. To further validate the genome assembly and annotation, comprehensive shotgun proteomics was performed. This confirmed 78% of open reading frames in UNSWCD and, importantly, provided evidence of expression for 217 proteins previously defined as ‘hypothetical’ in Campylobacter. Substantial functional differences were observed between the UNSWCD and the reference strain. Enrichment analysis revealed differences in membrane proteins, response to stimulus, molecular transport and electron carriers. Synteny maps for the 281 genes not present in UNSWCD identified seven functionally associated gene clusters. These included one associated with the CRISPR family and another which encoded multiple restriction endonucleases; these genes are all involved in resistance to phage attack. Many of the observed differences are consistent with UNSWCD having adapted to greater surface interaction with host cells, as opposed to BAA-1457 which may prefer a free-living environment."
https://openalex.org/W2163554848,"The glucocorticoid receptor (GR) is a member of the nuclear hormone receptor superfamily of ligand-activated transcription factors. In contrast to many other nuclear receptors, GR is thought to be exclusively cytoplasmic in quiescent cells, and only translocate to the nucleus on ligand binding. We now demonstrate significant nuclear GR in the absence of ligand, which requires nuclear localisation signal 1 (NLS1). Live cell imaging reveals dramatic GR import into the nucleus through interphase and rapid exclusion of the GR from the nucleus at the onset of mitosis, which persists into early G1. This suggests that the heterogeneity in GR distribution is reflective of cell cycle phase. The impact of cell cycle–driven GR trafficking on a panel of glucocorticoid actions was profiled. In G2/M-enriched cells there was marked prolongation of glucocorticoid-induced ERK activation. This was accompanied by DNA template-specific, ligand-independent GR transactivation. Using chimeric and domain-deleted receptors we demonstrate that this transactivation effect is mediated by the AF1 transactivation domain. AF-1 harbours multiple phosphorylation sites, which are consensus sequences for kinases including CDKs, whose activity changes during the cell cycle. In G2/M there was clear ligand independent induction of GR phosphorylation on residues 203 and 211, both of which are phosphorylated after ligand activation. Ligand-independent transactivation required induction of phospho-S211GR but not S203GR, thereby directly linking cell cycle driven GR modification with altered GR function. Cell cycle phase therefore regulates GR localisation and post-translational modification which selectively impacts GR activity. This suggests that cell cycle phase is an important determinant in the cellular response to Gc, and that mitotic index contributes to tissue Gc sensitivity."

In biochemical assays, caspase-2 uniquely prefers a pentapeptide (such as VDVAD) rather than a tetrapeptide, as required for efficient cleavage by other caspases. We investigated the molecular basis for pentapeptide specificity using peptide analog inhibitors and substrates that vary at the P5 position. We determined the crystal structures of apo caspase-2, caspase-2 in complex with peptide inhibitors VDVAD-CHO, ADVAD-CHO, and DVAD-CHO, and a T380A mutant of caspase-2 in complex with VDVAD-CHO. Two residues, Thr-380 and Tyr-420, are identified to be critical for the P5 residue recognition; mutation of the two residues reduces the catalytic efficiency by about 4- and 40-fold, respectively. The structures also provide a series of snapshots of caspase-2 in different catalytic states, shedding light on the mechanism of capase-2 activation, substrate binding, and catalysis. By comparing the apo and inhibited caspase-2 structures, we propose that the disruption of a non-conserved salt bridge between Glu-217 and the invariant Arg-378 is important for the activation of caspase-2.

https://openalex.org/W2077770822,"Protein structure prediction methods such as Rosetta search for the lowest energy conformation of the polypeptide chain. However, the experimentally observed native state is at a minimum of the free energy, rather than the energy. The neglect of the missing configurational entropy contribution to the free energy can be partially justified by the assumption that the entropies of alternative folded states, while very much less than unfolded states, are not too different from one another, and hence can be to a first approximation neglected when searching for the lowest free energy state. The shortcomings of current structure prediction methods may be due in part to the breakdown of this assumption. Particularly problematic are proteins with significant disordered regions which do not populate single low energy conformations even in the native state. We describe two approaches within the Rosetta structure modeling methodology for treating such regions. The first does not require advance knowledge of the regions likely to be disordered; instead these are identified by minimizing a simple free energy function used previously to model protein folding landscapes and transition states. In this model, residues can be either completely ordered or completely disordered; they are considered disordered if the gain in entropy outweighs the loss of favorable energetic interactions with the rest of the protein chain. The second approach requires identification in advance of the disordered regions either from sequence alone using for example the DISOPRED server or from experimental data such as NMR chemical shifts. During Rosetta structure prediction calculations the disordered regions make only unfavorable repulsive contributions to the total energy. We find that the second approach has greater practical utility and illustrate this with examples from de novo structure prediction, NMR structure calculation, and comparative modeling."

Sucrose gradient fractionation demonstrated that these forms of MT4-MMP are all present in lipid rafts. Mutational and computational analyses revealed that Cys564, which is present within the stem region, mediates MT4-MMP homodimerization by forming a disulfide bond. Substitution of Cys564 results in a more rapid MT4-MMP turnover, when compared with the wild-type enzyme, consistent with a role for dimerization in protein stability. Expression of MT4-MMP in Madin-Darby canine kidney cells enhanced cell migration and invasion of Matrigel, a process that requires catalytic activity.

Taken together, the data presented here provide a new insight into the characteristics of MT4-MMP and highlight the common and distinct properties of the glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored membrane type-matrix metalloproteinases."
https://openalex.org/W1985761813,"As cynobacterial blooms frequently occur in fresh waters throughout the world, microcystins (MCs) have caused serious damage to both wildlife and human health. MCs are known to have developmental toxicity, however, the possible molecular mechanism is largely unknown. This is the first toxicological study to integrate post-transcriptomic, proteomic and bioinformatics analysis to explore molecular mechanisms for developmental toxicity of MCs in zebrafish. After being microinjected directly into embryos, MC-RR dose-dependently decreased survival rates and increased malformation rates of embryos, causing various embryo abnormalities including loss of vascular integrity and hemorrhage. Expressions of 31 microRNAs (miRNAs) and 78 proteins were significantly affected at 72 hours post-fertilisation (hpf). Expressions of miR-430 and miR-125 families were also significantly changed. The altered expressions of miR-31 and miR-126 were likely responsible for the loss of vascular integrity. MC-RR significantly reduced the expressions of a number of proteins involved in energy metabolism, cell division, protein synthesis, cytoskeleton maintenance, response to stress and DNA replication. Bioinformatics analysis shows that several aberrantly expressed miRNAs and proteins (involved in various molecular pathways) were predicted to be potential MC-responsive miRNA-target pairs, and that their aberrant expressions should be the possible molecular mechanisms for the various developmental defects caused by MC-RR."

Loop>J sequences are highly conserved, suggesting that loop>J plays a crucial role in the catalytic activity of all ARF GEFs. Using GEF mutants unable to bind ARF, we showed that GEFs associate with membranes independently of ARF and catalyze ARF activation in vivo only when membrane-associated.

https://openalex.org/W2118282625,"N-terminal tails of H2A, H2B, H3 and H4 histone families are subjected to posttranslational modifications that take part in transcriptional regulation mechanisms, such as transcription factor binding and gene expression. Regulation mechanisms under control of histone modification are important but remain largely unclear, despite of emerging datasets for comprehensive analysis of histone modification. In this paper, we focus on what we call genetic harmonious units (GHUs), which are co-occurring patterns among transcription factor binding, gene expression and histone modification. We present the first genome-wide approach that captures GHUs by combining ChIP-chip with microarray datasets from Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Our approach employs noise-robust soft clustering to select patterns which share the same preferences in transcription factor-binding, histone modification and gene expression, which are all currently implied to be closely correlated. The detected patterns are a well-studied acetylation of lysine 16 of H4 in glucose depletion as well as co-acetylation of five lysine residues of H3 with H4 Lys12 and H2A Lys7 responsible for ribosome biogenesis. Furthermore, our method further suggested the recognition of acetylated H4 Lys16 being crucial to histone acetyltransferase ESA1, whose essential role is still under controversy, from a microarray dataset on ESA1 and its bypass suppressor mutants. These results demonstrate that our approach allows us to provide clearer principles behind gene regulation mechanisms under histone modifications and detect GHUs further by applying to other microarray and ChIP-chip datasets. The source code of our method, which was implemented in MATLAB (http://www.mathworks.com/), is available from the supporting page for this paper: http://www.bic.kyoto-u.ac.jp/pathway/natsume/hm_detector.htm."

https://openalex.org/W2171065986,"Helicases are motor proteins that play a central role in the metabolism of DNA and RNA in biological cells. Using the energy of ATP molecules, they are able to translocate along the nucleic acids and unwind their duplex structure. They have been extensively characterized in the past and grouped into superfamilies based on structural similarities and sequential motifs. However, their functional aspects and the mechanism of their operation are not yet well understood. Here, we consider three helicases from the major superfamily 2 - Hef, Hel308 and XPD - and study their conformational dynamics by using coarse-grained relaxational elastic network models. Specifically, their responses to mechanical perturbations are analyzed. This enables us to identify robust and ordered conformational motions which may underlie the functional activity of these proteins. As we show, such motions are well-organized and have large amplitudes. Their possible roles in the processing of nucleic substrate are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W2026439748,"The hepatic nuclear factor HNF4α is a versatile transcription factor and controls expression of many genes in development, metabolism and disease. To delineate its regulatory gene network in colon cancer and to define novel gene targets a comprehensive genome-wide scan was carried out at a resolution of 35 bp with chromatin IP DNA obtained from the human colon carcinoma cell line Caco-2 that is a particularly rich source of HNF4α. More than 90% of HNF4α binding sites were mapped as promoter distal sequences while enhancer elements could be defined to foster chromatin loops for interaction with other promoter-bound transcription factors. Sequence motif analysis by various genetic algorithms evidenced a unique enhanceosome that consisted of the nuclear proteins ERα, AP1, GATA and HNF1α as cooperating transcription factors. Overall >17,500 DNA binding sites were identified with a gene/binding site ratio that differed >6-fold between chromosomes and clustered in distinct chromosomal regions amongst >6600 genes targeted by HNF4α. Evidence is presented for nuclear receptor cross-talk of HNF4α and estrogen receptor α that is recapitulated at the sequence level. Remarkably, the Y-chromosome is devoid of HNF4α binding sites. The functional importance of enrichment sites was confirmed in genome-wide gene expression studies at varying HNF4α protein levels. Taken collectively, a genome-wide scan of HNF4α binding sites is reported to better understand basic mechanisms of transcriptional control of HNF4α targeted genes. Novel promoter distal binding sites are identified which form an enhanceosome thereby facilitating RNA processing events."

We suspect a combination of biological and analytic factors confounds interpretation of glioblastoma expression data. We seek to clarify the nature and relative contributions of these factors, to focus additional investigations, and to improve the accuracy and consistency of translational glioblastoma analyses.We analyzed gene expression and clinical data for 340 glioblastomas in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). We developed a logic model to analyze potential sources of biological, technical, and analytic variability and used standard linear classifiers and linear dimensional reduction algorithms to investigate the nature and relative contributions of each factor.Commonly-described sources of classification error, including individual sample characteristics, batch effects, and analytic and technical noise make measurable but proportionally minor contributions to inconsistent molecular classification. Our analysis suggests that three, previously underappreciated factors may account for a larger fraction of classification errors: inherent non-linear/non-orthogonal relationships among the genes used in conjunction with classification algorithms that assume linearity; skewed data distributions assumed to be Gaussian; and biologic variability (noise) among tumors, of which we propose three types.Our analysis of the TCGA data demonstrates a contributory role for technical factors in molecular classification inconsistencies in glioblastoma but also suggests that biological variability, abnormal data distribution, and non-linear relationships among genes may be responsible for a proportionally larger component of classification error. These findings may have important implications for both glioblastoma research and for translational application of other large-volume biological databases."
https://openalex.org/W1967355638,"Vertebrate embryos display a predominant head-to-tail body axis whose formation is associated with the progressive development of post-cranial structures from a pool of caudal undifferentiated cells. This involves the maintenance of active FGF signaling in this caudal region as a consequence of the restricted production of the secreted factor FGF8. FGF8 is transcribed specifically in the caudal precursor region and is down-regulated as cells differentiate and the embryo extends caudally. We are interested in understanding the progressive down-regulation of FGF8 and its coordination with the caudal movement of cells which is also known to be FGF-signaling dependent. Our study is performed using mathematical modeling and computer simulations. We use an individual-based hybrid model as well as a caricature continuous model for the simulation of experimental observations (ours and those known from the literature) in order to examine possible mechanisms that drive differentiation and cell movement during the axis elongation. Using these models we have identified a possible gene regulatory network involving self-repression of a caudal morphogen coupled to directional domain movement that may account for progressive down-regulation of FGF8 and conservation of the FGF8 domain of expression. Furthermore, we have shown that chemotaxis driven by molecules, such as FGF8 secreted in the stem zone, could underlie the migration of the caudal precursor zone and, therefore, embryonic axis extension. These mechanisms may also be at play in other developmental processes displaying a similar mode of axis extension coupled to cell differentiation."
https://openalex.org/W2012874373,"Pitcher plant bogs, or carnivorous plant wetlands, have experienced extensive habitat loss and fragmentation throughout the southeastern United States Coastal Plain, resulting in an estimated reduction to <3% of their former range. This situation has lead to increased management attention of these habitats and their carnivorous plant species. However, conservation priorities focus primarily on the plants since little information currently exists on other community members, such as their endemic arthropod biota. Here, we investigated the population structure of one of these, the obligate pitcher plant moth Exyra semicrocea (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae), using mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI) gene sequences. Examination of 221 individuals from 11 populations across eight southeastern US states identified 51 unique haplotypes. These haplotypes belonged to one of two divergent (∼1.9–3.0%) lineages separated by the Mississippi alluvial plain. Populations of the West Gulf Coastal Plain exhibited significant genetic structure, contrasting with similarly distanced populations east of the Mississippi alluvial plain. In the eastern portion of the Coastal Plain, an apparent transition zone exists between two regionally distinct population groups, with a well-established genetic discontinuity for other organisms coinciding with this zone. The structure of E. semicrocea appears to have been influenced by patchy pitcher plant bog habitats in the West Gulf Coastal Plain as well as impacts of Pleistocene interglacials on the Apalachicola-Chattahoochee-Flint River Basin. These findings, along with potential extirpation of E. semicrocea at four visited, but isolated, sites highlight the need to consider other endemic or associated community members when managing and restoring pitcher plant bog habitats."
https://openalex.org/W2059321412,"Indicators of temperament appear early in infancy and remain relatively stable over time. Despite a great deal of interest in biological indices of temperament, most studies of infant temperament rely on parental reports or behavioral tasks. Thus, the extent to which commonly used temperament measures relate to potential biological indicators of infant temperament is still relatively unknown. The current experiment examines the relationship between a common parental report measure of temperament--the Infant Behavior Questionnaire-Revised (IBQ-R)--and measures of frontal EEG asymmetry in infants. We examined associations between the subscales of the IBQ-R and frontal EEG asymmetry scores recorded during a combined series of neutral attentional and putatively emotional recording conditions in infants between 7 and 9 months of age. We predicted that approach-related subscales of the IBQ-R (e.g., Approach, Soothability) would be related to greater left prefrontal asymmetry, while withdrawal-related subscales (e.g., Distress to Limitations, Fear, Falling Reactivity, Perceptual Sensitivity) would be related to greater right prefrontal asymmetry. In the mid- and lateral-frontal regions, Approach, Distress to Limitations, Fear, Soothability, and Perceptual Sensitivity were generally associated with greater left frontal activation (rs≥.23, ps<0.05), while only Falling Reactivity was associated with greater right frontal activation (rs≤-.44, ps<0.05). Results suggest that variability in frontal EEG asymmetry is robustly associated with parental report measures of temperament in infancy."
https://openalex.org/W2084057728,"Background Socioeconomic, demographic, and geographic factors are known determinants of stroke and myocardial infarction (MI) risk. Clustering of these factors in neighborhoods needs to be taken into consideration during planning, prioritization and implementation of health programs intended to reduce disparities. Given the complex and multidimensional nature of these factors, multivariate methods are needed to identify neighborhood clusters of these determinants so as to better understand the unique neighborhood profiles. This information is critical for evidence-based health planning and service provision. Therefore, this study used a robust multivariate approach to classify neighborhoods and identify their socio-demographic characteristics so as to provide information for evidence-based neighborhood health planning for stroke and MI. Methods and Findings The study was performed in East Tennessee Appalachia, an area with one of the highest stroke and MI risks in USA. Robust principal component analysis was performed on neighborhood (census tract) socioeconomic and demographic characteristics, obtained from the US Census, to reduce the dimensionality and influence of outliers in the data. Fuzzy cluster analysis was used to classify neighborhoods into Peer Neighborhoods (PNs) based on their socioeconomic and demographic characteristics. Nearest neighbor discriminant analysis and decision trees were used to validate PNs and determine the characteristics important for discrimination. Stroke and MI mortality risks were compared across PNs. Four distinct PNs were identified and their unique characteristics and potential health needs described. The highest risk of stroke and MI mortality tended to occur in less affluent PNs located in urban areas, while the suburban most affluent PNs had the lowest risk. Conclusions Implementation of this multivariate strategy provides health planners useful information to better understand and effectively plan for the unique neighborhood health needs and is important in guiding resource allocation, service provision, and policy decisions to address neighborhood health disparities and improve population health."
https://openalex.org/W2104311944,"Transcriptome analysis of bovine mammary development has provided insight into regulation of mammogenesis. However, previous studies primarily examined expression of epithelial and stromal tissues combined, and consequently did not account for tissue specific contribution to mammary development. Our objective was to identify differences in gene expression in epithelial and intralobular stromal compartments. Tissue was biopsied from non-lactating dairy cows 3 weeks prepartum, cut into explants and incubated for 2 hr with insulin and hydrocortisone. Epithelial and intralobular stromal tissues were isolated with laser capture microdissection. Global gene expression was measured with Bovine Affymetrix GeneChips, and data were preprocessed using RMA method. Moderated t-tests from gene-specific linear model analysis with cell type as a fixed effect showed more than 3,000 genes were differentially expressed between tissues (P<0.05; FDR<0.17). Analysis of epithelial and stromal transcriptomes using Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery (DAVID) and Ingenuity Pathways Analysis (IPA) showed that epithelial and stromal cells contributed distinct molecular signatures. Epithelial signatures were enriched with gene sets for protein synthesis, metabolism and secretion. Stromal signatures were enriched with genes that encoded molecules important to signaling, extracellular matrix composition and remodeling. Transcriptome differences also showed evidence for paracrine interactions between tissues in stimulation of IGF1 signaling pathway, stromal reaction, angiogenesis, neurogenesis, and immune response. Molecular signatures point to the dynamic role the stroma plays in prepartum mammogenesis and highlight the importance of examining the roles of cell types within the mammary gland when targeting therapies and studying mechanisms that affect milk production."
https://openalex.org/W2031742960,"Alzheimer disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by progressive decline of cognitive function that represents one of the most dramatic medical challenges for the aging population. Aβ peptides, generated by processing of the Amyloid Precursor Protein (APP), are thought to play a central role in the pathogenesis of AD. However, the network of physical and functional interactions that may affect their production and deposition is still poorly understood. The use of a bioinformatic approach based on human/mouse conserved coexpression allowed us to identify a group of genes that display an expression profile strongly correlated with APP. Among the most prominent candidates, we investigated whether the collagen chaperone HSP47 could be functionally correlated with APP. We found that HSP47 accumulates in amyloid deposits of two different mouse models and of some AD patients, is capable to physically interact with APP and can be relocalized by APP overexpression. Notably, we found that it is possible to reduce the levels of secreted Aβ peptides by reducing the expression of HSP47 or by interfering with its activity via chemical inhibitors. Our data unveil HSP47 as a new functional interactor of APP and imply it as a potential target for preventing the formation and/or growth amyloid plaques."

Gö6976 progressively increased the Michaelis-Menten constant and decreased the Hill coefficient without reducing the maximal velocity of GC-A and GC-B. In the presence of 1 mm ATP, the K(i) was 1 μm for both enzymes. Inhibition of GC-B was minimal in the absence of ATP, and 1 mm ATP increased the inhibition 4-fold. In a reciprocal manner, 10 μm Gö6976 increased the potency of ATP for GC-B 4-fold. In contrast to a recent study (Duda, T., Yadav, P., and Sharma, R. K. (2010) FEBS J. 277, 2550-2553), neither staurosporine nor Gö6976 activated GC-A or GC-B. This is the first study to show that Gö6976 reduces GTP binding and the first demonstration of a competitive inhibitor of a receptor guanylyl cyclase. We conclude that Gö6976 reduces GTP binding to the catalytic site of GC-A and GC-B and that ATP increases the magnitude of the inhibition."
https://openalex.org/W1965560791,"Background Activator protein-1 (AP-1) is a mediator of BMP or FGF signaling during Xenopus embryogenesis. However, specific role of AP-1 in activin signaling has not been elucidated during vertebrate development. Methodology/Principal Findings We provide new evidence showing that overexpression of heterodimeric AP-1 comprised of c-jun and c-fos (AP-1c-Jun/c-Fos) induces the expression of BMP-antagonizing organizer genes (noggin, chordin and goosecoid) that were normally expressed by high dose of activin. AP-1c-Jun/c-Fos enhanced the promoter activities of organizer genes but reduced that of PV.1, a BMP4-response gene. A loss of function study clearly demonstrated that AP-1c-Jun/c-Fos is required for the activin-induced organizer and neural gene expression. Moreover, physical interaction of AP-1c-Jun/c-Fos and Smad3 cooperatively enhanced the transcriptional activity of goosecoid via direct binding on this promoter. Interestingly, Smad3 mutants at c-Jun binding site failed in regulation of organizer genes, indicating that these physical interactions are specifically necessary for the expression of organizer genes. Conclusions/Significance AP-1c-Jun/c-Fos plays a specific role in organizer gene expression in downstream of activin signal during early Xenopus embryogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2154487972,"Telomeric heterochromatin assembly in budding yeast propagates through the association of Silent Information Regulator (SIR) proteins with nucleosomes, and the nucleosome array has been assumed to fold into a compacted structure. It is believed that the level of compaction and gene repression within heterochromatic regions can be modulated by histone modifications, such as acetylation of H3 lysine 56 and H4 lysine 16, and monoubiquitylation of H2B lysine 123. However, it remains unclear as to whether or not gene silencing is a direct consequence of the compaction of chromatin. Here, by investigating the role of the carboxy-terminus of histone H2B in heterochromatin formation, we identify that the disorderly compaction of chromatin induced by a mutation at H2B T122 specifically hinders telomeric heterochromatin formation. H2B T122 is positioned within the highly conserved AVTKY motif of the αC helix of H2B. Heterochromatin containing the T122E substitution in H2B remains inaccessible to ectopic dam methylase with dramatically increased mobility in sucrose gradients, indicating a compacted chromatin structure. Genetic studies indicate that this unique phenotype is independent of H2B K123 ubiquitylation and Sir4. In addition, using ChIP analysis, we demonstrate that telomere structure in the mutant is further disrupted by a defect in Sir2/Sir3 binding and the resulting invasion of euchromatic histone marks. Thus, we have revealed that the compaction of chromatin per se is not sufficient for heterochromatin formation. Instead, these results suggest that an appropriately arrayed chromatin mediated by H2B C-terminus is required for SIR binding and the subsequent formation of telomeric chromatin in yeast, thereby identifying an intrinsic property of the nucleosome that is required for the establishment of telomeric heterochromatin. This requirement is also likely to exist in higher eukaryotes, as the AVTKY motif of H2B is evolutionarily conserved."

This family has been cloned and characterized predominantly from mammals and amphibians. Avian species ingest stone and grit to help digest food, which may expose their gut to severe physical conditions. To further the understanding of the function of the TFF gene family across species, we undertook this research to clone, sequence, and characterize the spatio-temporal expression patterns of chicken TFF2 (ChTFF2) cDNA. Bioinformatics analysis of the promoter region and deduced amino acid sequence demonstrated that ChTFF2 contained unique characteristics; specifically the chicken promoter has multiple start sites and the protein contains a series of Lys-Lys-Val repeats. Unlike mammals, where TFF2 is detected primarily in the stomach, and occasionally in the proximal duodenum, chicken TFF2 transcripts are found throughout the gastrointestinal tract, with major expression sites in the glandular and muscular stomach as well as evident expression in the colon, small intestine, cecal tonsil and crop. Temporal analysis of intestinal ChTFF2 transcripts by quantitative RT-PCR showed high levels in embryos and a trend of constant expression during embryonic and post-hatch development, with a reduction occurring around hatch. Phylogenetic analysis highlighted the conservation of TFF proteins and functional divergence of trefoil domains, which suggest a transitional role in the bird during evolution."
https://openalex.org/W1967488636,"The β-adrenoceptors (β-ARs) control many cellular processes. Here, we show that β-ARs inhibit calcium depletion-induced cell contractility and subsequent cell detachment of L6 skeletal muscle cells. The mechanism underlying the cell detachment inhibition was studied by using a quantitative cell detachment assay. We demonstrate that cell detachment induced by depletion of extracellular calcium is due to myosin- and ROCK-dependent contractility. The β-AR inhibition of L6 skeletal muscle cell detachment was shown to be mediated by the β2-AR and increased cAMP but was surprisingly not dependent on the classical downstream effectors PKA or Epac, nor was it dependent on PKG, PI3K or PKC. However, inhibition of potassium channels blocks the β2-AR mediated effects. Furthermore, activation of potassium channels fully mimicked the results of β2-AR activation. In conclusion, we present a novel finding that β2-AR signaling inhibits contractility and thus cell detachment in L6 skeletal muscle cells by a cAMP and potassium channel dependent mechanism."
https://openalex.org/W2027919929,"NFκB is an inducible transcriptional factor controlled by two principal signaling cascades and plays pivotal roles in diverse physiological processes including inflammation, apoptosis, oncogenesis, immunity, and development. Activation of NFκB signaling was detected in skin of SHAPRIN-deficient mice and can be diminished by an NFκB inhibitor. However, in vitro studies demonstrated that SHARPIN activates NFκB signaling by forming a linear ubiquitin chain assembly complex with RNF31 (HOIP) and RBCK1 (HOIL1). The inconsistency between in vivo and in vitro findings about SHARPIN's function on NFκB activation could be partially due to SHARPIN's potential interactions with downstream molecules of NFκB pathway. In this study, 17 anti-flag immunoprecipitated proteins, including TRAF2, were identified by mass spectrum analysis among Sharpin-Flag transfected mouse fibroblasts, B lymphocytes, and BALB/c LN stroma 12 cells suggesting their interaction with SHARPIN. Interaction between SHARPIN and TRAF2 confirmed previous yeast two hybridization reports that SHARPIN was one TRAF2's partners. Furthermore, luciferase-based NFκB reporter assays demonstrated that SHARPIN negatively associates with NFκB activation, which can be partly compensated by over-expression of TRAF2. These data suggested that other than activating NFκB signaling by forming ubiquitin ligase complex with RNF31 and RBCK1, SHARPIN may also negatively associate with NFκB activation via interactions with other NFκB members, such as TRAF2."
