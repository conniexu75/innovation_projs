Storage in the form of intermetallic hydrides can be safe and, where hydrogen has some special value as a fuel, economical. New pumps and refrigerators based on the heat of sorption of the hydrogen into the intermetallic are approaching commercial viability."

(2) In this experiment B.coli did not show variation or mutation when it was treated with X-rays. (3) With increasing irradiation Erythrobacillus prodigiosus showed a tendency toward lack of ability to produce its characteristic red pigment. By allowing the organism to grow on the plate for a period of five days the greater portion of the colonies produced their pigment. If a transfer of a white colony is made to an agar slant the characteristic pigment is produced in twelve hours. In only one case was it necessary to make a second transfer in order to bring about the development of the pigment. The above is another example of the variation tendency of Erythrobacillus prodigiosus."

https://openalex.org/W2045349087,"A comparison of salary scales of trained men shows rather clearly at the present time that (1) The pay scale of endowed and state universities and agricultural colleges is approximately like that of the commissioned officers of the army and the navy, but lacks the advantage of the retiring pension of three fourths pay. This pension often relieves the military and naval officer of the necessity of saving for old age. The saving required of the academic man to give him an equivalent retiring fund is not practicable at the present salary scale. (2) It shows that the academic salary scale is appreciably lower than that of the professional and scientific services of the national government at Washington. The retiring allowance of the government employee, though small, and in part contributed by the employee himself, gives him a distinct advantage. (3) The salaries of all groups above mentioned are very much lower than those paid in manufacturing enterprises to positions above the wage-earners. In order to make a concrete comparison, I will enumerate the positions that on the average command salaries of $3,000, $6,000 and $9,000 respectively in these different lines of work."

https://openalex.org/W1978071413,Dr. Hale and his collaborators at Mt. Wilson Observatory have studied the general magnetic field of the Sun by spectroscopic measurements of the Zeeman-effect. These researches established the fact that at any given level the distribution of the magnetic field was very similar to the terrestrial distribution. A study of the radial distribution showed that the field decreased radially several thousand times as fast as would be expected if the Sun were uniformly magnetized. This rapid radial variation has made it very difficult to obtain a consistent view of the general magnetic fields of the Sun and Earth.
