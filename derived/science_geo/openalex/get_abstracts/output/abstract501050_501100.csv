https://openalex.org/W1991006646,"Through utilizing the nutrient-rich phloem sap, sap feeding insects such as psyllids, leafhoppers, and aphids can transmit many phloem-restricted pathogens. On the other hand, multiplication of phloem-limited, uncultivated bacteria such as Candidatus Liberibacter asiaticus (CLas) inside the phloem of citrus indicates that the sap contains all the essential nutrients needed for the pathogen growth. The phloem sap composition of many plants has been studied; however, to our knowledge, there is no available data about citrus phloem sap. In this study, we identified and quantified the chemical components of phloem sap from pineapple sweet orange. Two approaches (EDTA enhanced exudation and centrifugation) were used to collect phloem sap. The collected sap was derivatized with methyl chloroformate (MCF), N-methyl-N- [tert-butyl dimethylsilyl]-trifluroacetamide (MTBSTFA), or trimethylsilyl (TMS) and analyzed with GC-MS revealing 20 amino acids and 8 sugars. Proline, the most abundant amino acid, composed more than 60% of the total amino acids. Tryptophan, tyrosine, leucine, isoleucine, and valine, which are considered essential for phloem sap-sucking insects, were also detected. Sucrose, glucose, fructose, and inositol were the most predominant sugars. In addition, seven organic acids including succinic, fumaric, malic, maleic, threonic, citric, and quinic were detected. All compounds detected in the EDTA-enhanced exudate were also detected in the pure phloem sap using centrifugation. The centrifugation technique allowed estimating the concentration of metabolites. This information expands our knowledge about the nutrition requirement for citrus phloem-limited bacterial pathogen and their vectors, and can help define suitable artificial media to culture them."
https://openalex.org/W2028313529,"The transcription factor FoxA2 is a master regulator of endoderm development and pancreatic beta cell gene expression. To elucidate the mechanisms underlying the activation of the FoxA2 gene during differentiation, we have compared the epigenetic status of undifferentiated human embryonic stem cells (hESCs), hESC-derived early endoderm stage cells (CXCR4+ cells), and pancreatic islet cells. Unexpectedly, a CpG island in the promoter region of the FoxA2 gene displayed paradoxically high levels of DNA methylation in expressing tissues (CXCR4+, islets) and low levels in nonexpressing tissues. This CpG island region was found to repress reporter gene expression and bind the Polycomb group protein SUZ12 and the DNA methyltransferase (DNMT)3b preferentially in undifferentiated hESCs as compared with CXCR4+ or islets cells. Consistent with this, activation of FoxA2 gene expression, but not CXCR4 or SOX17, was strongly inhibited by 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine and by knockdown of DNMT3b. We hypothesize that in nonexpressing tissues, the lack of DNA methylation allows the binding of DNA methyltransferases and repressing proteins, such as Polycomb group proteins; upon differentiation, DNMT activation leads to CpG island methylation, causing loss of repressor protein binding. These results suggest a novel and unexpected role for DNA methylation in the activation of FoxA2 gene expression during differentiation."

The consensus map spanned a total length of 1443.84 cM, and consisted of 5,019 SNP markers derived from RAD tag sequencing and 118 publicly available SSR markers distributed in 17 linkage groups, corresponding to the haploid chromosome number of sunflower. The maximum interval between markers in the consensus map is 12.37 cM and the average distance is 0.28 cM between adjacent markers. Despite a few short-distance inversions in marker order, the consensus map showed high levels of collinearity among individual maps with an average Spearman's rank correlation coefficient of 0.972 across the genome. The order of the SSR markers on the consensus map was also in agreement with the order of the individual map and with previously published sunflower maps. Three individual and one consensus maps revealed the uneven distribution of markers across the genome. Additionally, we performed fine mapping and marker validation of the rust resistance gene R12, providing closely linked SNP markers for marker-assisted selection of this gene in sunflower breeding programs. This high resolution consensus map will serve as a valuable tool to the sunflower community for studying marker-trait association of important agronomic traits, marker assisted breeding, map-based gene cloning, and comparative mapping."
https://openalex.org/W2008717037,"Tumor immune tolerance can derive from the recruitment of suppressor cell population, including myeloid derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), able to inhibit T cells activity. We identified a significantly expanded MDSCs population in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) patients at diagnosis that decreased to normal levels after imatinib therapy. In addition, expression of arginase 1 (Arg1) that depletes microenvironment of arginine, an essential aminoacid for T cell function, resulted in an increase in patients at diagnosis. Purified CML CD11b+CD33+CD14-HLADR- cells markedly suppressed normal donor T cell proliferation in vitro. Comparing CML Gr-MDSCs to autologous polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNs) we observed a higher Arg1 expression and activity in PMNs, together with an inhibitory effect on T cells in vitro. Our data indicate that CML cells create an immuno-tolerant environment associated to MDSCs expansion with immunosuppressive capacity mediated by Arg1. In addition, we demonstrated for the first time also an immunosuppressive activity of CML PMNs, suggesting a strong potential immune escape mechanism created by CML cells, which control the anti-tumor reactive T cells. MDSCs should be monitored in imatinib discontinuation trials to understand their importance in relapsing patients."

However, the contaminated blood cells in patients with haematouria significantly altered the expression profiles of urinary microRNA, influencing the test accuracy.MicroRNA profiles of the urine supernatants of UCB patients and controls without any malignancy and profiles of malignant and corresponding normal mucosa tissues from the patients were determined by microRNA microarray and compared to identify differentially expressed microRNAs. The differential expression was verified in the tissues of an independent patient cohort by RT-qPCR. The diagnostic significance of selected microRNAs as biomarkers in the urine supernatant was investigated in the expanded cohorts.MicroRNA-99a and microRNA-125b were down-regulated in the urine supernatants of UCB patients. The degree of down-regulation was associated with the tumor grade. A diagnostic model was developed using a combined index of the levels of microRNA-99a and microRNA-125b in the urine supernatant with a sensitivity of 86.7%, a specificity of 81.1% and a positive predicted value (PPV) of 91.8%. Discriminating between high- and low-grade UCB, the model using the level of microRNA-125b alone exhibited a sensitivity of 81.4%, a specificity of 87.0% and a PPV of 93.4%.The results revealed a unique microRNA expression signature in the urine supernatants of UCB patients for the development of molecular diagnostic tests. An effective cell-free urinary microRNA-based model was developed using a combined index of the levels of microRNA-99a and microRNA-125b to detect UCB with good discriminating power, high sensitivity and high specificity."

Mono-allelic mutations in PALB2 increase the risk of breast, pancreatic, and other cancers, and biallelic mutations cause Fanconi anemia (FA). Like Brca1 and Brca2, systemic knock-out of Palb2 in mice results in embryonic lethality. In this study, we generated a hypomorphic Palb2 allele expressing a mutant PALB2 protein unable to bind BRCA1. Consistent with an FA-like phenotype, cells from the mutant mice showed hypersensitivity and chromosomal breakage when treated with mitomycin C, a DNA interstrand crosslinker. Moreover, mutant males showed reduced fertility due to impaired meiosis and increased apoptosis in germ cells. Interestingly, mutant meiocytes showed a significant defect in sex chromosome synapsis, which likely contributed to the germ cell loss and fertility defect. Our results underscore the in vivo importance of the PALB2-BRCA1 complex formation in DSB repair and male meiosis.

https://openalex.org/W2121681713,"Longitudinal studies of the microbiota are important for discovering changes in microbial communities that affect the host. The complexity of these ecosystems requires rigorous integrated experimental and computational methods to identify temporal signatures that promote physiologic or pathophysiologic responses in vivo. Employing a murine model of infectious colitis with the pathogen Citrobacter rodentium, we generated a 2-month time-series of 16S rDNA gene profiles, and quantitatively cultured commensals, from multiple intestinal sites in infected and uninfected mice. We developed a computational framework to discover time-varying signatures for individual taxa, and to automatically group signatures to identify microbial sub-communities within the larger gut ecosystem that demonstrate common behaviors. Application of this model to the 16S rDNA dataset revealed dynamic alterations in the microbiota at multiple levels of resolution, from effects on systems-level metrics to changes across anatomic sites for individual taxa and species. These analyses revealed unique, time-dependent microbial signatures associated with host responses at different stages of colitis. Signatures included a Mucispirillum OTU associated with early disruption of the colonic surface mucus layer, prior to the onset of symptomatic colitis, and members of the Clostridiales and Lactobacillales that increased with successful resolution of inflammation, after clearance of the pathogen. Quantitative culture data validated findings for predominant species, further refining and strengthening model predictions. These findings provide new insights into the complex behaviors found within host ecosystems, and define several time-dependent microbial signatures that may be leveraged in studies of other infectious or inflammatory conditions."

We reach this conclusion through a study of the technology on quartz from one of the Howiesons Poort layers (Grey Sand) from Sibudu rock shelter. Quartz bifacial technology has previously been described at the site, but this new in-depth study of the quartz technology reveals other strategies. First is the recurring employment of bipolar knapping, formerly considered as a defining feature of the Later Stone Age. Secondly, we highlight a laminar technology with emphasis on small quartz bladelets. Bipolar cores are most common, followed by prismatic cores. The knapping strategies in Grey Sand seem to involve systematic recycling and the deliberate production of microliths."
https://openalex.org/W2036367202,"The monoterpene (+)-3-carene is associated with resistance of Sitka spruce against white pine weevil, a major North American forest insect pest of pine and spruce. High and low levels of (+)-3-carene in, respectively, resistant and susceptible Sitka spruce genotypes are due to variation of (+)-3-carene synthase gene copy number, transcript and protein expression levels, enzyme product profiles, and enzyme catalytic efficiency. A family of multiproduct (+)-3-carene synthase-like genes of Sitka spruce include the three (+)-3-carene synthases, PsTPS-3car1, PsTPS-3car2, PsTPS-3car3, and the (−)-sabinene synthase PsTPS-sab. Of these, PsTPS-3car2 is responsible for the relatively higher levels of (+)-3-carene in weevil-resistant trees. Here, we identified features of the PsTPS-3car1, PsTPS-3car2, PsTPS-3car3, and PsTPS-sab proteins that determine different product profiles. A series of domain swap and site-directed mutations, supported by structural comparisons, identified the amino acid in position 596 as critical for product profiles dominated by (+)-3-carene in PsTPS-3car1, PsTPS-3car2, and PsTPS-3car3, or (−)-sabinene in PsTPS-sab. A leucine in this position promotes formation of (+)-3-carene, whereas phenylalanine promotes (−)-sabinene. Homology modeling predicts that position 596 directs product profiles through differential stabilization of the reaction intermediate. Kinetic analysis revealed position 596 also plays a role in catalytic efficiency. Mutations of position 596 with different side chain properties resulted in a series of enzymes with different product profiles, further highlighting the inherent plasticity and potential for evolution of alternative product profiles of these monoterpene synthases of conifer defense against insects.

White pine weevil (Pissodes strobi) is one of the most devastating insect pests of spruce (Picea spp.) and pine (Pinus spp.). Sitka spruce (Picea sitchensis), a conifer species in which most genotypes are highly susceptible to weevils (1.King J.N. Alfaro R.I. Cartwright C.

Susceptibility to weevils caused the nearly complete halt of commercial Sitka spruce reforestation in the Pacific Northwest. However, successful field trials identified a few highly resistant Sitka spruce genotypes; most notably genotype H898, which has become a focus for research and breeding of conifer resistance to stem boring insects (1.King J.N.

One of the major defenses of conifers against insects is the chemically complex oleoresin, which includes dozens of different monoterpenes and diterpene resin acids (2.Zulak K.G. Lippert D.N.

Resistance was positively associated with higher levels of the bicyclic monoterpene (+)-3-carene (6.Robert J.A. Madilao L.L. White R. Yanchuk A. King J. Bohlmann J.

This work identified a small family of (+)-3-carene synthase-like genes in Sitka spruce that contains the three (+)-3-carene synthases PsTPS-3car1, 3The abbreviations used are: PsP. sitchensisTPSterpene synthaseTPS-car(+)-3-carene synthaseTPS-sab(−)-sabinene synthase. PsTPS-3car2, PsTPS-3car3, and the (−)-sabinene synthase PsTPS-sab. Genotype-specific variations of gene copy number, transcript and protein expression, and catalytic efficiencies of members of this family are responsible for the difference in (+)-3-carene levels (7.Hall D.E. Robert J.A. Keeling C.I. Domanski D. Quesada A.L. Jancsik S. Kuzyk M.A. Hamberger B. Borchers C.H. Bohlmann J.

Specifically, the genomic presence, transcript and protein expression, and enzyme activity of PsTPS-3car2 accounted for much of the high levels of (+)-3-carene in the resistant genotype. P. sitchensis terpene synthase (+)-3-carene synthase (−)-sabinene synthase. Members of the Sitka spruce (+)-3-carene synthase-like family showed between 82.5 and 95.7% pairwise amino acid sequence identity (Fig. 1). These four enzymes are multiproduct enzymes with the same overall product profile of monoterpenes, however, with different relative amounts of individual compounds (7.Hall D.E. Robert J.A. Keeling C.I. Domanski D. Quesada A.L. Jancsik S. Kuzyk M.A. Hamberger B. Borchers C.H. Bohlmann J.

Most notably, PsTPS-3car1, PsTPS-3car2, and PsTPS-3car3 have (+)-3-carene as the predominant product, whereas PsTPS-sab forms (−)-sabinene as the predominant product. All four enzymes produce α-terpinolene as the second most abundant product plus a set of additional minor products (7.Hall D.E. Robert J.A. Keeling C.I. Domanski D. Quesada A.L. Jancsik S.

These similar traits and the particular presence of a (−)-sabinene synthase as a closely related enzyme with a group of (+)-3-carene synthases suggested a pattern of divergent evolution in which PsTPS-sab arose from a PsTPS-3car ancestor through gene duplication and shift of function (7.Hall D.E. Robert J.A. Keeling C.I. Domanski D. Quesada A.L. Jancsik S. Kuzyk M.A. Hamberger B. Borchers C.H. Bohlmann J.

Croteau R. Cyclization enzymes in the biosynthesis of monoterpenes, sesquiterpenes, and diterpenes.Top. Curr. Chem. 2000; 209: 53-95Crossref Google Scholar), PsTPS-3car and PsTPS-sab enzymes are thought to employ divalent metal ion-dependent ionization/isomerization/cyclization reaction mechanisms (Fig. 2). Initial ionization of the substrate geranyl diphosphate allows the formation of linalyl diphosphate. Attack from the allylic double bond upon reionization of linalyl diphosphate results in the formation of the α-terpinyl cation, an important proposed carbocation intermediate for the formation of various cyclic monoterpenes found in the product profiles of PsTPS-3car and PsTPS-sab enzymes. This intermediate can undergo a series of hydride shifts and/or additional cyclizations until reactions are terminated by deprotonation or addition of a nucleophile. Previous work on angiosperm monoterpene synthases has shown how individual amino acids may interact with reaction intermediates and determine product profile. For example, substituting an asparagine to an isoleucine removed the ability of a Salvia fruticosa 1,8-cineole synthase to deprotonate a water molecule in the active site, preventing water capture by the reaction intermediate and altering the reaction pathway to produce sabinene instead of 1,8-cineole as the predominant product (9.Kampranis S.C. Ioannidis D. Purvis A. Mahrez W. Ninga E. Katerelos N.A. Anssour S. Dunwell J.M. Degenhardt J. Makris A.M. Rational conversion of substrate and product specificity in a Salvia monoterpene synthase: structural insights into the evolution of terpene synthase function.Plant Cell. 2007; 19: 1994-2005Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Similarly, stereo-specificity of two Thymus vulgaris sabinene hydrate synthases was inter-converted by reciprocal substitution between a pair isoleucine and asparagine residues (10.Krause S.T. Köllner T.G. Asbach J. Degenhardt J. Stereochemical mechanism of two sabinene hydrate synthases forming antipodal monoterpenes in thyme (Thymus vulgaris).Arch. Biochem.

The high sequence similarity yet different product profiles of the Sitka spruce PsTPS-3car and PsTPS-sab enzymes, and their different roles in contributing to insect resistance, has made them attractive targets for investigating which particular structural features of these enzymes affect their functions. Here, we used domain-swapping and site-directed mutagenesis, guided by sequence comparisons and supported by structural homology modeling, to test which specific domains and amino acids direct PsTPS-3car versus PsTPS-sab product profile and how these domains and amino acids might interact with the reaction intermediates. Our results indicate changes of sequence and functions that may have occurred in the natural evolution of the (+)-3-carene synthase-like family of spruce defense.

To determine enzyme kinetic parameters, assays were performed with nine different concentrations of geranyl diphosphate ranging from 1 to 60 μm. PsTPS-3car2 (WT) was assayed for 20 min at 30 °C; all other enzymes were assayed for 10 min at 30 °C.

Compounds were quantified using response factors calculated by comparison to a known concentration of isobutylbenzene. Homology models for the (+)-3-carene synthase-like enzymes and their variants were produced using the SWISS-MODEL server (13.Arnold K. Bordoli L. Kopp J. Schwede T.

Models were based on the structure of Salvia officinalis (+)-bornyl diphosphate synthase (PDB code 1N22) containing the substrate analog (4R)-7-aza-7,8-dihydrolimonene (16.Whittington D.A. Wise M.L. Urbansky M. Coates R.M. Croteau R.B. Christianson D.W. Bornyl diphosphate synthase: structure and strategy for carbocation manipulation by a terpenoid cyclase.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Ramachandran plots of all models verified high stereochemical quality having greater than 90% of residues in most favored regions. Energy-minimized ligands for docking were produced using the PRODRG server (17.Schüttelkopf A.W. van Aalten D.M. PRODRG: a tool for high-throughput crystallography of protein-ligand complexes.Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2004; 60: 1355-1363Crossref PubMed Scopus (4277) Google Scholar). Docking studies with the α-terpinyl cation and the protein models were performed using Molegro Virtual Docking. The substrate analog (4R)-7-aza-7,8-dihydrolimonene was used as a positional template for docking. Because this analog is inverted in the active site of the S. officinalis (+)-bornyl diphosphate synthase crystal structure, similarity measurements used in the template docking parameters were relaxed to allow for increased flexibility in the positioning of the α-terpinyl cation. This resulted in two to three of the top five most energetically favorable positions of the α-terpinyl cation oriented in the appropriate direction. Of these, the most energetically favorable position was used. The results were visualized in PyMOL. We performed a series of domain swaps and site-directed substitutions between PsTPS-sab and PsTPS-3car to explore which regions and specific amino acids of these enzymes affect the differences of their product profiles.

The α-domain of these enzymes adopts an α-α barrel structure comprised of 14 helixes and two loops, which harbors the class I active site (Fig. 1). To test if product profiles could be altered through mutation of the α-domain as seen in other TPS-d1 monoterpene synthases (19.Katoh S. Hyatt D. Croteau R.

Rev. 1987; 87: 929-954Crossref Scopus (474) Google Scholar), an initial domain swap was performed on PsTPS-sab wild type (WT) enzyme so its helix A-helix K region would be identical to that of PsTPS-3car2 (WT) (Table 1). The resulting enzyme (variant 1) showed a product profile nearly identical to that of PsTPS-3car2 (WT), producing 66.1% (+)-3-carene and 6.9% (−)-sabinene plus other additional monoterpenes (Table 1, supplemental Table S1), indicating successful conversion into a PsTPS-3car type (+)-3-carene synthase. To identify the specific regions that caused this change in product profile, four additional domain swaps were performed on PsTPS-sab (WT): helix A-helix E (variant 2), helix F-helix G1/2 (variant 3), helix H1-helix I (variant 4), and helix J-helix K (variant 5). Of these, variants 2, 3, and 4 showed no substantial change in product profile compared with PsTPS-sab (WT); however, variant 5 displayed a product profile containing 44.9% (+)-3-carene and 9.5% (−)-sabinene (Table 1). To narrow down which parts of the helix J-helix K region caused this change, we performed separate substitutions of helix J (variant 6), J/K loop, and helix K on PsTPS-sab (WT). Changes of the J/K loop and helix K regions had no effect on product profile compared with PsTPS-sab (WT). In contrast, variant 6 produced a profile similar to that of PsTPS-3car of 39.7% (+)-3-carene and 9.2% (−)-sabinene (Table 1). In summary, these results indicated that sequence variation in the 11-amino acid long helix J region were responsible for much of the difference of PsTPS-sab and PsTPS-3car product profiles. Of the four amino acids in the helix J region that differ between PsTPS-sab and PsTPS-3car2 (Fig. 1), individual site-directed substitution in positions 589 (variant 7), 595 (variant 8), and 599 (variant 10) produced no change in product profile relative to PsTPS-sab (WT). However, substitution of the Leu in position 596 (variant 9), an amino acid conserved across all known conifer TPS-3car enzymes, to Phe produced an enzyme with a product profile of 28.6% (+)-3-carene and 18.7% (−)-sabinene (Table 1, Fig. 3d). The proportion of (+)-3-carene in the product profile of PsTPS-sab variant 9 was less compared with the product profiles of variants 5 and 6, suggesting that at least one of the conserved Ala589, Gly595, and Phe599 of the PsTPS-3car enzymes has a synergistic effect with Leu596 on (+)-3-carene formation. To test this hypothesis, we assessed the product profiles of all six possible PsTPS-sab variants that were produced from combinations of variant 9 with additional substitutions in positions 589, 595, and/or 599. Of these, variant 11 produced the highest levels of (+)-3-carene and a product profile closest to variants 5 and 6 with 42.3% (+)-3-carene and 7.3% (−)-sabinene (Table 1). The observed effects these substitutions had on product profile identified Phe596 as critical in PsTPS-sab for determining (−)-sabinene as the major product, and Leu596 as critical for (+)-3-carene formation in the mutated PsTPS-sab enzyme with positions Gly595 and Phe599 providing synergistic effects. In turn, it can be proposed these three amino acids play an important role in (+)-3-carene formation in PsTPS-3car. The three helix J amino acid substitutions Ala595-Gly, Phe596-Leu, and Leu599-Phe of PsTPS-sab variant 11 explained the product profile changes observed in variants 5 and 6 relative to PsTPS-sab (WT); however, the (+)-3-carene biosynthesis levels of variant 11 were only two-thirds of that observed in PsTPS-sab variant 1 and PsTPS-3car2 (WT). To elucidate which additional amino acids promote (+)-3-carene biosynthesis, we performed further domain swaps to variant 6 with the helix A-helix E, helix F-helix G1/2, and helix H-helix I regions of PsTPS-3car2 (variants 12, 13, and 14, respectively). Of the resulting enzymes, variants 13 and 14 showed no increase in (+)-3-carene formation, whereas variant 12 produced a product profile containing 56.2% (+)-3-carene and 7.5% (−)-sabinene. Next, we divided the helix A-helix E region of PsTPS-3car2 into six smaller regions based on individual helices and loops for the design of additional domain swaps in the background of PsTPS-sab variant 6. Of these, the additional swap of helix A (variant 15) and the A/C loop (variant 16) showed no increase in (+)-3-carene formation compared with variant 6. Additional swaps of helix C (variant 17), helix D (variant 18), helix D1-D2 (variant 19), and helix E (variant 20) all showed slight increases in (+)-3-carene resulting in product profiles that contained, respectively, 45.4, 50.8, 45.5, and 43.8% (+)-3-carene and 5.2, 4.1, 8.2, and 8.2% (−)-sabinene. These results suggest that some or all of the 13 amino acids that differ between PsTPS-3car2 (WT) and PsTPS-sab (WT) within the helix C-E region provide additional synergistic effects to (+)-3-carene formation. To substantiate results obtained with substitutions in PsTPS-sab according to which positions 595, 596, and 599 are critical for determining the predominant (−)-sabinene or (+)-3-carene product profiles of PsTPS-sab and PsTPS-3car, respectively, we made the reciprocal substitutions corresponding to PsTPS-sab variants 6, 9, and 11 in each of the three different PsTPS-3car enzymes, PsTPS-3car1, PsTPS-3car2, and PsTPS-3car3 (Table 1). These substitutions in the PsTPS-3car1 (WT) background resulted in variants 21, 22, and 23 and reduced the formation of (+)-3-carene to 1.4 (variant 21), 5.0 (variant 22), and 1.8% (variant 23) of the overall product profile compared with 49.2% in PsTPS-3car1 (WT) (Table 1). These variant PsTPS-3car1 enzymes produced (−)-sabinene at 23.0, 20.9, and 23.3% of total product profile, respectively; compared with 8.7% in PsTPS-3car1 (WT). Although α-terpinolene was the major product at 56.4, 53.5, and 55.2% of product profile, respectively, these substitutions all caused a large increase in (−)-sabinene product levels. The same three substitutions in PsTPS-3car2 (WT) resulted in variants 24, 25, and 26 with (−)-sabinene as the major product at 47.9, 37.4, and 47.4% of total product profile, respectively (Table 1, Fig. 3). In PsTPS-3car3 (WT), the same three substitutions resulted in variants 27, 28, and 29, again with (−)-sabinene as the major product in the helix J substitution (variant 27; 37.7%) and in the triple amino acid substitution variant 29 (29.0%). (−)-Sabinene was also the second most abundant product in the position 596 variant 28 with 20.2% of product profile, respectively. These r"

https://openalex.org/W2053231941,"The study of the holotype and of a new specimen of Nanchangosaurus suni (Reptilia; Diapsida; Hupehsuchia) revealed a suite of hitherto unrecognized characters. For example, Nanchangosaurus has bipartite neural spines and its vertebral count is nearly identical to that of Hupehsuchus. It differs from the latter in having poorly developed forelimbs despite the advanced ossification in the rest of the skeleton. Other differences all pertain to hupehsuchian plesiomorphies retained in Nanchangosaurus, such as low neural spines. The relationship of Hupehsuchia within Diapsida was analyzed based on a data matrix containing 41 taxa coded for 213 characters, of which 18 were identified as aquatic adaptations from functional inferences. These aquatic adaptations may be vulnerable to the argumentation of character homology because expectation for homoplasy is high. There is an apparent incongruence between phylogenetic signals from aquatic adaptations and the rest of the data, with aquatic adaptations favoring all marine reptiles but Helveticosaurus to form a super-clade. However, this super-clade does not obtain when aquatic adaptations were deleted, whereas individual marine reptile clades are all derived without them. We examined all possible combinations of the 18 aquatic adaptations (n = 262143) and found that four lineages of marine reptiles are recognized almost regardless of which of these features were included in the analysis: Hupehsuchia-Ichthyopterygia clade, Sauropterygia-Saurosphargidae clade, Thalattosauria, and Helveticosaurus. The interrelationships among these four depended on the combination of aquatic adaptations to be included, i.e., assumed to be homologous a priori by bypassing character argumentation. Hupehsuchia always appeared as the sister taxon of Ichthyopterygia."
https://openalex.org/W1994043269,"Co-adaptive training paradigms for event-related desynchronization (ERD) based brain-computer interfaces (BCI) have proven effective for healthy users. As of yet, it is not clear whether co-adaptive training paradigms can also benefit users with severe motor impairment. The primary goal of our paper was to evaluate a novel cue-guided, co-adaptive BCI training paradigm with severely impaired volunteers. The co-adaptive BCI supports a non-control state, which is an important step toward intuitive, self-paced control. A secondary aim was to have the same participants operate a specifically designed self-paced BCI training paradigm based on the auto-calibrated classifier. The co-adaptive BCI analyzed the electroencephalogram from three bipolar derivations (C3, Cz, and C4) online, while the 22 end users alternately performed right hand movement imagery (MI), left hand MI and relax with eyes open (non-control state). After less than five minutes, the BCI auto-calibrated and proceeded to provide visual feedback for the MI task that could be classified better against the non-control state. The BCI continued to regularly recalibrate. In every calibration step, the system performed trial-based outlier rejection and trained a linear discriminant analysis classifier based on one auto-selected logarithmic band-power feature. In 24 minutes of training, the co-adaptive BCI worked significantly (p = 0.01) better than chance for 18 of 22 end users. The self-paced BCI training paradigm worked significantly (p = 0.01) better than chance in 11 of 20 end users. The presented co-adaptive BCI complements existing approaches in that it supports a non-control state, requires very little setup time, requires no BCI expert and works online based on only two electrodes. The preliminary results from the self-paced BCI paradigm compare favorably to previous studies and the collected data will allow to further improve self-paced BCI systems for disabled users."

However, what exactly happens during learning remains unclear. Using eye-tracking, we examined infants’ attention to object parts during learning. Our analysis of looking behaviors during learning provide insights going beyond merely observing the learning outcome. Both labeling and non-labeling phrases facilitated category formation in 12-month-olds but not 8-month-olds (Experiment 1). Non-linguistic sounds did not produce this effect (Experiment 2). Detailed analyses of infants’ looking patterns during learning revealed that only infants who heard labels exhibited a rapid focus on the object part successive exemplars had in common. Although other linguistic stimuli may also be beneficial for learning, it is therefore concluded that labels have a unique impact on categorization."
https://openalex.org/W2040776903,"Nisin, a 3.4 kDa antimicrobial peptide produced by some Lactococcus lactis strains is the most prominent member of the lantibiotic family. Nisin can inhibit cell growth and penetrates the target Gram-positive bacterial membrane by binding to Lipid II, an essential cell wall synthesis precursor. The assembled nisin-Lipid II complex forms pores in the target membrane. To gain immunity against its own-produced nisin, Lactococcus lactis is expressing two immunity protein systems, NisI and NisFEG. Here, we show that the NisI expressing strain displays an IC50 of 73±10 nM, an 8–10-fold increase when compared to the non-expressing sensitive strain. When the nisin concentration is raised above 70 nM, the cells expressing full-length NisI stop growing rather than being killed. NisI is inhibiting nisin mediated pore formation, even at nisin concentrations up to 1 µM. This effect is induced by the C-terminus of NisI that protects Lipid II. Its deletion showed pore formation again. The expression of NisI in combination with externally added nisin mediates an elongation of the chain length of the Lactococcus lactis cocci. While the sensitive strain cell-chains consist mainly of two cells, the NisI expressing cells display a length of up to 20 cells. Both results shed light on the immunity of lantibiotic producer strains, and their survival in high levels of their own lantibiotic in the habitat."
https://openalex.org/W2005873445,"Digested proteins are mainly absorbed as small peptides composed of two or three amino acids. The intestinal absorption of small peptides is mediated via only one transport system: the proton-coupled peptide transporter-1 (PepT1) encoded from the soluble carrier protein Slc15a1. In mammals, intestinal expression of PepT1/Slc15a1 oscillates during the daily feeding cycle. Although the oscillation in the intestinal expression of PepT1/Slc15a1 is suggested to be controlled by molecular components of circadian clock, we demonstrated here that bile acids regulated the oscillation of PepT1/Slc15a1 expression through modulating the activity of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α (PPARα). Nocturnally active mice mainly consumed their food during the dark phase. PPARα activated the intestinal expression of Slc15a1 mRNA during the light period, and protein levels of PepT1 peaked before the start of the dark phase. After food intake, bile acids accumulated in intestinal epithelial cells. Intestinal accumulated bile acids interfered with recruitment of co-transcriptional activator CREB-binding protein/p300 on the promoter region of Slc15a1 gene, thereby suppressing PPARα-mediated transactivation of Slc15a1. The time-dependent suppression of PPARα-mediated transactivation by bile acids caused an oscillation in the intestinal expression of PepT1/Slc15a1 during the daily feeding cycle that led to circadian changes in the intestinal absorption of small peptides.

The suprachiasmatic nucleus circadian oscillators are entrained to a 24-h period by daily light input from the visual neural system and produce output signals for coordinating the phase of independent oscillators in peripheral tissues. The peripheral oscillators generate daily rhythms in output physiology through the periodic activation/repression of clock-controlled output genes (14.Jin X. Shearman L.P. Weaver D.R.

Although the light/dark cycle is the most powerful “Zeitgeber” for the suprachiasmatic nucleus oscillators in mammals (17.Caldelas I. Poirel V.J. Sicard B. Pévet P. Challet E.

Cermakian N. Molecular circadian rhythms in central and peripheral clocks in mammals.Chronobiol.

Albrecht U. Challet E. “Feeding time” for the brain: a matter of clocks.J. Physiol. Paris. 2006; 100: 252-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The intestinal expressions of Slc15a1/PepT1 are induced by situations of fasting or starvation (20.Shimakura J. Terada T. Saito H. Katsura T. Inui K. Induction of intestinal peptide transporter 1 expression during fasting is mediated via peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α.Am. J. Physiol. Gastrointest. Liver Physiol. 2006; 291: G851-G856Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Fasting-induced expression of Slc15a1 mRNA is suggested to be mediated via peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-α (PPARα). A number of endogenous substrates such as polyunsaturated fatty acids serve as ligand activators of this nuclear receptor (21.Göttlicher M. Widmark E. Li Q. Gustafsson J.A. Fatty acids activate a chimera of the clofibric acid-activated receptor and the glucocorticoid receptor.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1992; 89: 4653-4657Crossref PubMed Scopus (798) Google Scholar, 22.Keller H. Dreyer C. Medin J. Mahfoudi A. Ozato K. Wahli W.

U.S.A. 1993; 90: 2160-2164Crossref PubMed Scopus (858) Google Scholar). Because plasma levels of free fatty acids are elevated during the fasting state (23.Leone T.C. Weinheimer C.J. Kelly D.P. A critical role for the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPARα) in the cellular fasting response: the PPARα-null mouse as a model of fatty acid oxidation disorders.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1999; 96: 7473-7478Crossref PubMed Scopus (819) Google Scholar), the elevation is thought to trigger fasting-induced activation of PPARα. Conversely, several bile salts also have the ability to modulate the activity of PPARα and the expression of its target genes (24.Sinal C.J. Yoon M. Gonzalez F.J. Antagonism of the actions of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-α by bile acids.J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 47154-47162Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The secretion of bile acids and intestinal absorption of fatty acids likely change during the daily feeding cycle. However, it remains to be clarified whether interaction between these compounds and PPARα is involved in the circadian regulation of the intestinal expression of Slc15a1/PepT1. In this study, we found that the suppressing action of bile acids on PPARα activity caused oscillation in the intestinal expression of Slc15a1/PepT1 during the daily feeding cycle. In mammals, PepT1 is responsible for the absorption of small peptides arising from digestion of dietary proteins. Therefore, we investigated the physiological significance of the modulatory action of bile acids on PPARα activity for the function of PepT1 to absorb small peptides. PPARα-null mice (129S4-Svjae-PPARαmuGonzN12) with a JcI:ICR background, Period2 gene mutant (Per2m/m), and wild-type mice of the same strain were fed ad libitum before the experiments. Animals were treated in accordance with the guidelines stipulated by the Animal Care and Use Committee of Kyushu University. To investigate the influence of fasting on intestinal gene expression, mice were also forced to fast for 24-h starting at zeitgeber time (ZT) 0 and then fed ad libitum. During the manipulation of the feeding schedule, water was freely available. The human colon carcinoma cell line Caco-2 was obtained from the American Type Culture Collection and maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 1× nonessential amino acids. Cells were transfected with siRNA (20 nm) against PPARα (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) and used for experiments at 48 h after transfection. Down-regulation of PPARα expression was confirmed by Western blotting. The PPARα-down-regulated cells were treated with the PPAR ligand WY-14643, cholic acid (Wako Chemicals, Osaka, Japan), or 0.05% DMSO/0.25% ethanol as a control for the indicated times. Epithelial cells were collected from the small intestine of mice. For assessment of free fatty acids, 30 mg of cells were homogenized with 200 μl of chloroform/Triton X-100 (1% Triton X-100 in pure chloroform). After centrifugation at 15,000 rpm for 15 min, the organic phase (lower phase) was collected and dried at 50 °C to remove chloroform. The dried lipid samples were dissolved in assay buffer, and concentrations of free fatty acids were determined using the Free Fatty Acid Quantification kit (Abcam, Cambridge, UK). For assessment of bile acids, 30 mg of cells were homogenized with 1.0 ml of 70% ethanol and then incubated at 55 °C for 4 h. The ethanol extracts were evaporated to dryness and resuspended in 300 μl of 0.5 m phosphate buffer (pH 7.0). Concentrations of total bile acids were determined using the Total Bile Acid Assay kit (Diazyme Laboratories, CA). The composition of free fatty acid and bile salt species in epithelial cells of the small intestine was analyzed by GC/MS. Fatty acids in epithelial cells were subjected to acid or alkaline methanolysis to produce fatty acid methyl esters. The methyl ester derivatives were extracted in an organic solvent and analyzed by GC/MS. The GC/MS analysis of bile acids was carried out by using selected ion monitoring of characteristic fragments of methyl ester dimethylethylsilyl ether methoxime bile acid derivatives. The lipid contents in epithelial cells were expressed as μmol/g of tissue. The epithelial cells were removed from the intestinal segments of mice and homogenized using RNAiso reagent (Takara Bio Inc.). Real time RT-PCR was performed using SYBR Premix Ex Taq II (Takara Bio Inc.) or THUNDERBIRD (Toyobo Co. Ltd.) using a LightCycler (Roche Diagnostics). The reaction conditions were 95 °C for 10 s followed by 45 cycles at 95 °C for 5 s, 57 °C for 10 s, and 72 °C for 10 s. Sequences for PCR primers are given in Table 1. The amount of target mRNA was corrected relative to that of β-actin.TABLE 1Primer sets for RT-PCR analysisGenePrimersMouse Bmal1Forward5′-CCGATGACGAACTGAAACACCT-3′Reverse5′-TGCAGTGTCCGAGGAAGATAGC-3′Mouse DbpForward5′-GCGAGAAGTGCAAAATTGGC-3′Reverse5′-CGGGAGGCTCCTATAGTCTGG-3′Mouse Slc15a1Forward5′-CGTGTGGTAAAAGATGGTCCTAA-3′Reverse5′-CGTTGTGACTTGTGAATTTTTCAT-3′Mouse β-actinForward5′-CACACCTTCTACAATGAGCTGC-3′Reverse5′-CATGATCTGGGTCATCTTTTCA-3′Human SLC15A1Forward5′-ATTGTGTCG CTCTCCATTGTCTAC-3′Reverse5′-ATGGTTGTGGTCTGTGAGGTCAT-3′Human β-actinForward5′-AGAGCTACGAGCTGCCTGAC-3′Reverse5′-AGCACTGTGTTGGCGTACAG-3′ Open table in a new tab The 5′-flanking region of the mouse Slc15a1 gene spanning from bp −1946 to +3 (the number is the distance in base pairs from the putative transcription start site, +1) was amplified by PCR, and the product was ligated into the pGL4.12 luciferase reporter vector (Slc15a1-luciferase). The peroxisome proliferator response element (PPRE) located between bp −1876 and −1864 with respect to the transcription start site of the mouse Slc15a1 gene was mutated from AGGTCAAAGAAGA to AGGTCTCGAGAGA using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The PPRE located between bp −1693 and −1681 with respect to the transcription start site was also changed from AGGTGATAAATGA to AGGTCTCGAGTGA using the same reagent. Expression vectors for mouse PPARα and retinoid X receptor-α (RXRα) were constructed using a cDNA generated from mouse liver RNA by RT-PCR. All coding regions were ligated into the pcDNA3.1 vector (Invitrogen). The NIH3T3 cells were seeded at a density of 1 × 105/24-well culture plate. The cells were transfected 18 h later with 100 ng/well reporter vectors and 1–2 μg/well (total) expression vectors. The pRL-TK vector (0.5 ng/well; Promega) was also co-transfected as an internal control reporter. The cells were then harvested, and the cell lysates were analyzed using a Dual-Luciferase reporter assay system (Promega). The ratio of firefly (expressed from the reporter construct) to Renilla (expressed from pRL-TK) luciferase activities in each sample served as a measure of normalized luciferase activity. The reporter vector-transfected cells were also treated with WY-14643, cholic acid, or 0.05% DMSO/0.25% ethanol as a control for the indicated times. Luciferase activities in each sample were assessed as described above. Cross-linked chromatin in epithelial cells from the small intestine was sonicated on ice, and nuclear fractions were obtained by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 5 min. Supernatants were incubated with antibodies against PPARα (H-98), RXRα (D-20), CREB-binding protein (CBP)/p300 (N-15), or rabbit IgG (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). DNA was isolated using the GeneElute mammalian genomic DNA kit (Sigma) and amplified by PCR for the surrounding PPREs in the 5′-flanking region of the Slc15a1 gene. Primer sequences for amplification of the surrounding or outside PPREs are given in Table 2. The quantitative reliability of PCR was evaluated by kinetic analysis of the amplified products to ensure that signals were only derived from the exponential phase of amplification. ChIP in the absence of an antibody and in the presence of rabbit IgG served as negative controls. Ethidium bromide staining did not detect any PCR products in these samples.TABLE 2Primer sets for ChIP analysisGenePrimersSet 1Forward5′-GAGCTCTCAGAGGGAGCACA-3′Reverse5′-TGCACCGGACAAACGGAAAC-3′Set 2Forward5′-TGTGACTCTCAGTGTAGAGG-3′Reverse5′-CATCTACCCCATTCATGCAC-3′Set 3Forward5′-AACAACCAAAGGAAACCTCA-3′Reverse5′-GAGTCTTCCACATTCGCTTT-3′ Open table in a new tab Cell membrane fractions were prepared from small intestine epithelial cells. Fractions containing 20 μg of total protein were resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane that was incubated with antibodies against PepT1 (H-235, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or Na+/K+-ATPase (Abcam). Specific antigen-antibody complexes were visualized using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies and Chemi-Lumi One (Nacalai Tesque Inc., Kyoto, Japan). Nuclear extracts were also prepared from Caco-2 cells. Protein levels of PPARα, RXRα, and β-actin were assessed by the same method. The antibodies against PPARα (H-98), RXRα (D-20), or β-actin (C4) were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Mice were orally administrated carnosine (1.75 mg/g), and blood samples were collected by cardiac puncture. Plasma was obtained by centrifugation at 10,000 rpm for 10 min. The supernatant was deproteinized with 0.36 m perchloric acid and centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 5 min, and the supernatant was then used as a sample. The concentration of carnosine was determined using a high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) system with a fluorescence detector. Carnosine was derivatized with o-phthalaldehyde (Sigma). The mobile phase consisting of 1.25% methanol and 0.75% sodium acetate (0.3 m, pH5.5) was eluted at 0.8 ml/min through a COSMOSIL 5C18-MS-II column (4.6 × 150 mm; Nacalai Tesque Inc.) maintained at 40 °C. The separated analyte was detected using an RF-550 spectrofluorometric detector (Hitachi) with excitation at 310 nm and emission at 375 nm. The significance of differences between groups was validated by the Bonferroni test for multiple comparisons and Student's t test for comparisons between two groups. The 5% level of probability was considered to be significant. Bile salts are released from the gallbladder into the small intestine in response to food intake. When food is plentiful, nocturnally active mice ingest most of their food during the dark phase (25.Ritskes-Hoitinga M. Hedrich H. The Laboratory Mouse. Elsevier Academic Press, New York2004: 463-479Crossref Scopus (15) Google Scholar). We first investigated the relationship between temporal feeding patterns and the accumulation of fatty and bile acids in intestinal epithelial cells. As reported previously (25.Ritskes-Hoitinga M. Hedrich H. The Laboratory Mouse. Elsevier Academic Press, New York2004: 463-479Crossref Scopus (15) Google Scholar), mice consumed ∼80% of their food during the dark phase when they were fed ad libitum (Fig. 1A). Under this feeding condition, the amount of free fatty acids in the intestinal epithelial cells of mice exhibited an obvious circadian oscillation with higher levels being observed during the dark phase (Fig. 1B). This oscillation in the amount of free fatty acids was markedly dampened by 24 h of fasting; it remained at low levels throughout the fasting period. After mice resumed food intake, the amount of free fatty acids in the intestines increased during the light phase due to the resumption of feeding. A similar temporal variation was also observed in the accumulation of bile acids in the intestinal epithelial cells of mice during the manipulation of the feeding schedule (Fig. 1C). Because bile acids are secreted into the lumen of the small intestine by stimulation of food intake, the change in the temporal accumulation pattern of bile acids also appeared to be caused by the alteration in daily pattern of food intake. GC/MS analysis detected 12 types of fatty acids and their derivatives in the intestinal epithelial cells of wild-type mice (Fig. 1D). The main composition of these fatty acids was palmitic acid (16:0), stearic acid (18:0), oleic acid (18:1), linolenic acid (18:2n-2), and arachidonic acid (20:4n-6). Among them, the amount of oleic acid (18:1) and linoleic acid (18:2n-2) showed significant time-dependent variations in the epithelial cells of mice under the ad libitum feeding condition (p < 0.05, respectively). Composition analysis by GC/MS also detected seven types of bile acids and their derivatives in the intestinal epithelial cells (Fig. 1E). The main composition of these bile salts was cholic acid (CA), the amount of which exhibited significant time-dependent variations under the ad libitum feeding (p < 0.05). These results indicated that the intake of food also caused the daily accumulation of bile acids in intestinal epithelial cells. The temporal accumulation of bile acids was attributed to an increase in the amount of CA. Under the ad libitum feeding condition, the mRNA levels of circadian clock genes Dbp and Bmal1 in the small intestine of mice exhibited obvious circadian oscillations (Fig. 2A). The rhythmic phase of Dbp mRNA was nearly antiphase to that of Bmal1 expression. The mRNA levels of Slc15a1 also showed obvious circadian oscillation under ad libitum feeding conditions (Fig. 2B); the mRNA levels gradually increased during the light phase and then decreased after the start of the dark phase. Although the mRNA levels of Dbp and Bmal1 still exhibited circadian oscillations during and after 24 h of fasting (Fig. 2A), the expression pattern of Slc15a1 mRNA markedly changed by the manipulation of the feeding schedule; Slc15a1 mRNA levels increased during 24 h of fasting, and expression levels decreased after the resumption of feeding (Fig. 2B). Increases and decreases in Slc15a1 mRNA levels during manipulation of the feeding schedule were in contrast to the accumulation pattern of fatty and bile acids in intestinal epithelial cells (Fig. 1, B and C). Next we investigated the possibility that fatty and bile acids could modulate the expression of Slc15a1 in the intestinal epithelial cells. To this end, intestinal segments were isolated from mice and then incubated for 2 h with fatty or bile acids whose intestinal concentrations exhibited significant time-dependent variation (Fig. 1, D and E). Treatment of wild-type mouse intestinal segments prepared at ZT10 and ZT22 with fatty acids had little effect on the mRNA levels of Slc15a1 (Fig. 2C). Furthermore, no significant change in the expression of Slc15a1 mRNA in the isolated intestinal segments was observed even when the segments were treated with 400 μm WY-14643 (data not shown). Conversely, treatment of wild-type mouse intestinal segments prepared at ZT10, but not ZT22, with CA dose-dependently suppressed the expression of Slc15a1 mRNA (Fig. 2D). The suppression effects of CA were significant at a concentration over 500 μm (p < 0.05). Under the ad libitum feeding condition, the levels of Slc15a1 mRNA in the small intestine of mice increased during their rest period (light phase). Furthermore, the mRNA levels of Slc15a1 were also elevated by 24 h of fasting. Fasting-induced expression of Slc15a1 mRNA is suggested to be mediated via the nuclear receptor PPARα (20.Shimakura J. Terada T. Saito H. Katsura T. Inui K. Induction of intestinal peptide transporter 1 expression during fasting is mediated via peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α.Am. J. Physiol. Gastrointest. Liver Physiol. 2006; 291: G851-G856Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Therefore, we also tested whether bile acids could suppress the Slc15a1 expression in PPARα-null mice. Although the mRNA levels of Slc15a1 in intestinal segments of PPARα-null mice were reduced at both ZT10 and ZT22, no significant suppression effects of CA on the expression of Slc15a1 were detected in PPARα-null mice (Fig. 2D). These results indicated that bile acids suppressed the intestinal expression of Slc15a1 by inhibiting PPARα-mediated transactivation. To assess the potential involvement of PPARα in bile acid-repressed expression of Slc15a1 in intestinal cells, we also examined the influence of CA on the mRNA levels of SLC15A1 in PPARα-down-regulated Caco-2 cells, which are often used as an in vitro model of the intestinal system. The expression of endogenous PPARα proteins in Caco-2 cells was down-regulated by transfection with siRNA against PPARα (Fig. 3A), but PPARα protein levels were not obviously changed by transfection of cells with control siRNA. The mRNA levels of SLC15A1 in control siRNA-transfected Caco-2 cells were elevated significantly in response to treatment with the PPARα ligand WY-14643 (Fig. 3B). The PPARα ligand-induced expression of SLC15A1 was dose-dependently repressed by CA treatment (Fig. 3B). Conversely, treatment of PPARα-down-regulated cells with the same concentration of WY-14643 resulted in a moderate induction of SLC15A1 mRNA (Fig. 3B). Therefore, CA had little effect on the mRNA levels of SLC15A1 in PPARα-down-regulated cells. PPARα has been shown to heterodimerize with RXRα to activate the transcription of their target genes by binding to PPREs (26.Forman B.M. Chen J. Evans R.M. Hypolipidemic drugs, polyunsaturated fatty acids, and eicosanoids are ligands for peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors α and δ.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1997; 94: 4312-4317Crossref PubMed Scopus (1861) Google Scholar). Two nucleotide sequences showing homology with PPREs were detected within 2.0 kilobases (kb) of the 5′-flanking region of the mouse Slc15a1 gene, and similar PPRE sequences were also found in the upstream region of the human SLC15A gene. Thus, we also performed a transcription assay by transfecting NIH3T3 cells with the mouse Slc15a1-luciferase reporters. Although the mouse Slc15a1-luciferase reporter construct containing wild-type PPREs responded to PPARα/RXRα, mutation of PPREs attenuated the PPARα/RXRα-mediated transactivation of Slc15a1 (Fig. 3C). The PPARα/RXRα-mediated transactivation of Slc15a1 was further enhanced by treatment with 200 μm WY-14643. However, the enhan"
https://openalex.org/W2083127534,"The human ZFP36 zinc finger protein family consists of ZFP36, ZFP36L1, and ZFP36L2. These proteins regulate various cellular processes, including cell apoptosis, by binding to adenine uridine rich elements in the 3′ untranslated regions of sets of target mRNAs to promote their degradation. The pro-apoptotic and other functions of ZFP36 family members have been implicated in the pathogenesis of lymphoid malignancies. To identify candidate mRNAs that are targeted in the pro-apoptotic response by ZFP36L1, we reverse-engineered a gene regulatory network for all three ZFP36 family members using the ‘maximum information coefficient’ (MIC) for target gene inference on a large microarray gene expression dataset representing cells of diverse histological origin. Of the three inferred ZFP36L1 mRNA targets that were identified, we focussed on experimental validation of mRNA for the pro-survival protein, BCL2, as a target for ZFP36L1. RNA electrophoretic mobility shift assay experiments revealed that ZFP36L1 interacted with the BCL2 adenine uridine rich element. In murine BCL1 leukemia cells stably transduced with a ZFP36L1 ShRNA lentiviral construct, BCL2 mRNA degradation was significantly delayed compared to control lentiviral expressing cells and ZFP36L1 knockdown in different cell types (BCL1, ACHN, Ramos), resulted in increased levels of BCL2 mRNA levels compared to control cells. 3′ untranslated region luciferase reporter assays in HEK293T cells showed that wild type but not zinc finger mutant ZFP36L1 protein was able to downregulate a BCL2 construct containing the BCL2 adenine uridine rich element and removal of the adenine uridine rich core from the BCL2 3′ untranslated region in the reporter construct significantly reduced the ability of ZFP36L1 to mediate this effect. Taken together, our data are consistent with ZFP36L1 interacting with and mediating degradation of BCL2 mRNA as an important target through which ZFP36L1 mediates its pro-apoptotic effects in malignant B-cells."
https://openalex.org/W2039558800,"Starch synthase (SS) and branching enzyme (BE) establish the two glycosidic linkages existing in starch. Both enzymes exist as several isoforms. Enzymes derived from several species were studied extensively both in vivo and in vitro over the last years, however, analyses of a functional interaction of SS and BE isoforms are missing so far. Here, we present data from in vitro studies including both interaction of leaf derived and heterologously expressed SS and BE isoforms. We found that SSI activity in native PAGE without addition of glucans was dependent on at least one of the two BE isoforms active in Arabidopsis leaves. This interaction is most likely not based on a physical association of the enzymes, as demonstrated by immunodetection and native PAGE mobility analysis of SSI, BE2, and BE3. The glucans formed by the action of SSI/BEs were analysed using leaf protein extracts from wild type and be single mutants (Atbe2 and Atbe3 mutant lines) and by different combinations of recombinant proteins. Chain length distribution (CLD) patterns of the formed glucans were irrespective of SSI and BE isoforms origin and still independent of assay conditions. Furthermore, we show that all SS isoforms (SSI-SSIV) were able to interact with BEs and form branched glucans. However, only SSI/BEs generated a polymodal distribution of glucans which was similar to CLD pattern detected in amylopectin of Arabidopsis leaf starch. We discuss the impact of the SSI/BEs interplay for the CLD pattern of amylopectin."
https://openalex.org/W2092247923,"β-Arrestins are signaling adaptors that bind to agonist-occupied G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) and target them for endocytosis; however, the mechanisms regulating receptor/β-arrestin complexes and trafficking in endosomes, remain ill defined. Here we show, in live cells, differential dynamic regulation of endosomal bradykinin B2 receptor (B2R) complexes with either β-arrestin-1 or -2. We find a novel role for MAPK in the B2R/β-arrestin-2 complex formation, receptor trafficking and signaling mediated by an ERK1/2 regulatory motif in the hinge domain of the rat β-arrestin-2 (PET(178)P), but not rat β-arrestin-1 (PER(177)P). While the ERK1/2 regulatory motif is conserved between rat and mouse β-arrestin-2, it is surprisingly not conserved in human β-arrestin-2 (PEK(178)P). However, mutation of lysine 178 to threonine is sufficient to confer MAPK sensitivity to the human β-arrestin-2. Furthermore, substitution for a phosphomimetic residue in both the rat and the human β-arrestin-2 (T/K178D) significantly stabilizes B2R/β-arrestin complexes in endosomes, delays receptor recycling to the plasma membrane and maintains intracellular MAPK signaling. Similarly, the endosomal trafficking of β2-adrenergic, angiotensin II type 1 and vasopressin V2 receptors was altered by the β-arrestin-2 T178D mutant. Our findings unveil a novel subtype specific mode of MAPK-dependent regulation of β-arrestins in intracellular trafficking and signaling of GPCRs, and suggest differential endosomal receptor/β-arrestin-2 signaling roles among species."
https://openalex.org/W1988838278,"It has been shown that modestly increasing plasma membrane cholesterol beyond its physiological set point greatly increases the endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondrial pools, thereby eliciting manifold feedback responses that return cell cholesterol to its resting state. The question arises whether this homeostatic mechanism reflects the targeting of cell surface cholesterol to specific intracellular sites or its general equilibration among the organelles. We now show that human fibroblast cholesterol can be increased as much as two-fold from 2-hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin without changing the size of the cell surface pool. Rather, essentially all of the added cholesterol disperses rapidly among cytoplasmic membranes, increasing their overall cholesterol content by as much as five-fold. We conclude that the level of plasma membrane cholesterol is normally at capacity and that even small increments above this physiological set point redistribute essentially entirely to intracellular membranes, perhaps down their chemical activity gradients."
https://openalex.org/W2067172750,"The musician's brain is considered as a good model of brain plasticity as musical training is known to modify auditory perception and related cortical organization. Here, we show that music-related modifications can also extend beyond motor and auditory processing and generalize (transfer) to speech processing. Previous studies have shown that adults and newborns can segment a continuous stream of linguistic and non-linguistic stimuli based only on probabilities of occurrence between adjacent syllables, tones or timbres. The paradigm classically used in these studies consists of a passive exposure phase followed by a testing phase. By using both behavioural and electrophysiological measures, we recently showed that adult musicians and musically trained children outperform nonmusicians in the test following brief exposure to an artificial sung language. However, the behavioural test does not allow for studying the learning process per se but rather the result of the learning. In the present study, we analyze the electrophysiological learning curves that are the ongoing brain dynamics recorded as the learning is taking place. While musicians show an inverted U shaped learning curve, nonmusicians show a linear learning curve. Analyses of Event-Related Potentials (ERPs) allow for a greater understanding of how and when musical training can improve speech segmentation. These results bring evidence of enhanced neural sensitivity to statistical regularities in musicians and support the hypothesis of positive transfer of training effect from music to sound stream segmentation in general."
https://openalex.org/W2003294077,"Hypoxia alters cellular metabolism and although the effects of sustained hypoxia (SH) have been extensively studied, less is known about chronic intermittent hypoxia (IH), commonly associated with cardiovascular morbidity and stroke. We hypothesize that impaired glutamate homeostasis after chronic IH may underlie vulnerability to stroke-induced excitotoxicity. P16 organotypic hippocampal slices, cultured for 7 days were exposed for 7 days to IH (alternating 2 min 5% O2-15 min 21% O2), SH (5% O2) or RA (21% O2), then 3 glutamate challenges. The first and last exposures were intended as a metabolic stimulus (200 µM glutamate, 15 min); the second emulated excitotoxicity (10 mM glutamate, 10 min). GFAP, MAP2, and EAAT1, EAAT2 glutamate transporters expression were assessed after exposure to each hypoxic protocol. Additionally, cell viability was determined at baseline and after each glutamate challenge, in presence or absence of ceftriaxone that increases glutamate transporter expression. GFAP and MAP2 decreased after 7 days IH and SH. Long-term IH but not SH decreased EAAT1 and EAAT2. Excitotoxic glutamate challenge decreased cell viability and the following 200 µM exposure further increased cell death, particularly in IH-exposed slices. Ceftriaxone prevented glutamate transporter decrease and improved cell viability after IH and excitotoxicity. We conclude that IH is more detrimental to cell survival and glutamate homeostasis than SH. These findings suggest that impaired regulation of extracellular glutamate levels is implicated in the increased brain susceptibility to excitotoxic insult after long-term IH."

Subjects 12,189 patients aged 16 years or over diagnosed with colorectal cancer (CRC), 11,081 patients with lung cancer and 4,352 patients with malignant melanoma, with first record of cancer diagnosis during 1997–2006. Main outcome measures Cancer cases recorded in primary care; probability of survival following diagnosis; and number of GP contacts within the 24 months preceding diagnosis. Results From 1997–2006, overall rates of GP recorded CRC and lung cancer cases recorded were higher in men than in women, but rates of malignant melanoma were higher in women than in men. Gender differences in survival were small; 49% of men and 53% of women survived at least 5 years following CRC diagnosis; 9% of men and 12% of women with lung cancer, and 77% of men and 86% of women with malignant melanoma. The adjusted male to female relative hazard ratio of death in all patients was 1.20 (95%CI 1.13–1.30), 1.24 (95%CI 1.16–1.33) and 1.73 (95%CI 1.51–2.00) for CRC, lung cancer and malignant melanoma respectively. However, gender differences in the relative risk were much smaller amongst those who died during follow-up. For each cancer, there was little evidence of gender difference in the percentage who consulted and the number of GP contacts made within 24 months prior to diagnosis. Conclusions This study found that patterns of consulting prior to cancer diagnosis differed little between two genders, providing no support for the hypothesis that gender differences in survival are explained by gender differences in consultation for more serious illness, and suggests the need for a more critical view of gender and consultation."
https://openalex.org/W2049065975,"Increasingly, anti-cancer medications are being reported to induce cell death mechanisms other than apoptosis. Activating alternate death mechanisms introduces the potential to kill cells that have defects in their apoptotic machinery, as is commonly observed in cancer cells, including in hematological malignancies. We, and others, have previously reported that the mTOR inhibitor everolimus has pre-clinical efficacy and induces caspase-independent cell death in acute lymphoblastic leukemia cells. Furthermore, everolimus is currently in clinical trial for acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Here we characterize the death mechanism activated by everolimus in acute lymphoblastic leukemia cells. We find that cell death is caspase-independent and lacks the morphology associated with apoptosis. Although mitochondrial depolarization is an early event, permeabilization of the outer mitochondrial membrane only occurs after cell death has occurred. While morphological and biochemical evidence shows that autophagy is clearly present it is not responsible for the observed cell death. There are a number of features consistent with paraptosis including morphology, caspase-independence, and the requirement for new protein synthesis. However in contrast to some reports of paraptosis, the activation of JNK signaling was not required for everolimus-induced cell death. Overall in acute lymphoblastic leukemia cells everolimus induces a cell death that resembles paraptosis."
https://openalex.org/W2083751740,"Spontaneously hypertensive rat (SHR) is a suitable model for studies of the complications of hypertension. It is known that activation of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase enzyme (PARP) plays an important role in the development of postinfarction as well as long-term hypertension induced heart failure. In this study, we examined whether PARP-inhibitor (L-2286) treatment could prevent the development of hypertensive cardiopathy in SHRs. 6-week-old SHR animals were treated with L-2286 (SHR-L group) or placebo (SHR-C group) for 24 weeks. Wistar-Kyoto rats were used as aged-matched, normotensive controls (WKY group). Echocardiography was performed, brain-derived natriuretic peptide (BNP) activity and blood pressure were determined at the end of the study. We detected the extent of fibrotic areas. The amount of heat-shock proteins (Hsps) and the phosphorylation state of Akt-1(Ser473), glycogen synthase kinase (GSK)-3β(Ser9), forkhead transcription factor (FKHR)(Ser256), mitogen activated protein kinases (MAPKs), and protein kinase C (PKC) isoenzymes were monitored. The elevated blood pressure in SHRs was not influenced by PARP-inhibitor treatment. Systolic left ventricular function and BNP activity did not differ among the three groups. L-2286 treatment decreased the marked left ventricular (LV) hypertrophy which was developed in SHRs. Interstitial collagen deposition was also decreased by L-2286 treatment. The phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)1/2(Thr183-Tyr185), Akt-1(Ser473), GSK-3β(Ser9), FKHR(Ser256), and PKC ε(Ser729) and the level of Hsp90 were increased, while the activity of PKC α/βII(Thr638/641), ζ/λ(410/403) were mitigated by L-2286 administration. We could detect signs of LV hypertrophy without congestive heart failure in SHR groups. This alteration was prevented by PARP inhibition. Our results suggest that PARP-inhibitor treatment has protective effect already in the early stage of hypertensive myocardial remodeling."
https://openalex.org/W2004008540,"We apply a novel gene expression network analysis to a cohort of 182 recently reported candidate Epileptic Encephalopathy genes to identify those most likely to be true Epileptic Encephalopathy genes. These candidate genes were identified as having single variants of likely pathogenic significance discovered in a large-scale massively parallel sequencing study. Candidate Epileptic Encephalopathy genes were prioritized according to their co-expression with 29 known Epileptic Encephalopathy genes. We utilized developing brain and adult brain gene expression data from the Allen Human Brain Atlas (AHBA) and compared this to data from Celsius: a large, heterogeneous gene expression data warehouse. We show replicable prioritization results using these three independent gene expression resources, two of which are brain-specific, with small sample size, and the third derived from a heterogeneous collection of tissues with large sample size. Of the nineteen genes that we predicted with the highest likelihood to be true Epileptic Encephalopathy genes, two (GNAO1 and GRIN2B) have recently been independently reported and confirmed. We compare our results to those produced by an established in silico prioritization approach called Endeavour, and finally present gene expression networks for the known and candidate Epileptic Encephalopathy genes. This highlights sub-networks of gene expression, particularly in the network derived from the adult AHBA gene expression dataset. These networks give clues to the likely biological interactions between Epileptic Encephalopathy genes, potentially highlighting underlying mechanisms and avenues for therapeutic targets."
https://openalex.org/W2050519562,"Repeated stress can trigger a range of psychiatric disorders, including anxiety. The propensity to develop abnormal behaviors after repeated stress is related to the severity, frequency and number of stressors. However, the pattern of stress exposure may contribute to the impact of stress. In addition, the anxiogenic nature of repeated stress exposure can be moderated by the degree of coping that occurs, and can be reflected in homotypic habituation to the repeated stress. However, expectations are not clear when a pattern of stress presentation is utilized that diminishes habituation. The purpose of these experiments is to test whether interrupted stress exposure decreases homotypic habituation and leads to greater effects on anxiety-like behavior in adult male rats. We found that repeated interrupted restraint stress resulted in less overall homotypic habituation compared to repeated daily restraint stress. This was demonstrated by greater production of fecal boli and greater corticosterone response to restraint. Furthermore, interrupted restraint stress resulted in a lower body weight and greater adrenal gland weight than daily restraint stress, and greater anxiety-like behavior in the elevated plus maze. Control experiments demonstrated that these effects of the interrupted pattern could not be explained by differences in the total number of stress exposures, differences in the total number of days that the stress periods encompased, nor could it be explained as a result of only the stress exposures after an interruption from stress. These experiments demonstrate that the pattern of stress exposure is a significant determinant of the effects of repeated stress, and that interrupted stress exposure that decreases habituation can have larger effects than a greater number of daily stress exposures. Differences in the pattern of stress exposure are therefore an important factor to consider when predicting the severity of the effects of repeated stress on psychiatric disorders."

Its structure was well elucidated, by a combined utilization of chemical and spectroscopic techniques, to be a β-glucan with a backbone of (1→4)- and (1→6)-Glcp, bearing terminal- and (1→3)-Glcp side-chains at O-3 position of (1→6)-Glcp. Immunological assay exhibited that GSP-2 significantly induced the proliferation of BALB/c mice splenocytes with target on only B cells, and enhanced the production of several cytokines in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells and derived dendritic cells.

https://openalex.org/W2007574789,"Mild cold acclimation is known to increase brown adipose tissue (BAT) activity and cold-induced thermogenesis (CIT) in humans. We here tested the effect of a lifestyle with frequent exposure to extreme cold on BAT and CIT in a Dutch man known as 'the Iceman', who has multiple world records in withstanding extreme cold challenges. Furthermore, his monozygotic twin brother who has a 'normal' sedentary lifestyle without extreme cold exposures was measured.The Iceman (subject A) and his brother (subject B) were studied during mild cold (13°C) and thermoneutral conditions (31°C). Measurements included BAT activity and respiratory muscle activity by [18F]FDG-PET/CT imaging and energy expenditure through indirect calorimetry. In addition, body temperatures, cardiovascular parameters, skin perfusion, and thermal sensation and comfort were measured. Finally, we determined polymorphisms for uncoupling protein-1 and β3-adrenergic receptor.Subjects had comparable BAT activity (A: 1144 SUVtotal and B: 1325 SUVtotal), within the range previously observed in young adult men. They were genotyped with the polymorphism for uncoupling protein-1 (G/G). CIT was relatively high (A: 40.1% and B: 41.9%), but unlike during our previous cold exposure tests in young adult men, here both subjects practiced a g-Tummo like breathing technique, which involves vigorous respiratory muscle activity. This was confirmed by high [18F]FDG-uptake in respiratory muscle.No significant differences were found between the two subjects, indicating that a lifestyle with frequent exposures to extreme cold does not seem to affect BAT activity and CIT. In both subjects, BAT was not higher compared to earlier observations, whereas CIT was very high, suggesting that g-Tummo like breathing during cold exposure may cause additional heat production by vigorous isometric respiratory muscle contraction. The results must be interpreted with caution given the low subject number and the fact that both participants practised the g-Tummo like breathing technique."
https://openalex.org/W2067880943,"In recent years, a significant amount of sequence data (both genomic and transcriptomic) for Echinococcus spp. has been published, thereby facilitating the analysis of genes expressed during a specific stage or involved in parasite development. To perform a suitable gene expression quantification analysis, the use of validated reference genes is strongly recommended. Thus, the aim of this work was to identify suitable reference genes to allow reliable expression normalization for genes of interest in Echinococcus granulosus sensu stricto (s.s.) (G1) and Echinococcus ortleppi upon induction of the early pre-adult development. Untreated protoscoleces (PS) and pepsin-treated protoscoleces (PSP) from E. granulosus s.s. (G1) and E. ortleppi metacestode were used. The gene expression stability of eleven candidate reference genes (βTUB, NDUFV2, RPL13, TBP, CYP-1, RPII, EF-1α, βACT-1, GAPDH, ETIF4A-III and MAPK3) was assessed using geNorm, Normfinder, and RefFinder. Our qPCR data showed a good correlation with the recently published RNA-seq data. Regarding expression stability, EF-1α and TBP were the most stable genes for both species. Interestingly, βACT-1 (the most commonly used reference gene), and GAPDH and ETIF4A-III (previously identified as housekeeping genes) did not behave stably in our assay conditions. We propose the use of EF-1α as a reference gene for studies involving gene expression analysis in both PS and PSP experimental conditions for E. granulosus s.s. and E. ortleppi. To demonstrate its applicability, EF-1α was used as a normalizer gene in the relative quantification of transcripts from genes coding for antigen B subunits. The same EF-1α reference gene may be used in studies with other Echinococcus sensu lato species. This report validates suitable reference genes for species of class Cestoda, phylum Platyhelminthes, thus providing a foundation for further validation in other epidemiologically important cestode species, such as those from the Taenia genus."

The preservation of the proton motif force was attributed to (i) cation exclusion, (ii) engulfment of the nascent chain by the hydrophobic pore ring, and (iii) a half-helix partly plugging the channel. In contrast, we show here that preservation of the proton motif force is due to a voltage-driven conformational change. Preprotein or signal peptide binding to the purified and reconstituted SecYEG results in large cation and anion conductivities only when the membrane potential is small. Physiological values of membrane potential close the activated channel. This voltage-dependent closure is not dependent on the presence of the plug domain and is not affected by mutation of 3 of the 6 constriction residues to glycines.

https://openalex.org/W2020012750,"Nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) is a head and neck malignant tumor rare throughout most of the world but common in Southeast Asia, especially in Southern China. Flotillin-2 (Flot-2) is not only an important component of cellular membrane, but also involves in various cellular processes such as membrane trafficking, T cell and B cell activation, regulation of several signaling pathways associated with cell growth and malignant transformation, keeping structure and junction of epidermal cells and formation of filopodia. Although such molecular effects of Flot-2 have been reported, whether the expression of Flot-2 protein is associated with clinicopathologic implication for NPC has not been reported. The purpose of this research is to investigate the expression of Flot-2 protein in NPC and control nasopharyngeal epithelial tissues by immunohistochemistry and elucidate the association between the expression of Flot-2 protein and clinicopathological characteristics of NPC. The results showed that the positive percentage of Flot-2 expression in the NPC, nasopharyngeal epithelia with atypical hyperplasia and in the control nasopharyngeal mucosa epithelia was 88.8% (119/134), 76.9% (10/13) and 5.7% (5/88), respectively. There was significantly higher expression of Flot-2 protein in NPC and nasopharyngeal epithelia with atypical hyperplasia compared to the control nasopharyngeal mucosa epithelia (P<0.001, respectively). The positive percentage of Flot-2 protein expression in NPC patients with lymph node metastasis was significantly higher than those without lymph node metastasis. Increasing of Flot-2 expression was obviously correlated with clinical stages of NPC patients. The expression of Flot-2 was proved to be the independent predicted factor for lymph node metastasis by multivariate analysis. The sensitivity of Flot-2 for predicting lymph node metastasis of NPC patients was 93%. Taken together, our results suggest that the increased expression of Flot-2 protein is a novel higher sensitivity biomarker that can predict lymph node metastases in NPC."
https://openalex.org/W2028808179,"The influence of functional group specific production and respiration patterns on a lake's metabolic balance remains poorly investigated to date compared to whole-system estimates of metabolism. We employed a summed component ecosystem approach for assessing lake-wide and functional group-specific metabolism (gross primary production (GPP) and respiration (R)) in shallow and eutrophic Lake Võrtsjärv in central Estonia during three years. Eleven functional groups were considered: piscivorous and benthivorous fish; phyto-, bacterio-, proto- and metazooplankton; benthic macroinvertebrates, bacteria and ciliates; macrophytes and their associated epiphytes. Metabolism of these groups was assessed by allometric equations coupled with daily records of temperature and hydrology of the lake and measurements of food web functional groups biomass. Results revealed that heterotrophy dominated most of the year, with a short autotrophic period observed in late spring. Most of the metabolism of the lake could be attributed to planktonic functional groups, with phytoplankton contributing the highest share (90% of GPP and 43% of R). A surge of protozooplankton and bacterioplankton populations forming the microbial loop caused the shift from auto- to heterotrophy in midsummer. Conversely, the benthic functional groups had overall a very small contribution to lake metabolism. We validated our ecosystem approach by comparing the GPP and R with those calculated from O2 measurements in the lake. Our findings are also in line with earlier productivity studies made with 14C or chlorophyll a (chl-a) based equations. Ideally, the ecosystem approach should be combined with diel O2 approach for investigating critical periods of metabolism shifts caused by dynamics in food-web processes."
https://openalex.org/W2078594596,"Cardiac hypertrophy increases the risk of morbidity and mortality of cardiovascular disease and thus inhibiting such hypertrophy is beneficial. In the present study, we explored the effect of a bioactive peptide (PAP) on angiotensin II (Ang II)-induced hypertrophy and associated ventricular arrhythmias in in vitro and in vivo models. PAP enhances p21 activated kinase 1 (Pak1) activity by increasing the level of phosphorylated Pak1 in cultured neonatal rat ventricular myocytes (NRVMs). Such PAP-induced Pak1 activation is associated with a significant reduction of Ang II-induced hypertrophy in NRVMs and C57BL/6 mice, in vitro and in vivo, respectively. Furthermore, PAP antagonizes ventricular arrhythmias associated with Ang II-induced hypertrophy in mice. Its antiarrhythmic effect is likely to be involved in multiple mechanisms to affect both substrate and trigger of ventricular arrhythmogenesis. Thus our results suggest that Pak1 activation achieved by specific bioactive peptide represents a potential novel therapeutic strategy for cardiac hypertrophy and associated ventricular arrhythmias."
https://openalex.org/W1984877171,"Previous research has shown that human infants and young children are sensitive to the boundaries of certain social groups, which supports the idea that the capacity to represent social categories constitutes a fundamental characteristic of the human cognitive system. However, the function this capacity serves is still debated. We propose that during social categorization the human mind aims at mapping out social groups defined by a certain set of shared knowledge. An eye-tracking paradigm was designed to test whether two-year-old children differentially associate conventional versus non-conventional tool use with language-use, reflecting an organization of information that is induced by cues of shared knowledge. Children first watched videos depicting a male model perform goal-directed actions either in a conventional or in a non-conventional way. In the test phase children were presented with photographs taken of the model and of a similarly aged unfamiliar person while listening to a foreign (Experiment 1) or a native language (Experiment 2) text. Upon hearing the foreign utterance children looked at the model first if he had been seen to act in an unconventional way during familiarization. In contrast, children looked at the other person if the model had performed conventional tool use actions. No such differences were found in case of the native language. The results suggest that children take the conventionality of behavior into account in forming representations about a person, and they generalize to other qualities of the person based on this information."
https://openalex.org/W1986126326,"Objective Considering the high number of stressors encountered in the context of elite sports, a high sense of coherence (SOC) is crucial to allow athletes to maintain their health from both short- and long-term perspectives. The aim of this cross-sectional study was to investigate SOC in a population of elite athletes, focusing on identification of subsets of athletes with particularly high and low SOC scores, and any related predictors. The elite athletes' SOC scores were also evaluated for differences with those of the general population of Germany; whether a correlation between SOC and subjective health existed was additionally examined. Method In total, 698 male and female elite athletes, drawn from Germany's highest-level national track and field squads, and first and second division handball teams, completed a survey that included the SOC-L9 Scale and measures of subjective health, sociodemographic information, and the number of injury lay-offs experienced during the athletes' careers to date. Results Classification tree analysis reveals six contrast groups with varying SOC scores. Several interacting factors determine the group to which an athlete belongs. Together with overuse injuries, additional factors are age, gender, and completed/not completed apprenticeship/degree. Female athletes aged between 19 and 25, who had already been subject to lay-offs due to overuse injuries, comprise the group with the lowest SOC scores. Overall, the SOC of elite athletes is slightly lower than in the general population. In accordance with other studies, a stronger SOC is also correlated significantly with better global subjective health. Conclusion The identification of contrast groups with varying SOC scores contributes to the development of more targeted salutogenetic health promotion programs. Such programs would ideally include learning modules pertaining to coping with overuse injuries, as well as social support systems aiming to effectively combine education and elite sport."
https://openalex.org/W2028709471,"Plasma membrane Ca2+-ATPase (PMCA) by extruding Ca2+ outside the cell, actively participates in the regulation of intracellular Ca2+ concentration. Acting as Ca2+/H+ counter-transporter, PMCA transports large quantities of protons which may affect organellar pH homeostasis. PMCA exists in four isoforms (PMCA1-4) but only PMCA2 and PMCA3, due to their unique localization and features, perform more specialized function. Using differentiated PC12 cells we assessed the role of PMCA2 and PMCA3 in the regulation of intracellular pH in steady-state conditions and during Ca2+ overload evoked by 59 mM KCl. We observed that manipulation in PMCA expression elevated pHmito and pHcyto but only in PMCA2-downregulated cells higher mitochondrial pH gradient (ΔpH) was found in steady-state conditions. Our data also demonstrated that PMCA2 or PMCA3 knock-down delayed Ca2+ clearance and partially attenuated cellular acidification during KCl-stimulated Ca2+ influx. Because SERCA and NCX modulated cellular pH response in neglectable manner, and all conditions used to inhibit PMCA prevented KCl-induced pH drop, we considered PMCA2 and PMCA3 as mainly responsible for transport of protons to intracellular milieu. In steady-state conditions, higher TMRE uptake in PMCA2-knockdown line was driven by plasma membrane potential (Ψp). Nonetheless, mitochondrial membrane potential (Ψm) in this line was dissipated during Ca2+ overload. Cyclosporin and bongkrekic acid prevented Ψm loss suggesting the involvement of Ca2+-driven opening of mitochondrial permeability transition pore as putative underlying mechanism. The findings presented here demonstrate a crucial role of PMCA2 and PMCA3 in regulation of cellular pH and indicate PMCA membrane composition important for preservation of electrochemical gradient."
https://openalex.org/W2000036784,"Group I introns are pre-mRNA introns that do not require the spliceosome for their removal. Instead, they fold into complex three-dimensional structures and catalyze two transesterification reactions, thereby excising themselves and joining the flanking exons. These catalytic RNAs (ribozymes) have been modified previously to work in trans, whereby the ribozymes can recognize a splice site on a substrate RNA and replace the 5'- or 3'-portion of the substrate. Here we describe a new variant of the group I intron ribozyme from Tetrahymena that recognizes two splice sites on a substrate RNA, removes the intron sequences between the splice sites, and joins the flanking exons, analogous to the action of the spliceosome. This 'group I spliceozyme' functions in vitro and in vivo, and it is able to mediate a growth phenotype in E. coli cells. The intron sequences of the target pre-mRNAs are constrained near the splice sites but can carry a wide range of sequences in their interior. Because the splice site recognition sequences can be adjusted to different splice sites, the spliceozyme may have the potential for wide applications as tool in research and therapy."
https://openalex.org/W2043557984,"Single-molecule experiments indicate that integrin affinity is cation-type-dependent, but in spread cells integrins are engaged in complex focal adhesions (FAs), which can also regulate affinity. To better understand cation-type-dependent adhesion in fully spread cells, we investigated attachment strength by application of external shear. While cell attachment strength is indeed modulated by cations, the regulation of integrin-mediated adhesion is also exceedingly complex, cell specific, and niche dependent. In the presence of magnesium only, fibroblasts and fibrosarcoma cells remodel their cytoskeleton to align in the direction of applied shear in an α5-integrin/fibronectin-dependent manner, which allows them to withstand higher shear. In the presence of calcium or on collagen in modest shear, fibroblasts undergo piecewise detachment but fibrosarcoma cells exhibit increased attachment strength. These data augment the current understanding of force-mediated detachment by suggesting a dynamic interplay in situ between cell adhesion and integrins depending on local niche cation conditions."
https://openalex.org/W2032755746,"By consuming mulberry leaves covered with pollen from nearby genetically engineered, insect-resistant rice lines producing Cry proteins derived from Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt), larvae of the domestic silkworm, Bombyx mori (Linnaeus) (Lepidoptera: Bombyxidae), could be exposed to insecticidal proteins. Laboratory experiments were conducted to assess the potential effects of Cry1C- or Cry2A-producing transgenic rice (T1C-19, T2A-1) pollen on B. mori fitness. In a short-term assay, B. mori larvae were fed mulberry leaves covered with different densities of pollen from Bt rice lines or their corresponding near isoline (control) for the first 3 d and then were fed mulberry leaves without pollen. No effect was detected on any life table parameter, even at 1800 pollen grains/cm2 leaf, which is much higher than the mean natural density of rice pollen on leaves of mulberry trees near paddy fields. In a long-term assay, the larvae were fed Bt and control pollen in the same way but for their entire larval stage (approximately 27 d). Bt pollen densities ≥150 grains/cm2 leaf reduced 14-d larval weight, increased larval development time, and reduced adult eclosion rate. ELISA analyses showed that 72.6% of the Cry protein was still detected in the pollen grains excreted with the feces. The low exposure of silkworm larvae to Cry proteins when feeding Bt rice pollen may be the explanation for the relatively low toxicity detected in the current study. Although the results demonstrate that B. mori larvae are sensitive to Cry1C and Cry2A proteins, the exposure levels that harmed the larvae in the current study are far greater than natural exposure levels. We therefore conclude that consumption of Bt rice pollen will pose a low to negligible risk to B. mori."
https://openalex.org/W2130955533,"Small Rho GTPases are well known to regulate a variety of cellular processes by acting as molecular switches. The regulatory function of Rho GTPases is critically dependent on their posttranslational modification at the carboxyl terminus by isoprenylation and association with proper cellular membranes. Despite numerous studies, the mechanisms of recycling and functional integration of Rho GTPases at the biological membranes are largely unclear. In this study, prenylated human Rac1, a prominent member of the Rho family, was purified in large amount from baculovirus-infected Spodoptera frugiperda insect cells using a systematic detergent screening. In contrast to non-prenylated human Rac1 purified from Escherichia coli, prenylated Rac1 from insect cells was able to associate with synthetic liposomes and to bind Rho-specific guanine nucleotide dissociation inhibitor 1 (GDI1). Subsequent liposome reconstitution experiments revealed that GDI1 efficiently extracts Rac1 from liposomes preferentially in the inactive GDP-bound state. The extraction was prevented when Rac1 was activated to its GTP-bound state by Rac-specific guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs), such as Vav2, Dbl, Tiam1, P-Rex1 and TrioN, and bound by the downstream effector Pak1. We found that dissociation of Rac1-GDP from its complex with GDI1 strongly correlated with two distinct activities of especially Dbl and Tiam1, including liposome association and the GDP/GTP exchange. Taken together, our results provided first detailed insights into the advantages of the in vitro liposome-based reconstitution system to study both the integration of the signal transducing protein complexes and the mechanisms of regulation and signaling of small GTPases at biological membranes."
https://openalex.org/W2064842985,"Background Fibulin-1, a circulating extracellular matrix glycoprotein, has been associated with arterial disease and elevated N-terminal prohormone B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) in diabetes. Soluble urokinase plasminogen activator receptor (suPAR), a marker of inflammation, has been associated with subclinical atherosclerosis. Therefore, we aimed to explore the interplay between these biomarkers and mild to moderate aortic valve stenosis (AS). Methods In 374 patients with mild to moderate AS, we investigated the relationship of fibulin-1 with NT-proBNP, levels of suPAR and the degree of AS at baseline and after one and four years of treatment with Simvastatin 40 mg and Ezetimibe 10 mg or placebo. Results During treatment, fibulin-1 became more closely associated with NT-proBNP (βyear0 = 0.10, p = 0.08, βyear1 = 0.16, p = 0.005, βyear4 = 0.22, p<0.001) and suPAR (βyear0 = 0.05, p = 0.34, βyear1 = 0.16, p = 0.006, βyear4 = 0.13, p = 0.03) at the expense of the association to aortic valve area index (AVAI) (βyear0 = −0.14, p = 0.005, βyear1 = −0.08, p = 0.11, βyear4 = −0.06, p = 0.22) independently of age, gender, creatinine, and serum aspartate aminotransferase (Adj.Ryear02 = 0.19, Adj.Ryear12 = 0.22, Adj.Ryear42 = 0.27). Fibulin-1 was unrelated to aortic regurgitation, left ventricular mass, and ejection fraction. In patients with baseline AVAI<0.58 cm2/m2 (median value), fibulin-1 was more closely associated to NT-proBNP (βyear0 = 0.25, βyear1 = 0.21, βyear4 = 0.22, all p<0.01), and suPAR (βyear0 = 0.09, p = 0.26, βyear1 = 0.23, βyear4 = 0.21, both p<0.01) independently of age, gender, AST and treatment allocation. Conclusions Increased levels of fibulin-1 were independently associated with higher levels of suPAR and NT-proBNP especially in patients with lower AVAI, suggesting that fibulin-1 may be an early marker of AS as well as cardiac fibrosis secondarily to elevated left ventricular hemodynamic load."
https://openalex.org/W2020262819,"Introduction The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has recommended using a nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT) for diagnosing pulmonary tuberculosis (TB) but there is a lack of data on NAAT cost-effectiveness. Methods We conducted a prospective cohort study that included all patients with an AFB smear-positive respiratory specimen at Grady Memorial Hospital in Atlanta, GA, USA between January 2002 and June 2008. We determined the sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive value of a commercially available and FDA-approved NAAT (amplified MTD, Gen-Probe) compared to the gold standard of culture. A cost analysis was performed and included costs related to laboratory tests, hospital charges, anti-TB medications, and contact investigations. Average cost per patient was calculated under two conditions: (1) using a NAAT on all AFB smear-postive respiratory specimens and (2) not using a NAAT. One-way sensitivity analyses were conducted to determine sensitivity of cost difference to reasonable ranges of model inputs. Results During a 6 1/2 year study period, there were 1,009 patients with an AFB smear-positive respiratory specimen at our public urban hospital. We found the NAAT to be highly sensitive (99.6%) and specific (99.1%) on AFB smear-positive specimens compared to culture. Overall, the positive predictive value (PPV) of an AFB smear-positive respiratory specimen for culture-confirmed TB was 27%. The PPV of an AFB smear-positive respiratory specimen for culture-confirmed TB was significantly higher for HIV-uninfected persons compared to those who were HIV-seropositive (152/271 [56%] vs. 85/445 [19%]; RR = 2.94, 95% CI 2.36–3.65, p<0.001). The cost savings of using the NAAT was $2,003 per AFB smear-positive case. Conclusions Routine use of the NAAT on AFB smear-positive respiratory specimens was highly cost-saving in our setting at a U.S. urban public hospital with a high prevalence of TB and HIV because of the low PPV of an AFB smear for culture-confirmed TB."
https://openalex.org/W2082456688,"The objectives of this study were to assess whether current surveillance capacity is sufficient to fulfill EU and Danish regulations to control a hypothetical foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) epidemic in Denmark, and whether enlarging the protection and/or surveillance zones could minimize economic losses. The stochastic spatial simulation model DTU-DADS was further developed to simulate clinical surveillance of herds within the protection and surveillance zones and used to model spread of FMD between herds. A queuing system was included in the model, and based on daily surveillance capacity, which was 450 herds per day, it was decided whether herds appointed for surveillance would be surveyed on the current day or added to the queue. The model was run with a basic scenario representing the EU and Danish regulations, which includes a 3 km protection and 10 km surveillance zone around detected herds. In alternative scenarios, the protection zone was enlarged to 5 km, the surveillance zone was enlarged to 15 or 20 km, or a combined enlargement of the protection and surveillance zones was modelled. Sensitivity analysis included changing surveillance capacity to 200, 350 or 600 herds per day, frequency of repeated visits for herds in overlapping surveillance zones from every 14 days to every 7, 21 and 30 days, and the size of the zones combined with a surveillance capacity increased to 600 herds per day. The results showed that the default surveillance capacity is sufficient to survey herds on time. Extra resources for surveillance did not improve the situation, but fewer resources could result in larger epidemics and costs. Enlarging the protection zone was a better strategy than the basic scenario. Despite that enlarging the surveillance zone might result in shorter epidemic duration, and lower number of affected herds, it resulted frequently in larger economic losses."
https://openalex.org/W1971292061,"N-cadherin is a cell-cell adhesion molecule and deletion of N-cadherin in mice is embryonic lethal. During the secretory stage of enamel development, E-cadherin is down-regulated and N-cadherin is specifically up-regulated in ameloblasts when groups of ameloblasts slide by one another to form the rodent decussating enamel rod pattern. Since N-cadherin promotes cell migration, we asked if N-cadherin is essential for ameloblast cell movement during enamel development.The enamel organ, including its ameloblasts, is an epithelial tissue and for this study a mouse strain with N-cadherin ablated from epithelium was generated. Enamel from wild-type (WT) and N-cadherin conditional knockout (cKO) mice was analyzed. μCT and scanning electron microscopy showed that thickness, surface structure, and prism pattern of the cKO enamel looked identical to WT. No significant difference in hardness was observed between WT and cKO enamel. Interestingly, immunohistochemistry revealed the WT and N-cadherin cKO secretory stage ameloblasts expressed approximately equal amounts of total cadherins. Strikingly, E-cadherin was not normally down-regulated during the secretory stage in the cKO mice suggesting that E-cadherin can compensate for the loss of N-cadherin. Previously it was demonstrated that bone morphogenetic protein-2 (BMP2) induces E- and N-cadherin expression in human calvaria osteoblasts and we show that the N-cadherin cKO enamel organ expressed significantly more BMP2 and significantly less of the BMP antagonist Noggin than did WT enamel organ.The E- to N-cadherin switch at the secretory stage is not essential for enamel development or for forming the decussating enamel rod pattern. E-cadherin can substitute for N-cadherin during these developmental processes. Bmp2 expression may compensate for the loss of N-cadherin by inducing or maintaining E-cadherin expression when E-cadherin is normally down-regulated. Notably, this is the first demonstration of a natural endogenous increase in E-cadherin expression due to N-cadherin ablation in a healthy developing tissue."
https://openalex.org/W2003178430,"Environmentally acquired beneficial associations are comprised of a wide variety of symbiotic species that vary both genetically and phenotypically, and therefore have differential colonization abilities, even when symbionts are of the same species. Strain variation is common among conspecific hosts, where subtle differences can lead to competitive exclusion between closely related strains. One example where symbiont specificity is observed is in the sepiolid squid-Vibrio mutualism, where competitive dominance exists among V. fischeri isolates due to subtle genetic differences between strains. Although key symbiotic loci are responsible for the establishment of this association, the genetic mechanisms that dictate strain specificity are not fully understood. We examined several symbiotic loci (lux-bioluminescence, pil = pili, and msh-mannose sensitive hemagglutinin) from mutualistic V. fischeri strains isolated from two geographically distinct squid host species (Euprymna tasmanica-Australia and E. scolopes-Hawaii) to determine whether slight genetic differences regulated host specificity. Through colonization studies performed in naïve squid hatchlings from both hosts, we found that all loci examined are important for specificity and host recognition. Complementation of null mutations in non-native V. fischeri with loci from the native V. fischeri caused a gain in fitness, resulting in competitive dominance in the non-native host. The competitive ability of these symbiotic loci depended upon the locus tested and the specific squid species in which colonization was measured. Our results demonstrate that multiple bacterial genetic elements can determine V. fischeri strain specificity between two closely related squid hosts, indicating how important genetic variation is for regulating conspecific beneficial interactions that are acquired from the environment."
https://openalex.org/W2056442939,"The concealed phase of arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC) may initially manifest electrophysiologically. No studies have examined dynamic conduction/repolarization kinetics to distinguish benign right ventricular outflow tract ectopy (RVOT ectopy) from ARVC's early phase. We investigated dynamic endocardial electrophysiological changes that differentiate early ARVC disease expression from RVOT ectopy.22 ARVC (12 definite based upon family history and mutation carrier status, 10 probable) patients without right ventricular structural anomalies underwent high-density non-contact mapping of the right ventricle. These were compared to data from 14 RVOT ectopy and 12 patients with supraventricular tachycardias and normal hearts. Endocardial & surface ECG conduction and repolarization parameters were assessed during a standard S1-S2 restitution protocol.Definite ARVC without RV structural disease could not be clearly distinguished from RVOT ectopy during sinus rhythm or during steady state pacing. Delay in Activation Times at coupling intervals just above the ventricular effective refractory period (VERP) increased in definite ARVC (43 ± 20 ms) more than RVOT ectopy patients (36 ± 14 ms, p = 0.03) or Normals (25 ± 16 ms, p = 0.008) and a progressive separation of the repolarisation time curves between groups existed. Repolarization time increases in the RVOT were also greatest in ARVC (definite ARVC: 18 ± 20 ms; RVOT ectopy: 5 ± 14, Normal: 1 ± 18, p<0.05). Surface ECG correlates of these intracardiac measurements demonstrated an increase of greater than 48 ms in stimulus to surface ECG J-point pre-ERP versus steady state, with an 88% specificity and 68% sensitivity in distinguishing definite ARVC from the other groups. This technique could not distinguish patients with genetic predisposition to ARVC only (probable ARVC) from controls.Significant changes in dynamic conduction and repolarization are apparent in early ARVC before detectable RV structural abnormalities, and were present to a lesser degree in probable ARVC patients. Investigation of dynamic electrophysiological parameters may be useful to identify concealed ARVC in patients without disease pedigrees by using endocardial electrogram or paced ECG parameters."
https://openalex.org/W2096523175,"Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is still a serious global health burden. Despite improved therapeutic options, a preventative vaccine would be desirable especially in undeveloped countries. Traditionally, highly conserved epitopes are targets for antibody-based prophylactic vaccines. In HCV-infected patients, however, neutralizing antibodies are primarily directed against hypervariable region I (HVRI) in the envelope protein E2. HVRI is the most variable region of HCV, and this heterogeneity contributes to viral persistence and has thus far prevented the development of an effective HVRI-based vaccine. The primary goal of an antibody-based HCV vaccine should therefore be the induction of cross-reactive HVRI antibodies. In this study we approached this problem by presenting selected cross-reactive HVRI variants in a highly symmetric repeated array on capsid-like particles (CLPs). SplitCore CLPs, a novel particulate antigen presentation system derived from the HBV core protein, were used to deliberately manipulate the orientation of HVRI and therefore enable the presentation of conserved parts of HVRI. These HVRI-CLPs induced high titers of cross-reactive antibodies, including neutralizing antibodies. The combination of only four HVRI CLPs was sufficient to induce antibodies cross-reactive with 81 of 326 (24.8%) naturally occurring HVRI peptides. Most importantly, HVRI CLPs with AS03 as an adjuvant induced antibodies with a 10-fold increase in neutralizing capability. These antibodies were able to neutralize infectious HCVcc isolates and 4 of 19 (21%) patient-derived HCVpp isolates. Taken together, these results demonstrate that the induction of at least partially cross-neutralizing antibodies is possible. This approach might be useful for the development of a prophylactic HCV vaccine and should also be adaptable to other highly variable viruses."
https://openalex.org/W2002666242,"The Drosophila polypyrimidine tract-binding protein (dmPTB or hephaestus) plays an important role during embryogenesis. A loss of function mutation, heph03429, results in varied defects in embryonic developmental processes, leading to embryonic lethality. However, the suite of molecular functions that are disrupted in the mutant remains unknown. We have used an unbiased high throughput sequencing approach to identify transcripts that are misregulated in this mutant. Misregulated transcripts show evidence of significantly altered patterns of splicing (exon skipping, 5′ and 3′ splice site switching), alternative 5′ ends, and mRNA level changes (up and down regulation). These findings are independently supported by reverse-transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis and in situ hybridization. We show that a group of genes, such as Zerknüllt, z600 and screw are among the most upregulated in the mutant and have been functionally linked to dorso-ventral patterning and/or dorsal closure processes. Thus, loss of dmPTB function results in specific misregulated transcripts, including those that provide the missing link between the loss of dmPTB function and observed developmental defects in embryogenesis. This study provides the first comprehensive repertoire of genes affected in vivo in the heph mutant in Drosophila and offers insight into the role of dmPTB during embryonic development."
https://openalex.org/W2095181618,"Associate learning is fundamental to the acquisition of knowledge and plays a critical role in the everyday functioning of the developing child, though the developmental course is still unclear. This study investigated the development of visual associate learning in 125 school age children using the Continuous Paired Associate Learning task. As hypothesized, younger children made more errors than older children across all memory loads and evidenced decreased learning efficiency as memory load increased. Results suggest that age-related differences in performance largely reflect continued development of executive function in the context of relatively developed memory processes."
https://openalex.org/W2079900762,"This study explores the idea that an observer is sensitive to differences in the static traces of drawings that are due to differences in motor origin. In particular, our aim was to test if an observer is able to discriminate between drawings made by a robot and by a human in the case where the drawings contain salient kinematic cues for discrimination and in the case where the drawings only contain more subtle kinematic cues. We hypothesized that participants would be able to correctly attribute the drawing to a human or a robot origin when salient kinematic cues are present. In addition, our study shows that observers are also able to detect the producer behind the drawings in the absence of these salient kinematic cues. The design was such that in the absence of salient kinematic cues, the drawings are visually very similar, i.e. only differing in subtle kinematic differences. Observers thus had to rely on these subtle kinematic differences in the line trajectories between drawings. However, not only motor origin (human versus robot) but also motor style (natural versus mechanic) plays a role in attributing a drawing to the correct producer, because participants scored less high when the human hand draws in a relatively mechanical way. Overall, this study suggests that observers are sensitive to subtle kinematic differences between visually similar marks in drawings that have a different motor origin. We offer some possible interpretations inspired by the idea of “motor resonance”."
