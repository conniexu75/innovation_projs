https://openalex.org/W3007217854,"Simultaneously optimizing many design parameters in time-consuming experiments causes bottlenecks in a broad range of scientific and engineering disciplines1,2. One such example is process and control optimization for lithium-ion batteries during materials selection, cell manufacturing and operation. A typical objective is to maximize battery lifetime; however, conducting even a single experiment to evaluate lifetime can take months to years3–5. Furthermore, both large parameter spaces and high sampling variability3,6,7 necessitate a large number of experiments. Hence, the key challenge is to reduce both the number and the duration of the experiments required. Here we develop and demonstrate a machine learning methodology to efficiently optimize a parameter space specifying the current and voltage profiles of six-step, ten-minute fast-charging protocols for maximizing battery cycle life, which can alleviate range anxiety for electric-vehicle users8,9. We combine two key elements to reduce the optimization cost: an early-prediction model5, which reduces the time per experiment by predicting the final cycle life using data from the first few cycles, and a Bayesian optimization algorithm10,11, which reduces the number of experiments by balancing exploration and exploitation to efficiently probe the parameter space of charging protocols. Using this methodology, we rapidly identify high-cycle-life charging protocols among 224 candidates in 16 days (compared with over 500 days using exhaustive search without early prediction), and subsequently validate the accuracy and efficiency of our optimization approach. Our closed-loop methodology automatically incorporates feedback from past experiments to inform future decisions and can be generalized to other applications in battery design and, more broadly, other scientific domains that involve time-intensive experiments and multi-dimensional design spaces. A closed-loop machine learning methodology of optimizing fast-charging protocols for lithium-ion batteries can identify high-lifetime charging protocols accurately and efficiently, considerably reducing the experimental time compared to simpler approaches."

https://openalex.org/W3008965931,"Perovskite solar cells, as an emerging high-efficiency and low-cost photovoltaic technology1–6, face obstacles on their way towards commercialization. Substantial improvements have been made to device stability7–10, but potential issues with lead toxicity and leaching from devices remain relatively unexplored11–16. The potential for lead leakage could be perceived as an environmental and public health risk when using perovskite solar cells in building-integrated photovoltaics17–23. Here we present a chemical approach for on-device sequestration of more than 96 per cent of lead leakage caused by severe device damage. A coating of lead-absorbing material is applied to the front and back sides of the device stack. On the glass side of the front transparent conducting electrode, we use a transparent lead-absorbing molecular film containing phosphonic acid groups that bind strongly to lead. On the back (metal) electrode side, we place a polymer film blended with lead-chelating agents between the metal electrode and a standard photovoltaic packing film. The lead-absorbing films on both sides swell to absorb the lead, rather than dissolve, when subjected to water soaking, thus retaining structural integrity for easy collection of lead after damage. Using lead-absorbing materials to coat the front and back of perovskite solar cells can prevent lead leaching from damaged devices, without affecting the device performance or long-term operation stability."
https://openalex.org/W3007402690,"Gastruloids are three-dimensional aggregates of embryonic stem cells that display key features of mammalian development after implantation, including germ-layer specification and axial organization1–3. To date, the expression pattern of only a small number of genes in gastruloids has been explored with microscopy, and the extent to which genome-wide expression patterns in gastruloids mimic those in embryos is unclear. Here we compare mouse gastruloids with mouse embryos using single-cell RNA sequencing and spatial transcriptomics. We identify various embryonic cell types that were not previously known to be present in gastruloids, and show that key regulators of somitogenesis are expressed similarly between embryos and gastruloids. Using live imaging, we show that the somitogenesis clock is active in gastruloids and has dynamics that resemble those in vivo. Because gastruloids can be grown in large quantities, we performed a small screen that revealed how reduced FGF signalling induces a short-tail phenotype in embryos. Finally, we demonstrate that embedding in Matrigel induces gastruloids to generate somites with the correct rostral–caudal patterning, which appear sequentially in an anterior-to-posterior direction over time. This study thus shows the power of gastruloids as a model system for exploring development and somitogenesis in vitro in a high-throughput manner. Single-cell RNA sequencing and spatial transcriptomics reveal that the somitogenesis clock is active in mouse gastruloids, which can be induced to generate somites with the correct rostral–caudal patterning."
https://openalex.org/W3008176582,"Group 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2s) regulate inflammation and immunity in mammalian tissues1,2. Although ILC2s are found in cancers of these tissues3, their roles in cancer immunity and immunotherapy are unclear. Here we show that ILC2s infiltrate pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas (PDACs) to activate tissue-specific tumour immunity. Interleukin-33 (IL33) activates tumour ILC2s (TILC2s) and CD8+ T cells in orthotopic pancreatic tumours but not heterotopic skin tumours in mice to restrict pancreas-specific tumour growth. Resting and activated TILC2s express the inhibitory checkpoint receptor PD-1. Antibody-mediated PD-1 blockade relieves ILC2 cell-intrinsic PD-1 inhibition to expand TILC2s, augment anti-tumour immunity, and enhance tumour control, identifying activated TILC2s as targets of anti-PD-1 immunotherapy. Finally, both PD-1+ TILC2s and PD-1+ T cells are present in most human PDACs. Our results identify ILC2s as anti-cancer immune cells for PDAC immunotherapy. More broadly, ILC2s emerge as tissue-specific enhancers of cancer immunity that amplify the efficacy of anti-PD-1 immunotherapy. As ILC2s and T cells co-exist in human cancers and share stimulatory and inhibitory pathways, immunotherapeutic strategies to collectively target anti-cancer ILC2s and T cells may be broadly applicable."
https://openalex.org/W3007856943,"Proper brain function depends on neurovascular coupling: neural activity rapidly increases local blood flow to meet moment-to-moment changes in regional brain energy demand1. Neurovascular coupling is the basis for functional brain imaging2, and impaired neurovascular coupling is implicated in neurodegeneration1. The underlying molecular and cellular mechanisms of neurovascular coupling remain poorly understood. The conventional view is that neurons or astrocytes release vasodilatory factors that act directly on smooth muscle cells (SMCs) to induce arterial dilation and increase local blood flow1. Here, using two-photon microscopy to image neural activity and vascular dynamics simultaneously in the barrel cortex of awake mice under whisker stimulation, we found that arteriolar endothelial cells (aECs) have an active role in mediating neurovascular coupling. We found that aECs, unlike other vascular segments of endothelial cells in the central nervous system, have abundant caveolae. Acute genetic perturbations that eliminated caveolae in aECs, but not in neighbouring SMCs, impaired neurovascular coupling. Notably, caveolae function in aECs is independent of the endothelial NO synthase (eNOS)-mediated NO pathway. Ablation of both caveolae and eNOS completely abolished neurovascular coupling, whereas the single mutants exhibited partial impairment, revealing that the caveolae-mediated pathway in aECs is a major contributor to neurovascular coupling. Our findings indicate that vasodilation is largely mediated by endothelial cells that actively relay signals from the central nervous system to SMCs via a caveolae-dependent pathway."
https://openalex.org/W2908766652,"Topological physics relies on the structure of the eigenstates of the Hamiltonians. The geometry of the eigenstates is encoded in the quantum geometric tensor1—comprising the Berry curvature2 (crucial for topological matter)3 and the quantum metric4, which defines the distance between the eigenstates. Knowledge of the quantum metric is essential for understanding many phenomena, such as superfluidity in flat bands5, orbital magnetic susceptibility6,7, the exciton Lamb shift8 and the non-adiabatic anomalous Hall effect6,9. However, the quantum geometry of energy bands has not been measured. Here we report the direct measurement of both the Berry curvature and the quantum metric in a two-dimensional continuous medium—a high-finesse planar microcavity10—together with the related anomalous Hall drift. The microcavity hosts strongly coupled exciton–photon modes (exciton polaritons) that are subject to photonic spin–orbit coupling11 from which Dirac cones emerge12, and to exciton Zeeman splitting, breaking time-reversal symmetry. The monopolar and half-skyrmion pseudospin textures are measured using polarization-resolved photoluminescence. The associated quantum geometry of the bands is extracted, enabling prediction of the anomalous Hall drift, which we measure independently using high-resolution spatially resolved epifluorescence. Our results unveil the intrinsic chirality of photonic modes, the cornerstone of topological photonics13–15. These results also experimentally validate the semiclassical description of wavepacket motion in geometrically non-trivial bands9,16. The use of exciton polaritons (interacting photons) opens up possibilities for future studies of quantum fluid physics in topological systems. Direct measurement of the Berry curvature and the quantum metric of photonic modes in a high-finesse planar microcavity is achieved, enabling quantitative prediction of the independently measured anomalous Hall drift."
https://openalex.org/W3008967181,"The sympathetic nervous system innervates peripheral organs to regulate their function and maintain homeostasis, whereas target cells also produce neurotrophic factors to promote sympathetic innervation1,2. The molecular basis of this bi-directional communication remains to be fully determined. Here we use thermogenic adipose tissue from mice as a model system to show that T cells, specifically γδ T cells, have a crucial role in promoting sympathetic innervation, at least in part by driving the expression of TGFβ1 in parenchymal cells via the IL-17 receptor C (IL-17RC). Ablation of IL-17RC specifically in adipose tissue reduces expression of TGFβ1 in adipocytes, impairs local sympathetic innervation and causes obesity and other metabolic phenotypes that are consistent with defective thermogenesis; innervation can be fully rescued by restoring TGFβ1 expression. Ablating γδ Τ cells and the IL-17RC signalling pathway also impairs sympathetic innervation in other tissues such as salivary glands. These findings demonstrate coordination between T cells and parenchymal cells to regulate sympathetic innervation."

https://openalex.org/W3007736386,"Substantia nigra dopamine neurons have been implicated in the initiation and invigoration of movement, presumably through their modulation of striatal projection neuron (SPN) activity. However, the impact of native dopaminergic transmission on SPN excitability has not been directly demonstrated. Using perforated patch-clamp recording, we found that optogenetic stimulation of nigrostriatal dopamine axons rapidly and persistently elevated the excitability of D1 receptor-expressing SPNs (D1-SPNs). The evoked firing of D1-SPNs increased within hundreds of milliseconds of stimulation and remained elevated for ≥ 10 min. Consistent with the negative modulation of depolarization- and Ca2+-activated K+ currents, dopaminergic transmission accelerated subthreshold depolarization in response to current injection, reduced the latency to fire, and transiently diminished action potential afterhyperpolarization. Persistent modulation was protein kinase A dependent and associated with a reduction in action potential threshold. Together, these data demonstrate that dopaminergic transmission potently increases D1-SPN excitability with a time course that could support subsecond and sustained behavioral control."

https://openalex.org/W3008256015,"Colonization, speciation and extinction are dynamic processes that influence global patterns of species richness1–6. Island biogeography theory predicts that the contribution of these processes to the accumulation of species diversity depends on the area and isolation of the island7,8. Notably, there has been no robust global test of this prediction for islands where speciation cannot be ignored9, because neither the appropriate data nor the analytical tools have been available. Here we address both deficiencies to reveal, for island birds, the empirical shape of the general relationships that determine how colonization, extinction and speciation rates co-vary with the area and isolation of islands. We compiled a global molecular phylogenetic dataset of birds on islands, based on the terrestrial avifaunas of 41 oceanic archipelagos worldwide (including 596 avian taxa), and applied a new analysis method to estimate the sensitivity of island-specific rates of colonization, speciation and extinction to island features (area and isolation). Our model predicts—with high explanatory power—several global relationships. We found a decline in colonization with isolation, a decline in extinction with area and an increase in speciation with area and isolation. Combining the theoretical foundations of island biogeography7,8 with the temporal information contained in molecular phylogenies10 proves a powerful approach to reveal the fundamental relationships that govern variation in biodiversity across the planet. Using a global molecular phylogenetic dataset of birds on islands, the sensitivity of island-specific rates of colonization, speciation and extinction to island features (area and isolation) is estimated."

https://openalex.org/W3007614199,"Metazoan development requires the robust proliferation of progenitor cells, the identities of which are established by tightly controlled transcriptional networks1. As gene expression is globally inhibited during mitosis, the transcriptional programs that define cell identity must be restarted in each cell cycle2–5 but how this is accomplished is poorly understood. Here we identify a ubiquitin-dependent mechanism that integrates gene expression with cell division to preserve cell identity. We found that WDR5 and TBP, which bind active interphase promoters6,7, recruit the anaphase-promoting complex (APC/C) to specific transcription start sites during mitosis. This allows APC/C to decorate histones with ubiquitin chains branched at Lys11 and Lys48 (K11/K48-branched ubiquitin chains) that recruit p97 (also known as VCP) and the proteasome, which ensures the rapid expression of pluripotency genes in the next cell cycle. Mitotic exit and the re-initiation of transcription are thus controlled by a single regulator (APC/C), which provides a robust mechanism for maintaining cell identity throughout cell division. WDR5 and TBP recruit anaphase-promoting complex to specific transcription start sites in mitosis, initiating a ubiquitin-dependent mechanism that preserves cell identity by linking gene expression and cell division."
https://openalex.org/W3006857944,"It has been established in recent years that the gut microbiome plays a role in health and disease, potentially via alterations in metabolites that influence host physiology. Although sleep disruption and gut dysbiosis have been associated with many of the same diseases, studies investigating the gut microbiome in the context of sleep disruption have yielded inconsistent results, and have not assessed the fecal metabolome. We exposed mice to five days of sleep disruption followed by four days of ad libitum recovery sleep, and assessed the fecal microbiome and fecal metabolome at multiple timepoints using 16S rRNA gene amplicons and untargeted LC-MS/MS mass spectrometry. We found global shifts in both the microbiome and metabolome in the sleep-disrupted group on the second day of recovery sleep, when most sleep parameters had recovered to baseline levels. We observed an increase in the Firmicutes:Bacteroidetes ratio, along with decreases in the genus Lactobacillus, phylum Actinobacteria, and genus Bifidobacterium in sleep-disrupted mice compared to control mice. The latter two taxa remained low at the fourth day post-sleep disruption. We also identified multiple classes of fecal metabolites that were differentially abundant in sleep-disrupted mice, some of which are physiologically relevant and commonly influenced by the microbiome. This included bile acids, and inference of microbial functional gene content suggested reduced levels of the microbial bile salt hydrolase gene in sleep-disrupted mice. Overall, this study adds to the evidence base linking disrupted sleep to the gut microbiome and expands it to the fecal metabolome, identifying sleep disruption-sensitive bacterial taxa and classes of metabolites that may serve as therapeutic targets to improve health after poor sleep."
https://openalex.org/W3007607446,"CRISPR–Cas immunity protects prokaryotes against invading genetic elements1. It uses the highly conserved Cas1–Cas2 complex to establish inheritable memory (spacers)2–5. How Cas1–Cas2 acquires spacers from foreign DNA fragments (prespacers) and integrates them into the CRISPR locus in the correct orientation is unclear6,7. Here, using the high spatiotemporal resolution of single-molecule fluorescence, we show that Cas1–Cas2 selects precursors of prespacers from DNA in various forms—including single-stranded DNA and partial duplexes—in a manner that depends on both the length of the DNA strand and the presence of a protospacer adjacent motif (PAM) sequence. We also identify DnaQ exonucleases as enzymes that process the Cas1–Cas2-loaded prespacer precursors into mature prespacers of a suitable size for integration. Cas1–Cas2 protects the PAM sequence from maturation, which results in the production of asymmetrically trimmed prespacers and the subsequent integration of spacers in the correct orientation. Our results demonstrate the kinetic coordination of prespacer precursor selection and PAM trimming, providing insight into the mechanisms that underlie the integration of functional spacers in the CRISPR loci. Cas1–Cas2 selects precursor prespacers from DNA fragments in a length- and PAM-sequence-dependent manner, and these precursors are trimmed by DnaQ exonucleases to enable integration into the CRISPR locus in the correct orientation."

The liver is a key metabolic organ exposed to high levels of intestinal products through portal vein and systemic circulation. An altered microbiota (i.e. “dysbiosis”) may lead to increased intestinal permeability, amplifying many of these gut-derived effects (3Leung C. Rivera L. Furness J.B. Angus P.W.

Sevelamer is a nonabsorbable resin used for the treatment of hyperphosphataemia in patients with chronic kidney disease.

In addition, sevelamer was demonstrated to exert a marked bile acid-binding effect, similar to the second-generation bile acid sequestrant (BAS), colesevelam (11Braunlin W. Zhorov E. Guo A.

The potential effects of BAS on reversal of liver injury and prevention of the progression of NASH, however, have not been studied. The current study revealed that treatment with the bile acid sequestrant sevelamer reversed liver injury and prevented the development of NASH, including steatosis, inflammation, and fibrosis in mice with Western diet–induced NAFLD (42% milk fat, 34% sucrose, and 0.2% cholesterol). These results suggest a novel role for BAS treatment in the prevention and treatment of NASH. To determine whether sevelamer intervention could decrease the severity of WD-induced NASH, mice were fed a WD for 15 weeks without any treatment and then for an additional 15 weeks either with no treatment or treatment with sevelamer. At the end of the 15-week WD feeding, livers from LF-fed mice showed no steatosis or inflammation, whereas those from WD-fed mice had steatosis, hepatocellular injury, and inflammation. After 15 weeks of sevelamer intervention, there were only small amounts of steatosis, injury, and inflammation (H&E-stained tissue; Fig. 1, A and B), significant decreases in body weight, liver weight, and fasting serum glucose levels in WD-fed mice (Table 1). These improvements were associated with decreased steatosis and reduced hepatic lipid levels as determined by coherent anti-Stokes Raman scattering (CARS) microscopy imaging (Fig. 1A), and liver triglyceride and cholesteryl ester measurements (Fig. 1C). Sevelamer intervention also increased fecal cholesterol and triglyceride levels, suggesting an increase in their excretion or a decrease in their absorption (Fig. 1D). Importantly, sevelamer intervention decreased the severity of liver fibrosis as determined by Picro Sirius Red (PSR) (Fig. 2, A and B) and collagen 1 staining (Fig. 2, C and D) in WD-fed mice. The reduction in fibrosis was associated with decreases in Tgfb, collagen 1a1 (Col1a1), and collagen 3a1 (Col3a1) mRNA expression (Fig. 2G), which indicates that sevelamer treatment may disrupt the pathophysiological processes responsible for collagen deposition. Sevelamer intervention also significantly reduced the pronounced hepatic inflammation found in WD-fed mice, as demonstrated by CD3 immunostaining (Fig. 2, E and F) and Ccl2 (Mcp1) mRNA expression (Fig. 2G). Collectively these data show that sevelamer intervention is capable of reversing several of pathological abnormalities that characterize NASH.Table 1Metabolic parameters for intervention/treatment/reversal studiesLFWDWD + sevelamerBody weight (g)38.4 ± 0.949.5 ± 1.1ap < 0.05 vs. LF.39.7 ± 1.0bp < 0.05 vs. WD.Liver weight (g)1.58 ± 0.043.93 ± 0.22ap < 0.05 vs. LF.1.98 ± 0.18bp < 0.05 vs. WD.Blood glucose (mg/dl)218 ± 12.2233 ± 7.6187 ± 14.1bp < 0.05 vs. WD.Serum ALT (units/liter)45.3 ± 3.188.3 ± 17.2ap < 0.05 vs. LF.54.4 ± 13.1bp < 0.05 vs. WD.Serum AST (units/liter)26.5 ± 0.848.2 ± 7.2ap < 0.05 vs. LF.42.1 ± 3.4a p < 0.05 vs. LF.b p < 0.05 vs. WD.

After 24 weeks in the absence of sevelamer, there were marked increases in body, liver, and fat weight in C57BL/6J mice fed the WD (Table 2). In addition, we found that the levels of serum triglycerides, cholesteryl ester, alanine transaminase (ALT), and aspartate transaminase (AST) were significantly elevated in WD-fed mice compared those in LF-fed control mice, which are indicative of impaired liver function and injury (Table 2). H&E-stained sections from livers demonstrated that WD-fed mice exhibited lipid accumulation characterized by a mixture of macro- and microvesicular steatosis (Fig. 3A). Label-free imaging with CARS microscopy also revealed increased hepatic neutral lipid accumulation (Fig. 3A), which corresponded to marked increases in liver triglyceride and cholesterol contents (Fig. 3B). Significantly, the addition of sevelamer to the WD prevented increases in body and liver weight, adipose content, as well as elevation of fasting blood glucose levels and serum triglyceride and cholesterol and ALT and AST levels (Table 2). Additionally, sevelamer administration prevented liver steatosis as determined by H&E staining, CARS microscopy, and biochemical measurement of liver triglyceride and cholesterol content (Fig. 3, A and B). Moreover, sevelamer treatment prevented the increase in lipid droplet size, as is evident calculated from fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM) images (Fig. 3C). The histogram of fat droplets above 85 μm2 demonstrated that, compared with WD, sevelamer prevented the increase in lipid droplet size to the same size that is seen in LF diet–treated mice (Fig. 3D). Importantly, sevelamer prevented the fibrotic changes found in WD-fed mice. Mice fed WD developed significant liver fibrosis, which was ameliorated by sevelamer, as determined by label-free SHG imaging (Fig. 4, A and B). Sevelamer also prevented profibrotic elevation of Tgfb, Col1a1, Col3a1, and, α-smooth muscle actin (Acta2) mRNA expression seen in WD-treated mice (Fig. 4D). These results indicate that sevelamer prevents WD-induced fibrosis associated with progressive liver injury.Table 2Metabolic parameters for prevention studiesWT LFWT WDWT WD + sevelamerBody weight (g)36.8 ± 0.346.3 ± 2.6ap < 0.05 vs. LF.37.9 ± 0.8bp < 0.05 vs. WD.Liver weight (g)1.68 ± 0.064.39 ± 0.26ap < 0.05 vs. LF.1.69 ± 0.09bp < 0.05 vs. WD.Fat weight (g)7.95 ± 0.3115.5 ± 1.09ap < 0.05 vs. LF.5.64 ± 0.42bp < 0.05 vs. WD.Lean weight (g)24.5 ± 0.3525.3 ± 0.5826.9 ± 0.47bp < 0.05 vs. WD.Fasting blood glucose (mg/dl)86.5 ± 7.1110 ± 7.0ap < 0.05 vs. LF.76.3 ± 5.0bp < 0.05 vs. WD.Serum ALT (units/liter)44.9 ± 1.378.5 ± 8.0ap < 0.05 vs. LF.46.3 ± 0.8bp < 0.05 vs. WD.Serum AST (units/liter)25.4 ± 3.139.7 ± 6.118.9 ± 1.5bp < 0.05 vs. WD.Serum triglycerides (mg/dl)61.0 ± 12.879.4 ± 9.834.9 ± 1.8bp < 0.05 vs. WD.Serum cholesterol (mg/dl)138 ± 9.8252 ± 29.8ap < 0.05 vs. LF.139 ± 4.1bp < 0.05 vs. WD.a p < 0.05 vs. LF.b p < 0.05 vs. WD.

To investigate the effect of sevelamer on WD-induced lipid dysregulation, untargeted lipidomics was carried out on livers from LF-, WD-, and WD plus sevelamer–fed mice. There was clear separation in the principal component analysis (PCA) plots among three groups (Fig. 5A). Major ions driving PCA separation were identified based on associated loading scatter plots (Fig. 5B). According to the metabolomics database (METLIN MS/MS Database) and MS/MS spectra, these ions were identified, and their relative abundances are depicted in the heat map (Fig. 5C). The levels of multiple lipids from different lipid classes, including phosphatidylcholine, phosphoethanolamine, triglyceride, sphingomyelin, cholesterol, lactosylceramide, cholesterol ester, retinol, lysophosphatidylcholine, and diglyceride, were changed by WD feeding. These changes were substantially abrogated by sevelamer treatment. More interestingly, the lipids decreased in WD-treated mice mainly belong to the species with docosahexaenoic acid side chain, whereas they were increased by sevelamer (Fig. 5C and Fig. S1). Bile acid compositions of patients with NASH are significantly different from those of healthy subjects (9Ferslew B.C. Xie G. Johnston C.K. Su M. Stewart P.W. Jia W. Brouwer K.L. Barritt 4th, A.S. Altered bile acid metabolome in patients with nonalcoholic steatohepatitis.Dig. Dis. Sci. 2015; 60 (26138654): 3318-332810.1007/s10620-015-3776-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). We measured the levels of individual bile acids in liver, ileum, and cecum (Fig. 6, A–C). Total bile acid levels decreased by sevelamer treatment in liver, intestine, and cecum. Moreover, this beneficial effect is associated with changes of bile acid composition (Fig. 6, A–C) in LF, WD, and WD + sevelamer–fed mice. The results showed that sevelamer treatment resulted in alterations of individual bile acid species including increased LCA in ileum and decreases in most of the other bile acids (Fig. 6B). Bile acids can absorb hydrophobic materials such as cholesterol and phospholipids to form mixed micelles. WD increased the bile acid hydrophobicity index, whereas sevelamer treatment decreased it (Fig. 6D). This result indicated that sevelamer decreased bile acid hydrophobicity, resulting in decreased lipid absorption from intestine. Microbiota of the cecum and colon were profiled in all treatment groups by 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Modest differences (Fig. 7A) in overall microbiome composition were noted across all three treatment groups in both the cecum (p = 0.074) and colon (p = 0.12). Pairwise PERMANOVA tests indicated that these differences were due primarily to the LF versus WD comparisons in both cecum (p = 0.052) and colon (p = 0.011). Furthermore, in the cecum, both LF and WD + sevelamer treatment groups exhibited significantly greater microbial diversity (Shannon’s H diversity index) compared with WD (p = 0.062 and p = 0.025, respectively; Fig. 7B); diversity was unchanged across treatment groups in the colon. No differences in microbial richness were noted in either the cecum or colon (Fig. 7B). The complex interactions between diet and sevelamer treatment were evident through comparison of the relative abundances of individual taxa between treatment groups (Fig. S2). In all three pairwise comparisons of treatment groups, multiple taxa differed significantly in relative abundance. Of note, the genus Lactobacillus (phylum Firmicutes) was depleted in the WD group compared with both LF and WD + sevelamer (p < 0.05 and p < 0.01, respectively). In contrast, the proteobacterial genus Desulfovibrio was enriched in WD compared with both LF and WD + sevelamer (p < 0.05 for each comparison). However, many other taxa differed between LF and WD + sevelamer animals, indicating that sevelamer treatment did not simply reverse the shifts of colonic microbiota observed in WD animals (i.e. LF versus WD). As described above, bile acid pools were altered by both WD and sevelamer treatment. Because intestinal bile acids not only act as anti-microbial agents but are metabolized by selected gut microbes (15Molinaro A. Wahlström A. Marschall H.U. Role of bile acids in metabolic control.Trends Endocrinol. Metab. 2018; 29 (29195686): 31-4110.1016/j.tem.2017.11.002Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar), we hypothesized that shifts in bile acid pools in the intestinal lumen might underlie the observed changes in gut microbiota. Consequently, concentrations of cecal bile acid species of LF, WD, and WD + sevelamer mice were correlated with the relative abundances of cecal and colon microbiota (Fig. 7C). In both anatomical sites, selected bacterial taxa were significantly associated (either positively or negatively) with a range of bile acid species. However, hierarchical clustering did not segregate bile acid species by taurine conjugation status or bacterial genera by phylum-level affiliation. For example, the genera Lactobacillus (of the phylum Firmicutes) and Alistipes (of the phylum Bacteroidetes) were negatively correlated with several conjugated and unconjugated bile acids, whereas diverse Firmicutes (Anaerotruncus, Coprococcus, Turicibacter, and Lachnospiraceae) were positively correlated with the same bile acid species. The present study indicates that bile acid sequestration sevelamer prevents and treats WD-induced NASH in mice, by decreasing the NASH hallmarks of lipid accumulation, inflammation, and fibrosis. Moreover, sevelamer was found to modulate the gut microbiome and bile acid metabolism, resulting in reversing microbiome complexity in cecum and increasing Lactobacillus and decreased inflammation related bacteria Desulfovibrio. Recent evidence indicates that treatment strategies for improving bile acid metabolism may prevent or slow the progression of liver disease (16Chiang J.Y.L. Ferrell J.M.

Bile acid sequestrants are orally administered nonabsorbable polymers that bind bile acids in the intestine to form nonabsorbable complexes, interrupting the enterohepatic circulation of intestinal bile acids. The present studies show that BAS treatment prevents and decreases the severity of manifestations of WD-induced (42% milk fat, 34% sucrose, and 0.2% cholesterol) NASH in C57BL/6J mice, including the decreases in serum AST, ALT, and lipids (Fig. 1 and Table 1) as determined by CARS for label-free imaging of lipid deposits (19Kleiner D.E.

Fibrosis is characterized by the excessive accumulation of extracellular matrix components, leading to disrupted tissue function in affected organs. Progressive fibrosis is the hallmark of NASH disease progression, and therefore, reducing fibrosis is an important goal of therapy. Sevelamer treatment prevents fibrosis in the liver on WD-induced NASH model, whereas mice fed WD developed significant liver fibrosis, which is associated with significant increases in liver profibrotic genes. These results indicated that sevelamer/bile acid sequestration might be possible candidates for treatment of human NASH. The human gut microbiota includes 10–100 trillion microorganisms, mainly bacteria, that vastly outnumber our own human cells (22Ursell L.K. Clemente J.C. Rideout J.R. Gevers D. Caporaso J.G.

However, the function of GluD1 and how it is involved in these conditions remain elusive. In this study, we generated a Grid1 gene-knockout (GluD1-KO) mouse line with a pure C57BL/6N genetic background and performed several behavioral analyses. Compared to a control group, GluD1-KO mice showed no significant anxiety-related behavioral differences, evaluated using behavior in an open field, elevated plus maze, a light-dark transition test, the resident-intruder test of aggression and sensorimotor gating evaluated by the prepulse inhibition test. However, GluD1-KO mice showed (1) higher locomotor activity in the open field, (2) decreased sociability and social novelty preference in the three-chambered social interaction test, (3) impaired memory in contextual, but not cued fear conditioning tests, and (4) enhanced depressive-like behavior in a forced swim test. Pharmacological studies revealed that enhanced depressive-like behavior in GluD1-KO mice was restored by the serotonin reuptake inhibitors imipramine and fluoxetine, but not the norepinephrine transporter inhibitor desipramine. In addition, biochemical analysis revealed no significant difference in protein expression levels, such as other glutamate receptors in the synaptosome and postsynaptic densities prepared from the frontal cortex and the hippocampus. These results suggest that GluD1 plays critical roles in fear memory, sociability, and depressive-like behavior."
https://openalex.org/W3007385511,"While many studies have examined the effects of neonicotinoid insecticides and the parasitic mite Varroa destructor on honey bees (Apis mellifera), more information on the combined effects of such stressors on gene expression, including neural related genes, and their impact on biological pathways is needed. This study analyzed the effects of field realistic concentrations of the neonicotinoid clothianidin on adult bees infested and not infested with V. destructor over 21 consecutive days and then determined bee survivorship, weight, deformed wing virus (DWV) levels and gene expression. V. destructor parasitism with or without clothianidin exposure was significantly associated with decreased survivorship, weight loss and higher DWV levels, while clothianidin exposure was only associated with higher levels of DWV. Expression analysis of the neural genes AmNlg-1, BlCh and AmAChE-2 showed that V. destructor caused a significant down-regulation of all of them, whereas clothianidin caused a significant down-regulation of only AmNrx-1 and BlCh. An interaction was only detected for AmNrx-1 expression. RNAseq analysis showed that clothianidin exposure resulted in 6.5 times more up-regulated differentially expressed genes (DEGs) than V. destructor alone and 123 times more than clothianidin combined with V. destructor. Similar results were obtained with down-regulated DEGs, except for a higher number of DEGs shared between V. destructor and the combined stressors. KEGG (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes) biological pathway analysis of the DEGs showed that the stressor linked to the highest number of KEGG pathways was clothianidin, followed by V. destructor, and then considerably fewer number of KEGG pathways with the combined stressors. The reduced numbers of DEGs and KEGG pathways associated with the DEGs for the combined stressors compared to the stressors alone indicates that the interaction of the stressors is not additive or synergistic, but antagonistic. The possible implications of the antagonistic effect on the number of DEGs are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W3007993450,"Calcifications can disrupt organ function in the cardiovascular system and the kidney, and are particularly common in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). Fetuin-A deficient mice maintained against the genetic background DBA/2 exhibit particularly severe soft tissue calcifications, while fetuin-A deficient C57BL/6 mice remain healthy. We employed molecular genetic analysis to identify risk factors of calcification in fetuin-A deficient mice. We sought to identify pharmaceutical therapeutic targets that could be influenced by dietary of parenteral supplementation. We studied the progeny of an intercross of fetuin-A deficient DBA/2 and C57BL/6 mice to identify candidate risk genes involved in calcification. We determined that a hypomorphic mutation of the Abcc6 gene, a liver ATP transporter supplying systemic pyrophosphate, and failure to regulate the Trpm6 magnesium transporter in kidney were associated with severity of calcification. Calcification prone fetuin-A deficient mice were alternatively treated with parenteral administration of fetuin-A dietary magnesium supplementation, phosphate restriction, or by or parenteral pyrophosphate. All treatments markedly reduced soft tissue calcification, demonstrated by computed tomography, histology and tissue calcium measurement. We show that pathological ectopic calcification in fetuin-A deficient DBA/2 mice is caused by a compound deficiency of three major extracellular and systemic inhibitors of calcification, namely fetuin-A, magnesium, and pyrophosphate. All three of these are individually known to contribute to stabilize protein-mineral complexes and thus inhibit mineral precipitation from extracellular fluid. We show for the first time a compound triple deficiency that can be treated by simple dietary or parenteral supplementation. This is of special importance in patients with advanced CKD, who commonly exhibit reduced serum fetuin-A, magnesium and pyrophosphate levels."

The objective of our study was to elucidate how joint effect of different combinations of chronic conditions impact the five year risk of functional disability at the population level. Methods Participants ≥65 years from the Canadian Study of Health and Aging were assessed for functional disability measured using activities of daily living (ADL) and instrumental ADL (IADL), and the presence of conditions in five disease domains; cardiometabolic, neurological, sensory, musculoskeletal, and respiratory. Logistic regression was used to assess the relationship between each disease domain and incident ADL and IADL measured at five years of follow up and population attributable risk (PAR) was modeled for diseases domains that were significantly associated with disability. Results were stratified by sex and age (65–74 years, ≥75 years). Results There were 6272 participants free of ADL disability and 4571 participants free from IADL disability at baseline. For incident ADL, the greatest PAR values were 21.3 (9.8–32.8) for the cardiometabolic domain in males 65–74 years, 22.7 (4.7–40.8) for the musculoskeletal domain for females aged 65–74 years, and 11.2 (2.8–19.7) for the musculoskeletal domain in males ≥75 years. The PAR for the musculoskeletal, sensory, and neurological domains were similar in females ≥75 years(9.3–9.9). PAR values were lower but followed similar patterns for IADL disability. Conclusion The chronic disease domains which most strongly predicted incident ADLs and IADLs did not account for the greatest amount of disability at the population level."
https://openalex.org/W3006750249,"Severe thrombocytopenia in dengue often prompts platelet transfusion primarily to reduce bleeding risk. In India, about 11–43% of dengue patients report receiving platelet transfusions which is considered scarce and expensive especially in resource limited settings. Herein, we evaluated the efficacy and safety of Carica papaya leaf extract (CPLE) in the management of severe thrombocytopenia (≤30,000/μL) in dengue infection. 51 laboratory confirmed adult dengue patients with platelet counts ≤30,000/μL were randomly assigned to either treatment (n = 26) or placebo (n = 24) group. By day 3, CPLE treated patients reported significantly (p = 0.007) increased platelet counts (482%± 284) compared to placebo (331%±370) group. In the treatment group, fewer patients received platelet transfusions (1/26 v/s 2/24) and their median time for platelets to recover to ≥ 50,000/μL was 2 days (IQR 2–3) compared to 3 days (IQR 2–4) in placebo. Overall, CPLE was safe and well tolerated with no significant decrease in mean hospitalization days. Plasma cytokine profiling revealed that by day 3, mean percent increase in TNFα and IFNγ levels in treatment group was less compared to that observed in placebos; (TNFα: 58.6% v/s 127.5%; p = 0.25 and IFNγ: 1.93% v/s 62.6% for; p = 0.12). While a mean percent increase in IL-6 levels occurred in placebos (15.92%±29.93%) by day 3, a decrease was noted in CPLE group (12.95%±21.75%; p = 0.0232). Inversely, CPLE treated patients reported a mean percent increase compared to placebo by day 3 (143% ±115.7% v/s 12.03%± 48.4%; p = 0.006). Further, by day 3, a faster clearance kinetics of viral NS1 antigenemia occurred–mean NS1 titers in treatment group decreased to 97.3% compared to 88% in placebos (p = 0.023). This study demonstrates safety and efficacy of CPLE in increasing platelet counts in severe thrombocytopenia in dengue infections. A possible immunomodulatory and antiviral activity may be attributed to CPLE treatment. These findings merit validation in larger prospective studies.

https://openalex.org/W3007067689,"ADP-ribosylation factor 6 (ARF6) is a well-studied protein that is involved in multiple biological functions including cell migration and invasion. The mechanism by which ARF6 regulates the migration and invasion of upper tract urothelial carcinoma (UTUC) is still unknown. MiR-145-5p is a tumor suppressor microRNA, which is downregulated in several cancer types. We aimed to elucidate the molecular mechanism underlying the regulation of ARF6 by miR-145-5p in UTUC. ARF6 expression was observed to be higher in UTUC tissues than paired adjacent normal tissues. A reverse correlation between ARF6 and miR-145-5p was found in UTUC tissues. MiR-145-5p inhibited ARF6 expression by directly targeting its 3′-UTR. The functional studies indicated that ARF6 expression reversed the miR-145-5p-reduced tumor cell migration and invasion. Notably, miR-145-5p reduced MMP2, N-cadherin, FAK and MMP7, and elevated E-cadherin protein levels in vitro; however, the above effects were reversed by ARF6. Further, the expression of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) markers and cell invasion was suppressed by knocking down MMP7 in UTUC cells. These findings suggest that miR-145-5p may suppress UTUC cell motility and invasion by targeting ARF6/MMP7 through EMT."

Leptospermum scoparium J.R. Forst and G. Forst (manuka) essential oil and its four fractions were analyzed for chemical composition and toxicity against Aedes aegypti larvae. The use of bio-based amylose-N-1-hexadecylammonium chloride inclusion complexes (Hex-Am) as an emulsifier for L. scoparium essential oil was also investigated. Fraction 1 was inactive, fractions 2 (LC50 = 12.24 ppm) and 3 (LC50 = 20.58 ppm) were more toxic than the whole essential oil (LC50 = 47.97 ppm), and fraction 4 (LC50 = 35.87 ppm) had similar toxicity as the whole essential oil. Twenty-one chemical constituents were detected in L. scoparium essential oil compared to 16, 5, 19 and 25 chemical constituents in fractions, 1, 2, 3 and 4 respectively. The two most dominant chemical constituents were calamenene (17.78%) and leptospermone (11.86%) for L. scoparium essential oil, calamenene (37.73%) and ledene (10.37%) for fraction 1, leptospermone (56.6%) and isoleptospermone (19.73) for fraction 2, cubenol (24.30%) and caryophyllene oxide (12.38%) for fraction 3, and γ-gurjunene (21.62%) and isoleptospermone (7.88%) for fraction 4. Alpha-pinene, ledene, and aromandendrene were 2-7 times less toxic than the whole essential suggesting that the toxicity of L. scoparium essential oil was either due to other chemical constituents that were not tested or due synergist interactions among chemical constituents. Leptospermum scoparium essential oil-Hex-Am emulsion (LC50 = 29.62) was more toxic than the whole essential oil. These findings suggest that L. scoparium essential oil is a promising source of mosquito larvicide and that Hex-Am is an excellent emulsifier for L. scoparium essential oil for use as a larvicide."
https://openalex.org/W3007817087,"The corpus luteum is an endocrine gland that synthesizes and secretes progesterone. Luteinizing hormone (LH) activates protein kinase A (PKA) signaling in luteal cells, increasing delivery of substrate to mitochondria for progesterone production. Mitochondria maintain a highly regulated equilibrium between fusion and fission in order to sustain biological function. Dynamin-related protein 1 (DRP1), is a key mediator of mitochondrial fission. The mechanism by which DRP1 is regulated in the ovary is largely unknown. We hypothesize that LH via PKA differentially regulates the phosphorylation of DRP1 on Ser616 and Ser637 in bovine luteal cells. In primary cultures of steroidogenic small luteal cells (SLCs), LH, and forskolin stimulated phosphorylation of DRP1 (Ser 637), and inhibited phosphorylation of DRP1 (Ser 616). Overexpression of a PKA inhibitor blocked the effects of LH and forskolin on DRP1 phosphorylation. In addition, LH decreased the association of DRP1 with the mitochondria. Genetic knockdown of the DRP1 mitochondria receptor, and a small molecule inhibitor of DRP1 increased basal and LH-induced progesterone production. Studies with a general Dynamin inhibitor and siRNA knockdown of DRP1 showed that DRP1 is required for optimal LH-induced progesterone biosynthesis. Taken together, the findings place DRP1 as an important target downstream of PKA in steroidogenic luteal cells."
https://openalex.org/W3007050786,"Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) affects around 10% of young women, with adverse consequences on fertility and cardiometabolic outcomes. PCOS appears to result from a genetic predisposition interacting with developmental events during fetal or perinatal life. We hypothesised that PCOS candidate genes might be expressed in the fetal ovary when the stroma develops; mechanistically linking the genetics, fetal origins and adult ovarian phenotype of PCOS. In bovine fetal ovaries (n = 37) of 18 PCOS candidate genes only SUMO1P1 was not expressed. Three patterns of expression were observed: early gestation (FBN3, GATA4, HMGA2, TOX3, DENND1A, LHCGR and FSHB), late gestation (INSR, FSHR, and LHCGR) and throughout gestation (THADA, ERBB4, RAD50, C8H9orf3, YAP1, RAB5B, SUOX and KRR1). A splice variant of FSHB exon 3 was also detected early in the bovine ovaries, but exon 2 was not detected. Three other genes, likely to be related to the PCOS aetiology (AMH, AR and TGFB1I1), were also expressed late in gestation. Significantly within each of the three gene groups, the mRNA levels of many genes were highly correlated with each other, despite, in some instances, being expressed in different cell types. TGFβ is a well-known stimulator of stromal cell replication and collagen synthesis and TGFβ treatment of cultured fetal ovarian stromal cells inhibited the expression of INSR, AR, C8H9orf3 and RAD50 and stimulated the expression of TGFB1I1. In human ovaries (n = 15, < 150 days gestation) many of the same genes as in bovine (FBN3, GATA4, HMGA2, FSHR, DENND1A and LHCGR but not TOX3 or FSHB) were expressed and correlated with each other. With so many relationships between PCOS candidate genes during development of the fetal ovary, including TGFβ and androgen signalling, we suggest that future studies should determine if perturbations of these genes in the fetal ovary can lead to PCOS in later life."

The financial crisis in 2008 led to a distrust of the conventional financial system and consequently investors began to look with interest this new banking, which only invests in ethical activities and products, with social and environmental criteria, total transparency and a democratic management. The aim of this article is to analyze the economic structure of ethical banking, compared to that of conventional banking, by paying attention to its liquidity, coverage and solvency. Specifically, We compare the financial statements of Triodos Bank, the main European ethical bank belonging to the Global Alliance for Banking on Values, with two of the main conventional banks of each of the five countries in Europe in which it operates. To do this, we apply a financial and economic analysis to the period from 2015 to 2018, the means difference test and analysis of variance on an array of financial ratios and, finally, probit regressions. The results reveal that ethical banking is growing more than conventional banking and it presents greater liquidity and solvency, although, in general terms, its profitability is not higher. In conclusion, both savers and investors have guarantees that their savings are invested not only in a responsible but also in a confident way in ethical banking."
https://openalex.org/W3007996606,"Formins direct the elongation of unbranched actin filaments by binding their barbed ends and processively stepping onto incoming actin monomers to incorporate them into the filament. Binding of profilin to actin monomers creates profilin–actin complexes, which then bind polyproline tracts located in formin homology 1 (FH1) domains. Diffusion of these natively disordered domains enables direct delivery of profilin–actin to the barbed end, speeding the rate of filament elongation. In this study, we investigated the mechanism of coordinated actin delivery from the multiple polyproline tracts in formin FH1 domains. We found that each polyproline tract can efficiently mediate polymerization, but that all tracts do not generate the same rate of elongation. In WT FH1 domains, the multiple polyproline tracts compete to deliver profilin–actin to the barbed end. This competition ultimately limits the rate of formin-mediated elongation. We propose that intrinsic properties of the filament-binding FH2 domain tune the efficiency of FH1-mediated elongation by directly regulating the rate of monomer incorporation at the barbed end. A strong correlation between competitive FH1-mediated profilin–actin delivery and FH2-regulated gating of the barbed end effectively limits the elongation rate, thereby obviating the need for evolutionary optimization of FH1 domain sequences."
https://openalex.org/W3008212715,"Background Wolbachia has been reported to suppress a variety of pathogen infections in mosquitoes, but the mechanism is undefined. Two possibilities have been proposed. One is that Wolbachia activates host immune responses, and the other one is that Wolbachia competes with pathogens for limited nutrients. Methodology/Principal findings In this study, we compared host immune responses and the densities of two different strains of Wolbachia in naturally occurring parental and artificially created hybrid host genetic backgrounds. No significant difference in Wolbachia density was found between these hosts. We found that Wolbachia could activate host innate immune responses when the host genetic profile was different from that of its natural host. When these hosts were challenged with pathogenic bacteria, mosquitoes in new host-Wolbachia symbioses had a higher survival rate than in old host-Wolbachia symbioses. Conclusions/Significance The presence of Wolbachia per se does not necessarily affect pathogen infections, suggesting that a competition for limited nutrients is not the main reason for Wolbachia-mediated pathogen suppression. Instead, host immune responses are responsible for it. The elucidation of an immunity nature of PI is important to guide future practice: Wolbachia may be genetically engineered to be more immunogenic, it is desired to search and isolate more strains of Wolbachia, and test more host-Wolbachia symbioses for future applications. Our results also suggest Wolbachia-based PI may be applied to naturally Wolbachia-infected mosquito populations, and extend to the control of a broader range of mosquito-borne diseases."
https://openalex.org/W3005231146,"Despite its long history, dissociation remains under-recognised clinically, partly due to difficulties identifying dissociative symptoms. Qualitative research may support its recognition by providing a lived experience perspective. In non-affective psychosis, identification of dissociation may be particularly important given that such experiences have been implicated its development and maintenance. Therefore, this study aimed to understand in the context of psychosis: what it is like to experience dissociation; the impact dissociation might have; what factors begin, maintain or end dissociative experiences; and what beliefs people hold about dissociation.Qualitative interviews were carried out with twelve NHS patients with non-affective psychosis diagnoses and experience of dissociation. Data were analysed using Thematic Analysis.Dissociation involves subjective strangeness, unreality, disconnection, and shifts in perception. It impacts on mental health (including psychotic experiences), daily functioning, emotional connection, and can lead to social withdrawal. Stress, fatigue, and excessive internal focus may be involved in development and maintenance. Participants found it very difficult to describe the experience of dissociation, and, as a result, often did not mention it to others. Even when shared, interviewees reported that their descriptions were misunderstood and therefore they did not receive information or support specific to dissociation. The consensus was that experiences of dissociation are negative, but that understanding them better helped to enable coping.The core subjective experience of dissociation appears to be a felt sense of anomaly (FSA), and we therefore suggest clinicians proactively enquire about such experiences. Dissociation is distressing, and has multiple impacts, but can easily be overlooked due to difficulties describing it and behavioural similarities to negative psychotic symptoms such as withdrawal."
https://openalex.org/W3007503931,"Background Pulmonary artery (PA) enlargement, defined as pulmonary artery to ascending aorta diameter ratio (PA:A)>1 on computed tomography (CT), is a marker of pulmonary vascular disease in chronic lung diseases. PA enlargement is prevalent in cystic fibrosis (CF), but its relationship to hemodynamics and prognostic utility in severe CF are unknown. We hypothesized that the PA:A would have utility in identifying pulmonary hypertension (PH) in severe CF and that PA enlargement would be associated with reduced transplant-free survival. Methods We conducted a retrospective study of adults with CF undergoing lung transplant evaluation at a single center between 2000 and 2015. CT, right heart catheterization (RHC), and clinical data were collected. The PA:A was measured from a single CT slice. We measured associations between PA:A and invasive hemodynamic parameters including PH defined as a mPAP ≥25mmHg using adjusted linear and logistic regression models. Kaplan-Meier and adjusted Cox regression models were used to measure associations between PA:A>1, RHC-defined PH, and transplant-free survival in severe CF. Results We analyzed 78 adults with CF that had CT scans available for review, including 44 that also had RHC. RHC-defined PH defined as a mPAP ≥25mmHg was present in 36% of patients with CF undergoing transplant evaluation. The PA:A correlated with mPAP (r = 0.73; 95% CI 3.87-7.80; p 1 was an independent predictor of PH (aOR 4.50; 95% CI 1.05-19.2; p = 0.042). PA:A>1 was independently associated with increased hazards for death or transplant (aHR 2.69; 95% CI 1.41-5.14; P = 0.003). The presence of mPAP ≥25mmHg was independently associated with decreased survival in this cohort. Conclusions PA enlargement is associated with pulmonary hemodynamics and PH in severe CF. PA enlargement is an independent prognostic indicator of PH and decreased survival in this population."
https://openalex.org/W3006763125,"The liver maintains metabolic homeostasis by integrating the regulation of nutrient status with both hormonal and neural signals. Many studies on hepatic signaling in response to nutrients have been conducted in mice. However, no in-depth study is currently available that has investigated genome-wide changes in gene expression during the normal physiological fasting-feeding cycle in nutrient-sensitive and -insensitive mice. Using two strains of mice, C57BL/6J and BALB/cJ, and deploying deep RNA-Seq complemented with quantitative RT-PCR, we found that feeding causes substantial and transient changes in gene expression in the livers of both mouse strains. The majority of significantly changed transcripts fell within the areas of biological regulation and cellular and metabolic processes. Among the metabolisms of three major types of macronutrients (i.e. carbohydrates, proteins, and lipids), feeding affected lipid metabolism the most. We also noted that the C57BL/6J and BALB/cJ mice significantly differed in gene expression and in changes in gene expression in response to feeding. In both fasted and fed states, both mouse strains shared common expression patterns for about 10,200 genes, and an additional 400–600 genes were differentially regulated in one strain but not the other. Among the shared genes, more lipogenic genes were induced upon feeding in BABL/cJ than in C57BL/6J mice. In contrast, in the population of differentially enriched genes, C57BL/6J mice expressed more genes involved in lipid metabolism than BALB/cJ mice. In summary, these results reveal that the two mouse strains used here exhibit several differences in feeding-induced hepatic responses in gene expression, especially in lipogenic genes."
https://openalex.org/W3008056245,"The COP9 signalosome (CSN) is a conserved eukaryotic complex, essential for vitality in all multicellular organisms and critical for the turnover of key cellular proteins through catalytic and non-catalytic activities. Saccharomyces cerevisiae is a powerful model organism for studying fundamental aspects of the CSN complex, since it includes a conserved enzymatic core but lacks non-catalytic activities, probably explaining its non-essentiality for life. A previous transcriptomic analysis of an S. cerevisiae strain deleted in the CSN5/RRI1 gene, encoding to the CSN catalytic subunit, revealed a downregulation of genes involved in lipid metabolism. We now show that the S. cerevisiae CSN holocomplex is essential for cellular lipid homeostasis. Defects in CSN assembly or activity lead to decreased quantities of ergosterol and unsaturated fatty acids (UFA); vacuole defects; diminished lipid droplets (LDs) size; and to accumulation of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. The molecular mechanism behind these findings depends on CSN involvement in upregulating mRNA expression of SPT23. Spt23 is a novel activator of lipid desaturation and ergosterol biosynthesis. Our data reveal for the first time a functional link between the CSN holocomplex and Spt23. Moreover, CSN-dependent upregulation of SPT23 transcription is necessary for the fine-tuning of lipid homeostasis and for cellular health."

However, heme has also been shown to be an important regulatory molecule (as “labile” heme) for diverse processes such as translation, kinase activity, and transcription in mammals, yeast, and bacteria. Taking advantage of a yeast strain deficient for heme production that enabled controlled modulation and monitoring of labile heme levels, here we investigated the role of labile heme in the regulation of mitochondrial biogenesis.

Mitochondria are organelles that have a critical role in the energy and intermediary metabolism in eukaryotic cells. They are well-known for their involvement in the synthesis of ATP, the currency in charge of fulfilling cell energy demand.

Although mitochondria possess their own genome (mtDNA), they are genetically semiautonomous. Indeed, the mtDNA encodes a few (8 in yeast and 13 in mammals) of the numerous proteins constituting the OXPHOS. All of the remaining OXPHOS components and mitochondrial proteins (protein machineries involved in mtDNA replication, transcription and translation, assembly factors, mitochondrial protein import, and intermediary metabolism) are encoded by the nuclear genome. Thus, regulation of the expression of both mitochondrial and nuclear genes encoding mitochondrial proteins is controlled by a defined network of nuclear transcription factors. In the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the transcription factors Hap2p/3p/4p/5p (HAP complex) are the master regulators of mitochondrial biogenesis (7Lascaris R. Bussemaker H.J. Boorsma A.

Thus, although the name HAP historically stands for “heme activator protein,” the HAP complex is sometimes designated like a heme-independent transcription factor (33Liu Z. Butow R. A transcriptional switch in the expression of yeast tricarboxylic acid cycle genes in response to a reduction or loss of respiratory function.Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19 (10490611): 6720-672810.1128/MCB.19.10.6720Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Taking advantage of a yeast strain deficient for heme production, we tackled this question. Our results are the first to show that cellular labile heme is critical for the HAP complex activity, most likely through an enhancement of the stability of the co-activator Hap4p. Consequently, labile heme regulates mitochondrial biogenesis and cell growth. This work represents a new contribution to the field of mitochondrial biogenesis regulation by cell metabolites. Our cell growth experiments were carried out on a nonfermentable substrate: lactate. In this condition, the mitochondrial compartment is well-differentiated, and mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation processes and the HAP complex are mandatory for cell growth and proliferation. The heme biosynthesis pathway is localized within two distinct compartments: the mitochondria and the cytosol (Scheme 1). To modulate the cellular labile heme pool, we made use of a strain deleted for the first enzyme of this pathway: Hem1p. This enzyme, which is localized in the mitochondrial matrix, catalyzes the condensation of glycine with succinyl-CoA to generate δ-aminolevulinate (ALA). A strain deleted for this enzyme is auxotrophic for ALA (35Thorsness M. Schafer W. D'Ari L. Rine J. Positive and negative transcriptional control by heme of genes encoding 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.Mol. Cell.

In an attempt to modulate cellular labile heme, the Δhem1 strain was supplemented with increasing concentrations of ALA, and the cellular labile heme pool was assessed thanks to the reliable HMG2-lacZ reporter gene (35Thorsness M.

In this system, expression of the β-gal is under the regulation of the HMG2 promoter, which is strongly repressed by the heme level. Fig. 1 shows that whereas this promoter's activity is low in WT cells, this activity is strongly increased in Δhem1 cells grown in the presence of low (5 and 10 μg/ml) ALA concentrations. Increasing extracellular ALA concentrations lead to a decrease in this promoter's activity. This shows that modulation of extracellular ALA in a Δhem1 strain allows modulation of the cellular labile heme pool. Extracellular ALA concentration above 100 μg/ml in both WT and Δhem1 cells did not increase the repression of HMG2-lacZ reporter gene (data not shown).Figure 1Assessment of the labile heme level through the activity of HMG2 promoter-lacZ gene at different concentrations of ALA. WT and Δhem1 cells were transformed with a plasmid encoding the reporter gene HMG2-LacZ, which is negatively regulated by labile heme. The growth medium of Δhem1 cells was supplemented with 5 μg·ml−1 (Δhem1-ALA5-), 10 μg·ml−1 (Δhem1-ALA10-), 25 μg·ml−1 (Δhem1-ALA25-), or 100 μg·ml−1 (Δhem1-ALA100-) ALA. Cells were harvested, and β-gal activities were measured and expressed as a percentage of WT. Results shown represent means ± S.D.

Further, mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation requires heme biosynthesis to generate mitochondrial cytochromes. We thus investigated mitochondrial activities in Δhem1 cells supplemented with various concentrations of ALA. Fig. 2A shows that there is a 50% decrease in Δhem1-ALA5- cellular respiratory rate compared with the WT cells. Increasing extracellular ALA up to 100 μg/ml allowed a full restoration of the cellular respiratory rate. Fig. 2B shows that this modulation of the cellular respiratory rate affected the cellular growth rate, and the relationship between these two parameters is linear (Fig. 2B, inset), as shown previously (3Devin A.

Increasing extracellular ALA up to 100 μg/ml allows a full restoration of this activity. Furthermore, cytochrome c oxidase activity perfectly correlates with respiratory rate (Fig. 2C, inset). The above-mentioned results relate to the oxidative phosphorylation amount/activity. To determine whether we observed an overall quantitative regulation of the mitochondrial compartment, we assessed citrate synthase activity, a well-accepted marker of mitochondrial amount within cells (40Mogensen M.

Fig. 2D shows that there is a 60% decrease in Δhem1-ALA5- citrate synthase activity compared with the WT cells.

The inset in Fig. 2D shows a very good correlation between respiratory rate and citrate synthase activity, reinforcing the hypothesis of an overall regulation of the mitochondrial compartment upon the addition of ALA in Δhem1 cells. Within the cell, mitochondria are highly dynamic organelles that form a network. They undergo fusion and fission events continuously, leading to a diverse range of mitochondrial morphologies, from fragmented states to continuous networks (43McBride H.M. Neuspiel M. Wasiak S. Mitochondria: more than just a powerhouse.Curr. Biol. 2006; 16 (16860735): R551-R56010.1016/j.cub.2006.06.054Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1301) Google Scholar, 44Hoppins S.

It remains unclear how the diverse morphologies interact with bioenergetic properties. To determine whether the mitochondrial structure/network was altered when mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation activities decreased, we performed both fluorescence and electronic microscopy under our experimental conditions. Fig. 3A shows that when visualized in fluorescence microscopy, mitochondria exhibit a well-differentiated network, comparable with that of the WT for any of the extracellular ALA concentrations tested. Fig. 3B shows that when visualized in EM, mitochondria exhibit a coherent ultrastructure, comparable with that of the WT for any of the extracellular ALA concentration tested. However, for the lowest (Δhem1-ALA5- and Δhem1-ALA10-) ALA concentrations, a decrease in mitochondrial diameter was observed. For higher ALA concentrations, the mitochondrial diameter was comparable with that of the WT. The amount of mitochondria within a cell is controlled by its turnover (i.e. the respective rates of mitochondrial biogenesis and mitochondrial degradation). The HAP complex has been shown to be involved in the specific induction of genes involved in gluconeogenesis, metabolism of alternate carbon sources, respiration, and mitochondrial development. The disruption of any subunit of this complex renders the cells unable to grow on nonfermentable carbon sources (10Hahn S. Pinkham J. Wei R. Miller R. Guarente L.

Fig. 4A shows that under low cellular labile heme condition (Δhem1-ALA5-), the activity of the HAP complex is highly decreased, and this activity increases proportionally with the amount of cellular labile heme, being slightly higher than in the WT for the Δhem1-ALA100- condition. The master regulator of the activity of the HAP multicomplex is the subunit Hap4p (11Forsburg S.L. Guarente L.

There is not currently a widely used consensus for the appropriate statistical test, or more specifically the multiple testing correction procedure, used to detect segregation distortion for high-density single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) data. Here we examine the efficacy of various multiple testing procedures, including chi-square test with no correction for multiple testing, false-discovery rate correction and Bonferroni correction using an in-silico simulation of a biparental mapping population. We find that the false discovery rate correction best approximates the traditional p-value threshold of 0.05 for high-density marker data. We also utilize this simulation to test the effect of segregation distortion on the genetic mapping process, specifically on the formation of linkage groups during marker clustering. Only extreme segregation distortion was found to effect genetic mapping. In addition, we utilize replicate empirical mapping populations of wheat varieties Avalon and Cadenza to assess how often segregation distortion conforms to the same pattern between closely related wheat varieties."

Interestingly, the secreted protein content is also affected by the rapamycin treatment. Finally, homologs of the components of TOR pathway can be identified in P. chrysosporium.

https://openalex.org/W3007765586,"Previously, applications of intensity analysis (IA) on land use and land cover change (LULCC) studies have focused on deviations from uniform intensity (UI) and failed to quantify the reasons behind these deviations. This study presents the application of IA with hypothetical errors that could explain non-uniform LULCC in the context of IA at four-time points. LULCC in the Ashi watershed was examined using Landsat images from 1990, 2000, 2010 and 2014 showing the classes: Urban, water, agriculture, close canopy, open canopy and other vegetation. Matrices were created to statistically examine LULCC using IA. The results reveal that the seeming LULCC intensities are not uniform with respect to the interval, category and transition levels of IA. Error analysis indicates that, hypothetical errors in 13%, 19% and 11.2% of the 2000, 2010 and 2014 maps respectively could account for all differences between the observed gain intensities and the UI; while errors in 12%, 21%, and 11% of the 1990, 2000 and 2010 maps respectively could account for all differences between the observed loss intensities and the UI. A hypothetical error in 0.6% and 1.6% of the 1990 map; 1.5% and 4% of the 2000 map; 1.2% and 2.1% of the 2010 map could explain divergences from uniform transitions given URB gain and AGR gain during 1990–2000, 2000–2010 and 2010–2014 respectively. Evidence for a specific deviation from the relevant hypothesized UI is either strong or weak depending on the size of these errors. We recommend that users of IA concept consider assessing their map errors, since limited ground information on past time point data exist. These errors will indicate strength of evidence for deviations and reveals patterns that increase researcher’s insight on LULCC processes."
https://openalex.org/W3008206800,"Home births in high risk pregnancies and unassisted childbirth seem to be increasing in the Netherlands. There is a lack of qualitative data on women’s partners’ involvement in these choices in the Dutch maternity care system, where integrated midwifery care and home birth are regular options in low risk pregnancies. The majority of available literature focuses on the women’s motivations, while the partner’s influence on these decisions is much less well understood. We aimed to examine partners’ involvement in the decision to birth outside the system, in order to provide medical professionals with insight and recommendations regarding their interactions with these partners in the outpatient clinic. An exploratory qualitative research design with a constructivist approach and a grounded theory method were used. In-depth interviews were performed with twenty-one partners on their involvement in the decision to go against medical advice in choosing a high risk childbirth setting. Open, axial and selective coding of the interview data was done in order to generate themes. Four main themes were found: 1) Talking it through, 2) A shared vision, 3) Defending our views, and 4) Doing it together. One overarching theme emerged that covered all other themes: ‘She convinced me’. These data show that the idea to choose a high risk birth setting almost invariably originated with the women, who did most of the research online, filtered the information and convinced the partners of the merit of their plans. Once the partners were convinced, they took a very active and supportive role in defending the plan to the outside world, as well as in preparing for the birth. Maternity care providers can use these findings in cases where there is a discrepancy between the wishes of the woman and the advice of the professional, so they can attempt to involve partners actively during consultations in pregnancy. That will ensure that partners also receive information on all options, risks and benefits of possible birth choices, and that they are truly in support of a final plan."
https://openalex.org/W3006684773,"Background The immune system of echinoderm sea urchins is characterised by a high degree of complexity that is not completely understood. The Mediterranean sea urchin Paracentrotus lividus coelomocytes mediate immune responses through phagocytosis, encapsulation of non-self particles, and production of diffusible factors including antimicrobial molecules. Details of these processes, and molecular pathways driving these mechanisms, are still to be fully elucidated. Principal findings In the present study we treated the sea urchin P. lividus with the bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and collected coelomocytes at different time-points (1, 3, 6 and 24 hours). We have shown, using label-free quantitative mass spectrometry, how LPS is able to modulate the coelomocyte proteome and to effect cellular pathways, such as endocytosis and phagocytosis, as soon as the immunomodulating agent is injected. The present study has also shown that treatment can modulate various cellular processes such as cytoskeleton reorganisation, and stress and energetic homeostasis. Conclusions Our data demonstrates, through mass spectrometry and the following functional annotation bioinformatics analysis, how the bacterial wall constituent is sufficient to set off an immune response inducing cytoskeleton reorganisation, the appearance of clusters of heat shock proteins (Hsp) and histone proteins and the activation of the endocytic and phagocytic pathways.

https://openalex.org/W3006764202,"Why do some individuals experience intrusive emotional memories following stressful or traumatic events whereas others do not? Attentional control may contribute to the development of such memories by shielding attention to ongoing tasks from affective reactions to task-irrelevant emotional stimuli. The present study investigated whether individual differences in theability to exert cognitive control are associated with experiencing intrusive emotional memories after laboratory trauma. Sixty-one healthy women provided self-reported and experimentally derived measures of attentional control. They then viewed a trauma film in the laboratory and recorded intrusive memories for one week using a diary. Gaze avoidance during trauma film exposure was associated with more intrusive memories. Greater attentional control over emotion prior to film viewing, as assessed with the experimental task, predicted fewer intrusive memories while self-reported attentional control was unrelated to intrusive memories. Preexisting capacity to shield information processing from distraction may protect individuals from developing intrusive emotional memories following exposure to stress or trauma. These findings provide important clues for prevention and intervention science."
https://openalex.org/W3007571404,"Unlike closely related GPCRs, protease-activated receptors (PAR1, PAR2, PAR3, and PAR4) have a predicted signal peptide at their N-terminus, which is encoded by a separate exon, suggesting that the signal peptides of PARs may serve an important and unique function, specific for PARs. In this report, we show that the PAR2 signal peptide, when fused to the N-terminus of IgG-Fc, effectively induced IgG-Fc secretion into culture medium, thus behaving like a classical signal peptide. The presence of PAR2 signal peptide has a strong effect on PAR2 cell surface expression, as deletion of the signal peptide (PAR2ΔSP) led to dramatic reduction of the cell surface expression and decreased responses to trypsin or the synthetic peptide ligand (SLIGKV). However, further deletion of the tethered ligand region (SLIGKV) at the N-terminus rescued the cell surface receptor expression and the response to the synthetic peptide ligand, suggesting that the signal peptide of PAR2 may be involved in preventing PAR2 from intracellular protease activation before reaching the cell surface. Supporting this hypothesis, an Arg36Ala mutation on PAR2ΔSP, which disabled the trypsin activation site, increased the receptor cell surface expression and the response to ligand stimulation. Similar effects were observed when PAR2ΔSP expressing cells were treated with protease inhibitors. Our findings indicated that there is a role of the PAR2 signal peptide in preventing the premature activation of PAR2 from intracellular protease cleavage before reaching the cells surface. The same mechanism may also apply to PAR1, PAR3, and PAR4."
https://openalex.org/W3007885654,"Objectives To explore parents’ experiences of seeking health care for their children and instead being accused by healthcare professionals of Shaken Baby Syndrome/Abusive Head Trauma (SBS/AHT), being reported to Social Services, undergoing judiciary processing, and the impact of these events on family (dis)integration. Methods Design: A qualitative study based on qualitative content analysis. Participants: Twelve parents in Sweden, mothers and fathers, seeking health care for their infants, encountering allegations of SBS/AHT, losing custody of their infants, and being subjected to a judiciary process, and finally regaining custody of their children. Data collection: In-depth interviews. Results An overarching theme ‘Fighting for protection of their child after being trapped by doctors’ and four sub-themes were developed to reflect the parents’ experiences, reactions and interpretations. The first sub-theme, ‘Being accused of injuring the child’, illuminated the shock experienced when seeking care and instead being accused of being a perpetrator. The second, ‘Chaos and powerlessness’, refers to the emotions experienced when losing custody of the child and being caught in the enforcement of legislation by the authorities. The third, ´The unified fight against the doctors’ verdict´, illustrates the parents’ fight for innocence, their worry for the lost child, and their support and resistance. The fourth, ‘The wounded posttraumatic growth’, describes the emotions, grief, panic, anxiety, and challenges in reuniting the family, but also the parents’ reflections on personal growth. Unanimously, they had experienced the authorities’ inability to reconsider, and expressed a deep mistrust of paediatric care. Conclusions Being wrongly accused of child abuse and alleged SBS/AHT evoked emotions of intense stress, but parents endured because of a successful fight to regain custody of their child. However, the trauma had a long-term impact on their lives with residual posttraumatic stress symptoms and mistrust towards healthcare services and the authorities. The results provide important inferences for restoring system failures within child protection services."
https://openalex.org/W3007127375,"Sperm motility is a crucial factor for normal fertilisation that is partly supported by mitochondrial activity. Enzymatic biofuel cells (EBFCs) generate electric currents by an electron grade from anodic to cathodic electrodes in a culture media. We demonstrate that electrical stimulation by EBFC at the nano-Ampere range enhances sperm motility that can potentially allow the development of a new therapeutic tool for male infertility, including poor motility. EBFC was set up with three different electrical currents (112 nA/cm2 and 250 nA/cm2) at two different times (1 h, 2 h). Each sample was evaluated for its motility by computer-assisted sperm analyses and sperm viability testing. In the expanded study, we used the optimal electrical current of the EBFC system to treat asthenozoospermia and sperm with 0% motility. Results showed that optimal electrical stimulation schemes with EBFCs enhanced sperm motility by 30-40% compared with controls. Activated spermatozoa led to tyrosine phosphorylation in the tail area of the sperm following the electrical stimulation in the nano-Ampere range. However, the electrically stimulated group did not exhibit increased acrosomal reaction rates compared with the control group. In cases related to asthenozoospermia, 40% of motility was recovered following the electrical stimulation at the nano-Ampere range. However, motility is not recovered in sperm with 0% motility. In conclusion, we found that sperm motility was enhanced by exposure to electrical currents in the nano-Ampere range induced by optimal EBFCs. Electrical stimulation enhanced the motility of the sperm though tyrosine phosphorylation in spermatozoa. Therefore, our results show that electrical currents in the nano-Ampere range can be potentially applied to male infertility therapy as enhancers of sperm motility in assisted reproductive technology."
https://openalex.org/W3006976811,"Implementing new diagnostics in public health programs can involve difficult trade-off decisions between individual patient benefits and public health considerations. Such decision-making processes are often not documented and may not include engagement of affected communities. This paper examines the perspectives of stakeholders on the trade-off between over-treatment and missed diagnosis captured during decision-making workshops on the transition from use of Xpert MTB/RIF to diagnose tuberculosis to Xpert MTB/RIF Ultra in Kenya and Swaziland. Xpert MTB/RIF Ultra has an overall increase in sensitivity but a decrease in specificity when compared to its predecessor. We conducted a qualitative study using four focus group discussions with a total of 47 participants and non-participant observation. The analysis reveals how participants deemed Xpert MTB/RIF Ultra's reduced specificity vis-à-vis its increased sensitivity to be an acceptable trade-off. The way participants assessed this trade-off was shaped by their experiences with the general uncertainty of all diagnostic tests, alternative testing options, historical evolution of diagnostic practices, epidemiological factors and resource constraints. In assessing the trade-off community and individual benefit and harm was frequently discussed together. Qualitative research on stakeholder engagement activities for diagnostic development and implementation can identify everyday experiences and situate assessments and perspectives of key stakeholders and as such aid in decision-making, improving implementation as well as patient outcomes. Further research is needed on the intended and unintended consequences of such engagement activities, how findings are being incorporated by decision-makers, and the impact on programmatic implementation."
