Here we introduce a physical mechanism to perform machine learning by demonstrating an all-optical diffractive deep neural network (D2NN) architecture that can implement various functions following the deep learning-based design of passive diffractive layers that work collectively. We created 3D-printed D2NNs that implement classification of images of handwritten digits and fashion products, as well as the function of an imaging lens at a terahertz spectrum. Our all-optical deep learning framework can perform, at the speed of light, various complex functions that computer-based neural networks can execute; will find applications in all-optical image analysis, feature detection, and object classification; and will also enable new camera designs and optical components that perform distinctive tasks using D2NNs."

Hu et al. show that a simple cerium salt paired with an alcohol can catalytically transform these and other simple hydrocarbons into reactive radicals at room temperature (see the Perspective by Kanai). The reactions rely on light to photolytically cleave cerium alkoxide bonds, producing alkoxy radicals that strip H atoms from the hydrocarbons and regenerate the alcohol.

Regulation of gene expression in response to stressful stimuli under healthy or pathological conditions involves epigenetic mechanisms such as DNA methylation and chromatin modifications (de Kloet et al., 2005de Kloet E.R.

Elucidating the underlying molecular processes that regulate the fine-tuned transcriptional response to stress is essential for understanding stress vulnerability and the development of stress-related psychiatric disorders such as depression and anxiety. In analogy to DNA modifications, a diverse set of covalent modifications is present on RNA nucleotides encoding the epitranscriptome, post-transcriptionally shaping gene expression via regulation of RNA stability, translation, and non-coding transcript function (Zhao et al., 2017Zhao B.S. Roundtree I.A. He C. Post-transcriptional gene regulation by mRNA modifications.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2017; 18: 31-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (1100) Google Scholar). The role of this newly emerging layer of gene expression control in the central stress response and behavior is not fully understood yet (Engel and Chen, 2018Engel M. Chen A. The emerging role of mRNA methylation in normal and pathological behavior.Genes Brain Behav. 2018; 17: e12428Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). RNA modifications, next to epigenetic mechanisms, likely represent a yet undescribed level of transcriptional regulation highly relevant for psychiatry. N6-methyladenosine (m6A) is the most abundant internal mRNA modification, which is present transcriptome-wide in at least one-fourth of all RNAs, typically located in a consensus motif (DRACH/GGACU), and enriched near stop codons and in 5′ UTRs (Dominissini et al., 2012Dominissini D.

Cell. 2013; 49: 18-29Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1858) Google Scholar). FTO further catalyzes the demethylation of N6,2′-O-dimethyladenosine (m6Am) with an in vitro preference for this substrate (Mauer et al., 2017Mauer J. Luo X. Blanjoie A. Jiao X. Grozhik A.V.

Chen Q. et al.Reversible methylation of m6Am in the 5′ cap controls mRNA stability.Nature. 2017; 541: 371-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (606) Google Scholar). m6Am is found at the first nucleotide adjacent to the 7-methylguanosine cap, promoting transcript stability (Mauer et al., 2017Mauer J.

Neurosci. 2013; 16: 1042-1048Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). The most commonly used m6A/m antibody, used also in most experiments presented here, co-detects m6A and m6Am (Linder et al., 2015Linder B. Grozhik A.V. Olarerin-George A.O. Meydan C. Mason C.E. Jaffrey S.R. Single-nucleotide-resolution mapping of m6A and m6Am throughout the transcriptome.Nat. Methods. 2015; 12: 767-772Crossref PubMed Scopus (828) Google Scholar), potentially preventing clear discrimination between them. Therefore, data will be treated as potentially containing both and called m6A/m unless otherwise stated. In general, m6A/m-regulating enzymes may be expressed at different levels in different cell types and have distinct intracellular distributions and binding motifs and thus potentially affect different subsets of target RNAs. Cellular consequences of m6A/m modifications depend on the binding of m6A/m-reader proteins (such as YTH and HNRNP proteins) and include RNA maturation, splicing, alternative polyadenylation, RNA decay, and both promotion and inhibition of protein translation (reviewed in Peer et al., 2017Peer E.

Dynamic RNA modifications in gene expression regulation.Cell. 2017; 169: 1187-1200Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1447) Google Scholar). In this study, we aimed to elucidate the role of m6A/m in the context of the brain’s stress response. We delineated the effects of acute stress on m6A/m using global m6A/m measurements, m6A/m sequencing (m6A/m-seq), and absolute quantification of transcript-specific methylation levels. In addition, we explored the functional significance of m6A/m in the adult brain by examining conditional knockout (cKO) mice for Mettl3 and Fto. Finally, we investigated m6A/m regulation in blood samples of mice and humans to determine its potential as a peripheral indicator of the central response to stress and stress-linked psychiatric disorders. To test whether acute stress alters m6A/m, we performed m6A/m-seq (RNA-seq after immunoprecipitation) on mouse cortex poly(A)-RNA 4 hr following 15 min of acute restraint stress exposure (n = 6–7). Using more specific areas, and thus lower amounts of input material, was not sufficient for consistent, quantifiable poly(A)-m6A/m-seq. The peaks enriched in the m6A/m-RIP (RNA immunoprecipitation)-seq over the input-RNA-seq in the two different conditions were very similar (Figures S1A and S1B). We analyzed differential methylation across an m6A/m consensus peak set with 14,656 high-confidence m6A/m peaks (supported by either 2/3 samples per group or 1/2 of all samples and additional abundance filters) mapping to 7,982 genes (Figure 1A; Table S1). Thus, around half of the expressed genes in the mouse cortex are m6A/m methylated with each around 2 peaks per gene (Figure 1A). m6A/m peaks overlapped majorly with previously reported m6A/m peaks (85% overlap with RMBase 2; Xuan et al., 2018Xuan J.-J. Sun W.-J. Lin P.-H. Zhou K.-R. Liu S. Zheng L.-L. Qu L.-H. Yang J.-H. RMBase v2.0: deciphering the map of RNA modifications from epitranscriptome sequencing data.Nucleic Acids Res. 2018; 46: D327-D334Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar), preferentially located to the 5′ UTR and around the stop codon (Figure 1B), and contained the m6A consensus motif with the top motif being a centrally enriched GGACWB (Figure 1C). m6A/m methylation in the cortex is overrepresented in genes involved in synaptic and neuronal regulation (Figure S1C). Only 25 m6A/m peaks (in 20 different genes) and 13 genes were found to be significantly regulated 4 hr after stress, but all with very low fold changes (at absolute log2 fold change > 0.2 for m6A, > 0.1 for RNA, and Q < 0.1; Figures 1A and S1D–S1G; two examples including validation by m6A-RIP-qPCR are shown in Figure 1D), potentially reflecting the cellular heterogeneity of the input material used diluting the cell-specific effects of stress. RNAs and m6A/m peaks significantly regulated by stress showed only low overlap (three genes) and no prominent correlation of m6A/m and gene expression regulation by stress (Figure S1E). To investigate if m6A and m6Am may have different effects after stress, we in silico dissected m6A and m6Am peaks based on the assumption that m6Am occurred at the first nucleotide after the transcription start site (similar to strategies employed earlier by Linder et al., 2015Linder B. Grozhik A.V. Olarerin-George A.O. Meydan C. Mason C.E. Jaffrey S.R. Single-nucleotide-resolution mapping of m6A and m6Am throughout the transcriptome.Nat. Methods. 2015; 12: 767-772Crossref PubMed Scopus (828) Google Scholar and Mauer et al., 2017Mauer J. Luo X. Blanjoie A. Jiao X. Grozhik A.V. Patil D.P. Linder B. Pickering B.F. Vasseur J.-J. Chen Q. et al.Reversible methylation of m6Am in the 5′ cap controls mRNA stability.Nature. 2017; 541: 371-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (606) Google Scholar). We observed 1,801 putative m6Am peaks (12%; Figures 1E and S2A) with highest gene ontology enrichment in developmental genes and genes related to DNA and RNA rather than neuronal genes (Figure S2B) and no enrichment of a GGAC motif (data not shown). Putative m6Am peaks were not overrepresented in stress-regulated peaks (data not shown), and had similar stress regulation like all peaks (Figure S2C) and similar absence of correlation to stress regulation of gene expression (Figure S2C), overall not indicating a special role of m6Am in the stress response. Further, in order to assess potential regulation of transcript translation by stress-regulated m6A/m, we performed ribosome profiling on mouse cortex 4 hr after stress. Although there were several genes with regulated translation efficiency after stress (24 genes at Q < 0.1, absolute log2 fold changes > 0.5), none overlapped with stress-regulated m6A/m and there was also no apparent relation to stress regulation of m6A/m (Figure 1F). Finally, searching for potential binding factors for m6A/m, we analyzed the co-occurrence of the overserved m6A motif GGACWB to known binding motifs of RNA-binding proteins in the m6A/m-seq fragments, observing a high similarity and summit enrichment to the binding motifs of FMRP/FMR1 and FXR2, proteins crucial for translation regulation, RNA translocation, and synaptic plasticity in neurons (Figure S2D). Likewise, genes reported to be bound by mouse FMRP were also higher than likely m6A/m methylated (Figure S2E), suggesting that m6A/m methylation of neuronal RNAs may regulate protein binding critical for neuronal transport and plasticity. Based on both the number of significantly stress-regulated m6A/m peaks and their respective fold changes in m6A/m-seq being very small, we reasoned that the true extent of the m6A/m stress response may only be revealed when investigating more defined brain regions. Therefore, we measured the time course of RNA methylation changes in two regions highly involved in stress response regulation: the medial prefrontal cortex (PFC) and the basolateral and central amygdala (AMY; Figure 2A). We found that global m6A/m was regulated in total RNA in a region-dependent manner with RNA methylation decreased in the PFC and increased in the AMY (Figure 2B). The same regulation was observed when only m6A was measured in mRNA using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) (Figure 2C), arguing for m6A as the main driver of the observed effects. Examining changes of the m6A/m machinery related to these global changes, we measured gene expression levels of m6A/m enzymes and binding proteins. We found the demethylases Fto and Alkbh5 to be differentially regulated in a region-specific manner, facilitating the effects observed on global methylation, in most cases preceding the effect observed on global m6A/m (Figure 2D). Furthermore, Mettl3 was downregulated upon stress exposure tissue independently (Figure 2D) and Wtap was regulated isoform specifically only in the AMY (Figure S3A). The m6A/m reader Ythdc1 was regulated in a region-specific manner (Figure 2D), whereas the other known enzymes and readers were not differentially expressed (Figure S3A). Notably, intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection of the endogenous glucocorticoid corticosterone, but not the glucocorticoid receptor agonist dexamethasone, changed global m6A/m (Figure 2E), as well as Fto and Alkbh5 expression (Figure S3B), similarly to acute stress (Figure 2D), demonstrating that the stress effect may be mediated by endogenous glucocorticoids (GCs). Supporting this idea, we found that the majority of m6A/m enzyme and reader genes contain several GC response elements in their 5′ upstream region, likewise pointing at expression regulation of those genes via GCs (Figure S3C). m6A/m-seq not only requires large amounts of input material but also does not quantify absolute transcript methylation. Therefore, we performed m6A/m-RIP followed by qPCR to assess absolute levels of candidate transcript methylation in narrowly defined brain areas, before and after stressful challenge. For calibration of the assay and normalization of immunoprecipitation efficiency in experiments, we designed and used an m6A/m-methylated internal spike-in RNA oligonucleotide (Figures 3A, S4A, and S4B). The m6A/m-RIP-qPCR detected m6A/m methylated RNA spike-in across a wide range of concentrations with low IgG background signal and without competing with the immunoprecipitation of endogenously methylated RNAs (Figure 3B). Using mixtures of unmethylated and methylated spike-in oligonucleotides, we confirmed that m6A/m-RIP-qPCR measured different methylation states of RNAs with high precision (Figure 3C; r2 > 0.95). Applying m6A/m-RIP-qPCR, we measured absolute methylation levels of several candidate transcripts involved in the brain’s stress response and, given the enrichment of neuronal plasticity and morphogenesis-related terms in the m6A/m-seq, synaptic plasticity-related transcripts (Figures 3D and S4C). Regulation of m6A/m by stress (26/44 transcripts) was observed more often than regulation of RNA (16/44 transcripts, with 12 overlapping) in the transcripts tested. Notably, the majority of chosen candidates were either regulated or expressed in a region-specific manner, emphasizing the importance of assessing RNA methylation in defined brain areas (Figure 3E). Interestingly, in contrast to the m6A/m-seq, absolute transcript methylation levels m6A/m and RNA fold changes negatively correlated, arguing for increased m6A/m levels correlating with mRNA decay as previously shown in vitro (Figure 3F; Table S2; with no influence of region and time point). In detail, both PFC and AMY exhibited differential response at 1 and 4 hr with opposite directions, paralleling the regulation observed in global m6A/m in the respective regions above (Figure 2B). Overall, 4 hr fold changes had higher effect sizes compared to 1 hr fold changes (Figure 3G). Fold changes at the 1 hr time point correlated with those at 4 hr for the same gene in the PFC, but not in the AMY, indicating that in the PFC 1 hr m6A/m may be an intermediate state of 4 hr regulation with fold changes of regulated m6A/m increasing with time. In contrast, in the AMY for the candidate genes investigated, m6A/m regulation after 1 and 4 hr was more independent (Figure 3H). Since the expression of the m6A methyltransferase Mettl3 and the m6A/m demethylase Fto was affected by acute stress, we generated cKO mouse models lacking these genes specifically in adult excitatory neurons employing Mettl3 or Fto flox/flox mice bred to Cre-driver lines. First, to measure the regulation of the epitranscriptome in these mice, we used the Camk2a-Cre driver, which induces gene deletion in excitatory neurons of neocortex and hippocampus (Minichiello et al., 1999Minichiello L. Korte M. Wolfer D. Kühn R. Unsicker K. Cestari V. Rossi-Arnaud C. Lipp H.-P. Bonhoeffer T. Klein R.

Schweizer M. Kuehne C. Ehrenberg S. Thoeringer C. Vogl A.M. Dedic N. Schumacher M. von Wolff G. Avrabos C. et al.Glutamatergic and dopaminergic neurons mediate anxiogenic and anxiolytic effects of CRHR1.Science. 2011; 333: 1903-1907Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar), leading to broad reductions of both Mettl3 and Fto mRNA and METTL3 and FTO protein in the adult brain (Figures 4A, 4B, and S5A). Whereas global m6A measured by LC-MS/MS was decreased in cortical mRNA of Mettl3 cKOs (compared to their respective Mettl3 wild-type [WT] littermates), conditional deletion of Fto did not alter m6A (Figures 4C and S5B). However, using an LC-MS/MS mRNA preparation including a cap-digest similar to previously published protocols (Mauer et al., 2017Mauer J. Luo X. Blanjoie A. Jiao X. Grozhik A.V. Patil D.P. Linder B. Pickering B.F. Vasseur J.-J. Chen Q. et al.Reversible methylation of m6Am in the 5′ cap controls mRNA stability.Nature. 2017; 541: 371-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (606) Google Scholar), we found that m6Am is increased in Fto cKO (Figure 4D; significantly increased both relative to Am or A with no change in Am; data not shown). These data confirm FTO primarily targeting m6Am in the adult brain in vivo (Mauer et al., 2017Mauer J. Luo X. Blanjoie A. Jiao X. Grozhik A.V. Patil D.P. Linder B. Pickering B.F. Vasseur J.-J. Chen Q. et al.Reversible methylation of m6Am in the 5′ cap controls mRNA stability.Nature. 2017; 541: 371-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (606) Google Scholar). m6Am and Am were below quantification threshold in all of the Mettl3 cKOs, but not Mettl3 WT animals (data not shown), potentially indicating an effect of METTL3 depletion on those nucleosides that should be confirmed with a more sensitive method. Absolute abundancies measured by LC-MS/MS in cortical mRNA were 0.304% for m6A/A, 0.022% for m6Am/A, and 0.071% for m6Am/m6A. m1A could not be detected in sufficient amounts for quantification in any of the samples (data not shown). We next profiled m6A/m in Mettl3 cKO and Fto cKO mice using m6A/m-seq on cortical poly(A)-RNA. Overall, m6A/m peaks detected in the single groups were still fairly similar (Figures S5C and S5D), with 80% overlap with the m6A/m dataset generated after acute stress (Figures S5D and S5E; mainly lacking 5′ UTR peaks potentially due to use of a different antibody lot). Quantitative analysis of consensus peaks revealed majorly altered epitranscriptomes in both mouse lines (Figures 4E and 4G; Table S3), with much higher numbers of consensus m6A/m peaks quantitatively altered in Mettl3 cKO compared to WT (1,266) compared to Fto cKO compared to WT (78; both Q < 0.1 and absolute log2 fold change > 0.5), and only a small number shared differentially methylated sites (Figure S5F). Although several RNAs are differentially expressed in Metltl3 cKOs or Fto cKOs, they only minorly overlapped with the regulated m6A/m peaks in the respective line (Figure S5F). Peaks differentially methylated in Mettl3 cKOs and Fto cKOs both showed higher enrichment at the 5′ UTR compared to all measured peaks (Figure 4F). Interestingly, Fto cKO differential peaks do not only localize to the 5′ UTR, as would be expected from m6Am sites only, but also to internal sites, arguing for Fto deletion also affecting internal m6A sites. Functionally, while m6A/m peaks are enriched in genes related to (mature) synapse and neuronal function, Mettl3 differential m6A peaks are more abundant in genes with neuronal and tissue-developmental functions (Figure S5G). To assess behavioral and electrophysiological consequences of Mettl3 and Fto deletion in vivo, we created cKO mice with a more defined gene deletion by breeding Mettl3 or Fto flox/flox mice to Nex-CreERT2 mice in which additionally the gene deletion can be timely controlled by tamoxifen (Agarwal et al., 2012Agarwal A. Dibaj P. Kassmann C.M. Goebbels S. Nave K.-A. Schwab M.H. In vivo imaging and noninvasive ablation of pyramidal neurons in adult NEX-CreERT2 mice.Cereb. Cortex. 2012; 22: 1473-1486Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar; Mettl3 cKO and Fto cKO). Upon induction in young adults, Mettl3 and Fto mRNA were depleted from both dorsal and ventral parts of the hippocampus, specifically in CA1 and CA3, but not in the dentate gyrus (Figure 5A). METTL3 and FTO proteins were significantly reduced in dCA1/dCA3 in Mettl3 cKO and Fto cKO mice, respectively (Figures 5B and S6A). Nex-CreERT2-induced recombination is further known to occur in small populations of principal neurons in the cortex (Agarwal et al., 2012Agarwal A. Dibaj P. Kassmann C.M. Goebbels S. Nave K.-A. Schwab M.H. In vivo imaging and noninvasive ablation of pyramidal neurons in adult NEX-CreERT2 mice.Cereb. Cortex. 2012; 22: 1473-1486Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Depletion of either gene did not result in compensatory changes of gene expression of other genes involved in m6A/m metabolism (Figure S6B) but altered transcriptome profiles as observed by mRNA-seq of CA1 and CA3 tissue (Figure 5C). Interestingly, in non-stressed basal animals, we observed a larger number of differentially expressed genes in Mettl3 cKOs compared to Fto cKOs (Figures 5B and 5C; Mettl3 cKOs, 84 differentially expressed genes; Fto cKOs, 15 differentially expressed genes with Q < 0.1 and an absolute fold change above log2 = 0.5; Table S4), with no apparent preference for up- or downregulation. Although there was only small overlap of differentially expressed genes between the two lines, 104 genes were differentially expressed in a knockout-specific pattern (Figure 5C), including genes regulating neuronal activity and synaptic function (examples shown Figure 5D). Neither Mettl3 cKO nor Fto cKO mice showed altered anxiety-like behavior or locomotion (Figure S7A), but we observed significant changes in spontaneous digging behavior (Figure S7A). Both knockout mice exhibited increased cued fear memory long-term maintained during memory extinction (Figure 6A) as well as contextual fear memory in Fto cKO mice (Figure 6A), but no differences in non-fear-related memory or"

https://openalex.org/W2810174843,"The development of complex in vitro hepatic systems and artificial liver devices has been hampered by the lack of reliable sources for relevant cell types, such as hepatic stellate cells (HSCs). Here we report efficient differentiation of human pluripotent stem cells into HSC-like cells (iPSC-HSCs). iPSC-HSCs closely resemble primary human HSCs at the transcriptional, cellular, and functional levels and possess a gene expression profile intermediate between that of quiescent and activated HSCs. Functional analyses revealed that iPSC-HSCs accumulate retinyl esters in lipid droplets and are activated in response to mediators of wound healing, similar to their in vivo counterparts. When maintained as 3D spheroids with HepaRG hepatocytes, iPSC-HSCs exhibit a quiescent phenotype but mount a fibrogenic response and secrete pro-collagen in response to known stimuli and hepatocyte toxicity. Thus, this protocol provides a robust in vitro system for studying HSC development, modeling liver fibrosis, and drug toxicity screening."
https://openalex.org/W2883738174,"Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is a monogenic disorder caused by loss of function mutations in the survival motor neuron 1 gene, which results in a broad range of disease severity, from neonatal to adult onset. There is currently a concerted effort to define the natural history of the disease and develop outcome measures that accurately capture its complexity. As several therapeutic strategies are currently under investigation and both the FDA and EMA have recently approved the first medical treatment for SMA, there is a critical need to identify the right association of responsive outcome measures and biomarkers for individual patient follow-up. As an approved treatment becomes available, untreated patients will soon become rare, further intensifying the need for a rapid, prospective and longitudinal study of the natural history of SMA Type 2 and 3. Here we present the baseline assessments of 81 patients aged 2 to 30 years of which 19 are non-sitter SMA Type 2, 34 are sitter SMA Type 2, 9 non-ambulant SMA Type 3 and 19 ambulant SMA Type 3. Collecting these data at nine sites in France, Germany and Belgium established the feasibility of gathering consistent data from numerous and demanding assessments in a multicenter SMA study. Most assessments discriminated between the four groups well. This included the Motor Function Measure (MFM), pulmonary function testing, strength, electroneuromyography, muscle imaging and workspace volume. Additionally, all of the assessments showed good correlation with the MFM score. As the untreated patient population decreases, having reliable and valid multi-site data will be imperative for recruitment in clinical trials. The pending two-year study results will evaluate the sensitivity of the studied outcomes and biomarkers to disease progression. Trial Registration: ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT02391831)."
https://openalex.org/W2883075826,"Despite the growing adoption of the mobile health (mHealth) applications (apps), few studies address concerns with low retention rates. This study aimed to investigate how the usage patterns of mHealth app functions affect user retention. We collected individual usage logs for 1,439 users of single tethered personal health record app, which spanned an 18-months period from August 2011 to January 2013. The user logs contained timestamps whenever an individual uses each function, which enables us to identify the usage patterns based on the intensity of using a particular function in the app. We then estimated how these patterns were related to 1) the app usage over time (using the random effect model) and 2) the probability of stopping the use of the application (using the Cox proportional hazard model). The analyses suggested that the users utilize the app most at the time of the adoption and gradually reduce their usage over time. The average duration of use after starting the app was 25.62 weeks (SD: 18.41). The degree of the usage reduction, however, decreases as the self-monitoring function is more frequently used (coefficient = 0.002, P = 0.013); none of the other functions has this effect. Moreover, engaging with the self-monitoring function frequently (coefficient = -0.18, P = 0.003) and regularly (coefficient = 0.10, P = 0.001) significantly also reduces the probability of abandoning the application. Specifically, the estimated survival rate indicates that, after 40 weeks since the adoption, the probability of the regular users of self-monitoring to stay in use was about 80% while that of non-user was about 60%. This study provides the empirical evidence that sustained use of mHealth app is closely linked to the regular usage on self-monitoring function. The implications can be extended to the education of users and physicians to produce better outcomes as well as application development for effective user interfaces."

Restricting FODMAP intake is believed to relieve colonic distension by reducing colonic fermentation but this has not been previously directly assessed. We performed a randomised controlled trial comparing the effect of a low FODMAP diet combined with either maltodextrin or oligofructose on colonic contents, metabolites and microbiota. Methods A parallel randomised controlled trial in healthy adults (n = 37). All subjects followed a low FODMAP diet for a week and supplemented their diet with either maltodextrin (MD) or oligofructose (OF) 7g twice daily. Fasted assessments performed pre- and post-diet included MRI to assess colonic volume, breath testing for hydrogen and methane, and stool collection for microbiota analysis. Results The low FODMAP diet was associated with a reduction in Bifidobacterium and breath hydrogen, which was reversed by oligofructose supplementation. The difference in breath hydrogen between groups post-intervention was 27ppm (95% CI 7 to 50, P<0.01). Colonic volume increased significantly from baseline in both groups (OF increased 110ml (19.6%), 95% CI 30ml to 190ml, P = 0.01; MD increased 90ml (15.5%), 95% CI 6ml to 175ml, P = 0.04) with no significant difference between them. Colonic volumes correlated with total breath hydrogen + methane. A divergence in Clostridiales abundance was observed with increased abundance of Ruminococcaceae in the maltodextrin group, while in the oligofructose group, Lachnospiraceae decreased. Subjects in either group with high methane production also tended to have high microbial diversity, high colonic volume and greater abundance of methanogens. Conclusion A low FODMAP diet reduces total bacterial count and gas production with little effect on colonic volume."
https://openalex.org/W2884779127,"The capacity to rapidly generate and apply a great amount of force seems to play a key role in sprint running. However, it has recently been shown that, for sprinters, the technical ability to effectively orient the force onto the ground is more important than its total amount. The force-vector theory has been proposed to guide coaches in selecting the most adequate exercises to comprehensively develop the neuromechanical qualities related to the distinct phases of sprinting. This study aimed to compare the relationships between vertically-directed (loaded and unloaded vertical jumps, and half-squat) and horizontally-directed (hip-thrust) exercises and the sprint performance of top-level track and field athletes. Sixteen sprinters and jumpers (including three Olympic athletes) executed vertical jumps, loaded jump squats and hip-thrusts, and sprinting speed tests at 10-, 20-, 40-, 60-, 100-, and 150-m. Results indicated that the hip-thrust is more associated with the maximum acceleration phase (i.e., from zero to 10-m; r = 0.93), whereas the loaded and unloaded vertical jumps seem to be more related to top-speed phases (i.e., distances superior to 40-m; r varying from 0.88 to 0.96). These findings reinforce the mechanical concepts supporting the force-vector theory, and provide coaches and sport scientists with valuable information about the potential use and benefits of using vertically- or horizontally-based training exercises."

In a sample of 398 Facebook users (age: M (SD) = 33.01 (11.23), range: 18–64), the significant positive association between Facebook flow and FAD was positively moderated by the intensity of Facebook use. Exploratory factor analysis revealed that all six items assessing FAD loaded on the same factor as two items belonging to the subscale telepresence of Facebook flow. Therefore, the close link between Facebook flow and FAD may in particular result from the immersion in an attractive online world created by Facebook, where users escape to forget their everyday obligations and problems.

Tooth extraction after starting medication has been believed to be a major risk factor for MRONJ, and therefore this procedure tends to be avoided. This study investigated the risk factors for MRONJ, with a special reference to the correlation between tooth extraction and development of MRONJ. One hundred and thirty-five cancer patients who were administrated high-dose BP or Dmab were enrolled in the study. Demographic factors, general condition, treatment factors, and dental findings were examined retrospectively using medical records and panoramic X-ray findings. The cumulative occurrence rate of MRONJ was calculated using the Kaplan–Meier method, and the correlation between these variables and development of MRONJ was analyzed by univariate and multivariate Cox regression analysis. MRONJ developed in 18 of 135 patients. The 1-, 2-, and 3-year cumulative occurrence rates were 8.6%, 21.5%, and 29.2%, respectively. The duration of medication before first visit to the dental unit and the presence of a tooth with clinical symptoms were significantly correlated with the development of MRONJ. The rate of MRONJ occurrence in patients who had teeth with clinical symptoms, but who did not undergo tooth extraction, became higher 2 years later than that in patients who underwent extraction of teeth with symptoms, although not significant. Early dental examination and effective preventative care to avoid infection/inflammation are important for preventing MRONJ."

Methods We prospectively evaluated changes in endothelial cell density (ECD) in the cornea of 59 patients (59 eyes) who underwent Baerveldt glaucoma implantation. Tubes were inserted into the anterior chamber in 45 eyes and pars plana in 14 eyes. The primary outcome measure was the change in corneal ECD after Baerveldt glaucoma implantation. Secondary outcome measures included relationships between corneal ECD and optical coherence tomography images of tube parameters (tube–cornea distance and tube–cornea angle) and prognostic factors for corneal ECD loss. Results Corneal ECD decreased significantly by 9.2% at 12 months after surgery (P = 0.001). In the anterior chamber Baerveldt glaucoma implantation group, corneal ECD at the tube insertion quadrant decreased significantly by 9.6% at 3 months (P = <0.001), 10.7% at 6 months (P = <0.001), and 13.1% at 12 months (P = <0.001). Corneal ECD at the center decreased significantly at 6 months after surgery (7.2% loss; P = 0.012) and at 12 months after surgery (12.1% loss; P = 0.001). Corneal ECD at the contralateral quadrant decreased significantly at 12 months after surgery only (10.3% loss; P = 0.004). In the pars plana Baerveldt glaucoma implantation group, no significant loss of corneal ECD was found in any corneal areas at any post-surgery follow-up visits. Tube-cornea angle was negatively correlated with the rate of corneal ECD loss at the tube insertion quadrant; r = −0.55 (P = 0.0013). In multivariable analyses, exfoliation glaucoma and narrower tube–cornea angle were significant prognostic factors for severe corneal ECD loss (P = 0.0068 and P = 0.046, respectively). Conclusions Anterior chamber Baerveldt glaucoma implantation causes corneal endothelial cell loss. Corneal endothelial cell loss starts at the tube insertion quadrant. Exfoliation glaucoma and narrower tube-corneal angle are associated with severe loss of corneal endothelial cells."

Based on the severity of birth defects the extent of impairment in these infants is expected to be profound; however, virtually nothing is known regarding the developmental and behavioral sequela of congenital Zika syndrome. This pilot study collected parent-reported patterns of development and sleep in 47 infants with confirmed congenital Zika syndrome who are being followed for clinical services at the Altino Ventura Foundation (FAV) in Recife, Brazil. With assistance from clinicians at FAV, caregivers completed Brazilian Portuguese versions of the Ages and Stages Questionnaire, 3rd edition (ASQ-3) and the Brief Infant Sleep Questionnaire (BISQ). All infants were between 13–22 months of age at the time of the assessment. At 16 months of age, none of the children displayed age appropriate developmental skills. Most (~ 75%) mastered some communication and gross motor skills at around a 6–8-month level. Communication and gross motor skills were relative strengths for the sample, while problem-solving and fine motor skills were relative weaknesses. Sleep was noted to be a problem for around 18% of the sample. In utero exposure to the Zika virus will have lifelong consequences for affected children and their families. Understanding the developmental and behavioral trajectories of affected infants will help identify appropriate family supports to improve quality of life."
https://openalex.org/W2884194766,"Plants regulate responses to salt stress using biological pathways, such as signal perception and transduction, photosynthesis, and energy metabolism. Little is known about the genetics of salt tolerance in Rosa chinensis. Tineke and Hiogi are salt-tolerant and salt-sensitive varieties of R. chinensis, respectively, and are good choices for studying salt-tolerance genes. We studied leaf and root tissues from 1-year-old Hiogi and Tineke plants simultaneously grown under the same conditions. A 0.4%-mmol/L salt ion mixture was added to the basic growth medium. Illumina sequencing was used to identify differentially expressed transcripts. GO and KEGG pathway enrichment analyses were performed to identify differentially expressed genes. We identified many differentially expressed genes associated with salt tolerance. The abscisic acid-dependent signaling pathway was the main pathway that mediated the salt stress response in R. chinensis. Two pathways (plant hormone signal transduction and glutathione metabolism) were also active in salt stress responses in R. chinensis. The difference in salt tolerance in the cultivars was due to different gene sensitivity to salt in these two pathways. Roots also play a role in salt stress response. The effects of salt stress in the roots are eventually manifested in the leaves, causing changes in processes such as photosynthesis, which eventually result in leaf wilting. In Tineke, Snrk2, ABF, HSP, GSTs, and GSH1 showed high activity during salt stress, indicating that these genes are markers of salt tolerance."
https://openalex.org/W2883128787,"Vibrio cholerae O1, the etiological agent of cholera, is a natural inhabitant of aquatic ecosystems. Motility is a critical element for the colonization of both the human host and its environmental reservoirs. In this study, we investigated the molecular mechanisms underlying the chemotactic response of V. cholerae in the presence of some of its environmental reservoirs. We found that, from the several oligosaccharides found in mucin, two specifically triggered motility of V. cholerae O1: N-acetylneuraminic acid (Neu5Ac) and N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc). We determined that the compounds need to be internally catabolized in order to trigger motility of V. cholerae. Interestingly, the catabolism of Neu5Ac and GlcNAc converges and the production of one molecule common to both pathways, glucosamine-6-phosphate (GlcN-6P), is essential to induce motility in the presence of both compounds. Mutants unable to produce GlcN-6P show greatly reduced motility towards mucin. Furthermore, we determined that the production of GlcN-6P is necessary to induce motility of V. cholerae in the presence of some of its environmental reservoirs such as crustaceans or cyanobacteria, revealing a molecular link between the two distinct modes of the complex life cycle of V. cholerae. Finally, cross-species comparisons revealed varied chemotactic responses towards mucin, GlcNAc, and Neu5Ac for environmental (non-pathogenic) strains of V. cholerae, clinical and environmental isolates of the human pathogens Vibrio vulnificus and Vibrio parahaemolyticus, and fish and squid isolates of the symbiotic bacterium Vibrio fischeri. The data presented here suggest nuance in convergent strategies across species of the same bacterial family for motility towards suitable substrates for colonization."
https://openalex.org/W2884705665,"Post-diapause cysts of Artemia franciscana undergo a well-defined developmental process whereby internal differentiation leads to rupture of the cyst shell, release of membrane-enclosed nauplii and hatching to yield swimming larvae. The post-diapause development of A. franciscana has been examined at biochemical and molecular levels, yet little is known about molecular chaperone function during this process. In addressing this we recently described ArHsp40, a type 1 J-domain protein in post-diapause A. franciscana cysts and larvae. The current report describes ArHsp40-2, a second J-domain protein from A. franciscana. ArHsp40-2 is a type 2 J-domain protein, lacking a zinc binding domain but containing other domains characteristic of these proteins. Notably, ArHsp40-2 possesses a double barrel β-domain structure in its substrate binding region, as does ArHsp40. qPCR revealed a relatively low amount of ArHsp40-2 mRNA in 0 h cysts which increased significantly until the E1 stage, most likely as a result of enhanced transcription, after which it declined. An antibody specific to ArHsp40-2 was produced and used to show that like its mRNA, ArHsp40-2 accumulated until the E1 stage and then decreased to amounts lower than those in 0 h cysts. The synthesis of ArHsp40-2 was induced by heat shock indicating that ArHsp40-2 is involved in stress resistance in cysts and nauplii. Accumulation in cysts during early post-diapause development followed by its sharp decline suggests a role in protein disaggregation/refolding, a function of Hsp40s from other organisms, where ArHsp40-2 assists in the rescue of proteins sequestered during diapause by p26, an abundant small heat shock protein (sHsp) in A. franciscana cysts."
https://openalex.org/W2883022926,"Introduction Heart rate variability biofeedback (HRV-BFB) training, a method whereby one controls an unusually low breathing rate to reach cardiac coherence, has been shown to reduce anxiety and improve cardiac autonomic markers in diseased people, but much less is known about HRV-BFB benefits in healthy people. Here we investigated potential benefits in young competitors experiencing stress during university examinations as well as persistence of benefits after HRV-BFB training cessation. Methods A group of sports students (n = 12) practiced 5-min HRV-BFB training twice a day for 5-weeks using URGOfeel® (URGOTECH) and was compared to a control group (n = 6). University examinations occurred immediately after HRV-BFB training (Exam1), then 12-weeks later (Exam2). Anxiety markers and cardiac autonomic markers were assessed at baseline, Exam1 and Exam2. Principal Component Analyses (PCA) that combined all these markers were computed at Exam1 and Exam2 to emphasize covariations. Results At Exam 1, immediately after HRV-BFB training cessation, the experimental group demonstrated greater autonomic markers but similar states of anxiety when compared to the Control group. Twelve weeks later at Exam2, autonomic markers were greater and anxiety scores were lesser among the experimental group. PCA highlighted covariations only within cardiac autonomic markers at Exam1. Rather, variations in cardiac markers were associated with anxiety markers at Exam2. Conclusion Short sessions of HRV-BFB training for a brief period of 5 weeks bring substantial benefits to autonomic markers and anxiety levels in young competitors. Here beneficial effects persisted for 12 weeks. Dissociated profiles of anxiety and cardiac autonomic adaptations shed new light on the role of the amygdala in heart-brain interactions after cardiac coherence training."
https://openalex.org/W2883498130,"The static chamber approach is often used for greenhouse gas (GHG) flux measurements, whereby the flux is deduced from the increase of species concentration after closing the chamber. Since this increase changes diffusion gradients between chamber air and soil air, a nonlinear increase is expected. Lateral gas flow and leakages also contribute to non linearity. Several models have been suggested to account for this non linearity, the most recent being the Hutchinson–Mosier regression model (hmr). However, the practical application of these models is challenging because the researcher needs to decide for each flux whether a nonlinear fit is appropriate or exaggerates flux estimates due to measurement artifacts. In the latter case, a flux estimate from the linear model is a more robust solution and introduces less arbitrary uncertainty to the data. We present the new, dynamic and reproducible flux calculation scheme, kappa.max, for an improved trade-off between bias and uncertainty (i.e. accuracy and precision). We develop a tool to simulate, visualise and optimise the flux calculation scheme for any specific static N2O chamber measurement system. The decision procedure and visualisation tools are implemented in a package for the R software. Finally, we demonstrate with this approach the performance of the applied flux calculation scheme for a measured flux dataset to estimate the actual bias and uncertainty. The kappa.max method effectively improved the decision between linear and nonlinear flux estimates reducing the bias at a minimal cost of uncertainty."
https://openalex.org/W2883217840,"Background Anthropometric and reproductive factors have been reported as being established risk factors for breast cancer (BC). This study explores the contribution of anthropometric and reproductive factors in UK females developing BC in a large longitudinal cohort. Methods Data from the UK Biobank prospective study of 273,467 UK females were analyzed. Relative risks (RRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for each factor were adjusted for age, family history of BC and deprivation score. The analyses were stratified by the menopausal status. Results Over the 9 years of follow up the total number of BC cases were 14,231 with 3,378 (23.7%) incident cases with an incidence rate of 2.09 per 1000 person-years. In pre-menopausal, increase in age, height, having low BMI, low waist to hip ratio, first degree family history of BC, early menarche age, nulliparous, late age at first live birth, high reproductive interval index, and long contraceptive use duration were all significantly associated with an increased BC risk. In post-menopausal, getting older, being taller, having high BMI, first degree BC family history, nulliparous, late age at first live birth, and high reproductive interval index were all significantly associated with an increased risk of BC. The population attributable fraction (PAF) suggested that an early first live birth, lower reproductive interval index and increased number of children can contribute to BC risk reduction up to 50%. Conclusions This study utilizes the UK Biobank study to confirm associations between anthropometric and reproductive factors and the risk of breast cancer development. Result of attributable fraction of risk contributed by each risk factor suggested that lifetime risk of BC can be reduced by controlling weight, reassessing individual approaches to the timing of childbirth and options for contraception and considering early screening for women with family history in the first degree relative."
https://openalex.org/W2883335491,"Variations of free calcium concentration ([Ca2+]) are powerful intracellular signals, controlling contraction as well as metabolism in muscle cells. To fully understand the role of calcium redistribution upon excitation and contraction in skeletal muscle cells, the local [Ca2+] in different compartments needs to be taken into consideration. Fluorescent probes allow the determination of [Ca2+] in the cytosol where myofibrils are embedded, the lumen of the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) and the mitochondrial matrix. Previously, models have been developed describing intracellular calcium handling in skeletal and cardiac muscle cells. However, a comprehensive model describing the kinetics of the changes in free calcium concentration in these three compartments is lacking. We designed a new 3D compartmental model of the half sarcomere with radial symmetry, which accounts for diffusion of Ca2+ into the three compartments and simulates its dynamics at rest and at various rates of stimulation in mice skeletal muscle fibers. This model satisfactorily reproduces both the amplitude and time course of the variations of [Ca2+] in the three compartments in mouse fast fibers. As an illustration of the applicability of the model, we investigated the effects of Calsequestrin (CSQ) ablation. CSQ is the main Ca2+ buffer in the SR, localized in close proximity of its calcium release sites and near to the mitochondria. CSQ knock-out mice muscles still preserve a near-normal contractile behavior, but it is unclear whether this is caused by additional SR calcium buffering or a significant contribution of calcium entry from extracellular space, via stored-operated calcium entry (SOCE). The model enabled quantitative assessment of these two scenarios by comparison to measurements of local calcium in the cytosol, the SR and the mitochondria. In conclusion, the model represents a useful tool to investigate the impact of protein ablation and of pharmacological interventions on intracellular calcium dynamics in mice skeletal muscle."

Our sample includes male Wistar rats, 2 months old and weighing 250-300 g, that is categorized into three groups: control, sham, and experimental. The experimental group was anesthetized; the C6 cells with luciferase expression that were suspended in a culture medium were implanted into the right frontoparietal cortex of the rats. The sham group received implant only with culture medium without cells. Images and behavioral tests were evaluated at base time and at 7, 14, 21, and 28 days after induced tumor growth analysis. The tumor volume measured by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and quantitative bioluminescence imaging (BLI) signal showed a correlation coefficient of r = 0.96. The MRI showed that the mean tumor volume increased by approximately 10, 26, and 49 times according to a comparison of tumor volume on the seventh day with 14, 21, and 28 days, respectively. The quantification of the BLI signal was (4.12 ± 2.01) x 10(8), (8.33 ± 3.12) x 10(8), (28.43 ± 6.32) x 10(8), and (63.02 ± 10.53) x 10(8) photons/s at the seventh, fourteenth, twenty-first, and twenty-eighth day, respectively. After 14 days of tumor induction, both behavioral tests showed significant differences between tumor and sham or control groups.

In addition, functional behavioral analysis displayed sensitivity to monitor tumor growth, as well as to detect early significant changes between groups, primarily in the tumor group. The results of gait analysis were more sensitive than general motor analysis."
https://openalex.org/W2883600644,"Monitoring the instantaneous and changing concrete surface condition is paramount to cost-effectively managing tunnel assets. In practice, detecting cracks efficiently and accurately is a very challenging task due to concrete blebs, stains, and illumination over the concrete surface. Unclear and tiny cracks cannot be detected effectively. In this paper, we proposed an ultra-efficient crack detection algorithm (CrackHHP) and an improved pre-extraction and second percolation process based on the percolation model to address these issues. Our contributions are shown as follows: 1) apply the overlapping grids and weight-based, redefined pixel value to obtain the candidate dark pixel image while preserving the cracks. 2) introduce the second percolation processing to generate a high-accuracy crack detection algorithm, which can connect the tiny fractures and detect the tiny cracks. 3) construct a high-efficiency and high-accuracy crack detection algorithm combining the improved pre-extraction and the second percolation process. The experimental results demonstrate that CrackHHP can significantly improve the efficiency and accuracy of crack detection."
https://openalex.org/W2950203602,"We propose a mathematical and computational model that captures the stimulus-generated Ca2+ transients in the C. elegans ASH sensory neuron. The rationale is to develop a tool that will enable a cross-talk between modeling and experiments, using modeling results to guide targeted experimental efforts. The model is built based on biophysical events and molecular cascades known to unfold as part of neurons' Ca2+ homeostasis mechanism, as well as on Ca2+ signaling events. The state of ion channels is described by their probability of being activated or inactivated, and the remaining molecular states are based on biochemically defined kinetic equations or known biochemical motifs. We estimate the parameters of the model using experimental data of hyperosmotic stimulus-evoked Ca2+ transients detected with a FRET sensor in young and aged worms, unstressed and exposed to oxidative stress. We use a hybrid optimization method composed of a multi-objective genetic algorithm and nonlinear least-squares to estimate the model parameters. We first obtain the model parameters for young unstressed worms. Next, we use these values of the parameters as a starting point to identify the model parameters for stressed and aged worms. We show that the model, in combination with experimental data, corroborates literature results. In addition, we demonstrate that our model can be used to predict ASH response to complex combinations of stimulation pulses. The proposed model includes for the first time the ASH Ca2+ dynamics observed during both ""on"" and ""off"" responses. This mathematical and computational effort is the first to propose a dynamic model of the Ca2+ transients' mechanism in C. elegans neurons, based on biochemical pathways of the cell's Ca2+ homeostasis machinery. We believe that the proposed model can be used to further elucidate the Ca2+ dynamics of a key C. elegans neuron, to guide future experiments on C. elegans neurobiology, and to pave the way for the development of more mathematical models for neuronal Ca2+ dynamics."
https://openalex.org/W2883322888,"When living tissues are injured, they undergo a sequential process of homeostasis, inflammation, proliferation and maturation, which is called wound healing. The working mechanism of wound healing has not been wholly understood due to its complex environments with various mechanical and chemical factors. In this study, we propose a novel in vitro wound healing model using a microfluidic system that can manipulate the topography of the wound bed. The topography of the extracellular matrix (ECM) in the wound bed is one of the most important mechanical properties for rapid and effective wound healing. We focused our work on the topographical factor which is one of crucial mechanical cues in wound healing process by using various nano-patterns on the cell attachment surface. First, we analyzed the cell morphology and dynamic cellular behaviors of NIH-3T3 fibroblasts on the nano-patterned surface. Their morphology and dynamic behaviors were investigated for relevance with regard to the recovery function. Second, we developed a highly reproducible and inexpensive research platform for wound formation and the wound healing process by combining the nano-patterned surface and a microfluidic channel. The effect of topography on wound recovery performance was analyzed. This in vitro wound healing research platform will provide well-controlled topographic cue of wound bed and contribute to the study on the fundamental mechanism of wound healing."
https://openalex.org/W2884286428,"Thrombin and other inflammatory mediators may induce vascular permeability through the disruption of adherens junctions between adjacent endothelial cells. If uncontrolled, hyperpermeability leads to an impaired barrier, fluid leakage and edema, which can contribute to multi-organ failure and death. RhoGTPases control cytoskeletal dynamics, adhesion and migration and are known regulators of endothelial integrity. Knowledge of the precise role of each RhoGTPase, and their associated regulatory and effector genes, in endothelial integrity is incomplete. Using a combination of a RNAi screen with electrical impedance measurements, we quantified the effect of individually silencing 270 Rho-associated genes on the barrier function of thrombin-activated, primary endothelial cells. Known and novel RhoGTPase-associated regulators that modulate the response to thrombin were identified (RTKN, TIAM2, MLC1, ARPC1B, SEPT2, SLC9A3R1, RACGAP1, RAPGEF2, RHOD, PREX1, ARHGEF7, PLXNB2, ARHGAP45, SRGAP2, ARHGEF5). In conclusion, with this siRNA screen, we confirmed the roles of known regulators of endothelial integrity but also identified new, potential key players in thrombin-induced endothelial signaling."

Psychological stress in parents influences the level of adjustment to the illness of their children. The Pediatric Inventory for Parents (PIP) was designed to measure stress in parents whose child has a chronic illness or requires prolonged medical monitoring. The main objective of this study is to provide a brief version of the Spanish translation of the PIP, across a sample consisting of 465 main familial caregivers (85.2% female, n = 396) between 27 and 67 years old ( = 44.13; SD = 5.35) of paediatric patients between 9 and 18 years old ( = 12.10, SD = 2.20; 56.8% men, n = 264) diagnosed with diabetes mellitus type I (20.9% of the sample; n = 97), short stature (32.5% of the sample; n = 151), or a chronic respiratory disease (asthma, cystic fibrosis, bronchiolitis obliterans and bronchiectasis) (46.6% of the sample; n = 217). After performing several EFAs (Exploratory Factor Analyses) and CFAs (Confirmatory Factorial Analyses), it was decided that 30 items need to be removed. Reliability and validity results suggest that the new 12-item version possesses appropriate psychometric properties. Cronbach’s alpha value ranging between α = .42 and α = .81 and fit values obtained indicate a good fit: χ2/df (88.393/48) = 1.84 (α < .01); S-B χ2(df) = 88.393 (48); CFI = .95; IFI = .95; RMSEA = .05 (.033 - .074) for the frequency scales and χ2/df (72.002/48) = 1.5 (α < .01); S-Bχ2(df) = 72.002 (48); CFI = .97; IFI = .97; RMSEA = .04 (.011 - .063) for the difficulty scales. The PIP also showed predictive ability in regards to anxiety and depression, a positive relationship between the instrument's own scales and a negative relationship with the caregiver's age. Finally, depending on the paediatric patient's diagnosis, differences in stress levels were found."
https://openalex.org/W2883426966,"The incidence of abnormally invasive placentation (AIP) is increasing. Most of these pregnancies are delivered preterm. We sought to characterize neonatal outcomes in AIP pregnancies.In this retrospective case-control study (2006-2015), AIP neonates (n = 108) were matched to two controls each for gestational age, antenatal glucocorticoid exposure, sex, plurity, and delivery mode. Medical records were reviewed for neonatal and maternal characteristics/outcomes. Univariate and multivariate Poisson regressions were performed to determine relative risk ratios (RR).There were no mortalities. All neonatal outcomes were similar except for respiratory distress syndrome (RDS), which affected 37% of AIP neonates (versus 21% of controls). AIP neonates required respiratory support (64.8% vs. 51.9%) and continuous positive airway pressure (53.7% vs. 42.1%) for a longer duration. Univariate regression yielded elevated RRs for RDS for AIP (RR 1.78, 95% CI 1.24-2.54), placenta previa (RR = 1.94, 95% CI 1.36-2.76), and placenta previa with bleeding (RR 2.29, 95% CI 1.36-3.86). One episode of bleeding had a RR of 2.43 (95% CI 1.57-3.76), 2 or more episodes had a RR of 2.95 (95% CI 1.96-4.44), and bleeding/abruption as the delivery indication had a RR of 2.57 (95% CI 1.82-3.64). A multivariate regression stratifying for AIP and evaluating the combined and individual associations of AIP, bleeding, placenta previa, and GA, resulted in elevated RRs for placenta previa alone (RR 2.16, 95% CI 1.15-4.06) and placenta previa and bleeding (RR 1.69, 95% CI 1.001-2.85).The increased incidence of RDS at later gestational ages in AIP is driven by placenta previa. AIP neonates required respiratory support for a longer duration than age-matched controls. Providers should be prepared to counsel expectant parents and care for affected neonates."
https://openalex.org/W2883722946,"Cognitive-motor interference, a negative influence on the performance of one or both tasks, is manifested when simultaneously performing a cognitive and a motor task. Motor fatigue reduces the ability of generating a required force level. However, little is known about the effects of motor fatigue on the cognitive-motor dual-tasking performance, an important capability during our daily lives. This study investigated how motor fatigue affects dual-task walking performance. Eighteen healthy younger adults walked on a treadmill under three different conditions: walking only, walking while receiving the Paced Auditory Serial Addition Test (PASAT) or a modified Stroop test before and after a lower-extremity fatiguing exercise. We computed dynamic margins of stability (MOS), step and joint kinematic variability, and short-term local divergence exponent (LDE) of the trunk motion. We found that subjects had similar values of short-term LDE during all conditions, indicating that local stability was not affected by the motor fatigue or dual-task conditions. Compared to the baseline, subjects had significantly greater mean MOS after the fatiguing exercise by walking with greater step length and width while having significantly greater gait variability. In contrast, subjects walked with similar mean MOS but significantly less gait variability during the dual-task conditions, indicating that subjects used different adaptive strategies when walking with motor fatigue and during dual-task conditions. There were no significant differences in the number of errors for the two cognitive tests before and after the fatiguing exercise. The current findings demonstrate that motor fatigue does not affect cognitive but motor performance in younger adults."
https://openalex.org/W2883993939,"Periostin, which is induced by interleukin (IL)-13, is an extracellular matrix (ECM) protein that supports αMβ2 integrin-mediated adhesion and migration of IL-5-stimulated eosinophils. Transforming growth factor (TGF)-β-induced protein (TGFBI) is a widely expressed periostin paralog known to support monocyte adhesion. Our objective was to compare eosinophil adhesion and migration on TGFBI and periostin in the presence of IL-5-family cytokines. Eosinophil adhesion after 1 h and random motility over 20 h in the presence of various concentrations of IL-5, IL-3, or granulocyte macrophage-colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) were quantified in wells coated with various concentrations of TGFBI or periostin. Results were compared to video microscopy of eosinophils. Cytokine-stimulated eosinophils adhered equivalently well to TGFBI or periostin in a coating concentration-dependent manner. Adhesion was blocked by anti-αMβ2 and stimulated at the lowest concentration by GM-CSF. In the motility assay, periostin was more potent than TGFBI, the coating-concentration effect was bimodal, and IL-3 was the most potent cytokine. Video microscopy revealed that under the optimal coating condition of 5 μg/ml periostin, most eosinophils migrated persistently and were polarized and acorn-shaped with a ruffling forward edge and granules gathered together, in front of the nucleus. On 10 μg/ml periostin or TGFBI, more eosinophils adopted a flattened pancake morphology with dispersed granules and nuclear lobes, and slower migration. Conversion between acorn and pancake morphologies were observed. We conclude that TGFBI or periostin supports two modes of migration by IL-5 family cytokine-activated eosinophils. The rapid mode is favored by intermediate protein coatings and the slower by higher coating concentrations. We speculate that eosinophils move by haptotaxis up a gradient of adhesive ECM protein and then slow down to surveil the tissue."
https://openalex.org/W2884894454,"There is initial support for the effectiveness of approach-avoidance trainings in altering food-related health behaviors. Furthermore, outcome expectancies induced by verbal suggestions might optimize the effectiveness of these interventions, as shown in placebo research. The present study investigated the effectiveness of a gamified approach-avoidance training on food-related outcomes and whether verbal suggestions could strengthen those effects. A total of 120 participants were randomly assigned to 1 of 4 conditions: serious gaming only, verbal suggestions only, serious gaming combined with verbal suggestions, or a gaming control condition. Virtual food preference and food choice were assessed with a food choice task, with pairs differing in healthiness or in healthiness and attractiveness. Implicit food preference was assessed with an Implicit Association Test and food intake with a bogus taste test. Participants in both serious gaming conditions made healthier food choices for pairs differing in healthiness and attractiveness and had healthier implicit food preferences compared to gaming control. No effects were found on food intake. These findings provide the first preliminary support for the effects of a gamified approach-avoidance training on virtual food choice and implicit food preference. Future studies should further elucidate these effects, also in other health domains such as physical activity."
https://openalex.org/W2883386588,"Flaviviruses accumulate abundant subgenomic RNA (sfRNA) in infected cells. It has been reported that sfRNA results from stalling of host 5’-to-3’ exoribonuclease XRN1 at the highly structured RNA of the 3’ untranslated region (UTR). Although XRN1 digestion of a 3’-terminal 800-nt RNA could stall at a position to generate the sfRNA in vitro, we found that knocking out XRN1 had no effect on the accumulation of sfRNA in Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) infected cells. Mutagenesis studies revealed that the stemloop II (SLII) at the 3’ UTR is required for the accumulation of sfRNA. According to the results of an in vitro RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) assay, the (-)10431-10566 RNA fragment, containing the putative promoter on the antigenome for the sfRNA transcription, binds to RdRp protein and exhibits a strong promoter activity. Taken together, our results indicate that the JEV sfRNA could be transcribed initially and then be trimmed by XRN1 or other unidentified exoribonucleases."
https://openalex.org/W2884973774,"Equol is one of the most active soy isoflavones. When the association between soy food intake in daily life and health outcomes is examined in epidemiological studies, it is important to define the equol-producing status of each individual. However, few studies have assessed equol-producing status without a soy challenge test. To determine a robust cutoff criterion for equol producer classification in observational studies, we conducted a urinary isoflavone concentration survey in daily life among women. Furthermore, we examined the association between eating habits regarding soy foods and equol-producing status. A total of 4,412 participants were included in the analyses. Urinary isoflavones were analyzed using a high-performance liquid chromatography method. We examined the distribution of the log10 equol/daidzein ratios, finding a mixture of two normal distributions, corresponding to equol producer and non-producer subpopulations. Applying a finite mixture model, we estimated the means, standard deviations, and mixing proportions of these two distributions. The estimation was carried out using the SAS NLIN procedure. The optimal cutoff point for the log10 equol/daidzein ratio in the study population was determined to be −1.42, according to the estimated parameters of the mixture distribution. Based on this criterion, 1,830 (41.5%) of the participants were identified as equol producers. Compared with non-consumers of soy foods, consumers of soy foods had significantly higher odds of being equol producers. Using log10-transformed equol/daidzein ratios ≥ −1.42 to define equol producers among Japanese women is reasonable and suitable for determining equol-producing status in epidemiological studies. We found that soy food eating habits were associated with equol-producing status. Further investigation is required to evaluate associations between equol-producing status in daily life and health outcomes. The results of this study suggest the best cutoff point to use in the definition of equol-producing status in daily life."
https://openalex.org/W2884978707,"Objective To provide a neurophysiological tool for assessing sensorimotor pathways, which may differ for those involving distal muscles in simple tasks from those involving distal muscles in a kinetic chain task, or proximal muscles in both. Methods We compared latencies and magnitudes of motor responses in a reaction time paradigm in a proximal (biceps brachii, BB) and a distal (first dorsal interosseous, FDI) muscle following electrical stimuli used as imperative signal (IS) delivered to the index finger. These stimuli were applied during different motor tasks: simple tasks involving either one muscle, e.g. flexing the elbow for BB (FLEX), or pinching a pen for FDI (PINCH); combined tasks engaging both muscles by pinching and flexing simultaneously (PINCH-FLEX). Stimuli were of varying intensity and occasionally elicited a startle response, and a StartReact effect. Results In BB, response latencies decreased gradually and response amplitudes increased progressively with increasing IS intensities for non-startling trials, while for trials containing startle responses, latencies were uniformly shortened and response amplitudes similarly augmented across all IS intensities in both FLEX and PINCH-FLEX. In FDI, response latencies decreased gradually and response amplitudes increased progressively with increasing IS intensities in both PINCH and PINCH-FLEX for non-startling trials, but, unlike in BB for the simple task, in PINCH for trials containing startle responses as well. In PINCH-FLEX, FDI latencies were uniformly shortened and amplitudes similarly increased across all stimulus intensities whenever startle signs were present. Conclusions Our results suggest the presence of different sensorimotor pathways supporting a dissociation between simple tasks that involve distal upper limb muscles (FDI in PINCH) from simple tasks involving proximal muscles (BB in FLEX), and combined tasks that engage both muscles (FDI and BB in PINCH-FLEX), all in accordance with differential importance in the control of movements by cortical and subcortical structures. Significance Simple assessment tools may provide useful information regarding the differential involvement of sensorimotor pathways in the control of both simple and combined tasks that engage proximal and distal muscles."
https://openalex.org/W2884825761,"Much research has considered the relationship between neighbourhood crime and physical activity, but few studies have assessed clinical outcomes consequent to behaviour, such as cardiometabolic risk. Fewer still have simultaneously assessed perceived and objective measures of crime. Perceptions of crime and actual victimisation vary according to gender; thus, this study sought to assess: 1) correspondence between perceived and objective neighbourhood crime; and 2) gender-specific associations between perceived and reported crime and metabolic syndrome, representing cardiometabolic risk. The indirect effect of neighbourhood crime on metabolic syndrome via walking was additionally evaluated. An Australian population-based biomedical cohort study (2004-2007) collected biomedical, socio-demographic, and neighbourhood perceptions data from n = 1,172 urban-dwelling, adults. Area-level reported crime rates were standardised and linked to individual data based on participants' residential location. Correspondence between actual and perceived crime measures was assessed using Pearson correlation coefficients. Cross-sectional associations between crime and metabolic syndrome were analysed using generalised estimating equations regression models accounting for socio-demographic factors and area-level income. Correspondence between perceived and objective crime was small to medium among men and women (r = 0.17 to 0.33). Among men, metabolic syndrome was related to rates of violent (OR = 1.21, 95% CI 1.08-1.35) and total crime (OR = 1.17, 95% CI 1.04-1.32), after accounting for perceived crime. Among women, metabolic syndrome was related to perceived crime (OR = 1.35, 95% CI 1.14-1.60) after accounting for total reported crime. Among women, there were indirect effects of perceived crime and property crime on metabolic syndrome through walking. Results indicate that crime, an adverse social exposure, is linked to clinical health status. Crime rates, and perceptions of crime and safety, differentially impact upon cardiometabolic health according to gender. Social policy and public health strategies targeting crime reduction, as well as strategies to increase perceptions of safety, have potential to contribute to improved cardiometabolic outcomes."

This study investigated some of predictive and prognostic factors for AHB progression to ALF. Methods A retrospective analysis was used to assess the clinical and laboratory features of 293 patients diagnosed with AHB; the patients were divided into the following two groups: ALF (n = 13) and non-ALF (n = 280). Results In total,13 of the 293 (4.43%) patients developed ALF (10 recovered、3 died). The variables of age, anti-HBc IgM titers≥10 S/CO, HBeAg negativity, and total bilirubin (TB) at admission were significantly higher in ALF patients than in non-ALF patients. Compared to non-ALF patients, ALF patients had significantly lower values for prothrombin time activity (PTA), serum albumin, and HBV DNA. At discharge, ALF patients had lower TB normalization rates and much faster clearance of HBsAg, HBeAg and HBVDNA than non-ALF patients. In multivariate analysis, TB≥5×upper limit of normal (ULN) and HBeAg negative status were independent predictors for ALF development at admission, with 84.6% sensitivity, 85.7% specificity, a likelihood ratio of 5.91 and an area under the receiver operating characteristics curve (AUROC) of 0.850.Those who died had lower levels of peak PTA (<20%) and higher levels of peak hepatic encephalopathy (HE) grade (III-IV) than those who recovered. Conclusions Of the patients with ALF, 23.1% died. TB≥5×ULN and HBeAg negative status were the most effective and practicable factors distinguishing ALF from AHB at admission before the onset of encephalopathy. Peak PTA<20% and/or HE grade III-IV were independent predictors of a high probability of death or a need for transplantation."

One of the major causes of morbidity is infection with Methicillin Resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), which has been reported to survive on surfaces for several months. Bactericidal activity of copper-TiO2 thin films, which release copper ions and are deposited on glass surfaces and heated to high temperatures, is well known even when illuminated with very weak UVA light of about 10 μW/cm2. Lately, there is an increased intrerest for one-dimensional TiO2 nanomaterials, due to their unique properties, low cost, and high thermal and photochemical stability. Here we show that copper doped TiO2 nanotubes produce about five times more ·OH radicals as compared to undoped TiO2 nanotubes and that effective surface disinfection, determined by a modified ISO 22196:2011 test, can be achieved even at low intensity UVA light of 30 μW/cm2. The nanotubes can be deposited on a preformed surface at room temperature, resulting in a stable deposition resistant to multiple washings. Up to 103 microorganisms per cm2 can be inactivated in 24 hours, including resistant strains such as Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and Extended-spectrum beta-lactamase Escherichia coli (E. coli ESBL).

Methods The study utilized 2003–2013 claims data from the Taiwanese National Health Insurance Research Database. We identified 4,421 cases of PR from 2007 to 2012 and randomly chose 44,210 non-PR individuals who matched (1:10) for age, sex and the year of index date without prior history of RA, SLE, SSc, SS, DM, or PM. After adjusting for age, sex, and the Charlson comorbidity index, we calculated the hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) using the Cox proportional hazard model to quantify the risk of RA, SLE, SS, DM and PM in PR patients compared with that in matched non-PR individuals. Results Among the 4,421 patients with PR, 569 (12.87%) developed RA, 269 (6.08%) developed SS, 113 (2.56%) developed SLE, 5 (0.11%) developed SSc, 8 (0.18%) developed PM, and 1 (0.02%) developed DM. After adjusting for potential confounders, the patients with PR had an increased risk of RA (HR, 118.76; 95% CI, 89.81–157.04), SS (HR, 59.57; 95% CI, 43.87–80.88), SLE (HR, 51.56; 95% CI, 32.96–80.66) PM (HR, 57.38; 95% CI, 6.90–476.83), and SSc (HR, 13.42; 95% CI, 3.79–47.55) but not of DM (HR, 3.44; 95% CI, 0.34–34.59).

https://openalex.org/W2884990061,"Background Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) caused by ribotype 002 strain is associated with poor outcomes in Chinese patients. Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) is an effective but costly treatment for CDI. We aimed to examine potential cost-effectiveness of ribotype-guided FMT in Chinese patients with severe CDI. Methods A decision-analytic model was designed to simulate outcomes of ribotype 002-guided FMT versus vancomycin treatment in Chinese patients with severe CDI in the hospital setting. Outcome measures included mortality rate; direct medical cost; and quality-adjusted life year (QALY) loss for CDI. Sensitivity analysis was performed to examine robustness of base-case results. Results Comparing to vancomycin treatment, ribotype-guided FMT group reduced mortality (11.6% versus 17.1%), cost (USD8,807 versus USD9,790), and saved 0.472 QALYs in base-case analysis. One-way sensitivity analysis found the ribotype-guided FMT group to remain cost-effective when patient acceptance rate of FMT was >0.6% and ribotype 002 prevalence was >0.07%. In probabilistic sensitivity analysis, ribotype-guided FMT gained higher QALYs at 100% of simulations with mean QALY gain of 0.405 QALYs (95%CI: 0.400–0.410; p<0.001). The ribotype-guided group was less costly in 97.9% of time, and mean cost-saving was USA679 (95%CI: 670–688; p<0.001). Conclusions In the present model, ribotype-guided FMT appears to be a potential option to save QALYs and cost when comparing with vancomycin. The cost-effectiveness of ribotype-guided FMT is subject to the patient acceptance to FMT and prevalence of ribotype 002."
https://openalex.org/W2884465244,"Reproductive monitoring for captive breeding in giant pandas is based on behavioural observation and non-invasive hormone analysis. In urine, interpretation of results requires normalisation due to an animal’s changing hydration. Correction of urinary concentrations based on creatinine is the gold standard. In this study, a largely unexplored, easy-to-perform normalisation technique, based on urinary specific gravity (USpG), was examined and compared to creatinine. To this extent, six cycles from two female pandas (SB741(1) and SB569(5)) were monitored through urine analysis for oestrogen, progesterone, ceruloplasmin and 13,14-dihydro-15-keto-PGF2a (PGFM). The Pearson’s correlation between creatinine and USpG was high (r = 0.805–0.894; p < 0.01), indicative for a similar performance of both normalisation methods. However, generally lower values were observed during pro-oestrus and primary (progesterone) rise. This could be associated with huge shifts in appetite, monitored by faecal output (kg) with an averaged > 50% decrease during oestrus and >50% increase during primary progesterone rise. In parallel, respectively highest and lowest creatinine and USpG levels, were measured, with creatinine obviously more affected as a result of linkage with muscle tissue metabolism affected by reproductive hormones. As a consequence, metabolite levels were significantly different between both corrected datasets with significantly higher oestrogen peak levels during oestrus ranging from 2.13–86.93 and 31.61–306.45 ng/mL (USpG correction) versus 2.33–31.20 and 36.36–249.05 ng/mL Cr (creatinine correction) for SB569 and SB741 respectively, and significant lower progesterone levels during primary progesterone rise ranging from 0.35–3.21 and 0.85–6.80 ng/mL (USpG correction) versus 0.52–10.31 and 2.10–272.74 ng/mL Cr (creatinine correction) for SB569 and SB741 respectively. Consequently, USpG correction rendered unbiased profiles, less subject to variation and metabolic artefacts and therefore allowed a more straightforward identification of peak oestrogen and onset of secondary progesterone rise, being potentially advantageous for future studies unravelling key giant panda reproductive events, including (delayed) implantation. The alternative application of USpG as a normalisation factor was further supported by its easy application and environmental and technical robustness."

BMN 111, a C-type natriuretic peptide analog, inhibits FGFR signaling at the level of the RAF1 kinase through natriuretic peptide receptor 2 (NPR2) and has been shown to lengthen the long bones and improve skull morphology in the Fgfr3Y367C/+ thanatophoric dysplasia mouse model. Here we report the effects of BMN 111 in treating craniosynostosis and aberrant skull morphology in the Fgfr2cC342Y/+ Crouzon syndrome mouse model. We first demonstrated that NPR2 is expressed in the murine coronal suture and spheno-occipital synchondrosis in the newborn period. We then gave Fgfr2cC342Y/+ and Fgfr2c+/+ (WT) mice once-daily injections of either vehicle or reported therapeutic levels of BMN 111 between post-natal days 3 and 31. Changes in skeletal morphology, including suture patency, skull dimensions, and long bone length, were assessed by micro-computed tomography. Although BMN 111 treatment significantly increased long bone growth in both WT and mutant mice, skull dimensions and suture patency generally were not significantly affected. A small but significant increase in the relative length of the anterior cranial base was observed. Our results indicate that the differential effects of BMN 111 in treating various skeletal dysplasias may depend on the process of bone formation targeted (endochondral or intramembranous), the specific FGFR mutated, and/or the specific signaling pathway changes due to a given mutation."
https://openalex.org/W2884922776,"Due to the high rate of antigenic variation of influenza virus, seasonal characterization of the virus is crucial to assess and monitor the emergence of new pathogenic variants and hence formulate effective control measures. However, no study has yet been conducted in Mozambique to assess genetic, antigenic and antiviral susceptibility profile of influenza virus.A subset of samples (n = 20) from influenza positive children detected in two hospitals in Maputo city during 2015 season as part of the implementation of influenza surveillance system, were selected. The following assays were performed on these samples: antigenic characterization by hemagglutination inhibition assay, genetic characterization by Sanger sequencing of hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) and susceptibility to oseltamivir and zanamivir (NA inhibitors) by enzymatic assay.The A(H1N1)pdm09 subtype viruses remained closely related antigenically and genetically to the 2016 vaccine virus A/California/7/2009 and other widely distributed viruses belonging to genetic group 6B. The majority of influenza A(H3N2) viruses studied were antigenically similar to the 2016-2017 vaccine virus, A/Hong Kong/4801/2014, and their HA and NA gene sequences fell into genetic subclade 3C.2a being closely related to viruses circulating in southern Africa. The influenza B viruses were antigenically similar to the 2016 season vaccine virus and HA sequences of all three fell into the B/Yamagata-lineage, clade 3, but contained NA genes of the B/Victoria-lineage. All tested viruses were sensitive to oseltamivir and zanamivir.Overall, all Mozambican influenza A and B viruses were most closely related to Southern African viruses and all were sensitive to oseltamivir and zanamivir. These findings suggest the existence of an ecological niche of influenza viruses within the region and hence highlighting the need for joint epidemiologic and virologic surveillance to monitor the evolution of influenza viruses."
https://openalex.org/W2883658686,"Chemogenomic approaches involving highly annotated compound sets and cell based high throughput screening are emerging as a means to identify novel drug targets. We have previously screened a collection of highly characterized kinase inhibitors (Khan et al., Journal of General Virology, 2016) to identify compounds that increase or decrease expression of a human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) protein in infected cells. To identify potential novel anti-HCMV drug targets we used a machine learning approach to relate our phenotypic data from the aforementioned screen to kinase inhibition profiling of compounds used in this screen. Several of the potential targets had no previously reported role in HCMV replication. We focused on one potential anti-HCMV target, MAPK4K, and identified lead compounds inhibiting MAP4K4 that have anti-HCMV activity with little cellular cytotoxicity. We found that treatment of HCMV infected cells with inhibitors of MAP4K4, or an siRNA that inhibited MAP4K4 production, reduced HCMV replication and impaired detection of IE2-60, a viral protein necessary for efficient HCMV replication. Our findings demonstrate the potential of this machine learning approach to identify novel anti-viral drug targets, which can inform the discovery of novel anti-viral lead compounds."
https://openalex.org/W2884925087,"The effects of prolonged sound stimuli (tone pip trains) on evoked potentials (the rate following response, RFR) were investigated in a beluga whale. The stimuli (rhythmic tone pips) were of 64 kHz frequency at levels from 80 to 140 dB re 1 μPa. During stimulation, every 1000 ms stimulus level either was kept constant (the steady-state stimulation) or changed up/down by 20 or 40 dB. With such stimulus presentation manner, RFR amplitude varied as follows. (i) After a stimulus level increase, the response amplitude increased quickly and then decayed slowly. The more the level increased, the higher the response amplitude increased. (ii) After a stimulus level decrease, the response amplitude was suppressed and then recovered slowly. The more the level decreased, the stronger was the response suppression. (iii) At the end of the 1000 ms window, the response amplitude approached, but did not reach, the amplitude characteristic of the steady-state stimulation. As a result, both after a sound level increase and decrease, the responses were almost stabilized during an analysis time as short as 1 s. This stabilization is attributed to an adaptation process. RFR decay after initial increase could be approximated by an exponent with a time constant of 59.4 ±1.8 (standard error) ms; RFR recovery after initial decrease could be approximated by an exponent with a time constant of 139.2 ±9.9 ms."
https://openalex.org/W2884965416,"Reading serves many ends. Some readers report that works of fiction provide an imaginative escape from the rigors of life, others report reading in order to be intellectually challenged. While various characterizations of readers' engagement with prose fiction have been proposed, few have been checked using representative samples of readers. Our research reports on reader self-descriptions observed in a representative sample of 501 adults in the Netherlands. Reader self-descriptions exhibit regularities, with certain self-descriptions predicting others. Contrary to existing theories which posit two types of readers characterized by non-overlapping concerns (identifying readers and distanced readers), we find that while some readers attend to plot structure or read in order to be intellectually challenged, reader self-descriptions overlap more than received theories predict. We hypothesize that some readers have cultivated more reading techniques than others, with educated or experienced readers tending to report deriving additional experiences from reading."
https://openalex.org/W2949702871,"Recently, joint analysis of multiple traits has become popular because it can increase statistical power to identify genetic variants associated with complex diseases. In addition, there is increasing evidence indicating that pleiotropy is a widespread phenomenon in complex diseases. Currently, most of existing methods test the association between multiple traits and a single genetic variant. However, these methods by analyzing one variant at a time may not be ideal for rare variant association studies because of the allelic heterogeneity as well as the extreme rarity of rare variants. In this article, we developed a statistical method by testing an optimally weighted combination of variants with multiple traits (TOWmuT) to test the association between multiple traits and a weighted combination of variants (rare and/or common) in a genomic region. TOWmuT is robust to the directions of effects of causal variants and is applicable to different types of traits. Using extensive simulation studies, we compared the performance of TOWmuT with the following five existing methods: gene association with multiple traits (GAMuT), multiple sequence kernel association test (MSKAT), adaptive weighting reverse regression (AWRR), single-TOW, and MANOVA. Our results showed that, in all of the simulation scenarios, TOWmuT has correct type I error rates and is consistently more powerful than the other five tests. We also illustrated the usefulness of TOWmuT by analyzing a whole-genome genotyping data from a lung function study."
https://openalex.org/W2884732647,"The crosstalk between cells is important for differentiation of cells. Murine-derived feeder cells, SNL76/7 feeder cells (SNLs) or mouse primary embryonic fibroblast feeder cells (MEFs) are widely used for culturing undifferentiated human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs). It is still unclear whether different culture conditions affect the induction efficiency of definitive endoderm (DE) differentiation from hiPSCs. Here we show that the efficiency of DE differentiation from hiPSCs cultured on MEFs was higher than that of hiPSCs cultured on SNLs. The qPCR, immunofluorescent and flow cytometry analyses revealed that the expression levels of mRNA and/or proteins of the DE marker genes, SOX17, FOXA2 and CXCR4, in DE cells differentiated from hiPSCs cultured on MEFs were significantly higher than those cultured on SNLs. Comprehensive RNA sequencing and molecular network analyses showed the alteration of the gene expression and the signal transduction of hiPSCs cultured on SNLs and MEFs. Interestingly, the expression of non-coding hXIST exon 4 was up-regulated in hiPSCs cultured on MEFs, in comparison to that in hiPSCs cultured on SNLs. By qPCR analysis, the mRNA expression of undifferentiated stem cell markers KLF4, KLF5, OCT3/4, SOX2, NANOG, UTF1, and GRB7 were lower, while that of hXIST exon 4, LEFTY1, and LEFTY2 was higher in hiPSCs cultured on MEFs than in those cultured on SNLs. Taken together, our finding indicated that differences in murine-feeder cells used for maintenance of the undifferentiated state alter the expression of pluripotency-related genes in hiPSCs by the signaling pathways and affect DE differentiation from hiPSCs, suggesting that the feeder cells can potentiate hiPSCs for DE differentiation."
https://openalex.org/W2884159674,"Deficiency in subunits of the conserved oligomeric Golgi (COG) complex results in pleiotropic defects in glycosylation and causes congenital disorders in humans. Insight regarding the functional consequences of this defective glycosylation and the identity of specific glycoproteins affected is lacking. A chemical glycobiology strategy was adopted to identify the surface glycoproteins most sensitive to altered glycosylation in COG-deficient Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells. Following metabolic labeling, an unexpected increase in GalNAz incorporation into several glycoproteins, including α-dystroglycan (α-DG), was noted in cog1-deficient ldlB cells. Western blotting analysis showed a significantly lower molecular weight for α-DG in ldlB cells compared with WT CHO cells. The underglycosylated α-DG molecules on ldlB cells are highly vulnerable to bacterial proteases that co-purify with V. cholerae neuraminidase, leading to rapid removal of the protein from the cell surface. The purified bacterial mucinase StcE can cleave both WT and ldlB α-DG but did not cause rapid degradation of the fragments, implicating other V. cholerae proteases in the final proteolysis of the fragments. Extending terminal glycosylation on the existing mucin-type glycans of ldlB α-DG stabilized the resulting fragments, indicating that fragment stability, but not the initial fragmentation of the protein, is influenced by the glycosylation status of the cell. This discovery highlights a functional importance for mucin-type O-glycans found on α-DG and reinforces a growing role for these glycans as regulators of extracellular proteolysis and protein stability.

https://openalex.org/W2883062627,"Ticagrelor, a P2Y12 antagonist, is approved for prevention of thromboembolic events. MEDI2452 is a potential reversal agent for ticagrelor and ticagrelor active metabolite (TAM). The total plasma exposure of ticagrelor and TAM in patients are roughly 0.5–1 and 0.2–0.5 μmol/L, respectively. Both have similar high potency vs. P2Y12 (Ki 2 nmol/L) but are plasma protein-bound to 99.8% and only the 0.2% free fraction is able to inhibit the P2Y12 receptor. Thus, for unbound concentration measurements to be a proof of mechanism biomarker for MEDI2452 a very high sensitivity is required. Using established techniques as equilibrium dialysis and LC-MS/MS, made it possible to evaluate the efficacy of the reversal agent by measuring reduction of unbound concentration of ticagrelor in the presence of MEDI2452. With challenges such as ultra-low concentrations, small sample volumes, recovery issues and adsorption to plastic we managed to develop a highly sensitive assay for determining unbound concentration levels of ticagrelor and TAM in plasma with a quantification limit of 30 pmol/L and 45 pmol/L, respectively. With this method we were able to detect close to a 100-fold MEDI2452 mediated reduction in the unbound concentration of both ticagrelor and TAM. The assay provided proof of mechanism as MEDI2452 concentration- and dose-dependently eliminated unbound concentration of ticagrelor and reversed its antiplatelet activity in preclinical models and will support future development of MEDI2452."
