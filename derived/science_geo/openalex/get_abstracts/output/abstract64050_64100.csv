https://openalex.org/W2077153229,"Triton-extracted models of Paramecium were reactivated to swim in solutions of adenosine triphosphate and magnesium ions. The cilia beat in the normal direction (toward the rear) when the calcium ion concentration was less than 10-(6)M, and they beat in the ""reversed"" direction (toward the front) when calcium ion concentration was raised above 10-(6)M. These results support the proposal that ciliary reversal, hence backward swimming, of live paramecia is mediated by an increased cytoplasmic calcium concentration around the ciliary system by calcium-dependent membrane responses to external stimuli."

Left-handed people differ in all these respects. The results suggest that the direction in which people look while thinking reflects the lateralization of the underlying cerebral activity."
https://openalex.org/W1506549174,"Abstract Insulin interactions with purified plasma membranes of rat liver were studied with respect to insulin degradation and specific binding to receptors. 125I-insulin was rapidly degraded upon exposure to liver membranes. After only 5 min of incubation at 30° of 125I-insulin (0.3 nm) and liver membranes (1 to 2 mg of protein per ml), 40 to 60% of the labeled hormone was degraded as measured by its ability to specifically bind to a second aliquot of membranes. After 90 min of exposure, less than 10% of the 125I-insulin was intact when measured by its ability to bind specifically to membranes. Binding by anti-insulin antibody, precipitation by trichloroacetic acid, and adsorption by talc were less sensitive methods of measuring degradation. Degradation of 125I-insulin was dramatically reduced at 1°. No significant deiodination was associated with the degradation process. Gel filtration patterns suggested that 125Iinsulin degradation products are composed mainly of small peptide fragments that loosely adsorb to the gel and are eluted after the salt peak. The independence of binding to receptors and degradation is strongly suggested by the following findings. (a) 125I-desalanine-desaparagine insulin, which has an affinity for receptors that is only 2% that of insulin, is degraded to the same extent as 125I-insulin. (b) There is no relationship between the bioactivity of an insulin analogue and its ability to prevent the degradation of 125I-insulin. (c) The apparent Km for insulin degradation is 1.7 x 10-7 m, which is 40-fold more than that concentration of insulin that produces half-maximal inhibition of specific binding of 125I-insulin to receptors in the liver membrane. (d) Insulin that is recovered from membranes upon dissociation of the hormone-receptor complex is undergraded. Proinsulin is very slowly degraded by the liver membranes, but may act as a competitive inhibitor of insulin degradation. This is similar to the findings by others of the insulin-specific protease of muscle and liver. These studies provide evidence that interaction of insulin with liver plasma membranes is a complex phenomenon that involves at least two processes, degradation and binding to receptors. These two processes are largely independent and unrelated under a variety of conditions. Degradation of insulin must be accounted for in making precise quantitative measurements of the interaction of insulin with its receptors in the plasma membrane."

https://openalex.org/W1491006151,"Abstract The incorporation of l-[14C]leucine was measured during a 16-min time interval in rats under various physiological conditions. Rates of albumin and liver protein formation in control rats 5 to 7 weeks of age were 3.13 and 28.8 mg/100 g of body weight per hour, respectively. The half-time of replacement of liver protein was 18 hours, appreciably faster than half-times obtained from measurements of catabolism of labeled liver protein. When synthesis of protein was inhibited by cycloheximide, loss of albumin from hepatic microsomal particles continued at its previously existing rate until the cells were nearly depleted of albumin. Rates of secretion measured in this manner were 0.34 and 0.74 mg per g of liver per hour in adult rats and young nephrotic rats, respectively; corresponding rates of synthesis determined with [14C]leucine were 0.34 and 0.77 mg per g of liver per hour. The agreement between the results obtained with these independent techniques adds some confidence to the use of the [14C]leucine method. The rate of albumin synthesis was unchanged when measured at 10 p.m. compared to 10 a.m. in rats on a 12-hour light-dark cycle. Fasting for 18 hours caused a 40% reduction. In adult rats the rate of albumin synthesis was 34% and that of liver protein 52% of the rates in control rats. No significant increase in albumin synthesis was detected in the presence of nephrosis caused by puromycin aminonucleoside, even when a supplement of protein plus hydrocortisone was given. The dynamics of the transport of albumin and its release from the cytoplasmic particles were similar in all of the conditions studied. The amount of albumin in hepatic microsomes, however, varied directly with the rate of albumin production over a 4-fold range. It is suggested that the stimulus for increased secretion is a small increase in the quantity of albumin in the microsomal particles."
https://openalex.org/W2034198402,Dose-response curves for pink somatic mutations in Tradescantia stamen hairs were analyzed after neutron and x-ray irradiation with doses ranging from a fraction of a rad to the region of saturation. The dose-effect relation for neutrons indicates a linear dependence from 0.01 to 8 rads; between 0.25 and 5 rads a linear dependence is indicated for x-rays also. As a consequence the relative biological effectiveness reaches a constant value (about 50) at low doses. The observations are in good agreement with the predictions of the theory of dual radiation action and support its interpretation of the effects of radiation on higher organisms. The doubling dose of x-rays was found to be nearly 1 rad.

The intramolecular hydrogen bonding scheme and the isopropyl group stereochemistry of uncomplexed valinomycin are compatible with interpretations of spectral measurements for the complexed and uncomplexed molecule in solution but are different from any previously proposed structure. The simple conformational change of a hydrogen bond shift, which could be induced by the process of potassium ion complexing, transforms the uncomplexed into the complexed structure."
https://openalex.org/W1540532192,"Abstract The microsomal enzyme system from rat liver which catalyzes the epoxidation of squalene to 2,3-oxidosqualene (squalene epoxidase) has been investigated further with 10,11-dihydrosqualene as the artificial substrate. Liver supernatant contributes two essential components to the epoxidase system, one heat stable and the other heat labile (Yamamoto, S., AND Bloch, K. (1970) J. Biol. Chem. 245, 1670). The requirement for the heat-stable factor can be fully met by phosphatidylserine, phosphatidylglycerol, or phosphatidylinositol and partially by other phospholipids. The heat-labile supernatant component is a protein, molecular weight 44,000, which has been purified 84-fold. Supernatant protein factor fails to bind either squalene, 10,11-Dihydrosqualene, or 2,3-oxidosqualene as judged by chromatography of mixtures on Sephadex. In an epoxidase system reconstituted from washed microsomes, supernatant protein factor, and phosphatidylserine, FAD raises enzyme activity by about 50%."

Injection of even small doses of nonradioactive L-triiodothyronine reduces the pituitary/ plasma ratio of radioactive L-triiodothyronine, an indication of the existence of pituitary binding sites with a limited capacity for L-triiodothyronine. Limited capacity binding sites for L-thyroxine could not be demonstrated."
https://openalex.org/W1577138064,"Abstract The kinetics of the oxidation of p-cresol by Compound II of horseradish peroxidase has been studied by the stopped flow technique at an ionic strength of 0.11 from pH 2 to 11. In acid solution the reaction is kinetically first order in p-cresol, but in the alkaline region a saturation effect attributable to complex formation is observed. At very high pH an additional second order reaction between p-cresol and the complex is detectable. The existence of the complex is confirmed by spectrophotometric determination of its dissociation constant. Since this constant and the over-all second order rate constant do not depend on any common ionizing group in the enzyme, it is argued that the complex is unproductive in nature. Use of the diffusion-controlled limit shows that p-cresol reacts in the unionized form over the experimental pH range, and that electrostatic interactions are therefore not responsible for the degree of complexity of the pH log rate profile."

Response amplitude of individual rods was measured as a function of intensity both before and at various times after exposure to bleaching illumination. The rod sensitivity increased by at least 3 to 4 log units during a period of 15 to 25 minutes following the bleach. During this time rod pigment regeneration was either too small to be measured or was nonexistent in our preparation.

The minimum molecular weight calculated from sodium dodecyl sulfate gel electrophoresis was 34,000 and from amino acid analysis 36,000. It contained 2 half-cystines and 3 histidines per heme. The purified preparation was soluble in water and appeared to be in an octameric form. 2. Photosystem I particles were depleted of cytochromes by treatment with digitonin and differential centrifugation. These particles photooxidized purified reduced cytochrome f, which in the presence of ascorbate was again reduced in the dark. The oxidation was markedly accelerated by addition of plastocyanin at low concentrations (1 to 10 nm) approximating the P700 concentration. The photooxidation was inhibited by salt and unaffected by nonionic detergents. From the stoichiometry and the high rate of photooxidation, it was concluded that cytochrome f, plastocyanin and Photosystem I form a catalytic complex."
https://openalex.org/W1582892947,"Abstract Binding of p-crestol to native horseradish peroxidase was investigated by differential spectrophotometry, and the value 103 Kdiss = 3 m was obtained at neutral and acid pH; binding is not competitive with that of cyanide and hydroxide. The Soret region spectrum of Compound II of the enzyme was measured in the steady state at pH 4.26, 6.89, and 10.95, and the differences were found to be too small to be attributed to the acid dissociations of an iron-bound group. The kinetics of the reactions between Compound II and p-cresol, ferrocyanide, and iodide was investigated in 94% D2O. Almost no solvent isotope effect was found on the ionization of the group of pKa 8.6. The reaction with p-cresol gave kd/kh = 0.45 ± 0.04, which was attributed to a rate-determining proton transfer. In regions of the pH log rate profile having a slope of - 1 ferrocyanide gave kd/kh = 2.6 ± 0.3 at high pH and 2.9 ± 0.6 at low pH, whereas iodide gave kd/kh = 4.0 ± 0.4. The pH rate profiles, isotope effects, and over-all rates of the three reactions were correlated in terms of a mechanism involving intramolecular general acid catalysis. In sufficiently acidic solutions this ultimately gives way to a specific acid-catalyzed mechanism, and the mechanistic changeover occurs at a higher pH the more difficult the over-all reaction."
https://openalex.org/W2078993649,Rats receiving intraperitoneal injections of sodium salicylate (30 to 300 milligrams per kilogram of body weight) showed a decline in rectal temperature of up to 5.5 degrees C when placed in a 5 degrees C environment. High dosages of salicylate lowered the rectal temperatures of rats kept in a 23 degrees C environment. The finding that salicylate can lower nonfebrile body temperature suggests that this class of antipyretic agents does affect normal temperature regulation.

https://openalex.org/W1546502507,"Abstract The ferrous form of sulfmyoglobin was isolated as the first stable product of the reaction of a single mole of inorganic sulfide with 1 mole of the higher oxidation state derivative of myoglobin, Mbiv. Using radioactive sulfide, it was demonstrated that a single g atom of sulfur is incorporated per mole of myoglobin to form sulfmyoglobin. More than 85% of the radioactive sulfur is extracted into 2-butanone at pH 3.2, bound to the prosthetic group of sulfmyoglobin. The optical properties of the prosthetic group, which we call sulfhemin, and of some of its derivatives have been studied. Sulfhemin is unstable in organic solvents in the presence of O2 or peroxides and decomposes to yield protohemin in an autoxidative reaction which follows first order kinetics. Sulfate is the major sulfur compound ultimately produced in the decomposition of sulfhemin. Mercuric ion was also found to cause the decomposition of sulfhemin."

https://openalex.org/W1565834717,"Abstract The patterns of protein synthesis during the in vitro development of the embryonic rat pancreas have been studied. Electrophoresis in discontinuous acidic and basic urea polyacrylamide gels was used to resolve the exocrine pancreatic proteins. This procedure is shown to give specific profiles of the proteins from different tissues, and may thus be of general usefulness. The pancreas-specific proteins were identified on the discontinuous gels by co-migration with the purified proteins, by enzymatic activity, and by reaction with specific antibodies against the rat exocrine proteins. The rates of synthesis of the specific pancreatic proteins were estimated from the incorporation of l-[3H]leucine into these proteins resolved on the discontinuous urea polyacrylamide gels. The specific radioactivity of the cellular leucine pool was calculated indirectly from leucine pool saturation experiments and from the rate of the protein turn-over. The calculated value was verified by several means including the prediction of the accumulation curves for total and specific proteins in embryonic rat pancreases grown in vitro. The results show that while the rate of total protein synthesis during this period only increases 25% on a cell basis, the synthetic rates for amylase and chymotrypsinogen increase at least 100-fold. The increased synthetic rates account for the observed accumulation of the specific proteins during the secondary developmental transition. Thus, the mechanism of pancreatic cytodifferentiation involves the selective regulation of the synthesis of cell-specific proteins."

https://openalex.org/W1562557847,"Abstract The optical spectrum of carboxysulfmyoglobin (sulf-MbCO), which is prepared in 90% purity, has been studied both at 4° and near liquid nitrogen temperature. An assignment of the spectral transitions further supports the conclusion that the prosthetic group of sulfmyoglobin is an iron chlorin. Sulfmyoglobin has been found to exhibit a rectangular hyperbolic CO binding curve with a p½ of 9 to 10 mm Hg at 4° and pH 8. This represents an affinity at least 1500-fold lower than that of myoglobin under the same conditions. The infrared C—O stretching frequency of CO bound to the iron of ferrous sulfmyoglobin has been found to be 1953.5 ± 0.5 cm-1, about 10 cm-1 higher than that of CO bound to myoglobin. A linear relationship has been found which correlates the logarithms of the O2 and CO affinity constants with the carbonyl stretching frequency, which is taken here as a measure of the electron density at the iron. It is suggested that most of the decrease in O2 and CO affinity of sulfmyoglobin, as compared to myoglobin, can be attributed to the lowering of electron-density at the iron of the prosthetic group. Finally, a photochemical method is described for the conversion of carboxysulfmyoglobin back to carboxymyoglobin."

The pI 3.5 and 3.6 species were not obtained in sufficient quantity for characterization. The variants of pI 3.0, 3.2, and 3.4 together constituted about 90% of the α1-acid glycoprotein obtained from pooled serum. Each of these three variants was found as the predominant species in sera of single donors. The physicochemical analyses of the three principal variants showed no significant differences in the s0.5%20,w values (2.93 S), the absorptivities, A1 cm1% at 278 nm (9.3), and the total content of hexose (14%), hexosamine (13%), or total sugar (40 to 41%). However, the sialic acid content decreased from 12.5 ± 0.5% in the most acidic to 11.3 ± 0.5% in the least acidic variant. On the basis of the amino acid analyses, the pI 3.4 species contains less glutamic acid than the other variants. Material focusing at pH 2.0 was found to be an artifact formed during electrofocusing. Equilibrium dialysis at 4° showed that each of the variants studied had one principal binding site for progesterone and that the binding affinities of the species pI 3.0 (k = 10.4 x 105 m-1) and pI 3.2 (k = 9.2 x 105 m-1) were indistinguishable from that established for the pure glycoprotein isolated from a serum pool.

https://openalex.org/W1586199514,"Abstract The de novo biosynthesis of prothrombin by rat liver microsomes has been studied under various conditions of vitamin K nutriture and 4-hydroxycoumarin drug treatment. Incorporation of label from l-[U-14C]leucine into prothrombin as measured by specific antibody and a radioimmunoassay of net prothrombin biosynthesis with 125I-labeled rat prothrombin were both employed. It was found that the rate of prothrombin biosynthesis in vitro correlated well with the plasma prothrombin levels observed in vivo under various conditions. Liver microsomes from vitamin K-deficient rats or warfarin-treated rats showed a negligible prothrombin synthesis when compared with normal control preparations. When deficient or anti-coagulated rats were treated with doses of vitamin K in vivo required to restore circulating prothrombin levels toward normal, a large increase in the incorporation of isotopic amino acid into prothrombin was observed in vitro which paralleled measurements of net synthesis of prothrombin by radioimmunoassay. Under these conditions, total protein synthesis and serum albumin synthesis as measured by specific antibody were unaffected. When vitamin K1 was added in vitro to microsomes from deficient rats, no effect was observed on the negligible prothrombin synthesis. Similarly, when warfarin was added to microsomes from normal rats, no diminution in prothrombin biosynthesis was observed. Since unfortified rat liver microsomes engage only in peptide chain elongation and not initiation, it was concluded from these data that vitamin K and warfarin probably regulate the initiation of prothrombin biosynthesis in rat liver cells."

The purified radioactive prothrombin showed a single peak on acrylamide gel electrophoresis and was quantitatively precipitated with specific antibody. Similar results were obtained by the direct precipitation of newly synthesized prothrombin from aliquots of the reaction medium that had been suitably sonicated, centrifuged, and cleared with indifferent antigen-antibody complex. The degree of labeling of prothrombin under these conditions corresponded to an incorporation of 5 moles of leucine per mole of prothrombin consistent with chain elongation of previously initiated incomplete prothrombin chains."

https://openalex.org/W1545339590,"Abstract In the presence of pipecolate, Pseudomonas putida P2 (ATCC 25571) converts α-amino[6-14C]adipate to radioactive glutamate with a 14C distribution of 11% and 80% in carbons 1 and 5, respectively. This labeling pattern, when considered with previous data, indicates that α-aminoadipate is an obligate intermediate in the metabolism of pipecolate to glutamate. Some of the 14C in carbon 1 results from tricarboxylic acid cycle activity since cells incubated in the presence of malonate form glutamate with only 5.6% 14C in carbon 1. Cells incubated with dl-[2-14C]pipecolate form [1-14C]glutamate, which distinguishes between two possible pathways for pipecolate catabolism. While this data excludes glutarate as an intermediate in the metabolism of pipecolate to glutamate, dl-α-amino[6-14C]adipate forms radioactive glutarate and [1,5-14C]glutarate forms [1,5-14C]glutamate. From these results and earlier studies it is concluded that the major pathway for l-pipecolate catabolism in P. putida P2 is different from that in mammals. A proposed pathway includes enzyme-bound, or derivatives of, glutarate, glutaconate, and α-hydroxyglutarate as intermediates. The pathway for formation of radioactive glutarate from dl-α-amino[6-14C]adipate is unknown but could represent a minor contribution by a second catabolic pathway. Radioactive glutamate formed from [1,5-14C]glutarate containing 14C in carbon 1 is evidence for a glutarate catabolic route different from that inferred for Pseudomonas fluorescens and mammalian tissue."

Recipients of brain extract from these trained donors showed a significant preference for an even larger circle when given a nonreinforced test for several days after the injection of extract. The substrate for relational learning may be biochemically transferred.
https://openalex.org/W1677549745,"Abstract Forty-eight beef brains were dehydrated with acetone, extracted with chloroform-methanol solutions to remove lipid, and digested with Pronase. The glycopeptides were quantitatively recovered after gel filtration on P-4 resin (yield, 98 g with a carbohydrate content of 55%). The glycopeptides were further purified by chromatography on DEAE-cellulose and P-30 resin to give three fractions, obtained in a total yield of 75%, based on the fucose content of the Pronase digest. The three fractions were analyzed for pentoses, hexoses, hexosamines, hexuronic acid, sialic acid, sulfate, phosphorus, nitrogen, fatty acid, and peptide. Two of the fractions, which were free of fatty acid and hexuronic acid, were pooled (total weight, 5.6 g), desialized, and subjected to partial acid hydrolysis (pH 1.1, 100°, 90 min). The partial hydrolysate was fractionated by gel filtration on P-2 resin to give four peaks. Peak 3 was further purified by DEAE-cellulose and charcoal-Celite chromatography, and yielded 26 mg of a substance that was identified as N-acetyllactosamine by its composition, reduction with NaBH4 to give galactose and N-acetylglucosaminitol, complete cleavage with β-galactosidase, optical rotation, resistance to heating under alkaline conditions, and cochromatography with authentic N-acetyllactosamine in two solvent systems and with borate electrophoresis. Its identity was confirmed by mass spectroscopy of the per(trimethylsilyl)ated derivative. Peak 2 of the partial acid hydrolysate was further purified by deionization and preparative paper chromatography (yield, 3 mg). The substance contained 2 moles of galactose and 1 mole of N-acetylglucosamine. Reduction with NaBH4 established that the N-acetylglucosamine occupied the reducing end. Extended hydrolysis with β-galactosidase quantitatively cleaved the trisaccharide to monosaccharides. Partial hydrolysis with β-galactosidase yielded galactose and N-acetyllactosamine. Smith degradation gave erythritol in an 85% yield. These results indicated that the trisaccharide was galactosyl-β-d-(1 → 4)-N-acetyllactosamine."
https://openalex.org/W192169378,"Abstract The kinetic basis for the reduction in the oxygen affinity of hemoglobin due to carbon dioxide at constant pH, is studied by measuring the deoxygenation rates of oxyhemoglobin with dithionite, as well as the rate of binding of carbon monoxide to deoxyhemoglobin. These studies were performed in buffer containing 0.05 m potassium phosphate, as well as various mixtures of potassium chloride and potassium bicarbonate all at a constant pH of 7.5 and 23°. The results indicate that the reduction in the ligand affinity of hemoglobin by carbon dioxide is the result of a reduced rate of ligand binding with no significant change in the rate of release. It is pointed out that this result is in contrast to salts which reduce the ligand affinity of hemoglobin by increasing the rate of ligand dissociation as well as reducing the rate of ligand binding."
