https://openalex.org/W2167549601,"Bombesin-like peptides have been implicated as autocrine growth factors influencing the pathogenesis and progression of some human lung carcinoma cells. To determine the pharmacologic and structural properties of the bombesin receptors expressed in human lung carcinoma cells, cDNA clones encoding a human gastrin-releasing peptide receptor (GRP-R) and a pharmacologically distinct neuromedin-B preferring bombesin-receptor (NMB-R) were isolated from a human small cell lung carcinoma cell line (NCI-H345). After expression in Xenopus oocytes, a GRP-R-specific antagonist was effective in blocking responses elicited from the cloned GRP-R, but not the NMB-R. Both GRP-R and NMB-R mRNA expression was detected at varying levels in a panel of human lung cancer cell lines. These results indicate heterogeneity of bombesin receptor subtypes exists in human lung carcinoma cells and should be considered in the design of bombesin receptor antagonists intended to inhibit tumor cell growth."
https://openalex.org/W1533422392,"Many promoters respond transcriptionally to elevated levels of cAMP through the cAMP-responsive enhancer (CRE). Several proteins have been characterized which bind to the CRE and presumably modulate CRE-dependent transcription. Of these CRE-binding proteins, only CREB has been shown to be activated by cAMP-dependent protein kinase A (PKA), and as such, CREB represents the only basis for our understanding of cAMP-regulated transcriptional activity. In this report, we describe the complete cDNA sequence of another CRE-binding protein, ATF-1. This protein contains a consensus phosphorylation site for PKA and shares extensive homology with CREB in the region surrounding and carboxyl-terminal to the PKA site. ATF-1 does not contain sequences homologous to the glutamine-rich amino-terminal domain found in CREB, however. ATF-1, like CREB, is expressed in a wide variety of cell types, and ATF-1 is capable of dimerizing with CREB. Both ATF-1 homodimers and ATF-1/CREB heterodimers bind to the CRE but not to the related phorbol ester response element. ATF-1 is as active as CREB in its ability to mediate the transcriptional effects of PKA, and, because ATF-1 has a smaller effect on basal expression, it is actually more responsive than CREB to cAMP. These findings indicate that CREB is not unique in its ability to mediate cAMP-dependent transcriptional regulation."
https://openalex.org/W1527396710,"The cis elements involved in the cAMP regulation of transcription of the gene for phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (GTP) (EC 4.1.1.32) (PEPCK) were studied by introducing a series of block mutations (10-15 base pairs of random sequence) into eight of the protein binding domains in a region of the promoter between -490 and +73. Each mutant promoter was ligated to the structural gene for chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) and transfected into HepG2 cells. Transcription of PEPCK-CAT was stimulated 4-fold by the addition of 8-bromo-cAMP (8-Br-cAMP), whereas overexpression of the catalytic subunit of protein kinase A in these cells increased transcription from the PEPCK promoter 30-fold. Several elements within the PEPCK promoter acted synergistically to mediate this effect. These include CRE-1 (-92 to -82) and a complex unit from -220 to -280 composed of multiple binding sites termed P3(I) (-250 to -234), P3(II) (-260 to -250), and P4 (-286 to -270). Mutation of both CRE-1 and P3(I) resulted in the complete elimination of transcriptional induction by either 8-Br-cAMP or the catalytic subunit of protein kinase A. To examine the proteins involved in this response, we replaced CRE-1, which binds both C/EBP and cAMP-responsive element binding protein (CREB), with an optimal C/EBP binding sequence which significantly decreased the binding of CREB, but maintained the affinity for C/EBP. Transcription from this modified promoter was induced by 8-Br-cAMP and the catalytic subunit of protein kinase A (PKA) to a similar extent as noted with the native PEPCK promoter. However, the results of experiments involving cotransfection of PEPCK-CAT with expression vectors for PKA and either C/EBP or CREB suggest that CREB is capable of mediating a greater responsiveness to PKA than C/EBP. Our results indicate that multiple cis elements are involved in the cAMP induction of PEPCK gene transcription and that C/EBP and CREB are potentially involved in this response."
https://openalex.org/W1578939248,"To localize the protease(s) involved in shedding of tumor necrosis factor receptors (TNF-R) from activated neutrophils (PMN) (Porteu, F., and C. Nathan (1990) J. Exp. Med. 172, 599-607), we tested subcellular fractions from PMN for their ability to cause loss of TNF-R from intact cells. Exposure of PMN to sonicated azurophil granules at 37 degrees C resulted in inhibition of 125I-TNF binding; 50% inhibition ensued when PMN were treated for approximately 1 min with azurophil granules equivalent to 2-3 PMN per indicator cell. The TNF-R-degrading activity in azurophil granules were identified as elastase by its sensitivity to diisopropyl fluorophosphate (DFP), alpha 1-antitrypsin and N-methoxysuccinyl-Ala-Ala-Pro-Val chloromethyl ketone (MSAAPV-CK), and by the ability of purified elastase to reproduce the effect of azurophil granules. Elastase preferentially acted on the 75-kDa TNF-R, reducing by 85-96% the binding of 125I-TNF to mononuclear cells expressing predominantly this receptor, while having no effect on endothelial cells expressing almost exclusively the 55-kDa TNF-R. Elastase-treated PMN released a 32-kDa soluble fragment of p75 TNF-R that bound TNF and reacted with anti-TNF-R monoclonal antibodies. In contrast, fMet-Leu-Phe-activated PMN shed a 42-kDa fragment from p75 TNF-R, along with similar amounts of a 28-kDa fragment from p55 TNF-R. Shedding of both TNF-Rs by intact activated PMN was more extensive than shedding caused by elastase and was completely resistant to DFP and MSAAPV-CK. Thus, the TNF-R-releasing activity of azurophil granules is distinct from that operative in intact stimulated PMN and could provide an additional mechanism for the control of cellular responses to TNF at sites of inflammation."
https://openalex.org/W1585071559,"Plasma membranes from bovine liver contain a phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate-specific phospholipase C (PLC) activity that is activated by guanine nucleotides. The G-proteins involved retained their ability to activate bovine brain PLC-beta 1 in a guanosine 5‘-O-(3-thiotriphosphate) (GTP gamma S)-dependent manner following extraction from the membranes with cholate and reconstitution with phospholipids. This reconstitution assay was used to purify the G-proteins by chromatography on heparin-Sepharose, DEAE-Sephacel, octyl-Sepharose, hydroxylapatite, Mono Q, and Sephacryl S-300 gel filtration. Gel electrophoresis showed that two alpha-subunits with molecular mass of 42 and 43 kDa were isolated to a high degree of purity, together with a beta-subunit. Neither alpha-subunit was a substrate for pertussis toxin-catalyzed ADP-ribosylation. Gel filtration of the final activity indicated an apparent molecular mass of 95 kDa, suggesting the presence of an alpha beta gamma heterotrimer. Immunological data revealed that the 42- and 43-kDa proteins were related to alpha-subunits of the Gq class recently purified from brain (Pang, I.-H., and Sternweis, P. C. (1990) J. Biol. Chem. 265, 18707-18712) and identified by molecular cloning (Strathmann, M., and Simon, M. I. (1990) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 87, 9113-9117). The activation of PLC-beta 1 by the purified G-protein preparation was specific for nonhydrolyzable guanine nucleotides, the efficacy decreasing in order GTP gamma S greater than guanylimidodiphosphate greater than guanylyl(beta,gamma-methylene)-diphosphonate. Half-maximal activation required 4 microM GTP gamma S suggesting that the affinity of the G-proteins for GTP analogues is low. The GTP gamma S-dependent activation of PLC-beta 1 required millimolar Mg2+ and was inhibited by guanosine 5‘-O-(2-thiodiphosphate) and by excess beta gamma-subunits. Aluminum fluoride also activated PLC-beta 1 in the presence of the G-proteins. The G-proteins were inactive toward PLC-gamma 1 or PLC-delta 1. In summary, these findings identify two G-protein activators of PLC-beta 1 that have the properties of heterotrimeric G-proteins and are members of the Gq class."
https://openalex.org/W1588224758,"The extracellular domain of the 55-kDa TNF receptor (rsTNFR beta) has been expressed as a secreted protein in baculovirus-infected insect cells and Chinese hamster ovary (CHO)/dhfr- cells. A chimeric fusion protein (rsTNFR beta-h gamma 3) constructed by inserting the extracellular part of the receptor in front of the hinge region of the human IgG C gamma 3 chain has been expressed in mouse myeloma cells. The recombinant receptor proteins were purified from transfected cell culture supernatants by TNF alpha- or protein G affinity chromatography and gel filtration. In a solid phase binding assay rsTNFR beta was found to bind TNF alpha with high affinity comparable with the membrane-bound full-length receptor. The affinity for TNF beta was slightly impaired. However, the bivalent rsTNFR beta-h gamma 3 fusion protein bound both ligands with a significantly higher affinity than monovalent rsTNFR beta reflecting most likely an increased avidity of the bivalent construct. A molecular mass of about 140 kDa for both rsTNFR beta.TNF alpha and rsTNFR beta.TNF beta complexes was determined in analytical ultracentrifugation studies strongly suggesting a stoichiometry of three rsTNFR beta molecules bound to one TNF alpha or TNF beta trimer. Sedimentation velocity and quasielastic light scattering measurements indicated an extended structure for rsTNFR beta and its TNF alpha and TNF beta complexes. Multiple receptor binding sites on TNF alpha trimers could also be demonstrated by a TNF alpha-induced agglutination of Latex beads coated with the rsTNFR beta-h gamma 3 fusion protein. Both rsTNFR beta and rsTNFR beta-h gamma 3 were found to inhibit binding of TNF alpha and TNF beta to native 55- and 75-kDa TNF receptors and to prevent TNF alpha and TNF beta bioactivity in a cellular cytotoxicity assay. Concentrations of rsTNFR beta-h gamma 3 equimolar to TNF alpha were sufficient to neutralize TNF activity almost completely, whereas a 10-100-fold excess of rsTNFR beta was needed for similar inhibitory effects. In view of their potent TNF antagonizing activity, recombinant soluble TNF receptor fragments might be useful as therapeutic agents in TNF-mediated disorders."
https://openalex.org/W1538427184,"Somatostatin (SRIF) induces its biological effects by interacting with membrane-bound receptors that are linked to cellular effector systems via G proteins. We have studied SRIF receptor-G protein associations by solubilizing the SRIF receptor from rat brain and AtT-20 cells and immunoprecipitating the receptor-G protein complex with peptide-directed antisera against the different subunits of the G protein heterotrimer. Antiserum 8730, which selectively interacts with all Gi alpha subtypes, maximally and specifically immunoprecipitated SRIF receptor-Gi alpha complexes. To identify the subtypes of Gi alpha that are coupled to SRIF receptors, the subtype-selective antisera 3646, 1521, and 1518, which specifically interact with Gi alpha 1, Gi alpha 2, and Gi alpha 3, respectively, were used to immunoprecipitate SRIF receptor-Gi alpha complexes. Antiserum 3646 immunoprecipitated SRIF receptor-Gi alpha 1 complexes from both brain and AtT-20 cells. Antiserum 1521 immunoprecipitated Gi alpha 2 from both brain and AtT-20 cells but did not immunoprecipitate SRIF receptors from these tissues. Antiserum 1518 immunoprecipitated AtT-20 cell SRIF receptors but uncoupled brain SRIF receptor-G protein complexes. This result was confirmed with another peptide-selective antiserum, SQ, directed against Gi alpha 3. The findings from these studies indicate that Gi alpha 1 and Gi alpha 3 are coupled to SRIF receptors, whereas Gi alpha 2 is not. Even though brain and AtT-20 cell SRIF receptors were both coupled to Gi alpha, the receptors from these tissues differed in their coupling to Go alpha. Antiserum 2353, which is directed against Go alpha, immunoprecipitated SRIF receptors from AtT-20 cells, but did not immunoprecipitate or uncouple SRIF receptor-G protein complexes from rat brain. To determine the beta subunits associated with the SRIF receptor, antisera directed against G beta 36 and G beta 35 were used to immunoprecipitate SRIF receptor-G protein complexes from brain. Peptide-directed antiserum against G beta 36 selectively immunoprecipitated solubilized brain SRIF receptors. However, antiserum directed against the G beta 35 subunit did not immunoprecipitate brain SRIF receptors, suggesting that brain SRIF receptors may preferentially associate with G beta 36. In addition to coimmunoprecipitating with Gi alpha and G beta, brain SRIF receptors coimmunoprecipitated the G protein gamma subunits, G gamma 2 and G gamma 3. These results provide the first evidence that SRIF receptors are coupled to different subunits of G proteins and suggest that selectivity exists in the association of different G protein subunits with the SRIF receptor."
https://openalex.org/W1585695184,"We have identified a binding site for tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases 2 (TIMP-2) on human 72-kDa gelatinase that is distinct from the active site. 72-kDa progelatinase is found in a complex with TIMP-2 in the medium of cultured cells and can be activated with organomercurial compounds to yield a gelatinolytic proteinase that remains bound to TIMP-2. Removal of TIMP-2 from 72-kDa progelatinase by reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography, followed by reconstitution of the progelatinase in neutral pH buffer, results in autocatalytic activation. When samples of autoactivated gelatinase were blotted onto nitrocellulose, then probed with 125I-TIMP-2, we found a 29-kDa peptide that was capable of binding TIMP-2. We isolated this fragment and identified it as the region of gelatinase from amino acid 414 to the carboxyl terminus in the primary amino acid sequence of progelatinase. This portion of the molecule does not contain the putative zinc- or gelatin-binding sites and is proteolytically inactive. Incubation of 125I-TIMP-2 with 72-kDa progelatinase-TIMP-2 complexes resulted in a concentration-dependent exchange of labeled TIMP-2 with unlabeled TIMP-2, in both the presence and absence of the metalloproteinase inhibitor 1,10-phenanthroline. Saturation binding kinetics for the active site of 72-kDa gelatinase were measured in pools of the 43-kDa active fragment that results from the autoactivation of 72-kDa progelatinase; this fragment has no carboxyl-terminal TIMP-2 binding capability. Binding of 125I-TIMP-2 to the active site was completely inhibited by 1,10-phenanthroline. Binding kinetics for the putative stabilization site were determined with isolated 72-kDa progelatinase. In the presence of 1,10-phenanthroline, 72-kDa progelatinase bound 125I-TIMP-2 but not 125I-TIMP-1. Scatchard analysis yielded an approximate dissociation constant (Kd) of 0.72 nM for the active site and 0.42 nM for the stabilization site."
https://openalex.org/W1489466981,"Upon exposure to follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), the gonadotropin-responsive Sertoli cell expresses increased rolipram-sensitive cAMP-specific phosphodiesterase (cAMP-PDE) activity. To understand the mechanisms leading to this activation, the cAMP-PDEs present in the Sertoli cell were characterized and their regulation studied. Comparison of the conceptual translates of two groups of PDE cDNA clones isolated from a Sertoli cell cDNA library (ratPDE3 and ratPDE4) showed that the encoded proteins were structurally similar, containing a core region of 455 amino acids with a sequence identity of 87%. The amino and carboxyl termini were divergent. Expression of these cDNAs in Escherichia coli and monkey COS-7 cells demonstrated that the encoded cAMP-PDEs had similar affinities for the cAMP substrate and were equally sensitive to a number of PDE inhibitors (rolipram greater than Ro 20-1724 greater than cilostamide). FSH stimulation of the Sertoli cell produced an increased rate of transcription of the ratPDE3 gene and elevated mRNA levels for ratPDE3 and to a lesser extent of ratPDE4. The increase in mRNA levels was detected after 1 h of stimulation. Forskolin, cholera toxin, and N6, O2'-dibutyryl cAMP produced a similar increase in rate of transcription and elevated mRNA levels, indicating that this activation is mediated by an increase in intracellular cAMP. RatPDE4 mRNA levels were maximal upon exposure to 10 ng of FSH/ml, whereas ratPDE3 mRNA levels could be further elevated, with higher FSH concentrations. The intensity of an immunoreactive band with characteristics identical to a purified cAMP-PDE, correlated with the increased cAMP hydrolytic activity after FSH or dibutyryl cAMP treatment, demonstrating that changes in cAMP-PDE protein levels are involved in this regulation. These data provide evidence that multiple cAMP-PDE forms are expressed in the rat Sertoli cell. Although differences in the pattern of activation of these forms were observed, these data show, that in the rat Sertoli cell, the cAMP-PDE activity is regulated by hormones via a novel mechanism that involves a cAMP-dependent activation of transcription of a PDE gene."
https://openalex.org/W1584519687,"A baculovirus expression vector system (BEVS) was used to overproduce the full-length human vitamin D receptor (hVDR) in Spodoptera frugiperda ovarian cells. hVDR was expressed to a level of 0.5% of the total soluble protein in this system. Western analysis demonstrated that the baculovirus-generated protein had electrophoretic and immunologic properties equivalent to those of hVDR expressed in mammalian cells. The BEVS-derived receptor displayed specificity and high affinity (apparent Kd = 0.7 nM) for the 1,25(OH)2D3 ligand. Recombinant hVDR generated a specific protein-DNA complex with a duplex oligomer containing a vitamin D-responsive element (VDRE) in gel mobility shift assays. The intensity of the VDR.VDRE complex was not affected by 1,25(OH)2D3. However, the complex exhibited increased mobility in the presence of hormone, possibly the result of a 1,25(OH)2D3-dependent conformational change. A nuclear extract obtained from CV-1 cells markedly enhanced the intensity of this VDR.VDRE complex and produced an additional distinct VDR-dependent complex, thus implicating a role for nuclear auxiliary factors in multiple high affinity VDR.VDRE interactions. Finally, methylation interference studies defined the guanine residues contacted when the putative VDR-auxiliary factor complex associates with the rat osteocalcin VDRE; specifically, all of the GC base pairs in the sequence GGGTGAATGAGGACA. Therefore, these results show that the BEV system elicits high level expression of hVDR with critical functional characteristics being preserved."
https://openalex.org/W1600250147,"The final rapid growth phase of the chicken oocyte is characterized by massive uptake of hepatically synthesized yolk precursor proteins from the plasma. The two major yolk-forming components, very low density lipoprotein (VLDL) and vitellogenin (VTG), have been shown to interact with a 95-kDa protein present in detergent extracts of ovarian membranes; this protein is absent in hens of a mutant nonlaying chicken strain (Nimpf, J., Radosavljevic, M., and Schneider, W. J. (1989) J. Biol. Chem. 264, 1393-1398). Here, we have purified the 95-kDa protein by ligand and immunoaffinity chromatography and demonstrated its role in receptor-mediated endocytosis by ultrastructural immunolocalization, structural, and functional studies. The receptor was visualized exclusively in the oocyte proper and was absent from somatic cells, in agreement with the previously reported expression of two different lipoprotein receptors in somatic cells and oocytes, respectively, of laying hens (Hayashi, K., Nimpf, J., and Schneider, W. J. (1989) J. Biol. Chem. 264, 3131-3139). Amino acid sequences of tryptic fragments of the oocyte receptor were obtained, and its kinship to somatic low density lipoprotein receptors was confirmed through the demonstration of sequence conservation in three characteristic domains. In particular, the chicken receptor's internalization sequence, Phe-Asp-Asn-Pro-Val-Tyr, is identical with that in low density lipoprotein receptors from mammals as well as Xenopus laevis. The ligand-binding properties, specificity, and kinetic parameters of the oocyte receptor were characterized in filtration assays employing pure ligands and receptor. In conjunction with ligand-blotting experiments following limited protease digestion of the receptor, the binding assay data suggest that VTG recognizes a substructure of the VLDL-binding site. These studies establish that a cell-specific receptor mediates the endocytosis of VTG and VLDL into growing chicken oocytes and thus possibly plays a key role in control of oocyte growth."
https://openalex.org/W1509335780,"Using three experimental approaches, we have addressed the questions of whether the presence of saturably bound plays a role in potentiating the activation of platelet phospholipase C (PLC) and/or accumulation of the 3-phosphorylated phosphoinositides (3-PPI), i.e. phosphatidylinositol 3,4-bisphosphate and phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate, and whether the generation of tethered ligand (Vu, T-K.H., Hung, D. T., Wheaton, V. I., and Coughlin, S. R. (1991) Cell 64, 1057-1068) by can account fully for thrombin's proteolytic effects in activating platelets, as gauged by the above parameters. We have 1) measured PLC activation or 3-PPI after we have exposed platelets to for various periods and either blocked thrombin's proteolytic activity without interrupting its binding or blocked both binding and proteolytic activity of thrombin; 2) attempted to potentiate 3-PPI accumulation, using combinations of protein kinase C stimulation, Ca2+ elevation, and saturating but proteolytically inactive thrombins; and 3) compared the activation of platelets by with activation by the thrombin receptor-directed peptide, SFLLRNPNDKYEPF (SFLL; a portion of the tethered ligand created by thrombin's proteolytic activity), and examined the effect of on this latter activation. We conclude that the initial and sustained effects of in stimulating PLC and the accumulation of 3-PPI are completely attributable to thrombin's proteolytic activity. Further, thrombin's effects in promoting these responses can be accounted for by the actions of SFLL peptide, and by implication, formation of tethered ligand."
https://openalex.org/W1589816259,"Abstract In rod photoreceptor cells, the light response is triggered by an enzymatic cascade that causes cGMP levels to fall: excited rhodopsin (Rho*)----rod G-protein (transducin, Gt)----cGMP-phosphodiesterase (PDE). This results in the closure of plasma membrane channels that are gated by cGMP. PDE activation by Gt occurs when GDP bound to the alpha-subunit of Gt (Gt alpha) is exchanged with free GTP. The interaction of Gt alpha-GTP with the gamma-subunits of PDE releases their inhibitory action and causes cGMP hydrolysis. Inactivation is thought to be caused by subsequent hydrolysis of Gt alpha-GTP by an intrinsic Gt-GTPase activity. Here we report that there are two portions of Gt in frog rod outer segments (ROS) expressing different rates of GTP hydrolysis: 19.5 +/- 3 mmol of Gt/mol of Rho, equivalent to that amount which participates in PDE activation, hydrolyzing GTP at a rate of approximately 0.6 turnover/s (fast) and the remaining Gt (80.5 +/- 3 mmol/mol Rho) hydrolyzing GTP at a rate of 0.058 +/- 0.009 turnover/s. Fast GTPase activity is abolished in the presence of cGMP. This effect occurs over the physiological range of cGMP concentration changes in ROS, half-saturating at approximately 2 microM and saturating at 5 microM cGMP. cGMP-dependent suppression of GTPase is specific for cGMP; cAMP in millimolar concentration does not affect GTPase, while the poorly hydrolyzable cGMP analogue, 8-bromo-cGMP, mimics the effect. GTPase regulation by cGMP is not affected by Ca2+ over the concentration range 5-500 nM, which spans the physiological changes in cytoplasmic Ca2+ in rod cells. We suggest that the fast cGMP-sensitive GTPase activity is a property of the Gt that activates PDE. In this model, cGMP serves not only as a messenger of excitation but also modulates GTPase activity, thereby mediating negative feedback regulation of the pathway via PDE turnoff: a light-dependent decrease in cGMP accelerates the hydrolysis of GTP bound to Gt, resulting in the rapid inactivation of PDE."
https://openalex.org/W1608544771,"The photoaffinity reagent 8-[(4-azidophenyl)-methoxy]-1-tritiomethyl-2, 3-dimethylimidazo-[1,2-alpha]pyridinium iodide ([3H]mDAZIP) has been synthesized and used to photoinactivate and label purified hog gastric H+,K(+)-ATPase. The specific (K(+)-sensitive) components of both photoinactivation and labeling showed dependences on inhibitor concentration consistent with covalent modification at an extracytoplasmic site of reversible K(+)-competitive binding in the dark. The maximum amount of specific labeling (1.2 nmol/mg) was similar to the number of phosphorylation sites measured (1.0 +/- 0.14 nmol/mg). Specific labeling was distributed 76% on the alpha chain, 18% on the beta chain, and 6% on undefined peptides. Various digestions with trypsin, protease V8, and thermolysin were employed to fragment the labeled enzyme. Gasphase sequencing of the radioactive peptides identified the major site of specific labeling to be within a region where only two stretches of amino acids (Leu105 to Ile126 and Leu139 to Phe155, designated H1 and H2, respectively) are predicted to span the membrane. This in turn suggested that the labeling site was located within or close to the proposed loop between them (Gln127 to Asn138). A computer-driven energy minimization protocol yielded a loop structure to which SCH 28080 (the parent structure of [3H]mDAZIP) could be docked. Conversely, modeling of the corresponding region of Na+,K(+)-ATPase (a homologous enzyme with much lower affinity for SCH 28080) yielded no apparent binding site. Similarities in the inhibition of H+,K(+)-ATPase by SCH 28080 and of Na+,K(+)-ATPase by ouabain lead to the hypothesis that, in each case, inhibitor binding to E2-P is associated with an increase in the hydrophobicity of the environment of the loop between H1 and H2."
https://openalex.org/W1511788007,"The full-length human renal mineralocorticoid receptor (hMR) has been overproduced in Spodoptera frugiperda (Sf9) insect cells using baculovirus-mediated expression. The overproduced hMR binds aldosterone with high affinity (Kd = 1.36 nM) and has high affinity for cortisol, cortexolone, and progesterone. Immunoprecipitation and immunoblot analysis of the recombinant hMR with MR-specific antibodies reveal three major protein bands with molecular masses of 115, 119, and 125 kDa. hMR isoforms show maximal accumulation at 48 h post-infection with the recombinant baculovirus. Maximal aldosterone binding was detected at 24 h rather than at 48 h post-infection, suggesting that the assembly of hMR monomers into the nonactivated steroid-binding receptor complexes and/or their stability deteriorates after 24 h post-infection. It is estimated by specific aldosterone binding that 1.2 x 10(6) hMR molecules are expressed per Sf9 cell (equivalent to 7 pmol/mg of cytosolic protein) at 24 h post-infection. 5-Fold more receptor molecules/cell are expressed but not detected by steroid binding at 48 h post-infection as determined by immunoblot analysis. Using the MR-specific H10E anti-idiotypic monoclonal antibody, immunoprecipitation of cytosol from recombinant baculovirus-infected Sf9 cells pulse-labeled with 32Pi demonstrated for the first time that the recombinant hMR is highly phosphorylated. The hMR is expressed as 9-10 S oligomeric complexes (Stokes radii approximately 67-85 A) that are slightly heavier than the unactivated glucocorticoid receptor and can be converted to smaller 4 S receptor monomers (Stokes radii approximately 25-55 A) by elevated temperature, pH, and ionic strength. Unlike the glucocorticoid receptor, the oligomeric hMR complex can bind DNA-cellulose without prior activation. Finally, indirect immunofluorescence demonstrated that the hMR is expressed primarily as a cytoplasmic protein that can be induced to translocate to the nucleus upon treatment with hormone."
https://openalex.org/W1625442594,"Oncostatin M is a growth regulatory protein secreted by macrophages and activated T lymphocytes. In a hepatoma cell line (HepG2) the polypeptide very potently increased low density lipoprotein (LDL) uptake with an EC50 of 0.1-0.2 nM. The stimulation of LDL uptake was detectable by 2 h, was maximal by 8 h, and remained elevated through 20 h of oncostatin M incubation. In a similar fashion, oncostatin M also increased the number of cell surface LDL receptors by a mechanism that was inhibited by cycloheximide or the protein kinase C inhibitor H-7. Oncostatin M stimulation of LDL uptake and receptor protein occurred regardless of the state of cholesterol-dependent regulation of HepG2 LDL receptor (i.e. cells incubated in medium containing lipoproteins responded to the same extent as did cells incubated in the absence of lipoproteins). No significant effects were observed on sterol synthesis over 8 h or on DNA synthesis over 24 h. Oncostatin M induced rapid alterations in HepG2 phospholipid metabolism. Within 5-15 min there was a 20-50% increase in incorporation of 32P into several classes of phospholipids, including the phosphoinositides. Radiolabeled diacylglycerol levels were elevated 20% by 2 min and nearly 50% by 15 min. In addition, the polypeptide induced rapid increased (within 1 min) in phosphorylation of HepG proteins on tyrosine residues. Stimulation of both phosphotyrosine and LDL receptor up-regulation by oncostatin M was decreased by the tyrosine kinase inhibitor genistein. We propose that oncostatin M up-regulates HepG2 LDL receptor expression by a mechanism that includes stimulation of a tyrosine kinase followed by generation of phospholipid-related second messengers."
https://openalex.org/W1501164720,"The insulin-like growth factor-binding protein IGF-BP1 is a major secretory protein of human endometrial stromal cells decidualized in culture. Anion exchange chromatography and nondenaturing gel electrophoresis showed IGF-BP1 to exist in five electrophoretically and chromatographically distinct isoforms. IGF-BP1 variants migrated as a quintet on nondenaturing polyacrylamide gels and as a single band (28 kDa) on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels. Alkaline phosphatase treatment reduced the IGF-BP1 variants to a single band. Cells incubated with [32P]orthophosphate for 12 h secreted four 32P-labeled IGF-BP1 phosphovariants, and their migration coincided with those bands that were eliminated by alkaline phosphatase treatment. In cells treated with medroxyprogesterone acetate and relaxin, the concentration of phosphorylated IGF-BP1 was increased dramatically as compared with controls. All the phosphovariants were confirmed to be IGF-BP1 by their ability to be supershifted on nondenaturing polyacrylamide gels after binding a monoclonal antibody to IGF-BP1. Thin layer electrophoresis of IGF-BP1 acid hydrolysates showed IGF-BP1 to be phosphorylated exclusively on serine. Non-phosphorylated IGF-BP1 was phosphorylated by the catalytic subunit of the cAMP-dependent protein kinase and casein kinase II in vitro. This suggests that IGF-BP1 may be a substrate of multiple protein kinases in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W1589733225,"A previous study on cleavage of disulfide bonds in endocytosed model compounds had shown that an initial phase of cleavage was totally inhibited by membrane-impermeant sulfhydryl inhibitors and thus was mediated by cell surface sulfhydryls (Feener, E. P., Shen, W.-C., and Ryser, H. J.-P. (1990) J. Biol. Chem. 265, 18780-18785). This paper uses the same inhibitors (5,5‘-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) and p-chloromercuriphenylsulfonic acid) to examine the role of surface sulfhydryls in the cytotoxicity of diphtheria toxin (DT). Since the interchain disulfide of endocytosed DT must be cleaved prior to translocation of chain A from endosomes to cytoplasm, it was postulated that surface sulfhydryls might mediate the cleavage of that disulfide bond as well. Both sulfhydryl blockers did indeed markedly inhibit DT cytotoxicity. This effect was not due to inactivation of unbound DT, inhibition of receptor-mediated endocytosis, or impairment of acidification of endosomes. We conclude that cell surface sulfhydryls susceptible to blockage by 5,5‘-dithiobis(2-nitro-benzoic acid) and p-chloromercuriphenylsulfonic acid are required for the cytotoxicity of DT and, most likely, for the reductive cleavage of DT's interchain disulfides. Ricin cytotoxicity was not decreased; this is consistent with the view that ricin reaches the cytoplasm from a late endocytic structure and with the finding that endocytosed disulfides are also cleaved in a cell fraction containing elements of the Golgi apparatus (Feener, E. P., Shen, W.-C., and Ryser, H. J.-P. (1990) J. Biol. Chem. 265, 18780-18785)."
https://openalex.org/W1542601568,"Engagement of membrane IgM on a number of human and murine B-cell lines induced activation of a Mn(2+)-preferring serine/threonine kinase that phosphorylated microtubule-associated protein-2 (MAP-2) in vitro. B-cell MAP-2 kinase (MAP-2K) activity could be fractionated into two peaks by sequential DEAE and hydrophobic chromatography. Although peak I included two tyrosine phosphoproteins of molecular mass 36 and 38 kDa, peak II showed a single 42-kDa tyrosine phosphoprotein (pp42). Since all kinase activity could be removed from peak II material over an antiphosphotyrosine immune affinity column, it suggests that pp42 is identical with lymphoid MAP-2K. Although peak I activity showed a similarity to peak II with regard to its preference for Mn2+, sensitivity to phosphatase exposure, and resistance to a range of common serine kinase inhibitors, it is not clear whether these activities are related. MAP-2 kinase activity could also be induced by treatment with the phorbol ester, phorbol myristate 13-acetate, suggesting that protein kinase C may also be involved with MAP-2K regulation. Although MAP-2K activity reached a peak response within minutes of receptor ligation, there were differences in the rates of dephosphorylation of pp42 and decline of MAP-2K activity in different B-cell lines. The tyrosine phosphatase inhibitor, vanadate, transformed a rapidly reversible MAP-2K response in BAL 17.2 cells into a sustained state of activation that resembled the kinetics of activation in WEHI-231 cells. The latter finding implies involvement of a tyrosine phosphatase, which opposes the effect of an inducing tyrosine kinase."
https://openalex.org/W1716544235,"To identify the cis-acting elements responsible for cAMP stimulation of human prolactin (hPRL) promoter activity, pituitary GC cells were transfected with 5'-deleted hPRL promoters fused to the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase reporter gene. The proximal regulatory region (coordinates -250 to -42) was sufficient to confer strong cAMP stimulation (+/- 25 fold). Further 5' and 3' deletions performed within this proximal region demonstrated that two types of cis-acting elements are involved in the cAMP regulation: (i) the binding sites of the pituitary-specific factor Pit-1, and (ii) the sequence between coordinates -115 and -85 (named fragment A), which contains a TGACG motif. We show by gel-shift and Southwestern experiments that fragment A binds Pit-1 monomer and also a ubiquitous factor that is neither cAMP-responsive element-binding protein nor activator protein-1. Strong cAMP induction was observed when fragment A was juxtaposed to a Pit-1 binding site. That Pit-1 plays an important role was supported further by the finding that the hPRL proximal region conferred cAMP regulation when linked to the herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase promoter only in pituitary GC cells and not in other heterologous cells, which do not express Pit-1. Furthermore, we observed that concatenated Pit-1 binding sites were able to confer cAMP responsiveness to the thymidine kinase promoter in GC cells."
https://openalex.org/W1554341067,"External ATP induces [3H] dopamine [( 3H]DA) release in rat pheochromocytoma cells (PC-12 cells). The ATP-induced release is a saturable process with half-effective concentration of EC50 = 80 microM. ADP is a poor secretagogue of [3H]DA (one-sixth of ATP) and AMP is devoid of secretory capabilities. Adenosine and the non-hydrolyzable analogues of ATP, AppNHp and AppCp are ineffective as inducers of [3H]DA, release, or as inhibitors of the ATP-induced [3H]DA release. The most potent antagonist of ATP-induced release is Coomassie Blue (IC50 = 25 microM), compared to ADP beta S (IC50 = 500 microM). The overall rank order of potency is ATP greater than ADP much greater than AMP greater than adenosine, which is characteristic of the P2-purinergic receptor. ATP-induced secretion is absolutely Ca2+ dependent, indicating an exocytotic process and is independent of Mg2+ (up to 2 mM) suggesting that the active species is not ATP4-. (a) The ATP-induced 45Ca2+ influx into the cells is in good correlation to ATP induction of release (IC50 = 80 and 90 microM, respectively) and is carried over to ADP which has a diminished ability to induce both release and 45Ca2+ influx. (b) Divalent cations (Ba2+ greater than Sr2+ greater than Ln3+ greater than Mn2+) replace Ca2+ and support ATP-induced release similar to their effectiveness in supporting bradykinin- and K+ (50 mM)-induced release in PC-12 cells (Weiss, C., Sela, D., and Atlas, D. (1990) Neurosci. Lett. 119, 241-245). Combined together the absolute requirement of [Ca2+]ex for release, inhibition of release by Gd3+ (IC50 = 100 microM), Ni2+, and Co2+ (IC50 = 1 mM), and support of release by Ba2+, Sr2+, and Mn2+, we suggest that ATP induces Ca2+ entry via ligand-operated Ca2+ channels as previously suggested for ATP in smooth muscle cells (Benham, C.D., Bolton, T.B., Byren, N.G., and Large, W.A. (1987) J. Physiol. (Lond.) 387, 473-488). No significant inhibition by 1 microM verapamil, 10 microM nifedipine, or 2 mM Cd2+ argues against ATP activation of voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels as similarly shown for ATP-induced [3H]noradrenaline release (Inoue, K., Nakazawa, K., Fujimoro, K., and Takanaka, A. (1989) Neurosci. Lett. 106, 294-299). Thus, the widely distributed ATP receptor might play an essential role in Ca2+ homeostasis of the cell by introducing Ca2+ into the cell via specific ligand-gated Ca2+ channels."

Monoclonal antibody VD2(1) against the beta subunit of the dihydropyridine receptor from skeletal muscle specifically immunoprecipitated up to 86% of the 125I-omega-conotoxin receptor solubilized from brain membranes whereas specific antibodies against the alpha 1, alpha 2, and gamma subunits did not precipitate the brain receptor. Purified skeletal muscle dihydropyridine receptor inhibited the immunoprecipitation of the brain omega-conotoxin receptor by monoclonal antibody VD2(1). The dihydropyridine receptor from rabbit brain membranes was also precipitated by monoclonal antibody VD2(1). However, neither the neuronal ryanodine receptor nor the sodium channel was precipitated by monoclonal antibody VD2(1). The omega-conotoxin receptor immunoprecipitated by monoclonal antibody VD2(1) showed high affinity 125I-omega-conotoxin binding, which was inhibited by unlabeled omega-contoxin and by CaCl2 but not by nitrendipine or by diltiazem. An antibody against the beta subunit of the skeletal muscle dihydropyridine receptor stained 58- and 78-kDa proteins on immunoblot of the omega-conotoxin receptor, partially purified through heparin-agarose chromatography and VD2(1)-Sepharose chromatography. These results suggest that the brain omega-conotoxin-sensitive calcium channel contains a component homologous to the beta subunit of the dihydropyridine-sensitive calcium channel of skeletal muscle and brain."
https://openalex.org/W1579434350,"Abstract A cDNA for the catalytic subunit of a calmodulin (CaM)-dependent protein phosphatase was cloned from Neurospora crassa. The open reading frame of 1557 base pairs encoded a protein of Mr approximately 59,580 and was followed by a 3'-untranslated region of 363 base pairs including the poly(A) tail. Based on primer extension analysis, the mRNA transcript in vivo was 2403 base pairs. Expression of this CaM-protein phosphatase mRNA was developmentally regulated, being highest during early mycelial growth; production of the corresponding protein followed mRNA with a time lag of 8-12 h. Polymerase chain reaction amplification of genomic DNA revealed three small introns, the positions of which coincided with those in the mouse gene, indicating evolutionary conservation of these structures. The deduced sequence showed approximately 75% identity with the mammalian homologue, calcineurin, in aligned regions. A region of 40 amino acids preceding the CaM-binding domain was essentially unchanged, suggesting conservation of a crucial interaction site. Three small segments in the carboxyl half of the protein were unrelated to the mammalian gene and may constitute variable regions that confer substrate specificity to the enzyme. An active recombinant catalytic subunit was expressed in bacteria and purified by CaM-Sepharose chromatography. This preparation was stimulated 2- 3-fold by CaM and showed a p-nitrophenol phosphatase activity equal to that of the bovine brain holoenzyme, although its dephosphorylation of phosphoprotein substrates was markedly different. These findings demonstrate that the catalytic subunit of this phosphatase can exhibit high activity in the absence of its intrinsic Ca(2+)-binding subunit."
https://openalex.org/W1913902802,"The Ca2+ signal observed in individual fura-2-loaded hepatocytes stimulated with the alpha 1-adrenergic agonist phenylephrine consisted of a variable latency period, a rapid biphasic increase in the cytosolic free Ca2+, followed by a period of maintained elevated cytosolic Ca2+ (plateau phase) that depended on the continued presence of both agonist and external Ca2+. Microinjection of guanosine-5'-O-(3-thiophosphate) elicited a Ca2+ transient with the same basic features. The Ca2+ transient resulting from microinjecting inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (Ins-1,4,5-P3) occurred with essentially no latency period and consisted of a rapid spike that decayed back to preinjection levels within 15 s. Microinjection of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphorothioate (thio-IP3), a nonmetabolizable analog of Ins-1,4,5-P3, elicited a Ca2+ transient that was initially identical to that observed with Ins-1,4,5-P3, except that the cytosolic Ca2+ remained elevated. The maintained thio-IP3-induced Ca2+ increase was dependent on the presence of external Ca2+, suggesting an activation of Ca2+ influx. Reintroduction of external Ca2+ in the presence of 5 microM phenylephrine to Ca(2+)-depleted cells resulted in a 2-fold greater rate of rise in the cytosolic Ca2+ compared to the rate observed upon Ca2+ addition to cells Ca(2+)-depleted by preatement with thapsigargin. The rate of Ca2+ rise upon Ca2+ addition to cells microinjected with thio-IP3 was similar to that observed with phenylephrine. Coinjection of the cells with thio-IP3 plus heparin reduced the rate of Ca2+ rise upon Ca2+ addition to that observed in thapsigargin-treated cells. These data indicate that the mechanism responsible for receptor-mediated stimulation of Ca2+ entry into hepatocytes involves not only capacitative Ca2+ entry but also an additional component mediated directly by Ins-1,4,5-P3."
https://openalex.org/W1481510532,"In man, the plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 (PAI-1) gene codes for two mRNA species, one of 3.2 kilobases (kb) and the other of 2.4 kb. We report that the protein kinase C activating phorbol ester, phorbol 12-myristate-13-acetate (PMA), causes a different induction of the two PAI-1 mRNA species in the human hepatoma cell line, HepG2. Upon addition of 100 nM PMA, the level of the 3.2-kb PAI-1 mRNA species increased to 25-fold after 3 h, and then declined rapidly. The level of the 2.4-kb species increased more slowly and reached a maximal 18-fold stimulation after 6 h, followed by a gradual decrease towards control levels. Run-on analysis showed that PMA induces a transient 40-fold increase in PAI-1 gene transcription rate. The relative concentration of the two PAI-1 mRNA species in the nuclei of PMA-treated HepG2 cells shifted towards the 2.4-kb form, suggesting that changes in transcription termination site and/or post-transcriptional nuclear processing might contribute to their different accumulation. Also, the two mRNAs differ in turnover rate, with a half-life of about 0.85 h for the 3.2-kb form and a half-life of about 2.5 h for the 2.4-kb form. By itself, cycloheximide had no effect on PAI-1 gene transcription rate or PAI-1 mRNA levels in HepG2. When added 1 h prior to PMA, however, cycloheximide prevented the induction of PAI-1 mRNA, which suggests that PMA exerts its stimulating transcriptional activity through a newly synthesized regulatory protein. When cycloheximide was added 2 h after PMA, when the PAI-1 gene transcription rate was maximally increased, the two PAI-1 mRNAs reached even higher levels than with PMA alone and maximal mRNA levels were maintained for a much longer period (up to 8 h). Thus, ongoing protein synthesis is required for both the induction and the transient nature of the PMA-induced PAI-1 mRNA accumulation. We conclude that the differential accumulation of the two PAI-1 mRNAs by PMA in serum-starved HepG2 cells is due both to changes in transcription termination and/or post-transcriptional nuclear processing and to differences in half-life between the two mRNAs in a process that requires ongoing protein synthesis.

https://openalex.org/W1554747241,"Promoters in Escherichia coli that are negatively regulated by the CytR repressor are also activated by the cAMP receptor protein (CRP) complexed to cAMP; as a characteristic, these promoters encode two binding sites for the cAMP.CRP complex. Biochemical and genetic studies have shown that CytR relies on interactions with the cAMP.CRP complex in order to bind promoter DNA and repress transcription. Here we have purified CytR to near homogeneity and addressed the question of how it interacts with the deoP2 promoter. Gel retardation and DNase I footprinting analyses show that CytR is a true sequence-specific DNA-binding protein that binds to the sequence between the two CRP sites in deoP2 with a relatively low affinity. In the presence of the cAMP.CRP complex the two protein species bind cooperatively to deoP2, forming a complex in which CytR occupies the sequence between the two DNA bound cAMP.CRP complexes. Furthermore, the inducer (cytidine) does not affect independent DNA binding of CytR, rather the CytR/cAMP.CRP cooperativity is perturbed. These results indicate that CytR binding to deoP2 relies on both repressor-DNA interactions and protein-protein interactions to cAMP.CRP. This combinatorial repression mechanism, in which an activator functions as an adaptor for a repressor that is not capable of blocking transcription on its own, is unprecedented in prokaryotes; it is, however, reminiscent of repression mechanisms found in eukaryotes."
https://openalex.org/W1606012550,"The spectral parameters, the orientation of the g tensor in two-dimensionally ordered multilayers and the relaxation properties of the Rieske center in purified cytochrome b6f complex from spinach were studied by EPR spectroscopy. A trough at g = 1.76 - 1.74 was unambiguously identified as the gx signal on the basis of the sensitivity of its field position to inhibitors and oxidized plastoquinone. In contrast to previous reports, the orientation of the chloroplast Rieske center was found to be identical to that of its cytochrome bc1 counterpart, provided that non-saturating EPR conditions were applied. Upon onset of microwave saturation, however, the orientation with respect to the ordered multilayers where the gy signal (g = 1.9) was maximal, changed drastically and was then similar to the orientation reported previously (Prince R. C., Crowder, M. S., and Bearden, A. J. (1980) Biochim. Biophys. Acta 592, 323-337). The unusually anisotropic saturation behavior of the EPR spectrum was characterized in detail, whereby hitherto controversial results on the spectral parameters of the chloroplast Rieske center could be rationalized. The observed phenomena are discussed on the basis of three tentative models which are able to qualitatively explain the effects."
https://openalex.org/W1515464859,"Biosynthetic pathways to bile acids have been studied in HepG2 cells, a well-differentiated human hepatoblastoma cell line. Cholesterol metabolites, in total 29, were isolated from culture media and cells by liquid-solid extraction and anion-exchange chromatography and were identified by gas-liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. The production rates/concentrations of cholic acid (CA) and chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA) in media from control cells were 71 and 74 ng/10(7) cells/h, respectively. Major bile acid precursors were 3 alpha, 7 alpha, 12 alpha-trihydroxy-5 beta-cholestanoic acid (THCA), 7 alpha, 12 alpha-dihydroxy-3-oxo-4-cholestenoic acid, 7 alpha-hydroxy-3-oxo-4-cholenoic acid, and 7 alpha, 12 alpha-dihydroxy-3-oxo-5 beta-cholanoic acid, their concentrations being 60, 30, 23, and 10 ng/10(7) cells/h, respectively. These and nine other isolated intermediates formed essentially complete metabolic sequences from cholesterol to CA and CDCA. The remaining steroids were metabolites of the intermediates or autooxidation products of cholesterol. These findings and the observed effect of dexamethasone on production rates suggest that in HepG2 cells the major biosynthetic pathways to primary bile acids start with 7 alpha-hydroxylation of cholesterol and oxidation to 7 alpha-hydroxy-4-cholesten-3-one followed by hydroxylation at either the 26 or 12 alpha position. CDCA is formed by the sequence of 26-hydroxylation, oxidation, and degradation of the side chain and A-ring reduction. CA is formed by the sequence of 12 alpha-hydroxylation, 26-hydroxylation, oxidation, and degradation of the side chain and reduction of the A-ring. An alternative pathway to CA included A-ring reduction of the intermediate 7 alpha, 12 alpha-dihydroxy-3-oxo-4-cholestenoic acid to form THCA prior to side chain cleavage. These pathways are not limited to HepG2 cells but may also be important in humans."
https://openalex.org/W1543195720,"As the primary and preferred energy source of normal colonic epithelial cells, fatty acids may play a unique role in the differentiation and physiology of these cells. We have shown that expression levels of COXIII, a mitochondrial gene encoding one of the 13 subunits of cytochrome c oxidase, are abnormally low in colon tumors and colonic tissue at genetic risk for developing tumors but increase following in vitro treatment of HT29 human colonic adenocarcinoma cells with the fatty acid butyrate. The present studies investigate the specificity of fatty acids in effecting cytochrome c oxidase subunit expression and enzymatic activity in HT29 cells. The data demonstrate that, depending upon their chain length, metabolizable unbranched fatty acids increase expression of two subunits encoded by mitochondrial genes (I and III) and enhance cytochrome c oxidase activity. However, none of the fatty acids had an effect on expression of two subunits encoded by nuclear genes (IV and Va). These findings suggest that the low levels of COXIII expression exhibited in colonic tumors may represent a limiting factor in the assembly of functional cytochrome c oxidase and contribute to the depressed enzyme activity reported in these tumors. By elevating expression of subunits I and III and enzymatic activity, fatty acids may enhance the potential for cellular respiration. The more differentiated phenotype which is reported in colorectal carcinoma cell lines treated with fatty acids in vitro may be, therefore, associated with correction of metabolic abnormalities in transformed cells."

(1987) J. Biol. Chem. 262, 9444-9447). Phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphatase catalyzes the analogous reaction utilizing phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate (PtdIns(3)P) as substrate to form phosphatidylinositol and inorganic phosphate (Lips, D.L., and Majerus, P.W. (1989) J. Biol. Chem. 264, 19911-19915). We now demonstrate that these enzyme activities are identical. Two forms of the enzyme, designated Type I and II 3-phosphatases, were isolated from rat brain. The Type I 3-phosphatase consisted of a protein doublet that migrated at a relative Mr of 65,000 upon sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS)-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The Mr of this isoform upon size-exclusion chromatography was 110,000, suggesting that the native enzyme is a dimer. The Type II enzyme consisted of equal amounts of an Mr = 65,000 doublet and an Mr = 78,000 band upon SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. This isoform displayed an Mr upon size-exclusion chromatography of 147,000, indicating that it is a heterodimer. The Type II 3-phosphatase catalyzed the hydrolysis of Ins(1,3)P2 with a catalytic efficiency of one-nineteenth of that measured for the Type I enzyme, whereas PtdIns(3)P was hydrolyzed by the Type II 3-phosphatase at three times the rate measured for the Type I 3-phosphatase. The Mr = 65,000 subunits of the two forms of 3-phosphatase appear to be the same based on co-migration on SDS-polyacrylamide gels and peptide maps generated with Staphylococcus aureus protease V8 and trypsin. The peptide map of the Mr = 78,000 subunit was different from that of the Mr = 65,000 subunits. Thus, we propose that the differing relative specificities of the Type I and II 3-phosphatases for Ins(1,3)P2 and PtdIns(3)P are due to the presence of the Mr = 78,000 subunit of the Type II enzyme."

Strikingly, vascular smooth muscle utilizes alternative RNA processing of the alpha-1 gene to express a structurally distinct Mr approximately 65,000 isoform, alpha 1-T (truncated). Analysis of both its mRNA and protein structure reveals that alpha-1-T represents a major, evolutionarily conserved, truncated Na+,K(+)-ATPase isoform expressed in vascular smooth muscle.

Tailoring of an efficient ribosome binding site in front of the gene by polymerase chain reaction led to a high level heat-inducible expression of the corresponding gene product (P1) in Escherichia coli cells. Expression was confirmed in vivo by complementation of phage PRD1 DNA polymerase gene mutants and in vitro by formation of the genome terminal protein P8-dGMP replication initiation complex. Expressed PRD1 DNA polymerase was purified to apparent homogeneity in an active form. DNA polymerase, 3'-5'-exonuclease, and P8-dGMP replication initiation complex formation activities cosedimented in glycerol gradient with a protein of 65 kDa, the size expected for PRD1 DNA polymerase. The DNA polymerase was active on DNase I-activated calf thymus DNA, poly(dA).oligo(dT) and poly(dA-dT) primer/templates as well as on native phage PRD1 genome. The 3'-5'-exonuclease activity was specific for single-stranded DNA and released mononucleotides. No 5'-3'-exonuclease activity was detected. The inhibitor/activator spectrum of the PRD1 DNA polymerase was also studied. An in vitro replication system with purified components for bacteriophage PRD1 was established. Formation of the P8-dGMP replication initiation complex was a prerequisite for phage DNA replication, which proceeded from the initiation complex and yielded genome length replication products."
https://openalex.org/W1574250061,"The bimG11 allele causes a conditional growth defect in the fungus Aspergillus nidulans preventing both progression through mitosis and normal polar growth. Previously, we have shown that the bimG11 mutation increases the phosphorylation of nuclear proteins and that the gene encodes a protein similar to mammalian type 1 protein phosphatase. Assay of protein phosphatase activity in protein extracts of Aspergillus demonstrates directly that type 1 phosphatase activity is greatly reduced in the mutant at restrictive temperature. Expression of a muscle type 1 protein phosphatase fully complements all aspects of the bimG11 phenotype, and restores the level of PP1 activity to nearly normal. Expression of the related phosphatase, PP2A, does not complement the bimG11 mutation, showing that complementation can only be achieved by the type 1 gene. This clearly demonstrates that the phenotype of bimG11 is due to reduced PP1 activity and that the PP1 catalytic subunit is functionally conserved over a wide span of evolution."
https://openalex.org/W1496777107,"To facilitate an understanding of the molecular events associated with vascular smooth muscle cells (SMC) growth arrest and differentiation, we have isolated a number of cDNAs encoding mRNAs that are more abundantly expressed in high density growth-arrested SMC. From 40,000 recombinant plaques, we identified 6 cDNA clones which encoded genes more highly expressed in density-arrested SMC. DNA sequence analysis of a cDNA clone which hybridized to a 5.5-kilobase mRNA revealed a 96% sequence homology to the carboxyl-terminal propeptide region of the human alpha 2(I) collagen gene. Sequence analysis of 3 other cDNA clones which all recognized a 1-kilobase mRNA, indicated that they encode the ferritin H-chain subunit gene. The large increase in ferritin H-chain mRNA expression was both growth arrest and high density-dependent, but did not appear to be cell-cell contact-dependent. The increase in H-chain was partially accounted for by an increase in the transcription of this gene, but a post-transcriptional mechanism likely accounts for the majority of the observed difference in mRNA level. A greater than 3-fold higher expression of ferritin H-chain mRNA was also observed in BC3H1s (a nonfusing myogenic cell line) during the process of differentiation, but no elevation in ferritin H-chain mRNA was associated with density-dependent growth arrest in fibroblasts. Hemin (an intracellular iron donor) induced an elevation in ferritin H-chain mRNA expression in both preconfluent and post-confluent SMC, but was unable to elevate the preconfluent mRNA level to an untreated postconfluent level. In addition, deferoxamine (an intracellular iron chelator) was unable to reduce the ferritin mRNA level in postconfluent SMC. These results suggest that high density growth arrest-mediated elevation in ferritin H-chain occurs by a mechanism distinct from that induced by an increase in intracellular iron. cAMP was also a powerful modulator of the expression of ferritin H-chain gene since cells treated with forskolin or dibutyryl cAMP had a 5-7-fold higher level of ferritin H-chain mRNA. We propose that the increase in the ferritin H-chain mRNA level in postconfluent SMC may occur through a cAMP-dependent pathway and may be associated with an enhanced differentiated phenotype."

https://openalex.org/W1534995893,"The activation of phospholipase D by platelet-activating factor (PAF) in the human promonocytic cell line U937 has been investigated. In cells prelabeled with [3H]palmitic acid, addition of PAF or phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) induced the synthesis of [3H]phosphatidylethanol, indicating phospholipase D activation. When U937 cells were preincubated for 5 min with PMA, and then stimulated with PAF, formation of phosphatidylethanol was greatly enhanced. In contrast, under the same experimental conditions PMA treatment blocked completely the PAF-induced inositol phosphates formation in cells prelabeled with [3H]inositol. Thus, PMA treatment demonstrates that phospholipase D activation can occur independently from phosphoinositide-specific phospholipase C activation during PAF stimulation in U937 cells. On the other hand, the data herein presented suggest that influx of external calcium is required for phospholipase D activation by PAF, as assessed by complete inhibition of the enzyme activity by chelation of extracellular calcium or by treatment with the calcium channel blocker verapamil. Based on these findings, a hypothetical model for phospholipase D activation is discussed."

In order to eliminate fusion proteins the XbaI/ClaI fragment which contained the PAH gene from the Bluescript construct was subcloned into pMAC 5-8 containing the TAC promoter. The recombinant protein reacts with antibody raised to authentic C. violaceum PAH and its NH2-terminal 20-amino acid sequence and COOH-terminal amino acid residue were identical with the wild-type protein. Key physical and chemical characteristics of the recombinant protein, i.e. its copper content and Michaelis-Menten parameters, were the same as wild-type. Comparison of amino acid sequences revealed a highly conserved region between C. violaceum PAH and three different mammalian aromatic amino acid hydroxylases.

Cyanogen bromide fragments (CF) of apoAI (CF1-CF4) were complexed with phospholipid, and their ability to associate with the receptor was compared in various binding studies. Careful analysis of the concentration-dependent association of 125I-labeled dimyristoyl phosphatidylcholine (DMPC) recombinants to rat liver plasma membranes revealed high and low affinity binding components. As all DMPC recombinants displayed the low affinity binding component, it was postulated that this interaction was independent of the protein present in the particle and may well represent a lipid-lipid or lipid-protein association with the membranes. Only 125I-labeled CF4.DMPC displayed a high affinity binding component with similar Kd and Bmax (8 x 10(-9) M, 1.6 x 10(-12) mol/mg plasma membrane protein) to that of 125I-labeled AI.DMPC (7 x 10(-9), 1.4 x 10(-12) mol/mg plasma membrane protein). Similarly, egg yolk phosphatidylcholine complexes containing CF4 (CF4.egg PC) showed higher affinity binding than CF1-egg yolk phosphatidylcholine complexes confirming the results obtained with DMPC complexes. Furthermore, ligand blotting studies showed that only 125I-labeled CF4.DMPC associated specifically with HB1 and HB2, two HDL binding proteins recently identified in rat liver plasma membranes. We conclude that a region within the carboxyl-terminus of apoAI is responsible for the interaction with putative HDL receptors present in rat liver plasma membranes."
https://openalex.org/W1518316911,"Solutions of each of three different globular proteins (cytochrome c, chromophorically labeled serum albumin, and chromophorically labeled aldolase), mixed with another unlabeled globular protein or with fibrous actin, were prepared in pH 8.0 Tris-HCl buffer containing 0.15 M NaCl. Each solution was centrifuged at low speed, at 5 degrees C, until unassociated globular protein in solution achieved sedimentation equilibrium. Individual absorbance gradients of both macrosolutes in the mixtures subsequent to centrifugation were obtained via optical scans of the centrifuge tubes at two wavelengths. The gradients of each macrosolute in mixtures of two globular proteins revealed no association of globular proteins under the conditions of these experiments, but perturbation of the gradients of serum albumin, aldolase, and cytochrome c in the presence of F-actin indicated association of all three globular proteins with F-actin. Perturbation of actin gradients in the presence of serum albumin and aldolase suggested partial depolymerization of the F-actin by the globular protein. Analysis of the data with a simple phenomenological model relating free globular protein, bound globular protein, and total actin concentration provided estimates of the respective equilibrium constants for association of serum albumin and aldolase with F-actin, under the conditions of these experiments, of the order of 0.1 microM-1."
https://openalex.org/W1509794426,"We have used an interleukin-2 (IL-2) promoter-CAT fusion gene to study activation of IL-2 gene expression by IL-1, phytohemagglutinin (PHA), phorbol myristate acetate (PMA), and calcium ionophore in the murine thymoma line EL4 and the human lymphoma line Jurkat. The two cell lines respond differently to combinations of these stimuli. IL-1 in combination with suboptimal concentration of PMA induced chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) activity in EL4. In Jurkat cells, IL-1 failed to synergize with PMA or PHA. Cotransfection with the IL-2/CAT gene and a construct capable of expressing murine T-cell type IL-1 receptors converted Jurkat cells to IL-1 responsiveness. IL-1 in combination with PHA but not with PMA resulted in induction of CAT activity in these cells. Induction of IL-2/CAT activity by all stimuli in both cell lines was blocked by the presence of EGTA in the culture medium. EGTA did not inhibit IL-1/PMA activation of an SV40 early promoter-CAT fusion gene in either EL4 or Jurkat cells; therefore, calcium was not required for IL-1 or PMA signal transduction. Jurkat cells were shown to differ from EL4 in their requirement for calcium mobilization. Two different calcium-dependent pathways of gene activation were distinguished, both of which were blocked by the immunosuppressive drug cyclosporin A."
https://openalex.org/W1610785202,"In Xanthomonas campestris pv. campestris, fructose is transported and phosphorylated into fructose 1-phosphate through a phosphoenolpyruvate-dependent phosphotransferase system. The nucleotide sequence of the fruA gene encoding the phosphotransferase system permease specific of fructose (EIIFru) was determined. The fructose 1-phosphate produced by the phosphotransferase system is phosphorylated into fructose 1,6-bisphosphate by a 1-phosphofructokinase. This enzyme was characterized and the corresponding gene (fruK) was sequenced. Sequence comparisons revealed that FruK is a member of a new family of ATP-binding proteins composed of sugar (or sugar-phosphate) kinases. In phosphotransferase system-deficient strains, fructose can still be transported by an unidentified permease. The intracellular fructose is then phosphorylated by a multimeric fructokinase of 135 kDa specific for fructose and inhibited by fructose, fructose 1,6-bisphosphate, and mannose. Several other enzymes of fructose metabolism were assayed and a potential pathway for fructose catabolism is presented."
https://openalex.org/W1485864214,"Okadaic acid, a potent inhibitor of Type 1 and Type 2A protein phosphatases, was used to investigate the mechanism of insulin action on membrane-bound low Km cAMP phosphodiesterase in rat adipocytes. Upon incubation of cells with 1 microM okadaic acid for 20 min, phosphodiesterase was stimulated 3.7- to 3.9-fold. This stimulation was larger than that elicited by insulin (2.5- to 3.0-fold). Although okadaic acid enhanced the effect of insulin, the maximum effects of the two agents were not additive. When cells were pretreated with 1-(5-isoquinolinylsulfonyl)-2-methylpiperazine (H-7), the level of phosphodiesterase stimulation by okadaic acid was rendered smaller, similar to that attained by insulin. In cells that had been treated with 2 mM KCN, okadaic acid (like insulin) failed to stimulate phosphodiesterase, suggesting that ATP was essential. Also, as reported previously, the effect of insulin on phosphodiesterase was reversed upon exposure of hormone-treated cells to KCN. This deactivation of previously-stimulated phosphodiesterase was blocked by okadaic acid, but not by insulin. The above KCN experiments were carried out with cells in which A-kinase activity was minimized by pretreatment with H-7. Okadaic acid mildly stimulated basal glucose transport and, at the same time, strongly inhibited the action of insulin thereon. It is suggested that insulin may stimulate phosphodiesterase by promoting its phosphorylation and that the hormonal effect may be reversed by a protein phosphatase which is sensitive to okadaic acid. The hypothetical protein kinase thought to be involved in the insulin-dependent stimulation of phosphodiesterase appears to be more H-7-resistant than A-kinase."
https://openalex.org/W1591287059,"These studies were initiated to determine whether the soluble, truncated form of the nerve growth factor (NGF) receptor arises from post-translational processing of the intact, membrane-bound receptor or from an alternatively spliced mRNA. Pulse-chase analysis of cultured primary rat Schwann cells coupled with immunoprecipitations using antibodies to the intracellular and extracellular domains of the receptor were used to monitor receptor production. Three forms of the NGF receptor (80, 83, and 85 kDa) displaying a precursor product relationship were detected over the 2-h chase period; only the 85-kDa species was detected on the cell surface. Truncated receptors (50 and 52 kDa) were detected in conditioned media 5 h after cell labeling but were never observed intracellularly. Polymerase chain reaction and RNase protection analyses of NGF receptor mRNA targeted toward the coding region for the transmembrane domain detected no splice variants that could generate truncated receptor, and media conditioned by fibroblasts transfected with rat receptor cDNA, in which splicing cannot occur, nonetheless contained the truncated receptor protein. Taken together, these results suggest that the truncated NGF receptor does not arise as a distinct translation product but rather from a post-translational modification of the intact, surface-bound form of the protein."
https://openalex.org/W1482992036,"Abstract Anion transport inhibitors, such as SITS (4-acetamido-4'-isothiocyanostilbene-2,2'-disulfonic acid) and heparin, inhibit reversibly the bicarbonate-sensitive adenylylcyclase of porcine sperm plasma membrane. In the light of this, SITS- and heparin-affinity chromatographies were applied in order to purify sperm adenylylcyclase. SITS-Affi-Gel 102 binds proteins extracted from the porcine cauda epididymal sperm plasma membrane by Lubrol-PX, more selectively than heparin-agarose. However, recovery of adenylylcyclase activity is higher when heparin-agarose is used. The hormone-sensitive liver adenylylcyclase, which is less sensitive to bicarbonate than sperm enzyme, has less affinity for these affinity resins than sperm enzyme. Adenylylcyclase can be purified to apparent homogeneity on two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (isoelectric focusing/sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis) from the Lubrol-PX extract of the purified sperm plasma membrane by using SITS-affinity chromatography at the first step of the purification followed by preparative isoelectric focusing and gel filtration. The molecular weight and pI of the purified enzyme are 46,300 and 6.9, respectively. The purified enzyme activity is highly dependent on Mn2+. Bicarbonate activates even the purified enzyme both by decreasing Km and by increasing Vmax."
https://openalex.org/W2156192484,"Thrombomodulin, a cofactor in the thrombin-catalyzed activation of protein C, blocks the procoagulant activities of thrombin such as fibrinogen clotting, Factor V activation, and platelet activation. The binding site for thrombomodulin within human thrombin has been localized at a region comprising residues Thr147-Ser158 of the B-chain of thrombin. The dodecapeptide sequence, TWTANVGKGQPS, corresponding to these residues inhibits thrombin binding to thrombomodulin with an apparent Ki = 94 microM (Suzuki, K., Nishioka, J., and Hayashi, T. (1990) J. Biol. Chem. 265, 13263-13267). We have found that the inhibitory effect of the dodecapeptide on the thrombin-thrombomodulin interaction is sequence-specific, and that residues Asn151, Lys154, and Gln156 are essential for thrombomodulin binding. The dodecapeptide was also found to directly block thrombin procoagulant activities, fibrinogen clotting (concentration for half-maximum inhibition, 385 microM). Factor V activation (concentration for half-maximum inhibition, 33 microM), and platelet activation (concentration for half-maximum inhibition, 645 microM). This peptide did not block thrombin inhibition by antithrombin III, but blocked thrombin inhibition by hirudin. These findings suggest that the binding site for thrombomodulin in thrombin is shared with the sites for fibrinogen, Factor V, platelets, and hirudin, and that, therefore, the inhibition of thrombin procoagulant activities by thrombomodulin in part results from blocking of the interaction between thrombin and the procoagulant protein substrates by thrombomodulin."
https://openalex.org/W1676799115,"Cloned atp genes for the proton-translocating ATPase of the obligate aerobe Bacillus megaterium have been demonstrated to be capable of complementing Escherichia coli ATPase (unc) mutants (Hawthorne, C. A., and Brusilow, W. S. A. (1986) J. Biol. Chem. 261, 5245-5248). To determine the minimum subunit requirements for cross-species complementation, we constructed all combinations of B. megaterium atpA, G, D, and C genes (coding for the alpha, gamma, beta, and epsilon subunits, respectively) and tested their abilities to complement two uncA (alpha subunit) and two uncD (beta subunit) mutants of E. coli. The results indicated that complementation of either uncD mutant required atpD (beta) only. Complementation of one of the uncA (alpha) mutants required atpA, G, and D (alpha, gamma, and beta) and possibly atpE (epsilon) as well. The other uncA mutant was not complemented by any combination of B. megaterium ATPase genes. Complementation of a beta mutant by atpD (beta) or atpD and C (beta epsilon) produced cells which could grow aerobically on a nonfermentable carbon source (succinate) but not anaerobically on rich medium containing glucose. These E. coli therefore had become obligate aerobes. The ability to grow anaerobically could be restored to the mutant complemented by atpD alone by growth at pH 7.5 or pH 8 in the presence of 0.1 M potassium."

The mass of this protein was estimated at 18 kDa by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and 17 kDa by gel filtration. The binding of VIP by this protein was inhibited by Mg2+, covalent cross-linking of [Tyr10-125I]VIP to the protein produced two radioactive bands at 22 and 26 kDa identified by electrophoresis, and the purified protein exhibited saturable and high affinity binding of VIP and the related neuropeptide, rat growth hormone releasing factor."
https://openalex.org/W1559399361,"Yeast SOC8 DNA fragment was isolated as a wild type dominant suppressor of cdc8 mutation. We have used Bal31 deletion analysis to define the minimal 1 kilobase HpaI-NcoI DNA element required for complementing the cdc8 mutation. The complementing sequence harbored a multicopy plasmid also enhanced by uridine monophosphate kinase in crude extracts. DNA sequence analysis revealed an open reading frame encoding a protein with a molecular weight of 24,949. Since our SOC8 sequence was identical to that of URA6 gene, which encodes uridine monophosphate kinase, we conclude that SOC8 is allelic with URA6, and we use the term URA6 hereafter. Northern blotting experiments showed that the size of mRNA is about 0.9 kibobases. Primer extension experiments showed multiple transcriptional starting sites primarily located at -160 The size and the deduced amino acid composition are consistent with information obtained from purified uridine monophosphate kinase. Thus, both molecular genetic and biochemical evidence supports a notion that the URA6 is SOC8 encoding a yeast uridine monophosphate kinase. Mutagenesis analysis of its putative nucleotide-binding site, altering essential lysine to glutamic acid, resulted in loss of its uridine monophosphate kinase activity. Complementation analysis studies indicated that the mutated ura6 gene abolished its ability to complement ura6 mutant cells; nor could it suppress cdc8 mutation. Unlike CDC8, the mRNA level of the URA6 gene did not fluctuate throughout the cell cycle; presumably, the temporal order of these two enzymatic activities might be different during cell cycle progression. These data may explain an incomplete suppression of cdc8 by URA6, as previously observed. Taken together, the results support our previous speculation that the suppression of the cdc8 mutation mechanisms by URA6 is due to the provision of the trans-acting dTMP kinase activity to complement the cdc8 defect."
https://openalex.org/W1489666943,"The zinc ion in bovine heart cytochrome c oxidase can be completely depleted from the enzyme with mercuric chloride without denaturing the protein. The metal atom stoichiometry of 5Cu/4Fe/0Zn/2Mg obtained for the enzyme following HgCl2 treatment indicates that this depletion is highly selective. Zinc depletion exposes one cysteine on subunit VIa and one cysteine on subunit VIb for N-iodoacetyl-N'-(5-sulfo-1-naphthyl)ethylene-diamine (1,5-I-AEDANS) labelling, suggesting that the zinc plays a structural role in the protein by providing a bridge between these two subunits. Although the treatment of cytochrome c oxidase with mercuric chloride inhibits the steady-state activity of the enzyme, subsequent removal of the Hg2+ bound to cysteine residues by 1,5-I-AEDANS significantly reverses the inhibition. This latter result indicates that the removal of the zinc itself does not alter the steady-state activity of the enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W1532108093,"New spin-labeled analogs of nucleoside triphosphates, 8-amino(2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine-N-oxyl)adenosine 5'-triphosphate ((8-AmTEMPO)ATP) and 5-amino(2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine-N-oxyl)uridine 5'-triphosphate ((5-AmTEMPO)UTP), with the probe 4-amino(2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine-N-oxyl) (4-AmTEMPO) attached to C-8 of ATP and C-5 of UTP via a secondary amine bond, were synthesized in 50 and 40% yield, respectively. These analogs showed a single spot by thin layer chromatographic analysis. The absorption spectra of (8-Am-TEMPO)ATP and (5-AmTEMPO)UTP exhibit maxima at 310 and 265 nm, respectively; their X-band EPR spectra have a typical three-line pattern with lines at 3,221, 3,239, and 3,257 Gauss. The intensity ratios for mid to high field lines of the EPR derivative lines were found to be 1.03 +/- 0.02, 1.08 +/- 0.04, and 1.15 +/- 0.07 for 4-AmTEMPO, (8-AmTEMPO)ATP, and (5-AmTEMPO)UTP, respectively. The immobilization of 4-AmTEMPO bound to C-8 of ATP or bound to C-5 of UTP was observed to be 5 and 11%, respectively, as compared with free 4-AmTEMPO. The initial velocity (s-1) of [3H]UMP incorporation into RNA in the presence of [3H]UTP, CTP, GTP, and (8-AmTEMPO)ATP or ATP was measured. The percent incorporation of (8-AmTEMPO)ATP into RNA product by Escherichia coli RNA polymerase using various DNA templates is 68, 66, and 61% for pAR1435 (plasmid containing A1 promoter from T7 DNA), calf thymus DNA, and poly(dA-dT) respectively, as compared with ATP incorporation. The polymerase-catalyzed reaction of (8-AmTEMPO)ATP with (3'-OCH3)UTP yielded 5'-triphosphate delta-amino(2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine-N-oxyl)adenylyl (3'-5')3'-methoxy uridine in the presence of poly(dA-dT). The structure of this spin-labeled dinucleotide was identified by paper chromatographic analysis of the products of phosphodiesterase digestion. These analogs also can be used for the study by EPR spectroscopy of the dynamics of gene transcription catalyzed by RNA polymerases or of other nucleotide-utilizing enzymes."
