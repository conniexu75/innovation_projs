https://openalex.org/W2768823259,"Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells targeting CD19 mediate potent effects in relapsed and/or refractory pre-B cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL), but antigen loss is a frequent cause of resistance to CD19-targeted immunotherapy. CD22 is also expressed in most cases of B-ALL and is usually retained following CD19 loss. We report results from a phase 1 trial testing a new CD22-targeted CAR (CD22-CAR) in 21 children and adults, including 17 who were previously treated with CD19-directed immunotherapy. Dose-dependent antileukemic activity was observed, with complete remission obtained in 73% (11/15) of patients receiving ≥1 × 106 CD22-CAR T cells per kg body weight, including 5 of 5 patients with CD19dim or CD19- B-ALL. Median remission duration was 6 months. Relapses were associated with diminished CD22 site density that likely permitted CD22+ cell escape from killing by CD22-CAR T cells. These results are the first to establish the clinical activity of a CD22-CAR in B-ALL, including leukemia resistant to anti-CD19 immunotherapy, demonstrating potency against B-ALL comparable to that of CD19-CAR at biologically active doses. Our results also highlight the critical role played by antigen density in regulating CAR function."
https://openalex.org/W2769995426,"Methods for the targeted disruption of protein function have revolutionized science and greatly expedited the systematic characterization of genes. Two main approaches are currently used to disrupt protein function: DNA knockout and RNA interference, which act at the genome and mRNA level, respectively. A method that directly alters endogenous protein levels is currently not available. Here, we present Trim-Away, a technique to degrade endogenous proteins acutely in mammalian cells without prior modification of the genome or mRNA. Trim-Away harnesses the cellular protein degradation machinery to remove unmodified native proteins within minutes of application. This rapidity minimizes the risk that phenotypes are compensated and that secondary, non-specific defects accumulate over time. Because Trim-Away utilizes antibodies, it can be applied to a wide range of target proteins using off-the-shelf reagents. Trim-Away allows the study of protein function in diverse cell types, including non-dividing primary cells where genome- and RNA-targeting methods are limited."
https://openalex.org/W2768727455,"Statistically underpowered studies can result in experimental failure even when all other experimental considerations have been addressed impeccably. In fMRI the combination of a large number of dependent variables, a relatively small number of observations (subjects), and a need to correct for multiple comparisons can decrease statistical power dramatically. This problem has been clearly addressed yet remains controversial—especially in regards to the expected effect sizes in fMRI, and especially for between-subjects effects such as group comparisons and brain-behavior correlations. We aimed to clarify the power problem by considering and contrasting two simulated scenarios of such possible brain-behavior correlations: weak diffuse effects and strong localized effects. Sampling from these scenarios shows that, particularly in the weak diffuse scenario, common sample sizes (n = 20–30) display extremely low statistical power, poorly represent the actual effects in the full sample, and show large variation on subsequent replications. Empirical data from the Human Connectome Project resembles the weak diffuse scenario much more than the localized strong scenario, which underscores the extent of the power problem for many studies. Possible solutions to the power problem include increasing the sample size, using less stringent thresholds, or focusing on a region-of-interest. However, these approaches are not always feasible and some have major drawbacks. The most prominent solutions that may help address the power problem include model-based (multivariate) prediction methods and meta-analyses with related synthesis-oriented approaches."
https://openalex.org/W2770225202,"mTORC1 is a signal integrator and master regulator of cellular anabolic processes linked to cell growth and survival. Here, we demonstrate that mTORC1 promotes lipid biogenesis via SRPK2, a key regulator of RNA-binding SR proteins. mTORC1-activated S6K1 phosphorylates SRPK2 at Ser494, which primes Ser497 phosphorylation by CK1. These phosphorylation events promote SRPK2 nuclear translocation and phosphorylation of SR proteins. Genome-wide transcriptome analysis reveals that lipid biosynthetic enzymes are among the downstream targets of mTORC1-SRPK2 signaling. Mechanistically, SRPK2 promotes SR protein binding to U1-70K to induce splicing of lipogenic pre-mRNAs. Inhibition of this signaling pathway leads to intron retention of lipogenic genes, which triggers nonsense-mediated mRNA decay. Genetic or pharmacological inhibition of SRPK2 blunts de novo lipid synthesis, thereby suppressing cell growth. These results thus reveal a novel role of mTORC1-SRPK2 signaling in post-transcriptional regulation of lipid metabolism and demonstrate that SRPK2 is a potential therapeutic target for mTORC1-driven metabolic disorders."
https://openalex.org/W2768748191,"Pectin, an integral component of the plant cell wall, is a recalcitrant substrate against enzymatic challenges by most animals. In characterizing the source of a leaf beetle's (Cassida rubiginosa) pectin-degrading phenotype, we demonstrate its dependency on an extracellular bacterium housed in specialized organs connected to the foregut. Despite possessing the smallest genome (0.27 Mb) of any organism not subsisting within a host cell, the symbiont nonetheless retained a functional pectinolytic metabolism targeting the polysaccharide's two most abundant classes: homogalacturonan and rhamnogalacturonan I. Comparative transcriptomics revealed pectinase expression to be enriched in the symbiotic organs, consistent with enzymatic buildup in these structures following immunostaining with pectinase-targeting antibodies. Symbiont elimination results in a drastically reduced host survivorship and a diminished capacity to degrade pectin. Collectively, our findings highlight symbiosis as a strategy for an herbivore to metabolize one of nature's most complex polysaccharides and a universal component of plant tissues."
https://openalex.org/W2566689527,"Discussions of the hippocampus often focus on place cells, but many neurons are not place cells in any given environment. Here we describe the collective activity in such mixed populations, treating place and non-place cells on the same footing. We start with optical imaging experiments on CA1 in mice as they run along a virtual linear track, and use maximum entropy methods to approximate the distribution of patterns of activity in the population, matching the correlations between pairs of cells but otherwise assuming as little structure as possible. We find that these simple models accurately predict the activity of each neuron from the state of all the other neurons in the network, regardless of how well that neuron codes for position. These and other results suggest that place cells are not a distinct sub-network, but part of a larger system that encodes, collectively, more than just place information."
https://openalex.org/W2768455369,"RNA profiles are an informative phenotype of cellular and tissue states but can be costly to generate at massive scale. Here, we describe how gene expression levels can be efficiently acquired with random composite measurements-in which abundances are combined in a random weighted sum. We show (1) that the similarity between pairs of expression profiles can be approximated with very few composite measurements; (2) that by leveraging sparse, modular representations of gene expression, we can use random composite measurements to recover high-dimensional gene expression levels (with 100 times fewer measurements than genes); and (3) that it is possible to blindly recover gene expression from composite measurements, even without access to training data. Our results suggest new compressive modalities as a foundation for massive scaling in high-throughput measurements and new insights into the interpretation of high-dimensional data."
https://openalex.org/W2768367424,"Endosomal Toll-like receptors (TLR3, TLR7, TLR8, and TLR9) are highly analogous sensors for various viral or bacterial RNA and DNA molecular patterns. Nonetheless, few small molecules can selectively modulate these TLRs. In this manuscript, we identified the first human TLR8-specific small-molecule antagonists via a novel inhibition mechanism. Crystal structures of two distinct TLR8-ligand complexes validated a unique binding site on the protein-protein interface of the TLR8 homodimer. Upon binding to this new site, the small-molecule ligands stabilize the preformed TLR8 dimer in its resting state, preventing activation. As a proof of concept of their therapeutic potential, we have demonstrated that these drug-like inhibitors are able to suppress TLR8-mediated proinflammatory signaling in various cell lines, human primary cells, and patient specimens. These results not only suggest a novel strategy for TLR inhibitor design, but also shed critical mechanistic insight into these clinically important immune receptors."

Our approach of engineering the conserved processes of DNA replication, repair, and recombination could be automated and establishes a general strategy for multiplex combinatorial genome engineering in eukaryotes. Most eukaryotic genome-editing technologies—zinc-finger nucleases (ZFNs), transcription activator-like effector nucleases (TALENs), and CRISPR-Cas9—generate DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) at targeted loci to introduce genomic modifications (Chandrasegaran and Carroll, 2016Chandrasegaran S. Carroll D. Origins of programmable nucleases for genome engineering.J. Mol. Biol. 2016; 428: 963-989Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar, Doudna and Charpentier, 2014Doudna J.A. Charpentier E. Genome editing. The new frontier of genome engineering with CRISPR-Cas9.Science. 2014; 346: 1258096Crossref PubMed Scopus (3581) Google Scholar). Although ZFNs and TALENs recognize specific DNA sequences through protein-DNA interactions and use the FokI nuclease domain to introduce DSBs at genomic loci, construction of functional ZFNs and TALENs with desired DNA specificity remains laborious, costly, and primarily limited to modifications at a single locus. CRISPR-Cas9 has been broadly adopted for multiplexed targeting of genomic modifications because the nuclease Cas9 uses a short guide RNA to recognize the target DNA via Watson-Crick base-pairing (Jinek et al., 2012Jinek M. Chylinski K. Fonfara I. Hauer M. Doudna J.A. Charpentier E. A programmable dual-RNA-guided DNA endonuclease in adaptive bacterial immunity.Science. 2012; 337: 816-821Crossref PubMed Scopus (9327) Google Scholar) and has been shown to function in many organisms (Cong et al., 2013Cong L. Ran F.A. Cox D. Lin S. Barretto R. Habib N. Hsu P.D. Wu X. Jiang W. Marraffini L.A. Zhang F.

DiCarlo J.E. Norville J.E. Church G.M. RNA-guided human genome engineering via Cas9.Science. 2013; 339: 823-826Crossref PubMed Scopus (6424) Google Scholar). CRISPR-Cas9 is suited for gene disruption applications by non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) (Yang et al., 2015Yang L. Güell M. Niu D. George H. Lesha E. Grishin D. Aach J. Shrock E. Xu W. Poci J. et al.Genome-wide inactivation of porcine endogenous retroviruses (PERVs).Science. 2015; 350: 1101-1104Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar) and gene editing via homology-directed repair (HDR) (Doudna and Charpentier, 2014Doudna J.A. Charpentier E. Genome editing. The new frontier of genome engineering with CRISPR-Cas9.Science. 2014; 346: 1258096Crossref PubMed Scopus (3581) Google Scholar). For applications that require multisite editing or precise base-pair (bp)-level genome modifications by HDR, the DSB mechanism is limiting for three key reasons. First, cleaving the genome is cytotoxic, and cell lethality is magnified when DSBs are introduced across multiple target sites (Jakočiūnas et al., 2015Jakočiūnas T. Bonde I. Herrgård M. Harrison S.J. Kristensen M. Pedersen L.E. Jensen M.K. Keasling J.D. Multiplex metabolic pathway engineering using CRISPR/Cas9 in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.Metab. Eng. 2015; 28: 213-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). Second, in eukaryotes most single bp HDR changes introduced by DSB repair are subject to additional unwanted insertions or deletions (indels) resulting from NHEJ (Inui et al., 2014Inui M. Miyado M. Igarashi M. Tamano M. Kubo A. Yamashita S. Asahara H. Fukami M. Takada S. Rapid generation of mouse models with defined point mutations by the CRISPR/Cas9 system.Sci. Rep. 2014; 4: 5396Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). These additional mutations result from high tolerance of the targeted nuclease (i.e., Cas9:gRNA [guide RNA]) to mismatches in the DSB target, which can lead to additional cleavage even after HDR editing has occurred (Fu et al., 2013Fu Y. Foden J.A. Khayter C. Maeder M.L. Reyon D. Joung J.K. Sander J.D. High-frequency off-target mutagenesis induced by CRISPR-Cas nucleases in human cells.Nat. Biotechnol. 2013; 31: 822-826Crossref PubMed Scopus (2210) Google Scholar). For single-bp HDR, the inclusion of blocking mutations in the donor DNA is typically required to mask the genomic target site from further cutting by the Cas9:gRNA (Horwitz et al., 2015Horwitz A.A. Walter J.M. Schubert M.G. Kung S.H. Hawkins K. Platt D.M. Hernday A.D. Mahatdejkul-Meadows T. Szeto W. Chandran S.S. Newman J.D.

Kwart D. Chen A. Sproul A. Jacob S. Teo S. Olsen K.M. Gregg A. Noggle S. Tessier-Lavigne M. Efficient introduction of specific homozygous and heterozygous mutations using CRISPR/Cas9.Nature. 2016; 533: 125-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (540) Google Scholar). For many types of genetic elements (e.g., promoters, ncRNAs), the exact DNA sequence dictates function such that additional blocking mutations can be prohibitive. Despite the improved stringencies of engineered Cas9 variants, mismatches are still tolerated for many nonstandard target sites with repetitive regions (Tsai and Joung, 2016Tsai S.Q. Joung J.K. Defining and improving the genome-wide specificities of CRISPR-Cas9 nucleases.Nat. Rev. Genet. 2016; 17: 300-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). Third, the inefficiency of generating targeted single-bp edits with DSBs limits the ability to simultaneously modify many loci in a single cell or across a population to produce combinatorial genetic diversity for exploration of vast genomic landscapes. Efficient DNA base editing without a DSB has been reported using Cas9-guided deamination, but this technique is limited to specific C → T or G → A mutations in an imprecise window of several bps (Komor et al., 2016Komor A.C. Kim Y.B. Packer M.S. Zuris J.A. Liu D.R. Programmable editing of a target base in genomic DNA without double-stranded DNA cleavage.Nature. 2016; 533: 420-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (2385) Google Scholar). Thus, creating precise edits at single-bp resolution remains a defining challenge for eukaryotic genome engineering technologies. Prior work in Escherichia coli demonstrated that targeted chromosomal modifications could be introduced without DSBs using synthetic single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) oligodeoxynucleotides (ssODNs) complementary to the lagging strand of the replicating chromosome. High efficiencies (>10%) were achieved by using the phage λ Red Beta ssDNA annealing protein (SSAP) to facilitate ssODN annealing at the lagging strand during DNA replication (Costantino and Court, 2003Costantino N. Court D.L. Enhanced levels of lambda red-mediated recombinants in mismatch repair mutants.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2003; 100: 15748-15753Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). With the advent of multiplex automated genome engineering (MAGE), this approach was enhanced to generate multisite genome modifications with bp precision at increased efficiencies (>30%) and used for pathway diversification (Wang et al., 2009Wang H.H. Isaacs F.J. Carr P.A. Sun Z.Z. Xu G. Forest C.R. Church G.M. Programming cells by multiplex genome engineering and accelerated evolution.Nature. 2009; 460: 894-898Crossref PubMed Scopus (1148) Google Scholar), whole-genomic recoding (Lajoie et al., 2013Lajoie M.J.

Mosberg J.A. et al.Genomically recoded organisms expand biological functions.Science. 2013; 342: 357-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (570) Google Scholar), and molecular evolution of proteins (Amiram et al., 2015Amiram M.

Hong S.H. et al.Evolution of translation machinery in recoded bacteria enables multi-site incorporation of nonstandard amino acids.Nat. Biotechnol. 2015; 33: 1272-1279Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). In S. cerevisiae, homologous recombination (HR) of ssODNs results in low gene targeting efficiencies (∼10−4%–10−3%), which limits the scope of applications to single locus modifications (Kow et al., 2007Kow Y.W. Bao G. Reeves J.W. Jinks-Robertson S. Crouse G.F. Oligonucleotide transformation of yeast reveals mismatch repair complexes to be differentially active on DNA replication strands.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2007; 104: 11352-11357Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, Storici and Resnick, 2003Storici F. Resnick M.A. Delitto perfetto targeted mutagenesis in yeast with oligonucleotides.Genet. Eng. (N. Y.). 2003; 25: 189-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The mechanism of ssODN incorporation in eukaryotic cells is not precisely defined and may involve several factors, which include direction of DNA replication, cell-cycle phase, transcription, DNA mismatch repair (MMR), and HR (Rivera-Torres and Kmiec, 2016Rivera-Torres N. Kmiec E.B. Genetic spell-checking: gene editing using single-stranded DNA oligonucleotides.Plant Biotechnol. J. 2016; 14: 463-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Efforts to develop an analogous MAGE technology in S. cerevisiae have focused on overexpression of HR factors Rad51 and Rad54 in MMR deficient strains and resulted in moderately enhanced allelic replacement frequencies (ARFs) (∼0.1%–2%) (DiCarlo et al., 2013DiCarlo J.E. Conley A.J. Penttilä M. Jäntti J. Wang H.H. Church G.M. Yeast oligo-mediated genome engineering (YOGE).ACS Synth. Biol. 2013; 2: 741-749Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Thus, no method has been established in eukaryotes for precise, multisite genome modification with ssODNs at efficiencies attained in E. coli. Here, we describe eukaryotic MAGE (eMAGE) for the generation of precise combinatorial genome modifications of the model eukaryote and industrial chassis organism S. cerevisiae. This approach is rooted in biasing the annealing of synthetic ssODNs during DNA replication rather than a Rad51-directed strand-invasion mechanism. We observe single-bp precision gene editing with efficiencies >40%. Since eMAGE does not rely on DSBs, the process is highly scalable across a genomic region of interest and can simultaneously generate many precise and diverse modifications of a chromosome. We demonstrate that combinatorial genomic diversity can be generated across a population of cells in a single transformation, genomic landscapes can be traversed through successive iterations of this process, and multiple distal genetic changes can be parallelized and combined through strain mating to sample new phenotypes. Recombinase proteins (e.g., Rad51) catalyze the pairing and exchange of homologous DNA sequences. In S. cerevisiae, additional factors (e.g., Rad52, Rad54, Rad55, Rad57, and Rad59) participate in HR by promoting the formation of Rad51-ssDNA filaments or through annealing of ssDNA (San Filippo et al., 2008San Filippo J. Sung P. Klein H. Mechanism of eukaryotic homologous recombination.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2008; 77: 229-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (1165) Google Scholar). Prior work proposed that ssODNs are incorporated in the yeast genome through Rad51-mediated HR (Figure 1A) (DiCarlo et al., 2013DiCarlo J.E. Conley A.J. Penttilä M. Jäntti J. Wang H.H. Church G.M. Yeast oligo-mediated genome engineering (YOGE).ACS Synth. Biol. 2013; 2: 741-749Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, Liu et al., 2004Liu L. Maguire K.K. Kmiec E.B. Genetic re-engineering of Saccharomyces cerevisiae RAD51 leads to a significant increase in the frequency of gene repair in vivo.Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: 2093-2101Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Along these lines, we tried to enhance ssODN-mediated recombination by increasing expression of HR genes and impairing MMR. We measured ARF for an ssODN containing a single bp mutation in the RPL28 gene, which confers cycloheximide resistance, for a panel of HR genes and MMR knockout (KO) strains (Figures 1B, S1A, and S1B). Overexpression of the three HR factors Rad51, Rad52, and Rad59 increased ARF at least 10-fold above the negative control, with Rad51 and Rad52 producing the highest ARF (0.02%), followed by Rad59 (0.01%). Ablation of MMR led to ∼100-fold enhancement (0.1%) in the strain msh2Δ. Next, we combined HR overexpression with MMR KO strains (Figures 1B and S1C–S1F). Overexpression of Rad51 in msh2Δ, msh6Δ, and mlh1Δ strains increased ARF 4-fold above the level of the msh2Δ strain alone, yielding a maximum ARF of 0.4% that is consistent with prior work (DiCarlo et al., 2013DiCarlo J.E.

Together, these data suggest that ssODN incorporation by promoting Rad51-dependent HR and disabling MMR may be limited to the ARF previously reported.Figure S1Enhancement of ssODN Incorporation Efficiencies (ARF) through Constitutive Expression of HR Genes and Knockout of MMR, related to Figure 1Show full caption(A–F) Measurement of RPL28 ARF with overexpression of HR genes from pTEF1 promoter with a CEN/ARS plasmid in BY4741 (WT) strain (A), mismatch repair (MMR) mutant strains (B), and combinations of pTEF1-HR gene overexpression with four MMR mutant strain backgrounds (C-F).(G) Schematic illustrating co-transformation of two ssODNs targeted to loci on separate chromosomes to determine if the high ARFs (> 10%) observed for Ori-URA3-ADE2 require targeting within a contiguous chromosome.

The strand targeting efficiency (ARF %) trends are equivalent to those observed at the ARS1516 locus. Origin of replication indicated by double arrow. Strain is EMB259. (n = 3 for all data points). We hypothesized that Rad51-dependent ssODN recombination and incorporation of ssODNs at the DNA replication fork are two distinct pathways in eukaryotes (Figure 1A). Sherman and colleagues observed high frequencies of co-transformation for two ssODNs targeted within a cyc1 mutant gene when one of the ssODNs included a selectable mutation (Yamamoto et al., 1992Yamamoto T. Moerschell R.P. Wakem L.P. Ferguson D. Sherman F. Parameters affecting the frequencies of transformation and co-transformation with synthetic oligonucleotides in yeast.Yeast. 1992; 8: 935-948Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), which suggests that the two ssODNs were incorporated at the same DNA replication fork, and a finding also observed in E. coli (Carr et al., 2012Carr P.A. Wang H.H. Sterling B. Isaacs F.J. Lajoie M.J. Xu G. Church G.M. Jacobson J.M. Enhanced multiplex genome engineering through co-operative oligonucleotide co-selection.Nucleic Acids Res. 2012; 40: e132Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). To test ssODN gene editing at the replication fork, we constructed an experimental locus on chromosome 15 with a defined DNA replication direction by placing URA3 proximal to the origin of replication ARS1516 (Ori) directly adjacent to ADE2, which confers a colorimetric phenotype (wild-type [WT], white; mutant, red) (Figure 1C). We transformed cells with ssODNs targeting the predicted lagging strand of both URA3 and ADE2 and assayed the frequency of ade2 colony-forming units (CFUs). We did not detect ade2 CFUs for the WT strain (limit of detection [LOD] = 10−4 CFU), and we observed ∼0.1% ade2 CFUs for msh2Δ (Figure 1D). After 5-FOA selection to enrich for a competent subpopulation in ura3 clones, we observed 22% and 27% of CFUs with ssODN-derived ade2 mutations for WT and msh2Δ, respectively. To determine if the ARF enhancement is due to a coupled replication fork annealing mechanism we tested a marker-target pair (RPL28-ADE2) separated on different chromosomes (Figures S1G and S1H). After selection for rpl28 mutants, we recovered ade2 mutants in only 0.4% of CFUs, and overexpression of Rad51 led to a ∼100% increase (0.8%). Thus, ssODN incorporation is enhanced in ura3-edited competent cells where downstream modifications are kinetically favored along a DNA replication fork in a localized chromosomal region. To assess the impact of HR factors on the proposed replication fork annealing mechanism, we created a set of KO and overexpression strains for HR genes and assayed ssODN incorporation at the Ori-URA3-ADE2 locus. Unlike the RPL28-ADE2 interchromosomal pair, overexpression of Rad51 decreased ARF from ∼22% to ∼5%, whereas deletion of Rad51 increased ARF to ∼30% (Figure 1E). Application of the Rad51 inhibitor RI-1 also enhanced ARF (Figure S1I). Overexpression of the SSAP Rad52 increased ARF to ∼29%, whereas deletion of Rad52 showed a neutral effect. Overexpression of the SSAP Rad59 decreased ARF to ∼16%, whereas we did not observe ade2 mutants in rad59Δ (LOD = 10−3 CFU). The effect of rad59Δ was epistatic to rad52Δ (rad52Δrad59Δ). We observed varying degrees of suppression of rad59Δ and rad52Δrad59Δ with overexpression of Rad51, Rad52, Rad59, or λ Red Beta. Since loss of Rad52 impairs Rad51-dependent HR (Sung, 1997Sung P. Function of yeast Rad52 protein as a mediator between replication protein A and the Rad51 recombinase.J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28194-28197Crossref PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar), we observed a higher ARF with Rad51 overexpression in rad59Δ (4.6%) than rad52Δ (0.6%) or rad52Δrad59Δ (1.5%). Overexpression of Rad52 showed an equivalent ARF in all three strains (∼10%). The effect of Rad59 overexpression was enhanced in rad51Δ, rad52Δ, and rad52Δrad59Δ, potentially because of reduced competition from Rad51-dependent HR in these strains. Notably, λ Red Beta enhanced ARF to ∼29% in WT and recovered rad59Δ and rad52Δrad59Δ to ∼13%. In summary, our data show that ssODN annealing at the replication fork is distinct from Rad51-mediated ssODN recombination, enhanced in the rad51Δ background, and requires an SSAP (e.g., Rad59, Beta). To further study ssODN annealing at the replication fork, we tested the effect of leading (lead) versus lagging (lag) strand targeting. Since yeast chromosomes contain multiple origins of replication that fire at varying efficiencies (Friedman et al., 1997Friedman K.L. Brewer B.J. Fangman W.L. Replication profile of Saccharomyces cerevisiae chromosome VI.Genes Cells. 1997; 2: 667-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar), we placed URA3 in two orientations with respect to ADE2 (Figure 1F). In case 1, URA3 and ADE2 reside on the same side of the Ori, such that they are replicated in the same replication fork. In case 2, URA3 and ADE2 are positioned on different sides of the Ori, such that they are replicated in opposing directions when the Ori fires. We tested all lead/lag strand combinations in a set of WT (BY4741) and MMR mutant strains (msh2Δ, msh6Δ, mlh1Δ, and pms1Δ). The WT and msh2Δ strains had the highest ARF; however, the number of 5-FOA-resistant CFUs was ∼100-fold higher for msh2Δ compared to WT (see Figure 1B). In addition to selection for competent cells (Figure 1D), we observed two key factors that enhance ARF: (1) ssODNs that target the lag strand and (2) ssODN pairs that target the same chromosomal strand. The lag strand is favorable because of the prevalence of available ssDNA compared to the lead strand (Rivera-Torres and Kmiec, 2016Rivera-Torres N. Kmiec E.B. Genetic spell-checking: gene editing using single-stranded DNA oligonucleotides.Plant Biotechnol. J. 2016; 14: 463-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar) and pairs of ssODNs that target the same chromosomal strand result in cosegregation of the ssODN-derived alleles. Consistent with this model, the lag-lag (ura3-ade2) strand combination for case 1 (case 1b) satisfies both criteria and showed the highest ARF in all strains except msh6Δ, which was enhanced in case 2. Such differences in ARF could be due to MMR activity at the replisome or altered replisome dynamics and warrants investigation in future work. Cases 1c (lead-lead), 2a (lag-lead), and 2d (lead-lag) satisfy condition 2 and showed elevated ARF. Since the Ori does not always fire, the enhanced ARF for cases 2a and 2d could be explained by replication from adjacent origins in some cells rendering the ssODNs in the same replication fork. Four scenarios (cases 1a, 1d, 2b, and 2c) should not result in cosegregation of the ura3 and ade2 alleles, yet we observed clones with both ssODN-derived alleles. This suggests that either the ssODNs can persist for more than a single cell cycle or rapid processing of the heteroduplex by MMR or a MMR-independent pathway followed by HR between sister chromatids might explain the cosegregation (San Filippo et al., 2008San Filippo J. Sung P. Klein H. Mechanism of eukaryotic homologous recombination.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2008; 77: 229-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (1165) Google Scholar). For these scenarios, higher ARFs occur when the ade2 ssODN is targeted to the lag strand. To validate our findings, we observed equivalent strand bias trends for msh2Δ in both case 1 and case 2 for a distal locus (RPL28) on chromosome 7 (Figure S1J). Thus, efficient ssODN incorporation (>10%) can be achieved for marker-target pairs adjacent to or on opposite sides of an Ori through precise targeting at the replication fork. We conducted three key experiments to investigate the impact of replication dynamics and factors that monitor replication and repair. First, we tested if slowing DNA replication with hydroxyurea (HU) enhances ssODN incorporation. A 30-min treatment with 500 mM HU increased the ARF by ∼2-fold with no significant increase in spontaneous ura3 mutations (Figures S2A and S2B). HU also enhanced ARF by an average of 56% for seven ssODNs containing a single bp mismatch (ssODNs 1, 2, and 5–7), insertion (ssODN 4), or deletion (ssODN 3) in ADE2 (Figure 2A). To validate these data and disconnect the selection step from dNTP metabolism, we observed similar findings with HIS3 selection (Figure S2C). Next, to determine if annealing of the ura3 ssODN induces a DNA damage response that enhances downstream ssODN annealing, we exposed cells to a range of UV irradiation, a general DNA damage event, and did not observe an ARF increase (Figure S2D). Third, replication slowing has been implicated to occur during gene editing (Rivera-Torres and Kmiec, 2016Rivera-Torres N. Kmiec E.B. Genetic spell-checking: gene editing using single-stranded DNA oligonucleotides.Plant Biotechnol. J. 2016; 14: 463-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar), and we postulated that ssODN annealing might stall the replication fork to enhance ARFs at downstream loci. Since Mec1-dependent signaling is associated with stalled replication forks (Branzei and Foiani, 2010Branzei D. Foiani M. Maintaining genome stability at the replication fork.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2010; 11: 208-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (608) Google Scholar), we tested the effect of deleting Mec1 (Figure 2B). Given that null mutants of Mec1 are viable in sml1Δ strains, we measured ARF in sml1Δ and sml1Δmec1Δ. ARF was reduced by ∼25% in sml1Δ and by ∼60% in sml1Δmec1Δ for both ± HU conditions. In summary, slowing replication fork speed with HU increases ARF; ARF enhancement is independent of UV-induced DNA damage; and Mec1 deletion attenuates ARF.Figure 2Investigating Replication Dynamics for Incorporation of Diverse Mutations with ssODNsShow full caption(A) The effect of hydroxyurea (HU) treatment (red) on seven ssODNs each containing a single bp change.(B) Effect of Mec1 deletion ± HU.(C) Optimization of ssODN concentration and size for ura3 + ade2 ssODNs.

https://openalex.org/W2769873734,"Human cancers are known to downregulate Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) class I expression thereby escaping recognition and rejection by anti-tumor T cells. Here we report that oxygen tension in the tumor microenvironment (TME) serves as an extrinsic cue that regulates antigen presentation by MHC class I molecules. In support of this view, hypoxia is shown to negatively regulate MHC expression in a HIF-dependent manner as evidenced by (i) lower MHC expression in the hypoxic TME in vivo and in hypoxic 3-dimensional (3D) but not 2-dimensional (2D) tumor cell cultures in vitro; (ii) decreased MHC in human renal cell carcinomas with constitutive expression of HIF due to genetic loss of von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) function as compared with isogenically paired cells with restored VHL function, and iii) increased MHC in tumor cells with siRNA-mediated knockdown of HIF. In addition, hypoxia downregulated antigen presenting proteins like TAP 1/2 and LMP7 that are known to have a dominant role in surface display of peptide-MHC complexes. Corroborating oxygen-dependent regulation of MHC antigen presentation, hyperoxia (60% oxygen) transcriptionally upregulated MHC expression and increased levels of TAP2, LMP2 and 7. In conclusion, this study reveals a novel mechanism by which intra-tumoral hypoxia and HIF can potentiate immune escape. It also suggests the use of hyperoxia to improve tumor cell-based cancer vaccines and for mining novel immune epitopes. Furthermore, this study highlights the advantage of 3D cell cultures in reproducing hypoxia-dependent changes observed in the TME."
https://openalex.org/W2769415561,"Caesarean section (C-section) is a major obstetric intervention for saving lives of women and their newborns from pregnancy and childbirth related complications. Un-necessary C-sections may have adverse impact upon maternal and neonatal outcomes. In Bangladesh there is paucity of data on clinical indication of C-section at population level. We conducted a retrospective study in icddr,b Health and Demographic Surveillance System (HDSS) area of Matlab to look into the indications and determinants of C-sections. All resident women in HDSS service area who gave birth in 2013 with a known birth outcome, were included in the study. Women who underwent C-section were identified from birth and pregnancy files of HDSS and their indication for C-section were collected reviewing health facility records where the procedure took place, supplemented by face-to-face interview of mothers where data were missing. Indications of C-section were presented as frequency distribution and further divided into different groups following 3 distinct classification systems. Socio-demographic predictors were explored following statistical method of binary logistic regression.During 2013, facility delivery rate was 84% and population based C-section rate was 35% of all deliveries in icddr,b service area. Of all C-sections, only 1.4% was conducted for Absolute Maternal Indications (AMIs). Major indications of C-sections included: repeat C-section (24%), foetal distress (21%), prolonged labour (16%), oligohydramnios (14%) and post-maturity (13%). More than 80% C-sections were performed in for-profit private facilities. Probability of C-section delivery increased with improved socio-economic status, higher education, lower birth order, higher age, and with more number of Antenatal Care use and presence of bad obstetric history. Eight maternal deaths occurred, of which five were delivered by C-section.C-section rate in this area was much higher than national average as well as global recommendations. Very few of C-sections were undertaken for AMIs. Routine monitoring of clinical indication of C-section in public and private facilities is needed to ensure rational use of the procedure."

https://openalex.org/W2770469636,"High-grade gliomas (HGGs) include the most common and the most aggressive primary brain tumor of adults and children. Despite multimodality treatment, most high-grade gliomas eventually recur and are ultimately incurable. Several studies suggest that the initiation, progression, and recurrence of gliomas are driven, at least partly, by cancer stem-like cells. A defining characteristic of these cancer stem-like cells is their capacity to self-renew. We have identified a hypoxia-induced pathway that utilizes the Hypoxia Inducible Factor 1α (HIF-1α) transcription factor and the JAK1/2-STAT3 (Janus Kinase 1/2 - Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription 3) axis to enhance the self-renewal of glioma stem-like cells. Hypoxia is a commonly found pathologic feature of HGGs. Under hypoxic conditions, HIF-1α levels are greatly increased in glioma stem-like cells. Increased HIF-1α activates the JAK1/2-STAT3 axis and enhances tumor stem-like cell self-renewal. Our data further demonstrate the importance of Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF) secretion for this pathway of hypoxia-mediated self-renewal. Brefeldin A and EHT-1864, agents that significantly inhibit VEGF secretion, decreased stem cell self-renewal, inhibited tumor growth, and increased the survival of mice allografted with S100β-v-erbB/p53−/− glioma stem-like cells. These agents also inhibit the expression of a hypoxia gene expression signature that is associated with decreased survival of HGG patients. These findings suggest that targeting the secretion of extracellular, autocrine/paracrine mediators of glioma stem-like cell self-renewal could potentially contribute to the treatment of HGGs."

Therefore, Sema3F-Npn-2/PlexA3 signaling controls both synapse development and synaptic plasticity.

We show that the secreted guidance cue semaphorin 3F (Sema3F) and its neuropilin-2 (Npn-2)/plexinA3 (PlexA3) holoreceptor mediate homeostatic plasticity in cortical neurons.

Therefore, Sema3F-Npn-2/PlexA3 signaling controls both synapse development and synaptic plasticity. Hebbian plasticity mechanisms, including long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term depression (LTD), underlie many forms of learning and memory. If unchecked, LTP and LTD can disrupt neuronal network function (Abbott and Nelson, 2000Abbott L.F. Nelson S.B. Synaptic plasticity: taming the beast.Nat. Neurosci. 2000; 3: 1178-1183Crossref PubMed Scopus (1469) Google Scholar, Miller and Mackay, 1994Miller K.D. Mackay D.J.C. The role of constraints in hebbian learning.Neural Comput. 1994; 6: 100-126Crossref Google Scholar); however, homeostatic plasticity mechanisms allow neural circuits to cope with these destabilizing forces. In the central nervous system (CNS), neurons can maintain their firing rates through homeostatic scaling (Turrigiano, 2012Turrigiano G. Homeostatic synaptic plasticity: local and global mechanisms for stabilizing neuronal function.Cold Spring Harb. Perspect. Biol. 2012; 4: a005736Crossref PubMed Scopus (645) Google Scholar). Homeostatic scaling was initially characterized in cultured neurons by the observation that long-term pharmacological disruption of neuronal activity leads to bidirectional adjustment of synaptic strength (O’Brien et al., 1998O’Brien R.J. Kamboj S. Ehlers M.D. Rosen K.R. Fischbach G.D. Huganir R.L.

Homeostatic scaling can change synaptic strength globally in a given neuron, or locally at individual synapses, maintaining the relative weight of different synaptic inputs and allowing neurons to maintain balanced, optimized firing rates while preserving the relative strengths of synaptic connections (Turrigiano, 2012Turrigiano G. Homeostatic synaptic plasticity: local and global mechanisms for stabilizing neuronal function.Cold Spring Harb. Perspect. Biol. 2012; 4: a005736Crossref PubMed Scopus (645) Google Scholar). Blocking neuronal activity in vitro using tetrodotoxin (TTX) leads to increased synaptic strength, or upscaling, whereas elevating neuronal activity with bicuculline leads to decreased synaptic strength, or downscaling. Synaptic scaling is also observed in vivo (Desai et al., 2002Desai N.S. Cudmore R.H. Nelson S.B. Turrigiano G.G. Critical periods for experience-dependent synaptic scaling in visual cortex.Nat.

A wide range of intracellular and extracellular molecules and signaling pathways regulate homeostatic scaling. For example, brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is important for homeostatic upscaling; BDNF depletion resembles TTX-induced mEPSC amplitude upscaling. Additional factors that mediate upscaling include tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα), the C-kinase 1-interacting protein PICK1 and the glutamate receptor interacting protein GRIP1, and the immediate early gene Arc (Gainey et al., 2015Gainey M.A. Tatavarty V.

It remains to be determined whether any of these CUB domain proteins are themselves regulated by extracellular signals. Semaphorin proteins (Semas) were initially characterized as repulsive and attractive neuronal guidance cues during neural development (Tran et al., 2007Tran T.S. Kolodkin A.L. Bharadwaj R. Semaphorin regulation of cellular morphology.Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2007; 23: 263-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). Plexins, a large family of conserved transmembrane receptors, are the major signaling receptors that mediate Sema functions (Pasterkamp, 2012Pasterkamp R.J. Getting neural circuits into shape with semaphorins.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2012; 13: 605-618Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). Most vertebrate-secreted Semas do not bind directly to plexins; instead, they associate with a neuropilin (Npn) co-receptor, a transmembrane protein that together with an A class plexin receptor constitute secreted Sema holoreceptors. For example, during neural development the secreted semaphorin Sema3F signals repulsive guidance events critical for axon patterning through a holoreceptor complex comprised of Npn-2 and PlexA3 (Tran et al., 2007Tran T.S. Kolodkin A.L. Bharadwaj R. Semaphorin regulation of cellular morphology.Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2007; 23: 263-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). Semaphorins also function later in mammalian neural development to regulate the elaboration of dendritic morphology, excitatory and inhibitory synaptogenesis, and synapse function (Koropouli and Kolodkin, 2014Koropouli E. Kolodkin A.L. Semaphorins and the dynamic regulation of synapse assembly, refinement, and function.Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2014; 27: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Sema3F constrains dendritic spine number on apical dendrites of cortical pyramidal neurons and also regulates excitatory synapse formation and function in these same neurons. Further, Sema3F modulates synaptic transmission in hippocampal dentate granule and CA1 neurons, and the Sema3F co-receptor Npn-2 is enriched in postsynaptic density (PSD) fractions from adult mouse forebrain. Additionally, the related secreted semaphorin Sema3A modulates excitatory synaptic transmission in hippocampal neurons in vitro, class 5 transmembrane Semas negatively regulate dendritic spine development and synaptogenesis in hippocampal dentate granule cells, and class 4 Semas influence both inhibitory and excitatory synaptogenesis (Koropouli and Kolodkin, 2014Koropouli E.

Here, we investigate the role of Sema signaling in homeostatic synaptic plasticity, focusing on the regulation of cell surface glutamate receptor levels following changes in neural activity. We find that Sema3F and its Npn-2/PlexA3 receptor complex are required for activity-dependent modulation of cell surface AMPAR levels, revealing a novel role for secreted semaphorins and their receptors in homeostatic synaptic plasticity in response to changes in neural activity. To address how classical guidance cues influence neural plasticity, we sought to refine our understanding of Sema3F function at mature synapses. To better define Sema3F expression in the adult nervous system, we generated an N-terminally tagged Sema3F knockin mouse (MycSema3F) in which a 6xMyc epitope coding sequence was inserted in the endogenous Sema3F locus downstream of the Sema3F signal sequence (Figure S1). MycSema3F homozygous mice show none of the neural developmental phenotypes associated with Sema3F null mutants (data not shown). A Myc antibody was used for western blot analysis to detect MycSema3F in neocortical brain lysates derived from Myc/MycSema3F mice at various developmental stages, from embryonic day 14.5 (E14.5) to postnatal day 42 (P42). We observed one major band at the predicted molecular weight of Sema3F, along with several minor bands that are most likely the result of proteolytic processing (Adams et al., 1997Adams R.H. Lohrum M. Klostermann A. Betz H. Püschel A.W. The chemorepulsive activity of secreted semaphorins is regulated by furin-dependent proteolytic processing.EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6077-6086Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar) (Figure 1A). MycSema3F protein expression is highest in the embryonic and early postnatal neocortex, gradually declining after birth but remaining expressed in the adult neocortex, like its Npn-2 receptor (Figure 1A). We next performed immunohistochemistry on sections obtained from adult Myc/MycSema3F mice, staining with a Myc antibody and co-staining with antibodies directed against Ctip2 (a deep layer cortical neuron marker; Arlotta et al., 2005Arlotta P. Molyneaux B.J. Chen J. Inoue J. Kominami R. Macklis J.D.

McGuinness T. Greengard P. A calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase from mammalian brain that phosphorylates Synapsin I: partial purification and characterization.J. Neurosci. 1983; 3: 818-831Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). 94% of Ctip2+ cells, and 96% of CaMKII+ cells, located in somatosensory cortex also exhibit cytosolic Myc immunoreactivity (Figure 1B). In addition, cortical cultures derived from Myc/MycSema3F mice co-stained with anti-Myc and either anti-CaMKII or anti-GAD (Glutamate decarboxylase) revealed MycSema3F expression in CaMKII+ cells, but little expression of MycSema3F in GAD+ cells (Figure S1F). These results suggest that Sema3F is expressed in excitatory adult cortical pyramidal neurons and may influence their function. Since Sema3F modulates excitatory synaptic transmission and regulates dendritic morphology, we asked whether secretion of Sema3F is regulated by neuronal activity. We treated cultured MycSema3F cortical neurons at 14 days in vitro (DIV) with bicuculline or TTX to either raise or lower global neuronal network activity. To detect Sema3F secretion from MycSema3F cortical neurons in culture, we subjected culture supernatants to immunoprecipitation with a Myc antibody and assessed MycSema3F by western analysis. We found that bicuculline treatment for 48 hr results in significantly increased levels of MycSema3F protein in the culture medium (Figures 1C and 1D). However, TTX treatment does not result in alteration of MycSema3F levels in neuronal culture supernatants. The overall levels of MycSema3F protein in lysates derived from these same cultured cortical neurons do not significantly change following these treatments (Figure 1C), suggesting that changes in neuronal activity do not grossly change overall Sema3F expression levels. We also used an alkaline phosphatase (AP)-conjugated Npn-2 extracellular domain (AP-Npn-2Ecto) to detect Sema3F protein in wild-type cortical neuron culture supernatants following treatment with bicuculline or TTX for 48 hr since AP-Npn-2Ecto robustly labels endogenous Sema3F in the wild-type, but not Sema3F−/−, neocortex (Tran et al., 2009Tran T.S. Rubio M.E. Clem R.L. Johnson D. Case L. Tessier-Lavigne M. Huganir R.L. Ginty D.D. Kolodkin A.L. Secreted semaphorins control spine distribution and morphogenesis in the postnatal CNS.Nature. 2009; 462: 1065-1069Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). We observed a significant increase in AP-Npn-2Ecto binding following bicuculline treatment, but not TTX treatment (Figures 1E and 1F), similar to our observations of MycSema3F protein levels in MycSema3F neuronal cultures. To address the possibility that bicuculline non-specifically increases global neuronal secretion, we used an AP-conjugated Npn-1 extracellular domain (AP-Npn-1Ecto) to detect the secreted semaphorin Sema3A and observed Sema3A expression in cortical neuron culture medium (Figures 1E and 1F). However, neither bicuculline nor TTX altered Sema3A levels. These results suggest that increased neuronal activity selectively promotes Sema3F secretion. The regulation of Sema3F secretion by prolonged changes in neuronal activity raises the possibility that Sema3F participates in activity-induced synaptic plasticity. To investigate the role of Sema3F signaling in homeostatic scaling, we first compared GluA1 cell surface expression levels in Sema3F−/− and wild-type cultured cortical neurons. Cell surface proteins were biotinylated and GluA1 was detected by western blot analysis, in addition to live staining, to assess cell surface GluA1 levels (neurons were cultured from E14.5 mouse cortices for 14 DIV). We did not observe significant differences in cell surface GluA1 levels between wild-type and Sema3F−/− cultures (Figures 2A and 2C ). We next examined GluA1 cell surface levels following treatment with either bicuculline or TTX for 48 hr, which induces either down- or upscaling, respectively, that is reflected by changes in cell surface AMPA receptor expression (O’Brien et al., 1998O’Brien R.J. Kamboj S. Ehlers M.D. Rosen K.R. Fischbach G.D. Huganir R.L.

Treatment with bicuculline results in a reduction in cell surface GluA1 in wild-type cortical neurons, here detected by an antibody against the extracellular region of GluA1 in living cultures (Figures 2A and 2B) and also by cell surface biotinylation and subsequent western analysis (Figures 2C and 2D). However, bicuculline treatment of Sema3F−/− cortical cultures does not result in a significant change in cell surface GluA1 expression (Figures 2A–2D). Upon TTX or bicuculline treatment, previous studies report changes in surface AMPAR abundance that include both GluA1 and GluA2 AMPAR subunits (Cingolani et al., 2008Cingolani L.A. Thalhammer A.

We investigated cell surface GluA2 scaling in wild-type and Sema3F−/− cultures and observed results similar to GluA1 (Figures 2C and 2D). Importantly, TTX treatment results in an increase in cell surface GluA1 both in wild-type and Sema3F−/− cortical cultures, showing that Sema3F is required for bicuculline-induced downscaling but not TTX-induced upscaling of cell surface AMPA receptors. To assess direct effects of Sema3F on cell surface GluA1 levels, we treated cultured cortical neurons with Sema3F for various times and measured GluA1 cell surface expression. Treatment with Sema3F for 48 hr leads to a significant reduction in neuronal cell surface GluA1 levels (Figures 2E and 2F), and when cultured neurons were treated with both bicuculline and Sema3F together no further reduction in cell surface GluA1 was observed beyond that resulting from treatment with bicuculline alone (Figures 2G and 2H). These results suggest that Sema3F and bicuculline act in the same AMPAR cell surface downscaling signaling pathway. Neuropilin-2 (Npn-2), an obligate co-receptor component of the Sema3F holoreceptor, is expressed in the murine adult brain and is also enriched in PSD fractions (Sahay et al., 2005Sahay A. Kim C.H. Sepkuty J.P. Cho E. Huganir R.L. Ginty D.D. Kolodkin A.L. Secreted semaphorins modulate synaptic transmission in the adult hippocampus.J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 3613-3620Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). To further investigate Npn-2 subcellular localization, we generated an N-terminally hemagglutinin (HA)-tagged Npn-2 knockin mouse (HANpn-2) in which a 2xHA epitope coding sequence was inserted in the endogenous Npn-2 locus downstream of the Npn-2 signal sequence (Figure S2A and STAR Methods). Using an HA antibody for western blot analysis, we detected a signal at a molecular weight similar to wild-type Npn-2 protein in brain lysates derived from HANpn-2 mice (Figure S2B). Importantly, we did not observe any of the deficits previously associated with Npn2 null mutants (Tran et al., 2007Tran T.S. Kolodkin A.L. Bharadwaj R. Semaphorin regulation of cellular morphology.Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2007; 23: 263-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar) in HANpn-2 mice (data not shown), suggesting that HANpn-2 is expressed normally in these HANpn-2 mice. HANpn-2-derived cortical neuron cultures were transfected with a plasmid encoding green fluorescent protein (GFP), and using an HA antibody, we detected HANpn-2 protein at dendritic spines (∼72% of spines contain HA-Npn2 signal) (Figure 3A). A significant fraction of HANpn-2 puncta colocalizes with GluA1 puncta in cortical neuron cultures (Figure 3B: ∼68% GluA1 colocalization with HANpn-2, and ∼30% HANpn-2 colocalization with GluA1), and most vGlut1+ puncta (a presynaptic terminal marker for excitatory glutamatergic synapses) are juxtaposed to HANpn-2 puncta (Figure S2C). Wild-type neurons derived from littermate controls did not show HA antibody staining (Figure S2B). We next asked whether Npn-2 is required for activity-induced downscaling of cell surface AMPARs. We treated cortical cultures (14 DIV) derived from E14.5 Npn-2−/− or littermate control brains with bicuculline or TTX for 48 hr and assessed the effects of altering neuronal activity on levels of cell surface AMPARs. Bicuculline treatment reduces cell surface GluA1 levels in wild-type cortical cultures (Figures 3C–3F); however, it does not result in significant changes in cell surface GluA1 levels in Npn-2−/− cortical neurons (Figures 3C–3F). In contrast, TTX treatment for 48 hr results in increased GluA1 cell surface levels in both wild-type and Npn-2−/− cortical neurons. GluA2 scaling in wild-type and Npn2−/− cultures was similar to GluA1 (Figures 3E and 3F). Previously reported homeostatic synaptic scaling resulting from changes in neural activity is mostly reported from cortical cultures derived from older brains (Shepherd et al., 2006Shepherd J.D. Rumbaugh G. Wu J. Chowdhury S. Plath N. Kuhl D. Huganir R.L. Worley P.F.

E18 Npn-2−/− embryo-derived cortical cultures (Figures S2D and S2E) show a lack of bicuculline-induced GluA1 downscaling, similar to E14.5-derived cultures (Figures 3C–3F). These results show that Npn-2 is required for bicuculline-induced cell surface AMPAR downscaling. To assess the functional role played by Npn-2 in synaptic scaling, we recorded mEPSCs from neurons in wild-type or Npn-2−/− cortical cultures derived from E18 embryos. Consistent with previous reports (O’Brien et al., 1998O’Brien R.J. Kamboj S. Ehlers M.D. Rosen K.R. Fischbach G.D. Huganir R.L.

However, Npn-2−/− cortical neurons failed to exhibit a significant bicuculline-induced decrease in synaptic strength (Figures 4A and 4B). We did not observe significant differences between mEPSC frequency in bicuculline-treated wild-type or Npn-2−/− cortical neurons (Figure S3A). Further, no difference in resting membrane potential or cell capacitance was observed (Figures S3F and S3G), indicating similar intrinsic excitability and comparable cell size between groups. We next used PSD95 as a synaptic marker (Huganir and Nicoll, 2013Huganir R.L. Nicoll R.A. AMPARs and synaptic plasticity: the last 25 years.Neuron. 2013; 80: 704-717Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (648) Google Scholar) to specifically monitor cell surface distribution of postsynaptic GluA1 and found that the reduction in synaptic GluA1 by bicuculline is abolished in E18 Npn-2−/− cortical cultures (Figures 4C and 4D). We also assessed the acute effect of Sema3F on mEPSC frequency and amplitude. In line with our biochemical assessment of GluA1 cell surface level changes upon Sema3F treatment (Figures 2E and 2F), we found that after 4 hr of Sema3F treatment, cultured wild-type or Npn2−/− cortical neurons showed no significant differences in mEPSC amplitude or frequency (Figures S3H and S3I). These observations are consistent with previous assessments of changes in AMPAR cell surface expression during homeostatic scaling (O’Brien et al., 1998O’Brien R.J. Kamboj S. Ehlers M.D. Rosen K.R.

A fundamental question in cognitive neuroscience is how choices between biologically relevant goods are made, particularly when those goods do not share common features. Put simply, how does the brain choose between, for example, apples and oranges? One influential account from economics that has gained significant traction is that the brain reduces the complex feature space of goods to a single dimension of value so that different goods can be compared on a universal scale (Levy and Glimcher, 2012Levy D.J.

In this framework, the values of all available options are computed and then compared in real time to maximize the gains of the economic decision-maker based on his or her current needs or wants. Research has implicated the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) as the nexus of this value computation by showing that neural activity within the OFC correlates with the common currency value both of available and chosen goods during economic decision-making (Levy and Glimcher, 2011Levy D.J.

Yet, to date, no studies have established a significant causal role for this neural activity in these complex behaviors. Here we test this question. We duplicated, in rats, the economic choice task used in monkeys to isolate key neural correlates of economic value in the OFC (Padoa-Schioppa and Assad, 2006Padoa-Schioppa C. Assad J.A.

Once the rats learned the task procedures, we used optogenetics to transiently inactivate the OFC during randomly selected trials within some sessions. This approach revealed no effects of OFC inactivation on the rats’ choice behavior. In contrast, optogenetic inactivation of the OFC in the same cohort of rats prevented the normal changes in conditioned responding after reinforcer devaluation, a function known to be OFC dependent across species (Gallagher et al., 1999Gallagher M.

This dissociation provides direct evidence that the region of the OFC that is necessary for behavior reflecting current wants is not necessary for economic decision-making. To determine whether the OFC is necessary for economic choice behavior, we developed an economic choice task for rats duplicating the now-iconic procedures established to test economic decision-making in monkeys (Padoa-Schioppa and Assad, 2006Padoa-Schioppa C. Assad J.A. Neurons in the orbitofrontal cortex encode economic value.Nature. 2006; 441: 223-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (1072) Google Scholar). To accomplish this, rats were trained to use a pair of 3.5” touchscreens, oriented in front of a centrally located nosepoke port, to choose between different amounts (1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and sometimes 8) of two differently flavored food pellets (banana, bacon, grain, chocolate, grape, or cellulose). The flavors and amounts of each pellet per offer on a given trial were represented by symbols on the touchscreens, with shape signaling pellet flavor and segmentation signaling pellet number (Figures 1A and S1). Offers were counterbalanced by side and chosen randomly from a pre-established set. The visual cues were revealed following a 1 s nosepoke at the port in front of the screens, after which the rat could make a choice by touching the screen displaying the preferred option. The selected flavor and amount was then delivered to a single food port located on the opposite wall of the training chamber (see Movie S1). The experiment used 6 different cues to represent 6 differently flavored pellets, which were arranged in 10 types of sessions pitting individual pellets against one another. After initial training on the apparatus and familiarization with the cue-pellet pairings, the rats exhibited clear subjective preferences among the pellets. Importantly, these preferences were influenced not only by the quantity but also by the flavor of the pellets available. Further, their subjective preferences between the different pellets were stable across days. These features can be illustrated by examining behavior over consecutive days on which the rats received offers involving three different pellets (Figure 1B; for additional examples, see Figure S2). The choice behavior on each of the 3 days was fit with a sigmoid to estimate an indifference point for each pair of pellets. The indifference point was then used as a method to infer the relative value of the two pellets. This indifference point was often greater than 1:1, even approaching 4:1 for chocolate versus grain (Figure 1B, lower left), indicating that the rats were sometimes willing to accept fewer pellets in order to obtain a particular flavor. Additionally, the indifference point for one pair of pellets could be predicted from the indifference points for the other two pairs in the triplet (Figure 1C). Thus, the rats’ preferences among the pellets showed the so-called property of transitivity. Importantly, this was true even though testing was done on different days, revealing remarkable stability in the economic decision-making of the rats. In fact, none of the points (n = 54) were sufficiently removed from the identity line to violate transitivity (z test, p < 0.1; see STAR Methods); if the indifference points in a triplet are selected at random from the different pellet pairs (AB, BC, and AC), nearly 15% of the points violate transitivity, a result that is significantly different from our experimental result (binomial test, p < 0.01; see STAR Methods). Overall these data establish that these rats were engaged in economic decision-making as operationally defined by prior studies of similar choice behavior (Padoa-Schioppa, 2009Padoa-Schioppa C.

Indeed, these rats even exhibited a slight but significant slowing of reaction time around the indifference point (Figure 1D), which has previously been cited as evidence of active deliberation being required when differences in economic value or utility are small (Padoa-Schioppa et al., 2006Padoa-Schioppa C.

With a rat version of the economic choice task in hand, we next tried to evaluate the hypothesis that economic decision-making depends on value estimates generated in the OFC at the time of cue presentation and choice. While it is difficult to draw precise homologies across species, it has been claimed that economic value reflects value estimates that are devaluation sensitive or computed on the fly at the time of the decision (Padoa-Schioppa, 2011Padoa-Schioppa C.

Such value estimates would be termed model based in current parlance (Daw et al., 2005Daw N.D. Niv Y. Dayan P.

If this is true, economic decision-making should depend on the area of the OFC that has been shown to be necessary for other behaviors that are dependent on model-based value estimates. In rats and primates, this is the lateral OFC (Rudebeck and Murray, 2011aRudebeck P.H. Murray E.A.

Neurotoxic lesions and reversible inactivation of this area affect the ability both of rats and of monkeys to use the current value of a predicted reward to guide behavior (Gallagher et al., 1999Gallagher M.

We used an optogenetic approach to inactivate this region. Rats that had been trained to perform the task underwent surgery in which AAV-CaMKIIa-eNpHR3.0-eYFP (halo, n = 9) or AAV-CaMKIIa-eYFP (control, n = 7) was infused into the lateral OFC bilaterally, and fiberoptic probes were implanted overlying each injection site to allow light delivery (Figure 2B). After recovery, these rats were acclimated to the task while tethered to a patch cord. Once performance returned to pre-surgical levels, we began testing to determine whether inactivation of OFC would impact task performance. To test this question, we assessed the performance of each rat on three different pellet pairs across nine test sessions (Figure 2A). Each pair was presented once in an initial warm-up session, and then data were acquired in two sessions using either a blocked dummy cable or a patent light-transmitting cable, both of which were counterbalanced across days. The purpose of using a blocked cable was to provide a within-subjects control for possible effects of light dispersed from the cable/ferrule interface, a particularly important control in this case due to the subjective, and hence varying, nature of the indifference point measure. Finally, within each session, half the trials of each offer were randomly chosen as laser-on trials. On these trials, green light (16–18 mW, 532 nm) was delivered into the OFC by activating a laser connected to the fiberoptic probes overlying the OFC. The laser was activated at the onset of white noise indicating nosepoke availability and terminated in a 300-ms ramp when the rat made a choice by touching one of the screens, so that the OFC was inactivated during the entirety of the cue and choice periods. The remaining trials served as laser-off control trials. This arrangement resulted in a design with two within-subject factors (laser-on versus laser-off and blocked versus patent fiber) and one between-subject factor (eYFP versus halo). This allowed us to distinguish the effects on economic choice behavior due to real-time inactivation of neural activity in OFC from confounding effects of light delivery into the brain, light leakage into the training box, viral infection, or a combination of these factors. It was unclear to us how losing the ability to calculate economic value should degrade economic choice behavior. Would rats default to selecting only one of the two rewards? Would they always select the larger amount or adopt a strong side bias? Or would their performance be entirely random? Whatever the case, we expected dramatic effects. However, this is not what we observed. In fact, examination of the performance in representative example sessions revealed no apparent effect of inactivating the OFC (Figure 2C); while very small differences in the choice curves were present when the laser was on versus off in the halo subject, similar differences were also apparent in the eYFP control subject and the halo subject with blocked fiber. That these shifts are random noise and unrelated to inactivation of OFC is supported by the lack of any effect of laser on the average response curves for each condition (each session was aligned to the indifference point [Figure 2D] and by the lack of a significant effect on the indifference points for the different conditions [Figures 3 and 4]). Indeed, the two curves, laser-on and laser-off (Figure 2D), in each of the four conditions are highly overlapping and difficult to distinguish. A three-way mixed ANOVA with laser (on/off) and fiber (blocked/patent) as within-subject factors and virus (eYFP/halo) as a between-subject factor of these data revealed no significant main effects (blocked/unblocked fiber, F(1, 100) = 0.03, p = 0.85; laser on/laser off, F(1, 100) = 0.00, p = 0.95; eYFP/halo, F(1, 100) = 3.11, p = 0.081) nor any significant two-way (fiber∗laser, F(1,100) = 3.24, p = 0.074; fiber∗virus, F(1,100) = 0.60, p = 0.44; laser∗virus, F(1, 100) = 1.52, p = 0.22) or three-way (fiber∗laser∗virus, F(1, 100) = 0.01, p = 0.92) interactions. Indeed, the critical three-way interaction required to formally conclude that there was a specific effect of inactivation of OFC on indifference point would have required an n > 106 to reach significance at p = 0.05. Importantly, the negative results did not depend on the location of the preferred cue on offers when the OFC was inactivated (left and right trials run separately, p > 0.074 for all main effects and interactions; see STAR Methods for multiple comparison test).Figure 4No Effect of OFC Inactivation on the Inverse Slope (σ) for Individual SessionsShow full caption(A) The inverse slope (s, estimated sigma from probit regression) from 46 sessions from the eYFP group (n = 7, top) and 56 sessions from the Halo group (n = 9, bottom) are shown for the blocked and patent patch cable fibers (left/right), split by laser-on trials (colored histograms) and laser-off trials (gray histograms).(B) Scatterplot of the paired within-session differences between laser-on and laser-off trials for each session-type (blocked and patent fibers, x and y axis, respectively) bounded by corresponding histograms on each axis.(C) Boxplots of the inverse slope for each treatment corresponding to the histograms in (A).(D) The average difference in inverse slope for laser-on and -off trials calculated only using sessions with IPs greater than the IP threshold (x axis) for the Halo group (left) and the eYFP group (right).

For this analysis sessions close to 1:1 were progressively removed to up to 90% of the total sessions analyzed. Gray vertical lines in (D) show the IP threshold corresponding to a significant IP using a bootstrap method (see STAR Methods). To rule out the possibility that a shift of the choice curve toward a 1:1 indifference point might be masked by inclusion of sessions with indifference points close to 1:1 (sessions in which the pellets had similar values), we removed sessions close to 1:1 using an empirical distribution (40 sessions were dropped with a minimum threshold of 1.39:1; see STAR Methods) and re-ran the three-way ANOVA on data from the remaining sessions. This amounted to analyzing indifference points from sessions in which rats had a substantial subjective or economic preference for one of the two pellets. Despite this manipulation of the data, the results remained insignificant (Main Effects, Fiber: F(1,60) = 1.05, p = 0.31; Laser: F(1,60) = 0.02, p = 0.90; Virus: F(1,60) = 0.92, p = 0.34; Two way interactions, Fiber∗Laser: F(1,60) = 0.41, p = 0.53; Fiber∗Virus: F(1,60) = 0.02, p = 0.90; Laser∗Virus: F(1,60) = 1.71, p = 0.20; Three-way interaction, Fiber∗Laser∗Virus: F(1,60) = 0.23, p = 0.63). This lack of an effect of removing these sessions is visualized in Figure 3D, which shows the difference in indifference point on laser-on and laser-off trials using a progressive exclusion of sessions closest to a 1:1 indifference point. The vertical lines on these plots represents the threshold used (1.39:1; see STAR Methods) to specifically test whether sessions away from 1:1 were affected by OFC inactivation. Another possible effect of OFC inactivation on the rats’ behavior would be a reduction in the consistency of the subjective preference revealed by a flattening of the choice curve. To assess the sharpness of the subjective preference, we also analyzed the inverse slope (σ) of the sigmoidal fit (Figure 4). A mixed three-way ANOVA comparing the inverse slope across conditions found no significant main effects or interactions (Main effects, Fiber: F(1,100) = 3.12, p = 0.080; Laser: F(1,100) = 0.37, p = 0.54; Virus: F(1,100) = 0.04, p = 0.84; Two-way interactions, Fiber∗Laser: F(1,100) = 0.25, p = 0.62; Fiber∗Virus: F(1,100) = 0.02, p = 0.89; Laser∗Virus: F(1,100) = 0.74, p = 0.39; Three-way interaction, Fiber∗Laser∗Virus: F(1,100) = 0.29, p = 0.59, n > 106 for p = 0.05). Finally, we also conducted three targeted pairwise comparisons for the effects of OFC inactivation. The first tested for the effects of laser (on/off) using only data gathered with patent fibers on halo rats (Figures 3B and 4B, y axis, yellow points and histogram, IP, and inverse slope), the second tested for effects of fiber (blocked/patent) using only data gathered during laser-on trials in halo rats (see comparison in Figures 3A and 4A of top and bottom yellow histograms for the halo group, IP, and inverse slope), and the third tested for effects of virus (eYFP/halo) using only data gathered during laser-on trials and with patent cables (see comparison in Figures 3A and 4A of the bottom colored histograms in both columns, IP, and inverse slope). While these comparisons normally might be deemed statistically inappropriate since they are not well controlled, we thought it was important to ensure that we had not buried a significant effect under an unfair burden of control conditions. In no case was there any effect of the relevant manipulation of IP (paired t test, laser, p = 0.18; fiber, p = 0.35; unpaired t test, virus, p = 0.23; tests are uncorrected for multiple comparisons) or for the slope (paired t test, laser, p"
https://openalex.org/W2770171520,"Coordinating angiogenesis with acquisition of tissue-specific properties in endothelial cells is essential for vascular function. In the retina, endothelial cells form a blood-retina barrier by virtue of tight junctions and low transcytosis. While the canonical Norrin/Fz4/Lrp5/6 pathway is essential for angiogenesis, vascular remodeling, and barrier maturation, how these diverse processes are coordinated remains poorly understood. Here we demonstrate that Apcdd1, a negative regulator of Wnt/β-catenin signaling, is expressed in retinal endothelial cells during angiogenesis and barrier formation. Apcdd1-deficient mice exhibit a transient increase in vessel density at ages P10-P12 due to delayed vessel pruning. Moreover, Apcdd1 mutant endothelial cells precociously form the paracellular component of the barrier. Conversely, mice that overexpress Apcdd1 in retina endothelial cells have reduced vessel density but increased paracellular barrier permeability. Apcdd1 thus serves to precisely modulate Wnt/Norrin signaling activity in the retinal endothelium and coordinate the timing of both vascular pruning and barrier maturation."
https://openalex.org/W2768569010,"Protein kinase A (PKA) integrates inputs from G-protein-coupled neuromodulator receptors to modulate synaptic and cellular function. Gαs signaling stimulates PKA activity, whereas Gαi inhibits PKA activity. Gαq, on the other hand, signals through phospholipase C, and it remains unclear whether Gαq-coupled receptors signal to PKA in their native context. Here, using two independent optical reporters of PKA activity in acute mouse hippocampus slices, we show that endogenous Gαq-coupled muscarinic acetylcholine receptors activate PKA. Mechanistically, this effect is mediated by parallel signaling via either calcium or protein kinase C. Furthermore, multiple Gαq-coupled receptors modulate phosphorylation by PKA, a classical Gαs/Gαi effector. Thus, these results highlight PKA as a biochemical integrator of three major types of GPCRs and necessitate reconsideration of classic models used to predict neuronal signaling in response to the large family of Gαq-coupled receptors."
https://openalex.org/W2770266839,"Objective Epidemiological studies indicate associations between childhood exposure with phthalates and bisphenol A (BPA) and the pubertal development. We examined associations between the pre-pubertal phthalate and BPA body burden and the longitudinally assessed sexual maturation of eight- to thirteen-year-old children. Methods We started with eight- to ten-year-old children in the baseline study and quantified phthalate metabolites and BPA in 472 urine samples (250 boys; 222 girls; mean age: 8.8 years). Associations between the pubertal development, assessed in three annual follow-up studies by Puberty Development scale questionnaires (PD scales), and the chemical exposure from the baseline visit were longitudinally analyzed with generalized estimation equations. Results The number of children with both chemical measures and PD scores (calculated from the PD scales) was 408. In the third follow-up, 49% of the girls and 18% of the boys had reached mid-puberty. For girls, we observed a delayed pubertal development with the di-hexyl-ethyl phthalate (DEHP) metabolites (β: -0.16 to -0.23; p ≤ 0.05 or p ≤ 0.1), mono-n-butyl phthalate (β: -0.15; 95% CI: -0.31; 0.01), mono-benzyl phthalate (β: -0.11; 95% CI: -0,24; -0,01), and mono-ethyl phthalate (MEP) (β: -0.15; 95% CI: -0.28; -0.01). In addition, significant non-linear associations of the DEHP metabolites and BPA with the PD scores were found, when their quadratic effects were included in the GEE models. In boys, no consistent relationships between the PD scores and the chemicals were detected except of an accelerated development with the ∑DEHP metabolites (β: 0.16; 95% CI: -0.02; -0.34). Conclusion We found indications that pre-pubertal exposures with phthalates and BPA were associated with pubertal timing in children, particularly in girls. For boys, associations were inconsistent, and not necessarily in line with the known anti-androgenicity of some phthalates during prenatal exposure."

A second objective was to compare direct medical costs for ambulatory care between treatment groups.Patients were selected from a representative sample of the real world administrative claims database using an algorithm developed by experts from the scientific committee of the study. Data were matched with the medico-administrative database for hospital care. A Cox proportional hazards model was stratified for the treatment group and adjusted for available socio-demographic and medical covariates to compare restricted mean survival times at different time points (1, 3, 5 and 7.5 years) between groups. Costs were expressed in 2013 euros.A total of 14,782 patients were treated for knee osteoarthritis (67% women; mean age = 68 years). Among this population, 1,662 patients had total knee replacement (11.2%). At each time point, restricted mean survival time without total knee replacement was significantly higher (p-values<0.001) for hyaluronic acid group, from +51 to +217 days at 1 and 7.5 years, respectively. For the year preceding total knee replacement, the means for total direct medical costs were similar between groups, €744 vs €805 for treatment and control groups, respectively, (p-value = 0.104). Intra-articular injections accounted for less than 10% of the total costs.This is the first retrospective longitudinal study involving knee osteoarthritis patients using medico-administrative databases in France. The results support the effectiveness of hyaluronic acid injections in delaying total knee replacement and show that patients treated with hyaluronic acid have similar direct medical costs for ambulatory care compared to patients treated with corticosteroids only."
https://openalex.org/W2769025277,"The oviductal microenvironment is a site for key events that involve gamete maturation, fertilization and early embryo development. Secretions into the oviductal lumen by either the lining epithelium or by transudation of plasma constituents are known to contain elements conducive for reproductive success. Although previous studies have identified some of these factors involved in reproduction, knowledge of secreted proteins in the oviductal fluid remains rudimentary with limited definition of function even in extensively studied species like cattle. In this study, we used a shotgun proteomics approach followed by bioinformatics sequence prediction to identify secreted proteins present in the bovine oviductal fluid (ex vivo) and secretions from the bovine oviductal epithelial cells (in vitro). From a total of 2087 proteins identified, 266 proteins could be classified as secreted, 109 (41%) of which were common for both in vivo and in vitro conditions. Pathway analysis indicated different classes of proteins that included growth factors, metabolic regulators, immune modulators, enzymes, and extracellular matrix components. Functional analysis revealed mechanisms in the oviductal lumen linked to immune homeostasis, gamete maturation, fertilization and early embryo development. These results point to several novel components that work together with known elements mediating functional homeostasis, and highlight the diversity of machinery associated with oviductal physiology and early events in cattle fertility."
https://openalex.org/W2768106423,"Background We explored host-related factors associated with the site of tuberculosis (TB) disease using variables routinely collected by the 31 EU/EEA countries for national surveillance. Methods Logistic regression models were fitted to case-based surveillance data reported to the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control for TB cases notified from 2003 to 2014. Missing data on HIV infection and on susceptibility to isoniazid and rifampicin for many patients precluded the inclusion of these variables in the analysis. Records from Finland, Lithuania, Spain and the United Kingdom were excluded for lack of exact details of disease localisation; other records without one or more variable (e.g. previous treatment history, geographical origin) or who had mixed pulmonary and extrapulmonary disease or more than one form of extrapulmonary disease were also removed (total exclusion = 38% of 913,637 notifications). Results 564,916 TB cases reported by 27 EU/EEA countries had exclusive pulmonary (PTB; 83%) or extrapulmonary (EPTB; 17%) disease. EPTB was associated with age <15 years (aOR: 5.50), female sex (aOR: 1.60), no previous TB treatment (aOR: 3.10), and geographic origin (aOR range: 0.52–3.74). Origin from the Indian subcontinent or Africa was most strongly associated with lymphatic, osteo-articular and peritoneal/digestive localization (aOR>3.7), and age <15 years with lymphatic (aOR: 17.96) and central nervous system disease (aOR: 11.41). Conclusions Awareness of host-related determinants of site of TB is useful for diagnosis. The predilection for EPTB among patients originating from countries outside Europe may reflect strain preferences for disease localization, geographic/ethnic differences in disease manifestation and other factors, like HIV."
https://openalex.org/W2769745858,"Cassava is the main staple food for over 800 million people globally. Its production in eastern Africa is being constrained by two devastating Ipomoviruses that cause cassava brown streak disease (CBSD); Cassava brown streak virus (CBSV) and Ugandan cassava brown streak virus (UCBSV), with up to 100% yield loss for smallholder farmers in the region. To date, vector studies have not resulted in reproducible and highly efficient transmission of CBSV and UCBSV. Most virus transmission studies have used Bemisia tabaci (whitefly), but a maximum of 41% U/CBSV transmission efficiency has been documented for this vector. With the advent of next generation sequencing, researchers are generating whole genome sequences for both CBSV and UCBSV from throughout eastern Africa. Our initial goal for this study was to characterize U/CBSV whole genomes from CBSD symptomatic cassava plants sampled in Kenya. We have generated 8 new whole genomes (3 CBSV and 5 UCBSV) from Kenya, and in the process of analyzing these genomes together with 26 previously published sequences, we uncovered the aphid transmission associated DAG motif within coat protein genes of all CBSV whole genomes at amino acid positions 52-54, but not in UCBSV. Upon further investigation, the DAG motif was also found at the same positions in two other Ipomoviruses: Squash vein yellowing virus (SqVYV), Coccinia mottle virus (CocMoV). Until this study, the highly-conserved DAG motif, which is associated with aphid transmission was only noticed once, in SqVYV but discounted as being of minimal importance. This study represents the first comprehensive look at Ipomovirus genomes to determine the extent of DAG motif presence and significance for vector relations. The presence of this motif suggests that aphids could potentially be a vector of CBSV, SqVYV and CocMov. Further transmission and ipomoviral protein evolutionary studies are needed to confirm this hypothesis."
https://openalex.org/W2768563038,"Accurate monitoring of sedentary behaviour and physical activity is key to investigate their exact role in healthy ageing. To date, accelerometers using cut-off point models are most preferred for this, however, machine learning seems a highly promising future alternative. Hence, the current study compared between cut-off point and machine learning algorithms, for optimal quantification of sedentary behaviour and physical activity intensities in the elderly. Thus, in a heterogeneous sample of forty participants (aged ≥60 years, 50% female) energy expenditure during laboratory-based activities (ranging from sedentary behaviour through to moderate-to-vigorous physical activity) was estimated by indirect calorimetry, whilst wearing triaxial thigh-mounted accelerometers. Three cut-off point algorithms and a Random Forest machine learning model were developed and cross-validated using the collected data. Detailed analyses were performed to check algorithm robustness, and examine and benchmark both overall and participant-specific balanced accuracies. This revealed that the four models can at least be used to confidently monitor sedentary behaviour and moderate-to-vigorous physical activity. Nevertheless, the machine learning algorithm outperformed the cut-off point models by being robust for all individual's physiological and non-physiological characteristics and showing more performance of an acceptable level over the whole range of physical activity intensities. Therefore, we propose that Random Forest machine learning may be optimal for objective assessment of sedentary behaviour and physical activity in older adults using thigh-mounted triaxial accelerometry."

Ground-dwelling arthropods were collected using bulk sampling of soil and litter, and pitfall sampling. Arthropods were sampled once before and twice after treatment of plots with either Met52 or water (control). Multivariate general linear models were used to jointly model the abundance of arthropod orders. For each sampling method and post-spray sampling occasion, Akaike Information Criterion values were used to compare the fits of two alternative models: one that included effects of period (before vs. after spray), habitat (lawn vs. forest), and treatment (Met52 vs. control), versus a nested null model that included effects of period, and habitat, but no treatment effect. The null model was consistently better supported by the data. Significant effects were found of period and habitat but not treatment. Retrospective power analysis indicated the study had 80% power to detect a 50% reduction in arthropod abundance, as measured by bulk samples taken before versus one week after treatment. The deployment of Met52 in suburban settings is unlikely to cause meaningful reductions in the abundance of non-target arthropods."
https://openalex.org/W2770812943,"Alterations in Ca2+ homeostasis affect neuronal survival. However, the identity of Ca2+ channels and the mechanisms underlying neurotoxin-induced neuronal degeneration are not well understood. In this study, the dopaminergic neurotoxins 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) and 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridium ions (MPP+)/1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP), which mimic Parkinson's disease (PD), induced neuronal degeneration by decreasing store-mediated Ca2+ entry. The function of the transient receptor potential canonical (TRPC)-1 channel was decreased upon exposure to the neurotoxins, followed by a decrease in TRPC1 expression. Similar to neurotoxins, samples from patients with PD exhibited attenuated TRPC1 expression, which was accompanied by a decrease in autophagic markers and a subsequent increase in apoptosis markers. Furthermore, exposure to neurotoxins attenuated PKC phosphorylation, decreased expression of autophagic markers, and increased apoptosis in SHSY-5Y neuroblastoma cells, which was again dependent on TRPC1. Prolonged neurotoxin treatment attenuated the binding of NF-κB to the TRPC1 promoter, which resulted in a decrease in TRPC1 expression, thereby attenuating autophagy and activating cell death. Restoration of TRPC1 expression rescued the effects of the dopaminergic neurotoxins in neuroblastoma cells by increasing Ca2+ entry, restoring NF-κB activity, and promoting autophagy. Overall, these results suggest that dopaminergic neurotoxins initially decreased Ca2+ entry, which inhibited the binding of NF-κB to the TRPC1 promoter, thereby inhibiting TRPC1 expression and resulting in cell death by preventing autophagy.-Sukumaran, P., Sun, Y., Antonson, N., Singh, B.

https://openalex.org/W2768179065,"The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of institutional and policy interventions on reducing the rate of cesarean delivery on maternal request (CDMR) in Wenzhou, China. Institutional interventions included health education, painless delivery introduction, and doula care. Additionally, a series of health policies were developed by the Chinese central and local governments to control cesarean section rates, mostly through controlling CDMR rates. We conducted a pre-/post-intervention study using 131,312 deliveries between 2006 and 2014 in three tertiary-level public hospitals in Wenzhou, China. Chi-square tests and predictive models were used to examine changes in the CDMR rate before and after institutional and policy interventions. After institutional interventions were introduced, the overall CDMR rate increased from 15.76% to 16.34% (p = 0.053), but the average annual growth rate (AAGR) of the overall CDMR rate quickly declined from 20.11% to -4.30%. After policy interventions were introduced, the overall CDMR rate, the AAGR of the overall CDMR rate, and the probability of performing CDMR declined. Further, the overall probability of a woman undergoing CDMR decreased in all three age groups (group one: <24; group two: 24–34; group three: >34) after institutional and policy interventions. These results show that institutional and policy interventions can reduce the CDMR rate. Additionally, the CDMR rate should be included in hospitals’ performance assessment matrix to reduce the CDMR rate further."
https://openalex.org/W2768701785,"CD40/CD40 ligand (CD40L) dyad, a co-stimulatory bi-molecular complex involved in the adaptive immune response, has also potent pro-inflammatory actions in haematopoietic and non-haematopoietic cells. We describe here a novel role for soluble CD40L (sCD40L) as modifier of glomerular permselectivity directly acting on glomerular epithelial cells (GECs). We found that stimulation of CD40, constitutively expressed on GEC cell membrane, by the sCD40L rapidly induced redistribution and loss of nephrin in GECs, and increased albumin permeability in isolated rat glomeruli. Pre-treatment with inhibitors of CD40-CD40L interaction completely prevented these effects. Furthermore, in vivo injection of sCD40L induced a significant reduction of nephrin and podocin expression in mouse glomeruli, although no significant increase of urine protein/creatinine ratio was observed after in vivo injection. The same effects were induced by plasma factors partially purified from post-transplant plasma exchange eluates of patients with focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS), and were blocked by CD40-CD40L inhibitors. Moreover, 17 and 34 kDa sCD40L isoforms were detected in the same plasmapheresis eluates by Western blotting. Finally, the levels of sCD40Lwere significantly increased in serum of children both with steroid-sensitive and steroid-resistant nephrotic syndrome (NS), and in adult patients with biopsy-proven FSGS, compared to healthy subjects, but neither in children with congenital NS nor in patients with membranous nephropathy. Our results demonstrate that sCD40L directly modifies nephrin and podocin distribution in GECs. Moreover, they suggest that sCD40L contained in plasmapheresis eluates from FSGS patients with post-transplant recurrence may contribute, presumably cooperating with other mediators, to FSGS pathogenesis by modulating glomerular permeability."

Thirty-four African-American women (age, 24.5±5.2 years; BMI, 24.9±4.5 kg/m2) had daily activity measured simultaneously with an AG-GT3X+ accelerometer and a New Lifestyles NL-800 pedometer for seven days. Steps per day (steps/day) and time (minutes/day) spent in sedentary, light, and moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) were examined with and without the LFE filter (AG-LFE and AG-N, respectively). The AG-LFE recorded more total steps (13,723±4,983 steps/day) compared to AG-N and NL-800 (6,172±2,838 and 5,817±3,037 steps/day, respectively; p<0.001). Compared to the AG-N, the AG-LFE estimated less time in sedentary behaviors (518.7±92.1 vs. 504.2±105.4 min/day, respectively; p<0.001), and more time in light (247.7±70.4 vs. 279.1±74.7 min/day, respectively; p<0.001) and MVPA (18.9±16.9 vs. 21.5±18.2 min/day, respectively; p<0.001), respectively.

Future research should investigate the accuracy of these measures using the LFE filter."
https://openalex.org/W2769279040,"Motor skills depend on the reuse of individual gestures in multiple sequential contexts (e.g., a single phoneme in different words). Yet optimal performance requires that a given gesture be modified appropriately depending on the sequence in which it occurs. To investigate the neural architecture underlying such context-dependent modifications, we studied Bengalese finch song, which, like speech, consists of variable sequences of “syllables.” We found that when birds are instructed to modify a syllable in one sequential context, learning generalizes across contexts; however, if unique instruction is provided in different contexts, learning is specific for each context. Using localized inactivation of a cortical-basal ganglia circuit specialized for song, we show that this balance between generalization and specificity reflects a hierarchical organization of neural substrates. Primary motor circuitry encodes a core syllable representation that contributes to generalization, while top-down input from cortical-basal ganglia circuitry biases this representation to enable context-specific learning."
https://openalex.org/W2768953592,"The two sister peptides, pituitary adenylate cyclase activating polypeptide (PACAP) and vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP) and their receptors, the PAC1 -and the VPAC2 receptors, are involved in regulation of the circadian timing system. PACAP as a neurotransmitter in the retinohypothalamic tract (RHT) and VIP as a neurotransmitter, involved in synchronization of SCN neurons. Behavior and physiology in VPAC2 deficient mice are strongly regulated by light most likely as a result of masking. Consequently, we used VPAC2 and PAC1/VPAC2 double mutant mice in comparison with PAC1 receptor deficient mice to further elucidate the role of PACAP in the light mediated regulation of behavior and physiology of the circadian system. We compared circadian rhythms in mice equipped with running wheels or implanted radio-transmitter measuring core body temperature kept in a full photoperiod ((FPP)(12:12 h light dark-cycles (LD)) and skeleton photo periods (SPP) at high and low light intensity. Furthermore, we examined the expression of PAC1- and VPAC2 receptors in the SCN of the different genotypes in combination with visualization of PACAP and VIP and determined whether compensatory changes in peptide and/or receptor expression in the reciprocal knockouts (KO) (PAC1 and VPAC2) had occurred. Our data demonstrate that in although being closely related at both ligand and receptor structure/sequence, PACAP/PAC1 receptor signaling are independent of VIP/VPAC2 receptor signaling and vice versa. Furthermore, lack of either of the receptors does not result in compensatory changes at neither the physiological or anatomical level. PACAP/PAC1 signaling is important for light regulated behavior, VIP/VPAC2signaling for stable clock function and both signaling pathways may play a role in shaping diurnality versus nocturnality."

https://openalex.org/W2769773142,"Soil fungi associated with plant roots, notably ectomycorrhizal (EcM) fungi, are central in above- and below-ground interactions in Mediterranean forests. They are a key component in soil nutrient cycling and plant productivity. Yet, major disturbances of Mediterranean forests, particularly in the Southern Mediterranean basin, are observed due to the greater human pressures and climate changes. These disturbances highly impact forest cover, soil properties and consequently the root-associated fungal communities. The implementation of efficient conservation strategies of Mediterranean forests is thus closely tied to our understanding of root-associated fungal biodiversity and environmental rules driving its diversity and structure. In our study, the root-associated fungal community of Q. suber was analyzed using high-throughput sequencing across three major Moroccan cork oak habitats. Significant differences in root-associated fungal community structures of Q. suber were observed among Moroccan cork oak habitats (Maâmora, Benslimane, Chefchaoun) subjected to different human disturbance levels (high to low disturbances, respectively). The fungal community structure changes correlated with a wide range of soil properties, notably with pH, C:N ratio (P = 0.0002), and available phosphorus levels (P = 0.0001). More than 90 below-ground fungal indicators (P < 0.01)–either of a type of habitat and/or a soil property–were revealed. The results shed light on the ecological significance of ubiquitous ectomycorrhiza (Tomentella, Russula, Cenococcum), and putative sclerotia-associated/ericoid mycorrhizal fungal taxa (Cladophialophora, Oidiodendron) in the Moroccan cork oak forest, and their intraspecific variability regarding their response to land use and soil characteristics."
https://openalex.org/W2768508185,"Background Polymicrobial communities colonize all wounds, and biofilms are hypothesized to be a key link to the chronic state and stalled healing. Molecular methods offer greater insight when studying microbial ecology in chronic wounds, as only a small fraction of wound bacteria are cultured by currently available methods and studies have shown little agreement between culture and molecular based approaches. Some interventions, like dressings with oxidized silver, are reported to help the stalled wounds move to a normal healing trajectory but the underlying mechanisms are difficult to measure. One hypothesis is that the use of topical antimicrobial dressings targets the wound microbiome and reduces bioburden. Objectives Our objective was to determine if culture-independent molecular methods could be used to identify the microbial composition in chronic wounds, and measure the microbiome over time when a topical antimicrobial dressing is used to reduce bioburden. Methods Patients with chronic wounds defined as >6 weeks in duration and not taking systemic antibiotics were recruited to participate. A wound contact layer containing silver oxynitrate was applied immediately after routine sharp debridement material was collected and swabs of the wound bed taken. Next-generation sequencing of the bacterial 16S rRNA gene in each specimen was used to measure the microbiome. Results Distinct bacterial communities were observed between swab and debridement samples, highlighting spatial differences and the importance of sampling consistency. The microbial communities appeared to be similar between different diabetes statuses, but different among the three wound categories included. Conclusions Culture-independent methods can be applied to measure the microbiome of chronic wounds even when a topical antimicrobial dressing is applied to the wound."
https://openalex.org/W2769311693,"There is a significant clinical need to improve current therapeutic approaches to treat ocular surface injuries and disease, which affect hundreds of millions of people annually worldwide. The work presented here demonstrates that the presence of Silk-Derived Protein (SDP) on the healing rabbit corneal surface, administered in an eye drop formulation, corresponds with an enhanced epithelial wound healing profile. Rabbit corneas were denuded of their epithelial surface, and then treated for 72-hours with either PBS or PBS containing 5 or 20 mg/mL SDP in solution four times per day. Post-injury treatment with SDP formulations was found to accelerate the acute healing phase of the injured rabbit corneal epithelium. In addition, the use of SDP corresponded with an enhanced tissue healing profile through the formation of a multi-layered epithelial surface with increased tight junction formation. Additional biological effects were also revealed that included increased epithelial proliferation, and increased focal adhesion formation with a corresponding reduction in the presence of MMP-9 enzyme. These in vivo findings demonstrate for the first time that the presence of SDP on the injured ocular surface may aid to improve various steps of rabbit corneal wound healing, and provides evidence that SDP may have applicability as an ingredient in therapeutic ophthalmic formulations."
https://openalex.org/W2768588846,"S. cerevisiae from different environments are subject to a wide range of selective pressures, whether intentional or by happenstance. Chemicals classified by their application, such as herbicides, fungicides and antibiotics, can affect non-target organisms. First marketed as RoundUp™, glyphosate is the most widely used herbicide. In plants, glyphosate inhibits EPSPS, of the shikimate pathway, which is present in many organisms but lacking in mammals. The shikimate pathway produces chorismate which is the precursor to all the aromatic amino acids, para-aminobenzoic acid, and Coenzyme Q10. Crops engineered to be resistant to glyphosate contain a homolog of EPSPS that is not bound by glyphosate. Here, we show that S. cerevisiae has a wide-range of glyphosate resistance. Sequence comparison between the target proteins, i.e., the plant EPSPS and the yeast orthologous protein Aro1, predicted that yeast would be resistant to glyphosate. However, the growth variation seen in the subset of yeast tested was not due to polymorphisms within Aro1, instead, it was caused by genetic variation in an ABC multiple drug transporter, Pdr5, and an amino acid permease, Dip5. Using genetic variation as a probe into glyphosate response, we uncovered mechanisms that contribute to the transportation of glyphosate in and out of the cell. Taking advantage of the natural genetic variation within yeast and measuring growth under different conditions that would change the use of the shikimate pathway, we uncovered a general transport mechanism of glyphosate into eukaryotic cells."
https://openalex.org/W2768476834,"Background We aimed to describe the field experiences and recommendations of clinic-based health care providers (HCP) regarding the implementation of universal antiretroviral therapy (ART) in rural KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa. Methods In Hlabisa sub-district, the local HIV programme of the Department of Health (DoH) is decentralized in 18 clinics, where ART was offered at a CD4 count ≤500 cells/μL from January 2015 to September 2016. Within the ANRS 12249 TasP trial, implemented in part of the sub-district, universal ART (no eligibility criteria) was offered in 11 mobile clinics between March 2012 and June 2016. A cross-sectional qualitative survey was conducted in April–July 2016 among clinic-based nurses and counsellors providing HIV care in the DoH and TasP trial clinics. In total, 13 individual interviews and two focus groups discussions (including 6 and 7 participants) were conducted, audio-recorded, transcribed, and thematically analyzed. Results All HCPs reported an overall good experience of delivering ART early in the course of HIV infection, with most patients willing to initiate ART before being symptomatic. Yet, HCPs underlined that not feeling sick could challenge early ART initiation and adherence, and thus highlighted the need to take time for counselling as an important component to achieve universal ART. HCPs also foresaw logistical challenges of universal ART, and were especially concerned about increasing workload and ART shortage. HCPs finally recommended the need to strengthen the existing model of care to facilitate access to ART, e.g., community-based and integrated HIV services. Conclusions The provision of universal ART is feasible and acceptable according to HCPs in this rural South-African area. However their experiences suggest that universal ART, and more generally the 90-90-90 UNAIDS targets, will be difficult to achieve without the implementation of new models of health service delivery."

The aim of this study was to interview people aged 18–34 year old living in four cities in different regions of the world to explore differences in a range of alcohol measures to assist in determining culturally appropriate alcohol initiatives for this age group. Method Multistage random sampling was consistent across the four cities (Ilorin (Nigeria), Wuhan (China), Montevideo (Uruguay) and Moscow (Russia)). The questionnaire was forward and back translated into relevant languages and face-to-face interviewing undertaken. The data were weighted to the population of each city. Uni-variable analysis (ever consumed, first time consumed, age when drunk for first time, number of days consumed, type consumed) and logistic regression modeling were undertaken. The final model for each city was adjusted for age, sex, marital status, highest education and employment status. In total 6235 interviews were undertaken (1391 in Ilorin, 1600 in Montevideo, 1604 in Moscow and 1640 in Wuhan). Results Alcohol was consumed by 96.4% in Montevideo, 86.1% in Moscow, 53.4% in Wuhan and 33.3% in Ilorin. There was very little difference by gender except Ilorin males were more likely to consume alcohol than females. Alcohol was consumed on more days for Ilorin males; Wuhan females consumed alcohol on the least number of days; Ilorin had the most abstainers; Montevideo and Moscow the highest proportion of light drinkers; Ilorin and Montevideo the highest proportion of heavy drinkers. Differences by type of alcohol were also apparent. The final logistic regression model provided different models including higher alcohol consumption rates for males, 25–34 years of age, divorced/separated marital status and employed part time for Ilorin respondents; males and higher educated for Montevideo; males, 25 to 29 years of age and higher educated for Moscow; and 25–29 years of age, non-married and vocationally trained for those in Wuhan. Conclusion Alcohol consumption in these four cities does not increase with age as found in most high income countries. The alcohol consumption patterns during this stage of the life cycle are important to assess so that high level, as well as country-specific, planning and interventions can be implemented."

Median age was 16.0 (IQR 15.0-17.0) years and 3189 (53.9%) students were males. Most students were Sinhalese (65.7%), with fewer Tamils (23.1%) and Muslims (11.2%). Anaemia occurred in 470 students and was more common in females (11.1%) than males (5.6%). Haemoglobin, serum ferritin, transferrin receptor and iron were determined in 1196 students with low red cell indices and a structured sample of those with normal red cell indices (n = 513). The findings were weighted to estimate the frequencies of iron deficiency and iron deficiency anaemia classified according to WHO criteria. Iron depletion (serum ferritin <15ug/ml) occurred in 19.2% and cellular iron deficiency (low serum ferritin and transferrin receptor >28.1 nmol/l) in 11.6% students. Iron deficiency anaemia (cellular iron deficiency with low haemoglobin) occurred in only 130/2794 (4.6%) females and 28/2789 (1.0%) males. Iron biomarkers were normal in 83/470 (14.6%) students with anaemia. In multiple regression analysis, the odds for iron depletion and cellular iron deficiency were about one-third in males compared with females, and the odds for iron deficiency anaemia were about one fifth in males compared to females. Tamil ethnicity and age <16 years increased the risk of all three stages of iron deficiency and living at high altitude significantly reduced the risk of iron depletion.Low iron status and anaemia remain common problems in Sri Lankan secondary school students especially females, younger students and the socioeconomically disadvantaged Tamil population. More research is needed to identify factors other than low iron status that contribute to anaemia in adolescents."
https://openalex.org/W2768761539,"The final adjustment of urine volume occurs in the inner medullary collecting duct (IMCD), chiefly mediated by the water channel aquaporin 2 (AQP2). With vasopressin stimulation, AQP2 accumulation in the apical plasma membrane of principal cells allows water reabsorption from the lumen. We report that FXYD1 (phospholemman), better known as a regulator of Na,K-ATPase, has a role in AQP2 trafficking. Daytime urine of Fxyd1 knockout mice was more dilute than WT despite similar serum vasopressin, but both genotypes could concentrate urine during water deprivation. FXYD1 was found in IMCD. In WT mice, phosphorylated FXYD1 was detected intracellularly, and vasopressin induced its dephosphorylation. We tested the hypothesis that the dilute urine in knockouts was caused by alteration of AQP2 trafficking. In WT mice at baseline, FXYD1 and AQP2 were not strongly co-localized, but elevation of vasopressin produced translocation of both FXYD1 and AQP2 to the apical plasma membrane. In kidney slices, baseline AQP2 distribution was more scattered in the Fxyd1 knockout than in WT. Apical recruitment of AQP2 occurred in vasopressin-treated Fxyd1 knockout slices, but upon vasopressin washout, there was more rapid reversal of apical AQP2 localization and more heterogeneous cytoplasmic distribution of AQP2. Notably, in sucrose gradients, AQP2 was present in a detergent-resistant membrane domain that had lower sedimentation density in the knockout than in WT, and vasopressin treatment normalized its density. We propose that FXYD1 plays a role in regulating AQP2 retention in apical membrane, and that this involves transfers between raft-like membrane domains in endosomes and plasma membranes."
https://openalex.org/W2768717050,"HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (or “statins”) are important and commonly used medications to lower cholesterol and prevent cardiovascular disease. Nearly half of patients stop taking statin medications one year after they are prescribed leading to higher cholesterol, increased cardiovascular risk, and costs due to excess hospitalizations. Identifying which patients are at highest risk for not adhering to long-term statin therapy is an important step towards individualizing interventions to improve adherence. Electronic health records (EHR) are an increasingly common source of data that are challenging to analyze but have potential for generating more accurate predictions of disease risk. The aim of this study was to build an EHR based model for statin adherence and link this model to biologic and clinical outcomes in patients receiving statin therapy. We gathered EHR data from the Military Health System which maintains administrative data for active duty, retirees, and dependents of the United States armed forces military that receive health care benefits. Data were gathered from patients prescribed their first statin prescription in 2005 and 2006. Baseline billing, laboratory, and pharmacy claims data were collected from the two years leading up to the first statin prescription and summarized using non-negative matrix factorization. Follow up statin prescription refill data was used to define the adherence outcome (> 80 percent days covered). The subsequent factors to emerge from this model were then used to build cross-validated, predictive models of 1) overall disease risk using coalescent regression and 2) statin adherence (using random forest regression). The predicted statin adherence for each patient was subsequently used to correlate with cholesterol lowering and hospitalizations for cardiovascular disease during the 5 year follow up period using Cox regression. The analytical dataset included 138 731 individuals and 1840 potential baseline predictors that were reduced to 30 independent EHR “factors”. A random forest predictive model taking patient, statin prescription, predicted disease risk, and the EHR factors as potential inputs produced a cross-validated c-statistic of 0.736 for classifying statin non-adherence. The addition of the first refill to the model increased the c-statistic to 0.81. The predicted statin adherence was independently associated with greater cholesterol lowering (correlation = 0.14, p < 1e-20) and lower hospitalization for myocardial infarction, coronary artery disease, and stroke (hazard ratio = 0.84, p = 1.87E-06). Electronic health records data can be used to build a predictive model of statin adherence that also correlates with statins’ cardiovascular benefits."
https://openalex.org/W2949468153,"Complement is an important pathway in innate immunity, inflammation, and many disease processes. However, despite its importance, there are few validated mathematical models of complement activation. In this study, we developed an ensemble of experimentally validated reduced order complement models. We combined ordinary differential equations with logical rules to produce a compact yet predictive model of complement activation. The model, which described the lectin and alternative pathways, was an order of magnitude smaller than comparable models in the literature. We estimated an ensemble of model parameters from in vitro dynamic measurements of the C3a and C5a complement proteins. Subsequently, we validated the model on unseen C3a and C5a measurements not used for model training. Despite its small size, the model was surprisingly predictive. Global sensitivity and robustness analysis suggested complement was robust to any single therapeutic intervention. Only the simultaneous knockdown of both C3 and C5 consistently reduced C3a and C5a formation from all pathways. Taken together, we developed a validated mathematical model of complement activation that was computationally inexpensive, and could easily be incorporated into pre-existing or new pharmacokinetic models of immune system function. The model described experimental data, and predicted the need for multiple points of therapeutic intervention to fully disrupt complement activation."
https://openalex.org/W2769559976,"The cbb3 oxidase has a high affinity for oxygen and is required for growth of bacteria, including pathogens, in oxygen-limited environments. However, the assembly of this oxidase is poorly understood. Most cbb3 are composed of four subunits: the catalytic CcoN subunit, the two cytochrome c subunits (CcoO and CcoP) involved in electron transfer, and the small CcoQ subunit with an unclear function. Here, we address the role of these four subunits in cbb3 biogenesis in the purple bacterium Rubrivivax gelatinosus Analyses of membrane proteins from different mutants revealed the presence of active CcoNQO and CcoNO subcomplexes and also showed that the CcoP subunit is not essential for their assembly. However, CcoP was required for the oxygen reduction activity in the absence of CcoQ. We also found that CcoQ is dispensable for forming an active CcoNOP subcomplex in membranes. CcoNOP exhibited oxygen reductase activity, indicating that the cofactors (hemes b and copper for CcoN and cytochromes c for CcoO and CcoP) were present within the subunits. Finally, we discovered the presence of a CcoNQ subcomplex and showed that CcoN is the required anchor for the assembly of the full CcoNQOP complex. On the basis of these findings, we propose a sequential assembly model in which the CcoQ subunit is required for the early maturation step: CcoQ first associates with CcoN before the CcoNQ-CcoO interaction. CcoP associates to CcoNQO subcomplex in the late maturation step, and once the CcoNQOP complex is fully formed, CcoQ is released for degradation by the FtsH protease. This model could be conserved in other bacteria, including the pathogenic bacteria lacking the assembly factor CcoH as in R. gelatinosus."

We used a rapid screening approach to test 504 novel electrophilic compounds for inhibition of Grx1, which has a highly reactive active-site cysteine residue (pKa 3.5). From this chemical library a chloroacetamido compound, CWR-J02, was identified as a potential lead compound to be characterized. CWR-J02 inhibited isolated Grx1 with an IC50 value of 32 μM in the presence of 1 mM glutathione. Mass spectrometric analysis documented preferential adduction of CWR-J02 to the active site Cys-22 of Grx1, and molecular dynamics simulation identified a potential non-covalent binding site. Treatment of the BV2 microglial cell line with CWR-J02 led to inhibition of intracellular Grx1 activity with an IC50 value (37 μM). CWR-J02 treatment decreased lipopolysaccharide-induced inflammatory gene transcription in the microglial cells in a parallel concentration-dependent manner, documenting the anti-inflammatory potential of CWR-J02. Exploiting the alkyne moiety of CWR-J02, we used click chemistry to link biotin azide to CWR-J02-adducted proteins, isolating them with streptavidin beads. Tandem mass spectrometric analysis identified many CWR-J02-reactive proteins, including Grx1 and several mediators of inflammatory activation. Taken together, these data identify CWR-J02 as an intracellularly effective Grx1 inhibitor that may elicit its anti-inflammatory action in a synergistic manner by also disabling other pro-inflammatory mediators. The CWR-J02 molecule provides a starting point for developing more selective Grx1 inhibitors and anti-inflammatory agents for therapeutic development."

The morphological types of TGA, the spatial relationship between the pulmonary artery and the aorta, as well as coronary artery-associated abnormalities were assessed by DSCT. In contrast to TTE, the diagnostic accuracy of associated malformations on DSCT were analyzed and calculated with reference to surgical or digital subtraction angiography (DSA) findings. Effective doses (EDs) were also calculated.Among the 25 patients, 12 (48%) had ventricular septal defects and left ventricular outflow tract stenosis. Sixteen patients (16/25, 64%) had great arteries with an oblique spatial relationship on DSCT. In addition, we found seven patients (7/25, 28%) with coronary artery malformation, including five with an abnormal coronary origin and two with signs of a myocardial bridge. According to DSA or surgical findings, DSCT was superior to TTE in demonstrating extracardiac anomalies (sensitivity, anomalies of great vessels: 100% vs. 93.33%, other anomalies: 100% vs. 46.15%). The mean estimated ED for those aged <10 years was <2 mSv (1.59 ± 0.95 mSv).DSCT can achieve an overall assessment of patients with TGA, including any associated malformations as well as the identification of the spatial relationship of the great arteries. DSCT can therefore be considered as an alternative imaging modality for surgical decision making."

If DNA repair systems default their roles at this stage, the organism can be damaged and result in disease, especially cancer. To better understand the cellular response to this form of damage, we applied highly sensitive mass spectrometry to perform comparative proteomics of phosphorylation in HeLa cells. A total of 4367 phosphorylation sites in 2100 proteins were identified, many of which had not been reported previously. Comprehensive bioinformatics analysis revealed that these proteins were involved in many important biological processes, including signaling, localization and cell cycle regulation. The nuclear pore complex, which is very important for RNA transport, was changed significantly at phosphorylation level, indicating its important role in response to UV-induced cellular stress. Protein-protein interaction network analysis and DNA repair pathways crosstalk were also examined in this study. Proteins involved in base excision repair, nucleotide repair and mismatch repair changed their phosphorylation pattern in response to UV treatment, indicating the complexity of cellular events and the coordination of these pathways. These systematic analyses provided new clues of protein phosphorylation in response to specific DNA damage, which is very important for further investigation. And give macroscopic view on an overall phosphorylation situation under UV radiation."
https://openalex.org/W2770270317,"Platelets are important for effective hemostasis and considered to be involved in pathophysiological processes, e.g. in cardiovascular diseases. Platelets provided for research or for therapeutic use are frequently separated from citrated whole blood (WB) stored for different periods of time. Although functionally intact platelets are required, the stability of platelet integrity, e.g. adenosine diphosphate (ADP) mediated responsiveness, has never been thoroughly investigated in citrated WB under ex vivo conditions.Platelet integrity was evaluated at different time points in citrated WB units, collected from healthy donors and stored for 5 days at ambient temperature. The analysis included the measurement of activation markers, of induced light transmission aggregometry and of purinergic receptor expression or function. Inhibitory pathways were explored by determination of basal vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein (VASP)-phosphorylation, intracellular cyclic nucleotide levels and the content of phosphodiesterase 5A. Fresh peripheral blood (PB) samples served as controls.On day 5 of storage, thrombin receptor activating peptide-6 (TRAP-6) stimulated CD62P expression and fibrinogen binding were comparable to PB samples. ADP induced aggregation continuously decreased during storage. Purinergic receptor expression remained unchanged, whereas the P2Y1 activity progressively declined in contrast to preserved P2Y12 and P2X1 function. Inhibitory pathways were unaffected except for a slight elevation of VASP phosphorylation at Ser239 on day 5.After 5 days of storage in citrated WB, platelet responsiveness to TRAP-6 is sufficiently maintained. However, ADP-mediated platelet integrity is more sensitive to deterioration, especially after storage for more than 2 days. Decreasing ADP-induced aggregation is particularly caused by the impairment of the purinergic receptor P2Y1 activity. These characteristics should be considered in the use of platelets from stored citrated WB for experimental or therapeutic issues."
https://openalex.org/W2771002633,"In several fields of research, like e.g. photosensitization, photovoltaics, organic electroluminescent devices, dynamic nuclear polarization, or pulsed dipolar electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy, triplet state kinetics play an important role. It is therefore desirable to tailor the kinetics of photoexcited triplet states, e.g. by exploiting the intramolecular heavy-atom effect, and to determine the respective kinetic parameters. In this work, we set out to systematically investigate the photoexcited triplet state kinetics of a series of haloanthracenes by time-resolved electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy in combination with synchronized laser excitation. For this purpose, a procedure to simulate time traces by solving the differential equation system governing the triplet kinetics numerically is developed. This way, spin lattice relaxation rates and zero-field triplet life times are obtained concurrently by a global fit to experimental data measured at three different cryogenic temperatures."
