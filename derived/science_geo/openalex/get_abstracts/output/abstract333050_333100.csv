Daphnia magna, fed mixtures of three sizes of polystyrene particles, retained particles that were smaller than the mesh size of the animals (1.0 micrometer) at greater efficiencies than predicted by a sieving model. Retention efficiency of the smallest particles (0.5 micrometer) was increased when negative surface charge on the particles was neutralized, and retention was decreased when a nonionic surfactant was, added to reduce wettability."

Most of the waters sampled are several thousand to more than 10,000 years old, and some are 80 kilometers from their point of recharge."

https://openalex.org/W1982248258,"Nuclear magnetic resonance relaxation measurements at high pressure provide unique information about the microscopic behavior of liquids. This article presents the principles of this technique; illustrates its usefulness by several specific examples of studies of molecular liquids, water, and supercritical dense fluids; and indicates the promising future of high-resolution nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy at high pressure with examples of studies of chemical exchange and homogeneous catalytic processes."

The localization of calcium in the gravity-sensing organelle suggests a possible role of calcium in the gravity-sensing mechanism of plant roots."
https://openalex.org/W2079202314,It has been suggested that naturally occurring copper and zinc concentrations in deep seawater are toxic to marine organisms when the free ion forms are overabundant. The effects of micronutrients on the growth of gametophytes of the ecologically and commercially significant giant kelp (Macrocystis pyrifera) were studied in defined media. The results indicate that toxic copper and zinc ion concentrations as well as cobalt and manganese deficiencies may be among the factors controlling the growth of marine organisms in nature.

https://openalex.org/W2087863386,"Currently, Hawaii is almost totally dependent for energy on imported oil. The island state has a wide variety of renewable energy resources, however, and for the past decade has supported the development of these resources as substitutes for seaborne petroleum. Sufficient progress has been made to date in commercializing a number of these alternative energy sources to give cause for optimism tIhat Hawaii will be able to achieve energy self-sufficiency with its indigenous renewable resources."
https://openalex.org/W1980912990,"Several recently suggested Venus cloud condensates, including aluminum chloride and halides, oxides, and sulfides of arsenic and antimony, are assessed for their thermodynamic and geochemical plausibility. Aluminum chloride can confidently be ruled out, and condensation of arsenic sulfides on the surface will cause arsenic compounds to be too rare to produce the observed clouds. Antimony may be sufficiently volatile, but the expected molecular form is gaseous antimony sulfide, not the chloride. Arsenic and antimony compounds in the atmosphere will be regulated at very low levels by sulfide precipitation, irrespective of the planetary inventory of arsenic and antimony. Thus arguments for a volatile-deficient origin for Venus based on depletion of water and mercury (relative to the earth) cannot be tested by a search for atmospheric arsenic or antimony."

https://openalex.org/W2011766435,"A potential problem associated with soot particles in the atmosphere is pointed out, namely, the catalytic activity of such particles for certain atmospheric chemical reactions, including the oxidation of sulfur dioxide to sulfate. Conversion of SO/sub 2/ to sulfate is widely recognized as a major source of acidity in clouds and rain water. A significant component of atmospheric sulfate may be generated by heterogeneous reactions rather than gas phase reactions. Heterogeneous conversion of SO/sub 2/ to sulfate on soot particles was demonstrated in laboratory studies by Novakov and his co-workers in 1974. The range of other atmospherically important reactions that may also be catalyzed by carbon is not known. It seems advisable to consider the catalytic properties of soot when assessing the potential impact of increasing diesel emissions. 8 references."
