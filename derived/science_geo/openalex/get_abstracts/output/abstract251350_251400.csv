https://openalex.org/W2147238273,"Biological networks have so many possible states that exhaustive sampling is impossible. Successful analysis thus depends on simplifying hypotheses, but experiments on many systems hint that complicated, higher order interactions among large groups of elements play an important role. In the vertebrate retina, we show that weak correlations between pairs of neurons coexist with strongly collective behavior in the responses of ten or more neurons. Surprisingly, we find that this collective behavior is described quantitatively by models that capture the observed pairwise correlations but assume no higher order interactions. These maximum entropy models are equivalent to Ising models, and predict that larger networks are completely dominated by correlation effects. This suggests that the neural code has associative or error-correcting properties, and we provide preliminary evidence for such behavior. As a first test for the generality of these ideas, we show that similar results are obtained from networks of cultured cortical neurons."

Although the structures of isolated domains of Hsp90 have been determined, the arrangement and ATP-dependent dynamics of these in the full Hsp90 dimer have been elusive and contentious. Here we present the crystal structure of full-length yeast Hsp90 in complex with an ATP analogue and the co-chaperone p23/Sba1. The structure reveals the complex architecture of the 'closed' state of the Hsp90 chaperone, the extensive interactions between domains and between protein chains, the detailed conformational changes in the amino-terminal domain that accompany ATP binding, and the structural basis for stabilization of the closed state by p23/Sba1. Contrary to expectations, the closed Hsp90 would not enclose its client proteins but provides a bipartite binding surface whose formation and disruption are coupled to the chaperone ATPase cycle."
https://openalex.org/W1968593126,"There is a clear case for drug treatments to be selected according to the characteristics of an individual patient, in order to improve efficacy and reduce the number and severity of adverse drug reactions. However, such personalization of drug treatments requires the ability to predict how different individuals will respond to a particular drug/dose combination. After initial optimism, there is increasing recognition of the limitations of the pharmacogenomic approach, which does not take account of important environmental influences on drug absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion. For instance, a major factor underlying inter-individual variation in drug effects is variation in metabolic phenotype, which is influenced not only by genotype but also by environmental factors such as nutritional status, the gut microbiota, age, disease and the co- or pre-administration of other drugs. Thus, although genetic variation is clearly important, it seems unlikely that personalized drug therapy will be enabled for a wide range of major diseases using genomic knowledge alone. Here we describe an alternative and conceptually new 'pharmaco-metabonomic' approach to personalizing drug treatment, which uses a combination of pre-dose metabolite profiling and chemometrics to model and predict the responses of individual subjects. We provide proof-of-principle for this new approach, which is sensitive to both genetic and environmental influences, with a study of paracetamol (acetaminophen) administered to rats. We show pre-dose prediction of an aspect of the urinary drug metabolite profile and an association between pre-dose urinary composition and the extent of liver damage sustained after paracetamol administration."
https://openalex.org/W2164377755,"The diffuse extragalactic background light consists of the sum of the starlight emitted by galaxies through the history of the Universe, and it could also have an important contribution from the first stars, which may have formed before galaxy formation began. Direct measurements are difficult and not yet conclusive, owing to the large uncertainties caused by the bright foreground emission associated with zodiacal light. An alternative approach is to study the absorption features imprinted on the gamma-ray spectra of distant extragalactic objects by interactions of those photons with the background light photons. Here we report the discovery of gamma-ray emission from the blazars H 2356-309 and 1ES 1101-232, at redshifts z=0.165 and z=0.186, respectively. Their unexpectedly hard spectra provide an upper limit on the background light at optical/near-infrared wavelengths that appears to be very close to the lower limit given by the integrated light of resolved galaxies. The background flux at these wavelengths accordingly seems to be strongly dominated by the direct starlight from galaxies, thus excluding a large contribution from other sources -- in particular from the first stars formed. This result also indicates that intergalactic space is more transparent to gamma-rays than previously thought."

We found that plumbagin inhibited NF-κB activation induced by TNF, and other carcinogens and inflammatory stimuli (e.g. phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate, H2O2, cigarette smoke condensate, interleukin-1β, lipopolysaccharide, and okadaic acid). Plumbagin also suppressed the constitutive NF-κB activation in certain tumor cells. The suppression of NF-κB activation correlated with sequential inhibition of the tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-induced activation of IκBα kinase, IκBα phosphorylation, IκBα degradation, p65 phosphorylation, p65 nuclear translocation, and the NF-κB-dependent reporter gene expression activated by TNF, TNFR1, TRAF2, NIK, IKK-β, and the p65 subunit of NF-κB. Plumbagin also suppressed the direct binding of nuclear p65 and recombinant p65 to the DNA, and this binding was reversed by dithiothreitol both in vitro and in vivo. However, plumbagin did not inhibit p65 binding to DNA when cells were transfected with the p65 plasmid containing cysteine 38 mutated to serine. Plumbagin down-regulated the expression of NF-κB-regulated anti-apoptotic (IAP1, IAP2, Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, cFLIP, Bfl-1/A1, and survivin), proliferative (cyclin D1 and COX-2), and angiogenic (matrix metalloproteinase-9 and vascular endothelial growth factor) gene products. This led to potentiation of apoptosis induced by TNF and paclitaxel and inhibited cell invasion. Overall, our results indicate that plumbagin is a potent inhibitor of the NF-κB activation pathway that leads to suppression of NF-κB-regulated gene products. This may explain its cell growth modulatory, anticarcinogenic, and radiosensitizing effects previously described.

This may explain its cell growth modulatory, anticarcinogenic, and radiosensitizing effects previously described. Traditional medicine, although claimed to be safe and efficacious, in most cases neither the chemical entity nor the molecular mechanism of action are well defined. Plumbagin (5-hydroxy-2-methyl-1,4-naphthoquinone), a naturally occurring yellow pigment, is found in the plants of the Plumbaginaceae, Droseraceae, Ancestrocladaceae, and Dioncophyllaceae families. The root of Plumbago zeylanica (also called Chitrak), a major source of plumbagin, has been used in the Indian medicine since the period of Charaka, from 750 BC, as an antiatherogenic, cardiotonic, hepatoprotective, and neuroprotective agent (1Padhye S.B. Kulakarni B.A. J. Univ. Poona Sci. Sect. 1973; 44: 27-29Google Scholar, 2Tilak J.C. Adhikari S. Devasagayam T.P. Redox. Rep. 2004; 9: 219-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). The active principle, plumbagin, was first isolated in 1829 (3D'Astafort D. J. Pharma. Sci. 1829; 14: 441Google Scholar). Plumbagin is also present along with a series of other structurally related naphthoquinones in the roots, leaves, bark, and wood of Juglans regia (English walnut, Persian walnut, and California walnut), Juglans cinerea (butternut and white walnut), and Juglans nigra (black walnut) (4Binder R.G.

Food Chem. 1980; 28: 340-342Crossref Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Preparations derived from black walnut have been used as hair dyes and skin colorants in addition to being applied topically for the treatment of acne, inflammatory diseases, ringworm, and fungal, bacterial, and viral infections (6Inbaraj J.J. Chignell C.F. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 2004; 17: 55-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). Plumbagin has been shown to exert anticancer and antiproliferative activities in animal models as well as in cells in culture (7Hazra B. Sarkar R. Bhattacharyya S. Ghosh P.K. Chel G. Dinda B.

Cancer Lett. 1998; 127: 177-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar) have shown that plumbagin significantly inhibited azoxymethane-induced intestinal carcinogenesis in rats, suggesting its chemopreventive activity (12Sugie S. Okamoto K. Rahman K.M. Tanaka T. Kawai K. Yamahara J. Mori H. Cancer Lett. 1998; 127: 177-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Plumbagin has also been shown to induce S-G2/M cell cycle arrest through the induction of p21 (an inhibitor of cyclin-dependent kinase) (13Jaiswal A.S. Bloom L.B. Narayan S. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 5912-5922Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). A recent report showed that plumbagin has a chemotherapeutic potential as an anticancer agent in ovarian cancer cells with the mutated BRCA1 gene (14Srinivas G. Annab L.A. Gopinath G. Banerji A. Srinivas P. Mol. Carcinog. 2004; 39: 15-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The cytotoxic action of plumbagin in keratinocytes and cervical cancer cells was found to be due to a change in the redox status of the cell (6Inbaraj J.J. Chignell C.F. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 2004; 17: 55-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar, 15Srinivas P. Gopinath G. Banerji A. Dinakar A. Srinivas G. Mol. Carcinog. 2004; 40: 201-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). In embryonic kidney and brain tumor cells, plumbagin inhibited the enzyme NAD(P)H oxidase (16Ding Y. Chen Z.J. Liu S. Che D. Vetter M. Chang C.H. J. Pharm. Pharmacol. 2005; 57: 111-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar), linked with anticarcinogenic (7Hazra B. Sarkar R. Bhattacharyya S. Ghosh P.K. Chel G. Dinda B.

Rahman K.M. Tanaka T. Kawai K. Yamahara J. Mori H. Cancer Lett. 1998; 127: 177-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar) and atherosclerotic effects (17Sharma I. Gusain D. Dixit V.P. Indian J. Physiol. Pharmacol. 1991; 35: 10-14PubMed Google Scholar). Besides anticancer effects, plumbagin also exhibited radiosensitizing properties in experimental mouse tumors as well as in tumor cells in vitro (18Devi P.U. Rao B.S. Solomon F.E. Indian J. Exp. Biol. 1998; 36: 891-895PubMed Google Scholar, 19Ganasoundari A. Zare S.M. Devi P.U. Br. J. Radiol. 1997; 70: 599-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 20Prasad V.S. Devi P.U. Rao B.S. Kamath R. Indian J. Exp. Biol. 1996; 34: 857-858PubMed Google Scholar). Elucidation of the mechanism(s) by which plumbagin induces its anticarcinogenic, antiproliferative, and radiosensitizing activities is necessary to provide a solid foundation for its use as an agent for prevention strategies. We postulated that plumbagin mediates its various activities through suppression of the transcription factor nuclear factor-κB(NF-κB), 2The abbreviations used are: NF-κB, nuclear factor-κB; IκB, inhibitory subunit of NF-κB; IKK, IκBα kinase; SEAP, secretory alkaline phosphatase; TUNEL, terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated deoxyuridine triphosphate nick end-labeling; FLIP, FLICE-inhibitory protein; COX, cyclooxygenase; MMP, matrix metalloproteinase; TRAF, tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor; TNF, tumor necrosis factor; DTT, dithiothreitol; IAP, anti-inhibitor of apoptosis protein; PARP, poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase; VEGF, vascular endothelial growth factor; MTT, 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay; AP-1, activator protein-1; STAT, signal transducer and activator of transcription 3; NIK, NF-κB-inducing kinase; TNFR1, tumor necrosis factor receptor 1; ROS, reactive oxygen species. 2The abbreviations used are: NF-κB, nuclear factor-κB; IκB, inhibitory subunit of NF-κB; IKK, IκBα kinase; SEAP, secretory alkaline phosphatase; TUNEL, terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated deoxyuridine triphosphate nick end-labeling; FLIP, FLICE-inhibitory protein; COX, cyclooxygenase; MMP, matrix metalloproteinase; TRAF, tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor; TNF, tumor necrosis factor; DTT, dithiothreitol; IAP, anti-inhibitor of apoptosis protein; PARP, poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase; VEGF, vascular endothelial growth factor; MTT, 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay; AP-1, activator protein-1; STAT, signal transducer and activator of transcription 3; NIK, NF-κB-inducing kinase; TNFR1, tumor necrosis factor receptor 1; ROS, reactive oxygen species. for the following reasons. First, various carcinogens and tumor promoters have been shown to activate NF-κB; second, constitutive expression of NF-κB is frequently found in tumor cells; third, NF-κB activation induces resistance to chemotherapeutic agents and to radiation; fourth, several genes involved in tumor initiation, promotion, and metastasis are regulated by NF-κB. Fifth, activation of NF-κB suppresses apoptosis and promotes proliferation. Hence, agents that can down-regulate NF-κB activation, therefore, have potential in the prevention of cancer (21Aggarwal B.B. Cancer Cell. 2004; 6: 203-208Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1363) Google Scholar). Under normal conditions, NF-κB is present in the cytoplasm as an inactive heterotrimer consisting of three subunits: p50, p65, and IκBα. Upon activation, IκBα undergoes phosphorylation and ubiquitination-dependent degradation by the 26 S proteasome, thus exposing nuclear localization signals on the p50-p65 heterodimer, leading to nuclear translocation and binding to a specific consensus sequence in the DNA, 5′-GGGACTTTC-3′ (22Ghosh S. May M.J. Kopp E.B. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1998; 16: 225-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (4584) Google Scholar). The binding activates NF-κB gene expression, which in turn results in transcription of the NF-κB-regulated genes (21Aggarwal B.B. Cancer Cell. 2004; 6: 203-208Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1363) Google Scholar). The phosphorylation of IκBα is mediated through the activation of the IκBα kinase (IKK) complex (23Ducut Sigala J.L. Bottero V. Young D.B. Shevchenko A. Mercurio F. Verma I.M. Science. 2004; 304: 1963-1967Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). Because plumbagin has been reported to exhibit chemopreventive, growth inhibitory, and radiosensitizing effects, we postulated that this quinone may be mediating its effects through modulation of the NF-κB activation pathway. To test this hypothesis, we investigated the effect of plumbagin on NF-κB activation induced by several inflammatory agents in various cell types, including those in which NF-κB is constitutively active. We found that plumbagin inhibited NF-κB activation and NF-κB-regulated gene products, leading to an increase in apoptosis and suppression of cellular invasion. Reagents—Plumbagin and its analogues (with purity greater than 97%) were purchased from Sigma. A 100 mm solution of plumbagin was prepared in dimethyl sulfoxide, stored as small aliquots at –20 °C, and then diluted as needed in cell culture medium.

Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay—To determine NF-κB activation, we performed electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA) as described previously (25Takada Y. Khuri F.R. Aggarwal B.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 26287-26299Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). The specificity of binding was also examined by competition with the unlabeled oligonucleotide. For supershift assays, nuclear extracts prepared from TNF-treated cells were incubated with antibodies against either p50 or p65 of NF-κB for 15 min at 37 °C before the complex was analyzed by EMSA. The dried gels were visualized, and radioactive bands were quantified by a PhosphorImager, Storm 820 (Amersham Biosciences), using ImageQuant software.

Meyer D.J. Campbell G.S. Larner A.C. Carter-Su C. Schwartz J. Jove R. Science. 1995; 269: 81-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (819) Google Scholar). Briefly, U266 cells were incubated with different concentrations of plumbagin. Nuclear extracts were prepared and labeled with high affinity cis-inducible element probe (5′-CTTCATTTCCCGTAAATCCCTAAAGCT-3′ and 5′-AGCTTTAGGGATTTACGGGAAATGA-3′), and STAT3-DNA binding was resolved from free oligonucleotide on 5% native polyacrylamide gels. Transfection—A293 cells (5 × 105 cells/well) were plated in 6-well plates and transiently transfected by FuGENE 6 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) with pcDNA3.1 or pcDNA expression vectors for mouse p65 or mouse p65C38S for 48 h (28Liang M.C.

Thereafter, we prepared the nuclear extracts from transfected cells, then incubated the extracts with plumbagin for 30 min and measured the DNA binding by EMSA. Western Blot Analysis—To determine the levels of protein expression in the cytoplasm or nucleus, we prepared extracts (29Takada Y. Aggarwal B.B. J.

Singh S. Aggarwal B.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 24233-24241Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar). Immunocytochemistry for NF-κB p65 Localization—The effect of plumbagin on the nuclear translocation of p65 was examined by immunocytochemistry as described previously (31Takada Y. Aggarwal B.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 4750-4759Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). NF-κB-dependent Reporter Gene Expression Assay—NF-κB-dependent reporter gene expression was performed as described (31Takada Y. Aggarwal B.B. J. Biol.

Annexin V Assay—An early indicator of apoptosis is the rapid translocation and accumulation of the membrane phospholipid phosphatidylserine from the cytoplasmic interface to the extracellular surface. This loss of membrane asymmetry can be detected by utilizing the binding properties of annexin V. This assay was performed as indicated previously (32Bharti A.C. Takada Y. Shishodia S. Aggarwal B.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 6065-6076Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). TUNEL Assay—We also assayed cytotoxicity by the terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated deoxyuridine triphosphate nick end-labeling (TUNEL) method, which examines DNA strand breaks during apoptosis, using an in situ cell death detection reagent (Roche Diagnostics). This assay was performed as indicated previously (25Takada Y. Khuri F.R. Aggarwal B.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 26287-26299Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Cytotoxicity Assay—The effect of plumbagin on the cytotoxic effects of TNF and chemotherapeutic agents was determined by the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) uptake method as described (33Shishodia S. Majumdar S. Banerjee S. Aggarwal B.B. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 4375-4383PubMed Google Scholar). Invasion Assay—Invasion through the extracellular matrix is a crucial step in tumor metastasis. The BD BioCoat tumor invasion system that we used has a chamber with a light-tight polyethylene terephthalate membrane with 8-μm pores coated with a reconstituted basement membrane gel (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA). This assay was performed as indicated previously (34Ichikawa H. Takada Y. Murakami A. Aggarwal B.B. J. Immunol. 2005; 174: 7383-7392Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of plumbagin on the transcription factor NF-κB-signaling pathway and NF-κB-regulated gene products. Most of the studies were carried out using human chronic myeloid leukemia (KBM-5) cells. We used TNF to examine the effect of plumbagin on the NF-κB activation pathway because the pathway activated by this agent is well understood. Under the conditions that we used to examine the NF-κB pathway and NF-κB-regulated gene products, plumbagin had no effect on cell viability. Plumbagin Suppresses TNF-induced NF-κB Activation—To determine the effect of plumbagin on TNF-induced NF-κB activation, cells either untreated or treated with plumbagin (5 μm for 4 h) were exposed to 0.1 nm TNF for different times; nuclear extracts were then prepared and examined for NF-κB activation by DNA-binding assays. TNF activated NF-κB in a time-dependent manner in the untreated cells (Fig. 1A, left panel); however, in plumbagin-treated cells, NF-κB activation was significantly inhibited (Fig. 1A, right panel). To further determine the optimum time of exposure to plumbagin to suppress NF-κB activation, cells were treated with plumbagin (5 μm) for different times and then left untreated or activated with 0.1 nm TNF for 30 min. We found that plumbagin alone did not significantly activate NF-κB (Fig. 1B, left panel), but the TNF-induced NF-κB activation was inhibited in a time-dependent manner (Fig. 1B, right panel). Four hours was sufficient to significantly suppress TNF-induced NF-κB activation. To determine the optimum dose of plumbagin required to suppress NF-κB activation, cells were treated with different concentrations of plumbagin for 4 h and then either left untreated or activated with 0.1 nm TNF for 30 min. We found that plumbagin alone had no effect (Fig. 1C, left panel), but the TNF-induced NF-κB activation was inhibited in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 1C, right panel). Five micromolar plumbagin was sufficient to suppress TNF-induced NF-κB activation significantly. To determine the effect of plumbagin on NF-κB activation at a high TNF concentration, KBM-5 cells were pretreated with plumbagin, and then TNF was added up to 1,000 pm and analyzed for NF-κB activation by EMSA (Fig. 1D). TNF at a concentration of 1 nm strongly activated NF-κB activity; however, pretreatment with plumbagin markedly inhibited this activation. These results show that plumbagin is a potent inhibitor of TNF-induced NF-κB activation. When nuclear extracts from TNF-activated cells were incubated with antibodies to the p50 (NF-κB1) and p65 (RelA) subunit of NF-κB, the resulting bands were shifted to higher molecular masses, suggesting that the TNF-activated complex consisted of p50 and p65. Preimmune serum had no effect on DNA binding. The addition of excess unlabeled NF-κB (cold oligonucleotide, 100-fold) caused a complete disappearance of the band, whereas mutated oligonucleotide had no effect on DNA binding (Fig. 1E). Plumbagin Is a Specific Inhibitor of Transcription Factor NF-κB—Whether plumbagin suppresses other transcription factors like AP-1 and STAT3 under the conditions it suppresses NF-κB, was examined. The results show that pretreatment with plumbagin inhibited neither TNF-induced AP-1 activity in KBM-5 cells (Fig. 1F), nor constitutive STAT3 activation in U266 cells (Fig. 1G). Inhibition of NF-κB Activation by Plumbagin Was Not Cell-type Specific—Different cell types mediate NF-κB induction by distinct signal transduction pathways (35Bonizzi G. Piette J. Merville M.P. Bours V. J. Immunol. 1997; 159: 5264-5272PubMed Google Scholar, 36Ghosh S. Karin M. Cell. 2002; 109: S81-S96Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3280) Google Scholar). Besides myeloid KBM-5 cells, whether plumbagin suppresses NF-κB activation in other myeloid cells was examined. As shown in Fig. 2A, plumbagin also suppressed the TNF-induced NF-κB activation in human histiocytic lymphoma myeloid U937 cells. We also examined the ability of plumbagin to suppress NF-κB activation in human epithelial lung adenocarcinoma H1299 cells. As shown in Fig. 2B, plumbagin also suppressed the TNF-induced NF-κB activation in these cells. Plumbagin alone did not activate NF-κB. Besides inducible, whether plumbagin could suppress constitutive NF-κB activation was also examined by EMSA. Human multiple myeloma U266 cells and human squamous cell carcinoma SCC-4 cells are known to express constitutively active NF-κB (21Aggarwal B.B. Cancer Cell. 2004; 6: 203-208Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1363) Google Scholar). Treatment of these cells with different concentrations of plumbagin suppressed constitutive NF-κB activation (Fig. 2, C and D, respectively). Plumbagin Blocked NF-κB Activation Induced by Different Activators—Interleukin-1β, okadaic acid, lipopolysaccharide, H2O2, phorbol myristate acetate, and cigarette smoke condensate are potent activators of NF-κB, but the pathways by which these agents activate NF-κB differ (24Anto R.J. Mukhopadhyay A. Shishodia S. Gairola C.G. Aggarwal B.B. Carcinogenesis. 2002; 23: 1511-1518Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 30Takada Y. Mukhopadhyay A. Kundu G.C. Mahabeleshwar G.H. Singh S.

The effect of plumbagin on the activation of NF-κB by these agents was examined by EMSA. Pretreatment of KBM-5 cells with plumbagin completely suppressed the activation of NF-κB induced by all agents (Fig. 2E). These results clearly suggest that plumbagin acts at a step in the NF-κB activation pathway that must be common to all the agents. Plumbagin Directly Interferes with the Binding of NF-κB to the DNA—Results from our laboratory and others have shown that certain NF-κB inhibitors suppress NF-κB activation by directly blocking the binding of NF-κB to the DNA (39Finco T.S.

When we incubated nuclear extracts from TNF-treated cells with plumbagin, the EMSA results showed that it significantly inhibited NF-κB binding to the DNA (Fig. 3A). It is possible that plumbagin inhibits the binding of NF-κB to the DNA through modification of NF-κB proteins. We have shown that suppression of NF-κB activation by caffeic acid phenethyl ester can be reversed by reducing agents (41Natarajan K."

EGCG seems to accomplish this by modulating amyloid precursor protein (APP) processing, resulting in enhanced cleavage of the α-COOH-terminal fragment (α-CTF) of APP and corresponding elevation of the NH2-terminal APP product, soluble APP-α (sAPP-α). These beneficial effects were associated with increased α-secretase cleavage activity, but no significant alteration in β-or γ-secretase activities. To gain insight into the molecular mechanism whereby EGCG modulates APP processing, we evaluated the involvement of three candidateα-secretase enzymes, a-disintegrin and metalloprotease (ADAM) 9, 10, or 17, in EGCG-induced non-amyloidogenic APP metabolism. Results show that EGCG treatment of N2a cells stably transfected with “Swedish” mutant human APP (SweAPP N2a cells) leads to markedly elevated active (∼60 kDa mature form) ADAM10 protein. Elevation of active ADAM10 correlates with increased α-CTF cleavage, and elevated sAPP-α. To specifically test the contribution of ADAM10 to non-amyloidogenic APP metabolism, small interfering RNA knockdown of ADAM9, -10, or -17 mRNA was employed. Results show that ADAM10 (but not ADAM9 or -17) is critical for EGCG-mediated α-secretase cleavage activity. In summary, ADAM10 activation is necessary for EGCG promotion of non-amyloidogenic (α-secretase cleavage) APP processing.

Aβ peptides from 40–42 amino acids in length are constituents of senile plaques in AD brain and exhibit direct or indirect neurotoxic effects (5Pereira C. Agostinho P. Moreira P.I. Cardoso S.M. Oliveira C.R. Curr. Drug Targets CNS Neurol. Disord. 2005; 4: 383-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Processing of APP is accomplished by enzymes known as secretases. Whereas non-amyloidogenic α-secretase cleavage produces the amino-terminal product named soluble APPα (sAPP-α) and the carboxyl-terminal fragment (CTF) α-CTF (also known as C83), the action of amyloidogenic β-secretase on APP results in the amino-terminal product sAPP-β and the carboxyl-terminal product β-CTF (also known as C99). Subsequent γ-secretase complex cleavage of β-CTF yields γ-CTF (also known as C57), and releases Aβ (6De Strooper B. Saftig P. Craessaerts K. Vanderstichele H. Guhde G. Annaert W. Von Figura K.

Commun. 2003; 301: 231-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar) reported that ADAM9, -10, and -17 all have roles in the processing of APP to sAPP-α in vitro. In cerebrospinal fluid from AD patients, ADAM10 and corresponding sAPP/α-CTFs are decreased (21Colciaghi F. Borroni B. Pastorino L. Marcello E. Zimmermann M. Cattabeni F. Padovani A. Di Luca M. Mol.

Neurology. 2004; 62: 498-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Moreover, ADAM10 is also decreased in AD and Down syndrome brains (23Bernstein H.G. Bukowska A. Krell D. Bogerts B. Ansorge S. Lendeckel U. J. Neurocytol. 2003; 32: 153-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). A report by Lopez-Perez and colleagues (24Lopez-Perez E. Zhang Y. Frank S.J. Creemers J. Seidah N. Checler F. J. Neurochem. 2001; 76: 1532-1539Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar) implicates ADAM10 as a contributor to constitutive sAPP-α production, whereas ADAM17 (also known as tumor necrosis factor-α converting enzyme, TACE) is implicated in a regulated mechanism of sAPP-α production (24Lopez-Perez E. Zhang Y. Frank S.J. Creemers J. Seidah N. Checler F. J. Neurochem. 2001; 76: 1532-1539Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Recently, Postina and colleagues (25Postina R. Schroeder A. Dewachter I. Bohl J. Schmitt U. Kojro E. Prinzen C. Endres K. Hiemke C. Blessing M. Flamez P. Dequenne A. Godaux E. van Leuven F. Fahrenholz F. J. Clin. Investig. 2004; 113: 1456-1464Crossref PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar) showed that activation of α-secretase significantly reduces AD-like pathology in an animal model of AD. Although individual contributions by putative α-secretases to the AD process still remain unclear, the above mentioned study in mice raises the possibility that a strategy of increasing α-secretase activity may provide a promising therapeutic target for AD.Much research has focused on the therapeutic potential of compounds that may promote non-amyloidogenic processing of APP (26Vardy E.R. Catto A.J. Hooper N.M. Trends Mol. Med. 2005; 11: 464-472Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). One such compound, a polyphenol flavonoid known as (–)-epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG), is found in green tea and is known to enhance the processing of APP to sAPP-α in vitro (27Levites Y. Amit T. Youdim M.B. Mandel S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 30574-30580Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar, 28Levites Y. Amit T. Mandel S. Youdim M.B. FASEB J. 2003; 17: 952-954Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We recently demonstrated that EGCG enhances metabolism of APP to sAPP-α, and reduces Aβ levels both in vitro in neuron-like cells and in vivo in the “Swedish” APP transgenic (Tg2576) mouse model of AD (29Rezai-Zadeh K. Shytle D. Sun N. Mori T. Hou H. Jeanniton D. Ehrhart J. Townsend K. Zeng J. Morgan D. Hardy J. Town T. Tan J. J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 8807-8814Crossref PubMed Scopus (573) Google Scholar). To discern the mechanism whereby EGCG promotes non-amyloidogenic APP processing, we have performed Western analysis of ADAM9, -10, and -17 in murine neuron-like N2a cells stably transfected with the Swedish APP mutation (SweAPP N2a). Data show that EGCG treatment results in a dose-dependent increase in the mature form (∼60 kDa) of ADAM10, whereas no significant change in ADAM9 or -17 was observed. Small interfering RNA (siRNA) knockdown of ADAM9, -10, or -17 in SweAPP N2a cells reveals the specific requirement of ADAM10 in EGCG-induced modulation of APP metabolism toward the non-amyloidogenic pathway. Both SweAPP N2a cells and primary cultures of neurons from Tg2576 mice show enhanced levels of sAPP-α and mature ADAM10 in response to EGCG treatment. When taken together, these results indicate that ADAM10 is a key effector in EGCG promotion of non-amyloidogenic APP proteolysis. These data provide important mechanistic insight into the potential use of EGCG and/or other stimulators of ADAM10 as therapeutics to oppose cerebral amyloidosis associated with AD.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESReagents—Green tea-derived EGCG (95% purity by high performance liquid chromatography) was purchased from Sigma. Polyclonal antibodies against ADAM10 were obtained from Calbiochem. ADAM17 (TACE) and ADAM9 antibodies were obtained from Sigma. Polyclonal antibody against the carboxyl terminus of APP (369 antibody) was kindly provided by S. Gandy and H. Steiner. Monoclonal antibodies against the amino terminus of APP (22C11) and against actin were purchased from Roche. Anti-Aβ1–17 monoclonal antibody (6E10) and biotinylated anti-Aβ17–26 monoclonal antibody (4G8) were obtained from Signet Laboratories (Dedham, MA).ELISA—Conditioned media were collected and analyzed at a 1:1 dilution using the method as previously described (30Tan J. Town T. Crawford F. Mori T. DelleDonne A. Crescentini R. Obregon D. Flavell R.A. Mullan M.J. Nat. Neurosci. 2002; 5: 1288-1293Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar) and values were reported as percentage of Aβ1–x secreted relative to control. Quantitation of total Aβ species was performed according to published methods (31Marambaud P. Zhao H. Davies P. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 45: 37377-37382Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (650) Google Scholar). Briefly, 6E10 (capture antibody) was coated at 2 μg/ml in PBS into 96-well immunoassay plates overnight at 4 °C. The plates were washed with 0.05% Tween 20 in PBS five times and blocked with blocking buffer (PBS with 1% bovine serum albumin, 5% horse serum) for 2 h at room temperature. Conditioned medium or Aβ standards were added to the plates and incubated overnight at 4 °C. Following 3 washes, biotinylated antibody, 4G8 (0.5 μg/ml in PBS with 1% bovine serum albumin), was added to the plates and incubated for 2 h at room temperature. After 5 washes, streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase (1:200 dilutions in PBS with 1% bovine serum albumin) was added to the 96-well plates for 30 min at room temperature. Tetramethylbenzidine substrate was added to the plates and incubated for 15 min at room temperature. 50 μl of stop solution (2 n H2SO4) was added to each well of the plates. The optical density of each well was immediately determined by a microplate reader at 450 nm. In addition, Aβ1–40, or Aβ1–42 was separately quantified in these samples using the Aβ1–40 or Aβ1–42 ELISA kits (IBL-America, Minneapolis, MN) in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions. In all cases, Aβ levels were expressed as a percentage of control (conditioned medium from untreated SweAPP N2a cells).Western Blot—Cultured cells were lysed in ice-cold lysis buffer as described above, and an aliquot corresponding to 50 μg of total protein was electrophoretically separated using 16.5% Tris-Tricine gels. Electrophoresed proteins were then transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Bio-Rad), washed in ddH2O, and blocked for 1 h at ambient temperature in Tris-buffered saline (TBS; Bio-Rad) containing 5% (w/v) nonfat dry milk. After blocking, membranes were hybridized for 1 h at ambient temperature with various primary antibodies. Membranes were then washed 3 times for 5 min each in ddH2O and incubated for 1 h at ambient temperature with the appropriate horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (1:1,000, Pierce Biotechnology). All antibodies were diluted in TBS containing 5% (w/v) nonfat dry milk. Blots were developed using the luminol reagent (Pierce Biotechnology). Densitometric analysis was done using the Fluor-S MultiImager™ with Quantity One™ software (Bio-Rad). For examining sAPP-α, conditioned medium was collected following treatment according to a modified protocol from Chen and Fernandez (32Chen M. Fernandez H.L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2004; 316: 332-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). sAPP-α was extracted using 3K Nanosep centrifugal filters (Pall Life Sciences, Ann Arbor, MI) and protein concentrate was prepared for the aforementioned electrophoresis. Antibodies used for Western blot included: antibody 369 (which recognizes the carboxyl terminus of APP; 1:1,500), clone 22C11 (against the amino terminus of APP; 1:1,500), clone 6E10 (against amino acids 1–17 of Aβ; 1:1,500), anti-ADAM9 (1:500), and antibodies against ADAM10 (1:500), ADAM17 (1:500), or actin (1:1,500; as an internal reference control).To characterize α-CTF detected by antibody 369 in this study, we performed an additional experiment. The blots were first hybridized with an antibody (369) specifically against the carboxyl terminus of APP, were put in stripping solution (62.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, and 100 mm β-mercaptoethanol) and incubated at 50 °C for 30 min in a sealed plastic container in a shaking water bath. After stripping, blots were rinsed with TBST (TBS + 0.1% Tween 20) and re-blocked with TBSTM (TBST + 5% nonfat dry milk), and then re-probed with an antibody that recognizes Aβ1–17 (6E10). Alternatively, membranes with identical samples were probed either with antibody 369 or with antibody 6E10. As expected, the ∼11-kDa band was positive for both 369 and 6E10 antibodies probings, thereby confirming its identity as an α-CTF.Primary Cultures—Breeding pairs of C57BL/6 mice were purchased from the Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME). Tg2576 mice were provided by the University of South Florida. Primary culture microglial cells were isolated from mouse cerebral cortices and were grown in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 5% fetal calf serum, 2 mm glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, 0.1 μg/ml streptomycin, and 0.05 mm 2-mercaptoethanol according to previously described methods (32Chen M. Fernandez H.L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2004; 316: 332-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 33Chao C.C. Hu S. Close K. Choi C.S. Molitor T.W. Novick W.J. Peterson P.K. J. Infect. Dis. 1992; 166: 847-853Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Briefly, cerebral cortices from newborn mice (1–2 days old) were isolated under sterile conditions and kept in 75-cm2 flasks, and complete medium was added. Primary cultures were kept for 14 days so that only glial cells remained, and microglial cells were isolated by shaking flasks at 200 rpm at 37 °C in a Lab-Line incubator shaker. More that 98% of these glial cells stained positive for MAC-1 (CD11b/CD18; Roche) confirming their identity as microglia. Mouse primary culture neuronal cells were prepared as previously described (32Chen M. Fernandez H.L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2004; 316: 332-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 34Tan J. Town T. Mori T. Wu Y. Saxe M. Crawford F. Mullan M. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 7587-7594Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, cerebral cortices were isolated from Tg2576 mouse embryos, between 15 and 17 days in utero, and were mechanically dissociated in trypsin (0.25%) individually after incubation for 15 min at 37 °C. Cells were collected after centrifugation at 1,200 × g, resuspended in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 10% horse serum, uridine (33.6 μg/ml; Sigma), and fluorodeoxyuridine (13.6 μg/ml; Sigma), and seeded in 24-well collagen-coated culture plates at 2.5 × 105 cells per well. When neuronal cells were isolated from Tg2576 mice, to verify the presence of the transgene, PCR genotype analysis was performed as previously described (30Tan J. Town T. Crawford F. Mori T. DelleDonne A. Crescentini R. Obregon D. Flavell R.A. Mullan M.J. Nat. Neurosci. 2002; 5: 1288-1293Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar) and the human APPsw transgene was detected in these cells (data not shown).Small Interfering RNA-mediated Gene Silencing—SweAPP N2a cells were transfected with siRNA pre-designed to knockdown murine ADAM9, -10, or -17 mRNA (Dharmacon Inc., Lafayette, CO). SweAPP N2a cells were seeded in 24-well plates and cultured until they reached 70% confluence. The cells were then transfected with 50–200 nm anti-ADAM9, -10, or -17 siRNA or anti-green fluorescent protein (non-targeting control; Dharmacon) using Code-Breaker transfection reagent (Promega) and cultured for an additional 18 h in serum-free minimal essential medium. Transfection efficiency was determined to be greater than 80% (data not shown) using no-RISC siGLOW (fluorescently labeled non-functional siRNA; Dharmacon). The cells were allowed to recover for 24 h in complete medium (minimal essential medium, 10% fetal bovine serum) before treatment. The cells were evaluated by Western blot analysis for expression of ADAM9, -10, or -17.RT-PCR—Analysis of murine ADAM10 was conducted according to previously published methods (35Ehrhart J. Obregon D. Mori T. Hou H. Sun N. Bai Y. Klein T. Fernandez F. Tan J. Shytle R.D. J. Neuroinflammation. 2005; 2: 29-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar, 36Park J.W. Choi Y.J. Suh S.I. Kwon T.K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 286: 721-725Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Briefly, total RNA was isolated from SweAPP N2a cells and subjected to reverse transcription utilizing a commercially available kit (cDNA Cycle® kit; Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions on a Bio-Rad iCycler thermocycler. The same machine was used to amplify murine cDNA by PCR using ADAM10 sense (5′-GCCAGCCTATCTGTGGAAACGGG-3′) and antisense (5′-TTAGCGTCGCATGTGTCCCATTTG-3′) primers or γ-actin sense (5′-TTGAGACCTTCAACACCC-3′) and antisense (5′-GCAGCTCATAGCTCTTCT-3′) primers (0.5 μg/25 μl final reaction volume) using a commercially available kit (HotStarTaq Master Mix; Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Thermocycler conditions consisted of an initial denaturing step at 95 °C for 15 min, followed by 35 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s, 50 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 1 min, and a final extension step at 72 °C for 10 min. Resolution and analysis of PCR product (murine ADAM10: 881 bp, murine γ-actin: 357 bp) band densities were conducted by ethidium bromide-stained agarose gel electrophoresis and identified using UV transillumination by comparisons with molecular weight markers (Invitrogen). Samples that were not subjected to reverse transcription were run in parallel as negative controls to rule out DNA contamination as a template for PCR products (data not shown). A “no template control” was also included for each primer set as a further negative control (data not shown). Amplification of γ-actin was used to normalize for input cDNA.Statistical Analysis—All data were normally distributed; therefore, in instances of single mean comparisons, Levene's test for equality of variances followed by t test for independent samples was used to assess significance. In instances of multiple mean comparisons, analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used, followed by post hoc comparison using Bonferonni's method. α Levels were set at 0.05 for all analyses. The statistical package for the social sciences release 10.0.5 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL) was used for all data analysis.RESULTSEGCG Treatment Enhances ADAM10 Activation in Cultured CNS Cells—To determine whether EGCG modulates expression of candidate α-secretases ADAM9, -10, or -17, we treated N2a cells stably transfected with Swedish mutant APP (SweAPP N2a cells) with various doses of EGCG and measured the respective levels of protein expression. Mature ADAM10 (the ∼60-kDa isoform), but not ADAM9 or ADAM17, dose dependently increased in response to EGCG treatment (Fig. 1A). To investigate if EGCG treatment might affect mRNA expression of ADAM10 across the time frame examined above, we isolated total RNA from cells treated in parallel for RT-PCR analysis. Results show no significant between EGCG dose differences on ADAM10 mRNA levels (Fig. 1B). Temporal analysis of the effect of EGCG on ADAMs expression showed significant increases in mature ADAM10 as early as 30 min after treatment with 20 μm EGCG (Fig. 1C), an effect that continued to increase through to 120 min after EGCG challenge. However, no significant effects of EGCG treatment on ADAM9 or -17 were noted (data not shown). Consistent with these findings, EGCG also dose dependently increased ADAM10 maturation in two additional cell types, parental (non-transfected) N2a cells and N9 microglial cells. Relative to N9 microglia, the neuron-like parental N2a cell line demonstrated increased sensitivity to EGCG treatment (Fig. 2A). Similar to N2a and N9 cell lines, primary murine neuronal and microglial cultures also displayed dose-dependent increases in mature ADAM10 in response to EGCG treatment (Fig. 2B), with primary neurons showing increased sensitivity to the lower doses (10 and 20 μm) of EGCG.FIGURE 2EGCG treatment enhances ADAM10 in both cultured neuronal and microglial cells. A and B, cell lysates were prepared from N2a cells or N9 microglial cells (A) or wild-type mouse-derived primary neuronal or microglial cells (B) that were treated with EGCG at various doses as indicated for 8 h and subjected to Western blot for ADAM10 cleavage analysis. Densitometry analysis shows the band density ratio of mADAM10 to pro-ADAM10 as indicated below. One-way ANOVA followed by post hoc analysis revealed significant differences between N2a and N9 cells treated with EGCG at 10 and 20 μm (**, p < 0.001), and primary neuronal and microglial cells treated with EGCG at 10 and 20 μm (**, p < 0.001). Similar results were obtained in two independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)EGCG-induced Maturation of ADAM10 Correlates with APP α-Secretase Cleavage—To determine whether the EGCG-mediated dose-dependent increase in mature ADAM10 might result in modulation of APP processing, we subjected SweAPP N2a cells to various doses of EGCG and then analyzed APP metabolism and ADAM10 maturation in parallel. Western analysis revealed dose-dependent increases in α-CTF and sAPP-α with corresponding increases in mature ADAM10 in response to EGCG treatment (Fig. 3, A–C). Moreover, we also observed EGCG dose-dependent reductions in Aβ1–40 and Aβ1–42 concentrations after EGCG treatment by Aβ ELISA (Fig. 3D), further confirming that 1) EGCG promotes non-amyloidogenic APP processing and 2) that this effect correlates with increased ADAM10 maturation. Accordingly, primary neuronal cells derived from Tg2576 mice were also analyzed for changes in APP metabolism in response to EGCG treatment. Western analysis revealed EGCG promotion of the APP α-secretase cleavage pathway, as quantified by the ratio of α-CTF to holo-APP (Fig. 3E). Similar to data observed in SweAPP N2a cells, APP α-CTF cleavage positively correlated with mature ADAM10 levels (Fig. 3F) and with secreted sAPP-α (Fig. 3G) in these cells. Importantly, we also observed dose-dependent reductions in Aβ1–40 and Aβ1–42 levels following EGCG treatment of primary neurons from Tg2576 mice (Fig. 3H).FIGURE 3EGCG-induced ADAM10 activation correlates with APP α-secretase cleavage in vitro. SweAPP N2a cells (A and B) or Tg2576 mouse-derived primary neuronal cells (E and F) were treated with EGCG at various doses for 8 h and subjected to Western blot for APP CTFs and ADAM10. As indicated in panels to the right, densitometry analysis shows the band density ratio of α-CTF to full-length APP (holo-APP) for A and E or mADAM10 to pro-ADAM10 for B and F. One-way ANOVA revealed significant EGCG dose differences on both ratios of α-CTF to holo-APP and mADAM10 to pro-ADAM10 (**, p < 0.001). Conditioned media were collected from SweAPP N2a cells (C and D) or Tg2576 mouse-derived primary neuronal cells (G and H) after EGCG treatment and subjected to Western blot for sAPP-α or Aβ ELISA. Data are represented as % change relative to control (medium from cultured SweAPP N2a cells or primary neuronal cells without any treatment). One-way ANOVA revealed significant EGCG dose differences in both ratios of sAPP-α to actin (**, p < 0.001) and reduction of Aβ1–40 and Aβ1–42 (*, p < 0.05; **, p < 0.001). Similar results were observed in three independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image"

However, the mechanism of aggregation is currently not well understood. Ataxin-3 consists of a folded Josephin domain followed by two ubiquitin-interacting motifs and a C-terminal polyglutamine tract, which in the non-pathological form is less than 45 residues in length. We demonstrate that ataxin-3 with 64 glutamines (at(Q64)) undergoes a two-stage aggregation. The first stage involves formation of SDS-soluble aggregates, and the second stage results in formation of SDS-insoluble aggregates via the poly(Q) region. Both these first and second stage aggregates display typical amyloid-like characteristics. Under the same conditions at(Q15) and at(QHQ) undergo a single step aggregation event resulting in SDS-soluble aggregates, which does not involve the polyglutamine tract. These aggregates do not convert to the SDS-insoluble form. These observations demonstrate that ataxin-3 has an inherent capacity to aggregate through its non-polyglutamine domains. However, the presence of a pathological length polyglutamine tract introduces an additional step resulting in formation of a highly stable amyloid-like aggregate.

Expansion of the poly(Q) tract beyond 45 residues causes spinocerebellar ataxia type 3 (SCA3) also known as Machado-Joseph disease (9Kawaguchi Y. Okamoto T. Taniwaki M. Aizawa M. Inoue M. Katayama S.

Genet. 2005; 133B: 124-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Similar dynamic expansion of poly(Q) tracts within various other proteins causes a further eight autosomally dominant neurodegenerative diseases, collectively termed poly(Q) diseases (2Zoghbi H.Y. Orr H.T. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2000; 23: 217-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (1103) Google Scholar, 11Margolis R.L. Ross C.A. Trends Mol. Med. 2001; 7: 479-482Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Several key observations have led to the conclusion that poly(Q) diseases originate via a toxic gain of function, mediated by poly(Q) tract expansion. Firstly, the manifestation of each poly(Q) disease is directly reliant on a threshold length of consecutive glutamine residues. In all of the diseases, except for SCA6, this threshold is remarkably similar with a tract length in excess of 40 residues associated with disease onset (2Zoghbi H.Y. Orr H.T. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2000; 23: 217-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (1103) Google Scholar). Secondly, there is a non-linear correlation between an increasing glutamine tract length and an earlier age of disease onset (12Wanker E.E. Biol. Chem. 2000; 381: 937-942Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Thirdly, different proteins involved in each of the various poly(Q) diseases share no sequence homology except the presence of the glutamine tract (13Ross C.A. Poirier M.A. Wanker E.E. Amzel M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 1-3Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Various studies have suggested that this toxic gain of function is causally linked to aberrant protein aggregation mediated by the extended poly(Q) tract (14Kakizuka A. Trends Genet. 1998; 14: 396-402Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). In vitro studies have shown that poly(Q) peptides, fragments, and proteins can form amyloid-like fibrillar aggregates and that the aggregation rate increases with increasing glutamine tract length (15Chen S.

Various types of intraneuronal aggregates, including nuclear inclusions, of the poly(Q) protein in question are also evident upon post-mortem analysis (20Paulson H.L. Perez M.K. Trottier Y.

Science. 1997; 277: 1990-1993Crossref PubMed Scopus (2322) Google Scholar). These observations, among others, suggest that poly(Q) diseases are conformational diseases, in which toxicity is linked to the ability of the protein to self-associate and form aggregates (23Chow M.K.

We and others have demonstrated that under physiologically relevant conditions expanded ataxin-3 can form amyloid-like fibrils (19Chow M.K. Ellisdon A.M. Cabrita L.D. Bottomley S.P. J. Biol.

Biol. 2005; 353: 642-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The conclusion from these studies is that the poly(Q) tract is the main mediator of the aggregation process, with other domains and surrounding residues playing secondary roles in modulating aggregation (34Nozaki K. Onodera O. Takano H. Tsuji S. Neuroreport. 2001; 12: 3357-3364Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Recently however, it was shown that under destabilizing conditions the Josephin domain alone is capable of forming amyloid-like fibrils, with a similar rate to full-length ataxin-3 containing a 15-residue-long poly(Q) tract (29Masino L. Nicastro G. Menon R.P. Dal Piaz F. Calder L. Pastore A. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 344: 1021-1035Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). The authors suggested that the Josephin domain is a major determinant in ataxin-3 aggregation, with the poly(Q) tract playing a role in increasing the rate of fibril formation (29Masino L. Nicastro G. Menon R.P. Dal Piaz F. Calder L. Pastore A. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 344: 1021-1035Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Although it is clear that the poly(Q) tract is necessary for kinetic instigation of aggregation and, therefore, the disease process, these data and other work have led to the hypothesis that non-poly(Q)-containing domains may play a large role in determining the aggregation characteristics and toxicity of poly(Q) proteins (35de Chiara C. Menon R.P. Dal Piaz F. Calder L. Pastore A. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 354: 883-893Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 36Fernandez-Funez P. Nino-Rosales M.L. de Gouyon B. She W.C. Luchak J.M.

A. 2005; 102: 11402-11407Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). We have therefore studied a range of ataxin-3 variants in an attempt to understand how both the poly(Q) tract and protein context kinetically and structurally characterize the aggregation pathway. These variants include ataxin-3 without a poly(Q) tract (at3(QHQ)), a non-pathological length variant with 15 glutamines (at3(Q15)), and pathological length ataxin-3 with 64 glutamines (at3(Q64)). We firstly demonstrate that full-length ataxin-3 has an intrinsic ability to form amyloid-like fibrils independent of the poly(Q) tract. However, we further show that a pathological length poly(Q) tract introduces a second step into the aggregation pathway, which dramatically alters the stability and morphology of the end-stage fibrils. Materials—Phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, thioflavin T (ThT), and β-mercaptoethanol were all obtained from Sigma. Expression and Purification of Ataxin-3 Variants—All ataxin-3 variants were expressed and purified as described previously (19Chow M.K. Ellisdon A.M. Cabrita L.D. Bottomley S.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 47643-47651Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Protein was stored at –80°C and run on a Superose 12 column prior to each experiment to confirm it was monomeric. Fibrillogenesis Time-course Assays—Ataxin-3 variants were incubated at a concentration of 30 μm at pH 7.4 in Tris-buffered saline (TBS) (100 mm Tris, 80 mm NaCl) containing 10% (v/v) glycerol, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (2 mm), EDTA (5 mm), and β-mercaptoethanol (15 mm). Reactions were performed at 37°C without shaking and in airtight containers to eliminate evaporation. Membrane Filter Trap Assay—The membrane filter-trap assay was carried out as previously described with only minor modifications (16Scherzinger E. Lurz R. Turmaine M. Mangiarini L. Hollenbach B. Hasenbank R. Bates G.P. Davies S.W. Lehrach H. Wanker E.E. Cell. 1997; 90: 549-558Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1084) Google Scholar, 17Scherzinger E. Sittler A. Schweiger K.

An aliquot of protein (30 μg) was removed from the fibrillogenesis time-course incubations and diluted into 4% SDS (w/v) and 100 mm dithiothreitol at a 1:1 ratio. The samples were heated for 5 min at 100°C before being diluted to 200 μl with 0.1% (w/v) SDS. The samples were filtered through a cellulose acetate membrane (Schleicher and Schuell, 0.2 μm) using a Bio-Rad Bio-Dot SF microfiltration unit. After application, the membrane was washed twice by filtering through 200 μl of 0.1% SDS (w/v). The membranes were then blotted with a hexahistidine (His6) antibody (Serotec). ThT Measurements—ThT fluorescence was measured using a BMG Laboratories FLUOstar Optima fluorescence plate reader. Excitation and emission filters used were for 450 and 490 nm, respectively. All reactions were carried out in black 384-well clear bottom plates with both excitation and emission read from the bottom. Reactions were carried out at 37°C, without shaking, and the top of the plate was sealed to prevent any evaporation. Plate reader assays contained 20 μm ThT, with all other buffering solutions and additives remaining the same as previously described herein. Discontinuous assays, carried out without the continual presence of ThT, displayed comparable kinetics to the continuous plate reader assays (data not shown). SDS Stability Assays—An aliquot of 15 μg of end-stage fibrils was removed from the fibril assays and immediately diluted into 200 μl of SDS at the indicated concentration. Samples were incubated for 20 min at room temperature before being filtered through a 0.2-μm cellulose acetate membrane (Schleicher & Schuell). The membrane was pre-equilibrated in TBS, and after filtration 200 μl of TBS was filtered through the membrane as a washing stage. The membrane was then probed as previously described for the membrane filter-trap assay. QBP1 Aggregation Assays—The QBP1 peptide was purchased from AusPep with the same sequence as described previously (38Nagai Y. Tucker T. Ren H. Kenan D.J. Henderson B.S. Keene J.D. Strittmatter W.J. Burke J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 10437-10442Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). The peptide was dissolved in Me2SO to a final concentration of 13.5 mm. The peptide was incubated with ataxin-3 aggregation assays at a concentration of 120 μm. Upon final dilution the concentration of Me2SO was <1%. Control assays with identical final Me2SO concentrations were used for comparison with QBP1 assays. Fluorescence Spectroscopy—All fluorescence measurements were performed by diluting aliquots of sample into TBS (pH 7.4) to a final concentration of 1 μm. Fluorescence emission spectra were immediately recorded on a PerkinElmer Life Sciences LS50B spectrofluorometer with a thermostatted cuvette holder at 25°C, using a 1-cm path length quartz cuvette. For intrinsic fluorescence measurements an excitation wavelength of 280 nm was used, with measurement of the emission spectra from 300 to 450 nm. Emission and excitation slit widths were set at 2.5 and 3.0 nm, respectively, and a scan speed of 25 nm/min was used. Size Exclusion Analysis of Fibril Formation—Size exclusion chromatography (SEC) was carried out on an Amersham Biosciences fast protein liquid chromatography system. Fibril formation was monitored by the loss of area of the monomer peak on a Superose 12 column. At indicated time points 20 μg of protein was injected onto the column, and its elution was monitored by absorbance at 214 nm. The area of the peak was calculated using the manufacturers supplied software. Circular Dichroism—CD analysis was carried out by removing aliquots of protein from the incubating sample and diluting into TBS to 21.4 μm immediately prior to analysis. All far-UV CD spectra were measured on a Jasco-810 spectropolarimeter with a path length of 0.1 mm. Spectra were recorded from 190 to 260 nm, using a 5-s/point signal averaging, and a scan speed of 20 nm/min. Transmission Electron Microscopy—TEM images were obtained using a Jeol JEM-200CX transmission electron microscope. The acceleration voltage was 100 kV. Samples were adsorbed onto carbon-coated grids and stained with 1% (w/v) uranyl acetate. Analysis of Seeded Aggregation—End-stage aggregates were added to the fibril reaction immediately prior to incubation at 10% of the total molar concentration. A reaction containing seed only was analyzed, and the result was used to correct kinetics of seeded samples. ThT and membrane filter-trap assays were carried out as previously described herein. Characterization of Ataxin-3 Variants—We expressed and purified three ataxin-3 variants from Escherichia coli as previously described (19Chow M.K. Ellisdon A.M. Cabrita L.D. Bottomley S.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 47643-47651Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1A). Using SEC (Fig. 1B) and mass spectrometry (data not shown) we confirmed that the final purified proteins were entirely monomeric and intact. Furthermore, all the variants possessed ubiquitin-protease activity as previously described (data not shown) (3Chow M.K. Mackay J.P. Whisstock J.C. Scanlon M.J. Bottomley S.P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2004; 322: 387-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Only Expanded Ataxin-3 Forms SDS-resistant Aggregates—One common feature of poly(Q) aggregates is their ability to retain structure upon incubation with SDS (16Scherzinger E. Lurz R. Turmaine M.

We initially analyzed the aggregation of all ataxin-3 variants using the membrane filter-trap assay routinely used to detect SDS-resistant huntingtin exon 1 fibrils (16Scherzinger E. Lurz R.

Upon incubation of all variants, at a concentration of 30 μm, we observe that only pathological length at3(Q64) forms SDS-resistant aggregates (Fig. 2A). Further analysis of the aggregation with densitometry reveals that at3(Q64) aggregation follows a classic nucleation-dependent time course, with a defined lag period followed by a rapid growth phase (Fig. 2B). Even upon incubation times of up to 200 h, at3(QHQ) and at3(Q15) did not form SDS-resistant aggregates, suggesting that under physiologically relevant conditions ataxin-3 forms SDS-resistant aggregates in a poly(Q) length-dependent manner similar to that seen in other poly(Q) proteins (15Chen S.

In addition to the filter-trap assay we followed the aggregation reaction with the fluorescent dye ThT. We analyzed the aggregation properties of the three ataxin-3 variants, under identical conditions (Fig. 2C). In contrast to the filter-trap assay we observed that all the variants are able to form ThT-positive aggregates. The rate of aggregation was poly(Q)-length dependent, with at3(Q64) aggregating at a faster rate than either at3(QHQ) or at3(Q15). However intriguingly, both at3(QHQ) and at3(Q15) aggregate with essentially identical kinetics (Table 1). The kinetics display time-squared dependence (data not shown) suggestive of a nucleation-dependent time course (40Ferrone F. Methods Enzymol. 1999; 309: 256-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar, 41Collins S.R. Douglass A. Vale R.D. Weissman J.S. PLoS Biol. 2004; 2: e321Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar). As at3(QHQ) contains no poly(Q) tract, it appears that the ataxin-3 protein contains an inherent propensity to form ThT-positive aggregates independently of the poly(Q) tract. In a recent study, the Josephin domain of ataxin-3 has been shown to form amyloid-like aggregates upon thermal stress (29Masino L. Nicastro G. Menon R.P. Dal Piaz F. Calder L. Pastore A. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 344: 1021-1035Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Furthermore, numerous ataxin-3 variants with non-pathological length poly(Q) tracts have been shown to form amyloid-like aggregates under both near-physiological conditions (33Gales L. Cortes L. Almeida C. Melo C.V. do Carmo Costa M. Maciel P. Clarke D.T. Damas A.M. Macedo-Ribeiro S. J. Mol.

Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 14626-14632Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is possible that the protein region responsible for the formation of ThT-positive aggregates involves the N-terminal Josephin domain, which is common to all of the proteins, although further work is needed to clarify this (29Masino L.

The first is a ThT-detectable stage common to all variants, and this is followed by a second poly(Q)-length dependent stage in which classic SDS-insoluble poly(Q) aggregates are formed. A small degree of overlap is seen between the two phases, however the bulk of SDS-resistant aggregates do not appear to form until after a significant ThT increase. Therefore, our data indicate that the three variants form different aggregates based upon the length of their poly-Q tract. If this is the case then the aggregates formed are likely to possess different stabilities. To examine these differences we analyzed the resistance of these end-stage aggregates to SDS. End-stage aggregates of the three proteins were incubated with increasing concentrations of SDS to determine any stability differences (Fig. 3). As can be seen, only at3(Q64) aggregates are stable upon incubation in up to 1% (w/v) SDS. The two shorter variants both lose the ability to be retained on the 0.2-μm filter after incubation in a very low 0.01% (w/v) SDS. This strongly suggests that the aggregates formed from expanded ataxin-3 are structurally different to those of the non-expanded variants. Furthermore, this increased stability of expanded ataxin-3 aggregates may have ramifications in the pathogenesis of the disease, as more stable aggregates are likely to be harder to break down and longer lived. QBP1 Inhibits the Second Phase of at3(Q64) Aggregation—The data presented above suggest a two-step mechanism of aggregation with only the pathological length poly(Q) tract playing a role in formation of SDS-stable aggregates. To confirm this, we have used the QBP1 peptide as a tool to explore the role of the poly(Q) tract in defining the at3(Q64) aggregation pathway. The QBP1 peptide is 11 amino acids in length and has been shown to inhibit poly(Q) aggregation both in vitro and in vivo (38Nagai Y. Tucker T. Ren H. Kenan D.J. Henderson B.S. Keene J.D.

In Fig. 4 we followed the aggregation of 30 μm at3(Q64) by the combination of the filter-trap assay and the ThT assay. Upon incubation of the QBP1 peptide, at a molar ratio of 4:1 (peptide:protein), we still observe the initial ThT increase (Fig. 4C). However, the second stage of aggregation is completely eliminated, with no detectable SDS-insoluble aggregates formed in the presence of QBP1 (Fig. 4, A and B). Taken together these data indicate that expanded ataxin-3 aggregates through a two-stage pathway, with only the second stage reliant on the presence of an expanded glutamine tract. We then went on to further structurally and kinetically characterize this pathway using a range of techniques. Ataxin-3 Aggregation Monitored by Intrinsic Fluorescence and Size Exclusion Chromatography—The two-step mechanism of aggregation proposed above suggests that the N-terminal domain of ataxin-3, which is common to all the proteins, is involved in the first step. To determine if this is the case we exploited the fact that ataxin-3 contains three tryptophan residues, all of which are located within the Josephin domain, as such they act as a highly sensitive reporter groups for the tertiary structure of this domain. We therefore followed the changes in intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence during aggregation for all three proteins. We observe that, upon formation of the final aggregate conformation, all three variants adopt a hyper-fluorescent state in which the emission maxima has shifted from 333 nm in the native state to 340 nm in the aggregate (Fig. 5, A–C). These data suggest that Josephin ha"

Recently identified prokaryotic members of this protein family may provide a key to the evolutionary origins of the unique serpin fold and the associated inhibitory mechanism. We performed a biochemical characterization of a serpin from Bifidobacterium longum, an anaerobic Gram-positive bacterium that naturally colonizes human gastrointestinal tract. The B. longum serpin was shown to efficiently inhibit eukaryotic elastase-like proteases with a stoichiometry of inhibition close to 1. Porcine pancreatic elastase and human neutrophil elastase were inhibited with the second order association constants of 4.7 × 104 m-1 s-1 and 2.1 × 104 m-1 s-1, respectively. The B. longum serpin is expected to be active in the gastrointestinal tract, because incubation of the purified recombinant serpin with mouse feces produces a stable covalent serpin-protease adduct readily detectable by SDS-PAGE. Bifidobacteria may encounter both pancreatic elastase and neutrophil elastase in their natural habitat and protection against exogenous proteolysis may play an important role in the interaction between these commensal bacteria and their host.

Numerous signaling pathways in higher organisms, such as apoptosis, inflammation, blood clotting, and others, involve proteolytic events as mediators of signal initiation, transmission, and termination. Substrate specificity of the involved proteases and a tight regulation of their activation and inhibition are essential regulatory mechanisms of temporal and spatial control in proteolytic signaling. Serpins (serine protease inhibitors) represent a large class of polypeptide serine protease inhibitors that are involved in regulation of a wide spectrum of protease-mediated processes (1Gettins P.G.

Upon cleavage of RCL by the target protease and formation of the covalent acyl-enzyme reaction intermediate, the serpin fold undergoes a major conformational rearrangement, and the RCL is inserted as the middle strand of the beta sheet A to form a six-stranded anti-parallel β sheet at the core of the cleaved serpin structure (4Loebermann H. Tokuoka R. Deisenhofer J. Huber R. J. Mol. Biol. 1984; 177: 531-557Crossref PubMed Scopus (607) Google Scholar). This conformational change creates a steric clash with the protease and the resulting distortion inactivates the enzyme and traps it as a covalent serpin-protease adduct (5Huntington J.A. Read R.J. Carrell R.W. Nature. 2000; 407: 923-926Crossref PubMed Scopus (938) Google Scholar).Serpins are widely distributed in higher eukaryotic organisms and are also found in some viruses where they appear to modulate virus-host interactions and viral infectivity (1Gettins P.G. Chem. Rev. 2002; 102: 4751-4804Crossref PubMed Scopus (979) Google Scholar). Thirty-four serpins identified in the human genome belong to nine different phylogenetic clades in the currently adopted serpin classification (2Silverman G.A. Bird P.I. Carrell R.W. Church F.C.

Notably, some members of the serpin superfamily, such as ovalbumin, angiotensin, and others (6Hunt L.T. Dayhoff M.O. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

These non-inhibitory members of the serpin superfamily appear to be incapable of the structural rearrangement required for protease inhibition (8Wright H.T. Qian H.X. Huber R. J. Mol.

This observation suggests that the unique serpin fold and the associated inhibitory mechanism may have originated at the early stages of evolution. Very little is currently known about the function of serpins in prokaryotes (11Roberts T.H. Hejgaard J. Saunders N.F. Cavicchioli R. Curmi P.M. J. Mol. Evol. 2004; 59: 437-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The sequence-based analysis suggests that prokaryotic members of the serpin superfamily are functional protease inhibitors, and a serpin from Thermobifida fusca, thermopin, was shown to inhibit chymotrypsin albeit by means of an unconventional cleavage site (12Irving J.A.

Thermopin is, however, unusual because of its ability to function at elevated temperature, whereas conventional serpins are prone to polymerization at higher temperature due to the metastable nature of their native fold (13Fulton K.F.

To explore the physiological role of this B. longum protein in the GIT environment and its possible function in host-bacterium cross-talk, we performed a biochemical characterization of this hypothetical serpin.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESEnzymes, Inhibitors, and Substrates—The following enzymes and reagents were used: bovine pancreatic α-chymotrypsin, porcine pancreatic trypsin, and porcine pancreatic elastase (Fluka, now Sigma); subtilisin Carlsberg, papain (from papaya latex), and human neutrophil elastase (human leukocyte elastase) (Sigma); cathepsin G (human neutrophil) (Athens Research and Technology, Athens, GA); MeOSuc-AAPV-AMC and MeOSuc-AAPA-chloromethylketone (Bachem AG, Bubendorf, Switzerland); and MCA-RPKPVE-Nval-WRK(Dnp)-NH2 and human α1-antitrypsin (SERPIN A1) (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN).Production of B. longum serpin in Escherichia coli—The serpin gene (BL0108) from B. longum without the sequence encoding the N-terminal hydrophobic domain (amino acids 1-40) was cloned into the Gateway expression vector pDEST17 (Invitrogen). The final construct contained a 22 amino acid N-terminal extension (MSYYHHHHHHLESTSLYKKAGF) with a His6 tag for affinity purification. The E. coli BL21S1 cells were transformed using the standard protocol (Invitrogen). Cells were grown in M9 minimal medium containing 100 mg/liter of ampicillin, and protein expression was induced by addition of 0.1 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside. For production of 15N-labeled protein, 1 g of 15NH4Cl was used as the sole nitrogen source in M9 medium.Protein Purification—Frozen cells from 1 liter of bacterial culture were resuspended in 50 ml of lysis buffer (50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.2, 200 mm NaCl, 0.2 mm Pefabloc, 1 mg/ml lysozyme, 10 μg/ml DNase I), and lysed by sonication. The cell debris were cleared by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 30 min. The protein was purified on a 5-ml HiTrap chelating HP column (Amerhsam Biosciences) charged with Ni2+ ions using the standard protocol. After the imidazole gradient elution the protein was further purified by size-exclusion chromatography using a HiLoad 26/60 Superdex 75 gel filtration column (Amersham Biosciences) and a 50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.2, 100 mm NaCl buffer.Survey of B. longum Serpin Inhibitory Activity—All reactions were performed in 50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.2, 100 mm NaCl buffer with the exception of human neutrophil elastase, which was assayed in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 500 mm NaCl buffer. The stock solutions of fluorogenic peptide substrates were prepared in Me2SO and stored at -40 °C. The Me2SO substrate stocks were diluted ∼100-fold into reaction buffers to prepare 2× substrate buffers (20 μm for MCA-RPKPVE-Nval-WRK(Dnp)-NH2; 400 μm for MeOSuc-AAPV-AMC and MeOSuc-AAPF-AMC). The enzymes were then incubated for 40 min with various amounts of serpin (20 nm to 10 μm). The enzymatic activity was subsequently assayed by rapidly mixing 50 μl of the substrate buffer with 50 μl of the enzyme/serpin solution in a 96-well clear bottom plates and recording the fluorescence change on a FLEXStation fluorescence plate reader (Molecular Devices Corp., Sunnyvale, CA).Kinetics of Inhibition—The kinetic parameters of serpin inhibition were determined by the progress curve method (16Bieth J.G. Bull. Eur. Physiopathol. Respir. 1980; 16: 183-197PubMed Google Scholar, 17Schechter N.M. Plotnick M.I. Methods. 2004; 32: 159-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The enzymes and the substrates were dissolved in reaction buffers. Various amounts of serpin were added to the substrate solution to yield final concentrations of ∼2-10-fold excess over the enzyme concentration. The substrate/serpin and the enzyme solutions were incubated at 37 °C for 10 min, and then 50 μl of each were rapidly mixed, and the progress curve fluorescence readings were recorded at 37 °C. The first-order association rates kobs were determined by non-linear regression fitting of the progress curve data using Equation 1. P=(v0/kobs)(1−e(−kobs·t))(Eq. 1) The initial rate (v0) was determined from the progress curve at zero serpin concentration. For experiments where excess of serpin over the protease was too low to ensure validity of the pseudo first-order approximation, only the initial parts of the progress curves were used for nonlinear regression fitting of kobs. The apparent second-order association constant was determined as the slope of the kobs versus [I] plot (k′app = Δkobs/Δ[I]), where [I] is the corresponding serpin concentration. The second-order association rate was then corrected taking into account that the serpin and the fluorescent substrate compete for the active site of the protease: ka = (1 + [S]/KM) k′app, where [S] is substrate concentration, and the Km of the enzyme for the substrate was determined from the Lineweaver-Burk plot. MeOSuc-AAPV-AMC Km was 362 μm for human neutrophil elastase (HNE) and 275 μm for porcine pancreatic elastase (PPE).Stoichiometry of Inhibition (SI), Covalent Serpin-Protease Adduct, and the Cleavage Site—Protein concentrations were determined using theoretically calculated extinction coefficients at 280 nm: 54,390 m-1 cm-1 (PPE), 20,100 m-1 cm-1 (HNE), and 59,150 m-1 cm-1 (B. longum serpin). Proteases were also titrated with stoichiometric activators: PPE with MeOSuc-AAPA-chloromethylketone and HNE with α1-antitrypsin. Enzyme concentrations determined by such titration were within 15% from the values determined by the A280 measurements.Covalent protease-serpin adducts were prepared by incubation of 10 μm solutions of serpin with varying amounts of protease (2.5, 5, 10, and 20 μm) in the standard reaction buffers. After 5-min incubation at room temperature 50 μm AEBSF (Sigma) was added to the mixtures, and the samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. The content of the bands of the Coomassie-stained gel was identified using tandem MS analysis by NanoLC-ESI-MS/MS on a Finnigan LCQ classic ion trap (Thermo, San Jose, CA) (18Marvin-Guy L. Lopes L.V. Affolter M. Courtet-Compondu M.-C. Wagniere S. Bergonzelli G.E. Fay L.B. Kussmann M. Proteomics. 2005; 5: 2561-2569Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar).Cleavage Site—The RCL cleavage site was determined by MALDI-MS analysis of the peptide fragments after incubation of serpin with proteases. The 20 μm serpin and 10 μm protease mixture was incubated for 5 min in the reaction buffer at room temperature. The masses of the peptide fragments were determined by MALDI-MS (Bruker Autoflex ToF) in linear mode (19Marvin-Guy L.F. Parche S. Wagniere S. Moulin J. Zink R. Kussmann M. Fay L.B. J. Am. Soc. Mass Spectrom. 2004; 15: 1222-1227Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar).Incubation of Serpin with Fecal Proteins—Feces from axenic mice were resuspended in 1× phosphate-buffered saline with glass beads (Sigma G4649) and lysed in a Beadbeater (Mini-Beadbeater, BioSpec Products). The debris and the glass beads were removed by centrifugation at 12,000 rpm for 10 min. Purified serpin (10 ng) was incubated 10 min at room temperature with different amounts of fecal proteins and then mixed with 4× sample buffer and boiled for 5 min. Protein samples were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to pure nitrocellulose membrane (0.2 μm; Bio-Rad) using standard methods. The membrane was blocked for 60 min with 5% skimmed milk in 1× Tris-buffered saline and probed with rabbit anti B. longum serpin antibodies diluted 1:3000. The antigen-antibody complex was detected with a goat anti-rabbit IgG conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (Bio-Rad; diluted 1:3000) using the BM chemiluminescence substrate from Roche Applied Science.RESULTSPrimary Sequence Analysis of B. longum Serpin—The BLASTP program (20Altschul S.F. Madden T.L. Schaffer A.A. Zhang J. Zhang Z. Miller W. Lipman D.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3389-3402Crossref PubMed Scopus (59138) Google Scholar) was used to search for the closest homologues of the predicted B. longum serpin (BL0108) in the non-redundant protein data base of National Center for Biotechnology Information. The sequence alignment with several representative serpin sequences returned by the BLASTP query is shown in Fig. 1. Current serpin classification divides serpin sequences into clades based on their phylogenetic relationships (21Irving J.A. Pike R.N. Lesk A.M. Whisstock J.C. Genome Res. 2000; 10: 1845-1864Crossref PubMed Scopus (505) Google Scholar), with members of the same clade defined by the normalized BLAST score of larger than 279 bits (2Silverman G.A. Bird P.I. Carrell R.W. Church F.C. Coughlin P.B. Gettins P.G. Irving J.A. Lomas D.A. Luke C.J. Moyer R.W. Pemberton P.A. Remold-O'Donnell E. Salvesen G.S. Travis J. Whisstock J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 33293-33296Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1056) Google Scholar). The highest similarity score observed for B. longum serpin homologues returned by BLAST is 139 bits (E = 2e-31, ∼28% sequence identity), which qualifies B. longum serpin as an orphan in the current classification. Most of the top 10 matches in the BLASTP query are serpins from other prokaryotic species, two of which are shown in Fig. 1, while the closest homologues from eukaryotic serpin clades return BLAST scores below 120 bits (Fig. 1).The B. longum serpin is predicted to contain all secondary structure elements of the conserved serpin fold and is therefore expected to form a stably folded, functional protein. Analysis of the RCL alignment predicts that the cleaved bond of the B. longum serpin is located between valine and serine (Fig. 1).Purification of B. longum Serpin and Survey of Inhibitory Activity—The serpin encoded by B. longum was predicted by TMHMM (22Krogh A. Larsson B. von Heijne G. Sonnhammer E.L. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 305: 567-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (8870) Google Scholar) to be directed to the membrane via its N-terminal hydrohphobic region and to be exposed on the surface of B. longum cells. The DNA sequence encoding the core serpin domain without the predicted hydrophobic domain (amino acids 1-40) was cloned into an E. coli expression vector and the protein was purified as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The expressed protein was predominantly soluble, and protein purification yielded more than 10 mg of protein per liter of culture. The purified protein was more than 95% pure by SDS-PAGE analysis.To experimentally verify that the B. longum serpin is indeed an inhibitory serpin as suggested by its primary sequence analysis, we screened for its inhibitory activity against a selection of proteases (Table 1). The proteases were incubated with varied amounts of serpin for 40 min, after which the residual protease activity was assayed by detecting hydrolysis of fluorogenic substrates. B. longum serpin was found to inhibit proteases from the elastase family, which is consistent with the presence of a valine residue in the P1 position of the reactive center loop. Complete inhibition was observed for porcine pancreatic elastase and human neutrophil elastase after incubation with excess amounts of B. longum serpin. No other proteases included in the screen showed any statistically significant degree of inhibition. Notably, the observed inhibition profile of the B. longum serpin is distinct from the inhibition profile of the physiological serpin inhibitors of human neutrophil elastase. α1-Antitrypsin (SERPINA1), for example, is also known to inhibit trypsin, while monocyte/neutrophil elastase inhibitor (SERPINB1) acts as an efficient cathepsin G inhibitor. Differences in the RCL composition, which affect targeting of proteases to the correct cleavage site, are likely to be responsible for the distinct inhibition profiles of these serpins. Indeed, trypsin appears to cleave B. longum serpin at an RCL site not compatible with inhibition (see below).TABLE 1Survey of protease inhibition by B. longum serpinProtease (final concentration)B. longum serpin (maximum concentration)InhibitionSubstrate (final concentration)α-Chymotrypsin (50 nm)5 μmNoMCA-RPKPVE-Nval-WRK(Dnp)-NH2 (10 μm)Trypsin (50 nm)5 μmNoMCA-RPKPVE-Nval-WRK(Dnp)-NH2 (10 μm)Subtilisin Carlsberg (50 nm)5 μmNoMCA-RPKPVE-Nval-WRK(Dnp)-NH2 (10 μm)Pancreatic elastase PPE (50 nm)0.13 μm100%MeOSuc-AAPV-AMC (200 μm)Neutrophil elastase HNE (100 nm)1 μm100%MeOSuc-AAPV-AMC (200 μm)Cathepsin G (170 nm)10 μmNoMeOSuc-AAPF-AMC (200 μm)Papain (8 μm)16 μmNoMeOSuc-AAPF-AMC (200 μm) Open table in a new tab B. longum Serpin Acts as a Stoichiometric Covalent Inactivator—To demonstrate that B. longum serpin inhibits target proteases via a classic stoichiometric inactivation mechanism, activities of PPE, and HNE were measured after incubation with various amounts of serpin. The linear decrease of activity observed for both proteases was consistent with the stoichiometric inactivation mechanism of serpin inhibition (Fig. 2). The SI was determined to be close to 1.FIGURE 2Stoichiometric protease inhibition by B. longum serpin. Fractional activity of PPE (—▪—) and of HNE (—○—) measured after incubation with various concentrations of B. longum serpin.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To demonstrate the covalent nature of inhibition, we investigated whether a stable covalent adduct of the serpin with the protease could be identified by SDS-PAGE. A fixed amount of serpin (10 μm) was incubated with various amounts of PPE and HNE, and the products of the reaction were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and coomassie staining (Fig. 3, A and B). Protein bands of higher molecular weight indicative of the covalent serpin-protease adduct are readily visible on the gel after the incubation of the serpin with each of the two proteases. More than one band appeared at higher molecular weight values when compared with the band of the pure serpin alone. To further characterize the bands we performed tandem mass spectrometry (MS-MS) identification of their protein content (Fig. 3C). The serpin amino acid sequence and the SWISSPROT data base were used for analysis of the MS-MS data by SEQUEST program (Thermo Finnigan). Bands 3 and 5 (Fig. 3A) were clearly identified as pure serpin and pure PPE respectively, with 10 peptides matched in each case. When the serpin was incubated with increasing amounts of the protease, the pure serpin band (band 3, Fig. 3A) disappeared as new bands (bands 1, 2, and 4) emerged. Band 4 most likely corresponds to cleaved serpin, since only one PPE peptide matched to this band indicating that low amounts of the protease were present (if any). In contrast, bands 1 and 2 (Fig. 3, A and C) were both clearly identified as covalent adducts of the serpin with the protease. Very similar results were obtained with human neutrophil elastase (Fig. 3, B and C). Semiquantitative estimate of the band intensities is consistent with the SI value of 2 or less, which agrees well with our titration experiments. Multiple adduct bands may be due to the fact that the protease is destabilized in the covalent complex and is therefore susceptible to proteolysis. Alternatively the band mobility on the gel may be affected by the incomplete unfolding of the serpin, which adopts an extremely stable conformation upon cleavage. The latter explanation is supported by the observation that mobility of band 2 depended on the duration and the temperature of the sample treatment in the loading buffer before SDS-PAGE (data not shown).FIGURE 3B. longum serpin forms a stable covalent adduct with the target proteases.

The measured rate of the serpin-HNE association (ka = 4.7 × 104 m-1 s-1) was similar to the rate of serpin-PPE association (ka = 2.1 × 104 m-1 s-1). For comparison α1-antitrypsin inhibits HNE and PPE with the association rates of ka = 6.5 × 107 m-1 s-1 and ka = 1.0 × 105 m-1 s-1, respectively (23Beatty K. Bieth J. Travis J. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 3931-3934Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).FIGURE 4Kinetics of protease inhibition by B. longum serpin. A, human neutrophil elastase inhibition. Final HNE concentration in all reaction mixtures was 0.1 μm and final serpin concentrations were 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, and 0.8 μm. B, porcine pancreatic elastase inhibition.

The second-order association constants were determined from the slope of the plots by linear regression (solid lines). The raw progress curve data are shown in the insets.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Cleavage Site—Finally, we checked whether pancreatic elastase and neutrophil elastase cleave the predicted P1-P1′ bond of the reactive center loop. When the protease is trapped by the serpin in the acyl-enzyme intermediate, the cleaved-off N-terminal segment of the serpin is no longer covalently attached to the protein and can be analyzed by mass spectrometry. The molecular mass of this cleaved N-terminal peptide can be used to determine location of the cleavage site. The B. longum serpin was incubated with the enzymes for 10 min at room temperature and the molecular weight of the formed peptide fragments were determined by MALDI-MS (Fig. 5). In addition to PPE and HNE, we also analyzed cleavage products after incubation with trypsin, for which no inhibition was observed in our titration assays. Once again 100% uniformly 15N-labeled serpin was used in these experiments. For HNE the molecular mass (MH+) of the major fragment was 4505.6, which is a very good match for the theoretical (MH+) value of 4506.0 predicted for the P1-P1′ cleavage site in the 15N-labeled protein. This peptide was also the major fragment observed for porcine pancreatic elastase, although several minor fragments corresponding to different cleavage sites were also observed. For trypsin the primary cleavage site was determined to be between Lys381 and Val382. This observation explains the la"
https://openalex.org/W2025813437,"Chromosome 17 is unusual among the human chromosomes in many respects. It is the largest human autosome with orthology to only a single mouse chromosome, mapping entirely to the distal half of mouse chromosome 11. Chromosome 17 is rich in protein-coding genes, having the second highest gene density in the genome. It is also enriched in segmental duplications, ranking third in density among the autosomes. Here we report a finished sequence for human chromosome 17, as well as a structural comparison with the finished sequence for mouse chromosome 11, the first finished mouse chromosome. Comparison of the orthologous regions reveals striking differences. In contrast to the typical pattern seen in mammalian evolution, the human sequence has undergone extensive intrachromosomal rearrangement, whereas the mouse sequence has been remarkably stable. Moreover, although the human sequence has a high density of segmental duplication, the mouse sequence has a very low density. Notably, these segmental duplications correspond closely to the sites of structural rearrangement, demonstrating a link between duplication and rearrangement. Examination of the main classes of duplicated segments provides insight into the dynamics underlying expansion of chromosome-specific, low-copy repeats in the human genome."
https://openalex.org/W1982503219,"An even more extreme version of the ‘confinement’ effect — when electron charge motion in layered transition-metal oxides is highly anisotropic, ranging from metallic within the plane of the layers to near insulating in the perpendicular direction — is reported in a layered manganese oxide. A remarkable feature of layered transition-metal oxides—most famously, the high-temperature superconductors—is that they can display hugely anisotropic electrical and optical properties (for example, seeming to be insulating perpendicular to the layers and metallic within them), even when prepared as bulk three-dimensional single crystals. This is the phenomenon of ‘confinement’, a concept at odds with the conventional theory of solids, and recognized1 as due to magnetic and electron–lattice interactions within the layers that must be overcome at a substantial energy cost if electrons are to be transferred between layers. The associated energy gap, or ‘pseudogap’, is particularly obvious in experiments where charge is moved perpendicular to the planes, most notably scanning tunnelling microscopy2 and polarized infrared spectroscopy3. Here, using the same experimental tools, we show that there is a second family of transition-metal oxides—the layered manganites La2-2xSr1+2xMn2O7—with even more extreme confinement and pseudogap effects. The data demonstrate quantitatively that because the charge carriers are attached to polarons (lattice- and spin-textures within the planes), it is as difficult to remove them from the planes through vacuum-tunnelling into a conventional metallic tip, as it is for them to move between Mn-rich layers within the material itself."

The hemolytic and the RTX domains display structural characteristics that link CyaA to the RTX (repeat in toxin) family of bacterial toxins (20Welch R.A. Mol.

The crystal structure of the Pseudomonas aeruginosa alkaline protease that has six of these consensus RTX repeats revealed that these sequences constitute a new kind of calcium binding structure, called a parallel β-helix or parallel β-roll motif (27Baumann U.

The main originality of the CyaA toxin stems from its unique mechanism of penetration into eukaryotic cells, as its catalytic domain appears to be directly translocated through the plasma membrane of the target cells (5Bellalou J.

Recently, it has been demonstrated that CyaA binds specifically to target cells through the αMβ2 integrin receptor (CD11b/CD18) (30Guermonprez P. Khelef N. Blouin E. Rieu P. Ricciardi-Castagnoli P.

Expression of this receptor most likely accounts for the high sensitivity of these cells to CyaA (13Khelef N. Guiso N. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1995; 134: 27-32Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 30Guermonprez P. Khelef N. Blouin E. Rieu P. Ricciardi-Castagnoli P. Guiso N. Ladant D. Leclerc C. J. Exp. Med. 2001; 193: 1035-1044Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). CyaA is a calcium-binding protein that undergoes conformational changes upon binding of calcium (9Hanski E. Farfel Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 5526-5532Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Hewlett E.L. Gray L. Allietta M. Ehrmann I. Gordon V.M. Gray M.C. J. Biol.

Chem. 1995; 270: 26370-26376Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). The entry/translocation of CyaA into target cells is strictly dependent upon the presence of calcium ions in the millimolar range, and the RTX domain is supposed to be directly involved in this process as it harbors the main low affinity Ca2+-binding sites (9Hanski E. Farfel Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 5526-5532Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Hewlett E.L. Gray L. Allietta M. Ehrmann I. Gordon V.M. Gray M.C. J. Biol.

Chem. 1995; 270: 26370-26376Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). How binding of calcium ions to the RTX motifs might trigger the translocation of CyaA into cells remains totally unknown. The RTX domain of CyaA is organized in five successive blocks (Ile to Val) of about 8 nonapeptide RTX motifs (Fig. 1) separated by linkers of variable length (from 23 to 49 residues). Previous results from Iwaki et al. (32Iwaki M. Ullmann A. Sebo P. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 17: 1015-1024Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) have suggested that the last 217 C-terminal residues of CyaA that encompasses the block V (residues 1490–1706) might constitute a functional subdomain; a truncated CyaA lacking the last 217 C-terminal residues was unable to intoxicate target cells but could be partially complemented by other CyaA fragments harboring at least these last 217 C-terminal residues (32Iwaki M. Ullmann A. Sebo P. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 17: 1015-1024Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Subsequently, Bejerano et al. (33Bejerano M. Nisan I. Ludwig A. Goebel W. Hanski E. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 31: 381-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) corroborated these data by showing that a purified polypeptide comprising these 217 C-terminal residues of CyaA could fully restore toxic activity of an inactive truncated CyaA lacking the 76 C-terminal amino acids. To gain insight into the potential function of the RTX calcium binding motif/domain, we have constructed different fragments derived from the RTX domain and characterized the functional (ability to complement in vivo an inactive truncated CyaA), biophysical (fluorescence, circular dichroism spectroscopy, and channel-forming activity in lipid bilayers), and biochemical (calcium binding) properties in vivo and in vitro. Our results suggest a model for the folding of the RTX modules in which the functional calcium binding structure extends beyond the RTX glycine/aspartate-rich motifs to include adjacent polypeptide sequences that might directly participate in the stabilization of the parallel β-helix fold. Construction of the CyaA-derived Proteins—DNA manipulations were performed according to standard protocols (34Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 1989; (Ed, N., ed) Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press., Cold Spring Harbor, New YorkGoogle Scholar) in the Escherichia coli XL1-Blue strain (Stratagene, Amsterdam, The Netherlands) as host cells. The plasmids pT7CACT1, coding for the acylated wild type CyaA, and pACTΔ1–1006, coding for CyaA1006–1706, the RTX domain of CyaA, have already been described (35Sebo P. Glaser P. Sakamoto H. Ullmann A. Gene (Amst.). 1991; 104: 19-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 36Osicka R. Osickova A. Basar T. Guermonprez P. Rojas M. Leclerc C. Sebo P. Infect. Immun. 2000; 68: 247-256Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 37Gmira S. Karimova G. Ladant D. Res. Microbiol. 2001; 152: 889-900Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The plasmid pTRCyaAΔ1–1006Δ1490–1706, coding for the truncated CyaA RTX domain (CyaA1006–1490), is a derivative of pTRCyaAΔ1–1006, in which the sequence coding for the last block of repeated sequences (between the SmaI and BspE1 sites) has been replaced by an appropriate synthetic double-stranded oligonucleotides encoding a termination sequence. The plasmid pTRCyaAΔ1491–1706 encoding the acylated truncated protein (CyaA1–1490) is a derivative of pTRCAG (37Gmira S. Karimova G. Ladant D. Res. Microbiol. 2001; 152: 889-900Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), in which the molecule C-terminal DNA sequence (encompassing the RTX last block of repeated sequences and the secretion signal, located between the SmaI and BamH1 sites) was deleted and replaced by an appropriate synthetic double-stranded oligonucleotide encoding an amino acid termination sequence. The plasmid pTRCyaAΔ1–1489Δ1682–1706 encoding the last block of repeated sequences and its N- and C-terminal-flanking regions (CyaA1490–1681) is a derivative of pACTΔ1–1006 (17Benz R. Maier E. Ladant D. Ullmann A. Sebo P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27231-27239Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), constructed in two steps. First, the DNA sequence coding for the N-terminal part of the CyaA RTX domain (between the NdeI and SmaI sites) was deleted and replaced by an appropriate synthetic double-stranded oligonucleotide encoding the amino acids Met-Leu-Glu-Gly; then the C-terminal DNA sequence (located between the BspE1 and BamH1 sites) was replaced by a synthetic double-stranded oligonucleotide encoding a hexahistidine tag and a termination signal (Pro-Asp-His-His-His-His-His-His-Stop). The plasmid pTRCyaAΔ1–1527Δ1613–1706 encoding the RTX last block of repeated sequences (CyaA1528–1612) was obtained by amplifying by PCR the CyaA fragment located between amino acids 1528 and 1612, using as primers two single-strand synthetic oligonucleotides (5′-GGGAATTCCATATGGGCAGCGCGCGTGATGACGTGCTGATCGGC-3′ and 5′-TCCGGTATCCGGATAGCGGATGGTGTCATCGCCGCCGCCCGATTC-3′, including in-frame NdeI and BspE1 sites, respectively). The fragment obtained was then inserted into the NdeI and BspE1 sites of pTRCyaAΔ1–1489Δ1682–1706 (see above), leading to the addition of an in-frame His tag in the C-terminal end of the CyaA1528–1612 protein. Production and Purification of the CyaA-derived Proteins—Protocol for CyaA production has already been described elsewhere (25Rose T. Sebo P. Bellalou J. Ladant D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26370-26376Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar, 38Karimova G. Fayolle C. Gmira S. Ullmann A. Leclerc C. Ladant D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Methods Enzymol. 2000; 326: 527-542Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). All proteins were expressed in E. coli BLR strains (Novagen, Merck). Wild type CyaA and CyaA1–1490 were purified to greater than 95% homogeneity (as judged by SDS-gel analysis, Fig. 2B) from inclusion bodies by a two-step procedure including DEAE-Sepharose and phenyl-Sepharose chromatography as described (38Karimova G. Fayolle C. Gmira S. Ullmann A. Leclerc C. Ladant D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 12532-12537Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 39Guermonprez P. Fayolle C. Karimova G. Ullmann A. Leclerc C. Ladant D. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 326: 527-542Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). CyaA1006–1706 and CyaA1006–1490 were purified by Ca2+-dependent phenyl-Sepharose chromatography as described previously (25Rose T. Sebo P. Bellalou J. Ladant D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26370-26376Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). The cells were disrupted by sonication in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and 2 mm CaCl2. After centrifugation (20 min at 25,000 × g at 4°C), the supernatant was loaded on a phenyl-Sepharose column equilibrated with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and 2 mm CaCl2. The column was washed extensively with the same buffer, and the proteins were eluted in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and 5 mm EDTA. CyaA1006–1706 and CyaA1006–1490 were then dialyzed against 20 mm ammonium bicarbonate, pH 7.5. CyaA1490–1681 and CyaA1528–1612 were directly purified from bacterial lysate (20 mm Hepes-Na, 50 mm NaCl, pH 7.5) on an immobilized nickel column (nickel nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose) according to the instructions of the manufacturer (Qiagen). The proteins eluted in the presence of 100 mm imidazole, pH 7.2, were then directly loaded (after dilution with 2 volumes of 20 mm Hepes-Na, pH 7.5) on a DEAE-Sepharose resin, equilibrated with 20 mm Hepes-Na, pH 7.5. After extensive washing with the 20 mm Hepes-Na, 100 mm NaCl, pH 7.5, the proteins were eluted in 20 mm Hepes-Na, 250 mm NaCl, pH 7.5, and dialyzed against 20 mm ammonium bicarbonate, pH 7.5. Protein concentrations were determined spectrophotometrically from the adsorption at 278 nm using a molecular extinction coefficient of 141 mm –1 cm–1 for the full length CyaA toxin, 132 mm –1 cm–1 for CyaA1–1490, 67 mm–1 cm–1 for CyaA1006–1706, 52.5 mm –1 cm–1 for CyaA1006–1490, 25 mm –1 cm–1 for CyaA1490–1681, and 7.2 mm –1 cm–1 for CyaA1528–1612. Assay of Hemolytic and Invasive Activities—The hemolytic and cell-invasive activities of the CyaA molecules and/or mixed CyaA fragments were characterized on sheep erythrocytes as described previously (25Rose T. Sebo P. Bellalou J. Ladant D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26370-26376Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar, 38Karimova G. Fayolle C. Gmira S. Ullmann A. Leclerc C. Ladant D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 12532-12537Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Purified proteins in 8 m urea, 20 mm Hepes-Na were directly diluted (at least 100-fold) into suspensions of sheep erythrocytes (5 × 108 cells/ml in 20 mm Hepes-Na, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm CaCl2). Adenylate cyclase activity was measured as previously described (25Rose T. Sebo P. Bellalou J. Ladant D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26370-26376Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar, 38Karimova G. Fayolle C. Gmira S. Ullmann A. Leclerc C. Ladant D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 12532-12537Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar); one unit of enzymatic activity corresponds to 1 μmol of cAMP formed/min at 30°C and pH 8.0. Membrane Experiments—Black lipid bilayer membranes were formed as described previously (17Benz R. Maier E. Ladant D. Ullmann A. Sebo P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27231-27239Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23Knapp O. Maier E. Polleichtner G. Masin J. Sebo P. Benz R. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 8077-8084Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 40Benz R. Janko K. Boos W. Lauger P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1978; 511: 305-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar). The instrumentation consisted of a Teflon chamber with two aqueous compartments connected by a small circular hole. The hole had a surface area of about 0.4 mm2. Membranes were formed across the hole by painting onto a 1% solution of asolectin (lecithin type III from soybeans from Sigma) in n-decane. The 1 m KCl solutions (Merck) were buffered with 10 mm Hepes-KOH to a pH around 7. The temperature was kept at 20°C throughout. The membrane current was measured with a pair of silver/silver chloride electrodes with salt bridges switched in series with a voltage source and an electrometer (Keithley 617). In the case of the channel recordings the electrometer was replaced by a homemade current amplifier. The amplified signal was monitored with a storage oscilloscope and recorded with a tape or a strip chart recorder. Fluorescence Spectroscopy—The fluorescence spectra were recorded at 20°C on a 2-ml sample using an LS-5B spectrofluorimeter (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The excitation wavelength was set at 292 nm with an excitation bandwidth of 5 nm, and the fluorescence emission spectra were recorded from 300 to 420 nm (emission bandwidth of 5 nm). CyaA1006–1706 and CyaA1490–1681 protein concentrations were 0.2 and 1.0 μm, respectively, in a 20 mm ammonium bicarbonate buffer, pH 8. The fluorescence emission spectra of the proteins were recorded at different calcium concentrations ranging from 0 to 2 mm. After each addition of CaCl2, a 5-min equilibrium period was allowed before recording the spectrum. Finally, EGTA was added to a final concentration of 5 mm to record the fluorescence spectra of calcium-free proteins. The background fluorescence was recorded similarly in the absence of added proteins and subtracted from all spectra. Circular Dichroism Spectroscopy—Circular dichroism spectra were recorded on a Jobin-Yvon CD6 dicrograph at 20°C with a 0.02-cm path length cylindrical suprasil quartz cell (Hellma). Protein samples were equilibrated in 20 mm ammonium bicarbonate, pH 8.0, by overnight dialysis at 4°C, and spectra were determined at a protein concentration of 0.5 mg/ml in the presence or absence of 2 mm CaCl2. Far UV region spectra represent the average of 5 successive scans between 180 and 260 nm with 0.5-nm steps using an integration time of 5 s between 180 and 200 nm and of 1 s between 200 to 260 nm. Base lines acquired on the 20 mm ammonium bicarbonate, pH 8, buffer (with or without the addition of 2 mm CaCl2) under the same conditions were subtracted, and spectra were deconvoluted using the CDSSTR program from W. C. Johnson (41Johnson W.C. Proteins. 1999; 35: 307-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (626) Google Scholar) included in the CDPro software package. Analytical Ultracentrifugation—CyaA RTX fragments were subjected to sedimentation equilibrium on a Beckman XL-A analytical ultracentrifuge equipped with standard double sector cells with 1.2-mm thick aluminum centerpieces. Protein samples were dialyzed extensively at 4°C against 50 mm Hepes-Na, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 2 mm CaCl2. Insoluble materials were removed by centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 15 min, and aliquots of CyaA1006–1706 (0.5 mg/ml; 6.95 μm) and CyaA1490–1681 (0.71 mg/ml; 31.9 μm) were then centrifuged at 20°C at 20,000 and 30,000 rpm respectively, until perfect superposition of consecutive scans (about 20 h). The final equilibrium distributions were determined from absorption measurements at 280 nm. Theoretical partial specific volumes, calculated from the amino acid composition of CyaA1006–1706 and CyaA1490–1681 were 0.717 and 0.719 ml·mg–1, respectively, and the solvent density of the Hepes/NaCl buffer was calculated to be 1.003 g ml–1 at 20°C. To calculate molecular weights, data were fitted using the Origin-based Optima XL-A data analysis software (Beckman). Different fitting models (single ideal component, two ideal components, and association of identical ideal components) for single data sets were systematically tested, and the best fit was retained on the basis of both the χ2 value and the lack of systematic deviation of the residuals. Ca2+ Binding Assay—Binding of calcium to CyaA1006–1706, CyaA1490–1681, and CyaA1528–1612 was determined by ultrafiltration, as described previously using radioactive 45Ca as a tracer (42Ladant D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3179-3185Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Purified proteins were extensively dialyzed against 20 mm Hepes-Na, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, and insoluble materials were removed by centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 15 min (42Ladant D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3179-3185Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For the binding assays, 0.2-ml samples of a 12–90 μm solution of dialyzed proteins were placed in the top compartment of Amicon Ultrafree-MC centrifugal filter devices (Millipore Corporation, Bedford, MA; molecular mass cut-off of 5000 Da). Ten μl of a 5 mm CaCl2 solution containing about 500 cpm of 45Ca/nmol of calcium were added to the protein and thoroughly mixed by vortexing. Ten μl of this solution were taken for counting of total radioactivity in a scintillation counter. The mixtures were then centrifuged at room temperature in a tabletop centrifuge for about 30 s until 10 μl were filtrated through. The ultra-filtrate was added back to the top compartment (i.e. protein solution) and again mixed and centrifuged as above (this second centrifugation was done to alleviate any dilution due to the dead-volume of the filtration membrane). Radioactivity of a 10-μl sample of the filtrate, which contained the free calcium, was determined by scintillation counting. Then 10 μl of the radioactive CaCl2 solution as well as 10 μl of the protein solution were added to the top compartment, and the whole centrifugation procedure described above was repeated. At each step the ratio radioactivity in 10 μl of filtrate/radioactivity in 10 μl of top compartment is equal to free calcium/total added calcium. This allows calculating the number of calcium ions bound per protein molecule as a function of free calcium. Limited Proteolysis—CyaA1006–1706 or CyaA1490–1681 was diluted to 1.0 mg/ml in 20 mm Hepes-Na, pH 7.5, in the presence of either 10 mm EDTA or 10 mm CaCl2. The solutions were equilibrated at 37°C, and then trypsin was added to a final concentration of 1.0 μg/ml. After 5, 10, and 30 min of incubation at 37°C, aliquots of 20 μl (20 μg of protein) were taken out from the reaction mixture, and proteolysis was stopped by the addition of 500 μm 4-(2-aminoethyl) benzene sulfonyl fluoride and SDS-gel loading buffer. The samples were stored at –20°C until analysis by gel electrophoresis. N-terminal sequencing of the proteolytic fragments (separated by SDS-PAGE, electrotransferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, and stained with Coomassie Blue) was performed on an Applied Biosystems ABI 494 sequencer at the Plate-forme de microséquencage of Institut Pasteur. Kinetic analyzes of the proteolytic cleavage of the CyaA1006–1706 or CyaA1490–1681 were carried out by recording the decay of the protein intrinsic fluorescence. CyaA1006–1706 or CyaA1490–1681 was diluted to 0.5 m and 2 μm, respectively, in 20 mm Hepes-Na, pH 7.5, containing either 10 mm EDTA or 10 mm CaCl2. The fluorescence emission intensities were recorded at 320 nm (the excitation wavelength was 292 nm with a 5-nm band pass) on a Jasco FP-750 fluorimeter thermostatted at 37°C under constant agitation. Proteolysis was initiated by the addition of 3 nm (final concentration) TPCK-treated trypsin, and the kinetics were recorded for 2000"
https://openalex.org/W2040273148,"The biological mechanisms for maintaining the basal level of p53 in normal cells require nuclear exclusion and cytoplasmic degradation. Here, we showed that Jab1 facilitates p53 nuclear exclusion and its subsequent degradation in coordination with Hdm2. p53 was excluded from the nucleus in the presence of Jab1; this exclusion was prevented by leptomycin B treatment. Nuclear export of p53 was accompanied by a decrease in the levels of p53, as well as of its target proteins, which include p21 and Bax. Domain analyses of Jab1 showed that the N-terminal domain, 1-110, was capable of inducing cytoplasmic translocation of p53. Furthermore, 110-191 was required to facilitate the degradation of p53. Neither of these mutants incorporated into the CSN complex, indicating that Jab1 could affect the levels of p53 independent of intact CSN complex. Conversely, Jab1 was incapable of translocating and degrading two p53 mutants, W23S and 6KR, neither of which could be modified by Hdm2. Moreover, Jab1 did not affect the cellular localization or protein levels of p53 in p53 and Hdm2 double-null mouse embryo fibroblasts. We further observed that the ablation of endogenous Jab1 by small interfering RNA prevented Hdm2-mediated p53 nuclear exclusion. Under stressed conditions, which could sequester Hdm2 in its inactive state, Jab1 did not affect p53. Our studies implicate that Jab1 is required to remove post-translationally modified p53 and provide a novel target for p53-related cancer therapies. The biological mechanisms for maintaining the basal level of p53 in normal cells require nuclear exclusion and cytoplasmic degradation. Here, we showed that Jab1 facilitates p53 nuclear exclusion and its subsequent degradation in coordination with Hdm2. p53 was excluded from the nucleus in the presence of Jab1; this exclusion was prevented by leptomycin B treatment. Nuclear export of p53 was accompanied by a decrease in the levels of p53, as well as of its target proteins, which include p21 and Bax. Domain analyses of Jab1 showed that the N-terminal domain, 1-110, was capable of inducing cytoplasmic translocation of p53. Furthermore, 110-191 was required to facilitate the degradation of p53. Neither of these mutants incorporated into the CSN complex, indicating that Jab1 could affect the levels of p53 independent of intact CSN complex. Conversely, Jab1 was incapable of translocating and degrading two p53 mutants, W23S and 6KR, neither of which could be modified by Hdm2. Moreover, Jab1 did not affect the cellular localization or protein levels of p53 in p53 and Hdm2 double-null mouse embryo fibroblasts. We further observed that the ablation of endogenous Jab1 by small interfering RNA prevented Hdm2-mediated p53 nuclear exclusion. Under stressed conditions, which could sequester Hdm2 in its inactive state, Jab1 did not affect p53. Our studies implicate that Jab1 is required to remove post-translationally modified p53 and provide a novel target for p53-related cancer therapies. p53, which is known as “the genome gatekeeper,” is a transcriptional factor that functions as a tumor suppressor (1Lane D.P.

Cell. 1997; 88: 323-331Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6673) Google Scholar). p53 is activated in response to various oncogenic stresses and, thus, plays a key role in cancer prevention by maintaining genomic integrity through cell cycle arrest and/or apoptotic cell death (3Vousden K.H. Lu X. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2002; 2: 594-604Crossref PubMed Scopus (2673) Google Scholar). Under normal conditions, p53 is maintained at low steady-state levels by its rapid turnover, which is mediated by ubiquitination followed by proteasome-dependent proteolysis (2Levine A.J.

Among the various E3 ubiquitin ligases of p53, which include COP1, Pirh2, p300, and Cullin complex, Hdm2 is considered to be the most essential factor in p53 homeostasis (6Querido E. Blanchette P.

Studies examining the interaction between Hdm2 and p53 have proposed several models for Hdm2-facilitated p53 ubiquitination and the subsequent fates of p53 (4O'Brate A. Giannakakou P. Drug Resist. Update. 2003; 6: 313-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). One model suggests that Hdm2 and p53 form complexes, which are subsequently shuttled into the cytoplasm and degraded (10Roth J. Dobbelstein M. Freedman D.A. Shenk T. Levine A.J. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 554-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (531) Google Scholar, 11Freedman D.A. Levine A.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 7288-7293Crossref PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar). Interestingly, Hdm2 and p53 mutants, both of which are defective in nuclear localization, also induce p53 ubiquitination and degradation, which suggests that Hdm2 can be localized to the cytoplasm independently of p53 and can induce p53 ubiquitination and degradation in the cytoplasm (12Yu Z.K. Geyer R.K. Maki C.G. Oncogene. 2000; 30: 5892-5897Crossref Scopus (91) Google Scholar). However, some reports have proposed that the nucleocytoplasmic shuttling of Hdm2 is not required for p53 cytoplasmic degradation to occur. This was based on evidence that Hdm2 mutants that are defective in cytoplasmic localization are still capable of degrading p53 (13Boyd S.D. Tsai K.Y. Jacks T. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 563-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar, 14Geyer R.K. Yu Z.K. Maki C.G. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 569-573Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). Furthermore, monoubiquitinated p53 is excluded from the nucleus without Hdm2, which suggests that the unmasking of nuclear export signals (NES) 4The abbreviations used are: NES, nuclear export signals; Jab1, Jun activation domain-binding protein 1; CSN, COP9 signalosome; JAMM, Jab1/MPN/Mov34 metalloenzyme; HA, hemagglutinin; LMB, leptomycin B; MEF, mouse embryonic fibroblast; GFP, green fluorescent protein; DAPI, 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole; WCE, whole cell extract; siRNA, small interfering RNA. 4The abbreviations used are: NES, nuclear export signals; Jab1, Jun activation domain-binding protein 1; CSN, COP9 signalosome; JAMM, Jab1/MPN/Mov34 metalloenzyme; HA, hemagglutinin; LMB, leptomycin B; MEF, mouse embryonic fibroblast; GFP, green fluorescent protein; DAPI, 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole; WCE, whole cell extract; siRNA, small interfering RNA. might lead to p53 nuclear export (15Li M.

Nature. 1995; 378: 203-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (1190) Google Scholar). However, p53 nuclear export still requires a combination of many factors including CRM1, RanGTP, and other factors (11Freedman D.A. Levine A.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 7288-7293Crossref PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar). Jun activation domain-binding protein 1 (Jab1)/CSN5 is the fifth member of the CSN complex group, and was first discovered as a transcriptional activator of c-Jun and JunD (16Claret F.X. Hibi M. Dhut S. Toda T. Karin M. Nature. 1996; 383: 453-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar). It was later found to be a regulator of various factors including p27Kip1, cyclin E, Smad family, and SCF ubiquitin ligases (17Tomoda K. Kubota Y. Kato J.Y.

Science. 2002; 298: 608-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (571) Google Scholar). In particular, the CSN complex targets p53 for its phosphorylation and facilitates its degradation via the ubiquitin system (23Bech-Otschir D. Kraft R. Huang X. Henklein P. Kapelari B. Pollmann C. Dubiel W. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 1630-1639Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). Additionally, Jab1 knock-out mice had higher p53 and p27 levels, suggesting the essential role of Jab1 in their homeostasis (24Tomoda K. Yoneda-Kato N. Fukumoto A. Yamanaka S. Kato J.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 43013-43018Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). This study showed that Jab1 is involved in p53 cytoplasmic localization, which subsequently leads to the degradation of p53. Several regulatory pathways have been proposed to control these processes. These results suggest that the maintenance of p53 homeostasis requires the presence of Jab1, which may be another useful target for p53-related cancer therapies. Plasmids—pCMV/FLAG-Jab1, pcDNA3/FLAG-HDM2, and pCMV/HDM2 were kindly provided by K. W. Kim (National University of Seoul), E. J. Choi (University of Korea), and Y. P. Zhang (University of North Carolina), respectively. pcDNA3/HA-p53W23S was a generous gift from C. G. Maki (University of Chicago). pcDNA/p53-6KR was kindly provided by D. P. Lane (University of Dundee). pcDNA/Hsp70 was used for Hsp70 expression. pcDNA3/HA-Jab1 and pCS3-MT-BX(6xMyc)/Jab1 were generated by subcloning of the EcoRI fragment from pGEX-4T-1/Jab1 into pcDNA3/HA (Invitrogen) and pCS3-MT-BX(6xMyc) (a generous gift from J. H. Ahn, Sungkyunkwan University). pcDNA3-HA/Jab1 deletion mutants, 1-110, 110-191, and 1-191, were prepared by PCR using pcDNA3-HA/Jab1 as a template and the following primers: 5′-CGGAATTCATGGCAGCTTCCGGGAGT-3′ (forward) and 5′-CCGGAATTCCTATTGAGCATTTACTCGAGT-3′ (reverse, 1-110) or 5′-CCGCTCGAGCTACTTTGGATATGTCCTAAAGG-3′ (reverse, 1-191); 5′-CCGGAATTCATGGCTGCTGCGTATGAGTAT-3′ (forward 110-191) and 5′-CGCGAATTCCTACTTTGGATATGTCCTAAAGGC-3′ (reverse 110-191). The PCR products were digested with EcoRI/XhoI or EcoRI and cloned into the corresponding sites of the plasmids of pcDNA-3/HA and pCS3-MT-BX (6xMyc). All constructs were confirmed by enzyme digestion and DNA sequence analyses. The pEGFP-C2 vector (Clontech) was used as a transfection control. Cell Culture and DNA Transfection—p53 null and p53/Mdm2 double knock-out MEFs were kindly provided by G. Lozano (University of Texas). The human cancer cell lines H1299, 293T, SK-N-SH, and U2OS, as well as the p53 null and p53/Mdm2 double knock-out MEFs, were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% penicillin/streptomycin (Invitrogen). The transient transfections were performed using the Lipofectamine Plus reagent (Invitrogen) according to the instructions of the manufacturer. Antibodies and Chemicals—Jab1 (FL-334), Mdm2 (SMP-14), p53 monoclonal (DO-1), p53 polyclonal (FL-393), HA monoclonal (F-7), HA polyclonal (Y-11), p21 polyclonal (C-19), Bax polyclonal (N-20), and GFP (FL) antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. The FLAG (M2) and actin antibodies were purchased from Sigma. Hsp70 antibody (SPA810) was purchased from Stressgen. The Alexa Fluor 488 anti-mouse and Alexa 594 anti-rabbit antibodies were obtained from Alexa. The anti-c-myc monoclonal antibody (9E10) was purchased from Roche Diagnostics. CSN1 (ab10413), CSN2 (ab10426), COPS3 (ab12321), COPS4 (ab12322), and CSN7b (ab11895) antibodies were acquired from Abcam. LLnL, MG132, leptomycin B, DAPI (4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole), propidium iodide, etoposide, and H2O2 were purchased from Sigma. Immunofluorescence Staining—The cells were plated in 6-well plates with coverslips. After transfection, the cells were fixed with a 4% paraformaldehyde solution for 15 min at 25 °C and washed. They were then permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100 in phosphate-buffered saline for 15 min. After blocking with 5% bovine serum albumin (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) in phosphate-buffered saline for 30 min, the cells were incubated with the specific primary antibody overnight at 25 °C, followed by incubation with Alexa Fluor 488 anti-mouse or Alexa 594 anti-rabbit antibodies for 1 h at 25 °C. The cells were stained with DAPI for 7 min. The slides were analyzed using confocal or immunofluorescent microscopy (Carl Zeiss Vision, LSM510, Axioskop 2, and 5203 Axiophot II, respectively). Biochemical Analyses—Immunoprecipitation and Western blot analysis were carried out as follows. At 48 h after transfection, the cells were harvested in a lysis buffer (150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% Triton X-100, 0.1% sodium deoxycholate, 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 100 × protease inhibitor mixture). WCE (whole cell extracts) were incubated with the target antibody for 2 h at 4°C. A/G beads (Roche) were added to the lysates, incubated for 2 h at 4 °C, precipitated, and washed three times in a lysis buffer. The bound proteins were dissolved in the sample buffer and resolved by SDS-PAGE. The resolved proteins were transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane (Amersham Biosciences), blotted with the primary antibody, and incubated with horseradish peroxidase anti-rabbit or anti-mouse IgG (Zymed Laboratories Inc.,) for 1 h at 25 °C. Antibody binding was detected using an ECL system (Amersham Biosciences). The luciferase activities were measured using a Dual Luciferase assay kit (Promega) according to the instructions of the manufacturer. The Renilla luciferase reporter plasmid, pRL-CMV, was used as an internal control. The levels of endogenous Jab1 were decreased using Jab1 siRNA (5′-GCUCAGAGUAUCGAUGAAA-3′) oligonucleotides with 3′-dT-dT overhangs, and were synthesized by Qiagen-Xeragon. Control siRNA in experiments refers to a mixture of scrambled siRNA oligonucleotides (Qiagen-Xeragon). The cells were transfected with 200 nm siRNA using Oligofectamine according to the instructions of the manufacturer (Invitrogen). Jab1 Induces the Nuclear Exclusion and Degradation of p53—Because Jab1 is known to be a nuclear/cytoplasmic shuttle protein and interacts with p53, the effects of Jab1 on p53 cytoplasmic localization were first examined in H1299 and U2OS cells (17Tomoda K. Kubota Y. Kato J.Y. Nature. 1999; 398: 160-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (549) Google Scholar). Approximately 80% of the p53 expressed in H1299 was localized to the nucleus, whereas Jab1 was located in both the nucleus and the cytoplasm (Fig. 1A, panels 1-4, and graph). However, ∼60% of cells simultaneously expressing p53 and Jab1 displayed both the cytoplasmic and nuclear localization of p53 (Fig. 1A, panels 5-8, graph). When leptomycin B (LMB), a CRM1 inhibitor, was added, it blocked Jab1-facilitated p53 nuclear export, which implied that this process requires the CRM1-dependent pathway (Fig. 1A, panels 9-12) (11Freedman D.A. Levine A.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 7288-7293Crossref PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar). It has been established that endogenous p53 is mainly expressed in the nuclei of U2OS cells (Fig. 1B, panels 1 and 2) (13Boyd S.D. Tsai K.Y. Jacks T. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 563-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar, 14Geyer R.K. Yu Z.K. Maki C.G. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 569-573Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). Upon overexpression of Jab1, there was a significant reduction in p53 levels in the nuclei of 85% of cells expressing exogenous Jab1 (Fig. 1B, panels 5-7). This reduction was completely blocked by LMB (Fig. 1B, panels 8-10). These observations suggest that Jab1 might facilitate p53 nuclear exclusion and degradation. When the biochemical effects of Jab1 on the stability of p53 were tested, we observed that the overexpression of Jab1 induced a reduction in the levels of exogenous p53 in H1299 (Fig. 2A). Consistent with these findings, exogenous Jab1 also decreased the level of p21 and Bax, both target proteins of p53 (Fig. 2B). It also suppressed the p53-dependent activation of synthetic reporter genes, including p21Waf1, Bax, and PG13 (Fig. 2C). Moreover, Jab1 facilitated the degradation of endogenous p53, which was blocked in the presence of MG132, a proteasome inhibitor (Fig. 2D). Because Jab1 has been implicated in several transcriptional activities as a cofactor, we tested whether the exogenous Jab1 might affect the mRNA levels of p53 (16Claret F.X. Hibi M. Dhut S. Toda T. Karin M. Nature. 1996; 383: 453-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar, 17Tomoda K. Kubota Y. Kato J.Y. Nature. 1999; 398: 160-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (549) Google Scholar, 19Kim B.C. Lee H.J. Park S.H. Lee S.R. Karpova T.S. McNally J.G. Felici A. Lee D.K. Kim S.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 2251-2262Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). When we performed reverse transcriptase-PCR using p53 or glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase primers, mRNA levels of p53 were not affected by Jab1 (Fig. 2D, lanes 1 and 2). These data imply that Jab1 promoted p53 degradation via the 26 S proteasome-mediated pathway. Because our data implies that the degradation process of p53 is accelerated in the presence of Jab1, we further examined whether the ablation of endogenous Jab1 affects the homeostasis of p53 in U2OS cells. The sequence of Jab1 siRNA used in this study has been reported previously (19Kim B.C. Lee H.J. Park S.H. Lee S.R. Karpova T.S. McNally J.G. Felici A. Lee D.K. Kim S.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 2251-2262Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). The treatment of Jab1 siRNA decreased endogenous Jab1 by 90%. The ablation of endogenous Jab1 was accompanied by an increase of ∼10-fold in the p53 levels within 72 h (Fig. 2E, lanes 1 and 2). Taken together, these results imply that Jab1 may promote CRM1-dependent nuclear exclusion and the subsequent cytoplasmic degradation of p53 in the 26 S proteasome-dependent pathway. The N-terminal Domain of Jab1 Is Required for the Translocation and Degradation of p53—The direct interaction between p53 and Jab1 has been reported previously, and we confirmed the data using purified recombinant p53 and Jab1 proteins (data not shown) (22Cope G.A. Suh G.S. Aravind L. Schwarz S.E. Zipursky S.L. Koonin E.V. Deshaies R.J. Science. 2002; 298: 608-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (571) Google Scholar). We further examined the region of Jab1, which is responsible for p53 interaction, nuclear export, and degradation using 6xMyc-tagged wild-type Jab1 or its deletion mutants, 1-110, 1-191, and 110-191 (Fig. 3A). The mutants were constructed according to their abilities to be expressed in mammalian cells. The immunoprecipitation assays were carried out in the presence of MG132 to inhibit Jab1-facilitated degradation of p53. Immunoprecipitation data indicated that Jab1 and its deletion mutants, 1-110 and 1-191, bind to p53, whereas 110-191 did not (Fig. 3, B and C). This finding suggests that the 1-110 mutant is responsible for the physical interaction of Jab1 with p53 (22Cope G.A. Suh G.S. Aravind L. Schwarz S.E. Zipursky S.L. Koonin E.V. Deshaies R.J. Science. 2002; 298: 608-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (571) Google Scholar). Furthermore, 1-110 and 1-191 mutants were capable of inducing the nuclear export of p53, whereas the 110-191 did not have any effect (Fig. 3D, panels 5-16). Finally, Jab1 and 1-191, which contained an intact Jab1/MPN/Mov34 metalloenzyme motif (JAMM), were able to induce p53 degradation (Fig. 3E, lanes 2 and 4) (22Cope G.A. Suh G.S. Aravind L. Schwarz S.E. Zipursky S.L. Koonin E.V. Deshaies R.J. Science. 2002; 298: 608-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (571) Google Scholar, 25Verma R. Aravind L. Oania R. McDonald W.H. Yates J.R. Koonin E.V. Deshaies R.J. Science. 2002; 298: 611-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (823) Google Scholar). This indicates that Jab1 contains two regions, one responsible for p53 interaction and nuclear exclusion, and another required for facilitating the degradation of p53. Because Jab1 is one of the CSN complex, we examined whether intact CSN complex are required for Jab1-mediated regulatory networks on p53 (23Bech-Otschir D. Kraft R. Huang X. Henklein P. Kapelari B. Pollmann C. Dubiel W. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 1630-1639Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). When immunoprecipitation assays were performed using Jab1 or its mutants, 1-110 or 1-191, we observed that, unlike Jab1, which bound to endogenous CSN1, 2, 3, 4, and 7b, the 1-110 and 1-191 deletion mutants did not interact with these CSN subunits. These findings suggest that the C-terminal region of Jab1 might be required for its association with other CSN subunits (Fig. 3F). Overall, the N-terminal domain of Jab1, 1-110, is responsible for the nuclear export of p53, whereas the domain including the intact JAMM domain is needed for p53 degradation. Additionally, it is likely that the Jab1-mediated translocation and degradation of p53 could be carried out independently of intact CSN complex. Hdm2 Is Required for Jab1-facilitated Nuclear Exclusion and Degradation of p53—Because Hdm2 is known to be involved in the translocation and degradation of p53, we examined whether Jab1, which exhibits a similar outcome as that of Hdm2, could affect p53 independent of Hdm2 (4O'Brate A. Giannakakou P. Drug Resist. Update. 2003; 6: 313-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). For this, we employed two p53 mutants, W23S and 6KR, which retain intact p53 transcriptional activities (26Inoue T. Geyer R.K. Howard D. Yu Z.K. Maki C.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 45255-45260Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 27Xirodimas D.P. Saville M.K. Bourdon J.C. Hay R.T. Lane D.P. Cell. 2004; 118: 83-97Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar). W23S lost its ability to bind to Hdm2, whereas 6KR cannot be ubiquitinated by Hdm2 because all of its lysine sites are changed to arginine. Immunoprecipitation analysis showed that Jab1 could interact with both W23S and 6KR (Fig. 4A). Conversely, immunofluorescent and biochemical analyses showed that Jab1 was incapable of translocating or degrading W23S and 6KR, which suggested that the post-translational modification of p53 by Hdm2 might be required in these processes (Fig. 4, B and C). The effect of Hdm2 on the function of Jab1 was further identified using p53 null or p53/Mdm2 (mouse Hdm2) double knock-out mouse embryo fibroblasts (MEFs) (28Montes de Oca Luna R. Wagner D.S. Lozano G. Nature. 1995; 378: 203-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (1190) Google Scholar). Whereas Jab1 was capable of inducing p53 nuclear export and degradation in p53 null MEFs, it had no effect on the cellular localization or degradation of p53 in p53/Mdm2 double-null cells (Fig. 5, A, panels 3-5 and 8-10, B, and C). Hdm2, on the other hand, was able to induce p53 nuclear export in both MEF cell types, as previously reported (Fig. 5, A, panels 11-13 and 16-18, B and C) (29Stommel J.M. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1660-1672Crossref PubMed Scopus (597) Google Scholar). The requirement of Hdm2 for Jab1-mediated p53 nuclear export and degradation prompted us to question whether Jab1 is also required for Hdm2-mediated p53 nuclear exclusion. Using Jab1-specific siRNA as described above, we observed that the endogenous levels of Jab1 were suppressed by 90% in H1299 cells (Fig. 6A). Approximately 70% of cells expressing both exogenous p53 and Hdm2 showed the nuclear/cytoplasmic distribution of p53, whereas the remainder showed nuclear localization (Fig. 6, B, panels 5-8, and C) (12Yu Z.K. Geyer R.K. Maki C.G. Oncogene. 2000; 30: 5892-5897Crossref Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Conversely, the exogenous p53, which was co-expressed with Hdm2, was primarily located in the nucleus when Jab1 was ablated (Fig. 6, B, panels 9-12, and C). Using Hsp70, which is translocated into the cytoplasm by CRM1 independently of Hdm2, we further tested whether the ablation of Jab1 could affect the CRM1-mediated cellular localization of Hsp70 (30Rodríguez J.A. Henderson B.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 38589-38596Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). The results showed that the ablation of Jab1 did not have any effect on the subcellular localization of exogenous Hsp70, whereas ∼70% of p53 was located in the nucleus in the presence of Hdm2 as described above (Fig. 6, D and E, data not shown). These data suggest the specific role of Jab1 in p53 localization in coordination with Hdm2. Overall, Jab1-facilitated p53 nuclear exclusion and degradation require the post-translational modification of p53 by Hdm2. More specifically, the binding of Jab1 to W23S or 6KR is not enough to induce p53 nuclear exclusion and degradation, which suggests that the Hdm2-mediated ubiquitination of p53 is required. Furthermore, Hdm2-mediated p53 nuclear export was not accomplished in the absence of Jab1, which indicated that Jab1 could play an essential role in the export of p53 into the cytoplasm. Jab1-facilited p53 Nuclear Export and Degradation Are Prevented under Stressed Conditions—We further examined what would happen to the Jab1-mediated p53 degradation pathway when the function of Hdm2 was inhibited by genotoxic stresses (31Oren M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36031-36034Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar, 32Weber J.D. Taylor L.J. Roussel M.F. Sherr C.J. Bar-Sagi D. Nat.

It has been previously reported that Hdm2 is sequestered into the nucleolus by p14Arf or promyelocytic leukemia nuclear bodies under stressed conditions (32Weber J.D. Taylor L.J. Roussel M.F. Sherr C.J. Bar-Sagi D. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 20-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (790) Google Scholar, 33Kurki S. Latonen L. Laiho M. J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 3917-3925Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 34Bernardi R. Scagolini P.P. Bergmann S. Horn H.F. Vousden K.H. Pandolfi P.P. Nat. Cell Biol. 2004; 6: 665-672Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). Because genotoxic stresses negatively regulate the function of Hdm2, we expected that Jab1 might not have any effect on p53 nuclear export or degradation. As previously shown, the expression of Jab1 in the presence of p53 in H1299 and U2OS cells induced cytoplasmic localization and degradation of p53, respectively (Fig. 7, A, panels 1-3 and 10-12, and B, lanes 1 and 2). However, when treated with etoposide or H2O2, Jab1-mediated p53 nuclear export and degradation were inhibited in both cell lines, indicating that active Hdm2 might be required in this process (Fig. 7, A, panels 4-9 and 13-18, and B, lanes 3-6). Recent studies have indicated that the levels of ubiquitination by Hdm2 are closely related to the nuclear or cytoplasmic localization of p53 (15Li M. Brooks C.L. Wu-Baerm F. Chen D. Baer R. Gu W. Science. 2003; 302: 1972-1975Crossref PubMed Scopus (623) Google Scholar). However, the regulatory mechanisms bridging the ubiquitination and nuclear export of p53 have not been fully addressed yet. This report suggests that p53 ubiquitination and its subsequent nuclear export and degradation might require the accessibility of p53 to Jab1 in addition to Hdm2. The Jab1-facilitated mechanism, however, requires several essential steps. First of all, the ubiquitination of p53 by Hdm2 appears to be a prerequisite for Jab1-promoted p53 nuclear exclusion. For example, the nuclear localization and degradation of the p53 mutants, W23S and 6KR, which could be neither ubiquitinated nor degraded by Hdm2, were not influenced by Jab1 (Fig. 4). Furthermore, Jab1 was unable to induce translocation and degradation of p53 in the absence of Hdm2 (Fig. 5). It seems that the interaction between p53 and Hdm2 preceding Jab1 would allow for the ubiquitination of p53, which would expose the nuclear export signal for subsequent subcellular translocation in a Jab1- and CRM1-dependent manner (Fig. 1) (29Stommel J.M. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1660-1672Crossref PubMed Scopus (597) Google Scholar). Furthermore, our results suggest that a CSN complex-independent function of Jab1 might be associated with the nuclear exclusion of p53. This was highlighted by the two Jab1 mutants, 1-110 and 1-191, which did not associate with the intact CSN complex, but were capable of binding to p53 and inducing its cytoplasmic localization. Notably, it was observed that the Jab1 deletion mutant, 1-191, which contained the JAMM motif, could induce p53 nuclear export and subsequent degradation in the same manner as the Jab1 wild-type, whereas 1-110 was only able to carry out the latter function. The JAMM motif is also found in RPN11 (regulatory particle number 11), a subunit of the 26 S proteasome that is involved in the ATP-dependent degradation of ubiquitinated substrates (25Verma R. Aravind L. Oania R. McDonald W.H. Yates J.R. Koonin E.V. Deshaies R.J. Science. 2002; 298: 611-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (823) Google Scholar). More specifically, this motif has been known to participate in the regulatory mechanisms of ubiquitination and neddylation (25Verma R. Aravind L. Oania R. McDonald W.H. Yates J.R. Koonin E.V. Deshaies R.J. Science. 2002; 298: 611-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (823) Google Scholar). Thus, it appears that the JAMM motif plays an essential role in p53 degradation. However, it is not yet clear whether other co-factors that connect Jab1 and its substrates to the 26 S proteasome complex are required. It has been previously suggested that Jab1 connects p27 to CRM1 to facilitate p27 nuclear export (35Tomoda K. Kubota Y. Arata Y. Mori S. Maeda M. Tanaka D. Yoshida M. Yoneda-Kato N. Kato J.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 2302-2310Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). It is quite possible that Jab1 would function in a similar way for p53 as for p27. The presence of Jab1 induced the nuclear export and the subsequent cytoplasmic degradation of both proteins. However, several different regulatory pathways may exist that are involved in Jab1-mediated cytoplasmic translocation of p27 and p53. p27 does not have a NES, whereas p53 has its own. It has been suggested that Jab1 would provide p27 with the NES through direct interaction, which is required for CRM1 interaction and, thus, subsequent nuclear export of p27 (17Tomoda K. Kubota Y. Kato J.Y. Nature. 1999; 398: 160-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (549) Google Scholar, 35Tomoda K. Kubota Y. Arata Y. Mori S. Maeda M. Tanaka D. Yoshida M. Yoneda-Kato N. Kato J.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 2302-2310Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). This was further demonstrated by the use of a Jab1 mutant lacking NES, which inhibited Jab1-mediated nuclear export of p27 (35Tomoda K. Kubota Y. Arata Y. Mori S. Maeda M. Tanaka D. Yoshida M. Yoneda-Kato N. Kato J.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 2302-2310Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). On the other hand, our data indicated that the Jab1 mutant lacking NES (1-191) was still able to induce p53 localization (Fig. 3). These observations imply that the p53 NES is required for Jab1-mediated nuclear export to occur. In fact, a p53 mutant lacking NES was not translocated into the cytoplasm in the presence of Jab1 (data not shown). It is likely that the formation of a Jab1 and p53 complex might help to induce the exposure of the p53 NES to CRM1, which would accelerate the subsequent cytoplasmic translocation. Another possibility is that Jab1 functions as an adaptor that links CRM1 and p53 and positively increases the specificity of CRM1 toward p53. This process seems to be specific for p53, because Hsc70, which is also translocated into the cytoplasm by CRM1, was not affected by the ablation of Jab1 (Fig. 6) (30Rodríguez J.A. Henderson B.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 38589-38596Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). However, it is still unclear how Jab1 might be directly involved in accelerating the translocation of p53 into the cytoplasm in a CRM1-dependent manner; further studies are required. Moreover, as Jab1-dependent p53 translocation requires the ubiquitination of p53 by Hdm2, it seems that the p53 nuclear export pathway can be seen as an extra regulatory pathway compared with that of p27. What happens when cellular stresses occur? If DNA damage were to take place, the regulatory function of Hdm2 on p53 would be prevented during the early stages of the stresses, possibly through post-translational phosphorylation of both proteins and Hdm2 sequestration in the nucleolus by p14Arf or in the promyelocytic leukemia nuclear bodies bodies (32Weber J.D. Taylor L.J. Roussel M.F. Sherr C.J. Bar-Sagi D. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 20-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (790) Google Scholar, 33Kurki S. Latonen L. Laiho M. J.

Cell Biol. 2004; 6: 665-672Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). These inhibitions prevent the ubiquitination and subsequent degradation of p53. Consistently, the oncogenic stresses, which could damage DNA, prevented Jab1-mediated nuclear export and subsequent cytoplasmic degradation of p53 (Fig. 7). The inhibition of Hdm2 seems to prevent the modification of p53, a process that is essential for Jab1-mediated p53 nuclear exclusion and degradation (Fig. 5). However, we were not able to completely exclude the possibility that stress-induced post-translational modifications of Jab1 occur; this would inactivate the regulatory effects of Jab1 on p53. Clinically, the overexpression of Jab1 in vivo has been implicated in various cancers, including those in the lung, pancreas, mouth, thyroid, breast, pituitary, ovary, and brain (36Goto A. Niki T.

Furthermore, the recent reports on Jab1-knock-out mice, which were embryonically lethal, showed increased p27 and p53 levels in the embryonic cells, which further supported our results (24Tomoda K. Yoneda-Kato N. Fukumoto A. Yamanaka S. Kato J.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 43013-43018Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Therefore, Jab1 might function as a proto-oncogenic protein, the overexpression of which would negatively affect p53 and p27, either by reducing their levels or by removing them from the areas where their main regulatory functions are performed. Thus, Jab1 might be a novel target molecule in the development of drugs for the treatment of tumors that have erupted through disruptions of endogenous p53 homeostasis or through abnormal subcellular localization of p53."

It mediates shear-dependent bacterial binding to monomannose (1M)-coated surfaces manifested by the existence of a shear threshold for binding, below which bacteria do not adhere. The 1M-specific shear-dependent binding of FimH is consistent with so-called catch bond interactions, whose lifetime is increased by tensile force. We show here that the oligosaccharide-specific interaction of FimH with another of its ligands, trimannose (3M), lacks a shear threshold for binding, since the number of bacteria binding under static conditions is higher than under any flow. However, similar to 1M, the binding strength of surface-interacting bacteria is enhanced by shear. Bacteria transition from rolling into firm stationary surface adhesion as the shear increases. The shear-enhanced bacterial binding on 3M is mediated by catch bond properties of the 1M-binding subsite within the extended oligosaccharide-binding pocket of FimH, since structural mutations in the putative force-responsive region and in the binding site affect 1M- and 3M-specific binding in an identical manner.

A shear-dependent conversion of the adhesion mode is also exhibited by P-fimbriated E. coli adhering to digalactose surfaces. Bacterial adhesion, a critical initial step in colonization and biofilm formation, is commonly mediated by carbohydrate-binding lectin-like proteins expressed on the bacterial surface as part of hair-like fimbrial appendages or as nonfimbrial components (1Ofek I. Sharon N. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 1990; 151: 91-113PubMed Google Scholar, 2Karlsson K.A. Angstrom J. Bergstrom J. Lanne B. APMIS Suppl. 1992; 27: 71-83PubMed Google Scholar, 3Edwards R.A.

Microbiol. 2000; 290: 27-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). Lectins are a structurally diverse class of receptor proteins that bind monosaccharide or, more commonly, oligosaccharide ligands in a noncovalent and nonenzymatic fashion (5Sharon N. Lis H. Science. 1989; 246: 227-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (1079) Google Scholar). In general, receptor-ligand interactions (including lectin-saccharide binding) are thought to occur via slip bonds, where the strength of the binding is highest under no tensile force (6Bell G.I. Science. 1978; 200: 618-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (3449) Google Scholar, 7Evans E. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 2001; 30: 105-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (1103) Google Scholar). Thus, the surface adhesion of eukaryotic or bacterial cells is expected to be strongest and have the highest level of surface accumulation at the lowest shear stress. However, several studies have demonstrated shear-enhanced bacterial and cell adhesion where surface binding under static or low shear conditions is too weak to mediate adhesion of whole cells but becomes significantly stronger at increased shears, resulting in dramatically higher surface accumulation of cells at elevated shear stresses (i.e. a shear threshold for surface adhesion is seen). This has been shown for von Willebrand-mediated adhesion of platelets (8Savage B. Saldivar E. Ruggeri Z.M.

It has been suggested that shear thresholds for binding could result by forming not slip bonds but catch bonds whose lifetime is increased by flow-induced tensile forces (14Dembo M. Torney D.

Type 1 fimbriae are the most common type of adhesive organelles in E. coli and other enterobacteria and mediate mannose-specific adhesion via the fimbrial tip-associated lectin-like subunit FimH (30 kDa). FimH is a two-domain protein consisting of the mannose-binding lectin domain and the fimbria-incorporating pilin domain. On the top of the lectin domain, distal from the pilin domain, is the ligand-binding pocket that accommodates a 1M 3The abbreviations used are: 1M, monomannose; 3M, trimannose; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; BSA, bovine serum albumin; RB, RNase B; pN, piconewtons. αMM, methyl-α-d-mannopyranoside. residue (18Hung C.S.

The ability of FimH to bind to 1M under static, no-flow conditions is a highly variable property. E. coli binding to 1M via most common naturally occurring FimH variants (especially ones originating in intestinal E. coli isolates) is very low. In contrast, adhesion of uropathogenic E. coli (primarily those causing pyelonephritis) is commonly mediated by the FimH variants that carry point structural mutations enabling them to bind relatively well to 1M in static assays (19Sokurenko E.V. Chesnokova V. Doyle R.J. Hasty D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17880-17886Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 20Sokurenko E. Chsenokova V. Dykhuizen D. Ofek K. Wu X. Krogfelt K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 8922-8926Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). When mediated by FimH, E. coli adhesion to 1M-BSA surfaces is dramatically enhanced under flow conditions (after shear stress reaches a certain level) compared with static conditions (16Thomas W.E. Nilsson L.M. Forero M. Sokurenko E.V. Vogel V. Mol. Microbiol. 2004; 53: 1545-1557Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). Thus, binding to 1M is enhanced by shear and requires shear threshold for adhesion to occur. Using steered molecular dynamics simulations and site-directed mutagenesis of FimH, we have shown that the affinity to 1M is probably enhanced by the tensile force-induced extension of a 3-amino acid linker chain between the two domains of FimH, distal from the mannose-binding site (13Thomas W.E. Trintchina E. Forero M. Vogel V. Sokurenko E.V. Cell. 2002; 109: 913-923Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar). Whereas most variants of FimH bind only weakly to 1M substrates in static conditions, all natural FimH variants exhibit strong oligosaccharide-specific binding to 3M already in the absence of flow that is up to 20 times higher than the binding to 1M (19Sokurenko E.V.

Kjaergaard K. Hasty D.L. Klemm P. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 41: 675-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). This is thought to be due to the presence of an extended FimH binding pocket with multiple subsites corresponding to the size of a trimannose (3M) and, possibly, pentasaccharide (22Sharon N. FEBS Lett. 1987; 217: 145-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar, 23Rockendorf N. Sperling O. Lindhorst T.K. Aust. J. Chem. 2002; 55: 87-93Crossref Google Scholar, 24Lindhorst T.K. Kieburg C. Krallmann-Wenzel U. Glycoconj. J. 1998; 15: 605-613Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Indeed, although some lectins are capable of binding simple monosaccharides, it is rather typical for lectins to bind specifically to complex oligosaccharide ligands that ensure high affinity and specificity for cell-cell or cell-surface interactions (25Rini J.M. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 1995; 24: 551-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar). We show here that the number of E. coli binding to 3M surfaces lacks a shear threshold (i.e. is both high and maximal at the lowest shear). Despite this, the surface adhesion strength of individual bacteria on 3M was still enhanced by shear stress; at low shear, bacteria rolled along the surface, but as the shear was increased, the bacteria stopped and adhered firmly. Thus, we show here that, in analogy to FimH-1M, the lifetime of the FimH-3M complex can also probably be switched by force from short to long lived. Finally, shear-enhanced adhesion independent of FimH, but without a binding shear threshold, is demonstrated by E. coli expressing the P fimbrial adhesin PapG, a bacterial adhesin that binds specifically to digalactose. Bacterial Strains—Recombinant bacterial strains expressing naturally occurred and mutant FimH variants were constructed as described previously (13Thomas W.E. Trintchina E. Forero M. Vogel V. Sokurenko E.V. Cell. 2002; 109: 913-923Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar). E. coli expressing FimH from model fecal isolate F18 (with a low 1M binding ability under static conditions) were used for all FimH experiments except those testing the effect of point mutations (Figs. 5 and 6), where FimH from a model uropathogenic isolate J96 (with a moderate 1M binding under static conditions) was used. A recombinant P-fimbriated strain of E. coli G1122 was provided by Dr. Steve Moseley (University of Washington, Seattle, WA). Bacteria were grown overnight in SB broth (type 1 fimbriated and nonfimbriated background strain AAEC191A) or on LB agar (P-fimbriated) with appropriate antibiotics, washed twice in PBS, and brought to 108 colony-forming units/ml in PBS containing 0.2% BSA (PBS-BSA). For trials with the P-fimbriated strain, 2% methyl-α-d-mannopyranoside was also added in order to inhibit any potential mannose-specific interactions.FIGURE 6The effect of 1M-binding site mutations on bacterial adhesion under static and under fluid flow conditions.

Johnson, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN). Incubation was followed by quenching with PBS-BSA. Unless otherwise noted, 2 μg/ml RNase B was used for 3M experiments, since this resulted in a similar peak number of bacteria adhered as on 200 μg/ml 1M-BSA. In order to increase adhesion, 20 μg/ml RNase B was used for both static and flow trials of the pocket mutant strains. Parallel Plate Flow Chamber Setup—All experiments were performed at room temperature in PBS-BSA buffer. The protein-coated dishes formed the bottom of a 2.5 cm (length) × 0.25 cm (width) × 250 μm (height) parallel plate flow chamber (GlycoTech). One or more Harvard Apparatus or Warner Instruments syringe pumps set at various flow rates were used to produce various wall shear stresses at the flow chamber wall. The bound bacteria were recorded using a Nikon TE200 or a Nikon Diaphot inverted microscope with a 10× phase-contrast objective, a Roper Scientific high resolution CCD Cascade camera, and MetaMorph® or MetaView® (Universal Imaging Corp.™) video acquisition software or with a Nikon TE2000-E microscope, Hamamatsu Photonics EM CCD-C9100 camera, and SimplePCI video acquisition software (C-Imaging Systems). The field of view was 500 × 370 μm with a resolution of 0.77 μm/pixel for the cascade camera, whereas for the Hamamatsu camera, 50–60% larger fields of views where used, and results were subsequently normalized for the smaller cascade field of view, which was predominantly used. The bound bacteria were recorded in time lapse digital videos. The camera shutter was held open for a time that depended upon the shear rate so that free-floating bacteria were blurred out, whereas surface-interacting bacteria could be clearly visualized, as previously described (16Thomas W.E. Nilsson L.M. Forero M. Sokurenko E.V. Vogel V. Mol. Microbiol. 2004; 53: 1545-1557Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). In any given experiment, less than 2% of the surface area was covered by bacteria, so that any interactions between bacteria were minimal. Images were acquired every 0.5–2 s, depending on the experiment. Analyzing the Bacterial Adhesion in Time Lapse Videos—The digital videos were analyzed using MetaMorph® and MetaView™ Imaging System (some additional manual counting was done with SimplePCI). To count bound bacteria, we manually determined an intensity threshold that correctly distinguished the bacteria from the background and used the automated cell counting package in MetaMorph®. To measure the level of bacterial adhesion (accumulation, i.e. the overall number of surface-bound bacteria), we counted the number of bacteria adhered to the surfaces after allowing bacteria to flow over the noted surface for 5 min at the given shear. Type 1 fimbriated bacteria were defined as rolling if they moved at least one-half bacterial diameter (roughly 2 pixels) over 20 s, since rolling bacteria should move at least 2 μm on 3M surfaces in this time (supplemental Fig. S1). For P-fimbriated bacteria, rolling is shown (Fig. 8) with a 1-s rather than 20-s definition or rolling, to reflect the faster bacterial movement on pigeon ovalbumin compared with 3M. The number of rolling (and, to a lesser extent, detaching) bacteria at a given time was identified by subtracting the intensity values in each pixel in the second image from the first; the stationary bacteria then blended in with the gray background, whereas the rolling bacteria appeared as a pair of dark and light spots, which were counted using a threshold and either the automated or manual object counting package. The rest of the bound bacteria were then assumed to be firm. In Figs. 3 and 5, the fraction firm was determined by examining the last 20 s of the 5-min accumulation videos, described above. When examining the movement of bacteria expressing FimH pocket 1M mutants, the fraction firm bacteria was determined over a 15-min time interval (rather than 20 s as above) to show the nearly complete lack of movement of the parent strain and the Y137A mutant and to ensure that also slow bacterial movement was captured. For both 0.15- and 1.5-pN/μm2 runs, bacteria were first loaded at 0.15 pN/μm2 before the flow was switched to a buffer stream set at the appropriate shear and the 15 min experiment was started. Since the mutant strains Y137A and D141A adhered at much lower numbers than the parent strain and the D140A strain, they were loaded at a concentration of 109 colony-forming units/ml rather than the normal 108 colony-forming units/ml. Static Adhesion Assay—The bacterial binding level under static conditions was determined as described previously (13Thomas W.E. Trintchina E. Forero M. Vogel V. Sokurenko E.V. Cell. 2002; 109: 913-923Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar). Statistical Analysis—When the number of attachments or accumulated bacteria was measured, the exact 95% confidence intervals for a Poisson variable were used. When instead a fraction was measured, the exact 95% confidence intervals for a binomial variable were used. Shear Stress Does Not Enhance Accumulation of E. coli on Surfaces Coated with a 3M Ligand—We tested the ability of bacteria that expressed a shear-enhanced 1M-binding FimH phenotype (from E. coli strain F18) to adhere under flow conditions to surfaces coated with bovine RNase B, a model ligand containing N-linked high mannose type with terminally exposed 3M structures (3M-RB) (26Fu D.T. Chen L. Oneill R.A. Carbohydrate Res. 1994; 261: 173-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). In contrast to adhesion to 1M-BSA (Fig. 1A), shear stress did not cause any significant increase in accumulation of E. coli on surfaces coated with 3M-RB (Fig. 1B). The bacteria adhered readily on the 3M surfaces at the lowest shears tested, and accumulation decreased with increased shear (occasional small increases in accumulation were not statistically significant). This pattern of adhesion did not change when the coating concentration of 3M-RB was reduced from 100 (RB100) to 2 μg/ml (RB2), although an almost 3-fold reduction in binding resulted at the lower shears (Fig. 1B). At both concentrations of 3M-RB, a sharp decline in bacterial accumulation started at 0.2–0.5 pN/μm2, a shear at which binding to 1M-BSA was not inhibited but enhanced (Fig. 1A). At a 3M-RB-coating concentration of 0.2 μg/ml (RB0.2), less than two bacteria attached per min, similar to nonspecific adhesion levels to BSA. Adhesion to both 1M (16Thomas W.E. Nilsson L.M. Forero M. Sokurenko E.V. Vogel V. Mol. Microbiol. 2004; 53: 1545-1557Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar) and 3M (Fig. 1B) was inhibited by the addition of soluble methyl-α-d-mannopyranoside (αMM) to the bacterial solution. Similarly, E. coli lacking the type 1 fimbrial plasmids were unable to adhere to the RB substrate (control strain AAEC191A; Fig. 1B). E. coli adhesion to the RB surface was thus specific to the FimH-mannose interaction. Thus, oligosaccharide-specific binding of FimH to 3M does not require a shear threshold (i.e. it is high and maximal under the lowest shear), which is in contrast to the shear-enhanced 1M-specific binding of FimH. Differences in 1M- and 3M-specific Accumulation under Shear Are Due to Differences in Both Attachment and Detachment Rates—We next determined whether 3M- and 1M-specific binding differ in the initial attachment rate or in the adhesion lifetime at different shears. The rate of initial E. coli interactions with the 1M and 3M surfaces was determined from accumulation videos, where images were collected twice/s. Shear stress inhibited initial attachments on both 3M-RB2 (Fig. 2A, ▴) and 1M-BSA (▪) but with a sharper decline in initial attachments on 3M compared with 1M. This indicates a slower on-rate of 3M-specific compared with 1M-specific adhesion under the test conditions. We next examined the proportion of surface-interacting bacteria that remained bound only transiently (for less than 1 s). On the 1M-BSA-coated surface, 83% of E. coli surface interactions were transient at the low shears, and longer term interactions dominated only above 0.05 pN/μm2 (Fig. 2B, ▴). The shear-induced transition from transient to longer term surface interaction (with a relatively slow decline of the on-rate with increased shear) was the main cause of the shear-increased bacterial accumulation on 1M-BSA. In contrast to 1M-BSA, over the same shear range, transient adhesion on the 3M-RB-coated surface remained relatively constant and at only 3–13% of total adhesion events, demonstrating a lower bacterial surface off-rate for 3M-than for 1M-specific FimH adhesion (Fig. 2B, ▪). Thus, the low bacterial detachment rate over a broad shear range combined with a sharp drop in on-rate under shear increase was responsible for the decreased accumulation of bacteria under shear observed on the 3M-RB surfaces. Increased Shear Stress Results in a Transition from Rolling to Stationary E. coli Adhesion—The shear-enhanced adhesion mediated by FimH-3M bonds can be seen when examining the adhesion mode of already adherent bacteria. When FimH-expressing E. coli do adhere to 1M-BSA, they exhibit two adhesion modes: firm stationary binding and weak rolling adhesion, as shown previously (16Thomas W.E. Nilsson L.M. Forero M. Sokurenko E.V. Vogel V. Mol. Microbiol. 2004; 53: 1545-1557Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). In the latter mode, bacteria move along the surface at speeds significantly slower than the near surface fluid velocity. The rolling mode dominates at lower shears, but bacteria convert into stationary adhesion if the shear is increased (i.e. E. coli exhibits shear-dependent “stick-and-roll” adhesion on 1M (16Thomas W.E. Nilsson L.M. Forero M. Sokurenko E.V. Vogel V. Mol. Microbiol. 2004; 53: 1545-1557Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar)) (Fig. 3A). To see if a shear-induced stick-and-roll transition from rolling to stationary adhesion could be seen on 3M, we determined the fraction of bacteria that were stationary (as opposed to rolling or, occasionally, detaching) across the shear spectrum. Bacteria were defined as stationary if they moved less than one-half cell diameter over the last 20 s of accumulation experiments. Within a lower shear stress range (0.01–0.1 pN/μm2), about 60 and 30% of surface-attached bacteria adhered firmly (Fig. 3B) on surfaces coated with 200 μg/ml (3M-RB200) and 2 μg/ml 3M-RB (3M-RB2), respectively. Within an intermediate shear range (0.1–1.0 pN/μm2), bacteria increasingly adhered in a firm mode on both 3M surfaces, and almost all bacteria were stationary at high shears (1.0–4.3 pN/μm2). Whereas bacteria rolled along the surface at intermediate shears and transitioned into firm adhesion as the flow was increased on both 1M-BSA and 3M-RB, they rolled significantly slower on 3M than on 1M. On 1M-BSA, rolling velocities averaged 5–20 μm/s, compared with averages of 0.1–0.4 μm/s on 3M-RB at 0.37 pN/μm2, despite a 100-fold lower 3M-RB than 1M-BSA concentration being used to prepare the surfaces (supplemental Fig. S1). Similarly, the stationary mode of bacterial adhesion was weaker on 1M than 3M; at 1.1 pN/μm2, where bacteria adhere firmly (Fig. 3), 20% of initially adherent bacteria moved within 1 min on 1M, whereas it took 30 min for the same amount of movement to occur on 3M (supplemental Fig. S2). Thus, whereas increased shear did not increase the overall number of bacteria adhering on the 3M surface, it still increased the strength of adhesion of individual adherent bacteria, causing a transition from rolling to stationary adhesion. However, on 3M, bacteria both rolled slower and had a longer stationary lifetime compared with on 1M. Mutations Decreasing Shear Dependence of 1M Binding Similarly Affect 3M-specific Binding—We have proposed previously that the FimH-mediated adhesion of E. coli to 1M can be tuned by point mutations that affect extension (by shear-derived tensile force) of the linker chain between the pilin and the lectin domain of FimH (16Thomas W.E. Nilsson L.M. Forero M. Sokurenko E.V. Vogel V. Mol. Microbiol. 2004; 53: 1545-1557Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). We tested whether the putative linker extension-inhibiting mutations Q32A/S124A or the extension-facilitating mutation V156P (Fig. 4, A and C), which increase or decrease, respectively, the shear dependence of binding to 1M, also affect 3M binding under shear stress. Neither V156P nor Q32A/S124A had a significant effect on E. coli accumulation on 3M-coated surfaces under shear (Fig. 5A), whereas the effect on the 1M-coated surfaces was obvious (Fig. 5B). However, the difference between the FimH variants in the shear-dependent stick-and-roll transition on 3M substrate was rather dramatic (Fig. 5C) and corresponded well to the effects on 1M-coated surfaces (Fig. 5D). On both surfaces, the linker extension-inhibiting mutations Q32A/S124A resulted in a 2-fold increase, on average, in the proportion of bacteria rolling rather than adhering firmly at low shears (i.e. made the adhesion more dependent on shear). In contrast, the extension-facilitating mutation V156P resulted in the vast majority of bacteria adhering in stationary mode at all shears on both 3M and 1M surfaces (i.e. made the adhesion significantly less dependent on shear). Thus, mutations that increase or decrease shear dependence of 1M binding also do so to the 3M-specific interaction, although in the latter case affecting mainly the stick-and-roll behavior under shear. These results strongly indicate that a similar mechanism involving the interdomain linker region of FimH is responsible for the shear-dependent binding of bacteria via FimH to 1M and 3M surfaces. Mutations in the 1M-binding Pocket Similarly Affect 1M- and 3M-specific Binding under Shear—To test further to what extent the 1M-binding subsite is involved in the 3M-specific interaction under shear, we modified some of the residues that constitute the 1M-binding site according to the crystal structure (18Hung C.S. Bouckaert J. Hung D. Pinkner J. Widberg C. DeFusco A. Auguste C.G. Strouse R. Langermann S. Waksman G. Hultgren S.J. Mol. Microbiol. 2002; 44: 903-915Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar) and determined their effect on the 3M-specific binding under various shear stresses. Most of the 1M-binding residues are primarily clustered on two larger loops that form a hydrophobic ring around the FimH 1M-binding site, with the N terminus also contributing to the ligand interaction. Most of the mutations tested here have been tested previously in static conditions only and in the shear-dependent FimH variant (from E. coli strain J96) with relatively weak 1M-binding under static conditions (18Hung C.S. Bouckaert J. Hung D. Pinkner J. Widberg C. DeFusco A. Auguste C.G. Strouse R. Langermann S. Waksman G. Hultgren S.J. Mol. Microbiol. 2002; 44: 903-915Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). Instead, we introduced these and other mutations into the background of the same FimH variant but with the V156P mutation that mediates a high level and strength of adhesion to both 1M and 3M ligands already in static conditions (see above). This provides better means to examine quantitatively the functional effects of binding site substitutions. Residues Asn46, Ile53, Asp54, Asp140, and Gln133, which all hydrogen-bond to 1M in the crystal structure (18Hung C.S. Bouckaert J. Hung D. Pinkner J. Widberg C. DeFusco A. Auguste C.G. Strouse R. Langermann S. Waksman G. Hultgren S.J. Mol. Microbiol. 2002; 44: 903-915Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar), and residues Tyr137 and Asp141, which also define the 1M subsite, were replaced one by one with alanine (Fig. 4). In order to assess the mutations that probably block access to the 1M-binding site, residues Asn46 and Asp54 were also mutated to glutamic acid and glutamine, respectively. Finally, a glycine was introduced between the 1M-binding residue Phe1 and residue Ala2, which are both located at the base of the pocket (mutation 1G2). None of the mutations affected incorporation of FimH into the surface-expressed fimbriae as determined with anti-FimH antibodies (not shown). In static assays, individual pocket mutations caused a similar reduction in binding on 3M and on 1M or, in the case of the IG2 and D54A mutations, conversion into non-mannose-specific binding mode (Fig. 6A). This suggests that the 3M ligand of 3M-RB is likely to bind to the extended FimH binding pocket in such a way that its terminal mannose residue is incorporated into the 1M pocket in a similar way"

However, current assay systems for glutathione lack application to intact animal tissues. To map the levels of glutathione in intact brain with cellular resolution (acute tissue slices and live animals), we have used two-photon imaging of monochlorobimane fluorescence, a selective enzyme-mediated marker for reduced glutathione. Previously, in vitro experiments using purified components and cultured glial cells attributed cellular monochlorobimane fluorescence to a glutathione S-transferase-dependent reaction with GSH. Our results indicate that cells at the cerebrospinal fluid or blood-brain interface, such as lateral ventricle ependymal cells (2.73 ± 0.56 mm; glutathione), meningeal cells (1.45 ± 0.09 mm), and astroglia (0.91 ± 0.08 mm), contain high levels of glutathione. In comparison, layer II cortical neurons contained 20% (0.21 ± 0.02 mm) the glutathione content of nearby astrocytes. Neuronal glutathione labeling increased 250% by the addition of the cell-permeable glutathione precursor N-acetylcysteine indicating that the monochlorobimane level or glutathione S-transferase activity within neurons was not limiting. Regional mapping showed that glutathione was highest in cells lining the lateral ventricles, specifically ependymal cells and the subventricular zone, suggesting a possible function for glutathione in oxidant homeostasis of developing neuronal progenitors. Consistently, developing neurons in the subgranular zone of dentate gyrus contained 3-fold more glutathione than older neurons found in the neighboring granular layer. In conclusion, mapping of glutathione levels in intact brain demonstrates a unique role for enhanced redox potential in developing neurons and cells at the cerebrospinal fluid and blood-brain interface.

The tripeptide glutathione (GSH; γ-l-glutamyl-l-cysteinylglycine) is the most abundant low molecular weight thiol in mammalian cells and constitutes a major cellular defense against reactive oxygen species. Deficiency in the GSH system has been linked to neuronal loss during progression of neurodegenerative diseases, such as Parkinson, Alzheimer, Huntington, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (1Schulz J.B. Lindenau J. Seyfried J. Dichgans J. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 4904-4911Crossref PubMed Scopus (1033) Google Scholar, 2Bains J.S. Shaw C.A. Brain Res. Brain Res.

FASEB J. 2001; 15: 243-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) and stroke (5Liu T.H. Beckman J.S. Freeman B.A. Hogan E.L. Hsu C.Y. Am. J.

Although reactive oxygen species accumulation has been implicated in these disorders, examination of GSH levels in previous studies has largely been restricted to enzymatic assays and fluorescent probes that are only applicable in neuronal and glial cell cultures or brain homogenates. A widely used method for measuring GSH in cultured cells and tissue homogenates employs monochlorobimane (MCB) 4The abbreviations used are: MCB, monochlorobimane; GST, glutathione S-transferase; TPLSM, two-photon laser scanning microscopy; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; ACSF, artificial cerebral spinal fluid; FITC, fluorescein isothiocyanate; BSO, l-buthionine sulfoximine; DCX, double cortin; PI, propidium iodide; Mrp, multidrug resistance protein; CSF, cerebrospinal fluid; SR 101, sulforhodamine 101; PMT, photo-multiplier tube. 4The abbreviations used are: MCB, monochlorobimane; GST, glutathione S-transferase; TPLSM, two-photon laser scanning microscopy; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; ACSF, artificial cerebral spinal fluid; FITC, fluorescein isothiocyanate; BSO, l-buthionine sulfoximine; DCX, double cortin; PI, propidium iodide; Mrp, multidrug resistance protein; CSF, cerebrospinal fluid; SR 101, sulforhodamine 101; PMT, photo-multiplier tube. (8Chatterjee S. Noack H. Possel H. Keilhoff G. Wolf G. Glia. 1999; 27: 152-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), a normally nonfluorescent dye that when conjugated to reduced GSH by intracellular glutathione S-transferases (GSTs) forms adducts that can be measured fluorometrically. Recently, investigators have established that GSH in epidermal cells of intact Arabidopsis roots can be elegantly and quantitatively measured by two-photon laser scanning microscopy (TPLSM) with MCB (9Meyer A.J. Fricker M.D. J. Microsc. (Oxf.). 2000; 198: 174-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Accordingly, we now use a similar approach in intact mammalian brain to directly monitor GSH levels in different tissues. Data on GSH concentrations in different brain areas of various species obtained using chemical techniques have been summarized (10Cooper A.J. Kristal B.S. Biol. Chem. 1997; 378: 793-802PubMed Google Scholar). However, because these results were derived from tissue homogenates, they only provide information on the average GSH content. It is also conceivable that other techniques such as thiol-reactive probes (11Hjelle O.P. Chaudhry F.A. Ottersen O.P. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1994; 6: 793-804Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar) may lack specificity for GSH or suffer from the disposition of thiols/GSH changing in response to animal sacrifice and/or fixation. Furthermore, studies from cultured brain cells are potentially affected by media constituents that contain high levels of GSH precursors such as cystine, present at 100 μm in minimal essential media but less than 1 mm in cerebrospinal fluid in vivo (12Wang X.F. Cynader M.S. J. Neurochem. 2000; 74: 1434-1442Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). Here we show that MCB is a specific probe for GSH labeling in brain tissues, and TPLSM can be used to image GSH content in various brain regions at the cellular level. In our assay, the extracellular environment contains a large reservoir of MCB (compared with intracellular GSH), and therefore the reaction between MCB and GSH is first order and can be described by a single exponential function. As we have shown for cell cultures using plate reader assays (13Sun X. Erb H. Murphy T.H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2005; 326: 371-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), we can now use TPLSM imaging in situ to measure several kinetic parameters of GSH metabolism such as its conjugation rate by GST and total GSH-MCB content. By applying TPLSM to rat brain slices and neocortex of live anesthetized mice, we have found that GSH is enriched in meninges, lateral ependymal cells, astrocytes, and immature neurons in dentate gyrus. Neocortical neurons in slices from mature animals can be labeled by MCB but at a much lower level of fluorescence, suggesting that glial, meningeal, and ependymal cell sources may play a dominant role in buffering brain oxidative stress. Chemicals—All reagents were purchased from Sigma unless mentioned otherwise. Monochlorobimane was purchased from either Fluka or Molecular Probes and made as a 100 mm stock solution in Me2SO and stored at -20 °C. Sulforhodamine 101 (SR 101) was prepared as a 10 mm stock solution in Me2SO and also stored at -20 °C. Propidium iodide was purchased from Molecular Probes and made as a 10 mm solution in PBS and stored at 4 °C. Primary antibodies used in this study included anti-laminin (rabbit), anti-S-100β (mouse), and anti-NeuN (mouse, Chemicon). Secondary antibodies included FITC anti-rabbit, FITC anti-mouse, and Alexa 594 anti-mouse (Molecular Probes). Plate Reader GSH Assay—Fluorometric assays were performed using a plate reader (Fluoroskan; Ascent, FL), λex = 355 ± 19 nm and λem = 527 ± 5 nm. Although these excitation/emission filters are suboptimal for MCB detection, they prevented saturation of the detector within the plate reader permitting linearity between the concentration of MCB-GSH and detected fluorescence over the range associated with the fluorescence values in our measurements. Purified 200 μm GSH and 10 μm MCB were added together, with varying concentrations of purified GST enzyme (0, 0.01, 0.02, and 0.04 units (equine); Sigma). Fluorescence was measured using a plate reader over a 4-h reaction period. Calibration of the GSH-MCB Fluorescence—A5mm stock solution of GSH-MCB was made from 20 mm GSH and 3 mm MCB in the presence of a GST. Excess GSH and GST were used to ensure that all MCB was conjugated. A dilution series of 5, 1.5, 0.5, and 0.15 mm was made from this stock. The standard solutions were contained within in vitro cells (glass microcuvettes, inner diameter = 50 μm; VitroCom) and imaged with two-photon microscopy using identical power settings to those used on brain tissues. This method of GSH-MCB calibration was routinely used in our studies in brain slices. Rat Brain Slice Preparation—Coronal brain slices were prepared from P15-21 or P1-2 Wistar rats (Charles River Breeding Laboratories, Canada). Under halothane anesthesia, animals were killed, and the brain was quickly removed from the skull and placed in ice-cold cutting solution containing (in mm) 200 sucrose, 2.5 KCl, 0.5 CaCl2, 26.2 NaHCO3, 10 MgSO4·7H2O, 1 NaH2PO4, 11 glucose (pH was maintained at 7.4 by saturation with 95%O2 and 5%CO2). Slices (300 μm) were obtained with a vibratome (Leica VT 1000 S) and then transferred to a static bath chamber where they were maintained at room temperature for at least 1 h before imaging. The slices were kept in artificial cerebral spinal fluid (ACSF) containing (in mm) 120 NaCl, 26.2 NaHCO3, 24.2 glucose, 2.5 KCl, 1.25 NaH2PO4,1MgCl2·6H2O, 2 CaCl2, saturated with 95% O2 and 5% CO2. For imaging, individual slices were transferred to a recording chamber and perfused with ACSF saturated with 95% O2 and 5% CO2. MCB was added to the perfusion system at a final concentration of 60 μm. To identify dead cells, we added 10 μm propidium iodide together with MCB. Animal Preparation for in Vivo Imaging—All experiments were approved by the University of British Columbia Animal Care Committee and were conducted in strict accordance with guidelines from the Canadian Council on Animal Care. C57Bl/6 mice were purchased from The Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME) and bred at the University of British Columbia animal facilities. Cranial windows for in vivo imaging were produced as described previously (14Zhang S. Boyd J. Delaney K. Murphy T.H. J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 5333-5338Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). In brief, mice aged 3-5 months were deeply anesthetized with an intraperitoneal injection of urethane (0.12% w/w, supplemented with 0.02% w/w as needed) (15Kleinfeld D. Mitra P.P. Helmchen F. Denk W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 15741-15746Crossref PubMed Scopus (657) Google Scholar), and 20 mm glucose in PBS was supplemented to maintain animal hydration (0.2-0.3 ml, intraperitoneal injection, every 1 h). Body temperature was maintained at 37 °C using a feedback-regulated heating pad. An air-powered dental drill was used to produce a 2 × 2-mm2 cranial window over the somatosensory cortex at coordinates of 0.8 mm from bregma and 2.0 mm lateral, leaving the dura intact. A stainless steel chamber that surrounded the craniotomy was glued to the skull with Krazy Glue (Elmer's Products, Columbus, OH). To reduce movement artifacts, the area between the chamber and the skull was filled with dental acrylic (16Kleinfeld D. Denk W. Imaging Neurons: A Laboratory Manual. 2000; (15, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY): 23.1-2323Google Scholar). The exposed cortical surface and chamber were filled with 2% (w/v) agarose (diluted in PBS or a HEPES-buffered ACSF) and sealed with a cover glass. For in vivo labeling, MCB and SR 101 stocks were dissolved in PBS to a final concentration of 100 μm and applied directly to the exposed brain surface. Two-photon Microscopy—Two-photon excitation of GSH-MCB conjugates was achieved using a Coherent (Santa Clara, CA) Mira 900 Ti:sapphire laser pumped by a 5-watt Verdi laser tuned to 780 nm. Images were acquired using custom software routines (IgorPro; Wavemetrics, Eugene, OR) and by using an Olympus (Tokyo, Japan) IR-LUMPlanFl water-immersion objective (40×; 0.80 numerical aperture). When MCB was used in combination with SR 101, the laser was operated at 800 nm, and fluorescence was collected using photo-multiplier tube 1 (PMT1) for the GSH-MCB signal (512-562 nm), and PMT2 for the SR 101 signal (620 - 645 nm). For immunostaining, FITC and Alexa 594 were used as secondary antibody fluorophores. Both fluorophores were excited at 800 nm, and the signals were collected on PMT1 and PMT2, respectively. Excitation power was measured at the objective back aperature. For two-photon imaging of various tissues, the following power settings were used: lateral ventricle ∼20-30 milliwatts, ∼40-50-milliwatt cortical astrocytes, and 80-90 milliwatts for neurons. Power through the objective was at least 50% lower than that measured at the back aperture because of back aperture overfilling and absorbance by glass. Tissue Fixation and Immunostaining—After MCB labeling and two-photon imaging, slices were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 m phosphate buffer (pH 7.2) for 1 h. Slices were then rinsed twice with PBS and treated with primary antibody against S-100β (1:1000 in antibody buffer), NeuN (1:100 in antibody buffer), or laminin (1:500 in antibody buffer) for 48 h at 4 °C. The antibody buffer contained 0.1% Triton X-100 and 2% goat serum in PBS. After washing twice with PBS, the slices were incubated with secondary antibodies (FITC anti-rabbit, FITC anti-mouse, and Alexa 594 anti-mouse; diluted 1:200 in antibody buffer) for 48 h in dark at 4 °C. After secondary antibody labeling, slices were washed twice with PBS and imaged with two-photon microscopy. Image Analysis—Image analysis was performed using NIH ImageJ software. To reduce photon and PMT noise, a median filter (radius = 1 or 2) was applied. The fluorescence intensity was converted to GSH-MCB concentration according to a standard curve. For statistical analyses, two-tail paired t test or repeated measures one-way analysis of variance was used with GraphPad Prism (version 2.01). Data were expressed as mean ± S.E. Specificity of Monochlorobimane Labeling—Currently, MCB is the probe of choice for measuring GSH levels in intact cells. MCB is essentially nonfluorescent in the absence of GSH. In a reaction catalyzed by GST, GSH is conjugated to MCB, generating a product with blue-green fluorescence (17Cook J.A. Iype S.N. Mitchell J.B. Cancer Res. 1991; 51: 1606-1612PubMed Google Scholar, 18Ublacker G.A. Johnson J.A. Siegel F.L. Mulcahy R.T. Cancer Res. 1991; 51: 1783-1788PubMed Google Scholar). MCB has advantages over other bimane derivative dyes for measuring GSH, such as monobromobimane and monobromotrimethylammoniobimane, because it shows very low affinity for other low molecular weight or protein thiols (i.e. cysteine) (19Meyer A.J. May M.J. Fricker M. Plant J. 2001; 27: 67-78Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Using a plate reader assay, we further tested the specificity of MCB for the reduced form of GSH in in vitro experiments using purified GST to catalyze the reaction. In the absence of GST, addition of 200 μm GSH to 10 μm MCB resulted in a modest linear increase in fluorescent product over time (Fig. 1A). Addition of purified GST (0.01-0.04 units) resulted in a robust single exponential phase increase in the fluorescence intensity, indicating that this is an enzyme-catalyzed reaction following first-order kinetics (Fig. 1A). The curve can be fitted with Equation 1, F=F0+Fmax(1−exp(−(t−t0)/τ))(Eq. 1) where F is the fluorescence intensity; Fmax is the maximum fluorescence intensity, and τ is the time constant of the reaction. The plateau level of the in vitro reaction (purified components) was related to the amount of GSH and MCB added, but not GST, whereas the initial conjugation rate was proportional to the GST amount. The time constants of the exponential phase were 1437, 691, and 344 s, respectively, for 0.01, 0.02, and 0.04 units of GST. The GST dependence of this reaction confers the specificity of MCB for labeling GSH. When comparing different cell populations in subsequent brain slices and in vivo experiments, we recorded time courses to ensure that all reactions proceeded to completion, and thus GST activity was not a limiting factor. Because MCB is a membrane-permeable dye (8Chatterjee S. Noack H. Possel H. Keilhoff G. Wolf G. Glia. 1999; 27: 152-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) and GST is widely expressed in brain cells, such as neurons and glial cells (20Hayes J.D. Flanagan J.U. Jowsey I.R. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2005; 45: 51-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (2921) Google Scholar), a similar labeling effect should be achievable in brain cells, thus allowing the measurement of cellular GSH content by measuring the fluorescence intensity of the accumulated GSH-MCB product. Our previous experiments have confirmed this by showing that MCB labeling of astrocyte cultures, which had been pretreated with the irreversible GSH synthesis inhibitor l-buthionine sulfoximine (BSO), have a significantly reduced MCB fluorescence at the reaction plateau (13Sun X. Erb H. Murphy T.H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2005; 326: 371-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The reduced fluorescence was not because of a direct effect of the BSO itself because addition of exogenous GSH greatly increased GSH-MCB fluorescence within these cells (13Sun X. Erb H. Murphy T.H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2005; 326: 371-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Consistent with the proposal that the initial rate of GSH conjugation with MCB reflects GST activity and not necessarily GSH levels, we observed that treatment of astrocyte cultures with BSO (to lower the available GSH pool) did not affect the initial GSH-MCB conjugation rate (data not shown). Fortuitously, at room temperature, which was used for all brain slice experiments, the efflux of GSH-MCB conjugates was negligible (cellular fluorescence did not decrease after extensively washing MCB from the perfusate; GSH-MCB concentration in neurons changed from 0.143 ± 0.011 to 0.149 ± 0.020 mm with washout, p > 0.05; in astrocytes, it changed from 0.726 ± 0.071 to 0.727 ± 0.065 mm, p > 0.05), suggesting that the measured GSH content was not underestimated because of MCB-GSH efflux from the cell. In contrast, in astrocyte cell culture at 37 °C the conjugate was largely effluxed from cells. Astrocyte efflux could be inhibited by treatment with MK571, a blocker of multidrug resistance proteins (Mrps) (13Sun X. Erb H. Murphy T.H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2005; 326: 371-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 21Hirrlinger J. Schulz J.B. Dringen R. J. Neurosci. Res. 2002; 69: 318-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 22Borst P. Evers R. Kool M. Wijnholds J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1461: 347-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (582) Google Scholar). In brain slice experiments at room temperature, we observed no significant effect of MK571 (50 μm) inhibition of Mrps on MCB fluorescence (p > 0.05 from five separate slice experiments). Thus our results confirmed that MCB can be used to label intracellular GSH with the plateau level of fluorescence intensity indicating the cellular GSH content, whereas the initial conjugation rate reflected GST activity. Feasibility of Two-photon Laser Scanning Microscopy for Measurement of Cellular GSH Levels—GSH-MCB conjugate emits significant fluorescence at 450-575 nm when excited by TPLSM at 780 nm (9Meyer A.J. Fricker M.D. J. Microsc. (Oxf.). 2000; 198: 174-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The in vitro production of GSH-MCB using purified reagents allowed us to produce defined amounts of GSH-MCB to use as standards in TPLSM experiments. The standard curve indicated that TPLSM was a viable technique to measure up to 5 mm concentrations of GSH (Fig. 1B). GSH-MCB standards containing microcuvettes (50 μm path length) were placed on the two-photon microscope and imaged in an identical manner as brain slices. Assuming that the GST-mediated conjugation of GSH with MCB goes to completion, as indicated by our time course analysis, and that little GSH-MCB efflux occurs at room temperature, we expect the GSH-MCB fluorescence intensity measured by using this method to be proportional to the cellular GSH concentration. To ensure that differences in fluorescence path length do not contribute to the observed differences in GSH levels between cells and tissues, we optically sectioned each cell and made maximal intensity projections over regions of cells that were considerably larger than the axial resolution of the microscope (<3 μm). By choosing these thicker regions of the cell, we assumed that MCB fluorescence intensity is proportional to GSH-MCB concentration and not structure path length or volume (9Meyer A.J. Fricker M.D. J. Microsc. (Oxf.). 2000; 198: 174-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). To determine whether two-photon imaging of GSH-MCB fluorescence yields results that are proportional to a classical biochemical assay of total GSH, we compared the GSH level of cultured astrocytes treated with varying concentrations of BSO (0, 3, and 10 μm) or 1 mm N-acetylcysteine using either the Tietze method (23Tietze F. Anal. Biochem. 1969; 27: 502-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (5534) Google Scholar) or two-photon imaging (Fig. 1C). As expected, the Tietze method showed that these treatments resulted in cells with graded total GSH content. On parallel cultures treated at room temperature and with MK571 to reduce conjugate efflux, we performed two-photon imaging on the various groups of astrocytes using the same procedures for brain slices. By using standards produced in vitro, we converted GSH-MCB fluorescence to an equivalent GSH concentration. Comparison between the various astrocyte treatments indicated remarkable correspondence between the assays (R2 = 0.99) confirming that GSH-MCB fluorescence measured by two-photon imaging is directly proportional to total GSH determined by a classic method of assaying GSH. These results also suggest that the local intracellular environment or organelle sequestration does not have a major effect on the concentration of GSH reported by the two-photon imaging technique. Meningeal Cells and Astrocytes in Neocortex Are Labeled Intensely by MCB in Rat Brain Slices—After establishing that MCB can be a specific indicator of GSH, we examined the GSH distribution in various brain tissues in acute P15-20 rat slices at room temperature. On the slice surface many unstained cell bodies appeared as black holes and were labeled by the polar membrane-impermeable marker propidium iodide (PI) (24St John P.A. Kell W.M. Mazzetta J.S. Lange G.D. Barker J.L. J. Neurosci. 1986; 6: 1492-1512Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) indicating that they had ruptured membranes (data not shown). As we imaged deeper into slices (over 20-30 μm deep), there was a lower incidence of unstained cell bodies, indicating that cell death at the slice surface was caused by vibratome sectioning (data not shown). Within live brain slices MCB robustly labeled the meninges and a subpopulation of cells in neocortex with astroglial morphology, as well as perivascular cells (Fig. 2A). In order to verify the cell type of these GSH-positive cells, we performed immunostaining with the calcium-binding protein S-100β, a specific marker of astrocytes in fixed slices (25Matthias K. Kirchhoff F. Seifert G. Huttmann K. Matyash M. Kettenmann H. Steinhauser C. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 1750-1758Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Importantly, to reduce the possible changes in GSH distribution following fixation, we obtained all GSH-MCB localization data from live tissues. To label astrocytes in fixed tissues, we used antibodies to S-100β because markers such as glial fibrillary acidic protein fail to label all astrocyte cell populations (26Walz W. Lang M.K. Neurosci. Lett. 1998; 257: 127-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Because MCB tends to leak out of cells in paraformaldehyde-fixed tissue, we also stained the slices with either laminin, which is a major component of basement membranes in blood vessels, or PI as landmarks to locate the same region from which we had imaged GSH-MCB (Fig. 2B). As fixation of slices caused some distortion of cell position, we examined co-localization based on cell morphology and the relative position of cells over a relatively small area. Most of the highly fluorescent MCB-labeled neocortical cells were S-100β-positive and thus were presumably astrocytes (75% MCB/S-100β co-staining, n = 47, 2 animals with 2 slices each; see Fig. 2C). The perivascular cells were also S-100β-positive astrocytes with their end feet tightly ensheathing the vessel wall (Fig. 2, A and C, arrowhead). An increased level of GSH in astrocytes is consistent with their crucial role in the antioxidant defense of the brain (10Cooper A.J. Kristal B.S. Biol. Chem. 1997; 378: 793-802PubMed Google Scholar, 27Anderson M.F. Blomstrand F. Blomstrand C. Eriksson P.S. Nilsson M. Neurochem.

For example, astrocytes can protect neurons from oxidative stress via GSH-dependent mechanisms and therefore would be expected to require an intracellular reservoir of GSH (29Iwata-Ichikawa E. Kondo Y. Miyazaki I. Asanuma M. Ogawa N. J. Neurochem. 1999; 72: 2334-2344Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 30Chen Y. Vartiainen N.E. Ying W. Chan P.H. Koistinaho J. Swanson R.A. J.

In addition to astrocytes, we also found that meningeal cells (most likely pial and arachnoid cell layers) were intensely labeled by MCB, indicating a very high GSH level. Meningeal cells have received little attention with respect to neuroprotection except for their role in the regulation of blood flow and the blood-cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) barrier (33Ghersi-Egea J.F. Leninger-Muller B. Suleman G. Siest G. Minn A. J. Neurochem. 1994; 62: 1089-1096Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 34Tanno H. Nockels R.P. Pitts L.H. Noble L.J. J. Cereb. Blood Flow Metab. 1993; 13: 116-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Related structures such as the choroid plexus have been long known to filter and remove exogenous and endogenous toxins from the CSF (35McKinnon S.G. Neuroimaging Clin. N. Am. 1998; 8: 101-117PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, Sato et al. (36Sato H. Tamba M. Okuno S. Sato K. Keino-Masu K. Masu M. Bannai S. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 8028-8033Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) found that the high affinity cystine-glutamate antiporter system xc- (xCT) is expressed at particularly high levels in meninges. In many cell types, the uptake of cystine is the rate-limiting step for GSH synthesis. Meningeal cells may use xCT-dependent cystine uptake as an efficient means to supply cysteine for maintenance of a large GSH pool. This enhanced GSH production by the meninges may play an important role in buffering brain"

Here, we systematically examined the functional consequence of AQP expression in mitochondria by measurement of water and glycerol permeabilities in mitochondrial membrane preparations from rat brain, liver, and kidney and from wild-type versus knock-out mice deficient in AQPs -1, -4, or -8. Osmotic water permeability, measured by stopped-flow light scattering, was similar in all mitochondrial preparations, with a permeability coefficient Pf ∼ 0.009 cm/s. Glycerol permeability was also similar (∼5 × 10–6 cm/s) in the various preparations. HgCl2 slowed osmotic equilibration comparably in mitochondria from wild-type and AQP-deficient mice, although the slowing was explained by altered mitochondrial size rather than reduced Pf. Immunoblot analysis of mouse liver mitochondria failed to detect AQP8 expression, with liver homogenates from wild-type/AQP8 null mice as positive/negative controls. Our results provide evidence against functionally significant AQP expression in mitochondria, which is consistent with the high mitochondrial surface-to-volume ratio producing millisecond osmotic equilibration, even when intrinsic membrane water permeability is not high. Recent reports suggest the expression of aquaporin (AQP)-type water channels in mitochondria from liver (AQP8) (Calamita, G., Ferri, D., Gena, P., Liquori, G.

Functionally significant expression of aquaporin (AQP) 2The abbreviations used are: AQP, aquaporin; IMM, inner mitochondrial membranes.2The abbreviations used are: AQP, aquaporin; IMM, inner mitochondrial membranes.-type water channels has been demonstrated in plasma membranes in various cell types in kidney, brain, eye, glandular epithelia, endothelia, epidermis, fat, and other tissues. As demonstrated by phenotype comparisons of wild-type and AQP knock-out mice, plasma membrane AQPs are important in the urinary concentration mechanism, glandular fluid secretion, regulation of intraocular and intracranial pressures, cell migration, brain swelling, epidermal hydration, adipocyte metabolism, and other functions (1Verkman A.S. J. Cell Sci. 2005; 118: 3225-3232Crossref PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar). Whether AQPs play a role in intracellular organellar functions is less clear. The vasopressin-regulated water channel AQP2 is expressed in both the plasma membrane and in a recycling endosomal compartment in kidney collecting cells (2Brown D. Am. J. Physiol. 2003; 284: F893-F901Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar, 3Noda Y. Sasaki S. Biol. Cell. 2005; 97: 885-892Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Although endosomes in the kidney collecting duct are highly water-permeable (4Verkman A.S. Lencer W.I. Brown D. Ausiello D.A. Nature. 1988; 333: 268-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), it is likely that their high water permeability is a consequence of dense AQP2 expression rather than a need for high endosomal water permeability. Indeed, the high surface-to-volume ratio of endosomes and other organelles, generally >3 × 105 cm–1 (diameter < 200 nm) predicts very rapid osmotic equilibration times of <100 ms, even when osmotic water permeability (Pf) is low (<0.005 cm/s). Other AQPs have been reported in endosomes in some cell types, including AQP6 in the renal proximal tubule and collecting duct epithelial cells (5Yasui M. Kwon T.H. Knepper M.A. Nielsen S. Agre P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 5808-5813Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar) and various AQPs in liver cells (6Masyuk A.I. Larusso N.F. Hepatology. 2006; 43: S75-S81Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), although data are lacking on their possible cellular functions. Two recent studies reported AQP expression in mitochondria and suggested possible involvement of mitochondrial AQPs in many functions, including metabolism and apoptosis, and in the pathogenesis of neurological diseases such as Parkinson disease. Calamita et al. (7Calamita G. Ferri D. Gena P. Liquori G.E. Cavalier A. Thomas D. Svelto M. J. Biol.

FASEB J. 2005; 19: 1459-1467Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar) report AQP9 expression in astroglia throughout rat brain and in a subset of neurons, although no functional analysis was done. As speculated in these reports, AQP expression and function in mitochondria could have wide-ranging biological consequences. However, our recent phenotype analysis of AQP8 knock-out mice shows normal liver phenotype (9Yang B. Song Y. Zhao D. Verkman A.S. Am. J. Physiol. 2005; 288: C1161-C1170Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar), and a preliminary analysis of recently generated AQP9 knock-out mice by the Nielsen laboratory (10Rojek A.M. Skowronski M.T. Fuchtbauer E. Frokiaer J. Nielsen S. FASEB J. 2005; 19 (abstr.): A637Google Scholar) did not demonstrate authentic AQP9 immunoreactivity in mouse brain, suggesting that prior AQP9 immunoreactivity in brain may have been artifactual. Because of the potential importance of mitochondrial AQP expression, we have systematically examined the predicted functional consequences of such expression. We have focused on functional transport measurements of mitochondrial inner membrane preparations rather than on antibody staining studies because of the relatively poor available antibodies against AQP8 and AQP9. AQP8 function was studied by comparative measurements of osmotic water permeability in liver mitochondrial membranes from wild-type versus AQP8 knock-out mice, as well as from HgCl2 effects and water permeability measurements in mitochondrial membranes from several different mouse and rat tissues. AQP9 function was studied by measurements of water and glycerol permeabilities in brain mitochondria, as AQP9 is an efficient glycerol transporter (11Tsukaguchi H. Shayakul C. Berger U.V.

Animals—Adult wild-type mice and transgenic mice in a CD1 genetic background lacking AQP1, AQP4, or AQP8 protein were generated by targeted gene disruption as described previously (9Yang B. Song Y.

All animal procedures were approved by the University of California- San Francisco Committee on Animal Research. Mitochondria Isolation and Preparation of Inner Mitochondrial Membranes (IMMs)—Tissues were homogenized with a Potter-Elvehjem homogenizer in isolation medium consisting of 220 mm mannitol, 70 mm sucrose, 20 mm Tris-HCl, 1 mm EDTA, 5 mm EGTA, 20 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm leupeptin, and 1 mm pepstatin A, pH 7.4, at 4 °C as described previously (7Calamita G.

The homogenate was centrifuged at 500 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The pellet consisting of nuclei and unbroken cells was discarded and the supernatant was centrifuged at 1,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, washed twice, and resuspended in isolation medium. The 1,000 × g supernatant was collected, centrifuged at 3,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, washed twice, and resuspended. A similar procedure was used to prepare the 6,000 and 17,000 × g fractions. IMMs were prepared using a detergent approach as described previously (7Calamita G. Ferri D. Gena P. Liquori G.E. Cavalier A. Thomas D. Svelto M. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 17149-17153Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Briefly, digitonin was added to suspensions of 1,000, 3,000, or 6,000 × g fractions (100 mg of protein/ml) separately to a final concentration of 0.6% w/v in isolation medium and incubated for 15 min on ice under gentle stirring. After dilution with three volumes of isolation medium, the suspension was centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The resulting pellet (mitoplasts) was resuspended in isolation medium at 15 mg protein/ml and sonicated with a probe sonicator (Fisher Scientific) for six 5-s bursts at the maximum energy setting with 30-s cooling periods. After sonication, mitoplasts were diluted with an equal volume of isolation medium and centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The resulting pellet was resuspended in 10 volumes of isolation medium and centrifuged again at 100,000 × g; this process was repeated twice. Vesicle purity was determined by assay of cytochrome c oxidase and alkaline phosphodiesterase I activities as described previously (15Storrie B. Madden E.A. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 182: 203-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar). Vesicle Size Measurement—Vesicle diameter was determined by quasi-elastic light scattering using a Zetasizer (Malvern Instruments, Inc., Southborough, MA). For electron microscopy, suspended mitochondria or IMM vesicles were fixed in 1% glutaraldehyde in 47 mm sodium cacodylate at pH 7.4 for 5 min and then centrifuged at 13,000 × g for 10 min. The pellet was post-fixed in 1% veronal osmic acid for 1 h and dehydrated in graded ethanol and embedded in araldite. Sections of ∼80 nm thickness were cut and photographed on a JEOL 1200 EX electron microscope operating at 80 kV. Immunoblot Analysis—Total protein was assayed in subcellular fractions using a commercial assay (DC protein assay kit, Bio-Rad, Richmond, CA) and loaded on a 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel (10 μg/lane). Proteins were blotted to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Gelman Scientific, Ann Arbor, MI) and immunoblotted by standard procedures. Membranes were incubated with 1:1000 dilution of rabbit polyclonal serum raised against an N-terminal peptide (NH2-SMDLPE-VKVKTSMAGRC-COOH) of mouse AQP8 (generated by Abgent, San Diego, CA). Stopped-flow Measurement of Water and Glycerol Permeabilities—Stopped-flow measurements were done on a Hi-Tech Sf-51 instrument. For measurement of osmotic water permeability, vesicle suspensions were mixed in under 1 ms with a hypertonic mannitol solution (in the same buffer as the samples, but with 300 mm mannitol added). The kinetics of decreasing mitochondria/vesicle volume was measured from the time course of 90° scattered light intensity at a 530-nm wavelength. Osmotic water permeability coefficients (Pf) were calculated as described previously (16Verkman A.S. J. Membr. Biol. 2000; 173: 73-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). In some experiments, samples were incubated with 0.3 mm HgCl2 (prepared freshly) for 5 min prior to stopped-flow measurements. For measurement of glycerol permeability, mitochondria were subjected to a 150 mm inwardly directed gradient of glycerol. Glycerol permeability (Pglycerol) was computed as Pglycerol = 1/[(S/V)τ], where S/V is surface-to-volume ratio (assuming smooth, spherical vesicle) and τ is the exponential time constant fitted to the vesicle swelling phase of the light scattering time course corresponding to glycerol entry. Characterization of Mitochondrial Preparations—Mitochondrial membrane fractions and IMMs were isolated from mouse and rat liver. Fig. 1A shows morphology of the 3,000 × g fractions (whole mitochondria, top; IMM, bottom) from the livers of wild-type and AQP8 null mice. The size distribution of whole mitochondria and IMM of the 3,000 × g fraction determined by quasi-elastic light scattering are shown in Fig. 1B. The electron microscopy and quasi-elastic light scattering data show reasonably uniform size distributions from which average diameters were deduced for computation of permeability coefficients. Fig. 1C verifies mitochondrial purity as judged by the activities of the mitochondrial marker with cytochrome c oxidase and the plasma membrane marker alkaline phosphodiesterase I. By immunoblot analysis, a 28-kDa band representing non-glycosylated AQP8 was found in liver homogenate and plasma membranes (17,000 × g fraction) from wild-type mice (Fig. 1D). A very weak band was seen in the 3000 × g fraction, likely representing plasma membrane contamination. No specific AQP8 band was seen in liver homogenate from AQP8 null mice. Water Permeability Measurements—Water permeability in liver IMM vesicles (3,000 × g fraction) from wild-type and AQP8 null mice and from rats was measured by stopped-flow light scattering in response to a 150 mm inwardly directed gradient of mannitol. Scattered light intensity is inversely related to vesicle volume. Fig. 2A shows representative light scattering data at 10 °C, a low temperature in which AQP-facilitated water permeability would be best seen. The kinetics of osmotic equilibration of each of the three IMM vesicle fractions was similar. Fig. 2B summarizes water permeability coefficients (Pf) deduced from the kinetic data and IMM size. Pf values were similar for each of the IMM fractions from mice and rats and not reduced by AQP8 deletion. Temperature dependence measurements were done to investigate the mechanism of IMM water transport. Fig. 2C shows light scattering data at 25 °C. The water permeability in each vesicle fraction was strongly temperature-dependent, increasing ∼2.2-fold from 10 to 25 °C. Fig. 2D summarizes the data as an Arrhenius plot of ln Pf versus reciprocal absolute temperature, where the slope is proportional to the activation energy. Activation energy was computed to be 9–10 kcal/mol, suggesting a lipid diffusion rather than an aquaporin-facilitated mechanism for water transport. Incubation of liver IMM with HgCl2 slowed by ∼2-fold the kinetics of osmotic equilibration in IMM from mouse and rat liver, including IMM from AQP8 null mice (Fig. 3A). The HgCl2 effect is thus not related to AQP8 but could be due to a different mitochondrial HgCl2-sensitive water pathway or to a change in vesicle surface-to-volume ratio or aggregation, which could change the kinetics of osmotic water equilibration in the absence of altered intrinsic membrane water permeability. Fig. 3B shows that apparent vesicle diameter increased by ∼1.7-fold after HgCl2 incubation. Computed Pf values, which take into account vesicle size, were not significantly reduced by HgCl2 (Fig. 3C). Osmotic water permeability measurements were done on mitochondria from different organs, each organ expressing a different aquaporin (liver, AQP8; brain, AQP4; kidney, AQP1; heart, AQP8) (Fig. 4A). Measurements were done on mitochondria from wild-type mice and from mice lacking the appropriate AQP, as well as on rats. Fig. 4B summarizes the Pf values determined for each of the preparations from the data in Fig. 4A and mitochondrial diameters determined by quasi-elastic light scattering. There was no significant difference in the Pf values in the various mitochondrial preparations, suggesting absence of functionally significant AQP expression in mitochondria. Glycerol Permeability Measurements—To test for AQP9-facilitated glycerol transport in rat brain mitochondria, glycerol permeability was compared in mitochondria from rat brain, liver, and kidney. Glycerol permeability was measured by light scattering following a 150 mm inwardly directed gradient of glycerol. Fig. 5A shows representative light scattering data, with the slow decrease in scattered light intensity corresponding to glycerol influx into mitochondria. Experiments were done at 10 °C (left panel) and 25 °C (right panel). There was no significant difference in glycerol permeability coefficients (Pglycerol) in the brain versus liver and kidney (Fig. 5B). Fig. 5C summarizes the data as an Arrhenius plot of ln Pglycerol versus reciprocal absolute temperature. Activations energies were in the range 16–18 kcal/mol, suggesting lipid-rather than aquaporin-facilitated glycerol transport. The purpose of this study was to test the hypothesis that AQP8 and AQP9 provide quantitatively important pathways for osmotically induced water movement across inner mitochondrial membranes. As described in the introduction, these experiments were motivated by recent reports of AQP8 expression in liver mitochondria (7Calamita G. Ferri D. Gena P. Liquori G.E. Cavalier A. Thomas D.

These reports proposed a novel paradigm for aquaporin function with significant implications for mitochondrial biology. The predictions of functionally significant AQP-dependent mitochondrial water permeability include mitochondrial volume regulation during active oxidative phosphorylation (7Calamita G. Ferri D.

Amiry-Moghaddam et al. have hypothesized that altered mitochondrial AQP9 in dopaminergic neurons may relate to their vulnerability in Parkinson disease (8Amiry-Moghaddam M. Lindland H. Zelenin S.

Our study here has defined the functional consequence of AQP expression in mitochondria from measurements of water and glycerol permeabilities in mitochondrial membrane preparations from brain, liver, and kidney in rats and in wild-type versus knock-out mice deficient in various aquaporins.

However, conflicting data have been reported for the subcellular localization of AQP8 expression in liver, perhaps because of the poor available AQP8 antibodies. Immunohistochemistry in rat shows AQP8 protein expression in intracellular vesicles in hepatocytes (21Elkjaer M.L. Nejsum L.N. Gresz V. Kwon T.H. Jensen U.B. Frokiaer J. Nielsen S. Am. J.

Ferri et al. (24Ferri D. Mazzone A. Liquori G.E. Cassano G. Svelto M. Calamita G. Hepatology. 2003; 38: 947-957Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) report AQP8 expression in intracellular membranes in mouse liver, including smooth endoplasmic reticulum, subapical vesicles, and mitochondria. Utilizing a mouse AQP8 antibody and liver from a AQP8 knock-out mouse as the negative control, we have shown AQP8 protein expression on the plasma membrane with weak intracellular localization (9Yang B. Song Y. Zhao D. Verkman A.S. Am. J. Physiol. 2005; 288: C1161-C1170Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Immunoblot data here showed AQP8 immunoreactivity in liver homogenate and the plasma membrane (17,000 × g) fraction but not in mitochondrial membranes. Water permeability was compared in mitochondria from wild-type versus AQP8 null mice to define the functional expression of AQP8 in mitochondria. Data from IMM and whole mitochondria showed a high Arrhenius activation energy (9–10 kcal/mol) and a relatively low osmotic water permeability (0.009 cm/s at 10 °C), suggesting lipid-rather than aquaporin-facilitated water transport. It is difficult, however, to interpret absolute Pf values in mitochondria in terms of the presence of AQPs because of the higher water permeability of intracellular, cholesterol-poor membranes compared with cholesterol-rich plasma membranes and because of uncertainties in membrane infoldings and, hence, the validity of the assumption that the mitochondrial vesicles are smooth spheres. In contrast to our measurements here, Calamita et al. (7Calamita G. Ferri D. Gena P. Liquori G.E. Cavalier A. Thomas D. Svelto M. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 17149-17153Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar) report a substantially lower activation energy (3.9–4.9 kcal/mol) in rat mitochondria. They also report higher Pf values of up to 0.05 cm/s, which may be related to their measurements being done at a higher temperature, to differences in IMM size, and/or to the use of an exponential approximation in the computation of Pf, which is not valid for large osmotic gradients. We conclude that the rapid volume equilibration in mitochondria in response to an osmotic gradient is due to its small size (high surface-to-volume ratio) rather than to high intrinsic membrane water permeability. Further, water permeability was similar in mouse and rat mitochondria from different organs and not affected by the deletion of organ-specific aquaporins (AQP4 in brain; AQP1 in kidney, AQP8 in heart). HgCl2 slowed the kinetics of osmotic equilibration comparably in mitochondria from wild-type and AQP8 null mice as well as rat. However, the slowed osmotic equilibration could be accounted for quantitatively by altered mitochondrial size rather than reduced intrinsic membrane water permeability. Together, these data provide direct evidence against aquaporin-facilitated water transport in mitochondria. AQP9, an aquaglyceroporin that transports water and glycerol, was reported to be expressed in rat brain mitochondria (8Amiry-Moghaddam M. Lindland H. Zelenin S. Roberg B.A. Gundersen B.B. Petersen P. Rinvik E. Torgner I.A. Ottersen O.P. FASEB J. 2005; 19: 1459-1467Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Osmotic water and glycerol permeabilities in mitochondria from various rat tissues were compared as a test for functional AQP9 expression in rat brain mitochondria. We did not measure glycerol permeability in brain mitochondria from mice because of recent data suggesting the absence of AQP9 protein in mouse brain (10Rojek A.M. Skowronski M.T. Fuchtbauer E. Frokiaer J. Nielsen S. FASEB J. 2005; 19 (abstr.): A637Google Scholar). Permeabilities from rat brain mitochondria were compared with those from rat kidney and liver mitochondria, the latter organs not expressing an aquaglyceroporin. Neither water nor glycerol permeabilities differed in mitochondria from the various tissues, with the low glycerol permeability coefficient and strong temperature-dependence suggesting lipid-mediated glycerol permeability. In summary, the results here provide functional evidence against a role for aquaporins in mitochondria. Although we believe it unlikely, the possibility cannot be ruled out that non-transporting spliced variants of aquaporins might be present in mitochondria and be involved in non-transporting functions.

We show that in the long bones of newborn mice, VEGF-D and VEGFR-3 are expressed in the osteoblasts of the growing plate. The treatment of primary human osteoblasts with recombinant VEGF-D induces the expression of osteocalcin and the formation of mineralized nodules in a dose-dependent manner. A monoclonal neutralizing antibody, anti-VEGF-D, or silencing of VEGFR-3 by lentiviral-mediated expression of VEGFR-3 small hairpin RNA affects VEGF-D-dependent osteocalcin expression and nodule formation. Moreover, in primary human osteoblasts, VEGF-D expression is under the control of VEGF, and inhibition of VEGF-D/VEGFR-3 signaling, by monoclonal antibodies or VEGFR-3 silencing, affects VEGF-dependent osteoblast differentiation.

During endochondral bone formation, mesenchymal cells differentiate into chondrocytes, which secrete a cartilage template. Chondrocytes in the centers of the cartilage templates become hypertrophic and produce vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) 2The abbreviations used are: VEGF, vascular endothelial growth factor; VEGFR, vascular endothelial growth factor receptor; shRNA, small hairpin RNA; mAb, monoclonal antibody; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; RT, reverse transcription. 2The abbreviations used are: VEGF, vascular endothelial growth factor; VEGFR, vascular endothelial growth factor receptor; shRNA, small hairpin RNA; mAb, monoclonal antibody; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; RT, reverse transcription. that stimulates vascular invasion of the cartilage template. Upon this process, the hypertrophic chondrocytes die through apoptosis and are replaced by osteoblasts brought in from the bone collar (1Karsenty G. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 3037-3051Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar, 2Wagner E.F. Karsenty G. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2001; 11: 527-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). The interplay between chondrocytes and osteoblasts at the growth plate determines the longitudinal growth of long bones. Osteoblasts are responsible for matrix deposition and bone mineralization. Early during their differentiation, osteoblasts express RUNX2 (also known as CBFA1), which is held inactive by Twist proteins (3Bialek P. Kern B. Yang X. Schrock M. Sosic D. Hong N. Wu H. Yu K. Ornitz D.M. Olson E.N. Justice M.J. Karsenty G. Dev. Cell. 2004; 6: 423-435Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (527) Google Scholar). Later, osteoblasts express the specific marker osteocalcin, which is required for bone mineralization (4Ducy P. Schinke T. Karsenty G. Science. 2000; 289: 1501-1504Crossref PubMed Scopus (887) Google Scholar). Several growth factors expressed in the growth plate including epidermal growth factor, members of fibroblast growth factor family, insulin growth factor-1, platelet growth factor, members of the transforming growth factor-β family, Indian hedgehog, and VEGF are involved in cell proliferation and differentiation during bone formation (1Karsenty G. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 3037-3051Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar, 2Wagner E.F. Karsenty G. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2001; 11: 527-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar, 5Gerber H.P.

VEGF was first identified as an angiogenic factor that is expressed in different splicing forms. It binds and activates VEGFR-1 (also known as Flt-1) and VEGFR-2 (also known as KDR or Flk1) on endothelial cells, and their expression is required for vascular development and adult angiogenesis (6Ferrara N.

During skeletal development, VEGF has been shown to play a role in blood vessel invasion that is essential for coupling resorption of cartilage with mineralization of the extracellular matrix and bone formation (8Gerber H.P.

In mouse femur fractures, treatment with exogenous VEGF enhanced not only blood vessel formation but also ossification and new bone maturation, whereas VEGF inhibition decreased bone formation and callus mineralization (19Street J.

Bone. 2002; 30: 472-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar), no functional data of the activity of VEGFRs in osteoblasts has been reported. During mouse development, the expression of another member of the VEGF family, VEGF-D, was detected in the periosteum/osteoblast layer of the developing vertebral column, the limb buds, and the dental mesenchyme close to the enamel epithelium (20Avantaggiato V. Acampora D. Orlandini M. Oliviero S. Simeone A. Mech. Dev. 1998; 73: 221-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Because in mouse VEGF-D only recognizes murine VEGFR-3 (21Baldwin M.E.

We show that osteoblasts of the long bones of newborn mice and primary human osteoblasts express VEGFR-3. Osteoblasts treated with recombinant VEGF-D respond with VEGFR-3 autophosphorylation, osteocalcin expression, and nodule formation. Moreover, VEGF treatment induces VEGF-D expression in these cells. Accordingly, the inactivation of VEGF-D activity by neutralizing antibodies or VEGFR-3 silencing inhibited both VEGF- and VEGF-D-dependent nodule formation in osteoblasts. Our data demonstrate the involvement of VEGF-D in maturation and regulation of osteoblastic activity via VEGFR-3. Primary Human Osteoblast Cultures—Bone samples were obtained from 10 women and 4 men (aged 56–78 years, with a mean age of 66 years) who underwent total hip replacement surgery for degenerative joint disease. After extensive washes of trabecular bone explants, small bone chips were placed in flasks with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen), 2 mm l-glutamine, 50 units/ml penicillin, and 50 μg/ml streptomycin. Cultures were incubated at 37 °C in a humidified, 5% CO2 atmosphere. For differentiation assays, osteoblasts were seeded in 6-well plates. Upon confluence, recombinant human VEGF-D (0–50 ng/ml) with or without the mouse monoclonal anti-human VEGF-D-neutralizing antibody (monoclonal antibody (mAb) 3.11A25) at a concentration of 5–36 μg/ml was added. Medium was changed every 2 days. The mineralized nodule formation was determined after 15 days by using Alizarin Red S staining as described previously (29Frediani B. Spreafico A. Capperucci C.

Immunofluorescent Microscopy—For histological analysis, newborn Swiss mice were sacrificed, and limbs were dissected and embedded in Tissue-Tek® OCT™ compound. 10-μm cryostat sections were cut and fixed in 3% paraformaldehyde for 20 min at room temperature. Human osteoblasts were grown on glass coverslips and, after treatment, fixed in 3% paraformaldehyde for 15 min at room temperature. For permeabilization, cryostat sections were incubated with 0.5% Triton X-100 in PBS for 5 min at 4 °C. For the staining of cultured human osteoblasts, cells were not permeabilized. Specimens were washed twice in PBS, blocked with 1% bovine serum albumin in PBS for 1 h at room temperature, and incubated for 1 h at 37 °C with the following primary antibodies: rabbit polyclonal anti-VEGF-D (30Marconcini L.

After washing, specimens were incubated for 1 h at 37°C with Alexa Fluor 568 or Alexa Fluor 488 secondary antibodies (Molecular Probes), and mounted in Mowiol 4-88 (Calbiochem). Fluorescent images were captured using a Leica TCS SP2 laser scanning confocal microscope. Cloning, Purification, and Folding of Recombinant Human VEGF-D—To generate the His6 epitope-tagged human VEGF-D (amino acids 90–203, GenBank™/EBI Data Bank accession number NM_004469), a cDNA clone containing the complete sequence of the VEGF-D gene (31Rocchigiani M.

The PCR fragment was then cloned into the NdeI SalI sites of the bacterial expression vector pET-22b (Novagen). The construct was checked by automated sequencing. VEGF-D-transformed BL21-DE3 Escherichia coli cells were grown for 3 h at 37°C after isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside induction, pelleted, and solubilized in 6 m guanidium chloride. VEGF-D was purified by immobilized metal affinity chromatography under denaturing conditions (8 m urea) in the presence of 1 mm Tris-(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine-HCl using an AKTA purifier (Amersham Biosciences). To obtain a VEGF-D dimer, the monomer (0.25 mg/ml) was dialyzed against: (a)6 m urea, 0.1 m NaH2PO4, 10 mm Tris-HCl, 5 mm GSH, pH 8.5; (b) 50 mm Tris-HCl, 5 mm NaCl, 0.5 m l-arginine, 5 mm GSH, 1 mm GSSG, 2 m urea, pH 8.5; (c) in the same buffer as b without 2 m urea; (d)50mm Tris-HCl, pH 8. Each dialysis was performed for 16 h. To eliminate aggregate forms, VEGF-D was loaded onto a His-TRAP affinity column in non-denaturing conditions and eluted with 250 mm imidazole. Imidazole was removed on a HiTrap desalting column, and the dimer formation was checked by gel filtration using a Superdex 75 HR column. All the columns were from Amersham Biosciences.TABLE 1Oligonucleotide sequences used in real-time quantitative RT-PCR and VEGF-D cloning in pET22bGeneSequenceVEGFR-2F 5′—ACCCACCCCCAGAAATAAAA—3′R 5′—CACAACCAGAGAGACCACA—3′VEGFR-3F 5′—CAACAGACCCACACAGAACT—3′R 5′—TTTCCATCCTTGTACCACTG—3′OsteocalcinF 5′—GTGCAGAGTCCAGCAAG—3′R 5′—GATAGGCCTCCTGAAAGC—3′RUNX2F 5′—CCCCACGACAACCGCACCAT—3′R 5′—CACTCCGGCCCACAAATCTC—3′GAPDHF 5′—GAAGGTGAAGGTCGGAGTC—3′R 5′—GAAGATGGTGATGGGATTTC—3′Lentiviral vectorF 5′—ACCTGAAAGCGAAAGGGAAAC—3′R 5′—CACCCATCTCTCTCCTTCTAGCC—3′VEGF-DF 5′—GAGAGAGACATATGGCGGCAACTTTCTATGACA—3′R 5′—GAGAGAGTCGACTCAGTGATGGTGATGGTGATGG—ATAATTGAGTATGGATGGCG—3′ Open table in a new tab Monoclonal Antibody Production and Characterization—mAbs against human recombinant VEGF-D were generated using a standard fusion protocol (32Campbell G.H.

Antibody-secreting hybridomas were cloned and inoculated into pristane-primed BALB/c mice for production of ascitic fluid. The isotypes were determined using the mouse monoclonal antibody isotyping kit (Amersham Biosciences). Antibodies were purified by affinity chromatography and characterized by immunoprecipitation and cell proliferation assays. Cell Proliferation and Viability Assays—Human umbilical vein endothelial cells were grown in M199 culture medium containing 20% fetal bovine serum and growth supplements. 5 × 103 cells were plated in a 96-well plate and starved for 24 h in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 2% fetal bovine serum and 1% bovine serum albumin. Cells were treated with 25 ng/ml VEGF-D in the presence of different concentrations of an anti-VEGF-D mAb and 0.5 μCi/well [methyl-3H]thymidine (Amersham Biosciences). After 20 h, cell proliferation was measured as thymidine uptake by a β-counter. The assays for cell viability were performed by using thiazolyl blue tetrazolium bromide (Sigma) according to manufacturer's instructions. Immunoprecipitation and Immunoblotting Assays—For osteoblast immunoprecipitation analysis, cultures were starved in serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 1% bovine serum albumin for 24 h. Before stimulation, cells were incubated with 0.1 mm Na3VO4 for 10 min to inhibit phosphatase activity. Cells were stimulated for 30 min with 25 ng/ml VEGF-D at 37 °C, washed with ice-cold PBS containing 0.1 mm Na3VO4, and lysed in 1 ml of lysis buffer (50 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 10 mm NaH2PO4, 100 mm NaF, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm Na3VO4, protease inhibitors, Sigma). Cell lysates were incubated on ice for 10 min and centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 15 min, and the supernatants were incubated with anti-VEGFR-3 antibodies. For immunoprecipitation analysis of VEGF family growth factors, HEK293 stable clones expressing human VEGF164, VEGF-C, and VEGF-D were generated. 3M. Bardelli, unpublished data. 400 μl of supernatant from serum-starved cells were immunoprecipitated with 2 μg of mAb 3.11A25 in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P40. Immunoprecipitates were analyzed by 6–15% SDS-PAGE. Immunoblot analyses were performed as described previously (33Orlandini M. Semboloni S. Oliviero S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 44650-44656Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The following primary antibodies were used: mouse monoclonal anti-VEGFR-3, anti-phosphotyrosine, anti-VEGF, and anti-β-tubulin (Santa Cruz Biotechnology); anti-phospho-p44 MAPK and anti-p44/42 MAPK (Cell Signaling); anti-VEGF-C (R&D Systems); and anti-VEGF-D (mAb 197). The blots were washed, incubated with horseradish peroxidase-labeled secondary antibodies, and developed by using the enhanced chemiluminescence substrate (Amersham Biosciences). VEGFR-3 RNA Interference—Small hairpin (shRNA) cassette was cloned, and the recombinant lentiviruses were produced as described previously (34Zippo A. De Robertis A. Bardelli M. Galvagni F. Oliviero S. Blood. 2004; 103: 4536-4544Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Briefly, oligonucleotides coding for human VEGFR-3 and unrelated shRNA were designed to contain a sense strand 5′-GAGACAAGGACAGCGAGGACA-3′ (VEGFR-3 D clone), 5′-GTACATCAAGGCACGCATCGA-3′ (VEGFR-3 F clone), and 5′-GCCACAAGTTCAGCGTGTC-3′ (unrelated) followed by a spacer (5′-TTCAAGAGA-3′) and their reverse complementary strand followed by five thymidines as an RNA polymerase III transcriptional stop signal. The complementary oligonucleotides were phosphorylated, annealed, and cloned into the lentiviral vector. HEK293 cells were transiently transfected using PolyFect transfection reagent (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The lentiviruses were harvested 24 and 48 h later and filtered through 0.22-μm pore cellulose acetate filters. Recombinant lentiviruses were concentrated by ultracentrifugation for 2 h at 50,000 × g. Vector infectivity was evaluated by infecting cells with a green fluorescent protein vector and titrating shRNA-expressing virus by real-time quantitative RT-PCR of a common lentiviral genome region when compared with the green fluorescent protein vector. Real-time Quantitative RT-PCR Analysis—Total RNA was isolated from cells by the guanidinium thiocyanate method, quantified, and integrity was tested by gel electrophoresis. The gene expression analysis was performed using a LightCycler apparatus, and data were analyzed with the LightCycler software version 3.5 (Roche Applied Science). The RT-PCR reactions were set up in microcapillary tubes using the Light-Cycler RNA amplification kit SYBR Green I (Roche Applied Science) following the manufacturer's instructions. For each sample, triplicate determinations were made, and the gene expression was normalized to the amount of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase on the same sample. The primer pairs used are reported in Table 1. Comparison of VEGF-D and VEGFR-3 Expression in Newborn Mice—Immunohistochemical staining for murine VEGF-D performed on neonatal radius showed the expression of VEGF-D corresponding to osteoblasts adjacent to hypertrophic chondrocytes (Fig. 1C). To verify whether VEGF-D expression was compatible with a role in bone formation, we analyzed the expression of its receptor VEGFR-3, as in mouse VEGF-D only recognizes VEGFR-3 (21Baldwin M.E. Catimel B. Nice E.C. Roufail S. Hall N.E. Stenvers K.L. Karkkainen M.J. Alitalo K. Stacker S.A. Achen M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 19166-19171Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). VEGFR-3 showed expression in the growth plate at the interface between the forming bone and the terminal hypertrophic chondrocytes (Fig. 1). This is a bone-developing region characterized by new blood vessel formation and differentiating osteoblasts. VEGFR-3 is transiently expressed in endothelial cells during active angiogenesis (22Dumont D.J. Jussila L. Taipale J. Lymboussaki A. Mustonen T. Pajusola K. Breitman M. Alitalo K. Science. 1998; 282: 946-949Crossref PubMed Scopus (683) Google Scholar, 27Kubo H. Fujiwara T. Jussila L. Hashi H. Ogawa M. Shimizu K. Awane M. Sakai Y. Takabayashi A. Alitalo K. Yamaoka Y.

Pathol. 2001; 195: 490-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Consistent with this, we observed low levels of VEGFR-3 expression in endothelial cells in the radius of new born mice, reflecting the fact that a peak of angiogenesis in the growing bone takes place before birth. Double staining between VEGFR-3 and PECAM1 (CD31), a marker of endothelial cells, revealed a partial overlapping of these signals, demonstrating that VEGFR-3 is still expressed in endothelial cells at this stage (Fig. 1, D–F). A more consistent VEGFR-3 signal was observed in osteocalcin positive cells (Fig. 1, G–L). These data demonstrate that VEGFR-3 is expressed in mouse osteoblasts. VEGF-D Activates VEGFR-3 on Primary Human Osteoblasts—To address whether VEGF-D/VEGFR-3 signaling plays a functional role in osteoblasts, we obtained from trabecular bone explants primary human osteoblasts and analyzed VEGF-D response on these cells. We detected VEGFR-3 expression in primary human osteoblasts by immunofluorescence analysis and by Western blot (Fig. 2, A–D), whereas we could not detect VEGFR-2 in these cells or VEGFR-3 in fibroblasts (data not shown). To analyze VEGFR-3 autophosphorylation, human osteoblasts were treated with recombinant VEGF-D, and whole cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with an antibody recognizing VEGFR-3 C terminus and immunoblotted with anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies. This analysis revealed that VEGF-D treatment induced VEGFR-3 autophosphorylation in osteoblasts (Fig. 2D). VEGFR-3 activation was leading to an intracellular signaling cascade as we observed that VEGF-D treatment was followed by an increase of the phosphorylation of the intracellular protein ERK1/2 (Fig. 2E). These experiments demonstrate that VEGF-D recognizes and activates VEGFR-3 expressed in primary human osteoblasts. VEGF-D Induces Nodule Formation and Osteocalcin Expression—To investigate whether VEGF-D affects osteoblast differentiation, primary human osteoblasts were grown in complete medium for 14 days in the presence of different concentrations of VEGF-D. As shown in Fig. 3, VEGF-D significantly increased the number of mineralized nodules in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 3A). In addition, the nodules grew bigger and better mineralized than those of the control cultures that showed less and poorly mineralized nodules (Fig. 3B). To verify whether the neutralization of VEGF-D activity affects osteoblast differentiation, we used the mAb 3.11A25 (isotype IgG2a) able to selectively immunoprecipitate VEGF-D (Fig. 3C) and to inhibit VEGF-D-dependent proliferation of endothelial cells (Fig. 3D). The treatment of osteoblast cultures with mAb 3.11.A25 decreased nodule formation to values of untreated cells, whereas a non-correlated antibody did not influence nodule formation even at high concentrations (Fig. 3E). Importantly, the treatment of osteoblasts for 14 days with high concentrations of mAb 3.11A25 did not alter osteoblast viability (Fig. 3F). Taken together, these data demonstrated that VEGF-D induces osteoblasts to form mineralization nodules. Quantitative real-time RT-PCR analysis of the expression of RUNX2, a marker of early differentiation of osteoblast, and osteocalcin, a marker of late osteoblast differentiation, showed that VEGF-D treatment did not influence RUNX2 expression, whereas osteocalcin mRNA was significantly increased in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 4A). Moreover, osteocalcin induction was inhibited by the anti-VEGF-D-neutralizing antibody (Fig. 4B). Immunofluorescence analysis also showed that VEGF-D treatment increased osteocalcin secretion with respect to untreated cells (Fig. 4, C–F), demonstrating that VEGF-D plays a role in osteoblast differentiation.FIGURE 4VEGF-D treatment stimulates osteocalcin production, a gene related to osteoblast differentiation.

Primary human osteoblasts infected with either lentivirus expressing VEGFR-3 shRNA, but not an unrelated shRNA, showed a reduced VEGFR-3 protein expression and affected VEGF-D-dependent ERK1/2 activation (Fig. 5A). Osteoblast knockdown for VEGFR-3 showed significant impairment of nodule formation and osteocalcin production following VEGF-D treatment (Fig. 5, B and C). As VEGF plays a direct role in osteoblast migration, probably via the activation of VEGFR-1 (14Mayr-Wohlfart U. Waltenberger J. Hausser H. Kessler S. Gunther K.-P. Dehio C. Puhl W. Brenner R.E. Bone. 2002; 30: 472-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar), to provide a functional link between VEGF- and VEGF-D-dependent osteoblast differentiation, we analyzed whether VEGF-D expression in osteoblasts depends on VEGF signaling. Quantitative real-time RT-PCR analysis revealed that following VEGF treatment, osteoblasts responded with an increased expression of VEGF-D, demonstrating that in osteoblasts, VEGF-D expression is under the control of VEGF (Fig. 6A). To analyze whether VEGF-D plays a role in VEGF-dependent osteoblast differentiation, we treated osteoblasts with VEGF in the presence of the monoclonal antibody inhibiting VEGF-D activity and measured the nodule formation induced by VEGF. VEGF treatment of primary human osteoblasts induced a significant number of mineralization nodules. The pretreatment of these cultures with VEGF-D-neutralizing antibodies efficiently inhibited VEGF-dependent nodule formation (Fig. 6B). This inhibition specifically affected the VEGFR-3 signaling as we also observed inhibition of VEGF-dependent nodules formation in cells silenced for VEGFR-3 (Fig. 6, C and D). Together, these results demonstrate that VEGF induces nodule formation in osteoblasts via the activation of the VEGF-D/VEGFR-3 signaling. This study reveals that VEGF-D/VEGFR-3 signaling induces primary human osteoblast differentiation. Examination of long bones of newborn mice showed that VEGF-D is expressed together with VEGFR-3 in the osteoblasts of the growth plate, suggesting that VEGF-D/VEGFR-3 signaling might contribute to the bone formation in vivo by an autocrine activation of osteoblasts during their maturation. Accordingly, we found that VEGFR-3 is expressed in primary human osteoblasts and VEGF-D stimulates their differentiation measured as osteocalcin induction and mineralized nodule formation. Furthermore, we demonstrated, by VEGFR-3 silencing, that VEGFR-3 signaling plays a functional role in VEGF-D-dependent osteoblast maturation. Because in mouse VEGFR-3 is expressed in osteoblasts and VEGF-D binds only this receptor (21Baldwin M.E. Catimel B. Nice E.C. Roufail S. Hall N.E. Stenvers K.L. Karkkainen M.J. Alitalo K.

VEGF-D induces angiogenesis, lymphangiogenesis, as well as metastatic spread of tumors via lymphatic vessels activating VEGFR-3 on vascular and lymphatic endothelial cells (30Marconcini L. Marchiò S. Morbidelli L. Cartocci E. Albini A. Ziche M. Bussolino F. Oliviero S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 9671-9676Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar, 36Achen M.G.

Besides playing a role in lymphatic vessel homeostasis, VEGFR-3 is implicated in the remodeling of the primary vascular network, and in reorganizing the integrity of endothelial vessels during angiogenesis (22Dumont D.J.

Galvagni F. Bardelli M. Bussolino F. Oliviero S. Blood. 2005; 106: 3423-3431Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). The data presented in this report demonstrate that, in addition to playing a biological function in endothelial cells, VEGF-D/VEGFR-3 signaling is also implicated in osteoblast differentiation. Expression analysis on primary human osteoblasts demonstrated that VEGF-D induces the expression of osteocalcin, a late marker of differentiation, whereas it has no effect on the early marker RUNX2. RT-PCR analysis in these cells revealed that the inhibitors of RUNX2, Twist 1 and Twist 2, expressed early during osteoblast differentiation (3Bialek P. Kern B. Yang X. Schrock M. Sosic D. Hong N. Wu H. Yu K. Ornitz D.M. Olson E.N. Justice M.J. Karsenty G. Dev. Cell. 2004; 6: 423-435Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (527) Google Scholar), are already down-regulated in osteoblasts before VEGF-D treatment. 4M. Orlandini, unpublished observation. These data therefore suggest that VEGF-D/VEGFR-3 signaling is not involved in the activation of RUNX2 function but must be involved in the activation of other yet unknown regulator(s) of osteoblast differentiation that act at a later stage of osteoblast maturation. This is also confirmed by the fact that VEGF-D induced mineralization in these cells. Hypertrophic chondrocytes secrete a number of growth factors including VEGF, which orchestrate blood vessel formation, chondrocyte maturation, the differentiation of osteoblasts forming the mineralized bone collar, as well as the recruitment of osteoclasts into hypertrophic cartilage (Ref. 16Zelzer E. McLean W. Ng Y.S. Fukai N. Reginato A.M. Lovejoy S. D'Amore P.A. Olsen B.R. Development (Camb.). 2002; 129: 1893-1904Crossref PubMed Google Scholar and references therein). In line with these experiments, our results are consistent with a model in which VEGF acts early on bone differentiation by inducing vessel formation, osteoblast recruitment to the growth plate, and also stimulating VEGF-D production in osteoblasts. VEGF-D in turn acts as a downstream effector of VEGF with autocrine activity on osteoblasts. Therefore these two factors contribute to the process of timely coordinated osteoblast differentiation. These results also imply that VEGF, probably acting on VEGFR-1, stimulates a different cellular response than VEGF-D acting on VEGFR-3. A similar conclusion was previously reached by the analysis of sinusoidal endothelial cells in which VEGFR-1 induced these cells to produce the hepatocyte growth factor, whereas VEGFR-2 induced their proliferation (39LeCouter J. Moritz D.R. Li B. Phillips G.L. Liang X.H. Gerber H.P. Hillan K.J. Ferrara N. Science. 2003; 299: 890-893Crossref PubMed Scopus (553) Google Scholar). Further analysis of the downstream signaling from these two receptors might enlighten the physiological differences between these two receptors in osteoblasts. Our data suggest that VEGF-D plays a role in the development of long bones. During mouse development, VEGF-D expression was also detected in the periosteum layer of the developing vertebral column and in the dental mesenchyme close to the enamel epithelium, where dentin and enamel matrices are deposited (20Avantaggiato V. Acampora D. Orlandini M. Oliviero S. Simeone A. Mech. Dev. 1998; 73: 221-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), suggesting that VEGF-D might also play a role in intramembranous bone formation. We thank Beatrice Grandi for technical support."
https://openalex.org/W2050039498,"Nerve growth factor (NGF) and the ubiquitous second messenger cyclic AMP (cAMP) are both implicated in neuronal differentiation. Multiple studies indicate that NGF signals to at least a subset of its targets via cAMP, but the link between NGF and cAMP has remained elusive. Here, we have described the use of small molecule inhibitors to differentiate between the two known sources of cAMP in mammalian cells, bicarbonate- and calcium-responsive soluble adenylyl cyclase (sAC) and G protein-regulated transmembrane adenylyl cyclases. These inhibitors, along with sAC-specific small interfering RNA, reveal that sAC is uniquely responsible for the NGF-elicited rise in cAMP and is essential for the NGF-induced activation of the small G protein Rap1 in PC12 cells. In contrast and as expected, transmembrane adenylyl cyclase-generated cAMP is responsible for Rap1 activation by the G protein-coupled receptor ligand PACAP (pituitary adenylyl cyclase-activating peptide). These results identify sAC as a mediator of NGF signaling and reveal the existence of distinct pathways leading to cAMP-dependent signal transduction."

These mitochondrial outer membrane proteins contain a GTPase domain and two or three regions with hydrophobic heptad repeats, but little is known about how these domains interact to mediate mitochondrial fusion. To address this issue, we have analyzed the yeast mitofusin Fzo1p and find that mutation of any of the three heptad repeat regions (HRN, HR1, and HR2) leads to a null allele. Specific pairs of null alleles show robust complementation, indicating that functional domains need not exist on the same molecule. Biochemical analysis indicates that this complementation is due to Fzo1p oligomerization mediated by multiple domain interactions. Moreover, we find that two non-overlapping protein fragments, one consisting of HRN/GTPase and the other consisting of HR1/HR2, can form a complex that reconstitutes Fzo1p fusion activity.

Importantly, the mitochondrial fusion machinery is dedicated solely to mitochondrial fusion and does not include SNARE 2The abbreviations used are: SNARE, soluble NSF attachment protein receptors; HR, heptad repeat; SD, synthetic media with 2% dextrose; YP, yeast extract peptone; mito-GFP, mitochondrially targeted green fluorescent protein; mito-DsRed, mitochondrially targeted red fluorescent protein from Discosoma; HA, hemagglutinin. proteins or NSF (N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive protein), which mediate most other intracellular membrane fusion events. Thus, mitochondrial fusion likely involves a unique mechanism. There are three essential components of the fusion pathway in yeast. The yeast mitofusin Fzo1p is a 98-kDa transmembrane GTPase uniformly distributed in the mitochondria outer membrane (1Hermann G.J. Thatcher J.W. Mills J.P. Hales K.G. Fuller M.T. Nunnari J. Shaw J.M.

Chem. 1998; 273: 20150-20155Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). Both the N- and C-terminal portions of Fzo1p are oriented toward the cytosol, in position to mediate important steps during fusion (1Hermann G.J. Thatcher J.W. Mills J.P. Hales K.G. Fuller M.T. Nunnari J. Shaw J.M. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 359-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar, 2Rapaport D. Brunner M. Neupert W. Westermann B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20150-20155Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). Mgm1p is a dynamin-related protein in the mitochondrial intermembrane space (10Sesaki H. Southard S.M. Yaffe M.P. Jensen R.E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 2342-2356Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar, 11Wong E.D. Wagner J.A. Gorsich S.W. McCaffery J.M. Shaw J.M. Nunnari J. J.

Cell Biol. 2003; 160: 303-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). It remains unclear if Mgm1p possesses the membrane severing activity of other dynamin family members, and if so, how this activity relates to its requirement for fusion. The third component of the fusion pathway is Ugo1p, a 58-kDa protein that spans the outer membrane once and interacts with both Fzo1p and Mgm1p (10Sesaki H. Southard S.M. Yaffe M.P. Jensen R.E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 2342-2356Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar, 12Wong E.D. Wagner J.A. Scott S.V. Okreglak V. Holewinske T.J. Cassidy-Stone A. Nunnari J. J.

Jensen R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 28298-28303Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). In this capacity, Ugo1p may anchor a fusion complex that coordinates the mitochondrial outer and inner membranes during fusion. Fzo1p is the best candidate to directly mediate fusion of the mitochondrial outer membrane. Unlike Mgm1p, it is positioned in the outer membrane and unlike Ugo1p its requisite role is conserved from yeast to mammals. In addition, Fzo1p has three hydrophobic heptad repeat (HR) regions that are predicted to form coiled-coils. Heptad repeat regions are directly involved in SNARE and Class I viral membrane fusion. In both cases, membrane fusion is driven when a trans complex that spans both membranes undergoes a structural transition to a highly stable fusogenic conformation. These fusogenic structures use coiled-coil-like helical bundles to position the two membranes in close apposition, leading to fusion (15Bonifacino J.S. Glick B.S. Cell. 2004; 116: 153-166Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1313) Google Scholar, 16Eckert D.M. Kim P.S. Annu. Rev.

Hughson F.M. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2003; 19: 493-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). Given these similarities, it is likely that the heptad repeat regions form interactions critical for mitochondrial fusion. Indeed, the mammalian mitofusins Mfn1 and Mfn2 form homotypic and heterotypic complexes, and several intermolecular interactions have been identified. Mfn1 HR2 is known to form a trans anti-parallel, dimeric coiled-coil that tethers mitochondria together (19Koshiba T. Detmer S.A. Kaiser J.T. Chen H. McCaffery J.M. Chan D.C. Science. 2004; 305: 858-862Crossref PubMed Scopus (677) Google Scholar). There is also evidence that Mfn1 HR1 and HR2 interact with each other (20Rojo M. Legros F. Chateau D. Lombes A. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 1663-1674Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, Fzo/mitofusins have similarity to dynamins, a family of large membrane-associated GTPases characterized by oligomerization-stimulated GTP hydrolysis and multiple inter- and intramolecular interactions (21Praefcke G.J. McMahon H.T. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 5: 133-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (1129) Google Scholar). It has not been established if Fzo1p forms similar intermolecular interactions that contribute to mitochondrial fusion. In this study, we show that Fzo1p functions as an oligomer during mitochondrial fusion. We demonstrate that each of the Fzo1p heptad repeats is essential and that the GTPase domains and heptad repeats from different Fzo1p molecules within an oligomer function together to mediate fusion. Finally, we define a novel interaction between the HRN/GTPase and HR1/HR2 regions of Fzo1p that is essential for mitochondrial fusion. Media and Yeast Genetic Techniques—Standard genetic techniques and media were used. SD and YP media supplemented with either 2% dextrose (YPD) or 3% glycerol (YPG) were prepared as described previously (22Gunthrie C. Fink G. Guide to Yeast Genetics and Molecular Biology. 1991; (Academic Press, San Diego, CA)Google Scholar). DCY538 (MATa, ura3–52, his3Δ200, leu2Δ1, trp1Δ63, lys2Δ202, fzo1::HIS3, leu2:: GPD-mitoGFP-LEU2, pRS416-FZO1) was derived from JSY2287 (kindly provided by J. Shaw) (1Hermann G.J. Thatcher J.W. Mills J.P. Hales K.G. Fuller M.T. Nunnari J. Shaw J.M. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 359-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar) by integration of BstEII-linearized EG686 (pRS405 plus mito-GFP) into the leu2Δ1 locus. DCY328 (MATα, ura3–52, his3Δ200, leu2Δ1, trp1Δ63, fzo1::HIS3, rho0) was derived from JSY2793 (1Hermann G.J. Thatcher J.W. Mills J.P. Hales K.G. Fuller M.T. Nunnari J. Shaw J.M. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 359-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar) by selecting for the loss of pRS414-fzo1–1. Because the loss of mtDNA in fzo1Δ yeast is a non-revertible phenotype, a plasmid-shuffle strategy was used to generate yeast strains for structure-function and intragenic allelic complementation analyses. Briefly, DCY538, a rho+ yeast strain containing a chromosomal deletion of FZO1 covered by an FZO1-expressing plasmid (pRS416-FZO1), was transformed with a plasmid encoding an FZO1 under TRP1 selection (structure-function experiments) or two FZO1 plasmids under TRP1 and LYS2 selection (intragenic complementation experiments). The transformation plates were replica-plated, and the pRS416-FZO1 plasmid was removed by counterselection with 5-fluoroorotic acid. The resulting yeast colonies were replica-plated onto YPD and YPG plates. The glycerol growth phenotype was reproducibly evident after 3 days of growth. In the intragenic complementation experiments, for example, all colonies showed growth on YPG plates when a pair of null alleles were complemented. For quantitative serial dilution and morphological analysis, representative colonies were isolated and re-analyzed. The possibility of recombination events was excluded by the presence of many non-complementing pairs of alleles (for example, fzo1(V172P) and fzo1(L819P)), the robust complementation between non-overlapping fragments (Fzo1p-HRN/GTPase plus Fzo1p-HR1/HR2), and the reproducibility of the glycerol growth phenotype among all colonies at the replica plating stage. In addition, in the complementation experiment involving Fzo1p-HRN/GTPase and Fzo1p-HR1/HR2, Western blot analysis confirmed the expression of the proper fragments. Mitochondrial Morphology and Glycerol Growth Analysis—Yeast strains expressing the indicated FZO1 constructs were generated through a plasmid shuffle strategy and grown at 30 °C in appropriate SD medium overnight. Cultures were diluted 1:20 in fresh YPD medium and counted live during logarithmic growth. For glycerol growth assays, cultures grown overnight in SD medium were pelleted, resuspended at a density of 1 A600 unit/ml and diluted 1:5 six times in YP. 3 μl of the dilutions was spotted to plates and grown for 2 days (YPD) or 4 days (YPG) at 30 °C. Plasmid Construction—pRS414-9XMyc-FZO1 (EG36) was constructed as follows. The FZO1 terminator was amplified from genomic DNA using the oligonucleotides Eg5 (CTCTATACGAAGGAACCGTGGCTC) and Eg6 (GCAGAATTCTTGTTGTCTTTTAAATGGAG) and cloned as a ClaI/EcoRI fragment. The FZO1 coding sequence was cloned as a SalI and ClaI fragment using the FZO1 forward primer Eg3 (ACCATGGTCGACTCTGAAGGAAAACAACAATTC) to engineer a SalI restriction site following the initiator ATG. The FZO1 5′-untranslated region was amplified using the primers Eg1 (GCAGGTACCAAGGAGTTTGTGTCGTTTTTCAC) and Eg2 (CAGAGTCGACCATGGTCGTTAAATGAGCCTACCGTTTTGCC) and cloned as a KpnI/SalI fragment. These fragments were all subcloned into pRS414 (Stratagene) to yield pRS414-FZO1 (EG32). Next, a 9XMyc cassette was cloned into the SalI site to yield pRS414-9XMyc-FZO1 (EG36). The entire 9XMyc-FZO1 cassette was moved as a KpnI (blunted)/EcoRI fragment into SmaI and EcoRI sites of pRS317 to generate pRS317-9XMyc-FZO1 (EG197). The 9XMyc cassette in EG36 was replaced with a 6XHA cassette (XhoI/SalI fragment) to generate pRS414-6XHA-FZO1 (EG594). The entire 6XHA-FZO1 fragment was moved as a KpnI/EcoRI fragment into pRS416, resulting in pRS416-6XHA-FZO1 (EG600). pRS416 plus 6XHA-FZO1-HR1/HR2 (residues 416–855) was generated using the primer Eg253 (GCAGTCGACCATTATCATAATGAAAATG). pRS414-9XMyc-FZO1-HRN/GTPase-(1–415) was generated with the primer Eg226 (GCAATCGATTGGCAATTCATCTCCGTT). Mutations were initially generated in the pRS414-9XMyc-FZO1 vector with the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) or by subcloning PCR products containing the indicated mutations. Primer sequences are available upon request. Mating Assay—The indicated yeast strains were grown overnight in the appropriate SD medium, mixed by gently centrifuging together and incubated in YPD at 30 °C for 5 h. The cells were then fixed for 10 min with 3.7% formaldehyde and washed four times with 1 ml of phosphate-buffered saline. Large budded zygotes were scored for the complete overlap of the mito-GFP and mito-DsRed signals. Plasmids were expressed in DCY1440 (MATα, his3Δ200, met15Δ0, trp1Δ63, ura3Δ0, dnm1::HIS5, fzo1::KANMX6, lue2::GPD mito-DsRed-LEU2) and DCY1553 (MATa, his3Δ200, met15Δ0, trp1Δ63, ura3Δ0, dnm1::HIS5, fzo1::KANMX6, leu2::GPD mito-GFP-LEU2). DCY1451 (MATα, his3Δ200, met15Δ0, trp1Δ63, ura3Δ0, dnm1::HIS5, leu2::GPD mito-DsRed-LEU2) and DCY2312 (MATa, his3-, met15Δ0, ura3Δ0, dnm1::kanMX6, leu2::GPD mito-GFP-LEU2) were used for the two FZO1 dnm1Δ strains. Immunoprecipitations—9XMyc- and 6XHA-tagged Fzo1p constructs were expressed in a rho0 fzo1Δ strain (EG328). The use of a rho0 strain eliminated differences in mtDNA levels supported by functional and null alleles of FZO1. Overnight cultures were grown in the appropriate SD medium, diluted into YPD and harvested at A600 ∼1.5. Then, ∼50 A600 units of cells was disrupted by glass bead lysis (40 s with a vortex mixer, four times) in 500 μl of lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.2% Triton X-100) supplemented with fungal protease inhibitors (Sigma-Aldrich). Lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 5,000 rpm for 5 min and 14,000 rpm for 15 min at 4 °C. A total lysate sample was taken, and 400 μl of the remaining lysate was incubated with to 20 μl (bead volume) of 9E10-conjugated protein A-Sepharose beads (Sigma-Aldrich) for 90 min at 4 °C. The beads were then washed four times with 1 ml of lysis buffer and eluted in SDS gel loading buffer for 5 min at 95 °C. Western blot analysis was performed with 9E10 hybridoma supernatant (anti-Myc) or 12CA5 ascites fluid (anti-HA). Immunofluorescence—The indicated 9XMyc-Fzo1p constructs were introduced in DCY538 by a plasmid shuffle. YPD cultures at ∼1.5 A600 were fixed for 10 min with 3.7% formaldehyde. The cells were washed four times with water and spheroplasted with Zymolyase 100T (ICN). Spheroplasts were permeabilized for 10 min in blocking buffer (phosphate-buffered saline containing 1% bovine serum albumin and 1% Tween 20) and incubated for 1 h with 9E10 hybridoma diluted 1:1 in blocking buffer. After four 5-min washes with blocking buffer, the cells were incubated with a Cy3-conjugated anti-mouse secondary antibody for 1 h. After four 5-min washes, Gel Mount (BioMedia) was added to preserve fluorescence. All incubations were performed at room temperature. Imaging—Images were acquired on a Axiovert 200M microscope (Carl Zeiss MicroImaging, Inc.) equipped with a 100× Plan-Apochromat, numerical aperture 1.4, oil-immersion objective and controlled by Axiovision 4.2 software. Z-stacks were collected at 100- to 200-μm intervals with an ORCA-ER camera (Hamamatsu) at room temperature. Iterative deconvolutions and maximum intensity projections were performed using Axiovision 4.2. Fluorescent images were overlaid with differential interference contrast images set at 50% opacity (Fig. 1) using Adobe Photoshop CS. Identification of Essential Fzo1p Domains—Fzo1p has a bipartite transmembrane domain that resides in the mitochondrial outer membrane and divides the protein into N- and C-terminal regions, both of which face toward the cytosol (Fig. 1A) (1Hermann G.J. Thatcher J.W. Mills J.P. Hales K.G. Fuller M.T. Nunnari J. Shaw J.M. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 359-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar, 2Rapaport D. Brunner M. Neupert W. Westermann B. J.

Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 683-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). The N-terminal region contains a GTPase domain that is required for fusion (1Hermann G.J. Thatcher J.W. Mills J.P. Hales K.G. Fuller M.T. Nunnari J. Shaw J.M. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 359-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar). Fzo1p also contains three domains with hydrophobic heptad repeats. Like other mitofusins, including the mammalian Mfn1 and Mfn2, Fzo1p contains the hydrophobic heptad repeat regions HR1 and HR2, which flank the transmembrane domain (Fig. 1A). However, Fzo1p also contains an additional heptad repeat region near the N terminus that we term HRN. Because the role of these heptad repeats in Fzo1p-mediated mitochondrial fusion has not previously been assessed, we performed a structure-function analysis of Fzo1p HRN, HR1, and HR2. Our analysis made use of the fact that loss of Fzo1p function causes complete fragmentation of the mitochondrial reticulum due to ongoing mitochondrial fission (1Hermann G.J. Thatcher J.W. Mills J.P. Hales K.G. Fuller M.T. Nunnari J. Shaw J.M. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 359-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar, 24Sesaki H. Jensen R.E. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 699-706Crossref PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar). In addition, because mitochondrial fragmentation leads to a secondary loss of mitochondrial DNA, fusion mutants can grow on the fermentable carbon source dextrose but not the non-fermentable carbon source glycerol (1Hermann G.J. Thatcher J.W. Mills J.P. Hales K.G. Fuller M.T. Nunnari J. Shaw J.M. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 359-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar). Thus, we assessed the function of Fzo1p mutants by monitoring mitochondrial morphology and growth on glycerol plates. HR1 is 64 residues long (residues 484–547 as predicted by COILS) and lies between the GTPase domain and transmembrane domain (Fig. 1A) (25Lupas A. Van Dyke M. Stock J. Science. 1991; 252: 1162-1164Crossref PubMed Scopus (3482) Google Scholar). We substituted proline residues along HR1 to disrupt the predicted coiled-coil structure (Y490P, L518P, M525P, and K538P). Proline residues impose a kink in the protein backbone and are often incompatible with a helical fold, although sometimes such substitutions can be tolerated by local distortions in backbone geometry. The mutant fzo1(M525P) retained significant function, whereas fzo1(Y490P), fzo1(L518P), and fzo1(K538P) were strong loss-of-function alleles, incapable of supporting growth on glycerol plates or rescuing fragmentation of the mitochondrial network (Fig. 1, B and C). In addition, we substituted alanine for leucine at two a and d positions, Leu-501 and Leu-504. Bulky hydrophobic residues at the a and d positions of the heptad repeat (abcdefg) form a stable hydrophobic interface between the interacting helices of a coiled coil; their substitution by the smaller residue alanine is predicted to destabilize this interface. Individually, fzo1(L501A) and fzo1(L504A) behaved as mild loss-of-function alleles. However, the double mutant fzo1(L501A,L504A) behaved as a null allele, showing no growth on glycerol and completely fragmented mitochondrial morphology (Fig. 1, B and C). Taken together, our mutagenesis of HR1 generated an allelic series and demonstrated that HR1 is essential for Fzo1p function. In mammalian Mfn1, HR2 forms an anti-parallel dimer that tethers mitochondria together at an early step in fusion (19Koshiba T. Detmer S.A. Kaiser J.T. Chen H. McCaffery J.M. Chan D.C. Science. 2004; 305: 858-862Crossref PubMed Scopus (677) Google Scholar). Proline substitutions in Mfn1 HR2 prevent mitochondrial tethering and block mitochondrial fusion (19Koshiba T. Detmer S.A. Kaiser J.T. Chen H. McCaffery J.M. Chan D.C. Science. 2004; 305: 858-862Crossref PubMed Scopus (677) Google Scholar). Proline substitutions at residues Leu-776, Leu-794, and Leu-802 of Fzo1p HR2 (residues 764–826) were tolerated with only modest effects on FZO1 function (Fig. 1, B and C). However, proline substitutions at positions Tyr-769, Leu-773, and Leu-819 in HR2 caused a complete loss of function and resulted in no growth on glycerol plates and mitochondrial fragmentation (Fig. 1, B and C). Thus, like Mfn1 HR2, Fzo1p HR2 is essential for mitochondrial fusion. HRN (residues 91–190) is also required for FZO1 function. Initial experiments showed that N-terminal truncations that spared HRN had little effect on FZO1 activity, whereas truncations that deleted portions of HRN behaved as null alleles. 3E. Griffin and D. Chan, unpublished results. In addition, fzo1(L98P) had only slight loss of function, whereas fzo1(V172P) behaved as a null allele (Fig. 1, B and C). Taken together, these results indicate that like HR1 and HR2, HRN is essential for Fzo1p activity. We made several further observations in our structure-function analysis. First, consistent with previous reports, mutations in the GTPase domain of FZO1 (fzo1(K200A), fzo1(S201N), and fzo1(T221A)) all caused complete fragmentation of the mitochondrial reticulum (1Hermann G.J. Thatcher J.W. Mills J.P. Hales K.G. Fuller M.T. Nunnari J. Shaw J.M. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 359-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar). Second, in several of the null mutants (including fzo1(V172P), fzo1(T221A), fzo1(Y490P), and fzo1(L518P)) the mitochondrial fragments frequently formed loose aggregates (Fig. 1C). The basis of this aggregation is unclear, but may reflect the trapping of tethered intermediates. Finally, the charged residues present in the bipartite transmembrane domain are not essential for fusion. Fzo1p has three lysines (Lys-727, Lys-735, and Lys-736) in the region of the transmembrane domain thought to form a U-turn in the intermembrane space. The triple mutant fzo1(K727A,K735A,K736A) was highly functional (Fig. 1, B and C). Thus, although the loop residing in the intermembrane space is important for Fzo1p function (23Fritz S. Rapaport D. Klanner E. Neupert W. Westermann B. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 683-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar), its charged nature is not essential. Intragenic Complementation between FZO1 Null Alleles—Mammalian mitofusins have been shown to form higher order complexes (4Chen H. Detmer S.A. Ewald A.J. Griffin E.E. Fraser S.E. Chan D.C. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 160: 189-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (1837) Google Scholar, 26Eura Y. Ishihara N. Yokota S. Mihara K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 2003; 134: 333-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar), and Fzo1p has been shown to be present in a high molecular weight complex in yeast (2Rapaport D. Brunner M. Neupert W. Westermann B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20150-20155Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). In unusual cases, proteins that self-assemble can show intragenic complementation, a genetic phenomenon that results from formation of a functional complex from individually nonfunctional subunits (27Zhang Y. Billington Jr., C.J. Pan D. Neufeld T.P. Genetics. 2006; 172: 355-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). To test whether yeast Fzo1p could exhibit intragenic complementation, we used a plasmid-shuffle strategy to construct fzo1Δ strains co-expressing two null fzo1 alleles. The function of the co-expressed null alleles was evaluated by growth on glycerol plates and mitochondrial morphology. Based on our results above, we used fzo1(V172P), fzo1(L501A, L504A), and fzo1(L819P) as representative null alleles with mutations in HRN, HR1, and HR2, respectively (Fig. 2A). These mutants were tested along with the three GTPase mutants. With these 6 mutants, we constructed 15 pairwise combinations, and intragenic complementation was reproducibly observed in 6 cases (Table 1 and Fig. 2). Co-expression of either of two GTPase mutants with a heptad repeat (HR) mutant restored Fzo1p function. In repeated trials, the GTPase mutants fzo1(K200A) or fzo1(T221A) showed strong complementation with either fzo1(V172P), fzo1(L501A, L504A), or fzo1(L819P), resulting in tubular mitochondrial morphology that corresponded with a restored ability to grow on glycerol plates (Fig. 2, B and C). Thus, Fzo1p activity can occur when the function of the GTPase and heptad repeat regions reside on different Fzo1p molecules. These complementation data also indicate that the null mutations do not have global effects on Fzo1p structure.TABLE 1Summary of intragenic complementation data presented in Fig. 2K200AS201NT221AV172PL501A,504AL819PK200A--+++S201N-----T221A--+++V172P+-+--L501A,504A+-+--L819P+-+-- Open table in a new tab In contrast, many pairs of alleles failed to complement. The GTPase mutant fzo1(S201N) did not complement any of the heptad repeat mutants (see next section). No complementation was observed when an HR1 mutant (fzo1(L501A,L504A)) was co-expressed with an HR2 mutant (fzo1(L819P)) or an HRN mutant (fzo1(V172P)) (Fig. 2, B and C). In addition, when an HRN mutant was co-expressed with an HR2 mutant, FZO1 activity was not restored (Fig. 2, B and C). Finally, co-expression of any two GTPase mutants did not restore mitochondrial fusion. The simplest interpretation of these data is that Fzo1p functions as an oligomer in which GTPase and heptad repeat activity can be donated by different molecules. However, it is also possible that the GTPase and heptad repeat regions act independently (for example, sequentially) at different steps in the fusion pathway. We sought to distinguish these possibilities by testing directly for Fzo1p oligomerization. Fzo1p Functions as an Oligomer—We sought evidence for Fzo1p oligomerization by using a co-immunoprecipitation assay. In these experiments, HA-Fzo1p and Myc-Fzo1p were co-expressed at endogenous levels in fzo1Δ cells. When Myc-Fzo1p was immunoprecipitated, ∼10% of HA-Fzo1p co-immunoprecipitated (Fig. 3, lane 3). Similarly, the mammalian orthologs Mfn1 and Mfn2 have previously been shown to form homotypic and heterotypic complexes (4Chen H. Detmer S.A. Ewald A.J. Griffin E.E. Fraser S.E. Chan D.C. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 160: 189-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (1837) Google Scholar). Taken in conjunction with our intragenic complementation results, these interaction data strongly suggest that Fzo1p functions as an oligomer during mitochondrial fusion. If intragenic complementation is due to oligomerization between mutant Fzo1p molecules, we would expect complementing mutant pairs to co-immunoprecipitate. Indeed, the Fzo1p GTPase mutants fzo1(T221A) and fzo1(K200A) interacted with each of the heptad repeat mutants fzo1(V172P), fzo1(L501A, L504A), and fzo1(L819P) (Fig. 3, lanes 4–6 and 10–12). In contrast, fzo1(S201N) interacted weakly with all the heptad repeat mutants (Fig. 3, lanes 7–9) and was unable to complement (Table 1 and Fig. 2), suggesting efficient oligomerization is necessary for intragenic complementation. Surprisingly, all of our null mutants retained the ability to form homotypic interactions. Mutations in HRN, HR1, HR2, or in both HR1 and HR2 had little effect on Fzo1p self-assembly (Fig. 4, lanes 7–10). More of an effect was seen with the GTPase mutants, most notably S201N, which displayed the lowest levels of interaction (Fig. 4, lanes 4–6). Given that mutations in no single domain completely disrupt Fzo1p interactions, we conclude that oligomerization of Fzo1p likely involves interactions between multiple domains, and that the null phenotypes of the heptad repeat and GTPase mutants are not a result of Fzo1p dissociation. Interaction between Fzo1p-HRN/GTPase and Fzo1p-HR1/HR2—Because several domains likely work in concert to stabilize full-length Fzo1p oligomerization, we attempted to develop a simplified system for examining domain interactions. We tested whether fragments of Fzo1p could physically interact with each other. We analyzed an N-terminal Fzo1p fragment containing HRN and the GTPase domain (Fzo1p-HRN/GTPase, residues 1–415) and a C-terminal fragment that includes HR1, the TM and HR2 (Fzo1p-HR1/HR2, residues 416–855). Fzo1p-HR1/HR2, like full-length Fzo1p, interacted efficiently with full-length Fzo1p (Fig. 5, lanes 3 and 10). A weaker interaction was also seen between two Fzo1p-HR1/HR2 fragments (Fig. 5, lane 11). Most interestingly, the non-overlapping Fzo1p-HRN/GTPase and Fzo1p-HR1/HR2 fragments interacted with each other as efficiently as the full-length Fzo1p-Fzo1p interaction (Fig. 5, lane 12). Thus, Fzo1p-HR1/HR2 has at least two modes of interaction: a homotypic interaction with itself and a heterotypic interaction with Fzo1p-HRN/GTPase. We confirmed the interaction between Fzo1p-HRN/GTPase and Fzo1p-HR1/HR2 by showing that Fzo1p-HR1/HR2 can recruit Fzo1p-HRN/GTPase to mitochondria. Full-length Myc-Fzo1p (n = 200, Fig. 5, B–D) and Fzo1p-HR1/HR2 (data not shown) displayed a uniform mitochondrial localization pattern in all cells. In contrast, Myc-Fzo1p-HRN/GTPase localization was non-mitochondrial and probably cytosolic in all cells (n = 200, Fig. 5, E–G). However, co-expression with the mitochondrial HA-Fzo1p-HR1/HR2 caused redistribution of Myc-Fzo1p-HRN/GTPase to mitochondria in 41% (7% completely mitochondrial, 34.5% mitochondrial and cytosolic) of cells (n = 200, Fig. 5, H–J). These data confirm the physical interaction between Fzo1p-HRN/GTPase and Fzo1p-HR1/HR2 and indicate that this interaction occurs on mitochondria. Having identified an interaction between these two Fzo1p fragments, we tested whether this interaction is functionally important. The null mutations identified previously were tested for their effect on the binding of Fzo1p-HRN/GTPase to Fzo1p-HR1/HR2. When mutations in either HR1 or HR2 were introduced into Fzo1p-HR1/HR2, its interaction with Fzo1p-HRN/GTPase was completely abolished (Fig. 6, lanes 11–13). Similarly, when mutations in HRN or the GTPase domain were introduced into Fzo1p-HRN/GTPase, its interaction with Fzo1p-HR1/HR2 was abolished (Fig. 6, lanes 7–10). Therefore, our null alleles indicate that the interaction of Fzo1p-HRN/GTPase with Fzo1p-HR1/HR2 is essential for fusion. Functional Complementation between Fzo1p-HRN/GTPase and Fzo1p-HR1/HR2—Given their physical interaction on mitochondria, we tested if co-expression of Fzo1p-HRN/GTPase and Fzo1p-HR1/HR2 could restore mitochondrial fusion. When expressed individually, neither fragment supported growth on glycerol or rescued mitochondrial morphology (Fig. 7, A and B). Remarkably, the co-expression of Fzo1p-HRN/GTPase and Fzo1p-HR1/HR2 was sufficient to restore fusion. These cells grew robustly on glycerol plates and displayed largely tubular mitochondria (Fig. 7, A and B). Moreover, cells co-expressing the Fzo1p fragments show significant mitochondrial fusion in the zygotic fusion assay (Table 2) (28Nunnari J. Marshall W.F. Straight A. Murray A. Sedat J.W. Walter P. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 1233-1242Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar). These data indicate that Fzo1p-HRN/GTPase and Fzo1p-HR1/HR2 form a complex competent to support mitochondrial fusion.TABLE 2Strains used in this studyStrains matedMitochondrial fusion%FZO1 dnm1Δ x FZO1 dnm1Δ96fzo1Δ dnm1Δ x fzo1Δ dnm1Δ0fzo1Δ dnm1Δ + pRS414-9XMYC-FZO1 x fzo1Δ dnm1Δ + pRS414-9XMYC-FZO186fzo1Δ dnm1Δ + pRS414-9XMYC-FZO1(HRN/GTPase) + pRS416-6XHA-FZO1(HR1/HR2) x fzo1Δ dnm1Δ + pRS414-9XMYC-FZO1(HRN/GTPase) + pRS416-6XHA-FZO1(HR1/HR2)38.5 Open table in a new tab In this study, we show that Fzo1p functions as an oligomer during mitochondrial fusion. In support of this conclusion, Fzo1p forms homotypic oligomers detectable by co-immunoprecipitation. In addition, specific pairs of fzo1 null alleles are capable of intragenic complementation. Intragenic complementation can occur between pairs of mutants if each mutant affects a different domain of an oligomerized multidomain protein. Within the oligomer, different functional domains are donated from distinct molecules, resulting in the restoration of activity (27Zhang Y. Billington Jr., C.J. Pan D. Neufeld T.P. Genetics. 2006; 172: 355-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). An alternative scenario for intragenic complementation is that the GTPase and heptad repeat domains are not required on the same molecule, because they act at different steps in the fusion reaction. Although we cannot formally exclude this latter explanation, the observation that Fzo1p molecules physically associate strongly favors the former model. Our intragenic complementation data provide insight into the requirements for the activity of different domains on Fzo1p molecules within these oligomers. Within an Fzo1p oligomer, one molecule must possess the activity of all three heptad repeats (for example, a GTPase mutant). A second molecule must possess GTPase activity but not necessarily full heptad repeat activity (for example, an HRN, HR1, or HR2 mutant). Thus co-expression of Fzo1p molecules with heptad repeat activity and Fzo1p molecules with GTPase activity restores fusion, whereas co-expression of two heptad repeat mutants or two GTPase mutants does not restore fusion. Because Fzo1p is required on adjacent mitochondria to support fusion (29Meeusen S. McCaffery J.M. Nunnari J. Science. 2004; 305: 1747-1752Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar), an interesting question that remains to be addressed is whether the intragenic complementation we observe occurs in cis (in a complex formed on one mitochondrion) or in trans (in a complex that spans two mitochondria prior to fusion). In principle, this issue could be determined using an in vitro fusion assay, but unfortunately the available assay does not work for mitochondria isolated from yeast that are incompetent for respiration (29Meeusen S. McCaffery J.M. Nunnari J. Science. 2004; 305: 1747-1752Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar). We have also identified binding of Fzo1p-HRN/GTPase to Fzo1p-HR1/HR2 as an interaction critical for mitochondrial fusion. First, co-expression of Fzo1p-HRN/GTPase and Fzo1p-HR1/HR2 supports mitochondrial fusion. Second, these Fzo1p fragments physically interact with each other. Finally, mutations in the GTPase domain or heptad repeat regions block this interaction and cause complete loss of mitochondrial fusion activity. Future work will help to resolve the complex interactions occurring between Fzo1p molecules. Fzo1p is a large membrane-associated GTPase with some similarities to the dynamin family of mechanochemical membrane-severing enzymes. Dynamins are characterized by their oligomerization-dependent stimulation of GTP hydrolysis. Thus, it will be interesting to test the possibility that intermolecular interactions within an Fzo1p oligomer regulate its GTPase activity. Given that co-expression of a functional GTPase domain on one Fzo1p molecule and functional heptad repeat regions on another molecule is sufficient to support fusion, it is possible that the heptad repeats could play a role in regulating GTPase activity. For example, based on its location near the C terminus, it has been suggested HR2 could function analogously to the GTPase effector domain of dynamin (21Praefcke G.J. McMahon H.T. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 5: 133-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (1129) Google Scholar). In vitro characterization of recombinant Fzo1p fragments can be used to address this possibility. Ultimately, structural information will be required to fully understand the nature of the Fzo1p oligomer. We thank Janet Shaw for stimulating discussions on allelic complementation."

The reconstituted recombinant protein OEP37 from pea forms a rectifying high conductance channel with a main conductance (λ) of Λ= 500 picosiemens (symmetrical 250 mm KCl).

The OEP37 channel displayed a nanomolar affinity for the precursor of the chloroplast inner membrane protein Tic32, which is imported into the chloroplast through a yet unknown pathway.

Thus, OEP37 may constitute a novel peptide-sensitive ion channel in the outer envelope of plastids with function during embryogenesis and germination. The plastid organelle family conducts vital biosynthetic functions in every plant cell. Chloroplasts carry out photosynthesis, which converts atmospheric carbon dioxide to carbohydrates. Furthermore, plastids are the site for fatty acid, amino acid, and porphyrin biosynthesis as well as sulfate and nitrate reduction. Thus, all biosynthetic pathway products are steadily exchanged with the surrounding cell by the assistance of specific transport proteins, localized in the plastid envelope membranes. Although the inner envelope carriers, e.g. the triose phosphatephosphate translocator, the dicarboxylic acid translocator, or the hexose phosphate carrier, show a distinct substrate specificity, until now it remained elusive to what extent transport through outer membrane channels was regulated (for review of plastid envelope transporters compare with Ref. 1Weber A.P.M. Schwacke R. Flügge U.I. Annu. Rev. Plant Biol. 2005; 56: 133-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). The outer envelope membrane has long been assumed to be freely permeable for small molecular mass solutes of up to 10 kDa (2Flügge U.I. Benz R. FEBS Lett. 1984; 169: 85-89Crossref Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Correspondingly, it is believed that the osmotic barrier against the cytosol is formed exclusively by the inner envelope. In Gram-negative bacteria, however, several different types of high conductance channels exist in the outer membrane (3Nikaido H. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2003; 67: 593-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (2800) Google Scholar) as follows. (i) One type is the so-called porins that allow the downhill diffusion of solutes, provided that the size of the solutes does not exceed the exclusion limit (<600 Da), e.g. OmpF. Modulation of some of these channels by ATP and other effectors has been reported, questioning their classification as generally open diffusion pores. (ii) Other porin-like channels include LamB from Escherichia coli, for example, which carries specific sites that facilitate selective diffusion processes. (iii) Specific ligand-gated pores, e.g. E. coli ferric enterobactin channels (FepA), support energy-dependent uptake of iron into bacteria. The ancestral relation between plastids and Gram-negative bacteria therefore suggests the presence of multiple channel proteins in the chloroplast outer membrane. In fact, three specific pore-forming proteins in the outer envelope of pea chloroplasts have already been discovered. They were named according to their location (outer envelope protein) and their molecular weight as OEP16, OEP21, and OEP24 (4Pohlmeyer K. Soll J. Steinkamp T. Hinnah S. Wagner R. Proc. Natl. Acad.

They represent high conductance solute channels with the highest open probability at 0 mV. Their distinct substrate specificities indicate separate roles in different metabolic processes, challenging the notion that they are general diffusion pores. The α-helical OEP16 forms a cation-selective high conductance channel with a remarkable permeability for amino acids and amines (4Pohlmeyer K. Soll J. Steinkamp T. Hinnah S. Wagner R. Proc. Natl.

OEP16 shows similarities to components of the protein translocase of the inner mitochondrial membrane and to a lesser extent to LivH, an amino acid transporter in E. coli (12Rassow J. Dekker P.J. van Wilpe S. Meijer M. Soll J. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 286: 105-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). In contrast, OEP21 has been shown to form an anion channel, which is regulated by ATP and triose phosphates from the intramembrane space (7Bölter B. Soll J. Hill K. Hemmler R. Wagner R.

Here we describe the functional characterization of OEP37, a new member of the β-barrel solute channel proteins in the outer chloroplast membrane. OEP37 forms a rectifying, cation-selective, high conductance channel, which is sensitive to peptides and may function during seed development and germination of Arabidopsis plants. Plant Material and Growth Conditions—All experiments were performed on Arabidopsis thaliana (L.) Heynh. Columbia plants (cv. Col-0; Lehle Seeds, Round Rock, TX). The t-DNA insertion line 722C01 was purchased from GABI-Kat, MPI for Plant Breeding Research, Cologne, Germany. Prior to sowing, seeds were surface-sterilized with ethanol and 5% hypochloride. To synchronize germination, all seeds were kept at 4 °C for 3 days. Plants were grown on soil or on medium containing 1% d-sucrose and 0.5× MS salts (Murashige and Skoog medium), pH 5.7. Plant growth occurred in growth chambers with a 16-h light (21 °C, photon-flux density of 100 μmol m–2 s–1) and 8-h dark cycle (16 °C). Purification of Recombinant OEP37 Proteins—The cDNA of pea OEP37 (19Deeken R. Sanders C. Ache P. Hedrich R. Plant J. 2000; 23: 285-290Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and AtOEP37 (see below) was subcloned via NdeI/BamHI into pET14b (Novagen) and via XhoI/NcoI into pRSET A (Invitrogen) vectors, respectively. Both constructs resulted in N-terminal fusions of the proteins with a polyhistidine (His6) tag. The generated plasmids were used for overexpression after transforming E. coli BL(DE3) cells (Novagen). Rapidly growing cells with a density of E600 = 0.6 were induced with 1 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 3 h at 37 °C. Afterward, pelleted cells were resuspended in cell lysis solution (50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.0, 25% sucrose (w/v), 1 mm EDTA), passed through a French pressure cell, and sonicated (three times for 30 s). Insoluble material was collected by centrifugation at 4 °C and 20,000 × g for 30 min. The resulting inclusion body pellet was first rinsed in detergent buffer I (20 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 0.42% MEGA 9 (w/v)) followed by centrifugation at 4 °C and 4000 × g for 10 min. Subsequently, inclusion bodies were washed two times in buffer II (20 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 0.42% MEGA 9 (w/v)). Finally, the detergent was removed by washing three times in Tris buffer (50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm dithiothreitol). The inclusion bodies were solubilized for 10 min on ice in buffer A (20 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 2 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 8 m urea). The insoluble fraction was pelleted by centrifugation at 4 °C and 20,000 × g for 10 min. The supernatant was loaded onto a TALON metal affinity column (1-ml bed volume, 10 mm inner diameter; Clontech) pre-equilibrated with buffer A. The column was washed with 10 ml of buffer B (20 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.0, 1 m NaCl, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 6 m urea, 10 mm imidazole), and the overexpressed fusion protein was then eluted in 1 ml of buffer E (20 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 6 m urea, 100 mm imidazole). Isolation of AtOEP37 cDNA and Expression Level Profiling—Total RNA from A. thaliana tissues was isolated using the plant RNeasy extraction kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). The cDNA of AtOEP37 was amplified by RT-PCR (Superscript II One-Step RT-PCR system with platinum Taq DNA polymerase; Invitrogen) on 20 ng of RNA, from 4-week-old Arabidopsis leaves. The following gene-specific primers were used: O37araXhoIs (5′-ccgctcgagatggcggatccatcttctca-3′) and O37araNcoIr (5′-catgccatggtcaaatgtcccatcttttc-3′). The resulting PCR product was subcloned by restriction digestion (XhoI/NcoI) into the pRSET A vector (Invitrogen). The open reading frame of AtOEP37 was verified by sequencing. The expression level profiling by Affymetrix gene chip analysis in leaves and roots of 4-week-old Arabidopsis plants was performed as described previously (17Clausen C. Ilkavets I. Thomson R. Philippar K. Vojta A. Möhlmann T. Neuhaus E. Fulgosi H. Soll J. Planta. 2004; 220: 30-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Data used to create digital Northern blots were obtained from the AtGenExpress experiments “effect of abscisic acid during seed imbibition.” “expression profiling of early germinating seeds,” and “developmental series (siliques and seeds)” at the NASCArrays website. For promoter-GUS analysis, a 1499-bp region upstream of the designated start codon of AtOEP37 was PCR-amplified on genomic DNA by the gene-specific primers 37GUSgate_fw (5′-tagtggacaagattaagac-3′) and 37GUSgate_rev (5′-tggaattggatttgaga gaata-3′). The resulting product was subcloned into the binary pKGWFS7 vector (18Karimi M. Inze D. Depicker A. Trends Plant Sci. 2002; 7: 193-195Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2685) Google Scholar) using the GATEWAY cloning system (Invitrogen). Plasmids were transformed into chemically competent Agrobacterium tumefaciens cells, strain GV 3103. Transformation of Arabidopsis plants, selection of positive transformants, and histochemical GUS analysis were performed as described previously (19Deeken R. Sanders C. Ache P. Hedrich R. Plant J. 2000; 23: 285-290Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Antiserum Production and Western Blot Analysis of atOEP37—An antiserum against the purified recombinant atOEP37 protein was raised in rabbit (Pineda Antibody Service, Berlin, Germany). Intact mitochondria and chloroplasts were isolated from leaf material of 3-week-old Arabidopsis plants according to Refs. 20Sweetlove L.J. Heazlewood J.L. Herald V. Holtzapffel R. Day D.A.

The antisera were used in a 1:1000 dilution, and blots were stained using the alkaline phosphatase reaction in the presence of nitro blue tetrazolium and 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate as substrate. Characterization of the t-DNA Mutant oep37-1—Genomic DNA of the T2 and T3 progeny of the heterozygous t-DNA insertion line 722C01 (GABI-Kat (22Rosso M.G. Li Y. Strizhov N. Reiss B. Dekker K. Weisshaar B. Plant Mol. Biol. 2003; 53: 247-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (600) Google Scholar)) was PCR-screened using the AtOEP37 gene-specific primer O37-GABI722_rev (5′-gacgtttgaggatcccattaacagataaagttc-3′) in antisense orientation in combination with the t-DNA-specific left border primer GABI-8409 (5′-atattgaccatcatactcattgc-3′). Both primers generated a 372-bp DNA fragment on hetero- and homozygous plants. By sequencing this PCR product, we identified the t-DNA insertion at position 925 in the AtOEP37 gene. To identify plants with the t-DNA insertion in both alleles of AtOEP37, we used the gene-specific sense primer O37-GABI722_fw (5′-ggatttcggttgtatgctagtgattatgttgg-3′) in combination with O37-GABI722_rev. DNA from homozygous oep37-1 plants gave no amplification product, whereas the amplified region on wild-type and heterozygous DNA was 412 bp long. In all plants tested (n = 35), the oep37-1 mutant allele segregated in a Mendelian fashion (26% homozygous, 63% heterozygous, and 11% wild-type). To monitor transcript abundance in oep37-1 mutant lines, total RNA was extracted from leaves of 4-week-old plants, DNase-digested, and reverse-transcribed into cDNA as described previously (17Clausen C. Ilkavets I. Thomson R. Philippar K. Vojta A. Möhlmann T. Neuhaus E. Fulgosi H. Soll J. Planta. 2004; 220: 30-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Detection of transcripts by real time RT-PCR was performed as depicted before (23Philippar K. Ivashikina N. Ache P. Christian M. Luthen H. Palme K. Hedrich R. Plant J. 2004; 37: 815-827Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), using a LightCycler (Roche Applied Science). For AtOEP37 we constructed the following gene-specific primers: OEP37 LCnt_fw (5′-gcgagatttcacagcc-3′) and OEP37 LCnt_rev (5′-gagcggtacaaacacca-3′). The primer pair was designed to amplify a product of 366 bp, spanning the site of t-DNA insertion in oep37-1. To prevent amplification of contaminating genomic DNA, the primers were selected to flank intron regions (compare Fig. 7A). Protein Import Experiments—Intact chloroplasts for import experiments were isolated from 8-day-old seedlings of wild-type and oep37-1 according to Ref. 21Aronsson H. Jarvis P. FEBS Lett. 2002; 529: 215-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar. In vitro transcription, translation, and protein import of the precursor protein Tic32 (IEP32) from pea was performed as described previously (24Nada A. Soll J. J. Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 3975-3982Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). The standard import reaction contained Arabidopsis chloroplasts equivalent to 10 μg of chlorophyll in 100 μl of import buffer and 3% in vitro translation product. Reconstitution with Mega 9—Small unilamellar liposomes were obtained from purified azolectin (type IV-S, Sigma) as described previously (11Hinnah S.C. Hill K. Wagner R. Schlicher T. Soll J. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 7351-7360Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar), and Mega9 was added to a concentration of 80 mm. Purified OEP37 at a concentration of 0.5–1.2 mg/ml in 6 m urea, 10 mm Tris/HCl, pH 6.9, was also supplemented with Mega9 up to a final concentration of 80 mm. Both solutions were mixed, adjusting the lipid to protein ratio to 0.5–0.8 mg of protein/10 mg of lipid. The mixture was then dialyzed overnight against 5 liters of 10 mm Mops/Tris, pH 7.0, as described previously (25Hill K. Model K. Ryan M.T. Dietmeier K. Martin F. Wagner R. Pfanner N. Nature. 1998; 395: 516-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar). Planar Lipid Bilayers—Planar lipid bilayers were produced by the painting technique (26Müller P. Rudin D. Tien R. Westcott W.C. J. Phys. Chem. 1963; 67: 534-535Crossref Scopus (387) Google Scholar). A solution of 80 mg/ml purified azolectin (type IV-S, Sigma) in n-decan (analytical grade; Merck) was applied to a hole (50–100 μm diameter) in a Teflon septum, separating two bath chambers (volume 3 ml each). Both chambers were equipped with magnetic stirrers. By continuously lowering and then re-raising of the solution level, the lipid layer across the hole was gradually thinned out until a bilayer was formed. This formation was monitored optically and by capacitance measurements. The resulting bilayers had a typical capacitance of 0.5 microfarad/cm2 and a resistance of >100 gigohms. The noise was 3 pA (root mean square) at 5-kHz bandwidth. After the formation of a stable bilayer in 20 mm KCl, 10 mm Mops/Tris, pH 7.0 (in both chambers = symmetrical conditions), the solutions were changed by perfusion to asymmetrical conditions 250/20 mm KCl, 10 mm Mops/Tris, pH 7.0, cis/trans. An osmotic gradient of a channelpermeant solute and a channel in the open state (27Woodbury D.J. Hall J.E. Biophys. J. 1988; 54: 1053-1063Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) are prerequisites for fusion of proteoliposomes with the bilayer (28Blumenthal A. Kahn K. Beja O. Galun E. Colombini M. Breiman A. Plant Physiol. 1993; 101: 579-587Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Proteoliposomes were then added to the cis chamber directly below the bilayer to cause a slow flow of proteoliposomes along the bilayer surface. After fusion the electrolytes were changed to the final composition. We observed asymmetric response (rectification) of the OEP37 channel incorporated into the planar bilayer providing single fusion of a single OP37 channel occurred. However, the orientation of the channel was randomly distributed. The Ag/AgCl electrodes were connected to the chambers through 2 m KCl-agar bridges. The electrode of the trans-compartment was directly connected to the head stage of a current amplifier (Axon Gene Clamp 500B, Axon Instruments, Foster City, CA). Reported membrane potentials are always referred to as the trans compartment. The amplified currents were digitized at a sampling interval of 0.2 ms and fed into a Digidata1302 A/D converter (Axon Instruments) for storage on a personal computer. For analysis, a Windows™-based analysis software (single channel investigation program) developed in our laboratory was used in combination with Origin 7.0 (Microcal Software Inc.). Calculation of the Pore Size—We employed the PEG method in order to determine the pore size of the OEP37 channel (29Sabirov R.Z. Krasilnikov O.V. Ternovsky V.I. Merzliak P.G. Gen. Physiol. Biophys. 1993; 12: 95-111PubMed Google Scholar, 30Krasilnikov O.V. Sabirov R.Z. Ternovsky V.I. Merzliak P.G. Muratkhodjaev J.N. FEMS Microbiol.

The effect of the presence of 20% polyethylene glycol (PEG) of different molecular weights on the channel conductance was measured. PEG particles are sphere-like, neutral polymers, and their hydrodynamic radii are given in Ref. 32Hinnah S.C. Wagner R. Sveshnikova N. Harrer R. Soll J. Biophys. J. 2002; 83: 899-911Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar. The principle of the measurement is as follows. The electric conductivity of the bulk solution is lowered in the presence of PEG. At a low hydrodynamic radius, PEG can enter the channel and lower the conductance of the channel by the same factor as the bulk conductivity, but as their radius increases the particles are progressively excluded from the channel interior, and the conductance begins to recover. The conductance ratio ΛPEG/ΛnoPEG is plotted against the hydrodynamic radius of PEG, and the data are fitted with the logistic dose-response Equation 1, y=A1−A21+(x/x0)p+A2(Eq. 1) where A1 and A2 denote the stationary levels of the sigmoidal developing level; x0 corresponds to the inflection point, and p is an exponential fitting parameter. The minimum and the maximum of the second derivative of the fit are assumed to give the characteristic radius of the pore for the restriction zone and the vestibule, respectively (32Hinnah S.C. Wagner R. Sveshnikova N. Harrer R. Soll J. Biophys. J. 2002; 83: 899-911Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). OEP37 Forms a Rectifying Cation-selective Channel with Subconductant States—The recombinant OEP37 protein from pea was purified to homogeneity (Fig. 1A) and reconstituted into liposomes as described in detail previously (32Hinnah S.C. Wagner R. Sveshnikova N. Harrer R. Soll J. Biophys. J. 2002; 83: 899-911Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). After fusion of OEP37 liposomes with planar lipid bilayers, voltage-dependent single channel currents could be well resolved. Single channel activity was observed at both positive and negative membrane potentials (Fig. 1B). The OEP37 channel displayed complex gating with multiple open channel amplitudes. Two main (chord) conductance levels with conductances of Λm1 = 500 pS, Λm2 = 315 pS, and two less frequent open states with Λs1 = 125 pS and Λs2 = 75 pS were detected (pH 7, 250 mm KCl symmetrical; see Fig. 1C). The conductance of OEP37 was pH-dependent decreasing with decreasing pH values (compare Fig. 1, C and D). Moreover, in bilayers containing only a single active OEP37 channel, a rectifying current voltage relation as shown in Fig. 1E was observed. The rectification ratio at pH 7, 250 mm KCl, symmetrical, was Λm1/Λm2 = 1.6 referring to the main conductance states. Decreasing salt conditions to 20 mm or changing to pH 6 did not affect this ratio. In differently concentrated electrolytes the conductance of the OEP37 channel exhibits saturation with Λ1max = 6.7 nS, K1M = 2.3 m, and Λ2max = 2.5 nS, K2M = 1.2 m for both main conductance states, respectively (Fig. 1F). In asymmetric 250/20 mm KCl solutions at pH 7, the OEP37 channel revealed a reversal potential (Vrev) = +49 mV (Fig. 2A). By using the constant field Goldmann-Hodgkin-Katz approach, this corresponds to a selectivity of PK+/PK– = 14:1. Lowering the pH to a value of pH 6 decreases the reversal potential by roughly 5 mV (Fig. 2B), which corresponds to a reduction of the cation selectivity to PK+/PK– = 10:1. The selectivity of the OEP37 channel was strongly dependent on the ionic strength of the medium. This is documented in Fig. 2C, where reversal potential is shown at a constant cis/trans concentration gradient of 5 but in dependence of different absolute concentrations. The cation selectivity, which is expressed by the permeability ratio of the Goldmann-Hodgkin-Katz approach, increases about 5-fold when decreasing the absolute concentration by a factor of 10. Our results revealed that for the OEP37 channel the permeation properties (conductance and selectivity) of physiologically not relevant Na+ ions were in the same order of magnitude as those for K+ ions (details not shown). To determine the nature of selectivity for physiologically relevant cations like K+, Mg2+, and Ca2+, they were compared in reference to Cl–, respectively. The relative permeabilities of the OEP37 channel for these ions can be summarized to PK+ ≫ PCa2+ ≅ PMg2+ ≅ PK– = 14:0.9:0.8:1 (see Table 1).TABLE 1Selectivity of the OEP37 channelElectrolyteGradientErevP(+):P(-)mmmVKCl250:20+48.5±4.714:1CaCl2125:10-1.9±7.60.9:1MgCl2125:10-3.2±6.00.8:1 Open table in a new tab The open probability (Popen) of the OEP37 channel was determined at different pH values. A representative measurement (pH 7) is shown in Fig. 2D. Popen reveals a voltage dependence typically observed for porins, being maximal at Vmem = 0 mV and decreasing with increasing voltage. The OEP37 Channel Reveals an Hourglass-shaped Topology and Is Reversibly Blocked by Cu2+—The pore dimensions of the OEP37 channel were estimated using the polymer exclusion method (33Vodyanoy I. Bezrukov S.M. Biophys. J. 1992; 62: 10-11Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The pore size was independently determined for the high and low conductance side of the channel using the conductance of the fully open state (main conductance). Fig. 3A shows an example of measurements for the high conductance side, and the inset shows the determination of the pore diameter for the low conductance side (Λm2). A summary of the results is given"
https://openalex.org/W1963917155,"Coenzyme Q (ubiquinone or Q) functions in the respiratory electron transport chain and serves as a lipophilic antioxidant. In the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Q biosynthesis requires nine Coq proteins (Coq1-Coq9). Previous work suggests both an enzymatic activity and a structural role for the yeast Coq7 protein. To define the functional roles of yeast Coq7p we test whether Escherichia coli ubiF can functionally substitute for yeast COQ7. The ubiF gene encodes a flavin-dependent monooxygenase that shares no homology to the Coq7 protein and is required for the final monooxygenase step of Q biosynthesis in E. coli. The ubiF gene expressed at low copy restores growth of a coq7 point mutant (E194K) on medium containing a non-fermentable carbon source, but fails to rescue a coq7 null mutant. However, expression of ubiF from a multicopy vector restores growth and Q synthesis for both mutants, although with a higher efficiency in the point mutant. We attribute the more efficient rescue of the coq7 point mutant to higher steady state levels of the Coq3, Coq4, and Coq6 proteins and to the presence of demethoxyubiquinone, the substrate of UbiF. Coq7p co-migrates with the Coq3 and Coq4 polypeptides as a high molecular mass complex. Here we show that addition of Q to the growth media also stabilizes the Coq3 and Coq4 polypeptides in the coq7 null mutant. The data suggest that Coq7p, and the lipid quinones (demethoxyubiquinone and Q) function to stabilize other Coq polypeptides."

In this study, we show that kainate can enhance the assembly of the GluR6-PSD95-MLK3 module and facilitate the phosphorylation of JNK in rat hippocampal CA1 and CA3/dentate gyrus (DG) subfields. More important, a peptide containing the Tat protein transduction sequence (Tat-GluR6-9c) perturbed the assembly of the GluR6-PSD95-MLK3 signaling module and suppressed the activation of MLK3, MKK7, and JNK. As a result, the inhibition of JNK activation by Tat-GluR6-9c diminished the phosphorylation of the transcription factor c-Jun and down-regulated Fas ligand expression in hippocampal CA1 and CA3/DG regions. The inhibition of JNK activation by Tat-Glur6-9c attenuated Bax translocation, the release of cytochrome c, and the activation of caspase-3 in CA1 and CA3/DG subfields. Furthermore, kainate-induced neuronal loss in hippocampal CA1 and CA3 subregions was prevented by intracerebroventricular injection of Tat-Glur6 - 9c. Taken together, our findings strongly suggest that the GluR6-PSD95-MLK3 signaling module mediates activation of the nuclear and non-nuclear pathways of JNK, which is involved in brain injury induced by kainate.

As the major excitatory neurotransmitter in the central nervous system, glutamate gates three types of ionotropic receptors: N-methyl-d-aspartate, α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionate, and kainate receptors. Kainate receptors are composed of five subunits, glutamate receptor (GluR) 2The abbreviations used are: GluR, glutamate receptor; KA, kainic acid; MLK, mixed-lineage kinase; JNK, c-Jun N-terminal protein kinase; FasL, Fas ligand; DG, dentate gyrus; MOPS, 3-(N-morpholino)propanesulfonic acid; TUNEL, terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling; MKK, mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase. 5, GluR6, GluR7, KA1, and KA2 (1Hollmann M. Heinemann S. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1994; 17: 31-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (3662) Google Scholar). Kainic acid (KA) is a potent exogenous agonist of kainate receptors and α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionate receptors, and systemic administration of KA produces epilepsy in rats and mice accompanied by neuronal damage mainly in limbic structures. In particular, hippocampal pyramidal neurons are highly vulnerable to the excitotoxicity of kainate (2Sperk G. Lassmann H. Baran H. Kish S.J. Seitelberger F. Hornykiewicz O. Neuroscience. 1983; 10: 1301-1315Crossref PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar). Kainate-induced seizures in rodents have been widely used as a model of human temporal lobe epilepsy on the basis of both behavioral and pathological similarities (3Ben-Ari Y. Neuroscience. 1985; 14: 375-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (1536) Google Scholar). Although the expression of a number of cell death regulatory genes and receptors has been investigated in the seizure model, the exact molecular regulation mechanisms of this process remain poorly understood. Recent studies have indicated that GluR6 subunit-deficient and Jnk3 gene knock-out mice share similar phenotypes, including resistance to KA-induced seizures and neuronal toxicity (4Yang D.D.

Additional studies have indicated that the RLPGKETMA motif of the C terminus of GluR6 can bind to the PDZ1 domain of the postsynaptic density protein PSD95/SAP90 through specific interaction (6Garcia E.P.

Previous studies have also shown that MLK3, an upstream kinase of JNK (8Tibbles L.A. Ing Y.L. Kiefer F. Chan J. Iscove N. Woodgett J.R. Lassam N.J. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 7026-7035Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar), can interact with the SH3 (Src homology) domain of PSD95 (9Savinainen A. Garcia E.P. Dorow D. Marshall J. Liu Y.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 11382-11386Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Thus, the triple complex GluR6-PSD95-MLK3 may exist, which can facilitate JNK activation. However, whether signaling module-mediated JNK activation exists in epileptic rat hippocampal CA1and CA3 regions is still unknown. Our previous study on neuronal cell death induced by global ischemia focused on two different possible pathways (10Guan Q.-H. Pei D.-S. Zhang Q.-G. Hao Z.-B. Xu T.-L. Zhang G.-Y. Brain Res. 2005; 1035: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). We showed that activated JNK translocates into the nucleus and phosphorylates transcription factor c-Jun, leading to increased AP-1 transcription activity and cell apoptosis. The activation of JNK may enhance the expression of the Fas ligand (FasL) via c-Jun/AP-1-mediated transcriptional regulation, which could ultimately contribute to Fas receptor-mediated apoptosis. On the other hand, partially activated JNK remains in the cytosol and regulates the activation of non-nuclear substrates, including Bcl-2 family members such as the pro-apoptotic proteins Bax and Bid, and promotes ischemic cell death by inducing the release of cytochrome c (11Cao G.

Studies have shown that seizures induce a mixed pattern of death that includes features consistent with both apoptosis and necrosis (13Pollard H. Charriaut-Marlangue C. Cantagrel S. Represa A.

However, it is still unclear whether KA-induced neuronal death is mediated by the GluR6-PSD95-MLK3 signaling module via nuclear and non-nuclear pathways, which occurs during ischemic injury. In a previous study (19Pei D.-S. Wang X.-T. Liu Y. Sun Y.-F. Guan Q.-H. Wang W. Yan J.-Z. Zong Y.-Y. Xu T.-L. Zhang G.-Y. Brain. 2006; 129: 465-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), we demonstrated that Tat-GluR6-9c, a GluR6 C terminus-containing peptide conjugated to the cell membrane transduction sequence of the human immunodeficiency virus Tat protein, can be delivered into hippocampal neurons in vitro and in vivo. In the present study, we demonstrate that Tat-GluR6-9c can perturb the interaction of GluR6 with PSD95 and suppress the assembly of the GluR6-PSD95-MLK3 signaling module. Furthermore, Tat-GluR6-9c decreases neuronal death induced by kainate in hippocampal CA1 and CA3 subregions via the nuclear and non-nuclear pathways of JNK.

Neurophysiol. 1972; 32: 281-294Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5762) Google Scholar): 1) behavioral arrest and staring spells, 2) head bobbing and gnawing, 3) unilateral forelimb clonus, 4) bilateral forelimb clonus, 5) severe seizures with loss of postural control, and 6) seizure-induced death. Only animals with Stage 4 or 5 seizure were used for this study. Controls were injected with sterile saline. Administration of Drugs—Tat-GluR6-9c (100 μg) or Tat-GluR6AA (control) peptide in 10 μl of saline was administrated to the rats 40 min before KA injection through intracerebroventricular infusion (anteroposterior, 0.8 mm; lateral, 1.5 mm; and depth, 3.5 mm from the bregma). Sample Preparation—Rats were decapitated immediately after different times of KA injection, and the hippocampi were then separated into CA1 and CA3/dentate gyrus (DG) regions and quickly frozen in liquid nitrogen. The hippocampi were homogenized in ice-cold homogenization buffer containing 50 mm MOPS (pH 7.4; Sigma), 100 mm KCl, 320 mm sucrose, 50 mm NaF, 0.5 mm MgCl2, 0.2mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm Na3VO4 (Sigma), 20 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 20 mm β-phosphoglycerol, 1 mm p-nitrophenyl phosphate, 1 mm benzamidine, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, and 5 μg/ml pepstatin A. The homogenates were centrifuged at 800 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. Supernatants were collected, and protein concentration was determined by the method of Lowry et al. (21Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Samples were stored at -80 °C and were thawed only once until used. When necessary, the hippocampal CA1 ad CA3/DG regions were immediately isolated to prepare mitochondrial fractions. All procedures were conducted in a cold room. Generally, unfrozen brain tissue was used to prepare mitochondrial fractions because freezing tissue causes release of cytochrome c from mitochondria. The hippocampal CA1 and CA3/DG tissues were homogenized in 1:10 (w/v) ice-cold homogenization buffer. The homogenates were centrifuged at 800 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The pellets were discarded, and supernatants were centrifuged at 17,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C to obtain the cytosolic fraction in the supernatants and the crude mitochondrial fraction in the pellets. The protein concentrations were determined by the method of Lowry et al. (21Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Nuclear Extraction—The homogenates were centrifuged at 800 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. Supernatants (cytosolic fraction) were collected, and protein concentrations were determined. The nuclear pellets were extracted with 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 20% glycerol, 420 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm MgCl2,1mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and enzyme inhibitors for 30 min at 4 °C with constant agitation. After centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C, supernatants (nuclear fraction) were collected, and protein concentrations were determined. Samples were stored at -80 °C and were thawed only once until used. Immunoprecipitation—Tissue homogenates (400 μg of protein) were diluted 4-fold with immunoprecipitation buffer (50 mm HEPES buffer (pH 7.4) containing 10% glycerol, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 mm Na3VO4). Samples were preincubated for 1 h with 20 μl of protein A-Sepharose CL-4B (Amersham Biosciences, Uppsala, Sweden) at 4 °C and centrifuged to remove proteins that had adhered nonspecifically to protein A. The supernatants were incubated with 1-2 μg of primary antibodies for 4 h or overnight at 4 °C. Protein A was added to the tube for another 2-h incubation. Samples were centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 2 min at 4 °C, and the pellets were washed three times with immunoprecipitation buffer. Bound proteins were eluted by boiling at 100 °C for 5 min in SDS-PAGE loading buffer and then isolated by centrifugation. The supernatants were used for immunoblot analysis. Immunoblotting—Proteins were separated on polyacrylamide gels and then electrotransferred to nitrocellulose membrane (Amersham Biosciences, Buckinghamshire, UK). After blocking for 3 h in Tris-buffered saline with 0.1% Tween 20 (TBST) and 3% bovine serum albumin, membranes were incubated overnight at 4 °C with primary antibodies in TBST containing 3% bovine serum albumin. Membranes were then washed and incubated with alkaline phosphatase-conjugated secondary antibodies in TBST for 2 h and developed using nitro blue tetrazolium/5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate color substrate (Promega Corp.). The density of the bands on the membrane was scanned and analyzed with LabWorks image analysis software (UVP, Inc.). Histological Analysis and Immunohistochemistry—Rats were perfusion-fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 m sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) under anesthesia after 7 days of KA injection. Brains were removed quickly and further fixed with the same fixation solution overnight at 4 °C. Post-fixed brains were embedded in paraffin, followed by preparation of coronal sections (5 μm thick) using a microtome. The paraffin-embedded brain sections were deparaffinized with xylene and rehydrated with ethanol at graded concentrations of 100-70% (v/v), followed by washing with water. The sections were stained with 0.1% (w/v) cresyl violet and examined by light microscopy, and the number of surviving hippocampal CA1 and CA3 pyramidal cells/1 mm of length was counted as the neuronal density. Immunoreactivity was determined by the avidin/biotin/peroxidase method. Briefly, sections were deparaffinized with xylene and rehydrated with ethanol at graded concentrations and distilled water. High temperature antigen retrieval was performed in 1 mm citrate buffer. To block endogenous peroxidase activity, sections were incubated for 30 minin1%H2O2. After being blocked with 5% (v/v) normal goat serum in phosphate-buffered saline for1hat37 °C, sections were incubated with rabbit polyclonal anti-phospho-c-Jun antibody (1:50 dilution) at 4 °C for 2 day. These sections were then incubated overnight with biotinylated goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody and subsequently with avidin-conjugated horseradish peroxidase for 1 h at 37°C. Finally, sections were incubated with the peroxidase substrate diaminobenzidine until the desired stain intensity developed. TUNEL staining was performed using the ApopTag® peroxidase in situ apoptosis detection kit according to the manufacturer's protocol with minor modifications. The paraffin-embedded coronal sections were deparaffinized and rehydrated and then treated with protease K (20 μg/ml) for 15 min at room temperature. Sections were incubated with reaction buffer containing terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase at 37 °C for 1 h. After washing with stop/wash buffer, sections were treated with anti-digoxigenin conjugate for 30 min at room temperature and subsequently developed color in peroxidase substrate. The nuclei were lightly counterstained with 0.5% methyl green. Data Analysis and Statistics—Values are expressed as the means ± S.D. and were obtained from at least six independent rats. Statistical analysis of the results was carried out by Student's t test or one-way analysis of variance, followed by Duncan's new multiple range method or the Newman-Keuls test. p values <0.05 were considered significant. Assembly of the GluR6-PSD95-MLK3 Signaling Module during Seizure Induced by Kainate in Hippocampal CA1 and CA3/DG Regions—To investigate the alternation of the assembly of the GluR6-PSD95-MLK3 signaling module during seizure, rats were injected with KA at different times and decapitated immediately at several time points, and then the hippocampi were removed for homogenization. Immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting were performed to examine the interactions of GluR6 and MLK3 with PSD95 at various times of KA injection. As shown in Fig. 1, our results demonstrated that the interactions of GluR6 and MLK3 with PSD95 increased rapidly after KA injection, reached peak levels at 6 h, and then gradually decreased to control levels at 3 days in both CA1 and CA3/DG regions. However, the interactions of GluR6 and MLK3 with PSD95 were not affected by saline. When immunoprecipitated with nonspecific mouse or rabbit IgG, no significant bands corresponding to PSD95, GluR6, or MLK3 were detected (Fig. 1G). The Tat-GluR6-9c Peptide Suppresses the Increased Assembly of the GluR6-PSD95-MLK3 Signaling Module Induced by Kainate in Hippocampal CA1 and CA3/DG Regions—Our results showed that the association of GluR6-PSD95-MLK3 reached its peak level at 6 h after KA injection. To test the effects of administration of the peptide on the assembly of the GluR6-PSD95-MLK3 module, the association of GluR6 and MLK3 with PSD95 was examined by immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting. Reciprocal immunoprecipitation experiments demonstrated that the peptide perturbed the GluR6-PSD95-MLK3 signaling module. As shown in Fig. 2 (A-D), administration of Tat-GluR6-9c 40 min prior to KA injection diminished the increased interactions of GluR6 and MLK3 with PSD95 at 6 h after kainate treatment in CA1 and CA3/DG subregions, whereas the protein levels of GluR6, PSD95, and MLK3 were not altered. Conversely, the same dose of the Tat-GluR6AA control peptide did not affect the increased associations of GluR6 and MLK3 with PSD95. Tat-GluR6-9c Inhibits the Activation of MLK3, MKK7, and JNK Induced by Kainate in Hippocampal CA1 and CA3/DG Regions—A previous study indicated that MLK3, an upstream kinase of JNK, can be activated via GluR6 and PSD95 (9Savinainen A. Garcia E.P. Dorow D. Marshall J. Liu Y.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 11382-11386Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Therefore, we analyzed the effects of the peptides on the activation of MLK3 induced by kainate. Immunoblotting was performed to examine the phosphorylation and expression of MLK3. As shown in Fig. 3 (A and B), KA treatment resulted in a remarkable increase in the phosphorylation of MLK3 in CA1and CA3/DG regions. Pretreatment with Tat-GluR6-9c significantly diminished the increase in the phosphorylation of MLK3, whereas the protein level of MLK3 was unchanged. The same dose of the Tat-GluR6AA control peptide did not affect the increased phosphorylation of MLK3 in both CA1 and CA3/DG regions. We further examined the effects of pretreatment with Tat-GluR6-9c on the activation of the downstream pathway of MLK3. The results of Western blotting revealed that the activation of MKK7 at 6 h after kainate injection was significantly suppressed by application of the Tat-GluR6-9c peptide in CA1 and CA3/DG regions (Fig. 3, C and D). Furthermore, similar results were obtained with JNK (Fig. 3, E and F). Tat-GluR6-9c Inhibits the Phosphorylation of c-Jun and the Expression of FasL Induced by Kainate in Hippocampal CA1 and CA3/DG Regions—To elucidate the downstream mechanisms of JNK, the effects of Tat-GluR6-9c on the activation and expression of c-Jun after KA injection were investigated. As shown in Fig. 4 (A-D), the results of Western blotting showed that the phosphorylation and expression of c-Jun were significantly increased at 6 and 12 h in both CA1 and CA3/DG regions after KA injection, whereas the saline control showed no significant influence. As shown in Fig. 4 (E and F), prior administration of Tat-GluR6-9c significantly diminished the increase in phospho-c-Jun at 6 h after kainate treatment, but the same dose of the control peptide did not have the same effect. The protein levels of c-Jun were not affected by Tat-GluR6-9c or Tat-GluR6AA. Similar results of decreased phospho-c-Jun immunoreactivity were observed via immunohistochemistry (Fig. 4G). In the saline group (Fig. 4G, panels a and b), weak phospho-c-Jun immunoreactivity was detected in the nuclei of hippocampal CA1 and CA3 regions. At 6 h after kainate injection (Fig. 4G, panels c and d), phospho-c-Jun immunoreactivity significantly increased compared with the saline group. There was no inhibitory effect of intracerebroventricular pre-infusion of Tat-GluR6AA on phospho-c-Jun immunoreactivity at 6 h after KA treatment (Fig. 4G, panels e and f). Phospho-c-Jun immunoreactivity was significantly inhibited by pre-infusion of Tat-GluR6-9c (Fig. 4G, panels g and h). Next, to investigate whether the Fas receptor-mediated pathway is involved in the apoptotic profile induced by kainate, the effects of Tat-GluR6-9c on the expression of FasL and Fas were analyzed by Western blotting. As shown in Fig. 5 (A-D), the expression of FasL increased rapidly at 6 h and returned to the basal level at 3 days in CA1 and CA3/DG regions, whereas the expression of Fas showed no significant changes. Prior application of Tat-GluR6-9c diminished the increased expression of FasL at 6 h induced by kainate in hippocampal CA1 and CA3/DG regions (Fig. 5, E and F). The same dose of the control peptide did not affect the increase in the expression of FasL. The protein level of Fas was not affected by Tat-GluR6-9c and the control peptide. Tat-GluR6-9c Decreases Bax Expression and Increases Bcl-2 Expression Induced by Kainate in Hippocampal CA1 and CA3/DG Regions—It is known that Bcl-2 is an anti-apoptotic protein, whereas Bax is an pro-apoptotic protein. We first investigated the Bax/Bcl-2 ratio after KA injection. As shown in Fig. 6 (A and B), the expression of Bax increased dramatically at 6 h after KA injection and lasted 3 days, whereas the level of Bcl-2 decreased sharply at 6 h after KA injection and reached the lowest at 3 days in the CA1 region. Fig. 6 (C and D) shows similar results in the CA3/DG regions, whereas the saline control showed no significant effect on the expression of Bax and Bcl-2. Next, we examined the effects of Tat-GluR6-9c on the levels of Bax and Bcl-2 in hippocampal CA1 and CA3/DG regions. As shown in Fig. 6 (E and F), prior application of Tat-GluR6-9c resulted in the decreased expression of Bax at 6 h after KA treatment in both CA1 and CA3/DG regions, whereas the level of Bcl-2 was obviously increased at 6 h after KA injection. Tat-GluR6-9c Attenuates Bax Translocation and the Release of Cytochrome c Induced by Kainate in Hippocampal CA1 and CA3/DG Regions—A previous study demonstrated mitochondrial Bax accumulation after seizure (22Henshall D.C. Araki T. Schindler C.K. Lan J.Q. Tiekoter K.L. Taki W. Simon R.P. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 8458-8465Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To further elucidate the involvement of the mitochondrion-mediated apoptotic pathway induced by KA, the expression of Bax and cytochrome c in both mitochondria and the corresponding cytosol was examined by Western blotting. We first demonstrated that the inhibitory effect of Tat-GluR6-9c on Bax translocation in the mitochondrial fraction reached a statistical difference at 6 h after KA administration compared with that of the Tat-GluR6AA control peptide in both CA1 and CA3/DG regions (Fig. 7, A and B). In the cytosolic fraction, cytochrome c immunoreactivity was evident as a single band of 15 kDa at 6 h of KA injection. However, it was barely detected in the saline group (Fig. 7, C and D). A significant amount of mitochondrial cytochrome c was detected in the saline group, and it decreased at 6 h after KA injection corresponding to a marked increase in the cytosolic fraction. Moreover, Tat-GluR6-9c inhibited the release of cytochrome c from mitochondria to the cytosol compared with the 6-h KA groups and Tat-GluR6AA-treated groups (Fig. 7, C and D) in CA1 and CA3/DG fields. To further investigate whether other mitochondrial protein was released from mitochondria, we examined the cytochrome c oxidase levels in the cytosolic and mitochondrial fractions using anti-cytochrome c oxidase subunit IV antibody. Cytochrome c oxidase subunit IV was detected only in the mitochondrial fraction, but not in the cytosolic fraction of the saline group, kainate-treated group, or peptide-treated groups. Tat-GluR6-9c Inhibits the Activation of Caspase-3 and Neuronal Apoptosis Induced by Kainate in Hippocampal CA1 and CA3/DG Regions—In this study, we examined the inhibitory effects of Tat-GluR6-9c on the activation of caspase-3 (p20) at 6 h after KA injection in CA1 and CA3/DG regions. As shown in Fig. 8 (A-C), immunoblot analysis indicated that Tat-GluR6-9c pretreatment diminished the activation of caspase-3 at 6 h after KA injection. The same dose of the control peptide did not affect the increase in the activation of caspase-3. Furthermore, we investigated the role of Tat-GluR6-9c in kainate-induced neuronal apoptosis by TUNEL staining in hippocampal CA1 and CA3 regions. Rats were pretreated with Tat-GluR6-9c or Tat-GluR6AA by cerebroventricular injection 40 min before KA injection. After 7 days, rats were perfusion-fixed with paraformaldehyde. TUNEL staining was used to examine the apoptosis of CA1 and CA3 neuronal cells in the hippocampus. As shown in Fig. 8D, compared with the saline group (panels a and b), significant numbers of TUNEL-positive cells were observed in the KA-treated group (panels c and d) after 7 days, with some of them showing characteristic appearances such as shrunken condensed nuclei and apoptotic bodies. Administration of Tat-GluR6-9c 40 min before KA injection significantly decreased TUNEL-positive cells (panels g and h). However, as a control, Tat-GluR6AA did not show any protective effect (panels e and f). Th"

Little is known regarding the structure-function relationship in this cotransporter. Previous studies from our group reveal that mammalian NCC exhibits higher affinity for ions and thiazides than teleost NCC and suggest a role for glycosylation upon thiazide affinity. Here we have constructed a series of chimeric and mutant cDNAs between rat and flounder NCC to define the role of glycosylation status, the amino-terminal domain, the carboxyl-terminal domain, the extracellular glycosylated loop, and the transmembrane segments upon affinity for Na+, Cl-, and metolazone. Xenopus laevis oocytes were used as the heterologous expression system. We observed that elimination of glycosylation sites in flounder NCC did not affect the affinity of the cotransporter for metolazone. Also, swapping the amino-terminal domain, the carboxyl-terminal domain, the glycosylation sites, or the entire extracellular glycosylation loop between rat and flounder NCC had no effect upon ions or metolazone affinity. In contrast, interchanging transmembrane regions between rat and flounder NCC revealed that affinity-modifying residues for chloride are located within the transmembrane 1-7 region and for thiazides are located within the transmembrane 8-12 region, whereas both segments seem to be implicated in defining sodium affinity. These observations strongly suggest that binding sites for chloride and thiazide in NCC are different."
https://openalex.org/W2125871373,"The microtubule-dependent motor protein Eg5 plays a critical role in spindle assembly and maintenance in mitosis. Herein we show that the suppression of Eg5 by a specific inhibitor arrested mitosis, induced apoptosis, and up-regulated Hsp70 in human multiple myeloma cells. Mechanistically, Hsp70 induction occurred at the transcriptional level via a cis-regulatory DNA element in Hsp70 promoter and was mediated by the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt pathway. Eg5 inhibitor-mediated Hsp70 up-regulation is cytoprotective because blocking Hsp70 induction directly by antisense or small interfering RNA or indirectly by inhibiting the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt pathway significantly increased Eg5 inhibitor-induced apoptosis. Furthermore, a farnesyltransferase inhibitor interacted synergistically with the Eg5 inhibitor in inducing apoptosis through disrupting the Akt/Hsp70 signaling axis. These findings provide the first evidence for Eg5 inhibitor activity in hematologic malignancy and identify Hsp70 up-regulation as a critical mechanism responsible for modulating myeloma cell sensitivity to Eg5 inhibitors. In addition, these findings suggest that a combination of Eg5 inhibitors with agents abrogating Hsp70 induction would be useful for myeloma therapy in the clinic.

The mitotic spindle, composed of microtubules and their associated proteins, is the major machinery that orchestrates chromosome segregation during mitosis (1Zhou J. Yao J. Joshi H.C. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 3547-3555Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Chemical agents that interfere with the mitotic spindle, such as taxanes and vinca alkaloids, have proven effective clinically in the treatment of human malignancies (2Checchi P.M. Nettles J.H. Zhou J. Snyder J.P. Joshi H.C. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2003; 24: 361-365Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 3Jordan M.A. Wilson L. Nat. Rev.

These chemotherapeutic agents target tubulin and alter microtubule dynamics. As a result, they impair the assembly and function of the mitotic spindle and cause cell cycle arrest in mitosis, ultimately leading to apoptosis (3Jordan M.A. Wilson L. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2004; 4: 253-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (3557) Google Scholar, 4Zhou J. Giannakakou P. Curr. Med. Chem. Anticancer Agents. 2005; 5: 65-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar). However, because microtubules are involved in many other cellular processes such as cell shaping, cell motility, and intracellular transport, use of microtubule inhibitors in cancer therapy is often associated with mechanism-based toxicities to normal tissues, notably neurotoxicity (4Zhou J. Giannakakou P. Curr. Med. Chem. Anticancer Agents. 2005; 5: 65-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar, 5Rowinsky E.K. Annu. Rev.

Consequently, it is necessary to search for agents that target spindle components other than tubulin and display reduced side effects and better pharmacological profiles. Inhibitors of Eg5 (also named kinesin spindle protein or kinesin-5) have emerged as a new class of agents that interfere with the mitotic spindle (7Duhl D.M. Renhowe P.A. Curr. Opin. Drug Discovery Dev. 2005; 8: 431-436PubMed Google Scholar). Eg5 is a microtubule-dependent motor protein of the kinesin family that is crucial in mitosis for spindle assembly and maintenance (8Blangy A. Lane H.A. d'Herin P. Harper M. Kress M. Nigg E.A.

The first small-molecule inhibitor of Eg5, monastrol, was discovered in a phenotype-based screening and so named because it gave rise to cells with monopolar spindles (monoasters) (10Mayer T.U. Kapoor T.M. Haggarty S.J. King R.W. Schreiber S.L. Mitchison T.J. Science. 1999; 286: 971-974Crossref PubMed Scopus (1615) Google Scholar). Since then, a number of Eg5 inhibitors have been identified, including HR22C16, CK0106023, EG5-IA, and dimethylenastron (17Hotha S. Yarrow J.C. Yang J.G. Garrett S. Renduchintala K.V. Mayer T.U.

Surrey T. Giannis A. Chembiochem. 2005; 6: 1173-1177Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Dimethylenastron is a member of the quinazoline-2(1H)-thione class and is identified in an in vitro ATPase assay-based screening as a specific, cell-permeable Eg5 inhibitor (20Gartner M. Sunder-Plassmann N. Seiler J. Utz M. Vernos I. Surrey T. Giannis A. Chembiochem. 2005; 6: 1173-1177Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Similar to microtubule inhibitors, Eg5 inhibitors arrest mitosis and trigger apoptosis. Because Eg5 is not expressed in post-mitotic neurons and is likely to act only in dividing cells (18Sakowicz R. Finer J.T. Beraud C. Crompton A. Lewis E. Fritsch A. Lee Y. Mak J. Moody R. Turincio R. Chabala J.C. Gonzales P. Roth S. Weitman S. Wood K.W. Cancer Res. 2004; 64: 3276-3280Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar), its inhibitors might provide better specificity than microtubule inhibitors in the treatment of human malignancies. Eg5 inhibitors have shown impressive anticancer activity in preclinical studies and are currently being investigated in phase I and phase II clinical trials. The Eg5 inhibitor dimethylenastron has shown antiproliferative activity in human cervical carcinoma cells (20Gartner M. Sunder-Plassmann N. Seiler J. Utz M. Vernos I. Surrey T. Giannis A. Chembiochem. 2005; 6: 1173-1177Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). In this study, we examined if and how dimethylenastron exerts a therapeutic function in human multiple myeloma cells. We found that dimethylenastron halted cell cycle progression in mitosis and induced apoptosis. Dimethylenastron activated the PI3K/Akt pathway, which in turn caused a remarkable transcriptional up-regulation of heat shock protein 70 (Hsp70). 2The abbreviations used are: Hsp70, 70,000-Da heat shock protein; PI3K, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase; FTI, farnesyltransferase inhibitor; CI, combination index; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; TK, thymidine kinase; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; JNK, c-Jun amino-terminal kinase; ASK1, apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1; m.o.i., multiplicity of infection; AIF, apoptosis-inducing factor. Dimethylenastron-induced apoptosis was enhanced by blocking Hsp70 induction directly with antisense or small interfering RNA or indirectly by inhibiting the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt pathway with pharmacological or dominant-negative approaches. Furthermore, we found that FTI277, a specific small-molecule inhibitor of farnesyltransferase, synergized with dimethylenastron in inducing apoptosis by interrupting the PI3K/Akt/Hsp70 cascade. These results provide the first evidence for the effectiveness of Eg5 inhibitors in killing human multiple myeloma cells and uncover critical molecular events that regulate myeloma cell sensitivity to Eg5 inhibitors. Materials—Dimethylenastron was prepared as described previously (20Gartner M. Sunder-Plassmann N. Seiler J. Utz M. Vernos I. Surrey T. Giannis A. Chembiochem. 2005; 6: 1173-1177Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar), and LY294002, LY303511, and FTI277 were obtained from Calbiochem. Antibodies againstα-tubulin andβ-actin were from Sigma, antibodies against Hsp70 were from Stressgen, and all the other primary antibodies were from Cell Signaling. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit and anti-mouse secondary antibodies were purchased from Amersham Biosciences, and fluorescein-conjugated anti-mouse secondary antibodies were from Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories. Cells and Viruses—Human multiple myeloma RPMI8226 cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 2 mm l-glutamine and 10% fetal bovine serum at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere with 5% CO2. Adenoviruses encoding Akt, dominant-negative Akt, Hsp70, and antisense Hsp70 and retroviruses encoding Hsp70 small hairpin interfering RNA were prepared and amplified in low passage human embryonic kidney 293 cells as described previously (21Suhara T.

Cytotoxicity Assay—Cells grown in 96-well plates were treated with gradient concentrations of dimethylenastron for 48 h. Sulforhodamine B assay was then performed to evaluate drug cytotoxicity and to determine the drug concentration needed for 50% cell killing (LD50). Analysis of Combined Drug Effects—Cells were treated with a range of dimethylenastron and FTI277 concentrations alone and in combination at a fixed ratio of 1:10 for 48 h. At the end of this period, the extent of cell death was measured by a cytotoxicity assay for each condition. Treatment interaction effects between dimethylenastron and FTI277 were then determined by calculating the combination index (CI) values for each fraction affected using the commercially available CalcuSyn program (Biosoft), which is based on the principle of Chou and Talalay (25Chou T.C. Talalay P. Trends Pharmacol Sci. 1982; 4: 450-454Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (525) Google Scholar). CI values less than 1 correspond to synergistic drug interactions, CI values equal to 1 correspond to additive interactions, and CI values more than 1 correspond to antagonistic interactions. Flow Cytometry—Flow cytometric evaluation of cell cycle status was performed as described previously (26Zhou J. Panda D. Landen J.W. Wilson L. Joshi H.C. J. Biol.

Briefly, 2 × 106 cells were collected, washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and fixed in 70% ethanol for 24 h. Cells were washed again with PBS and incubated with 20μg/ml propidium iodide and 20μg/ml RNase A in PBS for 30 min in dark. Samples were analyzed on a Coulter Elite flow cytometer (Beckman). Annexin V staining assay was performed by using the annexin V apoptosis detection kit (BD Biosciences). Briefly, cells were washed with PBS and then resuspended in binding buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 140 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm CaCl2). Cells were incubated with fluorescein-conjugated annexin V for 15 min in the dark, suspended in binding buffer, and then analyzed on the flow cytometer as described above. Immunofluorescence Microscopy—Cells grown on polylysine/fibronectin-coated glass coverslips were fixed with methanol for 5 min at –20 °C, washed with PBS, and blocked with 2% bovine serum albumin in PBS. Cells were incubated with a mouse monoclonal anti-α-tubulin antibody (Sigma) and then a fluorescein-conjugated secondary antibody followed by staining with propidium iodide for 10 min. Coverslips were mounted with 90% glycerol in PBS and examined with a Zeiss fluorescence microscope. Luciferase Reporter Assay—Cells were transfected with pRL-TK Renilla luciferase reporter plasmid (Promega) and Hsp70 promoter-driven firefly luciferase reporter plasmids (28Ray S. Lu Y. Kaufmann S.H. Gustafson W.C. Karp J.E. Boldogh I. Fields A.P. Brasier A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 35604-35615Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Luciferase activities were then determined by using the dual luciferase reporter assay system according to the manufacturer's protocol (Promega). Western Blot Analysis—Proteins were resolved by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore) as described previously (29Zhou J. Gupta K. Yao J. Ye K. Panda D. Giannakakou P. Joshi H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 39777-39785Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 30Zhou J. Liu M. Aneja R. Chandra R. Lage H. Joshi H.C. Cancer Res. 2006; 66: 445-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). The membranes were blocked in Tris-buffered saline containing 0.2% Tween 20 and 5% fat-free dry milk and incubated first with primary antibodies and then with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies. Specific proteins were visualized with enhanced chemiluminescence detection reagent according to the manufacturer's instructions (Pierce Biotechnology). The intensity of protein bands was determined by densitometry with a Lynx video densitometer (Biological Vision). Eg5 Inhibitor Dimethylenastron Induces Mitotic Arrest and Apoptosis in Human Multiple Myeloma Cells—Using a sulforhodamine B-based cytotoxicity assay, we found that dimethylenastron was highly potent against RPMI8226 human multiple myeloma cells with an LD50 of 0.48 μm (Fig. 1A). Like other known Eg5 inhibitors, dimethylenastron blocked cell cycle progression in mitosis and induced monoastral spindles (Fig. 1, B and C). Prolonged treatment of cells with dimethylenastron induced apoptosis, as revealed by a significant increase in the number of cells with sub-G1 (hypodiploid) DNA content (Fig. 1B), annexin V positive staining (Fig. 1D), and cleavage of caspase-3 and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (Fig. 1E). Dimethylenastron Up-regulates Hsp70 at the Transcriptional Level in Myeloma Cells—Our two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis initiative using extracts from dimethylenastron-treated and untreated RPMI8226 cells identified Hsp70 as a protein up-regulated by dimethylenastron, which was confirmed by Western blot analysis (Fig. 2, A and B). Hsp70 protein level was induced by 12-fold at 6 h of dimethylenastron treatment and by 17-fold at 12 h of treatment. Surprisingly, longer treatment decreased the effect of dimethylenastron on Hsp70 up-regulation (Fig. 2A). We also examined the level of Hsp70 after cells were treated with different dimethylenastron concentrations, and found that dimethylenastron up-regulated Hsp70 in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 2B). There are several reports indicating that Hsp70 can be induced by heat shock and mitogenic agents primarily at the transcriptional level (31Morgan W.D. Williams G.T. Morimoto R.I. Greene J. Kingston R.E. Tjian R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 1129-1138Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 32Stephanou A. Isenberg D.A. Nakajima K. Latchman D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1723-1728Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). To examine whether dimethylenastron also regulates Hsp70 transcriptionally, we performed a luciferase reporter assay using pHsp70(–259), a luciferase reporter plasmid driven by Hsp70 promoter (28Ray S. Lu Y. Kaufmann S.H. Gustafson W.C. Karp J.E. Boldogh I. Fields A.P. Brasier A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 35604-35615Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Consistent with the results obtained from Western blot analysis, dimethylenastron treatment increased the pHsp70(–259) luciferase activity (Fig. 2C). Interestingly, although Hsp70 protein induction peaked at 12 h of drug treatment (Fig. 2A), maximal induction of pHsp70(–259) luciferase activity occurred at 18 h post-treatment (Fig. 2C). To further characterize the transcriptional regulation of Hsp70 by dimethylenastron, we transfected cells with a series of luciferase reporter plasmids driven by different sizes of Hsp70 promoters, including pHsp70(–259), pHsp70(–200), pHsp70(–163), pHsp70(–123), and pHsp70(–82), which differed in size because of 5′ deletions (28Ray S. Lu Y. Kaufmann S.H. Gustafson W.C. Karp J.E. Boldogh I. Fields A.P. Brasier A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 35604-35615Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Dimethylenastron induced comparable luciferase activities in pHsp70(–259), pHsp70(–200), and pHsp70(–163) but significantly reduced activities in pHsp70(–123) and pHsp70(–82) (Fig. 2D). These results indicate that the sequence between –163 and –123 in the Hsp70 promoter contained the cis-regulatory DNA element that mediates Hsp70 transcriptional up-regulation by dimethylenastron. The PI3K/Akt Pathway Plays a Role in Dimethylenastron-mediated Up-regulation of Hsp70—The PI3K/Akt pathway and the pathways of the mitogen-activated protein kinases, i.e. p38, extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), and c-Jun amino-terminal kinase (JNK), have been implicated in the up-regulation of Hsp70 (33Zhou J. Schmid T. Frank R. Brune B. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 13506-13513Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar, 34Hung J.J. Cheng T.J. Lai Y.K. Chang M.D. J. Biol.

Immunol. 2005; 175: 2622-2629Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). To determine whether these pathways play a role in the up-regulation of Hsp70 by dimethylenastron, the activation of Akt, p38, ERK, and JNK was examined by Western blot analysis using antibodies against phosphorylated (activated) forms of these proteins (Fig. 3A). We found that dimethylenastron rapidly activated Akt with maximal activation at 4 h post-treatment. In contrast, there was no detectable activation of p38, ERK, or JNK (Fig. 3A). Furthermore, dimethylenastron-induced Akt activation was inhibited by LY294002, a potent and specific inhibitor of PI3K, but not by LY303511, an inactive analog of LY294002 (Fig. 3B). More importantly, dimethylenastron-induced Hsp70 up-regulation was largely inhibited by LY294002, but not by LY303511 (Fig. 3B), clearly implicating the PI3K/Akt pathway in dimethylenastron-mediated Hsp70 up-regulation. The role of PI3K/Akt pathway in Hsp70 induction was further investigated by using the luciferase reporter assay. We found that dimethylenastron-mediated Hsp70 promoter activity was significantly attenuated by the PI3K inhibitor (Fig. 3C). In addition, adenovirus-mediated expression of a dominant-negative Akt inhibited dimethylenastron-induced Hsp70 promoter activity in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 3D). Together, these results indicate that the PI3K/Akt pathway plays a role in dimethylenastron-induced Hsp70 up-regulation. Inhibition of Hsp70 Induction Sensitizes Cells to Dimethylenastron-induced Apoptosis—Hsp70 has an anti-apoptotic effect through various mechanisms. For example, Hsp70 can directly bind and antagonize the function of several pro-apoptotic proteins, such as apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF), Apaf-1, and apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1 (ASK1) (39Nylandsted J. Brand K. Jaattela M. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 2000; 926: 122-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar, 40Saleh A. Srinivasula S.M. Balkir L. Robbins P.D. Alnemri E.S. Nat.

Ko Y.G. Kim S. Choi E.J. Mol. Cell Biol. 2002; 22: 7721-7730Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). We investigated whether Hsp70 induction exerts an anti-apoptotic effect in response to dimethylenastron treatment. As shown in Fig. 4A, adenoviruses encoding Hsp70-specific antisense RNA reduced Hsp70 expression in dimethylenastron-treated cells and promoted dimethylenastron-induced apoptosis, whereas control adenoviruses had no obvious effect. Similarly, retroviral expression of small interfering RNA against Hsp70 (Hsp70si) also potently inhibited dimethylenastron-induced Hsp70 up-regulation (Fig. 4B). As expected, knockdown of Hsp70 significantly sensitized cells to dimethylenastron-induced apoptosis (Fig. 4C). We also examined whether inhibition of Hsp70 induction by blocking the PI3K/Akt pathway also enhances dimethylenastron-induced apoptosis. As shown in Fig. 5A, inhibition of Akt phosphorylation by the PI3K inhibitor LY294002 significantly enhanced dimethylenastron-induced apoptosis at a concentration of 25 μm, whereas its effect was only subtle at 1 or 5 μm. The enhancing effect of PI3K/Akt inhibition on dimethylenastron-induced apoptosis was also observed when dominant-negative Akt was used (Fig. 5B). Moreover, the presence of excessive wild-type Akt could prevent the effect of dominant-negative Akt (Fig. 5B). Together, these results suggest that Hsp70 induction plays a cytoprotective role in response to dimethylenastron, and abrogating Hsp70 induction could potentiate dimethylenastron-induced apoptosis either directly or indirectly. FTI277 Induces Apoptosis Synergistically with Dimethylenastron through Disrupting the PI3K/Akt/Hsp70 Cascade—Farnesyltransferase inhibitors (FTIs) represent a new generation of chemotherapeutic drugs currently undergoing clinical evaluation (44Zhu K. Hamilton A.D. Sebti S.M. Curr. Opin. Investig. Drugs. 2003; 4: 1428-1435PubMed Google Scholar). They inhibit the farnesylation of H-Ras, Rheb, RhoB, CENP-E, CENP-F, and several other cellular proteins and thereby interfere with a number of signaling pathways, including the PI3K/Akt pathway (45Du W. Liu A. Prendergast G.C. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 4208-4212PubMed Google Scholar). Because the PI3K/Akt pathway mediates dimethylenastron-induced up-regulation of Hsp70, it is possible that FTIs might sensitize cells to dimethylenastron-induced apoptosis by interrupting the PI3K/Akt/Hsp70 cascade. We examined this possibility by treating cells with varying concentrations of dimethylenastron and FTI277 (a specific FTI) alone and in combination at a fixed ratio of 1:10 for 48 h. At the end of this period, the extent of cell death was measured by a cytotoxicity assay for each condition. Treatment interaction effects between dimethylenastron and FTI277 were then determined by calculating the CI values for each fraction affected using the CalcuSyn program, based on the principle of Chou and Talalay (25Chou T.C. Talalay P. Trends Pharmacol Sci. 1982; 4: 450-454Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (525) Google Scholar). Such analysis yielded CI values less than 1 for the combination of dimethylenastron with FTI277, corresponding to a synergistic interaction between these two drugs (Fig. 6A). Annexin V staining assay further revealed that 10 μm FTI277 did not cause obvious apoptosis but substantially potentiated dimethylenastron-induced apoptosis (Fig. 6B). Western blot analysis showed that FTI277 markedly inhibited dimethylenastron-induced Akt activation and Hsp70 induction (Fig. 6C), suggesting that the synergistic interaction between FTI277 and dimethylenastron is mediated by the Akt/Hsp70 pathway. Our data further showed that inhibition of Hsp70 synthesis by FTI277 decreased long term (72 h) survival of dimethylenastron-treated cells (Fig. 6D). In addition, we found that adenovirus-mediated overexpression of Akt or Hsp70 protected cells from dimethylenastron/FTI277-induced apoptosis, and the level of protection provided by delivery of Akt was accompanied by a similar level of Hsp70 expression as when Hsp70 was delivered (Fig. 6, E and F). These results thus indicate that FTI277 synergizes with dimethylenastron in inducing apoptosis through interfering with the PI3K/Akt/Hsp70 signaling axis. We then examined whether overexpression of Hsp70 in cells not treated with FTI277 could increase the survival of dimethylenastron-treated cells. Short term measures (36 h) of apoptosis revealed that Hsp70 overexpression inhibited dimethylenastron-induced apoptosis (Fig. 6G). Furthermore, long term (72 h) measures of viability revealed that Hsp70 overexpression increased the survival of dimethylenastron-treated cells (Fig. 6H). These results show the relevance of Hsp70 to long term cell survival in dimethylenastron-treated cells. Multiple myeloma, also known as myeloma or plasma cell myeloma, is the second most prevalent hematologic malignancy after non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Chemotherapy is one of the major treatment options to today's myeloma patients. Unfortunately, clinical use of currently available drugs is hampered by various side effects. Thus, there is an urgent need to identify agents with higher specificity and fewer side effects to improve the treatment of this disease. Over the past years, small-molecule inhibitors of the mitotic kinesin Eg5 have demonstrated potential as novel chemotherapeutics. However, their therapeutic value in hematologic cancer has not been examined. In the present study, we show for the first time that dimethylenastron, an Eg5-specific cell-permeable inhibitor, potently inhibited cell proliferation and induced apoptosis in myeloma cells. We also demonstrated that dimethylenastron inhibits myeloma cell proliferation by blocking mitosis, resulting in cells with monopolar spindles. This phenotype is similar to that observed when cells are injected with Eg5 antibodies or treated with other Eg5 inhibitors (8Blangy A. Lane H.A. d'Herin P. Harper M. Kress M. Nigg E.A.

Cells treated with dimethylenastron, similar to those treated with other Eg5 inhibitors and other anti-spindle agents, eventually succumb to apoptosis following mitotic arrest. These results indicate that Eg5 could be a valuable therapeutic target, and dimethylenastron could be useful in the treatment of myeloma. Regarding the mechanism of action of Eg5 inhibitors, previous studies were largely limited to the inhibition of mitotic progression and induction of apoptosis. In the present study, we demonstrated that the Eg5 inhibitor dimethylenastron up-regulated Hsp70 protein in a time- and dose-dependent manner. Hsp70 induction occurred transcriptionally as indicated by an increase in Hsp70 promoter activity. Although Hsp70 promoter activity peaked at 18 h post-dimethylenastron treatment, Hsp70 protein induction peaked at 12 h. Other mechanisms could thus be involved in the regulation of Hsp70 by dimethylenastron. We also found that dimethylenastron activated Akt, but not p38, ERK, or JNK, prior to the induction of Hsp70. In addition, inhibition of the PI3K/Akt pathway significantly blocked Hsp70 induction. These results indicate that the PI3K/Akt pathway is crucial for dimethylenastron-mediated Hsp70 up-regulation. Nevertheless, there was a modest induction of Hsp70 protein and Hsp70 promoter activity even in the presence of high concentrations of PI3K inhibitors or dominant-negative Akt adenoviruses. Therefore, although the PI3K/Akt pathway plays an important role in dimethylenastron-induced Hsp70 expression, other regulatory pathways may also exist. By serial deletion analysis, we have identified a cis-regulatory sequence in Hsp70 promoter, located between nucleotides –163 and –123, as the major region responsible for dimethylenastron-induced Hsp70 up-regulation. This region is upstream to the heat shock element and the binding sites for signal transducers and activators of transcription (32Stephanou A. Isenberg D.A. Nakajima K. Latchman D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1723-1728Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 47Madamanchi N.R. Li S. Patterson C. Runge M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 18915-18924Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). A Web-based navigation through transcription factor binding data bases, using the dimethylenastron response sequence as bait, does not provide instructive information as to which known transcription factor(s) might be involved in the up-regulation of Hsp70 by the Eg5 inhibitor. Hsp70 up-regulation is known to occur as part of the cellular defense system against environmental stresses such as heat shock, oxidative stress, or the treatment with chemical agents (48Subjeck J.R. Shyy T.T. Am. J. Physiol. 1986; 250: C1-C17Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 49Gehrmann M. Pfister K. Hutzler P. Gastpar R. Margulis B. Multhoff G. Biol. Chem. 2002; 383: 1715-1725PubMed Google Scholar). Consistent with these findings, we found that Hsp70 up-regulation plays a cytoprotective role in response to the Eg5 inhibitor dimethylenastron, as blocking Hsp70 induction either directly by expressing antisense RNA/small interfering RNA or indirectly by inhibiting the PI3K/Akt pathway dramatically increased dimethylenastron-induced apoptosis. Although Hsp70 induction may involve different mechanisms under different circumstances, its ability to promote cell survival is likely related to its anti-apoptotic effect per se. It is well established that Hsp70 regulates pro-apoptotic proteins negatively to inhibit apoptosis. For example, Hsp70 can directly bind to AIF to antagonize AIF-dependent apoptosis (42Ravagnan L. Gurbuxani S. Susin S.A. Maisse C. Daugas E. Zamzami N. Mak T. Jaattela M. Penninger J.M. Garrido C. Kroemer G. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 839-843Crossref PubMed Scopus (749) Google Scholar). Hsp70 also binds to Apaf-1 to prevent the recruitment of caspases to the apoptosome complex and thereby to block the apoptotic signaling relay (40Saleh A. Srinivasula S.M. Balkir L. Robbins P.D. Alnemri E.S. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 476-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (736) Google Scholar, 41Beere H.M. Wolf B.B. Cain K. Mosser D.D. Mahboubi A. Kuwana T. Tailor P. Morimoto R.I. Cohen G.M. Green D.R. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 469-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (1287) Google Scholar). In addition, Hsp70 physically associates with ASK1 to block its homo-oligomerization, inhibiting apoptotic cell death (43Park H.S. Cho S.G. Kim C.K. Hwang H.S. Noh K.T. Kim M.S. Huh S.H. Kim M.J. Ryoo K. Kim E.K. Kang W.J. Lee J.S. Seo J.S. Ko Y.G. Kim S. Choi E.J. Mol. Cell Biol. 2002; 22: 7721-7730Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Our finding that inhibition of Hsp70 induction increased dimethylena-stron-induced apoptosis is consistent with the anti-apoptotic role of Hsp70. Our results also reveal Hsp70 up-regulation as a critical mechanism modulating myeloma cell sensitivity to Eg5 inhibitors. On the other hand, our findings indicate that abrogating Hsp70 induction is important in increasing Eg5 inhibitor sensitivity. Furthermore, we found that the FTI277 interacted synergistically with the Eg5 inhibitor dimethylenastron to induce apoptosis in myeloma cells. Importantly, FTI277 interruption of dimethylenastron-induced Akt/Hsp70 signaling cascade underlies directly the synergistic combination of these two agents. These results suggest that a combination of Eg5 inhibitors with agents abrogating Hsp70 induction like FTIs may be more useful in myeloma therapy. In summary, we have shown that inhibition of the mitotic kinesin Eg5 by a specific inhibitor leads to mitotic arrest, apoptosis, and Hsp70 up-regulation in human multiple myeloma cells. Hsp70 induction appears to be an early event and is mediated by the PI3K/Akt pathway. In addition, Hsp70 up-regulation has been found to play a cytoprotective role, and disruption of the Akt/Hsp70 signaling axis can greatly potentiate Eg5 inhibitor-induced apoptosis. These findings offer the first evidence for Eg5 inhibitor activity in hematologic malignancy and provide novel insights into the mechanisms underlying Eg5 inhibitor sensitivity. Our results also suggest that a combination of Eg5 inhibitors with agents abrogating Hsp70 induction is a promising approach in treating multiple myeloma for which no curative therapies exist to date.

https://openalex.org/W2030371377,"Mutational inactivation of p53 is only one of the ways that tumors lose p53 function. An alternate route is through overexpression of HDM2, the negative regulator of p53. To further understand how excess HDM2 regulates p53-mediated functions, we generated H1299 cell clones that constitutively express both ectopic HDM2 and tetracycline-regulated inducible p53. We found that over a range of p53 concentrations constitutively expressed HDM2 did not affect the levels of p53 protein. Nevertheless, cells with excess HDM2 displayed numerous changes in their response to p53. After DNA damage, such cells had both increased p53-mediated G2 arrest and reduced cell death. They also showed selective impairment of p53 target gene induction in that some p53 targets were unaffected whereas others were markedly less well induced in the presence of extra HDM2 protein. We also found that excess HDM2 was correlated with reduced p53 acetylation but did not affect p53 association with target promoters in vivo. Indeed, there was no significant difference in the amount of HDM2 associated with p53 at target promoters that differed in their expression depending on the presence of extra HDM2. Thus, HDM2 can selectively down-regulate the transcription function of p53 without either degrading p53 or affecting the interaction of p53 with target promoters.

The p53 tumor suppressor gene is most frequently mutated in human cancers (1Vogelstein B. Lane D. Levine A.J. Nature. 2000; 408: 307-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (5844) Google Scholar), suggesting that p53 plays a critical role in the control of cell growth. p53 is a transcription factor that modulates the transcription of a large number of target genes in response to various cellular stresses such as DNA damage, hypoxia, heat shock, and viral infection (1Vogelstein B. Lane D. Levine A.J. Nature. 2000; 408: 307-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (5844) Google Scholar, 2Levine A.J.

The activation of p53 leads to diverse cellular processes, including cell cycle regulation, apoptosis, senescence, and differentiation. The activity of p53 is regulated by multiple mechanisms. Post-translational modifications of p53 may change its half-life, intracellular localization, conformation, DNA binding, and interaction with regulatory proteins (1Vogelstein B. Lane D. Levine A.J.

Murine double minute clone 2 (mdm2) was originally cloned as an amplified gene in a spontaneously transformed Balb/c cell line 3T3DM (7Cahilly-Snyder L. Yang-Feng T. Francke U. George D.L. Somatic Cell Mol. Genet. 1987; 13: 235-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar, 8Fakharzadeh S.S. Trusko S.P. George D.L. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 1565-1569Crossref PubMed Scopus (628) Google Scholar). The human homologue of Mdm2 (HDM2) is also frequently amplified in some human cancers, especially in sarcomas and brain tumors (reviewed in Ref. 1Vogelstein B. Lane D. Levine A.J. Nature. 2000; 408: 307-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (5844) Google Scholar). In such tumors p53 is often wild type, consistent with the supposition that HDM2 inactivation of p53 can at least partially phenocopy mutation of p53 itself. HDM2 regulates p53-mediated growth suppression and apoptosis by inhibiting p53 (9Chen J. Wu X. Lin J. Levine A.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2445-2452Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). Because HDM2 is a transcriptional target of p53 (10Barak Y. Juven T. Haffner R. Oren M. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 461-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (1181) Google Scholar, 11Wu X. Bayle J.H. Olson D. Levine A.J. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 1126-1132Crossref PubMed Scopus (1645) Google Scholar), HDM2 and p53 form a negative feedback loop in which p53 activates HDM2 which in turn down-regulates p53. HDM2 can bind to the N-terminal transcriptional activation domain of p53 (12Chen J. Marechal V. Levine A.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 4107-4114Crossref PubMed Scopus (624) Google Scholar, 13Oliner J.D. Pietenpol J.A. Thiagalingam S. Gyuris J. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Nature. 1993; 362: 857-860Crossref PubMed Scopus (1309) Google Scholar) and modulates p53 function by several ways. First, HDM2 can block the transactivation ability of p53 (13Oliner J.D. Pietenpol J.A. Thiagalingam S. Gyuris J. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Nature. 1993; 362: 857-860Crossref PubMed Scopus (1309) Google Scholar, 14Momand J. Zambetti G.P. Olson D.C. George D. Levine A.J.

Although the interaction of HDM2 and p53 is needed for inhibition of p53-mediated transactivation, HDM2 itself possesses a domain that can directly repress basal transcription (15Thut C.J. Goodrich J.A. Tjian R. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 1974-1986Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). Second, HDM2 functions as a ubiquitin-protein isopeptide ligase and facilitates degradation of p53 by the proteasome (16Honda R. Tanaka H. Yasuda H. FEBS Lett. 1997; 420: 25-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (1604) Google Scholar, 17Haupt Y. Maya R. Kazaz A. Oren M. Nature. 1997; 387: 296-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (3743) Google Scholar, 18Kubbutat M.H.

The C terminus of HDM2 spans its RING domain, which is essential for HDM2 ubiquitin ligase activity toward p53 and itself (20Fang S. Jensen J.P. Ludwig R.L. Vousden K.H. Weissman A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8945-8951Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (874) Google Scholar, 21Honda R. Yasuda H. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 1473-1476Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). Third, HDM2 plays a role in translocation of p53 from the nucleus to the cytoplasm (22Geyer R.K. Yu Z.K. Maki C.G. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 569-573Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar, 23Boyd S.D. Tsai K.Y. Jacks T. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 563-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). This activity requires the nuclear export signal of p53, and ubiquitination of the C terminus of p53 by HDM2 contributes to the efficient export of p53 (24Lohrum M.A. Woods D.B. Ludwig R.L. Balint E. Vousden K.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 8521-8532Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). In addition, HDM2 is a potential inhibitor of p53 acetylation (25Ito A. Lai C.H. Zhao X. Saito S. Hamilton M.H. Appella E. Yao T.P. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 1331-1340Crossref PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar, 26Ito A. Kawaguchi Y. Lai C.H. Kovacs J.J. Higashimoto Y. Appella E. Yao T.P.

Manley J.L. Cell. 2001; 107: 815-818Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). Until recently most reports investigated the functional regulation of p53 by HDM2 by either transient overexpression or in vitro assays, although at least two reports have provided evidence that excess endogenously expressed HDM2 can dramatically affect p53 function. First, Knights et al. (30Knights C.D. Liu Y. Appella E. Kulesz-Martin M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 52890-52900Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) characterized cells with or without amplified Mdm2 that were derived from carcinogen-treated murine epidermal 291 cells and identified deficiencies in p53 responses and activities in cells with excess Mdm2. Second, Bond et al. (31Bond G.L. Hu W. Bond E.E. Robins H. Lutzker S.G. Arva N.C. Bargonetti J. Bartel F. Taubert H. Wuerl P. Onel K. Yip L. Hwang S.J. Strong L.C. Lozano G. Levine A.J. Cell. 2004; 119: 591-602Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1062) Google Scholar) discovered that a single nucleotide polymorphism in the human HDM2 promoter creates a strong Sp1-binding site and thereby results in increased HDM2 expression that is correlated with both defective p53 response in cell cultures and increased cancer susceptibility in the human population. Our goal was to investigate how excess HDM2 regulates the function of p53 in vivo by using isogenic stable H1299 cell lines that both contain tetracycline-regulated inducible p53 and constitutively express FLAG-tagged HDM2. By using this approach we can change the ratio of p53 and HDM2 protein and measure the function of p53 in the same genetic background. We observed that degradation of p53 is not the dominant mode by which HDM2 inhibits the function of p53 in these cells and that HDM2 can selectively down-regulate the ability of p53 to regulate expression of endogenous target genes. Plasmids—Human HDM2 containing two N-terminal FLAG epitope tags and a C-terminal HA epitope tag was generated and amplified by PCR (Expand High Fidelity PCR System, Roche Applied Science) and cloned onto pcDNA3 (Invitrogen) to generate pcDNA/F-HDM2. The human p53 expression plasmid was a gift from B. Vogelstein. The pTK-Hyg and pEGFP-F constructs were from Clontech. Cell Lines and Transfection—The cell lines used in this study are all clonally derived from H1299 human non-small cell lung carcinoma cells. A cell line expressing tetracycline-regulated p53 (H24-14) was described previously (32Chen X. Ko L.J. Jayaraman L. Prives C. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2438-2451Crossref PubMed Scopus (660) Google Scholar). Cells were grown in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (HyClone). H24-14 cells were cultured in the presence of puromycin (2 μg/ml; Sigma), G418 (400 μg/ml; Invitrogen), and tetracycline (4 μg/ml; Sigma). To establish cell lines that both contain inducible p53 and constitutively expressed HDM2, pcDNA/F-HDM2 and pTK-Hyg were transfected into H24-14 cultures using Lipofectamine (Invitrogen). Clones were isolated and expanded in the presence of 400 and 300 μg of hygromycin B (Invitrogen) per ml, respectively. Expression of FLAG-HDM2-HA in isolated clones was detected by immunoblotting analysis of the cell extracts. One of the clones that express FLAG-HDM2-HA at relatively high levels when compared with other clones was selected for the experiments and designated as H24-14/HDM2#1. Additional clones were also isolated and characterized. To confirm characteristics of FLAG- and HA-tagged HDM2, H1299 cells were seeded 24 h before transfection on 10-cm dishes and then transfected with 5 μg of p53 expression plasmid with or without 5 μg of pcDNA/F-HDM2 using Lipofectamine. 24 h after transfection, the levels of p53 and FLAG-HDM2-HA were determined by immunoblotting. The binding ability of FLAG-HDM2-HA to p53 was determined by immunoprecipitation experiments. Flow Cytometry Analysis—Both adherent and detached cells were collected and fixed with 5 ml of ice-cold methanol for 1 h at –20°C. The fixed cells were suspended in PBS 2The abbreviations used are: PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; RT, reverse transcription; HA, hemagglutinin; ChIP, chromatin immunoprecipitation; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; FACS, fluorescence-activated cell sorter. containing RNase A (50 μg/ml; Sigma) and propidium iodide (60 μg/ml; Sigma). The stained cells were analyzed in a fluorescence-activated cell sorter (FACSCalibur, BD Biosciences), and data were analyzed with ModFit LT software. Antibodies—Monoclonal antibodies PAb1801 and DO-1 were used to detect p53, and monoclonal antibodies SMP-14 and 2A10 were used to detect HDM2. PIG3 antibody was a generous gift from D. Hill (Oncogene Research Products). The cyclin G1 polyclonal antibody (33Okamoto K. Li H. Jensen M.R. Zhang T. Taya Y. Thorgeirsson S.S. Prives C. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 761-771Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar), the anti-acetyl p53 antibody at lysine 382 (34Latonen L. Taya Y. Laiho M. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 6784-6793Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar), and the anti-phospho-p53 antibodies at serine 15 or at serine 392 (35Shieh S.Y. Ikeda M. Taya Y. Prives C. Cell. 1997; 91: 325-334Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1760) Google Scholar, 36Lu H. Taya Y. Ikeda M. Levine A.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 6399-6402Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar) were described previously. Other primary antibodies for the detection of various proteins were purchased from the following sources: anti-p53 (FL393; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-FLAG M2 (Sigma), anti-Bax (sc-493; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-actin (Sigma), anti-p21 (Ab-1; Oncogene Research Products), and anti-GFP (JL-8; Clontech). Immunoblotting and Immunoprecipitation—48 h after removal of tetracycline, cells were washed in PBS and lysed in buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 10 mm NaF, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 5 μm trichostatin A, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 3 μg/ml leupeptin, 3 μg/ml pepstatin A, and 10 μg/ml aprotinin. Lysates were then centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 20 min, and the supernatants were collected. Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane (Schleicher & Schuell). Membranes were blocked with 5% nonfat dried milk in PBST (PBS, 0.05% Tween 20) and probed with appropriate antibodies. For immunoprecipitation, PAb 1801 was covalently attached to Protein A-Sepharose (1801 beads) (Amersham Biosciences). Cell lysates were incubated with 1801 beads or anti-FLAG M2-agarose affinity gel (Sigma) for 4 h at 4°C, and the immunoprecipitates were then washed four times in lysis buffer, boiled in electrophoresis sample buffer for 5 min, and used for immunoblotting as described above. Immunostaining—Cells were plated onto coverslips and cultured with or without tetracycline (4 μg/ml) for 48 h. Cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 20 min and then incubated with 0.2% Triton X-100 for 5 min. After blocking, the coverslips were incubated with anti-p53 (FL393) and anti-HDM2 (SMP-14) followed by incubation with anti-rabbit Alexa Fluor 488 conjugate (Molecular Probes) and antimouse Alexa Fluor 594 conjugate (Molecular Probes). Nuclei were visualized by 4′, 6′-diamidino-2-phenylindole (Sigma) staining. RT-PCR—48 h after removal of tetracycline, total RNA was isolated by use of an RNeasy kit (Qiagen), and contaminating DNA was digested with 10 units of DNase I (Promega) at 37°C for 30 min. The total RNA (5μg) was then reverse-transcribed using the ThermoScript RT-PCR system (Invitrogen), and 5% of the cDNA products was subjected to PCR using the Expand High Fidelity PCR system (Roche Applied Science) with five different pairs of primers as follows: pig3 oligonucleotides, 5′-CCGGGGGAGGGTGAAGTC-3′/5′-TCCAGCCATCCGGGTGAGTTG-3′; p21 oligonucleotides, 5′-CTCTAAGGTTGGGCAGGGTG-3′/5′-GAAGAAGGGTAGCTGGGGCTC-3′; bax oligonucleotides, 5′-GGGGACGAACTGGACAGTAAC-3′/5′-CAGTTGAAGTTGCCGTCAGA-3′; 14-3-3σ oligonucleotides, 5-TGGCCAAGACCACTTTCGAC-3′/5′-CATGACCAGTGGTTAGGTGCG-3′; and gapdh oligonucleotides, 5′-CGAGATCCCTCCAAAATCAAG-3′/5′-ATCCACAGTCTTCTGGGTGG-3′. The cycling conditions were as follows: a denaturation step at 94°C for 2 min followed by 20 cycles (for gapdh and p21), or 25 cycles (for pig3, bax, and 14-3-3σ) at 94°C for 30 s, 57°C for 30 s and 72°C for 2 min, as well as a final extension of 72°C for 7 min. PCR products were loaded onto a 1.5% agarose gel and were visualized with ethidium bromide. The stability of p53 target mRNA was determined as described previously (37Ljungman M. Zhang F. Chen F. Rainbow A.J. McKay B.C. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 583-592Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). Cells were treated with actinomycin D (1 mm; Sigma) for the indicated time. After treatment, total RNA was extracted, and the expression of mRNA was analyzed by RT-PCR. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP) Assay—Cells were formaldehyde cross-linked for 10 min at room temperature by adding an equal volume of cross-linking solution (1% formaldehyde in PBS) directly to the culture medium. Cross-linking was stopped by the addition of glycine to a final concentration of 125 mm. Cells were washed twice with ice-cold PBS and collected. Cells were suspended in HEPES-lysis buffer (10 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm EDTA, 400 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 10 mm NaF, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 3 μg/ml leupeptin, 3 μg/ml pepstatin A, and 10 μg/ml aprotinin) and were centrifuged at 11,500 rpm for 5 min at 4°C. Nuclear pellets were resuspended in HEPES-lysis buffer, and chromatin was fragmented to an average size in the range of 600–800 bp using a Sonicator W-220 (Heat Systems Ultrasonics, Inc.). Insoluble material was removed by centrifugation at 13,000 rpm for 10 min at 4°C. The supernatant was diluted 2-fold in HEPES dilution buffer (10 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 1 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 10 mm NaF, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 3 μg/ml leupeptin, 3 μg/ml pepstatin A, and 10 μg/ml aprotinin) and then precleared with Protein A- and G-Sepharose beads for 2 h at 4°C. Aliquots were stored and used for input samples. The precleared chromatin solution was incubated with blocked Protein A- and G-Sepharose beads (preincubated overnight at 4°C with 0.7 mg/ml sonicated salmon sperm DNA and 185 mg/ml bovine serum albumin), and either anti-p53 (1801 and DO-1) or anti-HDM2 (2A10 and SMP-14) antibodies were incubated overnight at 4°C. The beads were washed three times in wash buffer (10 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm EDTA, 200 mm NaCl, and 10% glycerol) and then resuspended in cross-link reversal buffer (125 mm Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), 10% β-mercaptoethanol, and 4% SDS). Antibody-bound chromatin was eluted from the beads by heating at 95°C for 30 min. The DNA was then purified using the QIAquick PCR purification kit (Qiagen). Input and immunoprecipitated DNAs were amplified by PCR. PCR was performed using the following primers: p21 (distal), 5′-CTGGACTGGGCACTCTTGTC-3′ and 5′-CTCCTACCATCCCCTTCCTC-3′; p21 (proximal), 5′-TCTGGGGTTTAGCCACAATC-3′ and 5′-CTGACATCTCAGGCTGCTCA-3′; PIG3 (5′ upstream), 5′-AGGAGGCGAGTGATAAGGATCC-3′ and 5′-AACCTCTTGGCGGGCGGATTGG-3′; PIG3 (microsatellite), 5′-GGGCGCTGCGGTGCCAGCCTGAG-3′ and 5′-ACCTTCAGGAGGACTTCACC-3′; and GAPDH, 5′-CACTGGAGCCTTCATCTCAG-3′ and 5′-CTGTTGCTGGCCAGCAACTG-3′. PCR samples were resolved on 2% agarose gels. Establishment of H1299 Cell Clones That Contain Inducible p53 and Constitutively Express Exogenous HDM2—To gain more insight as to how HDM2 modulates the function of p53, our goal was to generate cell clones that both contain inducible p53 and constitutively express exogenous HDM2. To distinguish between endogenous and exogenous HDM2, we used a version of HDM2 that has two FLAG epitope tags at its N terminus and an HA epitope tag at the C terminus (F-HDM2). Because tag sequences may inhibit the function of proteins, we tested the capability of F-HDM2 to interact with and degrade p53 by co-transfecting a p53 expression plasmid into H1299 cells with or without the F-HDM2 expression plasmid (supplemental Fig. 1A). As shown previously, overexpression of F-HDM2 significantly (∼50%) decreased the level of co-expressed p53 (supplemental Fig. 1A, lanes 2 and 4) (17Haupt Y. Maya R. Kazaz A. Oren M. Nature. 1997; 387: 296-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (3743) Google Scholar, 18Kubbutat M.H. Jones S.N. Vousden K.H. Nature. 1997; 387: 299-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (2857) Google Scholar, 19Midgley C.A. Lane D.P. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 1179-1189Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). We showed previously that when higher ratios of HDM2 to p53 constructs (e.g. between 5 and 10:1) were introduced into H1299 cells there was an even greater extent of p53 degradation (38Poyurovsky M.V. Jacq X. Ma C. Karni-Schmidt O. Parker P.J. Chalfie M. Manley J.L. Prives C. Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 875-887Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Furthermore, when F-HDM2 was cotransfected with p53, their interaction was confirmed using an immunoprecipitation-immunoblotting assay in which p53 was immunoprecipitated by anti-FLAG antibody in the presence of F-HDM2 but not in the absence of F-HDM2 (supplemental Fig. 1B, lanes 8 and 7). Similarly, F-HDM2 was immunoprecipitated by anti-p53 antibody in the presence of p53 but not in its absence (supplemental Fig. 1B, lanes 4 and 2). Thus doubly FLAG- and HA-tagged HDM2 when overexpressed is capable of binding and degrading p53. We used a previously well characterized H1299 clone (H24-14) expressing tetracycline-regulated wild type p53 (32Chen X. Ko L.J. Jayaraman L. Prives C. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2438-2451Crossref PubMed Scopus (660) Google Scholar). These cells express relatively low levels of p53 upon withdrawal of tetracycline that is within the range of endogenous p53 induced by DNA damage (32Chen X. Ko L.J. Jayaraman L. Prives C. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2438-2451Crossref PubMed Scopus (660) Google Scholar, 39Baptiste N. Friedlander P. Chen X. Prives C. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 9-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). We established several clones expressing F-HDM2 as described under “Materials and Methods,” and one of them (H24-14/HDM2#1) that expressed relatively high levels of F-HDM2 was selected for further experiments. By using this clone, we were able to change the ratio of p53 and HDM2 protein and thereby measure the function of p53 in the same genetic background. Constitutively Expressed Tagged HDM2 Does Not Affect the Level or Localization of p53 Protein—We first examined the levels of p53 and HDM2 in H24-14/HDM2#1 cells with and without induced p53 (Fig. 1A). As shown previously, low concentrations of tetracycline allowed for a partial expression of p53, whereas more complete withdrawal of tetracycline caused a greater amount of p53 to accumulate in H24-14 (Fig. 1A) (32Chen X. Ko L.J. Jayaraman L. Prives C. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2438-2451Crossref PubMed Scopus (660) Google Scholar). As expected, endogenous HDM2 levels were increased upon induction of p53. Most interestingly, two different endogenous HDM2 polypeptides induced by p53 were resolved, although the more rapidly migrating species was predominant. In H24-14/HDM2#1 cells, F-HDM2 migrated with a very similar mobility to that of the slower mobility species of endogenous HDM2. Most surprisingly, F-HDM2 levels were increased along with the levels of induced p53 by a mechanism we do not understand. Because of this increase in F-HDM2, we estimate that at each concentration of tetracycline, ∼2-fold more HDM2 (combined ectopic and endogenous) was expressed in H24-14/HDM2#1 cells compared with H24-14 cells. Although H24-14/HDM2#1 cells also expressed p53 in a tetracycline dose-dependent manner, unexpectedly, over a range of tetracycline in the medium, the levels of p53 were essentially identical to those in H24-14 cells that lacked extra HDM2. Thus the extra HDM2 apparently did not increase degradation of p53. This is not unique to this clone of H24-14 cells; when p53 levels were measured in four other stable clones, there were no differences seen at any dose of tetracycline regardless of the presence of F-HDM2 (data not shown). Furthermore, we confirmed that stably expressed F-HDM2 was associated with p53 by performing a co-immunoprecipitation assay in which p53 was detected in the anti-FLAG antibody immunoprecipitate in the presence of F-HDM2 but not in the absence of F-HDM2 (Fig. 2A). Reciprocally, both endogenous HDM2 and F-HDM2 were immunoprecipitated by the anti-p53 antibody (Fig. 2B). Interestingly, only the faster mobility endogenous HDM2 species was immunoprecipitated by anti-p53 antibody upon withdrawal of tetracycline in H24-14 cells (Fig. 2B, lane 2). Thus, although F-HDM2 forms a complex with p53 in H24-14/HDM2#1 cells, it is unlikely to cause p53 degradation.FIGURE 2Constitutively expressed tagged HDM2 forms a complex with p53 in H24-14/HDM2#1 cells. A, H24-14/HDM2#1 cells were grown in the presence (4μg/ml) or absence of tetracycline (Tet) for 48 h. Cell extracts were prepared and immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG M2-agarose. Immunoprecipitates were used for immunoblotting analysis probed with anti-p53 antibody (PAb1801) and anti-HDM2 antibody (SMP-14). B, H24-14 and H24-14/HDM2#1 cells were grown in the absence of tetracycline for 48 h. Cell extracts were prepared and immunoprecipitated with anti-p53 1801 beads.

EMBO J. 1998; 17: 554-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (532) Google Scholar), we determined the intracellular localization of p53 with or without extra HDM2 by immunofluorescence (supplemental Fig. 2). Note that although it is possible to clearly discern the extra HDM2 in H24-14/HDM2#1 cells without p53 induction, the increase in detectable HDM2 when p53 is fully induced is more subtle, possibly because differences in immunofluorescence are not quantitative under these conditions. Induced p53 and endogenous HDM2 mainly accumulated in the nucleus in H24-14/HDM2#1 cells. F-HDM2 was also located in the nucleus, and induced p53 co-localized with both endogenous and FLAG-tagged HDM2 in this cell line. Excess HDM2 Selectively Impairs Expression of Downstream Targets of p53—We examined different transcriptional targets of p53 in the presence or absence of excess HDM2. Using aliquots of the same cell extracts as in Fig. 1A, protein levels of a number of p53 targets were detected by specific antibodies (Fig. 1B). In both cell lines, the levels of these target proteins were increased along with the levels of p53 itself. Although there was no significant effect of extra HDM2 on accumulation of either p21 or Bax proteins, we observed that PIG3 and cyclin G1 (not shown) proteins were less efficiently induced in H24-14/HDM2#1 than in H24-14 cells. Note that in the experiment shown without extra HDM2, p21 and Bax were expressed at slightly greater levels than with extra HDM2 at 2.5 ng/ml tetracycline (Fig. 1B, lane 4 and 9), their levels were very similar after normalization with the amounts of β-actin. When we determined the accumulation of different p53 target mRNAs by RT-PCR analysis, the presence of extra HDM2 did not appreciably affect p21 or Bax expression, although both 14-3-3σ and PIG-3 mRNA levels were markedly reduced in cells with extra HDM2 (Fig. 1C). To clarify whether the specific reduction of PIG3 mRNA expression in the presence of excess HDM2 is a result of suppressed gene transcription or mRNA stability, we examined the rate of p21 and PIG3 mRNA decay with or without excess HDM2 following inhibition of nascent RNA transcription by actinomycin D. In both cell lines, the decay of p21 mRNA was very similar at distinct time points over a 12-h period (Fig. 1D). Although PIG3 mRNA was less well induced in the presence of extra HDM2, the decay of its mRNA was very similar with and without excess HDM2 (Fig. 1D). These data indicate that extra HDM2 suppressed PIG3 induction vi"

Although other members of the ERK subfamily are established regulators of signaling pathways involved in cell growth and/or differentiation, less is known about ERK8. To understand the cellular function of ERK8, a yeast two-hybrid screen of a human lung library was performed to identify binding partners. One binding partner identified was Hic-5 (also known as ARA55), a multiple LIM domain containing protein implicated in focal adhesion signaling and the regulation of specific nuclear receptors, including the androgen receptor and the glucocorticoid receptor (GR). Co-immunoprecipitation experiments in mammalian cells confirmed the interaction between Hic-5 and both ERK8 and its rodent ortholog ERK7. The C-terminal region of ERK8 was not required for the interaction. Although the LIM3 and LIM4 domains of Hic-5 were sufficient and required for this interaction, the specific zinc finger motifs in these domains were not. Transcriptional activation reporter assays revealed that ERK8 can negatively regulate transcriptional co-activation of androgen receptor and GRα by Hic-5 in a kinase-independent manner. Knockdown of endogenous ERK8 in human airway epithelial cells enhanced dexamethasone-stimulated transcriptional activity of endogenous GR. Transcriptional regulation of GRα and interaction with its ligand binding domain by ERK8 were dependent on the presence of Hic-5. These results provide the first physiological function for human ERK8 as a negative regulator of human GRα, acting through Hic-5, and suggest a broader role for ERK8 in the regulation of nuclear receptors beyond estrogen receptor α.

ERK1 and ERK2 are classically activated by growth factors and mediate signals leading to proliferation or differentiation of most cell types (1Lewis T.S. Shapiro P.S. Ahn N.G. Adv. Cancer Res. 1998; 74: 49-139Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Robinson M.J. Cobb M.H. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 180-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (2278) Google Scholar). These founding members of the ERK subfamily of MAPKs have a characteristic threonine-glutamine-tyrosine (TEY) motif that requires dual phosphorylation of the threonine and tyrosine residues for full kinase activity. ERK3 is an atypical member of the ERK/MAPK family having an SEG activation motif. Recently, it has been found to interact with and facilitate MAPK-activated protein kinase 5 (MK5) autoactivation (3Seternes O.M. Mikalsen T. Johansen B. Michaelsen E. Armstrong C.G. Morrice N.A.

EMBO J. 2004; 23: 4770-4779Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). This interaction may play a role in embryonic development. These proteins have overlapping expression patterns in the developing mouse embryo, and there is concurrent reduction of ERK3 in an MK5 knock-out mouse model resulting in embryonic lethality (3Seternes O.M. Mikalsen T. Johansen B. Michaelsen E. Armstrong C.G. Morrice N.A. Turgeon B. Meloche S. Moens U. Keyse S.M. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 4780-4791Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 4Schumacher S.

ERK4 was identified by immunologic cross-reactivity with an antibody against ERK1 (5Peng X. Angelastro J.M. Greene L.A. J. Neurochem. 1996; 66: 1191-1197Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Little is known about ERK4, including its primary sequence (6Bogoyevitch M.A. Court N.W. Cell. Signal. 2004; 16: 1345-1354Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). ERK5 has a TEY activation motif and was originally identified as an oxidant-activated ERK (7Abe J. Kusuhara M. Ulevitch R.J. Berk B.C. Lee J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16586-16590Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar). Subsequently, it has been found to be activated along a growth factor signaling pathway and to play an important role in angiogenesis and T-cell development. ERK6 has a TGY activation motif and is actually a member of the p38 family of MAPKs also known as p38γ (8Li Z. Jiang Y. Ulevitch R.J. Han J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 228: 334-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar, 9Lechner C. Zahalka M.A. Giot J.F. Moller N.P. Ullrich A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 4355-4359Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). ERK7 has a TEY activation motif but is also an atypical member of the ERK family in that it displays considerable constitutive kinase activity independent of a known upstream activator (10Abe M.K. Kahle K.K. Saelzler M.P. Orth K. Dixon J.E. Rosner M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 21272-21279Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). ERK8 is the last member of this MAPK subfamily to be identified (11Abe M.K. Saelzler M.P. Espinosa R. III Kahle Hershenson K.T. M. B. Le Beau Rosner M. M.M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 16733-16743Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Although a relatively low amino acid sequence identity of 69% and initial biochemical characterization of human ERK8 suggested that it might be distinct from rodent ERK7, genome-based analyses revealed that these ERKs are orthologs (12Consortium M.G.S. Nature. 2002; 420: 520-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (5352) Google Scholar, 13Team M.G.C.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 16899-16903Crossref PubMed Scopus (1551) Google Scholar). Their genes are in syntenic regions with erk8 located on human 8q24.3 (11Abe M.K. Saelzler M.P. Espinosa R. III Kahle Hershenson K.T. M. B. Le Beau Rosner M. M.M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 16733-16743Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) and erk7 located on mouse 15E1. In addition, their gene structures are similar. The implication of their sequence divergence and distinct biochemical profiles, highly unusual for MAPK orthologs, remains unresolved. ERK8 and ERK7, like ERK3 and ERK5, are significantly larger than the founding ERK family members, ERK1 and ERK2, primarily because of extended C-terminal regions that have important regulatory functions. Previously, overexpression of ERK7 was found to reduce cell growth independent of kinase activity but dependent on its C-terminal region (15Abe M.K. Kuo W.L. Hershenson M.B. Rosner M.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1301-1312Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). More recently, overexpression of rat ERK7 was found to increase turnover of the human estrogen receptor α (ERα) via a 26 S proteosome pathway in a kinase-dependent manner (16Henrich L.M. Smith J.A. Kitt D. Errington T.M. Nguyen B. Traish A.M. Lannigan D.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 5979-5988Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Reduced levels of a cross-reactive human protein, presumably ERK8, inversely correlated with ERα levels in human breast cancer cell lines and some advanced human breast carcinomas (16Henrich L.M. Smith J.A. Kitt D. Errington T.M. Nguyen B. Traish A.M. Lannigan D.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 5979-5988Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) suggesting a potential regulatory role for ERK7 and possibly ERK8 in ERα signaling. ERα is a member of the nuclear receptor superfamily of transcription factors. Additional members of this family include the androgen receptor (AR), the glucocorticoid receptor α (GRα), the mineralocorticoid receptor, the progesterone receptor, the thyroid receptor, the retinoic acid receptors, and the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ (PPARγ). Regulation of gene expression by nuclear receptors is initiated by binding of the specific ligand or hormone, formation of either heteroor homodimers depending on the individual nuclear receptor, and binding to specific sites on the target gene promoter. In addition, co-activator or co-repressor complexes associate with the promoter-bound nuclear receptors to regulate their transcriptional activity. Using the yeast two-hybrid system to screen a human lung library, we identified one such nuclear receptor co-regulator, hydrogen peroxide inducible clone-5 (Hic-5), also known as androgen receptor activator 55 (ARA55). Hic-5 was initially identified as a hydrogen peroxide or transforming growth factor-β1 inducible gene in a mouse osteoblastic cell line (MC3T3-E1). Overexpression of Hic-5 in fibroblasts generated a senescent phenotype (17Shibanuma M. Mashimo J. Kuroki T. Nose K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26767-26774Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Hic-5 was found to localize to focal adhesions and interact with focal adhesion kinase through its N-terminal region (18Fujita H. Kamiguchi K. Cho D. Shibanuma M. Morimoto C. Tachibana K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26516-26521Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Competition with paxillin for focal adhesion kinase binding was proposed as the mechanism behind the ability of Hic-5 overexpression to reduce integrin-mediated cell spreading (19Nishiya N. Tachibana K. Shibanuma M. Mashimo J. Nose K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 5332-5345Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Hic-5 was also found to be a strong ligand-dependent co-activator of a subset of nuclear receptors in addition to AR (20Fujimoto N. Yeh S. Kang H.Y. Inui S. Chang H.C. Mizokami A. Chang C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8316-8321Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar), including GRα, progesterone receptor, mineralocorticoid receptor, and PPARγ but not thyroid receptor or ERα (20Fujimoto N. Yeh S. Kang H.Y. Inui S. Chang H.C. Mizokami A. Chang C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8316-8321Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar, 21Yang L. Guerrero J. Hong H.

Spiegelman B.M. Genes Dev. 2005; 19: 362-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). In general, the co-activation function of Hic-5 is dependent on one or more of its LIM domains, which are cysteine- and/or histidine-rich regions that resemble zinc fingers. Here we demonstrate that ERK8 interacts with Hic-5 via its C-terminal LIM3 and LIM4 domains. This interaction is required for the ability of ERK8 to down-regulate transcription of GRα in a kinase-independent manner. These results suggest that one potential function of ERK8 is to negatively regulate nuclear receptor transcription through an interaction with Hic-5.

Cell Culture—Normal human bronchial epithelial cells were purchased from Cambrex (Walkersville, MD) and cultured in Bronchial Epithelial Growth Medium (Cambrex). COS, MCF-7, T-47D, HeLa, NCI-H292, and A549 cells were obtained from American Type Culture Collection. COS and HeLa cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and antibiotics (50 units/ml penicillin and 50 μg/ml streptomycin). MCF-7 and T-47D cells were cultured in modified Eagle's medium + Earle's salts supplemented with 10% FBS, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, 0.1 mm non-essential amino acids, 0.01 mg/ml bovine insulin, and antibiotics.

All cells were maintained at 37 °C in a 95% air, 5% CO2 atmosphere. Transient Transfections and Preparation of Cell Extracts—COS, 16HBE14o–, and MCF-7 cells were transfected using TransIT LT-1 following the manufacturer's instructions. For a 100-mm plate of cells, a total of 8 μg of plasmid DNA was used with 16 or 24 μl of TransIt LT-1. Cultured cells were washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and lysed with either 1% Triton-based lysis buffer (TLB), as described previously (11Abe M.K. Saelzler M.P. Espinosa R.

Western Analysis—Cell extracts (10–60 μg of protein per lane) were resolved on an 8 or 10% acrylamide separating gel by SDS-PAGE. Proteins were transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. Membrane blocking, washing, antibody incubation, and detection by enhanced chemiluminescence were performed as described previously (11Abe M.K. Saelzler M.P. Espinosa R. III Kahle Hershenson K.T. M.

Proteins were isolated by SDS-PAGE on an 8% acrylamide separating gel and subjected to Western analysis. GST Fusion Protein Pulldown—Lysates from transfected COS cells were adjusted to a final concentration of 1 mg/ml and incubated with glutathione-Sepharose at 4 °C for 90 min. The glutathione-Sepharose beads were collected by brief centrifugation and washed extensively with TLB. Isolated proteins were eluted with 1× Laemmli sample buffer, heated at 95 °C for 5 min, and subsequently processed as described above for Western analysis. Luciferase Reporter Assay—Cells were cultured in medium containing 10% charcoal-stripped FBS and transfected with 1.8 μg of pCR3.1, pCR.31 HA-ERK8, or pCR3.1 HA-ERK8 K42R; 0.9 μg of pFLAG or pFLAG-Hic-5; 0.3 μg of pSG5-hGRα or pcDNA3-hAR; 1.0 μg of MMTV-Luc or 3xARE-Luc; and 0.25 μg of pRL-SV40 per 6-well plate. COS, MCF-7, and 16HBE14o– cells were used at a density of 1 × 105, 2.5 × 105, and 1.5 × 105 cells/well, respectively. After 16–24 h, the cells were stimulated with either the ligand (10 nm DHT or 100 nm dexamethasone) or vehicle (ethanol). After an additional 16–24 h, the cells were lysed using Passive Lysis Buffer (Promega) and analyzed using the dual-luciferase reporter assay system (Promega) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Measurements were made using a TD-20/20 luminometer (Turner Designs). Triplicate samples were used for each experiment, and the firefly luciferase measurement was normalized to the Renilla luciferase for each sample. The fold increase was determined by comparing the mean normalized luciferase activity of each treatment group with the vector-transfected, vehicle-treated group within each experiment. siRNA Knockdown—HeLa or 16HBE14o– cells were transfected with siRNA at a final concentration of 20 nm using Lipofectamine 2000 according to the manufacturer's protocol (Invitrogen). A final siRNA concentration ranging from 10 to 100 nm was used when attempting to knock down Hic-5 in 16HBE14o– cells. For the luciferase reporter assay, co-transfection of 16HBE14o– cells with the MMTV-Luc and pRL-SV40 reporter plasmids was performed with the siRNA transfection using Lipofectamine 2000 as described above. The total plasmid amount was maintained using empty vectors. Cells were harvested 48 h following the co-transfections for RNA isolation, Western analysis, or measurement of luciferase activity. RNA Isolation, Reverse Transcription, and Real Time PCR—Two-step, singleplex real time PCR was performed. Total RNA isolation and RT were performed using the RNAqueous-4PCR kit (Ambion) according to the manufacturer's protocol. 2 μg of RNase-free DNase I-treated total RNA of each sample were used per RT reaction with the oligo(dT) primer and either MMLV-RT or water. The samples were denatured at 80 °C, annealed at 42 °C for 60 min, heat-inactivated at 92 °C for 10 min, and cooled to 4 °C. Real time PCRs were performed on an Applied Biosystems 7300 Real Time PCR System running sequence detection software version 1.2.3.

However, the molecular mechanism to modulate such relationships between HSPs and HSF1 is not clear. In the present study, we show that stable transfection of either Hsp25 or inducible Hsp70 (Hsp70i) increased expression of endogenous HSPs such as HSP25 and HSP70i through HSF1 activation. However, these phenomena were abolished when the dominant negative Hsf1 mutant was transfected to HSP25 or HSP70i overexpressed cells. Moreover, the increased HSF1 activity by either HSP25 or HSP70i was found to result from dephosphorylation of HSF1 on serine 307 that increased the stability of HSF1. Either HSP25 or HSP70i inhibited ERK1/2 phosphorylation because of increased MKP1 phosphorylation by direct interaction of these HSPs with MKP1. Treatment of HOS and NCI-H358 cells, which showed high expressions of endogenous HSF1, with small interfering RNA (siRNA) of either HSP27 (siHSP27)or HSP70i (siHSP70i) inhibited both HSP27 and HSP70i proteins; this was because of increased ERK1/2 phosphorylation and serine phosphorylation of HSF1. The results, therefore, suggested that when the HSF1 protein level was high in cancer cells, excess expression of HSP27 or HSP70i strongly facilitates the expression of HSP proteins through HSF1 activation, resulting in severe radio- or chemoresistance.

Med. 1999; 31: 261-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar). Considering the key role of HSPs played in protection against stress-induced damage, it is of great importance to elucidate the regulatory mechanisms responsible for HSP expression. The inducible HSP expression is regulated by the heat shock transcription factors (HSFs). In response to various inducers such as elevated temperatures, oxidants, heavy metals, and bacterial and viral infections, most HSFs acquire DNA binding activity to the heat shock element (HSE), thereby mediating transcription of the heat shock protein genes, which results in accumulation of HSPs (3Wu C.

Although several genes encoding multiple HSF isoforms have been identified in vertebrates (5Sarge K.D. Zimarino V. Holm K. Wu C. Morimoto R.I.

Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1995; 11: 441-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (982) Google Scholar, 12Morimoto R.I. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3788-3796Crossref PubMed Scopus (1545) Google Scholar, 13Pirkkala L.

However, our recent study indicated that, in RIF cells that have relatively low HSP25 and inducible HSP70 (HSP70i) expressions, HSP25 or HSP70i mutually coregulated each other and increased their own protein expression through HSF1 activation (14Lee Y.J. Park G.H. Cho H.N. Cho C.K. Park Y.M. Lee S.J. Lee Y.S. Radiat. Res. 2002; 157: 371-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Recently, it was shown that ERK1/2 activation by mitogenic stimulation leads to phosphorylation of serines 303 and 307 of HSF1 and consequent association of HSF1 with 14-3-3. 14-3-3 binding inhibits both the transcriptional activity and nuclear accumulation of HSF1 (15Wang X. Grammatikakis N. Siganou A. Calderwood S.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 6013-6026Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). HSF1 seems to exert a reciprocal influence on cell proliferation in that HSP70, a major product of HSF1 transcriptional activity, inhibits the ERK pathway. It is intriguing to note that ERK1/2 is known to be a repressor of HSP synthesis (16Mivechi N.F. Giaccia A.J. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 5512-5519PubMed Google Scholar), although HSP induction and ERK1/2 activation result in cytoprotection. HSF1 is subjected to additional layers of regulation, including up-regulation through binding the apoptosis modulator DAXX and modulation by ERK1/2 (17Boellmann F. Guettouche T. Guo Y. Fenna M.

Hierarchical phosphorylation of HSF1 within its transcriptional regulatory domain by ERK1 (on serine 307) and glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK3) (on serine 303) was also reported (19Chu B. Zhong R.

In this study, we attempted to further elucidate molecular mechanisms governing the relationship between HSPs and HSF1, and found that excess expression of HSP25/27 or HSP70i increased endogenous HSPs such as HSP25/27 or HSP70i through HSF1 activation, which resulted from its dephosphorylation of serine 307. Dephosphorylation of HSF1 on serine 307 was mediated by inhibition of ERK1/2 phosphorylation by direct interaction of MKP1 with HSP25 or HSP70i. Interaction between MKP1 and HSP25 or HSP70i increased MKP1 phosphorylation, which resulted in ERK1/2 dephosphorylation. Reagent—Anti-HSP25, anti-HSP70, anti-ERK, anti-phospho-ERK, anti-MKP1, anti-β-actin were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA), anti-HA was from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA), anti-HSF1 was from Neo Marker (Fremont, CA), and anti-phosphoserine was from Sigma. Plasmids—Wild type mouse Hsp25 and inducible Hsp70 were cloned into pcDNA3. The mutant construct, Mkp1 (C258S), was constructed by PCR by using the overlap extension primer. Cysteine was replaced by serine to generate a phosphatase activity-deficient mutant. The mutants Hsf1-S307A and Hsf1-S307D were constructed using the method as described above. Cell Culture—RIF (radiation-induced fibrosarcoma), TR (thermoresistant clone of RIF), HOS (human osteosarcoma), and NCI-H358 (human non-small cell lung cancer) cells were cultured in Dulbecco's minimal essential medium and in RPMI 1640 (Invitrogen) supplemented with heat-inactivated 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen) and antibiotics at 37°C in a humidified incubator with 5% CO2. Cell Transfection—Pre-designed siRNA for human HSP25 and inducible HSP70 (Ambion catalog numbers 19706, 51187, and 16706) and negative control siRNA were purchased from Ambion, Inc. (Austin, TX). The cells were transfected with the siRNAs for 48 h with the use of Lipofectamin™ 2000 (Invitrogen). Transient transfection of all cell types was carried out using Plus Lipofectamine™ reagent (Invitrogen) and Lipofectamine™ reagent. Immunofluorescence Analysis—For immunofluorescence analysis, cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS, and then washed three times with PBS. Cells were then incubated with anti-HSP25/HSP70 and anti-HA diluted 1:200 in PBS with 5% fetal bovine serum for 1 h at room temperature in a humidified chamber. Excess antibody was removed by washing coverslips three times with PBS. Cells were then incubated with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated secondary antibody (Dako, Produktionsvej, Denmark) at 1:200 dilution in PBS with 5% fetal bovine serum for 4 h, and then incubated with 0.5 μg/ml propidium iodide (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR) for 5 min at room temperature. After washing three times with PBS, coverslips were mounted onto microscope slides using ProLong antifade mounting reagent (Molecular Probes). The slides were examined by a confocal laser scanning microscope (Leica Microsystems). Polyacrylamide Gel Electrophoresis and Western Blot—For PAGE and Western blots, cells were solubilized with lysis buffer (120 mm NaCl, 40 mm Tris (pH 8.0), 0.1% Nonidet P-40), the samples were boiled for 5 min, and an equal amount of protein (40 μg/well) was analyzed on 10% SDS-PAGE. After electrophoresis, proteins were transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane and processed for immunoblotting. Blots were further incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody diluted at 1:5,000, and specific bands were visualized by chemiluminescence (ECL, Amersham Biosciences). Autoradiographs were recorded onto X-Omat AR films (Eastman Kodak Co.). Immunoprecipitation—Cells (1 × 107) were lysed in immunoprecipitation buffer (50 mm HEPES (pH 7.6), 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 0.1% Nonidet P-40). After centrifugation (10 min at 15,000 × g) to remove particulate material, the supernatant was incubated at 4 °C with antibodies (1:100) against anti-HSF1 or MKP1 with constant agitation. The immunocomplexes were precipitated with protein A-Sepharose (Sigma) and analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis using enhanced chemiluminescence detection (Amersham Biosciences). Reporter Assay—Cells were plated at about 8 × 104 cells per 35-mm dish and cultured for 24 h before transfection. After incubation, cells were transfected with 200 ng of β-galactosidase expression vector pSV110 and 200 ng of reporter gene, along with HSP25, inducible HSP70, and AP-1 expression vector. Cells were harvested 48 h later, luciferase activity was assayed, and results were normalized to the β-galactosidase expression (Promega). All the results represent the mean of three independent experiments. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay—Two complementary singlestrand DNA oligonucleotide, each 36 bases long and containing the HSE oligonucleotide, were annealed and used in the electrophoretic mobility shift DNA binding assay. The DAN sequences were 5′-GATCCTCGAAGGTTCGAGGATCCTCGAAGGTTCGAG-3′ and 3′-GAGCTTCCAAGCTCCTAGGAGCTTCCAAGCTCCTAG-5′. The HSE was labeled with [γ-32P]ATP using T4 polynucleotide kinase, and 5 μg of nuclear extract was incubated with the [32P]HSE at room temperature for 30 min. Sequentially the HSF1-HSE complex was separated from unbound HSE on 6% Tris-borate-EDTA gel. The gel was dried, and the autoradiogram was taken. Overexpression of HSP25 and HSP70i Facilitated Expressions of Endogenous HSPs Such as HSP25 and HSP70i in RIF Cells—When pcDNA3 vectors carrying Hsp25 or Hsp70i were transfected to RIF cells and stable cell lines were obtained, either HSP25 or HSP70i overexpressed cells were found to facilitate mutual expressions of the corresponding HSPs as well as their own protein expressions comparable with that of TR cells that are thermoresistant RIF cells, and showed high expressions of HSP25 and HSP70i (14Lee Y.J. Park G.H. Cho H.N. Cho C.K. Park Y.M. Lee S.J. Lee Y.S. Radiat. Res. 2002; 157: 371-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1A). We examined 2 or 3 clones and similar phenomena were obtained (supplemental Fig. 1). The reporter assay for Hsp25 and Hsp70i also indicated that the promoter activity for both Hsp25 and Hsp70i were significantly activated by HSP25 or HSP70i overexpression (Fig. 1B), suggesting that excess expressions of HSP25 and HSP70i increased promoter activity of both Hsp25 and Hsp70i. HSF1 Activation Was Observed in HSP25 or HSP70i Overexpressed Cells—Because HSF1 is known to bind to HSE to promote HSP transcription (3Wu C. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1995; 11: 441-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (982) Google Scholar), nuclear fractions were incubated with 32P-labeled HSE, and the HSF1-HSE complex was subjected to polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. As seen in Fig. 2A, the amount of HSF1-HSE complex was found to have significantly increased in both Hsp25- and Hsp70i-transfected cells. TR cells showed strong activation of HSF1, and stable transfection of Hsp25 or Hsp70i also showed increased HSF1 activation. Moreover, binding of HSF1-HSP70i in the cytosol of RIF cells was abundant, however, no binding activity was shown in NIH3T3 cells (supplemental Fig. 2). Reverse transcriptase-PCR analysis for HSF1 and HSF2 revealed that the amounts of these genes were not significantly different by HSP25 or HSP70i overexpression (Fig. 2B). However, a greater amount of HSF1 and HSF2 proteins was found in HSP25 or HSP70i overexpressed cells, suggesting post-translational regulation of HSF1 by HSP25 or HSP70i (Fig. 2C). Determination of the half-life of HSF1 also indicated that HSP25 or HSP70i overexpression increased HSF1 stability (Fig. 2D). Mutant Forms of Hsf1 Abolished the Enhanced Expression of HSPs by HSP25 or HSP70i—To examine whether HSF1 activation by ectopic expression of HSP25 or HSP70i was responsible for the increased expression of endogenous HSPs, C and N terminus deletion mutants of Hsf1 were transiently transfected to the stably transfected cells of Hsp25 or Hsp70i. Fig. 3A shows that increased promoter activity of both Hsp25 and Hsp70i was dramatically inhibited by additional transfection of deletion mutants of Hsf1. Western blot analysis also indicated that transient transfection of C terminus and N terminus deletion mutants of Hsf1 to either HSP25 or HSP70i overexpressed cells did not induce any endogenous HSP25 and HSP70i at all. As shown in Fig. 3B, overexpression of HSP25 and HSP70i facilitated endogenous expression of HSPs through HSF1 activation. To elucidate whether ectopic expression of HSP25 or HSP70i can affect endogenous expression of these proteins, transient transfection of HA-tagged Hsp25 was performed, and HSP25 protein expression was studied at 24, 48, and 72 h after transfection. As shown in Fig. 3C, ectopic expression of HA-tagged HSP25 was decreased at 48 h of transfection and could not be detected at 72 h, however, endogenous Hsp25 expression was increased from 48 h of transfection, which coincided with the decrease of extrinsic HSP25. Therefore, the results indicate that HSP25 or HSP70i affect expression of the corresponding endogenous HSPs through HSF1 activation. HSP25 and HSP70i Inhibited ERK1/2 Phosphorylation—Because ERK1/2 activity is involved in HSF1 phosphorylation and activation (21Chu B. Soncin F. Price B.D. Stevenson M.A. Calderwood S.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30847-30857Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar), the status of ERK1/2 phosphorylation was examined. Stable transfection of Hsp25 or Hsp70i inhibited ERK1/2 phosphorylation, and transient transfection of Erk1 to HSP25- or HSP70i-overexpressed cells abolished this increased expression of endogenous HSPs (Fig. 4A). When the reporter assay for Hsp25 or Hsp70i was performed, transient transfection of Erk1 inhibited promoter activities of Hsp25 or Hsp70i in HSP25- or HSP70i-overexpressed cells. However, inhibited transcriptional activity of AP-1 of one ERK1/2 downstream pathway in overexpressed cells of Hsp25 or HSP70i was restored or more augmented by Erk1 transfection (Fig. 4B). Therefore, the data strongly indicate that HSP25 or HSP70i overexpression induced dephosphorylation of ERK1/2, which might affect HSF1 phosphorylation. Serine Phosphorylation of HSF1 Was Reduced by HSP25 or HSP70i Transfection—Because ERK1/2 activity affects serine phosphorylation of HSF1 (21Chu B. Soncin F. Price B.D. Stevenson M.A. Calderwood S.K.

Serine phosphorylation of HSF1 disappeared in Hsp25- or Hsp70i-transfected RIF cells (Fig. 5A). Because ERK1/2 activation and consequent phosphorylation of serine 307 of HSF1 lead to inactivation of HSF1 (19Chu B. Zhong R. Soncin F. Stevenson M.A. Calderwood S.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18640-18646Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar), wild type or phosphorylation-deficient mutants of serine 307 (S307A) of Hsf1 were transiently transfected to stably overexpressed RIF cells of HSP25 or HSP70i. Expressions of HSP25 and HSP70i also disappeared in the transfectant of the S307D mutant, whereas transfectant of wild type Hsf1 and S307A expressed these proteins. Therefore, the results indicate that phosphorylation of HSF1 on serine 307 inactivated HSF1, and that HSP25 and HSP70i dephosphorylated HSF1 on serine 307 (Fig. 5B). To clarify whether down-regulation of ERK1/2 by HSP25 or HS70i is related to HSF1 phosphorylation, Erk1 was transiently transfected to HSP25 or HSP70i overexpressed cells. Fig. 5C shows that HSF1 phosphorylation was restored and expression of HSP25 or HSP70i was reduced by Erk1 transfection. In addition, S307A had a longer half-life than that of wild type Hsf1 and S307D when detected using HA-tagged mutants (Fig. 5D). Confocal microscopy also revealed that nuclear expression of HSF1 was more abundant in HSP25 or HSP70i overexpressed cells than that of RIF control cells. Moreover, HA-tagged Hsf1-S307A mutant as well as wild type Hsf1 were located in the nucleus, however, the majority of Hsf1-S307D mutant was not present in nucleus; Hsf1-S307D was present in the nuclear membrane and did not enter the nucleus (Fig. 5E). Therefore, these results indicate that HSP25 or HSP70i inhibited the nuclear translocation of HSF1 via decreased phosphorylation on serine 307, which in turn led to transcriptional activation of HSF1. Interaction between HSP25 or HSP70i and MKP1 Dephosphorylated ERK1/2—Because heat shock increased expressions of the phosphorylated form of MKP1, which was found to be associated with ERK1/2 and JNK1/2 inactivation (22Lee K.H. Lee C.T. Kim Y.W. Han S.K. Shin Y.S. Yoo C.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 13179-13186Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), we determined MKP1 phosphorylation in HSP25- or HSP70i-overexpressed cells. As seen in Fig. 6A, serine-phosphorylated MKP1 expression was increased in HSP25 or HSP70i overexpressed cells, and interaction between HSP25 or HSP70i and MKP1 was also increased. Transient transfection of site-directed mutants of Mkp1 on cysteine 258 to serine (Mkp1-C258S), which abolished phosphatase activity of MKP1 (23Sohaskey M.L. Ferrell Jr., J.E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 454-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), revealed that expressions of HSP25, HSP70i, and HSF1 were reduced by Mkp1-C258S transfection, and phosphorylations of both HSF1 and ERK1/2 by HSP25 or HSP70i were restored by this mutant (Fig. 6B), even though mutation of Mkp1 on cysteine 258 did not affect the binding activity with HSP25 or HSP70i (data not shown). The data indicate that the site of cysteine 258 on MKP1 is important for phosphorylation of ERK1/2. siRNA of HSP27 or HSP70i Treatment Inhibited HSF1 Expression— To unravel the physiological relevance of regulation existing between HSP27 or HSP70i and HSF1, HOS and NCI-H358 cells, which showed increased expressions of HSP27, HSP70i, as well as HSF1 (Fig. 7), were transfected with siRNA of HSP27 (siHSP27) or HSP70i (siHSP70i). Endogenous expression of HSPs as well as HSF1 expression was found to be dramatically inhibited in siHSP27 or siHSP70i-transfected HOS and NCI-H358 cells (Fig. 7). In addition, inhibited ERK1/2 phosphorylation was restored by these siRNAs, suggesting that HSP27 or HSP70i facilitated HSF1 activation by ERK1/2 dephosphorylation. HSPs are known as the molecular chaperone because of its major role in protein folding (24Parsell D.A. Lindquist S. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1993; 27: 437-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (1895) Google Scholar, 25Sarge K.D. Park-Sarge O.K. Kirby J.D. Mayo K.E. Morimoto R.I. Biol. Reprod. 1994; 50: 1334-1343Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 26Fink J.K. Hedera P. Semin. Neurol. 1999; 19: 301-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 27Chirico W.J. Waters M.G. Blobel G. Nature. 1988; 332: 805-810Crossref PubMed Scopus (840) Google Scholar). Because HSF1 induces Hsp70i and Hsp25 gene expression in response to heat stress, it has been suggested that HSPs may function in a negative feedback mechanism to return HSF1 to its inactive monomeric state (12Morimoto R.I. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3788-3796Crossref PubMed Scopus (1545) Google Scholar, 13Pirkkala L. Alastalo T.P. Zuo X. Benjamin I.J. Sistonen L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 2670-2675Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). However, in the present study, ectopic transfection of HSP25 or HSP70i in RIF cells increased the expression of endogenous HSPs, such as HSP25 and HSP70i, through activation of HSF1. NIH3T3 cells or L929 cells, which showed relatively low HSF1 expression did not exhibit such phenomena (supplemental Fig. 3). Therefore, when HSF1 expression was high, such as in RIF, HOS, and NCI-H358 cells, overexpression of HSP25 or HSP70i facilitated more expression of endogenous HSPs, which may result in more severe radio- or chemoresistance. Overexpression of HSP25 or HSP70i in RIF cells induced transcriptional activation of endogenous HSP25 and HSP70i, which was mediated by HSF1 activation (Figs. 1, 2, 3). Moreover, treatment of HOS and NCI-H358 cells, which showed high expression of HSF1 protein, with Hsp27 or Hsp70i siRNA inhibited endogenous expression of HSPs and HSF1 (Fig. 7), suggesting that HSP25 or HSP70i overexpression activated HSF1. A recent study, which derived a similar conclusion to ours, also suggested that cognate HSP70 was required for regulation of HSF1 during heat stress and subsequent target gene expression, and also showed greatly decreased HSF1 activation when transfected with siR-NAs targeted to cognate Hsp70 (28Ahn J.Y. Choi H. Kim Y.H. Han K.Y. Park J.S. Han S.S. Lee J. Nucleic Acids Res. 2005; 33: 3751-3762Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Upon activation, HSF1 undergoes several modifications such as trimerization and localization to specific nuclear structures. Independent of monomer to trimer transition, phosphorylation of HSF1 is strongly induced during heat shock. Although the bulk phophorylation level of HSF1 correlates well with its transcriptional activity, phosphorylation of Ser-303, Ser-307, and Ser-363 has been shown to repress the transactivation capacity of HSF1 (19Chu B.

Stevenson M.A. Calderwood S.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30847-30857Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). The result in the present study showed that HSP25 or HSP70i overexpression dephosphorylated HSF1 on serine 307 of HSF1 (Fig. 4). The phosphorylation mimicked mutant form of serine 307 inhibited expression of endogenous HSPs in HSP25 or HSP70i overexpressed cells, suggesting that HSP25 or HSP70i affected the phosphorylation status of HSF1, especially on serine 307. Moreover, the increased half-life and nuclear translocation of the dephophorylated mimicked mutant of serine 307 (Fig. 4) indicated that dephosphorylated HSF1 on serine 307 was the transcriptionally active form of HSF1. ERK1/2 phosphorylation was inhibited in Hsp25- or Hsp70i-transfected cells (Fig. 5) and ERK1/2 phosphorylation has been reported to be involved in HSF1 phosphorylation on serine 307 (16Mivechi N.F. Giaccia A.J. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 5512-5519PubMed Google Scholar, 21Chu B. Soncin F. Price B.D. Stevenson M.A. Calderwood S.K. J. Biol.

ERK1/2 was found to be overexpressed in Hsp25-or Hsp70i-transfected cells, and transcriptional activation of endogenous HSP25 or HSP70i was abolished, suggesting that HSP25 or HSP70i-mediated ERK1/2 down-regulation may be involved in dephosphorylation of HSF1 on serine 307. Phosphatase involved in ERK1/2 signaling is MKP1. MKP1 is a phosphatase with dual specificity, induced by various stresses, and inactivates ERKs (30Brondello J.M. Brunet A. Pouyssegur J. McKenzie F.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1368-1376Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). ERK1/2 phosphorylates serine 307 of HSF1 (31Xia W. Guo Y. Vilaboa N. Zuo J. Voellmy R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8749-8755Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). HSP70 has been shown to suppress ERK phosphorylation by direct interaction with MKP1 (32Yaglom J. O'Callaghan-Sunol C. Gabai V. Sherman M.Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 3813-3824Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). In the present study, ectopic expression of HSP25 or HSP70i increased MKP1 phosphorylation on the serine residue, resulting in increased binding activity with MKP1 and ERK1/2 dephosphorylation. Our results (Fig. 6) that HSP25 also bound MKP1 is a new finding, suggesting that HSP25 also has a potentiality of MKP1 activation. In addition, the phosphatase activity defective mutant of Mkp1 (MKP1-C258S) restored ERK1/2 phosphorylation and HSF1 expression, suggesting that interaction of MKP1 with HSP25 or HSP70i activated MKP1 phosphorylation, which was correlated with ERK1/2 dephosphorylation. Based on the data obtained, we suggest that overexpression of HSP25 or HSP70i activates HSF1, which is mediated by interaction with MKP1. Interaction of MKP1 with HSP25 or HSP70i activates MKP1 phosphorylation and then ERK1/2 inactivation, resulting in HSF1 dephosphorylation on serine 307. Because HSF1 dephosphorylation facilitated translocation of HSF1 to the nucleus (Fig. 4) (3Wu C. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1995; 11: 441-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (982) Google Scholar, 12Morimoto R.I. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3788-3796Crossref PubMed Scopus (1545) Google Scholar, 33Morimoto R.I. Santoro M.G. Nat. Biotechnol. 1998; 16: 833-838Crossref PubMed Scopus (524) Google Scholar), it is highly likely that this activated HSF1 enhanced more expression of endogenous HSPs such as HSP25 and HSP70i. In conclusion, the present data suggest the possibility that overexpression of HSPs does not always show feedback inhibition of HSF1. In certain cancer cells that have HSF1 excessively expressed, overexpression of HSPs facilitated more endogenous HSPs production through HSF1 activation. Download .pdf (.2 MB) Help with pdf files"

The familial epilepsy γ2(K289M) mutation affects a basic residue conserved in the TM2–3 linker of most GABAA subunits. We investigated the effect on expression and function of the Lys → Met mutation in mouse α1(K278M), β2(K274M), and γ2(K289M) subunits. Compared with cells expressing wild-type and α1β2γ2(K289M) receptors, cells expressing α1(K278M)β2γ2 and α1β2(K274M)γ2 receptors exhibited reduced agonist-evoked current density and reduced GABA potency, with no change in single channel conductance. The low current density of α1β2(K274M)γ2 receptors coincided with reduced surface expression. By contrast the surface expression of α1(K278M)β2γ2 receptors was similar to wild-type and α1β2γ2(K289M) receptors suggesting that the α1(K278M) impairs function. In keeping with this interpretation GABA-activated channels mediated by α1(K278M)β2γ2 receptors had brief open times. To a lesser extent γ2(K289M) also reduced mean open time, whereas β2(K274M) had no effect. We used propofol as an alternative GABAA receptor agonist to test whether the functional deficits of mutant subunits were specific to GABA activation. Propofol was less potent as an activator of α1(K278M)β2γ2 receptors. By contrast, neither β2(K274M) nor γ2(K289M) affected the potency of propofol. The β2(K274M) construct was unique in that it reduced the efficacy of propofol activation relative to GABA. These data suggest that the α1 subunit Lys-278 residue plays a pivotal role in channel gating that is not dependent on occupancy of the GABA binding site. Moreover, the conserved TM2–3 loop lysine has an asymmetric function in different GABAA subunits.

Baulac and colleagues (5Baulac S. Huberfeld G. Gourfinkel-An I. Mitropoulou G. Beranger A. Prud'homme J.F. Baulac M. Brice A. Bruzzone R. LeGuern E. Nat. Genet. 2001; 28: 46-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (708) Google Scholar) reported reduced current amplitude when compared with wild-type receptors upon expression of α1β2γ2(K289M) receptors in Xenopus oocytes. By contrast, Bianchi and colleagues (14Bianchi M.T. Song L. Zhang H. Macdonald R.L. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 5321-5327Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) described faster GABA-evoked current deactivation without altered α1β3γ2(K289M)-mediated peak current or activation rate when compared with wild-type receptors expressed in human embryonic kidney (HEK293) cells. Using the same cells, examining the rate of current activation following laser initiated release of caged GABA onto α1β2γ2(K289M) and wild-type receptors, Ramakrishnan and Hess (28Ramakrishnan L. Hess G.P. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 7534-7540Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) concluded that the mutation reduced current activation rate. Homology modeling of the α1β2γ2 receptor onto the structural model of the Torpedo marmorata nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (29Miyazawa A. Fujiyoshi Y. Unwin N. Nature. 2003; 423: 949-955Crossref PubMed Scopus (1082) Google Scholar) revealed an additional possibility: that the K289M mutation may reduce single channel conductance (30O'Mara M. Cromer B. Chung Parker M.S.H. Biophys. J. 2005; 88: 3286-3299Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The TM2–3 region may participate in the transduction of GABA binding to channel gating by coming into close proximity with N-terminal residues. Indeed an electrostatic interaction between the lysine residue on the α1 subunit and acidic residues in loops 2 and 7 may be responsible for intramolecular transduction, coupling GABA binding to channel opening (23Kash T.L. Jenkins A. Kelley J.C. Trudell J.R. Harrison N.L. Nature. 2003; 421: 272-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). To address the role of Lys-289 and equivalent lysine residues in the most common (α1β2γ2) GABAA receptor, we explored the effects of α1(K278M), β2(K274M), or γ2L(K289M) on receptor-surface expression and function. Each of the subunits exhibited distinct phenotypes when mutated, indicating an important but asymmetric contribution of this site to GABAA receptor function. Cell Culture and Transfection—COS7 cells (ATCC CRL 1651) and HEK293 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mm glutamine, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 100 units/ml penicillin in an atmosphere of 5% CO2. Exponentially growing cells were transfected by electroporation (400 V, infinity resistance, 125 mF, Bio-Rad Gene Electropulser II) in the case of COS7 cells and calcium phosphate precipitation, in the case of HEK293 cells (17Hales T.G. Tang H. Bollan K. Johnson S. King D. Connolly C.N. Mol. Cell Neurosci. 2005; 29: 120-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Cells were transfected with equimolar ratios of GABAA subunit cDNAs. Cells were analyzed 12–18 h and 24–96 h after transfection for biochemical and electrophysiological experiments, respectively. DNA Constructions—Murine α1, β2, and γ2L subunit cDNAs containing the myc or FLAG tag (between amino acids 4 and 5 of the mature polypeptide) have been described previously (31Connolly C.N. Krishek B.J. McDonald B.J. Smart Moss T. G.S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 89-96Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar) and shown to be functionally silent with respect to receptor pharmacology and physiology. The mutant expression constructs α1(K278M)Myc, β2(K274M)Myc and γ2L(K289M)Myc were generated by PCR. The fidelity of the final expression constructs was verified by DNA sequencing. Antibodies—The 9E10 antibody was obtained from 9E10 hybridoma cells (32Evan G.I. Lewis G. Ramsay G. Bishop J.M. Mol. Cell Biol. 1985; 5: 3610-3616Crossref PubMed Scopus (2167) Google Scholar) and used directly as supernatant without purification. Antibodies to the FLAG epitope were purchased from Sigma. The secondary antibodies, goat anti-mouse Alexa Fluor 568 and goat anti-mouse Alexa Fluor 488, were purchased from Molecular Probes (UK), and goat anti-mouse horseradish peroxidase from Amersham Biosciences. Immunofluorescence—COS7 cells were fixed in 3% paraformaldehyde (in PBS) and washed twice in 50 mm NH4Cl (in PBS) and blocked (10% fetal bovine serum, 0.5% bovine serum albumin in PBS) for 30 min. Subsequent washes and antibody dilutions were performed in PBS containing 10% fetal bovine serum and 0.5% bovine serum albumin. Following surface labeling, cells were permeabilized by the addition of 0.5% Triton X-100 (10 min), and the immunofluorescence protocol was repeated from the NH4Cl step. Cells were examined using a wide-field imaging system (Improvision). Quantification of Cell-Surface Expression—COS7 cells were plated into 96-well dishes. Eight transfections were used per dish (12 wells per transfection, with nine determinants for each condition). Cells were fixed in 3% paraformaldehyde (in PBS). Cell-surface detection was performed in the absence of detergent, and total expression levels were determined following Triton X-100 (0.5%, 15 min) treatment. Cells were washed twice in 50 mm NH4Cl (in PBS) and blocked (10% fetal bovine serum, 0.5% bovine serum albumin in PBS) for 1 h. Subsequent washes were performed in block. Receptor expression was determined using an horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody and assayed using 3,3′,5,5′-tetramethylenebenzidine (Sigma) as the substrate, with detection at 450 nm after 30 min, following the addition of 0.5 m H2SO4. The reaction rate was determined to remain linear for up to 1 h. Electrophysiology—The whole cell patch clamp technique was used to record GABA-activated currents from HEK293 cells voltage-clamped at –60 mV. GABA (100 μm) was applied by local pressure ejection from low resistance micropipettes (33Adodra S. Hales T.G. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1995; 115: 953-960Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). In experiments investigating the modulation of GABA-evoked currents by bath applied flunitrazepam, GABA was applied for 1 s at ∼EC10 concentrations. Data for concentration-response relationships were recorded by applying GABA or propofol for 4 s. The recording chamber was continuously perfused (5 ml/min) with an extracellular solution comprised of (in mm) NaCl, 140; KCl, 4.7; MgCl2, 1.2; CaCl2, 2.5; glucose, 10; and HEPES-NaOH, 10 (pH 7.4). The electrode solution contained (in mm): CsCl, 140; MgCl2, 2.0; EGTA, 11; ATP (Mg2+ salt) 3; and HEPES-CsOH, 10 (pH 7.4). Junction potentials were nulled with an open electrode in the recording chamber prior to each experiment. The liquid junction potential was trivial (∼2 mV), and its inappropriate compensation was ignored. Experiments were performed at room temperature (20–24 °C). Macroscopic GABA-evoked currents were monitored by an Axopatch-200B amplifier, low pass filtered with a cut-off frequency of 2 KHz, and then recorded and digitized using a Digidata 1320A interface (Axon Instruments, Union City, CA) for acquisition at 10 kHz onto the hard drive of a personal computer. Currents were averaged and measured using pCLAMP 8.0 software (Axon Instruments). Single Channel Recording—Single channel currents recorded from cell-attached and outside-out patches were low-pass filtered at 2 and 1 KHz, respectively (digitized at 10 KHz). Data were acquired as described previously (34Davies P.A. Kirkness E.F. Hales T.G. J. Physiol. 2001; 537: 101-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). GABA was either applied to outside-out patches at 1 μm or 1 mm; there was no significant difference in the observed single channel conductances. GABA (1 mm) was applied to cell-attached patches through the recording electrode, which contained extracellular solution. Patches were voltage-clamped using electrode potentials provided in the figure legends. Sections of digitized data in which unitary events predominated were selected for analysis and were leak subtracted using Clampfit for the creation of all-points amplitude histograms and event lists using Fetchan (pCLAMP 8.0, Axon Instruments). Analysis of Whole Cell Data—Graphs of GABA concentration-response relationships were fitted using the Hill equation as described previously (33Adodra S. Hales T.G. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1995; 115: 953-960Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). For fitting propofol concentration-response relationships (normalized to maximum GABA-evoked current) the Hill equation was modified as in Equation 1. IPropIGMax=IPMax{1+[EC50[Prop]]H}−1(Eq. 1) In this equation the whole cell current amplitude activated by propofol (IProp) is normalized to that activated by 10 mm GABA (IGMax). IPMax is the maximum amplitude of the propofol activated current relative to IGMax. EC50 is the concentration of propofol required to activate half of the maximum IProp, and H is the slope factor of the concentration-response relationship. Current density measurements were calculated from each cell by dividing the peak GABA- or propofol-activated current amplitude (measured in picoamps (pA)) by the cell's capacitance (measured in picofarads (pF)). Analysis of Single Channel Data—All-points amplitude histograms for single channel recordings were fitted with multiple Gaussians (least squares minimization) to amplitude histograms using the Simplex method within pSTAT (pCLAMP 8.0). The amplitude of the single channel current recorded from each patch was determined from the difference between the mean current amplitudes determined from the Gaussians fitted to the closed- and unitary open-state currents. Single channel conductances are reported as the chord conductance derived as γ = i/(Vm–Erev), where i is unitary current amplitude, Vm is the holding potential, and Erev is the mean reversal potential of GABA-evoked single channels derived from linear fits to current-voltage relationships. In several outside-out patch recordings two unitary conductances were evident. Our analysis of single channels was restricted to the main state. To quantify channel open times event lists were generated from single channel data obtained from cell-attached patches. Fetchan (pCLAMP 8.0) was used to create event lists of unitary events recorded from cell-attached patches using the 50% threshold detection method (35Colquhoun D. Sigworth F.J. Single Channel Recording. 1983; (Plenum Press, New York): 191-263Crossref Google Scholar), having determined baseline and open current amplitudes from all points amplitude histograms. Event lists were analyzed using pSTAT yielding values of mean channel open time. Event lists were also pooled from multiple patches to obtain a representative sample of events (≥4 patches). All such data were included in the open time histogram (10 bins per decade) plotted with a square root ordinate and logarithmic abscissa (36Sigworth F.J. Sine S.M. Biophys. J. 1987; 52: 1047-1054Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (649) Google Scholar). The maximum likelihood method was used to fit the sum of three exponentials to open time histograms (pSTAT), omitting those events from the fit that were briefer than 0.15 ms that were compromised by the system dead-time (37Haas K.F. Macdonald R.J. J. Physiol. 1999; 514: 27-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). Statistics—All data are expressed as the arithmetic mean ± S.E. Unless otherwise stated, statistical analysis involved analysis of variance (ANOVA) with the posthoc Tukey's test. Conservation of a TM2–3 Loop Lysine between GABAA and Glycine Receptor Subunits—A comparison of the primary sequence of GABAA receptor α, β, and γ subunits within the extracellular loop, between the transmembrane domains TM2–3, reveals a high level of conservation between subunits of the same class (Fig. 1). A consensus sequence R-LPK-Y exists between all αβγ subunits, with the proline residue being conserved in all members of the Cys-loop receptor superfamily, including receptors for acetylcholine, 5-hydroxytryptamine, and glycine. Interestingly, the lysine (Lys-289) residue, associated with epilepsy when mutated in the γ2 subunit (5Baulac S. Huberfeld G. Gourfinkel-An I. Mitropoulou G. Beranger A. Prud'homme J.F. Baulac M. Brice A. Bruzzone R. LeGuern E. Nat. Genet. 2001; 28: 46-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (708) Google Scholar), is conserved in α and β subunits (Arg in γ3, δ, and ϵ, Asn in π, and His in θ) as well as in glycine receptors, where it has been implicated in hyperekplexia (19Elmslie F. V. Hutchings S.M. Spencer V. Curtis A. Gardiner R. M. Covanis T.Rees M. J. Med. Genet. 1996; 33: 435-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Intriguingly, this lysine residue present in the α1 (Lys-278) and β2 (Lys-274) subunits has been implicated in the gating of GABAA receptors and may play a conserved and essential role in all subunits in receptor function (23Kash T.L. Jenkins A. Kelley J.C. Trudell J.R. Harrison N.L. Nature. 2003; 421: 272-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar, 24Kash T.L. Dizon M.J. Trudell J.R. Harrison N.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 4887-4893Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). We undertook, therefore, to examine the effect of the mutation in α1(K278M), β2(K274M), and γ2L(K289M) subunits. The Role of Lysine at the Homologous Position in the α1 Subunit on Transport to the Cell Surface—To determine, qualitatively, the ability of the α1(K278M) subunit to access the cell surface, we examined its cellular distribution when expressed in COS7 cells. COS7 cells were used in these studies due to their clear definition of intracellular compartments (38Bollan K. King D. Robertson L.A. Brown K. Taylor P.M. Moss S.J. Connolly C.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 4747-4755Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The existence of surface receptors was determined in the absence of detergent using anti-Myc antibodies and Alexa Fluor 488 secondary antibodies. Following permeabilization, cells were re-probed as above, using Alexa Fluor 568 secondary antibodies. As observed previously for wild-type α1Myc (31Connolly C.N. Krishek B.J. McDonald B.J. Smart Moss T. G.S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 89-96Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar), the α1(K278M)Myc subunit could not access the cell surface when expressed alone (data not shown). When α1Myc was co-expressed with the β2 subunit, there was robust cell-surface staining (Fig. 2A, upper right panel). Likewise, the co-expression of α1(K278M)Myc with the β2 subunit produced robust cell-surface labeling (Fig. 2A, α*β, lower right panel) as well as strong intracellular labeling. Identical results were observed when α1(K278M)Myc was co-expressed with β2 and γ2LFLAG subunits and immunofluorescence was performed via the FLAG epitope on the γ2L subunit (Fig. 2B). Because the γ2L subunit cannot access the surface in the absence of either the α1 or β2 subunits (31Connolly C.N. Krishek B.J. McDonald B.J. Smart Moss T. G.S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 89-96Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar), its surface expression is a faithful indicator of the presence of α1β2γ2L receptors. From hereafter 'γ2′ refers to the γ2L subunit, which was used throughout this study. To quantify our observations, we used the cell ELISA technique to compare surface and total expression levels. Cell-surface expression (in the absence of detergent) of the α1(K278M)Myc is presented as a percentage of total (in the presence of detergent) levels and normalized to wild-type controls (α1Myc) performed in parallel. Using this approach (Fig. 2C), the cell-surface level for α1(K278M)Mycβ2 receptors was 66 ± 11%, compared with the normalized wild-type α1Mycβ2 receptor level of 100 ± 11%. Similarly, the cell-surface level for α1(K278M)Mycβ2γ2FLAG receptors was determined (via FLAG epitope) to be 87 ± 34%, compared with the normalized wild-type α1Mycβ2γ2FLAG receptors at 100 ± 13%. Thus, the presence of K278M in the α1 subunit does not have a major impact on biogenesis or the surface transport of α1(K278M)β2γ2 receptors. The Role of Lysine at the Homologous Position in the β2 Subunit on Transport to the Cell Surface—To determine, qualitatively, the ability of the β2(K274M) subunit to access the cell surface, we examined its cellular distribution when expressed in COS7 cells. As observed previously for wild-type β2Myc (31Connolly C.N. Krishek B.J. McDonald B.J. Smart Moss T. G.S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 89-96Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar), the β2(K274M)Myc subunit could not access the cell surface when expressed alone (data not shown). When β2Myc was co-expressed with the α1 subunit, there was robust cell-surface staining (Fig. 3A, upper right panel). In contrast, when β2(K274M)Myc was co-expressed with the α1 subunit there was no cell-surface labeling (Fig. 3A, αβ*; lower right panel). Instead, strong intracellular labeling within the endoplasmic reticulum was observed, as evidenced by the characteristic reticular pattern, typically observed in"
https://openalex.org/W1971085008,"The transporter associated with antigen processing (TAP) is essential for the delivery of antigenic peptides from the cytosol into the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), where they are loaded onto major histocompatibility complex class I molecules. TAP is a heterodimeric transmembrane protein that comprises the homologous subunits TAP1 and TAP2. As for many other oligomeric protein complexes, which are synthesized in the ER, the process of subunit assembly is essential for TAP to attain a native functional state. Here, we have analyzed the individual requirements of TAP1 and TAP2 for the formation of a functional TAP complex. Unlike TAP1, TAP2 is very unstable when expressed in isolation. We show that heterodimerization of TAP subunits is required for maintaining a stable level of TAP2. By using an in vitro expression system we demonstrate that the biogenesis of functional TAP depends on the assembly of preexisting TAP1 with newly synthesized TAP2, but not vice versa. The pore forming core transmembrane domain (core TMD) of in vitro expressed TAP2 is necessary and sufficient to allow functional complex formation with pre-existing TAP1. We propose that the observed assembly mechanism of TAP protects newly synthesized TAP2 from rapid degradation and controls the number of transport active transporter molecules. Our findings open up new possibilities to investigate functional and structural properties of TAP and provide a powerful model system to address the biosynthetic assembly of oligomeric transmembrane proteins in the ER.

The antigen processing machinery plays an important role in the cellular immune response of vertebrates for the identification of infected or malignantly transformed cells. Peptides derived from proteasomal degradation of intracellular proteins are translocated via the transporter associated with antigen processing (TAP) 3The abbreviations used are: TAP, transporter associated with antigen processing; ABC, ATP-binding cassette; ALLN, N-acetyl-leucyl-leucyl-norleucinal; NBD, nucleotide-binding domain; TM, transmembrane; TMD, transmembrane domain; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; EGS, ethylene glycol bissuccinimidyl succinate; ConA, concanavalin A; CFTR, cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator; MDR1, multidrug resistance protein 1. into the ER lumen and loaded onto major histocompatibility complex class I molecules (1Lankat-Buttgereit B. Tampé R. FEBS Lett. 1999; 464: 108-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Presentation of “nonself” peptides at the cell surface to cytotoxic T-cells triggers the elimination of the infected or transformed cell. Lack of TAP expression e.g. in tumor tissue is associated with a dramatic loss of surface major histocompatibility complex class I and consequently promotes strongly the evasion of malignant cells from a proper cellular immune response (2Ritz U. Seliger B. Mol. Med. 2001; 7: 149-158Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter TAP is a heterodimer that comprises the two homologous subunits, TAP1 and TAP2, each of which consists of a hydrophobic transmembrane domain (TMD) and a hydrophilic, highly conserved cytoplasmic nucleotide-binding domain (NBD). The TMDs of both TAP subunits contribute to the formation of the peptide-binding site and the translocation pore (1Lankat-Buttgereit B. Tampé R. FEBS Lett. 1999; 464: 108-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The binding and hydrolysis of ATP is believed to power the transport process by inducing conformational changes in the NBDs. These structural changes alter the conformation of the TMDs and cause the binding and movement of peptides across the ER membrane. The TMDs of TAP1 and TAP2 have unique N-terminal domains (N-domains with three to four TM segments) in addition to six core TM segments common to most ABC transporters (1Lankat-Buttgereit B. Tampé R. FEBS Lett. 1999; 464: 108-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Like TAP, many other proteins that are synthesized in the ER have oligomeric structures. The subunits of these protein complexes are translated independently of each other and are inserted into the membrane and/or lumen of the ER during their synthesis (3Trombetta E.S. Parodi A.J. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2003; 19: 649-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar). The assembly of multisubunit complexes in the ER seems to be a carefully regulated process and oligomerization is thought to induce structural changes in the subunits that are necessary for the protein to attain its native and functional state (3Trombetta E.S. Parodi A.J. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2003; 19: 649-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar). Once correctly assembled, soluble or membrane-bound protein complexes achieve structural stability and escape the ER quality control mechanisms (3Trombetta E.S. Parodi A.J. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2003; 19: 649-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar). However, unassembled orphan subunits that do not obtain their proper quaternary structure are removed from the cells by the proteasome-mediated ER-associated degradation pathway (4Bonifacino J.S. Weissman A.M. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1998; 14: 19-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (536) Google Scholar). Although it is clear that proper subunit assembly in the ER controls expression level, intracellular localization and function of oligomeric proteins, little is known about the requirements of transmembrane proteins for the formation of functional oligomers. Here, we investigated this by analyzing the heterodimeric assembly of TAP in the ER membrane. We demonstrate that the stability of the individual TAP subunits in vivo differs markedly and that maintenance of TAP2 expression requires the formation of a complex with TAP1. TAP2 chains expressed in isolation are degraded within minutes by a proteasome-dependent pathway, whereas TAP1 chains as well as assembled TAP molecules are highly stable in vivo. By using a cell-free transcription/translation system we show for the first time that the functional biogenesis of TAP requires the assembly of pre-existing TAP1 with newly synthesized TAP2 but not vice versa. Furthermore, in support of our previous findings in intact cells (5Leonhardt R.M. Keusekotten K. Bekpen C. Knittler M.R. J. Immunol. 2005; 174: 5104-5114Crossref Scopus (49) Google Scholar), we demonstrate that the pore forming core TMD of newly synthesized TAP2 containing TM segments 4–9 is necessary and sufficient to allow functional assembly with fully synthesized TAP1. Based on our present findings we propose a biosynthetic assembly pathway for TAP in the ER in which pre-existing stable TAP1 polypeptides protect newly synthesized TAP2 chains from rapid intracellular degradation. Thereby they act as a structural platform that directly controls the biogenesis and level of functional transporter complexes. The findings of our studies have significant implications for understanding the early events in the antigen presentation pathway and the assembly of polytopic membrane proteins in the ER.

The complementary primers (Invitrogen) 5′-GCCGCAGACCCCACCATGGCGCCCGGCACCCTGCGACTTGG-3′ and 5′-CCAAGTCGCAGGGTGCCGGGCGCCATGGTGGGGTCGTCTGCGGC-3′ (TAP2ΔTM1 (2–42)), 5′-GCCGCAGACCCCACCATGGCGCCCACCATGAGCACC-3′ and 5′-GGTGCTCATGGTGGGCGCCATGGTGGGGTCTGCGGC-3′ (TAP2ΔTM2 (2–88)), 5′-CGCAGACCCCACCATGGCGCCCGGGCAGG-3′ and 5′-CCTGCCCGGGCGCCATGGTGGGGTCTGCG-3′ (TAP2ΔTM3 (2–128)), 5′-CGCAGACCCCACCATGGCGCCAGACGCCTTTGCG-3′ and 5′-CGCAAAGGCGTCTGGCGCCATGGTGGGGTCTGCG-3′ (TAP2ΔTM4 (2–185)), 5′-CGCAGACCCCACCATGGCGCCCCAGGAGACCAAGACAGGG-3′ and 5′-CCCTGTCTTGGTCTCCTGGGGCGCCATGGTGGGGTCTGCG-3′ (TAP2ΔTM5 (2–241)) were used to generate the different N-terminally truncated TAP variants. All pSP64-TAP2ΔTM constructs were fully sequenced in both directions. Pulse-Chase Analysis, Chemical Cross-linking, Immunoprecipitation, and Western Blotting—For pulse-chase analysis methionine- and cysteine-starved cells were labeled with 500 μCi of Promix 35S label (Amersham Biosciences) for 60 min in the presence or absence of 250 μm proteasome inhibitor ALLN (N-acetyl-leucyl-leucyl-norleucinal, Calbiochem) before lysis in TBS, 1% Triton X-100 either immediately or upon incubation in IMDM chase medium for different time points. For chemical cross-linking of TAP, T2 transfectants (106 cells of T2(TAP1) and 4 × 106 cells of T2(TAP2)) were lysed in PBS containing 1% digitonin and 3 mm ethylene glycol bissuccinimidyl succinate (EGS; Pierce). After incubation for 30 min at 4 °C, the lysates were analyzed in Western blots probed for TAP1 and TAP2. Immunoprecipitations and Western blotting were performed as described previously (10Ehses S. Leonhardt R.M. Hansen G. Knittler M.R. J. Immunol. 2005; 174: 328-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Preparation and Purification of Microsomes—Microsomes from 2 × 108 T2 cells were generated by sucrose gradient fractionation as described previously (10Ehses S. Leonhardt R.M. Hansen G. Knittler M.R. J. Immunol. 2005; 174: 328-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). To strip the microsomes off their bound ribosomes, 400 μl of the microsomal suspension (concentration of 0.4 equivalent/μl corresponding to A280 = 20) were incubated with 4 ml of high salt buffer (50 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 250 mm sucrose, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 m KCl, and protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science)) and then centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. The resulting membrane pellets were resuspended in 1 ml of high salt buffer and centrifuged again. Afterward, the microsomes were resuspended at a concentration of 1 equivalent/μl (corresponding to A280 = 50) in 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 250 mm sucrose, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and protease inhibitor mixture. Finally, aliquots of 20 μl were snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at –80 °C. In Vitro Expression of TAP1 and TAP2—For the in vitro transcription/translation of TAP1 and TAP2 we used the TNT SP6 quick coupled transcription/translation system (Promega). Microsomes (20 equivalents) and 1 μg of plasmid-DNA were preincubated with 0.5 μl of RNasin inhibitor (40 units/μl) for 30 min on ice. Subsequently, 40 μl of the TNT quick master mix were mixed with 0.2–0.25 μg of plasmid DNA, microsomes (0.6–1.2 equivalents), and 2 μl of diethylpyrocarbonate-water. The reaction mix was then incubated in the presence of 80 μm methionine at 30 °C for 90 min. Finally, the microsomal fractions were collected by centrifugation (100,000 × g) and washed once with PBS. Immunodepletion Assay—After in vitro expression of TAP1 and/or TAP2 chains the microsomal membranes were washed with PBS and lysed for 30 min in 100 μl of ice-cold PBS, 1% digitonin. Subsequently, in vitro expressed or pre-existing TAP subunits were quantitatively removed from the lysates by two successive rounds of immunodepletion with protein A-Sepharose conjugated anti-TAP1 or anti-TAP2 antibodies. To control the specificity of immunodepletion and co-depletion of TAP chains, microsomal lysates were incubated with free protein A-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) in parallel. Finally, the lysates were analyzed in Western blots probed for TAP1 and TAP2. Peptide Transport Assay—TAP subunits were synthesized in vitro in the presence of microsomes (3 equivalents) and 24 μm model peptide S8, which was biotin-labeled at the lysine residue (TVDNKTRYR), at 30 °C for 60 min. In control experiments microsomes from T2 and T2(TAPwt) cells were incubated in the same way but without additional expression of TAP chains in vitro. Microsomes were isolated and washed as described above. Following lysis with 20 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 500 mm NaCl, 1 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MnCl2, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 0.1% Triton X-100 (Sigma), protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science), transported glycosylated S8-biotin peptides were isolated by a 1-h incubation with ConA-Sepharose (Pharmacia) at room temperature. After extensive washing with lysis buffer, NeutrAvidin-alkaline phosphatase (Pierce) was applied to the peptides in 10 mm Tris/HCl, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm ZnCl2, 0.1 mm MgCl2, pH 7.0, for 30 min at 4 °C. The ConA-Sepharose beads were extensively washed with incubation buffer and incubated with a p-nitrophenyl phosphate-containing substrate solution (Sigma). After 40-min incubation at room temperature the reaction was stopped with 300 mm NaOH. To determine the quantity of transported S8 peptides, the substrate solution was separated from the ConA-Sepharose by centrifugation and the amount of p-nitrophenol resulting from the alkaline phosphatase-catalyzed hydrolysis was measured by spectrometer at a wavelength of 400 nm. Newly Synthesized TAP2 Is Rescued from Rapid Proteasome-dependent Degradation by Assembly with Stable TAP1—To get insight into the biogenesis of TAP in the ER we first analyzed the in vivo stability of rat TAP1 and rat TAP2 in human T2 cells, which lack expression of endogenous TAP, by pulse-chase experiments in the presence or absence of the proteasome inhibitor ALLN (Fig. 1, A and B). The transporter subunits were expressed either individually or in combination. In the T2 transfectant expressing both transporter subunits (T2(TAPwt)) we observed no significant degradation of TAP chains during the chase period of 240 min (Fig. 1A). A similar observation was made for T2 cells expressing solely TAP1 (T2(TAP1)). In contrast, pulse-chase experiments with cells expressing only TAP2 (T2(TAP2)) show that in isolation TAP2 chains are rapidly degraded with a half-life of about 30–50 min (Fig. 1A). The observation that TAP2 degradation could be almost completely blocked by the proteasome inhibitor ALLN (Fig. 1B) indicates that the catalytic activity of the proteasome is involved in this cellular process. Studies with mutant TAP variants (11Daumke O. Knittler M.R. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 4776-4786Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) and biochemical cross-linking experiments using EGS (Ref. 12Antoniou A.N. Ford S. Pilley E.S. Blake N. Powis S.J. Immunology. 2002; 106: 182-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar and Fig. 2A) demonstrate that TAP2, unlike TAP1, has the ability to form homodimeric complexes in intact cells. Interestingly, as can be seen from the pulse-chase analysis in Fig. 2B, the population of TAP2 homodimers in T2(TAP2) is subject to rapid intracellular degradation. This suggests that, in contrast to the heterodimeric assembly of TAP, the homodimerization of TAP2 does not confer high in vivo stability. Taken together, our findings demonstrate that the in vivo stability of the individual TAP subunits differs markedly and that the maintenance of TAP2 expression requires the interaction with long-lived TAP1 subunits. Pre-existing TAP1 Assembles with Newly Synthesized TAP2 but Not Vice Versa—The experiments above show that the rescue of newly synthesized TAP2 chains depends on the formation of heterodimeric TAP complexes in the ER. Therefore, we were interested to find out what kind of mechanism is involved in the assembly of the TAP heterodimer. To investigate this and to separate experimentally the process of TAP complex formation from subunit degradation, we established a cell-free in vitro transcription/translation system for the expression of TAP chains in which we used purified microsomes derived from TAP-deficient T2 cells or T2 transfectants T2(TAP1) or T2(TAP2) (11Daumke O. Knittler M.R. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 4776-4786Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) expressing the individual TAP1 and TAP2 subunits (Fig. 3A, lanes 1–3). Three different conditions for association of wild-type TAP were analyzed in our in vitro assays. In the first experiment, we expressed both TAP chains in vitro in the presence of microsomes derived from non-transfected T2 cells (Fig. 3A, lane 4). In the second and third experiment, TAP2 or TAP1 (Fig. 3A, lanes 5 and 6) was synthesized in vitro in the presence of microsomes prepared from T2(TAP1) or T2(TAP2), respectively. Under all experimental conditions efficient incorporation of in vitro expressed TAP chains into purified microsomes was observed (Fig. 3A). To analyze whether the formation of the TAP complex requires the assembly of newly synthesized subunits or the interaction between newly synthesized and pre-existing chains, we performed immunoprecipitation experiments from detergent-lysed microsomes that were derived from the in vitro transcription/translation experiments. As can be seen from Fig. 3B, anti-TAP2 immunoprecipitation showed co-isolation of TAP1 when both TAP chains were expressed in vitro at the same time in the presence of purified T2 microsomes. Interestingly, stable complex formation of the transporter could be also observed when TAP2 was translated in vitro in the presence of microsomes from T2(TAP1), whereas no heterodimerization of TAP was detected when TAP1 was expressed in vitro in the presence of microsomes from T2(TAP2). This suggests that TAP assembly requires newly synthesized TAP2 but not TAP1. To validate these findings and to determine the efficiencies of complex formation, we performed immunodepletion experiments with microsomal lysates from T2, T2(TAP1), and T2(TAP2) after expression of TAP1 and/or TAP2 in vitro. For these studies we used anti-TAP antisera that specifically remove TAP1 or TAP2 chains from detergent-lysed microsomes (Fig. 4A). Fig. 4B shows that immunodepletion of TAP2 from T2(TAPwt)-derived microsomes is accompanied by a complete co-depletion of TAP1 (Fig. 4B) demonstrating highly efficient assembly of TAP chains in vivo. Although the amounts of TAP1 and TAP2 were comparable with that present in the T2(TAPwt) microsomes, immunodepletion showed a less-efficient assembly of TAP (≥50% reduction of complex formation) in T2-derived microsomes after simultaneous in vitro expression of both TAP subunits (Fig. 4B). This suggests that under these conditions only a part of the TAP1 and/or TAP2 population was in an assembly-competent conformation. In contrast, we observed the same efficient and quantitative heterodimerization of TAP1 and TAP2 as in T2(TAPwt) microsomes for microsomes prepared from T2(TAP1) after in vitro expression of TAP2 (Fig. 4B). Furthermore, as expected from our experiments above (Fig. 3B), no detectable complex formation could be seen for microsomes derived from T2(TAP2) after in vitro expression of TAP1 (Fig. 4B). In conclusion, our findings demonstrate that TAP1 and TAP2 differ in their structural and temporal requirements for heterodimeric complex formation. We propose that efficient heterodimerization of TAP molecules in the ER requires the interaction of pre-existing TAP1 with newly synthesized TAP2. Newly Synthesized TAP2 Requires an Intact Core TMD for Stable and Functional Complex Formation with Pre-existing TAP1—It has been previously shown that the six TM segments of the core TMD of TAP2 are sufficient for the functional heterodimeric assembly with TAP1 in intact cells (5Leonhardt R.M. Keusekotten K. Bekpen C. Knittler M.R. J. Immunol. 2005; 174: 5104-5114Crossref Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 13Koch J. Guntrum R. Heintke S. Kyritsis C. Tampé R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 10142-10147Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). To dissect the heterodimeric assembly of TAP in a more detailed way, we constructed a series of N-terminally truncated TAP2 chains in which we deleted the transmembrane helices TM1 to TM5 by progressively removing the N-terminal sequences (Fig. 5A). 2ΔTM1, 2ΔTM2, 2ΔTM3, 2ΔTM4, and 2ΔTM5 indicate five different truncated TAP2 chains lacking residues 2–42, 2–88, 2–128, 2–185, and 2–241, respectively (Fig. 5A). After expression of the different TAP2 variants in vitro in the presence of microsomes from T2(TAP1), we tested the complex formation between pre-existing TAP1 and newly synthesized TAP2 variants by immunodepletion experiments. As shown in Fig. 5B, all truncated TAP2 chains were efficiently expressed in vitro and integrated into microsomes prepared from T2(TAP1) to a comparable extent. However, only 2ΔTM1, 2ΔTM2 and 2ΔTM3 showed efficient complex formation with TAP1, whereas assembly was reduced or not observed for variants 2ΔTM4 and 2ΔTM5. This indicates that the structural integrity of the core TMD of TAP2, but not the presence of its N-domain, is necessary to allow efficient assembly with pre-existing TAP1. To explore whether in vitro expressed wild-type TAP2 and the N-domain-deprived variant 2ΔTM3 can participate in a functional heterodimeric peptide transporter, we measured transport activity of TAP complexes produced from T2(TAP1)-derived microsomes by transport assays with biotinylated model peptides. Purified microsomes from T2(TAPwt) and non-transfected T2 cells were used as additional controls. As can be seen from Fig. 6, TAP1/TAP2 and TAP1/2ΔTM3 complexes, which were generated by expression of TAP2 variants in vitro in the presence of microsomes derived from T2(TAP1), showed a 50–60% transport activity when compared with wild-type TAP in T2(TAPwt) microsomes. Thus, a significant amount of in vitro synthesized TAP molecules reaches a transport-active conformation. This strongly suggests that assembly between in vitro synthesized TAP2 and pre-existing TAP1 reflects a functional TAP complex formation in intact cells. In further transport assays, we used T2(TAP1)-derived microsomes containing in vitro expressed 2ΔTM4 and 2ΔTM5. In both cases very little or no peptide transport activity was measured (Fig. 6). Together with the results depicted in Fig. 5, this suggests that in contrast to the first N-terminal TM segments (N-domain), the TM segments 4 and 5 in the core TMD of newly synthesized TAP2 are part of the contact region that allows stable and functional interaction with pre-existing TAP1. Although TAP is one of the most intensely studied ABC transporters and constitutes a suitable model for many other members of the ABC transporter family, virtually nothing is known about its biogenesis in the ER. The pulse-chase experiments in Fig. 1 show that the stability of non-assembled TAP1 and TAP2 in vivo differs markedly. TAP2 expressed in isolation is rapidly degraded by a proteasome-dependent pathway with a half-life of 40 min while no significant degradation of TAP1 is seen over 240 min. High protein stability is also observed for assembled TAP subunits in T2-cells co-expressing TAP1 and TAP2. Although TAP2 can form homodimers when expressed in isolation, this is not sufficient to prevent degradation of the protein (Fig. 2B). This suggests that a stable protein conformation of TAP2, which protects the subunit from rapid degradation, requires physical association with TAP1. However, the experimental design of pulse-chase experiments on protein subunits, like TAP1 and TAP2, with different in vivo stability, makes it difficult to determine whether newly synthesized subunits pair with new or pre-existing subunits. Thus, we sought to analyze the process of TAP complex assembly in a cell-free in vitro transcription/translation system. Our experiments in Figs. 3, 4, 5, 6 show for the first time that a highly efficient and functional biogenesis of TAP heterodimers critically depends on the assembly of pre-existing fully synthesized TAP1 with newly synthesized TAP2. The role of TAP1 as an assembly platform for newly synthesized unstable TAP2 would explain the puzzling and so far poorly understood observation that the expression level of TAP1 determines the number of functional heterodimeric TAP molecules in the ER (14Zhu K. Wang J. Zhu J. Jiang J. Shou J. Chen X. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 7740-7747Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 15Herzer K. Falk C.S. Encke J. Eichhorst S.T. Ulsenheimer A. Seliger B. Krammer P.H. J. Virol. 2003; 77: 8299-8309Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Given a modulation of the TAP1 expression under certain pathological conditions (15Herzer K. Falk C.S. Encke J. Eichhorst S.T. Ulsenheimer A. Seliger B. Krammer P.H. J. Virol. 2003; 77: 8299-8309Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar) this may have significant implications in the context of viral infections or cancer. As suggested by a dramatic down-regulation of TAP in tumors of diverse tissue origin, sufficient levels of the TAP transporter are believed to be essential for a normal cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-mediated anti-cancer immune response and an efficient clearance of malignantly transformed cells (2Ritz U. Seliger B. Mol. Med. 2001; 7: 149-158Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The down-regulation of TAP is much more pronounced in metastatic than in primary carcinoma lesions suggesting that a reduction in the levels of functional transporter may be directly associated with the progression of disease (2Ritz U. Seliger B. Mol. Med. 2001; 7: 149-158Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Most interestingly, depending on the assembly state of TAP1, different subregions of its TMD are used for tapasin binding. Heterodimeric assembly of the TAP subunits is accompanied by a displacement of tapasin from the core TMD to the N-domain in TAP1, whereas TAP2 interacts with tapasin exclusively via the N-domain (5Leonhardt R.M. Keusekotten K. Bekpen C. Knittler M.R. J. Immunol. 2005; 174: 5104-5114Crossref Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Hence, regarding the properties of the TAP1/2ΔTM3 transporter, tapasin binding to TAP2 is clearly not essential for efficient assembly (Fig. 5B) or transport function (Fig. 6; (5Leonhardt R.M. Keusekotten K. Bekpen C. Knittler M.R. J. Immunol. 2005; 174: 5104-5114Crossref Scopus (49) Google Scholar)) of TAP. However, since tapasin is required for the accumulation of normal TAP1 protein levels (1Lankat-Buttgereit B. Tampé R. FEBS Lett. 1999; 464: 108-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), it may act as a chaperone that prevents premature homodimerization and rapid degradation of TAP1 chains by stabilizing the core TMD for interaction with newly synthesized TAP2 chains. In view of this and our present data, we propose that the biosynthetic assembly of TAP is controlled in a way that the level of TAP1 dynamically regulates the escape of newly synthesized TAP2 from ER-associated degradation and thereby determines the amount of functional transporters in the ER. We note that this is somewhat reminiscent of the oligomerization-dependent stabilization of the α-subunit in P-type Na,K-ATPases (16Beguin P. Hasler U. Staub O. Geering K. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 1657-1672Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 17Gatto C. McLoud S.M. Kaplan J.H. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 281: C982-C992Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Consequently, this type of mechanism is likely to have a general significance for the co-ordinate regulation of assembly of multisubunit transmembrane proteins synthesized in the ER. As mentioned above, TAP belongs to the family of the ABC transporters (18Higgins C.F. Hiles I.D. Salmond G.P.C. Gill D.R. Downie J.A. Evans I.J. Holland I.B. Gray L. Buckel S.D. Bell A.W. Hermondson M.A. Nature. 1986; 323: 448-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar). A distinguishing feature shared by the members of this large protein family is their modular structure. Each transporter molecule consists of four domains, including two TMDs and two NBDs, which are encoded either as a single polypeptide (tandem transporter), as two half-molecules (like TAP) or as three or four separate polypeptides (18Higgins C.F. Hiles I.D. Salmond G.P.C. Gill D.R. Downie J.A. Evans I.J. Holland I.B. Gray L. Buckel S.D. Bell A.W. Hermondson M.A. Nature. 1986; 323: 448-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar). Different studies have demonstrated that the N- and C-terminal halves of tandem ABC transporters, like MDR1 and CFTR, utilize different biogenesis pathways (19Zhang J.T. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 1709-1721Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 20Carveth K. Buck T. Anthony V. Skach W.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 39507-39514Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Thus, despite their conserved topology, corresponding TM segments within the N- and C-terminal TMDs encode dissimilar topogenic information and use different translocation mechanisms to acquire their final topology (19Zhang J.T. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 1709-1721Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 20Carveth K. Buck T. Anthony V. Skach W.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 39507-39514Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). A recent publication showed that co- and post-translational steps as well as interactions between domains are required for proper folding of CFTR (21Du K. Sharma M. Lukacs G.L. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2005; 12: 17-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). The N-terminal half of this tandem transporter is thought to fold in a co-translational manner whereas the domains of the C-terminal half fold post-translationally (21Du K. Sharma M. Lukacs G.L. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2005; 12: 17-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). Furthermore, it seems that in CFTR the correct post-translational folding of the C-terminal domains depends strictly on the proper co-translational folding/assembly of the N-terminal domains (21Du K. Sharma M. Lukacs G.L. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2005; 12: 17-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). Our data suggest that the biosynthetic assembly of the TAP-TMDs could be similar to that described for CFTR. In this scenario, the TAP1-TMD would analogous to the N-terminal half of CFTR mediate stable domain folding and correct membrane insertion of the TM segments of newly synthesized TAP2. Hence, our study suggests that tandem and half-size transporters, despite having a radically different genetic structure, may share a conserved assembly pathway. Cross-link experiments indicate that TAP2 expressed in isolation, in contrast to TAP1, tends to form homodimers (Fig. 2 and Ref. 12Antoniou A.N. Ford S. Pilley E.S. Blake N. Powis S.J. Immunology. 2002; 106: 182-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). In view of the distinct stability of the two TAP chains in vivo, this could suggest that TAP2 subunits are more sensitive to non-productive side reactions during the folding and assembly pathway than are TAP1 chains. The finding that pre-existing TAP2 subunits from microsomes of the transfectant T2(TAP2) do not interact with newly synthesized TAP1 suggests that homodimeric TAP2 complexes (Fig. 2) are “dead-end products” that largely prevent the normal formation of heterodimeric TAP molecules. Our own studies revealed that TAP2 homodimerization occurs in cell lines expressing single TAP2 but not in cells expressing both peptide transporter subunits (data not shown). This is in line with the observation that TAP2 chains interact more weakly with each other than with TAP1 subunits (12Antoniou A.N. Ford S. Pilley E.S. Blake N. Powis S.J. Immunology. 2002; 106: 182-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). In view of this, it is reasonable to assume that in the presence of both transporter subunits the process of functional TAP1/TAP2 assembly is highly favored over the non-functional homodimerization of TAP2. As truncation mutants of TAP1 and TAP2 have proved useful to examine the structural organization and function of TAP chains (5Leonhardt R.M. Keusekotten K. Bekpen C. Knittler M.R. J. Immunol. 2005; 174: 5104-5114Crossref Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 13Koch J. Guntrum R. Heintke S. Kyritsis C. Tampé R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 10142-10147Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar), we created N-terminally truncated TAP2 variants to analyze the requirements for newly synthesized TAP2 to form a complex with preexisting TAP1. TAP chains have unique N-terminal domains (N-domains) in addition to six core TM segments (13Koch J. Guntrum R. Heintke S. Kyritsis C. Tampé R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 10142-10147Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). We and others could previously show that the presence of these core TMDs is sufficient (5Leonhardt R.M. Keusekotten K. Bekpen C. Knittler M.R. J. Immunol. 2005; 174: 5104-5114Crossref Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 13Koch J. Guntrum R. Heintke S. Kyritsis C. Tampé R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 10142-10147Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar) and necessary (22Koch J. Guntrum R. Tampé R. FEBS Lett. 2005; 579: 4413-4416Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) for functional TAP assembly. Our findings on the in vitro expressed deletion variants of TAP2 indicate that this also holds true for in vitro expressed TAP complexes. In the case of variant 2ΔTM4, in which the TM segments TM1–TM4 are deleted, a 30–40% decrease in complex formation and a ≥80% reduction of transport activity was observed (Fig. 5). Similar observations were made for N-terminally truncated human TAP variants that were heterologously and transiently expressed in insect cells (22Koch J. Guntrum R. Tampé R. FEBS Lett. 2005; 579: 4413-4416Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). This suggests that the TM4 segment in the core TMD of TAP2 plays a critical role in the proper arrangement and stabilization of a functional TMD interface after complex formation with TAP1. No detectable complex formation or peptide transport could be observed for the transporter variant TAP1/2ΔTM5 that lacks TM1–TM5 segments in the in vitro expressed TAP2 chain (Fig. 5). Since the remaining TM segments of N-terminally truncated TAP2 variants are proposed to have the same membrane topology as in full-length TAP2 (23Vos J.C. Spee P. Momburg F. Neefjes J. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 6679-6685PubMed Google Scholar), we conclude from our findings that the TM segments 4 and 5 in the core TMD are of critical importance for the functional assembly of newly synthesized TAP2 with pre-existing TAP1. On the sequence level, the TM segments of the core TMDs of TAP1 and TAP2 align well with the TM segments of ABC transporters for which the TMD structures have been solved, e.g. MsbA (24Chang G. Roth C.B. Science. 2001; 293: 1793-1800Crossref PubMed Scopus (586) Google Scholar). The current view is that in the heterodimeric peptide transporter the assembled TMDs of TAP1 and TAP2 have grouped their two sets of six MsbA-related core TM segments (TM5–10 in TAP1 and TM4–9 in TAP2) in an antiparallel configuration (11Daumke O. Knittler M.R. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 4776-4786Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). In agreement with the biochemical experiments on P-glycoprotein (25Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol.

Science. 2001; 293: 1793-1800Crossref PubMed Scopus (586) Google Scholar), the different assembly properties of TAP2 and its N-terminal deletion variants (Figs. 5 and 6) support a structural model of TAP in which the major dimerization interface between opposing TAP subunits is formed by the second and fifth TM segment in the core TMDs of TAP2 (TM5 and TM8) and TAP1 (TM6 and TM9). Our findings demonstrate that the in vitro expression system provides a straightforward experimental tool to analyze the biosynthetic assembly of ER-localized oligomeric polytopic transmembrane proteins. The experimental results of this study open up new possibilities to investigate the structure and function of TAP, in particular with respect to the relative orientation and function of the TM segments at the domain interface between the core TMDs of TAP1 and TAP2.

https://openalex.org/W1972669737,"α-Thrombin has two separate electropositive binding exosites (anion binding exosite I, ABE-I and anion binding exosite II, ABE-II) that are involved in substrate tethering necessary for efficient catalysis. α-Thrombin catalyzes the activation of factor V and factor VIII following discrete proteolytic cleavages. Requirement for both anion binding exosites of the enzyme has been suggested for the activation of both procofactors by α-thrombin. We have used plasma-derived α-thrombin, β-thrombin (a thrombin molecule that has only ABE-II available), and a recombinant prothrombin molecule rMZ-II (R155A/R284A/R271A) that can only be cleaved at Arg320 (resulting in an enzymatically active molecule that has only ABE-I exposed, rMZ-IIa) to ascertain the role of each exosite for procofactor activation. We have also employed a synthetic sulfated pentapeptide ( DY(SO3−)DY(SO3−)Q, designated D5Q1,2) as an exosite-directed inhibitor of thrombin. The clotting time obtained with β-thrombin was increased by ∼8-fold, whereas rMZ-IIa was 4-fold less efficient in promoting clotting than α-thrombin under similar experimental conditions. α-Thrombin readily activated factor V following cleavages at Arg709, Arg1018, and Arg1545 and factor VIII following proteolysis at Arg372, Arg740, and Arg1689. Cleavage of both procofactors byα-thrombin was significantly inhibited by D5Q1,2. In contrast, β-thrombin was unable to cleave factor V at Arg1545 and factor VIII at both Arg372 and Arg1689. The former is required for light chain formation and expression of optimum factor Va cofactor activity, whereas the latter two cleavages are a prerequisite for expression of factor VIIIa cofactor activity. β-Thrombin was found to cleave factor V at Arg709 and factor VIII at Arg740, albeit less efficiently than α-thrombin. The sulfated pentapeptide inhibited moderately both cleavages by β-thrombin. Under similar experimental conditions, membrane-bound rMZ-IIa cleaved and activated both procofactor molecules. Activation of the two procofactors by membrane-bound rMZ-IIa was severely impaired by D5Q1,2. Overall the data demonstrate that ABE-I alone of α-thrombin can account for the interaction of both procofactors with α-thrombin resulting in their timely and efficient activation. Because formation of meizothrombin precedes that of α-thrombin, our findings also imply that meizothrombin may be the physiological activator of both procofactors in vivo in the presence of a procoagulant membrane surface during the early stages of coagulation."
https://openalex.org/W2143294640,"Chondroitin sulfate (CS) was administered orally to BALB/c mice immunized intraperitoneally with ovalbumin (OVA) and/or dinitrophenylated OVA. The titers of antigen-specific IgE and IgG1 in mouse sera were determined. The antigen-specific IgE production by mice fed ad libitum with CS was significantly inhibited. We also examined the effect of feeding CS on immediate-type hypersensitivity. One hour after antigen stimulation, the ears of mice fed with CS swelled less than those of the control mice. Furthermore, the rise in serum histamine in the mice fed with CS under active systemic anaphylaxis was significantly lower than that in the controls. We next examined the pattern of cytokine production by splenocytes from mice followed by re-stimulation with OVA in vitro. The splenocytes from the mice fed with CS produced less interleukin (IL)-5, IL-10, and IL-13 than those from the control group. In contrast, the production of interferon-γ and IL-2 by the splenocytes of mice fed with CS was not significantly different from those in the control mice. In addition, the production of transforming growth factor-β from the splenocytes of mice fed with CS was significantly higher than that of the control mice. Furthermore, we showed that the percentages of CD4+ cells, CD8+ cells, and CD4+CD25+ cells in the splenocytes of mice fed with CS are significantly higher than those of the control. These findings suggest that oral intake of CS inhibits the specific IgE production and antigen-induced anaphylactic response by up-regulating regulatory T-cell differentiation, followed by down-regulating the Th2 response.

The incidence of type I allergic disorders has been increasing worldwide, particularly, hypersensitivity to food and airborne allergens (1.Marks D.R. Marks L.M. Postgrad.

The mechanism of type I allergy includes a series of events (5.Matsuo N. Yamada K. Shoji K. Mori M. Sugano M. Allergy. 1997; 52: 58-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 6.Kawabe H. Hayashi H. Hayashi O. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1987; 143: 467-474Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), namely, production of antigen-specific IgE, binding of IgE to the FcϵRI receptor on mast cells or basophils, cross-linking of IgE with newly absorbed allergens, and release of chemical mediators such as histamine and leukotrienes from cells. Inhibition of any of the steps in this sequence leads to the attenuation of allergic symptoms. Several drugs, such as corticosteroids, epinephrine, histamine antagonists, and leukotriene synthesis inhibitors, interfere with the above reactions (7.Bochner B.S. Lichtenstein L.M. New. Engl. J. Med. 1991; 324: 1785-1790Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar). However, the effect of these drugs is short-lived; thus, a more fundamental means of preventing allergies is desirable.Chondroitin sulfate (CS) 3The abbreviations used are: CS, chondroitin sulfate; OVA, ovalbumin; DNP, dinitrophenylated; IL, interleukin; IFN, interferon; IELs, intraepithelial lymphocytes; PP, Peyer's patch; MLN, mesenteric lymph node; FBS, fetal bovine serum; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; FCM, flow cytometry; FITC, fluorescein isothiocyanate; PE, phycoerythrin; Tregs, regulatory T cells.3The abbreviations used are: CS, chondroitin sulfate; OVA, ovalbumin; DNP, dinitrophenylated; IL, interleukin; IFN, interferon; IELs, intraepithelial lymphocytes; PP, Peyer's patch; MLN, mesenteric lymph node; FBS, fetal bovine serum; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; FCM, flow cytometry; FITC, fluorescein isothiocyanate; PE, phycoerythrin; Tregs, regulatory T cells. is one of a family of structurally complex, sulfated, linear polysaccharides called glycosaminoglycans. CS is composed of a repeating disaccharide unit of the structure, [→4)GlcA(β1→3)GalNAc(β1→]n, where GlcA is glucuronic acid and GalNAc is N-acetylgalactosamine (8.Roden, L. (1980) in The Biochemistry of Glycoproteins and Proteoglycans (Lennarz, W. J., ed) pp. 267–371Google Scholar). CS contains, on average, one sulfate group per disaccharide unit at either the C-4 or C-6 positions of GalNAc (9.Kimata K. Okayama M. Oohira A. Suzuki S. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1973; 1: 211-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 10.Toida T. Toyoda H. Imanari T. Anal. Sci. 1993; 9: 53-58Crossref Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 11.Scott J.E. Pathol. Biol. (Paris). 2001; 49: 284-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). CS is an integral component of the proteoglycans found localized on cell surfaces and in the extracellular matrix and is important for cell-cell communications (9.Kimata K. Okayama M. Oohira A.

Recently, there have been a number of reports on the biochemical activities of orally administrated exogenous CS, including its anti-inflammatory and chondroprotective properties (12.Gallagher J.T.

It has been proposed that these activities result from an increase in the biosynthesis of connective tissue components, such as hyaluronan, at disease sites (20.Theoharides T.C. Patra P. Boucher W.

Arthritis Rheum. 2001; 31: 58-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Both in vitro and in vivo studies have shown that CS regulates the formation of new cartilage by stimulating the chondrocyte synthesis of collagen, proteoglycans and hyaluronan (22.McCarty M.F. Russell A.L. Seed M.P. Med. Hypotheses. 2000; 54: 798-802Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 23.Ishizeki K. Hiraki Y. Kubo M. Nawa T. Int. J. Dev. Biol. 1997; 41: 83-89PubMed Google Scholar).Polysaccharides such as CS are poorly absorbed through the digestive system (24.Conte A. Volpi N. Palmieri L. Bahous I. Ronca G. Arzneim. Forsch. 1995; 45: 918-925PubMed Google Scholar, 25.Baici A. Horler D. Moser B. Hofer H. Fehr K. Wagenhauser F. Rheumatol. Int. 1992; 12: 81-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Therefore, we examined the half-life of CS in the circulatory system and demonstrated it to be 3–15 min, based on the pharmacokinetic study of intravenously administrated CS (26.Sakai S. Onose J. Nakamura N. Toyoda H. Toida T. Imanari I. Linhardt R.J. Anal. Biochem. 2002; 302: 169-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Accordingly, it appears unlikely that orally administered CS is systemically distributed to connective tissues such as cartilage and skin and that exogenously administered CS actually directly stimulates chondrocyte synthesis of extracellular matrix components. This suggests that the mechanism of action of orally administrated CS might be mediated by other systems, such as the immunological system (27.Wrenshall L.E. Stevens R.B. Cerra F.B. Platt J.L. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1999; 66: 391-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Our laboratory has already shown that CS up-regulates the in vitro antigen-specific Th1 immune response on murine splenocytes sensitized with ovalbumin (OVA) and that CS suppresses the antigen-specific IgE responses. In addition, we have characterized the structure of CS chains required for these immunological effects (28.Sakai S. Akiyama H. Harikai N. Toyoda H. Toida T. Maitani T. Imanari T. Immunol. Lett. 2002; 84: 211-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 29.Akiyama H. Sakai S. Linhardt R.J. Goda Y. Toida T. Maitani T. Biochem. J. 2004; 382: 269-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). These studies suggest that the CS intake could control the IgE-mediated allergic response and Th2 response-mediated inflammatory diseases. However, no in vivo studies, on the effect of CS intake on the immune system, have yet been performed.In the present study, we examined the effect of CS intake on the production of specific IgE antibody and specific IgG antibody in OVA-sensitized mice. We also examined the effect of CS intake on antigen-induced anaphylactic response, such as ear swelling, and active systemic anaphylaxis in OVA-sensitized mice. Furthermore, to clarify the mechanism of inhibition of specific IgE production, we examined the pattern of cytokine production by splenocytes from mice fed with CS. In addition, to further assess the involvement of the immunological process of CS intake, we analyzed the differentiation in splenocytes, Peyer's patch (PP) cells, mesenteric lymph node (MLN) cells, and intestinal intraepithelial lymphocytes (IELs) using flow cytometry (FCM).EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESAnimals and Administration Protocols—Inbred specific pathogen-free BALB/c mice (female, 6 weeks of age) were purchased from Charles River Japan (Yokohama, Japan). The mice were maintained in a temperature (23–25 °C)-, humidity (40–60%)-, and light-controlled environment with free access to an MF diet (Japan SLC Co. Ltd., Shizuoka, Japan) and water. They were acclimatized for at least 1 week before the start of the study. The CS-fed group had 400 mg/kg/day of CS by daily gavage for 4 weeks or free access to 2% CS ad libitum for 4 weeks, respectively. The control group for CS by gavage had saline by daily gavage for 4 weeks, and the control group for 2% CS ad libitum had free access to water ad libitum for 4 weeks. The care and use of the experimental animals in this study followed “The Ethical Guidelines of Animal Care, Handling and Termination” prepared by the National Institute of Health Sciences of Japan.Reagents—CS samples (chondroitin 6-sulfate, average molecular weight Mr 31,000, from shark cartilage) were a kind gift from San Ei-Gen FFI Co. (Osaka, Japan). OVA (grade V, chicken egg) was purchased from Sigma Co. Dinitrophenylated (DNP)-OVA was purchased from Cosmobio Co., Ltd. (Tokyo, Japan). RPMI 1640 was purchased from ICN Biomedicals (Aurora, OH). Fetal bovine serum (FBS) was purchased from Sanko Junyaku (Tokyo, Japan), and it was heat-inactivated at 56 °C for 30 min prior to use.NMR and Compositional Analysis of CS—The determination of unsaturated disaccharides, prepared from CS, was performed on the lyase-digested samples using high-performance liquid chromatography (ΔDi-0S, 3.9%; ΔDi-4S, 24.5%; ΔDi-6S, 53.9%; ΔDi-diSE, 1.7%; ΔDi-diSB, 0.6%; ΔDi-diSD, 15.3%; and ΔDi-triS, 0.2%) (30.Toyoda H.

A. 1999; 830: 197-201Crossref Scopus (49) Google Scholar).1H NMR spectroscopy was performed using the conditions previously described by Toida et al. (10.Toida T. Toyoda H. Imanari T. Anal. Sci. 1993; 9: 53-58Crossref Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The CS sample (∼1–3 mg) was kept in a desiccator over phosphorus pentoxide in vacuo overnight at room temperature. The thoroughly dried sample was then dissolved in 500 μl of 2H2O (100%, Aldrich Japan, Tokyo), and passed through a 0.45-μm syringe filter and transferred to an NMR tube. 1D and 2D NMR experiments were performed using a JNM-ECP600 spectrometer of the Japan Electron Optical Laboratory (JEOL) equipped with a 5-mm field gradient, tunable probe with standard JEOL software at 333 K for all the experiments with 500-μl samples. The HO2H signal was suppressed by presaturation during 3 or 1.5 s for the 1D or 2D spectra, respectively. To obtain the 2D spectra, 512 experiments resulting in 1024 data points for a spectral width of 2,000 Hz were measured, and the time domain data were multiplied after zero filling (data matrix size, 1K × 1K) with a shifted sine-bell window functions for 2D double quantum-filtered and triple quantum filtered-COSY, NOESY, or TOCSY experiments. An MLEV-17 mixing sequence of 100 ms was used for the 2D TOCSY experiments, and for the NOESY experiments mixing times of 150, 250, and 500 ms were used. The purity of CS sample was thought to be >95% based on the compositional and NMR analyses (Fig. 1).Sensitization Protocols—Seven days after starting the administration of CS, all the mice were immunized intraperitoneally with OVA (20 μg/mice) and/or DNP-OVA (10 μg/mice) with an alum (Al(OH)3, Nagahama LSL Co. Ltd., Shiga, Japan) adjuvant. One week later, blood was collected and serum obtained. Ten days after the first immunization, the mice were given boosters using the same doses of the antigens. A week after the second immunization, all the mice were killed by cervical dislocation, their spleens aseptically removed, and cell suspensions made by passing them through a sterile cell strainer (BD Biosciences). Blood was withdrawn and serum obtained. The serum samples were stored at –20 °C prior to analysis (33.Akiyama H. Hoshino K. Tokuzumi M. Teshima R. Mori H. Inakuma T. Ishiguro Y. Goda Y. Sawada J.

For the study for the induction of active systemic anaphylactic shock, the experimental procedure after the second immunization is described below.Induction of Active Systemic Anaphylactic Shock and Measurement of Histamine in Plasma—The mice immunized with OVA were challenged intraperitoneally with 0.2 ml of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing OVA (1 mg/mouse) to induce anaphylactic shock. Ten minutes after antigen challenge, the mice were killed, and blood was collected to obtain serum for the histamine determination. Serum histamine concentrations were measured using the post-column high-performance liquid chromatography method described by Kawasaki et al. (35.Kawasaki M. Toyoda M. Teshima R. Sawada J. Saito Y. Biol. Pharm. Bull. 1994; 17: 1321-1325Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar).Ear Swelling Assay—Ten days after the second immunization, the ear thickness (time 0) of the mice was measured with an upright dial gauge (Ozaki Mfg. Co. Ltd., Tokyo, Japan). Ear swelling responses were elicited by applying 10 μl of antigen (1% picryl chloride in acetone) to the ventral sides of the left ears of the mice (33.Akiyama H. Hoshino K.

Ear thickness was measured at 1 h after picryl chloride challenge, and the increase in ear thickness from time 0 was determined.Antibody (Antigen-specific IgE and IgG1 Isotypes) Titer Determination—The mouse serum titers (reciprocal of serum dilution with fluorescence intensity at 50% of the maximum level) of anti-OVA IgE, IgG1, and IgG2a were determined in triplicate in a 96-well microtiter plate by the method of Teshima et al. with some modifications (34.Sato Y.

Fifty microliters of OVA (Cosmobio Co., 20 μg/ml) in 50 mm sodium carbonate buffer, pH 9.5, was added to each well of a 96-well microtiter plate and incubated overnight at 4 °C. Each well was washed four times with 200 μl of PBS containing 0.05% Tween 20 (PBS/Tween). Two hundred microliters of 0.1% casein in PBS was added, the plates were incubated for 1 h at room temperature, and then each well was washed as described above. Fifty microliters of antiserum was added to each well, the plates were incubated for 1 day at 4 °C, and then each well was washed as before. Fifty microliters of rabbit anti-mouse IgE/IgG1/IgG2a (10–3 dilution in PBS containing 0.1% casein, Yamasa Shoyu Co., Ltd., Chiba, Japan) was added to each well, the plates were incubated for 1 h at room temperature, and then each well was washed as before. Fifty microliters of sheep anti-rabbit-IgG-β-galactosidase conjugate (10–3 dilution in PBS containing 0.1% casein, Amersham Biosciences) was added to each well, the plates were incubated for 1 h at room temperature, and then each well was washed as before. The wells were incubated for 1 h at 37°C with 100 μl of PBS containing 0.1 mm 4-methylumbelliferone-β-galactoside (Sigma). Finally, 25 μl of 1 m anhydrous sodium carbonate was added to each well. The fluorescence intensity of the liberated 4-methylumbelliferone was monitored by a Titertek Fluoroskan reader (Flow Laboratories, Inc., Costa Mesa, CA).Cytokine Assays of Splenocytes—Splenocytes were collected from the removed spleens of all the OVA-immunized mice, and the cells (5 × 106 cells/ml) from each spleen were cultured in triplicate on a 24-well culture plate and re-stimulated with OVA at a final concentration of 100 μg/ml at 37 °C for 3 days (28.Sakai S. Akiyama H. Harikai N. Toyoda H. Toida T. Maitani T. Imanari T. Immunol. Lett. 2002; 84: 211-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The levels of interleukin (IL)-4, IL-5, IL-10, and IL-12 (p70), transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β), and interferon (IFN)-γ in the culture medium (RPMI 1640) after 3 days of co-culture with OVA were measured with an OptEIA mouse cytokine enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay set (BD Pharmingen). Absorbance was measured at 450 nm with a microplate reader (E-max, Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA).FCM Analysis of Splenocytes—The collected splenocytes from mice were washed twice in PBS containing 2% FBS, and then cell staining analysis was carried out in the following way (28.Sakai S. Akiyama H. Harikai N. Toyoda H. Toida T. Maitani T. Imanari T. Immunol. Lett. 2002; 84: 211-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 34.Sato Y. Akiyama H. Suganuma H. Watanabe T. Nagaoka M.H.

Briefly, 100 μl of splenocytes at 2.0 × 106 cells/ml in PBS containing 2% FBS and 0.1% NaN3 was mixed with 1 μl of anti-CD16/CD32 monoclonal antibody (BD Pharmingen, San Diego, CA) in a tube and reacted for 5 min at 4 °C. Fluorescently labeled antibodies at 0.0125 μg/10 μl were added to the above tubes; mixed and then incubated for 30 min at 4 °C in the dark. After staining, the cells were washed three times with PBS. After washing, the cells were poured into FCM tubes in PBS containing 2% FBS and 0.1% NaN3 in a total volume of 500 μl. We defined CD4+CD8– cells as helper T cells and CD4–CD8+ cells as cytotoxic T cells in the present study. The target for detection was CD3 as the T cell, and CD45R/B220+ as the B cell, the surface antigens of the respective cell populations.FCM analysis was performed with a FACSCalibur™ flow cytometer (BD Biosciences) (23.Ishizeki K. Hiraki Y. Kubo M. Nawa T. Int. J. Dev. Biol. 1997; 41: 83-89PubMed Google Scholar). Splenocytes were stained with peridinin chlorophyll protein-labeled anti-mouse CD3ϵ (145–2C11, BD Pharmingen), fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-labeled anti-mouse CD4 (H129.19, BD Pharmingen), phycoerythrin (PE)-labeled anti-mouse CD8α (53–6.7, BD Pharmingen), FITC-labeled anti-mouse CD25 (PC61, BD Pharmingen), and PE-labeled anti-mouse CD45R/B220 (RA3–6B2) antibodies. Fluorescence overlap was compensated electronically by using splenocytes stained with single colors, and then 10,000 cells were acquired and stored for each analysis. The data were analyzed using CellQuest® software.Isolation of IELs—The IELs were isolated as previously described by Nagafuchi (37.Nagafuchi S. Totsuka M. Hachimura S. Goto M. Takahashi T. Yajima T.

Once free of the luminal contents, it was turned inside-out with the aid of polyethylene tubing. Each reversed intestine was cut into four segments, and the segments were placed in a 50-ml polypropylene conical tube containing 45 ml of Hanks' balanced salt solution (Invitrogen) containing 5% FBS (Sigma). The tube was shaken at 37 °C for 45 min (horizontal position on an orbital shaker at 135 rpm), and the cell suspension was passed through a glass-wool column to remove any adherent cells. The cells were then suspended in 30% (w/v) Percoll (Amersham Biosciences) and centrifuged for 20 min at 1,800 rpm. The cell pellet was collected, and then the IELs were purified by density-gradient centrifugation using Percoll as the separation medium (1,800 rpm, 20 min). The IELs were recovered at the 44 and 70% Percoll interphases. More than 90% of the IELs were recovered.Isolation of the PP Cells and MLN Cells—The PP and MLN cells were recovered from OVA-immunized mice by dissection from the small intestines, and single-cell suspensions were prepared by pressing the PPs and the MLNs through a nylon mesh Cell Strainer (BD Falcon, Franklin Lakes, NJ). The cell suspension was centrifuged and washed three times in RPMI 1640 containing 10% FBS (39.Okunuki H. Teshima R. Harikai N. Sakai S. Akiyama H. Maitani T. Sawada J. Biol. Pharm. Bull. 2003; 26: 1260-1265Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar).FCM Analysis of the PP Cells, MLN Cells, and IELs—A three-color analysis of the PP cells, MLN cells, and IEL subsets was performed (39.Okunuki H. Teshima R. Harikai N. Sakai S. Akiyama H. Maitani T. Sawada J. Biol. Pharm. Bull. 2003; 26: 1260-1265Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). The antibodies used for the FCM were FITC-labeled anti-mouse Integrin β7 chain (M293, BD Pharmingen), FITC-labeled goat F(ab′)2 anti-mouse IgM plus IgG plus IgA (H plus L) (Southern Biotechnology Associates, Inc., Birmingham, AL), peridinin chlorophyll protein-labeled anti-mouse CD3ϵ, FITC- and peridinin chlorophyll protein-labeled antimouse CD4, PE-labeled anti-mouse CD8α, FITC-labeled anti-mouse CD8β (53-5.8, BD Pharmingen), FITC-labeled anti-mouse TCRαβ (H57-597, Immunotech, Marseille, France), PE-labeled anti-mouse TCRγδ (GL3, Immunotech), FITC-labeled anti-mouse CD25, and PE-labeled anti-mouse CD45R/B220 antibodies. All incubations were performed in the dark. A single cell suspension of lymphocytes in BD Pharmingen Stain Buffer containing 2% FBS was incubated with 50 μl of properly diluted monoclonal antibody at 4 °C for 30 min. The cells were washed in Hanks' balanced salt solution and recovered by centrifugation. After staining, a total of at least 10,000 cells was analyzed using a FACSCalibur™. The data were analyzed using CellQuest® software.Statistical Analysis—All values are expressed as means ± S.E. Statistical comparisons were performed by using the Student's t test or Scheffe's method after an analysis of variances. In all cases, the probability (p) values below 0.05 were considered significant.RESULTSBody Weight and the Amount of Feed Intake—We first examined whether CS intake by gavage or orally ad libitum affect the body weight and feed intake of the mice. There was no significant difference in the body weight and the amount of feed intake between the control group and the CS-fed group for both administration methods during the experimental period. No specific symptoms were observed in the CS group during the study.Specific IgE and IgG Production in Vivo—The group of mice administered CS by gavage and immunized with DNP-OVA or OVA showed a serum titer of DNP-specific IgE antibodies and OVA-specific IgE antibodies lower than those in the control group, although the specific IgE antibodies of both the CS group and the control were not significantly different (Fig. 2).FIGURE 2Effects of CS on the serum antigen-specific antibody titer in secondary immune response. Bars represent mean values ± S.D. of five mice. CS (400 mg/kg/day) was administered by gavage from the first immunization to 7 days after the second immunization.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)In contrast, in the group of mice administered CS orally ad libitum and immunized with OVA, the serum titers of OVA-specific IgE antibodies and OVA-specific IgG1 antibodies were significantly lower than those in the control group (Fig. 3). This result suggests that the oral ad libitum administration of CS inhibits the production of OVA-specific IgE and OVA-specific IgG1 antibodies. We postulate that the successive oral intake of CS is more effective for the inhibition of OVA-specific IgG1 antibody production or that the inhibitory effects are dependent on the oral intake amount of CS.FIGURE 3Effects of CS on the serum antigen-specific antibody titer in secondary immune response. Bars represent mean values ± S.D. of 10 mice. CS was administered orally ad libitum from 7 days before the first immunization to 7 days after the second immunization.

Therefore, we examined the effect of CS on the ear swelling response at 1 h after antigen stimulation as a test of immediate-type hypersensitivity (33.Akiyama H. Hoshino K. Tokuzumi M. Teshima R. Mori H. Inakuma T. Ishiguro Y. Goda Y. Sawada J. Toyoda M. Biol. Pharm. Bull. 1999; 22: 551-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). In the control group sensitized with DNP-OVA, the ear thickness significantly increased 1 h after antigen stimulation. The increase in ear thickness observed in the group orally administered CS was significantly lower than that of the control group (Fig. 4).FIGURE 4Effects of CS on the immunized mice ear swelling responses 1 h after epicutaneous challenge with picryl chloride.

Land crabs, like their aquatic cousins, have hard exoskeletons that they outgrow and periodically shed. It's one thing to do that in water, which acts as a temporary hydrostatic skeleton and gives buoyancy. Quite another on land. New work on the blackback land crab shows how it overcomes the problem by inflating its gut with air, thereby providing support in the form of increased body turgor. The combined use of gas and liquid as skeletal support in a terrestrial arthropod could be more than an adaptation to low water availability; it may also be a biomechanical adaptation to the greater gravitational forces associated with life on land. Like their aquatic counterparts, terrestrial crabs repeatedly shed their rigid exoskeleton during moulting. But in the case of land crabs, little water is available to provide a temporary hydrostatic skeleton before the new skeleton hardens, and air does not provide the buoyancy necessary to support the animal. Here we show that whenever its exoskeleton is shed, the blackback land crab Gecarcinus lateralis relies on an unconventional type of hydrostatic skeleton that uses both gas and liquid (a ‘pneumo-hydrostat’). To our knowledge, this is the first experimental evidence for a locomotor skeleton that depends on a gas. It establishes a new category of hydrostatic skeletal support and possibly a critical adaptation to life on land for the Crustacea."

https://openalex.org/W2076807807,"Dihydroorotate dehydrogenase B (DHODB) catalyzes the oxidation of dihydroorotate (DHO) to orotate and is found in the pyrimidine biosynthetic pathway. The Lactococcus lactis enzyme is a dimer of heterodimers containing FMN, FAD, and a 2Fe-2S center. Lys-D48 is found in the catalytic subunit and its side-chain adopts different positions, influenced by ligand binding. Based on crystal structures of DHODB in the presence and absence of orotate, we hypothesized that Lys-D48 has a role in facilitating electron transfer in DHODB, specifically in stabilizing negative charge in the reduced FMN isoalloxazine ring. We show that mutagenesis of Lys-D48 to an alanine, arginine, glutamine, or glutamate residue (mutants K38A, K48R, K48Q, and K48E) impairs catalytic turnover substantially (approximately 50-500-fold reduction in turnover number). Stopped-flow studies demonstrate that loss of catalytic activity is attributed to poor rates of FMN reduction by substrate. Mutation also impairs electron transfer from the 2Fe-2S center to FMN. Addition of methylamine leads to partial rescue of flavin reduction activity. Nicotinamide coenzyme oxidation and reduction at the distal FAD site is unaffected by the mutations. Formation of the spin-interacting state between the FMN semiquinone-reduced 2Fe-2S centers observed in wild-type enzyme is retained in the mutant proteins, consistent with there being little perturbation of the superexchange paths that contribute to the efficiency of electron transfer between these cofactors. Our data suggest a key charge-stabilizing role for Lys-D48 during reduction of FMN by dihydroorotate, or by electron transfer from the 2Fe-2S center, and establish a common mechanism of FMN reduction in the single FMN-containing A-type and the complex multicenter B-type DHOD enzymes."
