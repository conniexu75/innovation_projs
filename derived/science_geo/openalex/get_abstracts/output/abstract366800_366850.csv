https://openalex.org/W2009931781,"<h2>Summary</h2> Oncogenic mutations in the small GTPase Ras are highly prevalent in cancer, but an understanding of the vulnerabilities of these cancers is lacking. We undertook a genome-wide RNAi screen to identify synthetic lethal interactions with the KRAS oncogene. We discovered a diverse set of proteins whose depletion selectively impaired the viability of Ras mutant cells. Among these we observed a strong enrichment for genes with mitotic functions. We describe a pathway involving the mitotic kinase PLK1, the anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome, and the proteasome that, when inhibited, results in prometaphase accumulation and the subsequent death of Ras mutant cells. Gene expression analysis indicates that reduced expression of genes in this pathway correlates with increased survival of patients bearing tumors with a Ras transcriptional signature. Our results suggest a previously underappreciated role for Ras in mitotic progression and demonstrate a pharmacologically tractable pathway for the potential treatment of cancers harboring Ras mutations."

A photonic crystal patterning is applied to the nanobeams to localize optical and mechanical energy to the same cubic-micron-scale volume. The picrogram-scale mass of the structure, along with the strong per-photon optical gradient force, results in a giant optical spring effect. In addition, a novel damping regime is explored in which the small heat capacity of the zipper cavity results in blue-detuned opto-mechanical damping."
https://openalex.org/W2136076059,"An alternative to therapeutic targeting of oncogenes is to perform ""synthetic lethality"" screens for genes that are essential only in the context of specific cancer-causing mutations. We used high-throughput RNA interference (RNAi) to identify synthetic lethal interactions in cancer cells harboring mutant KRAS, the most commonly mutated human oncogene. We find that cells that are dependent on mutant KRAS exhibit sensitivity to suppression of the serine/threonine kinase STK33 irrespective of tissue origin, whereas STK33 is not required by KRAS-independent cells. STK33 promotes cancer cell viability in a kinase activity-dependent manner by regulating the suppression of mitochondrial apoptosis mediated through S6K1-induced inactivation of the death agonist BAD selectively in mutant KRAS-dependent cells. These observations identify STK33 as a target for treatment of mutant KRAS-driven cancers and demonstrate the potential of RNAi screens for discovering functional dependencies created by oncogenic mutations that may enable therapeutic intervention for cancers with ""undruggable"" genetic alterations."
https://openalex.org/W2137007437,"Systemic acquired resistance (SAR) is a broad-spectrum plant immune response involving profound transcriptional changes that are regulated by the coactivator NPR1. Nuclear translocation of NPR1 is a critical regulatory step, but how the protein is regulated in the nucleus is unknown. Here, we show that turnover of nuclear NPR1 protein plays an important role in modulating transcription of its target genes. In the absence of pathogen challenge, NPR1 is continuously cleared from the nucleus by the proteasome, which restricts its coactivator activity to prevent untimely activation of SAR. Surprisingly, inducers of SAR promote NPR1 phosphorylation at residues Ser11/Ser15, and then facilitate its recruitment to a Cullin3-based ubiquitin ligase. Turnover of phosphorylated NPR1 is required for full induction of target genes and establishment of SAR. These in vivo data demonstrate dual roles for coactivator turnover in both preventing and stimulating gene transcription to regulate plant immunity.

These in vivo data demonstrate dual roles for coactivator turnover in both preventing and stimulating gene transcription to regulate plant immunity. Immune responses are tightly regulated in all eukaryotes to ensure that they are effective only against invading pathogens but not harmful to selves. In contrast to animals, plants lack a specialized immune system and instead rely on each individual cell for defense. In response to pathogen challenge, plant cells undergo dramatic transcription reprogramming to favor immune responses over normal cellular functions. Failure to do so results in infection. On the other hand, suppressing immune responses in the absence of a pathogen threat is equally important for maintaining plant growth and development. Thus, plants have sophisticated regulatory mechanisms to control defense-related transcription. An important signal molecule for defense-related transcription in plants is salicylic acid (SA). Pathogen-induced increases in cellular SA levels or exogenous application of SA leads to profound changes in gene transcription (reviewed in Durrant and Dong, 2004Durrant W.E. Dong X. Systemic acquired resistance.Annu. Rev. Phytopathol. 2004; 42: 185-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (1857) Google Scholar). These changes occur through the activity of the transcription coactivator NPR1 (nonexpressor of pathogenesis-related (PR) genes), a master regulator of plant immunity. Mutations in the NPR1 gene in Arabidopsis block this SA-mediated transcriptional reprogramming and renders the plant completely defective in systemic acquired resistance (SAR), an inducible immune response against a broad-spectrum of pathogens (Cao et al., 1994Cao H.

The activity of NPR1 is regulated in part by its subcellular localization (Kinkema et al., 2000Kinkema M. Fan W. Dong X. Nuclear localization of NPR1 is required for activation of PR gene expression.Plant Cell. 2000; 12: 2339-2350PubMed Google Scholar). In unchallenged cells NPR1 is predominantly sequestered in the cytoplasm as a high molecular weight oligomeric complex (Mou et al., 2003Mou Z. Fan W. Dong X. Inducers of plant systemic acquired resistance regulate NPR1 function through redox changes.Cell. 2003; 113: 935-944Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (996) Google Scholar). The oligomeric complex is formed through redox-sensitive intermolecular disulfide bonds between conserved cysteine residues. Upon pathogen infection, accumulation of SA triggers a change in cellular reduction potential, resulting in partial reduction of NPR1 oligomer to monomer. A bipartite nuclear localization sequence targets the released NPR1 monomer to the nucleus where it functions as a coactivator of gene transcription (Kinkema et al., 2000Kinkema M. Fan W. Dong X. Nuclear localization of NPR1 is required for activation of PR gene expression.Plant Cell. 2000; 12: 2339-2350PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, NPR1 was found to interact with TGA transcription factors (Després et al., 2000Després C. DeLong C. Glaze S. Liu E. Fobert P.R.

NPR1 may affect both the DNA binding capacity and the activity of TGA factors (Després et al., 2000Després C. DeLong C. Glaze S. Liu E. Fobert P.R.

Besides the PR genes, which encode antimicrobial effectors, NPR1 also directly activates the expression of several WRKY transcription factors with both activator and suppressor activities (Wang et al., 2006Wang D. Amornsiripanitch N. Dong X. A genomic approach to identify regulatory nodes in the transcriptional network of systemic acquired resistance in plants.PLoS Pathog. 2006; 2: e123https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.ppat.0020123Crossref PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar). Thus, NPR1 regulates plant immunity through a transcription cascade involving multiple transcription factors. A major challenge in understanding the function of NPR1 is to uncover the nuclear regulation of this coactivator. Phosphorylation and ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis are prominent post-translational mechanisms that control transcription regulators. In mammalian immunity, the cofactor IκB, which shares structural features with NPR1 (Cao et al., 1997Cao H. Glazebrook J. Clarke J.D. Volko S. Dong X. The Arabidopsis NPR1 gene that controls systemic acquired resistance encodes a novel protein containing ankyrin repeats.Cell. 1997; 88: 57-63Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1040) Google Scholar, Ryals et al., 1997Ryals J. Weymann K. Lawton K. Friedrich L. Ellis D. Steiner H.Y. Johnson J. Delaney T.P. Jesse T. Vos P. et al.The Arabidopsis NIM1 protein shows homology to the mammalian transcription factor inhibitor IκB.Plant Cell. 1997; 9: 425-439PubMed Google Scholar), functions to sequester the transcription factor NF-κB in the cytoplasm and prevents it from activating gene expression. In response to pathogen attack, IκB is rapidly phosphorylated and targeted for ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis, allowing NF-κB to localize to the nucleus and activate target genes (Hayden and Ghosh, 2004Hayden M.S. Ghosh S. Signaling to NF-κB.Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 2195-2224Crossref PubMed Scopus (3197) Google Scholar). Furthermore, transcription factors are often unstable and a significant overlap has been found between transcriptional activation domains and domains that regulate ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis (Salghetti et al., 2000Salghetti S.E. Muratani M. Wijnen H. Futcher B. Tansey W.P. Functional overlap of sequences that activate transcription and signal ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2000; 97: 3118-3123Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). Recent findings indicate that proteasome-mediated turnover of activators may be essential for their ability to activate transcription (Collins and Tansey, 2006Collins G.A. Tansey W.P. The proteasome: a utility tool for transcription?.Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2006; 16: 197-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). Whereas activator turnover is thought to stimulate gene transcription, it remains largely unknown if proteolysis plays a role in the regulation of transcription coactivators. In this study we investigated if the coactivator NPR1 is regulated by post-translational mechanisms. Our findings revealed opposing roles for coactivator proteolysis in the regulation of gene transcription and demonstrate that multicellular organisms employ proteolysis-coupled transcription as a mechanism to control their responses to external stimuli. To examine if protein stability plays a role in NPR1 regulation, we performed a cell-free degradation assay (see Supplemental Experimental Procedures available with this article online) using extracts from wild-type Col-0 plants and previously characterized transgenic 35S::NPR1-GFP plants (Kinkema et al., 2000Kinkema M. Fan W. Dong X. Nuclear localization of NPR1 is required for activation of PR gene expression.Plant Cell. 2000; 12: 2339-2350PubMed Google Scholar, Mou et al., 2003Mou Z. Fan W. Dong X. Inducers of plant systemic acquired resistance regulate NPR1 function through redox changes.Cell. 2003; 113: 935-944Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (996) Google Scholar). We found that both the endogenous NPR1 and NPR1-GFP were completely degraded within 2 hr (Figure 1A). To test which cellular mechanism is responsible for this observed degradation, we studied the effect of several proteolysis inhibitors. Whereas addition of the proteasome inhibitors MG115 or MG132 prevented NPR1 and NPR1-GFP degradation, the protease inhibitors leupeptin and PMSF were ineffective in this respect (Figure 1A), indicating that NPR1 degradation specifically requires proteasome activity. NPR1 degradation was then examined in planta by treating wild-type Col-0 plants with MG115 or MG132. Similar to SA-induced plants, inhibition of proteasome activity significantly enhanced the accumulation of both NPR1 oligomer and monomer (Figure 1B). To eliminate the effect of transcriptional regulation on NPR1 protein concentration, we examined the 35S::NPR1-GFP plants, which constitutively express the transgene independent of SA and proteasome inhibitor treatment (Figure S1). As reported previously (Kinkema et al., 2000Kinkema M. Fan W. Dong X. Nuclear localization of NPR1 is required for activation of PR gene expression.Plant Cell. 2000; 12: 2339-2350PubMed Google Scholar, Mou et al., 2003Mou Z. Fan W. Dong X. Inducers of plant systemic acquired resistance regulate NPR1 function through redox changes.Cell. 2003; 113: 935-944Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (996) Google Scholar), GFP fluorescence was weak in untreated plants due to the oligomeric status of the NPR1-GFP protein (Figures 1C and 1D). SA treatment induced NPR1-GFP monomer formation, resulting in strong GFP fluorescence in the nuclei (Figure 1C). Plants treated with MG115 or MG132 also exhibited readily detectable GFP fluorescence in the nuclei (Figure 1C) and showed a significant increase in total NPR1 protein (Figure 1D; +DTT). As shown in nonreducing western blot analysis, this increase was predominantly in the form of NPR1 monomer (Figure 1D; -DTT). Consequently, the NPR1 target gene PR-1 was induced in these MG115- or MG132-treated plants, albeit at a level lower than that found in SA-treated plants (Figure 1D). These data indicate that transcriptionally active NPR1 is constantly degraded by the proteasome. Blocking proteasome activity causes ectopic accumulation of NPR1 monomer and spurious expression of its target genes. However, an additional SA-dependent mechanism seems to be required to fully turn on transcriptional activity of NPR1. We then investigated whether NPR1 oligomer and monomer are equally sensitive to proteasome-mediated degradation using plant extracts supplemented with or without the reducing agent dithiothreitol (DTT). Addition of 5 mM DTT reduced nearly all NPR1-GFP oligomer to its monomeric form (Figure S2) and consequently accelerated its degradation (Figure 1E), suggesting that NPR1 monomer is preferentially degraded. Because NPR1 monomer was observed in the nucleus upon proteasome inhibitor treatment, we hypothesized that proteolysis of NPR1 may occur there. To test this hypothesis, we examined the in vivo stability of NPR1-GFP and the nuclear localization sequence (nls) mutant npr1-nls-GFP by treating plants with the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide (CHX). Whereas the amount of NPR1-GFP rapidly decreased in the absence of new protein synthesis, the levels of npr1-nls-GFP, which has been shown before to reside predominantly in the cytoplasm (Kinkema et al., 2000Kinkema M. Fan W. Dong X. Nuclear localization of NPR1 is required for activation of PR gene expression.Plant Cell. 2000; 12: 2339-2350PubMed Google Scholar), remained unchanged (Figure 1F). The lack of degradation of npr1-nls-GFP was probably due to its cytosolic mislocalization, not resistance to degradation per se, because the mutant protein was as readily degraded as the wild-type protein in cell-free extracts (data not shown). To confirm this result, we also used plants expressing NPR1 fused to a dexamethasone (DEX)-responsive glucocorticoid receptor (NPR1-GR) (Kinkema et al., 2000Kinkema M. Fan W. Dong X. Nuclear localization of NPR1 is required for activation of PR gene expression.Plant Cell. 2000; 12: 2339-2350PubMed Google Scholar). In the absence of DEX, NPR1-GR was retained in the cytosol and its abundance was not affected by CHX treatment (Figure 1G). In the presence of DEX, however, NPR1-GR was nuclear translocated and rapidly degraded. These findings demonstrate that in vivo NPR1 monomer is constitutively degraded in the nucleus by the proteasome. Since blocking entry into the nucleus completely stabilized the protein, NPR1 monomer is probably degraded only in the nucleus. NPR1 contains a BTB/POZ (broad-complex, tramtrack, and bric-à-brac/poxvirus, zinc finger) domain, which is found in proteins that function as substrate adapters of CUL3-based ubiquitin ligases for the degradation of specific substrates (Petroski and Deshaies, 2005Petroski M.D. Deshaies R.J. Function and regulation of cullin-RING ubiquitin ligases.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2005; 6: 9-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (1555) Google Scholar). Interestingly, BTB-containing proteins themselves may also be substrates for these CUL3 complexes (Luke-Glaser et al., 2007Luke-Glaser S. Roy M. Larsen B. Le Bihan T. Metalnikov P. Tyers M. Peter M. Pintard L. CIF-1, a shared subunit of the COP9/signalosome and eukaryotic initiation factor 3 complexes, regulates MEL-26 levels in the Caenorhabditis elegans embryo.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2007; 27: 4526-4540Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, Pintard et al., 2003Pintard L. Willis J.H. Willems A. Johnson J.L. Srayko M. Kurz T. Glaser S. Mains P.E. Tyers M. Bowerman B. et al.The BTB protein MEL-26 is a substrate-specific adaptor of the CUL-3 ubiquitin-ligase.Nature. 2003; 425: 311-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). Since NPR1 is degraded by the proteasome, we tested the possibility that NPR1 is a substrate of CUL3-based ubiquitin ligases using coimmunoprecipitation experiments between NPR1-GFP and CUL3A. Even though previously reported yeast two-hybrid analysis found no direct interaction between CUL3A and NPR1 (Dieterle et al., 2005Dieterle M. Thomann A. Renou J.P. Parmentier Y. Cognat V. Lemonnier G. Muller R. Shen W.H. Kretsch T. Genschik P. Molecular and functional characterization of Arabidopsis Cullin 3A.Plant J. 2005; 41: 386-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), NPR1-GFP could be pulled down with an antibody against CUL3A (Figure 2A). This suggests that CUL3 and NPR1 may interact indirectly through an adaptor protein. To validate the NPR1-CUL3 interaction genetically, we generated a double mutant between Arabidopsis cul3a and cul3b, both of which are T-DNA insertion mutants. It has been shown previously that a cul3a cul3b double knock-out is embryonic lethal (Figueroa et al., 2005Figueroa P. Gusmaroli G. Serino G. Habashi J. Ma L. Shen Y. Feng S. Bostick M. Callis J. Hellmann H. et al.Arabidopsis has two redundant Cullin3 proteins that are essential for embryo development and that interact with RBX1 and BTB proteins to form multisubunit E3 ubiquitin ligase complexes in vivo.Plant Cell. 2005; 17: 1180-1195Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, Thomann et al., 2005Thomann A. Brukhin V. Dieterle M. Gheyeselinck J. Vantard M. Grossniklaus U. Genschik P. Arabidopsis CUL3A and CUL3B genes are essential for normal embryogenesis.Plant J. 2005; 43: 437-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). To overcome this obstacle we generated a cul3a cul3b double mutant using a knockout cul3a allele and a ∼50% knockdown cul3b allele (Figure S3), which resulted in viable adult plants. Compared to the wild-type, NPR1 mRNA levels were reduced in the cul3a cul3b mutant (Figure S4). Nevertheless, steady-state NPR1 protein levels were comparable in wild-type and mutant plants (Figure 2B), suggesting that NPR1 protein is more stable in absence of CUL3. To further test this, wild-type Col-0 and cul3a cul3b plants were treated with CHX to block new protein synthesis. CHX treatment led to a decrease in the amount of NPR1 in the wild-type, yet NPR1 levels did not decrease in cul3a cul3b plants (Figure 2B). Similar results were obtained for NPR1-GFP protein expressed in wild-type and cul3a cul3b plants (Figure 2B). The COP9 signalosome (CSN) has been shown to regulate the stability and activity of CUL proteins by cycles of (de)neddylation, a process in which lysine residues are modified by the ubiquitin-like molecule Nedd8 (Petroski and Deshaies, 2005Petroski M.D. Deshaies R.J. Function and regulation of cullin-RING ubiquitin ligases.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2005; 6: 9-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (1555) Google Scholar). To investigate if the CSN is also involved in NPR1 degradation, the 35S::NPR1-GFP transgene was introduced into the cop9 mutant background through genetic crosses. As shown in Figure 2C, NPR1-GFP degradation was dramatically blocked by the cop9 mutation. If degradation of transcriptionally active NPR1 monomer is to keep SAR inactive in unchallenged plants, we expected this regulation to be compromised in the cul3a cul3b mutant. Indeed, compared to wild-type plants, unchallenged cul3a cul3b mutants showed high constitutive expression of the NPR1 target genes PR-1, PR-2, and PR-5 (Figure 2D). Importantly, this constitutive PR gene expression was NPR1-dependent, because it was completely lost in the cul3a cul3b npr1-1 triple mutant (Figure 2D). In accordance with the observed constitutive PR gene activation, cul3a cul3b plants exhibited elevated levels of resistance against the virulent bacterial leaf-pathogen Pseudomonas syringae pv. maculicola (Psm) ES4326 (Figure S5). Collectively, these findings demonstrate that in unchallenged plants, CUL3/CSN-mediated degradation of transcriptionally active NPR1 monomer prevents costly activation of PR genes and SAR. SA induces the release of transcriptionally active NPR1 monomer, which regulates the expression of many defense genes. This prompted us to investigate the effect of SA on NPR1 degradation. Unexpectedly, coimmunoprecipitation experiments indicated that in SA treated plants, more NPR1-GFP was pulled down with CUL3A and three components of the CSN complex (COP9, CSN4, CSN5; Figure 3A). To reconcile this with the fact that SA treatment leads to accumulation of NPR1-GFP monomer in the nucleus (Figure 3B), we hypothesized that this accumulation resulted from a significant increase in NPR1-GFP import into the nucleus rather than a reduction in protein degradation. Indeed, SA-induced monomer was completely absent when de novo protein synthesis was inhibited by CHX (Figure 3B). Accordingly, western blot analysis indicated that SA treatment did not rescue NPR1-GFP protein from degradation (Figure 3C). These data indicate that proteolysis of NPR1 still occurs after SAR induction despite the fact that NPR1 is a positive regulator of this response. We then examined whether proteasome activity affects induction of the NPR1 target genes WRKY18, WRKY38, and WRKY62 (Wang et al., 2006Wang D. Amornsiripanitch N. Dong X. A genomic approach to identify regulatory nodes in the transcriptional network of systemic acquired resistance in plants.PLoS Pathog. 2006; 2: e123https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.ppat.0020123Crossref PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar). The NPR1-dependency of these target genes was clearly demonstrated by their complete lack of responsiveness to SA treatment in the npr1 mutant (Figure 3D). Transformation of 35S::NPR1-GFP into the npr1 mutant restored the SA-mediated transcription of the WRKY genes. Whereas treatment with MG115 alone resulted in weak NPR1-dependent activation of the WRKY genes (Figure S6), the SA-mediated induction of these genes was strongly inhibited in the presence of MG115 (Figures 3D and S6), indicating that SA-induced transcription of these WRKY genes requires both NPR1 and the proteasome activity. SA-induced expression of PR-1, another NPR1 target (Wang et al., 2005Wang D. Weaver N.D. Kesarwani M. Dong X. Induction of protein secretory pathway is required for systemic acquired resistance.Science. 2005; 308: 1036-1040Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar), was only modestly affected by MG115 treatment (Figure S7), suggesting that its activation is less dependent on the proteasome. Since the NPR1-GFP transgene is constitutively expressed, independent of SA and MG115 (Figure S1), the observed reduction in NPR1 target gene expression was specifically due to the change in NPR1 protein stability, not expression. Because degradation of NPR1 requires CUL3 in uninduced plants, we examined its requirement for NPR1 degradation in SA-induced plants. Blocking protein synthesis with CHX in SA-treated wild-type plants strongly reduced endogenous NPR1 protein levels, whereas NPR1 levels remained constant in the cul3a cul3b mutant (Figure 4A). Moreover, the NPR1-GFP protein expressed in SA-treated wild-type plants was highly polyubiquitinylated (Figure 4B). This modification was significantly reduced in the cul3a cul3b mutant background (Figure 4B). To investigate the role of CUL3 in activation of NPR1-dependent gene transcription, we examined expression of the NPR1 targets in the cul3a cul3b mutant. SA-induced transcription of all three WRKY genes was partially compromised in this mutant (Figure 4C). Importantly, after SA treatment, the levels of gene expression in cul3a cul3b plants were comparable to those observed in wild-type plants treated with both SA and MG115 (Figure 4C), confirming the role of CUL3 in this proteasome-dependent gene expression. To examine the impact of impaired WRKY gene expression on SAR, we used the previously described wrky18 mutant (Wang et al., 2006Wang D. Amornsiripanitch N. Dong X. A genomic approach to identify regulatory nodes in the transcriptional network of systemic acquired resistance in plants.PLoS Pathog. 2006; 2: e123https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.ppat.0020123Crossref PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar) and generated a double mutant of the two closely related and likely redundant WRKY38 and WRKY62 genes. In wrky18 and wrky38 wrky62 mutants, NPR1-dependent SAR against Psm ES4326, triggered after local inoculation of avirulent P.s. pv. tomato (Pst) DC3000/ avrRpt2, was partially compromised (Figures 4D and 4E). Thus, NPR1-mediated activation of these WRKY genes is essential for induction of SAR. Because knocking out NPR1-target WRKY genes impairs SAR, we predicted that the cul3a cul3b mutant would also be defective in SAR due to the failure to fully induce these genes. Indeed, cul3a cul3b plants failed to activate SAR against Psm ES4326 (Figure 4F), even though it had higher levels of basal resistance against this pathogen due to elevated PR gene expression (Figure 2D). Taken together, these data suggest that SA-induced, CUL3-mediated turnover of the coactivator NPR1 may stimulate target gene transcription and is required for activation of SAR. Targeting substrates to the proteasome is often regulated by post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation. To examine if NPR1 is phosphorylated, we treated 35S::NPR1-GFP plants with or without SA, extracted total protein, and applied the extracts onto a column that specifically binds phospho-proteins (see Experimental Procedures). We found that NPR1-GFP could bind to the column as significant amounts of the protein were eluted, especially from extracts of SA-treated plants (Figure 5A). Indeed, using an antibody against phosphorylated serine/threonine residues, we found that SA treatment strongly increased the level of NPR1 phosphorylation (Figure 5B). NPR1 contains an N-terminal phosphodegron motif that is highly conserved among NPR1 orthologs in different plant species (Figure 5C). Phosphodegrons are degradation motifs found in many proteasome-regulated substrates, including IκB (Hayden and Ghosh, 2004Hayden M.S. Ghosh S.

To study if Ser11 and Ser15 of the IκB-like phosphodegron motif in NPR1 are phosphorylated in vivo, we generated an antibody that specifically recognizes phosphorylated Ser11/15 (Figure S8; see Experimental Procedures). Little Ser11/15 phosphorylation of the endogenous NPR1 and NPR1-GFP was observed in untreated plants, whereas SA treatment greatly enhanced phosphorylation (Figures 5D and 5E). Moreover, SA-induced Ser11/15 phosphorylation of NPR1 occurs in the nucleus, as this modification was completely abolished in the cytoplasmic npr1-nls-GFP mutant protein (Figure 5E). Since NPR1 phosphorylation and degradation both occur in the nucleus, we investigated if SA-induced phosphorylation of the IκB-like phosphodegron motif was coupled to NPR1 turnover. Ser11 and Ser15 of NPR1-GFP were replaced with nonphosphorylatable alanines (S11/15A) or phospho-mimic aspartic acids (S11/15D). The resulting 35S::npr1S11/15A-GFP and 35S::npr1S11/15D-GFP constructs were then transformed into npr1-2 plants. In a cell-free degradation assay, the npr1S11/15D-GFP protein showed an increased degradation rate as compared to both NPR1-GFP (not phosphorylated in the absence of an inducer) and npr1S11/15A-GFP (Figure 6A). To further investigate this, plants were treated with a combination of SA and MG115 and coimmunoprecipitation experiments were performed. As shown in Figure 6B, both the NPR1-GFP (phosphorylated in the presence of an inducer) and npr1S11/15D-GFP proteins were readily pulled down with CUL3A, whereas only a small amount of npr1S11/15A-GFP protein was recovered. Moreover, polyubiquitinylation of npr1S11/15A-GFP was markedly reduced compared to NPR1-GFP (Figure 6C). Thus, SA-induced phosphorylation of NPR1 facilitates its interaction with the CUL3-based ubiquitin ligase and stimulates turnover. To test our hypothesis that p"

Here, we introduce these substitutions into the endogenous Foxp2 gene of mice. Although these mice are generally healthy, they have qualitatively different ultrasonic vocalizations, decreased exploratory behavior and decreased dopamine concentrations in the brain suggesting that the humanized Foxp2 allele affects basal ganglia. In the striatum, a part of the basal ganglia affected in humans with a speech deficit due to a nonfunctional FOXP2 allele, we find that medium spiny neurons have increased dendrite lengths and increased synaptic plasticity. Since mice carrying one nonfunctional Foxp2 allele show opposite effects, this suggests that alterations in cortico-basal ganglia circuits might have been important for the evolution of speech and language in humans."
https://openalex.org/W1983813797,"Theta oscillations clock hippocampal activity during awake behaviour and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. These oscillations are prominent in the local field potential, and they also reflect the subthreshold membrane potential and strongly modulate the spiking of hippocampal neurons. The prevailing view is that theta oscillations are synchronized throughout the hippocampus, despite the lack of conclusive experimental evidence. In contrast, here we show that in freely behaving rats, theta oscillations in area CA1 are travelling waves that propagate roughly along the septotemporal axis of the hippocampus. Furthermore, we find that spiking in the CA1 pyramidal cell layer is modulated in a consistent travelling wave pattern. Our results demonstrate that theta oscillations pattern hippocampal activity not only in time, but also across anatomical space. The presence of travelling waves indicates that the instantaneous output of the hippocampus is topographically organized and represents a segment, rather than a point, of physical space. The hippocampus is a part of the brain involved in spatial navigation and episodic memory — where was I and when. Essential to this spatiotemporal encoding are 'place cells' that fire when an animal passes through a precise position in its environment and theta oscillations, brain impulses that act as an internal 4–10 Hz clock. It is widely assumed that theta oscillations are synchronized throughout the hippocampus, but work using multiple electrode arrays in running rats shows that not to be the case. Evgueniy Lubenov and Athanassios Siapas show that theta oscillations form waves that travel across the hippocampal circuit at 10 cm per second. Thus time in the hippocampus is organized topographically, resembling a series of local time zones. The findings imply that, at any given time, the hippocampus encodes an extended segment of the environment — not just a point in space. Theta oscillations are essential to temporal encoding in the hippocampus; they clock hippocampal activity during awake behaviour and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. Although these 4–10-Hz oscillations are widely believed to be synchronized throughout the hippocampus, they are now demonstrated to form waves that travel across the hippocampal circuit, making the organization of time in the hippocampus similar to that on Earth—a progression of local time zones."
https://openalex.org/W2038307665,"Recent functional MRI (fMRI) studies have demonstrated that there is an intrinsically organized default mode network (DMN) in the resting brain, primarily made up of the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) and the medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC). Several previous studies have found that the DMN is minimally disturbed during different resting-state conditions with limited cognitive demand. However, this conclusion was drawn from the visual inspection of the functional connectivity patterns within the DMN and no statistical comparison was performed.Four resting-state fMRI sessions were acquired: 1) eyes-closed (EC) (used to generate the DMN mask); 2) EC; 3) eyes-open with no fixation (EO); and 4) eyes-open with a fixation (EO-F). The 2-4 sessions were counterbalanced across participants (n = 20, 10 males). We examined the statistical differences in both functional connectivity and regional amplitude of low frequency fluctuation (ALFF) within the DMN among the 2-4 resting-state conditions (i.e., EC, EO, and EO-F). Although the connectivity patterns of the DMN were visually similar across these three different conditions, we observed significantly higher functional connectivity and ALFF in both the EO and the EO-F conditions as compared to the EC condition. In addition, the first and second resting EC conditions showed significant differences within the DMN, suggesting an order effect on the DMN activity.Our findings of the higher DMN connectivity and regional spontaneous activities in the resting state with the eyes open suggest that the participants might have more non-specific or non-goal-directed visual information gathering and evaluation, and mind wandering or daydreaming during the resting state with the eyes open as compared to that with the eyes closed, thus providing insights into the understanding of unconstrained mental activity within the DMN. Our results also suggest that it should be cautious when choosing the type of a resting condition and designating the order of the resting condition in multiple scanning sessions in experimental design."
https://openalex.org/W2133156861,"Alexithymia, or ""no words for feelings"", is a personality trait which is associated with difficulties in emotion recognition and regulation. It is unknown whether this deficit is due primarily to regulation, perception, or mentalizing of emotions. In order to shed light on the core deficit, we tested our subjects on a wide range of emotional tasks. We expected the high alexithymics to underperform on all tasks.Two groups of healthy individuals, high and low scoring on the cognitive component of the Bermond-Vorst Alexithymia Questionnaire, completed questionnaires of emotion regulation and performed several emotion processing tasks including a micro expression recognition task, recognition of emotional prosody and semantics in spoken sentences, an emotional and identity learning task and a conflicting beliefs and emotions task (emotional mentalizing).The two groups differed on the Emotion Regulation Questionnaire, Berkeley Expressivity Questionnaire and Empathy Quotient. Specifically, the Emotion Regulation Quotient showed that alexithymic individuals used more suppressive and less reappraisal strategies. On the behavioral tasks, as expected, alexithymics performed worse on recognition of micro expressions and emotional mentalizing. Surprisingly, groups did not differ on tasks of emotional semantics and prosody and associative emotional-learning.Individuals scoring high on the cognitive component of alexithymia are more prone to suppressive emotion regulation strategies rather than reappraisal strategies. Regarding emotional information processing, alexithymia is associated with reduced performance on measures of early processing as well as higher order mentalizing. However, difficulties in the processing of emotional language were not a core deficit in our alexithymic group."
https://openalex.org/W2097699811,"In 2005, a human adenovirus strain (formerly known as HAdV-D22/H8 but renamed here HAdV-D53) was isolated from an outbreak of epidemic keratoconjunctititis (EKC), a disease that is usually caused by HAdV-D8, -D19, or -D37, not HAdV-D22. To date, a complete change of tropism compared to the prototype has never been observed, although apparent recombinant strains of other viruses from species Human adenovirus D (HAdV-D) have been described. The complete genome of HAdV-D53 was sequenced to elucidate recombination events that lead to the emergence of a viable and highly virulent virus with a modified tropism. Bioinformatic and phylogenetic analyses of this genome demonstrate that this adenovirus is a recombinant of HAdV-D8 (including the fiber gene encoding the primary cellular receptor binding site), HAdV-D22, (the ε determinant of the hexon gene), HAdV-D37 (including the penton base gene encoding the secondary cellular receptor binding site), and at least one unknown or unsequenced HAdV-D strain. Bootscanning analysis of the complete genomic sequence of this novel adenovirus, which we have re-named HAdV-D53, indicated at least five recombination events between the aforementioned adenoviruses. Intrahexon recombination sites perfectly framed the ε neutralization determinant that was almost identical to the HAdV-D22 prototype. Additional bootscan analysis of all HAdV-D hexon genes revealed recombinations in identical locations in several other adenoviruses. In addition, HAdV-D53 but not HAdV-D22 induced corneal inflammation in a mouse model. Serological analysis confirmed previous results and demonstrated that HAdV-D53 has a neutralization profile representative of the ε determinant of its hexon (HAdV-D22) and the fiber (HAdV-D8) proteins. Our recombinant hexon sequence is almost identical to the hexon sequences of the HAdV-D strain causing EKC outbreaks in Japan, suggesting that HAdV-D53 is pandemic as an emerging EKC agent. This documents the first genomic, bioinformatic, and biological descriptions of the molecular evolution events engendering an emerging pathogenic adenovirus."

https://openalex.org/W2071129408,"Cytokinesis is accomplished by constriction of a cortical contractile ring. We show that during the early embryonic divisions in C. elegans, ring constriction occurs in two phases—an initial phase at a constant rate followed by a second phase during which the constriction rate decreases in proportion to ring perimeter. Cytokinesis completes in the same amount of time, despite the reduction in cell size during successive divisions, due to a strict proportionality between initial ring size and the constant constriction rate. During closure, the myosin motor in the ring decreases in proportion to perimeter without turning over. We propose a “contractile unit” model to explain how the ring retains a structural memory of its initial size as it disassembles.

In animal cells, cytokinesis is accomplished by constriction of a cortical contractile ring. Contractile rings are composed of a network of protein polymers that includes actin filaments, bipolar filaments of the motor myosin II, and septin filaments. Contractile rings also contain the crosslinker anillin, which binds directly to all three filament types, and proteins that regulate actin nucleation, capping, polymerization, disassembly, and crosslinking (Eggert et al., 2006Eggert U.S. Mitchison T.J.

Understanding the structural organization of the contractile ring and how it generates contractile stress is an important current challenge. Based on analogy to muscle, it has been proposed that contractile stress is generated via a “sliding filament” mechanism in which bipolar myosin filaments walk along actin filaments within organized sarcomere-like arrays (Schroeder, 1975Schroeder T.E. Dynamics of the contractile ring.in: Stephens R.E. Inoué S. Molecules and Cell Movement. Raven Press, New York1975: 305-334Google Scholar). The contractile ring has been examined by electron microscopy (EM) in a variety of experimental systems, including several marine invertebrates, newts, vertebrate cultured cells, fission yeast, and the single-celled ciliate Nassula (Schroeder, 1968Schroeder T.E.

However, organization of actin filaments into sarcomere-like arrays has not been reproducibly observed. In vitro studies and biophysical considerations have suggested two alternative mechanisms that would not require a sarcomere-like filament organization. In the first mechanism, myosin is proposed to generate contractile stress in the context of homogeneous bundles of actin filaments of random orientation (Takiguchi, 1991Takiguchi K.

In the second mechanism, contractile stress is proposed to arise from filament polymerization dynamics, in particular from actin filament depolymerization in the presence of end-tracking crosslinkers (Dogterom and Yurke, 1997Dogterom M.

Kruse K. Bringmann H. Hyman A. Jülicher F. Rutherford S. Stress generation and filament turnover during actin ring constriction.PLoS ONE. 2007; 2: e696Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). A second important question is what happens to the structure and components of the contractile ring as it constricts. In a classic EM study in sea urchin embryos, the volume of the actin filament network was found to decrease as constriction proceeded (Schroeder, 1972Schroeder T.E. The contractile ring. II. Determining its brief existence, volumetric changes, and vital role in cleaving Arbacia eggs.J. Cell Biol. 1972; 53: 419-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar), indicating that the actin filaments disassemble as the ring gets smaller. EM analysis in the fission yeast S. pombe provided additional support for the idea that actin filaments shorten during ring constriction (Kamasaki et al., 2007Kamasaki T. Osumi M. Mabuchi I. Three-dimensional arrangement of F-actin in the contractile ring of fission yeast.J. Cell Biol. 2007; 178: 765-771Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Analysis of GFP-tagged ring components in S. pombe has suggested that different contractile ring components have different fates—the total amount of the actin-associated proteins Rng2p, Cdc15p, Cdc12p, and Ain1p in the ring decreased in proportion to the decrease in ring circumference, whereas the total amount of myosin in the ring remained constant (Wu and Pollard, 2005Wu J.Q. Pollard T.D. Counting cytokinesis proteins globally and locally in fission yeast.Science. 2005; 310: 310-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar). Fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) studies on assembled rings in S. pombe revealed that Cdc4p (the myosin II essential light chain) and Cdc8p (the actin-associated protein tropomyosin) are both turning over rapidly (t1/2 = 20–30 s; Pelham and Chang, 2002Pelham R.J. Chang F. Actin dynamics in the contractile ring during cytokinesis in fission yeast.Nature. 2002; 419: 82-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). A similar half-time has also been observed for labeled actin in the contractile ring in vertebrate cultured cells (Murthy and Wadsworth, 2005Murthy K. Wadsworth P. Myosin-II-dependent localization and dynamics of F-actin during cytokinesis.Curr. Biol. 2005; 15: 724-731Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar, Guha et al., 2005Guha M. Zhou M. Wang Y. Cortical actin turnover during cytokinesis requires myosin II.Curr. Biol. 2005; 15: 732-736Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). These studies have led to the idea that contractile ring components turn over rapidly relative to the rate of constriction. A major goal of studies of the contractile ring is to incorporate information on structure and component dynamics into a biophysical model that recapitulates the kinetics of constriction. In S. pombe and the amoebic parasite E. invadens the contractile ring constricts at a constant rate, leading to a linear decrease in ring perimeter with time (Pelham and Chang, 2002Pelham R.J. Chang F. Actin dynamics in the contractile ring during cytokinesis in fission yeast.Nature. 2002; 419: 82-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar, Biron et al., 2004Biron D. Libros P. Sagi D.

During the first division of sea urchin and C. elegans embryos the contractile ring constricts at a constant rate for the majority (70%–90%) of constriction, after which the rate of constriction progressively slows (Mabuchi, 1994Mabuchi I.

Stress generation and filament turnover during actin ring constriction.PLoS ONE. 2007; 2: e696Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Attempts to generate a biophysical model that recapitulates a constant rate of closure have been based on different assumptions and have consequently led to substantially different ideas for how constriction may be achieved (Biron et al., 2005Biron D.

Bringmann H. Hyman A. Jülicher F. Rutherford S. Stress generation and filament turnover during actin ring constriction.PLoS ONE. 2007; 2: e696Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Here we explore the inherent properties of the contractile ring by monitoring the fate of ring components during constriction and investigating how constriction scales with respect to initial ring size in the C. elegans embryo. Our results establish that the contractile ring progressively disassembles while retaining a structural memory that renders constriction time independent of its initial size. This design principle explains how mitotic events and the duration of cytokinesis are coordinated when cell size varies during embryogenesis and in other biological contexts. We propose a “contractile unit” model that accounts for both the structural memory and the proportional decrease in ring components during constriction. To investigate how cytokinesis scales with cell size, we measured the kinetics of contractile ring closure during the first five divisions of the C. elegans embryo. Constriction was monitored in embryos coexpressing an RFPmCherry-labeled plasma membrane marker and a GFP fusion with the heavy chain of myosin II (NMY-2-GFP), which marks the contractile ring (Figures 1A and 1B). During the first two divisions (1→2 and 2→4 cells), the cells divide parallel to the imaging plane, providing a side view of the contractile ring (Figure 1C and see Movie S1 available online). Because the contractile ring is circular during these divisions, ring perimeter was calculated from the diameter measured from a z-series acquired at each time point (see Supplemental Data A). During the subsequent three divisions (4→8, 8→16, and 16→32 cells), one or more cells divide along an axis perpendicular to the imaging plane, providing an “end-on” view of the ring (Figure 1D and Movie S2). During these divisions, the contractile ring is not a perfect circle due to the presence of cell-cell contacts, so the perimeter was measured by tracing the outline of the ring. In the early embryo, cell volume decreases ∼2-fold during each sequential division; thus, the initial perimeter, measured prior to constriction onset, progressively decreases from ∼100 μm at the first division to ∼40 μm during the fifth division (Figure 1E). We compared ring closure profiles for the different divisions by monitoring constriction in embryos (n = 9–27) for each division and plotting mean ring perimeter versus time (Figure 1F and Supplemental Data A and B). Times were assigned relative to the initial deformation of the cortex, which was the first point when a recognizable ingression was evident. The ring closure plots revealed that the duration of constriction is invariant between divisions (Figures 1F and 1G), implying that the larger rings in the earlier divisions constrict more rapidly than the smaller rings in later divisions. Plotting the constriction rate versus perimeter (Figure 1H and Supplemental Data C) revealed that ring closure occurs in two phases—an initial phase at a constant constriction rate, followed by a second phase during which the constriction rate decreased in proportion to perimeter. During each successive division, the percentage of closure accomplished at a constant rate decreased, until by the fifth division, the constriction rate decreased in proportion to perimeter from the first point where it could be accurately measured (Figure 1H and Supplemental Data D). Thus, during at least the first four embryonic divisions, contractile ring constriction occurs in two phases whose relative contributions change as a function of the initial size of the ring. To characterize the transition between the two phases of cytokinesis, we calculated the mean constriction rate during the constant phase and fit the last 6 (1→2 and 2→4 cells) or 9 (4→8 and 8→16 cells) data points, during which the rate of constriction was declining, to a linear trend. We defined the transition point as the perimeter when the value of the linear equation was equal to the mean constant phase constriction rate (Figure 2A and Supplemental Data D). This analysis revealed that the transition occurred at a perimeter of ∼19 μm during all first four divisions (Figures 2A and 2B), indicating that it is controlled by a mechanism that is independent of initial ring size. One mechanism that could account for the size independence of the transition is proximity of the constricting ring to the spindle midzone, a set of microtubule bundles that forms between the separating chromosomes during anaphase. The dimensions of the spindle midzone are determined by the segregating chromosome masses and are independent of initial cell size. To test this idea, we monitored constriction kinetics after depleting SPD-1, a microtubule bundling protein that is required for midzone bundle formation but does not prevent ring constriction (Verbrugghe and White, 2004Verbrugghe K.J. White J.G. SPD-1 is required for the formation of the spindle midzone but is not essential for the completion of cytokinesis in C. elegans embryos.Curr. Biol. 2004; 14: 1755-1760Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar; Figure 2C). We chose the 4→8 cell stage because the transition occurs about halfway through constriction during this division. The transition from constant to decreasing closure rate did not occur in the SPD-1-depleted embryos, and the ring closed at a constant rate to completion (Figure 2D). These results indicate that the contractile ring has the potential to close at a constant rate to completion, but this intrinsic property is modulated when the spindle midzone is present. This explanation accounts for the differing relative contributions of the two phases: in large cells, the contractile ring closes at a constant rate for a larger percentage of constriction before encountering the midzone; as cell size decreases, the contractile ring forms in proximity to the spindle midzone, leading to constriction at a rate that decreases in proportion to perimeter soon after constriction onset (Figure 2E). The initial perimeter of the contractile ring is significantly greater during the early divisions than during the later divisions. By contrast, the time required for the ring to constrict from its initial perimeter to ∼5 μm was remarkably similar for all five divisions (Figure 1G). The basis for this property is evident when the constant phase constriction rate is plotted versus initial perimeter—a clear proportionality is observed (Figure 3A). In addition, the linear fit relating the constant constriction rate to initial perimeter passes through the origin. Thus, if contractile rings closed to completion at a constant rate, all rings would close in the same amount of time irrespective of their initial size (closure time = 1/α, where α is the slope of the plot in Figure 3A). However, due to the transition triggered by midzone proximity, contractile rings do not close to completion at a constant rate (Figure 2). The midzone-dependent transition has two effects. First, the overall duration of cytokinesis includes the duration of the second phase, ∼1.386PTP/αP0 (where P0 and PTP are the initial and transition perimeters, respectively; see Supplemental Data E for details), as well as that of the constant phase. Second, the duration of the constant phase is shortened to 1/α–PTP/αP0 because the rings constrict at a constant rate to the transition perimeter and not to completion. Because the duration of the second phase and the reduction in the duration of the constant phase are both ∼PTP/αP0, the time required to complete constriction differs only slightly from 1/α, which is what it would be if there were no midzone-dependent transition. Consequently, cytokinesis occurs in the same amount of time, independent of starting size. We note that because PTP/αP0 is inversely proportional to initial perimeter, the relative contributions of the two phases do change with cell size; bigger cells take longer to reach the transition point but progress from the transition point to 5 μm more quickly, whereas smaller cells reach the transition point more quickly but take longer to go from the transition point to 5 μm (Figure 2E). Our data indicate that the similar duration of cytokinesis is a consequence of the proportionality between the constant phase constriction rate and initial ring size. This inherent scalability of constant phase constriction is evident when the constriction rate per unit length is plotted versus decreasing perimeter for each division—the constriction rate per unit length progressively increases in proportion to the fold decrease in perimeter in a uniform fashion during all four divisions (Figure 3B). Cumulatively, these results indicate that initial ring size determines the constriction rate throughout closure. Thus, the ability to retain a structural memory of its initial size is a fundamental mechanical property of the contractile ring that allows it to generate a barrier between the separated chromosomes in a similar time frame despite significant differences in starting size. The constant phase constriction rate decreases in proportion to cell size during the first four embryonic divisions. However, developmental regulation or the presence of additional resistive forces resulting from the formation of new cell-cell contacts, instead of cell size, could underlie the observed scaling. To exclude these alternatives, we examined how constriction scales with respect to initial cell perimeter within the context of a single cell division—the ABa division at the four-cell stage. We experimentally altered ABa cell perimeter using RNAi of the gonad-specific anillin homolog ani-2, which broadens the size distribution for the brood of embryos laid by the treated worm (Maddox et al., 2005Maddox A.S. Habermann B. Desai A. Oegema K. Distinct roles for two C. elegans anillins in the gonad and the early embryo.Development. 2005; 132: 2837-2848Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Effectively, ani-2(RNAi) makes it possible to vary cell size, while keeping the developmental stage, cell geometry, and proportion of the surface in contact with other cells constant. The embryos laid by ani-2(RNAi) mothers were partitioned into three groups based on initial ABa cell perimeter, and the mean initial perimeter and mean constriction rate during the constant phase were determined for each group (Figures 3C–3E). This analysis revealed a linear proportionality between the constant phase constriction rate and initial cell perimeter that was very similar to that observed for the first four divisions in wild-type. These results strongly support the conclusion that the decrease in the constant closure rate during the first four embryonic divisions is due to the decrease in cell size. During the first phase of closure, constriction occurs at a constant rate as the ring decreases between 2-fold (16→32 cells) and 5-fold (1→2 cells) in size. To sustain the constant constriction rate, the constriction rate per unit length increases in proportion to the fold decrease in perimeter (Figure 3B). One mechanism to achieve this would be to keep the total amount of the motor-driving movement in the ring constant as the ring decreases in size, leading to an increase in motor concentration and in the amount of force the motor generates per unit length. To test whether such a mechanism was operating, we monitored the fate of myosin II (NMY-2) along with two other structural components of the ring—the septins (UNC-59) and anillin (ANI-1)—during constriction. We analyzed the amount of myosin, the septins, and anillin in the ring in the ABa cell at the 4→8 cell stage because ring constriction in this cell is partitioned evenly between the two phases, allowing the fate of components to be monitored during both phases. The NMY-2-GFP and GFP-UNC-59 fusions rescue mutations in the corresponding genes, confirming their functionality (Supplemental Data F and G); due to lack of a mutant, the functionality of the GFP-ANI-1 fusion has not been tested. During the ABa cell division, the contractile ring appears triangular, consisting of two “sides” where ABa contacts its two neighboring cells and a free circular arc that ingresses from the periphery toward the embryo center. All three probes concentrate in the contractile ring at the leading edge of the ingressing furrow. By contrast, the RFPmCherry probe, which is a fusion with a pleckstrin homology (PH) domain that binds to the phosphoinositide lipid PI4,5P2, is not enriched in the contractile ring (Figures 4A–4C and Movie S3). We quantified the fluorescence of each probe in the free arc throughout constriction (Figure 4D and Supplemental Data H). This analysis revealed that the GFP fluorescence per unit length remained constant during the majority of constriction for all three probes, with only a slight increase at the end, when the perimeter became smaller than 10 μm. This increase was most pronounced for GFP-anillin, which increased ∼1.3-fold in concentration as the ring perimeter decreased from ∼18 to 5 μm during the second phase of constriction. To increase the dynamic range over which constant rate constriction can be monitored, we repeated our analysis in spd-1(RNAi) embryos (Figure 2D) and found that the concentration of all three markers remained between 0.8-fold and 1.2-fold of the average value over a 5-fold change in perimeter, from 50 to 10 μm (Figure 4E). Measurement of contractile ring width (Supplemental Data I–K) and thickness (Supplemental Data L) indicated that they do not change during constriction. We conclude that the amount per unit length of the motor myosin II as well as two structural components (the septins and anillin) does not change during constant rate constriction even though the rate of closure per unit length increases. Thus, myosin, the septins, and anillin all behave in an essentially identical fashion, with the total amount of each component in the ring decreasing in proportion to the decrease in ring perimeter, indicating that constriction is coupled to progressive disassembly of the contractile ring. The total amount of myosin, septins, and anillin in the contractile ring decreases during constriction in proportion to the decrease in ring perimeter. This decrease could be achieved by incorporation into the ring during assembly and progressive loss during constriction or by rapid turnover in combination with a decrease in the number of binding sites as the ring gets smaller. To distinguish between these possibilities, we performed fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) experiments in strains expressing NMY-2-GFP (Figure 5 and Supplemental Data M) and GFP-UNC-59 (Supplemental Data N). We generated kymographs to monitor the fate of the bleached region for both markers and quantified the recovery of NMY-2-GFP by measuring the average GFP signal per unit length within a curved box of constant width that included the bleached and flanking unbleached areas (Figure 5C). If myosin and septins in the contractile ring were exchanging rapidly with the cytoplasmic or cortical pools, the GFP signal in the bleached region should rapidly recover along its entire length. Alternatively, if there were only constriction-coupled disassembly, the recovery should be slow and the bleached region should get progressively smaller as constriction proceeded. Kymographs of the bleached regions for both NMY-2-GFP (Figure 5B) and GFP-UNC-59 (Supplemental Data N) exhibited a tornado shape, indicating that the bleached regions do not recover uniformly along their entire length due to rapid exchange with cytoplasmic or cortical pools, but instead progressively fill in from their ends.

It is composed of the 20S core particle (CP) and the 19S regulatory particle (RP). The latter is further divided into the lid and base subcomplexes. While the mechanism involved in the assembly of the CP is well investigated, that of the RP is poorly understood. Here, we show that the formation of the mammalian base subcomplex involves three distinct modules, where specific pairs of ATPase subunits are associated with the distinct chaperones p28, S5b, or p27. The process of base formation starts from association of the p28-Rpt3-Rpt6-Rpn14 complex with the S5b-Rpt1-Rpt2-Rpn1 complex, followed by incorporation of the p27-Rpt5-Rpt4 complex and Rpn2, where p28, S5b, and p27 regulate the associations between the modules. These chaperones dissociate before completion of 26S proteasome formation. Our results demonstrate that base assembly is facilitated by multiple proteasome-dedicated chaperones, like CP assembly.

These chaperones dissociate before completion of 26S proteasome formation. Our results demonstrate that base assembly is facilitated by multiple proteasome-dedicated chaperones, like CP assembly. The 26S proteasome is a eukaryotic ATP-dependent protease responsible for the degradation of proteins tagged with polyubiquitin chains (Coux et al., 1996Coux O. Tanaka K. Goldberg A.L.

The ubiquitin-dependent proteolysis by the proteasome serves a diverse array of cellular processes including cell-cycle regulation, DNA repair, apoptosis, signal transduction, and protein quality control by catalyzing selective degradation of short-lived regulatory proteins and damaged proteins (Ravid and Hochstrasser, 2008Ravid T.

The 26S proteasome is a large protein complex composed of the catalytic 20S core particle (CP; also called the 20S proteasome) and the 19S regulatory particle (RP; also called PA700 in mammals), which is attached to either or both ends of the CP. The CP is a cylindrical shaped stack of four heptameric rings, where the outer rings and inner rings are each composed of seven homologous α subunits (α1–α7) and seven homologous β subunits (β1–β7), respectively (Baumeister et al., 1998Baumeister W. Walz J. Zuhl F. Seemuller E. The proteasome: paradigm of a self-compartmentalizing protease.Cell. 1998; 92: 367-380Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1273) Google Scholar). The proteolytic active sites reside within the central chamber enclosed by the two inner β rings while a small channel formed by the outer α ring, which is primarily closed, restricts access of most native proteins to the catalytic chamber. Appending the RP to the α rings confers ubiquitin- and ATP-dependent protein degradation activity on the 26S proteasome. The RP consists of 19 different subunits and can be divided into two subcomplexes, the base and the lid (Glickman et al., 1998Glickman M.H. Rubin D.M. Coux O. Wefes I. Pfeifer G. Cjeka Z.

The base is composed of six different homologous AAA-ATPase subunits, Rpt1–Rpt6, and three non-ATPase subunits, Rpn1, Rpn2, and Rpn13, although it is also proposed that Rpn13 is not a regular subunit and dynamically interacts with Rpn2 (Hamazaki et al., 2006Hamazaki J.

Three of the base subunits, Rpn1, Rpn13, and Rpt5, as well as Rpn10, which is assumed to sit at the interface of the lid and the base, capture ubiquitinated proteins either directly or indirectly. The lid is composed of nine non-ATPase subunits, Rpn3, Rpn5–9, Rpn11–12, and Rpn15 (also called Sem1 in yeast and DSS1 in mammals), where the metalloisopeptidase Rpn11 plays an essential role in deubiquitination of captured substrates (Verma et al., 2002Verma R.

The molecular mechanism involved in the assembly of such an elaborate machine remains a mystery. Recent studies have described in detail the mechanisms of the CP assembly, a process supported by multiple proteasome-dedicated chaperones such as PAC1-4 and UMP1/POMP in mammals and Pba1–4 and Ump1 in yeast (Kusmierczyk and Hochstrasser, 2008Kusmierczyk A.R.

In contrast to the considerable information on the assembly mechanism and structure of the CP, little is known about the arrangement and assembly of the RP (Murata et al., 2009Murata S. Yashiroda H. Tanaka K. Molecular mechanisms of proteasome assembly.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2009; 10: 104-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar). However, some extrinsic molecules that associate with certain subunits of the base subcomplex have been identified in mammalian cells, including p28, S5b, and p27. p28, also known as gankyrin, is a 25 kDa protein of 266 amino acids with six ankyrin repeats that was originally discovered as a subunit of the RP (Hori et al., 1998Hori T. Kato S. Saeki M. DeMartino G.N. Slaughter C.A. Takeuchi J. Toh-e A.

Subsequent studies indicated that p28 and its yeast homolog Nas6 are not authentic RP subunits; rather, p28/Nas6 is one of the proteasome-interacting proteins that associates with the RP transiently (Dawson et al., 2002Dawson S. Apcher S. Mee M. Higashitsuji H. Baker R. Uhle S. Dubiel W. Fujita J. Mayer R.J. Gankyrin is an ankyrin-repeat oncoprotein that interacts with CDK4 kinase and the S6 ATPase of the 26 S proteasome.J.

At the same time, it has been reported that p28 binds to MDM2 ubiquitin ligase and enhances the degradation of two important tumor suppressors, pRb and p53, presumably by recruiting these molecules in the vicinity of the proteasome, thus suggesting an oncogenic potential of p28 (Dawson et al., 2006Dawson S.

S5b, a 56 kDa protein of 504 amino acids, was initially identified as a component of the 26S proteasome purified from human red blood cells (Deveraux et al., 1995Deveraux Q. Jensen C. Rechsteiner M.

It forms a tetramer with Rpt1, Rpt2, and Rpn1 in vitro (Richmond et al., 1997Richmond C. Gorbea C. Rechsteiner M. Specific interactions between ATPase subunits of the 26 S protease.J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13403-13411Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), but its function in the proteasome is totally unknown. Like p28, it is reasonable to regard S5b as a proteasome-interacting protein since it was not found or was detected only in small amounts compared with the integral subunits in proteomics analyses of mammalian 26S proteasomes (Gomes et al., 2006Gomes A.V.

Chem. 1996; 271: 3112-3118Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). The modulator complex is composed of p27, Rpt4, and Rpt5 and is considered to enhance the association between the RP and the CP (Adams et al., 1997Adams G.M. Falke S. Goldberg A.L. Slaughter C.A. DeMartino G.N. Gogol E.P. Structural and functional effects of PA700 and modulator protein on proteasomes.J. Mol.

In this study, beginning with proteomics analysis, we characterized the above three proteasomal ATPase-interacting proteins in mammalian cells. The combination of small interfering RNA (siRNA)-mediated knockdown and biochemical approaches uncovered their roles as molecular chaperones that regulate the assembly of the base subcomplex of the mammalian proteasome. Although originally identified as proteasome-associated proteins, the functional relevance of p28, S5b, and p27 to the proteasome is poorly understood. Since deletion of Nas6 and Nas2, yeast orthologs of mammalian p28 and p27, respectively, did not result in any obvious defect in proteasome function at least under normal conditions (Dawson et al., 2002Dawson S.

UCH37 precipitated all subsets of proteasome subunits, including subunits of the CP and the RP, illustrating that it plays a role in the context of the 26S proteasome (Table S1 available online). We also found that p28, S5b, and p27 predominantly coprecipitated proteasome subunits, suggesting that these molecules are basically specialized for proteasomes (Table S1). However, unlike UCH37, they precipitated only a restricted subset of the proteasome subunits. p28 with C-terminal Flag tag and S5b almost exclusively coprecipitated the RP subunits but did not coprecipitate any of the CP subunits. Furthermore, p28 with an N-terminal tag pulled down only two specific ATPase subunits,Rpt3 and Rpt6, together with PAAF1 (proteasomal ATPase-associated factor 1), which is likely the human homolog of the yeast Rpn14 (hereafter we refer to it as Rpn14) and has been reported to associate with certain ATPase subunits of the base and to inhibit RP-CP interactions when overexpressed in HeLa cells (Park et al., 2005Park Y. Hwang Y.P. Lee J.S. Seo S.H. Yoon S.K. Yoon J.B. Proteasomal ATPase-associated factor 1 negatively regulates proteasome activity by interacting with proteasomal ATPases.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 3842-3853Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). p27 also precipitated specifically Rpt4 and Rpt5, irrespective of the tag position. These findings suggest that these three molecules play their roles in the context of the RP, and more specifically, the base subcomplex with respect to p28 and p27. To examine the size distribution of p28, S5b, and p27, we separated extracts from HEK293T cells by 8%–32% glycerol gradient centrifugation. None of the three molecules nor Rpn14 was detected in the 26S proteasome fraction (Figure 1A, fraction 26), consistent with the results of mass spectrometric analysis (Table S1). Rather, they were distributed in the light fractions, where small portions of the base subunits were also distributed (Figure 1A, fractions 4–12). To test whether p28, S5b, and p27 are associated with proteasome subunits in these light fractions, we subjected extracts from cells stably expressing Flag-tagged p28, S5b, or p27 to fractionation by low-density (4%–24%) glycerol gradient centrifugation to better resolve the light fractions. The distribution patterns of exogenously expressed p28, S5b, and p27 were essentially similar to those of endogenous proteins, ranging from fraction 4 to fraction 16 (Figures 1B–1D; see also below). These fractions were immunoprecipitated with anti-Flag antibody, followed by immunoblotting for proteasome subunits and Rpn14. p28 coprecipitated specifically with Rpt3 and Rpt6 as well as Rpn14 but neither with other base subunits nor with lid subunits in fractions 8–12 (Figure 1B). Although we do not know the exact stoichiometries of p28, Rpn14, Rpt3, and Rpt6 in this complex or whether some other nonproteasomal factors are associated with this complex, the sedimentation rate matches the deduced size of 160 kDa of the tetrameric complex of p28, Rpn14, Rpt3, and Rpt6, which is supported by the peak location of a 158 kDa size marker at fraction 10. Likewise, S5b formed a complex with Rpt1, Rpt2, and Rpn1 at fractions 12–16, consistent with the heterotetrameric complex of these proteins with its deduced size of 250 kDa as revealed by the peak location of a 232 kDa marker at fraction 13 (Figure 1C). p27 also specifically associated with Rpt4 and Rpt5 with its peak at fraction 8, which is consistent with the trimeric complex formation of p27, Rpt4, and Rpt5, whose deduced size is approximately 120 kDa (Figure 1D). Accordingly, Rpn2 is the only base subunit not included in any of these complexes. These data indicate that each ATPase subunit of the base subcomplex is paired with a particular ATPase subunit in a combination of Rpt3 and Rpt6, Rpt1 and Rpt2, or Rpt4 and Rpt5, which is further associated with a specific proteasome-dedicated molecule as well as a non-ATPase subunit, p28 and Rpn14, S5b and Rpn1, or p27, respectively. Thus, the base subunits with the exception of Rpn2 form distinct small modules before the formation of the base subcomplexes. To examine protein-protein interactions within the modules, we cotranslated molecules of interest in the presence of [35S] methionine and used the resulting radiolabeled proteins in binding assays. p28 was associated strongly with Rpt3 among the ATPase subunits (Figure 2A, left), while Rpt3 was specifically associated with Rpt6 and vice versa (Figure 2A, two middle panels). Rpn14 interacted most notably with Rpt6 (Figure 2A, right), thus enabling the formation of the p28-Rpt3-Rpt6-Rpn14 complex (the p28 module). S5b was bound strongly to Rpt1 among the ATPase subunits (Figure 2B, left). Rpt2 appeared to bridge between the Rpt1 and Rpn1 because Rpt2 was directly associated with both Rpt1 and Rpn1 while Rpt1 interacted with Rpt2 (Figure 2B, middle and right), which accounts for the formation of the S5b-Rpt1-Rpt2-Rpn1 complex (the S5b module). On the other hand, p27 directly associated with Rpt5 while Rpt4 and Rpt5 specifically interacted with each other (Figure 2C), resulting in the formation of the p27-Rpt5-Rpt4 complex (the p27 module). Although we detected several other weak interactions not mentioned above, which may or may not be significant, the above in vitro analyses essentially verify the specific complex formation of the base subunits observed in mammalian cells (Figure 1) and illustrate the basis for the organization of the three modules. To explore the rationale for such specific pair or trio formations of the base subunits, we knocked down each base subunit as well as the lid subunit Rpn3, and the cell extracts were subjected to immunoblot analysis (Figure 3A). Knockdown of Rpt1, Rpt2, or Rpn1 resulted in reduction in the two other base subunits of the S5b module, although the decrease in Rpn1 was modest compared to those in Rpt1 and Rpt2 in Rpt2- and Rpt1-knockdown cells, respectively. Likewise, knockdown of Rpt3 and Rpt6 led to a decrease in Rpt6 and Rpt3, respectively; knockdown of Rpt4 and Rpt5 caused a decrease in Rpt5 and Rpt4, respectively. In these cells, expression levels of mRNA transcripts for the base subunits were not decreased, but rather increased (Figure S1), consistent with the previous observation that proteasome dysfunction activates proteasomal gene expression (Meiners et al., 2003Meiners S. Heyken D. Weller A. Ludwig A. Stangl K. Kloetzel P.M. Kruger E. Inhibition of proteasome activity induces concerted expression of proteasome genes and de novo formation of Mammalian proteasomes.J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 21517-21525Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). This suggests decreased protein stabilities of unpaired base subunits. In contrast, knockdown of Rpn2, which is not included in any of the three modules, did not significantly affect the expression levels of the other base subunits. Knockdown of Rpn3 did not influence the base subunits, including Rpn2, supporting the previous notion that the lid and the base are assembled independently (Isono et al., 2007Isono E. Nishihara K. Saeki Y. Yashiroda H. Kamata N. Ge L. Ueda T. Kikuchi Y. Tanaka K. Nakano A. et al.The assembly pathway of the 19S regulatory particle of the yeast 26S proteasome.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2007; 18: 569-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Intriguingly, Rpn10 was decreased in the absence of either base subunits or a lid subunit, suggesting that Rpn10 is stabilized only when both the base and the lid are integral. p28, S5b, and p27 were not affected by loss of the base subunits (Figure 3A). These data demonstrate that knockdown of a base subunit causes reduction in its partner subunit within the module and suggest that the formation of the modules is necessary for stable expression of the base subunits before the assembly of the base subcomplex, where the presence of the proteasome-dedicated molecules p28, S5b, and p27 is not sufficient for the stability of the base subunits. To examine the influence of loss of each base subunit in detail, we separated the knockdown lysates shown in Figure 3A by native-PAGE, followed by immunoblotting (Figures 3B–3J). Knockdown of each of Rpt1, Rpt2 or Rpn1, which caused disruption of the S5b module, exhibited essentially the same phenotype; these cells showed accumulation of complexes of similar size that included subunits of the other two intact modules, i.e., Rpt3, Rpt4, Rpt5, and Rpt6 (Figures 3D–3G). Knockdown of Rpt3 and Rpt6, subunits of the p28 module, also resulted in accumulation of a complex of similar size and similar subunit composition that included Rpt1, Rpt2, Rpn1, Rpt4, and Rpt5, which are the subunits of the other two modules (Figures 3B, 3C, 3E, 3F, and 3H). Knockdown of Rpt4 and Rpt5, subunits of the p27 module, caused accumulation of a complex containing Rpt1, Rpt2, Rpn1, Rpt3, and Rpt6, again subunits of the other two modules (Figures 3B–3D, 3G, and 3H). In these knockdowns, Rpn2 appeared as two bands of fast-migrating species; the slower one was likely associated with Rpn13 (Figures 3I and S2). These results suggest that each module behaves as a group during base formation and that preceding association of the three modules is required for efficient incorporation of Rpn2 during the base assembly. However, a portion of the complex that accumulated in Rpt4- and Rpt5-knockdown cells appeared to include Rpn2, suggesting that Rpn2 could be incorporated to some extent in the absence of Rpt4 and Rpt5 (Figure 3I). Loss of Rpn2 caused accumulation of a complex that included all the ATPase subunits and Rpn1, indicating that Rpn2 is not a prerequisite for assembly involving the three modules (Figures 3B–3H), although it is also possible that Rpn2 affects the efficiency of the association among the three modules. Knockdown of Rpn3 caused accumulation of the base subcomplex as revealed by detection of all the base subunits, although the presence of Rpn2 was obscure in the native-PAGE analysis (Figure 3I). On the other hand, the amount of free lid subcomplex that was not associated with the base subcomplex, which was already visible in control cells, increased after knockdown of the base subunits, suggesting that the lid subcomplex efficiently binds to the complete base, further supporting the previous observation that the formation of the base and lid occurs independently (Isono et al., 2007Isono E. Nishihara K. Saeki Y. Yashiroda H. Kamata N. Ge L. Ueda T. Kikuchi Y. Tanaka K. Nakano A. et al.The assembly pathway of the 19S regulatory particle of the yeast 26S proteasome.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2007; 18: 569-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) (Figure 3J). Although native-PAGE analysis provides qualitative information about the nature of the accumulated complex, it does not provide reliable quantitative data. For example, the 26S proteasome (observed in control cells) and the base subcomplex (observed in Rpn3-knockdown cells) should include the base subunits with similar stoichiometry, whereas some antibodies (anti-"

The cyclotides are a family of topologically unique macrocyclic peptides abundant in plants of the Rubiaceae (coffee) and Violaceae (violet) families. They possess unusual structural and biophysical properties and are composed of a head-to-tail cyclic backbone and a cystine knot (1Craik D.J. Daly N.L. Mulvenna J. Plan M.R. Trabi M. Curr. Protein Pept. Sci. 2004; 5: 297-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). The cystine knot is formed by a disulfide bond that penetrates a ring made by two other disulfide bonds and their connecting backbone segments. The structure of kalata B1, the prototypic cyclotide, is illustrated in Fig. 1 (2Craik D.J. Toxicon. 2001; 39: 1809-1813Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar).

Cyclotides have been postulated to be defense-related proteins on the basis of their pesticidal activity and the suite of natural isoforms present in individual plants (20Plan M.R. Göransson U. Clark R.J. Daly N.L. Colgrave M.L. Craik D.J. Chem. Bio. Chem. 2007; 8: 1001-1011Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Little is known about their mechanism of action, but their observed activities potentially might be associated with membrane interactions. Studies utilizing analytical ultracentrifugation (21Nourse A. Trabi M. Daly N.L. Craik D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 562-570Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) have shown that the cyclotide kalata B2 forms specific oligomers in solution, which could potentially have a role in the formation of membrane-spanning pores. A membrane-based mechanism of action is supported by a recent surface plasmon resonance study, which demonstrated that several kalata-like cyclotides bind to phosphatidylethanolamine-containing membranes (22Kamimori H. Hall K. Craik D.J. Aguilar M.I. Anal. Biochem. 2005; 337: 149-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). More recently, the cyclotide cycloviolacin O2 was shown to be cytotoxic to a human lymphoma cell line and induce leakage of calcein-loaded HeLa cells (23Svangård E. Burman R. Gunasekera S. Lövborg H. Gullbo J. Göransson U. J. Nat. Prod. 2007; 70: 643-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). NMR studies showed that the binding of kalata B1, and other analogues, to dodecylphosphocholine micelles is modulated by both electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions (24Shenkarev Z.O. Nadezhdin K.D. Sobol V.A. Sobol A.G. Skjeldal L. Arseniev A.S. FEBS J. 2006; 273: 2658-2672Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 25Shenkarev Z.O. Nadezhdin K.D. Lyukmanova E.N. Sobol V.A. Skjeldal L. Arseniev A.S. J. Inorg. Biochem. 2008; 102: 1246-1256Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Although these findings indicate that cyclotides interact with a wide range of membranes, with incorporation of the cyclotide structure into monolayers (micelles), and result in leakage of cellular contents from bilayers (HeLa cells), a functional study of cyclotide-membrane interactions is to date lacking. In the present study, the membrane-binding ability of prototypic cyclotide kalata B1 is delineated, and the mechanism of action is defined. For the first time we show that cyclotides form pores with channel-like activities in membranes. Dye leakage experiments indicate that kalata B1 induces membrane permeability, and electrophysiological measurements provide unequivocal evidence of pore formation, probably involving the insertion of oligomers of kalata B1 into the lipid bilayers. The results indicate that the diverse range of biological activities reported for cyclotides can be accounted for by membrane permeabilization associated with transmembrane pores with channel-like activity. Native kalata B1 was isolated from the above ground parts of Oldenlandia affinis and purified as described previously (4Craik D.J. Daly N.L. Bond T. Waine C. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 294: 1327-1336Crossref PubMed Scopus (644) Google Scholar). The concentration of the peptide was determined spectrophotometrically using an extinction coefficient of 5875 m−1 cm−1 at 280 nm. Alanine mutants of kalata B1 were synthesized using solid-phase methods as previously described (26Daly N.L. Craik D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19068-19075Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Briefly, the peptides were assembled using manual solid-phase peptide synthesis with t-butoxycarbonyl chemistry. Amino acids were added to the resin using 2-(1-H-benzotriazol-1-yl)-1,1,3,3-tetramethyluronium hexafluorophosphate with in situ neutralization. Cleavage of the peptides from the resin was achieved using hydrogen fluoride with p-cresol and p-thiocresol as scavengers (9:0.8:0.2 v/v, HF:cresol:thiocresol). The crude reduced peptides were purified on a Phenomenex C18 column. Gradients of 0.05% aqueous trifluoroacetic acid and 90% acetonitrile, 0.045% trifluoroacetic acid were employed with a flow rate of 8 ml/min, and the eluant was monitored at 230 nm. These conditions were used in subsequent purification steps. Cyclization and oxidation of the mutants were performed by dissolving the peptides in 50/50 (v/v) 0.1 m ammonium bicarbonate (pH 8)/isopropanol (0.5 mg/ml). The mixture was stirred at room temperature overnight and then purified by reversed phase-high performance liquid chromatography. Correctly folded mutants were identified by their late elution under reversed phase conditions, and 1H NMR spectra confirmed the folded states. All peptides were characterized using electrospray ionization mass spectrometry, and the purity was checked with analytical high performance liquid chromatography. As reported earlier (18Simonsen S.M. Sando L. Rosengren K.J. Wang C.K. Colgrave M.L. Daly N.L. Craik D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 9805-9813Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar), the Trp-23 and Pro-24 mutants did not fold under the folding conditions used for the other mutants. Additional folding trials confirmed that the Trp-23 mutant could be folded with the addition of 1 mm glutathione to the folding buffer. The folding of W23A was confirmed using NMR spectra: the αH shifts of W23A mirrored those of the native peptide (supplemental Fig. S1A). The P24A mutant was insoluble, presumably because of incorrect folding, and was not further examined. A hemolytic assay was conducted on mutant W23A using a method similar to that described previously (18Simonsen S.M. Sando L. Rosengren K.J. Wang C.K. Colgrave M.L. Daly N.L. Craik D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 9805-9813Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar) for the other mutants. Data for the other Ala mutants were available from the previous study. Human erythrocytes were separated from serum with repeated centrifugation at 4000 rpm in phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.4). A pellet of erythrocytes was resuspended to a 0.25% (v/v) solution. Stock solutions of the peptide were prepared at 300 μm then serially diluted in triplicates and were aliquoted into a 96-well plate. 100 μl of the 0.25% erythrocyte solution was dispensed into each well and incubated with diluted peptide solution at 37 °C for 1 h. The 96-well plate was centrifuged to pellet the intact red blood cells, and the supernatant of each well was measured by visual absorption spectroscopy at 415 nm. Vesicles were prepared as described previously (27Rex S. Biophys. Chem. 1996; 58: 75-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). The standard buffer was composed of 10 mm HEPES (from Sigma-Aldrich), 107 mm NaCl, 1 mm Na2EDTA·2H2O, and ∼5–6 mm NaOH to adjust the pH to 7.4. The fluorescent dye 5-carboxyfluorescein (CF) 4The abbreviations used are: CFcarboxyfluoresceinPOPC1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphatidylcholinePOPG1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-[phospho-rac-(1-glycerol)]POPE1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphatidylethanolamineSMsphingomyelin. was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich.

Lipids were stored under nitrogen at −20 °C to prevent oxidation. Lipid concentrations were determined by the Stewart assay (28Stewart J.C. Anal. Biochem. 1980; 104: 10-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (1535) Google Scholar). Dry lipid was dispersed in the standard buffer (in the absence or presence of dye) by vortex mixing, followed by sonication at 25 °C under nitrogen for 45 min. The liposome solutions were then sized 19 times by extrusion through two stacked 100 nm Nucleopore polycarbonate membranes (Avanti Polar Lipids). Vesicles loaded with CF were separated from non-entrapped dye on a Sephadex G-50 column (Amersham Biosciences). Several membrane systems were prepared, including vesicles composed of a single phospholipid (POPC or POPG), as well as vesicles with a mixed phospholipid composition POPC/POPE/SM/cholesterol (2:2:3:1) to imitate the outer membranes of human erythrocyte (29Yeaman M.R. Yount N.Y. Pharmacol. Rev. 2003; 55: 27-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (2333) Google Scholar). Two other analogue lipid systems lacking either cholesterol (POPC/POPE/SM) or sphingomyelin (POPC/POPE/cholesterol) were also examined against kalata B1. The vesicles were diluted to a lipid concentration of 100 μm with standard buffer before addition of peptide. Preliminary fluorescence emission spectra were measured between 460 and 600 nm on a PerkinElmer Life Sciences luminescence spectrometer with a scan speed of 140 nm/min. An excitation wavelength of 480 nm and a quartz cuvette with an optical path width of 4 mm were used. The excitation and emission slit widths were set to 4 nm. Experiments were performed at 25 °C. The initial fluorescence signal, Fo (when cells/vesicles are intact, i.e. no leakage), was measured, and each run was started by the addition of 50 μl of a peptide solution. Fluorescence spectra were measured every minute for 20 min before the addition of 1% (v/v) Triton X-100 solution, whereby the vesicles are completely lysed giving rise to the formation of mixed micelles and yielding a fluorescence signal of maximum intensity, Fx. Control experiments were conducted with the addition of Milli Q H2O only. A miniaturized version of the assay was set up using a 96-well plate format. Vesicles were prepared as described above and were aliquoted into the wells. The test peptides were added to each well, thoroughly mixed by pipette aspiration, and incubated at room temperature for a minimum of 20 min prior to fluorescence measurements. The fluorescence intensity of the released CF solutions was read using an Envision 2102 Multilabel Reader with excitation at 485 nm and emission at 528 nm. All experiments were conducted in triplicate, and controls with H2O alone (spontaneous dye release) were used. Following measurement of dye release from vesicles incubated with cyclotide, Triton X-100 was added, and the fluorescence was measured to obtain Fx. Starting with a self-quenching concentration of CF (50 mm) inside the vesicles, leakage of the dye resulting from incubation of the vesicles with cyclotides was detected as an increase in fluorescence intensity, due to dilution below self-quenching concentrations. The spontaneous leakage of CF in the absence of peptide was found to be negligible. From the observed fluorescence during the measurement period, a normalized efflux function (30Schwarz G. Robert C.H. Biophys. J. 1990; 58: 577-583Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 31Schwarz G. Robert C.H. Biophys. Chem. 1992; 42: 291-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) that describes the efflux over the period of the experiment was determined according to:E(t)=Fx-F(t)Fx-F0(Eq. 1) where F(t) is the measured fluorescence at time t, Fo is the initial fluorescence before addition of peptide, and Fx is the final fluorescence after addition of 1% (v/v) Triton X-100. The leakage of a dye (which varies between 0 and 100%) was calculated according to the equation (27Rex S. Biophys. Chem. 1996; 58: 75-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar), % Leakage = (1 − E(t)) × 100. Leakage of aqueous vesicle contents to the external medium was monitored using the CF assay, by the addition of varying amounts of the cyclotide kalata B1 from a stock solution to unilamellar vesicle suspensions. POPC/POPE/cholesterol (5:3:2) vesicles were prepared in standard buffer (no dye) or in standard buffer containing dye. A series of kalata B1 solutions was prepared via serial dilution, and these were preincubated with the dye-free vesicles (no CF) for 30 min at 25 °C. The mixture was then incubated with CF-entrapped vesicles to give a 50:50 mixture of dye-free:dye-containing vesicles prior to measuring the fluorescence intensity. In parallel, solutions of the same peptide concentrations were incubated with a 50:50 mixture of dye-free and dye-containing vesicles, i.e. no preincubation period, before measuring their fluorescence intensity. Liposomes were formed from asolectin (soybean lecithin, Sigma) based on a procedure described previously (32Häse C.C. Le Dain A.C. Martinac B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18329-18334Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar, 33Martinac B. Hamill O.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2002; 99: 4308-4312Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). The asolectin contained several carbon chains, 60% of which were comprised by 18:2. Briefly, 2 mg of the asolectin was dissolved in chloroform (Sigma-Aldrich), evaporated, and dried under a nitrogen jet for 15 min. To achieve a 10 mg/ml solution in final concentration, the thin layer of lipid was then dispersed in 200 μl of dehydration/rehydration buffer (D/R buffer, 200 mm KCl/5 mm HEPES/KOH, pH 7.2) by vortex mixing, followed by sonication for 5–15 min at room temperature to obtain a cloudy liquid. The liquid was transferred to a 15-ml centrifuge tube (diluted to 3 ml) and placed on a platform rocker for 3 h at room temperature. The solution was spun for 30 min at 90,000 rpm at 4 °C (TL-100 Ultracentrifuge, Beckman) to obtain a pellet of liposome. The pellet (2 mg of asolectin) was resuspended in 40 μl of D/R buffer and two of 10-μl (0.5 mg) aliquots were spotted onto an ethanol-cleaned slide. The spots were then dehydrated and desiccated under vacuum overnight and rehydrated on the next day for at least 6 h. Excised liposome patches were used for these experiments. The liposome spot was rehydrated with 10 μl of D/R buffer on the day before the operation of patch clamping. For patch clamping, 10 μl of D/R buffer was used to disperse a quarter of the liposome spot that had been rehydrated overnight and transferred to a chamber containing 700 μl of recording solution (D/R buffer with additional 40 mm MgCl2, pH 7.2). Clear blisters were observed to form within 15 min of plating under an optical phase-contrast microscope for imaging low contrast, transparent samples such as blisters of monolayer. Channel currents were recorded by using borosilicate micropipettes with a bubble number of 3.2 to 2.6, which corresponds to a resistance of 4–6 MΩ with recording solution in the pipette and bath. A seal was formed on the pipette tip directly after the pipette contacted the surface of the blister or alternatively after a light suction was applied. To prevent the free ends of the patch resealing, the pipette was lifted to pass through the air interface quickly. The patch current signal was amplified, filtered (1 kHz), and digitized at 5 kHz with a computer using software PCLAMP9. Different concentrations of either the kalata B1, the inactive V25A-kB1 mutant, or the active T20A-kB1 mutants were placed in the pipette solution in separate experiments. The potassium present in the normal recording solution was substituted separately with an equimolar concentration of sodium or the large cation, N-methyl-d-glucamine, to assess the cation-selective properties of the channel-like pores that kalata B1 induced in asolectin liposomes. Phospholipid vesicles have been used extensively to investigate the properties of biological membranes and their interactions with ligands. Fluorescence spectroscopy is a sensitive technique that detects binding ability and membrane perturbation by measuring the release of fluorescent dyes from vesicles. In the current study, vesicles were loaded with a self-quenching fluorescent dye, CF, as a probe to monitor vesicle leakage. At high concentrations, i.e. within the vesicle, the fluorescence intensity is weak due to self-quenching; however, upon pore formation or other disruption of the lipid bilayer, the dilution of the fluorophore results in an increase in fluorescence intensity, which can be measured over time. This approach was used to investigate cyclotide-induced leakage of a self-quenching dye from a variety of lipid systems. The first leakage experiment used zwitterionic vesicles composed of 100% POPC (16:0–18:1). The phosphatidylcholine headgroup is a major component of biological membranes. To evaluate potential electrostatic interactions of kalata B1, the anionic phospholipid POPG was used in other experiments. Fig. 2A shows the time course for a typical efflux measurement from a POPC vesicle solution for which the background fluorescence was measured before the addition of kalata B1 at t = 0 min. Subsequent measurements were taken at 1-min intervals for 20 min, after which 1% (v/v) Triton X-100 was added. Triton addition corresponded with complete lysis of the membrane, and thus 100% leakage of the vesicle contents. The fluorescence maximum occurred at 518 nm. The fluorescence data were converted to efflux values, E(t), and subsequently to percentage leakage values. Fig. 2B shows a time course of the fluorescence signal during an efflux measurement from POPC vesicles for four cyclotide concentrations. Leakage occurred rapidly, with >50% of the total fluorescence intensity observed after 1 min, followed by a gradual increase in fluorescence for up to 10 min. At any given cyclotide concentration, leakage was effectively complete after 10 min, and so the CF fluorescence intensity 20 min after peptide addition was used as a measure of the total peptide-induced dye leakage. Similar traces were obtained at both lower and higher POPC vesicle concentrations (data not shown). These experiments showed that cyclotides are capable of altering membrane permeability, leading to loss of the internal vesicle contents to the external medium. Kalata B1 showed a similar concentration-dependent effect on POPC and POPG vesicles (Fig. 2C) and caused 100% leakage at peptide-to-lipid ratio of 2:1 for both model membranes. Fig. 3 shows the kalata B1-induced leakage of CF from vesicles of mixed lipid composition. POPC/POPE/SM/cholesterol (molar ratio, 2:2:3:1) was selected to represent mammalian cell membranes, such as human erythrocytes (29Yeaman M.R. Yount N.Y. Pharmacol. Rev. 2003; 55: 27-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (2333) Google Scholar), and was compared with a single lipid system composed of pure POPC or mixed lipid systems lacking either cholesterol or sphingomyelin. Compared with POPC alone (EC50 = 37.8 μm), kalata B1 showed a greater affinity for vesicles consisting of POPC/POPE/SM/cholesterol (EC50 = 2.1 μm). The concentration-response curves of two other vesicles lacking sphingomyelin (5.9 μm) or cholesterol (4.5 μm), showed kalata B1 had decreased affinity for these lipid compositions. A suite of 22 single point alanine mutants of kalata B1 was synthesized and examined in dye leakage experiments to determine the residues responsible for the lytic ability of the peptide. The mutants were tested at 50 μm and compared with wild-type kalata B1, which resulted in 100% leakage at this concentration. Fig. 4A shows the results of triplicate measurements for each of the alanine mutants. Substitution of any residue in loop 1 (see Fig. 1 for loop definitions) of kalata B1, by Ala, was observed to abolish the lytic ability of the peptide, as did mutation of Trp-23 or Val-25 in loop 5. The lack of activity of these mutants was not due to incorrect folding, because their αH shifts corresponded closely to those of the native peptide reported previously (18Simonsen S.M. Sando L. Rosengren K.J. Wang C.K. Colgrave M.L. Daly N.L. Craik D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 9805-9813Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar), consistent with them having the same global fold. The G12A mutation in loop 2, the N15A and T16A mutations in loop 3, and the P3A mutation in loop 6 resulted in significant (∼75%), but not complete, loss of activity. These results correlate well with trends in the hemolytic activity against human erythrocytes (18Simonsen S.M. Sando L. Rosengren K.J. Wang C.K. Colgrave M.L. Daly N.L. Craik D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 9805-9813Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar) of a series of alanine mutants of kalata B1, as shown in Fig. 4B. Fig. 4C shows a three-dimensional representation of the residues critical to the lytic ability of kalata B1 (Gly-6, Glu-7, Thr-8, Trp-23, and Val-25). Mutations that caused a significant decrease, i.e. 20–40% of the activity of wild-type kalata B1 (Gly-12, Asn-15, Thr-16, and Pro-3) or a slight decrease, i.e. reduced lytic activity to 40–60% (Val-10, Gly-11, Arg-28, Leu-2, and Val-4) are also depicted. Notably, residues responsible for lytic ability are localized on one surface of kalata B1. The reversibility of the interaction of kalata B1 with phospholipid membranes was investigated using a 50:50 mixture of dye-loaded and dye-free vesicles (34de los Rios V. Mancheño J.M. Lanio M.E. Oñaderra M. Gavilanes J.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 252: 284-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). We found that at 12.5 or 25 μm concentrations the percentage leakage for a 50:50 mixture of dye-loaded and dye-free vesicles was equivalent to 100% dye-loaded vesicles (data not shown). Therefore the peptide did not discriminate between the dye-loaded or dye-free vesicles, i.e. the membrane properties did not change in the presence or absence of the fluorescent dye. To explore the kinetics of association of kalata B1 with the phospholipid vesicles, the leakage of CF was monitored over 90 min (Fig. 5). The majority of lysis (80%) occurred over the first 2.5 min for the 50:50 mixture of dye-loaded and dye-free vesicles, with a calculated half-life of ∼0.5 min. This was also the case for the leakage of CF from solutions containing 100% dye-loaded vesicles. In a separate experiment, kalata B1 was preincubated with dye-free vesicles for 30 min, prior to the addition of dye-loaded vesicles. In this system, lysis occurred at a slower rate, with 80% of leakage occurring after 30 min, and reached a maximum of approximately half of the value obtained for the lysis from the mixed vesicles without a preincubation period. The calculated half-life for leakage from the dye-containing vesicles following the preincubation was >5 min (representing a 10-fold increase over the case with no preincubation). This trend took place at both concentrations of kalata B1 and indicates that slow exchange of peptide molecules between the vesicles occurs, with ∼25% of the peptide available to cause lysis of the dye-loaded vesicles following the preincubation. Patch clamp recording was developed to understand the electrophysiology of cellular membranes by measuring ion currents passing through the membranes of biological cells (35Neher E. Sakmann B.

The present ""case-control"" study takes a global approach to understanding the molecular basis of autism spectrum disorders based upon large-scale gene expression profiling. DNA microarray analyses were conducted on lymphoblastoid cell lines from over 20 sib pairs in which one sibling had a diagnosis of autism and the other was not affected in order to identify biochemical and signaling pathways which are differentially regulated in cells from autistic and nonautistic siblings. Bioinformatics and gene ontological analyses of the data implicate genes which are involved in nervous system development, inflammation, and cytoskeletal organization, in addition to genes which may be relevant to gastrointestinal or other physiological symptoms often associated with autism. Moreover, the data further suggests that these processes may be modulated by cholesterol/steroid metabolism, especially at the level of androgenic hormones. Elevation of male hormones, in turn, has been suggested as a possible factor influencing susceptibility to autism, which affects approximately 4 times as many males as females. Preliminary metabolic profiling of steroid hormones in lymphoblastoid cell lines from several pairs of siblings reveals higher levels of testosterone in the autistic sibling, which is consistent with the increased expression of two genes involved in the steroidogenesis pathway. Global gene expression profiling of cultured cells from ASD probands thus serves as a window to underlying metabolic and signaling deficits that may be relevant to the pathobiology of autism."
https://openalex.org/W2088983023,"In Alzheimer disease (AD) and frontotemporal dementia the microtubule-associated protein Tau becomes progressively hyperphosphorylated, eventually forming aggregates. However, how Tau dysfunction is associated with functional impairment is only partly understood, especially at early stages when Tau is mislocalized but has not yet formed aggregates. Impaired axonal transport has been proposed as a potential pathomechanism, based on cellular Tau models and Tau transgenic mice. We recently reported K369I mutant Tau transgenic K3 mice with axonal transport defects that suggested a cargo-selective impairment of kinesin-driven anterograde transport by Tau. Here, we show that kinesin motor complex formation is disturbed in the K3 mice. We show that under pathological conditions hyperphosphorylated Tau interacts with c-Jun N-terminal kinase- interacting protein 1 (JIP1), which is associated with the kinesin motor protein complex. As a result, transport of JIP1 into the axon is impaired, causing JIP1 to accumulate in the cell body. Because we found trapping of JIP1 and a pathological Tau/JIP1 interaction also in AD brain, this may have pathomechanistic implications in diseases with a Tau pathology. This is supported by JIP1 sequestration in the cell body of Tau-transfected primary neuronal cultures. The pathological Tau/JIP1 interaction requires phosphorylation of Tau, and Tau competes with the physiological binding of JIP1 to kinesin light chain. Because JIP1 is involved in regulating cargo binding to kinesin motors, our findings may, at least in part, explain how hyperphosphorylated Tau mediates impaired axonal transport in AD and frontotemporal dementia.

The microtubule-associated protein Tau is predominantly found in the axonal compartment of neurons, where it binds to microtubules (1Lee V.M. Goedert M. Trojanowski J.Q. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2001; 24: 1121-1159Crossref PubMed Scopus (2097) Google Scholar). In human brain, six isoforms of Tau are expressed, due to alternative splicing of exons 2, 3 and 10 (2Goedert M. Spillantini M.G. Jakes R. Rutherford D. Crowther R.A. Neuron. 1989; 3: 519-526Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1815) Google Scholar). Tau consists of an amino-terminal projection domain followed by 3 or 4 microtubule binding repeats (3R or 4R), due to splicing of exon 10, and a carboxyl-terminal tail region.

Hyperphosphorylation of Tau is thought to be an initiating step (4Alonso A.C. Grundke-Iqbal I. Iqbal K. Nat Med. 1996; 2: 783-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (681) Google Scholar), as it detaches Tau from microtubules and makes it prone to form aggregates (1Lee V.M. Goedert M. Trojanowski J.Q. Annu. Rev.

Whereas in AD no mutations have been identified in the MAPT gene encoding Tau, so far 42 intronic and exonic mutations have been found in familial forms of FTD (6Cruts M. Van Broeckhoven C.

Science. 2008; 319: 1086-1089Crossref PubMed Scopus (706) Google Scholar), and in cell culture overexpression of Tau was shown to lead to impaired transport of mitochondria and vesicles (14Mandelkow E.M.

Res. 2007; 85: 2620-2630Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar).To dissect Tau-mediated axonal transport defects at a molecular level, we used K3 mice that overexpress human Tau carrying the pathogenic FTD K369I mutation (17Ittner L.M. Fath T. Ke Y.D. Bi M. van Eersel J. Li K.M. Gunning P. Götz J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 15597-16002Crossref Scopus (179) Google Scholar). We observed a pronounced hyperphosphorylation of transgenic Tau in many brain areas. Clinically, the mice present with an early onset motor phenotype that is, at least in part, caused by impairment of axonal transport in neurons of the substantia nigra. Interestingly, only selected aspects of anterograde axonal transport were impaired, in particular those of kinesin-I motor complex-driven vesicles and mitochondria. Our data suggest a selective impairment of axonal transport rather than a generalized, non-selective blockage of microtubules that has been established in cell culture systems, which fail to phosphorylate Tau at the high levels that are found in vivo even under physiological conditions. More importantly, in AD and FTD Tau is even more phosphorylated, i.e. hyperphosphorylated at physiological sites and de novo at pathological sites, preventing it from binding to microtubules (1Lee V.M. Goedert M. Trojanowski J.Q. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2001; 24: 1121-1159Crossref PubMed Scopus (2097) Google Scholar).Based on our findings of an impaired kinesin-I-driven axonal transport in the K3 mice, we speculated that hyperphosphorylated Tau may impair anterograde transport by interfering directly with components of the kinesin-I motor complex rather than disrupting the binding of the kinesin heavy chain (see below) to microtubules. Axonal transport along microtubules is mediated by members of the kinesin superfamily (KIF) of motor proteins (21Hirokawa N. Takemura R. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2005; 6: 201-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (658) Google Scholar, 22Vale R.D. Reese T.S. Sheetz M.P. Cell. 1985; 42: 39-50Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1398) Google Scholar, 23Brady S.T. Nature. 1985; 317: 73-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar). The KIFs typically consist of an ATPase domain that interacts with microtubules and drives movement and a domain that links to cargos, either directly or indirectly, as in the case of KIF5, by assembling with the kinesin light chain (KLC) to form the kinesin-I (KIF5/KLC) motor complex (24Hirokawa N. Pfister K.K. Yorifuji H. Wagner M.C. Brady S.T. Bloom G.S. Cell. 1989; 56: 867-878Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). In addition, increasing evidence suggests that scaffolding proteins mediate and regulate the binding of cargos to KIFs (21Hirokawa N. Takemura R. Nat. Rev.

We found that the pathological interaction of hyperphosphorylated Tau and JIP1 competes with the physiological binding of JIP1 to KLC.DISCUSSIONIn the present study, which combines the analysis of transgenic brain, human brain samples, primary cultures, and in vitro experiments, we found that hyperphosphorylated Tau disrupts the functional binding of JIP1 to the kinesin-I motor complex. We found that Tau pathologically interacts with JIP1 both in our K3 mouse model and in AD brain, causing a re-localization of JIP1 from axons to cell bodies. When Tau was expressed in primary hippocampal neurons, this also resulted in a decreased axonal localization concomitant with an accumulation of JIP1 in cell bodies. Finally, we showed that the Tau/JIP1 interaction is phosphorylation-dependent and that this pathologic interaction competes with the binding of JIP1 to KLC.Regulation of axonal transport remains poorly understood, but it has been suggested recently that it may be regulated at the level of cargo binding to the motors (21Hirokawa N.

Of the proteins involved in cargo binding, JIP1 has been found to interact specifically with KLC (29Verhey K.J. Meyer D. Deehan R. Blenis J. Schnapp B.J. Rapoport T.A. Margolis B. J.

JIP is also a scaffolding protein for different components of the JNK signaling cascade, including JNK and its upstream kinases (46Whitmarsh A.J. Cavanagh J. Tournier C. Yasuda J. Davis R.J.

JNK activation has been shown to regulate the kinesin/cargo binding by mediating the release of cargos once they have reached their final destination in the distal axon (26Horiuchi D. Collins C.A.

Axonal transport defects in spinal and bulbar muscle atrophy have been suggested to result from increased JNK activity and subsequent phosphorylation of kinesin (27Morfini G. Pigino G. Szebenyi G. You Y. Pollema S. Brady S.T. Nat. Neurosci. 2006; 9: 907-916Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar).Impaired anterograde axonal transport has also been implicated in the pathogenesis of diseases such as AD (8Götz J. Ittner L.M. Kins S. J. Neurochem. 2006; 98: 993-1006Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Many of these disorders are associated with Tau pathology. Thus, the aberrant interaction we have identified for phosphorylated Tau and the scaffold protein JIP1, whether direct or indirect, may explain, at least in part, impaired axonal transport. Mechanistically, we propose that the Tau/JIP1 interaction competes with the physiological binding of JIP1 to KLC. Hence, JIP1 fails in scaffolding regulatory kinases to the kinesin-I motor complex in axons. As a consequence, anterograde axonal transport of cargos specifically transported by the kinesin-I complex is impaired, eventually disturbing normal neuronal function. This pathomechanism may explain the clinical symptoms of Tau transgenic mice (17Ittner L.M. Fath T. Ke Y.D. Bi M. van Eersel J. Li K.M. Gunning P. Götz J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 15597-16002Crossref Scopus (179) Google Scholar) and, possibly, neuronal dysfunction in AD and FTD.Our in vivo finding that JIP1 fails to interact with KLC and is instead bound by phosphorylated Tau and retained in the cell body is consistent with an increased JIP1 staining in the soma of neurons in both K3 mice and in AD (49Helbecque N. Abderrahamani A. Meylan L. Riederer B. Mooser V. Miklossy J. Delplanque J. Boutin P. Nicod P. Haefliger J.A. Cottel D. Amouyel P. Froguel P. Waeber G. Mol.

Because JIP1 is also a scaffolding protein for several kinases, many of which phosphorylate Tau, it cannot be excluded that JIP1 mislocalization may also promote hyperphosphorylation of Tau in the soma, establishing a vicious cycle.Although we cannot rule out that the Tau/JIP1 interaction may also have a physiological function in axonal transport, our data indicate that breaking up the aberrant Tau/JIP1 interaction may restore anterograde axonal transport and, hence, represent a novel approach in treating neurodegenerative diseases with Tau pathology. The microtubule-associated protein Tau is predominantly found in the axonal compartment of neurons, where it binds to microtubules (1Lee V.M. Goedert M. Trojanowski J.Q. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2001; 24: 1121-1159Crossref PubMed Scopus (2097) Google Scholar). In human brain, six isoforms of Tau are expressed, due to alternative splicing of exons 2, 3 and 10 (2Goedert M. Spillantini M.G. Jakes R. Rutherford D. Crowther R.A. Neuron. 1989; 3: 519-526Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1815) Google Scholar). Tau consists of an amino-terminal projection domain followed by 3 or 4 microtubule binding repeats (3R or 4R), due to splicing of exon 10, and a carboxyl-terminal tail region.

They are found in nerve cell bodies and apical dendrites as neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs), in distal dendrites as neuropil threads, and in the abnormal neurites that are associated with some amyloid plaques (neuritic plaques) (3Goedert M.

Hyperphosphorylation of Tau is thought to be an initiating step (4Alonso A.C. Grundke-Iqbal I. Iqbal K. Nat Med. 1996; 2: 783-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (681) Google Scholar), as it detaches Tau from microtubules and makes it prone to form aggregates (1Lee V.M. Goedert M. Trojanowski J.Q. Annu. Rev.

Whereas in AD no mutations have been identified in the MAPT gene encoding Tau, so far 42 intronic and exonic mutations have been found in familial forms of FTD (6Cruts M. Van Broeckhoven C.

Science. 2008; 319: 1086-1089Crossref PubMed Scopus (706) Google Scholar), and in cell culture overexpression of Tau was shown to lead to impaired transport of mitochondria and vesicles (14Mandelkow E.M.

Axonal transport defects have also been reproduced in wild-type Tau transgenic mice (16Ishihara T. Hong M. Zhang B. Nakagawa Y. Lee M.K. Trojanowski J.Q. Lee V.M. Neuron. 1999; 24: 751-762Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar) and in K369I mutant Tau K3 mice (17Ittner L.M. Fath T. Ke Y.D. Bi M. van Eersel J. Li K.M. Gunning P. Götz J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 15597-16002Crossref Scopus (179) Google Scholar), whereas Tau expression failed to inhibit axonal transport in other systems (18Morfini G. Pigino G.

Neurosci. 2008; 28: 1682-1687Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). This apparent discrepancy may depend on the type of cargos analyzed and, specifically, the experimental paradigm, e.g. using phosphorylated (16Ishihara T. Hong M. Zhang B. Nakagawa Y. Lee M.K.

Res. 2007; 85: 2620-2630Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). To dissect Tau-mediated axonal transport defects at a molecular level, we used K3 mice that overexpress human Tau carrying the pathogenic FTD K369I mutation (17Ittner L.M. Fath T. Ke Y.D. Bi M. van Eersel J. Li K.M. Gunning P. Götz J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 15597-16002Crossref Scopus (179) Google Scholar). We observed a pronounced hyperphosphorylation of transgenic Tau in many brain areas. Clinically, the mice present with an early onset motor phenotype that is, at least in part, caused by impairment of axonal transport in neurons of the substantia nigra. Interestingly, only selected aspects of anterograde axonal transport were impaired, in particular those of kinesin-I motor complex-driven vesicles and mitochondria. Our data suggest a selective impairment of axonal transport rather than a generalized, non-selective blockage of microtubules that has been established in cell culture systems, which fail to phosphorylate Tau at the high levels that are found in vivo even under physiological conditions. More importantly, in AD and FTD Tau is even more phosphorylated, i.e. hyperphosphorylated at physiological sites and de novo at pathological sites, preventing it from binding to microtubules (1Lee V.M. Goedert M. Trojanowski J.Q. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2001; 24: 1121-1159Crossref PubMed Scopus (2097) Google Scholar). Based on our findings of an impaired kinesin-I-driven axonal transport in the K3 mice, we speculated that hyperphosphorylated Tau may impair anterograde transport by interfering directly with components of the kinesin-I motor complex rather than disrupting the binding of the kinesin heavy chain (see below) to microtubules. Axonal transport along microtubules is mediated by members of the kinesin superfamily (KIF) of motor proteins (21Hirokawa N. Takemura R. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2005; 6: 201-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (658) Google Scholar, 22Vale R.D. Reese T.S. Sheetz M.P. Cell. 1985; 42: 39-50Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1398) Google Scholar, 23Brady S.T. Nature. 1985; 317: 73-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar). The KIFs typically consist of an ATPase domain that interacts with microtubules and drives movement and a domain that links to cargos, either directly or indirectly, as in the case of KIF5, by assembling with the kinesin light chain (KLC) to form the kinesin-I (KIF5/KLC) motor complex (24Hirokawa N. Pfister K.K. Yorifuji H. Wagner M.C. Brady S.T. Bloom G.S. Cell. 1989; 56: 867-878Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). In addition, increasing evidence suggests that scaffolding proteins mediate and regulate the binding of cargos to KIFs (21Hirokawa N. Takemura R. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2005; 6: 201-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (658) Google Scholar, 25Horiuchi D. Barkus R.V. Pilling A.D. Gassman A. Saxton W.M. Curr.

JNK activation has been shown to regulate the kinesin/cargo binding by mediating the release of cargos once they have reached their final destination in the distal axon (26Horiuchi D. Collins C.A. Bhat P. Barkus R.V. Diantonio A. Saxton W.M. Curr. Biol. 2007; 17: 1313-1317Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Axonal transport defects in spinal and bulbar muscle atrophy have been suggested to result from increased JNK activity and subsequent phosphorylation of kinesin (27Morfini G. Pigino G. Szebenyi G. You Y. Pollema S. Brady S.T. Nat. Neurosci. 2006; 9: 907-916Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Impaired anterograde axonal transport has also been implicated in the pathogenesis of diseases such as AD (8Götz J. Ittner L.M. Kins S. J. Neurochem. 2006; 98: 993-1006Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Many of these disorders are associated with Tau pathology. Thus, the aberrant interaction we have identified for phosphorylated Tau and the scaffold protein JIP1, whether direct or indirect, may explain, at least in part, impaired axonal transport. Mechanistically, we propose that the Tau/JIP1 interaction competes with the physiological binding of JIP1 to KLC. Hence, JIP1 fails in scaffolding regulatory kinases to the kinesin-I motor complex in axons. As a consequence, anterograde axonal transport of cargos specifically transported by the kinesin-I complex is impaired, eventually disturbing normal neuronal function. This pathomechanism may explain the clinical symptoms of Tau transgenic mice (17Ittner L.M. Fath T. Ke Y.D. Bi M. van Eersel J. Li K.M. Gunning P. Götz J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 15597-16002Crossref Scopus (179) Google Scholar) and, possibly, neuronal dysfunction in AD and FTD. Our in vivo finding that JIP1 fails to interact with KLC and is instead bound by phosphorylated Tau and retained in the cell body is consistent with an increased JIP1 staining in the soma of neurons in both K3 mice and in AD (49Helbecque N. Abderrahamani A. Meylan L. Riederer B. Mooser V. Miklossy J. Delplanque J. Boutin P. Nicod P. Haefliger J.A. Cottel D. Amouyel P. Froguel P. Waeber G. Mol. Psychiatry. 2003; 8 (363): 413-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Because JIP1 is also a scaffolding protein for several kinases, many of which phosphorylate Tau, it cannot be excluded that JIP1 mislocalization may also promote hyperphosphorylation of Tau in the soma, establishing a vicious cycle. Although we cannot rule out that the Tau/JIP1 interaction may also have a physiological function in axonal transport, our data indicate that breaking up the aberrant Tau/JIP1 interaction may restore anterograde axonal transport and, hence, represent a novel approach in treating neurodegenerative diseases with Tau pathology.

However, structural analyses to date have focused on how SF1A helicases achieve 3'-5' movement along nucleic acids. We present crystal structures of the complex between the SF1B helicase RecD2 from Deinococcus radiodurans and ssDNA in the presence and absence of an ATP analog. These snapshots of the reaction pathway reveal a nucleotide binding-induced conformational change of the two motor domains that is broadly reminiscent of changes observed in other SF1 and SF2 helicases. Together with biochemical data, the structures point to a step size for translocation of one base per ATP hydrolyzed. Moreover, the structures also reveal a mechanism for nucleic acid translocation in the 5'-3' direction by SF1B helicases that is surprisingly different from that of 3'-5' translocation by SF1A enzymes, and explains the molecular basis of directionality."
https://openalex.org/W2034175329,"Changes in expression levels of genes encoding for proteins that control metabolic pathways are essential to maintain nutrient and energy homeostasis in individual cells as well as in or ga nisms. An important regulated step in this process is accomplished through covalent chemical modifications of proteins that form complexes with the chromatin of gene promoters. The peroxisome proliferators γ co-activator 1 (PGC-1) family of transcriptional co-activators comprises important components of a number of these complexes and participates in a large array of glucose and lipid metabolic adaptations. Here, we show that PGC-1β is acetylated on at least 10 lysine residues distributed along the length of the protein by the acetyl transferase general control of amino-acid synthesis (GCN5) and that this acetylation reaction is reversed by the deacetylase sirtuin 1 (SIRT1). GCN5 strongly interacts with PGC-1β and represses its transcriptional activity associated with transcription factors such as ERRα, NRF-1, and HNF4α, however acetylation and transcriptional repression do not occur when a catalytically inactive GCN5 is co-expressed. Transcriptional repression coincides with PGC-1β redistribution to nuclear foci where it co-localizes with GCN5. Furthermore, knockdown of GCN5 ablates PGC-1β acetylation and increases transcriptional activity. In primary skeletal muscle cells, PGC-1β induction of endogenous target genes, including MCAD and GLUT4, is largely repressed by GCN5. Functionally, this translates to a blunted response to PGC-1β-induced insulin-mediated glucose transport. These results suggest that PGC-1β acetylation by GCN5 might be an important step in the control of glucose and lipid pathways and its dysregulation could contribute to metabolic diseases.

Transcriptional control of gene expression is a very dynamic and regulated process that involves assembly of protein complexes organized in space and time. Often this assembly is directed by covalent modification of transcriptional proteins dictating novel physical interactions, resulting in tightly controlled expression of genes. Among these modifications, protein acetylation at lysine residues has been implicated in control of gene expression (1Roth S.Y. Denu J.M. Allis C.D. Annu. Rev.

Cells, either individually or organized in tissues, respond to environmental cues through multiple adaptive responses to maintain homeostasis. An important part of this cellular response involves rapid changes in expression of genes encoding proteins that will functionally adapt the cell or organism to the new condition.

The PGC-1 family is composed of three members, PGC-1α, PGC-1β, and PRC, which play important metabolic roles in various tissues. These proteins contain a similar architecture with an activation domain at the N terminus, a middle region associated with repression, and a C terminus with two domains involved in RNA processing. A main mechanism of control of the PGC-1s is through regulation of their own gene expression. For example, PGC-1α is rapidly induced in response to low temperatures in brown adipose tissue, fasting in liver or exercise in skeletal muscle (3Scarpulla R.C. Biochim. Biophys.

An increase of cAMP levels is one of the main signals involved in this transcriptional response, which leads to activation of PGC-1α function (6Uldry M. Yang W. St-Pierre J. Lin J. Seale P.

In high glucose concentrations PGC-1α is largely acetylated on at least 13 lysine residues, which in turn are deacetylated by SIRT1 in response to low glucose. In addition, SIRT1 activators are sufficient to deacetylate and activate PGC-1α leading to increases in energy expenditure (23Baur J.A. Pearson K.J. Price N.L. Jamieson H.A. Lerin C. Kalra A.

Structurally, PGC-1β contains similar domains to PGC-1α along the protein, but with an extended middle region (30Lin J. Puigserver P. Donovan J. Tarr P. Spiegelman B.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 1645-1648Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar, 31Kressler D. Schreiber S.N. Knutti D. Kralli A. J. Biol.

Given the similarities between PGC-1α and PGC-1β and the regulatory role of PGC-1α acetylation, we investigated whether PGC-1β is acetylated by GCN5 and determined the functional consequences as it relates to gene expression and glucose transport. Here, we report that PGC-1β is a substrate for GCN5 and is acetylated on at least 10 lysine residues that are distributed along multiple domains of the protein. SIRT1 overexpression is sufficient to completely deacetylate PGC-1β. shRNA knockdown of GCN5 resulted in loss of basal acetylation and an induction of transcriptional activity. Moreover, wild-type GCN5 but not mutant, catalytically inactive GCN5 strongly repressed PGC-1β transcriptional activity. In primary skeletal muscle cells, GCN5 repressed expression of target genes involved in glucose and fatty acid utilization. Functionally, the effects of GCN5 on PGC-1β target gene expression correlated with a blockage of insulin-stimulated glucose uptake. These results indicate that acetylation of PGC-1β is sufficient to control its transcriptional co-activation activity and might have important consequences in metabolic diseases if dysregulated. pcDNA-PGC-1β construct was a gift from Bruce Spiegelman (Dana Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA). To generate GAL4-DBD and pAdTrack plasmids, PGC-1β was subcloned into the backbone of these plasmids. Constructs used in these studies for different transcription factors, wild-type and mutant GCN5, have already been described (19Rodgers J.T. Lerin C. Haas W. Gygi S.P. Spiegelman B.M. Puigserver P. Nature. 2005; 434: 113-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (2541) Google Scholar, 18Lerin C. Rodgers J.T. Kalume D.E. Kim S.H. Pandey A. Puigserver P.

HEK 293 cells were routinely cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal bovine serum. Primary skeletal muscle cells were isolated and cultured as previously described (32Sabourin L.A. Girgis-Gabardo A. Seale P. Asakura A. Rudnicki M.A. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 631-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). 80% confluent myoblasts were switched to the differentiation medium, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 5% horse serum. Myotubes were transduced with adenoviruses encoding for PGC-1β or GCN5 for a period of 48 h. Immunofluorescence experiments were performed 48 h after transfection with plasmids encoding for HA-PGC-1β and FLAG-GCN5. Immunofluorescence was performed using mouse anti-HA antibody to detect PGC-1β and rabbit anti-GCN5 antibody as previously described (18Lerin C. Rodgers J.T. Kalume D.E. Kim S.H. Pandey A. Puigserver P. Cell Metab. 2006; 3: 429-438Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). FLAG- or HA-tagged PGC-1β were expressed in HEK 293 cells via transfection using PolyFect (Qiagen) or in primary skeletal muscle cells by adenoviral infection. Whole cell extracts were used to immunoprecipitate PGC-1β or GCN5 with anti-FLAG M2 or HA antibody linked to agarose beads. After extensive washing, immunoprecipitates were separated by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted using the acetyllysine antibody (Cell Signaling) and the M2 FLAG antibody (Sigma) or HA (BabCO) to detect lysine acetylation and total protein levels, respectively. Mapping of acetylation on lysine residues of PGC-1β was performed by nanoscale microcapillary reverse phase liquid chromatography electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) (33Shevchenko A.

HEK 293 cells were infected with FLAG-HA-PGC-1β and FLAG-GCN5 and treated with 20 mm nicotinamide for a period of 12 h. Cells were harvested, and nuclear extracts were prepared as previously described (19Rodgers J.T. Lerin C. Haas W. Gygi S.P. Spiegelman B.M. Puigserver P. Nature. 2005; 434: 113-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (2541) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitation with anti-FLAG M2 antibodies linked to agarose was performed in 300 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100. After extensive washes, proteins were eluted with 0.5 mg/ml FLAG peptide, and proteins were precipitated with trichloroacetic acid. Protein from Coomassie-stained gel bands was in-gel reduced with dithiothreitol, and cysteine residues were derivatized with iodoacetamide. In-gel digestion of the protein was performed using either trypsin or chymotrypsin (33Shevchenko A. Wilm M. Vorm O. Mann M. Anal Chem. 1996; 68: 850-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (7784) Google Scholar), and the generated peptide mixtures were subjected to nanoscale microcapillary LC-MS/MS on a hybrid linear ion trap/FT-ICR mass spectrometer (LTQ FT, Thermo Electron) essentially as described previously (34Haas W. Faherty B.K. Gerber S.A. Elias J.E. Beausoleil S.A. Bakalarski C.E. Li X. Villén J. Gygi S.P. Mol.

Briefly, peptides were separated on a 125-μm inner diameter microcapillary C18 column, and MS and MS/MS data were collected in an automated fashion. A high mass accuracy and high mass resolution FT-ICR MS survey scan was followed by ten linear ion trap MS/MS experiments on the ten most abundant ions detected in the survey scan before a consecutive experimental cycle was initiated with another FT-survey scan. MS/MS data were automatically assigned by searching them against the PGC-1β sequence using the SEQUEST (35Eng J.K. McCormack A.L. Yates 3rd, J.R. J. Am. Soc. Mass Spectrom. 1994; 5: 976-989Crossref PubMed Scopus (5385) Google Scholar) algorithm and allowing lysine residues to be acetylated. The precursor ion mass tolerance in the data base search was set to ±2 Da, and no enzyme specificity constraints were used. Search results were filtered for peptide assignments with high mass accuracy (−7 to 3 ppm), and both termini were consistent with the specificity of the proteases used for the digest of the protein. Additionally, a ΔCn filter of 0.1 and XCorr filters of 1.5 for doubly, 2 for triply, and 3 for quadruply charged peptides were applied and MS/MS spectra of acetylated peptides were validated manually. HEK 293 cells were transfected using a ratio of DNA:PolyFect (Qiagen) 1:2. After transfection, cells were lysed and luciferase assays were performed. We normalized transfection efficiency using the Renilla system (Promega). mRNA expression levels were analyzed by quantitative real-time PCR. Total RNA was prepared from primary skeletal muscle cells via TRIzol extraction (Invitrogen). cDNA was generated by Superscript II enzyme (Invitrogen) and analyzed by quantitative reverse-transcriptase-mediated PCR using an iQ SYBR Green Supermix (Bio-Rad). All data were normalized to tubulin expression. The oligonucleotide primers can be provided upon request. Primary muscle myotubes were infected with adenoviruses encoding for green fluorescent protein, PGC-1β, and GCN5 and incubated with 5% horse serum for 48 h. Cells were then incubated with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 0.5%bovine serum albumin for 6 h and 100 nm insulin was added during the last 20 min. Glucose uptake was measured by incubating with [3H]2-deoxyglucose for 6 min and corrected by protein content. Based on our previous studies that PGC-1α is a substrate of the acetyl transferase GCN5 (18Lerin C. Rodgers J.T. Kalume D.E. Kim S.H. Pandey A. Puigserver P. Cell Metab. 2006; 3: 429-438Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar), we tested whether GCN5 might also interact with and acetylate PGC-1β. To this end, we infected primary skeletal myotubes with adenoviruses encoding for FLAG-GCN5 and HA-PGC-1β. Fig. 1A shows that immunoprecipitation of FLAG-GCN5 resulted in strong co-immunoprecipitation of HA-PGC-1β protein. Conversely, immunoprecipitated HA-PGC-1β was associated with FLAG-GCN5 suggesting physical interaction between both proteins (Fig. 1B). Similar to PGC-1α, ectopic expression of PGC-1β in cultured cells results in protein that is predominantly deacetylated, however, when co-expressed with GCN5, PGC-1β became strongly acetylated at lysine residues (Fig. 1C). In addition, two different types of experiments indicate that one of the PGC-1β deacetylases is the class III histone deacetylase sirtuin, SIRT1. First, PGC-1β acetylation is largely increased after treatment with nicotinamide (Fig. 1C) (a selective inhibitor of sirtuins). Second, expression of SIRT1 decreased GCN5-induced acetylation of PGC-1β (Fig. 1D). Taken together, these results indicate that PGC-1β is an acetylated protein and that its acetylation status is oppositely regulated by the enzymes GCN5 and SIRT1. To map the PGC-1β lysines acetylated by GCN5, we initiated a large scale purification of PGC-1β expressed in HEK 293 cells double infected with adenoviruses encoding for FLAG-HA-PGC-1β and FLAG-GCN5 and treated with nicotinamide. Immunoprecipitated PGC-1β was analyzed by tandem mass spectrometry. We identified 10 acetylated lysines with 87% coverage of the full-length PGC-1β protein (Fig. 2). Interestingly, only one lysine site at the C terminus of PGC-1α and PGC-1β seems to be conserved (PGC-1α K778 and PGC-1β K994), although most of the lysine acetylation sites are in regions of homology between both co-activators (supplemental Fig. S1). These results indicate that, similar to PGC-1α, PGC-1β is acetylated in multiple lysine residues that are distributed across the major domains of the protein. To determine the effects of GCN5 on PGC-1β transcriptional activity, we performed cell-based luciferase reporter assays using various transcription factors known to be co-activated by PGC-1β (30Lin J. Puigserver P. Donovan J. Tarr P. Spiegelman B.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 1645-1648Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar, 31Kressler D. Schreiber S.N. Knutti D. Kralli A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 13918-13925Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Fig. 3 shows that, as predicted, PGC-1β co-activated ERRα, NRF-1, as well as HNF4α transcription factors. Consistently, in all assays GCN5 potently repressed the ability of PGC-1β to activate these transcription factors. Similar repression effects were also observed in PGC-1β/ERRα-targeted promoters such as MCAD, an enzyme involved in mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation (Fig. 3). Together, these results indicate that GCN5 down-regulates the transcriptional activity of PGC-1β. To determine possible mechanisms by which GCN5 might control PGC-1β we performed cellular immunolocalization experiments. Expression of PGC-1β alone resulted in diffuse protein nuclear localization. However, co-expression of GCN5 resulted in re-localization of PGC-1β to nuclear foci also containing GCN5 protein (Fig. 4). These experiments suggest that localization of PGC-1β to nuclear foci by GCN5-mediated acetylation correlates with repression of its transcriptional activity. To further establish that PGC-1β transcriptional activity is altered by GCN5 mediated acetylation, a mutant GCN5 lacking acetyltransferase activity was tested in both cell-based acetylation and luciferase reporter assays. As shown previously with PGC-1α, overexpressed PGC-1β is not acetylated when co-expressed with inactive GCN5 (Fig. 5A). Furthermore, transcriptional co-activation of PGC-1β on GAL4-Errα was not significantly repressed by overexpressed catalytically inactive GCN5 mutant, unlike wild-type GCN5 (Fig. 5B). These data suggest that regulation of PGC-1β by GCN5 is due to increased lysine acetylation. Knockdown of endogenous GCN5 by shRNA was used to probe the acetylation status and associated transcriptional activity of PGC-1β. 293HEK cells were transfected with either a control or GCN5-targeted shRNA and treated with nicotinamide to inhibit endogenous SIRT1 deacetylase activity. Overexpression and immunoprecipitation of PGC-1β revealed a reduction in acetylation to an undetectable level by Western blot, suggesting that endogenous GCN5 is a major PGC-1β acetyltransferase (Fig. 6A). Indeed, knockdown of GCN5 also resulted in a small but reproducible increase in transcriptional co-activation of PGC-1β on Errα at the MCAD promoter, as determined by luciferase activity (Fig. 6B). Taken together with the acetylation status of PGC-1β, these results suggest that GCN5 may regulate PGC-1β transcriptional activity by altering the acetylation status of the protein. To further demonstrate the repressive effects of GCN5 on PGC-1β, endogenous expression of PGC-1β target genes were analyzed in primary skeletal muscle myotubes infected with adenoviruses encoding both proteins. PGC-1β expression alone was sufficient to induce mRNAs encoding for MCAD and GLUT4, two key enzymes involved in fatty acid and glucose utilization, respectively, ∼5-fold. Consistent with the effects on acetylation status and luciferase reporter assays, expression of GCN5 largely repressed the induction of these PGC-1β target genes (Fig. 7). Taken together, these results further suggest that GCN5 is a transcriptional repressor of PGC-1β. The fact that PGC-1β strongly increased expression of the insulin-sensitive glucose transporter GLUT4, led us to test whether the effects of gene expression translated into glucose uptake. We therefore analyzed insulin-mediated 2-deoxyglucose transport in primary skeletal myotubes. Interestingly, in this system expression of PGC-1β did not affect basal glucose uptake (data not shown). However, the transcriptional co-activator significantly increased the induction of glucose uptake in response to insulin (Fig. 8). Again, and consistent with our previous results in these studies, expression of GCN5 largely repressed the effects of PGC-1β on insulin-induced glucose uptake. These results indicate that the effects of this transcriptional co-activator on insulin-stimulated glucose transport are inhibited by expression of GCN5. Fluxes of nutrients through the different metabolic pathways are largely determined by activities of enzymes and transporters. Although acute control of these proteins is via modulation of the catalytic or transport activity (e.g. post-translational modification, allosteric regulation, or translocation), in most metabolic pathways regulation of genes encoding for enzymes and transporters directly impact the rates and dynamics at which these pathways function (36Owen O.E. Kalhan S.C. Hanson R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 30409-30412Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (758) Google Scholar, 37Lonard D.M. Lanz R.B. O'Malley B.W. Endocr. Rev. 2007; 28: 575-587Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). Transcriptional regulation in response to fluctuation of nutrients or hormones is accomplished by changes in activities of transcriptional complexes that are bound to the promoters of genes as well as by alteration of promoter occupancy. In this metabolic regulatory context, we have described that the transcriptional co-activator PGC-1β, similarly to PGC-1α, is regulated by lysine acetylation through the acetyl transferase GCN5. Acetylation of PGC-1β coincides with a modified spatial subnuclear localization and repression of its transcriptional co-activation activity, while knockdown of GCN5 induces transcriptional co-activation activity. Functionally, the ability of PGC-1β to increase insulin-mediated glucose transport in skeletal muscle cells is blunted by GCN5. PGC-1β-acetylated lysine residues are located in multiple domains suggesting that they might impact various binding partners and therefore activities of PGC-1β. For example, some of these lysines are close to the activation domain, whereas others are near nuclear localization signal sequences or in the proximity of the RNA processing motifs. Comparison of the identified acetylated lysines between PGC-1α and PGC-1β results in only one lysine at the C terminus that is conserved between both co-activators by BLAST analysis. However, most of the acetylated lysines are in regions of homology between PGC-1α and PGC-1β suggesting similar functions. It is possible that modification of specific lysines by acetylation could play specialized roles by defining interaction with particular sets of proteins. As a consequence, these interactions might lead to repression and translocation to nuclear foci. Moreover, binding affinities with specific transcription factors or other nuclear proteins that interact with different domains in PGC-1α or PGC-1β might change depending on the acetylation status. The specific function of these acetylation sites individually or in combination is currently under investigation. Another intriguing aspect of our studies is the fact that GCN5 acetylates histone 3 at lysine 9, which coincides with activation of gene expression (38Imoberdorf R.M. Topalidou I. Strubin M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 26: 1610-1616Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). However, in our experiments GCN5 blocks induction of PGC-1β target genes. It is conceivable that GCN5 might initially acetylate histone H3 to promote gene expression, but then act in a negative feedback loop to acetylate and down-regulate PGC-1β transcriptional activity. In fact, similar molecular mechanisms have been proposed for nuclear hormone receptor co-activator ACTR (39Chen H. Lin R.J. Schiltz R.L. Chakravarti D. Nash A. Nagy L. Privalsky M.L. Nakatani Y. Evans R.M. Cell. 1997; 90: 569-580Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1254) Google Scholar). It is also possible be that other histone acetyltransferases such as CREB-binding protein or p300 play a role in acetylation of histones in PGC-1β target genes, similar to PGC-1α targets (40Puigserver P. Adelmant G. Wu Z. Fan M. Xu J. O'Malley B. Spiegelman B.M. Science. 1999; 286: 1368-1371Crossref PubMed Scopus (493) Google Scholar). Although we cannot completely rule out this possibility, initial chromatin immunoprecipitation studies expressing PGC-1β or co-expressing PGC-1β and GCN5 results in little change of histone H3 acetylation status at the MCAD promoter (data not shown), suggesting that acetylation of histone H3 plays little if any role in driving transcription in response to PGC-1β overexpression. In these studies we have uncovered a new PGC-1β function associated with insulin-induced glucose uptake in skeletal muscle. The PGC-1β KO and hypomorphic allele transgenic mice present several metabolic abnormalities that include deficient adaptive thermogenesis, hepatic steatosis, and liver insulin resistance and impaired response to bacterial infection (26Lelliott C.J.

Conversely, transgenic PGC-1β are resistant to obesity in response to high fat diet and display increased insulin sensitivity associated with an increase in oxidative metabolism (42Arany Z.

In this context, we provide evidence in primary skeletal muscle cells that PGC-1β is sufficient to increase the response to insulin-mediated glucose transport and this correlates with increases in GLUT4 mRNA. Importantly, these effects were suppressed by GCN5. It is not clear how GCN5 might be modulated in skeletal muscle in response to insulin and in what metabolic context PGC-1β facilitates insulin action, at least in relation to glucose transport. In this regard, one of the acetylated PGC-1β lysine residues, Lys-202, precedes the A203P polymorphism that correlates with enhanced insulin-stimulated glucose metabolism in humans (44Ling C. Wegner L. Andersen G. Almgren P. Hansen T. Pedersen O. Groop L. Vaag A. Poulsen P. Diabetologia. 2007; 50: 1615-1620Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). It would be interesting to determine whether this amino acid substitution to proline can affect the Lys-202 acetylation and whether it might interfere with glucose transport. In summary, the studies presented here illustrate that PGC-1β acetylation, regulated by the enzymatic activities of GCN5 and SIRT1, controls expression of metabolic genes involved in fatty acid oxidation and glucose transport. The fact that small molecules can regulate the catalytic activity of these two enzymes suggests that PGC-1β acetylation might be targeted in metabolic diseases to modulate its transcriptional activity.

The TSG-6-mediated formation of the HC·HA complex has been demonstrated to play a crucial role in female fertility in mice.

However, it is not clear whether HA in AM forms HC·HA complex, and if so whether such an HC·HA complex exerts any of the above therapeutic actions. To address these questions, we extracted AM with buffers of increasing salt concentration. Because HMW HA was found to form the HC·HA complex and was mainly extractable by isotonic solutions, we further purified it from the isotonic AM extract and reconstituted it in vitro from three defined components, i.e. HMW HA, serum IαI, and recombinant TSG-6. Our results showed that the HC·HA complex is an active component in AM responsible for the suppression of TGF-β1 promoter activity, linkable to the scarring process noted before by AM (46Tseng S.C.

The antibody against human IαI and the secondary antibodies conjugated with the peroxidase were from DAKO (Carpinteria, CA). The recombinant human TSG-6 protein (TSG-6Q) was expressed in Drosophila S2 cells and purified to homogeneity as described previously (53Nentwich H.A. Mustafa Z. Rugg M.S. Marsden B.D. Cordell M.R.

Other antibodies to TSG-6 were from R&D Systems (mAb 2104) and Santa Cruz Biotechnology (sc-30140) (Santa Cruz, CA), respectively. Western LightingTM Chemiluminesence Reagent was from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Luciferase assay reagents including the cell lysis buffer was from Promega (Madison, WI). Cell Proliferation Kit (MTT) was from Roche Applied Science. BioPulverizer was from Biospec Products, Inc. (Bartlesville, OK). The ultracentrifuge (LM8 model, SW41 rotor) was from Beckman Coulter, Inc. (Fullerton, CA). Cryopreserved human AM, obtained from Bio-tissue, Inc. (Miami, FL), was sliced into small pieces, frozen in liquid nitrogen, and ground to fine powder by a BioPulverizer. The powder was mixed with Buffer A (100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 150 mm NaCl, 4 mm EDTA, 1% (v/v) Triton X-100) at 1:1 (g/ml) at 4 °C for 1 h. The mixture was centrifuged at 48,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C and the supernatant (Extract A) stored at −80 °C. The pellet was then washed three times with Buffer A before being extracted with Buffer B (100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 1 m NaCl, 4 mm EDTA, 1% (v/v) Triton X-100) at 4 °C for 1 h. After the centrifugation, the supernatant (Extract B) was stored. The remaining pellet was washed with Buffer B before adding Buffer C (100 mm sodium acetate, pH 5.8, 4 m guanidine hydrochloride, 4 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100) at 4 °C for 24 h. Again after the centrifugation, the supernatant (Extract C) was stored. Buffers A–C were supplemented with the following protease and phosphatase inhibitors: protease inhibitor mixture (1:100 dilution according to manufacturer's suggestion), 0.5 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, 50 mm sodium fluoride, and 0.2 mm sodium vanadate. Protein concentrations in AM extracts were determined by the BCA Protein Assay Kit, whereas HA concentrations by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay-based HA Quantitative Test Kit. The whole procedure for preparation of human AM extracts was carried out aseptically for subsequent cell culture-based experiments as recently reported (51He H. Li W. Chen S.Y. Zhang S. Chen Y.T. Hayashida Y. Zhu Y.T. Tseng S.C. Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2008; 49: 4468-4475Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Most of preparation steps were the same as described above with the following modifications. The AM powder was mixed with the cold PBS buffer without protease and phosphatase inhibitors at 1:1 (g/ml). The mixture was centrifuged at 48,000 × g at 4 °C for 30 min. The supernatant was designated as Extract PBS. According to a reported method (36Yingsung W. Zhuo L. Morgelin M. Yoneda M. Kida D. Watanabe H. Ishiguro N. Iwata H. Kimata K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 32710-32718Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar), Extract PBS (prepared in PBS) was dissolved in a CsCl, 4 m guanidine HCl mixture at the initial density of 1.35 g/ml, and centrifuged at 125,000 × g for 48 h at 15 °C. A total of 15 fractions (0.8 ml/fraction) were collected from the top to the bottom of each tube. Besides the density, the concentration of proteins and HA in each fraction were measured by the BCA Protein Assay and HA Quantitative Test Kit, respectively. Fractions 8–15, which contain HA but no detectable proteins, were pooled, adjusted with CsCl, 4 m guanidine HCl at the initial density of 1.40 g/ml, centrifuged, and fractionated in the same manner as described above. Fractions 3–15, which contained HA but no detectable proteins, were pooled and dialyzed against distilled water to remove CsCl and guanidine HCl. The dialysate was mixed with 3 volumes of 95% (v/v) ethanol containing 1.3% (w/v) potassium acetate at 0 °C for 1 h. After centrifugation at 15,000 × g, the pellet was washed with 70% (v/v) ethanol and centrifuged again. The pellet was briefly dried by air, stored at −80 °C, and designated as the nHC·HA complex. HABP was covalently cross-linked to Covalink-NH 96-well plates using a reported method (54Frost G.I. Stern R. Anal. Biochem. 1997; 251: 263-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). In brief, Covalink-NH plates were sterilized in 70% alcohol for 2 h and dried before being added with 50 μl of 0.184 mg/ml Sulfo-NHS in distilled water containing 0.04 mg/ml HABP per 96-well plate. The cross-linking was performed by adding 1 μl of 0.123 mg/ml 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbidodiimide in distilled water per well. The plate was incubated overnight at 4 °C or for 2 h at 25 °C before the coupling solution was removed, and washed 3 times with PBS containing 2 m NaCl and 50 mm MgSO4 followed by 3 washes with PBS. The HABP covalently cross-linked to the Covalink-NH 96-well plate was then incubated for 24 h at 25 °C with 50 μl of 1.5 to 200 μg/ml HMW HA (Healon) in PBS containing 5 mm MgCl2 with or without 40 μg/ml human IαI and/or 6 μg/ml recombinant human TSG-6Q (e.g. to form rcHC·HA complex (24Rugg M.S. Willis A.C. Mukhopadhyay D. Hascall V.C. Fries E. Fülöp C. Milner C.M. Day A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 25674-25686Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar)); the unbound component was removed by washing with PBS 4 times. Bound HA was released by incubation in 100 mm sodium acetate, pH 5.8, 4 m guanidine hydrochloride, 4 mm EDTA for 15 min, and quantitated using the HA Quantitative Test Kit after dialysis into distilled water. It was then subjected to HAase digestion or NaOH (see below) treatment before Western blotting. For biochemical characterization, AM extracts denoted as A, B, and C (with an equal volume) were dialyzed against the buffer D (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride) at 4 °C for 6 h. After dialysis, the volume of each extract was measured and adjusted to the same volume with buffer D. Extracts A, B, C, PBS (e.g. 100 μl), and HMW HA (Sigma) were digested with 20 units/ml HAase in the reaction buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1% (v/v) Triton X-100, 0.1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin, with protease and phosphatase inhibitors) for 2 h at 37 °C. The enzymatic digestion was stopped by adding 2× Laemmli sample buffer (62.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 25% glycerol, 2% (w/v) SDS, 0.01% (w/v) bromphenol blue, 710 mm β-mercaptoethanol) to the reaction mixture (1:1). For HA size analysis, Extracts A, B, and C were treated with 0.2 n NaOH for 4 h at 25 °C to completely remove ester bonds between HA and proteins (36Yingsung W. Zhuo L. Morgelin M. Yoneda M. Kida D. Watanabe H. Ishiguro N. Iwata H. Kimata K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 32710-32718Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). For optimizing NaOH treatment, i.e. to determine the association between HA and proteins, a series of NaOH concentrations (0–0.2 n) were used to treat Extract A for 1 h at 25 °C (18Zhao M. Yoneda M. Ohashi Y. Kurono S. Iwata H. Ohnuki Y. Kimata K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26657-26663Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). For the cell-based assay, HMW HA (Healon®) and Extract PBS were digested with 20 units/ml HAase in PBS, pH 7.5, for 1 h at 37 °C. For heat treatment, HMW HA (Healon) and Extract PBS were incubated into a water bath at 95 °C for 10 min followed by cooling on ice. HA sizes in AM extracts were analyzed by an agarose gel electrophoresis according to a published method (55Lee H.G. Cowman M.K. Anal. Biochem. 1994; 219: 278-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). Briefly, Extracts A, B, and C with or without treatment by HAase or NaOH were separated on 0.5% (w/v) agarose gels followed by staining with 0.005% (w/v) Stains-all dye in 50% (v/v) ethanol. The gels were stained overnight at 25 °C with light protection and HA visualized as bluish bands after de-staining in water and exposure to the room light for 6 h. The HA sizes were estimated by comparing to the Select-HA HiLadder and HMW HA (Healon). Samples were electrophoresed on 4–15% (w/v) gradient acrylamide ready gels under denaturing and reducing conditions. Proteins were transferred to the nitrocellulose membrane. The membrane was then blocked with 5% (w/v) fat-free milk in TBST (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.05% (v/v) Tween 20) followed by sequential incubation with specific primary antibodies against IαI, TSG-6, and their respective secondary antibodies. Immunoreactive proteins were detected with Western LightingTM Chemiluminesence Reagent. The plasmid containing the TGF-β1 promoter-luciferase reporter gene was kindly provided by Dr. Seong-Jin Kim (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD) and the TGF-β1 promoter-luciferase reporter gene was inserted at KpnI and HindIII sites of pGL3-basic as previously reported (56Kawakita T.

Expression of the TGF-β1 gene was measured by a promoter assay in human corneal fibroblasts cultured to 80% confluence (∼1.0 × 106 cells/10-cm dish) in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum as previously reported (48Kawakita T.

In short, after cells were washed twice with the medium, adeno-TGF-β1 promoter-luciferase (multiplicity of infection = 37.5) and adeno-CMV-β-galactosidase (multiplicity of infection = 30) were added to cells and incubated at 37 °C for 4 h. Cells were then trypsinized for 5 min and collected by centrifuged at 1500 × g (∼600 × g) for 5 min. Cells were re-suspended in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum and cell viability was measured by trypan blue stain. For experiments to determine the effect of Extract PBS, human corneal fibroblasts were seeded at 3 × 104/per well in a 24-well plastic plate before adding 1–125 μg/ml HMW HA (Healon), 0.04–125 μg of protein/ml Extract PBS or PBS (both HA and Extract PBS were dissolved in PBS).

Remarkably, the Hsf-controlled stress response system is conserved throughout the eukaryotic kingdom. Hsfs are maintained in an inactive state under normal growth conditions controlled by interaction with molecular chaperones, but they are rapidly activated under stress conditions (1Morimoto R.I.

Similar to other transcriptional activators, Hsfs have a modular structure (4von Koskull-Döring P. Scharf K.D. Nover L.

The C-terminal domains of Hsfs are more divergent, and many of them include localization signals for nuclear import (NLS) (20Lyck R. Harmening U. Höhfeld I. Scharf K.D. Nover L. Planta. 1997; 202: 117-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) and export (NES) (21Heerklotz D. Döring P. Bonzelius F. Winkelhaus S. Nover L. Mol. Cell.

Plant J. 2004; 39: 98-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). In yeast, Drosophila and nematodes Hsfs are encoded by unique genes, whereas multiple Hsfs exist in vertebrates. Hsf1, one of 3–4 Hsfs identified in vertebrates has been shown to function as ubiquitous regulator of the stress response, while the other members are assumed to have tissue- or development-specific functions (6Morimoto R.I. Genes Dev. 2008; 22: 1427-1438Crossref PubMed Scopus (695) Google Scholar, 19Pirkkala L. Nykänen P. Sistonen L. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 1118-1131Crossref PubMed Scopus (825) Google Scholar). In contrast to all other organisms investigated so far, plants possess an extraordinarily complex Hsf family both in terms of total number of representatives (usually more than 20) as well as of their structural and functional diversification. Three classes of plant Hsfs (classes A, B, and C) are defined by peculiarities of their HR-A/B regions (9Nover L. Bharti K. Döring P. Mishra S.K. Ganguli A. Scharf K.D. Cell Stress Chaperones. 2001; 6: 177-189Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Evidently, the Hsf mixture changes in a tissue-specific manner and in response to stress treatments (see reviews in Refs. 3Baniwal S.K. Bharti K. Chan K.Y. Fauth M. Ganguli A. Kotak S. Mishra S.K. Nover L. Port M. Scharf K.D. Tripp J. Weber C. Zielinski D. von Koskull-Döring P. J. Biosci. 2004; 29: 471-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar, 4von Koskull-Döring P. Scharf K.D. Nover L.

Remarkably, despite many similarities, our current knowledge indicates plant-specific variations of the Hsf network. (i) In tomato, HsfA1 functions as master regulator of the hs response (25Mishra S.K. Tripp J. Winkelhaus S. Tschiersch B. Theres K. Nover L. Scharf K.D. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 1555-1567Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar), whereas in Arabidopsis such a master regulator function could not be identified so far. Even the simultaneous knock-down of two HsfA1 isogenes (Hsfs A1a and A1b) had no marked effect on the hs response, and only a subset of hs genes was affected (26Lohmann C. Eggers-Schumacher G. Wunderlich M. Schöffl F. Mol. Genet. Genomics. 2004; 271: 11-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). (ii) In contrast to the situation in Arabidopsis, tomato HsfA1 operates upstream of hs-induced expression of chaperones and HsfA2. Hence, HsfA2 accumulates during repeated cycles of heat stress and recovery and becomes the dominant Hsf in thermotolerant cells. Its activity is further controlled by a network of proteins involving HsfA1 and chaperones of the sHsp family influencing its solubility, intracellular localization, and activator function (21Heerklotz D. Döring P. Bonzelius F. Winkelhaus S. Nover L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 1759-1768Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 27Scharf K.D. Heider H. Höhfeld I. Lyck R. Schmidt E. Nover L. Mol.

Plant Physiol. 2004; 135: 1457-1470Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Arabidopsis HsfA2 is also hs-inducible and highly expressed after heat stress treatment, but it is different in its physicochemical properties when compared with tomato HsfA2. The analysis of HsfA2 overexpression and knock-out plants of Arabidopsis indicate that HsfA2 functions as enhancer of hs gene expression with specific activity on a subset of Hsf-dependent genes (29Nishizawa A. Yabuta Y. Yoshida E. Maruta T. Yoshimura K. Shigeoka S. Plant J. 2006; 48: 535-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar, 30Schramm F. Ganguli A. Kiehlmann E. Englich G.

Plant Physiol. 2007; 143: 251-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar). Plant Hsfs interact with each other physically and/or functionally with the result of mutual enhancement or repression of their activities (21Heerklotz D. Döring P. Bonzelius F. Winkelhaus S. Nover L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 1759-1768Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 27Scharf K.D. Heider H. Höhfeld I. Lyck R. Schmidt E. Nover L. Mol. Cell.

Chem. 2007; 282: 3605-3613Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Although only a few examples of Hsf cooperation have been investigated in greater detail, remarkable differences in the underlying molecular mechanisms are apparent. The coactivator function of tomato HsfB1 depends on a histone-like motif in its C-terminal domain required for recruitment of the histone acetyltransferase-like protein HAC1, a plant ortholog of the p300/CBP (CREB-binding protein) family. Formation of ternary complexes of HsfA1, HsfB1, and HAC1 with enhanced DNA binding activities does not require physical interaction between the two Hsfs (32Bharti K. von Koskull-Döring P. Bharti S. Kumar P. Tintschl-Körbitzer A. Treuter E. Nover L. Plant Cell. 2004; 16: 1521-1535Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). In contrast, cooperation between class A Hsfs depends on their oligomerization domains and the formation of hetero-oligomeric complexes. However, despite a similar basic structure of the HR-A/B regions (Fig. 1), interactions between class A Hsfs are highly selective. The interaction of HsfA1 and HsfA2 leads to nuclear retention of HsfA2 and formation of superactivator complexes with enhanced transcriptional activities (21Heerklotz D. Döring P. Bonzelius F. Winkelhaus S. Nover L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 1759-1768Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 27Scharf K.D. Heider H. Höhfeld I. Lyck R. Schmidt E. Nover L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2240-2251Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the opposite functional consequence was observed for the HsfA4b/HsfA5 pair. By binding to HsfA4b, HsfA5 impairs DNA binding and consequently the activator function of Hsf4b (33Baniwal S.K. Chan K.Y. Scharf K.D. Nover L. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 3605-3613Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Here we challenge the current model of hetero-oligomerization dependence of the synergistic action of tomato HsfA1 and HsfA2. We demonstrate that multimeric complexes can be formed in the absence of DNA and that transcriptional activity strongly depends on hetero-complex formation. Besides nuclear retention of HsfA2, the combination of specific functional properties of both Hsfs in A1/A2 hetero-complexes is essential for the superactivator function. Standard protocols were used for cloning and nucleic acid analysis (Refs. 34Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology.

Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2001Google Scholar and supplemental Table S1). PCR fragments for subcloning were generated using the High Fidelity PCR Enzyme Mix (Fermentas, St. Leon-Rot, Germany). Protein extraction, SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE), and protein blotting analysis were performed as described (25Mishra S.K. Tripp J. Winkelhaus S. Tschiersch B. Theres K. Nover L.

Plant Physiol. 2004; 135: 1457-1470Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The loading of equal amounts of total protein extracts corresponding to 20,000 protoplasts and the efficiency of protein transfer were controlled by staining of the protein blots with Ponceau before performing consecutive cycles of immunodetection to monitor the protein levels of transiently expressed Hsfs and endogenous Hsp17-CI on the same blot. The generation and use of specific antisera against individual tomato (Lycopersicon pervianum) Hsfs (HsfA1, A2, A3) and Hsp17-CI were described before (20Lyck R. Harmening U. Höhfeld I. Scharf K.D. Nover L. Planta. 1997; 202: 117-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 28Port M. Tripp J. Zielinski D. Weber C. Heerklotz D. Winkelhaus S. Bublak D. Scharf K.D.

Plant J. 2000; 22: 355-365Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Primary antibodies for immunodetection of HA-tagged proteins were obtained from Hiss Diagnostics (Freiburg, Germany). Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich. For transient gene expression studies, tobacco (Nicotiana plumbaginifolia) leaf mesophyll protoplasts were used. Polyethylene glycol-mediated co-transformation of reporter and Hsf expression plasmids was carried out as described previously (22Treuter E. Nover L. Ohme K. Scharf K.D. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1993; 240: 113-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 27Scharf K.D. Heider H. Höhfeld I. Lyck R. Schmidt E. Nover L. Mol. Cell.

Gen. Genet. 1993; 240: 113-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Plasmid constructs for Hsf expression in plant cells are based on the pRT series of vectors (38Töpfer R. Schell J. Steinbiss H.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 8725Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Constructs for Hsfs A1, A2, A3, and A4b were described before (20Lyck R. Harmening U. Höhfeld I. Scharf K.D. Nover L. Planta. 1997; 202: 117-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 33Baniwal S.K. Chan K.Y. Scharf K.D. Nover L. J. Biol.

Plant J. 2000; 22: 355-365Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Further deletions or modifications were done on the basis of these parental expression vectors. Primer sequences (supplemental Table S1) and mutant constructs are given (supplemental Table S2). For subcellular localization studies, GFP-HsfA2 fusion constructs were generated by subcloning of corresponding PCR fragments into p35dS::GFP (39Reichel C. Mathur J. Eckes P. Langenkemper K. Koncz C. Schell J. Reiss B. Maas C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1996; 93: 5888-5893Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar) and analyzed by fluorescence microscopy in protoplasts according to procedures described before (21Heerklotz D. Döring P. Bonzelius F. Winkelhaus S. Nover L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 1759-1768Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 33Baniwal S.K. Chan K.Y. Scharf K.D. Nover L. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 3605-3613Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). For microscopic analysis, a Zeiss Axiophot microscope (Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany) combined with a Color View F12 System (Olympus, Hamburg, Germany) was used. Captured images were resized and combined using Photoshop 5.5 Software (Adobe Systems, La Jolla, CA). The promoter-GUS activity was determined as described (20Lyck R. Harmening U. Höhfeld I. Scharf K.D. Nover L. Planta. 1997; 202: 117-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). The synergism was calculated by Equation 1,(GUSHsfAX+HsfAY-GUSendog)(GUSHsfAX-GUSendog)+(GUSHsfAY-GUSendog)(Eq. 1) where GUSHsfAX+HsfAY is the activity determined for the combination of the indicated Hsfs or Hsf mutant forms, GUSHsfAX and GUSHsfAY are the activities of the individual Hsfs themselves, and GUSendog corresponds to the endogenous Hsf activity on the GUS reporter in protoplasts after mock transformation with the empty pRT vector. For data presentation in Fig. 5B, the additional stimulation (AS) of GUS activity by the combination of two transcription factors above additive activities proportional to the combination of wt HsfA1 and HsfA2 was calculated by Equation 2.AS[%WT]=(GUSHsfAX+HsfAY-GUSHsfAX-GUSHsfAY+GUSendog)(GUSHsfA1+HsfA2-GUSHsfA1-GUSHsfA2+GUSendog)×100(Eq. 2) GUSHsfA1+HsfA2 is the activity determined for the combination of wild type HsfA1 and HsfA2, while GUSHsfA1 and GUSHsfA2 are the activities of the individual wild type Hsfs, respectively. Protein extracts from 4 samples each of 1 × 105 protoplasts transformed with 5 μg of indicated Hsf expression plasmids were prepared in 100 μl of NEB500 lysis buffer containing 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 500 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm NaF, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 0.2% (w/v) Nonidet P-40, and 10% (w/v) glycerol and Complete protease inhibitor mixture tablets (Roche Applied Science). 5 μl were taken as input control; the residual extract was supplemented with NEB0 (i.e. NEB500 without NaCl) to a total volume of 400 μl. HsfA2 antiserum was coupled to NHS-activated Sepharose beads (GE Healthcare, Freiburg, Germany) according to the manufacturer's protocol and added as 1:10 slurry to the sample (40 μl). After incubation at 4 °C for 1 h with gentle agitation, beads were pelleted and washed three times with 500 μl of 10 mm Tris buffer (pH 8.0) supplied with 140 mm NaCl and 500 mm LiCl and once with 10 mm Tris buffer (pH 8.0) containing 140 mm NaCl. Bound proteins were eluted with 30 μl of 2× SDS sample buffer. Samples of 10 μl were separated by SDS-PAGE and processed for immunoblotting. Protein extracts in NEB500 corresponding to ∼500,000 protoplasts were separated by SEC on Superdex 200 HR30/10 filtration column (GE-Healthcare) at 4 °C by eluting with 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 500 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.2% (w/v) Nonidet P-40, and 1 mg ml−1 pefabloc at a flow rate of 0.4 ml min−1. Fractions of 0.8 ml were collected, precipitated with acetone, and redissolved in SDS sample buffer for immunoblot analyses. As molecular size standards, thyroglobulin (669 kDa), ferritin (440 kDa), catalase (232 kDa), lactate dehydrogenase (140 kDa), and bovine serum albumin (67 kDa) were used. Cross-linking reactions were performed with protein extracts in NEB500 buffer corresponding to 1 × 105 protoplasts by incubation in the presence of 2 mm glutaraldehyde at room temperature. The reaction was stopped after 10 min by the addition of 200 mm glycine and precipitation with acetone. After washing the precipitate with acetone and ethanol, proteins were dissolved in SDS sample buffer, separated on linear 4–12% SDS-PAGE gradient gels, and processed for immunoblotting of Hsf cross-linking products. To investigate the specificity of interactions of tomato class A Hsfs, we performed transient reporter assays using an Hsf-dependent hsp17-promoter::GUS reporter construct in tobacco mesophyll protoplasts (22Treuter E. Nover L. Ohme K. Scharf K.D. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1993; 240: 113-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). GUS activity was measured upon coexpression of different combinations of HsfA1, HsfA2, HsfA3, and HsfA4b (Fig. 1). First we examined the influence of increasing amounts of expression constructs in combinations of HsfA1 and HsfA2 by titration of either HsfA1 expression against a constant amount of HsfA2 or vice versa. An increasing stimulation of GUS activity was observed for all combinations of HsfA1 and HsfA2 (Fig. 2A, diamonds), which was ∼2.5–3.5-fold higher than expected for additive effects as determined from the individual activities (Fig. 2A, circles). Evidently, the interaction of HsfA1 and HsfA2 is synergistic with maximal activities at a stoichiometry close to 1:1 (HsfA1/HsfA2) (see also supplemental Fig. S1). In contrast to the HsfA1/HsfA2 combination, neither HsfA1 (Fig. 2B) nor HsfA2 (Fig. 2C) showed comparable effects with HsfA3 or HsfA4b. Based on these results, we conclude that HsfA1 and HsfA2 form a pair of specifically interacting Hsfs, which collaborate synergistically as a type of superactivator of hs gene expression. Hsfs have a modular structure with distinct domains performing specific functions such as DNA binding (DBD) and oligomerization (OD). The C-terminal activator domain (CTAD) contains motifs required for nuclear import and export and transcriptional activation (Fig. 1). To characterize their roles in synergistic gene activation, we constructed HsfA1 and HsfA2 mutants defective either in DNA binding, oligomerization, or activator functions (Fig. 3A). The DNA binding mutants of HsfA1 and HsfA2 were generated by replacing an invariant and functionally essential arginine residue in the DNA recognition helices (40Damberger F.F. Pelton J.G. Liu C. Cho H. Harrison C.J. Nelson H.C. Wemmer D.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 254: 704-719Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). The oligomerization mutants bear a deletion of the entire OD, and the transcriptional activation mutants are characterized by replacements of aromatic and hydrophobic amino acid residues in the C-terminal activator motifs (AHA motifs, Ref. 37Döring P. Treuter E. Kistner C. Lyck R. Chen A. Nover L. Plant Cell. 2000; 12: 265-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). In reporter assays, all HsfA1 and HsfA2 mutants showed strongly reduced activities, i.e. usually <15% of their wild type forms (supplemental Fig. S2). Next, the influence of these mutations on the synergistic activation in the presence of the corresponding partner Hsf was analyzed. In addition to the plasmid-borne GUS reporter, we used the activation of the endogenous chromatin-embedded Hsp17-CI gene expression as an alternative reporter system (32Bharti K. von Koskull-Döring P. Bharti S. Kumar P. Tintschl-Körbitzer A. Treuter E. Nover L. Plant Cell. 2004; 16: 1521-1535Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar, 33Baniwal S.K. Chan K.Y. Scharf K.D. Nover L. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 3605-3613Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Loss of the DNA binding function (mutants D) had only moderate effects as long as the partner Hsf was wild type (Fig. 3, B and C, lanes 3–5). Similarly, in the GUS reporter assay, the activator domain mutants (A) also showed synergism (even though at a reduced level) as long as the activator domain of one Hsf was wild type (Fig. 3B, lanes 8–10). In contrast, OD deletion mutants showed only the basal reporter activity, because of the activity of the wild type partner Hsf (Fig. 3B; compare samples 1 and 6, samples 11 and 7). Remarkably, the results were similar for both types of reporters, i.e. plasmid-borne GUS and endogenous Hsp17-CI expression. Exceptions were observed with the CTAD mutants where a much more pronounced reduction of synergism was found in the Hsp17-CI-based reporter assay (Fig. 3C, lanes 8 and 9) compared with the GUS activity (Fig. 3B, samples 8 and 9). Evidently, expression of the chromatin-embedded Hsp17-CI genes appears to be more sensitive to the composition of the activator complex. Based on these results, we conclude that the activator and the oligomerization domains are essential for the synergistic gene activation by HsfA1 and HsfA2, whereas an intact DBD is only required for either one of the two partner Hsfs. We next examined the formation of hetero-oligomeric complexes between wild type and mutant forms of HsfA1 and HsfA2. In co-immunoprecipitation assays, HsfA1 was detectable in immunoprecipitates of wild type HsfA2 (Fig. 3D, lane 2), as well as in combinations including DBD (lanes 3–5) and CTAD mutants (lanes 8–10) from both Hsfs. However, no HsfA1 was detectable in immunoprecipitates of the OD deletion mutants (lanes 6 and 7). As expected, hetero-oligomeric complexes were only formed by HsfA1 and HsfA2 forms with intact ODs. An alternative test to show the direct interaction between the two Hsfs in vivo is the nuclear retention assay of HsfA2. HsfA2 shuttles between the nucleus and cytoplasm; but due to its relatively strong NES, the equilibrium is shifted toward a dominant cytoplasmic localization (21Heerklotz D. Döring P. Bonzelius F. Winkelhaus S. Nover L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 1759-1768Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Only for HsfA2-A, but not for the other mutants, a nuclear localization was observed (Fig. 3E, samples 1, 5, 9, and 12). Most likely, in the HsfA2-A mutant, exchange of Leu-341 to Ala in the AHA2 motif (see Fig. 4A) also influences the NES function. To confirm the nucleo-cytoplasmic shuttling, we used leptomycin B (LMB) as inhibitor of nuclear export. In the presence of LMB, wild type HsfA2 and all its mutants showed a dominant nuclear localization (samples 2, 6, and 10). However, nuclear retention of HsfA2 can also be achieved by co-expression of HsfA1 (Ref. 21Heerklotz D. Döring P. Bonzelius F. Winkelhaus S. Nover L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 1759-1768Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, and sample 3 in Fig. 3E). As expected, the nuclear retention of HsfA2 was only slightly affected by mutation of the DNA binding domain even when both Hsf binding mutants, HsfA1-D and HsfA2-D were co-expressed (samples 7 and 8). This confirms that inter"
https://openalex.org/W2065233521,"Background In the search for more potent and safer tuberculosis vaccines, CAF01 was identified as a remarkable formulation. Based on cationic liposomes and including a synthetic mycobacterial glycolipid as TLR-independent immunomodulator, it induces strong and protective T helper-1 and T helper-17 adult murine responses to Ag85B-ESAT-6, a major mycobacterial fusion protein. Here, we assessed whether these properties extend to early life and how CAF01 mediates its adjuvant properties in vivo. Methods/Findings Following adult or neonatal murine immunization, Ag85B-ESAT-6/CAF01 similarly reduced the post-challenge bacterial growth of M. bovis BCG, whereas no protection was observed using Alum as control. This protection was mediated by the induction of similarly strong Th1 and Th17 responses in both age groups. Multifunctional Th1 cells were already elicited after a single vaccine dose and persisted at high levels for at least 6 months even after neonatal priming. Unexpectedly, this potent adjuvanticity was not mediated by a massive targeting/activation of dendritic cells: in contrast, very few DCs in the draining lymph nodes were bearing the labeled antigen/adjuvant. The increased expression of the CD40 and CD86 activation markers was restricted to the minute portion of adjuvant-bearing DCs. However, vaccine-associated activated DCs were recovered several days after immunization. Conclusion The potent adult and neonatal adjuvanticity of CAF01 is associated in vivo with an exquisite but prolonged DC uptake and activation, fulfilling the preclinical requirements for novel tuberculosis vaccines to be used in early life."
https://openalex.org/W2152789876,"The molecular control of cell division and development in malaria parasites is far from understood. We previously showed that a Plasmodium gametocyte-specific NIMA-related protein kinase, nek-4, is required for completion of meiosis in the ookinete, the motile form that develops from the zygote in the mosquito vector. Here, we show that another NIMA-related kinase, Pfnek-2, is also predominantly expressed in gametocytes, and that Pfnek-2 is an active enzyme displaying an in vitro substrate preference distinct from that of Pfnek-4. A functional nek-2 gene is required for transmission of both Plasmodium falciparum and the rodent malaria parasite Plasmodium berghei to the mosquito vector, which is explained by the observation that disruption of the nek-2 gene in P. berghei causes dysregulation of DNA replication during meiosis and blocks ookinete development. This has implications (i) in our understanding of sexual development of malaria parasites and (ii) in the context of control strategies aimed at interfering with malaria transmission. The molecular control of cell division and development in malaria parasites is far from understood.

This has implications (i) in our understanding of sexual development of malaria parasites and (ii) in the context of control strategies aimed at interfering with malaria transmission. Malaria, caused by infection with intracellular protozoan parasites of the genus Plasmodium, is a major public health problem in the developing world (1Breman J.G. Alilio M.S. Mills A. Am. J. Trop. Med. Hyg. 2004; 71: 1-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar). The species responsible for the vast majority of lethal cases is Plasmodium falciparum. The life cycle of malaria parasites consists of a succession of developmental stages: asexual multiplication occurs in the human host (first in a single round of schizogony in a hepatocyte infected by a sporozoite injected by the mosquito vector, and then multiple rounds of schizogony in erythrocytes), whereas the sexual cycle is initiated by the formation of cell cycle-arrested gametocytes in infected erythrocytes and proceeds, in the midgut of the mosquito vector, to gametogenesis, fertilization, and formation of a motile ookinete. The ookinete crosses the midgut epithelium and establishes an oocyst at the basal lamina, in which sporogony occurs, generating sporozoites that render the vector infectious once they reach its salivary glands. The alternation of proliferative and non-proliferative phases implies that the control of cell cycle progression is of prime importance for completion of the life cycle of the parasite. The NIMA-related protein kinases (Neks) 5The abbreviations used are: NekNIMA-related protein kinasesRTreverse transcriptaseMAPKmitogen-activated protein kinaseGFPgreen fluorescent proteinRTreverse transcriptaseDHFRdihydrofolate reductaseTRITCtetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanateUTRuntranslated regionGSTglutathione S-transferaseMBPmyelin basic protein. 5The abbreviations used are: NekNIMA-related protein kinasesRTreverse transcriptaseMAPKmitogen-activated protein kinaseGFPgreen fluorescent proteinRTreverse transcriptaseDHFRdihydrofolate reductaseTRITCtetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanateUTRuntranslated regionGSTglutathione S-transferaseMBPmyelin basic protein. constitute an extended family of eukaryotic mitotic serine/threonine kinases. The best characterized members of the Nek family include NIMA (never in mitosis/Aspergillus), the founding member from the fungus Aspergillus nidulans (2Oakley B.R. Morris N.R. J. Cell Biol. 1983; 96: 1155-1158Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar), and its closest homologue in mammals, Nek2 (3Schultz S.J. Fry A.M. Sutterlin C. Ried T. Nigg E.A.

Initially identified as a kinase essential for mitotic entry in Aspergillus, NIMA has been also shown to participate in nuclear membrane fission (5Davies J.R. Osmani A.H. De Souza C.P. Bachewich C. Osmani S.A. Eukaryot. Cell. 2004; 3: 1433-1444Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Eleven members of the NIMA kinase family (Nek1–11) have now been identified in various human tissues, and together fulfill a number of cell cycle-related functions in centrosome separation, mitosis, meiosis, and checkpoint control (reviewed in Ref. 6O'Regan L. Blot J. Fry A.M. Cell Div. 2007; 2: 25Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It has been proposed that expansion of the Nek family accompanied the evolution of a complex system for the coordination of progression through the cell cycle with the replication of cellular components such as cilia, basal bodies, and centrioles. Several human Neks have C-terminal extensions to their catalytic domain, which contain regulatory elements (e.g. PEST sequences that function as target for cell cycle-dependent proteolytic degradation, or coiled-coil domains mediating dimerization). Nek6 and Nek7 have no large extensions, but bind to the C-terminal non-catalytic tail of Nek9, an enzyme that becomes activated during mitosis and is likely to be responsible for the activation of Nek6 (7Belham C.

This may represent a novel cascade of mitotic NIMA family protein kinases whose combined function is important for mitotic progression.

The P. falciparum kinome includes four NIMA-related serine/threonine kinases (8Ward P. Equinet L. Packer J. Doerig C. BMC Genomics. 2004; 5: 79Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar). Pfnek-1 (PlasmoDB identifier PFL1370w) clusters within the Aspergillus NIMA/human Nek2 branch in phylogenetic trees, whereas clear orthology to mammalian or yeast Neks could not be assigned for the three other P. falciparum sequences (Pfnek-2, -3, and -4, PlasmoDB identifiers PFE1290w, PFL0080c, and MAL7P1.100, respectively) (9Reininger L.

Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 212-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar) indicate that Pfnek-1 is expressed in asexual and sexual stages, whereas mRNA encoding the other three enzymes is predominantly or exclusively expressed in gametocytes, suggesting a possible role in the sexual development of the parasite. Consistent with this hypothesis, we previously showed that rodent malaria parasites Plasmodium berghei lacking the Nek-4 enzyme are unable to complete DNA replication to 4C in the zygote prior to meiosis (9Reininger L. Billker O. Tewari R. Mukhopadhyay A. Fennell C. Dorin-Semblat D. Doerig C. Goldring D. Harmse L. Ranford-Cartwright L. Packer J. Doerig C. J. Biol.

Pfnek-1, -3, and -4 have been characterized at the biochemical level and are active as recombinant enzymes (9Reininger L. Billker O. Tewari R. Mukhopadhyay A. Fennell C. Dorin-Semblat D. Doerig C.

FEBS Lett. 2006; 580: 6083-6092Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Pfnek-1 and Pfnek-3 have surprisingly been implicated as possible regulators of an atypical mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), as both enzymes synergize with the Pfmap-2 MAPK in vitro (12Dorin D. Le Roch K. Sallicandro P. Alano P. Parzy D. Poullet P. Meijer L. Doerig C. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 2600-2608Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 13Lye Y.M. Chan M. Sim T.S. FEBS Lett. 2006; 580: 6083-6092Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar); the physiological relevance of these observations remains to be demonstrated. Here, we demonstrate that Pfnek-2, like the other three members of the P. falciparum Nek family, is a bona fide protein kinase. Analysis of the expression pattern demonstrates that low levels of Pfnek-2 mRNA are actually detectable in asexual parasites, even though transgenic parasites expressing a green fluorescent protein (GFP)-tagged Pfnek-2 under the control of its cognate promoter display female gametocyte-specific expression. To investigate the function of this kinase, parasite clones with a disrupted nek-2 gene were generated in P. falciparum and P. berghei; transmission experiments identified an important role for nek-2 in sexual development: nek-2− parasites are able to differentiate into mature gametocytes and to undergo gametogenesis, but do not develop into ookinetes. Further investigations on the pbnek-2− parasites showed that pre-meiotic DNA replication is dysregulated in the mutant clones. Oligonucleotides (forward, OL10 GGGGGATCCATGTCTAAACCCAAAATG; reverse, OL9 GGGGGTCGACTCAAATTTGGCTATTCCT) were designed to contain the start and stop codons of the full-length, 8-exon Pfnek-2 open reading frame combining the prediction by the Glimmer algorithm and Pf annotation on PlasmoDB (gene identifier PFE1290w), as well as BamHI and SalI restriction sites (underlined), respectively. The open reading frame was amplified from a gametocyte cDNA library (a gift from Pietro Alano) and the 883-bp amplified product was inserted between the BamHI and SalI sites of the pGEX-4T3 vector yielding the plasmid pGEX-Pfnek-2. Catalytically inactive recombinant pGEX-K38M-Pfnek-2 was obtained by site-directed mutagenesis using the overlap extension PCR technique. A similar strategy was used to generate pGEX-T169A-Pfnek-2 mutant. All inserts were verified by DNA sequencing prior to expression of the recombinant proteins in Escherichia coli (strain BL21-CodonPlus). Briefly, cells were grown at 37 °C until an A600 of 0.6 was reached, at which time expression of Pfnek-2 was induced by the addition of 0.2 mm isopropyl β-d-galactoside. Expression was induced for 3 h and then harvested by centrifugation. Purification of wild-type and mutated GST-Pfnek-2 was performed following published procedures (9Reininger L. Billker O. Tewari R. Mukhopadhyay A. Fennell C. Dorin-Semblat D. Doerig C. Goldring D. Harmse L. Ranford-Cartwright L. Packer J. Doerig C. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 31957-31964Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). SDS-PAGE analysis of purified GST-Pfnek-2 revealed a band corresponding to 59 kDa, the predicted molecular mass of the GST-Pfnek-2 fusion protein. Kinase assays were performed in a standard reaction (30 μl) containing 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 15 mm MgCl2, 2 mm MnCl2, 15 mm ATP, 5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol, Amersham Biosciences), and 5 μg of substrate (β-casein, myelin basic protein (MBP), or histone H1 (purchased from Sigma)). Reactions were initiated by the addition of 1 μg of the recombinant wild-type or mutated Pfnek-2. The reaction proceeded for 30 min at 30 °C and was stopped by the addition of Laemmli buffer, boiled for 3 min, and analyzed by electrophoresis on 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. The gels were dried and submitted to autoradiography. Asexual stages of the 3D7 clone of P. falciparum, its F12 subclone, and the 3D7 transfectants described in this paper were grown in human erythrocytes as described previously using Albumax I instead of human serum (14Ringwald P. Meche F.S. Bickii J. Basco L.K. J. Clin. Microbiol. 1999; 37: 700-705Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Gametocytes were prepared according to the protocol of Carter et al. (15Carter R. Ranford-Cartwright L. Alano P. Methods Mol. Biol. 1993; 21: 67-88PubMed Google Scholar). Parasites were released from infected erythrocytes by saponin (0.1% w/v) lysis, washed in phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.5, and kept frozen at −80 °C until use. Total RNA samples were extracted from parasite pellets using TRIzol lysis solution (Invitrogen). DNase treatment of RNA samples prior to RT-PCR was performed by incubation at 37 °C for 30 min using the RQ1 RNase-free DNase purchased from Promega. The DNase was inactivated by incubation at 65 °C for 10 min. RT-PCRs were performed with 500 ng of total RNA/reaction using the ImPromII reverse transcription system purchased from Promega. In control reactions reverse transcriptase was omitted, and only Taq polymerase (TaKaRa) was present. The RT reactions were incubated at 42 °C for 1 h. For the PCR (30 cycles at 94 °C for 45 s, 55 °C for 45 s, and 68 °C for 2 min 30 s), Pfnek-2-specific primers were the forward OL10 and reverse OL9 oligonucleotides described above used for the cloning and expression of the full-length Pfnek-2 open reading frame. For nested PCR (25 cycles at 94 °C for 45 s, 55 °C for 45 s, and 68 °C for 2 min), 1 μl (1/25) of each PCR product was reamplified using the Pfnek-2-specific primers forward OL42 and reverse OL43 oligonucleotides used for construction of the knock-out plasmid described below. Products of both series of reactions were resolved on a 1% agarose gel. The Pfnek-2 disruption plasmid (pCAM-Pfnek-2) was generated by inserting a PCR product corresponding to a central portion of the catalytic domain of the enzyme into the pCAM-BSD vector (a gift from David Fidock), which contains a cassette conferring resistance to blasticidin. The insert was obtained using 3D7 genomic DNA as template and the following oligonucleotides: forward, OL42 GGGGGGATCCTCGTTTGGAATTGTAACTGC; reverse, OL43 GGGGCGGCCGCTGGTGCCATATATCCTA, which contain BamHI and NotI sites (underlined), respectively. The Pfnek-2-GFP plasmid (pCHD-Pfnek-2) was generated by using the pHGB and pCHD-1/2 transfection vectors based on GatewayTM recombinational cloning established by Tonkin et al. (16Tonkin C.J. van Dooren G.G. Spurck T.P. Struck N.S. Good R.T. Handman E. Cowman A.F. McFadden G.I. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2004; 137: 13-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). The ∼1-kb 5′-flanking region of Pfnek-2 was amplified from 3D7 genomic DNA using the forward (GGGTCGACCTATTAGGAAATATGAAG) and reverse (CCAGATCTACTAATATGATTATTCATAC) oligonucleotides containing SalI and BglII sites (underlined), respectively, and inserted into the SalI/BglII sites of pHGB to produce the plasmid pHGB-Pfnek-2 5′. We next amplified the Pfnek-2 open reading frame from the gametocyte cDNA library indicated above and the oligonucleotides forward, CCCAGATCTATGTCTAAACCCAAAATGATAG and reverse, CCCCCTAGGAATTTGGCTATTCCTTTCTTGC, containing BglII and AvrII sites (underlined), respectively. The digested product was ligated into the BglII/AvrII sites of plasmid pHGB-Pfnek-2 5′ to produce the pHGB-Pfnek-2 entry clone. This plasmid was used in a recombination reaction with the pCHD-1/2 destination vector containing the cassette responsible for expression of hDHFR, the gene mediating resistance to WR99210 treatment, to produce the final transfection vector pCHD-Pfnek-2. pCHD-Pfnek-2 contains the full-length Pfnek-2 coding sequence in-frame with the downstream fluorescent reporter GFP gene, driven by its own 5′ promoter region and terminated by the P. berghei DHFR-TS 3′ terminator. Transfections were carried out by electroporation of ring stage 3D7 parasites with 50–100 μg of plasmid DNA, according to Sidhu et al. (17Sidhu A.B. Valderramos S.G. Fidock D.A. Mol. Microbiol. 2005; 57: 913-926Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). Blasticidin (Calbiochem) or WR99210 (Jacobus Pharmaceutical Co., Inc., Princeton, NJ) were added to a final concentration of 2.5 μg/ml and 5 nm, respectively, 48 h after transfection to select for transformed parasites. Resistant parasites appeared after 3–4 weeks and were maintained under drug selection. Subsequent to genotyping indicating that integration occurred at the target locus, Pfnek-2 knock-out parasites were cloned by limiting dilution in 96-well plates for further genotypic and phenotypic analyses. Genotypes of Pfnek-2 knock-out parasites were analyzed by PCR and Southern blotting, using standard procedures. Genomic DNA from transfectants and 3D7 control parasites were extracted from frozen saponin lysis pellets by standard proteinase K digestion in the presence of SDS, phenol/chloroform/isoamyl alcohol (24:24:1) extraction, and ethanol precipitation. Genomic DNA pellets were resuspended in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA (TE) buffer prior to analysis. Disruption of the Pfnek-2 locus was analyzed by diagnostic PCR using various primer pairs. The primer pair OL10/OL9 produced a 1.8-kb fragment corresponding to the undisrupted Pfnek-2 locus only with template from wild-type 3D7. The primer pair OL167 (TATTCCTAATCATGTAAATCTTAAA) and OL168 (CAATTAACCCTCACTAAAG) specific for the pCam-BSD vector, produced a 1.4-kb fragment corresponding to the episome only in pCAM-Pfnek-2 transfectants. Primer pairs OL10/OL168 and OL167/OL9 amplified across the 5′ and 3′ ends of the integration site, giving rise to 1.3- and 1.9-kb products only in the disrupted locus, respectively. For Southern blot analysis, 5 μg of genomic DNA was digested with EcoRI, separated on a 0.7% agarose gel and transferred to Hybond N+ membrane according to the manufacturer's procedures (Amersham Biosciences). The blot was probed with the fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled Pfnek-2 sequence amplified from 3D7 genomic DNA with the primer pair OL42/OL43 (used to produce the Pfnek-2 knock-out construct), and incubated with an anti-fluorescein isothiocyanate monoclonal antibody conjugated to horseradish peroxidase purchased from Amersham Biosciences. Chemoluminescence detection was performed using the Western Lightning Chemoluminescence Reagent Plus detection kit (PerkinElmer) and exposure to imaging Hyperfilm MP (Amersham Biosciences). Parasites expressing GFP were fixed with methanol. Images were captured using a Delta vision deconvolution fluorescence microscope (×100 objective Olympus IX-70) after counterstaining (i) with a rat anti-Pfg377 antibody (a kind gift from Pietro Alano), using a red Alexa Fluor 594-conjugated rabbit anti-rat IgG (H+L) secondary antibody and (ii) with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole. The pattern of microtubules in gametocytes was determined on methanol-fixed parasites stained with a mouse monoclonal antibody specific for chick brain α-tubulin (clone DM1A, purchased from Sigma) and a secondary TRITC-labeled goat anti-mouse IgG (Southern Biotech, Birmingham, AL). Western blot analysis was performed on cell-free extracts prepared by resuspending parasite pellets in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.1% SDS, 0.05% sodium deoxycholate, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and ComplexTM mixture protease inhibitor tablet from Roche Applied Science. 10 μg of each extract were boiled in Laemmli sample buffer, separated on 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gels, and subsequently electrotransferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Bio-Rad). Membranes were blocked in 5% skim milk and Tris-buffered saline containing 0.05% Tween 20 overnight at 4 °C. Immunoblotting was performed using mouse monoclonal anti-GFP antibody (1:5000 dilution) (Roche) and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated sheep anti-mouse antiserum (1/10 000 dilution) (Sigma). Bound antibodies were detected using Western Lightning Chemiluminescence Reagent Plus detection kit (PerkinElmer) and exposure to imaging hyperfilm MP (Amersham Biosciences). Gametocytes of each parasite clone were grown in vitro and fed to Anopheles gambiae mosquitoes through membrane feeders as described previously (15Carter R. Ranford-Cartwright L. Alano P. Methods Mol. Biol. 1993; 21: 67-88PubMed Google Scholar), using medium containing 10% human serum instead of Albumax. Mosquitoes were dissected at 48 h or 10 days post-infection for microscopic analysis of ookinete formation and oocyst infection of the midgut, respectively. pbnek-2−P. berghei (ANKA) parasites were generated by double homologous recombination using the targeting vector pBSDHFR, in which the Toxoplasma gondii dihydrofolate reductase/thymidylate synthase gene (DHFR/TS) is flanked by the upstream and downstream control elements from P. berghei DHFR/TS. A 776-bp fragment of the 5′ UTR of the pbnek-2 gene was amplified from genomic DNA using the following primers (restriction sites are underlined): forward (K0071), GGGGGGTACCTTGGTTCAAAATCATACATAATG; reverse (K0072), GGGGGGGCCCTGCCATTCTTCAATGACTTAT. The amplicon was inserted into pBSDHFR as a KpnI/ApaI fragment upstream of the DHFR/TS cassette. 550 bp of the pbnek-2 3′ UTR were then amplified from genomic DNA using the following primers: forward (K0073), GGGGGGATCCGCCTGATCCACTTCCTAGTA; reverse (K0074), GGGGCCGCGGATTCAATGGACGGACGC. The amplicon was inserted as a BamHI/SacII fragment downstream of the DHFR/TS cassette. The final construct was digested with KpnI and SacII to excise the fragment prior to transfection into P. berghei. A second independent pbnek-2− clone was generated in P. berghei ANKA clone 507 expressing GFP (18Mair G.R. Braks J.A. Garver L.S. Wiegant J.C. Hall N. Dirks R.W. Khan S.M. Dimopoulos G. Janse C.J. Waters A.P. Science. 2006; 313: 667-669Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar). The pyrimethamine-resistant parasites were then cloned by limiting dilution and two independent clones (one from each transfection) were genotyped. For pulsed field gel electrophoresis, chromosomes of wild-type and pbnek-2− clones were separated on an LKB 2015 Pulsaphor system using a linear ramp of 60–500 s for 72 h at 4 V/cm. The gel was blotted and hybridized with a probe that binds to the 3′ UTR of DHFR/TS detecting both the endogenous dhfr locus (chromosome 7) and the modified pbnek-2 locus (chromosome 10). For Southern analysis, genomic DNA from wild-type mutant parasites was digested with EcoRI. The fragments were separated on a 0.8% agarose gel, blotted onto a nylon membrane, and probed with the fragment of the pbnek-2 3′ UTR used in the knock-out vector (see above). We followed procedures similar to those described earlier (9Reininger L. Billker O. Tewari R. Mukhopadhyay A. Fennell C. Dorin-Semblat D. Doerig C. Goldring D. Harmse L. Ranford-Cartwright L.

In short, gamete activation was triggered by treating the parasite-infected blood with 50 μm xanthurenic acid. Zygote formation and ookinete conversion rates were monitored in in vitro cultures by immunolabeling the macrogamete/zygote/ookinete marker P28 as reported earlier (9Reininger L. Billker O. Tewari R. Mukhopadhyay A. Fennell C. Dorin-Semblat D. Doerig C. Goldring D. Harmse L. Ranford-Cartwright L. Packer J. Doerig C. J. Biol.

The stained cells were analyzed on a Leica DMR microscope fitted with an Axiovision digital camera. For mosquito transmission triplicate sets of 50–70 Anopheles stephensi mosquitoes were allowed to feed on anesthetized infected mice on days 3–4 of blood infection for 30 min at 20 °C. Gene prediction algorithms on PlasmoDB proposed conflicting gene structures for Pfnek-2. To resolve this issue, we amplified, cloned, and sequenced the Pfnek-2 open reading frame from a 3D7 gametocyte cDNA library, using primers hybridizing to the most distal of the predicted START and STOP codons. Sequences obtained from 12 clones concurred to show that the 864-bp Pfnek-2 open reading frame comprises eight exons, a gene structure that differs from all gene predictions proposed in PlasmoDB: exons 1 and 2 follow the “Glimmer” prediction, whereas exons 3–8 are as proposed by the Pf annotation. Translation of the Pfnek-2 open reading frame would generate a 286-amino acid, 33.3-kDa protein with a pI of 7.8 (Fig. 1). The 11 subdomains characteristic of serine/threonine protein kinases, as well as most of the key residues that are largely invariant in this family, are conserved in Pfnek-2. In contrast to most Nek family members, Pfnek-2 has a very short (19 amino acids) C-terminal extension with no identified motifs or domains. However, a possible PEST motif (PESTfind score +7.63), targeting proteins to proteolytic degradation, is found within the catalytic domain. Although some Neks have been reported to oligomerize via a coiled-coil domain present in their C-terminal extension, no such sequence is found within Pfnek-2. The Pfnek-2 protein was expressed in E. coli with an N-terminal GST tag. Purified recombinant GST-Pfnek-2 possessed kinase activity, as demonstrated by its ability to autophosphorylate (Fig. 2A) and to phosphorylate exogenous substrates such as myelin basic protein (MBP), histone H1 (Fig. 2B), and β-casein (data not shown). To verify whether the activity was indeed due to GST-Pfnek-2 rather than to a co-purifying contaminant, we showed that a catalytically inactive mutant enzyme (Lys38 → Met) did not yield any signal in the phosphorylation assay. Thus, Pfnek-2 is a genuine protein kinase like Pfnek-4, but displays a different substrate preference (Pfnek-4 is unable to phosphorylate MBP or histone H1 (Fig. 2C and Ref. 9Reininger L. Billker O. Tewari R. Mukhopadhyay A. Fennell C. Dorin-Semblat D. Doerig C. Goldring D. Harmse L. Ranford-Cartwright L. Packer J. Doerig C. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 31957-31964Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Accordingly, kinase assays using heat-inactivated parasite extracts as substrates consistently display different patterns of phosphorylated proteins depending on whether GST-Pfnek-2 or GST-Pfnek-4 is used in the reaction (data not shown). Thr169 is conserved in many protein kinases (including Neks) as the site for activating phosphorylation, and mutant human NEK2 lacking this residue display altered kinase activity (20Rellos P. Ivins F.J. Baxter J.E. Pike A. Nott T.J. Parkinson D.M. Das S. Howell S. Fedorov O. Shen Q.Y. Fry A.M. Knapp S. Smerdon S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 6833-6842Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Likewise, replacement of this threonine with an alanine ablated Pfnek-2 kinase activity, indicating that the amino acid at this position is crucial to enzyme function and suggesting possible regulation by autophosphorylation; the Thr169 residue may also be a target for other upstream kinase(s) in vivo; the corresponding residue in Nek6 (Ser206) has been shown to be the target of phosphorylation by Nek9 (7Belham C.

In this study, we report that scavenger receptor BI (SR-BI), a high density lipoprotein receptor, is a critical survival factor of sepsis. We induced sepsis using an established septic animal model, cecal ligation and puncture (CLP). CLP induced 100% fatality in SR-BI-null mice but only 21% fatality in wild type littermates. SR-BI-null mice exhibited aberrant inflammatory responses with delayed inflammatory cytokine generation at the early stage of sepsis and highly elevated inflammatory cytokine production 20 h after CLP treatment. To understand the mechanisms underlying SR-BI protection, we elucidated the effect of mac ro phage SR-BI on inflammatory cytokine generation. Macrophages from SR-BI-null mice produced significantly higher levels of inflammatory cytokines than those of wild type controls in response to LPS. Importantly, transgenic mice overexpressing SR-BI were more resistant to CLP-induced septic death. Using an HEK-BlueTM cell system, we demonstrated that expression of SR-BI suppressed TLR4-mediated NF-κB activation. To understand why SR-BI-null mice had a delayed inflammatory response, we elucidated the effect of SR-BI on LPS clearance during sepsis. Compared with wild type controls, SR-BI-null mice had lower plasma LPS levels in the early stage of sepsis and elevated plasma LPS levels 20 h following CLP treatment. In conclusion, our findings demonstrate that SR-BI is a critical protective modulator of sepsis in mice.

We recently reported that SR-BI protects against endotoxin-induced animal death through suppression of NO-induced cytotoxicity (22Li X.A. Guo L. Asmis R. Nikolova-Karakashian M. Smart E.J. Circ. Res. 2006; 98: e60-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). A recent study by Cai et al. (26Cai L. Ji A. de Beer F.C. Tannock L.R. van der Westhuyzen D.R. J. Clin. Investig. 2008; 118: 364-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar) confirmed the protective role of SR-BI in LPS-induced animal death, and the authors demonstrated that SR-BI-mediated glucocorticoid synthesis contributes to its protective function. These studies suggest that SR-BI might play a role in sepsis. Interestingly, using in vitro cell culture, Vishnyakova et al. (27Vishnyakova T.G. Kurlander R. Bocharov A.V. Baranova I.N. Chen Z. Abu-Asab M.S. Tsokos M. Malide D. Basso F. Remaley A. Csako G. Eggerman T.L. Patterson A.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2006; 103: 16888-16893Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) reported recently that SR-BI enhances the uptake of Gram-negative bacteria, which raises a possibility that this SR-BI-mediated bacterial uptake may facilitate bacterial infection and therefore play a deleterious role in sepsis. Given the limitations of endotoxemia animal model (28Eskandari M.K. Bolgos G. Miller C. Nguyen D.T. DeForge L.E. Remick D.G. J. Immunol. 1992; 148: 2724-2730PubMed Google Scholar), it is of importance to determine whether and how SR-BI plays a protective role in sepsis. In this study, we assessed the role of SR-BI in sepsis using an established septic animal model, cecal ligation and puncture (CLP). We demonstrated that SR-BI is a critical survival factor of sepsis in mice. In contrast to significant protection against LPS-induced animal death by SR-BI-mediated corticosterone generation, corticosterone did not provide protection against CLP-induced septic animal death, indicating that SR-BI has other functions than regulating corticosterone production in sepsis. Using a transgenic animal model, primary macrophages, and HEK-Blue cell system, we demonstrated that SR-BI modulates inflammatory response in macrophages via TLR4 signaling, which contributes to protection against septic death. Anti-SR-BI serum was custom made by Sigma Genosys using a 15-amino acid peptide derived from the C-terminal of human SR-BI. LPS (E. coli serotype K12) was from InvivoGen. Endo-low fetal bovine serum was from Hyclone. Macrophage colony stimulate factor was from R&D Systems. Corticosterone was from Sigma. Blood agar plate (MacConkey II) was from BD Biosciences. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kits for quantifying tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and IL-6 were from eBioscience. Competitive ELISA kit for quantifying mouse cortisol or corticosterone and nitrite/nitrate (NOx) kit were from Cayman Chemical. An ELISA kit for quantifying LPS was from Charles River. SR-BI+/− mice on C57BL/6 × 129 background were obtained from Jackson Laboratories. SR-BI−/−, SR-BI+/−, and SR-BI+/+ littermates were generated by breeding SR-BI+/− mice. Mouse tail DNA was used for PCR genotyping. The animals were fed with a standard laboratory chow diet. Animal care and experiments were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the University of Kentucky. C323G mutated SR-BI cDNA was generated and subcloned into a pCAGGS vector as described previously (21Li X.A. Guo L. Dressman J.L. Asmis R. Smart E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 19087-19096Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The transgenic mice in a C57BL/6xCBA background were generated by the Transgenic Core Facility of Mayo Clinic (Scottsdale, AZ). Transgenic mice were selected by PCR using tail DNA. The transgenic mice were crossed to SR-BI-null mice to generate transgenic and nontransgenic littermates in an SR-BI-null background. The breeders were fed with 0.1% probucol to correct female infertility. CLP was performed as described by Wesche-Soldato et al. (29Wesche-Soldato D.E. Chung C.S. Lomas-Neira J. Doughty L.A. Gregory S.H. Ayala A. Blood. 2005; 106: 2295-2301Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Briefly, 10- to 12-week-old mice were anesthetized by inhalation of 2–5% isoflurane in 100% oxygen using anesthesia equipment. A midline incision (1.0 cm) was made below the diaphragm. The cecum was isolated, ligated, punctured twice with a 22-gauge needle, and gently compressed to extrude a small amount of cecal material. The cecum was returned to the abdomen, and the muscle and skin incisions were closed with 6–0 Ethilon suture material. The mice were subsequently resuscitated with 1 ml phosphate-buffered saline subcutaneously. Sham animals were similarly treated without ligation/puncture of the cecum. Survival was monitored for a 5-day period. 10- to 12-week-old mice were euthanized by CO2 inhalation 2, 4, 8, and 20 h following CLP. The blood was obtained by cardiac puncture or tail bleed and stored at −80 °C. The serum alanine aminotransferase levels were quantified with the Analyst Chemistry system, which was used to determine the degree of liver damage; the serum nitrite/nitrate (NOx) levels were measured with a nitrite/nitrate kit, which was used to estimate the generation of NO in vivo; and the serum TNF-α, IL-6, corticosterone, or LPS levels were quantified with corresponding ELISA kits. Corticosterone was administered to 10- to 12-week-old SR-BI-null mice following the method described by Cai et al. (26Cai L. Ji A. de Beer F.C. Tannock L.R. van der Westhuyzen D.R. J. Clin. Investig. 2008; 118: 364-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Then the CLP was performed, and survival was monitored for a 5-day period. Bone marrow-derived macrophages were cultured as described previously (30Berwin B. Hart J.P. Rice S. Gass C. Pizzo S.V. Post S.R. Nicchitta C.V. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 6127-6136Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). Briefly, bone marrow cells were cultured in a 6-well plate at 2 × 106 cells/well in RPMI 1640 medium containing 20% fetal bovine serum and 25 ng/ml of mouse macrophage colony stimulate factor for 6 days. The medium was changed daily. For measurement of cytokines, the cells were incubated in phosphate-buffered saline for 2 h and treated with LPS at 0, 0.25, 0.5, and 1 ng/ml for 2, 4, 8, and 20 h in RPMI 1640 medium containing 20% fetal bovine serum, and cytokines in the culture supernatant were quantified with the corresponding ELISA kit. HEK-Blue cells, which stably express TLR4, CD14, MD2, and a NF-κB reporter, were from InvivoGen. The HEK-Blue cells were transfected with wild type SR-BI, C323G mutant SR-BI cDNA, or pLNCX2 vector and mixed clones stably expressing SR-BI, SR-BIC323G, or vector were obtained by G418 selection. HEK-Blue cells stably expressing SR-BI, SR-BIC323G, or pLNCX2 vector were cultured in a 96-well plate in complete Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 0.5 mg/ml G418 and 10% Endo-low fetal bovine serum to 90% confluency and treated with LPS at 0, 0.5, 1, and 2 ng/ml for 16 h. Then, 100 μl of the culture supernatant was mixed with 100 μl HEK-Blue detection medium and incubated at 37 °C for 1 h. LPS activates TLR4, resulting in induction of NF-κB reporter expression, which catalyzes the HEK-Blue detection medium to blue. The blue color was quantified by measuring absorption at 650 nm. Serum (50 μl) was resolved by gel filtration chromatography with fast protein liquid chromatography equipped with a Superose 6 column (GE Healthcare). The column was eluted at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min in buffer containing 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.4, 0.01% sodium azide, and 0.5 ml/fraction was collected. One hundred microliters of sample was mixed with 100 μl of 2× assay reagent to determine the cholesterol content of fractions (Wako Chemicals). Blood was diluted (100 and 1,000 times with phosphate-buffered saline), and 200 μl of the diluted blood was plated on a MacConkey II agar plate. After a 24-h incubation at 37° C, the number of purple clones was counted. qPCR analysis was employed to quantify the number of bacteria in the liver following the method described by Steinman et al. (31Steinman C.R. Muralidhar B. Nuovo G.J. Rumore P.M. Yu D. Mukai M. Anal. Biochem. 1997; 244: 328-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Total DNA was isolated from 30 mg of liver using a DNeasy kit (Qiagen). qPCR was performed with bacteria-specific primers (forward, 5′-GAGGAAGGIGIGGAIGACGT; reverse, 5′-AGGAGGTGATCCAACCGCA) using a knowing number of DH-5α bacteria as standard. The survival assay was analyzed by a Log-Rank x2 test using SAS software. Comparing two groups, significance in experiments was determined by 2-tailed Student's t test. Significance in experiments comparing more than two groups was evaluated by one-way analysis of variance, followed by post hoc analysis using Tukey's test. Means were considered different at p < 0.05. We employed a well established CLP sepsis model to determine whether SR-BI is required for protection against bacteria-induced septic death. As shown in Fig. 1a, mice deficient in SR-BI were significantly more susceptible to CLP-induced septic death. CLP treatment induced 19% fatality in SR-BI-null mice and 5% in wild type littermates at 24 h, 90% fatality in SR-BI-null mice and 10% in wild type littermates at 48 h, and 100% fatality in SR-BI-null mice but only 21% fatality in wild type littermates at 72 h. SR-BI-mediated protection against CLP-induced liver injury was assessed by measuring serum alanine aminotransferase levels. Compared with wild type controls, SR-BI-null mice had a significant increase in serum alanine aminotransferase levels (Fig. 1b) 20 h following CLP treatment. These findings indicate that SR-BI is a critical survival factor in sepsis. A rapid innate immune response that generates high levels of inflammatory cytokines constitutes the first line of the self-defense system against bacterial infections. However, uncontrolled production of cytokines is a major cause of septic death (32Cohen J. Nature. 2002; 420: 885-891Crossref PubMed Scopus (2179) Google Scholar). To understand why SR-BI-null mice are susceptible to septic death, we assessed inflammatory cytokine production in CLP-treated SR-BI-null and wild type littermates. We treated the mice with CLP for 2, 4, 8, and 20 h and then determined the serum cytokine levels. As shown in Fig. 2, SR-BI-null and wild type mice exhibited distinct inflammatory responses during sepsis. Wild type mice exhibited a typical acute phase response with a rapid and strong induction of TNF-α and IL-6 in the early stage of sepsis (2–8 h) with significant decreases in TNF-α and IL-6 levels by 20 h. However, SR-BI-null mice exhibited an aberrant pattern of inflammatory cytokine generation during sepsis. Four h after CLP treatment, although serum TNF-α and IL-6 levels increased in SR-BI-null mice, the increases were significantly less than that of wild type control mice, indicating a delayed immune response in SR-BI-null mice. Interestingly, in contrast to the decrease in cytokine levels in wild type mice 20 h after CLP treatment, the serum TNF-α and IL-6 levels continued to increase in SR-BI-null mice, indicating a prolonged and uncontrolled cytokine generation in the late stage of sepsis in the absence of SR-BI (Fig. 2, a and b). Similar to cytokines, NO is another key molecule in innate immune response during sepsis (33Titheradge M.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1411: 437-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar). Upon bacterial infections, inducible nitric-oxide synthase expression in macrophages is induced to generate a high level of NO, which is used to kill bacteria and modulate immune reactions (33Titheradge M.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1411: 437-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar). However, too much NO is deleterious and can cause oxidative cell damage (34Beckman J.S. Koppenol W.H. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: C1424-1437Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We measured serum nitrite and nitrate (NOx) levels to determine whether SR-BI affects NO production in sepsis. As shown in Fig. 2c, SR-BI-null mice exhibited an aberrant pattern of NO generation during sepsis. In contrast to an increase in NO generation in the early stage of sepsis in wild type mice, the NO generation in SR-BI-null mice was significantly less than that of wild type controls, indicating a delayed NO generation in SR-BI-null mice. Furthermore, unlike the gradual decrease in NOx levels in the late stage of sepsis in wild type mice, the serum NOx levels in SR-BI-null mice reached the peak at 8 h and remained high at 20 h, indicating a prolonged NO generation in the late stage of sepsis in the absence of SR-BI. SR-BI is highly expressed in adrenal glands. It mediates the intracellular uptake of cholesterol from HDL in adrenal glands, thus providing substrate for corticosteroid synthesis (35Krieger M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 523-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar). A recent study by Cai et al. (26Cai L. Ji A. de Beer F.C. Tannock L.R. van der Westhuyzen D.R. J. Clin. Investig. 2008; 118: 364-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar) showed that SR-BI-null mice have a defect in inducible corticosterone generation in LPS-challenged mice, and supplementation of corticosterone to LPS-challenged SR-BI-null mice rescues the mice from endotoxic death, indicating that SR-BI-mediated corticosterone production contributes to its protection against endotoxic animal death. We elucidated the effect of SR-BI on corticosteroid generation during sepsis by measuring serum corticosterone levels. As expected, CLP induced a 4-fold increase in corticosterone generation in wild type mice 4 h following CLP treatment (SR-BI+/+ basal, 198 ± 55 ng/ml versus SR-BI+/+ CLP, 830 ± 189 ng/ml), but mice deficient in SR-BI failed to generate any inducible corticosterone during sepsis (SR-BI−/− basal, 165 ± 33 ng/ml versus SR-BI−/− CLP, 160 ± 67 ng/ml) (Fig. 3a), indicating that SR-BI is required for inducible corticosterone production during sepsis. To determine whether this SR-BI-mediated corticosterone production contributes to its protection against septic death, we administered corticosterone in drinking water to SR-BI-null mice 8 h prior to CLP treatment following the method described by Cai et al. (26Cai L. Ji A. de Beer F.C. Tannock L.R. van der Westhuyzen D.R. J. Clin. Investig. 2008; 118: 364-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Unexpectedly, in contrast to significant protection against LPS-induced endotoxic animal death by corticosterone (26Cai L. Ji A. de Beer F.C. Tannock L.R. van der Westhuyzen D.R. J. Clin. Investig. 2008; 118: 364-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar), corticosterone supplementation failed to protect SR-BI-null mice from CLP-induced septic death (Fig. 3b). The data clearly indicate that SR-BI is required for inducible corticosterone production during sepsis, but this SR-BI-mediated inducible corticosterone production is not responsible for protection against septic death. We then looked for an alternative explanation for SR-BI protection against septic death. Considering that SR-BI is expressed in macrophages and that macrophages are one of the major types of cells that generate inflammatory cytokines during sepsis (36Su G.L. Am. J. Physiol. Gastrointest. Liver Physiol. 2002; 283: G256-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar, 37Uesugi T. Froh M. Arteel G.E. Bradford B.U. Thurman R.G. Hepatology. 2001; 34: 101-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar), we determined whether SR-BI directly affects cytokine production using bone marrow-derived macrophages. We treated the macrophages with 0.5 ng/ml LPS and quantified TNF-α and IL-6 production. Wild type and SR-BI-null macrophages exhibited distinct inflammatory responses to LPS stimuli (Fig. 4, b and c). For wild type macrophages, TNF-α production reached its maximum level by 4 h, and IL-6 production reached its maximum level by 8 h. However, for SR-BI-null macrophages, the TNF-α and IL-6 levels continued to rise and surpassed cytokine levels of wild type macrophages by 20 h, indicating uncontrolled TNF-α and IL-6 generation in macrophages deficient in SR-BI. We also treated the macrophages with various amounts of LPS. In the presence of pathological levels of LPS, LPS induced the generation of TNF-α and IL-6 in an LPS dose-dependent manner, and the presence of SR-BI effectively suppressed the generation of TNF-α and IL-6 (Fig. 4, d and e). We used SR-BI transgenic mice to determine whether expression of SR-BI in macrophages contributes to protection against septic death. In using this approach, an important consideration is our ability to distinguish the effect of SR-BI on modulating inflammatory response in macrophages from its effects on inducing apoptosis, protecting NO-induced cytotoxicity, and regulating corticosterone generation. To address the problem, we used the C323G mutant SR-BI. Our early studies indicated that this mutated SR-BI loses its apoptotic activity and anti-NO activity completely (21Li X.A. Guo L. Dressman J.L. Asmis R. Smart E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 19087-19096Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 22Li X.A. Guo L. Asmis R. Nikolova-Karakashian M. Smart E.J.

Graf, A. Daugherty, and X.-A. Li, unpublished data. Therefore, the C323G mutant SR-BI is a unique tool to determine the contribution of the macrophage SR-BI to sepsis. We generated the SR-BIC323G transgenic mice and bred the mice with SR-BI-null mice to generate SR-BIC323G transgenic mice in an SR-BI-null background (Fig. 5, a and b). We isolated bone marrow cells from the transgenic and nontransgenic littermates and confirmed the expression of SR-BIC323G in bone marrow-derived macrophages (Fig. 5c). Then, we determined the effect of SR-BIC323G on inflammatory cytokine generation using bone marrow-derived macrophages. As expected, the expression of the C323G mutant SR-BI in macrophages significantly suppressed the generation of TNF-α or IL-6 as compared with nontransgenic SR-BI-null mice (Fig. 5, d and e). Finally, we challenged the transgenic mice with CLP. As shown in Fig. 5, f and g, SR-BIC323G transgenic mice did not exhibit a significant difference in plasma corticosterone levels during sepsis but were significantly more resistant to CLP-induced septic death when compared with nontransgenic SR-BI-null mice. TLR4 is a key signaling molecule that mediates inflammatory response in macrophages during sepsis (38Poltorak A. He X. Smirnova I. Liu M.Y. Van Huffel C. Du X. Birdwell D. Alejos E. Silva M. Galanos C. Freudenberg M. Ricciardi-Castagnoli P. Layton B. Beutler B. Science. 1998; 282: 2085-2088Crossref PubMed Scopus (6477) Google Scholar, 39Raetz C.R. Whitfield C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2002; 71: 635-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (3423) Google Scholar). LPS released from Gram-negative bacteria activates TLR4 to initiate a downstream signaling cascade, leading to the activation of NF-κB, which then activates the transcription of inflammatory genes such as TNF-α, IL-6, and inducible nitric-oxide synthase (39Raetz C.R. Whitfield C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2002; 71: 635-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (3423) Google Scholar, 40Carmody R.J. Chen Y.H. Cell Mol. Immunol. 2007; 4: 31-41PubMed Google Scholar). We tested whether SR-BI modulates inflammatory response via TLR4 signaling using a HEK-Blue cell system. The HEK-Blue cell system stably expresses TLR4, CD14, MD2, and the NF-κB reporter, so it is a convenient system to elucidate TLR4 signaling. We generated HEK-Blue cells that stably express SR-BI or vector (Fig. 6a). As shown in Fig. 6b, LPS induced activation of NF-κB in an LPS dose-dependent manner. Importantly, the presence of SR-BI significantly suppressed LPS-stimulated NF-κB activation, indicating that SR-BI can modulate TLR4-mediated inflammatory signaling. We also generated HEK-Blue cells stably expressing SR-BIC323G (Fig. 6a). Similar to wild type SR-BI, the C323G mutant SR-BI effectively suppressed TLR4-mediated NF-κB activation (Fig. 6c). Lipoproteins, especially HDL, have been shown to bind LPS and neutralize LPS toxicity (41Ulevitch R.J. Johnston A.R. Weinstein D.B. J. Clin.

In this proof of concept study, human subjects coordinate hand movements with a virtual partner, an avatar of a hand whose movements are driven by a computerized version of the Haken-Kelso-Bunz (HKB) equations that have been shown to govern basic forms of human coordination. As a surrogate system for human social coordination, VPI allows one to examine regions of the parameter space not typically explored during live interactions. A number of novel behaviors never previously observed are uncovered and accounted for. Having its basis in an empirically derived theory of human coordination, VPI offers a principled approach to human-machine interaction and opens up new ways to understand how humans interact with human-like machines including identification of underlying neural mechanisms."
https://openalex.org/W2061051947,"Huntington disease (HD) is a neurodegenerative disorder caused by an expansion of a polyglutamine (polyQ) domain in the N-terminal region of huntingtin (htt). PolyQ expansion above 35-40 results in disease associated with htt aggregation into inclusion bodies. It has been hypothesized that expanded polyQ domains adopt multiple potentially toxic conformations that belong to different aggregation pathways. Here, we used atomic force microscopy to analyze the effect of a panel of anti-htt antibodies (MW1-MW5, MW7, MW8, and 3B5H10) on aggregate formation and the stability of a mutant htt-exon1 fragment. Two antibodies, MW7 (polyproline-specific) and 3B5H10 (polyQ-specific), completely inhibited fibril formation and disaggregated preformed fibrils, whereas other polyQ-specific antibodies had widely varying effects on aggregation. These results suggest that expanded polyQ domains adopt multiple conformations in solution that can be readily distinguished by monoclonal antibodies, which has important implications for understanding the structural basis for polyQ toxicity and the development of intrabody-based therapeutics for HD."
https://openalex.org/W2010862523,"Hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1) is a central regulator of the hypoxic response in many cell types. In endothelial cells, HIF-1 induces the expression of key proangiogenic factors to promote angiogenesis. Recent studies have identified Kruppel-like factor 2 (KLF2) as a potent inhibitor of angiogenesis. However, the role of KLF2 in regulating HIF-1 expression and function has not been evaluated. KLF2 expression was induced acutely by hypoxia in endothelial cells. Adenoviral overexpression of KLF2 inhibited hypoxia-induced expression of HIF-1alpha and its target genes such as interleukin 8, angiopoietin-2, and vascular endothelial growth factor in endothelial cells. Conversely, knockdown of KLF2 increased expression of HIF-1alpha and its targets. Furthermore, KLF2 inhibited hypoxia-induced endothelial tube formation, whereas endothelial cells from mice with haploinsufficiency of KLF2 showed increased tube formation in response to hypoxia. Consistent with this ex vivo observation, KLF2 heterozygous mice showed increased microvessel density in the brain. Mechanistically, KLF2 promoted HIF-1alpha degradation in a von Hippel-Lindau protein-independent but proteasome-dependent manner. Finally, KLF2 disrupted the interaction between HIF-1alpha and its chaperone Hsp90, suggesting that KLF2 promotes degradation of HIF-1alpha by affecting its folding and maturation. These observations identify KLF2 as a novel inhibitor of HIF-1alpha expression and function. Therefore, KLF2 may be a target for modulating the angiogenic response in disease states."

There are at least 20 members of this subfamily of Ras-like GTPases in humans, and although many have been studied in great detail, the so-called atypical Rho GTPase subset are much less well understood (Salas-Vidal et al., 2005Salas-Vidal E.

Three atypical Rho GTPases, RhoBTB1, 2, and 3, are much larger (67–83 kDa) than conventional Rho proteins and are comprised of N-terminal, Rho-related domains followed by one or more BTB (Bric-a-brac, Tramtrack, Broad-complex) domains (Figure 1; Ramos et al., 2002Ramos S.

BTB domains are found in about 200 proteins and are thought to mediate protein:protein interactions. RhoBTB1 and RhoBTB2 show 79% similarity in sequence and are likely orthologs of the single RhoBTB that is present in Dictyostelium, Drosophila, and Anopheles (Ramos et al., 2002Ramos S. Khademi F.

RhoBTB2 has attracted attention as a tumor suppressor that is downregulated in several tumor types (Hamaguchi et al., 2002Hamaguchi M. Meth J.L. von Klitzing C. Wei W. Esposito D. Rodgers L. Walsh T. Welcsh P. King M.C. Wigler M.H. DBC2, a candidate for a tumor suppressor gene involved in breast cancer.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Carpenter C.L. RhoBTB2 is a substrate of the mammalian Cul3 ubiquitin ligase complex.Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 856-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar have proposed that RhoBTB2 acts as a tumor suppressor by recruiting substrates to a Cul3 ubiquitin ligase complex for degradation.

DBC2 is essential for transporting vesicular stomatitis virus glycoprotein.J. Mol. Biol. 2006; 364: 302-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), and both RhoBTB1 and 2 are associated with what appear to be late endosomes or lysosomes in cultured cells (Aspenström et al., 2004Aspenström P. Fransson A. Saras J. Rho GTPases have diverse effects on the organization of the actin filament system.Biochem. J. 2004; 377: 327-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). RhoBTB3 is likely to play a different role than RhoBTB1 and 2, as it is the most divergent of the three RhoBTB proteins (only ∼48% similar to RhoBTB1 and 2), and residues that are key for RhoBTB2-Cul3 interaction (including Y248) are not present in RhoBTB3 (but see Berthold et al., 2008bBerthold J.

Moreover, RhoBTB3 is only found in vertebrates but, like RhoBTB1, appears to be expressed in all tissues analyzed (Ramos et al., 2002Ramos S. Khademi F. Somesh B.P. Rivero F.

Cell Biol. 2008; 180: 159-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). As part of our ongoing efforts to elucidate the molecular mechanism of this trafficking pathway, we carried out a yeast two-hybrid screen to identify gene products that interact preferentially with Rab9-GTP (Reddy et al., 2006Reddy J. Burguete A.S. Sridevi K. Ganley I. Nottingham R.M. Pfeffer S.R. A role for GCC185 in mannose 6-phosphate receptor recycling.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2006; 17: 4353-4363Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). We report here the characterization of a novel Rab9 effector identified in that screen: RhoBTB3. To our surprise, this protein turns out to be a Rab9-regulated ATPase, rather than a GTPase, that participates in transport vesicle docking at the Golgi complex. RhoBTB3 is a 611 amino acid protein that contains a Rho GTPase-related domain near its N terminus and a BTB domain near its C terminus, as annotated by the conserved domain database (Marchler-Bauer et al., 2007Marchler-Bauer A. Anderson J.B. Derbyshire M.K. DeWeese-Scott C. Gonzales N.R. Gwadz M. Hao L. He S. Hurwitz D.I. Jackson J.D. et al.CDD: a conserved domain database for interactive domain family analysis.Nucleic Acids Res. 2007; 35: D237-D240Crossref PubMed Scopus (657) Google Scholar) (Figure 1A). The related RhoBTB1 and RhoBTB2 proteins are shown for comparison (Figures 1A and 1B). The Rho domains of these two proteins are more closely related to the canonical RhoA protein (37% and 39%, respectively). In addition, they appear to have a remnant of a second BTB domain, although sequence similarity algorithms that include structural information, such as the conserved domain architecture retrieval tool (Marchler-Bauer et al., 2007Marchler-Bauer A. Anderson J.B. Derbyshire M.K. DeWeese-Scott C. Gonzales N.R. Gwadz M. Hao L. He S. Hurwitz D.I. Jackson J.D. et al.CDD: a conserved domain database for interactive domain family analysis.Nucleic Acids Res. 2007; 35: D237-D240Crossref PubMed Scopus (657) Google Scholar), indicate that each of these proteins contains only one intact BTB motif. Unlike RhoBTBs 1 and 2, RhoBTB3′s C-terminal sequence terminates in a consensus prenylation sequence, CAAX. RhoBTB3 was identified in a yeast two-hybrid screen for Rab9-GTP-interacting proteins. Binding was quantified by liquid culture analysis: full-length RhoBTB3 interacted with the GTP conformation of Rab9 (Rab9Q66L) but not a mutant Rab9 that binds GDP with 50-fold preference to GTP (Rab9S21N; Riederer et al., 1994Riederer M.A. Soldati T. Shapiro A.D. Lin J. Pfeffer S.R. Lysosome biogenesis requires mannose 6-phosphate receptor recycling from endosomes to the trans Golgi network.J. Cell Biol. 1994; 125: 573-582Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar) (Figure 2A). Binding was also specific, as no interaction was seen for the activated mutant forms of Rabs 5 (Rab5 Q79L) or 7 (Rab7 Q67L). Subsequent analysis of 54 different Rab GTPases confirmed binding specificity: only Rab9A and, to a lesser extent, Rab9B showed interaction with RhoBTB3 (Figure S1 available online). We will focus here on Rab9A (“Rab9”). Truncation constructs were generated to identify the precise Rab9-binding site within RhoBTB3. As shown in Figure 2B, the Rab9-binding site was localized to the C-terminal region of the protein, as residues 420–611 were sufficient to yield full β-galactosidase activation in the two-hybrid system. To verify that the binding observed in yeast was due to a direct protein:protein interaction, we tested the ability of purified GST-RhoBTB3 C-terminal residues 420–611 to bind purified Rab proteins. Rabs were preloaded with GTPγ-[35S] or [3H]-GDP and then incubated with RhoBTB3; bound proteins were collected on glutathione beads and counted in a scintillation counter. As shown in Figure 2C, RhoBTB3 bound saturably to Rab9 but not Rab5, and binding showed strong preference for Rab9-GTP (Figure 2D). Error-prone PCR mutagenesis was carried out to further define RhoBTB3 residues important for Rab9 binding; mutated constructs were screened for loss of interaction by two-hybrid analysis and then sequenced directly. These screens suggested that Rab9 interaction required A498, D532, or I533 (Figure 1B) as their mutation abolished binding in the two-hybrid system (not shown). The D532E mutation was of particular interest, as that residue is a glutamic acid in RhoBTB2. The importance of D532 for Rab9 binding was demonstrated directly: purified RhoBTB3 D532E protein (2E gel inset) showed significantly less binding to Rab9 than wild-type protein, confirming the importance of this region of the protein in Rab9 interaction (Figure 2E). RhoBTB3 is localized to the Golgi complex, as determined by indirect immunofluorescence of myc-RhoBTB3 transfected cells, using the proteins TGN46 or GCC185 as endogenous Golgi marker proteins (Figure S2; see also Berthold et al., 2008bBerthold J. Schenkova K. Ramos S. Miura Y. Furukawa M. Aspenström P. Rivero F. Characterization of RhoBTB-dependent Cul3 ubiquitin ligase complexes-Evidence for an autoregulatory mechanism.Exp. Cell Res. 2008; 314: 3453-3465Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Confirmation of this localization was obtained by disruption of the microtubule-based cytoskeleton using nocodazole. Under these conditions, the Golgi fragments into mini-stacks that distribute throughout the cytoplasm. The Golgi marker, TGN46, showed complete colocalization with RhoBTB3 under control and nocodazole conditions. Thus, myc-RhoBTB3 appears to be Golgi associated. Unfortunately it was not possible to detect endogenous RhoBTB3 by light microscopy using two separate rabbit antisera raised against recombinant RhoBTB3 protein; these only detected endogenous protein by immunoblot. The localization of RhoBTB3 to the Golgi did not require C-terminal residues that could potentially be prenylated, as a ΔCAAX mutant was not altered in its subcellular localization (see below). In addition, Rab9 does not determine RhoBTB3′s Golgi association as most Rab9 is not found on the Golgi, and a mutant form of RhoBTB3 (D532E) that cannot bind Rab9 is normally localized (see below). Because of the close link between Rho GTPases and the actin cytoskeleton, we first tested whether depletion or overexpression of RhoBTB3 altered the appearance of either actin or microtubules. Superficial examination of light micrographs did not reveal any significant changes (not shown). To try to determine RhoBTB3′s function, we took advantage of the clue that it binds to Rab9 GTPase. Rab9, and each of its effectors that have been studied to date (p40, GCC185, TIP47), are required for the recycling of MPRs from endosomes to the TGN. To test if RhoBTB3 is also involved in this process, we used siRNA-mediated protein depletion and monitored the distribution of MPRs in siRNA-transfected cells. MPRs normally display a tight perinuclear localization, adjacent to the Golgi complex (Figure 3A, left panel). When another Golgi-localized Rab9 effector, GCC185, is depleted from cells, MPRs accumulate in peripheral, Rab9-positive transport intermediates (Reddy et al., 2006Reddy J. Burguete A.S. Sridevi K. Ganley I. Nottingham R.M. Pfeffer S.R. A role for GCC185 in mannose 6-phosphate receptor recycling.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2006; 17: 4353-4363Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). This has implicated GCC185 as a tethering factor in this transport process. Upon siRNA depletion of RhoBTB3, MPRs appeared in small dispersed vesicles throughout the cytoplasm, reminiscent of the phenotype observed upon GCC185 depletion (Figures 3A and 3B; Reddy et al., 2006Reddy J. Burguete A.S. Sridevi K. Ganley I. Nottingham R.M. Pfeffer S.R. A role for GCC185 in mannose 6-phosphate receptor recycling.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2006; 17: 4353-4363Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). The phenotype was quantified by determining the percent of total MPR intensity detected at various distances from the center of intensity. Using this metric, the distribution of MPRs in depleted cells (Figure 3C, dark bars) was demonstrably broader than in control cells (Figure 3C, light bars). Although GCC185 was slightly altered in its appearance (see below), the Golgi remained intact in cells depleted of RhoBTB3 (Figure 3B). In contrast to GCC185 and analogous to MPRs, TGN46 proteins were also broadly distributed (Figures 3A and 3D). It is important to note that unlike GCC185, TGN46 cycles between endosomes and the Golgi. These data suggest that RhoBTB3 is needed for the retrograde transport of both MPRs and TGN46 to the Golgi complex; in its absence, cycling proteins are unable to return. If RhoBTB3 functions in transport vesicle tethering, cells depleted of this protein should accumulate MPRs in Rab9-positive transport intermediates. To test this, cells stably expressing GFP-Rab9 were depleted of RhoBTB3 and the localization of MPRs and Rab9 GTPase in peripheral vesicles was quantified. As shown in Figure 3E, a large proportion of peripheral, small vesicles carrying MPRs were indeed Rab9 positive (>80%). These structures were not early or recycling endosomes as they did not contain fluorescent transferrin, endocytosed for 15 min (Figure S3), or the early endosome marker, EEA1 protein (Figure 3E). The accumulation of MPRs in Rab9-positive structures that are not early endosomes is consistent with a role for RhoBTB3 in transport vesicle tethering at the Golgi complex. In addition, ∼95% of dispersed TGN46 was not in the same vesicles as MPRs, consistent with their accumulation in a different type of transport vesicle carrier (Figure 3E). Unlike MPRs, TGN46 recycling requires Syntaxin 6 (Ganley et al., 2008Ganley I.G. Espinosa E. Pfeffer S.R. A Syntaxin 10-containing SNARE complex distinguishes two distinct transport routes from endosomes to the trans Golgi network.J.

Given the distinct biochemical requirements for TGN46 recycling, its accumulation in a distinct type of vesicle is not unexpected; however both TGN46 and MPRs require RhoBTB3 function upon arrival at the Golgi complex. Careful examination of cells depleted of RhoBTB3 showed that the Golgi (monitored by GCC185 localization) appeared somewhat enlarged compared with control cells. This was quantified by determining the number of pixels occupied by the Golgi marker under various conditions (Figure 4A). In control cells, GCC185 occupied 2889 ± 109 pixels per cell (n = 210). In depleted cells, this almost doubled to 5764 ± 453 pixels per cell (n = 44), even though overall cell size remained unchanged. A similar expansion was seen for the Golgi marker, p115 (data not shown). Expression of the RhoBTB3 N138D mutant that cannot bind nucleotide (see below) caused a smaller increase in Golgi area (4195 ± 323 [n = 60]), but expression of wild-type RhoBTB3 did not (Figure 4A). For comparison, depletion of GCC185, which causes the Golgi to fragment into mini-stacks (Reddy et al., 2006Reddy J. Burguete A.S. Sridevi K. Ganley I. Nottingham R.M. Pfeffer S.R. A role for GCC185 in mannose 6-phosphate receptor recycling.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2006; 17: 4353-4363Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), did not change the overall area occupied by the Golgi complex, as monitored by the area occupied by Golgin-245 protein (Figure 4A). Thus, RhoBTB3 also contributes to the overall structure of the Golgi complex. Consistent with a role in MPR transport, cells depleted of RhoBTB3 showed a 2-fold increase in the secretion of the lysosomal hydrolase, hexosaminidase (Figure 4B), despite comparable levels of total enzyme in controls and siRNA-depleted cells (both 5.2 × 103 units/mg hexosaminidase). In addition, the steady-state levels of MPRs increased at least 2-fold (Figure 4C). These are hallmarks of a block in MPR trafficking (Riederer et al., 1994Riederer M.A. Soldati T. Shapiro A.D. Lin J. Pfeffer S.R. Lysosome biogenesis requires mannose 6-phosphate receptor recycling from endosomes to the trans Golgi network.J.

Espinosa E. Pfeffer S.R. A Syntaxin 10-containing SNARE complex distinguishes two distinct transport routes from endosomes to the trans Golgi network.J. Cell Biol. 2008; 180: 159-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Specifically, when MPRs are mis-sorted to lysosomes they are turned over more rapidly; in several cases, cells compensate for this loss by upregulating MPR synthesis. To confirm a specific role for RhoBTB3 in MPR transport to the Golgi complex, we tested whether anti-RhoBTB3 antibodies could inhibit this transport process in an in vitro system that reconstitutes this transport event (Itin et al., 1999Itin C. Ulitzur N. Pfeffer S.R. Mapmodulin, cytoplasmic dynein and microtubules enhance the transport of mannose 6-phosphate receptors from endosomes to the trans Golgi network.Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 2191-2197Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Anti-RhoBTB3 IgG inhibited transport ∼40% under conditions in which preimmune IgG inhibited less than 10% (Figure 4D). Similarly, negative control anti-Syntaxin 6 antibodies inhibited ∼10% while another positive control antibody, anti-Rab9, also inhibited 40% (Ganley et al., 2008Ganley I.G. Espinosa E. Pfeffer S.R. A Syntaxin 10-containing SNARE complex distinguishes two distinct transport routes from endosomes to the trans Golgi network.J. Cell Biol. 2008; 180: 159-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). These data support the conclusion that RhoBTB3 function is needed for MPR transport to the Golgi complex both in vitro and in live cells. As mentioned earlier, the anti-RhoBTB3 antibody does not readily recognize the native protein upon immunofluorescence of fixed cells, which could easily explain the incomplete block of in vitro transport observed. The specificity of RhoBTB3′s role in retrograde transport was confirmed by monitoring general endocytosis and exocytosis in RhoBTB3-depleted cells. Transferrin uptake and recycling in RhoBTB3-depleted cells was indistinguishable from that seen for control cells (Figure 4E). In addition, in RhoBTB3-depleted cells, the rates of export of VSV-G glycoprotein from the endoplasmic reticulum, its transit through the Golgi complex, and its arrival at the cell surface were entirely unchanged (Figure 4F). In summary, these data show that RhoBTB3 functions specifically in retrograde transport from endosomes to the Golgi complex and in maintenance of the structure of the Golgi complex. Although the Golgi was slightly larger in area (Figure 4A), it was nevertheless fully functional for G-glycoprotein export. We identified two mutant proteins that blocked either RhoBTB3′s nucleotide-binding capacity (N138D, see below) or its ability to interact with Rab9 GTPase (D532E). Thus we could test the importance of these distinct domains on RhoBTB3′s role in MPR transport to the Golgi complex. For these experiments, we used fluorescent siRNA to deplete RhoBTB3 from cells and enable their identification. We then carried out gene rescue experiments with either myc-tagged, wild-type RhoBTB3 or one of three mutant versions, each of which carried eight silent mutations to mask the rescuing construct from siRNA-mediated destruction. In Figure 5 (right column), fluorescent siRNA-containing cells are marked with an asterisk. They are depleted of endogenous RhoBTB3 based upon the high potency of the siRNA (Figure 3D) and the dispersal of MPRs detected. In the top row, RhoBTB3-depleted cells that also received a wild-type rescue plasmid (left column, two cells at left) showed a concentrated, perinuclear MPR distribution. In contrast, the right-most cell that expressed much less of the rescuing protein showed a dispersed MPR phenotype, as expected for RhoBTB3-depleted cells. Thus, the wild-type construct can restore the normal, compact perinuclear MPR distribution. Similar data were obtained for the RhoBTB3 ΔCAAX mutant (Figure 5, bottom row). Again, the presence of the rescue plasmid was sufficient to normalize MPR localization. It is important to note that the CAAX motif may not be modified in cells, which would represent a trivial explanation for its lack of importance for either RhoBTB3 localization or rescue. This was in contrast to cells that were rescued with the RhoBTB3 N138D construct (second row). Loss of RhoBTB3 in the two asterisked cells expanded the Golgi, as monitored by the localization of myc-N138D at left. Despite the presence of the mutant protein in the two lower cells, MPRs remained dispersed. Thus, RhoBTB3′s Rho domain functionality is required for its ability to facilitate MPR recycling to the Golgi. Similarly, the RhoBTB3 D532E rescue plasmid was also unable to correct a dispersed MPR phenotype in most cells analyzed (Figure 5, third row). This suggests that either Rab9 or another interacting partner must be able to link to RhoBTB3 via this site for it to carry out its proper cellular function. Quantitation of these data confirmed that rescue by the wild-type or ΔCAAX RhoBTB3 proteins could restore a normal MPR phenotype to 66%–70% of cells analyzed. In contrast, the D532E mutant was less able to rescue the phenotype (33%) and the N138D mutant was even less functional (17% rescue). Any rescue by the D532E or N138D mutants might be explained by retention of some Rab9-binding capacity and/or high enough expression to permit low basal ATP hydrolysis by RhoBTB3 protein. GTPases contain signature features that reflect the binding and hydrolysis capacities of these enzymes (Sprang, 1997Sprang S.R. G proteins, effectors and GAPs: structure and mechanism.Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1997; 7: 849-856Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). The phosphate binding or P loop and elements G2, G3, and G4 are indicated in Figure 1B. First, note that RhoBTB3 contains an unusual 16 residue insert in the middle of the P loop. P loops often contain multiple glycine residues that are thought to generate flexibility. In RhoBTB3, Pro-Ser-Gly-Leu occupies the middle of the extended loop and is predicted to create a tight, type II β-turn (Ybe and Hecht, 1996Ybe J.A. Hecht M.H. Sequence replacements in the central beta-turn of plastocyanin.Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 814-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). This insert could permit extension of the P loop without disrupting critical contacts with nucleotide. In addition, the canonical K(S/T) residues of the G1/Walker motif consensus sequence are replaced with RS in RhoBTB3, which will maintain charge at that position. A magnesium ion is coordinated by G2 sequences; in RhoBTB3, phenylalanine and glutamic acid replace proline and valine residues conserved between RhoA and RhoBTB2. Theoretically, these changes might still accommodate magnesium binding. RhoBTB3′s G3 residues are also poorly conserved. Most small GTPases contain a glycine residue immediately before the catalytic glutamine in G3; in RhoA, the"

We recently reported that a complex containing the histone H3K79 methyltransferase disruptor of telomeric silencing-1 (Dot1) associates with and represses the alpha-ENaC promoter in mouse inner medullary collecting duct mIMCD3 cells, and that aldosterone acts to disrupt this complex and its inhibitory effects (Zhang, W., Xia, X., Reisenauer, M. R., Rieg, T., Lang, F., Kuhl, D., Vallon, V., and Kone, B. C. (2007) J. Clin. Invest. 117, 773-783). Here we demonstrate that the NAD(+)-dependent deacetylase sirtuin 1 (Sirt1) functionally and physically interacts with Dot1 to enhance the distributive activity of Dot1 on H3K79 methylation and thereby represses alpha-ENaC transcription in mIMCD3 cells. Sirt1 overexpression inhibited basal alpha-ENaC mRNA expression and alpha-ENaC promoter activity, surprisingly in a deacetylase-independent manner. The ability of Sirt1 to inhibit alpha-ENaC transcription was retained in a truncated Sirt1 construct expressing only its N-terminal domain. Conversely, Sirt1 knockdown enhanced alpha-ENaC mRNA levels and alpha-ENaC promoter activity, and inhibited global H3K79 methylation, particularly H3K79 trimethylation, in chromatin associated with the alpha-ENaC promoter. Sirt1 and Dot1 co-immunoprecipitated from mIMCD3 cells and colocalized in the nucleus. Sirt1 immunoprecipitated from chromatin associated with regions of the alpha-ENaC promoter known to associate with Dot1. Aldosterone inhibited Sirt1 association at two of these regions, as well as Sirt1 mRNA expression, in a coordinate manner with induction of alpha-ENaC transcription. Overexpressed Sirt1 inhibited aldosterone induction of alpha-ENaC transcription independent of effects on mineralocorticoid receptor trans-activation. These data identify Sirt1 as a novel modulator of alpha-ENaC, Dot1, and the aldosterone signaling pathway."

Dietary reconstructions inferred from stable isotopes of fossil herbivorous mammalian tooth enamel document environmental and climatic changes in ancient ecosystems, including C3/C4 transitions and relative seasonality. Methodology/Principal Findings Here, we use stable carbon and oxygen isotopes preserved in fossil teeth to document the magnitude of mammalian dietary shifts and ancient floral change during geologically documented glacial and interglacial periods during the Pliocene (∼1.9 million years ago) and Pleistocene (∼1.3 million years ago) in Florida. Stable isotope data demonstrate increased aridity, increased C4 grass consumption, inter-faunal dietary partitioning, increased isotopic niche breadth of mixed feeders, niche partitioning of phylogenetically similar taxa, and differences in relative seasonality with warming. Conclusion/Significance Our data show that global warming resulted in dramatic vegetation and dietary changes even at lower latitudes (∼28°N). Our results also question the use of models that predict the long term decline and extinction of species based on the assumption that niches are conserved over time. These findings have immediate relevance to clarifying possible biotic responses to current global warming in modern ecosystems."

We recently showed that Bj-BPP-10c displays a strong, sustained anti-hypertensive effect in spontaneous hypertensive rats (SHR), without causing any effect in normotensive rats, by a pharmacological effect independent of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition. Therefore, we hypothesized that another mechanism should be involved in the peptide activity. Here we used affinity chromatography to search for kidney cytosolic proteins with affinity for Bj-BPP-10c and demonstrate that argininosuccinate synthetase (AsS) is the major protein binding to the peptide. More importantly, this interaction activates the catalytic activity of AsS in a dose-de pend ent manner. AsS is recognized as an important player of the citrulline-NO cycle that represents a potential limiting step in NO synthesis. Accordingly, the functional interaction of Bj-BPP-10c and AsS was evidenced by the following effects promoted by the peptide: (i) increase of NO metabolite production in human umbilical vein endothelial cell culture and of arginine in human embryonic kidney cells and (ii) increase of arginine plasma concentration in SHR. Moreover, α-methyl-dl-aspartic acid, a specific AsS inhibitor, significantly reduced the anti-hypertensive activity of Bj-BPP-10c in SHR. Taken together, these results suggest that AsS plays a role in the anti-hypertensive action of Bj-BPP-10c. Therefore, we propose the activation of AsS as a new mechanism for the anti-hypertensive effect of Bj-BPP-10c in SHR and AsS as a novel target for the therapy of hypertension-related diseases.

The first available competitive inhibitors of sACE were the naturally occurring proline-rich oligopeptides from the venom of Bothrops jararaca. Clinical studies using Bj-BPP-9a, teprotide, the most efficient of these snake venom peptides, demonstrated the potential of sACE inhibitors as anti-hypertensive drugs (1Gavras H. Brunner H.R. Laragh J.H. Sealey J.E. Gavras I. Vukovich R.A. N. Engl. J. Med. 1974; 291: 817-821Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). Highly potent inhibitors of sACE, which can be administered orally, have subsequently been developed. The first of these, captopril, was designed employing a theoretical model of the active site of sACE, based on its presumed similarity to the active site of carboxypeptidase A and also with reference to the C terminus of venom proline-rich peptides, which compete with sACE substrates (2Ondetti M.A. Rubin B. Cushman D.W. Science. 1977; 196: 441-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (1701) Google Scholar). Since captopril reproduced all known pharmacological effects and sACE-inhibiting features of the proline-rich peptides (3Ng K.K. Vane J.R. Nature. 1970; 225: 1142-1144Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), the interest to deepen the investigation of the biological properties of these naturally occurring sACE inhibitors dropped dramatically. However, we recently showed that the Bj-BPP-10c (<ENWPHPQIPP, where <E represents pyroglutamic acid), the most selective inhibitor of the active site at the C-domain of sACE (4Cotton J. Hayashi M.A. Cuniasse P. Vazeux G. Ianzer D. De Camargo A.C. Dive V. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 6065-6071Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), displays a strong and sustained anti-hypertensive effect in spontaneous hypertensive rats (SHR), independently of the inhibition of sACE (5Ianzer D.

This result led us to hypothesize that, besides sACE, another molecule involved in the arterial blood pressure homeostasis could possibly be a target for Bj-BPP-10c. Two reasons prompted us to search the putative target in the kidney: (i) the crucial role played by the kidney in the arterial blood pressure control (6Ram C.V. Curr. Hypertens.

In the present study, we identified the kidney argininosuccinate synthetase (AsS) as a putative target for Bj-BPP10c, and we show results demonstrating that the anti-hypertensive effect of this peptide in SHR is related to the activation of the arginine production in the kidney and of the citrulline-NO cycle in endothelial cells. Experiments were performed using BALB/c mice (25–30 g), male guinea pigs (150–250 g), male Wistar rats (230–300 g), and SHR (230–300 g), which were bred at the animal care facility of Instituto Butantan (São Paulo, Brazil) and in the Instituto de Ciências Biomédicas (Universidade de São Paulo, São Paulo, Brazil). All animals were caged and handled under ethical conditions according to international rules of animals care, stated by the International Animal Welfare Recommendations, and in accordance with the Guidelines for the Use of Animals in Biochemical Research (8Giles A.R. Thromb. Haemost. 1987; 58: 1078-1084Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). Human embryonic kidney cells (HEK 293) (ATCC number CRL 1573) were propagated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 2 mml-glutamine, 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, and 100 mg/ml penicillin/streptomycin and were kept at 37 °C, 5% CO2, in a humidified incubator. Cells were treated with a 0.5% trypsin solution and replicated when an adequate cell concentration had been reached. The medium was exchanged after 12 h and later every third day. Human umbilical vessel endothelial cells (HUVECs) were obtained from umbilical vessels donated by the Hospital of the University of São Paulo. Vessels were washed externally with 96% ethanol, and after a diagonal cut at the end of the vessel, a catheter was introduced into the vessel vein and attached to a three-way valve. The vein was washed with 20 ml of sterile saline, and the other end of the vessel was tied before injecting 1 ml of type IV collagenase solution (0.2 mg/ml/cm of umbilical vessel). The vessel was transferred to a Petri dish and incubated for 15 min at 37 °C. Cells of the internal side of the cord were removed by massage and transferred to a sterile tube. Bovine fetal serum was added to a final concentration of 10%, the suspension was centrifuged for 10 min at 3,000 × g at 4 °C, and the cell pellet was resuspended in 2 ml of complete medium (40% Medium 199, 40% Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 18% bovine fetal serum, 1% l-glutamine, 1% penicillin/streptomycin). The cell suspension was transferred to a bottle previously treated with a 1% gelatin solution (30 min at 4 °C), and 5 ml of complete medium was added. The bottle was incubated at 37 °C, 5% CO2, in a humidified incubator, and the medium was exchanged after 12 h and later every third day. Bj-BPP-10c was synthesized using an automatic synthesizer PSSM8 (Shimadzu Co.) by the solid phase peptide synthesis Fmoc (N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl) strategy (9Atherton E. Sheppard R.C. Solid Phase Peptide Synthesis-A Practical Approach. ILR Press, Oxford1989Google Scholar). The synthetic peptide was purified by preparative reversed-phase chromatography (reversed-phase HPLC), and the purity and identity of the peptide were confirmed by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry on an Ettan MALDI-TOF/Pro instrument (Amersham Biosciences) and by analytical reversed-phase HPLC in two different solvent systems. Bj-BPP-10c-Cy3 was prepared by the covalent conjugation of Bj-BPP-10c, synthesized with a free N-terminal amino group (ENWPHPQIPP), to the fluorescent dye cyanine 3 (Cy3) using the fluorolink Cy3-reactive dye (GE Healthcare) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Bj-BPP-10c-Cy3 was purified by reversed-phase HPLC and analyzed by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry as described above. For preparation of a Bj-BPP-10c affinity column, a HiTrap NHS-activated HP column (GE Healthcare) was washed three times with 2 ml of 1 mm HCl before Bj-BPP-10c (5 mg in 1 ml of 0.2 m NaHCO3, 0.5 m NaCl, pH 8.3) was added. After 30 min of incubation at room temperature, the column with the coupled peptide was inactivated with buffer A (0.5 m ethanolamine, 0.5 m NaCl, pH 8.3) and washed three times with 5 volumes of 0.2 m NaHCO3, 0.5 m NaCl, pH 8.3, and stored at 4 °C in 50 mm Na2HPO4, 0.1%, NaN3, pH 7.0. This column was named HiTrap-Bj-BPP-10c, and a control column was prepared by incubating the HiTrap NHS-activated HP column with buffer A (HiTrap-control). BALB/c mice were anesthetized with 0.05 ml of 10% ketamine and 2% xylazine (1:1) and submitted to intracardiac perfusion (from the left ventricle and through the right atrium) with 20 ml of 0.15 m NaCl and 0.01% sodium heparin at a flow rate of 4 ml/min. The kidneys were immediately removed and weighed, and a solution containing 10 mm Tris-HCl, 25 mm saccharose, 1 mm EDTA, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, pH 7.5 (1 ml/g), was added. Kidneys were minced with scissors, and the tissue was homogenized (Polytron PT MR 3000; Kinematic AG), and centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 35 min at 4 °C. The supernatant containing the cytosolic proteins was stored at −20 °C until use. The HiTrap-Bj-BPP-10c column was equilibrated with 2 ml of 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.0. The mouse kidney cytosolic fraction (100 mg/ml protein) was applied to the column at a flow rate of 1 ml/min, and the column was washed with 10 ml of 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0. Proteins that bound to Bj-BPP-10c were eluted with 2 ml of 100 mm glycine, 0.5 m NaCl buffer, pH 3.0, or alternatively by competition with 2 ml of 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, containing 5 mg/ml Bj-BPP-10c. The eluted material was dialyzed in 10 mm NH4HCO3, pH 8.0, for 12 h at 4 °C and concentrated to 0.1 ml final volume using a SpeedVac concentrator. Protein concentrations were determined by the Bio-Rad protein assay kit using bovine serum albumin as a standard. Samples were analyzed by electrophoresis on 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gels, as described by Laemmli (10Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205531) Google Scholar). Following electrophoresis, proteins were electrotransferred to a nitrocellulose membrane, and immunostaining was performed according to Burnette (11Burnette W.N. Anal. Biochem. 1981; 112: 195-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (5847) Google Scholar), using as primary antibody a 1:500 dilution of anti-AsS antibody (BD Transduction Laboratories) and as second antibody a 1:7500 dilution of anti-mouse IgG conjugated to alkaline phosphatase (Promega). Blots were developed using AP buffer (5 m NaCl, 1 m Tris-HCl, pH 9.5, 1 m MgCl2) with 115 mm 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate and 60 mm nitro blue tetrazolium as substrate. For protein identification, protein bands were excised, destained, and digested in-gel with trypsin (12Hanna S.L. Sherman N.E. Kinter M.T. Goldberg J.B. Microbiology. 2000; 146: 2495-2508Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). The tryptic peptide mixture was lyophilized, dissolved in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, submitted to ZipTip C18 (Millipore Corp.), and spotted onto the sample plate of an Ettan MALDI-TOF/Pro mass spectrometer (GE Healthcare), mixed with the same volume of a saturated solution of α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid (Sigma) in 50% acetonitrile, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, and analyzed using P14R ((M + H)+ = 1,533.8582) and angiotensin II ((M + H)+ 1,046.5423) (Sigma) as external calibrants. AsS activity was determined based on accumulation of the product pyrophosphate as inorganic phosphate, following cleavage with pyrophosphatase. AsS (1 μg) was added to the reaction buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 2 mm ATP, 2 mm citrulline, 2 mm aspartate, 6 mm MgCl2, 20 mm KCl, and 0.2 units of pyrophosphatase) to a final volume of 0.2 ml. Samples were incubated at 37 °C in 96-well microtiter plates, and the reactions were stopped after 30 min by the addition of an equal volume of molybdate buffer (10 mm ascorbic acid, 2.5 mm ammonium molybdate, 2% sulfuric acid). Accumulation of phosphate was determined spectrophotometrically at 650 nm, and concentration was extrapolated from a standard curve of inorganic phosphate. HEK 293 cells or HUVECs were seeded on coverslips, allowed to settle, and serum-starved overnight. Cell monolayers were treated with 1 μm Bj-BPP-10c-Cy3 at 37 °C for 30 min dissolved in serum-free medium. After treatment, cell monolayers were washed three times with PBS, fixed with 4% formaldehyde for 15 min, and washed with sterile water. Cells were then incubated with anti-fading reagent (Vector Laboratories) and visualized using a fluorescence microscope (Axiocam; Zeiss) and Cy3 filter sets (excitation 550 nm, emission 570 nm). Photomultiplier gain and laser power were kept constant throughout each experiment. 1 × 106 HUVECs and HEK 293 cells were seeded into 6-well culture plates in appropriate medium and incubated at 37 °C, 5% CO2, in a humidified incubator for 24 h. Cells were then incubated in serum-free medium with 500 pmol of Bj-BPP-10c for 0.5, 1, 2, 3, and 4 h. After discarding the culture medium, cells were washed and lysed with 0.1 ml of PBS by freezing and thawing and centrifuged at 21,000 × g at 4 °C for 15 min. Supernatants were collected and kept at −80 °C (intracellular medium) until use. Liquid chromatography electrospray ionization mass spectrometric analyses were carried out on a liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry Surveyor MSQ Plus (Thermo Electron) in the positive mode. Samples (0.02 ml) were injected into an analytic column (source 5RPC ST 2.1/150; Amersham Biosciences) and eluted using a gradient of 20–100% B (B = 90% acetonitrile, 0.1% formic acid; A = 0.1% formic acid) in 20 min, at a flow rate of 0.2 ml/min. The capillary and cone potential were set to 3.1 kV and 40 V, respectively. Bj-BPP-10c was detected as a double-charged ion by selected ion monitoring of the 599 m/z (M + 2H)2+, span 1 atomic mass unit, and dwell time 1 s. A standard calibration curve for the analyte was constructed by plotting the peak area against the amount of Bj-BPP-10c standard (5–1,000 pmol) spiked into 0.1 ml of cell lysates. The data were processed using Xcalibur version 1.4 software (Thermo Electron), and unknown sample peak areas were then interpolated from the calibration curve to provide concentrations of Bj-BPP-10c. Cell viability was tested using the Live/Dead kit (Invitrogen), which uses two fluorescent dyes, calcein AM and EthD-1 (ethidium homodimer), to stain live and dead cells simultaneously. 1 × 106 cells (HEK 293 and HUVEC) were cultured in serum-free medium in the presence or in the absence of 100 μm Bj-BPP-10c for 24 h at 37 °C in 96-well black-walled fluorescence plates (Costar). After this period, the medium was removed, and the cells were incubated with calcein AM (4 μm) and EthD-1 (2 μm) for 30 min at room temperature, and the fluorescence of green calcein (excitation 485 nm, emission 530 nm) or red EthD-1 (excitation 530 nm, emission 645 nm) was measured using the FlexStation 3 reader (Molecular Devices). Relative numbers of live and dead cells were calculated from the number of non-treated live cells and the number of dead cells (treated with 0.1–0.5% digitonin for 10 min) using the software SoftMax®Pro (Molecular Devices). 1 × 106 cells were cultured in serum-free medium containing 0.01–100 μm Bj-BPP-10c and/or 1 mm MDLA (Sigma) for 24 h at 37 °C. The culture medium was collected (extracellular medium), and the cells were washed five times with Krebs solution (118 mm NaCl, 4.7 mm KCl, 1.2 mm KH2PO4, 1.17 mm MgSO4, 2.5 mm CaCl2, 25 mm NaHCO3, 5.6 mm glucose), resuspended with 0.1 ml of Krebs solution, and proteins were extracted with 0.5 ml of methanol. The mixture was centrifuged for 2 min at 10,000 × g to remove cell debris, and 0.2 ml of the supernatant (intracellular medium) was mixed with 0.8 ml of PBS. Oasis MCX SPE columns (Waters) were used without preconditioning, and all washing and elution steps were performed by vacuum suction. After sample application, the columns were consecutively washed with 1 ml of 100 mm HCl and 1 ml of methanol. Bound analytes were eluted with 1 ml of ammonia/water/methanol (10/40/50) and dried in a SpeedVac concentrator at 70 °C. The dried material was derivatized with phenylisothiocyanate for arginine determination, as previously described (13Heinrikson R.L. Meredith S.C. Anal. Biochem. 1984; 136: 65-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (1347) Google Scholar, 14Ebert R.F. Anal. Biochem. 1986; 154: 431-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Briefly, the dried samples were directly derivatized with 0.03 ml of phenylisothiocyanate reagent (75% ethanol/water (7:1), 12.5% triethylamine, 12.5% phenylisothiocyanate). After vigorous mixing, the mixture was incubated for 10 min at room temperature, 0.17 ml of water was added, and 0.1 ml of the final mixture was injected into a C18 analytical column (250 mm, 4.6 mm, 5 μm; Merck) coupled to an HPLC apparatus (HP 1100 series). Elution was performed using a gradient of acetonitrile as described before (14Ebert R.F. Anal. Biochem. 1986; 154: 431-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). A standard chromatographic run of arginine was performed by injecting a 0.1 ml of a standard solution prepared as follows. 0.03 ml of a 2.5 mm arginine solution was mixed with 0.03 ml of the phenylisothiocyanate reagent, the mixture was incubated for 10 min at room temperature, and the volume was adjusted to 0.2 ml with water. A control chromatographic run was performed using 0.1 ml of phenylisothiocyanate reagent. The integrated peak areas were compared with that of the arginine standard to calculate the amount of arginine present in each sample. Bj-BPP-10c (71 nmol/kg) or MDLA (Sigma; 1 mmol/kg) was administered to SHR (n = 6) and to Wistar rats (n = 3) by intravenous bolus injection (0.5 ml). Blood was obtained by venipuncture and collected in Vacutainer tubes (BD Biosciences) containing heparin as anticoagulant. After centrifugation at 3,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, plasma samples (0.2 ml) were mixed with 0.2 ml of PBS and submitted to chromatography on Oasis MCX SPE columns (15Teerlink T. Nijveldt R.J. de Jong S. van Leeuwen P.A. Anal. Biochem. 2002; 303: 131-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar) and determination of plasmatic arginine levels by HPLC/fluorescence detection analysis as described above. Determination of NOx (nitrate and nitrite) was performed with a chemiluminescence nitric oxide analyzer (NOA280; Sievers Instruments), following the procedure optimized by Feelisch et al. (16Feelisch M. Rassaf T. Mnaimneh S. Singh N. Bryan N.S. Jourd'Heuil D. Kelm M. FASEB J. 2002; 16: 1775-1785Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). Bj-BPP-10c was added in the concentration range of 0.01–100 μm to HUVECs grown in Petri dishes (1 × 106 cells), and incubation continued for 24 h in serum-free medium. Subsequently, 1 ml of medium was retrieved (extracellular medium) and treated with a concentrated solution of N-ethylmaleimide to give a final concentration of 10 mm. Cells were washed with PBS and lysed in radioimmune precipitation buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet p-40, 0.5% sodium desoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 1 mm DTPA, and 10 mm N-ethylmaleimide). Cell lysates were collected and incubated on ice for 30 min and centrifuged at 21,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. The supernatant (intracellular medium) and extracellular medium were directly injected into a vessel containing a saturated solution of vanadium(III) chloride in 1 n HCl maintained at 90 °C. Under these conditions, all nitric oxide-derived products (nitrate, nitrite, nitrosothiol, nitrosamines, and iron-nitrosyl complexes) were reduced to and compared with those of standard solutions of nitrate under the same experimental conditions (16Feelisch M. Rassaf T. Mnaimneh S. Singh N. Bryan N.S. Jourd'Heuil D. Kelm M. FASEB J. 2002; 16: 1775-1785Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar, 17Linares E. Giorgio S. Augusto O. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2008; 44: 1668-1676Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). HEK 293 and HUVEC cell lines (1 × 106 cells) were treated with Bj-BPP-10c (0.5 μm) for 24 h in serum-free medium. Cell lysates were prepared by adding 1 ml of lysing buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm EDTA), and lysates were centrifuged at 12,000 × g at 4 °C for 10 min. Equal amounts of supernatant protein were incubated with Dynabeads protein G (Invitrogen) at 4 °C for 1 h for preclearing. Supernatants were then incubated with anti-phosphoserine/phosphothreonine antibody (BD Biosciences) at 4 °C for 4 h. The antibody-antigen complex was incubated with Dynabeads protein G for 1 h at 4 °C. After washing the beads three times with PBS, immunoprecipitated proteins were eluted by boiling the beads in a solution containing 62.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 25% glycerol, 2% SDS, and 0.01% bromphenol blue and quantified by the Bio-Rad protein assay kit using bovine serum albumin as a standard. For immunoblots, equal amounts of protein (1 μg) were separated on SDS-polyacrylamide gels, transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes, and immunostained with anti-AsS (BD Transduction Laboratories) or anti-glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (Novus Biologicals) antibodies according to Ref. 11Burnette W.N. Anal. Biochem. 1981; 112: 195-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (5847) Google Scholar. Anti-glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase was used as a loading control. 20 h before the experiment, under anesthesia with 23.5% tribromoethanol (1 ml/100 g body weight) intraperitoneally, a polyethylene catheter (PE-10 connected to PE-50) was introduced into abdominal aorta through a femoral artery for measurements of mean arterial pressure (MAP) and into a femoral vein for intravenous injection. After recovery from anesthesia, the rats were kept in individual cages with free access to water and chow until the end of the experiments. Before drug administration, the MAP was monitored for 1 h (base-line period). After this period, intravenous bolus injection of Bj-BPP-10c, MDLA, or 0.15 m NaCl in a total volume of 0.5 ml was carried out. Bj-BPP-10c (71 nmol/kg) or MDLA (1 mmol/kg) was administered to SHR (n = 6) and in Wistar rats (n = 4). MAP values were registered at 2-min intervals for the entire recording period (6 h). Bradykinin potentiation assays on isolated guinea pig ileum were performed essentially as described previously (18Gomes C.L. Konno K. Conceição I.M. Ianzer D. Yamanouye N. Prezoto B.C. Assakura M.T. Rádis-Baptista G. Yamane T. Santos R.A. de Camargo A.C. Hayashi M.A. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2007; 74: 1350-1360Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Male guinea pigs (150–250 g body weight) were fasted for 24 h before experiments. Segments of about 15 cm of the terminal ileum were removed and cleaned from surrounding tissues, and the lumens were carefully washed with Tyrode solution (137 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 1.36 mm CaCl2, 0.49 mm MgCl2, 0.36 mm NaH2PO4, 11.9 mm NaHCO3, 5.04 mmd-glucose), containing diphenyldramine (1 mg/ml) and atropine (1 mg/ml). After a resting period of 30 min, segments of 4.5 cm of the isolated ileum were mounted in a 5-ml chamber containing continuously aerated Tyrode solution at 37 °C. Isometric contractions were recorded by means of isometric transducers coupled to a recording system (Powerlab/4SP; AD Instruments), under a load of 1.0 g. Concentration-response curves for bradykinin were obtained in the absence (control) or presence of 3 × 10−6m pure peptide. Dose-response curves were fitted through a non-linear regression, and pD2 values (−logEC50) were calculated using the curve-fitting program Graphpad Prism 5.0 (GraphPad Software). Data were expressed as mean ± S.E. All data are presented as mean ± S.E. Student's t test was used to determine statistical differences. A p value of less than 0.01 was considered significant. Following our hypothesis that Bj-BPP-10c might have another target protein besides sACE and our previous work showing the long lasting permanence of 125I-Bj-BPP-10c in the mouse kidney when the peptide was administered concomitantly with a saturating concentration of captopril (7Silva C.A. Portaro F.C. Fernandes B.L. Ianzer D.A. Guerreiro J.R. Gomes C.L. Konno K. Serrano S.M. Nascimento N. Camargo A.C. Toxicon. 2008; 51: 515-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), we submitted a mouse kidney cytosol preparation to affinity chromatography using the HiTrap NHS-activated HP resin to which Bj-BPP-10c was immobilized by chemical conjugation. As shown in Fig. 1A, a major protein bound to the resin and was eluted with 100 mm glycine, 0.5 m NaCl, pH 3.0 (elution buffer). The same protein profile was obtained when the bound fraction was eluted by competition with 5 mm Bj-BPP-10c. Confirming the specificity of binding to Bj-BPP-10c, a similar elution profile was obtained when the cytosolic proteins were prechromatographed on a HiTrap-control column followed by chromatography on the HiTrap-Bj-BPP-10c column and eluted with elution buffer. The 46-kDa major protein that bound to Bj-BPP-10c was identified by trypsin digestion and peptide mass fingerprint as AsS (EC 6.3.4.5), an enzyme that catalyzes the synthesis of argininosuccinate from citrulline and aspartate (Fig. 1B and supplemental) Table 1. An anti-AsS antibody also recognized the 46-kDa protein in an immunoblot assay (Fig. 1C). In hepatocytes, in kidney proximal tubules, and in NO-producing cells, AsS catalyzes the conversion of citrulline, l-aspartate, and ATP to argininosuccinate, AMP, and pyrophosphate (19Hu"
https://openalex.org/W2058276214,"Mitochondrial biosynthesis of iron-sulfur clusters (ISCs) is a vital process involving the delivery of elemental iron and sulfur to a scaffold protein via molecular interactions that are still poorly defined. Analysis of highly conserved components of the yeast ISC assembly machinery shows that the iron-chaperone, Yfh1, and the sulfur-donor complex, Nfs1-Isd11, directly bind to each other. This interaction is mediated by direct Yfh1-Isd11 contacts. Moreover, both Yfh1 and Nfs1-Isd11 can directly bind to the scaffold, Isu1. Binding of Yfh1 to Nfs1-Isd11 or Isu1 requires oligomerization of Yfh1 and can occur in an iron-independent manner. However, more stable contacts are formed when Yfh1 oligomerization is normally coupled with the binding and oxidation of Fe2+. Our observations challenge the view that iron delivery for ISC synthesis is mediated by Fe2+-loaded monomeric Yfh1. Rather, we find that the iron oxidation-driven oligomerization of Yfh1 promotes the assembly of stable multicomponent complexes in which the iron donor and the sulfur donor simultaneously interact with each other as well as with the scaffold. Moreover, the ability to store ferric iron enables oligomeric Yfh1 to adjust iron release depending on the presence of Isu1 and the availability of elemental sulfur and reducing equivalents. In contrast, the use of anaerobic conditions that prevent Yfh1 oligomerization results in inhibition of ISC assembly on Isu1. These findings suggest that iron-dependent oligomerization is a mechanism by which the iron donor promotes assembly of the core machinery for mitochondrial ISC synthesis.

ISC 3The abbreviations used are: ISCiron-sulfur clusterNi-NTAnickel-nitrilotriacetic acid. biosynthesis is an essential function that eukaryotic cells initiate in mitochondria and probably other cellular compartments using three core components: a sulfur donor, an iron donor, and an ISC assembly scaffold (1Lill R.

Chem. 2006; 281: 12344-12351Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). In yeast mitochondria, the cysteine-desulfurase, Nfs1, and the iron-chaperone, Yfh1, are believed to provide sulfur and iron, respectively, for ISC assembly on the Isu1 scaffold (1Lill R. Mühlenhoff U. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2008; 77: 669-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (495) Google Scholar), whereas the Nfs1-binding protein, Isd11, has been shown to stabilize Nfs1 (3Adam A.C. Bornhövd C. Prokisch H. Neupert W. Hell K. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 174-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). These components are highly conserved and the human orthologues of Yfh1 (frataxin), Isu1 (ISCU), and Isd11 (ISD11) are implicated in the etiology of severe disorders including Friedreich ataxia and mitochondrial myopathy (4Rouault T.A. Tong W.H. Trends Genet. 2008; 24: 398-407Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). iron-sulfur cluster nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid. Previous studies have underscored the complexity of the interactions among eukaryotic ISC assembly components as well as their metal dependence. Supplementation of mitochondrial lysates with Fe2+ under aerobic conditions led to co-isolation of Yfh1 and Isu1 along with Nfs1 and Isd11 by pulldown or immunoprecipitation assays (5Wang T. Craig E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 12674-12679Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 6Foury F. Pastore A. Trincal M.

Furthermore, aerobic preincubation of histidine-tagged Yfh1 monomer with Fe2+ enabled Isu1 to be pulled down by Yfh1 in the absence of other proteins (5Wang T. Craig E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 12674-12679Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). These studies have led to the current view that iron delivery for yeast ISC synthesis involves direct contacts between iron-loaded monomeric Yfh1 and Isu1 (5Wang T. Craig E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 12674-12679Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 6Foury F. Pastore A. Trincal M.

Although Yfh1 oligomerization is normally coupled with iron binding, oxidation, and storage (5Wang T. Craig E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 12674-12679Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 8Park S. Gakh O. Mooney S.M. Isaya G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 38589-38595Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), the possibility that Isu1 might also interact with oligomeric Yfh1 has remained largely unexplored. Similar to Yfh1, human frataxin was found to interact with multiple ISC assembly components in human cells; however, in this case immunoprecipitation data suggested that frataxin binds to ISCU indirectly, via nickel-dependent contacts with ISD11 (9Shan Y. Napoli E. Cortopassi G. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2007; 16: 929-941Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Whether direct interactions occur between Yfh1 and Isd11 has not yet been examined. While previous studies focused primarily on Yfh1-Isu1 and frataxin-ISD11 interactions, it is likely that the coordinate delivery of potentially toxic sulfur and iron to Isu1/ISCU involves multiple close interactions whereby the sulfur donor and the iron donor simultaneously interact with each other and with the ISC scaffold, as proposed for prokaryotic ISC assembly (10Layer G. Ollagnier-de Choudens S. Sanakis Y. Fontecave M. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 16256-16263Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). However, it is currently unknown whether monomeric Yfh1/frataxin may form direct contacts with more than one partner, and the structure of the eukaryotic ISC assembly machinery is completely undefined. We show that iron oxidation-dependent oligomerization enables Yfh1 to have simultaneous direct interactions with Nfs1-Isd11 and Isu1. Our data provide insights about the sequence of events and the molecular architecture required for the initial step in mitochondrial ISC assembly. Yfh1 monomer, trimer, and 24-mer were expressed in Escherichia coli and purified as described (11Karlberg T. Schagerlöf U. Gakh O. Park S. Ryde U. Lindahl M. Leath K. Garman E. Isaya G. Al-Karadaghi S. Structure. 2006; 14: 1535-1546Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). For expression of Isu1His, a DNA fragment corresponding to the predicted mature form of Isu1 (residues 28–166) (12Gerber J. Neumann K. Prohl C. Mühlenhoff U. Lill R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 4848-4857Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar) was cloned in vector pET28b (Novagen) in two steps: first, the fragment was cloned into the EcoRI and HindIII sites of pET28b, and second, an NcoI-EcoRI fragment was removed. This resulted in the addition of seven amino acids plus a six-histidine tag to the Isu1 C terminus. Isu1His was expressed in E. coli strain BL21 and purified by nickel affinity chromatography (5-ml HiTrap Ni-column, Amersham Biosciences) followed by preparative gel-filtration chromatography (16-mm × 50-cm column packed with Superdex 75 support from Amersham Biosciences) essentially as described for Haemophilus influenzae IscU (13Ramelot T.A. Cort J.R. Goldsmith-Fischman S. Kornhaber G.J. Xiao R. Shastry R. Acton T.B. Honig B. Montelione G.T. Kennedy M.A. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 344: 567-583Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were grown at 25 °C in 1 liter of Luria broth containing 30 μg/ml kanamycin. Protein expression was induced at A600 = 0.6 with 0.5 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside, and growth continued at 15 °C for ∼18 h. Cells were harvested and disrupted by sonication in 50 mm NaH2PO4, pH 8.0, 300 mm NaCl, 10 mm imidazole, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, containing 1 tablet/50 ml of buffer of complete protease inhibitor mixture EDTA-free (Roche Diagnostics). Isu1His was eluted from the HiTrap Ni-column in 50 mm NaH2PO4, pH 8.0, 300 mm NaCl, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, between 160 and 240 mm imidazole. Gel-filtration chromatography was carried out in 10 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.8, 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol. Isu1His was stable in 10 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.8, 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol at a protein concentration ≤2.0 mg/ml. For production of untagged Isu1, a DNA fragment corresponding to residues 28–166 was cloned in the NdeI and XhoI sites of pET28b, which resulted in the addition of an N-terminal 6-histidine tag followed by a thrombin cleavage site. Protein was expressed as described above, and after nickel affinity chromatography, the histidine tag was removed by incubation with thrombin (Sigma, 0.1 mg of thrombin per 100 mg of His-Isu1) for ∼12 h at 4 °C. Uncleaved His-Isu1 was removed by nickel affinity chromatography, and fractions corresponding to untagged Isu1 were purified by Superdex 75 gel-filtration chromatography as described above. Two DNA fragments corresponding to residues 36–498 of Nfs1 and 12–95 of Isd11—the predicted mature forms of these proteins as determined with MitoProtII (14Claros M.G. Vincens P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 241: 779-786Crossref PubMed Scopus (1386) Google Scholar)—were cloned into the NdeI and XhoI, and NcoI and HindIII sites, respectively, of vector pCDFDuet (Novagen), which resulted in the addition of a C-terminal S-tag to Nfs1 and an N-terminal 6-histidine tag to Isd11. A thrombin cleavage site was also introduced immediately after the 6-histidine tag on Isd11. Nfs1 and Isd11 were co-expressed in E. coli essentially as described for the human orthologs (15Marelja Z. Stöcklein W. Nimtz M. Leimkühler S. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 25178-25185Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Briefly, BL21 cells were grown at 25 °C in 1 liter of Luria broth containing 30 μg/ml streptomycin. Protein expression was induced at A600 = 0.6 with 0.5 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside. Growth was continued for ∼18 h at 15 °C, after which cells were harvested, resuspended in lysis buffer (50 mm NaH2PO4, pH 8.0, 300 mm NaCl, 20 mm imidazole, containing 50 μm pyridoxal phosphate, 10% glycerol, and 1 tablet/50 ml of buffer of complete protease inhibitor mixture EDTA-free), and disrupted by sonication. The lysate was centrifuged at 25,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C, and the soluble fraction was loaded onto a 5-ml HiTrap nickel column. The Nfs1-Isd11His complex was eluted in lysis buffer without protease inhibitors between 150 and 250 mm imidazole and was further purified by preparative gel-filtration chromatography (16-mm × 50-cm column packed with Superdex 200 support from Amersham Biosciences) in 10 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.8, 150 mm NaCl, 50 μm pyridoxal phosphate. The Nfs1-Isd11 His complex was stable in this buffer at a protein concentration of ≤5 mg/ml. A DNA fragment corresponding to the predicted mature form of Isd11 was cloned in the NdeI and HindIII sites of pET28b resulting in the addition of an N-terminal 6-histidine tag followed by a thrombin cleavage site as described above. For expression of Isd11His we used the same procedure employed for co-expression of Nfs1-Isd11His, except that induction with isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside was for 2 h at 37 °C, because this resulted in a higher protein yield relative to other conditions tested. Isd11His was expressed at very low levels and exhibited a strong tendency to precipitate out of solution. Therefore, upon HiTrap nickel-affinity chromatography, fractions containing mostly Isd11His monomer were pooled and concentrated to ∼0.4 mg of protein/ml in 10 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.8, 150 mm NaCl. As determined by SDS-PAGE, Yfh1, Isu1His, untagged Isu1, and the Nfs1-Isd11His complex exhibited >90% purity, whereas isolated Isd11His exhibited >80% purity (supplemental Fig. S1). Protein concentration was determined by use of the BCA kit (Pierce) and is expressed in all cases per subunit. Iron content of purified proteins was measured as described (8Park S. Gakh O. Mooney S.M. Isaya G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 38589-38595Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid (Ni-NTA)-agarose (Qiagen) affinity pulldown experiments were started by incubating increasing concentrations of the appropriate His-tagged protein (Isu1His or Nfs1-Isd11His) with a fixed concentration (typically 4 μm) of each partner protein (Yfh1 and/or Isu1). Unless otherwise stated, binding was allowed to occur at 30 °C for 30 min in 100 μl of binding buffer (10 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.3, 100 mm NaCl, 20 mm imidazole, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol). Stock solutions of ferrous ammonium sulfate (4–10 mm, pH ∼ 4) were freshly prepared in water previously deaerated by purging with argon gas (<0.2 ppm O2). To generate holo-Yfh1 proteins, each apoform (typically 40 μm) was aerobically incubated with 10 equivalents of Fe(NH4)2(SO4)2 for ∼15 h in 10 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.3, at room temperature on a nutator mixer, and added to the binding reaction to achieve the appropriate final concentration. The Fe2+/subunit molar ratio used to generate holo-Yfh1 proteins was lower than the maximum loading capacities of both Yfh1 and Yfh1-Y73A (>50 and ∼50 atoms of iron/subunit) (16Nichol H.

Chem. 2008; 283: 31500-31510Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). In addition, iron loading was carried out under established aerobic conditions that lead to formation of a stable ferric iron mineral inside Yfh1 or Yfh1-Y73A oligomers (16Nichol H. Gakh O. o舗Neill H.A. Pickering I.J. Isaya G. George G.N. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 5971-5976Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 18Schagerlöf U. Elmlund H. Gakh O. Nordlund G. Hebert H.

Accordingly, ultrafiltration analysis of holo-Yfh1 forms in Ultrafree-0.5 devices (Millipore) (8Park S. Gakh O. Mooney S.M. Isaya G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 38589-38595Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 19Park S. Gakh O. o舗Neill H.A. Mangravita A. Nichol H. Ferreira G.C. Isaya G. J. Biol.

With holoproteins subjected to ultrafiltration, the absolute amounts of all three Yfh1 forms pulled down by Isu1His were not significantly different as compared with untreated holoforms (see Fig. 1D), and therefore ultrafiltration was omitted from subsequent experiments using holo-Yfh1 forms. Beads were washed and equilibrated with one volume of binding buffer containing 0.01% bovine serum albumin. Equilibrated beads (20 μl of a slurry containing equal volumes of beads and buffer) were added to each binding reaction and washed four times with 1 ml of binding buffer containing 0.1% Triton X-100. Bound proteins were eluted by boiling the beads for 5 min in Laemmli buffer and resolved by SDS-PAGE on Criterion precast Tris-HCl gel (Bio-Rad). The flow-through of each binding reaction was also analyzed on a separate gel as a control. This demonstrated that essentially 100% of the Isu1His or Nfs1-Isd11His added to the reactions was bound to the Ni-NTA beads. Gels were stained with SYPRO Orange (Invitrogen), and bound protein was quantified relative to the internal standard using ImageQuant 5.0 on a Storm 860 (Amersham Biosciences). Unless otherwise stated, samples (typically 250 μl) containing one or more of the proteins under investigation (typically 40 μm each protein) were incubated in binding buffer for 30 min at 30 °C. The binding reaction was centrifuged for 5 min at 20,000 × g and loaded onto the appropriate column equilibrated with the same buffer. Fractions were collected, and aliquots were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and SYPRO Orange staining. To generate holo-Yfh1 proteins, each apoform (typically 80 μm) was aerobically incubated with 10 equivalents of Fe(NH4)2(SO4)2 as described above and added to the binding reaction to achieve the required final concentration. Apo-α or apo-α24Y73A was aerobically incubated with Fe(NH4)2(SO4)2 at a Fe2+/subunit ratio of 1:2 for 75 min in 20 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.3, 150 mm NaCl (19Park S. Gakh O. o舗Neill H.A. Mangravita A.

To verify the extent of iron oxidation, each holo-Yfh1 form was centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 10 min to eliminate insoluble iron, and the supernatant incubated with the Fe2+ chelator, α-α′-bipyridine (8Park S.

All buffers and solutions were purged with argon gas (<0.2 ppm O2) in vials tightly sealed with rubber septa. Each reaction was assembled in a quartz cuvette that was purged with nitrogen gas before and after addition of each component, and finally sealed with a tight fitting rubber septum. [2Fe-2S] synthesis was started with addition of 50 μm iron (80 μl), provided as holo-α or holo-α24Y73A or directly, to anaerobic reactions containing 6.25 μm Isu1His, 2.5 mm Na2S, 5 mm dithiothreitol, and 2 mml-cysteine in 20 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.3, 150 mm NaCl (800-μl final reaction volume). Reactions containing 0.5–1.0 μm Nfs1-Isd11His instead of Na2S were set up in a similar manner. Reactions containing holo-α(Fe2+) were similarly set up except that apo-α was incubated with Fe(NH4)2(SO4)2 anaerobically (8Park S. Gakh O. Mooney S.M. Isaya G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 38589-38595Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). ISC synthesis was monitored spectrophotometrically at A426. Strains expressing wild-type and mutant Yfh1 proteins were described previously (17Gakh O. Smith 4th, D.Y. Isaya G. J. Biol.

Genet. 2006; 15: 467-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). In all cases, cells were incubated at 30 °C in YPGal medium (1% yeast extract, 2% peptone, 2% galactose, 0.5% glucose). Cell growth and mitochondria isolation were performed as described (17Gakh O. Smith 4th, D.Y. Isaya G. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 31500-31510Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Mitochondria (800 μl at ∼12 mg of total protein/ml) were suspended in 10 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.3, 100 mm NaCl, and disrupted by sonication, followed by treatment with 0.5% Triton X-100 for 30 min on ice. The mitochondrial lysate was cleared by centrifugation at 20,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant (∼4.5 mg of total protein) was used for the experiment. Pulldown assays were performed with Ni-NTA-agarose beads (40 μl slurry) with or without bound Isu1His or Nfs1-Isd11His, which were added to the mitochondrial lysate described above in a final 1-ml volume of 10 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.3, 100 mm NaCl, 20 mm imidazole, 0.05% Triton X-100. The final concentration of Isu1His or Nfs1-Isd11His was 0.8 μm. Binding reactions were incubated for 2 h at 4 °C on a nutator mixer. The agarose beads were washed three times in 800 μl of buffer and resuspended in 40 μl of Laemmli buffer after the last wash. Polyclonal antibodies were raised in rabbits using purified recombinant proteins as antigens. We postulated that the iron dependence of Yfh1-Isu1 interactions (5Wang T. Craig E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 12674-12679Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 6Foury F. Pastore A. Trincal M.

EMBO Rep. 2003; 4: 906-911Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar) might reflect stepwise assembly of Yfh1 monomer into trimer, 24-mer, and higher order oligomers, which occurs in an iron-dependent manner both in vitro (5Wang T. Craig E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 12674-12679Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 21Adamec J. Rusnak F. Owen W.G. Naylor S. Benson L.M. Gacy A.M. Isaya G. Am. J.

Chem. 2008; 283: 31500-31510Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). We produced recombinant forms of Yfh1, Isu1, Nfs1-Isd11, and Isd11 in E. coli (supplemental Fig. S1). To distinguish whether Yfh1 interacts with its partners in an iron- or oligomerization-dependent manner, we used iron-free wild-type Yfh1 monomer (α) as well as stable iron-free trimer (α3Y73A) and 24-mer (α24Y73A) produced during expression of the Yfh1-Y73A variant in E. coli (11Karlberg T. Schagerlöf U. Gakh O. Park S. Ryde U. Lindahl M. Leath K. Garman E. Isaya G. Al-Karadaghi S. Structure. 2006; 14: 1535-1546Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The Y73A mutation stabilizes an assembly-competent conformation of Yfh1 and thereby accelerates its assembly kinetics both in E. coli and in yeast without changing its iron-chaperone function (17Gakh O. Smith 4th, D.Y. Isaya G. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 31500-31510Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). We initially tested binding of iron-free (apo) Yfh1 proteins to Isu1His by use of a pulldown assay, a method used in previous studies of Yfh1-Isu1 interactions (5Wang T. Craig E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 12674-12679Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 7Gerber J. Mühlenhoff U. Lill R. EMBO Rep. 2003; 4: 906-911Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). Binding to Isu1His was much stronger with apo-α24Y73A protein than with apo-α or apo-α3Y73A (Fig. 1, A and B). The amounts of Yfh1 pulled down by Isu1His were not simply proportional to the number of Yfh1 subunits in monomer, trimer, and 24-mer because we obtained essentially identical results with apo-α and apo-α3Y73A. Moreover, each of the three protein preparations contained ≤0.02 atoms of iron per Yfh1 subunit, and the binding of apo-α24Y73A to Isu1His was only modestly decreased by EDTA (not shown), indicating that the interaction of Isu1His with apo-α24Y73A was mostly metal-independent. Next, α and α3Y73A were preincubated with Fe2+ aerobically under established conditions that induce stepwise assembly of monomer and trimer into 24-mer, and promote conversion of Fe2+ to Fe3+ inside Yfh1 oligomers via ferroxidase activity and autoxidation (8Park S. Gakh O. Mooney S.M. Isaya G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 38589-38595Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 16Nichol H. Gakh O. o舗Neill H.A. Pickering I.J. Isaya G. George G.N. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 5971-5976Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Binding of holo-α or holo-α3Y73A to Isu1His was stronger relative to the respective apo form and approached that of holo-α24Y73A (Fig. 1, C and D). We hypothesized that these results might reflect the presence of different levels of 24-mer in the α, α3Y73A and α24Y73A preparations before and after iron loading. To assess this, we analyzed Yfh1-Isu1His interactions in solution by gel-filtration chromatography. Isu1His was eluted in fractions with apparent molecular mass ∼44–17 kDa (Fig. 2A). An untagged version of Isu1 exhibited a very similar elution profile (supplemental Fig. S1d). The elution profiles of the apo-α, -α3Y73A, and -α24Y73A proteins showed that they contained primarily Yfh1 monomer, trimer, and 24-mer, respectively, although additional species were present in each preparation (Fig. 2 (B and F) and supplemental Fig. S2b). The distribution of Isu1His remained mostly unchanged upon incubation with apo-α or apo-α3Y73A (Fig. 2C and supplemental Fig. S2c); in contrast, a significant proportion of Isu1His was co-eluted with 24-mer upon incubation with apo-α24Y73A (Fig. 2G). When apo-α and apo-α3Y73A were preincubated with iron, they underwent iron-dependent oligomerization (Fig. 2D and supplemental Fig. S2d), and upon incubation with these proteins, most Isu1His was co-eluted with the newly assembled 24-mer (Fig. 2E and supplemental Fig. S2e). The co-elution profiles were almost indistinguishable from that obtained upon incubation of Isu1His with holo-α24Y73A (Fig. 2I). We verified that the distribution of Isu1His remained unchanged when the protein was directly incubated with iron (not provided as holo-Yfh1; supplemental Fig. S3). We also verified that untagged Isu1 exhibited very similar interactions as Isu1His upon incubation with the α preparation or α24Y73A preparation before and after iron loading (supplemental Fig. S4, a–g). Samples containing equivalent concentrations of Yfh1 (provided as holo-α24Y73A), and untagged Isu1 were analyzed by Sephacryl 300 gel-filtration chromatography (fractionation range 1.5 MDa to 10 kDa). We observed a symmetrical peak with a molecular mass of ∼400 kDa, and once again SDS-PAGE showed co-elution of 24-mer and Isu1 (Fig. 3). Together, these results indicate that Isu1 interactions with Yfh1 are initiated by Yfh1 oligomerization, which in the case of wild-type Yfh1 occurs concurrently with iron binding and oxidation. Binding of Yfh1 proteins to Nfs1-Isd11His complex was also examined by pulldown assay. Low amounts of apo-α and larger amounts of apo-α24Y73A were bound to the Nfs1-Isd11His complex (Fig. 4, A and B). Preloading the Yfh1 proteins with iron resulted in an increased affinity of holo-α for Nfs1-Isd11His to a level comparable to that of holo-α24Y73A (Fig. 4, A and B). Similar results were obtained with isolated Isd11His (Fig. 4C), suggesting that the interactions observed above were mediated at least in part by Yfh1-Isd11 contacts. Isolated Nfs1 was not available to test for direct Yfh1-Nfs1 interactions. Yfh1 (provided as holo-α) and untagged Isu1 could bind to Nfs1-Isd11His both separately and at the same time; notably, the amount of Yfh1 that was bound to Nfs1-Isd11His did not change significantly in the absence or presence of Isu1 (Fig. 4D), suggesting that different surfaces of oligomeric Yfh1 are involved in interactions with Nfs1-Isd11His and Isu1, respectively. Equivalent concentrations of Isu1His and Nfs1-Isd11His were incubated in the absence or presence of equivalent amounts of Yfh1 (as apo or holo α or α24Y73A), and interactions analyzed in solution by Sephacryl 300 gel- filtration chromatography. Isu1His was used in these experiments because it was less prone to degradation than untagged Isu1 (supplemental Fig. S1, a–d). Low levels of Isu1His were co-eluted with Nfs1-Isd11His, whereas the bulk of Isu1His was eluted in fractions between 44 and 17 kDa (Fig. 5A, fractions ∼72–84), as observed earlier by Superdex 75 gel-f"

In the reaction, N2-guanine at position 26 (m(2)G26) is generated as an intermediate. The trm1 genes are found only in archaea and eukaryotes, although it has been reported that Aquifex aeolicus, a hyper-thermophilic eubacterium, has a putative trm1 gene. To confirm whether A. aeolicus Trm1 has tRNA methyltransferase activity, we purified recombinant Trm1 protein. In vitro methyl transfer assay revealed that the protein has a strong tRNA methyltransferase activity. We confirmed that this gene product is expressed in living A. aeolicus cells and that the enzymatic activity exists in cell extract. By preparing 22 tRNA transcripts and testing their methyl group acceptance activities, it was demonstrated that this Trm1 protein has a novel tRNA specificity. Mass spectrometry analysis revealed that it catalyzes methyl transfers not only to G26 but also to G27 in substrate tRNA. Furthermore, it was confirmed that native tRNA(Cys) has an m(2)(2)G26m(2)G27 or m(2)(2)G26m(2)(2)G27 sequence, demonstrating that these modifications occur in living cells. Kinetic studies reveal that the m2G26 formation is faster than the m(2)G27 formation and that disruption of the G27-C43 base pair accelerates velocity of the G27 modification. Moreover, we prepared an additional 22 mutant tRNA transcripts and clarified that the recognition sites exist in the T-arm structure. This long distance recognition results in multisite recognition by the enzyme."

In an expression screen we identified the Netrin receptors Unc5B and Unc5D as high-affinity FLRT3 interactors. Upon overexpression, Unc5B phenocopies FLRT3 and both proteins synergize in inducing cell deadhesion in Xenopus embryos. Morpholino knock-downs of Unc5B and FLRT3 synergistically affect Xenopus development and induce morphogenetic defects. The small GTPase Rnd1, which transmits FLRT3 deadhesion activity, physically and functionally interacts with Unc5B, and mediates its effect on cell adhesion. The results suggest that FLRT3, Unc5B and Rnd1 proteins interact to modulate cell adhesion in early Xenopus development."

In HIB-1B, brown preadipocytes, forskolin increased expression of Pgc-1α, Ucp1, and C/ebpβ early in differentiation and inhibited Chop10 expression. Employing chromatin immunoprecipitation, we demonstrate that C/EBPβ, CREB, ATF-2, and CHOP10 are bound to the Pgc-1α proximal CRE, but CHOP10 does not bind in HIB-1B cell lysates.

Knockdown of Chop10 in 3T3-L1 cells using siRNA increased Pgc-1α transcription, whereas siRNA against C/ebpβ in HIB-1B cells decreased Pgc-1α and Ucp1 expression.

A remarkable feature of rodent adipose tissue is the ability to undergo a transition from white to brown adipose during cold exposure. This transition is driven by the sympathetic nervous system and enables the animal to defend its body temperature by increasing heat production due to the oxidation of fatty acids by brown adipose mitochondria, which contain the tissue-specific UCP1 (uncoupling protein 1). The inherent plasticity that allows this transition from white to brown adipose tissue is not due to a change in the number of adipocytes in a depot but to modification of white adipocytes to the brown adipocyte phenotype, sometimes referred to as “transdifferentiation” (1Cinti S. Nutr. Metab. Cardiovasc Dis. 2006; 16: 569-574Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). This change in adipocyte cell type is orchestrated by the sympathetic nervous system neurotransmitter, noradrenaline, which stimulates intracellular cAMP and activates a protein kinase A-dependent increase in UCP1 expression. Transdifferentiation from white to brown adipose tissue and/or vice versa has been reported in many species, including rodents, cats, dogs, ruminants (2Loncar D.

The nuclear receptor coactivator, PGC-1α (peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ) coactivator-1α) has also been shown to be involved in the expression of the BAT phenotype (15Puigserver P. Wu Z. Park C.W. Graves R. Wright M. Spiegelman B.M. Cell. 1998; 92: 829-839Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3077) Google Scholar). PGC-1α is expressed in a number of tissues, including brown adipose tissue, muscle, liver, and brain (16Puigserver P. Spiegelman B.M. Endocr. Rev. 2003; 24: 78-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (1613) Google Scholar). PGC-1α is induced by cold exposure or adrenergic stimulation in BAT but not WAT, and ectopic expression of PGC-1α in WAT cells induces expression of UCP1 (15Puigserver P. Wu Z. Park C.W. Graves R. Wright M. Spiegelman B.M. Cell. 1998; 92: 829-839Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3077) Google Scholar). It is also expressed in non-adipose cells under circumstances when increased metabolic energy expenditure is favored (e.g. in the liver in response to glucagon stimulation during fasting (17Herzig S. Long F. Jhala U.S. Hedrick S. Quinn R. Bauer A. Rudolph D. Schutz G. Yoon C. Puigserver P. Spiegelman B. Montminy M. Nature. 2001; 413: 179-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (1132) Google Scholar) or in exercise-conditioned muscle tissue, where it plays a role in the stimulation of oxidative capacity via its interaction with the NRF1 and -2 (nuclear respiratory factor 1 and 2) family (16Puigserver P.

Lowell B.B. Bassel-Duby R. Spiegelman B.M. Nature. 2002; 418: 797-801Crossref PubMed Scopus (2054) Google Scholar)). Expression of PGC-1α is cAMP-dependent in liver and BAT, and a major role of PGC-1α is to augment cAMP-mediated transactivation of effector genes, such as UCP1 in BAT or PEPCK in the liver (15Puigserver P. Wu Z. Park C.W. Graves R. Wright M. Spiegelman B.M. Cell. 1998; 92: 829-839Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3077) Google Scholar), (17Herzig S. Long F. Jhala U.S. Hedrick S. Quinn R. Bauer A. Rudolph D. Schutz G. Yoon C. Puigserver P. Spiegelman B. Montminy M. Nature. 2001; 413: 179-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (1132) Google Scholar). cAMP-induction of PGC-1α appears to depend primarily on a single conserved cAMP-response element (CRE) found within 200 bp of the transcription start site. Although this proximal CRE can drive PGC-1α expression in both BAT and liver, additional unidentified mechanisms operate to silence cAMP-inducible PGC-1α expression in WAT, although a range of other WAT expressed genes are cAMP-regulated (19Rosen E.D. Walkey C.J. Puigserver P. Spiegelman B.M. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1293-1307Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). CRE sites are regulatory elements that can bind a wide range of transcription factors, typically belonging to the bZIP family (20Montminy M.R. Bilezikjian L.M. Nature. 1987; 328: 175-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (964) Google Scholar). Transcription factors of the bZIP family can act as activators, non-activators, or repressors, which are regulated by different signaling pathways and influence gene expression (21Shaywitz A.J. Greenberg M.E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 821-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (1781) Google Scholar). CREB was the first protein characterized as a target of cAMP acting through CRE sites (20Montminy M.R. Bilezikjian L.M. Nature. 1987; 328: 175-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (964) Google Scholar). Subsequent to the characterization of CREB, ATF-2, c-JUN, CREM, and the C/EBPs have been described as functioning as CRE-binding proteins connecting cellular stimulation with transcription of CRE-containing genes, thus adding another layer of complexity to the CRE sites (22Bakker O. Parker M.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 1213-1217Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 23Roesler W.J. Park E.A. McFie P.J. J. Biol.

Protein kinase A activation of PGC-1α expression has been proposed to be mediated by interaction of ATF-2 and CREB, in brown adipose tissue and liver, respectively. Our previous study has demonstrated that C/EBPβ binding to the CRE on the Pgc-1α promoter is able to induce cAMP-responsive expression of Pgc-1α and Ucp1 in the white preadipocyte cell line 3T3-L1 (25Karamanlidis G.

White adipocyte differentiation is the result of a chain of transcriptional events involving CCAAT/enhancer-binding proteins C/EBPα, C/EBPβ, and C/EBPδ (26Yeh W.C. Cao Z. Classon M. McKnight S.L. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 168-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (811) Google Scholar, 27Umek R.M. Friedman A.D. McKnight S.L. Science. 1991; 251: 288-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (573) Google Scholar, 28Cao Z. Umek R.M. McKnight S.L. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 1538-1552Crossref PubMed Scopus (1344) Google Scholar) and the nuclear hormone receptor PPARγ (29Tontonoz P. Hu E. Graves R.A. Budavari A.I. Spiegelman B.M. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1224-1234Crossref PubMed Scopus (1998) Google Scholar, 30Rosen E.D. Hsu C.H. Wang X. Sakai S. Freeman M.W. Gonzalez F.J. Spiegelman B.M. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 22-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (1101) Google Scholar), which combine to induce adipogenic genes. Within 6 h of adding the hormonal mixture to induce differentiation, there is an increased expression of C/EBPβ, but this lacks DNA binding activity until much later due to the simultaneous expression of CHOP10 (C/EBP homologous protein), which sequesters and inactivates C/EBPβ by heterodimerization with its leucine zipper (31Tang Q.Q. Lane M.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2000; 97: 12446-12450Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). After a lag period, CHOP10 undergoes down-regulation, releasing C/EBPβ from inhibitory constraint, allowing transactivation of the C/EBPα and PPARγ genes, transcription factors required for terminal differentiation. The transcriptional events involved in brown adipocyte differentiation are not as well characterized, but genetic ablation studies have demonstrated that PPARγ, C/EBPβ, and C/EBPδ but not C/EBPα are also essential for this process (32Nedergaard J. Petrovic N. Lindgren E.M. Jacobsson A. Cannon B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2005; 1740: 293-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar, 33Tanaka T. Yoshida N. Kishimoto T. Akira S. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 7432-7443Crossref PubMed Scopus (640) Google Scholar). Therefore, a number of bZIP transcriptional factors interact with the CRE on the Pgc-1α proximal promoter, suggesting that adipose tissue-specific responses to cAMP may come about by different combinations of transcriptional factors binding to the CRE as has been proposed for the Pepck and Il-10 (34Park E.A.

Here we provide evidence that conversion of WAT to BAT during exposure to a cold environment involves combinatorial transcriptional factor regulation of the Pgc-1α proximal CRE, which gives rise to adipose tissue-specific expression of Pgc-1α and Ucp1 during stimulation by cAMP. Three groups of C57BL/6 mice were used, each consisting of four female individuals. All three groups were housed individually in cages measuring 48 × 15 × 13 cm with a 16-h light and 8-h dark cycle with access to bedding material. All groups had access ad libitum to a standard mouse chow diet. Mouse weight and feed consumption was measured at 24-h intervals. One group was kept at 22 ± 2 °C for 72 h; these mice comprised the warm acclimatized group. A second group was kept at 22 ± 2 °C for 48 h, followed by 8 ± 2 °C for 24 h and comprised the cold acclimatized group. The third group of 12 individuals was kept at 22 ± 2 °C for 24 h and then at 8 ± 2 °C for 24 h, followed by a return to 22 ± 2 °C for 24 h and comprised the reacclimatized group. All experiments followed institutional guidelines at the University of Aberdeen as well as those set out for animal care by the United Kingdom Home Office. Animals were euthanized by concussion, followed by cervical dislocation following Home Office guidelines. The firefly luciferase reporter gene construct containing 264 bp (264PGC1α-pGL3) from the region upstream of the rat Pgc-1α transcription start site ligated to the pGL3-Basic vector (Promega) has been described (25Karamanlidis G.

The pMSVC/EBPβ (mouse) expression plasmid that contains the respective cDNAs under the control of the mouse sarcoma virus long terminal repeat was kindly provided by S. McKnight (University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, TX). The mock plasmid pcDNA3 was from Invitrogen. The CRE-positive vector (pCRE-LUC) that contains four juxtapose copies of the consensus CRE sequence upstream of a TATA box to drive expression of the firefly luciferase gene was purchased from Stratagene. Expression vector for the truncated isoform (pSG/LIP) of C/EBPβ was provided by Birgit Gellersen (Institute for Hormone and Fertility Research, University of Hamburg, Hamburg, Germany). The expression plasmids pEBG2T-ATF2, which contained human ATF-2, and pCMV5CREB1, which contained human CREB1, were kindly provided by Philip Cohen (University of Dundee, UK). Mouse CHOP10 wild type and dominant negative (deletion of the leucine zipper domain) plasmids were supplied by David Ron (New York, NY). 3T3-L1 cells (ECACC) and HIB-1B cells (kindly provided by B. Spiegelman) were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen) in 5% CO2. For differentiation, HIB-1B cells were cultured to confluence (day 0), and then they were exposed to the differentiation mixture (0.5 mm isobutylmethylxanthine, 250 nm dexamethasone, 170 nm insulin, 10 nm T3). After 48 h, cells were maintained in medium containing 5% fetal bovine serum, 170 nm insulin, and 10 nm T3 until day 7 for harvest, and this medium was replaced daily. HIB-1B cells were transfected with luciferase plasmids using Fugene 6 (Roche Applied Science) at a charge ratio of 3:1, and 3T3-L1 cells were transfected with Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) at a charge ratio of 2:1 at 80% confluence in combination with expression vectors, where indicated, or pcDNA3 as a control. The pRL-SV40 (from Promega) that carries Renilla luciferase was also co-transfected as an internal control for monitoring the transfection efficiency. Thirty-six hours later, cells were treated with forskolin in serum-free conditions, and after 12 h, cells were harvested, and luciferase activities were analyzed using the Dual-Luciferase assay kit (Promega), as recommended by the manufacturer. Values were expressed relative to the control Renilla to allow for differences in transfection efficiency. HIB-1B and 3T3-L1 preadipocytes were grown in CultureWell™ chambered coverglasses (Invitrogen). Cells were treated with 10 μm forskolin or vehicle solution (DMSO) for 30 min and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline for 15 min. Cells were permeabilized with 0.3% (v/v) Triton X-100 for 5 min and blocked with 3% (w/v) bovine serum albumin for 1 h. After blocking, cells were incubated in 3% bovine serum albumin in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.1% Tween 20 and anti-pCREB, anti-pATF-2 (Cell Signaling), or anti-C/EBPβ (C-19; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) overnight at 4 °C. Cells were washed three times with 0.1% Tween 20 and incubated at room temperature for 1 h in the dark after adding fluorescence-labeled secondary antibody (fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG from Sigma). After washing in phosphate-buffered saline, antifade solution with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (Molecular Probes) was applied, and cells were covered with mounting solution until they were examined by fluorescence microscopy. Commercially available mouse siRNA oligonucleotides targeting C/EBPβ and CHOP10 as well as control (non-targeting) siRNA (Dharmacon) were employed to transfect HIB-1B and 3T3-L1 cells (100 nm siRNA), respectively, by the use of Dharmafect 3 (Dharmacon) according to the manufacturer's protocol. In cotransfection experiments involving siRNAs, the siRNA was added to the well when cells reached 60% confluence, and plasmid transfection was performed 24 h later. HIB-1B cells were kept in serum-free medium for 4 h after transfection, which was replaced with medium containing 20% fetal bovine serum to maximize cell growth and prevent potential cytotoxicity. Cells were harvested 72 h after transfection for RNA extraction. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays were performed according to the manufacturer's protocol (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc., Lake Placid, NY). Briefly, HIB-1B and 3T3-L1 preadipocytes were transfected with pcDNA3 or pMSVC/EBPβ, and 48 h later (at confluence), they were stimulated with forskolin (10 μm) or DMSO for 1 h. Protein-DNA cross-linking was achieved by adding formaldehyde (1% final concentration) for 1 h at 37 °C. The cells were washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in SDS lysis buffer (3% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 10 mm EDTA, and 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1) supplemented with protease inhibitors. The whole cell lysates were sonicated with a Soniprep 150 for 30 s at the maximum setting. This was repeated eight times with 1-min intervals between each 30-s pulse, yielding chromatin fragments between 200 and 500 bp in size. Lysates were centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 10 min, and the resulting supernatants were diluted 10-fold with ChIP dilution buffer in the presence of protease inhibitors. Normal rabbit IgG (sc-2027; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and salmon sperm DNA, 50% protein A-agarose slurry (80 μl) was added to the lysates, which were incubated for 30 min at 4 °C to reduce nonspecific background. Agarose beads were precipitated by brief centrifugation, and the supernatant was collected. Antibodies against CREB (Upstate Biotechnology), C/EBPβ, ATF-2 (N-96; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), CHOP10 (F-168; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), or preimmune serum (negative control) were added to the 2-ml supernatant fraction, and the mixture was incubated overnight at 4 °C with rotation. The immunocomplexes were collected by binding to 60 μl of salmon sperm DNA-Protein A-agarose slurry after incubation for 1 h at 4 °C with rotation. The antibody-histone-DNA complexes were washed sequentially with low salt buffer, high salt buffer, lithium chloride wash buffer, and TE buffer. The pellets were then eluted, and reversal of cross-linking was done by heating at 65 °C overnight in the presence of NaCl. Purification of DNA was done with a QIAquick PCR purification kit (Qiagen), and the obtained DNA fragments were analyzed by PCR using the following primer pairs for the mouse Pgc-1α promoter: forward, 5′-GGGCTGCCTTGGAGTGACGTC-3′; reverse, 5′-AGTCCCCAGTCACATGACAAAG-3′. Western blotting on whole cell lysates was performed as reported previously (25Karamanlidis G. Karamitri A. Docherty K. Hazlerigg D.G. Lomax M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 24660-24669Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Immunological detection was performed using antibodies directed against CREB (1:1000 dilution), ATF-2 (1:500 dilution), CHOP10 (1:350 dilution), C/EBPβ (1:500 dilution), and actin (1:250 dilution; Sigma). The antigen-antibody complex was detected by incubating the membrane for 1 h at room temperature in buffer containing a 1:1000 dilution of horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG secondary antibody (Cell Signaling) and visualized with SuperSignal West Pico blotting substrate (Pierce). Total RNA was extracted from cultured cells by use of TRI reagent (Sigma). Prior to RT-PCR, samples were treated with DNA-free DNase to remove contaminating genomic or plasmid DNA. cDNA was generated using the cDNA synthesis kit from Qiagen. Quantitative real time PCR (qRT-PCR) was performed using SYBR Green (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions in a Rotor Gene 3000 thermal cycler (Corbert Research). The sequences of the primers used for real time PCR were Pgc-1α sense (GCGCCGTGTGATTTACGTT) and antisense (AAAACTTCAAAGCGGTCTCTCAA), Ucp1 sense (CCTGCCTCTCTCGGAAACAA) and antisense (TGTAGGCTGCCCAATGAACA), C/ebpα sense (CCGGGAGAACTCTAACTC) and antisense (GATGTAGGCGCTGATGT), C/ebpβ sense (GCAAGAGCCGCGACAAG) and antisense (GGCTCGGGCAGCTGCTT), C/ebpδ sense (ACGACGAGAGCGCCATC) and antisense (TCGCCGTCGCCCCAGTC), Chop10 sense (AGAGGAAGAATCAAAAACCTTCACT) and antisense (ACTCTGTTTCCGTTTCCTAGTTCTT), and 18 S rRNA sense (GTAACCCGTTGAACCCCATT) and antisense (CCATCCAATCGGTAGTAGCG). Expression levels for all genes were normalized to the internal control 18 S rRNA. All of the data were analyzed with either Student's t test or two-way analysis of variance. We have previously demonstrated that C/EBPβ overexpression was able to increase Pgc-1α and Ucp1 expression in response to cAMP stimulation in 3T3-L1 cells, suggesting that C/EBPβ is implicated in sympathetic neural stimulation of brown adipose tissue recruitment in white adipose tissue depots. We first set out to demonstrate that the increase in Pgc-1α and Ucp1 expression in adipose tissue in response to cold stress was associated with increased C/ebpβ expression. Maintaining mice for 24 h in a cold environment at 8 °C compared with 22 °C significantly increased mRNA levels for both Pgc-1α (p < 0.05) and Ucp1 (p < 0.01; Fig. 1, A and B) in interscapular BAT (iBAT), and these changes were reversed within 24 h of reacclimatization of cold-maintained animals back to a warm environment. Interscapular WAT (iWAT) represents tissue that was distinguishable from iBAT by visual dissection, and as expected, both Pgc-1α and Ucp1 expression were lower compared with iBAT. The increase in Pgc-1α and Ucp1 expression in iWAT (p < 0.01) in animals maintained in the cold was presumably due to a population of iWAT contaminated with iBAT (Fig. 1, A and B). There was a small but significant (p < 0.01) induction of Ucp1 expression in gonadal WAT, which is likely to be due to BAT recruitment of small pockets of cells previously observed in WAT (Fig. 1A). Ucp1 was not expressed in liver. Pgc-1α was expressed at lower levels in gonadal WAT and liver and was not altered by housing temperature. When tissue mRNA for the three C/EBP isomers was measured (Fig. 1, C–E), there were no significant effects of housing temperature on C/ebpα and C/ebpδ levels in any of the tissues studied, but C/ebpβ expression was significantly (p < 0.01) increased by the cold housing treatment in iBAT, iWAT, and liver but not gonadal WAT. Similar to Pgc-1α and Ucp1, levels of C/ebpβ mRNA were highest in iBAT, and responses to the cold environment were rapidly reversed by 24-h reacclimatization in the warmth. Exposure to cold has previously been reported to increase C/ebpβ but not C/ebpα or C/ebpδ in iBAT (37Rehnmark S. Antonson P. Xanthopoulos K.G. Jacobsson A. FEBS Lett. 1993; 318: 235-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 38Manchado C. Yubero P. Viñas O. Iglesias R. Villarroya F. Mampel T. Giralt M. Biochem. J. 1994; 302: 695-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), indicating a positive association of C/EBPβ gene expression with Pgc-1α and Ucp1. We next assessed the levels of Chop10, which has been reported to act as a dominant negative transcription factor of C/EBPs (Fig. 1F); Chop10 was not altered by environmental temperature in liver and decreased in iBAT (p = 0.05) but was increased (p < 0.01) by the cold treatment in gonadal WAT and iWAT. Having demonstrated that changes in adipose tissue expression of C/ebpβ in response to transitions from warm to cold and cold to warm environments followed the same pattern as Pgc-1α and Ucp1 expression, we next sought to examine these associations during differentiation in the brown adipocyte cell line, HIB-1B. Expression of Ucp1 was significantly (p < 0.01) increased by treatment with forskolin, compared with basal DMSO-treated cells at confluence (Fig. 2A), as we have previously demonstrated (25Karamanlidis G. Karamitri A. Docherty K. Hazlerigg D.G. Lomax M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 24660-24669Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). This response disappeared 12 and 24 h after inducing differentiation but returned by 36 h and increased to 7 days after induction, when lipid droplets can be observed in HIB-1B cells. Basal Ucp1 mRNA expression was low throughout the differentiation protocol unless stimulated by cAMP with forskolin (39Ross S.R. Choy L. Graves R.A. Fox N. Solevjeva V. Klaus S. Ricquier D.

https://openalex.org/W2063191450,"Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease is caused by mutations in the genes encoding polycystin-1 (PC-1) and polycystin-2 (PC-2). PC-1 cleavage releases its cytoplasmic C-terminal tail (CTT), which enters the nucleus. To determine whether PC-1 CTT cleavage is influenced by PC-2, a quantitative cleavage assay was utilized, in which the DNA binding and activation domains of Gal4 and VP16, respectively, were appended to PC-1 downstream of its CTT domain (PKDgalvp). Cells cotransfected with the resultant PKDgalvp fusion protein and PC-2 showed an increase in luciferase activity and in CTT expression, indicating that the C-terminal tail of PC-1 is cleaved and enters the nucleus. To assess whether CTT cleavage depends upon Ca2+ signaling, cells transfected with PKDgalvp alone or together with PC-2 were incubated with several agents that alter intracellular Ca2+ concentrations. PC-2 enhancement of luciferase activity was not altered by any of these treatments. Using a series of PC-2 C-terminal truncated mutations, we identified a portion of the PC-2 protein that is required to stimulate PC-1 CTT accumulation. These data demonstrate that release of the CTT from PC-1 is influenced and stabilized by PC-2. This effect is independent of Ca2+ but is regulated by sequences contained within the PC-2 C-terminal tail, suggesting a mechanism through which PC-1 and PC-2 may modulate a novel signaling pathway."
https://openalex.org/W2066083913,"We characterized three d-galactosyl-beta1-->3-N-acetyl-d-hexosamine phosphorylase (EC 2.4.1.211) homologs from Clostridium phytofermentans (Cphy0577, Cphy1920, and Cphy3030 proteins). Cphy0577 and Cphy3030 proteins exhibited similar activity on galacto-N-biose (GNB; d-Gal-beta1-->3-d-GalNAc) and lacto-N-biose I (LNB; d-Gal-beta1-->3-d-GlcNAc), thus indicating that they are d-galactosyl-beta1-->3-N-acetyl-d-hexosamine phosphorylases, subclassified as GNB/LNB phosphorylase. In contrast, Cphy1920 protein phosphorolyzed neither GNB nor LNB. It showed the highest activity with l-rhamnose as the acceptor in the reverse reaction using alpha-d-galactose 1-phosphate as the donor. The reaction product was d-galactosyl-beta1-->4-l-rhamnose. The enzyme also showed activity on l-mannose, l-lyxose, d-glucose, 2-deoxy-d-glucose, and d-galactose in this order. When d-glucose derivatives were used as acceptors, reaction products were beta-1,3-galactosides. Kinetic parameters of phosphorolytic activity on d-galactosyl-beta1-->4-l-rhamnose were k(cat) = 45 s(-1) and K(m) = 7.9 mm, thus indicating that these values are common among other phosphorylases. We propose d-galactosyl-beta1-->4-l-rhamnose phosphorylase as the name for Cphy1920 protein."
https://openalex.org/W2079518897,"Earlier studies have reported a role for lipooligosaccharides (LOSs) in sliding motility, biofilm formation, and infection of host macrophages in Mycobacterium marinum. Although a LOS biosynthetic gene cluster has recently been identified in this species, many structural features of the different LOSs (LOS-I–IV) are still unknown. This clearly hampers assessing the contribution of each LOS in mycobacterial virulence as well as structure-function-based studies of these important cell wall-associated glycolipids. In this study, we have identified an M. marinum isolate, M. marinum 7 (Mma7), which failed to produce LOS-IV but instead accumulated large amounts of LOS-III. Local genomic comparison of the LOS biosynthetic cluster established the presence of a highly disorganized region in Mma7 compared with the standard M strain, characterized by multiple genetic lesions that are likely to be responsible for the defect in LOS-IV production in Mma7. Our results indicate that the glycosyltransferase LosA alone is not sufficient to ensure LOS-IV biosynthesis. The availability of different M. marinum strains allowed us to determine the precise structure of individual LOSs through the combination of mass spectrometric and NMR techniques. In particular, we established the presence of two related 4-C-branched monosaccharides within LOS-II to IV sequences, of which one was never identified before. In addition, we provided evidence that LOSs are capable of inhibiting the secretion of tumor necrosis factor-α in lipopolysaccharide-stimulated human macrophages. This unexpected finding suggests that these cell wall-associated glycolipids represent key effectors capable of interfering with the establishment of a pro-inflammatory response. Earlier studies have reported a role for lipooligosaccharides (LOSs) in sliding motility, biofilm formation, and infection of host macrophages in Mycobacterium marinum.

This unexpected finding suggests that these cell wall-associated glycolipids represent key effectors capable of interfering with the establishment of a pro-inflammatory response. A key feature of all members of the genus Mycobacterium is a cell wall of unique and complex structure, which plays an important role in antibiotic resistance and pathogenesis of mycobacteria by modulating the host immune system and phagocytic cell functions (1Karakousis P.C. Bishai W.R. Dorman S.E. Cell. Microbiol. 2004; 6: 105-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). The mycobacterial cell wall includes essentially two types of lipids, the mycolic acids, which are very long chain fatty acids covalently bound to the arabinogalactan polysaccharide attached to a peptidoglycan backbone (2Kremer L. Baulard A.R. Besra G.S. Hatfull G.F. Jacobs Jr., W.R. Molecular Genetics of Mycobacteria.

However, they remain among the less studied mycobacterial glycolipids at a biosynthetic, structural, and functional point of view. To date, only three genes have been experimentally demonstrated to be involved in the late steps of LOS biosynthesis in M. marinum (16Burguière A. Hitchen P.G. Dover L.G. Kremer L. Ridell M.

Islam S.T. Alexander D.C. Chen J.M. Besra G.S. Liu J. Mol. Microbiol. 2007; 63: 1345-1359Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), and one gene encodes a polyketide synthase responsible for the synthesis of the polymethyl-branched fatty acid in the Mycobacterium smegmatis LOS (18Etienne G. Malaga W. Laval F. Lemassu A. Guilhot C. Daffé M. J. Bacteriol. 2009; 191: 2613-2621Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). LOSs represent highly antigenic glycoconjugates exposed to the cell surface and useful target molecules for serotyping in a given mycobacterial species. Their precise role in mycobacteria virulence as well as in the colony morphology remains unclear (19Belisle J.T. Brennan P.J. J. Bacteriol. 1989; 171: 3465-3470Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 20Lemassu A. Lévy-Frébault V.V. Lanéelle M.A. Daffé M. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1992; 138: 1535-1541Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Early studies demonstrated that rough variants of M. kansasii, devoid of all LOSs, induce chronic systemic infections in mice, whereas smooth variants containing LOSs are rapidly cleared from the organs of infected animals (19Belisle J.T. Brennan P.J. J. Bacteriol. 1989; 171: 3465-3470Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 21Collins F.M. Cunningham D.S. Infect. Immun. 1981; 32: 614-624Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It was therefore proposed that LOSs may act as avirulence factors by masking other cell wall-associated virulence factors. Accordingly, LOSs are absent in most clinical isolates of M. tuberculosis as well as in the laboratory strain H37Rv. A recent genetically based comparison of the LOS biosynthetic cluster in M. marinum and M. tuberculosis revealed that only about one-third of the genes are conserved between the two species, with the genetic locus of M. tuberculosis H37Rv containing fewer genes (17Ren H. Dover L.G. Islam S.T. Alexander D.C. Chen J.M. Besra G.S. Liu J. Mol. Microbiol. 2007; 63: 1345-1359Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Although recent studies suggested a possible role of LOSs in sliding motility, biofilm formation, and infection of macrophages by M. marinum (17Ren H. Dover L.G. Islam S.T. Alexander D.C. Chen J.M. Besra G.S. Liu J. Mol. Microbiol. 2007; 63: 1345-1359Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), the precise contribution of LOSs to M. marinum pathogenesis or virulence is seriously hampered by the restricted number of isogenic strains deficient in their production and the lack of precise structural data of LOS variants. LOSs from different mycobacterial species exhibit considerable variations in the glycan core. A previous work identified the presence of four major LOS variants in M. marinum, designated LOS-I to LOS-IV (16Burguière A. Hitchen P.G. Dover L.G. Kremer L. Ridell M. Alexander D.C. Liu J. Morris H.R. Minnikin D.E. Dell A. Besra G.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 42124-42133Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Through partial characterization, the structure of LOS-I was previously established as 3-O-Me-Rhap-(1–3)-Glcp-(1–3)-Glcp-(1–4)-Glcp-(1–1)-Glcp. Although all LOSs were shown to contain this common oligosaccharidic core substituted by an additional Xylp unit, LOS-II, -III, and -IV are further substituted by other unidentified monosaccharides, designated X and YZ, which leave their exact sequence largely unknown (16Burguière A. Hitchen P.G. Dover L.G. Kremer L. Ridell M. Alexander D.C. Liu J. Morris H.R. Minnikin D.E. Dell A. Besra G.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 42124-42133Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). In this study, we report the identification of a natural mutant of M. marinum, devoid of LOS-IV production, which allowed the production of large amounts of LOS-III and the determination of the fine structure of all LOSs. In addition, the availability of all LOS variants with defined structures has opened the possibility to undertake structure-function relationship studies. These molecules were therefore used in in vitro assays to uncover their potent biological roles. M. marinum isolates, originating from infected fish or humans, used in this study were described previously (22van der Sar A.M. Abdallah A.M. Sparrius M. Reinders E. Vandenbroucke-Grauls C.M. Bitter W. Infect. Immun. 2004; 72: 6306-6312Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). The reference strain M, a human isolate (23Stinear T.P. Seemann T. Harrison P.F. Jenkin G.A. Davies J.K.

Genome Res. 2008; 18: 729-741Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar), was also included in this work. Bacteria were grown at 30 °C on plates containing Middlebrook 7H10 supplemented with oleic acid/albumin/dextrose/catalase enrichment or in Sauton's broth medium. Restriction enzymes, T4 DNA ligase, and Vent DNA polymerase were purchased from New England Biolabs. M. marinum genomic DNA was prepared as described previously (24Kremer L. Gurcha S.S. Bifani P. Hitchen P.G. Baulard A. Morris H.R. Dell A. Brennan P.J. Besra G.S. Biochem. J. 2002; 363: 437-447Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Probes were labeled with digoxigenin (DIG-dUTP-5′) using the PCR DIG probe synthesis kit (Roche Applied Science), and Southern blot hybridization was performed as described earlier (24Kremer L. Gurcha S.S. Bifani P. Hitchen P.G. Baulard A. Morris H.R. Dell A. Brennan P.J. Besra G.S. Biochem. J. 2002; 363: 437-447Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Detection was performed using the DIG luminescence detection kit (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. PCR amplification of Rv1500, the gene homologous to losA in M. tuberculosis, was performed using H37Rv genomic DNA along with the upstream primer 5′-TGC GCC TCT CAA TCG TAA CGA CTA T-3′ and downstream primer 5′-AAA GGAATTCTG CAG ATG TAA GAT GG-3′, which contains an EcoRI site (underlined). The 1360-bp product was then digested with EcoRI and cloned into the MscI/EcoRI-restricted pMV261, a mycobacterial shuttle vector containing the hsp60 promoter (25Stover C.K. de la Cruz V.F. Fuerst T.R. Burlein J.E. Benson L.A. Bennett L.T. Bansal G.P. Young J.F. Lee M.H. Hatfull G.F. Nature. 1991; 351: 456-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (1199) Google Scholar), thus giving rise to pMV261-Rv1500. Mma7 was transformed with this plasmid or pMV261, and polar lipids were extracted. Polar and apolar lipids were extracted according to established procedures (16Burguière A. Hitchen P.G. Dover L.G. Kremer L. Ridell M. Alexander D.C. Liu J. Morris H.R. Minnikin D.E. Dell A. Besra G.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 42124-42133Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Polar lipid extracts were examined by two-dimensional TLC on plates of Silica Gel 60 (Merck), using chloroform/methanol/water (60:30:6, v/v) in the first direction and chloroform/acetic acid/methanol/water (40:25:3:6, v/v) in the second direction. Glycolipids were visualized by spraying plates with orcinol/sulfuric acid reagent (0.2%, w/v, orcinol in H2SO4/water, 1:4, v/v) followed by charring. Lipids were also visualized by spraying with 5% ethanolic molybdophosphoric acid and charring. Phosphate-containing lipids were stained and visualized using the Dittmer and Lester reagent. To purify LOSs, the crude polar extract was dissolved in chloroform/methanol (2:1, v/v) and applied in a DEAE-cellulose column (2 × 30 cm) for purification. The column was eluted with chloroform/methanol (500 ml; 2:1, v/v) and increasing concentrations of ammonium acetate (5–500 mm) in chloroform/methanol (2:1, v/v). The purification process was monitored by one-dimensional TLC using chloroform/acetic acid/methanol/water (40:25:3:6, v/v). Glycolipids were visualized by spraying plates with orcinol/sulfuric acid reagent followed by charring. LOS-I, -II, and -III were co-eluted from the DEAE column using chloroform/methanol (2:1, v/v), whereas LOS-IV was eluted from DEAE in the presence of 40–60 mm ammonium acetate in chloroform/methanol (2:1, v/v). DEAE fractions containing LOS-I to LOS-III were concentrated and applied on a silicate gel column for a second purification step. The column was eluted with chloroform (500 ml) and chloroform/methanol with increasing volumes of methanol (1–80%). LOS-I was eluted in a fraction containing 15% methanol, and LOS-II and LOS-III were co-eluted in the presence of 20% methanol. LOS-I to LOS-IV were further purified into individual species by preparative TLC on 20 × 20-cm high performance TLC plates of Silica Gel 60 (Merck) and run in chloroform/acetic acid/methanol/water (40:25:3:6, v/v). Glycolipids and lipids were revealed by iodine vapors. Spots corresponding to the glycolipids were scraped from the plates, and the glycolipids were extracted using chloroform/methanol (2:1, v/v) and finally purified on Sep-pack C18 cartridge (Waters, Milford, CT). Purification of TDM was realized from extracted apolar glycolipids. Briefly, apolar glycolipids were dissolved in chloroform and applied on Florisil® column chromatography (Acros Organics). The column was eluted with chloroform (500 ml) and chloroform/methanol with increasing volumes of methanol (1–50%). The purification process was monitored by one-dimensional high performance TLC using chloroform/methanol (90:10, v/v). TDM was visualized by spraying plates with orcinol/sulfuric acid reagent followed by heating the plates at 120 °C. TDM was eluted in fraction containing 10% of methanol. TDM-containing fractions were pooled and applied on a second Florisil® column chromatography eluted with chloroform (500 ml) and chloroform/methanol with increasing volumes of methanol (1–20%). Purity of TDM was checked by MALDI-MS and NMR. LOSs were de-O-acylated in chloroform/methanol (2:1, v/v) containing 0.1 mm NaOH at 37 °C for 2 h. Solvents were evaporated, and the resulting oligosaccharides were dissolved in water and further purified on a carbograph column (Alltech carbograph SPE column). Permethylation (or perdeuteromethylation) was performed according to the procedure of Ciucanu and Kerek (26Ciucanu I. Kerek F. Carbohydr. Res. 1984; 131: 209-217Crossref Scopus (3190) Google Scholar). Briefly, compounds were incubated overnight in a suspension of 200 mg/ml NaOH in dry DMSO (300 ml) and iodomethane (200 ml) (or iododeuteromethane). The methylated (or deuteromethylated) products were extracted in chloroform and washed with water. The reagents were evaporated, and the sample was dissolved in methanol prior to mass spectrometry analysis. Permethylated samples were hydrolyzed with 4 m trifluoroacetic acid for 2 h at 100 °C and reduced with 10 mg/ml sodium NaBH4 in 0.5 m aqueous ammonium hydroxide solution at room temperature for 4 h, and the reaction was terminated by adding a few drops of acetic acid. Samples were dried and acetylated with acetic anhydride at 100 °C for 4 h. The reagent was removed under nitrogen stream and sample dissolved in chloroform. The chloroform phase was then washed several times with water before gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis using a Carlo Erba GC 8000 gas chromatograph equipped with a 25-m × 0.32-mm CP-Sil5 CB low bleed/MS capillary column, 0.25-μm film phase (Chrompack). Temperature of the Ross injector was 280 °C, and samples were analyzed using a temperature program starting at 100 °C for 1 min, followed by a temperature ramp of 5 °C min−1 to 300 °C. Electron ionization-mass spectra were obtained using a Finnigan Automass II mass spectrometer. The molecular masses of polysaccharides were measured by MALDI-TOF on a Voyager Elite reflectron mass spectrometer (PerSeptive Biosystems, Framingham, MA), equipped with a 337 nm UV laser. Native and permethylated samples were prepared by mixing directly on the target 1 ml of the methanol (native and permethylated)-diluted oligosaccharide solution and 1 ml of 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid matrix solution (10 mg/ml dissolved in acetonitrile/H2O). Nano-electrospray mass spectrometric analyses were performed using a QSTAR Pulsar quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometer (AB/MDS Sciex, Toronto, Canada) equipped with a nanoelectrospray ion source (Protana, Odense, Denmark). Samples were dissolved at a concentration of 10 pmol/μl in methanol/water (50:50, v/v), 0.1% formic acid and sprayed from gold-coated “medium length” borosilicate capillaries (Protana, Odense, Denmark). A potential of 800 V was applied to the capillary tip, and the declustering potential and the focusing potential were set at 120 and 180 V, respectively. For the recording of conventional mass spectra, TOF data were acquired by accumulation of 10 multiple channel acquisition scans over the m/z range 400–2000. In the collision-induced dissociation (MS/MS) analyses, multiple charged ions were fragmented using nitrogen as collision gas (5.3 × 10−3 torr), and the collision energy varied between 40 and 80 eV to obtain maximal fragmentation. The collision-induced dissociation spectra were recorded on the orthogonal TOF analyzer over a range of m/z 100–1400. Signal detection was performed with a multichannel plate detector and time to digital conversion. Resolution was measured as the full width at half-maximum and was 7000 in the measured mass ranges. External calibration was performed prior to each measure using a 1 pmol/μl solution of glufibrinopeptide in methanol/water (50:50, v/v). NMR experiments were performed on a Bruker NMR spectrometer 9.4 teslas (where 1H resonated at 400.33 MHz and 13C at 100.66 MHz) and on a Bruker NMR spectrometer 14.1 teslas (where 1H resonated at 600.13 MHz and 13C at 150.91 MHz) equipped with a cryo-probe head. Prior to NMR spectroscopic analyses, LOS-I–IV were repeatedly exchanged in CD3OD (99.97% purity, Euriso-top®, CEA Saclay, France) with intermediate drying and then dissolved in CDCl3/CD3OD (2:1, v/v) (Euriso-top®). 1H and 13C chemical shifts are given in parts/million downfield from internal tetramethylsilane at 0 ppm. OS-II and OS-IV were repeatedly exchanged in 2H2O (99.97% 2H, Euriso-top®) with intermediate freeze-drying and finally dissolved in 2H2O (Euriso-top®) in Shigemi® tubes (Allison Park). Chemical shifts (parts/million) were calibrated taking methyl groups from internal acetone at δ1H 2.225 and 13C at 31.55 ppm. All experiments were recorded at 300 K without sample spinning. The Bruker pulse programs were used and optimized (pulse lengths and delays) for each one- or two-dimensional experiments. RPMI 1640 medium, l-glutamine were purchased from Invitrogen, and fetal calf serum (FCS) was from Dominique Dutscher (Brumath, France). The 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 was provided by Calbiochem. The human TNF-α protein detection kit was from ABCys. By LPS from Salmonella typhimurium was purchased from Alexis Corp. Lipomannan (LM) was purified from MmaM using procedures reported previously (27Guerardel Y. Maes E. Elass E. Leroy Y. Timmerman P. Besra G.S. Locht C. Strecker G. Kremer L. J. Biol.

The model bacterial lipopeptide Pam3Cys-SKKKK (Pam3CSK4) was purchased from EMC microcollections GmbH (Germany). The human promonocytic leukemia THP-1 cell line was grown in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% FCS, 2 mml-glutamine, and 2 × 10−5m β-mercaptoethanol in a 5% CO2 air-humidified atmosphere at 37 °C. THP-1 cells were differentiated by treatment for 72 h with 50 nm 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (29Vey E. Zhang J.H. Dayer J.M. J. Immunol. 1992; 149: 2040-2046PubMed Google Scholar). Viability of cells was over 96% as determined by trypan blue dye exclusion. To investigate the effect of LOSs on TNF-α secretion, differentiated THP-1 cells were seeded in 96-well plastic culture plates at a density of 2 × 105 cells/well, in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 5% FCS and l-glutamine. Purified LOSs as well as TDM were resuspended in ethanol and hexane, respectively, and sonicated for 3 min. These glycolipids were coated on plates at the indicated concentrations, which were subsequently dried at 37 °C to ensure complete solvent evaporation. Control wells were layered with solvent without glycolipids. Additionally, purified LM (used as positive control) was dissolved in apyrogen water and sonicated before addition to the cells. After 6 h of incubation, culture supernatants of triplicates were then collected and centrifuged prior to quantitation of cytokines by ELISA, according to the manufacturers' instructions. Cytokines concentrations present in the supernatants were obtained in comparison with a standard curve generated with recombinant human TNF-α. To investigate the TNF-α-inhibitory properties of LOS-II and LOS-IV on stimulated macrophages, THP-1 cells were pretreated with LOSs for 20 h prior to the addition of either LPS (20 ng/ml) or Pam3CSK4 (20 ng/ml) and incubated for a further 6 h. Supernatants were processed for cytokine quantification as mentioned above. Viability of the cells was checked by flow cytometry (FACSCalibur flow cytometer) by using propidium iodide. Statistical significance was analyzed with a Student's t test for unpaired data. Values of p < 0.05 were considered to be significant. LOSs are highly antigenic glycoconjugates exposed at the cell surface of several mycobacterial species, but their precise role in virulence and colony morphology is still a matter of debate (19Belisle J.T. Brennan P.J. J. Bacteriol. 1989; 171: 3465-3470Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 20Lemassu A. Lévy-Frébault V.V. Lanéelle M.A. Daffé M. J. Gen.

Nevertheless, recent studies on M. marinum mutants carrying transposon insertions in the LOS biosynthetic cluster indicated that LOSs participate in sliding motility, biofilm formation and infection of host macrophages (17Ren H.

Deciphering the biological properties of LOSs requires fine structural determination and to date, only a partial structure of M. marinum LOSs is available (16Burguière A. Hitchen P.G. Dover L.G.

Structure-function relationship studies are also hampered by the lack of detailed structural information, which can be attributed to the failure of obtaining high yields of the purified LOS variants, and particularly of the more polar ones (16Burguière A. Hitchen P.G. Dover L.G. Kremer L. Ridell M. Alexander D.C. Liu J. Morris H.R. Minnikin D.E. Dell A. Besra G.S. J. Biol.

We reasoned that screening a set of M. marinum isolates from various origins would allow us to select “natural” mutants affected in their quantitative and/or qualitative LOS content, representing interesting sources for subsequent LOS production and purification. Therefore, we included in our study unrelated M. marinum strains isolated either from humans with fish tank granuloma (Mma20, Mma21, and Mma98) or from different poikilothermic species (Mma7, Mma11), which, when injected into adult zebrafish, developed an acute or a chronic disease (22van der Sar A.M.

https://openalex.org/W2141639846,"Background Proteolysis of huntingtin (Htt) plays a key role in the pathogenesis of Huntington's disease (HD). However, the environmental cues and signaling pathways that regulate Htt proteolysis are poorly understood. One stimulus may be the DNA damage that accumulates in neurons over time, and the subsequent activation of signaling pathways such as those regulated by IκB kinase (IKK), which can influence neurodegeneration in HD. Methodology/Principal Findings We asked whether DNA damage induces the proteolysis of Htt and if activation of IKK plays a role. We report that treatment of neurons with the DNA damaging agent etoposide or γ-irradiation promotes cleavage of wild type (WT) and mutant Htt, generating N-terminal fragments of 80–90 kDa. This event requires IKKβ and is suppressed by IKKα. Elevated levels of IKKα, or inhibition of IKKβ expression by a specific small hairpin RNA (shRNA) or its activity by sodium salicylate, prevents Htt proteolysis and increases neuronal resistance to DNA damage. Moreover, IKKβ phosphorylates the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-xL, a modification known to reduce Bcl-xL levels, and activates caspases that can cleave Htt. When IKKβ expression is blocked, etoposide treatment does not decrease Bcl-xL and activation of caspases is diminished. Similar to silencing of IKKβ, increasing the level of Bcl-xL in neurons prevents etoposide-induced caspase activation and Htt proteolysis. Conclusions/Significance These results indicate that DNA damage triggers cleavage of Htt and identify IKKβ as a prominent regulator. Moreover, IKKβ-dependent reduction of Bcl-xL is important in this process. Thus, inhibition of IKKβ may promote neuronal survival in HD as well as other DNA damage-induced neurodegenerative disorders."

We isolated and characterized a novel POZ domain Krüppel-like zinc finger transcription repressor, ZBTB5 (zinc finger and BTB domain-containing 5). Serial analysis of gene expression (SAGE) analysis showed that ZBTB5 expression is higher in retinoblastoma and muscle cancer tissues. Immunocytochemistry showed that ZBTB5 was localized to the nucleus, particularly nuclear speckles. ZBTB5 directly repressed transcription of cell cycle arrest gene p21 by binding to the proximal GC-box 5/6 elements and the two distal p53-responsive elements (bp −2323 ∼ −2299; bp −1416 ∼ −1392). Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays showed that ZBTB5 and p53 competed with each other in occupying the p53 binding elements. ZBTB5 interacted with co-repressor-histone deacetylase complexes such as BCoR (BCL-6-interacting corepressor), NCoR (nuclear receptor corepressor), and SMRT (silencing mediator for retinoid and thyroid receptors) via its POZ domain. These interactions resulted in deacetylation of histones Ac-H3 and Ac-H4 at the proximal promoter, which is important in the transcriptional repression of p21. MTT (3-(4,5-di meth yl thi azol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide) assays and fluorescent-activated cell sorter analysis revealed that ZBTB5 stimulated both cell proliferation and cell cycle progression, significantly increasing the number of cells in S-phase.

This characteristic probably underlies many biological processes controlled by these factors.

Whereas induction of p21 predominantly leads to cell cycle arrest, repression of p21 may have a variety of outcomes depending on the cellular context (Ref. 29Gartel A.L. Radhakrishnan S.K. Cancer Res. 2005; 65: 3980-3985Crossref PubMed Scopus (701) Google Scholar and references therein). Aside from p53, a variety of other factors including specificity proteins 1 and 3 (Sp1/Sp3), Smads, Ap2, STAT, BRCA1, E2F-1/E2F-3, and C/EBPα and -β activate the transcription of p21 (29Gartel A.L. Radhakrishnan S.K. Cancer Res. 2005; 65: 3980-3985Crossref PubMed Scopus (701) Google Scholar and references therein). In addition to its role responding to DNA damage, p21 has also been implicated in terminal differentiation, replicative senescence, and protection from p53-dependent and -independent apoptosis (Ref. 29Gartel A.L. Radhakrishnan S.K. Cancer Res. 2005; 65: 3980-3985Crossref PubMed Scopus (701) Google Scholar and references therein). Sp1 family transcription factors that bind at the proximal promoter (bp −120 to −50) represent another group of major regulators that affect p21 gene expression (Ref. 29Gartel A.L. Radhakrishnan S.K. Cancer Res. 2005; 65: 3980-3985Crossref PubMed Scopus (701) Google Scholar and references therein). Sp1 is one of the best characterized transcription factors that bind to GC-rich DNA sequences in numerous cellular and viral genes (Refs. 33Kadonaga J.T. Carner K.R. Masiarz F.R. Tjian R. Cell. 1987; 51: 1079-1090Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1255) Google Scholar and 34Kaczynski J. Cook T. Urrutia R. Genome Biology. 2003; 4: 206.1-206.8Crossref Scopus (749) Google Scholar and references therein). The six Sp1 binding GC boxes of the p21 proximal promoter have been shown to be important; mutation of the sites not only significantly affects transcription but also disrupts synergistic transcription activation by Sp1 and p53 and other signals that regulate p21 gene transcription (29Gartel A.L. Radhakrishnan S.K. Cancer Res. 2005; 65: 3980-3985Crossref PubMed Scopus (701) Google Scholar, 35Koutsodontis G. Tentes I. Papakosta P. Moustakas A. Kardassis D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 29116-29125Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Among the six GC boxes found in this region, GC-box 3 mediates p21 induction by various agents such as transforming growth factor-β, butyrate, the histone deacetylase inhibitor trichostatin A, lovastatin, and Ca2+. In contrast, GC-boxes 1 and 2 mediate transcriptional activation by phorbol esters and okadaic acid, the tumor suppressor protein BRCA1, and gut-enriched Krüppel-like factor (GKLF, KLF4). To date, no specific role has been attributed to the most proximal and overlapping GC boxes 5 and 6 (Ref. 29Gartel A.L. Radhakrishnan S.K. Cancer Res. 2005; 65: 3980-3985Crossref PubMed Scopus (701) Google Scholar and references therein). Together, these observations suggest that the specificity of utilizing different proximal GC-boxes under different p21 regulation conditions is important. From the analysis of amino acid sequences of all available human POZ-domain proteins, we identified a novel ZBTB5 POK protein with a POZ-domain and two unique zinc finger domains. We investigated whether ZBTB5 could regulate any components of the ARF-HDM2-p53-p21 pathway and examined the mechanisms and physiological consequences of ZBTB5 action. ZBTB5 repressed transcription of the p21 gene and significantly increased cell proliferation. Our data suggest that ZBTB5 may be an important transcription regulator of p21 and may play a critical role in regulating important biological processes controlled by p21. p21-Luc plasmid was kindly provided by Dr. Yoshihiro Sowa of the Kyoto Perpetual University of Medicine (Kyoto, Japan).

The pcDNA3-ZBTB5 plasmid was prepared by cloning a cDNA fragment (KIAA0354) into pcDNA3.0 (Invitrogen). The GAL4-POZZBTB5 plasmid was prepared by cloning a cDNA fragment (encoding amino acids 1–135) into a pCMX-Gal4 plasmid. To prepare recombinant GST-POZZBTB5 and GST-ZFZBTB5 proteins, cDNA fragments encoding the POZ domain (amino acids 1–123) and zinc fingers (amino acids 612–766) were cloned into pGEX4T3 (Amersham Biosciences). All plasmid constructs were verified by DNA sequencing. Antibodies against p21, p53, Sp1, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, FLAG tag, Ac-H3, Ac-H4, HDAC3, and SMRT were purchased from Upstate (Charlottesville, VA), Chemicon (Temecula, CA), Calbiochem, and Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Most of the chemical reagents were purchased from Sigma. HEK293A, HCT116 p53+/+, and CV-1 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified eagle medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen). Saos-2 cells were cultured in McCoy's 5A medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 15% fetal bovine serum. pGL2-ARF-Luc, pGL2-HDM2-Luc, pGL2-p53-Luc, pG13-Luc, pG5-5x(GC-box)-Luc, and various pGL2-p21-Luc promoter reporter fusion plasmids as well as pcDNA3-ZBTB5, pcDNA3.1-p53, and pCMV-LacZ in various combinations were transiently transfected into various cell lines (HEK293A, HCT116, Saos-2, and CV-1) using Lipofectamine Plus reagent (Invitrogen). After 24–36 h of incubation, cells were harvested and analyzed for luciferase activity. Reporter activity was normalized with contransfected β-galactosidase activity for transfection efficiency. Total RNA was isolated from HEK293A cells using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). cDNAs were synthesized using 5 μg of total RNA, random hexamer (10 pmol), and Superscript reverse transcriptase II (200 units) in 20 μl using a reverse transcription kit (Invitrogen). qPCR was performed using SYBR Green Master Mix (Applied Biosystems). The following qPCR oligonucleotide primers sets were used: ZBTB5 forward, 5′-CCACTAGTGACTGCAGGCTG-3′, ZBTB5 reverse, 5′-CCTGCATAGGCCTGACGAA-3′; p21 forward, 5′-AGGGGACAGCAGAGGAAG-3′, p21 reverse, 5′-GCGTTTGGAGTGGTAGAAATCTG-3′; GAPDH forward, 5′-CCCCTTCATTGACCTCAACTAC-3′; GAPDH reverse, 5′-TCTCGCTCCTGGAAGATGG-3′. To analyze ZBTB5 mRNA expression in FVB mouse, total RNA was isolated as described above from mouse brain, heart, liver, muscle, kidney, spleen, brown adipose tissues, and white adipose tissues, and RT-PCR was carried out using the following oligonucleotide primer sets: ZBTB5 mRNA forward, 5′-TTGCTGTTCACAGCTGCCAC-3′; reverse, 5′-TTAGCCTGCGGGCCTTCCAC-3′. Cells were harvested and lysed in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.25% sodium deoxycholic acid, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, Complete Mini-Protease mixture). Cell extracts (40 μg) were separated using 12% SDS-PAGE gel electrophoresis, transferred onto Immun-BlotTM polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Bio-Rad), and blocked with 5% skim milk (BD Biosciences). Blotted membranes were incubated with antibodies against FLAG tag (Sigma), glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (Chemicon), p21, p53, HDAC3, ZBTB5, and SMRT and then incubated with anti-mouse or rabbit secondary antibody conjugated with HRP (Vector Laboratories). Protein bands were visualized with ECL solution (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Four siRNA against ZBTB5 mRNA were designed and purchased from Dharmacon (Lafayette, CO): siZBTB5-1, 5′-AACUUUACU-3′ and 5′-AGUAAAGUUAU-3′; siZBTB5-2, 5′-AGCUCGCAA-3′ and 5′-UUGCGAGCUCC-3′; siZBTB5-3, 5′-UCCUCAUUU-3′ and 5′-AAAUGAGGACG-3′; siZBTB5-4, 5′-UAAUGGAUG-3′ and 5′-CAUCCAUUACA-3′. siRNA (200 pmol) was transfected into HEK293A cells using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). After transfection, the cells were harvested, total RNA was prepared, and RT-qPCR analysis of mRNA was performed as described above. HEK293A cells were transfected with increasing amounts of the ZBTB5 expression vector pcDNA3-FLAG-ZBTB5. The molecular interaction between ZBTB5 and p53 or Sp1 on the endogenous p21 promoter and histone modification at the p21 proximal promoter in the cells was analyzed by the standard qChIP assay protocol, as described elsewhere (20Jeon B.N.

Levels of ZBTB5 binding at p53RE-1, -2, and Sp1 binding GC-box 5/6 sites were analyzed by anti-FLAG antibody (Sigma), and levels of binding of endogenous Sp1 and p53 proteins were analyzed by polyclonal antibodies against p53, and Sp1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). As a negative control, qChIP assays, IgG was used. Quantitative PCR of chromatin immunoprecipitated DNA was carried out using the following oligonucleotide primer sets designed to amplify the upstream regulatory regions around p53 binding sites and the proximal promoter region of the p21 gene: p53RE-1 binding primers (bp, −2307 ∼ −1947), forward 5′-CTGTGGCTCTGATTGGCTTT-3′, reverse 5′-GGGTCTTTAGAGGTCTCCTGTCT-3′; p53RE-2 binding primers (bp, −1462 ∼ −1128), forward 5′-CCACAGCAGAGGAGAAAGAAG-3′, reverse 5′-GCTGCTCAGAGTCTGGAAATC-3′. p21 proximal promoter primers (bp −133 ∼ +30), forward 5′-GCGCTGGGCAGCCAGGAGCCT-3′, reverse 5′-CTGACTTCGGCAGCTGCTCAC-3′. To analyze histone H3 and H4 modification at the proximal promoter (bp, −131∼+100), forward 5′-GATCGGTACCGCGCTGGGCAGCCAGGAGCCT-3′, reverse 5′-TCGTCACCCGCGCACTTAGA-3′ primers were used. HEK293A cells (transfected with expression vector if necessary) were washed, pelleted, and resuspended in a lysis buffer supplemented with protease inhibitors (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100). Cell lysate was precleared, and the supernatant was incubated overnight with anti-ZBTB5 (or anti-p53, anti-Sp1 anti-Myc, anti-FLAG, anti-corepressor) antibody on a rotating platform at 4 °C followed by incubation with protein A-Sepharose Fast Flow beads. Beads were collected, washed, and resuspended in equal volumes of 5× SDS loading buffer. Immunoprecipitated proteins were separated with 12% SDS-PAGE. The Western blot assay was performed as described above using appropriate antibodies. CV-1 cells were co-transfected with pG5-Luc, pGal4-POZZBTB5, pVP16-corepressors, and pCMV-LacZ using Lipofectamine Plus (Invitrogen). After 36 h of transfection, cells were harvested and assayed for luciferase activity. Luciferase activity was then normalized with co-transfected β-galactosidase activity. Recombinant GST, GST-POZZBTB5, and GST-ZFZBTB5 fusion proteins were prepared from Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) grown for 4 h at 37 °C in medium containing 1 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. The E. coli were lysed and purified using glutathione-agarose 4 bead affinity chromatography (Peptron, Taejeon, Korea). The purified proteins were then resolved with 12% SDS-PAGE to quantitate and assess purity. Corepressor, p53, and Sp1 polypeptides were prepared by incubating 1 μg of pcDNA3-corepressor, pcDNA3.1-p53, or pcDNA3.1-Sp1 expression plasmid with TNT Quick-coupled Transcription/Translation Extract (Promega) containing 40 μl of TNT Quick Master Mix and 2 μl of [35S]methionine (1175.0 Ci/mol) (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) at 30 °C for 90 min. Polypeptide expression levels were then analyzed by running 1 μl of the total mixture through 12% SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. For GST fusion protein pulldown assays, GST fusion protein-agarose bead complexes were incubated with in vitro translated [35S]methionine-labeled corepressors, p53, and Sp1 polypeptides at 4 °C for 4 h in HEMG buffer (40 mm HEPES, 100 mm KCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol, 1.5 mm DTT, protease inhibitors). The reaction mixtures were centrifuged, pellets were rinsed, and the bound proteins were separated using 12% SDS-PAGE. Gels were then exposed to x-ray film using an image-intensifying screen (Eastman Kodak Co.). ZBTB5 cDNA was cloned into the adenovirus E1 shuttle vector pCA14 (Microbix; Ontario, Canada) to generate pCA14-ZBTB5. The pCA14-ZBTB5 shuttle vector was linearized by XmnI digestion, and the adenovirus vector vmdl324Bst (from Dr. Verca at the University of Fribourgh, Switzerland), containing the Ad5 genome deleted in the E1 and E3 region, was also linearized with BstBI digestion. The linearized pCA14-ZBTB5 and the vmdl324Bst digested with BstBI were co-transformed into E. coli BJ518 for homologous recombination. Proper homologous recombinant adenoviral plasmid was digested with PacI and transfected into HEK293 cells to generate adenovirus expressing ZBTB5 (dl324-ZBTB5).

https://openalex.org/W2023980761,"Villin and gelsolin consist of six homologous domains of the gelsolin/cofilin fold (V1-V6 and G1-G6, respectively). Villin differs from gelsolin in possessing at its C terminus an unrelated seventh domain, the villin headpiece. Here, we present the crystal structure of villin domain V6 in an environment in which intact villin would be inactive, in the absence of bound Ca(2+) or phosphorylation. The structure of V6 more closely resembles that of the activated form of G6, which contains one bound Ca(2+), rather than that of the calcium ion-free form of G6 within intact inactive gelsolin. Strikingly apparent is that the long helix in V6 is straight, as found in the activated form of G6, as opposed to the kinked version in inactive gelsolin. Molecular dynamics calculations suggest that the preferable conformation for this helix in the isolated G6 domain is also straight in the absence of Ca(2+) and other gelsolin domains. However, the G6 helix bends in intact calcium ion-free gelsolin to allow interaction with G2 and G4. We suggest that a similar situation exists in villin. Within the intact protein, a bent V6 helix, when triggered by Ca(2+), straightens and helps push apart adjacent domains to expose actin-binding sites within the protein. The sixth domain in this superfamily of proteins serves as a keystone that locks together a compact ensemble of domains in an inactive state. Perturbing the keystone initiates reorganization of the structure to reveal previously buried actin-binding sites."
https://openalex.org/W2067132453,"The catalytic α-subunits of Na,K- and H,K-ATPase require an accessory β-subunit for proper folding, maturation, and plasma membrane delivery but also for cation transport. To investigate the functional significance of the β-N terminus of the gastric H,K-ATPase in vivo, several N-terminally truncated β-variants were expressed in Xenopus oocytes, together with the S806C α-subunit variant. Upon labeling with the reporter fluorophore tetramethylrho da mine-6-maleimide, this construct can be used to determine the voltage-dependent distribution between E1P/E2P states. Whereas the E1P/E2P conformational equilibrium was unaffected for the shorter N-terminal deletions βΔ4 and βΔ8, we observed significant shifts toward E1P for the two larger deletions βΔ13 and βΔ29. Moreover, the reduced ΔF/F ratios of βΔ13 and βΔ29 indicated an increased reverse reaction via E2P → E1P + ADP → E1 + ATP, because cell surface expression was completely unaffected. This interpretation is supported by the reduced sensitivity of the mutants toward the E2P-specific inhibitor SCH28080, which becomes especially apparent at high concentrations (100 μm). Despite unaltered apparent Rb+ affinities, the maximal Rb+ uptake of these mutants was also significantly lowered. Considering the two putative interaction sites between the β-N terminus and α-subunit revealed by the recent cryo-EM structure, the N-terminal tail of the H,K-ATPase β-subunit may stabilize the pump in the E2P conformation, thereby increasing the efficiency of proton release against the million-fold proton gradient of the stomach lumen. Finally, we demonstrate that a similar truncation of the β-N terminus of the closely related Na,K-ATPase does not affect the E1P/E2P distribution or pump activity, indicating that the E2P-stabilizing effect by the β-N terminus is apparently a unique property of the H,K-ATPase.

The gastric H,K-ATPase fulfills the remarkable task of pumping protons against a more than 106-fold concentration gradient. H+ extrusion is coupled to countertransport of an equal number of K+ ions for each ATP molecule hydrolyzed, resulting in an electroneutral overall process (1Sachs G. Chang H.H. Rabon E. Schackman R. Lewin M. Saccomani G. J. Biol. Chem. 1976; 251: 7690-7698Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Characteristic for all P-type ATPases, the enzyme cycles between the two principal conformational states (E1 and E2) and the corresponding phosphointermediates (E1P and E2P), which are formed by reversible phosphorylation of an aspartate residue in the highly conserved DKTGTLT motif. According to a Post-Albers-like reaction scheme (see Fig. 1A), the conformational E1P → E2P transition converts the high H+/low K+ affinity of the cation binding pocket into a low H+/high K+ affinity binding site, hence enabling proton release into the stomach lumen and subsequent binding of extracellular K+. Because the pump faces a lumenal proton concentration of ∼150 mm (2Wallmark B. Lorentzon P. Sachs G. J. Intern. Med. Suppl. 1990; 732: 3-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar), proton release is probably the energetically most demanding step in the reaction cycle. Thus, during the conformational E1P → E2P transition, enormous pKa changes of the H+-coordinating residues have to occur that most likely involve the rearrangement of a positively charged lysine side chain (Lys-791 in rat H,K-ATPase) (3Sachs G.

Nakasako M. Nomura H. Ogawa H. Nature. 2000; 405: 647-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (1605) Google Scholar). However, a unique feature of K+-transporting Na,K- and H,K-ATPase enzymes is the requirement for an accessory β-subunit, which is indispensable for proper folding, maturation, and plasma membrane delivery (5McDonough A.A. Geering K. Farley R.A. FASEB J. 1990; 4: 1598-1605Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar, 6Gottardi C.J. Caplan M.J. J. Biol.

Despite only 20–30% overall sequence identity between the H,K-ATPase β-subunit and the Na,K β-isoforms, the topogenic structure is similar: a short N-terminal cytoplasmic tail, followed by a single transmembrane segment and a large extracellular C-terminal domain with glycosylation sites and disulfide-bridging cysteines. Numerous studies have demonstrated that the β-subunit of the Na,K-ATPase is more than just a chaperone for the α-subunit, being also required for proper ion transport activity of the holoenzyme. In fact, it has been discovered that different cell- and tissue-specific β-isoforms have distinct effects on the cation affinities (7Jaisser F. Jaunin P. Geering K. Rossier B.C. Horisberger J.D. J.

Far less is known about the functional significance of the single H,K-ATPase β-isoform, especially about its potential impact on cation transport (reviewed in Refs. 25Geering K. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 2001; 33: 425-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar and 26Chow D.C. Forte J.G. J. Exp. Biol. 1995; 198: 1-17Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We have proven recently that E2P state-specific transmembrane interactions between residues in αTM7 and two highly conserved tyrosines in the βTM of both Na,K- and H,K-ATPase significantly stabilize the E2P conformation (19Dürr K.L. Tavraz N.N. Dempski R.E. Bamberg E. Friedrich T. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 3842-3854Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Mutational disruptions of this interaction resulted in substantial shifts toward E1P and severely affected H+ secretion, which highlighted the physiological relevance of this E2P state stabilization. Notably, according to the recently published cryo-EM structure of pig gastric H,K-ATPase in the pseudo-E2P state (27Abe K. Tani K. Nishizawa T. Fujiyoshi Y. EMBO J. 2009; 28: 1637-1643Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), the N-terminal tail of the β-subunit makes direct contact with the phosphorylation domain of the α-subunit (see Fig. 1B), thus indicating an additional E2P state stabilization mediated by the β-N terminus. Although this idea was further supported by biochemical studies on N-terminally truncated mutants, direct evidence for this putative E2P-stabilizing interaction and its potential significance for ion transport in intact cells is still lacking. Here, we demonstrate for the first time the functional importance of the gastric H,K-ATPase β-subunit N terminus in living cells under in vivo conditions: voltage clamp fluorometry, Rb+ flux, and SCH28080 sensitivity measurements revealed E1P-shifted, ion transport-impaired phenotypes for two N-terminally truncated H,K β-variants, thus substantiating the E2P-stabilizing effect of the β-N terminus suggested by the recent cryo-EM structure. The cDNAs of the rat gastric H,K-ATPase β-subunit and a modified form of the α-subunit with a single cysteine replacement in the M5/M6 extracellular loop (S806C; Fig. 1B) were subcloned into vector pTLN (28Lorenz C. Pusch M. Jentsch T.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1996; 93: 13362-13366Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). This cysteine replacement enables environmentally sensitive TMRM labeling of gastric H,K-ATPase (29Geibel S. Zimmermann D. Zifarelli G. Becker A. Koenderink J.B. Hu Y.K. Kaplan J.H. Friedrich T.

Prior to experiments that were usually carried out 2 or 3 days after injection at 21–24 °C, the oocytes were preincubated in solutions containing 100 μm ouabain (Sigma-Aldrich) to inhibit the endogenous Xenopus Na,K-ATPase. Site-specific labeling of H,K (or Na,K)-ATPase-expressing oocytes was achieved by incubating oocytes in HK7.4 buffer (90 mm NaCl, 20 mm tetraethylammonium chloride, 5 mm BaCl2, 5 mm NiCl2, 10 mm MOPS/Tris, pH 7.4) containing 5 μm TMRM (Molecular Probes) for 5 min at room temperature in the dark, followed by extensive washes in dye-free HK7.4 buffer. Voltage clamp fluorometry measurements were carried out under high extracellular Na+/K+-free conditions for the characterization of H,K-ATPase mutants in HK5.5 buffer (90 mm NaCl, 20 mm tetraethylammonium chloride, 5 mm BaCl2, 5 mm NiCl2, 10 mm MES/Tris, pH 5.5, 100 μm ouabain) and for Na,K-ATPase-expressing oocytes in NaK7.4 buffer (100 mm NaCl, 5 mm BaCl2, 5 mm NiCl2, 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 100 μm ouabain), respectively. Details on setup components, data acquisition, and analysis are given in Ref. 19Dürr K.L. Tavraz N.N. Dempski R.E. Bamberg E. Friedrich T. J. Biol.

The oocytes were incubated for 15 min in Rb+ flux buffer (5 mm RbCl, 85 mm tetramethylammonium chloride, 20 mm tetraethylammonium chloride, 5 mm BaCl2, 5 mm NiCl2, 10 mm MES, pH 5.5, 100 μm ouabain). After three washing steps in Rb+-free washing buffer (90 mm tetramethylammonium chloride or NaCl, 20 mm tetraethylammonium chloride, 5 mm BaCl2, 5 mm NiCl2, 10 mm MES, pH 5.5) and one wash in water, each individual oocyte was homogenized in 1 ml of Millipore water. For SCH28080 inhibition experiments, the K+-competitive inhibitor SCH28080 (Sigma-Aldrich) was added to the preincubation solution and Rb+ flux buffer (to a final concentration of either 10 μm or 100 μm), respectively. To determine the apparent constant K0.5 for half-maximal activation of the H,K-ATPase by rubidium, the sum [tetramethylammonium chloride] plus [RbCl] in the Rb+ flux buffer was kept constant at 90 mm, e.g. 1 mm RbCl + 89 mm tetramethylammonium chloride. After subtraction of the average Rb+ uptake into control oocytes from the same batches at a given [RbCl], the data were fitted to a Michaelis-Menten type function (Equation 1). Aliquots of 20 μl from oocyte homogenates were analyzed by atomic absorption spectroscopy using an AAnalyst800TM spectrometer (PerkinElmer Life Sciences), equipped with a transversely heated graphite furnace using a temperature protocol according to the manufacturer's procedures (conditions available on request). Absorption was measured at 780 nm using a rubidium hollow cathode lamp (Photron, Melbourne, Australia). After Zeeman background correction, the Rb+ contents were calculated by comparison with standard calibration curves (measured between 0 and 50 μg/liter Rb+). The procedures for isolation of plasma membranes and total cellular membranes from Xenopus oocytes, gel electrophoresis, and immunoblotting were performed according to the protocols in Ref. 19Dürr K.L.

To investigate whether the N-terminal domain of the β-subunit indeed contributes to E2P state stabilization of the gastric H,K-ATPase, we expressed the wild type β-subunit and four N-terminally deleted H,K β-mutants (Fig. 2A) together with the α-subunit variant S806C in Xenopus oocytes. After site-specific labeling of this cysteine with TMRM (Fig. 1B), monoexponential fluorescence changes were observed upon voltage jumps from a holding potential of −40 mV to values between −180 and +60 mV (Fig. 2B). Hence, this mutant α-subunit directly monitors the voltage-dependent distribution between the E1P/E2P states of H,K-ATPase enzymes, as demonstrated previously (19Dürr K.L. Tavraz N.N. Dempski R.E. Bamberg E. Friedrich T. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 3842-3854Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 30Dürr K.L. Tavraz N.N. Zimmermann D. Bamberg E. Friedrich T. Biochemistry. 2008; 47: 4288-4297Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Fig. 2C shows the resulting voltage dependence of steady-state fluorescence amplitudes (1 − ΔF/F), which follow a Boltzmann-type distribution for both wild type and β-N-terminally deleted H,K-ATPase enzymes. Whereas these curves were not changed for the shorter N-terminal deletions βΔ4 and βΔ8 compared with βWT, the distributions for the βΔ13 and βΔ29 truncated variants were significantly shifted toward more positive potentials (see Table 1 for Boltzmann parameters), indicating a relative destabilization of the E2P state in favor of E1P. According to these distributions, ∼65% of the βWT and βΔ4- and βΔ8-containing H,K-ATPase molecules occur in the E2P state at −60 mV (which is the physiologically relevant membrane potential determined for parietal cells (34Demarest J.R. Machen T.E. Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 1985; 249: C535-C540Crossref Google Scholar)), but only 60 and 50% of the βΔ29 and βΔ13 mutant enzymes are present in E2P, respectively. Furthermore, the E1P shift is also reflected by the voltage-dependent reciprocal time constants obtained from monoexponential fits to the fluorescence changes (Fig. 2D); of note, these are significantly smaller for the βΔ29 and βΔ13 mutants than for the wild type only at positive potentials, which favor the forward reaction from E1P to E2P, but not at negative potentials, at which the enzyme is driven into the E1P state (via the backward reaction described by krev in Figs. 1A and 2D). Therefore, these N-terminal deletions apparently cause a shift toward E1P by reducing the “forward” rate constant (designated as kfw) of the E1P/E2P transition without changing the rate constant krev for the “reverse” reaction.TABLE 1Parameters from fits of a Boltzmann function to (1 − ΔF/F)/V distributions of N-terminally deleted H,K-ATPase β-mutants (Fig. 2C)Boltzmann parameter (1 − ΔF/F)/V curvesV0.5zqmVHKαS806C/βWT−110.1 ± 5.00.33 ± 0.01HKαS806C/βΔ4−115.3 ± 5.80.31 ± 0.01HKαS806C/βΔ8−108.7 ± 4.30.32 ± 0.02HKαS806C/βΔ13−56.3 ± 6.30.34 ± 0.02HKαS806C/βΔ29−89.9 ± 4.30.32 ± 0.01 Open table in a new tab However, if only the results shown in Fig. 2 (C and D) are considered, the conformational effect caused by the N-terminal deletions is probably underestimated because compared with βWT, the two variants βΔ13 and βΔ29 also showed substantially smaller values for the enzyme-specific fluorescence changes ΔF/F (Fig. 2E). Western blot analysis of isolated plasma membranes excluded the possibility that the lower ΔF/F values observed for the βΔ13 and βΔ29 constructs were simply due to a reduced cell surface delivery of the α-subunits that are available for labeling with TMRM (Fig. 2F and supplemental Fig. S1). Therefore, it is safe to assume that the shown ΔF/F ratio is directly proportional to the number of H,K-ATPase molecules that can be shifted between E1P/E2P states by voltage jumps (according to the reaction sequence highlighted in gray in Fig. 1A). The ∼2-fold lower ΔF/F values observed for the βΔ13 and βΔ29 mutants (compared with βWT, βΔ4, and βΔ8) most likely reflect a higher tendency of the mutant H,K-ATPase molecules (that accumulate in the E1P state because of the reduced kfw) to undergo further backward reactions via E1P (H+) → E1P + H+ + ADP → E1 + H+ + ATP. The resulting substantial depletion in the sum of E1P/E2P states would therefore explain the observed smaller fluorescence changes. This interpretation is actually in line with previous results from pulse-chase experiments on purified membranes of H,K-ATPase-expressing HEK293 cells. Compared with the wild type, the membrane fractions containing β-N-terminally truncated variant βΔ8, βΔ13 (27Abe K. Tani K. Nishizawa T. Fujiyoshi Y. EMBO J. 2009; 28: 1637-1643Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), or βΔ28 3K. Abe, unpublished results. showed increased reactivity of radiolabeled E132P-phosphoenzymes with ADP to form [γ-32P]ATP via the aforementioned reverse reaction. Of note, in these chase experiments, already the βΔ8 mutant exhibited a significantly reduced amount of 32P-phosphoenzyme after a 5-s chase with ADP. However, care has to be taken when comparing these and our voltage clamp fluorometry results because of the differences in experimental conditions. The pulse-chase experiments have been performed on membrane fractions at a ubiquitous pH of 6.4, lower ionic strength, and 0 °C, whereas voltage clamp fluorometry probes the enzyme within an intact membrane environment with physiological ion concentrations (and neutral intracellular pH) at room temperature. Differences in the intracellular ion concentration or pH may well affect intramolecular interactions, especially if these interactions involve potentially charged residues (amino acids 6–8 in the N-terminal sequence MAALQEKKSC…). Furthermore, the intracellular ATP and Mg2+ concentrations are by far higher in Xenopus oocytes than in the pulse-chase experiments (2.3 mm ATP (35Gribble F.M. Loussouarn G. Tucker S.J. Zhao C. Nichols C.G. Ashcroft F.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 30046-30049Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar), 0.5 mm Mg2+ versus 10 μm ATP, 20 μm Mg2+), thus favoring the forward phosphorylation reaction. Therefore, small effects on the E1P/E2P distribution that would reflect enhanced ADP-dependent dephosphorylation of the E1P state of the βΔ8 mutant are possibly obscured under the conditions in living cells. To assess the impact on ion transport activity potentially caused by the conformational shifts of the N-terminally truncated β-variants, we determined Rb+ uptake at saturating extracellular concentrations. Whereas Rb+ uptake for βΔ4- and βΔ8-expressing oocytes was comparable with βWT, it was ∼20% lower for βΔ13 and βΔ29 (Fig. 3A and Table 2). This can be interpreted as a reduced turnover number (lowered vmax) because the apparent affinity for extracellular Rb+ was unaffected by the truncations (see Fig. 3B and Table 2 for apparent K0.5 values). The affected turnover numbers of the βΔ13 and βΔ29 mutants demonstrate that obviously the transition that is characterized by the reduced rate constant kfw of these variants directly affects the rate-limiting step of the catalytic cycle. This illustrates how already small shifts in conformational equilibria can have significant functional consequences for the transport activity of the gastric H,K-ATPase.TABLE 2Rb+ uptake activity, SCH28080 sensitivity, and apparent Rb+ affinity of N-terminally deleted H,K-ATPase β-mutants (Fig. 3)Normalized Rb+ uptake activity (5 mm RbCl)aThe values are the means ± S.E. of 40–50 oocytes from three or four different oocyte batches.,bThe data were normalized to Rb+ uptake of HKαS806C/βWT, corresponding to 32 pmol/min/oocyte.Residual Rb+ uptake activity in presence of SCH28080aThe values are the means ± S.E. of 40–50 oocytes from three or four different oocyte batches.,cThe data were normalized to Rb+ uptake at 5 mm RbCl in the absence of SCH28080 for each construct after subtraction of the mean Rb+ uptake of uninjected oocytes.Apparent Rb+ affinity (K0.5)dThe values are the means ± S.E. of 10–20 oocytes.10 μm SCH28080100 μm SCH28080%%mmHKαS806C/βWT100 ± 3.921 ± 2.06 ± 0.70.66 ± 0.09HKαS806C/βΔ496 ± 3.321 ± 1.714 ± 1.80.62 ± 0.14HKαS806C/βΔ895 ± 4.418 ± 2.013 ± 2.30.70 ± 0.18HKαS806C/βΔ1377 ± 4.028 ± 2.325 ± 2.60.65 ± 0.12HKαS806C/βΔ2983 ± 3.827 ± 2.220 ± 1.70.52 ± 0.10Uninjected4 ± 0.4a The values are the means ± S.E. of 40–50 oocytes from three or four different oocyte batches.b The data were normalized to Rb+ uptake of HKαS806C/βWT, corresponding to 32 pmol/min/oocyte.c The data were normalized to Rb+ uptake at 5 mm RbCl in the absence of SCH28080 for each construct after subtraction of the mean Rb+ uptake of uninjected oocytes.d The values are the means ± S.E. of 10–20 oocytes. Open table in a new tab In the presence of 10 μm SCH28080, an E2P-specific inhibitor of the H,K-ATPase (36Wallmark B. Sachs G. Mardh S. Fellenius E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1983; 728: 31-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 37Mendlein J. Sachs G. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 5030-5036Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 38Keeling D.J. Taylor A.G. Schudt C. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 5545-5551Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the Rb+ uptake of βWT-, βΔ4-, and βΔ8-expressing oocytes was reduced to ∼20% (Fig. 3A, inset, and Table 2), in agreement with the data of Mathews et al. (39Mathews P.M. Claeys D. Jaisser F. Geering K. Horisberger J.D. Kraehenbuhl J.P. Rossier B.C. Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 1995; 268: C1207-C1214Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, the inhibition of ATPase complexes containing βΔ13 and βΔ29 was less efficient, resulting in significantly higher residual activities of ∼30% at 10 μm SCH28080. Notably, 100 μm SCH28080 resulted in a suppression of Rb+ uptake to ∼6% residual activity for HKαS806C/βWT, whereas the effect was much smaller for any of the N-terminally deleted β-variants. As a possible consequence of the E1P-shifted phenotypes of the mutants, the mean dwell time of molecules in the SCH28080-sensitive E2P state may be substantially shorter. Thus, increasing the inhibitor concentration would not result in enhanced binding of the compound because the dwell time in E2P is not sufficient to reach binding equilibrium under turnover conditions. In contrast, the wild type H,K-ATPase, which stays longer in E2P, is able to bind more inhibitor molecules if the SCH28080 concentration is increased. Interestingly, at the higher inhibitor concentration, a significantly reduced SCH28080 sensitivity was also observed for βΔ4- and βΔ8-expressing oocytes, which showed a more than 2-fold higher residual activity compared with βWT (13–14% versus 6%). This suggests that already the shorter deletions cause an elevated preference for E1P, which raises the question of why no effect on the conformational distribution (Fig. 2C) was seen for these constructs. Two possibilities may account for this: (i) minute shifts in the voltage-dependent E1P/E2P distribution may be difficult to resolve by voltage clamp fluorometry experiments because low slope factors zq of the Boltzmann curves limit the accuracy of V0.5 determination, and (ii) E2-destabilizing effects that act on the relative distribution of pump molecules over all reaction intermediates may not be effective during the partial reaction sequence studied in pre-steady-state experiments (voltage clamp fluorometry) but rather become apparent under steady-state conditions (Rb+ uptake), in which the enzyme undergoes the full reaction cycle. Although the reduction in Rb+ transport activity of βΔ13 and βΔ29 truncated mutants appears moderate, it is important to note that these subtle effects were observed already at a relatively mild proton gradient (pHint ∼ 7.4 versus pHext = 5.5). However, in vivo the H,K-ATPase pumps protons against a 10,000-fold higher gradient of ∼106. Under these physiological conditions (which are unfortunately not applicable to Xenopus oocytes), the high lumenal H+ concentration would even more favor H+ reverse binding at the extracellular sites, thereby also stimulating the E2P → E1P “backward” reaction (i.e. increasing krev). An enhanced krev in addition to the reduced forward rate constant kfw (as observed for the N-terminally deleted mutants βΔ13 and βΔ29) is thus expected to have even more drastic effects on the turnover number. Therefore, although causing only small effects at the rather shallow pH gradient applied here, the E2P state destabilization by the β-N-terminal truncations will almost certainly slow down H+ secretion under the pH conditions in the stomach. A surprising finding from the current study is that the more extensive deletion βΔ29 caused a smaller shift toward the E1P state than βΔ13 (Fig. 2C and Table 1). The two putative interaction sites between the β-N terminus and the α-subunit proposed by the recently published cryo-EM structure of the pig gastric H,K-ATPase (27Abe K. Tani K. Nishizawa T. Fujiyoshi Y. EMBO J. 2009; 28: 1637-1643Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) may provide a rationale to explain these rather unexpected effects; apart from the aforementioned contact between the β-N terminus and the P-domain (probably near Arg-716 to Ala-719; see red arrow in Fig. 1B), a stretch of the β-N terminus located closer to the transmembrane domain also approaches the cytoplasmic stalk of αTM3, which is connected to the A-domain (Fig. 1B, black arrow). Therefore, truncation of the first 12 amino acids in βΔ13 may only disrupt the interaction with the P-domain and thereby cause the strong E1P shift, whereas the more extensive deletion in βΔ29 most likely affects both critical contacts, which might involve an additional compensatory mechanism (see below). As outlined by Abe et al. (27Abe K. Tani K. Nishizawa T. Fujiyoshi Y. EMBO J. 2009; 28: 1637-1643Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), the contact between the β-subunit N terminus and the P-domain probably stabilizes the enzyme in E2P, thereby minimizing the reverse reaction with ADP via E2P → E1P + ADP → E1 + ATP in terms of a “ratchet”-like mechanism. In the pseudo-E2P state revealed by the cryo-EM structure, the nucleotide-binding domain of the α-subunit is retracted far from the P-domain (supplemental Fig. S2). Therefore, reverse transfer of the phosphate (bound to Asp-385 in the P-domain) to ADP (bound to the nucleotide-binding domain) would require a large movement of the P-domain, which is presumably prohibited by the tethering between the P-domain and β-N terminus in the E2 state. In contrast, in a putative E1P state derived from a SERCA-E1AlF4-ADP structure (40Toyoshima C. Nomura H. Tsuda T. Nature. 2004; 432: 361-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar), the ADP at the nucleotide-binding domain is in close proximity to the phosphate analogue AlF4− (shown in supplemental Fig. S2), which could thus explain the enhanced ADP rephosphorylation of the E1P-shifted N-terminally deleted β-variants (27Abe K. Tani K. Nishizawa T. Fujiyoshi Y. EMBO J. 2009; 28: 1637-1643Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The interaction of the β-N terminus with the A-domain via the movement of αTM3 may also be functionally significant because the protrusion of the TGES loop from the A-domain into the gap between the N- and P-domains may have a segregating effect, too (supplemental Fig. S2). Although the influence of the β-N/αTM3 contact on positioning of the A-domain is not resolved yet, it seems possible that the missing contact to the β-N terminus via αTM3 (in βΔ29) may lead to unrestricted movement of the A-domain. This may promote the segregating effect of the TGES loop, which could partially compensate for the destabilization of E2P that arises from the missing interaction with the P-domain, thus explaining the less E1P-shifted phenotype of βΔ29 compared with βΔ13. Notably, according to the recently published crystal structure of the closely related Na,K-ATPase in the Rb+-occluded E2 state (41Morth J.P. Pedersen B.P. Toustrup-Jensen M.S. Sørensen T.L. Petersen J. Andersen J.P. Vilsen B. Nissen P. Nature. 2007; 450: 1043-1049Crossref PubMed Scopus (692) Google Scholar), there is no indication for similar interactions between the β-N terminus and the α-subunit of the sodium pump. Although the β-N terminus of the Na,K-ATPase was not completely resolved in this structure so that evidence for a similar interaction in the Na,K-ATPase is absent so far, we tried to explore whether the intersubunit interaction mediated by the H,K-ATPase β-N terminus is conserved among P2C-type ATPases. To determine the impact of β-N-terminal truncation on sheep Na,K-ATPase, the eight most N-terminal amino acids of reporter construct β1S62C (24Dempski R.E. Friedrich T. Bamberg E. J. Gen. Physiol. 2005; 125: 505-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) of the β1-subunit were deleted (Fig. 4A). Because the cytoplasmic β-N terminus of the Na,K-ATPase is shorter than that of the gastric H,K-ATPase, this truncation results in a N-terminal domain comparable in length to the βΔ13 variant of the H,K-ATPase. This N-terminally truncated β-variant, NaKβ1S62CΔ8, was coexpressed with the wild type sheep α1-subunit, labeled by TMRM, and subjected to voltage jumps in a K+-free solution containing 100 mm Na+. The resulting voltage-dependent distribution of fluorescence amplitudes is not significantly different from the one observed for full-length β1S62C-containing Na,K-ATPase complexes (Fig. 4B and Table 3). Furthermore, as inferred from the stationary pump currents at 10 mm K+, the ion transport activity of the Na,K-ATPase is completely unaffected by the β-N-terminal truncation (Fig. 4B, inset). Regarding the comparably shallow Na+ gradient under physiological conditions, an analogous ratchet-like E2P stabilization is probably not necessary to assist Na+ transport of the sodium pump. This further supports our hypothesis that the E2P state stabilization mediated by the H,K-ATPase β-N terminus is unique to facilitate proton transport against the steep proton gradient across the parietal cell membrane, which is ∼10,000-fold higher than the typical transmembrane gradient for Na+ ions. Therefore, the mechanism of E2P state stabilization by the gastric H,K-ATPase β-N terminus appears to be a distinctive property of this enzyme.TABLE 3Stationary pump currents and parameters from fits of a Boltzmann function to (1 − ΔF/F)/V distributions of β-N-terminally truncated Na,K-ATPase (Fig. 4)Boltzmann parameter (1 − ΔF/F)/V curvesStationary pump currents at 10 mm KClV0.5zqmVnANaKα1WT/β1S62C−92.7 ± 7.70.70 ± 0.03221 ± 85NaKα1WT/β1S62CΔ8−100.8 ± 7.50.68 ± 0.03232 ± 38 Open table in a new tab As a key observation, the recently published cryo-EM structure of the gastric H,K-ATPase highlighted the close proximity between the P-domain of the α-subunit and the short N-terminal tail of the β-subunit, suggesting an E2P-stabilizing interaction of the two subunits. The current study on N-terminally truncated β-variants provides direct evidence that the β-N terminus assists in E2P state stabilization and that this is critical for the transport efficiency of the enzyme under in vivo conditions. Because the effects of the mutants were already significant under the relatively shallow H+ gradient (ΔpH ≈2), they may even be more relevant for the enzyme in situ, where a strong E2P preference is essential for efficient H+ release against a ΔpH of ∼6 units. Moreover, because we recently demonstrated an E2P-stabilizing effect of interactions between residues in the transmembrane domain of the H,K-ATPase β-subunit and TM7 of the α-subunit, the two effects exerted by different regions of the β-subunit may synergistically contribute to the functional requirement of E2P state stabilization."

In the viral productive cycle, the EBV genome is amplified more than 100-fold utilizing viral replication machinery consisting of the BZLF1 protein, an oriLyt-binding protein; the BALF5 protein, a DNA polymerase (Pol); the BMRF1 protein, a Pol processivity factor; the BALF2 protein, a single-stranded DNA-binding protein; and the BBLF4, BSLF1, and BBLF2/3 proteins, which are predicted to be helicase, primase, and helicase-primase-associated proteins, respectively (5Fixman E.D. Hayward G.S. Hayward S.D. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 2998-3006Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It has been suggested that all except the BZLF1 protein work together at replication forks to synthesize leading and lagging strands of the concatemeric EBV genome (6Tsurumi T. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 2001; 258: 65-87PubMed Google Scholar). Epstein-Barr virus BZLF1-responsive element 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate amino acid(s) nucleotide(s) electrophoretic mobility shift assay polymerase hypotonic buffer 2-[bis(2-hydroxyethyl)amino]-2-(hydroxymethyl)propane-1,3-diol immunoprecipitation bacterial artificial chromosome. The EBV BALF2 gene encodes a single-stranded DNA-binding protein that is indispensable for the lytic phase of EBV DNA replication (5Fixman E.D. Hayward G.S. Hayward S.D. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 2998-3006Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7Decaussin G. Leclerc V. Ooka T. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 7309-7314Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). BALF2 protein is abundantly expressed in cells undergoing lytic replication and preferentially binds to single-stranded DNA rather than to double-stranded DNA or single-stranded RNA, thereby enhancing the DNA synthesis catalyzed by the BALF5 Pol catalytic subunit and yielding replication products with longer length (8Tsurumi T. Kobayashi A. Tamai K. Yamada H. Daikoku T. Yamashita Y. Nishiyama Y. Virology. 1996; 222: 352-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Stoichiometrically large amounts of the BALF2 protein are required at viral replication forks during the lytic phase of EBV DNA replication. It has been reported that the gene promoter is activated transcriptionally by both BZLF1 and BRLF1 proteins (9Hung C.H. Liu S.T. J. Gen. Virol. 1999; 80: 2747-2750Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Whether an additional mechanism contributes to augmented expression of the BALF2 gene remains to be clarified. The BMRF1 gene product, which is also called early antigen diffused, is essential for processive DNA synthesis by the BALF5 polymerase catalytic subunit and is the major early phosphoprotein for EBV lytic replication (10Chen L.W. Lin L.S. Chang Y.S. Liu S.T. Virology. 1995; 211: 593-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 11Chiou J.F. Li J.K. Cheng Y.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Virol. 1993; 67: 7648-7653Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The BMRF1 protein shows homogenous, not dotlike, distribution throughout the replication compartments, completely coincident with the newly synthesized viral genome (20Daikoku T. Kudoh A. Fujita M. Sugaya Y. Isomura H. Shirata N. Tsurumi T. J. Virol. 2005; 79: 3409-3418Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The immunostaining data together with the findings that almost all of abundantly expressed BMRF1 proteins bind to DNA (20Daikoku T. Kudoh A. Fujita M. Sugaya Y. Isomura H. Shirata N. Tsurumi T. J. Virol. 2005; 79: 3409-3418Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) indicate that it not only acts at viral replication forks as a polymerase processive factor but it also is widely distributed on newly synthesized EBV genomic DNA. Recently it has been shown to transcriptionally activate the EBV BHLF1 promoter, one of two divergent early promoters located within the lytic origin of viral DNA replication, oriLyt (21Zhang Q. Hong Y. Dorsky D. Holley-Guthrie E. Zalani S. Elshiekh N.A. Kiehl A. Le T. Kenney S. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 5131-5142Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 22Zhang Q. Holley-Guthrie E. Ge J.Q. Dorsky D.

Virol. 1999; 80: 69-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), as well as transactivating a cellular gastrin promoter (24Holley-Guthrie E.A. Seaman W.T. Bhende P. Merchant J.L. Kenney S.C. J. Virol. 2005; 79: 745-755Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Interaction between BMRF1 protein and promoter-bound cellular transcriptional factors, such as ZBP-89 and/or SP1, appears to be essential for formation of initial transcriptional replication complexes to enhance transcription (24Holley-Guthrie E.A. Seaman W.T. Bhende P. Merchant J.L. Kenney S.C. J. Virol. 2005; 79: 745-755Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 25Baumann M. Feederle R. Kremmer E. Hammerschmidt W. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6095-6105Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). In the present study, we found that the BMRF1 protein evidently enhances BZLF1-mediated transcriptional activation of the BALF2 promoter. At least two BZLF1-binding sites, termed BZLF1-responsive element (ZREs), were identified within the BALF2 promoter region, and BZLF1 binding to the BALF2 promoter proved necessary for the BMRF1 augmentation of BALF2 promoter activity. A monomeric BMRF1 mutant, C95E, also enhanced the BZLF1-mediated transcriptional activation of the BALF2 promoter to an extent similar to that of wild-type BMRF1. However, phosphorylation of the BMRF1 protein by the EBV protein kinase prevented the enhancement, indicating that hypophosphorylated forms are functional to the augmentation of the BALF2 promoter activity. When HEK293 cells harboring the EBV genome but lacking BMRF1 and BALF5 genes were treated with chemical compounds to induce BALF2 gene expression, exogenous BMRF1 significantly augmented its expression, demonstrating functions as a transcriptional regulator in the context of viral lytic replication. This is the first report that the BMRF1 protein acts as a transcriptional coactivator for the BZLF1 protein. The B95-8 B lymphoblastoid cell line was maintained in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2. HEK293 and HEK293T cells were grown and maintained in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (Sigma) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. For induction of lytic replication in B95-8 cells, 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) at a final concentration of 100 ng/ml, 5 mm sodium n-butyrate, and 0.5 μg/ml calcium ionophore (A23187) were added to the culture medium, and then the cells were incubated for 48 h. The BZLF1 protein expression vector (pBZLF1) was kindly provided by Dr. K. Kuzushima (Aichi Cancer Center Research Institute, Nagoya, Japan). The expression vectors for wild-type BGLF4 and for kinase-dead mutant K102I possessing a mutation at the catalytic lysine were constructed as described in our recent published report (26Murata T. Isomura H. Yamashita Y. Toyama S. Sato Y. Nakayama S. Kudoh A. Iwahori S. Kanda T. Tsurumi T. Virology. 2009; 389: 75-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Coding regions of the BRLF1 and BMRF1 genes were amplified by PCR using B95-8 genomic DNA as the template and inserted into EcoRI-HindIII sites of pcDNA3.1(+) (Invitrogen) to generate pBRLF1 and pBMRF1, respectively. A carboxyl-terminal FLAG-tagged BMRF1 expression vector (pWT-f) was obtained by subcloning a PCR-amplified insert using primers containing the FLAG tag sequence. BMRF1 deletion mutants were obtained by PCR using pWT-f as a template. The pBMRF1(C95E) point mutant was generated by site-directed mutagenesis replacing Cys-95 with glutamic acid. The quadruple mutant pBMRF1(S337A/T344V/S349A/T355V) (27Yang P.W. Chang S.S. Tsai C.H. Chao Y.H. Chen M.R. J. Gen. Virol. 2008; 89: 884-895Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) was generated by stepwise site-directed mutagenesis. For construction of BZLF1-E2 fusion protein expression vector (pBZLF1:E2), a PCR-amplified fragment containing the E2 DNA binding region sequence (nt 652–1232) was inserted into the XbaI-XhoI site of a mutated pBZLF1 whose stop codon was eliminated by inserting an XbaI site by site-directed mutagenesis. Bovine papillomavirus type-1 E2 DNA used as a template for the PCR was kindly provided by Dr. T. Kiyono (National Cancer Center Research Institute, Tokyo, Japan). This allowed generation of the plasmid pBZLF1:E2 expressing a chimeric protein consisting of amino acids (aa) 1–245 of BZLF1 and aa 128–410 of E2. Carboxyl-terminal FLAG-tagged E2 DNA binding region (aa 128–410) (pE2-FLAG) was obtained by subcloning a PCR-amplified insert using primers containing the FLAG sequence. The BALF2 promoter region (nt −358 to +12) (9Hung C.H. Liu S.T. J. Gen. Virol. 1999; 80: 2747-2750Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) was subcloned into the pGL4.10 (Promega) reporter plasmid containing luciferase gene (luc2). The B95-8 genomic DNA was used as a template for the PCR. The PCR products were double digested with NheI and HindIII and then subcloned into pGL4.10. The resultant plasmid was designated pBALF2P. A reporter vector with a truncated BALF2 promoter was generated by amplifying each length of the promoter and subcloning into the NheI and HindIII sites of pGL4.10. To construct reporter plasmids, pE2-BA2P1, in which the putative ZRE1 was replaced with the E2-binding sites (5′-ACCGTTTTCGGT-3′) (28McBride A.A. Byrne J.C. Howley P.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1989; 86: 510-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar), site-directed mutagenesis was carried out twice. Other mutant reporters, pE2-BA2P2 and pE2-BA2P3, were generated likewise. Oligonucleotide primers and DNA templates used for PCR or site-directed mutagenesis to construct expression vectors or reporter genes are specified in supplemental Tables 1 and 2. The inserted DNA sequence of each vector was confirmed by DNA sequencing. All transfections were in triplicate on 24-well plates of HEK293 cells using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. In all experiments, 10 ng of the pCMV-Rluc plasmid were co-transfected as an internal control. The amount of transfected DNA was kept constant by adding empty vector. Luciferase activity was measured with a Dual-Luciferase assay kit (Promega) according to the manufacturer’s instructions using a luminometer (Berthold). Transfected HEK293 cells were suspended in Passive Lysis Buffer (Promega), incubated for 15 min at room temperature, and then vortexed for 10 s. The proteins were separated by 10% SDS-PAGE and transferred onto Immobilon transfer membranes (Millipore) followed by detection using Western Lightning (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Images were processed with LumiVision PRO 400EX (Aisin/Taitec, Inc.). An anti-BMRF1-specific mouse monoclonal antibody, R3, and an anti-glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase were purchased from Chemicon International Inc. An anti-BRLF1-specific mouse antibody and an anti-FLAG-specific mouse monoclonal antibody, M2, were purchased from Argen Inc. and Sigma, respectively. Affinity-purified anti-BALF2-, anti-BZLF1-, and anti-BMRF1-specific polyclonal antibodies were prepared as described previously (8Tsurumi T. Kobayashi A. Tamai K. Yamada H. Daikoku T. Yamashita Y. Nishiyama Y. Virology. 1996; 222: 352-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 20Daikoku T. Kudoh A. Fujita M. Sugaya Y. Isomura H. Shirata N. Tsurumi T. J.

Virol. 1999; 80: 2879-2887Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The anti-BGLF4 antibody was kindly provided by Dr. Kawaguchi (Tokyo University) (30Kato K. Yokoyama A. Tohya Y. Akashi H. Nishiyama Y. Kawaguchi Y. J. Gen. Virol. 2003; 84: 3381-3392Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). EBV BZLF1 protein was purified from Sf21 cells infected with recombinant baculovirus expressing BZLF1 protein (31Yokoyama N. Hirata M. Ohtsuka K. Nishiyama Y. Fujii K. Fujita M. Kuzushima K. Kiyono T. Tsurumi T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1493: 119-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Sf21 cells were infected with recombinant baculovirus. Cells were harvested 72 h postinfection and suspended in hypotonic buffer (HB; 40 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.6), 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml pepstatin) followed by homogenization using a Dounce homogenizer. Nuclei were then centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 20 min, resuspended in 0.1 m NaCl, HB containing 0.2% Triton X-100, and precipitated again. After one more washing with 0.1 m NaCl, HB containing 0.2% Triton X-100, precipitates were washed with 0.2 m NaCl, HB containing 0.2% Triton X-100 twice, and then BZLF1 protein was extracted with 0.6 m NaCl, HB containing 0.2% Triton X-100. Purity of the protein was greater than 90%. The DNA sequences of each oligonucleotide probe were as follows: B2ZRE1 (containing from nt −137 to −114), 5′-CAGTTGAGACGTCAGTTCCCCGTGACGT-3′ (sense) and 5′-ACGTACGTCACGGGGAACTGACGTCTCA-3′ (antisense); B2ZRE2 (containing from nt −80 to −57), 5′-CAGTCTTTGTAAATGAATAAACAGTGGG-3′ (sense) and 5′-ACGTCCCACTGTTTATTCATTTACAAAG-3′ (antisense); 2×E2 (containing two concatenated E2 binding sequences), 5′-CAGTACCGTTTTCGGTACCGTTTTCGGT-3′ (sense) and 5′-ACGTACCGAAAACGGTACCGAAAACGGT-3′ (antisense); ZRE5 (containing ZRE5 sequence derived from oriLyt), 5′-GTCGTAATAACCCCGCCCCGTTGAC-3′ (sense) and 5′-ACGTACCGAAAACGGTACCGAAAACGGT-3′ (antisense). Equal molar ratios of each pair of sense and antisense oligonucleotides were mixed, denatured at 95 °C, and annealed by cooling gradually to room temperature. 32P-Labeled probes were prepared by 3′-end labeling using the Klenow fragment of Escherichia coli DNA polymerase I and [32P]dCTP (Amersham Biosciences). Unincorporated deoxynucleotide triphosphates were removed with Chromaspin-10 columns (Clontech). Binding reactions were performed at room temperature with 50 ng of purified BZLF1 protein in a buffer consisting of 20 mm HEPES-KOH (pH 7.6), 100 mm KCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.25 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.5 μg of poly(dI-dC)-poly(dI-dC). After adding 1 ng of the labeled probe and 20 ng (×20) or 100 ng (×100) of the cold probe as a competitor, the mixture was incubated for 30 min. The sample was then loaded onto a 5% polyacrylamide gel and run in 0.5× Tris borate-EDTA buffer. Gels were dried and used to expose Fuji imaging plates for analysis by a Fuji Image Analyzer BAS 2500. Cell lysates were prepared using a NativePAGE Sample Prep kit (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. A precast 4–16% NuPAGE Bis-Tris gel (Invitrogen) was used to resolve the protein. NativeMark standard (Invitrogen) was used as a molecular weight standard. Each of the expression plasmids for carboxyl-terminal FLAG-tagged BMRF1 wild type and mutants or BZLF1 protein were individually transfected into HEK293T cells. At 48 h post-transfection cells were lysed in 500 μl of a lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 0.5 mm EDTA) supplemented with 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 mm NaF, 2 mm Na3VO4, and protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science) and then sonicated followed by centrifugation at 18,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. The protein extract containing each BMRF1 protein (100 μg) and the BZLF1 cell extract (100 μg) were mixed and then applied for immunoprecipitation using 40 μl of anti-FLAG M2 affinity gel (Sigma) with gentle rocking overnight at 4 °C. Immunocomplexes were collected by centrifugation and washed five times with wash buffer (20 mm HEPES-KOH (pH 7.6), 75 mm KCl, 25 mm MgCl2, 0.15% Nonidet P-40, 0.1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol). The immunoprecipitates were then subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblot analysis with the anti-BZLF1-specific antibody. B95-8 cells were treated with TPA, A23187, and sodium butyrate to induce lytic replication; harvested 48 h post-treatment; and lysed in IP buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.6), 1 mm EDTA, 0.2% Nonidet P-40, 10 mm NaF, 2 mm Na3VO4, protease inhibitor mixture) containing 500 mm NaCl. After incubation for 10 min on ice, cells were sonicated followed by centrifugation at 18,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. The supernatants were diluted 5-fold with IP buffer, precleaned with Dynabeads protein A (Dynal), and mixed with anti-BZLF1-specific rabbit IgG or normal rabbit IgG for 2 h at 4 °C. After the addition of Dynabeads protein A, the mixtures were further incubated for 1 h at 4 °C. The beads were then washed five times with IP buffer containing 100 mm NaCl. The immunoprecipitates were then subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblot analysis with the anti-BMRF1-specific mouse monoclonal antibody. BAC DNA of human EBV B95-8 (B95-8/F-BAC) was provided by Hammerschmidt and co-workers (32Delecluse H.J. Hilsendegen T. Pich D. Zeidler R. Hammerschmidt W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1998; 95: 8245-8250Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar). Homologous recombination was carried out in E. coli as described previously (33Isomura H. Tsurumi T. Stinski M.F. J. Virol. 2004; 78: 12788-12799Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 34Isomura H. Stinski M.F. Kudoh A. Murata T. Nakayama S. Sato Y. Iwahori S. Tsurumi T. J. Virol. 2008; 82: 1638-1646Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). To generate a deletion mutant BAC of BMRF1 gene, linear targeting constructs for recombination were prepared by PCR. To construct EBV BACΔM/neo containing a kanamycin resistance gene and streptomycin sensitivity gene, RpsLneo (purchased from Gene Bridges, Dresden, Germany) was used as a PCR template. A pair of oligonucleotides was designed to carry oligonucleotide homologous to the target region of B95-8/F-BAC at their 5′-ends and oligonucleotide homologous to the template at their 3′-ends. The following oligonucleotide pair was used: BM1neoF, 5′-GTAAACCTTCTGTCTGTAAACTATGGAGGCCCCCGGCTGGCCGCCGTGGCCAACGCAGGCggcctggtgatgatggcgggatc-3′; and BM1neoR, 5′-TTGTTGGAGTCCTGTGCCCAGTGGTTGCACCCGGGGACTTTTATCTTCTGGCtcagaggctcagaagaactcgtcaagaagg-3′. Uppercase and lowercase letters indicate regions homologous to BMRF1 gene of B95-8/F-BAC and RpsLneo plasmid, respectively. The PCR products were digested with DpnI to remove residual template DNA. Approximately 200 ng of the linear PCR product was electroporated into recombinase-induced E. coli DH10B electrocompetent cells (harboring pREDE5 and EBV BAC), which were prepared as described previously (3Hammerschmidt W. Sugden B. Cell. 1988; 55: 427-433Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). Electrotransformation was performed using a Bio-Rad Gene Pulser II electroporation system (0.1-cm cuvette, 1.6 kV, 25 microfarads, 200 ohms, 50 μl of cells). Colonies of recombinant BAC DNA were identified by plating cells on an LB plate containing chloramphenicol (30 μg/ml) and kanamycin (30 μg/ml). To construct EBV BACΔM by removing the marker gene from EBV BACΔM/neo, double-stranded DNAs for recombination were prepared by two-step PCR. Two oligonucleotides (BMovF and BMovR) were designed to carry oligonucleotide homologous to 5′-ends and 3′-ends of the outside of the region deleting BMRF1 gene. Another pair of primers was designed upstream and downstream of the region deleting BMRF1 gene. The following primers were used: BMovF, 5′-GCTGCTTGTGgagccagaagataaaagtccc-3′; BMovR, 5′-ATCTTCTGGCTCcacaagcagcagcagaagc-3′; BMupF1, 5′-GAGGGGGTTACCTTGGTGGATGTG-3′; and BMRF1R, 5′-TTAAATGAGGGGGTTAAAGGCCTG-3′. First PCRs were performed using pairs of primers (BMupF1 and BMovR or BMovF and BMRF1R) and B95-8/F-BAC as a template. A second PCR was performed using a pair of primers (BMupF1 and BMRF1R) and the first PCR products as a template. Approximately 200 ng of the resultant PCR product was electroporated into recombinase-induced E. coli HS996 electrocompetent cells (harboring pREDE5 and EBV BACΔM/neo). Colonies of recombinant BAC DNA were identified by plating cells on an LB plates containing chloramphenicol and streptomycin. To generate a double deletion mutant BAC of BMRF1 and BALF5 genes, EBV BACΔMΔPol, double-stranded DNAs for recombination were prepared by PCR as described above. The following primers were used: BA5neoF, 5′-ACGGCAAGGCCGGAGGCAGACACCCACGGAAGCCCTCTGGACTTCCATGTCTACGACATAggcctggtgatgatggcgggatc-3′; and BA5neoR, 5′-GGCTCCGGGTGGTGTGGGCGGCCAGGGCATCGGCAAAGCGCAGGGTCTCGCTCTCTGAAAtcagaagaactcgtcaagaagg-3′. Approximately 200 ng of the linear PCR product was electroporated into recombinase-induced HS996 electrocompetent cells (harboring pREDE5 and EBV BACΔM). Colonies of recombinant BAC DNA were identified by plating cells on an LB plate containing chloramphenicol and kanamycin. Obtained BAC DNAs were analyzed by 0.6% agarose gel electrophoresis after digestion with BamHI restriction enzyme, and sequences near the deletion regions were confirmed by DNA sequencing. HEK293 cells (5 × 105) were transfected with 1–3 μg of BAC DNA using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). The next day, transfected cells were reseeded on a culture plate in medium containing 150 μg/ml hygromycin. After 2 weeks, hygromycin-resistant clones were screened for the presence of BAC DNA. When EBV lytic replication was induced in B95-8 cells with chemical compounds, viral early proteins, such as BALF2 or BMRF1, appeared at 12 h postinduction and reached plateaus at around 24 h (Fig. 1). The BALF2 gene product was so abundantly expressed that its protein band (130 kDa) was visible when the cell lysate was analyzed by gel electrophoresis and Coomassie Blue staining (data not shown). The BALF2 protein binds to single-stranded DNA and facilitates movement of the EBV DNA polymerase stoichiometrically at viral replication forks (5Fixman E.D. Hayward G.S. Hayward S.D. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 2998-3006Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7Decaussin G. Leclerc V. Ooka T. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 7309-7314Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8Tsurumi T. Kobayashi A. Tamai K. Yamada H. Daikoku T. Yamashita Y. Nishiyama Y. Virology. 1996; 222: 352-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The exceptional high level expression of the BALF2 protein prompted us to clarify the molecular mechanism of regulation of the BALF2 gene promoter. To clarify molecular mechanisms governing BALF2 gene expression, transient reporter assays were used. We constructed a reporter plasmid, pBALF2P, by inserting the promoter sequence between −358 and +12 of the BALF2 gene into the pGL4.10 luciferase reporter vector (see Fig. 3A). Transient expression of either the BZLF1 protein alone (Fig. 2A, lane 2) or the BRLF1 protein alone (Fig. 2B, lane 5) transactivated the BALF2 promoter as reported previously (9Hung C.H. Liu S.T. J. Gen. Virol. 1999; 80: 2747-2750Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 35Chang P.J. Chang Y.S. Liu S.T. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 5128-5136Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).FIGURE 2BMRF1 enhances BZLF1-dependent transcriptional activation from the BALF2 promoter. A, luciferase assays using the BALF2 promoter-reporter plasmid pBALF2P were performed. Increasing amounts of pBMRF1 (0, 100, 200, and 400 ng) were co-transfected into HEK293 cells with 10 ng of pBZLF1 and 100 ng of pBALF2P for the luciferase assay. B, BMRF1 enhances BZLF1-dependent transcription from the BALF2 promoter but not BRLF1-dependent transcription. pBMRF1 (400 ng) was co-transfected with pBZLF1 (10 ng), pBRLF1 (15 ng), or both as indicated, and cells were then subjected to luciferase assay at 48 h post-transfection. In all experiments, 10 ng of the pCMV-Rluc plasmid were co-transfected as an internal control. Bars represent mean -fold activation of the luciferase activity obtained by transfecting the empty vector with pBALF2P ±S.E. from three independent experiments. The -fold activations by transfection of pBMRF plasmid (compared with that without pBMRF1) are given in the graphs. Expression levels of BZLF1, BMRF1, and B"

Considering a system without enzymes, in which the tRNAs (the translation adaptors) are not loaded selectively with amino acids, we show that an elementary translation governed by a Michaelis-Menten type of kinetics can follow different polymerization regimes: random polymerization, homopolymerization and coded polymerization. The regime under which the system is running is set by the relative concentrations of the amino acids and the kinetic constants involved. We point out that the coding regime can naturally occur under prebiotic conditions. It generates partially coded proteins through a mechanism which is remarkably robust against non-specific interactions (mismatches) between the adaptors and the RNA template. Features of the genetic code support the existence of this early translation system."
https://openalex.org/W2138040591,"Eukaryote cells are suggested to arise somewhere between 0.85~2.7 billion years ago. However, in the present world of unicellular organisms, cells that derive their food and metabolic energy from larger cells engulfing smaller cells (phagocytosis) are almost exclusively eukaryotic. Combining these propositions, that eukaryotes were the first phagocytotic predators and that they arose only 0.85~2.7 billion years ago, leads to an unexpected prediction of a long period (approximately 1-3 billion years) with no phagocytotes -- a veritable Garden of Eden.We test whether such a long period is reasonable by simulating a population of very simple unicellular organisms -- given only basic physical, biological and ecological principles. Under a wide range of initial conditions, cellular specialization occurs early in evolution; we find a range of cell types from small specialized primary producers to larger opportunistic or specialized predators.Both strategies, specialized smaller cells and phagocytotic larger cells are apparently fundamental biological strategies that are expected to arise early in cellular evolution. Such early predators could have been 'prokaryotes', but if the earliest cells on the eukaryote lineage were predators then this explains most of their characteristic features."
https://openalex.org/W1969174828,"Several pathways have been postulated to explain the evolution of warning coloration, which is a perplexing phenomenon. Many of these attempt to circumvent the problem of naïve predators by inferring kin selection or neophobia. Through a stochastic model, we show that a secreted secondary defence chemical can provide selective pressure, on the individual level, towards developing warning coloration. Our fundamental assumption is that increased conspicuousness will result in longer assessment periods and divergence from the predators' searching image, thus reducing the probability of a predator making mistakes. We conclude that strong olfactory signaling by means of chemical secretions can lead to the evolution of warning coloration."
https://openalex.org/W2015373383,"Background Voltage-gated Cav1.2 calcium channels play a crucial role in Ca2+ signaling. The pore-forming α1C subunit is regulated by accessory Cavβ subunits, cytoplasmic proteins of various size encoded by four different genes (Cavβ1 - β4) and expressed in a tissue-specific manner. Methods and Results Here we investigated the effect of three major Cavβ types, β1b, β2d and β3, on the structure of Cav1.2 in the plasma membrane of live cells. Total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy showed that the tendency of Cav1.2 to form clusters depends on the type of the Cavβ subunit present. The highest density of Cav1.2 clusters in the plasma membrane and the smallest cluster size were observed with neuronal/cardiac β1b present. Cav1.2 channels containing β3, the predominant Cavβ subunit of vascular smooth muscle cells, were organized in a significantly smaller number of larger clusters. The inter- and intramolecular distances between α1C and Cavβ in the plasma membrane of live cells were measured by three-color FRET microscopy. The results confirm that the proximity of Cav1.2 channels in the plasma membrane depends on the Cavβ type. The presence of different Cavβ subunits does not result in significant differences in the intramolecular distance between the termini of α1C, but significantly affects the distance between the termini of neighbor α1C subunits, which varies from 67 Å with β1b to 79 Å with β3. Conclusions Thus, our results show that the structural organization of Cav1.2 channels in the plasma membrane depends on the type of Cavβ subunits present."
https://openalex.org/W2049313232,Differentiation of erythroid cells is regulated by cell signaling pathways including those that change the intracellular concentration of calcium. Calcium-dependent proteases have been shown previously to process and regulate the activity of specific transcription factors. We show here that the protein levels of upstream stimulatory factor (USF) increase during differentiation of murine erythroleukemia (MEL) cells. USF was subject to degradation by the Ca(2+)-dependent protease m-calpain in undifferentiated but not in differentiated MEL cells. Treatment of MEL cells with the specific calpain inhibitor calpeptin increased the levels of USF and strongly induced expression of the adult alpha- and beta-globin genes. The induction of globin gene expression was associated with an increase in the association of USF and RNA po ly mer ase II with regulatory elements of the beta-globin gene locus. Calpeptin also induced high level alpha- and beta-globin gene expression in primary CD71-positive erythroid progenitor cells. The combined data suggest that inhibition of calpain activity is required for erythroid differentiation-associated increase in globin gene expression.
