https://openalex.org/W1990286385,"Metabolites in the kynurenine pathway, generated by tryptophan degradation, are thought to play an important role in neurodegenerative disorders, including Alzheimer's and Huntington's diseases. In these disorders, glutamate receptor-mediated excitotoxicity and free radical formation have been correlated with decreased levels of the neuroprotective metabolite kynurenic acid. Here, we describe the synthesis and characterization of JM6, a small-molecule prodrug inhibitor of kynurenine 3-monooxygenase (KMO). Chronic oral administration of JM6 inhibits KMO in the blood, increasing kynurenic acid levels and reducing extracellular glutamate in the brain. In a transgenic mouse model of Alzheimer's disease, JM6 prevents spatial memory deficits, anxiety-related behavior, and synaptic loss. JM6 also extends life span, prevents synaptic loss, and decreases microglial activation in a mouse model of Huntington's disease. These findings support a critical link between tryptophan metabolism in the blood and neurodegeneration, and they provide a foundation for treatment of neurodegenerative diseases."
https://openalex.org/W1969570431,"Background Because of the central functions of the mitochondria in providing metabolic energy and initiating apoptosis on one hand and the role that microRNA (miRNA) play in gene expression, we hypothesized that some miRNA could be present in the mitochondria for post-transcriptomic regulation by RNA interference. We intend to identify miRNA localized in the mitochondria isolated from human skeletal primary muscular cells. Methodology/Principal Findings To investigate the potential origin of mitochondrial miRNA, we in-silico searched for microRNA candidates in the mtDNA. Twenty five human pre-miRNA and 33 miRNA aligments (E-value<0.1) were found in the reference mitochondrial sequence and some of the best candidates were chosen for a co-localization test. In situ hybridization of pre-mir-302a, pre-let-7b and mir-365, using specific labelled locked nucleic acids and confocal microscopy, demonstrated that these miRNA were localized in mitochondria of human myoblasts. Total RNA was extracted from enriched mitochondria isolated by an immunomagnetic method from a culture of human myotubes. The detection of 742 human miRNA (miRBase) were monitored by RT-qPCR at three increasing mtRNA inputs. Forty six miRNA were significantly expressed (2nd derivative method Cp>35) for the smallest RNA input concentration and 204 miRNA for the maximum RNA input concentration. In silico analysis predicted 80 putative miRNA target sites in the mitochondrial genome (E-value<0.05). Conclusions/Significance The present study experimentally demonstrated for the first time the presence of pre-miRNA and miRNA in the human mitochondria isolated from skeletal muscular cells. A set of miRNA were significantly detected in mitochondria fraction. The origin of these pre-miRNA and miRNA should be further investigate to determine if they are imported from the cytosol and/or if they are partially processed in the mitochondria."

https://openalex.org/W2132741811,"Although volumetric and activation changes in the cerebellum have frequently been reported in studies on major depression, its role in the neural mechanism of depression remains unclear. To understand how the cerebellum may relate to affective and cognitive dysfunction in depression, we investigated the resting-state functional connectivity between cerebellar regions and the cerebral cortex in samples of patients with geriatric depression (n = 11) and healthy controls (n = 18). Seed-based connectivity analyses were conducted using seeds from cerebellum regions previously identified as being involved in the executive, default-mode, affective-limbic, and motor networks. The results revealed that, compared with controls, individuals with depression show reduced functional connectivity between several cerebellum seed regions, specifically those in the executive and affective-limbic networks with the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) and increased functional connectivity between the motor-related cerebellum seed regions with the putamen and motor cortex. We further investigated whether the altered functional connectivity in depressed patients was associated with cognitive function and severity of depression. A positive correlation was found between the Crus II–vmPFC connectivity and performance on the Hopkins Verbal Learning Test-Revised delayed memory recall. Additionally, the vermis–posterior cinglate cortex (PCC) connectivity was positively correlated with depression severity. Our results suggest that cerebellum–vmPFC coupling may be related to cognitive function whereas cerebellum–PCC coupling may be related to emotion processing in geriatric depression."
https://openalex.org/W2079894465,"Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) infects lung macrophages, which instead of killing the pathogen can be manipulated by the bacilli, creating an environment suitable for intracellular replication and spread to adjacent cells. The role of host cell death during Mtb infection is debated because the bacilli have been shown to be both anti-apoptotic, keeping the host cell alive to avoid the antimicrobial effects of apoptosis, and pro-necrotic, killing the host macrophage to allow infection of neighboring cells. Since mycobacteria activate the NLRP3 inflammasome in macrophages, we investigated whether Mtb could induce one of the recently described inflammasome-linked cell death modes pyroptosis and pyronecrosis. These are mediated through caspase-1 and cathepsin-B, respectively. Human monocyte-derived macrophages were infected with virulent (H37Rv) Mtb at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 1 or 10. The higher MOI resulted in strongly enhanced release of IL-1β, while a low MOI gave no IL-1β response. The infected macrophages were collected and cell viability in terms of the integrity of DNA, mitochondria and the plasma membrane was determined. We found that infection with H37Rv at MOI 10, but not MOI 1, over two days led to extensive DNA fragmentation, loss of mitochondrial membrane potential, loss of plasma membrane integrity, and HMGB1 release. Although we observed plasma membrane permeabilization and IL-1β release from infected cells, the cell death induced by Mtb was not dependent on caspase-1 or cathepsin B. It was, however, dependent on mycobacterial expression of ESAT-6. We conclude that as virulent Mtb reaches a threshold number of bacilli inside the human macrophage, ESAT-6-dependent necrosis occurs, activating caspase-1 in the process."
https://openalex.org/W2096103960,"Cu(II) ions are implicated in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer disease by influencing the aggregation of the amyloid-β (Aβ) peptide. Elucidating the underlying Cu(II)-induced Aβ aggregation is paramount for understanding the role of Cu(II) in the pathology of Alzheimer disease. The aim of this study was to characterize the qualitative and quantitative influence of Cu(II) on the extracellular aggregation mechanism and aggregate morphology of Aβ(1-40) using spectroscopic, microelectrophoretic, mass spectrometric, and ultrastructural techniques. We found that the Cu(II):Aβ ratio in solution has a major influence on (i) the aggregation kinetics/mechanism of Aβ, because three different kinetic scenarios were observed depending on the Cu(II):Aβ ratio, (ii) the metal:peptide stoichiometry in the aggregates, which increased to 1.4 at supra-equimolar Cu(II):Aβ ratio; and (iii) the morphology of the aggregates, which shifted from fibrillar to non-fibrillar at increasing Cu(II):Aβ ratios. We observed dynamic morphological changes of the aggregates, and that the formation of spherical aggregates appeared to be a common morphological end point independent on the Cu(II) concentration. Experiments with Aβ(1-42) were compatible with the conclusions for Aβ(1-40) even though the low solubility of Aβ(1-42) precluded examination under the same conditions as for the Aβ(1-40). Experiments with Aβ(1-16) and Aβ(1-28) showed that other parts than the Cu(II)-binding His residues were important for Cu(II)-induced Aβ aggregation. Based on this study we propose three mechanistic models for the Cu(II)-induced aggregation of Aβ(1-40) depending on the Cu(II):Aβ ratio, and identify key reaction steps that may be feasible targets for preventing Cu(II)-associated aggregation or toxicity in Alzheimer disease."
https://openalex.org/W1975673887,"Methicillin-resistant coagulase-negative staphylococci (MR-CoNS) are opportunistic pathogens and serve as a large reservoir of staphylococcal cassette chromosome mec (SCCmec). Characterization of SCCmec in MR-CoNS can generate useful information on the mobilization and evolution of this element.Non-repetitive MR-CoNS clinical isolates (n = 84; 39 S. epidermidis, 19 S. haemolyticus, 9 S. hominis, 6 S. capitis, 4 S. warneri, 2 S. cohnii, 2 S. saprophyticus, 1 S. kloosii, 1 S. simulans and 1 S. massiliensis) were collected. All isolates could grow on plates with 4 mg/L cefoxitin and all had mecA as detected by PCR. Strain typing using RAPD and ERIC-PCR revealed that almost all isolates were of different strains. SCCmec typing was performed using multiplex PCR published previously. For isolates in which SCCmec could not be typed, the mec complex classes were determined by additional PCR and the ccr genes were amplified with published or newly-designed primers and then sequenced. SCCmec types were assigned for 63 isolates by multiplex PCR and were assigned for 14 other isolates by PCR targeting mec and ccr. Among 77 isolates with determined SCCmec types, 54 had a single type, including type III (n = 19), IV (n = 14), V (n = 10), II (n = 2), I (n = 1), VIII (n = 1) and five unnamed types (n = 7), while 23 isolates had two types, III+V (n = 12), II+V (n = 8), II+IV (n = 2) or IV+V (n = 1). The five unnamed types were assigned UT1 (class A mec, ccrA1/ccrB4), UT2 (class C1 mec, ccrA4/ccrB4), UT3 (class A mec, ccrA5/ccrB3), UT4 (class C2 mec, ccrA2/ccrB2 plus ccrC1) and UT5 (class A mec, ccrA1/ccrB1 plus ccrC1).SCCmec types III, IV and V were prevalent in MR-CoNS and many isolates could harbor more than one type. Several new types of SCCmec were identified, highlighting the great genetic diversity and the need of developing classification schemes for SCCmec in MR-CoNS."
https://openalex.org/W2117465360,"Drosophila ovarian follicles complete development using a spatially and temporally controlled maturation process in which they resume meiosis and secrete a multi-layered, protective eggshell before undergoing arrest and/or ovulation. Microarray analysis revealed more than 150 genes that are expressed in a stage-specific manner during the last 24 hours of follicle development. These include all 30 previously known eggshell genes, as well as 19 new candidate chorion genes and 100 other genes likely to participate in maturation. Mutations in pxt, encoding a putative Drosophila cyclooxygenase, cause many transcripts to begin expression prematurely, and are associated with eggshell defects. Somatic activity of Pxt is required, as RNAi knockdown of pxt in the follicle cells recapitulates both the temporal expression and eggshell defects. One of the temporally regulated genes, cyp18a1, which encodes a cytochromome P450 protein mediating ecdysone turnover, is downregulated in pxt mutant follicles, and cyp18a1 mutation itself alters eggshell gene expression. These studies further define the molecular program of Drosophila follicle maturation and support the idea that it is coordinated by lipid and steroid hormonal signals."
https://openalex.org/W2093328341,"Our goals were to (1) validate the parental Ages and Stages Questionnaires (ASQ) as a screening tool for psychomotor development among a cohort of ex-premature infants reaching 2 years, and (2) analyse the influence of parental socio-economic status and maternal education on the efficacy of the questionnaire. A regional population of 703 very preterm infants (<35 weeks gestational age) born between 2003 and 2006 were evaluated at 2 years by their parents who completed the ASQ, by a pediatric clinical examination, and by the revised Brunet Lezine psychometric test with establishment of a DQ score. Detailed information regarding parental socio-economic status was available for 419 infants. At 2 years corrected age, 630 infants (89.6%) had an optimal neuromotor examination. Overall ASQ scores for predicting a DQ score ≤85 produced an area under the receiver operator curve value of 0.85 (95% Confidence Interval:0.82–0.87). An ASQ cut-off score of ≤220 had optimal discriminatory power for identifying a DQ score ≤85 with a sensitivity of 0.85 (95%CI:0.75–0.91), a specificity of 0.72 (95%CI:0.69–0.75), a positive likelihood ratio of 3, and a negative likelihood ratio of 0.21. The median value for ASQ was not significantly associated with socio-economic level or maternal education. ASQ is an easy and reliable tool regardless of the socio-economic status of the family to predict normal neurologic outcome in ex-premature infants at 2 years of age. ASQ may be beneficial with a low-cost impact to some follow-up programs, and helps to establish a genuine sense of parental involvement."
https://openalex.org/W2029234026,"Recent studies have linked expression of lectin-like ox-LDL receptor 1 (OLR1) to tumorigenesis. We analyzed microarray data from Olr1 knockout (KO) and wild type (WT) mice for genes involved in cellular transformation and evaluated effects of OLR1 over-expression in normal mammary epithelial cells (MCF10A) and breast cancer cells (HCC1143) in terms of gene expression, migration, adhesion and transendothelial migration. Twenty-six out of 238 genes were inhibited in tissues of OLR1 KO mice; the vast majority of OLR1 sensitive genes contained NF-κB binding sites in their promoters. Further studies revealed broad inhibition of NF-kB target genes outside of the transformation-associated gene pool, with enrichment themes of defense response, immune response, apoptosis, proliferation, and wound healing. Transcriptome of Olr1 KO mice also revealed inhibition of de novo lipogenesis, rate-limiting enzymes fatty acid synthase (Fasn), stearoyl-CoA desaturase (Scd1) and ELOVL family member 6 (Elovl6), as well as lipolytic phospholipase A2 group IVB (Pla2g4b). In studies comparing MCF10A and HCC1143, the latter displayed 60% higher OLR1 expression. Forced over-expression of OLR1 resulted in upregulation of NF-κB (p65) and its target pro-oncogenes involved in inhibition of apoptosis (BCL2, BCL2A1, TNFAIP3) and regulation of cell cycle (CCND2) in both cell lines. Basal expression of FASN, SCD1 and PLA2G4B, as well as lipogenesis transcription factors PPARA, SREBF2 and CREM, was higher in HCC1143 cells. Over-expression of OLR1 in HCC1143 cells also enhanced cell migration, without affecting their adherence to TNFα-activated endothelium or transendothelial migration. On the other hand, OLR1 neutralizing antibody inhibited both adhesion and transmigration of untreated HCC1143 cells. We conclude that OLR1 may act as an oncogene by activation of NF-kB target genes responsible for proliferation, migration and inhibition of apoptosis and de novo lipogenesis genes."
https://openalex.org/W2084479815,"Chloroplast DNA sequences are of great interest for population genetics and phylogenetic studies. However, only a small set of markers are commonly used. Most of them have been designed for amplification in a large range of Angiosperms and are located in the Large Single Copy (LSC). Here we developed a new set of 100 primer pairs optimized for amplification in Monocotyledons. Primer pairs amplify coding (exon) and non-coding regions (intron and intergenic spacer). They span the different chloroplast regions: 72 are located in the LSC, 13 in the Small Single Copy (SSC) and 15 in the Inverted Repeat region (IR). Amplification and sequencing were tested in 13 species of Monocotyledons: Dioscorea abyssinica, D. praehensilis, D. rotundata, D. dumetorum, D. bulbifera, Trichopus sempervirens (Dioscoreaceae), Phoenix canariensis, P. dactylifera, Astrocaryum scopatum, A. murumuru, Ceroxylon echinulatum (Arecaceae), Digitaria excilis and Pennisetum glaucum (Poaceae). The diversity found in Dioscorea, Digitaria and Pennisetum mainly corresponded to Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP) while the diversity found in Arecaceae also comprises Variable Number Tandem Repeat (VNTR). We observed that the most variable loci (rps15-ycf1, rpl32-ccsA, ndhF-rpl32, ndhG-ndhI and ccsA) are located in the SSC. Through the analysis of the genetic structure of a wild-cultivated species complex in Dioscorea, we demonstrated that this new set of primers is of great interest for population genetics and we anticipate that it will also be useful for phylogeny and bar-coding studies."
https://openalex.org/W2116469093,"Here we describe a toolkit for the production of fluorescently tagged proteins in the C. elegans germline and early embryo using Mos1-mediated single copy insertion (MosSCI) transformation. We have generated promoter and 3′UTR fusions to sequences of different fluorescent proteins yielding constructs for germline expression that are compatible with MosSCI MultiSite Gateway vectors. These vectors allow tagged transgene constructs to be inserted as single copies into known sites in the C. elegans genome using MosSCI. We also show that two C. elegans heat shock promoters (Phsp-16.2 and Phsp-16.41) can be used to induce transgene expression in the germline when inserted via MosSCI transformation. This flexible set of new vectors, available to the research community in a plasmid repository, should facilitate research focused on the C. elegans germline and early embryo."
https://openalex.org/W2089545670,"Background p21WAF1/CIP1 is a well known cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor induced by various stress stimuli. Depending on the stress applied, p21 upregulation can either promote apoptosis or prevent against apoptotic injury. The stress-mediated induction of p21 involves not only its transcriptional activation but also its posttranscriptional regulation, mainly through stabilization of p21 mRNA levels. We have previously reported that the proteasome inhibitor MG132 induces the stabilization of p21 mRNA, which correlates with the formation of cytoplasmic RNA stress granules. The mechanism underlying p21 mRNA stabilization, however, remains unknown. Methodology/Principal Findings We identified the stress granules component CUGBP1 as a factor required for p21 mRNA stabilization following treatment with bortezomib ( = PS-341/Velcade). This peptide boronate inhibitor of the 26S proteasome is very efficient for the treatment of myelomas and other hematological tumors. However, solid tumors are sometimes refractory to bortezomib treatment. We found that depleting CUGBP1 in cancer cells prevents bortezomib-mediated p21 upregulation. FISH experiments combined to mRNA stability assays show that this effect is largely due to a mistargeting of p21 mRNA in stress granules leading to its degradation. Altering the expression of p21 itself, either by depleting CUGBP1 or p21, promotes bortezomib-mediated apoptosis. Conclusions/Significance We propose that one key mechanism by which apoptosis is inhibited upon treatment with chemotherapeutic drugs might involve upregulation of the p21 protein through CUGBP1."
https://openalex.org/W2010947186,"The oxidation and toxicity of dopamine is believed to contribute to the selective neurodegeneration associated with Parkinson disease. The formation of reactive radicals and quinones greatly contributes to dopaminergic toxicity through a variety of mechanisms. The physiological metabolism of dopamine to 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetaldehyde (DOPAL) via monoamine oxidase significantly increases its toxicity. To more adequately explain this enhanced toxicity, we hypothesized that DOPAL is capable of forming radical and quinone species upon oxidation. Here, two unique oxidation products of DOPAL are identified. Several different oxidation methods gave rise to a transient DOPAL semiquinone radical, which was characterized by electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy. NMR identified the second oxidation product of DOPAL as the ortho-quinone. Also, carbonyl hydration of DOPAL in aqueous media was evident via NMR. Interestingly, the DOPAL quinone exists exclusively in the hydrated form. Furthermore, the enzymatic and chemical oxidation of DOPAL greatly enhance protein cross-linking, whereas auto-oxidation results in the production of superoxide. Also, DOPAL was shown to be susceptible to oxidation by cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2). The involvement of this physiologically relevant enzyme in both oxidative stress and Parkinson disease underscores the potential importance of DOPAL in the pathogenesis of this condition."
https://openalex.org/W1972560989,"Microbial surface components recognizing adhesive matrix molecules (MSCRAMMs) are bacterial surface proteins mediating adherence of the microbes to components of the extracellular matrix of the host. On Staphylococci, the MSCRAMMs often have multiple ligands. Consequently, we hypothesized that the Staphylococcus aureus MSCRAMM bone sialoprotein-binding protein (Bbp) might recognize host molecules other than the identified bone protein. A ligand screen revealed that Bbp binds human fibrinogen (Fg) but not Fg from other mammals. We have characterized the interaction between Bbp and Fg. The binding site for Bbp was mapped to residues 561-575 in the Fg Aα chain using recombinant Fg chains and truncation mutants in Far Western blots and solid-phase binding assays. Surface plasmon resonance was used to determine the affinity of Bbp for Fg. The interaction of Bbp with Fg peptides corresponding to the mapped residues was further characterized using isothermal titration calorimetry. In addition, Bbp expressed on the surface of bacteria mediated adherence to immobilized Fg Aα. Also, Bbp interferes with thrombin-induced Fg coagulation. Together these data demonstrate that human Fg is a ligand for Bbp and that Bbp can manipulate the biology of the Fg ligand in the host."
https://openalex.org/W2075508190,"Cytochrome c (cyt c) release upon oxidation of cardiolipin (CL) in the mitochondrial inner membrane (IM) under oxidative stress occurs early in the intrinsic apoptotic pathway. We postulated that CL oxidation mobilizes not only cyt c but also CL itself in the form of hydroperoxide (CLOOH) species. Relatively hydrophilic CLOOHs could assist in apoptotic signaling by translocating to the outer membrane (OM), thus promoting recruitment of the pro-apoptotic proteins truncated Bid (tBid) and Bax for generation of cyt c-traversable pores. Initial testing of these possibilities showed that CLOOH-containing liposomes were permeabilized more readily by tBid plus Ca2+ than CL-containing counterparts. Moreover, CLOOH translocated more rapidly from IM-mimetic to OM-mimetic liposomes than CL and permitted more extensive OM permeabilization. We found that tBid bound more avidly to CLOOH-containing membranes than to CL counterparts, and binding increased with increasing CLOOH content. Permeabilization of CLOOH-containing liposomes in the presence of tBid could be triggered by monomeric Bax, consistent with tBid/Bax cooperation in pore formation. Using CL-null mitochondria from a yeast mutant, we found that tBid binding and cyt c release were dramatically enhanced by transfer acquisition of CLOOH. Additionally, we observed a pre-apoptotic IM-to-OM transfer of oxidized CL in cardiomyocytes treated with the Complex III blocker, antimycin A.

https://openalex.org/W1995404168,"Cilia and flagella are complex structures emanating from the surface of most eukaroytic cells and serve important functions including motility, signaling, and sensory reception. A process called intraflagellar transport (IFT) is of central importance to ciliary assembly and maintenance. The IFT complex is required for this transport and consists of two distinct multisubunit subcomplexes, IFT-A and IFT-B. Despite the importance of the IFT complex, little is known about its overall architecture. This paper presents a biochemical dissection of the molecular interactions within the IFT-B core complex. Two stable subcomplexes consisting of IFT88/70/52/46 and IFT81/74/27/25 were recombinantly co-expressed and purified. We identify a novel interaction between IFT70/52 and map the interaction domains between IFT52 and the other subunits within the IFT88/70/52/46 complex. Additionally, we show that IFT52 binds directly to the IFT81/74/27/25 complex, indicating that it could mediate the interaction between the two subcomplexes. Our data lead to an improved architectural map for the IFT-B core complex with new interactions as well as domain resolution mapping for several subunits."
https://openalex.org/W2034743595,"Conjugation is the main mode of horizontal gene transfer that spreads antibiotic resistance among bacteria. Strategies for inhibiting conjugation may be useful for preserving the effectiveness of antibiotics and preventing the emergence of bacterial strains with multiple resistances. Filamentous bacteriophages were first observed to inhibit conjugation several decades ago. Here we investigate the mechanism of inhibition and find that the primary effect on conjugation is occlusion of the conjugative pilus by phage particles. This interaction is mediated primarily by phage coat protein g3p, and exogenous addition of the soluble fragment of g3p inhibited conjugation at low nanomolar concentrations. Our data are quantitatively consistent with a simple model in which association between the pili and phage particles or g3p prevents transmission of an F plasmid encoding tetracycline resistance. We also observe a decrease in the donor ability of infected cells, which is quantitatively consistent with a reduction in pili elaboration. Since many antibiotic-resistance factors confer susceptibility to phage infection through expression of conjugative pili (the receptor for filamentous phage), these results suggest that phage may be a source of soluble proteins that slow the spread of antibiotic resistance genes."
https://openalex.org/W1981797437,"Heparin, which has been used as an anticoagulant drug for decades, inhibits angiogenesis, whereas thrombin promotes tumor-associated angiogenesis. However, the mechanisms underlying the regulation of angiogenesis by heparin and thrombin are not well understood. Here, we show that microRNA-10b (miR-10b) is down-regulated by heparin and up-regulated by thrombin in human microvascular endothelial cells (HMEC-1). Overexpression of miR-10b induces HMEC-1 cell migration, tube formation, and angiogenesis, and down-regulates homeobox D10 (HoxD10) expression via direct binding of miR-10b to the putative 3′ UTR of HoxD10. In addition, HMEC-1 cell migration and tube formation are induced by HoxD10 knockdown, whereas angiogenesis is arrested when HoxD10 expression is increased after anti-miR-10b or heparin treatments. Furthermore, expression of miR-10b and its transcription factor Twist are up-regulated by thrombin, whereas HoxD10 expression is impaired by thrombin. Using quartz crystal microbalance analysis, we show that heparin binds to thrombin, thereby inhibiting thrombin-induced expression of Twist and miR-10b. However, the expression of miR-10b is not attenuated by heparin any more after thrombin expression is silenced by its siRNA.

https://openalex.org/W1995896257,"RNA interference (RNAi), an RNA-dependent gene silencing process that is initiated by double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) molecules, has been applied with variable success in lepidopteran insects, in contrast to the high efficiency achieved in the coleopteran Tribolium castaneum. To gain insight into the factors that determine the efficiency of RNAi, a survey was carried out to check the expression of factors that constitute the machinery of the small interfering RNA (siRNA) and microRNA (miRNA) pathways in different tissues and stages of the silkmoth, Bombyx mori. It was found that the dsRNA-binding protein R2D2, an essential component in the siRNA pathway in Drosophila, was expressed at minimal levels in silkmoth tissues. The silkmoth-derived Bm5 cell line was also deficient in expression of mRNA encoding full-length BmTranslin, an RNA-binding factor that has been shown to stimulate the efficiency of RNAi. However, despite the lack of expression of the RNA-binding proteins, silencing of a luciferase reporter gene was observed by co-transfection of luc dsRNA using a lipophilic reagent. In contrast, gene silencing was not detected when the cells were soaked in culture medium supplemented with dsRNA. The introduction of an expression construct for Tribolium R2D2 (TcR2D2) did not influence the potency of luc dsRNA to silence the luciferase reporter. Immunostaining experiments further showed that both TcR2D2 and BmTranslin accumulated at defined locations within the cytoplasm of transfected cells. Our results offer a first evaluation of the expression of the RNAi machinery in silkmoth tissues and Bm5 cells and provide evidence for a functional RNAi response to intracellular dsRNA in the absence of R2D2 and Translin. The failure of TcR2D2 to stimulate the intracellular RNAi pathway in Bombyx cells is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W2049038992,"Differentiation of T helper 17 cells (Th17) is a multistep process that involves the cytokines IL-6, TGF-β, and IL-23 as well as IL-1β, IL-21, and TNF-α. Thereby, robust induction of the capacity to produce IL-17 involves epigenetic modifications of the syntenic Il17a/f locus. Using inbred mouse strains, we identified co-regulation of gene transcription at the Il17a/f locus with the nearby microRNAs miR-133b and miR-206 that are clustered approximately 45 kb upstream of Il17a/f. Expression of these microRNAs was specific for Th17 as compared to other CD4+ T cell subsets and this was equally valid for in vitro polarized and ex vivo derived cells. From all factors analyzed, IL-23 was the most important cytokine for the in vitro induction of miR-133b and miR-206 in naive CD4+ T cells of wild type mice. However, analysis of IL-23R deficient mice revealed that IL-23R signaling was not essential for the induction of miR-133b and miR-206. Importantly, we found a similar co-regulation in CCR6+ and other γδ T cell subsets that are predisposed to production of IL-17. Taken together, we discovered a novel feature of T cell differentiation towards an IL-17-producing phenotype that is shared between αβ and γδ T cells. Notably, the specific co-regulation of miR-133b and miR-206 with the Il17a/f locus also extended to human Th17 cells. This qualifies expression of miR-133b and miR-206 in T cells as novel biomarkers for Th17-type immune reactions."
https://openalex.org/W2093129300,"Dentin matrix phosphoprotein 1 (DMP1) is a non-collagenous, acidic extracellular matrix protein expressed chiefly in bone and dentin. We examined the DMP1 ability to engage cell-surface receptors and subsequently activate intracellular signaling pathways. Our data indeed show that the presence of extracellular DMP1 triggers focal adhesion point formation in human mesenchymal stem cells and osteoblast-like cells. We determine that DMP1 acts via interaction with αvβ3 integrin and stimulates phosphorylation of focal adhesion kinase. Further biochemical characterization confirms the activation of downstream effectors of the MAPK pathways, namely ERK and JNK, after DMP1 treatment. This activation is specifically inhibitable and can also be blocked by the addition of anti-αvβ3 integrin antibody. Furthermore, we show that extracellular treatment with DMP1 stimulates the translocation of phosphorylated JNK to the nucleus and a concomitant up-regulation of transcriptional activation by phosphorylated c-Jun. The evidence presented here indicates that DMP1 is specifically involved in signaling via extracellular matrix-cell surface interaction. Combined with the published DMP1-null data (Feng, J. Q., Ward, L. M., Liu, S., Lu, Y., Xie, Y., Yuan, B., Yu, X., Rauch, F., Davis, S. I., Zhang, S., Rios, H., Drezner, M. K., Quarles, L. D., Bonewald, L. F., and White, K. E. (2006) Nat.

Dysregulation of ADAM activity may contribute to the pathogenesis of vascular diseases, but the mechanisms underlying the control of ADAM functions are still incompletely understood. Atherosclerosis is characterized by lipid plaque formation and local accumulation of unsaturated free fatty acids (FFA). Here, we show that unsaturated FFA increase ADAM-mediated substrate cleavage. We demonstrate that these alterations are not due to genuine changes in enzyme activity, but correlate with changes in membrane fluidity as revealed by measurement of 1,6-diphenyl-1,3,5-hexatriene fluorescence anisotropy and fluorescence recovery after photobleaching analyses. ELISA and immunoblot experiments conducted with granulocytes, endothelial cells, and keratinocytes revealed rapid increase of ectodomain shedding of ADAM10 and ADAM17 substrates upon membrane fluidization. Large amounts of unsaturated FFA may be liberated from cholesteryl esters in LDL that is entrapped in atherosclerotic lesions. Incubation of cells with thus modified LDL resulted in rapid cleavage of ADAM substrates with corresponding functional consequences on cell proliferation, cell migration, and endothelial permeability, events of high significance in atherogenesis.

https://openalex.org/W2022704464,"DNA glycosylases play a major role in the repair of deaminated DNA damage. Previous investigations identified five families within the uracil-DNA glycosylase (UDG) superfamily. All enzymes within the superfamily studied thus far exhibit uracil-DNA glycosylase activity. Here we identify a new class of DNA glycosylases in the UDG superfamily that lacks UDG activity. Instead, these enzymes act as hypoxanthine-DNA glycosylases in vitro and in vivo. Molecular modeling and structure-guided mutational analysis allowed us to identify a unique catalytic center in this class of DNA glycosylases. Based on unprecedented biochemical properties and phylogenetic analysis, we propose this new class of DNA repair glycosylases that exists in bacteria, archaea, and eukaryotes as family 6 and designate it as the hypoxanthine-DNA glycosylase family. This study demonstrates the structural evolvability that underlies substrate specificity and catalytic flexibility in the evolution of enzymatic function."
https://openalex.org/W2045246351,"Background Ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF), a member of the interleukin-6 cytokine family, has been implicated in the development, differentiation and survival of retinal neurons. The mechanisms of CNTF action as well as its cellular targets in the retina are poorly understood. It has been postulated that some of the biological effects of CNTF are mediated through its action via retinal glial cells; however, molecular changes in retinal glia induced by CNTF have not been elucidated. We have, therefore, examined gene expression dynamics of purified Müller (glial) cells exposed to CNTF in vivo. Methodology/Principal Findings Müller cells were flow-sorted from mgfap-egfp transgenic mice one or three days after intravitreal injection of CNTF. Microarray analysis using RNA from purified Müller cells showed differential expression of almost 1,000 transcripts with two- to seventeen-fold change in response to CNTF. A comparison of transcriptional profiles from Müller cells at one or three days after CNTF treatment showed an increase in the number of transcribed genes as well as a change in the expression pattern. Ingenuity Pathway Analysis showed that the differentially regulated genes belong to distinct functional types such as cytokines, growth factors, G-protein coupled receptors, transporters and ion channels. Interestingly, many genes induced by CNTF were also highly expressed in reactive Müller cells from mice with inherited or experimentally induced retinal degeneration. Further analysis of gene profiles revealed 20–30% overlap in the transcription pattern among Müller cells, astrocytes and the RPE. Conclusions/Significance Our studies provide novel molecular insights into biological functions of Müller glial cells in mediating cytokine response. We suggest that CNTF remodels the gene expression profile of Müller cells leading to induction of networks associated with transcription, cell cycle regulation and inflammatory response. CNTF also appears to function as an inducer of gliosis in the retina."

IntroductionThe regulation of gene expression in eukaryotes is a complex series of events that is well coordinated by different cellular machineries. Central to this process is the regulation of mRNA metabolism. It begins with transcription followed by pre-mRNA processing in the nucleus, nucleo-cytoplasmic transport, translation, and finally, the controlled degradation of mRNA.mRNA degradation is one of the important means of mRNA quality control. In eukaryotic cells two major pathways have evolved for mRNA degradation; they are non-sense-mediated decay, which is deadenylation-independent and the more ubiquitously used deadenylation-dependent pathway (1Garneau N.L. Wilusz J. Wilusz C.J. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2007; 8: 113-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (929) Google Scholar). Non-sense-mediated decay is the process of choice for quick and efficient removal of transcripts with non-sense codons, unspliced introns, or extended 3′-UTR (2Chang Y.F. Imam J.S. Wilkinson M.F. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2007; 76: 51-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (934) Google Scholar). The deadenylation-dependent pathway begins with the removal of the 3′-poly(A) tail by 3′-5′ exonucleases Ccr4 and Pop2 or poly(A) nuclease (3Brown C.E. Tarun Jr., S.Z. Boeck R. Sachs A.B. Mol. Cell.

Although the formation of P-bodies have been initially associated with mRNA decay and storing translationally repressed RNA, recent studies have shown that they not terminal centers of RNA degradation, as a subset of translationally repressed RNA can reenter the active pool in response to cellular signals (11Coller J.M. Tucker M. Sheth U. Valencia-Sanchez M.A. Parker R. RNA. 2001; 7: 1717-1727Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar, 21Balagopal V. Parker R. Curr. Opin.

Dhh1 localizes to P-bodies and stimulates mRNA decapping, possibly by interacting with the decapping enzyme Dcp1p (11Coller J.M. Tucker M. Sheth U. Valencia-Sanchez M.A. Parker R. RNA. 2001; 7: 1717-1727Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar, 24Fischer N. Weis K. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 2788-2797Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 25Teixeira D. Parker R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2007; 18: 2274-2287Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Dhh1, along with its interacting partners Pat1 and Edc3, is also involved in translational repression of mRNAs and has been shown to sequester RNAs into a non-translating pool that does not undergo degradation (22Brengues M. Teixeira D. Parker R. Science. 2005; 310: 486-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (576) Google Scholar, 25Teixeira D. Parker R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2007; 18: 2274-2287Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar, 26Coller J. Parker R. Cell. 2005; 122: 875-886Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (477) Google Scholar). Studies have linked Dhh1 to cell cycle regulation, where it is important for G1/S DNA-damage checkpoint recovery in Saccharomyces cerevisiae (27Bergkessel M. Reese J.C. Genetics. 2004; 167: 21-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 28Westmoreland T.J. Olson J.A. Saito W.Y. Huper G. Marks J.R. Bennett C.B. J. Surg. Res. 2003; 113: 62-73Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Recent studies have also shown that Dhh1 controls hyphal development (29Park Y.U. Hur H. Ka M. Kim J. Eukaryot. Cell. 2006; 5: 2120-2127Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Thus, although not essential for normal cell growth, this protein plays a number of important functions.Dhh1 also interacts with the evolutionary conserved Ccr4-Not complex (30Hata H. Mitsui H. Liu H. Bai Y. Denis C.L. Shimizu Y. Sakai A. Genetics. 1998; 148: 571-579PubMed Google Scholar, 31Maillet L. Collart M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 2835-2842Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Multiple roles have been assigned to the Ccr4-Not complex in regulating the life of mRNAs (32Collart M.A. Timmers H.T. Prog. Nucleic Acid Res. Mol. Biol. 2004; 77: 289-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 33Collart M.A. Gene. 2003; 313: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar, 34Denis C.L. Chen J. Prog. Nucleic Acid Res. Mol. Biol. 2003; 73: 221-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). First identified as a complex regulating transcription initiation, it was later shown that the Ccr4 subunit is the major poly(A) deadenylase (5Tucker M. Staples R.R. Valencia-Sanchez M.A. Muhlrad D. Parker R. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 1427-1436Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar, 6Tucker M. Valencia-Sanchez M.A. Staples R.R. Chen J. Denis C.L. Parker R. Cell. 2001; 104: 377-386Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar). Although the later observations raised questions about the function of Ccr4-Not in transcription, we recently confirmed that the Ccr4-Not complex interacts with elongating RNAPII and directly regulates transcription elongation (35Kruk J.A. Dutta A. Fu J. Gilmour D.S. Reese J.C. Genes Dev. 2011; 25: 581-593Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). It appears that the Ccr4-Not complex, and not Ccr4 specifically, regulates mRNA decay because even the Not group of proteins has been found localized to P bodies and regulates mRNA half-lives (36Muhlrad D. Parker R. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 1033-1045Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Thus, this complex provides a link to transcription in the nucleus and mRNA decay in the cytoplasm.Dhh1 shows exceptional sequence conservation. For example, the human orthologue of Dhh1, Ddx6 (rck/p54), bears a 69% identity and 83% similarity to Dhh1. Ddx6 can complement the phenotypes of a dhh1Δ mutant (27Bergkessel M. Reese J.C. Genetics. 2004; 167: 21-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), suggesting they play similar roles in regulating cell function in their respective organisms. Dhh1 belongs to the superfamily 2 (Sf2) of DEXD/H-box proteins (37Strahl-Bolsinger S. Tanner W. Yeast. 1993; 9: 429-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Sf2 helicases contain nine conserved helicase motifs. DEXD/H-box proteins have been reported to be components of various cellular machineries that regulate mRNA metabolism and are involved in mRNA splicing, transport, translation, decay, ribosome biogenesis, and transcription in both eukaryotes and prokaryotes (38Bleichert F. Baserga S.J. Mol. Cell. 2007; 27: 339-352Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar, 39Cordin O. Banroques J. Tanner N.K. Linder P.

Fairman M.E. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2007; 17: 316-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Many of these functions have been attributed to the ability of these proteins to act as helicases and disrupt RNA secondary structure. In addition, several DEXD/H-box proteins are shown to displace protein factors from single-stranded RNA without duplex unwinding (42Bizebard T. Ferlenghi I. Iost I. Dreyfus M. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 7857-7866Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 43Kikuma T. Ohtsu M. Utsugi T. Koga S. Okuhara K. Eki T. Fujimori F. Murakami Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 20692-20698Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The crystal structure of the core domain of Dhh1 was recently solved, and its domain structure compares well with that of other DEAD-box helicases like S. cerevisiae eIF4A, MjDEAD, Drosophila melanogaster Vasa, and hepatitis C virus NS3 (44Cheng Z. Coller J. Parker R. Song H. RNA. 2005; 11: 1258-1270Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). However, there are distinct differences in the relative orientation of the two globular (RecA-like) domains in Dhh1 compared with other DEXD/H proteins. It was proposed that interdomain interactions within Dhh1 might regulate its activity (44Cheng Z. Coller J. Parker R. Song H. RNA. 2005; 11: 1258-1270Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). The structure of Dhh1 has been insightful in predicting domain orientations and key residues that may be involved in enzymatic function; however, enzymatic activities of Dhh1 have not been observed. Many questions remain as to how the various biochemical activities of Dhh1 regulate the multiple functions of this important helicase. Specifically, does the unusual conformation of the Dhh1 predicted from the crystal structure regulate its biochemical activities and its cellular functions in vivo?Here we provide the first analysis of Dhh1 ATPase and ATP binding activities and have identified key residues involved in ATP and RNA binding and ATP hydrolysis. Interestingly, Dhh1 has weaker ATPase activity compared with other DEAD-box helicases, and we present data arguing that the intermolecular interactions between the N- and C-terminal domains restrict its ATPase activity. Disruption of these interactions through mutagenesis increases ATP hydrolysis and enhances its mRNA metabolism and mRNA binding functions in vivo. Based on our results, we hypothesize that Dhh1 activity is restricted by interdomain interactions, which can be regulated by cellular factors to impart stringent control over this very abundant RNA helicase.

Dhh1 localizes to P-bodies and stimulates mRNA decapping, possibly by interacting with the decapping enzyme Dcp1p (11Coller J.M. Tucker M. Sheth U. Valencia-Sanchez M.A. Parker R.

Dhh1, along with its interacting partners Pat1 and Edc3, is also involved in translational repression of mRNAs and has been shown to sequester RNAs into a non-translating pool that does not undergo degradation (22Brengues M.

Studies have linked Dhh1 to cell cycle regulation, where it is important for G1/S DNA-damage checkpoint recovery in Saccharomyces cerevisiae (27Bergkessel M. Reese J.C.

Thus, although not essential for normal cell growth, this protein plays a number of important functions.Dhh1 also interacts with the evolutionary conserved Ccr4-Not complex (30Hata H. Mitsui H.

Although the later observations raised questions about the function of Ccr4-Not in transcription, we recently confirmed that the Ccr4-Not complex interacts with elongating RNAPII and directly regulates transcription elongation (35Kruk J.A. Dutta A. Fu J. Gilmour D.S. Reese J.C. Genes Dev. 2011; 25: 581-593Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). It appears that the Ccr4-Not complex, and not Ccr4 specifically, regulates mRNA decay because even the Not group of proteins has been found localized to P bodies and regulates mRNA half-lives (36Muhlrad D. Parker R. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 1033-1045Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Thus, this complex provides a link to transcription in the nucleus and mRNA decay in the cytoplasm.Dhh1 shows exceptional sequence conservation. For example, the human orthologue of Dhh1, Ddx6 (rck/p54), bears a 69% identity and 83% similarity to Dhh1. Ddx6 can complement the phenotypes of a dhh1Δ mutant (27Bergkessel M. Reese J.C. Genetics. 2004; 167: 21-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), suggesting they play similar roles in regulating cell function in their respective organisms. Dhh1 belongs to the superfamily 2 (Sf2) of DEXD/H-box proteins (37Strahl-Bolsinger S. Tanner W. Yeast. 1993; 9: 429-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Sf2 helicases contain nine conserved helicase motifs. DEXD/H-box proteins have been reported to be components of various cellular machineries that regulate mRNA metabolism and are involved in mRNA splicing, transport, translation, decay, ribosome biogenesis, and transcription in both eukaryotes and prokaryotes (38Bleichert F. Baserga S.J. Mol. Cell. 2007; 27: 339-352Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar, 39Cordin O. Banroques J. Tanner N.K. Linder P.

Many of these functions have been attributed to the ability of these proteins to act as helicases and disrupt RNA secondary structure. In addition, several DEXD/H-box proteins are shown to displace protein factors from single-stranded RNA without duplex unwinding (42Bizebard T. Ferlenghi I. Iost I. Dreyfus M.

The crystal structure of the core domain of Dhh1 was recently solved, and its domain structure compares well with that of other DEAD-box helicases like S. cerevisiae eIF4A, MjDEAD, Drosophila melanogaster Vasa, and hepatitis C virus NS3 (44Cheng Z. Coller J. Parker R. Song H. RNA. 2005; 11: 1258-1270Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). However, there are distinct differences in the relative orientation of the two globular (RecA-like) domains in Dhh1 compared with other DEXD/H proteins. It was proposed that interdomain interactions within Dhh1 might regulate its activity (44Cheng Z. Coller J. Parker R. Song H. RNA. 2005; 11: 1258-1270Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). The structure of Dhh1 has been insightful in predicting domain orientations and key residues that may be involved in enzymatic function; however, enzymatic activities of Dhh1 have not been observed. Many questions remain as to how the various biochemical activities of Dhh1 regulate the multiple functions of this important helicase. Specifically, does the unusual conformation of the Dhh1 predicted from the crystal structure regulate its biochemical activities and its cellular functions in vivo?Here we provide the first analysis of Dhh1 ATPase and ATP binding activities and have identified key residues involved in ATP and RNA binding and ATP hydrolysis. Interestingly, Dhh1 has weaker ATPase activity compared with other DEAD-box helicases, and we present data arguing that the intermolecular interactions between the N- and C-terminal domains restrict its ATPase activity. Disruption of these interactions through mutagenesis increases ATP hydrolysis and enhances its mRNA metabolism and mRNA binding functions in vivo. Based on our results, we hypothesize that Dhh1 activity is restricted by interdomain interactions, which can be regulated by cellular factors to impart stringent control over this very abundant RNA helicase. The regulation of gene expression in eukaryotes is a complex series of events that is well coordinated by different cellular machineries. Central to this process is the regulation of mRNA metabolism. It begins with transcription followed by pre-mRNA processing in the nucleus, nucleo-cytoplasmic transport, translation, and finally, the controlled degradation of mRNA. mRNA degradation is one of the important means of mRNA quality control. In eukaryotic cells two major pathways have evolved for mRNA degradation; they are non-sense-mediated decay, which is deadenylation-independent and the more ubiquitously used deadenylation-dependent pathway (1Garneau N.L. Wilusz J. Wilusz C.J. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2007; 8: 113-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (929) Google Scholar). Non-sense-mediated decay is the process of choice for quick and efficient removal of transcripts with non-sense codons, unspliced introns, or extended 3′-UTR (2Chang Y.F. Imam J.S. Wilkinson M.F. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2007; 76: 51-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (934) Google Scholar). The deadenylation-dependent pathway begins with the removal of the 3′-poly(A) tail by 3′-5′ exonucleases Ccr4 and Pop2 or poly(A) nuclease (3Brown C.E. Tarun Jr., S.Z. Boeck R. Sachs A.B. Mol. Cell.

The binding of Dcp1/Dcp2 to the 5′ cap and decapping are enhanced by a complex of seven Lsm (like-Sm) proteins (Lsm1 through Lsm7), Pat1, Edc3, and Dhh1 (10Bonnerot C. Boeck R. Lapeyre B. Mol. Cell.

https://openalex.org/W2016346417,"Genome integrity is maintained by a network of DNA damage response pathways, including checkpoints and DNA repair processes. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the BRCT domain-containing protein Rtt107/Esc4 is required for the restart of DNA replication after successful repair of DNA damage and for cellular resistance to DNA-damaging agents. In addition to its well characterized interaction with the endonuclease Slx4, Rtt107 interacts with a number of other DNA repair and recombination proteins. These include the evolutionarily conserved SMC5/6 complex, which is involved in numerous chromosome maintenance activities, such as DNA repair, chromosome segregation, and telomere function. The interaction between Rtt107 and the SMC5/6 complex was mediated through the N-terminal BRCT domains of Rtt107 and the Nse6 subunit of SMC5/6 and was independent of methyl methane sulfonate-induced damage and Slx4. Supporting a shared function in the DNA damage response, Rtt107 was required for recruitment of SMC5/6 to DNA double strand breaks. However, this functional relationship did not extend to other types of DNA lesions such as protein-bound nicks. Interestingly, Rtt107 was phosphorylated when SMC5/6 function was compromised in the absence of DNA-damaging agents, indicating a connection beyond the DNA damage response. Genetic analyses revealed that, although a subset of Rtt107 and SMC5/6 functions was shared, these proteins also contributed independently to maintenance of genome integrity."
https://openalex.org/W2021759819,"Receptor-mediated activation of protein kinase (PK) C is a central pathway regulating cell growth, homeostasis, and programmed death. Recently, we showed that calpain-mediated proteolytic processing of PKCα in ischemic myocardium activates PKC signaling in a receptor-independent manner by releasing a persistent and constitutively active free catalytic fragment, PKCα-CT. This unregulated kinase provokes cardiomyopathy, but the mechanisms remain unclear. Here, we demonstrate that PKCα-CT is a potent regulator of pathological cardiac gene expression. PKCα-CT constitutively localizes to nuclei and directly promotes nucleo-cytoplasmic shuttling of HDAC5, inducing expression of apoptosis and other deleterious genes. Whereas PKD activation is required for HDAC5 nuclear export induced by unprocessed PKCs activated by phorbol ester, PKCα-CT directly drives HDAC cytosolic relocalization. Activation of MEF2-dependent inflammatory pathway genes by PKCα-CT can induce a cell-autonomous transcriptional response that mimics, but anticipates, actual inflammation. Because calpain-mediated processing of PKC isoforms occurs in many tissues wherein calcium is increased by stress or injury, our observation that the catalytically active product of this interaction is a constitutively active transcriptional regulator has broad ramifications for understanding and preventing the pathological transcriptional stress response. Receptor-mediated activation of protein kinase (PK) C is a central pathway regulating cell growth, homeostasis, and programmed death. Recently, we showed that calpain-mediated proteolytic processing of PKCα in ischemic myocardium activates PKC signaling in a receptor-independent manner by releasing a persistent and constitutively active free catalytic fragment, PKCα-CT. This unregulated kinase provokes cardiomyopathy, but the mechanisms remain unclear. Here, we demonstrate that PKCα-CT is a potent regulator of pathological cardiac gene expression. PKCα-CT constitutively localizes to nuclei and directly promotes nucleo-cytoplasmic shuttling of HDAC5, inducing expression of apoptosis and other deleterious genes. Whereas PKD activation is required for HDAC5 nuclear export induced by unprocessed PKCs activated by phorbol ester, PKCα-CT directly drives HDAC cytosolic relocalization. Activation of MEF2-dependent inflammatory pathway genes by PKCα-CT can induce a cell-autonomous transcriptional response that mimics, but anticipates, actual inflammation. Because calpain-mediated processing of PKC isoforms occurs in many tissues wherein calcium is increased by stress or injury, our observation that the catalytically active product of this interaction is a constitutively active transcriptional regulator has broad ramifications for understanding and preventing the pathological transcriptional stress response.

Of cardiac-expressed PKCs, PKCα is expressed at higher levels than other isoforms, is dynamically regulated in cardiac disease, and is implicated in functional decompensation and development of cardiomyopathy (2Hahn H.S.

Accordingly, there is a need to better understand isoform-specific actions of cardiac-expressed PKCs and to develop isoform-specific pharmacological PKC activators and inhibitors as therapeutics.PKCs regulate proteins directly through substrate phosphorylation on serines or threonines, or indirectly by phosphorylating positive and negative regulators of protein expression or function. An example of indirect PKC control is transcriptional up-regulation of the cell death factor, Nix, which mediates programmed cell death and the transition to dilated cardiomyopathy in Gq-mediated and pressure overload hypertrophy: PKC is activated via the canonical Gq/phospholipase C signaling pathway and activates the transcription factor SP1, which binds to and induces the Nix promoter (9Gálvez A.S. Brunskill E.W. Marreez Y. Benner B.J. Regula K.M. Kirschenbaum L.A. Dorn 2nd, G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 1442-1448Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Transcriptional changes induced by protein kinase C are implicated in other cardiac syndromes (10Chien K.R. Knowlton K.U. Zhu H. Chien S. FASEB.

Sugden P.H. Am. J. Cardiol. 1999; 83: 64H-69HAbstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). We recently described a mechanism for PKC activation in cardiac ischemia that bypasses the receptor-G protein signaling pathway (12Kang M.Y. Zhang Y. Matkovich S.J. Diwan A. Chishti A.H. Dorn 2nd, G.W. Circ. Res. 2010; 107: 903-912Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar): Calpain proteases are activated by increased cytosolic calcium in ischemic myocardium and cleave PKC at the hinge region, generating free N-terminal regulatory and C-terminal kinase fragments. The free N-terminal (NT) fragment of PKCα had no biological activity in cultured cells or mouse hearts, whereas the free C-terminal (CT) fragment of PKCα exhibited constitutive kinase activity and promiscuous substrate targeting. Forced PKCα-CT expression induced a dilated cardiomyopathy that progressed more rapidly and was more severe than that produced by overexpression of unprocessed PKCα at similar levels (3Braz J.C. Gregory K. Pathak A. Zhao W. Sahin B. Klevitsky R. Kimball T.F. Lorenz J.N. Nairn A.C. Liggett S.B. Bodi I. Wang S. Schwartz A. Lakatta E.G. DePaoli-Roach A.A. Robbins J. Hewett T.E. Bibb J.A.

Res. 2010; 107: 903-912Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar).Normal substrate phosphorylation by PKCs is critically dependent upon proper subcellular localization. As PKCα-CT lacks the N-terminal sites that direct normal PKC subcellular translocation (13Dorn 2nd, G.W. Mochly-Rosen D. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2002; 64: 407-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar), it is mistargeted, which may contribute to its promiscuous kinase activity. Previously, we established that receptor-independent, calpain-mediated PKCα signaling through PKCα-CT increased myocardial phosphoserine/threonine protein content and lead to an aggressive dilated cardiomyopathy (12Kang M.Y. Zhang Y. Matkovich S.J. Diwan A. Chishti A.H. Dorn 2nd, G.W. Circ. Res. 2010; 107: 903-912Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). However, the changes in the cardiac phosphoproteome of PKCα-CT hearts relative to that of unprocessed PKCα-expressing hearts were modest in comparison to the severity and rapid progression of the PKCα-CT-induced cardiomyopathy. We hypothesized that one or a few atypical effects of PKCα-CT, rather than the general increase in kinase activity, produced the deleterious effects.Here, using microarray RNA expression profiling and RNA-sequencing, we reveal that PKCα-CT is a powerful transcriptional activator in otherwise normal mouse hearts. Transcriptional activity derives in part from partial constitutive nuclear localization of the free PKCα-CT peptide, leading to HDAC5 nuclear export that de-represses expression of MEF2-dependent pathological genes. These results uncover a receptor-independent pathway for transcriptional regulation by an ischemia-induced, PKCα-derived rogue kinase. The data provide further support for therapeutic use of direct kinase inhibitors in cardiac ischemia and other conditions wherein PKC can be proteolytically activated.DISCUSSIONWe recently described receptor-independent, calpain-mediated proteolytic processing of PKCα in ischemic hearts that generates a stable, constitutively active PKCα-CT kinase fragment, which is sufficient to cause dilated cardiomyopathy (12Kang M.Y. Zhang Y. Matkovich S.J. Diwan A. Chishti A.H. Dorn 2nd, G.W. Circ. Res. 2010; 107: 903-912Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). However, a mechanistic link between kinase activity and PKCα-CT-induced cardiomyopathy has not been clearly defined. Here, we report constitutive nuclear localization and transcriptional regulation by PKCα-CT that can explain at least some of its detrimental effects on the heart. Our studies further reveal a direct stimulatory effect of PKCα-CT on HDAC5 nuclear export that differentiates it from its parent kinase, PKCα, and that can provoke programmed cell death ensuing from calpain-mediated generation of this rogue kinase.Signaling pathways mediated via G-protein coupled receptors play important roles in the compensatory responses to cardiac stress, and in functional decompensation that ensues when these mechanisms fail. Gq/phospholipase C signaling initiated by angiotensin, α-adrenergic, and other cardiomyocyte receptors is implicated in pathological hypertrophy and the transition to heart failure (34Dorn 2nd, G.W. Force T. J. Clin. Invest. 2005; 115: 527-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (532) Google Scholar). Conventional PKC isoforms (α, βI, βII, and γ) are activated by these Gq/phospholipase C-coupled receptors as the consequence of increased intracellular calcium and phospholipid, which bind to specific domains within the regulatory N-terminal half of PKCs (35Nishizuka Y. Nature. 1988; 334: 661-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (3523) Google Scholar, 36Bright R. Mochly-Rosen D. Stroke. 2005; 36: 2781-2790Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar, 37Mackay H.J. Twelves C.J. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2007; 7: 554-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar, 38Churchill E. Budas G. Vallentin A. Koyanagi T. Mochly-Rosen D. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2008; 48: 569-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Calcium and phospholipid binding induce allosteric changes that expose ATP- and substrate-binding domains located within the catalytic carboxy-terminal half of the protein (39Newton A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28495-28498Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1466) Google Scholar). Because PKC unfolding after calcium and phospholipid binding also exposes binding domains for PKC anchoring proteins (RACKs), receptor-mediated PKC activation stimulates PKC translocation from cytosol to particulate cell membranes. Spatial restriction thus produces substrate specificity (13Dorn 2nd, G.W. Mochly-Rosen D. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2002; 64: 407-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Because PKC activity has a narrow physiological range, it is limited not only in space, but in time: PKC-activating calcium and phospholipid second messengers are evanescent, lasting only seconds to minutes. As these PKC-activating signals expire, the inactive PKC molecular configuration is restored (temporal restriction). Importantly, post-translational formation of PKCα-CT by calpain-mediated proteolytic processing generates a kinase lacking both of these normal physiological restraints: PKCα-CT lacks the N-terminal targeting domains, and therefore accesses atypical subcellular compartments and abnormal substrates. PKCα-CT also lacks the N-terminal autoinhibitory domains and is therefore constitutively and persistently active (12Kang M.Y. Zhang Y. Matkovich S.J. Diwan A. Chishti A.H. Dorn 2nd, G.W. Circ. Res. 2010; 107: 903-912Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar).Calpain-generated PKCα-CT corresponds approximately to Nishizuka's description of PKMα and Olson's artificial PKC mutant, PKC-8 (36Bright R. Mochly-Rosen D. Stroke. 2005; 36: 2781-2790Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar, 40Young S. Parker P.J. Ullrich A. Stabel S. Biochem. J. 1987; 244: 775-779Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar). Our observation that full-length cardiomyocyte PKCα and PKCα-NT are largely cytosolic, whereas PKCα-CT also resides in the nuclear fraction, echos the findings of James and Olson (41James G. Olson E. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 116: 863-874Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) who reported that: 1. Inactive PKCα in transfected CHO cells and C2 myoblasts was largely cytosolic and underwent nuclear translocation after activation with phorbol ester; 2. A PKCα truncation mutant lacking the catalytic domain (PKC-TM310; analogous to the PKCα-NT calpain proteolysis product) is cytosolic and unstable; and 3. A PKCα truncation mutant consisting only of the PKCα catalytic domain (PKC-8; analogous to the PKCα-CT calpain proteolysis product) is stable and constitutively localized to Triton-insoluble and nuclear fractions. Thus, in vitro mutational analysis of PKCα domains and in vivo analysis of the naturally occurring calpain-generated PKCα fragments agree that the free catalytic kinase domain will localize in part to cell nuclei and regulate gene transcription. It is worth noting that calpain-mediated processing of PKCs has been observed in many tissues, and that an analogous calpain-generated constitutively active PKCζ catalytic domain, designated PKMζ, plays a physiological role in maintaining long-term memory (42Sacktor T.C. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2011; 12: 9-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). Thus, genetic reprogramming by calpain-generated PKC-derived kinases may be a recurring theme in vertebrate biology.Nuclear-localized PKCα is thought to direct gene transcription by activating PKD, which phosphorylates class II HDACs, thus de-repressing MEF2-dependent genes (14Vega R.B. Harrison B.C. Meadows E. Roberts C.R. Papst P.J. Olson E.N. McKinsey T.A. Mol. Cell Biol. 2004; 24: 8374-8385Crossref PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar). Our results confirm that PKD is an essential downstream mediator of HDAC5 nuclear export mediated by endogenous COS7 cell PKCs and by unprocessed human PKCα. However, we found that PKCα-CT provoked HDAC5 nucleo-cytoplasmic shuttling independently of PKD by directly inducing HDAC phosphorylation. This describes a new receptor-independent pathway for transcriptional control. Previously described mechanisms for HDAC nuclear export include PKC, PKD, and CaM kinase II, all of which are calcium-dependent factors within G-protein-coupled receptor signaling pathways. HDAC phopshorylation by calpain-generated PKCα-CT links increased cell calcium and MEF2-dependent gene transcription in a manner that bypasses normal receptor signaling pathways, and therefore cannot be prevented by pharmacological receptor antagonism or receptor agonist synthesis inhibition.Cardiac gene reprogramming by PKCα-CT reproduced aspects of TNFα-stimulated gene expression. Pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNFα are linked to heart failure by activating their cardiomyocyte receptors and stimulating gene transcription via the well-characterized NFκB pathway (43Mann D.L. Heart. Fail. Rev. 2001; 6: 71-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Cytokine signaling thus coordinates the response of external inflammatory factors recruited to stressed or damaged myocardium and the cardiomyocytes in the area of stress or injury. Work in other cell types has implicated PKC signaling and HDAC nuclear export in atypical, NFκB-independent transcriptional activation by TNFα (44Catley M.C. Cambridge L.M. Nasuhara Y. Ito K. Chivers J.E. Beaton A. Holden N.S. Bergmann M.W. Barnes P.J. Newton R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 18457-18466Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 45Kumar A. Lin Z. SenBanerjee S. Jain M.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 5893-5903Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Activation of components of the inflammatory gene program by PKCα-CT in viable ischemic and/or reperfused is therefore a mechanism by which the cardiomyocyte transcriptional stress response is rapidly and persistently activated in a manner that anticipates actual mononuclear infiltration and local cytokine production.Our studies provide additional support for the approach of direct protein kinase inhibition in heart failure. Not only do we observe that an inhibitor of catalytical PKC activity prevented HDAC nuclear export induced by PMA, PKCα, and PKCα-CT, but we also found that Go6976 specifically inhibited constitutive PKCα-CT-induced HDAC nucleoplasmic shuttling. Go6976, which is an inhibitor of calcium-dependent protein kinase C isoforms and has additional activities as well (46Koivunen J. Aaltonen V. Koskela S. Lehenkari P. Laato M. Peltonen J. Cancer Res. 2004; 64: 5693-5701Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), failed to inhibit PMA-stimulated HDAC nuclear export, but abolished that constitutively induced by PKCα-CT. This finding demonstrates the feasibility of developing inhibitors with relative specificity for the strictly pathological free catalytic kinase fragments, but that spare normal receptor-mediated PKC signaling pathways that may have critical essential functions in non-involved tissues.

Brunskill E.W. Marreez Y. Benner B.J. Regula K.M. Kirschenbaum L.A. Dorn 2nd, G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 1442-1448Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Transcriptional changes induced by protein kinase C are implicated in other cardiac syndromes (10Chien K.R. Knowlton K.U. Zhu H. Chien S. FASEB. J. 1991; 5: 3037-3046Crossref PubMed Scopus (695) Google Scholar). Because PKCs are typically activated downstream of Gq-coupled receptors, angiotensin, α1-adrenergic, and endothelin receptor blockade can been used to interrupt PKC signaling (11Clerk A. Sugden P.H. Am. J. Cardiol. 1999; 83: 64H-69HAbstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). We recently described a mechanism for PKC activation in cardiac ischemia that bypasses the receptor-G protein signaling pathway (12Kang M.Y. Zhang Y. Matkovich S.J. Diwan A. Chishti A.H. Dorn 2nd, G.W. Circ. Res. 2010; 107: 903-912Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar): Calpain proteases are activated by increased cytosolic calcium in ischemic myocardium and cleave PKC at the hinge region, generating free N-terminal regulatory and C-terminal kinase fragments. The free N-terminal (NT) fragment of PKCα had no biological activity in cultured cells or mouse hearts, whereas the free C-terminal (CT) fragment of PKCα exhibited constitutive kinase activity and promiscuous substrate targeting. Forced PKCα-CT expression induced a dilated cardiomyopathy that progressed more rapidly and was more severe than that produced by overexpression of unprocessed PKCα at similar levels (3Braz J.C. Gregory K. Pathak A. Zhao W. Sahin B. Klevitsky R. Kimball T.F. Lorenz J.N. Nairn A.C. Liggett S.B. Bodi I. Wang S. Schwartz A. Lakatta E.G. DePaoli-Roach A.A. Robbins J. Hewett T.E. Bibb J.A.

Res. 2010; 107: 903-912Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Normal substrate phosphorylation by PKCs is critically dependent upon proper subcellular localization. As PKCα-CT lacks the N-terminal sites that direct normal PKC subcellular translocation (13Dorn 2nd, G.W. Mochly-Rosen D. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2002; 64: 407-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar), it is mistargeted, which may contribute to its promiscuous kinase activity. Previously, we established that receptor-independent, calpain-mediated PKCα signaling through PKCα-CT increased myocardial phosphoserine/threonine protein content and lead to an aggressive dilated cardiomyopathy (12Kang M.Y. Zhang Y. Matkovich S.J. Diwan A. Chishti A.H. Dorn 2nd, G.W. Circ. Res. 2010; 107: 903-912Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). However, the changes in the cardiac phosphoproteome of PKCα-CT hearts relative to that of unprocessed PKCα-expressing hearts were modest in comparison to the severity and rapid progression of the PKCα-CT-induced cardiomyopathy. We hypothesized that one or a few atypical effects of PKCα-CT, rather than the general increase in kinase activity, produced the deleterious effects. Here, using microarray RNA expression profiling and RNA-sequencing, we reveal that PKCα-CT is a powerful transcriptional activator in otherwise normal mouse hearts. Transcriptional activity derives in part from partial constitutive nuclear localization of the free PKCα-CT peptide, leading to HDAC5 nuclear export that de-represses expression of MEF2-dependent pathological genes. These results uncover a receptor-independent pathway for transcriptional regulation by an ischemia-induced, PKCα-derived rogue kinase. The data provide further support for therapeutic use of direct kinase inhibitors in cardiac ischemia and other conditions wherein PKC can be proteolytically activated. DISCUSSIONWe recently described receptor-independent, calpain-mediated proteolytic processing of PKCα in ischemic hearts that generates a stable, constitutively active PKCα-CT kinase fragment, which is sufficient to cause dilated cardiomyopathy (12Kang M.Y. Zhang Y. Matkovich S.J. Diwan A. Chishti A.H. Dorn 2nd, G.W. Circ. Res. 2010; 107: 903-912Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). However, a mechanistic link between kinase activity and PKCα-CT-induced cardiomyopathy has not been clearly defined. Here, we report constitutive nuclear localization and transcriptional regulation by PKCα-CT that can explain at least some of its detrimental effects on the heart. Our studies further reveal a direct stimulatory effect of PKCα-CT on HDAC5 nuclear export that differentiates it from its parent kinase, PKCα, and that can provoke programmed cell death ensuing from calpain-mediated generation of this rogue kinase.Signaling pathways mediated via G-protein coupled receptors play important roles in the compensatory responses to cardiac stress, and in functional decompensation that ensues when these mechanisms fail. Gq/phospholipase C signaling initiated by angiotensin, α-adrenergic, and other cardiomyocyte receptors is implicated in pathological hypertrophy and the transition to heart failure (34Dorn 2nd, G.W. Force T. J. Clin. Invest. 2005; 115: 527-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (532) Google Scholar). Conventional PKC isoforms (α, βI, βII, and γ) are activated by these Gq/phospholipase C-coupled receptors as the consequence of increased intracellular calcium and phospholipid, which bind to specific domains within the regulatory N-terminal half of PKCs (35Nishizuka Y. Nature. 1988; 334: 661-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (3523) Google Scholar, 36Bright R. Mochly-Rosen D. Stroke. 2005; 36: 2781-2790Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar, 37Mackay H.J. Twelves C.J. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2007; 7: 554-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar, 38Churchill E. Budas G. Vallentin A. Koyanagi T. Mochly-Rosen D. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2008; 48: 569-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Calcium and phospholipid binding induce allosteric changes that expose ATP- and substrate-binding domains located within the catalytic carboxy-terminal half of the protein (39Newton A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28495-28498Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1466) Google Scholar). Because PKC unfolding after calcium and phospholipid binding also exposes binding domains for PKC anchoring proteins (RACKs), receptor-mediated PKC activation stimulates PKC translocation from cytosol to particulate cell membranes. Spatial restriction thus produces substrate specificity (13Dorn 2nd, G.W. Mochly-Rosen D. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2002; 64: 407-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Because PKC activity has a narrow physiological range, it is limited not only in space, but in time: PKC-activating calcium and phospholipid second messengers are evanescent, lasting only seconds to minutes. As these PKC-activating signals expire, the inactive PKC molecular configuration is restored (temporal restriction). Importantly, post-translational formation of PKCα-CT by calpain-mediated proteolytic processing generates a kinase lacking both of these normal physiological restraints: PKCα-CT lacks the N-terminal targeting domains, and therefore accesses atypical subcellular compartments and abnormal substrates. PKCα-CT also lacks the N-terminal autoinhibitory domains and is therefore constitutively and persistently active (12Kang M.Y. Zhang Y. Matkovich S.J. Diwan A. Chishti A.H. Dorn 2nd, G.W. Circ. Res. 2010; 107: 903-912Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar).Calpain-generated PKCα-CT corresponds approximately to Nishizuka's description of PKMα and Olson's artificial PKC mutant, PKC-8 (36Bright R. Mochly-Rosen D. Stroke. 2005; 36: 2781-2790Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar, 40Young S. Parker P.J. Ullrich A. Stabel S. Biochem. J. 1987; 244: 775-779Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar). Our observation that full-length cardiomyocyte PKCα and PKCα-NT are largely cytosolic, whereas PKCα-CT also resides in the nuclear fraction, echos the findings of James and Olson (41James G. Olson E. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 116: 863-874Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) who reported that: 1. Inactive PKCα in transfected CHO cells and C2 myoblasts was largely cytosolic and underwent nuclear translocation after activation with phorbol ester; 2. A PKCα truncation mutant lacking the catalytic domain (PKC-TM310; analogous to the PKCα-NT calpain proteolysis product) is cytosolic and unstable; and 3. A PKCα truncation mutant consisting only of the PKCα catalytic domain (PKC-8; analogous to the PKCα-CT calpain proteolysis product) is stable and constitutively localized to Triton-insoluble and nuclear fractions. Thus, in vitro mutational analysis of PKCα domains and in vivo analysis of the naturally occurring calpain-generated PKCα fragments agree that the free catalytic kinase domain will localize in part to cell nuclei and regulate gene transcription. It is worth noting that calpain-mediated processing of PKCs has been observed in many tissues, and that an analogous calpain-generated constitutively active PKCζ catalytic domain, designated PKMζ, plays a physiological role in maintaining long-term memory (42Sacktor T.C. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2011; 12: 9-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). Thus, genetic reprogramming by calpain-generated PKC-derived kinases may be a recurring theme in vertebrate biology.Nuclear-localized PKCα is thought to direct gene transcription by activating PKD, which phosphorylates class II HDACs, thus de-repressing MEF2-dependent genes (14Vega R.B. Harrison B.C. Meadows E. Roberts C.R. Papst P.J. Olson E.N. McKinsey T.A. Mol. Cell Biol. 2004; 24: 8374-8385Crossref PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar). Our results confirm that PKD is an essential downstream mediator of HDAC5 nuclear export mediated by endogenous COS7 cell PKCs and by unprocessed human PKCα. However, we found that PKCα-CT provoked HDAC5 nucleo-cytoplasmic shuttling independently of PKD by directly inducing HDAC phosphorylation. This describes a new receptor-independent pathway for transcriptional control. Previously described mechanisms for HDAC nuclear export include PKC, PKD, and CaM kinase II, all of which are calcium-dependent factors within G-protein-coupled receptor signaling pathways. HDAC phopshorylation by calpain-generated PKCα-CT links increased cell calcium and MEF2-dependent gene transcription in a manner that bypasses normal receptor signaling pathways, and therefore cannot be prevented by pharmacological receptor antagonism or receptor agonist synthesis inhibition.Cardiac gene reprogramming by PKCα-CT reproduced aspects of TNFα-stimulated gene expression. Pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNFα are linked to heart failure by activating their cardiomyocyte receptors and stimulating gene transcription via the well-characterized NFκB pathway (43Mann D.L. Heart. Fail. Rev. 2001; 6: 71-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Cytokine signaling thus coordinates the response of external inflammatory factors recruited to stressed or damaged myocardium and the cardiomyocytes in the area of stress or injury. Work in other cell types has implicated PKC signaling and HDAC nuclear export in atypical, NFκB-independent transcriptional activation by TNFα (44Catley M.C. Cambridge L.M. Nasuhara Y. Ito K. Chivers J.E. Beaton A. Holden N.S. Bergmann M.W. Barnes P.J. Newton R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 18457-18466Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 45Kumar A. Lin Z. SenBanerjee S. Jain M.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 5893-5903Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Activation of components of the inflammatory gene program by PKCα-CT in viable ischemic and/or reperfused is therefore a mechanism by which the cardiomyocyte transcriptional stress response is rapidly and persistently activated in a manner that anticipates actual mononuclear infiltration and local cytokine production.Our studies provide additional support for the approach of direct protein kinase inhibition in heart failure. Not only do we observe that an inhibitor of catalytical PKC activity prevented HDAC nuclear export induced by PMA, PKCα, and PKCα-CT, but we also found that Go6976 specifically inhibited constitutive PKCα-CT-induced HDAC nucleoplasmic shuttling. Go6976, which is an inhibitor of calcium-dependent protein kinase C isoforms and has additional activities as well (46Koivunen J. Aaltonen V. Koskela S. Lehenkari P. Laato M. Peltonen J. Cancer Res. 2004; 64: 5693-5701Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), failed to inhibit PMA-stimulated HDAC nuclear export, but abolished that constitutively induced by PKCα-CT. This finding demonstrates the feasibility of developing inhibitors with relative specificity for the strictly pathological free catalytic kinase fragments, but that spare normal receptor-mediated PKC signaling pathways that may have critical essential functions in non-involved tissues. We recently described receptor-independent, calpain-mediated proteolytic processing of PKCα in ischemic hearts that generates a stable, constitutively active PKCα-CT kinase fragment, which is sufficient to cause dilated cardiomyopathy (12Kang M.Y.

The arrays measure a protein's affinity toward thousands of double-stranded DNA sequences at once, producing a comprehensive binding specificity catalog. We present a linear model for predicting the binding affinity of a protein toward DNA sequences based on PBM data. Our model represents the measured intensity of an individual probe as a sum of the binding affinity contributions of the probe's subsequences. These subsequences characterize a DNA binding motif and can be used to predict the intensity of protein binding against arbitrary DNA sequences.

https://openalex.org/W2125662285,"N-Glycans of the Na,K-ATPase β₁ subunit are important for intercellular adhesion in epithelia, suggesting that epithelial junctions depend on N-glycan-mediated interactions between the β₁ subunits of neighboring cells. The level of co-immunoprecipitation of the endogenous β₁ subunit with various YFP-linked β₁ subunits expressed in Madin-Darby canine kidney cells was used to assess β₁-β₁ interactions. The amount of co-precipitated endogenous dog β₁ was greater with dog YFP-β₁ than with rat YFP-β₁, showing that amino acid-mediated interactions are important for β₁-β₁ binding. Co-precipitation of β₁ was also less with the unglycosylated YFP-β₁ than with glycosylated YFP-β₁, indicating a role for N-glycans. Mixing cells expressing dog YFP-β₁ with non-transfected cells increased the amount of co-precipitated β₁, confirming the presence of intercellular (YFP-β₁)-β₁ complexes. Accordingly, disruption of intercellular junctions decreased the amount of co-precipitated β₁ subunits. The decrease in β₁ co-precipitation both with rat YFP-β₁ and unglycosylated YFP-β₁ was associated with decreased detergent stability of junctional proteins and increased paracellular permeability. Reducing N-glycan branching by specific inhibitors increased (YFP-β₁)-β₁ co-precipitation and strengthened intercellular junctions. Therefore, interactions between the β₁ subunits of neighboring cells maintain integrity of intercellular junctions, and alterations in the β₁ subunit N-glycan structure can regulate stability and tightness of intercellular junctions."
https://openalex.org/W1973398347,"Background A decline in the national maternal mortality ratio in Nepal has been observed from surveys conducted between 1996 and 2008. This paper aims to assess the plausibility of the decline and to identify drivers of change. Methods National and sub-national trends in mortality data were investigated using existing demographic and health surveys and maternal mortality and morbidity surveys. Potential drivers of the variation in maternal mortality between districts were identified by regressing district-level indicators from the Nepal demographic health surveys against maternal mortality estimates. Results A statistically significant decline of the maternal mortality ratio from 539 maternal deaths to 281 per 100,000 (95% CI 91,507) live births between 1993 and 2003 was demonstrated. The sub-national changes are of similar magnitude and direction to those observed nationally, and in the terai region (plains) the differences are statistically significant with a reduction of 361 per 100,000 live births (95% CI 36,686) during the same time period. The reduction in fertility, changes in education and wealth, improvements in components of the human development index, gender empowerment and anaemia each explained more than 10% of the district variation in maternal mortality. A number of limitations in each of the data sources used were identified. Of these, the most important relate to the underestimation of numbers of deaths. Conclusion It is likely that there has been a decline in Nepal's maternal mortality since 1993. This is good news for the country's sustained commitments in this area. Conclusions on the magnitude, pattern of the change and drivers of the decline are constrained by lack of data. We recommend close tracking of maternal mortality and its determinants in Nepal, attention to the communication of future estimates, and various options for bridging data gaps."

Eligible cases were ≥five years old, admitted to health facilities with respiratory symptoms, and had nasopharyngeal/oropharyngeal swab specimens that tested positive for influenza A or B by real-time reverse transcription-PCR. Three randomly selected age-, sex- and neighborhood-matched controls were enrolled per case. A structured questionnaire was administered and home-based HIV testing was performed. Risk factors were evaluated using conditional logistic regression.A total of 64 cases (38 with influenza A and 26 with influenza B) and 190 controls were enrolled. The median age was 16 years (range 5-69 years). Among cases, 24.5% were HIV-infected versus 12.5% of controls (p = 0.004). Among persons ≥18 years old, 13 (59%) of 22 tested cases were HIV-positive compared with 15 (24%) of 62 tested controls (p = 0.005). In multivariable analysis, HIV-infection was associated with hospitalization due to influenza [adjusted Odds Ratio (aOR) 3.56, 95% CI 1.25-10.1]. The mean CD4 count among HIV-infected cases and controls was similar (399 vs. 387, respectively, p = 0.89). Chronic lung disease (aOR 6.83, 95% CI 1.37-34.0) was also associated with influenza hospitalization in multivariable analysis. Active pulmonary tuberculosis was associated with influenza hospitalization in bivariate, but not multivariable, analysis.People with HIV infection and chronic lung disease were at increased risk of hospitalized influenza in rural Kenya. HIV infection is common in many parts of sub-Saharan Africa. Influenza vaccine might prevent severe influenza in these risk groups."
https://openalex.org/W2067395489,"Somatic activating mutations in the Notch1 receptor result in the overexpression of activated Notch1, which can be tumorigenic. The goal of this study is to understand the molecular mechanisms underlying the phenotypic changes caused by the overexpression of ligand independent Notch 1 by using a tetracycline inducible promoter in an in vitro embryonic stem (ES) cells/OP9 stromal cells coculture system, recapitulating normal hematopoiesis. First, an in silico analysis of the promoters of Notch regulated genes (previously determined by microarray analysis) revealed that the motifs recognized by regulatory proteins known to mediate hematopoiesis were overrepresented. Notch 1 does not bind DNA but instead binds the CSL transcription factor to regulate gene expression. The in silico analysis also showed that there were putative CSL binding sites observed in the promoters of 28 out of 148 genes. A custom ChIP-chip array was used to assess the occupancy of CSL in the promoter regions of the Notch1 regulated genes in vivo and showed that 61 genes were bound by activated Notch responsive CSL. Then, comprehensive mapping of the CSL binding sites genome-wide using ChIP-seq analysis revealed that over 10,000 genes were bound within 10 kb of the TSS (transcription start site). The majority of the targets discovered by ChIP-seq belong to pathways that have been shown by others to crosstalk with Notch signaling. Finally, 83 miRNAs were significantly differentially expressed by greater than 1.5-fold during the course of in vitro hematopoiesis. Thirty one miRNA were up-regulated and fifty two were down-regulated. Overexpression of Notch1 altered this pattern of expression of microRNA: six miRNAs were up-regulated and four were down regulated as a result of activated Notch1 overexpression during the course of hematopoiesis. Time course analysis of hematopoietic development revealed that cells with Notch 1 overexpression mimic miRNA expression of cells in a less mature stage, which is consistent with our previous biological characterization."
https://openalex.org/W2013597519,"Amyloid β (Aβ) is generated from the copper- and heparan sulfate (HS)-binding amyloid precursor protein (APP) by proteolytic processing. APP supports S-nitrosylation of the HS proteoglycan glypican-1 (Gpc-1). In the presence of ascorbate, there is NO-catalyzed release of anhydromannose (anMan)-containing oligosaccharides from Gpc-1-nitrosothiol. We investigated whether these oligosaccharides interact with Aβ during APP processing and plaque formation. anMan immunoreactivity was detected in amyloid plaques of Alzheimer (AD) and APP transgenic (Tg2576) mouse brains by immunofluorescence microscopy. APP/APP degradation products detected by antibodies to the C terminus of APP, but not Aβ oligomers detected by the anti-Aβ A11 antibody, colocalized with anMan immunoreactivity in Tg2576 fibroblasts. A 50-55-kDa anionic, sodium dodecyl sulfate-stable, anMan- and Aβ-immunoreactive species was obtained from Tg2576 fibroblasts using immunoprecipitation with anti-APP (C terminus). anMan-containing HS oligo- and disaccharide preparations modulated or suppressed A11 immunoreactivity and oligomerization of Aβ42 peptide in an in vitro assay. A11 immunoreactivity increased in Tg2576 fibroblasts when Gpc-1 autoprocessing was inhibited by 3-β[2(diethylamino)ethoxy]androst-5-en-17-one (U18666A) and decreased when Gpc-1 autoprocessing was stimulated by ascorbate. Neither overexpression of Gpc-1 in Tg2576 fibroblasts nor addition of copper ion and NO donor to hippocampal slices from 3xTg-AD mice affected A11 immunoreactivity levels. However, A11 immunoreactivity was greatly suppressed by the subsequent addition of ascorbate. We speculate that temporary interaction between the Aβ domain and small, anMan-containing oligosaccharides may preclude formation of toxic Aβ oligomers. A portion of the oligosaccharides are co-secreted with the Aβ peptides and deposited in plaques. These results support the notion that an inadequate supply of vitamin C could contribute to late onset AD in humans."

To achieve heterologous expression of [NiFe] hydrogenases in cyanobacteria, the two hydrogenase structural genes from Alteromonas macleodii Deep ecotype (AltDE), hynS and hynL, along with the surrounding genes in the gene operon of HynSL were cloned in a vector with an IPTG-inducible promoter and introduced into Synechococcus elongatus PCC7942. The hydrogenase protein was expressed at the correct size upon induction with IPTG. The heterologously-expressed HynSL hydrogenase was active when tested by in vitro H2 evolution assay, indicating the correct assembly of the catalytic center in the cyanobacterial host. Using a similar expression system, the hydrogenase structural genes from Thiocapsa roseopersicina (hynSL) and the entire set of known accessory genes were transferred to S. elongatus. A protein of the correct size was expressed but had no activity. However, when the 11 accessory genes from AltDE were co-expressed with hynSL, the T. roseopersicina hydrogenase was found to be active by in vitro assay. This is the first report of active, heterologously-expressed [NiFe] hydrogenases in cyanobacteria."
https://openalex.org/W2007426346,"Cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor (CDKN1A), often referred to as p21(Waf1/Cip1) (p21), is induced by a variety of environmental stresses. Transcription factor ELK-1 is a member of the ETS oncogene superfamily. Here, we show that ELK-1 directly trans-activates the p21 gene, independently of p53 and EGR-1, in sodium arsenite (NaASO(2))-exposed HaCaT cells. Promoter deletion analysis and site-directed mutagenesis identified the presence of an ELK-1-binding core motif between -190 and -170 bp of the p21 promoter that confers inducibility by NaASO(2). Chromatin immunoprecipitation and electrophoretic mobility shift analyses confirmed the specific binding of ELK-1 to its putative binding sequence within the p21 promoter. In addition, NaASO(2)-induced p21 promoter activity was enhanced by exogenous expression of ELK-1 and reduced by expression of siRNA targeted to ELK-1 mRNA. The importance of ELK-1 in response to NaASO(2) was further confirmed by the observation that stable expression of ELK-1 siRNA in HaCaT cells resulted in the attenuation of NaASO(2)-induced p21 expression. Although ELK-1 was activated by ERK, JNK, and p38 MAPK in response to NaASO(2), ELK-1-mediated activation of the p21 promoter was largely dependent on ERK. In addition, EGR-1 induced by ELK-1 seemed to be involved in NaASO(2)-induced expression of BAX. This supports the view that the ERK/ELK-1 cascade is involved in p53-independent induction of p21 and BAX gene expression."
https://openalex.org/W2028375501,"Cisplatin along with other platinum based drugs are some of the most widely used chemotherapeutic agents. However drug resistance is a major problem for the successful chemotherapeutic treatment of cancer. Current evidence suggests that drug resistance is a multifactorial problem due to changes in the expression levels and activity of a wide number of proteins. A majority of the studies to date have quantified mRNA levels between drug resistant and drug sensitive cell lines. Unfortunately mRNA levels do not always correlate with protein expression levels due to post-transcriptional changes in protein abundance. Therefore global quantitative proteomics screens are needed to identify the protein targets that are differentially expressed in drug resistant cell lines. Here we employ a quantitative proteomics technique using stable isotope labeling with amino acids in cell culture (SILAC) coupled with mass spectrometry to quantify changes in protein levels between cisplatin resistant (HeLa/CDDP) and sensitive HeLa cells in an unbiased fashion. A total of 856 proteins were identified and quantified, with 374 displaying significantly altered expression levels between the cell lines. Expression level data was then integrated with a network of protein-protein interactions, and biological pathways to obtain a systems level view of proteome changes which occur with cisplatin resistance. Several of these proteins have been previously implicated in resistance towards platinum-based and other drugs, while many represent new potential markers or therapeutic targets."
https://openalex.org/W1981390999,"Background Ras is frequently mutated in a variety of human cancers, including lung cancer, leading to constitutive activation of MAPK signaling. Despite decades of research focused on the Ras oncogene, Ras-targeted phosphorylation events and signaling pathways have not been described on a proteome-wide scale. Methodology/Principal Findings By functional phosphoproteomics, we studied the molecular mechanics of oncogenic Ras signaling using a pathway-based approach. We identified Ras-regulated phosphorylation events (n = 77) using label-free comparative proteomics analysis of immortalized human bronchial epithelial cells with and without the expression of oncogenic Ras. Many were newly identified as potential targets of the Ras signaling pathway. A majority (∼60%) of the Ras-targeted events consisted of a [pSer/Thr]-Pro motif, indicating the involvement of proline-directed kinases. By integrating the phosphorylated signatures into the Pathway Interaction Database, we further inferred Ras-regulated pathways, including MAPK signaling and other novel cascades, in governing diverse functions such as gene expression, apoptosis, cell growth, and RNA processing. Comparisons of Ras-regulated phosphorylation events, pathways, and related kinases in lung cancer-derived cells supported a role of oncogenic Ras signaling in lung adenocarcinoma A549 and H322 cells, but not in large cell carcinoma H1299 cells. Conclusions/Significance This study reveals phosphorylation events, signaling networks, and molecular functions that are regulated by oncogenic Ras. The results observed in this study may aid to extend our knowledge on Ras signaling in lung cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2058524068,"Genome-wide expression data of gene microarrays can be used to infer gene networks. At a cellular level, a gene network provides a picture of the modules in which genes are densely connected, and of the hub genes, which are highly connected with other genes. A gene network is useful to identify the genes involved in the same pathway, in a protein complex or that are co-regulated. In this study, we used different methods to find gene networks in the ciliate Tetrahymena thermophila, and describe some important properties of this network, such as modules and hubs.Using 67 single channel microarrays, we constructed the Tetrahymena gene network (TGN) using three methods: the Pearson correlation coefficient (PCC), the Spearman correlation coefficient (SCC) and the context likelihood of relatedness (CLR) algorithm. The accuracy and coverage of the three networks were evaluated using four conserved protein complexes in yeast. The CLR network with a Z-score threshold 3.49 was determined to be the most robust. The TGN was partitioned, and 55 modules were found. In addition, analysis of the arbitrarily determined 1200 hubs showed that these hubs could be sorted into six groups according to their expression profiles. We also investigated human disease orthologs in Tetrahymena that are missing in yeast and provide evidence indicating that some of these are involved in the same process in Tetrahymena as in human.This study constructed a Tetrahymena gene network, provided new insights to the properties of this biological network, and presents an important resource to study Tetrahymena genes at the pathway level."
https://openalex.org/W2028893516,"Several lines of evidence implicate lipid raft microdomains in Alzheimer disease-associated β-amyloid peptide (Aβ) production. Notably, targeting β-secretase (β-site amyloid precursor protein (APP)-cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1)) exclusively to lipid rafts by the addition of a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor to its ectodomain has been reported to elevate Aβ secretion. Paradoxically, Aβ secretion is not reduced by the expression of non-raft resident S-palmitoylation-deficient BACE1 (BACE1-4C/A (C474A/C478A/C482A/C485A)). We addressed this apparent discrepancy in raft microdomain-associated BACE1 processing of APP in this study. As previously reported, we found that expression of BACE1-GPI elevated Aβ secretion as compared with wild-type BACE1 (WTBACE1) or BACE1-4C/A. However, this increase occurred without any difference in the levels of APP ectodomain released following BACE1 cleavage (soluble APPβ), arguing against an overall increase in BACE1 processing of APP per se. Further analysis revealed that WTBACE1 cleaves APP at β- and β′-sites, generating +1 and +11 β-C-terminal fragments and secreting intact as well as N-terminally truncated Aβ. In contrast, three different BACE1-GPI chimeras preferentially cleaved APP at the β-site, mainly generating +1 β-C-terminal fragment and secreting intact Aβ. As a consequence, cells expressing BACE1-GPI secreted relatively higher levels of intact Aβ without an increase in BACE1 processing of APP. Markedly reduced cleavage at β′-site exhibited by BACE1-GPI was cell type-independent and insensitive to subcellular localization of APP or the pathogenic KM/NL mutant. We conclude that the apparent elevation in Aβ secretion by BACE1-GPI is mainly attributed to preferential cleavage at the β-site and failure to detect +11 Aβ species secreted by cells expressing WTBACE1.

Targeting BACE1 lumenal domain to lipid rafts by the addition of a GPI anchor has been reported to increase Aβ production (19Cordy J.M. Hussain I. Dingwall C. Hooper N.M. Turner A.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2003; 100: 11735-11740Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). Recently, we found that S-palmitoylation at 4 Cys residues (Cys474/Cys478/Cys482/Cys485) in juxtamembrane domain is required for lipid raft association of BACE1 (20Vetrivel K.S. Meckler X. Chen Y.

Surprisingly, displacing BACE1 from the lipid rafts by the Ala mutation of these 4 Cys residues had no influence on APP processing and Aβ production in cultured cell lines (20Vetrivel K.S. Meckler X. Chen Y. Nguyen P.D. Seidah N.G. Vassar R. Wong P.C. Fukata M. Kounnas M.Z. Thinakaran G. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 3793-3803Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). This later finding is in contrast to the data from the analysis of BACE1-GPI chimera, which was thought to increase Aβ production due to its ability to exclusively associate with lipid rafts (19Cordy J.M. Hussain I. Dingwall C. Hooper N.M. Turner A.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2003; 100: 11735-11740Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). To resolve this conundrum, we further explored the mechanism by which the BACE1-GPI elevated Aβ production. We found that, unlike WTBACE1 and BACE1-4C/A (C474/478/482/485A), overexpression of BACE1-GPI increased cleavage at β-site but not at β′-site, resulting in the secretion of increased levels of intact Aβ. However, extensive analysis of cells expressing WTBACE1, non-raft-localized S-palmitoylation-deficient BACE1-4C/A, and predominantly raft-associated BACE1-GPI showed similar levels of sAPPβ secretion into the conditioned medium, establishing no difference in the efficiency of APP processing. Thus, our data reveal that the apparent increase in Aβ production by BACE1-GPI previously attributed to raft-associated APP processing is a result of compromised cleavage at β′-site and the inability to experimentally detect +11 Aβ species.DISCUSSIONWe recently characterized BACE1 S-palmitoylation at 4 Cys residues located in the transmembrane and cytoplasmic boundary and reported that this post-translational modification of BACE1 is required for lipid raft association (20Vetrivel K.S. Meckler X. Chen Y. Nguyen P.D. Seidah N.G. Vassar R. Wong P.C. Fukata M. Kounnas M.Z. Thinakaran G. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 3793-3803Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Because targeting BACE1 to lipid rafts through the attachment of a GPI anchor elevated Aβ secretion, we expected that interfering with raft association of BACE1 by mutation of the palmitoylated Cys residues will lower Aβ secretion. However, displacing BACE1 from lipid raft domains did not affect BACE1 processing of APP and Aβ secretion (20Vetrivel K.S. Meckler X. Chen Y. Nguyen P.D. Seidah N.G. Vassar R. Wong P.C. Fukata M. Kounnas M.Z. Thinakaran G. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 3793-3803Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). In this study, we characterized the paradoxical increase in Aβ secretion associated with expression of BACE1-GPI. We used three different BACE1-GPI constructs, including the BACE1-GPI (carboxypeptidase) construct used in previous characterization of raft-associated APP processing (19Cordy J.M. Hussain I. Dingwall C. Hooper N.M. Turner A.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2003; 100: 11735-11740Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). We report that expression of BACE1-GPI elevated intact Aβ secretion compared with WTBACE1 and BACE1-4C/A. However, this increase in Aβ secretion by BACE1-GPI was not concomitant with release of sAPPβ. Because the level of cellular BACE1 activity is reflected by the amount of sAPPβ secreted in the conditioned medium, this later finding argues against an overall increase in amyloidogenic processing of APP previously attributed to raft association of BACE1-GPI (19Cordy J.M. Hussain I. Dingwall C. Hooper N.M. Turner A.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2003; 100: 11735-11740Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). Instead, our results demonstrate that WTBACE1 and BACE1-4C/A cleaved APP at β- and β′-sites to generate +1 as well as +11 β-CTFs, whereas BACE1-GPI mainly generated +1 β-CTF due to marked loss of APP cleavage at β′-site. Moreover, a significant portion of +1 CTFs was converted to +11 CTFs by β′-site cleavage by WTBACE1, which reduced the levels of intact Aβ secreted by the cells; this conversion occurred at extremely low efficiency in cells expressing BACE1-GP1, allowing efficient secretion of intact Aβ (supplemental Fig. S1). Thus, although expression of BACE1-GPI elevated secretion of intact Aβ as compared with WTBACE1, this difference was not due to enhanced APP processing associated with exclusive raft targeting of BACE1 as was originally described (19Cordy J.M. Hussain I. Dingwall C. Hooper N.M. Turner A.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2003; 100: 11735-11740Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar).In accordance with the previous study that used BACE1-GPI chimera (19Cordy J.M. Hussain I. Dingwall C. Hooper N.M. Turner A.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2003; 100: 11735-11740Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar), we found that replacing the transmembrane domain and cytosolic tail of BACE1 with a GPI anchor motif efficiently targeted BACE1 ectodomain to lipid rafts in HEK293 and mouse N2a neuroblastoma cells. However, we did not observe the reported increase in sAPPβ secretion upon overexpression of BACE1-GPI (19Cordy J.M. Hussain I. Dingwall C. Hooper N.M. Turner A.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Our experiments, which were conducted in multiple cell types, consistently showed that cells expressing BACE1-GPI secreted similar levels of sAPPβ as compared with those expressing WTBACE1 or BACE1-4C/A. It is important to note that an earlier study by Haass and co-workers (21Westmeyer G.G. Willem M. Lichtenthaler S.F. Lurman G. Multhaup G. Assfalg-Machleidt I. Reiss K. Saftig P. Haass C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 53205-53212Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar) independently reported that the level of sAPPβ secretion was indistinguishable between cells expressing WTBACE1 and BACE1-GPI in agreement with our results.It has been shown that BACE1 cleavage at β′-site of APP depends on the level of BACE1 expression (14Creemers J.W. Ines Dominguez D. Plets E. Serneels L. Taylor N.A. Multhaup G. Craessaerts K. Annaert W. De Strooper B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 4211-4217Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). In agreement, the efficiency of cleavage at β′-site correlated well with the level of WTBACE1 overexpression in our studies. However, BACE1-GPI cleaved mainly at β-site of APP with very little cleavage at β′-site even when the chimera was highly overexpressed (Fig. 3). This partial loss of β′-site-specific cleavage by BACE1-GPI was readily apparent in experiments where we expressed APP C100 and a β-site cleavage mutant (M596V). Whereas WTBACE1 cleaved either protein at β′-site, BACE1-GPI failed to do so. Together, these findings reveal an inherent loss of β′-site recognition by BACE1-GPI chimera (Fig. 4C).Following initial attachment to proteins, GPI anchors undergo structural remodeling to generate variability in the side chains and lipid moieties (32Fujita M. Kinoshita T. FEBS Lett. 2010; 584: 1670-1677Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Thus, it is possible that the observed difference in sAPPβ secretion between the studies as well as the reduced cleavage at β′-site discovered in the present study is a unique feature associated with the particular GPI anchor region (from PLAP) that we initially used. To formally rule out this possibility, we performed parallel analysis of BACE1 modified with GPI anchors from PLAP, carboxypeptidase M, and CD59 (19Cordy J.M. Hussain I. Dingwall C. Hooper N.M. Turner A.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2003; 100: 11735-11740Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar, 21Westmeyer G.G. Willem M. Lichtenthaler S.F. Lurman G. Multhaup G. Assfalg-Machleidt I.

Examination of APP processing by BACE1 chimeras with different GPI anchor motifs revealed that all three chimeras exhibited compromised cleavage at β′-site of APP and in each case secreted similar levels of sAPPβ and generated lower levels of +11 β-CTF as compared with WTBACE1 (Fig. 6).In metabolic labeling experiments conducted in stable HEK293 and N2a cells, it was obvious that there was a significant decrease of full-length Aβ with a concomitant increase of +11 Aβ upon overexpression of WTBACE1. An increase in +11 Aβ secretion was observed with APPWT (which is processed predominantly in endocytic organelles) and APPSwe (which is processed during transit in the secretory pathway) (Fig. 5, B–E). The mAb 4G8 used for immunoprecipitation of secreted Aβ-related species in our experiments is capable of reacting with both intact Aβ and N-terminally truncated +11 Aβ, thus permitting us to visualize this conversion. However, +11 Aβ was undetectable when antibodies specific to the N-terminal residues of Aβ were used for detection in immunoblots, immunoprecipitation, or ELISA analysis in this study (Figs. 2A and 5C) as well as in the report by Cordy et al. (19Cordy J.M. Hussain I. Dingwall C. Hooper N.M. Turner A.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2003; 100: 11735-11740Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar).In cultured cells, such as the ones used in this study, the majority of WTBACE1 resides in endocytic organelles and TGN at the steady state, and only a subset of BACE1 resides at the cell surface (11Huse J.T.

Neurosci. 2002; 19: 175-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). On the other hand, GPI-anchored mammalian proteins (32Fujita M. Kinoshita T. FEBS Lett. 2010; 584: 1670-1677Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), including BACE1-GPI, are highly enriched at the plasma membrane and in membrane raft microdomains (Fig. 1). In our studies, there was an ∼3-fold increase in cell surface BACE1 in N2a and HEK293 cells stably expressing BACE1-GPI as compared with WTBACE1 (Fig. 1). Thus, the loss of β′-site cleavage we observed in cells expressing BACE1-GPI could be related to having limited access to a pool of APP substrate that is dynamically transported in secretory or endocytic vesicles. In addition, the relative efficiency of BACE1 cleavage of APP at β- and β′-sites is influenced by the subcellular compartment in which BACE1 resides (13Huse J.T. Liu K. Pijak D.S. Carlin D. Lee V.M. Doms R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 16278-16284Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). For example, retention of BACE1 in ER increases cleavage at β-site, whereas TGN localization promotes cleavage at β′-site (13Huse J.T. Liu K. Pijak D.S. Carlin D. Lee V.M. Doms R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 16278-16284Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). These results were faithfully reproduced in WTBACE1 cells by targeting APP to the ER or TGN by means of organelle targeting signals appended to the C terminus. However, targeting APP to TGN failed to promote cleavage at β′-site by BACE1-GPI (Fig. 8). Similarly, expression of APPΔNPTY, a mutant in which transit of APP through the endocytic pathway is inhibited by the deletion of the NPTY internalization motif, also failed to increase BACE1-GPI processing of APP at β′-site (Fig. 8). These results indicate that markedly reduced cleavage at β′-site is intrinsic to this chimera.The efficiency of cleavage at β- and β′-sites was unaffected by expression of BACE1-HEP, a chimera that contains the transmembrane domain and cytosolic tail of hephaestin fused to BACE1 ectodomain. Thus, the diminished ability of BACE1-GPI to cleave APP at β′-site is not specifically related to the lack of a specific sequence motif encoded within BACE1 transmembrane domain or cytosolic tail sequence. Alternatively, we suggest that dynamic localization of BACE1 in raft and non-raft microdomains confers a certain flexibility to the transmembrane and juxtamembrane region of BACE1, thus allowing the catalytic site to cleave at both β- and β′-sites. Modifying BACE1 with the GPI anchor results in the loss of this structural plasticity, and as a consequence, BACE1-GPI chimera fails to adopt the conformation required to facilitate APP cleavage at β′-site. Molecular modeling of BACE1-GPI chimera supports the idea that the addition of GPI anchor introduces structural changes to BACE1 ectodomain. Specifically, the molecular dynamics simulations show that the GPI anchor introduces significant changes in the positioning of the flap, third strand, and insert F (Fig. 9, A and B). These regions have been implicated in the recognition, positioning (38Hong L. Tang J. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 4689-4695Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar), and entry (39Xiong B. Huang X.Q. Shen L.L. Shen J.H. Luo X.M. Shen X. Jiang H.L. Chen K.X. Acta Pharmacol. Sin. 2004; 25: 705-713PubMed Google Scholar) of the substrates. The elongation of the Cα(Thr72)-Cβ(Asp32) distance by 4.8 Å shows that the flap is substantially more open in BACE1-GPI (supplemental Fig. S2B). This opening could influence the substrate orientation inside the active site and alter the catalytic activity of the enzyme. In BACE1-GPI chimera, the loss of the Glu12 (10s loop)-Ser113 (third strand) hydrogen bond and the formation of additional Asn111 (third strand)-Asp311 (insert F) and Asn111 (third strand)-Gln316 (insert F) bonds bring the third strand and insert F close to each other. This structural rearrangement could also contribute to the observed changes in APP processing. Thus, it is possible that structural alterations introduced in BACE1-GPI chimera position the catalytic site toward the β-site but only allow poor access to β′-site of APP. Indeed, experimental mutagenesis of APP residues located between β- and β′-sites as well as in the juxtamembrane loop region of BACE1 has demonstrated the importance of structural compatibility and spatial orientation for efficient β and β′ cleavage of APP (44Qahwash I. He W. Tomasselli A. Kletzien R.F. Yan R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 39010-39016Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar).Previous studies have demonstrated independent (de novo cleavage at +11) as well as sequential cleavage (+1 followed by +11 cleavage) at β′-site of APP by BACE1 (14Creemers J.W. Ines Dominguez D. Plets E. Serneels L. Taylor N.A. Multhaup G. Craessaerts K. Annaert W. De Strooper B. J. Biol.

Results from β-site cleavage mutant (M596V) and APP C100 demonstrate that either mode of +11 cleavage is compromised in cells expressing BACE1-GPI. Finally, when we expressed a β′-site APP cleavage mutant (E607V) so that we could examine processing at the β-site in the absence of confounding sequential cleavage at β′-site, we observed higher levels of sAPPβ release and increased generation of β-CTF by cells expressing WTBACE1 as compared with BACE1-GPI (Fig. 4C). This finding clearly demonstrates increased efficiency of β-site cleavage of APP by WTBACE1 relative to BACE1-GPI. Therefore, we conclude that elevated Aβ secretion by cells expressing BACE1-GPI is mainly contributed by loss of cleavage at β′-site rather than up-regulation of overall APP processing as a result of predominant raft association of BACE1-GPI chimera. While preparing this manuscript, we learned of a pathogenic early onset Alzheimer disease APP mutation at the β′ cleavage site (E607K (APP695 numbering)) that impaired cleavage at β′-site leading to increased Aβ secretion (46Zhou L.

IntroductionAlzheimer disease is an age-associated neurodegenerative disorder pathologically characterized by the cerebral deposition of 38–42-amino acid-long β-amyloid peptides (Aβ) 2The abbreviations used are: Aββ-amyloid peptide(s)APPamyloid precursor proteinBACE1β-site APP-cleaving enzyme 1 (β-secretase)CTFC-terminal fragmentGPIglycosylphosphatidylinositolPLAPplacental alkaline phosphataseTGNtrans-Golgi networkFLfull lengthHEPhephaestin4C/AC474A/C478A/C482A/C485AsAPPsoluble APPERendoplasmic reticulumTricineN-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycineNHSN-hydroxysulfosuccinimideNavβ2voltage-gated sodium channel β2 subunitAPPSweSwedish variant of APP. in senile plaques. Aβ is generated by the sequential proteolysis of a large type I transmembrane protein, termed amyloid precursor protein (APP), by BACE1 (β-site APP-cleaving enzyme 1) and γ-secretases (1Thinakaran G.

BACE1 is a transmembrane aspartyl protease that cleaves APP within the ectodomain at a major cleavage site between Met596 and Asp597 (β-site or +1 cleavage site) (2Vassar R. Bennett B.D. Babu-Khan S.

BACE1 processing results in the release of the large APP ectodomain (β-cleaved soluble APP (sAPPβ)) and the generation of membrane-tethered C-terminal fragment (CTF), termed β-CTF (6Cole S.L. Vassar R. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 29621-29625Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). In a subsequent step, β-CTF is cleaved within the transmembrane domain by γ-secretase to release Aβ peptides (7Iwatsubo T. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2004; 14: 379-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). In addition to the β-site, BACE1 can also cleave APP within the Aβ domain between Tyr606 and Glu607 (β′-site or +11 cleavage site), releasing sAPPβ′ and +11 β-CTF. In an alternate processing pathway, APP can be cleaved within the Aβ domain between Lys16 and Leu17 by a set of enzymes, termed α-secretases, which release sAPPα and generate α-CTF (1Thinakaran G. Koo E.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 29615-29619Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (827) Google Scholar). γ-Secretase cleavage of +11 β-CTF and α-CTF generates N-terminally truncated Aβ-related peptides found in cerebrospinal fluid and media conditioned by cultured cells, termed +11 Aβ and p3, respectively (8Seubert P.

Recently, we found that S-palmitoylation at 4 Cys residues (Cys474/Cys478/Cys482/Cys485) in juxtamembrane domain is required for lipid raft association of BACE1 (20Vetrivel K.S. Meckler X. Chen Y.

Surprisingly, displacing BACE1 from the lipid rafts by the Ala mutation of these 4 Cys residues had no influence on APP processing and Aβ production in cultured cell lines (20Vetrivel K.S. Meckler X.

This later finding is in contrast to the data from the analysis of BACE1-GPI chimera, which was thought to increase Aβ production due to its ability to exclusively associate with lipid rafts (19Cordy J.M.

To resolve this conundrum, we further explored the mechanism by which the BACE1-GPI elevated Aβ production. We found that, unlike WTBACE1 and BACE1-4C/A (C474/478/482/485A), overexpression of BACE1-GPI increased cleavage at β-site but not at β′-site, resulting in the secretion of increased levels of intact Aβ. However, extensive analysis of cells expressing WTBACE1, non-raft-localized S-palmitoylation-deficient BACE1-4C/A, and predominantly raft-associated BACE1-GPI showed similar levels of sAPPβ secretion into the conditioned medium, establishing no difference in the efficiency of APP processing. Thus, our data reveal that the apparent increase in Aβ production by BACE1-GPI previously attributed to raft-associated APP processing is a result of compromised cleavage at β′-site and the inability to experimentally detect +11 Aβ species."
https://openalex.org/W2167134768,"Background Bacterial DNA contamination in PCR reagents has been a long standing problem that hampers the adoption of broad-range PCR in clinical and applied microbiology, particularly in detection of low abundance bacteria. Although several DNA decontamination protocols have been reported, they all suffer from compromised PCR efficiency or detection limits. To date, no satisfactory solution has been found. Methodology/Principal Findings We herein describe a method that solves this long standing problem by employing a broad-range primer extension-PCR (PE-PCR) strategy that obviates the need for DNA decontamination. In this method, we first devise a fusion probe having a 3′-end complementary to the template bacterial sequence and a 5′-end non-bacterial tag sequence. We then hybridize the probes to template DNA, carry out primer extension and remove the excess probes using an optimized enzyme mix of Klenow DNA polymerase and exonuclease I. This strategy allows the templates to be distinguished from the PCR reagent contaminants and selectively amplified by PCR. To prove the concept, we spiked the PCR reagents with Staphylococcus aureus genomic DNA and applied PE-PCR to amplify template bacterial DNA. The spiking DNA neither interfered with template DNA amplification nor caused false positive of the reaction. Broad-range PE-PCR amplification of the 16S rRNA gene was also validated and minute quantities of template DNA (10–100 fg) were detectable without false positives. When adapting to real-time and high-resolution melting (HRM) analytical platforms, the unique melting profiles for the PE-PCR product can be used as the molecular fingerprints to further identify individual bacterial species. Conclusions/Significance Broad-range PE-PCR is simple, efficient, and completely obviates the need to decontaminate PCR reagents. When coupling with real-time and HRM analyses, it offers a new avenue for bacterial species identification with a limited source of bacterial DNA, making it suitable for use in clinical and applied microbiology laboratories."
https://openalex.org/W2140849994,"Rac1 activity, polarity, lamellipodial dynamics, and directed motility are defective in keratinocytes exhibiting deficiency in β4 integrin or knockdown of the plakin protein Bullous Pemphigoid Antigen 1e (BPAG1e). The activity of Rac, formation of stable lamellipodia, and directed migration are restored in β4 integrin-deficient cells by inducing expression of a truncated form of β4 integrin, which lacks binding sites for BPAG1e and plectin. In these same cells, BPAG1e, the truncated β4 integrin, and type XVII collagen (Col XVII), a transmembrane BPAG1e-binding protein, but not plectin, colocalize along the substratum-attached surface. This finding suggested to us that Col XVII mediates the association of BPAG1e and α6β4 integrin containing the truncated β4 subunit and supports directed migration. To test these possibilities, we knocked down Col XVII expression in keratinocytes expressing both full-length and truncated β4 integrin proteins. Col XVII-knockdown keratinocytes exhibit a loss in BPAG1e-α6β4 integrin interaction, a reduction in lamellipodial stability, an impairment in directional motility, and a decrease in Rac1 activity. These defects are rescued by a mutant Col XVII protein truncated at its carboxyl terminus. In summary, our results suggest that in motile cells Col XVII recruits BPAG1e to α6β4 integrin and is necessary for activation of signaling pathways, motile behavior, and lamellipodial stability."
https://openalex.org/W2092633070,"Quantitative RT-PCR is the method of choice for studying, with both sensitivity and accuracy, the expression of genes. A reliable normalization of the data, using several reference genes, is critical for an accurate quantification of gene expression. Here, we propose a set of reference genes, of the phytopathogenic bacteria Dickeya dadantii and Pectobacterium atrosepticum, which are stable in a wide range of growth conditions.We extracted, from a D. dadantii micro-array transcript profile dataset comprising thirty-two different growth conditions, an initial set of 49 expressed genes with very low variation in gene expression. Out of these, we retained 10 genes representing different functional categories, different levels of expression (low, medium, and high) and with no systematic variation in expression correlating with growth conditions. We measured the expression of these reference gene candidates using quantitative RT-PCR in 50 different experimental conditions, mimicking the environment encountered by the bacteria in their host and directly during the infection process in planta. The two most stable genes (ABF-0017965 (lpxC) and ABF-0020529 (yafS) were successfully used for normalization of RT-qPCR data. Finally, we demonstrated that the ortholog of lpxC and yafS in Pectobacterium atrosepticum also showed stable expression in diverse growth conditions.We have identified at least two genes, lpxC (ABF-0017965) and yafS (ABF-0020509), whose expressions are stable in a wide range of growth conditions and during infection. Thus, these genes are considered suitable for use as reference genes for the normalization of real-time RT-qPCR data of the two main pectinolytic phytopathogenic bacteria D. dadantii and P. atrosepticum and, probably, of other Enterobacteriaceae. Moreover, we defined general criteria to select good reference genes in bacteria."
https://openalex.org/W2094114748,"Background This study examines the impact of subsidies on the profitability and ecological stability of the North Sea fisheries over the past 20 years. It shows the negative impact that subsidies can have on both the biomass of important fish species and the possible profit from fisheries. The study includes subsidies in an ecosystem model of the North Sea and examines the possible effects of eliminating fishery subsidies. Methodology/Principal Findings Hindcast analysis between 1991 and 2003 indicates that subsidies reduced the profitability of the fishery even though gross revenue might have been high for specific fisheries sectors. Simulations seeking to maximise the total revenue between 2004 and 2010 suggest that this can be achieved by increasing the effort of Nephrops trawlers, beam trawlers, and the pelagic trawl-and-seine fleet, while reducing the effort of demersal trawlers. Simulations show that ecological stability can be realised by reducing the effort of the beam trawlers, Nephrops trawlers, pelagic- and demersal trawl-and-seine fleets. This analysis also shows that when subsidies are included, effort will always be higher for all fleets, because it effectively reduces the cost of fishing. Conclusions/Significance The study found that while removing subsidies might reduce the total catch and revenue, it increases the overall profitability of the fishery and the total biomass of commercially important species. For example, cod, haddock, herring and plaice biomass increased over the simulation when optimising for profit, and when optimising for ecological stability, the biomass for cod, plaice and sole also increased. When subsidies are eliminated, the study shows that rather than forcing those involved in the fishery into the red, fisheries become more profitable, despite a decrease in total revenue due to a loss of subsidies from the government."
https://openalex.org/W2130318096,"ClpB is a hexameric chaperone that solubilizes and reactivates protein aggregates in cooperation with the Hsp70/DnaK chaperone system. Each of the identical protein monomers contains two nucleotide binding domains (NBD), whose ATPase activity must be coupled to exert on the substrate the mechanical work required for its reactivation. However, how communication between these sites occurs is at present poorly understood. We have studied herein the affinity of each of the NBDs for nucleotides in WT ClpB and protein variants in which one or both sites are mutated to selectively impair nucleotide binding or hydrolysis. Our data show that the affinity of NBD2 for nucleotides (K(d) = 3-7 μm) is significantly higher than that of NBD1. Interestingly, the affinity of NBD1 depends on nucleotide binding to NBD2. Binding of ATP, but not ADP, to NBD2 increases the affinity of NBD1 (the K(d) decreases from ≈160-300 to 50-60 μm) for the corresponding nucleotide. Moreover, filling of the NBD2 ring with ATP allows the cooperative binding of this nucleotide and substrates to the NBD1 ring. Data also suggest that a minimum of four subunits cooperate to bind and reactivate two different aggregated protein substrates."
https://openalex.org/W2171281465,"The principal factors that lead to proliferation and pluripotency in embryonic stem cells (ESCs) have been vigorously investigated. However, the global network of factors and their full signaling cascade is still unclear. In this study, we found that ECAT11 (L1td1) is one of the ESC-associated transcripts harboring a truncated fragment of ORF-1, a component of theL1 retrotransposable element. We generated an ECAT11 knock-in mouse by replacing its coding region with green fluorescent protein. In the early stage of development, the fluorescence was observed at the inner cell mass of blastocysts and epiblasts. Despite this specific expression, ECAT11-null mice grow normally and are fertile. In addition, ECAT11 was dispensable for both the proliferation and pluripotency of ESCs.We found rapid and robust activation of ECAT11 in fibroblasts after the forced expression of transcription factors that can give rise pluripotency in somatic cells.However, iPS cells could be established from ECAT11-null fibroblasts. Our data demonstrate thedispensability of ECAT11/L1td1 in pluripotency, despite its specific expression."
https://openalex.org/W2090108799,"The evolutionarily conserved Hox family of homeodomain transcription factors plays fundamental roles in regulating cell specification along the anterior posterior axis during development of all bilaterian animals by controlling cell fate choices in a highly localized, extracellular signal and cell context dependent manner. Some studies have established downstream target genes in specific systems but their identification is insufficient to explain either the ability of Hox genes to direct homeotic transformations or the breadth of their patterning potential. To begin delineating Hox gene function in neural development we used a mouse ES cell based system that combines efficient neural differentiation with inducible Hoxb1 expression. Gene expression profiling suggested that Hoxb1 acted as both activator and repressor in the short term but predominantly as a repressor in the long run. Activated and repressed genes segregated in distinct processes suggesting that, in the context examined, Hoxb1 blocked differentiation while activating genes related to early developmental processes, wnt and cell surface receptor linked signal transduction and cell-to-cell communication. To further elucidate aspects of Hoxb1 function we used loss and gain of function approaches in the mouse and chick embryos. We show that Hoxb1 acts as an activator to establish the full expression domain of CRABPI and II in rhombomere 4 and as a repressor to restrict expression of Lhx5 and Lhx9. Thus the Hoxb1 patterning activity includes the regulation of the cellular response to retinoic acid and the delay of the expression of genes that commit cells to neural differentiation. The results of this study show that ES neural differentiation and inducible Hox gene expression can be used as a sensitive model system to systematically identify Hox novel target genes, delineate their interactions with signaling pathways in dictating cell fate and define the extent of functional overlap among different Hox genes."
https://openalex.org/W1966482623,"Background Early postnatal environments may have long-term and potentially irreversible consequences on hypothalamic neurons involved in energy homeostasis. Litter size is an important life history trait and negatively correlated with milk intake in small mammals, and thus has been regarded as a naturally varying feature of the early developmental environment. Here we investigated the long-term effects of litter size on metabolic phenotype and hypothalamic neuropeptide mRNA expression involved in the regulation of energy homeostasis, using the offspring reared from large (10–12) and small (3–4) litter sizes, of Brandt's voles (Lasiopodomys brandtii), a rodent species from Inner Mongolia grassland in China. Methodology/Principal Findings Hypothalamic leptin signaling and neuropeptides were measured by Real-Time PCR. We showed that offspring reared from small litters were heavier at weaning and also in adulthood than offspring from large litters, accompanied by increased food intake during development. There were no significant differences in serum leptin levels or leptin receptor (OB-Rb) mRNA in the hypothalamus at weaning or in adulthood, however, hypothalamic suppressor of cytokine signaling 3 (SOCS3) mRNA in adulthood increased in small litters compared to that in large litters. As a result, the agouti-related peptide (AgRP) mRNA increased in the offspring from small litters. Conclusions/Significance These findings support our hypothesis that natural litter size has a permanent effect on offspring metabolic phenotype and hypothalamic neuropeptide expression, and suggest central leptin resistance and the resultant increase in AgRP expression may be a fundamental mechanism underlying hyperphagia and the increased risk of overweight in pups of small litters. Thus, we conclude that litter size may be an important and central determinant of metabolic fitness in adulthood."
https://openalex.org/W1993676098,"Background Co-infection with herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2) has been associated with increased HIV-1 RNA levels and immune activation, two predictors of HIV-1 progression. The impact of HSV-2 on clinical outcomes among HIV-1 infected pregnant women is unclear. Methods HIV-1 infected pregnant women in Nairobi were enrolled antenatally and HSV-2 serology was obtained. HIV-1 RNA and CD4 count were serially measured for 12–24 months postpartum. Survival analysis using endpoints of death, opportunistic infection (OI), and CD4<200 cells µL, and linear mixed models estimating rate of change of HIV-1 RNA and CD4, were used to determine associations between HSV-2 serostatus and HIV-1 progression. Results Among 296 women, 254 (86%) were HSV-2-seropositive. Only 30 (10%) women had prior or current genital ulcer disease (GUD); median baseline CD4 count was 422 cells µL. Adjusting for baseline CD4, women with GUD were significantly more likely to have incident OIs (adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) 2.79, 95% CI: 1.33–5.85), and there was a trend for association between HSV-2-seropositivity and incident OIs (aHR 3.83, 95% CI: 0.93–15.83). Rate of change in CD4 count and HIV-1 RNA did not differ by HSV-2 status or GUD, despite a trend toward higher baseline HIV-1 RNA in HSV-2-seropositive women (4.73 log10 copies/ml vs. 4.47 log10 copies/ml, P = 0.07). Conclusions HSV-2 was highly prevalent and pregnant HIV-1 infected women with GUD were significantly more likely to have incident OIs than women without GUD, suggesting that clinically evident HSV-2 is a more important predictor of HIV-1 disease progression than asymptomatic HSV-2."
https://openalex.org/W2142272337,"Complex networks serve as generic models for many biological systems that have been shown to share a number of common structural properties such as power-law degree distribution and small-worldness. Real-world networks are composed of building blocks called motifs that are indeed specific subgraphs of (usually) small number of nodes. Network motifs are important in the functionality of complex networks, and the role of some motifs such as feed-forward loop in many biological networks has been heavily studied. On the other hand, many biological networks have shown some degrees of robustness in terms of their efficiency and connectedness against failures in their components. In this paper we investigated how random and systematic failures in the edges of biological networks influenced their motif structure. We considered two biological networks, namely, protein structure network and human brain functional network. Furthermore, we considered random failures as well as systematic failures based on different strategies for choosing candidate edges for removal. Failure in the edges tipping to high degree nodes had the most destructive role in the motif structure of the networks by decreasing their significance level, while removing edges that were connected to nodes with high values of betweenness centrality had the least effect on the significance profiles. In some cases, the latter caused increase in the significance levels of the motifs."
