https://openalex.org/W1625660792,"Forty proteins with polypeptide chains of well characterized molecular weights have been studied by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate following the procedure of Shapiro, Vinuela, and Maizel (Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun., 28, 815 (1967)). When the electrophoretic mobilities were plotted against the logarithm of the known polypeptide chain molecular weights, a smooth curve was obtained. The results show that the method can be used with great confidence to determine the molecular weights of polypeptide chains for a wide variety of proteins."
https://openalex.org/W1500934039,"Abstract A new procedure is described using carboxymethyl cellulose and diethylaminoethyl cellulose columns for the preparation of native α and β chains from human hemoglobin. The chains appeared to be more stable than those obtained by earlier methods and permitted the preparation of modified chains containing meso- and deuterohemes. The kinetics of carbon monoxide binding was determined for proto-, meso-, and deutero-α and β chains by both stopped flow and flash photolysis methods. The kinetic properties of β—SH chains with protoheme are similar to those reported for hemoglobin H, and their rate of reaction with carbon monoxide is more than twice as great as that for α—SH chains."
https://openalex.org/W1554239817,"Previous work has shown that gluconeogenesis from a variety of substrates is stimulated by oleate. This paper reports data on the effect of oleate on tissue levels of coenzyme A derivatives, ketone bodies, citric acid cycle intermediates, and adenine nucleotides in rat livers perfused with alanine, lactate, or pyruvate. The effect of oleate on the activity of the citric acid cycle with lactate as substrate has been assessed from measurements of the oxygen consumption, and the rates of production or utilization of lactate, pyruvate, glucose, acetoacetate, β-hydroxybutyrate, and urea. Oleate increased the acetyl-CoA content of liver, supporting the suggestion that this intermediate is a physiological regulator of pyruvate carboxylase activity. The oxygen uptake of the liver was increased by oleate, while the ATP: ADP ratio was decreased. Since adenine nucleotides are largely extramitochondrial, an increase of ADP in both mitochondrial and extramitochondrial spaces is indicated. Calculations of the energy requirement for gluconeogenesis and fatty acid activation compared with the extra oxygen consumed upon addition of lactate or oleate to the liver provided P:0 ratios in vivo of 2.9 and 2.8, respectively, showing that oleate in vivo has no uncoupling effect. With lactate as substrate, flow rates of 135 and 147 µmioles per 100 g, body weight, per hour through the citric acid cycle were calculated in the absence and presence of oleate. Flux through the pyruvate dehydrogenase step was inhibited 80% by oleate. Despite the fact that oleate addition did not change the activity of the citric acid cycle markedly, the tissue level of α-ketoglutarate decreased with all substrates tested. After oleate addition, the citrate content increased in the presence of lactate or pyruvate, but decreased in the presence of alanine. It is suggested that the observed fall of α-ketoglutarate and rise of citrate occur largely in the cytosol. Assuming equilibrium of NAD dehydrogenases in mitochondria and cytosol, the intracellular distribution of malate and oxalacetate was calculated from tissue β-hydroxybutyrate to acetoacetate and lactate to pyruvate ratios. These calculations indicate that oxalacetate is largely extramitochondrial. In the presence of pyruvate, large concentration gradients of malate from mitochondria to cytosol are established. Control of the citric acid cycle is discussed in relation to changes of known allosteric modulators of citrate synthase and isocitrate dehydrogenase, and possible compartmentation of intermediates. It is concluded that citrate accumulation is regulated by the mitochondrial oxalacetate concentration, which itself is controlled by the pyruvate carboxylase activity and the NAD oxidation-reduction potential. Feedback between the respiratory chain and mitochondrial isocitrate dehydrogenases is mediated by ADP, NADH, and NADPH. It appears that the distribution of citric acid cycle intermediates in the mitochondrial and cytosolic compartments is greatly affected both by the pyruvate supply and the rate of β oxidation."
https://openalex.org/W1600804495,"Sites of cycloheximide action on protein synthesis were examined using a cell-free system prepared from rat liver. If all amino acids or aminoacyl transfer RNA were present at the start of incubation, the system appeared to incorporate 14C-leucine mainly by elongation of peptide chains. Under these conditions, high dose levels of cycloheximide were necessary in order to inhibit incorporation extensively. The inhibition could be prevented by raising the glutathione content of the reaction mixture, and particularly by preliminary incubation of a mixture of transferase I and II with high concentrations of glutathione before adding these enzymes to the system. Other sulfhydryl compounds were also effective in protecting against cycloheximide. It has been concluded that the inhibitory action of cycloheximide on peptide chain elongation involves inactivation of transferase II, an enzyme known to have a sulfhydryl requirement. High concentrations of glutathione were also found to prevent the inhibition of cell-free protein synthesis caused by streptovitacin A, a derivative of cycloheximide, but not inhibition caused by emetine or sparsomycin. If the protein-synthesizing system was first incubated without amino acids or aminoacyl-tRNA, polysomes present at the start of incubation underwent disaggregation. On addition of amino acids at this point, the polysomes became reaggregated and incorporation of 14C-leucine was stimulated, probably by a process involving chain initiation. The response of polysome aggregation and coincident 14C-leucine uptake could be inhibited by low doses of cycloheximide. Furthermore, this inhibitory action of cycloheximide could not be prevented by raising the glutathione content of the medium. This suggests that the action of cycloheximide on polysome aggregation differs from its effect on peptide chain elongation."

https://openalex.org/W1544925906,"Abstract The reaction of methemoglobin with azide and thiocyanate is kinetically complex. The complexity is due to differences in reactivity between the α and β chains, which react independently with azide, each at a characteristic rate. These rates are similar to the rates of reaction of isolated α and β chains with azide. The difference spectra for α and β chains reacting with azide, although similar, are not identical in the Soret region, and these differences can be seen in methemoglobin. Cyanide and fluoride react at the same rate with α and β chains and show a kinetically simple second order reaction with methemoglobin. Nitrite forms a complex with methemoglobin. Its kinetic behavior is like that of azide and thiocyanate, but its affinity for methemoglobin is about 1000 times less than that of azide."
https://openalex.org/W2106363351,"Abstract The rise in fatty acid synthesizing capacity of the liver which is observed on realimentation of fasting rats with a fat-free diet has been studied. The rise to supranormal levels has been shown unequivocally to be the result of adaptive enzyme synthesis. Proof of this was obtained through the demonstration that 14C-leucine is readily incorporated in vivo into the purified fatty acid synthetase complex formed during refeeding. In addition, measurements of the absolute levels of the enzyme in the livers of fasting and refed rats showed drastic changes in the content of this protein complex with changes in nutritional status. Similarly, alloxan diabetic and portacaval-shunted rats exhibited lowered levels of fatty acid synthetase in liver; and insulin treatment of alloxan diabetic animals caused a return of the level of this enzyme toward the normal range. The characteristics of the fatty acid synthetase isolated from the livers of rats refed for varying periods of time after fasting have been investigated. Differences in homogeneity and variation in specific enzyme activity of these preparations were found which correlated with the length of time of refeeding. The significance of these variations is discussed."

Tracer studies indicate that carbons 1, 2, 3 plus 4, and the methyl carbon of α-keto-γ-methylthiobutyric acid gives rise to carbon dioxide, carbon dioxide, ethylene, and methyldisulfide, respectively. Carbons 1, 2 plus 3, and the methyl carbon of methional give rise to formic acid, ethylene, and methyldisulfide, respectively. A chemical mechanism accounting for the production of these products is described in which the peroxidase functions as 1-electron oxidizing agent."

https://openalex.org/W1661553604,"Abstract Acid α-glucosidase has been isolated from cattle liver in ultracentrifugally and electrophoretically homogeneous form and partially characterized. The enzyme has a sedimentation constant of 5.7 S, a diffusion constant of 4.7 x 10-7 cm2. sec-1, and an average molecular weight, as determined by three different methods, of 107,000. The enzyme contains four —SH groups per molecule, and it is progressively inactivated by incubation at pH above 7, the inactivation being prevented by sulfhydryl group reagents. The highly purified enzyme catalyzes the hydrolysis of the α-(1→4) linkages of glycogen, maltose, and a synthetic glycoside (6-bromo-2-naphthyl-α-d-glucopyranoside) with a Km of 28 mg per ml, 1 x 10-2 m, and 4 x 10-3 m, respectively. Moreover, the enzyme hydrolyzes also the α-(1→6)-glucan linkages of dextran and isomaltose. The pH optimum is the same (4.5) for all these activities. Erythritol, Tris, and turanose inhibit the enzyme competitively, the inhibition constants being 2.7 x 10-2 m, 5.0 x 10-3 m, and 1.4 x 10-3 m, respectively."

https://openalex.org/W1594698135,"Abstract Quinaldic acid and 5-methoxyindole-2-carboxylic acid inhibited gluconeogenesis from lactate, but not from fructose in both the intact rat and in the isolated perfused rat liver. In fed rats both inhibitors are glycogenolytic; in fasted rats 5-methoxyindole-2-carboxylic acid caused hypoglycemia and both inhibitors caused severe hypoglycemia in adrenalectomized rats. Treatment of fasted rats with either inhibitor resulted in increased concentrations of plasma nonesterified fatty acids, decreased levels of blood ketone bodies, as well as a decrease in the ratio of β-hydroxybutyrate to acetoacetate, and elevated hepatic concentrations of lactate, pyruvate, phosphoenolpyruvate, and 2- and 3-phosphoglycerate. The hepatic concentrations of malate, citrate, aspartate, triose phosphates, and hexose phosphates were decreased or normal. Lactate and pyruvate accumulated in the blood and kidneys of rats treated with 5-methoxyindole-2-carboxylic acid, but blood and kidney metabolite concentrations remained normal in rats given quinaldic acid. In agreement with Bauman and Hill (Biochemistry, 7, 1322 (1968)) both quinaldic acid and methoxyindolecarboxylate inhibited oxidation and carboxylation of pyruvate by rat liver mitochondria. Octanoate restored both processes in mitochondria treated with either inhibitor and prevented or reversed their inhibition of gluconeogenesis from lactate in the perfused liver. These observations, together with the observed changes in hepatic metabolites of rats treated with methoxyindolecarboxylate or quinaldate, suggest that inhibition of hepatic mitochondrial pyruvate metabolism is responsible for inhibition of gluconeogenesis by both substances."

https://openalex.org/W1576127155,"Abstract The development of a multisyringe and Millipore filter system for separating mitochondria from their incubation medium, then extracting the mitochondria with perchloric acid, has permitted the rapid analysis of extramitochondrial and intramitochondrial intermediates. This technique has also been utilized to measure the intramitochondrial concentrations of malate, ATP, ADP, and phosphoenolpyruvate at various times during an incubation program. It has been shown that P-enolpyruvate formed from malate can attain a maximum concentration of 11 µmoles per g of mitochondria, dry weight. After this concentration is attained, additional P-enolpyruvate that is synthesized is passed rapidly out of the mitochondria and increases only the extramitochondrial concentration of that intermediate."

https://openalex.org/W1488831417,"Abstract When the citrate cleavage reaction is conducted with 18O-citrate, 1 atom of citrate oxygen is incorporated into each molecule of orthophosphate stemming from ATP. This is consistent with the notion that citryl phosphate is an intermediate of the reaction. Chemically synthesized dl-citryl 1-phosphate is an active substrate of the citrate cleavage enzyme, undergoing stereospecific cleavage in the presence of coenzyme A to oxalacetate and acetyl coenzyme A. Citryl phosphate transfers its citryl group to the enzyme to form citryl enzyme, which is identical in its biochemical properties with the citryl enzyme formed from citrate plus ATP. Citryl phosphate can also transfer its phosphoryl group to the enzyme to form a phosphoprotein which differs in its properties from the phosphoenzyme formed from ATP."

https://openalex.org/W1518700400,"Abstract Adult male rats were given an intraperitoneal injection of 14C-choline or of 14C-acetate. At subsequent intervals the livers from two rats were removed and pooled, and the microsomes, whole mitochondria, outer mitochondrial membrane, and inner mitochondrial membrane fractions were prepared. The specific radioactivity of lecithin and of phosphatidylethanolamine isolated from each of these fractions was measured. At the beginning of each experiment (10 min after injection) specific radioactivity was highest and similar in the microsomes and outer membrane, almost zero in the inner membrane, and of an intermediate value in the whole mitochondria. Maximal incorporation of choline into the microsomes, outer membrane, and whole mitochondria occurred 6 hours after injection of the precursor while maximal incorporation of choline into the inner membrane occurred at 12 hours, i.e. about 6 hours later than in the other three fractions. Incorporation of acetate into the microsomes and outer membrane was maximal during the first 6 hours while that into the whole mitochondria was maximal 6 hours after injection. Maximal incorporation of acetate into the inner membrane occurred after 6 hours in the system acetate → phosphatidylethanolamine and after 6 to 12 hours in the system acetate → lecithin. In all fractions in each experiment, the specific radioactivity fell rapidly after maximal incorporation. The decline appeared to be most rapid in the inner membrane, least rapid in the outer membrane and microsomes, and of an intermediate value in the whole mitochondria. The data in vivo obtained are fully consistent with the results of prior studies in vitro which have established that the phospholipid synthesizing system or systems in mitochondria are associated with the outer and not with the inner membrane. These observations are discussed in relation to the origin of mitochondrial phospholipids, to mitochondrial turnover, and to membrane biosynthesis."
https://openalex.org/W1512832979,"Abstract Rat liver, kidney, pancreas, and small intestine have enzymes which hydrolyze fatty acid esters of carnitine. The liver enzyme, located in the microsomal fraction, was solubilized by sonic disruption and purified 18-fold by diethylaminoethyl cellulose chromatography and Sephadex gel filtration. The purified enzyme sedimented in the ultracentrifuge as a single protein with an s20,w of 4.5 S. The enzyme had maximum activity at pH 7.5 and hydrolyzed higher fatty acid (C6 to C18) esters of l-carnitine. d-Carnitine esters were not hydrolyzed. Esters of dl-carnitine were hydrolyzed only about one-half as efficiently as those of the l isomer. The enzyme did not hydrolyze palmitoyl coenzyme A, p-nitrophenyl palmitate, glycerol tripalmitate, and cholesterol palmitate, but it catalyzed the hydrolysis of glycerol monopalmitate to a slight extent. Among the l-carnitine esters, maximum rate of hydrolysis was obtained with the decanoate ester. The Km for decanoate ester was 3.2 x 10-3 m and for the palmitate ester 5 x 10-3 m. The enzyme was not affected by l-carnitine, dl-carnitine, d-carnitine, ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid, and Mg++ but it was inhibited by decanoyl-d-carnitine, Ca++, Cu++, NaF, sulfhydryl reagents, and sodium cholate, and it was activated by bovine serum albumin. The properties of carnitine ester hydrolase which distinguish it from microsomal esterase and microsomal lipase are discussed."

https://openalex.org/W2003998044,"RECENTLY it has been shown1,2 that the active component of Statolon, an antiviral agent isolated from 5 day old culture filtrates of Penicillium stoloniferum (strain American Type Culture Collection—ATCC 14586), is double stranded RNA of viral origin, and not a complex polysaccharide as originally suggested3. During this investigation it was discovered that Statolon contained three discrete polysaccharides, readily separable by high voltage paper electrophoresis: a heteroglycan, containing galacturonic acid, galactose, xylose, arabinose and rhamnose; a glucan of the amylopectin–glycogen type (unpublished results of K. W. B., E. B. C. and J. M. Tyler) and a polymer of galactosamine, derived from lysis of the fungal cell wall. We now report that galactosamine is a major constituent of the cell wall of the virus-containing strain of P. stoloniferum (ATCC 14586); in contrast, cell walls of four naturally occurring virus-free* strains of P. stoloniferum (ATCC 10111, Commonwealth Mycological Institute 31200, 91960 and 92219) and a virus-free* isolate (ATCC 14586 B3/1) derived from the infected strain by heat treatment of spores1 contained only very small amounts of galactosamine.

Thyrotropin increases the specific activity of lipid 32P uniformly without altering that of ATP-γ-32P, indicating that it exerts its effect at a step beyond ATP in the sequence of phospholipid biosynthesis. There was no significant effect of thyrotropin on the ATP content of thyroid slices."
