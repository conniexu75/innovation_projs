https://openalex.org/W2973290848,"Eukaryotic chromatin is highly condensed but dynamically accessible to regulation and organized into subdomains. We demonstrate that reconstituted chromatin undergoes histone tail-driven liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) in physiologic salt and when microinjected into cell nuclei, producing dense and dynamic droplets. Linker histone H1 and internucleosome linker lengths shared across eukaryotes promote phase separation of chromatin, tune droplet properties, and coordinate to form condensates of consistent density in manners that parallel chromatin behavior in cells. Histone acetylation by p300 antagonizes chromatin phase separation, dissolving droplets in vitro and decreasing droplet formation in nuclei. In the presence of multi-bromodomain proteins, such as BRD4, highly acetylated chromatin forms a new phase-separated state with droplets of distinct physical properties, which can be immiscible with unmodified chromatin droplets, mimicking nuclear chromatin subdomains. Our data suggest a framework, based on intrinsic phase separation of the chromatin polymer, for understanding the organization and regulation of eukaryotic genomes."

Here, gnotobiotic mice were colonized with a defined consortium of human-gut-derived bacterial strains and fed different combinations of 34 food-grade fibers added to a representative low-fiber diet consumed in the United States. Bioactive carbohydrates in fiber preparations targeting particular Bacteroides species were identified using community-wide quantitative proteomic analyses of bacterial gene expression coupled with forward genetic screens. Deliberate manipulation of community membership combined with administration of retrievable artificial food particles, consisting of paramagnetic microscopic beads coated with dietary polysaccharides, disclosed the contributions of targeted species to fiber degradation. Our approach, including the use of bead-based biosensors, defines nutrient-harvesting strategies that underlie, as well as alleviate, competition between Bacteroides and control the selectivity of MDF components."
https://openalex.org/W2973570598,"The ability to sense sour provides an important sensory signal to prevent the ingestion of unripe, spoiled, or fermented foods. Taste and somatosensory receptors in the oral cavity trigger aversive behaviors in response to acid stimuli. Here, we show that the ion channel Otopetrin-1, a proton-selective channel normally involved in the sensation of gravity in the vestibular system, is essential for sour sensing in the taste system. We demonstrate that knockout of Otop1 eliminates acid responses from sour-sensing taste receptor cells (TRCs). In addition, we show that mice engineered to express otopetrin-1 in sweet TRCs have sweet cells that also respond to sour stimuli. Next, we genetically identified the taste ganglion neurons mediating each of the five basic taste qualities and demonstrate that sour taste uses its own dedicated labeled line from TRCs in the tongue to finely tuned taste neurons in the brain to trigger aversive behaviors."

Here, using a combination of crystallography, cryo-electron microscopy, and biochemical and in vivo studies on the Saccharomyces cerevisiae NPC system (NCR1 and NPC2), we present a framework for sterol membrane integration. Sterols are transferred between hydrophobic pockets of vacuolar NPC2 and membrane-protein NCR1. NCR1 has its N-terminal domain (NTD) positioned to deliver a sterol to a tunnel connecting NTD to the luminal membrane leaflet 50 Å away. A sterol is caught inside this tunnel during transport, and a proton-relay network of charged residues in the transmembrane region is linked to this tunnel supporting a proton-driven transport mechanism. We propose a model for sterol integration that clarifies the role of NPC proteins in this essential eukaryotic pathway and that rationalizes mutations in patients with Niemann-Pick disease type C.

Sterols are an essential component of membranes in all eukaryotic cells. In humans, Niemann-Pick type C proteins NPC1 and NPC2 bind cholesterol and are essential for lysosomal membrane integration from where cholesterol is redistributed to other cellular membranes (Carstea et al., 1997Carstea E.D.

Disturbance of this pathway leads to Niemann-Pick disease type C, a neurodegenerative disease where cholesterol and other lipids accumulate in the lysosomes (Pentchev, 2004Pentchev P.G. Niemann-Pick C research from mouse to gene.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1685: 3-7Google Scholar). Furthermore, NPC1 has been identified as a key virulence factor for the Filoviruses Ebola and Marburg (Carette et al., 2011Carette J.E. Raaben M. Wong A.C. Herbert A.S. Obernosterer G. Mulherkar N.

Small molecule inhibitors reveal Niemann-Pick C1 is essential for Ebola virus infection.Nature. 2011; 477: 344-348Google Scholar). The molecular mechanism of sterol membrane integration is still unclear, despite having been studied extensively. NPC2, a soluble intra-lysosomal protein, binds sterols with distinct polarity (polar head group exposed and aliphatic tail buried in the cavity) and is able to hand off this sterol to the luminal N-terminal domain (NTD) of the lysosomal membrane protein NPC1 with reversed polarity (polar head group buried in the pocket) (Deffieu and Pfeffer, 2011Deffieu M.S.

Through an unknown mechanism, the sterol bound to the NTD is then believed to be passed to the lysosomal membrane for integration (Davies and Ioannou, 2000Davies J.P. Ioannou Y.A.

Several sterol binding sites have been suggested in NPC1, and sterol integration into the membrane involves a membrane-buried sterol sensing domain (SSD), but the structural and functional relationship between these sites in NPC proteins remains unknown (Lu et al., 2015Lu F.

The luminal side of the lysosomal membrane is covered in an ∼60 Å thick glycocalyx, a polysaccharide matrix coating that preserves the integrity of the lysosomal membrane protecting the cytosol from degradative enzymes inside the lysosome lumen (Neiss, 1984Neiss W.F. A coat of glycoconjugates on the inner surface of the lysosomal membrane in the rat kidney.Histochemistry. 1984; 80: 603-608Google Scholar). It has been speculated that NPC1 could help sterols bypass this protective layer (Gong et al., 2016Gong X. Qian H. Zhou X. Wu J. Wan T. Cao P. Huang W. Zhao X. Wang X.

In yeast, the degradation process of the lysosome is delegated to the vacuole (Schulze et al., 2009Schulze H. Kolter T. Sandhoff K.

The yeast NPC system (NCR1 and NPC2) shares 32% and 22% sequence identity with the human system (hNPC1 and hNPC2, respectively), but there is no structural framework to relate NCR1 and NPC2 to their human counterparts at the molecular level (Figures S1 and S2A).Figure S2Sequence Alignment and Crystal Structures of S. cerevisiae NPC2, Related to Figure 1Show full caption(A) Alignment between NPC2 (UniProt: Q12408), and hNPC2 (UniProt: P61916), based on a multiple sequence alignment in Promals3D followed by small manual adjustments based on structural comparison.

Clues to the mechanism of sterol uptake can be found in the cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structure of the full-length hNPC1 (Gong et al., 2016Gong X. Qian H. Zhou X. Wu J. Wan T. Cao P. Huang W. Zhao X. Wang X. Wang P. et al.Structural Insights into the Niemann-Pick C1 (NPC1)-Mediated Cholesterol Transfer and Ebola Infection.Cell. 2016; 165: 1467-1478Google Scholar), the crystal structure of a large fragment of hNPC1 without the NTD (Li et al., 2016aLi X. Wang J. Coutavas E. Shi H. Hao Q. Blobel G. Structure of human Niemann-Pick C1 protein.Proc Natl Acad Sci USA. 2016; 113: 8212-8217Google Scholar), and the crystal structure of the middle luminal domain (MLD) of hNPC1 bound to hNPC2 (Li et al., 2016bLi X.

USA. 2016; 113: 10079-10084Google Scholar). Furthermore, recent breakthroughs in the related Patched protein family belonging to the same Resistance-Nodulation-Division (RND) superfamily as NPC1 proteins also provide hints toward a possible common core mechanism, since Patched is involved in a reverse process of sterol extraction from the membrane (Gong et al., 2018Gong X.

Despite this, we do not have a clear understanding of how NPC1 and NPC2 mediate transfer of sterols into the lysosomal membrane, and several different models currently co-exist (Li et al., 2016aLi X.

Goldstein J.L. Lu F. Lysosomal cholesterol export reconstituted from fragments of Niemann-Pick C1.eLife. 2018; 7 (Published online July 26, 2018)https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.38564Google Scholar). Here, we present four structures of yeast NCR1 and NPC2. The crystal structure of NPC2 is solved in both a sterol-free and sterol-bound state. We measure sterol binding affinities and demonstrate that sterol transfer is possible between NPC2 and the NTD of NCR1. We show that one physiological function of NPC2 and NCR1 is to deliver sterols to the vacuole in living yeast cells, in analogy to the human system. The structures of NPC2 rationalize how sterols are captured and shuttled in the yeast vacuole, and they display an expanded binding site compared to its human counterpart indicative of a broader substrate range. We also present the first crystal structure, as well as the first single-particle cryo-EM structure, of NCR1. Both structures adopt a novel conformation not observed in the human NPC1. We identify a tunnel through the central core of NCR1 that links the NTD with the SSD and in which we observe a bound sterol. Based on our data, we propose a mechanism for sterol transport where NCR1 can bypass the glycocalyx via a tunnel to mediate sterol insertion into the membrane. The model explains puzzling results in the field related to the number of sterol binding sites, and it offers a rationale for why the sterol polarity switch from NPC2 to NTD is necessary for proper membrane integration in vivo. Our data suggest that the molecular mechanism of sterol transfer and sterol membrane integration is conserved from fungi to humans and offers a rationale for missense mutations found in patients with Niemann-Pick disease type C. We expressed, purified, and crystallized S. cerevisiae NPC2 (Figure S2B; see also Table S1). The sterol-free form of NPC2 is determined by experimental phasing to 2.8 Å (Rfree 26.2%) with 3 identical monomers (root-mean-square deviation, RMSD(CA) < 0.33 Å) in the asymmetric unit forming a trimer with 120 degree rotational symmetry. In the crystal packing, a propeptide (residue 24–34) from one monomer of the trimer extends to fold over a neighboring monomer from another trimer (Figure S2C). The NPC2 monomer adopts an open Ig-like beta sandwich fold with seven anti-parallel beta strands (Figure 1A). Strand 1, 2, and 5 form one side of the sandwich, while strand 3, 4, 6, and 7 form the other. A small alpha helix between strand 4 and 5 forms a cover (residues 109–123) enclosing part of a deep and elongated hydrophobic cavity (1,019 Å3) between the two sides of the sandwich, leaving space for substrate entry and exit at only one end of the sandwich. Two disulfide bonds and a single N-linked glycosylation stabilize the structure. The structure of NPC2 in complex with sterols was determined to 2.9 Å (Rfree 25.7%) (Figures 1B and S2D; see also Table S1). The asymmetric unit contains 9 monomers forming 3 trimers similar to the trimer in the sterol-free structure, but without the propeptide interaction between trimers (Figure S2E). A single ergosterol molecule is found in the hydrophobic binding cavity in 5 of the monomers, while the remaining 4 monomers have strong density features in the binding cavity that cannot be confidently classified but appear to be bulkier than ergosterol and may be other lipids (Figure S2F and S2G). The sterol polarity within the cavity is such that the polar head group points out and the aliphatic tail into the cavity in the same orientation as observed in previous human and bovine NPC2 structures (Figure S2H) (Li et al., 2016bLi X. Saha P. Li J. Blobel G. Pfeffer S.R. Clues to the mechanism of cholesterol transfer from the structure of NPC1 middle lumenal domain bound to NPC2.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2016; 113: 10079-10084Google Scholar, Xu et al., 2007Xu S. Benoff B. Liou H.-L. Lobel P. Stock A.M. Structural basis of sterol binding by NPC2, a lysosomal protein deficient in Niemann-Pick type C2 disease.J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 23525-23531Google Scholar). The sterol resides in a hydrophobic cavity lined by the side chains of Pro67, Leu73, Val95, Leu102, Leu103, Ile138, Val142, Tyr147, Val149, Val168, and Phe170, some of which form non-specific hydrophobic interactions between NPC2 and the sterol (Figure 1C). The cavity is of sufficient size that two sterols could fit side by side in the opening, but such a setup is not supported by the observed density (Figures S2G and S2I). There is no difference in conformation of sterol-free and sterol-bound NPC2 (RMSD(CA) < 0.3 Å) (Figure 1B), similar to the bovine sterol-free versus sterol-bound NPC2 (Xu et al., 2007Xu S. Benoff B. Liou H.-L. Lobel P. Stock A.M. Structural basis of sterol binding by NPC2, a lysosomal protein deficient in Niemann-Pick type C2 disease.J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 23525-23531Google Scholar). While yeast NPC2 has a similar sandwich fold and almost identical binding of a single sterol as human and bovine NPC2, the global structure displays significant differences (e.g., to bovine sterol-bound form RMSD(CA) 3.0 Å) (Figure S2H). NPC2 has a much larger binding cavity compared to human and bovine NPC2 because it lacks a disulfide bond that in the human and bovine NPC2 pushes the beta sandwich together opposite the sterol binding site. Furthermore, multiple bulky side chains are facing the cavity in both human and bovine NPC2 but not in yeast NPC2, reducing the size of these cavities (e.g., bovine NPC2 cavity: 186 Å3) (Figures 1D). Despite this, the observed sterol binding site in all three is very similar with respect to position and orientation of the sterol, with a small difference being a slight tilt of the sterol in yeast NPC2 compared to bovine and human NPC2 (Figure 1E). It has previously been shown that yeast NPC2 can rescue human NPC2-deficient fibroblasts (Berger et al., 2005bBerger A.C. Vanderford T.H. Gernert K.M. Nichols J.W. Faundez V. Corbett A.H. Saccharomyces cerevisiae Npc2p is a functionally conserved homologue of the human Niemann-Pick disease type C 2 protein, hNPC2.Eukaryot. Cell. 2005; 4: 1851-1862Google Scholar), and we can now rationalize this, as essential components of sterol binding are conserved between yeast NPC2 and human NPC2. To establish the binding properties of the yeast NPC system, we assayed binding affinities of NPC2 and the NTD of NCR1 using two different approaches: (1) fluorescence-detected resonance energy transfer (FRET) from aromatic residues to an intrinsically fluorescent ergosterol analog, dehydroergosterol (DHE), and (2) binding of radiolabeled cholesterol. When exciting NPC2 at 280 nm, sterol binding can be detected as fluorescence of DHE emitting between 360 and 400 nm with three characteristic peaks (Figure S3A). This FRET effect from NPC2’s Tyr and Phe shows that DHE binds to NPC2 with nanomolar affinity (Kd = 121 nM) (Figure 2A). Using radiolabeled cholesterol in a different experimental setup, we observe a binding affinity in the same nanomolar range (Kd = 591 nM) (Figure 2B). Binding competition assays show that the antifungal lipid edelfosine interferes strongly with cholesterol binding, while the hNPC1 inhibitor U18666A and the cholesterol trafficking inhibitor Cepharanthine inhibit binding more weakly (Figure 2C). In combination with the large binding cavity observed in the crystal structure, these data suggest that yeast NPC2 could be involved in general hydrophobic substrate trafficking, but this needs to be investigated further in order to identify which substrates it shuttles.Figure 2Sterol Affinity of NPC2 and NTD and Sterol Transfer AssaysShow full caption(A) FRET signal shows NPC2 binds dehydroergosterol (DHE) with a Kd = 121 ± 75 nM.

https://openalex.org/W2973501556,"Dysregulation of neuronal excitability underlies the pathogenesis of tauopathies, including frontotemporal dementia (FTD) with tau inclusions. A majority of FTD-causing tau mutations are located in the microtubule-binding domain, but how these mutations alter neuronal excitability is largely unknown. Here, using CRISPR/Cas9-based gene editing in human pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived neurons and isogenic controls, we show that the FTD-causing V337M tau mutation impairs activity-dependent plasticity of the cytoskeleton in the axon initial segment (AIS). Extracellular recordings by multi-electrode arrays (MEAs) revealed that the V337M tau mutation in human neurons leads to an abnormal increase in neuronal activity in response to chronic depolarization. Stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy of human neurons with this mutation showed that AIS plasticity is impaired by the abnormal accumulation of end-binding protein 3 (EB3) in the AIS submembrane region. These findings expand our understanding of how FTD-causing tau mutations dysregulate components of the neuronal cytoskeleton, leading to network dysfunction."
https://openalex.org/W2974514979,"The gastrointestinal tract is enveloped by concentric and orthogonally aligned layers of smooth muscle; however, an understanding of the mechanisms by which these muscles become patterned and aligned in the embryo has been lacking. We find that Hedgehog acts through Bmp to delineate the position of the circumferentially oriented inner muscle layer, whereas localized Bmp inhibition is critical for allowing formation of the later-forming, longitudinally oriented outer layer. Because the layers form at different developmental stages, the muscle cells are exposed to unique mechanical stimuli that direct their alignments. Differential growth within the early gut tube generates residual strains that orient the first layer circumferentially, and when formed, the spontaneous contractions of this layer align the second layer longitudinally. Our data link morphogen-based patterning to mechanically controlled smooth muscle cell alignment and provide a mechanistic context for potentially understanding smooth muscle organization in a wide variety of tubular organs."
https://openalex.org/W2974029161,"Cellular senescence is a mechanism used by mitotic cells to prevent uncontrolled cell division. As senescent cells persist in tissues, they cause local inflammation and are harmful to surrounding cells, contributing to aging. Generally, neurodegenerative diseases, such as Parkinson's, are disorders of aging. The contribution of cellular senescence to neurodegeneration is still unclear. SATB1 is a DNA binding protein associated with Parkinson's disease. We report that SATB1 prevents cellular senescence in post-mitotic dopaminergic neurons. Loss of SATB1 causes activation of a cellular senescence transcriptional program in dopamine neurons both in human stem cell-derived dopaminergic neurons and in mice. We observed phenotypes that are central to cellular senescence in SATB1 knockout dopamine neurons in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, we found that SATB1 directly represses expression of the pro-senescence factor p21 in dopaminergic neurons. Our data implicate senescence of dopamine neurons as a contributing factor in the pathology of Parkinson's disease."
https://openalex.org/W2977182596,"Methods have been developed for Mendelian randomization that can obtain consistent causal estimates under weaker assumptions than the standard instrumental variable assumptions. The median-based estimator and MR-Egger are examples of such methods. However, these methods can be sensitive to genetic variants with heterogeneous causal estimates. Such heterogeneity may arise from over-dispersion in the causal estimates, or specific variants with outlying causal estimates. In this paper, we develop three extensions to robust methods for Mendelian randomization with summarized data: 1) robust regression (MM-estimation); 2) penalized weights; and 3) Lasso penalization. Methods using these approaches are considered in two applied examples: one where there is evidence of over-dispersion in the causal estimates (the causal effect of body mass index on schizophrenia risk), and the other containing outliers (the causal effect of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol on Alzheimer's disease risk). Through an extensive simulation study, we demonstrate that robust regression applied to the inverse-variance weighted method with penalized weights is a worthwhile additional sensitivity analysis for Mendelian randomization to provide robustness to variants with outlying causal estimates. The results from the applied examples and simulation study highlight the importance of using methods that make different assumptions to assess the robustness of findings from Mendelian randomization investigations with multiple genetic variants."

Allogenic transplantation of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) currently constitutes the only curative treatment for bone marrow failure (BMF) characteristic of Fanconi anemia (FA) patients (Ebens et al., 2017Ebens C.L.

Correction of patients’ HSPCs by gene therapy is a promising therapeutic alternative to allogeneic transplantation due to the proliferative advantage associated with the correction of mutated FA genes. This phenomenon was first observed in mosaic patients in whom secondary mutations in FA genes restored the function of mutated alleles (Gross et al., 2002Gross M. Hanenberg H. Lobitz S. Friedl R.

In these patients, compensatory mutations occurring in HSPCs resulted in the expansion of the reverted clones, leading to the correction of FA-patient hematopoiesis (Asur et al., 2018Asur R.S.

Somatic mosaicism was thus proposed as a natural gene therapy process, suggesting that the correction of a low number of HSCs could be sufficient to restore the hematopoiesis of FA patients. Using an ex vivo lentiviral-mediated gene therapy approach, we have recently demonstrated that corrected CD34+ cells from FA patients also develop in vivo proliferative advantage in transplanted immunodeficient mice, mimicking the behavior of reverted FA HSCs (Río et al., 2017Río P.

Aiming at the precise insertion of therapeutic FA genes, in previous studies we developed homologous recombination (HR)-mediated gene therapy approaches that facilitated the integration of a healthy copy of FANCA in the “safe harbor” AAVS1 locus of FA-A cells, initially in fibroblasts (Río et al., 2014Río P.

(2) NHEJ constitutes the preferential mechanism for the repair of double-strand breaks (DSBs) in primitive HSCs (Naka and Hirao, 2011Naka K. Hirao A. Maintenance of genomic integrity in hematopoietic stem cells.Int. J. Hematol. 2011; 93: 434-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). (3) Compared to HR, the efficacy of NHEJ is enhanced in FA cells (Du et al., 2016Du W. Amarachintha S. Wilson A.F. Pang Q. Hyper-active non-homologous end joining selects for synthetic lethality resistant and pathological Fanconi anemia hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells.Sci. Rep. 2016; 6: 22167Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, Pace et al., 2010Pace P. Mosedale G. Hodskinson M.R. Rosado I.V. Sivasubramaniam M. Patel K.J. Ku70 corrupts DNA repair in the absence of the Fanconi anemia pathway.Science. 2010; 329: 219-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Although NHEJ is an error-prone DSB-repair mechanism that has been mainly used for gene knockout, this pathway could also be positively exploited to generate compensatory mutations that may restore FANCA functions, mimicking natural reversions described in mosaic FA patients. We thus hypothesized that the generation of insertion and/or deletion (indel) events in the vicinity of pathogenic mutations might constitute a gene-editing approach that would be particularly efficient for correcting the phenotype of HSCs from patients with FA. Due to the efficiency and versatility of the CRISPR/Cas9 system (Ran et al., 2013Ran F.A. Hsu P.D. Wright J. Agarwala V. Scott D.A. Zhang F. Genome engineering using the CRISPR-Cas9 system.Nat. Protoc. 2013; 8: 2281-2308Crossref PubMed Scopus (6461) Google Scholar), we focused on this technology to investigate the efficacy of NHEJ to correct the phenotype of human FA hematopoietic cells harboring mutations in genes encoding for FA proteins involved in different steps of the FA pathway. Our results show for the first time the feasibility of conducting NHEJ-editing-mediated correction of FA lymphoblastic cell lines (LCLs) from different complementation groups. Additionally, we demonstrate that this approach also confers phenotypic correction and proliferative advantage in CD34+ cells from FA-A patients without compromising the repopulating properties of the self-renewing HSCs, suggesting that this very simple and versatile gene-editing approach should have a marked impact in the therapy of several monogenic diseases affecting the hematopoietic system. In a first set of experiments, we investigated whether NHEJ could be exploited to correct FA-A cells with a biallelic insertion of a single nucleotide (c.3558insG) in exon 36 of FANCA. This insertion produces a 28-amino-acid frameshift, generating a premature stop codon (p.R1187EfsX28) (Castella et al., 2011Castella M. Pujol R. Callén E. Trujillo J.P. Casado J.A. Gille H. Lach F.P. Auerbach A.D. Schindler D. Benítez J. et al.Origin, functional role, and clinical impact of Fanconi anemia FANCA mutations.Blood. 2011; 117: 3759-3769Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Notably, the spontaneous reversion of this mutation has been observed in several mosaic FA patients (Waisfisz et al., 1999Waisfisz Q. Morgan N.V. Savino M. de Winter J.P. van Berkel C.G. Hoatlin M.E. Ianzano L. Gibson R.A. Arwert F. Savoia A. et al.Spontaneous functional correction of homozygous fanconi anaemia alleles reveals novel mechanistic basis for reverse mosaicism.Nat. Genet. 1999; 22: 379-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar), suggesting that slight variations in this FANCA domain could preserve the protein function. Two different small guide RNAs (sgRNAs) were cloned separately into the all-in-one pX330 plasmid (Table S1) and electroporated in a FA-A patient LCL (FA-178) carrying the FANCA c.3558insG mutation in homozygosis (Table S2). Since the gINS11 generated a higher indel rate in FA-178 cells (data not shown), this sgRNA was selected for further experiments. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) analysis performed 5 days after gINS11 electroporation showed the occurrence of potentially therapeutic frame-restoring NHEJ-repair events at a frequency of 7.62%, while non-therapeutic indels occurred less frequently (2.32%) (Figure 1A). To determine whether the putative therapeutic indels restored the functionality of the gene, different approaches were conducted. First, cells were maintained in culture and NGS analyses were performed at day 30 of incubation. These analyses showed a marked enrichment of therapeutic indels (from 7.62% to 16.45%), mainly due to the expansion of the 3′-guanine deletion immediately adjacent to the Cas9 cutting site (c.3579delG), while other indels disappeared (Figure 1A, right charts). This observation revealed that not all potentially therapeutic indels conferred proliferative advantage, suggesting that the open reading frame (ORF) restoration may not be sufficient to recover gene function. Protein BLAST analyses demonstrated the highly conserved nature of FANCA exon 36, confirming that c.3579delG was the only therapeutic indel that did not disrupt this conserved domain (Figure S1). Western blot analysis showed the restored expression of FANCA protein in edited cells (Figure 1B). Moreover, since FANCA is essential for FANCD2 recruitment to damaged DNA, FANCD2 immunofluorescence analyses were conducted in edited and unedited FA-178 cells to confirm the functionality of this newly expressed FANCA protein. As shown in Figure 1C, edited cells displayed evident FANCD2 foci, particularly after exposure to mitomycin C (MMC), mimicking the behavior of healthy donor (HD) LCLs, thus confirming the restoration of the FA pathway in FA-A cells. To further demonstrate the correction of the FA-phenotype, edited cells were cultured in the presence of increasing doses of MMC. While unedited FA-178 LCL showed the characteristic hypersensitivity of FA cells to MMC, edited cells showed a marked increase in the resistance to this drug, behaving as HD cells (Figure 1D). Importantly, the correction of the chromosomal instability induced by diepoxibutane (DEB), a hallmark of FA, was also demonstrated in edited FA-178 cells both by analyses of chromosomal breaks (Figure 1E) and by the generation of micronuclei in these cells (Figure S2A). Finally, because the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) is increased in FA cells (Joenje et al., 1981Joenje H. Arwert F. Eriksson A.W. de Koning H. Oostra A.B. Oxygen-dependence of chromosomal aberrations in Fanconi’s anaemia.Nature. 1981; 290: 142-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar), we also analyzed differences in ROS production between edited and untreated FA-178 cells. The fluorogenic test showed a significant reduction in ROS levels in edited compared to unedited cells (Figure S2B). Neither NGS sequencing nor functional studies in unedited FA-178 (cultured in parallel to edited cells) showed evidence of spontaneous reversion of the c.3558insG mutation (not shown). This observation, together with the presence of editing events exclusively in the region that is close to the Cas9 cleavage site discarded spontaneous reversion of edited cells. Taken together, these studies demonstrated the restored FA pathway and phenotypic correction of a FA-A LCL using a simple NHEJ-editing approach. To confirm the efficacy of NHEJ to restore the function of FANCA mutations, we focused on the most frequent mutation described in FA patients from Spain. This mutation consists of a homozygous c.295C > T substitution in exon 4 that generates a premature stop codon, thus leading to a truncated, non-functional FANCA protein (p.Q99X) (Castella et al., 2011Castella M. Pujol R. Callén E. Trujillo J.P. Casado J.A. Gille H. Lach F.P. Auerbach A.D. Schindler D. Benítez J. et al.Origin, functional role, and clinical impact of Fanconi anemia FANCA mutations.Blood. 2011; 117: 3759-3769Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). This is a challenging mutation since the therapeutic NHEJ-mediated editing of these cells would require both the removal of the premature stop codon and also the preservation of the ORF, without disrupting any functional domain of FANCA. In contrast to the c.3558insG mutation, the reversion of c.295C > T has not been reported in FA patients (Callén et al., 2005Callén E. Casado J.A. Tischkowitz M.D. Bueren J.A. Creus A. Marcos R. Dasí A. Estella J.M. Muñoz A. Ortega J.J. et al.A common founder mutation in FANCA underlies the world’s highest prevalence of Fanconi anemia in Gypsy families from Spain.Blood. 2005; 105: 1946-1949Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). As conducted with the c.3558insG mutation, two different sgRNAs were tested in patient-derived LCL (FA-55), both of which rendered a similar efficiency to generate indels in this target site of FANCA (around 30%) (Figures 2A and S3A). As expected from the complexity of the c.295C > T mutation, the initial frequency of therapeutic events was markedly lower (0.41% for gGM10 and 0.29% for gGM4; Figures 2A and S3A, respectively) as compared to efficacies observed in the LCL harboring the c.3558insG mutation (7.62%; Figure 1A). Nevertheless, 237- and 170-fold increases in the proportion of edited cells were observed 60 days after electroporation of FA-A LCLs with gGM10 and gGM4 nucleases, respectively (Figures 2A and S3A). Increases were even higher, when edited LCLs were expanded in the presence of MMC (Figure S3A). NGS analyses showed that the proliferative advantage observed in these cells was mainly due to 30- and 33-bp deletions that were respectively generated with the gGM10 (c.289_318del30) and gGM4 (c.293_325del33) nucleases (Figures 2A and S3A, right panels). Strikingly, the frequency of other non-therapeutic indels was also increased over time (Figure 2A, red color). The Sanger sequencing of individual cell clones clarified that, while one of the FANCA alleles had been repaired by therapeutic NHEJ, the other allele harbored a non-therapeutic NHEJ-repair event (Figure S3B) that was expanded in parallel to the therapeutic indel, explaining the expansion of those non-therapeutic events. Western blot analyses in edited FA-55 LCL pools and in seven edited clones confirmed the re-expression of FANCA, regardless of the therapeutic indel that occurred in these cells (Figures 2B and S3C). As previously observed with the c.3558insG mutation, the newly expressed FANCA protein in FA-55 cells was functional. This was deduced from many different phenotypic analyses carried out in edited cells, which evidenced restored formation of FANCD2 foci (Figure 2C), increased resistance to MMC (Figure 2D), reduced chromosomal fragility upon DEB challenge (Figure 2E; Figure S3D), and reduced ROS levels in edited cells (Figures S3E). To improve the editing efficiency to target this challenging mutation, the CRISPR/Cas9 delivery system was modified. Instead of using a plasmid system, a ribonucleoprotein complex (RNP) composed of a chemically modified sgRNA4 containing, 2′-O-methyl 3′phosphorothioate (MS-sgRNA4) and Cas9 protein was used. As a result, the total frequency of indels, and also of potentially therapeutic indels were markedly increased (2.8- and 5.1-fold increase, respectively; Figure 2F, left chart) compared to values obtained with the plasmid Cas9 system (Figure S3A). Furthermore, the design of a new sgRNA (gGM0) that targets FANCA upstream and near the mutation (Table S1) markedly increased the frequency of therapeutic indels (up to 17.5-fold increase with respect to plasmid system; Figures 2F, right chart, S3F and S3G). These results demonstrate that NHEJ-mediated gene editing can be efficiently used for the generation of compensatory mutations capable of rescuing the function of FANCA, not only in easy-to-repair but also in complex FANCA mutations. To study the feasibility of using NHEJ editing to correct mutations in other FA complementation groups, LCLs with mutations in other FA genes were selected. Particularly we used cells harboring mutations in genes encoding for proteins that participate in different complexes of the FA pathway: upstream (FANCB, FANCC), intermediate FA-D2/I (FANCD2), and downstream (BRCA2) (Table S2). A unique sgRNA was designed per mutation, prioritizing the score and the proximity to the mutation (Table S1). In all instances, RNP complexes including the MS-sgRNAs and the Cas9 protein (MS-RNPs) were electroporated in the different LCLs. As shown in Figure 3, average editing efficiencies in all the FA LCLs were 74.39% ± 8.15%, with potential therapeutic indels ranging from 18.65% to 31.08%, measured by NGS 5 days after nucleofection. In all instances, the percentage of cells with potentially therapeutic indels was increased when edited cells were incubated, in either the absence or the presence of MMC, suggesting the correction of the pathogenic mutation. Importantly, the analysis of MMC sensitivity confirmed in all cases the correction of the characteristic MMC hypersensitivity of FA-B, FA-C, FA-D2, and FA-D1 cells after NHEJ editing (Figure 3, right panels). These results confirm that NHEJ-mediated repair is a simple and efficient system to correct mutations in different FA complementation groups, including cells with mutations in FANCD1/BRCA2, characterized by a marked defect in HR. Once we demonstrated that NHEJ corrected the phenotype of LCLs from different FA patients’ complementation groups, we investigated the feasibility of using this strategy to edit FANCA in human HSCs, which is the preferential target population for the hematopoietic treatment of FA patients. To evaluate whether the NHEJ editing of FANCA was compatible with the preservation of the repopulating properties of human HSCs, initial experiments were conducted in which HD cord blood CD34+ cells were electroporated with a RNP composed by the Cas9 protein complexed with either an in vitro-transcribed sgRNA4 (IVT-RNP4) or with a chemically modified version of this guide (MS-RNP4). As shown in Figure 4A, a much higher percentage of indels was observed when the MS-RNP4 nuclease was used (87.8% ± 4.8% indels), as compared with the IVT sgRNA (13.2% ± 10.2% indels). Notably, the analysis in different hCD34+ subpopulations showed similar editing efficiencies in all cases, even in the very primitive CD34+CD133+CD90+ precursors, suggesting that NHEJ editing efficiently targets the self-renewing HSCs (Figure 4B). To corroborate these results and to investigate the impact of the gene editing mediated by the MS-RNP4 nuclease in long-term repopulating HSCs, transplantation studies were conducted in immunodeficient mice. Since the targeting of FANCA with this nuclease might generate not only monoallelic but also biallelic DSBs in this gene, these experiments would also allow us to investigate in parallel, the repopulating properties of human HSCs from the same donor harboring unedited or edited HSCs, either in one or the two FANCA alleles. Thus, based on the recessive nature of the disease, edited cells harboring two biallelic truncating mutations in FANCA would behave as FA-like cells. Analysis of the percentage of human cells (hCD45+ cells) in primary recipients that had been transplanted with either MS-RNP4-nucleofected cells (MS-RNP4), or the two control groups, not nucleofected (control) and mock-nucleofected cells (mock), showed very high and similar levels of engraftment. In all instances, levels of engraftment in the BM of transplanted mice ranged between 70% and 85% (Figure 4C) and showed similar levels of engraftment in the different hematopoietic subpopulations (Figures 4C and S4A–S4C). Moreover, re-transplants carried out in secondary recipients confirmed the long-term repopulating and multi-lineage differentiation ability of MS-RNP4-nucleofected cells (Figures 4D, S4D, and S4F). However, in these secondary recipients, lower though non-significantly different levels of engraftment were observed in the MS-RNP4 group (16.8% ± 12.2% CD45+ cells in BM), as compared to the control (44.1% ± 31.5%) and mock (36.1% ± 26.9%) groups (Figures 4D), probably due to the generation of biallelic mutations in a percentage of transplanted HSCs (see details in Figure 5). To comparatively investigate the efficiency of NHEJ editing mediated by the MS-RNP4 nuclease in hematopoietic committed progenitor cells, versus primitive HSCs that repopulated the hematopoiesis of immunodeficient mice, NGS analyses were carried out in samples corresponding to Figure 4, both in the bulk of CD34+ cells prior to transplantation and also in human hematopoietic cells that repopulated the BM of primary and secondary recipients (Figure 5A). Although in most cases no significant differences were observed in indel levels in the bulk population of CD34+ cells (87.8% ± 4.8% indels) and in long-term repopulating cells (57.97% ± 34.22%), a decreasing trend was observed. For this reason, we investigated the frequency of the different type of editing events found in the pool of CD34+ cells compared to those observed in the BM cells. Two different types of FANCA-editing events may take place in these cells: in-frame indels (potentially non-pathogenic) or truncating indels (which would result in a FA-like cell phenotype in cells harboring biallelic mutations) (Figure 5B). Interestingly, the frequency of truncating indels was markedly decreased after transplantation, suggesting that many of these truncating mutations took place in both alleles of the repopulating cells. In marked contrast with this observation, the frequency of in-frame indels observed in the pool of CD34+ cells was maintained in cells that repopulated either primary or secondary recipients. Sanger sequencing of human hematopoietic colonies generated by nucleofected cells, either before or after transplantation, allowed us to deeply investigate the different phenotypes of the respective progenitor cells: FA-like, thus carrying biallelic truncating mutations in FANCA or HD-like edited cells carrying at least one WT allele or one allele harboring an in-frame indel. Such in-frame indels could thus be potentially therapeutic if generated in FA cells, as will be described in experiments corresponding to Figures 6 and 7. Remarkably, the majority of the colonies generated by electroporated CD34+ cells harbored editing events (97.2%), most of which resulted in an FA-like phenotype (74.6%), while 22.6% of the edited colonies consisted of HD-like cells (Figure 5C). In clear contrast to this observation, the repertoire of editing events markedly changed when clonogenic assays were generated by human progenitors that repopulated primary or secondary recipients. In these colonies, the HD-like cells were the predominant populations, while the presence of FA-like cells almost completely disappeared, consistent with the repopulating defect of FA cells, and thus with the proliferative advantage of edited HD-like cells. Strikingly, the increase in the percentage of unedited cells in vivo was also higher than HD-like cells, suggesting that some of the in-frame indels generated in HD-like cells were not “neutral” mutations and thus not as efficient in terms of repopulation as the WT sequence.Figure 7In Vivo Proliferative Advantage of mPB HSPCs from a FA-A Patient after NHEJ-Mediated Gene EditingShow full"
https://openalex.org/W2975342415,"Obesity and its comorbidities are currently considered an epidemic, and the involved pathophysiology is well studied. Hypercaloric diets are tightly related to the obesity etiology and also cause alterations in gut microbiota functionality. Diet and antibiotics are known to play crucial roles in changes in the microbiota ecosystem and the disruption of its balance; therefore, the manipulation of gut microbiota may represent an accurate strategy to understand its relationship with obesity caused by diet. Fecal microbiota transplantation, during which fecal microbiota from a healthy donor is transplanted to an obese subject, has aroused interest as an effective approach for the treatment of obesity. To determine its success, a multiomics approach was used that combined metagenomics and metaproteomics to study microbiota composition and function. To do this, a study was performed in rats that evaluated the effect of a hypercaloric diet on the gut microbiota, and this was combined with antibiotic treatment to deplete the microbiota before fecal microbiota transplantation to verify its effects on gut microbiota-host homeostasis. Our results showed that a high-fat diet induces changes in microbiota biodiversity and alters its function in the host. Moreover, we found that antibiotics depleted the microbiota enough to reduce its bacterial content. Finally, we assessed the use of fecal microbiota transplantation as a complementary obesity therapy, and we found that it reversed the effects of antibiotics and reestablished the microbiota balance, which restored normal functioning and alleviated microbiota disruption. This new approach could be implemented to support the dietary and healthy habits recommended as a first option to maintain the homeostasis of the microbiota."

Here we establish mosaic analysis by dual recombinase-mediated cassette exchange (MADR), which permits stable labeling of mutant cells expressing transgenic elements from precisely defined chromosomal loci. We provide a toolkit of MADR elements for combination labeling, inducible and reversible transgene manipulation, VCre recombinase expression, and transgenesis of human cells. Further, we demonstrate the versatility of MADR by creating glioma models with mixed reporter-identified zygosity or with “personalized” driver mutations from pediatric glioma. MADR is extensible to thousands of existing mouse lines, providing a flexible platform to democratize the generation of somatic mosaic mice.Video AbstracteyJraWQiOiI4ZjUxYWNhY2IzYjhiNjNlNzFlYmIzYWFmYTU5NmZmYyIsImFsZyI6IlJTMjU2In0.eyJzdWIiOiJlMDE2ZTc4NTYyMDc3MGQyZGRlNjk2ZDA5ODRjNTMwMCIsImtpZCI6IjhmNTFhY2FjYjNiOGI2M2U3MWViYjNhYWZhNTk2ZmZjIiwiZXhwIjoxNjc4ODA2ODYxfQ.kS5EG-9tVwUmDMtbytqRbgRYuiU-U4SMeEgd8h_8Dh1cxHIICP2sp5HZZsp5siioZJSVWsbx5iPzFEYFIccfyjY9v0JJ4HIEW11KQQZcxJPGi2fssW9sdE9s-4qUA7-_YddizKfm_7nsaBalRAQM3g7VF8Afk5bBwrNO2HGu6ds9cFcdgcd8RemhpxQWtyDT6JMaE6xvObUjXOJJ4YqoHpd9fLGA0hA3c_DPRmzTFF4wJZqDZhiQieqt57d8FptZYjxmq0cprwqir2yPMX8odqI8k1kWqDrZiZu8ujOhaG6arxDn9z6sU5S3JdFeNGy7ihTQkR4vcrKoN2xDnrlB7w(mp4, (63.94 MB) Download video"
https://openalex.org/W2973315785,"Many types of cancers have a well-established dependence on glutamine metabolism to support survival and growth, a process linked to glutaminase 1 (GLS) isoforms. Conversely, GLS2 variants often have tumor-suppressing activity. Triple-negative (TN) breast cancer (testing negative for estrogen, progesterone, and Her2 receptors) has elevated GLS protein levels and reportedly depends on exogenous glutamine and GLS activity for survival. Despite having high GLS levels, we verified that several breast cancer cells (including TN cells) express endogenous GLS2, defying its role as a bona fide tumor suppressor. Moreover, ectopic GLS2 expression rescued cell proliferation, TCA anaplerosis, redox balance, and mitochondrial function after GLS inhibition by the small molecule currently in clinical trials CB-839 or GLS knockdown of GLS-dependent cell lines. In several cell lines, GLS2 knockdown decreased cell proliferation and glutamine-linked metabolic phenotypes. Strikingly, long-term treatment of TN cells with another GLS-exclusive inhibitor bis-2′-(5-phenylacetamide-1,3,4-thiadiazol-2-yl)ethyl sulfide (BPTES) selected for a drug-resistant population with increased endogenous GLS2 and restored proliferative capacity. GLS2 was linked to enhanced in vitro cell migration and invasion, mesenchymal markers (through the ERK-ZEB1-vimentin axis under certain conditions) and in vivo lung metastasis. Of concern, GLS2 amplification or overexpression is linked to an overall, disease-free and distant metastasis-free worse survival prognosis in breast cancer. Altogether, these data establish an unforeseen role of GLS2 in sustaining tumor proliferation and underlying metastasis in breast cancer and provide an initial framework for exploring GLS2 as a novel therapeutic target."
https://openalex.org/W2975722525,"Introduction Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) is a complex genetic condition characterized by hyperphagia, hypotonia, low muscle mass, excess body fat, developmental delays, intellectual disability, behavioral problems, and growth hormone deficiency. This study evaluated the safety and efficacy of orally administered Diazoxide Choline Controlled-Release Tablets (DCCR) in subjects with PWS. Method This was a single-center, Phase II study and included a 10-week Open-Label Treatment Period during which subjects were dose escalated, followed by a 4-week Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled Treatment Period. Results Five female and eight male overweight or obese, adolescent and adult subjects with genetically-confirmed PWS with an average age of 15.5±2.9 years were enrolled in the study. There was a statistically significant reduction in hyperphagia at the end of the Open-Label Treatment Period (-4.32, n = 11, p = 0.006). The onset of effect on hyperphagia was rapid and greater reductions in hyperphagia were seen in subjects with moderate to severe Baseline hyperphagia (-5.50, n = 6, p = 0.03), in subjects treated with the highest dose (-6.25, n = 4, p = 0.08), and in subjects with moderate to severe Baseline hyperphagia treated with the highest dose (-7.83, n = 3, p = 0.09). DCCR treatment resulted in a reduction in the number of subjects displaying aggressive behaviors (-57.1%, n = 10, p = 0.01), clinically-relevant reductions in fat mass (-1.58 kg, n = 11, p = 0.02) and increases in lean body mass (2.26 kg, n = 11, p = 0.003). There was a corresponding decrease in waist circumference, and trends for improvements in lipids and insulin resistance. The most common adverse events were peripheral edema and transient increases in glucose. Many of the adverse events were common medical complications of PWS and diazoxide. Conclusion DCCR treatment appears to address various unmet needs associated with PWS, including hyperphagia and aggressive behaviors in this proof-of-concept study. If the results were replicated in a larger scale study, DCCR may be a preferred therapeutic option for patients with PWS."
https://openalex.org/W2977061492,"Neuropeptides are a class of bioactive peptides shown to be involved in various physiological processes, including metabolism, development, and reproduction. Although neuropeptide candidates have been predicted from genomic and transcriptomic data, comprehensive characterization of neuropeptide repertoires remains a challenge owing to their small size and variable sequences. De novo prediction of neuropeptides from genome or transcriptome data is difficult and usually only efficient for those peptides that have identified orthologs in other animal species. Recent peptidomics technology has enabled systematic structural identification of neuropeptides by using the combination of liquid chromatography and tandem mass spectrometry. However, reliable identification of naturally occurring peptides using a conventional tandem mass spectrometry approach, scanning spectra against a protein database, remains difficult because a large search space must be scanned due to the absence of a cleavage enzyme specification. We developed a pipeline consisting of in silico prediction of candidate neuropeptides followed by peptide-spectrum matching. This approach enables highly sensitive and reliable neuropeptide identification, as the search space for peptide-spectrum matching is highly reduced. Nematostella vectensis is a basal eumetazoan with one of the most ancient nervous systems. We scanned the Nematostella protein database for sequences displaying structural hallmarks typical of eumetazoan neuropeptide precursors, including amino- and carboxyterminal motifs and associated modifications. Peptide-spectrum matching was performed against a dataset of peptides that are cleaved in silico from these putative peptide precursors. The dozens of newly identified neuropeptides display structural similarities to bilaterian neuropeptides including tachykinin, myoinhibitory peptide, and neuromedin-U/pyrokinin, suggesting these neuropeptides occurred in the eumetazoan ancestor of all animal species."

They respond better to chemo- and radio-therapy, and have a better stage specific prognosis. To establish their prevalence in China, we assessed a series of histology confirmed HNSCCs collected in Zhejiang and Guangdong provinces by PCR for HPV DNA and by immunohistochemistry for p16 protein status. Among 303 HNSCCs, HPV DNA was detected in 26.4%, with HPV16 DNA in 71% of these. Of HNSCC located in the oropharynx, 38.55% (32/83) were HPV+ve. In this series, p16 status was a relatively poor predictor of HPV status as detected by PCR. The stage specific survival time of HPV+ HNSCCs was significantly longer than for HPV- HNSCC. HPV status should be assessed for oropharyngeal cancers in China to assist with appropriate management, and prophylaxis against HPV infection should be considered to reduce the incidence of this disease."
https://openalex.org/W2974165200,"The serine/threonine Protein Phosphatase 2A (PP2A) functions as a tumor suppressor by negatively regulating multiple oncogenic signaling pathways. The canonical PP2A holoenzyme comprises a scaffolding subunit (PP2A Aα/β), which serves as the platform for binding of both the catalytic C subunit and one regulatory B subunit. Somatic heterozygous missense mutations in PPP2R1A, the gene encoding the PP2A Aα scaffolding subunit, have been identified across multiple cancer types, but the effects of the most commonly mutated residue, Arg-183, on PP2A function have yet to be fully elucidated. In this study, we used a series of cellular and in vivo models and discovered that the most frequent Aα R183W mutation formed alternative holoenzymes by binding of different PP2A regulatory subunits compared with wild-type Aα, suggesting a rededication of PP2A functions. Unlike wild-type Aα, which suppressed tumorigenesis, the R183W mutant failed to suppress tumor growth in vivo through activation of the MAPK pathway in RAS-mutant transformed cells. Furthermore, cells expressing R183W were less sensitive to MEK inhibitors. Taken together, our results demonstrate that the R183W mutation in PP2A Aα scaffold abrogates the tumor suppressive actions of PP2A, thereby potentiating oncogenic signaling and reducing drug sensitivity of RAS-mutant cells."
https://openalex.org/W2973739537,"Associative learning is thought to involve different forms of activity-dependent synaptic plasticity. Although previous studies have mostly focused on learning-related changes occurring at excitatory glutamatergic synapses, we found that associative learning, such as fear conditioning, also entails long-lasting functional and structural plasticity of GABAergic synapses onto pyramidal neurons of the murine basal amygdala. Fear conditioning-mediated structural remodeling of GABAergic synapses was associated with a change in mIPSC kinetics and an increase in the fraction of synaptic benzodiazepine-sensitive (BZD) GABAA receptors containing the α2 subunit without altering the intrasynaptic distribution and overall amount of BZD-GABAA receptors. These structural and functional synaptic changes were partly reversed by extinction training. These findings provide evidence that associative learning, such as Pavlovian fear conditioning and extinction, sculpts inhibitory synapses to regulate inhibition of active neuronal networks, a process that may tune amygdala circuit responses to threats."

A better understanding of the molecular mechanisms that lead to dementia is expected to reveal potentially modifiable risk factors that could contribute to the development of prevention strategies. Alzheimer’s disease is the most prevalent form of dementia. Currently we only partially understand some of the pathophysiological mechanisms that lead to development of the disease in aging individuals. In this study, Switch Miner software was used to identify key switch genes in the brain whose expression may lead to the development of Alzheimer’s disease. The results indicate that switch genes are enriched in pathways involved in the proteasome, oxidative phosphorylation, Parkinson’s disease, Huntington’s disease, Alzheimer’s disease and metabolism in the hippocampus and posterior cingulate cortex. Network analysis identified the krupel like factor 9 (KLF9), potassium channel tetramerization domain 2 (KCTD2), Sp1 transcription factor (SP1) and chromodomain helicase DNA binding protein 1 (CHD1) as key transcriptional regulators of switch genes in the brain of AD patients.

https://openalex.org/W2976294948,"The wealth of information deliverable from transcriptome sequencing (RNA-seq) is significant, however current applications for variant detection still remain a challenge due to the complexity of the transcriptome. Given the ability of RNA-seq to reveal active regions of the genome, detection of RNA-seq SNPs can prove valuable in understanding the phenotypic diversity between populations. Thus, we present a novel computational workflow named VAP (Variant Analysis Pipeline) that takes advantage of multiple RNA-seq splice aware aligners to call SNPs in non-human models using RNA-seq data only. We applied VAP to RNA-seq from a highly inbred chicken line and achieved high accuracy when compared with the matching whole genome sequencing (WGS) data. Over 65% of WGS coding variants were identified from RNA-seq. Further, our results discovered SNPs resulting from post transcriptional modifications, such as RNA editing, which may reveal potentially functional variation that would have otherwise been missed in genomic data. Even with the limitation in detecting variants in expressed regions only, our method proves to be a reliable alternative for SNP identification using RNA-seq data.

Here, using recombinantly expressed and purified proteins, site-directed mutagenesis, and RNA cleavage and protein cross-linking assays, we investigated Hfq-independent RNA decay by RNase E. Exploring its RNA substrate preferences in the absence of Hfq, we observed that RNase E preferentially cleaves AU-rich sites of single-stranded regions of RNA substrates that are annealed to an sRNA that contains a monophosphate at its 5′-end. We further found that the quaternary structure of RNase E is also important for complete, Hfq-independent cleavage at sites both proximal and distal to the sRNA-binding site within target RNAs containing monophosphorylated 5′-ends. Of note, genetic RNase E variants with unstable quaternary structure exhibited decreased catalytic activity.

The RNase E-NTH has been shown to contain a catalytic activity domain for RNA cleavage, including a specific RNA binding site and a cleavage site (9McDowall K.J. Cohen S.N.

The S1 RNA-binding domain in the large domain forms a sensing pocket for the 5′-terminus of monophosphorylated RNA and an arginine-rich RNA-binding channel for single-stranded RNA (16Kaberdin V.R.

RNase E is active toward single-stranded RNA substrates (or targets) containing a 5′-monophosphate and cleaves at the AU-rich sequences that are several nucleotides apart from the 5′-terminus (19McDowall K.J.

Once the 5′-end of the target RNA substrates is recognized by RNase E, conformational changes are triggered that organize active sites and stimulate cleavage rates, leading to the RNA cleavage cascade. Small noncoding RNA have been shown to be involved in the regulation of mRNA stability and degradation of trans-encoded target mRNA in conjunction with RNase E (22Desnoyers G. Bouchard M.P. Massé E.

Small guide RNA (sRNA) range from 50 to 300 nucleotides and contain a short segment of 7–12 bp with a cognate region in the target mRNA referred to as the “seed pairing” sequence. This is analogous to the cognate binding of microRNA in eukaryotes (10Bandyra K.J. Said N. Pfeiffer V. Górna M.W. Vogel J. Luisi B.F.

Bacterial sRNAs usually repress translation of target mRNA by base-pairing with regions adjacent to or upstream of the ribosome-binding site, resulting in the blocking of ribosome entry and concomitant stimulation of the rapid decay of mRNA by a RNA degradosome (22Desnoyers G.

Bacterial sRNA also positively regulate gene expression by pairing with mRNA; several sRNAs have been shown to activate the translation of the σ factor RpoS by relieving the inhibitory secondary structure of the rpoS mRNA leader form in the presence of the RNA chaperone Hfq protein (26Soper T.

The sRNA-induced mRNA decay is facilitated by the formation of the ternary complex of RNase E, sRNA, and sRNA chaperone Hfq that protects sRNA from degradation by RNase E, in which Hfq promotes the annealing of sRNA to mRNA before the involvement of RNase E (25Morita T.

The recruited RNase E in the ternary complex can then efficiently cleave the target RNA at the preferred sites (10Bandyra K.J. Said N. Pfeiffer V. Górna M.W. Vogel J. Luisi B.F.

RNase E initiates RNA decay via two pathways. First, in the 5′-end–dependent pathway, the 5′-monophosphate of the RNA interacts with the 5′-sensor pocket of RNase E, which stimulates the cleavage of the substrate. Thus, RNA is cleaved more efficiently when it is 5′-monophosphorylated, a form that is often generated from primary transcripts by pyrophosphohydrolase RppH or other RNases. The second pathway, direct entry, has been suggested for sRNA-induced mRNA decay, in which mRNA with a single-stranded region and no 5′-monophosphate are degraded by RNase E stimulated with sRNA/mRNA cognate pairing (10Bandyra K.J.

This model envisages that specific signals invoked by a cognate sRNA seed pairing to a certain target RNA sequence would trigger RNase E to cleave at the preferred sites in the mRNA coding sequence. Several studies have shown the presence of sRNA-induced cleavage sites in the coding sequence of target RNAs, including mRNA for sodB, fumA, iscS, and ompD (29Prévost K. Desnoyers G. Jacques J.F.

In addition, controlled cleavage of ompD mRNA by sRNA MicC has been shown to be caused by the recruitment of RNase E activated by a monophosphate group at the 5′-end of the sRNA cognate-pairing seed (10Bandyra K.J. Said N. Pfeiffer V. Górna M.W. Vogel J. Luisi B.F. The seed region of a small RNA drives the controlled destruction of the target mRNA by the endoribonuclease RNase E.Mol.

Because RNase E contains a 5′-monophosphate–sensing pocket that can interact specifically with a 5′-monophosphorylated sRNA, binding of the sRNA to RNase E prompts the cleavage of the mRNA at the preferred sites in the coding sequence of the mRNA (33Garrey S.M.

However, recent studies have shown that RNase E can recognize specific RNA structural elements without requiring the 5′-sensing route (34Bandyra K.J. Wandzik J.M. Luisi B.F. Substrate recognition and autoinhibition in the central ribonuclease RNase E.Mol.

Numerous studies have shown that RNase E and the RNA chaperone Hfq act together in many cases of sRNA-mediated mRNA decay. In contrast, the Hfq RNA chaperone has been shown to not always be required in the RNase E–mediated mRNA degradation process, as mRNA paired with sRNA is sufficient for triggering target mRNA cleavage by RNase E. By varying the pairing status as well as chemical identity of sRNA, we explored the sRNA-induced target RNA degradation by RNase E in the absence of Hfq RNA chaperone. The 5′-monophosphorylated blunt end of the sRNA/target RNA duplex can trigger RNase E to cleave target RNA at the single-stranded region at distal sites, once the sRNA paired with the target RNA is anchored at the 5′-sensing pocket. In the absence of the RNA chaperone Hfq, RNase E with an intact quaternary structure can still cleave target RNA at both the proximal and distal sites to the monophosphorylated 5′-end of sRNA that are base-paired with the target RNA. It has been previously reported that RNase E cleaves single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) with 5′-monophosphate (i.e. 5′-P), but not with 5′-hydroxyl (i.e. 5′-OH) or triphosphate group (15Callaghan A.J. Marcaida M.J. Stead J.A. McDowall K.J. Scott W.G. Luisi B.F. Structure of Escherichia coli RNase E catalytic domain and implications for RNA turnover.Nature. 2005; 437 (16237448): 1187-119110.1038/nature04084Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar, 19McDowall K.J. Kaberdin V.R. Wu S.W. Cohen S.N. Lin-Chao S.

To examine whether the group at the 5′-terminus of the RNA substrate can affect the cleavage activity of RNase E, we tested this general principle using ssRNA with different chemical groups at the 5′-end (Fig. 1A). These experiments used 47- and 25-mer ssRNA substrates containing AU-rich sequences preferable for RNA cleavage by RNase E (35McDowall K.J. Lin-Chao S. Cohen S.N. A+U content rather than a particular nucleotide order determines the specificity of RNase E cleavage.J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269 (7511606): 10790-10796Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The 47- and 25-mer ssRNA substrates that were predicted to be devoid of secondary structure were 32P-labeled either at the 5′-end nucleotides as [γ-32P]ATP or at internal nucleotides as [α-32P]UMP. Radioactive phosphate labeling instead of other fluorescent modifications at the 5′-end was used to ensure that the 5′-sensing pocket in the RNase E catalytic domain was not disturbed. The ssRNAs containing triphosphates at the 5′-end were prepared using in vitro transcription, mimicking authentic mRNA in E. coli. When the 25- and 47-mer ssRNAs with 5′-monophosphate were incubated with recombinant RNase E, digestion products of similar size (shorter than 10 nt) were observed after 30 min of incubation. The substrate RNA cleavage by RNase E required Mg2+ ion, but did not need ATP or ATP hydrolysis energy (i.e. AMP-PNP, nonhydrolyzable ATP analogue). This indicates that RNase E cleaves substrate ssRNA at the AU-rich sequences close to the 5′-end monophosphate regardless of substrate RNA length. In contrast, RNA cleavage patterns were not detected when control ssRNA containing either triphosphates or hydroxyl groups at the 5′-end were used (Fig. 1A). Thus, RNase E senses the chemical status at the 5′-end of substrate RNA, and the 5′-P is a prerequisite for RNA cleavage by RNase E. When the blunt-ended duplex RNA formed by the annealing of the 5′-32P–labeled 47-mer ssRNA (R0) to complementary 5′-32P–labeled 47-mer ssRNA (cR0) was reacted with RNase E, RNA cleavage was not observed (Fig. 1A), indicating that RNase E can cleave only single-stranded regions of RNA substrates harboring 5′-P. In E. coli, target mRNA-paired small RNAs guide and modulate the rates of translation initiation and target mRNA degradation through base-pairing, which is likely facilitated by the RNA chaperone Hfq protein (10Bandyra K.J. Said N. Pfeiffer V. Górna M.W. Vogel J. Luisi B.F. The seed region of a small RNA drives the controlled destruction of the target mRNA by the endoribonuclease RNase E.Mol. Cell. 2012; 47 (22902561): 943-95310.1016/j.molcel.2012.07.015Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). To test whether 5′-monophosphorylated sRNA alone could guide recombinant RNase E to cleave a target RNA in the absence of Hfq, artificial sRNAs (25-mer R1) with 5′-P were designed and annealed to the target RNA (47-mer R0; Fig. 1B). When the duplex RNA substrate consisting of the target RNA and cognate sRNA with 5′-P was incubated with RNase E, the target RNA was readily cleaved by RNase E at the single-stranded region of R0 RNA close to the 5′-end of the sRNA in the absence or presence of Hfq (Fig. 1B). RNA cleavage products shorter than 25 nt were not observed, indicating that the artificial 5′-monophosphorylated sRNA acts in trans to stimulate RNase E–mediated cleavage of the target RNA that is tethered by base-pairing. This result suggests that radioactive bands appearing between 25- and 47-mer result from the partial cleavage of the RNA substrate by RNase E, which is stimulated by 5′-monophosphorylated sRNA, in the absence of Hfq RNA chaperone. In both the case of RNase E alone and RNase E plus Hfq, RNA cleavage products accumulated as a function of time, and product accumulation was quantified and fitted to an exponential function to compare the catalytic efficiency of RNA cleavage (graph in Fig. 1A). The rate for duplex RNA cleavage was 0.20 and 0.12 min−1 for RNase E plus Hfq and RNase E alone, respectively, indicating that there is little statistically significant difference for RNA cleavage by RNase E in the absence and presence of Hfq. Thus, we suggest that 5′-monophosphorylated sRNA and RNase E are sufficient for target RNA cleavage with moderate efficiency, and RNA chaperone Hfq is not a prerequisite for duplex RNA stabilization. Because Hfq did not markedly affect the RNA cleavage activity of RNase E, we examined the effect of Mg2+ ion or ATP when 5′-P sRNA guides target RNA cleavage by RNase E in the absence of Hfq protein. We used duplex RNA substrate (P47R0/P25R1) formed by annealing of 5′-32P–labeled target RNA to the 5′-32P–labeled sRNA for radiometric detection of cleaved target RNA using urea-PAGE. When the duplex RNA substrate was incubated with RNase E in the presence of Mg2+ ion, bands corresponding to partially cleaved duplex RNA were observed (native PAGE in Fig. 2A). Consistent with the results shown in Fig. 1A, RNase E needs neither ATP nor ATP hydrolysis energy for the cleavage of duplexed substrate RNA in the absence of Hfq. RNA products cleaved by RNase E were resolved by heating, and the reaction products were analyzed for the presence of ssRNA components (urea-PAGE in Fig. 2A). RNA cleavage products consisted of shortened target RNA (<47 nt) and 25-mer sRNA, suggesting that RNase E cleaved single-stranded regions in the target RNA complementary to the 5′-monophosphorylated sRNA in the absence of Hfq. Importantly, the sRNA (R1) used in the experiment was not cleaved and remained protected from RNase E digestion. To pinpoint cleavage sites for RNase E in the absence of Hfq, the preferred site for RNase E cleavage in the target RNA was identified by mapping the cleavage sites in the duplex 47-mer R0 RNA annealed to sRNA using alkaline hydrolysis and RNase T1 digestion (Fig. 2B). The duplex R0/R1 RNA was cleaved by RNase E at positions +29, ∼31, +35, and +37, which are the downstream cleavage sites proximal to the 5′-end of the sRNA. Interestingly, we observed that the “A” nucleotide is a more preferred base than the “U” nucleotide in the target RNA guided by the sRNA for RNase E cleavage. When a 47-mer target RNA (R0) is present in the reaction without sRNA, the major cleavage products are short RNAs (<10 nt) resulting from degradation at the upstream cleavage sites by RNase E stimulated by the 5′-P (Fig. 1A). Thus, the 25-mer sRNA forming a duplex region resists cleavage by RNase E, resulting in preferred cleavage patterns in the unpaired re"

The parasite divides unidirectionally along the longitudinal cell axis from the anterior cell tip toward the posterior cell tip through a mechanism distinct from that in the cells of its human host. Initiation of cytokinesis in T. brucei is regulated by two evolutionarily conserved protein kinases, the Polo-like kinase TbPLK and the Aurora B kinase TbAUK1, and a cohort of trypanosome-specific proteins, including the three cytokinesis initiation factors CIF1, CIF2, and CIF3. Here, using RNAi, in situ epitope tagging of proteins, GST pulldown, and coimmunoprecipitation assays, and immunofluorescence and scanning electron microscopy analyses, we report the identification and functional characterization of two trypanosome-specific proteins, flagellum attachment zone tip–localizing protein required for cytokinesis (FPRC) and CIF4. We found that the two proteins colocalize to the distal tips of the new and the old flagellum attachment zones and are required for cytokinesis initiation. Knockdown of FPRC or CIF4 disrupted the localization of CIF1, suggesting that they function upstream of CIF1. Moreover, depletion of CIF4 abolished FPRC localization, indicating that CIF4 acts upstream of FPRC. Together, these results identify two new cytokinesis regulators in T. brucei and integrate them into the CIF1-mediated cytokinesis regulatory pathway. These findings highlight the existence of a cytokinesis pathway in T. brucei that is different from that of its mammalian host and therefore suggest that cytokinesis in T. brucei could potentially be exploited as a new drug target. The evolutionarily early divergent human parasite Trypanosoma brucei proliferates through binary cell fission in both its tsetse fly vector and mammalian host. The parasite divides unidirectionally along the longitudinal cell axis from the anterior cell tip toward the posterior cell tip through a mechanism distinct from that in the cells of its human host. Initiation of cytokinesis in T. brucei is regulated by two evolutionarily conserved protein kinases, the Polo-like kinase TbPLK and the Aurora B kinase TbAUK1, and a cohort of trypanosome-specific proteins, including the three cytokinesis initiation factors CIF1, CIF2, and CIF3. Here, using RNAi, in situ epitope tagging of proteins, GST pulldown, and coimmunoprecipitation assays, and immunofluorescence and scanning electron microscopy analyses, we report the identification and functional characterization of two trypanosome-specific proteins, flagellum attachment zone tip–localizing protein required for cytokinesis (FPRC) and CIF4.

https://openalex.org/W2976076385,"Dioecy (distinct male and female individuals) and scarce to non-flowering are common features of cultivated yam (Dioscorea spp.). However, the molecular mechanisms underlying flowering and sex determination in Dioscorea are largely unknown. We conducted SuperSAGE transcriptome profiling of male, female and monoecious individuals to identify flowering and sex-related genes in white Guinea yam (D. rotundata), generating 20,236 unique tags. Of these, 13,901 were represented by a minimum of 10 tags. A total 88 tags were significantly differentially expressed in male, female and monoecious plants, of which 18 corresponded to genes previously implicated in flower development and sex determination in multiple plant species. We validated the SuperSAGE data with quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR)-based analysis of the expression of three candidate genes. We further investigated the flowering patterns of 1938 D. rotundata accessions representing diverse geographical origins over two consecutive years. Over 85% of accessions were either male or non-flowering, less than 15% were female, while monoecious plants were rare. Intensity of flowering varied between male and female plants, with the former flowering more abundantly than the latter. Candidate genes identified in this study can be targeted for further validation and to induce regular flowering in poor to non-flowering cultivars. Findings of the study provide important inputs for further studies aiming to overcome the challenge of flowering in yams and to improve efficiency of yam breeding."

Therefore, the aim of this study was to test predictions of the OPTIMAL theory and identify key attentional and motivational factors that impact the accuracy of the penalty kick. The following six groups of moderately skilled participants performed penalty kicks following instructions that directed their focus of attention or impacted their autonomy support: external focus with autonomy support (EF/AS), external focus alone (EF), internal focus with autonomy support (IF/AS), internal focus alone (IF), autonomy support alone (AS) and control (C) groups. The analysis showed that the EF/AS group demonstrated better kicking accuracy relatively to the IF/AS, IF and C groups, but there were no significant differences between the EF/AS and EF or AS groups. Interestingly, the EF/AS group showed higher self-efficacy compared to the EF, IF/AS, IF and C groups. The finding suggest that a combination of attentional and motivational factors may produce benefits in motor performance."
https://openalex.org/W2975651268,"The CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing technique has been widely used to generate transgene-free mutants in different plant species. Several different methods including fluorescence marker-assisted visual screen of transgene-free mutants and programmed self-elimination of CRISPR/Cas9 construct have been used to increase the efficiency of genome edited transgene-free mutant isolation, but the overall time length required to obtain transgene-free mutants has remained unchanged in these methods. We report here a method for fast generation and easy identification of transgene-free mutants in Arabidopsis. By generating and using a single FT expression cassette-containing CRISPR/Cas9 construct, we targeted two sites of the AITR1 gene. We obtained many early bolting plants in T1 generation, and found that about two thirds of these plants have detectable mutations. We then analyzed T2 generations of two representative lines of genome edited early bolting T1 plants, and identified plants without early bolting phenotype, i.e., transgene-free plants, for both lines. Further more, aitr1 homozygous mutants were successful obtained for both lines from these transgene-free plants. Taken together, these results suggest that the method described here enables fast generation, and at the mean time, easy identification of transgene-free mutants in plants."
https://openalex.org/W2976586699,"Straw retention is an effective method to conserve soil water content and improve soil carbon stocks. However, how soil carbon dynamics respond to different straw retention practices remains unclear. In this study, we investigated soil respiration and soil carbon sequestration at depths of 0–100 cm. We conducted a two-year field experiment with three crop rotation treatments and three straw retention treatments in northwest China. The straw retention treatments included no straw retention (NS), retention of half the straw (HS), and retention of the total amount of straw (TS). The crop rotations treatments included winter wheat plus summer soybean (WS), winter wheat plus summer maize (WM), and winter wheat plus summer fallow (WF). Mean soil respiration rates under WS, WM, and WF treatments were 5.14, 6.53, and 5.49 μmol·m-2·s-1; and 5.67, 5.47, and 6.03 μmol·m-2·s-1 under TS, HS, and NS treatments. The mean soil water content were 15.50%, 15.57%, and 15.74% under WS, WM, and WF rotations, and 15.81%, 15.41%, and 15.50% under TS, HS, and NS treatments. The soil organic carbon (SOC) concentration was higher with increased straw retention, and lower at deeper soil depths. Mean SOC concentrations under different rotations and straw treatments of TS, HS, and NS, respectively were as follows: WS: 6.91, 6.63, 6.39 g/kg; WM: 6.90, 6.72, 6.57 g/kg; and WF: 6.49, 6.52, 6.37 g/kg. Soil temperature was the main determinant of soil respiration rates. We conclude that WS rotation resulted in lower soil respiration, WM rotation resulted in a higher soil carbon sequestration potential, and WF rotation resulted in higher soil water content. However, continued, long-term monitoring is needed to confirm the effect of rotations and straw retention on soil respiration and carbon sequestration in dryland cropping systems in northern China."
https://openalex.org/W2975403278,"The jasmonic acid cascade plays a pivotal role in induced plant resistance to herbivores. There have been a number of investigations into the potential uses of derivatives of this hormone for pest management. Understanding the phenotypic plasticity of plant defense traits interactions in agricultural systems may facilitate the development of novel and improved management practices, which is desirable as management of insects in most agricultural systems is currently heavily reliant on insecticides. The rice water weevil (RWW), Lissorhoptrus oryzophilus Kuschel, is a pest of rice, Oryza sativa, in the southern U.S. and globally. The effects of the jasmonic acid derivative, methyl jasmonate (MJ), on induced defenses to RWW in rice, and the potential costs of MJ-induced resistance to plant growth and fitness, were tested in a series of field and greenhouse trials. It was hypothesized that seed treatments with MJ would reduce densities of larval RWW. A second hypothesis was that MJ seed treatments would alter emergence, biomass accumulation, and yield of rice. The final hypothesis was that induction of plant resistance to the RWW would diminish as the time from seed treatment increased. In order to investigate these hypotheses, RWW densities were determined in greenhouse and field trials. Plant growth was measured in the field by assessing plant emergence, root and shoot biomass, time of heading, and yield (grain mass). Results indicated that MJ seed treatments induced resistance to RWW, although this effect decayed over time. Additionally, there were costs to plant growth and fitness; emergence and heading were delayed and biomass was reduced. Importantly, however, yields on a per-plant were not significantly reduced by MJ treatment. Overall, these results are promising and show the potential for the use of jasmonate elicitors as part of a pest management program in rice."
https://openalex.org/W2975418156,"The salmon louse (Lepeophtheirus salmonis) is an ectoparasite infecting Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar), which causes substantial problems to the salmon aquaculture and threatens wild salmon. Chitin synthesis inhibitors (CSIs) are used to control L. salmonis in aquaculture. CSIs act by interfering with chitin formation and molting. In the present study, we investigated the action of four CSIs: diflubenzuron (DFB), hexaflumuron (HX), lufenuron (LF), and teflubenzuron (TFB) on larval molt. As the mode of action of CSIs remains unknown, we selected key enzymes in chitin metabolism and investigated if CSI treatment influenced the transcriptional level of these genes. All four CSIs interfered with the nauplius II molt to copepodids in a dose-dependent manner. The EC50 values were 93.2 nM for diflubenzuron, 1.2 nM for hexaflumuron, 22.4 nM for lufenuron, and 11.7 nM for teflubenzuron. Of the investigated genes, only the transcriptional level of L. salmonis chitin synthase 1 decreased significantly in hexaflumuron and diflubenzuron-treated larvae. All the tested CSIs affected the molt of nauplius II L. salmonis larvae but at different concentrations. The larvae were most sensitive to hexaflumuron and less sensitive to diflubenzuron. None of the CSIs applied had a strong impact on the transcriptional level of chitin synthesis or chitinases genes in L. salmonis. Further research is necessary to get more knowledge of the nature of the inhibition of CSI and may require methods such as studies of protein structure and enzymological studies."

Pathological tau can undergo a range of post-translational modifications (PTMs) that are implicated as triggers of disease pathology. Recent studies now indicate that tau acetylation, in particular, controls both microtubule binding and tau aggregation, thereby acting as a central regulator of tau's biochemical properties and providing avenues to exploit for potential therapies. Here, using cell-based assays and tau transgenic mice harboring an acetylation-mimic mutation at residue Lys-280 (K280Q), we evaluated whether this substitution modifies the neurodegenerative disease pathology associated with the aggregate-prone tau P301S variant. Strikingly, the addition of a K280Q-substituted variant altered P301S-mediated tau conformation and reduced tau hyperphosphorylation. We further evaluated neurodegeneration markers in K280Q acetylation-mimic mice and observed reduced neuroinflammation as well as restored levels of N-methyl-d-aspartate receptors and post-synaptic markers compared with the parental mice. Thus, substituting a single lysine residue in the context of a P301S disease-linked mutation produces a unique tau species that abrogates some of the cardinal features of tauopathy. The findings of our study indicate that a complex tau PTM code likely regulates tau pathogenesis, highlighting the potential utility of manipulating and detoxifying tau strains through site-specific tau-targeting approaches.

https://openalex.org/W2977013034,"The structure of a social network as well as peer behaviours are thought to affect personal substance use. Where substance use may create health risks, understanding the contribution of social networks to substance use may be valuable for the design and implementation of harm reduction or other interventions. We examined the social support network of people living in precarious housing in a socially marginalized neighborhood of Vancouver, and analysed associations between social network structure, personal substance use, and supporters' substance use.An ongoing, longitudinal study recruited 246 participants from four single room occupancy hotels, with 201 providing social network information aligned with a 6-month observation period. Use of tobacco, alcohol, cannabis, cocaine (crack and powder), methamphetamine, and heroin was recorded at monthly visits. Ego- and graph-level measures were calculated; the dispersion and prevalence of substances in the network was described. Logistic mixed effects models were used to estimate the association between ego substance use and peer substance use. Permutation analysis was done to test for randomness of substance use dispersion on the social network.The network topology corresponded to residence (Hotel) with two clusters differing in demographic characteristics (Cluster 1 -Hotel A: 94% of members, Cluster 2 -Hotel B: 95% of members). Dispersion of substance use across the network demonstrated differences according to network topology and specific substance. Methamphetamine use (overall 12%) was almost entirely limited to Cluster 1, and absent from Cluster 2. Different patterns were observed for other substances. Overall, ego substance use did not differ over the six-month period of observation. Ego heroin, cannabis, or crack cocaine use was associated with alter use of the same substances. Ego methamphetamine, powder cocaine, or alcohol use was not associated with alter use, with the exception for methamphetamine in a densely using part of the network. For alters using multiple substances, cannabis use was associated with lower ego heroin use, and lower ego crack cocaine use. Permutation analysis also provided evidence that dispersion of substance use, and the association between ego and alter use was not random for all substances.In a socially marginalized neighborhood, social network topology was strongly influenced by residence, and in turn was associated with type(s) of substance use. Associations between personal use and supporter's use of a substance differed across substances. These complex associations may merit consideration in the design of interventions to reduce risk and harms associated with substance use in people living in precarious housing."

The effects of ultrasonication period (1-4 hours) and GNP weight fraction (0.5, 1.0, 1.5 and 2.0 wt.%) on the mechanical, thermal and conductivity properties were investigated. Results showed that the 3 hours of ultrasonic treatment on LNR/GNP gave the greatest improvement in tensile strength of 25.8% (TPNR/GNP nanocomposites) as compared to those without ultrasonication. The TPNR nanocomposites containing 1.5 wt.% GNP exhibited the highest strength (16 MPa for tensile, 14 MPa for flexural and 11 kJm-2 for impact) and modulus (556 MPa and 869 MPa for tensile and flexural, respectively). The incorporation of GNP had enhanced the thermal stability. It can be concluded that the GNP had imparted the thermally and electrically conductive nature to the TPNR blend."

In vitro assays revealed strong suppression of zoospore release and cystospore germination of P.halstedii by Plenaris. Bion (acibenzolar-S-methyl) and Apron (mefenoxam) were partially effective when used singly, but performed synergistically when mixed with Plenaris. Seed treatment (coating) with Plenaris provided dose-dependent control of the disease whereas Bion and Apron provided partial or poor control. However, seeds treated with mixtures containing reduced rates of Plenaris and full rates of Bion and/or Apron provided complete control of the disease due to the synergistic interaction between these components. Such mixtures should be used for seed treatment in the field to minimize selection pressure imposed on the pathogen."

The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of nipple shield use, explore the motives for nipple shield use and elucidate the association with exclusive breastfeeding in preterm infants. Methods The study was part of a prospective survey of a Danish national cohort of preterm infants based on questionnaires answered by the 1221 mothers of 1488 preterm infants with gestational age of 24–36 weeks. Data on nipple shield use was available for 1407 infants. Results Nipple shields were used by 54% of the mother-infant dyads for many different motives and was more often related to breastfeeding problems associated with the infant than with the mother. The most common motive for nipple shield use was “infant slipped the nipple” (52%). The lower the gestational age, the more frequently nipple shields were used for motives related to the infant. For those using a nipple shield, only the motive “infant fell asleep at the breast” was associated with a higher risk of not breastfeeding exclusively at discharge (OR 1.90 (95% CI 1.15; 3.13), p = 0.012), and “breast too engorged” with a lower risk of not breastfeeding exclusively (OR 0.32 (0.16; 0.63), p = 0.001), but overall nipple shield use was associated with failure of exclusive breastfeeding. Conclusion The present study does not give justifiable motives for nipple shield use, except for “breast too engorged”. Nipple shields should not be recommended for infants falling asleep at the breast, instead, staff and mothers should be patient, allowing the dyad time skin-to-skin. The results indicate that the use of a nipple shield does not promote exclusive breastfeeding in preterm infants."

Previous research has shown that impairments in repetitive finger movements emerge at rates near to and above 2 Hz in most persons with PD. Thus, the purpose of this study was to compare circle drawing performance in persons with PD that demonstrate impairment in repetitive finger movement and those that do not. Twenty-two participants with PD and twelve healthy older adults completed the study. Only participants with PD completed the repetitive finger movement task. From the kinematic data for the repetitive finger movement task, participants were grouped into Hasteners and Non-Hasteners. Participants with PD and the healthy older adults completed a series of circle drawing tasks at two different target sizes (1 cm and 2 cm) and three pacing conditions (Self-paced, 1.25 Hz, and 2.5 Hz). Kinematic and electromyography data were recorded and compared between groups. Results revealed that, in general, persons with PD demonstrate impairments in circle drawing and associated electromyography activity compared to healthy older adults. Moreover, persons with PD that hasten during repetitive finger movements demonstrate significantly increased movement rate during circle drawing, while those persons with PD that do not hasten demonstrate a significant increase in width variability. This suggests that differing motor control mechanisms may play a role in the performance of fine motor tasks in persons with PD. Continued research is needed to better understand differences in circle drawing performance among persons with PD to inform future development of patient-centered treatments."
https://openalex.org/W2977163536,"The true spatiotemporal structure of a fish population is often more complex than represented in assessments because movement between spawning components is disregarded and data at the necessary scale are unavailable. This can generate poor advice. We explore the impacts of modelling choices and their associated risks given limited data and lack of biological knowledge on spawning component structure and connectivity. Pseudo-data for an age structured fish population were simulated with two spawning components that experience various levels of connectivity and that might overlap during a certain period but segregate during reproduction. A variety of implicit spatiotemporal and simpler models were fitted to the pseudo-datasets, mimicking different situations of data availability. To reproduce the true stock characteristics, the spatiotemporal models required total catch data disaggregated by spawning component; however, catch-at-age was not as important nor were disaggregated biomass indices to reproduce true dynamics. Even with just 5% connectivity between spawning components, both the spatiotemporal models and simpler alternatives generally overestimated stock biomass. Although bias was smallest when considering one unit population, spawning components might still need to be considered for management and conservation. In such case, the spatiotemporal model was less influenced by ignored connectivity patterns compared to a model focussing on one spawning component only."
https://openalex.org/W2975031184,"Background Five guideline-recommended medication categories are available to treat patients who have heart failure (HF) with reduced ejection fraction. However, adherence to these medications is often suboptimal, which places patients at increased risk for poor health outcomes, including hospitalization. We aimed to examine the association between adherence to these medications and potentially preventable HF hospitalizations among younger insured adults with newly diagnosed HF. Methods and results Using the 2008–2012 IBM MarketScan Commercial database, we followed 26,439 individuals aged 18–64 years with newly diagnosed HF and calculated their adherence (using the proportion of days covered (PDC) algorithm) to the five guideline-recommended medication categories: angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors/angiotensin-receptor blockers; beta blockers; aldosterone receptor antagonists; hydralazine; and isosorbide dinitrate. We determined the association between PDC and long-term preventable HF hospitalizations (observation years 3–5) as defined by the United States (U.S.) Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality. Overall, 49.0% of enrollees had good adherence (PDC≥80%), which was more common among enrollees who were older, male, residing in higher income counties, initially diagnosed with HF in an outpatient setting, and who filled prescriptions for fewer medication categories assessed. Adherence differed by medication category and was lowest for isosorbide dinitrate (PDC = 60.7%). In total, 7.6% of enrollees had preventable HF hospitalizations. Good adherers, compared to poor adherers (PDC<40%), were 15% less likely to have a preventable hospitalization (HR 0.85, 95% confidence interval, 0.75–0.96). Conclusion We found that approximately half of insured U.S. adults aged 18–64 years with newly diagnosed HF had good adherence to their HF medications. Patients with good adherence, compared to those with poor adherence, were less likely to have a potentially preventable HF hospitalization 3–5 years after their initial diagnosis. Because HF is a chronic condition that requires long-term management, future studies may want to assess the effectiveness of interventions in sustaining adherence."
https://openalex.org/W2976098312,"Dendritic cells (DCs) are professional antigen presenting cells involved in the induction of T cell-mediated adaptive immunity. Plasmacytoid DCs (pDCs) originate from lymphoid precursors and produce type I interferons (IFNs) in response to pathogens. A20 is considered as a negative regulator of toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling pathways, in which Toxoplasma gondii- derived profilin (TgPRF) is a TLR11/12 ligand recognised by DCs to stimulate their maturation/activation. Little is known about contributions of A20 to changes in biological properties of pDCs. The present study, therefore, explored whether pDC functions are influenced by A20. To this end, bone marrow cells were isolated and cultured with Flt3L to attain CD8DCs, CD11bDCs and pDCs and followed by challenge with TgPRP in the presence or absence of A20 siRNA. Expression of maturation markers were analysed by flow cytometry, and secretion of inflammatory cytokines by ELISA, cell migration by a transwell migration assay and expression of signalling molecules by western blotting. As a result, treatment with A20 siRNA enhanced activations of IκB-α and STAT-1, leading to increases in expressions of maturation markers and cytokine productions as well as migration of TgPRP-treated pDCs, while mature CD11bDCs produced at higher levels of TNF-α and IL-6 only. In addition, functions of CD8DCs remained unaltered following A20 silencing. The effects of A20 on pDC maturation and activation were completely abolished by IKK inhibitor and partially blunted by fludarabine. In conclusion, the inhibitory effects of A20 on pDC functions are expected to affect the immune response in T. gondii infection."
https://openalex.org/W2977021027,"The immune rejection mediated by CD4+ T cell and antigen presenting macrophages is the leading cause of corneal transplantation failure. Bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (BM-MSCs) possess robust immunomodulatory potentials, and have been shown by us and others to promote corneal allograft survival. However, the immunological mechanism underlying the protective effects of BM-MSCs remains unclear. Therefore, in the current study, this mechanism was investigated in a BM-MSC-treated rat model of corneal allograft rejection, in the hope to facilitate the search for novel interventional targets to corneal allograft rejection.Lewis rats were subjected to corneal transplantation and then received subconjunctival injections of BM-MSCs (2×106 cells / 100 μl PBS) immediately and at day 3 post-transplantation. The control group received the injections of PBS with the same volume. The clinical parameters of the corneal allografts, including opacity, edema, and neovascularization, were regularly evaluated after transplantation. On day 10 post-transplantation, the corneal allografts were collected and subjected to flow cytometry and high-throughput RNA sequencing (RNA-seq). GO enrichment and KEGG pathways were analyzed. The quantitative realtime PCR (qPCR) and immunohistochemistry (IHC) were employed to validate the expression of the selected target genes at transcript and protein levels, respectively.BM-MSC subconjunctival administration prolonged the corneal allograft survival, with reduced opacity, alleviated edema, and diminished neovascularization. Flow cytometry showed reduced CD4+ T cells and CD68+ macrophages as well as boosted regulatory T cells (Tregs) in the BM-MSC-treated corneal allografts as compared with the PBS-treated counterparts. Moreover, the RNA-seq and qPCR results demonstrated that the transcript abundance of Cytotoxic T-Lymphocyte Associated Protein 4 (Ctla4), Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase, Receptor Type C (Ptprc), and C-X-C Motif Chemokine Ligand 9 (Cxcl9) genes were increased in the allografts of BM-MSC group compared with PBS group; whereas the expression of Heat Shock Protein Family A (Hsp70) Member 8 (Hspa8) gene was downregulated. The expression of these genes was confirmed by IHC at protein level.Subconjunctival injections of BM-MSCs promoted corneal allograft survival, reduced CD4+ and CD68+ cell infiltration, and enriched Treg population in the allografts. The BM-MSC-induced upregulation of Ctla4, Ptprc, Cxcl9 genes and downregulation of Hspa8 gene might contribute to the protective effects of BM-MSCs and subserve the potential interventional targets to corneal allograft rejection."
https://openalex.org/W2975496054,"Aims To explore actions and motivations for self-management practices of Pacific adults following diagnosis of end stage renal disease (ESRD). Methods Focused ethnography using in-depth interviews with 16 Pacific people on haemodialysis for diabetic ESRD, in Auckland, New Zealand. Study participants were of Samoan, Cook Islander, Tongan, Niuean, or Tokelauan ethnicity and aged between 30 to 69 years old. Thematic analysis was used to code and identify emergent themes. Results All participants assumed active responsibility for their self-management following their diagnosis of ESRD. They reported positive differences in their current self-management behaviours, compared to pre-ESRD diagnosis. In the face of their terminal diagnosis, participant’s motivations to self-manage their health were fuelled by hope; the hope to live long enough to change their family legacy of diabetes and ESRD. To achieve this, there was a dependency upon family members as a resource for self-management support. Yet at the same time, family members also had health concerns (including diabetes), and several participants themselves were carers for sick or elderly family members. Conclusion The growing number of members (within family units) progressing from moderate to late-stage diabetes raises concerns about the sustainability of future family support in Pacific families in New Zealand with histories of diabetes, ESRD, and other chronic diseases. While the burden upon informal carers (family) has been well documented throughout the past few decades, the dynamics of bi-directional carer support between (two or more) sick family members and their families have had less exposure. This has potentially significant implications for Pacific peoples in New Zealand, considering the increases in diabetes prevalence within their families."

Coordinated phosphoinositide signaling is critical both for phagocytic particle engulfment and subsequent phagosomal maturation to a degradative organelle. Phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate (PtdIns(3)P) is a phosphoinositide that is rapidly synthesized and degraded on phagosomal membranes, where it recruits FYVE domain– and PX motif–containing proteins that promote phagosomal maturation. However, the molecular mechanisms that regulate PtdIns(3)P removal from the phagosome have remained unclear. We report here that a myotubularin PtdIns(3)P 3-phosphatase, myotubularin-related protein-4 (MTMR4), regulates macrophage phagocytosis. MTMR4 overexpression reduced and siRNA-mediated Mtmr4 silencing increased levels of cell-surface immunoglobulin receptors (i.e. Fcγ receptors (FcγRs)) on RAW 264.7 macrophages, associated with altered pseudopodal F-actin. Furthermore, MTMR4 negatively regulated the phagocytosis of IgG-opsonized particles, indicating that MTMR4 inhibits FcγR-mediated phagocytosis, and was dynamically recruited to phagosomes of macrophages during phagocytosis. MTMR4 overexpression decreased and Mtmr4-specific siRNA expression increased the duration of PtdIns(3)P on phagosomal membranes. Macrophages treated with Mtmr4-specific siRNA were more resistant to Mycobacterium marinum–induced phagosome arrest, associated with increased maturation of mycobacterial phagosomes, indicating that extended PtdIns(3)P signaling on phagosomes in the Mtmr4-knockdown cells permitted trafficking of phagosomes to acidic late endosomal and lysosomal compartments. In conclusion, our findings indicate that MTMR4 regulates PtdIns(3)P degradation in macrophages and thereby controls phagocytosis and phagosomal maturation.

Furthermore, MTMR4 negatively regulated the phagocytosis of IgG-opsonized particles, indicating that MTMR4 inhibits FcγR-mediated phagocytosis, and was dynamically recruited to phagosomes of macrophages during phagocytosis. MTMR4 overexpression decreased and Mtmr4-specific siRNA expression increased the duration of PtdIns(3)P on phagosomal membranes. Macrophages treated with Mtmr4-specific siRNA were more resistant to Mycobacterium marinum–induced phagosome arrest, associated with increased maturation of mycobacterial phagosomes, indicating that extended PtdIns(3)P signaling on phagosomes in the Mtmr4-knockdown cells permitted trafficking of phagosomes to acidic late endosomal and lysosomal compartments. In conclusion, our findings indicate that MTMR4 regulates PtdIns(3)P degradation in macrophages and thereby controls phagocytosis and phagosomal maturation. Macrophages contribute to immune control of infection, tissue remodeling, and inflammation by undergoing a selective pathogen removal process, phagocytosis, which is critical for the clearance of apoptotic bodies and invading microorganisms (1Flannagan R.S.

This induces FcγR clustering leading to localized actin polymerization that, in turn, propels the elaboration of pseudopods, which internalize the target into a membrane-bound vacuole called the phagosome (3Yeung T.

However, although the generation of PtdIns(3)P by the Class III phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) is well-described in mammalian cells (7Marat A.L. Haucke V.

Myotubularin-related protein-4 (MTMR4) is a member of the myotubularin family of phosphoinositide phosphatases that selectively degrade the 3-position phosphate from the inositol ring of PtdIns(3)P and phosphatidylinositol 3,5-bisphosphate (PtdIns(3,5)P2) (8Cullen P.J.

Following ligand binding, stimulatory FcγRs undergo cross-linking with phosphorylation of associated immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motifs, thereby initiating signaling via tyrosine kinases and Class I PI3K to promote pseudopodal extension, which is required for phagocytosis via actin polymerization (19Swanson J.A. Hoppe A.D. The coordination of signaling during Fc receptor-mediated phagocytosis.J. Leukoc. Biol. 2004; 76 (15466916): 1093-110310.1189/jlb.0804439Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). Accordingly, initiation of phagocytosis depends on the presence of FcγRs at the cell surface, which is highly regulated by endocytic recycling and degradation. However, whether MTMR4 regulates FcγR levels at the cell surface is unknown, and a potential role for MTMR4 in regulating phagosomal PtdIns(3)P and thereby phagosomal maturation has yet to be determined. Here, we investigated whether MTMR4 regulates phagosomal PtdIns(3)P and plays a role in phagosomal internalization and maturation in mammalian macrophages. MTMR4 overexpression decreased the surface expression of FcγRs and pseudopodal actin formation in RAW 264.7 macrophage cells, indicating that MTMR4 plays a role in phagocytosis initiation. Interestingly, MTMR4 overexpression was associated with a decreased efficiency of phagocytosis. We found that MTMR4 was dynamically recruited to the forming phagosome and negatively regulated the duration and amplitude of PtdIns(3)P signals on phagosomes. Finally, MTMR4 depletion accelerated the maturation of phagosomes containing pathogenic mycobacteria. These results identify MTMR4 as a novel regulator of macrophage phagocytosis that directs phagosomal PtdIns(3)P turnover. Endogenous MTMR4 expression in macrophages was assessed by immunoblotting of RAW 264.7 cell lysates using a polyclonal antibody against MTMR4 (12Naughtin M.J. Sheffield D.A. Rahman P. Hughes W.E. Gurung R. Stow J.L. Nandurkar H.H. Dyson J.M. Mitchell C.A. The myotubularin phosphatase MTMR4 regulates sorting from early endosomes.J. Cell Sci. 2010; 123 (20736309): 3071-308310.1242/jcs.060103Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), which detected an immunoreactive polypeptide migrating at 165 kDa consistent with its predicted molecular mass (Fig. 1Ai). Similarly, RAW 264.7 cells transfected with recombinant HA-MTMR4 expressed a 165-kDa polypeptide detected by anti-HA antibodies (Fig. 1Aii). At steady state, FcγRs undergo cycles of endocytosis and recycling back to the plasma membrane, whereas ligand-bound FcγRs are diverted away from the recycling compartment to the degradative pathway (20Mellman I.S. Plutner H. Steinman R.M. Unkeless J.C. Cohn Z.A. Internalization and degradation of macrophage Fc receptors during receptor-mediated phagocytosis.J. Cell Biol. 1983; 96 (6833386): 887-89510.1083/jcb.96.3.887Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). As MTMR4 is reported to regulate the trafficking of transferrin and epidermal growth factor receptor (12Naughtin M.J. Sheffield D.A. Rahman P. Hughes W.E. Gurung R. Stow J.L. Nandurkar H.H. Dyson J.M. Mitchell C.A. The myotubularin phosphatase MTMR4 regulates sorting from early endosomes.J. Cell Sci. 2010; 123 (20736309): 3071-308310.1242/jcs.060103Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), we next assessed whether MTMR4 can regulate the cell-surface expression of FcγRI and FcγRII/III at steady state. RAW 264.7 cells showed intense FcγRI and FcγRII/III immunofluorescence staining at the cell membrane, whereas cells expressing HA-MTMR4 showed less intense staining of FcγRI, but not FcγRII/III, when compared with nontransfected cells and the HA-vector control (Fig. 1B). Quantification of FcγRI immunofluorescence intensity showed 20% less surface FcγRI in cells expressing HA-MTMR4 compared with vector controls (Fig. 1C), whereas no significant difference in surface FcγRII/III was observed (Fig. S1A). In a similar experiment, siRNA targeting Mtmr4 was used to generate Mtmr4-knockdown RAW 264.7 cells. The efficiency of Mtmr4 knockdown was confirmed by quantitative RT-PCR (Fig. 1D), and decreased protein expression was confirmed by Western blotting (Fig. 1E). RAW 264.7 cells treated with Mtmr4 siRNA showed increased surface expression of extracellular FcγRI and FcγRII/III as assessed by flow cytometry (Fig. 1F). This was not a consequence of altered total cellular levels of FcγRs, as this difference was not observed when intracellular receptors were included in immunostaining of permeabilized cells (Fig. S1B). This result was confirmed by immunofluorescence microscopy (Fig. 1G), which revealed a significant increase in immunofluorescent staining of FcγRI and FcγRII/III in cells treated with Mtmr4 siRNA (Fig. 1H). To confirm the specificity of this effect, RAW 264.7 cells were treated with Mtmr4 siRNA and subsequently transfected with HA-MTMR4 or HA-vector as a control before fixation and immunofluorescent assessment of FcγRI. Rescue of Mtmr4 knockdown by HA-MTMR4 overexpression, but no change in HA-vector control samples, verified the specific regulation of FcγR surface levels by MTMR4 (Fig. 1I). One of the critical events initiated via clustered FcγR signaling is the local remodeling of the submembranous actin cytoskeleton (21Greenberg S. el Khoury J. di Virgilio F. Kaplan E.M. Silverstein S.C. Ca2+-independent F-actin assembly and disassembly during Fc receptor-mediated phagocytosis in mouse macrophages.J.

We next assessed the presence of F-actin at phagocytic cups in cells overexpressing HA-MTMR4. RAW 264.7 cells transfected with either HA-vector or HA-MTMR4 were incubated with 6-μm IgG-opsonized latex beads (bIgG-6μm) to facilitate FcγR-mediated phagocytosis. Immunofluorescent assessment showed the distinct presence of phalloidin-stained F-actin at the phagocytic cups in control cells as well as HA-MTMR4–expressing cells (Fig. 2A). However, quantification revealed that cells expressing HA-MTMR4 showed a 20% reduction in the intensity of F-actin at phagocytic cups compared with vector controls (Fig. 2B). In contrast, cells treated with Mtrm4 siRNA showed a 57% increase in F-actin intensity at phagocytic cups (Fig. 2C). Therefore, MTMR4 overexpression decreases FcγRI at the cell surface and is associated with decreased phagocytic cup F-actin. One possible functional outcome of altered FcγR surface expression and actin polymerization is altered phagocytosis induction (1Flannagan R.S. Cosío G. Grinstein S. Antimicrobial mechanisms of phagocytes and bacterial evasion strategies.Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2009; 7 (19369951): 355-36610.1038/nrmicro2128Crossref PubMed Scopus (649) Google Scholar). Therefore, we next investigated whether MTMR4 regulates the efficiency of phagocytosis in macrophages. RAW 264.7 cells expressing HA-MTMR4 or HA-vector as a control were incubated with bIgG-6μm, and the phagocytic index was determined as the number of fully internalized beads per 100 cells normalized to HA-vector control. The phagocytic index was reduced in cells expressing HA-MTMR4 compared with vector controls (Fig. 3A). Because a similar effect was observed using 9-μm (Fig. 3B) and 3-μm (Fig. 3C) IgG beads, this effect was not dependent on bead size, suggesting that MTMR4 does not regulate phagocytosis by restriction of membrane delivery to the phagocytic cup (24Huynh K.K. Kay J.G. Stow J.L. Grinstein S. Fusion, fission, and secretion during phagocytosis.Physiology (Bethesda). 2007; 22 (18073409): 366-37210.1152/physiol.00028.2007Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The catalytic activity of MTMR4 was required for phagocytosis regulation, as no difference in the phagocytic index was observed in cells transfected with catalytically inactive HA-MTMR4(C407A) (Fig. S2). Mtmr4 siRNA–treated cells showed a 16–22% increase in the phagocytosis of bIgG-6μm compared with control siRNA cells (Fig. 3D). To evaluate the extent to which MTMR4 negative regulation of phagocytosis depended on PI3K signaling, phagocytosis assays were carried out in cells pretreated with the PI3K inhibitor LY294002, which inhibits both phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate (PtdIns(3,4,5)P3) and PtdIns(3)P generation by Class I, II, and III PI3Ks (with the exception of Class IIα) (7Marat A.L. Haucke V. Phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphates: at the interface between cell signalling and membrane traffic.EMBO J. 2016; 35 (26888746): 561-57910.15252/embj.201593564Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). LY294002 treatment resulted in significant inhibition of phagocytosis with no observed effect of Mtmr4 knockdown compared with control cells under these conditions (Fig. 3E). This result is consistent with the contention that MTMR4 negative regulation of phagocytosis occurs in part via a PI3K-dependent mechanism. To assess MTMR4 subcellular localization during phagocytosis, HA-MTMR4–expressing RAW 264.7 cells were examined by immunofluorescence when phagocytosing bIgG-6μm particles. HA-MTMR4 was found to be enriched on punctate and vesicular structures and on phagosomes with cytosolic signal also present (Fig. 4A), revealing that MTMR4 is recruited to phagosomes during FcγR-mediated phagocytosis. We noted that phagosomal MTMR4 levels varied between phagosomes, consistent with the transient pattern of phagosomal PtdIns(3)P signal appearance and disappearance (4Ellson C.D. Anderson K.E. Morgan G. Chilvers E.R. Lipp P. Stephens L.R. Hawkins P.T. Phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate is generated in phagosomal membranes.Curr.

To evaluate the spatiotemporal recruitment of MTMR4 to individual phagosomes, cells expressing YFP-MTMR4 were imaged live during phagocytosis of bIgG-6μm (Fig. 4B and Movie S1). As an experimental control, cells were cotransfected with CFP, a cytoplasmic marker, to ensure that YFP signal detected at the phagosome was the result of YFP-MTMR4 recruitment and not a consequence of morphometric changes due to pseudopodia and membrane ruffling (25Dewitt S. Darley R.L. Hallett M.B. Translocation or just location? Pseudopodia affect fluorescent signals.J.

Under these conditions, mobilization of YFP-MTMR4-positive vesicles toward the base of the phagocytic cup was observed at the 1-min time point (Fig. 4B, arrows). Following engulfment, increased YFP-MTMR4 signal was detected around the phagosome (Fig. 4B). MTMR4 was also observed on motile structures with transient contacts made with each other and the phagosome, a pattern reminiscent of endosomal “kiss and run” behavior (Fig. 4B (arrowheads) and Movie S1) (4Ellson C.D. Anderson K.E. Morgan G. Chilvers E.R. Lipp P. Stephens L.R. Hawkins P.T. Phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate is generated in phagosomal membranes.Curr.

Similar changes were not observed in the cytoplasmic CFP signal, which remained evenly distributed over the entire time course (Fig. 4B). To quantify the recruitment of MTMR4 to the phagosome, the ratio of YFP-MTMR4 fluorescence to CFP fluorescence in the region of the phagosome (Rp) was calculated, and this was normalized to the corresponding YFP/CFP fluorescence of the entire cell (Rc) to control for variation in construct expression. The early recruitment of YFP-MTMR4 to the phagosome during engulfment was reflected by a steep increase in the Rp/Rc ratio, followed by a decline in YFP-MTMR4 fluorescence on the phagosome over a time scale of 5–10 min (Fig. 4C). Hereafter, the signal showed increased variability but remained above cellular background for >30 min in some cells. These results indicate a dynamic pattern of time-dependent recruitment of MTMR4 to the phagosome. MTMR4 dephosphorylates PtdIns(3)P and PtdIns(3,5)P2 in vitro and regulates endosomal PtdIns(3)P in vivo (12Naughtin M.J. Sheffield D.A. Rahman P. Hughes W.E. Gurung R. Stow J.L. Nandurkar H.H. Dyson J.M. Mitchell C.A. The myotubularin phosphatase MTMR4 regulates sorting from early endosomes.J. Cell Sci. 2010; 123 (20736309): 3071-308310.1242/jcs.060103Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). However, whether MTMR4 plays a role in regulating the removal of phagosomal PtdIns(3)P is unknown. The temporal relationship between PtdIns(3)P and MTMR4 phagosomal recruitment was therefore assessed by cotransfecting cells with the PtdIns(3)P biosensor mCherry-2xFYVE (2xFYVE) and YFP-MTMR4, followed by live imaging during the phagocytosis of bIgG-6μm. The 2xFYVE probe was enriched on the formed phagosome with peak signal and then a decline in signal within the first 10 min as reported (Fig. 5Ai) (4Ellson C.D. Anderson K.E. Morgan G. Chilvers E.R. Lipp P. Stephens L.R. Hawkins P.T. Phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate is generated in phagosomal membranes.Curr. Biol. 2001; 11 (11676926): 1631-163510.1016/S0960-9822(01)00447-XAbstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). YFP-MTMR4 recruitment to the phagosome occurred after 2xFYVE enrichment and coincided with the decline in 2xFYVE signal (Fig. 5Aii). This was supported by quantification of 2xFYVE and YFP-MTMR4 signals on phagosomes, indicating a decrease in phagosomal PtdIns(3)P immediately after recruitment of YFP-MTMR4 to the phagosome (Fig. 5B). To characterize the role of MTMR4 in PtdIns(3)P phagosome kinetics, we assessed the accumulation of mCherry-2xFYVE during phagocytosis in cells coexpressing HA-vector control (Fig. 5C), HA-MTMR4 (Fig. 5D), or a catalytically inactive mutant HA-MTMR4(C407A) (Fig. 5E) that we have described previously (12Naughtin M.J. Sheffield D.A. Rahman P. Hughes W.E. Gurung R. Stow J.L. Nandurkar H.H. Dyson J.M. Mitchell C.A. The myotubularin phosphatase MTMR4 regulates sorting from early endosomes.J. Cell Sci. 2010; 123 (20736309): 3071-308310.1242/jcs.060103Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Again, the 2xFYVE signal around the phagosome was quantified in each experiment. In cells expressing HA-MTMR4, phagosomal PtdIns(3)P signals initially rose at a similar rate relative to HA-vector–transfected cells, but they peaked and declined more rapidly with MTMR4 expression (Fig. 5F and Movies S2 and S3). In contrast, cells expressing HA-MTMR4(C407A) showed"

There is a pressing need to improve the clinical efficacy and quality of life for AD patients, as limited treatments options for AD patients have been developed until now. In this study, we aim to investigate the protective effect of CH(II), a cerebroprotein hydrolysate consisted of abundant biological peptides, on preclinical model of AD. We found that CH(II) treatment effectively protects oxygen glucose deprivation (OGD)-induced N2A cell viability impairment and cell apoptosis. In addition, CH(II) significantly reduces H2O2-induced ROS accumulation and exhibits the protective activities against H2O2-induced oxidative injury. Intriguingly, we found that CH(II) treatment can effectively promote neurite outgrowth of N2A cells. Moreover, CH(II) obviously improve the cognitive and memorial function in scopolamine-induced amnesia mice model. Taken together, this study provides evidences of the neuroprotective activities of CH(II) and offers a potential therapeutic strategy for AD patients."
https://openalex.org/W2976649403,"Objective Regular physical activity may be associated with improved lung function via reduced systemic inflammation, although studies exploring this mechanism are rare. We evaluated the role of C-reactive protein in blood, which is a common marker of systemic inflammation, on the association of physical activity with forced expiratory volume in one second and forced vital capacity. Methods Cross-sectional data on spirometry, C-reactive protein levels and self-reported physical activity (yes/no; ≥2 times and ≥1hr per week of vigorous physical activity) were available in the European Community Respiratory Health Survey (N = 2347 adults, 49.3% male, 28–56 years-old). A subsample was also assessed 10 years later using the International Physical Activity Questionnaire, and tertiles of Metabolic Equivalent of Task—minutes per week spent in vigorous, moderate and walking activities were calculated (N = 671, 49.6% male, 40–67 years-old). Adjusted cross-sectional mixed linear regression models and the “mediate” package in “R” were used to assess the presence of mediation. Results Despite positive significant associations between nearly all physical activity metrics with forced expiratory volume in one second and forced vital capacity, there was no evidence that C-reactive protein levels played a role. An influence of C-reactive protein levels was only apparent in the smaller subsample when comparing the medium to low tertiles of moderate activity (mean difference [95% CIs]: 21.1ml [5.2, 41.9] for forced expiratory volume in one second and 17.3ml [2.6, 38.0] for forced vital capacity). Conclusions In a population of adults, we found no consistent evidence that the association of physical activity with forced expiratory volume in one second or forced vital capacity is influenced by the level of C-reactive protein in blood."

https://openalex.org/W2975103788,"The anti-saccade task is a commonly used method of assessing individual differences in cognitive control. It has been shown that a number of clinical disorders are characterised by increased anti-saccade cost. However, it remains unknown whether this reflects impaired goal identification or impaired goal execution, because, to date, no procedure has been developed to independently assess these two components of anti-saccade cost. The aim of the present study was to develop such an assessment task, which we term the Goal Identification Vs. Execution (GIVE) task. Fifty-one undergraduate students completed a conventional anti-saccade task, and our novel GIVE task. Our findings revealed that individual differences in anti-saccade goal identification costs and goal execution costs were uncorrelated, when assessed using the GIVE task, but both predicted unique variance in the conventional anti-saccade cost measure. These results confirm that the GIVE task is capable of independently assessing variation in the goal identification and goal execution components of the anti-saccade effect. We discuss how this newly introduced assessment procedure now can be employed to illuminate the specific basis of the increased anti-saccade cost that characterises various forms of clinical dysfunction."

To expand the capabilities of HCA, we have applied the same analysis methods, validated in numerous mammalian cell models, to microbiology methodology. Image acquisition and analysis of various microbial samples, ranging from pure cultures to culture mixtures containing up to three different bacterial species, were quantified and identified using various machine learning processes. These HCA techniques allow for faster cell enumeration than standard agar-plating methods, identification of “viable but not plate culturable” microbe phenotype, classification of antibiotic treatment effects, and identification of individual microbial strains in mixed cultures. These methods greatly expand the utility of HCA methods and automate tedious and low-throughput standard microbiological methods."
https://openalex.org/W2976832362,"Goat fat is one of the best sources of conjugated linoleic acid (CLA), a fatty acid which has health benefits. However, though CLA is generated in ruminants, CLA consumption is limited to meats and milk products. This study aimed to replace vegetable fat with goat milk fat enriched with CLA. From differing fat sources, four cookie recipes were developed: CVF-vegetable fat cookies; CB-butter cookies; CG-goat milk fat cookies without CLA; CGCLA-goat milk fat cookies with CLA. The cookies were evaluated using physical (color and texture), physical-chemical parameters (lipids, proteins, total sugars, fiber, ash, moisture and Aw), consumer testing (n = 123), and lipid profiles. The CGCLA presented higher values in the color parameters. The highest and the lowest scores obtained for hardness were respectively 5.54 (CB) and 2.21 (CVF). Lipids and total sugars varied inversely; the highest percentages of lipids were in the CVF and CG samples which obtained lower total sugar content. There were no differences in acceptance or preference for the four formulations. The goat cream formulations (CG and CGCLA) were as well accepted as the CFV formulation. For lipid profiles, CFV presented the highest percentage of trans-fatty acids (TFA) at 16.76%. CGCLA presented 70% more CLA than either CB or CG, certifying that CGCLA presents CLA in relevant quantities, even after cooking. The CGCLA presented higher levels of CLA, and in this study it was verified that goat milk cream enriched with CLA can be used in producing cookies, adding functional and nutritional properties, and offering another alternative(s) to produce food from goat milk fat."
