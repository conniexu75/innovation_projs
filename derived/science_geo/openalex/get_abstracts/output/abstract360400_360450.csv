https://openalex.org/W2012016911,"DNA sequence information underpins genetic research, enabling discoveries of important biological or medical benefit. Sequencing projects have traditionally used long (400-800 base pair) reads, but the existence of reference sequences for the human and many other genomes makes it possible to develop new, fast approaches to re-sequencing, whereby shorter reads are compared to a reference to identify intraspecies genetic variation. Here we report an approach that generates several billion bases of accurate nucleotide sequence per experiment at low cost. Single molecules of DNA are attached to a flat surface, amplified in situ and used as templates for synthetic sequencing with fluorescent reversible terminator deoxyribonucleotides. Images of the surface are analysed to generate high-quality sequence. We demonstrate application of this approach to human genome sequencing on flow-sorted X chromosomes and then scale the approach to determine the genome sequence of a male Yoruba from Ibadan, Nigeria. We build an accurate consensus sequence from >30x average depth of paired 35-base reads. We characterize four million single-nucleotide polymorphisms and four hundred thousand structural variants, many of which were previously unknown. Our approach is effective for accurate, rapid and economical whole-genome re-sequencing and many other biomedical applications."
https://openalex.org/W2153010521,"Acute myeloid leukaemia is a highly malignant haematopoietic tumour that affects about 13,000 adults in the United States each year. The treatment of this disease has changed little in the past two decades, because most of the genetic events that initiate the disease remain undiscovered. Whole-genome sequencing is now possible at a reasonable cost and timeframe to use this approach for the unbiased discovery of tumour-specific somatic mutations that alter the protein-coding genes. Here we present the results obtained from sequencing a typical acute myeloid leukaemia genome, and its matched normal counterpart obtained from the same patient’s skin. We discovered ten genes with acquired mutations; two were previously described mutations that are thought to contribute to tumour progression, and eight were new mutations present in virtually all tumour cells at presentation and relapse, the function of which is not yet known. Our study establishes whole-genome sequencing as an unbiased method for discovering cancer-initiating mutations in previously unidentified genes that may respond to targeted therapies. The technologies that made it possible to characterize individual African and Chinese genomes have broad application in the biomedical field. A demonstration of what can be achieved in a medical context is the first comprehensive sequence of an individual cancer genome, for a patient with acute myeloid leukaemia. By comparing DNA from cancer and normal tissue from the same individual, ten mutations of possible relevance for pathogenesis were identified. As well as pointing to genes that may respond to targeted therapy, this work is a step towards the long-term goal of establishing the contextual relevance of such mutants, a process that will involve the analysis of many more personal genomes."

Loss of specific miRNA control of gene expression is thus expected to underlie serious genetic diseases. Intriguingly, previous post-mortem analyses showed higher β-amyloid precursor protein-converting enzyme (BACE) protein, but not mRNA, levels in the brain of patients that suffered from Alzheimer disease (AD). Here we also observed a loss of correlation between BACE1 mRNA and protein levels in the hippocampus of a mouse model of AD. Consistent with an impairment of miRNA-mediated regulation of BACE1 expression, these findings prompted us to investigate the regulatory role of the BACE1 3′-UTR element and the possible involvement of specific miRNAs in cultured neuronal (N2a) and fibroblastic (NIH 3T3) cells. Through various experimental approaches, we validated computational predictions and demonstrated that miR-298 and miR-328 recognize specific binding sites in the 3′-UTR of BACE1 mRNA and exert regulatory effects on BACE1 protein expression in cultured neuronal cells. Our results may provide the molecular basis underlying BACE1 deregulation in AD and offer new perspectives on the etiology of this neurological disorder.

The risk of AD dramatically increases in individuals beyond the age of 70, and it is predicted that the incidence of AD will increase by 3-fold within the next 50 years (1Mattson M.P. Nature.. 2004; 430: 631-639Google Scholar). This progressive disease is characterized by the accumulation of plaques formed of short β-amyloid (Aβ) peptides (1Mattson M.P. Nature.. 2004; 430: 631-639Google Scholar, 2Whitehouse P.J. Struble R.G. Hedreen J.C. Clark A.W. Price D.L. CRC Crit. Rev. Clin. Neurobiol.. 1985; 1: 319-339Google Scholar, 3Selkoe D.J. Physiol.

This latter fragment is further processed in its intramembrane domain by the γ-secretase to produce C-terminal fragment γ and Aβ peptides (1Mattson M.P. Nature.. 2004; 430: 631-639Google Scholar), whose levels have been correlated with those of BACE1 (11Li R. Lindholm K. Yang L.B. Yue X. Citron M. Yan R. Beach T. Sue L. Sabbagh M. Cai H. Wong P. Price D. Shen Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A.. 2004; 101: 3632-3637Google Scholar). Interestingly, bace1-null mice do not demonstrate any developmental problems or aberrant behavioral phenotypes, rendering BACE1 a potential and attractive target for therapies against AD (12Roberds S.L.

Nat. Neurosci.. 2001; 4: 231-232Google Scholar). However, the structure of BACE1 reveals an active site that is more open and less hydrophobic, as compared with other aspartyl proteases, which may severely hamper the development of small inhibitory molecules (14Hong L. Koelsch G. Lin X. Wu S. Terzyan S. Ghosh A.K. Zhang X.C. Tang J. Science.. 2000; 290: 150-153Google Scholar). On the other hand, targeting of BACE1 mRNA by small interfering RNAs has proven to be effective in down-regulating BACE1 protein levels and activity in cultured primary cortical neurons (15Kao S.C. Krichevsky A.M. Kosik K.S. Tsai L.H. J. Biol. Chem.. 2004; 279: 1942-1949Google Scholar) as well as in a mouse model of AD (16Singer O. Marr R.A. Rockenstein E. Crews L. Coufal N.G. Gage F.H. Verma I.M. Masliah E. Nat. Neurosci.. 2005; 8: 1343-1349Google Scholar). Although these findings suggest a potential therapeutic use for small interfering RNAs in treating AD, they also imply a certain degree of accessibility of BACE1 mRNA to the endogenous RNA silencing machinery, which is based on microRNAs (miRNAs). miRNAs are key regulatory RNAs known to initially repress mRNA translation through recognition of specific binding sites (BS) located mainly in their 3′-untranslated region (UTR) (for a recent review, see Ref. 17Ouellet D.L. Perron M.P. Gobeil L.A. Plante P. Provost P. J. Biomed. Biotechnol.. 2006; 2006: 69616Google Scholar). Encoded in the genome of almost all living eukaryotes, miRNA genes are transcribed by RNA polymerase II (18Lee Y. Kim M. Han J. Yeom K.H. Lee S. Baek S.H. Kim V.N. EMBO J.. 2004; 23: 4051-4060Google Scholar) into primary miRNA transcripts, which are then processed by Drosha (19Lee Y. Ahn C. Han J. Choi H. Kim J. Yim J. Lee J. Provost P. Radmark O. Kim S. Kim V.N. Nature.. 2003; 425: 415-419Google Scholar) into miRNA precursors (pre-miRNAs). After being exported to the cytoplasm by the Ran-GTP-dependent nuclear transporter Exportin-5 (20Lund E. Guttinger S. Calado A. Dahlberg J.E. Kutay U. Science.. 2004; 303: 95-98Google Scholar), these imperfectly paired stem-loop precursors are trimmed by the ribonuclease III Dicer into miRNA:miRNA* duplexes (21Provost P. Dishart D. Doucet J. Frendewey D. Samuelsson B. Radmark O. EMBO J.. 2002; 21: 5864-5874Google Scholar, 22Zhang H. Kolb F.A. Jaskiewicz L. Westhof E. Filipowicz W. Cell.. 2004; 118: 57-68Google Scholar). In most cases, although the nonfunctional miRNA strand (miRNA*) is encountered much less frequently and is presumably degraded (23Bartel D.P. Cell.. 2004; 116: 281-297Google Scholar), the miRNA strand is loaded into the effector ribonucleoprotein complexes, guiding them toward the target mRNAs to be regulated (24Zamore P.D. Haley B. Science.. 2005; 309: 1519-1524Google Scholar, 25Kim V.N. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol.. 2005; 6: 376-385Google Scholar). miRNAs have been implicated in tissue morphogenesis and in various cellular processes such as cell differentiation and proliferation, apoptosis, and major signaling pathways (26Kloosterman W.P. Plasterk R.H. Dev. Cell.. 2006; 11: 441-450Google Scholar). Emerging evidence suggests a direct link between miRNAs and diseases, some of which may be caused by impairment of the miRNA-guided RNA silencing machinery itself. This may be the case for the fragile X syndrome, which is the most frequent cause of inherited mental retardation. The fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP), whose loss represents the etiologic factor of the related syndrome (27O'Donnell W.T. Warren S.T. Annu. Rev. Neurosci.. 2002; 25: 315-338Google Scholar), has been reported to be part of an ribonucleoprotein complex harboring miRNAs. Our studies unveiled that FMRP has the ability to accept miRNA products derived from Dicer and to facilitate miRNA assembly on specific target RNA sequences (28Plante I. Davidovic L. Ouellet D.L. Gobeil L.A. Tremblay S. Khandjian E.W. Provost P. J. Biomed. Biotechnol.. 2006; 2006: 64347Google Scholar). These findings led us to propose that suboptimal utilization of miRNAs, i.e. miRNA:mRNA assembly and/or disassembly, may account for some of the molecular defects in patients with the fragile X syndrome (29Plante I. Provost P. J. Biomed. Biotechnol.. 2006; 2006: 16806Google Scholar). Disease may also arise from the loss of miRNA control of a specific gene. Although up to 92% of the genes in mammals could be subjected to miRNA regulation (30Miranda K.C. Huynh T. Tay Y. Ang Y.S. Tam W.L. Thomson A.M. Lim B. Rigoutsos I. Cell.. 2006; 126: 1203-1217Google Scholar), only a few miRNA:mRNA target pairs have been studied in detail. Among the disease-related genes that we examined, we were intrigued by BACE1 and the described features of a possible loss of post-transcriptional control in the brain of deceased AD patients. Indeed, previous studies had reported that BACE1 protein levels and activity were up-regulated in brains from patients suffering from AD, as compared with brains from unaffected patients, with BACE1 mRNA levels remaining unchanged (31Holsinger R.M. McLean C.A. Beyreuther K. Masters C.L. Evin G. Ann. Neurol.. 2002; 51: 783-786Google Scholar, 32Fukumoto H. Cheung B.S. Hyman B.T. Irizarry M.C. Arch. Neurol.. 2002; 59: 1381-1389Google Scholar, 33Yang L.B. Lindholm K. Yan R. Citron M. Xia W. Yang X.L. Beach T. Sue L. Wong P. Price D. Li R. Shen Y. Nat. Med.. 2003; 9: 3-4Google Scholar). These observations prompted us to hypothesize that BACE1 expression is under the control of miRNAs. Animals and Histology—Transgenic animals harboring the human presenilin 1 (A246E variant) and a chimeric mouse/human β-amyloid precursor protein (APPSwe) were originally obtained from The Jackson Laboratory (B6C3-Tg(APP695)3Dbo Tg(PSEN1)5Dbo/J; The Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, ME). This colony is maintained in a C57BL/6J background. WT and transgenic mice were acclimated to standard laboratory conditions (14-h light, 10-h dark cycle; lights on at 06:00 and off at 20:00 h) with free access to rodent chow and water. All protocols were conducted according to the Canadian Council on Animal Care guidelines, as administered by the Laval University Animal Welfare Committee. To collect the brain tissues at different ages, mice were deeply anesthetized via an intraperitoneal injection of a mixture of ketamine hydrochloride and xylazine and then rapidly perfused transcardially with 0.9% saline, followed by 4% paraformaldehyde, 3.8% Borax in sodium phosphate buffer (pH 9.0 at 4 °C). Brains were rapidly removed from the skulls, post-fixed overnight, and then placed in a solution containing 10% sucrose diluted in 4% paraformaldehyde, 3.8% Borax buffer, pH 9.0, overnight at 4 °C. The frozen brains were mounted on a microtome (Reichert-Jung, Cambridge Instruments Co., Deerfield, IL), frozen with dry ice, and cut into 25-μm coronal sections from the olfactory bulb to the end of the medulla. The slices were collected in a cold cryoprotectant solution (0.05 m sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.3, 30% ethylene glycol, 20% glycerol) and stored at –20 °C. BACE1 protein and mRNA were detected via immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization (ISH), respectively (34Laflamme N. Rivest S. J. Neurochem.. 1999; 73: 309-321Google Scholar). We used a full-length BACE1 cDNA (cloned by PCR) and antibody (PC529, 1/1000 dilution, Calbiochem) for ISH and immunohistochemistry, respectively. For the determination of mBACE1 mRNA and protein levels of expression, we used the ImageJ software (rsb.info.nih.gov) to select the hippocampal region, including the dentate gyrus, and we determined both optical densities and area of expression. miR-298 and miR-328 were detected by ISH by using the same protocol with probes that were of perfect complementarity to either miRNAs. The optical densities on film were determined using the ImageJ software. Cell Culture—Neuroblastoma N2a murine cells were grown in complete DMEM, i.e. supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 1 mm l-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. NIH 3T3 murine cells were grown in complete DMEM containing 10% calf bovine serum, whereas mouse embryonic Fmr1 KO (STEK TSV-40) and WT (Naives) fibroblasts (28Plante I. Davidovic L. Ouellet D.L. Gobeil L.A. Tremblay S. Khandjian E.W. Provost P. J. Biomed. Biotechnol.. 2006; 2006: 64347Google Scholar) were grown in complete DMEM containing 2 mm l-glutamine. All cell lines were grown and maintained in tissue culture plates and incubated at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2. The cells were kept in the exponential growth phase and subcultured every 3–4 days. Plasmid Constructs—The sequence encoding the precursors of mmu-miR-298 (pre-miR-298), mmu-miR-328 (pre-miR-328), and mmu-miR-105 (pre-miR-105) were cloned in the psiSTRIKE vector (Promega), according to the manufacturer's protocol. The sequences of the complete 3′-UTR of mouse BACE1 (nt 1932–3855, NCBI accession number BC048189), the partial 3′-UTR of mouse BACE1 (nt 2175–2374; miRNA BS module), and the complete 3′-UTR of mouse BACE2 (nt 2784–3614, NCBI accession number NM_019517) were amplified by PCR and introduced downstream of the Rluc reporter gene in the XhoI/NotI cloning sites of the psiCHECK vector (Promega). Mutations in the miRNA BS module of BACE1 were introduced by whole plasmid amplification in the seed region of both miR-298 and/or miR-328 BS (298mut, 328mut, and 298mut + 328mut). A reporter construct bearing a downstream miR-328 target sequence was also engineered by introducing a single copy of a sequence perfectly complementary to miR-328 in the XhoI/NotI cloning sites of psiCHECK. PCR fragments containing one or three copies of miR-298 or miR-328 natural BS were blunt-ligated downstream of the Rluc coding region in psiCHECK reporter vector. All the constructs were confirmed by restriction analysis and DNA sequencing. Cell Transfection and Dual-Luciferase Assay—For Dual-Luciferase assays, cells were cultured in 24-well plates and transfected at 70–80% confluency using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen), according to the manufacturer's protocol. Cells were transfected with psiCHECK alone (200 ng of DNA), psi-CHECK (400 ng of DNA), and psiSTRIKE (250 ng of DNA) or psiCHECK (400 ng of DNA) and miRNA duplexes (120 pmol), respectively. For Western blot analysis of BACE1 expression, cells grown in 6-well plates to at least 60% confluency were transfected with either miRNA duplexes (600 pmol) or 2′-OMe oligoribonucleotides (500 pmol). Cells confluent at 90% were transfected with psiSTRIKE (20 μg) by the calcium phosphate method. Cells transfected with the psiCHECK vector were lysed in 100 μl of passive lysis buffer (Promega), and the samples were analyzed on a luminometer, according to the manufacturer's instructions. Rluc values were normalized to Firefly luciferase (Fluc) readings, and the results were expressed as means ± S.E. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assays (EMSA)—Fragments harboring the natural miR-298 or miR-328 BS, either WT or mutated in their miRNA seed region (mut), were synthesized using T7 promoter-driven in vitro transcription (Megashort-script kit, Ambion). The DNA oligonucleotides were annealed to obtain the transcription modules. Five μg of each deoxyribonucleotide were solubilized in 50 μl of DNA annealing buffer (10 mm Tris·HCl, 100 mm NaCl, and 1 mm EDTA), heated to 95 °C for 5 min, and cooled down gradually to room temperature. The annealed oligonucleotides were precipitated with ethanol, resuspended in water, and used as templates for in vitro transcription reactions. RNAs were purified on a 10% polyacrylamide gel containing 7 m urea, eluted in elution buffer (0.5 m sodium acetate, 1 mm EDTA, and 0.2 m SDS), and ethanol-precipitated. The miRNA BS or tRNA control was incubated in the absence or presence of synthetic 32P-labeled miR-298 or miR-328 in reaction buffer composed of 20 mm Tris·HCl, 30 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm ZnCl2, 5 mm dithiothreitol, and 5% Superase-in, pH 7.0. miRNA-miRNA BS complex formation was monitored by 7.5% nondenaturing PAGE and autoradiography. miRNA Duplexes—The oligoribonucleotides miR-298, miR-328, and miR-196, and their miRNA* strands, were purchased from either Dharmacon or Integrated DNA Technologies. miRNA duplexes were reconstituted by coincubating equimolar ratios of mature miRNA and miRNA* strands in RNA annealing buffer (10 mm Tris·HCl, 20 mm NaCl, pH 8.0), heating at 95 °C for 5 min, and gradually cooling down to room temperature. miRNA duplex formation was ascertained by 7.5% nondenaturing PAGE and ultraviolet shadowing. Protein Extraction and Western Blot Analysis—Proteins were extracted by lysing cells in protein extraction buffer (40 mm Tris·HCl, 275 mm NaCl, 20% glycerol, 2% Igepal, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1× protease inhibitor mixture mix, pH 8.0) on ice for 15 min, prior to the addition of gel loading buffer and boiling of the samples for 5 min. Protein extracts (100 μg) were separated by 10% SDS-PAGE and transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, which was incubated in Tris-buffered saline containing 0.1% Tween 20 (TBST) and 5% dry milk at room temperature for 1 h. The membrane was then incubated in the presence of the primary antibody recognizing BACE1 (PC529, from Calbiochem) or actin (AC-40, from Sigma) for 1 h, washed three times with TBST, incubated with a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody for 1 h, and washed again three times with TBST. The signal was visualized by ECL (Amersham Biosciences). RNA Extraction and Northern Blot Analyses—Small RNA (< 200 nt) fractions were isolated by using the mirVana miRNA isolation kit (Ambion) from N2a and NIH 3T3 cells. RNA was separated on a 10% polyacrylamide gel containing 7 m urea, transferred to a nylon membrane followed by detection using a 32P-labeled probe complementary to miR-298 or miR-328, following the Northern blot procedure improved for the detection of small RNAs described previously by Pall et al. (35Pall G.S. Codony-Servat C. Byrne J. Ritchie L. Hamilton A. Nucleic Acids Res.. 2007; 35: e60Google Scholar). 5 S RNA was probed as a control. Loss of Post-transcriptional Regulation of BACE1 Expression in the Brain of APPSwe/PS1 Mice—To initiate our investigation as to whether miRNA-mediated translational repression could be involved in the regulation of BACE1 expression in vivo, BACE1 mRNA and protein levels were determined in the brain of aging mice. As depicted in Fig. 1, A and B, age-related variations in BACE1 mRNA levels were detected in the brain of APP and WT mice. Interestingly mRNA levels were higher in the brains of APPSwe/PS1 mice than those of WT littermates at 4 months of age, but these levels upturned in mice sacrificed 15 months later (Fig. 1, A and B). The switch in BACE1 gene expression in the hippocampus of aging APP and WT mice was not translated to the same tendency of changes at the protein level, which were measured in the same regions of adjacent sections (Fig. 1, C and D). Indeed, BACE1 protein levels increased with age in APP mice, whereas BACE1 mRNA levels declined. BACE1-immunoreactive regions also generally overlapped with those exhibiting senile plaques in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus of APP mice at 10 months of age. These anatomical features, which are similar to those observed in human (31Holsinger R.M. McLean C.A. Beyreuther K. Masters C.L. Evin G. Ann. Neurol.. 2002; 51: 783-786Google Scholar, 32Fukumoto H. Cheung B.S. Hyman B.T. Irizarry M.C. Arch. Neurol.. 2002; 59: 1381-1389Google Scholar, 33Yang L.B. Lindholm K. Yan R. Citron M. Xia W. Yang X.L. Beach T. Sue L. Wong P. Price D. Li R. Shen Y. Nat. Med.. 2003; 9: 3-4Google Scholar), are consistent with a possible loss or deregulation of translational repression of BACE1 mRNA mediated by miRNAs. Presence of Regulatory Elements in the 3′-UTR of Mouse BACE1—Because the regulatory elements recognized by miRNAs are usually located in the 3′-UTR of mRNAs, we examined the gene regulatory properties of BACE1 3′-UTR. For that purpose, this region was amplified and cloned downstream of a Renilla luciferase (Rluc) reporter gene, and assayed in transiently transfected N2a or NIH 3T3 cells. Incorporation of BACE1 3′-UTR reduced expression of the Rluc reporter gene by ∼70–80%, as compared with empty psiCHECK vector (set at 100%) (Fig. 2). No regulatory effects were conferred upon insertion of the corresponding region of BACE2 3′-UTR downstream of Rluc. These data suggest the presence of down-regulatory elements in the 3′-UTR of BACE1 mRNA. Putative miRNA-binding Sites Are Located in the 3′-UTR of BACE1 mRNA—Considering a recent report by Miranda et al. (30Miranda K.C. Huynh T. Tay Y. Ang Y.S. Tam W.L. Thomson A.M. Lim B. Rigoutsos I. Cell.. 2006; 126: 1203-1217Google Scholar) suggesting that up to 90% of the genes in mammals may be subjected to miRNA regulation, we inspected the 3′-UTR of BACE1 mRNA for the presence of putative BS for specific miRNAs. To this end, we utilized two different algorithms designed to identify miRNA-mRNA target interaction pairs that exhibit favorable free energies. As depicted in Fig. 3A, analysis of BACE1 mRNA 3′-UTR sequence with the DIANA-microT program identified two potential BS for miRNAs as follows: one for miR-298 (nts 2205–2230) and another for miR-328 (nts 2321–2346). This computational program uses a combination of bioinformatics and experimental approaches to define important rules that govern miRNA recognition of animal target mRNAs (36Kiriakidou M. Nelson P.T. Kouranov A. Fitziev P. Bouyioukos C. Mourelatos Z. Hatzigeorgiou A. Genes Dev.. 2004; 18: 1165-1178Google Scholar). Noticeably, both miR-298 and miR-328 showed perfect pairing of their seed region, i.e. nts 2–8 from their 5′ extremity, to their respective BS. Complementary pairing of the miRNA 3′ sequence further stabilizes target recognition, yielding highly favorable free energies for miR-298 (ΔG = –48.2 kcal/mol) and miR-328 (ΔG =–44.6 kcal/mol), respectively. As a comparison, these interactions are predicted to be of higher stability than that observed between the known let-7 miRNA:lin-41 mRNA pair (ΔG = –31.0 kcal/mol), which has been experimentally validated in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. These results have been confirmed by using another algorithm, RNAhybrid, which was initially conceived to find the minimum free energy hybridization between a long and a short RNA, and is primarily intended as a means for miRNA target prediction (37Rehmsmeier M. Steffen P. Hochsmann M. Giegerich R. RNA (N. Y.).. 2004; 10: 1507-1517Google Scholar). Using this tool, highly favorable free energies were again obtained for miR-298 (ΔG = –36.0 kcal/mol) and miR-328 (ΔG = –32.6 kcal/mol), respectively. Neither of these computational strategies could predict miRNA BS in the BACE2 mRNA 3′-UTR sequence. Next, to validate these predictions experimentally, we initially assessed whether miR-298 and miR-328 could interact with their respective BS in vitro by adapting and using EMSA, an established method commonly used to monitor perfectly paired oligonucleotides. For that purpose, synthetic 32P-labeled miR-298 and miR-328 were incubated in the absence or presence of their putative, in vitro-transcribed BS, and miRNA-miRNA BS complex formation was analyzed by EMSA. Although partially complementary, both miR-298 and miR-328 bound to their respective BS, as demonstrated by the formation of a slowly migrating complex (Fig. 3, B and C, left panels, lanes 2). No such complex was observed when the miRNA BS were swapped (Fig. 3, B and C, left panels, lanes 4). Moreover, mutation of the miRNA seed region disrupted miRNA: miRNA BS complex formation (Fig. 3, B and C, left panels, lanes 3). Although they did not interact with tRNA, used as a negative control, miR-298 and miR-328 bound to their respective BS in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 3, B and C, right panels, lanes 1–4). In addition, to demonstrate the suitability of EMSA to visualize imperfectly paired miRNA-miRNA BS complexes, as slower migrating bands on nondenaturing polyacrylamide gels, these results indicate that miR-298 and miR-328 are able to recognize their respective BS in the 3′-UTR of BACE1 mRNA. Pre-miR-328 Expression Exerts Gene Down-regulatory Effects in Cultured Neuronal Cells—To study the gene regulatory role of miR-298 and miR-328 in vivo, we engineered vectors aimed at expressing pre-miR-298 and pre-miR-328 in cultured neuronal N2a and NIH 3T3 cells. Insertion of the pre-miRNA sequences in psiSTRIKE implied their adaptation to the U6 promoter and terminator sequences, i.e. substitution for a G at the 5′ end of the pre-miRNA and a UU pair at its 3′ end, respectively (supplemental Fig. S1A). Vector-based expression of pre-miR-298 and pre-miR-328 was verified in transiently transfected N2a cells by Northern blot. Analysis of small RNAs isolated from these cells revealed detectable levels of pre-miR-328 and mature miR-328 (supplemental Fig. S1B), whereas neither pre-miR-298 nor miR-298 could be detected (data not shown). These observations indicate that the pre-miR-328 construct, in contrast to that encoding for pre-miR-298, is suitable for our studies and U6-mediated expression in cultured mammalian cells. We then focused and utilized the pre-miR-328 expression vector to confirm the functionality of an miRNA-guided RNA silencing machine in our cells. To this end, we monitored Rluc activity of the corresponding reporter constructs in cotransfected N2a and NIH 3T3 cells. Expression of the Rluc reporter gene coupled with a single BS perfectly complementary to miR-328 was decreased by more than 80% upon coexpression of pre-miR-328, as compared with that of an unrelated precursor control (Fig. 4A). The down-regulatory effects conferred by the single BS were not increased further by the presence of two additional BS (data not shown). These results support the existence of a functional miRNA-guided RNA silencing machinery in cultured N2a and NIH 3T3 cells. Functionality of the miRNA-binding Sites—miRNAs act in synergy, and mRNAs regulated by miRNAs often contain more than one miRNA BS. Furthermore, in mammalian cells, miRNA BS located in target mRNAs are recognized by miRNAs mainly through imperfect complementarity. To get closer to this situation, we gen"

Compelling evidence links miRNAs to the control of neuronal development and differentiation, however, little is known about their role in neurodegeneration. We used microarrays and RT-PCR to profile miRNA expression changes in the brains of mice infected with mouse-adapted scrapie. We determined 15 miRNAs were de-regulated during the disease processes; miR-342-3p, miR-320, let-7b, miR-328, miR-128, miR-139-5p and miR-146a were over 2.5 fold up-regulated and miR-338-3p and miR-337-3p over 2.5 fold down-regulated. Only one of these miRNAs, miR-128, has previously been shown to be de-regulated in neurodegenerative disease. De-regulation of a unique subset of miRNAs suggests a conserved, disease-specific pattern of differentially expressed miRNAs is associated with prion-induced neurodegeneration. Computational analysis predicted numerous potential gene targets of these miRNAs, including 119 genes previously determined to be also de-regulated in mouse scrapie. We used a co-ordinated approach to integrate miRNA and mRNA profiling, bioinformatic predictions and biochemical validation to determine miRNA regulated processes and genes potentially involved in disease progression. In particular, a correlation between miRNA expression and putative gene targets involved in intracellular protein-degradation pathways and signaling pathways related to cell death, synapse function and neurogenesis was identified."

https://openalex.org/W2106330911,"The nature of the 'dark matter' thought to form the bulk of the Universe remains obscure. One suggestion is that it is an elementary particle, perhaps the lightest supersymmetric partner of known particle species. If that were true, annihilation of dark matter in the halo of the Milky Way should produce γ-rays at a level that should soon be detectable. Where should we be looking for these γ-rays? Springel et al. report numerical simulations that suggest that the dominant and most easily detectable signal will be produced by diffuse dark matter in the main halo of the Milky Way. Previously it was thought that the annihilation signal might be dominated by emission from small clumps of dark matter near to our part of the galaxy, but this new work suggests that their contribution would be small. Dark matter is the dominant form of matter in the Universe, but its nature is unknown. It is plausibly an elementary particle, perhaps the lightest supersymmetric partner of known particle species1. In this case, annihilation of dark matter in the halo of the Milky Way should produce γ-rays at a level that may soon be observable2,3. Previous work has argued that the annihilation signal will be dominated by emission from very small clumps4,5 (perhaps smaller even than the Earth), which would be most easily detected where they cluster together in the dark matter haloes of dwarf satellite galaxies6. Here we report that such small-scale structure will, in fact, have a negligible impact on dark matter detectability. Rather, the dominant and probably most easily detectable signal will be produced by diffuse dark matter in the main halo of the Milky Way7,8. If the main halo is strongly detected, then small dark matter clumps should also be visible, but may well contain no stars, thereby confirming a key prediction of the cold dark matter model."

Here, the seven-domain transmembrane protein Smoothened (Smo) is shown to activate a G protein, Gαi, to modulate intracellular cyclic AMP levels in response to Hh. Whether G proteins have a role in hedgehog (Hh) signal transduction has been controversial. In this study, Smoothened (Smo) is shown to activate a G protein, Gαi, to modulate intracellular cyclic AMP levels in response to Hh. The hedgehog (Hh) signalling pathway has an evolutionarily conserved role in patterning fields of cells during metazoan development, and is inappropriately activated in cancer1,2. Hh pathway activity is absolutely dependent on signalling by the seven-transmembrane protein smoothened (Smo), which is regulated by the Hh receptor patched (Ptc). Smo signals to an intracellular multi-protein complex containing the Kinesin related protein Costal2 (Cos2), the protein kinase Fused (Fu) and the transcription factor Cubitus interruptus (Ci)3. In the absence of Hh, this complex regulates the cleavage of full-length Ci to a truncated repressor protein, Ci75, in a process that is dependent on the proteasome and priming phosphorylations by Protein kinase A (PKA)4. Binding of Hh to Ptc blocks Ptc-mediated Smo inhibition, allowing Smo to signal to the intracellular components to attenuate Ci cleavage. Because of its homology with the Frizzled family of G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCR)5, a likely candidate for an immediate Smo effector would be a heterotrimeric G protein. However, the role that G proteins may have in Hh signal transduction is unclear and quite controversial6,7,8,9,10, which has led to widespread speculation that Smo signals through a variety of novel G-protein-independent mechanisms. Here we present in vitro and in vivo evidence in Drosophila that Smo activates a G protein to modulate intracellular cyclic AMP levels in response to Hh. Our results demonstrate that Smo functions as a canonical GPCR, which signals through Gαi to regulate Hh pathway activation."

We previously demonstrated that bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) 9 is one of the most potent and yet least characterized BMPs that are able to induce osteogenic differentiation of MSCs both in vitro and in vivo. Here, we conducted gene expression-profiling analysis and identified that Hey1 of the hairy/Enhancer of split-related repressor protein basic helix-loop-helix family was among the most significantly up-regulated early targets in BMP9-stimulated MSCs. We demonstrated that Hey1 expression was up-regulated at the immediate early stage of BMP9-induced osteogenic differentiation. Chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis indicated that Hey1 may be a direct target of the BMP9-induced Smad signaling pathway. Silencing Hey1 expression diminished BMP9-induced osteogenic differentiation both in vitro and in vivo and led to chondrogenic differentiation. Likewise, constitutive Hey1 expression augmented BMP9-mediated bone matrix mineralization. Hey1 and Runx2 were shown to act synergistically in BMP9-induced osteogenic differentiation, and Runx2 expression significantly decreased in the absence of Hey1, suggesting that Runx2 may function downstream of Hey1. Accordingly, the defective osteogenic differentiation caused by Hey1 knockdown was rescued by exogenous Runx2 expression.

BMP9 (also known as GDF2) was originally identified from fetal mouse liver cDNA libraries and is a relatively uncharacterized member of the BMP family. BMP9 is highly expressed in the developing mouse liver, and recombinant human BMP9 stimulates hepatocyte proliferation (22Song J.J. Celeste A.J. Kong F.M. Jirtle R.L. Rosen V. Thies R.S.

However, the molecular mechanism behind BMP9-regulated MSC differentiation remains to be elucidated. In this study, we investigated the mechanism underlying BMP9-regulated osteoblast lineage-specific differentiation of MSCs. Through gene expression-profiling analysis, we identified that Hey1 (also known as Hesr1, HRT1, CHF2, and HERP2), a transcription factor of the HERP family (26Leimeister C. Externbrink A. Klamt B. Gessler M. Mech. Dev. 1999; 85: 173-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar), is among the most significantly up-regulated targets in MSCs in response to BMP9. The HERP family of basic helix-loop-helix transcription factors is a direct target of the Notch signaling pathway (27Iso T. Kedes L. Hamamori Y. J. Cell. Physiol. 2003; 194: 237-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (1012) Google Scholar), which is implicated in cell fate decision. Although Hey1 is up-regulated in early somitogenesis (26Leimeister C. Externbrink A. Klamt B. Gessler M. Mech. Dev. 1999; 85: 173-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar), the role of Hey1 in osteoblast differentiation is unclear. One study demonstrated that Hey1 is specifically up-regulated by BMP2 when MSCs differentiate to osteoblast lineage (28de Jong D.S. Vaes B.L. Dechering K.J. Feijen A. Hendriks J.M. Wehrens R. Mummery C.L. van Zoelen E.J. Olijve W. Steegenga W.T. J. Bone Miner Res. 2004; 19: 947-958Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), whereas another study showed that Hey1 inhibited osteoblast maturation via interaction with Runx2, a known regulator of osteogenic differentiation (29Zamurovic N. Cappellen D. Rohner D. Susa M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 37704-37715Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). We sought to determine the functional role of Hey1 in BMP9-induced osteogenic differentiation. We demonstrated that Hey1 is an important and direct target of BMP-9 signaling and is up-regulated at the immediate early stage of osteogenic differentiation. Silencing Hey1 expression reduced BMP9-stimulated osteogenic differentiation both in vitro and in vivo. Hey1 overexpression in MSCs increased BMP9-stimulated osteogenic differentiation in vitro, and enhanced mineralization of bone matrix in response to BMP9 in vivo. We further demonstrated that Hey1 and Runx2 act synergistically in BMP9-induced osteogenic differentiation and that exogenous expression of Runx2 provides a partial rescue of the Hey1 knockdown phenotype. Thus, our results suggest that Hey1 may play an important role in mediating BMP9-induced MSC differentiation.

The acquired microarray raw data were further filtered and normalized to remove noise, whereas retaining true biological information by filtering out the genes with signal intensity in all samples <100 intensity units, and by removing the genes that received an “absent” call for all hybridizations. The clustering analysis was carried out by using the DNA-Chip Analyzer (dChip) software (51McLarren K.W. Lo R. Grbavec D. Thirunavukkarasu K. Karsenty G. Stifani S. J. Biol.

Thresholds for selecting significant genes were set at a relative difference >2-fold, an absolute difference >100 signal intensity units, and a statistical difference at p < 0.05 (supplemental Table S1). Establishment of Stable MSC Lines Expressing Hey1—We PCR-amplified and cloned the mouse Hey1 coding region into a retroviral vector that also conferred resistance to blasticidin, designated RV-Hey1. The cloning regions and PCR-amplified coding regions were verified by DNA sequencing. The RV-Hey1 vector was transfected into a retroviral packaging line (empty vector as a control), and the recombinant retrovirus was used to infect C3H10T1/2 cells followed by blasticidin selection. The resultant stable pooled clones were designated as C3H10-Hey1. Overexpression of Hey1 in this line was verified by qPCR. Construction details are available upon request.

Ten micrograms of total RNA was used to generate cDNA templates by reverse transcription with hexamer and Superscript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen). The first strand cDNA products were further diluted 5- to 10-fold and used as qPCR templates. The qPCR primers (supplemental Table S2) were 18-mers, designed by using the Primer3 program, frodo.wi.mit.edu/cgi-bin/primer3/primer3_www.cgi, to amplify the 3′-end (∼120 bp) of the gene of interest. SYBR Green-based qPCR analysis was carried out using the Opticon DNA Engine (MJ Research). The specificity of each qPCR reaction was verified by melting curve analysis and further confirmed by resolving the PCR products on 1.5% agarose gels. pUC19, 5-fold serially diluted, was used as a standard. Duplicate reactions were carried out for each sample. All samples were normalized by the expression level of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase.

Stem Cell Implantation—The use and care of animals was approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. Subconfluent C3H10T1/2 control line, C3H10-Hey1, and C3H10-Hey1KD cells were infected with AdBMP9, AdGFP, or co-infected with AdBMP9, AdRunx2, or AdHey1 for 15 h, and collected for subcutaneous injection (5 × 106 cells per injection) into the flanks of athymic nude (nu/nu) mice (four injections per group, 4- to 6-week-old, male, Harlan Sprague-Dawley). At 6 weeks after implantation, animals were sacrificed for MicroCT imaging, and the implantation sites were retrieved for histologic evaluation. A similar procedure was followed for the MEF implantation experiments, except that the MEFs were infected with Ad-simHey1 or AdHey1. ChIP Analysis—Subconfluent C3H10T1/2 cells were infected with AdGFP or AdBMP9. At 30 h after infection, cells were cross-linked and subjected to ChIP analysis as previously described (31Si W. Kang Q.

Smad4 antibody, Smad1/5/8 antibody, or control IgG was used to pull down the protein-DNA complexes. The presence of Hey1 promoter sequence was detected by PCR using three pairs of primers corresponding to mouse Hey1 promoter region. MicroCT Imaging Analysis—Animals were sacrificed at end-points and subjected to a high performance MicroCT imager that has a spatial resolution of 10-50 μm and a high contrast resolution. This unit provides quantitative measurements regarding the number and volume of each mass in each animal. MicroCT data were acquired and reconstructed into a three-dimensional image, and bone mass was quantified. To calculate the volume of each mass, the ImageJ program was used to determine the surface area of each planar slice of the MicroCT, the surface areas were summed, and volume was calculated as [(sum of the surface area of each slice) * 0.0543]. These volumes were averaged by dividing by the number of samples for each respective injection condition (n = 4). Hematoxylin and Eosin, Trichrome, and Alcian Blue Staining—Retrieved tissues were fixed in 10% formalin overnight and embedded in paraffin. Serial sections of the embedded specimens were stained with hematoxylin and eosin. Trichrome and Alcian Blue stains were carried out as previously described (18Kang Q. Sun M.H. Cheng H. Peng Y.

Hey1 Is Among the Most Significantly Up-regulated Targets of BMP9-induced Osteogenic Differentiation of MSCs—We recently evaluated the role of BMPs in regulating MSC differentiation and demonstrated that among the 14 BMPs, BMP9 is one of the most potent osteoinductive BMPs both in vitro and in vivo (17Cheng H. Jiang W. Phillips F.M. Haydon R.C. Peng Y. Zhou L. Luu H.H. An N. Breyer B. Vanichakarn P. Szatkowski J.P. Park J.Y. He T.C. J. Bone Joint Surg.

To gain further insight into the molecular basis of BMP9-mediated osteogenic differentiation of MSCs, we performed an expression profiling analysis of ∼22,000 genes in C3H10T1/2 MSCs stimulated with BMP9 or the GFP control. C3H10T1/2 cells are commonly used and well characterized MSCs (6Luu H.H. Song W.X. Luo X. Manning D. Luo J. Deng Z.L. Sharff K.A. Montag A.G. Haydon R.C. He T.C. J. Orthop.

Using the dChip analysis under a high stringency (>2.0-fold and p < 0.05), we found that 40 genes were most significantly regulated in MSCs upon BMP9 stimulation; 30 genes were up-regulated and 10 were down-regulated (Fig. 1, A and B, and supplemental Table S1). This dChip analysis indicated that the Hey1 gene was among the most significantly up-regulated genes in response to BMP9 (Fig. 1B). To verify that Hey1 was induced by BMP9 in MSCs, C3H10T1/2 cells were infected with an adenovirus expressing BMP9 or GFP (AdBMP9 and AdGFP), and total RNA was collected at 1, 3, 5, and 7 days after infection. Using qPCR, we demonstrated that Hey1 expression was up-regulated by BMP9, and Hey1 expression level increased 5-fold, 6-fold, and 10-fold at days 1, 3, and 5, with a trend returning toward basal levels after 7 days. By day 7, BMP9-stimulated MSCs are usually committed to pre-osteoblast or early osteoblasts as indicated by the elevated ALP activity, a well established early osteogenic marker (Fig. 1C). Interestingly, although closely related, Hey2 gene expression was not significantly affected by BMP9 (data not shown). Thus, our results indicate that Hey1 expression is significantly induced at the immediate early stage of BMP9 stimulation in MSCs. ChIP Analys"

https://openalex.org/W2033843609,"The recent emergence of highly pathogenic avian (H5N1) influenza viruses, their epizootic and panzootic nature, and their association with lethal human infections have raised significant global health concerns. Several studies have underlined the importance of non-structural protein NS1 in the increased pathogenicity and virulence of these strains. NS1, which consists of two domains-a double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) binding domain and the effector domain, separated through a linker-is an antagonist of antiviral type-I interferon response in the host. Here we report the X-ray structure of the full-length NS1 from an H5N1 strain (A/Vietnam/1203/2004) that was associated with 60% of human deaths in an outbreak in Vietnam. Compared to the individually determined structures of the RNA binding domain and the effector domain from non-H5N1 strains, the RNA binding domain within H5N1 NS1 exhibits modest structural changes, while the H5N1 effector domain shows significant alteration, particularly in the dimeric interface. Although both domains in the full-length NS1 individually participate in dimeric interactions, an unexpected finding is that these interactions result in the formation of a chain of NS1 molecules instead of distinct dimeric units. Three such chains in the crystal interact with one another extensively to form a tubular organization of similar dimensions to that observed in the cryo-electron microscopy images of NS1 in the presence of dsRNA. The tubular oligomeric organization of NS1, in which residues implicated in dsRNA binding face a 20-A-wide central tunnel, provides a plausible mechanism for how NS1 sequesters varying lengths of dsRNA, to counter cellular antiviral dsRNA response pathways, while simultaneously interacting with other cellular ligands during an infection."
https://openalex.org/W2095544855,"Tic110 has been proposed to be a channel-forming protein at the inner envelope of chloroplasts whose function is essential for the import of proteins synthesized in the cytosol. Sequence features and topology determination experiments presently summarized suggest that Tic110 consists of six transmembrane helices. Its topology has been mapped by limited proteolysis experiments in combination with mass spectrometric determinations and cysteine modification analysis. Two hydrophobic transmembrane helices located in the N terminus serve as a signal for the localization of the protein to the membrane as shown previously. The other amphipathic transmembrane helices are located in the region composed of residues 92–959 in the pea sequence. This results in two regions in the intermembrane space localized to form supercomplexes with the TOC machinery and to receive the transit peptide of preproteins. A large region also resides in the stroma for interaction with proteins such as molecular chaperones. In addition to characterizing the topology of Tic110, we show that Ca2+ has a dramatic effect on channel activity in vitro and that the protein has a redox-active disulfide with the potential to interact with stromal thioredoxin.

After the proposed endosymbiotic event that gave rise to chloroplasts and, as a consequence, to the massive transfer of genes from the endosymbiont to the host cell nucleus, two new machineries were developed at the outer and inner envelope of chloroplasts, the TOC and TIC complexes, respectively. The machineries transport plastid proteins, whose synthesis was moved to the cytosol, back to the plastid (for a review, see Refs. 1Jarvis P. New Phytol.. 2008; 179: 257-285Google Scholar and 2Stengel A. Soil J. Bolter B. Biol. Chem... 2007; 388: 765-772Google Scholar). Whereas the channel of the TOC complex is homologous to the Omp85 family of transporters in bacteria (3Bolter B. Soll J. Schulz A. Hinnah S. Wagner R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A... 1998; 95: 15831-15836Google Scholar), the TIC complex shows no homology to known transport systems, since the plasma membrane-bacterial transport machineries were relocated to the thylakoid membrane. Moreover, there was an essential requirement for establishing new lines of communication between the organelle and other parts of the cell (4Pesaresi P. Schneider A. Kleine T. Leister D. Curr. Opin. Plant Biol... 2007; 10: 600-606Google Scholar). In chloroplasts of land plants, redox regulation is linked to oxygen and/or light. The regulation of chloroplast-specific processes by redox in accord with the status of the organelle applies not only for transcription and translation but also for translocation. Redox regulation at the translocation level has been proposed for the TIC machinery on the basis of protein composition and dynamics (5Chigri F. Hormann F. Stamp A. Stammers D.K. Bolter B. Soll J.

Chem... 2008; 283: 6656-6667Google Scholar) as well as specific in vitro import experiments (9Hirohashi T. Hase T. Nakai M. Plant Physiol... 2001; 125: 2154-2163Google Scholar). However, despite advances in our biochemical understanding of the import process, little is presently known regarding details of the role of redox or of the structure of the TIC complex, particularly with respect to its channel subunits. Tic110 is essential for protein import into plastids (10Schnell D.J. Kessler F. Blobel G. Science.. 1994; 266: 1007-1012Google Scholar, 11Wu C.B. Seibert F.S. Ko K. J. Biol. Chem... 1994; 269: 32264-32271Google Scholar, 12Inaba T. Alvarez-Huerta M. Li M. Bauer J. Ewers C. Kessler F. Schnell D.J. Plant Cell.. 2005; 17: 1482-1496Google Scholar). It has been proposed to be a pore-forming protein and one of the main components of the TIC complex (13Heins L. Mehrle A. Hemmler R. Wagner R. Kuchler M. Hormann F. Sveshnikov D. Soll J. EMBO J.. 2002; 21: 2616-2625Google Scholar). Previous studies have provided information about certain aspects of Tic110 structure-function. The region from residue 93 to 602 (Arabidopsis sequence) is involved in the formation of joint translocation sites between the TOC and the TIC complex (12Inaba T. Alvarez-Huerta M. Li M. Bauer J. Ewers C. Kessler F. Schnell D.J. Plant Cell.. 2005; 17: 1482-1496Google Scholar). Part of the region (residues 185–370 in Arabidopsis sequence) contains a binding site for the transit peptide (14Inaba T. Li M. Alvarez-Huerta M. Kessler F. Schnell D.J. J. Biol. Chem... 2003; 278: 38617-38627Google Scholar). In addition, Tic110 coordinates the chaperone complex system in the stroma in order to complete the translocation process. The protein forms a ternary complex with Tic40 and Hsp93, and at least certain of the Tic110 residues (331–553 and 602–966, Arabidopsis sequence) are implicated in the binding (12Inaba T. Alvarez-Huerta M. Li M. Bauer J. Ewers C. Kessler F. Schnell D.J. Plant Cell.. 2005; 17: 1482-1496Google Scholar). The interaction with Tic32, a proposed redox- and Ca2+-regulated member of the TIC machinery, was localized to the N-terminal region of Tic110 (residues 39–231 in pea) (7Hormann F. Kuchler M. Sveshnikov D. Oppermann U. Li Y. Soll J. J. Biol. Chem... 2004; 279: 34756-34762Google Scholar). Electrophysiological characterization of a truncated version of Tic110 that lacks the two hydrophobic transmembrane helices at the N terminus (Tic110ΔN) in reconstituted planar lipid bilayers revealed properties of a cation-selective channel, sensitive to chloroplast transit peptides (13Heins L. Mehrle A. Hemmler R. Wagner R. Kuchler M. Hormann F. Sveshnikov D. Soll J. EMBO J.. 2002; 21: 2616-2625Google Scholar). Two different models have been proposed to explain the topology of Tic110. The models agree on the arrangement of the two hydrophobic transmembrane helices located at the N terminus, which have been shown to contain essential information on localizing the protein to the inner envelope membrane (15Lubeck J. Soll J. Akita M. Nielsen E. Keegstra K. EMBO J.. 1996; 15: 4230-4238Google Scholar), but they disagree on Tic110ΔN protein organization. Whereas one model considers that it resides in the chloroplast stroma, the other proposes that certain loops lie in the intermembrane space. The first model was developed from evidence obtained with a truncated C-terminal protein expressed in soluble form in Escherichia coli (14Inaba T. Li M. Alvarez-Huerta M. Kessler F. Schnell D.J. J. Biol. Chem... 2003; 278: 38617-38627Google Scholar) and limited proteolysis studies carried out with isolated chloroplast and inner envelope membrane preparations (16Jackson D.T. Froehlich J.E. Keegstra K. J. Biol. Chem... 1998; 273: 16583-16588Google Scholar). The same experiments performed by our group, however, led to different conclusions (13Heins L. Mehrle A. Hemmler R. Wagner R. Kuchler M. Hormann F. Sveshnikov D. Soll J. EMBO J.. 2002; 21: 2616-2625Google Scholar, 15Lubeck J. Soll J. Akita M. Nielsen E. Keegstra K. EMBO J.. 1996; 15: 4230-4238Google Scholar). The electrochemical properties of Tic110 in lipid bilayers firmly support the second model. In view of present discrepancies, a more systematic analysis of the topology of Tic110 is clearly timely. Herein, we provide evidence that supports the electrophysiological features of Tic110 as a channel and, in addition, show that Ca2+ has a dramatic effect on Tic110 channel activity. Experimental and computational methods have been combined to map the topology of the protein at the inner envelope membrane of pea chloroplasts and to obtain useful structural insight. Based on these analyses, we propose a model in which Tic110ΔN has four amphipathic transmembrane segments. This would lead to two large regions located in the intermembrane space of chloroplasts and a large component in the stroma. The model reconciles the experimental results published so far on Tic110. Interestingly, six conserved Cys in the Tic110 sequence of vascular plants are positioned in the stromal compartment where they have the potential to undergo regulation via thioredoxin (Trx). 2The abbreviations used are: Trx, thioredoxin; AMS, 4-acetamido-4′-maleimidylstilbene-2,2′-disulfonic acid; DDM, n-dodecyl-β-d-maltoside; IEV, inner envelope vesicles; IMS, intermembrane space; MS, mass spectrometry; TCEP, Tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine; PEG-MAL, metoxypolyethylenglycol-maleimide; SEC, size exclusion chromatography; Mops, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid; Tricine, N-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl) ethyl]glycine; DTT, dithiothreitol; pS, picosiemens; BisTris, 2-[bis-(2-hydroxyethyl)amino]-2-(hydroxymethyl)propane-1,3-diol. Bacteria and Plasmids—Pisum sativum Tic110 (psTic110, residues 1–959) cloning and transformation were previously described (15Lubeck J. Soll J. Akita M. Nielsen E. Keegstra K. EMBO J.. 1996; 15: 4230-4238Google Scholar). The coding region of the C-terminal region of the Tic110 protein from pea (psTic110ΔN, residues 96–959) was amplified by PCR (15Lubeck J. Soll J. Akita M. Nielsen E. Keegstra K. EMBO J.. 1996; 15: 4230-4238Google Scholar) and cloned into pET21d. The plasmids were transformed into BL21(DE3) E. coli cells. Protein Purification—psTic110 was overexpressed in E. coli as inclusion bodies. The protein was purified in-batch by Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid (Amersham Biosciences) in 20 mm Tris-HCl, 500 mm NaCl, 250 mm imidazol, 8 m urea, pH 7.9. The purified protein was refolded by dilution in 50 mm Tris-HCl, 250 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.03% n-dodecyl-β-d-maltoside (DDM), pH 7.9, concentrated, and run over a size exclusion column (Superdex 200; Amersham). In the case of psTic110ΔN, the soluble fraction after cell disruption was applied to a His-Trap HP column (Amersham Biosciences), which was equilibrated with 20 mm Tris-HCl, 300 mm NaCl, pH 7.9. The protein was eluted with 100 mm imidazol and applied to a Superdex 200 column. Size exclusion chromatography (Superose 6; Amersham) coupled to static light scattering (SLS) was used in complementation to 6.5–12% Blue Native-polyacrylamide gels to test the oligomerization state of the psTic110ΔN protein. Isolation of Inner Envelope Vesicles—Membrane fractions enriched in right side-out inner envelope vesicles (IEV) of chloroplast membranes were isolated from intact chloroplasts from 10–12-day-old pea plants as described previously (17Waegemann K. Soll J. Methods Cell Biol... 1995; 50: 255-267Google Scholar). The native Tic110 band was excised after SDS-PAGE, and protein was eluted from gel pieces in the presence of 80 mm nonanoyl-N-methylglucamide before reconstitution into liposomes. Proteoliposome Preparation and Flotation Assay—Lipid vesicles (PC, fraction IV, azolectin; Sigma) were prepared as previously reported (18Vojta A. Scheuring J. Neumaier N. Mirus O. Weinkauf S. Schleiff E. Anal. Biochem... 2005; 347: 24-33Google Scholar) in buffer containing 10 mm Mops/Tris, 100 mm NaCl, pH 7.0, 1% SDS. Liposome-associated and liposome-free proteins were separated by flotation through a sucrose gradient. The proteoliposome and the liposome-free protein sample were adjusted to a sucrose concentration of 1.6 m (2 ml) and overlaid with 9 ml of a step sucrose gradient (0.8, 0.4, 0.2, and 0.1 m). The samples were centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 19 h at 4 °C. 1-ml fractions were collected and precipitated with trichloroacetic acid. The samples were resuspended in Laemmli buffer and analyzed by SDS-PAGE (10% gel) and stained with silver. Electrophysiological Measurements—Small unilamellar liposomes were obtained from purified phosphatidylcholine (from egg, Larodan Fine Chemicals AB) by dissolving 20 mg/ml in 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm Mops/Tris, pH 7, and then sonicating in a water bath for 30 s (300H Omnilab Laborzentrum GmbH & Co. KG). Nonanoyl-N-methylglucamide was added up to a final concentration of 80 mm prior to the addition of an equal volume of protein-containing eluate (concentrated to approximately 1 mg of protein/ml). The mixture was incubated for 1.5 h at room temperature and subsequently dialyzed against 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm Mops/Tris, pH 7, for 22 h. The planar lipid bilayer measurements were performed as described previously (19Goetze T.A. Philippar K. Ilkavets I. Soll J. Wagner R. J. Biol. Chem... 2006; 281: 17989-17998Google Scholar). For a compilation of a representative current-voltage relationship of gating events, the difference of the respective current levels (open and more closed state) was taken from nine independent bilayers (approximately 1380 gating events). These data were classified and averaged based on a statistical presentation in a histogram. Limited Proteolysis Assays in IEV—Ten μg of IEV were resuspended in 10 μl of buffer (50 mm Tricine-KOH, pH 8.5, 0.1 mm CaCl2) and treated with 0.001, 0.01, and 0.1 μg/μl trypsin (Sigma) for 90 s at 20 °C. The reaction was stopped by adding excess soybean trypsin inhibitor (Roche Applied Science) and macroglobulin (Roche Applied Science). The membranes were pelleted and washed in 10 mm Tricine-KOH, pH 8.5, in the presence of both trypsin inhibitors. Proteolysis experiments were also performed with thermolysin (Calbiochem) and endoproteinase Glu-C (Roche Applied Science). In the proteolysis experiments with thermolysin, IEV were resuspended in 10 μl of 25 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.6, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm CaCl2 and treated with 0.001, 0.01, and 0.1 μg/μl thermolysin at 20 °C. After 2 min, the reaction was stopped by the addition of 10 mm EDTA. In a parallel experiment, IEV were resuspended in 10 μl of 50 mm NH4HCO3, pH 7.9, buffer and incubated with 0.01, 0.1, 1, and 4 μg of endoproteinase Glu-C at 20 °C. After 10 min, excess macroglobulin was added. The pelleted membranes were washed in buffer in the presence of macroglobulin. The recovered membranes were then solubilized in Laemmli buffer with 4 m urea and subjected to SDS-PAGE (8–14%) and immunoblotting using polyclonal antibody against Tic110. Peptide Fingerprint Mapping by Mass Spectrometry (MS)—The processed bands of Tic110 after trypsin digestion were sliced from SDS-PAGE and subjected to in-gel trypsin digestion. The protein extracted from the gel was analyzed by a combination of matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight and liquid chromatography/MS/MS analyses in the Protein Analysis Unit at the Adolf-Butenandt-Institute (Ludwig-Maximilians-Universität, Munich, Germany). To exclude degradation by endogenous proteases during sample preparation, the samples without trypsin were also analyzed by MS. The rough localization of cleavage sites for some of the proteolytic fragments after trypsin digestion of IEV proceeded as follows. First, the MASCOT program (20Perkins D.N. Pappin D.J.C. Creasy D.M. Cottrell J.S. Electrophoresis.. 1999; 20: 3551-3567Google Scholar) (mass tolerance = 20; missed cleavage sites = 0 or 1) was used to analyze the mass spectrometry data and identify fragments in the Tic110 sequence from pea. Then a region of Tic110 was assigned to each fragment, and the molecular weight of the fragment was compared with the molecular mass obtained in the SDS-PAGE. Considering the secondary structure prediction and assuming that the proteolysis reaction would preferentially occur in residues that do not belong to secondary structure elements (21Fontana A. de Laureto P.P. Spolaore B. Frare E. Picotti P. Zambonin M. Acta Biochim. Pol... 2004; 51: 299-321Google Scholar), a likely cleavage site is proposed. For some of the fragments, the N-terminal or C-terminal amino acid was detected, thus allowing a more precise estimation. Pegylation Assays—IEV were treated with 10 mm metoxypolyethylenglycol-maleimide (5,000 Da) (PEG-MAL; Laysan) in a buffer containing 0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, 1 mm EDTA, for 0, 5, 10, and 20 min, at 4 °C in the dark. The pegylation reaction was stopped by adding Laemmli buffer in the presence of 100 mm DTT. NuPAGE BisTris gels (7.5%) were employed using a Mops running buffer. The protein was detected by immunoblotting. CD Spectroscopy—The secondary structure of psTic110ΔN was analyzed by far-UV CD spectroscopy. The protein was dialyzed against 20 mm potassium phosphate, pH 8.0, and the protein concentration was adjusted to 3 μm. The CD spectrum was measured at 10 °C using a J-780 spectropolarimeter with a 1-mm optical path length cell over a wavelength range from 185 to 260 nm. The CD spectrum represents the average of four accumulations at a scanning speed of 20 nm/min and 1 nm spectral bandwidth. Protein concentration was estimated by the extinction coefficient at 280 nm in 6 m guanidine hydrochloride under reducing conditions, using the molar absorption coefficient calculated from the ExPASy server (available on the World Wide Web). The quantification of the secondary structure elements was estimated with the SELCON3 (22Sreerama N. Woody R.W. Anal. Biochem... 2000; 287: 252-260Google Scholar), CDSSTR (23Johnson W.C.

Lipman D.J. Nucleic Acids Res... 1997; 25: 3389-3402Google Scholar) was performed, using psTic110 as input, to retrieve all known sequences belonging to the Tic110 family. The multiple sequence alignment of the Tic110 family was performed by TCoffee (27Notredame C. Higgins D.G. Heringa J. J. Mol. Biol... 2000; 302: 205-217Google Scholar) and visually inspected. Internal repetition motifs, disorder regions, and hydropathy plots were predicted from the sequences by the MEME (28Bailey T.L. Williams N. Misleh C. Li W.W.

Proteins.. 2008; 70: 611-625Google Scholar) threading programs were employed in an attempt to assign a fold to Tic110. Influence of Oxidizing/Reducing Conditions in Tic110—psTic110ΔN was incubated with 50 μm CuCl2 or 10 mm DTT at 20 °C. After 1 h, the protein was trichloroacetic acid-precipitated (5% final concentration), and the pellet was washed with acetone and dissolved in a freshly prepared buffer containing 10 mm 4-acetamido-4′-maleimidylstilbene-2,2′-disulfonic acid (AMS; Invitrogen), 2 mm EDTA, 0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.0. Proteins were separated by nonreducing SDS-PAGE (8.5%) and Coomassie-stained. To check the reversibility of the redox reaction, a stock of psTic110ΔN (2 μm, soluble or reconstituted into liposomes) was oxidized with 50 μm CuCl2, dialyzed to remove the oxidant, and incubated with several concentrations of DTT (0.05–10 mm) or Trx (1 μm) from E. coli (Sigma) in the presence of either DTT (0.05, 0.5 mm) or NADPH Trx reductase (0.5 μm)/NADPH (2.5 mm). The capability of stromal f and m Trxs (1 μm) to reduce Tic110 was assayed in the presence of 0.5 mm DTT. Redox State of Tic110 in Darkness—The redox state of native Tic110 was analyzed in freshly prepared chloroplasts isolated in the dark. Chloroplasts were either untreated or treated with 50 μm CuCl2 or 2 mm Tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine (TCEP; Sigma) at 20 °C. After 30 min of incubation and solubilization (1% SDS), 10 mm AMS was added. The solubilized chloroplasts were subjected to SDS-PAGE (8.5%), and Tic110 was visualized by immunodecoration. Purification of Recombinant psTic110ΔN from Pea—psTic110ΔN (residues 96–959 from pea sequence; Fig. 1A), which lacks the two predicted transmembrane helices at the N terminus, was cloned into pET21d vector. The affinity purification of psTic110ΔN with a His-Trap column consistently resulted in three species of apparent molecular mass of about 100, 60, and 20 kDa (Fig. 1B, lane a). Immunoblotting with monoclonal anti-His tag antibodies showed that each of the three proteins contained the tag (data not shown). Edman degradation was therefore carried out to determine the N-terminal sequence of each protein. The first fragment obviously corresponded to the first residues of the psTic110ΔN plasmid; the second and the third obtained the N-terminal sequences, MADSKA and MKQIR, respectively, which correspond to internal fragments of the Tic110 protein. A closer look at the DNA sequence revealed the presence of two likely ribosome binding sites (RBS) (GGGGAG and GGGAAG) near a methionine residue (Met433 and Met788, respectively; Fig. 1A). Each binding site may turn into a “new” Tic110 translation initiation sites when overexpressed in E. coli. These two fragments are designated M2-psTic110ΔN (60 kDa) and M3-psTic110ΔN (20 kDa), respectively. The three proteins, including psTic110ΔN (99 kDa), could be adequately separated by size exclusion chromatography (SEC) (Fig. 1B, lane b). For some experiments, we took advantage of the second and third truncated forms of Tic110 from pea. The full-length protein (psTic110) was purified from inclusion bodies by His tag affinity column and refolded by dilution. The protein was further purified by SEC (Fig. 2B).FIGURE 2Tic110 association with detergents and incorporation into liposomes. A, Superdex 200 SEC profile of psTic110ΔN in the absence or presence of detergent (0.03% DDM). The three peaks correspond to the three truncated versions of psTic110ΔN, namely M1, M2, and M3. The profile was assayed both in the presence and absence of detergent. A shift in the elution volume of M1 and M2, toward higher molecular weight species in the presence of detergent suggests that both M1 and M2 bind detergent molecules. Reload of M1 and M2 alone in the size exclusion column does not change the elution volume, indicating that the dimer is stable in solution. The arrows indicate the retention volumes of soluble mass standard proteins; B, comparison of the SEC profiles of psTic110ΔN and psTic110 in the presence of 0.03% DDM. In the presence of detergent, both proteins show similar hydrodynamic properties, suggesting a similar overall conformation. C, flotation experiments of psTic110ΔN and M2- and M3-psTic110ΔN in liposome-free form or in proteoliposomes. Purified psTic110ΔN was incubated with liposomes, and its insertion was assayed by flotation analyses in a discontinuous sucrose gradient (1.6-0.1 m sucrose). Liposome-free psTic110ΔN and M2-psTic110ΔN protein is recovered at the bottom of the gradient (1.6 m), whereas the protein after incubation with liposomes floats at 0.4 m sucrose. However, M3-psTic110ΔN is not incorporated into the liposomes and remains at the bottom even after the incubation with liposomes; D, washing of psTic110ΔN proteoliposomes. After their preparation, psTic110ΔN proteoliposomes were washed with an increase in ionic strength (1 m Mops/Tris, pH 7.0), pH 11 (10 mm sodium carbonate), and urea (6 m), and the proteoliposomes were subjected to a flotation assay. In all cases, psTic110ΔN floats at 0.4 m sucrose, indicating that the incorporation of the protein is not due to nonspecific aggregation on the surface of the lipids. T, top; B, bottom. The sucrose concentration of each analyzed sample is indicated at the bottom of the figure.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) psTic110ΔN Behaves as a Dimer in Solution—Blue Native-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (Fig. 1C) and SEC-SLS (data not shown) clearly show that psTic110ΔN is actually a dimer (195 kDa), although the retention volume of psTic110ΔN in SEC corresponds to a globular protein of 400 kDa (Fig. 2A). The dimer is in equilibrium with minor amounts of tetramer. These differences are probably due to the fact that Tic110 is an elongated, nonglobular dimer, with a Stokes radius similar to that of a 400-kDa globular protein. Reinjection of the purified psTic110ΔN dimer onto the size exclusion column gave a single peak at the same elution volume, thus indicating that the dimer is stable at concentrations between 0.1 and 1.5 mg/ml. Higher concentrations were not yet tested. Attempts to create monomeric species of psTic110ΔN, changing conditions such as ionic strength (0–1 m NaCl), adding detergents (0.01–1% DDM) or pH (6.5–8), failed, suggesting that monomer formation is unstable in solution. SEC in combination with nonreducing SDS-PAGE showed that intermolecular disulfide bridges are not implicated in dimer formation. Thus, neither the retention volume nor the peak area changed in the presence of 10 mm DTT, and dimers were not visible in nonreducing SDS-PAGE in either the IEV or psTic110ΔN preparation (Fig. 1D, lanes a and b, respectively). Nevertheless, SDS-PAGE revealed monomer bands, confirming their presence under denaturing conditions. psTic110ΔN Binds Detergents and Liposomes—The capability of psTic110ΔN to bind detergents and phospholipid vesicles was assessed, respectively, by SEC and flotation experiments. Interestingly, SEC revealed that, unlike M3-psTic110ΔN, the retention volumes for psTic110ΔN and M2-psTic110ΔN downshifted significantly in the presence of detergent (0.03–1% DDM) (Fig. 2A). The shift in retention volume of psTic110ΔN and M2-psTic110ΔN approximate the running behavior of the full-length Tic110 (Tic110), indicating that they share similar hydrodynamic properties and, therefore, a similar conformation (Fig. 2B). Given that the presence of DDM did not affect the retention volume of the soluble proteins ferritin (440 kDa) and catalase (232 kDa) (data not shown), the lower retention volumes for psTic110ΔN and M2-psTic110ΔN suggest an association of the Tic110 proteins with the detergent. In another experiment, the isolated protein was incubated with liposomes in an attempt to produce functional proteoliposomes of psTic110ΔN, as previously reported (13Heins L. Mehrle A. Hemmler R. Wagner R. Kuchler M. Hormann F. Sveshnikov D. Soll J. EMBO J.. 2002; 21: 2616-2625Google Scholar). The insertion of the protein into the liposomes was assayed by flotation in a sucrose concentration gradient. In the absence of liposomes, psTic110ΔN stayed at the bottom of the sucrose gradient, whereas in the presence of phospholipids, the protein floated to the middle of the gradient (Fig. 2C). This result shows that psTic110ΔN reduces its density by binding to liposomes. The same experiment was also performed with the truncated versions of psTic110ΔN from pea (see above). M2-psTic110ΔN was able to bind to liposomes, like psTic110ΔN, whereas M3-psTic110ΔN, which stayed at the bottom of the gradient both in the presence or absence of liposomes, has no capability to bind to liposomes (Fig. 2C). To confirm that the interaction of psTic110ΔN with the liposomes did not involve nonspecific aggregation on the lipid surface, the proteoliposomes were washed with 6 m urea, 0.01 m sodium carbonate (pH 11), or higher ionic strength (1 m Mops/Tris, pH 7.0) for 30 min at 20 °C. Subsequently, the treated liposomes were subjected to flotation (Fig. 2D). The results demonstrate that psTic110ΔN is not simply attached"
https://openalex.org/W2011550644,"Untreated cystathionine beta-synthase (CBS) deficiency in humans is characterized by extremely elevated plasma total homocysteine (tHcy>200 microM), with thrombosis as the major cause of morbidity. Treatment with vitamins and diet leads to a dramatic reduction in thrombotic events, even though patients often still have severe elevations in tHcy (>80 microM). To understand the difference between extreme and severe hyperhomocysteinemia, we have examined two mouse models of CBS deficiency: Tg-hCBS Cbs(-/-) mice, with a mean serum tHcy of 169 microM, and Tg-I278T Cbs(-/-) mice, with a mean tHcy of 296 microM. Only Tg-I278T Cbs(-/-) animals exhibited strong biological phenotypes, including facial alopecia, osteoporosis, endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress in the liver and kidney, and a 20% reduction in mean survival time. Metabolic profiling of serum and liver reveals that Tg-I278T Cbs(-/-) mice have significantly elevated levels of free oxidized homocysteine but not protein-bound homocysteine in serum and elevation of all forms of homocysteine and S-adenosylhomocysteine in the liver compared to Tg-hCBS Cbs(-/-) mice. RNA profiling of livers indicate that Tg-I278T Cbs(-/-) and Tg-hCBS Cbs(-/-) mice have unique gene signatures, with minimal overlap. Our results indicate that there is a clear pathogenic threshold effect for tHcy and bring into question the idea that mild elevations in tHcy are directly pathogenic."

https://openalex.org/W2064081671,"Background Endoplasmic reticulum aminopeptidase 1 (ERAP1) trims N-terminally extended antigenic peptide precursors down to mature antigenic peptides for presentation by major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I molecules. ERAP1 has unique properties for an aminopeptidase being able to trim peptides in vitro based on their length and the nature of their C-termini. Methodology/Principal Findings In an effort to better understand the molecular mechanism that ERAP1 uses to trim peptides, we systematically analyzed the enzyme's substrate preferences using collections of peptide substrates. We discovered strong internal sequence preferences of peptide N-terminus trimming by ERAP1. Preferences were only found for positively charged or hydrophobic residues resulting to trimming rate changes by up to 100 fold for single residue substitutions and more than 40,000 fold for multiple residue substitutions for peptides with identical N-termini. Molecular modelling of ERAP1 revealed a large internal cavity that carries a strong negative electrostatic potential and is large enough to accommodate peptides adjacent to the enzyme's active site. This model can readily account for the strong preference for positively charged side chains. Conclusions/Significance To our knowledge no other aminopeptidase has been described to have such strong preferences for internal residues so distal to the N-terminus. Overall, our findings indicate that the internal sequence of the peptide can affect its trimming by ERAP1 as much as the peptide's length and C-terminus. We therefore propose that ERAP1 recognizes the full length of its peptide-substrate and not just the N- and C- termini. It is possible that ERAP1 trimming preferences influence the rate of generation and the composition of antigenic peptides in vivo."

Cox M.M. J. Mol. Biol... 1988; 203: 479-493Google Scholar). Filament nucleation occurs first and involves binding of a few (probably 4-5 (10Galletto R. Amitani I. Baskin R.J. Kowalczykowski S.C. Nature.. 2006; 443: 875-878Google Scholar)) RecA protomers to DNA. Nucleation is rate-limiting and is followed by rapid filament extension in the 5′ to 3′ direction along the DNA (11Register III, J.C. Griffith J. J. Biol. Chem... 1985; 260: 12308-12312Google Scholar, 12Shan Q. Bork J.M. Webb B.L. Inman R.B. Cox M.M. J. Mol. Biol... 1997; 265: 519-540Google Scholar, 13Shan Q. Cox M.M. J. Mol.

RecA filament disassembly requires ATP hydrolysis and also occurs in the 5′ to 3′ direction along ssDNA (14Bork J.M. Cox M.M. Inman R.B. J. Biol. Chem... 2001; 276: 45740-45743Google Scholar). Recombinase function is highly regulated in all cells, and the regulation occurs at many levels. The LexA repressor protein controls expression of the recA gene (15Defais M. Devoret R. Encyclopedia of Life Sciences.1st Ed. Wiley Publishers, London2000Google Scholar, 16Walker G.C. Smith B.T. Sutton M.D. Storz G. HenggeAronis R. Bacterial Stress Responses.

Finally, E. coli possesses many additional proteins that function as recombination regulators, with RecA as their target (20Kuzminov A. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev... 1999; 63: 751-813Google Scholar, 21Beernik H.T.H. Morrical S.W. Trends Biochem. Sci... 1999; 24: 385-389Google Scholar, 22Cox M.M. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol.

Proteins that facilitate the formation of the filaments of RecA-class recombinases are called recombination mediator proteins (21Beernik H.T.H. Morrical S.W. Trends Biochem.

During the extension phase of RecA filament formation, SSB protein has a positive effect by removing DNA secondary structure that would otherwise limit filament extension (34Kowalczykowski S.C. Clow J. Somani R. Varghese A. J. Mol. Biol... 1987; 193: 81-95Google Scholar). However, when SSB is pre-bound to ssDNA, it creates a significant kinetic barrier to RecA nucleation (31Umezu K. Kolodner R.D. J. Biol. Chem... 1994; 269: 30005-30013Google Scholar, 35Umezu K. Chi N.W. Kolodner R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A... 1993; 90: 3875-3879Google Scholar). Overcoming this barrier is the primary function of the recombination mediator protein proteins (20Kuzminov A. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev... 1999; 63: 751-813Google Scholar, 22Cox M.M. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol... 2007; 42: 41-63Google Scholar, 31Umezu K. Kolodner R.D. J. Biol. Chem... 1994; 269: 30005-30013Google Scholar, 35Umezu K. Chi N.W. Kolodner R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

J. Bacteriol... 1985; 163: 1060-1066Google Scholar)), and RecR (22 kDa (38Mahdi A.A. Lloyd R.G. Nucleic Acids Res... 1989; 17: 6781-6794Google Scholar, 39Mahdi A.A. Lloyd R.G. Mol. Gen. Genet... 1989; 216: 503-510Google Scholar)) proteins were discovered independently. The RecF protein exhibits extensive structural similarity with the head domain of the eukaryotic Rad50 protein but lacks the long coiled-coil domain of Rad50 (40Koroleva O. Makharashvili N. Courcelle C.T. Courcelle J. Korolev S. EMBO J.. 2007; 26: 867-877Google Scholar). RecF belongs to the ATP binding cassette (ABC) ATPase family of proteins. The protein binds to DNA, with increased affinity for dsDNA (31Umezu K. Kolodner R.D. J. Biol. Chem... 1994; 269: 30005-30013Google Scholar, 41Webb B.L. Cox M.M. Inman R.B. J. Biol.

Nucleic Acids Res... 2008; 36: 94-109Google Scholar). ATP binding triggers RecF dimerization (40Koroleva O. Makharashvili N. Courcelle C.T. Courcelle J. Korolev S. EMBO J.. 2007; 26: 867-877Google Scholar), and ATP hydrolysis triggers dissociation from DNA (44Webb B.L. Cox M.M. Inman R.B. J. Biol. Chem... 1999; 274: 15367-15374Google Scholar). The RecO protein contains an oligonucleotide binding fold in its N-terminal domain and binds both ssDNA and dsDNA (45Leiros I. Timmins J. Hall D.R. McSweeney S. EMBO J.. 2005; 24: 906-918Google Scholar, 46Luisi-DeLuca C. Kolodner R. J. Mol. Biol... 1994; 236: 124-138Google Scholar). RecO promotes the annealing of complementary oligonucleotides and can also catalyze invasion of duplex DNA by a complementary ssDNA (46Luisi-DeLuca C. Kolodner R. J. Mol. Biol... 1994; 236: 124-138Google Scholar, 47Kantake N. Madiraju M. Sugiyama T. Kowalczykowski S.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A... 2002; 99: 15327-15332Google Scholar). The E. coli RecR protein has no known intrinsic enzymatic or DNA binding activities, although the RecR homologs in Deinococcus radiodurans and Bacillus subtilis both bind to DNA (48Alonso J.C. Stiege A.C. Dobrinski B. Lurz R. J. Biol. Chem... 1993; 268: 1424-1429Google Scholar, 49Lee B.I. Kim K.H. Park S.J. Eom S.H. Song H.K. Suh S.W. EMBO J.. 2004; 23: 2029-2038Google Scholar). E. coli RecR protein binds to both RecF and RecO proteins in vitro (31Umezu K. Kolodner R.D. J. Biol. Chem... 1994; 269: 30005-30013Google Scholar, 41Webb B.L. Cox M.M. Inman R.B. J. Biol.

Nucleic Acids Res... 2008; 36: 94-109Google Scholar). There is an apparent competition between RecF and RecO for RecR binding that may involve an interaction of both RecF and RecO with the C-terminal TOPRIM domain of RecR (50Bork J.M. Cox M.M. Inman R.B. EMBO J.. 2001; 20: 7313-7322Google Scholar, 51Honda M. Inoue J. Yoshimasu M. Ito Y. Shibata T. Mikawa T. J. Biol. Chem... 2006; 281: 18549-18559Google Scholar). RecR increases the apparent affinity of both RecO and RecF for DNA (31Umezu K. Kolodner R.D. J. Biol. Chem... 1994; 269: 30005-30013Google Scholar, 41Webb B.L. Cox M.M. Inman R.B. J. Biol.

Decades of genetic and physiological studies have firmly implicated the E. coli RecF, RecO, and RecR proteins as facilitators of the formation of RecA filaments on SSB-coated ssDNA (5Clark A.J.

However, in vitro experiments have not provided confirmation of the expected RecFOR complex. The RecO and RecR proteins appear necessary and sufficient for the nucleation of RecA on SSB-coated ssDNA (12Shan Q. Bork J.M. Webb B.L. Inman R.B. Cox M.M. J. Mol. Biol... 1997; 265: 519-540Google Scholar, 31Umezu K. Kolodner R.D. J. Biol. Chem... 1994; 269: 30005-30013Google Scholar). The RecF protein (functioning in complex with RecR) can act as a barrier to RecA filament extension on dsDNA (42Webb B.L. Cox M.M. Inman R.B. Cell.. 1997; 91: 347-356Google Scholar). RecF can also facilitate RecA filament extension on ssDNA by antagonizing the activity of the RecX inhibitor (30Lusetti S.L. Hobbs M.D. Stohl E.A. Chitteni-Pattu S. Inman R.B. Seifert H.S. Cox M.M. Mol. Cell.. 2006; 21: 41-50Google Scholar). However, the effect of RecF on RecA filament nucleation remains unclear. The addition of RecF protein has a neutral or inhibitory effect on RecOR function under most experimental conditions (12Shan Q. Bork J.M. Webb B.L. Inman R.B. Cox M.M. J. Mol. Biol... 1997; 265: 519-540Google Scholar, 30Lusetti S.L. Hobbs M.D. Stohl E.A. Chitteni-Pattu S. Inman R.B. Seifert H.S. Cox M.M. Mol. Cell.. 2006; 21: 41-50Google Scholar, 31Umezu K. Kolodner R.D.

Chem... 2007; 282: 11058-11067Google Scholar). A RecF enhancement in reactions involving gapped DNAs (single-strand circles with several short oligos annealed) provides an important exception to this trend (32Morimatsu K. Kowalczykowski S.C. Mol. Cell.. 2003; 11: 1337-1347Google Scholar). The RecO and RecR proteins function together (12Shan Q. Bork J.M. Webb B.L. Inman R.B. Cox M.M. J. Mol. Biol... 1997; 265: 519-540Google Scholar, 31Umezu K. Kolodner R.D. J. Biol. Chem... 1994; 269: 30005-30013Google Scholar, 32Morimatsu K. Kowalczykowski S.C. Mol. Cell.. 2003; 11: 1337-1347Google Scholar, 43Inoue J. Honda M. Ikawa S. Shibata T. Mikawa T. Nucleic Acids Res... 2008; 36: 94-109Google Scholar). The RecOR-facilitated nucleation of RecA filaments onto SSB-coated ssDNA (RecAOR nucleation) is limited by access of RecOR to ssDNA (61Hobbs M.D. Sakai A. Cox M.M. J. Biol. Chem... 2007; 282: 11058-11067Google Scholar). The rate of RecA loading by RecOR declines as SSB concentration increases, presumably due to the elimination of gaps of free ssDNA between bound SSB tetramers or to unproductive interactions between RecO and SSB that is not bound to DNA (61Hobbs M.D. Sakai A. Cox M.M. J. Biol. Chem... 2007; 282: 11058-11067Google Scholar). The overall pathway involves an interaction of RecO with the C terminus of SSB (61Hobbs M.D. Sakai A. Cox M.M. J. Biol. Chem... 2007; 282: 11058-11067Google Scholar). The enhancement of RecOR function by RecF when short oligos are annealed to the single-stranded DNA has one additional requirement; it occurs only when SSB is present in large excess relative to ssDNA binding sites (32Morimatsu K. Kowalczykowski S.C. Mol. Cell.. 2003; 11: 1337-1347Google Scholar). The excess SSB could affect the reaction by suppressing RecO function, and the effects of RecF in the published report provide a starting place for the current study. Enzymes and Reagents—The E. coli RecA (17Lusetti S.L. Wood E.A. Fleming C.D. Modica M.J. Korth J. Abbott L. Dwyer D.W. Roca A.I. Inman R.B. Cox M.M. J. Biol.

The concentration of each protein was determined by absorbance at 280 nm using their respective extinction coefficients: ϵ280 = 2.23 × 104m-1 cm-1 for RecA (61Hobbs M.D. Sakai A. Cox M.M. J. Biol. Chem... 2007; 282: 11058-11067Google Scholar), ϵ280 = 2.3 × 104m-1 cm-1 for RecO (47Kantake N. Madiraju M. Sugiyama T. Kowalczykowski S.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Biol... 1997; 265: 519-540Google Scholar), ϵ280 = 3.87 × 104m-1 cm-1for RecF (44Webb B.L. Cox M.M. Inman R.B. J. Biol.

DNA Substrates—Circular ssDNA from bacteriophage M13mp18 (7249 nucleotides) was prepared as described (63Neuendorf S.K. Cox M.M. J. Biol. Chem... 1986; 261: 8276-8282Google Scholar). DNA duplex for making gapped DNA with a 1320-bp duplex region was prepared by PCR using a DNA Engine PTC-200 Peltier thermal cycler. The primers used for the 1773-bp fragment were M13mp8-1741 (5′-CTGTGGAATGCTACAGGCG-3′) and M13mp8-3513 (5′-CGGCTGTCTTTCCTTATC-3′). The PCR product was digested by AlwNI. The cleaved DNA (1320-bp) was isolated from 1% agarose gel and purified by a Wizard SV Gel and PCR Clean-up System (Promega). RecA-promoted three-strand DNA exchange reactions were used to make the 1320-nucleotide-annealed M13mp18. These were carried out at 37 °C in a solution containing 25 mm Tris-OAc (80% cation (pH 7.5)), 1 mm DTT, 5% (w/v) glycerol, 3 mm potassium glutamate, 10 mm Mg(OAc)2, and an ATP regeneration system (20 units/ml pyruvate kinase and 5 mm phosphoenolpyruvate). The wild-type RecA protein was preincubated with M13mp18 circular ssDNA for 10 min, and then SSB protein (6 μm) and dATP (5 mm) were added. After another 10 min of incubation, 1320 bp linear double-strand DNA were added into the solution and incubated more than 3 h. The reaction mixture were stopped with a half-mixture volume of a solution containing 15% Ficoll, 0.25% bromphenol blue, 0.25% xylene cyanol, 72 mm EDTA, and 4% SDS. The samples were incubated more than 15 min at 37 °C and then subjected to electrophoresis in 0.8% agarose gels with TAE buffer (40 mm Tris-OAc, 1 mm EDTA). The product DNA band was isolated from the gel and purified by Wizard SV Gel and PCR Clean-up System (Promega). Oligonucleotides—gap1 (5′-GGTCATTTTTGCCGATGGCTTAGAGCTTAATT-3′), gap2 (5′-GACAGATGAACGGTGTACAGACCAGGCGCATAGGC-3′), gap3 (5′-CACCAATGAAACCATCGATAGCAGCACCGTAA-3′), and gap4 (AAATATCTTTAGGTGCACTAACAACTAATAGA-3′) are complementary to the M13mp18 viral ssDNA sequence. The gDNA1 and gDNA4 substrates were prepared by incubating a solution containing 50 mm NaCl, 41 μm M13mp18, and 41 μm concentrations of each required oligonucleotide (gap1 for gDNA1 and all 4 for gDNA4) at 70 °C followed by cooling to room temperature 1 h. The concentration of ssDNA and dsDNA was determined by absorbance at 260 nm using 36 and 50 μg ml-1A2601 respectively, as conversion factors. The conversion factors used to calculate the concentration of gapped DNA were based on the fractions of ssDNA and dsDNA in the molecules. All DNA concentrations are given in μm nucleotides. RecA-mediated ATP Hydrolysis Assay—A coupled spectrophotometric enzyme assay (64Lindsley J.E. Cox M.M. J. Biol. Chem... 1990; 265: 9043-9054Google Scholar, 65Morrical S.W. Lee J. Cox M.M. Biochemistry.. 1986; 25: 1482-1494Google Scholar) was used to measure the DNA-dependent ATPase activity of RecA protein. The regeneration of ATP from ADP and phosphoenolpyruvate driven by the oxidation of NADH can be followed by a decrease in absorbance of NADH at 380 nm. Although the absorbance maximum for NADH occurs at 340 nm, absorbance was measured at 380 nm to remain within the linear range of the spectrophotometer for the duration of the experiment. The cell path length and band pass were 0.5 cm and 2 nm, respectively. Concentrations of NADH were calculated using an extinction coefficient of ϵ280 = 1.21 mm-1 cm-1 at 380 nm. Rates of ssDNA-dependent ATP hydrolysis and lag times were measured at 37 °C in a reaction mixture (80 μl) containing 25 mm Tris-OAc (pH 7.5, 80% cation), 10 mm Mg(OAc)2, 5% (w/v) glycerol, 3 mm ATP, and 1 mm DTT, an ATP regeneration system (3 mm phosphoenolpyruvate, 10 units/ml pyruvate kinase), and a coupling system (3 mm NADH, 10 units/ml lactate dehydrogenase, and 3 mm potassium glutamate). The final pH after the addition of all reaction components was 7.6. Concentrations of DNA and proteins are reported in the legends to figures 1,3,4,5, and 6. When a protein was omitted from a reaction, the appropriate storage buffer was added in its place. The storage buffer for wild-type RecA includes 20 mm Tris-Cl (80% cation), 0.1 mm EDTA, 10% (w/v) glycerol, and 1 mm DTT. RecF, RecO, and RecR proteins were stored in 20 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.5), 0.1 mm EDTA, 100 mm NaCl, 60% (w/v) glycerol, and 1 mm DTT. The SSB SSBΔC8 protein was stored in 20 mm Tris-Cl (pH 8.3), 500 mm NaCl, 50% (w/v) glycerol, and 1 mm DTT.FIGURE 3Order of addition effects on the RecFOR-mediated loading of RecA onto ssDNA coated with SSBΔC8. Reactions contained 3 μm ssDNA, 4 μm RecA protein, 0.5 μm SSBΔC8, and 3 mm ATP. Where indicated, the RecF (0.2 μm), RecO (0.1 μm), and RecR (1 μm) proteins were added. A, RecF protein was incubated with ssDNA and ATP before SSBΔC8. After 10 min of incubation at 37 °C, the RecO and/or RecR proteins were added to some experiments as indicated.

The lag time corresponds to the time-intercept of a linear regression line fit to the steady state portion of data in ATP hydrolysis assay. Oligodeoxyribonucleotides for DNA Binding Assay and Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay—Synthetic oligodeoxynucleotides were den2 (5′-GTGCGCTCCGAGCTCAGCTACCGCGAGGCC), den7 (5′-GGCCTCGCGGTAGCTGAGCTCGGAGCGCACGATTCGCACTGCTGATGTTC*), den10 (5′-GAACATCAGCAGTGCGAATCGTGCGCTCCGAGCTCAGCTACCGCGAGGCC), den11 (5′-GAACATCAGCAGTGCGAATCGTGCGCTCCG), den16 (5′-CGGAGCGCACGATTCGCACTGCTGATGTTC*), den17 (5′-GAACATCAGCAGTGCGAATCGTGCGCTCCGAGCTCAGCTACCGCGAGGCC), and den28 (5′-GGC CTC GCG GTA GCT GAG CTC GGA GCG CAC*) (the asterisks denote the presence of a 3′-6-carboxyfluorescein fluorescent label). Equimolar oligode-oxynucleotides were annealed by heating to 95 °C for 2∼3 min and slowly cooled to room temperature, and 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin was added and cooled to 4 °C. The double-strand DNA substrate 50 or 30 bp was created by annealing den7/den10 or den2/den28, respectively. The 3′ overhang or 5′ overhang DNA substrates were created by annealing den16/17 or den7/11, respectively. DNA Binding Assays—The ratio of RecF and RecR was maintained at 1:2 in all experiments. Diluted proteins were mixed with fluorescence polarization buffer (20 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.6), 50 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 40% (w/v) glycerol, 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 1 mm DTT), 10 nm fluorescein-labeled DNA substrate, and 0.1 mm ATPγS in a total reaction volume of 100 μl. After incubation for 20 min at room temperature, fluorescence polarization was measured at 25 °C using Panvera Beacon 2000 fluorescence polarization system with 490-nm excitation and 535-nm emission wavelengths. Each reaction was performed in triplicate and plotted as the average fraction DNA bound. Error bars represent one S.D. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay—The RecF/RecR ratio was maintained at 1:2. RecFR was incubated with the fluorescent-labeled DNA substrates for 90 min at 30 °C. The reaction conditions were 20 nm DNA, 25 mm Tris-OAc (80% cation (pH 7.4), 5% (w/v) glycerol, 3 mm potassium glutamate, 10 mm Mg(OAc)2, 1 mm DTT, and 1 mm ATPγS. After 90 min, 20 μl of each reaction was added to 4 μl of loading buffer (20 mm Tris-OAc (80% cation (pH 7.5)), 18% (w/v) Ficoll), and reactions were loaded onto a native 6% polyacrylamide gel and subjected to electrophoresis in 90 mm Tris borate and 10 mm EDTA. Experimental Design—The purpose of this study was to further investigate the role of RecF protein and its relationship to RecO and RecR in the loading of RecA onto SSB-coated ssDNA. The RecA protein hydrolyzes ATP when bound to DNA, and the rate of ATP hydrolysis generally correlates well to the amount of RecA bound to the DNA. Effects on RecA loading can be seen in both the final steady state rate of ATP hydrolysis (linear phase, reflecting the total amounts of RecA protein loaded onto the DNA) and the lag time required before that steady state rate is achieved (61Hobbs M.D. Sakai A.

https://openalex.org/W2075954817,"Penicillin-binding protein 2 (PBP2) from N. gonorrhoeae is the major molecular target for β-lactam antibiotics used to treat gonococcal infections. PBP2 from penicillin-resistant strains of N. gonorrhoeae harbors an aspartate insertion after position 345 (Asp-345a) and 4-8 additional mutations, but how these alter the architecture of the protein is unknown. We have determined the crystal structure of PBP2 derived from the penicillin-susceptible strain FA19, which shows that the likely effect of Asp-345a is to alter a hydrogen-bonding network involving Asp-346 and the SXN triad at the active site. We have also solved the crystal structure of PBP2 derived from the penicillin-resistant strain FA6140 that contains four mutations near the C terminus of the protein. Although these mutations lower the second order rate of acylation for penicillin by 5-fold relative to wild type, comparison of the two structures shows only minor structural differences, with the positions of the conserved residues in the active site essentially the same in both. Kinetic analyses indicate that two mutations, P551S and F504L, are mainly responsible for the decrease in acylation rate. Melting curves show that the four mutations lower the thermal stability of the enzyme. Overall, these data suggest that the molecular mechanism underlying antibiotic resistance contributed by the four mutations is subtle and involves a small but measurable disordering of residues in the active site region that either restricts the binding of antibiotic or impedes conformational changes that are required for acylation by β-lactam antibiotics.

Neisseria gonorrhoeae, the causative agent of the sexually transmitted infection, gonorrhea, is an obligate human pathogen that primarily colonizes the urogenital tract. For nearly 40 years N. gonorrhoeae was treated with a single dose of penicillin, but in 1987 the prevalence of penicillin-resistant strains necessitated the use of alternative antibiotics (1Centers for Disease ControlMMWR Morb. Mortal Wkly. Rep. 2007; 56: 332-336PubMed Google Scholar), primarily fluoroquinolones and third-generation cephalosporins. The rapid emergence and dissemination of fluoroquinolone-resistant N. gonorrhoeae, however, leaves only third-generation cephalosporins (e.g. cefixime and ceftriaxone) as recommended agents (1Centers for Disease ControlMMWR Morb. Mortal Wkly. Rep. 2007; 56: 332-336PubMed Google Scholar). Even though these cephalosporins are still effective anti-gonococcal antibiotics, the increasing prevalence of strains with intermediate resistance to these agents suggests that full resistance is not far behind (2Ameyama S. Onodera S. Takahata M. Minami S. Maki N. Endo K. Goto H. Suzuki H. Oishi Y. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2002; 46: 3744-3749Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 3Wang S.A. Lee M.V.

These trends signal an urgent need to understand the molecular mechanisms of antibiotic resistance and to devise new treatment options for gonococcal infections. The molecular targets of β-lactam antibiotics are the penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs), 3The abbreviations used are: PBP, penicillin-binding protein; MIC, minimal inhibitory concentration; r.m.s.d., root mean square deviation; TPase, transpeptidase. a group of enzymes involved in the final stages of peptidoglycan synthesis in bacteria (6Ghuysen J.M. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1991; 45: 37-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar, 7Ghuysen J.M. Trends Microbiol. 1994; 2: 372-380Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 8Holtje J.V. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1998; 62: 181-203Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). PBPs are grouped into three main classes, A, B, and C. Class A and B PBPs are transpeptidases (TPases) that catalyze the formation of peptide cross-links between adjacent glycan strands of peptidoglycan, but are distinguished in that class A PBPs also contain an N-terminal transglycosylase domain that polymerizes glycan strands, whereas class B PBPs possess only TPase activity. Class C PBPs catalyze carboxypeptidase activity (and sometimes endopeptidase activity) in vitro and may function to modulate the degree of cross-linking in peptidoglycan by removing the terminal d-Ala of the peptide. Four PBPs have been identified in N. gonorrhoeae (9Barbour A.G. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1981; 19: 316-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 10Stefanova M.E. Tomberg J. Davies C. Nicholas R.A. Gutheil W.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 2004; 271: 23-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar): two high molecular mass transpeptidases, class A PBP1 and class B PBP2, and two low molecular mass class C PBPs, PBPs 3 and 4. Both PBP3 and PBP4, which catalyze carboxypeptidase and endopeptidase activity in vitro (10Stefanova M.E. Tomberg J. Davies C. Nicholas R.A. Gutheil W.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 2004; 271: 23-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 11Stefanova M.E. Tomberg J. Olesky M. Holtje J.V. Gutheil W.G. Nicholas R.A. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 14614-14625Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), can be deleted from N. gonorrhoeae with only minor effects on cell growth and morphology (11Stefanova M.E. Tomberg J. Olesky M. Holtje J.V. Gutheil W.G. Nicholas R.A. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 14614-14625Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), whereas PBPs 1 and 2 are essential for cell viability and are the lethal targets of β-lactam antibiotics (9Barbour A.G. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1981; 19: 316-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 12Ropp P.A. Nicholas R.A. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 2783-2787Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Because PBP2 is inhibited at 10-fold lower concentrations of penicillin than PBP1 in penicillin-susceptible strains, PBP2 is the primary killing target of penicillin at its minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) (9Barbour A.G. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1981; 19: 316-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Chromosomally mediated penicillin-resistant strains of N. gonorrhoeae arise through the stepwise acquisition of multiple resistance determinants via DNA uptake and homologous recombination (13Cannon J.G. Sparling P.F. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1984; 38: 111-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 14Faruki H. Sparling P.F. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1986; 30: 856-860Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). These resistance determinants include mutations of PBPs 1 and 2 that lower their susceptibility to β-lactam antibiotics (penA and ponA) (15Spratt B.G. Nature. 1988; 332: 173-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar, 16Ropp P.A. Hu M. Olesky M. Nicholas R.A. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2002; 46: 769-777Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar), mutations in porin IB that reduce entry of antibiotics into the cell (penB) (17Gill M.J. Simjee S. Al-Hattawi K.

Agents Chemother. 2002; 46: 2811-2820Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar), and increased expression of the MtrC-MtrD-MtrE efflux pump that expels antibiotics from the periplasm (mtrR) (19Hagman K.E. Pan W. Spratt B.G. Balthazar J.T. Judd R.C. Shafer W.M. Microbiology. 1995; 141: 611-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar, 20Veal W.L. Nicholas R.A. Shafer W.M. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 5619-5624Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Together, the mutations in high level penicillin-resistant strains (e.g. FA6140) increase the MIC of penicillin 400-1000-fold relative to a penicillin-susceptible strain (e.g. FA19). The first step in the development of chromosomally mediated penicillin resistance in N. gonorrhoeae is acquisition of penA, which encodes altered forms of PBP2 (15Spratt B.G. Nature. 1988; 332: 173-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar, 21Sparling P.F. Sarubbi Jr., F.A. Blackman E. J. Bacteriol. 1975; 124: 740-749Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although by itself the penA determinant accounts for a relatively small contribution to penicillin resistance in N. gonorrhoeae, this first step is requisite for the development of high level resistance. Variants of PBP2 from penicillin-resistant strains very often contain an aspartic acid insertion between amino acids 345 and 346 (termed Asp-345a or D-345a) along with 4-8 substitutions near the C terminus of the protein (22Dowson C.G. Jephcott A.E. Gough K.R. Spratt B.G. Mol. Microbiol. 1989; 3: 35-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 23Brannigan J.A. Tirodimos I.A. Zhang Q.Y. Dowson C.G. Spratt B.G. Mol. Microbiol. 1990; 4: 913-919Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Because PBP2 is an essential enzyme, these mutations must remodel the active site so as to lower the rate of acylation by penicillin without markedly affecting its ability to function as a TPase. This is an intriguing phenomenon because β-lactam antibiotics are structural mimics of the peptide substrate (24Tipper D.J. Strominger J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1965; 54: 1133-1141Crossref PubMed Scopus (637) Google Scholar) and react with the same serine nucleophile at the active site of the enzyme (25Yocum R.R. Waxman D.J. Rasmussen J.R. Strominger J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 2730-2734Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). How PBPs achieve this distinction at the molecular level remains a subject of considerable interest (26Mouz N. Gordon E. Di Guilmi A.M. Petit I. Petillot Y. Dupont Y. Hakenbeck R. Vernet T.

Biol. 2002; 9: 870-876PubMed Google Scholar) have been used to propose mechanisms of penicillin resistance in their respective organisms. However, mechanistic interpretation has been hampered in PBP2x and PBP1a by the large number of mutations between the susceptible and resistant forms (e.g. PBP2x from strain Sp328 contains 83 mutations (27Dessen A. Mouz N. Gordon E. Hopkins J. Dideberg O. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 45106-45112Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar)) and in PBP2a by the lack of a penicillin-susceptible counterpart. PBP2 from N. gonorrhoeae is a more amenable system to understand the molecular basis for penicillin resistance because only a small number of mutations are responsible for conferring antibiotic resistance. Here, we report the crystal structure of a soluble form of PBP2 derived from a penicillin-susceptible strain (FA19) (35Maness M.J. Sparling P.F. J. Infect. Dis. 1973; 128: 321-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) and of a construct derived from a penicillin-resistant strain (FA6140) (14Faruki H. Sparling P.F. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1986; 30: 856-860Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) of N. gonorrhoeae that contains four mutations near the C terminus of the protein that are associated with penicillin resistance. Even though the kinetic differences between these proteins are significant, there is a surprising lack of structural differences between the two proteins, suggesting a very subtle molecular mechanism of antibiotic resistance. Although a mutant protein containing Asp-345a could not be crystallized, the crystal structure of the native protein suggests that such an insertion will disrupt interactions involving the SXN motif of the enzyme. Protein Expression and Purification—The sequence encoding the periplasmic domain of PBP2 (residues 44-581) and a four-amino acid spacer (Gly-Ser-Gly-Gly) was fused in-frame to the C-terminal end of maltose-binding protein in the vector pMAL-C2KV/H6 (11Stefanova M.E. Tomberg J. Olesky M. Holtje J.V. Gutheil W.G. Nicholas R.A. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 14614-14625Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). pMAL-C2KV/H6 is similar to pMAL-C2 (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA) except that it contains the kanamycin resistance gene in place of the β-lactamase gene, a tobacco etch virus protease cleavage site at the junction of the two proteins, and six histidine residues between the second and third amino acids of maltose-binding protein. The maltose-binding protein-PBP2 fusion protein was purified from 2 liters of Escherichia coli GW6011 (MC4100 lon-146::Tn10) cells harboring the expression plasmid after induction of the cells with 0.3 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactoside for 2 h at 18 °C. Cells were harvested by centrifugation, resuspended in 40 ml of buffer A (20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 500 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol) containing 2 mm EDTA and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and lysed with an Emulsiflex-C5 disrupter (Avestin, Ottawa, Canada). After centrifugation at 100,000 × g to remove membranes and particulates, ammonium sulfate was added to 40% saturation, and precipitated proteins were isolated by centrifugation at 15,000 × g. The protein pellet was resuspended in buffer A, filtered, and loaded onto a Ni2+-chelating affinity column (GE Healthcare). The column was washed sequentially with 20 column volumes of buffer A and 5 column volumes of buffer A with 15 mm imidazole, and the fusion protein was eluted with a gradient of 15-300 mm imidazole in buffer A. The purified fusion protein was dialyzed at 4 °C for 3 h against buffer A to remove imidazole and simultaneously cleaved with His6-tagged tobacco etch virus protease (50:1 weight ratio). PBP2 was isolated from the digest by a second passage over Ni2+-chelating affinity column. Minor contaminants eluted in the flow-through, whereas PBP2 (>95% purity) eluted in the 15 mm imidazole wash. The purified protein was concentrated to 5-7 mg/ml in buffer A (typical yields were 30 mg protein/2 liters of culture). Selenomethionine-substituted PBP2 was prepared by expressing the protein in B834(DE3) methionine auxotroph cells (Novagen, San Diego, CA) and growing in M9 minimal media containing all amino acids except that selenomethionine was used in place of methionine. This protein was purified in the same way as for PBP2 except that 4 mm β-mercaptoethanol was added to all buffers. PBP2 from FA6140 was amplified from genomic DNA with the same gene-specific primers as for wild-type penA and cloned into pMAL-C2KVH6. To create PBP2-6140CT and PBP2-Asp-345a, a silent KpnI site was introduced at codons 366 and 367 in both wild type PBP2 and PBP2-6140 by the QuikChange method (Stratagene, Carlsbad, CA), and the final constructs were created by fragment exchange. All other mutants were created in wild-type PBP2 by the QuikChange method. Purification of these mutant PBP2 variants was accomplished using the same protocol described above for wild-type PBP2. Kinetic Analysis of PBP2 Variants—The kinetic scheme for the interaction of a PBP with a β-lactam antibiotic is, where E·S is the non-covalent Michaelis complex, E-S is the covalent acyl-enzyme complex, and P is the released product. The constant k2/KS, in which KS = (k-1 + k2)/k1 describes the initial rate of formation of covalent β-lactam antibiotic-target conjugates (E-S) at low (subsaturating) concentrations of β-lactam antibiotics (36Frere J.M. Nguyen-Disteche M. Coyette J. Joris B. Page M.I. The Chemistry of β-lactams. Chapman & Hall, Glasgow1992: 148-196Google Scholar). The deacylation rate of the penicilloyl-PBP2 complex is very slow and can be ignored. The second order k2/KS rate constants for acylation of PBP2 variants were determined from time courses of formation of acyl-enzyme complexes as described previously (11Stefanova M.E. Tomberg J. Olesky M. Holtje J.V. Gutheil W.G. Nicholas R.A. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 14614-14625Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). In all cases, [14C]penicillin G was present in at least a 10-fold molar excess over PBP2. Crystallization—Crystals of PBP2 and PBP2-6140CT were obtained by vapor diffusion over wells containing 2.0-2.4 m ammonium sulfate buffered with 100 mm Tris, pH 8.0-8.5. These rectangular-shaped prisms of approximate dimensions 0.5 × 0.1 × 0.3 mm grew after 2-3 weeks of incubation at 21 °C. A cryo-protecting solution was prepared by adding glycerol to the well solution in 2% increments up to a final concentration of 34%. Diffraction analysis revealed that the crystals belong to space group P212121 with cell dimensions a = 57.4, b = 138.6, and c = 228.0 Å. There are two molecules in the asymmetric unit, giving an estimated solvent content of 65% (37Matthews B. J. Mol. Biol. 1968; 33: 491-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (7922) Google Scholar). Selenomethionine-containing crystals were prepared in the same manner. Data Collection and Phasing—Data from selenomethionine-containing crystals were collected at 100 K at beamline 9.2 of the Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Laboratory (Stanford, CA) on a Quantum 4 charge-coupled device detector using the BLU-ICE environment (38McPhillips T.M. McPhillips S.E.H.J.C. Cohen A.E. Deacon A.M. Ellis P.J. Garman E. Gonzalez A. Sauter N.K. Phizackerley R.P. Soltis S.M. Kuhn P. J. Synchrotron Radiat. 2002; 9: 401-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (948) Google Scholar). Data at three wavelengths were collected, corresponding to the peak, inflection, and a high energy remote, around the absorption edge of selenium using inverse beam geometry in two 90° segments. These data were processed at a resolution of 2.8 Å using DENZO and SCALEPACK (39Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38572) Google Scholar) (supplemental Table 1). The structure was solved by SOLVE (40Terwilliger T. Berendzen J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 1999; 55: 849-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (3220) Google Scholar) and RESOLVE (41Terwilliger T. Acta Crystallogr. D. 2000; 56: 965-972Crossref PubMed Scopus (1634) Google Scholar, 42Terwilliger T.C. Acta Cryst. D. 2002; 58: 1937-1940Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar) using only the first 90° of the peak and remote data sets. Inclusion of the second wedge of these data or of the inflection data set lowered the quality of electron density maps, probably due to radiation damage. Selenomethionine-substituted crystals of PBP2 diffracted slightly better than native crystals, and therefore these crystals were also used to collect a high resolution data set for refinement of the structure. These data were processed using MOSFLM (43Leslie, A. G. W. (1992) Joint CCP4 + ESF-EAMCB Newsletter on Protein Crystallography No. 26Google Scholar) and SCALA (44CCP4Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19769) Google Scholar) (Table 1). Data from crystals of PBP2-6140CT were collected at the SER-CAT ID22 beamline of the Advanced Photon Source on a Mar 300 charge-coupled device detector and processed using HKL2000 (39Otwinowski Z.

Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13011) Google Scholar) and used to construct an initial model. This was refined by iterative cycles of automated refinement and manual revisions using O. Initial refinements used XPLOR (46Brünger A.T. X-PLOR, Version 3.1, A System for X-ray Crystallography and NMR. Yale University, New Haven, CT1992Google Scholar) but later rounds used REFMAC (47Murshudov G.N. Vagin A.A. Dodson E.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 1997; 53: 240-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (13870) Google Scholar). Non-crystallographic symmetry restraints were not used during the refinement. 5% of reflections were set aside for the calculation of Rfree. Solvent molecules were added using ARP/wARP (48Lamzin V.S. Wilson K.S. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 1993; 49: 129-147Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In later rounds TLS parameters were refined, where each domain of the protein was defined as a separate TLS group. The stereochemistry of the model was monitored by PROCHECK (49Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar). The structure of PBP2-6140CT was refined by the same protocol. Refinement statistics of both models are shown in Table 1. There are two molecules in the asymmetric unit of PBP2, and all common main chain atoms can be superimposed with a root mean square deviation (r.m.s.d.) of 0.70 Å (the same value is 0.75 Å for PBP2-6140CT). The protein is numbered according to the sequence of the protein in vivo. Hence, the first 44 residues, corresponding to the N-terminal tail and transmembrane domains, are not present in the construct. Residues that were not visible in the electron density were excluded from the model. In both molecules of the asymmetric unit, ∼20 residues are absent at the N terminus, such that molecule A starts at Asn-63 and molecule B at Ile-65. Three areas of disorder were evident: a large area of disorder comprising residues 93-163 in molecule A and 92-163 in molecule B, a smaller region comprising 502-512 in molecule A and 504-511 in molecule B, and residues 213-215 that are disordered in molecule B only. Finally, eight residues were excluded from the C terminus in both molecules of the asymmetric unit. The electron density shows clearly that Ser-465 of both molecules in the asymmetric is phosphorylated and, therefore, has been modeled accordingly. This site is on the surface of the transpeptidase domain at the N-terminal end of α10, on the opposite side of the molecule from the active site. This apparent modification is observed consistently in data sets collected from different crystals of PBP2 (both wild-type and mutant) and using proteins from different preparations. An example of omit |Fo|-|Fc| electron density for one of these (A465) is shown in supplemental Fig. 1. Because PBP2 was expressed in the cytoplasm of E. coli, this phosphorylation may not be physiologically relevant. Circular Dichroism—Each protein (PBP2, PBP2-6140, and PBP2-6140CT) was diluted to a concentration of 0.1 mg/ml in a buffer containing 10 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 250 mm NaCl, and 10% glycerol. The melting curves for each PBP2 construct were measured an AVIV Biomedical Inc. Model 400 circular dichroism spectrophotometer at 206 nm (corresponding to the minimum in a 260-195-nm wavelength scan). Data were recorded every degree over a temperature range of 25-75 °C. These measurements were repeated six times (with a new sample of protein each time) and then averaged. All spectra were corrected against a control spectrum collected from buffer only, and the mean residual ellipticity was calculated using AVIV software. The melting temperature (Tm) for each construct was calculated as the midpoint of the slope between the mean residual ellipticity values where the protein was folded and unfolded. Mass spectrometry was used to show that the differences observed in the melting curves were not due to different levels of phosphorylation in the three proteins (see the supplemental data). The crystal structure of a soluble form of PBP2 (residues 42-581) from a penicillin-susceptible strain of N. gonorrhoeae was solved at 2.4 Å by multiwavelength anomalous dispersion methods using selenomethionyl-substituted protein. PBP2 contains two domains, an N-terminal domain and a C-terminal TPase (or penicillin binding) domain that is common to all PBPs (Fig. 1A). The N-terminal domain is an elongated domain ∼45 Å in length featuring several long β-strands and a subdomain of shorter strands and small helices. The subdomain interacts with a protruding loop from the transpeptidase domain in a similar way as observed in other high molecular mass PBP structures (28Lim D. Strynadka N.C. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2002; 9: 870-876PubMed Google Scholar, 29Contreras-Martel C. Job V. Di Guilmi A.M. Vernet T. Dideberg O. Dessen A. J. Mol.

Within the N-terminal domain and in both molecules of the crystallographic asymmetric unit, residues 91-163 cannot be located in the electron density map and are presumably disordered. Mass spectrometry confirmed this region was present in the protein construct (data not shown). The functional role of the N-terminal domain in PBP2 is unknown. However, as has been suggested previously for the C-terminal domain of PBP5 from E. coli (50Davies C. White S.W. Nicholas R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 616-623Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), such domains may serve to"

A large increase in the Ca(2+) sensitivity of force and ATPase (Delta pCa(50)>0.25) and a significant decrease in maximal force and ATPase were observed in skinned muscle fibers from Tg-D166V mice compared with control mice. The cross-bridge dissociation rate g was dramatically decreased, whereas the energy cost (ATPase/force) was slightly increased in Tg-D166V fibers compared with controls. The calculated average force per D166V cross-bridge was also reduced. Intact papillary muscle data demonstrated prolonged force transients with no change in calcium transients in Tg-D166V fibers compared with control fibers. Histopathological examination revealed fibrotic lesions in the hearts of the older D166V mice. Our results suggest that a charge effect of the D166V mutation and/or a mutation-dependent decrease in RLC phosphorylation could initiate the slower kinetics of the D166V cross-bridges and ultimately affect the regulation of cardiac muscle contraction. Profound cellular changes observed in Tg-D166V myocardium when placed in vivo could trigger a series of pathological responses and result in poor prognosis for D166V-positive patients."

These results demonstrate that variously processed and targeted mtRNAs within mammalian mitochondria likely have multiple functions in addition to their conventional roles. The normal fate of an RNA transcript is to exit the transcription complex and proceed to its functional site in the cell. An exception is the retention of the RNA paired to its DNA template complement as an RNA-DNA hybrid. These RNA-DNA hybrids, or R-loops, are typically found at origins of DNA replication. An early example of this phenomenon is the plasmid ColE1 replication origin in Escherichia coli, where R-loops are formed during transcription and then processed into shorter primers that sponsor DNA replication (1Itoh T. Tomizawa J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 2450-2454Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar).

After initiation at OH, unidirectional synthesis proceeds along the template while displacing the opposite strand up to a distance of about two-thirds around the 16-kb circular genome. Here, the nascent strand reaches the opposite strand-specific origin, OL, where synthesis of the second strand initiates. Elongation of the second strand then continues along the previously displaced single-stranded template in the opposite direction. Both strands are extended in an asymmetric manner until two daughter molecules are formed (6Clayton D.A. IUBMB Life. 2003; 55: 213-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 7Falkenberg M. Larsson N.G. Gustafsson C.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2007; 76: 679-699Crossref PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar). Recently, we and others have proposed alternative modes of mtDNA replication with initiation sites in addition to the site-specific origins described initially (8Bowmaker M. Yang M.Y. Yasukawa T. Reyes A. Jacobs H.T. Huberman J.A. Holt I.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 50961-50969Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 9Yasukawa T. Reyes A. Cluett T.J. Yang M.Y.

Genes Dev. 2005; 19: 2466-2476Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 11Brown T.A. Clayton D.A. Cell Cycle. 2006; 5: 917-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Specifically, we have proposed that light-strand replication initiation can occur at various locations other than OL, as alternative light-strand origins (altOL) (10Brown T.A. Cecconi C. Tkachuk A.N. Bustamante C. Clayton D.A. Genes Dev. 2005; 19: 2466-2476Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 11Brown T.A. Clayton D.A. Cell Cycle. 2006; 5: 917-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). This altOL modification of the standard model only requires, on occasion, a reduction in the asymmetry and a mechanism to initiate light-strand replication at locations other than OL. We believe that this model is most consistent with the current total available data. We therefore initiated a search for stable primer RNAs at various locations within the mouse mtDNA genome. We found that primer R-loops at OH are indeed stable enough to co-purify with mtDNA. These RNA primers at OH confirm the position of the major replication initiation site, as well as indicating other novel, but less prominent, initiation sites further downstream. We also found RNAs associated with mtDNA at positions that could potentially function as altOL primers. Sequence analysis revealed that some of the R-loops located at the COII gene had a free 3′-OH, which would make them viable substrates for extension by mtDNA polymerase. Yet, unlike the R-loop at OH, RNAs from the gene transcript R-loops were not sensitive to DNase, indicating that they are not frequently used as replication primers. This is in agreement with imaging data of replicative intermediates (10Brown T.A. Cecconi C. Tkachuk A.N. Bustamante C. Clayton D.A. Genes Dev. 2005; 19: 2466-2476Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 12Pikó L. Bulpitt K.J. Meyer R. Mech. Ageing Dev. 1984; 26: 113-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, we also found that other mtRNAs remained bound to mtDNA that were unlikely to be involved in DNA replication priming. These RNAs were large, pervasive, variously processed, occurred on both strands, and appeared to associate with the mtDNA in a manner that restricted the conformation of the supercoiled DNA. The finding that R-loops were stably bound to mtDNA throughout the genome was unexpected yet was consistent with earlier reports indicating that RNA is closely associated with mtDNA in vivo. These R-loops may be present in some of the mtDNA forms that have been characterized as replication intermediates in two-dimensional agarose gels (9Yasukawa T. Reyes A. Cluett T.J. Yang M.Y. Bowmaker M. Jacobs H.T. Holt I.J. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 5358-5371Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). In contrast to that analysis, however, our results indicate that the R-loops are discrete, heterogeneous, mtDNA gene transcripts and not principally replication intermediates. Pervasive, heterogeneous, and stable mtDNA transcript R-loops provide a basis for the RNA-influenced two-dimensional agarose gel patterns that is independent of active mtDNA replication. Mitochondrial R-loops have features that likely indicate multiple roles in the maintenance and expression of the genome. These include priming of replication at the leading strand origin of replication (OH) and, potentially, at alternative light-strand replication initiation sites. R-looped RNAs also demonstrate an ability to alter the conformation of mtDNA, implying a larger structural role within the mitochondrial nucleoid. Outside of the mitochondria, R-loops have been shown to have both positive and negative consequences. In mammalian immune cells, R-loops mediate DNA recombination en route to immunoglobulin class switching (13Yu K.F. Chedin F. Hsieh C.L. Wilson T.E. Lieber M.R. Nat. Immunol. 2003; 4: 442-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (567) Google Scholar). In yeast, excessive R-loop formation causes harmful recombination (14Huertas P. Aguilera A. Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 711-721Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (547) Google Scholar). In E. coli, R-loops sponsor replication initiation (15Dasgupta S. Masukata H. Tomizawa J. Cell. 1987; 51: 1113-1122Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) and are also thought to limit bacterial growth and inhibit transcription outside of replication origins (16Drolet M. Mol. Microbiol. 2006; 59: 723-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Alternatively, bacterial R-loops are hypothesized to support the repair of arrested replication forks (17Camps M. Loeb L.A. Front. Biosci. 2005; 10: 689-698Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The full roles or consequences of such noncoding functions of RNA within mammalian mitochondria deserve renewed consideration. Isolation of mtDNA-mtRNA Complexes—Isolation of mtDNA-mtRNA from the mouse cell line LA9 was accomplished using the differential centrifugation and ethidium bromide-cesium chloride (EtBr-CsCl) gradient method described previously (18Tapper D.P. Van Etten R.A. Clayton D.A. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 97: 426-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Mouse liver mtDNA-mtRNA was also isolated using sucrose and EtBr-CsCl gradients as described previously (10Brown T.A. Cecconi C. Tkachuk A.N. Bustamante C. Clayton D.A. Genes Dev. 2005; 19: 2466-2476Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Purified nucleic acid complexes were kept at 4 °C in CsCl prior to analysis. An image of such a gradient is shown in supplemental Fig. S1. At the top of the gradient is the protein film. The wide fluorescent band lower in the tube is contaminating linear DNA, which is almost entirely nuclear. The amount of contaminating nuclear DNA did not change substantially whether the mitochondria were isolated using differential centrifugation or sucrose gradients. Below this is the closed circular mtDNA, which represents at most 1/50th of the total DNA in the tube. RNA sediments as a pellet at the bottom of these CsCl gradients. This pellet was reconstituted in DEPC-treated water and used as a source of total mtRNA. RNA and DNA were quantified using a Nanodrop ND-1000 and used directly for both RT-PCR and Northern blot assays. Poly(A)+ purified RNA was isolated from 107 LA9 cells preserved in RNAlater reagent using first the RNAqueous kit and then the MicroPoly(A)Purist kit (Ambion). This Poly(A)+ purified RNA was used as a control for both RT-PCR and Northern blot analysis. For the mtDNA-mtRNA co-fractionation analysis, a 19-gauge safety-winged infusion set needle (Terumo) was inserted 1.5 cm below the lower (mtDNA) band in the EtBr-CsCl gradient tube. Five drop fractions were collected, and 100-μl samples were dialyzed in DEPC-treated phosphate-buffered saline at 4 °C for 20 h. Slide-A-Lyzer MINI dialysis units (Pierce, molecular weight cut-off 7000) were first pretreated with DEPC-phosphate-buffered saline. Postdialysis volumes were noted to correct for dilution of the samples. Mitochondrial DNA concentration was determined using a validated quantitative PCR method described previously using the Roche LightCycler apparatus (19Brown T.A. Clayton D.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 2004-2010Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). RNA was quantified with the Quant-iT™ RiboGreen RNA reagent kit (Molecular Probes) using the supplier's instructions. Samples were pretreated with RNase-free DNase I (Ambion) as instructed to eliminate any signal due to DNA dye binding. Replicates and dilutions were done in a 96-well plate format and read using a Tecan Safire2TM plate reader. Digoxigenin (DIG) RNA Probes for Northern Blots—DIG-labeled, single-stranded RNA probes were synthesized by direct in vitro transcription of DNA templates obtained by PCR using gene-specific primers containing consensus sequences for T7 and T3 RNA polymerase promoters and incorporating DIG-11-UTP (Roche Applied Science). The plasmid p501-1, containing the entire mouse mitochondrial genome sequence, was used as the template and subsequent PCR products were isolated by agarose electrophoresis and gel extraction using a modified freeze-squeeze method (20Tautz D. Renz M. Anal. Biochem. 1983; 132: 14-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar). T3 or T7 promoter-driven RNA probes were transcribed per the manufacturer's instructions (Roche Applied Science) with two modifications: 40 units of Protector RNase Inhibitor was added per reaction, and the incubation was done for 1 h at 42 °C.

Northern Analysis—Purified mtDNA-mtRNA was first desalted to ∼200-400 mm CsCl by ultrafiltration and dilution with DEPC-treated water using Amicon Ultra-4 (molecular weight cut-off 100,000) centrifugal filters. Nucleic acids were then ethanol-precipitated and dissolved in 20-30 μl of citrate buffer. 500 ng of LA9 mtDNA-mtRNA were treated with 1.4 units of RNase-free DNase I (Ambion) or RNase H (Stratagene), denatured with glyoxal/DMSO, and separated on a 1% agarose gel using the NorthernMax-Gly kit (Ambion). Downward capillary transfer was completed per the manufacturer's instructions, substituting positively charged nylon membranes (Roche Applied Science), and RNA was UV-cross-linked to the membrane (1200 × 100 μJ/cm2, Spectronics). Northern blots were prehybridized for 30 min and then hybridized overnight at 68 °C with DIG-labeled antisense RNA probes using the DIG Northern Kit (Roche Applied Science). CDP-Star was used for immunological chemiluminescent detection of the DIG-labeled RNA. Blots were exposed to x-ray film for visualizing the RNA bands. 100 ng of poly(A)+ purified mRNA was used per lane as a probe control. mtRNA Guanylation or Circularization—Ethanol-precipitated mtDNA-mtRNA hybrids and total RNA pellet samples (1-4 μg) were treated with TURBO DNase I using the DNA-free rigorous protocol (Ambion) and circularized using T4 RNA ligase or polyguanylated using the poly(A) tailing kit with E. coli poly(A) polymerase (E-PAP; Ambion) per the manufacturer's instructions, with the following modifications for the guanylation. Samples were incubated for 1 h at 37 °C with 1 mm ribo-GTP in a 50-μl reaction mixture, which was then purified using the MEGAclear kit (Ambion) before RT-PCR. RNA guanylation RT-PCR analysis was similar to that of Kusov et al. (21Kusov Y.Y. Shatirishvili G. Dzagurov G. Gauss-Muller V. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: E57Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Rapid Amplification of cDNA Ends (RACE)—RT-PCR was done using the FirstChoice RLM-RACE kit (Ambion) to amplify both the 5′- and 3′-ends of the polyguanylated RNA samples with the following modifications. Calf intestine alkaline phosphatase and tobacco acid pyrophosphatase treatments were omitted from 5′-RACE prior to ligation of the 5′-RACE adaptor (Ambion). The gene-specific primer 4FS (5′-cgtagagaggggagagcaattatg-3′) was used for 5′-RT of the COII gene. The universal primer 3′-RACE oligo(dC) linker (5′-gctgtcaacgatacgctacgtaacggcatgacagtgcccccccccc-3′) was used for 3′-RT of the COII and Cyt b genes. RT-PCR across the 3′-to-5′ junction was done on the circularized RNA samples using HIV-1 reverse transcriptase (Ambion). This assay is similar to that used by Tomecki et al. (22Tomecki R. Dmochowska A. Gewartowski K. Dziembowski A. Stepien P.P. Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: 6001-6014Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). First strand cDNA synthesis was accomplished using 3′-RACE COII nested (5′-ctgccaatagaacttccaatcc-3′) as the primer. Samples and primer were first denatured at 70 °C for 3 min and reverse transcribed at 50 °C for 1 h. The RT reaction was stopped by heat inactivation at 92 °C for 10 min. All cDNA products were PCR-amplified using Plati-numTaq DNA polymerase (Invitrogen). Amplification of the 5′-end of the COII gene was done using 5′-RACE Outer (Ambion) as the forward primer and 4FS or 4N (5′-taggggatgtggcgtcttgt-3′) as the reverse. 3′-End amplification was done using Generacer 3′ (Ambion) as the reverse primer and 3′-RACE COII (5′-aagttgataaccgagtcgttctg-3′), 3′-RACE COII nested (5′-ctgccaatagaacttccaatcc-3′). or 3′-RACE COII nested 2 (5′-atcaagcaacagtaacatcaaacc-3′) and 3′-RACE CytB (5′-gccctaatacctttccttcatacc-3′) or 3′-RACE CytB nested (5′-ctaatattccgcccaatcacac-3′) as the gene-specific forward primers for the COII and Cyt b genes, respectively. The primers used for amplifying cDNA across the circularized RNA junctions were 3′-RACE COII nested 2 (forward) and 4FS or 4N (reverse) for the COII gene. PCR products were cloned using the pGEM-T Easy vector (Promega) and sequenced with M13for and M13rev primers. Atomic Force Microscopy—Immobilization of the DNA-protein complexes onto a mica surface was done as described previously (23Rivetti C. Guthold M. Bustamante C. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4464-4475Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Briefly, CsCl-purified mtDNA-mtRNA was desalted, and buffer was exchanged into 4 mm HEPES, 10 mm NaCl, 2 mm MgCl2 as the mica binding buffer using the Amicon Ultra-4 filters described above. DNase-free RNase A purchased from Ambion was used at a final concentration of 0.04 ng/μl for 10 min at 37 °C. A 20-μl volume of mtDNA was applied to freshly exposed mica and allowed to attach for 2 min. The mica surface was washed gently with nuclease-free water and dried under a stream of nitrogen. Microscopy was performed with a Multimode AFM with a Nanoscope IVa controller (Veeco) in tapping mode using tips from Nanosensors (PointProbes, type NCH-20). R-loops were detected using E. coli single-stranded DNA-binding protein similar to the detection of D-loops described previously (10Brown T.A. Cecconi C. Tkachuk A.N. Bustamante C. Clayton D.A. Genes Dev. 2005; 19: 2466-2476Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Plasmid p501-1 DNA containing the entire mouse mtDNA genome was purified as described above. Control R-loops using p501-1 were created by first generating a 428-nt single-stranded COII RNA in sense orientation. RNA was created from PCR templates generated from T3 and T7 promoter-containing oligos T3COII2 (5′-cagagatgcaattaaccctcactaaagggagaatggcctacccattccaact-3′) and T7COII2 (5′-ccaagcttctaatacgactcactatagggagacaatgggcataaagctatgg-3′), as outlined above for the synthesis of RNA probes, without use of DIG bases. This RNA was annealed to supercoiled p501-1 plasmid DNA in a 4:1 RNA to DNA molar ratio by heating at 70 °C for 4-6 h in 62% formamide, 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 400 mm NaCl, 1.25 mm EDTA followed by gradual cooling overnight at an initial rate of 8 °C/h and holding to ambient temperature. Buffer exchange and atomic force microscopy (AFM) imaging was done as described above. RNase H treatment was for 30 min at 37 °C with 1 unit in a 20-μl reaction volume. E. coli single-stranded DNA-binding protein (USB Corp.) was bound to DNA at a final concentration of 1 ng/μl. In vitro-generated R-loops were formed on 39% of the molecules screened by random searching under AFM. Dye-binding-CsCl Gradient Purification of mtDNA and mtRNA—Our goal was to isolate RNA species which were stably associated with mtDNA. Contaminating RNAs could potentially confound the analyses. EtBr-CsCl isopycnic gradient centrifugation remains the standard for obtaining the highest purity of closed circular mtDNA. The technique has been stated as yielding lower quality mtDNA preparations (9Yasukawa T. Reyes A. Cluett T.J. Yang M.Y. Bowmaker M. Jacobs H.T. Holt I.J. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 5358-5371Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar) despite evidence to the contrary (10Brown T.A. Cecconi C. Tkachuk A.N. Bustamante C. Clayton D.A. Genes Dev. 2005; 19: 2466-2476Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). An image of such a gradient is shown in supplemental Fig. S1. It is noteworthy that mitochondria isolated either by differential or sucrose gradient centrifugation do not yield highly purified mtDNA as obtained by subsequent phenol extraction (24Yang M.Y. Bowmaker M. Reyes A. Vergani L. Angeli P. Gringeri E. Jacobs H.T. Holt I.J. Cell. 2002; 111: 495-505Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). In fact, the amount of contaminating nuclear DNA co-isolated in such preparations is at least 50 times that of mtDNA (see supplemental Fig. S1). Historically, a nuclease treatment of mitochondria has been employed to lessen the amount of contaminating nuclear DNA (25Kasamatsu H. Robberson D.L. Vinograd J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1971; 68: 2252-2257Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar, 26Robberson D.L. Clayton D.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1972; 69: 3810-3814Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Total RNA centrifuging to the bottom of the EtBr-CsCl gradients represents ∼100 times that of mtDNA by mass. More importantly, supplemental Fig. S1 shows that a fraction of the total RNA also co-isolates with mtDNA in the EtBr-CsCl gradients. The amount of RNA at the same position as mtDNA in this peak is ∼25% of the mtDNA by mass. Processed Replication Primers at the Heavy-strand Origin Copurify with mtDNA—R-loops on mtDNA were initially characterized using Northern analysis. We probed first for the replication primer RNA at OH. Our results indicate that primer RNAs at OH remained stably associated with the DNA template. A schematic of the mtDNA control region containing OH is shown in Fig. 2D. Furthermore, our analysis reveals the major and minor primer RNA to DNA synthesis transition sites in this region. Although the RNA to DNA transition sites were previously shown to be somewhat heterogeneous, in mouse mitochondria the major transition site lies at the promoter distal side of the conserved sequence block CSBI (27Chang D.D. Hauswirth W.W. Clayton D.A. EMBO J. 1985; 4: 1559-1567Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 28Kang D. Miyako K. Kai Y. Irie T. Takeshige K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15275-15279Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), as diagrammed in Fig. 2D. The results in Fig. 2A show primer RNA at this location detected with probe T3#4. The abundant ∼150-nt RNA has a size and sequence consistent with it having a 5′-end at the transcription initiation site and a 3′-end at CSBI, as represented in Fig. 2D. The RNA mapping was supported further by additional probing on the distal side of CSBI, as shown in Fig. 2C, where the ∼150-nt RNA is limited to the CSB region. This ∼150-nt RNA was not extensively sensitive to RNase H, indicating that either the processed RNA is hybridized to the DNA over a short terminal sequence or the structure of the hybrid somehow confers resistance to this enzyme. Therefore, an RNA corresponding to the major RNA to DNA transition site at OH copurifies as a stable R-loop with mtDNA. This RNA also exists in polyadenylated form, as it is abundantly present in the poly(A)+ control lane, perhaps indicating that it is targeted for turnover (29Slomovic S. Laufer D. Geiger D. Schuster G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 6427-6435Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). In addition to the major ∼150-nt RNA, Fig. 2A also reveals a larger species of ∼575 nt. In contrast, this larger species is sensitive to both RNase H and DNase I, indicating that its length contains both ribo- and deoxyribonucleotides. Therefore, this represents replication intermediates in which the RNA has primed synthesis of DNA and the two remain covalently linked at transition sites. The differential sensitivity to these nucleases indicates that the promoter-proximal CSB portion of this ∼575-nt species is composed of RNA. DNase treatment of this species leaves a heterogeneous population of RNA with two distinct bands at ∼525 and ∼350 nt. Lighter exposure of this Northern blot shows that in fact the most abundant RNA liberated from the DNase-treated ∼575-nt species is also ∼150 nt (Fig. 2B). This is consistent with the existence of the major RNA to DNA transition site adjacent to CSBI and two discrete but less abundant transitions further downstream. The ∼575-nt species therefore represents a heterogeneous length of covalently linked RNA and DNA with transition sites at various and discrete locations along its length. Other minor RNA to DNA transitions sites have been mapped previously at assorted locations in mouse mtDNA, which accounts for much of the heterogeneity indicated by the less discrete, smeared signal (27Chang D.D. Hauswirth W.W. Clayton D.A. EMBO J. 1985; 4: 1559-1567Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). However, the more discrete transition sites defined by the DNase-resistant ∼525-nt and ∼350-nt RNAs lie further away from the CSB region and would have escaped most of the earlier fine mapping efforts. These may represent novel primer-initiated replication start sites. To differentiate between primer RNA and DNA extensions, we used probe T3#1, as shown in Fig. 2C. The major species detected with this probe at ∼550 nt is not RNA but rather DNA, as demonstrated by its sensitivity to DNase. This is again consistent with prior data showing that the major RNA to DNA transition occurs at CSBI and that the subsequent DNA strand most often terminates after 540-570 nt, creating the common mitochondrial D-loop structure. This DNA strand is known as 7S DNA (Fig. 2D). DNase I treatment also reveals the ∼525- and ∼350-nt DNase-resistant RNA species seen previously in Fig. 2A, confirming that those RNAs are in fact extending beyond the CSB region and that the DNA portion of these strands is located toward the 3′-end. COII and Cyt b RNAs Also Copurify with mtDNA—We extended our search for primer RNA to a region of the mtDNA thought to contain alternative light-strand origin primers, focusing on the COII and Cyt b gene regions. RNAs from both of these regions were found to copurify with mtDNA. Fig. 3 shows that the COII transcript associated with mtDNA is similar in length to the full transcript. Treatment of the sample with DNase I indicates that this RNA has not been extended by DNA polymerase and therefore is not a significant source of replication intermediates. The RNA is only partially sensitive to RNase H, indicating that it is incompletely hybridized to the DNA template in partial R-loop form. Fig. 3 shows similar results are obtained for the major RNA hybridizing to the Cyt b probe. Again, this RNA is insensitive to DNase treatment. However, it is more fully sensitive to RNase H, indicating additional extensive hybridization or exposure. R-looped RNAs Are a Mix of Full-length, Short, and Long Transcripts with Variable 5′and 3′-Ends—Both RACE and circularized RT-PCR analyses were used to determine whether the partially R-looped COII and Cyt b RNAs have distinctive ends. The data are shown in Table 1. The control population of COII poly(A)+ RNA is most consistently full-length at both ends, with poly(A) tails ranging in length from 8 to 56 nucleotides. The mean poly(A) tail is"

Here we establish that human 53BP1 and MDC1 interact directly through the tandem BRCT domain of MDC1 and residues 1288–1409 of 53BP1. Following induction of DNA double strand breaks the interaction is reduced, probably due to competition between γ-H2AX and 53BP1 for the binding of the tandem BRCT domain of MDC1. Furthermore, the MDC1 binding region of 53BP1 is required for focus formation by 53BP1. During mitosis the interaction between 53BP1 and MDC1 is enhanced. The interaction is augmented in a phospho-dependent manner, and the MDC1 binding region of 53BP1 is phosphorylated in vivo in mitotic cells; therefore, it is probably modulated by cell cycle-regulated kinases. Our results demonstrate that the 53BP1-MDC1 interaction per se is required for the recruitment of 53BP1 to sites of DNA breaks, which is known to be crucial for an efficient activation of the DNA damage response.

Moreover, the results presented here suggest that the interaction between 53BP1 and MDC1 plays a role in the regulation of mitosis. The cellular response to DNA damage maintains genomic stability by reacting to the presence of DNA damage in cells. The response includes activation of cell cycle checkpoints, repair of the damage and transcriptional regulation and activation of apoptosis. Several groups of proteins play a role in the DNA damage response (DDR) 3The abbreviations used are: DDR, DNA damage response; DSB, double strand break; 53BP1, p53-binding protein 1; MDC1, mediator of DNA damage checkpoint 1; BRCT, breast cancer 1 C-terminal; GAR, glycine- and arginine-rich domain; FHA, forkhead-associated domain; IP, immunoprecipitation; GST, glutathione S-transferase; HA, hemagglutinin; MS, mass spectrometry; MS/MS, tandem MS; shRNA, short hairpin RNA; E3, ubiquitin-protein isopeptide ligase; λ-PPase, λ-phosphatase; BRCA1, breast cancer 1; RNF8, ring finger protein 8; IR, ionizing radiation.; the “sensors” sense the damage and transmit signals to the “transducers,” a group of kinases that convey the signals with the help of “mediators” to downstream “effectors,” which in turn execute the response (1Motoyama N. Naka K. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2004; 14: 11-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). The DNA damage mediators function as adaptor proteins that recruit different members of the DDR to sites of DNA damage and introduce them to the transducer kinases, thereby facilitating the signal transduction following DNA damage. Upon induction of DNA double strand breaks (DSBs) this group of mediators relocalizes rapidly to sites of breaks, forming discrete nuclear foci, and its members are phosphorylated by the DDR transducer kinases (1Motoyama N. Naka K. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2004; 14: 11-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). One class of mediators includes p53-binding protein 1 (53BP1), mediator of DNA damage checkpoint 1/nuclear factor with BRCT domain protein 1 (MDC1/NFBD1), and breast cancer 1 (BRCA1); all are large proteins that contain two consecutive BRCA1 C-terminal (BRCT) domains at their C terminus (1Motoyama N. Naka K. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2004; 14: 11-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). BRCT domains are protein-protein interaction modules that are found in many proteins that regulate the DDR (2Derbyshire D.J. Basu B.P. Serpell L.C. Joo W.S. Date T. Iwabuchi K. Doherty A.J. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 3863-3872Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar), and tandem BRCT domains (tBRCT domain) were demonstrated to be phospho-protein binding modules (3Manke I.A. Lowery D.M.

In addition to the tBRCT domain of 53BP1, this protein contains tandem Tudor domains (tTudor domain, see Fig. 1C) that are required for the initial recruitment of 53BP1 to chromatin (7Huyen Y.

Recently it was demonstrated that the interaction between MDC1 and the ring finger protein 8 (RNF8) is required for focus formation by 53BP1 (26Huen M.S. Grant R. Manke I. Minn K. Yu X. Yaffe M.B.

Endogenous 53BP1 and MDC1 were previously shown to be part of the same complex by immunoprecipitation (IP) (20Stewart G.S. Wang B. Bignell C.R. Taylor A.M. Elledge S.J. Nature. 2003; 421: 961-966Crossref PubMed Scopus (719) Google Scholar) with the C terminus of MDC1 mediating this interaction (29Xu X. Stern D.F. FASEB J. 2003; 17: 1842-1848Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). However, it was not clear if these proteins interact directly with each other and, if they do, what the biological role of such an interaction might be. Here we have determined that 53BP1 and MDC1 interact directly and mapped the regions in both proteins that mediate the interaction. We also demonstrated that the 53BP1-MDC1 interaction is reduced following the induction of DNA DSBs and that 53BP1 competes with the phosphorylated form of histone H2AX (γ-H2AX), a known marker of DNA DSBs. Furthermore, we observed that the interaction increases in cells arrested in mitosis. The interaction is augmented by one or more phosphorylation events that occur in vivo on 53BP1 and relies on cell cycle-regulated kinases. Our results demonstrate that the 53BP1-MDC1 interaction is required for the recruitment of 53BP1 to sites of DNA breaks and provide new insights into the interplay between the DNA damage mediators, 53BP1 and MDC1, in the DDR and during mitosis.

Cell Culture, Extract Preparation, Protein Expression, and Purification—293T, HeLa, and MCF7 cells were cultured in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, l-glutamine, penicillin, and streptomycin. High salt protein extracts were prepared according to a previous study (34Li J. Williams B.L. Haire L.F. Goldberg M. Wilker E. Durocher D. Yaffe M.B. Jackson S.P. Smerdon S.J. Mol.

Shiloh (Tel Aviv University, Israel). Extracts were prepared from untreated cells, cells treated with different Gray (Gy) doses of IR (using Faxitron Cabinet X-Ray system, model RX-650, Faxitron X-Ray Corp.), or cells treated with 0.2 μm nocodazole (Sigma-Aldrich) for 16 h. For phosphatase studies, extracts (∼1.5 mg) were incubated with 400 units of λ-phosphatase (New England Biolabs) in the presence of 2 mm Mn2+ only or 2 mm Mn2+ and 50 mm EDTA for 30 min at 30 °C before pulldown or IP assays were done. GST-fused recombinant proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli strain BL21 and purified on glutathione-Sepharose 4 Fast Flow beads (Amersham Biosciences). Antibodies—The commercial antibodies used in this study were: rabbit polyclonal anti-53BP1 (Bethyl Laboratories), mouse monoclonal anti-gamma-H2AX (clone JBW301; Upstate), rabbit polyclonal anti-gamma-H2AX (Bethyl Laboratories), and mouse monoclonal anti-HA (12CA5) antibodies. Anti-MDC1 antibodies included rabbit and sheep anti-MDC1 directed against the FHA and tBRCT domains of MDC1 (18Goldberg M. Stucki M. Falck J. D'Amours D. Rahman D. Pappin D. Bartek J. Jackson S.P. Nature. 2003; 421: 952-956Crossref PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar) and mouse anti-MDC1, clone MDC1–50 (Sigma-Aldrich). Anti-sheep IgG antibodies (Sigma-Aldrich) were used as controls. Immunoprecipitation and GST Pulldown Assays—GST pulldown assays were done with 20 μg of the indicated bacterially expressed and purified GST fusions and glutathione-Sepharose 4 Fast Flow beads (Amersham Biosciences). IPs were done with the indicated antibodies and protein A- or G-Sepharose beads (Santa Cruz Biotechnology or Roche Applied Science). High salt protein extracts (1–2 mg) were added to the IP or GST pulldown assays. Beads were washed extensively with wash buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.2% Triton X-100, 150 mm NaCl) and bound proteins were subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blots. For the peptide-competition assay, 100 pmol of peptide was added to the GST fusions and beads prior to incubation with the extract. In Vitro Binding Assay between Recombinant Proteins—100 μg of recombinant GST-MDC1-tBRCT or -tBRCTm was incubated with glutathione-Sepharose 4 Fast Flow beads for 1 h at 4 °C. The GST was cleaved from MDC1-tBRCT or -tBRCTm by adding thrombin (BD Health Care) for 16 h at 16 °C. The supernatant was incubated with 20 μg of GST-53BP1:1052–1709 or GST-53BP1:667–1052, which were preincubated with glutathione-Sepharose 4 Fast Flow beads. After incubation for 2 h at 4 °C and intensive washes thrombin was added to the reaction for 16 h at 16 °C. Supernatant was subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis with anti-MDC1 antibodies. Blot Overlay—HA-53BP1:1052–1709 or HA-53BP1:1483–1972 were overexpressed in 293T cells, and protein extracts were prepared. Equal amounts of extracts were resolved by SDS-PAGE. Separated proteins were then transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane (Pall Corp.) and blocked overnight in 8% milk powder (Marvel) in TBST (25 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 140 mm NaCl, 3 mm KCl, 0.1% Tween 20) at 4 °C. The membrane was then incubated for 1 h at room temperature with recombinantly expressed GST-MDC1-tBRCT or GST-MDC1-tBRCTm at a concentration of 10 μg/ml in 4% milk powder in TBST. Next, the membrane was rinsed with TBST and incubated with antibodies directed against MDC1-tBRCT. Then the membrane was washed in TBST and incubated with a peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody. Peroxidase activity was detected with the EZ-ECL chemiluminescence system (Biological Industries). In Vivo Phosphorylation Analysis—HA-53BP1:1288–1409 was overexpressed in 293T cells, and protein extract was prepared 16 h after addition of nocodazole. Anti-HA antibody was used to IP HA-53BP1:1288–1409 from the extract. After extensive washing, the beads were split into two tubes, and λ-phosphatase was added to one sample. Both samples were incubated at 37 °C for 30 min, sample buffer was added, and samples were separated by SDS-PAGE. The proteins were visualized by Coomassie Blue staining (PageBlue protein staining solution, Fermentas), and both bands (corresponding to HA-53BP1:1288–1409) were excised for mass spectrometry analysis. Peptides were extracted from the gel with 60% CH3CN, 1% CHOOH, evaporated to dryness, rehydrated with 1 μl of CH3CN, 1% CHOOH, and then diluted with 9 μl of 1% formic acid. The peptide mixture was solid-phase-extracted with a C18 resinfilled tip (ZipTip Millipore, Billerica, MA) and nanosprayed into an Orbitrap mass spectrometry (MS) system (Thermo-Finnigan) in 50% CH3CN, 1% CHOOH solution using a nanospray attachment. Data analysis was done using the Bioworks package (ThermoFinnigan), and data base searches were performed with the Mascot package (Matrix Science). Peptides were positively identified by analysis of MS spectra and subsequent MS/MS spectra. Immunofluorescence—MCF7 cells were grown on poly-l-lysine (Sigma-Aldrich)-coated coverslips and fixated in methanol and acetone after exposure to IR at the indicated times. The coverslips were rinsed in phosphate-buffered saline and blocked for 1 h in 10% fetal bovine serum in phosphate-buffered saline. Cells were then immunostained with specific primary antibodies and with fluorescein isothiocyanate or Rhodamine Red-X-conjugated secondary antibodies (Jackson Laboratories). The DNA was stained with 2 μg/ml 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole. Coverslips were placed on microscope slides using fluorescent mounting medium (DakoCytomation). Slides were viewed using the Eclipse TE2000-E inverted fluorescence microscope (Nikon, Japan) equipped with a 60×/1.4 oil-immersion objective, photos were obtained using a Vosskuhler COOL-1300Q camera (VDS, Germany) and analyzed via the NIS elements AR software version 2.3. Slides were also viewed using the FV-1000 confocal microscope (Olympus, Japan) equipped with an IX81 inverted microscope and a 60×/1.4 oil-immersion objective. After scanning, a maximum intensity projection was generated from the serial sections, using the Olympus software version 1.6. Photos were subsequently processed using the Adobe Photoshop Elements software version 2.0. 53BP1 and MDC1 Interact via a Central Region in 53BP1—Previous work demonstrated that MDC1 co-IPs 53BP1 from cell protein extracts (20Stewart G.S. Wang B. Bignell C.R. Taylor A.M. Elledge S.J. Nature. 2003; 421: 961-966Crossref PubMed Scopus (719) Google Scholar). We repeated this experiment and obtained similar results, using various antibodies directed against MDC1 for the IP reaction and anti-53BP1 antibodies for detection of 53BP1 in Western blots (Fig. 1A and data not shown). We also preformed the reciprocal co-IP and demonstrated that antibodies directed against 53BP1 efficiently co-immunoprecipitated the different isoforms of MDC1 from protein extracts (Fig. 1B). These isoforms probably represent alternative splicing forms of MDC1 (18Goldberg M. Stucki M. Falck J. D'Amours D. Rahman D. Pappin D. Bartek J. Jackson S.P. Nature. 2003; 421: 952-956Crossref PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar). The next step was to map the binding regions in both 53BP1 and MDC1. We first analyzed which region in 53BP1 mediates the interaction with MDC1. Full-length or fragments of human 53BP1, fused to a hemagglutinin (HA) tag (illustrated in Fig. 1C) were overexpressed in cells. We performed a series of reciprocal co-IP experiments, using either an anti-HA antibody to IP the different fragments of 53BP1 and anti-MDC1 antibodies for Western blots analysis (Fig. 1D) or anti-MDC1 antibodies for the IP and an anti-HA antibody for the detection of the different 53BP1 fragments via Western blotting (Fig. 1E). These co-IP studies revealed that the minimal region that binds MDC1 is composed of amino acid residues 1288–1409 of 53BP1 (53BP1: 1288–1409, construct 10) (Fig. 1, C–E). It seems that this region is the only region in 53BP1 that binds MDC1, because 53BP1 fragments that do not include this region do not co-IP with MDC1 (Fig. 1, C–E). The GAR Domain of 53BP1 Is Not Required for the Interaction between 53BP1 and MDC1—The MDC1 binding region of 53BP1 (53BP1:1288–1409) lies upstream of the tTudor domain of 53BP1 and contains the GAR motif (Fig. 1C), which was shown to be methylated on arginine residues (11Adams M.M. Wang B. Xia Z. Morales J.C. Lu X. Donehower L.A. Bochar D.A. Elledge S.J. Carpenter P.B. Cell Cycle. 2005; 4: 1854-1861Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 12Boisvert F.M. Rhie A. Richard S. Doherty A.J. Cell Cycle. 2005; 4: 1834-1841Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). To determine whether the GAR motif is required for the 53BP1-MDC1 interaction we overexpressed an HA-tagged version of full-length 53BP1 in which the arginines in its GAR motif were replaced with alanines (12Boisvert F.M. Rhie A. Richard S. Doherty A.J. Cell Cycle. 2005; 4: 1834-1841Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). We used an anti-HA antibody to IP the overexpressed proteins from whole cell extracts prepared from these cells. Similar amounts of MDC1 were co-immunoprecipitated with either wild-type or mutant 53BP1 (data not shown). We conclude that methylation of the GAR motif of 53BP1 is not necessary for the 53BP1-MDC1 interaction. The tBRCT Domain of MDC1 (MDC1-tBRCT) Binds 53BP1:1288–1409—Subsequently, we determined which region in MDC1 mediates the interaction with 53BP1. A fragment of the C terminus of MDC1 that contains its tBRCT domain (residues 1698–2089) was previously demonstrated to bind 53BP1 (29Xu X. Stern D.F. FASEB J. 2003; 17: 1842-1848Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). We used a fragment of this region, containing MDC1-tBRCT (residues 1883–2089) fused to glutathione S-transferases (GST, GST-MDC1-tBRCT) in GST pull-down assays. GST-MDC1-tBRCT was sufficient to retrieve endogenous 53BP1 or the MDC1 binding region of 53BP1 (HA-53BP1:1288–1409) from whole cell extracts (Fig. 2, A and B, respectively). We next analyzed whether MDC1-tBRCT interacts with 53BP1 in cells. We prepared extracts from cells overexpressing MDC1-tBRCT fused to an HA tag (HA-MDC1-tBRCT). HA-MDC1-tBRCT was immunoprecipitated from the extract, using an anti-HA antibody. Endogenous 53BP1 was efficiently co-immunoprecipitated with HA-MDC1-tBRCT (Fig. 2C), demonstrating that the interaction between MDC1-tBRCT and 53BP1 occurs in vivo. IP of the FHA domain of MDC1 obtained only a very faint band of 53BP1 on Western blot (Fig. 2C). To verify that MDC1-tBRCT is the main binding region, we compared the ability of full-length MDC1 and MDC1 that lacks its tBRCT domain (MDC1-ΔtBRCT) to co-IP 53BP1. 53BP1 was co-immunoprecipitated with full-length MDC1, whereas it was only poorly co-immunoprecipitated with HA-MDC1-ΔtBRCT (Fig. 2D). The ability of HA-MDC1-ΔtBRCT to weakly co-IP 53BP1 from extracts may reflect additional weaker interactions involving other regions in MDC1, or indirect interactions, involving additional proteins that interact with both 53BP1 and MDC1. Altogether, these results reveal that MDC1-tBRCT is the main region in MDC1 that mediates the interaction with 53BP1. 53BP1 and MDC1 Interact Directly—Next we wanted to examine whether the 53BP1-MDC1 interaction is direct or mediated through additional proteins. Bacterially expressed MDC1-tBRCT and GST-53BP1:1052–1709 directly interact (Fig. 3A). As expected, MDC1-tBRCT did not bind an irrelevant fragment of 53BP1 that we used as a negative control (GST-53BP1:667–1052 (Fig. 3A)). To further demonstrate direct interaction we performed a blot overlay assay using a recombinant GST-MDC1-tBRCT as a probe and demonstrated that it specifically and directly bound HA-53BP1:1052–1709 on a membrane containing a mixture of cellular proteins extracted from cells overexpressing HA-53BP1:1052–1709 (Fig. 3B). As a negative control we overexpressed a C-terminal fragment of 53BP1 that does not co-IP MDC1 (HA-53BP1:1483–1972; Fig. 1C, construct 5). As expected, GST-MDC1-tBRCT did not bind this fragment (Fig. 3B). The Interaction between 53BP1 and MDC1 Is Enhanced upon Phosphorylation—We demonstrated that MDC1-tBRCT, a phospho-binding module (3Manke I.A. Lowery D.M. Nguyen A. Yaffe M.B. Science. 2003; 302: 636-639Crossref PubMed Scopus (551) Google Scholar, 4Yu X. Chini C.C. He M. Mer G. Chen J. Science. 2003; 302: 639-642Crossref PubMed Scopus (692) Google Scholar, 5Rodriguez M.

We therefore analyzed whether the 53BP1-MDC1 interaction is modulated upon phosphorylation. We mutated one of the key residues of the phosphate-binding pocket of MDC1-tBRCT, lysine 1936, to methionine (K1936M, tBRCTm). This mutation is known to abolish the phospho-dependent interaction of MDC1-tBRCT with γ-H2AX (35Stucki M. Clapperton J.A. Mohammad D. Yaffe M.B. Smerdon S.J. Jackson S.P.

However, a fully functional FeS cluster was required for Elongator integrity and for the association of the complex with its accessory factors Kti11 and Kti12. In contrast, the association of Elongator with RNA polymerase II in chromatin was unaffected by FeS cluster mutations.

Svejstrup, unpublished data. indicating that the complex performs additional distinct functions in the cell. In yeast, genetic data have provided strong evidence for a role for Elongator complex in tRNA modification (13Esberg A. Huang B. Johansson M.J. Bystrom A.S. Mol. Cell. 2003; 24: 139-148Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (222) Google Scholar, 14Huang B. Johansson M.J. Bystrom A.S. RNA. 2003; 11: 424-436Crossref Scopus (329) Google Scholar). However, the precise cytoplasmic role of Elongator is unclear, and the relationship, if any, between its nuclear and cytoplasmic functions also remains poorly understood (for a review, see Ref. 15Svejstrup J.Q. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2003; 19: 331-336Crossref Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Genetic screening in yeast for mutations that confer resistance toward the otherwise lethal intracellular expression of the killer toxin (zymocin) γ subunit identified genes that were named TOT1–7 (toxin target) (16Jablonowski D. Frohloff F. Fichtner L. Stark M.J. Schaffrath R. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 42: 1095-1105Crossref Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 17Fichtner L. Frohloff F. Burkner K. Larsen M. Breunig K.D. Schaffrath R. Mol.

These genes either encode subunits of yeast Elongator or the Kti12 protein. ELP1 and KTI12 had been isolated previously in independent screens for mutants that render cells resistant to the native toxin (insensitive to killer (IKI) and killer toxin-insensitive (KTI) genes, respectively) (19Kishida M. Tokunaga M. Katayose Y. Yajima H. Kawamura-Watabe A. Hishinuma F. Biosci. Biotechnol. Biochem. 2003; 60: 798-801Crossref Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 20Butler A.R. Porter M. Stark M.J. Yeast. 2003; 7: 617-625Crossref Scopus (52) Google Scholar). These screens also identified the Kti11 protein. Neither Kti11 nor Kti12 is stably associated with Elongator, but both have been shown to physically and functionally interact with the complex (17Fichtner L. Frohloff F. Burkner K. Larsen M. Breunig K.D. Schaffrath R. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 43: 783-791Crossref Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 21Petrakis T.G. Soegaard T.M. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Svejstrup J.Q. J. Biol.

Microbiol. 2003; 44: 865-875Crossref Scopus (59) Google Scholar) and are also required for tRNA modification (14Huang B. Johansson M.J. Bystrom A.S. RNA. 2003; 11: 424-436Crossref Scopus (329) Google Scholar). Unlike Elongator, which has proved recalcitrant to detection at genes in yeast by chromatin immunoprecipitation, Kti12 is readily detected on genes by this assay (21Petrakis T.G. Soegaard T.M. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Svejstrup J.Q. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 280: 19454-19460Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (29) Google Scholar), suggesting that it may also affect Elongator function in the nucleus. Thus, further investigation of the relationship among Kti11, Kti12, and Elongator is warranted. The study reported here was initiated in response to the finding, by sequence alignment, that the Elp3 protein potentially harbors an iron-sulfur cluster (FeS) domain, which was hypothesized to function catalytically in histone demethylation (23Chinenov Y. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2003; 27: 115-117Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (69) Google Scholar). A subsequent study revealed that archaeal Elp3 indeed has an unstable FeS cluster (24Paraskevopoulou C. Fairhurst S.A. Lowe D.J. Brick P. Onesti S. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 59: 795-806Crossref Scopus (105) Google Scholar), making it even more pressing to know the importance, if any, of this domain for Elp3 and Elongator function in eukaryotes. Here we provide evidence that the Elp3 FeS cluster is functional and crucial for yeast Elongator but that it does not appear to be involved in the known catalytic role(s) of the complex. Rather our evidence supports the idea that it provides structural stability and enables interaction with Kti11 and Kti12. In contrast, Elongator interactions with RNAPII in chromatin do not appear to require this motif. Yeast Strains and Plasmids—All of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains used for genetic analyses were congenic with strain W303 (leu2-3,112 his3-11,15 ade2-1 ura3-1 trp1-1 can1-1) and were grown and manipulated using standard techniques. The elp3Δ strain has been described previously (2Wittschieben B.O. Otero G. de Bizemont T. Fellows J. Erdjument-Bromage H. Ohba R. Li Y. Allis C.D. Tempst P. Svejstrup J.Q. Mol.

Details of genomic tagging of the C terminus of Elp1 with His8-TEV2-Myc18 (MycHis) are available on request. A plasmid containing the ELP3 coding sequence with upstream and downstream regulatory sequences was made previously (3Wittschieben B.O. Fellows J. Du W. Stillman D.J. Svejstrup J.Q. EMBO J. 2003; 19: 3060-3068Crossref Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Point mutations in the putative iron-sulfur cluster were generated using a QuikChange XL site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) and confirmed by sequencing. Methods for construction of the Y540A mutant as well as for growth of elp3 strains expressing different Elp3 mutants were described previously (3Wittschieben B.O. Fellows J. Du W. Stillman D.J. Svejstrup J.Q. EMBO J. 2003; 19: 3060-3068Crossref Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Western Blotting and Antibodies—Western blotting was carried out using standard techniques. Elp3, Elp4, and Elp5 antibodies were described previously (2Wittschieben B.O. Otero G. de Bizemont T. Fellows J. Erdjument-Bromage H. Ohba R. Li Y. Allis C.D. Tempst P. Svejstrup J.Q. Mol.

Purification of Wild Type and Point-mutated Elongator Complexes—Elongator expressing Elp1 tagged at the C terminus with HisHA was purified as described previously (25Winkler G.S. Petrakis T.G. Ethelberg S. Tokunaga M. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Svejstrup J.Q. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 276: 32743-32749Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (138) Google Scholar). To purify complexes from the soluble fraction of the MycHis-tagged strains, cells were grown to a density of ∼1.5 × 107 cells/ml, harvested by centrifugation, washed in cold water, and flash frozen in small droplets in liquid N2 without addition of buffer. Cells were disrupted by mechanical shearing under liquid N2 in a freezer mill (Glen Creston) (3 × 2 min at level 14 with 2-min precool and 2-min cool between cycles). An equal volume (w/v) of A250 buffer (40 mm HEPES, 250 mm potassium acetate, 20% glycerol, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 5 mm NaF, 5 mm NaPO4, 5 mm Na4P2O7, protease inhibitors, pH 7.5) was added to the milled powder, and the extract was allowed to thaw completely at 4 °C on a rolling mixer. Lysate was clarified by spinning at 10,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C in an SLA-3000 rotor. The supernatant was transferred to Ti45 ultracentrifuge tubes and centrifuged (40 krpm, 1 h, 4 °C), and the soluble (middle) layer was kept and used in the subsequent purification. Alternatively to prepare chromatin-enriched extracts, the pellet and “murky” lower fraction from the Ti45 spin were resuspended in A250 buffer (approximately 0.2 volumes of total extract volume at start) and solubilized on ice using a Dounce homogenizer. The extract was transferred to a larger beaker embedded in an ice-salt mixture and sonicated five times for 30 s each at 75% output on a Branson 250 Digital Sonifier (cooling 2 min between each sonication). Following sonication, the extract was centrifuged in a Beckman Ti45 rotor (25,000 rpm, 30 min, 4 °C), and the supernatant was used in the purification. Soluble or chromatin-enriched extracts were incubated with 9E10 (anti-Myc)-Protein A beads (approximately 200 μl of beads/100 mg of protein) on a rolling mixer for 1 h at 4 °C. After extensive washing with A250 buffer, the beads were washed and subsequently resuspended in tobacco etch virus (TEV) buffer (40 mm Tris, 250 mm potassium acetate, 5 mm NaF, 5 mm NaPO4, 5 mm Na4P2O7, pH 7.5). Elongator was eluted twice by incubating with 2.5 volumes of TEV buffer containing 40 μg of His-tagged tobacco etch virus protease for 90 min at 4 °C. The eluates were pooled, applied to nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid beads (Qiagen), and washed extensively with TEV buffer. For the chromatin-enriched fractions, an extra wash of 3 volumes of TEV buffer containing 122 units/ml DNase I (Sigma) and 28 units/ml RNase A (Sigma) was carried out. Protein was eluted from the nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose with TEV buffer containing 500 mm imidazole. Elongator-containing fractions were dialyzed against A100 buffer (same as A250 buffer except with 100 mm potassium acetate), flash frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at –80 °C. Details of purification under anoxic conditions are described in the supplemental material. HAT Assays—HAT assays were carried out in a 40-μl reaction volume consisting of 10 μg of core histones (Upstate), 6 μm [3H]acetyl-CoA (2–10 Ci/mmol, Amersham Biosciences), and 10–20 μl of purified Elongator in HAT buffer (40 mm HEPES-KOH, 5 mm Na butyrate, 5 mm MgCl2, 25 mm NaCl, 100 mm potassium acetate, 5 mm dithiothreitol, pH 7.5). Following a 30-min incubation at 30 °C, reactions were stopped by the addition of 14 μl of SDS-PAGE loading buffer and fractionated on 18% polyacrylamide gels. After Coomassie staining, gels were soaked in Amplify solution (Amersham Biosciences) for 30 min and dried, and histone bands were detected by fluorography. In Vitro and in Vivo RNA Binding Assays—RNA electrophoretic mobility shift assays and RNA immunoprecipitations were carried out as described previously (8Gilbert C. Kristjuhan A. Winkler G.S. Svejstrup J.Q. Mol. Cell. 2003; 14: 457-464Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (115) Google Scholar) A Functional Iron-Sulfur Cluster in the Yeast Elp3 Protein—The Elp3 subunit of Elongator has a HAT domain located at its C terminus (2Wittschieben B.O. Otero G. de Bizemont T. Fellows J. Erdjument-Bromage H. Ohba R. Li Y. Allis C.D. Tempst P. Svejstrup J.Q. Mol. Cell. 2003; 4: 123-128Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (391) Google Scholar, 4Winkler G.S. Kristjuhan A. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Svejstrup J.Q. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 99: 3517-3522Crossref Scopus (217) Google Scholar). More recently, the existence of a second conserved N-terminal domain was proposed based on sequence alignment (23Chinenov Y. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2003; 27: 115-117Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (69) Google Scholar). This domain bears homology to the catalytic domain of radical S-adenosylmethionine (AdoMet) enzymes and contains a cysteine-rich motif that might constitute an FeS cluster (Fig. 1A). Indeed the involvement of this motif in the formation of such a cluster in Methanococcus jannaschii Elp3 was recently supported experimentally (24Paraskevopoulou C. Fairhurst S.A. Lowe D.J. Brick P. Onesti S. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 59: 795-806Crossref Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Experiments to study the biophysical characteristics of the FeS cluster in the context of Elongator could not be pursued because of the large quantity of protein (mg amounts) required. We therefore initially set out to investigate the role of this module in regard to Elongator function in vivo. To this end, point mutations (to alanine) were made at positions Cys-103 (a nonconserved cysteine bordering the conserved domain) and the highly conserved Cys-108, Cys-118, and Cys-121 residues in the yeast Elp3 FeS cluster (Fig. 1A). To examine the phenotypic consequences of these point mutations, CEN plasmids expressing the mutant versions of ELP3 from its own promoter were generated and transformed into an elp3Δ strain. In addition, plasmids expressing wild type (WT) Elp3 or no Elp3 were included as positive and negative controls, respectively. WT Elp3 and all mutants were expressed at similar levels as determined by Western blotting, and the ELP3 mutations did not affect the levels of another Elongator component, Elp5 (Fig. 1B). The results of an experiment examining temperature and salt sensitivity, both of which affect the growth of cells lacking ELP3 (2Wittschieben B.O. Otero G. de Bizemont T. Fellows J. Erdjument-Bromage H. Ohba R. Li Y. Allis C.D. Tempst P. Svejstrup J.Q. Mol. Cell. 2003; 4: 123-128Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (391) Google Scholar), are shown in Fig. 1C. Only cells expressing Elp3 mutated at the non-conserved Cys-103 position were able to grow normally at 37 °C and in the presence of 1 m salt. All other point mutants displayed growth indistinguishable from that of the elp3Δ strain. elp3Δ-like behavior was also observed for the same cysteine mutants in other phenotypic assays for Elongator function, such as synthetic slow growth with gcn5 mutation (3Wittschieben B.O. Fellows J. Du W. Stillman D.J. Svejstrup J.Q. EMBO J. 2003; 19: 3060-3068Crossref Scopus (122) Google Scholar) and insensitivity to killer toxin (26Yajima H. Tokunaga M. Nakayama-Murayama A. Hishinuma F. Biosci. Biotechnol. Biochem. 2003; 61: 704-709Crossref Scopus (19) Google Scholar) (supplemental Fig. S1). These results demonstrate that single point mutations in the conserved N-terminal FeS cluster of Elp3 are sufficient to cause an elp3Δ growth phenotype, indicating that this motif is crucial for Elongator function. Purification of WT and Point-mutated Elongator—To investigate the effect of the Elp3 mutations on the activity of Elongator in vitro, we attempted to purify point-mutated Elongator to homogeneity. Previously a two-step protocol for purification of the WT complex via a HisHA tag at the C terminus of the Elp1 subunit was described (25Winkler G.S. Petrakis T.G. Ethelberg S. Tokunaga M. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Svejstrup J.Q. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 276: 32743-32749Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (138) Google Scholar). After tagging Elp1 with HisHA in elp3Δ cells expressing WT Elp3 from a CEN plasmid, we used the phenotypic assays described above to confirm that the cells had normal Elongator function (data not shown). As expected, expression of the Elp3 C108A point mutant in place of WT gave rise to an elp3Δ phenotype (data not shown). Elongator was then purified from 100-liter cultures of these strains as outlined in Fig. 2A (left panel), and the ensuing protein fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE (right panel). Purification from cells expressing the C108A mutant complex was unsuccessful with Elp1 and contaminants comprising the majority of the resultant protein. Even upon extended silver staining, bands representing Elp2 and Elp3 failed to become visible (Fig. 2A, right panel (upper)). Moreover little or no Elp3 was detected by Western blotting (Fig. 2A, right panel (lower)). Bands corresponding to Elp4, Elp5, or Elp6 (comprising the smaller Elongator subcomplex) also failed to appear upon silver staining of the mutant complex (Fig. 2A, right panel (upper)), although some partly degraded Elp5 protein was detected by Western blot (Fig. 2A, right panel (lower)). The proteins contaminating the purifications seemed to differ between successive preparations and were not pursued further. It was evident from these and several other similar experiments that it was not possible to purify the point mutants using the procedure developed previously for WT Elongator (25Winkler G.S. Petrakis T.G. Ethelberg S. Tokunaga M. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Svejstrup J.Q. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 276: 32743-32749Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (138) Google Scholar). One possible explanation for these observations was that although Elp3 expression and stability was largely unaffected by the introduced point mutations (Fig. 1B) they might have an effect on complex assembly and/or stability. More specifically, we hypothesized that point-mutated Elp3 was either unable to form a complex with the remaining Elongator subunits or that the subunit interactions in the complex were altered, resulting in a complex that dissociated and/or became degraded during purification. Co-immunoprecipitation of Elongator Subunits from Cells Expressing WT and Point-mutated Elp3—To address the question of whether holo-Elongator could be assembled with a point-mutated Elp3 subunit, we attempted to immunoprecipitate the complex directly from whole cell extract using the single HA affinity tag at the C terminus of Elp1. However, insufficient amounts of Elongator were precipitated using this approach (data not shown). Therefore, CEN plasmids expressing WT or C108A Elp3 were transformed into an elp3Δ strain in which we had tagged Elp1 with 18 Myc epitopes (27Zachariae W. Shin T.H. Galova M. Obermaier B. Nasmyth K. Science. 2003; 274: 1201-1204Crossref Scopus (233) Google Scholar). 9E10 (anti-Myc) immunoprecipitation was then performed. Fig. 2B shows the results for a strain expressing WT Elp3 and untagged (“No tag”) or tagged (Elp1-Myc) Elp1, respectively. As expected, in the absence of a tag on Elp1, neither Elp3 nor Elp5 were removed from the flow-through relative to the input. Thus, under these experimental conditions, there was little or no nonspecific binding of Elongator to the 9E10 beads. In contrast, the Myc18 tag on Elp1 resulted in substantial co-depletion of Elp3 and Elp5 from the flow-through and a clear concentration of all three subunits in the immunoprecipitated material, indicating that the complex was intact. More importantly, the results for C108A Elp3 looked similar (Fig. 2C). Together these results suggest that holo-Elongator is indeed assembled in both the WT and mutant strains but that the mutant complex dissociates during the multistep purification procedure. Similar results were obtained with C118A and C121A Elongator complexes (data not shown). Design and Use of a New Purification Protocol for Elongator—The results presented above support the idea that point mutations in the N-terminal motif of Elp3 cause a decrease in stability of the Elongator complex. The integrity of FeS clusters is generally very sensitive to oxidation, and therefore it is not surprising that mutations predicted to disrupt this domain may affect the structural integrity of Elp3 and consequently the Elongator complex as a whole. An important aim of our studies was to investigate the possibility that Elongator is a histone demethylase as suggested previously based on sequence homology to radical AdoMet enzymes (23Chinenov Y. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2003; 27: 115-117Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (69) Google Scholar). However, experiments performed with purified Elongator failed to uncover proof for such an activity. Likewise despite repeated attempts, we also failed to find any evidence for an ability of Elongator to bind AdoMet (see “Discussion”). We surmised that these failures might possibly be due to rapid inactivation of the FeS cluster (for example, by oxidation) during Elongator purification. Therefore, key aims of a new purification protocol were to increase the speed of the procedure and minimize the number of freeze-thaw cycles, the salt concentration, and the oxidative pressure. To this end, a new Elp1 C-terminal multiple epitope tag was designed (Fig. 3A). Given the success of the 9E10 immunoprecipitation experiment wherein Elongator was both quickly and effectively isolated at low salt concentration, we again utilized a Myc18 tag. To facilitate efficient elution from the antibody resin, tandem recognition sites for TEV protease were incorporated between the Myc sequences and a His8 affinity tag at the C terminus of the protein (termed MycHis tag). The His tag was inserted to enable further purification and concentration of Elongator after TEV protease-mediated release from the 9E10 resin. Phenotypic analysis of an Elp1-MycHis/elp3Δ strain expressing WT Elp3 from a CEN plasmid confirmed that the tag did not affect Elongator function or expression (data not shown). An outline of the purification protocol developed to rapidly isolate Elongator under non-stringent conditions is shown in Fig. 3C (left panel; see “Experimental Procedures” for details). This procedure enabled purification of Elongator to virtual homogeneity in less than 4 h from the time of cell disruption. To reduce oxidation, all buffers were extensively degassed prior to use. A direct comparison of the purified Elongator complexes isolated by this procedure can be seen in Fig. 3C (right panel). Several observations could be made. The level of contaminating impurities was consistently much lower than observed with the previously used procedure. In our experience, the new tag (which we have now used on numerous other yeast proteins) also dramatically improves on the results achieved with the traditional tandem affinity purification tag (28Rigaut G. Shevchenko A. Rutz B. Wilm M. Mann M. Seraphin B. Nat. Biotechnol. 2003; 17: 1030-1032Crossref Scopus (2285) Google Scholar). Strikingly, however, despite the speed of purification and the mild washing procedures, mutations in the conserved cysteine residues of the FeS cluster still had a significant effect on Elongator integrity. Although the Elp1 protein could be seen in all samples, there was a pronounced loss of Elp2 and a clear reduction in Elp3, Elp4, Elp5, and Elp6 levels (relative to Elp1) in the mutant complexes. In addition, the relative intensity of the Elp1 bands indicates that more Elp1 was proteolyzed in the mutant complexes. These observations were confirmed by Western blotting (data not shown and see below) and were not due to differences in expression or stability of Elp1, Elp3, or Elp5 in the mutant cells (Fig. 3B).

We examined whether single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in genes of the TLR4 pathway and their interaction are associated with the response to whole-cell vaccine (WCV) pertussis vaccination in 490 one-year-old children.We analyzed associations of 75 haplotype-tagging SNPs in genes in the TLR4 signaling pathway with pertussis toxin (PT)-IgG titers. We found significant associations between the PT-IgG titer and SNPs in CD14, TLR4, TOLLIP, TIRAP, IRAK3, IRAK4, TICAM1, and TNFRSF4 in one or more of the analyses. The strongest evidence for association was found for two SNPs (rs5744034 and rs5743894) in TOLLIP that were almost completely in linkage disequilibrium, provided statistically significant associations in all tests with the lowest p-values, and displayed a dominant mode of inheritance. However, none of these single gene associations would withstand correction for multiple testing. In addition, Multifactor Dimensionality Reduction Analysis, an approach that does not need correction for multiple testing, showed significant and strong two and three locus interactions between SNPs in TOLLIP (rs4963060), TLR4 (rs6478317) and IRAK1 (rs1059703).We have identified significant interactions between genes in the TLR pathway in the induction of vaccine-induced immunity. These interactions underline that these genes are functionally related and together form a true biological relationship in a protein-protein interaction network. Practically all our findings may be explained by genetic variation in directly or indirectly interacting proteins at the extra- and intracytoplasmic sites of the cell membrane of antigen-presenting cells, B cells, or both. Fine tuning of interacting proteins in the TLR pathway appears important for the induction of an optimal vaccine response."

https://openalex.org/W2026244196,"Synchronized oscillation in cortical networks has been suggested as a mechanism for diverse functions ranging from perceptual binding to memory formation to sensorimotor integration. Concomitant with synchronization is the occurrence of near-zero phase-lag often observed between network components. Recent theories have considered the importance of this phenomenon in establishing an effective communication framework among neuronal ensembles.Two factors, among possibly others, can be hypothesized to contribute to the near-zero phase-lag relationship: (1) positively correlated common input with no significant relative time delay and (2) bidirectional interaction. Thus far, no empirical test of these hypotheses has been possible for lack of means to tease apart the specific causes underlying the observed synchrony. In this work simulation examples were first used to illustrate the ideas. A quantitative method that decomposes the statistical interdependence between two cortical areas into a feed-forward, a feed-back and a common-input component was then introduced and applied to test the hypotheses on multichannel local field potential recordings from two behaving monkeys.The near-zero phase-lag phenomenon is important in the study of large-scale oscillatory networks. A rigorous mathematical theorem is used for the first time to empirically examine the factors that contribute to this phenomenon. Given the critical role that oscillatory activity is likely to play in the regulation of biological processes at all levels, the significance of the proposed method may extend beyond systems neuroscience, the level at which the present analysis is conceived and performed."
https://openalex.org/W2094467211,"Neural development from blastocysts is strictly controlled by intricate transcriptional programmes that initiate the down-regulation of pluripotent genes, Oct4, Nanog and Rex1 in blastocysts followed by up-regulation of lineage-specific genes as neural development proceeds. Here, we demonstrate that the expression pattern of the transcription factor Rest mirrors those of pluripotent genes during neural development from embryonic stem (ES) cells and an early abrogation of Rest in ES cells using a combination of gene targeting and RNAi approaches causes defects in this process. Specifically, Rest ablation does not alter ES cell pluripotency, but impedes the production of Nestin(+) neural stem cells, neural progenitor cells and neurons, and results in defective adhesion, decrease in cell proliferation, increase in cell death and neuronal phenotypic defects typified by a reduction in migration and neurite elaboration. We also show that these Rest-null phenotypes are due to the dysregulation of its direct or indirect target genes, Lama1, Lamb1, Lamc1 and Lama2 and that these aberrant phenotypes can be rescued by laminins."
https://openalex.org/W1969264228,"Latent membrane protein 1 (LMP1) of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is a proven oncogene that is essential for transformation of human B cells by the virus. LMP1 induces constitutive activation of several signal transduction pathways involving nuclear factor κB, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt, and the mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK) p38, c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (Erk). Sequencing of LMP1 isolated from a panel of EBV+ B cell lymphomas identified three different variants of LMP1, each distinct from the B95.8 prototype isoform. All tumor variants of LMP1 as well as the B95.8 LMP1 isoform were able to induce rapid p38 phosphorylation as well as Akt and JNK activation. Additionally all variants showed similar ability to activate nuclear factor κB. In contrast, only tumor-derived LMP1 variants induced prolonged Erk activation and c-Fos expression. Sequence analysis revealed only two amino acids, 212 and 366, shared by the tumor variants but distinct from B95.8. Point mutation of either amino acids 212 (glycine to serine) or 366 (serine to threonine) from the B95.8 isoform to the tumor variant version of LMP1 was sufficient for gain of function characterized by sustained activation of Erk and subsequent c-Fos induction and binding to the AP1 site. Our results indicate that the enhanced ability of tumor-derived LMP1 to induce and stabilize the c-Fos oncogene can be localized to two amino acids in the C terminus of LMP1. Latent membrane protein 1 (LMP1) of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is a proven oncogene that is essential for transformation of human B cells by the virus. LMP1 induces constitutive activation of several signal transduction pathways involving nuclear factor κB, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt, and the mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK) p38, c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (Erk). Sequencing of LMP1 isolated from a panel of EBV+ B cell lymphomas identified three different variants of LMP1, each distinct from the B95.8 prototype isoform. All tumor variants of LMP1 as well as the B95.8 LMP1 isoform were able to induce rapid p38 phosphorylation as well as Akt and JNK activation. Additionally all variants showed similar ability to activate nuclear factor κB. In contrast, only tumor-derived LMP1 variants induced prolonged Erk activation and c-Fos expression. Sequence analysis revealed only two amino acids, 212 and 366, shared by the tumor variants but distinct from B95.8. Point mutation of either amino acids 212 (glycine to serine) or 366 (serine to threonine) from the B95.8 isoform to the tumor variant version of LMP1 was sufficient for gain of function characterized by sustained activation of Erk and subsequent c-Fos induction and binding to the AP1 site. Our results indicate that the enhanced ability of tumor-derived LMP1 to induce and stabilize the c-Fos oncogene can be localized to two amino acids in the C terminus of LMP1.

In B cells LMP1 mimics the CD40 receptor, although unlike CD40, LMP1 functions in a ligand-independent manner and is constitutively active (4Gires O. Kohlhuber F. Kilger E. Baumann M. Kieser A.

LMP1 activates several cellular signaling pathways culminating in expression of downstream genes involved in cell transformation, survival, and proliferation. Thus, LMP1 plays a central role in EBV-associated tumorigenesis. latent membrane protein 1 Epstein-Barr virus C-terminal activation region 1 tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor TRAF-associated death domain protein Jun N-terminal kinase p38 mitogen-activated protein extracellular signal-regulated kinase, PI3K, phosphoinositide 3-kinase nasopharyngeal carcinoma post-transplant lymphoproliferative disease phosphatidylethanolamine nerve growth factor receptor spontaneous B lymphoblastoid cell lines amino acid(s) monoclonal antibody double mutant activator protein 1 intercellular adhesion molecule homologue of Slimb latent membrane protein 1 Epstein-Barr virus C-terminal activation region 1 tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor TRAF-associated death domain protein Jun N-terminal kinase p38 mitogen-activated protein extracellular signal-regulated kinase, PI3K, phosphoinositide 3-kinase nasopharyngeal carcinoma post-transplant lymphoproliferative disease phosphatidylethanolamine nerve growth factor receptor spontaneous B lymphoblastoid cell lines amino acid(s) monoclonal antibody double mutant activator protein 1 intercellular adhesion molecule homologue of Slimb LMP1 is composed of a short cytoplasmic N-terminal tail required for insertion into the membrane, six membrane-spanning domains that facilitate oligomerization of the protein, and a C-terminal cytoplasmic tail. Within the C terminus of LMP1 are two major signaling domains, C-terminal activation region 1 (CTAR1) and CTAR2. The CTAR interact with tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factors (TRAFs) and TRAF-associated death domain protein (TRADD) molecules and potentially other adapter molecules to activate NF-κB, Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), p38 mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase, extracellular signal-regulated kinase (Erk), and phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K). Several key sites within the C terminus of LMP1 are necessary for proper signaling including the PXQXT motif in the CTAR1 region which mediates binding of TRAFs 1, 2, 3, and 5, and tyrosines 384 and 385 of CTAR2 that are essential for TRADD interaction, the recruitment of TRAF2, and association of receptor-interacting protein (5Brodeur S.R.

Biol. 1999; 19: 5759-5767Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Activation of NF-κB by LMP1 is critical to the survival of EBV-infected B cells. NF-κB activation is highly regulated through association with the IκB complex that prevents nuclear localization of NF-κB. In EBV-infected B cells the activation of NF-κB is initiated through interaction of LMP1 with TRAF2 at CTAR1 and TRAF6 at CTAR2, allowing for activation of the IκB kinase (12Huen D.S. Henderson S.A. Croom-Carter D. Rowe M. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 549-560PubMed Google Scholar, 13Mitchell T. Sugden B. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 2968-2976Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). IκB kinase phosphorylates IκBα, thereby targeting it for proteasomal degradation. NF-κB is then free to translocate to the nucleus and to activate transcription of downstream genes that promotes cell survival (14Haskill S. Beg A.A. Tompkins S.M. Yurochko A.D. Sampson-Johannes A. Mondal K. Ralph P. Baldwin Jr., A.S. Cell. 1991; 65: 1281-1289Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (581) Google Scholar, 15Karin M. Cao Y. Greten F.R. Li Z.W. Nat. Rev. Canc. 2002; 2: 301-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (2224) Google Scholar). Similar to the NF-κB pathway, interaction of the adapter protein TRAF2 with both CTAR1 and CTAR2 (indirectly through TRADD) is required for p38 MAPK activation by LMP1 (16Eliopoulos A.G. Gallagher N.J. Blake S.M. Dawson C.W. Young L.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16085-16096Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). We (17Lambert S.L. Martinez O.M. J. Immunol. 2007; 179: 8225-8234Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) and others (18Vockerodt M. Tesch H. Kube D. Genes Immun. 2001; 2: 433-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) have shown that activation of p38 by LMP1 contributes to the induction of IL-10, an important autocrine growth factor for EBV-infected B cells. Whereas CTAR1 and CTAR2 both contribute to signaling of NF-κB and p38, the activation of JNK, PI3K/Akt, and Erk rely on a single CTAR. Specifically, the CTAR2 domain of LMP1 participates in activation of the JNK pathway through interaction with TRAF6, TRAF2, and TRADD (19Wan J. Sun L. Mendoza J.W. Chui Y.L. Huang D.P. Chen Z.J.

EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6478-6485Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). JNK kinase (JNKK/SEK) phosphorylates JNK, which in turn leads to phosphorylation of c-Jun and activation of the AP-1 transcription factor (20Eliopoulos A.G. Young L.S. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 1731-1742Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). Recent studies implicate LMP-mediated activation of JNK in the efficient progression of B cells through the G2/M phase of the cell cycle (22Kutz H. Reisbach G. Schultheiss U. Kieser A. Virology. 2008; 371: 246-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The PI3K/Akt pathway, in contrast, is activated by LMP1 through its CTAR1 domain. The p85 regulatory subunit of PI3K associates with CTAR1 leading to Akt phosphorylation; however, it is not yet known whether TRAFs or other adapter molecules are involved in this interaction (23Dawson C.W. Tramoutanis G. Eliopoulos A.G. Young L.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 3694-3704Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). The PI3K/Akt pathway is required for maximal production of IL-10 by LMP1-expressing B cells through inactivation of the inhibitory kinase glycogen synthase kinase β (17Lambert S.L. Martinez O.M. J. Immunol. 2007; 179: 8225-8234Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Finally, Erk1/2 is activated by CTAR1 of LMP1 in a Raf/MEK1/2-dependent manner with the possible involvement of TRAF2 and TRAF5 (24Roberts M.L. Cooper N.R. Virology. 1998; 240: 93-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 25Chuang H.C. Lay J.D. Hsieh W.C. Wang H.C. Chang Y. Chuang S.E. Su I.J. Blood. 2005; 106: 3090-3096Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The Raf/MEK/Erk pathway is important in relaying signals from extracellular ligands, including growth factors, from the membrane to the cytoplasm. Activation of Erk may contribute to transcriptional activity of AP-1 through induction and phosphorylation of c-Fos (26Murphy L.O. MacKeigan J.P. Blenis J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 144-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar, 27Murphy L.O. Smith S. Chen R.H. Fingar D.C. Blenis J. Nat. Cell. Biol. 2002; 4: 556-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (749) Google Scholar). Erk activation can affect diverse cellular functions including, survival, proliferation, differentiation, and migration. How Erk signaling mediates these varied functions remains unclear, but the strength, duration, and location of Erk activation as well as the cellular context are likely to play a role. Erk activation by LMP1 is required for malignant transformation of Rat-1 fibroblasts, demonstrating the importance of this pathway in LMP1-driven pathogenesis (24Roberts M.L. Cooper N.R. Virology. 1998; 240: 93-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). However, the role of LMP1-mediated Erk activation in B cells is not known. The majority of studies characterizing LMP1 signaling have used LMP1 derived from the B95.8 strain of EBV, originally isolated from a patient with infectious mononucleosis (28Skare J. Edson C. Farley J. Strominger J.L. J. Virol. 1982; 44: 1088-1091Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, LMP1 is also expressed in association with other latent cycle EBV genes in several EBV-associated malignancies including Hodgkin disease, nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC), and post-transplant lym-phoproliferative disease (PTLD). The characteristic combination of the latent cycle genes expressed and the distinct cellular hosts associated with each of these diseases likely contribute to their unique pathogenesis. However, an additional layer of complexity must be considered as LMP1 molecules that have been isolated and sequenced from a variety of tumor specimens show significant diversity in their predicted amino acid sequence. Variations in LMP1 sequences may have evolved with the virus to evade the immune system and could contribute to changes in the function of this protein. Variants of LMP1 include an isoform derived from Chinese NPC patients that contains a 10 aa deletion in the CTAR2 region of LMP1 (29Hu L.F. Zabarovsky E.R. Chen F. Cao S.L. Ernberg I. Klein G. Winberg G. J. Gen. Virol. 1991; 72: 2399-2409Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). This isoform of LMP1, termed CAO, has been shown to be more oncogenic than the B95.8 prototype of LMP1 in human epithelial cell lines (30Dawson C.W. Eliopoulos A.G. Blake S.M. Barker R. Young L.S. Virology. 2000; 272: 204-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The same deletion was also observed in samples from South American patients with Hodgkin disease (31Guiretti D.M. Chabay P.A. Valva P. Stefanoff C.G. Barros M.H. De Matteo E. Renault I.Z. Preciado M.V. Hassan R. J. Med. Virol. 2007; 79: 1722-1730Crossref Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Comparisons in LMP1 sequences have led to at least two classification schemes. Sandvej et al. (32Sandvej K. Gratama J.W. Munch M. Zhou X.G. Bolhuis R.L. Andresen B.S. Gregersen N. Hamilton-Dutoit S. Blood. 1997; 90: 323-330Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) isolated and sequenced LMP1 from healthy European EBV carriers and patients with EBV disease and described a nomenclature for the grouping of these variants, termed A, B, C, and D, on the basis of common point mutations and deletions. Analysis of signaling pathways by these variants revealed differences in NF-κB and AP-1 activation, although these differences could not be attributed to specific mutation/deletions within the LMP1 gene (33Fielding C.A. Sandvej K. Mehl A. Brennan P. Jones M. Rowe M.J. Virology. 2001; 75: 9129-9141Crossref Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Mainou and Raab-Traub (34Mainou B.A. Raab-Traub N. J. Virol. 2006; 80: 6458-6468Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) proposed another classification scheme on the basis of six LMP1 variants isolated from clinical specimens that differed in their sequence from Groups A-D. All six LMP1 sequence variants could induce transformation of Rat-1 fibroblasts, and no major differences in PI3K and NF-κB signaling were identified (34Mainou B.A. Raab-Traub N. J. Virol. 2006; 80: 6458-6468Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Neither of these studies analyzed the impact of LMP1 sequence variation on signaling in B cells nor has the effect upon the induction of the MAPK, p38, and Erk, been examined. In this study we characterized LMP1 sequence variants in EBV+ B lymphoma cell lines derived from patients with PTLD (35Beatty P.R. Krams S.M. Martinez O.M. J. Immunol. 1997; 158: 4045-4051PubMed Google Scholar, 36Nepomuceno R.R. Snow A.L. Beatty P.R. Krams S.M. Martinez O.M. Transplantation. 2002; 74: 396-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Inducible, chimeric LMP1 molecules were created and expressed to directly compare the signaling properties of the tumor-derived variants of LMP1 with LMP1 derived from the B95.8 strain of EBV. Our results indicate that the PTLD tumor-derived variants of LMP1 and the B95.8 version of LMP1 induce comparable activation of NF-κB, PI3K, JNK, and p38. However, whereas Erk activation by B95.8-derived LMP1 was transient, tumor-derived LMP1 signaling led to sustained Erk activation, the induction of functional c-Fos, and AP-1 activation. Moreover, the gain of function by tumor-derived LMP1 was mapped to one amino acid within CTAR1 and a second amino acid within CTAR2. These results provide the first evidence that specific sites within CTAR1 and CTAR2 determine the nature of Erk signaling by LMP1 and suggest that tumor-derived LMP1 possesses unique properties that generate qualitatively different Erk signals to affect cell function. Reagents—Anti-Erk, anti-phospho-Erk (Tyr204), anti-p38, and anti-c-Fos antibodies were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA), whereas anti-phospho-p38 (Thr180/Tyr182), anti-phospho-JNK (Thr183/Tyr185), anti-JNK, anti-phospho Akt (Ser473), and anti-Akt antibodies were purchased from Cell Signaling Technologies (Boston, MA). Anti-IκB and anti-ICAM-PE antibodies, IgG1-PE isotype control, and streptavidin-PE were obtained from BD Pharmingen. Secondary antibodies including unconjugated goat anti-mouse IgG, horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit, and HRP-conjugated goat anti-mouse were purchased from Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories (West Grove, PA). Anti-nerve growth factor receptor (NGFR) (clone 20.4) and anti-β-actin antibodies were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich, and biotinylated anti-NGFR was obtained from Chromaprobe (Maryland Heights, MO). Cell Lines—The BL41 Burkitt's lymphoma cell line, the B lymphoma cell line BJAB, and an EBV-infected version, BJAB_B95.8 were kindly provided by E. Kieff and E. Cahir-McFarland (Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA). The EBV+ spontaneous B lymphoblastoid cell lines (SLCL) MF4, JC62, VB5, and JB7 were derived from peripheral blood of four liver transplant recipients with PTLD, whereas the AB5 line was similarly generated from a lymph node biopsy of a kidney transplant recipient with PTLD as previously described (36Nepomuceno R.R. Snow A.L. Beatty P.R. Krams S.M. Martinez O.M. Transplantation. 2002; 74: 396-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). All cell lines were grown in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and 50 units/ml penicillin-streptomycin (Invitrogen). LMP1 Sequencing—Genomic DNA was isolated from 5 × 106 cells of SLCL using DNAzol reagent according to the manufacturer's instructions. DNA was used as a template for sequencing of the C-terminal region of LMP1 representing aa 190-386. The following primers were used for C terminus sequencing: forward primer, 5′-TTCCTAGACCTCATCCTGCTCAT-3′, and reverse primer, 5′-CAAGCCTATGACATGGTAATG-3′. Generation of BL41 Clones Expressing NGFR-LMP1—RNA was isolated from EBV+ B lymphoma cell lines using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). Three μg of RNA was used to generate first-strand cDNA with an oligo-dT primer (Invitrogen). Full-length LMP1 was cloned from cDNA and introduced into the pSG5 vector (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The C-terminal region of each LMP1 variant, starting from the HGQRH portion of the LMP1 C terminus and corresponding to aa 185-189 of B95.8 LMP1, was subcloned from the relevant pSG5.LMP1 vector. The NGFR-LMP1 vector was generously provided by W. Hammerschmidt (GSF-National Research Center for Environment and Health, Munich, Germany). NGFR was cloned from the vector and modified to delete aa 272-276 of NGFR (FKRWN) and the 3-aa linker region (RGI). The C terminus portion of each LMP1 variant and NGFR were joined by splicing by overlapping extension PCR with introduction of Xba-1 and HindIII restriction sites. These sites were used to insert the chimera into the pCDNA3.1 expression vector. BL41 cells were electroporated at 210 V, 960 microfarads with 15 μg of NGFR-LMP1.pCDNA3 constructs. The cells were plated (10,000 cells/ml) in RPMI with 10% fetal calf serum, 50 units/ml penicillin-streptomycin, and 0.7 mg/ml of G418 (Invitrogen), and selected clones were expanded and screened for NGFR-LMP1 expression by fluorescence-activated cell sorter. Generation and Expression of Point Mutants of NGFR-LMP1—NGFR-LMP1.pCDNA3 (B95.8 version) was used as a template for site-directed mutagenesis using PCR Quick site mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The following primers were used to introduce a Gly to Ser mutation at aa 212 (sense, 5′-CTCAACAAGCTACCGATGATTCTAGCCATGAATCTG-3′, and antisense, 5′-CAGATTCATGGCTAGAATCATCGGTAGCTTGTTGAG) and a Ser to Thr mutation at aa 366 (sense 5′-ACGCTGCTTTTGGGTACTTCTGGTTCCGGTG-3′, antisense 5′-CACCGGAACCAGAAGTACCCAAAAGCAGCGT-3′). PCR products were sequenced to check for proper substitutions. The new point-mutated NGFR-LMP1.pCDNA3 constructs were transfected into BL41 cells, and stable clones were selected as described above for generation of BL41 clones expressing wild type NGFR-LMP1. Activation of LMP1 by Cross-linking of NGFR-LMP1 in BL41 Clones—0.5-5 × 106 cells were incubated with anti-NGFR antibodies (0.5 μg/1 × 106 cells) for 30 min on ice. Goat anti-mouse IgG antibodies were added (1.7 μg/1 × 106 cells) for various times ranging from 0 min to 24 h at 37 °C to activate LMP1 signaling. When necessary, excess cross-linking antibodies were blocked by the addition of mouse IgG. Flow Cytometry—One million cells of the BL41 clones were washed with phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.1% sodium azide and 1% fetal calf serum and stained with biotinylated anti-NGFR mAb. The cells were washed again and incubated with streptavidin-PE. After two more washes the cells were analyzed for NGFR expression on a FACScan flow cytometer using CellQuest software (BD Biosciences). To analyze ICAM expression, NGFR-LMP1-expressing cells were cross-linked for 24 h as described above, and excess cross-linking antibodies were blocked with mouse IgG. The cells were then labeled with anti-CD54 (ICAM)-PE or isotype control and analyzed by flow cytometry. Western Blotting—BL41 clones expressing NGFR-LMP1 were stimulated for 0-24 h by cross-linking with anti-NGFR mAb and goat anti-mouse IgG. The cells were harvested, washed with phosphate-buffered saline, 1 mm orthovanadate. and lysed in 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% deoxycholic acid phospholysis buffer containing 150 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm EDTA, 10 mm sodium fluoride, 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 50 μg/ml aprotinin, 50 μg/ml leupeptin, and 5 μg/ml pepstatin. Lysates were cleared by centrifugation. 40-60 μg of lysate protein was resolved on SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose, and Western blotting with appropriate antibodies was performed. The membranes were developed using ECL (Amersham Biosciences). Densitometry was performed using an Alpha Imager 2000 (Alpha Innotech Corp., San Leandro, CA). AP-1 Luciferase Assay—293T cells were transiently co-transfected with 1.6 μg of the firefly luciferase reporter plasmid (pAP1-luc), 0.16 μg of the control Renilla luciferase reporter plasmid (ppR6-Renilla), and 0.8 μg of an NGFR-LMP1 expression plasmid using FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science). After transfection, cultures were maintained in normal growth medium (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal calf serum and 1% penicillin/streptomycin) for 48 h and then transferred (without trypsinizing) to 2 wells of a 24-well plate. To induce LMP1 signaling, cells were incubated with anti-NGFR antibodies (1 μg/ml) for 30 min at 37 °C, then incubated with goat anti-mouse antibodies (5 μg/ml) for 6 h at 37 °C. The Dual-Luciferase Reporter Assay system (Promega) was used as described to generate cell lysates and determine firefly and Renilla luciferase activities. Relative luciferase activity was calculated as the ratio of firefly luciferase activity to Renilla luciferase activity. Measurement of Active c-Fos—BL41.NGFR-LMP1 cell clones were activated with anti-NGFR and goat anti-mouse antibodies for 0, 30 min, or 2 or 3 h. Cells were harvested, and nuclear extracts were isolated using the nuclear extract kit (Active Motif., Carlsbad, CA). Five μl of nuclear lysates were used in TransAM AP-1 c-Fos assay (Active Motif) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Briefly, nuclear lysates were added to 96-well plates that were precoated with wild type consensus AP-1 oligonucleotide. After four washes the plate was incubated with anti-c-Fos antibody followed by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody. Developing solution was then added, and the plate was analyzed at 450 nm. Nuclear lysates from 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate-stimulated K-562 cells served as a positive control. Additionally, excess consensus AP-1 oligonucleotide was added to the 3-h time point lysates to demonstrate specificity. Identification of LMP1 Sequence Variants in PTLD-derived B Cell Lymphomas—The extent of sequence variation in LMP1 isolated from a panel of EBV+ B cell lines from patients with PTLD was determined. Genomic DNA from EBV+ B lymphoma cell lines from PTLD patients and the BJAB_B95.8 cell line were isolated, and the C terminus of LMP1 variants (aa 190-386) were sequenced and aligned. Using the nomenclature described by Sandvej et al. (32Sandvej K. Gratama J.W. Munch M. Zhou X.G. Bolhuis R.L. Andresen B.S. Gregersen N. Hamilton-Dutoit S. Blood. 1997; 90: 323-330Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), variants obtained from the tumor cell lines were identified that represent Groups A (AB5), B (JC62, JB7), and C (MF4, VB5) (Fig. 1). Group A variants share the most sequence homology with B95.8 and are characterized by three mutations at aa 212 (Gly to Ser), aa 328 (Glu to Gln), and aa 366 (Ser to Thr). Group B variants are defined by nine amino acid substitutions that include aa 212 (Gly to Ser), aa 229 (Ser to Thr), aa 252 (Gly to Ala), aa 309 (Ser to Asn), aa 322 (Gln to Asp), aa 334 (Gln to Arg), aa 338 (Leu to Ser), aa 352 (His to Arg), and aa 366 (Ser to Thr). Group C clones contain mutations at aa 212 (Gly to Ser), aa 309 (Ser to Asn), aa 322 (Gln to Asn), aa 334 (Gln to Arg), and aa 338 (Leu to Ser) and share the 10-aa deletion overlapping the start of the CTAR2 region (aa 346-355) with the CAO variant of LMP1. Chimeric NGFR-LMP1 Proteins Derived from PTLD B Cell Lymphomas Are Functional—To determine whether differences in LMP1 amino acid sequences correspond to differences in the ability of LMP1 to activate cellular signaling pathways, NGFR-LMP1 chimeric molecules were created so that the NGFR transmembrane domain was fused to the C terminus of each LMP1 variant. To create NGFR-LMP1 chimeric molecules representing Groups A-C, LMP1 derived from the AB5 cell line (Group A), the JB7 cell line (Group B) and MF4 and VB5 cell lines (Group C) were utilized. The NGFR-LMP1 chimeric proteins were expressed in EBV- BL41 cells. In cells expressing the chimeric proteins, LMP1 does not signal unless NGFR-LMP1 is cross-linked with anti-NGFR mAb and goat anti-mouse antibodies. This system permits controlled and inducible LMP1 signaling. Expression of NGFR-LMP1 in BL41 clones was confirmed by immunofluorescent staining and flow cytometry using anti-NGFR mAb. Two clones from each group were used in subsequent assays (Fig. 2A). The clones were named according to their sequence group and, for group C clones, the cell line from which they were derived, either VB5 (Clone C1(V) and C2 (V)) or MF4 (Clone C1(M) and C2(M)). All clones were tested for LMP1 function by analyzing surface expression of CD54 (ICAM) 24 h after NGFR-LMP1 cross-linking as ICAM expression is known to be induced by full-length LMP1 (37Mehl A.M. Floettmann J.E. Jones M. Brennan P. Rowe M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 984-992Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Indeed all tumor-derived clones as well as the B95.8 derived clone were able to markedly up-regulate ICAM expression after NGFR-LMP1 cross-linking independent of the LMP1 variant group from which they were derived (Fig. 2B). Analysis of NF-κB, p38, JNK, and Akt Activation by LMP1 Variants—LMP1 is known to activate multiple signaling pathways through interaction with TRAFs, TRADD, and receptor-interacting protein (9Sandberg M.

https://openalex.org/W2150311508,"Visuo-motor coordination (VMC) requires normal cognitive executive functionality, an ability to transform visual inputs into movement plans and motor-execution skills, all of which are known to be impaired in Parkinson's disease (PD). Not surprisingly, a VMC deficit in PD is well documented. Still, it is not known how this deficit relates to motor symptoms that are assessed routinely in the neurological clinic. Such relationship should reveal how particular motor dysfunctions combine with cognitive and sensory-motor impairments to produce a complex behavioral disability.Thirty nine early/moderate PD patients were routinely evaluated, including motor Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) based assessment, A VMC testing battery in which the subjects had to track a target moving on screen along 3 different paths, and to freely trace these paths followed. Detailed kinematic analysis of tracking/tracing performance was done. Statistical analysis of the correlations between measures depicting various aspects of VMC control and UPDRS items was performed. The VMC measures which correlated most strongly with clinical symptoms represent the ability to organize tracking movements and program their direction, rather than measures representing motor-execution skills of the hand. The strong correlations of these VMC measures with total UPDRS score were weakened when the UPDRS hand-motor part was considered specifically, and were insignificant in relation to tremor of the hand. In contrast, all correlations of VMC measures with the gait/posture part of the UPDRS were found to be strongest.Our apparently counterintuitive findings suggest that the VMC deficit pertains more strongly to a PD related change in cognitive-executive control, than to a reduction in motor capabilities. The recently demonstrated relationship between gait/posture impairment and a cognitive decline, as found in PD, concords with this suggestion and may explain the strong correlation between VMC dysfunction and gait/posture impairment. Accordingly, we propose that what appears to reflect a motor deficit in fact represents a multisystem failure, dominated by a cognitive decline."
https://openalex.org/W2154064190,"Deposition of misfolded proteins with a polyglutamine expansion is a hallmark of Huntington disease and other neurodegenerative disorders. Impairment of the proteolytic function of the proteasome has been reported to be both a cause and a consequence of polyglutamine accumulation. Here we found that the proteasomal chaperones that unfold proteins to be degraded by the proteasome but also have non-proteolytic functions co-localized with huntingtin inclusions both in primary neurons and in Huntington disease patients and formed a complex independently of the proteolytic particle. Overexpression of Rpt4 or Rpt6 facilitated aggregation of mutant huntingtin and ataxin-3 without affecting proteasomal degradation. Conversely, reducing Rpt6 or Rpt4 levels decreased the number of inclusions in primary neurons, indicating that endogenous Rpt4 and Rpt6 facilitate inclusion formation. In vitro reconstitution experiments revealed that purified 19S particles promote mutant huntingtin aggregation. When fused to the ornithine decarboxylase destabilizing sequence, proteins with expanded polyglutamine were efficiently degraded and did not aggregate. We propose that aggregation of proteins with expanded polyglutamine is not a consequence of a proteolytic failure of the 20S proteasome. Rather, aggregation is elicited by chaperone subunits of the 19S particle independently of proteolysis."
https://openalex.org/W2003528295,"With the arrival of the postgenomic era, there is increasing interest in the discovery of biomarkers for the accurate diagnosis, prognosis, and early detection of cancer. Blood-borne cancer markers are favored by clinicians, because blood samples can be obtained and analyzed with relative ease. We have used a combined mining strategy based on an integrated cancer microarray platform, Oncomine, and the biomarker module of the Ingenuity Pathways Analysis (IPA) program to identify potential blood-based markers for six common human cancer types.In the Oncomine platform, the genes overexpressed in cancer tissues relative to their corresponding normal tissues were filtered by Gene Ontology keywords, with the extracellular environment stipulated and a corrected Q value (false discovery rate) cut-off implemented. The identified genes were imported to the IPA biomarker module to separate out those genes encoding putative secreted or cell-surface proteins as blood-borne (blood/serum/plasma) cancer markers. The filtered potential indicators were ranked and prioritized according to normalized absolute Student t values. The retrieval of numerous marker genes that are already clinically useful or under active investigation confirmed the effectiveness of our mining strategy. To identify the biomarkers that are unique for each cancer type, the upregulated marker genes that are in common between each two tumor types across the six human tumors were also analyzed by the IPA biomarker comparison function.The upregulated marker genes shared among the six cancer types may serve as a molecular tool to complement histopathologic examination, and the combination of the commonly upregulated and unique biomarkers may serve as differentiating markers for a specific cancer. This approach will be increasingly useful to discover diagnostic signatures as the mass of microarray data continues to grow in the 'omics' era."

The challenge posed for biochemical function assignment of HADSF members is the identification of the structural determinants that target a specific metabolite. The “8KDOP” subfamily of the HADSF is defined by the known structure and catalytic activity of 2-keto-3-deoxy-8-phospho-d-manno-octulosonic acid (KDO-8-P) phosphatase. Homologues of this enzyme have been uniformly annotated as KDO-8-P phosphatase. One such gene, BT1713, from the Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron genome was recently found to encode the enzyme 2-keto-3-deoxy-d-glycero-d-galacto-9-phosphonononic acid (KDN-9-P) phosphatase in the biosynthetic pathway of the 9-carbon α-keto acid, 2-keto-3-deoxy-d-glycero-d-galactonononic acid (KDN). To find the structural elements that provide substrate-specific interactions and to allow identification of genomic sequence markers, the x-ray crystal structures of BT1713 liganded to the cofactor Mg2+and complexed with tungstate or VO3-/Neu5Ac were determined to 1.1, 1.85, and 1.63 Å resolution, respectively. The structures define the active site to be at the subunit interface and, as confirmed by steady-state kinetics and site-directed mutagenesis, reveal Arg-64*, Lys-67*, and Glu-56 to be the key residues involved in sugar binding that are essential for BT1713 catalytic function.

Polyhydroxylated α-keto acids are incorporated into glycoproteins and glycolipids for the purpose of cell-surface display in prokaryotic and eukaryotic organisms (1Angata T. Varki A. Chem. Rev. 2002; 102: 439-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (1048) Google Scholar). The two most common polyhydroxylated α-keto acids are 9-carbon N-acetylneuraminate (Neu5Ac) 3The abbreviations used are: Neu5Ac, N-acetylneuraminate; HADSF, haloalkanoic acid dehalogenase superfamily; KDN, 2-keto-3-deoxy-d-glycero-d-galactonononic acid; KDN-9-P, 2-keto-3-deoxy-d-glycero-d-galacto nononate 9-phosphate; KDN-9-P phosphatase, 2-keto-3-deoxy-d-glycero-d-galactonononate-9-phosphate phosphohydrolase; KDN-9-P synthase, 2-keto-3-de-oxy-d-glycero-d-galactonononate-9-phosphate synthase; Neu5Ac-9-P, N-acetylneuraminate 9-phosphate; Neu5Ac-9-P synthase, N-acetylneuraminate-9-phosphate synthase; Neu5Ac-9-P phosphatase, N-acetylneuraminate-9-phosphate phosphohydrolase; KDO, 2-keto-3-deoxy-d-manno-octulosonic acid; KDO-8-P, 2-keto-3-deoxy-d-manno-octulosonate 8-phosphate; KDO-8-P phosphatase, 2-keto-3-deoxy-d-manno-octulosonate-8-phosphate phosphohydrolase; KDO-8-P synthase, 2-keto-3-deoxy-d-manno-octulosonate-8-phosphate synthase; PEP, phosphoenolpyruvate; P, phosphate; pNPP, p-nitrophenyl phosphate; TAPS, 2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl)-amino]-1-propanesulfonic acid. and 8-carbon 2-keto-3-deoxy-d-manno-octulosonic acid (KDO) (Fig. 1). KDO is synthesized in Gram-negative bacteria and in plants from phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) and arabinose 5-phosphate through the consecutive actions of KDO-8-phosphate (KDO-8-P) synthase and KDO-8-P phosphatase (Fig. 1) (2Raetz C.R. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1990; 59: 129-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (1041) Google Scholar). Neu5Ac, on the other hand, is synthesized in certain animals and specialized bacteria (viz. animal pathogens) by two distinct pathways (3Tanner M.E. Bioorg. Chem. 2005; 33: 216-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). In animals, Neu5Ac is derived from PEP and N-acetylmannose-2-amine-6-phosphate through the consecutive actions of N-acetylneuraminate-9-phosphate (Neu5Ac-9-P) synthase and Neu5Ac-9-P phosphatase (Fig. 1), whereas in bacteria, Neu5Ac is formed directly from N-acetylmannose-2-amine and PEP through the action of Neu5Ac synthase, obviating the need for a phosphatase. The bacterial KDO-8-P phosphatase has been characterized in terms of both unliganded structure and catalytic activity (4Parsons J.F. Lim K. Tempczyk A. Krajewski W. Eisenstein E. Herzberg O. Proteins. 2002; 46: 393-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 5Wu J. Woodard R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 18117-18123Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). 4At the time that this structure was published, the enzyme function was unknown. However, its high sequence identity with the known E. coli KDO-8-P phosphatase and the juxtaposition of the encoding gene with the KDO-8-P synthase gene is strongly suggestive of KDO-8-P phosphatase catalytic function. Since that time in vitro activity measurements have shown that this H. influenza KDO-8-P phosphatase enzyme is indeed KDO-8-P phosphatase (O. Herzberg, personal communication). The enzyme falls within and indeed has been used to define a specific clade (8KDOP, also known as the Yrb subfamily) of the C0 subfamily of the haloacid dehalogenase superfamily (HADSF) (6Burroughs A.M. Allen K.N. Dunaway-Mariano D. Aravind L. J. Mol. Biol. 2006; 361: 1003-1034Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). Thus, within the genomic sequence libraries, homologues of this α-keto acid biosynthetic enzyme have been uniformly identified as KDO-8-P phosphatase. Recently, our laboratories discovered that one such gene, BT1713, within the capsular polysaccharide biosynthetic locus 7 of the Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron genome encodes the enzyme 2-keto-3-deoxy-d-glycero-d-galacto-9-phosphonononic acid (KDN-9-P) phosphatase (7Wang L. Lu Z. Allen K.N. Mariano P. Dunaway-Mariano D. Chem. Biol. 2008; 15: 893-897Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). This 9-carbon α-keto acid, 2-keto-3-deoxy-d-glycero-d-galacto-nononic acid (KDN), structurally related to KDO-8-P, is also formed in Neu5Ac-synthesizing animals (8Inoue S. Kitajima K. Glycoconj. J. 2006; 23: 277-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). The presence of a second putative KDO-8-P phosphatase BT1677 (Expasy accession Q8A748; 24.8% sequence identity with BT1713; and 29.8 and 25.1% sequence identity with KDO-8-P phosphatase from Escherichia coli and Haemophilus influenzae, respectively) in B. thetaiotaomicron alerted us to the fact that BT1713 most likely had a related but not identical function to KDO-8-P phosphatase. Subsequent kinetic analysis of the gene products of the locus demonstrated that in this human gut symbiont KDN is biosynthesized from PEP and mannose 6-phosphate via the consecutive actions of KDN-9-P synthase (BT1714) and the KDN-9-P phosphatase (BT1713) (Fig. 1) (7Wang L. Lu Z. Allen K.N. Mariano P. Dunaway-Mariano D. Chem. Biol. 2008; 15: 893-897Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). These findings highlight the need for distinctive sequence markers for the assignment of biochemical function. Despite the relatively high sequence identity (28.2%) with the E. coli KDO-8-P phosphatase, the divergence of function in the B. thetaiotaomicron KDN-9-P phosphatase is evidenced by a 50-fold greater efficiency in hydrolysis of KDN-9-P versus KDO-8-P (7Wang L. Lu Z. Allen K.N. Mariano P. Dunaway-Mariano D. Chem. Biol. 2008; 15: 893-897Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Thus, significant alterations in the ancestral KDO-8-P phosphatase catalytic scaffold have occurred that are not obvious from sequence gazing. One approach to this problem is to utilize the three-dimensional structure of KDN-9-P phosphatase complexed with ligands to find the structural elements that provide substrate-specific interactions. Those structurally identified residues that are conserved differentially between KDO-8-P phosphatases and KDN-9-P phosphatases in the genome sequences can then be considered markers. The markers can be connected definitively to function by observed spatial juxtaposition of the phosphatase genes with genes encoding the corresponding synthase homologue. Here, we provide the results of this line of attack for KDN-9-P phosphatase. Three x-ray crystallographic structures of KDN-9-P phosphatase bound to Mg2+ and acetate, the product analogue tungstate, and the intermediate analogue vanadate plus N-acetylneuraminate (Neu5Ac) are used to delineate and analyze the structural basis for substrate recognition and catalysis in KDN-9-P phosphatase. The analysis provides sequence markers that may be useful in the future annotation of KDN-9-P phosphatase sequences. Except where indicated, all chemicals and enzymes were obtained from Sigma. The Malachite Green phosphate assay kit was purchased from Biomol. Recombinant wild-type BT1713 was isolated from transformed and induced E. coli cells and purified to homogeneity (as judged by SDS-PAGE analysis) as described previously (7Wang L. Lu Z. Allen K.N. Mariano P. Dunaway-Mariano D. Chem. Biol. 2008; 15: 893-897Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). BT1713 Site-directed Mutant—All BT1713 mutant genes were prepared by a PCR-based strategy with commercial primers and the WT-BT1713 plasmid described previously (7Wang L. Lu Z. Allen K.N. Mariano P. Dunaway-Mariano D. Chem. Biol. 2008; 15: 893-897Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) serving as template. The gene sequences were confirmed by DNA sequencing carried out by the Center for Genetics in Medicine at the University of New Mexico. All BTI713 mutants were isolated and purified to homogeneity (as judged by SDS-PAGE analysis) from transformed and induced E. coli cells using the same protocol used for wild-type BT1713. Native Molecular Weight Determination—The molecular weight of native BT1713 was estimated by fast protein liquid chromatography gel filtration column chromatography against protein standards (25-232 kDa from Amersham Biosciences) using a 2.5 × 120-cm Sephacryl S-200 column (Amersham Biosciences) eluted at 25 °C with 50 mm HEPES, 100 mm NaCl (pH 7.5). The mass was calculated from a plot of log molecular weight versus elution volume from the column. Kinetic Constant Determination—The purified recombinant enzyme was concentrated with an Amicon Ultrafiltration apparatus (PM10) or Centricon-10 (Millipore) and dialyzed against 50 mM K+HEPES, 5 mM MgCl2 and 0.5 mM DTT before use in kinetic studies. The steady-state kinetic parameters (Km and kcat) of phosphorylated substrates were determined from initial reaction velocities measured at varying substrate concentrations for reactions containing 5 mm MgCl2 in 50 mm K+HEPES buffer (pH 7.0) at 37 °C. The assay methods used for the various substrates are described below. Protein concentrations were determined by the Bradford assay (9Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217544) Google Scholar), and absorbance measurements were performed on a PerkinElmer Life Sciences λ25 UV-visible spectrophotometer or a Beckman DU800 spectrophotometer. Data were fit to Equation 1 with the KinetAsyst I program, V0 = Vmax[S]/(Km + [S])(Eq. 1) where V0 = initial velocity, Vmax = maximum velocity, [S] = substrate concentration, and Km = Michaelis-Menten constant for substrate. The kcat value was calculated from Vmax and [E] according to the equation kcat = Vmax/[E], where [E] is the free enzyme concentration. Inhibition constants for acetate, N-acetylneuraminate, tungstate, and vanadate were determined from initial velocity data measured in the presence and absence of inhibitors and fitted to Equation 2 (for competitive inhibition), V0 = Vmax[S]/(Km(1 + (I/Ki)) + [S])(Eq. 2) where [I] is the inhibitor concentration and Ki is the inhibition constant. The Km for Mg2+ activation was measured using reaction solutions initially containing 1.5, 2, 5, 10, or 20 μm MgCl2, 0.1 μm BT1713, 300 μm KDN 9-P, 5 units of Neu5Ac aldolase, 10 units of lactate dehydrogenase, and 0.2 mm NADH in 50 mm K+HEPES (pH 7.0, 25 °C). Reactions were monitored at 340 nm (Δ∊ = 6200 m-1 cm-1), and the initial velocity data were fitted to Equation 1. Phosphatase Discontinuous Assays—Phosphate ester hydrolysis for all substrates was monitored using the Biomol green kit to detect total phosphate release. The 1-ml assay mixture, containing 50 mm K+HEPES buffer (pH 7.0), 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm substrate, and 1.9 μm BT1713, was incubated at 37 °C for 10 min. In parallel, the background level of inorganic phosphate was measured using a reaction that excluded BT1713. For analysis, 100 μl of the mixture was added to 1 ml of Biomol green reagent. After 30 min of incubation at room temperature, the absorbance of the solution at 620 nm was measured. Steady-state kinetic constant determinations were carried out using reaction solutions containing BT1713 (0.1-0.4 μm) and varying concentrations of phosphate ester (Km 0.5-5). Phosphatase Continuous Assays—The rate of p-nitrophenyl phosphate (pNPP) hydrolysis was determined by monitoring the increase in absorbance at 410 nm (Δ∊ = 18.4 mm-1 cm-1) at 25 or 37 °C. The 0.5-ml assay mixtures contained 50 mm HEPES buffer (pH 7.0), 5 mm MgCl2, various concentrations (Km 0.5-5) of pNPP, and 1.9 μm BT1713. The rate of β-d-glucose 6-phosphate hydrolysis was determined by monitoring the rate of NADPH formation at 340 nm (Δ∊ = 6.22 mm-1 cm-1) at 37 °C in a 0.5-ml coupled assay solution containing 50 mm K+HEPES buffer (pH 7.0), 5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm NADP+, and 0.5 unit of glucose dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.1.119) and various concentrations (Km 0.5-5) of β-d-glucose 6-phosphate. The kinetic constants determined using this assay agreed with those determined using the discontinuous phosphate assay described above. The rate of PEP (phosphoenolpyruvate) hydrolysis was determined by monitoring the rate of NADH (340 nm; Δ∊ = 6.22 mm-1 cm-1) decrease at 37 °C in a 0.5-ml coupled assay solution initially containing 50 mm K+HEPES buffer (pH 7.0), 5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm NADH, and 2 units of l-lactate dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.1.27) and various concentrations (Km 0.5-5) of PEP. The kinetic constants determined with this assay agreed with those determined using the discontinuous phosphate assay described above. Crystallization and X-ray Diffraction Data Collection—BT1713 crystals were obtained at room temperature using the vapor diffusion method with hanging-drop geometry. The protein solution (35 mg/ml protein in 1 mm HEPES buffer (pH 7.0)) was screened for crystallization by sparse-matrix screening using Crystal Screen Kits I and II (Hampton Research). Large crystals grew in 1 day at room temperature (25 °C) with overall dimensions >0.3 × 0.3 × 0.2 mm under several conditions. Crystals from the following two conditions were found to yield the best diffraction: 1) 0.2 m calcium chloride, 0.1 m sodium acetate (pH 4.6), and 20% v/v isopropyl alcohol; and 2) 30% w/v polyethylene glycol (PEG) 4000, 0.1 m Tris HCl (pH 8.5), and 0.2 m sodium acetate. Crystals from the calcium chloride/sodium acetate/isopropyl alcohol condition were frozen for data collection by passing through 100% Paratone-N (Hampton Research) and freezing directly in a stream of N2 gas at 100 K. Diffraction data were collected to 2.13-Å resolution using CuKα radiation from a Rigaku RUH3 generator equipped with the R axis IV++ image plate located at Boston University School of Medicine. Diffraction data were collected at 100 K and indexed and scaled using DENZO and SCALEPACK (10Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38617) Google Scholar). The crystals are orthorhombic, belonging to space group C2221 with unit cell dimensions a = 112.01 Å, b = 118.46 Å, and c = 116.35 Å. The unit cell volume is consistent with the presence of a tetramer in the asymmetric unit assuming a Matthew's coefficient of 2.3. Crystals grown from PEG were refined by using a protein solution containing 40 mg/ml BT1713, 1 mm HEPES (pH 7.0), and 10 mm MgCl2. Crystals were frozen for data collection as for the calcium chloride condition. X-ray diffraction data were collected at the National Synchrotron Light Source, Beamline X12C equipped with an ADSC CCD Quantum 210 detector at Brookhaven National Laboratory. Diffraction data were collected at 100 K at 1.1-Å resolution and indexed and scaled using DENZO and SCALEPACK (10Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38617) Google Scholar).

Open table in a new tab Co-crystallization of BT1713 with various ligands failed initially. To obtain the BT1713 ligand complex, crystals grown from PEG were soaked to remove bound acetate in either 35% PEG 4000, 0.06 m TAPS (pH 8.5), 50 mm sodium tungstate plus 10 mm MgCl2 or in 35% PEG 4000, 0.06 m TAPS (pH 8.5), 20 mm activated NaVO3, 100 mm Neu5Ac plus 10 mm MgCl2 for 15 min at room temperature. Soaked crystals were frozen for data collection as for the calcium chloride condition. Diffraction data were collected to 1.85-Å resolution (for the tungstate complex) or 1.63-Å resolution (for the VO3--Neu5Ac complex) using CuKα radiation from a Rigaku RUH3 generator equipped with the R-Axis IV++ image plate located at Boston University School of Medicine. Data were indexed and scaled using DENZO and SCALEPACK (10Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38617) Google Scholar). Both crystals are orthorhombic, similar to the native PEG crystals, belonging to space group P21212 with unit cell dimensions a = 82.13 Å, b = 107.32 Å, c = 75.36 Å (for the tungstate complex) and a = 81.96 Å, b = 106.66 Å, and c = 74.90 Å (for the VO3-/Neu5Ac complex). Data collection statistics are summarized in Table 1. Phase Determination and Model Refinement—The phase problem was solved via molecular replacement using the structure of KDO-8-P phosphatase (Protein Data Bank accession code 1K1E (4Parsons J.F. Lim K. Tempczyk A. Krajewski W. Eisenstein E. Herzberg O. Proteins. 2002; 46: 393-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar)) as the search model (30% sequence identity to BT1713). Because the unit cell volume of BT1713 is consistent with the presence of a tetramer in the asymmetric unit and because KDO-8-P phosphatase exists as a tetramer in solution (5Wu J. Woodard R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 18117-18123Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), the tetramer of KDO-8-P phosphatase was used as the search model. The program MOLREP (11Vagin A. Teplyakov A. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1997; 30: 1022-1025Crossref Scopus (4175) Google Scholar) in the CCP4 program suite was used to solve the rotation and translation functions, yielding a solution with a correlation coefficient of 38.8% and an R-factor of 60.5% at 2.85-Å resolution. Although the R-factor was high, the difference in correlation coefficient between this solution and the next best solution was large, and the resulting model gave no overlap between symmetry mates. In addition the R-factor dropped significantly to 40% during the initial stages of rigid body refinement and model building. Successive rounds of manual rebuilding were performed using the molecular graphics program O (12Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13014) Google Scholar) alternated with minimization and simulated annealing in CNS (13Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P.

Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16979) Google Scholar). The model obtained for crystals grown from the calcium chloride/sodium acetate/isopropyl alcohol solution was used as the search model for the BT1713 data sets collected on the crystals grown from PEG. Successive rounds of manual rebuilding were performed using the molecular graphics program COOT (14Emsley P. Cowtan K. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2004; 60: 2126-2132Crossref PubMed Scopus (23628) Google Scholar) alternated with minimization and simulated annealing in PHENIX (15Adams P.D. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Hung L.W.

Crystallogr. 2002; 58: 1948-1954Crossref PubMed Scopus (3667) Google Scholar). To avoid model bias, ligand molecules were added when Rfree (16Brünger A.T. Nature. 1992; 355: 472-474Crossref PubMed Scopus (3872) Google Scholar) was <30%; waters were also added at this stage. Analysis of the Ramachandran plot as defined by PROCHECK (17Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar) showed that 97.2-97.5% of residues fall in the most favored regions with 2.8 to 2.5% in the additionally allowed regions and with no residues falling in the generously allowed or disallowed regions. Refinement statistics are summarized in Table 1. Bioinformatics—The “8KDO” clade sequences containing the Glu-56 sequence marker were identified as follows. The sequences annotated as KDO-8-P phosphatase contained in the KEGG gene data bank were aligned, and the sequences containing Glu in place of the H. influenza KDO-8-P phosphatase Arg-60 were selected. Next, the BT1713 sequence was used as query in a Phyre search (18Bennett-Lovsey R.M. Herbert A.D. Sternberg M.J. Kelley L.A. Proteins. 2008; 70: 611-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar), and the sequences identified in the multisequence alignment to contain Glu-56 were selected. A nonredundant list of sequences was constructed from which a few sequences were selected and used as query sequences in Expasy/SIB BLAST searches. The final set of 25 sequences (from a pool of ∼400 8KDO clade sequences) were aligned using ClustalW (19Higgins D.G. Methods Mol. Biol. 1994; 25: 307-318PubMed Google Scholar). BT1713(Mg2+) Crystal Structure—The three-dimensional structure of KDN-9-P phosphatase complexed with ligands was determined to find the structural elements that provide substrate-specific interactions. As for all HADSF phosphotransferases, the cofactor Mg2+ is required for BT1713 catalysis; the Km value for Mg2+ activation of BT1713-catalyzed hydrolysis of 300 μm KDN-9P measured at pH 7 is 3.3 ± 0.1 μm. The x-ray structure of BT1713 complexed with Mg2+ was determined at 1.1-Å resolution (Table 1; Fig. 2). The final model includes four BT1713 subunits (all 164 residues from each subunit), four Mg2+, five Cl-, and six acetate molecules. The N-terminal Met residue and C-terminal Gln residue are visible but have a higher B-factor as compared with the average B-factor for the entire protein. The tetramer exhibits pseudo P4 symmetry; the four monomers (independently refined with no NCS averaging) are nearly identical with root mean square deviation of 0.17-0.26 Å2 for all residues. The molecular mass of native BT1713 was determined to be 72 kDa by gel filtration, and from the subunit mass of 18.4 kDa it follows that BT1713 is a tetramer in solution, consistent with the quaternary structure observed in the crystal. Like other HADSF C0 subfamily members, the BT1713 monomer consisted of a single α/β domain (modified Rossmann fold) consisting of a six-stranded parallel β-sheet (β1 and β4-β8) surrounded by six helices (α1-α3 and α5-α7) (Fig. 2A). A β-loop-β motif (residues 18-34) is inserted between β1 and α1, the same insertion point as for the cap domain in HADSF C1 subfamily members (6Burroughs A.M. Allen K.N. Dunaway-Mariano D. Aravind L. J. Mol. Biol. 2006; 361: 1003-1034Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). The BT1713 tetramer is built by packing the β-loop-β motif of each monomer together to form a single β-barrel that serves as the tetramer interface (Fig. 2B). The β-barrel cavity (∼10 × 10 × 10 Å in dimension) is packed with four Phe side chains and four Trp side chains (Fig. 2C). The overall structure (i.e. oligomerization and monomer fold) observed for the BT1713(Mg2+) complex is retained in the structures of the BT1713(Mg2+)(tungstate) and BT1713(Mg2+)(VO3-)(Neu5Ac) complexes (see below). This finding indicates that the BT1713 structure does not change upon substrate binding. The BT1713(Mg2+) structure shows that the active site is located at the subunit-subunit interface (Fig. 3). Thus, each dimer within the tetramer is the catalytic unit, with four active sites per tetramer in total. The subunit that binds the Mg2+ and the KDN-9-P (or Neu5Ac-9-P) substrate will be referred to as the “core subunit” and the subunit that serves to cover a portion of the active site entrance as the “cap subunit.” The catalytic scaffold observed in the core subunit consists of a 4-loop platform on which the core residues (i.e. the residues conserved among all HADSF phosphotransferases for catalysis) are located (Fig. 2A). Loop 1 positions the Asp-10 nucleophile and Asp-12 general acid/base; loop 2 holds Thr-54 that binds the substrate phosphoryl group; loop 3 positions Lys-80 that bridges the Asp-10 carboxylate and the substrate phosphoryl group; and loops 1 and 4 bind the Mg2+ cofactor. The Mg2+-binding site is typical of HADSF phosphohydrolases with octahedral geometry (see supplemental Fig. SI1 for electron density map). BT1713(Mg2+)(Tungstate) and BT1713(Mg2+)(VO-3)-(Neu5Ac) Structures—The residues comprising the entire active site are best defined by the structures of the BT1713-(Mg2+)(tungstate) and BT1713(Mg2+)(VO3-)(Neu5Ac) complexes determined at 1.85 and 1.63 Å resolution, respectively (Fig. 4). Tungstate, an analogue of the product orthophosphate, is a competitive inhibitor of BT1713 versus pNPP, and Ki = 350 μm (measured using assay solutions containing 5 mm MgCl2 and 50 mm K+HEPES at pH 7 and 25 °C). Tungstate has been used previously as a product analogue in structures of hexose phosphate phosphatase of HADSF members (C2B subfamily; Ki = 65 μm) (20Lu Z. Dunaway-Mariano D. Allen K.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2008; 105: 5687-5692Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) and phosphonatase (C1A subfamily; Ki = 50 μm) (21Morais M.C. Z"
https://openalex.org/W2020963489,"Neisseria meningitidis serogroup C is a major cause of bacterial meningitis and septicaemia. This human pathogen is protected by a capsule composed of alpha2,9-linked polysialic acid that represents an important virulence factor. In the majority of strains, the capsular polysaccharide is modified by O-acetylation at C-7 or C-8 of the sialic acid residues. The gene encoding the capsule modifying O-acetyltransferase is part of the capsule gene complex and shares no sequence similarities with other proteins. Here, we describe the purification and biochemical characterization of recombinant OatC. The enzyme was found as a homodimer, with the first 34 amino acids forming an efficient oligomerization domain that worked even in a different protein context. Using acetyl-CoA as donor substrate, OatC transferred acetyl groups exclusively onto polysialic acid joined by alpha2,9-linkages and did not act on free or CMP-activated sialic acid. Motif scanning revealed a nucleophile elbow motif (GXS286XGG), which is a hallmark of alpha/beta-hydrolase fold enzymes. In a comprehensive site-directed mutagenesis study, we identified a catalytic triad composed of Ser-286, Asp-376, and His-399. Consistent with a double-displacement mechanism common to alpha/beta-hydrolase fold enzymes, a covalent acetylenzyme intermediate was found. Together with secondary structure prediction highlighting an alpha/beta-hydrolase fold topology, our data provide strong evidence that OatC belongs to the alpha/beta-hydrolase fold family. This clearly distinguishes OatC from all other bacterial sialate O-acetyltransferases known so far because these are members of the hexapeptide repeat family, a class of acyltransferases that adopt a left-handed beta-helix fold and assemble into catalytic trimers."

Phylogenetic and structural studies have shown that the several evolutionary shifts have modified the ligand binding ability of RXRs. To understand the vertebrate-specific character of RXRs, we have studied the RXR ligand-binding domain of the cephalochordate amphioxus (Branchiostoma floridae), an invertebrate chordate that predates the genome duplication that produced the three vertebrates RXRs (α, β, and γ). Here we report the crystal structure of a novel apotetramer conformation of the AmphiRXR ligand-binding domain, which shows some similarity with the structures of the arthropods RXR/USPs. AmphiRXR adopts an apo antagonist conformation with a peculiar conformation of helix H11 filling the binding pocket. In contrast to the arthropods RXR/USPs, which cannot be activated by any RXR ligands, our functional data show that AmphiRXR, like the vertebrates/mollusk RXRs, is able to bind and be activated by RXR ligands but less efficiently than vertebrate RXRs.

Gustafsson J.A. Laudet V. Nat. Rev. Drug Discov. 2004; 3: 950-964Crossref PubMed Scopus (946) Google Scholar). Nuclear receptors are ligand-activated transcription factors. Many members of the superfamily thus bind major hormones, such as steroids, thyroid hormones, or retinoids. These occupy a special position in gene regulation by providing a direct link between the ligand, which they bind, and the target gene, whose expression they regulate. There are also many nuclear receptors that are not known to bind any ligand and are thus called “orphan nuclear receptors” (2Gustafsson J.A. Science. 1999; 284: 1285-1286Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 3Kliewer S.A. Lehmann J.M. Willson T.M. Science. 1999; 284: 757-760Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar, 4Benoit G. Cooney A. Giguere V. Ingraham H. Lazar M. Muscat G. Perlmann T. Renaud J.P. Schwabe J. Sladek F. Tsai M.J. Laudet V. Pharmacol. Rev. 2006; 58: 798-836Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Some nuclear receptors which were originally discovered as orphans have since been shown to bind small hydrophobic molecules, such as fatty acids, but others appear to be true orphans (4Benoit G. Cooney A. Giguere V. Ingraham H. Lazar M. Muscat G. Perlmann T. Renaud J.P. Schwabe J. Sladek F. Tsai M.J. Laudet V. Pharmacol. Rev. 2006; 58: 798-836Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Nuclear receptors are composed of several functional domains. The N-terminal A/B domain is highly variable in length and sequence and contains a constitutively active transactivation function AF-1. Most conserved are domains C and E, corresponding grossly to the DNA-binding domain and the ligand-binding domain (LBD), respectively. The LBD contains the ligand-dependent transactivation function AF-2. The DNA-binding domain and LBD are connected via a flexible hinge (domain D). NRs act in vivo and in vitro as ligand-dependent transcriptional transregulators through binding, most often as heterodimers, to cis-acting response elements present in cognate target genes. Activation of gene transcription occurs after binding of ligand, which results in a conformational change of the LBD, leading to release of corepressor and binding of coactivator to the LBD (5Laudet V. Gronemeyer H. The Nuclear Receptor Facts Book. 2002; (Academic Press, London)Google Scholar). To date, the crystal structures of ∼40 different NR LBDs have been solved, mainly mammalian nuclear receptors. All structures are very similar, sharing a common fold containing 11-12 helices (6Wurtz J.M. Bourguet W. Renaud J.P. Vivat V. Chambon P. Moras D. Gronemeyer H. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 87-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (685) Google Scholar, 7Renaud J.P. Moras D. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 2000; 57: 1748-1769Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). The majority of the LBD crystals were obtained in the presence of a ligand (holo-LBD) and only a few without ligand (apo-LBD). Comparison of apo- and holo-LBD structures led to the so-called “mouse trap model” of the ligand-dependent conformational switch (8Renaud J.P. Rochel N. Ruff M. Vivat V. Chambon P. Gronemeyer H. Moras D. Nature. 1995; 378: 681-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (1034) Google Scholar). In apo-LBD, different positions of the C-terminal helix 12 (H12; also called AF-2 helix) highlight the large flexibility of this region (7Renaud J.P. Moras D. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 2000; 57: 1748-1769Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar, 9Kallenberger B.C. Love J.D. Chatterjee V.K. Schwabe J.W. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2003; 10: 136-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). In holo-LBD, H12 is folded back on the core of the LBD, closing the LBP. This holo-position of H12 is stabilized by direct or indirect interactions with the ligand. The tightened position of H12, together with H3 and H4, results in the formation of a hydrophobic groove in which coactivator proteins can bind through a conserved LXXLL motif, forming an α-helix. The ligand-induced conformational change concomitantly leads to destruction of the surface that binds the corepressor, resulting in its release from the LBD. The conserved domains present in NRs allow relatively easy identification of nuclear receptors in genomic sequences (10Robinson-Rechavi M. Carpentier A.S. Duffraisse M. Laudet V. Trends Genet. 2001; 17: 554-556Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar) and also robust phylogenetic reconstruction on the scale of the superfamily (11Laudet V. Hänni C. Coll J. Catzeflis F. Stéhelin D. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 1003-1013Crossref PubMed Scopus (575) Google Scholar, 12Escriva H. Bertrand S. Laudet V. Essays Biochem. 2004; 40: 11-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Such analysis shows that NRs for similar ligands do not group in the tree but are interspersed with receptors for totally different ligands, whereas orphans are widely distributed in the tree. This observation has led to the proposal that the superfamily evolved from an orphan receptor that gained the capacity of ligand binding several times independently (13Escriva H. Safi R. Hänni C. Langlois M.C. Saumitou-Laprade P. Stehelin D. Capron A. Pierce R. Laudet V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 6803-6808Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar, 14Laudet V. J. Mol.

The case of retinoid receptors is interesting in that respect. Indeed, at least two distinct types of nuclear receptors, the RARs (α (NR1B1), β (NR1B2), and γ (NR1B3); activated by all-trans-retinoic acid (RA)) and the RXRs (α (NR2B1), β (NR2B2) and γ (NR2B3); activated by 9-cis-RA) apparently transduce the retinoid message (16Germain P. Staels B. Dacquet C. Spedding M. Laudet V. Pharmacol. Rev. 2006; 58: 685-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (467) Google Scholar, 17Germain P. Chambon P. Eichele G. Evans R.M. Lazar M.A. Leid M. De Lera A.R.

Lotan R. Mangelsdorf D.J. Gronemeyer H. Pharmacol. Rev. 2006; 58: 760-772Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar). It has thus been proposed that the capacity to bind, for example, retinoic acids, would have been acquired several times by mutation of an orphan nuclear receptor, allowing the establishment of nuclear retinoic acid signaling pathways (RARs and RXRs). The case of RXR and USP, its arthropod homologue, is especially interesting in that context, because this receptor plays a pivotal role inside the NR superfamily as a ubiquitous heterodimer partner for class II NRs (19Brelivet Y. Kammerer S. Rochel N. Poch O. Moras D. EMBO Rep. 2004; 5: 423-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). It is noteworthy that structural analysis can provide more insight into the evolution of a protein domain (e.g. through the comparative structural analysis of domains from animals located at critical positions in the evolutionary tree). In that respect, the study of RXR LBD is important, since RXR is an ancient gene that was subjected to several functional shifts during evolution. In addition, the status of RXR as a bona fide liganded receptor and the identity of its endogenous ligand are still under discussion (18Germain P. Chambon P. Eichele G. Evans R.M. Lazar M.A. Leid M.

Several experiments suggest that there is a very small amount of 9-cis-RA in vivo, casting doubts on its physiological relevance as an RXR ligand (21Mic F.A. Molotkov A. Benbrook D.M. Duester G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 7135-7140Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). In addition, it has been suggested, from in vivo detection of RXR-activating molecules, that docohexaneoic acid (DHA) could be a ligand for RXR (22de Urquiza A.M. Liu S. Sjöberg M. Zetterström R.H.

A large number of homologues of RXR have been identified in a variety of animals including early metazoans, such as sponges and cnidarians, but also arthropods, mollusks, and invertebrate chordates. In cnidarians, RXR was shown to bind 9-cis-RA (23Kostrouch Z. Kostrouchova M. Love W. Jannini E. Piatigorsky J. Rall J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 13442-13447Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar), and it activates transcription 7H. Escriva and V. Lauder, unpublished results. in response to it. In contrast, in insects, the orthologue of RXR, called USP, is unable to bind 9-cis-RA and experienced a very high evolutionary rate in dipterans and lepidopterans (see Ref. 24Bonneton F. Zelus D. Iwema T. Robinson-Rechavi M. Laudet V. Mol. Biol. Evol. 2003; 20: 541-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar and references therein). Detailed comparative structural analysis of USPs from insects have shown that these can be separated into two different types of receptors: (i) in basal insects, such as hemipterans and coleopterans, the USP ligand-binding pocket is partly filled by residues of unfolded H6 and H11 helices and is thus likely to be an orphan receptor; (ii) in mecopterida (a terminal group of insects that includes dipteras and lepidopteras among others), a phospholipid is present as a structural ligand inside the LBD that may be indicative of the existence of an endogenous ligand yet to be identified (28Iwema T. Billas I.M. Beck Y. Bonneton F. Nierengarten H. Chaumot A. Richards G. Laudet V. Moras D. EMBO J. 2007; 26: 3770-3782Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). In mollusks, RXR can be activated by 9-cis-RA and DHA, at least using transient transfection experiments (25de Groot A. de Rosny E. Juillan-Binard C. Ferrer J.L. Laudet V. Pierce R.J. Pebay-Peyroula E. Fontecilla-Camps J.C. Borel F. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 354: 841-853Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The case of amphioxus is especially interesting, since this species is clearly located in the lineage giving rise to vertebrates but before the complete genome duplications of vertebrates (26Schubert M. Escriva H. Xavier-Neto J. Laudet V. Trends Ecol. Evol. 2006; 21: 269-277Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar) (see Fig. 7 for a phylogenetic tree). Thus, AmphiRXR is closely related to the three vertebrate RXR genes but represents a nonduplicated version of these genes. Consequently, determining the structure of the LBD encoded by the unique amphioxus AmphiRXR gene and the comparison of this structure with its vertebrate orthologues will infer the main structural features of RXR in the common ancestor of vertebrates (i.e. before gene duplication events). In this paper, we report the crystal structure of the apo form AmphiRXR LBD, revealing a stable antagonist conformation not driven by either a fortuitous or an antagonist ligand.

Cloning and Purification—The cDNA coding for the Branchiostoma floridae RXR (accession number AF378829), AmphiRXR (35Escriva H. Holland N.D. Gronemeyer H. Laudet V. Holland L.Z. Development. 2002; 12: 2905-2916Google Scholar) ligand-binding domain (residues 266-484) was PCR-amplified from pSG5 vector and cloned by homologous recombination into the vector pET15b. The residue's position number given here corresponds to the AmphiRXR sequence with the corresponding human sequence numbers within parentheses, (HsAA-xxx), for some residues. The recombinant protein was overproduced and purified in two steps. Briefly, the LBD of AmphiRXR (residues 266-484) was cloned in pET15b expression vector to obtain an N-terminal hexahistidine-tagged fusion protein and was overproduced in Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3). Cells were grown in LB medium and subsequently induced for 6 h at 20 °C with 1 mm isopropyl thio-β-d-galactoside. Protein purification included a metal affinity chromatography step on a nickel-Hitrap column and a gel filtration on Superdex 75 16/60. The cell pellets were resuspended in binding buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 300 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 5 mm imidazole), lysed by sonication, and clarified by centrifugation. The cleared supernatant was loaded on a nickel-Hitrap column (GE Healthcare). The protein was eluted using 150 and 300 mm imidazole, pH 8.0. The protein was subjected to gel filtration on a Superdex 75 16/60 column (GE Healthcare) in 20 mm Tris, pH 8, 200 mm NaCl, and 5 mm dithiothreitol. The protein was then concentrated to 10 mg/ml using a 10K Centricon device. The purity and homogeneity of the protein were assessed by SDS-PAGE and native PAGE and electrospray ionization mass spectrometry. The protein is in equilibrium between homotetramer and homodimer according to analytical gel filtration and native PAGE. The homodimer dissociates into a monomer when characterized by mass spectrometry studies in 50 mm ammonium acetate. Transient Transfection Assays—293T cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 5% of charcoal-treated fetal calf serum. The cells were transfected at 70% confluence in 24-well plates using 4 μl of ExGen 500 (Euromedex) with 1.0 μg of total DNA, including 0.1 μg of reporter plasmid (17m)x5-tk-luc, and 10 ng of cytomegalovirus-β-galactosidase as an internal control to account for variations of transfection efficiency. The culture medium was changed 6 h after transfection, and when appropriate, ligands dissolved in EtOH were added to different final concentrations (10-9 to 10-6m). Cells were lysed 24 h after transfection and assayed for luciferase activity. For the test of TIF2 (transcriptional intermediary factor 2) action, 10-500 ng of TIF2 expression vector were assessed. Pull-down Assays—DNAs of TIF2.1 and TIF2.1m123, kindly provided by Hinrich Gronemeyer (36Voegel J.J. Heine M.J. Zechel C. Chambon P. Gronemeyer H. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3667-3675Crossref PubMed Scopus (953) Google Scholar), were both transcribed and translated in vitro using the TNT T7-coupled reticulocyte lysate system (Promega) following the instructions of the manufacturer. Batches of 50 μm Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose gel (Qiagen) washed and equilibrated in buffer A (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 5 mm imidazole, 10% glycerol, and 0.1% Nonidet P-40) were loaded with 2 μg of E. coli-purified His-tagged LBDs (HsRXRα or AmphiRXR). Incubation with TIF2.1 or TIF2.1m123 was done in a final volume of 50 μl of buffer A containing 2 μl of in vitro translated protein and 10 μg of bovine serum albumin and in the presence of 2 μm ligand or 1% of ethanol. After incubation for 1 h at 4 °C and three washing steps in buffer A, bound proteins were recovered with SDS sample buffer and revealed by autoradiography of 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. Electrospray Ionization Mass Spectrometry—Before mass analysis, amphioxus and human RXR LBDs purification buffers were exchanged against 50 mm ammonium acetate on two successive gel filtration columns (NAP-10; GE Healthcare) and then concentrated on Centricon 10-kDa devices. ESI-MS measurements were performed on an electrospray time-of-flight mass spectrometer (LCT; Waters, Manchester, UK). The mass measurements of the noncovalent complexes were performed in ammonium acetate (50 mm, pH 6.8). Samples were diluted to 20 μm and continuously infused into the ESI ion source at a flow rate of 6 μl/min through a Harvard syringe pump. Titration experiments were done by adding 2.5 mol eq of ligands to HsRXR or AmphiRXR, followed by a 15-min incubation at 4 °C. Competition experiments were performed by adding an equimolar mixture of two ligands (each in a 2.5-fold molar excess) to the protein, followed by a 15-min incubation. A 2.5-fold molar excess of ligand was used as a standard in our mass spectrometry experiments for two reasons: (i) to be able to detect ligands even with poor affinities (50-100 μm) and (ii) to assess the specificity of the binding (with a 2.5-fold molar excess, nonspecific binding would also lead to the appearance of bis-adducts, which could not be seen with only a 1:1 ratio). The ligands tested were synthetic (BMS649 and CD3254) or natural (DHA, 9-cis-RA, and oleic acid) agonist ligands of HsRXR. 9-cis-RA, all-trans-RA, oleic acid, and DHA were diluted in 10 mm EtOH. BMS649 and CD3254 were diluted in 10 mm EtOH/DMSO (90:10, v/v). To prevent dissociation in the gas phase during the ionization and desorption process, the cone voltage was optimized to 5 V. Mass data were acquired in the positive ion mode on the m/z 1000-5000 mass range. Calibration of the instrument was performed using the multiply charged ions produced by a separate injection of horse heart myoglobin diluted to 2 μm in 1:1 water/acetonitrile (v/v) acidified with 1% (v/v) formic acid. The relative abundance of the different species present on ESI mass spectra were measured from their respective peak heights (37Peschke M. Verkerk U.H. Kebarle P. J. Am. Soc. Mass Spectrom. 2004; 15: 1424-1434Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). All experiments were reproduced at least three times. An important feature concerning the noncovalent MS approach is whether ESI mass spectra obtained in nondenaturing conditions in the gas phase of the mass spectrometer faithfully reflect direct in solution binding. Several control experiments were performed in order to argue in favor of structurally specific interactions. A series of “successive in solution competitions” strongly argue in favor of site-specific interactions. Instead of the simultaneous addition of a mixture of two ligands, as realized in the direct in solution competitions, successive ligand addition was achieved; a first ligand, L1, is bound to the protein (formation of a 1:1 RXR·L1 complex), and a second one, L2, serves to displace the equilibrium toward the formation of the RXR·L2 complex. Such experiments allow us to unambiguously assess that both ligands compete for the same binding site and that ESI-MS-observed interactions do not result from any artifactual gas phase aggregation. Finally, experiments with different binding partners (either different ligands or human versus amphioxus proteins) were also performed, leading to subsequent changes on ESI mass spectra. Structure Determination—The homodimeric protein fractions were used for crystallization trials. The purified protein conditioned in 20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 200 mm NaCl, 5 mm dithiothreitol and concentrated to 5 mg/ml. Crystals were grown by the hanging drop diffusion method and appeared in 4 days at 17 °C. The initial drop contained 5 mg/ml protein, 1.5 m sodium acetate, 50 mm N-(2-acetamido)iminodiacetic acid, pH 6.5, and was equilibrated versus a reservoir containing 1.8 m sodium acetate, 100 mm N-(2-acetamido)iminodiacetic acid, pH 6.5. Two different crystals forms, hexagonal and orthorhombic, were obtained in the same crystallization conditions. Only the orthorhombic form resulted in being suitable for structural determination. The solvent content of the crystals is 52.2% with two LBD dimers (homotetramer) per asymmetric unit. Thus, the homodimeric protein may reassociate with time and salt concentration of the precipitant agent. Crystals were flash cooled in ethane after cryoprotection in a solution containing the reservoir solution plus 25% glycerol. A 2.7 Å resolution data set was obtained merging high and low resolution data sets from only one crystal at the BM29 Synchrotron line of the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility facility in Grenoble. Data were integrated and scaled using the DENZO-SCALEPACK package (38Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38617) Google Scholar). The program CNS-SOLVE was used throughout the structure determination and refinement calculations (39Brünger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16979) Google Scholar). An initial phase estimate was obtained by molecular replacement using a partial structure of HsRXR dimer. After a rigid body refinement, the solution resulted in Rcryst of 34% and Rfree of 35%. The model obtained was used to determine the NCS matrix of the four monomer molecules in the asymmetric unit in order to include averaging and solvent flattening procedure of density modification to calculate a first electron density map. The map unequivocally showed the missing parts of the model and allowed the complete manual building of the structure. The phase bias of the initial model was reduced by torsion angle molecular dynamics simulated annealing refinement. Subsequent refinement cycles alternated least square minimization and model building using the program O (40Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13014) Google Scholar). The NCS was constrained in the first round of refinement and subsequently restrained and released. B factors were refined using two groups per residue. In the last cycle, 27 water molecules were located from a difference Fourier map. The loop between H1 and H3 (residues 281-289) and the lateral chains of the residues at positions 271-274, 299, 478, and 482-484 could not be constructed because of poor electron density. The quality of the final model quality was assessed with Procheck. Because of the absence of electron density for the loop between H1 and H3, the integrity of the protein in the crystals was checked by SDS-PAGE (data not shown). For the structure comparison, Cα traces of the models were superimposed using the lsq commands of O and default parameters. The figures were generated with Pymol. Crystallographic data and refinement statistics are summarized in supplemental Table 1. The chemical structures of all of the ligands described in this paper are shown in supplemental Fig. 1. Residues That Contact 9-cis-Retinoic Acid Are All Conserved between AmphiRXR and HsRXR—Previous phylogenetical analysis clearly shows that, as expected, the amphioxus RXR sequence is positioned before the duplications giving rise to the three vertebrate genes (35Escriva H. Holland N.D. Gronemeyer H. Laudet V. Holland L.Z. Development. 2002; 12: 2905-2916Google Scholar) (supplemental Fig. 2). In addition, amphioxus RXR was shown to heterodimerize with amphioxus retinoic acid nuclear recepter or thyroid nuclear receptor and to bind to the relevant direct repeat sequence (41Escriva H.

Biol. 2008; 18: 825-830Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). To determine the crystal structure of the ligand-binding domain we selected a region that encompasses residues 266-484, leaving out the last 30 amino acid of the molecule that form an F-domain with no sequence identity with other NRs. Fig. 1 represents the structure-based sequence alignment of RXR LBDs from different organisms. The alignment reveals a high degree of sequence identity except for the length and composition of the loop between H1 and H3. Based on the structure of human RXRα, the residues that contact the 9-cis-RA are all conserved. The ability to bind this ligand seems thus to be preserved, and this is supported by mass spectrometry studies as well as by transient transfection assays (see below). The same degree of conservation is encountered also in the residues that form the hydrophobic groove in contact with the LXXLL motif activator helix (43Egea P.F. Mitschler A. Moras D. Mol Endocrinol. 2002; 16: 987-997Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). The only exception is a Val residue that in amphioxus RXR substitutes at position 306 a Phe, forming Van der Waals contacts with the coactivator helix. The amino acids of the dimerization interface are strictly conserved (19Brelivet Y."

To characterize the interplay of these forces in an important pathogen, we sequenced the rlrA islet, a chromosomal region encoding for a pilus-like structure involved in adherence to lung epithelial cells in vitro and in colonization in a murine model of infection, in 44 clinical isolates of Streptococcus pneumoniae.We found that the rrgA and rrgB genes, encoding the main structural components of the pilus, are under the action of positive selection. In contrast, the rrgC gene, coding for a component present in low quantities in the assembled pilus, and the srtB, srtC and srtD genes, coding for three sortase enzymes essential for pilus assembly but probably not directly exposed to the host immune system, show no evidence of positive selection. We found several events of homologous recombination in the region containing these genes, identifying 4 major recombination hotspots. An analysis of the most recent recombination events shows a high level of mosaicism of the region coding for the rrgC, srtB, srtC and srtD genes.In the rlrA islet, the genes coding for proteins directly exposed to the host immune response are under the action of positive selection, and exist in distinct forms in the population of circulating strains. The genes coding for proteins not directly exposed on the surface of the bacterial cell are more conserved probably due to the homogenizing effect of recombination."

We concluded that a link in the respiratory chain between glutamate and cytochrome b required phosphate even in the presence of dinitrophenol, a conclusion which seemed to have important implications for theories of the mechanism of the uncoupling of oxidative phosphorylation by dinitrophenol."

https://openalex.org/W2000367271,"Transcriptional networks are constituted by a collection of building blocks known as network motifs. Why do motifs appear? An adaptive model of motif emergence was recently questioned in favor of neutralist scenarios. Here, we provide a new picture of motif assembly in Escherichia coli which partially clarifies these contrasting explanations. This is based on characterizing the linkage between motifs and sensing or response specificity of their constituent transcriptional factors (TFs). We find that sensing specificity influences the distribution of autoregulation, while the tendency of a TF to establish feed-forward loops (FFLs) depends on response specificity, i.e., regulon size. Analysis of the latter pattern reveals that coregulation between large regulon-size TFs is common under a network neutral model, leading to the assembly of a great number of FFLs and bifans. In addition, neutral exclusive regulation also leads to a collection of single input modules -the fourth basic motif. On the whole, and even under the conservative neutralist scenario considered, a substantial group of regulatory structures revealed adaptive. These structures visibly function as fully-fledged working units."

Biochem. 2007; 365: 52-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Recently, we have solved the tetrameric ring-like structure of BsRibG (10Chen S.C. Chang Y.C. Lin C.H. Lin C.H. Liaw S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 7605-7613Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The D domain belongs to the cytidine deaminase superfamily, in which the members catalyze the hydrolytic deamination of the base moiety of a variety of nucleotides including RNA, DNA, mononucleotides, and several therapeutically useful analogues (11Conticello S.G. Genome Biol. 2008; 9: 229-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar). Despite no significant sequence similarity, the R domain is the only protein so far to share high structural homology with dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR). DHFR catalyzes the reduction of dihydrofolate into tetrahydrofolate, and many inhibitors of this enzyme have long been used clinically for the treatment of cancer, inflammation, and microbial infection (12Hawser S. Lociuro S. Islam K. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2006; 71: 941-948Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar, 13Gangjee A. Jain H.D. Kurup S. Anticancer Agents Med. Chem. 2008; 8: 205-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The reduction mechanism of the ribose ring into a ribityl group is still inconclusive. Accumulation of an Amadori derivative in riboflavin-requiring B. subtilis mutants suggested that in bacteria, the reaction involves an Amadori rearrangement initiated by proton abstraction from C2′, followed by reduction of the C2′ carbonyl group (14Bresler S.E. Glazunov E.A. Perumov D.A. Chernik T.P. Genetika. 1977; 13: 2006-2016PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, feeding experiments using deuterium incorporation in the yeast Ashbya gossypii, suggested that the reduction occurs by hydride transfer to C1′, ruling out an Amadori mechanism (15Keller P.J. Le Van Q. Kim S.U. Bown D.H. Chen H.C. Kohnle A. Bacher A. Floss H.G. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 1117-1120Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Recently, kinetic isotope studies of Escherichia coli RibD suggested a direct hydride transfer from the C4-pro-R hydrogen of NADPH to C1′, and that this is the rate-limiting step in the overall deamination-reduction reaction (16Magalhães M.L. Argyrou A. Cahill S.M. Blanchard J.S. Biochemistry. 2008; 47: 6499-6507Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). To gain structural insights into the substrate specificity, catalytic mechanisms, and inhibitor design, we have determined the structure of BsRibG as a complex with AROPP at 2.56-Å resolution. Together with the previous NADPH complex structure (10Chen S.C. Chang Y.C. Lin C.H. Lin C.H. Liaw S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 7605-7613Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), a reduction mechanism is proposed. In the D domain, mutational analysis of the predicted substrate binding residues was also carried out. Preparation of Protein and Substrates—Site-directed mutagenesis was carried out using a QuikChange mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). Protein expression, purification, enzyme activity assay, and crystallization of the N-terminally His-tagged recombinant BsRibG were performed as previously described (10Chen S.C. Chang Y.C. Lin C.H. Lin C.H. Liaw S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 7605-7613Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The E51A mutant and wild-type crystals were grown in 28% polyethylene glycol 400, 200 mm CaCl2, and 100 mm HEPES (pH 7.5) with a protein concentration of 20–25 mg/ml. The DAROPP compound was prepared from a reaction solution containing 5 mg/ml of recombinant E. coli cyclohydrolase II, 10–30 mm GTP, 8 mm MgCl2, and 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0). The reaction was complete at around 10 min, and then 2 mg of BsRibG was added for production of AROPP. The reactions were monitored by UV absorption spectra recorded on a Beckman DU640B spectrophotometer. Activity Assay—For measurement of the relative deaminase activity of the mutants, 20 μg BsRibG was incubated into the 1-ml reaction solution containing 0.1 m Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm dithiothreitol, and ∼0.2 mm DAROPP for 20 min at room temperature. The deaminase activity was measured by monitoring change in absorbance at 292 nm. For the reductase assay, after the deamination was complete, 1 mm NADPH was added into the reaction mixture for 15–60 min at 37 °C. Diacetyl was added with a final concentration of 1% (v/v), and the mixture was incubated at 95 °C for 30 min. After centrifugation to remove protein precipitant, the fluorescence spectrum was recorded with an excitation wavelength of 408 nm. The relative reductase activity was estimated by the emission intensity at 485 nm. Structure Determination—The reaction solution was added to the crystal drops for 30–60 min with a final concentration of ∼10–15 mm DAROPP or AROPP. X-ray diffraction data from several crystals between 2.56–2.68 Å resolution were collected and processed at the beamlines BL13B1 at NSRRC (Hsinchu, Taiwan), and NW12 at the Photon Factory (Tsukuba, Japan). The crystals belong to the P212121space group with one tetramer per asymmetric unit. The complex structure was determined using the molecular replacement method and refined using CNS (17Brünger A.T.

B, stereo view of the R domain superposition of BsRibG (red), EcRibD (green), and TmRibG (blue). Four distinct conformations were observed for LβA-αB and LβF-βG in the available EcRibD structures (28Stenmark P. Moche M. Gurmu D. Nordlund P. J. Mol.

In the apo structure, crystal contacts may result in the observed LβA-αBB conformation (yellow), and hence affect LβF-βGB (yellow) even LβF-βGA and LβA-αBA (magenta). Both LβA-αBA and LβF-βGA are quite mobile, and several residues (164–166 and 339–345) are even disordered. The NADP+ binding induced LβA-αBA to move toward the cofactor (green); there is a consequent shifting of LβF-βGA with residues 338–346 disordered (green), and of LβF-βGB and LβA-αBB with residues 162–169 disordered (cyan).

The NADPH and the ribitylimino intermediate in BsRibG are colored in magenta, while the NADP+ and the folate in EcDHFR are in cyan. Interestingly, even though their substrates are very distinct, both reductases share a virtually identical geometry for the pro-R hydride transfer, with the reactive carbon atoms highlighted in black.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Substrate Preparation—Production of DAROPP and AROPP was monitored by UV-VIS absorption spectra because the distinct nucleobases of GTP, DAROPP and AROPP result in different spectra with different maximum wavelengths of 254, 293, and 284 nm, respectively. The DAROPP concentration was estimated using an absorption coefficient ϵ293 of 9600 m–1 cm-1 (20Dietrich R. Bencovic S.S. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1979; 101: 6144-6145Crossref Scopus (4) Google Scholar, 21Ritz H. Schramek N. Bracher A. Herz S. Eisenreich W. Richter G. Bacher A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 22273-22277Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), because GTP has hardly any absorption at this wavelength. The yields were consistent with previous studies, in which DAROPP formation accounts for ∼90% of the E. coli cyclohydrolase II products (21Ritz H. Schramek N. Bracher A. Herz S. Eisenreich W. Richter G. Bacher A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 22273-22277Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The AROPP concentration was estimated using NADPH consumption catalyzed by the R domain in term of the decrease in absorbance at 340 nm. The D domain of BsRibG produces AROPP as its main product at >80% of total conversion. In the absence of dithiothreitol, the reaction solution gradually turned yellow in a couple of hours with the maximum wavelength shifted from 284 to 245 nm and with a shoulder at 270 nm. Addition of 30 mm dithiothreitol into the reaction solution prevented the formation of the yellow color and the shift of the UV spectra. Mutational Analysis in the D Domain—Asn23 and His42, His76 and Lys79, and Asp101 and Asn103 were previously predicted to interact with the pyrimidine, phosphate and ribose of the substrate DAROPP, respectively (10Chen S.C. Chang Y.C. Lin C.H. Lin C.H. Liaw S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 7605-7613Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). These six residues as well as the invariant glutamate in the family signature HXE, were substituted with alanine. No detectable deaminase activity was observed in the E51A and K79A mutants, whereas the other five mutants showed a decreased relative activity by 2–3-fold compared with the wild-type enzyme. As with other family members (22Xiang S. Short S.A. Wolfenden R. Carter Jr., C.W. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 4768-4774Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 23Ko T.P. Lin J.J. Hu C.Y. Hsu Y.H.

Chem. 2007; 282: 37103-37111Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), the invariant glutamate in BsRibG, Glu51, may be also involved in the proton shuttle during the deamination process (Fig. 1), and hence substitution with alanine eliminates the deaminase activity. Previous studies showed that the dephosphorylated form cannot serve as a substrate (27Burrows R.B. Brown G.M. J. Bacteriol. 1978; 136: 657-667Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus as predicted, Lys79 may interact with the phosphate group and such interactions would seem to be essential for the deaminase activity. In addition, in the soaking experiments, neither did AROPP bind to the D domain of the wild-type BsRibG, nor did DAROPP bind to the E51A mutant. In these crystal structures, the RibG unique loop containing His76 and Lys79 is flexible and swings away from the active site, and hence a substrate binding cavity may not be fully formed. The Substrate Binding Site in the R Domain—BsRibG exists as a tetramer in solution (10Chen S.C. Chang Y.C. Lin C.H. Lin C.H. Liaw S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 7605-7613Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The four subunits (Molecules A-D) in the crystal asymmetric unit form a ring-like tetramer (Fig. 2). Significant strong electron density for the ligand was observed only in the R domain of Molecule C. The substrate AROPP was initially modeled into the electron density, but the pyrimidine and the phosphate groups could not be modeled simultaneously into their respective electron dense areas (Fig. 3A). In addition, the carboxyl group of Glu290 would seem to form unfavorable interactions with the ribosyl O4′, and the ribosyl geometry is distorted during the structure refinement. Feeding experiments with A. gossypii suggested that the reduction occurs at C1′, and the authors proposed a formation of a Schiff base intermediate (15Keller P.J. Le Van Q. Kim S.U. Bown D.H. Chen H.C. Kohnle A. Bacher A. Floss H.G. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 1117-1120Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Interestingly, this proposed ribitylimino intermediate could be modeled nicely into the electron density (Fig. 3A) and forms more extensive interactions with the R domain than the substrate AROPP. The pyrimidine O2 interacts with Lys151 Nζ, the NH3 group with Thr171 Oγ1, the O4 with Ile170 N and Thr171 N, and the NH25 with Ser167 Oδ1 (Fig. 3B). The two ribosyl hydroxyl groups, OH2′ and OH3′, have close contacts with Asp199 Oδ2, while OH4′ with Glu290 Oϵ2. And the phosphate forms an extensive interaction network with Arg183 Nη1, Ser202 N, Leu203 N, and Arg206 Nη2. Superposition of the four R domains in the tetramer showed multiple conformations that covered two regions, residues 167–171 and 202–212 (Fig. 3C). In Molecule C, upon AROPP binding, residues 167–171 and 202–212 moved a small amount to allow interaction with the pyrimidine ring and the phosphate group, respectively, particularly, the backbones of Ser167, Ile170, Thr171, Ser202, and Leu203. Similarly, when 10 mm NADPH was added into the BsRibG crystals for 4 days, strong density was also detected only in the R domain of Molecule C (10Chen S.C. Chang Y.C. Lin C.H. Lin C.H. Liaw S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 7605-7613Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Upon NADPH binding, residues 156–170 moved toward the cofactor and hence some conformational changes were induced, particularly affecting the backbones of Leu160 and Gly165. The backbones of residues 193–195 also shifted toward the pyrophosphate of the cofactor. Structure Comparison within RibG, and Rib7—Several other crystal structures of R domain homologs have also been determined: E. coli RibD (EcRibD, PDB 2G6V for apo; 2OBC for binary ribose 5-phosphate; and 2O7P for binary NADP+) (28Stenmark P. Moche M. Gurmu D. Nordlund P. J. Mol. Biol. 2007; 373: 49-64Crossref Scopus (20) Google Scholar), Thermotoga maritima RibG (TmRibG, PDB 2HXV for binary NADPH), Methanocaldococcus jannaschii Rib7 (MjRib7, PDB 2AZN for binary NADPH) (29Chatwell L. Krojer T. Fidler A. Eisenreich W. Bacher A. Huber R. Fischer M. J. Mol. Biol. 2006; 359: 1334-1351Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) and the putative Rib7 from Corynebacterium diphtheriae (PDB 2P4G). The R domains and Rib7s as well as DHFR, share diverse loop conformations but a virtually identical structure core including the central eight β-strands (βA-βH) and the four flanking helices (αB, αC, αE, and αF), with the secondary elements numbered as found in DHFR (30Schnell J.R. Dyson H.J. Wright P.E. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 2004; 33: 119-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar) (Fig. 4). The N-terminal half constitutes the majority of the active site and hence is more conserved with a sequence identity of 30–50%, whereas the C-terminal half is more diverse, with 15–30% identity (Fig. 4A). The most diverse region is the RibG/Rib7-unique insertion between the βD and αE, which has various lengths and a low sequence homology. This insertion forms a helix (αD′) and a β-strand (βD′) in BsRibG and MjRib7, but it is only a strand and a long loop in TmRibG and EcRibD (Fig. 4B). The second diverse section is the C-terminal tail including the βG and βH strands and LβF-βG, which together with the first loop, LβA-αB, and the βF strand, constitute the R-R interfaces. Thus the diverse C-terminal half of the molecule results in the distinct R-R interfaces, and may contribute to the different oligomerization states, a tetramer with BsRibG but a dimer with EcRibD and TmRibG. Comparison of the Cofactor and Substrate Binding—A detailed comparison of the complex structures revealed that their cofactor adenosine-2′-phosphate moieties occupy distinct spatial positions and interact with different residues, for example Thr221 and Ser298 in BsRibG (10Chen S.C. Chang Y.C. Lin C.H. Lin C.H. Liaw S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 7605-7613Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), Ser194, Ser234, Arg237, and His278 in EcRibD (28Stenmark P. Moche M. Gurmu D. Nordlund P. J. Mol. Biol. 2007; 373: 49-64Crossref Scopus (20) Google Scholar), Arg221, Lys285, and Glu289 in TmRibG and Ser83, Lys84, Arg86, Val134 in MjRib7 (29Chatwell L. Krojer T. Fidler A. Eisenreich W. Bacher A. Huber R. Fischer M. J. Mol. Biol. 2006; 359: 1334-1351Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) (Fig. 4C). In contrast, the remaining parts of the NADPH cofactor occupy similar spatial positions and form similar interaction networks, particularly with the protein backbones. The binding architectures of the reactive nicotinamide rings in BsRibG, TmRibG, and MjRib7, and even in the DHFRs, are virtually identical. Superposition of the AROPP intermediate in BsRibG against the ribose 5-phosphate in EcRibD reveals that the phosphate groups occupy a similar position and form virtually identical interactions with two conserved arginines and two backbone NHs (Fig. 4C). However, the sugar moieties point in opposite directions and hence distinct residues have been proposed to be involved in the proton transfer, namely Asp200 in EcRibD (28Stenmark P. Moche M. Gurmu D. Nordlund P. J. Mol. Biol. 2007; 373: 49-64Crossref Scopus (20) Google Scholar) and Glu290 in BsRibG. Ribose-5-phosphate may not be a suitable substrate analogue because it cannot mimic substrate binding due to the lack of the molecule pyrimidine ring and a ribitylimino intermediate. Moreover, the substrate AROPP could not be docked into the current EcRibD crystal structures (28Stenmark P. Moche M. Gurmu D. Nordlund P. J. Mol. Biol. 2007; 373: 49-64Crossref Scopus (20) Google Scholar), because the active site cavity is partially blocked by LβA-αB and hence there is no space to accommodate the pyrimidine ring (Fig. 4B). The observed multiple “inactive” conformations of EcRibD may be due to the crystal packing effects. Unlike BsRibG and TmRibG, Molecules A and B in the dimeric EcRibD display very distinct conformations for LβA-αB (residues 159–173) and LβF-βG (residues 322–348) (Fig. 4B). These two loops form several hydrogen bonds and constitute a major part of the R-R interfaces. In Molecule B, residues 174–177 make several direct contacts with residues 258–260 of symmetry-related Molecule A. These crystal contacts may result in the observed LβA-αB conformation in Molecule B (LβA-αBB), and hence affect the LβF-βGB conformation and thence the R-R interfaces, even LβF-βGA and LβA-αBA. The R-R interface in EcRibD is much less extensive than those present in BsRibG and TmRibG, with the buried areas of ∼2600 Å2 versus ∼4000 Å2 and ∼3800 Å2, respectively, calculated by the PISA server (31Krissinel E. Henrick K. J. Mol. Biol. 2007; 372: 774-797Crossref PubMed Scopus (6684) Google Scholar). When NADP+ was soaked into the EcRibD crystal, the cofactor binding induced LβA-αBA to move toward the cofactor allowing interaction with the nicotinamide moiety via Thr161, Ala164, and Trp170 (Fig. 4B); this consequently caused conformational shifts of LβF-βGA, LβF-βGB, and LβA-αBB. In BsRibG, only subtle structural shifts in LβA-αB were observed on binding of AROPP and NADPH. Furthermore, the current MjRib7 structure is also affected by crystal packing; MjRib7 exists as a dimer in solution, whereas a trimer is observed in the crystal (29Chatwell L. Krojer T. Fidler A. Eisenreich W. Bacher A. Huber R. Fischer M. J. Mol. Biol. 2006; 359: 1334-1351Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Substrate Specificity—During riboflavin biosynthesis, the deamination and reduction steps proceed in the opposite order when eubacteria and yeast are compared. Their substrates are distinct (Fig. 1), namely DAROPP with a cyclic ribose binding the D domain of RibGs versus DARIPP with a linear ribitol binding yeast Rib2; this has lead to the two deaminases evolving different residues for substrate recognition (10Chen S.C. Chang Y.C. Lin C.H. Lin C.H. Liaw S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 7605-7613Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). In contrast, the reductase substrates, AROPP for the R domain and DAROPP for Rib7, display similar structures with the only difference being a carbonyl versus an amino group; in this case, these two reductases share several conserved residues for substrate binding (Fig. 4A). Particularly, Thr171 (or Ser), Arg183, Asp199, Arg206, and Glu290 in BsRibG are all conserved across plants, eubacteria, archea, and fungi, indicating that RibG and Rib7 share a similar reduction mechanism through the ribitylimino intermediate. However, the R domain has to discriminate the deaminase product AROPP from the substrate DAROPP. The complex structure here clearly demonstrates that an invariant lysine (Lys151) in eubacteria and plants but not in fungi and archaea, has evolved to ensure substrate specificity through favorable interactions of its amino side chain with the AROPP O2, and unfavorable interactions with the DAROPP NH22 (Fig. 3B). Furthermore, MjRib7 can only recognize DAROPP but not AROPP as substrate (6Graupner M. Xu H. White R.H. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 1952-1957Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Based on the structural comparison described above, DAROPP was modeled into the active site of MjRib7. This predicted complex structure revealed a short distance of ∼3 Å between Asp37 Oδ2 and the NH 22, suggesting that this aspartate residue, conserved in archaea but not fungi, may be responsible for the substrate recognition. Further mutational analyses are under way. A Similar Substrate Binding Architecture in RibG and DHFR— The R domain and DHFR share high homology not only in core structure but also in active-site architecture. Even the R-R structure is similar to that of the dimeric DHFR from T. maritima (TmDHFR) (32Dams T. Auerbach G. Bader G. Jacob U. Ploom T. Huber R. Jaenicke R. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 297: 659-672Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), due to the presence of similar regions for subunit association. In addition to the four conserved regions for NADPH binding, interestingly, even though their substrates are very distinct, AROPP versus dihydrofolate, the binding residues for the individual parts are located in similar spatial positions (Fig. 4A). The residues responsible for the nucleobase are located between the βA strand and the αB helix, for example, Lys151 and residues 167–171 for the pyrimidine ring in BsRibG are comparable to Ile5, Met20, Asp27, Phe31 and Ile94 for the 6-methylpterin in the E. coli DHFR (EcDHFR) ternary complex with folate and NADP+ (PDB7DFR) (33Bystroff C.

Residues for the middle part are located at the C terminus of the αC helix; these are Asp199 for the ribitol in BsRibG and Ile50 for the p-aminobenzoate in EcDHFR. Interestingly, both reductases possess a positively charged groove for neutralization of the negatively charged group of the substrate: Two or three conserved arginines (or lysine) located at αB and LαC-βC, Arg183 and Arg206 in BsRibG and Arg32, Arg53, and Arg58 in EcDHFR, form salt bridges with the phosphate group and the glutamyl carboxylate moiety, respectively. These salt bridge interactions are essential for the reduction activity because BsRibG cannot utilize the dephosphorylated form as substrate (27Burrows R.B. Brown G.M. J. Bacteriol. 1978; 136: 657-667Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The Reduction Mechanism in RibG—For BsRibG, the substrate and cofactor binary complex structures were superimposed to mimic the ternary complex to obtain a geometry estimation of hydride transfer (Fig. 5). This ternary complex was then compared with those in the DHFRs where the enzymatic mechanism has been chemically and structurally studied in detail (30Schnell J.R. Dyson H.J. Wright P.E. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 2004; 33: 119-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar). In addition to the virtually identical binding of the cofactor nicotinamide ring, surprisingly, the reactive carbon atoms of the different substrates occupy a similar position and share a virtually identical orientation toward the nicotinamide C4 (Fig. 5). In BsRibG, the pyrimidine is parallel to the nicotinamide ring with a distance of 3.3 Å between the C4 donor and the C1′ acceptor with a N1′-C4-C1′ angle of 115 degrees. The corresponding distance and angle are 3.3 Å and 114 degrees for the EcDHFR ternary complex (33Bystroff C. Oatley S.J. Kraut J. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 3263-3277Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar), and 3.2 Å and 116 degrees in the DHFR complex from Pneumocystis carinii (34Cody V. Galitsky N. Rak D. Luft J.R. Pangborn W. Queener S.F. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 4303-4312Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Therefore, as well as DHFR, RibG would seem to catalyze the ribosyl reduction by C4-pro-R hydride transfer from NAD(P)H to the C1′, which is consist with the isotope studies (16Magalhães M.L. Argyrou A. Cahill S.M. Blanchard J.S. Biochemistry. 2008; 47: 6499-6507Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). On the basis of the previous studies on DHFR and the complex BsRibG structures described above, a reduction mechanism for the R domain can be proposed as outlined in Fig. 1. The closest ionizable residue in the vicinity of the NH1′ group of AROPP is the strictly conserved Glu290, with a distance of ∼4.6 Å between N1′ and Glu290Oϵ1. A water molecule could be placed to mediate hydrogen bonds between Glu290 and the NH1′ group, and thereby together with Glu290, may assist in proton transfer, abstracting a proton from the NH1′ group on the one hand and on the other hand, protonating the O4′ to yield the ribitylimino intermediate. In addition, Glu290 would seem to repel the ribose because of a short distance between its carboxyl group and the ribosyl O4′ (∼3 Å), and hence may facilitate the formation of the Schiff base intermediate. Analogous with the DHFR reaction, formation of the product ARIPP occurs by hydride transfer of the nicotinamide H4′ to the C1′ of the intermediate and protonation of the N1′ by a water molecule. The strong conservation between the R domain and DHFR suggests that these two reductases involved in riboflavin and folate biosyntheses might have evolved by gene duplication with conservation of the core structure, catalytic mechanism, and cofactor binding, but with subsequent divergence in which the substrate binding residues were changed, although with some aspects of their recognition properties being retained."
https://openalex.org/W2096093847,"Background Atherosclerosis is a common multifactorial disease resulting from an interaction between susceptibility genes and environmental factors. The causative genes that contribute to atherosclerosis are elusive. Based on recent findings with a Wistar rat model, we speculated that the γ-secretase pathway may be associated with atherosclerosis. Methodology/Principal Findings We have tested for association of premature coronary atherosclerosis with a non-synonymous single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the γ-secretase component APH1B (Phe217Leu; rs1047552), a SNP previously linked to Alzheimer's disease. Analysis of a Dutch Caucasian cohort (780 cases; 1414 controls) showed a higher prevalence of the risk allele in the patients (odds ratio (OR) = 1.35), albeit not statistically different from the control population. Intriguingly, after gender stratification, the difference was significant in males (OR = 1.63; p = 0.033), but not in females (OR = 0.50; p = 0.20). Since Phe217Leu-mutated APH1B showed reduced γ-secretase activity in mouse embryonic fibroblasts, the genetic variation is likely functional. Conclusion/Significance We conclude that, in a male-specific manner, disturbed γ-secretase signalling may play a role in the susceptibility for premature coronary atherosclerosis."

https://openalex.org/W1980279004,"THE secretion of aldosterone differs from that of other steroids of the adrenal cortex in that it is not directly under pituitary control. Current concepts favour a location in the diencephalon for the centre which controls aldosterone secretion1. The transmission of the stimulus from the centre to the effector gland cannot be nervous, since the isolated gland can respond to suitable provocations by an increased secretion of aldosterone2. It is therefore concluded that the stimulus is humoral."
https://openalex.org/W2001418826,"IT is a well-known fact that while our vision is binocular, one eye (more often the right than the left) is in fact preferred or dominant in fixation and sighting. Much has been published on this subject, especially in its relation to handedness. We conjectured that if one eye is dominant in sighting, the other, that is, the non-dominant eye, would logically be expected to close more easily in order to enhance the use of the dominant eye, and as a corollary, the dominant eye would be more resistant to closure unilaterally because of the very nature of its dominance. In putting this theory to test, we used the students of our senior and junior anatomy classes (total 145, ranging from 18 to 24) as subjects. Eye dominance was first ascertained by three or more trials of the cone test in each case, and then the subjects were asked to close the right and left eyes singly and alternately for a number of times and to say which eye they found could close with less effort. This latter test was subjective; in some cases, however, we were able to see quite plainly for ourselves. The results of our investigation are given in Table 1."
