https://openalex.org/W1977394169,"Neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) is concentrated at synaptic junctions in brain and motor endplates in skeletal muscle. Here, we show that the N-terminus of nNOS, which contains a PDZ protein motif, interacts with similar motifs in postsynaptic density-95 protein (PSD-95) and a related novel protein, PSD-93.nNOS and PSD-95 are coexpressed in numerous neuronal populations, and a PSD-95/nNOS complex occurs in cerebellum. PDZ domain interactions also mediate binding of nNOS to skeletal muscle syntrophin, a dystrophin-associated protein. nNOS isoforms lacking a PDZ domain, identified in nNOSdelta/delta mutant mice, do not associate with PSD-95 in brain or with skeletal muscle sarcolemma. Interaction of PDZ-containing domains therefore mediates synaptic association of nNOS and may play a more general role in formation of macromolecular signaling complexes."
https://openalex.org/W2117313136,"Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) down-regulates expression of MHC class I products by selective proteolysis. A single HCMV gene, US11, which encodes an endoplasmic reticulum (ER) resident type-I transmembrane glycoprotein, is sufficient to cause this effect. In US11+cells, MHC class I molecules are core-glycosylated and therefore inserted into the ER. They are degraded with a half-time of less than 1 min. A full length breakdown intermediate that has lost the single N-linked glycan in an N-glycanase-catalyzed reaction transiently accumulates in cells exposed to the protease inhibitors LLnL, Cbz-LLL, and lactacystin, identifying the proteasome as a key protease. Subcellular fractionation experiments show this intermediate to be cytosolic. Thus, US11 dislocates newly synthesized class I molecules from the ER to the cytosol, where they are acted upon by an N-glycanase and the proteasome."
https://openalex.org/W2078384542,"The Rho family of GTPases control diverse biological processes, including cell morphology and mitogenesis. We have identified WASP, the protein that is defective in Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome (WAS), as a novel effector for CDC42Hs, but not for the other Rho family members, Rac and Rho. This interaction is dependent on the presence of the G protein-binding domain. Cellular expression of epitope-tagged WASP produces clusters of WASP that are highly enriched in polymerized actin. This clustering is not observed with a C-terminally deleted WASP and is inhibited by coexpression with dominant negative CDC42Hs-N17, but not with dominant negative forms of Rac or Rho. Thus, WASP provides a novel link between CDC42Hs and the actin cytoskeleton, which suggests a molecular mechanism for many of the cellular abnormalities in WAS. The WASP sequence contains two novel domains that are homologous to other proteins involved in action organization."
https://openalex.org/W1969155399,"NMDA (N-methyl-D-aspartate) receptors are excitatory neurotransmitter receptors in the brain critical for synaptic plasticity and neuronal development. These receptors are Ca2+-permeable glutamate-gated ion channels whose physiological properties are regulated by intracellular Ca2+. We report here the purification of a 20 kDa protein identified as calmodulin that interacts with the NR1 subunit of the NMDA receptor. Calmodulin binding to the NR1 subunit is Ca2+ dependent and occurs with homomeric NR1 complexes, heteromeric NR1/NR2 subunit complexes, and NMDA receptors from brain. Furthermore, calmodulin binding to NR1 causes a 4-fold reduction in NMDA channel open probability. These results demonstrate that NMDA receptor function can be regulated by direct binding of calmodulin to the NR1 subunit, and suggest a possible mechanism for activity-dependent feedback inhibition and Ca2+-dependent inactivation of NMDA receptors."
https://openalex.org/W1975635900,"Circadian behavioral rhythms in Drosophila depend on the appropriate regulation of at least two genes, period (per) and timeless (tim). Previous studies demonstrated that levels of PER and TIM RNA cycle with the same phase and that the PER and TIM proteins interact directly. Here we show the cyclic expression of TIM protein in adult heads and report that it lags behind peak levels of TIM RNA by several hours. We also show that nuclear expression of TIM depends upon the expression of PER protein. Finally, we report that the expression of TIM, but not PER, is rapidly reduced by light, suggesting that TIM mediates light-induced resetting of the circadian clock. Since both PER and TIM RNA are unaffected by light treatment, the effects of light on TIM appear to be posttranscriptional."
https://openalex.org/W2059353637,"The most distinctive morphogenetic feature of leaves is their being either simple or compound. To study the basis for this dichotomy, we have exploited the maize homeobox-containing Knotted-1 (Kn1) gene in conjunction with mutations that alter the tomato compound leaf. We show that misexpression of Kn1 confers different phenotypes on simple and compound leaves. Up to 2000 leaflets, organized in compound reiterated units, are formed in tomato leaves expressing Kn1. In contrast, Kn1 induces leaf malformations but fails to elicit leaf ramification in plants with inherent simple leaves such as Arabidopsis or in tomato mutant plants with simple leaves. Moreover, the tomato Kn1 ortholog, unlike that of Arabidopsis, is expressed in the leaf primordia. Presumably, the two alternative leaf forms are conditioned by different developmental programs in the primary appendage that is common to all types of leaves."
https://openalex.org/W2015411731,"Cell division in haploid yeast gives rise to a ""mother"" cell capable of mating-type switching and a ""daughter"" cell that is not. Switching is initiated by the HO endonuclease, whose gene is only transcribed in cells that have previously given birth to a bud (mother cells). HO expression depends on a minimyosin, She1p/Myo4p, which accumulates preferentially in growing buds. We describe a gene, ASH1, that is necessary to repress HO in daughters. ASH1 encodes a zinc finger protein whose preferential accumulation in daughter cell nuclei at the end of anaphase depends on She1p/Myo4p. The greater abundance of Ash1p in daughter cells is responsible for restricting HO expression to mother cells."
https://openalex.org/W2042903750,"Certain cell types give rise to progeny that adopt different patterns of gene expression in the absence of any differences in their environment. Cells of budding yeast give birth to mother and daughter cells that differ in that only mother cells express the HO endonuclease gene and thereby switch mating types. We describe the identification of five genes, called SHE1-SHE5, that encode cytoplasmic proteins required for mother-specific HO expression. She1p, which is identical to the minimyosin Myo4p, and She3p are not, however, mother-specific proteins. On the contrary, they accumulate in growing buds. She proteins might be required for the transport of factors that promote HO repression from the mother cell into its bud. In an accompanying paper, we show that SHE genes are needed for the accumulation in daughter nuclei of Ash1p, a repressor of HO."
https://openalex.org/W2090014472,"S. cerevisiae cells exhibit asymmetric determination of cell fate. Cell division yields a mother cell, which is competent to transcribe the HO gene and switch mating type, and a daughter cell, which is not. We have isolated a mutant in which daughters transcribe HO and switch mating type. This mutation defines the ASH1 gene (asymmetric synthesis of HO). Deletion and overexpression of ASH1 cause reciprocal cell fate transformations: in ash1Î” strains, daughters switch mating type as efficiently as mothers. Conversely, overexpression of ASH1 inhibits switching in mother cells. Ash1p has a zinc finger motif related to those of GATA transcriptional regulators. Ash1p is localized to the daughter nucleus in cells that have undergone nuclear division. Thus, Ash1p is a cell fate determinant that is asymmetrically localized to the daughter nucleus where it inhibits HO transcription."
https://openalex.org/W2085515309,"Some TAF subunits of transcription factor TFIID play a pivotal role in transcriptional activation by mediating protein-protein interactions, whereas other TAFs direct promoter selectivity via protein-DNA recognition. Here, we report that purified recombinant TAFII250 is a protein serine kinase that selectively phosphotylates RAP74 but not other basal transcription factors or common phosphoacceptor proteins. The phosphorylation of RAP74 also occurs in the context of the complete TFIID complex. Deletion analysis revealed that TAFII250 contains two distinct kinase domains each capable of autophosphorylation. However, both the N- and C-terminal kinase domains of TAFII250 are required for efficient transphosphorylation of RAP74 on serine residues. These findings suggest that the targeted phosphorylation of RAP74 by TAFII250 may provide a mechanism for signaling between components within the initiation complex to regulate transcription."
https://openalex.org/W2120809584,"Heterochronic genes control the timing of vulval development in the C. elegans hermaphrodite. lin-14 or lin-28 loss-of-function mutations cause the vulval precursor cells (VPCs) to enter S phase and to divide one larval stage earlier than in the wild type. A precocious vulva is formed by essentially normal cell lineage patterns, governed by the same intercellular signals as in the wild type. Mutations that prevent the normal developmental down-regulation of lin-14 activity delay or block VPC division and prevent vulval differentiation. A genetic pathway that includes lin-4, lin-14, and lin-28 controls when VPCs complete G1 and also controls when VPCs acquire the competence to respond to the intercellular patterning signals and express vulval fates."
