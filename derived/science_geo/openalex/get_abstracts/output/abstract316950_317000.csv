https://openalex.org/W2056959679,"Competition between female kin for local limiting resources may explain a male-biased secondary sex ratio in the prosimian Galago crassicaudatus. Data demonstrating the skewed sex ratio, a brief summary of field observations on the species, and a simple mathematical statement of the hypothesis are presented. Local resource competition may influence sex ratio in other mammals."
https://openalex.org/W2034135575,Measurements of radon-222 in seawater suggest the following. The radium-226 content of surface water in both the Atlantic and Pacific oceans is uniformly close to about 4 x 10(-14) gram per liter. The deep Pacific has a concentration of radium-226 that is four times higher and the deep Atlantic a concentration twice as high as that of the surface. These distribution profiles can be explained by the same particle-settling rate for radium-226 from surface to depth for the two oceans and by a threefold longer residence time of water in the deep Pacific than in the deep Atlantic. The vertical distribution of the deficiency of radon-222 in the surface water of the northwest Pacific Ocean suggests a coefficient of vertical eddy diffusion as high as 120 square centimeters per second and a gas-exchange rate for carbon dioxide in surface water between 14 and 60 moles per square meter per year. Vertical profiles of the excess of radon-222 in near-bottom water of the South Atlantic give coefficients of vertical eddy diffusion ranging from 1.5 to more than 50 square centimeters per second.
https://openalex.org/W2010763806,"Selected species of Coccolithophoridae from recent sediments and mid-Wisconsin glacial sediments of the North Atlantic were examined in an attempt to determine cooling effects. All species showed a definite shift southward during the glacial period. The average shift in this planktonic population was 15 degrees of latitude, with the greatest change in the eastern Atlantic. A paleoisotherm map can be drawn on the basis of the temperature boundaries of coccolithophorids. The species boundaries indicate a possible shift in position of the subtropical gyral to a glacial position roughly parallel to the 33-degree line of latitude."
https://openalex.org/W2035742009,"Analysis of sodium carbonate-bicarbonate brines from closed basins in volcanic terranes of Oregon and Kenya reveals silica contents of up to 2700 parts per million at pH's higher than 10. These high concentrations of SiO(2) can be attributed to reaction of waters with silicates, and subsequent evaporative concentration accompanied by a rise in pH. Supersaturation with respect to amorphous silica may occur and persist for brines that are out of contact with silicate muds and undersaturated with respect to trona; correlation of SiO(2) with concentration of Na and total CO(2) support this interpretation. Addition of more-dilute waters to alkaline brines may lower the pH and cause inorganic precipitation of substantial amounts of silica."

These peats indicate that during glacial times of low sea level terrestrial vegetation covered the region that is now the continental shelf in an unbroken extension from the adjacent land areas to the north and west.

https://openalex.org/W2124150900,"The existence of magnetic materials has been known almost since prehistoric times, but only in the 20th century has it been understood how and why the magnetic susceptibility is influenced by chemical composition or crystallographic structure. In the 19th century the pioneer work of Oersted, Ampere, Faraday, and Henry revealed the intimate connection between electricity and magnetism. Maxwell's classical field equations paved the way for the wireless telegraph and the radio. At the turn of the present century Zeeman and Lorentz received the second Nobel Prize in Physics for respectively observing and explaining in terms of classical theory the so-called normal Zeeman effect. The other outstanding early attempt to understand magnetism at the atomic level was provided by the semiempirical theories of Langevin and Weiss. To account for paramagnetism, Langevin (1) in 1905 assumed in a purely ad hoc fashion that an atomic or molecular magnet carried a permanent moment /, whose spatial distribution was determined by the Boltzmann factor. It seems today almost incredible that this elegantly simple idea"

https://openalex.org/W1963798407,"According to theories of model stellar atmospheres only stars of spectral types from O to about B3 may be expected to be bright in the ultraviolet-wavelength region. Observations of the strong resonance lines between 911.6 and 1900 Ã… will yield new information permitting construction of better models for the outermost layers of OB stars. However, an adequate theory of line-formation, including non-l.t.e. effects, should be used if an accurate physical representation is to result. Already it has been demonstrated beyond doubt that O and B0 supergiants are surrounded by expanding atmospheres."

The technique involves comparing pollen samples taken from the birds' head feathers with pollen reference standards collected in the same area, which simplifies analysis of pollination patterns in a complex community."

https://openalex.org/W4250483575,"From the Committee's extensive study of the Bureau's functions, its programs for discharging these functions, the facilities of the Bureau and its professional personnel, as well as from discussions with many scientists and engineers, it has reached some general conclusions. The major ones are listed: 1. The Bureau of Standards is of vital importance to national strength. 2. It is an organization with a splendid record and tradition, internationally recognized and respected. 3. It is, in general, staffed with professional men of competence, integrity and loyalty to the Bureau's functions and objectives. 4. With the increasing range and depth of technology, the need for the services of the Bureau of Standards becomes even more important and its functions more complex. The accurate determination of physical constants, the properties of materials, standards and standards practices and testing and evaluation procedures are all essential serviees for our industrial society. 5. Since the close of the war the technology of the nation has shot rapidly forward. The Bureau's basic programs expanded until 1950 but at a rate beneath that justified by the needs. Since 1950 the decrease in basic programs must be considered as tragic. The ground lost since 1950 should be regained in the next two fiscal years and the programs then expanded as detailed studies by the Director and his advisory committees find necessary. 6. Scientific and technical services to other agencies of Government are important responsibilities of the Bureau. In general, the Bureau has discharged these responsibilities well. 7. The Department of Defense and the Atomic Energy Commission have made broad and significant use of the Bureau. Their use of the Bureau in areas other than development of weapons is of value to the Bureau in its basic programs and should be encouraged. 8. The volume of weaponry development work has become large in comparison with all other activities of the Bureau. Its relative size and its effects on the other Bureau programs make its transfer from the Bureau desirable. 9. Other agencies of Government do not make as large use of the services of the Bureau as might well be expected. The Committee believes that an increase in the use of the Bureau by other agencies of Government should be encouraged. 10. If the recommendations of the Committee are followed, the Bureau should be in a positon to perform its authorized functions in balance at the minimum level for the nation's needs within a four-year period."
