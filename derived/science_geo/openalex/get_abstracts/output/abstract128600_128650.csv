https://openalex.org/W2090931660,"Understanding the neurobiological mechanisms of addiction requires an integration of basic neuroscience with social psychology, experimental psychology, and psychiatry. Addiction is presented as a cycle of spiralling dysregulation of brain reward systems that progressively increases, resulting in compulsive drug use and a loss of control over drug-taking. Sensitization and counteradaptation are hypothesized to contribute to this hedonic homeostatic dysregulation, and the neurobiological mechanisms involved, such as the mesolimbic dopamine system, opioid peptidergic systems, and brain and hormonal stress systems, are beginning to be characterized. This framework provides a realistic approach to identifying the neurobiological factors that produce vulnerability to addiction and to relapse in individuals with a history of addiction."
https://openalex.org/W2105470099,"Expression of Agouti protein is normally limited to the skin where it affects pigmentation, but ubiquitous expression causes obesity. An expressed sequence tag was identified that encodes Agouti-related protein, whose RNA is normally expressed in the hypothalamus and whose levels were increased eightfold in ob/ob mice. Recombinant Agouti-related protein was a potent, selective antagonist of Mc3r and Mc4r, melanocortin receptor subtypes implicated in weight regulation. Ubiquitous expression of human AGRP complementary DNA in transgenic mice caused obesity without altering pigmentation. Thus, Agouti-related protein is a neuropeptide implicated in the normal control of body weight downstream of leptin signaling."
https://openalex.org/W2157383890,"Scientific advances over the past 20 years have shown that drug addiction is a chronic, relapsing disease that results from the prolonged effects of drugs on the brain. As with many other brain diseases, addiction has embedded behavioral and social-context aspects that are important parts of the disorder itself. Therefore, the most effective treatment approaches will include biological, behavioral, and social-context components. Recognizing addiction as a chronic, relapsing brain disorder characterized by compulsive drug seeking and use can impact society's overall health and social policy strategies and help diminish the health and social costs associated with drug abuse and addiction."
https://openalex.org/W2085497102,"The first fully automated design and experimental validation of a novel sequence for an entire protein is described. A computational design algorithm based on physical chemical potential functions and stereochemical constraints was used to screen a combinatorial library of 1.9 x 10(27) possible amino acid sequences for compatibility with the design target, a betabetaalpha protein motif based on the polypeptide backbone structure of a zinc finger domain. A BLAST search shows that the designed sequence, full sequence design 1 (FSD-1), has very low identity to any known protein sequence. The solution structure of FSD-1 was solved by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and indicates that FSD-1 forms a compact well-ordered structure, which is in excellent agreement with the design target structure. This result demonstrates that computational methods can perform the immense combinatorial search required for protein design, and it suggests that an unbiased and quantitative algorithm can be used in various structural contexts."
https://openalex.org/W2052690509,"Several lines of evidence suggest that accumulation of cytoplasmic β-catenin transduces an oncogenic signal. We show that β-catenin is ubiquitinated and degraded by the proteosome and that β-catenin stability is regulated by a diacylglycerol-independent protein kinase C-like kinase activity, which is required for β-catenin ubiquitination. We also define a six-amino acid sequence found in both β-catenin and the NF-κB regulatory protein IκBα, which, upon phosphorylation, targets both proteins for ubiquitination. Mutation of a single serine within the ubiquitination targeting sequence prevents ubiquitination of β-catenin. Mutations within the ubiquitination targeting sequence of β-catenin may be oncogenic.

Consistent with these two functions within the cell, the protein is localized primarily in two intracellular pools; a membrane pool involved in cadherin-mediated cell-cell adhesion and a cytoplasmic pool important for signaling (1Peifer M.

The role of β-catenin in cell-cell adhesion has been well studied. It links cadherins to α-catenin and the actin cytoskeleton, which results in the formation of the adherens junction (1Peifer M. Trends Cell Biol. 1995; 5: 224-229Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar, 2Gumbiner B. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 7: 634-640Crossref Scopus (384) Google Scholar). Tyrosine phosphorylation of β-catenin can regulate cell-cell adhesion by disrupting particular protein-protein interactions (3Behrens J. Vakaet L. Friis R. Winterhager E. Van Roy F. Mareel M.M.

The Drosophila and Xenopus homologs of β-catenin are also known to be involved in signaling pathways that regulate embryonic patterning.

The Xenopus pathway is comprised of the vertebrate homologs of the Drosophila proteins Wg and Zw3 (Wnt-1 and glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK3β), respectively) and regulates dorsal axis formation (2Gumbiner B. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 7: 634-640Crossref Scopus (384) Google Scholar). More recently, the interaction of β-catenin with members of the LEF/TCF family of transcription factors was shown to be important in Wnt signaling and in colon cancer (5Behrens J. von Kries J.P.

Science. 1997; 275: 1787-1790Crossref PubMed Scopus (3517) Google Scholar). β-Catenin signaling in embryogenesis and oncogenesis appears to be regulated by controlling the accumulation of cytoplasmic β-catenin. Activation of the Wnt (Wg) pathway results in the inhibition of GSK3β (ZW3) activity, which, in turn, results in stabilization of cytoplasmic β-catenin (Arm) (1Peifer M. Trends Cell Biol. 1995; 5: 224-229Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar, 9Peifer M. Sweeton D. Casey M. Wieschaus E.

The tumor suppressor protein APC appears to be required for the normal degradation of β-catenin as mutated forms of APC result in high levels of free (i.e.cytoplasmic) β-catenin with a longer half-life (11Munemitsu S. Albert I. Souza B. Rubinfeld B. Polakis P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 3046-3050Crossref PubMed Scopus (957) Google Scholar). The mechanism by which GSK3β and APC regulate β-catenin stability is unknown. Although GSK3β can directly phosphorylate APC and β-cateninin vitro, it is not clear how these interactions regulate β-catenin stability in vivo (12Yost C. Torres M. Miller J.R. Huang E. Kimelman D. Moon R.T. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1443-1454Crossref PubMed Scopus (1020) Google Scholar, 13Rubinfeld B. Albert I. Porfiri E. Fiol C. Munemitsu S. Polakis P. Science. 1996; 272: 1023-1026Crossref PubMed Scopus (1310) Google Scholar). In this report we show that β-catenin is normally degraded by the ubiquitin/proteosome pathway. We also show that certain protein kinase C (PKC) inhibitors cause a dramatic accumulation of cytoplasmic β-catenin by inhibiting its ubiquitination. In addition, we define a six-amino acid motif that is involved in targeting both β-catenin and the inhibitor of NF-κB, IκBα, for ubiquitination. A serine to alanine mutation within this ubiquitination targeting sequence (UTS) stabilizes the protein by inhibiting its ubiquitination. Reagents, Antibodies, and Cells- ALLN (calpain inhibitor I), ALLM (calpain inhibitor II), GF-109203X (bisindoylmaleimide), and TPA were purchased from Boehringer Mannheim. Lactacystin and calphostin C were purchased from Calbiochem. Ro31-8220 was a gift from Dr. Robert Glazer. The monoclonal anti-β-catenin was purchased from Transduction Laboratories. The anti-ubiquitin polyclonal was raised by Dr. Weissman (23Cook D. Fry M.J. Hughes K. Sumathipala R. Woodgett J.R. Dale T.C. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4526-4536Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar). The anti-HA antibody (monoclonal clone HA-11) was purchased from Babco. SKBR3 and HBL100 cell lines were acquired from the ATCC and maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% penicillin/streptomycin. Nonidet P-40 extractions were performed as described previously (14Byers S. Pishvaian M. Crockett C. Peer C. Tozeren A. Sporn M. Anzano M. Lechleider R. Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 3265-3273Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) except that 10 mm N-ethylmaleimide (NEM) was added to the lysis buffer. Cytoplasmic fractionation was performed by washing cells twice in phosphate-buffered saline and removing all remnants of the final wash. The cells were incubated in ice-cold hypotonic lysis buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 0.2 mm MgCl2, 5 mm NEM, and 10 mm ALLN) for 5 min on ice. The cells were scraped and mechanically disrupted by 30 strokes in a Dounce homogenizer. Greater than 95% of the cells were lysed as judged by light microscopy. The lysates were transferred to an ultracentrifuge tube containing a 5 × inhibitor solution (250 mm NaF, 5 mm sodium vanadate, 25 mm NEM, aprotinin, leupeptin, pepstatin A, and 4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluoride). The insoluble components of the lysates were pelleted at 100,000 × g for 1 h. The supernatant was designated the S100 or cytoplasmic fraction, and the pellet was the P100 fraction. In some experiments the P100 fraction was extracted with Nonidet P-40 buffer. Lysates were boiled in 2 × Laemlli sample buffer with 10% β-mercaptoethanol and separated on 8% or 4–12% polyacrylamide gels (Novex). Immunoprecipitations were performed on equal amounts of Nonidet P-40 lysates. The lysates were precleared once with 10 μg non-immune mouse IgG and 100 μl of protein G-Sepharose (Life Technologies, Inc.) and once with 100 μl of protein G-Sepharose, both for 1.5 h in the cold. The lysates were incubated in the cold for 1.5 h with 6 μg of non-immune mouse IgG or monoclonal anti-β-catenin. Protein G-Sepharose was added for 45 min. The protein G-antibody-antigen complexes were pelleted in a cold microcentrifuge and washed six times in cold Nonidet P-40 buffer without inhibitors. The immunoprecipitated proteins were boiled for 5 min and separated by SDS-PAGE. The proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride (Millipore) and treated as described in Ref.15Hou D.

The nine-amino acid HA-tag was added to the C terminus of β-catenin using polymerase chain reaction. The β-catenin/HA construct was cloned into theBamHI site of the pcDNA3 vector (Invitrogen). Mutagenesis of serine 37 was performed using the Quick-Change site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). Transfections were performed by calcium-phosphate precipitation (16Chen C. Okayama H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 2745-2752Crossref PubMed Scopus (4824) Google Scholar). The calcium-phosphate/DNA precipitate was incubated with the cells for 6 h. SKBR3 cells were shocked with 20% glycerol in serum-free medium for 4 min before washing and then the medium was replaced. Assays were performed 24–72 h after transfection. Proteins that are to be degraded by the ubiquitin/proteosome system are first conjugated to multiple copies of the small protein ubiquitin through isopeptide linkages (17Ciechanover A. Cell. 1994; 79: 13-21Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1602) Google Scholar). These ubiquitinated proteins are then recognized and degraded by the 26 S proteosome. Inhibition of the proteosome results in the accumulation of the ubiquitinated forms of those proteins normally degraded by the proteosome. To determine whether β-catenin is degraded by this system, human breast epithelial cell lines were treated with the peptide aldehyde proteosomal inhibitor ALLN or a related peptide aldehyde that has 50–100-fold lower potency as a proteosomal inhibitor. Anti-β-catenin immunoblots revealed that the proteosomal inhibitor at a dose as low as 1 μm resulted in the accumulation of β-catenin, including the appearance of high molecular weight (HMW) β-catenin species (Fig.1 A). The same result was found using the specific proteosomal inhibitor lactacystin (Fig.1 B). These experiments were conducted with both SKBR3 and HBL100 cell lines with similar results. To show that β-catenin is ubiquitinated before proteosomal degradation, we immunoprecipitated β-catenin from HBL100 cells treated with either ALLN or vehicle (Me2SO) alone and detected ubiquitinated material by immunoblot. Only when cells were treated with the proteosomal inhibitor did a significant amount of ubiquitin immunoreactivity co-precipitate with β-catenin, indicating that it is conjugated to ubiquitin prior to degradation by the proteosome. These data demonstrate unequivocally that β-catenin is normally degraded by the proteosome following ubiquitination. GSK3β is a member of the Wnt/Wg pathway, and its activity is required to maintain low levels of cytoplasmic β-catenin (9Peifer M. Sweeton D. Casey M. Wieschaus E. Development ( Camb .). 1994; 120: 369-380PubMed Google Scholar, 12Yost C. Torres M. Miller J.R. Huang E. Kimelman D. Moon R.T. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1443-1454Crossref PubMed Scopus (1020) Google Scholar). In addition, GSK3β itself can be regulated by several other serine kinases. In vitro, p70 S6 kinase, p90Rsk, Akt/protein kinase B (PKB), and certain PKC isoforms phosphorylate and regulate GSK3β activity (18Goode N. Hughes K. Woodgett J.R. Parker P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16878-16882Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Sutherland C. Leighton I.A. Cohen P. Biochem. J. 1993; 296: 15-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (758) Google Scholar, 20Sutherland C. Cohen P. FEBS Lett. 1994; 338: 37-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar, 21Cross D.A.E. Alessi D.R. Cohen P. Andjelkovich M. Hemmings B.A. Nature. 1995; 378: 785-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (4397) Google Scholar). Several other growth factors, including EGF and IGF also result in the inactivation of GSK3β (22Woodgett J.R. Plyte S.E. Pulverer B.J. Mitchell J.A. Hughes K. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1993; 21: 905-907Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). In cultured cells, inhibitor studies showed that the activity of a TPA-sensitive PKC isoform is required to inactivate GSK3β in response to the Wg signal (23Cook D. Fry M.J. Hughes K. Sumathipala R. Woodgett J.R. Dale T.C. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4526-4536Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar). This PKC isoform appeared to be specifically involved in Wg-mediated regulation of GSK3β, as it was not involved in other GSK3β regulating signals (e.g. insulin, EGF, IGF-1, and serum) (23Cook D. Fry M.J. Hughes K. Sumathipala R. Woodgett J.R. Dale T.C. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4526-4536Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar). No studies have determined the effect of PKC inhibition on β-catenin accumulation. Cells were treated with different PKC inhibitors and assayed for β-catenin accumulation. In the HBL100 cell line, which has high levels of membrane-associated and low levels of cytoplasmic β-catenin, two bisindoylmaleimide-type PKC inhibitors (GF-109203X and Ro31-8220) caused a dramatic increase in the cytoplasmic pool but not the membrane pool (Fig. 2 B). The same result was seen in Madin-Darby canine kidney cells (data not shown). In SKBR3 cells, which have very low levels of β-catenin protein in both pools, there was a large increase in both cytoplasmic and membrane (Nonidet P-40-soluble) pools (data not shown). PKC activity is required for Wnt-1 signaling to inhibit GSK3β activity (23Cook D. Fry M.J. Hughes K. Sumathipala R. Woodgett J.R. Dale T.C. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4526-4536Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar). Although this study did not investigate the effect of PKC inhibitors on β-catenin stability, one would anticipate that inhibition of PKC would have resulted in decreased β-catenin stability. TPA-induced down-regulation of DAG-dependent PKCs also prevented Wnt from inhibiting GSK3β (23Cook D. Fry M.J. Hughes K. Sumathipala R. Woodgett J.R. Dale T.C. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4526-4536Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar). In contrast, neither the PKC inhibitor calphostin C nor TPA-induced down-regulation of PKCs had a significant effect on the accumulation of cytoplasmic β-catenin in the present study (Fig. 2, C andD). In this experiment, TPA treatment completely down-regulated PKCα, the major PKC isoform expressed in these cells (data not shown). Our interpretation of these results is based on the different mechanisms of the inhibitors. The bisindoylmaleimides inhibit both DAG-dependent and -independent PKC isoforms by competing with ATP for binding to the kinase, whereas calphostin C and long term phorbol ester treatment inhibit only DAG-dependent PKC activities. It should be noted that the bisindoylmaleimide Ro31-8220 has no direct effect on GSK3β activity and actually acts to prevent the decrease in activity normally induced by Wg (23Cook D. Fry M.J. Hughes K. Sumathipala R. Woodgett J.R. Dale T.C. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4526-4536Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar). The inhibitor profile of the PKC isoform involved in β-catenin accumulation indicates that it may be a member of the DAG-independent class of PKCs known as atypical PKCs (aPKC). These results distinguish it from the DAG-dependent PKC isoform that is responsible for Wnt-dependent GSK3β regulation (23Cook D. Fry M.J. Hughes K. Sumathipala R. Woodgett J.R. Dale T.C. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4526-4536Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar). In addition to inhibitors of PKC, lithium chloride, which is an inhibitor of GSK3β (as well as other enzymes), was used to investigate its effects on β-catenin accumulation (24Manji H.K. Potter W.Z. Lenox R.H. Arch. Gen. Psychiatry. 1995; 52: 531-543Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar, 25Klein P.S. Melton D.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 8455-8459Crossref PubMed Scopus (2098) Google Scholar). Treatment of Xenopus embryos with lithium chloride results in the formation of a secondary dorsal axis in the embryo, phenotypes that are also characteristic of ectopic Wnt or β-catenin overexpression (2Gumbiner B. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 7: 634-640Crossref Scopus (384) Google Scholar,26Funayama N. Fagotto F. McCrea P. Gumbiner B.M. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 959-968Crossref PubMed Scopus (500) Google Scholar). Treatment with 30 mm results in the accumulation of cytoplasmic β-catenin within HBL100 and SKBR3 cells (Fig.2 E). This suggests that the effects of lithium that are seen in Xenopus embryos are a result of increased cytoplasmic β-catenin. The bisindoylmaleimide PKC inhibitors and lithium may increase cytoplasmic β-catenin by inhibiting its ubiquitination and, therefore, its degradation. To investigate this possibility, SKBR3 and HBL100 cells were treated overnight with the proteosomal inhibitor ALLN to generate the HMW ubiquitin-conjugated forms of β-catenin. In addition to the proteosomal inhibitor, we treated some cells with inhibitory or non-inhibitory doses of the PKC inhibitor GF-109203X and LiCl. The reduction or complete abrogation of β-catenin ubiquitination by these inhibitors demonstrates that the aPKC-like activity and GSK3β, respectively, are required for ubiquitination of β-catenin (Fig. 3). This parallels other work regarding the role of GSK3β in regulating β-catenin degradation and introduces the possibility that an atypical PKC-like enzyme may also play a role in this important process. Since N-terminal truncated forms of β-catenin and Arm accumulate in the cytoplasm, we analyzed the N terminus of β-catenin for serine residues that might be involved in regulating β-catenin ubiquitination (27Munemitsu S. Albert I. Rubinfeld B. Polakis P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4088-4094Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Five N-terminal serines that are well conserved between β-catenin, Armadillo, and plakoglobin are present between β-catenin amino acids 29 and 47. Mutation of three of these serines as well as a conserved threonine results in β-catenin accumulation and axis duplication inXenopus (12Yost C. Torres M. Miller J.R. Huang E. Kimelman D. Moon R.T. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1443-1454Crossref PubMed Scopus (1020) Google Scholar). Interestingly, two of these serines lie within a six-amino acid region that is almost identical to a motif in the protein IκBα, which, upon serine phosphorylation, targets it for ubiquitination (see Fig. 4 A) (28Chen Z. Hagler J. Palombella V.J. Melandri F. Scherer D. Ballard D. Maniatis T. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1586-1597Crossref PubMed Scopus (1172) Google Scholar). Mutations of one or both of the serines in this motif stabilize IκBα by inhibiting its ubiquitination (28Chen Z. Hagler J. Palombella V.J. Melandri F. Scherer D. Ballard D. Maniatis T. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1586-1597Crossref PubMed Scopus (1172) Google Scholar). Mutations of β-catenin serine 37 were recently reported to occur in several melanoma cell lines (29Rubinfeld B. Robbins P. El-Gamil M. Albert I. Porfiri E. Polakis P. Science. 1997; 275: 1790-1792Crossref PubMed Scopus (1137) Google Scholar). To determine the role that phosphorylation of this motif within β-catenin might play in its ubiquitination and degradation, a serine to alanine mutation was made at residue 37 of β-catenin. The wild-type and mutant β-catenin constructs were transfected into SKBR3 cells. The cytoplasmic proteins (S100) were isolated from the other cellular proteins (P100), and both fractions separated by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted for β-catenin. The S37A mutant β-catenin accumulated to approximately 3-fold the levels of the wild-type 36 h after transfection (Fig. 4 B). This differential accumulation was only detected in the cytoplasmic pool of β-catenin as the P100 fraction shows approximately equal accumulation of the two forms of β-catenin. To determine whether this increased accumulation was due to reduced ubiquitination of the mutant, SKBR3 cells were transfected with wild-type, the S37A mutant, or vector alone. The transfectants were lysed and assayed for the accumulation of HMW ubiquitinated β-catenin by immunoblotting with an anti-HA antibody (Fig. 4 C). The wild-type β-catenin was ubiquitinated efficiently, while the mutant form was not ubiquitinated. Interestingly, ubiquitinated β-catenin only accumulated in the S100 fraction of the SKBR3 cell line (data not shown). This result strongly suggests that, like IκBα, a specific serine (residue 37, in β-catenin) must be phosphorylated prior to ubiquitination of β-catenin. Phosphorylation of this serine is probably an important mechanism by which the amount of β-catenin within the cell is regulated. Indeed, mutations of this serine and serine 33, which is also located within the UTS, occur in several melanoma and colon cancer cell lines (8Morin P.J. Sparks A.B. Korinek V. Barker N. Clevers H. Vogelstein B. Kinzler K.W. Science. 1997; 275: 1787-1790Crossref PubMed Scopus (3517) Google Scholar, 29Rubinfeld B. Robbins P. El-Gamil M. Albert I. Porfiri E. Polakis P. Science. 1997; 275: 1790-1792Crossref PubMed Scopus (1137) Google Scholar). In these cases, the mutant forms of β-catenin were presumed to be transforming. These data show that β-catenin is normally degraded by the ubiquitin/proteosome system and that at least two serine/threonine kinases regulate this process, GSK3β and an aPKC-like enzyme. We also identify a common motif within β-catenin and IκBα, which, upon being phosphorylated, regulates the stability of these proteins by targeting them for ubiquitination. The identity of the kinase(s) that phosphorylates the IκBα UTS is unknown. The aPKC-like kinase activity that regulates β-catenin ubiquitination may directly phosphorylate the UTS, or it may be involved in the regulation of the kinase that does. Regardless of the specific interactions, it is likely that signaling through β-catenin is regulated by a complex network of kinases that regulate its ubiquitination (Fig.5 A). The regulation of β-catenin signaling per se may well be an important mechanism by which multiple intracellular signals are integrated. We propose that several signaling pathways, such as signaling through growth factors (e.g. the Wnts, EGF, IGF, insulin), APC, and retinoic acid-induced adhesion, may converge by regulating the accumulation of cytoplasmic β-catenin (Fig.5 B) (10Papkoff J. Rubinfeld B. Schryver B. Polakis P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2128-2134Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar, 14Byers S. Pishvaian M. Crockett C. Peer C. Tozeren A. Sporn M. Anzano M. Lechleider R. Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 3265-3273Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Several conserved serines and threonines within a small region of the N terminus of β-catenin are targets for mutation in colon cancers and melanomas. It is likely that many, if not all, of these residues must be phosphorylated to target β-catenin for degradation (8Morin P.J. Sparks A.B. Korinek V. Barker N. Clevers H. Vogelstein B. Kinzler K.W.

We propose that as the cellular context changes, β-catenin phosphorylation will be altered, and these alterations will determine whether or not it is ubiquitinated and degraded. The definition of a specific region that targets an oncogenic protein for degradation may prove to be useful in the design of modalities for cancer therapy. We hypothesize that the UTS will be recognized by β-catenin-directed ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes, which may themselves constitute therapeutic targets.

This interaction was inhibited by leptomycin B, a drug that prevents the function of the CRM1 protein in yeast. To analyze the role of the CRM1-NES interaction in nuclear export, a transport assay based on semipermeabilized cells was developed. In this system, which reconstituted NES-, cytosol-, and energy-dependent nuclear export, leptomycin B specifically blocked export of NES-containing proteins. Thus, the CRM1 protein could act as a NES receptor involved in nuclear protein export."

Anergic alloantigen-specific human T cells contained phosphorylated Cbl that coimmunoprecipitated with Fyn. The adapter protein CrkL was associated with both phosphorylated Cbl and the guanidine nucleotide–releasing factor C3G, which catalyzes guanosine triphosphate (GTP) exchange on Rap1. Active Rap1 (GTP-bound form) was present in anergic cells. Forced expression of low amounts of Rap1-GTP in Jurkat T cells recapitulated the anergic defect and blocked T cell antigen receptor (TCR)– and CD28-mediated IL-2 gene transcription. Therefore, Rap1 functions as a negative regulator of TCR-mediated IL-2 gene transcription and may be responsible for the specific defect in IL-2 production in T cell anergy."

An important factor controlling the generation of activity in this system is the amplitude and duration of inhibitory postsynaptic potentials (IPSPs) in thalamocortical cells, which depend on the pattern of activity generated in thalamic reticular and perigeniculate cells. Activation of single ferret perigeniculate neurons generated three distinct patterns of GABAergic IPSPs in thalamocortical neurons of the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus: Low-frequency tonic discharge resulted in small-amplitude IPSPs mediated by GABA A receptors, burst firing resulted in large-amplitude GABA A IPSPs, and prolonged burst firing activated IPSPs mediated by GABA A and GABA B receptors. These functional properties of GABAergic inhibition can reconfigure the operations of thalamocortical networks into patterns of activity associated with waking, slow-wave sleep, and generalized seizures."

In neurons, the cytosolic calcium concentration is tightly regulated and represents a critical parameter for a variety of intracellular signaling processes. Intracellular calcium levels are modulated either by release of calcium from internal stores or by calcium entry across the plasma membrane through ligand- or voltage-gated calcium channels (1Bootman M.D. Berridge M.J.

Ginty D.D. Weber M.J. Greenberg M.E. Neuron. 1994; 12: 1207-1221Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (595) Google Scholar). In PC12 cells, a rat pheochromocytoma cell line widely used as a model system for neuronal differentiation, calcium influx rapidly induces tyrosine phosphorylation of the adaptor protein SHC and SHC-Grb2 complex formation, steps known to couple cell surface receptors such as receptor tyrosine kinases to Ras (6Lev S. Moreno H. Martinez R. Canoll P. Peles E. Musacchio J.M. Plowman G.D. Rudy B. Schlessinger J. Nature. 1995; 376: 737-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (1246) Google Scholar). Using a PC12 subline overexpressing a dominant-negative mutant of the cytoplasmatic tyrosine kinase Src, Rusanescu et al. found that inhibiton of membrane depolarization induced SHC tyrosine phosphorylation and MAPK activation (7Rusanescu G. Qi H. Thomas S.M. Brugge J.S. Haleggoua S. Neuron. 1995; 15: 1415-1425Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). Moreover calcium influx following membrane depolarization was recently reported to mediate ligand-independent epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine phosphorylation in this system (8Rosen L.B. Greenberg M.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 1113-1118Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Although direct evidence is lacking regarding whether this represents an essential signaling event for activation of the MAPK pathway, this finding raises the possibility that in PC12 cells calcium may play a role in the EGFR transactivation mechanism as previously demonstrated for signaling through G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) in Rat-1 fibroblasts (9Daub H. Weiss F.U. Wallasch C. Ullrich A. Nature. 1996; 379: 557-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (1314) Google Scholar). In addition to membrane depolarization-induced activation of the MAPK pathway (7Rusanescu G. Qi H. Thomas S.M. Brugge J.S. Haleggoua S. Neuron. 1995; 15: 1415-1425Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar), GPCR-mediated signaling was also reported to involve Src function (10Dikic I. Tokiwa G. Lev S. Courtneidge S.A. Schlessinger J. Nature. 1996; 383: 547-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (876) Google Scholar, 11Luttrell L.M. Hawes B.E. van Biesen T. Luttrell D.K. Lansing T.J. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol.

Chem. 1996; 271: 10329-10333Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Moreover, the tyrosine kinase PYK2, a relative of the focal adhesion kinase, was implicated in triggering the MAPK pathway in PC12 cells (6Lev S. Moreno H. Martinez R. Canoll P. Peles E. Musacchio J.M. Plowman G.D. Rudy B. Schlessinger J. Nature. 1995; 376: 737-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (1246) Google Scholar). This raised the possibility that concerted action of receptor tyrosine kinases and cytoplasmatic tyrosine kinases might be necessary to activate certain signaling cascades in response to GPCR stimulation or membrane depolarization (10Dikic I. Tokiwa G. Lev S. Courtneidge S.A. Schlessinger J. Nature. 1996; 383: 547-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (876) Google Scholar).To analyze potential EGFR function in calcium-dependent signaling, we developed a PC12 cell line that expresses the dominant-negative EGFR mutant HER-CD533 under the control of a tetracycline-sensitive promotor system (14Gossen M. Bujard H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 5547-5551Crossref PubMed Scopus (4227) Google Scholar). In this system specific EGFR inhibition strongly attenuates SHC tyrosine phosphorylation and MAPK activation in response to both membrane depolarization and bradykinin stimulation. Moreover, we find that calcium ionophore treatment of PC12 cells is sufficient to trigger EGFR tyrosine phosphorylation, whereas EGFR transactivation in response to the GPCR ligand bradykinin is critically dependent on the presence of extracellular calcium. Therefore calcium-dependent EGFR transactivation integrates various extracellular stimuli and provides a link to downstream signal progression.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONTo analyze EGFR function in response to stimuli such as membrane depolarization or GPCR activation in PC12 cells, we employed the tetracycline-controlled gene expression system for expression of the dominant-negative EGFR mutant HER-CD533 (14Gossen M. Bujard H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 5547-5551Crossref PubMed Scopus (4227) Google Scholar, 15Redemann N. Holzmann B. von Rüden T. Wagner E.F. Schlessinger J. Ullrich A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 491-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). This mutant lacks the cytoplasmic domain and disrupts EGFR downstream signaling by forcing endogenous wild-type receptors into signaling-incompetent heterodimers. In the PC12/HER-CD533/Tet cell line, expression of HER-CD533 is suppressed in the presence of tetracycline, whereas removal of tetracycline results in an approximately 20-fold induction within 48 h, as determined by metabolic labeling and subsequent quantification of immunoprecipitated mutant receptor (Fig.1 A). When these cells were subjected to 75 mm extracellular KCl to trigger membrane depolarization in the presence of tetracycline, this treatment stimulated EGFR tyrosine phosphorylation in agreement with previous observations (8Rosen L.B. Greenberg M.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 1113-1118Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1 B). The same effect was achieved by treatment of undifferentiated PC12/HER-CD533/Tet cultures with bradykinin in analogy to previously reported findings for the GPCR ligands endothelin-1, lysophosphatidic acid, and thrombin in Rat-1 fibroblasts (9Daub H. Weiss F.U. Wallasch C. Ullrich A. Nature. 1996; 379: 557-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (1314) Google Scholar). In PC12/HER-CD533/Tet, expression of HER-CD533 upon removal of tetracycline strongly interfered with EGFR tyrosine phosphorylation upon treatment with KCl, bradykinin, and EGF, whereas in control cells these stimuli resulted in increased EGFR tyrosine phosphorylation unaffected by the removal of tetracycline (Fig.1 B). Reprobing with anti-EGFR antibody revealed that comparable amounts of protein were present, which supported the conclusion that EGFR inhibition was due to dominant-negative HER-CD533 action. Importantly, in PC12/HER-CD533/Tet cells elevation of cytoplasmatic calcium upon bradykinin incubation or membrane depolarization was similar when HER-CD533 expression was either induced or repressed (Fig. 1 C), indicating that functional coupling to calcium mobilization was unaffected by EGFR inhibition.Tyrosine phosphorylation of the adaptor protein SHC represents a prominent receptor-proximal signaling step upon EGFR activation (16Bonfini L. Migliaccio E. Pelicci G. Lanfrancone L. Pelicci P.G. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 257-261Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). Analysis of crude cell lysates indicated that the HER-CD533 mutant specifically abolished EGF-stimulated SHC tyrosine phosphorylation, whereas the NGF-induced response remained unaltered (Fig.2 A). The identity of the 52-kDa phosphotyrosine-containing protein as the major SHC isoform was confirmed by reprobing immunoblots with a specific antibody. To answer the question of whether the previously reported membrane depolarization- or bradykinin-induced SHC tyrosine phosphorylation (6Lev S. Moreno H. Martinez R. Canoll P. Peles E. Musacchio J.M. Plowman G.D. Rudy B. Schlessinger J. Nature. 1995; 376: 737-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (1246) Google Scholar) is mediated through transactivation of the EGFR, we immunoprecipitated SHC after stimulation of PC12/HER-CD533/Tet cells in the presence or the absence of tetracyline. As shown in Fig. 2 B, HER-CD533 induction suppressed both KCl- and bradykinin-stimulated SHC tyrosine phosphorylation, demonstrating an essential role of the EGFR in both signals.Figure 2Effect of EGFR inhibition on SHC tyrosine phosphorylation. For expression of HER-CD533, tetracycline was removed as indicated for 48 h. A, quiescent PC12 cells were treated with EGF (1 and 10 ng/ml) or NGF (50 ng/ml) for 90 s and lysed, and crude cell lysates were immunoblotted with αPY antibody (upper panel) following reprobing with polyclonal anti-SHC antibody (lower panel). B, serum-starved cells were treated for 90 s with 75 mm KCl or 1 μm bradykinin and lysed, and SHC was immunoprecipitated (IP) using polyclonal anti-SHC antiserum and immunoblotted with αPY antibody (upper panel), followed by reprobing with anti-SHC antibody (lower panels). Ab, antibody; αPY, anti-phosphotyrosine.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)We next analyzed the role of EGFR function in the activation of the MAPK pathway in PC12 cells. To address this question, we examined the effect of EGFR inhibition on activation of ERK-2 following KCl or bradykinin treatment. ERK-2 activity was measured with an immunocomplex kinase assay using myelin basic protein as an exogenous substrate. As shown in Fig. 3 (upper panel), expression of HER-CD533 strongly and reproducibly attenuated ERK-2 activation upon KCl or bradykinin treatment by approximately 80%. For reasons currently unknown, the stimulation of MAPK activity following bradykinin treatment was reproducibly weaker compared with stimulation with KCl. As expected, EGF-induced MAPK stimulation was completely suppressed, whereas the NGF-induced response, included as a control, was not significantly affected. Interestingly, despite weaker stimulation of Shc tyrosine phosphorylation (Fig. 2 A), NGF induced MAPK activity as potently as 1 ng/ml EGF. This suggested that upon NGF stimulation additional signal transducers such as the recently described Grb2-binding protein FRS2 may contribute to the activation of the Ras/MAPK pathway (17Kouhara H. Hadari Y.R. Spivak-Kroizman T. Schilling J. Bar-Sagi D. Schlessinger J. Cell. 1997; 89: 693-702Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (717) Google Scholar).Figure 3Effect of EGFR inhibition on stimulation of MAPK activity. PC12/HER-CD533/Tet (upper panel) and PC12/control cells (lower panel) were pretreated as indicated with or without tetracyline for 48 h and serum-starved for 20 h. Cells were stimulated for 5 min with 75 mmKCl, 1 μm bradykinin, 1 ng/ml EGF or NGF and lysed, and endogenous ERK2 activity was determined using MBP as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Phosphorylated MBP was visualized by autoradiography after gel electrophoresis. IP, immunoprecipitation.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Furthermore, any influence of tetracycline on MAPK activation was excluded using control cells (Fig. 3, lower panel). Similar effects on MAPK activation upon these treatments were obtained with nanomolar concentrations of the EGFR-specific inhibitor AG1478 (data not shown).The recently reported finding of ligand-independent EGFR tyrosine phosphorylation upon membrane depolarization-mediated calcium influx (8Rosen L.B. Greenberg M.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 1113-1118Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar) raised the question of whether calcium may be critical for EGFR transactivation in PC12 cells. As shown in Fig.4 A, elimination of extracellular calcium with 3 mm EGTA for 5 min completely abolished the increase of EGFR tyrosine phosphorylation upon bradykinin stimulation. Moreover, when we used the calcium ionophore ionomycin to directly elevate intracellular calcium levels, enhanced phosphorylation of the EGFR on tyrosine was readily detected. Tetracycline controlled expression of HER-CD533 strongly interfered with ionomycin-induced EGFR tyrosine phosphorylation (Fig. 4 B), demonstrating that calcium is both necessary and sufficient for ligand-independent EGFR transactivation in PC12 cells. Interestingly EGFR inhibition differentially reduced ERK2 activation levels induced by treatment with ionomycin or KCl and bradykinin by 50 and 80%, respectively (Figs. 3and 4 C). This quantitative difference could be due to a differential parallel involvement of the calcium-dependent Ras-GRF in the activation of a tyrosine kinase-independent Ras/MAPK pathway in neuronal cells (18Buchsbaum R. Telliez J.B. Goonesekera S. Feig L.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4888-4896Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar).Figure 4Influence of calcium on EGFR transactivation in PC12 cells. A, quiescent PC12 cells were pretreated as indicated with 3 mm EGTA for 5 min prior to stimulation with 1 μm bradykinin. After cell lysis, EGFR was immunoprecipitated (IP) with rabbit polyclonal anti-EGFR antibody (Ab). Tyrosine-phosphorylated EGFR was detected by immunoblotting with αPY antibody (upper panel) followed by reprobing with anti-EGFR antibody (lower panel).B, serum-starved PC12/HER-CD533/Tet cells were pretreated with or without tetracycline for 48 h, stimulated with vehicle or with 1.8 μm ionomycin for the indicated time, and lysed. Tyrosine-phosphorylated EGFR was detected as described above.C, quiescent PC12 cells were stimulated with 1.8 μm ionomycin and lysed, and endogenous ERK2 activity was determined using MBP as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Phosphorylated MBP was visualized by autoradiography after gel electrophoresis.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Interestingly, elevation of intracellular calcium levels was also reported to trigger tyrosine phosphorylation and activation of the cytoplasmatic tyrosine kinase PYK2 in PC12 cells (6Lev S. Moreno H. Martinez R. Canoll P. Peles E. Musacchio J.M. Plowman G.D. Rudy B. Schlessinger J. Nature. 1995; 376: 737-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (1246) Google Scholar). Moreover, this tyrosine kinase had been suggested to link stimuli such as membrane depolarization and bradykinin to MAPK activation. Because PYK2 was reported to interact with Src upon bradykinin stimulation (10Dikic I. Tokiwa G. Lev S. Courtneidge S.A. Schlessinger J. Nature. 1996; 383: 547-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (876) Google Scholar), this association might be required for Src to efficiently phosphorylate its cellular substrates on tyrosine residues. Moreover, because overexpression of a dominant-negative Src mutant had been reported to interfere with depolarization-induced SHC tyrosine phosphorylation (7Rusanescu G. Qi H. Thomas S.M. Brugge J.S. Haleggoua S. Neuron. 1995; 15: 1415-1425Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar), our findings raise the question how the EGFR and the cytoplasmatic tyrosine kinase complex Src/PYK2 are functionally linked in PC12 cells. Because oncogenic Src appears to activate the EGFR by tyrosine phosphorylation at nonregular sites (19Wasilenko W.J. Payne D.M. Fitzgerald D.L. Weber M.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 309-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), Src and PYK2 could act upstream and utilize EGFR for further signal transmission. Alternatively, to reconcile the results presented here and those reported earlier (6Lev S. Moreno H. Martinez R. Canoll P. Peles E. Musacchio J.M. Plowman G.D. Rudy B. Schlessinger J. Nature. 1995; 376: 737-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (1246) Google Scholar, 10Dikic I. Tokiwa G. Lev S. Courtneidge S.A. Schlessinger J. Nature. 1996; 383: 547-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (876) Google Scholar), EGFR transactivation might occur independently and parallel to Src/PYK2 with SHC binding to phosphorylated EGFR and subsequent SHC phosphorylation by activated Src.The tetracycline-controlled inducible expression system used in this study to analyze EGFR function in PC12 cells may be instrumental for finding answers to these questions. Because, at the concentrations used, tetracycline is without any detectable effect and the temporal and quantitative parameters of mutant EGFR expression can be tightly controlled, this system provides an excellent tool for the examination of multiple elements in the cellular signal transmission network of the PC12 model system. In the context of the nervous system where the EGFR is found in various areas (20Tucker M.S. Khan I. Fuchs-Young R. Price S. Steininger T.L. Greene G. Wainer B.H. Rosner M.R. Brain Res. 1993; 631: 65-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), our findings provide a new basis for the investigation of GPCR mediated signals and their significance for biological phenomena such as neuronal cell survival and neurodegenerative disease. In neurons, the cytosolic calcium concentration is tightly regulated and represents a critical parameter for a variety of intracellular signaling processes. Intracellular calcium levels are modulated either by release of calcium from internal stores or by calcium entry across the plasma membrane through ligand- or voltage-gated calcium channels (1Bootman M.D. Berridge M.J. Cell. 1995; 83: 675-678Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar, 2Gallin W.J. Greenberg M.E. Curr. Opin.

Stimuli such as membrane depolarization result in activation of l-type voltage-sensitive calcium channels, leading to calcium-mediated induction of a specific set of genes and thereby contributing to physiological responses such as neuronal differentiation and survival (4Bading H.

Using a PC12 subline overexpressing a dominant-negative mutant of the cytoplasmatic tyrosine kinase Src, Rusanescu et al. found that inhibiton of membrane depolarization induced SHC tyrosine phosphorylation and MAPK activation (7Rusanescu G. Qi H. Thomas S.M. Brugge J.S. Haleggoua S. Neuron. 1995; 15: 1415-1425Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). Moreover calcium influx following membrane depolarization was recently reported to mediate ligand-independent epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine phosphorylation in this system (8Rosen L.B. Greenberg M.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 1113-1118Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Although direct evidence is lacking regarding whether this represents an essential signaling event for activation of the MAPK pathway, this finding raises the possibility that in PC12 cells calcium may play a role in the EGFR transactivation mechanism as previously demonstrated for signaling through G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) in Rat-1 fibroblasts (9Daub H. Weiss F.U. Wallasch C. Ullrich A. Nature. 1996; 379: 557-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (1314) Google Scholar). In addition to membrane depolarization-induced activation of the MAPK pathway (7Rusanescu G. Qi H. Thomas S.M. Brugge J.S. Haleggoua S. Neuron. 1995; 15: 1415-1425Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar), GPCR-mediated signaling was also reported to involve Src function (10Dikic I. Tokiwa G. Lev S. Courtneidge S.A. Schlessinger J. Nature. 1996; 383: 547-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (876) Google Scholar, 11Luttrell L.M. Hawes B.E. van Biesen T. Luttrell D.K. Lansing T.J. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol.

Chem. 1996; 271: 10329-10333Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Moreover, the tyrosine kinase PYK2, a relative of the focal adhesion kinase, was implicated in triggering the MAPK pathway in PC12 cells (6Lev S. Moreno H. Martinez R. Canoll P. Peles E. Musacchio J.M. Plowman G.D. Rudy B. Schlessinger J. Nature. 1995; 376: 737-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (1246) Google Scholar). This raised the possibility that concerted action of receptor tyrosine kinases and cytoplasmatic tyrosine kinases might be necessary to activate certain signaling cascades in response to GPCR stimulation or membrane depolarization (10Dikic I. Tokiwa G. Lev S. Courtneidge S.A. Schlessinger J. Nature. 1996; 383: 547-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (876) Google Scholar). To analyze potential EGFR function in calcium-dependent signaling, we developed a PC12 cell line that expresses the dominant-negative EGFR mutant HER-CD533 under the control of a tetracycline-sensitive promotor system (14Gossen M. Bujard H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 5547-5551Crossref PubMed Scopus (4227) Google Scholar). In this system specific EGFR inhibition strongly attenuates SHC tyrosine phosphorylation and MAPK activation in response to both membrane depolarization and bradykinin stimulation. Moreover, we find that calcium ionophore treatment of PC12 cells is sufficient to trigger EGFR tyrosine phosphorylation, whereas EGFR transactivation in response to the GPCR ligand bradykinin is critically dependent on the presence of extracellular calcium. Therefore calcium-dependent EGFR transactivation integrates various extracellular stimuli and provides a link to downstream signal progression. RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONTo analyze EGFR function in response to stimuli such as membrane depolarization or GPCR activation in PC12 cells, we employed the tetracycline-controlled gene expression system for expression of the dominant-negative EGFR mutant HER-CD533 (14Gossen M. Bujard H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 5547-5551Crossref PubMed Scopus (4227) Google Scholar, 15Redemann N. Holzmann B. von Rüden T. Wagner E.F. Schlessinger J. Ullrich A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 491-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). This mutant lacks the cytoplasmic domain and disrupts EGFR downstream signaling by forcing endogenous wild-type receptors into signaling-incompetent heterodimers. In the PC12/HER-CD533/Tet cell line, expression of HER-CD533 is suppressed in the presence of tetracycline, whereas removal of tetracycline results in an approximately 20-fold induction within 48 h, as determined by metabolic labeling and subsequent quantification of immunoprecipitated mutant receptor (Fig.1 A). When these cells were subjected to 75 mm extracellular KCl to trigger membrane depolarization in the presence of tetracycline, this treatment stimulated EGFR tyrosine phosphorylation in agreement with previous observations (8Rosen L.B. Greenberg M.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 1113-1118Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1 B). The same effect was achieved by treatment of undifferentiated PC12/HER-CD533/Tet cultures with bradykinin in analogy to previously reported findings for the GPCR ligands endothelin-1, lysophosphatidic acid, and thrombin in Rat-1 fibroblasts (9Daub H. Weiss F.U. Wallasch C. Ullrich A. Nature. 1996; 379: 557-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (1314) Google Scholar). In PC12/HER-CD533/Tet, expression of HER-CD533 upon removal of tetracycline strongly interfered with EGFR tyrosine phosphorylation upon treatment with KCl, bradykinin, and EGF, whereas in control cells these stimuli resulted in increased EGFR tyrosine phosphorylation unaffected by the removal of tetracycline (Fig.1 B). Reprobing with anti-EGFR antibody revealed that comparable amounts of protein were present, which supported the conclusion that EGFR inhibition was due to dominant-negative HER-CD533 action. Importantly, in PC12/HER-CD533/Tet cells elevation of cytoplasmatic calcium upon bradykinin incubation or membrane depolarization was similar when HER-CD533 expression was either induced or repressed (Fig. 1 C), indicating that functional coupling to calcium mobilization was unaffected by EGFR inhibition.Tyrosine phosphorylation of the adaptor protein SHC represents a prominent receptor-proximal signaling step upon EGFR activation (16Bonfini L. Migliaccio E. Pelicci G. Lanfrancone L. Pelicci P.G. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 257-261Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). Analysis of crude cell lysates indicated that the HER-CD533 mutant specifically abolished EGF-stimulated SHC tyrosine phosphorylation, whereas the NGF-induced response remained unaltered (Fig.2 A). The identity of the 52-kDa phosphotyrosine-containing protein as the major SHC isoform was confirmed by reprobing immunoblots with a specific antibody. To answer the question of whether the previously reported membrane depolarization- or bradykinin-induced SHC tyrosine phosphorylation (6Lev S. Moreno H. Martinez R. Canoll P. Peles E. Musacchio J.M. Plowman G.D. Rudy B. Schlessinger J. Nature. 1995; 376: 737-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (1246) Google Scholar) is mediated through transactivation of the EGFR, we immunoprecipitated SHC after stimulation of PC12/HER-CD533/Tet cells in the presence or the absence of tetracyline. As shown in Fig. 2 B, HER-CD533 induction suppressed both KCl- and bradykinin-stimulated SHC tyrosine phosphorylation, demonstrating an essential role of the EGFR in both signals.We next analyzed the role of EGFR function in the activation of the MAPK pathway in PC12 cells. To address this question, we examined the effect of EGFR inhibition on activation of ERK-2 following KCl or bradykinin treatment. ERK-2 activity was measured with an immunocomplex kinase assay using myelin basic protein as an exogenous substrate. As shown in Fig. 3 (upper panel), expression of HER-CD533 strongly and reproducibly attenuated ERK-2 activation upon KCl or bradykinin treatment by approximately 80%. For reasons currently unknown, the stimulation of MAPK activity following bradykinin treatment was reproducibly weaker compared with stimulation with KCl. As expected, EGF-induced MAPK stimulation was completely suppressed, whereas the NGF-induced response, included as a control, was not significantly affected. Interestingly, despite weaker stimulation of Shc tyrosine phosphorylation (Fig. 2 A), NGF induced MAPK activity as potently as 1 ng/ml EGF. This suggested that upon NGF stimulation additional signal transducers such as the recently described Grb2-binding protein FRS2 may contribute to the activation of the Ras/MAPK pathway (17Kouhara H. Hadari Y.R. Spivak-Kroizman T. Schilling J. Bar-Sagi D. Schlessinger J. Cell. 1997; 89: 693-702Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (717) Google Scholar).Figure 3Effect of EGFR inhibition on stimulation of MAPK activity. PC12/HER-CD533/Tet (upper panel) and PC12/control cells (lower panel) were pretreated as indicated with or without tetracyline for 48 h and serum-starved for 20 h. Cells were stimulated for 5 min with 75 mmKCl, 1 μm bradykinin, 1 ng/ml EGF or NGF and lysed, and endogenous ERK2 activity was determined using MBP as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Phosphorylated MBP was visualized by autoradiography after gel electrophoresis.

Similar effects on MAPK activation upon these treatments were obtained with nanomolar concentrations of the EGFR-specific inhibitor AG1478 (data not shown).The recently reported finding of ligand-independent EGFR tyrosine phosphorylation upon membrane depolarization-mediated calcium influx (8Rosen L.B. Greenberg M.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 1113-1118Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar) raised the question of whether calcium may be critical for EGFR transactivation in PC12 cells. As shown in Fig.4 A, elimination of extracellular calcium with 3 mm EGTA for 5 min completely abolished the increase of EGFR tyrosine phosphorylation upon bradykinin stimulation. Moreover, when we used the calcium ionophore ionomycin to directly elevate intracellular calcium levels, enhanced phosphorylation of the EGFR on tyrosine was readily detected. Tetracycline controlled expression of HER-CD533 strongly interfered with ionomycin-induced EGFR tyrosine phosphorylation (Fig. 4 B), demonstrating that calcium is both necessary and sufficient for ligand-independent EGFR transactivation in PC12 cells. Interestingly EGFR inhibition differentially reduced ERK2 activation levels induced by treatment with ionomycin or KCl and bradykinin by 50 and 80%, respectively (Figs. 3and 4 C). This quantitative difference could be due to a differential parallel involvement of the calcium-dependent Ras-GRF in the activation of a tyrosine kinase-independent Ras/MAPK pathway in neuronal cells (18Buchsbaum R. Telliez J.B. Goonesekera S. Feig L.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4888-4896Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar).Figure 4Influence of calcium on EGFR transactivation in PC12 cells. A, quiescent PC12 cells were pretreated as indicated with 3 mm EGTA for 5 min prior to stimulation with 1 μm bradykinin. After cell lysis, EGFR was immunoprecipitated (IP) with rabbit polyclonal anti-EGFR antibody (Ab). Tyrosine-phosphorylated EGFR was detected by immunoblotting with αPY antibody (upper panel) followed by reprobing with anti-EGFR antibody (lower panel).B, serum-starved PC12/HER-CD533/Tet cells were pretreated with or without tetracycline for 48 h, stimulated with vehicle or with 1.8 μm ionomycin for the indicated time, and lysed.

Moreno H. Martinez R. Canoll P. Peles E. Musacchio J.M. Plowman G.D. Rudy B. Schlessinger J. Nature. 1995; 376: 737-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (1246) Google Scholar). Moreover, this tyrosine kinase had been suggested to link stimuli such as membrane depolarization and bradykinin to MAPK activation. Because PYK2 was reported to interact with Src upon bradykinin stimulation (10Dikic I. Tokiwa G. Lev S. Courtneidge S.A. Schlessinger J. Nature. 1996; 383: 547-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (876) Google Scholar), this association might be required for Src to efficiently phosphorylate its cellular substrates on tyrosine residues. Moreover, because overexpression of a dominant-negative Src mutant had been reported to interfere with depolarization-induced SHC tyrosine phosphorylation (7Rusanescu G. Qi H. Thomas S.M. Brugge J.S. Haleggoua S. Neuron. 1995; 15: 1415-1425Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar), our findings raise the question how the EGFR and the cytoplasmatic tyrosine kinase complex Src/PYK2 are functionally linked in PC12 cells. Because oncogenic Src appears to activate the EGFR by tyrosine phosphorylation at nonregular sites (19Wasilenko W.J. Payne D.M. Fitzgerald D.L. Weber M.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 309-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), Src and PYK2 could act upstream and utilize EGFR for further signal transmission. Alternatively, to reconcile the results presented here and those reported earlier (6Lev S. Moreno H. Martinez R. Canoll P. Peles E. Musacchio J.M. Plowman G.D. Rudy B. Schlessinger J. Nature. 1995; 376: 737-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (1246) Google Scholar, 10Dikic I. Tokiwa G. Lev S. Courtneidge S.A. Schlessinger J. Nature. 1996; 383: 547-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (876) Google Scholar), EGFR transactivation might occur independently and parallel to Src/PYK2 with SHC binding to phosphorylated EGFR and subsequent SHC phosphorylation by activated Src.The tetracycline-controlled inducible expression system used in this study to analyze EGFR function in PC12 cells may be instrumental for finding answers to these questions. Because, at the concentrations used, tetracycline is without any detectable effect and the temporal and quantitative parameters of mutant EGFR expression can be tightly controlled, this system provides an excellent tool for the examination of multiple elements in the cellular signal transmission network of the PC12 model system. In the context of the nervous system where the EGFR is found in various areas (20Tucker M.S. Khan I. Fuchs-Young R. Price S. Steininger T.L. Greene G. Wainer B.H. Rosner M.R. Brain Res. 1993; 631: 65-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), our findings provide a new basis for the investigation of GPCR mediated signals and their significance for biological phenomena such as neuronal cell survival and neurodegenerative disease.

To understand this interaction at the molecular level, and to design more active molecules, it is critical to determine what regions of CCR5 are responsible for the specificity of chemokine binding and co-receptor activity. Relatively little is known concerning the structure-function relationships of CC-chemokine receptors and their ligands, in general. Monteclaro and Charo (20Monteclaro F.S. Charo I.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19084-19092Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar) reported that the amino terminus of CCR2b is necessary for MCP-1 binding, with the extracellular loops being important for receptor activation and signaling. They have also shown that the third extracellular loop, but not the amino terminus of CCR1, is required for ligand binding and signal transduction (20Monteclaro F.S. Charo I.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19084-19092Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). We have shown previously that the NH2 terminus and the first extracellular loop of CCR5 are responsible for the specificity of interaction with M-tropic HIV-1 strains (21Rucker J. Samson M.

Indeed, although the two receptors are closely related structurally, their ligand specificity is mutually exclusive: CCR2b responds to MCP-1, MCP-2, MCP-3, and MCP-4 (22Charo I.F. Myers S.J.

We found that the second extracellular loop of CCR5 is critical for high affinity binding of MIP-1α, MIP-1β, and RANTES, and for the functional response to these chemokines. By contrast, the amino-terminal domain of CCR2b is responsible for the high affinity binding of MCP-1 and MCP-3, but other regions, including the second extracellular loop of the receptor, are necessary for efficient signal transduction.DISCUSSIONCCR5 constitutes the main functional co-receptor for M-tropic HIV-1 strains, since homozygote carriers for the mutant allele of the CCR5 gene are strongly resistant to infection by the virus, bothin vitro and in vivo (14Liu R.

It has also been widely documented that chemokines and chemokine analogs endowed with antagonistic properties are able to reduce the effectiveness of HIV-1 infection in vitro (13Cocchi F. DeVico A.L.

Padian N. Braun J.F. Kotler D.P. Wolinsky S.M. Koup R.A. Nat. Med. 1996; 2: 412-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (590) Google Scholar). Blocking the interaction of the virus with CCR5 by chemokines or analogs, monoclonal antibodies, or small chemicals could therefore constitute a major therapeutic implementation in the anti-HIV arsenal. The precise knowledge of the molecular interaction between CCR5 and chemokines on one side, and CCR5, gp120, and CD4 on the other side would help in designing molecules able to interfere efficiently with the early steps of viral entry.We have previously investigated the role of the various regions of CCR5 in the ability of the co-receptor to interact with gp120 from various strains of HIV-1 (and possibly with CD4) and initiate the fusion process (21Rucker J. Samson M. Doranz B.J. Libert F. Berson J.F. Yi Y. Smyth R.J. Collman R.G. Broder C.C. Vassart G. Doms R.W. Parmentier M. Cell. 1996; 87: 437-446Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). It was concluded that the first part of the NH2-terminal domain, as well as the first extracellular loop constitute the main regions conferring co-receptor properties to CCR5. This study, as well as similar studies made with simian immunodeficiency virus (31Edinger A.L. Amedee A. Miller K. Doranz B.J. Endres M. Sharron M. Samson M. Zhao-hai L. Clements J.E. Murphey-Corb M. Peiper S.C. Parmentier M. Broder C.C. Doms R.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 4005-4010Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar), showed that different viruses and strains, although using the same co-receptor (CCR5), are not dependent upon the same regions of the molecule for their specific interaction. We have now started to investigate the regions of CCR5 involved in chemokine recognition and subsequent functional response, using our panel of chimeric receptors. Our approach was based on the construction of chimeras between CCR5 and CCR2b. CCR2b is the chemokine receptor that presents the highest similarity with CCR5 (76% identity). By contrast, the ligand specificities of CCR2b and CCR5 are mutually exclusive so far, since CCR5 binds MIP-1α, MIP-1β, and RANTES, but no other known CC-chemokine (7Samson M. Labbé O. Mollereau C. Vassart G. Parmentier M. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 3362-3367Crossref PubMed Scopus (587) Google Scholar, 24Raport C.J. Gosling J. Schweickart V.L. Gray P.W. Charo I.F. J. Biol.

Leukocyte Biol. 1996; 60: 147-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar), while CCR2b binds MCP-1, MCP-2, MCP-3, and MCP-4 (22Charo I.F. Myers S.J. Herman A. Franci C. Connolly A.J. Coughlin S.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 2752-2756Crossref PubMed Scopus (640) Google Scholar, 23Franci C. Wong L.M. Van Damme J. Proost P. Charo I.F. J. Immunol. 1995; 154: 6511-6517PubMed Google Scholar),2 but not MIP-1α, MIP-1β, and RANTES. The ligand specificity is expected to be mediated partially by the extracellular domains of the receptor that share only 45% amino acid identity, while transmembrane segments and cytoplasmic loops are highly conserved (95% identity).We have first characterized the binding properties of CHO-K1 cell lines expressing CCR5 and CCR2b. We also showed that activation of CCR5-expressing CHO-K1 cells by MIP-α, MIP-1β, and RANTES can efficiently be monitored by a microphysiometer that measures the modifications of cell metabolism resulting from the activation of intracellular cascades (32Owicki J.C. Parce J.W. Biosens. & Bioelectronics. 1992; 7: 255-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). Similarly, stimulation of CCR2b-expressing cells by MCP-1 and MCP-3 can be monitored by this method, with a pharmacology identical to that reported previously using calcium mobilization (22Charo I.F. Myers S.J. Herman A. Franci C. Connolly A.J. Coughlin S.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 2752-2756Crossref PubMed Scopus (640) Google Scholar, 23Franci C. Wong L.M. Van Damme J. Proost P. Charo I.F. J. Immunol. 1995; 154: 6511-6517PubMed Google Scholar).Our results demonstrate that the closely related CCR5 and CCR2b receptors interact differently with their respective ligands. For CCR5, the central role of the second extracellular loop of the receptor is obvious for both high affinity binding and activation of the receptor: the second loop of CCR5 in a CCR2b background (chimera 2252) supported MIP-1α binding and signal transduction, while the replacement of this single domain in CCR5 (chimera 5525) abolishes both. All three ligands active on CCR5 (MIP-1α, MIP-1β, and RANTES) interact apparently in a similar way with the receptor. The prominent role of the second extracellular role of CCR5 in ligand specificity is compatible with the high divergence between CCR2b and CCR5 in this region: 16 out of 26 residues are different, including an extra cysteine residue not present in any of the chemoattractant receptors except CCR4. This cysteine may be involved in disulfide bridging with the first extracellular loop or NH2 terminus, which could result in very different three-dimensional structures between the two related receptors. Conserved residues include three sequential charged amino acids, and a highly conserved cysteine believed to form a disulfide with the first extracellular loop in all G protein-coupled receptors.Concerning CCR2b, the amino-terminal extracellular domain of the receptor plays a fundamental and non-redundant role in the high affinity binding of CC-chemokines active on this receptor. Indeed, this single CCR2B domain in a CCR5 background was sufficient to confer MCP-1 binding. The high sequence divergence between the NH2-terminal domains of CCR2b and CCR5 can easily account for their role in ligand specificity. Functional data show, however, that the high affinity binding site is both not sufficient and not absolutely necessary to promote chemokine-mediated activation of the receptor and of intracellular cascades. A chimera containing the CCR2b NH2 terminus (2555) binds MCP-1 but does not signal efficiently, while a chimera devoid of the CCR2b NH2terminus (5525) signals in response to MCP-1 but very little binding can be detected. These results are compatible with those reported earlier by Monteclaro and Charo (20Monteclaro F.S. Charo I.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19084-19092Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar) on the basis of CCR2b/CCR1 chimeras. These authors concluded similarly that the NH2terminus of CCR2b is necessary for high affinity binding, but that low affinity interaction with one or more extracellular loops is necessary to achieve receptor activation and signaling. From our data it appears that the second extracellular loop, as well as a combination of the first and third loops, can fulfill this function.Our data, as well as previous structure-function studies performed on other chemokine receptors, therefore support the concept that, despite the obvious similarity in the receptor primary structures, as well as in the three-dimensional structure of the ligands, the way chemokines interact with their respective receptors can vary widely from one receptor to another. The NH2-terminal domain has been involved in ligand specificity for other chemokine receptors of the CC and CXC families. The NH2 terminus of the interleukin-8 receptors (CXCR1 and CXCR2) are major determinants of ligand specificity (33LaRosa G.J. Thomas K.M. Kaufmann M.E. Mark R. White M. Taylor L. Gray G. Witt D.

Murphy P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 225-232Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). The amino terminus of DARC (Duffy antigen), an apparently non-functional receptor binding both CC and CXC chemokines, plays a critical role in ligand binding (37Zhao-hai L. Zi-xuan W. Horuk R. Hesselgesser H. Yan-chun L. Hadley T.J. Peiper S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26239-26245Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). By contrast, ligand specificity of CCR1 was reported to be mediated essentially by the third extracellular loop of the receptor (20Monteclaro F.S. Charo I.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19084-19092Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar).The different regions involved for each receptor in ligand binding can probably account for the diverse selectivities observed among chemokine receptors. As an example, the fact that CCR5 binds MIP-1α, MIP-1β, and RANTES, while CCR1 binds MIP-1α and RANTES but not MIP-1β is comprehensible considering that the dominant interaction of the ligands with the receptors are, respectively, within the second and third extracellular loops. In our set of experiments, the clear segregation of the regions, respectively, involved in high affinity binding of MIP-1α and MCP-1 results in the existence of chimeric receptors (2555, 2255) that are able to bind both CCR5 and CCR2b ligands efficiently. It should be stressed that chimeric receptor-based studies, such as ours, can only discriminate domains important for ligand selectivity. Conserved regions that would be required for ligand binding and/or functional response to the ligands could easily be overlooked. Additional mutagenesis studies on both the receptors and ligands will be necessary to fully understand how chemokine receptors interact with their respective receptor(s), and how binding results in receptor activation and signal transduction.From the present and previous data (21Rucker J. Samson M. Doranz B.J. Libert F. Berson J.F. Yi Y. Smyth R.J. Collman R.G. Broder C.C. Vassart G. Doms R.W. Parmentier M. Cell. 1996; 87: 437-446Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar), it is clear that the regions of CCR5 involved in chemokine ligand specificity, and in the specificity of cofactor usage for various HIV-1 strains are not identical. Chemokine selectivity is mediated by the second extracellular loop, while cofactor usage is dependent on the N terminus and first extracellular loop. This results in a clear dissociation in some chimeras between viral co-receptor activity and ligand binding or functional responsiveness (21Rucker J. Samson M. Doranz B.J. Libert F. Berson J.F. Yi Y.

The apparent lack of overlap between the regions involved in ligand binding and co-receptor usage raises the question of the mechanisms involved in the protective role of chemokines. Competition for the same binding site does not seem to be the most important factor, although steric hindrance at the outer surface of the receptor cannot be excluded. Additional work will be required to better understand at the molecular level the competition between chemokines and HIV for accessing CCR5. This knowledge will in turn be useful in assisting the design of novel antiviral compounds. Chemokines play fundamental roles in the physiology of acute and chronic inflammatory processes, as well as in dysregulations of these processes, by attracting and stimulating specific subsets of leukocytes (1Oppenheim J.J. Zachariae C.O. Mukaida N. Matsushima K. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1991; 9: 617-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (1823) Google Scholar, 2Baggiolini M. Dewald B. Moser B. Adv. Immunol. 1994; 55: 97-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (2258) Google Scholar). Chemokines are divided into two main families (CXC- and CC-chemokines) depending on the relative position of the first two conserved cysteines. Their actions are mediated by subfamilies of G protein-coupled receptors. To date, four functional receptors responding to CXC-chemokines (CXCR1 to 4) and eight receptors responding to CC-chemokines (CCR1 to 8) have been identified in the human.

Here, an intramolecular protein–protein interaction between the amino-terminal domain and the carboxyl-terminal ligand-binding domain of the rat olfactory CNG channel was shown to exert an autoexcitatory effect on channel activation. Calcium-calmodulin, which modulates CNG channel activity during odorant adaptation, blocked this interaction. A specific deletion within the amino-terminal domain disrupted the interdomain interaction in vitro and altered the gating properties and calmodulin sensitivity of expressed channels. Thus, the amino-terminal domain may promote channel opening by directly interacting with the carboxyl-terminal gating machinery; calmodulin regulates channel activity by targeting this interaction."
https://openalex.org/W1970746962,"Recent studies have shown that the Src homology-2 (SH2) domain-containing protein-tyrosine phosphatase, SHP-2, associates with the cytoplasmic domain of PECAM-1 as it becomes tyrosine-phosphorylated during platelet aggregation: a process that can be mimicked in part by small synthetic phosphopeptides corresponding to the cytoplasmic domain of PECAM-1 encompassing tyrosine residues Tyr-663 or Tyr-686. To further examine the molecular requirements for PECAM-1/SHP-2 interactions, we generated human embryonic kidney (HEK)-293 cell lines that stably expressed mutant forms of PECAM-1 harboring tyrosine to phenylalanine (Tyr → Phe) mutations in the cytoplasmic domain. Y663F and Y686F forms of PECAM-1 were tyrosine-phosphorylated to a somewhat lesser extent than wild-type PECAM-1, and a doubly substituted Y663,686F form of PECAM-1 failed to become tyrosine-phosphorylated, suggesting that the PECAM-1 cytoplasmic domain tyrosine residues 596, 636 and 701 do not serve as substrates for cellular kinases. Interestingly, SHP-2 binding was lost when either Tyr-663 or Tyr-686 were changed to phenylalanine, indicating that both residues are required for SHP-2/PECAM-1 association. Although PECAM-1 phosphopeptides NSDVQpY663TEVQV and DTETVpY686SEVRK stimulated the catalytic activity of the phosphatase to a similar extent, surface plasmon resonance studies revealed that the Tyr-663-containing peptide had approximately 10-fold higher affinity for SHP-2 than did the Tyr-686 peptide. Finally, peptido-precipitation analysis showed that the NH2-terminal SH2 domain of SHP-2 reacted preferentially with the Tyr-663 PECAM-1 phosphopeptide, while the Tyr-686 phosphopeptide associated only with the COOH-terminal SH2 domain of the phosphatase. Together, these data provide a molecular model for PECAM-1/SHP-2 interactions that may shed light on the downstream events that follow PECAM-1-mediated interactions of vascular cells."

The signaling pathways downstream of the TGFβ receptor complex that lead to the pleiotropic effects of TGFβ are still poorly understood. However, the recent identification of DPC4 and the related protein Smad3 (mothers against decapentaplegic) have provided initial insight into the mechanism of the TGFβ receptor signal transduction (8Zhang Y. Feng X.-H. Wu R.-Y. Derynck R. Nature. 1996; 383: 168-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (759) Google Scholar, 9Lagna G. Hata A. Hemmati-Brivanlou A. Massagué J.

Science. 1996; 271: 350-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (2176) Google Scholar). Smad3 but not DPC4 associates with the TGFβ receptors and is directly phosphorylated by the ligand-bound receptor complex (8Zhang Y. Feng X.-H. Wu R.-Y. Derynck R. Nature. 1996; 383: 168-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (759) Google Scholar). Coexpression of Smad3 along with DPC4 resulted in the synergetic activation of TGFβ-like responses suggesting that Smad3 act in partnership with DPC4 to initiate TGFβ signaling (8Zhang Y. Feng X.-H. Wu R.-Y. Derynck R. Nature. 1996; 383: 168-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (759) Google Scholar). Since DPC4 does not associate with nor become phosphorylated by the TGFβ receptors, these data raise the possibility that DPC4 may fulfill some function that is not regulated by receptor-dependent phosphorylation. Because TGFβ receptor can also trigger stress-activated protein kinase/c-Jun N-terminal kinase (SAPK/JNK) activation (11Atfi A. Djelloul S. Chastre E. Davis R. Gespach C. J. Biol.

G15E1b-luc and Gal4-VP16 were kindly provided by Dr. Roger Davis and Michael R. Green, respectively. The pEGFP vector encoding for the green fluorescence protein (GFP) was purchased fromCLONTECH. GST-Jun-(1–79) was expressed inEscherichia coli as described (13Minden A. Lin A. Claret F.G. Abo A. Karin M. Cell. 1995; 81: 1147-1157Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1447) Google Scholar). MDCK cells were transfected with expression vectors by the LipofectAMINETM method (Life Technologies, Inc.). Cells were subsequently incubated in the presence or absence of human TGFβ1 (2 ng/ml) for 12 h. The luciferase activities were normalized on the basis of β-galactosidase expression from pCMV5.LacZ-Control vector and protein content. Assays for SAPK/JNK activity were carried out as described (11Atfi A. Djelloul S. Chastre E. Davis R. Gespach C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1429-1432Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). We analyzed MDCK cells for apoptosis by phase-contrast microscopy 48 h after transfection. Transfected MDCK cells were fixed in PBS containing 0.5% glutaraldehyde for 15 min followed by washing in PBS with 5 mm MgCl2. Fixed cells were stained overnight with PBS containing 1 mg/ml 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl β-d-galactopyranoside, 5 mm potassium ferricyanide, 5 mm potassium ferrocyanide, 2 mmMgCl2, 0.02% Nonidet P-40. The number of blue-staining cells was determined microscopically. For the GFP, cells were fixed in PBS containing 4% paraformaldehyde, stained with Hoechst (2 μg/ml), and mounted. DNA fragmentation (TUNEL staining) was determined using the in situ cell death detection kit (Boehringer Mannheim). The TUNEL-stained cells were visualized by microscopy. To assess the apoptotic DNA damage, cells were collected, rinsed with Ca2+- and Mg2+-free PBS, lysed in lysis buffer (10 mm EDTA, 50 mm Tris (pH 8.0), 0.5% sodium lauryl sarcosine, 0.5 mg of proteinase K/ml), and incubated at 50 °C for 1 h. RNase A (0.5 mg/ml) was added, and lysates were incubated for an additional hour. DNA was electrophoresed in a 1% agarose gel in 0.5 × TBE running buffer (4.5 mm Tris, 4.5 mm boric acid, 62.5 μm EDTA). In comparison with the immediate and transient SAPK/JNK activation induced by other stimuli such as tumor necrosis factor-α (5 min) and anisomycin (13Minden A. Lin A. Claret F.G. Abo A. Karin M. Cell. 1995; 81: 1147-1157Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1447) Google Scholar, 14Coso O.A. Chiariello M. Yu J.-C. Teramoto H. Crespo P. Xu N. Miki T. Gutkind J.C. Cell. 1995; 81: 1137-1146Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1570) Google Scholar), treatment of MDCK cells with human TGFβ1 induces a delayed and persistent increase in SAPK/JNK activity that peaks at 8 h and reaches a maximal value of about 3–5-fold over the basal activity (11Atfi A. Djelloul S. Chastre E. Davis R. Gespach C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1429-1432Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). Therefore, we used conditioned medium from cells treated with TGFβ under conditions in which SAPK/JNK activation was readily observed (8 h) to address the question of whether TGFβ-induced SAPK/JNK activation occurs via a paracrine mechanism. This possibility seems more unlikely, since conditioned medium stimulation did not significantly induce the activation of SAPK/JNK at any time up to 30 min, although the addition of anisomycin to these cells led to the increase in SAPK/JNK activity under these experimental conditions (data not shown). In contrast with SAPK/JNK, TGFβ failed to activate p38 kinase under the same experimental conditions (data not shown). Thus, the increase in SAPK/JNK activity most likely resulted from phosphorylation and activation by an upstream kinase such as mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) kinase 4 (MKK4, also termed Sek1 or JNKK), a dual specificity protein kinase, which is structurally related to MKK3, the kinase that phosphorylates and promotes activation of p38 MAP kinase (15Dérijard B.

Nature. 1994; 372: 798-800Crossref PubMed Scopus (660) Google Scholar). The activation of SAPK/JNK indicated by our observations agrees with recent studies showing that TGFβ activates a novel MAPK kinase kinase (MAPKKK), known as TAK1, that may be involved in signal transduction by members of the TGFβ superfamily (15Dérijard B. Raingeaud J. Barrett T. Wu I.-H. Han J. Ulevitch R.J. Davis R.J. Science. 1995; 267: 682-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (1415) Google Scholar, 19Yamagushi K. Shirakabe K. Shibuya H. Irie K. Oishi I. Ueno N. Taniguchi T. Nishida E. Matsumoto K. Science. 1995; 270: 2008-2011Crossref PubMed Scopus (1178) Google Scholar). Activated TAK1 phosphorylates and promotes activation of MKK4, the kinase that controls activation of SAPK/JNK (19Yamagushi K. Shirakabe K. Shibuya H. Irie K. Oishi I. Ueno N. Taniguchi T. Nishida E. Matsumoto K. Science. 1995; 270: 2008-2011Crossref PubMed Scopus (1178) Google Scholar). Whether TAK1 kinase is downstream of the TGFβ receptor in the biochemical route to SAPK/JNK warrants further investigation. To investigate whether the SAPK/JNK signaling pathway participates in TGFβ signaling, we examined the effect of dominant-negative mutants of MEKK1, MKK4, and c-Jun expression on transcriptional activation by TGFβ. We made use of p3TP-Lux, a reporter construct that directs luciferase expression in response to TGFβ (6Wrana J.L. Attisano L. Càrcamo J. Zentella A. Doody J. Laiho M. Wang X.-F. Massagué J. Cell. 1992; 71: 1003-1014Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1372) Google Scholar). Expression of dominant-negative mutants MEKK1(K432A), MKK4(Ala), and c-Jun(TAM67) suppressed the TGFβ-induced reporter gene activity; similar results were obtained with all of the SAPK/JNK signaling pathway components in HepG2 and CHO cells ((11) and data not shown). Further evidence for the specificity of JNK signaling pathways in mediating these processes is provided by the inability of the dominant-interfering mutant of MKK3(Ala) to inhibit reporter gene activation by TGFβ (data not shown). DPC4 and the related protein Smad3 are also regulated by the TGFβ signal transduction pathway and may function to transmit TGFβ signals from the cytoplasm to the nucleus (4Massagué J. Cell. 1996; 85: 947-950Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (829) Google Scholar, 8Zhang Y. Feng X.-H. Wu R.-Y. Derynck R. Nature. 1996; 383: 168-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (759) Google Scholar, 9Lagna G. Hata A. Hemmati-Brivanlou A. Massagué J. Nature. 1996; 383: 832-836Crossref PubMed Scopus (809) Google Scholar). Consistent with previous studies, overexpression of wild-type DPC4, but not Smad3, into MDCK cells strongly increased the basal level of p3TP-Lux expression and potentiated the ability of TGFβ to induce reporter gene activity (8Zhang Y. Feng X.-H. Wu R.-Y. Derynck R. Nature. 1996; 383: 168-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (759) Google Scholar,9Lagna G. Hata A. Hemmati-Brivanlou A. Massagué J. Nature. 1996; 383: 832-836Crossref PubMed Scopus (809) Google Scholar). Coexpression of Smad3 along with DPC4 resulted in the synergetic activation of gene reporter expression, and this effect was enhanced by TGFβ addition (Fig. 1 A). The ability of the dominant-interfering mutant of c-Jun (TAM67) to inhibit TGFβ-induced transcriptional activation allows us to address the functional role of SAPK/JNK pathways in Smad3 and DPC4-mediated signaling events. TAM67 acts as a dominant-interfering mutant because of a deletion in the N-terminal transactivation domain of c-Jun that includes the binding site for SAPK/JNK (20Dérijard B. Hibi M. Wu I.-H. Barrett T. Su B. Deng T. Karin M. Davis R.J. Cell. 1994; 76: 1025-1037Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2957) Google Scholar, 21Rapp U.L. Troppmair J. Beck T. Birrer M.J. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 3493-3498PubMed Google Scholar). Expression of TAM67 is sufficient to block the superinduction of the gene reporter activity by TGFβ in cells coexpressing wild-type Smad3 and DPC4. Immunoblotting with anti-Flag antibody confirms that expression of TAM67 did not alter expression of Flag-Smad3 and Flag-DPC4 proteins (data not shown). Similar results were obtained with the dominant-negative mutant MEKK1(K432A) (Fig. 1 A), which is consistent with the hypothesis that SAPK/JNK function is required for transcriptional activation by Smad3 and DPC4 proteins. To determine the potential mechanism underlying the dominant-negative activity of TAM67, we investigated whether this mutant may alter the regulation of DPC4 transcriptional activity by TGFβ. When fused to the DNA binding domain of the yeast transactivator Gal4-(1–147), the C-terminal domain of DPC4 activated transcription from a promoter containing Gal4-binding sites (22Liu F. Hata A. Baker J. Doody J. Càrcamo J. Harland R. Massagué J. Nature. 1996; 381: 620-623Crossref PubMed Scopus (591) Google Scholar), thus raising the interesting possibility that DPC4 may act as a transcriptional activator to initiate TGFβ responses. In support of this hypothesis, we show that a Gal4 fusion protein containing the full-length DPC4 failed to stimulate transcription in this assay, but a strong increase of Gal4-DPC4 transcriptional activity was detected in MDCK cells expressing both Gal4-DPC4 and full-length Smad3 in the presence of TGFβ (Fig. 1 B). Similar to its effect on p3TP-Lux promoter activity, expression of TAM67 inhibits both basal and TGFβ-induced Gal4-DPC4 transcriptional activity (Fig. 1 B). As a control (Fig. 1 B), transfection of TAM67 produces little or no effect on a Gal4 fusion containing the potent acidic activating region of the herpes simplex virus VP16 protein (23Liu F. Green M.R. Nature. 1994; 368: 520-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). From these results, it is becoming evident that TAM67 acts specifically as a dominant-negative inhibitor in TGFβ signaling by blocking the function of endogenous DPC4 and Smad3 proteins and that inhibition of DPC4 transcriptional activity occurs at a level downstream of the SAPK/JNK signaling pathway. Our analysis of the regulation of DPC4 transcriptional activity by c-Jun was consistent with the possibility that c-Jun and DPC4 could interact and produce trans-activation of the 3TP-Lux reporter. One attractive possibility is that the dominant-interfering mutant of c-Jun (TAM67) binds and sequesters DPC4, thus removing it from its natural target. However, we were unable to detect any interactions between DPC4 and TAM67 using different methods, including immunoprecipitation followed by Western blotting and in vitro binding assays with GST-DPC4 produced in bacteria. Because association could be transient or unstable, these negative results do not completely rule out direct interactions of DPC4 and c-Jun. Another important biological activity mediated by the SAPK/JNK signaling pathway is the induction of programmed cell death (24Xia Z. Dickens M. Raingeaud J. Davis R.J. Greenberg M.E. Science. 1995; 270: 1326-1331Crossref PubMed Scopus (5045) Google Scholar, 25Verheij M. Bose R. Lin X.H. Yao B. Jarvis W.D. Grant S. Birrer M.J. Szabo E. Zon L.I. Kyriakis J.M. Haimovitz-Friedman A.

Chem. 1996; 271 (31929): 31929Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (856) Google Scholar). One mechanism by which JNK activation may contribute to cell death is by phosphorylating and enhancing the activity of c-Jun, which in turn regulates the activity of cell-killing genes. Consistent with this observation, death of serum-deprived PC12 cells does not require new gene transcription, although blockade of c-Jun activity by microinjection of anti-c-Jun antibodies or by ectopic expression of dominant-negative TAM67 inhibits their apoptotic death (24Xia Z. Dickens M. Raingeaud J. Davis R.J. Greenberg M.E. Science. 1995; 270: 1326-1331Crossref PubMed Scopus (5045) Google Scholar). Since the activity of DPC4 has been shown to be under the control of c-Jun, we were interested in determining whether DPC4 and Smad3 were able to trigger cell death. To test this hypothesis, we initially used a GFP cotransfection assay to determine the effects of DPC4 and Smad3 overexpression on cell viability. The MDCK cells expressing DPC4, but not Smad3, displayed morphological alterations typical of adherent cells undergoing apoptosis, becoming rounded, condensed, and detaching from the dish (Fig. 2). DNA staining with Hoechst 33258 (DNA dye bisbenzimide) showed that many of the DPC4-expressing cells had apoptotic nuclei, a feature not seen when control vector or Smad3 expression plasmids were used (Fig.2 A). DNA fragmentation analysis with the TUNEL method confirms that the death of MDCK cells induced by overexpression of DPC4 occurred by an apoptotic mechanism (Fig. 2 B). To further quantitate the effects of ectopic expression of DPC4 and Smad3 on cell viability, in a second independent approach, cotransfections were performed with vector expressing β-galactosidase instead of GFP. In this assay, MDCK cells which die by apoptosis round up and detach from the dishes, making the relative number of blue cells a good indicator of DPC4 and Smad3 function (27Stanger B.Z. Leder P. Lee T.-H. Kim E. Seed B. Cell. 1995; 81: 513-523Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (869) Google Scholar, 28Hsu H. Shu B. Pan M-G. Goeddel D.V. Cell. 1996; 84: 299-308Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1738) Google Scholar). By 48 h after transfection, over 57% of blue cells arising from cotransfection of DPC4 and the β-galactosidase showed morphological changes consistent with apoptosis, whereas only 10–20% of the blue cells that had been transfected with β-galactosidase plasmid or in combination with Smad3 exhibited such a phenotype (Fig. 3 A). However, coexpression of Smad3 along with DPC4 resulted in a dramatic decrease in blue cell number, suggesting that Smad3 may act in partnership with DPC4 to trigger cell death (Fig. 3 A). A similar conclusion could be drawn when the experiments were performed using the TUNEL detection method (Fig. 3 B). In addition to morphological changes, the effects of DPC4 and Smad3 on apoptosis were associated with a marked increase in nuclear DNA fragmentation, because apoptosis is frequently accompanied by the cleavage of DNA at internucleosomal sites, which results in a distinct laddering pattern when analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis (Fig. 3 B). Collectively, these data provide the first demonstration that DPC4 and Smad3 together may function in a cooperative way to induce cell death. Signaling by TGFβ family members is now relatively well understood at the level of receptor activation, and the diverse biological responses are becoming increasingly well characterized in terms of gene targets that are regulated by these signaling pathways (1Massagué J.

The findings outlined in the present study provide molecular evidence that the activation of SAPK/JNK signaling pathways is required for the function of Smad proteins. The molecular framework that we proposed gives rise to a number of areas for future study, including the identification of downstream targets of DPC4 and Smad3 and to determine how these targets are regulated to initiate TGFβ responses and apoptotic cell death.

https://openalex.org/W2092560671,"Since there is no consensus sequence directing the initial GalNAc incorporation into mucin peptides,O-glycosylation sites are not reliably predictable. We have developed a mass spectrometric sequencing strategy that allows the identification of in vivo O-glycosylation sites on mucin-derived glycopeptides. Lactation-associated MUC1 was isolated from human milk and partially deglycosylated by trifluoromethanesulfonic acid to the level of core GalNAc residues. The product was fragmented by the Arg-C-specific endopeptidase clostripain to yield tandem repeat icosapeptides starting with the PAP motif. PAP20 glycopeptides were subjected to sequencing by post-source decay matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization mass spectrometry or by solid phase Edman degradation to localize the glycosylation sites. The masses of C- or N-terminal fragments registered for the mono- to pentasubstituted PAP20 indicated that GalNAc was linked to the peptide at Ser5,Thr6 (GSTA) and Thr14(VTSA) but contrary to previous in vitro glycosylation studies also at Thr19 and Ser15 located within the PDTR or VTSA motifs, respectively. Quantitative data from solid phase Edman sequencing revealed no preferential glycosylation of the threonines. These discrepancies between in vivo andin vitro glycosylation patterns may be explained by assuming that O-glycosylation of adjacent peptide positions is a dynamically regulated process that depends on changes of the substrate qualities induced by glycosylation at vicinal sites.

Post-translational modification of proteins by glycosylation has extensively been studied in the case of N-linked glycans, and accordingly, rules for the substitution of asparagine residues by dolichol phosphate-linked glycans are well established (1Bause E. Biochem. J. 1983; 209: 331-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar). WhileN-glycosylation is directed by the consensus peptide motif Asn-X-(Ser/Thr), no strict sequence dependence is known for the initiation of O-glycosylation. Currently, there are several approaches to the identification of O-glycosylation sites: studies on in vitro O-glycosylation of synthetic peptides (2O'Connell B.C. Tabak L.A. Ramusubbu N. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 180: 1024-1030Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 3Wang Y. Abernethy J.L. Eckhardt A.E. Hill R.L. J. Biol.

Glycobiology. 1993; 3: 429-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 6Pisano A. Packer N.H. Redmond J.W. Williams K.L. Gooley A.A.

Glycobiology. 1994; 4: 413-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The results obtained so far agree with the statement that there are no clear-cut motifs for the addition of GalNAc at Ser or Thr residues; however, the non-random patterns ofO-glycosylation suggest influences of flanking sequences (2O'Connell B.C. Tabak L.A. Ramusubbu N. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 180: 1024-1030Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Wang et al. (3Wang Y. Abernethy J.L. Eckhardt A.E. Hill R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12709-12716Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) proposed different motifs for threonine and serine glycosylation, and the studies of O‘Connell et al. (2O'Connell B.C. Tabak L.A. Ramusubbu N. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 180: 1024-1030Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) revealed critical positions in the vicinity of putativeO-glycosylation sites. The obviously less specific GalNAc addition to Ser/Thr residues compared with N-glycosylation is reflected also in the existence of at least four distinct species of UDP-GalNAc/peptide N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase(s) (GalNAc-transferase) for which different substrate specificities have been established (9Clausen H. Bennett E.P. Glycobiology. 1996; 6: 635-646Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). Accordingly, the differentiation and organ localization of a cell should determine its characteristic equipment of active GalNAc-transferases (T1–T4) and, hence, the site-specificO-glycosylation of proteins processed within this cell. Site specificity of O-glycosylation strongly affects the antigenicity of a protein as has been revealed for the highly immunogenic peptide motif PDTR within MUC1 tandem repeats (10Spencer D.I.R. Price M.R. Tendler S.J.B. DeMatteis C.I. Stadie T. Hanisch F.-G. Cancer Lett. 1996; 100: 11-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Most antibodies reactive to the PDTR sequence are more or less influenced by GalNAc incorporation into threonine residues of the flanking motifs VTSA and GSTA by showing a significant enhancement or decrease of their binding activities (10Spencer D.I.R.

Epithelial Cell Biol. 1993; 2: 155-162PubMed Google Scholar). In vitro studies have established that preferentially Thr residues within VTSA and GSTA are glycosylated (12Nishimori I. Johnson N.R.

(1997)Glycobiology, in pressGoogle Scholar), whereas only Ser within GSTA serves as a substrate to a minor degree (14Stadie T.R.E. Chai W. Lawson A.M. Byfield P.G.H. Hanisch F.-G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 229: 140-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 15Goletz, S., Thiede, B., Hanisch, F.-G., Peter-Katalinic, J., Schultz, M., Müller, S., Seitz, O., and Karsten, U. (1997)Glycobiology, in pressGoogle Scholar). To establish the actual sites of O-glycosylation on thein vivo processed mucin, we have applied a mass spectrometric sequencing strategy (15Goletz, S., Thiede, B., Hanisch, F.-G., Peter-Katalinic, J., Schultz, M., Müller, S., Seitz, O., and Karsten, U. (1997)Glycobiology, in pressGoogle Scholar) using the MUC1 glycoform in human milk as a model. A fragmentation of the highly glycosylated mucin by specific endopeptidases becomes possible only after a limited deglycosylation with trifluoromethanesulfonic acid (TFMSA). 1The abbreviations used are: TFMSA, trifluoromethanesulfonic acid; HexNAc, N-acetylhexosamine; HMFGM, human milk fat globule membrane; PSD-MALDI-(TOF)-MS, post-source decay matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization mass spectrometry; RP-HPLC, reversed phase-high performance liquid chromatography; PTH, phenylthiohydantoin; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; mAb, monoclonal antibody; BSA, bovine serum albumin; ACN, acetonitrile. This treatment is reported to result in the removal of complex carbohydrates, but to leave during short reaction times a considerable portion of the core GalNAc residues intact (16Sojar H.T. Bahl O.M.P. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1987; 259: 52-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 17Gerken T.A. Gupta R. Jentoft N. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 639-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). This partially deglycosylated mucin (GalNAc-MUC1) can be effectively fragmented by clostripain cleaving at Arg-C (18Aitken A. Geisow M.J. Findley J.B.C. Holmes C. Yarwood A. Findley J.B.C. Geisolo M.J. Protein Sequencing: A Practical Approach. IRL Press at Oxford University Press, Oxford1989: 43-68Google Scholar). Clostripain fragmentation of the tandem repeat peptide results in a series of differentially glycosylated icosapeptides PAP20 as shown in Sequence 1:PDTR‖CPAPGSTAPPAHGVTSAPDTRPAP20‖CPAPGSTAPPASEQUENCE1As demonstrated previously for a series of in vitroglycosylated peptides corresponding to the MUC1 tandem repeats (TAP25) (15Goletz, S., Thiede, B., Hanisch, F.-G., Peter-Katalinic, J., Schultz, M., Müller, S., Seitz, O., and Karsten, U. (1997)Glycobiology, in pressGoogle Scholar), the sequencing of PAP20 peptides was possible by mass spectrometric analysis of post-source decay fragments in a MALDI-TOF instrument. Independent evidence for the localization ofO-glycosylation sites and, moreover, quantitative estimations of the degree of glycosylation at each site were obtained from solid phase Edman sequencing. The results obtained suggest thatin vitro data should be carefully reevaluated by the analysis of in vivo processed glycoprotein and that a prediction of O-glycosylation sites cannot be based solely on peptide sequence. Human milk was obtained from healthy women during days 2–5 of lactation and immediately frozen at −20 °C. Milk samples from multiple donors were thawed at 4 °C and combined, and milk fat was separated from skim milk by centrifugation at 3,000 × g (4 °C) for 1 h (Fig. 1). Secretory MUC1 from skim milk was isolated by extraction with hot phenol and subsequent gel filtration on Sephacryl S300 as described previously (19Hanisch F.-G. Uhlenbruck G. Peter-Katalinic J. Egge H. Dabrowski J. Dabrowski U. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 872-883Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). This preparation is designated MUC1(skim milk). Milk fat was used for the preparation of human milk fat globule membranes (HMFGM) according to the procedure of Shimidzu and Yamauchi (20Shimidzu M. Yamauchi K. J. Biochem. ( Tokyo ). 1982; 91: 515-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). For the isolation of membrane-associated MUC1, the HMFGM were homogenized and sonicated in 0.45 mm sodium phosphate, 125 mm sodium chloride, pH 7.2 (PBS), containing 4 m urea, before they were extracted with an equal volume of 90% phenol for 30 min at 65 °C. The extract was allowed to cool to room temperature; 0.5 volumes of chloroform were added, and the phases were separated by centrifugation at 30,000 × g (10 °C) for 30 min. The aqueous phase was dialyzed against several changes of demineralized water, concentrated by ultrafiltration, and applied to a column (2.5 × 100 cm) of Sephacryl S300 equilibrated in PBS. Fractions were analyzed by colorimetric microassays for hexoses (21Monsigny M. Petit C. Roche A.-C. Anal. Biochem. 1988; 175: 525-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar) and sialic acid (22Bhavanandan V.P. Sheykhnazari M. Anal. Biochem. 1993; 213: 438-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) and in an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay with monoclonal antibody BW835. The combined void fractions, containing the mucin, were extensively dialyzed against demineralized water, concentrated by ultrafiltration, and freeze-dried. This preparation is designated MUC1(HMFGM). SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoretic separations of mucin samples were carried out in the Mini Protean II gel electrophoresis apparatus (Bio-Rad, München, Germany) according to the method of Laemmli. Gradient gels (3–15%), overlaid with a 3% stacking gel, were run at 200-V constant voltage for 50 min and stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250. In addition, gels were blotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes using a semi-dry blotting apparatus and the buffer system of Towbin et al. (23Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44924) Google Scholar). Remaining protein binding sites were blocked with 3% BSA in PBS (1 h, room temperature), and mucin was detected by an overnight incubation with mAb BW835 (Behringwerke, Marburg, Germany, 2 μg/ml in 0.5% BSA in PBS) followed by 1-h incubations with biotinylated goat anti-mouse immunoglobulin serum (E 413, Dako, 1:5,000 in 0.5% BSA in PBS) and avidin-conjugated alkaline phosphatase (Boehringer Mannheim, 1:2,500 in 0.5% BSA in PBS) using nitro blue tetrazolium/5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indoyl phosphate as substrate. Alternatively, blotted glycoproteins were detected after oxidation with sodium periodate according to the method of O'Shannessy et al. (24O‘Shannassy D.J. Voorstad P.L. Quarles R.H. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 163: 204-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). MUC1(skim milk) or MUC1(HMFGM) were deglycosylated by treatment with anhydrous TFMSA (Sigma, Unterhaching, Germany) in the absence (16Sojar H.T. Bahl O.M.P. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1987; 259: 52-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) or presence of anisole (17Gerken T.A. Gupta R. Jentoft N. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 639-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2). Lyophilized mucin was resuspended in 0.1 m hydrochloric acid at 4 mg/ml and heated at 70 °C for 60 min to hydrolyze sialic acids. Hydrochloric acid was removed by dialysis against demineralized water. Following the method of Sojar and Bahl aliquots corresponding to 0.1–8 mg of native mucin were lyophilized in Teflon-lined screw-cap vials, flushed with argon, and precooled on ice, before 0.2–0.4 ml of TFMSA (−20 °C) were added for each milligram of mucin. The tubes were flushed with argon once more and then immediately closed and incubated on ice for the appropriate time. The reaction was stopped by cooling the tubes on dry ice in methanol and slowly adding 3 volumes of ice-cold 60% pyridine/water. Finally, the deglycosylated samples were dialyzed against several changes of buffer, appropriate for the following manipulations, and stored frozen at −20 °C. The method of Gerkenet al. (17Gerken T.A. Gupta R. Jentoft N. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 639-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) was followed as described. The time course of N-acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc) exposure during removal of complex glycans by TFMSA treatment was followed by kinetic analysis (Fig. 2). 0.1 mg of MUC1(HMFGM) was desialylated and treated with TFMSA for 0, 15, 30, and 60 min in the absence of anisole or for 0, 1, 2, and 6 h in the presence of anisole. After neutralization the samples were diluted with 50 mmNH4HCO3, pH 8.0, and chromatographed on Superdex 75pg (1 × 20 cm) using the same buffer as eluant and a flow rate of 0.4 ml/min. The samples were analyzed by quantitative monosaccharide composition analysis (see below) or by Helix pomatia agglutinin binding to follow the time course of the sugar removal and the immunochemical accessibility of exposed GalNAc. Samples were diluted 1:16 in 0.1 m sodium carbonate, pH 9.6, and 50 μl of a serial 1:2 dilution in the same buffer were bound to 96-well polystyrene plates by drying in a desiccator. Remaining protein binding sites were blocked with 3% BSA in PBS at 37 °C for 1 h, and the plate was incubated with 50 μl of a 2 μg/ml solution of biotinylated H. pomatia agglutinin (Sigma) in 0.5% BSA in PBS at 37 °C for 1 h. Bound lectin was detected with avidin-alkaline phosphatase (Boehringer Mannheim, Germany, 1:2,500 in 0.5% BSA in PBS) using p-nitrophenyl phosphate as substrate. Amino sugars in the deglycosylated samples were analyzed as peracetylated alditols using gas chromatography/electron impact mass spectrometry (Fison MD800) in the scan mode. 100 μl (20%) of the dialyzed samples and 2 μg ofmeso-erythritol were lyophilized in micro-reaction vials and hydrolyzed with 4 n hydrochloric acid for 18 h at 100 °C. Subsequent reduction and peracetylation of monosaccharides was performed as described elsewhere (25Merkle R.K. Poppe I. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 230: 1-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). To analyze total monosaccharides in the deglycosylated and gel-filtrated samples per-O-trimethylsilyl,1-O-methyl esters were prepared according to the method of Chaplin and Kennedy (26Chaplin M.F. Kennedy J.F. Carbohydrate Analysis: A Practical Approach. IRL Press at Oxford University Press, Oxford1986Google Scholar). Gas chromatography of peracetylated alditols was performed on a DB5ms capillary (J & W Scientific, 0.25 mm × 15 m). Splitless sample injection (200 °C) was used. The capillary temperature was held constant at 50 °C for 1 min, raised to 120 °C with 30 °C/min, and then to 260 °C with 7.5 °C/min. The same capillary was used for the analysis of per-O-trimethylsilyl,1-O-methyl esters. The temperature was kept at 100 °C for 1 min and then raised to 280 °C with 7.5 °C/min. On-line mass spectrometry was performed with electron impact ionization at 70 eV in the positive mode. Mass spectra were recorded in the range from 50 to 500 mass units. A synthetic glycopeptide GPT-(GlcNAcβ1–6GalNAcα)-TTPITT (kindly provided by Prof. H. Paulsen, Institute of Organic Chemistry, University of Hamburg) or partially deglycosylated MUC1 were treated with 50 mm NaOH, 1 m NaBH4 for 16 h at 50 °C, and after destruction of the excess borohydride with dilute acetic acid the reductively β-eliminated alditols were desalted on Dowex 50WX8, followed by removal of borate as its methyl ester, extensive drying and permethylation as described (19Hanisch F.-G. Uhlenbruck G. Peter-Katalinic J. Egge H. Dabrowski J. Dabrowski U. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 872-883Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Gas-chromatography/mass spectrometry of methylated dihexosamine alditols was performed on an MD800 (Fisons). The samples were solubilized in chloroform and injected onto a DB5 capillary column (15 m), which was heated from 100 to 300 °C at 10 °C/min followed by isothermic elution at 300 °C for 10 min. Mass spectra were recorded in cyclic scans from m/z 100 to 800. Three aliquots corresponding to 8 mg of native mucin were desialylated and treated with TFMSA according to Sojar and Bahl (16Sojar H.T. Bahl O.M.P. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1987; 259: 52-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) for 20 min (P1), 30 min (P3), or 60 min (P2) (Fig. 1). The neutralized samples were dialyzed into 25 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.5; 0.2 mm calcium acetate and concentrated by ultrafiltration. 0.5 ml (50%) of the concentrated samples (8 mg/ml) were supplemented with 2.5 mm dithiothreitol, and proteolytic digestion was performed by adding 120 μg of clostripain (1 mg/ml in 2.5 mm dithiothreitol, 2 mm calcium acetate, activated at room temperature for 3 h) and incubating at 37 °C for 24 h. An aliquot of the digest was chromatographed on Superdex 75pg (1 × 20 cm) in 50 mm sodium phosphate, 500 mm NaCl, pH 7.0. Elution of mucin/glycopeptides was registered at 214 nm, and aliquots of the fractionated eluate were measured for MUC1 peptide epitopes (see below). The column had been calibrated with a mixture of synthetic MUC1 tandem repeat oligomers (kindly provided by Dr. J. Hilgers, Free University Hospital, Amsterdam). Digested partially deglycosylated mucin samples were cleared by centrifugation for 5 min at 15,000 × g and separated by reversed phase-HPLC on a 250 × 4.6 mm PLRP-S column (Polymer Laboratories) (Fig. 1 and Fig.3). The samples were injected as 5 × 100-μl aliquots, and the column was eluted at a flow rate of 1 ml/min using a linear gradient from 2% (v/v) acetonitrile (ACN) in 0.1%(v/v) trifluoroacetic acid (solvent A) to 80% (v/v) ACN in 0.09% (v/v) (solvent B) during 80 min. Peaks were detected at 214 nm, and 1-ml fractions were collected. 10 μl of each fraction were used for immunochemical detection with a mixture of the MUC1-specific mAbs BC3 and VA1 (see “Immunochemical Procedures”). Immunoreactive fractions (19–25 and 26–30 min) were combined, lyophilized in a speed vac, and rechromatographed on a 250 × 2.1 mm C18 column (Vydac) using a flow rate of 0.25 ml/min and a gradient of 0–100% solvent B during 100 min (P1, P2). Rechromatography of P3 glycopeptides was performed with a flow rate of 0.3 ml/min and a gradient from 0 to 100% during 80 min. 0.3-ml fractions were collected, and 5 μl were used for immunochemical detection as described above. Immunoreactive fractions were lyophilized in a speed vac and used for matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-mass spectrometry (MALDI-MS) or Edman sequencing (Fig. 1). The monoclonal antibodies BC3 and VA1 are directed against peptide epitopes within the MUC1 tandem repeat sequence and were kindly provided by Dr. Ian McKenzie (Austin Research Institute, Heidelberg, Australia). BW835 (Behringwerke, Marburg, Germany) is specific for exposed core 1 disaccharide within a peptide motif of the MUC1 tandem repeat sequence (27Hanisch F.-G. Stadie T. Boβlet K. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 4036-4040PubMed Google Scholar). Samples were immobilized onto 96-well polystyrene plates (Nunc, Wiesbaden, Germany), and bound antibodies were quantified by alternating incubations with polyclonal anti-mouse immunoglobulin (Z 259, Dako, Hamburg, Germany) and a complex of alkaline phosphatase/anti-alkaline phosphatase, as described previously (27Hanisch F.-G. Stadie T. Boβlet K. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 4036-4040PubMed Google Scholar). The matrix CCA (α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid; saturated solution in 2/3 aqueous 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, 1/3 acetonitrile) was mixed 1:1 (v/v) with the probe in 50% methanol, placed (0.7–0.8 μl) onto a polished stainless steel target, and air-dried. Linear, reflectron, and PSD mass spectrometric analyses were performed with a MALDI-TOF instrument (Bruker-Reflex, Bruker-Franzen Analytic, Bremen, Germany) (15Goletz, S., Thiede, B., Hanisch, F.-G., Peter-Katalinic, J., Schultz, M., Müller, S., Seitz, O., and Karsten, U. (1997)Glycobiology, in pressGoogle Scholar) using a pulsed UV laser beam (nitrogen laser, λ = 337 nm). Irradiance was slightly above the threshold of ion detection. Residual gas pressure was at 0.8 × 10−7 × 10−7 mbar. Ion spectra were obtained in the positive ion mode. Acceleration and reflector voltages were set to 28.5 and 30 kV, respectively. The molecular parent ion was isolated with a pulsed field by deflection of all other ions (precursor selection). Complete PSD fragment ion spectra were obtained by stepwise reducing the reflector voltage to produce overlapping mass ranges, combination of the part spectra, and calibration according to the manufacturer's recommendations. No smoothing or filtering was applied to the shown spectra. Glycopeptides were sequenced on a HPJ000G with 3.1 chemistry and a biphasic sequencing column or after covalent attachment to Sequelon AATM membranes on a Beckman GlycoSite sequenator according to previously published procedures (6Pisano A. Packer N.H. Redmond J.W. Williams K.L. Gooley A.A. Glycobiology. 1995; 4: 837-844Crossref Scopus (84) Google Scholar,28Pisano A. Jadine D.R. Packer N.H. Redmond J.W. Williams K.L. Gooley A.A. Farnsworth V. Carson W. Cartier P.K. Townsend R. Hotchkiss A. Techniques in Glycobiology. Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York1997: 299-320Google Scholar). Quantitation of the serine/threonine HexNAc substitution was calculated using a glycopeptide derived from the Dictyostelium discoideum recombinant expressed glycoprotein PsA, which contains a 100% substituted GlcNAcβ-Thr in position 4. The corrected yield for this cycle (repetitive yield for the glycopeptide ITATPAPT) was 95%. The migration behavior of GlcNAcβ-Thr is almost identical to the corresponding GalNAcα derivative on reversed phase-HPLC (see also Refs. 6Pisano A. Packer N.H. Redmond J.W. Williams K.L. Gooley A.A.

A detailed description of the purification procedure and the chemical characterization of MUC1 from human skim milk is given in Refs. 19Hanisch F.-G. Uhlenbruck G. Peter-Katalinic J. Egge H.

Biochem. 1985; 149: 323-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar. The yield of MUC1(skim milk) we obtained in the present study was 50 mg/1 liter of defatted milk. For MUC1(HMFGM) the total yield was 7 mg calculated for 100 g of wet milk fat. Quality and homogeneity of both preparations were checked by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis with 10 μg of mucin/lane and subsequent electroblotting, followed by the glycoprotein staining procedure of O'Shannessy or immunochemical detection with the MUC1-specific mAb BW835. For both mucin preparations the glycoprotein stain revealed a single, broad band that hardly entered the 3–15% gel and that was isographic with the single band obtained by staining Western blots with mAb BW835. These data confirm that MUC1 is the major component in both mucin preparations and demonstrate the absence of detectable amounts of contaminating glycoproteins. In addition, there were no visible bands after staining the gels (100 μg mucin/lane) with Coomassie R-250, indicating that MUC1(skim milk) as well as MUC1(HMFGM) were almost free of non-glycosylated protein. Although treatment with anhydrous TFMSA is generally regarded as an efficient method for the deglycosylation of proteins (16Sojar H.T. Bahl O.M.P. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1987; 259: 52-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 17Gerken T.A. Gupta R. Jentoft N. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 639-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), it leaves a significant amount of the peptide-linked GalNAc uncleaved, when used for limited incubation times at 0 °C (16Sojar H.T. Bahl O.M.P. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1987; 259: 52-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 17Gerken T.A. Gupta R. Jentoft N. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 639-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). We took advantage of this fact by using residual core GalNAc as a marker forO-glycosylation sites. Kinetic studies were performed to find conditions where removal of peripheral saccharides was quantitative and the loss of peptide-linked GalNAc could be neglected. Because the presence of GalNAc in MUC1-linked O-glycans is restricted to peptide-linked positions in core 1 (minor) or core 2 (major) structures (19Hanisch F.-G. Uhlenbruck G. Peter-Katalinic J. Egge H. Dabrowski J. Dabrowski U. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 872-883Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), 2W. Chai, A. M. Lawson, and F.-G. Hanisch, unpublished results., the amount of GalNAc residues and the ratio of GlcNAc/GalNAc, as measured by quantitative monosaccharide analysis, should give a good estimation of the proceeding deglycosylation reaction. In the absence of anisole the removal of complex glycans and the chain truncation to the level of core GalNAc proceeded within 60 min (Fig. 2 A). Extension of the incubation times over 60 min resulted in substantial losses of the core GalNAc residues which was also reflected in a decreased H. pomatia agglutinin-binding rate (data not shown). On the contrary, deglycosylation in the presence of anisole resulted in decreased reaction rates, and even after prolonged incubation times up to 6 h the residual GlcNAc was detected at 60% relative to the untreated sample (Fig. 2 B). The length of the polylactosamine-type chains on lactation-associated MUC1 and evidence that indicates a stepwise deglycosylation process from the non-reducing terminus of the glycans (17Gerken T.A. Gupta R. Jentoft N. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 639-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) could explain this observation. On the basis of these quantitative kinetic data the method of Sojar and Bahl (16Sojar H.T. Bahl O.M.P. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1987; 259: 52-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) was preferred for the preparation of MUC1-derived glycopeptides. As measured by quantitative hexosamine analysis, the content of GalNAc during TFMSA treatments up to 30 min decreased only to 86%, while the GlcNAc content during the same period dropped below 2% (Fig. 2 A). The low amounts of GlcNAc relative"

Removal of the host cell heparan sulfate results in a significantly diminished susceptibility of the cell to virus infection. On the virus envelope, glycoprotein C has been identified as the major binding site for heparan sulfate in the primary attachment of the virus to host cells. Using selectively desulfated heparins and metabolically labeled host cell heparan sulfate, we have analyzed the structural requirements of heparan sulfate to provide binding sites for glycoprotein C and the whole virus. Employing glycoprotein C affinity chromatography and a virus binding assay, we subfractionated oligosaccharides derived from heparan sulfate and partially desulfated heparin into selectively bound and unbound pools. These were chemically depolymerized and analyzed at the disaccharide level. The shortest glycoprotein C-binding fragment consisted of 10–12 monosaccharide units containing at least one 2-O- and one 6-O-sulfate group that have to be localized in a sequence-specific way, based on the finding that bound and unbound HS fragments do not differ in charge or composition. The binding sequence is found within N-sulfated blocks of heparan sulfate, although several N-acetyl groups can be tolerated within the minimal binding sequence.

Spear P.G. N. Engl. J. Med. 1986; 314 (, 749–757): 686-691Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar). The first step in viral infection is the attachment to the host cell that enables the virus to penetrate into the cell. Heparan sulfate (HS) on the host cell surface has been implicated in the adherence of numerous microbial agents (2Rostand K.S. Esko J.D. Infect. Immun. 1997; 65: 1-8Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) including human immunodeficiency virus (3Patel M. Yanagishita M. Roderiquez G. Bou Habib D.C. Oravecz T. Hascall V.C. Norcross M.A. AIDS Res. Hum. Retroviruses. 1993; 9: 167-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar), HSV-1 and HSV-2 (4Lycke E. Johansson M. Svennerholm B. Lindahl U. J. Gen. Virol. 1991; 72: 1131-1137Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 5Shieh M.T. WuDunn D. Montgomery R.I. Esko J.D. Spear P.G. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 116: 1273-1281Crossref PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar). That HS chains act as receptors for HSV-1 was demonstrated by inhibition of attachment to and infection of cells through exogenously added heparin (6WuDunn D. Spear P.G. J. Virol. 1989; 63: 52-58Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and by the finding that HSV-1 attaches poorly to HS-deficient mutant Chinese hamster ovary cells (5Shieh M.T. WuDunn D. Montgomery R.I. Esko J.D. Spear P.G. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 116: 1273-1281Crossref PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar). Earlier work has shown that the interaction occurs via binding of HSV-1 envelope glycoproteins to cell surface HS. Studies with HSV-1 strains devoid of specific glycoproteins have revealed that glycoprotein C (gC) is the major mediator of the virus attachment (7Herold B.C. WuDunn D. Soltys N. Spear P.G. J. Virol. 1991; 65: 1090-1098Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). gC is a 120-kDa glycoprotein that is conserved within the simplex virus genus (8Spear P.G. Semin. Virol. 1993; 4: 167-180Crossref Scopus (335) Google Scholar). Using synthetic peptides, it was previously shown that a cluster of basic amino acids (Arg-143, Arg-145, and Arg-147) as well as Gly-247, located in separate regions of the primary sequence of gC, are essential for the interaction (9Trybala E. Bergström T. Svennerholm B. Jeansson S. Glorioso J.C. Olofsson S. J. Gen. Virol. 1994; 75: 743-752Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Besides gC, another HSV-1 glycoprotein designated gB, which is involved in virus penetration into the cell, also binds heparin (7Herold B.C. WuDunn D. Soltys N. Spear P.G. J. Virol. 1991; 65: 1090-1098Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, it is not known whether gB-HS interaction does indeed occur in wild-type gC positive HSV-1 nor if such binding would occur subsequent or simultaneous to gC-HS interaction (10Herold B.C. Visalli R.J. Susmarski N. Brandt C.R. Spear P.G. J. Gen. Virol. 1994; 75: 1211-1222Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). Heparin and the closely related polysaccharide HS are glycosaminoglycans (GAGs). They are synthesized as proteoglycans that consist of GAG chains covalently bound to a protein core. The backbone of a GAG moiety consists of alternating hexuronic acid and hexosamine units. In heparin and HS, the hexuronic acid (HexA) can be eitherd-glucuronic acid (GlcA) or its C-5 epimerl-iduronic acid (IdceA), whereas the hexosamine is invariably glucosamine (GlcN) (for review see Refs. 11Kjellén L. Lindahl U. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1991; 60: 443-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (1680) Google Scholar and 12Salmivirta M. Lidholt K. Lindahl U. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 1270-1279Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar). The backbone is modified by N- and O-sulfation at various positions. Due to the more extended modification during its biosynthesis, heparin contains more IdceA and is more evenly and extensively sulfated than HS which is composed of less sulfated or non-sulfated blocks interspersed by highly sulfated sequences. Furthermore, HS is ubiquitous in the extracellular matrix and on the plasma membrane of most cells, whereas heparin is confined to connective tissue mast cells. Due to their negative charge heparin and HS interact with a variety of proteins such as cytokines, extracellular matrix proteins, enzymes, and enzyme inhibitors, sometimes with drastic effects on the biological activities of the bound proteins (12Salmivirta M. Lidholt K. Lindahl U. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 1270-1279Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar). Due to its inhibitory effect on HSV-1 infection, heparin is a potential candidate for an antiviral agent. To minimize cross-reactivity with other proteins, it would be important to define the minimal structural requirements for binding to HSV-1. As gC is the major mediator of the virus attachment step, an oligosaccharide capable of binding gC should have an inhibitory effect on HSV-1 infection related to that of native heparin. Earlier in vitro studies have shown that HSV-1 infection can be inhibited by a heparin oligomer consisting of 10–12 monosaccharide units (4Lycke E. Johansson M. Svennerholm B. Lindahl U. J. Gen. Virol. 1991; 72: 1131-1137Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). A more recent study implicated a variety of sulfate groups in the binding of heparin to HSV-1 (13Herold B.C. Gerber S.I. Polonsky T. Belval B.J. Shaklee P.N. Holme K. Virology. 1995; 206: 1108-1116Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). However, there is no information regarding the fine structure of gC/HSV-1 binding domains in HS. The current study was undertaken to define a minimally sulfated oligosaccharide capable of binding gC and HSV-1. Sephadex G-15, prepacked PD-10 columns, DEAE-Sephacel, Superose 12, CH-Sepharose CL4B affinity matrix, and a fast performance liquid chromatography column of Superdex 30 were obtained from Pharmacia-Upjohn (Uppsala, Sweden). Bio-Gel P-10 was from Bio-Rad (Sundbyberg, Sweden). Carrier-free Na235SO4 (1200–1400 Ci/mmol) was purchased from NEN Life Science Products. [3H]Glucosamine (26 Ci/mmol) and NaB3H4 (24–28 Ci/mmol) were obtained from Amersham Corp. (Solna, Sweden). Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and fetal calf serum (FCS) were purchased from Statens Veterinärmedicinska Anstalt (Uppsala, Sweden). Eagle's minimum essential medium (EMEM) was from Life Technologies, Inc. (Life Technologies, Täby, Sweden) and primaton RL substance was obtained from Kraft Inc. (Norwich, CO). Nitrocellulose filters were purchased from Sartorius AG (Goettingen, Germany). Whatman 3MM paper and Partisil-10 SAX (4.6 × 250 mm) columns were purchased from Whatman Inc. (Clifton, NJ). Hydrazine hydrate was obtained from Fluka Chemie AG (Buchs, Switzerland). Hydrazine sulfate was purchased from Merck (Darmstadt, Germany). Chondroitin sulfate, 4-sulfated from bovine nasal cartilage and preferentially 6-sulfated from bovine tracheal cartilage were gifts from Dr. Anders Malmström (University of Lund, Sweden) and were N-[3H]acetyl-labeled as described (14Höök M. Riesenfeld J. Lindahl U. Anal. Biochem. 1982; 119: 236-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). All other reagents were of best quality available. Clone AH1 derived from African green monkey kidney cells (referred to as GMK cells) were cultivated in EMEM supplemented with 2% FCS and 0.05% of primaton RL substance. The HSV-1 strain used was KOS 321, a plaque-purified isolate of wild-type strain KOS (15Holland T.C. Marlin S.D. Levine M. Glorioso J. J. Virol. 1983; 45: 672-682Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) (referred to as HSV-1). Roller bottles with confluent monolayers of GMK cells were infected with HSV-1 at high multiplicity and harvested after 48–72 h. Cells were resuspended in the lysis buffer (0.02m Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing 1% sodium deoxycholate, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm EDTA, and 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride or 4-(2-aminoethyl)-benzenesulfonyl fluoride. The mixture was homogenized with several strokes of a Dounce homogenizer and kept on ice for 1 h. After centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 1 h, the supernatant was subjected to repeated immunosorbent purification. In a first step, a Sepharose column coupled with the mAb B1E6A5 (16Olofsson S. Sjöblom I. Lundström M. Jeansson S. Lycke E. J. Gen. Virol. 1983; 64: 2735-2747Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) was used to remove glycoprotein E. The flow-through fraction was applied to a Sepharose column coupled with the HSV-1 gC-specific mAb B1C1B4 (17Bergström T. Sjögren-Jansson E. Jeansson S. Lycke E. Mol. Cell. Probes. 1992; 6: 41-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Subsequently, the column was washed with 0.02 Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing 0.5 m NaCl and 0.1% Nonidet P-40 and then with the same buffer without any detergent. gC was eluted with 0.1m glycine HCl, pH 2.4, and neutralized with 1 mTris-HCl, pH 8.0. The fractions of the eluate giving the highest reactivity with the mAb B1C1B4 were collected and dialyzed against Tris-buffered saline (TBS, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 130 mm NaCl). GMK cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium supplemented with 0.05% primaton RL substance, 2.5% FCS, 1% glutamine and penicillin (60 μg/ml) and streptomycin (50 μg/ml). For metabolic labeling, 100 μCi/ml 35SO4 or 20 μCi/ml [3H]GlcN were added to the confluent cultures in sulfate-free and normal medium, respectively. After 24 h, medium was removed, and cells were scraped off in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, 8.1 mm Na2HPO4, 1.5 mm KH2PO4, 2.7 mm KCl, 140 mm NaCl, pH 7.4). Radiolabeled HS from cell and medium fraction was isolated as described (18Feyzi E. Lustig F. Fager G. Spillmann D. Lindahl U. Salmivirta M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5518-5524Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Heparin from pig intestinal mucosa (stage 14, Inolex Pharmaceutical Division, Park Forest South, IL) was purified by repeated precipitation with cetylpyridinium chloride from 1.2 m NaCl (19Lindahl U. Cifonelli J.A. Lindahl B. Rodén L. J. Biol. Chem. 1965; 240: 2817-2820Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and radiolabeled by3H-acetylating free amino groups (14Höök M. Riesenfeld J. Lindahl U. Anal. Biochem. 1982; 119: 236-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Heparin from bovine lung (The Upjohn Co.) was purified in a similar way and used for generation of desulfated heparins. Heparin was 2-O-desulfated by lyophilization at pH 12.5 (20Jaseja M. Rej R.N. Sauriol F. Perlin A.S. Can. J. Chem. 1989; 67: 1449-1457Crossref Scopus (139) Google Scholar) andN-resulfated as described below. Preferentially 6-O-desulfated heparin was prepared by treatment of the native heparin with dimethyl sulfoxide/methanol (9/1, v/v) at the indicated temperature (see Table I) (21Inoue Y. Nagasawa K. Carbohydr. Res. 1976; 46: 87-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). The samples, which were completely N-desulfated due to this procedure, were then either N-resulfated or N-acetylated.N-Desulfation was performed by treatment of heparin with dimethyl sulfoxide/H2O (19/1, v/v) for 90 min at 50 °C (21Inoue Y. Nagasawa K. Carbohydr. Res. 1976; 46: 87-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). To prepare a partiallyN-desulfated/N-acetylated heparin 12-mer,3H-end-labeled heparin 12-mer was subjected to the sameN-desulfation treatment for 60 min. N-Acetylation was performed by adding acetic anhydride to the desulfated heparins in ice-cold Na2CO3 as described (22Danishefsky I. Steiner H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1965; 101: 37-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar).N-Resulfation was carried out by incubation of 20 mg of desulfated heparin with 20 mg of trimethylamine/sulfur trioxide (Aldrich, Steinheim, Germany) in 400 μl of 50 mmNa2CO3 at 55 °C for 1 h. An equal aliquot of reagent was added and the incubation was continued for 24 h. The reaction was terminated by dilution with water, and the sample was extensively dialyzed against water (23Lloyd A.G. Embery G. Fowler L.J. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1971; 20: 637-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar).Table ICompositional analysis of modified heparin preparationsPreparation characteristics1-aBovine lung heparin was selectively modified as described under “Materials and Methods.” The characteristics of the individual resultant preparations are indicated in relation to the parent native heparin.Treatment of native heparin1-bIndicates the procedures required to create the respective preparation.Sulfate groups/disaccharide unit1-cAverage number of sulfate groups per single disaccharide unit as calculated from compositional analysis.Distribution of sulfate groups1-dCalculated from compositional analysis.

Open table in a new tab Heparin oligosaccharides of defined length were prepared as described (24Pejler G. Danielsson Å. Björk I. Lindahl U. Nader H.B. Dietrich C.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 11413-11421Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, native or modified bovine lung heparin was cleaved by limited treatment with nitrous acid at pH 1.5 (native and 2-O-desulfated heparin) or at pH 4 to cleave at the unsubstituted amino groups (preferentially 6-O-desulfated heparin) (25Shively J.E. Conrad H.E. Biochemistry. 1976; 15: 3932-3942Crossref PubMed Scopus (667) Google Scholar). The fragments were radiolabeled by reduction with NaB3H4 (26Maccarana M. Sakura Y. Tawada A. Yoshida K. Lindahl U. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17804-17810Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar), desalted on a Sephadex G-15 column (1 × 190 cm),N-resulfated (as above), and size-fractionated on a Bio-Gel P-10 column (1 × 140 cm) in 0.5 mNH4HCO3 at 1 ml/h. Metabolically radiolabeled GMK HS was N-deacetylated in hydrazine hydrate containing 1% hydrazine sulfate at 96 °C for 5 h (27Guo Y. Conrad H.E. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 176: 96-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). The sample was evaporated, dissolved in 1 ml of water, desalted on a PD-10 column, and cleaved with nitrous acid at pH 4 (25Shively J.E. Conrad H.E. Biochemistry. 1976; 15: 3932-3942Crossref PubMed Scopus (667) Google Scholar), generating even-numbered oligosaccharides containing predominantly N-sulfated GlcN residues. Size fractionation was carried out on a column (1.6 × 60 cm) of Superdex 30 in 0.5 mNH4HCO3 at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. Oligosaccharides of different sizes were recovered, using labeled heparin oligosaccharides as standards, freeze-dried, and stored at −20 °C until further application. Serial 5-fold dilutions of modified heparin in 2 ml of EMEM were mixed with 200 μl of EMEM containing ∼200 plaque forming units (pfu) of HSV-1. Following incubation for 15 min at 37 °C, 1-ml portions of the virus/heparin mixtures were added in duplicate to confluent, 3-day-old monolayers of GMK cells cultivated in 6-well plates. After 1 h adsorption at 37 °C, the cells were washed twice with 2 ml of EMEM and overlaid with 1% methylcellulose solution in EMEM supplemented with 2% FCS and antibiotics. Subsequently the cells were incubated for 3 days at 37 °C and then stained with crystal violet solution to visualize the viral plaques. The effect of heparin oligosaccharides on HSV-1 infectivity was examined as described above, with the exception that oligosaccharides were tested at a concentration of 50 μg/ml. For direct binding studies, gC protein was incubated together with radiolabeled GAGs or GAG fragments in solution as described earlier (28Maccarana M. Lindahl U. Glycobiology. 1993; 3: 271-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Briefly, gC was incubated at the indicated concentration (see legends to figures) with radiolabeled saccharide in TBS at room temperature for 1 h. After incubation, the protein was trapped along with any bound GAG chains on a nitrocellulose filter (pore size 0.45 μm). The filter was twice washed rapidly with 5 ml of TBS. The protein-bound GAG chains were then released by adding 2 m NaCl and quantified by scintillation counting. In a series of experiments gC was incubated with radiolabeled, native, full-length heparin together with unlabeled, native, or desulfated heparin preparations as competitors. A pool of even-numbered oligosaccharides (∼1.5 × 106 dpm) containing N-sulfated GlcN residues, generated from metabolically 35S-labeled HS as described above, was incubated with HSV-1 (∼0.5–1 × 1010 pfu) in 1.1 ml of PBS for 3 h at 4 °C. The mixture was then centrifuged over 300-kDa filters (Microsep, Pal Filtron, Lund, Sweden) at 3400 ×g for 1 h at 4 °C. Subsequently the filter-retained HSV-1 particles along with any bound HS fragments were washed 3 times with 0.2 ml of PBS, and the bound fragments were dissociated from the virus by adding 2 m NaCl. For analysis a small aliquot of the adsorbed HS fragments was run on a Superdex 30 gel filtration column in 0.5 m NH4HCO3; 1-ml fractions were collected, and the radioactivity was quantified. The rest of the adsorbed HS fragments was desalted on a PD-10 column in H2O and freeze-dried. The unadsorbed HS fragments were preparatively run on Superdex 30. Fractions of oligosaccharides having the same size as the bound fragments were collected and freeze-dried. Both these HSV-1-bound and -unbound pools of similar size were subjected to structural analysis. One mg of purified gC was mixed with 1 mg of heparin and immobilized to 1 ml of CH-Sepharose CL4B gel according to the manufacturer's instructions. The material was transferred to a small column and extensively washed with 2m NaCl to remove the protecting heparin. The column was equilibrated with TBS. Radiolabeled GAGs were applied, and the column was washed with 10 ml of the equilibration buffer followed by elution with a linear gradient (40 ml) of 130 mm to 2 mNaCl in 50 mm Tris buffer, pH 7.4. One-ml fractions were collected and analyzed for radioactivity and salt concentration by liquid scintillation counting and conductometry, respectively. In preparative experiments, the bound and unbound fractions were separately pooled and freeze-dried prior to desalting on a PD-10 column. O-Desulfated heparin 12-mers were treated with nitrous acid at pH 1.5, resulting in deaminative cleavage at N-sulfated GlcN residues (25Shively J.E. Conrad H.E. Biochemistry. 1976; 15: 3932-3942Crossref PubMed Scopus (667) Google Scholar). The aldehyde groups created by the cleavage were reduced overnight with NaB3H4 followed by incubation with an excess of NaBH4 for 2–4 h (26Maccarana M. Sakura Y. Tawada A. Yoshida K. Lindahl U. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17804-17810Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). The partiallyN-desulfated/N-acetylated heparin 12-mer and metabolically labeled HS fragments were cleaved in the same way and reduced with an excess of NaBH4. The deamination product of the partially N-desulfated/N-acetylated heparin 12-mer was subjected to gel chromatography on a Bio-Gel P-10 column (1 × 140 cm) in 0.5 mNH4HCO3. The cleavage products of other oligosaccharides were desalted on a Sephadex G-15 column (1 × 190 cm) in 0.2 m NH4HCO3. The disaccharide fractions were pooled, lyophilized, and subjected to strong anion exchange chromatography (SAX-HPLC) on a Partisil-10 SAX column (29Bienkowski M.J. Conrad H.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 356-365Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Detection was carried out either by collection of 1-ml fractions and liquid scintillation counting or by direct on-line monitoring of the radioactivity by a flow detector (Radiomatic 500 TR, Packard, CT). The SAX-HPLC procedure was used to quantify allO-sulfated disaccharide deamination products. The total amounts of non-O-sulfated disaccharides (HexA-aManR) were determined by high voltage paper electrophoresis on Whatman No. 3MM paper in 80 mmpyridine/acetate buffer, pH 5.3. The paper was cut into 1-cm pieces that were analyzed for radioactivity, and the migration distance was compared with standard disaccharides in the same run. Employing three different systems we made an attempt to define the minimal length of heparin oligosaccharides capable of interacting with either the whole virus or its isolated HS-binding component, i.e. gC. In the incubation of HSV-1 with GMK cells at 37 °C, heparin inhibited the infection of the host cell, as demonstrated by a reduction of the number of viral plaques obtained. In this assay, heparin dodecamer was the shortest size-defined oligosaccharide that caused a ≥50% inhibition of virus infection (Fig.1 A). An otherwise identical experiment carried out at 4 °C implicated the decamer as the shortest binding fragment (not shown). Similar results were obtained when radiolabeled size-defined oligosaccharides were allowed to bind isolated gC protein in solution at room temperature; heparin dodecamer and larger heparin fragments bound efficiently to the protein, whereas all shorter species were ineffective (Fig. 1 B). Radiolabeled heparin and heparin oligosaccharides were also subjected to gC affinity chromatography which showed that full-length heparin chains were eluted at ∼0.3 m NaCl. Heparin deca- and dodecamer emerged slightly earlier, whereas the octamer did not bind (Fig.1 C). Taken together these results suggest that the shortest heparin oligosaccharide required for binding to the whole virus or to the isolated gC was composed of 10–12 monosaccharide units. As neither shorter heparin nor shorter HS fragments (see below) bound to immobilized gC, we concluded that affinity chromatography was a suitable tool to select for binding carbohydrate chains. Chemically desulfated heparins were used in the three different assay systems to assess the importance of different sulfate groups involved in the binding of heparin to the viral structures. Replacement of allN-sulfate groups by the charge neutral acetyl group reduced the inhibitory effect of heparin in the virus infectivity assay approximately 10-fold (Fig.2 A). Removal of most of the 2-O-sulfate groups or a considerable part of 6-O-sulfates (with concomitant loss of some 2-O-sulfates (Table I)) resulted in an approximately 100-fold reduction of efficiency. The same heparin preparations were also tested as competitors in protein binding assays. N-[3H]Acetyl-labeled heparin was incubated with gC in free solution in the presence of different amounts of unlabeled native or differentially desulfated heparins (Fig.2 B). Consistent with the results from the virus infectivity assay, removal of any of the sulfate groups drastically decreased the effect of heparin as a competitor. Native, fully sulfated heparin was the most efficient competitor. The preparations showed the same order of efficiency in the protein binding assay as they had in virus infectivity assays (Fig. 2 A), although the difference ofN- and O-desulfation was less pronounced than in the virus assay. More extensively modified heparin preparations were again totally inefficient. Affinity chromatography of 2-O-desulfated and preferentially 6-Odesulfated 3H-end-labeled heparin 20-mers (Table I) showed that the former derivative bound more efficiently to immobilized gC (Fig. 2 C). These results suggest that all types of sulfate groups contribute to the interaction. The roles of sulfate groups were studied further by subjecting variously modified heparin 12-mers to affinity chromatography on immobilized gC. Approximately 50% of a partiallyN-desulfated/N-acetylated heparin 12-mer bound to the gC affinity column (Fig.3 A), whereas most of the applied O-desulfated 12-mers, ∼95% for the 2-O-desulfated 12-mer (Fig. 4 A) and ∼99% for the 6-O-desulfated one (Fig. 4 B), failed to bind to the affinity matrix. However, the minor retarded fractions of theO-desulfated 12-mers required ∼0.3 m NaCl for elution, i.e. about the same salt concentration as needed to elute a 12-mer of native heparin. Rechromatography of the bound fractions showed that ∼70% of the applied samples bound (Fig.4 , A and B) to the column, and the unbound fraction did not bind (not shown). These observations thus confirm the occurrence of subfractions of the modified dodecamers which differed from the majority of the chains regarding the ability to bind gC.Figure 4gC affinity subfractionation ofO-desulfated heparin 12-mers. A,3H-Labeled selectively 2-O-desulfated 12-mer was subjected to gC affinity chromatography (○). An aliquot of the bound fractions (pool of fractions 13–18) was rechromatographed (•).B, 3H-labeled preferentially 6-O-desulfated 12-mer was similarly fractionated (○), and a part of the bound fractions (pool of fractions 12–18) was reapplied to the column (•).

These individual MAP kinase modules may provide a structural basis for different signaling cascades to relay extracellular stimuli to specific effectors. A challenge in understanding the mammalian MAP kinase cascade is how signaling specificity is achieved. Despite the MAP kinase modules, cross-talk still exists. The cross-talk may allow the cells to coordinate the activity of different signaling cascades to produce a specific physiological response. However, it also makes the signaling cascades prone to lack of specificity. Other mechanisms are needed to ensure the specificity of each MAP kinase cascade, including subcellular localization, specific associated proteins, high enzymatic specificity, and selective responsiveness to extracellular stimuli. The JNK cascade is activated by various stimuli such as growth factors, cytokines, tumor promoters, protein synthesis inhibitors, ultraviolet (UV) light irradiation, and oncogenes (1Karin M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16483-16486Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2258) Google Scholar). JNK in turn stimulates the activity of several transcription factors including c-Jun, ATF-2, Elk, and Sap-1 (6Hibi M. Lin A. Smeal T. Minden A. Karin M.

It is not completely understood how the specificity of the JNK cascade is maintained. One plausible mechanism is through the existence of multiple JNKKs that have high substrate specificity and respond to distinct upstream signals. To test this hypothesis, we have isolated a novel JNK-activating kinase, JNKK2, which is a close homologue of JNKK1. In contrast to JNKK1, which is selectively expressed in skeletal muscle and brain, JNKK2 is expressed in many tissues examined. Unlike JNKK1 which activates both JNK and p38, JNKK2 stimulated only JNK. Furthermore, JNKK2 did not respond to several extracellular stimuli that activate JNKK1. These data suggest that JNKK2 is a specific JNK activator and may contribute to the specificity of the JNK cascade. HeLa cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mm glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 mg/ml streptomycin. A human JNKK1 cDNA (20Lin A.

Thirty positive clones were obtained after screening 2 × 106 phage. These clones were grouped and sequenced on both strands by the dideoxy chain termination method using Sequenase Version II (U. S. Biochemical Corp.). Nucleotide sequence comparison of clones 4 and 23 with the GenBankTM data base reveals five sets of nucleotide sequences (GenBankTM accession numbers AA194047, AA019720,AA194193, AA258025, and AA252650) that are nearly identical. These clones were partially sequenced by the Washington University-Merck EST project. The clones AA194047 and AA019720 were requested and completely sequenced. The JNKK2 expression vector was constructed by inserting a polymerase chain reaction-generatedNcoI-BglII fragment encoding JNKK2 intoNcoI and BglII sites of pSRα3-hemagglutinin (HA) vector (20Lin A.

The effects of expression of MEKK1 and Rac/Cdc42Hs on JNKK2 activity were examined in transient transfection assays. Coexpression of the active forms of MEKK1, Rac1 and -2, and Cdc42Hs strongly activated JNKK2 (Fig.2 A). The active form of RhoA did not activate JNKK2 (Fig. 2 A) but was able to stimulate ERK activity (data not shown). MEKK1 also directly phosphorylated JNKK2 but not the JNKK2 (S272A/T276A) mutant, in which the putative activating phosphorylation residues Ser-272 and Thr-276 were replaced with alanines (Fig. 2 B). These results demonstrate that JNKK2 is a JNK-activating kinase which acts downstream of MEKK1 and Rac/Cdc42Hs in the JNK signaling pathway. We also examined the regulation of JNKK2 by UV and the protein synthesis inhibitor anisomycin, both of which are strong activators of JNKK1 (Fig. 2 C, top panel). UV and anisomycin only weakly stimulated JNKK2 activity (Fig. 2 C, middle panel), even though JNK activity was stimulated manyfold in the same transfection assays (Fig. 2 C, bottom panel). It is likely that JNKK2 may respond to upstream signals other than UV and anisomycin. MEKK1-activated HA-JNKK2 was isolated from transfected HeLa cells, and its substrate specificity was determined by protein kinase assays. JNKK2 efficiently phosphorylated GST-JNK1, but not GST-p38 or histidine-ERK2 (Fig.3 A). However, GST-p38 and histidine-ERK2 can be phosphorylated by their specific upstream kinases, MKK6 and MEK1(EE), respectively (Fig. 3 A). The phosphorylation of JNK by JNKK2 is specific, since JNKK2 did not phosphorylate mutants JNK1 (APY) or JNK1 (APF), in which the activating phosphorylation residues Thr-183 and Tyr-185 were replaced by alanine and phenylalanine (Fig. 3 B). Phosphorylation of JNK by JNKK2in vitro led to JNK activation, as measured in a coupled kinase assay (Fig. 3 C). The effect of JNKK2 on JNK in vivo was examined in transient transfection assays. In HeLa cells, cotransfection of JNKK2 stimulated M2 Flag-tagged JNK1 (M2-JNK1) activity (Fig. 3 D). The stimulation by JNKK2 was further potentiated by a suboptimal amount of cotransfected MEKK1 (Fig. 3 D). Under the same conditions, JNKK2 or JNKK2 plus MEKK1 did not stimulate M2-p38 activity (Fig.3 D). These data demonstrate that JNKK2 is a specific activator of JNK in vivo. To determine the effect of JNKK2 on c-Jun transcriptional activity, HeLa cells were cotransfected with the active form of MEKK1 and GAL4-c-Jun fusion protein (20Lin A. Minden A,. Martinetto H. Claret F.X. Lange-Carter C. Mercurio F. Johnson G.L. Karin M. Science. 1995; 268: 286-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (714) Google Scholar). MEKK1 stimulated GAL4-c-Jun activity 18-fold, as measured by a luciferase reporter gene driven by a GAL4 responsive promoter (Fig.4). Coexpression of wild-type JNKK2 potentiated the stimulatory effect of MEKK1 on GAL4-c-Jun, resulting in 28-fold activation (Fig. 4). Neither MEKK1 alone nor MEKK1 plus JNKK2 stimulated the activity of GAL4-c-Jun Ala-63/73, in which both Ser-63 and Ser-73 have been replaced with alanines (Fig. 4). These results demonstrate that JNKK2 participates in stimulation of c-Jun transcription activity. The specificity of the MAP kinase cascade is determined, in part, by enzymatic specificity of MAP kinase kinases in the MAP kinase module (2Cobb M.H. Goldsmith E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14843-14846Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1663) Google Scholar). JNKK1 was shown to be an efficient MAP kinase kinase of JNKin vitro (20Lin A. Minden A,.

Mercurio F. Johnson G.L. Karin M. Science. 1995; 268: 286-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (714) Google Scholar, 22Derijard B. Raingeaud J. Barrett T. Wu I.H. Han J. Ulevitch R.J. Davis R.J. Science. 1995; 267: 682-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (1415) Google Scholar). In contrast to JNKK1, JNKK2 is a highly selective kinase that phosphorylates and activates JNK but not p38 or ERK2 (Fig. 3 A). The high substrate specificity of JNKK2 should contribute to the specificity of the JNK cascade. The specificity of the JNK cascade may also be achieved by limiting the responsiveness of JNKKs to a certain subset of upstream stimuli. It has been shown that various extracellular stimuli and proto-oncogenes stimulate JNK activity, some of which do so through activating JNKK1. JNKK2 can be significantly activated by MEKK1, Rac, and Cdc42Hs, which are activators of JNKK1 (Fig. 2 A). However, JNKK2 was only weakly activated by UV and anisomycin (Fig. 2 C), both of which strongly activate JNKK1 (Fig. 2 C). Osmotic stress stimulates JNKK1, but only weakly stimulated JNKK2 activity (data not shown). The differential response of JNKK1 and JNKK2 to extracellular stimuli suggests that signaling leading to JNK activation may diverge upstream of JNK at the level of JNKKs. It is possible that JNKK2 may mediate the activation of JNK by extracellular stimuli that stimulate only JNK but not p38. Identification of extracellular stimuli that specifically activate JNKK2 should provide insights into the specificity of the JNK signaling pathway. We thank A. Minden and J.

In the present study, alkene monooxygenase has been resolved from the soluble fraction of cell-free extracts into four components, each of which has been purified to homogeneity, that are obligately required for alkene epoxidation activity. The four required components are 1) a monomeric 35.5-kDa protein containing 1 mol of FAD and a probable 2Fe-2S center; 2) a 13.3-kDa ferredoxin containing a Rieske-type 2Fe-2S cluster; 3) an 11-kDa monomeric protein that contains no detectable cofactors; and 4) a 212-kDa α2β2γ2 multimeric protein containing four atoms of nonheme iron. The 35.5-kDa protein has been characterized as an NADH reductase. The physiological electron acceptor for the reductase was the Rieske-type ferredoxin, which is proposed to be an intermediate electron carrier between the reductase and terminal catalytic component of the system. The 212-kDa protein was specifically inactivated in cell-free extracts by the mechanism-based inactivator propyne, suggesting that it is the catalytic component and contains the active site(s) for O2 activation and alkene epoxidation. The subunit structure and metal analysis of this component suggest that it contains two diiron centers, one for each αβγ protomeric unit. No specific enzymatic activities could be assigned for the 11-kDa protein, but this component was obligately required for steady-state alkene epoxidation. The alkene monooxygenase components were expressed during growth of Xanthobacter Py2 on aliphatic alkenes or epoxides and repressed during growth on other carbon sources. The electron transfer components of alkene monooxygenase were highly specific: other reductase activities present in Xanthobacter were incapable of transferring electrons to the Rieske-type ferredoxin or substituting for the reductase in the alkene monooxygenase complex. Likewise, other bacterial and plant ferredoxins were unable to substitute for the Rieske-type ferredoxin in mediating electron transfer to the oxygenase. The biochemical properties of alkene monooxygenase described in this study suggest that this enzyme combines elements of both the well-characterized aromatic dioxygenase (two-component electron transfer scheme) and methane monooxygenase (small regulatory protein and diiron oxygenase) multicomponent enzyme systems.

Xanthobacter strain Py2 is one of several bacteria capable of aerobic growth using aliphatic alkenes (e.g.ethylene, propylene, and butylene) as sources of carbon and energy (1van Ginkel C.G. de Bont J.A.M. Arch. Microbiol. 1986; 145: 403-407Crossref Scopus (69) Google Scholar,2Hartmans S. de Bont J.A.M. Harder W. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 1989; 63: 235-264Crossref Google Scholar). In these alkene-metabolizing bacteria, alkenes are oxidized to epoxides in reactions catalyzed by alkene monooxygenases as illustrated in Equation 1.H2C⋕CH—R+O2+NADH+H+→H2O/∖C—CH—R+NAD++H2O1 In Xanthobacter strain Py2, epoxides are further metabolized by a CO2-dependent carboxylation reaction, catalyzed by an epoxide carboxylase, that forms β-keto acids as products (3Small F.J. Ensign S.A. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 6170-6175Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 4Allen J.R. Ensign S.A. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 1469-1472Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A variety of bacterial monooxygenases catalyze the incorporation of an oxygen atom, derived from molecular oxygen, into aliphatic hydrocarbon substrates. These include methane monooxygenase, which hydroxylates methane to methanol (5Lipscomb J.D. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1994; 48: 371-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar), propane monooxygenase, which hydroxylates propane to isopropyl alcohol (6Vestal J.R. Perry J.J. J. Bacteriol. 1969; 99: 216-221Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and alkane hydroxylase, which catalyzes the terminal hydroxylation of longer chain length (C6 to C12) n-alkanes (7McKenna E.J. Coon M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1970; 245: 3882-3889Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, these enzymes have broad substrate ranges and can fortuitously catalyze the epoxidation of aliphatic alkenes in an identical manner to the reaction shown for alkene monooxygenase in Equation 1 (8Colby J. Stirling D. Dalton H. Biochem. J. 1977; 165: 395-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar, 9Woods N.R. Murrell J.C. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1989; 135: 2335-2344Google Scholar, 10Murrell J.C.

Witholt B. Enzyme Microb. Technol. 1983; 5: 352-357Crossref Scopus (82) Google Scholar). This common feature of reactivity toward alkenes suggests that the general class of hydrocarbon monooxygenases may share some similar biochemical and biophysical properties. Notably, however, alkene monooxygenases have a more restricted substrate specificity and are incapable of catalyzing the hydroxylation of saturated hydrocarbon substrates (1van Ginkel C.G. de Bont J.A.M. Arch. Microbiol. 1986; 145: 403-407Crossref Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 13Ensign S.A. Hyman M.R. Arp D.J. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1992; 58: 3038-3046Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 14Miura A. Dalton H. Biosci. Biotechnol. Biochem. 1995; 59: 853-859Crossref Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Recent in vitro studies of alkene monooxygenases from three bacteria, Nocardia corallina strain B-276 (14Miura A. Dalton H. Biosci. Biotechnol. Biochem. 1995; 59: 853-859Crossref Scopus (52) Google Scholar),Mycobacterium strain E3 (15Weber F.J. van Berkel W.J.H. Hartmans S. de Bont J.A.M. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 3275-3281Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16Hartmans S. Weber F.J. Somhorst D.P.M. de Bont J.A.M. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1991; 137: 2555-2560Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), andMycobacterium sp. strain M156 (17Woodland M.P. Matthews C.S. Leak D.J. Arch. Microbiol. 1995; 163: 231-234Crossref Scopus (9) Google Scholar) have revealed that these enzymes function as multiprotein complexes. This multicomponent nature is a feature shared by the aforementioned bacterial hydrocarbon monooxygenases that hydroxylate substrate molecules. The alkene monooxygenase complex from Nocardia corallina B-276 was recently purified and found to consist of three components as follows: a monomeric (40-kDa) NADH reductase containing FAD and a [2Fe-2S] cluster, a dimeric (53- and 35-kDa subunits) oxygenase containing two nonheme iron atoms, and a monomeric (14-kDa) coupling protein that contained no detectable cofactors (14Miura A. Dalton H. Biosci. Biotechnol. Biochem. 1995; 59: 853-859Crossref Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The alkene monooxygenase systems from Mycobacterium strain E3 andMycobacterium sp. strain M156 were each resolved into two fractions using anion exchange chromatography that could be recombined with restoration of activity (16Hartmans S. Weber F.J. Somhorst D.P.M. de Bont J.A.M. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1991; 137: 2555-2560Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 17Woodland M.P. Matthews C.S. Leak D.J. Arch. Microbiol. 1995; 163: 231-234Crossref Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Of these systems, only the NADH reductase component from Mycobacterium strain E3 has been purified. This reductase was a monomeric protein (56 kDa) containing FAD and a [2Fe-2S] cluster (15Weber F.J. van Berkel W.J.H. Hartmans S. de Bont J.A.M. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 3275-3281Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the present study, the purification and biochemical characterization of the alkene monooxygenase from Xanthobacter strain Py2 is reported. This particular alkene monooxygenase is of interest for several reasons. In whole cell suspensions, it has a broad substrate range for aliphatic alkenes, catalyzing the epoxidation of terminal and internal alkenes varying in chain length from ethylene to hexene (18van Ginkel C.G. Welten H.G.J. de Bont J.A.M. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1987; 53: 2903-2907Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, alkene monooxygenase will initiate the oxidation of a number of chlorinated alkenes, including trichloroethylene,cis- and trans-1,2-dichloroethylene, vinyl chloride, 1-chloropropylene, 1,3-dichloropropylene, and 2,3-dichloropropylene (13Ensign S.A. Hyman M.R. Arp D.J. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1992; 58: 3038-3046Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These reactive compounds represent a class of environmental pollutants that impose potential health hazards to humans and for this reason there is a fundamental need to understand biological mechanisms for their metabolism. Alkene monooxygenase ofXanthobacter strain Py2 is also an inducible enzyme that is repressed during growth with conventional carbon sources (e.g. glucose) and induced upon exposure of cells to a range of aliphatic and chlorinated alkenes and epoxides (19Ensign S.A. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1996; 62: 61-66Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Finally,Xanthobacter Py2 is a Gram-negative bacterium that is genetically tractable (20Zhou N.-Y. Chan Kwo Chion C.K. Leak D.J. Appl. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 1996; 44: 582-588Crossref Scopus (21) Google Scholar), a feature that should facilitate the characterization of the genes encoding alkene monooxygenase and related proteins. Xanthobacter strain Py2 was grown in 15-liter semicontinuous cultures in a Microferm fermentor (New Brunswick Scientific) with propylene as the carbon source as described previously (4Allen J.R. Ensign S.A. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 1469-1472Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were harvested at an A 600 between 2.5 and 4.0 by tangential-flow filtration with a Pellicon system (Millipore Corp.) and stored at −80 °C. Frozen cell paste (100–200 g) was thawed and resuspended in 2 volumes of buffer (100 mmMOPS 1The abbreviations used are: MOPS, 3-(N-morpholino)propane sulfonic acid; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; CHAPS, 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonate; MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid. (pH 7.2), 1 mm dithiothreitol, 5% (v/v) glycerol) containing 10 mg of deoxyribonuclease I. The cell suspension was passed three times through a French pressure cell at 110,000 kilopascal, and the lysate was clarified by centrifugation at 139,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C. Immediately after centrifugation the glycerol concentration of cell-free extracts was increased to 15% (v/v). The clarified cell-free extract was applied to a DEAE-Sepharose Fast Flow column (5.0 × 25 cm) equilibrated in 50 mm MOPS (pH 7.2), 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 15% (v/v) glycerol (buffer A) at a linear flow rate of 24 cm/h. After loading, the column was washed with 1300 ml of buffer A. The reductase component did not bind under these conditions and was collected in the flow-through and wash fractions. The column was further developed with a 3-liter linear gradient of 0 to 500 mm NaCl in buffer A, resulting in the elution of the remaining three alkene monooxygenase components. The oxygenase and small protein were localized in the fractions eluting between 200 and 250 mm NaCl, and the ferredoxin was localized in the fractions eluting between 370 and 410 mm NaCl. Ammonium sulfate was added to the fractions containing the oxygenase and small protein to a final concentration of 1.5 m. After incubating at 4 °C for 30 min the sample was centrifuged at 139,000 × g for 40 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was applied to a Pharmacia HiLoad 26/15 phenyl-Sepharose column equilibrated in buffer A containing 1.5m (NH4)2SO4 at a linear flow rate of 60 cm/h. The column was then washed with 200 ml of buffer A containing 1.5 m(NH4)2SO4. Under these conditions the small protein did not bind to the phenyl-Sepharose column and was recovered in the flow-through and wash fractions. The column was equilibrated with 200 ml of buffer A containing 300 mm(NH4)2SO4 and then developed further with a 300-ml reverse linear gradient of buffer A containing 300 to 0 mm (NH4)2SO4. After the completion of the gradient the column was washed with buffer A alone which eluted the oxygenase component. Fractions containing the oxygenase component were pooled and concentrated by ultrafiltration (YM30) to a volume of approximately 4 ml. The sample was then applied to a Pharmacia HiPrep 26/100 Sephacryl S-300 column equilibrated in buffer A containing 200 mm NaCl at a linear flow rate of 5.7 cm/h. Fractions containing the oxygenase component were pooled, concentrated by ultrafiltration, and frozen in liquid nitrogen. The flow-through and wash fractions that contained the small protein from phenyl-Sepharose were dialyzed against two 4-liter changes of 50 mm MOPS (pH 7.2) containing 1 mm dithiothreitol and 10% (v/v) glycerol (buffer B). To concentrate the small protein, the dialyzed sample was diluted 2-fold with buffer B and applied to a Pharmacia HiLoad 26/10 Q-Sepharose column equilibrated in buffer B at a linear flow rate of 45 cm/h. After washing the column with 100 ml of buffer B, the flow direction was reversed, and the small protein was eluted with buffer B containing 700 mm NaCl. Active fractions containing the small protein were pooled and further concentrated using ultrafiltration (YM3) to a volume of approximately 4 ml. The protein was then applied to a Pharmacia HiPrep 26/70 Sephacryl S-100 column equilibrated in buffer B plus 200 mm NaCl at a linear flow rate of 8 cm/h. Active fractions were pooled, concentrated by ultrafiltration, and frozen in liquid nitrogen. Fractions containing the ferredoxin from the DEAE-Sepharose column were diluted with 3 volumes of buffer B and applied to a Pharmacia HiLoad 26/10 Q-Sepharose column equilibrated in buffer B. The column was washed with 500 ml of buffer B containing 200 mm NaCl. The ferredoxin was eluted with a 500-ml linear gradient of 200–450 mm NaCl in buffer B at a linear flow rate of 17 cm/h. Fractions containing ferredoxin activity were pooled and concentrated by ultrafiltration (YM10) to a volume of approximately 4 ml. The protein was then applied to a Pharmacia HiPrep 26/60 Sephacryl S-100 column, equilibrated in 50 mm MOPS (pH 7.2) containing 5% (v/v) glycerol and 200 mm NaCl, at a linear flow rate of 8 cm/h. Fractions containing ferredoxin activity were collected, concentrated by ultrafiltration, and frozen in liquid nitrogen. The flow-through and wash fractions from DEAE-Sepharose that contained the reductase were brought to 20% (v/v) glycerol and 5 mm dithiothreitol. The sample was then applied to a column of Reactive Green 19 (2.5 × 10 cm), equilibrated in 50 mm MOPS (pH 7.2) containing 5 mm dithiothreitol and 20% (v/v) glycerol (buffer C) at a linear flow rate of 25 cm/h. The column was washed with 200 ml of buffer C. Reductase was eluted with a 400-ml linear gradient of 0 to 500 mm NaCl in buffer C. Fractions containing reductase activity were pooled and dialyzed against 4 liters of 50 mmMES buffer (pH 6.2) containing 3 mm dithiothreitol and 20% (v/v) glycerol (buffer D). The reductase was then applied to a column of SP-Sepharose Fast Flow (2.5 × 10 cm) equilibrated in buffer D, at a linear flow rate of 20 cm/h. After washing the column with 200 ml of buffer D, the column was developed with a 210-ml linear gradient of 0–150 mm NaCl in buffer D. Fractions containing reductase activity were pooled and concentrated by ultrafiltration (YM30) to a volume of 4 ml. The sample was then applied to a Pharmacia HiPrep 26/60 Sephacryl S-100 column equilibrated in 50 mm MOPS (pH 7.2) containing 3 mm dithiothreitol, 20% (v/v) glycerol, and 200 mm NaCl at a linear flow rate of 5.7 cm/h. Active fractions were pooled, concentrated by ultrafiltration, and frozen in liquid nitrogen. Incubations were performed in sealed serum vials (9-ml) containing buffer (50 mm MOPS (pH 7.2)), NADH (5 mm), propyne (3 ml), and cell-free extract (27 mg of protein) in a total volume of 1 ml. Inactivation of the alkene monooxygenase was optimized by incubating the vials with shaking for 45 min at 30 °C. The vials were then repeatedly evacuated and flushed with air on a vacuum manifold. Residual propyne and small molecules were removed by passing the extract over a Sephadex G-25 (1.5 × 5 cm) column equilibrated in MOPS buffer (50 mm (pH 7.2)). Alkene monooxygenase activity was monitored by following the time course of propylene depletion in sealed assay vials (9-ml) containing a source of enzyme (cell-free extract, column fractions, or purified components), NADH (5 mm), propylene (2200 nmol), and buffer (50 mmMOPS (pH 7.2)). All assays were performed in a shaking water bath at 30 °C in a total volume of 1 ml. Assays were initiated by the addition of NADH after a 2-min preincubation with all other components. Alkene monooxygenase activity was monitored by periodically removing samples from the head space of the reaction vials and quantifying the amount of propylene remaining using gas chromatography as described previously (21Small F.J. Tilley J.K. Ensign S.A. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1995; 61: 1507-1513Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). NADH:ferredoxin oxidoreductase activity was measured spectrophotometrically at 25 °C in a Shimadzu model UV160U spectrophotometer by monitoring the time-dependent decrease in absorbance at 460 nm resulting from the reduction of the iron-sulfur cluster of the purified ferredoxin (ε460 = 7,230m−1 cm−1). Assays were performed in 2-ml (1-cm path length) anaerobic quartz cuvettes that had been modified by fusing a serum bottle-style quartz top (7 × 13 mm at mouth), allowing the cuvettes to be sealed with a red rubber serum vial stopper. Stoppered cuvettes containing buffer (50 mm MOPS (pH 7.2)), NADH (5 mm), and oxidized ferredoxin (0.59 mg) in a total volume of 1 ml were made anoxic by repeated cycles of evacuation and flushing with argon on a vacuum manifold. At the desired times during the course of assays, a small amount of reductase, oxygenase, small protein, or cell-free extract was added to cuvettes with a microsyringe. All UV/visible spectra were obtained at 25 °C using a Shimadzu model UV160U spectrophotometer. EPR spectra were obtained using a Bruker model ESP 300 spectrometer equipped with an Air Products LTR3 liquid helium cryostat. A standard solution containing CuSO4 (1 mm) and EDTA (10 mm) was used for spin quantitation of the metal centers in protein samples. Circular dichroism spectra were recorded at 25 °C using an AVIV model 62DS spectropolarimeter with a 2-nm spectral bandwidth and a scan step every 1 nm. Background spectra were recorded for each cuvette with buffer alone and were subtracted from sample data. Dithionite-reduced samples of purified ferredoxin were prepared by the addition of sodium dithionite from a stock solution (100 mm, prepared anaerobically in 50 mm MOPS (pH 7.2)) to samples made oxygen-free by repeated cycles of evacuation and flushing with argon on a vacuum manifold. The final concentration of dithionite in samples was 1 mm. Electrochemical redox titrations were performed in a stirred cell in an argon-filled glove box as described by Ryle et al. (22Ryle M.J. Lanzilotta W.N. Seefeldt L.C. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 9424-9434Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The cell contained purified ferredoxin (0.33 mg/ml) in 100 mm MOPS buffer (pH 7.0) that contained 250 mm NaCl and the following redox mediators, each present at a concentration of 0.025 mm: 2-anthroquinonsulfonic acid, indigo disulfonate, methylene blue, toluidine blue, phenazine methosulfate, and 2,6-dichlorophenolindophenol. Samples poised at defined potentials were removed and frozen in calibrated EPR tubes in liquid nitrogen. EPR spectra were recorded at 12 K and 1.01 milliwatt microwave power. The fraction of reduced ferredoxin was determined by measuring the peak-to-peak height for the g = 1.92 region of the EPR spectrum. The reduction potential is reported with respect to the normal hydrogen electrode. Native molecular weights were estimated by gel filtration using a Pharmacia Superose 12 HR 10/30 column equilibrated in 50 mm MOPS (pH 7.2) containing 200 mm NaCl and 0.05% CHAPS. The column was calibrated using β-amylase, alcohol dehydrogenase, bovine serum albumin, ovalbumin, carbonic anhydrase, and cytochrome c. Polypeptide molecular weights were also determined using a matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometer (Micromars Inc.) operating in the linear mode at an acceleration voltage of 20 kV. Bovine serum albumin and myoglobin were used as the internal standards. Spectra were obtained for protein samples that had been dialyzed in deionized and distilled H2O. Apparent molecular weights of purified polypeptides using denaturing electrophoresis were determined by comparison with the R f values for molecular weight standard proteins. The standards were myosin (200 kDa), β-galactosidase (116.2 kDa), phosphorylase b (97.4 kDa), bovine serum albumin (66.2 kDa), ovalbumin (45 kDa), carbonic anhydrase (31 kDa), soybean trypsin inhibitor (21.5 kDa), lysozyme (14.4 kDa), and aprotinin (6.5 kDa). Quantitative amino acid analysis was performed by the Protein/Nucleic Acid Shared Facility at the Medical College of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, WI. Multi-elemental metal analysis was performed on an inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrophotometer at the Utah State University Soil and Plant Analysis Laboratory. Total iron content was determined colorimetrically by complexation with Ferene S (3–2-pyridyl-5,6-bis(2-(5-furylsulfonic acid))-1,2,4-triazine) as described by Haigler and Gibson (23Haigler B.E. Gibson D.T. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 457-464Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). SDS-PAGE (14% total gel; 2.7% cross-linker running gel) was performed in a Mini-Protean II apparatus (Bio-Rad) following the Laemmli procedure (24Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206631) Google Scholar). Electrophoresed proteins were visualized by Coomassie Blue staining. The flavin cofactor was extracted from purified reductase by the addition of 0.5% (v/v) trichloroacetic acid followed by boiling (5 min). The flavin was identified by high pressure liquid chromatography as described previously (25Latimer M.T. Painter M.H. Ferry J.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24023-24028Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). A molar absorptivity of ε456 = 11.3 mm−1 was used for quantitation of FAD content. Protein concentrations were determined using either a modified biuret assay with bovine serum albumin as the standard (26Chromy V. Fischer J. Kulhanek V. Clin. Chem. 1974; 20: 1362-1363Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) or extinction coefficients that were calculated based on the results obtained from quantitative amino acid analysis of protein samples. CHAPS detergent, NADH, and Ferene S were purchased from Sigma. Propylene (99% minimum) was purchased from Matheson gas products. Propyne (>84%) was obtained from Columbia Organic Chemicals Co. Consistent with the results of a previous study (1van Ginkel C.G. de Bont J.A.M. Arch. Microbiol. 1986; 145: 403-407Crossref Scopus (69) Google Scholar), cell-free extracts of Xanthobacter strain Py2 prepared from propylene-grown cells oxidized propylene to propylene oxide in an O2- and NADH-dependent fashion. Alkene monooxygenase activity was quantitatively recovered in the soluble fraction after sedimentation of membranes by high speed centrifugation, indicating that the enzyme is a soluble protein. The addition of membranes to the soluble fraction did not increase or decrease alkene monooxygenase activity. The soluble fractions of cell-free extracts prepared from different batches of cells had highly variable specific activities, ranging from 5 to 55 nmol of propylene oxidized/min/mg. In contrast, the specific activities of alkene monooxygenase in the whole cell suspensions used to prepare cell-free extracts was consistently in the range of 90 to 110 nmol/min/mg. Cell-free extracts from different batches of cells were prepared identically, so it is presently unclear why the in vitro activities are so variable. The addition of cysteine and ferrous iron, which stimulate activity of some other bacterial oxygenase systems (27Fox B.G. Froland W.A. Dege J.E. Lipscomb J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 10023-10033Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 28Newman L.M. Wackett L.P. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 14066-14076Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar), had no effect on activity when added to the lysis buffer or to the buffer used to assay alkene monooxygenase. Likewise, lysis under anaerobic conditions, the addition of other divalent metal ions (Zn2+, Cu2+, and Mg2+), and the addition of protease inhibitors (phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, leupeptin, or aprotinin) had no effect on in vitro activity. The addition of glycerol had a stabilizing effect on alkene monooxygenase activity and was included for the purification of each component. Most preparations of cell-free extracts had activities of 15–25 nmol/min/mg; for consistency, the purification procedures described below made use of cell-free extracts with specific activities in this range. Alkene monooxygenase was resolved into four components obligately required for reconstitution of activity. These four components were individually purified on the basis of their ability to complement the other three components in reconstituting alkene monooxygenase activity. Activity assays were performed under conditions where three components were present at saturating concentrations so that specific rates could be reported relative to the concentration of the fourth component, which was limiting in the assay. The biochemical properties of each component are described separately below. Active fractions eluting off the initial DEAE-Sepharose column at salt concentrations between 370 and 410 mm NaCl were brown-red in color, suggesting that this component may be a ferredoxin and play a role in electron transfer. A summary of the three-step protocol used for the purification of the ferredoxin is presented in Table I. As shown in Fig. 1, the purified protein ran on SDS-PAGE as two closely migrating bands with apparent molecular masses of 19.5 and 18.7 kDa. The Coomassie Blue staining intensities of the two bands are not equal; the higher molecular weight band is present in an approximately 15-fold excess based on staining intensity. The protein was chromatographed over several additional columns (i.e. S-200 and Superose 12 gel filtration, Reactive Green affinity) with no further increase in specific activity nor change in the relative intensities of the two bands. When subjected to electrophoresis on a nondenaturing gel, the ferredoxin migrated as a single band. This band could be cut from the nondenaturing gel and then electrophoresed under denaturing conditions, revealing the same two bands (data not shown). The inclusion of protease inhibitors (phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, leupeptin, EDTA, and EGTA) in the lysis and chromatography buffers used for the purification of the ferredoxin did not change the doublet pattern seen for the purified protein on denaturing gels (data not shown).Table IPurification of the four alkene monooxygenase componentsStepVolumeTota"

We examine here the role of human TR-β2, a TR isoform with central nervous system-restricted expression, in the regulation of target genes whose expression are decreased by triiodothyronine (T3). Using transient transfection studies, we found that TR-β2 achieved significantly greater ligand-independent activation on the thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) and common glycoprotein α-subunit genes than either TR-β1 or TR-α1. A chimeric TR-β isoform containing the TR-β2 amino terminus linked to the TR-α1 DNA- and ligand-binding domains functioned like the TR-β2 isoform on these promoters, confirming that the amino terminus of TR-β2 was both necessary and sufficient to mediate this effect. By constructing deletion mutants of the TR-β2 amino terminus, we demonstrate that amino acids 89–116 mediate this function. This domain, important in ligand-independent activation on negative TREs, is discrete from a previously described activation domain in the amino-terminal portion of TR-β2. We conclude that the central nervous system-restricted TR-β2 isoform has a unique effect on negative regulation by T3 that can be mapped to amino acids 89–116 of the amino terminus of the human TR-β2.

By alternative RNA splicing, the c-erbA-α locus gives rise to TR-α1 and c-erbA-α2 (6Koenig R.J. Lazar M.A. Hodin R.A. Brent G.A. Larsen P.R. Chin W.W. Moore D.D. Nature. 1989; 337: 659-661Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar); the latter does not bind T3 and may inhibit the function of other TRs (7Lazar M.A. Hodin R.A. Darling D.S. Chin W.W. Mol.

Miyamoto T. Takeda T. Ozata M. DeGroot L.J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 86-95PubMed Google Scholar). Using alternative 5′ exons and presumably separate promoters, TR-β1 and TR-β2 are derived from the c-erbA-β locus (10Hodin R.A. Lazar M.A. Wintman B.I. Darling D.S. Koenig R.J. Larsen P.R. Moore D.D.

Thus, TR-β isoforms differ only in their amino-terminal domains (see Fig.1 A). Although the α1 and β1 TR isoforms are expressed ubiquitously (12Sakurai A. Nakai A. DeGroot L.J. Mol.

On positively regulated genes, like the growth hormone and myosin heavy chain genes, TR causes ligand-independent silencing and T3 activates transcription (17Glass C.K. Franco R. Weinberger C.

Transcriptional regulation by TRs occurs via binding to TREs; these are composed of the half-site consensus sequences AGGTCA, which binds TR (33Brent G.A. Harney J.W. Chen Y. Warne R.L. Moore D.D. Larsen P.R. Mol. Endocrinol. 1989; 3: 1996-2004Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Positive response elements (pTREs) consist of either palindromic, direct-repeat, or inverted-repeat configurations (34Norman M.F. Lavin T.N. Baxter J.D. West B.L. J. Biol.

Flynn T.R. Boers M.E. Cohen O. Wondisford F.E. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 540-550Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For these response elements, the direction and spacing of the half-sites is important for transcriptional modulation (32Cohen O. Flynn T.R. Wondisford F.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13899-13905Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar).Considering the restricted localization of its expression, TR-β2 may play a unique role in negative regulation by thyroid hormone of centrally located genes, but its specific role in negative regulation has not been extensively studied. We focused this study on the amino termini of TR-β1 and TR-β2 since this is the only difference between these isoforms. Our results show that TR-β2 is the only TR isoform capable of significant ligand-independent activation of the TRH and TSH-α promoters, resulting in increased repression in the presence of T3. The area responsible for this unique pathway of negative regulation by TR-β2 is located in the area between the 89th and the 116th amino acids of its amino terminus.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESThe negative response element reporter constructs included the 5′-flanking sequences for the TRH (20Hollenberg A.N. Monden T. Flynn T.R. Boers M.E. Cohen O. Wondisford F.E. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 540-550Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and the common glycoprotein α-subunit gene (23Chatterjee V.K.K. Lee J.

The construct TRETK contains two copies of idealized pTREs arranged as a palindrome upstream of a minimal thymidine kinase promoter fused to the luciferase gene (37Chatterjee V.K. Nagaya T. Madison L.D. Datta S. Rentoumis A. Jameson J.L. J. Clin. Invest. 1991; 87: 1977-1984Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). A thymidine kinase control plasmid contains 199 base pairs of the 5′-flanking region fused to the luciferase gene (TK199) (27Bodenner D.L. Mroczynski M.A. Weintraub B.D. Radovick S. Wondisford F.E.

All promoter constructs fused to the luciferase reporter gene contained two transcriptional stop sequences upstream of the promoter to prevent read-through transcription (pSVO-ALΔ5′ vector; Ref. 38DeWet J.R.

Harris B.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 7119-7136Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The human TR-β2 amino terminus was obtained by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification of genomic DNA and ligated to the SacI site of TR-β common sequences forming the TR-β2 cDNA. The DNA sequence and location of the methionine start codon for translation were identical to a previous report. 2K. Damm, National Center for Biotechnology Information, 1993, GenBankTM Data Bank accession number G437814.Chimeric TR-β2αα was constructed by introducing aSacI site into TR-α1 at amino acid 52 to allow for exchange with the TR-β2 amino terminus. The amino-terminal deletion TR-Δββ was constructed using PCR to introduce a Kozak initiation sequence at the beginning of the DNA binding domain (41Hollenberg A.N. Monden T. Wondisford F.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14274-14280Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The TR-β2 amino-terminal deletion constructs were made using PCR to introduce anXbaI site at either amino acid 87 or 116 (to ligate with TR-β common region). An identical Kozak initiation sequence preceded by an EcoRI site was present at the 5′ end of each amino-terminal deletion construct.The reporter used for heterologous expression system was UAS-TK fused upstream of the luciferase gene (42Moghal N. Neel B.G. Mol Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3945-3959Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The amino-terminal cDNAs from the TR-β2 deletion constructs were cloned in-frame with the GAL4-DNA as an EcoRI-SacI insert in the pBXGI vector (43Emami K.H. Carey M. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 5005-5012Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The integrity of all constructs was confirmed by restriction endonuclease digestion and dideoxy sequencing.The CV-1 cell line was used for all experiments. Transient transfections were performed in 6-well plates on subconfluent cells using the calcium-phosphate technique without glycerol shock. Except where otherwise noted, 1.6 μg of reporter construct and 80 ng of receptor expression vector (or equivalent of vector alone) were introduced into each well. 16 h after transfection, culture medium was replaced with culture medium containing fetal bovine serum treated with anion exchange and activated charcoal; 10 nmT3 was added when indicated. 36–40 h after transfection, cells were harvested and assayed for luciferase activity. Data were from at least three independent experiments, performed in triplicate, and are displayed as mean ± S.E.A probe representing the −78 to −36 sequence of the human TRH promoter (20Hollenberg A.N. Monden T. Flynn T.R. Boers M.E. Cohen O. Wondisford F.E. Mol.

Proteins were made by in vitrotranslation in rabbit reticulocyte lysate (TNT kit, Promega) using TR isoforms or RXRα cDNAs in pSG5 and T7 polymerase. Three μl of each protein was used in each reaction with radiolabeled probe (100,000 cpm). Gel-mobility shifts were performed as described previously (20Hollenberg A.N. Monden T. Flynn T.R. Boers M.E. Cohen O. Wondisford F.E. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 540-550Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).Nuclear extracts were made from CV-1 cells transfected as described above with 10 μg of expression plasmid/100-mm plate. Cells were harvested, and nuclei were purified as described by Surks et al. (44Surks M.I. Koerner D. Dillman W.H. Oppenheimer J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1973; 248: 7066-7072Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). After the final centrifugation, the nuclear pellet was resuspended in 30 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 0.4 m NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 2 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, dithiothreitol, and protease inhibitors. 60 μg (Bradford assay) of nuclear extracts and 1 μl of in vitro translated TR-β2 (as a control) were used for Western blotting using standard techniques and a C4 antibody (Dr. Cheng, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD), which is directed against the carboxyl terminus of TR-β. Detection was accomplished using the BM Chemiluminescence Western blotting kit (Boehringer Mannheim, Germany).RESULTSShown in Fig. 1 A is a schematic representation of the different TR constructs used in this study. In Fig. 1 B, amino acid sequences of the human, rat, mouse, and chick amino terminus of TR-β2 are compared. To map the specific effect of TR-β2, six deletion constructs were made. These are shown in Fig. 1 C, and the deleted (Δ) region is underlined in Fig. 1 B. All receptor constructs were inserted into a viral expression vector (pSG5) for use in transient transfection studies.We first wanted to determine if TR-β2 was different from other TR isoforms with respect to negative regulation of the TRH and common α-subunit genes. In the absence of ligand (T3), TR activates transcription of negatively regulated genes, termed ligand-independent activation. It is clear that TR-β2 has an increased capacity to activate in the absence of ligand compared with the other TR isoforms (4.0-fold versus 1.1–1.4-fold) on the TRH promoter (Fig. 2 A) and α-subunit promoter (3.6-fold versus 1.2–1.5-fold, Fig.2 B). Similar results were obtained with the rat TR-β2 (data not shown), suggesting that this effect is preserved in different species and may have physiological relevance.Figure 2A, effect of TR isoforms and TR-β2αα chimera on ligand-independent activation of the TRH promoter construct in CV-1 cells. -Fold activation by TR isoforms is compared with empty pKCR2 vector (−).

Moreover, we find no significant ligand-dependent repression of this construct in CV-1 cells under the conditions used in this study (data not shown). Thus in contrast to a previous report, our results cannot be explained by a nonspecific effect of TR on the luciferase reporter gene (45Maia A.L. Harney J.W. Larsen P.R. Thyroid. 1996; 6: 325-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar).To determine if the amino-terminal domain of TR-β2 was responsible for its enhanced ligand-independent activation in comparison with the other TR isoforms, we transferred the TR-β2 amino terminus to the TR-α DNA- and ligand-binding domains forming the chimeric receptor, TR-β2αα. As expected, the TR-β2αα construct had properties similar to TR-β2, and not to TR-α, both on TRH- and α-subunit reporter constructs (Fig. 2, A and B, respectively). This confirms that the amino terminus of TR-β2 mediates the unique ligand-independent activation capacity of TR-β2.The effect of TRs on negatively regulated genes has two components: 1) activation of transcription in the absence of ligand (ligand-independent activation); and 2) repression of transcription when T3 is present (ligand-dependent repression). Shown in Fig. 2 D is ligand-dependent repression of the different TR isoforms on the TRH reporter construct. Again, TR-β2 yielded greater ligand-dependent repression versus the other isoforms (2.3-fold versus 1.15–1.3-fold). The increased -fold ligand-dependent repression, however, seems to be due to increased ligand-independent activation of TR-β2 since the actual levels of repressed transcription are similar for all reporter constructs (data not shown, and Fig.3).Figure 3Mapping of the ligand-independent activation (−T3) and ligand-dependent repression (+T3) of the TR-β2 amino terminus on the TRH promoter. The TR expression construct used is noted at the bottom of the graph compared with empty pKCR2 vector (−). 1–120 is equivalent to wt TR-β2. At the bottom of the figure is a Western blot analysis of nuclear extract obtained from CV-1 cells transfected with the corresponding construct from the upper part of the figure. Anarrow at 60 kDa is shown, corresponding to expression of the wt TR-β2 in this cell line. The apparent molecular size of TR-β2 deletion constructs was smaller because of deletion of region of the amino terminus.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To isolate the regions of the TR-β2 amino terminus important for ligand-independent activation, we constructed a number of deletions that are shown in Fig. 1 C. Constructs can be viewed as pairs, with progressive deletions of the 5′ end of the amino terminus (21, 51, 89 amino acids) with or without a deletion of the area between amino acids 87–116 (the Δ constructs). Fig. 3 illustrates both ligand-independent activation (−T3) and ligand-dependent repression (+T3) for these deletion constructs on the TRH reporter construct. Clearly, whenever amino acids 87–116 are deleted, TR-β2 loses its ligand-independent activation and is not significantly different from data obtained from transfection of either TR-β1, TR-Δββ (a construct without any amino terminus), or empty vector (pSG5, −) alone. However, deletions of the first 20, 50, or 88 amino acids does not reduce ligand-independent activation of TR-β2. This indicates that amino acids 89–116 of TR-β2 are responsible for its unique properties in negative regulation of the TRH gene by T3. Furthermore, as shown in Fig. 1 B, this area is completely conserved in the chicken and less so in the mouse and rat, supporting a potential physiological significance.At the bottom of Fig. 3 is a Western blot analysis of wt and mutant TR-β2 expression in nuclear extracts obtained from transfected CV-1 cells. A band of approximately 60 kDA (arrow) was detected after a wt TR-β2 transfection but not after transfection of pSG5 alone (−), indicating detection of TR-β2 protein in transfected cells. Progressively smaller bands of similar intensity were detected in CV-1 cells transfected with TR-β2 deletion constructs. Thus, these functional data on the TRH promoter cannot be explained by differences in expression levels of the TR-β2 deletion constructs.Similar results were obtained on the α-subunit reporter construct (Fig. 4). Interestingly, deletion of either the first 50 or 88 amino acids actually enhanced ligand-independent activation on the α-subunit gene, suggesting that the first 50 amino acids of TR-β2 may mask ligand-independent activation of the 89–116 region on certain promoters.Figure 4Mapping of the ligand-independent activation of the TR-β2 amino terminus on the α-subunit promoter. A similar experiment to that described in Fig. 3 is shown here with the common α reporter. The construct used is noted in the bottom of the figure compared with empty pKCR2 vector (−).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)A transactivation domain specific to the TR-β2 isoform (chicken) was recently ascribed, using a GAL4 heterologous expression system, to a region between the 29th and 76th amino acids of the TR-β2 amino terminus (46Sjöberg M. Vennström B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4718-4726Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We used this model system to prove that the region responsible for a unique effect in negative T3 regulation was discrete from this previously described domain. Results from these mapping experiments are shown in Fig. 5. This figure demonstrates that the human TR-β2, like the chicken TR-β2, has a transactivation domain (15.3-fold versus0.8-fold activation for TR-β1) mapping primarily to a region between amino acids 21 and 50 in this study and overlapping the previously described chicken TR-β2 transactivation domain. This graph also denotes that the deletion of the area from amino acids 89 to 116 does not significantly affect activation in this heterologous system (no difference between TR-β2 wt and 1–120Δ or 21–120 and 21–120Δ). Thus, the domain important for ligand-independent activation on negative TREs is different from the previously described transactivation domain.Figure 5Transcriptional activation by TR-amino termini in a heterologous (GAL4) expression system. The amino terminus of wt TR-β1, wt TR-β2, or TR-β2 amino-terminal deletions were fused downstream and in-frame with the GAL4 DNA-binding domain in pBXGI. Two copies of the VP-16 transactivation domain were also inserted into the same vector. Empty GAL4 vector is indicated by (−). These GAL4 DNA-binding domain chimeric constructs were tested on the UASTK luciferase activity and mean -fold activation ± S.E. is displayed.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)We next tested the TR-β2 deletion constructs on a reporter construct containing two copies of an idealized palindromic pTRE (TRETK). Fig.6 demonstrates that transfection of TR-β1 yields greater -fold T3 activation than wt TR-β2. Note when you examine TR-β2 constructs as pairs (1–120 with 1–120Δ, 21–120 with 21–120Δ, etc.), the Δ construct always displays greater T3 activation than its full-length counterpart. In particular, the 1–120Δ construct relative to the full-length 1–120 TR-β2, achieves activity similar to wt TR-β1. This suggests that the nTRE domain we describe here might antagonize the positive T3 regulatory properties of TR-β2. It also strengthens our conclusions on the nTRE reporters since the Δ constructs that yielded very little activity on negatively regulated genes now show increased T3 activation on TRETK compared with their pair constructs with an intact 89–116 domain. Thus, there appears to be an opposite effect of the 89–116 domain in positiveversus negative regulation by T3.Figure 6Effect of TR-β2 deletion constructs on a positive T3 response element. -Fold T3activation of the TR expression constructs on the TRETK promoter is shown. The TR expression construct used is noted at the bottom of the graph compared with empty pKCR2 vector (−). 1–120 is equivalent to wt TR-β2.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)It can also be noted that the constructs with no or little activation in the heterologous expression system (51–120, 51–120Δ, 89–120, Fig. 5) show significantly lower ligand-dependent activation of this positively regulated TRE than the other constructs containing the amino acids 21–50, such as wt TR-β2, 1–120Δ, 21–120, and 21–120 Δ. This implies that the transactivation domain located between amino acids 21 and 50 has its importance primarily for positive regulation by T3.Using a gel-shift assay, we evaluated DNA-binding of the different deletion constructs. In data not shown, TR-β2 deletion constructs were in vitro translated to a similar extent as demonstrated in [35S]methionine labeling of translation products. TR-β2 deletion constructs show similar heterodimeric binding to the site 4 DNA probe, which is an important nTRE present in the TRH promoter (Fig. 7). This confirms the integrity and similar translation effi"
https://openalex.org/W2086140525,"Cdc42 plays an important role in intracellular signaling pathways that influence cell morphology and motility and stimulate DNA synthesis. In attempts to determine whether nonreceptor tyrosine kinases play a fundamental role in Cdc42 signaling, we have cloned and biochemically characterized a new Cdc42-associated tyrosine kinase (ACK) from bovine brain. This tyrosine kinase, named ACK-2, has a calculated molecular mass of 83 kDa and shares a number of primary structural domains with the 120-kDa ACK (ACK-1). The main differences between the primary structures of ACK-2 and ACK-1 occur in the amino- and carboxyl-terminal regions. Like ACK-1, ACK-2 binds exclusively to activated (GTP-bound) Cdc42 and does not bind to its closest homologs,e.g. activated Rac. ACK-2 could not be activated by addition of glutathione S-transferase (GST)-Cdc42(Q61L), a GTPase-defective mutant, or by GTPγS-loaded GST-Cdc42 in in vitro kinase assays. However, ACK-2 was activated when cotransfected with wild type Cdc42 or Cdc42(Q61L) and stably associated with Cdc42(Q61L) in vivo, indicating that ACK-2 interacts with active Cdc42 in cells. Furthermore, the tyrosine kinase activity of ACK-2 was stimulated both by epidermal growth factor and bradykinin, suggesting that ACK-2 may play a role in the signaling actions of both receptor tyrosine kinases or heterotrimeric G-protein-coupled receptors."

Strikingly, much of the same repair machinery is necessary for cell survival following ionizing radiation (IR) damage, known to include DSB repair (1Weaver D.T. Trends Genet. Sci. 1995; 11: 388-392Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar, 2Jackson S.P. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1996; 6: 19-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). In both the IR response and V(D)J recombination, genetic and molecular analysis has revealed that the components of the DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK) complex are essential in these repair responses. DNA-PK consists of a complex of three proteins (reviewed in Ref. 3Jin S. Inoue S. Weaver D.T. Cancer Surv. 1997; 29: 221-261PubMed Google Scholar). DNA-PKcs is the 470-kDa catalytic subunit of DNA-PK containing a protein kinase homology domain at its C terminus. DNA-PKcs is structurally related to several other proteins that are implicated in radiation-induced checkpoint responses (4Hartley K.O. Gell D. Smith G.C.M. Zhang H. Dvecha N. Connelly M.A. Admon A.

Ku binds to DNA in DSB repair reactions and in the absence of DNA-PKcs (10Boubnov N.V. Weaver D.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5700-5706Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 11Lees-Miller S.P.

Potentially, the pools of Ku and DNA-PKcs are not always associated in eukaryotic cells, allowing activation and alternative regulation of the kinase by effector protein binding. Although DNA-PK activity may elicit a DSB repair response to IR, DNA-PK substrates may have other functions. Recently, the nuclear tyrosine kinase, c-Abl, was shown to be activated by IR and to act upstream of c-Jun N-terminal kinase/stress-activated protein kinase (JNK/SAPK) in signaling mechanisms that are initiated by DNA damage (12Kharbanda S. Ren R. Pandey P. Shafman T.D. Feller S.M. Weichselbaum R.R. Kufe D.W. Nature. 1995; 376: 785-788Crossref PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar). c-Abl directly associates and is phosphorylated by DNA-PK following IR (13Kharbanda S. Pandey P. Jin S. Inoue S. Bharti A. Yuan Z.-M. Weichselbaum R. Weaver D. Kufe D. Nature. 1997; 386: 732-735Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). Due to its growth-regulatory functions, c-Abl may regulate cell decisions of progression through the cell cycle or apoptosis, and c-Abl/DNA-PK interactions are responsive to DNA damage (13Kharbanda S. Pandey P. Jin S. Inoue S. Bharti A. Yuan Z.-M. Weichselbaum R. Weaver D. Kufe D. Nature. 1997; 386: 732-735Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). To better understand the significance of Ku and c-Abl associations with DNA-PK, we have examined the location of binding of these proteins. We find that Ku and c-Abl bind to the C terminus of DNA-PKcs near the kinase domain. Furthermore, c-Abl phosphorylates a DNA-PKcs fragment to which Ku binds and results in disassociation of DNA-PKcs from Ku. A murine (22D6 pre-B cell) λ phage cDNA library was screened by reduced stringency hybridization procedures with two fragments of the human DNA-PKcs cDNA isolated by PCR, the 3′-untranslated region (14Blunt T.

Phage cDNA inserts were excised by NotI digestion and subcloned into pSKII+ (Stratagene). Specific DNA-PKcs polypeptides were formed using a coupled in vitro transcription/translation methodology (Promega) with templates generated from the above cDNAs by PCR. 5′ Primers contained a T7 RNA polymerase initiation sequence, ribosome binding site, and initiator methionine (GGATCCTAATACGACTCACTATAGGGAGACCACCATG) + 18–20 nucleotides specific to the 5′ end of each DNA-PKcs fragment. 3′ Primers were 21-mers. PCR products had the following amino acid coordinates and protein fragment sizes: DNA-PKcs-2 (5–527, 59.4 kDa), DNA-PKcs-1 (515–830, 36 kDa), DNA-PKcs-3 (770–1084, 35.7 kDa), DNA-PKcs-4 (1079–1533, 50.6 kDa), DNA-PKcs-14 (1520–1792, 30.9 kDa), DNA-PKcs-11 (1668–1976, 36 kDa), DNA-PKcs-5 (2005–2535, 61.1 kDa), DNA-PKcs-6 (2333–2774, 51 kDa), DNA-PKcs-7 (2768–3258 56.8 kDa), DNA-PKcs-10 (3002–3450, 48.7 kDa), DNA-PKcs-13 (3002–3550, 59.5 kDa), DNA-PKcs-8 (3414–3850, 44.6 kDa), DNA-PKcs-15 (3414–4123, 80.8 kDa), and DNA-PKcs-9 (3757–4124, 41 kDa). 1–2 μg of PCR products purified by 0.7% agarose gel electrophoresis were used in the T7 in vitro transcription/translation. Full-length c-Abl tyrosine kinase was engineered as an N-terminal fusion protein with glutathione S-transferase (GST) from SF9 cells infected with the GST-c-Abl recombinant baculovirus (15Mayer B.J.

SF9 lysates were prepared in 20 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, and stored at −80 °C. GST-c-Abl was isolated by binding to glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) (0.5 ml of lysate/0.25 ml of beads) at 4 °C for 30 min. Beads were then washed four times in 10 ml of MTPBS (20 mm NaPO4, pH 7.4, 150 mmNaCl) and then eluted with freshly prepared 10 mmglutathione in 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 9.5, 100 mmNaCl (final pH = 8.0) four times at 4 °C for 5 min each. Pooled fractions were passed through a 0.45-micron filter and assessed by a Bradford concentration assay and SDS-PAGE. GST fusions to DNA-PKcs fragments 7, 8, and 9 were prepared by PCR incorporating a 5′ BamHI site and 3′ XhoI site for subcloning into BamHI/XhoI-cleaved pGEX4T2, creating in-frame fusion proteins. GST protein (pGEX4T2) and GST-7, -8, and -9 proteins were produced by transformation of Escherichia coli BL21. Cultures of 1 liter in LB + 100 μg/ml ampicillin were grown to A 595 of 0.6, adjusted to 1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside, and grown for an additional 5 h at 25 °C. Cells were harvested, and 40-ml lysates were prepared in PBS + 1 mg/ml lysozyme, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, 10 mm EDTA for 15 min on ice, followed by freezing and thawing twice in liquid N2. Lysates were adjusted to 1% Triton X-100, 100 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, incubated on ice for 10 min, and sonicated with a Branson Sonifier 450. Sonicated lysates were spun in a Beckman J6 centrifuge with a JA-20 rotor at 15,000 rpm for 15 min. GST and GST fusion proteins were isolated by binding to 1–2 ml of GST beads (pre-equilibrated in PBS, 1% Triton X-100) by rocking for 30 min at 4 °C. Beads were then washed five times in PBS + 1% Triton X-100 prior to elution. Approximately 1 × 107 human 293 cells were lysed in 1.0 ml of Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, 1 μg/ml aprotinin) on ice for 15 min. The NaCl concentration was then adjusted to 500 mm with 78 μl of 5m NaCl so that Ku and DNA-PKcs disassociate (17Suwa A. Hirakata M. Takeda Y. Jesch S.A. Mimori T. Hardin J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Lysates were also precleared by adjusting to 6% polyethylene glycol 8000 for 10 min on ice and microcentrifugation for 15 min at 4 °C. Aliquots of 293 lysates (0.5–1.0 mg) were mixed with equal amounts of each [35S]DNA-PKcs in vitro translation product (10–20 μl), diluted to reduce the NaCl concentration to 150–170 mm (final volume = 350–450 μl), and incubated on ice for 1–3 h.

Prewashed protein A-Sepharose (10 μl) was added and incubated for an additional 30 min while rocking at 4 °C. Protein A-bound immunoprecipitates were washed four times with 1 ml of 10 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 0.1% Triton X-100, and resuspended in 20 μl of 2 × SB (100 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.0, 4% SDS, 720 mm2-mercaptoethanol, 5 mg/ml bromphenol blue). Samples were boiled and fractionated on 10% SDS-PAGE as above. Anti-Ku70 monoclonal antibodies N3H10 (Neomarkers) and AG4–7.5 were used similarly. c-Abl binding to in vitro translated DNA-PKcs polypeptides was tested as above with 5 μg of GST-c-Abl, GST, or GST-c-Abl-SH3 in 20 μl of MB (10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, 100 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, leupeptin, and aprotinin) with equal amounts of in vitro translation product for 1–2 h at 4 °C. GST beads (10 μl) were added for 30 min with occasional resuspension and then washed four times in 1 ml of MB at 4 °C. Samples were prepared for 10% SDS-PAGE as above. GST-DNA-PKcs 7, 8, and 9 (2 μg) were mixed with GST-c-Abl (1 μg) and incubated at 30 °C in 1 × kinase buffer (25 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 75 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 10 mmMnCl2, 50 μm ATP and γ-32P-ATP, 0.4 mm EGTA, 0.2 mm EDTA, 1 mmdithiothreitol). Samples were diluted by half in 2 × SB, boiled, and then fractionated on 10% SDS-PAGE followed by drying and autoradiography. 293 cells (5 × 106) were lysed in 0.5 ml of Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer on ice for 30 min and centrifuged in a Beckman J18.1 rotor at 13,000 rpm for 15 min. Cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-Ku80 antibody, GE2-9.5, on ice for 60 min, bound to Protein A-Sepharose at 4 °C for 30 min, and washed four times with 1 ml of Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer and twice with 1 ml 1 × kinase buffer. Protein A beads for each sample were divided into two equal aliquots. Kinase reactions were conducted in 25 μl with or without addition of c-Abl (thrombin-cleaved GST-c-Abl protein) in 1 × c-Abl kinase buffer, [γ-32P]ATP, and ATP to 100 μm at 30 °C for 10 min. Reactions were microcentrifuged, the supernatant was quantitatively removed, and pellets were washed twice in 100 μl of Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer. Next supernatant and bead fractions were resuspended to equal volumes of 1 × SB, boiled, and fractionated on SDS-PAGE. Immunoprecipitations were conducted with anti-Ku80 antibody, GE2–9.5, for 60 min on ice, followed by absorption onto Protein A-Sepharose. Protein A beads were washed twice in Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer, resuspended in 20 μl of 1 × SB, boiled for 5 min, and fractionated on SDS-PAGE. Proteins were transferred to polyvinylpyrrolidene difluoride membranes (NEN Life Science Products) by using a Bio-Rad semi-dry electrophoretic transfer apparatus at 20 V for 45 min in 48 mm Tris-Cl, 39 mm glycine, 1.3 mm SDS, 20% methanol, pH 9.2. Blots were blocked in PBS + 3% bovine serum albumin overnight. Primary antibodies, polyclonal anti-DNA-PK antisera (Ab145, courtesy of Carl Anderson), or anti-Ku70 (M19, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) were used at 1–2 μg/ml in PBS for 60 min. Blots were then washed five times in PBS + 0.2% Tween 20, incubated with Protein A/G-horseradish peroxidase (Pierce) for 30–40 min in PBS + 1% bovine serum albumin, and extensively washed in PBS + 0.2% Tween 20. Blots were developed using a Chemiluminescence Renaissance Kit (NEN Life Science Products). To determine the epitopes governing Ku association with DNA-PKcs, fragments of the DNA-PKcs polypeptide were prepared from mouse DNA-PKcs cDNAs. Fourteen different DNA-PKcs fragments, representing the entire open reading frame (Fig. 1), were synthesized byin vitro transcription/translation. Each in vitrotranslation reaction produced a polypeptide of the expected size by SDS-PAGE (data not shown). As a source of Ku, 293 cell lysates were prepared by high salt extraction that disassociates Ku from DNA-PKcs, but does not disrupt the Ku heterodimer (9Milne G.T. Jin S. Shannon K. Weaver D.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4189-4198Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar, 17Suwa A. Hirakata M. Takeda Y. Jesch S.A. Mimori T. Hardin J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 6904-6908Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar, 18Boubnov N.V. Hall K.T. Wills Z. Lee S.E. He D.M. Benjamin D.M. Pulaski C.R. Band H. Reeves W. Hendrickson E.A. Weaver D.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 890-894Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Following co-incubation of in vitro translation products with lysates at 150 mmNaCl, immunoprecipitations were formed with the anti-Ku antibody, GE2-9.5, absorbed to Protein A-Sepharose, and then extensively washed. In parallel, the in vitro translation products were incubated with 293 lysates and Protein A-Sepharose alone was compared. We found that DNA-PKcs-8 and DNA-PKcs-10 (amino acids 3414–3850 and 3002–3450, respectively) yielded significantly greater co-immunoprecipitated translation products than each of the other DNA-PK fragments or the Protein A only controls (Fig.2). Also, DNA-PKcs-8 and DNA-PKcs-10 translation products were not immunoprecipitated with GE2-9.5 without addition of the 293 cell lysate (data not shown). DNA-PKcs-9 showed increased binding, but equal binding to the Protein A negative control, arguing that this association is not specific to Ku. A specific association between Ku and DNA-PKcs-8 and -10 was also observed with two anti-Ku70 monoclonal antibodies, N3H10 and AG4-7.5 (data not shown). Thus, Ku binds to DNA-PKcs through an 848-amino acid region at least partially overlapping the protein kinase homology domain. The Ku binding region is N-terminal to conserved residues that are likely to be involved in phosphotransfer catalysis for DNA-PK (motifs DXXXXN, amino acids 3917–3922, and DFG, amino acids 3936–3938, respectively (4Hartley K.O. Gell D. Smith G.C.M. Zhang H. Dvecha N. Connelly M.A. Admon A. Lees-Miller S.P. Anderson C.W. Jackson S.P. Cell. 1995; 82: 849-856Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (669) Google Scholar, 19Hunter T. Cell. 1995; 83: 1-4Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar)). Therefore, Ku association might contribute to structural changes activating the nearby kinase core domain or make it more available to protein substrates. We tested the localization of c-Abl binding to DNA-PKcs in a similar manner as for Ku. Equal quantities of DNA-PKcs in vitro translation products were incubated with 5 μg of GST-c-Abl or GST proteins (Fig.3 B), absorbed onto glutathione-Sepharose beads, and washed. We observed specific binding of c-Abl to DNA-PKcs fragments 8, 9, and 10 (Fig. 3 A). Likewise, DNA-PKcs-15, spanning fragments 8 + 9 and including the entire kinase homology domain, also associated with c-Abl. GST protein and beads gave relatively weak binding to these and other fragments. DNA-PKcs-11 bound to GST-c-Abl and GST equally indicating an association that was not specific to c-Abl. Thus, c-Abl binds to the entire carboxyl terminus of DNA-PKcs (3002–4124) including the kinase homology domain. The carboxyl-terminal DNA-PKcs fragments 8, 9, and 10 were also examined for binding to the c-Abl SH3 domain, as we previously showed that c-Abl and DNA-PKcs in part associate via c-Abl SH3 (13Kharbanda S. Pandey P. Jin S. Inoue S. Bharti A. Yuan Z.-M. Weichselbaum R. Weaver D. Kufe D. Nature. 1997; 386: 732-735Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). We found that GST-c-Abl-SH3 strongly binds to DNA-PK fragment 8, but not appreciably with either fragments 9 or 10 (Fig. 3 C). Therefore, the association between c-Abl and DNA-PKcs may occur by multiple binding sites: c-Abl-SH3 with 3414–3850 and additional c-Abl epitopes with 3002–3450 and 3757–4124. c-Abl phosphorylation of C-terminal DNA-PK fragments was also studiedin vitro. GST fusion proteins of DNA-PK-7, -8, and -9 were isolated. DNA-PKcs fragment 8, which binds to c-Abl and Ku, was most actively phosphorylated in vitro by c-Abl (GST-DNAPK-8, Fig.4 A). DNA-PK-9 is not appreciably phosphorylated by c-Abl, and DNA-PK-7, which is not stably associated with c-Abl in vitro compared with DNA-PKcs-8, has lower phosphorylation levels. DNA-PK-8 phosphorylation is significantly lower than GST-CRK (amino acids 120–225), another substrate that stably binds to c-Abl (20Feller S.M. Knudsen B. Hanafusa H. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2341-2351Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar) (data not shown). c-Abl deleted for its SH3 domain (c-Abl-ΔSH3) phosphorylated DNA-PK-8 as effectively as c-Abl (Fig. 4 A). Thus, although c-Abl may utilize the SH3 domain as part of its interaction with the kinase domain of DNA-PKcs, there is no requirement for this domain in phosphorylating DNA-PK polypeptide substrates. c-Abl kinase could inhibit DNA-PK by phosphorylation that may or may not induce disassociation of the DNA-PK complex. To examine this issue, we isolated DNA-PK by anti-Ku80 immunoprecipitation from 293 cell lysates. Following washing and resuspension in kinase buffer, active c-Abl was added with [γ-32P]ATP. To ensure that phosphorylation was not due to DNA-PK, wortmannin was added to inhibit DNA-PK (4Hartley K.O. Gell D. Smith G.C.M. Zhang H. Dvecha N. Connelly M.A. Admon A. Lees-Miller S.P. Anderson C.W. Jackson S.P. Cell. 1995; 82: 849-856Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (669) Google Scholar). Beads were then centrifuged, and the supernatant and bead fractions were separated by 5% SDS-PAGE. We observed that all of the phosphorylated DNA-PKcs was released from Ku in the immunoprecipitation complexes (Fig. 4 B). In the absence of c-Abl, wortmannin completely inhibited DNA-PK autophosphorylation (Fig. 4 B). Similarly, Ku and DNA-PKcs are retained within the Ku immunoprecipitates incubated in kinase buffer without c-Abl as evidenced by immunoblotting with anti-DNA-PK and anti-Ku antibodies (Fig. 4 C). Therefore, c-Abl activity disassociates DNA-PK into separate Ku and DNA-PKcs components. Unlike Ku, c-Abl appears to negatively regulate DNA-PK (13Kharbanda S. Pandey P. Jin S. Inoue S. Bharti A. Yuan Z.-M. Weichselbaum R. Weaver D. Kufe D. Nature. 1997; 386: 732-735Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). Down-modulation of DNA-PK activity by c-Abl and possibly other proteins may occur during normal cell growth. Alternatively, c-Abl interactions may play an important role in radiation responses by truncating DNA damage signaling to the time immediately following the recognition of chromosome breaks. In such a capacity, DNA-PK complexes would have to reform at new DNA damage sites to reinitiate a signaling step. Thus, DNA repair functions of DNA-PK may not require the full activity of both DNA-PKcs and Ku components all of the time. DNA-PK autophosphorylation also inactivates DNA-PK in a mechanism where each component of the heterotrimeric complex is phosphorylated and Ku disassociates from DNA-PKcs (21Chan D.W. Lees-Miller S.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8936-8941Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). Autophosphorylation of the catalytic subunit rather than Ku specifically inactivates DNA-PK, since only unphosphorylated DNA-PKcs can restore DNA-PK activity in addback experiments (21Chan D.W. Lees-Miller S.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8936-8941Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). Possibly the sites of autophosphorylation and c-Abl phosphorylation are in the same carboxyl-terminal region of DNA-PKcs, as both mechanisms appear to affect Ku association in a similar way. Atm, the ataxia telangiectasia gene product, is a protein kinase related to DNA-PK (22Keegan K.S. Holtzman D.A. Plug A.W. Christenson E.R. Brainerd E.E. Flaggs G. Bentley N.J. Taylor E.M. Meyn M.S. Moss S.B. Carr A.M. Ashley T. Hoekstra M.F. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2423-2437Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). Ataxia telangiectasia cells are also IR-sensitive and show chromosome instability defects (23Hawley R.S. Friend S. Genes Dev. 1997; 10: 2383-2388Crossref Scopus (65) Google Scholar). No activating proteins or additional subunits of Atm are known. Interestingly, Atm·c-Abl complexes have been found, and the kinase homology region of ATM is sufficient to activate c-Abl (24Shafman T. Khanna K.K. Kedar D. Yen T. Spring K. Cozlov S. Gatti M. Zhang N. Watters D. Egerton M. Shiloh Y. Kharbanda S. Kufe D. Lavin M. Nature. 1997; 387: 520-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar, 25Baskaran R. Wood L.D. Whitaker L.L. Canman C.E. Morgan S.E. Xu Y. Barlow C. Baltimore D. Wynshaw-Boris A. Kastan M.B. Wang J.Y.J. Nature. 1997; 387: 516-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar). Thus, it is likely that DNA-PKcs and Atm use similar epitopes for associations with the c-Abl protein. The position of Ku·DNA-PKcs binding also roughly corresponds to that of rapamycin-binding protein, FKBP12, to FRAP, another member of the PIK family (5Keith C.T. Schreiber S.L. Science. 1995; 270: 50-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar, 26Brown E.J. Albers M.W. Shin T.B. Ichikawa K. Keith C.T. Lane W.S. Schreiber S.L.

A. 1995; 92: 4947-4951Crossref PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar). FKBP12-rapamycin binding inhibits FRAP function on downstream targets such as p70 S6 kinase and cyclin-dependent kinases (28Brown E.J. Beal P.A. Keith C.T. Chen J. Shin T.B. Schreiber S.L. Nature. 1995; 377: 441-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (613) Google Scholar). Thus, the N-terminal regions flanking kinase homology domains of PIK family members may well be used as a general strategy for modulating kinase activity in vivo.

Gangliosides are amphipathic glycolipid molecules containing sialic acid and present abundantly in the nervous system of vertebrates (1Suzuki K. J.

Life Sci. 1994; 55: 2125-2134Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). However, molecular mechanisms by which gangliosides affect the functions of nervous system and regulate the cell growth and differentiation have not been well clarified. This is mainly because there have been no effective approaches to address those issues other than to observe the effects of exogenously added gangliosides to cultured cells or into experimental animals. These difficulties can now be dramatically overcome since a number of glycosyltransferase genes have been isolated (14Joziasse D.H. Shaper J.H. Van den Eijnden D.H. Van Tunen A.J. Shaper N.L. J.

It has also been reported that GM1 was involved in the receptor functions for peptide hormones such as follicle-stimulating hormone and luteinizing hormone (25Fishman P.H. Brady R.O. Science. 1976; 194: 906-915Crossref PubMed Scopus (577) Google Scholar), and was effective in the therapeutic applications of many pathological status of nervous system. For detailed analysis of the biological functions of complex gangliosides, the availability of genes of glycosyltransferases responsible for the synthesis of individual structures are essential. In the present study, we isolated a cDNA clone of β1,3-galactosyltransferase (EC 2.4.1.-) (β1,3Gal-T) gene, products of which determine the expression of GD1b. We demonstrated that this enzyme also catalyzes the synthesis of GM1 and asialo-GM1 (GA1) by introducing the cDNA into various cell lines with appropriate precursor structures, and byin vitro assay using extracts from the cDNA transfectant cells. The expression pattern of the gene among rat tissues and in rat brain during development was also investigated. Mouse cell line KF4C is a stable transfectant of KF3027 (26Nagata Y. Yamashiro S.

Chem. 1992; 267: 12082-12089Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with pSV2neo expressing asialo-GM2(GA2) (27Yamashiro S. Haraguchi M. Furukawa K. Takamiya K. Yamamoto A. Nagata Y. Lloyd K.O.

Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) specifically reactive with GD1b (mAb 370) and GA1 (mAb 229) were generated in our laboratory and will be described elsewhere. 2K. Furukawa, S. Fukumoto, and T. Shimomura, manuscript in preparation. A cDNA library of rat brain was prepared using poly(A)+ RNA and the pcDNAI expression vector (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA). This library contained 3.5 × 106 independent colonies. The strain of bacterial host used was Escherichia coli MC1061/P3. Plasmid pMIK/D3T-31 was constructed by inserting XhoI fragment of GD3 synthase cDNA clone, pD3T-31 (28Haraguchi M. Yamashiro S. Yamamoto A. Furukawa K. Takamiya K. Lloyd K.O. Shiku H. Furukawa K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 10455-10459Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar), into pMIK/Neo expression vector (kindly provided by Maruyama at Tokyo Medical Dental School). Plasmids of the cDNA library were once amplified and transfected into KF4C cells together with plasmid pMIK/D3T-31 using DEAE-dextran (Pharmacia Biotech, Uppsala, Sweden) as described previously (29Davis L.G. Dibner M.D. Battey J.F. Methods in Molecular Biology. Elsevier Science, New York1986: 285-289Google Scholar). Subconfluent KF4C cells, 1.5 × 106 in 10-cm dishes (Corning, Corning, NY), were co-transfected with 8 μg each of cDNA library plasmid and pMIK/D3T-31. After 60 h, the transfected cells were detached from plates and incubated with mAb 370 at a 1:200 dilution on ice for 45 min. Cells were plated on dishes coated with goat anti-mouse IgM (Cappel, Durham, NC) as described previously (30Wysocki L.J. Sato V.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1978; 75: 2844-2848Crossref PubMed Scopus (1151) Google Scholar). Plasmid DNA was rescued from the panned cells by preparing Hirt extracts and transformed into MC1061/P3. Expanded plasmid DNA was transfected again, and the same procedure was repeated four times more. Thereafter 96 pools containing 30 colonies each were prepared and screened by the expression of mAb 370 binding activity. Finally, 17 clones from two positive pools were screened, and three single colonies that directed the expression of GD1b on KF4C were isolated using microscale DEAE-dextran transfection and immunofluorescence assay. Isolated cDNA plasmid was digested byXhoI and HindIII and cloned into phagemid BlueScript (pBSK) KS(+) vector. Deletion mutants of this clone were prepared with a Kilo-Sequence deletion kit (Takara, Kyoto). Dideoxynucleotide termination sequencing was performed by either T3/T7 dye primers or four additional custom dideoxy terminators with the PRISM dye terminator cycle sequencing kit and model 377 DNA sequencer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). The mouse melanoma cell lines, KF4C and B78-2 expressing GM2, were used as recipient cells in the transient and stable expression systems. For transient expression of GM1, pM1T-9/cDNAI vector was transfected into KF4C by DEAE-dextran. For transient expression of GD1b, co-transfection of KF4C with pMIK-neo/D3T-31 and pM1T-9/cDNAI was performed. For transient expression of GA1, L1-17 cells expressing GA2 were transfected with pM1T-9/cDNAI. Expression of these gangliosides was detected by an immunofluorescence assay and flow cytometry. To prepare stable transfectants expressing GM1 and GD1b, pM1T-9/cDNAI and pMIK-Hyg/D3T-31 were co-transfected into B78-2 by calcium phosphate precipitation as described previously (31Davis L.G. Dibner M.D. Battey J.F. Methods in Molecular Biology. Elsevier Science, New York1986: 290-292Google Scholar). To select transfectants, the cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's minimal essential medium, 7.5% fetal calf serum containing G418 (300 μg/ml) and hygromycin (250 μg/ml). Expression of these gangliosides on stable transfectants was checked by immunofluorescence assay and flow cytometry. Ganglioside expression was analyzed using mouse mAb 370 (anti-GD1b), mAb 229 (anti-GA1), and FITC-conjugated cholera toxin B subunit (List Biological Laboratories, Campbell, CA). Cells were incubated with mAbs for 45 min on ice and stained with FITC-conjugated rabbit anti-mouse IgM for mAbs 370 and 229 for 45 min on ice. To analyze GM1 on cell surface, cells were incubated with FITC-conjugated cholera toxin B subunit for 45 min. Cells were analyzed by flow cytometry on a FACScan (Becton Dickinson, Mountain View, CA). Intensity of staining was measured in arbitrary units as the log of fluorescent intensity and displayed on a 4 decade scale. Control cells for flow cytometry were prepared by using only second antibody for GD1b and GA1. For GM1 expression, transfectants with vector only were used after staining with FITC-conjugated cholera toxin B subunit. RNA was extracted from adult rat tissues and embryonic rat brains using acid phenol (32Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63191) Google Scholar). Total RNA (20 μg) was separated on 1.2% agarose-formaldehyde gel, then transferred onto a GeneScreen Plus membrane (DuPont, Boston, MA). Hybridization with [α-32P]dCTP-labeled rat β1,3Gal-T cDNA(pM1T-9), or β-actin cDNA (nucleotides 69–814) probes was performed as described previously (26Nagata Y. Yamashiro S. Yodoi J. Lloyd K.O. Shiku H. Furukawa K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12082-12089Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), then analyzed by BAS 2000 Bio-Imaging Analyzer (Fuji Film, Tokyo). Stable transfectants of the β1,3Gal-T gene were obtained by co-transfecting KF4C melanoma with the cloned plasmid and pMIK-Hyg/D3T-31 (α2,8-sialyltransferase (α2,8S-T) cDNA) by calcium phosphate precipitation. Among G418- and hygromycin-resistant clones, GD1b-expressing clones were selected based upon the results in immunofluorescence assay and flow cytometry. Glycolipids were isolated as described previously (33Furukawa K. Clausen H. Hakomori S. Sakamoto J. Look K. Lundblad A. Mattes M.J. Lloyd K.O. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 7820-7826Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were extracted from about 300 μl of packed cells of transfectants and control clones containing the Hyg gene alone using chloroform/methanol (2:1, 1:1, 1:2) sequentially. After desalting, gangliosides were isolated by DEAE-Sephadex A-50 (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) ion exchange chromatography. TLC was performed on a high performance TLC plate (Merck, Darmstadt) using chloroform, methanol, 2.5 nNH4OH (60:35:8). The components were visualized by spraying with resorcinol. The identity of new gangliosides was confirmed by TLC immunostaining using aluminum-backed silica plates (Merck) as described previously (33Furukawa K. Clausen H. Hakomori S. Sakamoto J. Look K. Lundblad A. Mattes M.J. Lloyd K.O. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 7820-7826Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). After TLC, the plate was air-dried and transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. The plates were incubated with 1% bovine serum albumin in phosphate-buffered saline for 1 h to block nonspecific binding. Then, the membrane was incubated with mAbs for 1 h at room temperature, then with rabbit biotinized anti-mouse IgG and avidin-biotin complex, Vectastain ABC-PO Kit (Vector Laboratories) was used. To visualize specific binding of mAbs, Konica stain kit (Konica, Tokyo) was used. The enzyme activity of β1,3Gal-T was measured as described previously (34Ruan S. Lloyd K.O. Cancer Res. 1992; 52: 5725-5731PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, to prepare membrane fractions, samples were lysed using a nitrogen cavitation apparatus. Nuclei were removed by low-speed centrifugation and the supernatant was centrifuged at 105,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C. To analyze the enzyme activity of β1,3Gal-T, the reaction mixture contained the following in a volume of 50 μl: 150 mmsodium cacodylate-HCl (pH 7.0), 15 mm MnCl2, 0.375% Triton CF-54 (Sigma), 325 mm GM2 (for GM1 synthesis), 400 mm UDP-Gal (Sigma), UDP-[14C]Gal (2.0 × 105 dpm) (NEN Life Science Products, Boston, MA), and membranes containing 100 μg of protein. After incubation for 2 h at 37 °C, the products were isolated by a C18 Sep-Pak cartridge (Waters, Milford, MA) and analyzed by TLC and fluorography as described (35Yamashiro S. Ruan S. Furukawa K. Tai T. Lloyd K.O. Shiku H. Furukawa K. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 5395-5400PubMed Google Scholar). Nucleotide and amino acid sequence homology search was carried out using the internet program BLAST (National Center for Biotechnology Information). Amino acid sequence and hydropathy analysis were performed with a software GENETYX-MAC version 6.1.0 (Software Development, Tokyo). To isolate cDNA clone of GD1b synthase gene, we prepared transfectant lines of KF3027 with β1,4-N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase (β1,4GalNAc-T) cDNA, pM2T1–1, resulting in a new acceptor cell line expressing GM2. This line was named KF4C. Thus, we can expect expression of GD1b after co-transfection of α2,8S-T cDNA, pD3T-31, and β1,3Gal-T cDNA in the library as shown in Fig. 1. After 5 cycles of transfection of cDNA library, panning by anti-GD1b mAb 370 and Hirt extraction, a cDNA clone designated as pM1T-9 was isolated. After co-transfection of pM1T-9 with pD3T-31 into KF4C, new expression of GD1b was observed as shown in Fig. 2 B. In these transient transfectant cells, GM1 was also newly expressed when stained by FITC-conjugated cholera toxin B as shown in Fig.2 A. Therefore, it was strongly suggested that GD1b synthase and GM1 synthase were identical and coded by a single gene as previously reported by Sandhoff's group (36Iber H. Kaufmann R. Pohlentz G. Schwarzmann G. Sandhoff K. FEBS Lett. 1989; 248: 18-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). To confirm this point, KF4C was transfected with pM1T-9 alone, then examined the expression of GD1b and GM1. These transfectants expressed GM1, but not GD1b, corresponding with the proposed pathway of ganglioside synthesis (36Iber H. Kaufmann R. Pohlentz G. Schwarzmann G. Sandhoff K. FEBS Lett. 1989; 248: 18-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Furthermore, this enzyme has been thought to be identical with GA1 synthase which catalyze the synthesis of GA1 from GA2. L cell transfected with pM2T1-1 was, therefore, used as a recipient cell of pM1T-9 to examine the synthesis of GA1 by the transfection of this cDNA, since L cell lacked all complex gangliosides due to the lack of GM3 synthase activity (27Yamashiro S. Haraguchi M. Furukawa K. Takamiya K. Yamamoto A. Nagata Y. Lloyd K.O. Shiku H. Furukawa K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6149-6155Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2, L cells transfected by pM2T1-1 (stable) and pM1T-9 (transient) definitely expressed GA1 as demonstrated by a GA1 specific mAb 229. We established stable transfectant cells of pM1T-9 or pM1T-9 and pMIK/D3T-31 using B78-2 (a B78 transfectant line with pM2T1-1). Flow cytometry analysis clearly demonstrated new and significant levels of synthesis of GM1 (Fig.3 B) or GM1/GD1b (Fig. 3 D). Glycosphingolipids extracted from the parent cell (B78/M2T1-1), and a double transfectant (B78/M2T1-1/M1T-9/D3T-31) were analyzed by TLC, and conversion of glycolipid components as expected were observed (Fig.4). Specific GD1b bands were demonstrated in the double transfectant cells by TLC immunostaining. These results certainly indicated that the cloned cDNA pM1T-9 actually derived from the GD1b/GM1/GA1 synthase gene.Figure 4TLC of gangliosides extracted from stable transfectant cells. A, gangliosides were extracted as described under “Materials and Methods” from B78 (lanes 1 and 2), B78-2 (lane 3), and B78-2/M1T-9/D3T-31 (lane 4), then separated in TLC.Lane 1 was gangliosides from 10 mg of wet tissue, andlanes 2–4 were from 5 mg. St, ganglioside mixture from bovine brain as a standard. Solvent used was chloroform, methanol, 2.5 n NH4Cl (60:35:8). Resorcinol spray was performed for the detection of bands.

Lanes 3 and4 were prepared as in A, then blotted and stained by anti-GD1b mAb 370 as described under “Materials and Methods”.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Fig.5 shows whole sequence of the insert of pM1T-9 determined by sequence analysis of the constructs of pBSK containing the HindIII-XhoI fragment of clone between HindIII and XhoI sites. Compared with other glycosyltransferase cDNAs isolated so far, this cDNA was relatively small in size, i.e. total size was 1613 base pairs comprising a 194-base pair 5′-untranslated region, a continuous open reading frame of 1113 base pairs, and a 306-base pair 3′-untranslated region. A single polyadenylation signal and a polyadenylation region of more than 70 As were present. The initiation codon at the beginning of the open reading frame is embedded within a sequence similar to the Kozak consensus initiation sequence (37Kozak M. Cell. 1986; 44: 283-292Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3590) Google Scholar, 38Kozak M. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 229-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (2810) Google Scholar). This open reading frame predicts a 371-amino acid protein with a molecular mass of 40,976.1 daltons. Search of currently available protein and nucleic acid data bases identified no other gene with significant sequence homology to this cDNA. Even the sequences of four other galactosyltransferase genes, i.e. α1,3Gal-T (14Joziasse D.H. Shaper J.H. Van den Eijnden D.H. Van Tunen A.J. Shaper N.L. J. Biol.

Chem. 1990; 265: 1146-1151Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) showed only 10∼16% homology in amino acid sequence. Inspection and hydropathy of the predicted protein sequence, however, suggested that this protein has a similar structural organization to those of known glycosyltransferases (Fig.5). There is a single hydrophobic segment near the amino terminus which comprised of 21 amino acids. This putative signal anchor sequence would place 4 residues within the cytosolic compartment and 346 amino acids within the Golgi lumen as a catalytic domain. The predicted amino acid sequence indicated the presence of single N-glycosylation site at 143–145, and a proline-rich region at 42–71 (11/30) amino acid residues. Based on the results of transient and stable transfection of pM1T-9, it was strongly expected that this gene codes for a single β1,3Gal-T catalyzing the synthesis of three structures, i.e.GD1b, GM1, and GA1. The membrane fraction of the stable transfectant cells were examined for enzyme activity. As shown in Fig. 6 A, the membrane fraction from a stable transfectant of B78 with pMIK/M1T-9 and pD3T-31 showed ∼20,000 units (pmol/h/mg of protein) of GM1 synthase activity, while it showed no significant products when no acceptor was added. As expected, that from a transfectant with pMIK vector alone showed almost null activity. When GD2, GA2, GlcCer, GD1b, GM3, or GD1a were examined as substrates, GD2 and GA2 showed significant levels of incorporation of UDP-Gal (Fig. 6 B). Expression levels of the β1,3Gal-T gene in various rat tissues were examined by Northern blots using total RNA. Among various tissues, kidney, testis, spleen, and thymus showed relatively high expression levels, whereas almost all tissues examined contained some levels of the gene transcripts (Fig.7 A). Gene expression in the brain tissue of adult rat was not especially high. When the gene expression was analyzed during the development of rat brain, this gene was already detected at day 12 of embryonic brain, and the expression level was maintained at high levels until birth (Fig. 7, Band C). In the adult brain, the expression level was maintained at low levels. Since Narimatsu et al. (15Narimatsu H. Sinha S. Brew K. Okayama H. Qasba P.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 4720-4724Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar) isolated cDNA of the β1,4-galactosyltransferase gene in 1986, a number of glycosyltransferase genes of mammals and birds have been cloned. Except for ceramide:β1,4-galactosyltransferase (16Schulte S. Stoffel W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 10265-10269Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar, 44Stahl N. Jurevics H. Morell P. Suzuki K. Popko B. J. Neurosci. Res. 1994; 38: 234-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) and ceramide:β1,4-glucosyltransferase (45Ichikawa S. Sakiyama H. Suzuki G. Hidari K.I. Hirabayashi Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 4638-4643Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar), the majority of them were type II membrane proteins. The β1,3Gal-T reported in this paper which uses glycolipid acceptors also showed a typical type II orientation with a very short cytoplasmic tail of 4 amino acids. Based on competitive enzymologic studies, Sandhoff and collegues (36Iber H. Kaufmann R. Pohlentz G. Schwarzmann G. Sandhoff K. FEBS Lett. 1989; 248: 18-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) suggested that GM1/GD1b/GA1synthases were identical, as were GM2/GD2/GA2 synthases (46Pohlentz G. Klein D. Schwarzmann G. Schmitz D. Sandhoff K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 7044-7048Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). They, therefore, proposed that the synthesis of complex gangliosides was regulated mainly at the levels of GM3 → GD3→ GT3 synthesis. The identity of GM2/GD2/GA2 synthase genes was previously demonstrated by us (26Nagata Y. Yamashiro S. Yodoi J. Lloyd K.O. Shiku H. Furukawa K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12082-12089Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 27Yamashiro S. Haraguchi M. Furukawa K. Takamiya K. Yamamoto A. Nagata Y. Lloyd K.O. Shiku H. Furukawa K. J. Biol.

Biophys. 1995; 323: 11-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) using substrate specificity analysis of the β1,4GalNAc-T gene product and by transfections of the cDNA. The identity of GD1b/GM1/GA1 synthase gene was demonstrated in this study by isolation of GD1b synthase cDNA and the demonstration that its product can use glycolipids containing GalNAcβ1→4Gal-, GalNAcβ1→4(NeuAcα2→3)Gal-, or GalNAcβ1→4(NeuAcα2→8NeuAcα2→3)Gal-terminal sequences as acceptors. In the case of GM2/GD2synthase (27Yamashiro S. Haraguchi M. Furukawa K. Takamiya K. Yamamoto A. Nagata Y. Lloyd K.O. Shiku H. Furukawa K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6149-6155Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), GA2 synthesis was relatively low when compared on the basis of substrate specificity analysis. On the other hand, acceptor activity of β1,3Gal-T with GM2, GD2, and GA2 was not so different (Fig.6 B), although further analysis remains to be performed. As mentioned above, gangliosides have been expected to play important roles in the development of vertebrate nervous system (4Bouvier J.D. Seyfried T.N. J. Neurochem. 1989; 52: 460-466Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). GM1 in particular has been rigorously studied for its biological effects in vivo and in vitro. Its effects on the repairment of lesioned nerves with toxic agents, ischemic damages, degenerative diseases, and mechanical operations have been reported (5Favaron M. Manev H. Alho H. Bertolino M. Ferret B. Guidotti A. Costa E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 7351-7355Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar, 12Karpiak S.E. Adv. Exp. Med.

Science. 1984; 225: 340-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). In the in vitro culture systems, addition of GM1 ganglioside could induce and/or augment neurite extension (49Seifert W. Rapport M.M. Gorio A. Gangliosides in Neurological and Neuromuscular Function, Develoment, and Repair. Raven Press, New York1981: 99-117Google Scholar, 50Roisen F.J. Bartfeld H. Nagele R. Yorke G.

However, the biological significance of gangliosides can be investigated more physiologically by the genetic modification of their glycosyltransferase genes. Mice lacking complex gangliosides following the disruption of the β1,4GalNAc-T gene showed definite dysfunctions in the nervous systems such as reduced nerve conduction velocity (23Takamiya K. Yamamoto A. Furukawa K. Yamashiro S. Shin M. Okada M. Fukumoto S. Haraguchi M. Takeda N. Fujimura K. Sakae M. Kishikawa M. Shiku H. Furukawa K. Aizawa S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Furukawa, manuscript in preparation. The high expression of β1,3Gal-T gene observed only during the developmental stage of rat brain suggests an important role for its ganglioside products in the formation and differentiation of brain tissues. Genetic manipulation of β1,3Gal-T gene would enable us to finely analyze the roles of individual complex gangliosides higher than GD1b/GM1/GA1. We thank Dr. Kenneth O. Lloyd at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center for carefully reading the manuscript and Y. Honda and T. Shimomura for excellent technical assistance."

One important mechanism of aminoglycoside modification is through ATP-dependentO-phosphorylation, catalyzed by a family of aminoglycoside kinases. The structure of one of these kinases, APH(3′)-IIIa has recently been determined by x-ray crystallography, and the general fold is strikingly similar to eukaryotic protein kinases (Hon, W.

Based on this similarity, we have examined the effect of known inhibitors of eukaryotic protein kinases on two aminoglycoside kinases, APH(3′)-IIIa and the enzyme AAC(6′)-APH(2"") which also exhibits acetyl-CoA-dependent aminoglycoside modification activity. We report that several known protein kinase inhibitors are also good inhibitors of aminoglycoside kinases. Compounds belonging to the isoquinolinesulfonamide group are especially effective in this regard, giving competitive inhibition in the micromolar range with respect to ATP and noncompetitive inhibitionversus the aminoglycoside substrate.

Compounds belonging to the isoquinolinesulfonamide group are especially effective in this regard, giving competitive inhibition in the micromolar range with respect to ATP and noncompetitive inhibitionversus the aminoglycoside substrate. This study provides the basis for future aminoglycoside kinase inhibitor design and for the development of compounds which could reverse antibiotic resistance in the clinic. Bacterial resistance to antibiotics continues to escalate and is widely recognized as a serious health threat (1American Society for MicrobiologyReport of the ASM Task Force on the Antibiotic Resistance. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D. C.1995Google Scholar, 2Gold H.S. Moellering Jr., R.C. N. Engl. J. Med. 1996; 335: 1445-1453Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar). Aminoglycoside antibiotics are an important group of antimicrobials which are used primarily to treat infections in the clinic due to the fact that parenteral rather than oral administration is required to obtain sufficient serum concentrations for effective control of bacterial infections (3Edson R.S. Terrell C.L. Mayo Clin. Proc. 1991; 66: 1158-1164Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). A major advantage to these cationic antibiotics is the fact that, despite the generally accepted view that these drugs target the bacterial ribosome, they have a bactericidal effect. This is thought to be the result of membrane damage effects which occur after impairment of ribosome function (4Davis B.D. Microbiol. Rev. 1987; 51: 341-350Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Aminoglycoside therapy is especially important for the treatment of serious enterococcal infections where it is required to achieve synergistic killing when co-administered with a penicillin (5Murray B.E. Clin. Microbiol. Rev. 1990; 3: 46-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (1483) Google Scholar). Clinical resistance to the aminoglycosides is generally the result of the synthesis of modifying enzymes, which can use ATP to either phosphorylate or adenylate the drugs, or acetyl-CoA to acetylate them (6Shaw K.J. Rather P.N. Hare R.S. Miller G.H. Microbiol. Rev. 1993; 57: 138-163Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7Davies J. Wright G.D. Trends Microbiol. 1997; 5: 234-240Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). These modified aminoglycosides are no longer effective antibiotics and thus the cells manifest a resistance phenotype. There are well over 50 aminoglycoside-modifying enzymes that have been characterized at the gene level (6Shaw K.J. Rather P.N. Hare R.S. Miller G.H. Microbiol. Rev. 1993; 57: 138-163Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7Davies J. Wright G.D. Trends Microbiol. 1997; 5: 234-240Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). In the aminoglycoside kinase family (APH), 1The abbreviations used are: APH, aminoglycoside phosphotransferase; AAC, aminoglycoside acetyltransferase; CKI-7,N-(2-aminoethyl)-5-chloroisoquinoline-8-sulfonamide; CKI-8, 1-(5-chloroisoquinoline-8-sulfonyl)piperazine; H-7, 1-(5-isoquinolinesulfonyl)-2-methylpiperazine; H-9,N-(2-aminoethyl)-5-isoquinolinesulfonamide; HA-1004,N-(2-guanidinoethyl)-5-isoquinolinesulfonamide. the deduced amino acid sequences show relatively low overall similarity (10–50%), but they do share conserved sequences, primarily in the C-terminal region. Of particular importance is the sequence H(G/N)DX 3–4N, a homologue of which is also found in eukaryotic Ser/Thr and Tyr protein kinases: (H/Y)RDX 4N. The significance of this short peptide lies in the fact that the conserved Asp is required for catalysis in protein kinases and most likely acts as an active site base deprotonating the substrate hydroxyl group to permit effective phosphoryl transfer (8Cole P.A. Grace M.R. Phillips R.S. Burn P. Walsh C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22105-22108Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 9Madhusudan Trafny E.A. Xuong N.-H. Adams J.A. Ten Eyck L.F. Taylor S.S. Sowadski J.M. Protein Sci. 1994; 3: 176-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). We have recently determined the three-dimensional structure of the enterococcal aminoglycoside kinase, APH(3′)-IIIa and found that the overall structure of the enzyme is highly similar to eukaryotic protein kinases (Fig.1) (10Hon W.C. McKay G.A. Thompson P.R. Sweet R.M. Yang D.S.C. Wright G.D. Berghuis A.M. Cell. 1997; 89: 887-895Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). Site-directed mutagenesis of the conserved Asp-190 resulted in a dramatic reduction of enzyme activity, consistent with an important role of this residue in catalysis as is the case with the corresponding Asp residues in eukaryotic protein kinases (10Hon W.C. McKay G.A. Thompson P.R. Sweet R.M. Yang D.S.C. Wright G.D. Berghuis A.M. Cell. 1997; 89: 887-895Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). Our previous work had demonstrated as well that APH(3′)-IIIa, like protein kinases, operates by an associative phosphoryl transfer mechanism by direct attack of the nucleophilic hydroxyl group on the γ-phosphate of ATP (11Thompson P.R. Hughes D.W. Wright G.D. Chem. Biol. 1996; 3: 747-755Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Thus, this aminoglycoside kinase shares a similar three-dimensional fold and chemical mechanism with eukaryotic protein kinases. In view of the fact that all aminoglycoside kinases have the H(G/N)DX 3–4N catalytic sequence, it is not unreasonable to predict that they will also share a similar kinase fold. Of particular interest to us is AAC(6′)-APH(2""), an enzyme with both aminoglycoside acetyltransferase and kinase activities harbored by many aminoglycoside-resistant staphylococci and enterococci (12Ferretti J.J. Gilmore K.S. Courvalin P. J. Bacteriol. 1986; 167: 631-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar, 13Rouch D.A. Byrne M.E. Kong Y.C. Skurray R.A. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1987; 133: 3039-3052PubMed Google Scholar). This enzyme confers high level resistance (minimal inhibitory concentration >1,000 μg/ml) to a broad range of clinically important aminoglycosides including gentamicin, tobramycin, and amikacin. The close mechanistic and three-dimensional structural relationship between APH(3′)-IIIa and protein kinases have led us to explore the sensitivity of aminoglycoside kinases to known inhibitors of protein kinases. Kinase inhibitors of three classes, the indole carbazoles, the flavanoids, and the isoquinolinesulfonamides (Fig.2) were examined. The latter were found to be good inhibitors of two aminoglycoside kinases, APH(3′)-IIIa and AAC(6′)-APH(2""). This study thus provides the basis for future inhibitor designs, which could lead to compounds that reverse antibiotic resistance. Genistein, quercetin, and staurosporine were from Sigma. N-(2-Aminoethyl)-5-chloroisoquinoline-8-sulfonamide (CKI-7) and 1-(5-chloroisoquinoline-8-sulfonyl)piperazine (CKI-8) were from Seikagaku America (Rockville, MD). 1-(5-Isoquinolinesulfonyl)-2-methylpiperazine (H-7),N-(2-aminoethyl)-5-isoquinolinesulfonamide (H-9), andN-(2-guanidinoethyl)-5-isoquinolinesulfonamide (HA-1004) were from Research Biochemicals International (Nattick, MA). APH(3′)-IIIa and AAC(6′)-APH(2"") were purified as described previously (14McKay G.A. Thompson P.R. Wright G.D. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 6936-6944Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). 2D. M. Daigle and G. D. Wright, submitted for publication. Aminoglycoside kinase activity was monitored by coupling of ADP release to NADH oxidation by pyruvate kinase and lactate dehydrogenase in the presence of excess phosphoenolpyruvate (14McKay G.A. Thompson P.R. Wright G.D. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 6936-6944Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar).2 Assays were performed at 37 °C and contained kanamycin A (0.12 mm) when ATP was the variable substrate, 0.28 mm NADH, 2.5 mmphosphoenolpyruvate, 5 units of lactate dehydrogenase, 3.5 units of pyruvate kinase, 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, and inhibitor dissolved in water or dimethyl sulfoxide in the case of the isoflavanoid compounds. The amount of dimethyl sulfoxide in the reaction mixture never exceeded 5% (v/v) and did not affect the APH(3′)-IIIa activity but did diminish the activity of AAC(6′)-APH(2""). Reactions were initiated by the addition of 0.5 nmol of purified APH(3′)-IIIa or 0.21 nmol of pure AAC(6′)-APH(2""). For experiments with varying kanamycin A, ATP was held at 1 mm. Inhibition constants were determined by fitting data determined in duplicate at at least four different inhibitor concentrations to Equation 1 for competitive inhibition or Equations 2 or 3 for non-competitive inhibition using Grafit version 3.0 software (16Leatherbarrow, R.

Thompson P.R. Wright G.D. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 6936-6944Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar).) The indole carbazole containing alkaloid staurosporine did not inhibit either APH(3′)-IIIa or AAC(6′)-APH(2"") at 0.7–0.1 μm concentration (Table I). This compound is a potent inhibitor of protein kinase C and many eukaryotic protein kinases with K i values generally below 10 nm (17Herbert J.M. Seban E. Maffrand J.P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1990; 171: 189-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). The current evidence supports binding of staurosporine at the ATP site of protein kinases (17Herbert J.M. Seban E. Maffrand J.P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1990; 171: 189-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Despite the fact that the general structure of the ATP site is shared between APH(3′)-IIIa and protein kinases, this is not translated in similar affinity for staurosporine.Table IEffects of protein kinase inhibitors on APH(3′)-IIIa and AAC(6′)-APH(2"")InhibitorVariable substratePattern1-aC, competitive; NC, noncompetitive.K isK iiEquation1-bData fit to equations under “Experimental Procedures.”μmμmAPH(3′)-IIIa CKI-7ATPC66.1 ± 7.51 CKI-8ATPC290 ± 891 H-7ATPC730 ± 1301 H-9ATPC138 ± 401 H-9Kanamycin ANC155 ± 26260 ± 193 HA-1004ATPC48.9 ± 12.31 GenisteinATP—1-cNo inhibition at 250 μm.

Open table in a new tab The flavanoids genistein and quercetin have been shown to be inhibitors of the epidermal growth factor receptor kinase and other Tyr kinases and are competitive with ATP (18Akiyama T.

Genistein did not inhibit either APH(3′)-IIIa or AAC(6′)-APH(2""), but the related compound quercetin showed modest inhibition of APH(3′)-IIIa which was competitive with ATP (Table I). The isoquinolinesulfonamide inhibitors are well known competitive inhibitors of ATP for many protein kinases (19Hidaka H. Kobayashi R. Hardie D.G. Protein Phosphorylation. A Practical Approach. Oxford University Press, Oxford1993: 87-107Google Scholar, 20Hidaka H. Inagaki M. Kawamoto S. Sasaki Y. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 5036-5041Crossref PubMed Scopus (2329) Google Scholar, 21Casnellie J.E. Adv. Pharm. 1991; 22: 167-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Remarkable target specificity has been reported to be achieved by varying the side chain and the placement of the isoquinoline ring nitrogen (reviewed in Ref.19Hidaka H. Kobayashi R. Hardie D.G. Protein Phosphorylation. A Practical Approach. Oxford University Press, Oxford1993: 87-107Google Scholar). Thus H-9 is an inhibitor of protein kinase C, whereas CKI-7, which differs only by the placement of the ring nitrogen from position 5 to 8 and the presence of a chlorine atom linked to C-5 (Fig. 2), is a potent inhibitor of casein kinases. Recent x-ray crystallographic structures of CKI-7 bound to casein kinase (22Xu R.-M. Carmel G. Kuret J. Cheng X. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 6308-6313Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) and H-7,N-(2-(methylamino)ethyl)-5-isoquinolinesulfonamide (H-8), andN-(2-(p-bromocinnamylamino)ethyl)-5-isoquinolinesulfonamide (H-89) complexed with cAMP-dependent protein kinase (23Engh R.A. Girod A. Kinzel V. Huber R. Bossemeyer D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26157-26164Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar) have demonstrated the structural basis for inhibition of protein kinases by this family of compounds. A key element which is common to both CKI-7 and the H-series inhibitor protein complexes is a common hydrogen bond between the isoquinoline ring nitrogen and a main chain amide hydrogen. An equivalent hydrogen bond is also made between N-1 of ATP in the substrate·enzyme complex and the same amide hydrogen, thus the isoquinoline and the purine rings occupy the same binding pocket and employ identical positioning elements when bound to protein kinases. The structure of the APH(3′)-IIIa·ADP complex also reveals an analogous hydrogen bond between N-1 of ADP and the amide hydrogen of Ala-93 (10Hon W.C. McKay G.A. Thompson P.R. Sweet R.M. Yang D.S.C. Wright G.D. Berghuis A.M. Cell. 1997; 89: 887-895Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar), and thus we predicted that the isoquinolinesulfonamides could indeed bind to APH(3′) in a similar fashion (Fig. 3). The compounds H-7, H-9, HA-1004, CKI-7, and CKI-8 were competitive inhibitors of ATP binding to APH(3′)-IIIa (Table I), and additional studies determined that H-9 was a non-competitive inhibitor of the second substrate kanamycin. Thus, as predicted by the protein fold and adenine nucleotide binding strategy which is common to the aminoglycoside kinase APH(3′)-IIIa and protein kinases, isoquinolinesulfonamides bind to the active site of the drug resistance kinase in the ATP binding site, presumably through a hydrogen bond between the isoquinoline ring nitrogen and the amide hydrogen of Ala-93. Among the implications of this conclusion was the prediction that other aminoglycoside kinases, while low in overall amino acid sequence homology, would also be inhibited by the isoquinolinesulfonamides. The enzyme AAC(6′)-APH(2"") confers resistance to virtually all aminoglycoside antibiotics with the exception of streptomycin and spectinomycin.2 The 57-kDa enzyme has both aminoglycoside kinase and acetyltransferase activities which, respectively, reside in the C-terminal and N-terminal portions of the intact enzyme (12Ferretti J.J. Gilmore K.S. Courvalin P. J. Bacteriol. 1986; 167: 631-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar).2 AAC(6′)-APH(2"") shows only 16% overall primary sequence similarity to APH(3′)-IIIa. The bifunctional enzyme lacks an overlapping Lys-44 homologue (APH(3′)-IIIa numbering) which is used to position the ATP by bridging the α- and β-phosphates in APH(3′)-IIIa and protein kinases, yet the C-terminal APH(2"") portion of AAC(6′)-APH(2"") does have the sequence H372NDFSCN, similar to the catalytically important H188GDLGDSN sequence of APH(3′)-IIIa which incorporates Asp-190, the proposed catalytic base. AAC(6′)-APH(2"") was sensitive to the isoquinolinesulfonamide inhibitors tested (Table I). General inhibition behavior was identical to that found with APH(3′)-IIIa, that is competitive versus ATP and non-competitive versusaminoglycoside substrate. There were significant differences in sensitivity toward specific compounds between the kinases however. Whereas CKI-7 was a comparable inhibitor of both enzymes, APH(3′)-IIIa was more sensitive to the guanidinoethyl-containing HA-1004 and AAC(6′)-APH(2"") was more sensitive to the methylpiperazine compound H-7. The latter result was all the more surprising given the lack of inhibition by the homologue CKI-8. The AAC(6′) activity was not impaired by the inhibitors tested, thus these compounds are limited to kinase inhibition. Based on these results, we predict that the three-dimensional structure of the AAC(6′)-APH(2"") C terminus will have the general protein kinase fold despite the low sequence similarity with APH(3′)-IIIa or protein kinases. Whereas the isoquinolinesulfonamides tested are significant inhibitors of the aminoglycoside kinases in vitro, with the best compounds tested thus far yielding inhibition constants in <100 μm concentrations (corresponding to 20–30 μg/ml), they did not reverse antibiotic resistance in cultures of Enterococcus faecalis harboring aph(3′)-IIIaor aac(6′)-aph(2"") in either liquid or solid media (not shown). Nonetheless, these studies demonstrate the potential effectiveness of protein kinase inhibitors as inhibitors of antibiotic resistance, an important target for drug design (15Coleman K. Athalye M. Clancey A. Davison M. Payne D.J. Perry C.R. Chopra I. J. Antimicrob. Chemother. 1994; 33: 1091-1116Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Compounds which incorporate the isoquinoline nucleus but exploit the unique features of the aminoglycoside kinases could show selective inhibition of these enzymes and thus would find use as therapeutic agents for the reversal of antibiotic resistance."

We studied nucleotide binding as well as inhibition of fatty acid-induced proton transport in wild-type and six mutant uncoupling proteins. None of the mutations interfered with proton transport.

UCP contains an anion transport pathway that permits the charged fatty acid anion head group, to which the membrane is normally impermeable, to flip-flop in the membrane. The cycle is completed by flip-flop of the protonated fatty acid head group in the bilayer, resulting in energy-dissipating back flux of protons into the matrix (3Garlid K.D. Orosz D.E. Modriansky M.

The only known regulation of the uncoupling cycle is provided by purine nucleotides, which bind to UCP and allosterically inhibit transport (4Jezek P. Orosz D.E. Modriansky M. Garlid K.D. J. Biol.

Lysine and arginine residues have long been suspected of participation in nucleotide regulation, and Katiyar and Shrago (7Katiyar S.S. Shrago E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

However, none of the residues that interact with the phosphate groups have been identified. The introduction of a high-level expression system for UCP inSaccharomyces cerevisiae (8Murdza-Inglis D.L.

Thus, we were able to show that mutation of a single arginine residue (Arg276) abolished GDP inhibition without affecting UCP-mediated proton transport (9Murdza-Inglis D.L. Modriansky M. Patel H.V.

We have now extended this study to Arg83, Arg182, Lys268 and His214, which are positioned within the membrane-spanning helices of UCP, and Lys72, which lies outside the transmembrane domain (10Aquila H. Link T.A. Klingenberg M. EMBO J. 1985; 4: 2369-2376Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). The mutant proteins were overexpressed in yeast (8Murdza-Inglis D.L. Patel H.V. Freeman K.B. Jezek P.

Fatty acid-induced, UCP-mediated H+ transport, and its sensitivity to nucleotides, were assayed by fluorescence, and GDP binding was assayed using [3H]GDP. Each of the three arginine mutations caused complete loss of GDP inhibition of transport without affecting transport itself. This finding implies an extensive nucleotide interaction domain, because the three arginines are located on three different transmembrane segments. A surprising finding was that the Arg276 mutant, despite complete loss of sensitivity to GDP inhibition (9Murdza-Inglis D.L. Modriansky M. Patel H.V. Woldegiorgis G. Freeman K.B. Garlid K.D. J. Biol.

We propose a three-stage binding-conformational change model in which Arg276interacts with nucleotide after it is tightly bound, causing a conformational change that prevents transport of the fatty acid anion head group. Zymolyase 100T was purchased from Seikagaku America (Ijamsville, MD). [3H]GDP was purchased from NEN Life Science Products.

Methods Enzymol. 1983; 97: 329-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The final mitochondrial pellet was resuspended and stored at −20 °C in buffer consisting of 250 mm sucrose, 5 mmK-TES, pH 6.7, and 1 mm K-EGTA. UCP was extracted, purified, and reconstituted into liposomes using the protocols described in detail by Garlid et al. (13Garlid K.D. Sun X. Paucek P. Woldegiorgis G. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 260: 331-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). SPQ fluorescence is quenched by TES anion, but not by TES zwitterion, allowing measurements of changes in total acid concentration (14Orosz D.E. Garlid K.D. Anal. Biochem. 1993; 210: 7-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). SPQ (2 mm) trapped inside liposomes containing the mutant UCPs was used for assaying transport and GDP sensitivity of the transport, as before (9Murdza-Inglis D.L. Modriansky M. Patel H.V. Woldegiorgis G. Freeman K.B. Garlid K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7435-7438Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The intravesicular medium contained TES (28.8 mm), EGTA (0.6 mm), and SO4 (84.4 mm), pH 7.2, all TEA salts, and 1 mm GDP. The external medium, also at pH 7.2, contained TES (28.8 mm), and EGTA (0.6 mm) as TEA salts, and SO4 (84.4 mm) as K+ salt. Proton efflux from the liposomes was initiated by adding 30 μmlaurate followed by 0.1 μm valinomycin. Each proteoliposome preparation was calibrated to obtain the corresponding quench constant, and volume of the liposomes was estimated from the probe distribution. Protein content of liposomes was estimated by the Amido Black method (15Kaplan R.S. Pedersen P.L. Anal. Biochem. 1985; 150: 97-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). We used a modified anion-exchange method developed by Klingenberg et al. (16Klingenberg M. Herlt M. Winkler E. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 126: 498-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). A Pasteur pipette tip was sealed with packed glass wool and then filled with 30 mg of wet Dowex 1-X8, 200–400 mesh (chloride form). 75 μl of sample containing 6–9 μg of UCP was applied on top of the resin. Experimental medium contained [3H]GDP in concentrations from 1 to 15 μm and otherwise was the same composition as internal medium, described above. The sample was immediately chased with 2 × 100 μl of distilled H2O through the column with a bulb. The entire eluate was collected and subjected to scintillation counting. For control, 100 μmnonradioactive GDP was included with each concentration of the radiolabeled nucleotide. Fig. 1 contains a typical GDP concentration dependence for inhibition of wild-type UCP (solid circles) and Arg182 → Thr mutant UCP (open circles). As shown in TableI, each of the arginine mutations completely abolished GDP inhibition, whereas the lysine and histidine mutants retained full GDP sensitivity. The K i for GDP inhibition of proton flux in wild-type and native UCP under these conditions is 11 μm (9Murdza-Inglis D.L. Modriansky M. Patel H.V. Woldegiorgis G. Freeman K.B. Garlid K.D. J. Biol.

Orosz D.E. Garlid K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 19296-19302Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It transports anions in both directions, but 1 mm GDP is present in the liposomal interior, so that 50% of the wild-type UCP is always inhibited. Loss of GDP regulation should therefore free up both orientations of the protein and cause doubling of transport activity. This expectation was met in the Arg83 → Gln mutant, but not in the other two Arg mutants. Undecanesulfonate anion is transported by UCP and is a competitive inhibitor of laurate-induced proton flux (3Garlid K.D. Orosz D.E. Modriansky M. Vassanelli S. Jezek P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2615-2620Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). 300 μmundecanesulfonate inhibited proton flux in all mutants to the level of proton leak, consistent with normal behavior of the fatty acid anion transport pathway in the mutant UCPs. The concentration dependence of GDP binding yielded linear mass-action plots, from which K d and B maxvalues were obtained. These parameters are contained in TableII. In comparing the data in Tables I andII, there is agreement between GDP binding and inhibition in each case except one. Thus, the Arg83 → Gln and Arg182→ Thr mutants lost both GDP inhibition and GDP binding, whereas the Lys72 → Gln and Lys268 → Gln mutants retained both functions. The Arg276 → Leu mutant is unique in that it binds GDP normally but cannot be inhibited by GDP. Retention of normal GDP binding by the Arg276 → Leu mutant has been confirmed in isolated yeast mitochondria (18Murdza-Inglis, D. L. (1995) Structure/Function Studies of Rat Uncoupling Protein in Yeast Mitochondria (Energy Metabolism). Ph.D. thesis, McMaster University, Hamilton, CanadaGoogle Scholar). The protocol used to assay binding captures only the tightly bound state (19Huang S.-G. Klingenberg M. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 7846-7854Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar); thus, GDP is tightly bound in the Arg276 mutant.Table IIGDP binding to mutant and wild-type UCPsUncoupling proteinK dB maxμmnmol/mg proteinWild-type7.215.1Lys72 → Gln9.212.3Lys268 → Gln7.210.6Arg83 → GlnNo bindingNo bindingArg182 → ThrNo bindingNo bindingArg276 → Leu7.814.1Table contains the dissociation constants, K d, and binding capacity, B max, derived from Eadie-Scatchard plots for each of the mutants.

The dissociation constants, K d, of the mutant UCPs capable of binding GDP (Table II) are higher than published values pertaining to native rat UCP (20Rafael J. Pampel I. Wang X. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 223: 971-980Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar); however, the K dvalues are close to the observed K i for GDP inhibition of UCP-mediated transport, which is generally 11 μm (9Murdza-Inglis D.L. Modriansky M. Patel H.V. Woldegiorgis G. Freeman K.B. Garlid K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7435-7438Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This agreement may reflect our use of identical conditions for H+ flux and binding measurements. Lysine 268 is located within the third domain of the tripartite structure among residues 238–283, which have long been identified with nucleotide interactions (6Mayinger P. Klingenberg M. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 10536-10543Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), and Lys72 is located in the second domain. As shown in Tables I and II, neither residue affected GDP binding or GDP inhibition. The pH dependence of nucleoside triphosphate binding to UCP has a pK a of 7.2, which suggested involvement of a histidine residue (21Huang S.-G. Klingenberg M. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 349-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). If His214 plays this role, the His214 → Gln mutation should exhibit an increasedK i for GTP inhibition at neutral pH. In fact, this mutation had no effect on the K i for GTP inhibition at pH 7.2 or 7.6 when compared with the wild-type (three experiments, data not shown). Because of their polyanionic character, nucleotides are expected to bind to positively charged amino acid residues in UCP. Arg276 was the first such residue to be identified (9Murdza-Inglis D.L. Modriansky M. Patel H.V. Woldegiorgis G. Freeman K.B. Garlid K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7435-7438Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and we now show that Arg83 and Arg182 are also essential for normal nucleotide binding and inhibition. None of the mutations affected H+ transport, confirming that fatty acid anion transport and nucleotide inhibition are separate features of UCP and implying two distinct binding sites (4Jezek P. Orosz D.E. Modriansky M. Garlid K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26184-26190Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 7Katiyar S.S. Shrago E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 2559-2562Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The location of the three essential arginines implies an extensive interaction region involving at least three of the six transmembrane helices in UCP (Fig.2). These helices very likely form the walls of a dead-end aqueous pocket for nucleotides, which are known to enter and exit from the cytosolic side and to interact with residues located on the matrix loop between helices 5 and 6 (6Mayinger P. Klingenberg M. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 10536-10543Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Moreover, each of the three arginines is conserved in UCPH, suggesting that this protein is also regulated by nucleotides. UCPH, whose primary amino acid sequence is 56% identical with that of UCP, encodes a protein thought to be involved in prevention of obesity and diabetes (22Fleury C. Neverova M. Collins S. Raimbault S. Champigny O. Levi-Meyrueis C. Bouillaud F. Seldin M.F. Surwit R.S. Ricquier D. Warden C.H. Nat. Genet. 1997; 15: 269-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (1562) Google Scholar,23Gimeno R.E.

Klingenberg M. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 148-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) have elaborated an elegant kinetic model of the interactions of nucleotide phosphates with UCP. Access to the phosphate binding region is controlled by protonation of Glu190, presumably by releasing a salt bridge that occludes the binding site. Huang and Klingenberg (19Huang S.-G. Klingenberg M. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 7846-7854Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) proposed a two-stage mechanism in which nucleotides are first loosely bound and then the protein undergoes a slow, spontaneous conformational change to a “tight” state in which nucleotides are tightly bound and H+ transport is inhibited. Our results show, however, that the tightly bound state is not sufficient for transport inhibition. Thus, the tight binding exhibited by the Arg276 mutant is ineffective in inhibiting H+ transport. Thus, the two-stage model (19Huang S.-G. Klingenberg M. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 7846-7854Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) requires modifications, as described below and in Fig.3. The nucleotide enters the aqueous pocket in UCP, and its sugar-base moiety binds to the matrix loop connecting the fifth and sixth α-helices (5Winkler E. Klingenberg M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 203: 295-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 6Mayinger P. Klingenberg M. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 10536-10543Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). This interaction may be responsible for discrimination between purine and pyrimidine nucleotides (20Rafael J. Pampel I. Wang X. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 223: 971-980Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 26Lin C. Klingenberg M. Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 2950-2956Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar, 27Nicholls D.G. Cannon B. Grav H.J. Lindberg O. Ernster L. Dynamics of Energy-transducing Membranes. Elsevier Science Publishers B. V., Amsterdam1974: 529-537Google Scholar). The nucleotide β-phosphate binds to Arg182, and the sum of these interactions results in a loose binding conformation. The switch to a tight binding conformation is initiated by protonation of Glu190, making Arg83 available for binding to the second charge on the β-phosphate of diphosphates and the γ-phosphate of triphosphates. A histidine binds to the second charge on the γ-phosphate of triphosphates (24Klingenberg M. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 781-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The tightly bound conformation prevents trypsin cleavage of the C terminus of UCP at Lys292 (19Huang S.-G. Klingenberg M. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 7846-7854Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). This step is necessary, but not sufficient, for inhibition of transport. The nucleotide is now bound stably and positioned so that the α-phosphate can bind to Arg276. This final interaction induces a conformational change that occludes or removes the internal fatty acid binding site (3Garlid K.D. Orosz D.E. Modriansky M. Vassanelli S. Jezek P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2615-2620Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar, 28Garlid K.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1018: 151-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), causing inhibition of transport. This extension of Huang and Klingenberg's model (19Huang S.-G. Klingenberg M. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 7846-7854Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) is consistent with our finding that mutation of Arg276 to Leu did not affect the K d for binding but completely prevented nucleotide inhibition of transport."
https://openalex.org/W2093989410,"To identify the structural determinants necessary for μ opioid receptor desensitization, we serially ablated potential phosphorylation sites in the carboxyl tail of the receptor and examined their effects on [d-Ala2,N-Me-Phe4,Gly-ol5]enkephalin (DAMGO)-induced desensitization. First, we replaced Thr394with alanine (T394A) and stably expressed this mutant receptor in Chinese hamster ovary cells. The T394A receptor did not desensitize after 1 h of treatment with DAMGO, indicating that Thr394 is required for agonist-induced early desensitization. To test whether Thr394 was the only residue necessary, we investigated the importance of 7 potential phosphorylation sites between residues 363 and 383, which were all replaced by alanines with the Thr394 maintained. This mutant (AT) showed partial loss of desensitization (30%), which was attributable to the Ala mutation at Thr383, since complete desensitization was achieved by restoring Thr383 (ATT). These results suggest that Thr394 is the primary recognition site for G protein-coupled receptor kinases, but Thr383 is also required for complete agonist-induced desensitization. The specificity of Thr394 as the primary initiation site appears to be dependent on the preceding acidic amino acid stretch, because in a mutant in which glutamic acid residues at 388, 391, and 393 were replaced by glutamines (EQ), agonist-induced desensitization was completely abolished, identical to the T394A mutant.

Desensitization is defined as loss of a biological response to a ligand despite its continuous presence. This phenomenon of desensitization is observed with almost every receptor, and some of the mechanisms involved in desensitization of G protein-coupled receptors have been well characterized using the β-adrenergic receptor (βAR) 1The abbreviations used are: βAR, β-adrenergic receptor; GRK, G protein-coupled receptor kinase; α2AR, α2-adrenergic receptor; PKC, protein kinase C; DOR, δ opioid receptor; MOR, μ opioid receptor; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; DAMGO, [d-Ala2,N-Me-Phe4,Gly-ol5] enkephalin; 5-HT2R, serotonin type 2 receptor. and rhodopsin. For these receptors, the primary mechanism of desensitization appears to be receptor phosphorylation mediated by G protein-coupled receptor kinases (GRKs). Since these kinases have the unique feature of phosphorylating receptors only when they are in an active or a ligand-bound conformation, GRK-mediated phosphorylation is considered to be the main mechanism for agonist-induced desensitization. These kinases have been shown to phosphorylate a number of G protein-coupled receptors including the βAR (1Fredericks Z.L. Pitcher J.A. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol.

Endogenous opioids play an important role in a variety of physiological processes through pharmacologically distinct, three major receptor subtypes that are coupled to inhibitory G proteins (10Simon E. Med. Res. Rev. 1991; 11: 357-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Although the acute action of opioids can induce a number of beneficial effects, chronic use of opioids produces tolerance and dependence (11Koob G. Maldonado R. Stinus L. Trends. Neurosci. 1992; 15: 186-191Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar, 12Koob G. Bloom F. Science. 1992; 242: 715-719Crossref Scopus (1789) Google Scholar), which are among the major factors limiting the clinical use of opioids. The molecular mechanisms underlying these phenomena are poorly understood, and receptor desensitization has been implicated as a possible mechanism. It has been shown recently that opioid receptor desensitization is directly related to receptor phosphorylation. Protein kinase C (PKC) is involved in the functional uncoupling of the delta opioid receptor (DOR) from G protein in the striatum of guinea pigs (13Fukushima N. Ueda H. Hayashi C. Katayama T. Miyamae T. Misu Y. Neurosci. Lett. 1994; 176: 55-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). However, cellular depletion of PKC failed to alter DOR phosphorylation in HEK 293 cells (14Pei G. Kieffer B.L. Lefkowitz R.J. Freedman N.J. Mol. Pharmacol. 1995; 48: 173-177PubMed Google Scholar), indicating a role for other kinases as well. In the case of the μ opioid receptor (MOR), it was reported that activation of PKC enhanced desensitization of the receptor, leading to a decrease in the receptor-activated potassium channel current (GIRK1) inXenopus oocytes (15Chen Y. Yu L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7839-7842Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16Zhang L. Yu Y. Mackin S. Weight F.F. Uhl G.R. Wang J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11449-11454Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). However, the PKC inhibitor staurosporine showed differential effects on the PKC-mediated response and the agonist-induced response. Staurosporine blocked PKC-activated MOR phosphorylation and eliminated PKC influence on desensitization, but failed to block desensitization induced by repeated administration of agonist (16Zhang L. Yu Y. Mackin S. Weight F.F. Uhl G.R. Wang J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11449-11454Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). This result suggests participation of other kinases in agonist-mediated desensitization. Indeed, a recent study of agonist-induced phosphorylation of DOR suggests involvement of one or more GRKs in receptor desensitization (14Pei G. Kieffer B.L. Lefkowitz R.J. Freedman N.J. Mol. Pharmacol. 1995; 48: 173-177PubMed Google Scholar). It has also been shown that overexpression of a functionally impaired mutant form of GRK2 blocks κ receptor desensitization in COS-7 cells (17Raynor K. Kong H. Hines J. Kong G. Benovic J. Yasuda K. Bell G.I. Reisine T. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1994; 270: 1381-1386PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast to PKC manipulation, agonist-dependent phosphorylation of DOR in HEK 293 cells was altered by overexpression of GRK2, GRK 5, or a functionally impaired mutant form of GRK2 (14Pei G. Kieffer B.L. Lefkowitz R.J. Freedman N.J. Mol. Pharmacol. 1995; 48: 173-177PubMed Google Scholar). These data suggest that GRKs are more directly involved in receptor desensitization and function together with PKC-mediated mechanisms. In a previous study, we reported that 1-h pretreatment of MOR with the agonist DAMGO caused agonist-specific desensitization (18Pak Y. Kouvelas A. Scheideler M.A. Rasmussen J. O'Dowd B.F. George S.R. Mol. Pharmacol. 1996; 50: 1214-1222PubMed Google Scholar). The mechanisms underlying agonist-induced desensitization could include receptor phosphorylation, similar to that described for other G protein-coupled receptors. Recently, a splice variant of the MOR cDNA has been cloned from rat that differs at the 3′-end (19Zimprich A. Simon T. Hollt V. FEBS Lett. 1995; 359: 142-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). This variant (MOR1B) shares 100% amino acid sequence identity with MOR1 up to amino acid 386 but differs from residue 387 to the carboxyl tail (rMOR1, 387LENLEAETAPLP398; rMOR1B,387KIDLF391). Within that region of the carboxyl tail, one potential site for phosphorylation by GRKs is found in MOR that is absent in MOR1B. Interestingly, this shorter variant, rMOR1B, has been shown to be resistant to agonist-induced desensitization, unlike the longer form, rMOR1 (19Zimprich A. Simon T. Hollt V. FEBS Lett. 1995; 359: 142-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). The cytoplasmic tail of the MOR contains potential phosphorylation sites for GRKs which may explain the differences between the variants and has led us to map the amino acid residues important in the functional desensitization of MOR. The full-length cDNA for the rat MOR was cloned into the mammalian expression vector pRC/CMV (InVitrogen, San Diego, CA). This construct was used as a template for mutagenesis and for subsequent stable transfection of the wild type and mutant receptor cDNAs into Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell lines. Mutant MORs such as T394A, T/S363–383A (AT), T/S363–379A (ATT), E388–393Q (EQ) (Fig.1) were constructed by substituting single or multiple amino acid residues with alanine(s). In case of the mutant EQ, glutamic acids between residues 388 and 393 were substituted with glutamine. Site-directed mutagenesis was performed using a polymerase chain reaction-based technique as described previously (20Liggett S.B. Ostrowski J. Chesnut L.C. Kurose H. Raymond J.R. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 4740-4746Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, oligonucleotide primers corresponding to unique Eco47III andApaI restriction sites (located at amino acids 304–305 and at vector, respectively) were utilized in combination with two mutagenic primers. Polymerase chain reaction fragments were digested with unique restriction enzymes and subcloned into the corresponding restriction sites of pRC/CMV encoding a MOR. All mutations were verified by dideoxy sequencing. For stable expression, cell line CHO K-1 (no. CCL61; American Type Culture Collection) was grown to 60% confluency in a 100-mm dish and subsequently transfected with wild type or mutant constructs in pRC/CMV vector using a calcium phosphate transfection kit (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Stable transfectants were selected in 1 mg/ml geneticin (Life Technologies, Burlington, Ontario, Canada) and clones with the appropriate expression level were screened by radioligand binding assay. 30–90 clones expressing varying numbers of receptors were screened to select those with comparable expression levels. Cells were grown until apparent confluency and then washed twice with 12 ml of ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, harvested and centrifuged at 100 × g for 10 min. Cells were then lysed in hypotonic buffer (5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 2 mm EDTA, containing a protease inhibitor mixture (10 mg/ml leupeptin, 5 mg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor and 5 mg/ml benzamidine)) with a Polytron homogenizer (Brinkman Instruments, Westbury, NY) for two 30-s bursts at the 5.5 setting. The lysate was then centrifuged at 100 ×g for 10 min to pellet unbroken cells and nuclei. The supernatant was collected and centrifuged at 30,000 ×g for 30 min, and the resulting pellet was resuspended in buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 5 mmMgCl2, 1 mm EGTA with the protease inhibitor mixture and used immediately for radioligand binding studies. Protein content was determined according to the method of Bradford (21Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217544) Google Scholar). For saturation experiments, cell membranes (20–30 μg of protein/tube) were incubated with increasing concentrations of [3H]naloxone (specific activity, 58.5 Ci/mmol; DuPont NEN) in a total volume of 1 ml. Specific binding was determined by calculating the difference in binding of the radiolabeled ligand in the absence and presence of the μ-selective antagonist naltrexone (10 μm). Competition experiments were performed using [3H]naloxone at approximately its K dvalue and competing cold drug, DAMGO at concentrations ranging from 10−11 to 10−4m. After 2 h of incubation at room temperature, bound ligand was isolated by rapid filtration through a 48-well cell harvester (Brandel, Montreal, Quebec, Canada) onto GF/C Whatman filters. Filters were washed with 10 ml of ice-cold 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, and placed in glass vials with 5 ml of scintillation fluid (Cytoscint; ICN, Costa, Mesa, CA) and counted for tritium. All experiments were performed in duplicate, and each experiment was repeated at least three times. CHO cells expressing wild type or mutant MORs at confluent monolayer were treated with either medium alone or 1 μm DAMGO (final concentration) and incubated for 1 h at 37 °C in 5% CO2. Incubation was terminated by washing plates three times with 12 ml of ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline. Membranes were prepared as described above. Adenylyl cyclase assays were conducted essentially as described previously (22Salomon Y. Londos C. Rodbell M. Anal. Biochem. 1974; 58: 541-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (3374) Google Scholar). The assay mix contained 20 μl of membrane suspension (15–20 μg of protein), 12 μm ATP, 0.1 mm cAMP, 53 μm GTP, 2.7 mm phosphoenolpyruvate, 0.2 unit of pyruvate kinase, 1 unit of myokinase, and 0.13 μCi of [32P]ATP in a final volume of 50 μl. Enzyme activities were determined in triplicate assay tubes containing increasing concentrations (10−11 to 10−3m) of DAMGO with 10 μmforskolin. Adenylyl cyclase activity was also measured in the presence of buffer alone (basal) or forskolin alone and reactions were incubated at 27 °C for 20 min. Reactions were stopped by the addition of 1 ml of an ice-cold solution containing 0.4 mm ATP, 0.3 mm cAMP and [3H]cAMP (25,000 cpm). [32P]cAMP and [3H]cAMP were isolated by sequential column chromatography using Dowex cation exchange and aluminum oxide columns. The amount of [3H]cAMP was used to quantify individual column recovery. Data were analyzed by nonlinear least-squares regression. We previously reported that the MOR was desensitized after 1 h treatment with an agonist, DAMGO 1 μm (18Pak Y. Kouvelas A. Scheideler M.A. Rasmussen J. O'Dowd B.F. George S.R. Mol. Pharmacol. 1996; 50: 1214-1222PubMed Google Scholar). During agonist exposure, basal adenylyl cyclase activity and forskolin-stimulated adenylyl cyclase activity did not change, suggesting this desensitization was specifically agonist-induced, with no evidence of heterologous desensitization. The underlying mechanism of this agonist-induced form of desensitization is likely due to the involvement of GRKs. Since phosphorylation of receptors plays an important role in receptor desensitization, and the carboxyl tail region of MOR contains a potential phosphorylation site for GRKs (Thr394), Thr394 was substituted by alanine in the longer variant of the receptor to test the involvement of this residue in agonist-induced desensitization of MOR. Initially, stable CHO cell lines expressing wild type or mutated receptor in which the Thr394 was changed to alanine (T394A) were prepared (Fig. 1). The binding of antagonist [3H]naloxone to the wild type or T394A mutant receptor was saturable and of high affinity. The mu agonist, DAMGO detected two affinity states of the wild type and mutant receptors. With each of the receptors, 70% of the total receptor population was in a high affinity state for agonist with a dissociation constant of 3 nm, and 30% of the receptor population was in a low affinity state with a dissociation constant of 330 nm. To determine the functional coupling of the wild type and mutant receptors (T394A) to adenylyl cyclase, dose-response curves for the inhibition of forskolin-stimulated cAMP accumulation with increasing concentrations of DAMGO were tested. The IC50 values for adenylyl cyclase inhibition for both receptors in CHO cells were identical; 8.5 ± 2.6 nm (n = 7) for wild type receptors and 5.6 ± 1.2 nm (n = 4) for mutant (T394A) receptors (Fig. 2, Aand B). However, the maximum percentage inhibition of adenylyl cyclase activities was slightly different, but statistically insignificant (p > 0.05), suggesting that mutation of the Thr394 did not affect the G protein-coupling property or the functional coupling of receptors to the effector, adenylyl cyclase. In wild type receptor pretreated with 1 μm DAMGO for 1 h, agonist-dependent inhibition of forskolin-stimulated cAMP accumulation was decreased to 60% of the maximum inhibition occurring in untreated cells and IC50shifted to 200 ± 13 nm (Fig. 2 A). Strikingly, in the mutant receptor (T394A), agonist-induced desensitization of receptors was completely abolished, as indicated by the lack of rightward shift of the IC50 and a lack of reduction in the maximum inhibition of forskolin-stimulated cAMP accumulation. The IC50 for wild type receptor after 1 μm DAMGO treatment for 1 h was 200 ± 13 nm (n = 7) and IC50 for the T394A mutant was 5.3 ± 0.8 nm (n = 4) (Fig. 2, A and B). Thus, the Thr394at the carboxyl tail of the receptor is critical for agonist-induced desensitization occurring within 1 h. However, the role of 7 other potential phosphorylation sites within the carboxyl tail of MOR (2 serines and 5 threonines between residues 363 and 383) remained of interest. To test whether the Thr394was sufficient to mediate desensitization, a mutant was prepared where all 7 potential phosphorylation sites (T/S363–383A) were replaced by alanines except for the Thr394 which was left intact (AT mutant) (Fig. 1). This mutant (AT) was essentially identical to wild type receptor in expression level, agonist affinity, G protein-coupling properties, and functional coupling to adenylyl cyclase (IC50 = 8.6 ± 4.1 nm, n = 8) (Table I). The ability of this mutant receptor (AT) to inhibit forskolin-stimulated cAMP accumulation after 1 h treatment with 1 μm DAMGO (Fig. 2 C) was blunted, with maximal inhibition only 70% of that observed with wild type receptor; IC50 for wild type receptor after 1 h of agonist treatment was 200 ± 13 nm and that for AT mutant receptor was 92 ± 28 nm(n = 8) (Fig. 2, C and D). These data indicate there may be other residues in addition to the Thr394 required for full desensitization (Fig.2 D). To identify the other site(s), another mutant receptor was created in which 6 potential phosphorylation sites, 2 serines and 4 threonines, between residues 363 and 379 were substituted by alanines but the last 2 threonines at residues 383 and 394 were left intact (ATT) (Fig. 1). This mutant was also indistinguishable from wild type receptor with respect to expression level, agonist binding affinity and G protein-coupling properties (Table I). The dose-response curve for this mutant receptor (ATT) to inhibit forskolin-stimulated cAMP accumulation by DAMGO (25 ± 9 nm, n = 4) was also not different from wild type receptor (p > 0.05) (Fig. 3 A). Furthermore, the maximal inhibition induced by DAMGO by interaction with this mutant receptor (ATT) was identical with that for wild type receptors, 52 and 54%, respectively. One hour of pretreatment with 1 μmDAMGO of cells expressing mutant receptors (ATT) showed an identical degree of desensitization compared with wild type receptors; IC50 for wild type receptor after agonist treatment was 200 ± 13 nm (n = 7) and IC50 for the mutant receptor was 190 ± 12 nm (n = 4). The maximal inhibition of adenylyl cyclase activity by the mutant receptor completely overlapped with that by wild type receptors (Fig. 3 B). Taken together, results from these three mutants (T394A, AT and ATT) suggest the Thr394 is the primary recognition site by GRKs, but another threonine at residue 383 that is closest located, is also required for complete desensitization of the MOR.Table IBinding parameters for the stably transfected wild type or mutant μ opioid receptors[3H]Naloxone[2H]Naloxone/DAMGOK HK LR HR Lnm%Wild typeB max3.8 ± 0.9 pmol/mg2.9 ± 0.7326 ± 2569 ± 231 ± 2K d0.9 ± 0.2 nmT394AB max3.5 ± 0.5 pmol/mg2.7 ± 1.4329 ± 1474 ± 226 ± 2K d1.0 ± 0.3 nmT/S363–383A (AT)B max4.3 ± 0.3 pmol/mg2.2 ± 1.7370 ± 2370 ± 130 ± 1K d1.0 ± 0.1 nmT/S363–379A (ATT)B max4.0 ± 0.1 pmol/mg3.2 ± 0.2383 ± 9771 ± 229 ± 2K d1.0 ± 0.1 nmE388–393Q (EQ)B max2.0 ± 0.1 pmol/mg2.9 ± 1.8431 ± 21573 ± 227 ± 2K d2.5 ± 0.9 nmK H and K L, K iare values of the high (H) and low (L) affinity states;R H and R L, proportion of receptor in high (H) and low (L) affinity states.

Analysis of phosphorylation of a synthetic peptide based on β2AR or α2AR sequence showed that negatively charged residues are required for a peptide to serve as a substrate for GRK2 (23Onorato J.J. Palczewski K. Regan J.W. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Benovic J.L. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 5118-5125Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Support for the idea that the Thr394 serves as the primary recognition site for GRKs, compared with the other potential sites in the carboxyl tail, resulted from the stretch of acidic amino acids in front of it, a mutant receptor was created in which glutamic acid residues at 388, 391, and 393 were replaced by glutamines and Thr394 was left intact (EQ). This mutant (EQ) was expressed at low densities and naloxone binding affinity was marginally higher (Table I). However,K i values for DAMGO at high and low receptor affinity states and their proportions were comparable to those of wild type receptors, indicating no changes in G-protein coupling ability. As shown in Fig. 3 C, agonist-induced desensitization was completely abolished in the EQ mutant. Thus, the acidic amino acid residues preceding the Thr394 are absolutely necessary for Thr394 to play the critical role in desensitization, possibly by facilitating phosphorylation of Thr394 by a GRK. Our results demonstrate that the Thr394 and preceding acidic amino acids at the carboxyl tail of the MOR are the key residues required for agonist-induced receptor desensitization. Agonist-induced receptor desensitization has been proposed to be due to phosphorylation of the agonist-bound form of receptors by GRKs (reviewed in Ingleseet al. (24Inglese J. Freedman N.J. Koch W.J. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23735-23738Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and Lefkowitz (25Lefkowitz R.J. Cell. 1993; 74: 409-412Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar)). Furthermore, the recognition sites for these kinases have been identified as repeated serines and threonines at the carboxyl tail by phosphopeptide sequencing of high pressure liquid chromatography-purified peptides derived from proteolysis of phosphorylated receptors (1Fredericks Z.L.

Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 8764-8770Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Since there are usually several repeated serine/threonine residues in the carboxyl tails of G protein-coupled receptors, it is of interest to determine whether all of these residues are required to be phosphorylated to attenuate prolonged agonist-induced stimulation. Numerous studies have attempted to answer this question by using truncation mutations of the carboxyl tail of various lengths, to interfere with both receptor phosphorylation and agonist-induced desensitization (1Fredericks Z.L.

These studies demonstrated that phosphorylation of particular residues are necessary for desensitization. These results raise the question of how GRKs distinguish certain serine or threonine residues from others. Analysis of the phosphorylation of several synthetic peptides based on β2AR sequence identified two peptides that were phosphorylated by GRK2. Interestingly, the feature common to both substrate peptides was the presence of acidic amino acids, mostly glutamic acids, in close proximity to serine and threonine residues (1Fredericks Z.L.

However, peptides with glutamic acid residues on the carboxyl-terminal side of the serine or threonine were not substrates for GRK2 (23Onorato J.J. Palczewski K. Regan J.W. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Benovic J.L. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 5118-5125Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). A peptide with glutamic acid residues on both sides of the serine residue was also a poor substrate. Furthermore, a peptide that was a good GRK2 substrate became poorly phosphorylated when acidic amino acids at the amino-terminal side of the phosphorylation sites were changed to their neutral counterparts (6Eason M.G. Moreira S.P. Liggett S.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4681-4688Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 23Onorato J.J. Palczewski K. Regan J.W. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Benovic J.L. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 5118-5125Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). This strongly suggests that amino-terminal acidic amino acids relative to the phosphate acceptor group is a requirement for GRK2 recognition. In contrast to GRK2, rhodopsin kinase (GRK1) recognizes a serine or threonine residue located on the carboxyl-terminal side of basic amino acids (1Fredericks Z.L. Pitcher J.A. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13796-13803Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar, 23Onorato J.J. Palczewski K. Regan J.W. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Benovic J.L. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 5118-5125Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). This seems to indicate that even though there are several GRKs in this family of kinases, they each have different substrate specificity together with different tissue distributions (24Inglese J. Freedman N.J. Koch W.J. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23735-23738Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 25Lefkowitz R.J. Cell. 1993; 74: 409-412Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar). Sequential phosphorylation of different residues has been demonstrated in the case of rhodopsin, in which light-dependent phosphorylation occurs first at the serine in position 338, and subsequently at serine 343 and then threonine 336 (4Ohguro H.

In the case of the human C5a anaphylatoxin receptor, phosphoamino acid analysis of C5a-dependent phosphorylation showed the maximal stoichiometry to be 6 moles of phosphate/mole of receptor. However, mutation of 2 particular serines at positions 332 and 338 completely abolished agonist-dependent phosphorylation, further suggesting multiple phosphorylations occurring in a sequential manner (9Giannini E. Brouchon L. Boulay F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19166-19172Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). However, in the case of α2AR, there are 4 consecutive serines in the third intracellular loop and substitution of each serine decreased overall phosphorylation by 25% when compared with that of wild type α2AR (6Eason M.G. Moreira S.P. Liggett S.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4681-4688Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Since both C5a anaphylatoxin receptor and α2AR are substrates for the same kinase, GRK2, it is unlikely that these two different patterns of phosphorylation are due to different substrate and kinase interactions. It remains to be determined if the nonsequential nature of α2AR phosphorylation reflected the close proximity of each serine residue or its third loop location. However, in our study, substitution of the Thr394 completely abolished agonist-induced desensitization, whereas for achieving the full agonist-induced desensitization, both Thr383 and Thr394 appear necessary in the carboxyl terminus. This would be best explained by a sequential phosphorylation model, in which Thr383 can be phosphorylated only after Thr394is already phosphorylated. Since it has been reported that GRK2 is the most predominant of the GRK isoforms expressed in CHO cells, as evidenced by Western blotting experiments with antibodies specific for GRK2 and GRK3 (35Kurose H. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10093-10099Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we postulate that these two threonine residues are the likely targets for GRK2 action, leading to receptor phosphorylation and desensitization. It remains, however, to be shown that phosphorylation does occur at these threonine residues specifically. Since there are many repeated serines and threonines in the carboxyl tail of the MOR, it is important to know whether all of these residues actually need to be phosphorylated for receptor desensitization. Furthermore, another unknown factor is whether the sites identified in the cell culture study represent the sites of phosphorylation in endogenous tissues under physiological conditions. Although the stoichiometry of maximum receptor phosphorylation using biochemical experiments has been calculated for many receptors, the actual stoichiometry in vivo in living tissues has not been well studied yet. For instance, cell culture studies have suggested that multiphosphorylation of rhodopsin occurs at as many as 9 residues, but an in vivo study using retinas collected from mice demonstrated that only a single phosphate group was incorporated into the mouse rhodopsin molecule in a light-dependent manner, at serine 338 after light flashes and at serine 334 after continuous illumination (4Ohguro H. Van Hooser J.P. Milam A.H. Palczewski K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14259-14262Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar, 36Chen J. Makino C.L. Peachey N.S. Baylor D.A. Simon M.I. Science. 1995; 267: 374-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar), both of which were found to be major sites forin vitro phosphorylation. Our data also shows that among the 8 serines or threonines in the carboxyl tail that we have examined, only two threonine residues at 383 and 394 are necessary for agonist-induced desensitization. Another interesting feature of GRK-mediated receptor phosphorylation is that the time course of this event seems to be regulated by the primary recognition residue, usually serine in the carboxyl tail, because the most prominent and rapid desensitization seems to occur in parallel with phosphorylation of the primary recognition site. In the case of the serotonin type 2 receptor (5-HT2R) and the thrombin receptor, each has a similar carboxyl tail structure but a very different time course of functional desensitization, even though they interact with the same effector, phospholipase C. Thrombin receptor desensitization occurs rapidly, but 5-HT2R desensitization is slower. However, a chimeric receptor having the core of the 5-HT2R with the carboxyl-tail of thrombin receptor undergoes rapid desensitization, suggesting that the structure of the carboxyl-tail may determine the time course of desensitization (8Vouret-Craviari V. Auberger P. Pouyssegur J. Van ObberghenSchilling E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4813-4821Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Given that GRKs have a preference for serine residues over threonine (23Onorato J.J. Palczewski K. Regan J.W. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Benovic J.L. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 5118-5125Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar), and since the thrombin receptor has only serine residues clustered in an acidic environment in the carboxyl tail, it might be interesting to speculate that the slower time course of desensitization of the 5-HT2R might be due to its primary phosphorylation site being threonine. This speculation is very tempting to apply to our data, since the time course of desensitization of the MOR is slower than GRK-mediated desensitization of other receptors, and the primary recognition site for MOR desensitization as we have shown, appears to rely on two threonine residues in the carboxyl tail. In summary, we have established that both Thr394 and a cluster of glutamic acids at residues 388, 391, and 393 preceding Thr394 in the carboxyl-tail of the MOR are absolute requirements for agonist-induced MOR desensitization. However, Thr383, the closest threonine to Thr394, plays an additional role in this desensitization if Thr394 is left unchanged. Since Thr394 with a stretch of acidic amino acid residues at its amino terminus side serves as an ideal sequence for GRK2 action, we propose the following model. Thr394 is the primary site that is targeted upon agonist binding to the MOR, with recognition of this putative phosphorylation site being dependent on the acidic residues preceding it. This phosphorylation event by itself can lead to submaximal (70%) receptor desensitization. Subsequent sequential phosphorylation of Thr383, after Thr394 phosphorylation, would effect the complete desensitization of the MOR in response to agonist."

The predominant intracellular accumulation product was a C-terminal fragment of APP that co-migrated with the protein product of an HSV recombinant expressing the C-terminal 100 amino acids (C100) of APP, which is known to cause neurodegeneration. Fractionation studies revealed that the C-terminal fragment generated by expression of the Alzheimer mutations, like C100, partitioned into membrane fractions and was particularly enriched in synaptosomes. The processing abnormality caused by expression of the Alzheimer mutations occurs predominantly in neurons. Expression of these mutations or of C100 alone in neurons caused increased secretion of Aβ relative to that of neurons infected with wild type APP recombinant vectors. These data show that expression of APP mutations that cause familial Alzheimer's disease increases the intracellular accumulation of potentially amyloidogenic and neurotoxic C-terminal fragments of APP in neurons.

Some familial forms of Alzheimer's disease (FAD) 1The abbreviations used are: FAD, familial Alzheimer's disease; AD, Alzheimer's disease; APP, β-amyloid precursor protein; Aβ, β-amyloid; HSV, herpes simplex virus; HCHWA, hereditary cerebral hemorrhage with amyloidosis; Tricine,N-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycine. are caused by autosomal dominant mutations (1Van Broeckhoven C.L. Eur. Neurol. 1995; 35: 8-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) in the gene for the β-amyloid precursor protein (APP). Analyses of β-amyloid (Aβ) in genetically engineered cell lines expressing these mutants have shown that expression of the “Swedish” mutant of APP causes increased overall secretion of Aβ (2Citron M. Oltersdorf T. Haass C. McConlogue L. Yung A.Y. Seubert P. Vigo-Pelfrey C. Lieberburg I. Selkoe D.J. Nature. 1992; 360: 672-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (1534) Google Scholar, 3Cai X.D. Golde R.E. Younkin S.G. Science. 1993; 259: 514-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (835) Google Scholar), whereas expression of the 717 mutations causes increased secretion of a “long” (42–43-amino acid) form of Aβ relative to the shorter 40-amino acid form (4Suzuki N. Cheung T.T. Cai X.-D. Odaka A. Otvos Jr., L. Eckman C. Golde T.E. Younkin S.G. Science. 1994; 264: 1336-1340Crossref PubMed Scopus (1354) Google Scholar). Consequently, a leading hypothesis for the etiology of AD is that increased Aβ42(43) is a shared molecular correlate of FAD mutations and that it represents a gain of deleterious function that can cause FAD (5Hardy J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 2095-2097Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). This gain-of-function hypothesis is attractive; however, molecular mechanisms other than those mediated by extracellular Aβ could also constitute a deleterious gain of function that leads to AD neurodegeneration. In particular, intracellular events mediated by APP metabolites may cause neuronal death. For example, amyloidogenic C-terminal fragments of APP are neurotoxic in vitro and cause AD-like neuropathology in vivo (6Yankner B.A. Dawes L.R. Fisher S. Villa-Komaroff L. Oster-Granite M.L. Neve R.L. Science. 1989; 245: 417-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (817) Google Scholar, 7Oster-Granite M.L. McPhie D.L. Greenan J. Neve R.L. J.

Moreover, whereas previous studies showing increased secretion of Aβ42(43) by cells expressing FAD APP mutants in vitro have utilized cell lines, the metabolism of APP in neurons is of particular relevance to this neurodegenerative disorder. To identify metabolic fragments of APP that are generated by neurons in FAD, we used a herpes simplex virus (HSV) vector to express five different FAD mutants of APP in primary neurons in culture. All of the mutants caused abnormal intracellular increases in the level of a C-terminal APP fragment encompassing the Aβ sequence and cytoplasmic domain, as well as increased secretion of Aβ. Trans-polymerase chain reaction mutagenesis (9Neve R.L. Neve K.A. Sealfon S.C. Receptor Molecular Biology, Methods in Neurosciences. Academic Press, San Diego1995: 163-174Google Scholar) was used to make the Swedish mutation, APPK595N,M596L (numbering based on the APP-695 spliced form) at the N-terminal end of Aβ, the three mutations APPV642(F/G/I) C-terminal to Aβ, and the mutation APPA617G, which can cause AD or “Dutch” hereditary cerebral hemorrhage with amyloidosis (HCHWA) in both the APP-695 and APP-751 cDNAs. We prepared replication-defective HSV vectors expressing human APP-695 and -751, the FAD mutants of each, and APP-C100 (6Yankner B.A. Dawes L.R. Fisher S. Villa-Komaroff L. Oster-Granite M.L. Neve R.L. Science. 1989; 245: 417-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (817) Google Scholar) in pHSVPrpUC as described (10Neve R.L. Howe J.R. Hong S. Kalb R.G. Neuroscience. 1997; 79: 435-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). The titer of the helper virus component of each stock was 1–1.2 × 106 plaque forming units/ml on 2–2 cells. The titer of the recombinant virus component of each stock, as assayed by expression of the exogenous gene in PC12 cells, was consistently 3 × 107 infectious units/ml; the HSVlac negative control was 9 × 107 infectious units/ml. Primary cortical cultures from E21 rat embryos were plated at a density of 5 × 106 viable cells per 10-cm poly-d-lysine-coated dish in neurobasal medium supplemented with B27 (Life Technologies, Inc.), 10% fetal bovine serum, and 5% horse serum. 6–8 days after plating, each dish was infected with 20 μl of the indicated virus stock (multiplicity of infection, approximately 1) as described (10Neve R.L. Howe J.R. Hong S. Kalb R.G. Neuroscience. 1997; 79: 435-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). The complete set of infections was performed six times and utilized recombinant viruses from at least two independently generated stocks. Primary astrocyte cultures were generated as described (11Levison S.W. McCarthy K.D. Banker G. Goslin K. Culturing Nerve Cells. MIT Press, Cambridge1991: 310-336Google Scholar). 16 h after infection of the cultures, media were removed and frozen in a dry ice-ethanol bath. The infected cells were homogenized in buffer A (20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 1 mm MgCl2, 125 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100) + 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 50 mm NaF, 100 μm Na3VO4, boiled, sonicated, and centrifuged at 13,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. 5 μg of each sample were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (10–20% Tris-glycine gradient gels (Bio-Rad) or 10–20% Tris-Tricine gradient gels (Integrated Separation Systems)) and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride (Millipore) membranes for immunoblot analysis (Western Star immunodetection system, Tropix) with antibody C8 (gift of D. Selkoe). The affinity-purified monoclonal antibody 6E10 (Senetek, Maryland Heights, MO) directed against residues 5–10 of the Aβ sequence was used in some experiments. Blots were also probed with a monoclonal antibody to tubulin (TUB2.1, Sigma) to confirm equal loading of protein in the lanes. Three sets of infections were each analyzed in triplicate for quantification. Controls included mock infections and infections with HSVlac. Relative optical densities with background subtraction were quantified on a film-based imaging system (MCID, Imaging Research, St. Catherine's, ON, Canada). 16 h post-infection, rat cortical cultures (7 days in vitro) were harvested for biochemical fractionation (12Gray E. Whittaker V. J. Anat. 1962; 96: 79-87PubMed Google Scholar). 5 μg each of the fractions were blotted with the C8 antibody. Metabolic labeling followed by immunoprecipitation was performed as described (13Haass C. Hung A.Y. Selkoe D.J. J. Neurosci. 1991; 11: 3783-3793Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) to assay for C-terminal APP metabolites in the conditioned media. Aβ(1–40) and Aβ(1–42) were quantified in samples of conditioned media as described (4Suzuki N. Cheung T.T. Cai X.-D. Odaka A. Otvos Jr., L. Eckman C. Golde T.E. Younkin S.G. Science. 1994; 264: 1336-1340Crossref PubMed Scopus (1354) Google Scholar), except that in the experiment (see Table II) evaluating Aβ in the media of cells infected with HSV/C100 and HSV/lac, and mock-infected, the BNT77 capture antibody, directed against Aβ residues 11–28, was used instead of the BAN50 capture antibody directed against the N terminus of Aβ. The BAN50 capture system detected Aβ in the HSV/C100-infected cultures but not in the mock or HSV/lac-infected cultures. Aβ secreted in these latter cultures may be N-terminally truncated and/or modified.Table IIAβ40Aβ42Ratio 42/40Mock750.8 ± 68.699.3 ± 9.013.2 ± 0.1Lac-Z492.4 ± 22.755.7 ± 4.311.3 ± 0.4C1002402.0 ± 80.7353.9 ± 12.114.7 ± 0.3Values (mean ± S.E. of triplicate samples) are pmconcentrations. Open table in a new tab Values (mean ± S.E. of triplicate samples) are pmconcentrations. Primary rat cortical cultures were infected with HSV recombinant vectors expressing cDNAs for wild type APP-695/751, for five different FAD mutations of each spliced form, and for APP-C100. 16 h later (prior to the appearance of C100-induced neurotoxicity), the infected cells were harvested and immunoblot analysis was performed. Representative samples are shown in Fig. 1. Amounts of APP expressed from the HSV vectors in the neurons are severalfold greater than endogenous levels, as determined by comparison with mock-transfected or HSVlac-transfected neurons (ranging from a 3.2-fold average increase over endogenous levels for V642G-751 to a 17-fold average increase for wild type APP-695; data not shown). The higher levels of APP observed in neurons infected with HSV vectors expressing wild type APP transgenes compared with those seen in neurons infected with HSV/FAD-APP vectors are consistent with results obtained by Caiet al. (7Oster-Granite M.L. McPhie D.L. Greenan J. Neve R.L. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 6732-6741Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) with APP-transfected cell lines. A 12-kDa fragment that co-migrates with a fragment representing the C-terminal 100 amino acids of APP (APP-C100, expressed from a HSV/C100 vector) is detected at low levels in cell lysates from neurons infected with APP-695 or -751. Below it (P10) is the fragment presumably generated by the constitutive α-secretase cleavage of APP (14Anderson J.P. Esch F.S. Keim P.S. Sambamurti K. Lieberburg I. Robakis N.K. Neurosci. Lett. 1991; 128: 126-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). In the figure shown, the amount of the fragment co-migrating with APP-C100 appears to be increased severalfold in specific cell lysates from neurons infected with HSV/APP FAD mutant recombinants relative to those infected with wild type recombinants. The data were quantified (Fig. 2) by measuring the intensities of the bands of the fragments co-migrating with APP-C100 and normalizing each value to the intensity of the APP band in the same sample. The Swedish mutation caused a 7-fold increased accumulation of the C100-sized fragment over wild type in APP-695 and an 8-fold increase in APP-751. Each of the other mutations, except for the V642I mutation in APP-695, caused increased levels of the C100-sized fragment in neurons, with the increases achieving significance for V642I in APP-751, V642F in APP-695, V642G in APP-695, and A617G (HCHWA) in APP-751 and near significance for the remaining mutations. The FAD mutations that we analyzed had differential effects on the processing of APP-695 compared with APP-751. In particular, the V642I mutation, when expressed in APP-751, caused a very large increase in the accumulation of a C100-sized fragment in neurons, whereas when it was expressed in APP-695 it caused no detectable alteration in the levels of this same C-terminal fragment. Levels of the presumed P10 fragment were increased as well, but the increase was not as pronounced as that of the C100-sized fragment. To determine whether the accumulated C-terminal fragment was a product of β- or α-secretase cleavage of APP, we probed blots of the lysates with the antibody 6E10 (Fig. 3). This antibody immunodetected a band that co-migrated with the APP-C100 fragment in all lysates from neurons infected with FAD APP HSV vectors (V642G and HCHWA samples not shown) and that was not detectable in mock- or HSV/lac-infected cultures while only faintly detected in neurons infected with wild type APP HSV vectors. The lower P10 band seen in Fig. 1 with the C8 antibody was not immunopositive with 6E10. These data demonstrate that the band co-migrating with APP-C100 is not derived from α-secretase cleavage of APP, which occurs between amino acids 16 and 17 of the Aβ sequence and therefore is likely to be a product of β-secretase cleavage of APP, which occurs at the beginning of the Aβ sequence. On the basis of its mobility on SDS-polyacrylamide gels, the C-terminal fragment of APP that accumulates in neurons infected with HSV vectors expressing FAD mutants of APP appears to be very similar to, if not identical to, APP-C100. To determine whether the C100-sized fragment is present in the same cellular compartments that APP-C100 is, we harvested HSV/FAD-APP-infected cultures for biochemical fractionation (Fig. 4). The C100-sized fragments that accumulated in cultures infected with HSV/V642I-751, HSV/SWE-751, and HSV/C100 were all enriched in membrane fractions, particularly in P2–0.8 m (synaptosomes), P2–1.2 m (lysosomes and mitochondria), and P3 (microsomes). The primary cultures used contain glial as well as neuronal cells. To test whether the abnormal processing of APP observed in primary neuronal cultures infected with HSV/FAD-APP vectors occurs in neurons or the glia, we generated primary astrocyte cultures, which were infected with the HSV vectors after 7 days in vitro. Although infection of these cells by the HSV vectors was efficient and resulted in the production of APP and P10, C100-sized fragments were not detectable in astrocyte cultures infected with the HSV/FAD-APP vectors (data not shown). These data suggest that the abnormal accumulation of C100-sized fragments in neuronal cultures infected with HSV/FAD-APP vectors is due to abnormal processing that occurs in neurons rather than in astrocytes. Metabolic labeling followed by immunoprecipitation was performed as described (21Dyrks T. Weidemann A. Multhaup G. Salbaum J.M. Lemaire H.-G. Kang J. Müller-Hill B. Masters C.L. Beyreuther K.

Neither P10 nor C100-sized fragments were detected in any of the experimental or control cultures (data not shown), suggesting that these polypeptides are not secreted or are secreted in amounts below the level of detection. These data are consistent with those obtained by Dyrks et al. (15Dyrks T. Dyrks E. Monning U. Urmoneit B. Turner J. Beyreuther K. FEBS Lett. 1993; 335: 89-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) and Citron et al. (16Citron M. Diehl T.S. Capell A. Haass C. Teplow D.B. Selkoe D.J. Neuron. 1996; 17: 171-179Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). It has been reported that cell cultures transfected with vectors expressing FAD mutants of APP display increased secretion of Aβ(1–42) (2Citron M. Oltersdorf T. Haass C. McConlogue L. Yung A.Y.

Science. 1994; 264: 1336-1340Crossref PubMed Scopus (1354) Google Scholar). To ascertain whether the same holds true for neurons infected with FAD APP vectors, levels of Aβ(1–40) and Aβ(1–42) were quantified in conditioned media from cells infected with HSV/FAD-APP, HSV/C100, and control HSV vectors. As shown in Table I, the Swedish mutation in both APP-695 and APP-751 caused an approximately 20-fold increase in the secretion of Aβ relative to that caused by vectors expressing wild type APP, whereas the V642I mutation in APP-751 increased secretion of Aβ over 30-fold. The ratio of secreted Aβ(1–42) to Aβ(1–40) was not altered significantly in neurons infected with HSV/FAD-APP vectors except in the case of the Swedish mutation in APP-695.Table IAβ1–40Aβ1–42Ratio 42/40APP-695wt2271.7 ± 195.5200.5 ± 14.68.8 ± 0.2APP-695swe42407.9 ± 1268.24671.2 ± 116.011.0 ± 0.2APP-751V642I71687.0 ± 782.35820.5 ± 129.98.1 ± 0.1APP-751wt4378.4 ± 271.3395.6 ± 30.19.0 ± 0.3APP-751swe49796.8 ± 2374.84956.0 ± 59.310.0 ± 0.4Values (mean ± S.E. of triplicate samples) are nmconcentrations normalized to the optical density of intracellular APP, as measured by immunoblot analysis, for each sample. Open table in a new tab Values (mean ± S.E. of triplicate samples) are nmconcentrations normalized to the optical density of intracellular APP, as measured by immunoblot analysis, for each sample. In a separate experiment (Table II), Aβ released from neurons infected with HSV/C100 was compared with that from mock- or HSV/lac-infected neurons. HSV/lac-infected neurons showed slightly less secretion of Aβ than did mock-infected neurons. However, infection of neurons with HSV/C100 caused an approximately 3-fold increase in secretion of Aβ relative to HSV/lac-infected controls. In addition, the ratio of Aβ(1–42) to Aβ(1–40) was significantly increased in HSV/C100-infected cultures compared with HSV/lac-infected cultures. We have shown that expression of FAD APP mutants in primary rat neurons in vitro causes abnormal intracellular accumulation of a C-terminal fragment of APP that co-migrates and co-fractionates with APP-C100. This C-terminal fragment probably is generated by β-secretase cleavage of APP, and the data suggest that the abnormal processing occurs predominantly in neurons rather than in glial cells. Neurons expressing these APP mutants or APP-C100 show increased secretion of both Aβ(1–40) and Aβ(1–42). Although a previous report has noted increased overall secretion of Aβ by hippocampal neurons expressing the Swedish and Dutch mutants of APP-695 via the Semliki Forest Virus (17De Strooper B. Simons M. Multhaup G. Van Leuven F. Beyreuther K. Dotti C.G. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4932-4938Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar), the present paper is, to our knowledge, the first to analyze the effect of all five published FAD mutations of APP in both APP-695 and APP-751 on the generation of C-terminal metabolites of APP by neurons. Expression of V642 mutations in non-neuronal mammalian cells has not been observed to cause changes in APP-C100 levels (3Cai X.D. Golde R.E. Younkin S.G. Science. 1993; 259: 514-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (835) Google Scholar, 18Felsenstein K.M. Lewis-Higgins L. Neurosci. Lett. 1993; 152: 185-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), suggesting that the presumed increased β-secretase processing of these mutations observed in the present study occurs primarily or exclusively in neurons. In contrast to data from an earlier study showing that neuroblastoma cells expressing the V642I mutation secrete an altered ratio of Aβ(1–42) to Aβ(1–42) but show no change in the absolute level of Aβ (4Suzuki N. Cheung T.T. Cai X.-D. Odaka A. Otvos Jr., L. Eckman C. Golde T.E. Younkin S.G. Science. 1994; 264: 1336-1340Crossref PubMed Scopus (1354) Google Scholar), our preliminary data suggest that the same mutation expressed in neurons causes an overall increase in Aβ secretion but no change in the ratio of Aβ(1–42)/Aβ(1–40). The results may reflect a difference in APP processing in primary neurons relative to cell lines. The electrophoretic mobility of the intracellular C-terminal fragment of APP that accumulates abnormally, together with its co-localization with APP-C100 in specific membrane fractions, suggest that it is very similar, if not identical, to APP-C100. We have proposed that APP-C100 is involved in the etiology of Alzheimer's disease (7Oster-Granite M.L. McPhie D.L. Greenan J. Neve R.L. J.

The Swedish mutation at the N terminus of Aβ is also at the N terminus of APP-C100, and the mutations at the C terminus of Aβ may enhance the production of APP-C100,e.g. by altering the requirements for “γ-secretase” cleavage of APP. These observations led us to test the hypothesis, in the present work, that FAD mutations of APP may have additional effects on APP metabolism in neurons besides increasing Aβ release. Indeed, these mutations cause build-up of a C100-like APP fragment in the neurons. It is interesting that the FAD mutations that we analyzed had differential effects on the processing of APP-695 compared with APP-751. Overexpression of APP-C100 alone in the neurons causes increased secretion of Aβ(1–42), suggesting that the increased secretion of Aβ(1–42) by neurons expressing FAD mutations of APP may be a consequence of accumulation of APP-C100 in the cells. This raises the question of whether APP-C100 is increased in neurons of individuals with the Swedish mutation, as has been shown for Aβ(1–42) (3Cai X.D. Golde R.E. Younkin S.G. Science. 1993; 259: 514-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (835) Google Scholar) and whether these fragments are elevated in the neurons of patients with other FAD mutations of APP. Increased release of Aβ(1–42) from fibroblasts of AD patients with presenilin mutations, as well as increased levels of Aβ(1–42) in their plasma, have been demonstrated (23Scheuner C. Eckman C. Jensen M. Song X. Citron M. Suzuki N. Bird T.D. Hardy J. Hutton M. Kukull W. Larson E. Levy-Lahad E. Viitanen M. Peskind E. Poorkaj P. Schellenberg G. Tanzi R. Wasco W. Lannfelt L. Selkoe D. Younkin S. Nat. Med. 1996; 2: 864-870Crossref PubMed Scopus (2269) Google Scholar). It will be instructive to determine whether APP-C100 levels in neurons are increased not only by FAD mutations of APP but also by FAD mutations of the presenilins.

Fibronectin (Fn) 1The abbreviations used are: Fn, fibronectin; mAb, monoclonal antibody; KLH, keyhole limpet hemocyanin.1The abbreviations used are: Fn, fibronectin; mAb, monoclonal antibody; KLH, keyhole limpet hemocyanin. is an extracellular matrix and plasma protein composed of structural domains that contain binding sites for other macromolecules (fibrin, heparin/proteoglycans, collagen), as well as for cells (reviewed in Hynes (1Hynes R.O. Fibronectins. Springer-Verlag, New York1990Crossref Google Scholar)). The NH2-terminal heparin binding domain or Hep I (see Fig. 1) also interacts with cell surfaces by binding to uncharacterized molecules and is mainly involved in formation of Fn matrices (1Hynes R.O.

The Hep II domain displays the highest avidity for heparin and contains specific sequences which bind proteoglycans and/or the α4β1 integrin at the cell surface and induce cell adhesion (3Iida J.

Two other sequences, CS-1 and CS-5, located within the IIICS segment (outside the Hep II domain) are also ligands for α4β1 (8Humphries M.J. Komoriya A. Akiyama S.K. Olden K. Yamada K.M. J. Biol.

These previous studies have established that α4β1 may bind several sequences in the COOH-terminal region of Fn and that these interactions are particularly important in lymphoid cells, where α4β1 is highly expressed. The central Hep III domain is less well studied because it binds heparin only at low salt concentration, and the physiological significance of this interaction is unclear. Using DNA affinity chromatography, we and others previously isolated proteolytic fragments from this region of Fn, which displayed low affinity binding to heparin. These include a 14-kDa fragment corresponding to FN-III1 repeat (13Calaycay J. Pande H. Lee T. Borsi L. Siri A. Shively J.E. Zardi L. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 12136-12141Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and two fragments of 18–20 kDa (FN-III4-1/25 repeats) (14Pande H. Calaycay J. Hawke D. Ben-Avram C.M. Shively J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 2301-2306Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and 30 kDa (FN-III4–6 repeats) (15Skorstengaard K. Jensen M.S. Petersen T.E. Magnusson S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1986; 154: 15-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) from human and bovine plasma Fn, respectively. We also previously reported that an 80-kDa tryptic fragment (FN-III4-1/2FN-III11) binds heparin with low avidity (16Garcia-Pardo A. Ferreira O.C. Valinsky J. Bianco C. Exp. Cell Res. 1989; 181: 420-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). It is not known whether this heparin binding domain also interacts with cells. The present study was undertaken to further characterize the properties of the Hep III domain of Fn. To this effect, we have prepared recombinant fragments encompassing type III homology repeats from this region and have studied their cell binding activities. We show that a fragment containing the FN-III5 repeat mediates adhesion of T and B lymphoid cells efficiently. Furthermore, we have identified a novel 6-amino acid-sequence as the active site in FN-III5, and we show that activated α4β1 and α4β7 integrins are receptors for this sequence and the FN-III5 fragment. These results therefore establish a novel function for the Hep III Fn domain. To prepare recombinant Fn fragments expanding type III repeats1/22–11 (without the ED-B repeat) (see Fig.1 B), we made a construct using Fn cDNA from clones pFH154 (17Kornblihtt A.R. Umezawa K. Vibe-Pedersen K. Baralle F.E. EMBO J. 1985; 4: 1755-1759Crossref PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar) and λF10. The λF10 clone was obtained by screening a human melanoma cDNA library in λgt11 (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA) using IST-3 mAb (see below). The cDNA fragments, which contained nucleotides 2229–4787 (17Kornblihtt A.R. Umezawa K. Vibe-Pedersen K. Baralle F.E. EMBO J. 1985; 4: 1755-1759Crossref PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar), were inserted into pQE-3/5 vectors using the QIAexpress kit (Qiagen, Chatsworth, CA). Recombinant FN-III1/22–11 was isolated by immunoaffinity chromatography using mAb 3E3 (18Pierschbacher M.D. Hayman E.G. Ruoslahti E. Cell. 1981; 26: 259-267Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar) conjugated to Sepharose 4B (Pharmacia Biotech, Uppsala, Sweden). Further purification of this fragment was achieved by gel filtration chromatography on AcA44 (Pharmacia) columns equilibrated in 10 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.1, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5% SDS. Recombinant fragments containing type III homology repeats 5 (FN-III5), and 6 (FN-III6) were produced by polymerase chain reaction amplification using UlTma DNA-polymerase (Perkin-Elmer), cDNA from FN-III1/22–11 clones, and appropriate primers. Polymerase chain reaction products were cloned into pQE-12 or pQE-3/5 vector using the QIAexpress kit and expressed in Escherichia coli. All cloned cDNAs were sequenced using a Sequenase 2.0 DNA sequencing kit (U. S. Biochemical Corp.). FN-III5 fragment, without the 6 × His tag, was purified by immunoaffinity chromatography using IST-4 mAb (see below). FN-III6 fragment contains the 6 × His tag and was purified using nickel-chelating nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose chromatography. Purity of recombinant fragments was confirmed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis gradient gels (4–18%, see Fig.1). The proteolytic native fragments 80 kDa, containing the RGD sequence, and 38 kDa, containing the Hep II domain and the CS-1 site, have been previously described (16Garcia-Pardo A. Ferreira O.C. Valinsky J. Bianco C. Exp. Cell Res. 1989; 181: 420-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 19Garcia-Pardo A. Pearlstein E. Frangione B. Biochem. J. 1987; 241: 923-928Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The synthetic peptides KLDAPT (H2), and KDLAPT (scramble H2 or H2.sc) were synthesized on an automated multiple peptide synthesizer (AMS 422, ABIMED, Langenfeld, Germany) using standard solid phase procedures. Peptides were purified by reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography. Peptide CDELPQLVTLPHPNLHGPEILDVPST (CS1) was purchased from AMS biotecnologı́a (Madrid, Spain). Peptides were covalently conjugated to keyhole limpet hemocyanin (KLH, Calbiochem-Novabiochem Int., La Jolla, CA) with glutaraldehyde as described previously (7Domı́nguez-Jiménez C.

Recombinant VCAM-1 was kindly provided by Dr. Roy Lobb (Biogen Inc., Cambridge, MA). Amino acid sequence comparisons among Fn cell binding sites were done using software from The Phylip package (Phylip manual version 3.0; J.

The following mAbs were obtained as gifts: activating anti-β1 mAb T2/16 and function blocking anti-α4 HP2/1, both used as culture supernatant (Dr. Francisco Sánchez-Madrid, Hospital de la Princesa, Madrid, Spain); anti-αVβ3 mAb LM609, ascitic fluid (Dr. David Cheresh, Scripps Research Institute, La Jolla, CA); and anti-α4β7 mAb Act-1, purified Ab (Dr. Douglas J. Ringler, Leukosite, Cambridge, MA). Anti-α5 mAb P1D6 (ascitic fluid) was purchased from Calbiochem. The human B cell line Ramos was obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Rockville, MD); RPMI 8866 (B lymphoblastic) and K562 (erythrocytic) cells were obtained from Dr. F. Sánchez-Madrid. T cell lines Jurkat and JM were obtained from Dr. Margarita López-Trascasa (Hospital La Paz, Madrid) and Dr. Carmelo Bernabeu (Centro de Investigaciones Biológicas), respectively. Cells were maintained in RPMI 1640, 10% fetal bovine serum (ICN Pharmaceuticals, Costa Mesa, CA), and 24 μg/ml gentamycin (Life Technologies, Inc., Middlesex, UK). 5 × 105 cells were incubated for 30 min at 4 °C with 100 μl of culture supernatants (1:2 dilution) or ascitis (1:100 dilution) containing the appropriate mAb. Cells were washed twice with cold phosphate-buffered saline, 1% bovine serum albumin and resuspended in 100 μl of a 1:30 dilution of fluorescein-conjugated F(ab′)2 fragments of rabbit antibodies to mouse IgG (Dakopatts, Glostrop, Denmark). After 30 min at 4 °C, cells were washed twice, resuspended in 200 μl of phosphate-buffered saline, and analyzed by flow cytometry on an EPICS-CS (Coulter Cientı́fica, Móstoles, Spain). These assays were performed as described elsewhere (7Domı́nguez-Jiménez C. Sánchez-Aparicio P. Albar J.P. Garcia-Pardo A. Cell Adhes. Commun. 1996; 4: 251-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 21Sánchez-Aparicio P. Domı́nguez-Jiménez C. Garcia-Pardo A. J.

Assays were carried out for 1–3 h at 37 °C, and attached cells were stained with toluidine blue and quantitated by reading the absorbance at 620 nm on a Multiskan Bichromatic plate reader (Labsystems, Helsinki, Finland) and visually on an inverted microscope (Nikon Diaphot, Japan) (21Sánchez-Aparicio P. Domı́nguez-Jiménez C. Garcia-Pardo A. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 271-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Integrin activation with TS2/16 mAb or Mn2+ was performed by incubating the cells with 1:10 dilution of hybridoma supernatant or 10 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl, 1% bovine serum albumin, 1 mmMn2+, pH 7.2, for 15 min at 37 °C prior to the attachment assay. For inhibition experiments, cells were incubated in a total volume of 400 μl, with appropriate supernatant (1:5 dilution), ascitic fluid (1:100 dilution), or peptides (various concentrations) for 30 min at room temperature. The cell suspension was then diluted to 5 × 105 cells/ml, and 100 μl were added to each substrate-coated well. Inhibition of binding of alkaline phosphatase-coupled VCAM-Ig fusion protein to α4β1 was performed exactly as described previously (22Lobb R.R. Antognetti G. Pepinsky R.B. Burkly L.C. Leone D.R. Whitty A. Cell Adhes. Commun. 1995; 3: 385-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). To test the possibility that the central region of Fn comprising the Hep III domain contains cell binding sites, we performed a computer search using the Phylip package program to look for structural homologies with known cell binding sequences in the COOH-terminal region of Fn, namely EILDVPST (CS-1) and IDAPS (H1). The sequence KLDAPT located at the NH2 terminus of repeat III-5 (Fig. 1) showed the highest homology to CS-1 and H1 (Fig. 2). We have named this sequence H2 because of its similarity with H1 both in primary structure and location in a heparin-binding region of Fn (Fig. 1). To determine whether H2 mediated cell adhesion, the synthetic peptide KLDAPT was coupled to KLH and used as adhesion substrate. Peptides KDLAPT-KLH (scramble H2), and CS-1-KLH, were employed as negative and positive controls, respectively. The various cell types used for these experiments and their pattern of surface expression of some integrin receptors are listed in Table I. As shown in Fig. 3, none of the cell lines tested adhered to the H2 peptide under resting conditions. However, incubation with 1 mm Mn2+ (RPMI 8866) or with anti-β1 mAb TS2/16 (Ramos, Jurkat) induced a very efficient dose response to this peptide, similar to that attained for adhesion to CS-1 (Fig. 3). These results suggested that the KLDAPT motif was binding to an integrin and required an activated form of the receptor. TS2/16- or Mn2+-treated cells did not bind to the scramble peptide KDLAPT at any concentration tested (Fig. 3).Table IExpression of adhesion receptors in the cell lines studiedCellsMean fluorescence intensityControlα2α3α4α5αVβ3β1α4β7Ramos0.330.291.024.120.350.275.680.30RPMI 88660.270.270.266.930.261.340.557.68Jurkat0.30nd0.666.801.290.4312.20.28JM0.471.020.5413.00.47nd13.00.60CEM0.140.140.232.160.170.151.250.17K5620.290.280.260.251.240.280.51nd Open table in a new tab As mentioned above, the KLDAPT sequence is located in FN-III5 repeat. We therefore studied whether a fragment containing this repeat (FN-III5 in Fig. 1 B) mediated cell adhesion. As shown in Fig.4, after incubation with TS2/16 mAb or Mn2+, B and T lymphoid cells adhered to this fragment efficiently while K562 cells did not. Resting lymphoid cells did not attach to FN-III5 fragment (shown for Ramos cells in Fig. 4), again indicating that recognition of this region requires an activated integrin. None of the cell types tested (resting or activated) attached to a recombinant fragment containing the FN-III6 repeat (Fig.1 B), confirming that adhesion to FN-III5 was specific (data not shown). These results suggested that KLDAPT was responsible for the adhesion activity observed in FN-III5. To establish whether this sequence could also bind to the cell surface in soluble form and inhibit cell adhesion, TS2/16 treated-Ramos cells were preincubated with various concentrations of H2 or scramble H2 peptides prior to the adhesion assay. As shown in Fig. 5 A, soluble H2 peptide inhibited adhesion of Ramos cells to FN-III5 in a dose-dependent manner, while the control scramble peptide had no effect. Moreover, soluble CS-1 peptide also inhibited Ramos cell adhesion to FN-III5 (Fig. 5 A), suggesting that α4β1 integrin was the receptor for FN-III5. The calculated IC50values in this assay were 5 and 51 μm for CS-1 and H2 peptides, respectively (Fig. 5 A and TableII).Table IIApparent IC50 values of inhibitors of cell adhesion to various substrata or binding of soluble VCAM-Ig-AP to α4β1α4β1 ligandH2CS-1H2.scμmFN-III551538 kDa14530.5VCAM-113325.5VCAM-Ig-AP81.47.9>718IC50 values were similar for Ramos or Jurkat cell adhesion.

Commun. 1995; 3: 385-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). We also examined whether soluble H2 could affect binding of α4β1 to its known ligands. TS2/16-treated Ramos cells were preincubated with 0.5 mg/ml of H2 or the control peptides CS-1 and scramble H2, and tested for adhesion to two Fn fragments of 38 and 80 kDa, which we previously showed to be ligands for resting or activated α4β1, respectively (9Wayner E.A. Garcia-Pardo A. Humphries M.J. McDonald J.A. Carter W.G. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 1321-1330Crossref PubMed Scopus (635) Google Scholar, 22Lobb R.R. Antognetti G. Pepinsky R.B. Burkly L.C. Leone D.R. Whitty A. Cell Adhes. Commun. 1995; 3: 385-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), or to the endothelial ligand VCAM-1 (23Elices M.J. Osborn L. Takada Y. Crouse C. Luhowskyj S. Hemler M.E. Lobb R. Cell. 1990; 60: 577-584Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1530) Google Scholar). The synthetic peptide H2-KLH was included as control substrate in this assay. As shown in Fig. 5 B, preincubation with soluble H2 or CS-1 produced 100% inhibition of adhesion to inmobilized H2-KLH, confirming the specificity of the α4β1 recognition of this sequence. Moreover, H2 completely abolished adhesion to the 80- and 38-kDa fragments, and to VCAM-1, while the control peptide KDLAPT did not affect cell adhesion to any of these substrata (Fig.5 B). To obtain some insight on the affinity of the interaction of KLDAPT with α4β1 integrin we determined the inhibitory effect of various concentrations of H2, CS-1, and scramble H2 peptides on two sets of experiments: 1) on cell adhesion to the 38-kDa fragment (Fig.5 A) or to VCAM-1 (not shown); 2) on binding of recombinant alkaline phosphatase-coupled VCAM-Ig fusion protein to Mn2+-activated α4β1 (22Lobb R.R. Antognetti G. Pepinsky R.B. Burkly L.C. Leone D.R. Whitty A. Cell Adhes. Commun. 1995; 3: 385-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The IC50 values calculated from these experiments are shown in Table II. The preceding results indicated that adhesion to KLDAPT and FN-III5 was mediated by α4β1. This was further confirmed by using specific mAbs to various integrins. As shown in Fig.6, preincubation of TS2/16-treated Ramos cells with HP2/1 (anti-α4) mAb completely inhibited adhesion to both substrata, while Act-1 (anti-α4β7) or LM609 (anti-αVβ3) mAbs had no effect. These results are in agreement with the lack of expression of the last two integrins on Ramos cells (24Postigo A.A. Sánchez-Mateos P. Lazarovits A.I. Sánchez-Madrid F. O. de Landázuri M. J. Immunol. 1993; 151: 2471-2483PubMed Google Scholar) (Table I) and clearly establish that α4β1 is the receptor for H2 and FN-III5 on these cells. However, RPMI 8866 cells, which bound well to H2 and FN-III5 (Figs. 5and 6), express α4β7 and very low levels of β1 on their surface (Table I) (24Postigo A.A. Sánchez-Mateos P. Lazarovits A.I. Sánchez-Madrid F. O. de Landázuri M. J. Immunol. 1993; 151: 2471-2483PubMed Google Scholar, 25Erle D.J. Briskin M.J. Butcher E.C. Garcia-Pardo A. Lazarovits A.I. Tidswell M. J. Immunol. 1994; 153: 517-528PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that α4β7 could be involved in this adhesion. As shown in Fig. 6, both HP2/1 and Act-1 mAbs completely inhibited adhesion of Mn2+-treated RPMI 8866 cells to H2-KLH or FN-III5, therefore indicating that α4β7 is also a functional receptor for the H2 sequence. LM609 mAb had a minor effect (15% inhibition) on adhesion of RPMI 8866 cells to FN-III5, perhaps indicating a small contribution of αVβ3 to the attachment of these cells to this fragment. These results together with the fact that K562 cells, which lack α4 integrins (Table I), do not bind to FN-III5 (or H2-KLH, not shown), clearly establish that KLDAPT is a novel adhesion sequence specifically recognized by activated α4 integrins. In this report we have characterized the function of FN-III5 homology repeat located in the Hep III domain of Fn. The major conclusions are: 1) recombinant fragments containing the FN-III5 repeat mediate adhesion of lymphoid cells, 2) the sequence KLDAPT is the active site in FN-III5 and is sufficient to induce cell adhesion, 3) the synthetic peptide KLDAPT in soluble form efficiently inhibits cell adhesion to different recombinant or proteolytic Fn fragments and to VCAM-1, and 4) the α4β1 and α4β7 integrins are functional receptors for KLDAPT and FN-III5 and require activation for binding. The function of the region of Fn encompassing repeats III4–6 has been largely unknown. Early studies have indicated that this segment contains a weak heparin and DNA binding site(s) (named Hep III domain), but its physiological relevance is unclear (13Calaycay J. Pande H. Lee T.

Cell Res. 1989; 181: 420-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). A recent study has proposed that the region comprising Fn repeats III1–7 may play a regulatory role in the process of matrix formation (26Sechler J.L. Takada Y. Schwarzbauer J.E. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 573-583Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). We show in the present report that a recombinant fragment containing the FN-III5 repeat promotes cell adhesion efficiently and therefore constitutes a new cell binding domain in Fn. We have identified the sequence KLDAPT, located at the amino terminus of FN-III5, as the active site. A synthetic peptide containing this sequence was an effective inhibitor of cell adhesion to FN-III5 and also mediated cell attachment when coupled to KLH. These results clearly demonstrate that interaction with KLDAPT is sufficient for cell binding to the FN-III5 fragment. The present report also establishes that KLDAPT (called H2 throughout this study) is a novel ligand for α4β1 and α4β7 integrins and requires previous activation of both integrins for binding. As we show here, H2 was approximately 5-fold less efficient than the previously identified α4β1 ligand CS-1 in inhibiting cell adhesion to the Fn 38-kDa fragment and VCAM-1, and 10-fold less efficient in inhibiting adhesion to FN-III5 fragment (see Table II). H2 was also 10-fold less efficient than CS-1 in inhibiting binding of soluble VCAM-Ig-alkaline phosphatase, but it was a specific competitor in this assay when compared with the control scramble peptide KDLAPT, which did not inhibit. While these apparent IC50 values certainly provide information on the affinity of the interaction, it should be considered that the different length of H2 and CS-1 peptides (6 versus25 amino acid residues) may also account for the higher efficiency observed for CS-1 inhibition. On the other hand, the fact that recognition of H2 requires an activated integrin for binding suggests a low affinity interaction. This is also supported by the fact that CS-1 is a more efficient inhibitor of adhesion to FN-III5 than to the 38-kDa fragment or VCAM-1 (see Table II). We have recently shown that the low affinity α4β1 ligands H1 and RGD induce different intracellular responses than CS-1 (7Domı́nguez-Jiménez C. Sánchez-Aparicio P. Albar J.P. Garcia-Pardo A. Cell Adhes. Commun. 1996; 4: 251-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Therefore low affinity interactions such as the newly described here are probably phisiologically important in regulating such responses. We and others have previously shown that α4β1, the main Fn receptor in lymphocytes, recognizes several sites located in different regions of Fn. These include CS-1 and CS-5 in IIICS (9Wayner E.A.

EMBO J. 1991; 10: 4089-4095Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar), and RGD in repeat III10 which binds only to activated α4β1 (22Lobb R.R. Antognetti G. Pepinsky R.B. Burkly L.C. Leone D.R. Whitty A. Cell Adhes. Commun. 1995; 3: 385-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). These ligands have a common recognition motif which can be LDV (CS-1), EDV/GDV (CS-5), IDA (H1), and GDS (RGD). The KLDAPT sequence reported here fits well into this pattern and shows that LDA is a novel recognition motif for activated α4β1 and α4β7, present in the FN-III5 repeat. In agreement with this, a recent report (27Jongewaard J.N. Tsai P.M. Smith J.W. Cell Adhes. Commun. 1996; 3: 487-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) has shown that mutants of IIICS in which the wild-type sequence EILDVP was changed to EILDAP, supported adhesion of CHO-α4 transfected cells almost as effectively as the native sequence. This group also reported that increasing the time of the assay could overcome the impaired adhesion observed for certain mutants. In this regard, we have observed that, while cell adhesion to the synthetic peptide KLDAPT-KLH reached saturation within 30 min, adhesion to FN-III5 required longer incubation times. Although we do not have an explanation for this, it is possible that the higher ligand density obtained when using the peptide as a substrate overcomes the low affinity/avidity of the interaction. The novel active sequence KLDAPT found in FN-III5 repeat is highly homologous to AIDAPS or H1 site previously identified in FN-III14 repeat (6Mould A.P. Humphries M.J. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 4089-4095Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). It is interesting that both sequences lie in exposed loops outside the β strand structures present in type III homology repeats (28Main A.L. Harvey T.S. Baron M. Boyd J. Campbell I.D. Cell. 1992; 71: 671-678Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar). This observation and the fact that both repeats are in heparin binding regions of Fn suggest that there is a structural and functional homology between FN-III5 and FN-III14 modules. However, the ability of both repeats to interact with α4β1 is different because FN-III5 induces adhesion only through an activated integrin. The results reported here therefore extend our previous findings showing that activated α4β1 binds the RGD sequence in FN-III10 repeat (21Sánchez-Aparicio P. Domı́nguez-Jiménez C. Garcia-Pardo A. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 271-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) and definitely establish that activated and resting α4β1 have different properties (7Domı́nguez-Jiménez C. Sánchez-Aparicio P. Albar J.P. Garcia-Pardo A. Cell Adhes. Commun. 1996; 4: 251-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The multiplicity of Fn sequences that bind α4β1 (or α4β7) in lymphoid cells may provide a mechanism for a stepwise interaction of these integrins with sites in different Fn repeats, depending on the activation form of the receptor. Alternatively, it is possible that the KLDAPT site and perhaps other unidentified sites within the FN-III4–6 region, are cryptic and become active and exposed upon Fn degradation or subsequent to conformational changes. Several biological activities have been shown to be present in proteolytic fragments but not in intact Fn. These include the chemotactic activity found on a 120-kDa fragment (29Clark R.A.F. Wikner N.E. Doherty D.E. Norris D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 12115-12123Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and a major Fn self-association site located in repeat III1 (30Hocking D.C. Sottile J. McKeown-Longo P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19183-19191Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The novel cell binding activity found in FN-III5 may be important in situations where Fn fragments are actively produced such as inflammatory sites and damaged tissues. Lymphocytes and other leukocytes recruited to these sites are usually activated bearing the high affinity form of integrins on their surface. Fn fragments derived from the Hep III region may therefore serve to recruit activated cells to these sites and to provide a substrate for their further attachment. We thank Drs. D. Cheresh, D. J. Ringler, and F.

SDF-1α and SDF-1β were believed to be the result of differential splicing of a single gene, with SDF-1α missing four amino acids in the carboxyl terminus. The CXCR4/Fusin/LESTR has been identified as one of the functional receptors for SDF-1 (3Bleul C.C. Fazzan M. Choe H. Parolin C. Clark-Lewis I. Sodroski J. Springer T.A.

Kennedy P.E. Berger E.A. Science. 1996; 272: 872-877Crossref PubMed Scopus (3624) Google Scholar). In addition to its activities on human leukocytes, SDF-1 has been shown to inhibit the fusion and replication of T lymphotropic HIV-1 in host cells bearing CD4 and CXCR4 (3Bleul C.C. Fazzan M.

Therefore, SDF-1 plays a pivotal role in host immune system and its defense against infection. Rapid production of cytokines and chemokines is essential for structure-function studies and design of molecules with agonist or antagonist activities. The turbocharged peptide synthesis technology (14Schnolzer M. Alewood P. Jones A Alwood D. Kent S.B.H. Int. J. Pept. Protein Res. 1992; 40: 180-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (938) Google Scholar) and chemical ligation of peptide segments (15Dawson P.E. Muir T.W. Clark-Lewis I. Kent S.B.H. Science. 1994; 266: 776-779Crossref PubMed Scopus (3139) Google Scholar) permit the synthesis of chemokines in large quantity. This approach was therefore utilized to synthesize SDF-1α based on its great utility in studies of immune responses and infectious diseases. However, the thioacid peptide (SDF-1α(1–33)-αCOSH) could not be readily generated on the standard α-thiocarboxylate resin (16Canne L.E. Walker S.M. Kent S.B.H. Tetrahedron Lett. 1995; 36: 1217-1220Crossref Scopus (74) Google Scholar) due to the presence of an Asn33 residue at the ligation site in SDF-1α. Instead, alanine was coupled to the α-thiocarboxylate resin, then the mutant SDF-1α(1–33, N33A) was synthesized. In this study, we report that this SDF-1α analogue, N33A, displays full biological activity through the activation of the receptor CXCR4. This analogue, which can be rapidly produced in large quantity in the absence of contaminating peptides, will prove to be an important tool in the study of host immunity and AIDS. Human recombinant SDF-1α was purchased from PeproTech Inc. (Rocky Hill, NJ). Radioiodination of the SDF-1α and the analogue N33A was performed by a lactoperoxidase-labeling procedure. The radioactive ligands were further purified by reversed phase HPLC. The specific activity of the radioiodinated chemokines was 2200 Ci/mmol. Boc protected amino acids were obtained from the following sources: AnaSpec (San Jose, CA), Bachem (Philadelphia, PA), NovaBiochem (San Diego, CA), and Peptides International (Louisville, KY). Peptides were synthesized on a modified ABI430A instrument using in situ neutralization Boc chemistry protocols (17Canne L.E. Ferre-D'Amare A.R. Burley S.K. Kent S.B.H.J. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1995; 117: 2998-3007Crossref Scopus (179) Google Scholar). C-terminal segments were prepared on –OCH2Pam resins (ABI, Foster City, CA). N-terminal segments were prepared on α-thiocarboxylate resin (16Canne L.E. Walker S.M. Kent S.B.H. Tetrahedron Lett. 1995; 36: 1217-1220Crossref Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Standard HF cleavage protocols were employed following N-terminal Boc removal and drying of the resin. HPLC purification was performed on Rainin HPLCs (Woburn, MA) using Vydac C4 or Dynamax C4 columns with gradient elution (A, H2O, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid; B, acetonitrile, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid). Electrospray mass spectrometry was performed on a Sciex API1(PE-Sciex). Ligation of the peptide segments was performed at 4 mmpeptide concentration in 6 m guanidine, 0.1 mTris, pH 7, in the presence of 33 mm thiophenol (Fluka, Switzerland) at room temperature. Ligation was monitored by HPLC and was typically complete within 24 h. Ligation was followed by HPLC purification and lyophilization. After purification, the full-length peptide was reduced at 1 mg/ml in 8 m urea (Fluka), 0.1m Tris (Fluka), 5.37 mm EDTA ((Fluka), pH 8.6, in the presence of 100 mm 2-mercaptoethanol (Fluka). Reduction occurs under a nitrogen atmosphere at 40 °C for 1 h. After complete reduction, the mixture was reconstituted with the same buffer at 0.2 mg/ml with 18.7 mm oxidized glutathione (Sigma). The solution was dispensed into a Spectrum Spectra/Por*7 dialysis membrane (Houston, TX) (M r cut-off, 3500) and the bag was placed in 1 liter of initial dialysis buffer of 8m urea, 0.1 m Tris, 1 mm EDTA, 3 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 1.3 mm oxidized glutathione, pH 8.6. Over a period of 2 days, 4 liters of 2m urea, 0.1 m Tris, pH 8.6, was pumped into the vessel containing the dialysis bag (18Maeda Y. Ueda T. Imoto T. Protein Eng. 1996; 9: 95-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). After lyophilization, the full-length peptide was oxidized at 1 mg/ml in 2 mguanidine HCl (Fluka), 0.1 m Tris (Fluka), pH 8.6, at room temperature in the presence of air. Folding was complete after stirring overnight and was monitored by HPLC and mass spectrometry. Human peripheral blood leukocytes were isolated from normal donors (National Institutes of Health Clinical Center Transfusion Department, Bethesda, MD) according to the established protocols in this laboratory for purification of monocytes (purity was >90%) (19Xu L.L.

Leukocyte migration was evaluated using a 48-well microchamber (Neuroprobe, Cabin John, MD) technique as described previously (19Xu L.L. MacVicar D.W. Ben-Baruch A. Kuhns D.B. Johnston J.

The results are expressed as the the chemotaxis index (CI) representing the fold increase in the cell migration induced by stimuli versus control medium. All experiments were performed at least two times, and results from one experiment are shown. The statistical significance of the difference between migration in response to stimuli and control was assessed by Student'st test. Binding assays were performed using a single concentration of125I-labeled chemokines in the presence of increasing concentrations of unlabeled ligands (19Xu L.L. MacVicar D.W. Ben-Baruch A.

Munson, Division of Computer Research and Technology, NIH, Bethesda, MD). In Scatchard plots, the binding data were analyzed with both “one-site” and “two-site” models, and only the one-site model better fit the curves obtained with either native leukocytes or CXCR4/293 cells. The rate of competition for binding by unlabeled ligands was calculated with the following formula:%inhibition=1−(binding in the presence of unlabeledEquation 1 chemokine/binding in the presence of medium alone)×100 We first examined whether the SDF-1α analogue N33A was able to bind and activate human peripheral blood monocytes and T cells. Fig.1 shows that 125I-N33A specifically bound to human peripheral blood monocytes (Fig.1 A) and T lymphocytes (Fig. 1 B) with high affinity (1.8 and 1.4 nm for monocytes and T cells, respectively). This level of binding to monocytes and T cells by125I-N33A was comparable to that of125I-rhSDF-1α as examined in parallel experiments (data not shown). Unlabeled N33A displaced 125I-rhSDF-1α binding to both monocytes and T lymphocytes (Fig. 1, C andD), and likewise, the binding of 125I-N33A to these cell types was also displaced by both unlabeled N33A and rhSDF-1α (not shown). Consistent and considerable migration of monocytes and T cells was induced by N33A (Fig.2). The potency and efficacy of N33A in the induction of mononuclear cell migration was comparable with rhSDF-1α, suggesting that chemically synthesized N33A retains the tertiary structure and functions as well as rhSDF-1α.Figure 2Chemotactic response of monocytes and T cells to N33A and rhSDF-1α. Different concentrations of N33A or rhSDF-1α were placed in the lower wells of the microchemotaxis chamber. The cells were placed in the upper wells, which were separated from the lower wells by polycarbonate filters.

While some investigators failed to detect chemotactic activity of SDF-1 for neutrophils (1Bleul C.C. Fuhlbrigge R.C. Casasnovas J.M. Aiuti A. Springer T.A. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 184: 1101-1109Crossref PubMed Scopus (1274) Google Scholar), others were able to induce significant Ca2+ mobilization in neutrophils at physiologically relevant concentrations of SDF-1 (4Oberlin E. Amara A. Bachelerie F. Bessia C. Virelizier J-L. Arenzana-Seisdedos F. Schwartz O. Heard J.-M. Clark-Lewis I. Legler D.F. Loetscher M. Baggiolini M. Moser B. Nature. 1996; 382: 833-835Crossref PubMed Scopus (1478) Google Scholar). In an effort to clarify the activity of SDF-1 on neutrophils, we tested the binding and function of N33A on neutrophils in comparison rhSDF-1α. As shown in Fig.3, human peripheral blood neutrophils expressed a substantial number of specific binding sites for both N33A (Fig. 3 A) and native SDF-1α (Fig. 3 B). The binding is of high affinity with estimated K d values of about 5 nm. N33A and rhSDF-1α competed equally well for each other's binding as shown by the displacement curve (Fig.3 C and data not shown). Neutrophils also migrated in response to both N33A and rhSDF-1α, indicating that neutrophils are indeed among the target cell types for SDF-1. To further confirm that N33A utilizes CXCR4 as its functional receptor, HEK293 cells stably expressing CXCR4 (CXCR4/293 cells) were employed. Wild type HEK 293 cells exhibited a low level of specific binding (about 200 binding sites/cell) for both N33A and native SDF-1α. Both N33A and native SDF-1 also induced a weak but significant directional migration of wild type HEK293 cells (CI = 2.1 ± 0.2, at 120 nm ligand concentration). This is in agreement with the notion that a great variety of nonhematopoietic cells express CXCR4 mRNA. However, HEK293 cells overexpressing CXCR4 expressed markedly increased number of specific binding sites for radiolabeled N33A and rhSDF-1α (Fig. 4, A andB). N33A and rhSDF-1α mutually competed for binding to CXCR4/293 cells (Fig. 4, C and D). Both N33A and rhSDF-1α were able to induce a remarkable directional migration of CXCR4/293 cells (Fig. 5) with similar potency and efficacy. HEK293 cells transfected with known chemokine receptors, including CXCR1, CXCR2, and CCR1–5, did not show any increased binding or activation by N33A or rhSDF-1α over background levels, whereas these cells specifically bound and migrated in response to their ligands (data not shown). These results demonstrate that N33A, like rhSDF-1α, uses CXCR4 as a functional receptor.Figure 5Chemotactic response of CXCR4/293 cells induced by N33A and rhSDF-1α. CXCR4/293 cell migration was measured by 300 min incubation at 37 °C in microchemotaxis chambers as described previously (21Ben-Baruch A. Xu L. Young P.R. Bengali K. Oppenheim J.J. Wang J.M. J. Biol.

SDF-1 is a member of the CXC chemokine subfamily and was first identified as a molecule possessing pre-B cell-stimulatory activity (29Nagasawa T. Kikutani H. Kishimoto T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 2305-2309Crossref PubMed Scopus (705) Google Scholar, 30Tashiro K. Tada H. Heilker R. Shirozu M. Nakano T. Honjo T. Science. 1993; 261: 600-603Crossref PubMed Scopus (636) Google Scholar). It was later described as a chemoattractant for resting T lymphocytes and monocytes (1Bleul C.C. Fuhlbrigge R.C. Casasnovas J.M. Aiuti A. Springer T.A. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 184: 1101-1109Crossref PubMed Scopus (1274) Google Scholar). As a CXC chemokine, SDF-1 has several unique features in comparison to other members of the same family. SDF-1 mRNA is expressed constitutively in virtually every tissue including heart, liver, lung, brain, muscle, spleen, and kidney (28Cocchi F. DeVico A.L. Garzino-Demo A. Arya S.K. Gallo R.C. Lusso P. Science. 1995; 270: 1811-1815Crossref PubMed Scopus (2625) Google Scholar, 29Nagasawa T. Kikutani H. Kishimoto T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Science. 1993; 261: 600-603Crossref PubMed Scopus (636) Google Scholar). Expression of SDF-1 gene is not affected by proinflammatory stimuli (31Jiang W. Zhou P. Kahn S.M. Tomita N. Johnson M.D. Weinstein I.B. Exp. Cell Res. 1994; 215: 284-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), in contrast to most other chemokines which are mainly expressed in response to proinflammatory cytokines and are believed to regulate the recruitment and activation of mature leukocytes at inflammatory foci (6Oppenheim J.J. Wang J.M. Chertov O. Taub D.D. Ben-Baruch A. Tilney L.N. Strom T.B. Paul L.C. Transplantation Biology: Cellular and Molecular Aspects.

In the absence of inflammation, blood monocytes constantly replace mononuclear phagocytes in the tissue, sustaining a stable level by extravasation from blood stream and undergoing differentiation into macrophages. SDF-1 displays a tissue distribution that is considered appropriate for function in lymphocyte recirculation, in basal recruitment of monocytes and in normal replenishment and turnover of tissue mononuclear phagocytes (1Bleul C.C. Fuhlbrigge R.C. Casasnovas J.M. Aiuti A. Springer T.A. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 184: 1101-1109Crossref PubMed Scopus (1274) Google Scholar,30Tashiro K. Tada H. Heilker R. Shirozu M. Nakano T. Honjo T.

Neuroimmunol. 1995; 58: 167-176Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). However, neutrophils do not normally infiltrate organs or tissues even though these cells express binding sites for and migrate in response to SDF-1α in vitro, as further demonstrated in the current study. Thus, the role for SDF-1 as a primordial chemokine regulating primarily the tissue distribution of leukocytes needs further investigation. SDF-1 also has several essential functions in development (2Nagasawa T. Hirota S. Tachibana K. Takakura N. Nishikawa S. Kitamura Y. Yoshida N. Kikutani H. Kishimoto T. Nature. 1996; 382: 635-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (1999) Google Scholar). Mice lacking SDF-1 due to homologous recombination died perinatally and although the numbers of B cell progenitors in mutant embryos were severely reduced in fetal liver and bone marrow, myeloid progenitors were reduced only in the bone marrow not in the fetal liver, indicating that SDF-1 is responsible for B cell lymphopoiesis and bone marrow myelopoiesis. In addition, mice deprived of SDF-1 gene had a cardiac ventricular septal defect (2Nagasawa T. Hirota S. Tachibana K. Takakura N. Nishikawa S. Kitamura Y. Yoshida N. Kikutani H. Kishimoto T. Nature. 1996; 382: 635-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (1999) Google Scholar). The SDF-1α analogue N33A was chemically synthesized and was shown in this study to be equally as potent as native SDF-1α in binding and activating human leukocytes as well as CXCR4-transfected HEK293 cells. N33A has also been shown to induce human B lymphocyte migration and to effectively inhibit infection of PM-1 cells by HIV-1(LAV). 2M. A. Siani, D. A. Thompson, L. E. Canne, G. M. Figliozzi, S. B. H.

The preparation of analogues is greatly facilitated by molecular chemical synthesis, in which proteins can be produced either singly or by combinational methods. The analogues could include a full range of genetically encoded amino acids as well as unnatural backbone structures and unclonable residues such as d-amino acids, fluorescent or nuclear magnetic resonance-sensitive nuclei. The activities of analogues can also be tuned by fast cycles of synthesis-design-assay-resynthesis (33Robson B. Nat. Biotechnol. 1996; 14: 892-893Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). The validity of this approach is demonstrated by the fact that it yields functional molecules such as the SDF-1α analogue N33A, a biological contamination-free agonist of SDF-1 that can be utilized in studies of the immune system and host defense against AIDS.

ATP synthase catalyzes ATP synthesis coupled with proton flow across the energy-transducing membranes such as bacterial plasma membranes, mitochondrial inner membranes, and chloroplast thylakoid membranes (for review, see Refs. 1Senior A.E.

F1-ATPase is comprised of five kinds of subunits with a stoichiometry of α3β3γ1δ1ε1. The catalytic sites are located mainly in β subunits but also contain side chains arising from α subunit (4Abrahams J.P. Leslie A. Lutter R. Walker J.E.

FEBS Lett. 1995; 368: 207-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The α3β3γ complex of F1-ATPase has been recognized as a minimum ATPase-active complex with similar stability and common characteristics to native F1-ATPase (6Yokoyama K. Hisabori T. Yoshida M. J.

The rotation of γ subunit is thought to be essential for the coupling between ATP synthesis/hydrolysis and proton flow. How the other subunits of F1-ATPase and Fo are involved in the rotational coupling is currently receiving attention. The δ and ε subunits, together with γ subunit, are considered to form a stalk portion that connects F1-ATPase to membrane-embedded proton channel, Fo (13Yoshida M. Okamoto H. Sone N. Hirata H.

Leslie A. Lutter R. Walker J.E. Nature. 1994; 370: 621-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (2754) Google Scholar). Thus, δ subunit is currently considered as a stator that connects the α3β3 hexamer ring to Fo. According to the recent structural study by NMR, ε subunit of Escherichia coli F1-ATPase (EF1) 1The abbreviations used are: EF1, TF1, CF1, and MF1, F1-ATPase from Escherichia coli, thermophilicBacillus PS3, chloroplasts, and mitochondria, respectively; native-PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in the absence of denaturing reagent; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; TNP-AT(D)P, 2′,3′-O-(2,4,6-trinitrophenyl) derivatives of AT(D)P; (+ε) complex, α3β3γε and α3β3γδε complexes of F1-ATPase; (−ε) complex, α3β3γ and α3β3γδ complexes of F1-ATPase; AMP-PNP, adenosine 5′-(β,γ imino)triphosphate; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography; kbp, kilobase pair. consists of N-terminal β-sandwich domain and C-terminal α-helical domain (25Wilkens S.

ATPase activity of CF1 is enhanced by either reduction of the disulfide bond of γ subunit or removal of ε subunit (28Nalin C.M. McCarty R.E. J. Biol.

Recently, Capaldi and co-worker (30Tang C. Capaldi R.A. J. Biol.

Interestingly, ε subunit changes the partner subunit of cross-linking dependent on the nucleotide in the solution.(31Aggeler R. Capaldi R.A. J. Biol.

In this study, to know the function of δ and ε subunits in catalysis of F1-ATPase, we compared kinetics of the homogeneous preparation of α3β3γ, α3β3γδ, α3β3γε, and α3β3γδε complexes of the F1-ATPase from thermophilic Bacillus strain PS3 (TF1). The results indicate that the ε-containing (+ε) complex can exist in two forms, inhibited form and activated form, and the former is converted to the latter without dissociation of ε subunit during catalytic turnover. DNA fragment containing TF1 δ subunit gene was prepared by polymerase chain reaction. Primer oligonucleotides were designed to introduce new restriction sites at both ends of the δ subunit gene (5′-AAGAATTCATATGAACCAAGAAGTGATCGCC-3′ (EcoRI and NdeI) and 5′-AAGGATCCTTAGCCGATCAGCTGCCGC-3′ (BamHI), introduced restriction sites are shown in parentheses). Polymerase chain reaction was carried out with recombinant Taq DNA polymerase as described by the manufacturer (Takara, Japan) using the plasmid that contained TF1 δ subunit gene as a template. The amplified fragments were digested with EcoRI and BamHI and cloned into EcoRI-BamHI sites of pUC118 (32Vieira J. Messing J. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 153: 3-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (2009) Google Scholar) to create pUC118-δ. pUC118-δ was digested with EcoRI andPstI, and the 0.5-kbp fragment containing TF1δ gene was cloned into EcoRI-PstI sites of pKK223–3 (33Brosius J. Holy A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 6929-6933Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar) to create pKD2 in which TF1 δ gene was placed under the tac promoter. pKD2 was used as the expression plasmid for E. coli strain JM109 (34Yanisch-Perron C. Vieira J. Messing J. Gene ( Amst. ). 1985; 33: 103-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (11465) Google Scholar). pTF1 (7Matsui T. Yoshida M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1231: 139-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) carrying entire TFoF1 genes was digested with EcoRI and its termini were blunted. Then the fragment was further digested with PstI, and the resulting 6.7-kbp fragment containing TFoF1 genes was cloned intoPstI-HindIII sites of pTD-tac (35Date T. Tanihara K. Numura N. Gene ( Amst. ). 1990; 90: 141-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) whose HindIII-digested terminus had been blunted. Resulting plasmid, pTD-tac-TFoF1, was digested withSmaI, and the resulting 3.3-kbp fragment containing TF1 ε gene was self-ligated to create pTD-tac-ε. pTD-tac-ε was then digested withEcoRI and HpaI. The resulting 0.6-kbp fragment containing TF1 ε gene was cloned intoEcoRI-HincII sites of pTD-T7 to create pTD-T7-ε. For efficient expression, the upstream region of the TF1 ε gene was removed (52 base pair) by the loop-out mutagenesis (36Kunkel T.A. Bebenek K. McClary J. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 204: 125-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (633) Google Scholar). Primer oligonucleotide (5′-GATCGTTTTCATAGCTGTTTCCTG-3′) containing both complementary sequence to 5′-terminus of ε subunit gene and the downstream region of the T7 promoter was used. Resulting plasmid was named pTE2, in which TF1 ε gene was under the control of T7 promoter. pTE2 was used as the expression plasmid for E. coli strain BL21(DE3) (37Studier F.W. Rosenberg A.H. Dunn J.J. Dubendorff J.W. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 185: 60-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (6005) Google Scholar), which harbors T7 RNA polymerase gene under the induciblelacUV5 promoter in its genomic DNA. E. coli strain JM109/pKD2 was grown in 3 liters of Terrific Broth containing 50 μg/ml ampicillin in a jar fermenter with strong agitation and aeration at 37 °C. WhenA 600 reached to about 0.6, an inducer, isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside was added to final concentration of 0.7 mm. After 7 h from induction, cells were harvested by centrifugation at 5000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. About 6 g (wet weight) of JM109/pKD2 cells per liter of culture media were obtained. All the following procedures were performed at 4 °C. About 5 g of cells were suspended in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) and 1 mm EDTA (buffer A) at 0.2 g cells/ml and then were disrupted by a French pressure system (1400 kgf/cm2). About half of the expressed protein was recovered in the soluble fraction of the cell lysate, and the other half was in the insoluble fraction. Soluble fraction was subjected to successive centrifugations, at 6000 × g for 15 min and at 200,000 × g for 20 min. Then saturated ammonium sulfate solution (pH 7.7, adjusted by ammonia solution) was added to 35% saturation. The fraction containing TF1 δ was precipitated by centrifugation for 10 min at 12,000 ×g. The precipitant was dissolved in buffer A, and saturated ammonium sulfate solution (pH 7.7) was added to 10% saturation. Then the fraction was applied to a Butyl-Toyopearl column (3 × 1.4 cm, Tosoh, Japan) equilibrated with buffer A containing 10% saturated concentration of ammonium sulfate. The column was washed with the same buffer (30 ml), and a 10–0% saturated ammonium sulfate linear gradient in buffer A (total 60 ml) was applied. A trace amount of TF1 δ was eluted at this step. With a gradient between buffer A and distilled water (total 60 ml), TF1 δ was eluted as a peak fraction at the end of the gradient. The purified protein solution was frozen by liquid nitrogen and stored at −80 °C until use. About 3 mg of purified δ subunit was obtained from 1 g of wet cells. ε subunit was prepared from E. coli strain BL21(DE3)/pTE2 as described previously (38Hisabori T. Kato Y. Motohashi K. Kroth-Pancic P. Strotmann H. Amano T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 247: 1158-1165Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). α3β3γ complex and δ or ε or both subunits were mixed in 50 mmTris-HCl (pH 8) at molar ratio about 1:3:4 (α3β3γ:δ:ε) and incubated at room temperature for more than 15 min with mild stirring. Final concentration of α3β3γ complex was set around 1–5 mg/ml. Excess subunits were removed by repetitive ultra-filtration with a centrifuge concentrator, Centricon-100 (cut offM r = 100,000, Amicon). Protein solution was diluted to 2 ml and concentrated to less than 200 μl by the centrifugation at 1000 × g for 15–30 min at 25 °C. Then 1.8 ml of 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8) was added to the concentrate and centrifugation was repeated 4 times. Steady-state ATPase activities at 1 μm to 5.3 mm ATP were measured spectrophotometrically by using an ATP regenerating system (39Stiggal D.L. Galante Y.M. Hatefi Y. Methods Enzymol. 1979; 55: 308-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) at 25 °C as described previously (40Kato Y. Sasayama T. Muneyuki E. Yoshida M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1231: 275-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). ATP-Mg solution was prepared by mixing ATP-Tris salt (Sigma) with equal molar of MgCl2. The reaction was initiated by the addition of the subunit complexes (typically 10 μl of 0.1 mg/ml) to the ATPase assay solution (1.0 or 1.2 ml). The absorbance at 340 nm were measured every 1 s for 20 min in a spectrophotometer UV-2200 (Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan), and the data were stored in an on-line computer. Single-site catalysis was measured using TNP-ATP as a substrate. A reaction mixture (50 μl) containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8), 4 mm MgCl2, 200 mm KCl, and 0.3 μm TNP-ATP was incubated at 25 °C. The reaction was initiated by the addition of equal volumes of 1 μmsubunit complexes of TF1 in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8). The reaction was quenched by the addition of 5 μl of ice-cold 24% perchloric acid. In ATP-chase experiments, 10 μl of 30 mm ATP-Mg was added instead of perchloric acid. After 5 s, the reaction was quenched by the addition of 5 μl of ice-cold 24% perchloric acid. The amounts of TNP-ATP and TNP-ADP were measured by HPLC as described previously (41Hisabori T. Muneyuki E. Odaka M. Yokoyama K. Mochizuki K. Yoshida M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 4551-4556Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). TNP-ATP binding to the TF1 subunit complexes were measured in a spectrofluorometer FP-777 (JASCO, Tokyo, Japan) under the condition of single-site catalysis (42Grubmeyer C. Penefsky H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 3718-3727Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The excitation and emission wavelengths were 410 and 548 nm, respectively. The slit widths of excitation and emission were set at 10 and 20 nm, respectively. The assay mixture contained 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8), 100 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, and 0.15 μm TNP-ATP. The assay mixture (1.2 ml) was transferred to a glass cuvette and incubated at 25 °C. The reaction was initiated by the addition of 25 μl of 23 μm subunit complex in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8) (final 0.47 μm). Rapid mixing was achieved by a magnetic stirring bar in the cuvette. The base-line shift, due to the addition of the enzyme solution to the solution without TNP-ATP, was subtracted. Time course of the change in fluorescent intensity was measured every 1 s and stored in an on-line computer. α3β3γε complex (1 mg/ml) was incubated with 4 mm ATP-Mg in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8) at room temperature (130 μl). After the 2-min incubation, 15 μl of the enzyme solution was added to 1.2 ml of ATPase assay mixture that contained no ATP (49 μm ATP final concentration). The ATPase activity presented in Fig. 6 A was taken from the velocity at 30–50 s after the initiation of the ATPase assay. The rest of the sample (100 μl, 3-min incubation with ATP) was subjected to gel-filtration HPLC (G3000SWXL (Tosoh, Japan)) equilibrated with 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.1), 100 mm KCl, and 1 mm ATP-Mg. The column was eluted at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. A peak fraction was concentrated with centrifuge concentrator Microcon 100 (cut off M r = 100,000, Amicon), and their subunit composition was analyzed by SDS- and native-PAGE. Restriction endonucleases were obtained from Toyobo and Takara. Other chemicals were the highest grade commercially available. α3β3γ complex of TF1 was prepared as described previously (7Matsui T. Yoshida M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1231: 139-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Purified α3β3γ complex contained less than 0.1 mol of adenine nucleotides/mol of enzyme when analyzed by HPLC (41Hisabori T. Muneyuki E. Odaka M. Yokoyama K. Mochizuki K. Yoshida M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 4551-4556Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). TF1 was prepared as described previously (43Yoshida M. Sone N. Hirata H. Kagawa Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 7910-7916Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). One unit of enzyme activity was defined as that producing 1 μmol of ADP per min at the specified ATP concentration. Recombinant DNA procedures were performed as described in a manual (44Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual.2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). E. coli strain JM109 was used for preparation of plasmids, and CJ236 (36Kunkel T.A. Bebenek K. McClary J. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 204: 125-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (633) Google Scholar) was used for generating uracil-containing single-stranded plasmids for site-directed mutagenesis. TNP-ATP was prepared according to Hiratsuka and Uchida (45Hiratsuka T. Uchida K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1973; 320: 635-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 46Hiratsuka T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1982; 719: 509-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Protein concentration was determined by the method of Bradford (47Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216391) Google Scholar) using bovine serum albumin as a standard or by the UV absorbance using the factor 0.45 at 280 nm as 1 mg/ml (48Yoshida M. Sone N. Hirata H. Kagawa Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 3480-3485Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in the presence of 0.1% SDS was performed as described by Laemmli (49Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207211) Google Scholar). The protein bands in gels were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250. N-terminal amino acid sequencing was performed as described previously (50Tozawa K. Odaka M. Date T. Yoshida M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16484-16490Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and confirmed that both δ and ε subunits had the same N-terminal amino acid sequences, starting with the N-terminal methionines, as those of subunits contained in the authentic TF1 (51Ohta S. Yohda M. Ishizuka M. Hirata H. Hamamoto T. Otawara-Hamamoto Y. Matsuda K. Kagawa Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1988; 933: 141-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). The subunit complexes with desired subunit combinations were obtained by a simple procedure: mixing the α3β3γ with δ and/or ε subunits, short incubation at room temperature, and repeated ultrafiltration to remove excess subunits. Analysis of thus obtained subunit complexes by SDS-PAGE showed that the preparations contained the expected subunits (Fig.1 A). Staining intensities of δ and/or ε bands relative to those of the bands of α and β subunits in each lane were apparently the same as those of the authentic TF1, suggesting the same subunit stoichiometry of the complexes as that of authentic TF1. Each preparation of the subunit complex was electrophoresed in native-PAGE as a single band with different electrophoretic mobility (Fig. 1 B). Interestingly, the mobility was not simply parallel to the molecular masses of the complexes; in the order α3β3γδ > α3β3γ > α3β3γδε = TF1 > α3β3γε. This enabled us to distinguish each complex and ensured the homogeneity of the prepared subunit complexes. The mobility of the subunit complex reconstituted from the α3β3γ complex and δ and ε subunits was the same as that of the authentic TF1 in native-PAGE (Fig. 1 B, lanes 5and 6), confirming again that the reconstituted subunit complex had normal subunit stoichiometry (α3β3γ1δ1ε1). When 1 mm ATP-Mg was included in all of the solutions used for electrophoresis, the sample buffer, electrode buffer, and gels of native-PAGE, the same electrophoretic patterns as those in the absence of ATP were observed (Fig. 1 C). If total or partial dissociation of δ and/or ε subunits from the complexes occurred during ATP hydrolysis, the electrophoretic mobility of the band should have shifted or the band should have split into two bands. Therefore, the fact that each complex was electrophoresed in the presence of ATP-Mg as a single band with its characteristic mobility indicates that the complex is stable during ATP hydrolysis. Time courses of ATP hydrolysis by subunit complexes were examined at various ATP concentrations (1 μm-5.3 mm). As shown in Fig. 2, the presence of δ subunit in the subunit complexes has slight inhibitory effect on ATPase activity. This was most distinct at 5.3 mm ATP (Fig. 2 C) where about 20% of inhibitions were observed. The effect of ε subunit was more profound than that of δ subunit, and the complexes can be classified into two groups according to the similarity of profiles of time courses, that is, the ε-less (−ε) complexes (α3β3γ and α3β3γδ) and the ε-containing (+ε) complexes (α3β3γε and α3β3γδε). When the (−ε) complexes were mixed with the assay solution containing a low concentration of ATP, 50 μm for instance as shown in Fig. 2 A, ATP hydrolysis proceeded with three phases as previously reported for mitochondrial F1-ATPase (MF1) and for α3β3γ complex of TF1; initial fast phase (<10 s), partially inhibited intermediate phase (10–300 s), and final, reactivated steady-state phase (>300 s) (52Jault J.-M. Allison W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1558-1566Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 53Jault J.-M. Matsui T. Jault F.M. Kaibara C. Muneyuki E. Yoshida M. Kagawa Y. Allison W.S. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 16412-16418Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The (+ε) complexes showed different time courses. There was a long lag phase, that is, an initial inhibited rate of hydrolysis was slowly activated to the final rate. Values of the ATPase activities at the final phase of the (+ε) complexes were still smaller than that of the final phase activity of the (−ε) complexes. Hydrolysis of 500 μm ATP by the (+ε) complexes occurred with a shorter lag period, and the final value of the ATPase activity reached almost the same magnitude as that of the (−ε) complexes (Fig.2 B). At ATP concentrations above 1 mm, as shown in Fig. 2 C where ATP was 5.3 mm, a lag period apparently disappeared and profiles of time courses by the four complexes became similar to each other except that the initial high activity phase (<20 s) was more pronounced for the (−ε) complexes. Reflecting the ATP concentration dependence of the extent of activation, s-v plot for the (+ε) complexes exhibited apparently sigmoidal shape (data not shown). Reasonably, kinetic behavior of the authentic TF1 in these experiments were all the same as those of the α3β3γδε complex although the specific activity of the former was somehow slightly lower (approximately 70%) than that of the latter. As reported previously (8Kaibara C. Matsui T. Hisabori T. Yoshida M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2433-2438Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), α3β3γ complex hydrolyzed a substoichiometric amount of TNP-ATP, and this hydrolysis was promoted by chase-added ATP (Fig.3 A). In a very similar manner, α3β3γδ complex also hydrolyzed TNP-ATP, and the hydrolysis was promoted by chase-added ATP (Fig.3 B). The typical single-site catalysis and chase-promotion indicate that most TNP-ATP bound rapidly to a single high affinity catalytic site of the (−ε) complexes upon mixing, and ATP occupation of (or ATP hydrolysis at) the second catalytic site accelerates otherwise slow hydrolysis of bound TNP-ATP. In contrast, the (+ε) complexes and authentic TF1 hydrolyzed substoichiometric TNP-ATP only slowly, and the chase-added ATP did not promote it (Fig.3, C-E). These different behaviors of the (+ε) complexes can be explained by assuming slow TNP-ATP binding or impairment of catalytic site cooperativity. To know which was the case, we directly measured TNP-ATP binding to the complexes with fluorescence change of TNP-ATP accompanied by its binding to the enzyme (42Grubmeyer C. Penefsky H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 3718-3727Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig.4). The concentrations of TNP-ATP and the complexes were the same as those in Fig. 3. Upon mixing the (−ε) complexes with TNP-ATP solution (Fig. 4, tracesα3β3γ and α3β3γδ), fluorescence jumped within a dead period of measurement and a slow, small increase of fluorescence followed. This suggested that most TNP-ATP bound rapidly to the (−ε) complexes although a small residual fraction of TNP-ATP bound slowly. As shown previously (8Kaibara C. Matsui T. Hisabori T. Yoshida M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2433-2438Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), produced TNP-ADP did not dissociate from the complexes since intensity of fluorescence was not decreased even after it reached saturation. In contrast, fluorescence jumped only slightly upon mixing with the α3β3γε complex and a slow, large increase followed (Fig. 4, traceα3β3γε). In the case of the α3β3γδε complex, a slow, large increase followed after a small jump and a small bump of fluorescence (Fig. 4, trace α3β3γδε). The cause of a small jump and bump observed is not known at present, but it is obvious that most TNP-ATP bound to the (+ε) complexes slowly. For all measurements, further addition of excess ATP to the solutions with saturated fluorescence slowly reverted the intensity of fluorescence nearly down to the level of that in the absence of the complexes (data not shown). Slow fluorescence change by the binding of TNP-ATP to the (+ε) complexes observed in Fig. 4 is almost parallel to the slow hydrolysis of TNP-ATP in Fig. 3, indicating that the substrate binding is the rate-limiting step in the hydrolysis of substoichiometric TNP-ATP by the (+ε) complexes.Figure 4Time courses of TNP-ATP binding to the subunit complexes monitored by increase in fluorescence. Reactions were started by injection of subunit complex into the assay solution at the time indicated by an arrowhead. Final concentrations of the subunit complex and TNP-ATP were 0.47 and 0.15 μm, respectively. The fluorescent intensity at 548 nm was monitored.

Activation of μ-calpain requires calcium influx across the plasma membrane and the subsequent autoproteolytic conversion of the 80-kDa large subunit to a 78-kDa “intermediate” and a 76-kDa fully autolyzed form. Currently, there is limited information on the substrate specificities and functional roles of these distinct active forms of μ-calpain within the cell. Using antibodies that can distinguish among the 80-, 78-, and 76-kDa forms of μ-calpain, we have demonstrated a close correlation between the autolytic generation of the 78-kDa enzyme and the proteolysis of the non-receptor tyrosine phosphatase, PTP-1B, in ionophore A23187-stimulated platelets. Time course studies revealed that pp60c-src proteolysis lagged well behind that of PTP-1B and correlated closely with the generation of the fully proteolyzed form of μ-calpain (76 kDa). In vitroproteolysis experiments with purified μ-calpain and immunoprecipitated PTP-1B or pp60c-src confirmed selective proteolysis of pp60c-src by the 76-kDa enzyme, whereas PTP-1B cleavage was mediated by both the 76- and 78-kDa forms of μ-calpain. Studies using selective pharmacological inhibitors against the different autolytic forms of μ-calpain have demonstrated that the initial conversion of the μ-calpain large subunit to the 78-kDa form is responsible for the reduction in platelet-mediated clot retraction, whereas complete proteolytic activation of μ-calpain (76 kDa) is responsible for the shedding of procoagulant-rich membrane vesicles from the cell surface.

These studies demonstrate the existence of multiple active forms of μ-calpain within the cell, that have unique substrate specificities and distinct functional roles. Calpains comprise a family of calcium-dependent thiol proteases, that are widely expressed in mammalian cells (1Croall D.E. Demartino G.N. Physiol.

Sorimachi H. Suzuki K. FASEB J. 1994; 8: 814-822Crossref PubMed Scopus (617) Google Scholar). There are both tissue-specific and ubiquitous forms of calpain (3Saido T.C. Sorimachi H. Suzuki K. FASEB J. 1994; 8: 814-822Crossref PubMed Scopus (617) Google Scholar, 4Sorimachi H. Saido T.C. Suzuki K. FEBS Lett. 1994; 343: 1-5Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar), with μ-calpain and m-calpain representing the prototypic members of the latter group. These two enzymes are distinguishable by the concentration of calcium required for their activation in vitro, with μ-calpain requiring micromolar and m-calpain requiring millimolar concentrations of calcium for enzyme activation (3Saido T.C.

Both μ- and m-calpain have been identified in human platelets; however, μ-calpain is the predominant isoform in these cells, accounting for more than 90% of total platelet calpain activity (6Tsujinaka T. Shiba E. Kambayashi J. Kosaki G. Biochem. Int. 1983; 6: 71-80PubMed Google Scholar, 7Ariyoshi H. Kambayashi J. Sakon M. Platelets. 1995; 6: 185-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). μ- and m-calpains exist inside the cell as inactive proenzymes, composed of two non-identical subunits of approximately 30 and 80 kDa in molecular mass (1Croall D.E. Demartino G.N. Physiol. Rev. 1991; 71: 813-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (782) Google Scholar). The small subunits of μ- and m-calpain are identical, whereas the larger subunit is unique to each enzyme, suggesting that this subunit confers enzyme specificity (2Suzuki K. Saido T.C. Hirai S. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1992; 674: 218-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). A model for calpain activation has been proposed (8Suzuki K. Imajoh S. Emori Y. Kawasaki H. Minami Y. Ohno S. Adv. Enzyme Regul. 1988; 27: 153-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar), in which the enzyme translocates from the cytosol to the membrane in a calcium-dependent manner, bringing it into close proximity to membrane phospholipids (9Saido T.C. Shibata M. Takenawa T. Murofushi H. Suzuki K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 24585-24590Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Following translocation, the enzyme undergoes two N-terminal autoproteolytic events leading to the generation of 78- and 76-kDa active forms (8Suzuki K. Imajoh S. Emori Y. Kawasaki H. Minami Y.

The ability of calpain to proteolytically regulate various cytoskeletal structural proteins and signaling enzymes has suggested a potentially important role for this protease in modulating cytoskeletal reorganization and calcium-dependent signaling processes within the cell. Consistent with this are recent studies demonstrating that calpain proteolysis of non-receptor tyrosine kinases and phosphatases regulates the level of tyrosine phosphorylation in thrombin and ionophore A23187-stimulated platelets (7Ariyoshi H. Kambayashi J. Sakon M. Platelets. 1995; 6: 185-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the cleavage of cytoskeletal-associated structural proteins and signaling enzymes leads to the cytoskeletal detachment of integrin αIIbβ3 and relaxed fibrin clot retraction (23Schoenwaelder S.M.

In this report, we have investigated the substrate specificity and functional role(s) of the 78- and 76-kDa forms of μ-calpain in human platelets. The studies presented in this article demonstrate that the initial conversion of μ-calpain from the 80–78-kDa active form is required for PTP-1B cleavage and for the subsequent inhibitory effects of calpain on the clot retraction process. This is in contrast to pp60c-src proteolysis, which requires complete autolytic conversion of μ-calpain to the 76-kDa form and is associated with the shedding of procoagulant-rich microvesicles from the platelet surface. These studies suggest unique functional roles for the 78- and 76-kDa forms of μ-calpain in human platelets. Calpeptin was obtained from Biomol Research Laboratories, Plymouth Meeting, PA. E-64-d was obtained from the Peptide Institute, Inc., Osaka, Japan. E-64 and calpain inhibitor-I were obtained from Boehringer Mannheim. Ionophore A23187 and purified erythrocyte μ-calpain were from Calbiochem-Novabiochem Pty Ltd, New South Wales, Australia.

Anti-PTP-1B mAb was obtained from Transduction Laboratories, Lexington, KY. Anti-pp60c-src mAb 327 was a kind donation from Dr. Joan Brugge (University of Pennsylvania). Anti-GP IIb mAb SZ22 was purchased from Immunotech, France. Both anti-mouse and anti-rabbit peroxidase-conjugated IgG were from Silenus Laboratories, Victoria, Australia. Rabbit anti-mouse immunoglobulins were purchased from DAKO A/S, Glostrup, Denmark. Anti-calpain pre- (80 kDa) and post-autolytic (76 kDa) polyclonal antibodies were produced as described previously (32Saido T.C. Nagao S. Shiramine M. Tsukaguchi M. Sorimachi H. Muro-fushi H. Tsuchiya T. Ito H. Suzuki K. J. Biochem. ( Tokyo ). 1992; 111: 81-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar) (Fig.1 A). The autolytic intermediate form of the μ-calpain large subunit (78 kDa) was produced by incubating purified rabbit μ-calpain with 100 μm E-64 in the presence of 5 mm CaCl2, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, at 30 °C for 5 min. The presence of E-64 in these assays inhibits full μ-calpain autolysis, leading to the accumulation of the 78-kDa intermediate form. The cleavage site in μ-calpain to produce the autolytic intermediate was determined by directly sequencing the electrophoretically isolated fragment using a protein sequencer (Applied Biosystems model 492). Based on the information that the cleavage site is located between serine and alanine residues at positions 14 and 15 (see Fig.1 B), a synthetic peptide, AQVQKQC, was employed as a hapten to produce the antibody specific to the autolytic intermediate form. The haptenic peptide, conjugated to a keyhole limpet hemocyanin (Calbiochem), was used to immunize rabbits. The antibody was affinity-purified as described previously (32Saido T.C. Nagao S.

Human platelets were obtained from healthy volunteers, who had not taken anti-platelet medication in the preceding 2 weeks, and washed as described previously (31Jackson S.P. Schoenwaelder S.M. Yuan Y. Rabinowitz I. Salem H.H. Mitchell C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27093-27099Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Washed platelets were finally resuspended in modified Tyrode's buffer (10 mm Hepes, 12 mm NaHCO3, pH 7.5, 137 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, and 5 mm glucose), and preincubated with calpeptin (0.5–100 μg/ml), E-64-d (50–100 μm), or vehicle (0.3% Me2SO) for 30 min at room temperature prior to use. The Triton X-100-soluble fraction was prepared by lysing washed platelets with one volume of 10 × Triton X-100 lysis buffer (10% Triton X-100, 200 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 10 mm EGTA, 20 mm EDTA, 2 mm sodium vanadate, 250 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 50 μm calpain inhibitor-I) to nine volumes of platelets, and then gently agitated for 60 min at 4 °C. The Triton X-100-soluble fraction was prepared by centrifugation for 4 min at 15,000 × g, as described previously (33Zhang J. Fry M.J. Waterfield M.D. Jaken S. Liao L. Fox J.E.B. Rittenhouse S.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 4686-4692Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The supernatant containing the Triton X-100-soluble extract was removed and stored at −20 °C. Whole cell lysates were prepared by lysing activated platelets in Laemmli reducing buffer (0.125 m Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 5 mm EDTA, 20% glycerol, 4% SDS, 0.002% bromphenol blue, 10% β-mercaptoethanol) and were boiled immediately for 10 min. Equal quantities of platelet extracts (50 μg) were separated by 7.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, under reducing conditions, then transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. Western blots were performed as described by Towbin et al. (34Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44939) Google Scholar), using specific primary antibodies, followed by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies. Blots were developed using ECL according to the manufacturer's instructions (NEN Life Science Products). pp60c-src and PTP-1B were immunoprecipitated from the Triton X-100-soluble fraction of resting platelets, prepared as described above. 50 μl of a 50% slurry of Protein A was incubated with anti-PTP-1B polyclonal antibody (8 μg/ml) or anti-pp60c-src mAb 327 (10 μg/ml) in the presence of anti-mouse IgG (1 μg/ml), for 1 h at 4 °C. Excess antibody was removed by washing the Protein A beads three times with 20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl. 400 μg of total protein was added to the Protein A immune complex, and incubated for 2 h at 4 °C. Excess protein was removed by washing the Protein A beads three times with 20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, containing inhibitors (0.2 mmsodium vanadate, 25 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 μm calpain inhibitor-I). In vitro proteolysis studies were performed using a modified method from Baki et al. (13Baki A. Tompa P. Alexa A. Molnar O. Friedrich P. Biochem. J. 1996; 318: 897-901Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Purified erythrocyte μ-calpain (1 μg) was diluted in a buffer containing 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mmdithioerythritol, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 mm benzamidine. In some experiments, EDTA (5 mm) was included in the reaction mixture to prevent calpain activation. For studies using calpain inhibitors, purified calpain diluted in calpain buffer was preincubated with calpeptin (100 mg/ml) or E-64 (100 μm) for 30 min at room temperature. Calpain was activated by incubation with 1 mm CaCl2(final) at 37 °C for 1.5 min, in the presence of bovine serum albumin (1 mg/ml). Activated calpain was then added to Protein A beads containing immunoprecipitated pp60c-src or PTP-1B, and incubated for the indicated times at room temperature. Reactions were stopped by the addition of Laemmli reducing buffer containing 5 mm EDTA, and boiled for 10 min. Reaction mixtures were centrifuged and the supernatant analyzed for substrate cleavage by immunoblot analysis. The PTP-1B immunoblots were performed with a monoclonal antibody to avoid detection of the heavy chain of polyclonal anti-PTP-1B. Clot retraction studies were performed as described (23Schoenwaelder S.M. Yuan Y. Cooray P. Salem H.H. Jackson S.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1694-1702Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 30Schoenwaelder S.M. Jackson S.P. Yuan Y. Teasdale M.S. Salem H.H. Mitchell C.A. J. Biol.

Washed platelets were pretreated with calpeptin (100 μg/ml), E-64-d (100 μm), or vehicle (0.3% Me2SO) for 30 min, prior to activation with thrombin (1 unit/ml) or ionophore A23187 (0.25–1 μm). For studies with ionophore A23187 alone, atroxin (0.1 μg/ml) was added to induce clot formation. In all studies with ionophore A23187, the platelets were left unstirred during the assay. When thrombin was used as the agonist, platelets were stirred for a maximum time period of 45–60 s. Clot retraction was assessed after 60 min of platelet activation. The extent of clot retraction was quantitated by measuring the residual volume of serum (after removal of the fibrin clot) and expressing this as a percentage of the total reaction volume. Platelet microvesicles were isolated from platelets according to the method described by Foxet al. (25Fox J.E.B. Austin C.D. Reynolds C.C. Steffen P.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 13289-13295Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Washed platelets were pretreated with calpeptin (100 μg/ml), E-64-d (100 μm), or vehicle (0.3% Me2SO) for 30 min, prior to platelet activation. Platelets were treated with thrombin (1 unit/ml) (stirred), ionophore A23187 (0.25–1 μm) (unstirred), or buffer alone, in the presence of 1 mm calcium or 1 mm EGTA and 2 mm MgCl2, for the indicated time points, prior to the addition of 5 mm EGTA and 10 mmtheophylline. The reaction mixture was centrifuged at 15,600 ×g for 1′ at room temperature. The platelet pellet was lysed in Laemmli reducing buffer and boiled for 10 min. The supernatant containing platelet microvesicles was centrifuged at 100,000 ×g for 2.5 h, and the resultant microvesicle pellet solubilized in Laemmli reducing buffer and boiled for 10 min. Microvesicles were detected by immunoblotting the 100,000 ×g pellet with an anti-GP IIb antibody. pp60c-src proteolysis was analyzed by immunoblotting the 15,600 × g platelet pellet with an anti-pp60c-src antibody. SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was performed according to the method of Laemmli (35Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar). Fibrinogen was purified from fresh frozen plasma as described previously by Jakobsen and Koerulf (36Jakobsen E. Koerulf P. Thromb. Res. 1979; 3: 145-159Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were measured using the Bio-Rad protein assay with bovine serum albumin as a standard. Activation of the thiol protease, calpain, is one of the many calcium-dependent signaling events that occur as a consequence of platelet activation. Calpain activation is associated with significant autoproteolytic modification of the N termini of the 80-kDa catalytic and 30-kDa regulatory subunits (2Suzuki K. Saido T.C. Hirai S. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1992; 674: 218-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). In vitro proteolysis experiments have revealed that the conversion of both subunits to their fully autolyzed forms proceeds sequentially through the generation of a number of intermediate-sized proteins. For example, the 80-kDa subunit is initially converted to a 78-kDa “intermediate” protein, which is further proteolyzed to the 76-kDa fully autolyzed form (Fig. 1 A) (12Inomata M. Kasai Y. Nakamura M. Kawashima S. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 19783-19787Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 37Hayashi M. Inomata M. Saito Y. Ito H. Kawashima S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1094: 249-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). We have previously raised anti-peptide polyclonal antibodies against the unique N-terminal sequences of the 80-kDa (anti-pre-μ) and 76-kDa (anti-post-μ) large subunits of calpain (32Saido T.C. Nagao S. Shiramine M. Tsukaguchi M. Sorimachi H. Muro-fushi H. Tsuchiya T. Ito H. Suzuki K. J. Biochem. ( Tokyo ). 1992; 111: 81-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Using a similar strategy, we have raised an antibody against the N terminus of the 78-kDa (anti-inter-μ) intermediate calpain (Fig. 1 B), as described under “Experimental Procedures,” and compared its antigenic specificity against the anti-pre- and anti-post-μ-calpain antibodies. In initial studies, the extent of calpain activation (following the addition of calcium to purified rabbit μ-calpain) was examined using a polyclonal antibody that recognizes all forms of μ-calpain (anti-domain III antibody). In the absence of calcium, only the inactive form of μ-calpain (80 kDa) was detected (Fig.1 C, Anti-domain III, lane 1). With the addition of calcium, full μ-calpain autolysis was observed as demonstrated by the presence of a single protein band with increased electrophoretic mobility (76 kDa) (Fig. 1 C,Anti-domain III, lane 2). Pretreating purified μ-calpain with the calpain inhibitor, E-64 (100 μm), prior to the addition of calcium, inhibited full μ-calpain autolysis leading to the accumulation of both the intermediate (78 kDa) and inactive (80 kDa) forms (Fig. 1 C, Anti-domain III, lane 3). Immunoblot analysis of these different μ-calpain forms with each of the anti-peptide antibodies revealed that anti-pre-μ selectively recognized 80-kDa calpain (Fig.1 C, Anti-pre-μ, lanes 1 and3), anti-inter-μ specifically recognized 78-kDa μ-calpain (Fig. 1 C, Anti-inter-μ, lane 3), and anti-post-μ only recognized the fully autolyzed form of the protease (76 kDa) (Fig. 1 C, Anti-post-μ,lane 2). We have demonstrated previously that immunoblot analysis of whole cell lysates with the anti-pre-μ and anti-post-μ antibodies represents a sensitive, specific and direct means of monitoring μ-calpain activation within the cell (32Saido T.C. Nagao S. Shiramine M. Tsukaguchi M. Sorimachi H. Muro-fushi H. Tsuchiya T. Ito H. Suzuki K. J. Biochem. ( Tokyo ). 1992; 111: 81-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Using the anti-peptide antibody, anti-inter-μ, we examined the time course for the generation of the 78-kDa form of μ-calpain in ionophore A23187-stimulated platelets. In resting platelets, only the inactive form of μ-calpain was present, as demonstrated by the intact 80-kDa large subunit (Fig. 2). Following treatment with ionophore A23187, the level of the intact 80-kDa subunit decreased in a time-dependent fashion and was no longer present in whole cell lysates after 1 min of platelet activation. The disappearance of the 80-kDa subunit correlated with an increase in the 78-kDa intermediate enzyme, which was apparent within 15–30 s of platelet activation. Beyond 1 min of platelet activation the levels of the 78-kDa enzyme decreased, correlating with the appearance of the fully autolyzed μ-calpain (76 kDa) (Fig. 2). These studies confirm the sequential generation of the 78- and 76-kDa forms of μ-calpain in activated platelets. We have noted previously that the time course for PTP-1B and pp125FAK cleavage in ionophore A23187-stimulated platelets was considerably more rapid than that of pp60c-src(21Cooray P. Yuan Y. Schoenwaelder S.M. Mitchell C.A. Salem H.H. Jackson S.P. Biochem. J. 1996; 318: 41-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). There are a number of factors that may influence the rate of substrate proteolysis in vivo, including differences in substrate susceptibility to proteolysis, proteolysis by distinct forms of calpain, or compartmentalization factors within the cell that may limit substrate accessibility to the protease. It is also possible that the endogenous inhibitor of calpain, calpastatin, may preferentially modulate the proteolysis of specific calpain substrates. We investigated the possibility that the different forms of active μ-calpain (78 and 76 kDa) may cleave distinct substrates. In our initial studies, we compared the time course for pp60c-src and PTP-1B proteolysis in ionophore A23187-stimulated platelets with the generation of the 78- and 76-kDa forms of μ-calpain. As demonstrated in Fig. 2, the time course for PTP-1B proteolysis correlated closely with the generation of the 78-kDa form of μ-calpain. This was in direct contrast to pp60c-src cleavage, which lagged well behind that of PTP-1B (Fig. 2) and correlated with the appearance of the fully autolyzed 76-kDa form of μ-calpain. We examined in further detail the relationship between the generation of the different forms of active μ-calpain and the cleavage of PTP-1B and pp60c-src by pretreating platelets with increasing concentrations of the membrane-permeable calpain inhibitor, calpeptin, prior to ionophore A23187 stimulation. We have previously demonstrated under these same experimental conditions that calpeptin pretreatment of platelets inhibits calpain activation in a dose-dependent manner (23Schoenwaelder S.M. Yuan Y. Cooray P. Salem H.H. Jackson S.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1694-1702Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). As demonstrated in Fig.3, doses of calpeptin (0.5–2.0 μg/ml) which effectively blocked the generation of the 76-kDa form of calpain also blocked pp60c-src proteolysis, but had minimal effect on PTP-1B cleavage. In contrast, higher concentrations of calpeptin (5.0–20 μg/ml) were required to inhibit the generation of the 78-kDa form of calpain and PTP-1B cleavage (Fig. 3). We consistently noted in these experiments an excellent dose-dependent relationship between the amount of 78-kDa calpain generated and the degree of PTP-1B proteolysis. Taken together, these studies suggest that differences in the rates of substrate proteolysis in vivo may be due, at least in part, to differences in the rate of generation of distinct forms of active μ-calpain. Previous in vitro proteolysis experiments comparing the catalytic properties of the fully autolyzed forms of μ- and m-calpain have reported no major differences in the substrate specificity of these enzymes (1Croall D.E. Demartino G.N. Physiol. Rev. 1991; 71: 813-847Crossref PubMed S"

However, it is not known to which glycosidase family it belongs, nor is the identity of the active site nucleophile known with certainty. It can be inactivated using the specific, mechanism-based enzyme inactivator 2-deoxy-2-fluoro-β-d-glucopyranosyl fluoride, which functions by forming a stable 2-deoxy-2-fluoro-α-d-glucopyranosyl-enzyme intermediate. The glycosylated peptide present in a peptic digest of this trapped glycosyl-enzyme intermediate was identified by use of neutral loss scans on an electrospray ionization triple quadrupole mass spectrometer. Comparative liquid chromatographic/mass spectrometric analysis of peptic digests of labeled and unlabeled enzyme samples confirmed the unique presence of this peptide of m/z = 1041 in the labeled sample. The sequence of this peptide was determined to be Ile-Thr-Glu-Gln-Gly-Val-Asp-Glu by further tandem mass spectrometric analysis in the daughter ion scan mode in conjunction with Edman degradation of the purified peptide. The identity of the labeled side chain was determined by further tandem mass spectrometric analysis in the daughter ion scan mode of a partially purified sample of the labeled peptide subjected to methyl esterification, the fragmentation pattern being consistent only with the first Glu in the sequence being labeled. The sequence around this residue is identical to that surrounding the catalytic nucleophile in many members of glycosidase Family 1, confirming the assignment of this enzyme to that family. The residue labeled is, however, different from that (Asp) identified previously in the enzyme from bitter almonds by use of conduritol epoxide affinity labels, although apparently close in the primary sequence.

The β-glucosidase from almonds has probably been the subject of more kinetic studies than any other glucosidase. This is a consequence not only of its long history, the enzyme being easily isolated in large quantities from a readily available material, and its commercial availability, but also the simplicity of its assay using aryl glycosides in particular. The enzyme is known to exist in a number of isoenzymic forms, which can cause some difficulties in the interpretation of kinetic studies. However, these isozymes have been separated in some cases (1Grover A.K. MacMurchie D.D. Cushley R.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1977; 482: 98-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 2Weber J.P.

Therefore, it presumably follows the standard mechanism of such retaining glycosidases, in which the substrate binds to an active site containing a pair of carboxylic acids (4McCarter J. Withers S.G. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1994; 4: 885-892Crossref PubMed Scopus (811) Google Scholar, 5Sinnott M.L. Chem. Rev. 1990; 90: 1171-1202Crossref Scopus (1492) Google Scholar). In a first step termed the glycosylation step, the glycoside is protonated by one of these acids (the acid/base catalyst) while undergoing attack at the anomeric center by the other, resulting in the formation of a covalent glycosyl-enzyme intermediate. This covalent intermediate is then hydrolyzed in a second step (the deglycosylation step) by general base-catalyzed attack of water at the anomeric center. Both steps proceed via transition states with substantial oxocarbenium ion character. Evidence in support of this mechanism has come from a number of studies, most notably from the biphasic, downward curving Hammett relationship observed between the kinetic parameters for hydrolysis of a series of aryl glycosides and the phenol leaving group ability (4McCarter J. Withers S.G. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1994; 4: 885-892Crossref PubMed Scopus (811) Google Scholar, 5Sinnott M.L. Chem. Rev. 1990; 90: 1171-1202Crossref Scopus (1492) Google Scholar). This clearly indicates a two-step mechanism. Evidence for the oxocarbenium ion-like transition state also arises from the impressive inhibition afforded by transition state analogue inhibitors such as gluconolactone (6Legler G. Adv. Carbohydr. Chem. Biochem. 1990; 48: 319-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (645) Google Scholar), as well as numerous measurements of secondary deuterium kinetic isotope effects (4McCarter J. Withers S.G. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1994; 4: 885-892Crossref PubMed Scopus (811) Google Scholar, 5Sinnott M.L. Chem. Rev. 1990; 90: 1171-1202Crossref Scopus (1492) Google Scholar). This enzyme has also been the subject of a number of studies with irreversible inactivators. Thus, β-d-glucosylisothiocyanates were tested early on as inactivators of this enzyme, presumably functioning via affinity labeling of nucleophilic active site residues (7Shulman M.L. Shiyan S.D. Khorlin A.Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1976; 445: 169-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The most useful insight has come from important, early studies by Legler using conduritol epoxides as active site-directed affinity labels (8Legler G. Hoppe-Seyler's Z. Physiol. Chem. 1970; 351: 25-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). These reagents are polyhydroxylated cyclohexanes containing a reactive epoxide functionality. Because they mimic a simple glycoside, they presumably bind at the active site, then become activated by protonation of the epoxide, and suffer attack by a suitably disposed enzymic nucleophile. In a series of careful studies on sweet almond enzymes A and B, Legler showed stoicheometries of binding of 1.7 and 1.0 for isozymes A and B, respectively, according to different kinetic parameters. He also showed that the stereochemistry of the cyclitol product released upon cleavage of the cyclitol peptide ester with hydroxylamine was consistent with trans-diaxial opening of the epoxide moiety. Similar results were obtained with the enzyme from bitter almonds. In addition, in that case, he was able to isolate and sequence the derivatized peptide by use of radioactive labels (9Legler G. Harder A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1978; 524: 102-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). In this way, he identified a labeled aspartate residue, and quite reasonably assigned this the role of active site nucleophile. Unfortunately, it has been established recently (10Gebler J.C. Aebersold R. Withers S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 11126-11130Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11Miao S. McCarter J.D. Grace M.E. Grabowski G.A. Aebersold R. Withers S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10975-10978Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Withers S.G. Aebersold R. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 361-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar) that, although these conduritol epoxides do indeed label active site residues, in a number of cases the residue labeled has not actually been the catalytic nucleophile, but some other carboxylic acid. In at least one case, the residue labeled was subsequently shown to be the acid/base catalyst (10Gebler J.C. Aebersold R. Withers S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 11126-11130Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, this is not always the case, as has been shown recently (13Febbraio F. Barone R. D'Auria S. Rossi M. Nucci R. Picciali G. De Napoli L. Orru S. Pucci P. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 3068-3075Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). It was therefore necessary to re-investigate the identity of the active site nucleophile in sweet almond β-glucosidase. An additional benefit of such a study might be the assignment of the enzyme to one of the sequence-related families of glycosidases delineated by Henrissat (14Henrissat B. Biochem. J. 1991; 280: 309-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (2624) Google Scholar, 15Henrissat B. Bairoch A. Biochem. J. 1996; 316: 695-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (1187) Google Scholar, 16Henrissat B. Bairoch A. Biochem. J. 1993; 293: 781-788Crossref PubMed Scopus (1771) Google Scholar), inasmuch as sequences around the active site nucleophile are typically highly conserved and unique for the family. The reagents that have made the unequivocal identification of the active site nucleophiles in retaining glycosidases possible are the 2-deoxy-2-fluoro glycosides with activated leaving groups, most commonly the 2,4-dinitrophenyl glycoside, or the glycosyl fluoride (12Withers S.G. Aebersold R. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 361-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar,17Withers S.G. Street I.P. Bird P. Dolphin D.H. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1987; 109: 7530-7531Crossref Scopus (138) Google Scholar), which function by forming stabilized glycosyl-enzyme intermediates. The fluorine at the 2-position destabilizes the oxocarbenium ion-like transition states for formation and hydrolysis of the intermediate, while the presence of a good leaving group ensures that the formation of the intermediate is faster than hydrolysis. The trapping of the covalent intermediate in a β-glucosidase and a cellulase has been verified by 19F NMR (18Withers S.G. Street I.P. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1988; 110: 8551-8553Crossref Scopus (123) Google Scholar) and even by x-ray crystallography (19White A. Tull D. Johns K. Gilkes N.R. Withers S.G. Rose D.R. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 149-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Identification of the catalytic nucleophile is then made possible by proteolytic digestion of the labeled enzyme, followed by HPLC 1The abbreviations used are: HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography; 2FβGlcF, 2-deoxy-2-fluoro-β-d-glucopyranosyl fluoride; PNPGlc,p-nitrophenyl-β-d-glucopyranoside; LC, liquid chromatography; MS, mass spectrometry; PIPES, piperazineethanesulfonic acid; ISV, ion source voltage; OR, orifice energy. separation of the resultant peptides and localization of the labeled peptide. This can be achieved either by use of a radiolabeled inactivator, or preferably by use of electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry to detect specific fragmentations associated with such a glycosylated peptide (11Miao S.

The active site nucleophiles of a number of glycosidases have now been identified by these means (12Withers S.G. Aebersold R. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 361-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar, 21Mackenzie L.F. Davies G.J. Schulein M. Withers S.G.

This article describes the application of these techniques to the identification of the active site nucleophile in sweet almond β-glucosidase. Sweet almond β-glucosidase (type 1), PNPGlc, all buffer chemicals, and other reagents were obtained from Sigma unless otherwise noted. Pepsin (from porcine gastric mucosa) was obtained from Boehringer Mannheim. The synthesis of the inactivator 2-deoxy-2-fluoro-β-glucosyl fluoride was carried out according to published protocols (23Street I.P. Armstrong C.R. Withers S.G. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 6021-6027Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar, 24Hall L.D. Johnson R.N. Adamson J.B. Foster A.B. Can. J. Chem. 1971; 49: 118-126Crossref Google Scholar, 25Adamson J. Foster A.B. Hall L.D. Johnson R.N. Hesse R.M. Carbohydr. Res. 1970; 15: 351-359Crossref Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Kinetic studies were performed at 25 °C at pH 5.6 in a buffer system containing 20 mm sodium acetate, 10 mm PIPES, 0.1 mm EDTA, and 0.1% bovine serum albumin. A continuous spectrophotometric assay based on the hydrolysis of PNPGlc was used to monitor enzyme activity by measurement of the rate of 4-nitrophenolate release (λ = 400 nm, ε = 7.28 × 103m−1cm−1 in the buffer above) using a PU-8800 UV-visible spectrophotometer equipped with a circulating water bath. The inactivation of β-glucosidase by 2FβGlcF was monitored by incubation of the enzyme (∼0.04 mg·ml−1) under the above conditions in the presence of various concentrations of the inactivator. Residual enzyme activity was determined at appropriate time intervals by addition of an aliquot (5 or 10 μl) of the inactivation mixture to a solution of PNPGlc (1 mm, 600 μl) in the above buffer, and measurement of nitrophenolate release. Dialyzed β-glucosidase (25 μl, 10 mg/ml, in 50 mm phosphate, pH 6.8, buffer), was incubated with 2FβGlcF (5 μl, 52 mm) at 37 °C for 1 h. Complete inactivation was confirmed by enzyme assay. β-Glucosidase (30 μl, native or 5FβGlc-labeled, 10 mg/ml) was mixed with 50 mm phosphate buffer, pH 2 (60 μl), and pepsin (30 μl, 1 mg/ml in 50 mm, pH 2, phosphate buffer). The mixture was incubated at room temperature for 15 min, then frozen and analyzed immediately by LC/MS upon thawing. Mass spectra were recorded on a PE-Sciex API 300 triple quadrupole mass spectrometer (Sciex, Thornhill, Ontario, Canada) equipped with an Ionspray ion source. Peptides were separated by reverse phase HPLC on an Ultrafast Microprotein Analyzer (Michrom BioResources Inc., Pleasanton, CA) directly interfaced with the mass spectrometer. In each of the MS experiments, the proteolytic digest was loaded onto a C18 column (Reliasil, 1 × 150 mm), then eluted with a gradient of 0–60% solvent B over 60 min, followed by 100% B over 2 min at a flow rate of 50 μl/min (solvent A: 0.05% trifluoroacetic acid, 2% acetonitrile in water; solvent B: 0.045% trifluoroacetic acid, 80% acetonitrile in water). Spectra were obtained in either the single-quadrupole scan mode (LC/MS), the tandem MS neutral loss scan mode, or the tandem MS product ion scan mode (LC/MS/MS). In the single quadrupole mode (LC/MS), the quadrupole mass analyzer was scanned over a m/z range of 300–2400 Da with a step size of 0.5 Da and a dwell time of 1 ms/step. The ion source voltage (ISV) was set at 5 kV, and the orifice energy (OR) was 50 V. In the neutral loss scanning mode, MS/MS spectra were obtained by searching for the mass loss of m/z 165, corresponding to the loss of the 2FGlc label from a peptide ion in the singly charged state. Thus, scan range: m/z 300–2400; step size: 0.5; dwell time: 1 ms; ion source voltage (ISV): 5 kV; OR: 45; Q0 = −10; IQ2 = −49. To maximize the sensitivity of neutral loss detection, normally the resolution is compromised without generating artifact neutral loss peaks. In the tandem MS product ion scan mode, the spectrum was obtained by selectively introducing the precursor ion (m/z = 1041 or 1083) from the first quadrupole (Q1) into the collision cell (Q2) and observing the product ions in the third quadrupole (Q3). Thus, Q1 was locked on m/z 1041 or 1083; Q3 scan range: 50–1060 or 1100; step size: 0.3; dwell time: 2 ms; ISV: 5 kV; OR: 50; Q0 = −10; IQ2 = −49. Partially purified peptide (control or labeled) was mixed with a freshly prepared solution of 2 m methanolic HCl. The mixture was incubated at room temperature for 30 min. The excess reagent was removed by centrifugation under vacuum, and then the esterified product was dissolved in 50% methanol with 5% acetic acid. Inactivation of the sweet almond β-glucosidase by 2FβGlcF occurred according to a relatively complex kinetic pattern as shown in Fig. 1. Inactivation proceeded to completion, but did not follow a simple first order process. The most likely reason for this complex kinetic behavior is the presence of at least two isozymes with different kinetic parameters within the enzyme sample, as has been reported previously (1Grover A.K. MacMurchie D.D. Cushley R.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1977; 482: 98-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 2Weber J.P. Fink A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 9030-9032Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Because the amino acid sequences at the active sites of these two isozymes are likely identical, given the highly conserved nature of active sites within families, it seemed probable that a single, labeled peptide would be obtained upon proteolytic digestion of the inactivated isozyme mixture, avoiding the need to separate the two isozymes. Peptic digestion was chosen, given the known lability of esters at pH values above 6 and given the stabilization toward tryptic digestion at neutral pH afforded by the trapped intermediate. Use of pepsin also has the advantage of producing short peptides, thereby minimizing the probability of sequence differences between the two isozymes within that region. A peptic digest of the labeled enzyme was subjected to purification by microbore reverse phase HPLC, with monitoring of the eluent by on-line electrospray ionization mass spectrometry. The chromatogram obtained is shown in Fig. 2 a. The location of the labeled peptide within this chromatogram was determined by means of a neutral loss scan in the tandem mass spectrometer (11Miao S. McCarter J.D. Grace M.E. Grabowski G.A. Aebersold R. Withers S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10975-10978Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Withers S.G. Aebersold R. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 361-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). In this mode, the peptide ions are eluted into the tandem mass spectrometer and subjected to collision assisted dissociation in the collision cell of the instrument. The ester bond between the sugar and the peptide is one of the more labile linkages present, and under these conditions the fluorosugar is cleaved off as a neutral species, leaving the peptide with its original charge. The two quadrupoles are therefore scanned in a linked mode, so that only those ions which decrease in mass by the mass of the lost label after passage through the collision cell can be detected. For a singly charged peptide, this m/zdifference is the mass of the label (m/z = 165). Scanning in the neutral loss mode for the mass loss 165 from a singly charged peptide revealed one major peak (Fig. 2 b) in the 2FGlc-labeled digest that was absent in an unlabeled, control digest (Fig. 2 c). This clearly indicates that the peptide eluting at 23.1 min of m/z = 1041 (Fig. 2 d) is the peptide of interest. The unlabeled peptide must therefore have a mass of 876 (1041–165) and therefore contains approximately 7–9 amino acid residues. LC/MS analysis of the control digest reveals a peptide of this same mass (876) eluting at 23.2 min, whereas no peptide of this mass is observed in the peptic digest of the labeled enzyme, nor is a peptide of mass 1041 found in peptic digests of the unlabeled protein. These results clearly indicate that this is indeed the peptide of interest. The amino acid sequence of this labeled peptide was determined using a combination of Edman degradation of the purified peptide and tandem mass spectrometric fragmentation analysis. The peptide was purified by collecting the sample eluting around 23 min, then subjecting this to further HPLC purification as outlined under “Experimental Procedures.” Edman degradation of the sample succeeded in identifying the first 4 residues of the peptide as Ile-Thr-Xaa-Asn; unfortunately, no conclusive sequence information beyond that point was obtained. The peptide was then subjected to sequence analysis by tandem mass spectrometry. A sample of the partially purified peptide of mass 1041 obtained from the peptic digest of the labeled enzyme was infused into the mass spectrometer and this peptide selected in the first quadrupole, subjected to fragmentation at an increased collision gas energy, and the masses of the fragments so derived measured by scanning the third quadrupole. The results of this analysis are shown in Fig.3. The parent, labeled peptide (m/z = 1041) and peptide that has lost sugar (m/z = 876) are easily seen along with many other fragments. These were analyzed as is shown in Fig. 3 to yield the sequence Ile-Thr-Glu-Asn-Gly-Val-Asp-Glu, consistent with the mass of 876 for the unlabeled peptide, as shown. The N-terminal portion of this sequence could not easily be obtained a priori from this fragmentation pattern, but fortunately the Edman analysis was clear in this region. The presence of three side chain carboxylic acids plus the C-terminal carboxylic acid group was confirmed by subjecting the peptide to acid-catalyzed methyl esterification in methanol, followed by mass analysis. The mass measured for this esterified peptide (932) is 56 Da greater than that of the parent peptide, consistent with the formation of four methyl esters. Equivalent treatment of the purified labeled peptide resulted in two new peptides, one of mass 1083 corresponding to the addition of three methyl esters and one of mass 932, which arises from trans-esterification at the position of labeling in addition to ester formation at the other three positions. This confirms the attachment of the label to one of the carboxylic acids. The identity of the labeled amino acid within this peptide was determined by MS/MS analysis of the methylated glycopeptide (m/z = 1083). As shown in Fig.4, loss of the neutral sugar moiety occurs readily yielding a peptide of m/z 918. Further fragmentation revealed that both the C-terminal glutamic acid and the penultimate aspartic acid were present as their methyl esters, as revealed by loss of 175 (Glu = 147 + 2 × methyl ester = 28) and 129 (Asp = 115 + methyl ester = 14), leaving fragments of 743 and 614. Observation of such fragmentations requires that the glutamic acid residue near the N-terminal end of the peptide, within the sequence Ile-Thr-Glu-Asn-Gly, is the site of labeling. This sequence is identical to that found around the active site nucleophile in the Family 1 β-glucosidase from Agrobacterium faecalis, and highly conserved within that family (26Withers S.G. Warren R.A.J. Street I.P. Rupitz K. Kempton J.B. Aebersold R. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1990; 112: 5887-5889Crossref Scopus (207) Google Scholar). This indicates that the sweet almond β-glucosidase belongs to Family 1, a finding consistent with the presence of a number of other plant β-glucosidases within this family. It is also consistent with the fact that many of the enzymes within this family have both β-glucosidase and β-galactosidase activity, as also does the sweet almond enzyme (1Grover A.K. MacMurchie D.D. Cushley R.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1977; 482: 98-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 27Dale M.P. Ensley H.E. Kern K. Sastry K.A.R. Byers L.D.

Interestingly this same sequence (Ile-Thr-Glu-Gln-Gly) is contained within the N-terminal end of the sequence originally identified in the conduritol epoxide-labeled bitter almond enzyme (9Legler G. Harder A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1978; 524: 102-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), the complete sequence being Ile-Thr-Glx-Glx-Gly-Val-Phe-Gly-Asp-Ser-Glx-(Ala-Asx2-Pro)-Lys. The conduritol label was found to be attached to the underlined Asp. This would indicate that, not surprisingly, the bitter almond enzyme is also a member of Family 1. The three-dimensional structure of the clover β-glucosidase, a Family 1 enzyme, has been determined recently (29Barrett T. Suresh C.G. Tolley S.P. Dodson E.J. Hughes M.A. Structure. 1995; 3: 951-960Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). The sequence of the bitter almond β-glucosidase peptide was aligned with the sequence of the clover β-glucosidase and the available, three-dimensional structure inspected for the location of the residue labeled by the conduritol epoxide. The labeled Asp was found some 10 Å away from the active site nucleophile on the entrance to the tunnel leading into the active site. Thus, it appears either that the conduritol epoxide binds to and tags a subsite or that, after protonation in the active site, the epoxide diffuses outward and reacts with the Asp residue. This, therefore, provides another example of the nonspecificity of labeling with conduritol epoxides and provides some insight into how this occurs. On the basis of the sequence of the peptide derived from a trapped glycosyl-enzyme intermediate, the sweet almond β-glucosidase is assigned to glycosidase Family 1, with its active site nucleophile contained within the sequence Ile-Thr-Glu-Asn-Gly. Prior observation (9Legler G. Harder A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1978; 524: 102-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) of an identical sequence within a labeled peptide from the bitter almond β-glucosidase similarly assigns that enzyme to Family 1."

Based on the analysis of yeast strains lacking the p24 members Emp24p and/or Erv25p, it was suggested that p24 proteins might be involved in the packaging of cargo molecules into vesicles as well as vesicle budding (13Stamnes M.A. Craighead M.W. Hoe M.H. Lampen N. Geromanos S. Tempst P. Rothman J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8011-8015Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar, 14Schimmoller F. Singer-Kruger B. Schroder S.

Furthermore, yeast strains lacking Emp24p were found to be defective in the retention of ER-resident proteins (21Elrod-Erickson M.J. Kaiser C.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 1043-1058Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar) consistent with a role of p24 proteins in controlling the fidelity of cargo recruitment into budding vesicles. We have previously shown that conserved phenylalanine residues in the cytoplasmic domain of p24 proteins mediate the interaction with coatomer and are likely to be involved in anterograde trafficking of p24s from the ER through the Golgi complex (12Sohn K. Orci L. Ravazzola M. Amherdt M. Bremser M. Lottspeich F. Fiedler K. Helms J.B. Wieland F.T. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 1239-1248Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar, 20Fiedler K. Veit M. Stamnes M.A. Rothman J.E. Science. 1996; 273: 1396-1399Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). As a first step toward the identification of additional components of the vesicle budding machinery we have further characterized the transport signals of p24 proteins. A charged amino acid in the p24 TMD appears to serve as a retention signal that is modulated by other TMD residues and phenylalanines in the cytoplasmic domain. The OKT8 CD8 monoclonal antibody was obtained from Ortho Diagnostic Systems (Raritan, NJ), the goat anti-mouse fluorescein-conjugated secondary antibody from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR), and Lipofectin and LipofectAMINETM from Life Technologies, Inc. COS7 (SV40-transformed African green monkey kidney) cells were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection (Rockville, MD), protein G-agarose from Boehringer Mannheim, and [35S]methionine/cysteine from ICN. The CD8 chimera were constructed by the polymerase chain reaction such that the 165-amino acids of the human CD8 extracellular domain were preserved (20Fiedler K. Veit M. Stamnes M.A. Rothman J.E. Science. 1996; 273: 1396-1399Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). Codon 166 was changed to glycine to introduce a unique ApaI restriction site, followed by a conserved proline, a stop codon, and aEcoRI site (CD8-C1). Oligonucleotides (Gene Link, Thornwood, NY) coding for the COOH-terminal 34 amino acids of chop24a (RVVLWSFFEALVLVAMTLGQIYYLKRFFEVRRVV) and variants thereof (see Fig. 1 B), preceded by an ApaI site and followed by a stop codon and EcoRI site, were annealed, subcloned into the CD8 construct, and inserted into the pECE vector (22Ellis L. Clauser E. Morgan D.O. Edery M. Roth R.A. Rutter W.J. Cell. 1986; 45: 721-732Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (697) Google Scholar). Sequences were verified by DNA sequencing using the Sequenase DNA sequencing kit (U. S. Biochemical Corp.). Transfection of COS7 cells was carried out with Lipofectin and LipofectAMINE for immunofluorescence and pulse-chase analysis, respectively, according to the manufacturer's instructions. The chimeras were analyzed 46 h after transfection. For localization by immunofluorescence, the cells were incubated in medium containing 10 μg/ml cycloheximide for 2 h prior to fixation. They were permeabilized with Triton X-100 before labeling with the OKT8 CD8 monoclonal antibody (dilution of 1/50) and goat anti-mouse fluorescein-conjugated secondary antibody (dilution of 1/200) as described (17Fiedler K. Parton R.G. Kellner R. Etzold T. Simons K. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1729-1740Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar) and viewed and photographed with an Axiophot photomicroscope (Carl Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany). For pulse-chase analysis COS7 cells were labeled for 20 min with [35S]methionine/cysteine and then incubated for 0, 15, 30, 45, 60, and 120 min in medium containing unlabeled methionine/cysteine. The cells were lysed in Triton X-100, and the CD8 chimeras were isolated by immunoprecipitation (23Jackson M.R. Nilsson T. Peterson P.A. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 121: 317-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar) with protein G-agarose before SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (12% gel) (24Hara-Kuge S. Kuge O. Orci L. Amherdt M.

The alignment of p24 TMDs and cytoplasmic tails showed that in addition to one absolutely conserved phenylalanine in the cytoplasmic domain (position 195 in chop24a, the p24 protein isolated from CHO cells (13Stamnes M.A. Craighead M.W. Hoe M.H. Lampen N. Geromanos S. Tempst P. Rothman J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8011-8015Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar)), other amino acids in the TMD are conserved. First, a glutamine residue is present in the TMDs adjacent to the TMD-cytoplasmic domain border in all p24s (position 187 in chop24a). Second, a position juxtaposed to the exoplasmic domain (position 176 in chop24a) accommodates a glutamic acid or polar residue in most p24 proteins with only some exceptions in yeast (Fig. 1 A). In a helical wheel presentation, the TMD glutamic acid and glutamine (but not the strictly conserved phenylalanine in the cytoplasmic domain) line the same side of the predicted α-helical structure (data not shown), revealing a relatively nonhydrophobic face in the TMD of p24 proteins. To analyze the role of the conserved residues on p24 localization and trafficking, CD8 chimeras were generated in which the CD8 TMD and cytoplasmic domain were replaced with the corresponding wild-type and mutant sequences of chop24a (Fig. 1 B) (13Stamnes M.A. Craighead M.W. Hoe M.H. Lampen N. Geromanos S. Tempst P. Rothman J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8011-8015Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). The CD8 protein has been used previously to analyze cytoplasmic domain and TMD trafficking signals (25Nilsson T.M. Jackson M.R. Peterson P.A. Cell. 1989; 58: 707-718Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar, 26Jackson M.R. Nilsson T. Peterson P.A. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 3153-3162Crossref PubMed Scopus (728) Google Scholar, 27Ponnambalam S. Rabouille C. Luzio J.P. Nilsson T. Warren G. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 125: 253-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). CD8-chop24a chimeras were localized by immunofluorescence in transiently expressing COS7 cells (Fig.2). When the glutamic acid residue alone (EA, panel A), in combination with the conserved glutamine (EA-QA, panel C) or phenylalanines (EA-FFAA, panel E), or all three positions (EA-QA-FFAA, panel F) were replaced with alanine, the hybrid proteins were predominantly detected at the cell surface and in a juxtanuclear area, just as the wild-type chimera had been localized (cf. the previous analysis (20Fiedler K. Veit M. Stamnes M.A. Rothman J.E. Science. 1996; 273: 1396-1399Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar) and panel G). In contrast, when the glutamine residue alone (QA,panel B) or in combination with the phenylalanines (QA-FFAA, panel D) was replaced with alanine, the chimeras were localized to the nuclear envelope and tubular-reticular structures, presumably the ER (Fig. 2). These results suggest that the presence of a glutamic acid in the TMD of p24 proteins confers localization to the early secretory pathway when the conserved TMD glutamine residue is absent. To further corroborate this finding we performed pulse-chase experiments to measure the rate and extent of transport of the chimeras from the ER through the Golgi complex (Fig.3 A). The time required to receive O-glycans (attached to the CD8 exoplasmic domain) that were processed to the mature (sialic acid-containing) form in the medial- or trans-Golgi (28Pascale M.C. Erra M.C. Malagolini N. Serafini-Cessi F. Leone A. Bonatti S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25196-25201Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was similar for the EA, EA-QA, and EA-FFAA mutant chimeras and comparable to the wild-type form (Fig.3 B) (cf. Ref. 20Fiedler K. Veit M. Stamnes M.A. Rothman J.E. Science. 1996; 273: 1396-1399Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). The QA and QA-FFAA mutant hybrid proteins, however, were not significantly processed within the 2-h chase period (Fig. 3). Charged residues in the TMD confer efficient degradation of monomeric subunits of the T cell antigen receptor in the absence of oligomerization (29Cosson P. Lankford S.P. Bonifacino J.S. Klausner R.D. Nature. 1991; 351: 414-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar, 30Bonifacino J.S. Cosson P. Klausner R.D.

EMBO J. 1991; 10: 2783-2793Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). But as expected from the structural context of the chop24a glutamic acid residue (i.e. TMD length and positioning) (31Bonifacino J.S. Cosson P. Shah N. Klausner R.D. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 2783-2793Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar, 32Lankford S.P. Cosson P. Bonifacino J.S. Klausner R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4814-4820Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), mutant CD8-chop24a chimera retained in the ER were not rapidly degraded since more than 70% of the starting material was present after a 2-h chase for all hybrid proteins. Unexpectedly, the EA-QA-FFAA chimera was processed to the mature form at a substantially higher rate than all other chimeras, including the wild-type CD8-chop24a form (Fig. 3 B) (cf. Ref. 20Fiedler K. Veit M. Stamnes M.A. Rothman J.E. Science. 1996; 273: 1396-1399Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). Apparently, the replacement of all three positions allowed efficient transit from the ER through the Golgi complex. Next, we tested whether the chop24a TMD alone alters the trafficking of the reporter molecule CD8 by replacing the CD8 TMD with the respective sequence of chop24a (data not shown). Pulse-chase experiments showed that the rate of transport of the CD8-chop24a chimera was decreased relative to the CD8 wild-type protein. Sorting signals in the TMD of mammalian and yeast proteins are important for their localization to the Golgi complex and the ER (27Ponnambalam S. Rabouille C. Luzio J.P. Nilsson T. Warren G. J.

Virol. 1996; 70: 6508-6515Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Recycling of the KDEL receptor and Sec12p from the Golgi to the ER and retention of the coronavirus E1 protein in the Golgi are likely to require polar residues in the TMD of the proteins (36Swift A.M.

For some proteins, trafficking determinants have been found in the TMD as well as in the cytoplasmic domain (α2,6-sialyltransferase, Sed5p, Sec12p, and TGN38) (27Ponnambalam S. Rabouille C. Luzio J.P. Nilsson T. Warren G. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 125: 253-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 34Banfield D.K. Lewis M.J. Rabouille C. Warren G. Pelham H.R.B. J.

Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 279-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). The chop24a member of the p24 family of putative cargo receptors (13Stamnes M.A. Craighead M.W. Hoe M.H. Lampen N. Geromanos S. Tempst P. Rothman J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8011-8015Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar) encodes for a glutamic acid in the TMD. This residue appears to serve as an ER retention signal which is attenuated by a conserved glutamine in the TMD and phenylalanine residues in the cytoplasmic tail (Fig. 2). The presence of all three motifs facilitates efficient ER exit and transit through the Golgi complex. Unexpectedly, a EA-QA-FFAA CD8-chop24a hybrid protein that is devoid of all analyzed sorting determinants was delivered to the medial-/trans-Golgi at a significantly higher rate than the wild-type chimera and other hybrid proteins (Fig. 3). Apparently, the presence of phenylalanine residues in the cytoplasmic domain decreases the rate of transit from the ER through the Golgi complex when the TMD glutamic acid and glutamine are absent. Conversely, when the TMD glutamic acid and glutamine are present, the phenylalanine residues increase the rate of transport (20Fiedler K. Veit M. Stamnes M.A. Rothman J.E. Science. 1996; 273: 1396-1399Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). Moreover, the presence of the TMD glutamine residue decreases the rate of transport when the TMD glutamic acid and the phenylalanines are replaced with alanine. Taken together, these observations suggest that the signals present in the TMD and cytoplasmic domain modulate each other. The TMD determinant appears to be transplantable since the exchange of the CD8 TMD alone with the chop24a TMD significantly decreases the rate of transport from the ER through the Golgi complex (data not shown). For a variety of proteins the role of charged amino acids in the TMD has been analyzed in detail. In subunits of the T cell antigen receptor they are involved in quality control of hetero-oligomer assembly by the formation of intramembrane charge pairs (29Cosson P. Lankford S.P. Bonifacino J.S. Klausner R.D. Nature. 1991; 351: 414-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar, 49Manolios N. Bonifacino J.S. Klausner R.D. Science. 1990; 249: 274-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar) and in promoting the formation of intramembrane disulfide-linked dimers (50Rutledge T. Cosson P. Manolios N. Bonifacino J.S. Klausner R.D. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 3245-3254Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Since none of the currently known p24 members contains basic residues or cysteines in the TMD, similar mechanisms for p24 oligomerization seem unlikely. Nevertheless, the recent analysis of the yeast members Emp24p and Erv25p demonstrated that they can be efficiently cross-linked to each other (15Belden W.J. Barlowe C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26939-26946Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar) suggesting that p24 proteins may form hetero-oligomers. It has not been investigated whether p24 proteins can also form homo-oligomers. Several models could account for the differential localization and trafficking of the CD8-chop24a chimeras. It has recently been shown that similarly charged (glutamic acid) or polar (glutamine) TMD residues can promote homodimerization and activation of the receptor tyrosine kinase p185neu (51Chen L.I. Webster M.K. Meyer A.N. Donoghue D.J. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 619-631Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). In the context of p24 proteins this could imply that the TMD is involved in oligomerization. If oligomerization of p24 proteins (and CD8-chop24a chimeras) is required for transport from the ER through the Golgi complex, then the TMD alone is apparently not sufficient for rapid transit. The FFAA chimera in which the phenylalanines in the cytoplasmic domain were replaced with alanine (Fig. 3 (20Fiedler K. Veit M. Stamnes M.A. Rothman J.E. Science. 1996; 273: 1396-1399Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar)) was transported from the ER through the Golgi complex at a significantly lower rate than the wild-type form. Thus, rapid transit requires the phenylalanine residues to aid oligomerization and/or to facilitate interaction with coatomer (20Fiedler K. Veit M. Stamnes M.A. Rothman J.E. Science. 1996; 273: 1396-1399Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). Although this model could explain the modulatory interactions among TMD and cytoplasmic tail signals it does not account for the highly efficient transport of the EA-QA-FFAA CD8-chop24a chimera. Moreover, this premise does not provide an explanation for the apparent decreased rate of transit of CD8-chop24a chimeras that retain only one of the three positions, i.e. the TMD glutamine residue (EA-FFAA), the glutamic acid (QA-FFAA), or the phenylalanine residues in the cytoplasmic domain (EA-QA). Precedence for an alternative model is provided from the analysis of Sec12p in yeast. Two glutamines in the Sec12p TMD were shown to be required for the recycling of escaped protein from the Golgi complex back to the ER (42Sato M. Sato K. Nakano A. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 279-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Proper Sec12p ER localization required Rer1p, a protein primarily localized to the Golgi complex (40Sato K. Nishikawa S. Nakano A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 1459-1477Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 41Boehm J. Ulrich H.D. Ossig R. Schmitt H.D. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3696-3710Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 42Sato M. Sato K. Nakano A. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 279-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 52Boehm J. Letourneur F. Ballensiefen W. Ossipov D. Demolliere C. Schmitt H.D. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 991-1003Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Rer1p contains four TMDs that encode for polar as well as charged residues and is proposed to function as a TMD sorting receptor. A direct interaction with Sec12p remains to be shown. Analogous to Sec12p and Rer1p, p24 recruitment could involve not only the interaction with coatomer (20Fiedler K. Veit M. Stamnes M.A. Rothman J.E. Science. 1996; 273: 1396-1399Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar) but also the binding to other integral membrane proteins of the vesicle budding machinery. These additional protein-protein interactions could ensure the availability of essential machinery components at the budding site (e.g.v-SNAREs (53Sollner T. Whiteheart S.W. Brunner M. Erdjument-Bromage H. Geromanos S. Tempst P. Rothman J.E. Nature. 1993; 362: 318-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (2637) Google Scholar)) and might be mediated by the TMDs of the interacting proteins. Upon interaction with coatomer the p24 proteins would be released into the budding vesicle. Alternatively, efficient recruitment might require the simultaneous interaction of coatomer with both factors which could either trigger dissociation of p24 proteins for recruitment or lead to the recruitment of both components into the budding vesicle. With respect to our analysis of the CD8-chop24a chimeras the second model predicts that the absence of any trafficking signal in the TMD and a coatomer binding motif (e.g. phenylalanines or basic residues) would allow unregulated, passive inclusion into vesicles not restricted by the limited number of coatomer binding sites. This could explain the more rapid transport of the EA-QA-FFAAversus the EA-QA form of the CD8-chop24a chimeras. Similarly, the absence of a TMD signal in a p24 protein (EA-QA-FFAA chimera versus FFAA chimera) could abolish the interaction with a negative regulatory component and effectively increase the rate of transport by bulk flow. It is possible that hitherto unidentified factors, or members of a growing class of multispanning membrane proteins (54Ljungdahl P.O. Gimeno C.J. Styles C.A. Fink G.R.

An unusual member of this family, a sodium-translocating ATPase, has been found in the eubacterium Enterococcus hirae. We report here the purification of enterococcal Na+-ATPase from the plasma membrane of cells, whose ATPase content was highly amplified by expression of the cloned ntp operon that encodes this Na+-ATPase (ntpFIKECGABDHJ). The purified enzyme appears to consist of nine Ntp polypeptides, all the above except for the ntpH and ntpJ gene products. ATPase activity was strictly dependent on the presence of Na+ or Li+ ions and was inhibited by nitrate,N-ethylmaleimide, and the peptide antibiotic destruxin B. When the purified ATPase was reconstituted into liposomes prepared fromEnterococcus faecalis phospholipids, ATP-driven Na+ uptake was observed; uptake was blocked by nitrate, destruxin B, and monensin, but it accelerated by carbonyl cyanidem-chlorophenylhydrazone and valinomycin. These data demonstrate that E. hirae Na+-ATPase is an electrogenic sodium pump of the vacuolar type.

These data demonstrate that E. hirae Na+-ATPase is an electrogenic sodium pump of the vacuolar type. This is a promising system for research on the fundamental molecular structure and mechanism of vacuolar ATPase. Vacuolar ATPases comprise a family of structurally and functionally related enzymes that translocate protons across organelles and plasma membranes of eukaryotic cells (1Nelson N. Taiz L. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1989; 14: 113-116Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar, 2Harvey W.R. J. Exp. Biol. 1992; 172: 1-17PubMed Google Scholar). Proton movements linked to ATP hydrolysis acidify membrane-bound spaces and establish electrochemical proton potentials that serve as the driving force for diverse proton-coupled secondary transporters. Vacuolar ATPase consists of a water-soluble, catalytic V1 moiety and a membrane-integrated V0 portion that conducts protons (3Forgac M. Physiol. Rev. 1992; 69: 765-796Crossref Scopus (480) Google Scholar, 4Stevens T.H. J. Exp. Biol. 1992; 172: 47-55PubMed Google Scholar, 5Nelson N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1100: 109-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar); the vectorial and chemical reactions are coupled when the V0V1 complex is incorporated into membranes. The V1 portions and V0V1 complexes, some of which are reconstitutively active in proton pumping, have been purified from a variety of eukaryotic species, and the amino acid sequences of these components have been determined (4Stevens T.H. J. Exp. Biol. 1992; 172: 47-55PubMed Google Scholar, 5Nelson N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1100: 109-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 6Bowman B.J. Vazquez-Laslop N. Bowman E.J. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1992; 24: 361-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The V0V1 complex has three major subunits: the A and B subunits of the V1 portion and the 17-kDa proton-conducting proteolipid of the V0 portion. The amino acid sequences of these subunits are highly conserved among species and are known to resemble the sequences of the β, α, and c subunits of the F0F1-ATPase (another family of proton-translocating ATPases). It has been proposed that these two ATPase families are phylogenetically related and that the 17-kDa proteolipid of the vacuolar ATPase arose by tandem duplication of the gene for the 8-kDa proteolipid of the F0F1-ATPase (5Nelson N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1100: 109-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 6Bowman B.J. Vazquez-Laslop N. Bowman E.J. J. Bioenerg.

A. 1988; 85: 5521-5524Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). The amino acid sequences of other subunits of vacuolar ATPases are also well conserved among species, but the resemblance of these subunits to those of F0F1-ATPases is not conspicuous. Characterization of the subunits of vacuolar ATPase is most advanced inSaccharomyces cerevisiae, based on molecular genetics (4Stevens T.H. J. Exp. Biol. 1992; 172: 47-55PubMed Google Scholar,8Anraku Y. Konings W.N. Kaback H.R. Lolkema J.S. Handbook of Biological Physics. Elsevier Science, Amsterdam1996: 93-109Google Scholar). Recently two new proteolipids, Vma11p and Vma16p, were found to be subunits of the vacuolar ATPase (9Hirata R. Graham L.A. Takatsuki A. Stevens T.H. Anraku Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4795-4803Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). Thus, the vacuolar ATPase complex of yeast appears to contain at least 13 polypeptides, and purification of the holo enzyme has been attempted (8Anraku Y. Konings W.N. Kaback H.R. Lolkema J.S. Handbook of Biological Physics. Elsevier Science, Amsterdam1996: 93-109Google Scholar, 10Kane P.M. Yamashiro C.T. Stevens T.H. J. Biol.

A. 1989; 86: 6661-6665Crossref PubMed Scopus (538) Google Scholar); archaebacterial proton-translocating ATPases are thought to mediate ATP synthesis (12Schäfer G. Meyering-Vos M. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1992; 671: 293-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). An important variant among vacuolar ATPases is the enzyme from Enterococcus hirae, which transports Na+ rather than H+ under physiological conditions (13Heefner D.L. Harold F.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 2798-2802Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 14Kakinuma Y. Igarashi K. FEBS Lett. 1990; 271: 97-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Our group has purified the catalytic V1 moiety of this ATPase (15Kakinuma Y. Igarashi K. J. Biochem. ( Tokyo ). 1994; 116: 1302-1308Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) and cloned the genes for the complex; the genes form an operon (designated ntp) consisting of 11 genes, ntpFIKECGABDHJ (16Takase K. Yamato I. Kakinuma Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11610-11616Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Kakinuma Y. Kakinuma S. Takase K. Konishi K. Igarashi K. Yamato I. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Chem. 1994; 269: 11037-11044Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The molecular properties of purified V1 and the sequence analysis of these ntp gene products indicate thatEnterococcus Na+-ATPase belongs to the vacuolar ATPase family. Three major subunits of Na+-ATPase, NtpA, NtpB, and NtpK (16-kDa proteolipid), resemble those of the eukaryotic ones; the other genes, ntpD, ntpE,ntpF, and ntpG, encode the polypeptides that resemble the Vma8p, Vma4p, Vma10p, and Vma7p subunits of yeast vacuolar ATPase, respectively, although the sequence similarities were only moderate (23–29% identity; 40–50% similarity). The similarities of the sequences of NtpC and NtpI to those of Vma6p and Vph1p of yeast vacuolar ATPase were less prominent (15–16% identity; 36–37% similarity). However, some amino acid clusters conserved among the corresponding subunits in eukaryotic vacuolar ATPases are conserved in these sequences; in case of NtpI, the sequence around the first membrane-spanning domain of Vph1p is conserved (18Takase K. Kakinuma S. Yamato I. Konishi K. Igarashi K. Kakinuma Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11037-11044Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). ThentpJ gene product is a component of a K+transport system linked to the Na+-ATPase, but it is not essential for the assembly or the operation of the ATPase (19Murata T. Takase K. Yamato I. Igarashi K. Kakinuma Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10042-10047Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). It appears, then, that this vacuolar-type Na+-ATPase consists of fewer than 10 polypeptides. We report here the purification and reconstitution of the E. hirae Na+-ATPase complex as a stage in its biochemical characterization. The ATPase activity of the purified enzyme, which appears to consist of nine Ntp proteins, was inhibited by vacuolar ATPase inhibitors; ATP-driven 22Na+ uptake by reconstituted proteoliposomes was blocked by nitrate and monensin but accelerated by valinomycin. These results suggest that the vacuolar Na+-ATPase of E. hirae is an electrogenic sodium pump. AnEnterococcus-Escherichia coli shuttle vector pCem3 (4.6-kb 1The abbreviations used are: kb, kilobase(s); DM,n-dodecyl α-d-maltoside; CHAPS, 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis.) was constructed by ligating the 1.8-kb BamHI-HindIII fragment (the erythromycin resistance gene) of pJEM2 (19Murata T. Takase K. Yamato I. Igarashi K. Kakinuma Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10042-10047Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) with the 2.8-kbBglII-HindIII fragment of pC3 (20Solioz M. Waser M. Biochimie ( Paris ). 1990; 72: 279-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) carrying the replication origin for these bacteria; pCem3 has single XbaI site. The 18-kb pCemtp18 was constructed by ligation of the 13.4-kbXbaI-XbaI fragment of pKAZ171 (18Takase K. Kakinuma S. Yamato I. Konishi K. Igarashi K. Kakinuma Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11037-11044Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which extends from the promoter region of E. hirae Na+-ATPase (ntp) operon to the end of the ntpJ gene (see Fig. 2 A) to the 4.6-kb XbaI cut of pCem3. pCemtp18 was introduced into E. hirae strain 25D, a mutant defective in production of F0F1, H+-ATPase (14Kakinuma Y. Igarashi K. FEBS Lett. 1990; 271: 97-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The transformed cells were grown on a complex medium (21Kakinuma Y. Harold F.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 2086-2091Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) containing 0.5 m NaCl supplemented with 10 μg/ml erythromycin. Phospholipids were extracted from a large batch of Enterococcus faecalis cells, strain AD1001, grown on the same complex medium. Membrane vesicles were prepared by disintegration of spheroplasts with a French press as described previously (21Kakinuma Y. Harold F.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 2086-2091Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), suspended in buffer A (100 mmTris-HCl, 10 mm MgSO4, 1 mmdithiothreitol, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, pH 7.5) containing 10% glycerol, and stored at −80 °C. The Na+-ATPase was solubilized by incubation of the membrane vesicles (1.5 mg/ml) with 1.5% n-dodecyl α-d-maltoside (DM) (Calbiochem) for 10 min at room temperature and recovered in the supernatant after centrifugation at 230,000 × g (30 min at 4 °C). The supernatant (0.6 ml) was applied to 10 ml of a linear glycerol gradient (10–30%) in buffer A containing 0.1% DM and 0.1 mg/ml dioleoylphosphatidylglycerol (Sigma) and was centrifuged at 175,000 × g for 12 h at 4 °C. After dividing into 18 fractions (0.6 ml each), the ATPase activity of the fractions was determined. One unit of the ATPase activity was defined as corresponding to 1 μmol of ATP hydrolyzed/min. The phospholipids ofE. faecalis AD1001 were extracted and purified from the cell mass by silica gel chromatography, as described elsewhere (22Hanada K. Yamato I. Anraku Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 7181-7185Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Proteoliposomes were produced by a freeze-thaw and dilution method (22Hanada K. Yamato I. Anraku Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 7181-7185Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) as follows. 25 μl of the purified enzyme (0.05 mg/ml) was mixed with 100 μl of the liposome suspension (50 mg of phospholipid/ml) in buffer B (50 mm Tris-HCl, 100 mm KCl, 10 mm MgSO4, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 2 mm dithiothreitol, pH 7.5) and supplemented with 11.4 μl of 15% CHAPS. After incubation for 10 min at 4 °C, the mixture was frozen in dry ice/acetone, thawed, and sonicated for 5 s. The mixture was finally diluted 200-fold into buffer B, and the proteoliposomes were recovered by centrifugation at 150,000 ×g for 90 min. The liposomes were suspended in 0.1 ml of buffer B and stored at 4 °C. The proteoliposomes were suspended in 2 ml of buffer B (0.6 μg of protein/ml); 0.1 mm22NaCl (6,500 cpm/nmol) was added to the mixture and allowed to equilibrate for 30 min. The uptake reaction was started by the addition of 5 mm ATP. Inhibitors or ionophores were added at 10 min before the addition of ATP. At intervals, 90 μl of the reaction mixture was filtered on a nitrocellulose filter (0.2-μm pore size, Toyo Roshi Co. Ltd., Tokyo) with suction and washed twice quickly with 4 ml of buffer B. The radioactivity trapped on the filter was measured with a liquid scintillation counter. Rabbit antisera against various Ntp proteins were prepared by injection of a synthetic peptide for each protein conjugated to keyhole limpet hemocyanin. All antisera were purchased by Nippon Bio-Test Lab. Inc. (Tokyo) and Takara Shuzo Co. (Kyoto). The amino acid sequences of the oligopeptides synthesized were the following: CKTVEKYVNHKKK (near the COOH terminus of NtpI), GLIIDDAGIQYNFLF (the COOH terminus of NtpE), LEKEEEEIAKKKNL (the COOH terminus of NtpF), MMDYLITONGGMV (the NH2 terminus of NtpK), and RAEANYKYPEESIM (near the COOH terminus of NtpJ). The purified enzyme was subjected to SDS-PAGE on 12.5% gel and electroblotted to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Bio-Rad). After staining with Coomassie Brilliant Blue, the bands corresponding to the 38-, 29-, and 8-kDa subunits were cut out, and the NH2-terminal sequences of the polypeptides were analyzed with the HP G1005A protein sequencing system (Hewlet Packard) by Takara Shuzo Co. SDS-PAGE was carried out using the system of Laemmli (23Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207231) Google Scholar) and stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250 or silver. Western blotting was performed as described elsewhere (24Murata T. Yamato I. Igarashi K. Kakinuma Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23661-23666Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar); spots were visualized by using goat anti-rabbit IgG conjugated to alkaline phosphatase. The Na+-ATPase activity of the purified enzyme was determined in the presence of 25 mm NaCl as described previously (21Kakinuma Y. Harold F.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 2086-2091Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); the reaction was started by the addition of 2 mm ATP, sometimes after a 10-min preincubation with various compounds. Protein was determined according to the method of Lowryet al. (25Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), with bovine serum albumin as standard.22NaCl was obtained from NEN Life Science Products (1.36 TBq/mmol). The efficacy of various detergents for the solubilization of Na+-ATPase was examined first. Among the detergents tested (DM, Tween 80, octyl d-glucoside, Brij-58, Brij-35, CHAPS, cholate, C12E8, C12E9, C12E10, and Triton X-100), DM was the best for this enzyme. When the membrane vesicles were incubated with 1.5% DM, the activity of Na+-ATPase in the suspension doubled. This increase probably resulted from the disintegration of membrane structure because about half of the E. hirae vesicles prepared with the French press are everted (26Kobayashi H. Van Brunt J. Harold F.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 2085-2092Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Under the conditions described in this paper, more than 80% of the membrane proteins were solubilized, and nearly 100% of total Na+-ATPase activity was recovered, suggesting that nearly all of the Na+-ATPase was solubilized in its native form (Fig.1, inset). Further purification was accomplished by centrifugation through a linear glycerol gradient from 10 to 30% (Fig. 1). We observed a single peak of Na+-ATPase activity which was relatively sharp and also a peak of protein which coincided with that of ATPase activity; most of the applied protein was recovered in the upper fractions. Importantly, the specific activities of Na+-ATPase in fractions 4, 5, 6, and 7 were constant at 21 units/mg protein, which indicates a 10-fold purification from the DM extracts. About 80% of the Na+-ATPase solubilized with DM was recovered in these four fractions. The activity of solubilized enzyme was stable at 4 °C for at least 1 week and for 3 months at −80 °C. Eight polypeptides with apparent molecular masses of 69, 52, 38, 27, 24, 15, 14, and 8 kDa were observed when the purified fractions (fractions 5, 6, and 7) were analyzed by SDS-PAGE (12.5% gel; Fig. 2 B,lanes 3, 4, and 5). The 69-kDa protein band split into two bands of 69 and 65 kDa on 10% gel (Fig.2 B, lane 6), but no additional bands were observed by electrophoresis with different concentrations of acrylamide. The purified enzyme most probably consists of these nine polypeptides. Determination of the NH2-terminal sequences of the 38-kDa (MEYHELN), 27-kDa (MRLNVNP), and 8-kDa (TYKIGVV) bands indicated that these polypeptides correspond to the ntpC, ntpD, and ntpG gene products, respectively, of the Na+-ATPase operon (Fig. 2 A). Fig. 2 Cshows Western blots of the fractions obtained from glycerol gradient centrifugation (Fig. 1), with various antisera. We have purified the V1 catalytic moiety of this enzyme previously; it has a molecular mass of about 400 kDa and consists of three subunits, A, B, and D, with a stoichiometry of 3:3:1 (14Kakinuma Y. Igarashi K. FEBS Lett. 1990; 271: 97-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The 69- and 52-kDa polypeptides of the enzyme purified here were assigned to the A and B subunits, by Western blotting with antiserum against purified V1 moiety (Fig. 2 C). Using the antisera against the synthetic oligopeptides for the deduced amino acid sequences of thentpE, ntpF, and ntpK gene products, the 24-, 15-, and 14-kDa polypeptides of the purified enzyme were assigned to the NtpE, NtpF, and NtpK proteins, respectively. These polypeptides reacting with anti-E, -F, and -K sera comigrated with NtpA and NtpB subunits in glycerol gradient centrifugation (Fig.2 C). We also found that the 65-kDa band (Fig. 2 B, lane 6), migrating slightly faster than the 69-kDa (A) subunit, reacted with anti-NtpI serum (Fig. 2 C). This protein also comigrated with other Na+-ATPase subunits during centrifugation. Because the COOH-terminal half of the sequence of the ntpIgene product (M r 75,619) is hydrophobic (18Takase K. Kakinuma S. Yamato I. Konishi K. Igarashi K. Kakinuma Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11037-11044Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the mobility of NtpI protein in SDS-PAGE may be affected. Thus, the purified enzyme probably consists of nine ntp gene products of the operon (Fig. 2 A) but does not contain thentpH and ntpJ gene products. The subunit ratio of purified enzyme was tentatively estimated by densitometric analysis of the amounts of Coomassie dye bound to these polypeptides. The apparent molar ratios of A, I, B, C, D, E, F, K, and G subunits were 3:1–2:3:1:1:3:1–2:3–4:1, although the exact estimation necessitates more detailed investigation. Fig.3 A shows the activation of ATPase activity of the purified enzyme by Na+ or Li+ ions. The ATP hydrolysis rate of purified enzyme increased with the Na+ concentration, until saturation was reached at about 100 mm NaCl (Fig. 3 A,inset). This is in accord with the proposal that the activity of the intact V0V1 complex of E. hirae Na+-ATPase requires stimulation by Na+ (27Kakinuma Y. Igarashi K. FEBS Lett. 1990; 271: 102-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Extrapolation of the activation curve to zero Na+ concentration suggested that as much as 20% of the maximal ATPase activity may be Na+-independent. However, because all assay media were contaminated with 5–10 μmNa+, we think that the purified enzyme is coupled tightly to Na+. ATPase activity was also stimulated by Li+ (Fig. 3 A) but not by Cs+ or K+. The K m value for ATP of the purified enzyme was about 0.5 mm (Fig. 3 B), nearly identical to the value (K m = 0.6 mm) measured for the Na+-ATPase of membrane vesicles (21Kakinuma Y. Harold F.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 2086-2091Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The sensitivity of Na+-ATPase of the membrane vesicles to various reagents has been investigated (14Kakinuma Y. Igarashi K. FEBS Lett. 1990; 271: 97-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 15Kakinuma Y. Igarashi K. J. Biochem. ( Tokyo ). 1994; 116: 1302-1308Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 21Kakinuma Y. Harold F.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 2086-2091Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The Na+-ATPase activity of the membranes was inhibited by vacuolar ATPase inhibitors such as nitrate (K i = 10 mm) and N-ethylmaleimide (K i= 0.15 mm), but not by bafilomycin A1, which strongly inhibits the eukaryotic vacuolar ATPase at a concentration below 1 μm (28Bowman E.J. Siebers A. Altendorf K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 7972-7976Crossref PubMed Scopus (1599) Google Scholar). The sensitivity of the purified enzyme to these reagents was the same (Table I). The Na+-ATPase activity was inhibited by nitrate (K i = 37 mm) andN-ethylmaleimide (K i = 0.2 mm), but not by concanamycin A, another macrolide antibiotic that powerfully inhibits the vacuolar ATPase (28Bowman E.J. Siebers A. Altendorf K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 7972-7976Crossref PubMed Scopus (1599) Google Scholar). The peptide antibiotic destruxin B, known to inhibit the vacuolar ATPase (29Muroi M. Shiragami N. Takatsuki A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 205: 1358-1365Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), is also effective against the purified Na+-ATPase at the same concentrations (K i = 30 μm).N,N′-Dicyclohexylcarbodiimide inhibited the purified enzyme, probably attacking the glutamic acid residue (Glu-139) of the NtpK proteolipid as proposed for other eukaryotic vacuolar ATPases (3Forgac M. Physiol. Rev. 1992; 69: 765-796Crossref Scopus (480) Google Scholar, 4Stevens T.H. J. Exp. Biol. 1992; 172: 47-55PubMed Google Scholar, 5Nelson N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1100: 109-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Azide and vanadate were without any significant effect on the Na+-ATPase of this bacterium. Thus, the effects of various compounds on purified Na+-ATPase are in good accord with the features of a vacuolar ATPase.Table IEffect of various ATPase inhibitors on the ATP hydrolytic activity of purified enzymeReagentConcentrationRelative Na+-ATPase activitymm%Control100KNO33056N -Ethylmaleimide0.252Concanamycin A0.00598Destruxin B0.0349N,N′ -Dicyclohexylcarbodiimide0.210Vanadate190Azide10100The Na+-ATPase activity of purified enzyme was determined as described under “Materials and Methods” after a 10-min incubation of the enzyme at 25 °C with the inhibitor at the concentrations indicated. 100% activity corresponds to 0.5 unit. Open table in a new tab The Na+-ATPase activity of purified enzyme was determined as described under “Materials and Methods” after a 10-min incubation of the enzyme at 25 °C with the inhibitor at the concentrations indicated. 100% activity corresponds to 0.5 unit. The purified ATPase was incorporated into liposomes by a freeze-thaw/dilution method, and Fig.4 shows the time course of Na+ transport into such proteoliposomes. Virtually no Na+ was transported into the vesicles in the absence of ATP (Fig. 4 A). Upon its addition, Na+ rapidly accumulated inside the liposomes, reaching a steady state in about 10 min. Accumulation of Na+ ions was prevented by incubation of the proteoliposomes with 50 mm nitrate or 50 μm destruxin B (Fig. 4 A). Transport of Na+ was influenced markedly by the presence of certain ionophores (Fig. 4 B). Na+ uptake into the proteoliposomes was abolished completely by the Na+-carrying ionophore monensin. On the other hand, valinomycin, in the presence of K+, stimulated the Na+ transport rate more than 2-fold, and the protonophore carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone also promoted it significantly. These results are indicative of an electrogenic Na+ transport by purified Na+-ATPase: a membrane potential that limits the transport rate is dissipated by increasing the conductance of K+ or H+across the membranes. The initial rate of Na+ uptake (Fig. 4 A) was about 0.1 μmol/min/mg of purified enzyme, which is only 1.4% of the enzyme's ATP hydrolytic activity (7 μmol/min/mg protein) measured under the same condition. However, we shall set aside this inconsistency for the present because we know nothing about the amount of Na+-ATPase incorporated into the liposomes, the orientation of the enzyme in the membrane, and, most possibly, the leakiness of proteoliposomes to Na+ ions. We would note, however, that this is the first clearly demonstrated example of vacuolar ATPase that acts as a primary Na+ pump. E. hirae has an active K+transport system designated KtrII; investigations with intact cells (21Kakinuma Y. Harold F.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 2086-2091Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) led to the proposal that this is a primary system tightly linked to the action of the Na+-ATPase. The ntpJ gene, the tail end of the ntp operon (Fig. 2 A), encodes a putative 49-kDa hydrophobic protein that resembles various K+ transporters of yeast and bacteria (18Takase K. Kakinuma S. Yamato I. Konishi K. Igarashi K. Kakinuma Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11037-11044Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although this kind of polypeptide has not so far been found as a subunit of vacuolar proton ATPases in eukaryotes, the hypothesis that the NtpJ protein may be the part of the Na+-ATPase complex was attractive. We have suggested recently that the ntpJ gene product is a component of the KtrII K+ transport system, functionally independent of the Na+-ATPase activity (19Murata T. Takase K. Yamato I. Igarashi K. Kakinuma Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10042-10047Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Western blotting with antiserum against the oligopeptide for the NtpJ sequence was done for the fractions from glycerol gradient centrifugation (Fig.5). We found that the NtpJ protein, observed mainly in fractions 13 and 15 (Fig. 5 B), was separable from the Na+-ATPase complex; only the A, B, C, and K subunits were observed here by silver staining in the fractions containing the peak of Na+-ATPase activity (Fig.5 A, fractions 5 and 7). Moreover, neither the activity nor the assembly of Na+-ATPase was impaired in anntpJ-disrupted strain (19Murata T. Takase K. Yamato I. Igarashi K. Kakinuma Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10042-10047Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). These results suggest that the NtpJ protein is not part of the E. hiraeNa+-ATPase complex. Sodium ions regulate the induction of Na+-ATPase inE. hirae (30Kakinuma Y. Igarashi K. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1989; 21: 679-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Transcription of the Na+-ATPase operon is stimulated under conditions where the intracellular Na+ concentration is high (24Murata T. Yamato I. Igarashi K. Kakinuma Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23661-23666Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). In Na+-limited medium, on the other hand, the sodium pumping activity via this ATPase is minimal. In the background to this work, we transformed pKAZ191 (18Takase K. Kakinuma S. Yamato I. Konishi K. Igarashi K. Kakinuma Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11037-11044Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), harboring the whole ntp operon without its 5′-promoter region, into an Na+-ATPase-defective mutant Nak1 (31Kakinuma Y. Igarashi K. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 1732-1735Crossref PubMed Google Scholar); the operon is transcribed by the promoter activity of the vector. Cells of Nak1/pKAZ191 exhibited sodium pumping activity even on low Na+ medium. We also observed that the Na+-ATPase activity of strain Nak1 transformed with pKAZ192 (18Takase K. Kakinuma S. Yamato I. Konishi K. Igarashi K. Kakinuma Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11037-11044Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), harboring the whole ntp operon including its promoter, was stimulated by the Na+ concentration in the medium, suggesting that active Na+-ATPase is expressed by the Na+-responsive ntp operon containing thesentp genes (Fig. 2 A) (24Murata T. Yamato I. Igarashi K. Kakinuma Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23661-23666Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Several aspects of the purification of Na+-ATPase should be emphasized. First, the enzyme was induced strongly by Na+; complex medium supplemented with 500 mm NaCl (final, 650 mm Na+) was used. The specific activity of the Na+-ATPase of the membrane vesicles was 0.15 unit/mg of protein. The amount of Na+-ATPase was enhanced further by introducing the operon on a multicopy shuttle vector pCem3, although the copy number was not determined exactly; the ATP hydrolytic activity of the membranes was 0.75 unit/mg of protein. Because the organism also contains the proton-translocating F0F1-ATPase (33Abrams A. Martonosi A.N. Enzymes in Biological Membranes. 2nd Ed. Plenum Press, New York1985: 177-193Google Scholar), the Na+-ATPase was purified from a mutant (25D) defective in the production of the H+-ATPase (14Kakinuma Y. Igarashi K. FEBS Lett. 1990; 271: 97-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). This avoided cross-contamination of the H+-ATPase during the purification of Na+-ATPase. It also diminished the proton-motive force of the cells, thus increasing their internal Na+ concentration, which is normally kept low by a Na+/H+ antiporter (30Kakinuma Y. Igarashi K. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1989; 21: 679-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Judging by the amount of the 65-kDa A subunit in the membrane proteins (Fig. 2 B,lane 1), the Na+-ATPase made up more than 10% of total membrane proteins. Second, phospholipids were added to all fractions during solubilization and purification of this enzyme. We have observed much lower activity of purified Na+-ATPase in the absence of the phospholipid. However, the enzyme seems to be stable even in this situation because the activity was recovered upon addition of phospholipid. Among the phospholipids examined, the total phospholipid of E. faecalis showed the best stimulation of the Na+-ATPase, although acidic phospholipids such as phosphatidylglycerol or phosphatidylserine were also stimulatory. Finally, the non-ionic detergent, dodecyl maltoside, was the best for solubilization and did not cause disintegration of the Na+-ATPase complex. The specific Na+-ATPase activity of the final sample was about 21 units/mg of protein, approximately 23 times higher than that of the cell membranes, suggesting that isolated enzyme is highly purified. The kinetics of ATPase activation by Na+ or Li+are biphasic (Fig. 3 A). The K m values for Na+ were estimated to be about 20 μm and 4 mm, and the K m values for Li+ were 60 μm and about 3.5 mm. The high affinity for Na+ or Li+ ions is physiologically favorable when considering the intracellular ion concentration (30Kakinuma Y. Igarashi K. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1989; 21: 679-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). On the other hand, the low affinity (K m = 5–7 mm) of the ATP hydrolytic activity for Na+ has been estimated with membrane-bound ATPase (21Kakinuma Y. Harold F.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 2086-2091Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that the low affinity for Na+ takes part in the reaction of this enzyme. A definite role of these kinetic parameters in the ion-coupling mechanism of this enzyme should be elucidated although it is yet unknown. SDS-PAGE and Western blotting revealed nine Ntp proteins in theE. hirae Na+-ATPase: the A, B, C, D, E, F, G, I, and K subunits. The ntpJ gene product, which is a component of the KtrII K+ transport system functionally independent of the Na+-ATPase, is apparently not the part of the complex (Fig. 5). We do not know if the ntpH gene product is a component of the Na+-ATPase. Because there is no strong Shine-Dalgarno sequence upstream of this minigene (18Takase K. Kakinuma S. Yamato I. Konishi K. Igarashi K. Kakinuma Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11037-11044Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we tentatively consider that ntpH is not an open reading frame, although proof of this notion requires further investigation. A search for homologs of the Ntp proteins in data bases indicated that nine putative genes of the genome of Methanococcus jannaschii correspond to the ntpA, -B, -C, -D,-E, -F, -G, -I, and-K genes for the E. hirae Na+-ATPase. These genes are likely to form an operon with the same gene order as that of the E. hirae operon, except for thentpD-like gene (34Bult C.J. White O. Olsen G.J. Zhou L. Fleischmann R.D. Sutton G.G. Blake J.A. FitzGerald L.M. Clayton R.A. Gocayne J.D. Kerlavage A.R. Dougherty B.A. Tomb J.F. Adams M.D. Reich C.I. Overbeek R. Kirkness E.F. Weinstock K.G. Merrick J.M. Glodek A. Scott J.L. Geoghagen N.S.M. Venter J.C. Science. 1996; 273: 1058-1073Crossref PubMed Scopus (2287) Google Scholar). Taking into account the data reported for other archaebacterial ATPases (35Wilms R. Freiberg C. Wegerle E. Meier I. Mayer F. Müller V. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18843-18852Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), it is likely that the nine subunits constitute the basic complex of bacterial vacuolar ATPases. The V1 moiety is easily dissociated from the V0moiety by chelating Mg2+ (27Kakinuma Y. Igarashi K. FEBS Lett. 1990; 271: 102-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). EDTA washing of the proteoliposomes suggested that the A, B, C, D, E, and G subunits are likely to make up the V1 subunit. Densitometric analysis of purified enzyme stained with Coomassie dye suggested that the A, I, B, C, D, E, F, K, and G subunits of E. hiraeNa+-ATPase occurred in a molar ratio of 3:1–2:3:1:1:3:1–2:3–4:1. The ratios of the A, B, and D subunits were identical with those of the purified catalytic moiety of this Na+-ATPase (15Kakinuma Y. Igarashi K. J. Biochem. ( Tokyo ). 1994; 116: 1302-1308Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Peng et al. (32Peng S.B. Zhang Y. Tsai S.J. Xie X.S. Stone D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11356-11360Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) found higher molar ratio of E subunit/vacuolar ATPase complex in clathrin-coated vesicles. In this context, it is noteworthy that the ratio of E subunit/complex was reproducibly 3 by Coomassie staining in our estimation. We are now engaged in determining the exact molar ratio of Ntp subunits, especially focusing on the possibility that the E subunit may be another major subunit of the vacuolar ATPases. The E. hirae sodium pump is the first demonstrated example of a Na+-translocating ATPase having a vacuolar ATPase structure; the purified ATPase retained the capacity for electrogenic Na+ pumping by the reconstituted proteoliposomes (Fig. 4). Although this Na+-ATPase, as well as archaebacterial ATPases, is insensitive to macrolide antibiotics such as bafilomycin A1 or concanamycin A, the molecular resemblance to the H+-translocating vacuolar ATPase of many other organisms suggests that the fundamental mechanism of ion transport is equivalent in these phylogenetically related enzymes. This sodium-coupled E. hirae system has yielded new insights into the catalytic mechanism of these enzymes, and it has many advantages for the investigation of the energy coupling mechanism.

This was done in a renaturation buffer containing 0.5 m guanidinium chloride, 60 μm oxidized glutathione, and 20 μm reduced dithiothreitol, in which the aggregation of lysozyme was minimized and where a renaturation yield of 80% was obtained. The refolded protein could not be distinguished from the native lysozyme by activity, compactness, stability, and several spectroscopic measurements. The kinetics of renaturation were then studied by following the reactivation and the changes in fluorescence and circular dichroism signals. When bi- or triphasic sequential models were fitted to the experimental data, the first two phases had the same calculated rate constants for all the signals showing that, within the time resolution of these experiments, the folding/oxidation of hen lysozyme is highly cooperative, with the secondary structure, the tertiary structure, and the integrity of the active site appearing simultaneously.

Since Anfinsen's work on the in vitro renaturation of unfolded ribonuclease A (1Anfinsen C.B. Science. 1973; 181: 223-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (5217) Google Scholar), it is commonly accepted that all the information required for a protein to fold properly is contained in its amino acid sequence. However, the code that allows the formation of a fully folded protein from its amino acid sequence has not yet been deciphered. Three models are currently proposed to describe this process. The framework model is a sequential model in which secondary structure elements form first followed by a tighter packing of the molecule (2Kim P.S. Baldwin R.L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1982; 51: 459-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (954) Google Scholar). Another model assumes that the polypeptide chain undergoes a rapid collapse driven by hydrophobic forces that would yield an intermediate close to the molten globule (3Dill K. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 1501-1509Crossref PubMed Scopus (1100) Google Scholar). In the puzzle model (4Harrison S.C. Durbin R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 4028-4030Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar) structural elements form at different sites on the polypeptide chain, and their formation induces further folding of the whole protein. According to experimental data, it is not yet possible to determine which model most accurately describes the folding mechanism. However, some general features of protein folding have arisen. Stopped-flow circular dichroism studies showed that a large amount of secondary structure is formed in the dead time (milliseconds time range) of the observation. This has been observed for proteins such as α-lactalbumin and lysozyme (5Kuwajima K. Hiraoka Y. Ikegushi M. Sugai S. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 874-881Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar), dihydrofolate reductase (6Kuwajima K. Garvey E.P. Finn B.E. Matthews C.R. Sugai S. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 7693-7703Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar), and holocytochrome c (7Elöve G.A. Chaffotte A.-F. Roder H. Goldberg M.E. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 6876-6883Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). On the other hand, when using pulsed proton exchange followed by NMR identification of the protected protons, the formation of stable secondary structure elements could be detected over a slower observable time range (8Udgaonkar J.B. Baldwin R.L. Nature. 1988; 335: 694-699Crossref PubMed Scopus (567) Google Scholar, 9Roder H. Elove G.A. Englander S.W. Nature. 1988; 335: 700-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (825) Google Scholar). Using both techniques to observe the folding of the same protein, as was the case for cytochrome c (7Elöve G.A. Chaffotte A.-F. Roder H. Goldberg M.E. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 6876-6883Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar), lysozyme (10Radford S.E. Dobson M.C. Evans P.A. Nature. 1992; 358: 302-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (730) Google Scholar, 11Chaffotte A.-F. Guillou Y. Goldberg M.E. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 9694-9702Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar), and interleukin-1β (12Varley P. Gronenborn A.M. Christensen H. Wingfield P.T. Pain R.H. Clore G.M. Science. 1993; 260: 1110-1113Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar), secondary structures could be observed by CD at a stage where pulsed proton exchange/NMR failed to detect protected protons. This apparent contradiction suggested that secondary structure elements could form without providing an efficient protection against proton exchange. This was confirmed by studies on a model peptide that mimics early folding intermediates, the C-terminal F2 domain of the β2 subunit of Escherichia coli tryptophan synthase (13Chaffotte A.-F. Cadieux C. Guillou Y. Goldberg M.E. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 4303-4308Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar,14Guijarro J.I. Jackson M. Chaffotte A.-F. Delepierre M. Mantsch H.H. Goldberg M.E. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 2998-3008Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). These studies showed that in isolated F2 the secondary structure elements were in such a fast equilibrium that their protons were only weakly protected from exchange. Hence the initial secondary structures that are present in very early folding intermediates appear to be poorly stabilized. A major question in solving the folding problem is to understand the relative roles of local versus long range interactions in controlling the folding process. While both types of interactions are obviously linked energetically throughout the folding pathway, and both determine the stabilities of all the folding intermediates (15Creighton T.E. BioEssays. 1988; 8: 57-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar), the predominance of one over the other is at the basis of the distinction between the framework, the jigsaw puzzle, and the hydrophobic collapse models. The propensity of short natural amino acid sequences to spontaneously form native-like secondary structures through local interactions has been the focus of much attention and has lent much support to the framework model (16Baldwin R.L. J. Biomol. NMR. 1995; 5: 103-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). Yet, several well documented cases are described in the literature where the protein fails to show any detectable secondary structure when long range interactions are not formed. Thus, in the absence of long range interactions between the heme and the polypeptide chain, apocytochrome c remains completely unfolded and shows no secondary structure under conditions where the holoprotein refolds completely (17Fisher W.R. Taniuchi H. Anfinsen C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1973; 248: 3188-3195Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It thus appears that native tertiary contacts play an important role not only in the late stages of the folding but also to initiate or stabilize the formation of the secondary structure. A similar conclusion was reached for lysozyme, based on the following observations. When the native disulfide bonds are maintained in the denatured state, the protein recovers the majority of its secondary structure in less than 4 ms (11Chaffotte A.-F. Guillou Y. Goldberg M.E. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 9694-9702Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). In contrast, the species that are present after 4 ms of refolding of the reduced form have a random-coil CD signal in the far UV region (18Goldberg M.E. Guillou Y. Protein Sci. 1994; 3: 883-887Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Yet, the reduced lysozyme is able to slowly recover its native structure when the disulfides are allowed to form (19Saxena V.P. Wetlaufer D.B. Biochemistry. 1970; 9: 5015-5022Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar). Therefore, and because of the wealth of information available on the mechanism of its folding, lysozyme appeared as a good model to investigate the influence of long range interactions (i.e. native disulfide bonds) on the early stages of the folding process. The question we would like to answer could be stated in the following manner: does the formation of the secondary structure bring together the cysteines in the proper conformation to form native disulfide bonds, or do the disulfide bridges form first thereby constraining the polypeptide chain in such a state that formation of secondary structure is induced? The strategy we shall employ to answer this question is to compare the kinetics of recovery of secondary structure and disulfide bonds during the oxidative folding of the reduced wild-type lysozyme and of mutant lysozymes missing some of the cysteine pairs. As a first step in this study, we focused on monitoring the recovery of the CD signal throughout the refolding. Since at the protein concentrations required for CD measurements, the reduced unfolded lysozyme rapidly forms aggregates in conventional buffers, we had to design renaturation conditions that would minimize aggregation. In this report, we describe a buffer system that leads to an efficient renaturation of reduced lysozyme and that is compatible with kinetic far UV CD measurements. The renatured lysozyme thus obtained will be shown to be identical to the native protein, and the kinetics of renaturation monitored by far UV CD, by intrinsic fluorescence, and by enzymatic activity will be reported. Hen egg white lysozyme (HEWL) 1The abbreviations used are: HEWL, hen egg white lysozyme; DTT, dithiothreitol; GdnHCl, guanidine hydrochloride; KPi, potassium phosphate; NOESY, nuclear Overhauser effect spectroscopy. and oxidized glutathione (GSSG) were purchased from Boehringer Mannheim GmbH, Germany, reduced dithiothreitol (DTT) and Micrococcus lysodeikticus from Sigma, and guanidine hydrochloride (GdnHCl) and urea from ICN Biomedicals. Reduced/denatured lysozyme was prepared as described by Goldberg et al.(20Goldberg M.E. Rudolph R. Jaenicke R. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 2790-2797Crossref PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar). The lyophilized reduced/denatured lysozyme was dissolved at 10 mg/ml in 6 mGdnHCl, 0.1 m acetic acid, pH 2.5. Refolding was initiated upon a 100-fold dilution, under strong vortex agitation, in renaturation buffer (0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.2, 1 mm EDTA, 20 μm DTT, 60 μmGSSG). The samples were then incubated at 25 °C. Lysozyme activity was measured by mixing 20-μl aliquots of lysozyme solution (0.1 mg/ml) with 0.980 ml of aM. lysodeikticus solution (0.25 mg/ml) in 66 mmmonobasic potassium phosphate (KPi), pH 6.2, equilibrated at 25 °C. The samples were mixed by repeatedly inverting the cuvette for 15 s. The slope of the linear part of the decrease in turbidity, monitored at 450 nm, was taken as the lytic activity. One unit of activity corresponds to an absorbance decrease of 0.0026/min. The concentrations of lysozyme were measured by absorbance at 280 nm using extinction coefficients of 2.63 cm2·mg−1 for the native form and 2.37 cm2·mg−1 for the reduced/denatured form (20Goldberg M.E. Rudolph R. Jaenicke R. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 2790-2797Crossref PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar). Reduced/unfolded lysozyme (0.1 mg/ml) was incubated in the renaturation buffer at 25 °C for 24 h. The protein was then dialyzed against 10 mm KPi, pH 5.5, for 48 h and against 50 mm ammonium acetate, pH 5.5, for another 48 h. The ratio between the lysozyme solution volume and the dialysis buffer volume was about 1/100, and the dialysis buffer was changed every 12 h. At that point, the lysozyme was concentrated about 10-fold using an Amicon DIAFLO cell and a YM3 membrane. After subsequent centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 30 min, the supernatant was lyophilized, and the protein was kept at −20 °C. Gel filtration was performed on a Superdex-75 HR 10/30 column hooked up to a Pharmacia FPLC® system. The column was equilibrated and eluted with the renaturation buffer. The column flow rate was 0.5 ml/mn. Native and denatured lysozyme were incubated for 24 h in renaturation buffer. Both samples were then centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 30 min, to eliminate large aggregates, and 200 μl of each supernatant were loaded on the column. Analytical ultracentrifugation was performed in a Beckman XLA ultracentrifuge, equilibrated at 20 °C, using standard double sector cells. Both native and renatured lysozyme were dialyzed against the same renaturation buffer for 20 h and were centrifuged at 55,000 rpm. The lysozyme concentration was around 0.1 mg/ml. Once the final speed was reached, radial scans at 280 nm were recorded at 20-min intervals. After completion of the seventh scan the apparent sedimentation coefficients were calculated using the second moment method of the XLA-Vel program provided with the XLA-Data Analysis Software (Beckman Instruments, Palo Alto, CA). For recording the CD and the fluorescence spectra, the protein was resuspended in 10 mmKPi, pH 7, at a concentration of 0.1 mg/ml. The instruments were the same as those used for the kinetic analysis (see below). All the spectra were the average of three scans and were corrected by subtracting the spectrum of the buffer recorded under the same conditions just before analyzing the protein. The CD spectra were recorded between 190 and 260 nm, with a spacing of 1 nm, and an integration time of 2 s in a 5-mm optical path cell. The fluorescence spectra were recorded with an integration time of 1 s and an interval of 0.5 nm. The emission band pass was 2.125 nm, and the excitation band pass was 4.25 nm. The excitation wavelength was 295 nm, and the spectra were recorded between 310 and 380 nm, using a cuvette with a 4-mm excitation pathlength and a 1-cm emission pathlength. The mass spectrometry experiments were performed on a Platform spectrometer coupled with an electrospray source (Fisons Instruments, Manchester, UK). The flow rate was 5 μl/min, and the proteins were dissolved in a 1:1 mixture of acetonitrile and water containing 0.2% formic acid. Three different samples were used for the NMR experiments as follows: one corresponding to the native lysozyme, one corresponding to the native lysozyme incubated in the renaturing buffer, and the renatured lysozyme sample. All the samples were dialyzed extensively against dilute HCl, pH 3, before use and freeze-dried. The lyophilized powder was dissolved in 40 μl of D2O (Euriso-Top). The lysozyme concentration, as measured from UV absorbance at 280 nm, was 6.2 mm for the native lysozyme, 0.9 mm for the native lysozyme subjected to the renaturing buffer, and 2.8 mm for the renatured lysozyme.1H NMR experiments, using a Nano-NMR probe (Varian), were run at 500 MHz on a Varian Unity spectrometer with an on-line Sun Sparc 2 workstation. The Nano-NMR probe provides high resolution spectra from liquid samples of only 40 μl (21Manzi A. Salimath P.V. Spiro R.C. Keifer P.A. Freeze H.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9154-9163Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) as a result of high resolution magnetic susceptibility matching probe technology used in conjunction to magic angle spinning (22Fitch W.L. Detre G. Holmes C.M. Shoolery J.N. Kiefer P.A. J. Org. Chem. 1994; 59: 7955-7956Crossref Scopus (224) Google Scholar). The experimental data were processed using the VNMR 5.1B program. The spectral width was 7200 Hz and the spinning rate around 2 kHz. Spectra were referred to the water signal at 4.68 ppm at 35 °C (relative to 3-trimethylsilyl-(2,2,3,3-2H4)-propionate, the external reference). Quadrature detection was employed in all experiments with the carrier frequency always maintained at the solvent resonance. The two-dimensional 1H NMR spectra were recorded in the phase-sensitive mode (23States D.J. Haberkorn R.A. Rubens D.J. J. Magn. Reson. 1982; 48: 286-292Google Scholar) with 3200 data points in thet 2 dimension and 440 t 1increments. 8, 48, or 64 scans were acquired for the NOESY experiments depending on the concentration with a single mixing time of 150 ms allowing a direct comparison with previously published data (24Redfield C. Dobson C.M. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 122-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). Zero filling was applied prior to Fourier transformation, and data were processed with shifted sine bell window functions in both dimensions. Low power selective irradiation during the recycling delay and, for NOESY spectra, during the mixing period was used to suppress the residual water peak. The microcalorimetry experiments were performed on a VP-DSC microcalorimeter from MicroCal Inc (Northampton, MA). The renatured and the native lysozymes were dialyzed overnight against 20 mm glycine, pH 2.5, and centrifuged for 30 min at 10,000 × g. The sample concentrations were 0.20 and 0.21 mg/ml, respectively, for the renatured and the native proteins. The samples were equilibrated at 25 °C, introduced into the cell, and incubated for 15 min at 25 °C and 27 p.s.i. before starting the up scan. The temperature range scanned was 25–80 °C, the rate of temperature change was 40 °C/h for both the up scans and the down scans, and the filter period was 20 s. A 1-min pause was introduced at the end of the up scan before starting the down scan. Three independent up scan/down scan experiments were performed with each protein. Each scan with a protein sample was preceded and followed by an identical scan with buffer to establish the base line. After each scan, the corresponding buffer base line was subtracted, and both the up scan and down scan were analyzed using the MicroCal-Origin software for VP-DSC supplied with the machine. Refolding kinetics were studied by CD at three different wavelengths (220, 222, and 228 nm) using a Jobin-Yvon (Longjumeau, France) CD6 spectropolarimeter. The observation cuvette was a cylindrical, 5 mm-path cell, and the sample holder was thermostated at 25 °C. The dead time needed to mix the solutions, fill the cuvette, and start the scan, was about 80 s and was taken into account for data processing. The integration time was 5 s, and the time interval was 10 s. Each experiment was repeated at least 3 times. The files were converted into ASCII files by the ISA/hda ASCII conversion subroutine of the CD6 software, and data processing was achieved by means of the program Fig.P version 2.7 for windows (Biosoft, Cambridge, UK). The signal of the denatured protein in renaturation buffer was calculated from its signal in 6 m GdnHCl as follows. The dependence of the signal on the GdnHCl concentration was accounted for by incubating HEWL in renaturation media containing GdnHCl at concentrations between 3.5 and 6 m, where the protein is completely unfolded. The ellipticities of these solutions were plottedversus the concentration of denaturant and fitted by a linear regression. The extrapolation of the fit to the GdnHCl concentration in the renaturation buffer was used as the signal of the denatured protein under these conditions. The fluorescence kinetics were recorded in a SPEX (Edison, NJ) Fluoromax spectrofluorometer. The recording time was 2–3 h, with a sampling interval of 10 s and an integration time of 5 s. 1 × 1-cm cuvettes were placed in a cell holder thermostated at 25 °C. The excitation band pass was 2.125 nm, and the emission band pass was 4.25 nm. The fluorescence of the denatured protein in the renaturation buffer was calculated as indicated for the CD experiment. The lysozyme was unfolded under non-reducing conditions in the presence of 6m GdnHCl and 0.1 m acetic acid, pH 2.5, and its concentration was adjusted to 8 mg/ml by addition of the same buffer. The CD stopped-flow apparatus used was as described by Chaffotteet al. (11Chaffotte A.-F. Guillou Y. Goldberg M.E. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 9694-9702Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). The stopped-flow module (reservoirs, syringes, mixers, and observation cell) were thermostated at 25 °C. The recording time was 2 s with a sampling period and an integration time of 1 ms. Renaturation was initiated upon mixing of 15 μl of denatured protein (small syringe) with the 585 μl of renaturation buffer (two large syringes). The mixing time was 75 ms, and the final concentration of lysozyme was 0.1 mg/ml. The experiment was repeated 50 times, and the accumulated kinetic data were averaged and analyzed as indicated above for the reduced lysozyme. The renaturation buffer used by Goldberg et al. (20Goldberg M.E. Rudolph R. Jaenicke R. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 2790-2797Crossref PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar) for renaturing reduced lysozyme at 25 °C was progressively optimized, taking into account the two following requirements. (i) Aggregation should be minimized at a lysozyme concentration (0.1 mg/ml) sufficient to give a detectable far UV CD signal. (ii) The disulfide exchange catalysts should not absorb too much light in the far UV so as to permit CD measurements in the 220-nm region. Based on the initial observation by Orsini and Goldberg (25Orsini G. Goldberg M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 3453-3458Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we used moderate concentrations of solubilizing or denaturing agents to minimize aggregation. Although urea and non-detergent sulfobetaines indeed drastically minimized aggregation during the refolding/reoxidation of reduced HEWL (26Goldberg M.E. Expert-Bezancon N. Vuillard L. Rabilloud T. Folding and Design. 1995; 1: 21-27Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), they could not be used because they absorb light strongly in the far UV. In contrast, GdnHCl absorbs much less in the wavelength range used for far UV CD measurements. Similarly, the classical thiol-disulfide couple described by Saxena and Wetlaufer (19Saxena V.P. Wetlaufer D.B. Biochemistry. 1970; 9: 5015-5022Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar) for the refolding of lysozyme (GSSG/GSH) strongly absorbs light in the far UV. Since GSH, the reduced form of glutathione, is in a 10-fold excess over GSSG, we replaced it by DTT which absorbs light much less in the far UV. By varying the GdnHCl, reduced DTT, and GSSG concentrations, we found that the optimal refolding buffer was 0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.2, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5 m GdnHCl, 60 μmGSSG, and 20 μm DTT, in which the yield of active HEWL was about 80% after 24 h of renaturation. The protein refolded under the conditions described above was characterized and compared with the native enzyme, using the following methods. Both native and refolded lysozyme were centrifuged to eliminate large aggregates and tested for activity. All the activity present in the renatured HEWL preparation (i.e. 74% of the initial activity of the native protein) was recovered in the supernatant, indicating that the aggregates contained only inactive molecules. Moreover the protein in the supernatant and native HEWL had similar specific activities (30,750 units/mg for the native and 29,310 units/mg for the renatured lysozyme in the supernatant). Therefore the renatured mixture contained about 25% of inactive aggregates that were removed by centrifugation and 75% of soluble fully active protein. To characterize further the renatured protein, the samples were analyzed on a gel filtration column (see “Experimental Procedures”). The two proteins had the same elution profile, with a major peak at a volume of 14.5 ml, which contained the protein, and a minor peak at 18 ml, which had an absorbance spectrum similar to that of glutathione. Hence, both native and renatured HEWL eluted in a peak at 14.5 ml, which indicated that they had the same Stokes radius. The proteins were also analyzed by analytical ultracentrifugation. The sedimentation profiles of the two proteins were similar, and the observed sedimentation coefficients were, within experimental error, identical, 2.03 ± 0.05s, for the native lysozyme, and 1.92 ± 0.05s, for the refolded lysozyme. Since both proteins also had identical Stokes radii, it could be concluded that the refolded protein is monomeric, like the native one, and has the same hydrodynamic properties. The renatured lysozyme was further characterized by CD and fluorescence. The CD spectra of the denatured and the native lysozyme were recorded between 190 and 260 nm. The two spectra were indistinguishable, with a minimum at around 208 nm. Hence the two enzymes have the same content in secondary structures. The emission fluorescence spectra recorded with an excitation wavelength of 295 nm were also superimposable and showed a maximum of intensity at 340 nm. To ascertain that no chemical change was introduced during denaturation or renaturation, samples of lysozyme at different stages of the unfolding/refolding process were analyzed by mass spectrometry. The mass spectra of native untreated lysozyme, native lysozyme incubated in renaturation buffer, reduced/denatured lysozyme, and refolded lysozyme had the same features. They all showed a major peak whose intensity was arbitrarily set to 100%, and minor peaks whose intensities were between 10 and 20%. Most of these minor peaks did not change in all the spectra. One, however, had the same mass increase upon reduction as the major peak. Its mass of 14,502 Da could not correspond to a lysozyme from which a part only of the signal sequence would have been removed. It might be a modified form of the enzyme that copurified during the industrial purification of HEWL. The mass of the major peak was 14,305 Da for the two native and the renatured lysozyme and 14,311 for the unfolded lysozyme. These values are similar to those expected for the oxidized (14,306 Da) and the reduced (14,314 Da) form of lysozyme, respectively. These results indicate that no chemical change was introduced upon denaturation/renaturation. The spectra obtained in D2O for the three samples exhibit similar features. 63 slowly exchanging amide protons were identified in the renatured lysozyme in agreement with previously published work on native lysozyme (24Redfield C. Dobson C.M. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 122-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). The NOESY spectrum is comparable to that obtained for the native lysozyme in the same conditions in terms of temperature and mixing time. Fig. 1 displays thed NN connectivities identified in the NOESY spectra for the renatured lysozyme. Extended region ofd NN connectivities are observed for residues 8 to 14/15, 27–38, and 92–100 in agreement with the presence of regular α-helices. Shorter stretches of d NNconnectivities are also observed for residues 40–42, 55–57, 75–78, 82–84, 111–112, and 123–125. These regions correspond either to non-regular helices or tight turns. Extended regions ofd aN sequential connectivities are also observed from residues 42–47, 50–55, and 57–60 in agreement with the presence of triple-stranded anti-parallel β-sheet (data not shown). 2P. Roux, M. E. Goldberg, A.-F. Chaffotte, and M. Delepierre, manuscript in preparation. The stability of the protein was tested using microcalorimetry. Whereas preliminary experiments made with native lysozyme at a scanning rate of 60 °C/min showed a significant difference (1.6 °C) between the transition temperatures observed for the up scan and the down scan, this difference was reduced to less than 1 °C at a scanning rate of 40 °C. With this slower rate, the transition curves of the renatured and the native lysozymes were practically superimposable. Thus, the transition temperatures obtained from the up scans were 58.5 ± 0.1 and 58.4 ± 0.1 °C for native and renatured lysozyme, respectively. The transition temperatures for the down scans were 57.5 ± 0.1 and 57.4 ± 0.1 °C, respectively, and the denaturation enthalpies were 107.6 ± 2.0 and 100.8 ± 1.8 kcal/mol, respectively. Although the differences in the denaturation enthalpies might seem experimentally significant, they could be accounted for by a 3% difference between the real and the measured relative protein concentrations of the two samples, which is well within the experimental error. Altogether, these results indicate that the thermodynamic properties of the renatured lysozyme are indistinguishable from those of the native enzyme, which confirms the identity of the conformations of both proteins. Nonetheless, it should be noted that the values found here for the T m are lower than the one found in the literature (T m = 64, 1 °C, see Ref. 27Privalov G. Kavina V. Freire E. Privalov P.L. Anal. Biochem. 1995; 232: 79-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). This difference could be due to an uncertainty in the pH value since the T m of lyso"

This enzyme activity is thought to be conferred by a complex of proteins residing in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), including a Glu-6-P translocase that transports Glu-6-P into the lumen of the ER, a phosphohydrolase catalytic subunit residing in the lumen, and putative glucose and inorganic phosphate transporters that allow exit of the products of the reaction. In this study, we have investigated the effect of adenovirus-mediated overexpression of the Glu-6-Pase catalytic subunit on glucose metabolism and insulin secretion, using a well differentiated insulinoma cell line, INS-1. We found that the overexpressed Glu-6-Pase catalytic subunit was normally glycosylated, correctly sorted to the ER, and caused a 10-fold increase in Glu-6-Pase enzymatic activity in in vitro assays. Consistent with these findings, a 4.2-fold increase in3H2O incorporation into glucose was observed in INS-1 cells treated with the recombinant adenovirus containing the Glu-6-Pase catalytic subunit cDNA (AdCMV-Glu-6-Pase). 3-[3H]Glucose usage was decreased by 32% in AdCMV-Glu-6-Pase-treated cells relative to controls, resulting in a proportional 30% decrease in glucose-stimulated insulin secretion. Our findings indicate that overexpression of the Glu-6-Pase catalytic subunit significantly impacts glucose metabolism and insulin secretion in islet β-cells. However, INS-1 cells treated with AdCMV-Glu-6-Pase do not exhibit the severe alterations of β-cell function and metabolism associated with islets from rodent models of obesity and non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, suggesting the involvement of genes in addition to the catalytic subunit of Glu-6-Pase in the etiology of such β-cell dysfunction.

In liver, Glu-6-Pase plays an important role in regulating glucose disposal and storage in concert with the opposing actions of the glucose-phosphorylating enzyme glucokinase. Glucokinase is also an important regulator of glucose metabolism and glucose-stimulated insulin secretion in β-cells of the islets of Langerhans (1Meglasson M.D. Matschinsky F.M. Diabetes Metab. Rev. 1986; 2: 163-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar, 2Newgard C.B. Diabetes Rev. 1996; 4: 191-206Google Scholar). The stimulation of insulin secretion by glucose is thought to be mediated by increases in the ATP:ADP ratio and closure of ATP-sensitive K+ channels (1Meglasson M.D. Matschinsky F.M. Diabetes Metab. Rev. 1986; 2: 163-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar, 3Newgard C.B. McGarry J.D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 689-719Crossref PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar). Glu-6-Pase has also been reported to be expressed in the islets of Langerhans (4Waddell I.D. Burchell A. Biochem. J. 1988; 255: 471-476Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), but measurements of enzyme activity have yielded conflicting results (4Waddell I.D. Burchell A. Biochem. J. 1988; 255: 471-476Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar,5Perales M.A. Sener A. Malaisse W.J. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1991; 101: 67-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), and the extent to which the enzyme participates in regulation of glucose flux in normal islets remains unresolved. Measurement of glucose formation and utilization in islets from an obese and insulin-resistant strain of rodents (the ob/ob mouse) has revealed a dramatically increased rate of incorporation of3H2O into glucose in such islets relative to those from normal lean animals (6Khan A. Chandramouli V. Ostenson C.-G. Ahren B.O. Schumann W.C. Low H. Landau B.R. Efendic S. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 9732-9734Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 7Khan A. Chandramouli V. Ostenson C.-G. Berggren P.-O. Low H. Landau B.R. Efendic S. Endocrinology. 1990; 126: 2413-2416Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Glucose-stimulated insulin secretion is disturbed in these and other genetic models of obesity and non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, and it has been suggested that active glucose recycling could contribute to the defect by causing increased consumption of ATP (7Khan A. Chandramouli V. Ostenson C.-G. Berggren P.-O. Low H. Landau B.R. Efendic S. Endocrinology. 1990; 126: 2413-2416Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). These metabolic studies have logically implied that the molecular basis for increased cycling in islets from ob/ob mice is enhanced expression of Glu-6-Pase (6Khan A. Chandramouli V. Ostenson C.-G.

Endocrinology. 1990; 126: 2413-2416Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), but older studies in which the activity of the enzyme was compared in ob/ob versus normal mice revealed less than a 2-fold increase (8Taljedal I.-B. Biochem. J. 1969; 114: 387-394Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), leaving unresolved the issue of the role of Glu-6-Pase expression in the activation of glucose recycling in the islet. Further uncertainty about the effect of Glu-6-Pase overexpression in islets is introduced by the molecular complexity of this enzyme system. Glu-6-Pase activity is thought to be imparted in the cell by a set of proteins residing in the endoplasmic reticulum (9Arion W.J. Lange A.J. Walls E.H. Ballas L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 10396-10406Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Included are a Glu-6-P translocase that transports Glu-6-P from the cytoplasm to the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum, the Glu-6-Pase catalytic subunit or phosphohydrolase that resides in the lumen, and putative proteins that transport glucose and inorganic phosphate back to the cytoplasm. The cDNAs encoding the phosphohydrolase catalytic component of Glu-6-Pase from mouse, human, and rat have recently been cloned (10Shelly L.L. Lei K.-J. Pan C.-J. Sakata S.F. Ruppert S. Schutz G.

Zomerschoe A.G. Voice M.W. Burchell A. Biochem J. 1992; 286: 173-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). To the extent that activities other than the phosphohydrolase component are rate-limiting for the system, overexpression of only the catalytic subunit may have limited metabolic impact. More recently, a survey of expression of a large panel of genes by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction in Zucker diabetic fatty (ZDF) rats revealed that the mRNA encoding the catalytic subunit of Glu-6-Pase is increased by approximately 43% in islets of prediabetic and by more than 5-fold in diabetic male ZDF animals relative to Zucker lean controls (14Tokuyama Y.

Impressively, Glu-6-Pase was one of only two genes among the 31 surveyed whose expression was increased in the obese and diabetic animals relative to controls. Like islets from ob/ob mice, those from ZDF rats have elevated rates of glucose usage and impaired regulation of insulin secretion (14Tokuyama Y. Sturis J. DePaoli A.M. Takeda J. Stoffel M. Tang J. Sun X. Polonsky K.S. Bell G.I. Diabetes. 1995; 44: 1447-1457Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 15Johnson J.H. Ogawa A. Chen L. Orci L. Newgard C.B. Alam T. Unger R.H.

Chem. 1995; 270: 1295-1299Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar), but it is as yet uncertain whether increased expression of the Glu-6-Pase transcript results in increased enzymatic activity within islet cells or contributes to the dysfunctional phenotype in any way. To address the issue of whether overexpression of the catalytic subunit of Glu-6-Pase is sufficient to activate glucose cycling and impair insulin secretion, we have used the recombinant adenovirus system to express this protein in the well differentiated INS-1 insulinoma cell line. We find that overexpression of the catalytic subunit of Glu-6-Pase in such cells has a clear metabolic impact and that impairment of glucose-stimulated insulin secretion is proportional to the resultant reduction in glycolytic flux. INS-1 cells were grown in RPMI 1640 medium containing 11 mm glucose, 10% fetal calf serum, 10 mm Hepes, 2 mm glutamine, 1 mmsodium pyruvate, 50 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 100 milliunits of penicillin, and 100 mg of streptomycin/ml (17Asafari M. Janjic D. Meda P. Li G. Halban P.A. Wollheim C.B. Endocrinology. 1992; 130: 167-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (1049) Google Scholar). Primary hepatocytes were prepared from 200–300-g male Wistar rats using the method of Massague and Guinovart (18Massague J. Guinovart J.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1978; 543: 269-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) and cultured as described previously (19O'Doherty R.M. Lehman D.L. Seoane J. Gómez-Foix A.M. Guinovart J.J. Newgard C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20524-20530Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). A recombinant adenovirus containing the cDNA encoding the rat Glu-6-Pase catalytic subunit (AdCMV-Glu-6-Pase) was prepared by methods described previously (20Becker T. Noel R. Coats W.S. Gómez-Foix A. Alam T. Gerard R.D. Newgard C.B. Methods Cell Biol. 1994; 43: 161-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (562) Google Scholar). A 1.4-kilobase KpnI/EcoRI fragment encompassing the entire protein coding region but none of the 5′-untranslated region of the Glu-6-Pase cDNA was ligated to 320 base pairs of the 5′-untranslated region of the rat islet glucokinase cDNA (21Hughes S.D. Quaade C. Milburn J.L. Cassidy L. Newgard C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 4521-4530Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and inserted into the adenovirus cloning plasmid pACCMV-pLpA (22Gómez-Foix A.M. Coats W.S. Baque S. Alam T. Gerard R.D. Newgard C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25129-25134Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). pACMV-pLpA containing the Glu-6-Pase cDNA was cotransfected with pJM17 plasmid (23McCrory W.J. Bautista D.S. Graham F.L. Virology. 1988; 163: 614-617Crossref PubMed Scopus (550) Google Scholar) into 293 cells. The resultant recombinant virus was plaque purified, amplified, and isolated by CsCl gradient centrifugation to produce stocks with titers of approximately 1010 virions/ml as described (20Becker T. Noel R. Coats W.S. Gómez-Foix A. Alam T. Gerard R.D. Newgard C.B. Methods Cell Biol. 1994; 43: 161-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (562) Google Scholar). Titering of the virus was accomplished by measuring the optical density of the viral solution at 260 nm, using a conversion factor of 1 × 1012virions/OD unit. INS-1 cells were left untreated or exposed to AdCMV-Glu-6-Pase or a control virus containing the β-galactosidase gene (AdCMV-β-gal; 24) for 1 h. In experiments with INS-1 cells, the viral incubation media was replaced with RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% fetal calf serum and 5 mm glucose for 40–48 h before the biochemical analyses described below. Isolated hepatocytes were treated with recombinant viruses as described previously (19O'Doherty R.M. Lehman D.L. Seoane J. Gómez-Foix A.M. Guinovart J.J. Newgard C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20524-20530Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Total RNA was prepared by the Triazol method (Life Technologies, Inc.) from INS-1 cells or hepatocytes. RNA was electrophoresed on a 1.2% formaldehyde-agarose gel, transferred to nitrocellulose, and hybridized to 32P-labeled Glu-6-Pase cDNA, prepared by the random primer method (25Feinberg A.P. Vogelstein B. Anal. Biochem. 1983; 132: 6-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (16651) Google Scholar). INS-1 cells were sonicated for 3–5 s in ice-cold homogenization buffer containing 20 mm Tris, pH 7.0, 150 mm KF, 5 mm EDTA, 250 mm sucrose, 10 mg/ml leupeptin, 1 mm benzamidine, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Homogenization of fresh liver samples was carried out in the same homogenization buffer but using a 15-s burst with a Brinkmann homogenizer. Cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 15 min, and the supernatant was recentrifuged at 105,000 × g for 60 min. In some experiments, the low speed pellet was resuspended in 150 μl of homogenization buffer and retained for analysis of Glu-6-Pase content. The 105,000 ×g microsomal pellet and supernatant fractions were recovered, the pellet resuspended in 150 μl of homogenization buffer, and the supernatant fraction concentrated to approximately the same volume. The resuspended low speed pellet, high speed pellet, and supernatant fractions were prepared for SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis by mixing with an equal volume of 50 mmTris, pH 7.0, 8 m urea, 1% SDS, and 5% β-mecaptoethanol and heating to 50 °C. Electrophoretically resolved proteins were transferred to Immobilon P membrane (Millipore) and reacted with a 1:1,000 dilution of a polyclonal antiserum against the rat Glu-6-Pase catalytic subunit (a gift from Dr. R. Taub, University of Pennsylvania; 26), and the blot was developed with ECL reagents (Amersham). Crude microsomes isolated from AdCMV-Glu-6-Pase-treated INS-1 cells or hepatocytes, or fresh liver harvested from a 24-h fasted rat, were pretreated with 1% Triton or 0.5% SDS on ice for 15 min and subsequently incubated for 10 min in 80 μl of 50 mm Tris, pH 7.0, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.2% SDS, 2 units/ml aprotinin, 2.5 mm4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluoride, 1 mg/ml antipain, and 0.5–1 unit of recombinant N-glycosidase F (Boehringer Mannheim). Control samples were treated in the same fashion except in the absence of N-glycosidase F. In other experiments, 2.5 mg/ml tunicamycin was added to the culture medium of AdCMV-Glu-6-Pase-treated INS-1 cells or hepatocytes to inhibit glycosylation. The presence or absence of N-linked oligosaccharides was evaluated on the basis of electrophoretic mobility of Glu-6-Pase as determined by SDS-polyacrylamide electrophoresis and immunoblot analysis (see above). Glu-6-Pase enzymatic activity was measured in microsomal fractions of INS-1 cells or liver by the inorganic phosphate release assay of Nordlie and Arion (27Nordlie R.C. Arion W.J. Methods Enzymol. 1966; 9: 619-625Crossref Scopus (301) Google Scholar), using an assay kit from Sigma. Measurements were performed in the presence of either 200 mm Glu-6-P or 200 mmMan-6-P. For insulin secretion experiments, untreated or AdCMV-Glu-6-Pase or AdCMV-β-gal-treated INS-1 cells were washed twice with secretion buffer containing 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 0.1 m NaCl, 4.5 mm KCl, 1.2 mm KH2PO4, 1.2 mm MgSO4, 25 mmNaHCO3, 2.5 mm CaCl2, 0.2% bovine serum albumin and preincubated with secretion buffer containing 2 mm glucose for 1 h at 37 °C with 95% O2 and 5% CO2. The preincubation medium was then replaced with secretion buffer containing varying glucose concentrations. After 3 h of incubation, the medium was collected and subjected to insulin radioimmunoassay, using the Coat-A-Count radioimmunoassay kit (Diagnostic Products Corporation, Los Angeles). Glucose usage in AdCMV-Glu-6-Pase or AdCMV-β-gal-treated INS-1 cells was assayed by incubation with 3- or 5-[3H] glucose and measurement of3H2O production as described previously (28Hughes S.D. Quaade C. Johnson J.H. Ferber S. Newgard C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15205-15212Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In separate assays, 3H2O incorporation into glucose was used to measure the rate of Glu-6-P dephosphorylation, using the method of Khan et al. (6Khan A. Chandramouli V. Ostenson C.-G. Ahren B.O. Schumann W.C. Low H. Landau B.R. Efendic S. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 9732-9734Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 7Khan A. Chandramouli V. Ostenson C.-G. Berggren P.-O. Low H. Landau B.R. Efendic S. Endocrinology. 1990; 126: 2413-2416Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), with some modifications. Briefly, approximately 1.5 × 106 INS-1 cells were incubated in Krebs-bicarbonate buffer with 0.5% bovine serum albumin, 5 mm or 15 mm glucose, and3H2O (1.25 mCi/100 μl medium; NEN Life Science Products). The reaction was terminated after 3 h of incubation at 37 °C by adding an equal volume of 10% perchloric acid followed by neutralization of the supernatant with 1 mKOH. The insoluble proteins, cell debris, and potassium perchlorate were removed by centrifugation. An aliquot of the supernatant was freeze dried twice and dissolved in Krebs-bicarbonate buffer with 15 mm glucose. The 3H-labeled glucose in the supernatant was then separated from other labeled media components by silica gel thin layer chromatography, using chloroform:acetic acid:H2O (30:35:5, v/v) as the mobile phase (29Ivanova V. Rouseva R. Kolarova M. Serkedjieva J. Rachev R. Manolova N. Prep. Biochem. 1994; 24: 83-97PubMed Google Scholar). Glucose was visualized by staining with a 0.2% solution of naphthoresorcinol (in ethanol) and 20% H2SO4 (1:1, v/v). The area of the thin layer chromatography plate staining positive for glucose was cut out, placed in scintillation fluid (Bio-Safe II, Research Products International), and counted. Lactate production in the medium was assayed as described (30Becker T.C. BeltrandelRio H. Noel R.J. Johnson J.H. Newgard C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21234-21238Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Statistical significance was calculated by t test with two samples assuming unequal variances using the Microsoft Excel program. Northern blot analysis was used to evaluate Glu-6-Pase catalytic subunit mRNA levels in INS-1 cells treated with various titers of the AdCMV-Glu-6-Pase recombinant adenovirus. The mRNA encoding the catalytic subunit of Glu-6-Pase was undetectable in untreated INS-1 cells or in INS-1 cells treated with the AdCMV-β-gal virus and harvested 48 h later. In contrast, a transcript of the size predicted from the Glu-6-Pase cDNA insert was readily detectable in INS-1 cells treated with AdCMV-Glu-6-Pase virus and was found to increase with increasing viral dose over a range from 4 to 20 × 109 virions/1.5 × 106 cells (Fig.1). To evaluate further the expressed Glu-6-Pase gene products, crude microsomes isolated from AdCMV-Glu-6-Pase-treated INS-1 cells were subjected to immunoblot analysis with an antibody raised against the rat Glu-6-Pase catalytic subunit (24Herz J. Gerard R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 2812-2816Crossref PubMed Scopus (504) Google Scholar). In the representative experiment shown in Fig. 2, the antibody detected very low levels of a protein of approximately 36,000 daltons in untreated or AdCMV-β-gal-treated INS-1 cells, although in other experiments, this band was not visible. Treatment of INS-1 cells with AdCMV-Glu-6-Pase caused a large increase in the expression of an immunodetectable protein of the same size as the native Glu-6-Pase gene product (Fig. 2 A). Although the fold increase in Glu-6-Pase expression in AdCMV-Glu-6-Pase-treated INS-1 cells could not be monitored accurately because of the low levels of Glu-6-Pase protein in the control cells, densitometric analysis revealed that INS-1 cells treated with 4 × 109 virions/1.5 × 106 cells (the lowest viral dose tested) contained 2.6 times as much microsomal Glu-6-Pase protein as found in microsomes isolated from liver of an overnight fasted rat, whereas INS-1 cells treated with 1 × 1010 or 2 × 1010virions/1.5 × 106 cells expressed 6.1- and 8.3-fold more Glu-6-Pase protein, respectively. Importantly, the recombinant Glu-6-Pase expressed in INS-1 cells was detected at the same electrophoretic position as the endogenous Glu-6-Pase expressed in liver microsomes isolated from a 24-h fasted rat (Fig.2 A). To determine whether the overexpressed Glu-6-Pase protein was retained appropriately in the microsomal fraction as expression levels were increased by AdCMV-Glu-6-Pase treatment, we performed subcellular fractionation experiments at a low and a high viral titer. Three simple fractions were evaluated: the pellet of the initial 12,000 × g spin, which should contain mitochondria and other cellular debris but relatively few microsomes; the microsomal pellet obtained by centrifugation at 105,000 ×g; and the supernatant fraction from this high speed spin. As can be seen in Fig. 2 B, immunodetectable Glu-6-Pase was increased in proportion to viral dose in the microsomal pellet fraction and was the fraction with highest Glu-6-Pase expression at both the low (4 × 109 virions/1.5 × 106 cells) and high (2 × 1010 virions/1.5 × 106 cells) titer. Very little Glu-6-Pase immunoreactivity was found in the high speed supernatant fraction at either viral titer, but a significant level was detected in the low speed pellet which increased with viral dose. It should be noted, however, that the percent of Glu-6-Pase found in the microsomal fraction was 63% at the low viral dose and 60% at the high dose, demonstrating that a similar proportion of the total Glu-6-Pase enzyme was found in microsomes for all conditions studied. We also evaluated the glycosylation state of the expressed protein by incubation of AdCMV-Glu-6-Pase-treated cells with the glycosylation inhibitor tunicamycin or by incubation of microsomes from AdCMV-Glu-6-Pase-treated cells with N-glycosidase F. Consistent with a recent report showing that Glu-6-Pase is glycosylated via an N-linked site (31Lei K.J. Pan C.J. Shelly L.L. Liu J.L. Chou J.Y. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 93: 1994-1999Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar), the Glu-6-Pase protein produced in AdCMV-Glu-6-Pase-treated INS-1 cells migrated at a higher apparent molecular weight than the protein expressed in tunicamycin-treated cells or from N-glycosidase F-treated microsomes (Fig.2 C). Immunodetectable, recombinant Glu-6-Pase from untreated and N-glycosidase F-treated INS-1 microsomes migrated identically with the endogenous Glu-6-Pase bands from untreated andN-glycosidase F-treated liver cells, respectively, indicating that the size of the oligosaccharide added to the recombinant protein in INS-1 cells is the same as that added to the native protein in normal liver (Fig. 2 C). The presence of appropriately glycosylated Glu-6-Pase in the microsomal fraction suggested that the recombinant enzyme was largely localized to the endoplasmic reticulum in AdCMV-Glu-6-Pase-treated INS-1 cells. As shown in Table I, crude microsomes from untreated or AdCMV-β-gal-treated INS-1 cells have no detectable Glu-6-Pase activity. Microsomes prepared from liver of 24-h fasted rats hydrolyzed Glu-6-P at a rate of 0.48 μmol/min/mg of microsomal protein. These same microsomes hydrolyzed Man-6-P at a rate of 0.22 μmol/min/mg of microsomal protein. Treatment of INS-1 cells with the intermediate titer of AdCMV-Glu-6-Pase (1 × 1010 virions/1.5 × 106 cells) resulted in Glu-6-P hydrolysis at a rate of 5.13 μmol/min/mg of microsomal protein and a corresponding Man-6-P dephosphorylating activity of 2.41 μmol/min/mg of microsomal protein. Thus, the ratio of Man-6-P to Glu-6-P dephosphorylation was approximately 47% for microsomes isolated either from fresh liver or AdCMV-Glu-6-Pase-treated INS-1 cells. Because Man-6-P is not dephosphorylated by Glu-6-Pase when it is contained in intact microsomes (9Arion W.J. Lange A.J. Walls E.H. Ballas L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 10396-10406Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), our findings suggest a similar degree of “leakiness” or latency in the two preparations, allowing direct comparison of enzyme activities. Consistent with this, freezing and thawing of the two microsomal preparations, a manipulation that would be expected to cause rupturing of intact microsomes, resulted in an increase in the dephosphorylation rate for Man-6-P to a level approximately 80% the rate measured with Glu-6-P (data not shown). We conclude that treatment of INS-1 cells with the intermediate titer of AdCMV-Glu-6-Pase virus resulted in a Glu-6-Pase enzyme activity approximately 10 times that found in fasted rat liver. We also measured total glucose phosphorylating activity in extracts from untreated and AdCMV-Glu-6-Pase-treated INS-1 cells with a previously described radioisotopic assay (19O'Doherty R.M.

We found that treatment with the AdCMV-Glu-6-Pase virus had no effect on glucose-phosphorylating capacity (105.6 ± 5.5 μmol/g of protein/h in untreated cellsversus 121.5 ± 10.0 μmol/g of protein/h in AdCMV-Glu-6-Pase-treated cells), indicating that the AdCMV-Glu-6-Pase virus allows us to manipulate specifically Glu-6-Pase activity in INS-1 cells without affecting glucose phosphorylation.Table IGlu-6-Pase activity in microsomal fractions from INS-1 cells and fresh liverSubstrateUntreated INS-1AdCMV-Glu-6Pase-treated INS-1Untreated fresh liverμmol/min/mgGlu-6-PND5.13 ± 0.60.48Man-6-PND2.41 ± 0.50.22Ratio Man-6-P: Glu-6-P (%)4746Microsomes were prepared from untreated INS-1 cells, AdCMV-Glu-6-Pase-treated INS-1 cells, and freshly isolated liver from fasted rats and used for measurement of Glu-6-Pase activity with either 200 mm Glu-6-P or 200 mm Man-6-P as substrate.

Therefore, we obtained a direct measure of the metabolic impact of overexpression of the catalytic subunit of Glu-6-Pase in INS-1 cells by assaying the incorporation of3H2O into glucose. 3H2O labels newly formed glucose primarily at the hexose phosphate isomerase reaction (6Khan A.

https://openalex.org/W2078163247,"The nature of the involvement of an intact NH2 terminus in the assembly of α-hemolysin ofStaphylococcus aureus was reinvestigated. For the first time, a deletion of the first four amino acids at the NH2terminus of α-hemolysin yielded a novel mutant that undergoes all of the conformational changes to form a lytic pore. The experimental evidence shows unequivocally that the mutant toxin forms heat- and sodium dodecyl sulfate-stable heptameric oligomers. The concentration required to achieve 50% lysis of red blood cells is around 58–116 ng/ml, and the time taken to achieve lysis to the same extent as that of intact toxin is considerably longer. Transmission electron microscopic studies also suggest that the pores formed by this deletion mutant are similar to those by the full-length toxin. This is in contrast to the previously reported 2- and 11-amino acid deletions that failed to proceed further from a presumed prefinal nonlytic pore to a lytic pore. Studies on the kinetics of assembly indicate that this mutant can form heat- and sodium dodecyl sulfate-stable oligomers as fast as full-length α-hemolysin but that pore opening is slowed down. The data strongly suggest that these amino acids (Ala-Asp-Ser-Asp) are involved in the final stages of assembly of α-hemolysin in target membranes.

The assembly of proteins into membranes is an intricate phenomenon in which these proteins undergo a large degree of conformational changes in exerting their biological functions. Ion channels (1Renaud K.J. Inman E.M. Fambrough D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 20491-20497Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), integral membrane proteins (2Chazin W.J. Nat. Struct.

Nature. 1996; 379: 311-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (1044) Google Scholar) are a few well known examples. Pore-forming toxins such as α-hemolysin of Staphylococcus aureus, streptolysin O ofStreptococcus pyogenes, aerolysin of Aeromonas hydrophila, and α-toxin of Clostridium septicum, secreted by several bacteria in water-soluble forms, also assemble spontaneously in target cell membranes to form transmembrane channels (4Parker M.W. Pattus F. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1993; 18: 391-395Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 5Alouf J.E. Geoffroy C. Alouf J.E. Freer J.H. Source Book of Bacterial Toxins.

Nature. 1994; 367: 292-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar). Unlike ion channels, membrane-associated proteins, and cell surface receptors, these pore-forming toxins do not have well defined stretches of hydrophobic amino acids in their sequences. The localized environment experienced by stretches of amino acids that insert into membranes appears to control the assembly and function of some of these toxins. Hence, a detailed study of such toxins would provide valuable information regarding the spatial and structural organization of the polypeptide chain segments that span the membrane bilayer. This would eventually lead to a better understanding of their mode of action as well as pave the way for the rational design of novel lytic molecules (7Engelman D.M. Science. 1996; 274: 1850-1851Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Among the molecules available for the study of such pore-forming toxins, α-hemolysin (α-HL) 1The abbreviations used are: α-HL, α-hemolysin; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; CAPS, 3-(cyclohexylamino)propanesulfonic acid; rRBC(s), rabbit red blood cell(s); IVTT, in vitrotranscription and translation.1The abbreviations used are: α-HL, α-hemolysin; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; CAPS, 3-(cyclohexylamino)propanesulfonic acid; rRBC(s), rabbit red blood cell(s); IVTT, in vitrotranscription and translation. ofS.aureus is a relatively small protein. It is therefore amenable for redesign of its functions (8Walker B. Kasianowicz J. Krishnasastry M. Bayley H. Prot. Eng. 1994; 7: 655-662Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). α-HL is a 293-amino acid polypeptide that binds to the target cells as a monomer, and the cell-bound monomers undergo extensive conformational changes to form a transmembrane pore. The pore formation takes place through a series of intermediates, and the activity of α-HL is critically dependent on intact NH2 and COOH termini. A deletion at the NH2 terminus of α-HL led to the formation of oligomers devoid of lytic property, whereas a deletion at the COOH terminus has resulted in a monomer that was deficient in its ability to oligomerize (9Walker B. Krishnasastry M. Zorn L. Bayley H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 21782-21786Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the recently reported crystal structure of α-HL heptamer, the NH2 terminus has been shown to form a latch that participates in interprotomer interactions (10Song L. Hobaugh M.R. Shustak C. Cheley S. Bayley H. Gouaux J.E. Science. 1996; 274: 1859-1866Crossref PubMed Scopus (1921) Google Scholar). The NH2-terminal segment was shown earlier to be accessible to site-specific chemical modification agents in three states, namely, monomer in solution, membrane-bound monomer, and membrane-bound heptamer (11Krishnasastry M. Walker B. Braha O. Bayley H. FEBS Lett. 1994; 356: 66-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). This observation appears to be consistent with the crystal structure of the heptamer. Yet how a well exposed segment controls the assembly and the role it plays during the pore formation still remain unexplored.To gain further insight into these questions, it is necessary to delineate the role of an intact NH2-terminal segment during pore formation. This can be accomplished by detailed biochemical and biophysical analyses of NH2-terminal deletion mutants of the toxin. Unfortunately, all of the NH2-terminal deletion mutants of α-HL known so far have not provided any significant information regarding the extent of the involvement of this segment in assembly and pore formation (9Walker B. Krishnasastry M. Zorn L. Bayley H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 21782-21786Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, in the absence of electron microscopic evidence, the status of oligomers formed by these deletion mutants remains open to alternate interpretations. In this paper we describe an NH2-terminal deletion mutant, which, for the first time, is capable of undergoing all of the conformational changes that are necessary to form a functional pore. The biochemical and electron microscopic evidence of the mutant clearly shows that it assembles as fast as the full-length α-HL but forms functional pores with altered kinetic behavior.MATERIALS AND METHODSS. aureus wood 46 strain was obtained from ATCC (10832); the other bacterial strains used were obtained from commercial sources. All restriction and modifying enzymes were purchased from New England Biolabs. The cloning, expression vectors, Taq DNA polymerase, and RNasin H were products of the Promega Corporation. Expression vector pET-23d(+) was obtained from Novagen. The expression vectors were modified to suit the experiments as described here. Protein estimations were carried out with the Bradford reagent (Bio-Rad) using ultrapure lipid-free bovine serum albumin (Sigma) as the standard. All hemolysis assays were carried out with freshly drawn blood from New Zealand White rabbits from the local animal facility. All other chemicals used were of analytical grade.Cloning of α-HL and α-HL(5–293)The genomic DNA ofS. aureus wood 46 strain was made according to Lema et al. (12Lema M.W. Brown A. Calkins J.H. J. Microbiol. Methods. 1994; 19: 167-172Crossref Scopus (12) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. The strategy for cloning the genes of α-HL and its mutant is shown in Fig.1. The α-HL gene was obtained by PCR amplification of the above genomic DNA using the 5′ primer 5′-AATCCTGTCGCTGccatggCAGATTCTGAT, which creates anNcoI site (shown in lowercase) just before the start of the polypeptide chain (shown in italics). The 3′ primer is same as reported earlier (13Walker B. Krishnasastry M. Zorn L. Kasianowicz J. Bayley H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 10902-10909Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The 26-amino acid hydrophobic leader sequence (5′ ls) as shown in Fig. 1 of the full-length α-HL was deleted for the present work. The α-HL gene was verified by screening several independent PCR isolates exploiting the unique internal restriction sites present in the gene. The deletion mutant α-HL(5–293) was constructed by shifting the ATG start codon down to the fourth amino acid (Asp) of the full-length α-HL (amino acid numbers are with respect to mature full-length α-HL as mentioned in Fig. 1), and the fifth amino acid is changed to alanine for efficient processing of fMet as per the NH2-end rule (14Hirel P.-H. Schmitter J.-M. Dessen P. Fayat G. Blanquet S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 8247-8251Crossref PubMed Scopus (663) Google Scholar, 15Lathrop B.K. Burack W.R. Biltonen R.L. Rule G.S. Protein Expression Purif. 1992; 3: 512-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 16Tobias J.W. Shrader T.E. Rocap G. Varchavsky A. Science. 1991; 254: 1374-1377Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar). The gene for the present deletion mutant was obtained by PCR amplification of the α-HL gene using the upper primer 5′-GCAGATTccatggCTAATATTAAAACCGG, which creates an NcoI site; the downstream primer is the same as that used for full-length α-HL as mentioned above. As a result of this approach, the deletion mutant carries a mutation at the fifth amino acid (i.e. Ile to Ala; I5A) so that the polypeptide has the sequence A5NIKTG … EEMTN293 (see Fig. 1 for numbering). The PCR-amplified fragments were first polished with Klenow polymerase followed by ligation at the SmaI site of pGEM-3Zf(+) vector. The inserts between NcoI and HindIII were removed from the pGEM-3Zf(+) for subcloning into an expression vector under the control of T7 promoter as described in Fig. 1. The pT7 plasmids containing the inserts were used for generation of [35S]Met-labeled proteins using coupled in vitro transcription and translation (IVTT) as well as for expression in JM109(DE3). At least four independent PCR isolates of the present deletion mutant were cloned into the expression vector to check the consistency of the data. The data presented here were obtained with PCR isolate α-HL(5–293)-4 (4 represents the isolate number used for all of the studies).Dideoxy SequencingThe sequence of the coding strand of the constructs in the expression vector was determined with an Applied Biosystems Prism model 377 automated DNA sequencer using T7 promoter and α-HL internal primers. The sequence was consistent with our cloning strategy and is in agreement with the changes reported earlier (13Walker B. Krishnasastry M. Zorn L. Kasianowicz J. Bayley H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 10902-10909Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Gray G.S. Kehoe M. Infect. Immun. 1984; 46: 615-618Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Only one mutation, R56K, was observed. Apart from being a conserved mutation it has been shown earlier that a replacement of Arg with Cys (R56C) at this position did not affect the binding or lytic properties of the full-length α-HL (18Walker B. Bayley H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23065-23071Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Hence, this change is considered insignificant for the present studies.Purification of α-HL and α-HL(5–293)The soluble forms of the respective toxins from various JM109(DE3) expression cultures were purified by standard protocols. Briefly, an overnight inoculum (10 ml) was prepared by picking a single colony from a freshly transformed plate. The inoculum was washed with LB-ampicillin to remove any secreted β-lactamase present in the medium before its addition to 2 liters of LB medium containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin. The culture was grown at 30 °C for 10–12 h. The cells were harvested by centrifugation at 2,000 × g for 20 min and lysed once with a French press at 6,000 p.s.i. The resultant cell lysate was centrifuged at 40,000 × g for 1 h and the supernatant treated with polyethyleneimine to a final concentration of 0.25%. The suspension was then left on ice for 15 min and clarified by centrifugation. The supernatant was dialyzed extensively at 4 °C against 10 mm sodium acetate, pH 5.2, by changing the buffer at least six times over a period of 2 days. The dialyzed supernatant containing the deletion mutant was loaded after clarification by centrifugation and purified on an S-Sepharose column preequilibrated with 10 mm sodium acetate, pH 5.2. The mutant typically eluted in the range of 160–220 mm NaCl. The S-Sepharose-purified proteins were then subjected to further purification by fast protein liquid chromatography on a Mono S column using the above buffer. The yield for the mutant is 0.2 mg/liter. The purity and presence of the mutant were checked routinely by SDS-PAGE (19Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206016) Google Scholar).Protein SequencingThe purified mutant was blotted onto a Problot polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore Corp.) using 10 mm CAPS, pH 11.0, as reported earlier (20Matsudiara P. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 182: 602-613Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). The blot was stained briefly with Ponceau S and destained overnight before sequencing. Edman degradation was performed with an Applied Biosystems model 476A sequencer using Fastblot cycles. The first 10 amino acids of the mutant were determined with good repetitive yields.In Vitro Transcription and Translation[35S]Met-labeled proteins were generated by in vitro transcription and translation (13Walker B. Krishnasastry M. Zorn L. Kasianowicz J. Bayley H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 10902-10909Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,18Walker B. Bayley H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23065-23071Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar), using the Escherichia coli T7 S30 extract system for circular DNA (L-1130, Promega). Briefly, supercoiled plasmid DNA (250 ng) was incubated with S30 premix (20 μl), T7 S30 extract (15 μl), amino acid mix minus methionine (5 μl), [35S]Met (1 μl of 15 μCi/μl) in the presence of RNasin H (1 μl/25 units), rifampicin (50 ng), and nuclease-free water to a final volume of 50 μl for 45 min at 37 °C. The samples were centrifuged immediately at 4 °C for 5 min at 16,000 × g, aliquoted, and stored at −70 °C for further use. Each aliquot was thawed and used immediately.Limited ProteolysisThe purified mutant (30 μg) was treated with 0.1 μg of proteinase K in water for 0, 2, 15, and 60 min. At the end of each time point, an aliquot was taken directly into a microcentrifuge tube containing 5 × Laemmli sample buffer and heated at 100 °C for 5 min. The samples were subjected to 14% SDS-PAGE, and the gel was stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue for visualization of the bands.Oligomerization with Deoxycholate and Heat StabilityThe mutant protein (1 mg/ml) was treated with 7 × 1-μl aliquots of 25 mm sodium deoxycholate in 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.2, at an interval of 10 min/μl with brief stirring to a final concentration of ∼6.5 mm. After the last addition the mixture was left for an additional 10 min at room temperature. At the end of the incubation period, the samples were mixed with Laemmli sample buffer and subjected to 8 and 10% SDS-PAGE.Hemolysis AssaysThe quantitative lysis of rabbit red blood cells (rRBCs) was measured by taking 1.8 μg of purified deletion mutant or α-HL in 1 ml of K-PBSA (150 mm NaCl, 20 mm KH2PO4, pH 7.4, containing 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin) in tube 1, out of which a 500-μl aliquot was 2-fold serially diluted in more than 15 tubes. An equal volume of 2% rRBCs was added to all of the tubes, which were left at 25 °C for 24 h in the case of mutant and for 30 min for the full-length toxin. At the end of the incubation period absorbance at 545 nm (hemoglobin release) was recorded against nonlytic supernatants of the last tubes.Kinetics of LysisThe time course was studied as reported earlier (18Walker B. Bayley H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23065-23071Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar) by incubating a known amount of toxin in 1 ml of 0.032% rRBCs. The light scattering at 595 nm was measured at regular intervals with gentle mixing to resuspend the sedimented rRBCs.Competitive HemolysisThe competitive hemolysis assay was performed by mixing the full-length toxin and the mutant in appropriate ratios in a 500-μl volume of K-PBSA. An equal volume of 2% rRBCs was then added and left at 25 °C for 30 min. At the end of incubation period, the absorbance at 545 nm was recorded. The absorbance (at 545 nm) obtained after suspending the rRBCs (1%) in 5 mmsodium phosphate buffer, pH 8.0, was taken as the 100% lysis value. The percentage of lysis for a given toxin ratio was calculated with respect to the 100% lysis value.Kinetics of Assembly of ToxinsIn these experiments freshly translated [35S]Met proteins (5 μl) were mixed with 5% rRBCs (25 μl), prepared as mentioned above, and at a given time point a 6-μl aliquot was withdrawn. The cells were then pelleted. The cell pellet was put directly in 20 μl of 1 × Laemmli sample buffer, incubated at 60 °C for 5 min, and subjected to 12% SDS-PAGE. After electrophoresis the gel was dried for autoradiography without fixing. The respective heptamer bands were analyzed further as reported earlier (11Krishnasastry M. Walker B. Braha O. Bayley H. FEBS Lett. 1994; 356: 66-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Briefly, after obtaining a suitable autoradiogram, the respective heptamer bands were excised from the dried gel and allowed to reswell in 1 × Laemmli sample buffer overnight. The samples were boiled at 95 °C for 10 min and electrophoresed as mentioned earlier with appropriate controls. Such an analysis confirmed that the heptameric bands are composed of constituent monomers of α-HL/mutants (data not shown).Electron Microscopy of α-HL and α-HL(5–293) PoresPurified full-length α-HL or α-HL(5–293), 30 μg in 50 μl, was incubated with an equal volume of 10% rRBCs and left for 24 h at 20 °C. Subsequently, the lysed rRBC membranes were collected by high speed centrifugation (16,000 × g) and washed extensively with 5 mm sodium phosphate, pH 8.0, several times. The membrane pellet was then resuspended in 50 μl of the same buffer. The samples for electron microscopy were prepared by placing a few microliters of the sample on a carbon-coated grid for 5 min, and the excess sample was removed with blotting paper. The grid was then stained for 1 min with freshly prepared 2% sodium phosphotungstic acid, pH 7.3, and examined in a JEOL transmission microscope.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONInitial observations of the NH2-terminal deletion mutant presented here, generated by the coupled in vitrotranscription and translation system, exhibited slow lysis of the rRBCs which is in contrast to an earlier observation (9Walker B. Krishnasastry M. Zorn L. Bayley H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 21782-21786Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To develop a conceptual framework about the assembly and function of pore-forming toxins, in particular α-HL, a detailed study of the NH2-terminal deletion mutant of α-HL becomes imperative. Hence, we have revisited the NH2-terminal part of α-HL with an aim to dissect further the mechanism of its assembly.Characterization of α-HL and α-HL(5–293) ToxinsThe cloning strategy depicted in Fig. 1 was different from the approach published earlier (13Walker B. Krishnasastry M. Zorn L. Kasianowicz J. Bayley H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 10902-10909Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and it readily yielded the desired construct. The DNA sequence of the construct is in agreement with earlier reports (13Walker B. Krishnasastry M. Zorn L. Kasianowicz J. Bayley H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 10902-10909Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Gray G.S. Kehoe M. Infect. Immun. 1984; 46: 615-618Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, the cloning strategy used is proven to be valid as the NH2-terminal sequence of the mutant was found to be ANIKTG as expected. All products of independent PCR isolates showed the same biological activities. The protein band corresponding to α-HL(5–293) was very prominent and migrated slightly ahead of α-HL on a 13-cm-long SDS-PAGE gel. To examine the overall folding of α-HL(5–293), both the mutant toxin and α-HL were digested with proteinase K, which cleaves α-HL at around the 130–135 position of the polypeptide yielding an approximate two halves of the toxin. Identical patterns were observed for both α-HL and α-HL(5–293). Hence, it can be concluded that the overall folding of α-HL(5–293) approximates that of α-HL.Properties of α-HL(5–293) Vis à Vis Native α-HLThe assembly and function of α-HL have been elucidated by several groups during the recent years (9Walker B. Krishnasastry M. Zorn L. Bayley H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 21782-21786Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13Walker B. Krishnasastry M. Zorn L. Kasianowicz J. Bayley H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 10902-10909Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 21Walker B. Krishnasastry M. Bayley H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5285-5292Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Based on these studies, a working model has emerged to explain the activity of α-HL. According to this model, the water-soluble toxin (stage 1) first binds to the rRBC membrane as a monomer (stage 2). The membrane-bound monomer then recruits other monomers in the membrane to form a heptameric prefinal pore (stage 3). This prefinal pore, however, is devoid of lytic property. Further conformational changes are required to form a functional lytic pore (stage4).Monomer insolution→1Membrane­boundmonomer→2Membrane­boundprefinal pore→3Functionalpore4MODEL1According to the current understanding of α-HL pore formation, intact NH2 and COOH termini are absolutely critical for the formation of a functional lytic pore (stage 4). Deletion of three amino acids at the COOH terminus arrests this toxin at stage2 (as a membrane-bound monomer), whereas deletion of two amino acids at the NH2 terminus arrests the toxin at stage3, which is unable to lyse the target cells (8Walker B. Kasianowicz J. Krishnasastry M. Bayley H. Prot. Eng. 1994; 7: 655-662Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Based on these observations it was concluded that an intact NH2terminus is an absolute requirement for the formation of a functional pore. However, the exact nature of the involvement of the NH2 terminus is not yet clear. Interestingly, the α-HL(5–293) presented here shows lytic properties similar to those of α-HL as judged by the criteria that follow.Oligomer PropertiesAlthough it is still debatable whether α-HL has specific receptors on rRBCs or not, it is well understood that α-HL homo-oligomers can be generated in vitro, by treatment of the toxin with sodium deoxycholate. The homo-oligomers formed by α-HL(5–293) after treatment with deoxycholate are depicted in Fig. 2 (panel B,lanes 1–4, and panel C, lanes 1–3). The oligomers of α-HL(5–293) exhibit properties of heat and SDS stability, similar to the oligomers of α-HL, which are characteristic features of the staphylococcal toxin. The α-HL(5–293) oligomer can withstand up to 80 °C (Fig. 2 B, lanes 2–4), and it dissociates to monomers only at or near 100 °C (Fig.2 C, lanes 1–3). This result confirms that the oligomers of α-HL(5–293) are similar to those of α-HL. At this juncture it is interesting to note that several oligomers of α-HL having single point mutations were stable only up to 50 °C in SDS (18Walker B. Bayley H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23065-23071Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar).Figure 2Expression of α-HL(5–293) in E. coli and its oligomer properties. Panel A, lane 1, the purified mutant (3 μg) was obtained as described under “Materials and Methods” on a 12% SDS gel. Panel B, the samples were put on an 8% SDS minigel.

Nakae T. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1984; 24: 319-322Crossref Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The quantity of α-HL(5–293) required for achieving 50% lysis was found to be about 58–116 ng/ml (Fig. 3). This value appears to be about ∼2–3-fold higher than that reported earlier for α-HL (∼30 ng/ml; Ref. 13Walker B. Krishnasastry M. Zorn L. Kasianowicz J. Bayley H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 10902-10909Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), but it is within the range of experimental error. The lysis pattern for α-HL(5–293) is linear and gradual, whereas it is sigmodial for α-HL at optimal concentrations (see Fig.4). α-HL has a shorter lag time (the time difference between the addition of toxin to rRBCs and observation of lysis), the same for α-HL(5–293) is much longer. The slow lysis could be for two reasons: (i) the intact NH2 terminus plays a major role in recruiting other subunits to form a prefinal pore,i.e. between stages 2 and 3, or (ii) it helps in conversion of the prefinal pore to a final functional pore,i.e. between stages 3 and 4. The data presented in the following paragraphs show that it plays a major role after the toxin assembles successfully into a prefinal pore. It is to mention here that the previously constructed mutants, i.e.α-HL(3–293) or α-HL(12–293), did not exhibit any lytic property (9Walker B. Krishnasastry M. Zorn L. Bayley H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 21782-21786Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, the deletion mutant, α-HL(3–293), was found to inhibit the slow lysis exhibited by a COOH-terminal deletion mutant (α-HL(1–290)). It is not yet known whether α-HL(3–293) can form at least ring-like structures or not. However, based on the electrophoretic migration, α-HL(3–293) was proposed to form a pentamer. Recently, the number of α-HL monomeric units present in the oligomer was revised from six to seven (23Gouaux J.E. Braha O. Hobaugh M.R. Song L. Cheley S. Shustak C. Bayley H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 12828-12831Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar), and hence, the earlier conclusion that the α-HL(3–293) mutant forms a pentameric structure is no longer tenable. As discussed later, data presented here clearly show that the oligomer of α-HL(5–293) comigrates with the oligomer of α-HL (see Fig. 6).Figure 3Comparison of quantitative hemolysis of α-HL and α-HL(5–293). The purified toxin (α-HL or α-HL(5–293)) in K-PBSA was 2-fold serially diluted to more than 15 tubes. An equal volume (500 μl) of 2% rRBCs was added to make up the volume to 1 ml. The concentration of the toxin present in the first tube was 900 ng/ml. The samples were incubated at room temperature for various times. At the end of the incubation period, the samples were centrifuged, and the absorbance at 545 nm was recorded against the supernatants of the last tubes. Open symbols (○ and ▿) represent α-HL at 30 min and 24 h, respectively. Filled symbols (• and ▾) represent α-HL(5–293) at 4 and 24 h, respectively. The quantity of α-HL(5–293) required to achieve 50% lysis of rRBC was recorded after about a 4-h incubation. The data presented here are an average of three independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image"

The secondary structure also depends on the binding of calcium, which causes an increase in α-helix and a decrease in β-sheet, as estimated by circular dichroism. The conformation of calexcitin is independent of ionic strength, and the calcium-induced structural transition is slightly inhibited by Mg2+ and low pH, while favored by high pH. The switch of calexcitin's secondary structure upon calcium binding, which was confirmed by intrinsic fluorescence spectroscopy and nondenaturing gel electrophoresis, is reversible and occurs in a physiologically meaningful range of Ca2+concentration. The calcium-bound form is more globular than the apoprotein. Unlike other EF-hand proteins, calexcitin's overall lipophilicity is not affected by calcium binding, as assessed by hydrophobic liquid chromatography. Preliminary results from patch-clamp experiments indicated that calcium is necessary for calexcitin to inhibit potassium channels and thus to increase membrane excitability.

CE is a protein kinase C substrate whose phosphorylation state increases 2–3-fold in the eye of the marine snail Hermissenda crassicornis after Pavlovian conditioning produced by the association of visual and vestibular stimuli. CE, as determined by immunoreactivity, has also been found in the central nervous systems of squid (5Nelson T.J. Yoshioka T. Toyoshima S. Han Y.-F. Alkon D.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Upon phosphorylation by protein kinase C (which is also inhibited in vitro by CE's binding of GTP), calexcitin translocates from the cytosol to the membrane. Microinjection of purifiedHermissenda or squid CE into Hermissenda or rabbit neurons causes the same increase in membrane excitability previously related to memory formation and retention (2Nelson T.J.

Although different proteins, such as cAMP-dependent protein kinase, protein kinase C, calmodulin, and others, have been implicated in learning-related phenomena (13Dudai Y.

Calexcitin presents the interesting property of binding both Ca2+ and GTP, whose signaling pathways are known to interact (18De Matteis M.A. Santini G. Kahn R.A. Di Tullio G. Luini A. Nature. 1993; 364: 818-821Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 19Jeng A.Y. Srivastava S.K. Lacal J.C. Blumberg P.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Several other post-translational modification consensus domains are also present on the amino acid sequence of CE, such as myristoylation, isoprenylation, and glycosylation (3Nelson T.J. Cavallaro S. Yi C.-L. McPhie D.L. Schreus B.G. Gusev P.A. Favit A. Zohar O. Kim J.-H. Beushausen S. Ascoli G. Olds J.L. Neve R. Alkon D.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 13808-13813Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). It is therefore tempting to propose that CE may be implicated in the molecular mechanisms of associative memory acquisition (in response to the temporal association of two or more sensory inputs) by providing a convergence between different cell signaling pathways (21Alkon D.L. Rasmussen H. Science. 1988; 239: 998-1005Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar, 22Alkon, D. L. (1989) Sci. Am., July 42–50Google Scholar, 23Alkon D.L. Behav. Brain Res. 1995; 66: 151-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). The molecular study of calexcitin has always been difficult because of the scarcity of the protein in neural tissues. After CE was recently cloned (3Nelson T.J. Cavallaro S. Yi C.-L. McPhie D.L. Schreus B.G. Gusev P.A. Favit A. Zohar O. Kim J.-H. Beushausen S. Ascoli G. Olds J.L. Neve R. Alkon D.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 13808-13813Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), larger amounts could be expressed in Escherichia coli, allowing a spectroscopic analysis of the protein. To characterize the structure-activity relationship for CE, we studied its secondary structure by CD, FT-IR, intrinsic fluorescence, hydrophobic chromatography, and nondenaturing gel electrophoresis. We report here that calcium binding causes a conformational switch for calexcitin and suggest that such a structural transition may be relevant for the biochemical mechanisms underlying the cellular pathways of memory acquisition. Twenty liters of Luria-Bertani broth containing ampicillin (100 mg/liter) were incubated with E. coli BL21(DE3) cells which had been transformed with a pET-16b expression vector (Novagen, Inc., New York, NY) containing the sequence for the CE protein, a factor X proteolytic site and an oligohistidine tail (3Nelson T.J. Cavallaro S. Yi C.-L. McPhie D.L. Schreus B.G. Gusev P.A. Favit A. Zohar O. Kim J.-H. Beushausen S. Ascoli G. Olds J.L. Neve R. Alkon D.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 13808-13813Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Cells were grown at 37 °C to mid-log phase, and CE expression was induced by adding the activator isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (1 mmfinal). After 3 h, bacteria were collected by gentle centrifugation (3000 × g, Sorvall), suspended in 100 ml of loading buffer (0.5 m NaCl, 20 mmTris/HCl, pH 7.9, 0.5 mm Iz, 20 mg/liter pepstatin, 20 mg/liter leupeptin, 10 mg/liter aprotinin A, 0.5 mm PMSF), and stored at −80 °C. Upon partial thawing, the cells were homogenized at 0 °C by sonication and centrifuged (100,000 × g, Beckman) at 4 °C. Pellets were resuspended in 100 ml of loading buffer and recentrifuged. Pooled supernatants were divided into three batches and loaded onto a His-Tag column (15 ml, Novagen Inc., water-jacketed at 8 °C, flow rate 2.5 ml/min), previously charged with an excess of NiCl2. The column was washed with 150 ml of loading buffer followed by 150 ml of the same buffer with 25 mm Iz. The column was developed with eluting buffer (same as above with 0.5m Iz) and stripped with 0.1 m EDTA. Fractions were subjected to gel electrophoresis and Western blot analysis with standard procedures (6Kim C.S. Han Y.-F. Etcheberrigaray R. Nelson T.J. Olds J.L. Yoshioka T. Alkon D.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 3060-3064Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 24Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Mariatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual.2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar), using a polyclonal antibody raised against a 26-amino acid (see Fig. 2) synthetic peptide (3Nelson T.J. Cavallaro S. Yi C.-L. McPhie D.L. Schreus B.G. Gusev P.A. Favit A. Zohar O. Kim J.-H. Beushausen S. Ascoli G. Olds J.L. Neve R. Alkon D.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 13808-13813Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The antibody, recognizing natural squid and cloned E. coli CE, was tested by antigen preabsorption and prebleed antiserum controls (24Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Mariatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual.2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Fractions containing CE were pooled together, desalted at 8 °C by ultrafiltration and concentrated down to 10 ml. For all the ultrafiltration and desalting steps described in this report, the filtration membrane (Centriprep/Centricon, Amicon, Beverly, MA) was preincubated with bovine serum albumin and extensively washed with water prior to usage. Upon concentration, some precipitation occurred, and the sample was centrifuged and filtered before the next chromatographic step. IMAC-HPLC was performed with a MC-Poros system (PerSeptive Biosystems, Cambridge, MA) at room temperature with a flow rate of 5 ml/min. The perfusion column (100 × 4.6 mm, 20-mm particle diameter) was charged with 25 column volumes of 0.2 m NiSO4or NiCl2, and equilibrated in loading buffer (until the base line was stable) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. The column was tested before each preparation by injecting two solutions containing, respectively, 20 and 100 μg of commercial horse heart myoglobin, and washing the column with 10 column volumes of 0.5 mm Iz followed by 5 column volumes of eluting buffer (50 mm Iz). The calexcitin-containing samples from the previous step were injected onto the column in loop (2 ml), and loading buffer was passed through until the base line stabilized. The column was developed with a linear gradient from loading to eluting buffer in 15 min, using optically pure Iz (Sigma) to avoid interference with the following spectroscopic analyses. Fractions containing CE were pooled together, concentrated to 0.5 mg/ml, and aliquoted (50 μl) for prolonged storage at −80 °C. For several experiments, calexcitin was proteolyzed to remove the oligohistidine chain from the protein N terminus. Fifty micrograms of purified CE in 180 μl of water were mixed with 5 μg of activated factor X (bovine ImmunoPure grade, Pierce) in 3 μl of buffer (5 mm Tris/HCl, pH 6.0, 0.5 m NaCl, 1 mm benzamidine hydrochloride). The solution was incubated at room temperature for 2 h, and the reaction was stopped by dilution with protease inhibitor mixture (20 mg/liter leupeptin, 10 mg/liter aprotinin A, 0.5 mm PMSF) and two passages through a 50-kDa cutoff ultrafiltration membrane to eliminate factor Xa (25Aurell L. Friberger P. Karsson G. Claeson G. Thromb. Res. 1977; 11: 595-609Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar,26Nagai K. Th⊘gersen H.C. Nature. 1984; 309: 810-812Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). The resulting mixture was repurified by IMAC-HPLC. Reacted CE (without the oligohistidine tail) was recovered in the void volume, while unreacted CE eluted on the Iz gradient. Samples of CE were collected, desalted, concentrated, and stored at −80 °C. Optic lobes from fresh squid (Loligo pealei, Calamari Inc., Woods Hole, MA) were dissected, frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −80 °C. Two batches of 400 squid optic lobes (approximately 120 g) were high speed homogenized (Polytron, Switzerland, setting 5) at 4 °C in 150 ml of Hermissenda buffer (50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 20 mg/liter leupeptin, 10 mg/liter aprotinin A, 0.5 mm PMSF, 0.2m dithiothreitol), followed by sonication. The suspension was centrifuged for 2 h at 4 °C (150,000 × g, Beckman), and the pellets were resuspended in 150 ml ofHermissenda buffer and centrifuged. Combined supernatants were passed through a 50-kDa cutoff ultrafiltration membrane and applied onto a medium pressure, preparative weak anion-exchange column (Pharmacia, Uppsala, Sweden, 50 × 3 cm, fast-flow DEAE-Sepharose, Sigma), water-jacketed at 8 °C. The flow rate was maintained at 1.5 ml/min during the loading and the washing (water, 12 h). The retained fraction was eluted isocratically at 6 ml/min with 1m potassium acetate buffer (pH 7.4), extensively desalted (final ionic strength <30 mm), and loaded onto a Cibacron blue-agarose column (25 × 2 cm, constant flow rate of 2.5 ml/min, Sigma), water-jacketed at 8 °C. After 7 h of washing, the column was developed with 1 m potassium acetate buffer (pH 7.4), and the retained fraction was desalted and concentrated down to 10 ml. This sample was divided in two aliquots and injected in loop (5 ml) on a semipreparative AX-300 HPLC (1 × 25 cm, 30-mm gel particle diameter, Thomson, Springfield, VA), equipped with an AX-300 Guardagel precolumn (Thomson, 2.5 × 1 cm). The column was eluted at 2 ml/min and 8 °C with a linear gradient of 0–0.6 mpotassium acetate buffer (pH 7.4) for 20 min followed by 0.6m buffer for 30 min and 1 m buffer for 10 min. The chromatograms were analyzed by Western blot of 1-ml fractions. CE-containing fractions were pooled, desalted, concentrated, and aliquoted at −80 °C. Spectra were acquired with the ion-spray ionization technique on a Perkin-Elmer API III Plus mass spectrometer (Sciex Co., Thornill, ONT, Canada). The experimental parameters for cation mode were: ion-spray voltage, 5.5 kV; orifice voltage, 90 V; scan range (m/z), 500–2000; scan rate, 10.5 ms/atomic mass unit; no interscan delay; resolution, >1 atomic mass unit. The stock solution of purified cloned CE was diluted 1:1 with acetonitrile containing 0.1% formic acid and 1% HCl, and delivered to the ion-spray source by infusion using a syringe pump (model 22, Harvard Apparatus, Inc., South Natick, MA). Computation for secondary structure prediction was performed remotely using a multiple sequence alignment algorithm (Sopma) available on the internet (e.g. http://dot.imgen.bcm.tmc; [email protected]). Default parameters were selected, and a simple query of percentage of α, β, and other structures was submitted to maximize reliability and accuracy (evaluated as 81% for each component) (27Geourjon C. Deleage G. Protein Eng. 1994; 7: 157-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar, 28Geourjon C. Deleage G. Comput. Appl. Biosci. 1995; 11: 681-684PubMed Google Scholar). Infrared spectra were recorded by using a Perkin-Elmer 1760 FT-IR spectrophotometer, equipped with a TGS detector and a Perkin-Elmer model 7300 computer. The instrument was continuously purged with dry air for 15 min before data collection and during measurements to eliminate water vapor absorption. For each sample, 128 interferograms were recorded, averaged, and Fourier transformed to produce a spectrum with a nominal resolution of 4 cm−1. Dried films were prepared by spreading 10 μl of the protein solutions (1.7, 0.85, 0.43, and 0.21 mg/ml) on BaF2 supports and slowly evaporating the water in a dry chamber at 25 °C for 3 h. The analysis of the protein aqueous solution (5% w/w) was performed by placing 4 μl between two discs of BaF2 using a Teflon spacer 9.3 mm thick. Spectra of the buffer were recorded in the same cell under the same instrumental conditions as the sample spectra. Difference spectra were generated by an interactive difference routine to subtract the appropriate solvent spectrum from the spectrum of each protein solution. Subtraction of water was considered appropriate when it yielded a flat baseline from 1900 to 1720 cm−1, avoiding negative side lobes, and when it removed the water band near 2130 cm−1. The procedure of spectra processing for quantitative analysis by the deconvolution method has been described previously (29Bramanti E. Bramanti R. Stiavetti P. Benedetti E. J. Chemometrics. 1994; 8: 409-421Crossref Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 30Bramanti E. Benedetti E.

(1997) Biopolymers , 41, in pressGoogle Scholar); the fit standard errors estimated between x-ray and infrared secondary structure values are 2.5% for α-helix, 7.16% for β structures, and 5.1% for other components (turns and coils). Vacuum UV-CD spectra were recorded over the range of 178 to 260 nm using either Jasco J720, Jasco J700, or Jasco J600 spectropolarimeter (Jasco Instruments, Tokyo, Japan). Measurements were made in triplicate using a 0.01-cm quartz disassemblable cell (V = 20 μl), or a 0.02 cm quartz water-jacketed cell (V = 15 μl) at 15 °C. Cells were rinsed with water extensively before each measurement, and the chamber was equilibrated with dry N2 (15 liters/min). The instrumental parameters were: scan rate, 10 nm/min; time constant (J600 only), 3 s; spectral slit width, 1 nm. All blanks were recorded in the same conditions and subtracted from the sample spectra. Solutions were prepared at 0 °C by diluting 5 μl of a freshly thawed purified CE aliquot with 5 μl of protease inhibitor mixture and 5 μl of water or calcium buffer (final protein concentration around 0.15 mg/ml). The pH was checked after every addition of the calcium buffer, and adjusted to pH 7.5 (Tris/HCl) in the few instances when this was necessary. Calcium buffer concentrations were calculated (taking into account all the interactions between Ca2+, Mg2+, H+, and EGTA) (32Portzehl I.L. Caldwell P.C. Ruegg J.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1964; 79: 581-591PubMed Google Scholar) using the EGTA software written by T. J. N. and available by anonymous FTP in binary mode at las1.ninds.nih.gov in the pub/dos directory. The exact protein concentration of the solutions (necessary to obtain secondary structures from CD spectra) was determined both spectrophotometrically (A 279 measured on a Varian Cary 4E double-ray spectrophotometer) and with the bicinchoninic acid assay (33Smith P.K. Krohn R.I. Hermason G.T. Mallia A.K. Gartner F.H. Provenzano M.D. Fujimoto E.K. Goeke N.M. Olson B.J. Klenk D.C. Anal.

Spectra were cut at 180 or 182 nm and analyzed by single-value decomposition with the Varsel software (34Hennessey Jr., J.P. Johnson Jr., W.C. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 1085-1094Crossref PubMed Scopus (574) Google Scholar, 35Johnson Jr., W.C. Methods Enzymol. 1992; 210: 426-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) running on a Unix machine (SGI PI-4D20 with Irix 4.01). The complete basis of 33 proteins was used in 528 subgroups of 31 elements each, and the search was optimized to reduce fit standard errors using protein concentration as a variable parameter. Intrinsic fluorescence measurements were obtained in triplicate at room temperature using a Spex Fluorolog-2 spectrofluorimeter with dm-3000 software (Spex Industries, Inc., Edison, NJ). The experimental parameters were excitation wavelength, 279 nm; scan range, 300–400 nm; speed, 10 nm/min. The instrument was calibrated with 1 mmfluorescein, according to the manufacturer's protocol. Protein solutions were recovered from CD analysis, diluted with protease inhibitor mixture, and buffered with 1 mm calcium to 3 ml in a 1-cm quartz cell (final protein concentration, 0.03 mg/ml). Phenyl-Sepharose chromatography was performed at room temperature using 2 ml of CL4-B resin (Sigma) packed in a 5-ml polypropylene column (Pharmacia, Uppsala, Sweden). Purified CE (85 μl, 112 ng) was loaded and eluted at a constant flow rate of 0.5 ml/min, collecting 1-ml fractions for dot-blot analysis. A pair of parallel elutions were run in triplicate, with Tris-buffered saline modified with 2 mm calcium and 2 mmEDTA, respectively. The column was washed with 20 ml of 6 murea and equilibrated with native mobile phase. Nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was performed using a precasted 4–20% gradient gel (Novex, San Diego, CA), with SDS- and β-mercaptoethanol-free running and sample buffers. The gel was electroblotted onto an unmodified nitrocellulose membrane (Pierce) with a semidry apparatus (6Kim C.S. Han Y.-F. Etcheberrigaray R. Nelson T.J. Olds J.L. Yoshioka T. Alkon D.L. Proc.

Line 3652 of human skin fibroblasts from young control (Coriell Cell Repositories, Camden, NJ) was seeded (∼5 cells/mm2) in 35-mm Nunc Petri dishes in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.), supplemented with 10% calf serum. The cells were used for patch-clamp experiments (at 21–23 °C) 3–5 days after seeding (3Nelson T.J. Cavallaro S. Yi C.-L. McPhie D.L. Schreus B.G. Gusev P.A. Favit A. Zohar O. Kim J.-H. Beushausen S.

Pipettes were made from Blue Tip capillary tubes (inside diameter, 1.1–1.2 mm) and filled with 140 mm KCl, 0.01 EGTA, 1 mm MgCl2, 10 mm HEPES/Na, pH = 7.4. Pipette resistances were ∼7 megohms. Records were obtained using an Axopatch-1D amplifier, stored on tape (Toshiba, PCM video recorder), and digitized at 2 kHz (interface Digidata 1200). Single-channel data acquisition and analysis were performed with pClamp 6. Amplifier, interface, and software were obtained from Axon Instruments (Foster City, CA). To study the secondary structure of a protein by spectroscopic methods such as CD, fluorescence or FT-IR, it is necessary to obtain an extremely pure sample to eliminate incorrect deconvolution of the experimental data due to impurities or optical interferences. The standard isolation procedure for cloned calexcitin (3Nelson T.J. Cavallaro S. Yi C.-L. McPhie D.L. Schreus B.G. Gusev P.A. Favit A. Zohar O. Kim J.-H. Beushausen S. Ascoli G. Olds J.L. Neve R.

The overall protocol yielded an average of 0.5 mg of CE from 20 liters of medium. The protein was over 99% pure by densitometric analysis of silver stained gel electrophoresis (Fig.1 A). When the sample was left for several hours at room temperature (in conditions similar to those used for spectroscopic analysis), a faint, new band (∼16 kDa) appeared on the gel below the CE band (∼25 kDa, in good agreement with the calculated value of 24.5 kDa for the cloned fused protein). This low molecular weight band, which accounted for less than 5% of the main CE band, possibly corresponded to a degradation product of CE, as suggested by the immunoreactivity on Western blot (Fig.1 B). The purification protocol for squid CE yielded only 1–10 μg of protein per preparation, with a purity of ∼60%. Therefore this sample could not be used for spectroscopic studies. When the fused oligohistidine tail was enzymatically removed from cloned CE, the product had a molecular weight corresponding to the natural squid protein (Fig. 1, C and D). The reaction was stopped after 2 h to avoid CE degradation, with 50% of the protein remainin"
https://openalex.org/W2126762193,"The involvement of basic residues of interleukin(IL)-8 receptors in coupling to the Gi and G16 proteins was investigated by using a series of IL-8 receptor mutants. Substitution of the basic amino acids in the third inner loop of the receptor does not alter the abilities of the receptor mutants to activate recombinant Gα16 or phosphoinositide-specific phospholipase C (PLC) β2 expressed in COS-7 cells. However, an IL-8 receptor mutant with double mutations at residues Lys158 and Arg159of the second inner loop loses its abilities to activate Gα16 but retains its ability to activate PLC β2. The activation of PLC β2 by an IL-8 receptor that is sensitive to pertussis toxin has been previously demonstrated to be mediated through Gβγ. Surprisingly, the IL-8 receptor mutants with substitution of Ala for either residue Lys158 or Arg159 can still activate Gα16, which suggests that either of the two basic residues in the second inner loop of the IL-8 receptor is sufficient for Gα16 coupling. The involvement of basic residues of interleukin(IL)-8 receptors in coupling to the Gi and G16 proteins was investigated by using a series of IL-8 receptor mutants.

Many biologically active molecules transduce their signals through specific cell-surface receptors.

Molecular cloning has revealed the existence of genes encoding at least 20 Gα, 5 Gβ, and 12 Gγ subunits in mammals (3Simon M.I. Strathman M.P. Gautum M. Science. 1991; 252: 802-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (1574) Google Scholar). These subunits can form a variety of heterotrimers that serve to connect specific cell surface receptors to a large number of different effectors including at least 4 PLC β isoforms and many adenylyl cyclases, as well as several specific ion channels (1Birnbaumer L. Abramowitz J. Brown A.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 90: 163-224Crossref Scopus (958) Google Scholar, 2Gilman A.G. Annu. Rev.

One of the intriguing questions posed by this apparent complexity is how signal transduction circuits are organized so that different kinds of receptors can be connected to effectors through various G proteins and coordinate a variety of responses in a large number of different cells. The specificity of some of the circuits is determined no doubt by developmental regulation of the expression of genes that encode the receptors, G proteins and effectors. In addition, subcellular localization may contribute to the specificity to a certain extent. However, the primary determinant for formation of a specific signal transduction circuit lies in specific protein-protein interactions.Work has been done to understand the molecular basis of the specificity in receptor-G protein interactions (4Hedin K.E. Duerson K. Clapham D.E. Cell. Signalling. 1993; 5: 505-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Amino acid sequences that are involved in activation of Gαq have been mapped to the third cytoplasmic (inner) loops of the α1B-adrenergic receptor, the m1 muscarinic receptor, and the glutamate receptors by using various chimeras (5Lechleiter J.

Although these sequences share no significant amino acid sequence homology, they appear to be different from the sequences involved in activating Gαs (8Wong S.K.-F. Parker E.M. Ross E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 6219-6224Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9Kosugi S. Okajima F. Ban T. Hidaka A. Shenker A. Kohn L.D. J. Biol.

Recently, we have found that different α1B-adrenergic receptor sequences are involved in coupling to different α subunits of the Gq class (10Wu D. Jiang H. Simon M.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9828-9832Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Furthermore, receptor sequences in other inner loops have also been implicated in the involvement of G protein coupling. Studies using receptor-derived peptides have implicated that the second inner loop of the N-formyl peptide receptor may be involved in G protein interaction (11Schreiber R.E. Prossnitz E.R. Ye R.D. Cohrane C.G. Bokoch G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 326-331Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Bommakanti R.K. Dratz E.A. Siemsen D.W. Jesaitis A.J. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 6720-6728Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar).We have previously demonstrated that the IL-8 receptor (IL-8R), like many other chemoattractant receptors including the C5a and formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine receptors, can couple to both G16 and Gi proteins (14Wu D. LaRosa G.J. Simon M.I. Science. 1993; 261: 101-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). In this report, we will report our investigation of the IL-8R sequences involved in coupling to G16 but not to Gi by site-directed mutagenesis. Our results indicate that two basic amino acid residues in the second inner loop of the IL-8R are essential for coupling to Gα16 but not to Gi, whereas the basic residues in the third inner loop are not required for coupling to either Gi or G16.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONThe IL-8 receptors were previously shown to couple to two G proteins, Gi and G16 (14Wu D. LaRosa G.J. Simon M.I. Science. 1993; 261: 101-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). To investigate whether different receptor sequences are involved in coupling to these two G proteins, we have generated a series of mutated receptors as tabulated in Fig.1. Since it was postulated that theBBXXB (B stands for basic amino acid, andX stands for any amino acid) motif might be responsible for Gi coupling (15Okamato T. Katada T. Ogata E. Nishimoto I. Cell. 1990; 62: 709-717Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar), we first investigated whether the BBBXXBmotif (residues Lys247 to Arg251) in the third intracellular loop of the human type B IL-8 receptor is involved in Gi coupling. We constructed the IL-8 receptor mutants, m1, m2, and m3, by substitution of Ala residues for the amino acids Lys246, His247, and Arg248, respectively. These mutants were tested for their abilities to couple to Gi and G16 in a previously established transient transfection assay (10Wu D. Jiang H. Simon M.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9828-9832Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 14Wu D. LaRosa G.J. Simon M.I.

Chem. 1996; 271: 13430-13434Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) to characterize the G protein-coupling specificity for the IL-8 receptors. The COS-7 cells used in the assay system do not contain endogenous IL-8 receptors, PLC β2, or Gα16, although they contain Gi2 and PLC β1 (13Wu D. Lee C.H. Rhee S.G. Simon M.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 1811-1817Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14Wu D. LaRosa G.J. Simon M.I. Science. 1993; 261: 101-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar, 17Wu D. Katz A.

Nature. 1992; 360: 686-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar). Thus, IL-8 did not elicit any significant elevation of IP levels in cells expressing the IL-8 receptor and its mutants in the absence of Gα16 or PLC β2 (Fig.2 A). To test the G16 coupling of the IL-8 receptor mutants, we cotransfected COS-7 cells with cDNAs encoding Gα16 and the IL-8 receptor or its mutants, and IL-8-induced accumulation of IPs was determined. As shown in Fig.2 B, IL-8 induced marked PTx-resistant accumulation of IPs in cells coexpressing Gα16 and the IL-8 receptor or its mutants, m1, m2, or m3, which suggests that these three IL-8 receptor mutants, like the wild-type IL-8 receptor, can still couple to Gα16. To test the Gi coupling, we cotransfected COS-7 cells with the cDNAs encoding PLC β2 and the receptors. The IL-8 receptor was previously shown to couple to endogenous Gi proteins of COS-7 cells to release Gβγ, which then activates recombinant PLC β2 (14Wu D. LaRosa G.J. Simon M.I. Science. 1993; 261: 101-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig.2 C, there was clear IL-8-induced accumulation of IPs in cells coexpressing PLC β2 and the IL-8 receptor, m1, m2, or m3, and the ligand-induced responses were mostly PTx-sensitive. Therefore, these data indicate that the IL-8 receptor mutants can couple to both G16 and Gi in transfected COS-7 cells. To test further the importance of the triple basic amino acids in the third inner loop of the IL-8 receptor, these basic amino acids (Lys246-His247-Arg248) were mutated to three alanine residues. As shown in Fig. 2, B andC, the IL-8R mutant can still couple to recombinant Gα16 and to PLC β2 via endogenous Gi proteins. Thus, it is clear that theBBBXXB (residues Lys247 to Arg251) motif at the N-terminal end of the third intracellular loop of the IL-8 receptor is by no means involved in the Gi coupling or the G16 coupling.Another basic amino acid residue in the third inner loop, Lys240, was also investigated for its involvement in coupling to G16 or Gi. We constructed the mutant m5 by substitution of an Ala residue for the residue Lys240. The mutant m5 was subjected to the same tests as m1–4. The tests showed that m5, like the others, can couple to G16 and Gi. Thus, we conclude that the basic residues inside the third inner loop of the human type B IL-8 receptor are not involved in coupling to G16 or Gi.Search of the IL-8 receptor sequence revealed a BBXXXB(Lys158-Lys163) motif in the second inner loop of the receptor. To test whether the basic residue doublet (Lys158-Arg159) is involved in the G protein coupling, we replaced the doublet with two Ala residues creating the mutant m8 (Fig. 1). By testing the mutant in the same cotransfection assay, we found that m8 can induce IP accumulation only in cells coexpressing PLC β2 (Fig.3 B) but not in those coexpressing Gα16 (Fig. 3 A), which suggests that m8 can couple only to Gi but not to Gα16. Neither m6 nor m7, which have substitution of an Ala residue for one of the basic residue doublets, loses its ability to couple to Gα16 (Fig. 3). The ability of m8 to activate PLC β2 has eliminated the possibility that the mutations in m8 greatly changed the conformation of the receptor. Nevertheless, we also did the ligand-binding assay with 125I-IL-8. The expression level of m8 and its affinity for IL-8 are similar to those of the wild-type IL-8 receptor, m6 and m7 (Fig. 1). In addition, we also determined the expression levels of Gα16 in cells coexpressing m8, m6, m7 and the wild-type IL-8 receptor. No major differences were noticed (Fig. 3 C). Therefore, it is reasonable to conclude that either of the basic residues (Lys158 and Arg159) is apparently sufficient to retain the ability of the receptor to couple to G16 and that the presence of either of them is essential for the G16 coupling, although these two residues do not appear to play a significant role in the Gi coupling.Figure 3Effects of mutations in the second inner loop of IL-8R on G protein coupling. COS-7 cells were cotransfected with cDNA encoding β-galactosidase (LacZ), the wild-type IL-8 receptor (IL-8R) or its mutants (m6–8), and cDNA encoding Gα16 (panels Aand C) or PLC β2 (panel B). The cells were treated with (dashed lines) or without (solid lines) 500 ng/ml PTx for 4 h. Then, the levels of IPs in COS-7 cells were determined 20 min after addition of IL-8 (10 n m). The data are presented as means ± S.D., and IL-8-induced accumulation of IPs in cells expressing the wild-type IL-8R was taken as 100% (panel A). The basal level (in the absence of ligand) is about 2300 dpm, and the ligand induced an increase of 4900 dpm in cells expressing the wild-type receptor and Gα16. Extracts from mock transfected cells (lane 1) and cells expressing IL-8R (lane 2), m6 (lane 3), m7 (lane 4), and m8 (lane 5) were also analyzed by Western blotting with a Gα16-specific antibody (panel C).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)We have previously demonstrated that different α1-adrenergic receptor sequences are involved in coupling to Gαq/11 and Gα14. However, sequences involved in Gα16 coupling have not been elucidated. Recent reports (18Wu D. Kuang Y. Wu Y. Jiang H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16008-16010Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 21Offermanns S. Simon M.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15175-15180Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar) shows that Gα16 appears to be promiscuous in its coupling to various receptors. Almost all of the G protein-coupled receptors thus far tested, including Gq-, Gi-, and Gs-coupling receptors, can couple to Gα16 in transfected COS-7 cells (18Wu D. Kuang Y. Wu Y. Jiang H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16008-16010Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 21Offermanns S. Simon M.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15175-15180Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar). This coupling promiscuity suggests that most G protein-coupling receptors possess the sequence elements and/or conformation required for interaction with and activation of Gα16. Our results provide an insight into what the requirements are. The basic residues Lys158 and Arg159 may constitute the sequence that interacts with and/or activates Gα16 or may be critical for formation of the receptor conformation required for coupling with Gα16. More studies (knowledge of the three-dimensional structure of the receptor) are needed to understand exactly how these two basic residues are involved in Gα16 coupling. Our data also indicate that the BBXXB motif in the third loop of IL-8R is not essential for either Gαi or Gα16 coupling. These data are consistent with the observation that residue Met241 in the third loop, as well as other non-charged amino acid residues in the second loop of IL-8R, are involved in coupling to Gαi2 (22Damaj B.B. McColl S.R. Neote K. Ogborn K.T. Hebert C.A. Naccache P.H. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 1426-1434Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar).Receptor consensus sequences for G protein-coupling were being pursued vigorously in the past. No such sequences have, however, been identified. Therefore, it is now generally believed that each individual receptor possesses specific receptor coupling elements, which were mostly found in the third inner loops of various receptors. Gα16 is an intriguing subunit. It lacks receptor coupling specificity; it couples to various G protein-coupling receptors ranging from Gs to Gi and Gq-coupling receptors. We have been looking for the receptor elements that are required for Gα16 coupling in both α1B-adrenergic receptors (10Wu D. Jiang H. Simon M.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9828-9832Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), but these elements have been eluding us until we identified the dual basic amino acids in the second loop of the IL-8 receptor. Although we did not identify consensus sequences for G16 coupling, our results are of great significance. 1) These results unequivocally prove that the second loop is involved in G protein-coupling specificity in contrast to most other studies, which usually only implicate the third inner loops. 2) This is the first time that Gα16-coupling elements have been identified. 3) The element required for Gα16 coupling is not required for Gαi coupling. 4) The basic residues in the second and third inner loops, which have been widely believed to be involved in Gi coupling, are not important for Gi coupling by the IL-8 receptor. Therefore, this work provides us with a better understanding of the specific interactions between receptors and G proteins. In addition, the receptor mutants that show limited yet defined G protein-coupling specificity would be useful in determining the specific in vivo function of signal transduction pathways mediated by specific receptors and G proteins. Many biologically active molecules transduce their signals through specific cell-surface receptors. Some of the receptors interact with heterotrimeric GTP-binding proteins (G proteins) 1The abbreviations used are: G protein, heterotrimeric GTP-binding protein; IP, inositol phosphate; IL-8, interleukin-8; IL-8R, IL-8 receptor; PLC, phosphoinositide-specific phospholipase C; PTx, pertussis toxin.1The abbreviations used are: G protein, heterotrimeric GTP-binding protein; IP, inositol phosphate; IL-8, interleukin-8; IL-8R, IL-8 receptor; PLC, phosphoinositide-specific phospholipase C; PTx, pertussis toxin.

Molecular cloning has revealed the existence of genes encoding at least 20 Gα, 5 Gβ, and 12 Gγ subunits in mammals (3Simon M.I. Strathman M.P. Gautum M. Science. 1991; 252: 802-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (1574) Google Scholar). These subunits can form a variety of heterotrimers that serve to connect specific cell surface receptors to a large number of different effectors including at least 4 PLC β isoforms and many adenylyl cyclases, as well as several specific ion channels (1Birnbaumer L.

One of the intriguing questions posed by this apparent complexity is how signal transduction circuits are organized so that different kinds of receptors can be connected to effectors through various G proteins and coordinate a variety of responses in a large number of different cells. The specificity of some of the circuits is determined no doubt by developmental regulation of the expression of genes that encode the receptors, G proteins and effectors. In addition, subcellular localization may contribute to the specificity to a certain extent. However, the primary determinant for formation of a specific signal transduction circuit lies in specific protein-protein interactions. Work has been done to understand the molecular basis of the specificity in receptor-G protein interactions (4Hedin K.E. Duerson K. Clapham D.E. Cell. Signalling. 1993; 5: 505-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Amino acid sequences that are involved in activation of Gαq have been mapped to the third cytoplasmic (inner) loops of the α1B-adrenergic receptor, the m1 muscarinic receptor, and the glutamate receptors by using various chimeras (5Lechleiter J.

Although these sequences share no significant amino acid sequence homology, they appear to be different from the sequences involved in activating Gαs (8Wong S.K.-F. Parker E.M. Ross E.M. J. Biol.

Recently, we have found that different α1B-adrenergic receptor sequences are involved in coupling to different α subunits of the Gq class (10Wu D. Jiang H. Simon M.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9828-9832Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Furthermore, receptor sequences in other inner loops have also been implicated in the involvement of G protein coupling. Studies using receptor-derived peptides have implicated that the second inner loop of the N-formyl peptide receptor may be involved in G protein interaction (11Schreiber R.E. Prossnitz E.R. Ye R.D.

Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 6720-6728Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). We have previously demonstrated that the IL-8 receptor (IL-8R), like many other chemoattractant receptors including the C5a and formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine receptors, can couple to both G16 and Gi proteins (14Wu D. LaRosa G.J. Simon M.I. Science. 1993; 261: 101-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). In this report, we will report our investigation of the IL-8R sequences involved in coupling to G16 but not to Gi by site-directed mutagenesis. Our results indicate that two basic amino acid residues in the second inner loop of the IL-8R are essential for coupling to Gα16 but not to Gi, whereas the basic residues in the third inner loop are not required for coupling to either Gi or G16. RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONThe IL-8 receptors were previously shown to couple to two G proteins, Gi and G16 (14Wu D. LaRosa G.J. Simon M.I. Science. 1993; 261: 101-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). To investigate whether different receptor sequences are involved in coupling to these two G proteins, we have generated a series of mutated receptors as tabulated in Fig.1. Since it was postulated that theBBXXB (B stands for basic amino acid, andX stands for any amino acid) motif might be responsible for Gi coupling (15Okamato T. Katada T. Ogata E. Nishimoto I. Cell. 1990; 62: 709-717Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar), we first investigated whether the BBBXXBmotif (residues Lys247 to Arg251) in the third intracellular loop of the human type B IL-8 receptor is involved in Gi coupling. We constructed the IL-8 receptor mutants, m1, m2, and m3, by substitution of Ala residues for the amino acids Lys246, His247, and Arg248, respectively. These mutants were tested for their abilities to couple to Gi and G16 in a previously established transient transfection assay (10Wu D. Jiang H. Simon M.I. J. Biol.

The COS-7 cells used in the assay system do not contain endogenous IL-8 receptors, PLC β2, or Gα16, although they contain Gi2 and PLC β1 (13Wu D. Lee C.H. Rhee S.G. Simon M.I. J. Biol.

Thus, IL-8 did not elicit any significant elevation of IP levels in cells expressing the IL-8 receptor and its mutants in the absence of Gα16 or PLC β2 (Fig.2 A). To test the G16 coupling of the IL-8 receptor mutants, we cotransfected COS-7 cells with cDNAs encoding Gα16 and the IL-8 receptor or its mutants, and IL-8-induced accumulation of IPs was determined. As shown in Fig.2 B, IL-8 induced marked PTx-resistant accumulation of IPs in cells coexpressing Gα16 and the IL-8 receptor or its mutants, m1, m2, or m3, which suggests that these three IL-8 receptor mutants, like the wild-type IL-8 receptor, can still couple to Gα16. To test the Gi coupling, we cotransfected COS-7 cells with the cDNAs encoding PLC β2 and the receptors. The IL-8 receptor was previously shown to couple to endogenous Gi proteins of COS-7 cells to release Gβγ, which then activates recombinant PLC β2 (14Wu D. LaRosa G.J. Simon M.I. Science. 1993; 261: 101-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig.2 C, there was clear IL-8-induced accumulation of IPs in cells coexpressing PLC β2 and the IL-8 receptor, m1, m2, or m3, and the ligand-induced responses were mostly PTx-sensitive. Therefore, these data indicate that the IL-8 receptor mutants can couple to both G16 and Gi in transfected COS-7 cells. To test further the importance of the triple basic amino acids in the third inner loop of the IL-8 receptor, these basic amino acids (Lys246-His247-Arg248) were mutated to three alanine residues. As shown in Fig. 2, B andC, the IL-8R mutant can still couple to recombinant Gα16 and to PLC β2 via endogenous Gi proteins. Thus, it is clear that theBBBXXB (residues Lys247 to Arg251) motif at the N-terminal end of the third intracellular loop of the IL-8 receptor is by no means involved in the Gi coupling or the G16 coupling.Another basic amino acid residue in the third inner loop, Lys240, was also investigated for its involvement in coupling to G16 or Gi. We constructed the mutant m5 by substitution of an Ala residue for the residue Lys240. The mutant m5 was subjected to the same tests as m1–4. The tests showed that m5, like the others, can couple to G16 and Gi. Thus, we conclude that the basic residues inside the third inner loop of the human type B IL-8 receptor are not involved in coupling to G16 or Gi.Search of the IL-8 receptor sequence revealed a BBXXXB(Lys158-Lys163) motif in the second inner loop of the receptor. To test whether the basic residue doublet (Lys158-Arg159) is involved in the G protein coupling, we replaced the doublet with two Ala residues creating the mutant m8 (Fig. 1). By testing the mutant in the same cotransfection assay, we found that m8 can induce IP accumulation only in cells coexpressing PLC β2 (Fig.3 B) but not in those coexpressing Gα16 (Fig. 3 A), which suggests that m8 can couple only to Gi but not to Gα16. Neither m6 nor m7, which have substitution of an Ala residue for one of the basic residue doublets, loses its ability to couple to Gα16 (Fig. 3). The ability of m8 to activate PLC β2 has eliminated the possibility that the mutations in m8 greatly changed the conformation of the receptor. Nevertheless, we also did the ligand-binding assay with 125I-IL-8. The expression level of m8 and its affinity for IL-8 are similar to those of the wild-type IL-8 receptor, m6 and m7 (Fig. 1). In addition, we also determined the expression levels of Gα16 in cells coexpressing m8, m6, m7 and the wild-type IL-8 receptor. No major differences were noticed (Fig. 3 C). Therefore, it is reasonable to conclude that either of the basic residues (Lys158 and Arg159) is apparently sufficient to retain the ability of the receptor to couple to G16 and that the presence of either of them is essential for the G16 coupling, although these two residues do not appear to play a significant role in the Gi coupling.We have previously demonstrated that different α1-adrenergic receptor sequences are involved in coupling to Gαq/11 and Gα14. However, sequences involved in Gα16 coupling have not been elucidated. Recent reports (18Wu D. Kuang Y. Wu Y. Jiang H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16008-16010Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 21Offermanns S. Simon M.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15175-15180Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar) shows that Gα16 appears to be promiscuous in its coupling to various receptors. Almost all of the G protein-coupled receptors thus far tested, including Gq-, Gi-, and Gs-coupling receptors, can couple to Gα16 in transfected COS-7 cells (18Wu D. Kuang Y. Wu Y. Jiang H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16008-16010Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 21Offermanns S. Simon M.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15175-15180Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar). This coupling promiscuity suggests that most G protein-coupling receptors possess the sequence elements and/or conformation required for interaction with and activation of Gα16. Our results provide an insight into what the requirements are. The basic residues Lys158 and Arg159 may constitute the sequence that interacts with and/or activates Gα16 or may be critical for formation of the receptor conformation required for coupling with Gα16. More studies (knowledge of the three-dimensional structure of the receptor) are needed to understand exactly how these two basic residues are involved in Gα16 coupling. Our data also indicate that the BBXXB motif in the third loop of IL-8R is not essential for either Gαi or Gα16 coupling. These data are consistent with the observation that residue Met241 in the third loop, as well as other non-charged amino acid residues in the second loop of IL-8R, are involved in coupling to Gαi2 (22Damaj B.B. McColl S.R. Neote K. Ogborn K.T. Hebert C.A. Naccache P.H. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 1426-1434Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar).Receptor consensus sequences for G protein-coupling were being pursued vigorously in the past. No such sequences have, however, been identified. Therefore, it is now generally believed that each individual receptor possesses specific receptor coupling elements, which were mostly found in the third inner loops of various receptors. Gα16 is an intriguing subunit. It lacks receptor coupling specificity; it couples to various G protein-coupling receptors ranging from Gs to Gi and Gq-coupling receptors. We have been looking for the receptor elements that are required for Gα16 coupling in both α1B-adrenergic receptors (10Wu D. Jiang H. Simon M.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9828-9832Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), but these elements have been eluding us until we identified the dual basic amino acids in the second loop of the IL-8 receptor. Although we did not identify consensus sequences for G16 coupling, our results are of great significance. 1) These results unequivocally prove that the second loop is involved in G protein-coupling specificity in contrast to most other studies, which usually only implicate the third inner loops. 2) This is the first time that Gα16-coupling elements have been identified. 3) The element required for Gα16 coupling is not required for Gαi coupling. 4) The basic residues in the second and third inner loops, which have been widely believed to be involved in Gi coupling, are not important for Gi coupling by the IL-8 receptor. Therefore, this work provides us with a better understanding of the specific interactions between receptors and G proteins. In addition, the receptor mutants that show limited yet defined G protein-coupling specificity would be useful in determining the specific in vivo function of signal transduction pathways mediated by specific receptors and G proteins. The IL-8 receptors were previously shown to couple to two G proteins, Gi and G16 (14Wu D. LaRosa G.J. Simon M.I. Science. 1993; 261: 101-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). To investigate whether different receptor sequences are involved in coupling to these two G proteins, we have generated a series of mutated receptors as tabulated in Fig.1. Since it was postulated that theBBXXB (B stands for basic amino acid, andX stands for any amino acid) motif might be responsible for Gi coupling (15Okamato T. Katada T. Ogata E. Nishimoto I. Cell. 1990; 62: 709-717Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar), we first investigated whether the BBBXXBmotif (residues Lys247 to Arg251) in the third intracellular loop of the human type B IL-8 receptor is involved in Gi coupling. We constructed the IL-8 receptor mutants, m1, m2, and m3, by substitution of Ala residues for the amino acids Lys246, His247, and Arg248, respectively. These mutants were tested for their abilities to couple to Gi and G16 in a previously established transient transfection assay (10Wu D. Jiang H. Simon M.I. J. Biol.

The COS-7 cells used in the assay system do not contain endogenous IL-8 receptors, PLC β2, or Gα16, although they contain Gi2 and PLC β1 (13Wu D. Lee C.H. Rhee S.G. Simon M.I. J. Biol.

In this study, we investigated the voltage-dependent action of DHPs with mutants of the IIIS6 and IVS6 segments of a cardiac calcium channel. Tyrosine residues in both motifs (Tyr1178 and Tyr1489) strongly contributed to the action of DHP agonists and antagonists. When these two sites were mutated, the communication between the voltage sensor and the DHP interaction site(s) was substantially impaired. In contrast, mutants of a nearby Ile (Ile1182) had much less influence on DHP agonist and antagonist interaction, and the voltage dependence of DHP antagonists was very similar to that of the wild type. The effect of a mutating of Ile1182, on agonist or antagonist action, however, depended strongly on the type of amino acid change. When Ile1182 was substituted with alanine, small changes were noted for DHP agonist and antagonist action. Changing this site into phenylalanine, however, significantly decreased the action of the DHP antagonist. These data show that Ile1182 can preferentially interact with DHP antagonists, but has a lesser contribution in agonist interaction. Thus, even though the agonist and antagonist interaction sites for DHPs with L-type calcium channels may overlap, some amino acids in this site may exhibit a preference for either DHP enantiomers.

A further confirmation of the binding site of 1,4-dihydropyridines arose from a chimera approach (13Tang S. Yatani A. Bahinski A. Mori Y. Schwartz A. Neuron. 1993; 11: 1013-1021Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). The DHP sensitivity of the α1C subunits was lost when part of the IVS6 segment was replaced by the corresponding but not totally equivalent portion of the DHP-insensitive α1A subunit (25Mori Y. Friedrich T. Kim M.S. Mikami A. Ruth P. Bosse E. Hofmann F. Flockerzi V. Furuichi T Mikoshiba K. Imoto K. Tanabe T. Numa S. Nature. 1991; 350: 398-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (704) Google Scholar). This approach also showed that part of the IIIS6 transmembrane domain previously noted as a “primary site” for DHP photoaffinity labeling (10Nakayama H. Taki M. Striessnig J. Glossmann H.

However, this study revealed that “different” sections of IVS6 seem to be involved in DHP agonist action and DHP antagonist action (13Tang S. Yatani A. Bahinski A. Mori Y. Schwartz A. Neuron. 1993; 11: 1013-1021Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). A similar strategy using “constructive chimeras” between α1C and α1A identified IIIS5, IIIS6, the connecting linker segment as well as IVS5-IVS6 and part of the IVS6 as elements of the DHP binding site (15Grabner M. Wang Z. Hering S. Striessnig J. Glossmann H. Neuron. 1996; 16: 207-218Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). This work also agreed with the data of our laboratory (13Tang S. Yatani A. Bahinski A. Mori Y. Schwartz A. Neuron. 1993; 11: 1013-1021Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) in that different portions of IVS6 appear to be involved in DHP agonist and antagonist binding action (15Grabner M. Wang Z. Hering S. Striessnig J. Glossmann H. Neuron. 1996; 16: 207-218Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar).Further, recent advances using a combination of chimera approach and site-directed mutagenesis revealed individual amino acids that may be critical for DHP binding (16Peterson B.Z. Tanabe T.N. Catterall W.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5293-5296Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 17Schuster A. Lacinova L. Klugbauer N. Ito H. Birnbaumer L. Hofmann F. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2365-2370Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Peterson et al. (16Peterson B.Z. Tanabe T.N. Catterall W.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5293-5296Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar) found that the outermost 60% of the IIIS6 and IVS6 transmembrane segments of the α1S are critical determinants of high affinity DHP binding. A tyrosine and two isoleucine residues in IIIS6 arranged in a YIXXI segment and a tyrosine, methionine, and two isoleucines in a YM(X)5I sequence in IVS6 were found to contribute to the DHP receptor site. Interestingly, in motif IIIS6, the important tyrosine residue believed to be involved in DHP action is conserved between DHP-sensitive and DHP-insensitive channels. A somewhat similar finding was made for the cardiac α1C subunit (17Schuster A. Lacinova L. Klugbauer N. Ito H. Birnbaumer L. Hofmann F. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2365-2370Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar), although in the latter only IVS6 was thoroughly tested by mutagenesis studies, and the amino acids that contribute to the DHP interaction site are almost identical with those published by Peterson et al. (16Peterson B.Z. Tanabe T.N. Catterall W.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5293-5296Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar), with the exception that these authors (17Schuster A. Lacinova L. Klugbauer N. Ito H. Birnbaumer L. Hofmann F. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2365-2370Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar) attributed less importance to the tyrosine residues.Recent studies (19Mitterdorfer J. Wang Z. Sinnegger M.J.

Chem. 1997; 272: 2629-2631Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) point to the importance of the IIIS5 motif in the contribution of DHP sensitivity in cardiac calcium channels. Mutation of a threonine residue in IIIS5 (Thr1066) into tyrosine (which is a natural substitution in the α1A “P/Q-type channel”) rendered the construct totally insensitive to DHP agonist and antagonist action (19Mitterdorfer J.

Mikala G. Schwartz A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2629-2631Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Similar to the functional electrophysiological studies, no DHP antagonist radioligand binding was detected with this mutant (20He M. Bodi I. Mikala G. Schwartz A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2629-2631Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Further, it has been shown that Thr1066 and Glu1070 are not only crucial for DHP sensitivity but also display different effects for DHP agonist and antagonist action. Thr1066 appears to be involved in mediating the DHP antagonist function, whereas the DHP agonist function requires the presence of both Thr1066 and Glu1070(19Mitterdorfer J. Wang Z. Sinnegger M.J. Hering S. Striessnig J. Grabner M. Glossmann H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30330-30335Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar).Altogether, these results show the involvement of a number of amino acid residues in the IIIS5, IIIS6, and IVS6 transmembrane segments of the cardiac calcium channel in the formation of the DHP binding/action site. These data, of course, do not eliminate the involvement of other motifs.The extent of DHP block of the L-type calcium channel depends on the holding potential, becoming more “efficient” in the inactivated state (27Bean B.P.

Res. 1989; 64: 338-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), which is represented by more depolarized potentials. The studies of Peterson et al. (16Peterson B.Z. Tanabe T.N. Catterall W.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5293-5296Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar) were done at zero membrane potential using radioligand DHP binding. The work of Schuster et al. (17Schuster A. Lacinova L. Klugbauer N. Ito H. Birnbaumer L. Hofmann F. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2365-2370Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar) employed electrophysiological methodologies; therefore, it is possible that different experimental conditions may account for the discrepancies; i.e. in one case binding to membranes yields accurate K d values; in the other case, electrophysiological data provide relative pharmacological “potency,” and the two may not be the same. These findings prompted us to investigate point mutants of α1Cin IIIS6 and IVS6, required for high affinity interaction of DHPs, with a special emphasis on voltage dependence of DHP action.DISCUSSIONSeveral point mutations (Y1178A, I1182A, I1182F, and Y1489I) in IIIS6 and IVS6 transmembrane segments of the cardiac calcium channel were tested for their involvement in the well known voltage-dependent action of dihydropyridines. Mutations Y1178A and Y1489I had a great influence on the agonist action of (+)-S-202–791 at a holding potential of −80 or −30 mV. The EC50 increased by a factor of 29–35-fold for both of these mutations, whereas the voltage dependence of agonist action was virtually the same for these mutations. Mutations of Ile1182 of the cardiac calcium channel either to Ala or Phe had only a minor impact on the agonist action of (+)-S-202–791.The holding potential had a more prevailing effect on the antagonist action of (−)-R-202–791 when the same mutants were tested. Characteristically lower IC50 values were observed for all mutants at −30-mV holding potential than at −80-mV holding potential. Similarly, more dramatic changes in IC50 values were noted for Y1178A and Y1489I than for mutants of Ile1182 as compared with the wild type channel. However, the substitution of I1182A and I1182F showed distinctly different behaviors upon antagonist application. The IC50of I1182A at −30-mV holding potential remained essentially the same as that of the wild type while there was an 8.6-fold increase in the IC50 when Ile1182 was substituted for phenylalanine. This change remains the same at a more negative holding potential (−80 mV) when compared with that of the wild type.The work of Grabner et al. (15Grabner M. Wang Z. Hering S. Striessnig J. Glossmann H. Neuron. 1996; 16: 207-218Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar) and Mitterdorfer et al. (19Mitterdorfer J. Wang Z. Sinnegger M.J. Hering S. Striessnig J. Grabner M. Glossmann H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30330-30335Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) showed that amino acids in IIIS5 are responsible for exerting differential effects toward DHP agonist and antagonist action. Specifically, the presence of Thr1006 (Thr1006according to the nomenclature of Mitterdorfer et al. (19Mitterdorfer J. Wang Z. Sinnegger M.J. Hering S. Striessnig J. Grabner M. Glossmann H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30330-30335Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar)) mediated a substantial portion of the DHP antagonist action when this amino acid was introduced into the α1A, non-DHP-sensitive calcium channel. However, this mutant construct showed no DHP agonist sensitivity. To render an α1a, non-DHP-sensitive calcium channel, sensitive to the agonist, the combined presence of Thr1006 and Glu1010 (Thr1066 and Glu1070 according to the numbering of Mitterdorfer et al. (19Mitterdorfer J. Wang Z. Sinnegger M.J. Hering S. Striessnig J. Grabner M. Glossmann H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30330-30335Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar)) was necessary (19Mitterdorfer J. Wang Z. Sinnegger M.J. Hering S. Striessnig J. Grabner M. Glossmann H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30330-30335Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Based on a number of previous observations (13Tang S. Yatani A. Bahinski A. Mori Y. Schwartz A. Neuron. 1993; 11: 1013-1021Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 15Grabner M. Wang Z. Hering S. Striessnig J. Glossmann H.

Chem. 1997; 272: 2629-2631Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) and on our present work, it is now clear that, even though sites might overlap, some amino acids (Thr1006 and Glu1010) preferentially contribute to the antagonist and agonist interaction sites, respectively. Further, distinct substitutions at other sites (Ile1182) may induce conformational changes that preferentially favor the agonist or the antagonist interaction.The observation that substitution of Ile1182 for phenylalanine decreased the sensitivity to antagonist without affecting the agonist sensitivity implies that a distinct site of action, and/or favorable conformation of the protein exists even though these site(s) may partly or completely overlap. This observation is, in principle, in accordance with a previous report from our laboratory (13Tang S. Yatani A. Bahinski A. Mori Y. Schwartz A. Neuron. 1993; 11: 1013-1021Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) and contradicts that of Peterson et al. (16Peterson B.Z. Tanabe T.N. Catterall W.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5293-5296Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar), who claimed that the agonist and antagonist binding sites totally overlap, and especially for Ile1182, no discriminative function was noted between the agonist and antagonist action. This latter work, however, utilized an experimental system that is significantly different from ours; it uses skeletal muscle α1S subunit mutants and the conclusions are based only on direct radioligand binding to membranes which of course are at 0-mV membrane potential.We have investigated the inactivation kinetics of some DHP interaction site mutants. Due to the potential influence of contaminating Cl− currents in oocytes we used the “maximal slope of decay” as the parameter of inactivation. The Ile1182mutants showed maximal slope of decay very close to that of the wild type. Surprisingly, the Y1178A and Y1489I exhibited significantly faster inactivation than the wild type. Similar findings were reported by Shuster et al. (17Schuster A. Lacinova L. Klugbauer N. Ito H. Birnbaumer L. Hofmann F. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2365-2370Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar); however, these authors attributed the increased current decay to the presence of the antagonist, and they raised the possibility that this phenomenon is a consequence of a second, lower affinity binding site. Mutations of the tyrosine in rat brain α1c (18Hockerman G.H. Johnson B.D. Scheuer T. Catterall W.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22119-22122Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar) that correspond to Tyr1489 of the rabbit heart channel caused changes of the apparent reversal potential of peak calcium channel current and also showed changes in permeation properties of the channel, suggesting that this amino acid faces the channel pore and is involved in the ion-conducting pathway. Here we have shown that the mutants we investigated exhibited differential properties to the action of the antagonist (−)-R-202–791 in terms of accelerating inactivation. In this regard, wild type, mutants of Ile1182 and Y1489I fell in the same category; i.e. the antagonist compound (−)-R-202–791 inhibited the current amplitude to various extents; however, the concentration dependence of the drug on the acceleration of inactivation appeared virtually identical. Contrary to this, the sensitivity of the inactivation of Y1178A in response to (−)-R-202–791 showed altered concentration dependence compared with the previous group of mutants. This suggests that in these mutants, although the effect of the DHP antagonist in blocking the peak current is lowered, its effect on acceleration inactivation kinetics remains unchanged. In other words, distinct sites of action of DHP antagonists might exist for blocking the peak current and for accelerating the inactivation of the channels.A closer examination of the concentration-response relationship of (+)-S-202–791 on the shift of peak potential showed that mutants of Ile1182 overlap with that of the wild type resulting in a negative shift of about 16–18 mV. On the other hand, the shift of peak potential for Y1178A and Y1489I differed about 10-fold, and the maximum shift for these mutants appeared around −10 mV. The interaction of DHP agonists with L-type calcium channels increase the probability of opening and the mean open time (35Brown A.M. Kunze D.L. Yatani A. J. Physiol. 1986; 379: 495-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). In terms of kinetics, these drugs shift the channel activation to hyperpolarizing potentials. The structural basis for this effect is largely unknown, however, a previous model, that assumed that the DHP binding site is in close proximity to the S4 segments (36Langs D.A. Strong P.D. Triggle D.J. J. Comp. Aided Mol. Des. 1990; 4: 215-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) is doubtful since recent findings have indicated that amino acids in IIIS5, IIIS6, and IVS6 transmembrane segments contribute to the DHP interaction site (16Peterson B.Z. Tanabe T.N. Catterall W.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5293-5296Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 17Schuster A. Lacinova L. Klugbauer N. Ito H. Birnbaumer L.

Chem. 1997; 272: 2629-2631Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Our results indicate that mutation of Tyr1178 and Tyr1489 largely impaired the communication between the S4 voltage sensor region and the DHP interaction site, resulting in a partial loss of the voltage shift by a DHP agonist. In contrast, mutations of Ile1182, assuming an α-helical structure for the IIIS6 segment, is just one turn away from Tyr1178 and has no influence on the communication between the S4 segment and the DHP interaction site.The structural rearrangement of voltage-gated calcium channels that “moves charges” in the electric field of the membrane in response to depolarization is a well documented phenomenon (37Neely A. Wei X. Olcese R. Birnbaumer L. Stefani E. Science. 1993; 262: 575-578Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar, 38Josephson I.R. Varadi G. Biophys.

Recent molecular evidence for theShaker potassium channel (42Mannuzzu L.M. Moronne M.M. Isacoff E.Y. Science. 1996; 271: 213-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar) showed that during channel activation a stretch of seven amino acids of the S4 region moved from a buried position into the extracellular environment. Considering the analogous structure and activation mechanism, there are a number of reasons that the behavior of all voltage-gated calcium channels is similar. Thus, it is likely that the movement of the outer segment of the S4 induces movements of the outer part of the IIIS6 and IVS6 segments.At the present time, 13 amino acid substitutions in IIIS5, IIIS6, and IVS6 have revealed regions involved in DHP interaction (16Peterson B.Z.

Interestingly, truncation immediately membrane proximal to Tyr582 (ΔDGS construct) did not alter internalization kinetics significantly (ΔDGSversus wild-type, mean surface half-life = 42versus 45 min, respectively). Thus, it appears that the tyrosine residues are not required for internalization of E-selectin. Additional analyses indicated that Ser581 was necessary but alone was insufficient for surface E-selectin endocytosis.

Lopes N. Immunology. 1993; 79: 600-607PubMed Google Scholar, 7Norris P. Poston R.N. Thomas D.S. Thornhill M. Hawk J. Haskard D.O. J. Invest.

The specific mechanisms involved in regulating E-selectin surface expression have not been elucidated fully. Human vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1) 1The abbreviations used are: VCAM-1, vascular cell adhesion molecule-1; AP, adaptor protein; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; WT, wild-type; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; mAb, monoclonal antibody; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; HUVEC, human umbilical vascular endothelial cells; PMN, polymorphonuclear leukocyte., another type I integral membrane protein expressed on activated endothelium, is shed from the cell surface (9Pigott R.

Immunol. 1994; 152: 5060-5069PubMed Google Scholar). This shedding process probably occurs as a result of metalloprotease cleavage of surface VCAM-1 at the juxtamembranous region of the extracellular domain (12Leca G. Mansur S.E. Bensussan A. J. Immunol. 1995; 154: 1069-1077PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, most of the surface-expressed E-selectin undergoes efficient endocytosis and is degraded rapidly in the lysosomal compartment (11Kuijpers T.W. Raleigh M. Kavanagh T. Janssen H. Calafat J. Roos D. Harlan J.M. J. Immunol. 1994; 152: 5060-5069PubMed Google Scholar, 13von Asmuth E.J. Smeets E.F. Ginsel L.A. Onderwater J.J. Leeuwenberg J.F. Buurman W.A. Eur. J.

It is shed only slowly and in minute quantities in vitro (9Pigott R. Dillon L.P. Hemingway I.H. Gearing A.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Immunology. 1992; 77: 543-549PubMed Google Scholar). E-selectin internalization can be partially inhibited by the nonspecific protein kinase inhibitor staurosporine but not by inhibitors of protein kinase C, cAMP-dependent protein kinase A, or protein tyrosine kinase (11Kuijpers T.W. Raleigh M. Kavanagh T. Janssen H. Calafat J. Roos D. Harlan J.M. J. Immunol. 1994; 152: 5060-5069PubMed Google Scholar). The signal motif, presumably located within the cytoplasmic domain, mediating E-selectin endocytosis has not been determined. Tyrosine-containing cytoplasmic motifs have been reported to mediate rapid endocytosis of a number of integral proteins. The NPXY motif in the low density lipoprotein receptor is a well defined example (17Chen W.-J. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 3116-3123Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A mutation of that tyrosine residue results in significant impairment of cellular low density lipoprotein cholesterol uptake and the phenotype of familial hypercholesterolemia in patients (18Davis C.G. Lehrman M.A. Russell D.W. Anderson R.G. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Cell. 1986; 45: 15-24Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). These tyrosine-containing motifs have been postulated to assume a tight reverse turn structural conformation (19Eberle W. Sander C. Klaus W. Schmidt B. von Figura K. Peters C. Cell. 1991; 67: 1203-1209Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 20Bansal A. Gierasch L.M.

Carpenter G. Science. 1993; 261: 612-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar, 24Sosa M.A. Schmidt B. von Figura K. Hille-Rehfeld A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12537-12543Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although one study questioned the requirement for the proposed reverse turn structural conformation of the tyrosine-containing motifs (25Wilde A. Dempsey C. Banting G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7131-7136Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the medium chain subunits (μ1, also known as AP47, and μ2, also known as AP50) of clathrin-associated adaptor protein complexes (AP1 and AP2) have been shown to interact with specific tyrosine-containing motifs using yeast two-hybrid systems (26Ohno H.

Fournier M.-C. Poy G. Bonifacino J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29009-29015Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of the critical tyrosine residue may not be a requisite event before internalization (27Ohno H. Fournier M.-C. Poy G. Bonifacino J.S. J. Biol.

Biol. 1994; 14: 4843-4854Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). There are also endocytosis motifs that do not involve tyrosine, such as the di-leucine (29Letourneur F. Klausner R.D. Cell. 1992; 69: 1143-1157Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar, 30Pond L. Kuhn L.A. Teyton L. Schutze M.P. Tainer J.A. Jackson M.R. Peterson P.A. J. Biol.

Chem. 1994; 269: 5210-5217Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and di-lysine (32Itin C. Kappeler F. Linstedt A.D. Hauri H.P. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2250-2256Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) sequences. Depending on the particular molecule, phosphorylation of specific cytoplasmic serine residues membrane-proximal to the di-leucine motifs may (33Dietrich J. Hou X. Wegener A.M. Geisler C. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2156-2166Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar, 34Shin J. Doyle C. Yang Z. Kappes D. Strominger J.L. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 425-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) or may not (31Ogata S. Fukuda M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5210-5217Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) be required for efficient endocytosis. Because the medium chains of either of the AP complexes failed to interact with a di-leucine motif studied (26Ohno H. Stewart J. Fournier M.C. Bosshart H. Rhee I. Miyatake S. Saito T. Gallusser A. Kirchhausen T. Bonifacino J.S. Science. 1995; 269: 1872-1875Crossref PubMed Scopus (830) Google Scholar), other subunits of the AP complexes or novel homologs might recognize and interact specifically with this motif. Alternatively, there are diverse molecular endocytic mechanisms by which a variety of signal motifs are recognized and processed (35Marks M.S. Woodruff L. Ohno H. Bonifacino J.S. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 341-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar, 36Lamaze C. Schmid S.L. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1995; 7: 573-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). The putative cytoplasmic domain of E-selectin is relatively short (32 amino acid residues). Although E-selectin is related to L- and P- selectin structurally and phylogenetically, they share little homology within this domain. This is in contrast to the relative cross-species conservation of the cytoplasmic domain of E-selectin (Fig.1 A). Accordingly, the fate of E-selectin after surface expression is quite divergent from that of L- and P-selectin. Unlike surface-expressed E-selectin, L-selectin is shed rapidly after leukocyte activation (37Spertini O. Freedman A.S. Belvin M.P. Penta A.C. Griffin J.D. Tedder T.F. Leukemia. 1991; 5: 300-308PubMed Google Scholar). P-selectin, once expressed on the endothelial cell surface, is internalized and subsequently recycled to the cell surface or degraded in lysosomes (15Subramaniam M. Koedam J.A. Wagner D.D. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1993; 4: 791-801Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 38Green S.A. Setiadi H. McEver R.P. Kelly R.B. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 435-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). The cytoplasmic domain of E-selectin contains two tyrosine residues (Tyr582 and Tyr587). One of these, the membrane-proximal residue at position 582 of the mature protein, in the context of its neighboring residues, was predicted to fit a generic structural motif for efficient endocytosis (39Ktistakis N.T. Thomas D. Roth M.G. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 1393-1407Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Additionally, the cytoplasmic domain of E-selectin contains a potential endocytosis motif similar to the di-leucine motif at its COOH terminus as well as that similar to the di-lysine motif, described above, in the juxtamembrane region. Surface-expressed E-selectin is phosphorylated at serine residues but not tyrosine residues (14Smeets E.F. de Vries T. Leeuwenberg J.F. van den Eijnden D.H. Buurman W.A. Neefjes J.J. Eur. J. Immunol. 1993; 23: 147-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). However, the phosphorylation event was reported to be unrelated to the endocytosis of E-selectin (14Smeets E.F. de Vries T. Leeuwenberg J.F. van den Eijnden D.H. Buurman W.A. Neefjes J.J. Eur. J. Immunol. 1993; 23: 147-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the cytoplasmic domain of human VCAM-1 has a single tyrosine residue that is conserved (Fig. 1 B), but, as mentioned above, surface-expressed VCAM-1 is not internalized rapidly. The aim of our study was to define further the endocytosis motif in E-selectin. We show here that neither Tyr582 nor Tyr587 is required for efficient endocytosis of surface E-selectin. Instead, Ser581 and residues membrane-proximal to it are required. Human E-selectin cDNA was a gift from M. Bevilacqua, Amgen, Thousand Oaks, CA (5Bevilacqua M.P. Stengelin S. Gimbrone M.A.J. Seed B. Science. 1989; 243: 1160-1165Crossref PubMed Scopus (1682) Google Scholar). The full-length coding region along with 360 base pairs of the 3′-untranslated region of the cDNA was subcloned into the mammalian cell expression vector pDX (kindly provided by K. Kaushansky, University of Washington, Seattle) (40Kane W.H. Devore-Carter D. Ortel T.L. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 6762-6768Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). To generate the various cytoplasmic mutant constructs (Fig. 2), we took advantage of the unique restriction sites, DraIII, located 120 base pairs 5′ to the transmembrane domain, andNotI, located at the 3′-end of the subcloned cDNA. For construction of the substitution mutants, sequential PCRs were carried out as described previously (41Ho S.N. Hunt H.D. Horton R.M. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene ( Amst. ). 1989; 77: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (6850) Google Scholar). In the first PCR, a sense primer corresponding to the DraIII site and an antisense internal mutagenic oligonucleotide were used as the primer pair. In the second PCR, the respective sense internal mutagenic oligonucleotide and the antisense primer corresponding to the NotI site were used as the primer pair. The wild-type (WT) E-selectin construct was used as the template in both of these reactions. In the final PCR, aliquots of melted gel slices containing PCR products from the above reactions were combined as the template; the sense DraIII and the antisenseNotI primers were used as the primer pair. The final PCR product was then isolated in and extracted from agarose gel, digested with DraIII and NotI restriction enzymes, and subcloned into the purified WT E-selectin expression vector previously digested with the same enzymes. Applying a similar strategy, we substituted the full-length cytoplasmic tail of human VCAM-1 for that of E-selectin using hybrid mutagenic oligonucleotides having one end complementary to E-selectin transmembrane domain and the other end to VCAM-1 cytoplasmic domain. Human VCAM-1 cDNA (kindly provided by L. Osborn, Biogen, Inc., Cambridge Center, MA) (42Osborn L. Hession C. Tizard R. Vassallo C. Luhowskyj S. Chi R.-G. Lobb R. Cell. 1989; 59: 1203-1211Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1429) Google Scholar) was used as the template in the second PCR reaction described above. For construction of the premature cytoplasmic termination mutants, the NotI site sequence was added immediately downstream from the premature stop codon in the design of the respective antisense mutagenic oligonucleotides. Each of these oligonucleotides, along with the senseDraIII primer as the primer pair and the WT construct as the template, were used to generate a PCR product that was subcloned subsequently into the expression vector as before. Each of the mutant clones generated was sequenced to verify the region spanning from theDraIII site to the NotI site. The deduced cytoplasmic tail amino acid sequences for the various mutants constructs are summarized in Fig. 2. Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells were plated onto three 12-well tissue culture plates (Costar, Cambridge, MA) and grown to 70–80% confluence. Each of the wells was inoculated with 500 μl of Opti-MEM (Life Technologies, Inc.) containing LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.) at 8 μg/ml and an expression vector construct at 2 μg/ml for 4 h. These were further incubated overnight with the addition of 500 μl/well of regular CHO medium consisting of α-minimal essential medium with 10% fetal calf serum and 2 mml-glutamine. They were then washed and replaced with regular CHO medium. The 125I-CD62E mAb internalization assays were performed 48 h after the initial transfection. The CD62E mAb, P6E2 (CY1878), was a generous gift from L. Phillips and J. Paulson, Cytel Corporation, San Diego. For each internalization assay, 90 μg of P6E2 was iodinated with 1 mCi of 125I using IODO-BEADS (Pierce Chemical Co.). The reaction was terminated at 12 min of incubation by removing the iodination mixture from the IODO-BEADS. Labeled P6E2 was separated from unincorporated 125I using a size-exclusion desalting column (Presto Column, Pierce). The final eluted volume was adjusted to 18 ml with PBS containing 1 mmMgCl2, 1 mm CaCl2, and 0.1% bovine serum albumin (PBS+). We modified the procedure reported previously by von Asmuthet al. (13von Asmuth E.J. Smeets E.F. Ginsel L.A. Onderwater J.J. Leeuwenberg J.F. Buurman W.A. Eur. J. Immunol. 1992; 22: 2519-2526Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar) to measure the surface kinetics of expressed E-selectin. For a typical experiment, one 12-well CHO cell plate/time point was assayed at 0, 30, and 60 min. Each plate/time point included four groups (in triplicate wells) of CHO cells that had been transiently transfected with the following constructs: WT E-selectin (positive control), ΔCyto with near total cytoplasmic domain truncation of E-selectin (Fig. 2), vector alone without cDNA insert (background control), and the test construct. Plates were prechilled on ice and washed twice with ice-cold PBS+. Five hundred μl of prechilled 125I-P6E2/well was added for a 15-min incubation on ice. Each well was then washed three times with 2 ml of cold PBS+ to remove unbound 125I-P6E2. After the last wash, 1 ml/well of regular CHO medium prewarmed to 37 °C was added (at time 0) to the 30- and 60-min plates to initiate active endocytosis, and the plates were placed in 37 °C incubator for the designated duration. At the same time, 1 ml/well of ice-cold regular CHO medium was added to the time 0 plate, which had been kept on ice. At the appropriate times, the supernatant medium in each well was collected and saved. Each well was then washed once with 1 ml and once with 2 ml of cold PBS+. The washes were saved. The saved supernatant medium and the washes from each respective well were combined and represented the supernatant fraction for that well. Subsequently, each well was incubated for 10 min with 1 ml of cold sodium citrate (0.1m, pH 3.0) to dissociate surface-bound125I-P6E2. Additional washes were completed with 1 ml/well sodium citrate followed by 2 ml/well cold PBS+. The acid-eluted and wash aliquots were combined and represented the surface fraction for that well. Finally, the cells in each well were lysed with 1 ml of 1n NaOH for 30 min at room temperature. Each well was scraped and the content collected. Additional washes with 1 ml/well NaOH followed by 2 ml/well PBS were carried out. The lysis and wash aliquots were combined and represented the internalized fraction for that well. The total radioactivity in each fraction was counted and recorded. Thus, each well represented an independent transfection reaction, yielding three data points (supernatant, surface, and internalized fractions) at a given time point. For each fraction at a time point, the radioactivity counts from the background control wells (CHO cells transiently transfected with vector alone without cDNA insert) were averaged. The radioactivity count from each of the other wells on the same plate was then adjusted by subtracting the mean background count. The mean background count of the surface fraction at any time point was typically <5% and frequently <1% of the surface fraction counts from the other wells. The adjusted count of each fraction from each well was then expressed as a percentage of the adjusted total count (supernatant, surface, and internalized fractions) of that well. The estimated surface half-lives of the various protein constructs were calculated from rate constants derived from curve fitting using the software KaleidaGraph (Synergy Software, Reading, PA), assuming first-order exponential decay characteristics. Analyses of variance were used to test differences of the surface fractions between relevant constructs at each time points. In contrast to VCAM-1, E-selectin is internalized efficiently in tumor necrosis factor-activated human umbilical vascular endothelial cells (HUVEC), suggesting that the cytoplasmic tail of E-selectin contains an internalization signal (11Kuijpers T.W. Raleigh M. Kavanagh T. Janssen H. Calafat J. Roos D. Harlan J.M. J. Immunol. 1994; 152: 5060-5069PubMed Google Scholar, 13von Asmuth E.J. Smeets E.F. Ginsel L.A. Onderwater J.J. Leeuwenberg J.F. Buurman W.A. Eur. J. Immunol. 1992; 22: 2519-2526Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). To investigate this possibility further, we first conducted pilot experiments utilizing 125I-labeled human E-selectin mAb P6E2 in the acid elution assay described above, in previously cloned CHO cells stably transfected with the WT human E-selectin cDNA. Consistent with previous studies in HUVEC (13von Asmuth E.J. Smeets E.F. Ginsel L.A. Onderwater J.J. Leeuwenberg J.F. Buurman W.A. Eur. J. Immunol. 1992; 22: 2519-2526Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar), our results indicated that the majority of the initially surface-bound 125I-P6E2 was internalized by 60 min (Fig. 3). Of note, recycling of surface E-selectin has not been reported, and, compared with that internalized, only a small fraction of surface-expressed E-selectin is shed in HUVEC (13von Asmuth E.J. Smeets E.F. Ginsel L.A. Onderwater J.J. Leeuwenberg J.F. Buurman W.A. Eur. J. Immunol. 1992; 22: 2519-2526Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 16Leeuwenberg J.F. Smeets E.F. Neefjes J.J. Shaffer M.A. Cinek T. Jeunhomme T.M. Ahern T.J. Buurman W.A. Immunology. 1992; 77: 543-549PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, over the time course studied, the amount of initially surface-bound 125I-P6E2 released into the supernatant medium at 4 °C was negligible (11Kuijpers T.W. Raleigh M. Kavanagh T. Janssen H. Calafat J. Roos D. Harlan J.M. J. Immunol. 1994; 152: 5060-5069PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, all subsequent experiments were performed on CHO cells transiently transfected with the various cytoplasmic domain constructs and focused on the kinetics of expressed surface E-selectin in the 1st h after labeling with the iodinated mAb. We first generated a near total cytoplasmic domain truncation construct, ΔCyto (Fig. 2). At 60 min, the surface fraction of the WT E-selectin decreased substantially to about one-third of the initial value (mean = 36.5%, S.D. = 5.1%, n = 69). With most of the putative cytoplasmic domain truncated except for one amino acid residue, the internalization of ΔCyto was significantly (p < 0.0001) impaired compared with WT (mean surface fraction at 60 min = 53.0%, S.D. = 4.1%, n = 42, Fig. 4 A). Consequently, the surface half-life of ΔCyto was nearly twice that of the WT (t 1/2-WT = 45 min versus t 1/2-ΔCyto = 79 min). The mean internalized fraction of the WT increased to 29.4% (S.D. = 4.3%) at 30 min and plateaued at 60 min (mean = 28.6%, S.D. = 4.1%), whereas that of the ΔCyto increased to a mean of 18.2% (S.D. = 2.6%) at 30 min and plateaued at 60 min (mean = 17.8%, S.D. = 2.0%) (Fig.4 B). Although reduced compared with WT, a significant fraction of initial ΔCyto was still internalized. Presumably, the internalization of ΔCyto occurred as a result of the normally constitutive membrane bulk flow in CHO cells. To define this observation further in CHO cells, the putative cytoplasmic domain of WT E-selectin was replaced with that of human VCAM-1 (ΔVCAM, Fig. 2). Because VCAM-1 internalization is reduced in cytokine-activated HUVEC compared with E-selectin (13von Asmuth E.J. Smeets E.F. Ginsel L.A. Onderwater J.J. Leeuwenberg J.F. Buurman W.A. Eur. J. Immunol. 1992; 22: 2519-2526Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar), we expected that ΔVCAM would have an internalization kinetics similar to that of ΔCyto. Indeed, this was the case (Fig. 4). Thus, although elements other than the cytoplasmic domain might also contribute to the endocytosis of E-selectin (43Setiadi H. Disdier M. Green S.A. Canfield W.M. McEver R.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26818-26826Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 44Verrey F. Gilbert T. Mellow T. Proulx G. Drickamer K. Cell Regul. 1990; 1: 471-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar), these results demonstrate that there is a determinant within the cytoplasmic domain which promotes endocytosis of surface-expressed E-selectin in CHO cells. The tyrosine-based endocytosis motif has been suggested to consist of 4–6 amino acid residues with the critical tyrosine residue located as the 3rd or 6th residue in the signal (45Naim H.Y. Roth M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3928-3933Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These include the proposed general motif of YXXØ (46Thomas D.C. Roth M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15732-15739Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), where Ø represents an amino acid residue with a bulky aliphatic or hydrophobic side chain and the well characterized motif NPXY (17Chen W.-J. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 3116-3123Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and others (45Naim H.Y. Roth M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3928-3933Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Inspecting the E-selectin cytoplasmic domain reveals several potential tyrosine-based endocytosis motifs: DGSY, YQKP, KPSY, and YQKPSY. Interestingly, the cytoplasmic domain of human VCAM-1 also contains two potential endocytosis motifs, KGSY and YSLV (Fig. 1 B) but failed to promote E-selectin endocytosis (ΔVCAM, Fig. 4). Clearly, the mere presence of tyrosine motif-like sequences in the cytoplasmic domain does not necessarily translate to predicted biologic function. To investigate the role of the cytoplasmic region containing the two tyrosine residues in promoting E-selectin endocytosis and to test the previous proposal that Tyr582 was a critical residue that conferred the function of efficient E-selectin internalization (39Ktistakis N.T. Thomas D. Roth M.G. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 1393-1407Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar), we designed several mutant constructs including ΔDGS, in which the cytoplasmic domain was truncated immediately proximal to Tyr582, and ΔLES, in which additional three COOH-terminal residues (DGS) were deleted (Fig.2). Fig. 5 shows that truncation of both Tyr582 and Tyr587 (ΔDGS) did not significantly alter the internalization of E-selectin. However, deletion of only three additional COOH-terminal residues (DGS) markedly reduced internalization. These results corroborated those obtained using ΔDGSA in which Tyr587 was truncated and Tyr582 was mutated to alanine (Fig. 2). Again, internalization kinetics were similar to WT (TableI).

Although substantial information is now available on substrate interactions and ATPase activity, neither the crystal structure of the intact Hsc70 molecule nor its isolated peptide-binding domain is known. Recently, the crystal structure of the isolated peptide-binding domain of an evolutionary relative of mammalian Hsc70, the DnaK protein of Escherichia coli, was solved. We have generated several rat Hsc70 mutants using site-directed and cassette mutagenesis guided by secondary structure predictions to test the hypothesis that the peptide-binding domains of mammalian Hsc70 and DnaK have similar molecular structures. Biochemical properties along with the ATPase and peptide binding activities of the resulting recombinant proteins were determined. Biochemical analyses included one- and two-dimensional gel electrophoresis, electrospray mass spectrometry, and N-terminal amino acid sequencing. The results of our study suggest that the DnaK molecular structure is a useful working model for the mammalian Hsc70 peptide-binding domain. Evidence is provided that (i) small additions to the N terminus of Hsc70 alter the function of the peptide-binding domain, (ii) alterations in the C-terminal tetrapeptide EEVD result in dramatic increases in basal ATPase activity, (iii) polyalanine substitution of a helical connector segment compensates for changes at the C terminus to restore near-normal function, (iv) specific side chain interactions involving this connector segment are not required for peptide-stimulated ATPase activity, and (v) disruption of the cap homologue region inhibits peptide binding by Hsc70.

The molecular chaperone Hsc70 of mammalian cells is an abundant, cytoplasmic protein that binds to nascent polypeptides, accompanies proteins to sites of membrane translocation and assembly, and may also deliver proteins targeted for degradation to lysosomes and proteasomes (1Hartl F.U. Nature. 1996; 381: 571-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (3115) Google Scholar, 2Rassow J. von Ahsen O. Bomer U. Pfanner N. Trends Cell Biol. 1997; 7: 129-133Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). All of these functions depend upon the ability of Hsc70 to preferentially bind unfolded proteins. Hsc70 selects peptides enriched in large neutral and aromatic amino acid residues from peptide phage display libraries, and these peptides are thought to represent the hydrophobic binding sites on unfolded proteins recognized by Hsc70 (3Fourie A.M. Sambrook J.F. Gething M.-J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30470-30478Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A second peptide motif containing hydrophobic and basic residues is also selected from these libraries by Hsc70 and may represent a different kind of chaperoning function (4Takenaka I.M. Leung S.-M. McAndrew S.J. Brown J.P. Hightower L.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19839-19844Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). X-ray diffraction studies have revealed an ATPase domain (residues 1–386, 44-kDa fragment) consisting of four subdomains arranged in a bilobed structure with a single ATP/ADP binding site located in a deep cleft between these lobes. The N terminus and the C terminus of the ATPase domain are located close together on one face of this domain, which may interact with the peptide-binding domain (5Flaherty K.M. DeLuca-Flaherty C. McKay D.B. Nature. 1990; 346: 623-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (829) Google Scholar). However, since the intact protein has not been crystallized, the relationship between the two domains is undefined. That the two domains interact has been clear from the earliest studies showing that clathrin (6Chappell T.G. Welch W.J. Schlossman D.M. Palter K.B. Schlesinger M.J. Rothman J.E. Cell. 1986; 45: 3-13Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar, 7Ungewickell E. EMBO J. 1985; 4: 3385-3391Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar) and bound peptide/unfolded proteins stimulate Hsc70 ATPase activity (8Sadis S. Hightower L.E. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 9406-9412Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 9Palleros D. Welch W. Fink A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 5719-5723Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). The isolated 44-kDa fragment has elevated, unregulated ATPase activity (10Chappell T.G. Konforti B.B. Schmid S.L. Rothman J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 746-751Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that the peptide-binding domain acts as a brake. The conformations as well as the activities of the two domains are coupled (11Fung K.L. Hilgenberg L. Wang N.M. Chirico W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21559-21565Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Additional evidence of overall changes in conformation as well as the overall shape of the molecule came from solution small-angle x-ray scattering studies of recombinant bovine Hsc70 and derived fragments (12Wilbanks S.M. Chen L.L. Tsuruta H. Hodgson K.O. Mckay D.B. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 12095-12106Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). These data suggest that the peptide-binding domain is relatively flat and may interact either end-to-end or side-by-side with the ATP-bound form of the ATPase domain. In the model for the ADP-bound form of Hsc70, the molecule is longer with less interaction between the two domains. Much of this analysis was carried out using an N-terminal 60-kDa fragment. In another study, a comparison of tryptophan fluorescence emission spectra of recombinant human Hsp70 and a deletion mutant missing the C-terminal EEVD indicated a change in conformation of the mutant protein. Increases in both Stokes radius and frictional ratio accompanied this change (13Freeman B.C. Myers M.P. Schumacher R. Morimoto R.I. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2281-2292Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar), suggesting that the interaction of EEVD with the ATPase domain may limit the full expansion of the 60-kDa fragment modeled in the x-ray scattering studies. A glutathione S-transferase fusion protein containing the 18-kDa segment (residues 384–543) following the N-terminal ATPase domain had affinities for several peptides similar to intact Hsc70 (14Wang T.-F. Chang J. Wang C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26049-26051Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, the peptide binding domain of Hsc70 resides in this segment, which consists of two four-stranded anti-parallel β-sheets and a single α-helix, as determined with multidimensional NMR (15Morshauser R.C. Wang H. Flynn G.C. Zuiderweg E.R.P. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 6261-6266Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). These data rule out a model for the peptide-binding domain of Hsp70 family proteins based on the peptide-binding region of the major histocompatibility complex class I molecules which predicted two α-helices and seven β-strands connected in a different order (16Flajnik M. Canel C. Kramer J. Kasahara M. Immunogenetics. 1991; 33: 295-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar,17Rippmann F. Taylor W. Rothbard J. Green N. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 1053-1059Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). The secondary structure elements identified by NMR in Hsc70 have also been identified in the crystal structure at 2.0-Å resolution of the peptide-binding fragment (residues 389–607) of DnaK bound to a heptameric peptide (18Zhu X.T. Zhao X. Burkholder W.F. Gragerov A. Ogata C.M. Gottesman M.E. Hendrickson W.A. Science. 1996; 272: 1606-1614Crossref PubMed Scopus (1058) Google Scholar). The overall structure is about 60 by 40 by 15 Å which agrees well with the shape of the Hsc70 peptide-binding fragment deduced from small-angle scattering measurements (12Wilbanks S.M. Chen L.L. Tsuruta H. Hodgson K.O. Mckay D.B. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 12095-12106Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). The peptide-binding domain consists of two four-stranded β-sheets arranged like the palms of clasped hands with two of the connecting loops holding the peptide and two loops supporting the two binding loops. The core binding site is hydrophobic as expected with some negatively charged surface at each end, which explains why basic residues are allowed and negative residues excluded at the ends of the peptide substrates favored by DnaK. A long, bent helix connects the molecular hands to a cap structure composed of the C-terminal part of the long helix joined by three short helices. A second crystal structure was determined in which the cap structure is tilted up by a kink in the long helix at about position 537, suggesting that movement of the cap is part of the conformational changes that occur in the molecule. The CD spectra of DnaK and bovine Hsc70 are almost superimposable, indicating substantial overall structural similarity (19Sadis S. Raghavendra K. Schuster T.M. Hightower L.E. Villafranca J.J. Current Research in Protein Chemistry. Academic Press, New York1990: 339-347Crossref Google Scholar). Encouraged by this comparison, we tested several predictions of the DnaK crystal structure using mutated forms of Hsc70. The placement of restriction sites to create these mutants was guided by secondary structure predictions (20Sadis S. Raghavendra K. Hightower L.E. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 8199-8206Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) that were subsequently verified in part by NMR studies (15Morshauser R.C. Wang H. Flynn G.C. Zuiderweg E.R.P. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 6261-6266Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). [3H]NaBH4 (28 Ci/mmol) was from Amersham Corp. [γ-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol) was from NEN Life Science Products. All restriction endonucleases and modifying enzymes were from Boehringer Mannheim. The rat hsc70 gene was cloned into the NcoI and HindIII sites of the expression vector pKK233-2 (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) and was designated pKS1 (see Table I for all plasmid/protein designations). The rathsc70 sequence originated from a full-length cDNA in the plasmid pRC62 (21O'Malley K. Mauron A. Barchas J.D. Kedes L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1985; 5: 3476-3483Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar) which was obtained from Dr. Larry Kedes (Stanford University, CA).Table IPlasmid/protein designations and descriptionsPlasmidProteinDescriptionHsc70bcBovine brain Hsc70pRC62Hsc70Wild-type (wt)pKS1Hsc70Wild-typepKS1+Hsc70+wt, restriction sites + (rs+)pKS1αh1-AlaHsc70αh1-Alars+, poly(Ala) substitution of α-helix 1512–536pKS1Δαh3Hsc70Δαh3rs+, deletion of α-helix 3572–599pQE30+Hsc70/N-Hiswt, rs+, N-terminal His6 tagpQE30αh1-AlaHsc70αh1-Ala/N-Hisrs+, α-helix 1 = poly(A), N-terminal His6 tagpQE60+Hsc70/C-Hiswt, rs+, C-terminal His6 tagpQE60αh1-AlaHsc70αh1-Ala/C-Hisrs+, α-helix 1 = poly(A), C-terminal His6 tag Open table in a new tab The secondary structure of rat Hsc70 has been predicted using circular dichroism spectroscopy analyzed with deconvolution methods and both the Chou-Fasman and Garnier-Osguthorpe-Robson algorithms (20Sadis S. Raghavendra K. Hightower L.E. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 8199-8206Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Six unique restriction sites that flank regions coding for three predicted α-helices in the peptide-binding domain were incorporated by site-directed mutagenesis (pKS1+). Five of the six changes resulted in silent mutations, and one resulted in a serine to threonine change (Fig. 1, at position 537). N-terminal histidine6-Hsc70 fusion proteins were constructed by subcloning the blunt-ended NcoI/HindIII fragment of pKS1+ into the blunt-ended BamHI site of pQE30 (Qiagen) resulting in the addition of the following amino acids to the N terminus: Met-Arg-Gly-Ser-His6-Gly-Ser. C-terminal histidine6-Hsc70 fusion proteins were generated by subcloning a polymerase chain reaction-generated hsc70 sequence without the stop codon into the NcoI and blunt-endedBglII sites of pQE60. The resulting proteins contained eight additional amino acids: Arg-Ser-His6. The substitution of amino acids 512–533 of Hsc70 with alanine residues (pKS1αh1-Ala, pQE30αh1-Ala, and pQE60αh1-Ala) was carried out by cassette mutagenesis using the unique AflII andBstEII sites created by site-directed mutagenesis (Fig. 1). The polyalanine cassette was constructed using synthetic oligonucleotides corresponding to both DNA strands, and each strand of the cassette was synthesized as two oligonucleotides. The final double-stranded DNA cassette consisting of four oligonucleotides with the following sequences: 1, TTAAGTGCGGCCGCTGCTGCTGCTCTGCTGCTGCTGCTG; 2, CACGACGACGACGACGACGCCGGCGACGACGACGACGACG; 3, GCTGCTGCTGCTGCTGCTGCCGCTGCTGCTGCTGCTAAG; and 4, ACGACGACGACGACGGCGACGACGACGACGATTCCAATG. A construct with amino acids 572–599 deleted (pKS1Δαh3) was generated by digesting pKS1+ with XbaI and XhoI, two of the unique sites incorporated by mutagenesis. This segment was removed, and the DNA was ligated after filling the 5′ ends with Klenow. This blunt ending resulted in the addition of a valine residue. Site-directed and cassette mutagenesis were carried out essentially as described by others (22Kendall D.A. Kaiser E.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 7261-7265Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23Kunkel T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 488-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (4897) Google Scholar). LB supplemented with either ampicillin (100 mg/liter) or kanamycin (25 mg/liter) was used to propagate the plasmid DNA in the host Escherichia coli strain SG12036 (Δgal,Δlon-510, sulA). The cells were incubated at 30 °C on a shaker, and protein expression was induced by the addition of 4 mmisopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside when theA 600 reached approximately 0.8 absorbance units. The incubation was continued for an additional 3 h after which the cells were collected by centrifugation and washed with ice-cold buffer I (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 10 mm EDTA, 50 mm dextrose). After re-centrifugation the pellet was resuspended in buffer I supplemented with the following protease inhibitors: 4-(2-aminoethyl)-benzenesulfonylfluoride, phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, leupeptin, pepstatin, and bestatin. All protease inhibitors were obtained from Boehringer Mannheim except 4-(2-aminoethyl)-benzenesulfonylfluoride which was obtained from Calbiochem. Unless otherwise specified, all subsequent steps were carried out at 4 °C. Cells were lysed by sonication after treatment with lysozyme. The supernatant was recovered and dialyzed overnight against buffer C (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.0, 10 mmammonium sulfate, 25 mm KCl, 2 mm magnesium acetate, 0.1 mm EDTA, and 0.1 mmdithiothreitol) without magnesium acetate. This dialysis step was included to facilitate the removal of Mg2+/ATP that may be bound to Hsc70, thereby allowing maximum binding to ATP-agarose. Nonfusion proteins were purified by sequential chromatography using ATP attached through C-8 to agarose (Sigma), Q-Sepharose anion exchange resin (Pharmacia), and gel filtration with a Bio-Sil high performance liquid chromatography column (Bio-Rad). Only the peak fractions from the Q-Sepharose column that were negative for DnaK by Western blot analysis were pooled and concentrated for gel filtration chromatography. For immunoblotting, rabbit polyclonal antibody raised against DnaK was obtained from Dr. Roger McMacken (Johns Hopkins University). Nickel resin (Qiagen) was used in place of ATP-agarose for the proteins containing a His6 tag. The concentrations of the purified proteins were determined by absorbance at 280 nm using molar extinction coefficients (24Edelhoch H. Biochemistry. 1967; 6: 1948-1954Crossref PubMed Scopus (3002) Google Scholar) of 30,580m−1 cm−1 (Hsc70bc, Hsc70+, N- and C-terminal fusions), 29,300 m−1cm−1 (Hsc70αh1-Ala/N- and C-terminal His), and 24,890m−1 cm−1 (Hsc70Δαh3). The molar extinction for native bovine Hsc70 (Hsc70bc) was determined by others (25Greene L.E. Eisenberg E. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 6682-6687Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and the values for the mutants were obtained by correcting for changes in amino acid composition. ATPase assays were carried out as described previously (8Sadis S. Hightower L.E. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 9406-9412Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Briefly, 50-μl reactions were assembled containing 2.5 μg of Hsc70, a final concentration of 50 μm ATP, 20 μg of apocytochrome c(apoc), 1The abbreviation used is: apoc, apocytochrome c. 2 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP, and 1 × buffer C. The basal rate of ATP hydrolysis catalyzed by Hsc70 was measured in the absence of apoc. Aliquots were removed at 5-min intervals from 0 to 20 min and added to acidified, activated charcoal (50 mm HCl, 5 mm H3PO4, and 7% (w/v) activated charcoal). Acidified, activated charcoal effectively quenches the reactions and inhibits the enzyme activity after the sample is removed. During a subsequent 1-h incubation at room temperature, no significant hydrolysis of the [γ-32P]ATP occurred. The peptide binding assays, carried out essentially as described by others (26Flynn G.C. Chappell T.G. Rothman J.E. Science. 1989; 245: 385-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (579) Google Scholar), used increasing concentrations of a tritiated fragment of pigeon cytochromec (amino acids 81–104, described below). 50-μl reactions contained 1 × binding buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm EDTA), 2 μg of purified Hsc70, and [3H]cytochrome c peptide ranging from 300 to 1.56 μm with 2-fold serial dilutions. The reactions were incubated in a 37 °C water bath for 30 min after which free peptide was removed with Sephadex G-50 quick spin columns (Pharmacia). These columns were pre-equilibrated with binding buffer and blocked with 100 μl of a solution of bovine serum albumin (1 mg/ml). The cytochrome c peptide was labeled by reductive methylation with tritiated sodium borohydride, chemistry specific for the α-amino groups of peptides, and ε-amino groups of lysyl residues. The amino acid sequence of this peptide is as follows: IFAGIKKKAERADLIAYLKQATAK. Methylation was carried out essentially as described by others (27Tack B.F. Dean J. Eilat D. Lorenz P.E. Schechter A.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 8842-8847Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The final sample was purified with Sephadex G-10 (Pharmacia). Fractions that showed a peak of radioactivity coincident with a maximum absorbance at 214 nm were pooled. Several different rat Hsc70 mutants were created using site-directed and cassette mutagenesis (Table I). All proteins were purified to homogeneity as described in detail under “Experimental Procedures.” Nonfusion proteins were purified in successive steps of ATP-agarose, Q-Sepharose, and size exclusion chromatography (Fig. 2 A). To assess the biological activities of the various proteins, ATPase and peptide binding assays were carried out as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Wild-type Hsc70 encoded by DNA containing new restriction sites (Hsc70+) expressed in E. coli had elevated intrinsic ATPase activity compared with native Hsc70bc, with rates of 10.0 and 0.96 pmol/min/μg, respectively (TableII). This elevated intrinsic activity was similar to that observed for recombinant Hsc70bc encoded by DNA without the new restriction sites (data not shown), so the single amino acid change introduced by a new restriction site was not responsible for this elevated activity. Since recombinant Hsc70bc and Hsc70+ were similar with regard to ATPase activity and peptide binding, we used Hsc70+ to understand the differences between E. coliexpressed protein and native Hsc70bc. The basal ATPase activity for Hsc70+ was virtually unaffected by the addition of apoc, an unfolded protein substrate that stimulated the activity of Hsc70bc about 3-fold, as reported previously (8Sadis S. Hightower L.E. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 9406-9412Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar).Table IIATPase and peptide binding activitiesSpecific ATPase activity,2-apmol/min/μg.apoCScatchard analysis Kd−+μmHsc70bc0.90 ± 0.143.11 ± 0.2717.5n = 20n = 20Hsc70+10.0 ± 0.4011.4 ± 0.4522.2n = 8n = 8Hsc70/N-His13.2 ± 0.6012.1 ± 0.36Nonlinearn = 6n = 6Hsc70/C-His4.8 ± 0.596.8 ± 0.5162.9n = 5n = 5Hsc70αh1-7.0 ± 0.539.6 ± 0.76Nonlinear Ala/N-Hisn = 5n = 5Hsc70αh1-1.95 ± 0.214.4 ± 0.3127.0 Ala/C-Hisn = 6n = 6Hsc70Δαh-39.0 ± 0.459.3 ± 0.37No detectable bindingn = 5n = 5Specific ATPase activities are reported in the presence and absence of substrate (apoC).

Open table in a new tab Specific ATPase activities are reported in the presence and absence of substrate (apoC). Peptide binding affinities using a fragment of cytochrome c were determined by Scatchard analysis. Curves of 3H-pigeon cytochrome c fragment binding to Hsc70+ and two mutants were plotted and analyzed using GraphPad Prism 2.0 (Fig. 3 A). Both Hsc70+ and Hsc70bc had very similar curves that fit a one-site binding model with a K d of 16.9 μm, as calculated for Hsc70bc. The dissociation constant (K d) determined by Scatchard analysis for Hsc70+ was 22.2 μm, essentially the same as for Hsc70bc at 17.5 μm (Table II and Fig. 3 B). Thus, the ATPase and peptide-binding domains of Hsc70+ were active but uncoupled, with no stimulation of ATPase by bound peptide and an elevated, unregulated ATPase activity similar to the 44-kDa fragment described under the Introduction. To develop a general purification scheme for mutant proteins, regardless of their affinity for ATP-agarose, the various constructs were cloned into vectors encoding a six-residue histidine tag (His6) for nickel chelation chromatography. His-tagged fusion proteins were isolated using a nickel-agarose affinity step followed by Q-Sepharose and size exclusion chromatography (Fig. 2 B). The His6 tag, when placed at the N terminus of Hsc70, had little effect on ATPase activity, which remained insensitive to the addition of apoc (Table II). However, the placement of a His6 tag at the N terminus had a drastic effect on peptide binding. The binding curve (Fig. 3 A) could not be fit to a one-site model and was best fit by a two-phase exponential function. However, the first five points could be fitted to a one-site model with a calculated K d of 52 μm, whereas the fit to all seven points (not shown) yielded a calculatedK d of 920 μm and no indication of saturable binding, suggesting a nonspecific interaction. Scatchard analysis of the binding assays yielded a nonlinear plot for Hsc70/N-His consistent with the presence of either two or more binding sites or multiple forms of Hsc70/N-His with at least 10-fold differences in affinity (Fig. 3 C). An explanation for the complex binding curve is proposed under “Discussion.” Due to the altered peptide binding caused by the His6 tag at the N terminus, a recombinant protein was engineered with the His6 tag at the C terminus. The binding data for this protein, Hsc70/C-His, could be fit to a one binding site model with a calculated K d of 32 μm (Fig.3 A), and it had a linear Scatchard plot with aK d of 62.9 μm (Fig. 3 D), indicating that the C-terminal modification was less disruptive to the peptide-binding domain than the N-terminal modification. Basal ATPase activity was lower than that of Hsc70+, and peptide-binding caused a small stimulation in ATP hydrolysis, suggesting that the two domains were weakly coupled in Hsc70/C-His. The biological activities of native Hsc70bc and E. coli-expressed Hsc70+ were clearly different. Therefore, we considered the possibility of differences in posttranslational modification of these proteins. To address this question, Hsc70 from rat embryo cell lysates was compared with rat Hsc70+ using two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (Fig.4). The pI of Hsc70+ was more basic than that of Hsc70 isolated from rat embryo cells. To investigate further this change in pI and to further characterize the fusion proteins, mass spectrometry and N-terminal sequencing were used (Table III). The molecular mass determinations from electrospray mass spectrometry for Hsc70bc and the C-terminal His6-tagged proteins agreed with the molecular weights calculated from amino acid compositions. However, the masses of the Hsc70+ and N-terminal His6-tagged proteins were smaller than expected. The results from protein sequencing indicated that the N termini of these proteins were intact, suggesting that amino acids were missing from the C terminus. This conclusion is consistent with the two-dimensional gel analysis of Hsc70+. The C terminus of native Hsc70 is an acidic EEVD tetrapeptide. Taken together with the mass spectrometry, these data were consistent with the loss of the last three amino acids, including two acidic residues, from Hsc70+ resulting in a more basic pI. The mass spectrometry data further indicated that the addition of a His6 tag to the C terminus of Hsc70+ protected the EEVD tetrapeptide.Table IIIMass spectrometry and N-terminal sequencing dataProteinMass3-aMolecular mass based on expected amino acid sequence.Mass spectrometry3-bElectrospray mass spectrometry.N terminus3-cN-terminal amino acids as determined by N-terminal amino acid sequencing; ND, not done.ConclusionDaHsc70bc71,24171,235NDAs expectedHsc70+70,83270,482IntactC-terminal processingHsc70/N-His72,25471,884IntactC-terminal processingHsc70/C-His71,92171,794Missing N-terminal MetAs expected without NMetHsc70αh1-Ala/C-His70,62270,669NDAs expectedElectrospray mass spectrometry results are compared with the expected mass for each protein.

Protein sequencing was carried out in those cases where the predicted mass and the mass spectrometry results did not agree. The purified proteins were also analyzed using nondenaturing polyacrylamide gels (Fig. 5). Purified Hsc70bc was separated into two major bands, previously identified as monomer and dimer (lanes 2 and 9). Hsc70+ had essentially the same pattern (lane 3) as did Hsc70/C-His (lane 4) except that both monomer and dimer of the latter protein migrated more slowly. Hsc70/N-His monomer migrated like Hsc70bc monomer; however, there was no band with the same mobility as Hsc70bc dimer and a slower migrating band was detected instead (lane 7). Thus, the N-terminal His6-tagged protein was altered in oligomer formation as well as peptide binding. The peptide-binding domain of DnaK is comprised of two subdomains. The first of these is formed by two sets of four anti-parallel β-strands. Each set forms a sheet and together they form a β-sandwich. The second subdomain contains five α-helices, two of which together serve as a connector and three form a cap that covers the substrate bound in a channel created mainly by two loops of the β-sandwich. The first construct that was generated contained a polyalanine substitution for amino acids 512–533 (residues 509–530 of helices αA-αB in DnaK), a segment corresponding to the two α-helices which serve as a connector between the cap and β-sandwich of DnaK. This segment, marked α-helix 1 in Fig. 1, was predicted using a secondary structure algorithm (20Sadis S. Raghavendra K. Hightower L.E. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 8199-8206Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) and later confirmed by NMR analysis (15Morshauser R.C. Wang H. Flynn G.C. Zuiderweg E.R.P. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 6261-6266Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). A polyalanine segment was chosen as a replacement because alanine residues occur frequently in α-helices and they are good helix formers (28Zhang M.L. Baase W.A. Matthews B.W.

https://openalex.org/W2049256583,"Abstract CHRC, a corolla-specific carotenoid-associated protein, is a major component of carotenoid-lipoprotein complexes inCucumis sativus chromoplasts. Using an in vitroflower bud culture system that mimics in vivo flower development, CHRC mRNA levels in corollas were shown to be specifically up-regulated by gibberellic acid. The response to gibberellic acid was very rapid (within 20 min) and insensitive to protein synthesis inhibition by cycloheximide. Abscisic acid, known to antagonize gibberellin in many developmental systems, strongly down-regulated CHRC mRNA levels. The gibberellin synthesis inhibitor paclobutrazol exhibited a similar negative effect on CHRC expression. Inclusion of exogenous gibberellic acid into the in vitro bud culture system with the paclobutrazol not only prevented the CHRC mRNA down-regulation, it up-regulated transcript accumulation to the level of gibberellic acid-treated corollas. CHRC mRNA accumulation in response to gibberellic acid displayed a dose-dependent increase up to 10−4 m gibberellic acid. The up-regulation could be detected with as little as 10−7 m gibberellic acid. Based on these data, we suggest thatCHRC is the first structural gene identified to date whose expression is regulated by gibberellic acid in a primary fashion. The critical role of the rapid response of CHRC to gibberellic acid in aiding carotenoid sequestration while preserving chromoplast structural organization is discussed."

Cytochrome c"" from the obligate methylotrophMethylophilus methylotrophus is a soluble monoheme protein of ∼15 kDa, which displays a redox-linked spin state transition from a low spin state in the oxidized form to a high spin state in the reduced form (1Costa H.S. Santos H. Turner D.L. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 215: 817-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The two axial ligands are histidines in the oxidized form, one of which is detached from heme upon reduction of the iron atom (2Santos H. Turner D.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1988; 954: 276-286Crossref Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Cytochrome c"" is a unique example of a heme-c protein with bis-histidine coordination and spectroscopic features similar to those observed in model compounds where axial ligand planes are forced into a perpendicular orientation by steric constraints (3Safo M.K. Gupta G.P. Walker F.A. Scheidt W.R. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1991; 113: 5497-5510Crossref Scopus (17) Google Scholar). NMR studies of the heme pocket have shown that it is quite stable at neutral pH, with low amide proton exchange rates and one of the heme propionates largely exposed at the surface, whereas the other one is buried in the protein (1Costa H.S. Santos H. Turner D.L. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 215: 817-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Attempts to crystallize the protein have been unsuccessful to date. The N-terminal half of the amino acid sequence has been determined, and it displays no significant similarity with sequences from any other protein (4Costa H.S. Santos H. Turner D.L. Xavier A.V. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 208: 427-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The midpoint redox potential of cytochrome c"" has a strong pH dependence (i.e. a redox Bohr effect) over the range between pH 4.0 and 10.0 (4Costa H.S. Santos H. Turner D.L. Xavier A.V. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 208: 427-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). NMR spectroscopy shows that some of the methyl resonances in the oxidized form display a shift as large as 3 ppm over the same range. The pH dependence of the midpoint redox potential has been analyzed in terms of a model that considers two ionizing groups with pK a values that change with the redox state of the protein (1Costa H.S. Santos H. Turner D.L. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 215: 817-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 4Costa H.S. Santos H. Turner D.L. Xavier A.V. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 208: 427-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). It was concluded that the group mainly responsible for the redox Bohr effect exhibited by cytochromec"" is one of the axial histidines that becomes detached in the reduced state with a pK a ≅ 8.1 for the ε2-NH in the reduced form and a pK a < 2 in the oxidized form (1Costa H.S. Santos H. Turner D.L. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 215: 817-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 4Costa H.S. Santos H. Turner D.L. Xavier A.V. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 208: 427-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). However, this very low pK a could not be determined accurately, because its value was far outside the range investigated by NMR and redox potentiometry. Cytochrome c"" shows a surprising resistance to acid, allowing us to extend the kinetic and spectroscopic investigation of its redox behavior to a more acid pH range and to characterize a reversible conformational transition in the oxidized form, which accounts for the whole proton-linked redox behavior. It is therefore an excellent model system of a proton/electron coupling device working over a very large pH range. Cytochrome c"" from M. methylotrophus was purified as previously reported (4Costa H.S. Santos H. Turner D.L. Xavier A.V. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 208: 427-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), dialyzed versusH2O, and kept frozen in small aliquots until employed for the experiment. Kinetics of reduction was measured in a Gibson-Durrum stopped flow apparatus equipped with a 2-cm path length observation cell and interfaced to a desk-top computer for fast data acquisition (On Line Instrument Service, Jefferson, GA). The system was carefully degassed, and oxidized cytochrome c"" (in a degassed buffer at the desired pH value) was mixed with a solution of sodium dithionite (at pH 7.0 in a very low ionic strength, i.e. I = 2 mm). In this way, exploiting the stability of cytochromec"" from M. methylotrophus at every pH investigated, we were able to keep the sodium dithionite solution in a stable situation, exposing it to acid pH values only for a few milliseconds. It must be remembered that the observed rate constant for reduction by sodium dithionite cannot necessarily be described only by the second order reduction rate constant k, because the overall rate iskobs=k·([SO42−]/K)Equation 1 where k is the intrinsic reduction rate constant andK = 7.1 × 108m−1 (5Lambeth D.O. Palmer G. J. Biol. Chem. 1973; 248: 6095-6103Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) is the equilibrium constant for the association of sodium dithionite 2SO2−⇋ S2O42−, because SO2− is the actual reducing agent (see below and Ref. 5Lambeth D.O. Palmer G. J. Biol. Chem. 1973; 248: 6095-6103Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, according to Equation 1 a variation of k obs may be attributed to several different sources, such as (i) a variation of k, (ii) a modification of the sodium dithionite dissociation constant K, or (iii) an alteration of sodium dithionite concentration as a consequence of the multiple equilibria present (6Mayhew S.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1978; 85: 535-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar). Different buffers (all at 0.3m) were employed according to the pH range, namely potassium phosphate/HCl between pH 1.5 and 3.5, sodium acetate between pH 3.5 and 5.5, potassium phosphate, MES 1The abbreviation used is: MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid. and HEPES between pH 5.5 and 7.5, Tris/HCl between pH 7.5 and 9.0, and sodium bicarbonate between pH 9.0 and pH 10.0. No buffer-dependent variation for the kinetic behavior was observed at overlapping pH values. The resonance Raman spectra were obtained by excitation with the 413.1-nm line of a Kr+ laser (Coherent, Innova 90/5). The back-scattered light from a slowly rotating NMR tube was collected and focussed into a computer-controlled double monochromator (Jobin-Yvon HG 2S) equipped with a cooled photomultiplier (RCA C31034 A) and photon-counting electronics. The resonance Raman spectra were calibrated with indene as a standard to an accuracy of 1 cm−1 for intense isolated bands. Circular dichroism spectra were obtained employing a Jasco J-700 spectropolarimeter at 20 °C. The results are expressed as mean residue ellipticity [θ], which is defined as [θ] = 100 · θobs/lc, where θobs is the observed ellipticity in degrees, c is the concentration in mol of residue per liter, and l is the observation path length in cm. The CD spectra were obtained at a protein concentration of 3 μm with a 0.2-cm path length cell. Below 200 nm the signal-to-noise ratio of the spectrum as well as the quality of the base line was too low to obtain any reasonable information; therefore spectra were collected only in the 200–250 nm range. Absorption spectra were obtained employing a Cary 5 spectrophotometer. At neutral pH the absorption spectrum of oxidized cytochromec"" from M. methylotrophus is characterized by an α band at 553 nm, by a β band at 527 nm, and by an absorption in the Soret region at 406 nm (Fig.1 A), all of which are typical features of an hexa-coordinated low spin (6-coordinated low spin) heme iron, as confirmed by the resonance Raman spectrum (Fig.2), characterized by core-size marker bands (7Choi S.

For further details, see text.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Upon pH lowering, the absorption spectrum remains unchanged until pH 3.5. Further acidification brings about a transition from pH 3.0 to pH 1.5, which is fully reversible. This is a remarkable feature, because it indicates that the conformation of cytochrome c"" at pH 1.5 is a stable one, never going beyond the threshold of a fully reversible structural change. In this respect, circular dichroism spectra have been obtained for oxidized cytochrome c"" at pH 8.2 and 1.4 (Fig. 1, B and C). The α-helical content of cytochrome c"" from M. methylotrophus, as indicated by the ellipticity at 222 nm (see spectrum 1 in Fig. 1 B), does not differ significantly from that reported for cytochrome c from horse heart (8Marmorino J.L. Pielak G.J. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 3140-3143Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). On the other hand, the circular dichroism spectrum of oxidized cytochrome c"" from M. methylotrophus in the visible, Soret, and near UV region is markedly different from that observed for horse heart cytochrome c (Fig. 1 C, spectrum 1). This difference, which mainly consists in the absence of a negative Cotton effect in cytochrome c"" from M. methylotrophus, is not unexpected in view of the fact that in this cytochrome the iron atom is coordinated by two histidines (2Santos H. Turner D.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1988; 954: 276-286Crossref Scopus (26) Google Scholar). It is evident that the pH lowering in M. methylotrophus is accompanied by a marked decrease of the α-helical content (as indicated by the decrease of ellipticity at 222 nm for spectrum 2 in Fig. 1 B) and by an increase of the random coil arrangement (from the increase of ellipticity below 200 nm, seespectrum 2 in Fig. 1 B). Further, the circular dichroic spectrum also shows a change in the Soret and near UV region, mainly represented by a decreased ellipticity, by a blue shift of the maximum value of θ in the Soret region, and by a red-shift in the near-UV region (Fig. 1 C, spectrum 2). A similar change can be observed in the far UV range for horse heart cytochromec, and this species has been identified as an acid-denatured form (8Marmorino J.L. Pielak G.J. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 3140-3143Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). These spectral changes are all fully reversed if the protein is returned to neutral pH (see spectrum 3 in Fig.1 B) or transferred at pH 1.4 into a high ionic strength medium (1 m NaCl, see spectrum 4 in Fig.1 B). Therefore, exposure to low pH reduces the α-helical content of cytochrome c"" toward an unfolded conformation (closely similar to what has been called UA; see Ref. 9Goto Y. Hagihara Y. Hamada D. Hoshino M. Nishii I. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 11878-11885Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar), which reverts to a fully native structure upon raising pH above 3.5 (see spectrum 2 in Fig. 1 B), or it undergoes a transition toward a ”state A“ (9Goto Y. Hagihara Y. Hamada D. Hoshino M. Nishii I. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 11878-11885Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar) upon increasing the ionic strength (see spectrum 4 in Fig. 1 B). Such a state has been described before for cytochrome c from horse heart, and in that case it was proposed that the molecule is characterized by a high level of secondary structure and the absence of tertiary structure most probably because of the charge respulsion related to the widespread protonation of residues at this low pH (10Hagihara Y. Tan Y. Goto Y. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 237: 336-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). On the other hand, recent observations indeed suggest that helix-helix interactions stabilize the state A of horse heart cytochromec (8Marmorino J.L. Pielak G.J. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 3140-3143Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar), indicating that the tertiary structure as well is relevant for the stabilization energy of this intermediate conformation. It is outside the purpose of the present study to dissect the contribution arising from the secondary and the tertiary structural arrangement to the stability of the conformation assumed at acid pH by cytochrome c"" from M. methylotrophus. However, we can outline that in the absence of NaCl the absorption spectrum of the acid-denatured species at pH 1.5 is characterized by a charge transfer band at 622 nm, an α band at 523 nm, a β band at 497 nm (all corresponding to a high spin species) and an absorption band in the Soret region at 394 nm (Fig. 1 A). The corresponding resonance Raman spectrum (Fig. 2) indicates the presence of at least two high spin species (labeled 5-coordinated high spin and 6-coordinated high spin) with bands at 1371 (ν4), 1483 (ν3, 6-coordinated high spin), 1491 (ν3, 5-coordinated high spin), 1574 (ν2, probably due to the overlapping contribution of both high spin species), 1616 (ν10, 6-coordinated high spin), and 1628 cm−1 (ν10, 5-coordinated high spin). All these spectroscopic features indicate that the hexa-coordinated low spin form, present at pH > 3.5, undergoes a conversion to high spin forms at lower pH with one or both histidines being replaced by weak field ligands, such as H2O. Similar absorption and resonance Raman spectroscopic behavior has been observed in horse heart cytochrome c at pH 2.0 in the absence of NaCl (11Jeng M.-F. Englander S.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 221: 1045-1061Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar, 12Goto Y. Takahashi N. Fink A.L. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 3480-3488Crossref PubMed Scopus (573) Google Scholar, 13Jordan T. Eads J.C. Spiro T.G. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 716-728Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). The absorption spectroscopic variation has been followed at low ionic strength between pH 3.5 and 1.5 at 406 and 622 nm, giving a closely similar pattern that can be described by a two proton-linked concerted transition with an apparent pK a of 2.4 ± 0.2 (Fig. 3). Such a behavior indicates the occurrence of a drastic change in the coordination of the heme's iron, which could result either from the cooperative protonation of both His ε2 nitrogens or from the protonation of one His ligand after it has been destabilized by a protonation that disrupts the hydrogen bonding network. The cooperative character of the spectroscopic transition suggests that protonation of one histidine in the oxidized form raises the pK a for the protonation of a second group, thus facilitating the uptake of two protons in a cooperative fashion. The pH-dependent conformational change described above in cytochrome c"" from M. methylotrophus elicited interest in the relationship between the coordination change of the heme iron and reduction properties. At neutral pH, the kinetics of reduction by sodium dithionite is bimolecular and depends on the square root of the reducing agent concentration (Fig.4 A). This observation suggests that the reductant is SO2−, and the observed concentration dependence for the reduction kinetics at pH 7.0 (Fig. 4 A) gives a second order rate constantk = 4.2 (±0.4) × 107m−1 s−1. In the absence of a detailed description of the linkage between protons and sodium dithionite equilibria (5Lambeth D.O. Palmer G. J. Biol. Chem. 1973; 248: 6095-6103Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6Mayhew S.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1978; 85: 535-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar), the pH dependence of the pseudo-first order rate constant for reduction of oxidized cytochrome c"", which has to be referred to the proton-linked equilibria of the oxidized molecule, is reported at a fixed concentration of sodium dithionite, namely 0.2 mm (Fig. 4 B). The pH dependence of k obs is referrable to a proton-linked variation of the intrinsic reduction constantk only (see Equation 1), because (i) a relevant pH dependence of the dissociation constant K (see Equation 1) is not likely over that pH range and (ii) sodium dithionite concentration should not vary significantly at low pH because its exposure to very low pH is limited to a very short time. Therefore, it appears very likely that the pH dependence ofk obs mostly refers to the proton-linked effect on the second order reduction rate constant k (see Equation1) and thus to the protein ionization. The kinetics of reduction by sodium dithionite displays a bell-shaped pH dependence with two protonation events. The first proton-linked transition is characterized by a 6-fold rate enhancement and displays a pK a1 = 5.5 ± 0.3. It is followed by a second proton-linked transition, which displays a less than 2-fold rate decrease and a pK a2 = 2.5 ± 0.3 (Fig. 4 B). The pK a1 value is similar to that obtained in ferricytochrome c"" from M. methylotrophus from observation of the pH dependence of1H NMR chemical shifts (4Costa H.S. Santos H. Turner D.L. Xavier A.V. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 208: 427-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Such a protonation does not induce significant spectral changes, and it can probably be attributed to the protonation of a heme propionate(s) (14Moore G.R. Pettigrew G.W. Pitt R.C. Williams R.J.P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1980; 590: 261-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar), which have already been suggested to be responsible for the “redox Bohr effect” in several cytochromes (15Barakat R. Strekas T.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1982; 679: 393-399Crossref Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 16Jackson J.T. La Mar G.N. Bartsch R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 1799-1805Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Leitch F.A. Moore G.R. Pettigrew G.W. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 1831-1838Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 18Lommen A. Ratsma A. Bijlsma N. Canters G.W. van Wielink J. Frank J. van Beeumen J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 192: 653-661Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Therefore, the behavior reported in Fig.4 B seems to indicate that (i) the negatively charged heme propionic acid decreases the rate of reduction by the negatively charged S2O42− (or SO2−), possibly by electrostatic repulsion, and that (ii) protonation of the heme propionates (or at least of one of them) facilitates the approach of the reducing agent, enhancing the reduction rate. The determination of pK a2 indeed is of particular interest, because it is the first time, to our knowledge, that kinetics of reduction has been carried out over this low pH range on a stable cytochrome. The value of pK a2 (2.5 ± 0.3, see above) from reduction kinetics is closely similar to that obtained on the basis of the electronic absorption spectroscopic transition (of about 2.4 ± 0.2, see Fig. 3), suggesting that the two events are correlated. This being the case, it indicates that the bis-histidine axial coordination, which is present in the oxidized form at pH > 3.5 (Figs. 1 A and 2, and see Ref. 1Costa H.S. Santos H. Turner D.L. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 215: 817-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), is lost at pH < 3.5 and that this event is accompanied by a clear-cut decrease of the reduction rate constant, which is compatible as well with a proton-linked concerted transition (Fig. 4 B), as described for the spectroscopic transition (Fig. 3). In conclusion, the extension of the investigation on the kinetics for the reduction process of cytochrome c"" from M. methylotrophus to an unusually large pH range provides evidence that the reduction of the oxidized cytochrome is regulated by (i) ionization of the heme propionates and by (ii) the axial coordination, such that a “low spin to high spin” transition brings about a decreased reduction rate. The reversible detachment of one of the axial histidines upon reduction is a remarkable feature of this protein (2Santos H. Turner D.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1988; 954: 276-286Crossref Scopus (26) Google Scholar). This study further indicates that at low pH at least one histidine is detached also in the oxidized form, and yet the process is reversible. These data reveal that the structure of the heme pocket in this protein is extraordinarily resilient and that elucidating its structural basis therefore becomes a matter of particular interest for the design of heme enzymes. We thank Prof. A. V. Xavier for several stimulating discussions and encouragement."
