https://openalex.org/W2036650593,"Programmed cell death (apoptosis) occurs during normal development of the central nervous system. However, the mechanisms that determine which neurons will succumb to apoptosis are poorly understood. Blockade of N -methyl- d -aspartate (NMDA) glutamate receptors for only a few hours during late fetal or early neonatal life triggered widespread apoptotic neurodegeneration in the developing rat brain, suggesting that the excitatory neurotransmitter glutamate, acting at NMDA receptors, controls neuronal survival. These findings may have relevance to human neurodevelopmental disorders involving prenatal (drug-abusing mothers) or postnatal (pediatric anesthesia) exposure to drugs that block NMDA receptors."

Genes could be clustered into groups on the basis of their temporal patterns of expression in this program. Many features of the transcriptional program appeared to be related to the physiology of wound repair, suggesting that fibroblasts play a larger and richer role in this complex multicellular response than had previously been appreciated."

https://openalex.org/W1979539191,"A fundamental task of language acquisition is to extract abstract algebraic rules. Three experiments show that 7-month-old infants attend longer to sentences with unfamiliar structures than to sentences with familiar structures. The design of the artificial language task used in these experiments ensured that this discrimination could not be performed by counting, by a system that is sensitive only to transitional probabilities, or by a popular class of simple neural network models. Instead, these results suggest that infants can represent, extract, and generalize abstract algebraic rules."

https://openalex.org/W2018136364,"Liquid microchannels on structured surfaces are built up using a wettability pattern consisting of hydrophilic stripes on a hydrophobic substrate. These channels undergo a shape instability at a certain amount of adsorbed volume, from a homogeneous state with a spatially constant cross section to a state with a single bulge. This instability is quite different from the classical Rayleigh Plateau instability and represents a bifurcation between two different morphologies of constant mean curvature. The bulge state can be used to construct channel networks that could be used as fluid microchips or microreactors."

https://openalex.org/W2061714407,"The genome of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is packaged within an unusual conical core particle located at the center of the infectious virion. The core is composed of a complex of the NC (nucleocapsid) protein and genomic RNA, surrounded by a shell of the CA (capsid) protein. A method was developed for assembling cones in vitro using pure recombinant HIV-1 CA-NC fusion proteins and RNA templates. These synthetic cores are capped at both ends and appear similar in size and morphology to authentic viral cores. It is proposed that both viral and synthetic cores are organized on conical hexagonal lattices, which by Euler's theorem requires quantization of their cone angles. Electron microscopic analyses revealed that the cone angles of synthetic cores were indeed quantized into the five allowed angles. The viral core and most synthetic cones exhibited cone angles of approximately 19 degrees (the narrowest of the allowed angles). These observations suggest that the core of HIV is organized on the principles of a fullerene cone, in analogy to structures recently observed for elemental carbon."
https://openalex.org/W2045573038,Molecular recognition based on length was found to occur between oppositely charged pairs of flexible and randomly coiled block copolymers in an aqueous milieu. Matched pairs with the same block lengths of polyanions and polycations exclusively formed even in mixtures with different block lengths. These assemblies of the charged segments with matched chain lengths then formed larger core-shell–type supramolecular assemblies with an extremely narrow size distribution due to the strict phase separation between core- and shell-forming segments.
https://openalex.org/W2084240593,"Recently, GBR1, a seven-transmembrane domain protein with high affinity for gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)B receptor antagonists, was identified. Here, a GBR1-related protein, GBR2, was shown to be coexpressed with GBR1 in many brain regions and to interact with it through a short domain in the carboxyl-terminal cytoplasmic tail. Heterologously expressed GBR2 mediated inhibition of adenylyl cyclase; however, inwardly rectifying potassium channels were activated by GABAB receptor agonists only upon coexpression with GBR1 and GBR2. Thus, the interaction of these receptors appears to be crucial for important physiological effects of GABA and provides a mechanism in receptor signaling pathways that involve a heterotrimeric GTP-binding protein."

https://openalex.org/W1804813305,"There is strong evidence to show that diabetes is associated with increased oxidative stress. However, the source of this oxidative stress remains unclear. Using transgenic mice that overexpress aldose reductase (AR) in their lenses, we found that the flux of glucose through the polyol pathway is the major cause of hyperglycemic oxidative stress in this tissue. The substantial decrease in the level of reduced glutathione (GSH) with concomitant rise in the level of lipid peroxidation product malondialdehyde (MDA) in the lens of transgenic mice, but not in the nontransgenic mice, suggests that glucose autoxidation and nonenzymatic glycation do not contribute significantly to oxidative stress in diabetic lenses. AR reduction of glucose to sorbitol probably contributes to oxidative stress by depleting its cofactor NADPH, which is also required for the regeneration of GSH. Sorbitol dehydrogenase, the second enzyme in the polyol pathway that converts sorbitol to fructose, also contributes to oxidative stress, most likely because depletion of its cofactor NAD+ leads to more glucose being channeled through the polyol pathway. Despite a more than 100% increase of MDA, oxidative stress plays only a minor role in the development of cataract in this acute diabetic cataract model. However, chronic oxidative stress generated by the polyol pathway is likely to be an important contributing factor in the slow-developing diabetic cataract as well as in the development of other diabetic complications.—Lee, A. Y. W., Chung, S. S. M. Contributions of polyol pathway to oxidative stress in diabetic cataract. FASEB J. 13, 23–30 (1999)"

Surfactant species generated at one electrode and consumed at another were used to manipulate the magnitude and direction of spatial gradients in surface tension and guide droplets of organic liquids through simple fluidic networks. Solid microparticles could be transported across unconfined surfaces. Electrochemical control of the position of surface-active species within aqueous films of liquid supported on homogeneous surfaces was used to direct these films into periodic arrays of droplets with deterministic shapes and sizes.

CmPP16 messenger RNA (mRNA) is present in phloem tissue, whereas protein appears confined to sieve elements (SE). Microinjection and grafting studies revealed that CmPP16 moves from cell to cell, mediates the transport of sense and antisense RNA, and moves together with its mRNA into the SE of scion tissue. CmPP16 possesses the characteristics that are likely required to mediate RNA delivery into the long-distance translocation stream. Thus, RNA may move within the phloem as a component of a plant information superhighway."

Along the planetary isentrope water and ammonia behave as fully dissociated ionic, electronically insulating fluid phases, which turn metallic at temperatures exceeding 7000 kelvin for water and 5500 kelvin for ammonia. At lower temperatures, the phase diagrams of water and ammonia exhibit a superionic solid phase between the solid and the ionic liquid. These simulations improve our understanding of the properties of the middle ice layers of Neptune and Uranus."

https://openalex.org/W1669956823,"Signaling by the Notch surface receptor controls cell fate determination in a broad spectrum of tissues. This signaling is triggered by the interaction of the Notch protein with what, so far, have been thought to be transmembrane ligands expressed on adjacent cells. Here biochemical and genetic analyses show that the ligand Delta is cleaved on the surface, releasing an extracellular fragment capable of binding to Notch and acting as an agonist of Notch activity. The ADAM disintegrin metalloprotease Kuzbanian is required for this processing event. These observations raise the possibility that Notch signaling in vivo is modulated by soluble forms of the Notch ligands."

Scanning tunneling microscopy was used to observe the electronic wave functions that correspond to quantized energy levels in short metallic carbon nanotubes. Discrete electron waves were apparent from periodic oscillations in the differential conductance as a function of the position along the tube axis, with a period that differed from that of the atomic lattice. Wave functions could be observed for several electron states at adjacent discrete energies. The measured wavelengths are in good agreement with the calculated Fermi wavelength for armchair nanotubes."

This system was based on the expression of two chimeric, human-derived proteins that were reconstituted by rapamycin into a transcription factor complex. A mixture of two adeno-associated virus vectors, one expressing the transcription factor chimeras and one containing erythropoietin (Epo) under the control of a promoter responsive to the transcription factor, was injected into skeletal muscle of immune-competent mice. Administration of rapamycin resulted in 200-fold induction of plasma Epo. Stable engraftment of this humanized system in immune-competent mice was achieved for 6 months with similar results for at least 3 months in a rhesus monkey."
https://openalex.org/W2114684542,The appearance of inflammatory markers associated with amyloid plaques indicates a state of chronic inflammation in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Multiple epidemiological studies also suggest that patients taking anti-inflammatory drugs have a decreased risk of developing AD. Here we present evidence that inflammatory cytokines can alter the metabolism of the beta-amyloid precursor protein (betaAPP). We show that the combination of tumor necrosis factor alpha and interferon gamma triggers the production of beta-amyloid peptides and inhibits the secretion of soluble APPs by human neuronal and extraneuronal cells. The results demonstrate a new mechanism by which inflammatory components can exacerbate the fundamental pathology in AD.
https://openalex.org/W2042137196,"Analysis of the interlayer infrared conductivity of cuprate high–transition temperature superconductors reveals an anomalously large energy scale extending up to midinfrared frequencies that can be attributed to formation of the superconducting condensate. This unusual effect is observed in a va- riety of materials, including Tl 2 Ba 2 CuO 6+ x , La 2− x Sr x CuO 4 , and YBa 2 Cu 3 O 6.6 , which show an incoherent interlayer response in the normal state. Midinfrared range condensation was examined in the context of sum rules that can be formulated for the complex conductivity. One possible interpretation of these experiments is in terms of a kinetic energy change associated with the superconducting transition."
https://openalex.org/W1752756141,"Static magnetic fields with intensities starting from 6 gauss (6x10(-4) tesla, T) were found to decrease in an intensity-dependent fashion, reaching a plateau at 6 x 10(-3) T, the extent of cell death by apoptosis induced by several agents in different human cell systems. This is not due to a change in the mode of cell death (i.e., to necrosis) or to a delay of the process itself; rather, the presence of magnetic fields allows the indefinite survival and replication of the cells hit by apoptogenic agents. The protective effect was found to be mediated by the ability of the fields to enhance Ca2+ influx from the extracellular medium; accordingly, it was limited to those cell systems where Ca2+ influx was shown to have an antiapoptotic effect. Magnetic fields thus might interfere with human health by altering/restoring the equilibrium between cell death and proliferation; indeed, the rescue of damaged cells may be the mechanism explaining why magnetic fields that are not mutagenic per se are often able to increase mutation and tumor frequencies."
https://openalex.org/W2080565933,"STAT proteins are activated by phosphorylation at specific tyrosine residue at the carboxy-terminus which is required for dimer-formation, nuclear translocation, DNA binding and transcriptional activity in cells treated with cytokines and growth factors. Recent studies have indicated that STATs are also phosphorylated by MAPK, or extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) on serine. We investigated the role of ERK on the regulation of STAT activity. Here, we report that ERK2 activated by its upstream kinase, MEK1, represses Stat3 transcriptional activity induced by Src or Jak-2. To unravel the mechanism of repression, we further showed that Stat3 DNA binding activity and its tyrosine phosphorylation are also inhibited under the same conditions. ERK2 phosphorylates Stat3 on three serine-containing peptides and decreases its tyrosine phosphorylation induced by EGF treatment. We also detected an association of ERK2 and Stat3 in vivo which is modulated positively by activation of ERK2, but negatively by Jak2. We propose that MAP kinase cascade may negatively regulate Stat3 activities by decreasing its tyrosine phosphorylation and also possibly by association."
https://openalex.org/W2030156644,"Episodes of elevated bromine oxide (BrO) concentration are known to occur at high latitudes in the Arctic boundary layer and to lead to catalytic destruction of ozone at those latitudes; these events have not been observed at lower latitudes. With the use of differential optical absorption spectroscopy (DOAS), locally high BrO concentrations were observed at mid-latitudes at the Dead Sea, Israel, during spring 1997. Mixing ratios peaked daily at around 80 parts per trillion around noon and were correlated with low boundary-layer ozone mixing ratios."
https://openalex.org/W1925429192,"It has been reported in several cell lines that exposure to low levels of reactive oxygen species can exert a stimulatory effect on their proliferation. We have previously shown that mild oxidative conditions can also counteract apoptotic stimuli. A constitutive cellular production of low levels of superoxide and hydrogen peroxide originates from various sources; among these, gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT), the plasma membrane-bound activity in charge of metabolizing extracellular reduced glutathione, has recently been included. Since the inhibition of GGT is a sufficient stimulus for the induction of apoptosis in selected cell lines, we investigated whether this effect might result from the suppression of the mentioned GGT-dependent prooxidant reactions, on the theory that the latter may represent a basal antiapoptotic and proliferative signal for the cell. Experiments showed that: 1) GGT activity in U937 monoblastoid cells is associated with the production of low levels of hydrogen peroxide, and two independent GGT inhibitors cause a dose-dependent decrease of such GGT-dependent production of H2O2; 2) GGT inhibition with acivicin results in cell growth arrest, and induces cell death and DNA fragmentation with the ladder appearance of apoptosis; 3) treatment of cells with catalase--and even more with Trolox C--is able to decrease their proliferative rate; 4) GGT inhibition (with suppression of H2O2 production) results in a down-regulation of poly(ADP-ribose) polimerase (PARP) activity, which precedes the proteolytic cleavage of PARP molecule, such as that typically induced by caspases. The reported data suggest that the low H2O2 levels originating as a by-product during GGT activity are able to act as sort of a 'life signal' in U937 cells, insofar as they can maintain cell proliferation and protect against apoptosis, possibly through an up-regulation of PARP activity."
https://openalex.org/W2323083017,"Germ-line alterations of BRCA1 are responsible for about 50% of familial breast cancers. Although its biological function(s) has not yet been fully determined, it has been suggested that it may act as a tumor suppressor gene in breast and ovarian cancers. In sporadic breast cancers alterations of BRCA1 have not been detected and in vitro experiments have indicated that BRCA1 negatively regulates cellular proliferation. The present study was designed to identify and quantify, the BRCA1 mRNA levels, in normal and neoplasic human breast tissue. BRCA1 mRNA molecules were quantified using competitive reverse transcriptase PCR assays. DNA methylation patterns of this gene have been analysed by Southern blot experiments using methylation sensitive restriction enzymes. We found that BRCA1 mRNA levels were significantly lower in sporadic breast cancers (37 cases analysed, 24 cases of invasive ductal carcinomas not otherwise specified (NOS), two lobular carcinomas in situ two medullary carcinomas, four invasive lobular carcinomas, two invasive mucinous carcinomas and three invasive ductal carcinomas with predominantly in situ component) compared with normal breast tissues (P=0.0003). This down-regulation of BRCA1 is observed in all histologic types analysed. In invasive ductal carcinomas NOS, this down-regulation does not correlate with any of the prognostic factors studied (tumor size, node status, histologic grade, hormone receptor status). In the samples analysed, alterations of DNA methylation patterns were not dectected in the vicinity of the major transcription start site. These data suggest the involvement of BRCA1 in the carcinogenesis of these histologic types."
https://openalex.org/W2322237813,"Cyclin T1 has been identified recently as a regulatory subunit of CDK9 and as a component of the transcription elongation factor P-TEFb. Cyclin T1/CDK9 complexes phosphorylate the carboxy terminal domain (CTD) of RNA polymerase II (RNAP II) in vitro. Here we report that the levels of cyclin T1 are dramatically upregulated by two independent signaling pathways triggered respectively by PMA and PHA in primary human peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBLs). Activation of these two pathways in tandem is sufficient for PBLs to enter and progress through the cell cycle. However, the expression of cyclin T1 is not growth and/or cell cycle regulated in other cell types, indicating that regulation of cyclin T1 expression is dependent on tissue-specific signaling pathways. Upregulation of cyclin T1 in stimulated PBLs results in induction of the CTD kinase activity of the cyclin T1/CDK9 complex, which in turn correlates directly with phosphorylation of RNAP II in vivo, linking for the first time activation of the cyclin T1/CDK9 pair with phosphorylation of RNAP II in vivo. In addition, we report here that endogenous CDK9 and cyclin T1 complexes associate with HIV-1 generated Tat in relevant cells and under physiological conditions (HIV-1 infected T cells). This, together with our results showing that HIV-1 replication in stimulated PBLs correlates with the levels of cyclin T1 protein and associated CTD kinase activity, suggests that the cyclin T1/CDK9 pair is one of the HIV-1 required host cellular cofactors generated during T cell activation."
https://openalex.org/W1829426772,"Avian embryos and neonates acquire passive immunity by transferring maternal immunoglobulins from serum to egg yolk. Despite being a convenient source of antibodies, egg yolk immunoglobulins (IgY) from immunized hens have so far received scant attention in research. Here we report the generation and rapid isolation of IgY from the egg yolk of hens immunized against the α subunit of the human hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1α). Anti-HIF-1α IgY antibodies were affinity purified and tested for their performance in various applications. Abundant HIF-1α protein was detected by Western blot analysis in nuclear extracts derived from hypoxic cells of human, mouse, monkey, swine, and dog origin whereas in hypoxic quail and frog cells, the HIF-1α signal was weak or absent, respectively. In electro-phoretic mobility shift assays, affinity-purified IgY antibody was shown to recognize the native HIF-1 (but not the related HIF-2) complex that specifically binds an oligonucleotide containing the HIF-1 DNAbinding site. Furthermore, IgY antibody immunoprecipitated HIF-1α from hypoxic cell extracts. Immunofluorescence experiments using IgY antibody allowed the detection of HIF-1α in the nucleus of hypoxic COS-7 cells. For comparison, the application of a mouse monoclonal antibody raised against the identical HIF-1 α fragment was more restricted. Because chicken housing is inexpensive, egg collection is noninvasive, isolation and affinity purification of IgY antibodies are fast and simple, and the applicability of IgY is widespread, immunization of hens represents an excellent alternative for the generation of polyclonal antibodies. —Camenisch, G., Tini, M., Chilov, D., Kvietikova, I., Srinivas, V., Caro, J., Spielmann, P., Wenger, R.

https://openalex.org/W2066078821,"Whether a single major histocompatibility complex (MHC)–bound peptide can drive the positive selection of large numbers of T cells has been a controversial issue. A diverse population of self peptides was shown to be essential for the in vivo development of CD4 T cells. Mice in which all but 5 percent of MHC class II molecules were bound by a single peptide had wild-type numbers of CD4 T cells. However, when the diversity within this 5 percent was lost, CD4 T cell development was impaired. Blocking the major peptide–MHC complex in thymus organ culture had no effect on T cell development, indicating that positive selection occurred on the diverse peptides present at low levels. This requirement for peptide diversity indicates that the interaction between self peptides and T cell receptors during positive selection is highly specific."
https://openalex.org/W2076886801,"Shc proteins are important substrates of receptor and cytoplasmic tyrosine kinases that couple activated receptors to downstream signaling enzymes. Phosphorylation of Shc tyrosine residues 239 and 317 leads to recruitment of the Grb2-Sos complex, thus linking Shc phosphorylation to Ras activation. We have used phosphorylated peptides corresponding to the regions spanning tyrosine 239/240 and 317 of Shc in an expression library screen to identify additional downstream targets of Shc. Here we report the identification of Gads, a novel adaptor protein most similar to Grb2 and Grap that contains amino and carboxy terminal SH3 domains flanking a central SH2 domain and a 120 amino acid unique region. Gads is most highly expressed in the thymus and spleen of adult animals and in human leukemic cell lines. The binding specificity of the Gads SH2 domain is similar to Grb2 and mediates the interaction of Gads with Shc, Bcr-Abl and c-kit. Gads does not interact with Sos, Cbl or Sam68, although the isolated carboxy terminal Gads SH3 domain is able to bind these molecules in vitro. Our results suggest that the unique structure of Gads regulates its interaction with downstream SH3 domain-binding proteins and that Gads may function to couple tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins such as Shc, Bcr-Abl and activated receptor tyrosine kinases to downstream effectors distinct from Sos and Ras"
https://openalex.org/W1512966860,"With the aim of interrupting the growth factor-stimulated Ras signaling pathway at the level of the Grb2–Sos interaction, a peptidimer, made of two identical proline-rich sequences from Sos linked by a lysine spacer, was designed using structural data from Grb2 and a proline-rich peptide complexed with its SH3 domains. The peptidimer affinity for Grb2 is 40 nM whereas that of the monomer is 16 μM, supporting the dual recognition of both Grb2 SH3 domains by the dimer. At 50 nM, the peptidimer blocks selectively Grb2–Sos complexation in ER 22 (CCL 39 fibroblasts overexpressing epidermal growth factor receptor) cellular extracts. The peptidimer specifically recognizes Grb2 and does not interact with PI3K or Nck, two SH3 domam-containing adaptors. The peptidimer was modified to enter cells by coupling to a fragment of Antennapedia homeo-domain. At 10 μM, the conjugate inhibits the Grb2–Sos interaction (100%) and MAP kinase (ERK1 and ERK2) phosphorylation (60%) without modifying cellular growth of ER 22 cells. At the same concentration, the conjugate also inhibits both MAP kinase activation induced by nerve growth factor or epidermal growth factor in PC12 cells, and differentiation triggered by nerve growth factor. Finally, when tested for its antiproliferative activity, the conjugate was an efficient inhibitor of the colony formation of transformed NIH3T3/HER2 cells grown in soft agar, with an IC50 of around 1 μM. Thus, the designed peptidimers appear to be interesting leads to investigate signaling and intracellular processes and for designing selective inhibitors of tumorigenic Ras-dependent processes.—Cussac, D., Vidal, M., LePrince, C., Liu, W.-Q., Cornille, F., Tiraboschi, G., Roques, B.

https://openalex.org/W2335627417,"Nucleic acid immunization has been investigated as immunotherapy for infectious diseases as well as for treating specific types of cancers. In this approach, nucleic acid expression cassettes are directly inoculated into the host, whose transfected cells become the production source of novel and possibly immunologically foreign protein. We have developed a DNA vaccine construct which encodes for PSA by cloning a cDNA for PSA into a mammalian expression vector under control of a CMV promoter. We investigated and characterized the immunogenicity of PSA DNA expression cassettes in mice. PSA-specific immune responses induced in vivo by immunization were characterized by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), T helper proliferation cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL), and flow cytometry assays. We observed a strong and persistent antibody response against PSA for at least 180 days following immunization. In addition, a significant T helper cell proliferation was observed against PSA protein. Using synthetic peptides spanning the PSA open frame, we identified four dominant T helper epitopes of PSA. Furthermore, immunization with PSA plasmid induced MHC Class I CD8+ T cell-restricted cytotoxic T lymphocyte response against tumor cell targets expressing PSA. The prostate represents a very specific functional organ critical for reproduction but not for the health and survival of the individual. Understanding the immunogenicity of PSA DNA immunization cassettes offers insight into the possible use of this tumor-associated antigen as a target for immunotherapy. These results demonstrate the ability of the genetic PSA to serve as a specific immune target capable of generating both humoral and cellular immune responses in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W1606718563,"The unmethylated status of the CpG islands is important for gene expression of correlated housekeeping genes since it is well known that their methylation inhibits transcription process. An interesting question that has been discussed but not solved is how the CpG islands maintain their characteristic unmethylated status even though they are rich in CpG dinucleotides. Our previous in vitro and in vivo research has shown that poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation is involved in protecting CpG dinucleotides from full methylation in genomic DNA and that a block of poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation is also involved in modifying the methylation pattern in the promoter region of Htf9 housekeeping gene. In this study we locked for cytological evidence that in the absence of an active poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation the DNA methylation pattern in L929 and NIH/3T3 mouse fibroblast cell lines is altered. For this purpose, differences in the methylation levels of interphase nuclei from control and treated cultures of two murine cell lines preincubated with 2 mM 3-aminobenzamide, an inhibitor of poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation, were measured in individual cells after indirect immunolabeling with anti-5MeC antibodies. The quantitative analysis allowed us to demonstrate that blocking of the poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation results in a higher number, size, and density of antibody binding regions in treated cells when compared to the controls. Analogously, sequential Giemsa staining and indirect immunolabeling of the same slides showed the hetero-chromatic regions colocalized with the extended methyl-rich domains.—de Capoa, A., Febbo, F.

https://openalex.org/W1931474544,"Laminin-1 is a basement membrane glycoprotein that promotes several biological activities including cell attachment, tumor metastasis, and angiogenesis. Angiogenesis plays an important role in tissue formation, reproduction, wound healing, and several pathological conditions. In this study, we screened 405 synthetic peptides from the alpha1 and beta1 chains to identify potential sites on laminin-1 active with endothelial cells. Peptides were initially screened by testing both endothelial cell adhesion to peptide-coated wells and tube formation on Matrigel in the presence of soluble peptide. Twenty active peptides were identified in these screens. A secondary screen using the rat aortic ring sprouting assay identified 13 of the 20 peptides that stimulated endothelial sprouting. Several of these active peptides were also found to stimulate human umbilical vein endothelial cell migration in Boyden chamber assays. Differences in the amount of peptide needed for the response and in the resultant morphologies/responses were observed between the peptides in all of the assays. Our results suggest that several active domains on laminin-1 may play important roles in stimulating different steps in angiogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W1548361495,"Aging is commonly associated with dysregulation of the hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal axis and cognitive impairment. On the basis of suggestions that these disruptions ensue from changes in the hippocampal complement of corticosteroid (mineralocorticoid and glucocorticoid) receptors (MR and GR), we examined the availability of hippocampal MR and GR by measuring the in vivo uptake of 3H-aldosterone and 3H-dexamethasone (selective MR and GR agonists, respectively); MR and GR mRNA levels were also measured. We observed age-related declines in both the synthesis of MR and GR and the uptake of their respective ligands. Whereas MR mRNA levels and ligand uptake declined in parallel, GR binding declined more steeply than GR mRNA. This latter result, together with our finding that aged rats show impaired corticosteroid receptor mRNA and protein up-regulation after corticosteroid withdrawal, indicates decreased transcription of MR and GR genes and posttranslational modification of GR mRNA during aging. Given that corticosteroids can influence MR and GR synthesis and binding, and based on the finding that aged subjects show reduced basal secretion of corticosterone, we propose that this relative hypocorticalism may be responsible for the changes observed in MR and GR activity, which then leads to disturbances in neuroendocrine regulation and cognitive function in aged subjects.—Hassan, A.

https://openalex.org/W1488755326,"Acute hyperglycemia may contribute to the progression of atherosclerosis by regulating protein kinase C (PKC) isozymes and by accelerating vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) proliferation. We investigated acute glucose regulation of PKCbeta gene expression in A10 cells, a rat aortic smooth muscle cell line. Western blot analysis showed that PKCbetaII protein levels decreased with high glucose (25 mM) compared to normal glucose (5.5 mM), whereas PKCbetaI levels were unaltered. PKCbeta mRNA levels were depleted by 60-75% in hyperglycemic conditions. To elucidate whether high glucose regulated PKCbeta expression via the common promoter for PKCbetaI and PKCbetaII, deletion constructs of the PKCbeta promoter ligated to CAT as reporter gene were transfected into A10 cells. Construct D (-411 to +179CAT) showed quenching in high glucose (25 mM) and suggested the involvement of a carbohydrate response element in the 5' promoter region of the PKCbeta gene. In actinomycin D-treated A10 cells, a 60% decrease in PKCbeta mRNA with high glucose treatment indicated that posttranscriptional destabilization by glucose was also occurring. We have demonstrated that glucose-induced posttranscriptional destabilization of PKCbetaII message is mediated via a nuclease activity present in the cytosol. The specificity of glucose to posttranscriptionally destabilize PKCbetaII mRNA, but not the PKCbetaI mRNA, was confirmed in both A10 cells and primary cultures from human aorta."

In this study, we have examined the consequences of erbB-2 depletion on DNA repair, cell cycle, and apoptosis using a panel of NSCLC cell lines constitutively overexpressing erbB-2 receptor. Depletion of the erbB-2 was achieved using the tyrosine kinase inhibitor CP127,374 which promotes erbB-2 degradation. Treatment with CP127,374 concentrations which deplete erbB-2 and inhibit tyrosine phosphorylation resulted in downregulation of DNA repair mechanisms and cell accumulation at G1 phase of the cell cycle. G1 arrest was observed in cells with mutated p53 as well as cells lacking p53 protein, suggesting a p53-independent mechanisms. NSCLC cells which overexpress erbB-2 were more resistant to cisplatin-induced cytotoxicity in comparison to cells expressing low levels of erbB-2. Treatment with CP127,374 alone did not result in any induction of apoptosis. A combination of CP127,374 and cisplatin, however, was more potent in cell growth inhibition and induction of apoptosis compared to treatment with cisplatin alone. Together, our results further support a pivotal role of erbB-2 signaling in the regulatory balance between DNA repair, cell cycle checkpoints and apoptosis; all these mechanisms are essential determinants for tumor cell destiny following chemotherapy stress."

https://openalex.org/W1972733939,"A quantum statistical treatment of the chemical exchange between molecular eigenstates or conformations revealed previously unsuspected dynamic terms in the spin Hamiltonian operator that describes fast exchange. These terms resulted from the effect of nuclear spin on rotational and vibrational relaxation. With the traditional theory, an interpretation of new carbon-13 nuclear magnetic resonance measurements of the chemical shift of methylcyclohexane in solution showed fast-exchange equilibrium constants that were inconsistent with the slow-exchange free-energy difference and were spread over a range of 30 percent for the various carbon-13 positions. Modeling of the new terms indicated that they have the correct magnitude and temperature dependence to reconcile these inconsistencies."
