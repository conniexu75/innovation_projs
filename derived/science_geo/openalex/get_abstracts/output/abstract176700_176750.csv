https://openalex.org/W1996788021,"Embryonic morphogenesis is driven by a suite of cell behaviours, including coordinated shape changes, cellular rearrangements and individual cell migrations, whose molecular determinants are largely unknown. In the zebrafish, Dani rerio, trilobite mutant embryos have defects in gastrulation movements and posterior migration of hindbrain neurons. Here, we have used positional cloning to demonstrate that trilobite mutations disrupt the transmembrane protein Strabismus (Stbm)/Van Gogh (Vang), previously associated with planar cell polarity (PCP) in Drosophila melanogaster, and PCP and canonical Wnt/beta-catenin signalling in vertebrates. Our genetic and molecular analyses argue that during gastrulation, trilobite interacts with the PCP pathway without affecting canonical Wnt signalling. Furthermore, trilobite may regulate neuronal migration independently of PCP molecules. We show that trilobite mediates polarization of distinct movement behaviours. During gastrulation convergence and extension movements, trilobite regulates mediolateral cell polarity underlying effective intercalation and directed dorsal migration at increasing velocities. In the hindbrain, trilobite controls effective migration of branchiomotor neurons towards posterior rhombomeres. Mosaic analyses show trilobite functions cell-autonomously and non-autonomously in gastrulae and the hindbrain. We propose Trilobite/Stbm mediates cellular interactions that confer directionality on distinct movements during vertebrate embryogenesis."

To understand further the mechanism of regulation of ceramide synthesis, we now characterize a mammalian homolog of LAG1,upstream of growth and differentiation factor-1 (uog1). cDNA clones of uog1 were obtained from expression sequence-tagged clones and sub-cloned into a mammalian expression vector. Transient transfection of human embryonic kidney 293T cells with uog1 followed by metabolic labeling with [4,5-3H]sphinganine orl-3-[3H]serine demonstrated thatuog1 conferred fumonisin B1 resistance with respect to the ability of the cells to continue to produce ceramide. Surprisingly, this ceramide was channeled into neutral glycosphingolipids but not into gangliosides. Electrospray tandem mass spectrometry confirmed the elevation in sphingolipids and revealed that the ceramides and neutral glycosphingolipids ofuog1-transfected cells contain primarily stearic acid (C18), that this enrichment was further increased by FB1, and that the amount of stearic acid in sphingomyelin was also increased. UOG1 was localized to the endoplasmic reticulum, demonstrating that the fatty acid selectivity and the fumonisin B1 resistance are not due to a subcellular localization different from that found previously for ceramide synthase activity. Furthermore, in vitro assays ofuog1-transfected cells demonstrated elevated ceramide synthase activity when stearoyl-CoA but not palmitoyl-CoA was used as substrate. We propose a role for UOG1 in regulating C18-ceramide (N-stearoyl-sphinganine) synthesis, and we note that not only is this the first case of ceramide formation in mammalian cells with such a high degree of fatty acid specificity, but also that theN-stearoyl-sphinganine produced by UOG1 most significantly impacts neutral glycosphingolipid synthesis.

Interest in determining the regulatory mechanisms of ceramide metabolism has been stimulated over the past decade by the realization that ceramides formed by turnover of complex sphingolipids, and byde novo synthesis, influence key aspects of cell growth, regulation, differentiation, and death (1Spiegel S.

Ceramides are formedde novo by N-acylation of sphinganine to dihydroceramide, which is subsequently desaturated by dihydroceramide desaturase (7Merrill A.H. Wang E. J. Biol.

The N-acyltransferase(s), which are referred to herein as (dihydro)ceramide synthase(s), acylate various long chain bases, including sphinganine, sphingosine, and 4-hydroxysphinganine, utilize a wide spectrum of fatty acyl-CoAs, and are inhibited by the mycotoxin, fumonisin B1(FB1) 1The abbreviations used are: FB1, fumonisin B1; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; ESI-MS/MS, electrospray tandem mass spectrometry; GlcCer, glucosylceramide; GSL, glycosphingolipid; HA, hemagglutinin; PDI, protein-disulfide isomerase; SM, sphingomyelin; HEK, human embryonic kidney. 1The abbreviations used are: FB1, fumonisin B1; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; ESI-MS/MS, electrospray tandem mass spectrometry; GlcCer, glucosylceramide; GSL, glycosphingolipid; HA, hemagglutinin; PDI, protein-disulfide isomerase; SM, sphingomyelin; HEK, human embryonic kidney.

Kinetic evidence has been obtained for multiple (dihydro)ceramide synthases, but no biochemical or molecular evidence has been obtained to prove their existence. One reason for suggesting that multiple (dihydro)ceramide synthases exist is that FB1 suppresses the synthesis of most, but not all, sphingolipids in vivo, and the residual ceramide formed is preferentially channeled into glycosphingolipids (GSLs) rather than sphingomyelin (SM) (13Merrill Jr., A.H. van Echten G.

Furthermore, ceramide synthesis is thought to occur primarily in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) (16Hirschberg K. Rodger J. Futerman A.H. Biochem.

Bull. 1995; 10: 1335-1339Crossref Scopus (29) Google Scholar) have suggested that ceramide can also be made in a mitochondria-enriched fraction. Until more tools are available to study (dihydro)ceramide synthases, the causes of such differences will remain obscure. This issue is further complicated by the ability to bypass FB1inhibition by formation of ceramide via the reverse activity of an acyl-CoA-independent ceramidase (20El Bawab S. Birbes H. Roddy P.

Pfefferli M. Jiang J.C. Jazwinski S.M. Conzelmann A. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 2655-2665Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar) demonstrated that the yeast genes, LAG1(22D'Mello N, P. Childress A.M. Franklin D.S. Kale S.P. Pinswasdi C. Jazwinski S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15451-15459Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and LAC1, are required for acyl-CoA-dependent ceramide synthesis using very long chain (C26) fatty acids. Yeast strains lacking Lag1p and Lac1p produce greatly reduced levels of ceramides and lack FB1-sensitive ceramide synthase activity (23Schorling S. Vallee B. Barz W.P. Riezman H. Oesterhelt D. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 3417-3427Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). Moreover, LAG1 regulates glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored protein transport from the ER to the Golgi apparatus in yeast (24Barz W.P. Walter P. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 1043-1059Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), a step that depends on ceramide synthesis (25Horvath A. Sütterlin C. Manning-Krieg U. Movva N.R. Riezman H.

Trends Cell Biol. 1995; 5: 377-380Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), supporting the idea that the yeast genes either encode for a catalytic subunit of ceramide synthase or are obligatory activators of ceramide synthase (21Guillas I.

Finally, a tomato gene homolog of LAG1, the Alternaria stem canker locus-1 (ASC1), mediates FB1 resistance in tomato (27Brandwagt B.F. Mesbah L.A. Takken F.L. Laurent P.L. Kneppers T.J. Hille J. Nijkamp H.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 4961-4966Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar), implying that ASC1 might encode a FB1-insensitive (dihydro)ceramide synthase in plants (28Brandwagt B.F. Kneppers T.J. Nijkamp H.J. Hille J. Mol. Plant-Microbe Interact. 2002; 15: 35-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). In the current study, we examine the effect of overexpression of a mouse homolog of LAG1, upstream ofgrowth and differentiation factor-1(uog1) (29Jiang J.C. Kirchman P.A. Zagulski M. Hunt J. Jazwinski S.M. Genome Res. 1998; 8: 1259-1272Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 30Boyer J. Pascolo S. Richard G.F. Dujon B. Yeast. 1993; 9: 279-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar), in mammalian cells. uog1 was originally discovered while screening for transforming growth factor-β family members, and was found to be expressed in various tissues as part of a bicistronic RNA together with growth/differentiation factor-1 (gdf1) (31Lee S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 4250-4254Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Moreover, it functionally complemented the lethality of a LAG1 andLAC1 double deletion in yeast (29Jiang J.C. Kirchman P.A. Zagulski M. Hunt J. Jazwinski S.M. Genome Res. 1998; 8: 1259-1272Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). We now show that transfection with uog1 increased, in a FB1-insensitive manner, (dihydro)ceramide synthesis, which was subsequently preferentially channeled into neutral but not acidic GSLs. Unexpectedly, the ceramide and neutral GSLs formed were greatly enriched in C18- (stearoyl) fatty acids. Our data establish that UOG1 is involved in the regulation ofN-stearoyl-sphinganine synthesis in mammalian cells, and we demonstrate for the first time that cells can synthesize ceramides with a high degree of fatty acid selectivity as a result of the increased expression of a single gene product. l-3-[3H]Serine (specific activity of 26 or 31 Ci/mmol) and [14C]methylcholine (specific activity of 56 mCi/mmol) were from Amersham Biosciences. Ceramide, FB1, glucosylceramide (GlcCer), galactosylceramide, SM, palmitic acid, stearic acid, palmitoyl-CoA, Red Taq polymerase, defatted bovine serum albumin, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, leupeptin, antipain, and aprotinin were from Sigma. Stearoyl-CoA was from Laroden Lipid Biochemicals (Malmö, Sweden).d-erythro-Sphinganine,d-erythro-sphingosine,d-erythro-sphinganine 1-phosphate,d-erythro-sphingosine 1-phosphate,d-erythro-stearoyl-sphingosine, a neutral GSL standard mixture, a mono-sialo and di-sialo GSL standard mixture, and (1S,2R)-d-erythro-2-(N-myristoylamino)-1-phenyl-1-propanol were from Matreya (Pleasant Gap, PA). Reverse phase RP-18 columns were from Supelco (Bellefonte, PA). pcDNA 3.0 was from Invitrogen. A pGEMT cloning kit was from Promega Corp. (Madison, WI). Vent polymerase was from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA). LipofectAMINE was from Invitrogen. Restriction enzymes and DNA-modifying enzymes were either from MBI Fermentas (Vilnius, Lithuania) or from New England Biolabs. A one-step reverse transcriptase-PCR kit was from Qiagen GmbH (Hilden, Germany). A rat anti-HA monoclonal antibody (clone 3F10) was from Roche Molecular Biochemicals; a rabbit anti-protein-disulfide isomerase (PDI) antibody was from Stressgen (Victoria, Canada), and MitoTracker® Deep Red was from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). Silica Gel 60 thin layer chromatography (TLC) plates were from Merck. All solvents were of analytical grade and were purchased from Biolab (Jerusalem, Israel). The coding sequences of the human and mousegdf1 genes (GenBankTM accession numbers M62302and M62301) were subject to a Blast search against human and mouse expression sequence tag data bases. Two cDNA clones (GenBankTM accession numbers AU080088 (MNCb-5211) andAU080131 (MNCb-5265)) from mouse brain showed the highest sequence identity with the cDNA sequence of uog1 and were obtained from the National Institute of Infectious Diseases, Japanese Collection of Research Bioresources Gene Bank, Japan. Restriction digestion analysis of both MNCb-5211 and MNCb-5265 demonstrated that the constructs had two distinct open reading frames coding for uog1 and gdf1. The uog1fragment (1.3 kilobases) was released by restriction digestion usingEcoRI and AvrII sites, sub-cloned into a pcDNA 3.0 vector at EcoRI and XbaI sites, and subjected to nucleotide sequencing. Both MNCb-5211 and MNCb-5265 had identical nucleotide sequences, and the derived amino acid sequence from pcDNA-UOG1(5211) and pcDNA-UOG1(5265) demonstrated that there was one amino acid change, from serine to arginine, at position 334 compared with the derived amino acid sequence from mouse UOG1 (31Lee S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 4250-4254Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar); because the amino acid sequence was not conserved at this position between human and mouse UOG1, the coding sequence of MNCb-derived clones was not modified. Subsequently, the pcDNA-UOG1(5211) clone derived from MNCb-5211 was used for overexpression studies. Sequence-specific primers with unique restriction sites were designed for the 5′ and 3′ ends of uog1 cDNA, and theuog1 cDNA was amplified by PCR to obtain the 1.08-kb PCR product. The PCR product was sub-cloned into a pGEMT vector, and the positive clones were identified, according to instructions provided in the technical manual for the pGEMT easy vector system. The cDNA insert was also sub-cloned into tagged vectors to create vectors carrying hemagglutinin epitope (HA) tags at the N and C termini of UOG1. The coding sequences were confirmed by nucleotide sequencing. COS-7 cells, grown on glass coverslips, and human embryonic kidney 293T cells (HEK-293T), grown in Nunc tissue culture dishes, were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mml-glutamine, 100 IU/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. COS-7 cells were transfected using LipofectAMINE according to the manufacturer's instructions, and HEK-293T cells were transfected by the calcium phosphate method (32). Eighteen hours after transfection, COS-7 cells were incubated with MitoTracker® Deep Red (25 nm) for 15 min and chased for 3 min in fresh medium. The cells were then fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline (20 min, 37 °C), and subsequently permeabilized with 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100 in phosphate-buffered saline, 1% bovine serum albumin for 30 min. Primary antibodies (rabbit anti-PDI, dilution of 1:200; rat anti-HA, 1:500) were applied for 2 h at room temperature. A rhodamine-labeled goat anti-mouse secondary antibody (which cross-reacts with the rat anti-HA primary antibody) was diluted 1:200, and a fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody was diluted 1:500. After a 1-h incubation, slides were mounted in Fluoromount G and viewed by confocal laser scanning microscopy using an Olympus Fluoview FV500 imaging system. Fluorescein isothiocyanate, rhodamine fluorescence, and MitoTracker® Deep Red were viewed using an argon and two helium-neon laser with excitation wavelengths of 488, 543, and 633 nm, respectively. Images were acquired in sequential mode and analyzed using Fluoview 3 imaging software. 24 h after transfection, HEK-293T cells were incubated with or without 20 μm FB1. Subsequently, cells were metabolically labeled either with [4,5-3H]sphinganine or withl-3-[3H]serine and [14C]methylcholine. 9 μCi of [4,5-3H]sphinganine, synthesized by reduction ofd-erythro-sphingosine with NaB[3]H4 (11 Ci/mmol) (16Hirschberg K. Rodger J. Futerman A.H. Biochem. J. 1993; 290: 751-757Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar), was added to the culture medium 45 h after transfection. Three hours later, cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and removed from the dishes by scraping with a rubber policeman. After homogenization by sonication, protein concentration was determined (33Bradford M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (214435) Google Scholar), and lipids were extracted (34Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 37: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (42382) Google Scholar) and dried under N2. Lipids were subjected to alkaline hydrolysis in chloroform, 0.6 n NaOH in methanol (1:1) (37 °C, 2 h) to degrade glycerolipids (35Bodennec J. Koul O. Aguado I. Brichon G. Zwingelstein G. Portoukalian J. J. Lipid Res. 2000; 41: 1524-1531Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Samples were subsequently washed three times with water to remove the NaOH, and the [4/5-3H]sphingolipids 2[4,5-3H]Sphinganine is metabolized to [4,5-3H]dihydroceramide and subsequently to [3H]ceramide, which cannot be differentiated by the TLC solvent used in this experiment. [3H]Ceramide consists of a mixture of [4-3H]ceramide and [5-3H]ceramide (16Hirschberg K. Rodger J. Futerman A.H. Biochem.

The resulting lipid is therefore referred to as [4/5-3H](dihydro)ceramide. obtained from the chloroform phase were separated by TLC using chloroform, methanol, 9.8 mm CaCl2 (60:35:8, v/v) as the developing solvent. Cells were incubated withl-3-[3H]serine (30 μCi per dish) and [14C]methylcholine (3 μCi per dish) for 24 h. Lipids were then extracted (36Folch J. Lees M. Stanley G.H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1957; 226: 497-509Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and dissolved in benzene/methanol (1:1, v/v). 3H- and 14C-labeled phospholipids were resolved by two-dimensional TLC using tetrahydrofurane/acetone/methanol/water (50:20:40:6, v/v) as the first developing solvent, and chloroform/acetone/methanol/acetic acid/water (50:20:10:15:5, v/v) as the second developing solvent (35Bodennec J. Koul O. Aguado I. Brichon G. Zwingelstein G. Portoukalian J. J. Lipid Res. 2000; 41: 1524-1531Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Phospholipids were visualized using iodine and recovered from TLC plates by scraping the silica directly into scintillation vials. One ml of methanol and 5 ml of Optima Gold scintillation fluid (Packard Instrument Co.) were added to each vial for scintillation counting, and radioactivity was determined in a Packard 2100 beta radiospectrometer equipped with the Transformed Spectral Index of the External Standard/Automatic Efficiency Control (tSIE/AEC) program for quench correction and counting of double radiolabeled samples. Another aliquot of the lipid extract was used for analysis of [3H]sphingolipids. After alkaline hydrolysis (see above), the lipids were obtained from the chloroform phase, and after drying were reconstituted in 1:1 benzene/methanol (1:1, v/v). [3H]Sphingolipids were separated by TLC using the following developing solvents. (i) [3H](Dihydro)ceramide was separated using chloroform:methanol (50:3.5, v/v). (ii) [3H]GlcCer and [3H]galactosylceramide were separated on a sodium borate-coated TLC plate using chloroform/methanol/water (24:7:1, v/v). (iii) Neutral [3H]GSLs were separated on two-dimensional TLC using tetrahydrofurane/acetone/methanol/water (50:20:40:6, v/v) and chloroform/acetone/methanol/acetic acid/water (50:20:10:15:5, v/v). For analysis of acidic [3H]GSLs, the aqueous phase of the lipid extract (36Folch J. Lees M. Stanley G.H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1957; 226: 497-509Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was loaded onto Supelco RP-18 disposable cartridges (37Williams M.A. McCluer R.H. J. Neurochem. 1980; 35: 266-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar) and washed with water. Lipids were eluted using chloroform/methanol (1:1, v/v), dried under N2, mixed with authentic ganglioside standards, and separated by TLC using chloroform/methanol/9.8 mm CaCl2 (60:35:8, v/v). HEK-293T cells were homogenized in 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 25 mm KCl, 250 mm sucrose and 2 mm MgCl2, containing protease inhibitors (1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml antipain, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, and 100 kIU/ml aprotinin). Homogenates or microsomal fractions (16Hirschberg K. Rodger J. Futerman A.H. Biochem. J. 1993; 290: 751-757Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar, 38Venkataraman K. Futerman A.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1530: 219-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) (both 200 μg of protein) were incubated with 1.48 μCi of [4,5-3H]sphinganine, 15 μm sphinganine, 20 μm defatted bovine serum albumin (16Hirschberg K.

The reaction was initiated by addition of either 10 μm free fatty acid (palmitate or stearate) or 50 μm palmitoyl-CoA or stearoyl-CoA. Lipids were extracted (34Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Biochem.

HEK-293T cells were grown in 60-mm plastic culture dishes and transfected by the calcium phosphate method. After 24 h, cells were incubated with or without 20 μm FB1 for a further 24 h. Cells were harvested by trypsinization and collected by centrifugation. The cell pellet was washed once with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and lyophilized. The cell pellets were extracted and analyzed for sphingolipids using essentially the conditions described (39Sullards M.C. Methods Enzymol. 2001; 312: 32-45Crossref Google Scholar, 40Sullards, M. C., and Merrill, A. H., Jr. (2001)Science's STKE,//stke.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/OC_sigtrans;2001/67/pl1;2001, PL1.Google Scholar), which utilize normal phase high pressure liquid chromatography to separate the sphingolipid classes followed by electrospray tandem mass spectrometry (ESI-MS/MS) on a PE-Sciex API 3000 triple quadrupole mass spectrometer equipped with a turbo ionspray source. Dry N2was used as the nebulizing gas at a flow rate of 6 liters/min. The ionspray needle was held at 5500 V, and the orifice and ring voltages were kept low (40 and 220 V, respectively) to prevent collisional decomposition of molecular ions prior to entry into the first quadrupole, and the orifice temperature was set to 500 °C. N2 was used to collisionally induce dissociations in Q2, which was offset from Q1 by 40–50 V. Q3 was then set to pass molecularly distinctive product ions (N ions) of m/z264.2. Multiple reaction monitoring scans were acquired by setting Q1 and Q3 to pass the precursor and product ions of the most abundant sphingolipid molecular species. For example, for the ceramides, these transitions occur at m/z 538.7/264.4, 566.5/264.4, 622.7/264.4, 648.7/264.4, 650.7/264.4, which corresponds to ceramides with a d18:1 sphingoid base (sphingosine) and C16:0, C18:0, C22:0, C24:1, and C24:0 fatty acids, respectively. The dwell time was 25 ms for each transition. Quantitation was achieved by spiking the samples prior to extraction with the C12 fatty acid homologs of ceramide and SM along with the C8 fatty acid homolog of GlcCer. uog1 was sub-cloned into a pcDNA vector or into a pcDNA-HA vector to give constructs expressing UOG1 with an HA tag at the N (HA-UOG1) or C terminus (UOG1-HA). When the HA tag was at the N terminus of UOG-1, UOG1 was localized in reticular-like structures that were confirmed to correspond to the ER by almost complete co-localization with the ER marker, PDI, in both HEK-293T cells (not shown) and in COS cells (Fig.1); due to their size and morphology, much better resolution of intracellular organelles was obtained with COS cells. In contrast, when the tag was at the C terminus, the Golgi apparatus was strongly labeled and there was less co-localization with PDI. Because UOG1 has a C-terminal K(X)KXX motif (41Nilsson T. Jackson M. Peterson P. Cell. 1989; 58: 707-718Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar), this suggests that the presence of a tag at the C terminus blocks the recycling and retrieval of UOG1 from the Golgi apparatus to the ER. Neither HA-UOG1 nor UOG1-HA showed any co-localization with the mitochondria-specific dye MitoTracker® (Fig. 1) or with an anti-cytochrome c oxidase IV antibody (not shown). Similar results were obtained with green fluorescent protein-tagged UOG1 constructs. To determine whether UOG1 is involved in regulating (dihydro)ceramide synthesis in mammalian cells, uog1-transfected HEK-293T cells were metabolically labeled with [4,5-3H]sphinganine (15Meivar-Levy I. Futerman A.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 4607-4612Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 42Hirschberg K. Zisling R. van Echten-Deckert G. Futerman A.H. J. Biol.

Wang E. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 3764-3769Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). There was a 2.8-fold increase in [4/5-3H](dihydro)ceramide synthesis from [4,5-3H]sphinganine (Fig.2 A) and a small increase inl-3-[3H]serine incorporation into [3H]ceramide (Fig. 2 B) inuog1-transfected cells compared with mock-transfected cells. As expected, FB1 inhibited (dihydro)ceramide synthesis in mock-transfected cells using both labeling protocols. However, FB1 only inhibited [4/5-3H](dihydro)ceramide synthesis from [4,5-3H]sphinganine by ∼35% inuog1-transfected cells (Fig. 2 A) and, surprisingly, increased levels of [3H]ceramide synthesis from [3H]serine (Fig. 2 B). Thus, by using both [4,5-3H]sphinganine andl-3-[3H]serine, UOG1 overexpression elevates levels of (dihydro)ceramide synthesis and confers FB1resistance. 3The reason for the difference in the extent of FB1 resistance or of FB1-induced elevation of (dihydro)ceramide synthesis using the two different metabolic labeling protocols (i.e. [4,5-3H]sphinganine and l-3-[3H]serine) is not known but may be due to the different times of labeling (3 versus 24 h), the different amounts of label added, or the different sites of incorporation of l-3-[3H]serine and [4,5-3H]sphinganine into the sphingolipid metabolic pathway. The fate of the (dihydro)ceramide synthesized inuog1-transfected HEK-293T cells was determined by metabolic labeling with l-3-[3H]serine (TableI). In uog1-transfected cells a significant increase in the synthesis of the neutral GSLs, GlcCer, ceramide dihexosides, ceramide trihexosides, and globosides was observed compared with mock-transfected cells (Table I), but there was no elevation of ganglioside synthesis. In FB1-treateduog1-transfected cells, neutral GSL synthesis was elevated to an even greater extent, with ceramide trihexoside and globoside synthesis elevated 10–11-fold; similar to uog1-transfected cells that were"

A physiologically relevant interaction between decorin and EGFR was confirmed in the yeast two-hybrid system and further validated by experiments using EGF/EGFR interaction and transient cell transfection assays. Using a panel of deletion mutants, decorin binding was mapped to a narrow region of the EGFR within its ligand-binding L2 domain. Moreover, the central leucine-rich repeat 6 of decorin was required for interaction with the EGFR. Site-directed mutagenesis of the EGFR L2 domain showed that a cluster of residues, His394-Ile402, was essential for both decorin and EGF binding. In contrast, K465, previously shown to be cross-linked to epidermal growth factor (EGF), was required for EGF but not for decorin binding.

We have previously shown that decorin expression is enhanced around invasive carcinomas (22Adany R. Heimer R. Caterson B. Sorrell J.M. Iozzo R.V. J. Biol.

This working hypothesis is corroborated by the established effects of decorin on growth factor-mediated tumor progression (23Yamaguchi Y. Ruoslahti E.

These earlier reports have been supported by the recent observation that decorin gene expression is differentially down-regulated in hepatocellular (27Miyasaka Y. Enomoto N. Nagayama K. Izumi N.

However, following a transient stimulation of the EGFR kinase, decorin causes a sustained down-regulation of the EGFR (33Csordás G. Santra M. Reed C.C. Eichstetter I. McQuillan D.J. Gross D.

Additional decorin-mediated effects are observed in normal cells such as macrophages (35Xaus J. Comalada M. Cardó M. Valledor A.F. Celada A. Blood. 2001; 98: 2124-2133Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar), endothelial (36Schönherr E. Levkau B. Schaefer L. Kresse H. Walsh K. J. Biol.

J. 2002; 362: 643-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Interestingly, EGF suppresses decorin expression in normal fibroblasts, suggesting a negative feedback loop between growth-promoting and growth-suppressing factors (38Laine P. Reunanen N. Ravanti L. Foschi M. Santra M. Iozzo R.V. Kahari V. Biochem. J. 2000; 349: 19-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). In this study we utilized an expression cloning strategy and discovered two transmembrane polypeptides that bound a soluble decorin/AP chimera. The two proteins encompassed either the full-length EGFR or a truncated version lacking the intracellular domain. The specific binding of decorin to the EGFR (K D ∼27 nm) could be demonstrated in six different cell lines following transient transfection with the EGFR ectodomain. Moreover, we demonstrated a physiologically relevant interaction between decorin and EGFR using the yeast two-hybrid system, also confirmed by EGF/EGFR experiments. Using a panel of deletion mutants, decorin binding was mapped to a narrow region of the EGFR ectodomain within the ligand-binding L2 domain. Deletion mutants of decorin further revealed that the central leucine-rich repeat 6 (LRR6) of decorin was required for proper interaction with the EGFR. Site-directed mutagenesis of the EGFR L2 domain showed that a cluster of residues, His394-Ile402, was essential for both decorin and EGF binding; however, there was differential binding following multiple amino acid substitutions. These in vivo data confirm the specific binding of decorin to the EGFR and show that the decorin protein core binds to a discrete region of the EGFR, partially overlapping with but distinct from the EGF-binding epitope. Our results could potentially lead to the generation of protein mimetics that could antagonize EGFR activity in a variety of tumors in which EGFR is overexpressed. The cDNA encoding the heat-stable placental AP was amplified from the APtag vector (39Flanagan J.G. Leder P. Cell. 1990; 63: 185-194Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (630) Google Scholar) by using two oligonucleotide primers with two different restriction sites, KpnI andEcoRI, and ligated into the expression vector pcDNA3 (Invitrogen). Similarly, a PCR-generated full-length human decorin cDNA was digested with EcoRI and XbaI and ligated at the 5′ end of the AP/pcDNA3. Correct ligation and open reading frames were determined by automatic sequencing of the entire construct. Human squamous carcinoma A431 cells were stably transfected with this vector. The clones were selected on the basis of Northern and Western blot analyses as described before (34Santra M. Eichstetter I. Iozzo R.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 35153-35161Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Two independent clones, 9 and 10, with high expression of decorin/AP chimeric protein were expanded, and conditioned media were collected for interaction study. The Great EscAPe™ SEAP system (CLONTECH) was used for AP assays. Briefly, conditioned media from clone 10 from untransfected cells (negative control) and from cells stably transfected with and secreting an AP construct (positive control) were collected. Aliquots were incubated at 65 °C for 30 min to inactivate endogenous phosphatases, cooled on ice, and then mixed with CSPD substrate/chemiluminescent enhancer for 10 min followed by exposure to x-ray film for 30 s. The standard AP curve was generated with conditioned media from a stable AP construct. Plates were treated as discussed before and were quantified on a Spectramax plate reader (Molecular Devices). Multiple runs of the standard were grouped for generation of the curve. The cDNA was made from mRNA extracted from A-431 cells, sequentially digested with EcoRI and SalI, and ligated in the proper orientation into the pcDNA3 expression vector according to manufacturer's instructions (Stratagene). High efficiency ultra-competent Epicurean cells (Stratagene) were transformed with 1 μl of this ligated material. The bacteria were divided into ∼100 pools. Plasmid DNA was prepared from each pool and transiently transfected into subconfluent COS-1 cells, essentially as described before (39Flanagan J.G. Leder P. Cell. 1990; 63: 185-194Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (630) Google Scholar). In initial screenings, we found that no decorin/AP- or AP-containing media bound to the surface of COS-1 cells, in agreement with previous results (40He Z. Tessier-Lavigne M. Cell. 1997; 90: 739-751Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (965) Google Scholar, 41Kolodkin A.L. Levengood D.V. Rowe E.G. Tai Y.-T. Giger R.J. Ginty D.D. Cell. 1997; 90: 753-762Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (997) Google Scholar). After 2 days, the transfected COS-1 cells were incubated for 90 min with media from the decorin/AP-secreting cells, which were concentrated 5-fold using a Centricon apparatus (50-kDa cutoff). The cells were washed seven times with phosphate-buffered saline, fixed for 30 s in 60% acetone, 3% formaldehyde, 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), and washed twice for 5 min each in 150 mm NaCl, 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.5). The plates were then floated on a 65 °C water bath for 30 min to inactivate endogenous cellular phosphatases. After rinsing with 100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 9.5), 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, the cells were stained for 72 h in the same buffer containing 10 mml-homoarginine, 0.17 mg/ml 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-phosphate (BCIP) and 0.33 mg/ml nitro blue tetrazolium (NBT) as color substrate (Promega). Several positive clones were identified as purple-stained cells representing decorin interacting proteins. In initial screening, AP-containing media did not react with COS-1 cells. Two clones (17-10 and 17-14) were subjected to two successive rounds of screening by diluting the original positive clones 1:48. Finally, single cDNA pools from tertiary screening were diluted into 12 pools for the last screening. When all the clones were positive, plasmids were subjected to automatic sequencing. To determine whether the interaction observed in the yeast could also be obtained in mammalian cells, we subcloned the EGFR into the eukaryotic expression vector pcDNA3. Various cell lines were transiently transfected with 2 μg of EGFR/pcDNA3 using the polyamine reagent TransIT® (Mirus Corp.). After 48 h, the cells were incubated with decorin/AP-containing media, washed several times, and processed for histochemical detection of AP. For binding studies, COS-1 cells were transfected in the same manner and incubated at 4 °C for 2 h with 125I-labeled decorin protein core, a human recombinant protein core containingO-linked oligosaccharides but lacking the glycosaminoglycan side chain (42Mann D.M. Yamaguchi Y. Bourdon M.A. Ruoslahti E. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 5317-5323Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The decorin core was labeled to high specific activity (∼1018 cpm/mol) using Iodogen essentially as described before (34Santra M. Eichstetter I. Iozzo R.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 35153-35161Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Estimates of receptor affinity and number of binding sites were achieved using the Wizard program of the Sigma Plot 2001 package. The ectodomain of the EGFR was generated using primers containing SalI and BglII restriction sites and was ligated into pGAD424 (CLONTECH) vector as prey in the same reading frame as the GAL4 activating domain. In a similar way, decorin cDNA was ligated in pGBT9 (Matchmaker 2, CLONTECH) vector as bait. The different deletion constructs of the ectodomain of EGFR in pGAD424 vector were made by PCR using the same restriction sites as described above. As a positive control, we synthesized human EGF by using two 159-bp oligonucleotides of sense and antisense EGF containing two additional restriction sites for EcoRI at the 5′ end and SalI1 at the 3′ end. Yeast reporter strain SFY526 was grown on YPD plates. The growth media were inoculated with a single colony 2–3 mm in diameter and incubated at 30 °C with shaking (250 rpm) for 16–18 h. The cells were grown at 1:30 dilution for 3 h to reach ∼0.2 A, pelleted by centrifugation (1000 × g for 5 min twice), and re-suspended in sterile Tris EDTA/LiAc solution. These competent cells were transformed with 1 μg of EGFR-pGAD424 and decorin-pGBT9 vector constructs with PEG/LiAc solution and plated on S.D. plates lacking Leu and His, or on S.D. plates lacking Leu, His, and Trp. The transformants were grown for 2–4 days at 30 °C. The colonies were lifted with 3MM paper and completely submerged in liquid nitrogen for 10 s. The filters were allowed to thaw at room temperature and placed on another paper pre-soaked in Z buffer/X-α-gal solution. The β-galactosidase-expressing colonies turned blue in 1–2 h. Various deletion mutants of the EGFR or decorin were generated by PCR, including suitable 5′ restriction endonuclease sites to allow unidirectional cloning into the various vectors. Site-directed mutagenesis was performed by PCR using 40–50 nucleotide oligomers containing the suitable restriction site at their 5′ ends and internal substitutions to allow one or multiple amino acid mutations. All of the constructs were fully sequenced before transfection. Additional experimental details are provided in the legends to the figures and the text. The first step for performing expression cloning was to generate a soluble decorin proteoglycan with an easily detectable marker. To this end, we fused the coding region of human decorin to that of the heat-stable human placental AP, a readily detectable histochemical reporter (39Flanagan J.G. Leder P. Cell. 1990; 63: 185-194Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (630) Google Scholar), and expressed the resulting chimeric proteoglycan in A431 squamous carcinoma cells using pcDNA3 vector. Among more than 40 clones resistant to G418, we selected two (clones 9 and 10), which expressed a message that hybridized with decorin cDNA (Fig. 1 A, top panel). As negative controls, we also generated stable transfectant clones expressing AP alone. Of interest, the expression of decorin/AP caused a concurrent induction of p21 (Fig. 1 A,middle panel), a potent cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor (43El-Deiry W.S. Tokino T. Velculescu V.E. Levy D.B. Parsons R. Trent J.M. Lin D. Mercer W.E. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Cell. 1993; 75: 817-825Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (7903) Google Scholar), which has been shown to be a downstream target of decorin (29Moscatello D.K. Santra M. Mann D.M. McQuillan D.J. Wong A.J. Iozzo R.V. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 406-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar, 32De Luca A. Santra M. Baldi A. Giordano A. Iozzo R.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18961-18965Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). Both clones expressed a single broad band centering at ∼150 kDa, consistent with the combined sizes of decorin (∼100 kDa) and AP (∼50 kDa). The chimeric proteoglycans were sensitive to chondroitinase ABC digestion (Fig. 1 B), further establishing their proteoglycan nature. Clone 10 was assessed for AP activity using either a standard colorimetric reaction or chemiluminescence (Fig. 1 C) and found to contain high levels of expression as compared with standard AP. Quantitative analysis, using a standard curve based on recombinant AP activity (Fig.1 D), revealed that clone 10 produced ∼10 μg/ml of decorin/AP chimeric proteoglycan/107 cells/24 h. Collectively, these results indicate that decorin/AP is properly folded because of the following: (a) it has full biological activity since it is capable of inducing p21 and causing growth retardation of the two clones (not shown), in agreement with our previous data (32De Luca A. Santra M. Baldi A. Giordano A. Iozzo R.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18961-18965Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar); (b) it is a fully glycosylated proteoglycan as shown by its migration on SDS-PAGE and its sensitivity to chondroitinase ABC (not shown); and (c) it shows strong AP activity, utilizing either a classical colorimetric reaction or chemiluminescence. To identify decorin-interacting proteins we generated a cDNA library from mRNA of A431 squamous carcinoma cells using random priming and oligo-deoxynucleotidyltransferase. The resulting cDNAs were subcloned into the expression vector pcDNA3 and divided into 100 pools, each containing ∼5,000 individual cDNAs. Each pool was transiently transfected into green monkey COS-1 cells and screened for cells that bound to soluble decorin/AP (39Flanagan J.G. Leder P. Cell. 1990; 63: 185-194Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (630) Google Scholar). The decorin/AP-containing media were concentrated 5-fold by ultrafiltration (M r = 50 kDa cutoff), thereby further purifying the medium and removing degradation products and smaller proteins that could potentially interfere with the assay. Using this approach, we isolated two cDNA pools that, when transfected, induced the surface binding of decorin/AP chimeric proteoglycan (Fig.2 A). Each pool was subjected to two additional screenings by ∼50-fold dilutions. After three rounds of screening, we identified and characterized two cDNAs that evoked a robust in situ binding when transiently expressed by COS-1 cells. Clone 17-10 contained an insert of ∼6 kb (Fig.2 B), whereas clone 17-14 contained an insert of ∼2.4 kb (Fig. 2 C). Interestingly, the nucleotide sequence of the entire 17-10 cDNA revealed a single open reading frame that matched identically with the full-length EGFR (GenBank accession number NM_005228). Clone 17-14 encoded a C-terminal truncated form of the EGFR encompassing the ectodomain and the transmembrane region, but lacking the intracellular domain (Fig. 2 D). Collectively, these findings provide independent confirmation that decorin is a biological ligand for the EGFR. To determine whether EGFR was indeed interacting with decorin/AP chimeric proteoglycan, we transiently transfected five different human cell lines of diverse histogenetic origin with the EGFR ectodomain (clone 17-14) expression vector. In all cases there was a pronounced binding of decorin/AP (Fig.3 A). Note that the histochemical detection of AP was done for only 1 h, because prolonged incubation revealed the endogenous EGFR that is highly expressed in A431 and moderately expressed in the other tumor cell lines. Thus, EGFR is a transmembrane protein that selectively interacts with decorin. Because the EGFR ectodomain was capable of interacting with soluble decorin/AP chimera, we conclude that the intracellular domain of the EGFR is not essential for proper decorin binding. Next, to establish the affinity of decorin for EGFR and to exclude the possibility that the interaction may be mediated by the AP moiety, we utilized a radio-ligand binding assay. To this end, COS-1 cells, which express very low levels of EGFR, 2M. Santra, C. C. Reed, and R. V. Iozzo, unpublished observation. were transiently transfected with either EGFR ectodomain-containing pcDNA3 or empty vector and then incubated at 4 °C with increasing concentrations of125I-labeled decorin protein core (42Mann D.M. Yamaguchi Y. Bourdon M.A. Ruoslahti E. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 5317-5323Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The binding was saturable in the range of 25–50 nm, in contrast to the mock-transfected cells that showed much lower levels of binding and did not display saturation (Fig. 3 B, top panel). The binding data yielded a straight line in a Scatchard plot (Fig.3 B, lower panel), with a K D = 27.5 ± 4 nm and a number of ligand molecules of ∼1.8 × 105 per cell. These values are comparable to those obtained with mammary carcinoma cells (K D = 71 ± 7 nm) (34Santra M. Eichstetter I. Iozzo R.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 35153-35161Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar) and further indicate that the glycosaminoglycan chains are not directly involved in this interaction since we utilized a radio-labeled protein core. To further prove a physical interaction between the decorin protein core and the EGFR, we utilized the yeast two-hybrid system. We first cloned the EGFR ectodomain into the pGAD vector containing the activating domain (prey), whereas the full-length human decorin protein core was cloned into the pGB vector containing the binding domain (bait). As positive and negative controls, we utilized either the pGB-53 (harboring the p53 gene) or the pGB-Lam5′ (harboring the lamin 5 gene) combined with pGAD-T (containing the SV40 T antigen), respectively. In addition, as a positive control for EGFR we synthesized a cDNA encompassing the human EGF sequence known to have high affinity for the EGFR (44Savage Jr., C.R. Hash J.H. Cohen S. J. Biol. Chem. 1973; 248: 7669-7672Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and cloned it into the pGB vector. Before proceeding with the actual screening, the bait plasmid harboring the EGFR ectodomain was tested alone and found not to induce yeast growth in triple minus (Trp−, His−, Leu−) media. In addition, all the constructs were assayed for growth in double minus (Trp−, Leu−) media as a control for transfection efficiency (45Mongiat M. Otto J. Oldershaw R. Ferrer F. Sato J.D. Iozzo R.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 10263-10271Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). In the co-transformant reactions we found a robust growth in triple minus media for both constructs (Fig.3 C). Thus, the decorin protein core interacts with the EGFR ectodomain in vivo to an extent comparable to the EGF/EGFR interaction. These data also represent the first demonstration of a specific EGF/EGFR interaction using the yeast two-hybrid system. Moreover, these findings strengthen the notion that it is a real protein/protein interaction unaffected by, and independent of, the presence of glycosaminoglycan side chains or AP. Next, we sought to establish the precise location of the decorin-binding site within the ectodomain of the EGFR by generating 10 deletion mutants of"

PPAR-γ is also expressed in vessel wall tissue, including endothelial cells (ECs) (1Marx N. Bourcier T. Sukhova G.K. Libby P. Plutzky J. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1999; 19: 546-551Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar). However, the role of PPAR-γ activation in ECs remains unclear. Previous studies have shown that PPAR-γ agonists such as 15-deoxy-Δ12,14-prostaglandin J2 (15d-PGJ2) and the thiazolidinedione (TZD) class of insulin-sensitizing drugs can modulate the expression of many pro-inflammatory cytokines (2Ricote M., Li, A.C. Willson T.M. Kelly C.J. Glass C.K. Nature. 1998; 391: 79-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (3258) Google Scholar), chemokines (3Marx N. Mach F. Sauty A. Leung J.H. Sarafi M.N. Ransohoff R.M. Libby P.

Circulation. 2000; 101: 235-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (500) Google Scholar) in macrophages and many other cell types including ECs. However, the observed anti-inflammatory effects often vary according to the agonists used and are not always consistent with their capacity for receptor binding (5Delerive P. Fruchart J.C. Staels B. J. Endocrinol. 2001; 169: 453-459Crossref PubMed Scopus (661) Google Scholar). Furthermore, recent studies indicate that the receptor-independent effects exist both for 15d-PG-J2 and TZDs (6Chawla A. Barak Y. Nagy L. Liao D. Tontonoz P. Evans R.M. Nat. Med. 2001; 7: 48-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (965) Google Scholar, 7Straus D.S. Pascual G., Li, M. Welch J.S. Ricote M. Hsiang C.H.

Therefore, whether constitutive activation of the PPAR-γ per se, regardless of pleiotropic ligand-specific effects, has an anti-inflammatory effect remains to be investigated. The aim of this study was to examine whether a constitutively active PPAR-γ can modulate the endothelial expression of pro-inflammatory phenotype such as the induction of adhesion molecules and recruitment of leukocytes. The constitutively active mutant of PPAR-γ1 (VP-PPAR-γ) was constructed by fusing the herpes virus VP16 activation domain to wild-type PPAR-γ1, and delivered into human umbilical cord vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) with use of a tetracycline-controlled adenoviral system. The overexpression of VP-PPAR-γ resulted in the ligand-independent activation of PPAR-γ and specific induction of the PPAR-γ target genes. However, the induced expression of intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), vascular adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1), and E-selectin was significantly suppressed in the VP-PPAR-γ−transduced ECs. Consequently, endothelial recruitment of monocytes was markedly attenuated by constitutive activation of the PPAR-γ. Results from electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA) and reporter transfection assays demonstrated that VP-PPAR-γ in ECs resulted in a simultaneous decrease in AP-1 and NF-κB activity. These results demonstrate that activation of endothelial PPAR-γ has a potent anti-inflammatory role. HUVECs were harvested by collagenase treatment of umbilical cord veins and cultured on plates coated with collagen. Cells were maintained in M199 supplemented with 20% fetal bovine serum, 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 1 ng/ml of recombinant human fibroblast growth factor, and 90 μg/ml of heparin and antibiotics. In all the experiments, cells within three passages were used. THP-1, a human monocyte cell line (ATCC), was grown in RPMI 1640 containing 10% fetal bovine serum. Recombinant human tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α was from Becton-Dickinson. Phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) and tetracycline were purchased from Sigma. VP-PPAR-γ contains the 78 amino acid herpes simplex virus (HSV) VP16 transactivation domain fused to the N terminus of mouse PPAR-γ1 (GenBankTM accession number U10374). To generate the adenoviruses expressing VP-PPAR-γ (Ad-VP-PPAR-γ), the cDNA fragment containing VP-PPAR-γ was subcloned into a shuttle plasmid pAdlox and recombined with an E1-and E3-deleted ψ 5 viral DNA in CRE8 cells (8Hardy S. Kitamura M. Harris-Stansil T. Dai Y. Phipps M.L. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 1842-1849Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The expression of the inserted gene was driven by a 7 × tet/minimal cytomegalovirus promoter that was further under the control of an artificial tetracycline-responsive transactivator (tTA). The adenoviruses expressing green fluorescence protein (Ad-GFP) and tTA were previously described (9Wang N. Verna L. Liao H. Ballard A. Zhu Y. Stemerman M.B. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2001; 21: 1414-1420Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The adenoviruses were plaque-purified, expanded, titrated in 293 cells, and purified by cesium chloride methods. For adenovirus-mediated gene transfer, confluent HUVECs were exposed to adenoviral vectors at a multiplicity-of-infection rate of ∼50–100 for 2 h (Ad-tTA was co-infected to induce the tetracycline controllable expression). After the viruses were washed off, infected cells were further incubated for the indicated time in the presence or absence of tetracycline. The PPRE-TK-Luc is a luciferase reporter containing the herpes virus thymidine kinase promoter (−105/+51) downstream of three copies of PPAR response elements from the acyl-CoA oxidase gene. The pCMX-VP16 is a plasmid encoding the VP16 transactivation domain. Plasmids for the yeast transcription factor Gal4 and 4 × UAS-TK-luc were described previously (9Wang N. Verna L. Liao H.

The ICAM-1 promoter reporter ICAM-1 (−445)-luc was constructed by subcloning a 445-bp 5′-flanking region of the human ICAM-1 gene (provided by Thomas Parks, Boehringer Ingelheim Pharmaceuticals, Ridgefield, CT) (10Ledebur H.C. Parks T.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 933-943Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (515) Google Scholar) into pGL3-basic luciferase reporter plasmid (Promega) (9Wang N. Verna L. Liao H. Ballard A. Zhu Y. Stemerman M.B. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2001; 21: 1414-1420Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Mutagenesis of the AP-1/NF-κB site in the human ICAM-1 promoter region was performed with the QuikChangeTM polymerase chain reaction-based method (Stratagene) as described previously (9Wang N. Verna L. Liao H. Ballard A. Zhu Y. Stemerman M.B. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2001; 21: 1414-1420Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Mutagenic primers were used to introduce mutations (lowercase letters) at the AP-1-like site (−321, in relation to the start codon) and the NF-κB-like site (−223) (underlined) in the ICAM-1 promoter region: AP-1m, 5′-GCGGTGTAGACCGTGgTgCcAGCTTAGCCTGGCCG-3′ and NF-κBm, 5′-CGATTGCTTTAGCTTGGAAAcattGGAGCTGAAGCGGCC-3′. Following transformation, amplification, selection, and screening, the mutagenic exchanges were confirmed by sequencing. Plasmids were introduced into HUVECs with use of a cationic lipid-based transfection reagent Targefect (Targeting System, San Diego, CA). At the indicated time posttransfection, cell lysates were harvested to measure luciferase activity. The β-galactosidase activity was also measured to normalize transfection efficiency. Total RNA was isolated using Trizol reagent (Invitrogen), fractionated on a formaldehyde-agarose gel, transferred to a nylon membrane, and hybridized to random-primed cDNA probes for human ICAM-1, VCAM-1, E-selectin, and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) genes. The cDNA probes for human CD36 were synthesized by reverse-transcriptase PCR as previously described (11Han J. Hajjar D.P. Tauras J.M. Feng J. Gotto A.M., Jr. Nicholson A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1241-1246Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Sequences of the primers were CD36 (forward): 5′-ATGGGCTGTGACCGGAACT (285–304); (reverse): 5′-ACAGACCAACTGTGGTAG (871–889). Cellular proteins were extracted from HUVECs as previously described (12Wang N. Verna L. Hardy S. Forsayeth J. Zhu Y. Stemerman M.B. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1999; 19: 2078-2084Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Protein concentration was measured with the BCA protein assay kit (Pierce). Protein samples were resolved on SDS-PAGE, transferred onto ImmobilonTM-P membrane (Millipore, Bedford, Massachusetts) and analyzed with use of a rabbit polyclonal antibody to PPAR-γ (H-100, Santa Cruz, California) and an horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (sheep anti-rabbit, 1:5000, Sigma) followed by ECL detection (AmershamBiosciences). The nuclear extracts were first mixed with 1 μg of poly (dI-dC) in DNA binding buffer and incubated at room temperature for 10 min.32P-labeled oligonucleotides were then added to the reaction and incubated for 20 min at room temperature. The oligonucleotides were end labeled with use of T4 polynucleotide kinase and [γ-32P]adenosine triphosphate (ICN). The sequences of oligonucleotides are as follows (sequences of the complementary strands are omitted): 1) PPRE (Aco oxidase), 5′-GGGGACCAGGACAAAGGTCACGTTCGGGAGCT-3′; 2) AP-1 (consensus), 5′-CGCTTGATGAGTCAGCCGGAA-3′; and 3) NF-κB (consensus), 5′-AGTTGAGGGGACTTTCCCAGGC-3′. Human monocytic cells, THP-1, were infected with Ad-GFP and Ad-tTA. Twenty-four hours post-infection, the THP-1 cells were washed and co-incubated for 30 min with control or activated HUVECs. Unbound leukocytes were removed by washing, the adhered cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, and the number of adhered cells was visualized by fluorescence microscopy as described previously (9Wang N. Verna L. Liao H. Ballard A. Zhu Y. Stemerman M.B. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2001; 21: 1414-1420Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). To quantify the THP-1 adhesion, the cells (THP-1 and HUVECs) were harvested, solubilized, and measured with use of a fluorescence concentration analyzer (Pandex, IDEXX) as previously described (13Smalley D.M. Lin J.H. Curtis M.L. Kobari Y. Stemerman M.B. Pritchard K.A., Jr. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1996; 16: 585-590Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Quantitative data are expressed as mean ± S.E. Statistical analysis was performed with use of the Student’s t test. Differences were considered significant when probability values were less than 0.05. To examine the role of PPAR-γ in EC phenotypic modulation, we constructed a constitutively active form of PPAR-γ by fusing a herpes virus VP16 transactivation domain to the wild-type PPAR-γ1 cDNA. A recombinant adenovirus expressing VP-PPAR-γ was made to ensure a ubiquitous yet controllable expression of VP-PPAR-γ in ECs (Fig. 1A). As shown by RNA hybridization and immunoblotting (Fig. 1B), overexpression of VP-PPAR-γ was achieved by infection of HUVECs with Ad-VP-PPAR-γ and Ad-tTA and switched off by the addition of tetracycline in the culture medium. Furthermore, the overexpression of VP-PPAR-γ specifically induced DNA binding to Aco-PPRE, which could be blocked by a specific cold competitor (Fig.2A). VP-PPAR-γ did not bind to the sequences for other transcription factors such as AP-1, NF-κB, AP-2, and GATA (data not shown). In addition, a transient reporter assay was performed to assess the functionality of VP-PPAR-γ to induce the PPRE-dependent gene expression. As shown in Fig. 2B, adenovirus-mediated expression of VP-PPAR-γ caused a more than 10-fold increase in the PPRE-driven luciferase expression in the absence of exogenous PPAR-γ ligands. It is thus demonstrated that adenovirus-mediated expression of VP-PPAR-γ can be used as a model for constitutive PPAR-γ activation in ECs.Figure 2VP-PPAR-γ binds to the PPRE and activates the PPRE-responsive gene in HUVECs.A, EMSA results showing overexpression of VP-PPAR-γ increased the binding to consensus PPRE oligonucleotides (6 μg of nuclear extracts per lane).

Cells in 6-well plates were transfected with the PPRE-luc plasmids. Expression plasmid for β-galactosidase was included to normalize the transfection efficiency. Luciferase activities were assessed and, after normalization against β-gal activity, expressed as the fold induction of the basal activity.

Northern blotting results (Fig.3) reveal that overexpression of the VP-PPAR-γ significantly suppressed the induction of these adhesion molecules by PMA and TNF-α, whereas expression of the housekeeping gene GAPDH was not affected. In contrast, the expression of CD36, an endogenous target gene of PPAR-γ, was clearly induced. Thus, constitutive activation of PPAR-γ selectively down-regulated the pro-inflammatory genes in ECs. The induction of adhesion molecules is essential for leukocyte trafficking to the vessel wall and for eliciting inflammatory reactions in various physiological and pathological processes. Therefore, we carried out the endothelial-leukocyte adhesion assay to investigate whether the constitutive activation of PPAR-γ functionally modulates such a process in vitro. The monocytic cells (THP-1) were infected to express a green fluorescence protein for use in visualization and quantification by fluorescence microscopy or fluorescence analyzer. As shown in Fig.4, massive EC-leukocyte adhesion was induced by prestimulating HUVECs with either TNF-α or PMA. However, constitutive activation of PPAR-γ in ECs significantly attenuated the recruitment of leukocytes provoked by either pro-inflammatory agonist. Thus, it is plausible that an increase in PPAR-γ activity is sufficient to down-regulate the expression of adhesion molecules and, as a result, to prevent the endothelium from converting into a pro-inflammatory state. To understand how the constitutive activation of PPAR-γ causes the transcriptional repression of the adhesion molecules, we examined the effect of VP-PPAR-γ on the activation of AP-1 and NF-κB, which are known to be the most important transcription factors governing endothelial activation. As seen in Fig.5A, the constitutive activation of PPAR-γ markedly inhibited both AP-1- and NF-κB-mediated gene expression in the transient reporter assays. However, it did not affect the yeast transcription factor Gal4-mediated gene expression. This trans-repressive effect was also demonstrated in results from EMSA. In the VP-PPAR-γ−expressing cells, the AP-1 and NF-κB binding activity clearly decreased (Fig. 5B). Further, ICAM-1 promoter assays were performed to address whether the simultaneous inhibition of AP-1 and NF-κB by the constitutively active PPAR-γ can account for the transcriptional suppression of the vascular adhesion molecules. As shown in Fig.6, the induced ICAM-1 promoter activity was significantly repressed by co-expression of the VP-PPAR-γ but not the VP16 activation alone. However, abolishing the AP-1 and NF-κB binding sites virtually eliminated the ICAM-1 promoter induction as well as the suppressive effect of the VP- PPAR-γ. Thus, it demonstrated that a simultaneous inhibition of AP-1 and NF-κB activity is sufficient to block the ICAM-1 induction and may contribute to the inhibitory effect of VP-PPAR-γ on the induction of the adhesion molecules and the ensuing endothelial-leukocyte interaction.Figure 6VP-PPAR-γ suppresses ICAM-1 induction via AP-1 and NF-κB pathway.

Mach F. Sauty A. Leung J.H. Sarafi M.N. Ransohoff R.M. Libby P. Plutzky J. Luster A.D. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 6503-6508Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar,4Pasceri V., Wu, H.D. Willerson J.T. Yeh E.T. Circulation. 2000; 101: 235-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (500) Google Scholar). Both endogenous and synthetic PPAR-γ ligands such as 15d-PG-J2 and TZDs were shown to inhibit the expression of pro-inflammatory genes in monocyte and other cell types. Moreover, these ligands have been demonstrated to be effective in animal models of many inflammatory disorders including atherosclerosis (14Li A.C. Brown K.K. Silvestre M.J. Willson T.M. Palinski W. Glass C.K. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 106: 523-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (772) Google Scholar), arthritis (15Kawahito Y. Kondo M. Tsubouchi Y. Hashiramoto A. Bishop-Bailey D. Inoue K. Kohno M. Yamada R. Hla T. Sano H. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 106: 189-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar) and inflammatory bowel disease (16Su C.G. Wen X. Bailey S.T. Jiang W. Rangwala S.M. Keilbaugh S.A. Flanigan A. Murthy S. Lazar M.A. Wu G.D. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 104: 383-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (725) Google Scholar). However, because the anti-inflammatory potency of the PPAR-γ ligands does not parallel their affinity to the receptor and these ligands often possess pleiotropic activities other than being PPAR-γ agonists, receptor-independent mechanisms have been suggested. For instance, deletion of the gene expressing PPAR-γ in stem cell-derived macrophages did not alter basal or stimulated cytokine production. Furthermore, high concentrations of PPAR-γ ligands can inhibit cytokine production in macrophages lacking PPAR-γ (6Chawla A. Barak Y. Nagy L. Liao D. Tontonoz P. Evans R.M. Nat. Med. 2001; 7: 48-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (965) Google Scholar). Thus, the question is whether PPAR-γ activation, excluding the various receptor-independent effects of a rapidly expanding pool of ligands, is by itself sufficient to revert a pro-inflammatory phenotype. In this study, using a tightly regulated adenoviral system to express the constitutively active PPAR-γ in HUVECs, we demonstrated a potent inhibitory effect of this receptor on the endothelial expression of pro-inflammatory adhesion molecules and the ensuing leukocyte recruitment. This observation provides novel evidence for a receptor-dependent role in modulating endothelial phenotypic activation, which suggests that modification of the PPAR-γ receptor may be a potential anti-inflammatory strategy. The EC expression of adhesion molecules and recruitment of leukocytes to the vessel wall are critical steps in the immune response and in inflammatory disorders (17Frenette P.S. Wagner D.D. N. Engl. J. Med. 1996; 335: 43-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). The expression of these adhesion molecules has been found to be regulated by various agonists for PPAR-γ, which is expressed in vessel tissues including the endothelium. However, with respect to a role for PPAR-γ ligands in the induction of endothelial adhesion molecules, data have been inconsistent. Pasceri et al. found that 15d-PG-J2 (20 μm) and troglitazone (100 μm) markedly attenuated the TNF-α-induced expression of VCAM-1 and ICAM-1 but not E-selectin and PECAM-1 in HUVECs (4Pasceri V., Wu, H.D. Willerson J.T. Yeh E.T. Circulation. 2000; 101: 235-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (500) Google Scholar). Jackson et al. found that, in aortic ECs, the PMA- or LPS-induced VCAM-1 was partially inhibited by the PPAR-γ activators 15d-PG-J2, ciglitazone and troglitazone, but unaffected by BRL 49653 (rosiglitazone) (18Jackson S.M. Parhami F., Xi, X.P. Berliner J.A. Hsueh W.A. Law R.E. Demer L.L. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1999; 19: 2094-2104Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). Chen et al. described troglitazone as enhancing both basal and oxidized LDL-induced ICAM-1 expression in ECV-304, an endothelial-like tumor cell line (19Chen N.G. Sarabia S.F. Malloy P.J. Zhao X.Y. Feldman D. Reaven G.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 263: 718-722Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). At the moment, there is no obvious explanation for these seemingly conflicting results. It is plausible that differences in cell types and stimuli may account for the observed discrepancies. In addition, the inconsistent results may also be attributed to the receptor-independent effects. However, because we have shown that constitutive activation of PPAR-γ in ECs sufficiently inhibited the expression of these adhesion molecules challenged by either PMA or TNF-α, it can be speculated that pharmacological activation of PPAR may exert an anti-inflammatory net effect if the receptor-independent nonspecific effects are minimized. As a transcription factor, the primary mechanism for PPAR-γ to regulate gene expression is through binding to the specific recognition site, the PPAR-responsive element (PPRE), in the promoter region of a target gene. Thus, as expected, the constitutively active PPAR-γ induced the gene expression of CD36, which has a consensus PPRE in its promoter and is considered to be a PPAR-γ-specific target gene (20Tontonoz P. Nagy L. Alvarez J.G. Thomazy V.A. Evans R.M. Cell. 1998; 93: 241-252Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1611) Google Scholar). Induction of the CD36 expression demonstrated both functionality and specificity of the adenovirally expressed VP-PPAR-γ. However, because the consensus PPRE motif was not identified in the 5′-flanking regions of the ICAM-1, VCAM-1, and E-selectin genes, the regulatory mechanisms for the down-regulation of these vascular adhesion molecules by VP-PPAR-γ may not be the same as that for the CD36 induction. We have found that the constitutive activation of PPAR-γ inhibited the AP-1 and NF-κB activation in ECs. In addition, the VP-PPAR-γ reduced AP-1 and NF-κB DNA binding, which may lead to decreases in their transactivation. It is well known that both AP-1 and NF-κB play pivotal roles in the transcriptional regulation of ICAM-1 and other pro-inflammatory genes (21Collins T. Cybulsky M.I. J. Clin. Invest. 2001; 107: 255-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (643) Google Scholar). Especially, AP-1- and NF-κB-like cis-elements have been identified in the proximal 445-bp of the 5′-flanking region of the ICAM-1 gene and found to be responsible for ICAM-1 induction by PMA and TNF-α (10Ledebur H.C. Parks T.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 933-943Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (515) Google Scholar, 12Wang N. Verna L. Hardy S. Forsayeth J. Zhu Y. Stemerman M.B. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1999; 19: 2078-2084Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). In this study, we demonstrated that mutations at these two sites are sufficient to abrogate the ICAM-1 induction as well as the suppressive effect elicited by VP-PPAR-γ. Therefore, it is conceivable that the simultaneous trans-repression of AP-1 and NF-κB may account for one of the mechanisms by which the constitutively active PPAR-γ negatively regulates endothelial adhesion molecules and pro-inflammatory processes. In the present study, the constitutively active PPAR-γ1 is a chimeric construct containing the VP16 activation domain from HSV. Expression of this construct in ECs leads to PPAR-γ activation in the absence of exogenous ligands or activators. This approach is to circumvent the receptor-independent effects that individual PPAR agonists may have. The anti-inflammatory effect described is unlikely to be attributed to a nonspecific effect of the VP16 transactivation domain because VP-PPAR-γ did not affect the basal transcription as demonstrated by the use of a Gal4-responsive reporter gene (Fig. 5A) and, more importantly, because gene induction of ICAM-1 was inhibited by the VP-PPAR-γ but not by the VP16 activation domain (Fig. 6). In addition, other studies showed that HSV infection induces pro-inflammatory vascular adhesion molecules and MAPK/AP-1 activity (22Larcher C. Gasser A. Hattmannstorfer R. Obexer P. Furhapter C. Fritsch P. Sepp N. J. Invest Dermatol. 2001; 116: 150-156Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 23Paludan S.R. J.

Conner J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 5097-5103Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Taken together, these observations support the conclusion that the anti-inflammatory effect is associated with the constitutive activation of PPAR-γ. Interestingly, PPAR-γ ligands such as 15d-PG-J2 are known to inhibit AP-1 and NF-κB DNA binding via both the receptor-dependent and -independent mechanisms (7Straus D.S. Pascual G., Li, M. Welch J.S. Ricote M. Hsiang C.H. Sengchanthalangsy L.L. Ghosh G. Glass C.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 4844-4849Crossref PubMed Scopus (947) Google Scholar). In this respect, the PPAR-γ constitutive activation model described in this study may mimic the PPAR-γ-dependent action in a ligand-activated context. The receptor-independent mechanisms may account for pleiotropic effects of individual pharmacological PPAR agonists. For the time being, the exact pathways leading to a trans-repression of these transcription factors remain unclear. These are clearly important issues for future study. Nevertheless, the conditional expression of VP-PPAR-γ established in this study will be helpful in elucidating the pathophysiological functions of this receptor in vessel walls. Most importantly, our finding that a constitutively active form of PPAR-γ prevents endothelial activation and leukocyte recruitment may represent an approach to control the vascular inflammatory processes. In conclusion, we have demonstrated a direct anti-inflammatory role for PPAR-γ. Specifically modifying PPAR-γ activity in ECs may have potential application in the treatment of various pro-inflammatory disorders, including arthritis, atherosclerosis, and inflammatory bowel disease."

Expression of the Abca1 gene is under control of the liver X receptor (LXR). We have evaluated effects of LXR activation by the synthetic agonist T0901317 on hepatic and intestinal cholesterol metabolism in C57BL/6J and DBA/1 wild-type mice and in ABCA1-deficient DBA/1 mice. In wild-type mice, T0901317 increased expression of Abca1 in liver and intestine, which was associated with an approximately 60% rise in HDL. Biliary cholesterol excretion rose 2.7-fold upon treatment, and fecal neutral sterol output was increased by 150-300%. Plasma cholesterol levels also increased in treated Abca1(-/-) mice (+120%), but exclusively in very low density lipoprotein-sized fractions. Despite the absence of HDL, hepatobiliary cholesterol output was stimulated upon LXR activation in Abca1(-/-) mice, leading to a 250% increase in the biliary cholesterol/phospholipid ratio. Most importantly, fecal neutral sterol loss was induced to a similar extent (+300%) by the LXR agonist in DBA/1 wild-type and Abca1(-/-) mice. Expression of Abcg5 and Abcg8, recently implicated in biliary excretion of cholesterol and its intestinal absorption, was induced in T0901317-treated mice. Thus, activation of LXR in mice leads to enhanced hepatobiliary cholesterol secretion and fecal neutral sterol loss independent of (ABCA1-mediated) elevation of HDL and the presence of ABCA1 in liver and intestine."

We reported that alterations in Nm23 sequence affected one aspect of metastasis, suppression of in vitro motility. Mutation of Nm23-H1 proline 96 (P96S), involved inDrosophila development (67Biggs J. Hersperger E. Dearolf C. Shearn A. Genes Dev. 1988; 2: 1333-1343Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), or serine 120 (S120G), a site of mutation in human neuroblastomas (68Chang C. Zhu X.-x. Thoraval D.

Biochemical analysis of the recombinant proteins indicated that P96S resulted in a histidine protein kinase-deficient mutant in assays using succinic thiokinase, Nm23-H2, and aldolase; the S120G mutant resulted in reduced Nm23-H1 histidine autophosphorylation and aldolase phosphorylation (28Wagner P.D.

These data prompted the hypothesis that a histidine protein kinase activity may contribute to the motility-suppressive effect of Nm23-H1. The Nm23-H1 P96S mutant also exhibited loss of function in the non-GTP regeneration interaction with the muscarinic receptor G-protein (58Otero A. Doyle M. Hartsough M. Steeg P. Biochemica Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1449: 157-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). Cho et al. (70Cho S. Lee N. Jung Y. Lee H. Lee K. Kim E. Chae S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 289: 738-743Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) reported that the Nm23-H1 P96S and S120G mutations exhibited transactivational activity comparable with that of wild type protein, separating this function and motility suppression. Other biochemical functions have not been reported in this model system to date. We searched for proteins that interacted with histidine protein kinases, which might represent candidate signaling pathways for the Nm23-H1-suppressive capacity. Histidine protein kinases are prominent members of the “two-component” or histidyl-aspartyl pathways of prokaryotes and lower eukaryotes. In the simplest scenario, an external signal interacts with a receptor, which leads to a histidine autophosphorylation of a sensor kinase, the phosphate of which is passed to an aspartate of a response regulator protein, resulting in signal propagation (reviewed in Refs. 71Egger L. Park H. Inouye M. Genes Cells. 1997; 2: 167-184Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 72Stock A. Robinson V. Goudreau P. Annu. Rev.

When cloned into anEscherichia coli “two-component system,” Nm23 functioned as a histidine sensor kinase (31Lu Q. Park H. Egger L. Inouye M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32886-32893Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). We conducted a search in silico for proteins interacting with “two-component” histidine sensor kinases and having mammalian homologs. None were found among bacterial response regulator proteins. In Arabidopsis, the ethylene receptor controls differentiation through a complex “two-component” pathway (74Hua J. Meyerowitz E. Cell. 1998; 94: 261-271Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (779) Google Scholar) (reviewed in Refs. 75Chang C. Stadler R.

Whereas many of the Arabidopsis “two-component” proteins were hybrids, a single protein containing both the sensor histidine protein kinase and aspartate regulator domains, the Arabidopsis ERS histidine sensor kinase was found by two-hybrid analysis to interact with the N-terminal portion of CTR1 (78Clark K. Larsen P. Wang X. Chang C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 95: 5401-5406Crossref Scopus (353) Google Scholar). CTR1 was not reported to be a typical aspartate-phosphorylated response protein, but led to a diminution of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)1 pathway by an unknown mechanism and thus represented a novel suppressive pathway extending from the two-component system. Whereas it was originally reported to be homologous to mammalian Raf family members (78Clark K. Larsen P. Wang X. Chang C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 95: 5401-5406Crossref Scopus (353) Google Scholar, 79Kieber J. Rothenberg M. Roman G. Feldmann K. Ecker J.

In this paper, we present evidence for an interaction of Nm23-H1 and KSR in mammalian cells as well as evidence that Nm23-H1 can phosphorylate KSR in a complex manner in vitro via a histidine-dependent pathway. Our data provide evidence for a new type of signaling pathway in mammalian cells. FLAG-tagged Raf-1, N-terminal Raf-1, C-terminal Raf-1, and Pyo-tagged murine KSR, N-terminal KSR (amino acids 1–539), C-terminal KSR (amino acids 542–873), KSR-AA and KSR-AAA cDNA constructs, anti-Pyo, and rabbit anti-KSR were all previously described (82Cacace A.

Forty-eight h post-transfection, cells were analyzed. Alternatively, 293T cells were transfected using the Effectene transfection reagent (Qiagen), using 3 μg of DNA by the manufacturer's protocol. The cell culture medium was changed 24 h post-transfection, and cells were harvested 48 h post-transfection. MDA-MB-435 human breast carcinoma cells were plated at a density of 2.6 × 106 cells/100-mm plate and transfected by the calcium phosphate method with 15 μg of cDNA plasmid as per the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen). Twenty-four h after transfection, harvested cells were glycerol shocked, the medium was changed, and cells were used the following day. MDA-MB-435 cells were also transfected using Effectene as described above. Cells were washed twice in 1× phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in Nonidet P-40 (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 137 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1% Nonidet P-40, 2 mmEDTA, aprotinin (0.15 units/ml), 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 20 μm leupeptin, 5 mm sodium vanadate) or in radioimmune precipitation buffer (20 mmTris-HCl, pH 8, 137 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 2 mm EDTA, aprotinin (0.15 units/ml), 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 20 μm leupeptin, 5 mm sodium vanadate. Particulates were removed from the lysate by centrifugation at 14,000 × g at 4 °C for 10 min. Cleared lysates were frozen at −80 °C until use. Lysates were normalized to equivalent total protein (BCA; Pierce) prior to immunoprecipitation. Immunoprecipitation assays were performed by incubating cell lysates with either anti-Pyo, anti-Nm23 (antibody 301), rabbit anti-KSR, or anti-FLAG and either Protein A/G-agarose (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA) or Protein G-agarose (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) for 2 h at 4 °C. The immunoprecipitates were washed four times in lysis buffer prior to separation by SDS-PAGE and transfer to a nitrocellulose membrane. The membrane was then immunoblotted with anti-Pyo, rabbit anti-KSR, anti-Nm23 (anti-peptide 11) or anti-FLAG, followed by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody. Proteins were visualized by ECL (Amersham Biosciences). Five μg of recombinant Nm23 proteins (wild type, P96S, S120G, H118F) were incubated in TMD buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol with 330 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (final concentration 0.33 μm) (ICN) for 10 min at 25 °C. Free [γ-32P]ATP was removed by gel filtration through a PD-10 column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated in HMD buffer (30 mm Hepes, pH 7.8, 10 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm dithiothreitol). An additional sample containing [γ-32P]ATP and no Nm23 protein, was run through the PD-10 column, and the flow-through was collected to be used as a control for contaminating free [γ-32P]ATP. The absence of detectable amounts of free [γ-32P]ATP was checked by thin layer chromatography. KSR or Raf-1 proteins were immunoprecipitated as described above, except that the immunoprecipitants were washed three times in 1× phosphate-buffered saline containing 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, and protease inhibitors (Mini Complete™ protease inhibitor mixture; Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and then twice in HMD buffer. The precipitated KSR proteins were then incubated in 15 μl of HMD buffer containing 106 cpm of 32P-Nm23 proteins (∼50–100 ng/312 nm) for 10 min at 25 °C. The reactions were terminated by the addition of SDS-loading buffer, pH 6.8. Samples were boiled 5 min prior to protein separation by SDS-PAGE and transfer to nitrocellulose. Phosphorylated proteins were detected by autoradiography; protein quantitation was determined by immunoblotting and ECL.

https://openalex.org/W1969361812,"The O(2) equilibria of human adult hemoglobin have been measured in a wide range of solution conditions in the presence and absence of various allosteric effectors in order to determine how far hemoglobin can modulate its O(2) affinity. The O(2) affinity, cooperative behavior, and the Bohr effect of hemoglobin are modulated principally by tertiary structural changes, which are induced by its interactions with heterotropic allosteric effectors. In their absence, hemoglobin is a high affinity, moderately cooperative O(2) carrier of limited functional flexibility, the behaviors of which are regulated by the homotropic, O(2)-linked T/R quaternary structural transition of the Monod-Wyman-Changeux/Perutz model. However, the interactions with allosteric effectors provide such inert hemoglobin unprecedented magnitudes of functional diversities not only of physiological relevance but also of extreme nature, by which hemoglobin can behave energetically beyond what can be explained by the Monod-Wyman-Changeux/Perutz model. Thus, the heterotropic effector-linked tertiary structural changes rather than the homotropic ligation-linked T/R quaternary structural transition are energetically more significant and primarily responsible for modulation of functions of hemoglobin."

In some instances, SsrA tagging of otherwise full-length proteins occurs when the ribosome pauses at stop codons during normal translation termination. Here, the identities of the C-terminal residues of the nascent chain are shown to play an important role in full-length protein tagging. Specifically, a subset of C-terminal Xaa-Pro sequences caused SsrA tagging of the full-length YbeL protein fromEscherichia coli. This tagging increased when a less efficient stop codon was used, increased in cells lacking protein release factor-3, and decreased when protein release factor-1 was overexpressed. Incorporation of the analog azetidine-2-carboxylic acid in place of proline suppressed tagging, whereas incorporation of 3,4-dehydroproline increased SsrA tagging of full-length YbeL.

SsrA also contains a short open reading frame, which inEscherichia coli encodes the sequence ANDENYALAA (3Tu G.F. Reid G.E. Zhang J.G. Moritz R.L. Simpson R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9322-9326Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). The tmRNA model of SsrA activity postulates that SsrA enters the empty A-site of stalled ribosomes and adds its charged alanine to the nascent polypeptide by transpeptidation. A conformational change then occurs that allows translation to shift from the original mRNA to the ANDENYALAA reading frame within SsrA. As a result, the stalled ribosome is freed from the problematic mRNA, and the SsrA-encoded peptide tag is added to the C terminus of the nascent polypeptide. The SsrA tag is recognized by multiple proteases in E. coli, resulting in rapid degradation of SsrA-tagged proteins (4Keiler K.C. Waller P.R. Sauer R.T.

The identity of the stop codon can affect SsrA tagging of full-length proteins, with less efficient stop codons leading to higher levels of tagging (10Hayes C.S. Bose B. Sauer R.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 3440-3445Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Because termination of translation is a relatively slow process compared with translation elongation (11Freistroffer D.V. Kwiatkowski M. Buckingham R.H. Ehrenberg M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 2046-2051Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar), SsrA and protein release factors probably compete for binding to the A-site, while the ribosome idles at an inefficient stop codon. However, SsrA tagging of full-length proteins encoded by genes with efficient stop signals has also been observed (12Roche E.D. Sauer R.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 76: 28509-28515Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (108) Google Scholar). For example, the intact E. coli YbeL protein is tagged (12Roche E.D. Sauer R.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 76: 28509-28515Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (108) Google Scholar) even though the ybeL coding region ends with an extended UAAU stop signal which is thought to be the most efficient translation termination signal in E. coli (13Poole E.S. Brown C.M. Tate W.P. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 151-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar, 14Tate W.P. Mannering S.A. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 21: 213-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). In this paper, we dissect the YbeL system to identify the determinants that lead to its efficient tagging by SsrA. Mutational analyses of the last two residues of YbeL demonstrated that the proline residue at the C terminus and the identity of the penultimate residue are major determinants of SsrA tagging. Moreover, substituting proline for the C-terminal residue of thioredoxin, a protein that is not normally tagged, resulted in efficient SsrA-tagging of this variant. Tagging of full-length YbeL was modulated by the identity of the stop codon and by the cellular level of protein release factors. The incorporation of proline analogs into YbeL significantly affected SsrA tagging at the stop codon, suggesting that the structure of the nascent polypeptide is a primary determinant of SsrA tagging of YbeL. TableI lists the E. coli strains and plasmids used in this study.

A region of DNA upstream of the prfC gene was PCR amplified from genomic DNA using oligonucleotides prfC-SacI (5′-TAT GAG CTC GAA CAG GCG GGC AAT CCT GAC CG) and prfC-BamHI (5′-TAA GGA TCC AAC GTC ATA ATT CTT TCT TCT TGA); and a region of DNA downstream of prfCwas amplified using oligonucleotides prfC-EcoRI (5′-GAA GAA TTC AAG CGT AAG AAC GAA AGC CAA CTG) and prfC-KpnI (5′-ACC GGT ACC TAA CGC CGT CAG AAA TGT CAT CAC). The upstream and downstream PCR products were sequentially cloned into plasmid pKAN to generate plasmid pKAN-ΔprfC. The chromosomal prfC gene was deleted by transformation of cells with linear DNA from aSacI-KpnI digest of plasmid pKAN-ΔprfC and selection for kanamycin resistance (15Datsenko K.A. Wanner B.L. Proc.

Plasmid pCP20, which carries a thermal-inducible FLP recombinase, was used to remove the kanamycin resistance cassette from the chromosome (15Datsenko K.A. Wanner B.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Plasmids pRF-3, pRF-1, and pRRF are derivatives of pCH405 and contain the genes encoding protein RF-3, protein RF-1, and RRF, respectively. The genes encoding RF-3 (prfC), RF-1 (prfA), and RRF (frr) were amplified by PCR from E. coli genomic DNA using the following oligonucleotide primers that contain restriction sites (underlined) to facilitate cloning: RF3-FOR, 5′-TATGAG CTC GAA CAG GCG GGC AAT CCT GAC CG; RF3-REV, 5′-ACCGGT ACC TAA CGC CGT CAG AAA TGT CAT CAC; RF1-FOR, 5′-TGCGAG CTC AAA GCG CCA GCG AAA CCA TTC GCG; RF1-REV, 5′-CCCGGT ACC CGT CCC GAG ATC GAG AAT ACG GC; RRF-FOR, 5′-AAAGAG CTC AAA GTC ATG GAC CTG GCG GCC TTC; RRF-REV, 5′-TGTGGT ACC ATG CGA GTG ACA TTT TTG CCT GCC. The PCR products were digested with SacI and KpnI and ligated intoSacI/KpnI digested pCH405. All plasmids that overexpress wild-type and mutant forms of YbeL were derived from plasmids pET11d or pET24d, which contain the T7 φ10 promoter. Plasmid pYbeL contains the wild-type ybeL gene and was constructed by PCR amplification of the ybeL gene fromE. coli genomic DNA using primers YBEL-FOR (5′-ATG AAACCA TGG ACA AGG TTG CTC AAT ATT ACC) and YBEL-REV (5′-GAA AGG ATC CTA TTA CGG CTC AAA CGG GCG TCT CTG GAA CTG G. The PCR product was digested with NcoI and BamHI and ligated into NcoI/BamHI-digested pET11d. Plasmid expression libraries containing randomized codons at the last position or the penultimate position were generated by PCR using primer YBEL-FOR with the following reverse oligonucleotide primers: YBEL(-1)LIB-REV, 5′-GAA AGG ATC CTA TTA NNN CTC AAA CGG GCG TCT CTG GAA CTG G; YBEL(-2)LIB-REV, 5′-GAA AGG ATC CTA TTA CGGNNN AAA CGG GCG TCT CTG GAA CTG G; OPAL(-2)LIB-REV, 5′-GAA AGG ATC CTA TCA CGG NNN AAA CGG GCG TCT CTG GAA CTG G; and AMBER(-2)LIB-REV, 5′-GAA AGG ATC CTA CTA CGGNNN AAA CGG GCG TCT CTG GAA CTG G. These PCR products were digested with NcoI and BamHI, ligated toNcoI/BamHI digested pET11d, and electroporated into E. coli strain JM83. Strain CH113/pCH201 was transformed with YbeL expression plasmid libraries followed by overnight culture in LB broth supplemented with 100 μg/ml ampicillin and 20 μg/ml tetracycline. The overnight cultures were diluted into 50 ml of fresh media to an optical density at 600 nm (OD600) of 0.1 and grown at 37 °C until the culture reached an OD600 of ∼1. Expression of YbeL was induced by the addition of IPTG to final concentration of 1.5 mm, followed by growth at 37 °C for 2.5 h. Cultures were harvested, frozen at −80 °C and lysed in 12 ml of urea lysis buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, (pH 8.0), 8m urea, 100 mm NaCl) with stirring for 20 min at room temperature. SsrA(ANDH6D)-tagged proteins were purified by Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid (Ni2+-NTA) affinity chromatography (Qiagen) using urea lysis buffer as the column buffer. SsrA(ANDH6D)-tagged protein was eluted with 1.6 ml of elution buffer (2 m urea, 100 mm acetic acid), the pH of the eluate was adjusted pH ∼8 with 2 m Tris-HCl (pH 9.5), and trypsin (0.04 mg/ml; Worthington Biochemicals) was added for 3 h at 37 °C. YbeL-AANDH6D junction peptides were purified by a second round of Ni2+-NTA affinity chromatography, eluted with 0.06% trifluoroacetic acid, and chromatographed on a 3.9 × 300-mm reverse phase C4 column (Vydac). Peptides were detected by UV absorption at 214 nm and identified by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI) mass spectrometry at the MIT Biopolymers laboratory. Strains of E. coli CH113 and CH468 containing plasmid pCH201 and YbeL expression plasmids were grown overnight at 37 °C in LB broth supplemented with 100 μg/ml ampicillin and 20 μg/ml tetracyline. New cultures were started the following day by resuspending samples to an OD600 of 0.2 in fresh media. After growth for 2 h at 37 °C, protein synthesis was induced by the addition of IPTG to a final concentration of 1.5 mm, followed by growth for 2 h. 1.0-ml samples were removed and harvested by centrifugation. The supernatant was aspirated, and the cell pellet was frozen immediately at −80 °C. Samples for Western blot analysis were extracted from cell pellets by vigorous vortexing in 60 μl of urea lysis buffer, centrifuged in a microcentrifuge at top speed for 10 min, and the urea-soluble total protein was collected as the supernatant. Protein concentration was estimated by Bradford assay and equal amounts of total urea-soluble protein were resolved by 10% Tris-tricine SDS-PAGE. Proteins were transferred to Immobilon-P (Millipore) polyvinylidene fluoride membranes using standard Western blotting procedures. SsrA(ANDH6D)-tagged proteins were detected by using His-probe H15 antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and SsrA(DD)-tagged proteins were detected with rabbit polyclonal antisera as described (8Roche E.D. Sauer R.T. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4579-4589Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar, 10Hayes C.S. Bose B. Sauer R.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 3440-3445Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Overnight cultures of strain CH522 containing YbeL expression plasmids and plasmids pCH201 or pKW23 were resuspended at an OD600 of 0.05 in glucose minimal medium supplemented with 1 μg/ml thiamine, 50 μm proline, 450 μm arginine, and appropriate antibiotics. Minimal medium cultures (100 ml) were grown at 37 °C to an OD600 between 0.6 and 0.9, IPTG was added to a final concentration of 1.5 mm, and growth was continued for 10 min. The culture was then split into four aliquots (25 ml each), and proline analogs were added to a final concentration of 1 mm. Proline was added to the control culture (50 μm), and the four cultures were grown for an additional 2.5 h at 37 °C. Cells were harvested and processed as described above. We initially used a library approach to determine whether the identity of the C-terminal residues of E. coli YbeL or their coding sequences influenced tagging. The codons for the C-terminal residue or the penultimate residue were randomized in separate experiments (Fig.1A), and the mixture of resulting YbeL proteins was expressed in a strain lacking wild-type SsrA but containing a SsrA variant encoding an ANDH6D tag. Proteins tagged by SsrA(ANDH6D) are not degraded rapidly, can be purified by Ni2+-NTA affinity chromatography, and can be detected by anti-His6 antibodies. For these experiments, tagged proteins were purified by Ni2+-NTA chromatography and digested with trypsin. Following additional purification, junction peptides between YbeL and the AANDH6D tag were identified by mass spectrometry. YbeL expressed from the wild-type gene yielded a single YbeL-AANDH6D junction peptide with a mass corresponding to the C-terminal tryptic peptide of YbeL joined to the AANDH6D tag (Table II, Fig.1A). Following randomization of the C-terminal or (−1) YbeL position, this same junction peptide was recovered, but no other peptides corresponding to full-length protein tagging were identified (Table II). This result suggested that substitution of the C-terminal proline of YbeL eliminated or reduced tagging. Numerous full-length junction peptides were identified from the (−2) position library (Table II), including those containing Glu, Asp, Ala, Ser, Gly, Pro, Val, Tyr, Phe, and His residues at this position. Full-length junction peptides containing either Ile/Leu or Lys/Gln at the (−2) position were also identified but could not be differentiated because of mass equivalence (Table II). The recovery of a large number of different tagged peptides in this experiment indicated that efficient tagging occurs with many different amino acids or codons at the penultimate position when the C-terminal residue is proline.Table IIMALDI mass spectrometry of YbeL-AANDH6D junction peptidesRandom codon libraryPredicted YbeL-AANDH6D junction peptide2-aYbeL portion of the junction peptide is given in one-letter code.Measured mass of junction peptideCalculated average mass of predicted junction peptideDaDaWild-typeRPFEP-tag1954.841955.0(−1)RPFEP-tag1954.871955.0(−2)RPFAP-tag1896.831897.0RPFDP-tag1940.911941.0RPFEP-tag1954.831955.0RPFFP-tag1972.961973.1RPFGP-tag1882.821883.0RPFHP-tag1962.931963.1RPFI(L)P-tag1938.961939.1 (1939.1)RPFK(Q)P-tag1954.041954.1 (1954.1)RPFPP-tag1922.941923.0RPFSP-tag1912.821913.0RPFVP-tag1924.811925.1RPFYP-tag1988.911989.12-a YbeL portion of the junction peptide is given in one-letter code. Open table in a new tab Individual clones representing four amino acid substitutions at the (−1) position and all possible substitutions at the (−2) position were isolated from the libraries and Western blot analysis was used to examine YbeL tagging (Fig. 1). Mutation of the wild-type proline at the (−1) position to Ala, Leu, Lys, or Ser resulted in large reductions in the level of SsrA tagging (Fig. 1B). At the (−2) position, high levels of tagging were seen for proteins containing Glu (wild type), Asp, Ile, Val, and Pro; moderate levels of tagging were observed for Ala, Gly, Ser, Tyr, Gln, Phe, and Lys; and low levels of tagging resulted from substitution by Met, Thr, His, Cys, Trp, Leu, Asn, and Arg (Fig. 1C). Is a C-terminal proline sufficient to cause SsrA tagging at stop codons in other genetic contexts? As shown in Fig.2A, wild-type thioredoxin (TrxA) from E. coli is not tagged significantly by SsrA(ANDH6D). We constructed variant trxA genes encoding C-terminal Ala → Pro or Leu-Ala → Glu-Pro substitutions (Glu-Pro is the C-terminal sequence of YbeL). Both variants were efficiently tagged by SsrA(ANDH6D) (Fig.2A). Mass spectrometry of the purified TrxA-AANDH6D junction peptides confirmed that tagging occurred at the C terminus of the full-length thioredoxin variants (data not shown). Thus, a single C-terminal proline was sufficient to induce tagging at a stop codon where it did not occur normally. Studies of translation termination have suggested that interactions between the protein release factors that decode stop codons and certain P-site tRNAs may lead to inefficient translation termination (16Arkov A.L. Korolev S.V. Kisselev L.L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 2891-2897Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 17Zhang S. Ryden-Aulin M. Isaksson L.A. J. Mol.

Ryden-Aulin M. Isaksson L.A. FEBS Lett. 1999; 455: 355-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Proline is encoded by four codons (CCA, CCC, CCG, and CCU), which are decoded by three tRNAPro species inE. coli. To determine whether a specific proline codon or tRNAPro was required for tagging, we constructedybeL variants with all possible proline codons at the (−1) position. As shown in Fig. 2B, YbeL was tagged efficiently in each case. These results are consistent with a model in which the proline residue in the nascent chain causes tagging. Alternatively, codon-specific or tRNA-specific sequence determinants may be shared by all proline codons and/or tRNAPro combinations. If SsrA tagging at the C terminus of YbeL is caused, in part, by prolonged pausing at the ybeL stop codon, then mutations that increase pausing should acerbate tagging andvice versa. The ybeL gene uses an ochre (UAA) stop codon. To determine the importance of the termination codon, new (−2) position YbeL libraries were made with amber (UAG) or opal (UGA) termination codons. The YbeL-AANDH6D junction peptides from the amber library were identical to those from the original ochre library, although peptide yields were lower from the amber library (data not shown). By contrast, there was an increase in the relative yields of several peptides from the opal library, including those containing His, Phe, Tyr, Ile/Leu, and Gln/Lys residues at the (−2) position (data not shown). Fig. 3 shows a comparison of YbeL tagging for constructs with ochre or opal stop codons and Glu, Ala, Phe, His, Lys, Leu, Asn, Trp, and Tyr at the (−2) position. For all pairs except one where tagging could not be detected (Fig. 3), the level of tagging was higher for the construct with the less efficient (UGA) than more efficient (UAA) stop codon. This increase was particularly striking with His, Lys, Leu, or Tyr at the (−2) position (Fig. 3). The efficiency of translation termination depends on the levels of the decoding protein release factors as well as the identity of the stop codon. Ochre stop codons are recognized by release factors RF-1 and RF-2. Tagging of wild-type YbeL, which terminates with an ochre codon, was substantially decreased in cells carrying a multi-copy plasmid encoding the prfA gene for RF-1 (Fig.4A). Overexpression of RF-1 also decreased tagging of a YbeL variant ending in Pro-Pro, which is normally tagged at very high levels (Fig. 4A). We did not examine the effects of overexpression of RF-2, which has been reported to be lethal (20Dincbas-Renqvist V. Engstrom A. Mora L. Heurgue-Hamard V. Buckingham R. Ehrenberg M. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 6900-6907Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). RF-3 increases the rate of RF-1 and RF-2 dissociation from the ribosome after peptidyl-tRNA hydrolysis (21Freistroffer D.V. Pavlov M.Y. MacDougall J. Buckingham R.H. Ehrenberg M. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4126-4133Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar, 22Zavialov A.V. Buckingham R.H. Ehrenberg M.

Ito K. Nakamura Y. Tate W.P. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 727-732Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). YbeL tagging increased significantly in ΔprfC cells lacking RF-3 (Fig.4B) but occurred at normal levels in these cells when theprfC gene was provided on a plasmid (Fig. 4B). RRF facilitates the dissociation of ribosomal subunits after peptidyl-tRNA hydrolysis (24Pavlov M.Y. Freistroffer D.V. MacDougall J. Buckingham R.H. Ehrenberg M. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4134-4141Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 25Janosi L. Mottagui-Tabar S. Isaksson L.A. Sekine Y. Ohtsubo E. Zhang S. Goon S. Nelken S. Shuda M. Kaji A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1141-1151Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Overexpression of RRF caused a small decrease in the levels of SsrA tagging of full-length YbeL (Fig.4A). Thus, changes in the levels of release factors that would be expected to make translation termination less efficient result in increased levels of YbeL tagging by SsrA tagging and vice versa. The proline analogs azetidine-2-carboxylic acid, γ-thiaproline, and 3,4-dehydroproline are incorporated into proteins in E. coli(26Budisa N. Minks C. Medrano F.J. Lutz J. Huber R. Moroder L. Proc.

Using a proline auxotrophic strain, we examined the effects of these proline analogs on SsrA tagging of a variant of YbeL containing a His6 sequence before the last four residues of the wild-type protein (Fig. 5). The His6 epitope allowed the C-terminal tryptic peptide of YbeL (Fig. 5A) to be purified by Ni2+-NTA affinity chromatography and then analyzed by reverse-phase HPLC and MALDI mass spectrometry to assay incorporation of the analogs (Fig. 5B; Table III). Incorporation of 3,4-dehydroproline for both proline residues in the C-terminal tryptic peptide of YbeL was complete, and incorporation of azetidine-2-carboxylic acid occurred at >95% efficiency (Fig. 5; Table III). γ-Thiaproline incorporation was more variable, but the major C-terminal peptide species contained two γ-thiaproline residues (Fig. 5B; Table III).Table IIIProline analog incorporation into C-terminal YbeL(His6) tryptic peptidesHPLC peak3-aHPLC peaks are numbered as in Fig. 5B.Predicted peptide3-bAbbreviations are as follows: Az, azetidine-2-carboxylic acid; tP, γ-thiaproline; dP, 3,4-dehydroproline.Measured mass3-cPeptide masses were determined by MALDI mass spectrometry.Calculated average massDaDaProline1H6PFEP1312.531312.42H6PFEP-AANDENYALDD2504.172504.6Azetidine-2-carboxylate1H6(Az)FE(Az)1284.551284.42H6PFE(Az) or H6(Az)FEP1298.601298.43H6PFE(Az) or H6(Az)FEP1298.571298.4γ-Thiaproline1H6(tP)FEP or H6PFE(tP)1330.641330.52H6(tP)FE(tP)1348.531348.63,4-Dehydroproline1H6(dP)FE(dP)1308.521308.42H6(dP)FE(dP)-AANDENYALDD2500.142500.63-a HPLC peaks are nu"
https://openalex.org/W2130838656,"Fibroblasts derived from focal adhesion kinase (FAK)-null mouse embryos have a reduced migration rate and an increase in the number and size of peripherally localized adhesions (Ilic, D., Furuta, Y., Kanazawa, S., Takeda, N., Sobue, K., Nakatsuji, N., Nomura, S., Fujimoto, J., Okada, M., and Yamamoto, T. (1995)Nature 377, 539–544). In this study, we have found that Y27632, a specific inhibitor for Rho-associated kinase (Rho-kinase), dramatically reversed the round cell morphology of FAK−/−cells to a spread fibroblast-like shape in 30 min and significantly enhanced their motility. The effects of Y27632 on the FAK−/− cell morphology and motility were concomitant with reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton and redistribution of focal adhesions. Conversely, the expression of the constitutively active Rho-kinase in FAK+/+ cells led to round cell shape and inhibition of cell motility. Furthermore, coincident with the formation of cortical actin filaments, myosin light chain (MLC), Ser-19-phosphorylated MLC, and MLC kinase mainly accumulated at the FAK−/− cell periphery. We found that the disruption of actin filaments by cytochalasin D prevented the peripheral accumulation of MLC kinase and that inhibition of myosin-mediated contractility by 2,3-butanedione monoxime induced FAK−/−cells to spread. Taken together, our results suggest that Rho-kinase may mediate the formation of cortical actomyosin filaments at the FAK−/− cell periphery, which further recruits MLC kinase to the cell periphery and generates a non-polar contractile force surrounding the cell, leading to cell rounding and decreased motility. Fibroblasts derived from focal adhesion kinase (FAK)-null mouse embryos have a reduced migration rate and an increase in the number and size of peripherally localized adhesions (Ilic, D., Furuta, Y., Kanazawa, S., Takeda, N., Sobue, K., Nakatsuji, N., Nomura, S., Fujimoto, J., Okada, M., and Yamamoto, T. (1995)Nature 377, 539–544). In this study, we have found that Y27632, a specific inhibitor for Rho-associated kinase (Rho-kinase), dramatically reversed the round cell morphology of FAK−/−cells to a spread fibroblast-like shape in 30 min and significantly enhanced their motility. The effects of Y27632 on the FAK−/− cell morphology and motility were concomitant with reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton and redistribution of focal adhesions. Conversely, the expression of the constitutively active Rho-kinase in FAK+/+ cells led to round cell shape and inhibition of cell motility.

Among the Rho GTPase family, Rho induces the formation of focal adhesions and stress fibers (7Nobes C.D. Hall A.

Interestingly, although a basal level of Rho activity is needed for fibroblast migration, too much Rho activity impedes migration (4Nobes C.D. Hall A. J.

It has been shown that the concerted action of two of the immediate Rho targets, Rho-associated kinase (Rho-kinase)1/ROCK and the formin homology protein mDia1, mediate the effect of Rho on matrix adhesion and the actin cytoskeleton (11Watanabe N. Kato T. Fujita A. Ishizaki T. Narumiya S. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 136-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (727) Google Scholar). In particular, Rho-kinase was shown to stimulate myosin-driven contractility in smooth muscle and nonmuscle cells by phosphorylating, thereby inactivating myosin light chain (MLC) phosphatase (12Kimura K. Ito M. Amano M. Chihara K. Fukata Y. Nakafuku M. Yamamori B. Feng J. Nakano T. Okawa K. Iwamatsu A. Kaibuchi K. Science. 1996; 273: 245-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (2444) Google Scholar, 13Kawano Y.

Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 797-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (542) Google Scholar). In addition to Rho-kinase, MLC kinase (MLCK) is another kinase that phosphorylates the MLC in both smooth muscle and nonmuscle cells (17Kamm K.E. Stull J.T. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1985; 25: 593-620Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18Kamm K.E. Stull J.T. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1989; 51: 299-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). The phosphorylation of MLC on Ser-19 and to a lesser extent on Thr-18 by MLCK promotes the assembly of myosin II into filaments and activates its ATPase activity, which stabilizes the actin-myosin interaction and promotes cell contractility (19Sellers J.R.

Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 26-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar). Recently, Rho-kinase and MLCK were suggested to play distinct roles in spatial regulation of MLC phosphorylation. Rho-kinase appears to be important for MLC phosphorylation in the center of cells, and MLCK is responsible for phosphorylating MLC at the cell periphery (16Totsukawa G. Yamakita Y. Yamashiro S. Hartshorne D.J. Sasaki Y. Matsumura F. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 797-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (542) Google Scholar). Focal adhesion kinase (FAK), a 125-kDa cytoplasmic tyrosine kinase localized in focal contacts, has been known to play an important role in integrin-mediated cell migration (23Ilic D. Furuta Y. Kanazawa S. Takeda N. Sobue K. Nakatsuji N. Nomura S. Fujimoto J. Okada M. Yamamoto T. Nature. 1995; 377: 539-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (1591) Google Scholar). Fibroblasts derived from FAK-null mouse embryos are more rounded and poorly spread than their wild-type counterparts (23Ilic D. Furuta Y. Kanazawa S. Takeda N. Sobue K. Nakatsuji N. Nomura S. Fujimoto J. Okada M. Yamamoto T. Nature. 1995; 377: 539-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (1591) Google Scholar). They show an overabundance of focal adhesions, enriched cortical actin filaments at the cell periphery, and a decreased migration rate (23Ilic D. Furuta Y. Kanazawa S. Takeda N. Sobue K. Nakatsuji N. Nomura S. Fujimoto J. Okada M. Yamamoto T. Nature. 1995; 377: 539-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (1591) Google Scholar, 24Ren X.D. Kiosses W.B. Sieg D.J. Otey C.A. Schlaepfer D.D. Schwartz M.A. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 3673-3678Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It has been suggested that the increase in peripheral adhesions results from an inhibition of turnover in FAK−/− cells (23Ilic D. Furuta Y. Kanazawa S. Takeda N. Sobue K. Nakatsuji N. Nomura S. Fujimoto J. Okada M. Yamamoto T. Nature. 1995; 377: 539-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (1591) Google Scholar), which may result from constitutive activation of Rho (24Ren X.D. Kiosses W.B. Sieg D.J. Otey C.A. Schlaepfer D.D. Schwartz M.A. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 3673-3678Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Because of the known involvement of Rho-kinase and MLCK in cell contractility, a major factor controlling cell migration, we hypothesize that abnormal regulation of Rho-kinase and MLCK may underlie the migratory defect of FAK−/−cells. Fetal bovine serum, non-essential amino acids, sodium pyruvate, and 2-mercaptoethanol were purchased from Invitrogen. Y27632, a specific inhibitor of Rho-kinase, was purchased fromCalbiochem. The monoclonal anti-MLCK, monoclonal anti-MLC, monoclonal anti-β-tubulin, bovine MLC, myelin basic protein (MBP), cytochalasin D, and 2,3-butanedione monoxime (BDM) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. The polyclonal anti-Rho-kinase and monoclonal anti-paxillin were purchased from Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY). The plasmid pEGFP-N1-MLCK and polyclonal anti-MLCK were described previously (25Poperechnaya A. Varlamova O. Lin P.-J. Stull J.T. Bresnick A.R. J.

Monoclonal anti-Ser-19-phosphorylated MLC was kindly provided by Dr. M. Ikebe (27Komatsu S. Yano T. Shibata M. Tuft R.A. Ikebe M. J. Biol.

Ilic (University of California, San Francisco, CA) and described previously (23Ilic D. Furuta Y. Kanazawa S. Takeda N. Sobue K. Nakatsuji N. Nomura S. Fujimoto J. Okada M. Yamamoto T. Nature. 1995; 377: 539-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (1591) Google Scholar). These cells were maintained in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 μm non-essential amino acids, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, and 55 μm 2-mercaptoethanol and cultured at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 and 95% air atmosphere. Transient transfections were performed using LipofectAMINE Plus (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. FAK−/− cells were grown on glass coverslips with 0.17 mm in thickness and 42 mm in diameter. The monolayer of cells was wounded by manual scratching with a pipette tip and then treated with or without 10 μm Y27632. Cells on the microscope stage were maintained at 37 °C with a humid CO2 atmosphere in a microcultivation system (model POC-R, Zeiss) with temperature and CO2 control devices (Tempcontrol 37-2 digital and CTI controller 3700 digital, Zeiss). Cells were monitored under differential interference contrast (DIC) optics on an inverted Zeiss microscope (Axiovert 100) using Zeiss 40X LD-Apochromat objective. Time-lapse sequential micrographs were captured per minute using a cooled CCD camera (CoolSNAP fx, Roper Scientific, Inc) and analyzed by Meta Imaging SeriesTM software (version 4.5) from Universal Imaging Corporation (West Chester, PA). Cells were plated on 13-mm glass coverslips for 24 h, washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline, fixed for 10 min in phosphate-buffered saline containing 4% paraformaldehyde, and permeabilized in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.2% Triton X-100 for 10 min. Coverslips were stained with primary antibodies for 60 min and followed by goat anti-mouse TRITC or fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) conjugated secondary antibodies (Jackson ImmunoReseach laboratories) at 4 μg/ml for 60 min. All antibodies used in immunofluorescence staining in this report are monoclonal including anti-paxillin (1:100), anti-MLCK (1:50), anti-MLC (1:100), anti-Ser-19-phosphorylated MLC (1:100), and anti-β-tubulin (1:100). TRITC-conjugated phalloidin (Sigma-Aldrich) at 2 μm was used to stain actin filaments. Coverslips were mounted in anti-fading solution and viewed using a Zeiss LSM-510 laser-scanning confocal microscope image system with a Zeiss 100X Plan-Apochromat objective (NA 1.4 oil). Cells were lysed with 1% Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer (1% Nonidet P-40, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 137 mmNaCl, 10% glycerol, and 1 mmNa3VO4) containing protease inhibitors (1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.2 trypsin inhibitory units/ml aprotinin, and 20 μg/ml leupeptin). The lysates were centrifuged for 10 min at 4 °C to remove debris, and the protein concentrations were determined using the Bio-Rad protein assay. The aliquots of lysates were subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to nitrocellulose (Schleicher & Schuell). Immunoblotting was performed with polyclonal anti-MLCK (1:1000), polyclonal anti-Rho-kinase (1:1000), or monoclonal anti-Myc (1:1000) using the Amersham Biosciences enhanced chemiluminescence system for detection. For MLCK activity assays, cell lysates were incubated with 2.5 μl of monoclonal anti-MLCK for 1.5 h at 4 °C. Immunocomplexes were collected on protein A-Sepharose beads coupled with rabbit anti-mouse IgG. The beads were washed three times with 1% Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer and one time with 20 mm Tris, pH 7.4. Kinase reactions were carried out in 40 μl of kinase buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 10 mm MgCl2, 10 mm CaCl2, 2 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.1 μm calmodulin) containing 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP and 10 μg of bovine MLC or MBP for 20 min at 25 °C. For Rho-kinase activity assays, cell lysates were incubated with 5 μl of polyclonal anti-Rho-kinase for 1 h at 4 °C. The immunocomplexes were washed and subjected to kinase reaction in 40 μl of kinase buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 10 mm MgCl2, 3 mmNaCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 1 mm EDTA) in the presence of 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP and 10 μg of MBP. Reactions were terminated by the addition of SDS sample buffer, and proteins were resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Statistical analyses were performed with a Student’s t test. Differences were considered to be statistically significant at p < 0.05. The constitutive activation of Rho has been found to correlate with the inhibition of focal adhesion turnover in FAK−/−cells (24Ren X.D. Kiosses W.B. Sieg D.J. Otey C.A. Schlaepfer D.D. Schwartz M.A. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 3673-3678Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Accordingly, we found that the activity of Rho-kinase, an immediate downstream target of Rho, in FAK−/− cells was ∼30% higher than that in FAK+/+ cells (Fig.1). To examine whether Rho-kinase mediates the effect of constitutively active Rho on the morphology of FAK−/− cells, a specific inhibitor for Rho-kinase, Y27632, was employed (28Uehata M. Ishizaki T. Satoh H. Ono T. Kawahara T. Morishita T. Tamakawa H. Yamagami K. Inui J. Maekawa M. Narumiya S. Nature. 1997; 389: 990-994Crossref PubMed Scopus (2555) Google Scholar). This pharmacological reagent was reported to be specific for Rho-kinase at 10 μm (29Ishizaki T. Uehata M. Tamechika I. Keel J. Nonomura K. Maekawa M. Narumiya S. Mol. Parmacol. 2000; 57: 976-983PubMed Google Scholar). Similar to other reports in the literature (16Totsukawa G. Yamakita Y. Yamashiro S. Hartshorne D.J. Sasaki Y. Matsumura F. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 797-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (542) Google Scholar, 30Maekawa M. Ishizaki T. Boku S. Watanabe N. Fujita A. Iwamatsu A. Obinata T. Ohashi K. Mizuno K. Narumiya S. Science. 1999; 285: 895-898Crossref PubMed Scopus (1296) Google Scholar), Y27632 at this concentration reduced the formation of actin stress fibers in FAK+/+cells, which became more flattened and unable to move (data not shown), supporting an essential role of Rho-kinase in stress fiber formation and cell motility. For FAK−/− cells, Y27632 promptly altered their rounded morphology to a spread fibroblast-like shape in 30 min (Fig. 2A) and significantly enhanced their motility (Fig.3). Four hours after the removal of Y27632 from the medium, the cells became less spread and finally rounded (Fig. 2B) accompanied with the recovery of Rho-kinase activity (data not shown). Importantly, the spreading of FAK−/− cells induced by Y27632 was concomitant with marked reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton from cortical actin bundles into long parallel filaments similar to those seen in polar migratory fibroblasts (Fig. 2C). In addition, paxillin, a protein localized in focal adhesions, was found from peripheral patchlike to scattered dotlike distribution upon the addition of Y27632 (Fig. 2C). These results suggest that in FAK−/− cells, the constitutive activation of Rho-kinase may be involved in the formation of cortical actin structures, abundance of peripheral adhesions, and round cell shape.Figure 2The specific Rho-kinase inhibitor Y27632 induces FAK−/−cells to spread accompanied by reorganization of actin cytoskeleton and redistribution of focal adhesions.A, FAK−/− cells were sparsely grown on glass overnight and then treated with or without 10 μmY27632. 30 min later, micrographs were taken by a cooled CCD under a differential interference contrast (DIC) microscope.

Bar, 10 μm.C, FAK−/− cells were treated with or without 10 μm Y27632 for 30 min and then stained for actin with fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-phalloidin and for paxillin with monoclonal anti-paxillin.

An average migratory speed of 10 cells at the front was measured by Meta Imaging Series software, version 4.5. Values (mean ± S.E.) are from three independent experiments. Bar, 30 μm.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) It is worth noting that the Y27632-treated FAK−/− cells exhibited not only spread cell shape but also characteristics of motile cells including membrane ruffles and the formation of filopodia and lamellipodia (Figs. 2 and 3). To examine the effect of Y27632 on the motility of FAK−/− cells, wound healing assays were performed and monitored by time-lapse microscopy. We found that the motility of FAK−/− cells was indeed enhanced by Y27632 at 10 μm. Using an image analysis software, the motility of FAK−/− cells was measured at an average speed of 5 μm h−1 in the absence of Y27632 and an average speed of 20 μm h−1 in the presence of Y27632 (Fig. 3). These results suggest that constitutive activation of Rho-kinase may account for both morphological and migratory defects of FAK−/− cells. To further confirm this finding, an active truncated form of Rho-kinase with a deletion at its COOH terminus (25Poperechnaya A. Varlamova O. Lin P.-J. Stull J.T. Bresnick A.R. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 697-707Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 31Ishizaki T. Naito M. Fujisawa K. Maekawa M. Watanabe N. Saito Y. Narumiya S. FEBS Lett. 1997; 404: 118-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar) was transiently expressed in FAK+/+ cells. Within 6 h after transfection, the expression of the constitutively active Rho-kinase in FAK+/+ cells led to cell rounding and inhibition of movement (Fig. 4). However, prolonged expression (>12 h) of the constitutively active Rho-kinase in FAK+/+ cells led to membrane blebbing and apoptosis (data not shown) as shown in other cell types (32Coleman M.L. Sahai E.A. Yeo M. Bosch M. Dewar A. Olson M.F. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 339-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (985) Google Scholar, 33Sebbagh M. Renvoize C. Hamelin J. Riche N. Bertoglio J. Breard J. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 346-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (711) Google Scholar). Although the detailed mechanism by which constitutive activation of Rho-kinase induces prominent formation of cortical actin rings at the FAK−/− cell periphery is currently unknown, these cortical actin bundles may assemble with myosin II to generate a non-polar contractile force surrounding the cell, leading to a rounded cell shape and a deficiency in cell motility. Because the phosphorylation of regulatory light chain of myosin II was known to be critical for controlling actomyosin contractility in smooth muscle and nonmuscle cells (17Kamm K.E. Stull J.T. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1985; 25: 593-620Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we examined the subcellular localization of MLC and its Ser-19-phosphorylated form in both FAK+/+ cells and FAK−/− cells by immunofluorescence staining (Fig.5). Using a monoclonal antibody specific for Ser-19-phosphorylated MLC (27Komatsu S. Yano T. Shibata M. Tuft R.A. Ikebe M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 34512-34520Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), we were able to detect the active phosphorylated form of myosin II in these cells. In FAK+/+cells, MLC and phosphorylated MLC were organized into long parallel filaments with a similar distribution as actin stress fibers. In FAK−/− cells, they were mainly accumulated at the cell periphery, suggesting that active actomyosin structures are assembled at the FAK−/− cell periphery. To further examine the possibility that the actomyosin-driven contractility is responsible for round cell shape of FAK−/− cells, an inhibitor of myosin ATPase activity, 2,3-butanedione monoxime (BDM), was used to inhibit myosin-driven contractility. Indeed, BDM at 30 mm induced a morphological transition of FAK−/− cells from a round to a spread cell shape (Fig. 6A), supporting the idea that the myosin-driven contractility surrounding the FAK−/− cell is responsible for the round cell shape. However, it should be noted that although BDM-treated FAK−/− cells became spread, they did not exhibit characteristics of motile cells. Judging by time-lapse microscopy, these BDM-treated FAK−/− cells were unable to move and divide (data not shown). In addition, although BDM-treated FAK−/− cells retained their ability to form focal adhesions (indicated by paxillin localization), they had no stress fiber-like actin filaments in the center of the cells (Fig.6B).Figure 6Effect of BDM , an inhibitor of myosin contractility, on the morphology of FAK−/−cells.FAK−/− cells were treated with or without 30 mm BDM. 12 h later, the cells were visualized under a DIC microscope (A) and co-stained for actin and paxillin (B). Bar, 20 μm.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Rho-kinase and MLCK have been suggested to play distinct roles in spatial regulation of MLC phosphorylation (16Totsukawa G. Yamakita Y. Yamashiro S. Hartshorne D.J. Sasaki Y. Matsumura F. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 797-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (542) Google Scholar). To investigate which kinase is responsible for phosphorylating MLC at the FAK−/− cell periphery, the subcellular localizations of Rho-kinase and MLCK were examined. Unfortunately, because of the failure of the anti-Rho-kinase antibody in immunofluorescence staining, we were unable to determine the localization of Rho-kinase in these cells. However, the localization of MLCK in FAK−/− cells was unusual, which was strongly accumulated at the cell periphery instead of a diffuse distribution as seen in FAK+/+ cells (Fig. 7A). To further confirm this phenomenon, GFP-MLCK was transiently expressed in FAK+/+ and FAK−/− cells, and the fluorescence of GFP-MLCK was visualized in living cells (Fig. 7A). Similar to endogenous MLCK in FAK−/− cells, GFP-MLCK was mainly accumulated at the cell periphery. In FAK+/+ cells, GFP-MLCK distributed both at cell periphery and the center of the cell where it assembled into long filaments. The expression and activity of MLCK was next compared between FAK+/+ and FAK−/− cells (Fig. 7B). Surprisingly, the amount of MLCK in FAK−/− cells was ∼3-fold of that in FAK+/+ cells, which was approximately correlated with the difference in MLCK activity between these two cell lines. Thus, although we cannot exclude the role of Rho-kinase in MLC phosphorylation at the FAK−/− cell periphery, the peripheral localization and high expression of MLCK in these cells render it more likely to be involved in this event. MLCK has been reported to directly interact with actin filaments (34Lin P. Luby-Phelps K. Stull J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7412-7420Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). To examine whether the formation of the cortical actin cytoskeleton is required for peripheral accumulation of MLCK, FAK−/−cells were treated with 2.5 μm cytochalasin D for 1 h to disrupt actin cytoskeleton and then co-stained for actin and MLCK (Fig. 8A). In the control experiments, GFP-MLCK was expressed in FAK−/− cells, and its peripheral localization was visualized after treatment of 30 μg/ml nocodazole, which disrupts microtubules (Fig. 8B). Our results clearly demonstrated that the disruption of cortical actin cytoskeleton but not microtubule prevented the peripheral accumulation of MLCK in FAK−/− cells, suggesting that the formation of cortical actin bundles is essential for MLCK accumulation at the cell periphery. In addition to genetic approaches with dominant negative or positive mutants of Rho-kinase, a pharmacological approach using the Rho-kinase inhibitor Y27632 has frequently been used to examine the role of Rho-kinase in cellular functions.

https://openalex.org/W2051272652,"The insect spruce budworm (Choristoneura fumiferana)(Cf) produces a number of isoforms of its highly active antifreeze protein (CfAFP). Although most of the CfAFP isoforms are in the 9-kDa range, isoforms containing a 30- or 31-amino acid insertion have also been identified. Here we describe the functional and structural analysis of a selected long isoform, CfAFP-501. X-ray crystal structure determination reveals that the 31-amino acid insertion found in CfAFP-501 forms two additional loops within its highly regular β-helical structure. This effectively extends the area of the two-dimensional Thr array and ice-binding surface of the protein. The larger isoform has 3 times the thermal hysteresis activity of the 9-kDa CfAFP-337. As well, a deletion of the 31-amino acid insertion within CfAFP-501 to form CfAFP-501-Δ-2-loop, results in a protein with reduced activity similar to the shorter CfAFP isoforms. Thus, the enhanced antifreeze activity of CfAFP-501 is directly correlated to the length of its β-helical structure and hence the size of its ice-binding face.

These proteins bind to seed ice crystals and inhibit their growth through an adsorption-inhibition mechanism (1Raymond J.A. DeVries A.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 2589-2593Crossref PubMed Scopus (681) Google Scholar). The structures of these proteins have proven to be remarkably varied (2Jia Z. Davies P.L. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2002; 27: 101-106Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar), yet they perform the same freeze-protecting function. In all documented examples to date, an AFP-protected organism produces only one or two types of antifreeze, but they are typically comprised of multiple, independently active isoforms. The AFGP-producing fishes of the Arctic and Antarctic regions make a range of antifreeze glycoproteins (Mr ∼3,000–26,000) that differ mainly in the number of their glycotripeptide units (3DeVries A.L.

As well the ocean pout (Macrozoarces americanus) produces many isoforms of globular type III AFP (9Li X.M. Trinh K.Y. Hew C.L. Buettner B. Baenziger J. Davies P.L. J. Biol.

AFPs have been characterized in three insects, and each species contains multiple AFP isoforms. Thus far, eight Tenebrio molitor beetle AFP cDNAs have been identified coding for either 84, 96, or 120 amino acids (11Liou Y.C. Thibault P. Walker V.K. Davies P.L. Graham L.A. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 11415-11424Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), whereas 13 isoforms of the homologous pyrochroid beetle (Dendroides canadensis) AFP have been cloned (12Andorfer C.A. Duman J.G. J. Ins. Phys. 2000; 46: 365-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), again varying in size and sequence. Similarly, the insect spruce budworm (Choristoneura fumiferana (Cf)) contains isoforms of its potent antifreeze protein (13Doucet D. Tyshenko M.G. Kuiper M.J. Graether S.P. Sykes B.D. Daugulis A.J. Davies P.L. Walker V.K. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 6082-6088Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The isolation and sequencing of cDNA isoforms of C. fumiferana antifreeze proteins (CfAFPs) revealed the presence of several 9-kDa isoforms along with three isoforms containing an ∼30 amino acid insertion resulting in a 12-kDa protein (13Doucet D. Tyshenko M.G. Kuiper M.J. Graether S.P. Sykes B.D. Daugulis A.J. Davies P.L. Walker V.K. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 6082-6088Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Among various isoforms of CfAFP, one 9-kDa isoform has been characterized in great detail (namely 337 or CfAFP-337) and has been the focus of recombinant expression and structure determination by NMR and x-ray crystallography (14Gauthier S.Y. Kay C.M. Sykes B.D. Walker V.K. Davies P.L. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 258: 445-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 15Leinala E.K. Davies P.L. Jia Z.

Nature. 2000; 406: 325-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar). These investigations showed that CfAFP is a left-handed β-helix with a two-dimensional Thr array on one face of the protein that forms the ice-binding site. The antifreeze activity of another 9-kDa isoform (339) has also been assayed and found to be equivalent to that of isoform 337 (13Doucet D. Tyshenko M.G. Kuiper M.J. Graether S.P. Sykes B.D. Daugulis A.J. Davies P.L. Walker V.K. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 6082-6088Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The long isoform 501 of CfAFP is only 66% identical to the characterized 337 isoform. Using CfAFP-501 as a representative of the longer isoforms, we were interested in determining whether the 31-amino acid insertion correlates with higher activity and, if so, what is the molecular and structural basis for the enhancement. To this end, we have expressed and measured the activity of the protein and determined its x-ray crystallographic structure. In addition, deletion of the 31amino acid insertion (representing two turns of the β-helix) in a so-called “loopectomy” procedure has been carried out to further probe the activity-structure relationship. The cDNA of CfAFP-501 was cloned into the pET20(b) vector (Novagen) for recombinant expression inEscherichia coli. AFP expressed in BL21(DE3) cells was present in inclusion bodies requiring refolding performed in a manner similar to that of CfAFP-337 (14Gauthier S.Y. Kay C.M. Sykes B.D. Walker V.K. Davies P.L. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 258: 445-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Refolded protein was purified using fast protein liquid chromatography and high pressure liquid chromatography column chromatography as reported for CfAFP-337 (14Gauthier S.Y. Kay C.M. Sykes B.D. Walker V.K. Davies P.L. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 258: 445-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) with the exception that the majority of the CfAFP-501 protein eluted in a single, well folded peak from both the fast protein liquid chromatography and high pressure liquid chromatography columns without the splitting into incompletely folded and well folded peaks as seen with CfAFP-337. To excise the 31-amino acid insertion found in the long isoform CfAFP-501 and to produce CfAFP-501-Δ-2 loop, the pET20(b) vector containing the cDNA for CfAFP-501 was cleaved with the restriction enzyme ClaI whose natural cleavage sites were found on either side of the cDNA encoding the 31-amino acid segment. Religation of the remaining vector backbone and cDNA produced an expression vector for the CfAFP-501-Δ-2 loop. Protein was recombinantly produced using the cDNA containing pET20(b) vector in BL21(DE3) E. coli cells. Again, the protein was present in inclusion bodies, and the refolding, expression, and purification were performed as in the case of CfAFP-337 (14Gauthier S.Y. Kay C.M. Sykes B.D. Walker V.K. Davies P.L. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 258: 445-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) and CfAFP-501 described above. Crystals of CfAFP-501 were grown at room temperature using the hanging drop vapor diffusion method. The protein was crystallized using a solution of 18% polyethylene glycol-4000 and 20% isopropanol in sodium citrate buffer (100 mm, pH 4.8–5.6) producing thin plate-like crystals. These crystallization conditions are different in both temperature and solution components used for CfAFP-337. Due to structural microheterogeneity found in recombinantly produced CfAFP-337, higher temperatures were required to reduce this heterogeneity and produce crystals of CfAFP-337. 2Leinala, E. K., Davies, P. L., and Jia, Z. (2002) Acta Crystallogr. Biol. Crystallogr. Sect. D58,1081–1083 This conformational microheterogeneity is not seen in the preparation of CfAFP-501. Due to poor diffraction and high mosaicity of the thin crystals, diffraction quality of most crystals was unsatisfactory. After screening many CfAFP-501 crystals (between 50–75) under cryogenic conditions, a data set was eventually collected to a 2.45-Å resolution using a copper Rigaku rotating anode x-ray generator and a Mar Research imaging plate. The diffraction images were processed using the HKL program suite (18Otwinowski Z. Minor W.

The positions of four molecules in the asymmetric unit of the CfAFP-501 crystals were determined by molecular replacement using the program EPMR (version 3.1) (19Kissinger C.R. Gehlhaar D.K. Smith B.A. Bouzida D. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2001; 57: 1474-1479Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). A theoretical search model was used for molecular replacement and was composed of the crystal structure of CfAFP-337 (15Leinala E.K. Davies P.L. Jia Z. Structure. 2002; 10: 619-627Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar) (PDB code 1L0S) with two extra β-helical loops manually modeled into the structure using Sybyl (Tripos, St. Louis, MO) and Turbo-Frodo (20Jones T.A. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1978; 11: 268-272Crossref Google Scholar). These two loops were residues 29–59 of CfAFP-337 inserted between residues 28 and 29. Amino acids in the model were mutated in silico to those of CfAFP-501 without additional energy minimization. Structure refinement was performed using the CNS program package (21Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16979) Google Scholar) with gradual reduction of non-crystallographic symmetry restraints. Ribbon diagrams in figures were generated using MolScript (22Kraulis P.J. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1991; 24: 946-950Crossref Google Scholar). Measurement of AFP activity was performed according to a previously established routine process (23Chakrabartty A. Hew C.L. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 202: 1057-1063Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar) in the presence of 0.1 m ammonium bicarbonate employing a nanoliter osmometer (Clifton Technical Physics). CfAFP-501 retains the extremely regular left-handed β-helical structure seen with CfAFP-337 (15Leinala E.K. Davies P.L. Jia Z. Structure. 2002; 10: 619-627Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar) (Table I). The β-helix is formed by a series of 15-amino acid turns, which result in an elongated protein with a triangular cross-section (Fig.1). The 31-amino acid insertion found in the CfAFP-501 sequence forms two extra loops (16 + 15 amino acids) within the central region of the β-helix (Fig. 1), extending the length of the β-helical structure from 31 Å (in CfAFP-337) to 39.6 Å. Although each turn of the CfAFP β-helix is usually 15 amino acids in length, one of the additional loops in CfAFP-501 contains 16 residues. An extra Ser within this repeat unit is accommodated within a corner of the triangular β-helix, not within the putative ice-binding site, and is directed away from the core structure of the protein. Interior and exterior amino acid positions form stacks of similar residues that contribute to the rigidity of the β-helical structure. One side of the exterior of the protein features two stacks of Thr residues (Fig. 2A), while three interior stacks are composed of hydrophobic residues (Fig.2B). Interior corner residues are mainly Ser, Thr, and Cys residues producing a hydrogen-bonding network to form the sharp 60 ° interior turns or corners required for the formation of the triangular cross-section of the protein (Fig. 2C). By analogy with CfAFP-337, the side of CfAFP-501 containing the repetitive Thr-Xaa-Thr array forms the ice-binding face of the protein. On this face of CfAFP-501, Val residues replace Thr-5 and Thr-52, whereas Thr-37 is substituted with an Ile. These Val and Ile residues have side-chain χ1 torsion angles of 177 ° and −60 °, respectively, whereas the Thr side-chains are at a χ1 torsion angle of −60 °. In terms of the definition of χ1 torsion angles for Val, Ile, and Thr residues these values represent geometrically equivalent rotamers. The positioning of the side-chains places all the residues on this face of the protein in the same orientation arrangement enabling the continued formation of the regularly spaced ice-binding platform (Fig.3). As in CfAFP-337 (15Leinala E.K. Davies P.L. Jia Z. Structure. 2002; 10: 619-627Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar), this face forms an ice-binding site with extensive surface complementarity to ice, and the addition of two extra loops within CfAFP-501 increases the size of the interfacial surface between the AFP and ice by ∼34%. A theoretical model of CfAFP-501 was used in the molecular replacement stage of CfAFP-501 x-ray structure determination. Because CfAFPs have such a repetitive protein backbone this procedure is a very rational approach to structure determination. Although there has been some success in using theoretical models for molecular replacement, in most cases the probing models have been built from the combination of a number of core structures from homologous proteins, and these models were usually not larger than the starting templates. However, in this case a larger model had to be constructed instead of employing the usual approach of trimming the original structure. The theoretical model was based on the structure of CfAFP-337 (15Leinala E.K. Davies P.L. Jia Z. Structure. 2002; 10: 619-627Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar) with residues 29–59 repeated and incorporated between residues 28 and 29. The amino acid residues were changed to that of CfAFP-501 with no additional energy minimization. The actual resulting root mean square deviation value between the theoretical search model and the final structure of CfAFP-501 is 1.53 Å for all atoms and 0.63 Å for the backbone atoms, respectively. The latter value is also representative of the overall backbone structural similarity between CfAFP-501 and 337, even though the amino acid identity between them is only 66%. To assess the effect on antifreeze activity of the increased length of the β-helical structure and the greater overall area of the putative ice-binding face, thermal hysteresis measurements were taken. This assay evaluates the ability of the AFP to non-colligatively depress the freezing point of a solution by inhibiting the growth of a seed ice crystal. Activity was assayed over a range of concentrations from 0 to 1.2 mg/ml (0–0.1 mmol). CfAFP-501 was considerably more active than CfAFP-337 over all concentration ranges (Fig. 4) with thermal hysteresis values up to 3-fold higher. For example, at a concentration of 0.05 mm, CfAFP-337 has a thermal hysteresis value of 1.8 °C, whereas CfAFP-501 has an activity of 4.7 °C. To determine whether the increased antifreeze activity of CfAFP-501 was due to sequence differences between the two isoforms or due to the increased length of CfAFP-501, a shorter CfAFP-501 was recombinantly produced. This involved the deletion of a 31-amino acid segment from CfAFP-501 at the cDNA level to form the protein CfAFP-501-Δ-2 loop in which two loops of the β-helix were removed from the protein. Antifreeze activity measurements were performed on the shorter CfAFP-501-Δ-2 loop resulting in decreased thermal hysteresis values that are similar to those of the 9-kDa 337 isoform (Fig. 4). This result convincingly demonstrates that rather than its sequence differences, the increased size of CfAFP-501 is responsible for its greater activity. The results of this study suggest that the size of the ice-binding face of CfAFP is an important determinant of its antifreeze activity. These findings parallel those where a longer isoform of the α-helical fish type I AFP, containing four ice-binding repeats as compared with the usual three, was found to be a more potent antifreeze protein (24Chao H. Hodges R.S. Kay C.M. Gauthier S.Y. Davies P.L. Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 1150-1156Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The four-repeat protein had a freezing point depression of 1.0 °C at 10 mg/ml, whereas the three-repeat protein had a thermal hysteresis activity of 0.68 °C at the same concentration. Although in the case of type I AFP there has been no structure determined for the longer isoform, given the regular α-helical structure observed in shorter isoforms (25Sicheri F. Yang D.S. Nature. 1995; 375: 427-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar) it would not be surprising if the longer isoform displayed the same repetitive α-helical folding. By the same token, removal of two ice-binding repeats from the three-repeat isoform left a 15-amino acid peptide that had lost all its thermal hysteresis activity but retained the ability to shape the ice crystal (26Houston M.E., Jr. Chao H. Hodges R.S. Sykes B.D. Kay C.M. Sonnichsen F.D. Loewen M.C. Davies P.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11714-11718Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). An additional correlation between AFP length and activity has also been described for the AFGPs. Evaluation of the thermal hysteresis activity of various molecular weight isoforms of AFGPs determined that lower molecular weight, not amino acid composition, was responsible for the reduced activity of smaller AFGPs (27Schrag J.D. O'Grady S.M. DeVries A.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1982; 717: 322-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Given the predicted linear nature of these AFGPs (28Bush C.A. Feeney R.E. Osuga D.T. Ralapati S. Yeh Y. Int. J. Pept. Protein Res. 1981; 17: 125-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) the lower molecular weight isoforms are likely shorter, thereby linking AFGP length with activity. Our work suggests that the higher activity of CfAFP-501, as compared with the shorter CfAFP-337, is due to the length of the β-helical platform and consequently the increased ice-binding area. It also indicates that as long as the basic β-helical folding is maintained, a certain degree of sequence variation in the Thr-Xaa-Thr motif can be tolerated. A question that naturally arises from this study is what are the limits to the effective length of the AFP β-helical platform. Although it can be envisioned that there is definitely a limit that can be experimentally determined, as described below, it is important to note that such a limit comes with some structural reasoning. The overall stability of a “free-standing” α-helix or β-helix has to be maintained by the helix itself, which has no additional stabilization interaction with other parts of the overall structure as usually seen in many other proteins. As the length of the helix increases, the flexibility will naturally increase. Given the regularity of ice lattice, too much flexibility on the part of AFP might have detrimental effects on AFP-ice interaction. Therefore, the effective length will be a compromise or delicate balance between the ice-binding area and structural flexibility. To more directly map out the relationship between antifreeze activity and AFP length (ice-binding surface area) a series of AFPs of varying sizes must be examined. This could be done with the addition or deletion of more loops within CfAFP or could be more directly accomplished using the beetle TmAFP, which contains three different lengths of its natural isoforms. We thank Sherry Gauthier for technical assistance in the production of the shortened CfAFP-501."

https://openalex.org/W2050975040,"Dengue virus NS5 protein is a multifunctional RNA-dependent RNA polymerase that is essential for virus replication. We have shown previously that the 37- amino acid interdomain spacer sequence (residues369 X 2KKX 14KKKX 11RKX 3405) of Dengue2 NS5 contains a functional nuclear localization signal (NLS). In this study, β-galactosidase fusion proteins carrying point mutations of the positively charged residues or truncations of the interdomain linker region (residues 369–389 or residues 386–405) were analyzed for nuclear import and importin binding activities to show that the N-terminal part of the linker region (residues 369–389, a/bNLS) is critical for nuclear localization and is recognized with high affinity by the conventional NLS-binding importin α/β heterodimeric nuclear import receptor. We also show that the importin β-binding site (residues 320–368, bNLS) adjacent to the a/bNLS, previously identified by yeast two-hybrid analysis, is functional as an NLS, recognized with high affinity by importin β, and able to target β-galactosidase to the nucleus. Intriguingly, the bNLS is highly conserved among Dengue and related flaviviruses, implying a general role for the region and importin β in the infectious cycle. Dengue virus NS5 protein is a multifunctional RNA-dependent RNA polymerase that is essential for virus replication. We have shown previously that the 37- amino acid interdomain spacer sequence (residues369 X 2KKX 14KKKX 11RKX 3405) of Dengue2 NS5 contains a functional nuclear localization signal (NLS). In this study, β-galactosidase fusion proteins carrying point mutations of the positively charged residues or truncations of the interdomain linker region (residues 369–389 or residues 386–405) were analyzed for nuclear import and importin binding activities to show that the N-terminal part of the linker region (residues 369–389, a/bNLS) is critical for nuclear localization and is recognized with high affinity by the conventional NLS-binding importin α/β heterodimeric nuclear import receptor. We also show that the importin β-binding site (residues 320–368, bNLS) adjacent to the a/bNLS, previously identified by yeast two-hybrid analysis, is functional as an NLS, recognized with high affinity by importin β, and able to target β-galactosidase to the nucleus. Intriguingly, the bNLS is highly conserved among Dengue and related flaviviruses, implying a general role for the region and importin β in the infectious cycle. yellow fever virus nuclear localization signal β-galactosidase T-antigen glutathione S-transferase enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay confocal laser scanning microscopy yeast two-hybrid importin β binding Dengue virus is a member of the genus Flavivirus within the family Flaviviridae that also contains the generaPestivirus and Hepacivirus. There are around 70 viruses grouped in the Flavivirus genus, which includes yellow fever virus (YFV),1Japanese encephalitis virus, Murray Valley encephalitis virus, Kunjin virus, and tick-borne encephalitis virus. Dengue virus causes a benign syndrome known as Dengue fever and a more severe illness, Dengue hemorrhagic fever or in its severest form Dengue shock syndrome (1Halstead S.B.

There are four serologically and phylogenetically distinguishable Dengue viruses (types 1–4), and the disease they cause is of substantial world wide significance to human health but is mostly restricted to tropical and sub-tropical areas because of its transmission by the Aedes aegypti mosquito (4Monath T.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 2395-2400Crossref PubMed Scopus (643) Google Scholar). Flaviviruses possess a single-strand, positive-sense RNA genome of around 11 kb, which is capped but not polyadenylylated, and encodes a single polyprotein including three structural and seven non-structural proteins in the order C-prM-E-NS1-NS2A-NS3-NS2B-NS2A-NS4B-NS5 (5Rice C.M.

Whereas the protein and RNA interactions of the replicase complexes still require detailed characterization, several recent studies (7Kapoor M. Zhang L. Ramachandra M. Kusukawa J. Ebner K.E.

NS3 (69 kDa) is a multifunctional protein that has been shown to have protease, helicase, NTPase, and 5′-terminal RNA triphosphatase activities (16Li H. Clum S. You S. Ebner K.E. Padmanabhan R. J.

NS5 (104 kDa) contains a well characterized RNA-dependent RNA polymerase activity associated with the C-terminal domain (20Tan B.H., Fu, J. Sugrue R.J. Yap E.H. Chan Y.C. Tan Y.H.

Although there has been no function demonstrated for the N-terminal domain of NS5, it is predicted to be anS-adenosylmethionine transferase based on sequence comparison (25Koonin E.V. J. Gen. Virol. 1993; 74: 733-740Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). Whereas the primary replication activity involving Dengue NS5 occurs in the cytoplasm, a predominantly nuclear hyperphosphorylated form of NS5 has been reported in infected mammalian cells in the late stage of infection. The cytoplasmic form of NS5 is hypophosphorylated and able to interact with NS3, whereas the hyperphosphorylated form does not interact with NS3 (7Kapoor M. Zhang L. Ramachandra M. Kusukawa J.

Phosphorylation of flavivirus NS5/NS5A proteins occurs at serine/threonine residues (26Reed K.E. Gorbalenya A.E. Rice C.M. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 6199-6206Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 27Morozova O.V.

YFV NS5 is also phosphorylated and localized in the nucleus (28Buckley A. Gaidamovich S. Turchinskaya A. Gould E.A. J. Gen. Virol. 1992; 73: 1125-1130Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), whereas NS5 of other flaviviruses such as Japanese encephalitis virus and Kunjin virus have not been detected in the nucleus (8Edward Z.

Virology. 1997; 234: 31-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Transport to the nucleus of proteins that are larger than 45 kDa requires intrinsic targeting signals called nuclear localization sequences (NLSs) (30Jans D.A. Biochem.

There are two main classes of basic type NLSs as follows: the simian virus 40 (SV40) large tumor antigen (T-ag) monopartite NLS type, consisting of a single cluster of basic amino acids (PKKKRKV) (34Kalderon D. Richardson W.D. Markham A.F. Smith A.E. Nature. 1984; 311: 33-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (907) Google Scholar); and bipartite NLSs comprising two clusters of basic amino acids separated by a spacer of 10–12 amino acids (35Jans D.A. Chan C.K. Huebner S. Med. Res. Rev. 1998; 18: 189-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Both types of NLS are recognized by the conventional nuclear import receptor, the importin α/β heterodimer (36Imamoto N. Shimamoto T. Kose S. Takao T. Tachibana T. Matsubae M. Sekimoto T.

A number of proteins have been shown recently (40Truant R. Cullen B.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1210-1217Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 41Xiao Z. Liu X. Lodish H.F. J. Biol.

Commun. 2001; 282: 629-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) to be able to be imported into the nucleus through an analogous pathway involving direct interaction with importin β independent of importin α. A functional NLS within residues 369–405 of Dengue NS5, predicted to be an interdomain region of NS5 linking theS-adenosylmethionine transferase and polymerase domains (44Forwood J.K. Brooks A. Briggs L.J. Xiao C.Y. Jans D.A. Vasudevan S.G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 257: 731-737Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), has been identified and demonstrated to be functional. This region contains three basic clusters resembling NLSs that are separated by spacer regions of 14 and 11 amino acid residues and is recognized by importin a/b (44Forwood J.K. Brooks A. Briggs L.J. Xiao C.Y. Jans D.A. Vasudevan S.G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 257: 731-737Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). More recently we used the yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) system to show that the adjacent residues 320–368 interact with importin β. Interestingly, we also showed that this same region also binds NS3 at either an identical or overlapping sequence (45Johansson M. Brooks A.J. Jans D.A. Vasudevan S.G. J. Gen. Virol. 2001; 82: 735-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). In order to determine the functional significance of these sequences in the vicinity of the interdomain region of NS5, we set out to use site-directed mutagenesis and deletion analysis to define the essential elements of the importin a/b- and β-binding sites in NS5 nuclear localization for the first time. We show that nuclear targeting conferred by NS5-(369–405) is predominantly through residues 369–389 (the “a/bNLS”), which is recognized by importina/b, and that the bNLS (residues 320–368) is able to direct β-gal to the nucleus of mammalian cells. Interestingly, the NS5-(369–405) region inhibits the ability of bNLS to transport β-gal to the nucleus and also prevents the binding of importin β to the bNLS, whereas the bNLS inhibits the importina/b-binding and nuclear targeting abilities of the a/bNLS. This suggests that there may be important functional significance for the physical proximity of the a/b- and bNLSs in regulating the nuclear entry of NS5 during the late stage of Dengue infection, with the homology of these sequences comparable to gene products from a range of flaviviruses, implying wider importance. Cells of the HTC rat hepatoma tissue culture line (a derivative of Morris hepatoma 7288C) were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. For in vitro nuclear transport assays cells were grown on glass coverslips for 2 days and then washed in intracellular buffer (110 mm KCl, 5 mmNaHCO3, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 0.1 mm CaCl2, 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 1 μm dithiothreitol, 10 ng/ml leupeptin) just prior to mechanical perforation (46Jans D.A.

Den2 NS5 NLS β-gal fusion constructs shown in Fig. 1were constructed from plasmid pPR2-NS5-NLS (referred to as pPR2Nco-NS5CcN in Ref. 44Forwood J.K. Brooks A. Briggs L.J. Xiao C.Y. Jans D.A.

Prior to making the constructs shown in Fig. 1, plasmid pPR2-NS5-NLS was first subjected to partial BamHI digestion followed by treatment with T4 DNA polymerase (Promega) in order to delete the BamHI site downstream of thelacZ gene. The new plasmid pPR2-1B-NS5-NLS facilitated the cloning of relevant NS5 fragments into the unique BamHI site at the 5′ end of lacZ to make the various fusion protein-expressing plasmid constructs used in this study. Gene fragments were generated by standard PCR procedures usingTaq polymerase (Promega), appropriate primers, and template. The NLS mutants and the a/bNLS were obtained by PCR utilizing pPR2-1B-NS5-NLS as a template and the combinations of the desired mutagenic primers, general primers, or primer for NS5-(386–405) (see Table I), except for the mutant KN123 which used a previously created mutant template pPR2-1B-NS5-NLSKN2 and the two mutagenic primers to give the remaining mutations.

The beads were washed 5 times with the pull-down buffer, and proteins were eluted with 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.0, containing 60 mm reduced glutathione and 100 mm NaCl. The eluted fractions were separated on 10% SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose membrane, detected with mouse polyclonal NS5 antibody (45Johansson M. Brooks A.J. Jans D.A. Vasudevan S.G. J. Gen. Virol. 2001; 82: 735-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar), and visualized with ECL (AmershamBiosciences AB). The crystal structure of the complex of importin β with the importin β binding (IBB) region of importin α (Protein Data Bank code 1QGK) was used to mutate the amino acid region 13–20 of importin α to the corresponding amino acids 353–360 of Den2 NS5 (see Fig. 6), and the packing of all mutated residues was assessed using the crystallography software package O (59Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard Acta Crystallogr Sect. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13006) Google Scholar). The potential collision between the side-chains of F17E and importin β Trp-342 was manually adjusted, and the model was refined by molecular dynamic energy minimization using crystallography NMR software (60Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr Sect. D Biol.

The root mean square deviations Cα atoms between the new model and the crystal structure is only 0.84 6Å, although the Cα of residues 15–18 moved around 1.1 to 1.7 Å. A new hydrogen bond (3.1 Å) was formed between E17 OE1 and Val-350 N. We have previously localized a functional importin a/b-recognized NLS to the 37-amino acid interdomain region (residues 369–405) of Dengue 2 NS5 (44Forwood J.K. Brooks A. Briggs L.J. Xiao C.Y. Jans D.A. Vasudevan S.G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 257: 731-737Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) and more recently shown that the N-terminally adjacent residues (320–368) interact with both importin β and the viral helicase NS3 (45Johansson M. Brooks A.J. Jans D.A. Vasudevan S.G. J. Gen. Virol. 2001; 82: 735-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Residues 369–405 include three clusters of basic amino acid residues that resemble either three monopartite or two bipartite NLSs where the middle cluster of three positively charged lysine residues may be shared with either the N-terminal or C-terminal cluster. To test which of these residues are critical for NLS function, the lysine residues at positions 371 and 372 (KN1), 388 and 389 (KN2), and arginine at position 401 and lysine 402 (KN3) were altered by site-directed mutagenesis to asparagine separately or in combination (KN123, where all six positions were changed) as indicated (see Fig.1). The encoded NS5-NLS-β-gal fusion proteins were overexpressed, purified, and fluorescently labeled (see “Materials and Methods”) and then added to mechanically perforated HTC cells together with an ATP-regenerating system and exogenous cytosol to assess nuclear import kinetics using CLSM. Fig.2 shows that NS5 amino acids 369–405 targeted β-gal to the nucleus maximally to levels about 2-fold those in the cytoplasm (Fn/c max = 1.9) (44Forwood J.K. Brooks A. Briggs L.J. Xiao C.Y. Jans D.A. Vasudevan S.G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 257: 731-737Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). β-Gal itself was excluded from the nucleus (Fn/c max of 0.5, see Table II). Examination of KN1, KN2, KN3, and KN123 (Fig. 2 B,i) indicated that both the Fn/c max and t 12(the time at which half-maximal nuclear accumulation is achieved) values were altered (Table II). The mutations in KN3 had the least effect compared with wild-type, whereas the nuclear import data for KN2 indicated an Fn/c max of around 1.0. More drastic reductions in Fn/c max were evident for KN1 and KN123, where the level of nuclear accumulation was not significantly above that of β-gal alone (Table II). Taken together, this suggests that the charged clusters KN1 and KN2 represent critical elements of the NLS.Table IIIn vitro nuclear import kinetics of NS5 peptide-β-galactosidase fusion proteinsNS5-β-Gal fusionFn/c maxt 12NS5-(369–405)-β-Gal1.90 ± 0.262.22 ± 0.56NS5-(369–405)-KN1-β-Gal0.60 ± 0.14ND2-aND, not able to be determined due to low import.NS5-(369–405)-KN2-β-Gal1.09 ± 0.235.40 ± 0.34NS5-(369–405)-KN3-β-Gal1.48 ± 0.064.94 ± 0.27NS5-(369–405)-KN123-β-Gal0.75 ± 0.072.78 ± 1.15NS5-(a/bNLS)-β-Gal1.68 ± 0.252.67 ± 0.87NS5-(386–405)-β-Gal1.13 ± 0.33NDβ-Gal0.48NDNS5-(320–405)-β-Gal1.13 ± 0.073.79 ± 1.28NS5-(bNLS)-β-Gal2.00 ± 0.309.70 ± 1.62NS5-(341–405)-β-Gal0.92 ± 0.277.02 ± 0.86From experimental data such as that presented in Fig. 2 B, curves were fitted for the function Fn/c(t) = Fn/c max(1 − e −kt), wheret is time in minutes; Fn/c max is the maximal level of n"

Endotoxin treatment of rats and interleukin-1β (IL-1β) treatment of liver-derived HepG2 cells leads to a marked decline in the nuclear binding activity of a main Ntcp gene regulator, the nuclear receptor heterodimer retinoid X receptor:retinoic acid receptor (RXR:RAR).

IL-1β treatment of cultured primary rat hepatocytes markedly reducedNtcp RNA levels and Ntcp promoter activity in transiently transfected HepG2 cells. Pretreatment with inhibitors of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK, PD98059) or p38 MAPK (SB203580) did not affect IL-1β-mediated suppression ofNtcp gene expression, whereas curcumin, a derivative of the spice turmeric and a recently described inhibitor of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), completely ameliorated the effects of IL-1β. Co-transfection of a JNK expression plasmid inhibited RXR:RAR-mediated activation of the Ntcp promoter, while a dominant negative JNK expression plasmid completely blocked IL-1β-mediated suppression. Curcumin, but not PD98059 or SB203580, inhibited IL-1β-mediated suppression of nuclear RXR:RAR binding activity, which correlated with inhibition of JNK phosphorylation and phospho-JNK-mediated phosphorylation of RXR.

Little is known of the underlying cellular and molecular mechanisms, but several groups have focused their efforts by trying to link transporter gene down-regulation to the various arms of the intracellular signaling mechanisms invoked during the hepatic response to inflammation (the acute phase response). The expression and function of hepatic bile acid transporters have been studied in a variety of experimental inflammatory conditions, with the main emphasis on alterations in bile acid uptake and Ntcpgene regulation (reviewed in Ref. 8Karpen S.J. Matern Hepatobiliary Transport: From Bench to Bedside. Kluwer Academic, London2001: 22-31Google Scholar). The hepatocyte responds to inflammation and cholestasis by a variety of self-protective adaptations, including reduction in the sinusoidal uptake of bile acids. We and others (1Kim P.K. Chen J.

This inflammation-induced repression of Ntcp gene expression is due to reduced nuclear concentrations of keyNtcp promoter transcriptional activators, primarily hepatocyte nuclear factor 1 (HNF1) and the nuclear receptor heterodimer retinoid X receptor:retinoic acid receptor (RXR:RAR)1 (4Trauner M. Arrese M. Lee H. Boyer J.L. Karpen S.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 2092-2100Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar, 9Denson L.A. Auld K.L. Schiek D.S. McClure M.H. Mangelsdorf D.J. Karpen S.J. J. of Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8835-8843Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). In human hepatoblastoma-derived HepG2 cells, interleukin-1β (IL-1β) down-regulates Ntcp promoter activity by reducing RXR:RAR function and DNA binding activity (9Denson L.A. Auld K.L. Schiek D.S. McClure M.H. Mangelsdorf D.J. Karpen S.J. J. of Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8835-8843Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Moreover, we have recently shown that bile acids also down-regulate the Ntcp promoter via repression of RXR:RAR function by the bile acid-induced expression of the transcriptional repressor small heterodimer partner (SHP, NR0B2) (10Denson L.A. Sturm E. Echevarria W. Zimmerman T.L. Makishima M. Mangelsdorf D.J. Karpen S.J. Gastroenterology. 2001; 121: 140-147Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). Together, these findings support the concept that RXR:RAR is a central mediator of Ntcp gene activity and that both cholestatic and cytokine-activated pathways regulate Ntcpgene expression via distinct, and likely additive, suppression of RXR:RAR function. Whether or not there is a direct link between cytokine- and bile acid-regulated pathways in liver is controversial and currently under investigation. Gupta et al. (11Gupta S. Stravitz R.T. Dent P. Hylemon P.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 15816-15822Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar) provide support for bile acid activation of the SHP promoter via a mechanism that involves a central player in the response to inflammation, c-Jun N-terminal kinase, JNK. However, a role for SHP in the endotoxin-mediated down-regulation of the Ntcp gene is not supported by a recent publication of Zollner et al. (12Zollner G. Fickert P. Silbert D. Fuchsbichler A. Stumptner C. Zatloukal K. Denk H. Trauner M. Am. J. Physiol. Gastrointest. Liver Physiol. 2002; 282: G184-G191Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), whereNtcp expression was clearly reduced in response to both bile acid feeding and bile duct ligation (conditions that lead to increased SHP expression), whereas endotoxin administration reducedNtcp RNA levels without enhancing SHP RNA expression. Thus, the role of SHP in mediating inflammation-mediated down-regulation of the Ntcp gene is unclear. In this report, we present evidence that IL-1β-mediated Ntcp promoter down-regulation does not necessarily require SHP; rather, IL-1β treatment leads to JNK-dependent repression of RXR:RAR nuclear binding activity with consequent suppression of RXR:RAR-mediated transcription. Moreover, we employ curcumin, a component of the spice turmeric, as a JNK inhibitor that completely abrogates Ntcp gene promoter suppression by IL-1β (13Chen Y.R. Tan T.H. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 173-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar). These studies provide support for a novel and potentially widely targeted pathway of gene regulation in liver—direct JNK-dependent phosphorylation of RXR. IL-1β was purchased from R&D Systems Inc.

Five million hepatocytes purified through a Percoll gradient were plated onto 10-cm diameter Primaria tissue culture dishes (BD PharMingen) in Williams E medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 10 mg/liter insulin-transferrin-sodium selenite (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), 400 μg/liter dexamethasone, 4 μg/liter glucagon and 100,000 units/liter penicillin, 100 mg/liter streptomycin, 50 mg/liter gentamicin, 250 μg/liter amphotericin B, 292 mg/literl-glutamine for 4 h. Hepatocytes were washed twice with warm phosphate-buffered saline and maintained in serum-free media (containing IL-1β or saline control ± inhibitors) for the duration of the experiment. Human hepatoblastoma-derived HepG2 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and antibiotics according to published methods (17Karpen S.J. Kudish B. Mazhar S. Suchy F.J. Gastroenterology. 1996; 110: A1229Google Scholar). Four hours after plating, primary rat hepatocytes in serum-free medium were exposed to inhibitors (25 μm curcumin, 20 μm PD98059, 25 μm SB203580) or equal volume of Me2SO vehicle) 30 min prior to the addition of 1 ng/ml IL-1β (or control saline) for a total treatment time of 16 h. HepG2 cells were subjected to treatments with either 1 ng/ml IL-1β or water control for time periods varying from 5 min to 16 h before harvest. Transfections of HepG2 cells using the FuGENE transfection reagent (Hoffmann-LaRoche, Inc., Nutley, NJ) proceeded according to the manufacturer's instructions. Typically, 0.8 μg of luciferase reporter, 0.1 μg of pRSVβGal, and 0.1 μg of either control vector (pCMV), or JNK1 or dnJNK1 expression plasmids were added to individual wells of a 6-well plate. The transfection solution was removed after 12 h. Plates were washed with warm phosphate-buffered saline and then subjected to treatments. After treatment, cells were washed, and extracts were prepared for luciferase and β-galactosidase assays with reporter lysis buffer (Promega Corp., Madison, WI) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Luciferase activity was determined via an Ascent microplate luminometer (Thermo Labsystems, Helsinki, Finland) and normalized to β-galactosidase activity as previously described (14Karpen S.J.

Each transfection experiment was performed in triplicate, repeated 3–6 times, and validated using at least 2 different plasmid preparations. Total RNA was extracted from plated primary rat hepatocytes by guanidium thiocyanate extraction with subsequent centrifugation in cesium chloride solution (10Denson L.A. Sturm E. Echevarria W.

RNA quantitation was performed with a PhosphorImager (Amersham Biosciences). Crude nuclear extract was prepared from treated HepG2 cells according to published methods (18Hoppe-Seyler F. Butz K. Rittmuller C. von Knebel Doeberitz M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 5080Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were determined using the Bradford reagent kit (Bio-Rad). Double-stranded wt rat Ntcp RXR:RAR DR2 element (nucleotide −53/−40) was end-labeled, purified, and incubated with 10 μg of HepG2 nuclear extracts for 30 min as described (4Trauner M. Arrese M. Lee H. Boyer J.L. Karpen S.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 2092-2100Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). After binding, each reaction was electrophoresed through a non-denaturing 5% polyacrylamide gel, dried, and exposed to BioMax film for varying time periods. The canonical AP-1 element-containing oligonucleotide 5′-CGCTTGATGACTCAG-3′ was tested in a similar fashion. Total cell extracts were obtained by homogenizing in 0.25 ml of buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.5 m NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 2 mmEGTA, 1.0% Triton X-100, 0.25% deoxycholate, 1.0 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mg/ml pepstatin, 1.0 mg/ml leupeptin, 1.0 mg/ml aprotinin, 1.0 mm NaF, 1.0 mmNa3VO4), and protein levels were determined by the BCA protein assay method according to the manufacturer's instructions (Pierce). Protein samples were resolved by 10% SDS-PAGE and transferred to Trans-Blot transfer membrane (Bio-Rad) at 250 mA for 75 min. Membranes were blocked (1 h at room temperature) in 5% nonfat dry milk dissolved in TBST (Tris-buffered saline Tween) prior to incubation with antibodies specific for phospho-JNK or JNK (both 1:2000; Cell Signaling Technology, Beverly, MA) for 16 h at 4 °C. Antibodies were diluted in 5% bovine serum albumin in TBST. Membranes were subsequently washed three times with TBST and incubated with secondary antibody (anti-rabbit goat IgG linked with horseradish peroxidase, 1:2000 in 5% milk in TBST) for 1 h at room temperature. After washing in TBST three times, blots were incubated with ECL reagents for 1 min according to the manufacturer's instructions (Western lighting chemiluminescent reagent plus, PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Glutathione S-transferase (GST)-tagged RXR constructs were expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) and purified using glutathione-Sepharose beads according to the manufacturer's recommendations (Amersham Biosciences) (19Lee H.Y.

Briefly, HepG2 cells were grown to confluency, placed in serum-free media for 48 h, and treated for the indicated time periods with 1 ng/ml IL-1β, ± inhibitors curcumin, PD98059, or SB203580 or vehicle Me2SO. Cells were lysed and JNK immunoprecipitated from 100 μg of cell extracts with antibodies (1 μg) that recognize JNK (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA). Protein A-G agarose beads (20 μl) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) were added and incubated at 4 °C for 1 h. Beads were washed three times with lysis buffer and once with kinase buffer (20 mmHepes, pH 7.5, 20 mm β-glycerol phosphate, 10 mm pNPP, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 50 mm sodium vanadate). Kinase assays were performed by incubating the beads with 30 μl of kinase buffer to which 20 mm cold ATP, 5 μCi of [γ32P]ATP (2000 cpm/pmol), and 2 μg of GST-RXR were added. The kinase reaction was performed at 30 °C for 20 min. The samples were suspended in Laemmli buffer, boiled for 5 min, and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. The gel was dried and autoradiographed. We first sought to determine whether IL-1β treatment of primary rat hepatocyte cultures leads to reductions inNtcp RNA levels and whether known inhibitors of IL-1β signaling affect the response of hepatocytes to IL-1β (Fig.1A). Treatment with 1 ng/ml of IL-1β for 16 h reduced Ntcp RNA levels by 70% compared with saline control, thereby reproducing the known in vivo effects of endotoxin and cytokines (3Green R.M. Beier D. Gollan J.L. Gastroenterology. 1996; 111: 193-198Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar, 4Trauner M. Arrese M. Lee H. Boyer J.L. Karpen S.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 2092-2100Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). IL-1β regulates the activity of a variety of target genes and transcription factors through several signal transduction cascades, including the three main mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK), which are JNK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), and p38 MAPK (21Saklatvala J. Dean J. Finch A. Biochem. Soc. Symp. 1999; 64: 63-77PubMed Google Scholar, 22Moshage H. J. Pathol. 1997; 181: 257-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (554) Google Scholar). To investigate which pathway or pathways were primarily involved, primary rat hepatocytes were preincubated with known inhibitors of these three signaling pathways immediately prior to exposure to IL-1β (Fig.1A). Preincubation with a known ERK (20 μmPD98059) or p38 MAPK (25 μm SB203580) inhibitor had no significant effect on IL-1β-mediated down-regulation ofNtcp RNA levels, whereas curcumin, a recently described JNK inhibitor, completely blocked the effects of IL-1β(13). We have recently shown (9Denson L.A. Auld K.L. Schiek D.S. McClure M.H. Mangelsdorf D.J. Karpen S.J. J. of Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8835-8843Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar) that IL-1β treatment of HepG2 cells inhibits rat Ntcp promoter activity through reduction in the nuclear binding activity of the trans-acting nuclear receptor heterodimer, RXR:RAR. In order to explore the molecular mechanisms underlying IL-1β-mediated suppression of Ntcp promoter activity, it was first necessary to determine whether the response to the three inhibitors employed in IL-1β-treated primary rat hepatocyte experiments was replicated in transiently transfected HepG2 cells. As previously reported (9Denson L.A. Auld K.L. Schiek D.S. McClure M.H. Mangelsdorf D.J. Karpen S.J. J. of Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8835-8843Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar), treatment of HepG2 cells transiently transfected with wt −158/+47 Ntcp promoter-luciferase constructs with IL-1β resulted in suppression of reporter activity by ≈ 50% (Fig. 1B). Pretreatment with the JNK inhibitor, curcumin, completely blocked IL-1β-mediated repression ofNtcp promoter activity, whereas treatment with either the ERK (PD98059) or the p38 MAPK (SB203580) inhibitors had no discernible effect. These data validate the use of transiently transfected HepG2 cells as a model of curcumin inhibition of the effects of IL-1β onNtcp gene expression. One of the principal mechanisms of action attributed to the effects of curcumin on inflammation-based signal transduction is via inhibition of JNK (23Chen Y.R. Wang W. Kong A.N. Tan T.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1769-1775Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). Although it is clear from previous work that an intact DR2 RXR:RAR binding element in theNtcp promoter is required for IL-1β repression, a role for JNK in regulating Ntcp promoter expression is unknown (9Denson L.A. Auld K.L. Schiek D.S. McClure M.H. Mangelsdorf D.J. Karpen S.J. J. of Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8835-8843Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). In order to support a role for JNK in IL-1β-mediated suppression of RXR:RAR transactivation of the Ntcp promoter, it was necessary to determine whether 1) JNK can directly suppress RXR:RAR-dependent activation of the Ntcppromoter, 2) the effects of IL-1β can be blocked by interfering with JNK signaling by co-transfecting a plasmid expressing a dominant negative version of JNK (dnJNK), and 3) RXR:RAR binding to the DR2 element in the Ntcp promoter is necessary for the effects of IL-1β and JNK. As seen in Fig.2A, IL-1β suppresses expression of the wt Ntcp promoter but not one where the RXR:RAR binding site (DR2 element) is functionally mutated (FM1). Co-transfection of a plasmid expressing an active form of JNK1 (JNK) significantly suppresses Ntcp promoter activity, with further suppression in the presence of IL-1β. Notably, co-transfection of the dnJNK plasmid completely abrogates the effects of IL-1β. The expression of the mutant Ntcppromoter plasmid FM1 was less than that of the wt Ntcppromoter-luciferase plasmid (as previously reported) and was insensitive to the effects of IL-1β and co-transfected plasmids JNK and dnJNK. Thus both IL-1β- and JNK-mediated down-regulation of the Ntcp promoter requires an intact DR2 element, and co-transfection of a dnJNK plasmid completely interferes with IL-1β suppression of the Ntcp promoter. The data in Fig. 2A show that mutation of the DR2 element completely eliminated the effects of IL-1β as well as co-transfected JNK and dnJNK plasmids on Ntcp promoter expression, which could reflect effects on neighboring Ntcp transcriptional regulators and not RXR:RAR directly. In Fig. 2B, we explore these effects on isolated wt and FM1 elements driving the expression of the heterologous TK promoter. IL-1β and JNK directly suppress wt, but not mutant, Ntcp DR2 element activity, whereas co-transfection of dnJNK abolishes IL-1β suppression of wt, but not mutant, DR2-driven TK activity. Together, these findings support the integral role of RXR:RAR on baseline Ntcp promoter activity and specify the RXR:RAR DR2 binding element as the target of the effects of IL-1β acting through a JNK-dependent signaling pathway. Nuclear binding activity of RXR:RAR is significantly reduced in livers of rats treated with endotoxin or IL-1β-treated HepG2 cells, yet the molecular mechanisms are unknown (4Trauner M. Arrese M. Lee H. Boyer J.L. Karpen S.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 2092-2100Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar, 9Denson L.A. Auld K.L. Schiek D.S. McClure M.H. Mangelsdorf D.J. Karpen S.J. J. of Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8835-8843Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). HepG2 cells were pretreated with the three MAPK signal pathway inhibitors (curcumin, PD98059, or SB203580) 30 min prior to IL-1β or saline control, and crude nuclear extracts were analyzed for RXR:RAR binding activity via electrophoretic mobility shift assay. As shown in Fig.3A, IL-1β-mediated suppression of RXR:RAR DNA binding activity was completely abrogated by pretreatment with curcumin but not with PD98059 or SB203580. Moreover, as a marker of JNK activation, these same nuclear extracts were studied for content of the Activator Protein 1 (AP-1), a known target of IL-1β and JNK signaling in liver and HepG2 cells (24Mendelson K.G. Contois L.R. Tevosian S.G. Davis R.J. Paulson K.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 12908-12913Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar, 25Minet E. Michel G. Mottet D. Piret J.P. Barbieux A. Raes M. Michiels C. Exp. Cell Res. 2001; 265: 114-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). IL-1β treatment led to robust activation of AP-1 signals, which was blocked by curcumin but not by PD98059 or SB203580. Thus, curcumin prevents the IL-1β-mediated repression of RXR:RAR binding activity as well as the activation of AP-1, consistent with interfering with JNK-dependent signaling. Total cellular RXR levels were unchanged by IL-1β or any of the three pretreatments (data not shown). We have recently shown (19Lee H.Y. Suh Y.A. Robinson M.J. Clifford J.L. Hong W.K. Woodgett J.R. Cobb M.H. Mangelsdorf D.J. Kurie J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 32193-32199Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) in COS7 fibroblasts that activation of stress-activated pathways, including activation of JNK, leads to RXR phosphorylation and reduced retinoid activation of an RXR:RAR target plasmid. Whether or not these pathways apply in IL-1β-treated HepG2 cells is not known. If curcumin works via the blockade of IL-1β activation of JNK, then curcumin should inhibit the phosphorylation of JNK induced by IL-1β-dependent signaling. Because the peak of IL-1β-mediated activation of JNK, ERK, and p38 MAPK in HepG2 cells occurs at 15–30 min after treatment, lysates were made after 30 min of pretreatment with inhibitors (or Me2SO control) followed by 30 min of treatment with IL-1β (see Fig.4A and Ref. 26Kumar A.

However, human trials with vitamin E have been disappointing, perhaps related to ineffective levels of vitamin E in atherogenic apoB-containing lipoproteins. Phospholipid transfer protein (PLTP) promotes vitamin E removal from atherogenic lipoproteins in vitro, and PLTP deficiency has recently been recognized as an anti-atherogenic state. To determine whether PLTP regulates lipoprotein vitamin E contentin vivo, we measured α-tocopherol content and oxidation parameters of lipoproteins from PLTP-deficient mice in wild type, apoE-deficient, low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor-deficient, or apoB/cholesteryl ester transfer protein transgenic backgrounds. In all four backgrounds, the vitamin E content of very low density lipoprotein (VLDL) and/or LDL was significantly increased in PLTP-deficient mice, compared with controls with normal plasma PLTP activity. Moreover, PLTP deficiency produced a dramatic delay in generation of conjugated dienes in oxidized apoB-containing lipoproteins as well as markedly lower titers of plasma IgG autoantibodies to oxidized LDL. The addition of purified PLTP to deficient plasma lowered the vitamin E content of VLDL plus LDL and normalized the generation of conjugated dienes. The data show that PLTP regulates the bioavailability of vitamin E in atherogenic lipoproteins and suggest a novel strategy for achieving more effective concentrations of anti-oxidants in lipoproteins, independent of dietary supplementation.

Trends Cardiovasc. Med. 2001; 11: 93-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar). However, a direct relationship between the susceptibility of LDL1 to oxidation and the extent of atherosclerosis has not been found in all studies, and attempts to prevent atherogenesis by feeding diets enriched in “natural” anti-oxidants have provided mixed and sometimes disappointing results (2Heinecke J.W.

Recently, it was shown that feeding large doses of vitamin E to apoE-deficient mice decreased the progression of atherosclerosis (4Pratico D. Tangirala R.K. Rader D.J. Rokach J. Fitzgerald G.A. Nat.

An important issue that has not been addressed in such studies is the actual concentrations of vitamin E in atherogenic lipoproteins. Recently, mice with α-tocopherol transfer protein deficiency were shown to have reduced vitamin E content in lipoproteins, and moderately increased susceptibility to atherosclerosis (13Terasawa Y. Ladha Z. Leonard S.W. Morrow J.D. Newland D. Sanan D. Packer L. Traber M.G. Farese Jr., R.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 13830-13834Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). However, little is known of the physiological mechanism regulating the turnover and levels of vitamin E in the plasma lipoproteins. The plasma phospholipid transfer protein (PLTP) mediates both net transfer and exchange of phospholipids between lipoproteins (14Tall A.R. Krumholz S. Olivecrona T. Deckelbaum R.J. J. Lipid Res. 1985; 26: 842-851Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). PLTP can also bind and transfer several other amphipathic lipids, including unesterified cholesterol, diacylglycerides, and lipopolysaccharides (15Lagrost L. Desrumaux C. Masson D. Deckert V. Gambert P. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 1998; 9: 203-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). PLTP has been shown in vitro to facilitate the transfer of vitamin E from VLDL to HDL (16Kostner G.M.

FASEB J. 1999; 13: 883-892Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), but it is not known if PLTP regulates vitamin E levels in lipoproteins or tissues in vivo. PLTP knock-out (PLTP0) mice were recently shown to be resistant to atherosclerosis, in part related to decreased secretion and levels of apoB containing lipoproteins (18Jiang X.C. Qin S. Qiao C. Kawano K. Lin M. Skold A. Xiao X. Tall A.R. Nat. Med. 2001; 7: 847-852Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). The decreased secretion and levels of apoB lipoproteins was demonstrated by crossing the PLTP deficiency trait into apoE-deficient and apoB transgenic backgrounds. However, an anti-atherogenic effect of PLTP deficiency was also seen in LDL receptor knock-out mice, even though plasma levels of apoB lipoproteins were identical to controls. This indicates an additional anti-atherogenic mechanism of PLTP deficiency. In this study we have investigated the hypothesis that PLTP has a physiological role in transferring vitamin E between lipoproteins: this hypothesis predicts an increased content of vitamin E in apoB-containing lipoproteins in PLTP-deficient mice, and a decreased susceptibility to oxidation. Such findings would provide a plausible novel anti-atherogenic mechanism related to PLTP deficiency, beyond the effects of lowering BLp levels (18Jiang X.C. Qin S. Qiao C. Kawano K. Lin M. Skold A.

ApoE0 mice were fed a chow diet; LDLR0 and apoBTg/CETPTg mice were fed a Western-type diet containing 20% hydrogenated coconut oil and 0.5% cholesterol. These diets were not supplemented with vitamin E. Total cholesterol, phospholipids, and triglycerides were assayed by using commercially available enzymatic kits, i.e. CHOD-PAD (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), PAP 150 (BioMérieux), and Triglyceride (Roche Diagnostic Systems-Hoffman-La Roche) kits, respectively. Total lipid was calculated as the sum of cholesterol, phospholipids, and triglycerides. Proteins were measured using bicinchoninic acid reagent (Protein Assay Reagent, Pierce). d < 1.006, 1.006 < d < 1.063, and 1.063 < d < 1.210 fractions were isolated from 400-μl fasting plasma samples by sequential ultracentrifugation. The d < 1.006 fraction contained the triglyceride-rich lipoproteins (mainly VLDL); the 1.006 < d < 1.063 fraction contained mainly LDL; and the 1.063 < d < 1.210 fraction contained HDL (27Segrest J.P. Albers J.J. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 128: 78-129Google Scholar). Lipophilic compounds were extracted from lipoprotein fractions by an ethanol/hexane solution (1:3, v/v), as previously described (28Jezequel-Cuer M., Le Moël G. Mounie J. Peynet J., Le Bizec C. Vernet M.H. Artur Y. Laschi-Loquerie A. Troupel S. Ann. Biol. Clin. 1995; 53: 343-352PubMed Google Scholar). The hexane fraction was evaporated under nitrogen, and it was finally recovered in methanol-acetonitrile-chloroform solution (25:60:15, v/v). α-Tocopherol was assayed by high-performance liquid chromatography (29Miller K.W. Yang C.S. Anal. Biochem. 1985; 145: 21-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar) on a Beckman Gold system equipped with a Brownlee Spheri-5 RP 18 column that was connected to a diode array detector (model 168, Beckman). α-Tocopherol acetate was added to each sample as an internal standard before the extraction. Mice were anesthetized with intraperitoneal sodium pentobarbital injection, and the thoracic and abdominal aorta was rapidly removed and transferred into a saline solution. After the loose connective tissue was carefully removed, arteries were homogenized in a micropotter with 500 μl of saline containing 50 mm ascorbic acid, and 500 μl of an ethanolic solution containing 50 mg/liter butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT). The extraction procedure was conducted as previously described (30Katsanidis E. Addis P.B. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1999; 27: 1137-1140Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Briefly, 1 ml of ethanol and 300 μl of 10m KOH were added, and saponification was conducted at 80 °C for 30 min with intermittent shaking. The saponified solution was cooled down on ice water, and it was mixed with 4 ml of hexane, 2 ml of distilled water, and 10 μl of a 100 μg/ml ethanolic solution containing tocopheryl acetate (Fluka 95250) as an internal standard. The mixture was shaken vigorously for 1 min, and the upper layer was collected after low speed centrifugation and evaporated. The extract was finally dissolved in 100 μl of methanol containing 5 mm ammonium acetate. α-Tocopherol was analyzed by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry on a Nucleosil C18/5 μm, 2.0- × 250-mm column (Macherey-Nagel, Düren, Germany) using 5 mm ammonium acetate in CH3OH as the eluant at a flow rate of 0.4 ml/min. Positive ion electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry was performed on an MSD 1100 mass spectrometer (Agilent Technology, Waldbronn, Germany). The voltages of the aperture and capillar were set up at 80 and 3500 V, respectively, and the flow rate of the drying gas was 8 liters/min. Ions at m/z 431 and 490 were used to measure α-tocopherol and tocopherol acetate, respectively. α-Tocopherol level was determined by comparison with a standard curve that was obtained with known amounts of α-tocopherol (Fluka 89550). LDL from LDLR0/PLTP0, LDLR0, apoBTg/CETPTg/PLTP0, and apoBTg/CETPTg mice were isolated by a two-step procedure: the Ultracentrifuge-isolated 1.006 <d < 1.063 plasma fraction was passed through a Superose 6 column on an FPLC system (31Jiang X.C. Bruce C. Mar J. Lin M., Ji, Y. Francone O.L. Tall A.R. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 103: 907-914Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar), and 1-ml fractions containing only LDL were pooled. In the case of apoE0/PLTP0 and apoE0 mice, we used total apoB-containing particles that were Ultracentrifuge-isolated from total plasma as the d < 1.063 fraction. Isolated lipoproteins were oxidized at 37 °C in the presence of either copper sulfate (5 μm) or 2′-azobis(2-amidinopropane)hydrochloride (AAPH, Wako Pure Chemical Industries), and the formation of conjugated dienes was monitored at 234 nm over a 20-h period. Autoantibody titers to epitopes of oxidized LDL were measured as described previously (32Tsimikas S. Palinski W. Witztum J.L. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2001; 21: 95-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Diluted plasma samples were added to microtiter wells coated with either malondialdehyde-modified LDL (MDA-LDL) or copper-oxidized LDL. Bound autoantibodies were then detected with either anti-mouse IgG or anti-mouse IgM antibodies coupled to alkaline phosphatase. Bound antibodies were finally detected in the presence of a chemiluminescent substrate, and results were expressed in relative light units per 100 ms (32Tsimikas S. Palinski W. Witztum J.L. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2001; 21: 95-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). PLTP was partially purified from fresh human plasma. All purifications steps were performed on an FPLC system (AmershamBiosciences) according to the sequential procedure previously described (33Lagrost L. Athias A. Gambert P. Lallemant C. J. Lipid Res. 1994; 35: 825-835Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, the d > 1.21 g/ml plasma fraction was isolated by a 48-h, 45,000 rpm ultracentrifugation step performed in a 50-Ti rotor. The resulting infranatant was fractionated successively by hydrophobic interaction chromatography on a Phenyl-Sepharose CL-4B column (Amersham Biosciences) and by affinity chromatography on an Heparin-agarose column (Amersham Biosciences), yielding ∼1000-fold purification of PLTP as compared with the plasmad > 1.21 g/ml fraction (33Lagrost L. Athias A. Gambert P. Lallemant C. J. Lipid Res. 1994; 35: 825-835Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In chow-fed mice in the C57Bl6 background, PLTP deficiency resulted in the redistribution of α-tocopherol among the plasma lipoproteins (Fig. 1). Although plasma levels of α-tocopherol did not differ significantly between PLTP0 and control mice (0.18 ± 0.01 versus0.24 ± 0.02 mg/liter, respectively, NS), the α-tocopherol content of HDL was significantly reduced, and the α-tocopherol content of LDL was significantly increased in PLTP-deficient animals (Fig. 1, top panel). A 2-fold increase in the α-tocopherol to lipid ratio was observed in LDL from PLTP0 mice compared with wild type controls (Fig. 1, bottom panel), whereas no significant change was observed in the α-tocopherol to lipid ratio in HDL, reflecting the reduced levels of HDL in PLTP0 mice. The level of vitamin E was decreased in aorta, with α-tocopherol to artery weight ratios that were significantly lower in PLTP0 mice than in control mice of both sexes (Fig. 2). These findings show an essential role of PLTP in determining vitamin E levels in lipoproteins and vascular tissues. They are consistent with the hypothesis that PLTP transfers vitamin E from apoB-containing lipoproteins (BLps) into HDL, and from lipoproteins into tissues (16Kostner G.M. Oettl K. Jauhiainen M.

Thoracic and abdominal aorta were obtained from n = 30 PLTP0 mice (15 females; 15 males), and n = 30 control mice (15 females; 15 males). After the loose connective tissue was carefully removed, α-tocopherol was extracted from the vascular tissue and quantitated by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (see “Materials and Methods”). Data are mean ± S.E. of either five (male or females) or ten (all) distinct determinations; each determination was conducted by pooling arterial trees from three distinct mice.

Qin S. Qiao C. Kawano K. Lin M. Skold A. Xiao X. Tall A.R. Nat. Med. 2001; 7: 847-852Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar), we further investigated the effects of the PLTP deficiency trait on plasma α-tocopherol levels and lipoprotein distribution in hyperlipidemic plasmas of LDLR0, apoE0, and apoB/CETPTg backgrounds. Total plasma α-tocopherol levels were significantly higher in LDLR0/PLTP0 mice compared with LDLR0 mice (6.7 ± 0.9versus 4.7 ± 0.7 mg/liter, respectively, p < 0.005). Moreover, lipoprotein analysis showed that concentrations of α-tocopherol were significantly increased in both VLDL and LDL but unchanged in HDL (Fig.3). The increase in vitamin E in VLDL and LDL was demonstrated both as a plasma concentration and as a ratio to total lipids. Total α-tocopherol was dramatically increased in plasma of apoE0/PLTP0 mice compared with apoE0 mice (2.5 ± 0.4 versus 0.9 ± 0.2 mg/liter, respectively, p < 0.05), and there was a 5-fold increase in the α-tocopherol to lipid ratio in the VLDL fraction, the major atherogenic lipoprotein in these animals (Fig. 3). Even though the increase in plasma α-tocopherol did not reach statistical significance in apoBTg/CETPTg/PLTP0 mice compared with apoBTg/CETPTg mice (15.5 ± 1.6 versus 11.5 ± 2.4 mg/liter, NS), significant increases in the vitamin E content of the atherogenic lipoproteins (VLDL and LDL) were observed (Fig. 3). This result suggests that CETP, although related to PLTP, does not substitute in transferring vitamin E out of apoB-containing lipoproteins (34Granot E. Tamir I. Deckelbaum R.J. Lipids. 1988; 23: 17-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). These studies show a major role of PLTP in determining the concentration of vitamin E in atherogenic lipoproteins. To establish whether the increased vitamin E content of atherogenic lipoproteins from PLTP-deficient animals rendered them less susceptible to oxidation, we isolated the VLDL plus LDL fraction and measured the generation of conjugated dienes in the presence of either copper sulfate (Fig.4, a, c, and d) or AAPH (Fig. 4b). The formation of conjugated dienes, monitored at 234 nm over a 20-h period, was remarkably delayed by PLTP deficiency in all genetic backgrounds (Fig. 4), and similar observations were made when lipoproteins were oxidized with either copper or AAPH (Fig. 4, a and b). The lag phase of conjugated diene formation in LDL particles was 45 + 15 minversus 150 + 30 min (LDLR0 and LDLR0/PLTP0 mice, respectively), 30 + 15 min versus 75 + 15 min (apoBTg/CETPTg and apoBTg/CETPTg/PLTP0 mice), and 45 + 15 min versus 180 + 30 min (VLDL+LDL particles from apoE0 and apoE0/PLTP0 mice). The differences were all highly significant (p < 0.001). To confirm a direct role of PLTP in determining the distribution of α-tocopherol and the oxidizability of apoB-containing lipoproteins, plasma from LDLR0 or LDLR0/PLTP0 mice was incubated for 2 h at 37 °C in the presence or absence of purified exogenous PLTP. As observed previously, the oxidation susceptibility of LDL isolated from LDLR0/PLTP0 mice was markedly reduced compared with LDL from LDLR0 mice (Fig. 5). This difference was reversed by the addition of PLTP to the LDLR0/PLTP0 plasma. In parallel, the α-tocopherol content of the VLDL+LDL fraction from LDLR0/PLTP0 plasma was significantly reduced in the presence of PLTP, to levels similar to those observed in plasma from LDLR0 mice expressing normal levels of PLTP (Table I). Lag phase and α-tocopherol values did not vary significantly when LDLR0 samples were supplemented with PLTP, indicating that α-tocopherol was already equilibrated among the lipoproteins in mice expressing PLTP. The reversal of the abnormalities of vitamin E content and oxidizability of apoB-containing lipoproteins when PLTP-deficient plasmas were supplemented with purified PLTP proves that the observed effects (Figs. 3 and 4) are a direct consequence of PLTP action in plasma.Table IEffect of purified PLTP on the vitamin E content of apoB-containing lipoproteins (i.e. VLDL+ LDL) from PLTP0 miceMiceTreatmentα-Tocopherolμg/mlLDLR0No addition5.92 ± 0.10LDLR0+PLTP6.70 ± 0.35LDLR0/PLTP0No addition9.27 ± 0.661-aSignificantly different from LDLR0, no addition, LDLR0, +PLTP, and LDLR0/PLTP0, +PLTP;p < 0.01 in all cases by analysis of variance.LDLR0/PLTP0+PLTP6.48 ± 0.111-a Significantly different from LDLR0, no addition, LDLR0, +PLTP, and LDLR0/PLTP0, +PLTP;p < 0.01 in all cases by analysis of variance.

To determine if the increased vitamin E content of apoB-containing lipoproteins in PLTP-deficient animals might be associated with decreased oxidation of LDL in vivo, we measured the titer of IgG and IgM autoantibodies against MDA-LDL and copper-oxidized LDL (Cu-LDL). In each of the three hyperlipidemic backgrounds, PLTP deficiency was accompanied by a significant reduction (50–81%) in the titer of IgG autoantibodies, using either MDA-LDL or Cu-LDL as model epitopes of oxidized LDL (Fig. 6). Such a drop in the autoantibody titer in PLTP0 animals was not systematically observed with the IgM isotype. Indeed, although the IgM titer was significantly reduced in apoE0/PLTP0 mice, titers were increased or unchanged in LDLR0 and apoBTg/CETPTg backgrounds (Fig. 6). We have previously shown that PLTP deficiency provides protection against atherosclerosis in apoE0 and apoBTg/CETPTg mice, due in part to decreased hepatic production of apoB and decreased plasma levels of atherogenic lipoproteins (18Jiang X.C. Qin S. Qiao C. Kawano K. Lin M. Skold A. Xiao X. Tall A.R. Nat. Med. 2001; 7: 847-852Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). However, PLTP deficiency also conferred protection in LDLR0 mice even though apoB levels were not decreased, suggesting that PLTP deficiency had other anti-atherogenic properties. The present study demonstrates a novel in vivo role of PLTP in determining the concentration of vitamin E in BLps and suggests that increased vitamin E in BLps represents an additional mechanism by which PLTP deficiency protects against atherosclerosis in mice. PLTP deficiency led to an increased concentration of vitamin E in VLDL and/or LDL, and the magnitude of the effect on the vitamin E to lipid ratio varied from an increase of 70% in LDLR0 mice to 500% in apoE0 mice. In normolipidemic mice there was also a decrease in vitamin E content in HDL and aorta. These results are consistent with a physiological role of PLTP in transferring vitamin E from VLDL to HDL and then into tissues. The accumulation of vitamin E in BLps in PLTP-deficient mice was the most consistent and dramatic effect, and it was associated with a marked reduction in susceptibility of these particles to oxidative modification. This provides a cogent explanation for the previously observed anti-atherogenic effect of PLTP deficiency in LDL receptor KO mice, in which there was no change in BLp levels. Although the magnitude of the effect of vitamin E accumulation on atherogenesis appears to be only moderate (5Thomas S.R. Leichtweis S.B. Pettersson K. Croft K.D. Mori T.A. Brown A.J. Stocker R. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2001; 21: 585-593Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 6Stephens N.G. Parsons A. Schofield P.M. Kelly F. Cheeseman K. Mitchinson M.J. Lancet. 1996; 347: 781-786Abstract PubMed Scopus (1671) Google Scholar), our findings illustrate the important principle that the concentration of anti-oxidants in the relevant BLps is determined by factors acting beyond the dietary intake. In addition to the reduced secretion of BLps, they identify an additional anti-atherogenic mechanism that can be anticipated from PLTP inhibition and further support the idea that PLTP inhibitors or combined PLTP/CETP inhibitors may have a role as anti-atherogenic drugs (18Jiang X.C.

The role of different genes in the absorption, transport, and tissue uptake of dietary α-tocopherol (the ingested form of vitamin E with the greatest biological activity) has been elucidated by various genetic deficiency states. Thus, intestinal BLp assembly is essential for vitamin E absorption, as patients with abetalipoproteinemia become deficient in vitamin E (40Trabe"

However, the antiviral agent ganciclovir (GCV) has not been shown to be a substrate of MRP4. GCV is important not only in antiviral therapy, but also in the selective killing of tumor cells modified to express herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase (HSV-TK). We therefore tested the effect of MRP4 on the cytotoxicity of GCV, on the ability of GCV to kill cells genetically modified to express HSV-TK, and on the bystander effect in which unmodified target cells are killed by GCV. Cells overexpressing MRP4 had markedly increased resistance to the cytotoxicity of GCV. Although, expression of recombinant HSV-TK increased the intracellular concentration of GCV nucleotide, cells were rescued by the cytoprotective effect of MRP4. In cells that overexpressed MRP4, intracellular accumulation of GCV metabolites was reduced, efflux of these metabolites was increased, and resistance to bystander killing was increased. Therefore, MRP4 can strongly reduce the susceptibility of HSV-TK-expressing cells to GCV, and its overexpression in adjacent cells protects them from bystander cell death. These findings indicate that a nucleotide transporter, such as MRP4, modulates the cellular response to GCV and thus may influence not only the efficacy of antiviral therapy, but also prodrug-based gene therapy, which is critically dependent upon bystander cell killing.

Although the molecular basis of this interaction is unknown, in vitrostudies indicate that the combination is extremely cytotoxic (8Prichard M.N. Prichard L.E. Baguley W.A. Nassiri M.R.

If so, such an interaction could have important therapeutic potential because of the widespread use of GCV as a prodrug in gene therapies for cancer (10Freeman S.M. Whartenby K.A. Freeman J.L.

HSV-TK specifically converts GCV to its monophosphate nucleotide form, GCV-monophosphate, which is then further anabolized by cellular kinases, and accumulation of these metabolites causes cell death (5Martin J.C.

Med. 1996; 335: 721-729Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar). However, the cytotoxicity of this therapy varies dramatically. The mechanism of this variability is unknown, but it does not appear to reflect the level of HSV-TK expression (13Beck C. Cayeux S. Lupton S.D. Dorken B. Blankenstein T. Hum. Gene Ther. 1995; 6: 1525-1530Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 14Yang L. Hwang R. Chiang Y. Gordon E.M. Anderson W.F. Parekh D. Clin. Cancer Res. 1998; 4: 731-741PubMed Google Scholar). The variable toxicity of GCV to HSV-TK gene-modified tumor cells also markedly affects the efficacy with which bystander (adjacent, non-transduced) tumor cells are killed (15Culver K.W. Ram Z. Wallbridge S. Ishii H. Oldfield E.H. Blaese R.M. Science. 1992; 256: 1550-1552Crossref PubMed Scopus (1453) Google Scholar). In vitrostudies show that bystander cell death is associated with the accumulation of GCV metabolites (16Halloran P.J. Fenton R.G. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 3855-3865PubMed Google Scholar); however, this effect is variable and idiosyncratic, and the mechanism accounting for variable accumulation of these metabolites is unclear (17Boucher P.D.

Some investigators believe that direct intercellular communication by gap junctions is a prerequisite for GCV metabolite transfer (18Mesnil M. Yamasaki H. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 3989-3999PubMed Google Scholar), while others do not (19Bai S., Du, L. Liu W. Whittle I.R. He L. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Cancer Gene Ther. 2000; 7: 1456-1468Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Other studies suggest that diffusion of GCV metabolites and the proximity of bystander cells are important variables (21Bi W.L. Parysek L.M. Warnick R. Stambrook P.J. Hum.

Although a combination of these mechanisms is likely, it is unknown if nucleotide efflux plays a role. We reasoned that because the efflux transporter MRP4 transports some natural and modified nucleotides (2Schuetz J.D. Connelly M.C. Sun D. Paibir S.G. Flynn P.M. Srinivas R.V. Kumar A. Fridland A.

However, it is unknown if MRP4 plays a role in GCV metabolite accumulation and cellular egress. We investigated whether MRP4 affects the cellular accumulation and cytotoxicity of GCV in cells specifically overexpressing MRP4 and in cells we engineered to overexpress MRP4. The cDNA encoding human MRP4 was isolated and stably introduced into MCF-7 cells that expressed negligible immunoreactive MRP4. These cells had enhanced resistance to GCV cytotoxicity and to bystander cell killing. We also investigated the effect of MRP4 on the cytotoxicity of GCV in cells engineered to express HSV-TK. Taken together, our results show that MRP4 plays a key role in the intracellular accumulation and cytotoxicity of GCV metabolites. These findings reveal ganciclovir egress by MRP4 as a novel mechanism contributing to the variable response in gene therapy based on HSV-TK expression.

After exposure to GCV, cells were harvested, washed, and resuspended at ∼1 × 106 cells/ml in propidium iodide staining solution (0.05 mg/ml propidium iodide, 0.1% sodium citrate, 0.1% Triton X-100). Immediately before analysis, cells were treated for 30 min at room temperature with RNase (Calbiochem, San Diego, CA) at a final concentration of 14 μg/ml and filtered through nylon mesh. Fluorescence was measured on a Becton Dickinson FACScan flow cytometer (BD Biosciences) using laser excitation at 488 nm. The percentages of cells in different phases of the cell cycle were determined by using the Modfit computer program (Verify Software House, Topsham, ME). Analysis of the DNA content less than G1 was used as an additional measurement of apoptosis as previously reported (31Sampath J. Sun D. Kidd V.J. Grenet J. Gandhi A. Shapiro L.H. Wang Q. Zambetti G.P. Schuetz J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 39359-39367Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Briefly, after drug treatment both floating and attached cells were harvested in a propidium iodide solution (50 μg/ml propidium iodide in 0.1% sodium citrate and 0.1% Triton X-100), treated with 5 μg/ml RNase (Calbiochem) for 30 min at room temperature, and then analyzed by flow cytometry on a Becton Dickinson FACscan (BD Biosciences) using laser excitation at 488 nm. The percentage of sub-G1 cells was determined. CEMss and CEMr1 cell lines expressing TK were plated (5 × 104 cells/well) in 8-well plastic chamber slides (Lab-Tek) and treated with the indicated concentrations of GCV. The cells were then washed with phosphate-buffered saline, stained in 1 μg/ml DAPI, and examined on a Zeiss fluorescent microscope at 40× magnification (28Drake R.R. Wilbert T.N. Hinds T.A. Gilbert K.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37186-37192Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Cells (2 × 105 cells/ml growth medium) were seeded in 6-cm dishes 24 h prior to the assay. They were then washed with Hanks' balanced salt solution and incubated for the desired interval with the radiolabeled drug dissolved in warmed medium. Aliquots of cells were removed, washed with chilled phosphate-buffered saline, solubilized in 1 ml of 0.5 n NaOH, and assayed for radioactivity. The human MRP4 cDNA (expressed sequence tag 38,091, described in Ref. 2Schuetz J.D. Connelly M.C. Sun D. Paibir S.G. Flynn P.M. Srinivas R.V. Kumar A. Fridland A. Nat. Med. 1999; 5: 1048-1051Crossref PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar) was used to screen a human lung λ ZAPII cDNA library (Stratagene) by plaque hybridization. A 4.5-kb cDNA that lacked the initiator methionine was identified, and a 5′ portion of this cDNA was used to screen a human lung 5′-STRETCH PLUS cDNA library (Clontech). Ten positive clones that contained only the 5′ portion of MRP4 were isolated. The 5′ portion of MRP4, together with the overlapping 4.5-kb clone of the 3′ portion, yielded a 5.8-kb MRP4 cDNA (GenBankTM accession number: AY081219). The 5′- and 3′-untranslated regions of this cDNA fragment were removed, and the complete 4.2-kb cDNA encoding the 1325 amino acids of MRP4 was used to construct the expression vector MSCV-MRP4-IRES-GFP (contains the murine stem cell virus (MSCV) long terminal repeat as well as a ribosomal entry site (IRES) to permit expression of green fluorescent protein (GFP) and was kindly provided by Dr. Robert Hawley, Holland Laboratory, American Red Cross, Rockville, MD). The complete MRP4 cDNA was also subcloned into the EcoRI site of pcDNA3 (Invitrogen) to generate pcDNA3-MRP4. HEK293T cells were transfected with pEQ-PAM2(-E) and pvSVG expression vectors containing MSCV-IRES-GFP or MRP4-IRES-GFP constructs by calcium phosphate precipitation (29Lecureur V. Sun D. Hargrove P. Schuetz E.G. Kim R.B. Lan L.B. Schuetz J.D. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 57: 24-35PubMed Google Scholar), and supernatants containing retroviral particles were used to transfect the MCF7 cell line. GFP+ cells were identified by FACS. SAOS-2 cells transfected by calcium phosphate precipitation with either pcDNA3 or pcDNA3-MRP4 were selected in G418 (1000 μg/ml). CEMss HSV-TK and CEMr1-HSV-TK cells were treated in triplicate with 1 μC of [3H]GCV (plus 1 μm unlabeled GCV), washed, and resuspended in fresh medium. Nucleotides were extracted from pelleted cells in 0.2 ml of 7% methanol at 4 °C for 15 min (22Samejima Y. Meruelo D. Gene Ther. 1995; 2: 50-58PubMed Google Scholar). Radioactivity was measured in an aliquot of each methanol supernatant by scintillation counting. The proportion of phosphorylated GCV was measured in an aliquot of medium by anion exchange chromatography (22Samejima Y. Meruelo D. Gene Ther. 1995; 2: 50-58PubMed Google Scholar). The HSV-TK expressing SW620-TK cells were plated with acceptor cells that did not express HSV-TK (total, 2 × 105/well) in the following proportions: (acceptor:HSV-TK cells) 100:0%, 75:25%, 50:50%, and 0:100%. After 2 days, 10 μm GCV was added in 1 ml of fresh medium. After incubation for 24 h, medium was removed, cells were trypsinized, and each well was diluted 1:10 to 1:10,000 with fresh medium. After 7 days, surviving cell colonies were fixed in methanol, stained, and counted (27Drake R.R. Pitlyk K. McMasters R.A. Mercer K.E. Young H. Moyer M.P. Mol. Ther. 2000; 2: 515-523Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Immunoblot analysis showed the PMEA-resistant cell line, CEMr1 (4Gallant J.E. Moore R.D. Chaisson R.E. Ann. Intern. Med. 1994; 120: 932-944Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar), expressed 6- to 8-fold more MRP4 and slightly less MRP1 than did the CEMss parent cell line (Fig1 A). Treatment with GCV caused an indistinguishable cell cycle arrest in both CEMr1 and CEMss cells,i.e. the proportion of S-phase cells increased and the G1-phase decreased (Fig. 1 B). However, the viability of GCV-treated CEMss cells decreased in a dose-dependent manner, whereas the viability of CEMr1 cells was only modestly affected by GCV (Fig. 1 C); this finding was confirmed by measuring the population of cells with DNA content less than G1 indicative of apoptotic cells (31Sampath J. Sun D. Kidd V.J. Grenet J. Gandhi A. Shapiro L.H. Wang Q. Zambetti G.P. Schuetz J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 39359-39367Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar) (Fig.1 D). CEMr1 and CEMss cells were equally sensitive to vinblastine and, as expected, retained their respective resistance and sensitivity to PMEA (Fig. 1 E) (4Gallant J.E. Moore R.D. Chaisson R.E. Ann. Intern. Med. 1994; 120: 932-944Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). These results indicate that cells overexpressing MRP4 are sensitive to cell cycle arrest induced by GCV but are substantially more resistant to its cytotoxic effects. Sensitivity to GCV can be enhanced by modifying targeted cells to express HSV-TK, but identically modified cells vary markedly in their sensitivity to GCV (13Beck C. Cayeux S. Lupton S.D. Dorken B. Blankenstein T. Hum. Gene Ther. 1995; 6: 1525-1530Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). To evaluate whether MRP4 modulates the GCV sensitivity, we modified CEMss and CEMr1 cells to stably express HSV-TK, isolated cells that expressed similar levels of HSV-TK (Fig 2 B), and treated them with GCV. Although expression of HSV-TK increased the sensitivity of both sets of cells to GCV, their relative sensitivity was preserved (Fig 2 A). The IC50 of GCV was 60 μm in the CEMr1-TK cells, a value five times that in the CEMss-TK cells (12 μm). Thus, MRP4 overexpression strongly influences sensitivity to GCV in cells that are and are not modified to express HSV-TK. We compared efflux of GCV and its metabolites from CEMss-HSV-TK and CEMr1-HSV-TK cells by pretreating the cells with GCV, suspending them in drug-free medium for 4 h, and quantifying GCV and phosphorylated GCV in the medium by anion exchange chromatography (27Drake R.R. Pitlyk K. McMasters R.A. Mercer K.E. Young H. Moyer M.P. Mol. Ther. 2000; 2: 515-523Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Sixty-one percent of GCV metabolites in the CEMr1-HSV-TK cells and 44% in the CEMss-HSV-TK cells were released (Fig. 2 C). Thirty percent more of the GCV metabolites exported by CEMr1-HSV-TK cells than by the CEMss-HSV-TK cells were phosphorylated. These findings indicate that cells that overexpress MRP4 readily remove GCV metabolites. The initial uptake of GCV (0–5 min after exposure) was very rapid and was essentially identical in CEMss and CEMr1 cells (not shown). However, marked differences in GCV accumulation were observed after 60 min or more. CEMr1 cells accumulated substantially less drug than CEMss cells at every GCV concentration tested (Fig.2 D). Treatment with indomethacin, an inhibitor of MRP4 transport (see below), dramatically increased GCV accumulation in the CEMr1 cells (and to a lesser extent in the CEMss cells; Fig.2 D) and decreased their efflux of radiolabeled GCV nucleotides into the media to the level observed in CEMss cells (not shown). A cDNA encoding human MRP4 was isolated from two independent human lung cDNA libraries (see “Materials and Methods”). Its coding sequence was identical to the reported sequence (GenBankTM/EBI accession number AF071202) with the exception of seven single-base substitutions. Of these, only four caused amino acid changes. These differences may reflect polymorphisms or may be related to derivation of the reported MRP4 cDNA from a drug-selected cell line; drug selection has been noted to cause such alterations in other mammalian ABC transporters (e.g. MDR1 and BCRP). These differences clearly do not affect the transport of PMEA (see Fig.3 B). The human breast carcinoma cell line, MCF-7, was shown by Western blotting to express very low levels of MRP4. We transduced MCF-7 cells with either the MSCV-MRP4-IRES-GFP or the control MSCV-IRES-GFP and isolated GFP+ cell populations. We then quantified MRP4 in crude membrane fractions from each cell population by Western blotting (Fig. 3 A). As expected, MRP4 was highly expressed in cells transduced with MSCV-MRP4-IRES-GFP, whereas it was expressed at very low levels in cells transduced with MSCV-IRES-GFP. However, treatment of plasma membrane fractions with PNGase F to de-glycosylate MRP4 yielded a band of ∼150 kDa (a value close to that predicted from the amino acid sequence) in both cell lines, which suggests that posttranslational modifications may affect detection of MRP4 with this antibody. Immunohistochemical and subcellular fractionation studies revealed that most of the MRP4 expression in MCF-7 cells was localized to the plasma membrane (not shown). Uptake of PMEA, an acyclic nucleoside phosphonate that contains a nonhydrolyzable bond and resembles a nucleoside 5′-monophosphate (4Gallant J.E. Moore R.D. Chaisson R.E. Ann. Intern. Med. 1994; 120: 932-944Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar), was decreased in cells transfected with MRP4. However, because PMEA uptake is slow, we also incubated cells with bis-POM-PMEA, which is taken up and is converted to PMEA intracellularly before efflux (4Gallant J.E. Moore R.D. Chaisson R.E. Ann. Intern. Med. 1994; 120: 932-944Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Fig. 3 B shows that uptake of bis-POM PMEA by MCF-7-MRP4 cells was less than one-third of the uptake by control cells at every concentration tested. In contrast, vinblastine uptake was identical in test and control cells (Fig. 3 C). Interestingly, whereas earlier studies suggested that MRP4 plays a role in MTX uptake and efflux (3Lee K. Klein-Szanto A.J. Kruh G.D. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 2000; 92: 1934-1940Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar), we found that the steady-state intracellular concentration of methotrexate was the same in test and control cells (Fig.3 D). We next compared MRP4 function with the quantity of MRP4 protein expressed. Saos-2 human osteosarcoma cells, which express very little MRP4, were transfected with pcDNA3-MRP4 and selected in G418. Immunoblot analysis revealed a wide range of MRP4 expression (Fig.3 E). Although there appeared to be an inverse relationship between expression of MRP4 and expression of MRP1 in CEMss cells (Fig.1 A), MRP1 and MRP4 expression were completely unrelated in Saos-2 transfectants (Fig. 3 E). Intracellular accumulation of PMEA was inversely proportional to the quantity of MRP4 expressed: accumulation of PMEA was decreased (∼41%) at low levels of MRP4 expression and substantially (more than 95%) reduced at very high levels of MRP4 expression (Fig. 3 F). Accumulation of PMEA in the Saos-2 MRP4 transfectants was increased over 600% by treatment with 100 μm indomethacin (Fig. 3 G). In contrast, 100 μm probenecid treatment had no effect (Fig.3 G). Indomethacin-treated Saos-2 control cells also showed a modest increase (56%) in PMEA accumulation, possibly reflecting inhibition of an endogenous transporter. We observed no difference between control and MRP4-transfected MCF-7 cells in the initial rates of uptake (<5 min) of GCV, gemcitabine (a cytidine analog). This finding is consistent with the patterns of mRNA expression we observed for the major nucleoside transporters (hCNT1a, ENT2, and hENT1) (not shown). However, there were striking differences between test and control cells in GCV accumulation: the steady-state concentration of GCV in the MRP4-transfected cells was only ∼50% that in the vector cells (Fig.4 A). This disparity was observed over a wide range of concentrations of GCV (Fig.4 B). We investigated whether efflux was altered in the cells expressing MRP4. First, we treated these cells with ∼1.5 times the amount radiolabeled GCV used to treat control cells to obtain a comparable intracellular GCV concentration. We then washed the cells, placed them in drug-free medium, and measured intracellular radioactive GCV (Fig.4 C). The decline of intracellular GCV was more rapid in the MRP4-transfected cells compared with vector cells (t 1/2 s of ∼16 and 32 min, respectively). This increased efflux was accompanied by a striking decrease in GCV-induced cytotoxicity (Fig. 4 D) but not in MTX-induced cytotoxicity (Fig. 4 E). Similar results were obtained in parallel experiments with Saos-2 cells modified to express MRP4 (not shown). Because MRP4 transports nucleotide derivatives (1Borst P. Evers R. Kool M. Wijnholds J. J. Nat. Cancer Inst. 2000; 92: 1295-1302Crossref PubMed Scopus (1517) Google Scholar, 2Schuetz J.D. Connelly M.C. Sun D. Paibir S.G. Flynn P.M. Srinivas R.V. Kumar A. Fridland A. Nat.

Nephrol. 2002; 13: 595-603PubMed Google Scholar) including GCV anabolites from cells, we reasoned that the killing of bystander cells (those that do not express TK) by GCV could be significantly influenced by MRP4 expression. To explore this possibility, we used an SW620-HSV-TK cell line that activates GCV and readily effluxes GCV nucleotides (27Drake R.R. Pitlyk K. McMasters R.A. Mercer K.E. Young H. Moyer M.P. Mol. Ther. 2000; 2: 515-523Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). We performed a clonal dilution assay (27Drake R.R. Pitlyk K. McMasters R.A. Mercer K.E. Young H. Moyer M.P. Mol. Ther. 2000; 2: 515-523Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) in which either MCF-7 or MCF-7-MRP4 cells were co-cultured with increasing percentages of the SW620 HSV-TK cells (see “Materials and Methods”) (Fig. 5). As the proportion of HSV-TK-expressing cells increases the delivery of GCV metabolite increases (30Rubsam L.Z. Boucher P.D. Murphy P.J. KuKuruga M. Shewach D.S. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 669-675PubMed Google Scholar) leading to greater cell death of bystander cells. The MCF-7-MRP4 cells are more resistant to bystander killing. However, with very high proportions of HSV-TK cells we see that MRP4 overexpression offers less protection. These studies indicate that MRP4 plays a strong role in bystander cell survival, but suggest its protection may be overcome by increasing the proportion of HSV-TK expressing cells. We have shown that expression of MRP4 affects the sensitivity of cells to the therapeutically important antiviral guanine analog GCV and that it modulates the direct and bystander cytotoxicity in which cells modified to express HSV-TK are treated with GCV. Cells that overexpressed MRP4 accumulated smaller quantities of GCV metabolites than did controls. Although the sensitivity to GCV-induced cell cycle arrest was not reduced in these cells, they were protected from GCV cytotoxicity. This finding is consistent with a relationship between GCV cytotoxicity and the intracellular concentration of the drug (7Hochster H. Dieterich D. Bozzette S. Reichman R.C. Connor J.D. Liebes L. Sonke R.L. Spector S.A. Valentine F. Pettinelli C. Richman D. Ann. Intern. Med. 1990; 113: 111-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar,14Yang L. Hwang R. Chiang Y. Gordon E.M. Anderson W.F. Parekh D. Clin. Cancer Res. 1998; 4: 731-741PubMed Google Scholar). However, the effect did not extend to all cytotoxins: sensitivity to methotrexate and vinblastine was not affected. Because we and others have demonstrated that GCV metabolites are readily transported from cells expressing HSV-TK (17Boucher P.D. Ruch R.J. Shewach D.S. Hum. Gene Ther. 1998; 9: 801-814Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 27Drake R.R. Pitlyk K. McMasters R.A. Mercer K.E. Young H. Moyer M.P. Mol.

Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 669-675PubMed Google Scholar), we evaluated the effect of MRP4 expression on GCV cytotoxicity of cells gene-modified to express HSV-TK. HSV-TK cells that overexpressed MRP4 had significantly enhanced resistance to GCV (Fig. 2, A andB). This finding has strong implications for gene therapy with HSV-TK because varying MRP4 expression among cells gene-modified with HSV-TK would lead to decreased cytotoxicity. The success of gene therapy requires not only that the HSV-TK-modified cells export GCV nucleotides but also that the adjacent bystander cells accumulate and retain sufficient nucleotides to induce apoptosis. An increase in the extracellular concentration of GCV can induce the killing of otherwise intractable bystander cells (13Beck C. Cayeux S. Lupton S.D. Dorken B. Blankenstein T. Hum. Gene Ther. 1995; 6: 1525-1530Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), suggesting the existence of a mechanism that excludes GCV nucleotides or decreases their intracellular concentration in these cells. Bystander killing by GCV can also be enhanced by prolonged exposure to the drug (13Beck C. Cayeux S. Lupton S.D. Dorken B. Blankenstein T. Hum. Gene Ther. 1995; 6: 1525-1530Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Our results strongly suggest that expression of MRP4 by bystander cells protects them from GCV cytotoxicity when they are co-cultured with initiator cells expressing HSV-TK (Fig. 5). However, this protection decreases as the proportion of HSV-TK-expressing cells increases, implying that a threshold level of GCV nucleotide is exceeded and overrides the protective effect of MRP4. Nevertheless, this result suggests that cells overexpressing MRP4 would be less susceptible to the bystander effect because of their reduced accumulation of GCV nucleotides. Our results demonstrate that cellular retention and accumulation of the guanine analog ganciclovir is strongly influenced by MRP4. Expression of this nucleotide transporter may reduce the antiviral efficacy of GCV therapy, which is often used to treat or prevent cytomegalovirus disease in transplant recipients and patients with AIDS. It can also attenuate both direct GCV cytotoxicity and bystander cell killing in cells modified to express HSV-TK to induce selective cell killing. We have also shown that cells that express MRP4 are much less susceptible to GCV despite modification with an HSV-TK expression vector. These studies provide the mechanistic basis for future studies evaluating the role of MRP4 expression in antiviral response to GCV and in HSV-TK and GCV gene therapy with solid malignancies (e.g. brain tumors) Finally, a challenge for the future will be to determine the degree to which MRP4 modulates the levels of toxic metabolites near bystander cells.

Many benzylisoquinoline alkaloids are pharmacologically active including the analgesic and antitussive drugs morphine and codeine, the antibiotic sanguinarine, and the muscle relaxants papaverine and tubocurarine. The structural complexity of these pharmaceuticals generally precludes chemical synthesis as an alternative to cultivated plants for their commercial production. All benzylisoquinoline alkaloids share a common biosynthetic origin beginning with a lattice of decarboxylations,ortho-hydroxylations, and deaminations that convertl-tyrosine into both dopamine and 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde (4-HPAA)1 (1Rueffer M. Zenk M.H. Z. Naturforsch. 1987; 42: 319-332Crossref Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The first committed step in benzylisoquinoline alkaloid biosynthesis is catalyzed by norcoclaurine synthase (NCS; EC 4.2.1.78), which condenses dopamine and 4-HPAA to form the trihydroxylated alkaloid (S)-norcoclaurine (see Fig.1). (S)-Norcoclaurine is now accepted as the central precursor to all benzylisoquinoline alkaloids produced in plants (2Stadler R. Kutchan T.M. Lo¨ffler S. Nagakura N. Cassels B.K. Zenk M.H. Tetrahedron Lett. 1987; 28: 1251-1254Crossref Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 3Stadler R. Kutchan T.M. Zenk M.H. Phytochemistry. 1989; 28: 1083-1086Crossref Scopus (87) Google Scholar). However, NCS was first isolated based on its ability to convert dopamine and 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetaldehyde (3,4-DHPAA) to the tetrahydroxylated alkaloid (S)-norlaudanosoline (4Rueffer M., El- Shagi H. Nagakura N. Zenk M.H. FEBS Lett. 1981; 129: 5-9Crossref Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The ability of NCS to accept either 4-HPAA or 3,4-DHPAA as a substrate contributed to the incorrect conclusion that (S)-norlaudanosoline is a common pathway intermediate (4Rueffer M., El- Shagi H. Nagakura N. Zenk M.H. FEBS Lett. 1981; 129: 5-9Crossref Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 5Schumacher H.-M. Ru¨ffer M. Nagakura N. Zenk M.H. Planta Med. 1983; 48: 212-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). However, only (S)-norcoclaurine has been found to occur in plants (6Stadler, R., and Zenk, M. H. (1990) Leibigs Ann. Chem. 555–562Google Scholar). Sequential 6-O-methylation of (S)-norcoclaurine, followed byN-methylation, a P450-dependent 3′ hydroxylation, and subsequent 4′-O-methylation lead to the formation of (S)-reticuline, an important branch-point intermediate in benzylisoquinoline alkaloid biosynthesis. Although cDNA clones have been isolated for the enzymes involved in the conversion of (S)-norcoclaurine to (S)-reticuline (7Pauli H.H. Kutchan T.M.

Previously, we developed a sensitive assay to isolate NCS activity in protein extracts of opium poppy (Papaver somniferum) and related species (10Samanani N. Facchini P.J. Planta. 2001; 213: 898-906Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). We showed that NCS activity occurs at different levels in all organs of the plant and is induced in opium poppy cell suspension cultures treated with a fungal elicitor. Opium poppy NCS was shown to exhibit hyperbolic saturation kinetics for 4-HPAA but sigmoidal saturation kinetics for dopamine suggesting that it plays a regulatory role in the regulation of benzylisoquinoline alkaloid pathways. In this paper, we report the purification to homogeneity and characterization of NCS from cell suspension cultures of meadow rue (Thalictrum flavum). T. flavum is a medicinal member of the Ranunculaceae that accumulates the benzylisoquinoline alkaloids berberine and magnoflorine. Meadow rue (T. flavumssp. glaucum) plants were grown under a photoperiod of 16 h of light and 8 h of darkness at 23 °C. Cell suspension cultures were maintained at 23 °C in diffuse light on a medium consisting of B5 salts and vitamins (11Gamborg O.L. Miller R.O. Ojima K. Exp. Cell Res. 1968; 50: 151-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (7693) Google Scholar), 100 mg liter−1myo-inositol, 1 g liter−1 hydrolyzed casein, 20 g liter−1sucrose, and 1 mg liter−1 2,4 dichlorophenoxyacetic acid. Cells were collected by vacuum filtration and frozen at −80 °C. [8-14C]Dopamine hydrochloride (15.6 Ci mol−1), dopamine hydrochloride, norlaudanosoline (1,2,3,4-tetrahydropapaveroline), and 2-(4-hydroxyphenyl)ethanol were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. 4-HPAA was synthesized by Doering-Parikh oxidation of 2-(4-hydroxyphenyl)ethanol as described previously (10Samanani N. Facchini P.J. Planta. 2001; 213: 898-906Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Sephadex G-25, phenyl-Sepharose 6, Q-Sepharose, and Superose-12 HR 10/30 were obtained from Pharmacia. Hydroxyapatite type 1, protein standards for molecular weight and isoelectric point determinations, and isoelectric focusing gels with immobilized linear pH gradients were purchased from BioRad. The following buffers were used: buffer A, 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5; buffer B, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5; buffer C, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5; and buffer D, 10 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.2. Buffers used to determine optimum pH were 200 mm potassium phosphate, pH 5–7, and 200 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7–9. All buffers contained 10 mm 2-mercaptoethanol. Protein fractions were incubated in buffer A with 311 pmol (5.0 nCi) [8-14C]dopamine and 10 nmol 4-HPAA in a total volume of 30 μl unless stated otherwise. After an incubation period of 1.5 h at 37 °C, the entire reaction volume was applied to a silica gel 60 F254 TLC plate (EM Science). The TLC plates were developed in a solvent system consisting of n-butanol:acetic acid:water (4:1:5) and, subsequently, autoradiographed for 12–24 h using X-OMAT film (Kodak). Radiolabeled spots with an Rf of 0.60 were scrapped from the plate, and the radioactivity quantified by liquid scintillation counting. Controls were performed using protein samples incubated in boiling water for 15 min. NCS activity was calculated after subtracting the background radioactivity produced in control reactions. Protein concentration was determined according to the method of Bradford (12Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217544) Google Scholar) using bovine serum albumin as the standard. Plant cells (1000 g) were ground under liquid nitrogen to a fine powder with a mortar and pestle and extracted in buffer A. The slurry was centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 20 min, and the supernatant was desalted on a Sephadex G-25 column (50 × 230 mm). Solid ammonium sulfate was added to 20% saturation, the extract was centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 20 min, and the pellet was discarded. Additional ammonium sulfate was added to 60% saturation, and the sample was centrifuged again. The pellet was dissolved in buffer B containing 15% ammonium sulfate. The protein extract was loaded onto a Phenyl-Sepharose column (12 mm × 100 mm) equilibrated in buffer B containing 15% ammonium sulfate. The loaded column was thoroughly washed with buffer B before elution of the bound proteins using a 15–0% linear ammonium sulfate gradient over 2 h at a flow rate of 1 ml min−1. After the collection of fraction 78, buffer B was replaced with deionized water at a flow rate of 2 ml/min. Fractions (5 ml) were collected and assayed for NCS activity. Active fractions from phenyl-Sepharose chromatography were pooled and loaded onto a Q-Sepharose column (12 mm × 100 mm) equilibrated in buffer C. The column was thoroughly washed with buffer C before applying a linear gradient of 0–1 m KCl over 2 h at a flow rate of 0.5 ml min−1. Fractions (2.5 ml) were collected and assayed for NCS activity. Active protein from Q-Sepharose chromatography was pooled and the buffer changed to 10 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.2, using Centricon Plus-20 ultrafiltration units (Millipore). The concentrated protein was loaded onto a hydroxyapatite column (12 mm × 100 mm) equilibrated with buffer D. A linear 10–500 mm potassium phosphate gradient was applied over 2 h at a flow rate of 0.5 ml min−1. Fractions (2.5 ml) were collected and assayed for NCS activity. Active fractions from hydroxyapatite chromatography were pooled, the protein was concentrated, and the buffer was changed to buffer A by ultrafiltration. The 200-μl protein sample was applied to two Superose-12 columns (5 mm × 300 mm each) connected in tandem and equilibrated with buffer A. The proteins were eluted with buffer A at a flow rate of 0.2 ml min−1. Fractions (200 μl) were collected and assayed for NCS activity Protein preparations at different stages of purification were visualized by gel electrophoresis under denaturing conditions according to Laemmli (13Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar) using a 17% (w v−1) polyacrylamide gel (SDS-PAGE). The molecular weight of purified NCS was determined from a graph of the log molecular weightversus migration distance of protein standards. Two-dimensional electrophoresis was performed according to the method of O’Farrell (14O'Farrell P. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 4007-4021Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) except that immobilized protein gradient gel strips were used for the first dimension and 17% (w v−1) denaturing polyacrylamide gels for the second dimension. Proteins were visualized by staining gels with Coomassie Brilliant Blue. The molecular weight of native NCS was estimated by gel filtration chromatography on tandem Superose-12 columns (5 mm × 300 mm each) at a flow rate of 0.2 ml/min. The columns were calibrated using bovine serum albumin (67 kDa), ovalbumin (45 kDa), chymotrypsinogen A (25 kDa), and ribonuclease A (12 kDa). The void volume was calculated by the elution of blue dextran 2000. The native protein was treated with dimethyl suberimidate as a chemical cross-linking agent as described previously (15Kapoor M. O'Brien M.D. Can. J. Biochem. 1977; 55: 43-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Protein spots from two-dimensional gel electrophoresis gels were analyzed using a PerSeptive Biosystems Voyager DE-STR matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometer after in-gel trypsin cleavage. NCS activity was detected in roots, stems, leaves, and flower buds of T. flavum plants (Fig. 2). When normalized against total soluble protein, NCS activity was highest in roots and was 1.4-, 1.8-, and 4.5-fold lower in stems, leaves, and flower buds, respectively. NCS activity was also detected in T. flavum cell cultures at levels similar to those found in stems and leaves (Fig. 2). NCS was purified from suspension-culturedT. flavum cells as summarized in TableI. The homogenate from 1000 g of cells was initially centrifuged at 13,000 × g to remove insoluble debris. NCS activity was never associated with the pellet. The desalted supernatant was fractionated by ammonium sulfate precipitation and subjected to hydrophobic interaction chromatography. NCS eluted from the phenyl-Sepharose column in two peaks of activity (Fig. 3A). An initial activity peak eluted between fractions 51 and 77 after the ammonium sulfate concentration in buffer B was reduced to 0%. Continued elution of the column with deionized water beginning at fraction 79 resulted in a second peak of NCS activity between fractions 81 and 88. Protein eluted and stored in deionized water retained NCS activity for several days at 4 °C. Ammonium sulfate precipitation and hydrophobic interaction chromatography enriched NCS activity 13-fold. Subsequent anion exchange chromatography on Q-Sepharose followed by hydroxyapatite chromatography resulted in an additional purification of 4.5-fold. NCS activity eluted as single peaks from the Q-Sepharose column between 500 and 1000 mm potassium chloride (fractions 13 through 23; Fig.3B) and from the hydroxyapatite column between 200 and 350 mm potassium phosphate (fractions 11 through 17; Fig.3C). The final purification step was gel filtration chromatography using tandem Superose-12 columns, which resulted in an overall purification of 1590-fold. NCS activity correlated with the elution of a single protein peak between fractions 54 and 65. However, only 18% of the activity loaded onto the gel filtration column was recovered (Table I). As the purification progressed, a 15-kDa protein became prominent on Coomassie Blue-stained SDS-polyacrylamide gels and was the only detectable protein recovered from the Superose-12 chromatography step (Fig. 4).Table IPurification of NCS from suspension-cultured cells of Thalictrum flavum ssp. glaucumPurification stepTotal proteinTotal activitySpecific activityYieldPurificationmgpicokatalpicokatal mg−1protein%-foldCrude extract1-aCrude extract was prepared from 1000 g of frozen cells.7537340.971001.0Ammonium sulfate1-b20–60% saturation.3174331.37591.4Phenyl-Sepharose24.630712.54212.8Q-Sepharose11.526222.83623.4Hydroxyapatite3.117456.123.757.6Superose-120.0231.015474.215901-a Crude extract was prepared from 1000 g of frozen cells.1-b 20–60% saturation.

Purified NCS eluted with an apparent molecular mass of ∼28 kDa. Chemical cross-linking of native NCS with dimethyl suberimidate also resulted in a 28-kDa polypeptide detectable by SDS-PAGE. The purified protein was subjected to two-dimensional gel electrophoresis using an isoelectric focusing gel with an immobilized linear pH gradient (Fig.5). Two major and two minor charge isoforms were visualized after SDS-PAGE on a Coomassie Blue-stained gel. Calibration of the gel using isoelectric point standards showed pI values of 5.7 and 6.0 for the two major isoforms, and 5.5 and 6.2 for the two minor isoforms. All charge isoforms had the same molecular mass of ∼15 kDa. Matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry on the two major isoforms identified two independent tryptic peptides, representing a total coverage of ∼16%, with identical molecular masses in each protein based on a stringent 0.001% maximum deviation of mass accuracy. Purified NCS showed optimal activity between pH 6.5 and 7.0 and half-maximal activity at pH 6.2, indicating a rapid decline in enzyme function with increasing acidity. However, the enzyme was relatively insensitive to pH increases in the basic range. NCS showed high levels of activity at temperatures between 45 and 55 °C, although half-maximal activities were found at 37 and 57 °C. The purified enzyme was unaffected by the inclusion of either 40 mmCaCl2 or MgCl2 in the standard assay. No detectable loss in NCS activity occurred when the purified protein was stored at −80 °C for 7 days. However, a 75% loss in activity occurred when the protein was stored for 7 days at 4 °C. Varying the concentration of dopamine from 55 to 280 μmat a saturating level (2.0 mm) of 4-HPAA produced sigmoidal saturation kinetics, suggesting positive cooperativity in the binding of dopamine to purified NCS. Hill plot analysis (log[V(Vmax − V)−1]versus log[substrate concentration]) of the effect of dopamine concentration on NCS activity produced a linear function with a Hill coefficient (nH) of 1.8. A Hanes plot ([substrate concentration]nHV−1 versus [substrate concentration]nH), wherenH = 1.8, also produced a linear function confirming the positive cooperativity of dopamine binding to NCS at a saturating level of 4-HPAA. Varying the concentration of 4-HPAA from 0.2 to 1.3 mm at a saturating level (280 μm) of dopamine produced hyperbolic saturation kinetics, indicating the lack of cooperativity in the binding of 4-HPAA to purified NCS. Hill-plot analysis of the effect of 4-HPAA concentration on NCS activity produced a linear function with a nH of 1.0. A Hanes plot, where nH = 1.0, also produced a linear function, confirming that purified NCS displays Michaelis-Menten kinetics for the binding of 4-HPAA at a saturating level of dopamine. A K′ of 0.04 mmnH for dopamine and aKm of 335 μm for 4-HPAA were calculated from the Hanes plots as described previously (10Samanani N. Facchini P.J. Planta. 2001; 213: 898-906Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Similarly, Vmax values of 116 and 65 picokatal mg−1 protein were calculated for dopamine and HPAA, respectively. The order of substrate binding was determined by an analysis of product inhibition patterns using norlaudanosoline as the inhibitor (Fig.6). A Hanes plot showing the activity of purified NCS at different concentrations of one substrate and saturating levels of the second substrate using various fixed concentrations of the inhibitor showed that the binding of norlaudanosoline is uncompetitive with respect to 4-HPAA (Fig.6A), but noncompetitive with respect to dopamine (Fig.6B). The Ki value for norlaudanosoline was 4.7 mm with respect to dopamine. All experiments were performed in duplicate with reproducible results. Norcoclaurine synthase was purified to homogeneity from cell suspension cultures of T. flavum using a 5-step purification procedure. The protocol resulted in an overall purification of 1590-fold with a recovery of 4.2%. Based on the initial NCS activity of the crude extract, the enzyme constituted ∼0.06% of the soluble protein. Despite the relatively low abundance of NCS activity in cultured T. flavum cells, the combination of ammonium sulfate precipitation and hydrophobic interaction, anion exchange, hydroxyapatite, and gel filtration chromatography allowed the enzyme to be purified due to its relatively high hydrophobicity and small molecular mass (Fig. 3). It should be noted that desalting the crude protein extract was necessary to detect NCS activity suggesting the presence of inhibitory compounds. Phenyl-Sepharose chromatography was performed using an ammonium sulfate gradient of 15–0% saturation to prevent precipitation of the protein fraction obtained by an ammonium sulfate fractionation between 20 and 60% saturation. The rapid growth of cultured plant cells has facilitated the purification of several enzymes involved in alkaloid biosynthesis (16Facchini P.J. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 2001; 52: 29-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar). Even though T. flavum roots showed 2-fold higher NCS activity than cultured cells (Fig. 2), large quantities of suspension-cultured cells were easier to produce due to the relatively slow growth rate of the intact plants. T. flavum cell cultures were selected over those of other benzylisoquinoline alkaloid-producing species, such as P. somniferum andEschscholzia californica, for the purification of NCS due to the relative instability of the enzyme in some crude protein extracts (10Samanani N. Facchini P.J. Planta. 2001; 213: 898-906Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). For example, NCS activity could not be recovered after ammonium sulfate precipitation of crude protein extracts from P. somniferum or E. californica cell cultures. The purified 15-kDa band (Fig. 4) was identified as NCS by subjecting consecutive fractions across the peak of enzyme activity obtained by Superose-12 gel filtration chromatography (Fig. 3) to SDS-PAGE analysis (data not shown). The intensity of the 15-kDa, Coomassie Blue-stained band correlated with the relative level of NCS activity and the relative abundance of protein in these fractions. The native molecular mass of 28 kDa, determined by gel filtration chromatography, suggests that the native enzyme is a dimer comprised of two 15-kDa subunits. The dimeric structure of NCS was corroborated by the formation of a 28-kDa polypeptide by chemical cross-linking of the native protein complex (15Kapoor M. O'Brien M.D. Can. J. Biochem. 1977; 55: 43-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). These results are at variance with the native molecular mass of 15.5 kDa previously reported for NCS (5Schumacher H.-M. Ru¨ffer M. Nagakura N. Zenk M.H. Planta Med. 1983; 48: 212-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). However, it should be noted that a partially purified enzyme extract and a lower performance Sephadex G-100 column were used in this earlier study. The detection of four NCS isoforms, two of relatively high abundance and two of lower abundance (Fig. 5), is in agreement with a previous characterization of the enzyme (5Schumacher H.-M. Ru¨ffer M. Nagakura N. Zenk M.H. Planta Med. 1983; 48: 212-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The existence of four charge isoforms was indicated by the migration of NCS activity in partially purified protein extracts using disc gel electrophoresis. The presence of four isoforms suggests that native NCS is either a homodimer consisting of only one isoform or a heterodimer comprised of two different isoforms. Matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry showed that the two major NCS charge isoforms are related; thus, the native protein complex consists of two similar, if not identical, subunits. The characterization of NCS as a dimer is also consistent with the sigmoidal binding kinetics of dopamine, which demonstrates the cooperative binding of this substrate. The Hill coefficient for dopamine (nH = 1.8) suggests that NCS displays positive cooperativity between the dopamine binding sites on each subunit. The sigmoidal binding kinetics of dopamine and hyperbolic binding kinetics of 4-HPAA for NCS from T. flavumare consistent with the substrate binding kinetics of the enzyme fromP. somniferum and E. californica (10Samanani N. Facchini P.J. Planta. 2001; 213: 898-906Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Invariably, enzymes exhibiting sigmoidal substrate saturation kinetics play a regulatory role in metabolism. As such, NCS responds to a relatively modest increase in dopamine concentration with a substantial increase in activity because the binding of dopamine to one subunit increases the affinity for dopamine of the other subunit. Dopamine was detected at a level of 16% (w dry w−1) in culturedPapaver bracteatum cells (17Kutchan T.M. Rush M. Coscia C.J. Plant Physiol. 1986; 81: 161-166Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and found at concentrations of 1 mg ml−1 in the latex of P. bracteatum andP. somniferum (18Roberts M.F. McCarthy D. Kutchan T.M. Coscia C.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1983; 222: 599-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). However, the dopamine pool was shown to be localized within a vacuolar compartment in cultured P. bracteatum cells (17Kutchan T.M. Rush M. Coscia C.J. Plant Physiol. 1986; 81: 161-166Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) suggesting that the subcellular trafficking of dopamine, and its availability to NCS, represent additional levels of regulation. NCS from T. flavum exhibited optimum catalytic activity between pH 6.5 and 7.0, did not require Mg2+ or Ca2+ as reported for NCS from Eschscholzia tenuifolia (5Schumacher H.-M. Ru¨ffer M. Nagakura N. Zenk M.H. Planta Med. 1983; 48: 212-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), and displayed a broad temperature optimum between 45 and 55 °C suggesting that the enzyme is relatively thermostable. Overall, the properties of NCS from T. flavum are consistent with those of the enzyme from P. somniferum and E. californica (10Samanani N. Facchini P.J. Planta. 2001; 213: 898-906Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The kinetic mechanism for NCS was also investigated. NCS catalyzes a condensation reaction between dopamine and 4-HPAA resulting in the formation of a single product, (S)-norcoclaurine (Fig. 1). Hanes plots were used to determine the binding order of 4-HPAA and dopamine (Fig. 6). Norlaudanosoline was used as the inhibitor due to the unavailability of (S)-norcoclaurine. NCS has been shown to catalyze the condensation of dopamine with 4-HPAA or 3,4-DHPAA with equal efficiency, leading to the formation of (S)-norcoclaurine or (S)-norlaudanosoline, respectively (4Rueffer M., El- Shagi H. Nagakura N. Zenk M.H. FEBS Lett. 1981; 129: 5-9Crossref Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Thus, norlaudanosoline is expected to inhibit NCS activity in the same manner as norcoclaurine. It is notable that (S)-norcoclaurine and (S)-norlaudanosoline, or their 6-O-methylated derivatives, are accepted as substrates by the 6-O-methyltransferase and N-methyltransferase, respectively, involved in subsequent steps of the benzylisoquinoline alkaloid pathway (19Sato F. Tsujita T. Katagiri Y. Yoshida S. Yamada Y. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 225: 125-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 20Frenzel T. Zenk M.H. Phytochemistry. 1990; 29: 3491-3497Crossref Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The Hanes plot showing the activity of purified NCS at different concentrations of dopamine, saturating levels of 4-HPAA, and various fixed concentrations of norlaudanosoline reflects a decrease inVmax, but constant Km, as the amount of inhibitor was increased (Fig. 6A). In contrast, the Hanes plot showing the activity of purified NCS at different concentrations of 4-HPAA, saturating levels of dopamine, and various fixed concentrations of norlaudanosoline reflects a decrease in bothVmax and Km, with a constantVmaxKm−1 ratio as the amount of inhibitor was increased (Fig. 6B). Thus, the product inhibition pattern is consistent with uncompetitive binding with respect to 4-HPAA and noncompetitive binding with respect to dopamine, indicating that 4-HPAA binds to the enzyme before dopamine. The Hill coefficient for dopamine (nH = 1.8) did not change in response to increasing inhibitor concentrations. The product inhibition patterns also imply that 4-HPAA combines with a different form of the enzyme than the alkaloid because the inhibitor and first substrate do not bind competitively (21Plowman K. Enzyme Kinetics. Oxford University Press, New York1972Google Scholar). After the product is released, NCS appears to undergo a conformational change reverting back to a form to which 4-HPAA can bind before another reaction sequence can begin (22Segel I.H. Enzyme Kinetics: Behaviour and Analysis of Rapid Equilibrium and Steady-state Enzyme Systems. J. Wiley and Sons, New York1975Google Scholar). Overall, the product inhibition patterns are consistent with an iso-ordered, bi-uni mechanism for NCS. NCS shows several features that are similar to strictosidine synthase (STR), which couples tryptamine and secologanin as the first committed step in monoterpenoid indole alkaloid biosynthesis. Both enzymes catalyze condensation reactions between amine and aldehyde substrates. Four STR isoforms were isolated from cell cultures ofCatharanthus roseus, all of which exhibited cooperative binding kinetics for secologanin (23Pfitzner U. Zenk M.H. Planta Med. 1989; 55: 525-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Cooperative substrate binding might have evolved as a parallel mechanism to provide NCS and STR with a regulatory role in their respective pathways. STR and NCS also display similar native molecular masses of 31 and 28 kDa, respectively (24Meijer A.H. Verpoorte R. Hoge J.H.C. J. Plant Res. 1993; 3: 145-164Google Scholar). However, STR is composed of a single polypeptide, whereas NCS appears to be a dimer, suggesting that the enzymes are not structurally related. It is also interesting to note that deacetylipecoside synthase, which catalyzes the condensation of dopamine and secologanin, is a monomer with a native molecular mass of 30 kDa (25De-Eknamkul W. Suttipanta N. Kutchan T.M. Phytochemistry. 2000; 55: 177-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The purification of NCS represents the first step in the isolation of the corresponding gene, the availability of which will reveal its evolutionary relationship with STR. Moreover, the key function of NCS in the formation of valuable benzylisoquinoline alkaloids makes the enzyme an intriguing target for molecular characterization. The unique biochemical characteristics of NCS, including its low molecular weight and sigmoidal substrate binding kinetics, also warrant crystallographic studies to better understand its catalytic mechanism and determine its role in the regulation of benzylisoquinoline alkaloid biosynthesis.

IL-18 induces the release of Th1 cytokines by T cells and macrophages and also stimulates the production of inflammatory mediators, such as chemokines by synovial fibroblasts or nitric oxide by macrophages and chondrocytes (1McInnes I.B. Gracie J.A. Liew F.Y. Arthritis Rheum. 2001; 44: 1481-1483Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 2Morel J.C. Park C.C. Kumar P. Koch A.E. Lab. Invest. 2001; 81: 1371-1383Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Additionally, we have shown that IL-18 acts upon endothelial cells to induce angiogenesis and cell adhesion (3Park C.C.

Chem. 2001; 276: 37069-37075Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). IL-18 is mainly produced by activated macrophages, whereas the IL-18 receptor (IL-18R) is expressed on T lymphocytes, natural killer cells, macrophages, neutrophils, and chondrocytes (1McInnes I.B. Gracie J.A. Liew F.Y. Arthritis Rheum. 2001; 44: 1481-1483Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 5Okamura H. Tsutsui H. Kashiwamura S. Yoshimoto T. Nakanishi K. Adv.

The IL-18R complex is composed of two protein chains α and β. The IL-18Rα is the extracellular binding domain of the IL-18R complex, whereas the IL-18Rβ is the signal transducing chain. When IL-18 binds to the IL-18R, it induces the formation of an IL-1R-associated kinase (IRAK)/TNF receptor-associated factor 6 (TRAF-6) complex that subsequently activates nuclear factor κB (NFκB) in Th1 cells (7Matsumoto S. Tsuji-Takayama K. Aizawa Y. Koide K. Takeuchi M. Ohta T. Kurimoto M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 234: 454-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar) and in EL4/6.1 thymoma cells (8Thomassen E. Bird T.A. Renshaw B.R. Kennedy M.K. Sims J.E. J. Interferon Cytokine Res. 1998; 18: 1077-1088Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). IL-18 also operates through IRAK-independent pathways that remain to be elucidated. For instance, IL-18 mediates interferon-γ (INF-γ) production by the mitogen-activated protein kinases p38 and p42/44, also known as ERK1/2 (9Kalina U. Kauschat D. Koyama N. Nuernberger H. Ballas K. Koschmieder S. Bug G. Hofmann W.K. Hoelzer D. Ottmann O.G. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 1307-1313Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3-kinase) is a lipid kinase that consists of catalytic (p110) and regulatory (p85) subunits. PI3-kinase catalyzes the phosphorylation of the inositol phospholipids at position 3 to generate phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphates, phosphatidylinositol 3,4-biphosphates, and phosphatidylinositol 3–5-triphosphates. These phosphorylated lipid products act as second messengers, activating protein kinases such as Akt (also known as protein kinase B). PI3-kinase is activated by a large spectrum of cytokines, growth factors, and hormones (10Fry M.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1226: 237-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). This activation of PI3-kinase is generally regulated by receptor tyrosine kinase and non-receptor tyrosine kinase (NRTK). PI3-kinase can also be activated by G-protein-coupled receptors or by the small GTPase Ras (11Kapeller R. Cantley L.C. Bioessays. 1994; 16: 565-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (553) Google Scholar, 12Rodriguez-Viciana P. Warne P.H. Dhand R. Vanhaesebroeck B. Gout I. Fry M.J. Waterfield M.D. Downward J. Nature. 1994; 370: 527-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (1731) Google Scholar). PI3-kinase has been implicated as a key signaling molecule for transcription factor activation, protein synthesis, angiogenesis, and cell adhesion (13Toker A. Cantley L.C. Nature. 1997; 387: 673-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (1229) Google Scholar, 14Jiang B.H. Zheng J.Z. Aoki M. Vogt P.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 1749-1753Crossref PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar). We recently showed that the PI3-kinase inhibitor LY294002 inhibited RA synovial fibroblast IL-18-induced VCAM-1 expression by 50% when used alone and by 85% when used with the NFκB inhibitor pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate (2Morel J.C. Park C.C. Kumar P. Koch A.E. Lab. Invest. 2001; 81: 1371-1383Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). These results suggested the existence of at least two independent pathways involved in IL-18-induced adhesion molecule expression. Further investigation of IL-18-induced signaling mechanisms revealed involvement of Src, an NRTK that functions in ligand-induced cellular responses, such as leukocyte survival, adhesion, migration, and proliferation. Src has also been implicated in various cancers and in bone resorption (15Jeschke M. Brandi M.L. Susa M. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1998; 13: 1880-1889Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Activation of Src requires phosphorylation at its activation site Tyr-418 concomitantly with decreased phosphorylation at its negative regulatory site Tyr-529; regulation also involves phosphorylation on other residues such as Tyr-215. c-Src activation by tyrosine kinase receptors leads to translocation from the plasma membrane to the cytoskeleton, where Src interacts with a host of proteins that orchestrate cell-matrix adhesion and cell migration (16Verbeek B.S. Vroom T.M. Rijksen G. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 248: 531-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Here we found that IL-18 directly activates Src with rapid kinetics, and Src activation appears to be an early event common to the PI3-kinase/Akt and ERK1/2 pathways. There is precedence for the involvement of transcription factor activation in IL-18-mediated immune and inflammatory functions. For instance, IL-18 activates AP-1 and NFκB in the Jurkat T cell leading to IL-2 expression (17Greene C.M. Meachery G. Taggart C.C. Rooney C.P. Coakley R. O'Neill S.J. McElvaney N.G. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 4718-4724Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). We therefore examined involvement of the PI3-kinase and ERK1/2 signaling pathways in AP-1 activation. Because many cytokine-mediated functions, including IL-18-induced IFN-γ expression, are regulated via NFκB activation (18Kojima H. Aizawa Y. Yanai Y. Nagaoka K. Takeuchi M. Ohta T. Ikegami H. Ikeda M. Kurimoto M. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 5063-5069PubMed Google Scholar, 19Tsuji-Takayama K. Aizawa Y. Okamoto I. Kojima H. Koide K. Takeuchi M. Ikegami H. Ohta T. Kurimoto M. Cell. Immunol. 1999; 196: 41-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), its significance in IL-18-induced VCAM-1 expression was examined. One approach for determining the role of the NFκB pathway is by way of IRAK involvement, because IRAK is known to be associated with NFκB upon IL-18 stimulation (20Robinson D. Shibuya K. Mui A. Zonin F. Murphy E. Sana T. Hartley S.B. Menon S. Kastelein R. Bazan F. O'Garra A. Immunity. 1997; 7: 571-581Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (641) Google Scholar, 21Thomas J.A. Allen J.L. Tsen M. Dubnicoff T. Danao J. Liao X.C. Cao Z. Wasserman S.A. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 978-984PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, IRAK was initially cloned and characterized as a kinase associated with the IL-1 receptor (22Cao Z. Henzel W.J. Gao X. Science. 1996; 271: 1128-1131Crossref PubMed Scopus (777) Google Scholar), suggesting its importance to IL-18 signaling as IL-18 is a member of the IL-1 family. Because antisense oligodeoxynucleotides (ODNs) offer a potential gene therapy strategy to block transcription or translation of specific genes, antisense ODNs to relevant signaling molecules were employed to examine RA synovial fibroblast signaling events following IL-18 stimulation. Ultimately, the treatment effect of antisense ODN on IL-18-induced VCAM-1 expression implicated specific signaling molecules involved in RA synovial fibroblast VCAM-1 expression. The ability of these antisense ODNs to inhibit IL-18-induced activation of the transcription factor NF-κB and downstream VCAM-1 expression was also assessed. We examined the signal transduction mechanisms by which IL-18 induces VCAM-1 expression in RA synovial fibroblasts. Our findings demonstrate that IL-18 induced VCAM-1 expression through Src kinase, PI3-kinase/Akt, and ERK1/2 pathways. The important role of the IRAK/NFκB pathway in VCAM-1 expression was also elucidated. Finally, we describe a new signaling cascade involving Src/Ras/Raf/ERK/AP-1 in IL-18-stimulated RA synovial fibroblasts.

Fibroblasts were isolated from synovium obtained from RA patients meeting the American College of Rheumatology criteria for RA who had undergone total joint replacement surgery or synovectomy (23Arnett F.C. Edworthy S.M. Bloch D.A. McShane D.J. Fries J.F. Cooper N.S. Healey L.A. Kaplan S.R. Liang M.H. Luthra H.S. Medsger T.A.J. Mitchell D.M. Neustadt D.H. Pinals R.S. Schaller J.G. Sharp J.T. Wilder R.L. Hunder G.G. Arthritis Rheum. 1988; 31: 315-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (18700) Google Scholar). Fresh synovial tissues were minced and digested in solution of dispase, collagenase, and DNase. Cells were used at passage 5 or older, at which time they were a homogeneous population of fibroblasts. Synovial fibroblasts were grown in 175-mm tissue culture flasks (Falcon, Franklin Lakes, NJ) at 37 °C, in a humidified atmosphere with 5% CO2. Upon confluence, cells were passaged by brief trypsinization as described previously (24Koch A.E. Polverini P.J. Leibovich S.J. Arthritis Rheum. 1986; 29: 471-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). RA synovial fibroblasts were plated onto 6- or 10-cm Petri dishes (Falcon) at 1 × 105 cells/ml and allowed to adhere for 24 h at 37 °C in 5% CO2 atmosphere. Alternatively, for ODN experiments, fibroblasts were plated at 4 × 106cells/well on 6-well plates. Fibroblasts were serum-starved for at least 14 h before stimulation with IL-18 (10 nm) for 0, 5, 10, and 20 min. At the end of each period, supernatants were gently aspirated, and fibroblasts were lysed in extraction buffer containing 100 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm NaF, 20 mm NaP2O4, 2 mmNa3VO4, 1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, 0.1% SDS, 0.5% deoxycholate, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and protease inhibitors (1 tablet/10 ml). For experiments with signaling inhibitors, RA synovial fibroblasts were preincubated with the respective inhibitor for 60–120 min before activation with IL-18. For the ODN experiments the cells were treated as detailed and lysed similarly. Nuclei were pelleted (1250 × g at 4 °C for 5 min), and supernatants of different samples were collected for determination of protein content using a BCA protein assay kit. Cell lysates were mixed 1:1 with Laemmli's sample buffer, boiled for 5 min, and then centrifuged at 10,000 × gfor 10 min. Equal amounts (or 15 μg) of each sample was subjected to 10% SDS-PAGE. Separated proteins were electrophoretically transferred from the gel onto nitrocellulose membranes using a semi-dry transblotting apparatus (Bio-Rad). To block nonspecific binding, membranes were incubated with 5% milk in Tris-buffered saline containing 0.1% Tween 20 (TBST) for 1 h at room temperature. Blots were incubated in respective primary antibody in TBST + 5% milk at 4 °C overnight. After washing with TBST, blots were incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated sheep anti-mouse IgG (1:10,000) or with goat anti-rabbit IgG (1:10,000) for 1 h at room temperature. An ECL detection system (Amersham Biosciences) was used to detect specific protein bands. Different bands were then scanned and quantitated using the software UN-SCAN-IT version 5.1 (Silk Scientific, Orem, UT). Blots were subsequently stripped and restained with antibody to tubulin to determine relative band densities. RA synovial fibroblasts (8 × 105 cells) were plated in 10 cm-dishes in RPMI 1640 containing 10% FBS, 1% penicillin/streptomycin. Once cells were 80–90% confluent, they were further incubated in serum-free RPMI 1640 for at least 14 h. RA synovial fibroblasts were then stimulated with IL-18 (10 nm) for 0, 10, and 20 min at 37 °C. At the end of the incubation, cell lysate was prepared. Protein content of each sample was quantitated using a BCA protein assay kit and normalized according to the protein concentration. 500 μg of each sample in 500 μl of lysis buffer was incubated overnight at 4 °C with 5 μl of rabbit anti-PI3-kinase antibody directed against the 85-kDa regulatory subunit. 60 μl of protein A-agarose conjugate (50% slurry in PBS) was added to each sample and further incubated for 1 h at 4 °C. The immunoprecipitates were collected by centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 10 s. The immunoprecipitates were then washed 3 times with buffer A (137 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, and 0.1 mm sodium orthovanadate) containing 1% nonionic detergent IGEPAL CA-630, followed by 3 washes with buffer B (0.1m Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 5 mm lithium chloride, and 0.1 mm sodium orthovanadate) and 3 washes with TNE (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, and 5 mm EDTA) containing 0.1 mm sodium orthovanadate. To each sample, the following reagents were added sequentially: 50 μl of TNE, 10 μl (20 μg) of phosphatidylinositol (PI, in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4 containing 1 mmEGTA), and 10 μl of 100 mm MgCl2. The PI reaction was initiated with addition of 5 μl of [γ-32P]ATP. The reaction mixture was incubated at 37 °C for 15 min with continuous agitation. The reaction was stopped by addition of 20 μl of 6 n HCl. Radiolabeled lipid was extracted from the reaction sample by adding 160 μl of CH3Cl/MeOH (1:1), vortexing, and separating the organic and aqueous phases by centrifugation for 10 min at 14,000 ×g. 50 μl of radiolabeled lipid containing the lower organic phase were spotted onto oxalate-treated TLC plates (Fisher) and developed in CHCl3/MeOH/H2O/NH4OH (60:47:11.3:2). TLC plates were dried and autoradiographed. Ras activation was studied using a Ras activation kit (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.). RA synovial fibroblasts were stimulated with IL-18 (10 nm) for different times. At each time point, synovial fibroblast extracts were prepared with cell lysis buffer, and protein content in each sample was quantitated. The Ras activation assay involved two steps. In the first step, the activated form of Ras was immunoprecipitated from 800 μg of each synovial fibroblast lysate sample with an immobilized Raf-1-Ras binding domain (Raf-1-RBD) and subsequently run on 10% SDS-PAGE as described above. The presence of activated Ras in samples was then detected by probing with a specific mouse monoclonal anti-Ras antibody (1 μg/ml). Different bands were then scanned and quantitated using an imaging densitometer. Src kinase was first immunoprecipitated with agarose beads conjugated with anti-Src antibody (mouse monoclonal IgG1). RA synovial fibroblasts were plated at 1 × 106 cells on 10-cm culture dishes, adhered overnight in complete media, serum-starved overnight, and stimulated with IL-18 (10 nm) for 10 min. Cells were washed in cold PBS and lysed with 0.5 ml of RIPA buffer. The total cell lysate was diluted to 1 μg/μl with PBS, and 1 mg was mixed with 4 μg (8 μl) of anti-Src antibody-conjugated agarose beads and gently rocked at 4 °C for 2 h. Beads were collected by microcentrifuging (5 s at 14,000 × g), the supernatant was drained, and beads were then washed (3 times) with ice-cold PBS. Samples containing agarose beads, Src antibody, and Src protein in complex were then used to determine Src kinase activation. Direct activation of Src was examined with n Src kinase assay kit (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.) to measure the ability of activated Src to act on known substrate. Stock solutions necessary for the assay were prepared as follows: Src substrate peptide (600 μm, diluted in SrcRB), purified Src kinase (p60 c-Src, 20units/10 μl/test), [γ-32P]ATP (PerkinElmer Life Sciences, 1 mCi/100 μl, 3000 Ci/mmol, further diluted to 1 μCi/μl with Src manganese/ATP mixture), and 0.075% phosphoric acid (diluted from 85% with PBS). Substrate peptide (10 μl, 150 μm final concentration) was added to 10 μl of SrcRB, to which was added 10 μl of Src (p60, c-Src, 20 units) or immunoprecipitated sample (200 μg minimum) and 10 μl of diluted [γ-32P]ATP (10 μCi) in a microcentrifuge tube. The reagent mixture was incubated for 10 min at 30 °C with agitation. To precipitate peptides, 20 μl of 40% trichloroacetic acid was added to each mixture and incubated at room temperature for 5 min. Onto the center of P81 phosphocellulose paper squares, 25 μl of each sample was spotted. Squares were washed with 0.75% phosphoric acid (5 times for 5 min) and acetone (once for 3 min). Samples were read in a scintillation counter, and counts/min of immunoprecipitated enzyme samples were compared with counts/min of the background control samples (no enzyme). This assay was performed with fibroblasts from 4 different RA donors. Sequences of the ODNs employed in this study are listed in Table I. Antisense ODNs were selected for sequence target to c-Src (25Chellaiah M. Fitzgerald C. Alvarez U. Hruska K. J. Biol.

The corresponding sense ODN was used as control for each antisense ODN. The ODNs were synthesized and purified by the Northwestern University Biotechnology Laboratory and modified with phosphorothioate. Lipofection-encapsulated ODNs were prepared using LipofectAMINE and LipofectAMINE Plus Reagent from Invitrogen. Each ODN was reconstituted to 0.4 μg/μl concentration in double distilled water and then diluted in Opti-MEM media as detailed. For transient transfection of cells, ODN/Plus reagent-LipofectAMINE complex was prepared with 40 μg of ODN/100 μl of serum-free Opti-MEM with 2.5 μl of Plus reagent and 4 μg of LipofectAMINE Reagent/100 μl of serum-free Opti-MEM and incubation at room temperature for 30 min, followed by dilution with another 800 μl of Opti-MEM serum-free medium for an additional 15-min incubation. RA synovial fibroblasts were plated at 90% confluency at 4 × 105 cells per well on 6-well plates or per 6-cm dish and allowed to adhere in RPMI, 10% FBS, 1% penicillin and streptomycin. After attachment, cells were then treated with 5 μm of antisense or sense ODN by incubation with 1 ml of ODN/Plus reagent/LipofectAMINE complex for 5 h, followed by media change to complete RPMI, 10% FBS, 1% penicillin and streptomycin overnight. The media were also changed to serum-free RPMI, 1% penicillin and streptomycin for 8–10 h prior to stimulation with IL-18 (10 nm, 10 min, for the Western blot and Src kinase experiments; 5 nm, 8 h, for VCAM-1 expression by flow cytometry experiments).Table IODN sequences used in treatmentsODNSequence (5′-3′)Antisense IRAK-1CCC CCC GGC CAT GGC TGCSense IRAK-1GCA GCC ATG GCC GGG GGGAntisense c-SrcGGG CTT GCT CTT GCT GCT CCC CATSense c-SrcATG GGG AGC AGC AAG AGC AAG CCCAntisense PI3-kinaseGTA CTG GTA CCC CTC AGC ACT CATSense PI3-kinaseATG AGT GCT GAG GGG TAC CAG TACAntisense ERK1/2GCC GCC GCC GCC GCC ATSense ERK1/2ATG GCG GCG GCG GCG GC Open table in a new tab For the chemical inhibition experiments, RA synovial fibroblasts were plated onto 6-cm Petri dishes (Falcon) at 1 × 105 cells/ml and allowed to adhere overnight, and cells were pretreated with pertussis toxin (100 ng/ml) for 12 h before stimulation with IL-18 (10 nm) for 8 h. For the ODN experiments, RA synovial fibroblasts were plated and treated as detailed above prior to IL-18 (5 nm) stimulation for 8 h. Cells were harvested with a cell scraper and transferred to fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) tubes (BD PharMingen). Cells were then treated with mouse anti-VCAM-1 or isotype-matched control (5 μg/ml) as primary antibody followed by incubation for 30 min with PE-conjugated goat anti-mouse antibody (1.5 μg/ml). Samples were washed twice with PBS, 1% FBS, and then fixed with 1% paraformaldehyde. Samples were assayed using an Epics XL-MCL flow cytometer (Beckman Coulter). Prior to data acquisition, the PE channel was standardized using fluorescent beads (Rainbow Beads, Spherotech, Libertyville, IL). Isotype-matched control values were subtracted from the test results. RA ST fibroblasts were plated on 96-well tissue culture plates in RPMI 1640, 10% fetal calf serum and adhered for 14 h. Cells were preincubated with specific inhibitors or Me2SO vehicle control in RPMI 1640, 2% fetal calf serum before stimulation with IL-18 (5 nm) for 8 h. Inhibitors (LY294002, PP2, SB203580, and PD98059) or vehicle Me2SO were applied to cells for 60 min, and then cells were stimulated with IL-18 (5 nm) for 12 h. Cell viability was judged by trypan blue exclusion and was >90%. RA synovial fibroblasts were successively fixed in 3.7% formalin in PBS and blocked in PBS, 1% bovine serum albumin, 5% goat serum for 15 min. After successive incubations in mouse anti-human VCAM-1 or isotype-matched control for 2 h, goat anti-mouse IgG peroxidase-conjugated antibody was added for 1 h, and the ELISA was developed with tetramethylbenzidine substrate.

https://openalex.org/W1986930808,"GAP-43 (neuromodulin) is a protein kinase C substrate that is abundant in developing and regenerating neurons. Thioester-linked palmitoylation at two cysteines near the GAP-43 N terminus has been implicated in directing membrane binding. Here, we use mass spectrometry to examine the stoichiometry of palmitoylation and the molecular identity of the fatty acid(s) attached to GAP-43in vivo. GAP-43 expressed in either PC12 or COS-1 cells was acetylated at the N-terminal methionine. Approximately 35% of the N-terminal GAP-43 peptides were also modified by palmitate and/or stearate on Cys residues. Interestingly, a variety of acylated species was detected, in which one of the Cys residues was acylated by either palmitate or stearate, or both Cys residues were acylated by palmitates or stearates or a combination of palmitate and stearate. Depalmitoylation of membrane-bound GAP-43 did not release the protein from the membrane, implying that additional forces function to maintain membrane binding. Indeed, mutation of four basic residues within the N-terminal domain of GAP-43 dramatically reduced membrane localization of GAP-43 without affecting palmitoylation. These data reveal the heterogeneous nature of S-acylation in vivo and illustrate the power of mass spectrometry for identification of key regulatory protein modifications. GAP-43 (neuromodulin) is a protein kinase C substrate that is abundant in developing and regenerating neurons. Thioester-linked palmitoylation at two cysteines near the GAP-43 N terminus has been implicated in directing membrane binding. Here, we use mass spectrometry to examine the stoichiometry of palmitoylation and the molecular identity of the fatty acid(s) attached to GAP-43in vivo.

Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1451: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (1074) Google Scholar). N-terminal acetylation is one of the most common protein modifications, occurring on ∼85% of eukaryotic proteins (2Polevoda B. Sherman F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 36479-36482Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). The amino acid residue adjacent to the amino-terminal methionine residue determines whether the N-terminal methionine is retained or removed before acetylation (2Polevoda B. Sherman F. J. Biol.

The initiating Met is removed, and myristate is added to the N-terminal glycine. The requirement for glycine at the N terminus is absolute for N-myristoylation to occur.In contrast to N-terminal acetylation and myristoylation, which occur co-translationally, palmitoylation is a post-translational lipid modification. Nearly all palmitoylated proteins areS-acylated by attachment of palmitate via a thioester linkage to the sulfhydryl group of cysteine. Exceptions include adenylate cyclase toxin from Bordetella pertussis, which is modified by amide-linked palmitoylation on the ε-amino group of lysine residues (3Hackett M. Guo L. Shabanowitz J. Hunt D.F. Hewlett E.L. Science. 1994; 266: 433-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar) and human sonic hedgehog, which is palmitoylated through an amide linkage to the N-terminal cysteine (4Galdes A. J. Biol.

Palmitoylacyl transferases have not been thoroughly purified and characterized. Moreover, no study has directly examined the nature of thioester-linked palmitoylation in vivo at a molecular level.

Use of the sulfhydryl-modifying reagent NEM facilitated the identification of heterogeneously fatty acylated species of GAP-43 in vivo.

Here we examine the ability of PTN to produce anti-apoptotic signals. We demonstrate that PTN is a survival factor for SW-13 epithelial cells and show that ribozyme-mediated depletion of ALK from SW-13 cells abolishes this effect of PTN. Furthermore, in serum-starved NIH3T3 fibroblasts PTN prevents apoptosis (measured by annexin V staining) with an EC50 of 0.2 ng/ml and induces cell growth at higher concentrations of PTN. A polyclonal antibody against the PTN ligand-binding domain of the ALK receptor (α-LBD) was a partial agonist for ALK in NIH3T3 cells. This α-LBD antibody showed high agonist activity for anti-apoptosis (56 ± 9% relative to PTN), low agonist activity for cell growth (21 ± 1% relative to PTN), and was an antagonist of PTN-induced cell growth (61 ± 2% inhibition). Both MAP kinase and phosphatidylinositol (PI) 3-kinase cascades in NIH3T3 cells were activated by PTN, and this effect persisted for up to 3 h. Surprisingly, the anti-apoptotic effect of PTN was completely blocked by the MAP kinase inhibitor UO126, but was not affected by the PI 3-kinase inhibitor LY294002. In contrast, PTN-dependent cell growth required both MAPK and PI 3-kinase activity. We conclude that anti-apoptotic signaling of PTN through ALK in NIH3T3 fibroblasts is via the MAP kinase pathway.

One of the key elements regulating this balance is growth factor signaling. Growth factors and cytokines have been shown to regulate a wide variety of cellular effects, including cell survival. Growth factor-mediated effects occur through the stimulation of specific intracellular signaling cascades via the intrinsic tyrosine kinase activities of their receptors. For tyrosine kinase receptors, ligand-dependent activation results in autophosphorylation of tyrosine residues within the cytosolic domain of the receptor creating specific binding sites for intracellular signal transduction molecules. A number of growth factors, including insulin-like growth factor I, epidermal growth factor, basic fibroblast growth factor, platelet-derived growth factor, nerve growth factor, and cytokines such as interleukin-3 promote cell survival through pathways requiring the activation of PI1 3-kinase (for review, see Ref. 1Datta S.R. Brunet A. Greenberg M.E. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2905-2927Crossref PubMed Scopus (3721) Google Scholar). The lipid products of PI 3-kinase act as second messengers to stimulate the activity of the serine/threonine kinase Akt (for review, see Ref. 2Rameh L.E. Cantley L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8347-8350Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (852) Google Scholar). Activated Akt has been shown to phosphorylate the pro-apoptotic Bad protein on serine 136, resulting in its dissociation from a complex with Bcl-xl (3Datta S.R. Dudek H. Tao X. Masters S., Fu, H. Gotoh Y. Greenberg M.E. Cell. 1997; 91: 231-241Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4946) Google Scholar). The uncomplexed Bcl-xl can suppress cell death responses by blocking the release of mitochondrial cytochrome c, a critical step in the activation of the downstream caspase cascade, required for apoptosis (4Zha J. Harada H. Yang E. Jockel J. Korsmeyer S.J. Cell. 1996; 87: 619-628Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2254) Google Scholar). Recent reports suggest that Bad can also be phosphorylated in a MAPK-dependent manner at serine 112 (5Scheid M.P. Schubert K.M. Duronio V. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31108-31113Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). This event also will disrupt the association of Bad with the Bcl-2·Bcl-xl complex and inhibit apoptotic signaling (5Scheid M.P. Schubert K.M. Duronio V. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31108-31113Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). Therefore, activation of either PI 3-kinase or Ras/Raf/MAPK can lead to the inhibition of apoptosis in response to growth factor stimuli. Pleiotrophin (PTN) is an 18-kDa heparin-binding growth factor named for its pleiotrophic effects (for review, see Ref. 6Schulte A.M. Wellstein A. Bicknell R. Lewis C.E. Ferrara N. Tumour Angiogenesis. Oxford University Press, Oxford1997: 273-289Google Scholar). The described biological consequences for PTN-mediated signaling include neurite outgrowth, angiogenesis, and mitogenesis of fibroblast, endothelial, epithelial, and some tumor cell lines. We have previously reported that PTN can induce the activation of both the MAPK and PI 3-kinase pathways in bovine epithelial lens (BEL) cells, and we have also demonstrated a direct role for PTN in mitogenesis (7Souttou B. Ahmad S. Riegel A.T. Wellstein A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19588-19593Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). In fact, most of the published literature on PTN has described the role of this growth factor within the context of cell growth and proliferation (8Jager R. Noll K. Havemann K. Pfluger K.H. Knabbe C.

Our laboratory recently identified a tyrosine kinase receptor for PTN, the anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) (13Stoica G.E. Kuo A. Aigner A. Sunitha I. Souttou B. Malerczyk C. Caughey D.J. Wen D. Karavanov A. Riegel A.T. Wellstein A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 16772-16779Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar). Published literature on the tyrosine kinase portion of this receptor was generated originally from clinical studies where a t (2:5) chromosomal translocation resulted in the fusion of the cytosolic, tyrosine kinase domain of ALK with a nuclear protein, nucleophosmin (NPM) (14Morris S.W. Kirstein M.N. Valentine M.B. Dittmer K.G. Shapiro D.N. Saltman D.L. Look A.T. Science. 1994; 263: 1281-1284Crossref PubMed Scopus (1969) Google Scholar, 15Morris S.W. Naeve C. Mathew P. James P.L. Kirstein M.N. Cui X. Witte D.P. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 2175-2188Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar). This NPM-ALK fusion protein homodimerizes, resulting in constitutive activation of tyrosine kinase activity (16Bischof D. Pulford K. Mason D.Y. Morris S.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2312-2325Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). This translocation is present in more than half of the anaplastic large cell lymphomas, a subgroup of non-Hodgkins lymphomas, and under these conditions NPM-ALK is oncogenic (14Morris S.W. Kirstein M.N. Valentine M.B. Dittmer K.G. Shapiro D.N. Saltman D.L. Look A.T. Science. 1994; 263: 1281-1284Crossref PubMed Scopus (1969) Google Scholar). In the present study we examine PTN-dependent signal transduction via the tyrosine kinase growth factor receptor ALK. We show a concentration-dependent inhibition of apoptosis for NIH3T3 fibroblasts in response to PTN, and we demonstrate that this response is mediated by ALK, the receptor for PTN. This effect is largely due to activation of the MAPK pathway and is independent of the PI 3-kinase pathway. However, at least in NIH3T3 cells, stimulation of PI 3-kinase is involved in mitogenesis, suggesting that both of these pathways are utilized in response to ALK based signaling events. The rabbit polyclonal anti-ALK ligand-binding domain (LBD) antibody was described recently (13Stoica G.E. Kuo A. Aigner A. Sunitha I. Souttou B. Malerczyk C. Caughey D.J. Wen D. Karavanov A.

In brief, antiserum was raised in rabbits against a fusion protein between glutathioneS-transferase and the LBD of pleiotrophin in the ALK receptor extracellular domain. This antiserum was affinity purified, and the resulting anti-LBD antibody was shown to block binding of radiolabeled PTN to the ALK receptor in intact cells (13Stoica G.E. Kuo A. Aigner A. Sunitha I.

All commercially available primary antibodies were from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA) except for the polyclonal anti-phosphotyrosine (Upstate Biotechnology Inc., Lake Placid, NY). The secondary anti-mouse and anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibodies were fromAmersham Biosciences. LY 294002 was purchased from Calbiochem. UO126 was from Promega (Madison, WI). PTN was purified as described previously (7Souttou B. Ahmad S. Riegel A.T. Wellstein A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19588-19593Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). NIH3T3 fibroblast and SW-13 adrenal carcinoma cell lines were obtained from the Lombardi Cancer Center Tissue Culture Shared Resource and originated from the ATCC. Cells were maintained in Falcon flasks (Becton and Dickinson Labware, Plymouth, UK). NIH3T3 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% calf serum, and SW-13 cells were grown in improved minimum essential medium supplemented with 10% FBS. All cell media supplies were from Invitrogen. Cells were grown in the presence of 5% CO2 and passaged early to avoid post-confluent overgrowth. Cells were examined regularly and found to be negative for the presence of Mycoplasmacontamination. ALK-depleted SW-13 cells were generated using stable expression of an ALK specific ribozyme expressed in pCDNA (Invitrogen). Ribozymes targeted to cleave human ALK mRNA at either nucleotide 652 (Rz1) or 4739 (Rz2) relative to the translational start site were constructed with a 7-nucleotide targeting sequence at both the 5′ and 3′ ends, respectively (target sequence Rz1, 5′-ggactggtcatagcttcc-3′; Rz2, 5′-ggaatgtcaattacggct-3′). Construction, function, and specificity were described earlier (17Czubayko F. Riegel A.T. Wellstein A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21358-21363Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18Powers C. Aigner A. Stoica G.E. McDonnell K. Wellstein A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 14153-14158Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar), and the ribozymes were directionally cloned into the pCDNA vector. SW-13 cells were transfected with the expression constructs or control vectors using lipofectamine (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's procedure. Cells were allowed to recover for 2 days before selection of stable transfectants with G418. For colony formation assays, SW-13 and ALK-depleted SW-13 cells were trypsinized, and 1.5 × 104 cells were plated in 35-mm soft agar dishes in triplicate. Soft agar colony formation was evaluated after a 10-day incubation period a described previously (12Fang W. Hartmann N. Chow D.T. Riegel A.T. Wellstein A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25889-25897Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cell growth was measured using the WST-1 assay (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) following the manufacturer's protocol. Briefly, 5,000 cells per well were plated into a 96-well tissue culture treated plate. After overnight incubation, the cells were serum-starved for 18–24 h before the addition of PTN or other treatments to the serum free media. For inhibitor experiments, cells were pretreated with inhibitor for 1 h prior to the addition of PTN. Cell growth was measured after 48 h. Cells were plated at 100,000 per well of a 12-well tissue culture dish and left overnight to settle and spread. Cells were washed three times with PBS, and serum-free medium was added. Pleiotrophin was added directly to the serum-free medium at the indicated concentrations. Cells were incubated for up to 96 h under these conditions. Cell survival during the duration of this assay was examined at 24, 48, 72, and 96 h. Cell morphology was monitored using a Zeiss IM 35 inverted microscope with an MTI CCD725 camera and Olympus 5.2 as a frame grabber. For quantitation, at least 10 fields were imaged, and the cells per field attached to the plate were counted. Apoptosis was measured using a flow cytometry technique to measure the presence of phosphatidylserine in the outer membrane leaflet, a marker of early apoptosis. This assay was performed using the annexin V binding assay kit from Trevigen (Gaithersburg, MD) and the manufacturer's instructions were followed. Briefly, 300,000 cells were plated in a 6-cm tissue culture dish and left overnight to settle and spread. Cells were washed three times with PBS and changed to serum-free medium to induce apoptosis. PTN or the anti-LBD antibody was added directly to the serum-free medium. For inhibitor experiments, cells were pretreated with inhibitor for 1 h prior to the addition of PTN. At 24 h, cells were washed once with PBS, trypsinized, and resuspended briefly in serum containing medium to quench the trypsin. Experiments demonstrated that this had no effect on the measured levels of apoptosis. Cells were washed once in PBS, counted, and 100,000 cells were added to the annexin binding reagents for 15 min in the dark. Propidium iodide was included in the reaction to allow the identification of cells in late apoptosis. Fluorescence was read using a Becton Dickinson Facsort flow cytometer. For total protein lysates, NIH3T3 cells were seeded at 1.4 × 106 per 10-cm dish in serum-containing medium. Cells were left to settle and spread overnight. After washing twice with PBS (150 mm NaCl, 1.9 mm NaH2PO4, pH 7.2), serum-free medium was added, and the cells were serum-starved for 18–24 h. Cells were treated with various doses of PTN for the times indicated. At each time and dose point, cells were washed twice with ice-cold TBS (150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris/HCl, 50 mmTris, pH 7.5). 0.5 ml of lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 50 mm NaCl, 0.05% deoxycholate, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm vanadate, 50 mm NaF) supplemented with CompleteTM, a protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), was then added to each plate. After a short incubation at 4 °C, cell bodies were scraped into the lysis buffer. Samples were briefly sonicated and cell debris removed by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The protein concentration of each sample was determined using the BCA assay (Pierce). For SDS-PAGE and Western blotting 10 μg of each sample was used per lane of a 4–20% gradient gel (Invitrogen). Proteins were electro-transferred to nitrocellulose, nonspecific sites were blocked with 3% bovine serum albumin in PBS, and blots were probed. For immunoprecipitation experiments, 500 μg of each lysate was incubated with a 15-μl suspension of protein A-Sepharose beads (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) for 2 h at 4 °C. After this preclearing step, 2 μg of a polyclonal anti-phosphotyrosine antibody and a 15-μl suspension of protein A-Sepharose beads were incubated with the lysates for 2 h at 4 °C. Beads were washed six times in immunoprecipitation buffer and proteins eluted from the beads by boiling in SDS-PAGE sample buffer under reducing conditions. Protein immunocomplexes were separated by SDS-PAGE on 10% gels and analyzed by Western blot analysis using antibodies as indicated. The Graphpad Prism 3.0 software was used for data analysis. t tests were applied for single comparisons and analysis of variance for multiple comparisons. p values <0.05 were considered statistically significant. We have previously described the cell growth effects of PTN for a number of normal and tumorigenic cell lines. In particular, we have demonstrated that PTN induced colony formation and tumorigenicity of human SW-13 adrenal carcinoma cells (12Fang W. Hartmann N. Chow D.T. Riegel A.T. Wellstein A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25889-25897Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and overexpression of the PTN receptor ALK enhanced the effect of the growth factor on colony formation of these cells (13Stoica G.E. Kuo A. Aigner A. Sunitha I. Souttou B. Malerczyk C. Caughey D.J. Wen D. Karavanov A. Riegel A.T. Wellstein A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 16772-16779Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar). SW-13 cells do not express PTN or the related growth factor midkine (6Schulte A.M. Wellstein A. Bicknell R. Lewis C.E. Ferrara N. Tumour Angiogenesis. Oxford University Press, Oxford1997: 273-289Google Scholar), but they express endogenous ALK, and ALK is phosphorylated rapidly in response to exogenously added PTN (13Stoica G.E. Kuo A. Aigner A. Sunitha I. Souttou B. Malerczyk C. Caughey D.J. Wen D. Karavanov A. Riegel A.T. Wellstein A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 16772-16779Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar). We used this cell line as a first model to study the contribution of PTN signaling through ALK to cell growth and survival. To assess the significance of ALK for the PTN effect, we depleted the endogenous ALK from these cells using ALK-targeted ribozymes as described recently for U87 glioblastoma cells (18Powers C. Aigner A. Stoica G.E. McDonnell K. Wellstein A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 14153-14158Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar) and monitored the response of the cells to PTN. PTN stimulates colony formation of SW-13 cells in soft agar (Fig.1 a; see also Ref. 19Wellstein A. Fang W.J. Khatri A., Lu, Y. Swain S.S. Dickson R.B. Sasse J. Riegel A.T. Lippman M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 2582-2587Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and stable pools of SW-13 cells expressing different ALK-targeted ribozymes (ALK Rz cells) failed to respond to PTN (Fig. 1 a). It is noteworthy that colony formation in response to FGF-2 was not altered significantly in the ALK Rz cells in comparison with control cells (data not shown), supporting the specificity of the ribozyme targeting. This ALK-dependent PTN-induced colony formation of SW-13 cells corroborates our earlier findings that showed a strict relationship between PTN signal transduction and residual ALK levels in U87 glioblastoma cells after ALK depletion by ribozymes (18Powers C. Aigner A. Stoica G.E. McDonnell K. Wellstein A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 14153-14158Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the lack of a growth response of SW-13/ALK Rz cells to PTN supports the notion of ALK as the rate-limiting transmembrane receptor for growth signal transduction of PTN. Since many cell lines undergo apoptosis upon serum starvation, we used this deprivation from a growth stimulus to examine to what extent the PTN/ALK axis contributes to cell survival of SW-13 cells. We compared cell survival of control and ALK Rz cells and found equivalent numbers of surviving cells per field when serum was present (Fig.1 c). In the absence of serum, both cell lines showed a significant reduction in the numbers of surviving cells, and PTN at 1 ng/ml was only able to rescue the control, but not the ALK Rz cells (Fig. 1, b and c). These data show that PTN positively modulates the cell survival of SW-13 cells via signaling through its receptor, ALK. Since the cell growth effects of PTN have been described for a variety of cell lines, including fibroblasts, endothelial, and tumor cell lines (12Fang W. Hartmann N. Chow D.T. Riegel A.T. Wellstein A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25889-25897Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we used an additional model, NIH3T3 fibroblasts, to analyze the survival effects of PTN and dissect the signaling pathway further. Earlier studies showed that NIH3T3 cells are sensitive to PTN-induced mitogenesis, and overexpression of PTN in these cells has been shown to induce a transformed phenotype, including tumorigenicity and tumor metastasis in nude mice (20Chauhan A.K., Li, Y.S. Deuel T.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 679-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). We reported that NIH3T3 cells express ALK (13Stoica G.E. Kuo A. Aigner A. Sunitha I. Souttou B. Malerczyk C. Caughey D.J. Wen D. Karavanov A. Riegel A.T. Wellstein A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 16772-16779Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar), and we reasoned that a comparison of the signaling toward proliferative and anti-apoptotic responses of these cells to PTN would reveal the underlying pathways. First, we confirmed that serum withdrawal induced significant apoptosis. We found that 18 h of serum starvation induced an increase from below 5% of cells to over 50% of cells in apoptosis, and representative data from a typical experiment are shown in Fig.2 a. Inclusion of PTN prevented apoptosis (Fig. 2 a, −serum versus +PTN), and we characterized this effect as concentration-dependent (Fig. 2 b). We found that the maximal response was reached at a PTN concentration of 1.0 ng/ml with an approximate EC50of 0.2 ng/ml (= 12 pm). Serum served as a positive control and conditioned media from control cells as a negative control (Fig.2 b, filled triangle and open circle). In parallel with the anti-apoptotic response of NIH3T3 cells to PTN, we also characterized the growth response (Fig. 2 c). Whereas the EC50 of PTN for anti-apoptotic effects was ∼0.2 ng/ml, this concentration was barely effective on proliferation (compare Fig. 2, b and c), and we estimate a >5-fold difference in the sensitivity of these two cellular responses,i.e. survival and proliferation to PTN. As a next step in the analysis, we used a polyclonal rabbit antibody raised against the LBD of ALK (α-LBD) to evaluate the contribution of ALK to the PTN effects. This antibody was shown earlier to block the binding of PTN to the ALK receptor in intact cells (13Stoica G.E. Kuo A. Aigner A. Sunitha I. Souttou B. Malerczyk C. Caughey D.J. Wen D. Karavanov A. Riegel A.T. Wellstein A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 16772-16779Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar), and we tested this antibody for its activity profile in the cell growth assays. It has been shown that the binding of antibodies to the extracellular domain of tyrosine kinase receptors can induce partial agonist activity (21Stephenson R.P. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1997; 120: 106-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) due the dimerization of the receptor ECD, e.g. the anti-HER-2 antibody 4D5 (22Benz C.C. Scott G.K. Sarup J.C. Johnson R.M. Tripathy D. Coronado E. Shepard H.M. Osborne C.K. Breast Cancer Res. Treat. 1993; 24: 85-95Crossref Scopus (714) Google Scholar) has become one of the best known examples due to the clinical utility of the humanized antibody in the treatment of breast cancer (23Slamon D.J. Leyland-Jones B. Shak S. Fuchs H. Paton V. Bajamonde A. Fleming T. Eiermann W. Wolter J. Pegram M. Baselga J. Norton L. N. Engl. J. Med. 2001; 344: 783-792Crossref PubMed Scopus (9401) Google Scholar). Furthermore, different intrinsic activities for different cellular responses have been reported for a given antibody targeting a specific receptor pathway, e.g. the hepatocyte growth factor receptor c-Met (24Prat M. Crepaldi T. Pennacchietti S. Bussolino F. Comoglio P.M. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111 (Pt. 2): 237-247Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) or the insulin receptor (25Kovacina K.S. Roth R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1881-1887Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Interestingly, we found a relatively low partial agonist activity of the α-LBD for proliferative effects (21 + 1% relative to PTN = 100%; Fig. 2 c). On the other hand, addition of the α-LBD together with a concentration of PTN that stimulates proliferation above the intrinsic activity of the α-LBD antagonized the PTN response by 61 + 2% to a level indistinguishable from that reached by the α-LBD alone (Fig. 2 c, inset). These findings are consistent with the partial agonist activity of the α-LBD antibody and support a functional significance of the α-LBD competition for PTN ALK receptor binding reported earlier (13Stoica G.E. Kuo A. Aigner A. Sunitha I. Souttou B. Malerczyk C. Caughey D.J. Wen D. Karavanov A. Riegel A.T. Wellstein A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 16772-16779Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar). Furthermore, these data provide direct evidence that ALK is a receptor for PTN not only in SW13 and U87 cells, as we have already demonstrated, but is also the receptor for PTN in NIH3T3 cells (13Stoica G.E. Kuo A. Aigner A. Sunitha I. Souttou B. Malerczyk C. Caughey D.J. Wen D. Karavanov A. Riegel A.T. Wellstein A. J. Biol.

Chem. 2002; 277: 14153-14158Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). It should be noted that the concentrations of α-LBD antibody give the total amount of IgG that was purified from rabbit antiserum and control purified IgG used at the same concentrations had no effect (Fig. 2, b and c, open triangle). As described above (Fig. 2, b and c), we observed a >5-fold higher sensitivity of the anti-apoptotic versusthe growth effect of PTN. We hypothesized that this difference might also be reflected in a higher agonist activity of the α-LBD antibody effect on apoptosis. Indeed, the α-LBD antibody showed a concentration-dependent inhibition of apoptosis of serum-starved NIH3T3 cells with a maximal activity of 56 + 9% relative to PTN, the full agonist (Fig. 2 b). This is significantly higher than the 21 + 1% intrinsic activity observed for the growth effect (p < 0.005; Fig. 2 c). However, the EC50 of the antibody for the two effects is indistinguishable. Previously published work using mutant receptor constructs of the insulin-like growth factor I receptor and inhibitors of PI 3-kinase have suggested that PI 3-kinase is a major factor for the transduction of cell survival signals. Later work identified the serine/threonine kinase Akt as a downstream target of PI 3-kinase that in turn will phosphorylate and thereby inactivate the pro-apoptotic proteins BAD, caspase 9, and FKHRL1. We demonstrated previously that PTN signaling will elicit activation of both MAPK and PI 3-kinase in BEL cells (7Souttou B. Ahmad S. Riegel A.T. Wellstein A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19588-19593Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), but only PI 3-kinase in U87 glioblastoma cells due to a constitutive activation of MAPK in those cells (18Powers C. Aigner A. Stoica G.E. McDonnell K. Wellstein A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 14153-14158Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Thus, we initially sought to characterize the activation of these pathways in the NIH3T3 model. We isolated cell lysates from NIH3T3 cells treated with PTN and performed a time course to examine activation of both the MAPK and PI 3-kinase pathways. MAPK activation was measured using phospho-specific antibodies, and the time course showed that MAPK was fully activated by 5 min of exposure to 1.0 ng/ml PTN and that this activation was sustained for up to 3 h (Fig.3 a). To examine PI 3-kinase activation we tested phosphorylation of both Akt and the p85 subunit of PI 3-kinase. To confirm that Akt was activated in parallel with PI 3-kinase, phosphorylated proteins were immunoprecipitated, and p85 was detected by Western blotting. Both p85 and Akt were maximally phosphorylated by 5 min of exposure to PTN, and this activation was also sustained over the entire 3-h time course (Fig. 3 b). This time course"
https://openalex.org/W2163664662,"The red cell membrane derives its elasticity and resistance to mechanical stresses from the membrane skeleton, a network composed of spectrin tetramers. These are formed by the head-to-head association of pairs of heterodimers attached at their ends to junctional complexes of several proteins. Here we examine the dynamics of the spectrin dimer-dimer association in the intact membrane. We show that univalent fragments of spectrin, containing the dimer self-association site, will bind to spectrin on the membrane and thereby disrupt the continuity of the protein network. This results in impairment of the mechanical stability of the membrane. When, moreover, the cells are subjected to a continuous low level of shear, even at room temperature, the incorporation of the fragments and the consequent destabilization of the membrane are greatly accentuated. It follows that a modest shearing force, well below that experienced by the red cell in the circulation, is sufficient to sever dimer-dimer links in the network. Our results imply 1) that the membrane accommodates the enormous distortions imposed on it during the passage of the cell through the microvasculature by means of local dissociation of spectrin tetramers to dimers, 2) that the network in situ is in a dynamic state and undergoes a “breathing” action of tetramer dissociation and re-formation."
https://openalex.org/W1994824150,"For many G protein-coupled receptors, agonist-induced activation is followed by desensitization, internalization, and resensitization. In most cases, these processes are dependent upon interaction of agonist-occupied receptor with cytoplasmic β-arrestins. The ligand-induced intramolecular rearrangements of the receptor responsible for the desensitized versus active conformational states, which dictate both the pharmacological properties of ligands and the biological activity of G protein-coupled receptors, have not been fully elucidated. Here, we identify specific interactions between parathyroid hormone (PTH)-related protein and the human PTH type 1 receptor (PTH1Rc) and the related receptor conformational changes that lead to β-arrestin-2-mediated desensitization. PTH-related protein analogs modified at position 1 induced selective stabilization of the active G protein-coupled state of the receptor, resulting in lack of β-arrestin-2 recruitment to the cell membrane, sustained cAMP signaling, and absence of ligand-receptor complex internalization. Mechanistically, the ligands modified at position 1, interacting with the extracellular end of helix VI of PTH1Rc, produced a translocation of transmembrane helices V and VI that differed from that induced by the cognate agonist, resulting in significantly different conformations of the third intracellular loop. These results show how specific interactions between PTH1Rc and its ligands may stabilize distinct conformational states, representing either the active G protein-coupled or a desensitized β-arrestin-coupled receptor state.

The ligand-induced intracellular signaling of GPCRs is tightly regulated by several mechanisms. For numerous GPCRs, desensitization involves translocation of arrestins from the cytosol to the cell membrane, their direct interaction with agonist-activated GPCRs, and consequent inhibition of G protein coupling (1Pierce K.L. Lefkowitz R.J. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2001; 2: 727-733Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar, 2Ferguson S.S. Zhang J. Barak L.S Caron M.G. Life Sci. 1998; 62: 1561-1565Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). Additionally, arrestin-mediated internalization of agonist-receptor complexes through clathrin-coated vesicles and subsequent receptor recycling to the cell membrane are responsible for the recovery of cellular responsiveness to agonists (resensitization). Receptor desensitization and resensitization accomplish the fundamental physiological role of modulating the cellular responses to both acute and chronic stimulation. An important implication is that not only signal transduction per se, but also the mechanisms regulating signal transduction have a profound influence in determining the pathophysiological processes mediated by GPCRs. Many important questions remain regarding the relationship between receptor occupancy, signaling, and desensitization. In particular, the structural features that differentiate the active and desensitized states and how extracellular interactions with the ligand translate into intracellular events (such as G protein activation and interaction with arrestins) have not been fully characterized. Parathyroid hormone (PTH) is a major regulator of serum calcium homeostasis and bone metabolism (3Fitzpatrick L.A. Bilezikian J.P. Bilezikian J.P. Raisz L.G. Rodan G.A. Principles of Bone Biology. Academic Press, Inc., San Diego, CA1996: 339-346Google Scholar). PTH-related protein (PTHrP), first described as the hormone responsible for hypercalcemia of malignancy, is now recognized as an autocrine/paracrine factor with various biological functions in many tissues (4Strewler G.J. N. Engl. J. Med. 2000; 342: 177-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar). Both PTH and PTHrP bind to and activate the PTH type 1 receptor (PTH1Rc), a member of the class II subfamily of GPCRs coupled to both Gs and Gq proteins (5Abou-Samra A.B. Juppner H. Force T. Freeman M.W. Kong X. Schipani E. Urena P. Richards J. Bonventre J.V. Potts J.T. Kronenberg H.M. Segre G.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 2732-2736Crossref PubMed Scopus (989) Google Scholar). As for many other GPCRs, interaction of activated PTH1Rc with β-arrestin-2 is a primary mechanism for rapid desensitization of cAMP signaling and further internalization of ligand-receptor complexes (6Ferrari S.L. Behar V. Chorev M. Rosenblatt M. Bisello A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29968-29975Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 7Ferrari S.L. Bisello A. Mol. Endocrinol. 2001; 15: 149-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Several lines of evidence suggest that recruitment of β-arrestin-2 to the cell membrane and its association with activated PTH1Rc are largely (if not completely) independent of intracellular signaling and receptor phosphorylation (7Ferrari S.L. Bisello A. Mol. Endocrinol. 2001; 15: 149-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 8Malecz N. Bambino T. Bencsik M. Nissenson R.A. Mol.

Chem. 2001; 276: 33435-33443Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Therefore, the increased affinity of agonist-occupied PTH1Rc for β-arrestin-2 and the consequent reduction in coupling with G proteins may result from specific conformational states distinct from those of the active G protein-bound receptor. To characterize the specific interactions with agonists that stabilize these distinct functional states, we developed analogs of the biologically active N-terminal fragment of PTHrP (i.e.PTHrP-(1–36)) with selective pharmacological profiles. Analysis of the signaling properties of these analogs combined with fluorescence monitoring of the cellular distribution and extensive molecular modeling of the ligand-receptor complexes allowed us to identify specific interactions between ligand and receptor and the related conformational changes within PTH1Rc that are associated with β-arrestin-2-mediated desensitization. The synthesis, purification, and characterization of PTHrP-(1–34)-NH2 (PTHrP-(1–34)), PTHrP-(2–36)-NH2 (PTHrP-(2–36)), [Bpa1,Ile5,Arg11,13,Tyr36]PTHrP-(1–36)-NH2(Bpa1-PTHrP-(1–36)), [Bpa1,Ile5,Arg11,Lys13(N ε-5- carboxymethylrhodamine),Tyr36]PTHrP-(1–36)-NH2(Rho-Bpa1- PTHrP-(1–36)), bovine [Nle8,18,Tyr34]PTH-(1–34)-NH2(PTH-(1–34)), and bovine [Nle8,18,Lys13(N ε-5-carboxymethylrhodamine),l-2-Nal23, Arg26,27,Tyr34]PTH-(1–34)-NH2(Rho-PTH-(1–34)) were carried out as previously described (6Ferrari S.L. Behar V. Chorev M. Rosenblatt M. Bisello A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29968-29975Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). The pure products were characterized by analytical HPLC, electron spray mass spectrometry, and amino acid analysis. Radioiodination and HPLC purification of PTH-(1–34), PTHrP-(2–36), and Bpa1-PTHrP-(1–36) were carried out as reported (6Ferrari S.L. Behar V. Chorev M. Rosenblatt M. Bisello A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29968-29975Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Human embryonic kidney cells (HEK-293) and HEK-293 cells stably expressing human PTH1Rc (clone C-21) were cultured in Dulbecco's minimal essential medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum as described (10Pines M.

Cells were plated at 1.5 × 105 cells/coverslip on 35-mm glass coverslips for fluorescence microscopy experiments and at 1.0 × 105 cells/well in 24-well plastic dishes (Corning Inc., Corning, NY) for adenylyl cyclase, radioligand binding, and radioligand internalization assays and transfected as previously described (7Ferrari S.L. Bisello A. Mol. Endocrinol. 2001; 15: 149-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). All subsequent experiments were performed 24 h after transfection. Radioreceptor binding and internalization assays were carried out as reported (7Ferrari S.L. Bisello A. Mol. Endocrinol. 2001; 15: 149-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) using HPLC-purified radioiodinated compounds. The binding affinities (K d) of each PTHrP analog were calculated from Scatchard analysis of radioreceptor binding assays (using each radioiodinated compound as tracer and competition with each unlabeled analog) as described previously (6Ferrari S.L. Behar V. Chorev M. Rosenblatt M. Bisello A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29968-29975Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 7Ferrari S.L. Bisello A. Mol. Endocrinol. 2001; 15: 149-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). cAMP accumulation was determined in subconfluent cell cultures in the presence of the phosphodiesterase inhibitor 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine as previously described (7Ferrari S.L. Bisello A. Mol. Endocrinol. 2001; 15: 149-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Briefly, ligand-stimulated cAMP accumulation was measured in cells preincubated for 30 min with 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (1 mm) and subsequently exposed to various concentrations of the appropriate ligand (10−11 to 10−6m). To determine desensitization of cAMP signaling, cells were treated with the indicated ligands (100 nm) for 30 min, followed by a 2-h washout at 37 °C. Residual cAMP accumulation was then measured for 15 min in the presence of 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (1 mm). In all cases, reactions were stopped with 1.2m trichloroacetic acid, and cAMP was isolated by the two-column chromatographic method (11Salomon Y. Londos C. Rodbell M. Anal. Biochem. 1974; 58: 541-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (3367) Google Scholar). Transients of intracellular calcium stimulated by PTHrP-(1–36), PTHrP-(2–36), and Bpa1-PTHrP-(1–36) were assessed spectroscopically in Fura-2-loaded HEK-293 cells stably transfected with human PTH1Rc (clone C-21) as described (12Behar V. Pines M. Nakamoto C. Greenberg Z. Bisello A. Stueckle S.M. Bessalle R. Usdin T.B. Chorev M. Rosenblatt M. Suva L.J. Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 2748-2757Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Determination of total inositol phosphate accumulation was carried out essentially as described by John et al. (13John M.R. Bosel J. Breit S. Wickert H. Ziegler R. Blind E. Bone (Elmsford). 2001; 28: 182-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). Briefly, HEK-293 cells transiently expressing either wild-type PTH1Rc or PTH1Rc(H223R) were incubated overnight withmyo-[3H]inositol in Dulbecco's minimal essential medium and 0.1% bovine serum albumin. The medium was changed to medium containing 20 mm LiCl for 15 min, and cells were stimulated with 1 μm PTHrP-(1–36), PTHrP-(2–36), or Bpa1-PTHrP-(1–36) for 1 h at 37 °C. After aspiration of the medium, cells were lysed with 20 mmformic acid for 1 h on ice, and the neutralized supernatants were chromatographed on Dowex 1-X8 as described (13John M.R. Bosel J. Breit S. Wickert H. Ziegler R. Blind E. Bone (Elmsford). 2001; 28: 182-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). Cellular distribution of fluorescent ligands, receptor-green fluorescent protein (GFP) conjugate (PTH1Rc-GFP), and β-arrestin-2-GFP (β-arr2-GFP) was assessed by real-time fluorescence microscopy as previously described (7Ferrari S.L. Bisello A. Mol. Endocrinol. 2001; 15: 149-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Briefly, transfected cells grown on glass coverslips were rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline and mounted in an open-air, temperature-controlled block on a Nikon Diaphot 300®epifluorescence microscope. β-arr2-GFP or PTH1Rc-GFP distribution was first analyzed in the absence of ligand by monitoring the cells maintained in phosphate-buffered saline and 0.1% bovine serum albumin at 37 °C for up to 30 min. The effects of ligands on β-arr2-GFP or PTH1Rc-GFP localization were evaluated by subsequently adding the various ligands (100–1000 nm) in the same buffer and by monitoring redistribution of the green fluorescence over time. Dual fluorescence microscopy to colocalize β-arr2-GFP or PTH1Rc-GFP and rhodamine-labeled ligands was performed by preincubating cells with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and 1% bovine serum albumin (blocking of nonspecific binding), followed by incubation with the fluorescent ligand for 10 min on ice or at room temperature. The unbound ligand was then removed by carefully rinsing the coverslips with phosphate-buffered saline, and the cells were warmed to 37 °C for microscopy monitoring. Images of the distribution of β-arr2-GFP or PTH1Rc-GFP and rhodamine-labeled ligands were acquired sequentially,i.e. within a 10-s interval and in the same cellular plan, using fluorescein and rhodamine filters, respectively. Overlay images were generated using Image-Pro Plus® software (Media Cybernetics, Silver Spring, MD). The molecular dynamics simulations of the ligand-receptor complexes were carried out following published procedures (14Rolz C. Mierke D.F. Biophys. Chem. 2001; 89: 119-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 15Rolz C. Pellegrini M. Mierke D.F. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 6397-6405Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The starting structure, based on extensive NMR characterization of the ligands and extra- and intracellular portions of PTH1Rc, also includes ligand-receptor contact points derived from photoaffinity labeling experiments (16Behar V.

The simulations utilized a three-layer (water/decane/water) simulation cell, allowing for long simulations while maintaining the overall biphasic hydrophobic/hydrophilic character as well as the molecular motions of the long alkyl chains found in membranes (24van Buuren R.A. Marrink S. Berendsen H.J.C. J. Phys. Chem. 1993; 97: 9206-9216Crossref Scopus (369) Google Scholar). All simulations were performed using the GROMACS package (25van der Spoel D. Gromacs User Manual. University of Groningen, Groningen, The Netherlands1996Google Scholar). Analysis of motions of the transmembrane (TM) helices was carried out using the microdomain procedure described by Weinstein et al. (26Luo X. Zhang D. Weinstein H. Protein Eng. 1994; 7: 1441-1448Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), in which the receptor is defined as a set of domains. The rotation and translation of each domain during the simulation were then mapped upon the torques or forces exerted on the domain, clearly illustrating how interdomain interactions influence the motion of the domain. The structural consequences of the modified ligands, even if involving many sequential interactions, can be unambiguously identified. Comparisons between experimental groups were performed by two-factor analysis of variance using Statview® (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC). Residues 1 and 2 in PTHrP are essential for activation of receptor-mediated signaling (Ref. 27Chorev M. Rosenblatt M. Bilezikian J.P. Raisz L.G. Rodan G.A. Principles of Bone Biology. Academic Press, Inc., San Diego, CA1996: 305-323Google Scholar and references therein). Substitution of residue 2 (Val) in PTHrP with Bpa results in a ligand, [Bpa2,Ile5,Arg11,13]PTHrP-(1–36), with antagonist/inverse agonist properties (16Behar V. Bisello A. Bitan G. Rosenblatt M. Chorev M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9-17Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). In contrast, modification of residue 1 (Ala) in PTHrP-(1–36) by either deletion or substitution with Bpa (yielding PTHrP-(2–36) and Bpa1-PTHrP-(1–36), respectively) did not significantly alter the affinity for PTH1Rc or the efficacy in acutely stimulating the Gs/adenylyl cyclase signaling pathway in HEK-293 cells stably expressing human PTH1Rc (C-21 cells) (TableI). However, although PTH-(1–34) and PTHrP-(1–36) stimulated rapid and robust transient increases in intracellular calcium in C-21 cells, both PTHrP-(2–36) and Bpa1-PTHrP-(1–36) lost their ability to stimulate Gq/phospholipase C, as evidenced by both the absence of intracellular calcium transients upon stimulation of PTH1Rc in C-21 cells (Table I) as well as the lack of stimulation of phosphatidylinositol hydrolysis (see Fig. 3 C).Table ICharacterization of affinity and signaling properties of position 1-modified PTHrP analogs in HEK-293/C-21 cellsK d1-aBinding affinity (K d) was calculated from Scatchard analysis of radioreceptor binding assays (using each radioiodinated compound as tracer and competition with each unlabeled analog) performed in triplicate (6, 7).EC501-bEC50 was calculated from dose-response curves for cAMP accumulation.

In contrast to native PTHrP-(1–36) and PTH-(1–34) (6Ferrari S.L. Behar V. Chorev M. Rosenblatt M. Bisello A. J. Biol.

Furthermore, a rhodamine-labeled Bpa1-PTHrP-(1–36) analog that bound to PTH1Rc on the cell membrane did not colocalize with β-arr2-GFP on the cell surface or intracellularly (Fig. 2 A). Rapid receptor internalization did not occur in response to the modified PTHrP analogs in cells expressing PTH1Rc-GFP (data not shown) (29Zhang P. Jobert A.S. Couvineau A. Silve C. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1998; 83: 3365-3368Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and Bpa1-PTHrP-(1–36)-receptor complexes were not detectable intracellularly (Fig. 2 B). These results, distinct from those obtained with the full-length agonists PTH-(1–34) and PTHrP-(1–36) (Fig. 2, A and B) (6Ferrari S.L. Behar V. Chorev M. Rosenblatt M. Bisello A. J. Biol.

After 15 min at 37 °C, Rho-Bpa1-PTHrP-(1–36) appeared bound on the cell surface without evidence of internalization (panel a); β-arr2-GFP was not recruited to the cell surface (panel b); and therefore, the two fluorescences did not colocalize on the overlay image (panel c). In contrast, after stimulation with Rho-PTH-(1–34), both ligand (panel d) and β-arr2-GFP (panel e) colocalized intracellularly (panel f).

After 15 min at 37 °C, Rho-Bpa1-PTHrP-(1–36) was linearly distributed on the cell surface (panel a); PTH1Rc-GFP was mostly localized on the cell surface (panel b); and therefore, both ligand and receptor colocalized (in orange-yellow in the overlay image) (panel c). In contrast, in response to Rho-PTH-(1–34), both ligand (panel d) and receptor (panel e) were internalized and colocalized in the cytoplasm (panel e). Each panel is representative of three to seven independent experiments yielding similar results.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To quantify and confirm these observations, the distribution of radioiodinated PTH-(1–34), PTHrP-(2–36), and Bpa1-PTHrP-(1–36) was monitored (Fig.3 A);125I-PTH-(1–34) was rapidly (t½=10min) and efficiently internalized in C-21 cells, whereas internalization of 125I-Bpa1-PTHrP-(1–36) and125I-PTHrP-(2–36) was slower (t (t½=30min) and only partial. In addition, the dissociation of receptor-bound125I-Bpa1-PTHrP-(1–36) and125I-PTHrP-(2–36) (14 ± 1 and 16 ± 2% at 60 min, respectively) was lower than that of 125I-PTH-(1–34) (26 ± 6% at 60 min), in agreement with the proposed “pseudo-irreversible” binding of agonist to receptor-G protein complexes (30Hoare S.R. Gardella T.J. Usdin T.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 7741-7753Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). As a consequence, 1 h after extensive washout, both Bpa1-PTHrP-(1–36) and PTHrP-(2–36) remained mostly associated with PTH1Rc on the cell membrane (47 ± 5 and 61 ± 3% of total bound ligand, respectively), whereas only 10 ± 1% of PTH-(1–34) was still associated with membrane receptors. Because receptor interaction with β-arrestin-2 is an essential early step in rapid desensitization of Gs/cAMP signaling by PTH1Rc (7Ferrari S.L. Bisello A. Mol. Endocrinol. 2001; 15: 149-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), we hypothesized that Bpa1-PTHrP-(1–36) and PTHrP-(2–36) would induce sustained activation of adenylyl cyclase. Indeed, exposure of HEK cells expressing PTH1Rc either stably (C-21) or transiently to Bpa1-PTHrP-(1–3"

Here we investigated the involvement of caspase- and Bcl-2-dependent pathways in doxorubicin-induced mitochondrial perturbations and apoptosis. For this purpose, we set up a novel three-color flow cytometric assay using rhodamine 123, annexin V-allophycocyanin, and propidium iodide to assess the involvement of the mitochondria in apoptosis caused by doxorubicin in the breast cancer cell line MTLn3. Doxorubicin-induced apoptosis was preceded by up-regulation of CD95 and CD95L and a collapse of mitochondrial membrane potential (Δψ) occurring prior to phosphatidylserine externalization. This drop in Δψ was independent of caspase activity, since benzyloxycarbonyl-Val-Ala-dl-Asp-fluoromethylketone did not inhibit it. Benzyloxycarbonyl-Val-Ala-dl-Asp-fluoromethylketone also blocked activation of caspase-8, thus excluding an involvement of the death receptor pathway in Δψ dissipation. Furthermore, although overexpression of Bcl-2 in MTLn3 cells inhibited apoptosis, dissipation of Δψ was still observed. No decrease in Δψ was observed in cells undergoing etoposide-induced apoptosis. Immunofluorescent analysis of Δψ and cytochrome c localization on a cell-to-cell basis indicates that the collapse of Δψ and cytochromec release are mutually independent in both normal and Bcl-2-overexpressing cells. Together, these data indicate that doxorubicin-induced dissipation of the mitochondrial membrane potential precedes phosphatidylserine externalization and is independent of a caspase- or Bcl-2-controlled checkpoint.

Stepczynska A. Stroh C. Lauber K. Berg C. Schwenzer R. Wajant H. Janicke R.U. Porter A.G. Belka C. Gregor M. Schulze-Osthoff K. Wesselborg S.

The mechanisms regulating the release of cytochrome c include specific pore formation in the outer mitochondrial membrane and opening of the permeability transition pore (reviewed in Ref. 5Harris M.H. Thompson C.B. Cell Death Differ. 2000; 7: 1182-1191Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar). As a consequence of both the loss of the electrochemical gradient caused by pore opening and rupture of the outer mitochondrial membrane, the mitochondrial membrane potential (Δψ)1 generally collapses. There is general agreement that cytosolic cytochromec interacts with Apaf-1, ATP, and procaspase-9, resulting in the activation of the latter, followed by caspase-3 activation and initiation of a proteolytic cascade (6Li P. Nijhawan D. Budihardjo I. Srinivasula S.M. Ahmad M. Alnemri E.S. Wang X. Cell. 1997; 91: 479-489Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6259) Google Scholar). However, the exact sequence of events resulting in disruption of mitochondrial function and release of cytochrome c from the mitochondria in apoptosis caused by anticancer drugs is not yet clear. There are two prominent pathways that may cause mitochondrial dysfunction during apoptosis. First, death receptor activation through CD95/CD95L and caspase-8 activation during apoptosis is under several circumstances upstream from mitochondrial perturbations. Thus, active caspase-8 may cause cleavage of the proapoptotic Bcl-2 member Bid and, as a consequence, mitochondrial dysfunction (7Li H. Zhu H., Xu, C.J. Yuan J. Cell. 1998; 94: 491-501Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3798) Google Scholar, 8Luo X. Budihardjo I. Zou H. Slaughter C. Wang X.

Cell Death Differ. 2000; 7: 556-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). Several anticancer agents, including doxorubicin and etoposide, can up-regulate CD95 and CD95L (10Friesen C. Herr I. Krammer P.H. Debatin K.M. Nat. Med. 1996; 2: 574-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (958) Google Scholar, 11Fulda S. Sieverts H. Friesen C. Herr I. Debatin K.M. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 3823-3829PubMed Google Scholar, 12Kaufmann S.H. Earnshaw W.C. Exp. Cell Res. 2000; 256: 42-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (1071) Google Scholar). However, there is controversy on the relative importance of this pathway in anticancer drug-induced mitochondrial perturbations and apoptosis. Thus, in some cell types, inhibition of this pathway using either Fas-linked interleukin-β-converting enzyme inhibitory protein, CrmA, or dominant negative Fas-associated death domain abrogates apoptosis, whereas in other cell types little effect was observed (reviewed in Ref. 12Kaufmann S.H. Earnshaw W.C. Exp. Cell Res. 2000; 256: 42-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (1071) Google Scholar). Although up-regulation of death receptor pathway components was found in some solid tumor cell lines, the extent of subsequent involvement of the mitochondrial pathway remains unclear (11Fulda S. Sieverts H. Friesen C. Herr I. Debatin K.M. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 3823-3829PubMed Google Scholar, 13Fulda S. Los M. Friesen C. Debatin K.M. Int. J. Cancer. 1998; 76: 105-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Up-regulation and/or translocation of Bax and/or other proapoptotic Bcl-2 family members to the mitochondria is a second major pathway for mitochondrial perturbation preceding the onset of apoptosis. At the mitochondria, Bax invokes cytochrome crelease and loss of Δψ (14Gross A. Jockel J. Wei M.C. Korsmeyer S.J. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3878-3885Crossref PubMed Scopus (968) Google Scholar), possibly via direct pore formation (15Schlesinger P.H. Gross A. Yin X.M. Yamamoto K. Saito M. Waksman G. Korsmeyer S.J. Proc.

Cell Death Differ. 2000; 7: 1174-1181Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar, 18Shimizu S. Narita M. Tsujimoto Y. Nature. 1999; 399: 483-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (1928) Google Scholar). Importantly, the antiapoptotic Bcl-2 family members Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL generally inhibit these mitochondrial perturbations (19Vander Heiden M.G. Thompson C.B. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: E209-E216Crossref PubMed Scopus (602) Google Scholar, 20Green D.R. Reed J.C. Science. 1998; 281: 1309-1312Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Various tumor cells have increased expression of proteins that inhibit either the death receptor pathways (e.g. Fas-linked interleukin-β-converting enzyme inhibitory protein) or apoptosis caused by Bax (e.g. Bcl-2 or Bcl-xL) (21Bullani R.R.

These tumor cells are generally more resistant to anticancer drug-induced apoptosis. It is unclear whether such resistance includes mitochondrial protection. Therefore, we have investigated the relative roles of caspase activation and Bcl-2-dependent pathways in mitochondrial perturbations and apoptosis caused by the anticancer drug doxorubicin. Doxorubicin is often used in the treatment of solid tumors, including breast, liver, and bone tumors (26Hortobagyi G.N. Drugs. 1997; 54 Suppl. 4: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (620) Google Scholar). It causes DNA damage and formation of reactive oxygen species, eventually resulting in apoptosis (27Gewirtz D.A. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1999; 57: 727-741Crossref PubMed Scopus (1832) Google Scholar). Although doxorubicin causes mitochondrial injury in cardiac muscle cells (28Gille L. Nohl H. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1997; 23: 775-782Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar) and some other cell types, these effects were studied primarily in lymphoid cells (29Gamen S. Anel A. Perez-Galan P. Lasierra P. Johnson D. Pineiro A. Naval J. Exp. Cell Res. 2000; 258: 223-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 30Decaudin D. Geley S. Hirsch T. Castedo M. Marchetti P. Macho A. Kofler R. Kroemer G. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 62-67PubMed Google Scholar). The molecular mechanism of mitochondrial injury and its role in the induction of apoptosis in adenocarcinoma cells remains, however, largely unclear. As discussed above, the dissipation of Δψ is one of the markers for mitochondrial involvement in apoptosis. So far, dissipation of Δψ caused by doxorubicin has been determined either in the total cell population (30Decaudin D. Geley S. Hirsch T. Castedo M. Marchetti P. Macho A. Kofler R. Kroemer G. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 62-67PubMed Google Scholar, 31Fulda S. Susin S.A. Kroemer G. Debatin K.M. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 4453-4460PubMed Google Scholar, 32Bossy-Wetzel E. Newmeyer D.D. Green D.R. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 37-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (1107) Google Scholar) or in “viable” cells based on scatter properties (33Denecker G. Dooms H. Van Loo G. Vercammen D. Grooten J. Fiers W. Declercq W. Vandenabeele P. FEBS Lett. 2000; 465: 47-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). These methods do not allow proper distinction of the exact cell population in which the changes in Δψ occurred: genuinely viable, apoptotic or (secondary) necrotic cells. As a consequence, the identification of the exact sequence of events in doxorubicin-induced apoptosis was precluded. In the present study, we set up three-color flow cytometry with rhodamine 123, annexin V-allophycocyanin (APC), and propidium iodide to assess the involvement of the mitochondria in doxorubicin-induced apoptosis. For this purpose, we used the rat mammary adenocarcinoma cell line MTLn3, which is often used as a model to study molecular mechanisms of metastasis formation (34Welch D.R. Neri A. Nicolson G.L. Invasion Metastasis. 1983; 3: 65-80PubMed Google Scholar, 35Kiley S.C. Clark K.J. Goodnough M. Welch D.R. Jaken S. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 3230-3238PubMed Google Scholar) and responses to drug therapy both in vitro andin vivo (36Toyota N. Strebel F.R. Stephens L.C. Matsuda H. Oshiro T. Jenkins G.N. Bull J.M. Int. J. Cancer. 1998; 76: 499-505Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 37Kakeji Y. Maehara Y. Ikebe M. Teicher B.A. Int. J. Radiat. Oncol. Biol.

Pharmacol. 2001; 62: 1087-1097Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). We have previously characterized in detail the induction of apoptosis by anticancer drugs in these cells (38Huigsloot M. Tijdens I.B. Mulder G.J. van de Water B. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2001; 62: 1087-1097Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). In the present study, we show that the doxorubicin-mediated collapse of Δψ is a primary event preceding PS externalization. Moreover, despite the fact that doxorubicin causes up-regulation of CD95 and CD95L, prevention of caspase-8 activation does not prevent loss of Δψ. Furthermore, although Bcl-2 inhibits apoptosis, dissipation of Δψ is still observed. Analysis of Δψ and cytochromec localization on a cell-to-cell basis indicates that the collapse of Δψ and cytochrome c release are mutually independent in both normal and Bcl-2-overexpressing cells. Together, these data indicate that doxorubicin-induced dissipation of the mitochondrial membrane potential precedes PS externalization and is independent of a caspase- or Bcl-2-controlled checkpoint. α-Modified minimal essential medium with ribonucleosides and deoxyribonucleosides (α-MEM), fetal bovine serum (FBS), penicillin/streptomycin, LipofectAMINE Plus, and Geneticin (G418 sulfate) were from Invitrogen. Collagen (type I, rat tail) was from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. (Lake Placid, NY). Doxorubicin, propidium iodide (PI), 7-amino-4-methylcoumarin (AMC), DiOC6, rhodamine 123, and RNase A were from Sigma. Benzyloxycarbonyl-Val-Ala-dl-Asp-fluoromethylketone (zVAD-fmk) and acetyl-Asp-Glu-Val-Asp-7-amino-4-methylcoumarin were from Bachem (Bubendorf, Switzerland). Annexin V was from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. Hoechst 33258, the AlexaTM 488 protein labeling kit, and MitotrackerTM Red CMXRos were from Molecular Probes (Leiden, The Netherlands). APC was from Prozyme (San Leandro, CA). All other chemicals were of analytical grade. MTLn3 rat mammary adenocarcinoma cells were originally developed by Dr. D. R. Welch (Jake Gittlen Cancer Research Institute, The Pennsylvania State University College of Medicine, Hershey, PA) and used between passages 46 and 56. They were cultured in α-MEM supplemented with 5% (v/v) FBS (complete medium). For experiments, cells were plated at a density of 4 × 103 cells/cm2 in Corning plates (Acton, MA) and grown for 3 days in complete medium supplemented with 50 units of penicillin/liter and 50 mg of streptomycin/liter (penicillin/streptomycin). Cells were exposed to doxorubicin for 1 h in Hanks' balanced salt solution (137 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 0.8 mmMgSO4·7H2O, 0.4 mmNa2HPO4·2H2O, 0.4 mmKH2PO4, 1.3 mm CaCl2, 4 mm NaHCO3, 25 mm HEPES, 5 mmd-glucose, pH 7.4). After removal of doxorubicin, cells were recovered in α-MEM containing 2.5% (v/v) FBS and penicillin/streptomycin for the indicated periods. In some experiments, cells were recovered in α-MEM containing 2.5% (v/v) FBS, penicillin/streptomycin and 100 μm zVAD-fmk. Subconfluent MTLn3 cells were transfected with pcDNA3 (Neo) or pcDNA3 containing human Bcl-2 (gift from Dr. James L. Stevens) using LipofectAMINE Plus reagent, and after reaching confluence they were selected for neomycin resistance (G418; 100 μg/ml). For both vectors, three clones were selected and used for up to six passages, during which they stably expressed Bcl-2 in over 95% of cells based on immunofluorescence. In some experiments, we used porcine renal proximal tubular cell line LLC-PK1 expressing either Bcl-2 (pkBCL-2 clone 6) or the empty vector (pkNEO clone 1) that have been described previously (39Zhan Y. van de Water B. Wang Y. Stevens J.L. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6505-6512Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). LLC-PK1 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% (v/v) FBS and penicillin/streptomycin. For experiments, cells were plated overnight in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium plus penicillin/streptomycin without FBS on collagen-coated 6-cm culture dishes to form a subconfluent monolayer as described previously (40van de Water B. Houtepen F. Huigsloot M. Tijdens I.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 36183-36193Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Thereafter, cells were treated with varying concentrations of doxorubicin in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/penicillin/streptomycin for 24 h. For annexin V/propidium iodide (AV/PI) staining, cells were washed twice in PBS (137 mmNaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 4.3 mmNa2HPO4·2H2O, 1.4 mmKH2PO4, pH 7.4) containing 1 mmEDTA (PBS-EDTA) and subsequently trypsinized with 0.13 g/liter trypsin in PBS-EDTA. Medium, washes, and cells were combined and centrifuged (5 min, 200 × g, 4 °C), and the pellet was washed once with PBS-EDTA. Cells were allowed to recover from trypsinization in complete medium (30 min, 37 °C). Externalized phosphatidylserine (PS) was labeled (15 min, 0 °C) with AlexaTM488-conjugated annexin V in AV buffer (10 mm HEPES, 145 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1.0 mmMgCl2·6H2O, 1.8 mmCaCl2·2H2O, pH 7.4). Propidium iodide (2 μm) in AV buffer was added 1 min prior to analysis on a FACScalibur flow cytometer (BD PharMingen). For cell cycle analysis, trypsinized and floating cells were pooled, washed with PBS-EDTA, and fixated in 70% (v/v) ethanol (30 min, −20 °C). After two washes with PBS-EDTA, cells were incubated with PBS-EDTA containing 50 μg/ml RNase A and 7.5 μm PI (45 min, room temperature) and subsequently analyzed by flow cytometry. Caspase-3-like activity was determined as described previously (38Huigsloot M. Tijdens I.B. Mulder G.J. van de Water B. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2001; 62: 1087-1097Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were trypsinized as described for AV/PI, washed once in PBS-EDTA, and resuspended in lysis buffer (10 mm HEPES, 40 mm β-glycerophosphate, 50 mm NaCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 5 mm EGTA, pH 7.0). Cells were lysed by four cycles of freezing and thawing followed by centrifugation (30 min, 13,000 × g, 4 °C). To 10 μg of cell lysate protein, 80 μl assay buffer was added (100 mm HEPES, 10% (w/v) sucrose, 0.1% (v/v) Nonidet P40, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 25 μmacetyl-Asp-Glu-Val-Asp-7-amino-4-methylcoumarin, pH 7.25), and the release of AMC was monitored (45 min, 37 °C) in a fluorescence plate reader (HTS 7000 bioassay reader; PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Free AMC was used as a standard, and caspase activity was expressed as pmol of AMC/min/mg of protein. Mitochondrial membrane potential was essentially performed as described before (41van de Water B.

Following recovery in complete medium, cells were incubated with 1 μm rhodamine 123 (Rho123) and APC-conjugated annexin V (43Hardy R.R. Weir D.M. Herzenberg L.A. Blackwell C. Purification and Coupling of Fluorescent Proteins for Use in Flow Cytometry. Blackwell Scientific Publications, Boston1986: 31.1-31.12Google Scholar) in AV buffer (30 min, 37 °C). Cells were centrifuged (30 s, 400 × g, room temperature), and the pellet was resuspended in AV buffer containing 2 μm propidium iodide 1 min prior to analysis by confocal laser-scanning microscopy (CLSM; Bio-Rad) or flow cytometry. As an alternative method to determine the mitochondrial membrane potential, we used DiOC6 (0.1 μm) instead of Rho123 (30Decaudin D. Geley S. Hirsch T. Castedo M. Marchetti P. Macho A. Kofler R. Kroemer G. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 62-67PubMed Google Scholar, 44Finucane D.M. Waterhouse N.J. Amarante-Mendes G.P. Cotter T.G. Green D.R. Exp.

Biochem. 1990; 194: 389-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). Selective localization of DiOC6 at the mitochondria was confirmed by CLSM. MTLn3 Neo and Bcl-2 cells were treated with varying concentrations of doxorubicin as described above. After 24 h, cells were trypsinized, and viable cells (trypan blue exclusion) were counted. Next, 12,500 cells were plated in 1 ml of top agar (0.33% (w/v) agarose in complete medium in the presence of amphotericin B (250 ng/ml)) on top of 2.5 ml of bottom agar (0.66% (w/v) agarose in complete medium in the presence of amphotericin B (250 ng/ml)) in duplicate in six-well plates, as described by Kiley et al. (35Kiley S.C. Clark K.J. Goodnough M. Welch D.R. Jaken S. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 3230-3238PubMed Google Scholar). After 1 week, a top layer of 2.5 ml of bottom agar was added. After 14 days, 150 μl of a 5 μg/ml 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide solution in medium was added to the wells, and after overnight incubation (37 °C), digital images of the wells were taken with a Nikon CCD camera. Colonies were counted using a particle-counting option in Image Pro (Media Cybernetics, Silver Spring, MD). Attached cells were scraped in ice-cold TSE+ (10 mm Tris-HCl, 250 mm sucrose, 1 mm EGTA, pH 7.4, containing 1 mmdithiothreitol, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 mm sodium vanadate, 50 mm sodium fluoride, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Floating cells in the medium and in one wash of PBS were pelleted (5 min, 200 ×g, 4 °C) and pooled with scraped cells in TSE+. The protein concentration in the supernatant was determined using the Bio-Rad protein assay using IgG as a standard. Fifteen μg of total cellular protein was separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore Corp., Etten Leur, The Netherlands). Blots were blocked with 5% (w/v) nonfat dry milk in TBS-T (0.5 m NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, 0.05% (v/v) Tween 20, pH 7.4) and probed for Bcl-2 (C-2; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA), p53 (polyclonal antibody 240; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), CD95 (FL335; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), CD95L (clone 33; Transduction Laboratories), caspase-8 (kindly provided by Prof. J.

Cytosolic fractions were prepared as described by Boesen-de Cock (46Boesen-de Cock J.G. Tepper A.D. de Vries E. van Blitterswijk W.J. Borst J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 14255-14261Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Briefly, floating cells in the medium and one wash of mitobuffer (50 mm PIPES-KOH (pH 7.4), 220 mmmannitol, 68 mm sucrose, 50 mm KCl, 5 mm EGTA, 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) were pelleted (5 min, 200 × g, 4 °C) and pooled with attached cells scraped in 100 μl of ice-cold mitobuffer. Cells were pelleted (1 min, 400 × g, room temperature), resuspended in 100 μl of mitobuffer, and allowed to swell on ice for 30 min. Cells were homogenized by passing the suspension through a 25-gauge needle (10 strokes). Homogenates were centrifuged (15 min, 13,000 × g, 4 °C), and supernatants were collected. Thirty μg of cytosolic protein was separated on a 15% SDS-PAGE gel and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. Cytochrome c was detected with anti-cytochrome c monoclonal antibody (7H8.2C12; BD PharMingen) using the Western Star kit (Tropix, Bedford, MA). Cells were cultured on 12-mm collagen-coated glass coverslips and fixated in fresh 4% (w/v) paraformaldehyde in PBS. Coverslips were blocked in TBP (0.5% (w/v) bovine serum albumin and 0.05% (v/v) Tween 20 in PBS, pH 7.4) (1 h, room temperature) and subsequently incubated with primary antibody in TBP (1 h, room temperature). Coverslips were washed twice in PBS containing 0.05% Tween 20 and incubated with AlexaTM 488-, Cy3- or Cy5-conjugated secondary antibodies in TBP (45 min, room temperature). After washing, coverslips were incubated with 2 μg/ml Hoechst 33258 in PBS (15 min, room temperature), washed in PBS, and mounted in Aqua PolyMount (Polysciences, Warrington, PA). In some experiments, cells were incubated with 200 nm MitoTracker Red CMXRos in complete medium (15 min, 37 °C) prior to fixation. Primary antibodies used were Bcl-2 (C-2; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and cytochrome c (6H2B4; BD PharMingen). Imaging occurred by confocal laser-scanning microscopy (Bio-Rad). Student's t test was used to determine whether there was a significant difference between two means (p < 0.05). When multiple means were compared, significance was determined by one-way analysis of variance (p < 0.05). For analysis of variance analysis, letter designations are used to indicate statistically significant differences. Means with a common letter designation within onefigure are not different; those with a different letter designation are significantly different from all other means with different letter designations. For example, a mean designated asa is significantly different from a mean designatedb, but neither is different from a mean designateda,b. The mitochondria are key organelles in the control of apoptosis. Therefore, we investigated the involvement of mitochondrial dysfunction in doxorubicin-induced apoptosis. The Δψ is a sensitive measure for mitochondrial functioning (reviewed by Kroemer and Reed (49Kroemer G. Reed J.C. Nat. Med. 2000; 6: 513-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (2785) Google Scholar)). Previously, we reported on the apoptotic effects of doxorubicin on MTLn3 cells (38Huigsloot M. Tijdens I.B. Mulder G.J. van de Water B. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2001; 62: 1087-1097Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Doxorubicin induced apoptosis in a time-dependent manner, as determined by annexin V-staining, analysis of DNA content, and caspase activity. The onset of apoptosis occurred between 8 and 16 h after exposure, with maximal caspase-3 activity at 24 h. In the present study, we analyzed Δψ after doxorubicin treatment by flow cytometry using Rho123. Initially, Rho123 fluorescence was only quantified in the PI (i.e. viable) population, gated as indicated in Fig. 1 A. Doxorubicin caused a decrease in Δψ in PI− cells (Fig.1 B). PI− cells, however, include two cell populations: genuinely viable cells as well as early apoptotic cells. These cells can be distinguished by the absence or presence of externalized PS (viable and apoptotic cells, respectively) as identified by annexin V staining. Therefore, the possibility existed that the drop in Δψ was mainly present in cells that were already apoptotic (i.e. have externalized PS). Alternatively, apoptotic cells may have a disturbed intracellular distribution of Rho123 that does not reflect the mitochondrial membrane potential. To investigate these possibilities in more detail, MTLn3 cells were stained with Rho123 and propidium iodide as well as APC-labeled AV. This enabled us to determine the relationship between loss of Δψ and onset of apoptosis in PI− cells. Using CLSM (Fig.2), we observed that in control cells, the Rho123 staining is intense and strictly located at the mitochondria; little variability is observed between cells (A–C). In contrast, in doxorubicin-treated cells, there is considerable variability in Rho123 staining (G–I). Thus, whereas in all AV−/PI− cells Rho123 is located at mitochondria, some of these cells have a markedly decreased Δψ. In contrast, in AV+/PI− cells the Rho123 staining is more diff"

These receptors are internalized by a clathrin-mediated pathway; however, a motif that is necessary for endocytosis of ionotropic receptors has not yet been identified. Here, we identified a motif that is required for constitutive and agonist-regulated internalization of the ionotropic P2X4 receptor. Three amino acids in the C terminus of P2X4 (Tyr378, Gly381, and Leu382) compose a non-canonical tyrosine-based sorting signal of the form YXXGL. We found that P2X4 protein was present in clathrin-coated vesicles isolated from rat brain and that a glutathioneS-transferase fusion of the P2X4 C terminus pulled down the adaptor protein-2 complex from brain extract. Mutation of either the tyrosine-binding pocket of the μ2 subunit of adaptor protein-2 or the YXXGL motif in the receptor C terminus caused a decrease in receptor internalization and a dramatic increase in the surface expression of P2X4 receptors. The YXXGL motif represents a non-canonical tyrosine-based sorting signal that is necessary for efficient endocytosis of the P2X4 receptor.

Similar motifs are present in other receptors and may be important for the control of their functional expression. A cell can sense extracellular stimuli by using receptors at the surface to transduce these messages into electrical or chemical signals. An emerging picture for ionotropic receptors is that rapid modulation of their surface number can control the response to a given stimulus. This is of considerable interest because, for ionotropic receptors in synaptic membranes, this may underlie the changes in synaptic strength observed during long-term potentiation and depression (1Carroll R.C.

Constitutive endocytosis and recycling of ionotropic receptors are likely to be essential for rapid modulation of surface receptor number because, by changing the relative rates of receptor internalization and insertion, the cell can alter the receptor density (4Turrigiano G.G.

The mechanism of internalization of transmembrane proteins by clathrin-mediated endocytosis is well established. Proteins destined for internalization are concentrated in clathrin-coated pits before being “pinched off” to form an endocytic vesicle (9Marsh M. McMahon H.T. Science. 1999; 285: 215-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar). Most cargo proteins are recruited to coated pits via an interaction with their intracellular domains and adaptor protein-2 (AP-2). These interactions typically involve tyrosine-based sorting signals in the intracellular domain of the cargo protein and the medium (μ2) subunit of AP-2 (10Kirchhausen T. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; 15: 705-732Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar). Generally, tyrosine-based signals are of the form NPXY or YXXØ (where X is any amino acid and Ø is an amino acid with a bulky hydrophobic side chain) (11Bonifacino J.S. Dell'Angelica E.C. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 923-926Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar). YXXØ signals bind to μ2 in an extended conformation, with the Tyr and Ø residues fitting into two hydrophobic pockets in subdomain A of μ2 (12Owen D.J. Evans P.R. Science. 1998; 282: 1327-1332Crossref PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar). The mechanism of constitutive internalization of ionotropic receptors in neurons is thought to be similar to classical clathrin-mediated endocytosis in being dependent on both clathrin and dynamin (6Man H.Y.

Neuron. 2000; 25: 635-647Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar). Other molecular details of this process are less clear, however. For example, do recycling ionotropic receptors link to the endocytic pathway via canonical YXXØ motifs? Regions of the AMPA receptor protein that are important for endocytosis have been identified (14Lin J.W., Ju, W. Foster K. Lee S.H. Ahmadian G. Wyszynski M. Wang Y.T. Sheng M. Nat. Neurosci. 2000; 3: 1282-1290Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar), and an interaction with AP-2 has been shown for both AMPA and γ-aminobutyric acid type A receptors (6Man H.Y.

Jovanovic J.N. Brown D.A. Smart T.G. Moss S.J. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 7972-7977Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, endocytic motifs for these receptors have not yet been described (2Sheng M. Lee S.H. Cell. 2001; 105: 825-828Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). A canonical tyrosine-based sorting motif was identified for theN-methyl-d-aspartic acid receptor (16Roche K.W. Standley S. McCallum J. Dune Ly C. Ehlers M.D. Wenthold R.J. Nat. Neurosci. 2001; 4: 794-802Crossref PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar), but this receptor does not constitutively internalize in mature neurons (14Lin J.W., Ju, W. Foster K. Lee S.H. Ahmadian G. Wyszynski M. Wang Y.T. Sheng M. Nat. Neurosci. 2000; 3: 1282-1290Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar, 17Ehlers M.D. Neuron. 2000; 28: 511-525Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (900) Google Scholar). The purpose of this study therefore was to analyze how a recycling ionotropic receptor links to the endocytic pathway. P2X receptors are ionotropic receptors activated by extracellular ATP (18Khakh B.S. Burnstock G. Kennedy C. King B.F. North R.A. Seguela P. Voigt M. Humphrey P.P. Pharmacol. Rev. 2001; 53: 107-118PubMed Google Scholar). Previously, we have shown that P2X receptor trafficking is subunit-specific (7Bobanovic L.K. Royle S.J. Murrell-Lagnado R.D. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 4814-4824Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). P2X4 receptors are rapidly cycled between the plasma membrane and endosomal compartments. P2X2 receptors are, by contrast, stably expressed at the surface. Herein, we describe the endocytic motif of the P2X4 receptor. We found that it is a novel non-canonical tyrosine-based sorting signal. Mutation of the motif caused an inhibition of both constitutive and agonist-regulated endocytosis of the receptor, confirming a common mechanism for these pathways. Perturbation of P2X4 receptor endocytosis resulted in a large increase in the pool of functional receptors at the cell surface. Similar motifs are found in other receptor proteins, suggesting that this motif may be important for the constitutive internalization and modulation of the surface number of other receptor and ion channel types. The construction of enhanced green fluorescent protein (GFP)- and epitope-tagged P2X4 and P2X2 receptors has been described previously (7Bobanovic L.K. Royle S.J. Murrell-Lagnado R.D. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 4814-4824Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Chimeric receptors and point mutations in P2X4 were made by two-step PCR using GFP-tagged receptors as a template. For expression of either wild-type or epitope-tagged P2X receptors, the coding sequences of P2X4-GFP constructs were amplified to reintroduce the stop codon and an XbaI site. The subcloning of these fragments into wild-type or epitope-tagged P2X4 constructs excised the coding sequence of GFP. The sites of crossover for P2X4(2C) and P2X2(4C) receptors were Leu358–Thr354 and Leu353–Tyr359, respectively. Deletion constructs were made by PCR. The first residues following the starting methionine were Val7 and Asp16 for NΔ5 and NΔ14, respectively. For CΔ28, CΔ14, and CΔ7, the final residues before the linker between the receptor and GFP were Cys360, Tyr374, and Gly381, respectively. In the case of CΔ7, Leu382 was effectively replaced by proline in the linker region, and no significant change in trafficking was observed when compared with wild-type P2X4-GFP. Rat μ2 (AP50) cDNA in pGAD424, a kind gift of Dr. M. S. Robinson (Cambridge Institute of Medical Research, Cambridge, UK), was amplified and subcloned into pcDNA3.1 atHindIII and XbaI sites. The dominant-negative μ2 subunit was made by sequentially mutating D176A and W421A using two-step PCR (19Nesterov A. Carter R.E. Sorkina T. Gill G.N. Sorkin A. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2489-2499Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). For expression of a fusion protein of glutathioneS-transferase (GST) with the C terminus of P2X4(GST-4C), the C-terminal region of P2X4 was amplified by PCR and subcloned into pGEX-2T at BamHI and EcoRI sites. The sequences of all amplified regions were verified by automated DNA sequencing. 2The sequences of all oligonucleotide primers used are available upon request. Primary cultures of olfactory bulb neurons were prepared from 3–4-day-old Wistar rats using a modified method for culturing hippocampal neurons (7Bobanovic L.K. Royle S.J. Murrell-Lagnado R.D. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 4814-4824Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 20Koizumi S. Bootman M.D. Bobanoviæ L.K. Schell M.J. Berridge M.J. Lipp P. Neuron. 1999; 22: 125-137Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Human embryonic kidney 293 (HEK293) cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/nutrient mixture F-12 containing 10% fetal bovine serum and 100 units/ml penicillin/streptomycin at 37 °C and 5% CO2. HEK293 cells stably transfected with μ2 constructs were cultured in the same medium supplemented with 0.6 mg/ml Geneticin sulfate (G418). Olfactory bulb neurons were transfected at 10–21 days in vitro using a modified calcium phosphate method (7Bobanovic L.K. Royle S.J. Murrell-Lagnado R.D. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 4814-4824Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). HEK293 cells were plated onto poly-d-lysine-treated coverslips and transiently transfected 12 h later using the same method with slight modifications. The amount of DNA used to form a precipitate was 3 μg (in 100 μl of CaCl2/100 μl of 2× HEPES-buffered saline), and cells were kept with the precipitate for 6 h. For stable transfection, HEK293 cells were transfected using the calcium phosphate method. Culture medium containing G418 was added 24 h later, and stable cell lines contained a pool of resistant colonies. Standard whole-cell recordings (21Hamill O.P. Marty A. Neher E. Sakmann B. Sigworth F.J. Pfluegers Arch. 1981; 391: 85-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (15148) Google Scholar) were performed at room temperature using an Axopatch 200A amplifier (Axon Instruments, Inc.). Patch pipettes (3–8 megaohms) were pulled from thick-walled borosilicate glass (GC150F-10, Harvard Apparatus, Inc.) and filled with solution containing 125 mmpotassium gluconate, 1 mm MgCl2, and 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.3). The extracellular solution was composed of 140 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 2 mmCaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 10 mmd-glucose, and 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.3). ATP-induced responses were measured at −30 mV. Whole-cell currents were low pass-filtered at 2 kHz and digitized at 10 kHz. ATP was applied locally using a Picospritzer II (Parker Instrumentation). To ensure delivery of drug, 0.05% (w/v) fast green was used. (Local applications of 1% fast green induced no response.) To visualize cells expressing P2X receptors, cells were cotransfected with GFP (0.5 μg of pEGFP-N1 vector was included in the precipitate) and observed under a microscope with an epifluorescence attachment (Nikon Inc.). Untransfected cells and cells expressing GFP alone were found to have no inward current in response to application of ATP. Acquisition was performed using HEKA Pulse Version 8.30, and data were subsequently analyzed using IgorPRO Version 3.16. Statistical analyses were performed with Student's unpaired t test using InStat software (Version 2.01, GraphPAD Software). All cells were used 48 h post-transfection. For analysis of the subcellular distribution of GFP-tagged receptors, cells were fixed in 3% paraformaldehyde and 4% sucrose in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS; 1.5 mmNaH2PO4, 8 mmNa2HPO4, and 145 mm NaCl (pH 7.3)) for 10 min at 4 °C. Coverslips were washed with PBS and mounted onto slides with Vectashield (Vector Laboratories, Inc.) as a mounting medium. The basic protocol for live labeling of AU5-tagged receptors expressed in HEK293 cells or cultured neurons was as follows. Anti-AU5 antibody in serum- and supplement-free culture medium was applied for 30 min at 37 °C. Cells were then washed five times with PBS and fixed in paraformaldehyde. In all experiments, prior to application of antibodies, nonspecific sites were blocked using PBS containing 4% normal goat serum and 3% bovine serum albumin (blocking buffer). Antibodies were prepared at their final concentration in blocking buffer. To detect surface and internalized receptors, AU5-labeled receptors at the surface of fixed non-permeabilized cells were stained with a Cy3 (indocarbocyanine)-conjugated anti-mouse secondary antibody for 2 h at room temperature. Cells were then washed five times with PBS, permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS, and stained with a fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated anti-mouse secondary antibody for 2 h at room temperature to visualize prelabeled internalized receptors. To determine the ratio between surface receptors and the total receptor population, non-permeabilized cells were stained with a Cy3-conjugated anti-mouse secondary antibody. After permeabilization, cells were stained for total P2X4 population using anti-P2X4 antibody for 2 h at room temperature and then a FITC-conjugated anti-rabbit secondary antibody for 2 h at room temperature. To examine the effects of ATP on receptor internalization, neurons were labeled as described above, washed five times with buffer, and subsequently incubated for 15 min at 37 °C with or without ATP (100 μm) in extracellular solution (see “Electrophysiological Recordings”). Prelabeled receptors at the surface and internalized receptors were detected as described above. To measure transferrin uptake, HEK293 cells were incubated in serum-free culture medium for 30 min at 37 °C. Following three washes, coverslips were incubated for 15 min at 37 °C in serum-free medium containing transferrin/Alexa 546 (100 μg/ml; Molecular Probes, Inc.). Cells were then washed, fixed, and mounted. Fluorescence was visualized using a Zeiss Axiovert LSM510 confocal microscope with a ×63 oil immersion objective. For FITC/Cy3 double labeling, FITC and Cy3 were excited at 2 and 20% of 488 and 543 nm laser power, respectively. Images where the confocal plane was focused on the middle of the cell (0.7-μm thickness) were taken at 0.14 μm/pixel. For transferrin uptake, Alexa 546 was excited at 60% of 543 nm laser power, and 1-μm-thick images were taken at 0.07 μm/pixel. Identical acquisition parameters were used for image capture of individual experiments. Tagged image file format images were imported into NIH Image Version 1.62. Cells were outlined, and mean pixel values for each channel were obtained for a region over the cell soma. Pixel values were on an 8-bit scale (28 = 256, 0–255). For internalization experiments, green (FITC) fluorescence intensity indicative of internalized receptors was divided by AU5-labeled (red + green) fluorescence intensities. Similarly for surface expression experiments, red (Cy3) fluorescence intensity indicative of surface receptors was divided by total P2X4 (green) fluorescence intensity. For both types of experiments, measurements were normalized to control values. For analysis of puncta frequency, single confocal images (2-μm thickness) were taken of the processes of transfected neurons (≥10 μm from the cell soma). For counts of puncta frequency, a 1-pixel-thick line was drawn along neuronal processes and measured. Puncta of GFP-tagged receptors or of internalized AU5-labeled receptors were defined by being discrete areas of fluorescence with an intensity that was greater than twice that of the background. Data are presented as puncta/10 μm of neurite. Experiments were repeated at least three times; and each time, data were analyzed for cells from two separate coverslips. In each experiment, the data were normalized to control cells. The nvalue given refers to the number of cells analyzed. All data are presented as the means ± S.E. Histograms and plots were done using IgorPRO Version 3.16 software. Statistical analyses were performed by Student's unpaired t test or analysis of variance with Bonferroni's or Student-Newman-Keul's post hoc comparison using InStat software (Version 2.01). Levels of statistical significance are indicated in the figure legends. Clathrin-coated vesicles (CCVs) were prepared as described previously (22Campbell C. Squicciarini J. Shia M. Pilch P.F. Fine R.E. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 4420-4426Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Briefly, whole brains from adult Wistar rats were homogenized in an equal volume of buffer containing 0.1 mmMES, 1 mm EGTA, 0.5 mm MgCl2, 0.02% sodium azide (pH 6.5), and 0.5 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Debris and nuclei were removed by centrifugation at 5400 × g for 40 min. Coated vesicles were recovered from the supernatant by ultracentrifugation at 125,000 × g for 1 h. The pellet was resuspended in 4 volumes and then mixed with an equal volume of sucrose/Ficoll solution. Centrifugation at 28,000 × g for 40 min pelleted membranes and cytoskeletal elements (P3). The supernatant was diluted with 3 volumes of buffer and sedimented by ultracentrifugation at 125,000 × g for 1 h. Smooth vesicles were largely in the supernatant, whereas CCVs were recovered from the pellet. Fractions were separated by 10% SDS-PAGE (23Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207218) Google Scholar), transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, and probed with various primary antibodies and appropriate horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies, followed by detection with ECL (Amersham Biosciences, Buckinghamshire, UK). Membranes were stained with Ponceau S to check equivalent loading of samples. GST or GST-4C was expressed in Escherichia coli strain BL21 and purified according to standard procedures. Pull-down assays were performed using rat brain extract as described previously (8Kittler J.T. Delmas P. Jovanovic J.N. Brown D.A. Smart T.G. Moss S.J. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 7972-7977Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Precipitated material was eluted with Laemmli buffer, separated by SDS-PAGE, and analyzed by Western blotting. The following primary antibodies were used: affinity-purified mouse monoclonal anti-AU5 (5 μg/ml; BAbCO) and anti-α-adaptin (clone 100/2; 1:200) and rabbit polyclonal anti-P2X4 (6 or 1.2 μg/ml for immunoblotting; Alomone), anti-P2X2 (1.5 μg/ml; Alomone), anti-P2X7 (1.5 μg/ml; Alomone), and anti-GluR1 (0.1 μg/ml; Chemicon International, Inc.). FITC- or Cy3-conjugated goat anti-mouse or anti-rabbit IgG secondary antibodies (1:250; Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc.) were used for immunocytochemistry. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse or anti-rabbit secondary antibodies (1:10000; Amersham Biosciences) were used for Western blotting. Unless otherwise stated, all reagents were obtained from Sigma or Invitrogen. P2X4 receptors undergo constitutive and regulated endocytosis, whereas P2X2receptors do not (7Bobanovic L.K. Royle S.J. Murrell-Lagnado R.D. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 4814-4824Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). When heterologously expressed in neurons, P2X4 receptors are distributed in discrete intracellular puncta throughout neurites, whereas P2X2 receptors are more uniformly distributed at the plasma membrane. Many of the puncta of P2X4 receptors co-localize with a marker for early endosomes. To identify the molecular determinants of trafficking, we took advantage of this difference between the two receptor subtypes and generated chimeras between P2X2 and P2X4 in which the C termini were switched (Fig.1 A). GFP-tagged receptors were expressed in cultured neurons, and their subcellular distributions were visualized by confocal microscopy. Tagging the wild-type receptors with GFP at their C termini does not substantially alter their subcellular distribution or functional expression (7Bobanovic L.K. Royle S.J. Murrell-Lagnado R.D. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 4814-4824Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The trafficking of the chimeras was largely determined by their C-terminal region, with the distribution of the P2X2(4C) chimera resembling that of P2X4 receptors and, conversely, that of the P2X4(2C) chimera resembling P2X2 receptors (Fig. 1 B). The frequency of fluorescent puncta along the processes provides a comparative measure of receptor internalization. P2X4 had a frequency of 5.41 ± 0.46 puncta/10 μm (Fig. 1 C), similar to that of the P2X2(4C) chimeric receptor (4.86 ± 0.37 puncta/10 μm). In contrast, the frequency of puncta for P2X2 and the P2X4(2C) chimera was much lower (0.34 ± 0.19 and 0.77 ± 0.37 puncta/10 μm, respectively; p < 0.001). We examined which region of the P2X4 C terminus is important for trafficking by deleting 28, 14, and 7 amino acids from the end (CΔ28, CΔ14, and CΔ7, respectively). When GFP-tagged deletion mutants were expressed in neurons, the CΔ28 and CΔ14 mutants had a more uniform distribution than the full-length receptor, and the frequency of puncta was reduced. In contrast, the CΔ7 mutant exhibited a small decrease in puncta frequency that was not statistically significant (3.95 ± 1.26 puncta/10 μm;p > 0.05). Deletions at the N terminus (NΔ5 and NΔ14) had no effect on puncta frequency. Thus, the middle C-terminal region appears to possess determinants for P2X4 receptor trafficking. To identify the amino acids in this middle C-terminal region that are involved in trafficking, we individually substituted either alanine or phenylalanine for the four tyrosine residues at positions 367, 372, 374, and 378 and for the lysine residues at positions 370 and 371. Only at position 378 did the mutations substantially alter the distribution of the receptor (Fig.2). Y378A and Y378F reduced the frequency of puncta by between 3- and 4-fold. Similarly, the Y378A mutation in the P2X2(4C) chimeric receptor ablated the internalization conferred by the P2X4 C-terminal region. Alanine substitutions were made upstream and downstream of Tyr378 to identify other residues that might form part of a motif. Substituting alanine for Gly381 (Y+3) and Leu382 (Y+4) significantly reduced puncta frequency (2.54 ± 0.51 and 2.17 ± 0.31 puncta/10 μm, respectively;p < 0.001). In contrast, substituting alanine for Glu379 and Gln380 at Y+1 and Y+2 had no significant effect on receptor distribution, and neither did alanine substitutions at Val375 (Y−3) or at Glu376 and Asp377 (Y−2 and Y−1). Thus, the motif is of the form YXXGL. To directly measure the effects of the mutations on receptor internalization, GFP was removed from the C terminus, and an AU5 epitope was introduced into the extracellular loop to enable surface receptors in live neurons to be labeled. We previously showed that the introduction of this epitope produces a small shift in the concentration-effect curve for ATP, but does not otherwise alter the function or subcellular distribution of the receptor (7Bobanovic L.K. Royle S.J. Murrell-Lagnado R.D. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 4814-4824Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Receptors at the surface and those that had subsequently been internalized were detected with Cy3- and FITC-conjugated secondary antibodies, respectively (Fig.3 A). Cells were analyzed by determining the fraction of labeled receptors that were internalized at the soma (7Bobanovic L.K. Royle S.J. Murrell-Lagnado R.D. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 4814-4824Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 14Lin J.W., Ju, W. Foster K. Lee S.H. Ahmadian G. Wyszynski M. Wang Y.T. Sheng M. Nat. Neurosci. 2000; 3: 1282-1290Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar) and by counting the number of receptor puncta that were internalized during the labeling period in neurites (24Snyder E.M. Philpot B.D. Huber K.M. Dong X. Fallon J.R. Bear M.F. Nat. Neurosci. 2001; 4: 1079-1085Crossref PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar). Mutation of Tyr378, Gly381, or Leu382 significantly reduced the proportion of surface receptors that were internalized. In contrast, the V375A mutation had no effect (Fig. 3 B). To ensure that any decrease in internalization was not simply caused by an increase in surface expression and saturation of the endocytic machinery, internalized receptor fluorescence was measured in neurons with a range of surface expression levels. For cells with similar surface staining, there was considerably less internalized receptor fluorescence in those cells expressing the Tyr378, Gly381, and Leu382 mutant receptors compared with the wild-type receptor (see Supplemental Fig. 1). The frequency of internalized puncta for the Tyr378 and Leu382 mutants was reduced by ∼5-fold compared with the wild-type receptor (Fig.3 C). The more conservative Y378F mutation was as disruptive as the Y378A mutation, whereas the G381A mutation caused only a 2-fold decrease in internalized puncta frequency. Together, these results suggest that Tyr378, Gly381, and Leu382 form a non-canonical tyrosine-based endocytic motif. One of the clearest effects of the Tyr378, Gly381, and Leu382mutations was to increase surface immunolabeling (Fig. 3 A). To test whether this was caused either by an increase in the overall expression of the receptor in the cell or by an increase in the proportion of receptors at the surface, we compared surface (anti-AU5 antibody) with total (anti-P2X4 antibody) receptor immunofluorescence. Mutation of Tyr378, Gly381, or Leu382 caused between a 5- and 8-fold increase in the proportion of the total receptors that were at the surface (Fig.3 D). In fact, when we compared the mean total receptor fluorescence for the mutant and wild-type receptors, we found no significant difference in the amount of total receptor (p = 0.097, analysis of variance). Thus, mutation of the YXXGL motif increases the surface expression of P2X4 receptors; this is similar to the effect of coexpressing a dominant-negative mutant of dynamin-1 (7Bobanovic L.K. Royle S.J. Murrell-Lagnado R.D. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 4814-4824Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Whole-cell patch-clamp recordings were made from HEK293 cells expressing wild-type and mutant P2X4 receptors to determine, first, whether or not the mutants were functional and, second, whether the increase in surface expression was matched by an increase in functional expression (Fig.4). For these experiments, the receptors were not tagged with either GFP or an AU5 epitope. All of the mutants that we tested were functional, and the time courses of the inward currents in response to 100 μm ATP were similar to those"

It contains a conserved kinase domain at its NH2 terminus, whereas there is a regulatory domain at its COOH terminus. In this study we demonstrate that endogenous Mst3 is specifically cleaved when Jurkat cells were treated with anti-Fas antibody or staurosporine and that this cleavage is inhibited by the caspase inhibitor, Ac-DEVD-CHO. Using apoptotic Jurkat cell extracts and recombinant caspases, we mapped the caspase cleavage site, AETD313, which is at the junction of the NH2-terminal kinase domain and the COOH-terminal regulatory domain. Caspase-mediated cleavage of Mst3 activates its intrinsic kinase activity, suggesting that the COOH-terminal domain of Mst3 negatively regulates the kinase domain. Furthermore, proteolytic removal of the Mst3 COOH-terminal domain by caspases promotes nuclear translocation. Ectopic expression of either wild-type or COOH-terminal truncated Mst3 in cells results in DNA fragmentation and morphological changes characteristic of apoptosis. By contrast, no such changes were exhibited for catalytically inactive Mst3, implicating the involvement of Mst3 kinase activity for mediation of these effects.

The dysregulation of apoptotic cell death may be involved in the pathogenesis of a variety of human diseases, including cancers, autoimmune diseases, neurodegenerative disorders, and viral infection (3Sarraf C.E.

Growing evidence suggests that although apoptotic stimuli vary from cell to cell, there seems to be a basic biochemical mechanism underlying this process, which involves the activation of a family ofCys-dependent, Asp-specific proteases known as the caspases (7Ellis R.E. Yuan J.Y. Horvitz H.R. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1991; 7: 663-698Crossref PubMed Scopus (1935) Google Scholar, 8Soengas M.S. Alarcon R.M. Yoshida H. Giaccia A.J. Hakem R. Mak T.W. Lowe S.W.

The activated caspases can cleave downstream substrates, including components of the cellular DNA-repair mechanisms, apoptosis inhibitors, and structural proteins. Furthermore, recent evidence suggests that these caspase substrates are the true apoptotic effectors, not the caspases themselves. Therefore, it is imperative to identify the downstream targets of the caspases, and then to elucidate the effect of this caspase-mediated cleavage to delineate the biochemical mechanisms of apoptosis. Protein kinases have emerged as direct substrates and effectors of caspases (reviews in Refs. 10Bokoch G.M. Cell Death Differ. 1998; 5: 637-645Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar and 11Cross T.G. Scheel-Toellner D. Henriquez N.V. Deacon E. Salmon M. Lord J.M. Exp.

In a general survey of cleavage products in cells treated with apoptotic agents such as Fas ligand, two anti-apoptotic protein kinases, Raf-1 and AKT, were inactivated as immediate caspase substrates (12Widmann C.

Proteolytic cleavage of ATM generates an inactive kinase, and impairs DNA-repair capability in response to DNA damage (13Smith G.C. di Fagagna F. Lakin N.D. Jackson S.P. Mol. Cell.

Cleavage of focal adhesion kinase by caspases interrupts the assembly of the focal adhesion complex, resulting in cell death (14Levkau B. Herren B. Koyama H. Ross R. Raines E.W. J. Exp.

In other instances, caspase cleavage engenders the production of a more active kinase by removal of the inhibitory domains. In response to apoptotic stimuli, the cleaved, activated kinases are then serving to propagate the apoptotic signals through phosphorylation of the relevant substrates.

Several of the aforementioned kinases, including Mst1, Mst2, SLK, and HPK1, belong to the Sterile 20 family of serine/threonine kinases. Together, these observations imply that protein phosphorylation and/or dephosphorylation may play an essential role in apoptotic signal transduction. Sterile 20 was originally discovered as a component of the pheromone-response pathway in budding yeast (Ref. 33Ramer S.W. Davis R.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 452-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar; reviewed in Ref.34Dan I. Watanabe N.M. Kusumi A. Trends Cell Biol. 2001; 11: 220-230Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (495) Google Scholar). The mammalian Sterile 20-related kinases represent a rapidly growing kinase family, with 28 members identified in humans at the time of writing. Some of these kinases activate mitogen-activated protein kinase cascades, and serve as cellular sensors that respond to numerous stimuli (reviewed in Refs. 34Dan I. Watanabe N.M. Kusumi A. Trends Cell Biol. 2001; 11: 220-230Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (495) Google Scholar and 35Kyriakis J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 5259-5262Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Furthermore, they are traditionally divided into the p21-activated kinase and germinal center kinase (GCK) families, which are distinguished by the relative location of their kinase domains. The p21-activated kinase domains were located at their COOH termini, whereas the GCK homologs are at their NH2 termini. Four Mst family kinases are already known and can be divided into two subgroups, GCK-II (Mst1 and Mst2) and GCK-III (Mst3 and Mst4), based on their sequence homology within and outside their kinase domains, and additional information obtained from the Drosophila and/or Caenorhabditis elegans orthologs (34Dan I. Watanabe N.M. Kusumi A. Trends Cell Biol. 2001; 11: 220-230Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (495) Google Scholar). While sharing considerable homology in the kinase domain, the Mst kinases have different biological activities. For instance, Fas-mediated cleavage of Mst1/Mst2 is required for full activation of these kinases during apoptosis (26Kakeya H. Onose R. Osada H. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 4888-4894PubMed Google Scholar, 27Lee K.K. Murakawa M. Nishida E. Tsubuki S. Kawashima S. Sakamaki K. Yonehara S. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 3029-3037Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Overexpression of either full-length wild-type Mst1 or its truncated form in BJAB cells induces morphological changes characteristic of apoptosis (25Graves J.D. Gotoh Y. Draves K.E. Ambrose D. Han D.K. Wright M. Chernoff J. Clark E.A. Krebs E.G. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2224-2234Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar), suggesting that Mst1 is involved in this process. On the other hand, it has been demonstrated that Mst4, a newly identified Sterile 20-related kinase that shares 88% sequence similarity to Mst3 and SOK1 (36Qian Z. Lin C. Espinosa R. LeBeau M. Rosner M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 22439-22445Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), mediates the growth and transformation of the tumor cell lines, HeLa and Phoenix, via the MEK/ERK pathway (37Lin J.L. Chen H.C. Fang H.I. Robinson D. Kung H.J. Shih H.M. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 6559-6569Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar); whereas Mst1- mediated apoptosis occurs via the c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase pathway (38Ura S. Masuyama N. Graves J.D. Gotoh Y. Genes Cells. 2001; 6: 519-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). These findings indicate that the Mst family members may recognize distinct downstream targets, and hence, act through distinct signaling pathways. Analysis of the data raises interesting questions with respect to identification of the structural features that make Mst4 act differently to Mst1, and whether Mst3 might have a role in apoptosis (like Mst1), or cell transformation (like Mst4). In this study, we report that similar to Mst1 and Mst2 but not Mst4, Mst3 can be cleaved by caspases during apoptosis. Mst4 is resistant to cleavage, which may be the reason for cell transformation. The cleavage of Mst3 generates two fragments, 35 and 15 kDa, respectively. Unlike the conserved caspase-cleavage sites in Mst1 and Mst2, the caspase-cleavage site in Mst3 is mapped to AETD313G. Finally, ectopic expression of the truncated Mst3 results in kinase activation, nuclear translocation, and the induction of apoptosis. Taken together, these observations implicate the involvement of Mst3 in the process of apoptosis. All restriction enzymes were purchased from New England BioLabs. Fetal bovine serum, Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium, penicillin, streptomycin, and LipofectAMINETM were purchased from Invitrogen. The [γ-32P]ATP was also from New England BioLabs. The Ac-DEVD-CHO was purchased fromCalbiochem. Monoclonal antibody against GFP (CLONTECH) was used to detect the presence of the enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP)-tagged proteins. The bacterially expressed carboxyl terminus of Mst3 (amino acids 310–432) was prepared from pET21-Mst3. Recombinant Mst3 protein was purified, and rabbit antiserum against the Mst3 carboxyl terminus was generated. All cell lines were purchased from ATCC and maintained in a humidified incubator at 37 °C in the presence of 5% CO2. HeLa, COS-1, and 293T cells were grown in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Human embryonic kidney 293 (HEK293) cells were maintained in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium containing 10% horse serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Transfection of cells was performed with LipofectAMINETM according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The cDNAs, encoding full-length (amino acids 1–431) and truncated (amino acids 1–313) forms of Mst3, were amplified by reverse transcriptase-PCR using HeLa cell messenger RNA as the template. These constructs are referred to as Mst3WT and Mst3WTΔ314, respectively. The Mst3 cDNA fragments were inserted in-frame into the HA-tagged (at the COOH terminus) expression vector, pcDNA 3.0 (Invitrogen), and the EGFP-tagged expression vector, pEGFP-C2 (CLONTECH). The catalytically inactive mutants, Mst3KR and Mst3KRΔ314 (with Lys53 to Arg53mutation on the full-length and truncated Mst3), as well as caspase-cleavage site mutants (Mst3D301N, Mst3D302N, Mst3D307N, Mst3D309N, Mst3D313N, Mst3D321N, Mst3D324N, and Mst3D333N) of Mst3 were generated by site-directed mutagenesis using Mst3WT and Mst3WTΔ314 as the templates (QuikChangeTM site-directed mutagenesis kit, Stratagene). To induce apoptosis, Jurkat cells were treated with 250 ng/ml anti-Fas monoclonal antibody (clone CH11, Upstate Biotechnology Inc.) (39Enari M. Talanian R.V. Wong W.W. Nagata S.

To prepare the cell-free extracts, cells were lysed in lysis buffer (20 mm PIPES, pH 7.2, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1% CHAPS, 10% sucrose, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm Na3VO4, and 10 μg/ml each of leupeptin, aprotinin, chymostatin, and pepstatin) (24Wu Y.M. Huang C.L. Kung H.J. Huang C.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 17672-17678Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). After incubation at 4 °C for 30 min, cellular debris was removed by centrifugation. The TnT quick coupled transcription/translation system (Promega) was used to synthesize [35S]methionine-labeled proteins. The35S-labeled Mst3 or Mst4 proteins were incubated with various apoptotic extracts (150-μg extracts per reaction) or recombinant caspases (BD PharMingen) at 37 °C for 1 h. For caspase-inhibitor treatment, apoptotic extracts were preincubated with Ac-DEVD-CHO (Calbiochem) at 37 °C for 15 min before35S-labeled Mst3 proteins were added. COS-1 cells were transiently transfected with plasmids encoding various HA-tagged Mst3 proteins. Forty-eight hours after transfection, cells were lysed with modified RIPA buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 6 mm deoxycholate, 1% Igepal CA-630 (Sigma), 1 mm Na3VO4, 2 mm EGTA, 0.5% aprotinin, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Equal amounts of total lysates were immunoprecipited with anti-HA tag monoclonal antibody (3F10; Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and Protein A-agarose beads (Upstate Biotechnology Inc.) following standard procedures. Immune complexes were resuspended in kinase reaction buffer (20 mm PIPES, pH 7.4, 2 mm MnCl2, 10 mm MgCl2, 20 μm ATP, 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP, and 20 μg of histone H1) at 30 °C for 10 min. The kinase reaction mixtures or cell lysates were resolved using 12% SDS-PAGE. Proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes and detected with autoradiography or anti-HA antibody. The complexed IgGs were detected by incubation with secondary antibodies conjugated to horseradish peroxidase, and developed using the ECL system (Amersham Biosciences). The expression of EGFP-Mst3 in living cells was monitored using an inverted fluorescence microscope (Leica). The HEK293, 293T, and HeLa cells were cultured on chamber slides (LAB-TEK, Nagle Nunc) to about 70% confluency and transfected with pEGFP-Mst3 or its mutants. Twelve hours after transfection, the chamber slides were fixed with 5% paraformaldehyde containing 2% sucrose in phosphate-buffered saline at 4 °C for 20 min, followed by staining with 200 ng/ml 4′,6′-diamidino-2-phenylindole at 4 °C for 30 min. The fluorescence was analyzed using 4′,6′-diamidino-2-phenylindole (excitation/emission for 4′,6′-diamidino-2-phenylindole, 372/456 nm) and fluorescein isothiocyanate fluorescence filter cubes (488/510 nm). Photoimages were acquired using a Kodak digital camera, and then processed using Free PLUS software (Media Cybernetics, Silver Spring, MD). The β-galactosidase co-transfection assay for determination of cell death was performed as described earlier (41Berra E. Municio M.M. Sanz L. Frutos S. Diaz-Meco M.T. Moscat J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 4346-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar,42Diaz-Meco M.T. Municio M.M. Frutos S. Sanchez P. Lozano J. Sanz L. Moscat J. Cell. 1996; 86: 777-786Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). Briefly, HEK293 cells in 35-mm culture dishes (about 70% confluency) were transiently transfected with a pCMV/LacZ plasmid (0.5 μg) together with 1 μg of pEGFP-Mst3, pEGFP-Mst3WTΔ314, pEGFP-Mst3KRΔ314, or pEGFP-C2 (vector) constructs. Thirty-six hours after transfection, cell lysates were prepared by incubating with 200 μl of lysis buffer at room temperature for 15 min, as has been described. To detect the β-galactosidase activity, 50 μl of cell lysates were mixed with 200 μl of PM2 buffer (0.1 m Na3PO4, 1 mm MgSO4, and 0.2 mmMnSO4) and 200 μl ofo-nitrophenyl-β-d-galactopyranoside (4 mg/ml) for 3 h, or until a yellow color developed, at 37 °C. The reaction was stopped by adding 0.5 ml of 1 m Tris base (pH 7.0) and the β-galactosidase activity was determined by reading the optical density at 420 nm. DNA fragmentation analysis of the HEK293 cells was performed as described previously (43Zhang L. Chen J. Fu H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 8511-8515Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). Total DNA of the HEK293 (3 × 106) cells, with or without transfection of the various pEGFP-Mst3 plasmids, was isolated using a Puregene DNA Isolation Kit (Gentra Systems), as described in the manufacturer’s instructions. The DNA pellet was redissolved in 50 μl of DNA-hydration solution. Equal amounts of each isolated DNA sample were separated on a 2% agarose gel and visualized under UV light. To examine whether Mst3 might serve as a caspase substrate during apoptosis, cell-free apoptotic extracts were first prepared from Jurkat T cells as a source of caspases. It has been demonstrated that Jurkat T cells are hypersensitive to a wide variety of apoptotic inducers, such as anti-Fas antibody (11Cross T.G. Scheel-Toellner D. Henriquez N.V. Deacon E. Salmon M.

Chem. 1996; 271: 11209-11213Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). Treatment of Jurkat T cells with either anti-Fas antibody (CH11) or staurosporine for 5 h resulted in ∼30–40% cell death (Fig. 1), with a concurrent elevation of the activities of caspase 3, 6, 8, and 9 (3–5-fold; data not shown). The in vitro translated [35S]methionine-labeled Mst3 was proteolytically degraded in both apoptotic extracts, but remained intact when untreated extracts were used (Fig. 1). In addition, Mst3 cleavage followed the same time course as that for the activation of the caspases (data not shown), suggesting that caspase activity in these apoptotic extracts was likely responsible for the Mst3 cleavage. To test whether the cleavage of endogenous Mst3 also occurs in apoptotic cells, Jurkat T cells were treated with either anti-Fas antibody or staurosporine to induce apoptosis. Cell lysates were prepared, and immunoblot analysis was performed using an antibody against the Mst3 COOH terminus. Compared with the untreated Jurkat cell lysates, the data revealed a decrease in the amount of full-length Mst3 and the appearance of Mst3/C in the anti-Fas antibody and staurosporine-treated cells (Fig. 2). We were unable to detect the Mst3 NH2 terminus cleavage product because of the poor specificity of antibody against the Mst3 NH2 terminus. Similar cleavage patterns were also observed when HeLa cells were treated with staurosporine or tumor necrosis factor-α plus cycloheximide (data not shown). Several lines of evidence suggest that caspases are capable of Mst3 cleavage. First, the cleavage of [35S]methionine-labeled Mst3 in anti-Fas antibody (Fig. 3A) or staurosporine-induced apoptotic extracts (data not shown) was inhibited by Ac-DEVD-CHO, an inhibitor for caspase 3-like caspases. Second, proteolytic cleavage of the endogenous Mst3 was also partially blocked in the presence of Ac-DEVD-CHO when Jurkat T cells were treated with anti-Fas antibody (Fig. 3B) or staurosporine (not shown). Finally, [35S]methionine-labeled Mst3 was cleaved by purified recombinant caspases 3, 7, and 8 (Fig. 3C), generating two fragments (Mst3/N and Mst3/C) that mirror those observed for the apoptotic extracts. These results suggest that proteolytic cleavage of Mst3 is a general feature of apoptotic cells. It has been shown that the phosphorylation of presenilin-2 (45Walter J. Schindzielorz A. Grunberg J. Haass C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 1391-1396Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar) and Mst1 (46Graves J.D. Draves K.E. Gotoh Y. Krebs E.G. Clark E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 14909-14915Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar) regulates their cleavage by caspases. To verify if the kinase activity of Mst3 or its autophosphorylation were required for caspase-mediated cleavage, the invariant lysine (Lys53) in the ATP-binding pocket of Mst3 was mutated to arginine. The resultant mutant, Mst3KR, has neither kinase activity nor autophosphorylation ability, as determined by an in vitrokinase activity assay (will be discussed later). This mutant was transcribed/translated in vitro and treated with either apoptotic extracts or recombinant caspases. The kinetics of Mst3KR degradation were identical to that of the Mst3WT (data not shown), indicating that the kinase activity and/or autophosphorylation of Mst3 were not required for caspase-mediated cleavage. Previous studies have demonstrated that caspase 3 cleaves Mst1 (25Graves J.D. Gotoh Y. Draves K.E. Ambrose D. Han D.K. Wright M. Chernoff J. Clark E.A. Krebs E.G.

We have noticed that Mst3 also contains a potential caspase 3-recognition motif, DSGD324/W, in a similar region (Fig. 4, Aand B; the slash indicates the potential cleavage site in the amino acid sequence), suggesting that Mst3 may serve as a substrate for caspase 3 (or a caspase 3-like activity) during apoptosis. All the DXXD motifs of the Mst family members are located within the regulatory domain (Fig. 4A). Based on the size of the Mst3-cleavage products, it seems probable that D324/W is the candidate cleavage site (Fig. 4, A and B). The Asp324 site was therefore mutated to asparagine, and its susceptibility to cleavage by recombinant caspases was tested. Both the [35S]methionine-labeled Mst3WT and Mst3D324N mutants were cleaved by recombinant caspases 3, 7, and 8, indicating that D324/W was not an acceptor site for these caspases (Fig. 4E). Furthermore, [35S]methionine-labeled Mst4 was not cleaved by any of the recombinant caspases, including caspase 3, 7, and 8 (Fig.4C). These results suggest that the DXXD motif was not always the preferred cleavage site for caspases (especially the caspase 3) on their substrates, and that the cleavage properties of Mst3 and Mst4 (the GCK-III subfamily) are intrinsically different from that of Mst1 and Mst2 (the GCK-II subfamily). It was noted that there are several aspartic acids, such as Asp301, Asp302, Asp307, Asp309, Asp313, Asp321, and Asp333 (Fig.4D), in the vicinity of DSGD324. To identify the cleavage site for Mst3, these aspartic acids were individually mutated to asparagines, and their potential for caspase cleavage was tested by recombinant caspases 3, 7, and 8. Of all the mutants investigated, the Asp313 mutation blocked cleavage by recombinant caspases 3 (Fig. 4E), 7 (data not shown), and 8 (data not shown). Similar to Mst3WT, the rest of the mutants were cleaved by these recombinant caspases (Fig. 4E and data not shown). Similar experiments were carried out using cell-free apoptotic extracts and confirmed our findings (data not shown). Therefore, it is demonstrated that the caspase-cleavage site of Mst3 is at AETD313/G. Interestingly, there is no homologous site in Mst4, which may explain why Mst4 is not cleaved by caspases (Fig.4C). Caspase-mediated cleavage of Mst3 generates two fragments (Fig. 3C). To test whether Mst3 caspase cleavage changes its kinase activity, COS-1 cells were transiently transfected with HA-tagged Mst3 constructs encoding Mst3WTΔ314, Mst3KRΔ314, Mst3WT, or Mst3KR. Each sample was immunoprecipitated with anti-HA antibody and the immunocomplexes were subjected to a kinase-activity assay using histone H1 as the substrate. The kinase activity of Mst3WTΔ314 was about 10-fold higher than that of Mst3WT and no detectable kinase activity was observed for the catalytically inactive mutants of Mst3 (Fig.5). The most plausible explanation for these results is that caspase cleavage removes an inhibitory COOH-terminal regulatory domain from Mst3, thereby generating an active kinase. This is consistent with earlier data showing that deletion of the regulatory domain leads to a constitutively active Mst1 (25G"

Here, we tested the functional contribution of residues in the Bag domain of Bag-1M that contact Hsp70. Two point mutations, E212A and E219A, partially reduced co-chaperone activity, whereas the point mutation R237A completely abolished activity in vitro. Based on the strict positional conservation of the Arg-237 residue, several Bag domain proteins were predicted from various eukaryotic genomes.

Snl1p bound specifically to the Ssa and Ssb forms of yeast cytosolic Hsp70, as revealed by two-hybrid screening and co-precipitations from yeast lysate. In vitro, Snl1p also recognized mammalian Hsp70 and regulated the Hsp70 ATPase activity identically to Bag-1M. Point mutations in Snl1p that disrupted the conserved residues Glu-112 and Arg-141, equivalent to Glu-212 and Arg-237 in Bag-1M, abolished the interaction with Hsp70 proteins. In live yeast, mutated Snl1p could not substitute for wild-type Snl1p in suppressing the lethal defect caused by truncation of the Nup116p nuclear pore component.

All family members contain a ∼44-kDa N-terminal ATPase domain and a ∼25-kDa C-terminal peptide binding domain. Biochemically, the best characterized Hsp70 proteins are mammalian cytosolic Hsc70 (the constitutively expressed form) and DnaK of the E. coli cytosol. For both of these chaperones, the ATPase cycle has been shown to control the binding and release of substrate peptides by the C-terminal domain (2Bukau B. Deuerling E. Pfund C. Craig E.A. Cell. 2000; 101: 119-122Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar). Hsp70 chaperones alternate between two nucleotide-bound states; the ATP-bound form has low affinity for substrate with high on- and off-rates of peptide binding, whereas the ADP-bound state has high affinity for substrate with slow on- and off-rates (4Palleros D.R.

Hydrolysis of ATP induces conformational rearrangements within the C-terminal peptide binding domain that encloses peptide between a lidlike helical subdomain and a β-sheet structure that forms a binding cleft (8Zhu X.

Exchange of ADP for a fresh ATP molecule then converts the peptide binding domain to an open state, allowing efficient release of the bound peptide (4Palleros D.R. Reid K.L. Shi L. Welch W.J.

The steady-state ATPase rate (0.02–0.2 min−1) of DnaK and mammalian Hsc70 in isolation is too slow for efficient chaperone function, although peptide binding alone may stimulate the ATPase rate 2–10-fold (7Theyssen H.

The ATPase rate of DnaK is strongly stimulated by the activity of two co-chaperone proteins, DnaJ and GrpE. DnaJ stimulates the rate of ATP hydrolysis by DnaK up to several hundredfold, so that exchange of ADP for ATP becomes the rate-limiting step in the ATPase cycle. GrpE reduces the affinity of DnaK for ADP ∼200-fold and thereby accelerates the nucleotide exchange rate up to 5000-fold. Together, DnaJ and GrpE produce a more than 50-fold increase in the steady-state ATPase rate of DnaK, greatly increasing the protein folding activity of the system (6McCarty J.S. Buchberger A.

In the eukaryotic cytosol, the Hsp40 family of co-chaperones are homologs of DnaJ and act similarly to stimulate ATP hydrolysis by Hsc70 (17Cyr D.M., Lu, X. Douglas M.G. J. Biol.

No homologs of GrpE have been found in the eukaryotic cytosol; consequently, nucleotide exchange factors for Hsp70 in this cellular compartment were thought to be unnecessary because of a sufficiently fast spontaneous exchange rate (12Ha J.-H. McKay D.B. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 14625-14635Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 18Minami Y. Ho¨hfeld J. Ohtsuka K. Hartl F.U. J. Biol.

However, a nucleotide exchange stimulatory function has been suggested for the mammalian cytosolic protein Bag-1 (20Ho¨hfeld J. Jentsch S. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6209-6216Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar). Bag-1 was first identified as an interaction partner of the apoptosis inhibitor protein Bcl-2 (21Takayama S. Sato T. Krajewski S. Kochel K. Irie S. Millan J.A. Reed J.C. Cell. 1995; 80: 279-284Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (802) Google Scholar), and was later shown to directly interact with the N-terminal ATPase domain of Hsc70 (22Takayama S. Bimston D.N. Matsuzawa S. Freeman B.C. Aime-Sempe C. Xie Z. Morimoto R.I. Reed J.C. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4887-4896Crossref PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar, 23Zeiner M. Gebauer M. Gehring U. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5483-5490Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Importantly, Bag-1 stimulates the Hsc70 ATPase rate only in the presence of Hsp40, suggesting that it acts at the step of nucleotide exchange and not ATP hydrolysis (20Ho¨hfeld J. Jentsch S. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6209-6216Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar). Although Bag-1 was originally characterized as an inhibitor of the protein refolding activity of Hsc70 in vitro and in vivo (23Zeiner M. Gebauer M. Gehring U. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5483-5490Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar, 24Bimston D. Song J. Winchester D. Takayama S. Reed J.C. Morimoto R.I.

Biol. 2000; 20: 1083-1088Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar), substoichiometric levels of Bag-1 relative to Hsc70 can in fact enhance Hsc70 chaperone activity (19Terada K. Mori M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24728-24734Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Bag-1 exists as several isoforms generated by alternative translation initiation, all of which share the C-terminal sequences that mediate binding to Hsc70 (26Takayama S. Xie Z. Reed J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 781-786Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar). All of the Bag-1 isoforms regulate the Hsc70 ATPase activity similarly, but the originally identified isoform Bag-1M is much less effective at stimulating Hsc70-mediated protein refolding than the shorter and longer isoforms Bag-1S and Bag-1L (27Lu¨ders J. Demand J. Ho¨hfeld J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 4613-4617Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar). A family of co-chaperone proteins has been identified having sequences homologous to the C-terminal domain of Bag-1, the so-called Bag domain, which mediates binding to Hsc70 (26Takayama S. Xie Z. Reed J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 781-786Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar). However, unlike the Hsp40 co-chaperone family, the Bag domain proteins appear to be more specialized and it is not yet clear if they are universally present in eukaryotes. We recently solved the crystal structure of the ATPase domain of Hsc70 in complex with the ∼13-kDa Bag domain of Bag-1 (28Sondermann H. Scheufler C. Schneider C. Ho¨hfeld J. Hartl F.U. Moarefi I. Science. 2001; 291: 1553-1557Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar). Together with recent biophysical measurements and nuclear magnetic resonance experiments (29Brehmer D. Rudiger S.

Biol. 2001; 8: 349-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar), the structure clearly established Bag-1 as a nucleotide exchange factor for Hsp70. Binding of the Bag domain induces a conformational change in Hsp70 identical to that induced in the bacterial Hsp70 chaperone DnaK by the co-chaperone GrpE. However, the Bag domain is structurally unrelated to GrpE; although the Bag domain binds Hsc70 as a monomeric three-helix bundle, GrpE is a homodimer of ∼20-kDa subunits joined by a long α-helical stretch, and a subdomain formed largely by β-strands contacts DnaK (28Sondermann H.

Science. 1997; 276: 431-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar). Thus, the residues of Bag-1 involved in Hsp70 binding are different in both identity and structural position from their counterparts in GrpE. Here, we identify key functional residues of Bag-1 by structure-based mutagenesis. Mutant proteins show significantly reduced affinity for Hsp70, impaired stimulation of the Hsp70 ATPase, and a decreased ability to dissociate Hsp70-substrate complexes. Structural alignments and positioning of conserved functional residues revealed the existence of putative Bag proteins in various eukaryotic genomes. Biochemical analysis of the putative Bag protein Snl1p from Saccharomyces cerevisiae confirmed these predictions and established Snl1p as a nucleotide exchange factor for Hsp70 proteins in yeast. The Hsp70-regulatory function of Snl1p was found to be essential for its activity in vivo. For expression of N-terminally His6-tagged proteins in E. coli, pPROEXHTa (Invitrogen) plasmids encoding rat full-length Hsc70, the Hsc70 ATPase domain (Hsc70-N; residues 5–381), human Bag-1M, and the Bag domain of Bag-1M (Bag-C; residues 151–263) were as described (28Sondermann H.

DNA sequences encoding two cytosolic fragments of Snl1p (Snl1-C1 and Snl1-C2, containing residues 40–159 and 49–159 of Snl1p, respectively) were inserted into pPROEXHTa for overexpression of the N-terminally His6-tagged proteins inE. coli.

Chem. 1996; 271: 19617-19624Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar, 32Young J.C. Hartl F.U. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5930-5940Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). All other proteins were produced in E. coli BL21(DE3)pLysS (Novagen). Protein expression was induced by addition of 1 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 4 h at 37 °C. Harvested cells were resuspended in 500 mm KCl, 25 mm KH2PO4, and 20 mmimidazole, pH 7.5, lysed by repeated freeze-thaw cycles and sonication, and then cell debris was removed by ultracentrifugation. Supernatants were loaded on nickel-NTA-agarose columns (Qiagen) and the columns washed with the cell resuspension buffer. Proteins were eluted with 500 mm imidazole, 250 mm KCl, and 12.5 mm KH2PO4, pH 7.5, dialyzed against 100 mm KOAc, 25 mm HEPES-KOH, and 5 mm MgOAc2, pH 7.5 (buffer G), and stored at −80 °C. Binding constants (KD) in solution and stoichiometries of complex formation between Bag-1 and Hsc70 proteins were measured by isothermal titration calorimetry using a MicroCal MCS calorimeter (MicroCal Inc., Northampton, VA). Measurements were performed at 25 °C by titration of 100 μm Hsc70-N with 1 mm various Bag-1M proteins in buffer G, using serial 10-μl injections and a 400-s interval between injections. KD values were determined by integrating heats of binding normalized to the amount of injected protein, and the data were fitted to a 1:1 binding model using the Origin software package. To determine ATP hydrolysis rates, reactions containing the various proteins at 3 μm each in 50 mm KCl, 20 mm HEPES-KOH, 5 mmMgAc2, 2 mm ATP, pH 7.5, and 1 μCi of [α-32P]ATP (400 Ci/mmol; Amersham Biosciences) were incubated at 30 °C. Samples from time points in the linear range of the assay were analyzed by thin layer chromatography on polyethyleneimine-cellulose (Merck) developed in 0.5 mformic acid and 0.5 m LiCl. The amounts of ADP produced were quantified by phosphorimager analysis on a Fuji Film FLA-2000 using the MacBas software package and ATPase rates calculated. The release of Hsc70 from chaperone-substrate complexes was assayed as described (32Young J.C. Hartl F.U. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5930-5940Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). Briefly, purified Myc-tagged LBD was denatured in 1% SDS and 50 mmTris-Cl, pH 7.5, exchanged into buffer containing 1% Nonidet P-40, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 100 mm KOAc, and 25 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.5, then recovered with anti-Myc monoclonal antibodies covalently coupled to Protein G-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences). Immune pellets were washed with 5% glycerol, 100 mm KOAc, and 25 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.5 (buffer B). Chaperone binding was initiated by adding 50% desalted reticulocyte lysate (Green Hectares) in buffer B containing 5 mm MgOAc2, 2 mm ATP, and35S-labeled Hsc70 produced by in vitrotranslation using the TnT T7 system (Promega). After 10 min at room temperature, immune pellets were recovered and washed twice with buffer B. Release of Hsc70 from the immune pellets was assayed by immediate resuspension in buffer B containing 5 mmMgOAc2 and additions as indicated followed by a 10-min incubation at room temperature. The beads and supernatant were separated and proteins released into the supernatants precipitated with trichloroacetic acid. The amount of released and bound radiolabeled Hsc70 was analyzed by SDS-PAGE and phosphorimager quantitation. The two-hybrid host strain PH69–4A harboring pSW584, encoding residues 36–160 of Snl1p fused to the Gal4p-DNA binding domain (Gal4bd) in pGBT8, was transformed with three pools of an S. cerevisiae genomic library containing sequences fused to the Gal4p activation domain (35James P. Halladay J. Craig E.A. Genetics. 1996; 144: 1425-1436Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Expression of the Gal4bd-Snl1 fusion protein in PH69–4A was verified with immunoblotting using antibodies against Snl1p. The Gal4bd-Snl1p alone, or co-transformed with a plasmid encoding the control protein Snf1p fused to the Gal4p activation domain, did not activate theGAL7-lacZ reporter gene. Approximately 9 × 106 transformants of library pool pGad-C1, 1.5 × 106 of pGad-C2, and 1.4 × 106 of pGad-C3 were screened for a coverage that included all possible candidates, within a 99% confidence interval. Colonies were sequentially screened for the three reporter genes HIS3, ADE2, andlacZ, and library plasmids were isolated from positive colonies. The specificity of the Snl1p interaction was verified by lack of interaction with the control protein lamin C fused to Gal4bd. 30 positive isolates were obtained, and 12 analyzed by DNA sequencing. In the SSB1isolates where the fusion points with Gal4p activation domain could be determined, three were fused at residue 164 of Ssb1p, one at residue 202, two at residue 210, and one at residue 227. To prepare yeast cytosol, S. cerevisiae strain YPH499 (36Sikorski R.S. Hieter P. Genetics. 1989; 122: 19-27Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was grown in YPD at 30 °C and harvested in mid-log phase. Cells were washed with water, resuspended in buffer G containing Complete protease inhibitor mix without EDTA (Roche), and lysed by agitation with glass beads. Lysates were centrifuged at 30,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, separated from the beads, and centrifuged at 100,000 ×g for 30 min at 4 °C to remove membranes. For Snl1p pull-downs, 24 μg of His6-tagged Snl1-C1 or Snl1-C1-E112A/R141A was bound to 12 μl of nickel-NTA-agarose in buffer B containing 2 mg/ml ovalbumin (Sigma) for 30 min at room temperature, then the beads were recovered and washed with buffer B. The beads were resuspended in 400 μl of 1 mg/ml yeast cytosol in buffer G containing 1 mg/ml ovalbumin, 20 mm imidazole, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, and protease inhibitors, either in the presence of 4 units/ml apyrase (Sigma), 5 mm ATP or ADP. Reactions were incubated for 30 min at 4 °C and then washed with buffer G containing 20 mm imidazole and 0.1% Nonidet P-40, or the same buffer with 5 mm ATP or ADP in parallel to the binding conditions. Bound proteins were eluted with 25 mm EDTA and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and either Coomassie Blue staining or immunoblotting. Antibodies recognizing the C-terminal 80 and 56 amino acids of Ssa1p and Ssb1p, respectively, were a generous gift of E. A. Craig (Madison, WI) (37Lopez-Buesa P. Pfund C. Craig E.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 15253-15258Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Blots were developed using goat anti-rabbit antibodies conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (Sigma), and the ECL detection system (Amersham Biosciences). Yeast strain SWY2000 (MATα nup116–5::HIS3 ade2–1 ura3–1 his3–11,15 trp1–1 leu2–3,112 can1–100 pSW171(GAL/GST-Nup116-C)) (34Ho A.K. Raczniak G.A. Ives E.B. Wente S.R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 355-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) was transformed with pSW807(yeast library plasmid encoding SNL1), pSW534(GAL/SNL1), or p426GAL/Snl1-E112A/R141A. Cells were grown in media for 3 days at 23 °C in medium with 2% glucose, washed with medium containing 2% galactose, adjusted to identical cell densities, serially diluted in 5-fold steps, and seeded on medium containing either 2% glucose or 2% galactose. Growth was observed after 3–4 days. Representations of the Bag-C structure and its properties were obtained with the programs LIGPLOT, BOBSCRIPT, and RASTER3D (38Wallace A.C. Laskowski R.A.

The buried surface within the Bag-C-Hsc70-N complex structure was calculated using CNS (41Bru¨nger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J.

The conserved residues on the molecular surface of the Bag domain were mapped with ConSurf (42Armon A. Graur D. Ben-Tal N. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 307: 447-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar) using a CLUSTAL W (43Thompson J.D. Higgins D.G. Gibson T.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4673-4680Crossref PubMed Scopus (55767) Google Scholar) alignment (Fig. 4) as input. Surface representations were generated using GRASP (44Nicholls A. Sharp K.A. Honig B. Proteins. 1991; 11: 281-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (5316) Google Scholar). Alignments were carried out with PSI-BLAST (45Altschul S.F. Madden T.L. Scha¨ffer A.A. Zhang J. Zhang Z. Miller W. Lipman D.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3389-3402Crossref PubMed Scopus (59933) Google Scholar). We recently solved the crystal structure of the Hsc70 ATPase domain (Hsc70-N) in complex with the C-terminal Bag domain of Bag-1M (Bag-C) at 1.9-Å resolution (28Sondermann H. Scheufler C. Schneider C. Ho¨hfeld J. Hartl F.U. Moarefi I. Science. 2001; 291: 1553-1557Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar). Based on this structure, a mechanism for the nucleotide exchange activity of Bag domain proteins on eukaryotic cytosolic Hsp70 proteins has been proposed. The interaction with Bag-1M induces a conformational change in Hsc70 identical to the change in DnaK, the major bacterial Hsp70, induced by its specific nucleotide exchange factor GrpE (31Harrison C.J. Hayer-Hartl M., Di Liberto M. Hartl H. Kuriyan J. Science. 1997; 276: 431-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar). However, the contacts between the Bag domain and Hsc70 are substantially different from those between GrpE and DnaK, in both the position and nature of the residues involved. We therefore undertook a mutational analysis of Bag-1M to test the importance of specific residues for the functional interaction with Hsc70, and to aid in the identification of novel Bag domain proteins. The structure of the Bag-C-Hsc70-N complex is shown in Fig.1A, and a schematic representation of the contact residues in Fig. 1B. Among other contact points, Glu-212 and Glu-219 of Bag-1M interact extensively with Arg-261 and Met-61 of Hsc70. In addition, Arg-237 of Bag-1M forms a close contact with Glu-283 and Tyr-294 of Hsc70. Interestingly, although Glu-212 and Arg-237 of Bag-1M are absolutely conserved in other known Bag domain proteins, a leucine or isoleucine is usually found in the place of Glu-219 (28Sondermann H. Scheufler C. Schneider C. Ho¨hfeld J. Hartl F.U. Moarefi I. Science. 2001; 291: 1553-1557Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar). Therefore, to test the functional importance of these residues, the point mutations E212A, E219A, and R237A were introduced into the sequence of Bag-C. The mutant Bag-C proteins were purified, and their binding affinity for Hsc70-N was measured using isothermal titration calorimetry. Full-length Bag-1M and the Bag-C domain had similar affinities for Hsc70-N (KD values of 2.8 and 3.6 μm, respectively) (Fig. 2A). As predicted from the structure, the mutations E212A and E219A in Bag-C resulted in a substantial reduction in binding affinities for Hsc70-N (KD values 31 and 33 μm, respectively), and the mutation R237A affected the binding more strongly, showing a more than 10-fold reduction in affinity (KD 50 μm). The stoichiometry factors in all cases ranged between 0.85 and 1.05, consistent with 1:1 binding between the Hsc70 and Bag domains, and suggesting that the mutant Bag domains interact with the Hsc70 ATPase domain via the remaining unmutated contact residues. Reductions in the affinity of the Bag domain for Hsc70 should result in a reduced regulation of the Hsc70 ATPase activity. Therefore, the mutant Bag-C proteins were tested for their activity as nucleotide exchange factors for Hsc70, measured by stimulation of the Hsc70 steady-state ATPase rate under conditions where ADP-ATP exchange is rate-limiting. These conditions are met when ATP hydrolysis by Hsc70 is stimulated to its maximum rate by Hsp40, in which case the further addition of Bag-C significantly increased the overall ATPase rate roughly 10-fold (Fig. 2B) similar to full-length Bag-1M (20Ho¨hfeld J. Jentsch S. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6209-6216Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar,28Sondermann H. Scheufler C. Schneider C. Ho¨hfeld J. Hartl F.U. Moarefi I. Science. 2001; 291: 1553-1557Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar). Under identical conditions, the E212A and Glu-219 Bag-C mutants stimulated the ATPase activity only poorly, whereas the R237A mutant showed no significant ATPase stimulation (Fig. 2B). Importantly, the ATPase stimulation observed with the E212A and E219A Bag-C mutants was absolutely dependent on Hsp40, consistent with a residual activity of these proteins as nucleotide exchange factors. Another test of Bag-1M function is its ability to dissociate Hsc70-substrate complexes in an ATP-dependent manner, by favoring the ATP-bound state of Hsc70 with low affinity for peptide (27Lu¨ders J. Demand J. Ho¨hfeld J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 4613-4617Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar).

Caspase-8 activities in lymphocytes peaked ∼8 h and caspase-3 activity peaked ∼16 h after exposure to the parasite secretions. Subset analysis showed that mainly CD4+ and CD8+ cells (but not B cells) were susceptible to the parasite-induced pro-apoptotic effect. In situ staining confirmed the presence of apoptotic T cells around challenge parasites in the skin of naive or immunized animals. Analysis of T cells to identify the potential molecular pathway of the parasite-induced apoptosis showed increases in the expression of Fas, FasL, and the Fas-associated death domain. Blocking of FasL with a fusion protein reversed the parasite-induced apoptosis, suggesting a role for the Fas/FasL-mediated pathway in the parasite-induced T cell apoptosis.

Despite enormous effort to control the disease, schistosomiasis continues to be one of the major health hazards in parts of Africa, the Middle East, and Southeast Asia (1World Health Organization Expert Committee on the Control of Schistosomiasis Bull. WHO. 1993; 71: 657-677PubMed Google Scholar). Development of an effective vaccine against this infection remains elusive. Part of the problem may be due to the ability of the parasite to evade host immune mechanisms (2Terry, R. J., and Smithers, S. R. (1975) Symp. Soc. Exp. Biol. 453–465Google Scholar, 3Kolata G.

Compelling evidences from recent studies suggest that schistosomes may actually exploit the host immune responses for their own replication and transmission by suppressing host immune responses (5McKerrow J.H. Parasitology. 1997; 115: S107-S112Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar).

Similar to these findings, one of our recent studies showed that lymphocytes isolated from the skin or skin-draining lymph nodes of naive mice or mice immunized previously with radiation-attenuated cercariae ofS. mansoni fail to respond to antigens in the excretory secretory (ES)1 products of skin-stage schistosomula (12Kumar P.

Morphologically, these cells appear smaller and show nuclear and cytoplasmic condensation, suggestive of cell death by apoptosis (13Chen L. Ramaswamy K. J. Vet.

Immun. 2001; 69: 271-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) recently reported that when spleen cells or lymphocytes isolated from egg granulomas ofS. mansoni-infected animals were cultured in the presence of soluble egg antigens (SEAs), a significant proportion of CD4+ T cells in this preparation underwent apoptosis. This pro-apoptotic effect appears to be mediated by B cells that express functional FasL on their surface upon exposure to SEAs (22Lundy S.K. Lerman S.P. Boros D.L. Infect. Immun. 2001; 69: 271-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 23Lundy S.K. Boros D.L. Infect. Immun. 2002; 70: 812-819Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). In this study, we show that skin-stage schistosomula also similarly secrete antigens that can up-regulate FasL expression on lymphocytes, thus promoting apoptosis of skin T cells. In addition, we have also attempted to analyze the antigens secreted by skin-stage schistosomula to identify the pro-apoptotic molecule. Male C57BL/6 mice (6–10 weeks old; Charles River Laboratories, Wilmington, MA) were used in these experiments. Biomphalaria glabrata snails infected with S. mansoni were obtained from Dr. Fred Lewis (Biomedical Research Institute, Rockville, MD). Cercariae were collected from infected snails as described previously (24Ramaswamy K., He, Y.-X. Salafsky B. Exp. Parasitol. 1997; 86: 118-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), and mice were infected via the abdominal skin with 250 cercariae. For immunization, mice were immunized with 250 γ-radiation-attenuated (20,000 roentgen) live cercariae via the abdominal skin. 2 weeks after immunization, some of the mice were subjected to challenge infection with 250 normal cercariae. Forin vitro studies, cercariae were transformed into schistosomula, and ES products were collected as described previously (25Ramaswamy K. Salafsky B. Potluri S., He, Y.-X., Li, J.W. Shibuya T. J. Inflamm. 1995; 46: 13-22PubMed Google Scholar). A single cell suspension of skin-draining (inguinal) lymph nodes was made, and cell viability was determined by trypan blue exclusion. Cell viability was always >99% in all our preparations. In some experiments, cells isolated from skin-draining lymph nodes were separated into different subsets (Thy1.2+, CD4+, CD8+, and B cells) using magnetic beads (Miltenyi Biotech Inc., Auburn, CA, or Dynal, Oslo, Norway) coated with monoclonal antibodies specific for the respective cell subsets. Skin T cells (Thy1.2+) were isolated as described previously (12Kumar P. Ramaswamy K. Parasitol. Int. 1999; 48: 109-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The purity of these cells was >95% as confirmed by flow cytometry. 1 × 106cells isolated from the inguinal lymph nodes of infected mice, naive mice or immunized mice were suspended in 200 μl of medium and incubated with 60 μg/ml ES products for 24 h at 37 °C and 5% CO2 in air. Following incubation, cells were washed and stained with fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled annexin V or propidium iodide (BioSource International, Camarillo, CA). About 500–1000 cells were counted from each sample under a fluorescent microscope, and the percentage of positive cells were calculated. In some experiments, the percentage of annexin V-positive cells was determined by flow cytometry. Approximately 1 × 106 lymphocytes (CD4, CD8, or B cells) isolated from the skin or skin-draining lymph nodes of naive or immunized/challenged mice were suspended in 200 μl of medium and incubated with 100–150 schistosomula or 60 μg/ml ES products of schistosomula for 24 h at 37 °C and 5% CO2 in air. Following incubation, cells were harvested and stained with 50 μl of 10 μm PhiPhiLux substrate solution (Alexis Corp., San Diego, CA) for 45 min at 37 °C according to the manufacturer’s instructions. About 500–1000 cells were counted from each sample, and the percentage of caspase-positive cells was calculated. Because there was an increase in both caspase-3 and caspase-8 activities after exposure to 60 μg/ml ES products, we performed a time kinetics study (at 0, 8, 16, and 32 h after exposure) to measure differences in caspase-3 and caspase-8 activities in the skin-draining lymph node cells (5 × 106) collected from naive C57BL/6 mice. Specific activities of caspase-3 and caspase-8 were determined by a colorimetric assay using kits purchased from MBL (Nagoya, Japan). DNA fragmentation was evaluated as described by Kroemer et al. (26Kroemer G. Bosca L. Zamzamin N. Marchett P. Hortelano S. Lefkovits I. Immunology Methods Manual. 2. Academic Press Ltd., London1997: 1121-1122Google Scholar). Briefly, a subset of lymphocytes were incubated with ES products (60 μg/ml) or schistosomula (100–150/1 × 106 cells). 24 h later, the cells were treated with digestion buffer (SDS/EDTA/proteinase K) and subjected to DNA electrophoresis on a 1% agarose gel. Apoptotic cells around the parasites in the skin of mice were evaluated by TUNEL staining using an in situ apoptosis detection kit (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) following the instructions of the manufacturer. Skin samples collected 24 h after challenge were embedded in optimal cutting temperature compound (Sakura Finetek, Torrance, CA) and snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen. 8-μm-thick sections were cut using a cryostat and treated with proteinase K. Endogenous peroxidase activity was quenched using 1% hydrogen peroxide in methanol. Sections were then incubated with biotinylated dUTP in the presence of terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase, which incorporates the biotinylated nucleotides into the 3′-OH ends of fragmented DNA. Finally, the biotinylated nucleotides were detected using streptavidin-conjugated horseradish peroxidase, and color was developed using diaminobenzidine substrate. Methyl green was used as a counterstain. Adjacent sections were stained with a PE-labeled mouse anti-CD3 monoclonal antibody (BD Pharmingen, San Diego, CA), and isotype-matched nonspecific rat monoclonal antibody was used as a control. Some sections were also stained with hematoxylin and eosin. Total RNA was extracted from Thy1.2+ cells, skin-draining lymph nodes, or the skin of mice using Trizol (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s recommendations and reverse-transcribed using RETROscript (Ambion Inc., Austin, TX). The cDNA of β-actin in each sample was first PCR-amplified (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) using β-actin-specific primers (27Benavides G.R. Hubby B. Grosse W.M. McGraw R.A. Tarleton R.L. J. Immunol. Methods. 1995; 181: 145-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Band densities of β-actin in different samples were adjusted to approximately the same level. Individual samples were then PCR-amplified for Fas, FasL, and the Fas-associated death domain (FADD) using specific primers. Primer sequences for Fas and FasL were as published previously (28Chu C.Y. Tseng J. J. Biomed. Sci. 2000; 7: 58-63Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Primers for FADD were 5′-ATGGAGCTCAAGTTCTTGTGC-3′ and 5′-TCACTCTTGCTCACAGATTCC-3′ (GenBankTM accession number U50406). Primers for β-actin, Fas, FasL, and FADD amplified 550-, 281-, 590-, and 503-bp target fragments, respectively. PCRs were performed as follows: for β-actin, 3 min at 94 °C, 30 s at 57 °C, and 30 s at 72 °C for 30 cycles; for Fas, 3 min at 94 °C, 30 s at 62 °C, and 30 s at 72 °C for 32 cycles; for FasL, 3 min at 94 °C, 30 s at 60 °C, and 30 s at 72 °C for 30 cycles; and for FADD, 3 min at 94 °C, 30 s at 49 °C, and 30 s at 72 °C for 35 cycles. The final elongation was followed by 5 min at 72 °C. The products were resolved on a 1.5% agarose gel and stained with ethidium bromide. 1 × 106 skin-draining lymph node cells from naive or immunized mice were incubated with ES products (20, 60, or 80 μg/ml) for 24–48 h. Following incubation, cells were washed and incubated with rat anti-mouse CD16/CD32 antibody (BD Pharmingen) to block non-antigen-specific binding of immunoglobulins to the Fcγ type III/II receptors. Following this, cells were incubated with fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled rat anti-mouse CD3 antibody and PE-labeled anti-mouse Fas or anti-mouse FasL monoclonal antibody (BD Pharmingen) for 30 min at 4 °C and analyzed in a flow cytometer (Cytron, Orthodiagnostic Inc., Raritan, NJ). Isotype-matched nonspecific antibodies were used as negative controls. 1 × 106 Thy1.2+ cells isolated from skin-draining lymph nodes of naive mice were cultured with 60 μg/ml ES products or ES products plus 5 μg/ml recombinant Fas-Fc fusion protein (Alexis Corp.) for 24 h and then tested for annexin V binding. Recombinant S. mansoniG-binding factor was used as a control recombinant protein. Proteins in the ES products of normal schistosomula were size-separated initially into three different fractions by ultrafiltration using Centricon concentrators (Amicon, Inc., Beverly, MA). Fraction 1 contained molecules <3000 Da; fraction 2 contained molecules between 3 and 30 kDa; and fraction 3 contained molecules >30 kDa. Each fraction (60 μg/ml) was then tested for the presence of pro-apoptotic activity. These studies narrowed the pro-apoptotic activity to molecules between 3 and 30 kDa. Subsequently, Sephacryl S-100 high-resolution gel filtration medium (Amersham Biosciences) was used to separate the protein bands in fraction 2. The protein band that showed pro-apoptotic activity was then resolved on a 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, transferred onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Bio-Rad), and sent to the Protein Structure Facility at the University of Michigan for N-terminal amino acid sequencing. Statistical analysis was performed using a Mann-Whitney U rank sum test using Sigmastat Version 2.0 (Jandel Scientific, San Rafael, CA). Addition of ES products of normal schistosomula to lymphocytes collected from skin-draining (inguinal) lymph nodes of naive mice resulted in a significant decrease in cell viability as measured by propidium iodide staining. At 24 h after exposure to 60 μg/ml ES products, 34.3 ± 7.5% of cells were positive for propidium iodide. However, when cells were incubated with medium alone, only 13.2 ± 1.3% of cells were positive (p < 0.05) (Fig.1A). A similar decrease in cell viability was obtained when cells from naive animals were cultured with 100–150 schistosomula of S. mansoni (data not shown). Under light microscopy, a substantial proportion of cells exposed to the parasites or their ES products appeared smaller with condensed cytoplasm and nuclei (data not shown). Subsequent staining of the cells with annexin V and propidium iodide showed that 62.4 ± 8.9% of cells incubated with ES products (60 μg/ml) were positive for annexin V, whereas only 12.8 ± 2.4% of cells incubated with medium alone were positive for annexin V (p < 0.01) (Fig.1A). A similar decrease in cell viability was observed when Thy1.2+ cells isolated from the skin of immunized mice were incubated with 100–150 schistosomula or their ES products (data not shown). These observations suggest that the lymphocytes might undergo apoptosis upon exposure to the parasites or their secretions. In these studies, we monitored caspase-3 activity as a marker of apoptosis in various subsets of lymphocytes (CD4, CD8, and B cells) after incubation with 100–150 schistosomula or their ES products. Significant increases in caspase-3 activity were observed in both CD4+ and CD8+subsets of lymphocytes from either naive or immunized mice after exposure to the parasites or their secretions, whereas in B cells, the caspase-3 staining was not significantly different from medium controls (Fig. 1B). Similar results were obtained when Thy1.2+ cells isolated from the skin of immunized and challenged mice were exposed to the parasites or their secretionsin vitro (Fig. 1B). The pro-apoptotic effect of schistosomula or their ES products on CD4 and CD8 subsets of T cells was then further confirmed by analyzing their DNA for fragmentation. These studies showed typical fragmentation of DNA as evidenced by the characteristic ladder formation in both CD4 and CD8 subsets of lymphocytes from both naive and immunized mice that were exposed to schistosomula or their ES products (Fig. 1C). No DNA fragmentation was evident in cells incubated with medium alone (Fig. 1C) or in B cells that were incubated with the parasites or their secretions (data not shown). DNA fragmentation was also evident in Thy1.2+ cells isolated from the skin of immunized and challenged mice following exposure to the parasites or their secretions (Fig. 1C). Preliminary studies also showed an increase in caspase-8 activities in T cells exposed to ES products (data not shown). Therefore, we wanted to evaluate the time kinetics of the appearance of caspase-3 and caspase-8 activities in T cells exposed to the ES products. These studies showed that caspase-8 activities appeared first and peaked in the cells ∼8 h after incubation (Fig.2). Thereafter, there was a sharp decline; and by 16 h, caspase-8 activities in the cells were near base-line levels. On the other hand, caspase-3 activity showed a steady increase from 8 h after exposure to ES products and peaked at ∼16 h (Fig. 2). Previous studies showed that mononuclear cells accumulate around challenge parasites in the skin of immunized animals (24Ramaswamy K., He, Y.-X. Salafsky B. Exp. Parasitol. 1997; 86: 118-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Despite this marked cellular reaction around the parasite, very few normal parasites appear to die in the skin (24Ramaswamy K., He, Y.-X. Salafsky B. Exp. Parasitol. 1997; 86: 118-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). However, if the parasites are attenuated by γ-rays, several of them are retained in the skin; and among these, a few die due to the severe cellular reaction. Because our above results showed that secretions from normal schistosomula can cause apoptosis of T cells, we wanted to evaluate whether T cells that accumulate around normal parasites in the skin undergo apoptosis, thereby helping the parasite to escape. We used TUNEL staining to demonstrate apoptotic cells in the skin. These studies showed the presence of many apoptotic cells around migrating challenge parasites in the skin of immunized and challenged animals (Fig. 3E). Apoptotic cells were also seen around schistosomula in the skin of infected naive mice (Fig. 3C). No apoptotic cells were present in normal skin (Fig. 3A) or in the skin of immunized mice (Fig.3B). Simultaneous immunohistochemical analyses of adjacent sections with anti-CD3 antibodies showed that the majority of the cells around normal schistosomula (Fig. 3D) in the skin of immunized and challenged animals are T cells (Fig. 3F). There was no PE reactivity in sections incubated with isotype-matched antibody controls (data not shown). To determine the potential molecular pathway of the parasite-induced apoptosis in T cells, we analyzed the expression of Fas and FasL in skin-draining lymph node T cells from both naive and immunized mice after exposure to ES products. These studies showed a dose- and time-dependent increase in Fas+ CD3+ cells following exposure to ES products (Fig. 4A). Maximum expression was seen when cells were incubated with 60 μg/ml ES products for 48 h. Compared with medium controls, a higher proportion of cells from naive mice expressed Fas on their surface in response to ES products than cells from immunized animals (Fig.4A). Exposure to ES products also resulted in a significant increase in the number of FasL+ CD3+ cells isolated from both naive and immunized animals (Fig. 4B). However, the levels of FasL detection were low and were significant only at higher concentrations of ES products. RT-PCR analysis showed a relative increase in the message levels for Fas, FasL, and FADD in T cells isolated from the skin-draining lymph nodes of naive mice following incubation with ES products (Fig.5). Similar semiquantitative increases in the transcript levels of Fas, FasL, and FADD were observed in the skin tissue at the site of infection and in the skin-draining lymph nodes of naive animals or immunized mice following a challenge infection with normal cercariae (Fig. 5). These transcripts were low or absent in the skin and draining lymph nodes of uninfected naive mice (Fig. 5). Addition of recombinant Fas-Fc fusion protein to T cell cultures incubated with 60 μg/ml ES products resulted in 83.6% reduction in annexin V-positive cells (Fig. 6) compared with control wells that contained ES products, but no blocking recombinant proteins. The percentage of annexin V-positive T cells in Fas-Fc fusion protein-treated wells (27.4 ± 5.7%) was comparable to that in medium controls with no ES products (20.9 ± 3.5%). Addition of a control recombinant protein (S. mansoni G-binding factor) had no effect on the percentage of ES product-induced annexin V-positive cells (data not shown). To identify the pro-apoptotic molecule in the ES products of normal schistosomula, we separated the ES products into three fractions and incubated them with T cells isolated from the skin-draining lymph nodes of naive mice. These studies showed that significant pro-apoptotic activity, as measured by annexin V staining, was associated with fraction 2 (3–30 kDa) and fraction 3 (>30 kDa), although the majority of the activity was present in fraction 2 (Fig. 7). Fraction 1 (<3000 Da) did not contain any annexin Vbinding activity. Subsequently, bands in fraction 2 were isolated by gel filtration, and each was tested for its ability to induce apoptosis in T cells. These experiments narrowed the pro-apoptotic activity in the ES products of normal schistosomula to a protein of ∼23 kDa (Fig.7). As a preliminary step to identify the molecular structure of the pro-apoptotic molecule, we performed N-terminal amino acid sequencing on the 23-kDa protein. This analysis revealed the sequence as KDMITEDEMFTDSHCPRVVA. We believe that these data will potentially help in cloning the pro-apoptotic gene and may further allow extensive sequence analyses. The results presented in this study show that skin-stage schistosomula of S. mansoni can release molecules in their secretions that can induce apoptosis of T cells in the skin. Subsequent analysis suggested that this pro-apoptotic activity is associated with a molecule of ∼23 kDa. Preliminary studies to identify the molecular pathway by which T cells undergo apoptosis in response to the parasite or its secretion suggested a possible role for Fas/FasL mechanisms. Based on this finding, it is suggested that the parasite may use T cell apoptosis as a potential mechanism to subdue initial cellular responses in the skin (24Ramaswamy K., He, Y.-X. Salafsky B. Exp. Parasitol. 1997; 86: 118-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Following immunization with radiation-attenuated parasites, there is a significant increase in the numbers of IFN-γ-secreting CD4+ cells in the skin (12Kumar P. Ramaswamy K. Parasitol. Int. 1999; 48: 109-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) and skin-draining lymph nodes (12Kumar P. Ramaswamy K. Parasitol. Int. 1999; 48: 109-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 29Betts C.J. Wilson R.A. Immunology. 1998; 93: 49-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 30Mountford A.P. Coulson P.S. Pemberton R.M. Smythies L.E. Wilson R.A. Immunology. 1992; 75: 250-256PubMed Google Scholar). Functional analyses suggest that these IFN-γ-secreting T cells are potentially the effector cells that confer protection against challenge parasites in the lungs (30Mountford A.P. Coulson P.S. Pemberton R.M. Smythies L.E. Wilson R.A. Immunology. 1992; 75: 250-256PubMed Google Scholar, 31Pemberton R.M. Smythies L.E. Mountford A.P. Wilson R.A. Immunology. 1991; 73: 327-333PubMed Google Scholar). However, in one of our earlier studies, when we isolated T cells from the skin or skin-draining lymph nodes of immunized animals and incubated themin vitro with ES antigens from skin-stage schistosomula, they failed to proliferate or secrete IFN-γ (12Kumar P. Ramaswamy K. Parasitol. Int. 1999; 48: 109-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, significant amounts of IFN-γ were produced when these cells were stimulated in vitro with mitogen, antigens from radiation-attenuated parasites or with ES antigens from lung-stage schistosomula. This suggests that the normal skin-stage schistosomula might modulate the function of skin or skin-drain lymph node cells to escape host detection in the skin (12Kumar P. Ramaswamy K. Parasitol. Int. 1999; 48: 109-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). When observed under light microscopy, cells stimulated with ES antigens collected from normal skin-stage schistosomula appear smaller with condensation of cytoplasm and nuclei (13Chen L. Ramaswamy K. J. Vet. Parasitol. 2001; 15: 1-12Google Scholar), characteristics that are typical of cells undergoing apoptosis (32Schneider P. Tschopp J. Pharm. Acta Helv. 2000; 74: 281-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar, 33Hengartner M.O. Nature. 2000; 407: 770-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (6296) Google Scholar). The ability of schistosomes to induce apoptosis in host cells is well documented in the literature (14DosReis G.A. Barcinski M.A. Adv. Parasitol. 2001; 49: 133-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The most striking of the documentation is the studies presented by Carneiro-Santos et al. (7Carneiro-Santos P. Martins-Filho O. Alves-Oliveira L.F. Silveira A.M. Coura-Filho P. Viana I.R. Wilson R.A. Correa-Oliveira R. Parasite Immunol. (Oxf.). 2000; 22: 267-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), who suggested an important role for T cell apoptosis in immunoregulation during chronic S. mansoni infection in humans. When peripheral blood CD3+ cells isolated from chronically infected individuals with an asymptomatic intestinal form of the disease were incubated with SEAs of S. mansoni, nearly 30% of these cells became apoptotic (7Carneiro-Santos P. Martins-Filho O. Alves-Oliveira L.F. Silveira A.M. Coura-Filho P. Viana I.R. Wilson R.A. Correa-Oliveira R. Parasite Immunol. (Oxf.). 2000; 22: 267-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). In the present study, we have shown that similar to"

PCC 7942 exchanges the photosystem II reaction center D1 protein form 1 (D1:1) with D1 protein form 2 (D1:2). This exchange is only transient, and after acclimation to low temperature the cells revert back to D1:1, which is the preferred form in acclimated cells (Campbell, D., Zhou, G., Gustafsson, P., O¨quist, G., and Clarke, A. K. (1995) EMBO J. 14, 5457–5466). In the present work we use thermoluminescence to study charge recombination events between the acceptor and donor sides of photosystem II in relation to D1 replacement. The data indicate that in cold-stressed cells exhibiting D1:2, the redox potential of QB becomes lower approaching that of QA. This was confirmed by examining theSynechococcus sp. PCC 7942 inactivation mutants R2S2C3 and R2K1, which possess only D1:1 or D1:2, respectively. In contrast, the recombination of Q A− with the S2 and S3 states did not show any change in their redox characteristics upon the shift from D1:1 to D1:2. We suggest that the change in redox properties of QB results in altered charge equilibrium in favor of QA. This would significantly increase the probability of Q A−and P680+ recombination. The resulting non-radiative energy dissipation within the reaction center of PSII may serve as a highly effective protective mechanism against photodamage upon excessive excitation. The proposed reaction center quenching is an important protective mechanism because antenna and zeaxanthin cycle-dependent quenching are not present in cyanobacteria. We suggest that lowering the redox potential of QB by exchanging D1:1 for D1:2 imparts the increased resistance to high excitation pressure induced by exposure to either low temperature or high light.

It has been shown that during environmental stress and acclimationSynechococcus has the ability to shift between two different forms of the D1 polypeptide of the PSII1 reaction center complex (4Clarke A.K.

D1 form 1 (D1:1) is the preferred form in a cell acclimated to its normal growth environment, but when stressed under either high light or low temperatures D1:1 is exchanged for another form of the D1 protein called D1 form 2 (D1:2) (2Campbell D. Zhou G. Gustafsson P. O¨quist G. Clarke A.K. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5457-5466Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 6Clarke A.K. Campbell D. Gustafsson P. O¨quist G. Planta. 1995; 197: 553-562Crossref Scopus (49) Google Scholar). However, this exchange is only transient, and when cells have acclimated to the new growth conditions they revert to D1:1 (10O¨quist G. Campbell D. Clarke A.K. Gustafsson P. Photosynth. Res. 1995; 46: 151-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). These shifts are governed by changes in the relative expression of the psbAI gene encoding for D1:1 and the psbAII/III genes encoding for D1:2 (2Campbell D. Zhou G. Gustafsson P. O¨quist G. Clarke A.K. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5457-5466Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 4Clarke A.K. Soitamo A. Gustafsson P. O¨quist G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Haselhorn R. EMBO J. 1986; 5: 2789-2798Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). Of the 25 different amino acids, 13 reside in the N-terminal part, four in helix B, three in helix C, two in helix E, and the remaining three in the C-terminal region. Both D1:1 and D1:2 have a total of 360 amino acids. Gene-inactivation mutant strains expressing either only D1:1 (R2S2C3) or only D1:2 (R2K1) (11Golden S.S. Brusslan J. Haselhorn R. EMBO J. 1986; 5: 2789-2798Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar) have proven to be very useful in studies of differential psbA expression in response to environmental changes (10O¨quist G.

Res. 1996; 47: 131-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar).Cells with D1:2 appear to be more stress-resistant than those possessing D1:1 under conditions when the excitation pressure on PSII increases due to either increased irradiance or decreased temperature (2Campbell D.

This is partly due to a high rate of D1 synthesis and expression of the psbAII/III genes forming D1:2 under high excitation pressure (3Krupa Z. O¨quist G. Gustafsson P.

The back reactions of QA and QB with the different S states, which reflect the charge stabilization on both acceptors and donors of PSII, were assessed by using the technique of thermoluminescence (15Sane P.V. Rutherford A.W. Govindjee Amesz J. Fork D.C. Light Emission by Plants and Bacteria. Academic Press, Orlando, FL1986: 329-360Google Scholar, 16Inoue Y. Amesz J. Hoff A.

PCC 7942 through a temperature shift from 36 to 25 °C (2Campbell D. Zhou G. Gustafsson P. O¨quist G. Clarke A.K. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5457-5466Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). In addition, the use of two mutants, one of which expresses only D1:2 while the other expresses only D1:1 (11Golden S.S. Brusslan J. Haselhorn R. EMBO J. 1986; 5: 2789-2798Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar), allowed us to confirm whether the changed photochemical behavior observed in wild type cells under conditions that permit expression of either D1:1 or D1:2 are indeed due to the type of D1 polypeptide present in the PSII complex.RESULTSRepresentative TL curves of control and DCMU-treated wild typeSynechococcus cells are presented in Fig.1. The samples were illuminated for 30 s with white light during cooling to liquid nitrogen temperature (19Sane P.V. Desai T.S. Rane S.S. Tatake V.G. Ind. J. Exp. Biol. 1983; 21: 401-404Google Scholar). Deconvolution of the TL glow signal of control cells grown at 36 °C resolved three peaks exhibiting characteristicTM at 0 °C, 24 °C, and 37 °C (Fig.1A, Table I). The major peak around 24 °C accounted for about 85% of the total luminescence, while the peak around 37 °C accounted for most of the remaining luminescence with the peak appearing near 0 °C contributing to less than 0.5% (Table I).Table IPeak emission temperatures (T °C) and contribution of different glow peaks to the total area under the TL curve of wild type Synechococcus sp.

Mean values ± S.E. were calculated from six to eight measurements in three to five independent experiments. The measurements were performed in the presence and absence of DCMU following the temperature shift from 36 °C to 25 °C (180 min) and back to 36 °C. Open table in a new tab To identify the recombining redox species responsible for each of the peaks as documented in the literature (16Inoue Y. Amesz J. Hoff A. Biophysical Techniques in Photosynthesis. Kluwer Academic Publishers, Dordrecht, The Netherlands1996: 93-107Google Scholar, 22Gleiter H.M. Ohad N. Koike H. Hirschberg J. Renger G. Inoue Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1140: 135-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), the glow curve patterns were determined in the presence of DCMU. In agreement with previous reports (16Inoue Y. Amesz J. Hoff A. Biophysical Techniques in Photosynthesis. Kluwer Academic Publishers, Dordrecht, The Netherlands1996: 93-107Google Scholar, 21Vass I. Govindjee Photosynth. Res. 1996; 48: 117-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar), DCMU caused a complete loss of the 37 °C peak and appearance of a new peak at 28 °C (Fig. 1B; Table I). In an earlier study of Synechococcus sp. PCC 7942, the peak appearing around 40 °C was assigned to the recombination of S2 and Q B− (22Gleiter H.M. Ohad N. Koike H. Hirschberg J. Renger G. Inoue Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1140: 135-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), while the appearance of a DCMU or an atrazine-resistant peak around 30 °C was ascribed to the recombination of S2 and Q A− (16Inoue Y. Amesz J. Hoff A. Biophysical Techniques in Photosynthesis. Kluwer Academic Publishers, Dordrecht, The Netherlands1996: 93-107Google Scholar, 21Vass I. Govindjee Photosynth. Res. 1996; 48: 117-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). More precise identification of the characteristic temperatures of S2Q A− and S2Q B− peaks was obtained from flash-induced TL measurements. It has been demonstrated earlier that the TL band produced after two saturating flashes is related to both S2Q B− and S3Q B− recombinations (36Meyers S.R. Dubbs J.M. Vass I. Hideg E. Nagy L. Barber J. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 1454-1465Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 37Ma¨enpa¨a¨ P. Miranda T. Tyystjarvi E. Govindjee Ducruet J.-M Kirilovsky D. Plant Physiol. 1995; 107: 187-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). In fact, exposure of the control wild type sample to two consecutive flashes of white saturating light also yielded a glow curve pattern that could be deconvoluted in two peaks, the major one appearing at 38 °C and the smaller one at 25 °C, respectively (Fig. 2A). As expected, addition of DCMU drastically reduced the peak at 38 °C with the appearance of a new peak with a TM of 32 °C (Fig. 2B). Hence, because DCMU treatment causes the inhibition of the electron flow between QA and QB and concomitant conversion of S2Q B− to S2Q A− (16Inoue Y. Amesz J. Hoff A. Biophysical Techniques in Photosynthesis. Kluwer Academic Publishers, Dordrecht, The Netherlands1996: 93-107Google Scholar), the data presented above clearly indicates that the peaks appearing around 38 °C and 28 °C in our study originate from S2Q B− and S2Q A− recombinations, respectively. The smaller peak appearing at 23.7 °C is due to S3Q B− recombination, and the peak at 17.5 °C from an S3Q A− recombination (TableI). We emphasize that flash excitation at 0 °C of a fully relaxed sample in the presence of DCMU could not generate S3 unless S2 is quite stable in the dark. Because, in these cells, S2Q B− appears at higher temperatures, we believe that S2 is also relatively more stable and can generate S3 in the presence of DCMU. The situation is different in experiments using continuous illumination during freezing (as was done in the present study). It is possible that, in the presence of DCMU, S2 to S3conversion can occur with concomitant reduction of an acceptor like C550 at very low temperatures. Although the characteristicTM assigned for S3Q A− and S2Q A− recombinations seem higher than those reported for higher plants (16Inoue Y. Amesz J. Hoff A. Biophysical Techniques in Photosynthesis. Kluwer Academic Publishers, Dordrecht, The Netherlands1996: 93-107Google Scholar), they are well within the range observed in cyanobacteria (23Sugiura M. Inoue Y. Plant Cell Physiol. 1999; 40: 1219-1231Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar, 34Minagawa J. Narusaka Y. Iniue Y. Satoh K.

Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 1454-1465Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). In addition, different growth temperatures and the use of different organisms could result in shifting the peak positions to higher or lower temperatures (22Gleiter H.M. Ohad N. Koike H. Hirschberg J. Renger G. Inoue Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1140: 135-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 23Sugiura M. Inoue Y. Plant Cell Physiol. 1999; 40: 1219-1231Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). It is interesting to note that the observed temperature difference between S2Q B−and S2Q A− inSynechococcus cells is rather small compared with that in higher plant chloroplasts and suggests that the redox potential difference between QA and QB is much lower than in higher plants.Figure 2Thermoluminescence glow curves and mathematical decomposition in Gaussian sub-bands of control (36 °C) (A) and DCMU-treated (10 μm) (B)Synechococcus sp.

The presented glow curves are averages from five to seven measurements in three independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Shifting Synechococcus cells grown at 36 °C to a temperature of 25 °C induced a gradual low temperature shift of the two major glow peaks, and after exposure to 25 °C for 180 min the peaks exhibited a TM of about 21 °C and 30 °C, respectively. The resultant peak temperatures were very close to those observed in 36 °C-acclimated cells treated with DCMU (Fig.1B, Table I). Most surprising, the addition of DCMU caused only minor effects on the TL glow peak positions in cells shifted to 25 °C (Table I). It appears that exposing Synechococcuscells to 25 °C shifted the recombination temperatures of S2Q B− and S3Q B− pairs closer to those of S2Q A− and S3Q A− pairs. The time course of the reversible changes of S2Q B−, S2Q A−, S3Q B−, and S3Q A− recombinations during the temperature shift is presented in Fig.3. The characteristicTM of S2Q B− decreased gradually to 30 °C after 180 min of incubation at low temperature (Table I, Fig. 3A). Interestingly, transferring the cells back to the normal growth temperature of 36 °C caused a very rapid shift of the S2Q B− peak to higher temperatures. A similar trend was observed for S3Q B− recombinations (Fig.3B). In contrast, the temperatures of S2Q A− and S3Q A− recombinations remained fairly constant during the temperature shifts (Table I, Fig.3, A and B). In addition, the relative TL yield measured as the integrated area under the glow curves also decreased by 30% after 180 min of exposure of the cells to low temperature (Fig.3C). This effect was reversible, and the TL yield fully recovered after shifting the cultures back to the normal growth temperature of 36 °C.Figure 3Time course of S2Q B− and S2Q A− (A) and S3Q B− and S3Q A− (B) characteristic peaks in wild type Synechococcus sp.PCC 7942 cells during the temperature shift from the growth temperature of 36 °C to 25 °C for the first 180 min and back to 36 °C for the second part of the curve are shown.

Plant. 1998; 104: 405-412Crossref Scopus (9) Google Scholar), immunoblot analysis of the relative polypeptide abundance of the PSII reaction center D1:1 and D1:2 forms clearly indicated that the transfer ofSynechococcus sp. PCC 7942 cells from 36 °C to 25 °C caused a gradual appearance of D1:2 polypeptide and a concomitant decrease in the D1:1 polypeptide within 180 min (Fig.4). Interestingly, shifting the culture back to the normal growth temperature of 36 °C induced the opposite effect. The amount of D1:1 increased in parallel with the reduction in D1:2 abundance within the same time frame (Fig. 4). The finding that the changes in glow peak positions during the temperature shift from 36 °C to 25 °C occurred in parallel with the transient appearance D1:2 suggests that the recombination patterns between the S states and Q B− are controlled by the different D1 forms. Regression analysis of the experimental data yielded a strong linear correlation between the relative abundance of D1:2 polypeptide and the characteristic TM of S2Q B− TL-band (r2 = 0.851) (Fig.5). Furthermore, the observation that cells acclimated to 36 °C in the presence of DCMU and cells acclimated to 25 °C ± DCMU show approximately similar glow peak signatures suggests that the S2Q B− and S3Q B− recombinations in cells shifted to 25 °C have almost similar activation energies as the S2Q A− and S3Q A− recombinations in 36 °C grown cells.Figure 4Representative immunoblots (A) and densitometric analysis (B) of D1:1 and D1:2 polypeptides of PSII during the temperature shift ofSynechococcus sp.

PCC 7942 mutants possessing only D1:1 (mutant R2S2C3) or only D1:2 (mutant R2K1) (11Golden S.S. Brusslan J. Haselhorn R. EMBO J. 1986; 5: 2789-2798Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). As expected, the mutant expressing only D1:2 showed similar glow peak characteristics as wild type cells shifted to 25 °C. The characteristic TM of the major glow peak around 22 °C and the overall TL yield were not significantly affected by a low temperature shift to 25 °C (Fig. 6). It should be pointed out, however, that the TL yield of control R2K1 cells was 2-fold lower (TLAREA = 274.5 ± 41.0) than in wild type (TLAREA = 666.9 ± 67.2) and R2S2C3 mutant (TLAREA = 586.6 ± 37.6) cells. Furthermore, the mutant expressing only D1:1 showed at the growth temperature a major peak at 27 °C accounting for a little over 53% of the total luminescence and another appearing at 36 °C accounting for around 46% of the total luminescence (Fig. 6). This is qualitatively similar to what we found in the wild type cells grown at 36 °C (Fig. 1, Table I) This pattern is expected because at normal growth temperature the R2S2C3 mutant is similar to the wild type, which under the same conditions also contains only D1: 1.Figure 6Thermoluminescence glow curves of R2K1 mutant cells grown at 36 °C in the absence and in the presence of DCMU and the R2K1 mutant cells subjected to 25 °C for 180 min.

Campbell D. Gustafsson P. O¨quist G. Planta. 1995; 197: 553-562Crossref Scopus (49) Google Scholar) or by lowering the temperature under constant irradiance (2Campbell D. Zhou G. Gustafsson P. O¨quist G. Clarke A.K. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5457-5466Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar), there is a rapid and transient exchange of the D1:1 with the D1:2 polypeptide in the reaction centers of PSII. In full agreement with these reports, a very rapid differential response of D1:1 and D1:2 forms to low temperature shift was also observed in our study (Fig. 4). Furthermore, it should be pointed out that shifting the growth temperature back to 36 °C completely reversed the polypeptide abundance in only 3 h (Fig.4). It has also been shown earlier that cells with D1:2 are much more resistant to high light stress than cells possessing D1:1 because of both a sustained high rate of D1:2 turnover and associated PSII repair (4Clarke A.K. Soitamo A. Gustafsson P. O¨quist G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 9973-9977Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar) and an intrinsically higher resistance of cells with D1:2 (3Krupa Z. O¨quist G. Gustafsson P. Plant Physiol. 1990; 93: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 13Krupa Z. O¨quist G. Gustafsson P. Physiol. Plant. 1991; 82: 1-8Crossref Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The TL analyses of the present work indicate that the reversible shift between the D1:1 and D1:2 forms in Synechococcus has a major influence on the redox potential of QB (Figs. 1 and 3, and Table I). The finding that the S2Q B− peak in 25 °C shifted cells (containing D1:2) appears at temperature that is similar to S2Q A− peak suggests that the redox potential of QB in the presence of D1:2 is similar to the redox potential of QA. It has been demonstrated that the temperature at which the TL peak appears is proportional to the changes in free energy and therefore to the changes in the midpoint potential of the reactive species (25de Vault D. Govindjee Photosynth. Res. 1990; 24: 175-181PubMed Google Scholar). Because there is little, if any, change in the temperature at which the recombination reaction S2Q A− and S3Q A− occurs (Fig. 3), it is obvious that neither the redox potential of S2/S3, the oxidizing species participating in TL, nor the redox potential of QA are affected by a shift from the D1:1 to the D1:2 form. In contrast, it is evident that the redox potential of QB has changed significantly upon transition of the cells to 25 °C toward a more negative midpoint potential approaching that of QA. These differential effects of the low temperature stress on the redox properties of QA and QB are consistent with the fact that the QB site resides on the D1 polypeptide, whereas the QA site resides on the D2 polypeptide (26Xiong J. Subramaniam S. Govindjee Photosynth. Res. 1998; 56: 229-254Crossref Scopus (84) Google Scholar) of PSII reaction centers, which does not undergo a change under stress conditions (2Campbell D. Zhou G. Gustafsson P. O¨quist G. Clarke A.K. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5457-5466Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar).Changes in the TL band assigned to S2Q B− recombination to lower temperature have been well documented to occur in herbicide-resistant mutants of many species (27Demeter S.

The SAP155 kinases in cell lysates were blocked by the Ca2+ chelator EGTA and by the cyclin-dependent protein kinase inhibitor roscovitine. The phosphorylation level of SAP155 was dramatically increased during mitosis, and accordingly the activity of SAP155 kinases was augmented in mitotic lysates.

Their major components are the U1, U2, U5, and U4/U6 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein particles (snRNPs),1 which consist of small nuclear RNAs and a set of snRNP proteins. These snRNPs are recruited from nuclear storage/assembly sites known as the splicing factor compartments or speckles, and their assembly on pre-mRNAs occurs in a stepwise manner. According to a recent model of spliceosome assembly (2Hastings M.L. Krainer A.R. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 302-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar), U1 snRNP and U4/U6·U5 tri-snRNP first contact the 5′ splice site. Subsequently U2 snRNP binds stably to the intronic branch site region. The creation of splicing-competent spliceosomes also depends on the recruitment of numerous non-snRNP-associated splicing factors and requires multiple, ordered rearrangements between spliceosomal components. Substantial evidence implicates reversible protein phosphorylation in both spliceosome (dis)assembly and splicing catalysis (2Hastings M.L. Krainer A.R. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 302-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar, 4Murray M.V. Chew S.L. Post-transcriptional Processing and the Endocrine System. 25. Karger, Basel1999: 83-100Google Scholar). For example, the SR family of splicing factors contain a domain that is rich in Arg/Ser dipeptides, and the phosphorylation of these motifs by specific “SR” kinases has been shown to modulate the interaction of SR proteins with other splicing factors and with RNA during spliceosome assembly (5Xiao S.-H. Manley J.L. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6359-6367Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). The shuttling of SR proteins between the speckles and the spliceosomes and the dispersion of SR proteins from the speckles during mitosis is also controlled by phosphorylation (6Misteli T.

Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 297-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). The splicing factor SF1/BBP, which interacts with U2AF65 in an early step of spliceosome assembly, is a substrate for phosphorylation by protein kinase G (9Wang X. Bruderer S. Rafi Z. Xue J. Milburn P.J. Krämer A. Robinson P.J. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4549-4559Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The phosphorylation of SF1/BBP inhibits its interaction with U2AF65 and blocks splicing complex formation. A role for protein phosphatases in pre-mRNA splicing has also been firmly established. The protein Ser/Thr phosphatase PP2Cγ is required for an early step of spliceosome assembly (10Murray M.V. Kobayashi R. Krainer A.R. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 87-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), while okadaic acid-sensitive protein phosphatases, such as PP2A, appear to function during splicing catalysis (11Mermoud J.E. Cohen P. Lamond A.I. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 5263-5269Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). The adenovirus E4-ORF4 protein induces the dephosphorylation of host cell SR proteins by the recruitment of PP2A, which alleviates the inhibition of adenovirus IIIa pre-mRNA splicing by the SR proteins (12Estmer Nilsson C.

The only splicing factor that is known to be phosphorylated during splicing catalysis is SAP155, also named SF3b155 (14Wang C. Chua K. Seghezzi W. Lees E. Gozani O. Reed R. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1409-1414Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). This protein is one of the five subunits of the SF3b complex that, together with the SF3a protein complex, binds to a 12 S precursor of U2 snRNP and thereby converts it to the 17 S form that is recruited to the spliceosomes (15Das B.K.

It has been suggested that the phosphorylation of SAP155 during splicing catalysis somehow affects its association with RNA or with associated splicing factors (14Wang C. Chua K. Seghezzi W. Lees E. Gozani O. Reed R. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1409-1414Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Our interest in the control of pre-mRNA splicing by protein (de)phosphorylation stems from work on the nuclear protein NIPP1 (38.5 kDa). Originally we identified NIPP1 as an inhibitory subunit of a nuclear species of the Ser/Thr-specific protein phosphatase PP1, hence its name nuclear inhibitor of PP1(19Beullens M. Van Eynde A. Stalmans W. Bollen M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16538-16544Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Jagiello I. Beullens M. Stalmans W. Bollen M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17257-17263Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). The heterodimeric complex between NIPP1 and PP1 is inactive, but a protein phosphatase activity is revealed either by the binding of NIPP1 to RNA (21Beullens M. Vulsteke V. Van Eynde A. Jagiello I. Stalmans W. Bollen M. Biochem. J. 2000; 352: 651-658Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) or by the phosphorylation of NIPP1 on specific Ser/Thr or Tyr residues (21Beullens M. Vulsteke V. Van Eynde A. Jagiello I. Stalmans W. Bollen M. Biochem. J. 2000; 352: 651-658Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 22Vulsteke V. Beullens M. Waelkens E. Stalmans W. Bollen M. J. Biol.

Chem. 2002; 277: 19855-19860Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). In nuclear extracts NIPP1 is required for spliceosome assembly, and pre-mRNA splicing by these extracts is blocked when the recruitment of NIPP1 to the spliceosomes is prevented. Remarkably, the function of NIPP1 in spliceosome assembly is unrelated to its ability to bind PP1 or RNA, indicating that NIPP1 can act independently as a splicing factor and as a protein phosphatase regulator. The N-terminal third of NIPP1 largely consists of a Forkhead-associated (FHA) domain (26Boudrez A. Beullens M. Groenen P. Van Eynde A. Vulsteke V. Jagiello I. Murray M. Krainer A.R. Stalmans W. Bollen M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25411-25417Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), a phosphothreonine-binding module that is also present in many other, mostly nuclear proteins (27Li J. Lee G. Van Doren S.R. Walker J.C. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 4143-4149Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 28Yaffe M.B. Elia A.E.H. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 131-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). The FHA domain is required for the targeting of NIPP1 to the speckles (24Jagiello I. Van Eynde A. Vulsteke V. Beullens M. Boudrez A. Keppens S. Stalmans W. Bollen M. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 3761-3768Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and to the spliceosomes (25Beullens M. Bollen M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 19855-19860Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). We have previously shown that the FHA domain of NIPP1 interacts with CDC5L, a regulator of pre-mRNA splicing and mitotic entry (26Boudrez A. Beullens M. Groenen P. Van Eynde A. Vulsteke V. Jagiello I. Murray M. Krainer A.R. Stalmans W. Bollen M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25411-25417Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Although CDC5L is also present in the speckles, the targeting of NIPP1 to the speckles could at most be partially accounted for by its association with CDC5L since some speckles contained NIPP1 but no CDC5L. These data suggested that the FHA domain of NIPP1 has additional binding partners. Accordingly we show here that the FHA domain of NIPP1 also binds to the splicing factor SAP155 in vitro and in vivo. We furthermore demonstrate that the interaction between both components is controlled by multisite phosphorylation and is cell cycle-regulated. Synthetic fragments of Xenopus laevis SAP155 (109KIANREDEYKQQRRKMI125) and human NIPP1 (341PGKKPTPSLLI351) coupled to keyhole limpet hemocyanin were used for the generation of rabbit polyclonal antibodies. The antibodies were affinity-purified on the bovine serum albumin-coupled peptides linked to CNBr-activated Sepharose 4B. Monoclonal LexA tag and polyclonal His tag antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Rabbit and mouse secondary antibodies were obtained from Dako. Human cyclin E-Cdk2 was produced by baculovirus expression in High FiveTM cells (26Boudrez A. Beullens M. Groenen P. Van Eynde A. Vulsteke V. Jagiello I. Murray M. Krainer A.R. Stalmans W. Bollen M.

Stevens. The catalytic subunit of PP1 was prepared from rabbit skeletal muscle (26Boudrez A. Beullens M. Groenen P. Van Eynde A. Vulsteke V. Jagiello I. Murray M. Krainer A.R. Stalmans W. Bollen M.

Other key materials were obtained from MBI Fermentas GmbH (restriction enzymes and Pwo DNA polymerase), Sigma (Colcemid), Alexis Biochemicals (roscovitine), Calbiochem (microcystin-LR), Roche Diagnostics (endoproteinase Lys-C and Asp-N), and the Computer Cell Culture Center (HeLa cell nuclear extracts). Constructs for the bacterial expression of polyhistidine-tagged SAP155-(1–491) and SAP155-(223–322) were generated by subcloning of the corresponding PCR fragments of SAP155 in the pET16b plasmid. Vectors for the bacterial expression of GST- or polyhistidine-tagged NIPP1-(1–142) or NIPP1-(1–142) mutant (S68A/R69A/V70A/H71A) were described before (24Jagiello I. Van Eynde A. Vulsteke V.

Point mutations were introduced by the QuikChangeTM site-directed mutagenesis method of Stratagene. For the yeast two-hybrid screening, NIPP1-(1–142) and NIPP1-(225–351) were cloned in-frame with the LexA protein (which includes a DNA-binding protein) in the pEG202 plasmid (26Boudrez A. Beullens M. Groenen P. Van Eynde A. Vulsteke V. Jagiello I. Murray M. Krainer A.R. Stalmans W. Bollen M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25411-25417Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). The NIPP1-(1–142) construct was used as bait for the screening of a HeLa cell cDNA library subcloned in the pJG4-5 plasmid in-frame with the B42 activation domain. For the mapping of the interaction domain between SAP155 and NIPP1-(1–142) the SAP155 fragments 1–222, 323–491, 277–376, 201–301, 257–322, 257–301, and 381–491 were subcloned in-frame with the B42 activation domain in the pJG4-5 plasmid. The β-galactosidase activities were quantified by a liquid culture assay (CLONTECH yeast protocols handbook). Liver nuclear extracts, used for pull-downs with GST-NIPP1-(1–142), were prepared as described by Jagiello et al. (20Jagiello I. Beullens M. Stalmans W. Bollen M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17257-17263Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) except that the extracts were finally diluted in buffer without salt and Triton X-100. The extracts were prepared in the absence or presence of protein phosphatase inhibitors (0.5 μm microcystin-LR, 20 mm NaF, and 1 mm sodium vanadate). An aliquot of the extracts prepared without phosphatase inhibitors was preincubated for 10 min at 30 °C with PP1 (60 nm). For some pull-down assays recombinant SAP155-(223–322) (5 μg) was first phosphorylated by an overnight incubation at 30 °C in 30 μl of a buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl at pH 7.4, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 4 mm magnesium acetate, 1 mm ATP, and 0.12 μg cyclin E-Cdk2. Immunoprecipitations, GST pull-downs, and Western analyses were performed as described previously (20Jagiello I. Beullens M. Stalmans W. Bollen M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17257-17263Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 26Boudrez A. Beullens M. Groenen P. Van Eynde A. Vulsteke V. Jagiello I. Murray M. Krainer A.R.

A capped β-globin pre-mRNA fragment, comprising exon 1 through the BamHI site in exon 2, was synthetized in the presence of [α-32P]GTP. This primary transcript was used as a substrate for splicing in HeLa cell nuclear extracts (25Beullens M. Bollen M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 19855-19860Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitations during the splicing reactions were done as described previously (25Beullens M. Bollen M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 19855-19860Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Radioactively phosphorylated SAP155-(223–322) (25 μg) was precipitated with 20% (w/v) trichloroacetic acid. The pellet was washed once with 20% trichloroacetic acid and twice with diethyl ether and then dissolved in 100 μl of a buffer containing 20 mmTris at pH 8.5 and 0.01% (w/v) sodium dodecylsulfate. After an overnight incubation with 0.5 μg of endoproteinase Lys-C or endoproteinase Asp-N at 37 °C in a total volume of 200 μl, the digest was applied to a reversed-phase column (μRPC C2/C18 SC2.1/10 from Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated in 0.1% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid. The retained peptides were eluted with a linear gradient of acetonitrile (0–70%) in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. The radioactive fractions of the endoproteinase Asp-N digest were reapplied to the same reversed-phase column, this time equilibrated in water. The retained peptide was eluted with a linear gradient of ammonium acetate (0–10 mm) at pH 6.5. The radioactive peptides were sequenced as detailed before (21Beullens M. Vulsteke V. Van Eynde A. Jagiello I. Stalmans W. Bollen M. Biochem. J. 2000; 352: 651-658Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The phosphopeptides obtained from the endoproteinase Lys-C digest were241GSETpPGATPGS251 and241GSETPGATpPGS251, where Tp represents phosphothreonine. The endoproteinase Asp-N digest yielded the peptide 302DTPGHGSGWAETpPRT316. COS-1 or HeLa cells were grown on sterile 10-cm plates in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum (Invitrogen). The cells of one plate were lysed by sonication in 0.25 ml of a buffer containing 20 mm Tris at pH 7.4, 0.3 m NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, 0.5 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, 0.5 mmbenzamidine, 1 μm microcystin-LR, and 1 mmorthovanadate. Cells were blocked in mitosis by the addition of Colcemid (0.14 μg/ml) 20–24 h before lysis. Transcription was arrested by the addition of actinomycin D (1 μg/ml) for 1 or 3 h. The FHA domain of NIPP1 (residues 1–142) was used as bait in a yeast two-hybrid screening of a HeLa cell library. Of 41 positive clones, 15 clones encoded three different fragments of the splicing factor SAP155 (Fig. 1B). These SAP155 fragments interacted with the FHA domain with an affinity similar to CDC5L-(258–614) as determined by liquid β-galactosidase assays. However, the SAP155 fragments did not interact with the C-terminal domain of NIPP1 or with Sds22, an unrelated regulator of protein phosphatase-1 (Fig. 1B and not shown). The SAP155 fragments that interacted with NIPP1 all comprised (a part of) the TP dipeptide-rich domain in the N-terminal third of SAP155 (Fig. 1, A and B). The largest SAP155 fragment (residues 1–491) was also the best interactor of the FHA domain. However, deletion of the N-terminal 208 residues, which lie outside the TP-rich domain, only marginally reduced the interaction with NIPP1. Fragments of the TP-rich domain interacted less well with NIPP1-(1–142) than did the intact TP-rich domain, and generally the strength of the interaction decreased with the size of the SAP155 fragments. Interestingly, the non-overlapping fragments SAP155-(223–322) and SAP155-(323–491) both interacted with NIPP1-(1–142), indicating that the TP-rich domain of SAP155 contains multiple, independent interaction sites for NIPP1. To further explore the relevance of the interaction between NIPP1 and SAP155, we performed co-precipitation experiments. Following a preincubation of nuclear extracts from rat liver (Fig.2A) or HeLa cells (Fig.2B) with a bacterially expressed GST fusion of NIPP1-(1–142), a GST pull-down of the fusion protein caused a co-precipitation of SAP155. Likewise, the immunoprecipitation of NIPP1 from HeLa cell nuclear extracts was associated with a co-immunoprecipitation of SAP155 (Fig. 2B). Various observations indicated that the SAP155-NIPP1 interaction was critically dependent on the phosphorylation of SAP155. Thus, when the FHA domain was mutated (S68A/R69A/V70A/H71A) in residues that are part of a conserved phosphate-binding loop (29Durocher D. Taylor I.A. Sarbassova D. Haire L.F. Westcott S.L. Jackson S.P. Smerdon S.J. Yaffe M.B. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 1169-1182Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar), no co-precipitation of SAP155 was observed (Fig. 2, A and B). This mutated FHA domain also failed to interact with SAP155 in a yeast dual-hybrid assay (not shown). Pull-down experiments furthermore revealed that the co-precipitation of GST-NIPP1-(1–142) and SAP155 was increased when the liver nuclear extracts were prepared in the presence of a mixture of protein phosphatase inhibitors, while their co-precipitation was nearly completely abolished after a preincubation of the extracts with PP1 (Fig. 2A). On the other hand, an interaction between NIPP1 and SAP155 in HeLa cell nuclear extracts was only detected after a preincubation of the extracts with MgATP, suggesting that the endogenous SAP155 had been completely dephosphorylated during the preparation and/or storage of the extracts (Fig. 2B). In this respect, it is worthy of note that the nuclear extracts from HeLa cells were at least 10-fold more concentrated than those from rat liver, which favors a faster and more complete dephosphorylation by endogenous protein phosphatases. The TP-rich domain of SAP155 (Fig.1C) has been shown to be a substrate for phosphorylation by cyclin E-Cdk2 (18Seghezzi W. Chua K. Shanahan F. Gozani O. Reed R. Lees E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 4526-4536Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). We indeed found that SAP155-(223–322) and SAP155-(1–491) are excellent substrates for in vitrophosphorylation by cyclin E-Cdk2 as well as cyclin B-Cdk1 (Fig.3A and not shown). Moreover, a co-precipitation of GST-NIPP1-(1–142) and SAP155-(223–322) was dependent on the prior phosphorylation of the SAP155 fragment by cyclin E-Cdk2 or cyclin B-Cdk1 (Fig. 3B). Again a co-precipitation of both components was not seen when the FHA domain was mutated in its phosphate-binding loop. The above results indicated that the binding of SAP155 to NIPP1 might be dependent on the phosphorylation of TP motifs. We have subsequently studied in some detail the role of the TP dipeptide motifs in the interaction between NIPP1-(1–142) and SAP155-(223–322), which only contains 13 of the 29 TP motifs that are present in the TP-rich domain of SAP155. The involvement of each of the 13 TP motifs of SAP155-(223–322) in the interaction with NIPP1-(1–142) was studied by site-directed mutagenesis. Unexpectedly, not one of the 13 threonine to alanine point mutations completely abolished the interaction of SAP155-(223–322) with NIPP1-(1–142) as measured in a dual-hybrid assay (Fig. 4A), although some of the point mutants showed a significantly decreased interaction. These data suggested that the SAP155-(223–322)-NIPP1 interaction was controlled by multisite phosphorylation. To map the set of phosphorylation sites in SAP155-(223–322) that determine its interaction with NIPP1, we have identified phosphorylation sites of cyclin E-Cdk2 by the sequencing of proteolytically derived phosphopeptides (see “Experimental Procedures”). Three phosphorylation sites were identified as Thr244, Thr248, and Thr313. All three sites are followed by a proline, although none of the sites contains a basic residue at position +3 (Fig. 1C) as is commonly seen for Cdk phosphorylation sites. The mutation of all three sites into an alanine decreased the in vitro phosphorylation of SAP155-(223–322) by cyclin E-Cdk2 by only 79% (Fig.5A) but completely abolished the ability of SAP155-(223–322) to bind to GST-NIPP1-(1–142) in vitro (Fig. 5B). Also, the triple mutant did not interact with the FHA domain of NIPP1 in a dual-hybrid assay (Fig.4A), although this mutant was expressed well (Fig.4B). The mutation of two of the three mapped phosphorylation sites only partially abolished the interaction of SAP155-(223–322) with NIPP1-(1–142) (Fig. 4A). Importantly, the mutation of Thr244, Thr248, and Thr313 did not abolish the binding of a larger SAP155 fragment (SAP155-(1–491)) to NIPP1 as determined by pull-downs with GST-NIPP1-(1–142) or by two-hybrid assays (not shown). The latter data are in accordance with our findings that the fragment of the TP-rich domain that is C-terminal to residues 223–322 also harbors one or more binding sites for NIPP1 (Fig. 1B). The data in Fig. 4 suggested that SAP155-(223–322) acquires a binding site for NIPP1 after phosphorylation of Thr244, Thr248, or Thr313. To distinguish between common or distinct NIPP1 binding sites for these phosphothreonines, we have performed competition studies with synthetic SAP155-derived phosphopeptides. Fig. 5C shows that the synthetic peptide SAP155-(308–318), with Thr313phosphorylated, inhibited the binding of SAP155-(223–322) to GST-NIPP1-(1–142) in a concentration-dependent way. No competition was seen with the non-phosphorylated peptide. Combined with our observations that the FHA domain that was mutated in the established phosphate-binding loop failed to bind SAP155 (Figs. 2 and3), these data strongly indicate that the FHA domain only contains a single phosphothreonine binding site. Another phosphopeptide, SAP155-(239–253), with Thr244 and Thr248phosphorylated, was a less efficient competitor (not shown), suggesting that these phosphothreonines bind to NIPP1 with a lower affinity than does phospho-Thr313. The phosphopeptide SAP155-(308–318) (Thr(p)313) also disrupted the interaction between NIPP1 and full-length SAP155 in nuclear extracts in a concentration- and phosphorylation-dependent manner (Fig. 5C). These data suggested that all NIPP1 binding sites of SAP155, including those outside residues 223–322 (Fig. 1B), interact with the same fragment of NIPP1. Importantly, SAP155-(308–318) (Thr(p)313) also dissociated a complex of GST-NIPP1-(1–142) and phosphorylated CDC5L (not shown), indicating that SAP155 and CDC5L compete for the same binding site in the FHA domain of NIPP1. Since the phosphopeptide SAP155-(308–318) (Thr(p)313) disrupted the interaction between the FHA domain of NIPP1 and its ligands in nuclear extracts (Fig. 5C), we have explored whether this peptide also interfered with the recruitment of NIPP1 to the spliceosomes and with pre-mRNA splicing. Surprisingly, while the addition of the FHA domain of NIPP1 blocked the co-immunoprecipitation of endogenous NIPP1 and radioactively labeled β-globin pre-mRNA, the addition of the phosphopeptide did not have this effect (Fig. 6A). Likewise, the FHA domain blocked pre-mRNA splicing of the β-globin pre-mRNA fragment, but the SAP155-derived phosphopeptide did not interfere with splicing (Fig. 6B). Thus, the recruitment of NIPP1 to the spliceosomes is independent of the recruitment of SAP155 and CDC5L. Since SAP155 acquired binding sites for NIPP1 after phosphorylation by an interphase Cdk (cyclin E-Cdk2) as well as by a mitotic Cdk (cyclin B-Cdk1), we have examined whether the phosphorylation of SAP155 is regulated in a cell-cycle dependent manner. Pull-down assays with GST-NIPP1-(1–142) showed a huge increase in the amount of SAP155 that co-sedimented from lysates prepared from mitotically arrested COS-1 cells (Fig.7A) or HeLa cells (not shown) as compared with that from asynchronously dividing (interphase) cells. The increased binding of SAP155 in mitotic extracts was not due to an increased total concentration of SAP155 (Fig. 7B) and required an FHA domain with an intact phosphate-binding loop (Fig.7A), suggesting that it was mediated by an increased phosphorylation of SAP155. On the other hand, the amount of SAP155 that co-immunoprecipitated with NIPP1 was the same in interphase and mitotic lysates (Fig. 7C). Collectively these data suggested that SAP155 and NIPP1 are part of the same macromo"

Based on these results and because of its importance as a dye, the biocatalytic production of indigo by naphthalene dioxygenase was for some time a major goal of the biotech industry (3Murdock D. Ensley B.D. Serdar C. Thalen M. Bio/Technology. 1993; 11: 381-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 4Bialy H. Nat. Biotechnol. 1997; 15: 110Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Naphthalene dioxygenase was soon found not to be the only enzyme capable of indole oxidation: several other oxygenases that accept indole as a substrate have been identified (5Bhushan B. Samanta S.K.

These are either enzymes similar to naphthalene dioxygenase that activate oxygen with iron centers or members of the cytochrome P450 family (6Gillam E.M.J. Notley L.M. Cai H. de Voss J.J.

Although flavin nucleotides may be involved in electron transfer from cofactors in these proteins, none is known to be a flavoprotein oxygenase. This situation has changed with our recent finding that flavosystem oxygenases can be modified to accept unnatural substrates. 2-Hydroxybiphenyl 3-monooxygenase (HbpA; EC 1.14.13.44) fromPseudomonas azelaica HBP1 is a flavoprotein aromatic hydroxylase that catalyzes the hydroxylation of a variety of 2-substituted phenols to the corresponding catechols (12Eppink M.H.M.

The mechanism of HbpA has been extensively studied by spectroscopic techniques, which revealed that molecular oxygen is activated via the formation of a flavin (C4a)-hydroperoxide (15Suske W.A. van Berkel W.J.H. Kohler H.-P.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33355-33365Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), a common intermediate in the reaction cycle of this enzyme family (16van Berkel W.J.H.

University of Calgary Press, Calgary, Canada1997: 305-314Google Scholar). HbpA has a broad substrate spectrum, but does not hydroxylate indole (13Kohler H.-P.E. Kohler-Staub D. Focht D.D. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1988; 54: 2683-2688Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 17Held M. Suske W. Schmid A. Engesser K.-H. Kohler H.-P.E. Witholt B. Wubbolts M.G. J. Mol. Catal. B. 1998; 5: 87-93Crossref Scopus (64) Google Scholar). By directed enzyme evolution, we recently changed the substrate reactivity of HbpA toward 2-tert-butylphenol, a substrate that is not converted by the wild-type enzyme (18Meyer A. Schmid A. Held M. Westphal A.H. Ro¨thlisberger M. Kohler H.-P.E. van Berkel W.J.H. Witholt B. J. Biol.

Bioeng., in pressGoogle Scholar). As a side product of this work, we also obtained an HbpA variant (which we denoted HbpAind) with activity for the hydroxylation of indole. In this study, we report the characterization of HbpAindwith respect to its catalytic properties. Whereas previous work on indole-oxygenating enzymes was mainly aimed at the biotechnological production of indigo, we were especially interested in the formation of the by-product indirubin. Indirubin and its analogs have been identified as potent inhibitors of cyclin-dependent kinases (20Hoessel R. Leclerc S. Endicott J.A. Nobel M.E.M. Lawrie A. Tunnah P. Leost M. Damiens E. Marie D. Marko D. Niederberger E. Tang W. Eisenbrand G. Meijer L. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 60-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (734) Google Scholar). The crystal structure of cyclin-dependent kinase-2 in complex with indirubin derivatives showed that indirubin binds to the kinase ATP-binding site. As a consequence, it inhibits the proliferation of a wide range of cells and belongs to a group of novel anticancer compounds that act on the cell cycle (21Buolamwini J.K. Curr. Pharm. Des. 2000; 6: 379-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). Escherichia coli JM101 (22Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, New York1989Google Scholar) and the pUC18 plasmid (23Yanish-Perron C. Vieira J. Messing J. Gene (Amst.). 1985; 33: 103-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (11465) Google Scholar) were used throughout for cloning and expression of thehbpA gene. Alkaline phosphatase (EC 3.1.3.1) was purchased from Roche Molecular Biochemicals (Basel, Switzerland). Catalase (EC1.11.1.6) from beef liver and formate dehydrogenase (EC 1.2.1.2) fromCandida boidinii were obtained from Fluka AG (Buchs, Switzerland). 4- and 5-hydroxyindole were from ICN Biomedicals Inc. (Aurora, OH). Components for the complex medium were obtained from Difco. All other chemicals were of the purest available quality and obtained from Fluka AG. Directed evolution of HbpA was performed by error-prone PCR based on in vitro manganese mutagenesis as described earlier (18Meyer A. Schmid A. Held M. Westphal A.H. Ro¨thlisberger M. Kohler H.-P.E. van Berkel W.J.H. Witholt B. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 5575-5582Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The mutant library was subsequently plated onto LB medium. Cells harboring enzymes with activity for the hydroxylation of indole formed deep blue colonies. The single mutant D222V (HbpAD222V) was constructed using the QuickChangeTM site-directed mutagenesis kit from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA). Synthesis of wild-type HbpA and HbpAind was done in recombinant E. coli JM101 using M9 mineral medium and glycerol as the carbon source (17Held M. Suske W. Schmid A. Engesser K.-H. Kohler H.-P.E. Witholt B. Wubbolts M.G. J. Mol. Catal. B. 1998; 5: 87-93Crossref Scopus (64) Google Scholar). After harvesting the cells, the proteins were purified according to the method described recently (18Meyer A. Schmid A. Held M. Westphal A.H. Ro¨thlisberger M. Kohler H.-P.E. van Berkel W.J.H. Witholt B. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 5575-5582Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The activity of wild-type HbpA and HbpAind was determined by measuring substrate consumption and product formation with reverse-phase high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC)1 as described elsewhere (24Kohler H.-P.E. Schmid A. van der Maarel M. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 1621-1628Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The assay contained 0.2 μm HbpA or variant protein, 0.3 mm NADH, 0.2 mm2-hydroxybiphenyl, and 20 mm air-saturated phosphate buffer (pH 7.5). The activity of recombinant E. coli JM101 for the formation of indigo was determined in 250-ml shaking flasks containing 50 ml of LB medium (22Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, New York1989Google Scholar). Cultures of E. coli JM101 cells harboring a pUC18 derivative encoding HbpA or HbpAind were inoculated toA450 = 0.1. The cultures were incubated at 30 °C and vigorously shaken. When the culture color turned olive, samples of 1.1 ml were taken. 100 μl of these were used to determine the cell dry weight at 450 nm (25Witholt B. J. Bacteriol. 1972; 109: 350-364Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The remaining 1 ml was centrifuged, and the supernatant was carefully removed. Cell-associated indigo was extracted with N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) and quantified at 610 nm (ε610 = 15,900 liters mol−1 cm−1) (8O'Connor K.E. Hartmans S. Biotechnol. Lett. 1998; 20: 219-223Crossref Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The activity for indole was determined using an assay with NADH regeneration by formate dehydrogenase from C. boidinii (Fig.1) (26Kula M.-R. Wandrey C. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 136: 9-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). The assay contained 0.2 μm HbpA or variant, 0.25 units of formate dehydrogenase, 160 mm sodium formate, 10 units of catalase from beef liver, 0.3 mm NADH, and 2 mm indole in 1 ml of 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.5). The assay was stopped by the addition of 20 μl of 10% (v/v) perchloric acid, and the precipitated proteins were spun down. The pellet- and tube-associated indigo was extracted with DMF and spectrophotometrically quantified. Dissociation constants between the enzymes and substrates were determined by monitoring the absorption changes of the enzyme-bound FAD upon binding of substrate (27van Berkel W. Westphal A. Eschrich K. Eppink M. de Kok A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 210: 411-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). For this, 12 μm purified wild-type HbpA and HbpAind were titrated with known concentrations of 2-hydroxybiphenyl or indole, and the resulting spectra were recorded using a Varian Cary E1 UV-visible spectrophotometer. Plotting Δ absorbance at a specific wavelength allowed the calculation of the dissociation constants by weighted nonlinear regression analysis (Enzfitter, Elsevier-Biosoft, Cambridge, U. K.). Analysis of compounds formed during in vitro indigo assays was done by reverse-phase HPLC-MS (Hewlett Packard 1100 MSD). The compounds were separated on a Hypersil ODS column (5 μm, 4.5 × 125 mm) and detected with a diode array detector and a mass spectrometer. Acidified (0.1% formic acid) H2O (solvent A) and 50% methanol and 50% acetonitrile (solvent B) were applied as the mobile phase according to the following timetable: 0 to 8 min, 85:15 solvent A/solvent B, flow rate of 1 ml min−1; gradient to 10 min, to 65:35 solvent A/solvent B, flow rate of 2 ml min−1; to 15 min, 65:35 solvent A/solvent B, flow rate of 2 ml min−1. Standards for isatin, 4- and 5-hydroxyindole, 2-indolinone, and indole were commercially available. 3-Indoxyl was prepared by dephosphorylating 3-indoxyl phosphate with alkaline phosphatase under anaerobic conditions. HPLC-MS analysis of the formed pigments was done under isocratic conditions at a flow rate of 1 ml min−1 with 70% (v/v) methanol as the mobile phase for the pigments derived from indole and with 40% (v/v) methanol for those derived from 4- and 5-hydroxyindole. The formed pigments were analyzed by TLC using silica gel cards and either toluene/acetone (4:1) or chloroform/acetone (97:3) as the mobile phase (28Eaton R.W. Chapman P.J. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 6983-6988Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For ultrathin sectioning, cells were fixed in 2.5% glutaraldehyde for 60 min and subsequently washed with water and embedded in low-melting-point agarose. After fixation in 1% OsO4 for 60 min, the blocks were dehydrated with ethanol and acetone and embedded in Epon/Araldite (29Hess W.M. Stain Technol. 1966; 41: 27-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Sections cut from the Epon/Araldite preparation were contrasted with uranyl acetate and lead citrate. Freeze-fracturing was carried out following standard procedures using a Balzers BAF 300 apparatus. The specimen sandwiches were fractured at −150 °C and immediately replicated with platinum/carbon. All pictures were taken with a Philips EM301 electron microscope. We recently changed the substrate reactivity of 2-hydroxybiphenyl 3-monooxygenase (HbpA) from P. azelaica HBP1 by directed evolution (18Meyer A. Schmid A. Held M. Westphal A.H. Ro¨thlisberger M. Kohler H.-P.E. van Berkel W.J.H. Witholt B. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 5575-5582Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). This work led to a mutant monooxygenase with increased activity for the hydroxylation of indole. The HbpA variant was denoted HbpAind. E. coli JM101 cultures synthesizing HbpAind turned deep blue when grown overnight on LB medium. Electron microscopy revealed the extracellular accumulation of material, which, we believe, consists of the water-insoluble pigment. After centrifugation, the pigment was extracted from the pellet with DMF. It was authenticated as indigo by TLC with toluene/acetone (4:1) as the mobile phase and commercially available indigo as the standard. This analysis also revealed the presence of a major by-product. TheRF value of this red pigment corresponded to theRF value determined earlier for indirubin (28Eaton R.W. Chapman P.J. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 6983-6988Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Analysis by HPLC-MS with 70% (v/v) methanol as the mobile phase showed two prominent molecular ion (MH+) peaks at m/z263 with retention times of 3.7 and 4.2 min. The UV-visible spectra and the fragmentation patterns were compared with literature data (28Eaton R.W. Chapman P.J. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 6983-6988Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 30Fearon W.R. Boggust W.A. Biochem. J. 1950; 46: 62-67Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,31Laatsch, H., and Ludwig-Ko¨hn, H. (1986) Liebigs Ann. Chem. 1847–1853Google Scholar), which confirmed that these two compounds were indigo (3.7 min) and indirubin (4.2 min). The formation of indigo by recombinant E. coli JM101 cells growing on LB medium was quantified. Cultures expressing thehbpAind gene accumulated 150 μm indigo within 8 h, whereas cultures of the host synthesizing HbpA remained colorless (Fig. 2). Recombinant protein levels in both cultures were checked by SDS-PAGE, and HbpA levels were determined to be in the same range of ∼20% of total cell protein. When pigments were extracted with DMF from recombinant E. coli JM101 cultures, the extract had a deep blue color. The blue color disappeared upon storage at room temperature, and the solution turned red (Fig. 3). The red pigment was analyzed by UV-visible spectroscopy, HPLC-MS, and TLC. It was authenticated as indirubin by comparison of the obtained results with literature data (28Eaton R.W. Chapman P.J. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 6983-6988Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 30Fearon W.R. Boggust W.A. Biochem. J. 1950; 46: 62-67Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 31Laatsch, H., and Ludwig-Ko¨hn, H. (1986) Liebigs Ann. Chem. 1847–1853Google Scholar). Buffering the pH at a value of 7 or acidification with 0.1% (v/v) 10 m hydrochloric acid stabilized the formed indigo, whereas the addition of 0.1% (v/v) 10m sodium hydroxide or heating accelerated the disappearance of the blue color. The mutant monooxygenase HbpAind differs from wild-type HbpA by two amino acids: Asp222 was substituted by valine, and Val368 was substituted by alanine. HbpAind was purified according to the procedure developed for the wild-type enzyme with a yield of ∼30%. Analytical size-exclusion chromatography showed that the mutant monooxygenase formed a tetramer, which is also the case for wild-type HbpA (14Suske W.A. Held M. Schmid A. Fleischmann T. Wubbolts M.G. Kohler H.-P.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24257-24265Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). To identify the major reaction products of indole hydroxylation,in vitro indigo formation assays were performed. After 30 min, a sample was taken and immediately saturated with argon. The proteins were precipitated and separated by centrifugation. The pigments in the pellet were extracted with DMF and analyzed by TLC. They were identified as indigo and indirubin. Analysis of the aqueous phase by HPLC-MS revealed the presence of 3-hydroxyindole (indoxyl) and 2-indolinone (oxindole). When a sample was taken after 60 min of assay time, isatin was also detected (TableI).Table IMajor reaction products of indole hydroxylation by HbpAindThe major reaction products of in vitro indole assays were authenticated by reverse-phase HPLC-MS. The assays contained 0.2 μm HbpAind, 0.25 units of formate dehydrogenase, 160 mm sodium formate, 10 units of catalase, 0.3 mm NADH, and 2 mm indole in 1 ml of 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.5).1-a All compounds were compared with commercially obtained standards. Open table in a new tab The major reaction products of in vitro indole assays were authenticated by reverse-phase HPLC-MS.

To investigate the substrate range of the HbpAindmutant monooxygenase, in vitro assays were performed with 4- and 5-hydroxyindole and 5-bromoindole. For the variant enzyme, color formation could be observed with all substrates, whereas the control assays with the wild-type protein remained colorless. The pigment derived from 4-hydroxyindole was purple, that from 5-hydroxyindole was orange, and that from 5-bromoindole was pink. The polar reaction products of the assays with 4- and 5-hydroxyindole were analyzed by HPLC-MS. For this, the in vitro assay was stopped by the addition of perchloric acid, and the proteins were spun down. Mass peaks (MH+) at m/z 150 were detected in the supernatants from both reactions. This mass correlates with the single hydroxylated substrates. The corresponding compounds eluted between 4.5 and 6.5 min when using 40% (v/v) methanol as the mobile phase. The main condensation products had a prominent molecular ion peak (MH+) at m/z 279 and had retention times of 4.1 min for the assay with 4-hydroxyindole and 3.5 min for the assay with the 5-substituted isomer. UV-visible spectra showed the peak at 4.1 min to have a maximum at 494 nm, whereas the peak at 3.5 min had a maximum at 480 nm. Thus, the molecular mass and the spectral properties indicated that the dihydroxy derivatives of indoxyl red were formed (see Fig. 7). Thein vitro activity of the purified proteins for the natural substrate 2-hydroxybiphenyl was determined by measuring substrate consumption and product formation by reverse-phase HPLC. Thekcat of HbpAind was significantly lower than that of the wild-type enzyme (TableII). Indole hydroxylation activities were determined in assays with purified proteins and NADH regeneration by formate dehydrogenase from C. boidinii. The assay mixture containing the mutant monooxygenase showed a blue color within the first 30 min, whereas the assay mixture with the wild-type enzyme remained white. HbpAind formed up to 170 μmindigo, whereas hardly any indigo formation could be observed for HbpA (Fig. 4). The indole hydroxylation activity of HbpAind was ∼20 milliunits mg−1purified protein or ∼18 times higher than the corresponding value for the wild-type enzyme.Table IIKd and kcat values of wild-type HbpA and HbpAind for 2-hydroxybiphenyl and indoleEnzyme2-HydroxybiphenylIndolekcat 2-aDetermined by measuring substrate consumption and product formation by reverse-phase HPLC.

Open table in a new tab The affinities of the enzymes for 2-hydroxybiphenyl and indole were determined by titration of the purified proteins with known concentrations of substrate (Fig.5, insets). Plotting the absorption difference at a specific wavelength as a function of substrate concentration (Fig. 5) allowed the determination of theKd values. Whereas the dissociation constants for 2-hydroxybiphenyl were in the same range for both proteins, theKd value for indole was 20-fold lower for HbpAind than for HbpA (Table II). Wild-type HbpA shows an uncoupling of NADH oxidation from 2-hydroxybiphenyl hydroxylation of 21% (18Meyer A. Schmid A. Held M. Westphal A.H. Ro¨thlisberger M. Kohler H.-P.E. van Berkel W.J.H.

In contrast, there was significant uncoupling of NADH oxidation from hydroxylation for HbpAind compared with HbpA and HbpAT1 (TableIII). To investigate whether the increased uncoupling in HbpAind is an effect of the combination of the two amino acid substitutions or only due to the D222V exchange, the single mutant D222V (HbpAD222V) was constructed by site-directed mutagenesis. Uncoupling of NADH oxidation from 2-hydroxybiphenyl hydroxylation was 3-fold higher for the HbpAD222V mutant monooxygenase than for the wild-type protein (Table III).Table IIIUncoupling of NADH oxidation from 2-hydroxybiphenyl hydroxylationEnzymeAmino acid substitutionSpecific activityUnproductive NADH oxidationUncouplingNADH oxidation3-aDetermined by monitoring the NADH decrease at 340 nm.Product formation3-bDetermined by measuring substrate consumption and product formation by reverse-phase HPLC.s−1s−1s−1%HbpA3-cValues adapted from Meyer et al.

Indole is oxidized by different oxygenases that contain either protein-bound iron or cytochrome to activate molecular oxygen (6Gillam E.M.J. Notley L.M. Cai H. de Voss J.J. Guengerich F.P.

A 2-hydroxybiphenyl 3-monooxygenase variant (HbpAind), which we obtained during directed evolution of HbpA, showed the ability to hydroxylate indole. Thekcat/Kd of HbpAind for indole was 330-fold higher than that of wild-type HbpA and is in the same order as the catalytic efficiency determined for the engineered fatty-acid hydroxylase P450 BM-3 (33Li Q.-S. Schwaneberg U. Fischer M. Schmid R.D. Chem. Eur. J. 2000; 6: 1531-1536Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). This P450 variant was obtained by saturation mutagenesis and is the enzyme with the highest known catalytic efficiency for indole. Cultures of E. coli JM101 cells that synthesized HbpAind during growth on LB medium had an indigo productivity of ∼5 mg liter−1 h−1. In comparison, a recombinant E. coli HB101 culture that expressed the naphthalene dioxygenase genes produced ∼1 mg liter−1 h−1 during growth on the same medium to a similar cell density (2Ensley B.D.

Thus, the HbpAind flavoprotein recombinant is considerably (5–15-fold) more active in vivoin the formation of indigo from complex medium. Analysis of the pigments formed also showed the presence of the by-product indirubin, a structural isomer of indigo that is known to be formed by indole-oxidizing enzymes (4Bialy H. Nat. Biotechnol. 1997; 15: 110Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 10Hart S. Koch K.R. Woods D.R. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1992; 138: 211-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Indigo extracted from recombinant E. coli cultures showed only limited stability when stored in DMF at room temperature. This could be attributed to the pH of the solution. It is known from denim manufacturing that at basic pH indigo is chemically reduced to its water-soluble form, indigo white. In contrast, the formed indirubin was stable when extracted and stored in DMF. The products of indole oxidation by different mono- and dioxygenases have been investigated. Indole epoxide has been suggested as a product of the reaction catalyzed by styrene monooxygenase (7O'Connor K.E. Dobson A.D.W. Hartmans S. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1997; 63: 4287-4291Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and indoxyl (3-hydroxyindole) has been identified as a hydroxylation product of cytochrome P450 enzymes (6Gillam E.M.J. Notley L.M. Cai H. de Voss J.J. Guengerich F.P. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 13817-13824Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). Oxidation by naphthalene dioxygenase results in the formation of 2,3-dihydroxy-2,3-dihydroindole (2Ensley B.D. Ratzkin B.J. Osslund T.D. Simon M.J. Wackett L.P. Gibson D.T. Science. 1983; 222: 167-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar). All these reaction products are unstable and spontaneously form pigments. The identification of the intermediates formed during in vitro indigo assays with HbpAind suggests a similar route as observed for the P450 enzymes (Fig.6). The identification of 3-hydroxyindole and 2-indolinone indicates direct hydroxylation at the carbons of the pyrrole ring of indole. In contrast to the P450 enzymes, no hydroxylation at the benzene ring of the substrate was observed (6Gillam E.M.J. Notley L.M. Cai H. de Voss J.J. Guengerich F.P. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 13817-13824Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). The presence of isatin could have two origins: it was produced either by hydroxylation of indoxyl or oxindole or by the decomposition of indigo and indirubin. The formation of indigo and indirubin from the enzymatic hydroxylation products of indole is spontaneous and biocatalyst-independent. In short, condensation of two molecules of indoxyl followed by air oxidation leads to the production of indigo, whereas condensation of indoxyl and 2-indolinone yields indirubin (28Eaton R.W. Chapman P.J. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 6983-6988Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,34Russell G.A. Kaupp G. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1969; 91: 3851-3859Crossref Scopus (113) Google Scholar). In addition, indirubin can also be formed by the reaction of indoxyl with isatin (4Bialy H. Nat. Biotechnol. 1997; 15: 110Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 35Maugard T. Enaud E. Choisy P. Legoy M.D. Phytochemistry. 2001; 58: 897-904Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). That this latter reaction does indeed take place in the case of indirubin formation by HbpAind is supported by the fact that the ratio of indirubin to indigo increased with time when recombinant E. coli cells were grown on LB medium. Indirubin inhibits cyclin-dependent kinases and therefore belongs to a group of promising anticancer compounds (20Hoessel R. Leclerc S. Endicott J.A. Nobel M.E.M. Lawrie A. Tunnah P. Leost M. Damiens E. Marie D. Marko D. Niederberger E. Tang W. Eisenbrand G. Meijer L. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 60-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (734) Google Scholar). Analogs such as indirubin 3′-monoxime and halogenated indirubins show even higher potency (36Marko D. Schatzle S. Friedel A. Genzlinger A. Zankl H. Meijer L. Eisenbrand G. Br. J. Cancer. 2001; 84: 283-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). This increased biological activity can be attributed to the lower hydrophobicity of the derivatives compared to indirubin. Thus, the uptake of the compound is facilitated and the probability that it reaches the biological sites of action is increased (37Hansch C. Acc. Chem. Res. 1969; 2: 232-239Crossref Scopus (878) Google Scholar). In this context, we investigated the substrate spectrum of HbpAind. The variant showed activity with several indole derivatives such as 4- and 5-hydroxyindole. The products of these reactions are potentially interesting because their log P values are significantly different from that of the unsubstituted indirubin and are hardly accessible by chemical means. However, analysis of the formed pigments showed that the dihydroxyindirubin derivatives were only a minor product of the reaction of HbpAind with hydroxyindoles. The mass and the spectral properties of the major condensation product indicated that mainly the indoxyl red derivatives were formed. Indoxyl red is known to be formed from the reaction of 3-oxo-3H-indole with indole (38Capdevielle P. Maumy M. Tetrahedron Lett. 1993; 34: 2953-2956Crossref Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The proposed pathway for the formation of the dihydroxy derivatives by HbpAind from hydroxyindole is shown in Fig. 7. The electron-donating hydroxyl group at the benzene ring facilitates the oxidation of the indolinone compared with the unsubstituted compound and may explain why indoxyl red was not detected from the reaction of HbpAind with indole. Indoxyl red shares a high degree of structural similarities with indirubin. The dihydroxy derivatives have a strongly decreased hydrophobicity, and their potency in inhibiting cyclin-dependent kinases is worth investigating. We characterized HbpAind with respect to its catalytic properties. The variant’s activity for indole was increased by ∼18-fold compared with the wild-type enzyme. This increase was concomitant with an enhanced affinity of the enzyme for this substrate. The in vitro activity of the mutant monooxygenase for the natural substrate 2-hydroxybiphenyl was significantly decreased, whereas its affinity for this substrate remained unchanged. This is mostly due to a slower flavin reduction, as indicated by the reduced NADH oxidation rate. In addition, uncoupling of NADH oxidation from substrate hydroxylation was significantly increased in HbpAind. HbpAind evolved from the single mutant V368A (HbpAT1) by directed enzyme evolution. In contrast to wild-type HbpA, HbpAT1 fully couples NADH oxidation to 2-hydroxybiphenyl hydroxylation. We have suggested that this is due to the stabilization and/or improved positioning of the flavin (C4a)-hydroperoxide toward the substrate (18Meyer A. Schmid A. Held M. Westphal A.H. Ro¨thlisberger M. Kohler H.-P.E. van Berkel W.J.H. Witholt B. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 5575-5582Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). This enhanced hydroxylation efficiency was completely destroyed by the D222V substitution: in HbpAind, the uncoupling was twice that of the wild-type protein with 2-hydroxybiphenyl as substrate, whereas the unproductive NADH oxidation rate was similar in both enzymes. The single mutant HbpAD222V even showed a 3-fold increased uncoupling, which was concomitant with a 3-fold increased unproductive NADH oxidation rate. Thus, the substitution D222V in HbpAind and HbpAD222V directly increased the ratio of flavin (C4a)-hydroperoxide decay to 2,3-dihydroxybiphenyl formation (Fig. 8). This ratio is primarily influenced by stabilization of the flavin (C4a)-hydroperoxide, solvent access to the active site, and the reactivity of the substrate toward electrophilic attack by the terminal oxygen of the peroxide. According to the structural model of HbpA (18Meyer A. Schmid A. Held M. Westphal A.H. Ro¨thlisberger M. Kohler H.-P.E. van Berkel W.J.H. Witholt B. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 5575-5582Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), Asp222 is located close to the bound substrate in the substrate-binding domain. Interestingly, Asp222 of HbpA corresponds to Tyr201 of p-hydroxybenzoate hydroxylase from Pseudomonas fluorescens (39Gatti D.L. Palfey B.A. Lah M.S. Entsch B. Massey V. Ballou D.P. Ludwig M.L.

Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 10161-10170Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Inp-hydroxybenzoate hydroxylase, Tyr201 is critically involved in the ionization of the substrate, thus affecting flavin movement and allowing efficient hydroxylation (41Palfey B.A. Moran G.R. Entsch B. Ballou D.B. Massey V. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 1153-1158Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 42Gatti D.L. Entsch B. Ballou D.P. Ludwig M.L. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 567-578Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The substitution Y201F results in an increased uncoupling of NADH oxidation from substrate hydroxylation up to 95% (43Entsch B. Palfey B.A. Ballou D.P. Massey V. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 17341-17349Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In phenol 2-monooxygenase from Trichosporon cutaneum, Tyr289 is hydrogen-bonded with the hydroxyl group of the substrate, comparable to Tyr201 in p-hydroxybenzoate hydroxylase (44Enroth C. Neujahr H. Schneider G. Lindqvist Y. Structure. 1998; 6: 605-617Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Substitution of this residue by Phe increased the uncoupling from 10 to 34% (45Xu D. Ballou D.P. Massey V. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 12369-12378Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). With respect to the localization of Asp222 in the HbpA model, the chemical properties of this residue, and the effects resulting from its substitution, it is likely that Asp222 plays a similar role in HbpA as do the tyrosine residues in p-hydroxybenzoate hydroxylase and phenol 2-monooxygenase. In summary, we characterized the HbpAind mutant monooxygenase, the first flavoprotein able to hydroxylate indole. These investigations point to the importance of Asp222 in the catalytic cycle of HbpA. Thus, the results obtained here may serve as the basis for further elucidation of the mechanism of substrate activation in this enzyme. We thank Dr. E. Wehrli (ETH Zurich) for performing the electron microscopy."
https://openalex.org/W2032274963,"Procollagen C-proteinase enhancer (PCPE) is an extracellular matrix glycoprotein that binds to the C-propeptide of procollagen I and can enhance the activities of procollagen C-proteinases up to 20-fold. To determine the molecular mechanism of PCPE activity, the interactions of the recombinant protein with the procollagen molecule as well as with its isolated C-propeptide domain were studied using surface plasmon resonance (BIAcore) technology. Binding required the presence of divalent metal cations such as calcium and manganese. By ligand blotting, calcium was found to bind to the C-propeptide domains of procollagens I and III but not to PCPE. By chemical cross-linking, the stoichiometry of the PCPE/C-propeptide interaction was found to be 1:1 in accordance with enzyme kinetic data. The use of a monoclonal antibody directed against the N-terminal region of the C-propeptide suggested that this region is probably not involved in binding to PCPE. Association and dissociation kinetics of the C-propeptide domains of procollagens I and III on immobilized PCPE were rapid. Extrapolation to saturation equilibrium yielded apparent equilibrium dissociation constants in the range 150-400 nM. In contrast, the association/dissociation kinetics of intact procollagen molecules on immobilized PCPE were relatively slow, corresponding to a dissociation constant of 1 nM. Finally, pN-collagen (i.e. procollagen devoid of the C-terminal propeptide domain) was also found to bind to immobilized PCPE, suggesting that PCPE binds to sites on either side of the procollagen cleavage site, thereby facilitating the action of procollagen C-proteinases."

Cellular responses to diverse signaling events often require the activation of genes that were previously maintained in an inactive state. Factors that can rearrange or alter chromatin structure may therefore be required for such activation events.

In the case of muscle differentiation, MyoD-mediated conversion of fibroblasts to muscle-like cells and induction of muscle-specific gene expression was abrogated by prior expression of ATPase-deficient alleles of BRG1 or BRM, which resulted in the formation of dominant negative SWI/SNF enzymes (31de la Serna I.L.

Despite the requirement for SWI/SNF enzymes in activation of muscle-specific gene expression, MyoD-mediated induction of several cell cycle regulators was unaffected by the absence of functional SWI/SNF enzymes (32de la Serna I.L. Roy K. Carlson K.A. Imbalzano A.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 41486-41491Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). This suggested that the chromatin remodeling activities of the SWI/SNF enzymes are differentially required during muscle differentiation and that the mechanisms by which MyoD activates muscle-specific genes and up-regulates cell cycle regulatory proteins are distinct. MyoD is a basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor that interacts with the ubiquitous E box-binding proteins E12, E47, and HEB to form functional heterodimers (38Brennan T.J. Olson E.N.

Three other MyoD-related mygenic regulatory factors (MRFs)1 have been identified as follows: Myf5, MRF4, and myogenin (43Wright W.E. Sassoon D.A. Lin V.K.

Each of these factors has highly related DNA-binding and helix-loop-helix regions and each is capable of initiating muscle differentiation when ectopically expressed in other cell types. The impact of each of the four MRFs on muscle-specific gene expression in culture and on muscle differentiation during mouse development has been examined. Clearly, some functional redundancies exist; for example, deletion of either theMyoD or Myf5 gene in mice has no notable defect in skeletal muscle (49Braun T. Rudnicki M. Arnold H. Jaenisch R. Cell. 1992; 71: 369-382Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (555) Google Scholar, 50Rudnicki M.A. Braun T. Hinuma S. Jaenisch R. Cell. 1992; 71: 383-390Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (760) Google Scholar), whereas deletion of both genes results in embryos lacking myoblasts and differentiated skeletal muscle (51Rudnicki M.A. Schnegelsberg P.N. Stead R.H. Braun T. Arnold H.H. Jaenisch R. Cell. 1993; 75: 1351-1359Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1323) Google Scholar). However, during development, each MRF displays temporal and spatial differences in gene expression, and myogenin-deficient embryos form myoblasts but are unable to differentiate them into muscle (52Nabeshima Y. Hanaoka K. Hayasaka M. Esumi E., Li, S. Nonaka I. Nature. 1993; 364: 532-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (726) Google Scholar, 53Hasty P. Bradley A. Morris J.H. Edmondson D.G. Venuti J.M. Olson E.N. Klein W.H. Nature. 1993; 364: 501-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (1025) Google Scholar). In culture, MyoD and Myf5 are expressed in undifferentiated myoblasts, whereas myogenin expression occurs early during differentiation, and MRF4 is expressed during late differentiation or post-differentiation (reviewed in Refs. 54Buckingham M.E. Curr. Opin. Genet. & Dev. 1994; 4: 745-751Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 55Sassoon D.A. Dev. Biol. 1993; 156: 11-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 56Ludolph D.C. Konieczny S.F. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 1595-1604Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). In addition, MRF4 shows a more restricted ability to trans-activate muscle-specific genes in culture (57Chakraborty T. Brennan T. Olson E. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 2878-2882Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 58Yutzey K.E. Rhodes S.J. Konieczny S.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 3934-3944Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Comparison of the ability of MyoD, Myf5, and myogenin to induce the activation of endogenous muscle-specific genes from chromatin revealed that myogenin was much less efficient at gene activation than were MyoD or Myf5 (44Edmondson D.G. Olson E.N. Genes Dev. 1989; 3: 628-640Crossref PubMed Scopus (600) Google Scholar, 59Gerber A.N. Klesert T.R. Bergstrom D.A. Tapscott S.J. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 436-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). This difference was recently mapped to specific residues in the basic helix-loop-helix domains of these proteins (60Bergstrom D.A. Tapscott S.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 2404-2412Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Thus it is likely that the four MRFs have distinct functions during muscle differentiation. In light of the differences between individual MRFs, we introduced each MRF into fibroblasts that inducibly express dominant negative versions of the SWI/SNF ATPases BRG1 or BRM. We then determined whether activation of muscle-specific and cell cycle-regulated genes by each of the four MRFs required SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling enzymes. The results demonstrate that activation of muscle-specific genes uniformly required SWI/SNF enzymes, whereas activation of cell cycle regulators and induction of cell cycle arrest uniformly did not. pBABE-MyoD and 4R-tkCAT were described previously (61Novitch B.G.

The Myf5 cDNA was excised by digestion with BamHI and EcoRI and cloned intoBamHI/EcoRI-digested pBABE to create pBABE-mouse Myf5. Cell lines that inducibly express the Tet-VP16 regulator (Tet-VP16), dominant negative BRM (H17), or dominant negative BRG1 (B22) were maintained and induced by removal of tetracycline (Sigma) as described previously (31de la Serna I.L.

To generate retrovirus, BOSC23 cells were cultured in 100-mm dishes and transfected at 80% confluence with FuGENE (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) with 10 μg of pBABE-MyoD, pBABE-mouse Myf5, pBABE-MRF4, pBABE-Myogenin, or the empty vector (pBABE). Viral supernatants were harvested 48 h after transfection. Dishes (60 mm) of B22, H17, and Tet-VP16 cells grown in the presence of tetracycline at 50% confluence were infected individually with equal volumes of each different virus in DMEM containing 10% calf serum, 4 μg/ml of Polybrene, and 2 μg/ml tetracycline in a final volume of 5 ml. Each dish was split 1:3 48 h after infection, and the media were replaced with DMEM containing 10% calf serum, 2 μg/ml puromycin, and 2 μg/ml tetracycline. Following drug selection, each infected cell line was split 1:4 into DMEM plus 10% calf serum containing or lacking tetracycline and differentiated as described (31de la Serna I.L. Carlson K.A.

Antibodies against the FLAG epitope (M2) and Rel B were from Sigma and Santa Cruz Biotechnology, respectively. The anti-cyclin D3 antibody was obtained from Signal Transduction Laboratories. Total cellular RNA was isolated by Trizol (Invitrogen) as described by the manufacturer. Northern analysis was performed as described (32de la Serna I.L. Roy K. Carlson K.A. Imbalzano A.N. J. Biol.

The entire cDNAs encoding MyoD, MRF4, and Myf5 were excised from pEMSV-MyoD, pEMSV-MRF4, and pIC 19H and used as probes.

For the transfection experiments, the 4RtkCAT reporter gene plasmid and a control CMV-βgal plasmid were transfected using Superfect (Qiagen) 24 h prior to the onset of differentiation. CAT and β-galactosidase assays were performed as described (31de la Serna I.L. Carlson K.A. Imbalzano A.N. Nat. Genet. 2001; 27: 187-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar, 64Javed A.

CAT signal was normalized to β-galactosidase signal. Cells were grown and differentiated as described above and then fixed as described (66Kowalik T.F. DeGregori J. Schwarz J.K. Nevins J.R. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 2491-2500Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Incorporation of propidium iodide was determined by flow cytometry. We previously created NIH 3T3-based cell lines that stably incorporate inducible, ATPase-deficient alleles of either the BRG1 or BRM catalytic subunit of mammalian SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling enzymes. In the absence of tetracycline, these cells express the mutant ATPases, which associate with other SWI/SNF subunits and generate non-functional SWI/SNF complexes that act as dominant negatives (35de la Serna I.L.

Previous studies utilizing these cell lines revealed a requirement for SWI/SNF complexes for full induction of the endogenous Hsp70gene in response to some but not all environmental stresses and demonstrated that the expression of several constitutively expressed genes were unaffected by the dominant negative complexes (35de la Serna I.L.

Subsequent studies demonstrated that SWI/SNF enzymes were absolutely required for induction of the myogenic differentiation pathway mediated by introduction of the MyoD regulator (31de la Serna I.L. Carlson K.A. Imbalzano A.N. Nat. Genet. 2001; 27: 187-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar, 32de la Serna I.L. Roy K. Carlson K.A. Imbalzano A.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 41486-41491Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). To further understand the initiation of myogenesis and the myogenic regulatory proteins that mediate this process in this in vitro differentiation model, we sought to compare the requirement for SWI/SNF enzymes when differentiation was induced by each of the four myogenic regulators MyoD, Myf5, MRF4, and myogenin. Our previous studies examining MyoD-induced differentiation utilized a retroviral vector (pBABE (67Morgenstern J.P. Land H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 3587-3596Crossref PubMed Scopus (1898) Google Scholar)) to introduce MyoD. For these comparative studies, we cloned the Myf5, MRF4, and myogenin cDNAs into this vector and used the derived retroviruses to initiate the myogenic program in cell lines expressing or not expressing dominant negative BRG1 (B22 cells) or dominant negative hBRM (H17 cells). The parental cell line tet-VP16, which encodes the tetracycline-regulated transactivator but no target gene under tetracycline operator control, was used as a control. Cells infected with the empty pBABE vector served as an additional control. Fig.1 demonstrates that FLAG-tagged mutant BRG1 was inducibly expressed in the differentiated B22 cells, and FLAG-tagged mutant hBRM was inducibly expressed in the differentiated H17 cells. Expression levels of the mutant ATPase alleles were similar for each cell line regardless of the retroviral vector utilized. As expected, no FLAG immunoreactivity was observed in the tet-VP16 cells. Because these cell lines are derived from NIH 3T3 cells, they do not fuse upon differentiation to form myotubes as do many other fibroblasts, thus our analysis involved molecular detection of myogenic markers. Among the four myogenic regulators, myogenin can be induced by the other three factors; however, MyoD, Myf5, and MRF4 typically do not induce the expression of each other in cell culture models of muscle differentiation. Initial experiments therefore analyzed levels of MyoD, Myf5, and MRF4 in tet-VP16 control and B22 and H17 dominant negative cell lines that were infected with retroviruses encoding each of the four MRFs. Tet-VP16 cells infected with the Myf5, MyoD, or MRF4 retrovirus produced only mRNA for the gene encoded by the retrovirus (Fig. 2, A andB). Identical results were obtained upon infection of the dominant negative cell lines (Fig. 2, A and B). The presence or absence of tetracycline did not affect the level of MRF mRNA, indicating that the dominant negative SWI/SNF enzymes did not affect retroviral integration or expression from the viral promoter (Fig. 2, A and B; see also Ref. 31de la Serna I.L. Carlson K.A. Imbalzano A.N. Nat. Genet. 2001; 27: 187-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). As expected, infection with the empty pBABE vector did not result in expression of any of these MRFs. In each of these blots we observed only one band for each MRF mRNA, and each was slightly larger than the size expected for mRNA transcribed from the endogenous gene (data not shown). Because the retrovirus generates a transcriptional fusion between retroviral gag gene and the MRF cDNA, this indicates that the ectopic expression of Myf5, MyoD, or MRF4 did not activate transcription from the respective endogenous loci.

The junD gene contains no introns and generates a single mRNA. Here we show that two predominant JunD isoforms are generated by alternative initiation of translation, a 39-kDa full-length JunD protein (JunD-FL) by initiation at the first AUG codon downstream of the mRNA 5′ cap and a shorter, 34-kDa JunD protein (ΔJunD) by initiation at a second in-frame AUG codon. The JunD mRNA contains a long, G/C-rich 5′-untranslated region that is predicted to be highly structured and is important for regulating the ratio of JunD-FL and ΔJunD protein expression. A third functional out-of-frame AUG directs translation from a short open reading frame positioned between the JunD-FL and ΔJunD start sites. In addition, three non-AUG codons also support translation, an ACG codon (in-frame with JunD) and a CUG are positioned in the 5′-untranslated region, and a CUG codon (also in-frame with JunD) is located downstream of the short open reading frame . Mutation of these start sites individually had no affect on ΔJunD protein levels, but mutation of multiple upstream start sites led to an increase in ΔJunD protein levels, indicating that these codons can function cumulatively to suppress ΔJunD translation. Finally, we show that the JunD mRNA does not possess an internal ribosome entry site and is translated in a cap-dependent manner.

Mice lacking c-Jun or JunB are not viable, whereas mice lacking JunD are viable with only mild growth defects and some abnormalities in spermatogenesis (10Hilberg F. Aguzzi A. Howells N. Wagner E.F.

Overexpression of c-Jun or JunD exerts antagonistic effects on fibroblasts; c-Jun promotes cell proliferation and cooperates with activated ras to transform cells, whereas JunD overexpression slows cell growth and antagonizes transformation by ras (13Schutte J.

Olsen A.S. Houslay M.D. Cell Signal. 1999; 11: 735-742Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The JunD mRNA encodes two ubiquitously expressed protein isoforms, JunD-FL and ΔJunD, generated by translational initiation at two AUG codons that are in-frame with one another (20Okazaki S. Ito T., Ui, M. Watanabe T. Yoshimatsu K. Iba H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 250: 347-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). A small out-of-frame AUG-initiated open reading frame (μORF)1is positioned between these two AUG codons. We show that in addition to these three AUG codons, three non-AUG start codons are functional for initiation of translation, a CUG and an ACG, located within the 5′-untranslated region (5′-UTR), and a CUG that resides between the JunD-FL and ΔJunD start sites. Thus, a total of six translation start sites reside within the rodent JunD mRNA. The JunD mRNA also contains a long, G/C-rich 5′-UTR that is predicted to have a low free energy of folding and to be highly structured (1Ryder K. Lanahan A. Perez-Albuerne E. Nathans D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 1500-1503Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar, 2Berger I. Shaul Y. Oncogene. 1991; 6: 561-566PubMed Google Scholar, 21Sehgal A. Briggs J. Rinehart-Kim J. Basso J. Bos T.J. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 2836-2845Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Previous studies reveal that long, structurally encumbered UTRs can be inhibitory to cap-dependent translation (22Kozak M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 19867-19870Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23Pain V.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 236: 747-771Crossref PubMed Scopus (638) Google Scholar). In this study, we have investigated the role of the JunD 5′-UTR and the unusually large number of functional initiation start codons in controlling translation of the JunD-FL and ΔJunD isoforms. Our results demonstrate that the JunD 5′-UTR is important in regulating the ratio of JunD-FL and ΔJunD. Furthermore, we show that the JunD mRNA is translated in a cap-dependent manner and that upstream codons act cumulatively to repress expression of the ΔJunD isoform. A human keratinocyte cell line (HaCat), human lung epithelial cell line (WI-38), simian kidney epithelial cell line (COS-1), rat osteosarcoma cell lines (UMR-106 and UMR-108), and human osteosarcoma cell lines (U2-OS and SAOS) were cultured in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (Cellgro) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (HyClone), 50 units/ml penicillin, and 50 μg/ml streptomycin (BioWhittaker). HeLa cells were cultured in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium supplemented with 10% cosmic calf serum (Hyclone), 50 units/ml penicillin, and 50 μg/ml streptomycin. For protein extraction or RNA isolation, HeLa cells were plated onto 6-well dishes at a density of 5 × 105 cells/well. For luciferase assays, HeLa, CHO, or COS-1 cells were plated onto 24-well dishes at a density of 8 × 104 cells/well. DNA (0.4 or 2 μg of total DNA/well) was transfected into 24-well dishes or 6-well dishes, respectively, using the Cytofectene transfection reagent according to the manufacturer’s protocol (Bio-Rad). Lysates for protein analysis or luciferase assays were prepared 24 h after transfection. After transfection, cells were lysed in 1× passive lysis buffer, and luciferase activity was determined using the dual luciferase assay system according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Promega) with a TD-20/20 luminometer (Turner Designs). Firefly luciferase activities were normalized using Renillaluciferase. The full-length JunD ORF was amplified using 5′-GGAATTCGCCACCATGGAAACGCCCTTCTATGGCGAG-3′ as the forward primer, a portion of the JunD ORF used to generate D-Δ1 was amplified using 5′-CGGAATTCCGGGAAACGCCCTTCTATGGCGAGGAG-3′ as the forward primer, and a portion of the JunD ORF used to generate D-Δ2 was amplified using the 5′-GGAATTCGACGAGCAGCATGCTGAAGAAAG-3′ forward primer. The rat JunD ORF was amplified by PCR using the mouse forward primer for full-length mouse JunD ORF. The human JunD open reading frame was amplified by PCR using 5′-GGAATTCCGGAGGATGGAAACACCCTTCTACGGC-3′ as the forward primer. The 5′-CCCAAGCTTGGGTACGCCGGGACCTGGTGCTGG-3′ primer served as the reverse primer for PCR of the JunD fragments described above. PCR products were subcloned into the pcDNA 3.1(−)myc-hisB (pcDNA3.1-MHB) expression vector (Invitrogen) after digestion with EcoRI and HindIII restriction enzymes. Rat JunD or human JunD sequences containing the wild-type 5′-untranslated region were amplified by PCR as follows. A BsiWI restriction site was generated upstream of the pcDNA3.1-MHB TATAA region using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis protocol according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Stratagene). The rat JunD cDNA from the TATAA region through the 3′ end of the ORF was amplified by PCR using 5′-CCCGTACGGGCTATAAGAGTGCGCGCGGG-3′ and 5′-CCCAAGCTTGGGTACGCCGGGACCTGGTGCTGG-3′ as forward and reverse primers, respectively. The human cDNA from the TATAA region to the 3′ end of the ORF was amplified by PCR using 5′-CCCGTACGGGCTATAAGAGGGCGCACAAG-3′ and 5′-CCCAAGCTTGGGTACGCCGGGACCTGGTGCTGG-3′ as forward and reverse primers, respectively. PCR products were subcloned into the modified pcDNA3.1MHB vector after digestion with BsiWI andHindIII. Site-directed mutagenesis of JunD constructs was performed using the QuikChange protocol, and all mutations were verified by ABI sequence analysis (Texas Tech University Biotechnology Institute). The sequence of specific mutagenesis primer pairs can be obtained upon request. Dicistronic constructs were generated as follows. An XhoI restriction site was generated in the pRL-CMV expression vector (Promega) downstream of the Renilla luciferase open reading frame. The 5′-CCGCTCGAGAGAGCGGCCGGCATCGGAGC-3′ forward primer and 5′-CAGAGACCATGGTGCTGCTCGTTGGGGGCGCC-3′ reverse primer were used to amplify the 5′ region of rat JunD that contained the S1 mutation. The PCR product was subcloned into pGL3-Basic expression vector (Promega) after digestion with XhoI and StyI.XhoI and BamHI were then used to digest an insert containing the JunD 5′ region, firefly luciferase ORF, and SV40 poly(A) signal from the pGL3-Basic vector. The insert was then subcloned into the modified pRL-CMV vector after digestion with XhoI andBamHI. The dicistronic construct containing the encephalomyocarditis virus insert was a kind gift from Dr. Kathleen Boris-Lawrie and was described previously (24Roberts T.M. Boris-Lawrie K. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 8111-8118Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). A hairpin structure was inserted into the dicistronic constructs by first generating anEcoRI site within the pRL-CMV promoter region upstream of the Renilla luciferase ORF. Next, a primer (5′-CCGGAATTCGATATCCCCTTGGACCTCCGTACCCTGCAGG-3′) containing a modified synthetic stem-loop structure was denatured at 95 °C for 5 min and placed on ice for 20 min (21Sehgal A. Briggs J. Rinehart-Kim J. Basso J. Bos T.J. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 2836-2845Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The primer was extended using Klenow polymerase I at 16 °C for 1 h and was then digested withEcoRI, gel-purified, and subcloned into the dicistronic-EcoRI plasmids. Whole cell extracts were prepared using 0.5% SDS lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, 0.5% SDS, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, all reagents from Sigma) as described previously (18Lallemand D. Spyrou G. Yaniv M. Pfarr C.M. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 819-830Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Mouse tissue extracts were a gift from the lab of Dr. C. MacDonald. Total protein concentration was normalized using the Bio-Rad protein assay reagent. Equal amounts of cellular protein were denatured in sample buffer at 95 °C, separated by electrophoresis on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels, and blotted to nitrocellulose membrane (Schleicher & Schuell). Blots were preincubated for 1 h at room temperature using phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.1% Tween 20 (PBST) supplemented with 5% nonfat dry milk. Primary antibodies were diluted in PBST with 1% bovine serum albumin and incubated at room temperature for 1 h. After washing with PBST, an appropriate peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (Jackson Laboratories) was diluted in PBST with 1% bovine serum albumin and incubated for 1 h at room temperature. Peroxidase-conjugated antibody complexes were visualized with SuperSignal chemiluminescent substrate (Pierce). The Myc epitope was detected using a mouse anti-Myc antibody (Invitrogen) diluted 1:5000. JunD proteins were detected using either a rabbit anti-JunD antibody (Santa Cruz #329, 0.2 μg/ml) or a rabbit anti-JunD antibody described previously (15Pfarr C.M. Mechta F. Spyrou G. Lallemand D. Carillo S. Yaniv M. Cell. 1994; 76: 747-760Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). Total cellular RNA was isolated using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). RNA (10 μg) was separated by electrophoresis on 1% agarose gels containing formaldehyde and transferred to nylon membrane (Schleicher & Schuell). Membranes were hybridized overnight with 2.5 × 106 cpm of DNA probe in modified Church’s buffer (0.25 mNa2HPO4, pH 7.2, containing 7% SDS) (25Church G.M. Gilbert W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 1991-1995Crossref PubMed Scopus (7266) Google Scholar). After incubation, membranes were washed with 1× SSC and 0.1% SDS at 65 °C and then exposed to a PhosphorImager screen for 6–15 h. Signal was detected using a PhosphorImager instrument (Model 445SI, Molecular Dynamics). A DNA probe corresponding to the myc-his region was generated as follows. The myc-his region of pcDNA3.1 MHB was amplified by PCR using 5′-AAGCTTTCTAGAACAAAAACTC-3′ as the forward primer and 5′-TCAATGATGATGATGATGATG-3′ as the reverse primer. The PCR fragment was denatured and labeled with [α-32P]dCTP using the All-in-One labeling kit according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Sigma). To examine endogenous JunD protein levels, whole cell extracts were generated from mouse tissues and a variety of mammalian cell lines. Tissue extracts were probed with a commercially available rabbit polyclonal antibody specific for a C-terminal peptide of JunD (Santa Cruz #329) (Fig. 1A), and cell line extracts were probed with a rabbit polyclonal antibody directed against amino acids 1–114 of JunD (Fig. 1B) (15Pfarr C.M. Mechta F. Spyrou G. Lallemand D. Carillo S. Yaniv M. Cell. 1994; 76: 747-760Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). Both of these antibodies are highly specific, with no detectable cross-reaction to the other Jun proteins, and both antibodies yielded similar results (data not shown). Each of the extracts contained two isoforms of JunD. The larger isoform, full-length JunD (JunD-FL), was detected at 39 kDa, and a smaller isoform, ΔJunD, was detected at 34 kDa (20Okazaki S. Ito T., Ui, M. Watanabe T. Yoshimatsu K. Iba H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 250: 347-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). All tissue extracts expressed JunD-FL and ΔJunD at approximately equal stoichiometries; however, the ratio of JunD-FL to ΔJunD varied somewhat between cell lines. HaCat, U2-OS, and HeLa cells expressed JunD-FL and ΔJunD at approximately a 1:1 ratio, whereas SAOS, UMR-106, UMR-108, and WI-38 cells expressed JunD-FL at slightly higher levels than ΔJunD (Fig. 1B). Sequence analysis of the JunD mRNA revealed three potential AUG initiation codons positioned within good Kozak contexts to support translational initiation. These three start codons are conserved between chicken, rodents, and human (Fig. 2B). The first AUG (S1) in the JunD mRNA downstream of the 5′ cap gives rise to JunD-FL (1Ryder K. Lanahan A. Perez-Albuerne E. Nathans D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 1500-1503Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar). The third AUG downstream of the 5′ cap (S3) is in-frame with JunD-FL, and the predicted protein size generated from the S3 start site is comparable with the ΔJunD isoform seen in Fig. 1(Fig. 2A). The second AUG downstream of the 5′ cap (S2) is out-of-frame with JunD-FL. (Fig. 2B). If translated, the S2 ORF (referred to here as the μORF) would encode a 3–5 amino acid product depending upon species (Fig. 2A).Figure 2Three conserved AUG codons are present in the human, rodent, and chicken JunD mRNAs.A, schematic of three potential open reading frames beginning with each AUG found within JunD mRNAs. The length of the corresponding protein or peptide for each species is indicated in the table at theright. The S1 and S3 ORFs generate JunD-FL and ΔJunD, respectively. B, sequence comparison of the flanking sequences of the AUG start codons within JunD mRNA molecules. Sequences annotated with an asterisk are good Kozak matches, with a purine at −3 and at +4.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To determine whether the S3 codon can direct translation of the ΔJunD protein, synthetic mouse JunD constructs, D-WT, D-Δ1, and D-Δ2, were created. The synthetic constructs contained an Myc epitope in-frame with the C terminus of JunD, allowing direct detection of exogenous JunD proteins by Western blot analysis. The D-WT construct possessed each of the three AUG codons shown in Fig. 2B. D-Δ1 contained the S2 and S3 codons, and D-Δ2 contained only the S3 codon (Fig. 3A). The D-WT, D-Δ1, and D-Δ2 constructs were transfected into HeLa cells, and expression was analyzed by Western blots probed with a mouse monoclonal antibody specific for the Myc epitope. The D-WT plasmid produced both JunD-FL and ΔJunD isoforms. The D-Δ1 and D-Δ2 constructs did not produce JunD-FL, but both generated the ΔJunD isoform (Fig.3C, lanes 1–3). To directly test the involvement of the S3 AUG in ΔJunD expression, this codon was mutated to UUA. Independently, the −3 and −2 positions of the S3 Kozak sequence were mutated to pyrimidine residues to decrease the efficiency of any translational initiation from the S3 start codon (Fig. 3B) (26Kozak M. Cell. 1986; 44: 283-292Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3598) Google Scholar). The S3 AUG mutant construct was incapable of generating ΔJunD, and the S3 Kozak mutation nearly abolished ΔJunD protein expression (Fig. 3C, lanes 4 and 5). Taken together, these data indicate that JunD-FL translation is initiated at the S1 AUG and ΔJunD translation is initiated at the S3 codon. To determine whether the μORF affected translation of ΔJunD, the S2 AUG was mutated to an ACG codon to prohibit translational initiation. Independently, the μORF stop codon was mutated to a UGG codon to prevent termination of ribosomes that had translated the μORF (Fig.4A). Wild-type and mutant constructs were transfected into HeLa cells, and cell lysates were analyzed by Western blotting. Neither the μORF start codon mutant nor stop codon mutant significantly altered the expression of ΔJunD or JunD-FL (Fig. 4B). To determine whether the S2 AUG supported ribosomal initiation, mouse, rat, and human constructs that correspond to D-WT shown in Fig.3A were used to generate frameshift mutations. A single nucleotide was inserted into the μORF stop codon, placing the μORF in-frame with ΔJunD and placing the S1 AUG out-of-frame with ΔJunD. This frameshift mutation allowed ribosomes initiating translation at the S2 codon to elongate and generate a μORF-JunD hybrid protein (S2 product) in-frame with the C-terminal Myc epitope that was predicted to be slightly smaller than JunD-FL. Subsequently, the frameshift mutant constructs were used to generate a double mutant that also contained the S2 AUG mutation (AUG to ACG) (Fig.5A). Mouse, rat, and human frameshift mutants generated a Myc-reactive S2 (μORF) protein product and ΔJunD product but did not generate JunD-FL (Fig. 5B, lanes 2, 5, and 8; the S2 product is depicted by an asterisk). Mutation of the μORF start codon (S2) led to ablation of the μORF protein products (Fig.5B, lanes 3, 6, and 9), indicating that the S2 (μORF) product is created through ribosomal initiation at the S2 AUG codon. Interestingly, neither the frameshift mutation nor the double mutation significantly altered the ΔJunD protein level when compared with D-WT (Fig. 5B). To verify that the S2 product was the predicted hybrid JunD protein, Western blotting was also performed using a JunD-specific antibody. The S2 protein product generated by frameshift mutations within the rodent and human synthetic constructs was also recognized by this JunD antibody (Fig. 5C, lanes 2, 5, and8). Consistent with the anti-Myc pattern, the S2 product was abolished by mutation of the S2 start codon (Fig.5C, lanes 3, 6, and 9). The 5′-UTR of the JunD mRNA is a long (120 and 138 nucleotides in rodent and human, respectively) G/C-rich sequence that is predicted to have a low free energy of folding (21Sehgal A. Briggs J. Rinehart-Kim J. Basso J. Bos T.J. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 2836-2845Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Both the rat and human 5′-UTRs from the mRNA 5′ cap to the S1 AUG codon were analyzed using mfold software (27Mathews D.H. Sabina J. Zuker M. Turner D.H. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 288: 911-940Crossref PubMed Scopus (3232) Google Scholar, 28Zuker M. Mathews D.H. Turner D.H. Barciszewski J. Clark B.F.C. RNA Biochemistry and Bio/Technology. Kluwer Academic Publishers, Norwell, MA1999: 11-43Google Scholar). The rat and human UTR structures had comparably low ΔGo values (within 11% of each other). The predicted structures of lowest free energy for the rat and human 5′-UTRs both possess three dominant stem-loop structures, with the first stem-loop positioned only 2–3 nucleotides from the JunD mRNA 5′ cap (Fig.6). To more accurately assess the role of the 5′-UTR in JunD mRNA translation, plasmid constructs were generated that possessed the complete rat or human wild-type 5′-UTR (JunD 5′-UTR) including the JunD TATAA box (Fig.7A). Constructs containing the JunD wild-type 5′-UTR and D-WT constructs that contained a 5′-untranslated region from the pcDNA3.1 plasmid were transfected into HeLa cells. RNA samples were isolated and analyzed by Northern blots hybridized with a DNA probe specific for the myc-his region of the mRNA. Comparable levels of mRNA were expressed by the D-WT and JunD-5′-UTR constructs (Fig. 7B, bottom panel). Western blotting indicated that JunD-FL protein levels were reduced in cells transfected with the JunD 5′-UTR constructs, accompanied by a corresponding change in the ratio of JunD-FL to ΔJunD (Fig. 7B, top panel). The expression ratio of JunD-FL/ΔJunD was ∼1:1 from JunD-5′-UTR constructs, a ratio similar to that found for the endogenous JunD isoforms (Fig. 1). These data indicate that the JunD 5′-UTR has a role in determining the ratio of JunD-FL and ΔJunD in cells and that the JunD-5′-UTR constructs are a better model with which to study JunD translation.Figure 7Presence of the JunD 5′-UTR changes the JunD-FL/ΔJunD protein ratio.A, schematic diagram of JunD-myc constructs containing the complete wild-type JunD 5′-untranslated region of the rat and human JunD mRNAs. B, rat or human D-WT constructs, which possess a synthetic 5′-untranslated region from the pcDNA3.1 vector or constructs depicted in A were transfected into HeLa cells, and whole cell extracts were analyzed for expression of Myc-tagged JunD isoforms by Western blotting (upper panel). Total RNA was analyzed by Northern blots probed with a myc-specific probe (lower panel).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The rat JunD-5′-UTR construct was used to determine whether the S2 codon supported translation initiation in the context of the JunD 5′-UTR. Mutations corresponding to those shown in Fig. 5A were introduced into the rat JunD-5′-UTR construct, and expression from these plasmids was tested in HeLa cells. A Myc-reactive S2 product resulted from the frameshift mutation that placed the S2 AUG in-frame with the S3 (ΔJunD) AUG. Similar to the D-WT constructs, the S2 product was abolished by mutation of the μORF start codon (Fig.8D, lane 4). Mutation of the S2 AUG codon alone or the μORF stop codon in the JunD-5′-UTR construct had no affect on JunD-FL or ΔJunD protein levels (data not shown). The JunD-5′-UTR construct containing a frameshift mutation also generated an Myc-reactive band that migrated at a higher molecular weight than JunD-FL (A1 product) (Fig. 8D, lane 2). This was surprising since there are no other AUG codons upstream of the S1 AUG codon. To determine the origin of the higher molecular weight product, the rat JunD mRNA sequence upstream of the S1 AUG was analyzed for potential non-AUG start codons. A putative alternative initiation codon, CUG (A1), within the JunD 5′-UTR that was in-frame with the μORF was identified. Mutation of this A1 codon ablated the slower migrating Myc-reactive band (Fig. 8D, lane 3), indicating that this CUG supported translation initiation within the rat JunD 5′-UTR. Expression from the wild-type rat JunD-5′-UTR construct in HeLa cells generated the expected JunD-FL and ΔJunD protein, but two additional myc-reactive bands were found in highly expressing cells, a band migrating slower than JunD-FL and a band migrating between JunD-FL and ΔJunD (Fig. 8C, lane 1). The JunD mRNA was examined for additional alternative initiation codons that were in-frame with JunD-FL and ΔJunD. An ACG within the JunD 5′-UTR (A2) just downstream of the A1 start site and a CUG codon (A3) just downstream of the μORF stop codon were found at positions that could explain these additional in-frame JunD products. Mutations were introduced that disrupted these two putative alternative start sites. Mutation of the A2 start codon abolished expression of the high molecular weight product (Fig. 8C, lane 2), and mutation of the A3 codon abolished expression of the smaller protein (Fig. 8C, lane 4). One additional potential alternative start codon, a CUG located 25 nucleotides from the mRNA 5′ cap, was also mutated, but this had no affect on the expression of the A2 product (data not shown). Taken together, these data demonstrate that the rat JunD mRNA has multiple sites of translation initiation that occur at both AUG and non-AUG start codons. Each of the start codons within the rat JunD-5′-UTR construct was mutated to a non-start codon (Fig. 8B). Mutation of the A1 codon led to increased A2 protein levels, and the S2 mutation led to increased A3 protein levels. However, the single mutation of any upstream start codo"

A key component is the multifunctional LcrV protein, which is present on the bacterial surface prior to host cell contact and up-regulates translocation by blocking the repressive action of the LcrG protein on the cytosolic side of the secretion apparatus.

Van Gijsegem F. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 2000; 54: 735-774Crossref PubMed Scopus (642) Google Scholar). This mechanism plays a key role in the infection process of bacterial pathogens including Chlamydia sp., enteropathogenic and enterohemorraghic Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Shigella sp., and Yersinia sp. (2Hueck C.J. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1998; 62: 379-433Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This system is a sec-independent pathway and is composed of approximately 20 proteins, a number of which are transiently assembled to form a “molecular syringe” that often results from a signal released upon contact with the target cell (2Hueck C.J. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1998; 62: 379-433Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This syringe structure is responsible for the translocation of protein “effectors” that can cause a range of signaling and cytoskeletal changes upon the target cell, ultimately leading to, for example, intracellular invasion of a macrophage or apoptosis (3Bliska J.B. Galán J.E. Falkow S. Cell. 1993; 73: 903-920Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar, 4Miller J.F. Cossart P. Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 1999; 2: 15-17Crossref Google Scholar). The type III secretion system of Yersinia was the first to be discovered and is the best characterized to date. Therefore, it is considered to be the prototypical type III system. The genes encoding these proteins are located on plasmid pYV, which is present in all three human pathogenic Yersinia species, i.e. Yersinia pseudotuberculosis, Yersinia enterocolitica, and Yersinia pestis. TheseYersinia species resist the primary host immune defense by inhibiting macrophage phagocytosis (2Hueck C.J. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1998; 62: 379-433Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This inhibition is mediated by the type III secretion system and thus allows infection by extracellular localization (5Neyt, C., Cornelis, G. R., Society for General Microbiology Symposium, Microbial Signaling And Communication, England, R. R., Hobbs, G., Bainton, N. J., Roberts, D. McL., 57, 1999, 215, 240, Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, United Kingdom.Google Scholar). The secretion machinery is principally composed of the Yersinia outerproteins (Yops),1the Yersinia secretion apparatus (Ysc), andspecific Yop chaperones (Syc) (6Cornelis G.R. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 5495-5504Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A key component of the Yersinia type III secretion apparatus is the V antigen or LcrV, a 37-kDa protein, the expression of which is transcriptionally up-regulated at 37 °C upon infection of the host or in vitro in the absence of calcium (7Price S.B. Cowan C. Perry R.D. Straley S.C. J. Bacteriol. 1989; 171: 5646-5653Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It is a protective antigen of Y. pestis (8Burrows T.W. Bacon G.A. Br. J. Exp.

Van Gijsegem F. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 2000; 54: 735-774Crossref PubMed Scopus (642) Google Scholar). LcrV has several putative roles in Yersinia type III secretion and Yersiniapathogenicity in general that are probably mediated by self-interactions (multimerization) or interactions with other proteins. LcrV has been proposed to assemble into a membrane-associated extracellular structure, which facilitates the transfer of Yop effector proteins into the eukaryotic cytosol, and is surface-located prior to target cell contact (10Pettersson J. Holmström A. Hill J. Leary S. Frithz-Lindsten E. von Euler-Matell A. Carlsson E. Titball R. Forsberg Å Wolf-Watz H. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 32: 961-976Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Thus, the extracellular localization of LcrV on the bacterial membrane may provide a prime position from which to control Yop targeting (10Pettersson J. Holmström A. Hill J. Leary S.

LcrV further promotes protein secretion and targeting through an interaction with YopB and YopD, possibly enabling their deployment for pore formation within the eukaryotic membrane (11Sarker M.R. Neyt C. Stainier I. Cornelis G.R. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 1207-1214Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, it has recently been demonstrated that LcrV is both extracellularly localized and translocated into the host cell cytosol (12Fields K.A. Straley S.C. Infect. Immun. 1999; 67: 4801-4813Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). LcrV has been predicted to contain a coiled-coil motif (13Pallen M.J. Dougan G. Frankel G. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 25: 423-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) composed of a repeating 7-residue signature sequence, indicative of the formation of a superhelix from two or more α-helices (reviewed in Refs. 14Burkhard P. Stetefeld J. Strelkov S.V. Trends Cell Biol. 2001; 11: 82-88Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (840) Google Scholar and15Lupas A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 375-382Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1008) Google Scholar). Coiled-coils have been suggested to represent a key structural feature required for the formation of the multiprotein complexes involved with the type III secretion apparatus (13Pallen M.J. Dougan G. Frankel G. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 25: 423-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), and it has been suggested that the interaction of LcrV with the LcrG protein may be mediated through the formation of a coiled-coil (13Pallen M.J. Dougan G. Frankel G. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 25: 423-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Genetic approaches such as the yeast-two hybrid system have been used to identify strong interactions between type III pathway proteins such as that observed between the EspA (filament-forming protein) and EspD (translocation pore proteins) of enteropathogenic E. coli(16Daniell S.J. Delahay R.M. Shaw R.K. Hartland E.L. Pallen M.J. Booy F. Ebel F. Knutton S. Frankel G. Infect. Immun. 2001; 69: 4055-4064Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). In Yersinia, similar experiments have demonstrated an interaction between LcrV and an inhibitory gate protein to the Ysc apparatus, LcrG (17Nilles M.L. Williams A.W. Skrzypek E. Straley S.C. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 1307-1316Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Overexpression of LcrG inhibits Yop secretion even in the presence of LcrV (18Nilles M.L. Fields K.A. Straley S.C. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 3410-3420Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Hence a “titration model” has been proposed whereby the up-regulation of LcrV during the low calcium response allows binding to LcrG, thus removing the internal gating of the Ysc apparatus (18Nilles M.L. Fields K.A. Straley S.C. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 3410-3420Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A site-directed mutant of LcrG was also recently reported that failed to demonstrate an interaction with LcrV using a yeast two-hybrid system. This variant was able to block secretion of LcrV and Yops, further supporting the hypothesis that the formation of an LcrV·LcrG complex is required for Yop secretion (19Matson J.S. Nilles M.L. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 5082-5091Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). In this context, elucidation of details of molecular interactions involved in LcrV complex formation is fundamental to understanding secretion processes in Yersinia pathogenesis. However, a lack of any quantitative protein interaction information has motivated us to produce pure folded recombinant forms of these proteins. Using these materials, we report the relative affinities of LcrV for itself and for LcrG. In addition, the availability of such materials has afforded us the opportunity to produce site-directed mutants of LcrV within the predicted coiled-coil motif and subsequently assess the importance of this motif both in terms of LcrG interaction and Yop secretion. Therefore, the present investigation provides the first quantitative characterization of type III secretion protein-protein interactions and a more detailed molecular description of LcrV and LcrG folding and complex formation, which complements previous genetic approaches. Oligonucleotides were purchased from Sigma. Media reagents Luria Broth (LB) and Brain-Heart infusion were obtained from Merck. Isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside was from Genesys (London, UK).

Dextran-coated CM5 sensor chips and detergent P20 were purchased from BIAcore (Uppsala, Sweden). Suprasil cuvettes were from Helma Kuvetten (Mulheim, Germany). All antibodies for enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and Western blotting, apart from mouse anti-LcrV (Defence Science and Technology Laboratory, Wiltshire, United Kingdom), were purchased from Sigma. Marvel dried skimmed milk powder used as a source of casein was from Premier Beverages (Stafford, United Kingdom). All other chemicals were purchased from Sigma. Plasmids pGEX-V and pGEX-G are pGEX-5X1 derivatives (Amersham Biosciences). Both plasmids encode Schistozoma japonicum glutathioneS-transferase (GST), a linker peptide containing a protease cleavage site, and either the Y. pestis LcrV (pGEX-V) or LcrG (pGEX-G) proteins. The genes encoding lcrV andlcrG were ligated into the EcoRI-NotI sites of the pGEX-5X-1 vector. pGEX-V was generated by aPfu-based PCR of lcrV using Primer1 (5′-ATCGAATTCATTAGAGCCTACGAACAAAAC-3′), which contains anEcoRI restriction site upstream of the second codon (ATT), and Primer2 (5′-ACATAGTATAGCGGCCGCGTGTCATTTACCAGACGT-3′), which incorporates a unique NotI site downstream of the TCA stop codon. pGEX-G was generated by a Pfu-based PCR oflcrG using Primer3 (5′-ATAGAATTCACAATAAATATCAAGACAGACAGC-3′), which contains anEcoRI restriction site upstream of the second codon (ACA), and Primer4 (5′-ACATAGTATAGCGGCCGCATATTAAATAATTTGCCCTCGCAT-3′), which contains a NotI restriction site downstream of the TAA stop codon. pGEX-V and pGEX-G were subsequently transformed into theE. coli strain BL21 (DE3) for overproduction of recombinant GST-LcrV or GST-LcrG fusion proteins, respectively. Plasmid pGEX-V was purified using the Qiagen QiaQuick Spin Miniprep kit and then used as a template to amplify the Y. pestis lcrV gene in a Pfu-based PCR. Primer1 was used with Primer5 (5′-CCCAAGCTTGTGTCATTTACCAGACGT-3′), which incorporates a uniqueHindIII site downstream of the TGA stop codon. The 990-bplcrV fragment was ligated into the EcoRI andHindIII sites of the pTrc99A expression vector (Amersham Biosciences) to produce plasmid pTrc-LcrV. Initial clones were obtained by heat-shock transformation (21Sambrook J Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) into E. colistrain BL21 (DE3). PCR-based mutagenesis of lcrV was performed using the primer overlap method. In all cases, Primer1 was used in conjunction with a “mutagenic” primer containing a site-directed mutation to generate a PCR fragment encoding from the 5′ end of the gene to a few bases downstream of the mutation site. A second PCR fragment was generated from a few bases upstream of the mutation site using an overlapping primer, complementary around the mutation site, in combination with Primer2. Each PCR was carried out using pGEX-V as the template. Fragments generated were gel-purified and subjected to a second round of PCR using Primer1 and Primer2 to generate a fragment containing the entire lcrV gene with the mutations of choice. Each fragment was then ligated into the EcoRI and NotI sites of the GST fusion vector pGEX-5X-1 and transformed (21Sambrook J Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) into E. coli strain BL21 (DE3). The resulting plasmids were then used as templates for PCR using Primer1 and Primer5 as described above. The resulting PCR fragments were subsequently ligated into theEcoRI and HindIII sites of the pTrc99A expression vector. All mutants constructed in the lcrV gene contained the CGT codon encoding an arginine residue at positions within the DNA sequence predicted to encode the coiled-coil motif of interest. The presence of desired mutations within the lcrVgene was confirmed by sequencing the pGEX-5X-1-lcrV plasmids with an automated Applied Biosystems 377 DNA Sequencer (Foster City, CA using the dideoxy method with BigDye Terminator Ready Reaction Kits (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Identification of the putative coiled-coil motifs in LcrV and LcrG was made using the COILS program (ulrec3.unil.ch/coils/COILS_doc.html) (22Lupas A. Van Dyke M. Stock J. Science. 1991; 252: 1162-1164Crossref PubMed Scopus (3458) Google Scholar,23Lupas A. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1997; 7: 388-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). A 28-residue window size was used with weighting in favor of hydrophobic residues at the a and d positions of the heptad repeat. The MATCHER program (cis.poly.edu/∼jps/) (24Fischetti G.M. Landau J.P. Schmidt P. Sellers V.A. Information Processing Letters. 1993; 45: 11-18Crossref Scopus (40) Google Scholar) was also used to determine whether a protein sequence contains the 7-residue periodicity ([aXXdXXX]n) associated with coiled-coils. Secondary structure predictions were conducted using PHDsec from EMBL (www.embl-heidelberg.de/Services/index.html). GST, GST-LcrG, GST-LcrV, and GST-LcrV mutant proteins were purified with minor modifications to a previously described protocol (20Leary S.E.C. Williamson E.D. Griffin K.F. Russell P. Eley S.M. Titball R.W. Infect. Immun. 1995; 63: 2854-2858Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Two liters of LB containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin were inoculated with 50 ml of an overnight culture ofE. coli BL21 (DE3) transformed with the appropriate pGEX derivative. Cells were grown at 37 °C with shaking for 2 h and then induced with isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside to a final concentration of 1 mm. Growth was allowed to continue for another 4 h. Centrifugation of the culture yielded a cell pellet that was resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) (0.01m phosphate buffer, 0.0027 m KCl, 0.137m NaCl, pH 7.4). Cells were lysed by sonication, and insoluble material was removed by centrifugation at 12,000 ×g for 45 min. 6 ml of 50% (w/v) glutathione-Sepharose 4B in PBS were added to the cell lysate supernatant (typically 12 ml) and incubated at 4 °C for 1 h with rotation. The material was transferred into a plastic column and washed with 100 ml of PBS. GST and GST-LcrV proteins were eluted after this stage by resuspending the glutathione-Sepharose in 6 ml of 10 mm glutathione in 100 mm Tris HCl, pH 8.0, and collecting the flow-through from the column. Otherwise, the glutathione-Sepharose with bound fusion proteins was resuspended in 6 ml of PBS. Proteolytic cleavage to release LcrV or LcrG was conducted by adding 200 μl of 100 μg/ml Factor Xa in PBS followed by incubation at 4 °C for 16 h with rotation. Cleaved protein was collected as flow-through from the column. The column was then washed to retrieve all of the protein released. Proteins produced from Factor Xa cleavage all contained five N-terminal residues (GIPEF) prior to the second encoded residue of the predicted protein sequence. Pooled samples of LcrV were concentrated in Centriprep-YM10 concentrators, whereas pooled LcrG samples required Centriprep-YM3 concentrators. Protein concentrations were determined by Bradford assay. Protein purity was estimated by 8–25% SDS-PAGE, and for LcrV and LcrG by MALDI-MS at the Mass Spectrometry Facility, Department of Biochemistry, University of Bristol (Bristol, United Kingdom). Circular dichroism (CD) measurements were performed on an AVIV 62DS spectropolarimeter. The instrument was calibrated with camphor sulfonic acid for optical rotation and benzene vapor for wavelength. Data were recorded at 0.2-nm intervals and at 25 °C in a temperature-controlled chamber. Samples of LcrV wild type and mutants (4 mg/ml in PBS), LcrG (9 mg/ml in PBS), GST (6 mg/ml in PBS), GST-LcrV (4 mg/ml in PBS), or base lines consisting of PBS were examined in 0.001-cm path length Suprasil cuvettes. A minimum of five scans was collected for every sample. Individual scans were smoothed with a Savitsky-Golay filter (25Savitzky A Golay M.J.E. Anal. Chem. 1964; 36: 1627-1639Crossref Scopus (14764) Google Scholar), and the averaged base-line spectrum was subtracted from the averaged sample spectrum. Mean residue molecular weights of 114.2 for LcrV, 110.2 for LcrG, 116.7 for GST, and 115.1 for GST-LcrV were used in the calculations of mean residue ellipticity. Spectra were analyzed using the Dichroweb server (26Lobley A. Whitmore L. Wallace B.A. Bioinformatics. 2002; 18: 211-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (643) Google Scholar). Reference data sets 4 and 7 (27Sreerama N. Woody R.W. Anal. Biochem. 2000; 282: 252-260Crossref Scopus (2487) Google Scholar, 28Sreerama N. Vanyaminov S.Y. Woody R.W. Anal. Biochem. 2000; 287: 243-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (503) Google Scholar), which were compatible with the wavelength range obtainable in this study, were used. To test the reliability of the determinations, a number of alternative algorithms were used for the structure calculations: SELCON3 (29Sreerama N. Woody R.W. Anal. Biochem. 1993; 209: 32-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (944) Google Scholar, 30Sreerama N. Vanyaminov S.Y. Woody R.W. Protein Sci. 1993; 8: 370-380Crossref Scopus (638) Google Scholar), CONTIN (31Provencher S.W. Glockner J. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 33-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (1871) Google Scholar, 32Van Stokkum I.H.M. Spoelder H.J.W. Bloemendal M. Van Grondelle R. Groen F.C.A. Anal. Biochem. 1990; 191: 110-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar), and CDSSTR (27Sreerama N. Woody R.W. Anal. Biochem. 2000; 282: 252-260Crossref Scopus (2487) Google Scholar). As a means of comparison of the goodness-of-fit of the various methods, the NRMSD parameter (34Mao D. Wachter E. Wallace B.A. Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 4960-4968Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar) was calculated. NRMSD is defined as: Σ[(θexp-θcal)2/(θexp)2]1/2summed over all wavelengths, where θexp and θcal are, respectively, the experimental ellipticities, and the ellipticities of the back-calculated spectra for the derived structure. NRMSD values of <0.1 mean that the back-calculated and experimental spectra are in close agreement (35Brahms S. Brahms J. J. Mol. Biol. 1980; 138: 149-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (709) Google Scholar). A low NRSMD is not sufficient to indicate a correct analysis, but a poor (high) NRMSD generally means the analysis is not correct. In this study, all values were well below 0.1. Calculations of standard deviations between measurements were performed at all wavelengths to determine the variation within a data set. Purified protein samples were analyzed using 8–25% polyacrylamide gradient Phast gels on a Phast electrophoresis system (Amersham Biosciences). SDS and native gels were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue using the Phast system developer unit. Protein interaction studies involved the co-incubation of LcrG with LcrV or GST-LcrV at an estimated 2:1 molar ratio at 4 °C for 30 min prior to visualization on a native 8–25% gel. Identification of protein secretion patterns from Y. pseudotuberculosis was done using 14% homogeneous polyacrylamide gels using a Novex Mini-gel system (Novex, San Diego, CA). 25 μl of 5× concentrated protein loading buffer (62.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 2% SDS (w/v), 5% β-mercaptoethanol (v/v)) were used to resuspend protein samples, which were then boiled for 10 min. 10-μl samples were electrophoresed on gels in a Tris-glycine buffer (21Sambrook J Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Proteins were separated on an 8–25% gradient Phast gel and transferred onto a nitrocellulose Hybond-P membrane, which was blocked overnight at 4 °C with 5% casein in PBST (PBS containing 0.05% Tween 20 (v/v)). LcrV was detected using a mouse-generated anti-LcrV antibody diluted 1:3000 in PBST + 5% casein and incubated for 1 h at room temperature. After washing, membranes were incubated with an anti-mouse horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibody (1:10,000 in PBST) for 1 h at room temperature. Horseradish peroxidase was detected using ECL reagents and visualized by exposure of Kodak X-Omat AR film. ELISA methods were used to analyze interactions between GST-LcrV and LcrV (self-association), GST-LcrV and LcrG, and LcrV and LcrG based upon related studies of the enteropathogenic E. coli EspA protein (36Delahay R.M. Knutton S. Shaw R.K. Hartland E.L. Pallen M.J. Frankel G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35969-35974Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The self-association of LcrV was assayed by incubating 100 μl of aliquots of LcrV at 20 μg/ml in carbonate/bicarbonate buffer (0.05m carbonate/bicarbonate buffer, pH 9.6) in an ELISA plate at 4 °C overnight. Wells were washed three times with 200 μl of PBST and blocked with 200 μl of 2% (w/v) casein in PBST for 1 h at 37 °C. 70 μl of GST-LcrV at concentrations ranging from 0.2 to 2 mg/ml in PBST containing 1% casein (w/v) were added to wells and incubated at 37 °C for 1.5 h. After washing, 70 μl of rabbit anti-GST IgG (1:5000 dilution in PBST) were added to each well for 1 h at 37 °C. Further washing was followed by 70 μl of alkaline phosphatase-conjugated anti-rabbit antibody (1:5000 dilution in PBST) being added to wells and incubated for 1 h at 37 °C. The reaction was visualized by adding 70 μl of 1 mg/mlρ-nitrophenylphosphate in 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 9.5, and observing the optical density measured at 405 nm after 20 min. The mean optical density and mean ± S.D. were calculated from triplicate experiments, and the K D was estimated using a GST-LcrV molecular mass of 64,000 and a single-site ligand binding model (Grafit v3.09, Erithacus Software Ltd., United Kingdom). The interaction of GST with immobilized LcrV was measured as a control for nonspecific binding. The association of GST-LcrV with LcrG was assayed as just described with the exception that LcrG was immobilized at 20 μg/ml to the ELISA plate and that subsequent incubation with GST-LcrV was performed at concentrations ranging from 0.19 to 100 μg/ml. The interaction of GST with immobilized LcrG was measured as a control for nonspecific binding. The LcrV·LcrG interaction was assayed by coating an ELISA plate with 100 μl of 20 μg/ml LcrG as described above. After washing, wells were blocked with 1% bovine serum albumin (w/v) in PBST. 100 μl of LcrV at concentrations between 0.07 and 80 μg/ml in PBST were added to the wells for 2 h at 37 °C. Plates were washed and probed with a mouse anti-LcrV monoclonal antibody (1:2000 dilution in PBST at 37 °C for 1 h) followed by alkaline phosphatase-conjugated anti-mouse antibody (1:2000 dilution, 37 °C for 1 h). The reaction was visualized, and the K D was estimated using an LcrV molecular mass of 37,000 as described above. LcrV binding to the ELISA plate was used as a control. The affinity of LcrV for LcrG was determined using surface plasmon resonance (SPR) (37Markey F. BIAJournal. 1999; 1: 14-16Google Scholar) in a BIAcore X instrument with dextran-coated CM5 sensor chips. LcrG at 15 μg/ml in a sodium acetate/acetic acid buffer, pH 6.0, was immobilized to a CM5 chip by amine coupling (38BIAcore Ltd. (2001) BIAtechnology Handbook, pp. 41–45, Upsala, Sweden.Google Scholar). The injection of 100 μl of 0.1–1.2 μm wild type and mutant LcrVs in HEPES-buffered saline (10 mm HEPES, 150 mm NaCl, 0.01% (w/v) detergent P20) was performed at a flow rate of 20 μl/min. The binding surface was regenerated with 30 μl of 10 mm HCl at 20 μl/min, which restored the base-line response level without degradation of the sensor chip. The binding of LcrV at all concentrations to the CM5 dextran chip alone was subtracted from the experimental data as a control. In addition, LcrV at 15 μg/ml in a sodium acetate/acetic acid buffer, pH 6.0, was immobilized to a CM5 chip by amine coupling (38BIAcore Ltd. (2001) BIAtechnology Handbook, pp. 41–45, Upsala, Sweden.Google Scholar). The injection of 100 μl of 0.7–8.0 μm wild-type LcrG in HEPES-buffered saline was performed at a flow rate of 20 μl/min. The binding surface was regenerated with 30 μl of 10 mm HCl at 20 μl/min. The binding of LcrG at all concentrations to the CM5 dextran chip alone was subtracted from the experimental data as a control. Sensorgrams were analyzed using the BIAevaluation 3.0 package (BIAcore, Uppsala Sweden) to derive values for association rate constants (k a) and dissociation rate constants (k d) by simultaneously fitting several data sets, consisting of injections over a range of ligand concentrations using simple 1:1 Langmuir binding models with the global fitting option. TheK D value was derived fromk d /k a. A second estimate of theK D was derived from a plot of the response levels at equilibrium against protein concentration. A steady-state affinity model was used to fit the curve. Analyses of secretion patterns of Yops in Y. pseudotuberculosis were conducted according to a previously described method (10Pettersson J. Holmström A. Hill J. Leary S. Frithz-Lindsten E. von Euler-Matell A. Carlsson E. Titball R. Forsberg Å Wolf-Watz H. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 32: 961-976Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar).

Nutrients are absorbed by enterocytes, the most abundant intestinal epithelial cells, which differentiate and express a variety of specific genes as they exit the crypt and migrate toward the tip of the villus.

Several transcription factors are thought to be involved in the regulation of gut-specific gene expression, based on their pattern of expression. However, the transcriptional mechanisms involved are still poorly understood.In vitro studies with the enterocyte-like cell line Caco-2 indicated that the transcription factors hepatic nuclear factor 1 (HNF-1),1 HNF-4, Cdx-2, and GATA-4, -5, and -6 may be involved in the expression of several intestine-specific genes, including sucrase isomaltase (10Boudreau F.

The apolipoprotein (apo) A-I/C-III/A-IV gene cluster is a useful model for studies of the molecular mechanisms controlling the specific pattern of gene transcription along the crypt-to-villus and cephalo-caudal axes of the intestine. The human apoA-IV gene is specifically expressed in villus enterocytes (19Elshourbagy N.A. Boguski M.S. Liao W.S.L. Jefferson L.S. Gordon J.I. Taylor J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Within the cluster, located on chromosome 11, the apoA-I and A-IV genes are transcribed in the same direction, whereas the apoC-III gene is transcribed in the opposite direction. Therefore, the apoC-III/A-IV intergenic region constitutes a common 6.6-kilobase pair 5′-flanking region for both genes (21Zannis V.I. Cole F.S. Jackson C.L. Kurnit C.L. Karathanasis S.K. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 4450-4455Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Previous studies have shown that the −780/−580 enhancer region of the apoC-III gene directs the intestinal expression of the three genes of the cluster (20Le Beyec J. Chauffeton V. Kan H.-Y.

In vitro, both nuclear hormone receptors and orphan receptors are able to bind the HRE (24Lavrentiadou S.N. Hadzopoulou-Cladaras M. Kardassis D. Zannis V.I. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 964-975Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Specific mutations in this HRE abolish intestinal expression of the apoA-I and apoC-III genes (25Kan H.-Y. Georgopoulos S. Zannis V.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 30423-30431Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). However, although the apoC-III enhancer is necessary to direct the intestinal expression of the cluster, it is not sufficient to restrict gene expression to villus cells, as observed for the endogenous gene. This suggests that other regulatory sequences are involved in conferring the pattern of expression of apolipoprotein genes observed in the intestine in vivo. We identified the −700/−310 distal region of the apoA-IV promoter as such a regulatory region. This region, in combination with the proximal promoter and the −890/−500 apoC-III enhancer, is necessary and sufficient to restrict the expression of both the apoC-III and apoA-IV genes to villus enterocytes (20Le Beyec J. Chauffeton V. Kan H.-Y. Janvier P.-L. Cywiner-Golenzer C. Chatelet F.-P. Kalopissis A.D. Zannis V.I. Chambaz J. Pinçon- Raymond M. Cardot P. J. Biol.

The aim of this study was to define the cis-regulatory sequence or sequences involved in this spatial pattern of intestine-specific expression. DNase I footprint analysis of the −700/−310 distal region of the apoA-IV promoter using mouse enterocyte nuclear factors led to the identification of a conserved HRE binding site. We demonstrated in vivo with a new set of transgenic mice that deletion of this HRE abolished the villus-specific gene expression. In parallel, we showed that this HRE bound the HNF-4α and -γ isoforms, which display differential patterns of production along the crypt-to-villus axis. The epithelium was isolated from villi as described by Perreault and Beaulieu (26Perreault N. Beaulieu J.F. Exp. Cell Res. 1998; 245: 34-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Briefly, the small intestine was everted, washed twice in phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.2 (PBS), and cut into 5 mm fragments. Fragments were incubated overnight in 10 ml Matrisperse (BD PharMingen) at 4 °C without shaking. The fragments were then shaken gently, and the isolated cells were filtered and washed twice with cold PBS. Crypt cells were isolated by shaking intestine fragments in a chelating buffer, as described by Flint et al. (27Flint N. Cove F.L. Evans G.S. Biochem. J. 1991; 280: 331-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Nuclear extracts from intestinal epithelial cells were then prepared as previously described (28Shapiro D.J. Sharp P.A. Wahli W.W. Keller M.J. DNA (N. Y.). 1988; 7: 47-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar). COS-1 cells were transfected with vectors encoding HNF-4α, ErbA-related protein 3/chicken ovalbumin upstream promoter transcription factor (COUP-TFI), and apoA-I regulatory protein-1/COUP-TFII by the calcium phosphate co-precipitation method. Whole-cell extracts were prepared as previously described for use in gel retardation assays (29Ladias J.A. Hadzopoulou-Cladaras M. Kardassis D. Cardot P. Cheng J. Zannis V.I. Cladaras C. J. Biol.

The DNA probes used in footprint analysis were obtained by PCR using the eCIII-AIV-CAT plasmid previously described (20Le Beyec J. Chauffeton V. Kan H.-Y. Janvier P.-L. Cywiner-Golenzer C.

For each amplification by PCR, either the 5′ or the 3′ primer was labeled with T4 polynucleotide kinase and [γ-32P]ATP. DNase I footprint analysis was carried out as previously described (30Ogami K. Hadzopoulou-Claradas M. Claradas C. Zannis V.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 9808-9815Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with mouse enterocyte nuclear extract. The oligonucleotides used in this study were AIV3c, 5′-−533GGTGTACCTTGACAAGAGACCTAGA−509-3′, and AIV3nc, 5′-324CTCGAGGCATCAGTCCCGGGCT−303-3′ (Set A) and AIV4c 5′-−700ATCCCATTGTTCAGAGGAGAAACT−677-3′, and AIV4nc, 5′-−499CACTATGCTGTCTGCAGTCCTGGA−477-3′ (Set B). The human AIVE and mouse AIVE double-stranded oligonucleotides were used for EMSA as probes or competitors. The human AIVE and mouse AIVE correspond, respectively, to the human element E, between nucleotides −377 and −357 (5′-GGGAGATGTGGACTTTGCCCCCCATGAGCCC-3′) of the apoAIV promoter, and its homolog in mice, between nucleotides −146 and −114 (5′-GGGAGACTTGGACCTTGTTCTCTCAGACT-3′) (GenBankTM gi:192006). EMSAs were performed according to the protocol of Fried and Crothers (31Fried M.G. Crothers D.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1984; 172: 263-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar), as described by Lacorteet al. (32Lacorte J.-M. Fourniat E. Pastier D. Chambaz J. Ribeiro A. Cardot P. Biochem.

For competition assays, oligonucleotides were added in a 100-fold molar excess. Supershift experiments were performed with antibodies directed against HNF-4α (C-19X) and HNF-4γ (C-18X), according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.). The −700/−410 apoA-IV promoter region was amplified by PCR using oligonucleotides spanning the −700 to −680 sequence with anXbaI restriction site and the −410 to −387 sequence withXbaI and BamHI restriction sites as sense and antisense primers, respectively. The resulting apoA-IV fragment was digested with XbaI, gel-purified, and inserted into theXbaI site of the C3-CAT plasmid (20Le Beyec J. Chauffeton V. Kan H.-Y. Janvier P.-L. Cywiner-Golenzer C.

The dA4ΔΕ-C3-CAT plasmid was sequenced to check that the cloning had been successful, and the transgene was excised from the plasmid by digestion with BamHI and gel-purified. The transgene (6 ng/μl) was microinjected into fertilized eggs from C57BL/6J × CBA/J females mated with males of the same strain according to standard procedures (33Le Beyec J. Benetollo C.

Founder mice were identified by extracting DNA from the tails of 10–15-day-old pups and analyzing it by PCR with oligonucleotide primers corresponding to sequences +163 to +189 (coding strand) and +696 to +670 (non coding strand) of the CAT gene. Founder mice were further analyzed by Southern-blotting, and copy number was estimated by densitometric scanning of autoradiographs as previously described (33Le Beyec J. Benetollo C. Chauffeton V. Domiar A. Lafrenière M.-J. Chambaz J. Cardot P. Kalopissis A.D. Transgenics. 1998; 2: 211-220Google Scholar). F0 mice expressing the dA4ΔΕ-C3-CAT transgene were out-bred to generate lines of heterozygous mice. Individual tissues samples were homogenized and assayed for CAT activity as previously described (20Le Beyec J. Chauffeton V. Kan H.-Y. Janvier P.-L. Cywiner-Golenzer C. Chatelet F.-P.

The soluble protein concentration was determined with the Bio-Rad protein assay. The proportion of chloramphenicol converted to acetylated forms was determined by scraping individual spots from the thin-layer chromatogram and counting them in a scintillation counter. CAT activity is expressed as % acetylation/min/mg of protein after subtracting the background for each tissue from control mice, which do not express the CAT gene Adult mice were killed by cervical dislocation. The entire small intestine was rapidly removed and divided into three parts corresponding to the proximal, middle, and distal regions of the small intestine. Samples were immediately embedded in tissue-freezing medium (Tissue-TEK) and frozen in isopentane cooled by liquid N2. In situ hybridization was performed with a modified version of the method of Braissant et al.(34Braissant O. Foufelle F. Scotto C. Dauca M. Wahli W. Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 354-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (1737) Google Scholar). Tissue sections (12 μm) were cut at −20 °C and mounted on superfrost slides (Menzel-Glazer). Sections were fixed by incubation for 10 min in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS at 4 °C. They were then incubated twice for 15 min each in 0.1% active diethyl pyrocarbonate in PBS and equilibrated by incubation for 15 min in 5× SSC (1× SSC = 0.15 m NaCl and 0.015 msodium citrate, pH 7.0) supplemented with 0.1% active diethyl pyrocarbonate. Sections then incubated for 2 h at 58 °C in 50% formamide, 5 × SSC, 40 μg/ml salmon sperm DNA and then hybridized by incubation for 40 h at 58 °C in the same mixture to which 106 cpm of antisense or sense CAT riboprobe was added per slide. Sense and antisense CAT riboprobes were synthesized using T7 and T3 RNA polymerases, respectively, incorporating [α-33P]UTP. The template used to produce the two riboprobes was a linearized pSK-CAT plasmid containing a 265-bp fragment of the CAT gene (20Le Beyec J. Chauffeton V. Kan H.-Y. Janvier P.-L. Cywiner-Golenzer C.

Slides were washed for 30 min in 2× SSC at room temperature, 1 h in 2× SSC at 65 °C and twice, for 30 min each, in 0.1× SSC at 65 °C. Sections were then dehydrated in a graded series of ethanol solutions to achieve total desiccation and dipped in Hypercoat LM1 emulsion. Slides were stored in the dark at 4 °C for 1–4 days and then developed. Images were recorded with a Zeiss Axiophot microscope. Jejunal sections (7 μm) were cut at −20 °C and mounted on foil-covered microscope slides (Leica). Sections were rapidly stained with methyl green and dried at 37 °C. Laser microdissection was performed, with an AS LMD Leica Laser microdissection system used to collect crypt and villus cells. Total RNA was extracted from crypt and villus samples with the Absolutely RNA nanoprep kit (Stratagene), and first-strand cDNA was generated with SensiScript reverse transcriptase (Qiagen) using random hexamer primers. The cDNAs were used for PCR amplification with CAT sense 5′-TATCCCAATGGCATCGTAAAGA-3′ and antisense 5′-GGTATTCACTCCAGAGCGATG-3′ primers. We amplified the 18 S RNA gene as a control for RNA extraction and reverse transcription with sense 5′-ACGRACCAGAGCGAAAGCAT-3′ and antisense 5′-GGACATCTAAGGGCATCACAGAC-3′ primers. PCR products were detected by Southern blot analysis using CAT or 18 S DNA as a probe. The 18 S DNA probe was used as an internal standard (data not shown). Sections of small intestine from mice were fixed by incubation for 10 min in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS and washed 6 times for 5 min each in PBS. The sections were incubated for 30 min in blocking solution (2% bovine serum albumin, 0.2% Tween, 100 mm glycine in PBS) and then for 1 h at room temperature with anti-HNF-4 isoform antibodies (rabbit anti-HNF-4α, dilution 1/250, kindly provided by Dr. M. Pontoglio and goat anti-HNF-4γ, dilution 1/5000, C-18X from Santa Cruz). The sections were washed six times with PBS, then incubated with blocking solution followed by secondary antibodies either anti-rabbit RITC (dilution 1/200, Dako RO156) or anti-goat Cyc3 (dilution 1/300, Sigma, C2821). After several washings the samples were mounted with antifading mixture Fluoprep (Biomerieux). Images were acquired with a Zeiss LSM-510 laser-scanning confocal microscope (Carl Zeiss, Oberkochem, Germany) equipped with a Zeiss Axiovert 100 M (plan neofluar 16× NA 0.5 oil immersion objective). We previously reported that the −700/−310 distal promoter region of the human apoA-IV gene was required to confer on a reporter gene the specific pattern of expression of the endogenous apoA-IV gene along the cephalocaudal and crypt-to-villus axes of the intestine (20Le Beyec J. Chauffeton V. Kan H.-Y. Janvier P.-L. Cywiner-Golenzer C. Chatelet F.-P. Kalopissis A.D. Zannis V.I. Chambaz J. Pinçon- Raymond M. Cardot P. J. Biol.

In vitro DNase I footprinting analysis of this distal region using nuclear extracts prepared from mouse intestinal epithelial cells identified four protected regions, designated E to G, at positions −377 to −356, −458 to −430, −585 to −523, and −640 to −610, respectively (Fig.1, A–C). Footprints E and H were flanked by 4 and 2 DNase I hypersensitive sites, respectively. Another hypersensitive site was detected on the non-coding strand, within footprint G (Fig. 1B). Comparison of the sequences of the human and mouse distal apoA-IV promoter regions (nucleotide −700 to −310, GenBankTM accession numbers gi:178756 and gi:192006), using the BLAST sequence alignment program, showed the two sequences to be 64% identical within footprint E (Fig. 1D), whereas no significant identity was found between the human and mouse sequences for the other footprints (data not shown). Footprint E contains a putative HRE, conserved in the human and mouse promoters, with a direct repeat 1 (DR1) (Fig. 1D). Electrophoretic mobility shift assays using extracts from COS-1 cells producing HNF-4α, apoA-I regulatory protein-1, and ErbA-related protein 3 revealed that these factors bound to this motif in footprint E (Fig.2). Thus, the motif identified in footprint E actually functions as an HRE.Figure 2Binding of members of a nuclear receptor family to the human AIVE element. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays were performed with extracts from mock-transfected COS-1 cells (−) or COS-1 cells transfected with the indicated expression vectors. The double-stranded labeled probe corresponded to human footprint E. The assay was performed as described under “Experimental Procedures.” EAR3, ErbA-related protein 3;ARP-1, apo A-I regulatory protein-1.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We investigated whether this distal HRE was involved in the specific pattern of expression of the apoA-IV gene by generating dA4ΔE-C3-CAT transgenic mice. These mice expressed the CAT reporter gene under the control of the −890/+24 apoC-III promoter (C3) fused to the distal −700/−410 fragment of the apoAIV promoter (dA4), the −377/−357 HRE (ΔE) thus being deleted (Fig.3B). Three founder mice, each of which expressed 10–20 copies of the dA4ΔE-C3-CAT transgene, were identified. The pattern of expression of the reporter gene in the intestine was determined for each founder (Fig. 4) and compared with that of the three previously published transgenic mice expressing the CAT reporter (i) under the control of the human −890/+24 apoC-III promoter (C3-CAT), (ii) under the control of the −890/+24 apoC-III promoter fused to the −310/−700 apoA-IV distal promoter region (dA4-C3-CAT), and (iii) under the control of the −500/−890 apoC-III promoter fused to the −700/+10 apoA-IV promoter (eC3-A4-CAT) (schematic diagram in Fig. 3A). The last two of this transgenic lines displayed similar patterns of transgene expression. In dA4ΔE-C3-CAT mice, CAT activity was constant and similar in the proximal, middle, and distal segments of the intestine (Fig. 4A), as observed in C3-CAT mice (20Le Beyec J. Chauffeton V. Kan H.-Y.

Conversely, we observed a gradient of CAT activity, decreasing along the cephalocaudal axis, in mice expressing the dA4-C3-CAT transgene that retained the distal apoA-IV HRE (20Le Beyec J.

Thus, deletion of the distal apoA-IV HRE results in abolition of the cephalocaudal gradient of expression. We analyzed CAT gene expression along the crypt-to-villus axis of dA4ΔE-C3-CAT mice byin situ hybridization. In dA4ΔE-C3-CAT mice (Fig.4B, a), CAT gene transcripts were detected in epithelial cells along the entire length of the crypt-to-villus axis but were more abundant in crypts than in villi. In eCIII-AIV-CAT mice (Fig. 4B, b), the expression of the transgene was restricted to villus cells (20Le Beyec J. Chauffeton V. Kan H.-Y. Janvier P.-L. Cywiner-Golenzer C. Chatelet F.-P.

The specificity of the signal was assessed by hybridization of the sense CAT riboprobe to jejunum sections from dA4ΔE-C3-CAT transgenic mice and of the antisense CAT riboprobe to jejunum sections from non-transgenic mice. Fig.4B, c and d, show a few scattered grains corresponding to the background signal for dark-field microscopy. The expression pattern of the CAT reporter gene was confirmed by RT-PCR analysis of mRNA isolated from villus or crypt cells obtained by laser microdissection of intestinal sections from transgenic mice (Fig. 4C). We also probed each section for 18 S RNA, to check the efficiency of RNA extraction and reverse transcription (data not shown). CAT mRNA was present in both crypt and villus cells from dAIVΔE-CIII-CAT mice but was detected only in villus cells from eCIII-AIV-CAT mice. Overall, these results demonstrate that deletion of the distal apoA-IV HRE abolishes intestinal villus-specific gene expression. We carried out electrophoretic mobility shift and antibody-mediated supershift assays with nuclear extracts prepared from mouse intestinal villi to identify the intestinal transcription factors that bound to the distal apoA-IV HRE. As expected from the results shown in Fig. 2, the human distal apoA-IV HRE formed a single major complex with nuclear extracts prepared from villi (Fig.5A, lane 1). This complex was partly due to HNF-4α binding, as demonstrated by anti-HNF-4α antibody supershift assay (lane 4). However, the complex was not totally supershifted with increasing amounts of anti-HNF-4α antibody (lanes 4–6). This suggests that a number of different complexes may form with the HRE. Supershift assays were performed with several antibodies, directed against various nuclear receptors known to bind an HRE, in addition to the anti-HNF-4α antibody. ApoA-I regulatory protein-1, ErbA-related protein 3, RARα, and RXRα were not involved in these subcomplexes (data not shown). Only an antibody specifically directed against HNF-4γ resulted in a total supershift of the complex in association with the anti-HNF-4α antibody (lane 7) or a partial supershift of the complex alone (lane 8). Similar results were obtained with the mouse distal apoA-IV HRE used as a probe (Fig.5B). The anti-HNF-4γ antibody clearly did not interact with the HNF-4α isoform because no supershift of the complex formed with extracts prepared from COS-1 cells producing HNF-4α but not HNF-4γ was observed with this antibody (Fig. 5C). We investigated the specificity of villus nuclear extracts by comparing their binding pattern with that of nuclear extracts prepared from crypt cells. The crypt nuclear extracts formed an identical major complex with the distal apoA-IV HRE (Fig. 5A, lanes 9–14). Interestingly, this complex was almost completely supershifted by the anti-HNF-4α antibody (lane 12) and was supershifted to a much lesser extent by the anti-HNF-4γ antibody (lane 14). The slight supershift observed with the anti-HNF-4γ antibody may have resulted from contamination of the crypt cell fraction by the more abundant villus cells, as confirmed by a sucrase-isomaltase assay, sucrase-isomaltase activity being a specific marker of differentiated enterocytes (data not shown). These results suggest that HNF-4γ is mostly produced in the villus, whereas HNF-4α is produced in both the villus and crypts. This differential pattern of expression of HNF-4 isoforms in the intestine was confirmed by immunolocalization of the two isoforms along the crypt-to-villus axis. Immunochemical analysis with specific anti-HNF-4α and anti-HNF-4γ antibodies confirmed that endogenous HNF-4α was produced in the crypt and villus epithelial cells (Fig.6A). Conversely, HNF-4γ labeling was restricted to the villus epithelial cells (Fig.6B). Regulation of the enterocyte differentiation program involves mechanisms based on spatially restricted transcription, controlling the expression of terminal differentiation genes responsible for enterocyte function. In vivo analysis is required to improve our understanding of these mechanisms. We showed in a previous study that the distal region of the apoA-IV promoter is required to restrict apoC-III and apoA-IV gene expression to the villus enterocytes of the small intestine (20Le Beyec J. Chauffeton V. Kan H.-Y. Janvier P.-L. Cywiner-Golenzer C. Chatelet F.-P. Kalopissis A.D. Zannis V.I. Chambaz J. Pinçon- Raymond M. Cardot P. J. Biol.

In this study, we identified within this region the sequence responsible for this spatial restriction of gene expression. This sequence contains an HRE that has never before been described. HREs have also been identified in the proximal promoters of each of the genes of the apoA-I/C-III/A-IV cluster and in the apoC-III enhancer, raising questions about the respective functions of these elements.In vitro transfection assays in the hepatic HepG2 and enterocytic Caco-2 cell lines showed that transcription of the apoA-IV, apoA-I, and apoC-III genes requires the corresponding proximal HRE in each case (23Bisaha J.G.

The HRE of the apoC-III enhancer is requiredin vivo for intestinal expression of the apoA-I and apoC-III genes (25Kan H.-Y. Georgopoulos S. Zannis V.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 30423-30431Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). However, we have shown that the apoC-III enhancer is not sufficient to confer the spatial gradient of expression of the genes of this cluster (20Le Beyec J. Chauffeton V. Kan H.-Y. Janvier P.-L. Cywiner-Golenzer C. Chatelet F.-P. Kalopissis A.D. Zannis V.I. Chambaz J. Pinçon- Raymond M. Cardot P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 4954-4961Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). HREs are known to bind numerous transcription factors, particularly HNF-4α (for review, see Ref. 40Aranda A. Pascual A. Physiol. Rev. 2001; 81: 1269-1304Crossref PubMed Scopus (1142) Google Scholar). HNF-4α has been shown to be involved in the onset of intestinal development in vivo in Drosophila, in which intestinal development stops in the absence of the HNF-4α homolog (41Zhong W. Sladek F.M. Darnell J.E., Jr. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 537-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Specific inactivation of HNF-4α in the liver leads to abolition of the expression of apolipoprotein genes (42Hayhurst G.P. Lee Y.-H. Lambert G. Ward J.M. Gonzalez F.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 1393-1403Crossref PubMed Scopus (843) Google Scholar). We report here that the distal HRE of the apoA-IV promoter also binds HNF-4α. These results were obtained with crude nuclear extract obtained from intestinal villi or crypt epithelial cells. Previous studies with Caco-2 nuclear extracts show that the proximal HRE of the three genes of the cluster and the HRE of the apoC-III enhancer also bind HNF-4α (23Bisaha J.G. Simon T.C. Gordon J.I.

Biol. 1992; 12: 1708-1718Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). HNF-4α mRNA has also been detected in the epithelial cells lining both the villi and the crypts of the intestine (36Mietus-Snyder M. Sladek F.M. Ginsburg G.S. Kuo C.F. Ladias J.A. Darnell J.E., Jr. Karathanasis S.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 1708-1718Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). Our immunohistochemical analyses provide further evidence that the HNF-4α protein is present along the entire length of the crypt-to-villus axis. Therefore, HNF-4α alone is unlikely to be responsible for the spatial restriction of gene expression to villus enterocytes. Various mechanisms may account for the silencing of apolipoprotein genes in the crypt cells. First, the access of HNF-4α to the distal HRE of the apoA-IV promoter may be impeded by the structure of chromatin in this region, thereby affecting transcription in the crypt cells. Second, the activity of HNF-4α in crypt epithelial cells may be affected by the impairment of posttranscriptional modifications such as phosphorylation (43Jiang G. Nepomuceno L. Yang Q. Sladek F.M.

Cell. 2000; 5: 745-751Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar) or by specific protein-protein interactions (47Ruse M.D., Jr. Privalsky M.L. Sladek F.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 1626-1638Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Third, the transcription of apolipoprotein genes in villus enterocytes may require another HRE binding transcription factor produced in the villus but not in the crypt. HRE motifs act as binding sites for homo- or heterodimers of ligand-dependent nuclear receptors and for homodimers of orphan receptors. Using specific antibodies directed against nuclear receptors and nuclear extracts from villus epithelial cells, we showed by supershift assay that the HRE of the distal apoA-IV promoter binds only the HNF-4γ isoform in addition to the α isoform. Immunohistochemical analysis also showed that HNF-4γ was restricted to the villi. The functional role of HNF-4γ is unclear (48Drewes T. Senkel S. Holewa B. Ryffel G.U. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 925-931Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar, 49Taraviras S. Mantamadiotis T. Dong-Si T. Mincheva A. Lichter P. Drewes T. Ryffel G.U. Monaghan A.P. Schutz G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1490: 21-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Our results suggest that the ratio of HNF-4γ to HNF-4α may play a specific role in controlling the spatial pattern of gene expression along the crypt-to-villus axis in vivo. Variations of the ratio between different isoforms of transcription factors, such as HNF-1 and GATAs, have been implicated in the control of gene expression in Caco-2 cells. The differential binding of HNF-1α and -β to their target on the sucrase-isomaltase promoter plays a role in the transcriptional control of this gene (10Boudreau F. Zhu Y. Traber P.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 32122-32128Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 11Carrière V. Lacasa M. Rousset M. Biochem. J. 2001; 354: 301-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). GATA −4, −5, and −6 display differential patterns of expression in crypt and villus epithelial cells, and these factors activate intestinal genes such as intestinal fatty acid-binding protein (50Gao X. Sedgwick T. Shi Y.B. Evans T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2901-2911Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar), lactase-phlorizin hydrolase (17Fang R. Olds L.C. Santiago N.A. Sibley E. Am. J.

Van Wering H.M. Tannemaat M.R. Grand R.J. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 281: G69-G84Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) differently. In conclusion, our results demonstrate that the presence of an HRE in the distal part of the apoA-IV promoter is necessary in vivoto restrict the expression of a reporter gene to villus epithelial cells. Our results suggest that the spatial pattern of expression of apolipoprotein genes may be controlled by the HNF-4γ/HNF-4α ratio, indicating for the first time a potential role for HNF-4γ in the specific pattern of gene expression. Furthermore. in vivocell type-specific conditional gene invalidation studies will provide further insight into the respective roles of HNF-4 isoforms in the spatial pattern of gene expression in the intestine.

In mammalian cells, PC is primarily synthesized via the CDP-choline pathway, whereas in the yeastSaccharomyces cerevisiae, PE methylation is the primary route of synthesis (8Kent C. Carman G.M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1999; 24: 146-150Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). In S. cerevisiae, PE is derived from PS, which is synthesized from CDP-DAG and serine (i.e.CDP-DAG pathway) (Fig. 1) (3Paltauf F. Kohlwein S.D. Henry S.A. Jones E.W. Pringle J.R. Broach J.R.

Choline kinase (ATP:choline phosphotransferase; EC 2.7.1.32) is a cytosolic enzyme that catalyzes the committed step in the synthesis of PC by the CDP-choline pathway (9Wittenberg J. Kornberg A. J.

Because of its tractable genetics and ease of molecular manipulation,S. cerevisiae serves as an excellent eukaryotic model to study the regulation of choline kinase. The enzyme is encoded by theCKI1 gene (13Hosaka K. Kodaki T. Yamashita S. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 2053-2059Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Its deduced protein product contains a conserved phosphotransferase consensus sequence (27Brenner S. Nature. 1987; 329: 21Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2) believed to be involved in catalytic function (28Yamashita S. Hosaka K. Biochim. Biophys.

The CKI1 gene is not essential in S. cerevisiae (13Hosaka K. Kodaki T. Yamashita S. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 2053-2059Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) because PC is also synthesized by PE methylation (3Paltauf F. Kohlwein S.D. Henry S.A. Jones E.W. Pringle J.R. Broach J.R.

Nevertheless, choline kinase and the CDP-choline pathway become essential for PC synthesis when enzymes in the CDP-DAG pathway are defective (3Paltauf F. Kohlwein S.D. Henry S.A. Jones E.W.

Indeed, mutants defective in the synthesis of PS, PE, or PC are choline auxotrophs (3Paltauf F. Kohlwein S.D. Henry S.A. Jones E.W. Pringle J.R. Broach J.R.

The expression of choline kinase is regulated by growth phase and by supplementation with water-soluble phospholipid precursors (28Yamashita S. Hosaka K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1348: 63-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Choline kinase mRNA and protein levels are highest in exponential phase and decline in the stationary phase (28Yamashita S. Hosaka K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1348: 63-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Similar to other phospholipid synthetic enzymes (4Carman G.M. Henry S.A. Prog. Lipid Res. 1999; 38: 361-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar), choline kinase is repressed by the addition of inositol and choline to the growth medium (28Yamashita S. Hosaka K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1348: 63-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Yeast choline kinase is also regulated by biochemical mechanisms. Studies with purified enzyme have shown that its substrate ATP and its product ADP allosterically regulate activity (17Kim K.-H. Voelker D.R. Flocco M.T. Carman G.M. J. Biol.

ADP inhibits choline kinase activity by a mechanism that affects the catalytic properties of the enzyme and the apparent affinity the enzyme has for the substrates ATP and choline (17Kim K.-H.

Chem. 1999; 274: 9531-9538Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The enzyme is phosphorylated on multiple serine residues in vivo, and some of this phosphorylation is mediated by protein kinase A via the Ras-cAMP pathway (31Kim K.-H. Carman G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9531-9538Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). In vitro, protein kinase A phosphorylates pure choline kinase on a serine residue, and this phosphorylation results in a stimulation of choline kinase activity by a mechanism that increases catalytic turnover (31Kim K.-H. Carman G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9531-9538Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The consequence of this phosphorylation on PC synthesis is unknown and is the subject of this paper. Herein, we report the identification of Ser30and Ser85 as target sites of protein kinase A phosphorylation and show that cells bearing S30A and S85A mutations in choline kinase exhibited defects in PC synthesis via the CDP-choline pathway.

Conditions for DNA amplification by PCR were optimized as described by Innis and Gelfand (40Innis M.A. Gelfand D.H. Innis M.A. Gelfand D.H. Sninsky J.J. White T.J.

DNA sequencing reactions were performed by the dideoxy method using Taq polymerase (33Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed.

TheCKI1 S30A and CKI1 S85Awere constructed by PCR with the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit using plasmid pDO227 as the template. Plasmid pDO227 was constructed by subcloning the 2.7-kb HindIII/PstI fragment of plasmid pCK1D (13Hosaka K. Kodaki T. Yamashita S. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 2053-2059Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) into pBlueScript II. The oligonucleotides for the S30A (5′-GAGTTCTCAAAGAAGgCATgCGTTAACACGCCAAC-3′) and S85A (5′-GGGACCAAGAAGAGCtgCAGCAACTGATGTCA-3′) mutations and their complements incorporated SphI and PstI restriction sites, respectively. These silent restriction sites were used to identify plasmids with the correct mutation. A third mutagenesis reaction was performed to combine both the S30A and S85A mutations in a single allele. The mutated genes were completely sequenced to verify that no additional mutations were made. The wild-type and S30A, S85A, and S30A,S85A mutant alleles ofCKI1 were released from pDO227 by digestion withHindIII/XbaI. The resulting 2.7-kb fragments of the wild-type and mutant alleles were ligated into plasmid YEp351 to form the multicopy shuttle vectors pYY264-pYY267 and into plasmid pRS416 to form the single copy shuttle vectors pYY274-pYY277 (Table I). Plasmids YEp351 and pRS416 were digested withHindIII/XbaI before the ligations. Theeki1Δ cki1Δ double mutant strain KS106 was transformed to leucine prototrophy with the multicopy plasmids containing the wild-type and S30A, S85A, and S30A,S85A mutant alleles of CKI1. The sec14 ts cki1Δ double mutant strain KS119 was transformed to uracil prototrophy with the single copy plasmids containing the wild-type and mutant alleles of CKI1. The peptide sequence VQESRPGSVRSYSVGYQ (residues 2–18 at the N-terminal end of the deduced protein sequence of CKI1) was synthesized and conjugated to carrier protein at Bio-Synthesis, Inc. (Lewisville, TX). Antibodies were raised against the choline kinase peptide in New Zealand White rabbits by standard procedures (41Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988Google Scholar) at Bio-Synthesis, Inc. The specificity of the anti-choline kinase peptide antibodies was examined systematically by performing immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting experiments using various concentrations of antiserum and pure choline kinase. For immunoprecipitation experiments, cells were disrupted with glass beads in radioimmune immunoprecipitation buffer (50 mmTris-HCl (pH 8.0), 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS) (41Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988Google Scholar) containing protease (0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mmbenzamidine, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, 5 μg/ml leupeptin) and phosphatase (10 mm NaF, 5 mm β-glycerophosphate, and 1 mm sodium vanadate) inhibitors. 0.5 ml of cell extract (1 mg/ml protein) was precleared by incubation with 0.15 ml of protein A-Sepharose CL-4B beads (10% suspension, w/v) for 1 h at 4 °C. Following incubation, the beads were removed by centrifugation at 1,000 × g for 30 s. Choline kinase was immunoprecipitated from the cleared supernatant by incubation with 5 μl of anti-choline kinase peptide antiserum for 1.5 h followed by incubation with 0.15 ml of protein A-Sepharose CL-4B beads for 1 h. The beads were collected by centrifugation at 1,000 ×g for 30 s and washed three times with 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.0) containing 150 mmNaCl and 10 mm MgCl2. Following the washing steps, the buffer was removed by aspiration, and the choline kinase attached to the protein A-Sepharose CL-4B beads was used as substrate for protein kinase A phosphorylation. For in vivo labeling experiments, cell extracts were prepared with 50 mmTris-HCl (pH 8.0) buffer containing protease and phosphatase inhibitors. Following immunoprecipitation, choline kinase proteins were dissociated from enzyme-antibody complexes (41Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988Google Scholar), subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (42Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207018) Google Scholar), and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (43Haid A. Suissa M. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 96: 192-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). The 32P-labeled proteins were visualized and quantified by PhosphorImaging analysis. For immunoblotting experiments, protein samples on polyvinylidene difluoride membranes were probed with a 1:5000 dilution of anti-choline kinase peptide antibodies. The choline kinase protein was detected using the ECF Western blotting chemifluorescent detection kit as described by the manufacturer. The choline kinase protein on immunoblots was acquired by FluorImaging analysis. The relative density of the protein was analyzed using ImageQuant software. Immunoblot signals were in the linear range of detectability. Immunoprecipitated choline kinase and choline kinase synthetic peptides were phosphorylated with protein kinase A using the bovine heart catalytic subunit. This enzyme is structurally and functionally similar to the S. cerevisiae protein kinase A catalytic subunit (44Toda T. Cameron S. Sass P. Zoller M. Wigler M. Cell. 1987; 50: 277-287Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar) and phosphorylates pure choline kinase under zero order kinetics (31Kim K.-H. Carman G.M. J. Biol.

Reaction mixtures contained 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 60 mmdithiothreitol, 15 μm [γ-32P]ATP (4 μCi/nmol), 10 mm MgCl2, protein kinase A, and immunoprecipitated choline kinase or synthetic peptides. For samples containing the immunoprecipitated choline kinase, the reaction was terminated by the addition of 1 ml of ice-cold radioimmune immunoprecipitation buffer. The protein A-Sepharose CL-4B beads were collected by centrifugation and washed three times with the same buffer. The beads were suspended in Laemmli sample buffer and subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (42Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207018) Google Scholar) followed by transfer to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (43Haid A.

We now describe two new 19-kDa diphosphoinositol polyphosphate phosphohydrolases (DIPPs), named types 3α and 3β, which possess the canonical Nudix-type catalytic motif flanked on either side by short Gly-rich sequences. The two enzymes differ only in that Pro-89 in the α form is replaced by Arg-89 in the β form, making the latter ∼2-fold more active in vitro. Another Nudix substrate, diadenosine hexaphosphate, was hydrolyzed less efficiently (kcat/Km = 0.2 × 105m−1s−1) compared with diphosphoinositol polyphosphates (kcat/Km = 2–40 × 105m−1 s−1). Catalytic activity in vivo was established by individual overexpression of the human (h) DIPP3 isoforms in HEK293 cells, which reduced cellular levels of diphosphoinositol polyphosphates by 40–50%. The hDIPP3 mRNA is preferentially expressed in testis, accompanied by relatively weak expression in the brain, contrasting with hDIPP1 and hDIPP2 which are widely expressed. ThehDIPP3 genes (NUDT10 encodes hDIPP3α;NUDT11 encodes hDIPP3β) are only 152 kbp apart at p11.22 on chromosome X and probably arose by duplication.

Almost all of the substrates for these hydrolases are nucleotide diphosphates. The unique exception is provided by a subgroup of phosphohydrolases (DIPPs)2 that preferentially attack diphosphoinositol polyphosphates (4Caffrey J.J. Safrany S.T. Yang X. Shears S.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 12730-12736Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 5Safrany S.T. Caffrey J.J. Yang X. Bembenek M.E. Moyer M.B. Burkhart W.A. Shears S.B.

The diphosphoinositol polyphosphates provide the most extreme example of the degree to which phosphate groups can be clustered in high density around the inositol ring. These compounds are formed when specific monoester phosphate groups on Ins(1,3,4,5,6)P5 and InsP6 are converted to diphosphates, by enzymes known as diphosphoinositol polyphosphate synthases (DINS). For example, InsP6 is phosphorylated to PP-InsP5 and [PP]2-InsP4, which contain either one or two diphosphate groups, respectively (6Menniti F.S. Miller R.N. Putney J.W., Jr. Shears S.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 3850-3856Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 7Stephens L.R. Radenberg T. Thiel U. Vogel G. Khoo K.-H. Dell A. Jackson T.R. Hawkins P.T. Mayr G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4009-4015Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The DIPPs rapidly degrade the diphosphates back to their monoester precursors. This phosphate release relieves some of the severity of the electrostatic and steric constraints imposed upon these polyphosphorylated molecules, and so a substantial and physiologically purposeful free-energy change ensues. Indeed, evidence has accumulated that this DINS- and DIPP-catalyzed substrate cycling contributes to the control of vesicle trafficking. Initially, this hypothesis arose from observations we made several years ago (8Ali N. Duden R. Bembenek M.E. Shears S.B. Biochem. J. 1995; 310: 279-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 9Fleischer B. Xie J. Mayrleitner M. Shears S.B. Palmer D.J. Fleischer S. J. Biol.

More recently, disruption of theKCS1 gene in yeast, which encodes DINS activity (11Saiardi A. Erdjument-Bromage H. Snowman A. Tempst P. Snyder S.H. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 1323-1326Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar), was shown to impede vacuolar morphogenesis in a manner that likely represents a vesicle trafficking defect (12Saiardi A.

Several additional functions have been ascribed to diphosphoinositol polyphosphates. For example, in yeast, the turnover of diphosphoinositol polyphosphates plays roles in homologous recombination (14Saiardi A. Nagata E. Luo H.R. Snowman A.M. Snyder S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 39179-39185Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar), the maintenance of cell wall integrity (13Dubois E. Scherens B. Vierendeels F., Ho, M.W.Y.

The g5R gene in the African swine fever virus was recently found to encode an active diphosphoinositol polyphosphate phosphohydrolase, suggesting a role for these compounds in viral morphogenesis (15Cartwright J.L. Safrany S.T. Dixon L.K. Darzynkiewicz E. Stepinski J. Burke R. McLennan A.G. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 1415-1421Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Finally, genetic manipulation of the turnover of diphosphoinositol polyphosphates in ovarian carcinoma cells affects apoptotic processes (16Morrison B.H. Bauer J.A. Kalvakolanu D.V. Lindner D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 24965-24970Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). To rationalize how such diverse biological processes can all be regulated by diphosphoinositol polyphosphates, it has been proposed that these compounds are ligands that modify the functions of certain proteins (11Saiardi A. Erdjument-Bromage H. Snowman A. Tempst P. Snyder S.H. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 1323-1326Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar, 17Voglmaier S.M. Bembenek M.E. Kaplin A.I.

In such an event, polyphosphate turnover can be envisaged to comprise a molecular switch (11Saiardi A. Erdjument-Bromage H. Snowman A. Tempst P. Snyder S.H. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 1323-1326Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar, 17Voglmaier S.M. Bembenek M.E. Kaplin A.I. Dormán G. Olszewski J.D. Prestwich G.D. Snyder S.H. Proc. Natl.

Signal. 2001; 13: 151-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar), akin to G-proteins that function as a binary switch between two interconvertible GTP-bound active and GDP-bound inactive states. The rate of turnover of diphosphoinositol polyphosphates may be regulated in a combinatorial manner by cell- and developmental-specific expression of the various isoforms of DIPP and DINS. For example, three distinct DINS enzymes are known to phosphorylate InsP6 to PP-InsP5, and these proteins differ in both catalytic activity and subcellular localization (11Saiardi A.

These three DIPP isoforms each have differing catalytic efficiencies, and their expression is apparently regulated by a variety of molecular processes (4Caffrey J.J. Safrany S.T. Yang X. Shears S.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 12730-12736Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). For example, the two type 2 proteins are transcribed from a single gene by a specialized form of alternate mRNA splicing known as intron boundary skidding (19Caffrey J.J. Shears S.B. Gene (Amst.). 2001; 269: 53-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Moreover, both hDIPP2α and hDIPP2β are translated from an array of mRNA transcripts of differing lengths which may have distinct turnover rates (4Caffrey J.J. Safrany S.T. Yang X. Shears S.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 12730-12736Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). We now add to the range of enzymes regulating diphosphoinositol polyphosphate turnover with the molecular and biochemical characterization of a new pair of hDIPP isoforms, type 3α and type 3β. All DNA probes used in this study were generated with a PCR DIG Probe Synthesis kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) using the indicated PCR primers and were labeled with digoxigenin-dUTP. Cycling conditions are as follows: 94 °C/5 min, followed by 30 cycles of 94 °C/30 s, 55 °C/30 s, 72 °C/2 min; 72 °C/7 min. Reactions were subsequently held at 4 °C until analysis. Probe P1 was generated using primers (5′-GAAGTTCAAGCCCAACC-3′ (sense) and 5′-CAAGGCATTATTATCCGG-3′ (antisense)) that amplify the DNA sequence encoding amino acids 3–165 of the hDIPP2α protein (4Caffrey J.J. Safrany S.T. Yang X. Shears S.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 12730-12736Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Four master membranes containing the arrayed Human Universal cDNA Library (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) were probed overnight as described below. The blots were washed twice for 15 min each with 0.5× SSC, 0.1% SDS at 50 °C, and hybridizing signals were detected by chemiluminescence. On these blots, each primary signal represents a pool of 96 cDNA clones; secondary blots consisting of each of these 96 cDNAs individually arrayed were probed as described below, and positive clones were then purchased from Stratagene as pure DNA stocks. PCR cycle sequencing of both strands of each cDNA clone was performed with AmpliTaq DNA Polymerase FS and dRhodamine chemistry (Applied Biosystems Inc., Foster City, CA) using universal and clone-specific primers. All clones analyzed, except one, encoded hDIPP2 open reading frames. The exception, a 2020-bp cDNA, contained an open reading frame that we designate as hDIPP3α. The cDNA clones are in the cloning vector pT7T3-18U, and each clone contains a 5′ poly(C) and a 3′ poly(A) tract, on the sense strand, as a result of the cloning strategy used to generate the library. The 5′ end of the hDIPP3α clone is reported, therefore, as the first non-C nucleotide sequenced. A single nucleotide mutation of hDIPP3α was performed with the QuickChange Site-directed Mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) with mutation oligonucleotides: 5′-CAGAACCAGGACCGCAAGCACAGAACGTACG-3′ (sense) and 5′-CGTTCTGTGCTTGCGGTCCTGGTTCTGTTCG-3′ (antisense). This results in a cDNA that codes for hDIPP3β, in which Arg-89 replaces Pro-89 in hDIPP3α. The coding region of hDIPP3α cDNA, subcloned into pBluescript II SK−, was used as a template for this reaction. The sequence of the mutated cDNA was confirmed using T3 and T7 primers, with the Big-Dye terminator cycle sequencing kit (Applied Biosystems, Inc.) and a Prism 377 genetic analyzer (Applied Biosystems, Inc).

Total RNA was isolated and reverse-transcribed (20Brown C.J. Carrel L. Willard H.F. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1997; 60: 1333-1343Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), and X-linked gene expression was examined using cDNA corresponding to either 250 ng of total RNA for a positive control transcript (SHGC-32313) that escapes inactivation (21Carrel L. Cottle A.A. Goglin K.C. Willard H.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 14440-14444Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar) or 250 ng for hDIPP3α or 50 ng for hDIPP3β. The hDIPP3α transcript was amplified using as primers 5′-CAAAGCCAGGCACAGTGTTA-3′ (sense) and 5′-GGGGCATGGTCAAATTTAGG-3′ (antisense) for 40 cycles at an annealing temperature of 58 °C. The hDIPP3β transcript was amplified using as primers 5′-TTGCCTCTCTCACTGATCCA-3′ (sense) and 5′-GCAGCCTCTTTCCTAAATGC-3′ (antisense) for 30 cycles with a 55 °C annealing temperature. Northern, dot, and arrayed library blots were pre-hybridized in DIG Easy Hyb solution (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) for 30 min, hybridized at 37 (DNA blots) or 50 °C (RNA blots) overnight with 50–100 ng of labeled probe/ml DIG Easy Hyb, and washed twice for 15 min each to the indicated stringency (see below). Hybridizing signals were labeled with an alkaline phosphatase-conjugated anti-digoxigenin antibody (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) for 30 min at room temperature and detected by chemiluminescence using CDP-STAR (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Human multiple tissue expression array dot blots (CLONTECH) were hybridized with a probe (P4) that was generated with the following primers: 5′-GCGAGGACGAGGTCCTGT-3′ (sense) and 5′-GCTCATCTGTGCTTCACA (antisense). Probe P4 is specific for the hDIPP3α coding region plus ∼100 bp of the 3′-untranslated region. The blot was hybridized as described above, washed twice for 15 min each to a stringency of 0.5× SSC, 0.1% SDS at 50 °C, and processed for chemiluminescent detection of signal as described above. Northern analysis was also performed in an identical manner with a Human Multiple Tissue Northern blot (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA), using a hDIPP3α coding region probe (P2), generated using the following primers: 5′-GCGAGGACGAGGTCCTGT-3′ (sense) and 5′-GGGGCCATGGAGTTTCCA-3′ (antisense). This blot was washed twice for 15 min each to a stringency of 0.1× SSC, 0.1% SDS at 50 °C, and then chemiluminescent detection was performed as described above. The blot was subsequently stripped with boiling 1% SDS and re-probed with a human β-actin probe (P3) under the same hybridization and wash conditions. P3 was generated from a cDNA of human β-actin (CLONTECH) using the following primers 5-ATCGCCGCGCTCGTCGTCG-3′ (sense) and 5′-CACCGGAGTCCATCACG-3′ (antisense). Recombinant hDIPP1 and hDIPP2 proteins were prepared as described previously (4Caffrey J.J. Safrany S.T. Yang X. Shears S.B. J. Biol.

EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6599-6607Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). The entire coding regions of hDIPP3α and hDIPP3β, prepared as described above, were amplified by PCR using 5′-GATCGTCGACATGAAGTGCAAACCCAACCAG-3′ (sense) and 5′-GATCGAGCTCCGGGATCGCTATCTGGCGAGG-3′ (antisense) primers containingSalI and SacI restriction sites, respectively. The resultant PCR product was digested with these enzymes, agarose gel-purified, and ligated into the cognate sites of vector pIVEX-2.3MCS (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), and the construct was completely sequenced to verify its structure. The recombinant, poly(His)-tagged hDIPP3α and hDIPP3β proteins were synthesized in a 1-ml volume of the Rapid Translation System RTS 500 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), according to the manufacturer’s protocol. The extract was subsequently bound, at 4 °C for 3 h, to 1.5 ml of TALON metal affinity resin (CLONTECH) in 5 ml of Buffer A (50 mmphosphate buffer (pH 7.0), 300 mm NaCl, 2 mmDTT, and a protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Molecular Biochemicals product number 1-697-498)). The resin was washed three times with 15 ml of Buffer A, and bound hDIPP3 protein was then eluted with 1-ml aliquots of Buffer A plus 150 mm imidazole, by gravity flow. Most of the protein eluted in the second 1-ml fraction, which was dialyzed twice against 500 ml of Buffer A, and then the final enzyme preparations were stored at −70 °C. The peptide NGNSMAPSSPDSDP, representing the C-terminal 14 amino acid residues of hDIPP3, was synthesized with an N-terminal C residue and conjugated to keyhole limpet hemocyanin protein (SigmaGenosys, The Woodlands, TX). This conjugated peptide was used to raise antisera in New Zealand White rabbits (SigmaGenosys) following standard protocols. The anti-hDIPP2 anti-peptide antibodies were prepared as described previously (4Caffrey J.J. Safrany S.T. Yang X. Shears S.B. J. Biol.

All serum samples were stored in aliquots at −80 °C. Recombinant hDIPP1 and hDIPP2α were prepared as described previously (4Caffrey J.J. Safrany S.T. Yang X. Shears S.B. J. Biol.

Human Hs1.Tes and Hs181.Tes cell lines (ATCC) were lysed by vortexing in extraction buffer containing 50 mm β-glycerophosphate (pH 8.2), 250 mm sucrose, 100 mm NaCl, 50 mm NaF, 1 mm EDTA, 10 μm EGTA, 1 mm DTT, 4 mm CHAPS, 250 μm4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluoride, 10 mmtrans-epoxysuccinyl-l-leucylamido(4-guanidino)-butane, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin. Samples were subsequently centrifuged at 18,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C, and the supernatants were stored at −70 °C. Mouse testes were frozen in liquid nitrogen, pulverized in a TissueMizer for 10 s, and extracted in the above buffer. Next, 200-μg aliquots of protein were separated on 4–12% polyacrylamide NuPAGE Bis-Tris gels (Invitrogen) and transferred to nitrocellulose filters, and then the filters were rinsed in Tris-buffered saline/Tween 20 (0.1%, v/v). Filters were then treated with blocking buffer (5% (w/v) nonfat dry milk in Tris-buffered saline/Tween) for 1 h at room temperature and then incubated with anti-peptide antiserum in more blocking buffer. Blots were washed with Tris-buffered saline/Tween and incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (AmershamBiosciences) for 30 min. Unbound secondary antibody was washed off with Tris-buffered saline/Tween, and antibody-antigen complexes were detected by chemiluminescence using SuperSignal reagent (Pierce). PP-[3H]InsP5 (specific activity ∼20 Ci/mmol) was prepared as described previously (22Safrany S.T. Ingram S.W. Cartwright J.L. Falck J.R. McLennan A.G. Barnes L.D. Shears S.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21735-21740Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Non-radiolabeled PP-InsP5 (with the diphosphate group added to the 5-carbon) was prepared as described previously (23Albert C. Safrany S.T. Bembenek M.E. Reddy K.M. Reddy K.K. Falck J.R. Bro¨ker M. Shears S.B. Mayr G.W. Biochem. J. 1997; 327: 553-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). [PP]2-[3H]InsP4 was prepared as follows. Three rat brains were homogenized in 2 volumes of buffer containing 20 mm HEPES (pH 6.8), 2 mm CHAPS, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm DTT plus a protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). A 100,000 × g supernatant was prepared, 100-μl aliquots of which were each incubated for 90 min at 37 °C with 0.5 μCi of [3H]InsP6 (specific activity ∼20 Ci/mmol; PerkinElmer Life Sciences) in 500 μl buffer containing 0.75 mm EGTA, 1.5 mm EDTA, 9 mmMgSO4, 7.5 mm ATP, 10 mm NaF, 20 mm phosphocreatine, 1 mm DTT, 20 mmHEPES (pH 6.8), 4 mm CHAPS, 20 Sigma units/ml creatine phosphokinase, and 4 μg of human DINS type 1. The reaction mixture was preincubated for 60 min at 37 °C prior to the addition of the rat brain supernatant to ensure phosphorylation of [3H]InsP6 to PP-[3H]InsP5. The resultant [PP]2-[3H]InsP4 was purified by HPLC and desalted (22Safrany S.T. Ingram S.W. Cartwright J.L. Falck J.R. McLennan A.G. Barnes L.D. Shears S.B. J. Biol.

Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 3649-3655Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). [3H]Ap6A was custom-labeled with tritium by catalytic exchange by Moravek Biochemicals (Brea, CA). [3H]Ap6A had a radiochemical purity of 94% and was stored as a 50% ethanol solution at −20 °C. [3H]dGTP was purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. To study hydrolysis of diphosphoinositol polyphosphates, purified recombinant hDIPP protein was incubated at 37 °C in 100–450 μl of buffer containing 50 mm KCl, 25 mm HEPES (pH 7.2 with KOH), 2 mm DTT, 2 mm MgSO4, 1 mm EDTA, 0.05 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, plus ∼1000 dpm of [PP]2-[3H]InsP4 or 2000 dpm of PP-[3H]InsP5. In order to determineKm and kcat values for PP-InsP5 hydrolysis, non-radioactive substrate was added to a final concentration across the range 10–1500 nm. For [PP]2-InsP4 hydrolysis, the specificity constant (kcat/Km) was determined from the first-order rate constant, with the assumption that substrate concentration (∼0.2 nm) was below 5% of itsKm value (25Crompton I.E. Waley S.G. Biochem. J. 1986; 239: 221-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Assays were quenched by placing the tubes on ice, followed immediately by the addition of 0.25 volume of ice-cold 250 mm EDTA (pH 7.0). Subsequently, protein was precipitated by the addition of 0.2 volume ice-cold 2 mperchloric acid (+0.1 mg/ml InsP6). After 15 min, samples were centrifuged, and the perchloric acid was precipitated by addition of 0.35 volume of 1 m K2CO3 + 5 mm EDTA. Samples were again centrifuged, and then the resultant supernatants were analyzed by HPLC on a Partisphere SAX column as described previously (12Saiardi A. Caffrey J.J. Snyder S.H. Shears S.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24686-24692Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Recombinant hDIPP protein was also separately incubated with [3H]Ap6A in 50 mm HEPES-NaOH (pH 7.6), 1 mm MnCl2, 2 mm DTT, and 100 μg of bovine serum albumin/ml in a final volume of 100 μl for 30 min at 37 °C. The reaction was stopped and the products separated from residual substrate by boronate chromatography as described previously (26Barnes L.D. Robinson A.K. Mumford C.H. Garrison P.N. Anal. Biochem. 1985; 144: 296-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), and the products were detected by liquid scintillation counting. HEK293 cells were cultured at 37 °C in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium, 10% fetal bovine serum with 5% CO2, and cells were radiolabeled with 25 μCi/ml [3H]inositol (ARC, St. Louis, MO) for 5 days. On the 3rd day, cells (in a 6-well plate) were transfected with 5 μg of plasmid DNA encoding either GFP, GFP-hDIPP3α, or GFP-hDIPP3β, using LipofectAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen), according to the manufacturer’s recommended protocol. The cDNA for the GFP-DIPP fusion constructs was prepared by subcloning the coding region of hDIPP3α and hDIPP3β into the phGFP105C1 vector (27Yamasaki M. Hashiguchi N. Tsukamoto T. Osumi T. Bioimages. 1998; 6: 1-7Google Scholar). Approximately 80% of the cells was estimated to express GFP. Cells were quenched with 1 ml of 0.6m perchloric acid supplemented with 0.1 mg/ml InsP6. Lysates were neutralized (28Saiardi A. Caffrey J.J. Snyder S.H. Shears S.B. FEBS Lett. 2000; 468: 28-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar) and analyzed by HPLC on a Partisphere SAX column (Krackler Scientific, NC) eluted with a gradient generated by mixing Buffer A (1 mmNa2EDTA) and Buffer B (1 mm Na2EDTA + 1.3 m (NH4)2HPO4 (pH 3.85), with H3PO4) as follows: 0–10 min, 0% B; 10–30 min, 0–45% B; 30–90 min, 45–100% B; 90–105 min, 100% B. One-ml fractions were collected, and the radiolabeled inositol phosphates were determined by liquid scintillation counting. Aliquots of non-radiolabeled HEK293 cells were also transfected with plasmid DNA encoding either GFP or the GFP-hDIPP3 fusion constructs as described above. Cells were lysed with 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA and 1% Triton X-100, followed by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 20 min. Aliquots of the supernatant were analyzed by SDS-PAGE on 10% Bis-Tris NuPage gels with MES buffer; GFP-fusion proteins were detected by anti-GFP antibody (Invitrogen) or by anti-hDIPP3 antisera. The sequence alignments described in this study were obtained with Peptool version 2 and Genetool version 1 (Biotools Inc., Alberta, Canada). We have previously cloned hDIPP1 and hDIPP2 cDNAs (4Caffrey J.J. Safrany S.T. Yang X. Shears S.B. J. Biol.

In the current study we first searched for novel hDIPP isoforms by screening an arrayed human cDNA library with a 492-bp probe spanning the coding region of hDIPP2α (P1, see under “Experimental Procedures”). A novel 2020-bp cDNA was identified that encodes a 164-amino acid residue protein (Fig.1A). In the alignments shown in Fig. 1A, the sequence of this new protein is 90% identical to residues 2–165 in hDIPP2 and 74% identical to residues 2–164 in hDIPP1. We therefore propose that our new protein represents a novel DIPP isoform, which we have named type 3α (Fig. 1). This hDIPP3α protein has particularly strong conservation of a 33-residue active site found in hDIPP1 and hDIPP2 (Fig. 1A),i.e. the Nudix core domain (3Bessman M.J. Frick D.N. O'Handley S.F. J. Biol.

https://openalex.org/W2009106472,"Cl(-) channel activities vary during the cell cycle and are thought to play various roles including regulation of cell volume. We have shown previously that ClC-2 channels are directly phosphorylated and functionally regulated by the M phase-specific cyclin-dependent kinase p34(cdc2)/cyclin B. We investigate here to determine whether the expression levels of ClC-2 channel protein vary during the cell cycle. Immunoblot and immunocytochemical analyses of cells cycle-synchronized by serum depletion/replenishment reveal that ClC-2 channel protein is expressed predominantly at M phase in cells with two nuclei and a clear constriction ring, whereas RNA blot analysis shows that ClC-2 mRNA expression does not change during the cell cycle. Ubiquitin assays reveal that the ClC-2 channels are ubiquitinated at M phase, whereas the magnitude of ubiquitination is suppressed by incubation with olomoucine, an inhibitor of p34(cdc2)/cyclin B, and it is almost completely abolished in ClC-2 channels having an S632A mutation, which cannot be phosphorylated by p34(cdc2)/cyclin B, indicating that ubiquitination of ClC-2 channels requires phosphorylation by M phase-specific p34(cdc2)/cyclin B. Regulation at the post-transcriptional level, including phosphorylation-dependent ubiquitination, may contribute to M phase-specific expression of ClC-2 channels. Cell cycle-dependent regulation of expression at the protein level in addition to the regulation of function suggests that the ClC-2 channel plays a physiological role in the cell cycle."

Here we investigate the nature of membrane binding of the Arabidopsis dynamin-like 6 (ADL6) involved in vesicle trafficking from the trans-Golgi network to the central vacuole. Fractionation experiments by continuous sucrose gradients and gel filtration revealed that the majority of ADL6 is associated with membranes in vivo. Amino acid sequence analysis revealed that ADL6 has a putative pleckstrin homology (PH) domain. In vitro lipid binding assays demonstrated that ADL6 showed high affinity binding to phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate (PtdIns-3-P) and that the PH domain was responsible for this interaction. However, the PH domain alone binds equally well to both PtdIns-3-P and phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate (PtdIns-4-P). Interestingly, the high affinity binding of the PH domain to PtdIns-3-P was restored by a protein-protein interaction between the PH domain and the C-terminal region. In addition, deletion of the inserted regions within the PH domain results in high affinity binding of the PH domain to PtdIns-3-P. These results suggest that ADL6 binds specifically to PtdIns-3-P and that the lipid binding specificity is determined by the interaction between the PH domain and the C-terminal domain of ADL6.

From these numerous studies, dynamin I has been shown to function as a mechanochemical enzyme that pinches off the neck of invaginated membranes, thereby releasing the budding membrane as a vesicle (10Hinshaw J.E.

Unlike the dynamin I protein, which is involved in endocytosis in animal cells, other members of the dynamin family have been proposed to play roles in other biological processes, such as maintenance of mitochondrial morphology (14Mozdy A.D.

EMBO J. 1998; 17: 859-867Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), and vacuolar trafficking of proteins at the trans-Golgi network (TGN)1 (18Jin J.B. Kim Y.A Kim S.J. Lee S.H. Kim D.H. Cheong G.W. Hwang I. Plant Cell. 2001; 13: 1511-1526Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). Although the exact mechanism of action of these proteins remains to be elucidated, they appear to be involved in various biological processes, including the modulation of membrane structures such as membrane fission (19Yoon Y. Pitts K.R. McNiven M.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 2894-2905Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). To modulate membrane structure, these proteins must be able to bind to membranes. The membrane association of dynamin I has been shown to be mediated by the PH domain of the protein that binds specifically to phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PtdIns-4,5-P2) (20Salim K. Bottomley M.J Querfurth E. Zvelebil M.J. Gout I. Scaife R. Margolis R.L. Gigg R. Smith C.I. Driscoll P.C. Waterfield M.D. Panayotou G.

Also, other members of the dynamin family, such asArabidopsis dynamin-like 1 (ADL1), ADL2, and phragmoplastin also have been shown to bind to membranes in vivo (22Park J.M. Kang S.G. Pih K.T.

Plant Physiol. 2001; 127: 1243-1255Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Among these, ADL2 has been shown to bind specifically to PtdIns-4-Pin vitro (24Kim Y.W. Park D.S. Park S.C. Kim S.H. Cheong G.W. Hwang I. Plant Physiol. 2001; 127: 1243-1255Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). However, except for dynamin I, the nature of membrane association of dynamin-related proteins is unclear because the PH domain is apparently absent from certain members of the dynamin family, such as Vsp1p and ADL2 (2Rothman J.H.

Another important biochemical characteristic of these proteins for their role in membrane modulation is high molecular weight complex formation (10Hinshaw J.E. Schmid S.L.

Previously, we have shown that ADL6 is localized to the TGN and involved in trafficking of cargo proteins from the TGN to the central vacuole in Arabidopsis (18Jin J.B. Kim Y.A Kim S.J. Lee S.H. Kim D.H. Cheong G.W. Hwang I. Plant Cell. 2001; 13: 1511-1526Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). To further understand the role of ADL6 in vivo, we characterized the nature of its interaction with membranes. In this study, we present evidence that ADL6 binds to phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate with high affinity and that the lipid binding specificity of the PH domain is determined through an intermolecular interaction between the PH domain and the C-terminal domain (CTD). Arabidopsis thaliana (ecotype Columbia) was grown in a greenhouse under a 16/8 h light/dark cycle at a temperature of 20 °C and relative humidity of 70%. Also, plants were grown on Murashige and Skoog plates in a growth chamber at 20 °C with a 16/8 h light/dark cycle. The PH domain of ADL6 (amino acid residues 558–759) was amplified by the polymerase chain reaction using two specific primers (GAGACGCCGGAGGTCTCTGG and GGATCCGAACAACAGCCTTTGG). To generate the 1877 mutant containing the PH domain and the C-terminal domain (amino acid residues 558–914), a DNA fragment was amplified by two specific primers (GAGACGCCGGAGGTCTCTGG and ATACCTGTAAGCTGAACC). The CTD of ADL6 (amino acid residues 760–914) was PCR-amplified using two specific primers, TGTCAAGTAGAGAAAGCAAA and ATACCTGTAAGCTGAACC. To generate PHD(ΔI1), N- and C-terminal regions of the PH domain were amplified using two sets of primers: GAGACGCCGGAGGTCTCTGG and AATAGTGCATTCCTCC and AAGGACCAGGCCTTGT and GGATCCGAACAACAGCCTTTGG, respectively, and the resulting fragments were ligated. Similarly, the N- and C-terminal regions of PHD(ΔI2) were amplified using two sets of primers: GAGACGCCGGAGGTCTCTGG and AAGGGCATTGTGAGCTT and AACGAGTGGATTAATA and GGATCCGAACAACAGCCTTTGG, respectively. The N- and C-terminal regions of PHD(ΔI3) were PCR-amplified using two sets of primers: GAGACGCCGGAGGTCTCTGG and tccacgagcctggat and GGATCCGAACAACAGCCTTTGG and CCAGAAGAGGAGCTC, respectively. The N- and C-terminal fragments for PHD(ΔI1), PHD(ΔI2) and PHD(ΔI3) were then ligated. DNA fragments encoding all the deletion mutants and the full-length ADL6 were ligated in-frame with the maltose-binding protein (MBP) at the XbaI and EcoRI sites of pMAL-c2 (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA). Also, DNA encoding these deletion mutants was ligated to pGEX-5X-1 (Amersham Biosciences) to generate glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion proteins. To express MBP or GST fusion proteins, the expression constructs were introduced into JM109. Expression of recombinant proteins was induced with 0.3 mmisopropyl-d-thiogalactopyranoside for 4 h at 28 °C or for 1 h at 37 °C. The cultures were harvested by centrifugation at 5,000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C. The pellets were resuspended in ice-cold resuspension buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 200 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) containing protease inhibitors (1 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml antipain) and sonicated with 30-s bursts at a maximal setting at 4 °C. Cell debris was then removed by centrifugation at 18,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. For purification of recombinant proteins, cleared supernatant was incubated with 1/100 volume of pre-equilibrated glutathione-Sepharose beads (for GST fusions) or amylose resin (for MBP fusions) on an orbital shaker for 30 min at 4 °C. The beads were collected by centrifugation at 1,000 × g for 1 min and washed three times with ice-cold suspension buffer. The fusion proteins were eluted by adding 5 mm glutathione, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0 (for GST fusions), or 10 mm maltose, 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.0 (for MBP fusions). Various lipids, such as phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), phosphatidylcholine (PC), PtdIns, PtdIns-4-P, phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PtdIns-4,5-P2), PtdIns-3-P, phosphatidylinositol 3,4-bisphosphate (PtdIns-3,4-P2), and phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate (PtdIns-3,4,5-P3), were used for lipid binding analysis. The lipid binding assays were done by Fat Western blot analysis (24Kim Y.W. Park D.S. Park S.C. Kim S.H. Cheong G.W. Hwang I. Plant Physiol. 2001; 127: 1243-1255Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 28Stevenson J.M. Perera I.Y. Boss W.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22761-22767Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar) using affinity-purified recombinant proteins. Briefly, 10-μl volumes of various concentrations of lipids dissolved in chloroform were applied to nitrocellulose membranes. The membranes were blocked with 10 ml of buffer containing 20 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, 140 mm NaCl, and 0.1% Tween 20 (TTBS) overnight at 4 °C and then incubated with 0.5 μg/ml purified recombinant protein in 10 ml of TTBS containing 3% fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin for 1 h at room temperature. After washing three times with TTBS, the blot was incubated with the primary antibody for 1 h at room temperature and washed three times for 20 min each time. A secondary antibody was then incubated and washed under the same conditions as the primary antibody. The ECL detection system was used for visualization (Amersham Biosciences). Purified proteins were dialyzed against HP buffer (10 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mmEGTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) containing 100 mm NaCl and then centrifuged at 18,000 × gfor 15 min to remove aggregated proteins. Liposomes were prepared by mixing phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylinositol, PtdIns-3-P, and PtdIns-4-P at the ratio indicated in each experiment, drying the mixture under nitrogen, and resuspending to a final concentration of 2 mg of total phospholipid/ml buffer containing 50 mm Hepes-NaOH (pH 7.4), 100 mm NaCl, and 0.5 mm EDTA (29Patki V. Virbasius J. Lane W.S. Toh B.H. Shpetner H.S. Corvera S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 7326-7330Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). The resuspended lipids were sonicated until a homogenous suspension was formed. Liposomes were collected by centrifugation at 16,000 ×g for 10 min. Liposome (50 μl) was mixed with proteins (5 μg in 50 μl in the same buffer) and incubated for 15 min at room temperature. Proteins bound to the liposomes were sedimented by centrifugation at 16,000 × g for 30 min. Proteins present in the pellet and supernatant were fractionated by SDS-PAGE and the presence of MBP fusion proteins was detected by Western blot analysis using anti-MBP antibody. For GST pull-down assays, cleared supernatant containing 10 μg of recombinant GST fusion proteins and cleared supernatant containing 20 μg of MBP fusion proteins were mixed in 10 ml of protein pull-down buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.2% Triton X-100, 0.1% Nonidet P-40) and incubated with agitation at 4 °C for 1 h with glutathione-Sepharose beads. The beads were then pelleted by centrifugation at 2,000 × g for 1 min at 4 °C and washed four times with protein pull-down buffer. The bound proteins were eluted, fractionated by 10% SDS-PAGE, and subjected to Western blot analysis using an anti-MBP antibody. ADL6 is a homolog of the mechanochemical protein dynamin and has been shown to be involved in intracellular trafficking of cargo proteins from the trans-Golgi network to the central vacuole (18Jin J.B. Kim Y.A Kim S.J. Lee S.H. Kim D.H. Cheong G.W. Hwang I. Plant Cell. 2001; 13: 1511-1526Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). As in the case of other members of the dynamin family (20Salim K. Bottomley M.J Querfurth E. Zvelebil M.J. Gout I. Scaife R. Margolis R.L. Gigg R. Smith C.I. Driscoll P.C. Waterfield M.D. Panayotou G.

Plant Physiol. 2001; 127: 1243-1255Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), it is likely that ADL6 is associated with membranes. To enhance our understanding of the molecular mechanism by which ADL6 plays a rolein vivo, we investigated the nature of membrane association of ADL6. First we investigated the subcellular distribution of ADL6in vivo by ultracentrifugation through a sucrose gradient. As shown in Fig. 1, the majority of ADL6 was found in the region of 37–41% sucrose, indicating that ADL6 may be associated with membranes, as in the case of dynamin and its related proteins (20Salim K. Bottomley M.J Querfurth E. Zvelebil M.J. Gout I. Scaife R. Margolis R.L. Gigg R. Smith C.I. Driscoll P.C. Waterfield M.D. Panayotou G. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6241-6250Crossref PubMed Scopus (495) Google Scholar, 22Park J.M. Kang S.G. Pih K.T. Jang H.J. Piao H.L. Yoon H.W. Cho M.J. Hwang I.

Plant Physiol. 2001; 127: 1243-1255Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). To further confirm that ADL6 is associated with membranes, total protein extracts were treated with Triton X-100 and then fractionated in a continuous sucrose gradient by ultracentrifugation. The presence of ADL6 in these fractions was examined by Western blot analysis. As shown in Fig. 1A, ADL6 was detected in the region of 30–37% sucrose in the gradient after treatment with Triton X-100, compared with 37–41% sucrose in the gradient without Triton X-100 treatment. Interestingly, the behavior of ADL6 in the sucrose gradient was rather unusual. When protein extracts treated with Triton X-100, an agent that can solubilize membranes, are fractionated in a sucrose gradient by ultracentrifugation, membrane proteins are found at the top fractions (the soluble fractions) in the sucrose gradient. However, in contrast to this notion, ADL6 was detected in the region of 30–37% sucrose of the gradient after Triton X-100 treatment but not at the top of the gradient. The behavior of ADL6 was quite similar to ADL1 and ADL2 found in plant cells (22Park J.M. Kang S.G. Pih K.T. Jang H.J. Piao H.L. Yoon H.W. Cho M.J. Hwang I. Plant Physiol. 1997; 115: 763-771Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 24Kim Y.W. Park D.S. Park S.C. Kim S.H. Cheong G.W. Hwang I.

Chem. 1996; 271: 22310-22314Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). The fact that ADL6 migrated at the low percentage of sucrose in the gradient strongly suggests that Triton X-100 may have removed membranes associated with ADL6. At the same time, the fact that it did not migrate at the top of the gradient (soluble fraction) after Triton X-100 treatment suggests that ADL6 may be present as a high molecular weight complex as in the case of dynamin and ADL isoforms (22Park J.M. Kang S.G. Pih K.T. Jang H.J. Piao H.L. Yoon H.W. Cho M.J. Hwang I. Plant Physiol. 1997; 115: 763-771Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 24Kim Y.W. Park D.S. Park S.C. Kim S.H. Cheong G.W.

Chem. 1996; 271: 22310-22314Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). Previously, it was shown that ADL1 and other dynamin-related proteins are found as high molecular weight complexes (22Park J.M. Kang S.G. Pih K.T. Jang H.J. Piao H.L. Yoon H.W. Cho M.J. Hwang I. Plant Physiol. 1997; 115: 763-771Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 24Kim Y.W. Park D.S. Park S.C. Kim S.H. Cheong G.W. Hwang I.

Chem. 1996; 271: 22310-22314Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). Thus, ADL6 may also be present as a high molecular weight complex. To examine this possibility, we performed a gel filtration assay using protein extracts obtained from leaf tissues. As shown in Fig. 1B, ADL6 was found in two positions. The first peak was eluted much earlier than the rubisco complex (560 kDa), whereas the other eluted at a position corresponding to an ADL6 dimer (200 kDa). When protein extracts were treated with Triton X-100, the first peak of ADL6 was eluted in later fractions, whereas the second peak was at the same dimer position, indicating that Triton X-100 treatment may have removed membranes associated with ADL6 present in the first peak. These results strongly support the notion that ADL6 may be a high molecular weight complex in vivo, as in the case of dynamin, ADL1, and ADL2 (22Park J.M. Kang S.G. Pih K.T. Jang H.J. Piao H.L.

In the case of dynamin, the PH domain shows high affinity binding to phosphatidylinositol phosphates such as phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate PtdIns-4,5-P2 (20Salim K. Bottomley M.J Querfurth E. Zvelebil M.J. Gout I. Scaife R. Margolis R.L. Gigg R. Smith C.I. Driscoll P.C. Waterfield M.D. Panayotou G. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6241-6250Crossref PubMed Scopus (495) Google Scholar, 21Achiriloaie M. Barylko B. Albanesi J.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1410-1415Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Also, ADL2 has been shown to bind to phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate (PtdIns-4-P) (24Kim Y.W. Park D.S. Park S.C. Kim S.H. Cheong G.W. Hwang I. Plant Physiol. 2001; 127: 1243-1255Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Binding to these phospholipids by the PH domain or similar lipid-binding domains is thought to allow the proteins with these domains to associate with membranes. Thus, to further understand the nature of the membrane association of ADL6, we wanted to investigate whether ADL6 also binds to any of these phospholipids. To address this question, we prepared recombinant ADL6 protein from Escherichia coli as a MBP fusion protein. MBP:ADL6 was affinity-purified using amylose resin beads and used for lipid binding assays (Fig. 2) (24Kim Y.W. Park D.S. Park S.C. Kim S.H. Cheong G.W. Hwang I.

Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 16228-16234Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar), was expressed and purified for use as a positive control for the lipid binding assays. In addition, MBP alone was included as a negative control. Among various phospholipid molecules examined, MBP:ADL6 showed high affinity binding to PtdIns-3-P by Fat Western blot analysis (Fig. 3). As expected, PHD(PLC-δ) showed a high affinity interaction with PtdIns-4,5-P2 when used as a MBP fusion protein (31Garcia P. Gupta R. Shah S. Morris A.J. Rudge S.A. Scarlata S. Petrova V.

These results strongly suggest that ADL6 binds specifically to PtdIns-3-P.FIG. 3ADL6 shows a high affinity binding to PtdIns-3-P. The phospholipid binding assay was carried out using the purified recombinant proteins, MBP·ADL6 (a), MBP (b), and MBP·PHD(PLC-δ) (c), as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Binding of the recombinant proteins to the lipid was detected by Western blot analysis using the polyclonal anti-MBP antibody as the primary antibody.

We first compared the amino acid sequence of ADL6 to other members of the dynamin family. Amino acid sequence analysis using Blastp from the NCBI server suggested that ADL6 has a PH domain (data not shown). In addition, as shown in Fig.4, the region from amino acid residues 558–759 showed a significant degree of amino acid sequence homology to the PH domains of various proteins. Similar to the PH domains of other proteins, this region was predicted to consist of 7 β-sheets followed by an α-helix (20Salim K. Bottomley M.J Querfurth E. Zvelebil M.J. Gout I. Scaife R. Margolis R.L. Gigg R. Smith C.I. Driscoll P.C. Waterfield M.D. Panayotou G. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6241-6250Crossref PubMed Scopus (495) Google Scholar, 32Soisson S.M. Nimnual A.S. Uy M. Bar-Sagi D. Kuriyan J. Cell. 1988; 16: 259-268Google Scholar) using the protein secondary structure prediction program of the ExPASy Molecular Biology Server. However, the PH domain of ADL6 was slightly larger than the PH domain found in dynamin I and phospholipase C-δ. Amino acid sequence alignment of these PH domains revealed that the PH domain of ADL6 has additional amino acids inserted between the β-sheet structures in the PH domain (Fig. 4). With this information, several deletion mutants were generated, as shown in Fig. 5A, and expressed as MBP fusion proteins, as shown in Fig. 2. Using these recombinant proteins, the lipid binding assay was performed. As in the case of the full-length ADL6 protein, fusion proteins with the PH domain bound to PtdIns-3-P (Fig. 5B). However, interestingly, the fusion protein between MBP and the PH domain (MBP:PHD) showed a slightly different binding pattern than the full-length ADL6 protein (Fig. 6, PHD). The wild-type ADL6 and 1877 showed ∼4-fold higher binding affinity to PtdIns-3-P than to PtdIns-4-P (Fig. 5C). In contrast, as shown in Fig. 5, B and C, the PH domain alone showed nearly equal binding affinity to both PtdIns-3-P and PtdIns-4-P. In addition, the binding affinity of MBP:PHD to these lipids was lower than that of the full-length ADL6. Thus, these results suggest two points: 1) the PH domain is responsible for the binding of ADL6 to phospholipids and 2) the lipid binding specificity of the PH domain is different from that of ADL6. This is quite unexpected because in most cases the PH domain alone is responsible for phospholipid binding (20Salim K. Bottomley M.J Querfurth E. Zvelebil M.J. Gout I. Scaife R. Margolis R.L. Gigg R.

Recent efforts have demonstrated the importance of IFNs in the activation ofsignal transducers and activators of transcription (STATs). The role of STAT1 and STAT2 in IFN-dependent JAK-STAT signaling is well established; however, the role of STAT3 and its activation by IFNs remains unclear. Understanding the IFN-dependent regulation of STAT3 is of increasing interest because recent studies have demonstrated that STAT3 may play a role in cancer. Studies have revealed that STAT3 is constitutively active in a number of cancer cell lines and that overexpression of an active form of STAT3 transforms normal fibroblasts. Therefore, STAT3 exhibits properties indicative of known oncogenes. In this report, we define the role of the type I IFN receptor in STAT3 activation and identify for the first time tyrosine residues present in the cytoplasmic domain of IFNAR2c that are critical for STAT3 activation. The regulation of STAT3 activation by IFNs was measured in a human lung fibrosarcoma cell line lacking IFNAR2c but stably expressing various IFNAR2c tyrosine mutants. We show here that in addition to IFN-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT3, activation using a STAT3-dependent electrophoretic mobility shift assay and a STAT3-specific reporter can also be demonstrated. Furthermore, we demonstrate that type I IFN-dependent activation of STAT3 proceeds through a novel mechanism that is dependent on two tyrosines, Tyr337 and Tyr512, present in IFNAR2c and contained within a conserved six-amino acid residue motif, GxGYxM. Surprisingly, both tyrosines were previously shown to be required for type I IFN-dependent STAT1 and STAT2 activation. Our results reveal that type I IFNs activate multiple STATs via the overlapping usage of two tyrosine residues located in the cytoplasmic domain of IFNAR2c.

Their role in growth control has recently been shown to involve, in part, the activation of a number of important proteins that initiate apoptosis. IFN signaling has previously been demonstrated to proceed through the activation of cellular transcription factors such as STATs, which have themselves been implicated in cancer (1Catlett-Falcone R. Dalton W.S. Jove R. Cur. Opin. Oncol. 1999; 11: 490-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). This observation places IFNs on a list of cellular modifiers that are able to control and regulate the processes of cell transformation and cancer cell growth. One well studied cellular pathway of IFN signaling proceeds through the IFN-dependent JAK-STAT pathway, which involves the activation of STAT1 and STAT2 (2Darnell J.E. Kerr I.M. Stark G.R. Science. 1994; 264: 1415-1420Crossref PubMed Scopus (4974) Google Scholar). The role of these two STATs in IFN signaling has been studied extensively; their activation requires the presence of two IFN receptor chains, IFNAR1 and IFNAR2, and the Janus kinases JAK1 and TYK2 (3Uze G. Lutfalla G. Mogensen K. J. Interferon Cytokine Res. 1996; 15: 3-26Crossref Scopus (231) Google Scholar, 4Stark R.G. Kerr I.M. Williams B.R.G. Silverman R.H. Schreiber R. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 67: 227-264Crossref Scopus (3366) Google Scholar). IFN-dependent STAT1 and STAT2 activation has previously been demonstrated to require specific tyrosine residues (Tyr337 and Tyr512) located in the cytoplasmic domain of IFNAR2c (5Russell-Harde D. Wagner T.C. Rani M.R.S. Vogel Colamonici O. Ransohoff R.M. Majchrzak B. Fish E. Perez H.D. Croze E. J. Biol.

In addition, tyrosine residues in IFNAR1 have also been implicated in the activation of STAT1 and STAT2 (7Krishnan K. Singh B. Krolewski J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19495-19501Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 8Yan H. Krishman H. Greenlund A.C. Gupta S. Lim J. Schreiber R.D. Schlinder C.W. Krolewski J.J. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1064-1074Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). However, additional studies in mouse cells have demonstrated that the substitution of all IFNAR1 cytoplasmic tyrosines to phenylalanines results in a receptor still able to respond to IFN stimulation (9Gibbs V.C. Takahashi M. Aguet M. Chuntharapai A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28710-28716Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Recent evidence has demonstrated that in addition to STAT1 and STAT2, STAT3 is also activated in response to IFN stimulation in a number of different cell types (10Yang C-H. Murti A. Pfeffer L.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 5568-5572Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 11Kotenko S.V. Izotova L.S. Mirochnitchenko O.V. Lee C. Pestka S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

This is of particular interest in that the expression of a constitutively active form of STAT3 has been shown to transform normal fibroblasts (13Bromberg J.F. Wrzeszczynska M.H. Devgan G. Zhao Y. Pestell R.G. Albanses C. Darnell J.E. Cell. 1999; 98: 295-303Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2486) Google Scholar). In addition, constitutive expression of STAT3 has been demonstrated to occur in a number of cancer cell lines (14Garcia R. Jove R. J. Biomed. Sci. 1998; 5: 79-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Furthermore, inhibition of STAT3 activation blocks cell transformation by Src in NIH3T3 cells (15Turkson J. Bowman T. Garcia R. Caldenhoven E., De Groot R.P. Love R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2545-2552Crossref PubMed Scopus (591) Google Scholar). Therefore, it has been proposed that STAT3 is an oncogene able to transform normal cells. STAT3 activation has been shown to be induced by a number of cytokines such as interleukin-6 in addition to insulin, epidermal growth factor, leptin, and platelet-derived growth factor (16Bromberg J.F. Breast Cancer Res. 2000; 2: 86-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). The activation of STAT3 by IFNs is of particular interest in that IFNs have strong antiproliferative effects and are considered potential cancer therapeutics. Activation of STAT3 by IFN has previously been suggested to proceed through interactions of STAT3 with IFNAR1 (17Yang C-H. Shi W. Basu L. Murti A. Constantinescu S.N. Blatts L. Croze E. Mullersman J.E. Pfeffer L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8057-8061Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar) and requires the catalytically active form of Janus kinase TYK2 (12Rani S.M.R. Leaman D.W. Han Y.

Other studies have implied that STAT3 binds to the cytoplasmic domain of IFNAR1 in a ligand-dependent manner and serves as an adapter protein in mediating the activation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (18Pfeffer L.M. Mullersman J.E. Pfeffer S.R. Murti A. Shi W. Yang C.-H. Science. 1997; 276: 1418-1420Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). Studies using chimeric forms of type I and type II IFN receptors expressed in a hamster cell background have demonstrated that the cytoplasmic domain of IFNAR2c may also play a role in STAT3 activation (11Kotenko S.V. Izotova L.S. Mirochnitchenko O.V. Lee C. Pestka S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 5007-5012Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar); however, the mechanism by which IFNAR2c interacts with and activates STAT3 remains unclear. Because of the emerging role of STAT3 as an important transcription factor involved in controlling cancer cell growth and differentiation and its potential role as an oncogene, we have performed a study to determine the role of the IFN receptor in the activation of STAT3. Here we demonstrate the direct activation of STAT3 by type I IFNs and identify the specific cytoplasmic tyrosine residues present in IFNAR2c that are required for STAT3 activation. The HT1080 cell line was purchased from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) and grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) containing 10% (v/v) bovine calf serum, l-glutamine, and 5% penicillin and streptomycin (Invitrogen) at 37 °C in 5% CO2. U5A (lacking IFNAR2c) and U6A (lacking STAT2) cells were obtained as described (19Pellegrini S. John J. Shearer M. Kerr I.M. Stark G.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 4605-4612Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar). Human IFNβ1b (specific activity 2.5 × 107 units/mg), IFNα2 (specific activity 3.0 × 108 units/mg), and IFNAR2c antiserum were obtained as described previously (6Wagner T.C. Velichko S. Vogel D.

STAT1, STAT2, STAT3, phosphotyrosine-specific STAT3 (pSTAT3), and phosphotyrosine-specific antibodies (pTyr) were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA. Horseradish peroxidase-coupled second antibodies were from BIOSOURCE International, Camarillo, CA. The production and characterization of stable human cell lines expressing IFNAR2c tyrosine mutants (Fig. 1) was described previously (6Wagner T.C. Velichko S. Vogel D. Rani S.M.R. Leung S.

Construction and expression of the 337Y512Y (Tyr337, Tyr512) and the 337F512F (Tyr269, Tyr306, Tyr316, Tyr318, Tyr411) mutants was performed as follows. The construct expressing the IFNAR2c double tyrosine mutant 337Y512Y was created using pZIFNαRβLYF (kindly provided by Dr. Oscar Colamonici, Department of Pharmacology, University of Chicago, Chicago, IL) as a template. Single nucleotide substitutions were made via site-directed mutagenesis to create phenylalanine to tyrosine substitutions at amino acid positions 337 and 512. The construct expressing the IFNAR2c mutant 337F512F was created using the Y512F plasmid (6Wagner T.C. Velichko S. Vogel D. Rani S.M.R. Leung S. Ransohoff R.M. Stark G.R. Perez H.D. Croze E. J. Biol.

U5A cells (1 × 106 cells/well) were transfected using Superfect transfection reagent (Qiagen Inc., Valencia, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Multiple stable cell lines for each IFNAR2c mutant were selected in growth media containing G-418 (0.5 mg/ml). After drug selection, cell populations expressing IFNAR2c were further selected using FACS and subcloning as described previously (6Wagner T.C. Velichko S. Vogel D. Rani S.M.R. Leung S.

All cell lines were selected to have IFNAR2c receptor levels and ligand binding properties equal to or greater than that observed for HT1080 cells (6Wagner T.C. Velichko S. Vogel D. Rani S.M.R.

Briefly, cells (1 × 107 cells) were grown in serum-free media for 1 h and left unstimulated or stimulated for 15 min with either IFNα2 (1000 units/106 cells) or IFNβ1b (1000 units/106 cells). After IFN treatment, cells were solubilized in lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing 1% Nonidet P-40 (v/v), 150 mm sodium chloride, 1 mm EDTA, 2.5% glycerol (v/v), 1.0 mm sodium fluoride, 1.0 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1.0 mmphenylmethysulfonyl fluoride, 0.5 μg/ml leupeptin, and 5.0 μg/ml trypsin inhibitor) for 30 min at 4 °C, and insoluble material was removed by centrifugation. For immunoprecipitation, the indicated antibodies were added to each sample, incubated overnight at 4 °C, mixed with protein G-agarose (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), and resolved by SDS-PAGE (10% Tris-HCl-glycine gels). Proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride filters (Problott, Applied Biosystems Inc., Foster City, CA) and incubated in blocking buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing 0.1% Tween 20 (v/v), 150 mm sodium chloride, 1 mm EDTA, 1.0 mm sodium fluoride, 1.0 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1.0 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1.0 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.5 μg/ml leupeptin and 5.0 μg/ml trypsin inhibitor) overnight at 4 °C, incubated with the appropriate antibody, and washed in blocking buffer. For detection of phosphorylated STAT1 and STAT2, the membrane was incubated with a monoclonal phosphotyrosine-specific antibody for 1 h followed by a mouse IgG-specific secondary antibody coupled to horseradish peroxidase, washed three times in blocking buffer, and developed using a chemiluminescent detection method (Pierce). Phosphorylated STAT3 was detected using a specific antibody that recognizes STAT3 phosphorylated at Tyr705 (pSTAT3). Detection of pSTAT3 was achieved by incubating the washed membrane with a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody. After washing, the blot was developed as described previously. To reprobe the immunoblots for STAT1, STAT2, or STAT3, membranes were incubated overnight in 0.01 m sodium citrate, pH 3.0, washed in blocking buffer, and reprobed with the appropriate antibody. Gel shift assays were performed using 32P-labeled double-stranded oligonucleotides, representing the high affinitysis-inducible element (hSIE, m67 variant, 5′-AGCTTCATTTCCCGTAAATCCCTA)-3′ that binds both STAT1 and STAT3 (20Garcia R.C., Yu, Y.-U. Hudnall A. Catlett R. Nelson K.L. Smithgall T. Fujita D.J. Ethier S.P. Jove R. Cell Growth Differ. 1997; 8: 1267-1276PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were stimulated with IFNα2 (1000 units/106cells) or IFNβ1b (1000 units/106 cells) for 15 min, and cell pellets were collected and processed for EMSA as described previously (6Wagner T.C. Velichko S. Vogel D. Rani S.M.R. Leung S. Ransohoff R.M. Stark G.R. Perez H.D. Croze E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 1493-1499Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Reaction mixtures were separated by electrophoresis through a 6% polyacrylamide gel and analyzed by autoradiography (21Wanger B.J. Hayes T.E. Hoban C.J. Cochran B.H. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 4477-4484Crossref PubMed Scopus (553) Google Scholar). Cells were seeded (4 × 104 cells/well) in a 24-well cell culture plate and allowed to attach overnight. Plasmid DNA containing a m67-luciferase reporter construct (gift from Dr. Jacqueline Bromberg, Department of Medicine, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Institute, New York) was transiently transfected into each cell line along with a control plasmid pRLTK (Promega, Madison, WI). Twenty-four hours after transfection, cells were incubated for 4 h with complete medium or medium containing 1000 units/ml IFNβ1b. Cells were then harvested and lysed, and luciferase activity was measured using a Dual Luciferase system (Promega). Luciferase activity was normalized for transfection efficiency using the co-transfected Renilla luciferase reporter plasmid, pRLTK. Cell lines expressing IFNAR2c tyrosine mutants were previously shown to bind IFN and express IFNAR2c at levels equal to or greater than the parental HT1080 cells by FACS and ligand binding (6Wagner T.C. Velichko S. Vogel D. Rani S.M.R. Leung S. Ransohoff R.M. Stark G.R. Perez H.D. Croze E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 1493-1499Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Two new cell lines, one in which Tyr337 and Tyr512 have been substituted to phenylalanine (337F512F) and the other having all tyrosines except Tyr337 and Tyr512substituted to phenylalanine (337Y512Y) were also demonstrated to bind IFN and express IFNAR2c at levels equal to or greater than HT1080 cells (data not shown). IFNAR2c tyrosine mutants used in this study are shown in Fig. 1. Using these cell lines, it was demonstrated that both IFNα and IFNβ1b induced the phosphorylation of STAT3 in HT1080 and the U5AR2c cell lines (Fig.2); however, IFNβ1b appeared to be more efficient than IFNα in activating STAT3 during the 15-min IFN stimulation period. As expected, STAT3 activation was not observed in the U5A or U5A7F cell lines (Fig. 2). The lack of STAT3 activation in the U5A7F cells demonstrates that STAT3 activation by type I IFNs is dependent on tyrosine residues present in the intracellular domain of IFNAR2c. In non-serum starved cells, low levels of STAT3 phosphorylation was observed in unstimulated cells suggesting a constitutive level of STAT3 activation (data not shown). STAT1 activation by IFN was previously shown to be dependent on the presence of STAT2 using a mutant cell line (U6A) deficient in STAT2 (22Leung S. Qureshi S.A. Kerr I.M. Darnell J.E. Stark G.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1312-1317Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It was therefore important to determine whether STAT3 activation by IFNs was also dependent on the presence of STAT2. U6A and HT1080 cells were stimulated with either IFNα or IFNβ1b, and activation of STAT1, STAT2, and STAT3 was determined as described under “Material and Methods.” As expected, U6A cells were unable to induce the phosphorylation of STAT1 after stimulation with IFNα or IFNβ1b (Fig. 3 A). In addition, stripping and reprobing the immunoblot for STAT1 and STAT2 confirmed the lack of STAT2 in U6A cells (Fig. 3 A). However, stimulation of U6A cells with IFN did result in the activation of STAT3 by both IFNα and IFNβ1b, although the level of activation of STAT3 was greater when cells were stimulated with IFNβ1b (Fig.3 B). Therefore activation of STAT3 by type I IFNs does not require the presence of STAT2. Cell lines stably expressing IFNAR2c in which all but one of the seven tyrosine residues in the cytoplasmic domain have been substituted to phenylalanine were tested for their ability to induce the activation of STAT3 in response to IFN stimulation (Fig.4). Surprisingly, two tyrosine residues, Tyr337 and Tyr512, which were previously demonstrated to be critical for STAT1 and STAT2 activation (6Wagner T.C. Velichko S. Vogel D. Rani S.M.R. Leung S. Ransohoff R.M. Stark G.R. Perez H.D. Croze E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 1493-1499Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), were also required for IFN-dependent STAT3 activation (Fig.4 B). To confirm this observation, two additional IFNAR2c tyrosine mutants were analyzed for IFN-dependent STAT3 activation. The first is a mutant in which both Tyr337 and Tyr512 were substituted with phenylalanine (337F512F). The second mutant (337Y512Y) has all cytoplasmic tyrosines substituted with phenylalanine except Tyr337and Tyr512. IFN stimulation of these cell lines revealed that STAT3 activation was observed only in 337Y512Y and not in 337F512F, ruling out the involvement of other tyrosine residues present in IFNAR2c (Tyr269, Tyr306 Tyr316, Tyr318, and Tyr411) in STAT3 activation (Fig.4 C). This observation is in agreement with previous results demonstrating the dependence on Tyr337 and Tyr512 in the activation of STAT1 and STAT2 by IFN (6Wagner T.C. Velichko S. Vogel D. Rani S.M.R. Leung S. Ransohoff R.M. Stark G.R. Perez H.D. Croze E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 1493-1499Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). IFN-dependent activation of STAT3 leads to the formation of homo- and heterodimeric transcription factors such as STAT3:STAT3 and STAT3:STAT1, which induce gene transcription upon binding to specific DNA elements in the promoter region of a number of genes (23Horvath C.M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 496-502Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar, 24Bromberg J.F. BioEssays. 2001; 23: 161-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). One such high-affinity DNA binding site for STAT3 is the m67element (13Bromberg J.F. Wrzeszczynska M.H. Devgan G. Zhao Y. Pestell R.G. Albanses C. Darnell J.E. Cell. 1999; 98: 295-303Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2486) Google Scholar). We next sought to determine whether IFN-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT3 leads to the formation of STAT3 transcription complexes that bind specific high-affinity STAT3 DNA binding elements. To investigate this possibility, EMSAs were performed using nuclear extracts prepared from IFN-stimulated cell lines each expressing a particular IFNAR2c tyrosine mutant (Fig. 5). Formation of STAT3 transcription complexes by IFN was observed in the parental HT1080 and U5AR2c cell lines. As expected, formation of STAT3 transcription complexes was not observed in U5A or U5A7F cells upon IFN stimulation (Fig. 5). However, a strong induction of STAT3 transcription complexes was observed in the 337Y512Y cell line, whereas none was detected in the 337F512F cell line, demonstrating the importance of Tyr337 and Tyr512 in STAT3 transcription complex formation. Low levels of constitutive STAT3 activation were occasionally observed in unstimulated cells. Identification of STAT3:STAT3 and STAT3:STAT1 protein-DNA complexes were confirmed by STAT3- or STAT1-specific supershift assay (data not shown). The dependence on Tyr337 and Tyr512 in STAT3 activation by IFN was further demonstrated by determining the IFN-dependent activation of a STAT3-specific reporter in various IFNAR2c tyrosine mutant cell lines. To demonstrate the induction of this reporter by IFN, cell lines expressing IFNAR2c tyrosine mutants were transiently transfected with anm67-luciferase reporter; after IFN stimulation the extent of induction of the reporter was determined (Fig.6). As expected, U5A and U5A7F cells were unable to induce activation of the m67-luciferase reporter after IFN stimulation, further supporting the observation that STAT3 activation requires IFNAR2c and proceeds through a mechanism involving cytoplasmic tyrosine residues present in this receptor chain. However, HT1080, U5AR2c, 337Y, and 512Y cells all strongly induced expression of the STAT3-dependent reporter in response to IFN stimulation (Fig. 6). Finally, the importance of Tyr337 or Tyr512 in STAT3-dependent induction of them67-luciferase reporter was confirmed by the observation that efficient reporter activation was observed only in the tyrosine mutant 337Y512Y and not in the 337F512F cell line (Fig. 6). The STAT family of proteins consist of seven different members, many of which can be activated directly by cytokines and growth factors. STAT proteins are involved in a number of important biological responses including, but not limited to, innate and adaptive immune responses, cell growth and regulation, apoptosis, and antiviral responses (1Catlett-Falcone R. Dalton W.S. Jove R. Cur. Opin. Oncol. 1999; 11: 490-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar, 16Bromberg J.F. Breast Cancer Res. 2000; 2: 86-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 26Darnell J.E. Science. 1997; 277: 1630-1635Crossref PubMed Scopus (3356) Google Scholar). One common feature within the protein structure of all STATs is the presence of a Src homology 2 (SH2) domain. SH2 domains bind specifically to phosphotyrosines and can thereby mediate the recruitment of STATs to the cytoplasmic domain of cell surface receptors. In addition, phosphorylation of STAT proteins themselves leads to their homo- or heterodimerization, subsequent nuclear localization, and activation of transcription. The activation of STATs is tightly controlled by tyrosine phosphorylation, and the control of STAT activation appears to be of universal importance in that similar STAT activation mechanisms occur in organisms ranging from slime molds to humans (23Horvath C.M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 496-502Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar). Recently, STAT1, STAT3, and STAT5 have been implicated in a number of cancer types (1Catlett-Falcone R. Dalton W.S. Jove R. Cur. Opin. Oncol. 1999; 11: 490-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar, 16Bromberg J.F. Breast Cancer Res. 2000; 2: 86-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 24Bromberg J.F. BioEssays. 2001; 23: 161-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). STAT3 itself has been suggested to have oncogenic properties and is constitutively activated in a number of tumor cell lines (13Bromberg J.F. Wrzeszczynska M.H. Devgan G. Zhao Y. Pestell R.G. Albanses C. Darnell J.E. Cell. 1999; 98: 295-303Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2486) Google Scholar). Although STAT3 and STAT1 are highly homologous, they appear to have divergent functions. An example of this is the observation that in knock-out mice STAT3 but not STAT1 is embryonic lethal (27Takeda K. Noguchi K. Shi W. Tanaka T. Matsumoto M. Yoshida N. Kishimoto T. Akira S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3801-3804Crossref PubMed Scopus (1092) Google Scholar). In addition, it has been shown that STAT3 and not STAT1 specifically interacts with c-jun to activate the α2-macroglobulin promoter (28Zhang X. Wrzeszczynska M.H. Horvath C.M. Darnell J.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7138-7146Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Finally, although tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT3 and STAT1 is required for their activation, serine phosphorylation also appears to be required for maximal transcriptional activity (29Wen Z. Zhong Z. Darnell J.E. Cell. 1995; 82: 241-250Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1735) Google Scholar). IFN-dependent STAT3 activation has been documented in a number of studies, but the mechanism of activation by IFNs remains unclear. Previous studies demonstrated that STAT3 interacts with IFNAR1 and mediates the subsequent activation of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase signaling pathway (18Pfeffer L.M. Mullersman J.E. Pfeffer S.R. Murti A. Shi W. Yang C.-H. Science. 1997; 276: 1418-1420Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). Further evidence supporting the interaction of IFNAR1 and STAT3 was provided by the discovery of a specific STAT3 motif, YxxQ, present in the cytoplasmic domain of IFNAR1. This motif was shown to be responsible for mediating the interaction between STAT3 and gp130 (30Stahl, N., Farruggella, T. J., Boulton, T. G., Zhong, Z., Darnell, J. E., and Yancopoulos, G. D. Science, 267, 1349–1353.Google Scholar, 31Abe K. Hirai M. Mizuno K. Higashi N. Sekimoto T. Miki T. Hirano T. Nakajima K. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 3464-3474Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Recent studies have extended these observations to demonstrate that IFN- dependent phosphorylation of IFNAR1 and STAT3 requires the Janus tyrosine kinase TYK2 (12Rani S.M.R. Leaman D.W. Han Y. Leung S. Croze E. Fish E.N. Wolfman A. Ransohoff R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 32507-32511Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). However, other studies have called into question the exact role of IFNAR1 in the activation of both STAT2 and STAT3 by demonstrating that switching the entire cytoplasmic domain of IFNAR1 with that of another receptor (11Kotenko S.V. Izotova L.S. Mirochnitchenko O.V. Lee C. Pestka S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 5007-5012Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) or substituting all cytoplasmic tyrosines to phenylalanines (9Gibbs V.C. Takahashi M. Aguet M. Chuntharapai A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28710-28716Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) had no effect on STAT activation. Early events in IFN signaling require ligand-dependent receptor assembly, receptor phosphorylation, and STAT activation. Other studies have extended these observations to demonstrate the requirement of specific tyrosine residues present in the cytoplasmic domain of IFNAR2c in both STAT1 and STAT2 activation. In these studies it was suggested that elimination of both Tyr337 and Tyr512 could result in a receptor unable to activate STAT1 or STAT2 in response to IFN stimulation (6Wagner T.C. Velichko S. Vogel D. Rani S.M.R. Leung S. Ransohoff R.M. Stark G.R. Perez H.D. Croze E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 1493-1499Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). These results showed that IFN-dependent activation of STAT1 and STAT2 proceeds through the redundant usage of Tyr337 and Tyr512. However, the role of specific tyrosines present in the cytoplasmic domain of IFNAR2c in the activation of STAT3 remained to be established. To address this question we made use of IFNAR2c tyrosine mutants stably expressed in a human cell background to identify tyrosine residues important for STAT3 activation. Analysis of a number of IFNAR2c tyrosine mutants demonstrated that two tyrosines, Tyr337and Tyr512, previously shown to be important for STAT1 and STAT2 activation were also required for STAT3 activation. The role of these two tyrosine residues in STAT3 activation was demonstrated by different methods including the measurement of STAT3 phosphorylation, formation of STAT3 transcription complexes, and the IFN-dependent induction of a STAT3 reporter. Collectively these results all demonstrate the requirement for Tyr337and Tyr512 in STAT3 activation. Multiple STAT activation via the overlapping usage of specific tyrosine residues within the same receptor chain has been demonstrated previously for other receptors. An example of this is the human growth hormone receptor, in which activation of STAT1, STAT3, and STAT5 requires the presence of either Tyr333 or Tyr338, are located in the cytoplasmic domain of the receptor (32Smit L.S. Meyer D.J. Billestrup N. Schwartz G. Carter-Su C. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 519-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). This observation parallels those made in the present study. The recognition of identical tyrosines residues by different STATs strongly suggests that such tyrosine residues are uniquely located within the cytoplasmic domain of these receptors and are likely unhindered substrates for receptor-associated tyrosine kinases or docking sites for STATs, adapter proteins, or certain phosphatases. It has been shown previously that IFN-dependent activation of STAT1 was inhibited in a mutant human cell line (U6A) lacking STAT2 (22Leung S. Qureshi S.A. Kerr I.M. Darnell J.E. Stark G.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1312-1317Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Such an observation demonstrates the requirement for STAT2 for STAT1 activation and suggests a mechanistic association between STAT1 and STAT2. In the present study we show that STAT3 activation occurs unabated in U6A cells, demonstrating that STAT3 activation is not dependent on the presence of STAT2. Therefore, although Tyr337 and Tyr512are required for activation of all three STATs the exact mechanism of activation for STAT1 and STAT2 may be somewhat different from that observed for STAT3. Distinct mechanisms of activation of STAT1, STAT2, and STAT3 by IFNs is supported by recent studies in which it was shown that piceatannol, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor, inhibited the IFN-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT3 and STAT5 but not of STAT1 and STAT2 in a Burkitt's lymphoma human B cell line (33Su L. David M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 12661-12666Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). The absolute requirement of either Tyr337 and Tyr512 for STAT1, STAT2, and STAT3 activation suggests a specific interaction of these STATs with Tyr337 and Tyr512. Both Tyr337 and Tyr512 are separated by a stretch of 175 amino acid residues, placing these amino acid residues at the distal end of the IFNAR2c receptor chain. Examination of the amino acid residues present in this region failed to identify a STAT3 tyrosine-based activation motif (YxxQ) similar to one previously found associated with IFNAR1 and gp130. Surprisingly, a previously unidentified conserved amino acid motif, GxGYxM, was found associated with both Tyr337and Tyr512 and not with any other tyrosine residue present in the cytoplasmic domain of IFNAR2c or IFNAR1 (Fig. 7). A data base search using this protein motif revealed no significant sequence alignments with other known motifs. Although STATs are large proteins relative to the cytoplasmic domain of either IFN receptor chain, it is possible that more than one STAT can interact with IFNAR2c simultaneously or in rapid succession allowing for efficient STAT1, STAT2, and STAT3 activation. The simplest model for IFN-dependent STAT activation would first involve the binding of STATs to phosphorylated Tyr337 or Tyr512 through an interaction with the STAT-SH2 domain. Once bound to the receptor chain, the STATs themselves become substrates for the receptor-associated Janus tyrosine kinases and become phosphorylated on specific tyrosines. Phosphorylated STATs then associate with each other as homo- or heterodimers, dissociate from the receptor, and translocate into the cell nucleus initiating gene expression. However, recent studies using GST-STAT or GST-IFNAR2c constructs to co-precipitate STAT1 and STAT2 suggest that STAT1 and STAT2 preassociate with IFNAR2c in a ligand-independent manner (34Li X. Leung S. Kerr I.M. Stark G.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2048-2056Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar,35Nguyen V-P. Saleh A.Z.M. Arch A.E. Yan H. Piazza F. Kim J. Krolewski J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 9713-9721Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). These studies suggest that STAT1 and STAT2 initially interact with IFNAR2c independently of SH2 domain interactions via protein-protein interactions yet to be completely defined. Therefore, the role of specific IFNAR2c-associated phosphotyrosines in JAK-STAT signaling could be independent of any initial receptor docking event. It is clear that tyrosines present in the cytoplasmic domain of IFNAR2c are required for IFN signaling and STAT activation (6Wagner T.C. Velichko S. Vogel D. Rani S.M.R. Leung S. Ransohoff R.M. Stark G.R. Perez H.D. Croze E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 1493-1499Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Accordingly, the interaction of STATs with phosphorylated tyrosines on IFNAR2c could occur after STAT docking to the IFN receptor. Regardless of the role of Tyr337and Tyr512 in the docking of STATs to the IFN receptor, regulation of JAK-STAT signaling is likely to be achieved in part through the interaction of the STAT-SH2 domain with these tyrosines. We propose that such an interaction leads to a conformational change within the STAT protein itself in which specific tyrosines, most likely STAT1, Tyr701, STAT2, Tyr689, and STAT3, Tyr705 (23Horvath C.M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 496-502Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar) become high affinity substrates for the receptor-associated Janus tyrosine kinases JAK1 or TYK2. The tyrosine phosphorylation of receptor-associated STATs would then allow for their homo- or heterodimerization, dissociation from the receptor, and induction of IFN-responsive genes. It is also likely that these tyrosines play an additional role in mediating IFN signaling by interacting with adapter molecules, phosphatases, or other kinases. A model outlining a proposed mechanism of STAT activation by IFN is shown in Fig.8. The docking of STAT proteins to specific IFNAR2c tyrosine mutants is currently under investigation. Results from these studies should help to further define the role of IFNAR2c tyrosine residues in mediating the direct docking and subsequent activation of STATs by IFN. A number of unanswered questions still remain concerning the mechanism of activation of STATs by IFNs. Specific adapter proteins have been implicated in regulating the association of STATs with various cytokine receptors or associated kinases (18Pfeffer L.M. Mullersman J.E. Pfeffer S.R. Murti A. Shi W. Yang C.-H. Science. 1997; 276: 1418-1420Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar, 36Usacheva A. Smith R. Minshall R. Baida G. Seng S. Croze E. Colamonici O. J. Biol.

Leukemia. 1999; 13: 760-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is possible that although Tyr337 and Tyr512 are required for STAT activation the differences observed between the activation of STAT1, STAT2, and STAT3 in U6A cells may be explained by a required interaction of a particular STAT protein with an adapter molecule. Furthermore, an interaction of the IFN receptor with gp130, which is known to mediate STAT3 activation, has also been suggested (25Mitani Y. Takaoka A. Kim S. Kato Y. Yokochi T. Tanaka N. Taniguchi T. Genes Cells. 2001; 6: 631-640Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). If such an interaction does indeed occur, it would provide yet another possible mechanism by which STAT3 could initially associate with the IFN receptor prior to activation. Finally, our results clearly identify for the first time the importance of Tyr337and Tyr512 in the activation of STAT3 by IFN. STAT3 activation and receptor function is achieved when either Tyr337or Tyr512 is present, demonstrating that a single tyrosine is able to sustain normal STAT3 activation and IFN signaling. Furthermore, this is the first demonstration of the overlapping usage of cytoplasmic tyrosines by the IFN receptor in the activation of multiple STATs, such as STAT1, STAT2, and STAT3. In addition, this work further supports the observation that IFN-dependent signaling through the JAK-STAT pathway proceeds through the redundant usage of two tyrosines residues in the cytoplasmic domain of IFNAR2c.

The innermost chloroplast membrane, the thylakoid membrane, separates the stroma from the thylakoid lumen and is the site of light-driven photophosphorylation. Although chloroplasts possess their own genome and protein synthesis machinery, the majority of thylakoid proteins are encoded in the nucleus, synthesized in the cytoplasm, and imported into the stroma by a general protein translocase in the envelope. Imported precursor proteins are processed to pathway intermediates in the stroma and then enter one of four different targeting pathways for localization to the thylakoids (1Cline K. Henry R. Annu.

The cpSRP-dependent pathway appears to specifically target the light-harvesting chlorophyll-binding proteins that use an Albino3-containing translocase for integration into the thylakoid membrane (3Moore M.

Whereas the 54-kDa subunit of cpSRP (cpSRP54) is thought to bind one of three hydrophobic domains, the 43-kDa subunit of cpSRP (cpSRP43) binds an 18-residue hydrophilic domain (L18) located between the second and the third transmembrane helices of LHCP (8DeLille J.

Interaction between cpSRP43 and L18 is required for LHCP-targeting complex formation with cpSRP and confers cpSRP54 with its unique posttranslational binding activity.

As previous studies on reconstituting LHCP integration have never been conducted in the absence of wheat germ extract or reticulocyte lysate, it is not known whether additional soluble components are required for LHCP integration. In the present study, we have reconstituted the LHCP integration reaction using purified recombinant substrate (HisLHCP), purified recombinant soluble protein components (cpSRP54his, HiscpSRP43, Trx-cpFtsY), and salt-washed thylakoids. Our data demonstrate that GTP, cpSRP54, cpSRP43, and cpFtsY are the only soluble components required for LHCP integration into salt-washed thylakoids. Further, our studies reveal that ATP, though not essential, greatly stimulates LHCP integration into thylakoid membranes. ATP stimulates LHCP integration by a mechanism independent of the ΔpH previously shown to enhance LHCP integration into isolated thylakoids. As ATP shows no effect on the formation of the soluble LHCP-cpSRP-targeting complex, we propose that an ATP-binding protein at the membrane is involved in LHCP integration into thylakoid membranes. First strand synthesis of the full-length cpSRP43 coding sequence was obtained using Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Stratagene) according to the manufacturer's instructions in a reaction containing totalArabidopsis RNA and a reverse primer complimentary to the stop codon and the last 25 bases of cpSRP43. PCR amplification of the first strand was accomplished by adding a forward primer corresponding to the first 25 bases of the cpSRP43 precursor and containing anEcoRI site at the 5′ end. The resulting PCR product was restricted with EcoRI and inserted into pGEM-4Z (Promega) atEcoRI and SmaI sites to generate pGEM-pcpSRP43. DNA sequencing analysis revealed pGEM-pcpSRP43 codes for an arginine at amino acid position 140 rather than a lysine in the original cpSRP43 sequence (GenBankTM accession no. AAD01509). The coding sequence for the precursor form of cpFtsY was amplified fromArabidopsis RNA by reverse transcription-PCR using ThermoScript reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) and ligated intoSmaI-restricted pGEM-4Z in the SP6 direction to create pcpFtsY4Z. The sequence was deposited to GenBankTM data base (accession no. AF120112). The coding sequence for mature LHCP, starting with amino acid sequence MRKSATT, was PCR-amplified from psAB80XD/4 (12Cline K. Fulsom D.R. Viitanen P.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 14225-14232Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and cloned into pQE-80L (Qiagen) using BamHI and SmaI sites to produce pQE-LHCP. The coding sequence for mature cpSRP54, starting with amino acid sequence MFGQLTG, was amplified from pNH2 (13Franklin A.E. Hoffman N.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22175-22180Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) using a reverse primer that introduced six histidines (His6) at the C terminus. The resulting PCR product was cloned into pPROLar.A122 (CLONTECH) using KpnI and HindIII sites to generate pPROLar-cpSRP54his. The coding sequence for mature cpSRP43, starting with amino acid sequence AAVQRNY, was amplified from pGEM-pcpSRP43, cloned into the BamHI and EcoRI sites of pGEX-6P-2 (Amersham Biosciences), and later subcloned into pQE-80L using BamHI and SmaI to generate pQE-cpSRP43. The coding sequence for mature cpFtsY, starting with amino acid sequence MACSAGP, was amplified from pcpFtsY4Z and cloned into pET-32b(+) (Novagen) using NcoI and HindIII sites. The resulting clone pET-Trx-cpFtsY expresses a thioredoxin-cpFtsY fusion protein. All constructs were verified by sequencing analysis. Expression plasmids were transformed intoEscherichia coli strain BL21* (Invitrogen), and cells were cultured in LB medium. Cells were induced with 0.5 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside to express HisLHCP, HiscpSRP43, and Trx-cpFtsY or with 0.5 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside plus 0.2%l-(+)-arabinose to express cpSRP54his. HiscpSRP43, cpSRP54his, and Trx-cpFtsY were produced as soluble proteins and isolated with TALON metal affinity resin (CLONTECH). HiscpSRP43 was further purified by anion exchange, cpSRP54his by cation exchange, and Trx-cpFtsY by S-protein-agarose (Novagen) affinity chromatography. HisLHCP was expressed in the presence of [S35]methionine and isolated as inclusion bodies according to Cline et al. (14Cline K. Henry R., Li, C. Yuan J. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 4105-4114Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). HisLHCP was dissolved in 6 m guanidine hydrochloride, bound to TALON metal affinity resin, buffer exchanged into 6 m urea in 20 mm Hepes/KOH (pH 8.0) and eluted with 150 mm imidazole in 6 m urea and 20 mmHepes/KOH (pH 8.0). Imidazole was removed by centrifugation through Microcon Centrifugal Filter Devices (Millipore). Chloroplasts were isolated from 10- to 11-day-old pea seedlings (Laxton's Progress) as described (15Yuan J. Henry R. Cline K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Salt-washed thylakoids were prepared by washing isolated thylakoids two times with 1 m potassium acetate in import buffer (IB) (50 mm Hepes/KOH (pH 8.0), 330 mmsorbitol) and two times with IB plus 10 mmMgCl2. Thylakoids were resuspended in IB with 10 mm MgCl2 and 5 mmdithiothreitol. Integration assays were carried out as described in Cline et al. (14Cline K. Henry R., Li, C. Yuan J. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 4105-4114Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Assays (40 μl) for transit complex formation were performed according to Payan and Cline (5Payan L.A. Cline K. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 112: 603-613Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) with modifications. Complex formation was initiated by adding urea-denatured HisLHCP (0.05 μg) to the reaction mixture containing cpSRP54his (4 μg), HiscpSRP43 (4 μg), 1 mm ATP, and 1 mmGTP or otherwise specified. The urea content in the reaction mixture was 0.23 m. Assays were executed by incubating the reaction mixture at 25 °C for 30 min. Transit complex formation was analyzed by native gel electrophoresis and visualized by phosphorimaging. Chl concentrations were determined according to Arnon (16Arnon D.I. Plant Physiol. 1949; 24: 1-15Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were estimated by Coomassie Blue staining of purified proteins along with protein standards. Quantification of phosphorimages was performed with ImageQuant software (Amersham Biosciences). A minimal requirement for LHCP integration into isolated thylakoids has been shown previously to include GTP, cpSRP54, cpSRP43, and cpFtsY (11Tu C.-J. Schuenemann D. Hoffman N.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 27219-27224Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). However, the possibility that additional soluble protein(s) might have contributed was not ruled out because of the presence of a complex mixture of proteins in wheat germ extract or reticulocyte lysate employed for protein synthesis in vitro. To address whether cpSRP54, cpSRP43, and cpFtsY were sufficient in supporting integration, we prepared purified recombinant proteins (Fig.1A) and reconstituted the integration reaction using thylakoids washed with salt to remove residual cpFtsY and cpSRP from the membrane (Fig. 1B). Proper integration was demonstrated by the presence of a characteristic degradation product of LHCP (LHCP-DP). A smaller degradation product marked with a star (*) was shown previously to be a properly inserted but not fully assembled species of LHCP (17Reed J.E. Cline K. Stephens L.C. Bacot K.O. Viitanen P.V. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 194: 33-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig.1B, LHCP integration occurred only when recombinant cpSRP54, cpSRP43, and cpFtsY were all included in the assay (lane 8). No integration of LHCP was obtained in the absence of any of the three proteins (lanes 1–7). Assays carried out in the presence of cpSRP and the Trx portion of the Trx-cpFtsY fusion protein did not support LHCP integration (data not shown), indicating that integration with Trx-cpFtsY resulted from the activity of cpFtsY. These results demonstrate that cpSRP54, cpSRP43, and cpFtsY are the only soluble protein components required for LHCP integration. Some protease-resistant HisLHCP together with some minor degradation products were observed to associate with the membranes in assays lacking cpSRP54his or HiscpSRP43 (Fig. 1B, lanes 1 and 4). It has been demonstrated that denatured LHCP precursor protein interacts with thylakoids nonproductively in the absence of stromal proteins (15Yuan J. Henry R. Cline K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8552-8556Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The undigested HisLHCP may represent aggregates that are resistant to protease digestion. It is possible that the readiness of LHCP to adhere to thylakoids is a manifestation of its tendency to nonproductively insert and aggregate at the membrane. Before the identification of cpSRP, it was shown that one role of the stromal factor in LHCP integration was to keep LHCP soluble and translocation-competent (5Payan L.A. Cline K. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 112: 603-613Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The nucleotide requirement for LHCP integration has been the subject of considerable study and debate. Early studies indicated that ATP is required for integration (12Cline K. Fulsom D.R. Viitanen P.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 14225-14232Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18Cline K. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 14804-14810Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Cline K. Ettinger W.F. Theg S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 2688-2696Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Later, in light of the newly identified chloroplast homologue of SRP54 (13Franklin A.E. Hoffman N.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22175-22180Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), a more careful examination of the nucleotide requirement implicated GTP as the only nucleotide required for integration (20Hoffman N.E. Franklin A.E. Plant Physiol. 1994; 105: 295-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). However, as ATP, CTP, and UTP all supported a low level of integration in the absence of GTP, a possible role of these nucleotides in LHCP integration was not ruled out (20Hoffman N.E. Franklin A.E. Plant Physiol. 1994; 105: 295-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). It has been suggested that the same enzyme that utilizes GTP also uses ATP, CTP, and UTP to a slight extent to support integration (20Hoffman N.E. Franklin A.E. Plant Physiol. 1994; 105: 295-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). An alternative explanation is that ATP, CTP, and UTP are used by kinases present in stromal extract and translation mixture to generate GTP by phosphorylating guanine-containing nucleotides retained in the stromal extract or the translation mixture. To resolve this issue, we examined the nucleotide requirement for LHCP integration in a reconstituted integration assay with purified recombinant LHCP, cpSRP, cpFtsY, and salt-washed thylakoids (Fig.2). GTP was absolutely required for LHCP integration; ATP (lane 2), CTP (lane 4), or UTP (lane 5) alone did not support appreciable integration. However, when ATP (lane 8) but not CTP (lane 9) or UTP (lane 10) was used in combination with GTP, integration of LHCP was enhanced more than 70%. Interestingly, AMP-PNP, a non-hydrolyzable analogue of ATP, also noticeably stimulated GTP-supported LHCP integration (lane 11). GMP-PNP (a non-hydrolyzable analogue of GTP) severely inhibited GTP-supported integration (lane 12), demonstrating that hydrolysis of GTP is required for LHCP integration. In all experiments, we have consistently observed a 30–50% stimulation of LHCP integration by AMP-PNP in combination with GTP (data not shown). A similar level of stimulation in LHCP integration by AMP-PNP was also obtained by Jiang et al.(21Jiang F., Yi, L. Moore M. Chen M. Rohl T. van Wijk K.-J. de Gier J.-W. Henry R. Dalbey R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 19281-19288Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The fact that a non-hydrolyzable analogue of ATP stimulates LHCP integration indicates that hydrolysis is not a requirement for ATP to stimulate integration. Because ADP and AMP were found to have no effect on GTP-supported LHCP integration (data not shown), it appears that ATP is employed as a regulatory element and not used as an energy source in promoting LHCP integration. The fact that LHCP integration levels were the same using 1 mm GTP or 2 mm GTP, but nearly doubled by addition of 1 mm ATP to assays containing 1 mm GTP (data not shown) demonstrates that the stimulation by ATP is not due to a dose effect of nucleotide or contaminating GTP in the ATP preparation. LHCP integration is stimulated by the ΔpH that forms during light-driven electron transport or through reverse proton pumping by the coupling factor in the presence of hydrolyzable ATP (12Cline K. Fulsom D.R. Viitanen P.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 14225-14232Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,19Cline K. Ettinger W.F. Theg S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 2688-2696Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22Yuan J. Cline K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18463-18467Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To assess whether the ATP stimulation of LHCP integration is associated with the use of ATP to enhance the production of a ΔpH, we examined the effect of ATP on LHCP integration in the presence of nigericin, which dissipates the ΔpH. As shown in Fig.3, nigericin was able to deplete the ΔpH and severely reduced the level of LHCP integration in light or in dark (compare lane 1 with lane 3; lane 2 with lane 4; lane 7 with lane 9; lane 8 with lane 10). Nevertheless, the ability of ATP to stimulate integration was not affected by the presence of nigericin. ATP stimulated LHCP integration both in the presence (compare lane 1 with lane 2; lane 5 with lane 6; lane 7 with lane 8; lane 11 with lane 12) and in the absence (comparing lane 3 with lane 4;lane 9 with lane 10) of the ΔpH, demonstrating that ATP is able to stimulate LHCP integration via a ΔpH-independent mechanism. We also examined the effect of ATP on LHCP integration in the presence of tentoxin, which binds to coupling factor 1 of the coupling factor and prevents ATP from being used to generate a ΔpH or add to an existing ΔpH (19Cline K. Ettinger W.F. Theg S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 2688-2696Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As light provides energy for making the ΔpH, tentoxin showed no effect on LHCP integration in light (comparelane 1 with lane 5; lane 2 withlane 6), which also serves as evidence for tentoxin not having any effect on the protein targeting/integration machinery. In dark, tentoxin had little influence on LHCP integration in the absence of ATP (compare lane 7 with lane 11) but severely inhibited LHCP integration in the presence of ATP (compare lane 8 with lane 12), demonstrating that tentoxin is able to prevent an ATP contribution to the ΔpH and exerts its effect on integration through preventing ATP hydrolysis by the coupling factor. Yet, in light or in dark relative to GTP alone, ATP was able to stimulate LHCP integration in the presence of tentoxin (comparelane 5 with lane 6; lane 11 withlane 12), which further establishes that one role of ATP is to promote the ΔpH-independent integration of LHCP. The targeting of LHCP to the thylakoid membrane is a multi-step process. The first major step in this process is the formation of a soluble targeting complex termed “transit complex” previously shown to contain LHCP, cpSRP54, and cpSRP43 (6Li X. Henry R. Yuan J. Cline K. Hoffman N.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 3789-3793Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar, 7Schuenemann D. Gupta S. Persello-Cartieaux F. Klimyuk V.I. Jones J.D.G. Nussaume L.

Chem. 2000; 275: 13187-13190Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Although there is evidence that purified precursor LHCP interacts with purified cpSRP, a transit complex made of only the three proteins has not been demonstrated directly (7Schuenemann D. Gupta S. Persello-Cartieaux F. Klimyuk V.I. Jones J.D.G. Nussaume L. Hoffman N.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 10312-10316Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). As cpFtsY is required for LHCP integration and the majority of cpFtsY is present in the stroma (11Tu C.-J. Schuenemann D. Hoffman N.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 27219-27224Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar), it is possible that cpFtsY is involved in transit complex formation. To resolve this issue, the requirements for forming the soluble LHCP targeting complex were examined with purified components. As shown in Fig. 4A, in the absence of soluble proteins all of the radiolabeled HisLHCP remained in the sample well (lane 1). When individual cpSRP54his (lane 2), HiscpSRP43 (lane 3), or Trx-cpFtsY (lane 4) was added to the assay, a varying, small amount of labeled HisLHCP migrated into the gel (lanes 2–4), suggesting some interaction between HisLHCP and the individual proteins. However, the interaction between HisLHCP and the individual protein components is very weak compared with the ability of cpSRP (a complex of cpSRP54his and HiscpSRP43) to promote formation of the transit complex (lane 5). Neither a combination of cpSRP54his and Trx-cpFtsY (lane 6) nor a combination of HiscpSRP43 and Trx-cpFtsY (lane 7) promoted transit complex formation. In fact, Trx-cpFtsY reduced the level of cpSRP-mediated transit complex formation (lane 8), suggesting that Trx-cpFtsY may interact with the transit complex to promote HisLHCP release when the targeting complex reaches the membrane. Regardless, our results have conclusively demonstrated that cpSRP54 and cpSRP43 are the only protein components required for forming the soluble LHCP targeting complex. Although there is no evidence for a nucleotide requirement in LHCP transit complex formation, we assessed the possibility that the ΔpH-independent stimulation of integration by ATP might be due to an increase in transit complex formation. We examined the effect of various nucleotides on the formation of the transit complex with purified HisLHCP, HiscpSRP43, and cpSRP54his. As shown in Fig.4B, no nucleotide is required for the formation of the transit complex (lane 1). The addition of ATP (lane 2), AMP-PNP (lane 3), CTP (lane 7), UTP (lane 8), a combination of ATP and GTP (lane 9), or a combination of AMP-PNP and GTP (lane 10) showed no detectable effect on the amount of transit complex formed. GTP (lane 4), GDP (lane 5), GMP-PNP (lane 6), GTP plus GMP-PNP (lane 11), GTP plus CTP (lane 12), or GTP plus UTP (lane 13) had only a very minor inhibitory effect on the formation of the transit complex. At the present, we do not know whether the minor inhibitory effect caused by guanine nucleotides has any biological significance. It is attractive to hypothesize that GTP or GDP binding to cpSRP54 weakens the interaction between LHCP and cpSRP and causes release of LHCP from cpSRP. Empty site forms of SRP54 and SRP receptor α-subunit GTPases are believed to mediate targeting of ribosome-nascent chain complexes to the endoplasmic reticulum (23Rapiejko P.J. Gilmore R. Cell. 1997; 89: 703-713Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Regardless, our results have clearly shown that the ATP-stimulated integration reported in this study is not due to an effect of ATP on the formation of the soluble LHCP targeting complex. The fact that LHCP integration occurs in the absence of the chloroplast SecA (cpSecA) ATPase (this study) and is unaffected by azide, a potent inhibitor of cpSecA (24Yuan J. Henry R. McCaffery M. Cline K. Science. 1994; 266: 796-798Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar), rules out the possibility that cpSecA is responsible for the ATP stimulation of LHCP integration. Rather, our studies suggest the involvement of a thylakoid ATP-binding protein in LHCP integration into thylakoid membranes.

CCAAT/enhance-binding protein cyclin-dependent kinase granulocyte colony-stimulating factor receptor acute myelogenous leukemia nuclear extract histidine histone H1 Several transcription factors are master regulators of hematopoiesis, regulating the development of multi-potential precursor cells into terminally differentiated blood cells. In myeloid differentiation, several transcription factors, including PU.1, AML1, c-Myb, retinoic acid receptor α, and the CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein (C/EBP)1 family, have been shown to be key players (for review see Refs. 1Shivdasani R.

The C/EBPs are transcription factors belonging to the bZIP subgroup, which is characterized by the presence of a basic region involved in DNA binding and a leucine zipper region that mediates homo- and heterodimerization between family members (for review see Ref. 3Lekstrom-Himes J. Xanthopoulos K.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28545-28548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (684) Google Scholar). Gene targeting studies in mice have revealed an essential role for several of these proteins in the development of specific blood cell lineages. C/EBPβ-deficient mice have defects in expansion of B lymphocytes (4Chen X. Liu W. Ambrosino C. Ruocco M.R. Poli V. Romani L. Quinto I. Barbieri S. Holmes K.L. Venuta S. Scala G. Blood. 1997; 90: 156-164PubMed Google Scholar) and produce dysfunctional monocytes, but they have normal granulocytes (5Screpanti I. Romani L. Musiani P. Modesti A. Fattori E. Lazzaro D. Sellitto C. Scarpa S. Bellavia D. Lattanzio G. Bistoni F. Frati L. Cortese R. Gulino A. Ciliberto G. Costantini F. Poli V. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1932-1941Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar). C/EBPα-deficient mice are blocked in granulocyte development at a very early stage; however, all other blood lineages, including blood monocytes and tissue macrophages, are normal (6Zhang D.E. Zhang P. Wang N.D. Hetherington C.J. Darlington G.J. Tenen D.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 569-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (750) Google Scholar). C/EBPε-deficient mice are blocked at the last stage of neutrophil maturation, placing C/EBPε downstream of C/EBPα in regulation of myeloid differentiation (7Yamanaka R. Barlow C. Lekstrom-Himes J.

A. 1997; 99: 13187-13192Crossref Scopus (302) Google Scholar).Despite the fact that C/EBPα is required for myeloid differentiationin vivo, its precise role in these cells is not clear. C/EBPα is sufficient for granulocyte differentiation, and forced expression of C/EBPα after the initiation of monocyte differentiation redirects the cells to become granulocytes (8Radomska H.S.

C/EBPα has been shown to regulate expression of several myeloid genes including granulocyte-colony stimulating factor receptor (G-CSFR) (6Zhang D.E. Zhang P. Wang N.D. Hetherington C.J.

Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4717-4725Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar) in vivo. The lack of G-CSFR in C/EBPα knockout mice may partially account for the lack of granulocyte differentiation in these mice; however, both G-CSF- and G-CSFR-deficient mice retain the ability to produce granulocytes, albeit at a reduced number (12Lieschke G.J.

Link D.C. Immunity. 1999; 11: 153-161Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). In contrast, the C/EBPα knockout animals are completely lacking granulocytes, suggesting that C/EBPα regulates additional genes that are required for granulopoiesis.The block in differentiation of myeloid precursors and the accumulation of myeloblasts in fetal livers and peripheral blood of C/EBPα−/− mice is similar to that found in acute myelogenous leukemia (AML). The importance of C/EBPα in AML is heightened with recent findings that C/EBPα is mutated in a significant number of AML patients (M2 subtype) that have no known karyotype abnormalities (14Pabst T. Mueller B.U. Zhang P. Radomska H.S. Narravula S. Schnittger S. Behre G. Hiddemann W. Tenen D.G. Nat. Genet. 2001; 27: 263-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (735) Google Scholar) and that down-regulation of C/EBPα occurs in t(8;21) myeloid leukemia by the AML1-ETO fusion protein (15Pabst T. Mueller B.U.

These studies, as well as studies in C/EBPα−/− mice, indicate that C/EBPα is a master regulator of myelopoiesis. Understanding key targets of C/EBPα that are involved in myelopoiesis is an important step in beginning to discern the mechanisms involved in normal myeloid cell differentiation and in the development of AML.Calpains are a family of intracellular cysteine proteases that are generally calcium-dependent and are involved in a variety of cell functions including signal transduction, cell division, cell differentiation, and apoptosis (for review see Ref. 16Sorimachi H. Ishiura S. Suzuki K. Biochem. J. 1997; 328: 721-732Crossref PubMed Scopus (618) Google Scholar). The substrates for calpains in vivo are not well defined; however, several molecules with regulatory functions have been reported to be substrates for calpains in cell culture including p53 (17Kubbutat M. Vousden K. Mol. Cell. Bio. 1997; 17: 460-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar), the Rb-like protein p107 (18Jang J. Lee S. Choi Y. Nguyen P. Lee J. Hwang S., Wu, M. Takano E. Maki M.

Nishizuka Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 4088-4092Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The requirement for calpain proteases in vivo has been illustrated by targeted deletion of the accessory subunit (capn4) that is required for activity of the ubiquitous calpain proteases. capn4-null mice die during mid-gestation, apparently because of severe defects in the cardiovascular system accompanied by accumulation of erythroid progenitor cells (20Arthur J.S. Elce J.S. Hegadorn C. Williams K. Greer P.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 4474-4481Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). These data emphasize that calpain proteases play a major role in cell growth and differentiation. Whereas calpains 1 and 2 are expressed in all tissues, calpain 3 is expressed at high levels in skeletal muscle and lens but is also found in various other tissues where its physiological substrates are unknown (21Sorimachi H. Sorimachi-Toyama N. Saido T. Kawasaki H. Sugita H. Miyasaka M. Arahata K. Ishiura S. Suzuki K. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10593-10605Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22Richard I.

Eye Res. 1998; 67: 221-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar).In this report, we present novel findings that implicate C/EBPα in regulating the expression and activity of calpain 3 in vivo. We have also identified a new physiological substrate for calpain 3, cyclin A. We present evidence that cleavage of cyclin A by calpain 3 occurs in myeloid precursor cells and reveals a new pathway involving the tightly controlled post-translational processing of cyclin A.DISCUSSIONIn this report, we describe a novel pathway for post-translational processing of cyclin A by calpain 3 in myeloid precursor cells. We have characterized the proteolysis of cyclin A and have found that of all mouse tissues tested it is restricted to tissues containing hematopoietic precursor cells, such as fetal and newborn liver and spleen and adult bone marrow. Cleaved cyclin A is also detectable in normal human myeloid precursor cells. Our data demonstrate that C/EBPα regulates this pathway because C/EBPα−/− mice are lacking the protease activity and detectable calpain 3 mRNA and protein. The absence of the protease is not simply due to the absence of mature granulocytes in these mice, since C/EBPε−/− mice, which have defects at the latest stage of granulocyte differentiation, retain calpain 3 activity (data not shown). It is unknown whether the regulation of calpain 3 by C/EBPα is caused by direct regulation of transcription, but it is probable that another factor cooperates with C/EBPα to regulate the protease in these cells because non-myeloid tissues that contain high levels of C/EBPα, such as adult liver and adipose tissue, do not contain the calpain 3 activity that cleaves cyclin A.Calpain 3 is expressed mainly in skeletal muscle (21Sorimachi H.

However, mutation of calpain 3 in humans has not been shown to result in any abnormal hematopoietic phenotype. Several splice variants of calpain 3 have been described, some of which affect the stability of the protease (35Ono Y. Shimada H. Sormachi H. Richard I. Takaomi S. Beckmann J. Ishiura S. Suzuki K. J.

Ophthamol. Vis. Sci. 1998; 39: 454PubMed Google Scholar). In this report, we have shown that at least one splice variant of calpain 3 (Δex6,15,16) can specifically cleave cyclin A. It is interesting to note that mouse skeletal muscle, which produces mainly the full-length highly unstable form of calpain 3 (21Sorimachi H. Sorimachi-Toyama N. Saido T. Kawasaki H. Sugita H. Miyasaka M. Arahata K. Ishiura S. Suzuki K. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10593-10605Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), does not contain detectable proteolytic activity toward cyclin A (data not shown). Further investigations with respect to alternative splicing and/or alternative promoter usage of calpain 3 during myeloid differentiation will reveal the relationship between C/EBPα and calpain 3 expression. Although calpain 3 clearly cleaves cyclin A in myeloid cells, many new calpain family members have been identified that have not yet been characterized with respect to protein expression or proteolytic activity (39Sorimachi H. Suzuki K. J. Biochem. 2001; 129: 653-664Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). At this time, we cannot rule out that one or more of the novel calpains may also cleave cyclin A, although no cleavage is detected in newborn livers in the absence of C/EBPα. Importantly, lack of calpain 3-mediated cyclin A cleavage does not appear to be compensated by calpains 1 and 2 in vivo because the activity of calpain 1 is elevated in newborn livers of C/EBPα−/− mice, and the activity of calpain 2 is unchanged. These data strongly suggest that calpain proteases have distinct substrate specificities in vivo.The calpain system is involved in cleavage of another cyclin protein in Alzheimer’s disease in which an undetermined calpain cleaves the cyclin-like protein p35, which is the activator of cdk5 in the brain (40Lee M.S. Kwon Y.T., Li, M. Peng J. Friedlander R.M. Tsai L.H. Nature. 2000; 405: 360-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (901) Google Scholar, 41Patrick G.N. Zukerberg L. Nikolic M. de la Monte S. Dikkes P. Tsai L.H. Nature. 1999; 402: 615-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (1307) Google Scholar). These data provide a precedent for calpain-mediated cleavage of a cyclin protein, resulting in altered cyclin-dependent protein kinase activity during a disease state. During preparation of this manuscript, Kaufmann et al. (42Kaufmann H. Marone R. Olayioye M.A. Bailey J.E. Fussenegger M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 29987-29993Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar) reported that cyclin A can be cleaved in CHO-K1 cells in a density-dependent manner. Cleavage of cyclin A in these cells resulted in a 55-kDa cleavage product that is located in the cytoplasm, where its function is unknown (42Kaufmann H. Marone R. Olayioye M.A. Bailey J.E. Fussenegger M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 29987-29993Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). The data presented here reveal a new proteolytic pathway in which calpain-mediated cleavage of cyclin A yields an ∼38-kDa product that is found in the nucleus and is able to bind and form active complexes with cdk2.Determining whether activation of calpain 3 and subsequent cleavage of cyclin A contributes to self-renewal and/or differentiation of myeloid precursor cells are important future goals. We hypothesize that calpain 3-mediated cleavage of cyclin A is required in dividing progenitor cells for the onset of differentiation and that lack of this activity in C/EBPα−/− mice might contribute to the block in myeloid differentiation in these mice. This hypothesis is consistent with recent studies in Drosophila in which physiological levels of N-terminally truncated mutants of cyclin A triggered epidermal cells to undergo an additional aberrant round of S phase and mitosis before exiting the cell cycle (43Jacobs H.W. Keidel E. Lehner C.F. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 2376-2386Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). We have found a correlation between cleavage of cyclin A and myeloid cell differentiation in cell culture studies as well. Examination of cyclin A cleavage in a human promyelocytic cell line (U937 cells) shows that calpain 3 activity and truncated cyclin A are present in undifferentiated myeloid precursor cells. Interestingly, the calpain activity is associated with cycling cells entering G2/M, and cleavage of cyclin A decreases during retinoic acid-induced myeloid differentiation, concomitant with growth arrest. 4A. Welm and G. Darlington, unpublished results. So far, we have been unsuccessful with studies of truncated cyclin A in mammalian cells because overexpression of N-terminally truncated forms of cyclin A result in mitotic arrest (43Jacobs H.W. Keidel E. Lehner C.F. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 2376-2386Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). A tightly regulated system that can be induced to express low levels of the protein will be required to study the role of truncated cyclin A in myeloid cell differentiation. These experiments will be crucial to determine whether there is a direct link between the requirement for C/EBPα in myeloid differentiation and the role of C/EBPα in regulating cleavage of cyclin A by calpain 3. Several transcription factors are master regulators of hematopoiesis, regulating the development of multi-potential precursor cells into terminally differentiated blood cells. In myeloid differentiation, several transcription factors, including PU.1, AML1, c-Myb, retinoic acid receptor α, and the CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein (C/EBP)1 family, have been shown to be key players (for review see Refs. 1Shivdasani R. Orkin S. Blood. 1996; 87: 4025-4039Crossref PubMed Google Scholar and 2Tenen D. Hromas R. Licht J. Zhang D. Blood. 1997; 90: 489-519Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The C/EBPs are transcription factors belonging to the bZIP subgroup, which is characterized by the presence of a basic region involved in DNA binding and a leucine zipper region that mediates homo- and heterodimerization between family members (for review see Ref. 3Lekstrom-Himes J. Xanthopoulos K.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28545-28548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (684) Google Scholar). Gene targeting studies in mice have revealed an essential role for several of these proteins in the development of specific blood cell lineages. C/EBPβ-deficient mice have defects in expansion of B lymphocytes (4Chen X. Liu W. Ambrosino C. Ruocco M.R. Poli V. Romani L. Quinto I. Barbieri S. Holmes K.L. Venuta S. Scala G. Blood. 1997; 90: 156-164PubMed Google Scholar) and produce dysfunctional monocytes, but they have normal granulocytes (5Screpanti I. Romani L. Musiani P. Modesti A. Fattori E. Lazzaro D. Sellitto C. Scarpa S. Bellavia D. Lattanzio G. Bistoni F. Frati L. Cortese R. Gulino A. Ciliberto G. Costantini F. Poli V. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1932-1941Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar). C/EBPα-deficient mice are blocked in granulocyte development at a very early stage; however, all other blood lineages, including blood monocytes and tissue macrophages, are normal (6Zhang D.E. Zhang P. Wang N.D. Hetherington C.J. Darlington G.J. Tenen D.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 569-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (750) Google Scholar). C/EBPε-deficient mice are blocked at the last stage of neutrophil maturation, placing C/EBPε downstream of C/EBPα in regulation of myeloid differentiation (7Yamanaka R. Barlow C. Lekstrom-Himes J. Castilla L. Liu P. Eckhaus M. Decker T. Wynshaw-Boris A. Xanthopoulos K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 99: 13187-13192Crossref Scopus (302) Google Scholar). Despite the fact that C/EBPα is required for myeloid differentiationin vivo, its precise role in these cells is not clear. C/EBPα is sufficient for granulocyte differentiation, and forced expression of C/EBPα after the initiation of monocyte differentiation redirects the cells to become granulocytes (8Radomska H.S. Huettner C.S. Zhang P. Cheng T. Scadden D.T. Tenen D.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 4301-4314Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar, 9Wang X. Scott E. Sawyers C.L. Friedman A.D. Blood. 1999; 94: 560-571Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). C/EBPα has been shown to regulate expression of several myeloid genes including granulocyte-colony stimulating factor receptor (G-CSFR) (6Zhang D.E. Zhang P. Wang N.D. Hetherington C.J. Darlington G.J. Tenen D.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 569-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (750) Google Scholar), myeloperoxidase (10Ford A.M. Bennett C.A. Healy L.E. Towatari M. Greaves M.F. Enver T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 10838-10843Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar), and neutrophil elastase (11Oelgeschlager M. Nuchprayoon I. Luscher B. Friedman A.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4717-4725Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar) in vivo. The lack of G-CSFR in C/EBPα knockout mice may partially account for the lack of granulocyte differentiation in these mice; however, both G-CSF- and G-CSFR-deficient mice retain the ability to produce granulocytes, albeit at a reduced number (12Lieschke G.J. Grail D. Hodgson G. Metcalf D. Stanley E. Cheers C. Fowler K.J. Basu S. Zhan Y.F. Dunn A.R. Blood. 1994; 84: 1737-1746Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 13Semerad C.L. Poursine-Laurent J. Liu F. Link D.C. Immunity. 1999; 11: 153-161Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). In contrast, the C/EBPα knockout animals are completely lacking granulocytes, suggesting that C/EBPα regulates additional genes that are required for granulopoiesis. The block in differentiation of myeloid precursors and the accumulation of myeloblasts in fetal livers and peripheral blood of C/EBPα−/− mice is similar to that found in acute myelogenous leukemia (AML). The importance of C/EBPα in AML is heightened with recent findings that C/EBPα is mutated in a significant number of AML patients (M2 subtype) that have no known karyotype abnormalities (14Pabst T. Mueller B.U. Zhang P. Radomska H.S. Narravula S. Schnittger S. Behre G. Hiddemann W. Tenen D.G. Nat. Genet. 2001; 27: 263-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (735) Google Scholar) and that down-regulation of C/EBPα occurs in t(8;21) myeloid leukemia by the AML1-ETO fusion protein (15Pabst T. Mueller B.U. Harakawa N. Schoch C. Haferlach T. Behre G. Hiddemann W. Zhang D.E. Tenen D.G. Nat. Med. 2001; 7: 444-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar). These studies, as well as studies in C/EBPα−/− mice, indicate that C/EBPα is a master regulator of myelopoiesis. Understanding key targets of C/EBPα that are involved in myelopoiesis is an important step in beginning to discern the mechanisms involved in normal myeloid cell differentiation and in the development of AML. Calpains are a family of intracellular cysteine proteases that are generally calcium-dependent and are involved in a variety of cell functions including signal transduction, cell division, cell differentiation, and apoptosis (for review see Ref. 16Sorimachi H. Ishiura S. Suzuki K. Biochem. J. 1997; 328: 721-732Crossref PubMed Scopus (618) Google Scholar). The substrates for calpains in vivo are not well defined; however, several molecules with regulatory functions have been reported to be substrates for calpains in cell culture including p53 (17Kubbutat M. Vousden K. Mol. Cell. Bio. 1997; 17: 460-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar), the Rb-like protein p107 (18Jang J. Lee S. Choi Y. Nguyen P. Lee J. Hwang S., Wu, M. Takano E. Maki M. Henkart P. Trepel J. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 1789-1796Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), and protein kinase C (19Kishimoto A. Mikawa K. Hashimoto K. Yasuda I. Tanaka S. Tominaga M. Kuroda T. Nishizuka Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 4088-4092Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The requirement for calpain proteases in vivo has been illustrated by targeted deletion of the accessory subunit (capn4) that is required for activity of the ubiquitous calpain proteases. capn4-null mice die during mid-gestation, apparently because of severe defects in the cardiovascular system accompanied by accumulation of erythroid progenitor cells (20Arthur J.S. Elce J.S. Hegadorn C. Williams K. Greer P.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 4474-4481Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). These data emphasize that calpain proteases play a major role in cell growth and differentiation. Whereas calpains 1 and 2 are expressed in all tissues, calpain 3 is expressed at high levels in skeletal muscle and lens but is also found in various other tissues where its physiological substrates are unknown (21Sorimachi H. Sorimachi-Toyama N. Saido T. Kawasaki H. Sugita H. Miyasaka M. Arahata K. Ishiura S. Suzuki K. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10593-10605Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22Richard I.

Eye Res. 1998; 67: 221-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). In this report, we present novel findings that implicate C/EBPα in regulating the expression and activity of calpain 3 in vivo. We have also identified a new physiological substrate for calpain 3, cyclin A. We present evidence that cleavage of cyclin A by calpain 3 occurs in myeloid precursor cells and reveals a new pathway involving the tightly controlled post-translational processing of cyclin A. DISCUSSIONIn this report, we describe a novel pathway for post-translational processing of cyclin A by calpain 3 in myeloid precursor cells. We have characterized the proteolysis of cyclin A and have found that of all mouse tissues tested it is restricted to tissues containing hematopoietic precursor cells, such as fetal and newborn liver and spleen and adult bone marrow. Cleaved cyclin A is also detectable in normal human myeloid precursor cells. Our data demonstrate that C/EBPα regulates this pathway because C/EBPα−/− mice are lacking the protease activity and detectable calpain 3 mRNA and protein. The absence of the protease is not simply due to the absence of mature granulocytes in these mice, since C/EBPε−/− mice, which have defects at the latest stage of granulocyte differentiation, retain calpain 3 activity (data not shown). It is unknown whether the regulation of calpain 3 by C/EBPα is caused by direct regulation of transcription, but it is probable that another factor cooperates with C/EBPα to regulate the protease in these cells because non-myeloid tissues that contain high levels of C/EBPα, such as adult liver and adipose tissue, do not contain the calpain 3 activity that cleaves cyclin A.Calpain 3 is expressed mainly in skeletal muscle (21Sorimachi H. Sorimachi-Toyama N. Saido T. Kawasaki H. Sugita H. Miyasaka M. Arahata K. Ishiura S. Suzuki K. J. Biol.

These data strongly suggest that calpain proteases have distinct substrate specificities in vivo. The calpain system is involved in cleavage of another cyclin protein in Alzheimer’s disease in which an undetermined calpain cleaves the cyclin-like protein p35, which is the activator of cdk5 in the brain (40Lee M.S. Kwon Y.T., Li, M. Peng J. Friedlander R.M. Tsai L.H. Nature. 2000; 405: 360-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (901) Google Scholar, 41Patrick G.N. Zukerberg L. Nikolic M. de la Monte S. Dikkes P. Tsai L.H. Nature. 1999; 402: 615-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (1307) Google Scholar). These data provide a precedent for calpain-mediated cleavage of a cyclin protein, resulting in altered cyclin-dependent protein kinase activity during a disease state. During preparation of this manuscript, Kaufmann et al. (42Kaufmann H. Marone R. Olayioye M.A. Bailey J.E. Fussenegger M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 29987-29993Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar) reported that cyclin A can be cleaved in CHO-K1 cells in a density-dependent manner. Cleavage of cyclin A in these cells resulted in a 55-kDa cleavage product that is located in the cytoplasm, where its function is unknown (42Kaufmann H. Marone R. Olayioye M.A. Bailey J.E. Fussenegger M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 29987-29993Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). The data presented here reveal a new proteolytic pathway in which calpain-mediated cleavage of cyclin A yields an ∼38-kDa product that is found in the nucleus and is able to bind and form active complexes with cdk2. Determining whether activation of calpain 3 and subsequent cleavage of cyclin A contributes to self-renewal and/or differentiation of myeloid precursor cells are important future goals. We hypothesize that calpain 3-mediated cleavage of cyclin A is required in dividing progenitor cells for the onset of differentiation and that lack of this activity in C/EBPα−/− mice might contribute to the block in myeloid differentiation in these mice. This hypothesis is consistent with recent studies in Drosophila in which physiological levels of N-terminally truncated mutants of cyclin A triggered epidermal cells to undergo an additional aberrant round of S phase and mitosis before exiting the cell cycle (43Jacobs H.W. Keidel E. Lehner C.F. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 2376-2386Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). We have found a correlation between cleavage of cyclin A and myeloid cell differentiation in cell culture studies as well. Examination of cyclin A cleavage in a human promyelocytic cell line (U937 cells) shows that calpain 3 activity and truncated cyclin A are present in undifferentiated myeloid precursor cells. Interestingly, the calpain activity is associated with cycling cells entering G2/M, and cleavage of cyclin A decreases during retinoic acid-induced myeloid differentiation, concomitant with growth arrest. 4A. Welm and G. Darlington, unpublished results. So far, we have been unsuccessful with studies of truncated cyclin A in mammalian cells because overexpression of N-terminally truncated forms of cyclin A result in mitotic arrest (43Jacobs H.W. Keidel E. Lehner C.F. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 2376-2386Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). A tightly regulated system that can be induced to express low levels of the protein will be required to study the role of truncated cyclin A in myeloid cell differentiation. These experiments will be crucial to determine whether there is a direct link between the requirement for C/EBPα in myeloid differentiation and the role of C/EBPα in regulating cleavage of cyclin A by calpain 3.

However, little is known about the direct binding of NADH to cytochrome. Here, we report that oxidized pyridine nucleotides (NAD+ and NADP+) and an analogue induce a spectral perturbation in bound heme when mixed with P450nor. The P450nor isoforms are classified according to electron donor specificity for NADH or NADPH. One type (Fnor, a P450nor of Fusarium oxysporum) utilizes only NADH. We found that NAD+induced a type I spectral change in Fnor, whereas NADP+induced a reverse type I spectral change, although theKd values for both were comparable. In contrast, NADP+ as well as NAD+ caused a type I spectral change in Tnor, a P450nor isozyme from Trichosporon cutaneum that utilizes both NADH and NADPH as electron donors. The B′ helix region of Tnor (73SAGGKAAA80) contains some Ala and Gly residues, whereas the sequence is replaced at a few sites with more bulky amino acid residues in Fnor (73SASGKQAA80). A single mutation (S75G) significantly improved the NADPH- dependent Nor activity of Fnor, and the overall activity was accelerated via the NADPH-enhanced reduction step. These results showed that pyridine nucleotide cofactors can bind P450nor and that only a few residues in the B′ helix region determine cofactor specificity. We further showed that a poor electron donor (NADPH) could also bind Fnor, but an appropriate configuration for electron transfer is blocked by steric hindrance mainly by Ser75 against the 2′-phosphate moiety.

Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 266: 690-698Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). P450s are widespread in eukaryotic and prokaryotic organisms, having attained unparalleled functional and molecular diversity during evolution (2Nelson D.R. Waterman M.R. Gotoh O. Coon M.J.

The P450 superfamily consists of about 200 known families that have been classified according to amino acid sequence data (2Nelson D.R. Waterman M.R. Gotoh O. Coon M.J. Estabrook R.W. Gunsalus I.C.

Kodansha, Tokyo1993: 1-15Google Scholar). P450 enzymes usually function as monooxygenases, but many catalyze other reactions such as reduction, isomerization, and dehydration (5Sono M. Roach M.P. Coulter E.D. Dawson J.H. Chem. Rev. 1996; 96: 2841-2887Crossref PubMed Scopus (2125) Google Scholar). Nitric oxide reductase (Nor) cytochrome P450nor (P450nor) is involved in fungal denitrification (6Nakahara K. Tanimoto T. Hatano K. Usuda K. Shoun H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8350-8355Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This enzyme is the most functionally diverse among known P450 enzymes as it catalyzes the reaction shown in Reaction 1 without a redox partner such as P450 reductase and thus receives electrons directly from NADH or NADPH (NAD(P)H). The catalytic turnover is over 30,000 min−1 at 30 °C (7Shiro Y. Fujii M. Iizuka T. Adachi S. Tsukamoto K. Nakahara K. Shoun H. J. Biol.

Biochem. 2001; 268: 3198-3204Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Recent progress in genome analyses has further revealed that P450nor and thus denitrification is generally distributed among fungi. The Fnor species has been extensively analyzed both physicochemically and kinetically, and the structure has been determined by x-ray crystallography (16Park S.Y. Shimizu H. Adachi S. Nakagawa A. Tanaka I. Nakahara K. Shoun H. Obayashi E. Nakamura H. Iizuka T. Shiro Y. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 10: 827-832Crossref Scopus (181) Google Scholar). These P450nor isoforms are specific for the electron donors, NADH and NADPH. Fnor and Cnor1 are specific to NADH (6Nakahara K. Tanimoto T. Hatano K. Usuda K. Shoun H. J. Biol.

Microbiol. 1995; 61: 883-889Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The P450 superfamily has attained vast diversity by rapidly changing the substrate recognition sites (SRSs) of its many forms (3Gotoh O. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 83-90Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Each P450 species has adapted as the result of molecular evolution to a specific substrate. In contrast to other P450s that catalyze the monooxygenase reaction against an organic substrate, the substrate of P450nor is NO (an inorganic gas). Since P450nor interacts directly with NAD(P)H, the enzyme seems to have evolved to fit this electron donor instead of the organic substrate of the monooxygenase reaction. The crystal structure (16Park S.Y. Shimizu H. Adachi S. Nakagawa A. Tanaka I. Nakahara K. Shoun H. Obayashi E. Nakamura H. Iizuka T. Shiro Y. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 10: 827-832Crossref Scopus (181) Google Scholar) revealed a unique configuration of P450nor despite its overall structural similarity to other P450s, such as P450cam (17Poulos T.L. Finzel B.C. Howard A.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1987; 195: 687-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (1296) Google Scholar) and P450BM-3 (18Ravichandran K.G. Boddupalli S.S. Hasermann C.A. Peterson J.A. Deisenhofer J. Science. 1993; 261: 731-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (912) Google Scholar). The B′ helix and the loop between F- and G-helices (F, G-loop) form an entrance to the heme-distal pocket. The F, G-loop rises toward the outside to form a wide entrance and a large cavity inside the distal pocket. In addition, positive charges due to Arg and Lys residues are abnormally concentrated outside and inside the heme-distal pocket. We supposed that these structural features are associated with the direct NAD(P)H interaction and showed that the positive charge cluster functions in attracting negatively charged NAD(P)H (19Kudo T. Takaya N. Park S.Y. Shiro Y. Shoun H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 5020-5026Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). SRS-1 that contains a B′ helix is the most structurally variable among P450 species (20Hasermann C.A. Ravichandran K.G. Peterson J.A. Deisenhofer J. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 236: 1169-1185Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar, 21Cupp-Vickery J.R. Poulos T.L. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 144-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar). Thus, the B′ helix of P450nor may also play an important role in direct interaction with NAD(P)H. However, direct evidence has yet to show that NAD(P)H forms a reversible complex with P450nor prior to transferring electrons to the bound heme. Here, we constructed various mutant proteins of P450nor based on the B′ helix sequence and found evidence of a key role for the B′ helix in determining specificity for NAD(P)H along with the direct binding of NAD(P) analogues to wild type and mutant P450nor proteins. Plasmids were constructed, enzymatically modified, and electrophoretically resolved as described (22Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd. ed.

Primers M13–47 and M13-RV (Takara, Otsu, Japan) were specific for pUC18. The following lists the mutants and primers used in this study (mutated sites are underlined): 3A, GAGCTTAGCGCCGCTGCAGCCAAGGCAAA; SG, CTTAGCGCCGGTGGAAAGCAAGCA; NG, TTCCCTGAGCTTAACGCCGGTGGAAAG; GS, TTCCCTGAGCTTGGCGCCAGTGGAAAG; NS, TTCCCTGAGCTTAACGCCAGTGGAAAG; GG, TTCCCTGAGCTTGGCGCCGGTGGAAAG; S73A, TTCCCTGAGCTTGCCGCCAGTGGAAAG; S75A, CTTAGCGCCGCTGGAAAGCAAGCA; G76A, AGCGCCAGTGCAAAGCAAGCAGCC; K77A, AGCGCCAGTGGAGCGCAAGCAGCCAAGGC; Q78A, AGTGGAAAGGCAGCAGCCAAGGC. PCR (30 cycles) proceeded as follows: 1 min for 94 °C, 2 min for 55 °C, and 2 min for 72 °C. After digestion withBssHII and BglII, 1.1-kb fragments were purified and replaced with the corresponding portion of pT7nor. The introduced mutation was confirmed by sequencing the full length of the exchanged cDNA. The DNAs of pT7nor and its derivatives were individually introduced into Escherichia coli JM109 (DE3). The transformed cells were precultured overnight at 37 °C in 20 ml of LA broth (1% tryptone, 0.5% yeast extract, 0.5% NaCl, 25 μg/ml ampicillin) supplemented with 0.5% glucose. Transformant precultures were transferred to 2 liters of LA broth in 5-liter Erlenmeyer flasks, shaken for 5–6 h, and further shaken at 120 rpm overnight at 30 °C in the presence of 1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactoside. The transformed cells were harvested, suspended in 10 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.0, containing 0.1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm EDTA, and 10% (v/v) glycerol) containing 0.1 mmphenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride and tosylphenylalanyl chloromethyl ketone, and disrupted twice using a French pressure cell press (Sim-Aminco) at 20,000 p.s.i. The suspension was centrifuged at 1,500 × g for 30 min to remove cell debris and then centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 1 h. The resulting supernatant was dialyzed overnight against Tris buffer. A DEAE-cellulose (Whatman DE52) column was equilibrated with Tris buffer, and then the dialysate was charged and eluted with a 0–0.4m KCl gradient. Fractions containing P450nor were collected and dialyzed against Tris buffer. The P450nor fraction was further purified by chromatography through either Mono Q HR 5/5 or Resource Q columns (Amersham Biosciences) in the same manner as described above for DEAE. The absorbance ratio of mutant proteins purified in this manner was over 1.6 at 413 nm as compared with that at 280 nm. This purified sample was used for further experiments. We investigated NAD analogue binding to P450nor using NAD(P)H and the following NAD(P) analogues (all from Sigma): 3-aminopyridine adenine dinucleotide phosphate; ADP; 2′-AMP; 5′-AMP; 3-acetylpyridine adenine dinucleotide; β-NAD+; β-NADP+; nicotinamide hypoxanthine dinucleotide and the reduced form; β-nicotinamide mononucleotide; 3-pyridinealdehyde adenine dinucleotide (PAAD); thionicotinamide adenine dinucleotide and its reduced form. The NAD(P) analogues that caused a spectral change in P450nor were further analyzed by spectrophotometric titration using a Beckman DU 7500 spectrophotometer. The dissociation constant (Kd) was calculated from the difference in absorbance (ΔA) at 413 nm from that at 395 nm. P450nor (5 μm) in 50 mm TES buffer at pH 7.2 was mixed with an equal volume (100 μl) of each substrate analogue (dissolved in the same buffer), and the spectrum of the mixture (200-μl volume) was recorded. We analyzed the P450nor reducing half-reaction by following the appearance of the intermediate (I) at 444 nm upon reduction of the Fe3+-NO complex with NAD(P)H (Reaction 3) at 10 °C using a Unisoku rapid scan analyzer (Osaka, Japan) as reported (7Shiro Y. Fujii M. Iizuka T. Adachi S. Tsukamoto K. Nakahara K. Shoun H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1617-1623Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar) where 50 mmTES buffer (pH 7.2) was used instead of phosphate buffer or Tris-HCl buffer to eliminate the effects of anions on the Nor activity (19Kudo T. Takaya N. Park S.Y. Shiro Y. Shoun H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 5020-5026Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). P450nor enzyme (final concentration, 5 μm) in Fe3+-NO was mixed with an equal volume of NADH or NADPH (final concentration, 20 μm) anaerobically, and the spectral changes were recorded. The gate time was set to 1 ms, and the rate of I formation (kobs) was calculated as described (7Shiro Y. Fujii M. Iizuka T. Adachi S. Tsukamoto K. Nakahara K. Shoun H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1617-1623Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). We assayed the Nor activity of P450nor as reported (6Nakahara K. Tanimoto T. Hatano K. Usuda K. Shoun H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8350-8355Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). P450nor (4 nm) was anaerobically incubated with 110 μm NO in the presence of 1.0 mmNADH, and the amount of N2O produced was determined by gas chromatography. The content of high spin heme at the resting state of the enzyme was estimated from the ratio of the absorbance of the high spin form (390 nm) to that of the low spin form (414 nm) as described (24Okamoto N. Imai Y. Shoun H. Shiro Y. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 8839-8847Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The P450nor concentration was spectrophotometrically determined from the CO-difference spectrum as reported (25Omura T. Sato R. J. Biol. Chem. 1964; 239: 2379-2385Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) using an extinction coefficient of 86.3 mm−1cm−1 for the difference in absorbance between 448 and 490 nm (6Nakahara K. Tanimoto T. Hatano K. Usuda K. Shoun H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8350-8355Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). NADH was determined from the absorbance at 340 nm using a molar absorption coefficient of 6.22 mm−1cm−1. We constructed mutant proteins of Fnor in which the amino acid residues of the B′ helix (74ASGKQA79) and its neighboring residue (Ser73) were replaced or deleted, respectively (Fig.1, bottom). The absorption spectra of all mutant proteins produced in heterologous E. coli cells were the same as those of the native protein in the ferric (Fe3+) or the CO-bound (Fe2+-CO) form (data not shown). The bound heme in the native purified protein is in a Fe3+ form that is in equilibrium between the high and low spin states. The ratio of the high spin state of wild type P450nor is 58% in 50 mm TES buffer (pH 7.2). The ratio of the spin states of mutant proteins was similar (54–59% high spin). These results indicate that the mutant proteins were adequately folded and that the fine structure at the active site was maintained. The B′ helix should be destroyed in mutant 3A in which the sequence 75SGK77 was deleted and Gln78 was replaced with Ala. This mutation resulted in a decline of NADH-dependent Nor activity to the same level as the NADPH-dependent activity of wild type Fnor (Fig.2). Other single mutations in which individual residues were replaced with Ala (S73A, S75A, G76A, K77A, and Q78A) decreased the NADH-dependent activity to various degrees (Fig. 2). Among them, the activity of G76A mostly decreased to 40%, confirming the importance of the smallest residue (Gly) at this position (26Takaya N. Kudo T. Shoun H. Ishimura Y. Shimada H. Suematsu M. Oxygen Homeostasis and Its Dynamics. Springer-Verlag, Tokyo1998: 156-160Google Scholar). These mutagenesis results showed that the B′ helix plays an important role in conferring full Nor activity upon P450nor. Tnor and Cnor2, which can utilize both NADH and NADPH or prefer NADPH to NADH, contain many Ala and Gly residues in the region73SAGGKAAA80 (Fig. 1, top). The only bulky residue (Lys77) is oriented toward the opposite side so that the entrance is clear (16Park S.Y. Shimizu H. Adachi S. Nakagawa A. Tanaka I. Nakahara K. Shoun H. Obayashi E. Nakamura H. Iizuka T. Shiro Y. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 10: 827-832Crossref Scopus (181) Google Scholar, 19Kudo T. Takaya N. Park S.Y. Shiro Y. Shoun H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 5020-5026Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The A/G-rich sequence is replaced at sites 73, 75, and/or 78 with bulky residues in Fnor and Cnor1 that can utilize only NADH. These facts suggest that the substitution of a few residues in this region is responsible for determining electron donor specificity. The NADPH-dependent activity of the mutant Q78A was slightly improved, although the NADH-dependent activity decreased to some extent (to 75% of the wild type) (Fig. 2). This suggests that position 78 is important for NADH interaction but not for determining specificity. We therefore focused upon positions 73 and 75 in subsequent investigations (Fig.1). Among several mutants of Fnor, the results from SG (S75G) and GG (S73G/S75G) are notable. Fig. 3 shows that these mutations significantly improved NADPH-dependent Nor activity without affecting, or even slightly increasing, the NADH-dependent activity. These results indicate that position 75 must be Gly for NADPH to be an effective electron donor of Nor activity as observed in wild type Cnor2 or Tnor. Cnor1 also conserves Gly75, but NADPH-dependent Nor activity is very low. However, Asn with a bulky residue replaces the Ser73 in Fnor. The double mutation (NG) that confers the same sequence as Cnor1 did not modulate either the NADH- or the NADPH-dependent activities (Fig. 3), consistent with the specificity of wild type Cnor1. By contrast, the single mutation that replaced Ser73 with Gly (GS mutant) or with a bigger residue (NS mutant) decreased NADH-dependent activity without improving that dependent on NADPH. Thus, the size of the residues at positions 73 and 75 cooperatively determines specificity for NAD(P)H. The mutations at Ser73and/or Ser75 in Fnor modulate the interaction with NAD(P)H as well as the overall Nor activity. This process (Reaction 3) can be observed as an isolated reaction by rapid scan analysis (7Shiro Y. Fujii M. Iizuka T. Adachi S. Tsukamoto K. Nakahara K. Shoun H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1617-1623Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Accumulation of the intermediate (I) upon reduction of the ferric enzyme-NO complex (Fe3+-NO) with NADH (7Shiro Y. Fujii M. Iizuka T. Adachi S. Tsukamoto K. Nakahara K. Shoun H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1617-1623Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar) is detectable under controlled conditions (Fig.4C). This intermediate cannot be detected when NADPH is used instead of NADH as the electron donor as in wild type Fnor (Fig. 4D). This is possibly because the reduction (I formation) is slower than the decomposition ofI (7, 19). However, I accumulated upon reduction with NADPH as well as with NADH in the SG (Fig. 4, A andB) or GG (data not shown) mutants, showing that the rate of reduction with NADPH was enhanced by the mutations. These results are consistent with the finding that overall activity was enhanced by the mutations (Fig. 3). The apparent rate constant for the reduction at a fixed NADH (or NADPH) concentration (kobs) was obtained with each mutant from the time-dependent spectral change during Iformation (7Shiro Y. Fujii M. Iizuka T. Adachi S. Tsukamoto K. Nakahara K. Shoun H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1617-1623Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar) (Table I). The results demonstrated that the NADH- or NADPH-dependentkobs value for each enzyme species parallels the overall activity (Fig. 3). In other words, the overall Nor activity was modulated by each mutation via action against the reduction step.Table IKinetic properties (kobs) of intermediate (I) formation of F. oxysporum Fnor (WT) and its mutantsMean ± S.D. ofkobs1-aCalculated from three to five replicates.s−1SubstrateWT1-bWT, wild type.3ASGNGGSNSGGNADH35.1 ± 1.6ND56.2 ± 3.937.3 ± 1.017.1 ± 0.512.7 ± 0.535.6 ± 1.3NADPHNDND13.9 ± 0.4NDNDND25.5 ± 1.9ND, undetectable.1-a Calculated from three to five replicates.1-b WT, wild type.

Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 8839-8847Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). However, we have not detected spectral perturbation upon mixing P450nor and NADH. This may be because the powerful absorbance due to NADH overwhelms the minor spectral perturbation that would occur in the bound heme of P450nor. Here, we tested the specificity of various NADH analogues for P450nor binding as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Among these analogues, PAAD and NAD+ caused a type I spectral change in wild type Fnor (Fig. 5A). A spectral change is defined as an increase in absorbance around 390 nm due to high spin state heme accompanying a concomitant decrease in low spin heme (413 nm). On the contrary, NADP+ caused a reverse type I spectral change. The SG mutant also underwent a type I spectral perturbation by PAAD or NAD+ but to a greater extent than those caused in the wild type (Fig. 5B). However, NADP+ conferred little spectral change on the SG mutant. Mutant 3A was inert against PAAD and NAD+ but perturbed by NADP+ similarly to the wild type (Fig. 5C). NADP+ as well as PAAD and NAD+ induced a type I spectral change in Tnor that can utilize both NADH and NADPH as electron donors (Fig. 5D). Thus, these NADH analogues can bind to P450nor, whereas in the bound form, there would be two alternative states that cause either a type I or a reverse type I spectral change. The effects of these mutations in the B′ helix region also indicate that these analogues bind P450nor from the distal side. Arg64 and Arg174 are located beneath the B′ helix and the F,G-loop, respectively, and play a central role in the positive charge cluster to interact with NADH (19Kudo T. Takaya N. Park S.Y. Shiro Y. Shoun H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 5020-5026Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Our R64E and R174E mutants completely lose the ability to interact with NADH. We concluded from the results that Arg64 and Arg174 must play the central role in binding NADH by fixing the pyrophosphate moiety of NADH from both sides (19Kudo T. Takaya N. Park S.Y. Shiro Y. Shoun H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 5020-5026Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). In fact, neither PAAD, NAD+, nor NADP+ caused any spectral perturbation in these mutants (R64E and R174E; data not shown). These and previous results support the notion that P450nor forms a complex with NADH during the reduction step (Reaction 3). The spectral perturbation caused by NADH analogues (Fig. 5) reached saturation against ligand concentration (data not shown), suggesting that binding of each ligand to Fnor (wild type or SG mutant) is specific. The dissociation constant (Kd) of each Fnor-ligand complex was determined by spectrophotometric titration (Table II). The Kdvalues for PAAD and NAD+ were decreased by the SG mutation, whereas the SG mutant became spectrally inert against NADP+(Fig. 5).Table IITitration (Kd) of NAD(P) analogs and their half inhibition (I50) of intermediate (I) formation (kobs)LigandType of spectral changeI50 ofkobsKdWT2-aWT, wild type.SGWTSGNADHNADHNADPHmmmmmmAnaloguePAADI4.01.40.90.20.2NAD+I10.47.61.40.50.7NADP+Reverse I9.13.21.61.7Anion2-bRef. 19.Br−Reverse I10050Cl−Reverse I1001202-a WT, wild type.2-b Ref. 19Kudo T.

Open table in a new tab PAAD, NAD+, and NADP+ also inhibited the reduction step (Reaction 3) as well as the overall reaction of P450nor. We could not determine the kinetic constants of the reduction such as theKm value for NADH, the Vmaxvalue (kred; namely, kobsvalue at an infinite NADH concentration), 2kred indicates the first order rate constant for the reduction. and thus theKi value for the inhibitors because the reaction rate is too high even at 10 °C (19Kudo T. Takaya N. Park S.Y. Shiro Y. Shoun H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 5020-5026Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Instead, we determined the concentration of each analogue (I50) that yielded half-inhibition of the reduction with 20 μm NADH (Table II). The I50 value for each analogue was smaller than the corresponding Kd value with both wild type Fnor and its SG mutant, a finding that was in striking contrast to the results obtained using halogen ions (Br−and Cl−). Halogen ions are reverse type I ligands of P450nor that also inhibit the reduction process (19Kudo T. Takaya N. Park S.Y. Shiro Y. Shoun H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 5020-5026Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). TheKd and I50 values of halogen ions were comparable (Table II) (19Kudo T. Takaya N. Park S.Y. Shiro Y. Shoun H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 5020-5026Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The present results indicate that the B′ helix and the neighboring residue 73 play a key role in the interaction of P450nor with NAD(P)H. The A/G-rich sequence of Tnor/Cnor2 type P450nor evolves during the interaction with NADPH. The sequence was modulated at positions 73, 75, and/or 78 to restrict interaction with NADPH. The tertiary structure of Fnor around the entrance of the distal heme pocket displaying the side chains of Ser73 and Ser75 is shown in Fig.6. These side chains are oriented toward the entrance. It is thus highly likely that this side chain of Ser75 prevents NADPH from interacting properly with Fnor through steric hindrance of the 2′-phosphate moiety. Asn73in Cnor1 substitutes for Gly75 in causing steric hindrance. Position 75 must be Gly for NADPH to be an effective electron donor. Only a single mutation at this site (SG mutant) in Fnor remarkably increased the overall activity of NADPH (Fig. 3). In addition, modulation of the overall activity is in parallel with the altered reduction rate (Reaction 3) (Fig. 4 and Table I). This means that the overall activity improved by the SG or GG mutation arose from the enhanced NADPH- dependent reduction of the Fe3+-NO complex (Reaction 3). That NADP+ induced a reverse type I spectral change in wild type Fnor in contrast to the type I change caused by NAD+is notable (Fig. 5), although the Kd values for NAD+ and NADP+ were comparable (Table II). The results indicate that Fnor can bind NADPH with affinity comparable with that for NADH, but their configurational state in the bound form differs. In other words, the configurational state of NADPH bound to Fnor is not adequate for subsequent electron transfer. This notion is further supported by the finding that Tnor can utilize both NADH and NADPH and that NADP+ induced a type I spectral change like NAD+ (Fig. 5). Thus, the reverse type I spectral change appears to be caused by binding the analogue (NADP+ for Fnor) of the unfavorable electron donor. We propose that the SG mutation altered the configuration of NADPH bound to Fnor to improve the fit for subsequent electron transfer. The cofactor specificity of P450nor might be mainly determined only by the presence or absence of a small side chain of Ser75. This notion could be confirmed if the kred and Km values for NAD(P)H for the reduction step can be determined and compared between the wild type and SG mutant. However, the reduction is too rapid to determine the kinetic constants. That the I50 value was smaller than theKd value for each analogue with both the wild type and SG mutant of Fnor is also notable. The I50value should usually be comparable with or larger than theKi value (i.e. Kd) for an inhibitor, as seen with halogen ions (Table II). The results suggested two kinds of ligand (pyridine nucleotide) binding with different affinity. This notion assumes that high binding affinity does not cause spectral perturbation, but it can inhibit the reduction step, and the binding affinity corresponds to the I50value. Another mode of binding with a lower affinity causes spectral perturbation in the bound heme by which the Kdvalues were obtained. This assumption agrees with the small spectral changes caused by pyridine nucleotides (Fig. 5) since the population of the protein-ligand complex with lower affinity should be smaller. Dinucleotides such as pyridine nucleotide are symmetrical molecules with a 2-fold axis at the pyrophosphate moiety. Considering the importance of the Arg64 and Arg174 for cofactor binding along with the big gap in the distal heme pocket, cofactor binding in a reverse orientation would be possible. This means that a pyridine nucleotide molecule can penetrate the pocket with the adenine moiety as a head and the nicotinamide moiety as a tail. The nicotinamide moiety of oxidized pyridine nucleotide (NAD+and NADP+) is positively charged, so the positive charge cluster inside the heme pocket would repel this molecule. Thus, the P450nor-ligand complex should become more stable when NAD+or NADP+ binds in the reverse, instead of the normal direction. The big cavity as well as the hydrophilic environment of the distal heme pocket would allow bound pyridine nucleotide cofactors to assume several modes or configurations. We concluded that P450nor forms reversible complexes with the electron donor (NAD(P)H) before receiving electrons from it. Therefore, the mode of P450nor interaction should be compared with those of other enzymes that require pyridine nucleotide cofactors. An ionic interaction or repulsion is important for many NAD(P)-binding proteins to discriminate NADP from NAD. For example, the M. G.conserved Asp at the C terminus of the βαβ motif (Rossmann fold) in NAD-specific dehydrogenases impairs interaction with NADP by both ionic repulsion and steric hindrance against the 2′-phosphate moiety (27Rossmann M.G. Moras D. Olsen K.W. Nature. 1974; 250: 194-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (1170) Google Scholar, 28Wierenga R.K. Terpstra P. Hol W.G.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1986; 187: 101-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (996) Google Scholar). By contrast, NADP-specific dehydrogenases or hydroxylases alter cofactor specificity by replacing the negatively charged residue with a smaller and neutral residue and by arranging a positively charged residue in its neighbor to improve interaction with the 2′-phosphate moiety of NADP (29Nishiyama M. Birktoft J.J. Beppu T. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4656-4660Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 30Yayoi T. Miyazaki K. Oshima T. Komukai Y. Go M. J. Biochem. 1996; 119: 1014-1018Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). P450nor has only two types of cofactor specificity. One is specific to only NADH, and the other can utilize both NADH and NADPH. No isoform has yet been discovered that utilizes only NADPH as an electron donor. This seems reasonable when the manner in which P450nor discriminates NADH and NADPH is considered. A positive charge is not used to improve interaction with NADPH, but simply canceling steric hindrance caused by a few residues alters the specificity. Thus, the binding motif in P450nor for the cofactors, such as a large hydrophilic cavity (16Park S.Y. Shimizu H. Adachi S. Nakagawa A. Tanaka I. Nakahara K. Shoun H. Obayashi E. Nakamura H. Iizuka T.

Topoisomerases II have important functions in DNA replication and can serve as a cancer chemotherapy target. Indeed, drugs such as etoposide (VP-16) or mitoxantrone, form drug-topoisomerase II-DNA ternary complexes referred to as “cleavable complex.” The primary cytotoxic effect of these so-called “topoisomerase II inhibitors” is not by inhibition of topoisomerase II activity but rather by stabilizing topoisomerase II cleavable complexes. This interaction prevents the DNA-resealing step normally catalyzed by topoisomerase II. The ternary complex constitutes a latent DNA-damaging state, which is ultimately converted to an irreversible DNA double-strand break (DSB).1 Although the mechanism by which complex formation mediates cell death is still poorly understood, it has been largely documented with few exceptions that the amount of cleavable complexes and the subsequent number of DNA breaks correlates with cytotoxicity (1Davies S.M. Robson C.N. Davies S.L. Hickson I.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 17724-17729Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These observations suggest that abnormal intracellular distribution or a decrease in expression level, activity, and sensitivity of the inhibited topoisomerase may have major impacts on topoisomerase inhibitor clinical efficacy. This has been confirmed by the molecular characterization of the so-called atypical multidrug resistant phenotype (at-MDR) resulting from selection by topoisomerase II inhibitors. Indeed, at-MDR cells display cross-resistance to other topoisomerase II inhibitors and have been associated with a number of functional and/or structural topoisomerase II alterations, including decreased catalytic activity, abnormal interaction between topoisomerase II and nuclear matrix, reduced expression, point mutation and, finally, altered phosphorylation (2Beck W.T. Danks M.K. Wolverton J.S. Chen M. Granzen B. Kim R. Suttle D.P. Adv. Pharmacol. 1994; 29B: 145-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar).The role of phosphorylation on topoisomerase II function has been debated and remains controversial. Indeed, previous studies have shown that topoisomerase II contains potential serine phosphorylation sites and that this enzyme is a substrate for various serine kinases, including casein kinase II, p34cdc2 kinase, and classic protein kinase C (PKC). In a cell-free system, PKC-induced phosphorylation of topoisomerase II results in an increase in its catalytic activity by enhancing ATP hydrolysis (3Corbett A.H. DeVore R.F. Osheroff N. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 20513-20518Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 4Corbett A.H. Fernald A.W. Osheroff N. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 2090-2097Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). In the absence of antineoplastic drugs, phosphorylation has a negligible effect on other steps of topoisomerase II catalytic cycle, including DNA binding or DNA cleavage/religation equilibrium. However, in the presence of VP-16 or amsacrine, phosphorylation decreases the ability of drugs to stabilize DNA-topoisomerase II complexes, apparently by increasing the rates of religation of DNA by the enzyme (5DeVore R.F. Corbett A.H. Osheroff N. Cancer Res. 1992; 52: 2156-2161PubMed Google Scholar). Other studies have provided indirect evidences that PKC might also influence topoisomerase II function in vivo. For example, PKC inhibitors, such as suramin or staurosporine, decrease topoisomerase II phosphorylation and catalytic activity in intact cells as well as drug-induced topoisomerase II-mediated cleavage (6Zwelling L.A. Altschuler E. Mayes J. Hinds M. Chan D. Cancer Chemother. Pharmacol. 1991; 29: 48-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar, 7Funayama Y. Nishio K. Takeda Y. Kubota N. Ohira T. Ohmori T. Ohta S. Ogasawara H. Hasegawa S. Saijo N. Anticancer Res. 1993; 13: 1981-1988PubMed Google Scholar). However, the role of topoisomerase II phosphorylation in drug resistance has been minimized on the basis of independent studies that have shown that, in at-MDR cells, topoisomerase II could be either hyperphosphorylated or hypophosphorylated (8Takano H. Kohno K. Ono M. Uchida Y. Kuwano M. Cancer Res. 1991; 51: 3951-3957PubMed Google Scholar, 9Chen M. Wolverton J.S. Beck W.T. Proc. Am. Assoc. Cancer Res. 1992; 33: 2707Google Scholar, 10Ritke M.K.

Pharmacol. 1995; 48: 798-805PubMed Google Scholar).At least 12 different isoforms of PKC have been characterized so far and have been separated into three categories based on the Ca2+ requirement for activation and phorbol ester binding activity. Conventional PKCs (α, βI, βII, and γ) are Ca2+-dependent phorbol ester receptor kinases; novel PKCs (δ, ε, θ, and η) are Ca2+-independent phorbol ester receptor kinases; and atypical PKCs (ζ, ι, λ, and υ) are independent of both Ca2+ and phorbol ester. Previous studies have shown that topoisomerase II is phosphorylatedin vitro by each of the conventional PKC isoforms (11Wells N.J. Fry A.M. Guano F. Norbury C. Hickson I.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28357-28363Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). However, the influence of these PKC isozymes on cellular topoisomerase function in vivo is still largely unknown. Moreover, to the best of our knowledge, the influence of atypical PKC isozymes on topoisomerase II phosphorylation and function has not been investigated.PKC ζ is an atypical PKC isoform, which is activated directly or indirectly by a variety of important signaling molecules, including ceramide (12Lozano J.

Cell. 1993; 74: 555-563Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). PKC ζ has emerged as a critical regulator of a number of cellular functions, including proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis inhibition (18Moscat J. Sanz L. Sanchez P. Diaz-Meco M.T. Adv. Enzyme Reg. 2001; 41: 99-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Despite the critical role of this enzyme in cellular signaling, its implication in the regulation of topoisomerase II function has never been examined. This study was aimed to evaluate the effect of PKC ζ overexpression on the formation of cleavable complexes and cytotoxicity induced by VP-16 in the human leukemic U937 cells.DISCUSSIONThis study shows that PKCζ overexpression in U937 cells resulted in inhibition of apoptosis and increased survival of U937 cells treated with VP-16 and mitoxantrone, two topoisomerase II inhibitors. Enforced PKCζ expression resulted in a marked decrease in VP-16-induced DPC and DNA DSB, whereas the level of topoisomerase IIα and topoisomerase IIβ expression was unchanged compared with control cells. These results suggest that PKCζ can interfere with topoisomerase II function. In fact, we found that PKCζ-overexpressing cells exhibited reduced topoisomerase II catalytic function as measured by the decatenation assay. Altered topoisomerase II catalytic cycle may explain reduced drug-induced DNA damage and cytotoxicity. Thus, this study shows for the first time that a specific PKC isozyme may inhibit topoisomerase II catalytic activity and VP-16-induced apoptosis and cytotoxicity by interfering with drug-induced DNA damage.Based on the kinase function of PKCζ, we hypothesized that PKCζ overexpression might result in abnormal topoisomerase II phosphorylation. In fact, we found that, in PKCζ-overexpressing cells, PKCζ was not only found to interact with topoisomerase IIα and topoisomerase IIβ but also that these two topoisomerase II isoforms were heavily phosphorylated on serine residues. These results suggest that, in PKCζ-overexpressing cells, PKCζ not only directly or indirectly interacts with the two topoisomerase II isoforms but also phosphorylates these enzymes. However, using a cell-free system, we described that only topoisomerase IIβ is a substrate for PKCζ and that PKCζ inhibits topoisomerase IIβ activity. This result suggests that, in PKCζ-overexpressing cells, PKCζ interacts directly with topoisomerase IIβ and inhibits topoisomerase IIβ catalytic activity. This hypothesis is consistent with the role of this topoisomerase IIβ form in the cytotoxicity of topoisomerase II inhibitors (23Brown G.A. McPherson J.P., Gu, L. Hedley D.W. Toso R. Deuchars K.L.

Moreover, the fact that, in PKCζ-overexpressing cells, topoisomerase IIα was found to be constitutively phosphorylated whereas, in vitro, PKCζ was unable to phosphorylate this enzyme, suggests that topoisomerase IIα is phosphorylated by another PKCζ-regulated kinase. In this perspective, it is interesting to note that in a recent study topoisomerase IIα was found to be phosphorylated in intact cells by ERK2, the effector serine kinase of the classic MAPK module (25Shapiro P.S. Whalen A.M. Tolwinski N.S. Wilsbacher J. Froelich-Ammon S.J. Garcia M. Osheroff N. Ahn N.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 3551-3560Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Based on previous studies, which have documented that PKCζ is a downstream target of MAPK (26Berra E. Diaz-Meco M.T. Lozano J. Frutos S. Municio M.M. Sanchez P. Sanz L. Moscat J.

The fact that, in these cells, ERK2 was found to be constitutively activated and accumulated in the nucleus (data not shown) supports this hypothesis.The role of atypical PKC isoforms, including PKCζ, in cell survival has been previously documented. Indeed, it has been described that the blockade of PKCζ or PKCλ/ι with dominant-negative mutants or antisense oligonucleotides is sufficient to promote apoptosis (28Diaz-Meco M.T. Municio M.M.

Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 4245-4251Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) strengthens the role of PKCζ in the cellular protection against genotoxic stress. The mechanism by which atypical PKC isoforms exert their anti-apoptotic effect has received a great deal of attention. These studies strongly suggested that NF-κB signaling pathways could play an important role in PKCζ-induced inhibition of apoptosis (32Lallena M.J. Diaz-Meco M.T. Bren G. Paya C.V. Moscat J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 2180-2188Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Indeed, NF-κB is a negative regulator of apoptosis induced by genotoxic agents, including topoisomerase II inhibitors (33Beg A.A. Baltimore D. Science. 1996; 274: 782-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (2926) Google Scholar, 34Wang C.Y. Mayo M.W. Baldwin Jr., A.S. Science. 1996; 274: 784-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (2500) Google Scholar). Therefore, we cannot rule out that PKCζ overexpression may result in the activation of anti-apoptotic signals that interfere with the post-damage apoptotic response and, therefore, contribute to drug resistance.To conclude, we propose a model in which, upon PKCζ accumulation in the nucleus, this enzyme interacts with and phosphorylates nuclear topoisomerase IIβ. Topoisomerase IIβ hyperphosphorylation reduces catalytic function and decreases formation of ternary complexes and drug-induced cytotoxicity. If so, nuclear PKCζ accumulation might function to regulate topoisomerase II function. Although very little is known about expression and subcellular localization of PKCζ in tumor cells, PKCζ may translocate to the nucleus upon stimulation by differentiating agents (35Bertolaso L. Gibellini D. Secchiero P. Previati M. Falgione D. Visani G. Rizzoli R. Capitani S. Zauli G. Br. J.

Whether PKCζ alters topoisomerase II function in these conditions will be the subject of further investigations. DNA topoisomerases II are nuclear enzymes that modify DNA topology by their ability to break and reseal both strands in concert. Topoisomerases II have important functions in DNA replication and can serve as a cancer chemotherapy target. Indeed, drugs such as etoposide (VP-16) or mitoxantrone, form drug-topoisomerase II-DNA ternary complexes referred to as “cleavable complex.” The primary cytotoxic effect of these so-called “topoisomerase II inhibitors” is not by inhibition of topoisomerase II activity but rather by stabilizing topoisomerase II cleavable complexes. This interaction prevents the DNA-resealing step normally catalyzed by topoisomerase II. The ternary complex constitutes a latent DNA-damaging state, which is ultimately converted to an irreversible DNA double-strand break (DSB).1 Although the mechanism by which complex formation mediates cell death is still poorly understood, it has been largely documented with few exceptions that the amount of cleavable complexes and the subsequent number of DNA breaks correlates with cytotoxicity (1Davies S.M. Robson C.N. Davies S.L. Hickson I.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 17724-17729Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These observations suggest that abnormal intracellular distribution or a decrease in expression level, activity, and sensitivity of the inhibited topoisomerase may have major impacts on topoisomerase inhibitor clinical efficacy. This has been confirmed by the molecular characterization of the so-called atypical multidrug resistant phenotype (at-MDR) resulting from selection by topoisomerase II inhibitors. Indeed, at-MDR cells display cross-resistance to other topoisomerase II inhibitors and have been associated with a number of functional and/or structural topoisomerase II alterations, including decreased catalytic activity, abnormal interaction between topoisomerase II and nuclear matrix, reduced expression, point mutation and, finally, altered phosphorylation (2Beck W.T. Danks M.K. Wolverton J.S. Chen M. Granzen B. Kim R. Suttle D.P. Adv. Pharmacol. 1994; 29B: 145-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The role of phosphorylation on topoisomerase II function has been debated and remains controversial. Indeed, previous studies have shown that topoisomerase II contains potential serine phosphorylation sites and that this enzyme is a substrate for various serine kinases, including casein kinase II, p34cdc2 kinase, and classic protein kinase C (PKC). In a cell-free system, PKC-induced phosphorylation of topoisomerase II results in an increase in its catalytic activity by enhancing ATP hydrolysis (3Corbett A.H. DeVore R.F. Osheroff N. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 20513-20518Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 4Corbett A.H. Fernald A.W. Osheroff N. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 2090-2097Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). In the absence of antineoplastic drugs, phosphorylation has a negligible effect on other steps of topoisomerase II catalytic cycle, including DNA binding or DNA cleavage/religation equilibrium. However, in the presence of VP-16 or amsacrine, phosphorylation decreases the ability of drugs to stabilize DNA-topoisomerase II complexes, apparently by increasing the rates of religation of DNA by the enzyme (5DeVore R.F. Corbett A.H. Osheroff N. Cancer Res. 1992; 52: 2156-2161PubMed Google Scholar). Other studies have provided indirect evidences that PKC might also influence topoisomerase II function in vivo. For example, PKC inhibitors, such as suramin or staurosporine, decrease topoisomerase II phosphorylation and catalytic activity in intact cells as well as drug-induced topoisomerase II-mediated cleavage (6Zwelling L.A. Altschuler E. Mayes J. Hinds M. Chan D. Cancer Chemother. Pharmacol. 1991; 29: 48-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar, 7Funayama Y. Nishio K. Takeda Y. Kubota N. Ohira T. Ohmori T. Ohta S. Ogasawara H. Hasegawa S. Saijo N. Anticancer Res. 1993; 13: 1981-1988PubMed Google Scholar). However, the role of topoisomerase II phosphorylation in drug resistance has been minimized on the basis of independent studies that have shown that, in at-MDR cells, topoisomerase II could be either hyperphosphorylated or hypophosphorylated (8Takano H. Kohno K. Ono M. Uchida Y. Kuwano M. Cancer Res. 1991; 51: 3951-3957PubMed Google Scholar, 9Chen M. Wolverton J.S. Beck W.T. Proc. Am. Assoc. Cancer Res. 1992; 33: 2707Google Scholar, 10Ritke M.K. Murray N.R. Allan W.P. Fields A.P. Yalowich J.C. Mol. Pharmacol. 1995; 48: 798-805PubMed Google Scholar). At least 12 different isoforms of PKC have been characterized so far and have been separated into three categories based on the Ca2+ requirement for activation and phorbol ester binding activity. Conventional PKCs (α, βI, βII, and γ) are Ca2+-dependent phorbol ester receptor kinases; novel PKCs (δ, ε, θ, and η) are Ca2+-independent phorbol ester receptor kinases; and atypical PKCs (ζ, ι, λ, and υ) are independent of both Ca2+ and phorbol ester. Previous studies have shown that topoisomerase II is phosphorylatedin vitro by each of the conventional PKC isoforms (11Wells N.J. Fry A.M. Guano F. Norbury C. Hickson I.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28357-28363Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). However, the influence of these PKC isozymes on cellular topoisomerase function in vivo is still largely unknown. Moreover, to the best of our knowledge, the influence of atypical PKC isozymes on topoisomerase II phosphorylation and function has not been investigated. PKC ζ is an atypical PKC isoform, which is activated directly or indirectly by a variety of important signaling molecules, including ceramide (12Lozano J. Berra E. Municio M.M. Diaz-Meco M.T.

Cell. 1993; 74: 555-563Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). PKC ζ has emerged as a critical regulator of a number of cellular functions, including proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis inhibition (18Moscat J. Sanz L. Sanchez P. Diaz-Meco M.T. Adv. Enzyme Reg. 2001; 41: 99-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Despite the critical role of this enzyme in cellular signaling, its implication in the regulation of topoisomerase II function has never been examined. This study was aimed to evaluate the effect of PKC ζ overexpression on the formation of cleavable complexes and cytotoxicity induced by VP-16 in the human leukemic U937 cells. DISCUSSIONThis study shows that PKCζ overexpression in U937 cells resulted in inhibition of apoptosis and increased survival of U937 cells treated with VP-16 and mitoxantrone, two topoisomerase II inhibitors. Enforced PKCζ expression resulted in a marked decrease in VP-16-induced DPC and DNA DSB, whereas the level of topoisomerase IIα and topoisomerase IIβ expression was unchanged compared with control cells. These results suggest that PKCζ can interfere with topoisomerase II function. In fact, we found that PKCζ-overexpressing cells exhibited reduced topoisomerase II catalytic function as measured by the decatenation assay. Altered topoisomerase II catalytic cycle may explain reduced drug-induced DNA damage and cytotoxicity. Thus, this study shows for the first time that a specific PKC isozyme may inhibit topoisomerase II catalytic activity and VP-16-induced apoptosis and cytotoxicity by interfering with drug-induced DNA damage.Based on the kinase function of PKCζ, we hypothesized that PKCζ overexpression might result in abnormal topoisomerase II phosphorylation. In fact, we found that, in PKCζ-overexpressing cells, PKCζ was not only found to interact with topoisomerase IIα and topoisomerase IIβ but also that these two topoisomerase II isoforms were heavily phosphorylated on serine residues. These results suggest that, in PKCζ-overexpressing cells, PKCζ not only directly or indirectly interacts with the two topoisomerase II isoforms but also phosphorylates these enzymes. However, using a cell-free system, we described that only topoisomerase IIβ is a substrate for PKCζ and that PKCζ inhibits topoisomerase IIβ activity. This result suggests that, in PKCζ-overexpressing cells, PKCζ interacts directly with topoisomerase IIβ and inhibits topoisomerase IIβ catalytic activity.

https://openalex.org/W1984806341,"The plasma membrane ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter Yor1p mediates oligomycin resistance in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Its protein sequence places it in the multidrug resistance protein/cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator subfamily of ABC transporters. A key regulatory step in the biogenesis of this family of ABC transporter proteins is at the level of transport from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) on through the secretory pathway. To explore the protein sequence requirements for Yor1p to move from the ER to its site of function at the plasma membrane, a series of truncation and alanine replacement mutations were constructed in Yor1p. This analysis detected two sequence motifs similar to the DXE element that has recently been found in other proteins that exit the ER. Loss of the N-terminal DXE element eliminated function of the protein, whereas loss of the C-terminal element only slightly reduced function of the resulting mutant Yor1p. Strikingly, although both of the single mutant proteins were stable, production of the double mutant caused dramatic destabilization of Yor1p. These data suggest that this large polytopic membrane protein requires multiple signals for normal forward trafficking, and elimination of this information may cause the mutant protein to be transferred to a degradative fate.

Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1992; 8: 67-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (3386) Google Scholar). The cytoplasmic nucleotide-binding domain (NBD) is the defining feature of these proteins, with most ABC transporters containing two NBDs and two multispanning transmembrane domains (TMDs). ABC transporters have been classified into subfamilies based upon sequence similarity and spacing of NBD1 motifs (2Cole S.P.C. Bhardwaj G. Gerlach J.H. Mackie J.E. Grant C.E. Almquist K.C.

One of the largest known subfamilies in humans contains the multidrug resistance proteins (MRPs), often overexpressed in tumors (4Borst P. Evers R. Kool M. Wijnholds J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1461: 347-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (583) Google Scholar), and the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) that, when mutated, results in cystic fibrosis (5Tsui L.-C.

Most members of this subfamily have a primary structure of two direct repeats of a unit composed of a TMD followed by an NBD. Whereas MRP/CFTR ABC transporters show strong similarity in their NBDs, they have significant diversity at their N and C termini. MRP1 contains an additional TMD at its N terminus (TMD0) connected to the rest of the protein via a cytoplasmic linker region (L0). Deletion of TMD0 and L0 from MRP1 results in mislocalization of the protein and loss of substrate transport (7Bakos E. Evers R. Szakacs G. Tusnady G.E. Welker E. Szabo K. de Haas M. van Deemter L.

The two first described yeast MRP/CFTR family members were Ycf1p and Yor1p. Ycf1p is a vacuolar glutathione conjugate transporter that shares strong sequence similarity with MRP1 (23Szczypka M.S.

Microbiol. 1997; 25: 683-694Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), and Yor1p is a plasma membrane protein required for normal tolerance to oligomycin (26Cui Z. Hirata D. Tsuchiya E. Osada H. Miyakawa T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14712-14716Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 27Katzmann D.J. Hallstrom T.C. Voet M. Wysock W. Golin J. Volckaert G. Moye-Rowley W.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 6875-6883Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). Intriguingly, both Ycf1p and Yor1p share a phenylalanine residue that is conserved with CFTR in the NBD1 region of these three proteins (27Katzmann D.J. Hallstrom T.C. Voet M. Wysock W. Golin J. Volckaert G. Moye-Rowley W.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 6875-6883Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). Deletion of this phenylalanine residue from CFTR (ΔF508) is the major disease-causing allele found at this locus (6Welsh M.J. Smith A.E. Cell. 1993; 73: 1251-1254Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1236) Google Scholar) leading to ER retention and increased ER-associated degradation of the protein (28Cheng S.H. Gregory R.J. Marshall J. Paul S. Souza D.W. White G.A. O'Riordan C.R. Smith A.E. Cell. 1990; 63: 827-834Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1427) Google Scholar, 29Ward C.L. Omura S. Kopito R.R. Cell. 1995; 83: 121-127Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1133) Google Scholar). Analogous cell biological defects are seen when the corresponding phenylalanine residues are deleted from either Ycf1p (25Wemmie J.A. Moye-Rowley W.S. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 25: 683-694Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) or Yor1p (30Katzmann D. Epping E. Moye-Rowley W.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 2998-3009Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although these observations illustrate the similarities of NBD1 structure and function, the variability of N and C termini suggests these regions are important for functional specificity of ABC transporters. The structure of Yor1p, like that of CFTR (1Higgins C.F. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1992; 8: 67-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (3386) Google Scholar), is predicted to have both termini cytoplasmically located (27Katzmann D.J. Hallstrom T.C. Voet M. Wysock W. Golin J. Volckaert G. Moye-Rowley W.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 6875-6883Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). We have found that N- and C-terminal truncations of Yor1p result in ER localization and loss of oligomycin tolerance but generally no change in Yor1p stability. Alanine substitution mutagenesis identified residues important for normal expression and function of the protein, namely the ER localization defect was specifically observed for mutations in a diacidic DXE sequence (X is any amino acid) in the N terminus of Yor1p. DXE sequences have been shown to be required for efficient export of several proteins from the ER (31Nishimura N. Balch W.E. Science. 1997; 277: 556-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar, 32Votsmeier C. Gallwitz D. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 6742-6750Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), and this N-terminal DXE in Yor1p is one sequence that is required for its forward trafficking. Interestingly, this N-terminal DXE element is not sufficient for forward traffic of Yor1p because truncation mutations in the C terminus also fail to exit the ER. Mutation of a DXE sequence at the C terminus of Yor1p resulted in only a modest alteration in localization and oligomycin tolerance, whereas elimination of both DXE elements produced a form of Yor1p that failed to leave the ER and was strongly destabilized. These data indicate that multiple signals are required for forward traffic of Yor1p and suggest that elimination of the ability to exit the ER causes the mutant Yor1p to become a substrate for a degradative pathway. The yeast strains used in this study were DKY7 (ura3-52 leu2-3, -112 his3-Δ200 trp1-Δ901 lys2-801 suc2-Δ9 Mel-yor1-1::hisG) and EEY40 (ura3-52, leu2-3, -112 his3-Δ200 trp1-Δ901 lys2-801 suc2-Δ9 Mel- yor1-1::hisG PDR1-3). Both are derivatives of SEY6210 (ura3-52 leu2-3 -112 his3-Δ200 trp1-Δ901 lys2-801 suc2-Δ9 Mel−). EEY40 replaces the wild-type PDR1 gene with the gain-of-functionPDR1-3 allele. It was constructed by transforming DKY7 with a SacI/ApaI PDR1-3 fragment isolated from pRS315-PDR1-3 (33Carvajal E. van den Hazel H.B. Cybularz-Kolaczkowska A. Balzi E. Goffeau A. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1997; 256: 406-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Transformants were grown in YPD at 30 °C with shaking for 2 h prior to selection on YPD plates containing 0.4 μg/ml cycloheximide. Candidates containing thePDR1-3 allele were tested for increased cycloheximide and oligomycin resistance and for increased Yor1p expression by Western blotting of whole cell extracts after introduction of a low copy number plasmid carrying wild-type YOR1. DKY7 was used for all experiments except fluorescence microscopy, where EEY40 was used to enhance the GFP signal. All yeast transformations were carried out using the lithium acetate procedure (34Ito H. Fukuda Y. Murata K. Kimura A. J. Bacteriol. 1983; 153: 163-168Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were grown in cultures containing YPD (2% yeast extract, 1% peptone, 2% glucose) under nonselective conditions or appropriate SC media under selective conditions (35Sherman F. Fink G. Hicks J. Methods in Yeast Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1979Google Scholar). Drug resistance was measured by the spot test assay on plates with either single concentrations of drug or gradient plates (27Katzmann D.J. Hallstrom T.C. Voet M. Wysock W. Golin J. Volckaert G. Moye-Rowley W.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 6875-6883Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar, 30Katzmann D. Epping E. Moye-Rowley W.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 2998-3009Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Oligomycin plates contained YPGE media (2% yeast extract, 1% peptone, 3% glycerol, 3% ethanol). Single copy Yor1p-GFP-expressing plasmids were constructed using the method described by Longtine et al.(36Longtine M.S. McKenzie III, A. Demarini D.J. Shah N.G. Wach A. Brachat A. Philippsen P. Pringle J.R. Yeast. 1998; 14: 953-961Crossref PubMed Scopus (4193) Google Scholar). The forward PCR primer contained 50 nucleotides of the C-terminalYOR1-coding sequence followed by the F2 sequence described by Longtine et al. (36Longtine M.S. McKenzie III, A. Demarini D.J. Shah N.G. Wach A. Brachat A. Philippsen P. Pringle J.R. Yeast. 1998; 14: 953-961Crossref PubMed Scopus (4193) Google Scholar); the reverse primer contained 50 nucleotides of pRS316 sequence followed by the R1 primer sequence. With these primers the GFP(S65T)-TRP1 sequence was amplified from the corresponding pFA6a plasmid and co-transformed into DKY7 with either the wild-type YOR1 plasmid pDK59 or the ΔF670YOR1 plasmid pDK61 (30Katzmann D. Epping E. Moye-Rowley W.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 2998-3009Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) linearized at the 3′ end of theYOR1 gene with KpnI. Transformants were first selected on Ura− media, then tested for TRP1 prototrophy, expression of Yor1p-GFP by Western blotting, plasma membrane localization, and complementation of yor1 oligomycin resistance. Plasmids were recovered using the method of Robzyk and Kassir (37Robzyk K. Kassir Y. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 3790Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar) and sequenced to confirm the presence of the GFP fusion. The fusion to wild-type YOR1 was designated pEAE64, and the ΔF670 fusion was named pEAE66. A SalI site was engineered at YOR1 codons 58 and 59 in pEAE64 using a two-step PCR process (38Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) to generate plasmid pEAE93. In the first PCR step, two products were generated from pEAE64 using the oligonucleotides CGC TAT AGC CGT CAC TGG and GGT TTG GGG CTT ATT TCT GTCgAC AAT ATA TTC ACC TGT AGG CAG for the first product, and GGT TTG GGG CTT ATT TCT GTcGAC AAT ATA TTC ACC TGT AGG CAG and CGC AGC AAT TCT AAA GCC for the second product. The underlined sequences are theSalI site, the c/g in lowercase is the base changed from G/C in wild-type YOR1, which produces a conserved codon change from GTG to GTC at Val-58. This alteration did not affect expression, localization, or function of the mutant (data not shown). The products from the first step contain fragments from −705 to 195 and 151–1122 numbered relative to translation start. These products were combined to make the template in the second PCR step and amplified using the outside primers from step 1 to generate a new product from −705 to 1122 in YOR1. The final product was cut with enzymesNheI and SphI and cloned into the same sites in pEAE64. All PCR products were verified by sequencing. All N-terminal mutant forms of YOR1 were generated in the context of pEAE93. All truncations except the one from residues 2–57 were generated using the two-step PCR method described above with the same outside primers at −705 and 1122 for the final products, but with appropriate complementary mutagenic primers containing 20 nucleotides of 5′ YOR1 sequence up to and including the ATG followed by 20 nucleotides of coding sequence from truncations starting at amino acid residues 39, 78, 97, 114, and 201. The PCR products generated were cloned into pEAE93 as Eco47III/SphI fragments to replace the wild-type sequence. The truncation starting at residue 57 was constructed in one PCR step using the −705 primer and the primer CGG GTC GAC CAT ATT CGT ATA TAG CAA CG to generate a fragment from −705 to 4 in wild-type YOR1 sequence followed by aSalI site. The product was cloned into the pCR2.1 TOPO vector (Invitrogen), and the Eco47III/SalIYOR1 fragment was cloned into the same sites in pEAE93. The internal deletions were constructed using the same 3′ primer to 1122 described above with various forward primers containing aSalI site followed by 20 nucleotides ofYOR1-coding sequence starting at residues 97, 114, and 201. The PCR products were cloned into pCR2.1 TOPO and then cut withSalI and SphI and cloned into the same sites of pEAE93. The triple alanine substitution mutants were constructed by either one- or two-step PCR amplification. For the triple alanine mutants starting at residues 60, 63, 66, 69, and 72, a single PCR product using the reverse primer ACC TTT GTT AAC ATG CAT GC from nucleotides 728–746 inYOR1 and various forward primers starting at theSalI site containing the mutagenic sequence GCC GCG GCT to change the desired residues to alanine were made and cloned into pEAE93 as SalI/SphI fragments. The triple alanine mutants starting at residues 75 and 77 were constructed by the two-step PCR method using the 3′ primer from 728–746, a 20-nucleotide 5′ primer starting at nucleotide 108 and complementary mutagenic primers containing the appropriate substitutions. The final products were cloned into pCR2.1 TOPO and then subcloned asSalI/SphI fragments into pEAE93. Clones containing the triple alanine mutants were identified by the introduction of a new SacII site. The single and double alanine substitutions were made in one PCR step with appropriate mutagenic primers and cloned into the 72AAA substitution mutant plasmid as a SalI/SphI fragment. These mutants were identified by the loss of the SacII site because of replacement of the triple alanine mutant sequence with the single or double mutant sequences and verified by sequencing. The C-terminal deletions were constructed by the same method used to generate pEAE64 with the same reverse primer and different forward primers containing 50 nucleotides of YOR1 coding sequence up the end of each truncation followed by the F2 sequence for amplification of the GFP(S65T)-TRP1 template. The C-terminal alanine substitution mutant was constructed by the two-step PCR process described above using the same 3′ primer used to construct the GFP fusions, a 5′ primer starting at nucleotide 4117 in the YOR1coding sequence, and complementary mutagenic primers containing the appropriate substitutions. The final PCR product was co-transformed with vector DNA from the Δ1453 mutant linearized withSmaI, which cuts between the YOR1 and GFP sequences. Recovered plasmids were sequenced to verify the correct recombination containing the YOR1 mutant sequence. The combined N- and C-terminal alanine substitution mutant was constructed by cloning an XhoI/SphI fragment from the DIE71AIA mutant into the same sites in the C-terminal mutant. The presence of the N-terminal mutation was verified by sequencing. Preparation of whole cell extracts, determination of protein concentration, and Western blotting using affinity-purified anti-C-terminal Yor1p antibodies were performed as described previously (30Katzmann D. Epping E. Moye-Rowley W.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 2998-3009Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Transformants containing the various mutants of Yor1p-GFP were grown to anA 600 of 0.5. For cells stained with FM4-64 (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR), 1 ml of cells were incubated for 30 min at 30 °C in 1 ml of 500 nm FM4-64 with 40 mmKPO4 and 1% glucose, followed by incubation for 30 min at 30 °C in 1 ml of selective SC media. 1 μl of 1 mg/ml 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) was added to 1 ml of cells and incubated at room temperature for 30 min with gentle agitation in the dark. Cells were visualized for GFP, FM4-64, or DAPI fluorescence and Nomarski optics using an Olympus (Tokyo, Japan) BX-60 microscope with a 100× oil objective. Images were captured using a Hamamatsu (Shizuoka, Japan) ORCA charge-coupled device camera. Isolation and separation of cell membranes on sucrose density gradients in the presence of 10 mm EDTA was described previously (30Katzmann D. Epping E. Moye-Rowley W.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 2998-3009Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Fractions were Western-blotted using appropriate antibodies. Labeling and immunoprecipitation were carried out as described previously (30Katzmann D. Epping E. Moye-Rowley W.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 2998-3009Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), except that crude anti-C-terminal Yor1p antibody was used at a dilution of 1:100 for immunoprecipitation, and gels were not soaked in sodium salicylate. All gels were visualized by the Packard Instrument Co. Cyclone PhosphorImager and quantitated using NIH Image 1.61. Preparation of membranes and photoaffinity labeling with 8-azido-[α-32P]ATP (ICN, Irvine, CA) was described previously (39Proff C. Kolling R. Mol. Gen. Genet. 2001; 264: 883-893Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). After labeling, 100 μl of 4% SDS sample buffer containing 125 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 20% glycerol, 20 μm dithiothreitol, and 0.02% bromphenol blue was added, and samples were incubated at 37 °C for 1 h. 480 μl of dilution buffer (1.25% Triton X-100, 6 mm EDTA, 60 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 190 mm NaCl) was added, and the samples were spun at top speed for 5 min to remove debris. 6 μl of crude anti-C-terminal Yor1p antibody was added to the supernatant, and samples were incubated end-over-end at 4 °C overnight. 20 μl of protein-A-agarose beads (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) were added followed by a 3-h end-over-end incubation at room temperature. The beads were washed three times with wash buffer (1% Triton X-100, 0.2% SDS, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5), then resuspended in 30 μl of Yor1p sample buffer (40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 8 m urea, 15% SDS, 0.1 mm EDTA, 1% β-mercaptoethanol, 0.01% bromphenol blue), and incubated for 30 min at 37 °C. 15 μl of each sample were separated on a 7.5% SDS-PAGE gel, fixed in 7.5% acetic acid, 40% MeOH, dried, and then exposed to a PhosphorImaging screen for visualization. In previous work, the localization of Yor1p in intact cells was assessed by indirect immunofluorescence (27Katzmann D.J. Hallstrom T.C. Voet M. Wysock W. Golin J. Volckaert G. Moye-Rowley W.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 6875-6883Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). Although this method localized the wild-type protein to the plasma membrane, it was unable to detect ER-retained Yor1p mutants. A fusion of the GFP to the C terminus of wild-type and ER-retained ΔF670 Yor1p was constructed to facilitate analysis of Yor1p mutants (Fig. 1 A). The wild-type Yor1p-GFP fusion protein localized to the plasma membrane, consistent with our earlier experiments (30Katzmann D. Epping E. Moye-Rowley W.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 2998-3009Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Intracellular fluorescence was found to be within the vacuole lumen, as shown by co-localization with the vacuolar marker FM464. Because the wild-type protein is degraded by the vacuole, it is likely this signal is due to fluorescence of Yor1p-GFP molecules undergoing degradation. Fluorescence of the ΔF670 Yor1p was found only in perinuclear and subsurface compartments. This is consistent with endoplasmic reticulum localization, consistent with our previous findings (27Katzmann D.J. Hallstrom T.C. Voet M. Wysock W. Golin J. Volckaert G. Moye-Rowley W.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 6875-6883Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). The GFP-tagged constructs were tested for their ability to confer oligomycin resistance and compared with the corresponding untagged versions (Fig. 1 B). The addition of the GFP tag did not change the oligomycin resistance profile of either form of Yor1p. Expression levels of the GFP fusions were also measured (Fig.1 C). The ΔF670 Yor1p-GFP mutant was less abundant than the wild-type form, similar to results previously shown for the untagged version. These results show that fusion of a wild-type or mutant form of Yor1p to GFP produces a chimera that faithfully reproduces the behavior of the untagged protein. Although Ycf1p and Yor1p are MRP/CFTR homologues in S. cerevisiae, these two yeast proteins differ dramatically at their N termini. The vacuolar Ycf1p, like MRP1, is predicted to contain five additional membrane-spanning segments that comprise TMD0, whereas Yor1p, like CFTR, does not appear to have this additional TMD region (27Katzmann D.J.

A hydropathy plot for the first 200 residues of Yor1p was determined, and the region was predicted to be primarily hydrophilic and intracellular (Fig. 2 A) (41Kyte J. Doolittle R.F. J. Mol. Biol. 1982; 157: 105-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (17293) Google Scholar). To explore the possibility that the remarkably different N terminus in Yor1p might explain its differential trafficking in the cell, we constructed a series of N-terminal mutations for expression from the YOR1 promoter on low copy number plasmids (Fig.2 A). Each mutant is named by the final residue deleted in a given mutant. For example, Δ38 has residues 2–38 deleted, and the original residue 39 in Yor1p is now residue 2 in this mutant protein. The mutants were transformed into the yor1 strain DKY7 and tested for their ability to complement the oligomycin hypersensitivity of this strain. Deletion of residues 2–38 (Δ38) actually increased Yor1p-mediated resistance above wild-type levels. The Δ57 mutant provided some oligomycin resistance, although it was slightly less than the wild-type protein. Deletions beyond residue 57 resulted in the complete loss of oligomycin tolerance. Internal deletions starting from residue 60 and extending to residues 77, 96, or 113 were also unable to provide oligomycin resistance. The expression levels of the mutant proteins were analyzed by Western blotting using antibodies against the C terminus of Yor1p (Fig.2 B). All mutants but the Δ77 deletion were expressed at least the same as wild-type Yor1p, indicating the loss of oligomycin resistance in the others was not due to reduced expression. Expression of the Δ38 mutant was slightly elevated above wild-type levels, consistent with its increased oligomycin tolerance. The Δ77 mutant most likely has a defect at the level of mRNA or protein synthesis as we were unable to 35S label and immunoprecipitate the mutant protein under our standard labeling conditions (data not shown). Detectable levels of the Δ77 mutant were observed when the protein was expressed in a strain with a gain of function allele of the transcription factor PDR1, shown previously (27Katzmann D.J. Hallstrom T.C. Voet M. Wysock W. Golin J. Volckaert G. Moye-Rowley W.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 6875-6883Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar) to increase expression of Yor1p (data not shown). Localization of Yor1p-GFP N-terminal deletions was determined by fluorescence microscopy (Fig.3). Truncations up to residues 38 and 57 were plasma membrane-localized. Interestingly, vacuolar fluorescence was markedly reduced in the Δ38 mutant, suggesting that the increase in the steady-state level of this mutant protein might be explained by a reduction in the level of vacuolar degradation of the Δ38 mutant. Even though the Δ77 mutant was reduced in expression, a few cells were found with an endoplasmic reticulum fluorescence pattern"

TNF occurs in two forms: a type II membrane protein (memTNF) and a soluble form (sTNF) derived therefrom by proteolytic processing (1Wajant H. Scheurich P. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2001; 33: 19-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Two distinct receptors for TNF, TNF-R1 and TNF-R2, transduce TNF signals (1Wajant H. Scheurich P. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2001; 33: 19-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Although memTNF can potently trigger both TNF receptors, sTNF acts predominantly via TNF-R1 (1Wajant H. Scheurich P. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2001; 33: 19-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). The TNF receptors are the prototypic name given to representatives of the TNF receptor superfamily (2Locksley R.M. Killeen N. Lenardo M.J. Cell. 2001; 104: 487-501Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2988) Google Scholar). Based on the presence of a death domain, the TNF receptor family can be subdivided into death receptors and receptors without a death domain (2Locksley R.M. Killeen N. Lenardo M.J. Cell. 2001; 104: 487-501Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2988) Google Scholar). Although TNF-R1 is a member of the death receptor group, TNF-R2 belongs to the non-death domain-containing receptors (2Locksley R.M. Killeen N. Lenardo M.J. Cell. 2001; 104: 487-501Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2988) Google Scholar). Stimulation of death receptors typically leads to the recruitment of cytoplasmic death domain-containing adaptor proteins that couple death receptors to the apoptotic machinery of the cell (2Locksley R.M. Killeen N. Lenardo M.J. Cell. 2001; 104: 487-501Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2988) Google Scholar). In contrast, non-death domain-containing receptors interact with members of the TNF receptor-associated factor (TRAF) family of adaptor proteins that mediate activation of NF-κB, JNK, and p38 (2Locksley R.M. Killeen N. Lenardo M.J. Cell. 2001; 104: 487-501Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2988) Google Scholar, 3Wajant H. Henkler F. Scheurich P. Cell Signal. 2001; 13: 389-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). In contrast to other death receptors, e.g. Fas, which are predominantly recognized as death inducers, TNF-R1 has a variety of non-apoptotic immunoregulatory functions. At first glance, the less apparent apoptotic activity of TNF-R1 can be explained by the fact that TNF-R1 is a potent activator of the anti-apoptotic NF-κB pathway. Indeed, if TNF-R1-induced NF-κB activation is compromised,e.g. in knock-out mice deficient in components of the NF-κB pathway, TNF-R1 triggering leads to apoptosis induction in normally TNF-insensitive cells (1Wajant H. Scheurich P. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2001; 33: 19-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 3Wajant H. Henkler F. Scheurich P. Cell Signal. 2001; 13: 389-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). Although TNF-R2 has no death domain, selective stimulation of this receptor, e.g. by use of agonistic antibodies, is sufficient to induce apoptosis in some cells (4Heller R.A. Song K. Fan N. Chang D.J. Cell. 1992; 70: 47-56Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar, 5Bigda J. Beletsky I. Brakebusch C. Varfolomeev Y. Engelmann H. Bigda J. Holtmann H. Wallach D. J. Exp.

TNF-R2-induced apoptosis is not caused by a direct activation of the apoptotic caspase cascade but rather is mediated indirectly by production of endogenous TNF, which subsequently signals cell death via TNF-R1 (8Grell M. Zimmermann G. Gottfried E. Chen C.M. Grunwald U. Huang D.C., Wu Lee Y.H. Durkop H. Engelmann H. Scheurich P. Wajant H. Strasser A.

Cytokine. 1995; 7: 463-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). In addition, there is evidence that TNF-R2 can enhance TNF-R1-induced cell death independently of endogenous TNF by depletion of cytoplasmic TRAF2-containing anti-apoptotic protein complexes (10Chan F.K. Lenardo M.J. Eur. J. Immunol. 2000; 30: 652-660Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11Declercq W. Denecker G. Fiers W. Vandenabeele P. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 390-399PubMed Google Scholar, 12Duckett C.S.

In this study we show that induction of endogenous memTNF and subsequent triggering of TNF-R2 act as a powerful amplification mechanism in TNF-R1-induced apoptosis. Accordingly, by that mechanism, a short TNF pulse can be sufficient to trigger cell death, whereas prolonged TNF treatment is necessary for apoptosis induction in cells in which TNF-R1 triggering does not up-regulate endogenous TNF. The human rhabdomyosarcoma cell line, Kym-1, was a generous gift from M. Sekiguchi (University of Tokyo, Japan), and the human cervical carcinoma cell line, HeLa, was obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). Cells were maintained in Click's RPMI medium (Biochrom, Berlin, Germany) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Kym-1) or in RPMI medium (Biochrom) supplemented with 5% fetal calf serum (HeLa). TRAIL·M2 complex was generated by mixing the respective concentration of Flag-tagged TRAIL with the anti-Flag monoclonal antibody M2 (Sigma-Aldrich) to a final concentration of 1 μg/ml of antibody. After 15 min of incubation at room temperature, the formed TRAIL·M2 complex was transferred to the cells. The anti-Flag monoclonal antibody M2 was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Flag-tagged TRAIL and Flag-tagged TWEAK were generously supplied by P. Schneider and J. Tschopp (University of Lausanne, Switzerland). The TNF-R1-specific mAb Htr1 (15Brockhaus M. Schoenfeld H.J.

The neutralizing TNF-specific mAb 101-4 was a kind gift from A. Meager (National Institute for Biological Standards and Control, South Mimms, UK). Geldanamycin was from Sigma-Aldrich. Cells (20 × 103) were grown overnight in 100 μl of culture medium in 96-well plates. The next day cells were treated with the indicated concentrations of TNF, TNF-R1/2-specific antibody, TRAIL-M2 complex, or TWEAK. Where indicated cells were pretreated overnight with geldanamycin. Cell death assays with HeLa cells (20 × 103/well) were performed in the presence of 2.5 μg/ml cycloheximide. Cell viability was determined using crystal violet staining as described elsewhere (14Weiss T. Grell M. Hessabi B. Bourteele S. Muller G. Scheurich P. Wajant H. J. Immunol. 1997; 158: 2398-2404PubMed Google Scholar). Kym-1 cells (2 × 106) were seeded in 100-mm Petri dishes and cultivated overnight. The next day cells were treated as indicated. Total RNA was isolated with the RNA INSTAPURE kit (Eurogentech, Seraing, Belgium) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. The presence of transcripts of the indicated cytokine genes, including TNF, and the internal controls L32 and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase were analyzed using the Multi-Probe template set, hCK-3 (PharMingen, Hamburg, Germany). Probe synthesis, hybridization, and RNase treatment were performed with the RiboQuant Multi-Probe RNase Protection Assay System (PharMingen) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. After RNase treatment the protected transcripts were resolved by electrophoresis on a denaturing polyacrylamide gel (5%) and analyzed on a PhosphorImager with ImageQuant software (AmershamBiosciences). To correct the signals of protected transcripts, the background intensities were determined for each individual transcript in the close neighborhood of the respective band and subtracted from the value of the protected transcript. Finally, TNF signal intensities were normalized using the intensities of the corresponding endogenous controls. Cell lysates were prepared in radioimmune precipitation buffer supplemented with 0.1 volume of a protease inhibitor mixture stock solution (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). After removal of cell debris by centrifugation at 10,000 × gfor 10 min, protein concentrations were determined by the Bradford assay. Lysates (100 μg) were resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes by electroblotting, and nonspecific binding sites were blocked by incubation in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.05% Tween 20 and 3% (w/v) dry milk. Procaspase-8 (p55/53) and the p18 and p41/43 fragments derived therefrom by proteolytic processing were visualized with a caspase-8-specific mAb (kindly provided by Klaus Schulze- Osthoff) and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse-IgG (Sigma) using nitro blue tetrazolium and 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate as substrates. For detection of I-κBα, a 1:2000 dilution of a polyclonal rabbit IgG preparation (PharMingen) and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Sigma) were used. For ELISA of endogenously produced TNF, cells were treated as indicated, harvested, and lysed in 300 μl of 20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mmEDTA, 1% Triton X-100 complemented with a protease inhibitor mixture for 30 min on ice. After removal of debris (14,000 × gfor 10 min) lysates were adjusted with respect to protein concentration. Calibrated lysates, the corresponding cell culture supernatants, and supernatants concentrated 15-fold by polyethylene glycol dialysis were analyzed with a human TNF-specific ELISA (PharMingen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. For ELISA of TNF-R1-induced IL-6 production, HeLa cells were treated as indicated, and the corresponding cell culture supernatants were analyzed by a human IL-6-specific ELISA (PharMingen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. HeLa were seeded with a density of 1.5 × 104 cells/well in 96-well plate, and the next day cells were transfected with 250 ng/ml of a mixture of the following plasmids: empty vector (70%), a luciferase reporter plasmid driven by three consensus NF-κB sites (20%), and a β-galactosidase expression vector driven by the SV40 promoter (10%) using the Superfect reagent (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) according to the manufacturer's instructions. After 1 day of recovery, cells were stimulated as indicated and lysed by the addition of 50 μl of luciferase lysis solution (Galactolight Kit, Tropix) and one freeze-thaw cycle. 25 μl of each extract was mixed with 50 μl of luciferase substrate (Luciferase Assay System, Promega), and the luminescence was determined in the single photon mode using an Anthos microplate luminometer (Lucy 2). In addition, 25 μl of each cell extract was incubated for 1 h with 25 μl of Galacto Plus substrate (Galacto Plus, 1:100 in Galacto reaction buffer diluent). Finally, lysates were mixed with 100 μl of Accelerator II solution to determine relative β-galactosidase activity (Galactolight Kit) again with the Anthos microplate luminometer (Lucy 2). To obtain relative luciferase units, luciferase activities were normalized with respect to activities of the cotransfected β-galactosidase. We have recently shown that apoptosis induction by the non-death domain-containing receptor TNF-R2 critically depends on the induction of endogenous TNF and subsequent triggering of the death receptor TNF-R1 in Kym-1 cells (8Grell M. Zimmermann G. Gottfried E. Chen C.M. Grunwald U. Huang D.C., Wu Lee Y.H. Durkop H. Engelmann H. Scheurich P. Wajant H. Strasser A. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3034-3043Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). As TNF can also be induced via TNF-R1, we asked whether induction of endogenous TNF also contributes to the cytotoxic effect of TNF-R1 itself. We therefore examined whether interference with the gene-inducing capacity of TNF-R1 affects apoptosis induction by exclusive stimulation of this receptor, i.e. by soluble TNF or TNF-R1-specific agonistic antibodies. To block TNF-R1-mediated gene induction, cells were pretreated with geldanamycin (GA), which interferes with heat shock protein 90 (Hsp-90) function (17Whitesell L. Mimnaugh E.G., De Costa B. Myers C.E. Neckers L.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 8324-8328Crossref PubMed Scopus (1319) Google Scholar). Impairment of Hsp-90 function prevents TNF-R1-induced NF-κB activation in at least two ways: first, by degradation of the Hsp-90-associated kinase RIP (18Lewis J. Devin A. Miller A. Lin Y. Rodriguez Y. Neckers L. Liu Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 10519-10526Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar), a molecule having an essential role in TNF-R1-induced NF-κB activation (19Kelliher M.A. Grimm S. Ishida Y. Kuo F. Stanger B.Z. Leder P. Immunity. 1998; 8: 297-303Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (918) Google Scholar), and second, by inhibition of the recruitment of the IKK complex to TNF-R1 (20Chen G. Cao P. Goeddel D.V. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 401-410Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). Soluble TNF or agonistic TNF-R1-specific antibodies induce a full apoptotic response in Kym-1 cells within 8 h. In contrast, apoptosis induction by stimulation of the non-death domain-containing receptor TNF-R2 needs a prolonged incubation overnight to become detectable (data not shown and Ref. 21Schneider P. Schwenzer R. Haas E. Muhlenbeck F. Schubert G. Scheurich P. Tschopp J. Wajant H. Eur. J. Immunol. 1999; 29: 1785-1792Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). The delayed onset of TNF-R2-induced apoptosis is in good agreement with the absolute dependence of this process from newly synthesized endogenous TNF. Surprisingly, rapid TNF-R1-dependent apoptosis, triggered by sTNF or the agonistic TNF-R1-specific mAb Htr1, was almost completely prevented by GA when measured after 8 h (Fig. 1,A and C) but was only slightly affected when determined after 24 h (Fig. 1 B). In contrast, apoptosis induction by TRAIL, which induces apoptosis by a similar FADD- and caspase-8-dependent pathway like TNF (22Schneider P. Tschopp J. Pharm. Acta Helv. 2000; 74: 281-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar), was not inhibited but rather was enhanced by geldanamycin in 8 h assays (Fig. 1 D). Slow cell death induction by agonistic TNF-R2-specific antibodies as well as by TWEAK, a member of the TNF ligand family that also induces cell death in Kym-1 cells by endogenous TNF (21Schneider P. Schwenzer R. Haas E. Muhlenbeck F. Schubert G. Scheurich P. Tschopp J. Wajant H. Eur. J. Immunol. 1999; 29: 1785-1792Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar), was also blocked by geldanamycin (Fig. 1,E and F). Thus, RIP and/or the IKK complex also could play a role in these apoptotic processes. Remarkably, the proteasome inhibitor MG-132, which is able to block NF-κB activation by inhibition of I-κB degradation, conferred significant protection against sTNF-induced apoptosis in 8 h assays (Fig.1 G) but sensitized cells for the apoptotic action of sTNF in 24 h assays (Fig. 1 H). In contrast, TRAIL-induced apoptosis was sensitized by MG-132 in short (8 h) and long (24 h) time assays (Fig. 1, I and J). In comparison with GA, the inhibitory effect of MG-132 on TNF-induced apoptosis after 8 h was less efficient. Moreover, in 24 h assays MG-132 showed even a strong pro-apoptotic capacity. This might reflect that MG-132, in contrast to GA, not only inhibits the sTNF-induced production of NF-κB-dependent genes (TNF and also the anti-apoptotic factors TRAF1 (23Schwenzer R. Siemienski K.

A. 1999; 96: 9136-9141Crossref PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar)) but also interferes with the constitutive expression of anti-apoptotic factors. In accordance with this idea, we found that MG-132, but not GA, sensitized several cell lines for death receptor-induced apoptosis in the absence of cycloheximide (data not shown), which is necessary in many cell lines to allow efficient apoptosis-induction. It has been shown recently that death receptors can induce necrosis instead of apoptosis by a RIP-dependent but caspase-independent pathway (29Holler N. Zaru R. Micheau O. Thome M. Attinger A. Valitutti S. Bodmer J.L. Schneider P. Seed B. Tschopp J. Nat. Immunol. 2000; 1: 489-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (1427) Google Scholar). To check whether in Kym-1 cells necrosis induction is responsible for the observed cytotoxic effects of TNF, agonistic TNF receptor-specific antibodies, and TRAIL, we analyzed the cytotoxic effects of these reagents in the presence of the caspase inhibitor z-VAD-fmk, which is able to completely block apoptosis triggered by death receptors. In all cases, z-VAD-fmk treatment conferred complete protection (data not shown), therefore ruling out the idea that necrosis induction plays an important role. Accordingly, we found that GA and MG-132 inhibited TNF and Htr1- but not TRAIL-induced processing of caspase-8 (Fig. 2). Together, these data suggest that TNF-R1-dependent induction of protein synthesis significantly contributes to TNF-R1-dependent apoptosis.Figure 2Geldanamycin and Mg-132 inhibit TNF-R1-induced caspase-8 processing. Kym-1 cells were incubated overnight in the absence or presence of geldanamycin (0.5 μm). The next day, cells were challenged with TNF (20 ng/ml), αTNF-R1 mAb Htr1 (250 ng/ml), or cross-linked TRAIL (100 ng/ml) for the indicated time. In groups in which the apoptotic challenge was given in the presence of MG-132 (10 μm), the cells were pretreated with this compound for 15 min. Finally, cell lysates were prepared, and procaspase-8 processing was analyzed by immunoblotting.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Next, we analyzed the impact of GA and MG-132 on TNF receptor-mediated gene induction by RNase protection assay analyses. Soluble TNF, the TNF-R1-specific agonistic mAb Htr1, and to a lesser extent agonistic TNF-R2-specific antibodies and TWEAK indeed up-regulated TNF-mRNA (Fig.3 A) as well as the well known NF-κB target genes TRAF1 and cIAP2 (data not shown). In accordance with the role of endogenously produced TNF in apoptosis induction, GA blocked TNF induction by the above mentioned reagents (Fig.3 A). As early as 1 h after TNF-R1 stimulation, an almost half-maximal up-regulation of TNF mRNA was observed (Fig. 3,B and C). To demonstrate directly the importance of endogenous TNF in TNF-R1-triggered apoptosis, we analyzed the impact of neutralizing TNF-specific antibodies. In a former study, we showed that a neutralizing TNF-specific antibody blocks TNF-R2- but not TNF-R1-triggerd apoptosis and failed to find evidence for a measurable contribution of endogenous TNF in TNF-R1-induced apoptosis (8Grell M. Zimmermann G. Gottfried E. Chen C.M. Grunwald U. Huang D.C., Wu Lee Y.H. Durkop H. Engelmann H. Scheurich P. Wajant H. Strasser A. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3034-3043Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). However, in this study, we have searched for an involvement of endogenous TNF in overnight assays (18–24 h) and hence, under conditions in which GA and MG-132 conferred only limited (GA) or no (MG-132) protection (compare Fig. 1,A and B with G and H). Thus, we redesigned our experimental conditions and looked for an inhibitory effect of neutralizing TNF-specific antibodies in TNF-R1-induced apoptosis triggered by Htr1 in short (8 h) time assays. At this early time point TNF-R1-induced cell death was completely blocked by neutralizing TNF-specific antibodies, demonstrating that endogenously produced TNF has a pivotal role in TNF-R1-dependent apoptosis in Kym-1 cells (Fig.4 A). Geldanamycin blocked the apoptotic effect of TNF concentrations high enough to allow complete occupancy of TNF-R1. It is therefore very unlikely that the endogenously produced TNF exerts its potent enhancement of apoptosis simply by delivering an additional trigger for TNF-R1. Endogenously produced TNF therefore more likely fulfills a function that cannot be readily mediated by soluble TNF. If one takes into consideration that endogenously produced TNF is primarily expressed in its membrane-bound form, such a pro-apoptotic mechanism could reside in the triggering of TNF-R2 and thereby in TRAF2-dependent depletion of anti-apoptotic proteins, as discussed previously (10Chan F.K. Lenardo M.J. Eur. J. Immunol. 2000; 30: 652-660Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11Declercq W. Denecker G. Fiers W. Vandenabeele P. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 390-399PubMed Google Scholar, 12Duckett C.S.

To estimate the amount of TNF-R1-induced TNF in Kym-1 cells, we challenged TNF-R1 with sTNF for 30 min. This short TNF pulse was sufficient to induce complete cell death, albeit with a somewhat reduced efficiency compared with permanent TNF treatment (Fig. 4 B). After removal of this initial TNF-R1 trigger by a pH3 wash or three washes with culture medium, the cells were cultivated for an additional 8 h in the presence of z-VAD-fmk to inhibit apoptosis. The cytotoxic effect of the supernatants was then tested on HT29 cells. HT29 cells were used because in these cells sTNF in combination with IFNγ induces necrosis instead of apoptosis (Ref. 30Nakayama M. Ishidoh K. Kayagaki N. Kojima Y. Yamaguchi N. Nakano H. Kominami E. Okumura K. Yagita H. J. Immunol. 2002; 168: 734-743Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar; own data not shown). As necrosis is not inhibited or even enhanced by caspase-inhibitors (31Vercammen D. Beyaert R. Denecker G. Goossens V. Van Loo G. Declercq W. Grooten J. Fiers W. Vandenabeele P. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 187: 1477-1485Crossref PubMed Scopus (740) Google Scholar, 32Vercammen D. Brouckaert G. Denecker G. van de C.M. Declercq W. Fiers W. Vandenabeele P. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 188: 919-930Crossref PubMed Scopus (467) Google Scholar), HT29 cells are useful in detecting sTNF in the supernatants of cells treated with caspase-inhibitors. Using this assay we found no evidence for bioactive sTNF in the supernatants of z-VAD-fmk-protected, TNF-R1-stimulated Kym-1 cells even at 15 fold concentration (Fig. 4 C). To detect TNF-R1-induced TNF directly, we analyzed supernatants and cell lysates of Htr1-stimulated cells. In accordance with the bioassays described above, only very limited amounts of TNF were found in concentrated supernatants of Htr1-treated cells. In contrast, in detergent-soluble fractions derived from Htr1-treated Kym-1 cells, significant amounts of TNF were detectable (Fig. 4 D). Dependent on the experiment, the detected amount of TNF corresponded to 500–1500 molecules/Kym-1 cell. In accordance with the idea that the cell lysate-associated TNF represents the membrane-bound form of TNF, fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis revealed consistently weak membrane TNF expression after treatment with a mixture of TNF and z-VAD-fmk (Fig. 4 E). Altogether, these findings rule out a relevant contribution of endogenously produced sTNF in TNF-R1-dependent apoptosis and implicate the membrane-bound form of TNF as a critical mediator of rapid TNF-R1-initiated apoptosis. In accordance with a pivotal role for membrane TNF and TNF-R2 signaling in TNF-R1-triggered apoptosis, we found that costimulation of both TNF receptors is sufficient to induce apoptosis in the presence of GA or neutralizing TNF-specific antibodies (Fig. 4 F). As shown above (Fig. 4 A), a short pulse of sTNF is sufficient to induce apoptosis independently of the presence of exogenous sTNF. However, this holds only true for cells responding upon TNF-R1 stimulation with TNF production. For example, HeLa-TNF-R2 cells, which are not capable of producing TNF after TNF-R1 triggering (data not shown) but express high numbers of TNF-R2 (14Weiss T. Grell M. Hessabi B. Bourteele S. Muller G. Scheurich P. Wajant H. J. Immunol. 1997; 158: 2398-2404PubMed Google Scholar), required prolonged exposure to sTNF (3–8 h) for significant induction of cell death (Fig.5 A) and activation of caspase-8 (Fig. 5 B). In accordance with the lack of sTNF-induced TNF production in HeLa-TNF-R2 cells, GA failed to inhibit TNF-R1-dependent cell death in these cells (Fig.5 C). Importantly, a short pulse with sTNF was sufficient to induce I-κB degradation (Fig. 5 D) and DNA binding of NF-κB (Fig. 5 E). Consequently, a TNF pulse activated a NF-κB reporter gene and induced the NF-κB target, IL-6, almost as efficiently as under conditions in which sTNF was present during the whole assay (Fig. 5 A). These data indicate that in HeLa cells the rapid activation of gene-inducing pathways (NF-κB) is normal. Thus, the possibility arises that the formation of apoptosis-competent TNF-R1 signaling complexes is a secondary, rather ineffective event occurring only with time after the predominant formation of non-apoptotic gene-inductive receptor signaling complexes. However, the formation of pro-apoptotic TNF-R1 signaling complexes can be facilitated by memTNF/TNF-R2-dependent depletion of TRAF2 and TRAF2-interacting anti-apoptotic factors (Fig.6).Figure 6Model of TNF receptor co-operation in rapid TNF-R1-initiated apoptosis of Kym-1 cells. “Primary” events (solid lines): selective stimulation of TNF-R1 by soluble TNF or agonistic antibodies (1) results in the NF-κB-dependent (2) induction of TNF (3b) and anti-apoptotic factors (3a). The TNF-R1-induced, and possibly already existing, anti-apoptotic factors (e.g. IAPs) interact with TRAF2 (3a-1) and block TNF-R1-induced apoptosis (3a-2). “Secondary” events (dotted lines): the endogenously produced TNF acts primarily in its membrane-bound form (3b-1) and can therefore stimulate TNF-R1 and more importantly TNF-R2 (3b-2). As a consequence of the stimulation of the TRAF2-interacting receptor TNF-R2 by endogenous membrane TNF (3b-3), the anti-apoptotic TRAF2-containing complex is deviated from TNF-R1, and the aforementioned block on TNF-R1-dependent apoptosis is released (3b-4). Because of the pivotal role of TNF-R2 stimulation by endogenously produced membrane TNF, reagents interfering with its action (A, GA and Mg-123 by inhibiting its production; B, anti TNF by blocking its action) strongly inhibit rapid TNF-R1-induced apoptosis. Please note that with extended incubation times TNF-R1 stimulation alone, without the support of TNF-R2, can also induce apoptosis.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Based on the aforementioned experimental data and data from the literature, we propose the following model of rapid TNF-R1-induced apoptosis (Fig. 6). Exclusive stimulation of TNF-R1 by soluble TNF or TNF-R1-specific agonistic antibodies leads to activation of the NF-κB pathway. Among the NF-κB-induced target genes in Kym-1 cells are the anti-apoptotic factors cIAP2 and TRAF1 (data not shown) but also the TNF gene itself (Fig. 3). Newly produced (e.g. cIAP2 and eventually TRAF1) and already existing (e.g. cIAP1) anti-apoptotic factors form a complex with TRAF2 (24Wang C.Y. Mayo M.W. Korneluk R.G. Goeddel D.V. Baldwin Jr., A.S. Science. 1998; 281: 1680-1683Crossref PubMed Scopus (2566) Google Scholar, 33Fotin-Mleczek M. Henkler F. Samel D. Reichwein M. Hausser A. Parmryd I. Scheurich P. Schmid J.A. Wajant H. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 2757-2770Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). By virtue of the capability of TRAF2 (and eventually TRAF1) to interact with TNF-R1-bound TRADD, this complex translocates to the TNF-R1 signaling complex, thus preventing the proteolytic activation of procaspase-8 (24Wang C.Y. Mayo M.W. Korneluk R.G. Goeddel D.V. Baldwin Jr., A.S. Science. 1998; 281: 1680-1683Crossref PubMed Scopus (2566) Google Scholar). However, in TNF-R2-expressing cells that respond, with the up-regulation of TNF, to TNF-R1 triggering, the protective effect of the TRAF·IAP complex becomes secondarily compromised. As the endogenously produced TNF occurs primarily in its membrane-bound form (Fig. 4), it has the capability to stimulate TNF-R2 in an autocrine/paracrine manner. The importance of TNF-R2 stimulation by endogenously produced membrane TNF is reflected by the fact that reagents interfering with the action of membrane-bound TNF strongly inhibit rapid TNF-R1-induced apoptosis (Figs. 1 and 4 A). However, there is no absolute requirement for endogenous membrane-bound TNF to induce cell death, because Kym-1 cells undergo apoptosis even in the presence of GA after stimulation with soluble TNF for 24 h (Fig. 1 B). Therefore, endogenous TNF enhances and accelerates TNF-R1-induced cell death but is not absolutely essential to it. According to our model, the pro-apoptotic action of TNF-R2 relies on the capability of this receptor to recruit the aforementioned anti-apoptotic TRAF·IAP complex. As a consequence of the competition of TNF-R1 and TNF-R2 for the TRAF2-dependent recruitment of the anti-apoptotic TRAF·IAP complex, the availability of the latter for TNF-R1 is reduced (33Fotin-Mleczek M. Henkler F. Samel D. Reichwein M. Hausser A. Parmryd I. Scheurich P. Schmid J.A. Wajant H. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 2757-2770Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, the blockage on procaspase-8 processing in the TNF-R1 signaling complex is relieved and the apoptotic pathway can be triggered. TRAF2-dependent competition for IAP proteins can be effective only when these proteins are of limited availability. Indeed, Western blot analysis of endogenous and green fluorescent protein-tagged recombinant IAP proteins suggest that in Kym-1 cells, even after TNF-R1-induced up-regulation, only a few thousand of these molecules are expressed per cell (data not shown). It has been shown recently that cIAP1 can act as an E3 ligase upon recruitment into the TNF-R2 signaling complex, triggering the proteasomal degradation of TRAF2 (34Li X. Yang Y. Ashwell J.D. Nature. 2002; 416: 345-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar). Thus, this process might intensify the competition of the TNF receptors for the anti-apoptotic TRAF·IAP complex. In cells not responding with TNF production toward TNF-R1 stimulation, apoptosis-induction, but not NF-κB activation, can be dependent on the prolonged presence of exogenous TNF (Fig. 5). Thus, it is tempting to speculate that endogenously produced TNF can also exert a pro-apoptotic effect in the absence of TNF-R2 by facilitating cell-autonomous prolonged TNF-R1 triggering. In conclusion, our study reveals a novel mechanism by which TNF-R1, TNF-R2, and endogenously produced membrane TNF act jointly to circumvent the need for the prolonged presence of exogenous soluble TNF for efficient apoptosis induction.

FIX contains an N-terminal Gla domain followed by two epidermal growth factor-like (EGF) domains and a serine protease domain. In this study, the epitope of monoclonal antibody AW, which is directed against the C-terminal part of the first EGF domain in human FIX, was defined, and the antibody was used to study interactions between the EGF domain of FIX and other coagulation proteins. Antibody AW completely blocks activation of FIX by activated factor XI, but activation by activated factor FVII-tissue factor is inhibited only slightly. The antibody also causes a marginal reduction in the apparentk cat for factor X both in the presence and absence of activated factor VIII. Based on these results, we produced a preliminary model of the structure of the activated factor IX-activated factor VIII-AW complex on the surface of phospholipid. The model suggests that in the Xase complex, EGF1 of activated factor IX is not involved in direct binding to activated factor VIII. Studies of the interaction of antibody AW with a mutated FIX molecule (R94D) also suggest that the Glu78–Arg94 salt bridge is not important for maintaining the structure of FIX.

FIX circulates in plasma as a zymogen that is converted to a serine protease either by activated factor VII (FVIIa) in complex with tissue factor (TF) or by activated factor XI (FXIa). Activation of FIX is a two-step process in which an activation peptide is proteolytically removed by sequential cleavages at Arg145 (generating the nonactive FIXα) and Arg180 to form FIXaβ (commonly referred to as FIXa) (1Lindquist P. Fujikawa K. Davie E. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 1902-1909Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 2Davie E.W. Fujikawa K. Kisiel W. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 10363-10370Crossref PubMed Scopus (1636) Google Scholar). FIXa interacts with its cofactor, activated factor VIII (FVIIIa), to form a membrane-bound macromolecular complex called Xase, which activates factor X (FX) to form FXa. FIX has the same modular structure as its homologues, FVII, FX, and protein C, including an N-terminal domain in which 12 glutamyl residues are post-translationally modified in a vitamin K-dependent reaction to form γ-carboxyglutamate (Gla) (3Stenflo J. Suttie J.W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1977; 46: 157-172Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 4Furie B. Bouchard B.A. Furie B.C. Blood. 1999; 93: 1798-1808Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The Gla residues are crucial for Ca2+ binding and for interaction of FIX/FIXa with biological membranes. The Gla domain is followed by two epidermal growth factor-like (EGF) domains (EGF1 comprises residues 46–84, and EGF2 comprises residues 85–127) and the serine protease domain, which occupies the C-terminal half of the molecule. The three-dimensional structure of full-length porcine FIXa, as determined by x-ray crystallography, portrays an extended molecule in which the phospholipid-interacting Gla domain is remote from the serine protease domain (5Brandsetter H. Bauer M. Huber R. Lollar P. Bode W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9796-9800Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). Whereas the structure was determined in the absence of Ca2+, it is known that EGF1 binds a single Ca2+ by means of the ligands Asp47, Gly48, Gln50, Asp64, and Asp65 in the N-terminal part of the domain (Fig. 1) (6Rao Z. Handford P. Mayhew M. Knott V. Brownlee G.G. Stuart D. Cell. 1995; 82: 131-141Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). Synthetic EGF1 binds Ca2+ with a K D of 1.8 mm, but when linked to the Gla domain, the affinity increases about 10-fold (K D = 0.16 mm) (7Handford P.A. Mayhew M. Baron M. Winship P.R. Campbell I.D. Brownlee G.G. Nature. 1991; 351: 164-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar, 8Persson K.E.M. Astermark J. Björk I. Stenflo J. FEBS Lett. 1998; 421: 100-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Hence, the site is essentially saturated at physiological concentrations of extracellular free Ca2+. The Ca2+ ion locks the Gla domain relative to EGF1 in a manner that is commensurate with biological activity. The C-terminal part of EGF1 seems to interact with EGF2 by forming hydrophobic interactions and a salt bridge between Glu78 and Arg94 (5Brandsetter H. Bauer M. Huber R. Lollar P. Bode W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9796-9800Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar,9Christophe O.D. Lenting P.J. Kolkman J.A. Brownlee G.G. Mertens K. J. Biol.

Chem. 2000; 275: 229-234Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). EGF2 is in close contact with the serine protease domain and is probably required for proper orientation and folding of the latter. Several point mutations in the EGF domains give rise to hemophilia (11Giannelli F. Green P.M. Sommer S.S. Poon M.-C. Ludwig M. Schwaab R. Reitsma P.H. Goossens M. Yoshioka A. Figueiredo M.S. Brownlee G.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 265-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). The activation of FIX by FVIIa·TF or FXIa and the activation of FX by FIXa-FVIIIa involve a wealth of functionally important protein-protein interactions. For instance, the interaction of membrane-bound FVIIIa with FIXa to form the Xase complex increases theV max for FX activation by several orders of magnitude (12van Dieijen G. Tans G. Rosing J. Hemker H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 3433-3442Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Three-dimensional structures of FIXa and molecular models of FVIIIa (based on its homology with ceruloplasmin) have allowed preliminary models of the FIXa-FVIIIa complex to be constructed (13Stoilova-McPhie S. Villoutreix B.O. Mertens K Kemball-Cook G. Holzenburg A. Blood. 2002; 99: 1215-1223Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 14Celie P.H.N. van Stempvoort G. Fribourg C. Schurgers L.J. Lenting P.J. Mertens K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 20214-20220Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). These models accommodate the well established facts that the Gla domain of FIXa and the C2 domain of FVIIIa interact with biological membranes. Site-directed mutagenesis studies have also shed light on the FIXa-FVIIIa interaction and indicate that the serine protease domain is the most important part of FIXa to mediate the interaction with FVIIIa. For example, the helix formed by residues 330–338 of the serine protease domain (residues 162–170 in the chymotrypsinogen numbering scheme) interacts with the A2 domain of FVIIIa (15Mathur A. Bajaj S.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 18477-18486Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 16Kolkman J.A. Lenting P.J. Mertens K. Biochem. J. 1999; 339: 217-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). It is clear that EGF domains function as spacers to position the active site of FIX/FIXa and related coagulation proteases at a suitable distance from the biological membrane for interaction with activators, cofactors, and substrates. EGF domains also contribute directly to certain protein interactions, as in the case of the interaction of EGF1 of FIX with FVIIa·TF (17Zhong D. Bajaj M.S. Schmidt A.E. Bajaj S.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 3622-3631Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Attempts to establish the role of EGF1 of FIXa in FX activation and, more specifically, whether there is a direct interaction between EGF1 and membrane-bound FVIIIa have been inconclusive. For instance, recombinant mosaic FIXa, with EGF1 substituted for the corresponding domain of FX, has full biological activity (19Lin S.W. Smith K.J. Welsch D. Stafford D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 144-150Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). On the other hand, Ca2+ binding to EGF1 of FIX has been reported to promote binding of the FVIIIa light chain and enhance amidolytic activity and FX activation (18Lenting P.J. Christophe O.D. ter Maat H. Rees J.G. Mertens K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25332-25337Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The effect on the amidolytic activity indicates that Ca2+-binding to EGF1 causes a reorientation of the Gla domain relative to EGF1 and that the ensuing conformational change is propagated by alterations to the inter-EGF1-EGF2 angle and thence the hydrophobic interface between EGF2 and the serine protease domain. Similar conformational transitions occur between the N-terminal EGF domain and the serine protease domain in FVII (20Leonard B.J.N. Clarke B.J. Sridhara S. Kelley R. Ofosu F.A. Blajchman M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 34894-34900Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). In this study, we have characterized a mouse monoclonal antibody (mAb), AW, and found residues Trp72 and Lys80 to be crucial parts of the epitope, with an indirect contribution from Phe75 and minor contacts with Pro55 and Arg94. The mAb and its Fab fragment have a 10-fold lowerK D for FIXa than for FIX, supporting the notion that conformational transitions in the EGF1 and serine protease domains are linked during activation of FIX (21Persson K.E.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 286: 1039-1044Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). The mAb inhibits FXIa-mediated activation of FIX but only modestly reduces the FVIIa-TF-mediated activation. When FIXa is bound in the Xase complex, the mAb causes a marginal reduction in the apparent k cat(k cat (app)) for FX, and this reduction is also present in the absence of FVIIIa. Molecular modeling of a Fab fragment bound to FIXa-FVIIIa indicates that the Fab can be accommodated within the complex without sterically interfering FVIIIa and, hence, provides evidence for a model in which the EGF1 domain of FIXa is not in contact with FVIIIa (13Stoilova-McPhie S.

(Essex Junction, VT). Human FXIa was from Kordia (Leiden, The Netherlands). FVIIa was a gift from Novo Nordisk (Copenhagen, Denmark). Recombinant human wild-type FIX and mutated forms (D49E, P55S, R94D, and E245K) were produced in human kidney 293 cells as described previously (21Persson K.E.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 286: 1039-1044Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Primers used to introduce the R94D mutation were 5′-GAACTGTGAATTAGATGTAACATGTAACATTAAGAATGGCGATTGCGAGCAGTTTTG-3′ and 5′-CCTTGTTATCAGCACTATTTTTACAAAACTGCTCGCAATCGCCATTCTTAATGTTAC-3′, and primers for the E245K mutation were 5′-GAGGAGACAGAACATACAAAGCAAAAGCGAAATGTGATTCG-3′ and 5′-CGAATCACATTTCGCTTTTGCTTTGTATGTTCTGTCTCCTC-3′. For characterization of the recombinant proteins, clotting assays were performed using plasma-derived FIX as a reference. The samples were serially diluted from 75 to 1.2 nm with 1% (w/v) human serum albumin, 0.1 m NaCl, 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, and clotting was induced with an APTT reagent as described below. Activation of wild-type FIX (2 μm), plasma-derived FIX, and FIX P55S by FXIa (68 nm) was carried out at 37 °C for 2 h in 20 mm Hepes, 0.15 m NaCl, 5 mm CaCl2, pH 7.4. Activation was visualized by SDS-PAGE, using 12% (w/v) gels stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250 (22Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-684Crossref PubMed Scopus (207538) Google Scholar). EGF1 of human FIX (amino acids 46–84), biotinylated at the N terminus, was synthesized in a Milligen 9050 Plus Synthesizer (Applied Biosystems) using standard Fmoc (N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl) chemistry. It was purified by HPLC and folded as described (23Stenberg Y. Julenius K. Dahlqvist I. Drakenberg T. Stenflo J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 248: 163-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Five mutated EGF1 domains (L57Q, S61M, W72F, F75A, and K80T) were synthesized in the same manner except that the W72F domain was not biotinylated. N-terminal sequences were determined on an Applied Biosystems 494 Procise Sequencer (Foster City, CA). Protein concentrations were determined by amino acid analysis of acid hydrolysates as previously described (24Stenberg Y. Drakenberg T. Dahlbäck B. Stenflo J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 251: 558-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Gla contents were measured following alkaline hydrolysis as described (21Persson K.E.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 286: 1039-1044Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Folding of the EGF domains was investigated using reduced (dithiothreitol/iodoacetamide) and nonreduced proteins in an ELISA as described below with the mAb AW or polyclonal rabbit anti-human FIX antiserum (DAKO, Glostrup, Denmark) as the primary antibody. AW is a non-Ca2+-dependent mouse monoclonal antibody of the IgG1κ isotype directed against human FIX (21Persson K.E.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 286: 1039-1044Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar,25Wallmark A. Ljung R. Nilsson I.M. Holmberg L. Hedner U. Lindvall M. Sjögren H.-O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 3839-3843Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). HPC11 is a monoclonal antibody directed against protein C. 2J. Stenflo, unpublished observations. ELISA was performed as described previously (21Persson K.E.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 286: 1039-1044Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). In brief, proteins were coated on 96-well microtiter plates followed by the addition of mAb AW or a polyclonal rabbit anti-human FIX antiserum (DAKO). Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated rabbit anti-mouse or goat anti-rabbit antiserum (DAKO) was employed for detection. The assay was performed as described (21Persson K.E.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 286: 1039-1044Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). In brief, mAb AW was coated on a microtiter plate, and a solution containing a constant amount of Eu3+-labeled human FIXa and different dilutions of unlabeled synthetic wild-type or W72F EGF domain was added to the plates. After incubation, the plates were washed and incubated with enhancement solution, and the fluorescence was measured in a fluorometer (DELFIA, Wallac Oy, Finland). Proteolysis of intact mAb AW was performed according to Parham (26Parham P. Cellular Immunology. 4th Ed. Blackwell Scientific Publications, New York1986: 14.1-14.22Google Scholar) with some modifications. mAb AW (in 0.1 m sodium citrate, pH 3.5) was digested with 0.5% (w/w) pepsin at 37 °C for 1 h, and then the pH was adjusted to 7.5 with 2 m Tris, and the solution was dialyzed against 0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.5. Cysteine was added to a final concentration of 0.01 m, and the mixture was incubated at 37 °C for 2 h. Iodoacetamide was added to a final concentration of 0.015 m, and after incubation at room temperature for 30 min, the sample was dialyzed against 0.02m Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, and the Fab fragment was isolated by chromatography on Q-Sepharose. Plasma (100 μl) from healthy individuals or from a FIX-deficient patient (FIX <1%) was incubated for 15 min at room temperature with 2 μm mAb AW or its Fab fragment diluted in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing 0.1m NaCl and 1% (w/v) human serum albumin. The plasma was then mixed with 100 μl of thromboplastin reagent (Sigma) or 100 μl of APTT reagent (Diagnostica Stago, Asnieres-Sur-Seine, France). After incubation for 5 min at 37 °C, 100 μl of 0.025 mCaCl2 was added, and the clotting time was recorded with a KC 10, Amelung (Germany). Each experiment was repeated twice. A 50-μl aliquot of FIXa (final concentration 2 μm) in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.4, containing 10 mm CaCl2, 0.1m NaCl, and 0.2% (w/v) bovine serum albumin was mixed with 50 μl of FIXa substrate CH3SO2-LGR-pNA (CBS 31.39; Diagnostica Stago) in a Sero-Wel 96-well plate (Bibby Sterilin Ltd., Stone, Staffs, UK). A 405 at 37 °C was recorded for 15 min. Antithrombin (2 μm) and heparin (800 IU/ml) were added to the assay, with or without 10 μm mAb AW. FIXa and FXa (2 μm)were active site-titrated as described by Byrne et al. (27Byrne R. Link R.P. Castellino F.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 5336-5341Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) in a Cary 4E spectrophotometer (Varian Pty. Ltd, Mulgrave, Australia) using a concentration ofp-nitrophenyl-p′-guanidinobenzoate of 50 μm. Human FIX (2 μm) was incubated at 37 °C with human FXIa (68 nm) in 20 mmHepes, 0.15 m NaCl, 5 mm CaCl2, pH 7.4. In some assays, FIX was preincubated for 5 min with 8 μm mAb HPC 11 or 8 μm Fab fragments of AW. Aliquots were withdrawn at intervals; diluted 1:5 in 0.05 mTris-HCl, pH 8.4, containing 0.1 m NaCl, 10 mmCaCl2, and 0.2% (w/v) human serum albumin; and then frozen on dry ice/ethanol and stored at −70 °C. Thawed samples were mixed with an equal volume of CH3SO2-LGR-pNA (Diagnostica Stago), and the A405 was recorded for 15 min at 37 °C. Human FIX (1.6 μm) was incubated at 37 °C with human FVIIa (0.3 nm) in 0.1 m NaCl, 5 mmCaCl2, 0.05 m Tris, pH 8.4. In some assays, FIX was preincubated for 5 min with 8 μm mAb HPC 11 or 8 μm Fab fragments of mAb AW. The mixture was diluted 1:2 with Innovine (recombinant tissue factor; Dade Behring, Marburg, Germany), and aliquots were removed at intervals and diluted 1:2.6 in 0.05 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.4, containing 0.1 m NaCl, 5 mm CaCl2, and 0.2% (w/v) human serum albumin. The aliquots were frozen in dry ice/ethanol and stored at −70 °C. Thawed samples were diluted 1:1 with CH3SO2-LGR-pNA (Diagnostica Stago), and theA 405 was monitored for 15 min at 37 °C. Phospholipid vesicles containing 70% l-α-phosphatidylcholine (Sigma) and 30% phosphatidyl-l-serine (ICN; Aurora, OH) were prepared as described (28Astermark J. Stenflo J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 2438-2443Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and added to a final concentration of 50 μm in a buffer consisting of 20 mm Hepes, 0.2% (w/v) human serum albumin, 0.15 m NaCl, 10 mm CaCl2, pH 7.4, and incubated for 10 min at 37 °C. Active site-titrated FIXa was then added to a concentration of 0.1 nm. In some assays 0.1 μm mAb AW or its Fab fragment was included, and the antibody and FIXa were preincubated for 5 min. Thrombin (6.4 nm; Kordia) and FVIIIa (9.4 nm; Recombinate, Baxter, Germany) were added, and the mixture was incubated at 37 °C for 2 min. FX was then added; aliquots were withdrawn after 0, 5, 10, and 15 s (when formation of FXa was linear); and the reaction was stopped by the addition of an equal amount of 20 mm Hepes, 0.15 m NaCl, 25 mm EDTA, pH 7.4. A 100-μl aliquot of S-2222 (Chromogenix, Milano, Italy) was added to 100 μl of the reaction mixture, andA 405 was recorded for 15 min at 37 °C. An active site-titrated FXa preparation was used as a reference to convert absorbance values into molar concentrations. For assays performed in the absence of FVIIIa or phospholipid, 10 nm FIXa and 18.7 nm FVIIIa were used, both with and without 1 μm mAb AW. In this case, the mixture was incubated for 11 min before the addition of FX. Aliquots were withdrawn after 0, 10, 15, and 30 s for assays without phospholipid and after 0, 1, 2, and 5 min for assays in the absence of FVIIIa (when formation of FXa was linear). In the absence of both FVIIIa and phospholipid, the concentration of FIXa was increased to 400 nm (in the presence and absence of 4 μm mAb AW), and 1 μm FX was used. Aliquots were withdrawn after 5, 10, 20, 30, and 45 min. The interaction of FIX and FIXa with mAb AW or its Fab fragment was analyzed with a BIACORE 2000 biosensor (Biacore AB, Uppsala, Sweden). The mAb AW or its Fab fragment was immobilized on a CM5 sensor chip using an amine coupling kit (Biacore AB) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Association and dissociation rates were determined at a flow rate of 30 μl/min at 25 °C. About 1500 response units of whole mAb and 600 response units of Fab fragment were immobilized on the chip. Proteins were diluted in a buffer containing 150 mm NaCl, 10 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 5 mmCaCl2, and an aliquot of 90 μl was injected for 180 s, followed by the same buffer for 600 s. 2-Fold dilutions of protein over the range 50–1.6 nm were tested. Sensor chips were regenerated with a 5-μl pulse (5 μl/min) of 0.1 mglycine, 0.5 m NaCl, pH 2.7. One channel on the chip without coupled antibody was used for correction of the bulk sample effect. Data were evaluated with BIAevaluation 3.0 software, and dissociation constants were calculated from the association and dissociation rate constants. Each experiment was repeated twice. A three-dimensional structural model of FVIII was obtained from the World Wide Web at europium.csc.mrc.ac.uk (13Stoilova-McPhie S. Villoutreix B.O. Mertens K Kemball-Cook G. Holzenburg A. Blood. 2002; 99: 1215-1223Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). X-ray coordinates for full-length porcine FIXa (file 1pfx.pdb), the human FIXa EGF2-serine protease domain (file 1rfn.pdb), the FVIIa-TF complex (file 1dan.pdb), and a Fab fragment in complex with TF (file 1ahw.pdb) were obtained from the Protein Data Bank (available on the World Wide Web at www.rcsb.org/pdb) (5Brandsetter H.

Wilson I.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 275: 873-894Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). A model of full-length human FIXa was built using the coordinates for the human FIXa EGF2-serine protease domain and porcine FIXa. Certain side chains in the porcine Gla-EGF1 region were substituted for those corresponding to human FIX. Ca2+ ions were added according to the FVIIa x-ray structure. Angles between the different domains of porcine FIXa were kept in the human FIXa model. Possible variations in the Gla-EGF1 and EGF1-EGF2 interdomain angles were taken into account in subsequent structural analysis, whereas the EGF2-serine protease interface was assumed to be relatively rigid. Coordinates for the Fab fragment were extracted from file 1ahw, and the hypervariable loop regions were positioned on top of the expected epitope for mAb AW. Positioning of the Fab took into account only the overall shape complementarity between FIXa and the Fab structure; a full docking protocol could not be performed, since the amino acid sequence of mAb AW is not known. An approximate model for the FIXa-Fab complex was then positioned next to the FVIIIa model using information previously reported for FVIIIa, and further optimization of the system was performed interactively (13Stoilova-McPhie S. Villoutreix B.O. Mertens K Kemball-Cook G. Holzenburg A. Blood. 2002; 99: 1215-1223Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar,32Bajaj S.P. Schmidt A.E. Mathur A. Padmanabhan K. Zhong D. Mastri M.

Modeling and structural analysis were performed on Silicon Graphics O2 and FUEL workstations (Mountain View, CA) with the Accelrys package (available on the World Wide Web at www.accelrys.com; Accelrys, San Diego, CA). Visualization of the molecules during positioning was facilitated by the use of Stereo devices (Crystaleyes). Wild-type FIX and four variants containing the point substitutions D49E or P55S (in EGF1), R94D (in EGF2), and E245K (in the serine protease domain; residue 80, chymotrypsinogen numbering) were produced in human kidney 293 cells and used in initial attempts to define the epitope of mAb AW (see below; Figs.1 and 2) (21Persson K.E.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 286: 1039-1044Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). The P55S, R94S, and E245K mutations have been found in hemophilia B patients (11Giannelli F. Green P.M. Sommer S.S. Poon M.-C. Ludwig M. Schwaab R. Reitsma P.H. Goossens M. Yoshioka A. Figueiredo M.S. Brownlee G.G.

The affinity-purified proteins were more than 95% homogeneous as judged by N-terminal sequencing and SDS-PAGE, and there were no signs of internal cleavages. Amino acid analysis of alkaline hydrolysates established that the FIX preparations were almost fully γ-carboxylated (12.4 mol of Gla/mol of FIX for plasma-derived FIX, 11.1 mol/mol for the recombinant wild-type protein, and 10.5 mol/mol for the mutated proteins). Clotting activities (mean of two or three measurements) were 100% for plasma-derived FIX and 96% for recombinant wild-type FIX. Those for the variants were D49E (18%), P55S (12%), R94D (100%), and E245K (<1%). The wild-type and P55S FIX proteins could be almost fully activated by FXIa at rates comparable with plasma-derived FIX, as analyzed by SDS-PAGE (not shown). The synthetic wild-type and variant FIX EGF1 domains each produced a single peak during reversed-phase HPLC on a C8 column and were judged to be folded to a native conformation; an ELISA using a polyclonal rabbit anti-human FIX antiserum was positive with the folded EGF1 domains but negative after reduction of disulfide bonds (not shown; the antiserum does not react with reduced FIX). Moreover, synthetic EGF1 has been shown to have the same affinity as FIXa for mAb AW (21Persson K.E.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 286: 1039-1044Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Recombinant FIX variants and synthetic FIX EGF1 domains containing amino acid substitutions were used to define the epitope of mAb AW. Synthetic human FIX EGF1 and FIXa bound to mAb AW with the same affinity, whereas bovine FIX did not, although within EGF1 the bovine protein differs at only four positions (61, 74, 75 and 80; Fig. 1 and Ref. 21Persson K.E.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 286: 1039-1044Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). We therefore synthesized human EGF1 with the following substitutions: S61M, F75A, and K80T. The substitution L57Q was also made to probe the surface of the face of EGF1 that is opposite to Lys80 (see below; Fig. 2). Notably, FX and FVII have a Gln residue in the corresponding position. When tested in an ELISA, the L57Q and S61M domains bound both mAb AW and polyclonal anti-FIX antibodies with the same affinity as the wild-type domain. Domains with F75A and K80T substitutions did not bind the mAb (Fig. 3, A andB). Two full-length recombinant FIX variants (R94D and E245K) were also tested by ELISA (Fig. 3, C andD). The E245K mutation, which is located in the Ca2+-binding loop of the serine protease domain (34Hamaguchi N. Stafford D. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1994; 72: 856-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar), was chosen because we wanted to investigate whether the mAb could interact with a region close to the activation peptide. The R94D substitution was selected, since it could give an indication of the importance of the inter-EGF1-EGF2 area for binding of mAb AW. Both mAb AW and the polyclonal antiserum bound to FIX E245K as strongly as to wild-type FIX, whereas mAb AW bound the R94D variant with slightly lower affinity. Full-length FIX D49E and P55S variants have been tested previously and found to have only a slightly lower affinity for mAb AW than wild-type FIX (21Persson K.E.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 286: 1039-1044Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Synthetic EGF1 W72F was produced and tested in a comp"

We used immunoprecipitation and mass spectrometric analysis to identify MLK2-binding proteins in cell lines with inducible expression of green fluorescent protein-tagged MLK2. Here we report the identification of clathrin as a binding partner for MLK2 in both cultured cells and mammalian brain. We demonstrate that clathrin binding requires a motif (LLDMD) located near the MLK2 C terminus, which is similar to “clathrin box” motifs important for binding of clathrin coat assembly and accessory proteins to the clathrin heavy chain. A C-terminal fragment of MLK2 containing this motif binds strongly to clathrin, and mutation of the LLDMD sequence to LAAAD completely abrogates clathrin binding. We isolated clathrin-coated vesicles from green fluorescent protein-MLK2-expressing cells and from mouse brain lysates and found that MLK2 is enriched along with clathrin in these vesicles. In addition, we demonstrated that endogenous MLK2 co-immunoprecipitates with clathrin heavy chain from the vesicle-enriched fraction of mouse brain lysate. Furthermore, overexpression of MLK2 in cultured cells inhibits accumulation of labeled transferrin in recycling endosomes during receptor-mediated endocytosis.

Like other mitogen-activated protein kinases, JNK is the final member of a three-kinase cascade in which sequential phosphorylation events transmit signals from upstream activators to the nucleus to initiate gene transcription (4Davis R.J. Biochem. Soc. Symp. 1999; 64: 1-12PubMed Google Scholar). JNKs are activated by dual phosphorylation on threonine and tyrosine by MAP kinase kinases (MAP2Ks), MKK4 and MKK7, that are in turn activated by a number of MAP3Ks including MLK family members (2Hirai S.

The three sequential kinases in a given cascade form a signaling module that responds to a specific set of stimuli to initiate cellular events. In addition to transcription factors, JNKs phosphorylate a diverse range of proteins (6Shanavas A. Papasozomenos S.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

MLKs 1–3 each contain a set of highly conserved structural domains associated with protein interactions and signal transduction including an Src homology 3 (SH3) domain (16Koch C.A. Anderson D. Moran M.F. Ellis C. Pawson T. Science. 1991; 252: 668-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (1438) Google Scholar), a kinase catalytic domain, two leucine zipper (LeuZip) motifs (17Landschultz W.H. Johnson P.F.

Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29071-29074Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (557) Google Scholar). In addition, each has a unique N-terminal peptide and a large C-terminal domain rich in serine, threonine, and proline but with reduced amino acid similarity among the three proteins. The more distantly related members retain much of the overall MLK family structure but lack an SH3 domain and share a lower level of amino acid conservation with MLKs 1–3. Although all are activators of the stress-signaling pathway, little is known about their modes of activation, and their physiological roles in mammalian cells are just beginning to be revealed. One of the MLK proteins, MLK2, is expressed at high levels in human brain, skeletal muscle, and testis (11Dorow D.S. Devereux L., Tu, G.-F. Price G. Nicholl J.K. Sutherland G.R. Simpson R.J. Eur. J.

Chem. 2001; 276: 11382-11386Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar), a member of the membrane-associated guanylate kinase protein family involved in formation of multiprotein signaling complexes at synapses, cellular junctions, and polarized membrane domains (24Fanning A.S. Anderson J.M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 432-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). PSD-95 anchors MLK2 to a complex with the kainate receptor, GluR6, in neuronal cells (22Savinainen A. Garcia E.P. Dorow D. Marshall J. Liu Y.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 11382-11386Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar), and expression of a dominant-negative MLK2 mutant (DN-MLK2) inhibits kainic acid signaling in this cellular system. Furthermore, the MLK2-SH3 domain binds to and activates the GTPase, dynamin (23Rasmussen R.K. Rusak J. Price G. Robinson P.J. Simpson R.J. Dorow D.S. Biochem. J. 1998; 335: 119-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), that is involved in vesicle formation during receptor-mediated endocytosis, neurotransmission, and Golgi transport (reviewed in Ref. 25Danino D.

Stull J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 32529-32530Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Further interaction studies reveal that the three members of the MLK to JNK signaling module, MLKs 2, 3, or DLK, together with MKK7 and JNK, bind a set of scaffold proteins, JNK-interacting proteins (JIPs) (30Yasuda J. Whitmarsh A.J. Cavanagh J. Sharma M. Davis R.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7245-7254Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar). The JIP scaffolding interactions serve to modulate, and possibly direct, signaling within the MLK/JNK cascade (30Yasuda J. Whitmarsh A.J. Cavanagh J. Sharma M. Davis R.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7245-7254Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar, 31Tawadros T. Formenton A. Dudler J. Thompson N. Nicod P. Leisinger H.J. Waeber G. Haefliger J.A. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 385-393PubMed Google Scholar). JIPs also bind apoER2, the neuronal receptor for reelin (32Stockinger W. Brandes C. Fasching D. Hermann M. Gotthardt M. Herz J. Schneider W.J. Nimpf J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25625-25632Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar), a molecule required for correct positioning of neurons during development. In addition, JIPs bind kinesin motor proteins, and a complex of kinesin, JIP, DLK, and apoER2 can be precipitated by addition of stabilized microtubules to a high speed supernatant fraction of rat brain lysate (33Verhey K.J. Meyer D. Deehan R. Blenis J. Schnapp B.J. Rapoport T.A. Margolis B. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 959-970Crossref PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar). These results led to the suggestion that the DLK-MKK7-JNK signaling module is pre-assembled onto JIP together with an apoER2-containing vesicle and that the entire complex is transported along microtubules to potential sites of activity. A separate study of the JIP-DLK interaction revealed that JIP binding holds DLK in an inactive monomeric form and that upon release from JIP, DLK dimerizes, thereby becoming active (34Nihalani D. Meyer D. Pajni S. Holzman L.B. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 3447-3458Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Thus, vesicle transport and receptor signaling activities can be coordinated through scaffold interactions of the MLK-JNK signaling module with JIP. However, the exact functional outcome of this coordination remains to be defined. Recently, we established a role for MLK2 in stress-related apoptosis in neuronal cells. Thus, MLK2 activation of the JNK pathway is required for HN33 neuronal cell apoptosis in response to expression of glutamine-expanded huntingtin, the mutant product of the Huntington's disease gene (35Liu Y.F. Dorow D. Marshall J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19035-19040Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The SH3 domain of MLK2 binds normal huntingtin protein, and the polyglutamine expansion associated with Huntington's disease blocks the interaction. Expression of DN-MLK2 inhibits the apoptotic response to mutated huntingtin in these cells. As MLK2 expression is not limited to neuronal cells, it is likely to have functional roles in a number of biologically relevant settings. To identify such roles for MLK2 in mammalian cells, we created cell lines with inducible expression of GFP-tagged MLK2. We report here that MLK2 binds to clathrin heavy chain (CHC) and is enriched in clathrin-coated vesicles (CCVs) in cultured cells and in murine brain. In addition, overexpression of MLK2 in cultured cells inhibits endocytic function. Taken together with previous findings of MLK2 interactions with endocytic regulators (20Nagata K.-I. Puls A.

Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM), leupeptin, pepstatin, and aprotinin were from ICN. Fetal calf serum was from the Commonwealth Serum Laboratories (Parkville, Australia) and gentamycin from David Bull Laboratories (Melbourne, Australia). Polyclonal anti-MLK2 antibodies were raised in sheep against a recombinant protein containing amino acids 1–100 of human MLK2 (11Dorow D.S. Devereux L., Tu, G.-F. Price G. Nicholl J.K.

Biochem. 1995; 234: 492-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) and affinity-purified using a MLK2-(1–100)-glutathione S-transferase fusion protein bound to GSH beads. For immunoblotting, anti-MLK2 antibodies were used with biotinylated rabbit anti-goat immunoglobulin secondary antibodies from Dako Australia (Botany, New South Wales, Australia). Rabbit anti-GFP antibodies and Texas Red-conjugated transferrin were from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR); mouse anti-CHC, anti-α-adaptin (AP-2), and anti-γ-adaptin (AP-1) antibodies were from Transduction Laboratories, and Texas Red-conjugated goat anti-mouse immunoglobulin antibodies were from Sigma. Biotinylated sheep anti-mouse and goat anti-rabbit immunoglobulin antibodies, streptavidin-biotin conjugated alkaline phosphatase, and Hybond C Super nitrocellulose membranes were from Amersham Biosciences. Alkaline phosphatase substrate reagent, 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolylphosphate, was from Roche Molecular Biochemicals, and nitro blue tetrazolium was from Sigma. FuGENETM 6 transfection reagent was also from Roche Molecular Biochemicals, and protein A-Sepharose was from AmershamBiosciences. Vectashield mounting medium was from Vector Laboratories (Burlingame, CA). cDNAs containing the complete human MLK2 protein-coding region (nucleotides 289–3454, including an in-frame stop codon beginning at nucleotide 3151 (11Dorow D.S.

For production of tetracycline-inducible cell lines, GFP-MLK2 was subcloned into vector pTRE (CLONTECH) and co-transfected with a modified Tet-ON (CLONTECH) vector (pEFpuropTet-ON (36Zhu H.J. Iaria J. Sizeland A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29220-29227Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar)) with tetracycline-inducible expression driven by the EF-1 promoter and a gene for puromycin resistance. The pEFpuropTet-ON vector was constructed by Dr. G. Vairo (Walter and Eliza Hall Institute, Melbourne, Australia) and was a gift from Dr. H.-J. Zhu (Ludwig Institute, Melbourne, Australia). Kinase-negative MLK2 mutant, K125A-MLK2 (DN-MLK2) was made using the Altered Sites® II in vitro mutagenesis kit (Promega) essentially according to the manufacturer's instructions, as described previously (19Phelan D.R. Loveland K.L. Devereux L. Dorow D.S. Mol. Reprod. Dev. 1998; 52: 135-140Crossref Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The clathrin box mutant, 932LDM934 ⇒ AAA C100A3-MLK2 was made by PCR-based mutagenesis. HEK-293 cells were maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and 20 μg/ml (20 IU) gentamycin at 37 °C in 5% CO2 in air. For transient expression, cells (0.5–1 × 106) were transfected with 2–5 μg of plasmid DNA using FuGENE 6TM transfection reagent and lysed for assay 24 h later. For GFP-stable transfectants, cells were transfected with 5 μg of plasmid DNA and grown in the presence of 400 μg/ml G418 antibiotic. Clones of resistant cells were isolated and assayed by microscopy for expression of the GFP fusion protein and by immunoblotting with anti-GFP antibodies to confirm the size of the expressed protein. Tet-ON lines were made by co-transfecting pEFpuropTet-ON vector together with a 10-fold excess of GFP-MLK2 pTRE into HEK-293 cells, and the cells were grown in the presence of 2 μg/ml puromycin. Resistant cells were cloned, and individual clones were selected for expression of correctly sized GFP fusion proteins following induction with 2 μg/ml doxycycline. GFP-MLK2 was immunoprecipitated with anti-GFP antibodies from untreated or doxycycline-treated (2 μg/ml, 24 h) GFP-MLK2-Tet-ON cells using anti-GFP antibody. Precipitated proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE on a 4–20% acrylamide gradient gel (NOVEX) and visualized by fast Coomassie Blue staining (37Wong C. Sridhara S. Bardwell J.C.A. Jakob U. BioTechniques. 2000; 28: 426-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Protein bands were excised and digestedin situ with 0.5 μg of trypsin as described previously (38Moritz R.L. Simpson R.J. J. Chromatogr. 1992; 599: 119-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 39Moritz R.L. Eddes J.S. Reid G.E. Simpson R.J. Electrophoresis. 1996; 17: 907-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). An electrospray ion trap mass spectrometer (model LCQ; Finnigan, San Jose, CA) coupled on-line with a capillary high pressure liquid chromatography was used for peptide sequencing (38Moritz R.L. Simpson R.J. J. Chromatogr. 1992; 599: 119-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 39Moritz R.L. Eddes J.S. Reid G.E. Simpson R.J. Electrophoresis. 1996; 17: 907-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Electrospray ionization parameters are as follows: spray voltage, 4.5 kV; sheath and auxiliary gas flow rates, 30 and 5 arbitrary values, respectively; capillary temperature, 150 °C; capillary voltage, 20 V; tube lens offset, 16 V. The sheath liquid was 2-methoxyethanol (99.9% high pressure liquid chromatography grade) delivered at a flow rate of 3 μl/min. The electron multiplier was set to 860 V. The ion trap automatic gain control parameter was turned on for all experiments, and this, coupled with a maximum injection time of 200 ms, ensured that the number of ions in the trap was automatically maintained at a constant preset value. All data were collected in centroid mode using a “triple play” experiment. After acquisition of a full mass spectrometry (MS) scan (350–2000 Da) in the first scan event, the most intense ion present above a preset threshold of 1 × 105 counts was isolated. In the second and third scan events, a high resolution (Zoom) scan and a collision-induced dissociation tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) scan of the selected ion were performed. The collision energy for the MS/MS scan events was preset at a value of 55%. The sequences of uninterpreted collision-induced dissociation spectra were identified by correlation with peptide sequences present in a non-redundant protein sequence data base (comprising ∼849,000 entries) using the SEQUEST algorithm (version 27, revision 11) incorporated into the Finnigan-BioBrowserTM software (version 2.0). The SEQUEST search results were assessed by examination of the Xcorr (cross-correlation) and Cn (normalized correlation) scores. Manual inspection of each spectrum was performed to confirm the SEQUEST result. Cells were washed in phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in ice-cold lysis buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.2, 150 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm EGTA, 1.5 mmMgCl2, 50 mm NaPO4, 5 mm dithiothreitol with the following protease inhibitors: 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and 1 μg/ml each aprotinin, leupeptin, and pepstatin). Lysates were incubated on ice for 10 min and then clarified by centrifugation at 13,000 rpm, 4 °C in a microcentrifuge. Clarified lysate protein concentrations were determined using the bicinchoninic acid assay (40Smith P.K. Krohn R.L. Hermanson G.T. Mallia A.K. Gartner F.H. Provenzano M.D. Fugimoto E.K. Goeke N.M. Olson B.J. Klenk D.C. Anal. Biochem. 1985; 150: 76-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (18645) Google Scholar), and protein concentrations were equalized for immune precipitation or immunoblotting. For immune precipitation, primary antibodies were added 1 h prior to addition of protein A-Sepharose (or a mixture of protein A-Sepharose and protein G-Sepharose in the case of anti-clathrin immune precipitation), and the mixture was incubated overnight at 4 °C on a rotating wheel. Sepharose beads were washed three times in lysis buffer and resuspended in SDS-PAGE sample buffer. Immune precipitates or aliquots of cellular lysate containing 30–50 μg of protein were subjected to SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose for immunoblotting. CCVs were isolated from cultured cells as described by Metzler et al.(67Metzler M. Legendre-Guillemin V. Gan L. Chopra V. Kwok A. McPherson P.S. Hayden M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 39271-39276Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Briefly, 8 × 107 cells were homogenized in 3 ml of ice-cold buffer A (0.1 m MES, pH 6.5, 1 mm EGTA, 0.5 mm MgCl2 with protease inhibitors, as above) on ice using a glass Dounce homogenizer (10 strokes; fraction H). All subsequent steps were performed on ice or at 4 °C. The homogenate was clarified by centrifugation at 17,800 × g for 20 min, and the supernatant was collected and centrifuged at 56,100 × g for 1 h. The pellet from the second centrifugation was resuspended in 500 μl of buffer A, loaded onto buffer A containing 8% sucrose, and centrifuged (115,800 × g, 2 h). The supernatant was removed, and the final pellet containing CCVs was resuspended in 30 μl of buffer A (fraction SGP). Equal amounts of protein from SGP fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. CCVs were isolated from mouse brain essentially following the procedure of Maycox et al. (41Maycox P.R. Link E. Reetz A. Morris S.A. Jahn R. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 118: 1379-1388Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar), with minor modifications. Briefly, 10 mouse brains were homogenized in 20 ml of cold buffer A using a glass homogenizer (10 strokes; fraction H) with subsequent steps on ice or at 4 °C. The homogenate was centrifuged at 20,000 × gfor 20 min. The pellet was resuspended in 5 ml of buffer A (fraction P1), and the supernatant (fraction S1) was centrifuged at 55,000 × g for 1 h. The supernatant was drained, and the pellet was resuspended in 1.2 ml of buffer A and homogenized as above (three strokes) followed by dispersion through a 26-gauge needle. The suspension (fraction P2) was then mixed with 1.2 ml of buffer A containing 12.5% Ficoll and 12.5% sucrose and centrifuged (40,000 × g, 40 min). The supernatant was diluted to 3.9 ml in buffer A and centrifuged (100,000 × g, 1 h) to pellet the vesicles. The supernatant was drained, and the pellet was resuspended in 1.0 ml of buffer A and dispersed through a 26-gauge needle. This suspension was cleared by centrifugation (20,000 × g, 20 min), and the pellet was resuspended in 100 μl of buffer A (fraction P4). The supernatant was layered on top of buffer A containing 8% sucrose and centrifuged for 2 h at 115,800 × g. The supernatant (fraction S4) was drained, and the final pellet was resuspended in 70 μl of buffer A (fraction SGP). Equal amounts of protein from fractions were analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-CHC, anti-MLK2, or anti-Myc tag (nonspecific) antibodies. Cells were plated onto poly-l-lysine-coated glass coverslips at a density of 1.5 × 106 cells/90-mm tissue culture plate, transfected as described above, and serum-starved overnight. Cells were then incubated with 25 μg/ml Texas Red-conjugated human transferrin in DMEM for 20 min, washed briefly in phosphate-buffered saline, and fixed for 10 min in 4% paraformaldehyde in PME buffer (100 mm Pipes, pH 6.9, 5 mm MgSO4, 10 mm EGTA, and 2 mm dithiothreitol). Cells with significant internal clustering of transferrin in recycling endosomes were counted using a Zeiss Axioskop 2 fluorescence microscope as follows: each coverslip was divided into quadrants, and 100 transfected cells (25 per quadrant) were evaluated for extent of transferrin clustering. Cells were scored as positive if significant clustering of transferrin was present and negative if only punctate distribution of red fluorescence was observed. Untransfected or transfected cells were counted on 6 independent coverslips (600 cells total) per expression construct. Although we (21Rasmussen R.K., Ji, H. Eddes J.S. Moritz R.L. Reid G.E.

Rab15 may interfere with Rab5 function directly by sequestering Rab5 effectors or indirectly through novel sets of effector interactions. To distinguish between these possibilities, we examined the effector binding properties of Rab15. Rab15 does not interact directly with the Rab5 effectors rabex-5 and rabaptin-5 in a yeast two-hybrid binding assay. Rather mammalian suppressor of Sec4 (Mss4) was identified as a binding partner for Rab15. Mss4 preferentially binds GDP-bound (T22N) and nucleotide-free (N121I) Rab15, consistent with the proposed role of Mss4 as a chaperone that stabilizes target Rabs in their nucleotide-free form. Mutational analysis of Rab15 indicates that lysine at position 48 (K48Q) is important for the binding of Rab15-GDP to Mss4. Moreover, the mutation K48Q counters the inhibitory phenotype of wild type Rab15 on receptor-mediated endocytosis in HeLa cells and homotypic endosome fusion in vitro without altering the relative amount of cell surface-associated transferrin receptor. Together, these data indicate a novel role for Mss4 as an effector for Rab15 in early endocytic trafficking.

Accordingly, endocytic compartments are highly specialized both in terms of their organization and function. The early/sorting endosome is a major trafficking compartment from which several trafficking pathways emerge. Recently, Rab GTPases have emerged as potent regulators of membrane trafficking through early/sorting endosomes. Rabs do not regulate membrane trafficking per se but function as regulatory throttles impacting the kinetics of membrane transport steps through the recruitment of specific effectors that in turn mediate membrane transport (reviewed in Refs. 3Zerial M.

Overexpression of the constitutively active GTP-bound mutant Rab5-Q79L in baby hamster kidney cells results in a dramatic increase in fluid phase and receptor-mediated endocytosis and leads to formation of enlarged early/sorting endosomes. Conversely, overexpression of GDP-bound Rab5 (S34N) reduces endocytic uptake and results in the formation of a diffuse network of small endocytic vesicles (6Li G. Stahl P.D. J. Biol.

Following activation on endosome membranes, Rab5-GTP drives the organization of a specialized membrane domain with distinct functional characteristics (13McBride H.M. Rybin V. Murphy C. Giner A.

Rab5-GTP forms this domain by recruiting the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase hVPs34, which catalyzes the local production of PI-3-phosphate (PI3P)1 (16Li G. D'Souza-Schorey C.

EEA1 also interacts directly with syntaxin 13, a SNARE implicated in the fusion of early endosomes (13McBride H.M. Rybin V. Murphy C. Giner A. Teasdale R. Zerial M. Cell. 1999; 98: 377-386Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar, 23Prekeris R. Klumperman J. Chen Y.A. Scheller R.H. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 957-971Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). Thus a model is emerging in which Rab5-GTP functions as a regulatory protein, driving assembly of specific effector complexes on endosomal membranes leading to membrane fusion (24Trischler M. Stoorvogel W. Ullrich O. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 4773-4783Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Consistent with this model, the early endocytic GTPases, Rabs 4 and 11, have also been shown to organize into distinct domains on early endosomes through the local recruitment of effectors (14Sonnichsen B., De Renzis S. Nielsen E. Rietdorf J. Zerial M. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 901-914Crossref PubMed Scopus (792) Google Scholar, 15De Renzis S. Sonnichsen B. Zerial M. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 124-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). Moreover, Rab4 and Rab5 function are linked through the shared effectors rabaptin-5 (25Vitale G. Rybin V. Christoforidis S. Thornqvist P. McCaffrey M. Stenmark H. Zerial M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1941-1951Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar) and rabenosyn-5 (15De Renzis S. Sonnichsen B. Zerial M. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 124-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). Thus Rab-specific domains appear to coordinate endosomal trafficking directly by communicating via shared effector complexes. The early endocytic GTPase Rab15 exhibits distinct endocytic localization and activity. Rab15 distributes between two early endosomal compartments, colocalizing with Rabs 4 and 5 on early/sorting endosomes and with Rab11 on pericentriolar recycling endosomes (26Zuk P.A. Elferink L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22303-22312Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Overexpression of activated Rab15 (Rab15-GTP) inhibits both fluid phase and receptor-mediated endocytosis in vivo and the homotypic fusion of early endosomes in vitro. Conversely, mutations that constitutively inactivate Rab15 (Rab15-GDP) stimulate early endocytosis and fusion of homotypic endosomes in vitro (27Zuk P.A. Elferink L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26754-26764Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These data suggest that Rab15 functions to reduce endocytic trafficking, primarily at the level of early/sorting endosomes. Consistent with an inhibitory role, overexpression of Rab15-GTP reverses the stimulatory effect of Rab5-GTP on early endocytosis, whereas coexpression of Rab15-GDP with activated Rab5 increased internalization of the fluid phase marker horseradish peroxidase relative to cells expressing activated Rab5 alone (27Zuk P.A. Elferink L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26754-26764Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Given the opposing effects of Rab15 and Rab5 on early endocytosis, the transport steps regulated by these GTPases likely intersect at some point within the endocytic network, presumably through the action of a shared effector or accessory protein. Rab15 may interfere with Rab5 function directly by sequestering Rab5 effectors or indirectly through a unique set of effector interactions. To distinguish between these possibilities, we examined the effector-binding properties of Rab15. By using a yeast two-hybrid binding assay, we demonstrate that Rab15 does not directly interact with the Rab5 effectors rabaptin-5 or rabex-5. Rather, mammalian suppressor of Sec4 (Mss4) was identified as a binding partner for Rab15. Mss4 specifically binds GDP-bound Rab15 (T22N) and the nucleotide-free mutant N121I, consistent with the proposed role of Mss4 as a chaperone mediating GDP removal, stabilizing its target Rab in a nucleotide-free state (28Collins R.N.

Our functional analyses indicate that interactions with Mss4 are required for the inhibitory effect of Rab15 in early endocytosis, suggesting a novel role for Mss4-mediated interactions in early endocytic trafficking.

A HeLa cell cDNA library pre-transformed into EGY187 (MATα) was kindly provided by Russell Finley, Jr. (Wayne State University). The cDNAs for wild type and mutant Rab15 (Q67L, N121I, and T22N) containing an amino-terminal HA epitope have been described elsewhere (27Zuk P.A. Elferink L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26754-26764Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and were cloned directly into pCI-Neo (Invitrogen). Site-directed mutagenesis was performed using the QuikChangeTM Mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) according to the manufacturer’s instructions and verified by DNA sequencing (Applied Biosystems). Bait strains were prepared by cloning wild type Rab15 and its respective mutants into pLexA (CLONTECH); GTP-bound Rab15 (Q67L), nucleotide-free Rab15 (N121I), GDP-bound Rab15 (T22N), Rab15-T22N containing the single mutations K46L or K48Q, and Rab15-T22N in which the motifs DN (residues 30–31), DFKMK (residues 44–48), and TITK (residues 72–75) were substituted with the corresponding Rab5a sequences KG, AFLTQ, and SLAP, respectively. cDNAs encoding rabaptin-5, rabex-5, and rabenosyn-5 were cloned into pB42AD (CLONTECH). Bait and prey constructs were transformed into RFY206 (MATa) and EGY187 (MATα), respectively, using established techniques (CLONTECH). Expression of the indicated bait and prey constructs was confirmed by SDS-PAGE and Western analysis. 2D. J. Strick, D. M. Francescutti, Y. Zhao, and L. A. Elferink, unpublished observations. Yeast two-hybrid binding assays were performed by mating bait strains with prey strains (33Kolonin M.G. Zhong J. Finley R.L. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 328: 26-46Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) as specified in the text. Positive diploids were identified by growth on quadruple synthetic dropout media (−Trp/−His/−Ura/−Leu) and LacZ activation. For LacZ activation assays, the appropriate diploids were grown in 5 ml of triple synthetic dropout media (−Trp/−His/−Ura) overnight at 30 °C and subcultured 1:10 in fresh dropout media for 7 h at 30 °C. Cells were pelleted at 1000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C, washed once in 5 ml of Z Buffer (113 mmNa2HPO4·7H2O, 39 mmNaH2PO4·H2O, 10 mmKCl, 1 mm MgSO4·7H2O, and 35 mm β-mercaptoethanol), resuspended in 120–150 μl of Z Buffer, and subjected to 3 cycles of 1-min freeze/thaws in liquid nitrogen. The lysates were centrifuged at 20,000 × gfor 5 min at 4 °C, and 15 μl of the clarified supernatant was incubated with 150 μl of CUG substrate (Molecular Probes) for 30 min at room temperature in darkness. The reactions were terminated with 75 μl of 0.2 m Na2CO3, and the relative fluorescence was measured according to the manufacturer’s specifications (Molecular Probes). Each assay was performed in triplicate and repeated at least twice. Relative fluorescence units were normalized to the amount of protein in each sample (Bradford, Bio-Rad) and are reported as a measure of relative β-galactosidase activity. A HeLa cell library was screened by mating EGY187 cells with a RYF206 strain expressing Rab15-T22N as indicated above. Plasmid DNA prepared from positive diploids identified in the library screen was isolated by transformation into Escherichia coli KC8 to isolate the library construct. Inserts from the resulting cDNAs were PCR amplified using the primers 5′-CGTAGTGGAGATGCCTCC-3′ and 5′-CTGGCAAGGTAGACAAGCCG-3′ and analyzed by HaeIII digestion and DNA sequence analysis (Applied Biosystems). DNA and predicted protein sequences were further analyzed using BLAST searches. All cells were cultured in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium supplemented with penicillin/streptomycin and maintained at 37 °C with 5% CO2. HeLa media was supplemented with 10% Cosmic Calf Sera (HyClone) and penicillin/streptomycin. Overexpression studies using T7 recombinant vaccinia virus (vTF7–3) were performed as described previously (26Zuk P.A. Elferink L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22303-22312Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 27Zuk P.A. Elferink L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26754-26764Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Transient expression using LipofectAMINETM (Invitrogen) was performed as described previously (26Zuk P.A. Elferink L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22303-22312Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 27Zuk P.A. Elferink L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26754-26764Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Recombinant rat Mss4 was expressed as a His6 fusion in BL21-DE3 pLys (Stratagene) and purified by NiNTA affinity chromatography (Qiagen). For pull-down studies, HeLa cells were transfected with Rab5 or HA-tagged Rab15 using LipofectAMINETM (Invitrogen) as described elsewhere (27Zuk P.A. Elferink L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26754-26764Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Transfected cells were resuspended in 200 μl of ice-cold lysis buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 1.5% IGEPAL (Sigma), 0.1 mm MgCl2, 150 mm NaCl, 10 μg/ml each aprotinin, leupeptin, and pepstatin A), and cell lysates were clarified at 16,000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C. Supernatants were adjusted to 1.0 mm MgCl2, incubated with 1.0 mm GTPγS (Sigma) or 1.0 mmGDPβS (Sigma) for 60 min at 4 °C, and the extracts incubated for 2.0 h at 4 °C with 5 μg of purified His6-Mss4. Mss4 and its associated proteins were isolated by binding to NiNTA beads in lysis buffer containing 10 mm imidazole at 4 °C for 60 min. Beads were washed three times in cell lysis buffer, three times in 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.5, 0.1 mm MgCl2, and analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by Western analysis by enhanced chemiluminescence (AmershamBiosciences). 125I-Tfn internalization studies andin vitro homotypic endosome fusion assays were performed on transiently transfected HeLa cells as described previously (27Zuk P.A. Elferink L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26754-26764Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Surface-bound Tfn was assessed as follows. Transiently transfected HeLa cells were depleted of endogenous Tfn for 1 h at 37 °C and chilled at 4 °C for 30 min to stop endocytosis. The cells were incubated in IM (Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium with 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, and 20 mg/ml bovine serum albumin) containing 3 μg/ml 125I-Tfn for 1 h at 4 °C to enable binding of the 125I-Tfn to cell surface-associated TfR. The cells were washed in PBS containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin at 4 °C, and the total amount of cell-associated125I-Tfn was measured with a gamma counter (Packard Instrument Co.). 80–90% of the cell-associated 125I-Tfn was routinely removed with three successive acid washes as described previously (27Zuk P.A. Elferink L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26754-26764Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (data not shown). All numerical results were subjected to a one-way ANOVA with a Neuman-Keuls post hoc test to determine statistical significance between selected groups (Prism GraphPad). Given the opposing effects of Rab15 and Rab5 on early endocytosis, it is highly likely that the transport steps regulated by these Rabs overlap at some point within the endocytic network, possibly in terms of a common effector or target. We first examined the ability of Rab15 to interact with the Rab5 effectors rabex-5 (31Horiuchi H. Lippe R. McBride H.M. Rubino M. Woodman P. Stenmark H. Rybin V. Vilm M. Ashman K. Mann M. Zerial M. Cell. 1997; 90: 1149-1159Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar), rabaptin-5 (32Stenmark H. Vitale G. Ullrich O. Zerial M. Cell. 1995; 83: 423-432Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar), and rabenosyn-5 (22Nielsen E. Christoforidis S. Uttenweiler-Joseph S. Miaczynska M. Dewitte F. Wilm M. Hoflack B. Zerial M. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 601-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). Rabex-5 is a guanine nucleotide exchange factor for Rab5 originally identified as a component in a complex with rabaptin-5. Rabaptin-5 increases the exchange activity of rabex-5 on Rab5, promoting early endosome fusion in vitro (34Lippe R. Miaczynska M. Rybin V. Runge A. Zerial M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 2219-2228Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Rabaptin-5 also interacts with Rab4 through a distinct binding site (25Vitale G. Rybin V. Christoforidis S. Thornqvist P. McCaffrey M. Stenmark H. Zerial M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1941-1951Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar) suggesting a role for this effector in recycling from early endosomes to the cell surface. Rabenosyn-5 preferentially interacts with GTP-bound Rab5 (Rab5-Q79L) and PI3P on early endosomes. Consistent with the stimulatory role of Rab5-GTP in endocytosis, rabenosyn-5 promotes homotypic endosome and clathrin-coated vesicle fusion in vitro (22Nielsen E. Christoforidis S. Uttenweiler-Joseph S. Miaczynska M. Dewitte F. Wilm M. Hoflack B. Zerial M. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 601-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). In addition, rabenosyn-5 interacts directly with Rab4-GTP and promotes transferrin (Tfn) recycling from early sorting endosomes when overexpressed in HeLa cells (15De Renzis S. Sonnichsen B. Zerial M. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 124-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). Rabaptin-5 is a cytosolic protein that was originally identified as an effector for Rab5-GTP using a yeast two-hybrid approach (32Stenmark H. Vitale G. Ullrich O. Zerial M. Cell. 1995; 83: 423-432Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar). Thus interactions with shared effectors may functionally couple otherwise distinct Rab-mediated transport steps within early sorting endosomes (25Vitale G. Rybin V. Christoforidis S. Thornqvist P. McCaffrey M. Stenmark H. Zerial M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1941-1951Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar, 32Stenmark H. Vitale G. Ullrich O. Zerial M. Cell. 1995; 83: 423-432Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar). To determine whether Rab15 binds Rab5 effectors, cDNAs encoding rabex-5, rabaptin-5, and rabenosyn-5 were cloned into the plasmid pB42AD, in-frame with the activation domain of the bacterial transcription factor, B42, and conditionally expressed from the Gal1 promoter in the presence of galactose. Wild type and mutant Rab15 were expressed in-frame with the DNA binding domain of the bacterial transcription factor LexA, and protein-protein interactions were assayed using leu2 (data not shown) and lacZ(Table I) activation as reporter genes. Negligible binding was detected between Rabex-5 and wild type or mutant Rab15. Similarly, we detected no interaction between rabaptin-5 and wild type or mutant Rab15 (Table I). Western analysis indicates that the absence of any notable interaction between Rab15 and rabex-5 or rabaptin-5 in this assay is not related to differences in the relative amounts of the expressed prey and bait proteins (data not shown). Moreover, Rab5 strongly interacted with rabex-5 and rabaptin-5, indicating the specificity of the results. Specifically, rabex-5 bound GDP-bound (S34N) and the nucleotide-deficient mutant Rab5-N133I. Conversely, rabaptin-5 interacted directly with Rab5-GTP (Q79L) and the nucleotide-free Rab5 mutant, N133I. Interestingly, a weak interaction was detected between rabenosyn-5 and wild type Rab15 as well as the GTP-bound and nucleotide-free Rab15 mutants, Rab15-Q67L and Rab15-N121I, respectively (Table I). Given the modest binding observed between Rab15 and rabenosyn-5 in the absence of any discernible nucleotide dependence, the physiological significance of this interaction remains uncertain. Taken together, these data indicate that Rab15 does not directly interact with the Rab5 effectors rabex-5 and rabaptin-5.Table Iβ-Galactosidase activity (relative fluorescence units)pLexA constructRabaptin-5Rabex-5Rabenosyn-5Rab15 wt5824.3 ± 208.74062.2 ± 50.129,834.3 ± 936.6Rab15 Q67L8535.4 ± 279.37119.2 ± 209.731,798.0 ± 830.1Rab15 T22N4300.7 ± 64.61962.0 ± 35.18708.2 ± 184.0Rab15 N121I3282.3 ± 140.05976.6 ± 150.117,000.0 ± 343.2Rab5 wt5273.1 ± 513.51521.4 ± 31.97282.9 ± 111.5Rab5 Q79L2,114,619.0 ± 71,380.75248.2 ± 224.350,862.3 ± 846.8Rab5 S34N1606.3 ± 117.9131,750.0 ± 2556.05913.3 ± 160.0Rab5 N133I227,130.0 ± 4036.683,173.9 ± 1537.987,852.1 ± 1725.2 Open table in a new tab Because Rab15 does not interact with the Rab5 effectors rabaptin-5 and rabex-5, we reasoned that the inhibitory effect of Rab15 during early endocytosis is regulated by a unique set of effector molecules. Therefore, we screened a HeLa cell cDNA library using Rab15-T22N as “bait” in a yeast two-hybrid system. HeLa cells are known to express Rab15 (26Zuk P.A. Elferink L.A. J. Biol.

Eleven of twelve strongly positive clones were identified as Mss4. All Mss4 clones isolated from this screen minimally encoded residues 1–55. Mss4 and its yeast homologue Dss4p were originally identified in genetic screens for proteins that suppressed the secretory defect of sec4-8 mutants (33Kolonin M.G. Zhong J. Finley R.L. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 328: 26-46Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 34Lippe R. Miaczynska M. Rybin V. Runge A. Zerial M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 2219-2228Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Mss4 specifically binds to and promotes the release of GDP from a subset of Rabs including Sec4, Rabs 1a, 3, 8 10, and 13. Mss4 does not bind Rabs 2, 4 or 7; moreover, no interaction is observed between Mss4 and Rab5 (29Burton J.L. Burns M.E. Gatti E. Augustine G.J. De Camilli P. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5547-5558Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 37Burton J.L. Slepnev V. De Camilli P.V. J. Biol.

Although Mss4 and Dss4p facilitate the release of GDP from their target Rabs, they lack the ability to promote GTP binding (28Collins R.N. Brennwald P. Garrett M. Lauring A. Novick P. J. Biol.

Nature. 1995; 376: 788-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) but rather stabilizes Rabs in a nucleotide-free state (30Nuoffer C., Wu, S.K. Dascher C. Balch W.E. Mol. Biol.
