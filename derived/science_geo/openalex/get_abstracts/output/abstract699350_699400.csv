https://openalex.org/W4293004820,"Abstract The efficacy of adoptive T cell therapies for cancer treatment can be limited by suppressive signals from both extrinsic factors and intrinsic inhibitory checkpoints 1,2 . Targeted gene editing has the potential to overcome these limitations and enhance T cell therapeutic function 3–10 . Here we performed multiple genome-wide CRISPR knock-out screens under different immunosuppressive conditions to identify genes that can be targeted to prevent T cell dysfunction. These screens converged on RASA2, a RAS GTPase-activating protein (RasGAP) that we identify as a signalling checkpoint in human T cells, which is downregulated upon acute T cell receptor stimulation and can increase gradually with chronic antigen exposure. RASA2 ablation enhanced MAPK signalling and chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell cytolytic activity in response to target antigen. Repeated tumour antigen stimulations in vitro revealed that RASA2-deficient T cells show increased activation, cytokine production and metabolic activity compared with control cells, and show a marked advantage in persistent cancer cell killing. RASA2-knockout CAR T cells had a competitive fitness advantage over control cells in the bone marrow in a mouse model of leukaemia. Ablation of RASA2 in multiple preclinical models of T cell receptor and CAR T cell therapies prolonged survival in mice xenografted with either liquid or solid tumours. Together, our findings highlight RASA2 as a promising target to enhance both persistence and effector function in T cell therapies for cancer treatment."

https://openalex.org/W4293004881,"Individual differences in brain functional organization track a range of traits, symptoms and behaviours1-12. So far, work modelling linear brain-phenotype relationships has assumed that a single such relationship generalizes across all individuals, but models do not work equally well in all participants13,14. A better understanding of in whom models fail and why is crucial to revealing robust, useful and unbiased brain-phenotype relationships. To this end, here we related brain activity to phenotype using predictive models-trained and tested on independent data to ensure generalizability15-and examined model failure. We applied this data-driven approach to a range of neurocognitive measures in a new, clinically and demographically heterogeneous dataset, with the results replicated in two independent, publicly available datasets16,17. Across all three datasets, we find that models reflect not unitary cognitive constructs, but rather neurocognitive scores intertwined with sociodemographic and clinical covariates; that is, models reflect stereotypical profiles, and fail when applied to individuals who defy them. Model failure is reliable, phenotype specific and generalizable across datasets. Together, these results highlight the pitfalls of a one-size-fits-all modelling approach and the effect of biased phenotypic measures18-20 on the interpretation and utility of resulting brain-phenotype models. We present a framework to address these issues so that such models may reveal the neural circuits that underlie specific phenotypes and ultimately identify individualized neural targets for clinical intervention."

https://openalex.org/W4293004913,"Entanglement is a powerful concept with an enormous potential for scientific and technological advances. A central focus in modern research is to extend the generation and control of entangled states from few to many qubits, and protect them against decoherence. Optical photons play a prominent role as these qubit carriers are naturally robust and easy to manipulate. However, the most successful technique to date for creating photonic entanglement is inherently probabilistic and therefore subject to severe scalability limitations. Here we avoid these by implementing a deterministic protocol with a single memory atom in a cavity. We interleave controlled single-photon emissions with tailored atomic qubit rotations to efficiently grow Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger states of up to 14 photons and linear cluster states of up to 12 photons with a fidelity lower bounded by 76(6)% and 56(4)%, respectively. Thanks to a source-to-detection efficiency of 43.18(7)% per photon we measure these large states about once every minute, orders of magnitude faster than in any previous experiment. In the future, this rate could be increased even further, the scheme could be extended to two atoms in a cavity, or several sources could be quantum mechanically coupled, to generate higher-dimensional cluster states. Our work therefore removes a long-standing obstacle towards scalable measurement-based quantum computation and communication."
https://openalex.org/W4293004809,"Abstract Cas9 is a CRISPR-associated endonuclease capable of RNA-guided, site-specific DNA cleavage 1–3 . The programmable activity of Cas9 has been widely utilized for genome editing applications 4–6 , yet its precise mechanisms of target DNA binding and off-target discrimination remain incompletely understood. Here we report a series of cryo-electron microscopy structures of Streptococcus pyogenes Cas9 capturing the directional process of target DNA hybridization. In the early phase of R-loop formation, the Cas9 REC2 and REC3 domains form a positively charged cleft that accommodates the distal end of the target DNA duplex. Guide–target hybridization past the seed region induces rearrangements of the REC2 and REC3 domains and relocation of the HNH nuclease domain to assume a catalytically incompetent checkpoint conformation. Completion of the guide–target heteroduplex triggers conformational activation of the HNH nuclease domain, enabled by distortion of the guide–target heteroduplex, and complementary REC2 and REC3 domain rearrangements. Together, these results establish a structural framework for target DNA-dependent activation of Cas9 that sheds light on its conformational checkpoint mechanism and may facilitate the development of novel Cas9 variants and guide RNA designs with enhanced specificity and activity."
https://openalex.org/W4293100327,"Bipedal locomotion is one of the key adaptations that define the hominin clade. Evidence of bipedalism is known from postcranial remains of late Miocene hominins as early as 6 million years ago (Ma) in eastern Africa1–4. Bipedality of Sahelanthropus tchadensis was hitherto inferred about 7 Ma in central Africa (Chad) based on cranial evidence5–7. Here we present postcranial evidence of the locomotor behaviour of S. tchadensis, with new insights into bipedalism at the early stage of hominin evolutionary history. The original material was discovered at locality TM 266 of the Toros-Ménalla fossiliferous area and consists of one left femur and two, right and left, ulnae. The morphology of the femur is most parsimonious with habitual bipedality, and the ulnae preserve evidence of substantial arboreal behaviour. Taken together, these findings suggest that hominins were already bipeds at around 7 Ma but also suggest that arboreal clambering was probably a significant part of their locomotor repertoire. Analyses of a thigh bone and a pair of elbow bones from Sahelanthropus tchadensis discovered in Chad suggest that the earliest hominin exhibited bipedalism with substantial arboreal clambering."
https://openalex.org/W4293004765,"Abstract Future large-scale quantum computers will rely on quantum error correction (QEC) to protect the fragile quantum information during computation 1,2 . Among the possible candidate platforms for realizing quantum computing devices, the compatibility with mature nanofabrication technologies of silicon-based spin qubits offers promise to overcome the challenges in scaling up device sizes from the prototypes of today to large-scale computers 3–5 . Recent advances in silicon-based qubits have enabled the implementations of high-quality one-qubit and two-qubit systems 6–8 . However, the demonstration of QEC, which requires three or more coupled qubits 1 , and involves a three-qubit gate 9–11 or measurement-based feedback, remains an open challenge. Here we demonstrate a three-qubit phase-correcting code in silicon, in which an encoded three-qubit state is protected against any phase-flip error on one of the three qubits. The correction to this encoded state is performed by a three-qubit conditional rotation, which we implement by an efficient single-step resonantly driven iToffoli gate. As expected, the error correction mitigates the errors owing to one-qubit phase-flip, as well as the intrinsic dephasing mainly owing to quasi-static phase noise. These results show successful implementation of QEC and the potential of a silicon-based platform for large-scale quantum computing."
https://openalex.org/W4293004892,"In the hippocampus, spatial maps are formed by place cells while contextual memories are thought to be encoded as engrams1-6. Engrams are typically identified by expression of the immediate early gene Fos, but little is known about the neural activity patterns that drive, and are shaped by, Fos expression in behaving animals7-10. Thus, it is unclear whether Fos-expressing hippocampal neurons also encode spatial maps and whether Fos expression correlates with and affects specific features of the place code11. Here we measured the activity of CA1 neurons with calcium imaging while monitoring Fos induction in mice performing a hippocampus-dependent spatial learning task in virtual reality. We find that neurons with high Fos induction form ensembles of cells with highly correlated activity, exhibit reliable place fields that evenly tile the environment and have more stable tuning across days than nearby non-Fos-induced cells. Comparing neighbouring cells with and without Fos function using a sparse genetic loss-of-function approach, we find that neurons with disrupted Fos function have less reliable activity, decreased spatial selectivity and lower across-day stability. Our results demonstrate that Fos-induced cells contribute to hippocampal place codes by encoding accurate, stable and spatially uniform maps and that Fos itself has a causal role in shaping these place codes. Fos ensembles may therefore link two key aspects of hippocampal function: engrams for contextual memories and place codes that underlie cognitive maps."
https://openalex.org/W4293005044,"Abstract Animals and fungi have radically distinct morphologies, yet both evolved within the same eukaryotic supergroup: Opisthokonta 1,2 . Here we reconstructed the trajectory of genetic changes that accompanied the origin of Metazoa and Fungi since the divergence of Opisthokonta with a dataset that includes four novel genomes from crucial positions in the Opisthokonta phylogeny. We show that animals arose only after the accumulation of genes functionally important for their multicellularity, a tendency that began in the pre-metazoan ancestors and later accelerated in the metazoan root. By contrast, the pre-fungal ancestors experienced net losses of most functional categories, including those gained in the path to Metazoa. On a broad-scale functional level, fungal genomes contain a higher proportion of metabolic genes and diverged less from the last common ancestor of Opisthokonta than did the gene repertoires of Metazoa. Metazoa and Fungi also show differences regarding gene gain mechanisms. Gene fusions are more prevalent in Metazoa, whereas a larger fraction of gene gains were detected as horizontal gene transfers in Fungi and protists, in agreement with the long-standing idea that transfers would be less relevant in Metazoa due to germline isolation 3–5 . Together, our results indicate that animals and fungi evolved under two contrasting trajectories of genetic change that predated the origin of both groups. The gradual establishment of two clearly differentiated genomic contexts thus set the stage for the emergence of Metazoa and Fungi."

https://openalex.org/W4292756165,"Opposing roles have been proposed for IL-22 in intestinal pathophysiology. We have optimized human small intestinal organoid (hSIO) culturing, constitutively generating all differentiated cell types while maintaining an active stem cell compartment. IL-22 does not promote the expansion of stem cells but rather slows the growth of hSIOs. In hSIOs, IL-22 is required for formation of Paneth cells, the prime producers of intestinal antimicrobial peptides (AMPs). Introduction of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)-associated loss-of-function mutations in the IL-22 co-receptor gene IL10RB resulted in abolishment of Paneth cells in hSIOs. Moreover, IL-22 induced expression of host defense genes (such as REG1A, REG1B, and DMBT1) in enterocytes, goblet cells, Paneth cells, Tuft cells, and even stem cells. Thus, IL-22 does not directly control the regenerative capacity of crypt stem cells but rather boosts Paneth cell numbers, as well as the expression of AMPs in all cell types."

https://openalex.org/W4293004899,"Revealing universal behaviours is a hallmark of statistical physics. Phenomena such as the stochastic growth of crystalline surfaces1 and of interfaces in bacterial colonies2, and spin transport in quantum magnets3–6 all belong to the same universality class, despite the great plurality of physical mechanisms they involve at the microscopic level. More specifically, in all these systems, space–time correlations show power-law scalings characterized by universal critical exponents. This universality stems from a common underlying effective dynamics governed by the nonlinear stochastic Kardar–Parisi–Zhang (KPZ) equation7. Recent theoretical works have suggested that this dynamics also emerges in the phase of out-of-equilibrium systems showing macroscopic spontaneous coherence8–17. Here we experimentally demonstrate that the evolution of the phase in a driven-dissipative one-dimensional polariton condensate falls in the KPZ universality class. Our demonstration relies on a direct measurement of KPZ space–time scaling laws18,19, combined with a theoretical analysis that reveals other key signatures of this universality class. Our results highlight fundamental physical differences between out-of-equilibrium condensates and their equilibrium counterparts, and open a paradigm for exploring universal behaviours in driven open quantum systems. Experiments show that the dynamics of phase fluctuations in a one-dimensional polariton condensate falls in the Kardar–Parisi–Zhang universality class, and theoretical analysis supports this finding revealing the key signatures of this universality class."

https://openalex.org/W4292937248,"The Holliday junction is a key intermediate formed during DNA recombination across all kingdoms of life1. In bacteria, the Holliday junction is processed by two homo-hexameric AAA+ ATPase RuvB motors, which assemble together with the RuvA-Holliday junction complex to energize the strand-exchange reaction2. Despite its importance for chromosome maintenance, the structure and mechanism by which this complex facilitates branch migration are unknown. Here, using time-resolved cryo-electron microscopy, we obtained structures of the ATP-hydrolysing RuvAB complex in seven distinct conformational states, captured during assembly and processing of a Holliday junction. Five structures together resolve the complete nucleotide cycle and reveal the spatiotemporal relationship between ATP hydrolysis, nucleotide exchange and context-specific conformational changes in RuvB. Coordinated motions in a converter formed by DNA-disengaged RuvB subunits stimulate hydrolysis and nucleotide exchange. Immobilization of the converter enables RuvB to convert the ATP-contained energy into a lever motion, which generates the pulling force driving the branch migration. We show that RuvB motors rotate together with the DNA substrate, which, together with a progressing nucleotide cycle, forms the mechanistic basis for DNA recombination by continuous branch migration. Together, our data decipher the molecular principles of homologous recombination by the RuvAB complex, elucidate discrete and sequential transition-state intermediates for chemo-mechanical coupling of hexameric AAA+ motors and provide a blueprint for the design of state-specific compounds targeting AAA+ motors."
https://openalex.org/W4293005009,"Bacterial cell wall components provide various unique molecular structures that are detected by pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) of the innate immune system as non-self. Most bacterial species form a cell wall that consists of peptidoglycan (PGN), a polymeric structure comprising alternating amino sugars that form strands cross-linked by short peptides. Muramyl dipeptide (MDP) has been well documented as a minimal immunogenic component of peptidoglycan1-3. MDP is sensed by the cytosolic nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-containing protein 24 (NOD2). Upon engagement, it triggers pro-inflammatory gene expression, and this functionality is of critical importance in maintaining a healthy intestinal barrier function5. Here, using a forward genetic screen to identify factors required for MDP detection, we identified N-acetylglucosamine kinase (NAGK) as being essential for the immunostimulatory activity of MDP. NAGK is broadly expressed in immune cells and has previously been described to contribute to the hexosamine biosynthetic salvage pathway6. Mechanistically, NAGK functions upstream of NOD2 by directly phosphorylating the N-acetylmuramic acid moiety of MDP at the hydroxyl group of its C6 position, yielding 6-O-phospho-MDP. NAGK-phosphorylated MDP-but not unmodified MDP-constitutes an agonist for NOD2. Macrophages from mice deficient in NAGK are completely deficient in MDP sensing. These results reveal a link between amino sugar metabolism and innate immunity to bacterial cell walls."
https://openalex.org/W4293004798,"Throughout their daily lives, animals and humans often switch between different behaviours. However, neuroscience research typically studies the brain while the animal is performing one behavioural task at a time, and little is known about how brain circuits represent switches between different behaviours. Here we tested this question using an ethological setting: two bats flew together in a long 135 m tunnel, and switched between navigation when flying alone (solo) and collision avoidance as they flew past each other (cross-over). Bats increased their echolocation click rate before each cross-over, indicating attention to the other bat1-9. Hippocampal CA1 neurons represented the bat's own position when flying alone (place coding10-14). Notably, during cross-overs, neurons switched rapidly to jointly represent the interbat distance by self-position. This neuronal switch was very fast-as fast as 100 ms-which could be revealed owing to the very rapid natural behavioural switch. The neuronal switch correlated with the attention signal, as indexed by echolocation. Interestingly, the different place fields of the same neuron often exhibited very different tuning to interbat distance, creating a complex non-separable coding of position by distance. Theoretical analysis showed that this complex representation yields more efficient coding. Overall, our results suggest that during dynamic natural behaviour, hippocampal neurons can rapidly switch their core computation to represent the relevant behavioural variables, supporting behavioural flexibility."

This work aims to evaluate the performance of deep convolutional neural network (CNN) algorithms for the classification and detection of oral potentially malignant disorders (OPMDs) and oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) in oral photographic images. A dataset comprising 980 oral photographic images was divided into 365 images of OSCC, 315 images of OPMDs and 300 images of non-pathological images. Multiclass image classification models were created by using DenseNet-169, ResNet-101, SqueezeNet and Swin-S. Multiclass object detection models were fabricated by using faster R-CNN, YOLOv5, RetinaNet and CenterNet2. The AUC of multiclass image classification of the best CNN models, DenseNet-196, was 1.00 and 0.98 on OSCC and OPMDs, respectively. The AUC of the best multiclass CNN-base object detection models, Faster R-CNN, was 0.88 and 0.64 on OSCC and OPMDs, respectively. In comparison, DenseNet-196 yielded the best multiclass image classification performance with AUC of 1.00 and 0.98 on OSCC and OPMD, respectively. These values were inline with the performance of experts and superior to those of general practictioners (GPs). In conclusion, CNN-based models have potential for the identification of OSCC and OPMDs in oral photographic images and are expected to be a diagnostic tool to assist GPs for the early detection of oral cancer."
https://openalex.org/W4293101934,"Both psychedelic drug experiences and near-death experiences can occasion changes in perspectives on death and dying, but there have been few direct comparisons of these phenomena. This study directly compared psychedelic occasioned and non-drug experiences which altered individuals’ beliefs about death. Individuals who reported an experience that altered their beliefs about death occasioned by either a psychedelic drug or a near-death or other non-ordinary experience completed an online survey. Circumstances of the experience, mystical and near-death subjective features, changes in attitudes about death, and other persisting effects were evaluated. The study sample ( n = 3192) included five groups: non-drug near-death or other non-ordinary experiences ( n = 933), and drug experiences occasioned by lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) ( n = 904), psilocybin ( n = 766), ayahuasca ( n = 282), or N , N- dimethyltryptamine (DMT) ( n = 307). Analyses of differences in experiences were adjusted statistically for demographic differences between groups. Compared to the psychedelic groups, the non-drug group was more likely to report being unconscious, clinically dead, and that their life was in imminent danger. The groups were remarkably similar in the reported changes in death attitudes attributed to the experience, including a reduced fear of death and high ratings of positive persisting effects and personal meaning, spiritual significance, and psychological insight. Although both psychedelic and non-drug participants showed robust increases on standardized measures of mystical and near-death experiences, these measures were significantly greater in the psychedelic participants. Non-drug participants were more likely to rate their experiences as the single most meaningful of their lives. Comparing across psychedelic substances, ayahuasca and DMT groups tended report stronger and more positive enduring consequences of the experience than the psilocybin and LSD groups, which were largely indistinguishable. These data provide a detailed characterization and comparison of psychedelic occasioned and non-drug experiences that changed attitudes about death and suggest the importance of future prospective psychedelic administration studies."
https://openalex.org/W4293105504,"Background The COVID-19 pandemic has had unprecedented effects on mental health and community functioning. Negative effects related to disruption of individuals’ social connections may have been more severe for those who had tenuous social connections prior to the pandemic. Veterans who have recently experienced homelessness (RHV) or have a psychotic disorder (PSY) are considered particularly vulnerable because many had poor social connections prior to the pandemic. Methods We conducted a 15-month longitudinal study between May 2020 –July 2021 assessing clinical (e.g., depression, anxiety) and community (e.g., social functioning, work functioning) outcomes. Eighty-one PSY, 76 RHV, and 74 Veteran controls (CTL) were interviewed over 5 assessment periods. We assessed changes in mental health and community functioning trajectories relative to pre-pandemic retrospective ratings and examined group differences in these trajectories. Results All groups had significantly increased symptoms of depression, anxiety, and concerns with contamination at the onset of the pandemic. However, RHV and PSY showed faster returns to their baseline levels compared to CTL, who took nearly 15 months to return to baseline. With regards to functioning, both RHV and PSY, but not CTL, had significant improvements in family and social networks over time. Work functioning worsened over time only in PSY, and independent living increased over time in both RHV and PSY but not CTL. Conclusions These results reveal that vulnerable Veterans with access to VA mental health and case management services exhibited lower negative impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on mental health and community functioning than expected."

Here we provide a biomass estimate for Antarctic krill ( Euphausia superba ) in the eastern sector of the Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR) Division 58.4.2 (55°E to 80°E; area = 775,732 km 2 ) using data collected during an acoustic-trawl survey carried out in February and March 2021. Using acoustic data collected in day-time and trawl data, areal biomass density was estimated as 8.3 gm -2 giving a total areal krill biomass of 6.48 million tonnes, with a 28.9% coefficient of variation (CV). The inaccessibility of the East Antarctic makes fisheries-independent surveys of Antarctic krill expensive and time consuming, so we also assessed the efficacy of extrapolating smaller surveys to a wider area. During the large-scale survey a smaller scale survey (centre coordinates -66.28°S 63.35°E, area = 4,902 km 2 ) was conducted. We examine how representative krill densities from the small-scale (Mawson box) survey were over a latitudinal range by comparing krill densities from the large-scale survey split into latitudinal bands. We found the small scale survey provided a good representation of the statistical distribution of krill densities within its latitudinal band (KS-test, D = 0.048, p -value = 0.98), as well as mean density ( t -test p -value = 0.44), but not outside of the band. We recommend further in situ testing of this approach."

https://openalex.org/W4293103928,"Background and objective A cytokine storm is caused by inflammatory cells, including pro-inflammatory macrophage phenotype (M1), and play a critical role in the pathogenesis of COVID-19, in which diffuse alveolar damage occurs in the lungs due to oxidative stress exposure. Heme oxygenase (HO)-1 is a stress-induced protein produced by the anti-inflammatory / anti-oxidative macrophage phenotype (M2), which also produces soluble CD163 (sCD163). In our study, we investigated and determined that serum HO-1 can be a predictive biomarker for assessing both the severity and the outcome of COVID-19 patients. Method The serum concentrations of HO-1 and sCD163 of COVID-19 patients were measured on admission. The relationship between these biomarkers and other clinical parameters and outcomes were evaluated. Results Sixty-four COVID-19 patients (11 mild, 38 moderate, and 15 severe cases) were assessed. The serum HO-1 tended to increase (11.0 ng/mL vs. 24.3 ng/mL vs. 59.6 ng/mL with severity). Serum HO-1 correlated with serum lactate dehydrogenase (R = 0.422), C-reactive protein (R = 0.463), and the ground glass opacity (GGO) and consolidation score (R = 0.625) of chest computed tomography. The serum HO-1 showed a better area under the curve (AUC) for predicting ICU admission than the serum sCD163 (HO-1; 0.816 and sCD163; 0.743). In addition, composite parameters including serum HO-1 and the GGO and consolidation score showed a higher AUC for predicting ICU admission than the AUC of a single parameter. Conclusion Clinically, serum HO-1, reflecting the activation of M2, could be a very useful marker for evaluating disease severity and predicting prognoses for COVID-19 patients. In addition, controlling activated M2 might be a preventative COVID-19 therapeutic target."
https://openalex.org/W4293104847,"Fat grafting is one of the most commonly applied procedure for soft-tissue repair. However, it remains unclear whether the type of adipose tissue would have any effects on fat graft survival. The present study aimed to determine fates of fat grafting of three different types of fat tissue. In this study, mice were randomly divided into three groups, white adipose tissue (WAT) group, beige adipose tissue (beige AT) group and brown adipose tissue (BAT) group. Before transplantation, donor mice were injected with rosiglitazone or phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). The WAT and BAT were obtained from PBS-treated mice while beige AT was obtained from the rosiglitazone-treated mice. Three types of fat tissue (150 mg each) were transplanted in three groups, respectively, and harvested at 2, 4 or 12 weeks. The BAT and beige AT contained smaller adipocytes and expressed higher level of uncoupling protein-1 gene. The retention rate of the transplanted fat was significantly higher for beige than for white fat, but was significantly lower for brown than for white fat. Transplanted brown fat was characterized by upregulated inflammation and high endoplasmic reticulum stress. By contrast, fat grafts in beige AT group showed the best adipogenic capacity, moderate inflammation level and superior angiongenesis. In vitro, under hypoxic condition, fewer apoptotic cells were found in beige adipocyte group than that in brown and white adipocyte group. Conditioned medium from brown adipocytes induced M1 polarization of RAW 264.7 macrophages while that from beige adipocytes effectively promoted M2 polarization. Therefore, we suggest that beige AT provides a new potential choice for fat grafting because of low inflammation and superior survival but BAT might not be ideal for fat grafting due to its poor survival."

Our study explores characteristic language patterns of Hungarian prime ministers (PMs) with a special emphasis on one of the key indicators of hubris, the shift from the first person “I” to “we” in spontaneous speech. We analyzed the ratio of the first-person singular (“I”) and plural (“we”) pronouns and verbal inflections in the spontaneous parliamentary speeches of four Hungarian PMs between 1998–2018. We found that Viktor Orbán during his second premiership (2010–2014) used first person plural relative to singular inflections more often than the other three PMs during their terms. Orbán and another Hungarian PM, Ferenc Gyurcsány, who were re-elected at some point showed an increased ratio of first-person plural vs. singular inflections and personal pronouns by their second term, likely reflecting increasing hubristic tendencies. The results show that the ratio of “I” and “we” usually studied in English texts also show changes in a structurally different language, Hungarian. This finding suggests that it is extended periods of premiership that may increase hubristic behaviour in political leaders, not only experiencing excessive power. The results are particularly elucidating regarding the role of re-elections in political leaders’ hubristic speech–and behaviour."
https://openalex.org/W4293105704,"Out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) is a significant public health issue with low survival rates. Prompt bystander action can more than double survival odds. OHCA response training is primarily pursued due to work-related mandates, with few programs targeting communities with lower training levels. The aim of this research was to describe the development process of a targeted multicomponent intervention package designed to enhance confidence and training among laypeople in responding to an OHCA.An iterative, three-phase program development process was employed using a mixed methods approach. The initial phase involved establishment of a multidisciplinary panel that informed decisions on key messages, program content, format, and delivery modes. These decisions were based on scientific evidence and guided by behavioural theories. The second phase comprised the development of the intervention package, identifying existing information and developing new material to fill identified gaps. The third phase involved refining and finalising the material via feedback from panel members, stakeholders, and community members.Through this approach, we collaboratively developed a comprehensive evidence-based education and training package consisting of a digital intervention supplemented with free access to in-person education and training. The package was designed to teach community members the specific steps in recognising and responding to a cardiac arrest, while addressing commonly known barriers and fears related to bystander response. The tailored program and delivery format addressed the needs of individuals of diverse ages, cultural backgrounds, and varied training needs and preferences.The study highlights the importance of community engagement in intervention development and demonstrates the need of evidence-based and collaborative approaches in creating a comprehensive, localised, relatively low-cost intervention package to improve bystander response to OHCA."

Whether retinoic acid also maintains cardiac health under physiological conditions is unknown. However, vitamin A status and intake of its carotenoid precursor β-carotene have been linked to the prevention of heart diseases. Here, we provide in vitro and in vivo evidence that retinoic acid regulates cardiac Pdk4 expression and thus PDH activity. Furthermore, we show that mice lacking β-carotene 9',10'-oxygenase (BCO2), the only enzyme of the adult heart that cleaves β-carotene to generate retinoids (vitamin A and its derivatives), displayed cardiac retinoic acid insufficiency and impaired metabolic flexibility linked to a compromised PDK4/PDH pathway. These findings provide novel insights into the functions of retinoic acid in regulating energy metabolism in adult tissues, especially the heart."
https://openalex.org/W4293101394,"A previous report demonstrated the strong association between the presence of antibodies binding to an epitope region from SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid, termed Ep9, and COVID-19 disease severity. Patients with anti-Ep9 antibodies (Abs) had hallmarks of antigenic interference (AIN), including early IgG upregulation and cytokine-associated injury. Thus, the immunological memory of a prior infection was hypothesized to drive formation of suboptimal anti-Ep9 Abs in severe COVID-19 infections. This study identifies a putative primary antigen capable of stimulating production of cross-reactive, anti-Ep9 Abs. Binding assays with patient blood samples directly show cross-reactivity between Abs binding to Ep9 and only one bioinformatics-derived, homologous putative antigen, a sequence derived from the neuraminidase protein of H3N2 influenza A virus. This cross-reactive binding is highly influenza strain specific and sensitive to even single amino acid changes in epitope sequence. The neuraminidase protein is not present in the influenza vaccine, and the anti-Ep9 Abs likely resulted from the widespread influenza infection in 2014. Therefore, AIN from a previous infection could underlie some cases of COVID-19 disease severity."
https://openalex.org/W4293102098,"Background Malnutrition is a major public health problem because of the devastating consequences it has on children, their families, and society at large. Our study, therefore, sought to determine the prevalence of undernutrition and overweight/obesity and its associated factors among children aged 6–12 in the South Tongu District, Ghana. Methods A school-based cross-sectional study was conducted among 423 school children aged 6–12 years in the South Tongu District of Ghana. A multistage sampling method was employed to recruit the school children for the study. A semi-structured questionnaire was used to collect data from the respondents. We used a dual-purpose (height and weight) measuring scale to obtain the anthropometric data. The World Health Organization’s AnthroPlus software was used to generate the z-scores for determining the nutritional status. Percentages were used to present the results of the prevalence of undernutrition and overweight/obesity among school children. Bivariate and multivariable binary logistic regression were used to examine the factors associated with undernutrition and overweight/obesity among school children. The results were presented as crude odds ratios (CORs) and adjusted odds ratios (AORs), with their 95% confidence interval (CI). Statistical significance was set at p&lt;0.05. Stata 16.0 was used to perform the analyses. Results The overall prevalence of undernutrition and overweight/obesity were 21.5% (CI = 17.7, 25.7) and 24.8% (CI = 20.8, 29.2), respectively. Specifically, the prevalence of stunting, thinness, underweight, overweight, and obesity were 10.4%, 12.1%, 3.8%, 11.1%, and 13.7%, respectively. School children whose household used water from non-portable sources were more likely to be undernourished [AOR = 2.03, 95% CI = 1.13, 3.63]. The odds of overweight/obesity was higher among school children whose mothers had attained formal education [AOR = 2.10, 95% CI = 1.09, 4.06], those who consumed beverages between meals per day [AOR = 1.87, CI = 1.08, 3.24], and those who had adequate dietary diversity score [AOR = 1.65, 95% CI = 1.02, 2.67]. School children aged 10–12 were less likely to be overweight/obese [AOR = 0.58, 95% CI = 0.35, 0.94] compared to those aged 6–9. Conclusion The study showed a relatively high prevalence of undernutrition and overweight/obesity among school children in the South Tongu District. The identified risk factor(s) for undernutrition was the usage of water from non-potable sources whilst those of overweight/obesity were age (10–12 years), maternal formal education, beverage consumption between meals per day, and adequate dietary diversity. The findings reaffirm that malnutrition is still prevalent among school children. Hence, there is a need for the Ministry of Health, Ghana Education Service, and other Non-Governmental Organizations to pay critical attention to these factors to achieve the Sustainable Development Goal 2, target 2.2. Nutritional behavioural change education should be carried out among parents and school children. School health service activities should be intensified with a special focus on nutritional screening."
https://openalex.org/W4293102228,"Bone formation is dependent on the osteoblasts which are differentiated from bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs). In addition to potent proliferation, self-renewal, and pluripotent differentiation, BMSCs have been extensively studied due to their low immunogenicity and immunomodulatory effects. Recently, galectin-1 (Gal-1) has been proposed as a potent mediator of immunomodulatory properties of BMSCs. Previous study demonstrated that Gal-1 showed age-related decline in mice serum and serum Gal-1 was positively associated with bone mass in mice. The current study makes attempts to elucidate the functional role of Gal-1 in skeletal system by investigating the regulation of Gal-1 expression during BMSCs osteogenic differentiation and the molecular mechanisms underlying the effects of Gal-1 on BMSCs osteogenic differentiation. In Gal-1 null (−/−) mice, bone loss was observed due to bone formation attenuation. In in vitro experiments, Gal-1 supported the osteogenic differentiation of BMSCs by binding to CD146 to activate Lrp5 expression and Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway. Meanwhile, there was positive feedback regulation via Wnt/β-catenin signaling to maintain Gal-1 high-level expression during osteogenic differentiation of BMSCs. More importantly, Gal-1 down-regulation in BMSCs and attenuation of osteogenic differentiation potential of BMSCs were observed in aged mice compared with young mice. Gal-1 over-expression could enhance osteogenic differentiation potential of aged BMSCs. Our study will benefit not only for deeper insights into the functional role of Gal-1 but also for finding new targets to modulate BMSCs osteogenic differentiation."
https://openalex.org/W4293102911,"The World Health Organization has identified vaccine hesitancy as one of its top ten global health threats for 2019. Efforts are underway to define the factors responsible for reductions in vaccine confidence. However, as global measles cases accelerated beginning in 2018, it became evident that additional factors were promoting measles re-emergence, including war, political and socio-economic collapse, shifting poverty, and vulnerability to weather events and climate change. Accordingly, we propose a Global Vaccine Risk Index (VRI) to consider these variables as a more comprehensive means to identify vulnerable nations where we might expect measles and other vaccine-preventable diseases to emerge or re-emerge. In Sub-Saharan African and Middle Eastern nations, conflict and political instability predominated as the basis for high vaccine risk scores, whereas in Southeast Asian countries, the major reasons included climate variability, current levels of measles vaccination coverage, and economic and educational disparities. In Europe, low vaccine confidence and refugee movements predominated, while in the Americas, economic disparities and vaccine confidence were important. The VRI may serve as a useful indicator and predictor for international agencies committed to childhood immunizations and might find relevance for accelerating future COVID19 vaccination programs."

We used solid-phase microextraction (SPME) plus gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and gas chromatography-flame ionization detection (GC-FID) to substantially expand rectal gland chemical characterisation of the Queensland fruit fly ( Bactrocera tryoni (Diptera: Tephritidae); Qfly). The SPME GC-MS analysis identified 24 of the 30 compounds previously recorded from Qfly rectal glands, plus another 21 compounds that had not previously been reported. A few amides and fatty acid esters dominated the chromatograms of males and females respectively, but we also found other esters, alcohols and aldehydes and a ketone. The GC-FID analyses also revealed over 150 others, as yet unidentified, volatiles, generally in lesser amounts. The GC-FID analyses also showed 49 and 12 compounds were male- and female-specific, respectively, both in single sex (virgin) and mixed sex (mostly mated) groups. Another ten compounds were male-specific among virgins but undetected in mixed sex groups, and 29 were undetected in virgins but male-specific in mixed sex groups. The corresponding figures for females were four and zero, respectively. Most short retention time peaks (including a ketone and an ester) were male-specific, whereas most female-biased peaks (including five fatty acid esters) had long retention times. Our results indicate previously unsuspected diversity of rectal gland volatiles that might have pheromone functions in males, but far fewer in females."

Antimicrobial resistant (AMR) E . coli originating from dogs may directly or indirectly cause disease in humans. The objective of this study was to calculate the proportion of antimicrobial susceptible E . coli isolated from canine specimens submitted to the Indiana Animal Disease Diagnostic Laboratory and to identify temporal patterns of susceptibility among these isolates. Susceptibility data of 2,738 E . coli isolates from dogs from 2010 through 2019 were used in this study. Proportions of isolates susceptible to the various antimicrobials were calculated using SAS statistical software and the Cochran-Armitage trend test was used to investigate the temporal trends in susceptibility. A multivariable binary logistic regression model was built to investigate the association between host factors and AMR. Overall, 553/2,738 (20.2%) of the isolates were susceptible to 17 of the 27 antimicrobials examined. Of the 2,638 isolates examined for amikacin susceptibility, 2,706 (97.5%) were susceptible, 2,657/2,673 (99.4%) isolates were susceptible to imipenem, and 2,099/2,670 (78.6%) were susceptible to marbofloxacin. A significant decreasing trend in susceptibility was observed for amoxicillin-clavulanic acid ( P &lt;0.0001), ampicillin ( P &lt;0.0001), Cefazolin ( P &lt;0.0001), ceftazidime ( P = 0.0067), chloramphenicol ( P &lt;0.0001), and orbifloxacin ( P = 0.008). The overall percentage of AMR isolates (isolates not susceptible to at least one antimicrobial) was 61.7% (1,690/2,738) and 29.3% (801/2,738) of isolates were multidrug resistant. Multivariable regression analyses showed significant associations between AMR and age ( P = 0.0091), breed ( P = 0.0008), and sample isolation site/source ( P &lt;0.0001). The decreasing trend in the proportion of isolates susceptible to several beta-lactam antimicrobials suggests that resistance of Escherichia coli in dogs to these antimicrobials could be increasing in Indiana. The decreasing trend in susceptibility to these drugs could be due to selection pressure from antimicrobial use."

https://openalex.org/W4293105161,"To describe survival according to prognostic factors of women with breast cancer in French overseas territory (Martinique) during 2008–2017. We performed a Cox model for prognostic factors for OS in breast cancer patients. The cut-off date for the analysis was 13/10/2018. The main factors were demographic data, stage, hormone receptors (HR) status and HER2 status. Curves were compared with the log rank test to select candidate variables for the multivariate analysis. We included 1,708 patients; median age at diagnosis was 57 years. Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) accounted for 20.9% (n = 332). Among the patients, 72.3% (n = 1015) had localised or local spread cancer. One-year OS was 95.2% and was 80.1% at 5 years. In TNBC, 1-year-survival was 90.4%, which fell to 70.1% at 5 years. Patients with metastatic disease at diagnosis had 1-year-survival of 74.5%, and 20.1% at 5 years. Multivariate analysis by Cox regression identified 4 factors significantly associated with an increased risk of death: metastatic disease at diagnosis (hazard ratio (HR) = 15, p&lt;0.0001), TNBC (HR 2.84, p&lt;0.0001), HR+/HER2- status (HR 2.05, p&lt;0.0084) and age &gt;75 years (HR 3.8, p&lt;0.0001).

https://openalex.org/W4293105591,"Background SARS-CoV-2 has been spreading worldwide since late 2019. Before vaccines became available, exclusively non-pharmaceutical measures were used to prevent transmission of infection. Despite the fact that vaccinations are now available, it is still important to identify relevant transmission routes in order to contain the COVID-19- or further pandemics. Therefore, this study aims to systematically analyse data from the largest public health department in Germany to determine the significance of the various known and unknown transmission situations in terms of the proportion of infections. Methods All infections in Cologne were systematically recorded by the local health department. In addition to clinical data, the transmission situations were recorded and categorised as pertaining to social contact, work contact, travellers, health care workers, users of educational institutions, visitors of community institutions, infection in the context of medical treatment, and unknown infection. Findings The analysis included 25,966 persons. A transmission situation could be identified in 82.7% of the cases (n = 21,477). Most persons (42.1%) were infected due to social contact, primarily within their own household. Another 22.3% were infected at their place of work; this was particularly common among staff members of medical facilities, nursing homes and educational institutions. In 17.3% of the cases, the transmission situation remained unknown; the cases with unknown transmission situation were slightly more often symptomatic (75.2%) than the cases with known transmission situation (69.4%). Interpretation Considering that during the study period the leading strains were the wild-type and alpha-variant transmission rather occurred during scenarios involving close contacts than in anonymous situations. Presumably, however, the findings can be transferred to the new variants. Therefore, in order to prevent transmission, besides vaccination regular antigen tests and/or appropriate protective measures remain relevant until this pandemic has subsided."
https://openalex.org/W4293051846,"As a surveillance mechanism, the activated spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC) potently inhibits the E3 ubiquitin ligase APC/C (anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome) to ensure accurate chromosome segregation. Although the protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) has been proposed to be both, directly and indirectly, involved in spindle assembly checkpoint inactivation in mammalian cells, whether it is similarly operating in the fission yeast Schizosaccharomycer pombe has never been demonstrated. Here, we investigated whether fission yeast PP2A is involved in SAC silencing by following the rate of cyclin B (Cdc13) destruction at SPBs during the recovery phase in nda3-KM311 cells released from the inhibition of APC/C by the activated spindle checkpoint. The timing of the SAC inactivation is only slightly delayed when two B56 regulatory subunits (Par1 and Par2) of fission yeast PP2A are absent. Overproduction of individual PP2A subunits either globally in the nda3-KM311 arrest-and-release system or locally in the synthetic spindle checkpoint activation system only slightly suppresses the SAC silencing defects in PP1 deletion (dis2Δ) cells. Our study thus demonstrates that the fission yeast PP2A is not a key regulator actively involved in SAC inactivation."

The purpose of this study was to assess the relationship between fetal insulin, insulin-like Growth factor-1(IGF-1), and macrosomia in a resource-limited setting.This was a case-control study at tertiary and secondary health facilities in Lagos, Nigeria. One hundred and fifty mother-neonate pairs were recruited, and their socio-demographic and obstetric history was recorded. Fetal cord venous blood was collected at birth, and neonatal anthropometry was measured within 24hrs of life. Insulin and IGF-1 assay were measured with Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA). Pearson's Chi-square was used to assess the association between categorical variables and macrosomia. Spearman's rank correlation of insulin, IGF-1, and fetal anthropometry was performed. Multivariable logistic regression was used to evaluate the association of insulin and IGF-1 with fetal birth weight. A statistically significant level was set at P-value < 0.05.Macrosomic neonates had mean fetal weight, fetal length, and occipitofrontal circumference (OFC) of 4.15±0.26kg, 50.85±2.09cm and 36.35± 1.22cm respectively. The median Insulin (P = 0.023) and IGF-1 (P < 0.0001) were significantly higher among macrosomic neonates as compared to normal weight babies. Maternal BMI at birth (p = 0.003), neonate's gender (p < 0.001), fetal cord serum IGF-1 (p < 0.001) and insulin assay (P-value = 0.027) were significant predictors of fetal macrosomia. There was positive correlation between cord blood IGF-1 and birth weight (r = 0.47, P-value < 0.001), fetal length (r = 0.30, P-value = 0.0002) and OFC (r = 0.37, P-value < 0.001).Among participating mother-neonate dyad, maternal BMI at birth, neonate's gender, and fetal cord serum IGF-1 and serum insulin are significantly associated with fetal macrosomia."
https://openalex.org/W4293102693,"Sports such as diving, gymnastics, and ice skating rely on expert judges to score performance accurately. Human error and bias can affect the scores, sometimes leading to controversy, especially at high levels. Instant replay or recorded video can be used to assess judges’ scores, or sometimes update judges’ scores, during a competition. For diving in particular, judges are trained to look for certain characteristics of a dive, such as angle of entry, height of splash, and distance of the dive from the end of the board, to score each dive on a scale of 0 to 10, where a 0 is a failed dive and a 10 is a perfect dive. In an effort to obtain objective comparisons for judges’ scores, a diving meet was filmed and the video footage used to measure certain characteristics of each dive for each participant. The variables measured from the video were height of the dive at its apex, angle of entry into the water, and distance of the dive from the end of the board. The measured items were then used as explanatory variables in a regression model where the judge’s scores were the response. The measurements from the video are gathered to provide a gold standard that is specific to the athletic performances at the meet being judged, and supplement judges’ scores with synergistic quantitative and visual information. In this article we show, via a series of regression analyses, that certain aspects of an athlete’s performance measured from video after a meet provide similar information to the judges’ scores. The model was shown to fit the data well enough to warrant use of characteristics from video footage to supplement judges’ scores in future meets. In addition, we calibrated the results from the model against those of meets where the same divers competed to show that the measurement data ranks divers in approximately the same order as they were ranked in other meets, showing meet to meet consistency in measured data and judges’ scores. Eventually, our findings could lead to use of video footage to supplement judges’ scores in real time."
https://openalex.org/W4293102757,"Mechanisms and consequences of gasdermin D (GSDMD) activation in cigarette smoke (CS)-associated inflammation and lung disease are unknown. GSDMD is a downstream effector of caspase-1, -8, and -4. Upon cleavage, GSDMD generates pores into cell membranes. Different degrees of GSDMD activation are associated with a range of physiological outputs ranging from cell hyperactivation to pyroptosis. We have previously reported that in human monocyte-derived macrophages CS extract (CSE) inhibits the NLRP3 inflammasome and shifts the response to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) towards the TLR4-TRIF axis leading to activation of caspase-8, which, in turn, activates caspase-1. In the present work, we investigated whether other ASC-dependent inflammasomes could be involved in caspase activation by CSE and whether caspase activation led to GSDMD cleavage and other downstream effects. Presented results demonstrate that CSE promoted ASC-independent activation of caspase-1 leading to GSDMD cleavage and increased cell permeability, in the absence of cell death. GSDMD cleavage was strongly enhanced upon stimulation with LPS+CSE, suggesting a synergistic effect between the two stimuli. Noteworthy, CSE promoted LPS internalization leading to caspase-4 activation, thus contributing to increased GSDMD cleavage. Caspase-dependent GSDMD cleavage was associated with mitochondrial superoxide generation. Increased cleaved GSDMD was found in lung macrophages of smokers compared to ex-smokers and non-smoking controls. Our findings revealed that ASC-independent activation of caspase-1, -4, and -8 and GSDMD cleavage upon exposure to CS may contribute to macrophage dysfunction and feed the chronic inflammation observed in the smokers' lung."

https://openalex.org/W4293104285,"The use of trait-based approaches to understand ecological communities has increased in the past two decades because of their promise to preserve more information about community structure than taxonomic methods and their potential to connect community responses to subsequent effects of ecosystem functioning. Though trait-based approaches are a powerful tool for describing ecological communities, many important properties of commonly-used trait metrics remain unexamined. Previous work in studies that simulate communities and trait distributions show consistent sensitivity of functional richness and evenness measures to the number of traits used to calculate them, but these relationships have yet to be studied in actual plant communities with a realistic distribution of trait values, ecologically meaningful covariation of traits, and a realistic number of traits available for analysis. Therefore, we propose to test how the number of traits used and the correlation between traits used in the calculation of functional diversity indices impacts the magnitude of eight functional diversity metrics in real plant communities. We will use trait data from three grassland plant communities in the US to assess the generality of our findings across ecosystems and experiments. We will determine how eight functional diversity metrics (functional richness, functional evenness, functional divergence, functional dispersion, kernel density estimation (KDE) richness, KDE evenness, KDE dispersion, Rao’s Q) differ based on the number of traits used in the metric calculation and on the correlation of traits when holding the number of traits constant. Without a firm understanding of how a scientist’s choices impact these metric, it will be difficult to compare results among studies with different metric parametrization and thus, limit robust conclusions about functional composition of communities across systems."
