https://openalex.org/W1968400976,"The role of iron in enhancing phytoplankton productivity in high nutrient, low chlorophyll oceanic regions was demonstrated first through iron-addition bioassay experiments and subsequently confirmed by large-scale iron fertilization experiments. Iron supply has been hypothesized to limit nitrogen fixation and hence oceanic primary productivity on geological timescales, providing an alternative to phosphorus as the ultimate limiting nutrient. Oceanographic observations have been interpreted both to confirm and refute this hypothesis, but direct experimental evidence is lacking. We conducted experiments to test this hypothesis during the Meteor 55 cruise to the tropical North Atlantic. This region is rich in diazotrophs and strongly impacted by Saharan dust input. Here we show that community primary productivity was nitrogen-limited, and that nitrogen fixation was co-limited by iron and phosphorus. Saharan dust addition stimulated nitrogen fixation, presumably by supplying both iron and phosphorus. Our results support the hypothesis that aeolian mineral dust deposition promotes nitrogen fixation in the eastern tropical North Atlantic."

However, the mechanisms of action are poorly understood. It is shown here that the combination of O2−⋅ with guanine neutral radicals, G(–H)• in single- or double-stranded oligodeoxyribonucleotides (rate constant of 4.7 ± 1.0 × 108m–1 s–1 in both cases), culminates in the formation of oxidatively modified guanine bases (major product, imidazolone; minor product, 8-oxo-7,8-dihydroguanine). The G(–H)• and O2−⋅ radicals were generated by intense 308 nm excimer laser pulses resulting in the one-electron oxidation and deprotonation of guanine in the 5′-d(CC[2AP]-TCGCTACC) strands and the trapping of the ejected electrons by molecular oxygen (Shafirovich, V., Dourandin, A., Huang, W., Luneva, N. P., and Geacintov, N. E. (2000) Phys. Chem. Chem. Phys. 2, 4399–4408). The addition of Cu,Zn-superoxide dismutase, known to react rapidly with superoxide, dramatically enhances the life-times of guanine radicals from 4 to 7 ms to 0.2–0.6 s in the presence of 5 μm superoxide dismutase. Oxygen-18 isotope labeling experiments reveal two pathways of 8-oxo-7,8-dihydroguanine formation including either addition of O2−⋅ to the C-8 position of G(–H)• (in the presence of oxygen), or the hydration of G(–H)• (in the absence of oxygen). The formation of the guanine lesions via combination of guanine and superoxide radicals is greatly reduced in the presence of typical antioxidants such as trolox and catechol that rapidly regenerate guanine by the reductive “repair” of G(–H)• radicals. The mechanistic aspects of the radical reactions that either regenerate undamaged guanine in DNA or lead to oxidatively modified guanine bases are discussed.

It is shown here that the combination of O2−⋅ with guanine neutral radicals, G(–H)• in single- or double-stranded oligodeoxyribonucleotides (rate constant of 4.7 ± 1.0 × 108m–1 s–1 in both cases), culminates in the formation of oxidatively modified guanine bases (major product, imidazolone; minor product, 8-oxo-7,8-dihydroguanine).

The mechanistic aspects of the radical reactions that either regenerate undamaged guanine in DNA or lead to oxidatively modified guanine bases are discussed. Guanine is the most easily oxidizable nucleic acid base in DNA (1Steenken S. Jovanovic S.V. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1997; 119: 617-618Google Scholar) and is therefore a primary target of oxidative modification (2Cadet J. Bellon S. Berger M. Bourdat A.G. Douki T. Duarte V. Frelon S. Gasparutto D. Muller E. Ravanat J.L. Sauvaigo S. Biol. Chem. Hoppe-Seyler. 2002; 383: 933-943Google Scholar). In neutral aqueous solutions, the one-electron oxidation of guanine residues first produces the guanine radical cation (G·+)1 1The abbreviations used are: G·+, guanine radical cation; G(–H)•, guanine neutral radical; 2AP+, 2-aminopurine radical cation; 2AP(–H)•, 2-aminopurine neutral radical; dG, 2′-deoxyguanosine; dGMP, 2′-deoxyguanosine 5′-monophosphate; 8-oxoGua, 8-oxo-7,8-dihydroguanine; 8-oxodGuo, 8-oxo-7,8-dihydro-2′-deoxyguanosine, Iz, 2,5-diamino-4H-imidazolone; dZ, 2,2-diamino-4-[(2-deoxy-β-d-erythro-pentofuranosyl)amino]-2,5-dihydrooxazol-5-one; O2−⋅, superoxide radical dismutase; anion; SOD, superoxide MALDI-TOF, matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization with time-of-flight detection; MS, mass-spectrometry; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography; BQ, 1,4-benzoquinone. that rapidly deprotonates to yield the guanine neutral radical, G(–H)• (3Steenken S. Chem. Rev. 1989; 89: 503-520Google Scholar, 4Steenken S. Biol. Chem. Hoppe-Seyler. 1997; 378: 1293-1297Google Scholar). The interactions of G(–H)• with other reactive species have long been of interest. Electron paramagnetic resonance studies performed in neutral aqueous solutions at room temperature have shown that, in the absence of specific reactive molecules, the lifetime of the G(–H)• radicals in calf thymus DNA is as long as ∼5 s (5Hildenbrand K. Schulte-Frohlinde D. Free Radic. Res. Commun. 1990; 11: 195-206Google Scholar). Our own laser flash photolysis studies have shown that the lifetimes of G(–H)• radicals generated by the oxidation of G residues in 16-mer double-stranded oligonucleotides by carbonate radical anions are about 0.3 s, even in air-equilibrated neutral aqueous solutions (6Shafirovich V. Dourandin A. Huang W. Geacintov N.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 24621-24626Google Scholar). Thus, the G(–H)• radicals embedded in DNA do not react to any observable extent with molecular oxygen. It is therefore of interest to explore the fates of these long lived G(–H)• radicals in DNA in the presence of selected reactive species that rapidly combine with this radical, thus shortening its lifetime. In this work we explored the possibility that the superoxide radical anion ( O2−⋅), unlike molecular oxygen, can rapidly react with the G(–H)• radicals in DNA via a bimolecular combination reaction. The lifetimes of these radicals are significantly diminished in the presence of superoxide, and these bimolecular reactions ultimately yield stable guanine oxidation products. The superoxide radical is an important biological intermediate that is formed in living cells (7Fridovich I. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 97-112Google Scholar, 8Fridovich I. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18515-18517Google Scholar, 9Valentine J.S. Hart P.J. Gralla E.B. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 1999; 448: 193-203Google Scholar) and also in ionization reactions that generate electrons that are then rapidly captured by dissolved oxygen in aqueous solutions (e.g. Ref. 10Buxton G.V. Greenstock C.L. Helman W.P. Ross A.B. J. Phys. Chem. Ref. Data. 1988; 17: 513-886Google Scholar). In living systems, superoxide radicals, the products of normal metabolic activity, are rapidly deactivated by superoxide dismutases (SOD) that catalyze the conversion of O2−⋅ to the less reactive H2O2 and O2 (7Fridovich I. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 97-112Google Scholar, 8Fridovich I. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18515-18517Google Scholar, 9Valentine J.S. Hart P.J. Gralla E.B. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 1999; 448: 193-203Google Scholar). The pioneering work of Fridovich and co-workers (11Klug D. Rabani J. Fridovich I. J. Biol. Chem. 1972; 247: 4839-4842Google Scholar) and Fielden and co-workers (12Rotilio G. Bray R.C. Fielden E.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1972; 268: 605-609Google Scholar), based on pulse radiolysis techniques, showed that the catalytic reaction of SOD with O2−⋅ occurs with nearly diffusion-controlled rates. However, in tissues subjected to chronic infection and inflammation, the consumption of molecular oxygen is enhanced, and O2−⋅ radicals are overproduced (13Grisham M.B. Jourd'heuil D. Wink D.A. Aliment. Pharmacol. Ther. 2000; 14: 3-9Google Scholar, 14Halliwell B. Mutat. Res. 1999; 443: 37-52Google Scholar). Hence, whenever G(–H)• radicals in DNA are formed by oxidative one-electron transfer mechanisms followed by deprotonation (3Steenken S. Chem. Rev. 1989; 89: 503-520Google Scholar, 4Steenken S. Biol. Chem. Hoppe-Seyler. 1997; 378: 1293-1297Google Scholar), the reactive combination of G(–H)• with O2−⋅ should be feasible in vivo, especially under conditions of oxidative stress. Surprisingly, the combination reaction of O2−⋅ and G(–H)• radicals in DNA has not yet been explored by direct time-resolved spectroscopic techniques. Thus, neither the rates of such reactions nor the nature of the oxidation products formed have been investigated. A laser flash photolysis method developed by our group (15Shafirovich V. Dourandin A. Huang W. Luneva N.P. Geacintov N.E. J. Phys. Chem. 1999; 103: 10924-10933Google Scholar, 16Shafirovich V. Dourandin A. Huang W. Luneva N.P. Geacintov N.E. Phys. Chem. Chem. Phys. 2000; 2: 4399-4408Google Scholar, 17Shafirovich V. Dourandin A. Geacintov N.E. J. Phys. Chem. 2001; 105: 8431-8435Google Scholar) was employed to generate O2−⋅ and G(–H)• radicals in DNA. This method involves the site-specific incorporation of a single 2-aminopurine (2AP) residue, a nucleic acid base analog, into oligo-2′-deoxyribonucleotide strands containing a single G residue. The 2AP residues, either in single- or double-stranded oligonucleotides in aqueous solutions, are selectively photoionized with intense 308 nm excimer laser pulses (∼12 ns) by a two-photon absorption mechanism, thus yielding 2AP·+ radical cations (Fig. 1). Because the 2AP absorption band extends beyond 300 nm, the normal DNA nucleobases are not ionized under these conditions. The 2AP+. radicals rapidly deprotonate to yield the neutral 2AP(–H)• radicals. Both the radical cation and the neutral radical forms are strong one-electron oxidants that are capable of oxidizing guanines even when the 2AP and guanine residues are separated by varying numbers of intervening bases (15Shafirovich V. Dourandin A. Huang W. Luneva N.P. Geacintov N.E. J. Phys. Chem. 1999; 103: 10924-10933Google Scholar, 16Shafirovich V. Dourandin A. Huang W. Luneva N.P. Geacintov N.E. Phys. Chem. Chem. Phys. 2000; 2: 4399-4408Google Scholar, 17Shafirovich V. Dourandin A. Geacintov N.E. J. Phys. Chem. 2001; 105: 8431-8435Google Scholar). In the presence of molecular oxygen, the hydrated electrons derived from the photoionization of 2AP are rapidly and quantitatively scavenged by dissolved O2 to generate superoxide radicals (10Buxton G.V. Greenstock C.L. Helman W.P. Ross A.B. J. Phys. Chem. Ref. Data. 1988; 17: 513-886Google Scholar). Thus, two-photon photoexcitation of DNA strands with site-specifically positioned 2AP and G bases in oxygen-saturated aqueous solutions provides a very convenient approach for exploring the kinetics of combination G(–H)• and O2−⋅ and to subsequently study the oxidative end products arising from this reaction (Fig. 1). In this study, the oligonucleotide 5′-d(CC[2AP]TCGCTACC) was employed. The electron transfer step from G to the 2AP radicals occurs over a bridge of 2 bases and is rather efficient in oligonucleotides of analogous sequences (15Shafirovich V. Dourandin A. Huang W. Luneva N.P. Geacintov N.E. J. Phys. Chem. 1999; 103: 10924-10933Google Scholar, 16Shafirovich V. Dourandin A. Huang W. Luneva N.P. Geacintov N.E. Phys. Chem. Chem. Phys. 2000; 2: 4399-4408Google Scholar). The formation of the G(–H)• radicals and their disappearance by reaction with O2−⋅ radicals were monitored by transient absorption spectros-copy. The efficiency of formation of oxidatively damaged oligonucleotides, separated and purified by reversed-phase HPLC analysis of the irradiated oligonucleotides, was investigated, and the major products were identified by MALDI-TOF/MS analysis. The major product found was the 5-diamino-4H-imidazolone (Iz) lesion, and the 8-oxo-7,8-dihydroguanine (8-oxoGua) nucleobase was also formed, but in minor quantities. The yields of these guanine lesions were significantly decreased in the presence of typical antioxidants, such as trolox and catechol, added before the irradiation. The formation of DNA oxidation products is also suppressed by 1,4-benzoquinone, an efficient scavenger of superoxide radicals. Materials—All chemicals (analytical grade) were used as received. Nuclease P1, acid phosphatase from potato, and alkaline phosphatase were purchased from Sigma; Cu,Zn-superoxide dismutase was from Roche Applied Science; and H218O (95% of 18O) was from Icon Isotopes (Summit, NJ). The oligonucleotides were synthesized by standard automated phosphoramidite chemistry techniques. Phosphoramidites and other chemicals required for the oligonucleotide synthesis were obtained from Glen Research (Sterling, VA). The tritylated oligonucleotides were deprotected overnight at 55 °C employing concentrated aqueous ammonia solutions. The crude oligonucleotides were purified by reversed-phase HPLC, detritylated in 80% acetic acid according to standard protocols, and desalted using reversed-phase HPLC. The integrity and composition of the oligonucleotides were confirmed by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. Laser Flash Photolysis—The transient absorption spectra and kinetics of free radical reactions were monitored directly by using a fully computerized kinetic spectrometer system (∼7-ns response time) described elsewhere (15Shafirovich V. Dourandin A. Huang W. Luneva N.P. Geacintov N.E. J. Phys. Chem. 1999; 103: 10924-10933Google Scholar). Briefly, 308 nm nanosecond XeCl excimer laser pulses (∼12-ns pulse width, 1-Hz repetition rate, 60-mJ pulse–1 cm–2) were used to photolyse sample solutions (0.25 ml) of the oligonucleotides saturated with molecular oxygen under normal atmospheric conditions ([O2] ∼1.3 mm). The transient absorbance was probed along a 1-cm optical path by a light from a 75-watt xenon arc lamp with its light beam oriented perpendicular to the laser beam. After each actinic laser shot and recording of the transient absorption profile at a particular wavelength, the irradiated sample in the 0.4 × 1 cm quartz cell was replaced by a portion of the fresh solution using a computer-controlled flow system. The signal was recorded by a Tektronix TDS 5052 oscilloscope operating in its high resolution mode that allowed for satisfactory signal/noise ratios even after a single laser shot; when necessary, the kinetic traces were averaged over 10 laser flashes using a fresh sample solution for each laser shot. The second order rate constants of the oxidative reactions initiated by free radicals were typically determined by least squares fits of the appropriate kinetic equations to the transient absorption profiles obtained in five different experiments with five different samples. The rate constant of O2−⋅ oxidation by superoxide dismutase was obtained from a numerical analysis of the time-dependent decay of the transient absorption profiles of the G(–H)• radicals that reacted with residual superoxide radicals at different concentrations of superoxide dismutase. This analysis was performed using the PRKIN and INTKIN computer programs developed by H. Schwartz at the Brookhaven National Laboratory. HPLC Purification—After the irradiation experiments, the modified oligonucleotides were separated from the unmodified ones by reversed-phase HPLC by using an analytical (250 × 4.6 mm inner diameter) Hypersil ODS column (Varian, Walnut Creek, CA). In typical separations, a 10–20% linear gradient of acetonitrile in 50 mm triethylammonium acetate in water (pH 7) for 60 min was employed at a flow rate of 1 ml/min (detection of products at 260 nm). The HPLC fractions were evaporated under vacuum to remove acetonitrile and purified by a second HPLC cycle. The purified adducts were desalted by reversed-phase HPLC using the following mobile phases: 10 mm ammonium acetate (10 min), deionized water (10 min), and an isocratic 50:50 acetonitrile and H2O mixture (15 min) and subjected for MALDI-TOF/MS analysis. MALDI-TOF/MS Assay of Oligonucleotides—The mass spectra were acquired using a Bruker OmniFLEX instrument. The matrix was a 2:1 mixture of 2′,4′,6′-trihydroxyacetophenone methanol solution (30 mg/ml) and ammonium citrate aqueous solution (100 mg/ml). The aliquots (1–2 μl) of the 10 pmol/μl desalted samples and the matrix solution were spotted on a MALDI target and air-dried before analysis. The mass spectrometer equipped with a 337 nm nitrogen laser was operated in the negative linear mode (accelerating voltage 19 kV, extraction voltage 92.7% of the accelerating voltage, ion focus 9 kV, and delay time 250 ns). Each spectrum was obtained with an average of 50–100 laser shots. The mass spectra were internally calibrated by using synthetic oligonucleotides of known molecular weights. Identification of Imidazolone Lesions—Irradiated oligonucleotide solutions were stored in the dark at room temperature for 48 h in order to allow for the conversion of the Iz lesion to the 2,2,4-triamino-5-(2H)-oxazolone (Z) lesion (18Gasparutto D. Ravanat J.-L. Gerot O. Cadet J. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1998; 120: 10283-10286Google Scholar). After desalting by reversed-phase HPLC, the oligonucleotide samples (5 nmol) were incubated with nuclease P1 (12 units) and potato acid phosphatase (2 units) in 50 μl of 30 mm acetate buffer (pH 5.2) containing 0.1 mm ZnCl2 for 2 h at 37 °C. The digestion mixture was passed through a Millipore centrifugal filter to remove enzymes and subjected to HPLC-MS/MS analysis. The authentic 2-amino-5-[(2-deoxy-β-d-erythro-pentofuranosyl)amino]-4H-imidazol-4-one was synthesized by photosensitization of 2′-deoxyguanosine (dG) with benzophenone, isolated by reversed-phase HPLC, and converted to 2,2-diamino-4-[(2-deoxy-β-d-erythro-pentofuranosyl)amino]-2,5-dihydrooxazol-5-one (dZ) as described earlier (19Raoul S. Berger M. Buchko G.W. Joshi P.C. Morin B. Weinfeld M. Cadet J. J. Chem. Soc. Perkin Trans. 1996; 2: 371-381Google Scholar). Quantitation of Oxazolone Lesions—The Z lesions obtained by the hydrolysis of the Iz lesions were detected by the post-fluorescence HPLC method (20Ravanat J. Berger M. Benard F. Langlois R. Ouellet R. van Lier J.E. Cadet J. Photochem. Photobiol. 1992; 55: 809-814Google Scholar). The irradiated oligonucleotide mixtures (5 nmol) dissolved in 50 μl of water and mixed with 50 μl of 1 m NaOH were incubated at 70 °C for 30 min to release oxazolone from DNA in the form of guanidine. An aqueous solution of 1,2-naphthoquinone-4-sulfonic acid (10 μl, 8 mg/ml) was added to the sample cooled to the room temperature for derivatization of the released guanidine. The reaction mixture was incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. After cooling to room temperature, the sample was neutralized by the addition of 50 μl of 1 m HCl and 50 μl of 0.2 m phosphate buffer (pH 7). The samples were analyzed by reversed-phase HPLC with fluorescence detection (excitation at 355 nm and detection at 405 nm). In typical separations on an analytical (250 × 4.6 mm inner diameter) Hypersil ODS column (Varian), a 5–30% linear gradient of methanol in 25 mm ammonium formate for 60 min was employed at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. The fluorescence detector was calibrated externally using the samples prepared by the derivatization of known quantities of the authentic guanidine hydrochloride; the amounts of oxazolone in the irradiated oligonucleotides were calculated from these calibration curves. The accuracy of this method for the quantitation of the Z lesions was confirmed by an HPLC-MS/MS assay (21Ravanat J.L. Remaud G. Cadet J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2000; 374: 118-127Google Scholar). Detection of 8-OxoGua Lesions—The irradiated oligonucleotide mixtures (10 nmol) were digested with nuclease P1 (2 units) in 35 μl of 30 mm acetate buffer (pH 5.2) for 1.5 h at 37 °C; following digestion, the samples were treated with 2 units of alkaline phosphatase in a Tris-HCl (∼100 mm) buffer solution (pH 8.2) for 1 h at 37 °C. The incubation mixtures were passed through a Millipore centrifugal filter to remove the enzymes. The nucleosides were separated by reversed-phase HPLC using a 0–40% linear gradient of methanol in 20 mm ammonium acetate at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. The amperometric detection (22Berger M. Anselmino C. Mouret J.-F. Cadet J. J. Liq. Chromatogr. 1990; 13: 929-940Google Scholar) of 8-oxo-7,8-dihydro-2′-deoxyguanosine (8-oxodGuo) was performed employing a model 800A electrochemical analyzer (CHI Instruments, Austin, TX). For detection of 8-oxodGuo, the potential of the glassy carbon working electrode was set at 0.6 V versus Ag/AgCl electrode. Quantitation of 8-oxodGuo was performed by injecting known quantities of 8-oxodGuo. The recovery of 8-oxodGuo, determined by enzymatic digestion of an unirradiated 8-oxodGuo-modified oligonucleotide, was about 75–80%. Oxygen-18 Isotope Labeling Experiments—The oligonucleotide samples (10 nmol) in buffer solutions were evaporated to dryness and dissolved in 100 μl of H218O. After irradiation, followed by enzymatic digestion with nuclease P1 and alkaline phosphatase, the fractions containing 8-oxodGuo were isolated by reversed-phase HPLC methods as described above and subjected to HPLC-MS/MS analysis. HPLC-MS/MS Assay of Nucleosides—These experiments were performed by using an LC/MSD-trap XCT spectrometer (Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto, CA) with an Agilent 1100 Series Capillary LC System. 8-OxodGuo was separated from the nucleoside mixture using the adapted protocol from Ref. 23Dizdaroglu M. Jaruga P. Rodriguez H. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: e12Google Scholar. In typical separations on a Zorbax Eclipse XDB-C18 column (150 × 2.1 mm inner diameter), a 1–5% linear gradient of acetonitrile in water for 15 min was employed at a flow rate of 0.2 ml/min. dZ was separated from the nucleoside mixture on a (50 × 2 mm inner diameter) Hypercarb column (Thermo-Hypersil-Keystone, Bellefonte, PA) employing a 1–90% linear gradient of acetonitrile in water with 0.1% formic acid for 40 min at a flow rate of 0.4 ml/min. The mass spectra were recorded in the positive mode. The spectrometer was tuned to maximum sensitivity by the direct infusion of the authentic nucleoside standard solutions. The nebulizer gas pressure was 40 pounds/square inch; the dry gas flow rate was 8.0 liters/min, and the dry temperature was set at 350 °C. For general analytical experiments, the instrument was operated using the “smart” parameter setting, and the detector was set for a particular ion of interest. Mass spectra were obtained by averaging over the area of a particular total ion chromatogram peak, and the background intensity was then subtracted. In the multiple reactions monitoring mode, the detector was set to isolate a number of particular ions of interest, or to monitor the fragmentation of a number of molecular ions. The objectives of this work were to explore the characteristics of the radical-radical combination reaction between G(–H)• and O2−⋅. In this bimolecular reaction, either a hydroperoxide is formed that culminates in the formation of oxidative guanine lesions or guanine is regenerated to its normal state. We refer here to this latter reaction as a “radical-repair” reaction. Following laser pulse excitation, some of the key initial electron transfer and radical-radical combination events that ultimately lead to the formation of the oxidative DNA end products were monitored by transient absorption spectroscopy. Finally, the major products of reaction were identified. The experiments were performed with the oligonucleotide 5′-d(CC[2AP]TCGCTACC) either in the single-stranded or in the double-stranded form. In this oligonucleotide strand, the single G and 2AP residues are separated by two other DNA bases. In 5 mm phosphate buffer solution (pH 7.5) containing 100 mm NaCl, the duplex obtained by annealing the 2AP-modified strand and its natural complementary strand with T opposite 2AP exhibits a single, well defined cooperative melting curve with a melting point Tm of 50.8 ± 0.7 °C and a hyper-chromicity of 25%. Studies with single- and double-stranded oligonucleotides were performed at room temperature (23 ± 2 °C). Kinetics of the G(–H)• and O2·¯ Combination Reaction in DNA—Photoexcitation of the 5′-d(CC[2AP]TCGCTACC) sequence and 5′-d(CC[2AP]TCGCTACC) · 5-d(GGTAGCGATGG) duplex in oxygen-saturated buffer solutions (pH 7.5) with intense 308 nm excimer laser pulses induces selective ionization of the 2AP residues (Fig. 1). The laser flash photolysis experiments showed that the hydrated electrons are scavenged by molecular oxygen, and thus (i) the formation of superoxide radicals and (ii) the oxidation of guanine residues by 2AP radicals is complete within ∼100 μs, in agreement with previous observations (15Shafirovich V. Dourandin A. Huang W. Luneva N.P. Geacintov N.E. J. Phys. Chem. 1999; 103: 10924-10933Google Scholar, 16Shafirovich V. Dourandin A. Huang W. Luneva N.P. Geacintov N.E. Phys. Chem. Chem. Phys. 2000; 2: 4399-4408Google Scholar, 17Shafirovich V. Dourandin A. Geacintov N.E. J. Phys. Chem. 2001; 105: 8431-8435Google Scholar). Therefore, the transient absorption spectra recorded on a millisecond time scale resemble the spectra of guanine neutral radicals (Fig. 2). The G(–H)• radicals can be identified by the appearance of the characteristic narrow absorption band near 315 nm (15Shafirovich V. Dourandin A. Huang W. Luneva N.P. Geacintov N.E. J. Phys. Chem. 1999; 103: 10924-10933Google Scholar, 16Shafirovich V. Dourandin A. Huang W. Luneva N.P. Geacintov N.E. Phys. Chem. Chem. Phys. 2000; 2: 4399-4408Google Scholar, 17Shafirovich V. Dourandin A. Geacintov N.E. J. Phys. Chem. 2001; 105: 8431-8435Google Scholar). The absorption band of O2−⋅ radicals at 250 nm (24Bielski B.H.J. Photochem. Photobiol. 1978; 28: 645-649Google Scholar) overlaps with the strong absorption of DNA at 260 nm and thus cannot be directly observed in these experiments. The maximum amplitudes of the G(–H)• absorbance signals at 315 nm in the duplex (Fig. 2B) were several times smaller than those obtained with the single strand (Fig. 2A). This difference in the signal amplitudes is in agreement with the lower efficiency of the two-photon photoionization of 2AP in the duplexes than in single-stranded oligonucleotides (15Shafirovich V. Dourandin A. Huang W. Luneva N.P. Geacintov N.E. J. Phys. Chem. 1999; 103: 10924-10933Google Scholar, 16Shafirovich V. Dourandin A. Huang W. Luneva N.P. Geacintov N.E. Phys. Chem. Chem. Phys. 2000; 2: 4399-4408Google Scholar). The gradual decay of the G(–H)• radicals (Fig. 2) can be characterized by the change in absorbance at a particular wavelength as a function of time. This decay is attributed to the combination reaction of the G(–H)• and O2−⋅ radicals (Table I, reaction 1), as shown below. The decay of the G(–H)• radicals was recorded at 315 nm in the single strand (Fig. 3A) and in the duplex (Fig. 3B). The time dependence of the absorbance at time t, At, is described by Equation 1, obtained by integrating the differential equation for second order kinetics, [ At=(A0−A∞)/[1+A0(k1/ϵGR)t]+A∞ (Eq. 1) where A0 is the absorbance at t = 0, i.e. at the earliest time point after the actinic laser flash; A∞ is the final absorbance, and ϵGR is the extinction coefficient of the G(–H)• radicals at 315 nm (7.3 × 104m–1 cm–1 (25Steenken S. Jovanovic S.V. Bietti M. Bernhard K. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2000; 122: 2373-2374Google Scholar)). The values of k1 were calculated by fitting Equation 1 to the transient absorption profiles at 315 nm. In these experiments, the initial concentration of the G(–H)• radicals was varied from 0.2 to 1 μm by increasing the laser pulse energy.Table IKinetic parameters of combination of the G(-H). and O2−⋅ radicals in DNANo.ReactionknRef.m-1 s-11aThe rate constants were measured in 5 mm phosphate buffer solutions (pH 7.5) containing 100 mm NaCl and saturated with oxygen at 1 atm; the uncertainties are given as standard errors for the best least squares fits of the appropriate kinetic equations to the transient absorption profiles of G(-H). decay recorded at 315 nm.5′-CC[2AP]TC[G(−H)·]CTACC+O2·¯→products(4.7 ± 0.8) × 108This work5′-CC[2AP]TC[G(−H)·]CTACC+O2·¯→products(4.7 ± 1.0) × 108This work3′-GG—T-AG—C—GATGG2O2·¯+O2·¯+2H+→H2O2+O25.2 × 10529Bielski B.H.J.

https://openalex.org/W1966692594,"Spores of Bacillus anthracis, the causative agent of anthrax, are enclosed by a prominent loose fitting layer called the exosporium. The exosporium consists of a basal layer and an external hairlike nap. The filaments of the nap are composed of a highly immunogenic glycoprotein called BclA, which has a long, central collagen-like region with multiple XXG repeats. Most of the triplet repeats are PTG, and nearly all of the triplet repeats contain a threonine residue, providing multiple potential sites for O-glycosylation. In this study, we demonstrated that two O-linked oligosaccharides, a 715-Da tetrasaccharide and a 324-Da disaccharide, are released from spore- and exosporium-associated BclA by hydrazinolysis. Each oligosaccharide is probably attached to BclA through a GalNAc linker, which was lost during oligosaccharide release. We found that multiple copies of the tetrasaccharide are linked to the collagen-like region of BclA, whereas the disaccharide may be attached outside of this region. Using NMR, mass spectrometry, and other analytical techniques, we determined that the structure of the tetrasaccharide is 2-O-methyl-4-(3-hydroxy-3-methylbutamido)-4,6-dideoxy-β-d-glucopyranosyl-(1→3)-α-l-rhamnopyranosyl-(1→3)-α-l-rhamnopyranosyl-(1→2)-l-rhamnopyranose. The previously undescribed nonreducing terminal sugar (i.e. 2-O-methyl-4-(3-hydroxy-3-methylbutamido)-4,6-dideoxy-d-glucose) was given the trivial name anthrose. Anthrose was not found in spores of either Bacillus cereus or Bacillus thuringiensis, two species that are the most phylogenetically similar to B. anthracis. Thus, anthrose may be useful for species-specific detection of B. anthracis spores or as a new target for therapeutic intervention.

Thus, anthrose may be useful for species-specific detection of B. anthracis spores or as a new target for therapeutic intervention. Bacillus anthracis is a Gram-positive, rod-shaped, aerobic soil bacterium that causes anthrax in humans and other mammals (1Mock M. Fouet A. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 2001; 55: 647-671Google Scholar). Like other Bacillus species, B. anthracis forms endospores (or spores) when vegetative cells are deprived of an essential nutrient (2Priest F.G. Sonenshein A.L. Hoch J.A. Losick R. Bacillus subtilis and Other Gram-positive Bacteria: Biochemistry, Physiology, and Molecular Biology. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D. C.1993: 3-16Google Scholar). The mature spore is dormant and highly resistant to extreme temperatures, radiation, harsh chemicals, desiccation, and physical damage (3Nicholson W.L. Munakata N. Horneck G. Melosh H.J. Setlow P. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2000; 64: 548-572Google Scholar). These properties allow the spore to persist in the soil for many years until encountering a signal to germinate (4Paidhungat M. Setlow P. Sonenshein A.L. Hoch J.A. Losick R. Bacillus subtilis and Its Closest Relatives: From Genes to Cells. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D. C.2002: 537-548Google Scholar). Anthrax is typically contracted by contact with spores (1Mock M. Fouet A. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 2001; 55: 647-671Google Scholar). Because of their ability to cause a potentially fatal disease and to withstand harsh conditions, spores of B. anthracis have been developed into weapons of mass destruction by numerous countries and terrorist groups (5Webb G.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 4355-4356Google Scholar). The effectiveness of B. anthracis spores as a biological weapon was demonstrated when letters laden with spores were mailed in the United States in the fall of 2001. In response to the threat of future releases of lethal spores, new research has been undertaken to enhance our knowledge of B. anthracis biology and pathogenesis. A major goal of such studies is to identify components of the B. anthracis spore that can serve either as molecular targets of spore inactivation or as unique markers that allow rapid and accurate spore detection (6Williams D.D. Benedek O. Turnbough Jr., C.L. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2003; 69: 6288-6293Google Scholar). Sporulation in the genus Bacillus begins in the starved vegetative cell with an asymmetric septation that produces large and small genome-containing compartments called the mother cell and forespore, respectively (7Errington J. Microbiol. Rev. 1993; 57: 1-33Google Scholar). The mother cell then engulfs the forespore and surrounds it with a layer of modified peptidoglycan called the cortex and a more external proteinaceous layer called the coat. The spore coat, composed of three sublayers and many different proteins, forms the outermost detectable layer for spores of many species (e.g. B. subtilis) (8Lai E.M. Phadke N.D. Kachman M.T. Giorno R. Vazquez S. Vazquez J.A. Maddock J.R. Driks A. J. Bacteriol. 2003; 185: 1443-1454Google Scholar, 9Henriques A.O. Moran Jr., C.P. Methods. 2000; 20: 95-110Google Scholar). For other Bacillus species, such as B. anthracis, the spore coat is surrounded by another prominent layer called the exosporium, which is synthesized by the mother cell concurrently with the cortex and coat (10Gerhardt P. Fed. Proc. 1967; 26: 1504-1517Google Scholar). After a final stage of maturation, during which covalent modifications occur in the outer layers of the spore, the mother cell lyses and releases the spore (9Henriques A.O. Moran Jr., C.P. Methods. 2000; 20: 95-110Google Scholar, 11Roels S. Losick R. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 6263-6275Google Scholar). Of particular interest in current studies of the B. anthracis spore is the exosporium, which is the primary permeability barrier of the spore and the source of spore surface antigens (10Gerhardt P. Fed. Proc. 1967; 26: 1504-1517Google Scholar, 12Steichen C. Chen P. Kearney J.F. Turnbough Jr., C.L. J. Bacteriol. 2003; 185: 1903-1910Google Scholar). As the outermost surface of the spore, the exosporium interacts with the soil environment, detection devices, spore-binding cells in the mammalian host, and host defenses. Thus, it is likely that the exosporium plays an important role in spore survival and/or pathogenesis (12Steichen C. Chen P. Kearney J.F. Turnbough Jr., C.L. J. Bacteriol. 2003; 185: 1903-1910Google Scholar). To demonstrate such a role, it is necessary to characterize individual exosporium components. Early studies revealed that spores of B. anthracis and closely related species (e.g. Bacillus cereus and Bacillus thuringiensis) possess an exosporium composed of a paracrystalline basal layer and an external hairlike nap, which exhibits a strain-specific length up to 600 Å (10Gerhardt P. Fed. Proc. 1967; 26: 1504-1517Google Scholar, 13Gerhardt P. Ribi E. J. Bacteriol. 1964; 88: 1774-1789Google Scholar, 14Hachisuka Y. Kojima K. Sato T. J. Bacteriol. 1966; 91: 2382-2384Google Scholar, 15Beaman T.C. Pankratz H.S. Gerhardt P. J. Bacteriol. 1971; 107: 320-324Google Scholar, 16Kramer M.J. Roth I.L. Can. J. Microbiol. 1968; 14: 1297-1299Google Scholar). The exosporium constitutes about 2% of the mass of the spore and contains approximately 50% protein, 20% lipid, 20% carbohydrate, and 10% other components (17Matz L.L. Beaman T.C. Gerhardt P. J. Bacteriol. 1970; 101: 196-201Google Scholar). A recent proteomic analysis of the exosporium suggested that it contains at least 137 different proteins (18Liu H. Bergman N.H. Thomason B. Shallom S. Hazen A. Crossno J. Rasko D.A. Ravel J. Read T.D. Peterson S.N. Yates J.I. Hanna P.C. J. Bacteriol. 2004; 186: 164-178Google Scholar). However, this analysis was performed with an exosporium fraction prepared from spores that were not purified sufficiently to remove contaminating proteins released into the growth medium by lysed cells (44Williams D.D. Turnbough Jr., C.L. J. Bacteriol. 2004; 186: 566-569Google Scholar). Analyses of the exosporium prepared from highly purified spores indicates that about 20 different protein species are present in or tightly associated with the exosporium (12Steichen C. Chen P. Kearney J.F. Turnbough Jr., C.L. J. Bacteriol. 2003; 185: 1903-1910Google Scholar, 19Todd S.J. Moir A.J.G. Johnson M.J. Moir A. J. Bacteriol. 2003; 185: 3373-3378Google Scholar, 44Williams D.D. Turnbough Jr., C.L. J. Bacteriol. 2004; 186: 566-569Google Scholar). The first B. anthracis exosporium protein identified, and one of the most interesting, was a glycoprotein called BclA (for Bacillus collagen-like protein of anthracis) (12Steichen C. Chen P. Kearney J.F. Turnbough Jr., C.L. J. Bacteriol. 2003; 185: 1903-1910Google Scholar, 20Sylvestre P. Couture-Tosi E. Mock M. Mol. Microbiol. 2002; 45: 169-178Google Scholar). BclA is the structural component of the hairlike nap and contains multiple, collagen-like Xaa-Yaa-Gly (or XXG) repeats in its central region (20Sylvestre P. Couture-Tosi E. Mock M. Mol. Microbiol. 2002; 45: 169-178Google Scholar). The number of XXG repeats in BclA varies among strains (12Steichen C. Chen P. Kearney J.F. Turnbough Jr., C.L. J. Bacteriol. 2003; 185: 1903-1910Google Scholar, 21Sylvestre P. Couture-Tosi E. Mock M. J. Bacteriol. 2003; 185: 1555-1563Google Scholar). This variation is responsible for the different lengths of the hairlike nap found on spores of different B. anthracis strains (21Sylvestre P. Couture-Tosi E. Mock M. J. Bacteriol. 2003; 185: 1555-1563Google Scholar). BclA has also been shown to be the immunodominant protein on the B. anthracis spore surface, because most antibodies raised against spores react with this protein (12Steichen C. Chen P. Kearney J.F. Turnbough Jr., C.L. J. Bacteriol. 2003; 185: 1903-1910Google Scholar). Finally, most of the XXG repeats in the collagen-like region of BclA have the sequence PTG, and nearly all of the XXG repeats contain a threonine residue, which may be a site of attachment of an O-linked oligosaccharide (22Schmidt M.A. Riley L.W. Benz I. Trends Microbiol. 2003; 11: 554-561Google Scholar, 23Jentoft N. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1990; 15: 291-294Google Scholar). In this report, we describe two O-linked oligosaccharides that are attached to BclA: a 715-Da tetrasaccharide and a 324-Da disaccharide. We show that multiple copies of the tetrasaccharide are linked to the collagen-like region of BclA, whereas the disaccharide may be attached outside of this region. The attachment of each oligosaccharide to BclA may occur through a GalNAc linker, which is lost during oligosaccharide release. Using several analytical techniques, we determine the complete structure of the tetrasaccharide. It contains a unique sugar residue that may be useful for species-specific detection of B. anthracis spores or even serve as a new target for preventing anthrax. Bacterial Strains—The Sterne veterinary vaccine strain of B. anthracis along with B. cereus T and B. thuringiensis ssp. kurstaki were obtained from John Ezzell (U.S. Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases, Fort Detrick, MD). B. subtilis (trpC2) 1A700 (originally designated 168) was obtained from the Bacillus Genetic Stock Center (Ohio State University, Columbus, OH). The Sterne strain of B. anthracis is not a human pathogen because it lacks plasmid pXO2, which carries the genes necessary to produce the protective poly-γ-d-glutamic acid capsule of the vegetative cell. Spores of the Sterne strain appear to be essentially identical to spores of virulent strains of B. anthracis (24Read T.D. Peterson S.N. Tourasse N. Baillie L.W. Paulsen I.T. Nelson K.E. Tettelin H. Fouts D.E. Eisen J.A. Gill S.R. Holtzapple E.K. Okstad O.A. Helgason E. Rilstone J. Wu M. Kolonay J.F. Beanan M.J. Dodson R.J. Brinkac L.M. Gwinn M. DeBoy R.T. Madpu R. Daugherty S.C. Durkin A.S.

Plasmid and Strain Constructions—Recombinant DNA techniques, preparation of plasmid DNA from Escherichia coli, and transformation of E. coli were carried out by standard procedures (25Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1989Google Scholar). Electroporation of B. anthracis was performed using unmethylated plasmid DNA isolated from E. coli strain GM1684 (dam-4) (26Koehler T.M. Dai Z. Kaufman-Yarbray M. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 586-595Google Scholar). Mutants of the B. anthracis Sterne strain were constructed by allelic exchange between the chromosome and a mutant locus carried by the shuttle vector pUTE29 as previously described (27Saile E. Koehler T.M. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 370-380Google Scholar, 28Dai Z.J.-C. Sirard M. Mock M. Koehler T.M. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 16: 1171-1181Google Scholar). Without selection with tetracycline, plasmid pUTE29 is not maintained in B. anthracis (26Koehler T.M. Dai Z. Kaufman-Yarbray M. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 586-595Google Scholar). Sitedirected mutagenesis was performed with the QuikChange™ kit from Stratagene. To construct a ΔbclA deletion strain, a DNA segment containing the bclA gene and about 1 kb of flanking sequence on each side was PCR-amplified using genomic B. anthracis Sterne DNA as the template. The PCR product was cloned into plasmid pCR-Blunt II-TOPO (Invitrogen), and a unique BglII restriction site (used below) was introduced 56 bp after the bclA stop codon, in an apparent intergenic region (12Steichen C. Chen P. Kearney J.F. Turnbough Jr., C.L. J. Bacteriol. 2003; 185: 1903-1910Google Scholar), by site-directed mutagenesis. The unique ApaI restriction site in this plasmid (from the TOPO vector) was also removed by site-directed mutagenesis, and the resultant plasmid was designated pCLT1159. Using this plasmid as the template, outward PCR was used to create a new plasmid in which most of the bclA gene (i.e. codons 27–382 of 400) was removed and replaced with an ApaI site. The region containing the bclA deletion and flanking B. anthracis DNA was then excised and inserted into the multiple cloning site (between PstI and KpnI) of plasmid pUTE29. A kanamycin resistance cassette from plasmid pUC18::Ωkm-2 (29Perez-Casal J. Caparon M.G. Scott J.R. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 2617-2624Google Scholar) was inserted into the unique BglII site of the plasmid. After passage through E. coli strain GM1684 (dam-4), the plasmid was electroporated into B. anthracis. The transformant was grown under conditions that allowed allelic exchange to replace the wild-type bclA locus with the ΔbclA mutation and adjacent kanamycin resistance cassette, while permitting the loss of the recombinant pUTE29 (27Saile E. Koehler T.M. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 370-380Google Scholar, 28Dai Z.J.-C. Sirard M. Mock M. Koehler T.M. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 16: 1171-1181Google Scholar). The mutant locus was confirmed by PCR amplification of the bclA region and sequencing the DNA product, and the mutant strain was designated CLT292. To construct mutant strains carrying a reduced number of XXG repeats in the bclA gene, we first performed outward PCR with primers 5′-ACTGGGCCCACTGGTGCTACCGGACTG and 5′-AGTGGGCCCAGTTGGTCCAGTAGTACC and plasmid pCLT1159 (bclA+) as the template. One primer hybridizes to a unique site, whereas the other hybridizes to multiple sites within the central region of bclA. The resulting PCR products were digested with ApaI and circularized to produce plasmids carrying a partial deletion (not all the same) of the bclA repeat region. After cloning and propagating the plasmids in E. coli, the deletions were defined by sequence analysis. For each deletion plasmid, a fragment containing the mutant bclA gene and flanking sequences was excised and inserted into plasmid pUTE29 as above. A spectinomycin-resistance cassette from plasmid pJRS312 (Ω-sp) (27Saile E. Koehler T.M. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 370-380Google Scholar) was inserted into the unique BglII site downstream of bclA. The resulting plasmid was used for allelic replacement of the bclA locus using strain CLT292 (ΔbclA kan) as the recipient. We confirmed that each mutant strain was kanamycin-sensitive and spectinomycin-resistant, and carried the expected deletion. To construct a strain unable to synthesize l-rhamnose, we generated a derivative of plasmid pUTE29 that contained a spectinomycin-resistance cassette (i.e. Ω-sp) flanked by sequences upstream and downstream of the rmlD gene of B. anthracis. This plasmid was used for allelic replacement of the rmlD locus of the Sterne strain as described above. The mutant strain, designated CLT274, contains a deletion that removes codons 11–264 of the 284 rmlD codons, and the deleted codons are replaced by the Ω-sp cassette. Preparation of Spores and Purified Exosporium—Spores were prepared from cultures grown at 37 °C for 48–72 h on liquid or solid Difco sporulation medium, extensively washed in cold (4 °C) distilled water, sedimented through 50% Renografin to remove vegetative cells and debris, and washed again in cold water (30Knurr J. Benedek O. Heslop J. Vinson R.B. Boydston J.A. McAndrew J. Kearney J.F. Turnbough Jr., C.L. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2003; 69: 6841-6847Google Scholar, 31Nicholson W.L. Setlow P. Harwood C.R. Cutting S.M. Molecular Biological Methods for Bacillus. John Wiley & Sons, Ltd., West Sussex, UK1990: 391-450Google Scholar). Spores were stored in water at 4 °C (protected from light) and quantitated microscopically using a Petroff-Hausser counting chamber. The exosporium was removed from spores by passage through a French press and then highly purified by differential centrifugation as previously described (12Steichen C. Chen P. Kearney J.F. Turnbough Jr., C.L. J. Bacteriol. 2003; 185: 1903-1910Google Scholar). Monosaccharide Analysis by Gas Chromatography—The monosaccharide compositions of spores, exosporium, and other samples were determined by gas chromatographic analysis of the trimethylsilyl derivatives of the sugar methyl glycosides. Samples were dried in a vacuum centrifuge, resuspended in 400 μl of 1.45 n methanolic HCl, and heated at 80 °C overnight. The methanolic HCl was removed by vacuum centrifugation, and the sample was resuspended in 200 μl of methanol, followed by the addition of 20 μl of acetic anhydride and 20 μl of pyridine. This mixture was allowed to react for 30 min at room temperature and then evaporated to dryness. The samples were then trimethylsilylated using 50 μl of Tri-Sil (Pierce), and the vials were sealed under argon. The trimethylsilylated glycosides were separated and quantitated on an HP 5890 gas chromatograph equipped with a 30-m HP-1 wide bore fused silica column coated with a 0.88-μm layer of cross-linked methyl silicone gum. Samples were applied to the column with an automatic injector, and sugars were detected by flame ionization. Determination of the Absolute Configuration of Rhamnose Residues—To distinguish between the d- and l-forms of rhamnose residues, the (+)-2-butyl glycosides were prepared and analyzed by gas chromatography as previously described (32Leontein K. Lindberg B. Lonngren J. Carbohydr. Res. 1978; 62: 359-362Google Scholar). However, HCl rather than trifluoroacetic acid was used as the catalyst, and rather than using acetate derivatives, as in the original procedure, trimethylsilyl derivatives were prepared as described above. The retention time of the uncommon d-rhamnose, for which a standard was not available, was determined by chromatography of the (–)-2-butyl glycoside of l-rhamnose. Hydrazinolysis of Glycoproteins—Selective hydrazinolysis was used to release O-linked oligosaccharides from spore glycoproteins. B. anthracis spores (1010) or exosporium samples were dried in a vacuum centrifuge and desiccated overnight over P2O5 under vacuum. Anhydrous hydrazine (1 ml) was added to each sample in a glass ampoule, which was flushed with argon and flame-sealed. The samples were heated at 60 °C for 5 h to specifically release O-linked oligosaccharides (33Patel T. Bruce J. Merry A. Bigge C. Wormald M. Jaques A. Parekh R. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 679-693Google Scholar). The hydrazine was evaporated under vacuum and the residue was resuspended in 3 ml of water. The mixture was centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 10 min, and the supernatant containing oligosaccharides was collected. Gel Filtration Chromatography and Assay of Rhamnose-containing Oligosaccharides—The supernatant obtained from the hydrazinolysis procedure was loaded onto a 170 × 2.2 cm Bio-Gel P4 (fine; Bio-Rad) column, and the oligosaccharides were eluted with 0.1 m acetic acid. Three-ml fractions were collected, and a 250-μl sample of each fraction was assayed for 6-deoxy sugars (e.g. rhamnose) using the Dische-Shettles protocol (34Dische Z. Shettles L.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1948; 175: 595-603Google Scholar). Mass Spectrometry—Mass spectrometry was performed with a Micromass Q-TOF 2 mass spectrometer. Samples were introduced by flow injection into a stream of 50% acetonitrile containing 0.1% formic acid delivered by a Harvard model 22 syringe pump and were ionized by the electrospray mode. NMR Spectroscopy—Approximately 750 μg of the purified tetrasaccharide was lyophilized, dissolved in 450 μl of Me2SO-d6 (99.99% deuterium), and transferred to a 5-mm NMR tube. NMR data were collected on a Bruker DRX-500 NMR spectrometer using a 5 mm TXI probe equipped with x, y, z gradients at a probe temperature of 25 °C. A few measurements were repeated at 600 MHz on an Avance DRX-600 NMR spectrometer. NMR experiments were performed on samples stored for 3–4 days at 4 °C. Standard Bruker pulse sequences were used, except for the 13C-coupled HSQC, where the program was modified to remove the 13C decoupling during acquisition. Proton and carbon chemical shifts were referenced to an internal Me2SO peak (2.490 ppm for proton and 39.5 ppm for 13C). In addition to standard 1H and 13C one-dimensional NMR spectra, a series of homo- and heteronuclear two-dimensional NMR data sets were obtained. DQF-COSY 1The abbreviations used are: DQF-COSY, double quantum filtered-correlated spectroscopy; HSQC, heteronuclear single quantum coherence; TOCSY, total correlation spectroscopy; NOE, nuclear Overhauser enhancement; NOESY, nuclear Overhauser enhancement spectroscopy; HMBC, heteronuclear multiple bond correlation; ESI-Q-TOF, electrospray ionization-quadrupole-time of flight; Ant, anthrose. was collected with 4096 data points and 0.409 s acquisition time in the F2 dimension with 800 increments in the indirect dimension. The data matrix was zero-filled in the F1 dimension to give a matrix of 4096 × 2048 points. The two-dimensional TOCSY experiments were performed with various spin lock times of 20, 40, 50, and 70 ms. The two-dimensional NOESY experiments were performed using 400- and 800-ms mixing times. The heteronuclear two-dimensional experiments HSQC, HSQC-TOCSY, and HMBC (with and without bilinear rotation decoupling filter) were performed using pulse field gradient programs. Data processing and plotting were performed using the Bruker Xwinplot program. Analysis of the Exosporium Monosaccharide Composition—As the first step in the identification of BclA oligosaccharides, we analyzed the monosaccharide composition of exosporium preparations purified from spores of wild-type and ΔbclA strains of B. anthracis (Sterne). Equal amounts of each exosporium sample were subjected to methanolysis, and trimethylsilyl derivatives of the resulting methyl glycosides were separated by gas chromatography. Methanolysis gives rise to several isomeric methyl glycosides in defined ratios for a particular sugar (35Bhatti T. Chambers R.E. Clamp J.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1970; 222: 339-347Google Scholar). The results showed that the wild-type exosporium contained at least four major monosaccharides that were absent in the ΔbclA exosporium (Fig. 1). Based on the retention times and isomeric ratios of sugar standards, we identified the most abundant monosaccharide residue as rhamnose and a second residue as GalNAc. Because bacteria are known to make both d- and l-rhamnose, we determined the absolute configuration of the rhamnose in the exosporium. The chiral 2-butyl glycosides of rhamnose were prepared, and the trimethylsilyl derivatives were analyzed by gas chromatography (32Leontein K. Lindberg B. Lonngren J. Carbohydr. Res. 1978; 62: 359-362Google Scholar). Only l-rhamnose was present (data not shown). The other two major monosaccharide residues that appear to be associated with BclA are labeled A and B in Fig. 1A. Component A is a unique monosaccharide described in detail below, and component B is most likely 3-O-methyl l-rhamnose based on a preliminary characterization (data not shown). The latter assignment is supported by the previous identification of 3-O-methyl rhamnose as a component of B. anthracis spores (36Fox A. Black G.E. Fox K. Rostovtseva S. J. Clin. Microbiol. 1993; 31: 887-894Google Scholar). The gas chromatogram of the ΔbclA exosporium contained a minor peak of a sugar with a retention time similar to that of the major methyl glycoside isomer of rhamnose (Fig. 1B). However, this sugar does not appear to be rhamnose. The same minor peak was present in a chromatogram of a ΔrmlD derivative of the Sterne strain that is unable to synthesize l-rhamnose (data not shown). Based on retention times and isomeric ratios of sugar standards, the minor sugar was tentatively identified as ribose, which was previously reported to be present in low levels in the exosporium of B. cereus T (17Matz L.L. Beaman T.C. Gerhardt P. J. Bacteriol. 1970; 101: 196-201Google Scholar) and in spores of B. anthracis (36Fox A. Black G.E. Fox K. Rostovtseva S. J. Clin. Microbiol. 1993; 31: 887-894Google Scholar). The only BclA-associated peak present in the chromatogram of the ΔrmlD strain was that of GalNAc. Although the four BclA-associated monosaccharides described above were major components of the exosporium carbohydrate, they were relatively minor components of the carbohydrate present in intact spores (data not shown). Thus, these monosaccharides appear to be components of glycoconjugates that are primarily or uniquely found in the exosporium. Isolation of Rhamnose-containing Oligosaccharides Associated with BclA—The numerous threonine residues in the collagen-like region of BclA and the monosaccharide composition of the exosporium indicated that one or more rhamnose-containing oligosaccharides were O-linked to BclA. To isolate these oligosaccharides, 1010 purified spores of the Sterne strain of B. anthracis were treated with anhydrous hydrazine under conditions that released only O-linked oligosaccharides. The free oligosaccharides were separated on a Bio-Gel P4 column (2.2 × 170 cm), and column fractions were assayed for rhamnose. Two oligosaccharide peaks were detected (Fig. 2). Based on the elution times of oligosaccharide standards, the larger peak corresponded to a tetrasaccharide, whereas the smaller peak corresponded to a disaccharide. Analysis of individual column fractions by ESI-Q-TOF mass spectrometry indicated that each oligosaccharide peak was essentially homogeneous and that the tetrasaccharide and disaccharide had masses of 715 and 324 Da, respectively. Both oligosaccharides were also isolated from purified exosporium of the Sterne strain following hydrazinolysis and gel filtration chromatography as described above. In addition, two minor peaks corresponding to a pentasaccharide and a trisaccharide were observed with masses of 918 and 527 Da, respectively (data not shown). These masses are equal to those of the tetrasaccharide and disaccharide, respectively, with the addition of a GalNAc residue. The significance of the minor oligosaccharides detected in the exosporium is discussed below. To determine whether the two major oligosaccharides were present in spores lacking BclA, we subjected 1010 spores of a ΔbclA derivative of the Sterne strain to hydrazinolysis and assayed for oligosaccharides as described above. No oligosaccharides were detected in the column fractions (Fig. 2). This result indicated that the tetrasaccharide and disaccharide found in wild-type spores were attached to or at least associated with BclA. Each purified oligosaccharide from wild-type s"

Cardiolipin is subjected to remodeling subsequent to its de novo biosynthesis to attain appropriate acyl composition for its biological functions. Yet, the enzyme(s) involved in the remodeling process have not been identified. We report here the identification and characterization of a murine gene that encodes an acyl-CoA:lysocardiolipin acyltransferase 1 (ALCAT1). Expression of the ALCAT1 cDNA in either insect or mammalian cells led to a significant increase in acyl-CoA:monolysocardiolipin acyltransferase and acyl-CoA: dilysocardiolipin acyltransferase activities that exhibited a dependence upon ALCAT1 enzyme levels. The recombinant ALCAT1 enzyme recognizes both monolysocardiolipin and dilysocardiolipin as substrates with a preference for linoleoyl-CoA and oleoyl-CoA as acyl donors. In contrast, no significant increases in acyltransferase activities by the recombinant ALCAT1 were detected against either glycerol-3-phosphate or a variety of other lysophospholipids as substrates, including lysophosphatidylcholine, lysophosphatidylethanolamine, and lysophosphatidylserine. Immunocytohistochemical analysis showed that the ALCAT1 enzyme is localized in the endoplasmic reticulum, which is supported by a significant ALCAT activity in isolated liver and heart microsomes. Northern blot analysis indicates that the mouse ALCAT1 is widely distributed, with the highest expression in heart and liver. In support of a role for ALCAT1 in maintaining heart function, the ALCAT1 gene is conserved among different species of vertebrates, but not in non-atrium organisms. ALCAT1 represents the first identified cardiolipin-remodeling enzyme from any living organism; its identification implies a novel role for the endoplasmic reticulum in cardiolipin metabolism.

ALCAT1 represents the first identified cardiolipin-remodeling enzyme from any living organism; its identification implies a novel role for the endoplasmic reticulum in cardiolipin metabolism. Cardiolipin is a major membrane polyglycerophospholipid of the mitochondria, where it serves specific roles in mitochondrial structure and functions. Cardiolipin is required for the reconstituted activity of a number of metabolic enzymes and carrier proteins (1Schlame M. Rua D. Greenberg M.L. Prog. Lipid Res. 2000; 39: 257-288Google Scholar, 2Hatch G.M. Int. J. Mol. Med. 1998; 1: 33-41Google Scholar). Cardiolipin in the inner mitochondrial membrane serves as a Ca2+-binding site, by which Ca2+ triggers mitochondrial membrane permeabilization (3Orrenius S. Zhivotovsky B. Nicotera P. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 4: 552-565Google Scholar). Cardiolipin also plays a role in maintaining the mitochondrial membrane potential, and absence of cardiolipin in yeast results in defects in protein import and other mitochondrial functions (1Schlame M. Rua D. Greenberg M.L. Prog. Lipid Res. 2000; 39: 257-288Google Scholar). Additionally, cardiolipin is required for cell survival, and disassociation of cytochrome c from cardiolipin triggers apoptosis (4Ott M. Robertson J.D. Gogvadze V. Zhivotovsky B. Orrenius S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 1259-1263Google Scholar, 5McMillin J.B. Dowhan W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1585: 97-107Google Scholar). Cardiolipin is the only known dimeric phospholipid, consisting of four fatty acyl chains, which is restricted to C18 chains dominated by the linoloeyl group (C18:2) (6Schlame M. Brody S. Hostetler K.Y. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 212: 727-735Google Scholar). The unique fatty acyl composition is believed to be important for its proper biological functions. The hydrophobic double-unsaturated linoleic diacylglycerol species seems to be required for the high affinity binding of cardiolipin to proteins (7Schlame M. Horvath L. Vigh L. Biochem. J. 1990; 265: 79-85Google Scholar). Thus, alteration in molecular species composition of cardiolipin was shown to affect the activities of cytochrome c oxidase and other electron transport chain enzymes (8Yamaoka-Koseki S. Urade R. Kito M. J. Nutr. 1991; 121: 956-958Google Scholar, 9Nomura K. Imai H. Koumura T. Kobayashi T. Nakagawa Y. Biochem. J. 2000; 351 (Pt 1): 183-193Google Scholar). However, the formation of the unique fatty acyl content of cardiolipin does not occur during de novo biosynthesis, because the enzymes of the cardiolipin biosynthetic pathway lack appropriate substrate selectivity (10Hostetler K.Y. Galesloot J.M. Boer P. Van Den Bosch H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1975; 380: 382-389Google Scholar, 11Rustow B. Schlame M. Rabe H. Reichmann G. Kunze D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 1002: 261-263Google Scholar, 12Schlame M. Rustow B. Kunze D. Rabe H. Reichmann G. Biochem. J. 1986; 240: 247-252Google Scholar). Hence, newly synthesized cardiolipin is believed to undergo a remodeling process to achieve its appropriate acyl content. Two distinct mechanisms have been proposed to carry out the remodeling process. The first involves de-acylation by phospholipase A2 to lysocardiolipin followed by reacylation of lysocardiolipin (1Schlame M. Rua D. Greenberg M.L. Prog. Lipid Res. 2000; 39: 257-288Google Scholar). An enzyme responsible for the acylation of monolysocardiolipin to cardiolipin, acyl-CoA:monolysocardiolipin acyltransferase (MLCL AT), 1The abbreviations used are: MLCL AT, acyl-CoA:monolysocardiolipin acyltransferase; ALCAT1, acyl-CoA:lysocardiolipin acyltransferase 1; DLCL AT, acyl-CoA:dilysocardiolipin acyltransferase; Sf9, Spodoptera frugiperda 9; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; TLC, thin layer chromatography; GPAT, glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase; MLCL, monolysocardiolipin; PA, phosphatidic acid; PI, phosphatidylinositol. has been characterized in the rat liver and heart, and was recently purified from pig liver mitochondria fraction (13Schlame M. Rustow B. Biochem. J. 1990; 272: 589-595Google Scholar, 14Ma B.J. Taylor W.A. Dolinsky V.W. Hatch G.M. J. Lipid Res. 1999; 40: 1837-1845Google Scholar, 15Taylor W.A. Hatch G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 12716-12721Google Scholar). The alternative mechanism proposed for cardiolipin remodeling involves transacylation of acyl groups from phosphatidylcholine or phosphatidylethanolamine using both cardiolipin and monolysocardiolipin as substrates (16Xu Y. Kelley R.I. Blanck T.J.J. Schlame M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 51380-51385Google Scholar). Thus far, cumulative information of the remodeling process is not conclusive due to the lack of a cloned gene that encodes the enzyme(s). In the present study, we report the identification and characterization of a murine gene encoding an acyl-CoA:lysocardiolipin acyltransferase 1 (ALCAT1) that possesses both MLCL AT and acyl-CoA:dilysocardiolipin acyltransferase (DLCL AT) activities. The recombinant ALCAT1 expressed in both Spodoptera frugiperda 9 (Sf9) insect cells and mammalian cells demonstrated predominant activity and selectivity toward linoleoyl-CoA and oleoyl-CoA. Consistent with a major role of cardiolipin in heart function, the gene is expressed most abundantly in heart and liver. In comparison to the two known mechanisms involved in cardiolipin remodeling in the mitochondria, subcellular localization studies indicate that ALCAT1 is localized in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), thus revealing a novel role of ER in cardiolipin remodeling. Cloning of Full-length Lysocardiolipin Acyltransferase cDNA—The full-length mouse ALCAT1 cDNA was cloned by PCR amplification using for forward primer 5′CAGTGTCCCCGCGACGTCGCGCGT3′ and for reverse primer 5′CAAAGACTGACATTCCCCGTGACA3′, designed from two mouse expressed sequence tag (EST) sequences (GenBank™ accession numbers BY718809 and BI558124) and Marathon-Ready cDNA prepared from 7-day mouse embryo (BD Biosciences Clontech, Palo Alto, CA). Amplification was performed by PCR for 35× at 94 °C for 30 s, 62 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C 2 min 10 s, resulting in a 1.3-kb cDNA product. The PCR product was cloned into the pPCR-script Amp SK(+) vector (Strategene) and sequenced. Similarly, a human GPAT1 cDNA that contained the full-length coding sequence was amplified from a human liver cDNA library (BD Biosciences Clontech) by PCR and was cloned into the pPCR-script Amp SK(+) vector. Expression of GPAT1 and ALCAT1 in Insect Cells—The expression of GPAT1 and ALCAT1 in insect cells was performed by using a Bac-to-Bac baculovirus expression system (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instruction. The ALCAT1 cDNA inserts were subcloned from pPCR-Amp SK(+) vector into the EcoRI and NotI sites of pFast-Bac-1 vector to generate recombinant baculoviral clones. High-titer recombinant baculovirus was generated by several rounds of amplification. Cells were typically infected with virus for 3 days, harvested in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and homogenized in 20 mm NaCl with 10 up-and-down strokes in a motor-driven dounce homogenizer (Heidolph, Germany), followed by 10 passages through a 27-gaugle needle. Cell homogenates were immediately subjected to enzyme assays or frozen at -80 °C for later use. Expression of mLCAT in Mammalian Cells—The FLAG epitope (DYKDDDDK) was attached to the N terminus of ALCAT1 by PCR amplification using a forward primer that carried the FLAG sequence fused in-frame with the start codon of the ALCAT1 coding region. An FLAG-tagged ALCAT1 expression vector was generated by subcloning the fusion gene into the NotI and EcoRV sites of pcDNA3.1(+)/Hygro mammalian expression vector (Invitrogen). Transient expression of ALCAT1 in COS-7 cells was carried out with Fugene 6 (Roche Diagnostics). Expression of FLAG-tagged ALCAT1 (in 20 μg of membrane protein) was measured by Western blot analysis using an anti-FLAG antibody. Subcellular localization of FLAG-tagged ALCAT1 in COS-7 cells was carried by immunocytohistochemistry using a protocol as described previously (17Cao J. Hawkins E. Brozinick J. Liu X. Zhang H. Burn P. Shi Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 18878-18886Google Scholar). In Vitro Acyltransferase Assays—GPAT activity was determined by measuring the conversion of glycerol 3-phosphate to radiolabeled 1-acyl-sn-glycerol-3-phosphate in the presence of [14C]palmitoyl-CoA as described previously (18Yet S.F. Moon Y.K. Sul H.S. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 7303-7310Google Scholar, 19Haldar D. Vancura A. Methods Enzymol. 1992; 209: 64-72Google Scholar). MLCL AT, DLCL AT, or other lysophospholipid acyltransferase was determined by measuring the incorporation of radiolabeled acyl moieties of acyl-CoAs (acyl donors) into phospholipids in the presence of MLCL, DLCL, lysophosphatidic acid (LPA), lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC), lysophosphatidylethanolamine (LPE), and lysophosphatidylserine (LPS) (14Ma B.J. Taylor W.A. Dolinsky V.W. Hatch G.M. J. Lipid Res. 1999; 40: 1837-1845Google Scholar, 15Taylor W.A. Hatch G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 12716-12721Google Scholar). The reaction mixture contained 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.0, 200 μm lysophospholipids, 25 μm [14C]acyl-CoA (50 mCi/mmol, American Radiolabeled Chemicals, Inc), and enzyme preparations (100–200 μg) in a total volume of 200 μl. The reaction was incubated at room temperature for 15–30 min. The lipids were extracted using a method as described previously (14Ma B.J. Taylor W.A. Dolinsky V.W. Hatch G.M. J. Lipid Res. 1999; 40: 1837-1845Google Scholar, 15Taylor W.A. Hatch G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 12716-12721Google Scholar). The extracted lipids were dried, separated by thin layer chromatography (TLC) with chloroform:hexane:methanol:acetic acid (50:30:10:5, v/v) or chloroform:methanol:water (65:25:4, v/v). In some experiments, separation of cardiolipin or monolysocardiolipin from other lipids was confirmed by two-dimensional TLC analysis as described (16Xu Y. Kelley R.I. Blanck T.J.J. Schlame M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 51380-51385Google Scholar). After separation, TLC plates were exposed to a PhosphorImager screen to visualize the radiolabeled products with a Molecular Dynamics STORM 860 Scanner (Sunnyvale, CA). The enzymatic products were identified with authentic standards by exposure to I2 vapor. Quantification of radiolabeled cardiolipin and monolysocardiolipin in TLC plates was carried out by scraping into scintillation vials followed by scintillation counting with a Beckman LS 6500 Scintillation System (Fullerton, CA). The specific activity of the enzyme was calculated on the basis of pmol or nmol of lipids product formed per minute of incubation time per mg of protein (pmol or nmol/mg protein/min). All quantitative data were expressed as mean ± S.E. Statistical analyses for differences between two groups were carried out using a Student's t test. Northern Blot Analysis—To analyze the tissue distribution pattern of mouse ALCAT1 mRNA, multiple tissue poly(A)+ RNA Northern blots from OriGene Technologies, Inc. (Rockville, MD) were hybridized with [α-32P]dCTP-labeled probes prepared from full-length cDNA of the mouse ALCAT1 gene. Labeling, hybridization, and blot analysis were carried out essentially as described (17Cao J. Hawkins E. Brozinick J. Liu X. Zhang H. Burn P. Shi Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 18878-18886Google Scholar), with β-actin cDNA as an internal control. Identification and Cloning of the Mouse ALCAT1 Gene—The mouse ALCAT1 gene was identified based upon sequence homology with a predicted rat acyltransferase gene (GenBank™ accession no. XM_233853) that carries the consensus sequence for glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase (GPAT) (20Lewin T.M. Wang P. Coleman R.A. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 5764-5771Google Scholar). A 1.3-kb cDNA clone encoding the full-length mouse ALCAT1 enzyme was cloned by PCR amplification using primers designed from two mouse EST sequences (BY718809 and BI558124) that match the rat gene and a cDNA library from 7-day-old mouse embryo as template. The open reading frame of the mouse ALCAT1 gene predicts a 376-amino acid protein of 44.4 kDa that carries features for a transmembrane protein and motifs conserved among members of the GPAT family (Fig. 1). BLAST analysis with genomic and EST databases identified multiple ALCAT1 orthologs from human to fish, but not in any non-atrium animal such as Caenorhabditis elegans. Tissue Distribution of Mouse ALCAT1 mRNA—The tissue distribution of mouse ALCAT1 mRNA was analyzed by Northern blot analysis. A 4.3-kb ALCAT1 mRNA transcript was detected in most tissues examined, including brain, heart, kidney, liver, lung, skin, small intestine, spleen, testis, and thymus (Fig. 2A). When normalized with the mRNA level of β-actin (Fig. 2B), the expression level was the highest in heart and liver, followed by kidney, small intestine, skin, brain, lung, thymus, spleen, and testis (Fig. 1C). A shorter isoform of ALCAT1 transcript was found only in heart, possibly suggesting a unique role of the gene in the organ. In contrast, no observable levels of expression were detected in murine muscle and stomach (Fig. 2A). Functional Analysis of ALCAT1 Expressed in Insect Cells— Recombinant ALCAT1 protein was expressed in Sf9 insect cells for functional characterization of the enzyme. A GPAT enzymatic assay was initially undertaken to determine whether the polypeptide encoded by ALCAT1 cDNA possesses GPAT activity, because the predicted ALCAT1 protein carries motifs that match all four conserved domains among members of the GPAT family (20Lewin T.M. Wang P. Coleman R.A. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 5764-5771Google Scholar). In contrast to an 8-fold increase of GPAT activity observed from the recombinant GPAT1 expressed in Sf9 cells, no significant increase in GPAT activity was detected from recombinant ALCAT1 protein expressed in Sf9 cells relative to that from Sf9 cells infected with the wild-type baculoviruses as negative control (Fig. 3A). Because the enzyme is most abundantly expressed in the heart, we next investigated whether the ALCAT1 enzyme possesses MLCL AT activity using oleoyl-CoA and monolysocardiolipin (MLCL) as substrates. As a result, a 9-fold increase in MLCL AT activity was observed from recombinant ALCAT1 enzyme expressed in Sf-9 cells relative to that from cells infected with the wild-type baculovirus or recombinant baculovirus expressing the GPAT1 cDNA, as assessed by a representative TLC analysis (Fig. 3B, lane 7 versus lanes 5 and 6). When expressed as absolute units (pmol/mg protein/min), the MLCL AT activity of ALCAT1 expressed in Sf-9 cells (237 ± 20, n = 4) was also significantly higher than that from Sf-9 cells infected with wild-type baculovirus (42 ± 4, n = 4) or recombinant baculovirus that expresses GPAT1 (33 ± 4, n = 4) (Fig. 3D, left, p < 0.01). The MLCL AT activity of the ALCAT1 enzyme is MLCL-dependent, because no labeled cardiolipin was detected in the absence of exogenous MLCL (Fig. 3B, lane 4 versus lane 7). In addition to MLCL, the mouse ALCAT1 also recognized DLCL as its substrate, as demonstrated by a >3.2-fold increase in radiolabeled monolysocardiolipin catalyzed by recombinant ALCAT1 expressed in Sf9 cells as compared with the controls (Fig. 3C, lane 3 versus lanes 1 and 2). When expressed in absolute units (pmol MLCL/mg of protein/min), the DLCL AT activity (Fig. 3D, right) of ALCAT1 expressed in Sf-9 cells (550 ± 26, n = 4) was more than 3-fold higher than the controls (138 ± 22 and 128 ± 21, respectively; n = 4, p < 0.01). The enzyme products were authenticated by a two-dimensional TLC analysis, and the results confirmed that cardiolipin (CL) and MLCL were the only products migrating at the positions of CL and MLCL on one-dimensional TLC, respectively (Fig. 3E). In contrast, no significant increases in acyltransferase activities were detected against a variety of other lysophospholipids as acyl receptors, including LPC, LPE, and LPS (Fig. 3F), although a slight increase in radiolabeled phosphatidic acid (PA) was observed in the presence of LPA and [C14]oleoyl-CoA (Fig. 3F) when compared with the controls. The recombinant ALCAT1 activity was heat-labile (Fig. 3G, lane 4 versus lane 2) and demonstrated a CoA-dependence (Fig. 3G), because no radiolabeled cardiolipin was detected when [14C]oleoyl-CoA was replaced by [14C]oleic acid as substrate (Fig. 3G, last two lanes). Analysis of the Preference of ALCAT1 toward Different Fatty Acyl-CoAs—A variety of acyl-CoA derivatives, including n-octanoyl-CoA (C8:0), lauroyl-CoA (C12:0), palmitoyl-CoA (C16:0), stearoyl-CoA (C18:0), oleoyl-CoA (18:1), linoleoyl-CoA (18:2), and arachidoyl-CoA (C20:4) were used to determine the preference of ALCAT1 activities toward different fatty acyl-CoAs using either MLCL (Fig. 4A) or DLCL (Fig. 4B) as acyl acceptor. The data were derived from three independent experiments and were expressed as mean ± S.E. As shown in Fig. 4, although homogenate from ALCAT1-expressing Sf9 cells catalyzed reacylation of lysocardiolipin with saturated acyl-CoAs of different chain lengths (C16:0 and C18:0), a significant portion of the activity was contributed by endogenous enzymes present in the Sf9 cells, as evidenced by a similar level of ALCAT activities in Sf9 cells infected with the wild-type baculovirus (Fig. 4). In contrast, when either oleoyl-CoA or linoleoyl-CoA was used as acyl donor, a 5- to 10-fold increase in ALCAT activity was observed from Sf9 cells infected with the ALCAT1-expressing baculovirus relative to that from the wild-type control, suggesting a strong preference of the recombinant ALCAT1 enzyme for the two unsaturated C18 acyl donors (Fig. 4). In addition, the recombinant ALCAT1 enzyme also exhibited high catalytic activity toward lauroyl-CoA (C12:0) when either MLCL or DLCL was used as the acyl acceptor. Expression of ALCAT1 in Mammalian Cells—To investigate the expression and activity of recombinant ALCAT1 in mammalian cells, and to correlate ALCAT1 activity with the level of expressed ALCAT1 protein, a FLAG-tagged version of ALCAT1 cDNA was expressed in COS-7 cells to measure the level of ALCAT1 protein (Western blot using anti-FLAG antibody) and ALCAT activities (DLCL AT) using oleoyl-CoA as acyl donor at different time points after transfection. The FLAG-tagged version of ALCAT1 migrated on SDS-PAGE with an apparent molecular mass of ∼44 kDa (Fig. 5A), which is consistent with the molecular mass of 44.4 kDa predicted from the open reading frame of the mouse ALCAT1 gene. The levels of ALCAT1 protein expression reached a peak at 48 h (Fig. 5A), which correlated well with the profile of ALCAT1 activities (Fig. 5B), further confirming the specificity of the enzyme. Subcellular Localization of ALCAT1—To define the subcellular localization of ALCAT1, we next performed an immunocytohistology study of the FLAG-tagged ALCAT1 in COS-7 cells. Forty-eight hours after transfection, cells were processed for mitochondrial staining with MitoTracker Red CMXRos or indirect immunofluorescence staining with antibodies specific for the FLAG peptide and calnexin, a resident ER transmembrane protein serving as an ER marker (21Le Stunff H. Galve-Roperh I. Peterson C. Milstien S. Spiegel S. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 158: 1039-1049Google Scholar). Cells were also counterstained with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) to visualize nuclei (blue). FLAG-ALCAT1 expressed in COS-7 cells displayed a perinuclear and punctated pattern (Fig. 6, A and D) that did not co-localize with MitoTracker Red CMXRos-stained mitochondria (Fig. 6B), as demonstrated in Fig. 6C by the well separated green (FLAG-ALCAT1) and red (mitochondria) colors in the merged image. In contrast, FLAG-tagged ALCAT1 protein co-localized well with the ER marker, calnexin (Fig. 6E), as evidenced in Fig. 6F by the yellow color in the merged image. The results are consistent with the KKXX motif, an ER retention signal, at the C-terminal end of the ALCAT1 peptide predictive for ER localization. Comparative Analyses of ALCAT Activities Associated with Isolated Microsomes and Mitochondria Fractions from the Mouse Liver and Heart—The finding that ALCAT1 was localized to ER encouraged us to examine further the mitochondrial and microsomal ALCAT activities in mouse tissues. The subcellular fractions were prepared as described (24Eichberg J. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 3423-3429Google Scholar). By using oleoyl-CoA or linoleoyl-CoA as acyl donors, the MLCL AT and DLCL AT activities in mouse liver and heart mitochondria and microsomes were determined, respectively. As shown in Fig. 7 by a representative TLC image (left side of each panel) and averages from three different preparations of subcellular fractions (right side, bar graph), the isolated microsomes from both liver and heart demonstrated high levels of ALCAT activities, as evidenced by efficient incorporation of the radiolabeled oleoyl or linoleoyl moiety into cardiolipin (Fig. 7A) and monolysocardiolipin (Fig. 7B), respectively. Similarly, ALCAT activities were also detected from the isolated mitochondria from rat liver and heart, but at significantly lower levels. The ALCAT activity of the liver mitochondria was less than 50% of that from the microsomes with either oleoyl-CoA or linoleoyl-CoA as acyl donor, whereas heart mitochondria activity was ∼30–40% of that from the heart microsomes (Fig. 7, A and B), suggesting a more active role of ER in cardiolipin remodeling. Furthermore, the ALCAT activities associated with liver microsomes demonstrated a different substrate specificity profile from that of mitochondria, as assessed by DLCL AT activity (Fig. 7C). The ALCAT activities associated with mitochondria displayed the highest activity toward stearoyl-CoA (C18:0) (Fig. 7C, left), whereas the ALCAT activities associated with the microsomal fraction preferred oleoyl- and palmitoyl-CoAs as acyl donors (Fig. 7C, right). The relative purity of the enriched microsomal and mitochondria fractions used in the ALCAT activity analysis was verified by Western analysis using protein markers specific for mitochondria (prohibitin) and microsome (calnexin). When compared with that from the microsome fraction, very low levels (6.6%) of calnexin were detected in the mitochondria fractions from both liver and heart (Fig. 7D, top blot, lanes 1 and 3 versus lanes 2 and 4, respectively). The levels of prohibitin in microsome fractions were only 20–30% of that detected in mitochondria fractions (Fig. 7D, bottom blot, lanes 2 and 4 versus lanes 1 and 3, respectively). Therefore, the microsomal ALCAT activities caused by the cross-contamination of mitochondria are very limited. It is well documented that fatty acid remodeling of phospholipids occurs after de novo synthesis in mammalian tissues to achieve appropriate fatty acyl composition (22Yamashita A. Sugiura T. Waku K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1997; 122: 1-16Google Scholar, 23Lands W.E. Hart P. J. Biol. Chem. 1965; 240: 1905-1911Google Scholar). Although an ALCAT enzyme activity was reported from rat liver microsomes more than three decades ago (24Eichberg J. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 3423-3429Google Scholar), a gene encoding the enzyme has not been identified. In this study, we identified a gene encoding an enzyme that possesses both MLCL AT and DLCL AT activities, designated here as ALCAT1. Evidence that the ALCAT1 gene encodes a lysocardiolipin acyltransferase is provided by the following findings. First, expression of ALCAT1 cDNA in Sf9 cells resulted in 5- to 10-fold increases in radiolabeled cardiolipin product, which depended on the presence of acyl-CoA and monolysocardiolipin or dilysocardiolipin. Absence of the acyl donors or substitution of acyl-CoA with free fatty acid resulted in loss of the activities. Second, the ALCAT activity demonstrated a dose dependence upon levels of ALCAT1 protein expression. Third, the acyltransferase activity displayed a specificity for lysocardiolipin, because no significant increases in acyltransferase activities were observed when tested against either glycerol 3-phosphate or a variety of lysophospholipids including LPC, LPE, and LPS. Finally, the recombinant ALCAT1 demonstrated a preference to linoleoyl-CoA and oleoyl-CoA as acyl donors, which is consistent with the unique fatty acid pattern of C18 found in mammalian cardiolipin (6Schlame M. Brody S. Hostetler K.Y. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 212: 727-735Google Scholar, 25Hoch F.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1113: 71-133Google Scholar). Previously, two enzymatic mechanisms have been proposed to explain the cardiolipin-remodeling process in mitochondria. The first mechanism proposes that cardiolipin remodeling begins with hydrolysis by phospholipase A2 or other as yet unidentified phospholipases that act upon lysocardiolipin and is completed with reacylation of lysocardiolipin by an acyl-CoA-dependent acyltransferase. An enzyme activity responsible for the acylation of lysocardiolipin to cardiolipin, either MLCL AT or DLCL AT, has been characterized in the rat liver and heart (14Ma B.J. Taylor W.A. Dolinsky V.W. Hatch G.M. J. Lipid Res. 1999; 40: 1837-1845Google Scholar, 24Eichberg J. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 3423-3429Google Scholar). Although a 74-kDa protein with MLCL AT activity was recently purified with more than 1000-fold enrichment from pig liver mitochondrial fraction (15Taylor W.A. Hatch G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 12716-12721Google Scholar), the purified MLCL AT failed to demonstrate the much-anticipated specificity for linoleoyl-CoA (15Taylor W.A. Hatch G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 12716-12721Google Scholar). The second mechanism proposed for a cardiolipin-remodeling process involves transacylation of acyl groups from phospholipids such as phosphatidylcholine or phosphatidylethanolamine to cardiolipin (13Schlame M. Rustow B. Biochem. J. 1990; 272: 589-595Google Scholar, 16Xu Y. Kelley R.I. Blanck T.J.J. Schlame M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 51380-51385Google Scholar). In contrast to an acyltransferase reaction that catalyzes acylation of lysocardiolipin, the transacylation reaction uses both cardiolipin and lysocardiolipin as substrates, and displays a clear preference for the linoleoyl group as an acyl donor. However, the transacylation reaction demonstrates a much lower efficiency than that from the acyl-CoA-dependent acyltransferase reaction (1 pmol/min/mg versus 200 pmol/min/mg) (13Schlame M. Rustow B. Biochem. J. 1990; 272: 589-595Google Scholar, 16Xu Y. Kelley R.I. Blanck T.J.J. Schlame M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 51380-51385Google Scholar). In addition, the phospholipid-dependent transacylation enzyme(s) does not recognize dilysocardiolipin as substrate, which is a major product from cardiolipin hydrolysis (16Xu Y. Kelley R.I. Blanck T.J.J. Schlame M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 51380-51385Google Scholar). Intriguingly, although both remodeling processes are shown to take place in isolated mitochondria, only trace amounts of lysocardiolipin were identified in the organelle (26Rouser G. Fkeischer S. Yamamoto A. Lipids. 1970; 5: 494-496Google Scholar, 27Hof H. Simon R.G. Lipids. 1970; 5: 485-487Google Scholar). Furthermore, the MLCL AT activity in heart mitochondria is the lowest among all the tissues examined (14Ma B.J. Taylor W.A. Dolinsky V.W. Hatch G.M. J. Lipid Res. 1999; 40: 1837-1845Google Scholar), despite an important role for cardiolipin remodeling in maintaining heart function (28Mutter T. Dolinsky V.W. Ma B.J. Taylor W.A. Hatch G.M. Biochem. J. 2000; 346 (Pt 2): 403-406Google Scholar). In contrast to the two proposed mitochondrial mechanisms involved in cardiolipin remodeling, the murine ALCAT1 enzyme reported in this study is an ER-associated protein, as evidenced by immunocytohistochemical analysis, thus representing a novel cardiolipin-remodeling pathway. Consistent with a role for the ALCAT1 enzyme in cardiolipin remodeling in ER, ALCAT activity was detected toward both MLCL and DLCL in microsomes isolated from liver and heart. It is unlikely that the microsomal ALCAT activity was caused by mitochondrial contamination, because significantly higher ALCAT activity was detected in the microsomes compared with that in mitochondria. This is also confirmed by Western blot analysis using antibodies that recognize protein markers specific for each organelle, showing that cross-contamination is minimal. Our data on the ALCAT1 enzyme as well as on ALCAT activity associated with isolated microsomes are further supported by a previous report (24Eichberg J. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 3423-3429Google Scholar), which demonstrated significantly higher ALCAT activities in isolated liver microsomes than those in mitochondria. Consistent with our current findings, the previously reported ALCAT activities associated with the isolated liver microsomes also lacked exclusivity to linoleoyl-CoA as the acyl donor and recognized both MLCL and DLCL as substrates (24Eichberg J. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 3423-3429Google Scholar). The physiological significance of the cloned ALCAT1 enzyme involved in cardiolipin remodeling in the ER remains elusive, because the organelle only contains ∼1% cardiolipin (29Berger A. German J.B. Gershwin M.E. Adv. Food Nutr. Res. 1993; 37: 259-338Google Scholar). Cardiolipin is localized predominantly, if not exclusively, in mitochondria that contain all of the enzymes necessary for cardiolipin biosynthesis. However, it cannot be ruled out that ER, the major subcellular organelle for lipid biosynthesis, also contributes to the cardiolipin synthesis and remodeling in vivo. In support of this scenario is the finding that phosphatidylglycerol, an important and direct precursor for cardiolipin synthesis, is synthesized in both ER and mitochondria (30Hallman M. Gluck L. Pediatr. Res. 1980; 14: 1250-1259Google Scholar, 31Harding P.G. Chan F. Casola P.G. Fellows G.F. Wong T. Possmayer F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1983; 750: 373-382Google Scholar, 32Mavis R.D. Vang M.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1981; 664: 409-415Google Scholar). In mammals, ER serves as a major intracellular source of synthesis for most phospholipids, including phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylinositol (PI), sphingomyelin, phosphatidylserine, and phosphatidylethanolamine (5McMillin J.B. Dowhan W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1585: 97-107Google Scholar, 33Vance J.E. Biochemistry of Lipids and Membranes. Pearson Benjamin Cummings, Menlo Park, CA1985Google Scholar, 34Voelker D.R. Experientia. 1990; 46: 569-579Google Scholar, 35Dowhan W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 199-232Google Scholar), and these phospholipids must be translocated to the mitochondria for their functioning (36McMurray W.C. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1986; 64: 1115-1124Google Scholar, 37Daum G. Vance J.E. Prog. Lipid Res. 1997; 36: 103-130Google Scholar). Although little is known about cardiolipin trafficking thus far, exogenous phosphatidylglycerol was reported to be used directly for cardiolipin synthesis (38Cao S.G. Hatch G.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1256: 97-102Google Scholar). Thus, the identification and molecular cloning of enzymes involved in cardiolipin biosynthesis in mammals will help in answering these questions. Cardiolipin is a predominant glycerophospholipid found in the mitochondria of heart (1Schlame M. Rua D. Greenberg M.L. Prog. Lipid Res. 2000; 39: 257-288Google Scholar, 29Berger A. German J.B. Gershwin M.E. Adv. Food Nutr. Res. 1993; 37: 259-338Google Scholar), and cardiolipin remodeling is believed to play an important role in maintaining normal heart function (39Taylor W.A. Xu F.Y. Ma B.J. Mutter T.C. Dolinsky V.W. Hatch G.M. BMC Biochem. 2002; 3: 9Google Scholar). Hence, decreased cardiolipin levels are associated with heart diseases caused by hyperthyroidism and aging, and development of anticardiolipin antibody is associated with the onset of thrombocytopenia and recurrent thrombosis (1Schlame M. Rua D. Greenberg M.L. Prog. Lipid Res. 2000; 39: 257-288Google Scholar). Additionally, defective cardiolipin remodeling is part of the pathophysiological events associated with Barth syndrome, a familial disease caused by mutations of a gene encoding a putative phospholipid acyltransferase, and is manifested by cardiomyopathy, skeletal myopathy, and other abnormalities (40Valianpour F. Wanders R.J. Overmars H. Vreken P. van Gennip A.H. Baas F. Plecko B. Santer R. Becker K. Barth P.G. J. Pediatr. 2002; 141: 729-733Google Scholar, 41Schlame M. Kelley R.I. Feigenbaum A. Towbin J.A. Heerdt P.M. Schieble T. Wanders R.J.A. DiMauro S. Blanck T.J.J. J. Am. Coll. Cardiol. 1994; 42: 1994-1999Google Scholar). In support of a role for ALCAT1 in maintaining heart function, the ALCAT1 gene is most abundantly expressed in heart. In addition, a unique mRNA splice variant is only present in the heart, although its identity and functional significance remains to be investigated in future studies. More interestingly, the gene is conserved among different mammalian species from fish to humans, but is absent in non-atrium species, such as C. elegans. Thus, the cloning and characterization of the mouse ALCAT1 gene has laid a foundation for future studies on the regulatory role of cardiolipin remodeling in maintaining heart function.

https://openalex.org/W1995016025,"Post-translational cleavage at the G protein-coupled receptor proteolytic site (GPS) has been demonstrated in many class B2 G protein-coupled receptors as well as other cell surface proteins such as polycystin-1. However, the mechanism of the GPS proteolysis has never been elucidated. Here we have characterized the cleavage of the human EMR2 receptor and identified the molecular mechanism of the proteolytic process at the GPS. Proteolysis at the highly conserved His-Leu↓Ser518 cleavage site can occur inside the endoplasmic reticulum compartment, resulting in two protein subunits that associate noncovalently as a heterodimer. Site-directed mutagenesis of the P+1 cleavage site (Ser518) shows an absolute requirement of a Ser, Thr, or Cys residue for efficient proteolysis. Substitution of the P-2 His residue to other amino acids produces slow processing precursor proteins, which spontaneously hydrolyze in a defined cell-free system. Further biochemical characterization indicates that the GPS proteolysis is mediated by an autocatalytic intramolecular reaction similar to that employed by the N-terminal nucleophile hydrolases, which are known to activate themselves by self-catalyzed cis-proteolysis. We propose here that the autoproteolytic cleavage of EMR2 represents a paradigm for the other GPS motif-containing proteins and suggest that these GPS proteins belong to a cell surface receptor subfamily of N-terminal nucleophile hydrolases.

Site-specific limited proteolysis plays an important role in a diverse range of biological processes such as the blood coagulation cascade (1Krem M.M. Cera E.D. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2002; 27: 67-74Google Scholar), determination of cell fate (2Selkoe D. Kopan R. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2003; 26: 565-597Google Scholar), ligand-induced receptor activation (3Coughlin S.R. Nature. 2000; 407: 258-264Google Scholar), release of cell-associated growth factors (4Hooper J.D. Clements J.A. Quigley J.P. Antalis T.M. J. Biol.

Cell. 1997; 91: 443-446Google Scholar). These activities are usually carried out by specific proteolytic enzymes, some of which are themselves activated by limited proteolysis (7Anderson E.D. Molloy S.S. Jean F. Fei H. Shimamura S. Thomas G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 12879-12890Google Scholar). A detailed understanding of the proteolytic mechanisms is not only critical for the functional studies of these biological processes but may also provide means for possible intervention and regulation. Of the various modes of proteolytic reactions, self-catalyzed proteolysis, or autoproteolysis, has been recognized as an essential step in the proper folding, trafficking, and activation of several endoproteases such as furin (7Anderson E.D. Molloy S.S. Jean F. Fei H. Shimamura S. Thomas G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 12879-12890Google Scholar, 8Anderson E.D. VanSlyke J.K. Thulin C.D. Jean F. Thomas G.

Autoproteolysis is also involved in the activation of a novel group of hydrolytic enzymes, the N-terminal nucleophile hydrolases (Ntn-hydrolases) 1The abbreviations used are: Ntn-hydrolase, N-terminal nucleophile hydrolase; Ntn, N-terminal nucleophile; EGF, epidermal growth factor; EGFP, enhanced green fluorescence protein; EMR2, the epidermal growth factor module-containing mucin-like receptor 2; GPCR, G-protein-coupled receptor; GPS, GPCR proteolytic site; HA, hydoxylamine; LNB-TM7, long N-terminal family B GPCR-related 7TM receptor; Ab, antibody; mAb, monoclonal antibody; REJ, receptor for egg jelly; TM7, seven-transmembrane; WT, wild type; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; CM, conditioned medium; CL, cell lysate; GPS-receptor, GPS motif-containing receptor; GFP, green fluorescent protein. 1The abbreviations used are: Ntn-hydrolase, N-terminal nucleophile hydrolase; Ntn, N-terminal nucleophile; EGF, epidermal growth factor; EGFP, enhanced green fluorescence protein; EMR2, the epidermal growth factor module-containing mucin-like receptor 2; GPCR, G-protein-coupled receptor; GPS, GPCR proteolytic site; HA, hydoxylamine; LNB-TM7, long N-terminal family B GPCR-related 7TM receptor; Ab, antibody; mAb, monoclonal antibody; REJ, receptor for egg jelly; TM7, seven-transmembrane; WT, wild type; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; CM, conditioned medium; CL, cell lysate; GPS-receptor, GPS motif-containing receptor; GFP, green fluorescent protein.

The Ntn-hydrolases are activated from an inactive proenzyme by self-mediated hydrolysis of an internal peptide bond via an N → O or N → S acyl shift between a specific nucleophilic residue and its preceding amino acid (12Perler F.B.

The newly generated N-terminal nucleophile then acts as a single enzymatic active site to attack its specific protein substrates. One unique feature of the Ntn-hydrolases is that a single nucleophilic residue is used as the reactive nucleophile for both the autoproteolytic and enzymatic activity (14Oinonen C. Tikkanen R.

In recent years, a proteolytic motif known as the G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) proteolytic site (GPS) (31) has been identified in over 40 cell surface receptors (see, on the World Wide Web, smart.embl-heidelberg.de/). As suggested in its denotation, the GPS motif is primarily found in members of the class B2 GPCRs (32Harmar A.J. Genome Biol. 2001; 2: 3013Google Scholar) or the LNB-TM7 receptors (33Stacey M.

Leukocyte Biol. 1998; 63: 271-280Google Scholar). However, the GPS motif is not exclusively restricted to the TM7 proteins. Receptors with one- or 11-pass TM configurations such as suREJ1 (39Moy G.W. Mendoza L.M. Schulz J.R. Swanson W.J. Glabe C.G. Vacquier V.D. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 809-817Google Scholar), suREJ3 (40Mengerink K.J. Moy G.W. Vacquier V.D. J. Biol.

Biol. 1999; 9: 585-588Google Scholar) also contain the consensus GPS motif, which is characterized by a Cys-rich segment of approximate 50 amino acids located proximal to the first TM domain. Proteolytic cleavage at the GPS motif generates an extracellular (α) and a TM (β) subunit that associate noncovalently on the cell surface as a heterodimer. This has led to a notion that these adhesion GPCRs might couple extracellular adhesion events to intracellular signaling via the α- and β-subunits, respectively (43Stacey M. Chang G.W. Sanos S.L. Chittenden L.R. Stubbs L. Gordon S. Lin H.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 29283-29293Google Scholar, 44Stacey M. Chang G.W. Davies J.Q. Kwakkenbos M.J. Sanderson R.D. Hamann J. Gordon S. Lin H.H. Blood. 2003; 102: 2916-2924Google Scholar). Furthermore, the highly conserved GPS motif-associated proteolysis suggests that this unique cleavage process is likely to be mediated by a common proteolytic mechanism and might be important for the function or regulation of the receptor. Indeed, the proteolysis of polycystin-1 has been found to be essential for its normal biological activity, since several autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease-associated point mutations were shown to disrupt the GPS cleavage and the function of polycystin-1 (41Qian F. Boletta A. Bhunia A.K. Xu H. Liu L. Ahrabi A.K. Watnick T.J. Zhou F. Germino G.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 16981-16986Google Scholar). The epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like module containing mucin-like hormone receptor 2 (EMR2) is a human myeloid-restricted EGF-TM7 receptor whose extracellular domain consists of tandem repeats of EGF-like modules followed by a Ser/Thr-rich stalk and a GPS motif (45Lin H.H. Stacey M. Hamann J. Gordon S. McKnight A.J. Genomics. 2000; 67: 188-200Google Scholar, 46Kwakkenbos M.J. Chang G.W. Lin H.H. Pouwels W. de Jong E.C. van Lier R.A. Gordon S. Hamann J. J. Leukocyte Biol. 2002; 71: 854-862Google Scholar). Our previous studies on the proteolysis of EMR2 have located the precise cleavage site to a conserved tripeptide (His-Leu↓Ser518) sequence and demonstrated that the cleavage requires not only the GPS motif but also other extracellular domains in the stalk region (47Chang G.W. Stacey M. Kwakkenbos M.J. Hamann J. Gordon S. Lin H.H. FEBS Lett. 2003; 547: 145-150Google Scholar). In the present study, we elucidate the molecular basis for the cleavage of EMR2 and demonstrate that no protease is required for the proteolytic reaction. Instead, we show that EMR2 is cleaved by a self-catalyzed process characteristic of the autoproteolytic reaction commonly employed by the Ntn-hydrolases (11Brannigan J.A. Dodson G. Duggleby H.J. Moody P.C. Smith J.L. Tomchick D.R. Murzin A.G. Nature. 1995; 378: 416-419Google Scholar). Materials—All chemicals and reagents were obtained from Sigma unless otherwise specified. The EMR2 stalk-specific 2A1 mAb (mouse IgG1) was a gift from Dr J. Hamann (University of Amsterdam, The Netherlands). Anti-Myc (mouse IgG1) and rabbit anti-GFP polyclonal Ab (Living Colors A.v. peptide antibody) were from Invitrogen and Clontech, respectively. Rabbit polyclonal Ab against the 300-kDa mannose 6-phosphate receptor was provided by Dr. D. Werling (RVC, London). Mouse mAbs against ERGIC-53 (mouse IgG1) and proteindisulfide isomerase (1D3, IgG1) were provided by Drs. H. P. Hauri (University of Basel, Switzerland) and David Vaux (Sir William Dunn School of Pathology, Oxford), respectively. Secondary antibodies used are Cy3-conjugated F(ab′)2 donkey anti-mouse IgG (Jackson Immunoresearch) and Alexa-Fluor 647-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Molecular Probes, Inc., Leiden, The Netherlands). Cell Culture—All culture media were supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum, 2 mm l-glutamine, 50 IU/ml penicillin, and 50 μg/ml streptomycin. All cells were incubated at 37 °C in a 5% CO2, 95% humidity incubator. Human embryonic kidney 293T cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and CHO-K1 cells in Ham's F-12 medium. EMR2 expression constructs were transfected into cells cultured in 100-mm dishes using LipofectAMINE™ (Invitrogen) as previously described (44Stacey M. Chang G.W. Davies J.Q. Kwakkenbos M.J. Sanderson R.D. Hamann J. Gordon S. Lin H.H. Blood. 2003; 102: 2916-2924Google Scholar, 48Lin H.H. Stacey M. Saxby C. Knott V. Chaudhry Y. Evans D. Gordon S. McKnight A.J. Handford P. Lea S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 24160-24169Google Scholar). Generation of the EMR2 Expression Constructs and EMR2 Fusion Proteins—The EMR2 fusion proteins employed in this report are depicted in Fig. 1A. All expression constructs were generated using standard molecular biology methods. In brief, the cDNA fragments encoding the EMR2 extracellular domain or the full-length EMR2 protein were subcloned in frame into appropriate expression vectors upstream of the protein tags via selected restriction sites. The vectors used are pcDNA3.1/myc-HIS (Invitrogen), pEGFP-N1 (Clontech), and pcDNA3.1/mFc vector as previously described (43Stacey M. Chang G.W. Sanos S.L. Chittenden L.R. Stubbs L. Gordon S. Lin H.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 29283-29293Google Scholar, 44Stacey M. Chang G.W. Davies J.Q. Kwakkenbos M.J. Sanderson R.D. Hamann J. Gordon S. Lin H.H. Blood. 2003; 102: 2916-2924Google Scholar). The EMR2 site-directed mutants were made according to the protocols suggested by the manufacturer (GeneEditor Mutagenesis System; Promega). For the construction of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-restricted expression vector, a cDNA fragment encoding the KDEL ER retention signal was amplified by PCR using pCMV/myc/ER (Clontech) as a template. The cDNA fragment was then subcloned immediately after the EMR2-EGFP sequence. All expression constructs were subjected to DNA sequencing to confirm their identities. EMR2 fusion proteins were produced by transient transfection of cells. 48–72 h post-transfection, the EMR2 fusion protein was collected from conditioned medium (CM) or total cell lysate (CL) of transfected cells. Briefly, CM was spun at 2,000 rpm at 4 °C for 20 min followed by 100,000 rpm at 4 °C for 20 min. The supernatant was collected and stored at -80 °C. Total cell lysates were collected in cell lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 5 mm MgCl2, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm AEBSF, 5 mm Levamisole, 1× complete™ (Roche Applied Science) protease inhibitors) at 4 °C. Protein concentration was determined by a Dc Protein Analysis Kit (Bio-Rad). For the purification of soluble EMR2-mFc fusion proteins, human embryonic kidney 293T cells were transfected with 40 μg of DNA/175-cm2 flask using calcium phosphate precipitation as previously described (43Stacey M. Chang G.W. Sanos S.L. Chittenden L.R. Stubbs L. Gordon S. Lin H.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 29283-29293Google Scholar, 44Stacey M. Chang G.W. Davies J.Q. Kwakkenbos M.J. Sanderson R.D. Hamann J. Gordon S. Lin H.H. Blood. 2003; 102: 2916-2924Google Scholar). The medium was replaced with 25 ml of serum-free Opti-MEM I 16–18 h post transfection and incubated for a further 72 h. Conditioned medium was collected, spun, and passed through a 0.45-μm filter, followed by Protein A-Sepharose 4 Fast Flow (Amersham Biosciences) column purification as previously described (43Stacey M. Chang G.W. Sanos S.L. Chittenden L.R. Stubbs L. Gordon S. Lin H.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 29283-29293Google Scholar, 44Stacey M. Chang G.W. Davies J.Q. Kwakkenbos M.J. Sanderson R.D. Hamann J. Gordon S. Lin H.H. Blood. 2003; 102: 2916-2924Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitation, Western Blotting, and Other Protein Analysis—EMR2 fusion proteins were immunoprecipitated from CM or CL using appropriate Abs and/or protein A/G beads. Briefly, CM (1 ml) and CL (100 μg) were either incubated with protein A/G-Sepharose directly or precleared with irrelevant Ab and protein A/G-Sepharose, followed by subsequent incubation with appropriate primary Ab and protein A/G-Sepharose, respectively. After extensive washes, the immunopurified proteins were subjected to in vitro cleavage reaction or glycosidase treatment as described. For the glycosidase treatment, the proteins were incubated with 1 unit of PNGase F (Roche Applied Science), 1 unit of endoglycosidase H (Roche Applied Science), or 0.5 milliunits of O-glycosidase (Roche Applied Science) plus 1.0 milliunit of neuraminidase in 20 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, at 37 °C for 20 h prior to Western blot analysis. For Western blotting, proteins were denatured in reducing sample buffer, subjected to electrophoresis in 8 or 10% SDS-PAGE gels, transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Immobilon-P; Millipore Corp.), and probed with 2A1 mAb, anti-Myc, or anti-GFP Ab. Following extensive washes, the blots were incubated with appropriate horseradish peroxidase-conjugated second Ab for ECL detection (Amersham Biosciences). The fluorescence intensity of EMR2-GFP fusion proteins was determined by a FLUOstar Galaxy fluorescence plate reader (BMG LabTechnologies Ltd., Aylesbury, UK) using an excitation wavelength at 485 nm and emission wavelength at 520 nm. Immunofluorescence Confocal Microscopy—Transfected cells grown on glass coverslips in 24-well tissue culture plates were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline, blocked, and permeabilized in blocking buffer (phosphate-buffered saline with 0.5% bovine serum albumin, 0.1% Triton X-100, and 1% normal donkey or goat serum) for 20 min at room temperature. Cells were then incubated sequentially for 1 h at room temperature with primary antibodies (5–10 μg/ml) and appropriate secondary antibody (5–10 μg/ml) diluted in the same blocking buffer with extensive washing in between incubations. Cells were then mounted onto glass slides with fluorescent mounting medium (Dako, Cambridgeshire, UK). Immunofluorescence was analyzed on a Bio-Rad Radiance 2000 laser-scanning confocal microscope. The resulting images were processed in Adobe® Photoshop® 6.0. In Vitro Cleavage of EMR2 Proteins—Immunoprecipitated EMR2 fusion proteins or those in CM and CL were incubated in cleavage buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 20 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA) with or without 250 mm NH2OH at 37 °C unless otherwise specified. At various time points, samples were withdrawn and analyzed by Western blotting. For the biochemical characterization of EMR2 autoproteolysis, samples were incubated in the cleavage buffer containing protease inhibitors or other test reagents such as EDTA, as indicated in the throughout. For the demonstration of intramolecular cleavage, EMR2-H516S-mFc fusion protein was first purified by Protein A chromatography as described above. Purified proteins were then incubated at different concentrations (0.2 and 1.0 mg/ml) in cleavage buffer alone at 37 °C. At various time points, samples were withdrawn, subjected to SDS-PAGE, and stained in Simply Blue™ Safe-Stain (Invitrogen). The intensity of the uncleaved precursor protein band (∼110 kDa) was determined from the image captured by a Gel Doc 2000 gel documentation system (Bio-Rad). Proteolytic Cleavage at the Highly Conserved GPS Motif Occurs in the ER—We and others have previously shown that the proteolytic cleavage of the GPS motif-containing receptors (GPS-receptors) is a TM-independent process and that the GPS motif is necessary but not sufficient for proteolysis to occur (41Qian F. Boletta A. Bhunia A.K. Xu H. Liu L. Ahrabi A.K. Watnick T.J. Zhou F. Germino G.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 16981-16986Google Scholar, 47Chang G.W. Stacey M. Kwakkenbos M.J. Hamann J.

To further investigate this unique proteolytic process, we first compared the GPS motifs of all GPS-receptors that are known to be processed (Fig. 1B). The GPS motif is evolutionary conserved and widely present in cell surface receptors, including members of the LNB-TM7 or class B2 GPCRs as well as receptors with one- or 11-pass TM configuration such as suREJ1 (39Moy G.W. Mendoza L.M. Schulz J.R. Swanson W.J. Glabe C.G. Vacquier V.D. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 809-817Google Scholar), polycystin-1 (41Qian F. Boletta A. Bhunia A.K. Xu H. Liu L. Ahrabi A.K. Watnick T.J. Zhou F. Germino G.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 16981-16986Google Scholar, 42Ponting C.P. Hofmann K. Bork P. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 585-588Google Scholar), and suREJ3 (40Mengerink K.J. Moy G.W. Vacquier V.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 943-948Google Scholar). The GPS motif is always located at the membrane-proximal region, ∼20–30 residues from the first TM domain. The cleavage site tripeptide is highly conserved: the P-2 residue is His, the P-1 residue is Leu (or Ile in the Drosophila Flamingo protein (34Usui T. Shima Y. Shimada Y. Hirano S. Burgess R.W. Schwarz T.L. Takeichi M. Uemura T. Cell. 1999; 98: 585-595Google Scholar)), and the P+1 residue is either Ser or Thr. N-terminal to the cleavage site are two invariable Trp residues and four constrained Cys residues believed to form two intramolecular disulfide bridges. One exception to the rule is polycystin-1 that contains only two Cys residues. C-terminal to the cleavage site are 6–8 small, hydrophobic residues that have been shown to be important both for proteolysis and noncovalent association of the cleaved subunits (47Chang G.W. Stacey M. Kwakkenbos M.J. Hamann J. Gordon S. Lin H.H. FEBS Lett. 2003; 547: 145-150Google Scholar). Overall, these features indicate that there is an ordered and complex structure surrounding the GPS cleavage site and suggest that all GPS-receptors probably undergo the same proteolytic process. To unveil the proteolytic mechanism at the GPS, we first investigated the subcellular compartment in which the proteolysis takes place. Previous pulse-chase experiments examining the cleavage of CD97, latrophilin/CL1 (calcium-independent receptor for latrotoxin (CIRL)/latrophilin), ETL, and Ig-Hepta have shown that the GPS proteolysis occurs very early (within 10–15 min) during protein biogenesis and suggested that it might occur in the ER (36Abe J. Fukuzawa T. Hirose S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 23391-23398Google Scholar, 49Krasnoperov V. Lu Y. Buryanovsky L. Neubert T.A. Ichtchenko K. Petrenko A.G. J. Biol.

To further confirm and locate the cleavage reaction in the ER, we took advantage of the specific ER retention signal, KDEL, and examined the proteolysis of KDEL-tagged EMR2-enhanced green fluorescence protein (EGFP) fusion proteins (Fig. 2). In addition to the wild type (WT) stalk, two other stalks containing a cleavage site-deficient S518A and a control S519A point mutation, respectively, were also used to demonstrate the specificity of the cleavage reaction. The KDEL-tagged fusion proteins were confirmed to localize in the ER by the following observations. First, whereas the soluble EMR2-EGFP fusion proteins (with no KDEL signal) were detected in both CM and the total CL, the KDEL-tagged fusion proteins were found only in the CL (Fig. 2A). Thus, the KDEL-tagged fusion proteins were expressed but retained inside the cells. Confocal immunofluorescence staining subsequently showed that the KDEL-tagged proteins co-localize with the ER-lumen resident proteins such as protein-disulfide isomerase and calreticulin (Fig. 2B) (data not shown). On the other hand, they showed only minimum co-localization with ERGIC-53, a mannose-specific membrane lectin involved in the transport of glycoproteins from the ER to the ER-Golgi intermediate compartment (52Hauri H.P. Kappeler F. Andersson H. Appenzeller C. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 587-596Google Scholar). No co-localization of the KDEL-tagged proteins with mannose 6-phosphate receptor that recycles between the trans-Golgi network and endosomes was found (53Boker C. von Figura K. Hille-Rehfeld A. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 1023-1032Google Scholar) (Fig. 2B). Finally, since EMR2 is heavily glycosylated, the KDEL-tagged EMR2 proteins were subjected to glycosidase digestion. N-Linked glycosylation is initiated in the ER lumen as a high mannosyl oligosaccharide, which is then modified to a complex form in the cis-Golgi compartment. Peptide:N-glycosidase F recognizes and digests N-glycosylated proteins between Asn and GlcNAc, whereas endoglycosidase H cleaves only the high mannose oligosaccharides. O-Glycosylation mainly takes place in the cis-Golgi compartment, so sensitivity to O-glycosidase digestion could also help indicate the subcellular localization of proteins. Western blot analysis showed that the KDEL-tagged proteins were sensitive to both peptide:N-glycosidase F and endoglycosidase H but were resistant to O-glycosidase digestion, indicating that these proteins have not trafficked out of the ER compartment (Fig. 2C). When analyzed for proteolytic cleavage, the KDEL-tagged EMR2-EGFP fusion protein containing the WT stalk or a control S519A point mutant stalk was shown to be effectively cleaved to two subunits, whereas the cleavage site-deficient (S518A) stalk did not (Fig. 2C). The same results were observed in several cell lines including CHO-K1, COS-7, human embryonic kidney 293T, and NIH3T3 (data not shown). Together, these and earlier results indicate that the GPS proteolytic cleavage is likely to be carried out by a conserved proteolytic machinery in the ER. EMR2 Proteolysis Is an Autoproteolytic Reaction—In order to identify the proposed ER-located proteolytic machinery, we first aimed to define the GPS cleavage site specificity. EMR2-mFc fusion proteins provide an efficient way for specific purification and detection of the protein and have been used previously to characterize EMR2 proteolysis (47Chang G.W. Stacey M. Kwakkenbos M.J. Hamann J. Gordon S. Lin H.H. FEBS Lett. 2003; 547: 145-150Google Scholar). Thus, a series of the EMR2-mFc fusion proteins were generated, where the Ser518 cleavage site residue was individually mutated to 19 other amino acids. As shown in Table I, proteolytic cleavage was detected in only three point mutants; the S518C and S518T mutants displayed the same efficient pr"
https://openalex.org/W2146278300,"Metastasis is a leading cause of mortality and morbidity in cancer. Urokinase (uPA), only expressed by the highly invasive cancer cells, has been implicated in invasion, metastases, and angiogenesis of several malignancies including breast cancer. Because uPA expression is strongly correlated with its hypomethylated state, we utilized the uPA gene in the highly invasive MDA-231 human breast cancer cells as a model system to test the hypothesis that pharmacological reversal of the uPA promoter hypomethylation would result in its silencing and inhibition of metastasis. <i>S</i>-Adenosyl-l-methionine (AdoMet) has previously been shown to cause hypermethylation and inhibit demethylation. Treatment of MDA-231 cells with AdoMet, but not its unmethylated analogue <i>S</i>-adenosylhomocysteine, significantly inhibits uPA expression and tumor cell invasion <i>in vitro</i> and tumor growth and metastasis <i>in vivo</i>. The effects of AdoMet on uPA expression were reversed by the demethylating agent 5′-azacytidine, supporting the conclusion that AdoMet effects are caused by hypermethylation. Knockdown of the methyl-binding protein 2 also causes a significant inhibition of uPA expression <i>in vitro</i> and tumor growth and metastasis <i>in vivo</i>. These treatments did not have any effects on estrogen receptor expression, suggesting that inhibition of hypomethylation will not affect genes already silenced by hypermethylation. These data are consistent with the hypothesis that hypomethylation of critical genes like uPA plays a causal role in metastasis. Inhibition of hypomethylation can thus be used as a novel therapeutic approach to silence the pro-metastatic gene uPA and block breast cancer progression into the aggressive and metastatic stages of the disease."

The effect is mediated allosterically by a communication between the Na+ site and regions involved in substrate recognition. Using a panel of 78 Ala mutants of thrombin, we have mapped the allosteric core of residues that are energetically linked to Na+ binding. These residues are Asp-189, Glu-217, Asp-222, and Tyr-225, all in close proximity to the bound Na+. Among these residues, Asp-189 shares with Asp-221 the important function of transducing Na+ binding into enhanced catalytic activity. None of the residues of exosite I, exosite II, or the 60-loop plays a significant role in Na+ binding and allosteric transduction. X-ray crystal structures of the Na+-free (slow) and Na+-bound (fast) forms of thrombin, free or bound to the active site inhibitor H-d-Phe-Pro-Arg-chloromethyl-ketone, document the conformational changes induced by Na+ binding. The slow → fast transition results in formation of the Arg-187:Asp-222 ion pair, optimal orientation of Asp-189 and Ser-195 for substrate binding, and a significant shift of the side chain of Glu-192 linked to a rearrangement of the network of water molecules that connect the bound Na+ to Ser-195 in the active site. The changes in the water network and the allosteric core explain the thermodynamic signatures linked to Na+ binding and the mechanism of thrombin activation by Na+.

Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 11721-11730Google Scholar). This property is a variation on the common theme encountered within the large family of monovalent cation-activated enzymes that typically use K+ as an activator (7Suelter C.H.

Na+ activation is also observed in other enzymes involved in blood coagulation and the immune response but not in digestive and degradative enzymes like trypsin and chymotrypsin (9Dang Q.D.

Chem. 1997; 272: 29987-29990Google Scholar, 14Perona J.J. Hedstrom L. Rutter W.J. Fletterick R.J. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 1489-1499Google Scholar, 15Hedstrom L. Chem. Rev. 2002; 102: 4501-4524Google Scholar). The Na+ binding sites of coagulation factor Xa (16Zhang E. Tulinsky A. Biophys. Chem. 1997; 63: 185-200Google Scholar) and activated protein C (17Schmidt A.E. Padmanabhan K. Underwood M.C. Bode W. Mather T. Bajaj S.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 28987-28995Google Scholar) are similarly located and arranged structurally. Binding of Na+ to thrombin enhances the kcat/Km toward small chromogenic substrates by significantly increasing the rate of diffusion into the active site and the rate of acylation (6Wells C.M. Di Cera E. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 11721-11730Google Scholar, 18Krem M.M. Prasad S. Di Cera E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 40260-40264Google Scholar). The effect is exquisitely allosteric because the Na+ binding site is located away from residues of the catalytic triad or involved directly in substrate recognition. The binding of Na+ also influences recognition of macromolecular substrates like fibrinogen and PAR1 and manifests itself physiologically as a significant procoagulant and prothrombotic effect (19Di Cera E. Chest. 2003; 124: 11S-17SGoogle Scholar, 20Dang O.D. Vindigni A. Di Cera E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5977-5981Google Scholar). Analogous procoagulant effects of Na+ have been reported for factor Xa (21Rezaie A.R. He X. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 1817-1825Google Scholar, 22Camire R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 37863-37870Google Scholar). The synergism between thrombin and factor Xa in initiating and maintaining blood coagulation (1Mann K.G. Chest. 2003; 124: 4S-10SGoogle Scholar, 2Mann K.G. Butenas S. Brummel K. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2003; 23: 17-25Google Scholar) supports a key role for Na+ in promoting blood clotting. The physiologic importance of the Na+ effect on thrombin is demonstrated by the bleeding phenotypes observed with prothrombins Frankfurt (23Degen S.J. McDowell S.A. Sparks L.M. Scharrer I. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1995; 73: 203-209Google Scholar), Salakta (24Miyata T. Aruga R. Umeyama H. Bezeaud A. Guillin M.C. Iwanaga S. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 7457-7462Google Scholar), Greenville (25Henriksen R.A. Dunham C.K. Miller L.D. Casey J.T. Menke J.B. Knupp C.L. Usala S.J. Blood. 1998; 91: 2026-2031Google Scholar), and Scranton (26Sun W.Y. Smirnow D. Jenkins M.L. Degen S.J. Thromb. Haemostasis. 2001; 85: 651-654Google Scholar), where the mutations compromise Na+ binding. Furthermore, changes in the Na+ concentration of plasma resulting in hypernatremia ([Na+] > 145 mm) or hyponatremia ([Na+] < 135 mm) are among the most common electrolyte disorders encountered by primary care providers, nephrologists, and pediatricians (27Adrogue H.J. Madias N.E. N. Engl. J. Med. 2000; 342: 1493-1499Google Scholar, 28Adrogue H.J. Madias N.E. N. Engl. J. Med. 2000; 342: 1581-1589Google Scholar) and are often associated with thrombosis or bleeding, respectively (19Di Cera E. Chest. 2003; 124: 11S-17SGoogle Scholar). Even under physiologic conditions, the Na+ concentration of plasma drops drastically around platelet thrombi in vivo (29Owen W.G. Bichler J. Ericson D. Wysokinski W. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 9277-9281Google Scholar), lending further support to the importance of Na+ in controlling the roles of thrombin and other enzymes in blood coagulation and thrombosis. Under physiologic conditions of [Na+] (140 mm), pH and temperature, the Kd for Na+ binding to thrombin is 110 mm (6Wells C.M. Di Cera E. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 11721-11730Google Scholar, 30Guinto E.R. Di Cera E. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 8800-8804Google Scholar, 31Griffon N. Di Stasio E. Biophys. Chem. 2001; 90: 89-96Google Scholar), which implies that nearly half of the thrombin molecules generated in vivo from prothrombin are in the Na+-free slow form. This basic property of thrombin was discovered in 1992 (6Wells C.M. Di Cera E. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 11721-11730Google Scholar), but since then the Protein Data Bank has accumulated >150 structures of the enzyme that, with only one exception, have been solved in the presence of Na+ and portray thrombin in the fast form. The first and only structure of thrombin in the slow form was reported in 2002 (32Pineda A.O. Savvides S.N. Waksman G. Di Cera E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 40177-40180Google Scholar). This is also the first structure of the enzyme solved in the absence of any active site or exosite ligands that bias the conformation in favor of the Na+-bound fast form (33Ayala Y. Di Cera E. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 235: 733-746Google Scholar, 34Lai M.T. Di Cera E. Shafer J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30275-30282Google Scholar). The structure of the free slow form, solved at 2.8-Å resolution, documents intriguing changes in the environment of Asp-189 and Ser-195, together with a paucity of water molecules in the vacant Na+ site and the neighbor primary specificity pocket (32Pineda A.O. Savvides S.N. Waksman G. Di Cera E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 40177-40180Google Scholar). These changes are borne out by comparing the free slow form with the PPACK 1The abbreviation used are: PPACK, H-d-Phe-Pro-Arg-chloromethylketone; FPR, H-d-Phe-Pro-Arg-p-nitroanilide; PEG, polyethylene glycol; MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid; BisTris, 2-[bis(2-hydroxyethyl)amino]-2-(hydroxymethyl)propane-1,3-diol; r.m.s., root mean square. -inhibited (35Bode W. Turk D. Karshikov A. Protein Sci. 1992; 1: 426-471Google Scholar) or hirugen-inhibited (36Vijayalakshmi J. Padmanabhan K.P. Mann K.G. Tulinsky A. Protein Sci. 1994; 3: 2254-2271Google Scholar) fast form of the enzyme. Important questions therefore remain as to whether the observed changes in the free slow form are due to the absence of Na+ or PPACK and whether the lack of solvent in the water channel embedding the Na+ site is an artifact due to the low resolution of the slow form structure. These questions are best addressed by solving the structures of thrombin in the four possible ligated intermediates with Na+ and PPACK, which is a suicide inhibitor mimic of the specific chromogenic substrate of thrombin H-d-Phe-Pro-Arg-p-nitroanilide (FPR). A key reagent used for these studies is the thrombin mutant R77aA that abrogates the site of autoproteolytic cleavage in exosite I (37Hofsteenge J. Braun P.J. Stone S.R. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 2144-2151Google Scholar). That enables crystallization of the free form of the enzyme without introducing changes into active site residues, like Ser-195, that are now known to bear important signatures of the allosteric transition of the enzyme. Here we present the high resolution structures of the four intermediates (free thrombin, thrombin bound to Na+, thrombin bound to PPACK, thrombin bound to PPACK and Na+) that define the detailed changes linked to Na+ binding in the absence and presence of an active site ligand. In addition, we complement the structural investigation with an extensive Ala-scanning mutagenesis mapping of thrombin residues located in exosite I, exosite II, the 60-loop, the specificity sites S1–S4, and the Na+ binding environment. The mapping identifies the allosteric core of residues energetically linked to Na+ binding and the residues responsible for the Na+-induced enhancement of catalytic activity toward the chromogenic substrate FPR, which is a relevant reporter of the interaction of the active site of thrombin with fibrinogen and PAR1 (38Ayala Y.M. Cantwell A.M. Rose T. Bush L.A. Arosio D. Di Cera E. Proteins. 2001; 45: 107-116Google Scholar). The resulting functional and structural information offers unprecedented details on the molecular origin of thrombin allostery that carries over to the study of similar effects in related proteases involved in blood coagulation and the immune response. Site-directed mutants of human thrombin were expressed, purified, and tested for activity as described (38Ayala Y.M. Cantwell A.M. Rose T. Bush L.A. Arosio D. Di Cera E. Proteins. 2001; 45: 107-116Google Scholar, 39Pineda A.O. Cantwell A.M. Bush L.A. Rose T. Di Cera E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 32015-32019Google Scholar). The equilibrium dissociation constant for Na+ binding was determined by fluorescence titration using a FluoroMax-3 SPEX spectrophotometer, under experimental conditions of 5 mm Tris, 0.1% PEG-8000, pH 8.0 at 10 °C, I = 800 mm (8Prasad S. Wright K.J. Roy D.B. Bush L.A. Cantwell A.M. Di Cera E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 13785-13790Google Scholar, 18Krem M.M. Prasad S. Di Cera E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 40260-40264Google Scholar). The effect of Na+ on substrate hydrolysis was assessed from the linkage between the kcat/Km for FPR hydrolysis and [Na+], under conditions of 5 mm Tris, 0.1% PEG-8000, pH 8.0 at 25 °C, in the presence of 200 mm NaCl or choline chloride. The value of s = kcat/Km, corrected for product inhibition when present (40Krem M.M. Di Cera E. Biophys. Chem. 2003; 100: 315-323Google Scholar), was calculated from the individual Km and kcat values derived from analysis of progress curves run at different substrate concentrations (from 5 up to 60 μm) and was fit according to the following equation (18Krem M.M. Prasad S. Di Cera E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 40260-40264Google Scholar, 41Di Cera E. Hopfner K.P. Dang Q.D. Biophys. J. 1996; 70: 174-181Google Scholar), s=s0+s1[Na+]Kd1+[Na+]Kd=s01+α[Na+]Kd1+[Na+]Kd Eq.1 where s0 and s1 are the values of kcat/Km in the slow and fast form, respectively, and α = s1/s0 is the extent of allosteric enhancement due to Na+ binding. The value of s0 is derived in the presence of the inert cation Ch+ (200 mm choline chloride), whereas the value of s1 is inferred from the value of s0, s, and Kd. The values of Kd measured by fluorescence at 10 °C, 800 mm ionic strength, were found to be nearly identical to those measured at 25 °C, 200 mm ionic strength. This is a consequence of the compensating effects between the heat capacity change and ionic strength dependence associated with Na+ binding to thrombin (30Guinto E.R. Di Cera E. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 8800-8804Google Scholar). The important property of Equation 1 is that it contains three independent parameters, which means that the extent of allosteric activation (α) is not necessarily linked to s0 or to the strength of Na+ binding (Kd). As a result, mutation of the enzyme may affect any one of these three independent parameters or any combination thereof. Mutagenesis studies can therefore identify the role of specific residues in Na+ binding (effect on Kd) and/or allosteric transduction (effect on α). The R77aA mutant of thrombin was used as the key reagent for all structural studies. This mutant prevents the autoproteolytic digestion of thrombin at exosite I (37Hofsteenge J. Braun P.J. Stone S.R. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 2144-2151Google Scholar) and enabled the structure of this enzyme to be obtained in the absence of any active site or exosite inhibitors for the first time (32Pineda A.O. Savvides S.N. Waksman G. Di Cera E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 40177-40180Google Scholar). An important and most desirable property of the R77aA mutation is that it has no effect on the Na+ binding properties or the catalytic activity of the enzyme (38Ayala Y.M. Cantwell A.M. Rose T. Bush L.A. Arosio D. Di Cera E. Proteins. 2001; 45: 107-116Google Scholar, 39Pineda A.O. Cantwell A.M. Bush L.A. Rose T. Di Cera E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 32015-32019Google Scholar). The mutant was concentrated to 14 mg/ml in 50 mm choline chloride, 20 mm MES, pH 6.0. For crystallization with PPACK, the mutant was mixed with PPACK at a molar ratio of 1:15 and incubated at room temperature for 1 h. Crystallization was achieved at 25 °C by vapor diffusion, with each crystallization well containing 500 μl of reservoir solution. Equal volumes of the protein sample and reservoir solution (2.5 μl each) were mixed to prepare the hanging drops. Reservoir solution for the different forms were as follows: free slow form (S), 14% PEG-2000 monomethyl ether, 0.1 m Tris, pH 7.5; free fast form (F), 19% PEG-2000 monomethyl ether, 0.1 m BisTris, pH 6.6, 200 mm NaCl; PPACK-bound slow form (SL): 12% PEG-2000 monomethyl ether, 0.1 m Tris, pH 7.6; PPACK-bound fast form (FL), 14% PEG-2000 monomethyl ether, 0.1 m Tris, pH 7.6, 200 mm NaCl. Diffraction quality crystals (∼0.1 × 0.1 × 0.4 mm for S, ∼0.1 × 0.1 × 0.4 mm for F, ∼0.1 × 0.1 × 0.9 mm for SL, ∼0.1 × 0.1 × 0.6 mm for FL) were grown after 7 days. Crystals were cryoprotected in a solution similar to its reservoir solution but containing 5% additional PEG-2000 monomethyl ether and 25% glycerol prior to flash-freezing. Data were collected at the Advanced Photon Source (beamline Biocars 14-ID, Argonne National Laboratory) and processed using the HKL2000 package (42Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326PubMed Google Scholar). The crystals were orthorhombic of space group P212121 and contained two molecules per asymmetric unit. The A monomer of each structure was used for structural comparisons among the four crystals. Except for surface residues subject to an asymmetric crystalline environment, the differences between the A and B monomers in the asymmetric unit of each crystal were found to be negligible, including in the regions bearing the bulk of the structural changes linked to the slow → fast transition. The final refinement and model quality statistics are presented in Table I. The S and F structures were solved by molecular replacement using the coordinates of the thrombin-PPACK complex (35Bode W. Turk D. Karshikov A. Protein Sci. 1992; 1: 426-471Google Scholar) and the program package CNS (43Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Google Scholar). Crystallographic refinement was carried out by simulated annealing and conjugated-gradient minimization using CNS (43Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Google Scholar). Model building was performed with the program O (44Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Google Scholar). The structures of FL and SL were solved using the same coordinates of the thrombin-PPACK complex (35Bode W. Turk D. Karshikov A. Protein Sci. 1992; 1: 426-471Google Scholar) and the program package CCP4 (45Bailey S. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Google Scholar). Crystallographic refinement of FL and SL was carried out by several cycles of conjugate-gradient minimization of atomic positions and temperature factor refinement in the program package CNS. Model building was performed with the program XTALVIEW (46McRee D.E. J. Struct. Biol. 1999; 125: 156-165Google Scholar). The autolysis loop is well defined in the SL structure but could not be resolved in the FL, S, and F structures. Water molecules were added in the final stage of the refinement process. They were subject to visual inspection to check their positioning in electron density and allowed to refine freely. Water molecules with temperature factor (B factor) higher than 80 Å2 were excluded from subsequent refinement steps. All solvent molecules were checked with the program WASP for correct coordination and Na+ specific valence (47Nayal M. Di Cera E. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 256: 228-234Google Scholar). The valence for Na+ bound to F and FL was 1.00 v.u. in both cases and the B factor was 53 (F) and 27 (FL) Å2. No water molecule was found to have a Na+ specific valence > 0.5 v.u. in any of the four structures analyzed. Structural comparisons were computed using LSQMAN (48Kleywegt G.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1999; 55: 1878-1884Google Scholar). Coordinates of the structures of the R77aA thrombin mutant in the S, F, SL, and FL forms have been deposited to the Protein Data Bank (accession codes: 1SGI for S, 1SG8 for F, 1SHH for SL, 1SFQ for FL).Table ICrystallographic data on the slow and fast forms of thrombinSFSLFLData collection1SGI1SG81SHH1SFQWavelength (Å)0.90.90.90.9Space groupP212121P212121P212121P212121Unit cell dimensions (Å)a = 61.8a = 59.5a = 61.4a = 61.3b = 68.1b = 65.6b = 68.3b = 68.2c = 162.7c = 162.4c = 162.9c = 162.9Resolution range (Å)30–2.330–2.340–1.5540–1.9Observations144,752138,252524,286309,158Unique observations27,03227,06894,51053,183Completeness86.0 (40.2)92.9 (70.9)94.0 (62.9)99.4 (96.2)Rsym (%)5.5 (17.9)7.8 (25.7)5.6 (35.1)4.7 (21.5)I/σ(I)24.1 (5.3)16.9 (2.6)27.4 (2.4)34.2 (6.5)RefinementResolution (Å)25.0–2.325.0–2.325.0–1.5525.0–1.9|F|/σ(|F|)>0>0>0>0Rcryst, Rfree0.200, 0.2510.212, 0.2340.195, 0.2170.191, 0.222Reflections (working/test)24,288/1,78722,836/1,72487,597/4,60848,669/4,448Protein atoms4526449146524600Solvent molecules323345483326r.m.s. deviation bond lengthsar.m.s. deviation from ideal bond lengths and angles and r.m.s. deviation in B factors of bonded atoms (Å)0.0060.0070.0100.011r.m.s. deviation anglesar.m.s. deviation from ideal bond lengths and angles and r.m.s. deviation in B factors of bonded atoms (°)1.31.41.61.6r.m.s. deviation ΔB valuesar.m.s. deviation from ideal bond lengths and angles and r.m.s. deviation in B factors of bonded atoms (Å2) (m.c./s.c.)bm.c., main chain; s.c., side chain2.6/4.02.6/4.02.1/4.01.8/3.0〈B〉 protein, molecule A (Å2)42502429〈B〉 protein, molecule B (Å2)39492330〈B〉 solvent (Å2)45513436Ramachandran plotcCalculated using PROCHCK (102)Most favored (%)83.583.185.786.2Additionally allowed (%)15.516.713.612.8Disallowed (%)0.20.00.20.2a r.m.s. deviation from ideal bond lengths and angles and r.m.s. deviation in B factors of bonded atomsb m.c., main chain; s.c., side chainc Calculated using PROCHCK (102Morris A.L. MacArthur M.W. Hutchinson E.G. Thornton J.M. Proteins. 1992; 12: 345-364Google Scholar) Open table in a new tab Seventy-eight residues of thrombin located in the most critical functional regions of the enzyme, i.e. exosite I, exosite II, the 60-loop, the specificity sites S1–S4, and the Na+ binding site, were targeted by mutagenesis, and the Na+ binding affinity was measured for each of them (Fig. 1). The functional epitope for Na+ binding mapped by Ala-scanning mutagenesis defines the “allosteric core” of residues linked to the slow → fast transition. These residues also represent prime candidates for identifying structural changes linked to Na+ binding, although incomplete overlap often exists between functional and structural epitopes (39Pineda A.O. Cantwell A.M. Bush L.A. Rose T. Di Cera E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 32015-32019Google Scholar, 49Greenspan N.S. Di Cera E. Nat. Biotechnol. 1999; 17: 936-937Google Scholar, 50Clackson T. Wells J.A.

Practically all residues of the allosteric core cluster around the Na+ site and none of them resides in exosite I, exosite II, or the 60-loop (Fig. 2). Na+ binding is severely compromised (>30-fold increase in Kd) upon mutation of Asp-189, Glu-217, Asp-222, and Tyr-225 that reside within 5 Å from the bound Na+ (Fig. 3). Asp-189 fixes the orientation of one of the four water molecules ligating Na+ and provides an important link between the Na+ site and the P1 residue of substrate (52Prasad S. Cantwell A.M. Bush L.A. Shih P. Xu H. Di Cera E. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 10103-10108Google Scholar). Glu-217 makes polar contacts with Lys-224 and Thr-172 that help stabilize the intervening 220-loop in the Na+ site. Mutation of Lys-224 and Thr-172 also affects Na+ binding, although to a lesser extent compared with E217A. Notably, the naturally occurring mutant prothrombin Scranton carries the K224T substitution and is associated with a bleeding phenotype due to reduced Na+ binding (26Sun W.Y. Smirnow D. Jenkins M.L. Degen S.J. Thromb. Haemostasis. 2001; 85: 651-654Google Scholar). The ion pair between Arg-187 and Asp-222 latches the 186-loop onto the 220-loop to stabilize the Na+ site and the pore of entry of the cation to its binding site (8Prasad S. Wright K.J. Roy D.B. Bush L.A. Cantwell A.M. Di Cera E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 13785-13790Google Scholar). Mutation of Arg-187 also affects Na+ binding, although to a lesser extent compared with D222A. The naturally occurring mutant prothrombin Greenville carries the R187Q substitution and is associated with a bleeding phenotype, again due to reduced Na+ binding (25Henriksen R.A. Dunham C.K. Miller L.D. Casey J.T. Menke J.B. Knupp C.L. Usala S.J. Blood. 1998; 91: 2026-2031Google Scholar). Tyr-225 plays a crucial role in determining the Na+-dependent allosteric nature of serine proteases (9Dang Q.D. Di Cera E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 10653-10656Google Scholar) by allowing the correct orientation of the backbone O atom of residue 224 (53Guinto E.R. Caccia S. Rose T. Futterer K. Waksman G. Di Cera E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 1852-1857Google Scholar), which contributes directly to the coordination of Na+. The side chain of Tyr-225 also secures the integrity of the water channel embedding the primary specificity pocket, which is required for correct substrate recognition (53Guinto E.R. Caccia S. Rose T. Futterer K. Waksman G. Di Cera E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The bound Na+ is shown in blue with its coordinating water molecules (red balls). H-bonds are depicted as broken lines. Residues are color-coded as described in the legend to Fig. 2. Note the spatial proximity of the residues within the allosteric core and their close interactions with those affecting the Na+ affinity >10-fold (yellow, Gly-223 is not labeled). Other residues affecting the Na+ affinity >3-fold (green) or <3-fold (cyan) are shown as backbone traces, except Asp-221 that plays a key role in transducing Na+ binding into enhanced catalytic activity, Glu-192, the active site Ser-195 and Val-163 near the side chain of Tyr-225. Residues not subject to mutagenesis are shown as backbone traces in gray.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The four residues of the allosteric core occupy crucial positions around the bound Na+ and help maintain the integrity of the coordination shell around the bound cation. The allosteric core is assisted by another set of residues whose Ala substitution affects Na+ binding >10-fold. These residues are Thr-172, Tyr-184a, Arg-187, Ser-214, and Gly-223. Residue 172 plays a crucial role in determining the primary specificity of trypsin and chymotrypsin (54Hedstrom L. Perona J.J. Rutter W.J. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 8757-8763Google Scholar). In thrombin, Thr-172 is oriented away from the primary specificity pocket and assumes a new role by H-bonding to Glu-217 (Fig. 3) and making contacts with Ile-174 in the aromatic S3-S4 recognition site (35Bode W. Turk D. Karshikov A. Protein Sci. 1992; 1: 426-471Google Scholar). In this manner, Thr-172 links Glu-217 in the allosteric core to residues involved in substrate recognition. Tyr-184a provides an anchor to a water molecule that participates in Na+ coordination. In the structure of thrombin bound to Rb+ (12Di Cera E. Guinto E.R. Vindigni A. Dang Q.D. Ayala Y.M. Wuyi M. Tulinsky A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22089-22092Google Scholar), and in the structure of activated protein C bound to Na+ (17Schmidt A.E. Padmanabhan K. Underwood M.C. Bode W. Mather T. Bajaj S.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 28987-28995Google Scholar), the backbone O atom of this residue directly coordinates the cation. Arg-187 is ion-paired to Asp-222 in the allosteric core. Ser-214 controls substrate dissociation from the active site (18Krem M.M. Prasad S. Di Cera E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 40260-40264Google Scholar) and assists the catalytic triad in its function (15Hedstrom L. Chem. Rev. 2002; 102: 4501-4524Google Scholar). Gly-223 makes an important H-bond through its backbone N atom with one of the four water molecules in the Na+ coordination shell. Taken together, the four residues of the allosteric core (Asp-189, Glu-217, Asp-222, Tyr-225) and their five partners (Thr-172, Tyr-184a, Arg-187, Ser-214, Gly-223) form"

https://openalex.org/W2086274306,"Ribavirin is one of the few nucleoside analogues currently used in the clinic to treat RNA virus infections, but its mechanism of action remains poorly understood at the molecular level. Here, we show that ribavirin 5′-triphosphate inhibits the activity of the dengue virus 2′-O-methyltransferase NS5 domain (NS5MTaseDV). Along with several other guanosine 5′-triphosphate analogues such as acyclovir, 5-ethynyl-1-β-d-ribofuranosylimidazole-4-carboxamide (EICAR), and a series of ribose-modified ribavirin analogues, ribavirin 5′-triphosphate competes with GTP to bind to NS5MTaseDV. A structural view of the binding of ribavirin 5′-triphosphate to this enzyme was obtained by determining the crystal structure of a ternary complex consisting of NS5MTaseDV, ribavirin 5′-triphosphate, and S-adenosyl-l-homocysteine at a resolution of 2.6 Å. These detailed atomic interactions provide the first structural insights into the inhibition of a viral enzyme by ribavirin 5′-triphosphate, as well as the basis for rational drug design of antiviral agents with improved specificity against the emerging flaviviruses.

These detailed atomic interactions provide the first structural insights into the inhibition of a viral enzyme by ribavirin 5′-triphosphate, as well as the basis for rational drug design of antiviral agents with improved specificity against the emerging flaviviruses. The guanosine analogue ribavirin is a broad spectrum antiviral agent discovered almost 30 years ago (1Sidwell R.W. Huffman J.H. Khare G.P. Allen L.B. Witkowski J.T. Robins R.K. Science. 1972; 177: 705-706Crossref PubMed Scopus (854) Google Scholar). Since its discovery, many mechanisms of action have been proposed (reviewed in Refs. 2Patterson J.L. Fernandez-Larsson R. Rev. Infect. Dis. 1990; 12: 1139-1146Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar and 3Hong Z. Cameron C.E. Prog. Drug Res. 2002; 59: 41-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Like most nucleoside analogues, ribavirin is phosphorylated by cellular kinases at its 5′-position upon entry into the cell. Ribavirin 5′-monophosphate is a potent inhibitor of the cellular enzyme inosine 5′-monophosphate dehydrogenase. This inhibition results in the depletion of the intracellular guanosine nucleotide pool, which feeds capping and polymerase enzymes from both viral and cellular origin. Consequently, the depressed guanosine nucleotide pool may exert an indirect antiviral effect, since viral enzymes would not compete advantageously for guanosine nucleotides with cellular enzymes. In addition, ribavirin nucleotides may have a viral target, such as RNA polymerization and RNA capping or induce lethal mutagenesis of viral genomes (4Crotty S. Maag D. Arnold J.J. Zhong W. Lau J.Y. Hong Z. Andino R. Cameron C.E. Nat. Med. 2000; 6: 1375-1379Crossref PubMed Scopus (697) Google Scholar), accounting for the observed antiviral effect. Both direct and indirect mechanisms may thus contribute to the ribavirin mode of action. To date, ribavirin nucleotides have been crystallized with two cellular enzymes, namely inosine 5′-monophosphate dehydrogenase (5Prosise G.L. Wu J.Z. Luecke H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 50654-50659Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) and nucleoside diphosphate kinase (NDPK (6Gallois-Montbrun S. Chen Y. Dutartre H. Sophys M. Morera S. Guerreiro C. Schneider B. Mulard L. Janin J. Veron M. Deville-Bonne D. Canard B. Mol. Pharmacol. 2003; 63: 538-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar)) but not with any viral enzyme or protein. The genus Flavivirus comprises important human pathogens such as West Nile, dengue, and yellow fever viruses, which are moderately sensitive to ribavirin (7Neyts J. Meerbach A. McKenna P. De Clercq E. Antiviral Res. 1996; 30: 125-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 8Jordan I. Briese T. Fischer N. Lau J.Y. Lipkin W.I. J. Infect.

These mosquito-borne viruses are currently expanding their distribution throughout the world. The introduction of West Nile virus in North America may be an important milestone in the history of this virus, as exemplified by outbreaks in the New York area (10Anderson J.F. Andreadis T.G. Vossbrinck C.R. Tirrell S. Wakem E.M. French R.A. Garmendia A.E. Van Kruiningen H.J. Science. 1999; 286: 2331-2333Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar) followed by the gradual spread to 47 of the 49 continental states of the United States of America (www.cdc.gov/ncidod/dvbid/westnile/index.htm). The Camargue area in France has re-witnessed West Nile viral infection of horses after 40 years, and the first human cases were reported in the French Riviera in October 2003. Likewise, dengue virus, an agent responsible for hemorrhagic fever, infects more than 50 million persons annually with an increasing incidence in tropical areas around the world. The single-stranded RNA genome of flaviviruses is of positive polarity, and is capped with a cap 1 structure Me7GpppA2′OMe (11Chambers T.J. Hahn C.S. Galler R. Rice C.M. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1990; 44: 649-688Crossref PubMed Scopus (1589) Google Scholar). The N-terminal domain of the dengue virus polymerase NS5 is a 2′-O-methyltransferase that is active on RNA cap structures (12Egloff M.P. Benarroch D. Selisko B. Romette J.L. Canard B. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 2757-2768Crossref PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar). This enzyme, referred to as NS5MTaseDV, is able to bind a GTP molecule that may mimic the RNA cap structure prior to methylation. Thus, it was of interest to determine whether guanosine analogues could bind to the GTP binding site of NS5MTaseDV. If so, guanosine analogues may act as potential competitive inhibitors of RNA cap binding and aid in the rational design of inhibitors directed against flaviviruses. In this report, we present biochemical evidence that ribavirin 5′-triphosphate (RTP) 1The abbreviations used are: RTP, ribavirin 5′-triphosphate; RMP, ribavirin 5′-monophosphate; SAHC, S-adenosyl-l-homocysteine; PDB, Protein Data Bank; EICAR, 5-ethynyl-1-β-d-ribofuranosylimidazole-4-carboxamide; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography; GDPMP, β-γ-methylene GTP.1The abbreviations used are: RTP, ribavirin 5′-triphosphate; RMP, ribavirin 5′-monophosphate; SAHC, S-adenosyl-l-homocysteine; PDB, Protein Data Bank; EICAR, 5-ethynyl-1-β-d-ribofuranosylimidazole-4-carboxamide; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography; GDPMP, β-γ-methylene GTP. inhibits the 2′-O-methyltransferase activity of dengue virus NS5MTaseDV. We also show that a series of RTP analogues, as well as EICAR 5′-triphosphate (EICAR-TP) and acyclovir 5′-triphosphate (acyclovir-TP), compete with GTP for binding to NS5MTaseDv. In addition to show that RTP and GTP share a common binding site on NS5MTaseDV, the crystal structure of the RTP-NS5MTaseDV complex reveals a unique mode of binding for the ribavirin pseudobase that is consistent with a lack of discrimination of this antiviral molecule relative to GTP. Enzymes and Reagents—The purification and crystallization of the NS5 capping domain of the dengue virus RNA-dependent RNA polymerase has been described (12Egloff M.P. Benarroch D. Selisko B. Romette J.L. Canard B. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 2757-2768Crossref PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar). Synthesis and purification of RTP, ribavirin nucleotide analogues, and acyclovir 5′-TP to homogeneity, as determined by 1H, 13C, and 31P NMR and HPLC, have been described (6Gallois-Montbrun S. Chen Y. Dutartre H. Sophys M. Morera S. Guerreiro C. Schneider B. Mulard L. Janin J. Veron M. Deville-Bonne D. Canard B. Mol. Pharmacol. 2003; 63: 538-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). EICAR 5′-TP was a kind gift from P. Herdewijn (Leuven, Belgium). All other nonradioactive and 32P-labeled nucleotides were of HPLC grade and purchased from Amersham Biosciences. Inhibition of RNA 2′-O-Methyltransferase Activity by RTP—The methyltransferase assay was performed in 40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.1. 100 μmS-adenosylmethionine with 10 μCi of Ado[methyl-3H]Met (74 Ci/mmol; Amersham Biosciences) were incubated with 2 μg of purified NS5MTaseDV, 35 μl of RNA substrate, and various concentrations of ribavirin 5′-triphosphate (50, 100, 250, 300, 500 and 750 μm) in a 50-μl reaction mix (12Egloff M.P. Benarroch D. Selisko B. Romette J.L. Canard B. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 2757-2768Crossref PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar). The RNA substrate mix was produced using purified T7 DNA primase in conjunction with the synthetic DNA oligonucleotide T10CTG5 (10 μm), 300 μm CTP, and 200 μm cap analogue to obtain capped AC5 (GpppAC5 and and m7GpppAC5) as described (13Matsuo H. Moriguchi T. Tagaki T. Kusakabe T. Buratowski S. Sekine M. Kyogoku Y. Wagner G. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2000; 122: 2417-2421Crossref Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The methyl-transfer reaction was incubated at 30 °C and monitored from 30 min to 3 h. 8-μl aliquots were spotted onto DEAE-81 filter paper (Whatman) and washed with 20 mm sodium formate, pH 8.0 to remove any remaining S-adenosylmethionine. The experiment without ribavirin 5′-triphosphate served as a reference. Radioactively labeled RNA was quantified by liquid scintillation counting. Determination of RTP Dissociation Constant for NS5MTaseDV—The dissociation constant, Kd, was determined using 58 μm [32P]GTP and increasing concentrations of RTP (0, 100, 200, 500, 800, and 1000 μm) incubated with 2 μg of NS5MTaseDV. The bound radioactivity was quantitated after SDS-PAGE using photostimulatable plates and a FujiImager. Data were fit to a hyperbolic function from which the Kd was determined. GTP-binding Inhibition by RTP and Its Analogues—Two μg of NS5MTaseDV was incubated with RTP or RTP analogues and with [32P]GTP (50 μm, 10% volume of [32P]GTP) in 50 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 5 mm dithiothreitol, and 5 mm MgCl2. The reaction mixture was irradiated with UV light for 3 min using a UV lamp (40 watts, at 254 nm) at a distance of 12 mm, boiled for 5 min, and subjected to denaturing gel electrophoresis. The gel was stained using Coomassie Blue dye, and radioactive products were visualized using photostimulatable plates and a FujiImager. Structure Determination and Refinement—Crystals of NS5MTaseDV were grown by vapor diffusion as described (12Egloff M.P. Benarroch D. Selisko B. Romette J.L. Canard B. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 2757-2768Crossref PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar) and further soaked for 3 h in 2 mm RTP. A 2.6-Å data set was collected at 100 K using a charge-coupled device detector (ADSC Q4) at ID14-2 beamline, ESRF, Grenoble, France. Data were processed using DENZO (14Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38526) Google Scholar), and intensities were merged with SCALA (15P4 CC Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19748) Google Scholar). Since the unit cell dimensions of the crystal were slightly different from those of the apo-form, the structure was solved by the molecular replacement program AmoRe, whereas polypeptide chain of the apo-form served as a model (PDB code 1L9K). A random set comprising 5% of the data was omitted from refinement for Rfree calculation (16Brünger A.T. Nature. 1992; 355: 472-474Crossref PubMed Scopus (3860) Google Scholar). A round of simulated annealing refinement, as implemented using crystallography CNS software, was performed (17Brünger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16957) Google Scholar). As in the case of the apo-form, no density was observed for the first 6 and the last 30 residues. Models for one molecule of S-adenosyl-l-homocysteine (SAHC) and one molecule of ribavirin 5′-monophosphate were built into the Fo – Fc and 2Fo – Fc SIGMAA-weighted electron density. The model was further built and refined through alternating cycles using the programs TURBO-FRODO (18Roussel A. Cambillau C. Silicon Graphics Directory. Mountain View, CA1991: 97Google Scholar) and CNS (crystallography NMR software), respectively. During this process seven sulfate ions, which were already present in the native structure, and 66 additional water molecules were refined. Refinement statistics are given in Table I.

Open table in a new tab Inhibition of the RNA 2′-O-Methyltransferase Activity of Dengue Virus NS5MTaseDV Domain—The NS5MTaseDV domain is able to bind GTP (12Egloff M.P. Benarroch D. Selisko B. Romette J.L. Canard B. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 2757-2768Crossref PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar). In addition, the crystal structure of a ternary complex consisting of NS5MTaseDV, SAHC, and GTP has been described previously (12Egloff M.P. Benarroch D. Selisko B. Romette J.L. Canard B. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 2757-2768Crossref PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar). In this complex, GTP mimics an RNA cap. Since NS5MTaseDV acts as an RNA 2′-O-methyltransferase (12Egloff M.P. Benarroch D. Selisko B. Romette J.L. Canard B. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 2757-2768Crossref PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar), we tested whether RTP could have a direct effect on this activity. Since ribavirin is a guanosine analogue and a weak inhibitor of flavivirus growth (7Neyts J. Meerbach A. McKenna P. De Clercq E. Antiviral Res. 1996; 30: 125-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 8Jordan I. Briese T. Fischer N. Lau J.Y. Lipkin W.I. J. Infect. Dis. 2000; 182: 1214-1217Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar, 9Crance J.M. Scaramozzino N. Jouan A. Garin D.

Antiviral Res. 1982; 2: 69-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 20Leyssen P. Van Lommel A. Drosten C. Schmitz H. De Clercq E. Neyts J. Virology. 2001; 279: 27-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), the NS5MTaseDV domain may be a target for RTP. In the RNA 2′-O-methyltransferase assay, a short capped RNA is incubated with NS5MTaseDV, the radiolabeled methyl donor S-adenosyl-l-methionine, and various concentrations of RTP. The methylated RNA product is monitored over time using a filter paper binding assay (12Egloff M.P. Benarroch D. Selisko B. Romette J.L. Canard B. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 2757-2768Crossref PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar). Fig. 1A shows the results of such an inhibition assay. RTP inhibits the RNA 2′-O-methyl-transferase activity. Under the experimental conditions tested here, the inhibitory concentration required to yield a 50% inhibition (IC50) is 101 ± 20 μm, leading to the conclusion that RTP is indeed an inhibitor of the RNA 2′-O-methyltransferase activity contained in the NS5MTaseDV domain. Mapping of the Guanosine Analogue Binding Site to the Dengue Virus NS5MTaseDV Domain—The crystal structure of NS5MTaseDV (12Egloff M.P. Benarroch D. Selisko B. Romette J.L. Canard B. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 2757-2768Crossref PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar) indicates that this domain has two nucleoside/nucleotide binding pockets (i.e. one for SAHC and the other for GTP), which could account for the binding of RTP and subsequent inhibition of the RNA 2′-O-methyltransferase activity. Since RTP is a GTP analogue, a GTP-binding competition experiment was used to map the RTP binding site. When the protein is incubated with a fixed concentration of radiolabeled GTP and increasing concentrations of RTP, GTP binding is decreased (Fig. 1B). This indicates that RTP displaces GTP from NS5MTaseDV. When the relative inhibition is plotted against RTP concentration, an apparent Kd value of 55 ± 9 μm is calculated. RTP exhibits a NS5MTaseDV binding affinity similar to that of GTP (Kd = 58 ± 14 μm (12Egloff M.P. Benarroch D. Selisko B. Romette J.L. Canard B. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 2757-2768Crossref PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar)). We then tested the binding of other analogues to NS5MTaseDV. Acyclovir 5′-triphosphate is a guanosine analogue with an acyclic backbone replacing the ribose, and EICAR 5′-triphosphate is a 5-deaza 5-ethynyl ribavirin 5′-triphosphate. Both analogues bound to NS5MTaseDV with Kd values of 80 ± 7 and 165 ± 7 μm, respectively (Fig. 1C). Finding that RTP has the best affinity of the three guanosine analogues and that the acyclic moiety of acyclovir 5′-TP is seemingly less important for binding than a modified base such as that of EICAR prompted us to assay other RTP analogues modified on their ribose moiety (6Gallois-Montbrun S. Chen Y. Dutartre H. Sophys M. Morera S. Guerreiro C. Schneider B. Mulard L. Janin J. Veron M. Deville-Bonne D. Canard B. Mol. Pharmacol. 2003; 63: 538-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). A series of preliminary experiments was performed to determine whether any of these analogues would bind better to NS5MTaseDV than RTP. Fig. 2 shows the result of such experiments in which 2′-deoxy-, 2′,3′-dideoxy-, 3′-deoxy-, 2′,3′-epoxy-, and 2′3′-dideoxy-2′3′-didehydro-RTP were used to compete for GTP binding. None of these analogues exhibits a better affinity for NS5MTaseDV than RTP. 3′-deoxy-RTP binds almost as efficiently as RTP, whereas 2′3′-dideoxy-RTP binds with the lowest relative affinity. We conclude that RTP and GTP compete for the NS5MTaseDV binding site, and the structural basis for this competition was further investigated using x-ray crystallography. Structural Basis for the Binding of RTP to the Dengue Virus NS5MTaseDV Domain and for Its Inhibition—A crystal of NS5MTaseDV was soaked for 3 h in 2 mm RTP under the conditions described previously (12Egloff M.P. Benarroch D. Selisko B. Romette J.L. Canard B. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 2757-2768Crossref PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar). The structure was solved using molecular replacement techniques and revealed that (i) an RTP molecule was bound to the enzyme, and (ii) the RTP molecule was located at the previously identified GTP binding site. As for the GTP analogue GDPMP, the β- and γ-phosphates of RTP were present but not well defined in the electron density maps and were therefore not modeled. The α-phosphate and the ribose moiety of RTP make contact with NS5MTaseDV in a manner similar to the GTP analogue (Fig. 3, A and B). However, interesting features are revealed when comparing the respective nucleo- or pseudobase orientation and the positioning of both compounds. The structural resemblance of ribavirin with guanosine originates from the spatial position of both the 1- and 6-position (Fig. 3, C and D). However in the NS5MTaseDV-GTP analogue complex, neither of these positions interacts with the protein, and the NH2 group located at the 2-position makes the only specific interactions of the nucleobase with the protein (12Egloff M.P. Benarroch D. Selisko B. Romette J.L. Canard B. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 2757-2768Crossref PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar). The complex formation of NS5MTaseDV with either the GTP analogue or RTP does not result in any conformational change of the protein. When superimposing the protein atoms of both complexes, it becomes obvious that ribavirin mimics the interaction established by the NH2 group of the 2-position of guanine by a 30° rotation around an axis perpendicular to the nucleobase plane and passing through the C-1 position of the ribose (Fig. 3E). As a result, the NH2 group of ribavirin is nearly superimposed (0.38 Å away) with the NH2 group of the guanine and is therefore recognized in a similar fashion; the carbonyl group of RTP does not interact with any residue, and the NH2 group forms a hydrogen bond to the same carbonyl groups of Leu-17, Asn-18, and Leu-20 as the 2-amino group of GDPMP. Thus, RTP makes the same atomic contacts as GTP, and this result is in agreement with the finding that RTP and GTP exhibit similar affinity constants (Fig. 1). We conclude that RTP is a moderate inhibitor of the RNA 2′-O-methyltransferase activity carried by the NS5MTaseDV domain. In light of our mapping and structural data, RTP acts as a GTP or RNA cap analogue, binds to the RNA cap binding site of the NS5MTaseDV domain, and impedes RNA cap 2′-O-methylation. In this paper, we have show that RTP inhibits the RNA 2′-O-methyltransferase activity of dengue virus NS5MTaseDV domain. We further mapped the binding site of RTP binding to the GTP/RNA cap binding site using GTP competition experiments. The RTP binding site was then characterized at the atomic level using x-ray crystallography at 2.6 Å resolution. The structure presented here is the first example of a viral enzyme complexed to a ribavirin nucleotide. Two cellular protein structures have been solved in complex with ribavirin nucleotides: the H122G mutant of nucleoside diphosphate kinase from Dyctyostelium discoideum (PDB code 1MN9 (6Gallois-Montbrun S. Chen Y. Dutartre H. Sophys M. Morera S. Guerreiro C. Schneider B. Mulard L. Janin J. Veron M. Deville-Bonne D. Canard B. Mol. Pharmacol. 2003; 63: 538-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar)) and the inosine-5′-monophosphate dehydrogenase from Tritrichomonas foetus (PDB code 1ME8 (5Prosise G.L. Wu J.Z. Luecke H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 50654-50659Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar)). In the former complex, the binding of RTP is completely aspecific; the phosphate and ribose of RTP interact via hydrogen bonding with the protein, but the only ribavirin pseudobase-protein interaction is an aromatic stacking involving Phe-64, which could be achieved by any nucleobase (Fig. 3, B and E). The atomic contacts are different in the complex of RMP with inosine-5′-monophosphate dehydrogenase, as the ribavirin pseudobase establishes three hydrogen bonds with the protein (Fig. 3F). In the ternary complex with coenzyme A (PDB code 1ME7), no structural rearrangements take place, as the CoA binds in a preformed binding site and the interactions of ribavirin with the protein are not modified. However, a comparison of the relative position of RMP and IMP in complex with inosine 5′-monophosphate dehydrogenase reveals that ribavirin superimposes with IMP perfectly, contrary to what is observed in the NS5MTaseDV-RTP complex. This is because of the intrinsic nature of both nucleotides; with IMP, the NH2 group of ribavirin could have been mimicked by the NH group in the 1-position, whereas with GMP, either the 1- or the 2-position could have been mimicked by the NH2 group of ribavirin. It is not known whether ribavirin targets NS5MTaseDV in flavivirus-infected cells. It has been demonstrated that ribavirin significantly reduces the growth of several flaviviruses, with no information about the actual viral target (7Neyts J. Meerbach A. McKenna P. De Clercq E. Antiviral Res. 1996; 30: 125-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 8Jordan I. Briese T. Fischer N. Lau J.Y. Lipkin W.I. J. Infect.

Virology. 2001; 279: 27-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). In the case of dengue serotypes 1, 2, and 3, West Nile, and yellow fever viruses, the reported IC50 values are between 81 and 171 μm (7Neyts J. Meerbach A. McKenna P. De Clercq E. Antiviral Res. 1996; 30: 125-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 9Crance J.M. Scaramozzino N. Jouan A. Garin D.

Virology. 2001; 279: 27-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The apparent inhibition parameters observed in this report for RTP (IC50 ∼100 μm) are in good agreement with these IC50 values. Because ribavirin decreases the intracellular GTP concentration drastically, it potentiates the successful competition of RTP against GTP for NS5MTaseDV binding. Indeed, the average intracellular GTP concentrations in various mammalian cell types have been measured and found to be ∼0.48 mm (compiled in Ref. 21Kornberg A. Baker T. DNA Replication. 2nd Ed. W. H. Freeman, New York1992: 54Google Scholar). Treatment of murine leukemia L1210 cells with 20 μm ribavirin decreases the GTP concentration to a value equal to 12% of that of the untreated control, i.e. around 60 μm (22Balzarini J. Karlsson A. Wang L. Bohman C. Horska K. Votruba I. Fridland A. Van Aerschot A. Herdewijn P. De Clercq E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24591-24598Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This latter value is precisely the same as that of the KD (GTP) for NS5MTaseDV (58 ± 14 μm (12Egloff M.P. Benarroch D. Selisko B. Romette J.L. Canard B. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 2757-2768Crossref PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar)). This observation suggests that with ribavirin treatment, which involves ribavirin concentrations of 600–800 μm in biological fluids (23Gilbert B.E. Knight V. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1986; 30: 201-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar), the down-regulated GTP concentration is not likely to saturate NS5MTaseDV, leaving open the possibility that the binding of RTP to NS5MTaseDV may be relevant to the known ribavirin anti-lavivirus activity. This discussion may also be relevant to other viruses. Indeed, RTP has been reported to be an inhibitor of the (guanine-N7)-methyltransferase of vaccinia virus, as well as to lead to abnormal RNA cap formation in alphaviruses (reviewed in Ref. 24Bisaillon M. Lemay G. Virology. 1997; 236: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). To date, there is little evidence that ribavirin actually targets viral enzymes other than RNA polymerases, as in the case of hepaciviruses (3Hong Z. Cameron C.E. Prog. Drug Res. 2002; 59: 41-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 25Young K.C. Lindsay K.L. Lee K.J. Liu W.C. He J.W. Milstein S.L. Lai M.M. Hepatology. 2003; 38: 869-878Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). The structural data presented here suggest a model for the inhibition of the RNA 2′-O-methyltransferase activity by RTP. RTP may compete with viral RNA cap structures to bind the NS5MTaseDv and prevent efficient RNA cap methylation. Whether or not RTP causes flavivirus growth inhibition through the targeting of NS5MTaseDVin vivo, our results still have implications in terms of drug design. First, screening of the Protein Data Bank revealed that no specific recognition of GTP with only the purine 2-position (as shown in Fig. 3, B and D) has been reported before that of NS5MTaseDV (12Egloff M.P. Benarroch D. Selisko B. Romette J.L. Canard B. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 2757-2768Crossref PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar). The great majority of cellular NTP-binding enzymes appear to contact at least two of the purine at position 1, 2, or 6 (12Egloff M.P. Benarroch D. Selisko B. Romette J.L. Canard B. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 2757-2768Crossref PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar). Among over 60 protein-GTP or protein-RNA cap complexes examined, only two (PDB codes 1KHB and 1DOA) bind GTP using a single position (O-6 in this case) in addition to base-stacking contacts. In theory, since RTP and GTP have equivalent H-bond donors and acceptors at positions 1 and 6 but not position 2, RTP could bind to GTP-binding proteins using positions 1 and 6. To the best of our knowledge, there is no example of such binding in the Protein Data Bank involving a protein of human origin. The observation of an antiviral selectivity for ribavirin may indicate that ribavirin either targets viral proteins through this position 2 alone (amine of RTP) or binds both viral and cellular GTP-binding proteins through positions 1 and 6 (carbonyl and the NH of RTP) but has a more profound effect on viral targets, hence the observed selectivity. Second, the same series of RTP analogues has been used to inhibit HCV NS5B, a hepacivirus RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (6Gallois-Montbrun S. Chen Y. Dutartre H. Sophys M. Morera S. Guerreiro C. Schneider B. Mulard L. Janin J. Veron M. Deville-Bonne D. Canard B. Mol. Pharmacol. 2003; 63: 538-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Hepaciviruses do not have an RNA capping machinery, but their RNA-dependent RNA polymerase domain is ∼10% identical (22% amino acid similarity) to that of flaviviruses. We note that the most important ribose groups for binding/inhibition are not similar between the hepatitis C virus NS5B polymerase and NS5MTaseDV. For hepatitis C virus NS5B the 3′-hydroxyl is critical (6Gallois-Montbrun S. Chen Y. Dutartre H. Sophys M. Morera S. Guerreiro C. Schneider B. Mulard L. Janin J. Veron M. Deville-Bonne D. Canard B. Mol. Pharmacol. 2003; 63: 538-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), whereas our present results indicate that the 2′-hydroxyl is most important in the case of NS5MTaseDV. Therefore, if the most important group is also the 3′-hydroxyl for the flavivirus RNA polymerase, it seems difficult to design a simple ribose modification that would target both the RNA polymerase and the cap-binding enzyme of flaviviruses simultaneously. Third, only main-chain contacts are involved in the binding of RTP to NS5MTaseDV. A mere substitution of an amino acid side chain cannot directly discriminate RTP relative to GTP in order to provide potential drug resistance. Since RNA capping is essential for various viruses (18Roussel A. Cambillau C. Silicon Graphics Directory. Mountain View, CA1991: 97Google Scholar), the mechanism for ribavirin-mediated inhibition of RNA capping presented here may account in part for the antiviral activity of ribavirin against flaviviruses, but it does not exclude the inhibition of additional viral enzymatic activities. Our results would then provide a basis for rational drug design against human pathogens of viral origin, of which the emerging flaviviruses are a timely example.

(2003) J. Biol. Chem. 278, 21058–21069). Here, we have examined the mechanism of action of menin in regulating osteoblast differentiation using the mouse bone marrow stromal ST2 and osteoblast MC3T3-E1 cell lines. In ST2 cells, reduced menin expression achieved by transfection of menin antisense DNA (AS) antagonized bone morphogenetic protein (BMP)-2-induced alkaline phosphatase activity and osteocalcin and Runx2 mRNA expression. Menin was co-immunoprecipitated with Smad1/5 in ST2 and MC3T3-E1 cells, and inactivation of menin antagonized BMP-2-induced transcriptional activity of Smad1/5 in ST2 cells, but not MC3T3-E1 cells. Menin was co-immunoprecipitated with the key osteoblast regulator, Runx2, and AS antagonized Runx2 transcriptional activity and the ability of Runx2 to stimulate alkaline phosphatase activity only in ST2 cells but not in MC3T3-E1 cells. In the osteoblast MC3T3-E1 cells, transforming growth factor-β and its signaling molecule, Smad3, negatively regulated Runx2 transcriptional activity. Menin and Smad3 were co-immunoprecipitated, and combined menin and Smad3 overexpression antagonized, whereas menin and the dominant-negative Smad3ΔC together enhanced BMP-2-induced transcriptional activity of Smad1/5 and Runx2. Smad3 alone had no effect. Therefore, menin interacts physically and functionally with Runx2 in uncommitted mesenchymal stem cells, but not in well differentiated osteoblasts. In osteoblasts the interaction of menin and the transforming growth factor-β/Smad3 pathway negatively regulates the BMP-2/Smad1/5- and Runx2-induced transcriptional activities leading to inhibition of late-stage differentiation. Menin, the product of the multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN1) gene, is required for commitment of multipotential mesenchymal stem cells to the osteoblast lineage, however, it inhibits their later differentiation (Sowa, H., Kaji, H., Canaff, L., Hendy, G.N., Tsukamoto, T., Yamaguchi, T., Miyazono, K., Sugimoto, T., and Chihara, K.

Bone modeling and remodeling are essential for development, maturation, maintenance, and repair of bones. During bone modeling and remodeling, multipotential mesenchymal stem cells, derived from mesoderm, become osteoprogenitors and commit to the osteoblast lineage. Thereafter, the cells undergo further differentiation, exhibiting osteoblast-specific phenotypes, such as the expression of type I collagen, alkaline phosphatase (ALP), 1The abbreviations used are: ALP, alkaline phosphatase; OCN, osteocalcin; TGF-β, transforming growth factor type β; BMP, bone morphogenetic protein; AS, menin antisense; FBS, fetal bovine serum; RT, reverse transcriptase. and osteocalcin (OCN). Along with this maturation process of osteoblasts, extracellular matrix is mineralized or calcified and bone is formed. These sequential events are regulated by several hormones, growth factors, and cytokines. The intracellular signaling pathways triggered by these factors cross-talk to each other, forming a complex network system. The output of these signaling pathways drives the activities of transcriptional factors, such as Runx2 (1McCabe L.R. Kockx M. Lian J. Stein J. Stein G. Exp.

Consequently, lack of both MEN1 gene alleles leads to tumor development consistent with the 610-amino acid protein product, menin, acting as a tumor suppressor. Mice with heterozygous menin inactivation exhibit a phenotype similar to that of the human disorder and endocrine tumors develop later in life (13Bertolino P. Tong W.M. Galendo D. Wang Z.Q.

Because cranial bones are formed by intramembranous ossification, these findings suggested that menin might play an important role in the commitment of multipotential mesenchymal stem cells into the osteoblast lineage and osteoblast differentiation. Transforming growth factor (TGF)-β superfamily members play a central role in a broad range of cellular responses including growth and differentiation. Within this superfamily, bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) and TGF-β are critical regulators of bone formation. BMPs were originally identified as molecules that induce ectopic bone and cartilage formation in the rat (27Wang E.A. Rosen V. Cordes P. Hewick R.M. Kriz M.J. Luxenberg D.P. Sibley B.S. Wozney J.M.

BMPs induce the commitment of mesenchymal cells into osteo/chondrocyte progenitors and regulate growth and differentiation of these osteoblast and chondrocyte lineage cells (30Wang E.A. Israel D.I.

Endocrinology. 1990; 126: 1014-1021Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) where it is stored in an inactive form and upon release, it is activated in the bone microenvironment (34Centrella M. Horowitz M.C. Wozney J.M. McCarthy T.L. Endocr. Rev. 1994; 15: 27-39PubMed Google Scholar). Whereas TGF-β may provide competence for early stage osteoblastic differentiation, it inhibits late-stage osteoblast differentiation (35Roelen B.A. ten Dijke P. J. Orthop. Sci. 2003; 8: 740-748Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). BMPs and TGF-β act through a cell-surface complex of type I and type II transmembrane serine/threonine kinase receptors. In the presence of ligand, the receptors associate and the type II receptor phosphorylates the type I receptor, which propagates a signal by phosphorylating receptor-regulated Smads (R-Smads) at their carboxyl termini and activating them (36Shi Y. Massague J. Cell. 2003; 113: 685-700Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4867) Google Scholar, 37Massague J. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 1: 169-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (1658) Google Scholar). BMP receptors activate Smad1, -5, and -8, and TGF-β receptors activate Smad2 and -3. Activated Smads form stable complexes with the common Smad (C-Smad), Smad4, and the complex translocates to the nucleus and regulates transcriptional responses initiated by BMP or TGF-β.

Haploinsufficiency of the RUNX2 gene in humans leads to cleidocranial dysplasia with delayed closure of sutures, small or absent clavicles, tooth anomalies, and short stature.

Runx2 is a common target of BMP-2 and TGF-β, and cooperation between Runx2 and Smad5 induces osteoblast-specific gene expression in the mesenchymal C2C12 cell line (38Lee K.S. Kim H.J. Li Q.L.

However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the actions of menin in this regard are not known. In the present study, we have examined the interactions of menin with BMP-2 and TGF-β signaling molecules, the Smads, and the pivotal transcriptional regulator of osteogenesis, Runx2, in both a multipotential mesenchymal cell line and an osteoblast cell line. Materials—Human recombinant BMP-2 was kindly provided by Yamanouchi Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. (Tokyo, Japan). Human recombinant TGF-β1, anti-myc mouse monoclonal antibody, and anti-FLAG mouse monoclonal antibody were from Sigma, and anti-Runx2 goat polyclonal antibody was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). The menin rabbit polyclonal antibody was raised against a decapentapeptide (synthesized by solid-phase chemistry at the Peptide Synthesis Facility of the Sheldon Biotechnology Centre of McGill University) corresponding to amino acids 476–489 of menin (a sequence that is completely conserved between human and mouse) with an additional cysteine residue at the carboxyl terminus. The peptide was coupled through the cysteine residue to keyhole limpet hemocyanin. The antiserum was immunoaffinity purified before use, and, by Western blot of a variety of cell lines of different species, shown to recognize human and rodent menin with similar affinity (16Kaji H. Canaff L. Goltzman D. Hendy G.N. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 5097-5101PubMed Google Scholar). Cell Culture—Mouse bone marrow ST2 and osteoblastic MC3T3-E1 cell lines were cultured in α-minimal essential medium (containing 50 μg/ml ascorbic acid) supplemented with 10% FBS and 1% penicillin-streptomycin (Invitrogen). The medium was changed twice a week. Construction of Expression Plasmids and Stable Transfection—For the antisense menin construct, human menin cDNA was cloned in an antisense orientation into the EcoRI site of pcDNA 3.1(+). Antisense menin cDNA (AS) or empty vector (V) (each 3 μg) were transfected into ST2 cells with LipofectAMINE (Invitrogen). Six hours after transfection, the cells were fed with fresh α-minimal essential medium containing 10% FBS. Reduced expression of menin by AS was detected with immunoblot analysis using the polyclonal anti-menin antibody. To rule out the possibility of clonal variation, we characterized at least three independent clones for each transfection. V-transfected cells were used as the control. Construction of Expression Plasmids and Transient Transfection— The human menin cDNA, the myc-tagged Smad3 and FLAG-tagged Smad1/Smad5 vectors were prepared as previously described (22Sowa H. Kaji H.

A mutant form of myc-tagged Smad3 (Smad3ΔC), in which the MH2 domain corresponding to amino acid residues 278–425 was removed (39Lebrun J.J. Takabe K. Chen Y. Vale W. Mol.

These constructs or empty vector (V) (each 3 μg) were transfected into ST2 and MC3T3-E1 cells with LipofectAMINE (Invitrogen). Six h later, the cells were fed with fresh medium containing 10% FBS. Forty-eight h later, the transfected cells were harvested for the experiments. Luciferase Assay—Cells were seeded at a density of 2 × 105 per 6-well plate. Twenty-four h later, cells were transfected with 3 μgofthe reporter plasmid (3GC2 lux, OSC-luci or 3TP-Lux) with the pCH110 plasmid expressing β-galactosidase (1 μg) in each well, using LipofectAMINE (Invitrogen), as described (21Kaji H.

Fifteen h later, the medium was changed to one containing 4% FBS, and the cells were incubated for an additional 9 h. Thereafter, cells were cultured for 24 h in the presence or absence of 100 ng/ml BMP-2 or 5 ng/ml TGF-β in medium containing 0.2% FBS. Cells were lysed, the luciferase activity was measured, and normalized to the relative β-galactosidase activity as described (21Kaji H. Canaff L. Lebrun J.J. Goltzman D. Hendy G.N. Proc. Natl. Acad.

Protein Extraction and Western Blot Analysis—Cells were lysed with radioimmunoprecipitation buffer containing 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, complete protease inhibitor mixture, 1% Triton X-100, and 1 mm sodium orthovanadate. Cell lysates were centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C, and the supernatants were stored at –80 °C. Protein quantitation was performed with BCA protein assay reagent (Pierce). Twenty μg of protein were denatured in SDS sample buffer and separated on 10% polyacrylamide-SDS gels. Proteins were transferred in 25 mm Tris, 192 mm glycine, and 20% methanol to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. Blots were blocked with Tris-buffered saline (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) and 137 mm NaCl) plus 0.1% Tween 20 containing 3% dried milk powder. The antigen-antibody complexes were visualized using the appropriate secondary antibodies (Sigma), and the enhanced chemiluminescence detection system as recommended by the manufacturer (Amersham Biosciences). For co-immunoprecipitation experiments, cells were lysed with a buffer containing 1% Triton X-100, 1% deoxycholate, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 25 mm sodium fluoride, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 2 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 2 mm EGTA, plus protease inhibitor mixture for 30 min at 4 °C, and insoluble materials were separated by centrifugation at 4 °C for 30 min at 14,000 × g. An aliquot of the supernatant containing 1 mg of protein was clarified and incubated with anti-FLAG antibody (Sigma) on a rocking platform at 4 °C overnight. The immune complexes were collected with Protein G Plus/Protein A-agarose beads (Calbiochem) for 30 min at 4 °C. The beads were washed three times with lysis buffer, resuspended in 2× sample buffer, and boiled for 5 min. Immunoprecipitated proteins were then analyzed by SDS-PAGE and subjected to Western blot analysis using anti-myc antibody (Sigma) as described above. Subcellular Fractionation—Cultures were trypsinized, and the cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and collected by centrifugation (16Kaji H. Canaff L. Goltzman D. Hendy G.N.

Cells were gently resuspended in 2 ml of buffer containing 5 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 20 mm HEPES, 10 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.5% aprotinin, and 0.5% leupeptin, allowed to swell for 10 min, processed by 20 strokes in a Dounce tissue homogenizer, and centrifuged at 2,000 × g for 10 min. After decanting the supernatants, the pellets were resuspended in 1 ml of radioimmunoprecipitation buffer (150 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1% deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 0.5% aprotinin, and 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), briefly sonicated, and nuclear pellets were obtained by centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C, resuspended in 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 25% glycerol, 0.42 m NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, and again Dounce homogenized. After a 20-min centrifugation at 15,000 × g, supernatants were dialyzed for 5 h against 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 20% glycerol, 0.1 m KCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 0.5 mm dithiothreitol. Protein quantitation and Western blot analyses were performed as described above. RNA Extraction and Semi-quantitative Reverse Transcriptase-Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR)—Total RNA was prepared from cells using the acid guanidinium-thiocyanate-phenol-chloroform extraction method. Reverse transcription of 5-μg aliquots of RNA was carried out for 50 min at 42 °C and then 15 min at 70 °C, using the Super Script First Strand Synthesis System for RT-PCR (Invitrogen), which contains RT buffer, oligo(dT)12–18, 5× First Strand Solution, 10 mm dNTP, 0.1 m dithiothreitol, Super Script II (RT-enzyme), and RNase inhibitor. PCR using primers to unique sequences in each cDNA was carried out in a volume of 10 μl of reaction mixture for PCR (as supplied by TaKaRa, Otsu, Japan), supplemented with 2.5 units of TaKaRa Taq, 1.5 mm of each dNTP (Takara), and PCR buffer (×10), which contained 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.3, 500 mm KCl, and 15 mm MgCl2. Twenty-five ng of each primer and 1 μl of template (from a 50 μl of RT reaction) were used. Thermal cycling conditions and primer sequences were as follows: 1) initial denaturation at 96 °C for 2 min; 2) cycling for a cDNA-specific number of cycles; 96 °C for 1 min, cDNA-specific annealing temperature for 2 min, and 72 °C for 2 min; and 3) final extension at 72 °C for 5 min. Primer sequences, annealing temperature, and cycle numbers were as follows: Runx2, 5′-CAGGAAGACTGCAAGAAGGCTCTGG-3′ and 5′-ACACGGTGTCACTGCGCTGAAGA-3′ (62 °C; 25 cycles); OCN, 5′-CTCTGTCTCTCTGACCTCACAG-3′ and 5′-GGAGCTGCTGTGACATCCATAC-3′ (53 °C; 28 cycles), and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; 5′-ATCCCATCACCATCTTCCAGGAG-3′ and 5′-CCTGCTTCACCACCTTCTTGATG-3′ (58 °C; 22 cycles). For semi-quantitative RT-PCR, the number of cycles was chosen so that amplification remained well within the linear range as assessed by densitometry (NIH Image J, version 1.08i, public domain program). An equal volume from each PCR was analyzed by 6% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and ethidium bromide-stained PCR products were evaluated. Marker gene expression was normalized to glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase expression in each sample. ALP Assay—ALP activity was assayed as described (22Sowa H. Kaji H. Canaff L. Hendy G.N.

In brief, the assay mixtures contained 0.1 m 2-amino-2-methyl-1-propanol (Sigma), 1 mm MgCl2, 8 mmp-nitrophenyl phosphate disodium, and cell homogenates. After 3 min incubation at 37 °C, the reaction was stopped with 0.1 n NaOH and the absorbance was read at 405 nm. A standard curve was prepared with p-nitrophenol (Sigma). Each value was normalized to the protein concentration. Statistics—Data are expressed as mean ± S.E. Statistical analysis was performed using an unpaired t test or analysis o"
https://openalex.org/W1987490683,"The serine protease urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA) interacts with a specific receptor (uPAR) on the surface of various cell types, including tumor cells, and plays a crucial role in pericellular proteolysis. High levels of uPA and uPAR often correlate with poor prognosis of cancer patients. Therefore, the specific inhibition of uPA with small molecule active-site inhibitors is one strategy to decrease the invasive and metastatic activity of tumor cells. We have developed a series of highly potent and selective uPA inhibitors with a C-terminal 4-amidinobenzylamide residue. Optimization was directed toward reducing the fast elimination from circulation that was observed with initial analogues. The x-ray structures of three inhibitor/uPA complexes have been solved and were used to improve the inhibition efficacy. One of the most potent and selective derivatives, benzylsulfonyl-d-Ser-Ser-4-amidinobenzylamide (inhibitor 26), inhibits uPA with a Ki of 20 nm. This inhibitor was used in a fibrosarcoma model in nude mice using lacZ-tagged human HT1080 cells, to prevent experimental lung metastasis formation. Compared with control (100%), an inhibitor dose of 2 × 1.5 mg/kg/day reduced the number of experimental metastases to 4.6 ± 1%. Under these conditions inhibitor 26 also significantly prolonged survival. All mice from the control group died within 43 days after tumor cell inoculation, whereas 50% of mice from the inhibitor-treated group survived more than 117 days.

This study demonstrates that the specific inhibition of uPA by these inhibitors may be a useful strategy for the treatment of cancer to prevent metastasis. The detachment of malignant cells from the primary tumor and their subsequent migration within the surrounding tissue, including intravasation and extravasation into blood and lymph vessels, leads to tumor dissemination and the formation of metastases at distant loci. Whereas a solid tumor can be removed by surgery or treated by radio-, chemo-, or hormone therapy, invasive tumor cells that have spread over the whole body can form secondary tumors leading to poor prognosis or death of cancer patients. Several proteases, such as matrix metalloproteases, the cysteine proteases cathepsin B and L, the aspartyl protease cathepsin D, and serine proteases, e.g. plasmin and uPA, 1The abbreviations used are: uPA, urokinase-type plasminogen activator; 4-Amba, 4-amidinobenzylamide; Bzls, benzylsulfonyl; Dap, α,β-diaminopropionic acid; t.c.i., tumor cell inoculation; tPA, tissue-type plasminogen activator; uPAR, urokinase-type plasminogen activator receptor; X-gal, 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-galactopyranoside; DIEA, N,N-diisopropylethylamine; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography; HMW, high molecular weight; LMW, low molecular weight. are involved at multiple stages during growth, invasion and progression of tumors, including metastases formation (1Mignatti P. Rifkin D.B. Physiol. Rev. 1993; 73: 161-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (1180) Google Scholar). High levels of expression of these proteases often correlate with poor prognosis for cancer patients (2Reuning U. Magdolen V. Wilhelm O. Fischer K. Lutz V. Graeff H. Schmitt M. Int. J. Oncol. 1998; 13: 893-906PubMed Google Scholar). However, in several clinical cancer trials with different types of nonspecific matrix metalloprotease inhibitors, disappointing results with poor benefit and severe side effects were observed (3Coussens L.M. Fingleton B. Matrisian L.M. Science. 2002; 295: 2387-2392Crossref PubMed Scopus (2376) Google Scholar). This stimulated the search for alternative proteases with matrix degrading activity as new targets for anti-cancer drugs. An important role in metastasis has been recently ascribed to the plasmin-plasminogen activation system and especially to uPA. Both, uPA and the second endogenous plasminogen activator tPA are trypsin-like serine proteases that can activate plasminogen into enzymatically active plasmin, a broad spectrum serine protease. Whereas the main biological function of tPA seems to be associated with fibrinolysis, uPA is a central molecule in pericellular proteolysis (4Collen D. Hematology. 2001; : 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). uPA is produced by a variety of cells as an single chain pro-uPA that binds to a specific receptor (uPAR) on the surface of tumor cells. This is in contrast to tPA for which no cell surface receptor is known. ProuPA bound to its receptor is converted into enzymatically active uPA mainly by plasmin. Some other proteases, such as cathepsins B and L, plasma kallikrein, and the transmembrane serine protease matriptase, may also be involved in uPA activation (5Schmitt M. Wilhelm O.G. Reuning U. Krüger A. Harbeck N. Lengyel E. Graeff H. Gänsbacher B. Kessler H. Bürgle M. Stürzebecher J. Sperl S. Magdolen V. Fibrinol.

Chem. 2000; 275: 36720-36725Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar). This cell surface focused active uPA, in turn, catalyzes plasminogen activation more efficiently than fluid-phase uPA (7Andreasen P.A. Eglund R. Petersen H.H. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2000; 57: 25-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (838) Google Scholar). The generated plasmin can then activate proforms of several matrix metalloproteases, as well as activate additional pro-uPA. Several studies have established that uPA and uPAR levels are elevated in cancer patients making them diagnostic markers and attractive targets for anti-cancer drugs (8Duffy M.J. Clin. Cancer Res. 1996; 2: 613-618PubMed Google Scholar, 9Sier C.F. Stephens R. Bizik J. Mariani A. Bassan M. Pedersen N. Frigerio L. Ferrari A. Dano K. Brunner N. Blasi F. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 1843-1849PubMed Google Scholar). There are several potential ways to influence the uPA/uPAR system. In addition to interference with the expression of these proteins by antisense oligonucleotides, it is also possible to block the ligation of uPA to its receptor by treatment with antibodies or competitive analogues (5Schmitt M. Wilhelm O.G. Reuning U. Krüger A. Harbeck N. Lengyel E. Graeff H. Gänsbacher B. Kessler H. Bürgle M. Stürzebecher J. Sperl S. Magdolen V. Fibrinol. Proteol. 2000; 14: 114-132Crossref Scopus (127) Google Scholar). A third strategy is the reduction of the proteolytic activity of the enzyme by treatment with synthetic, small molecule inhibitors. However, compared with other trypsin-like serine proteases, especially the clotting enzymes thrombin or factor Xa, only a few basic inhibitor structures are known, which selectively block uPA (10Rockway T.W. Nienhaber V. Giranda V.L. Curr. Pharm. Des. 2002; 8: 2541-2558Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 11Steinmetzer T. IDrugs. 2003; 6: 137-145Google Scholar, 12Rockway T.W. Expert Opin. Ther. Patents. 2003; 13: 773-786Crossref Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Clinical trials were recently initiated using 2,4,6-(triisopropyl)phenylsulfonyl-3-amidinophenylalanine-N′(ethyloxycarbonyl)-piperazide (13Stürzebecher J. Vieweg H. Steinmetzer T. Schweinitz A. Stubbs M. Renatus M. Wikström P. Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett. 1999; 9: 3147-3152Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). However, results with regard to the efficacy of this nonspecific protease inhibitor (Ki for uPA 0.41 μm) in cancer patients have not yet been published. Recently, we described the first analogues of a new series of tripeptide-derived uPA inhibitors containing an N-terminal Bzls-d-Ser moiety, an amino acid in the L-configuration as a P2 residue, and a C-terminal 4-amidinobenzylamide group in the P1 position (14Künzel S. Schweinitz A. Reißmann S. Stürzebecher J. Steinmetzer T. Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett. 2002; 12: 645-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). For one derivative from this series (Bzls-d-Ser-Ala-4-Amba) an x-ray structure in complex with uPA was recently published together with the structure of related uPA inhibitors containing a P1-arginal or P1-4-guanidinobenzyl-amide group (15Zeslawska E. Jacob U. Schweinitz A. Coombs G. Bode W. Madison E. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 328: 109-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). A pharmacokinetic analysis revealed that these first analogues were rapidly cleared from the blood of rats with a half-life shorter than 20 min after intravenous application because of a relatively fast hepatobiliary elimination. Although this limited their use in animal studies, we recently demonstrated a moderate efficacy of these first generation analogues on inhibition of liver metastases formation in a murine T-cell lymphoma model (16Banke I.J. Arlt M.J. Pennington C. Kopitz C. Steinmetzer T. Schweinitz A. Gansbacher B. Quigley J.P. Edwards D.R. Stürzebecher J. Krüger A. Biol. Chem. 2003; 384: 1515-1525Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). In this report we describe the results obtained from a systematic optimization of this inhibitor type. By modification of the P4 and/or P2 residues utilizing a strategy described for other types of benzamidine-derived serine protease inhibitors (17Hauptmann J. Steinmetzer T. Vieweg H. Wikström P. Stürzebecher J. Pharm. Res. 2002; 19: 1027-1033Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar, 18Rewinkel J.B.M. Adang A.E.P. Current Pharm. Des. 1999; 5: 1043-1075PubMed Google Scholar) we demonstrate that incorporation of additional charged or polar groups result in an increase in half-life of the inhibitors. Among the newly synthesized analogues, we could identify highly potent (Ki value ≤20 nm) and selective uPA inhibitors with prolonged half-life in the circulation of rats, which were useful for animal studies to demonstrate their efficacy as inhibitors for experimental metastases formation. The structures of three analogues with Gly, Ser, and Ser(Bzl) in the P2 position in complex with a human uPA variant was solved by x-ray crystallography, which provides a basis for their high affinity and selectivity as uPA inhibitors. The design of these uPA inhibitors, their pharmacokinetic properties, and use in an experimental tumor model are presented in this article. An inhibitor dose of 2 × 1.5 mg/kg/day of compound 26 (benzylsulfonyl-d-Ser-Ser-4-amidinobenzylamide, Ki 20 nm) significantly reduced the formation of experimental lung metastases in mice. These results support the hypothesis that uPA may be a potential target for the development of new anti-metastatic agents. Some of the substituted benzylsulfonylchlorides are commercially available (Maybridge, Cornwall, United Kingdom, or Array Biopharma, Boulder, CO), all other analogues were prepared from the appropriate sodium sulfonates by treatment with PCl5 in phosphorous chloride at 80 °C for 4-5 h. The reaction mixture was poured into ice water and vigorously stirred. Finally, the solidified sulfonylchloride was filtered, washed with water, and dried in vacuum. All of the used sodium sulfonates were obtained from the corresponding benzylbromides by refluxing with 1.1 eq of Na2SO3 in water for 8 h, followed by crystallization from water (19Arnold R.T. Dowdall J.F. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1948; 70: 2590-2591Crossref Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The inhibitors were synthesized by standard methods using side chain-protected P2 and P3 amino acids. The crude inhibitors were obtained after side chain deprotection and final hydrogenation followed by purification using a preparative reversed-phase HPLC. In the case of inhibitor 26, which was used as a lead compound in animal studies, an optimized synthesis strategy without side chain protection of both serine residues was developed (Scheme 1). Briefly, Boc-4-(acetyloxamidino)benzylamide II was obtained in three steps from p-cyanobenzylamine (Showa Denko, Japan) using a procedure described previously (20Judkins B.D. Allen G.D. Cook T.A.

After deprotection, Boc-Ser was coupled to III by the mixed anhydride procedure and the Boc group was removed by trifluoroacetic acid to give intermediate V. Bzls-d-Ser-OH, prepared by silylation of H-d-Ser-OH and addition of benzylsulfonyl chloride, was attached to V using PyBop/DIEA as coupling reagent. The final hydrogenation resulted in crude inhibitor 26, which was purified by cation ion exchange chromatography using an ammonium acetate gradient. The analytical methods (MS, HPLC, and NMR) and a detailed synthesis procedure for inhibitor 26 are described in the Supplemental Materials. The kinetic measurements with human uPA, plasmin, tPA, trypsin, thrombin, and factor Xa were performed as reported previously (21Stürzebecher J. Prasa D. Hauptmann J. Vieweg H. Wikström P. J. Med. Chem. 1997; 40: 3091-3099Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Rat uPA was cloned, expressed, and activated according to the following procedures. Cloning—To generate a PCR template for rat uPA cloning, reverse transcription was performed using a first strand cDNA synthesis kit (Roche) and a rat liver poly(A)+ RNA (Clontech). In the subsequent PCR, 5′-ACCATGAGAGTCTGGCTTGCGAGCC-3′ and 5′-TCAATGATGATGATGATGATGAGCGAAGGCTAGGCCATTCTCTTCTCC-3′ were used as primers. The PCR was performed with 30 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s, 55 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 1 min. A mixture of Taq and Pfu polymerase was used. The resulting PCR product was cloned into pcDNA3.1/V5-HisTOPO (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer's instructions. The correct sequence of the resulting rat-uPApcDNA3 vector was confirmed by sequencing. Expression and Activation—For expression of full-length rat prouPA, uPApcDNA3 was transformed into baby hamster kidney 21 cells. The cells were cultivated in RPMI1640 with 5% fetal calf serum (Invitrogen) at 37 °C. Expressed protein was isolated from the culture supernatant by nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid (Qiagen) chromatography under native conditions. Elution fractions that contained pro-uPA were pooled and dialyzed against Tris-buffered saline. Activation of pro-uPA was performed with biotinylated plasmin as described previously (22Klinghofer V. Stewart K. McGonigal T. Smith R. Sarthy A. Nienaber V. Butler C. Dorwin S. Richardson P. Weitzberg M. Wendt M. Rockway T. Zhao X. Hulkower K.I. Giranda V.L. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 9125-9131Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Anesthetized female Wistar rats, 240-320 g body weight (Charles River-Wiga, Sulzfeld, Germany), were used for the determination of the elimination half-life of selected inhibitors, as previously described (17Hauptmann J. Steinmetzer T. Vieweg H. Wikström P. Stürzebecher J. Pharm. Res. 2002; 19: 1027-1033Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar, 21Stürzebecher J. Prasa D. Hauptmann J. Vieweg H. Wikström P. J. Med. Chem. 1997; 40: 3091-3099Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). The inhibitors were administered in aqueous solution intravenously at a dose of 1 mg/kg. Blood samples were withdrawn into 3.8% sodium citrate solution (1/10, v/v) at different times after administration. The blood sample volume removed was replaced by injecting with the corresponding volume of saline. Citrated plasma was obtained by centrifugation at 1200 × g for 10 min, and the concentrations of the inhibitors were determined by a spectrophotometric assay. In preliminary assays it was demonstrated that these chromogenic measurements were in good agreement with results obtained with a reversed-phase HPLC system, which we have used previously for monitoring the inhibitor concentration in plasma (17Hauptmann J. Steinmetzer T. Vieweg H. Wikström P. Stürzebecher J. Pharm. Res. 2002; 19: 1027-1033Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Therefore, 150 or 175 μl of 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.0, containing 0.154 m NaCl) and 25 μl of substrate Pefachrome uPA (benzoyl-β-Ala-Gly-Arg-p-nitroanilide, stock 2 mm) were treated with 50 or 25 μl of a plasma sample at room temperature. The reaction was started by addition of 50 μl of uPA (Rheothromb 500.000, Curasane AG, Kleinostheim, Germany), dissolved in 0.9% NaCl as a 1 mg/ml solution, and monitored at 405 nm over a period of 5 min. From the observed reaction rate the inhibitor concentration in plasma was calculated using a calibration curve prepared with inhibitor concentrations in the range of 0.05-10 μg/ml. The crystallization of the enzyme-inhibitor complexes, data collection, and structure refinement was performed as described previously using a C122S mutant of the serine protease domain of uPA (βc-uPA) (15Zeslawska E. Jacob U. Schweinitz A. Coombs G. Bode W. Madison E. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 328: 109-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 23Zeslawska E. Schweinitz A. Karcher A. Sondermann P. Sperl S. Stürzebecher J. Jacob U. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 301: 465-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The βc-uPA·inhibitor complexes were prepared by soaking the inhibitors in crystals of the βc-uPA·benzamidine complex. The refinement statistics for x-ray analysis of all βc-uPA·inhibitor complexes is given in the Supplemental Materials. Pathogen-free, female CD1 nu/nu mice (9 weeks old; 25 g on average, Charles River) were inoculated with 1 × 106lacZ-tagged human fibrosarcoma cells (HT1080) into the tail vein of each mouse at day 0. HT1080 cells were stably transfected with a lacZ-coding plasmid (PLZ 12) to allow single cell detection of metastases (24Krüger A. Schirrmacher V. Khokha R. Canc. Metast. Rev. 1999; 17: 285-294Crossref Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The lacZ-tagged fibrosarcoma model offers a quantitative system after X-gal staining, allowing the study of experimental lung metastasis within 22 days after tumor cell inoculation (t.c.i.) as cells colonize the lung upon intravenous injection. At day 22, this results in the formation of macrometastatic foci (diameter >0.2 mm) in the lung. For the treatment, inhibitor 26 was freshly dissolved daily in sterile pyrogen-free H2O to a final concentration of 5% (v/v) ethanol. For the experimental lung metastasis assay, starting from day -1 (1 day before t.c.i.), 200 μl of the inhibitor solution or vehicle control were administered intraperitoneally twice daily at 1.5 mg/kg (equivalent to 3 mg/kg/day) until day +1 (1 day after t.c.i. = short treatment) or until the day prior to organ explantation at day 22 after t.c.i. (long treatment). Additionally, the body weight of mice was measured before and after the experiment as an indicator of health condition. A second experiment with a long treatment of inhibitor 26, in this case subcutaneously administered, was performed with the same treatment regimen. For the survival study, 200 μl of vehicle or inhibitor 26 solution were administered twice daily at a dose of 1.5 mg/kg (equivalent to 3 mg/kg/day) subcutaneously from day -1 until day 100. During the entire survival study the mice were monitored twice daily in terms of fitness and health status and sacrificed only when found to be moribund. The first three treatments of all experiments were performed at 24, 12, and 1 h before t.c.i. to influence early colonization of the lung by tumor cells through the inhibitor presence. Mice of the control and treatment groups were sacrificed 22 days after t.c.i., when experimental macrometastases are clearly visible and well quantifiable in the lung in this model. Lungs were removed and stained with X-gal (Roche Diagnostics, Penzberg, Germany). Indigo blue macrometastatic foci on the surface of the organs were counted, allowing assessment of the metastatic pattern (24Krüger A. Schirrmacher V. Khokha R. Canc. Metast. Rev. 1999; 17: 285-294Crossref Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Data of the experimental metastasis assay were analyzed using the Mann-Whitney rank sum test. The Kaplan-Meier survival curves were compared using the log rank test. Data were considered significantly different when p < 0.05. Snap-frozen tissue (one lung lobe) was homogenized for 20 s in a minibeadbeater™ in the presence of zirconium beads (1.0 mm diameter, Biospec Products Inc.) and 300 μl of extraction buffer (50 mm Tris/HCl, 5 mm CaCl2, 200 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, pH 7.5). After centrifugation of the tissue homogenate (4 °C, 12,000 × g, 10 min), the supernatant was collected, snap frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored in aliquots at -80 °C. Pellets of HT1080 cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and resuspended in Tris-buffered saline (pH 8.5), 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100. Zymographic detection of uPA activity was performed with 7.5 μg of total protein per lane (10% SDS-PAGE with 1 mg/ml gelatin and 3.8 μg/ml plasminogen (Roche Applied Science), non-reducing conditions). Plasminogen served as substrate for the uPA present in cell supernatants or homogenates of tissue, generating plasmin, which then degraded gelatin. After electrophoresis, proteins were renatured and the gel was incubated at 37 °C for 19 h in 100 mm Tris/HCl (pH 7.5) containing 200 mm EDTA to eliminate any gelatinase activity present in the samples. The gels were stained as described previously (25Edwards D.R. Leco K.J. Beaudry P.P. Atadja P.W. Veillette C. Riabowol K.T. Exp. Gerontol. 1996; 31: 207-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Prestained molecular weight markers (Kaleidoscope Prestained Standards, Bio-Rad) and human HMW-uPA (Ribosepharm, Haan, Germany) served as standards. Enzyme Kinetics—Besides uPA, five additional trypsin-like serine proteases were used to determine the specificity of the inhibitors. Trypsin was used as a standard enzyme for this protease class, whereas thrombin, factor Xa, tPA, and plasmin were selected to predict a possible influence on blood coagulation and fibrinolysis because of inhibitor treatment, which could lead to side effects during in vivo experiments. The previously reported lead structure Bzls-d-Ser-Gly-4-Amba (inhibitor 1) consists of four segments abbreviated as P4-P3-P2-P1 according to the nomenclature from Schechter and Berger (26Schechter I. Berger A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1967; 27: 157-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (4766) Google Scholar). Assuming that 4-Amba at P1 and the P3 amino acid d-Ser are essential residues in this inhibitor type, the P4-sulfonyl group and P2 residue were mainly optimized. Two additional inhibitors with modifications in the P3 position were synthesized to evaluate the contribution of the d-Ser side chain for uPA affinity. For variation of the P4 position, the benzylsulfonyl residue was maintained, because we demonstrated previously that analogues with the homologous phenylethylsulfonyl group and the shorter phenylsulfonyl residue were more than 10 times less potent uPA inhibitors (14Künzel S. Schweinitz A. Reißmann S. Stürzebecher J. Steinmetzer T. Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett. 2002; 12: 645-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The inhibitors summarized in Table I are mainly modified at the para position of the P4 phenyl ring or contain an additional free or esterified carboxyl group. The carboxyl groups were introduced because several examples with structurally related carboxylated protease inhibitors for thrombin or factor Xa are known from literature, which were less prone to a rapid hepatobiliary elimination (17Hauptmann J. Steinmetzer T. Vieweg H. Wikström P. Stürzebecher J. Pharm. Res. 2002; 19: 1027-1033Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar, 18Rewinkel J.B.M. Adang A.E.P. Current Pharm.

Haemostasis. 1999; 81: 358-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar).Table IInhibition constants for P4-modified inhibitors of the formula shown below Open table in a new tab The substitution of the P4 position by a single halogen or methyl residue (inhibitors 2, 3, and 4) has little influence on uPA affinity, whereas a moderate improvement in potency toward all of the used proteases was obtained with compound 8 containing an amino group at the para position. All other inhibitors were less active but still inhibit uPA with Ki values <0.5 μm. Most of the analogues were relatively selective, only some trypsin inhibition was observed. However, trypsin, which is released from the pancreas, appears only in the intestine and does not come into contact with the blood system or other tissues. Therefore, poor trypsin selectivity should not have any impact on the efficacy of these inhibitors in animal studies, as long as they are only parenterally applied. Because of small differences in affinity the Bzls-d-Ser segment was maintained for the optimization of the P2 position (Table II).Table IIInhibition constants for P2-modified inhibitors of the formula shown below Open table in a new tab Based on the inhibition constants determined for inhibitor 19, a d-amino acid residue is not accepted at the P2 position. Some of the analogues summarized in Table II are more potent uPA inhibitors compared with the lead compound 1. However, for 18 and 20 with Ala or Pro, the selectivity was strongly reduced. Specifically compound 20 is a potent thrombin inhibitor (Ki = 12 nm) and could influence blood clotting. This was not surprising because Pro is the preferred P2 residue in many types of thrombin inhibitors (28Steinmetzer T. Hauptmann J. Stürzebecher J. Exp. Opin. Investig. Drugs. 2001; 10: 845-864Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). In contrast, inhibitor 26, containing a Ser at P2 was a potent uPA inhibitor and maintained good selectivity. A high uPA affinity (Ki = 8.9 nm) was obtained also for Arg derivative 34. However, because of its plasmin affinity (Ki = 0.2 μm) it might also affect the fibrinolytic system. During the course of the clinical development of the thrombin inhibitor melagatran it was determined that the inhibition constant for plasmin should be above 0.5 μm to avoid bleeding (29Gustafsson D. Antonsson T. Bylund R. Eriksson U. Gyzander E. Nilsson I. Elg M. Mattsson C. Deinum J. Pehrsson S. Karlsson O. Nilsson A. Sörensen H. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1998; 79: 110-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). To evaluate the importance of the d-Ser side chain two additional analogues were synthesized (Table III).Table IIIInhibition constants for P3-modified inhibitors of the formula shown below Open table in a new tab Both, derivatives 35 and 36, are significantly less potent uPA inhibitors than the reference 1Mignatti P. Rifkin D.B. Physiol. Rev. 1993; 73: 161-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (1180) Google Scholar, whereas only minor differences between these 3 compounds with respect to the other enzymes were observed. This was expected, because the x-ray structure indicates that the d-Ser hydroxyl group acts as a hydrogen bond donator for the carbonyl oxygen of Leu97B and as an acceptor for the uPA residue His99 (15Zeslawska E. Jacob U. Schweinitz A. Coombs G. Bode W. Madison E. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 328: 109-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, only little differences in the uPA inhibition between the d-Ala and d-Dap derivatives were observed, because the free amino group of the d-Dap derivative should still allow the formation of a hydrogen bond to the carbonyl of Leu97B, which is not possible with the d-Ala compound. The inhibition constants for inhibitors with dual modifications in positions P4 and P2 are summarized in Table IV. Because of their high uPA affinity the P2 residues Ala and Ser were combined with the carboxyl group containing P4 residues, which were found to have an impact on the elimination rate (see Fig. 1A). In addition, their methylester precursors and other inhibitors with Cl or methyl groups were investigated.Table IVInhibition constants (Ki in μm) for inhibitors with combined modifications in P4 and P2 position of the formula shown below Open table in a new tab Fig. 1A, elimination half-life (β-phase) in rats after intravenous application of 1 mg/kg, determined for selected inhibitors.

https://openalex.org/W2100626492,"Signaling through the high affinity IgE receptor FcϵRI on human basophils and rodent mast cells is decreased by co-aggregating these receptors to the low affinity IgG receptor FcγRII. We used a recently described fusion protein, GE2, which is composed of key portions of the human γ1 and the human ϵ heavy chains, to dissect the mechanisms that lead to human mast cell and basophil inhibition through co-aggregation of FcγRII and FcϵRI. Unstimulated human mast cells derived from umbilical cord blood express the immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motif-containing receptor FcγRII but not FcγRI or FcγRIII. Interaction of the mast cells with GE2 alone did not cause degranulation. Co-aggregating FcϵRI and FcγRII with GE2 1) significantly inhibited IgE-mediated histamine release, cytokine production, and Ca2+ mobilization, 2) reduced the antigen-induced morphological changes associated with mast cell degranulation, 3) reduced the tyrosine phosphorylation of several cellular substrates, and 4) increased the tyrosine phosphorylation of the adapter protein downstream of kinase 1 (p62dok; Dok), growth factor receptor-bound protein 2 (Grb2), and SH2 domain containing inositol 5-phosphatase (SHIP). Tyrosine phosphorylation of Dok was associated with increased binding to Grb2. Surprisingly, in non-stimulated cells, there were complexes of phosphorylated SHIP-Grb2-Dok that were lost upon IgE receptor activation but retained under conditions of Fcϵ-Fcγ co-aggregation. Finally, studies using mast cells from Dok-1 knock-out mice showed that IgE alone triggers degranulation supporting an inhibitory role for Dok degranulation. Our results demonstrate how human FcϵRI-mediated responses can be inhibited by co-aggregation with FcγRIIB and implicate Dok, SHIP, and Grb2 as key intermediates in regulating antigen-induced mediator release.

Mast cells generate pro-inflammatory mediators that initiate and propagate allergic inflammation. IgE-mediated mediator release is initiated through the high affinity IgE receptor FcϵRI, 1The abbreviations used are: FcϵRI, high affinity receptor for IgE; FcϵR, receptor for IgE; FcγR, receptor for IgG; ITAM, immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif; ITIM, immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motif; BCR, B cell receptor; SHIP, SH2 domain containing inositol 5-phosphatase; Ab, antibody; mAb, monoclonal antibody; NIP, 3-nitro-4-hydroxy-5-iodophenylacetate; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; BSA, bovine serum albumin; PBS/BSA, phosphate-buffered saline with 0.1% bovine serum albumin; HBSS, Hanks' balanced salt solution; FACS, fluorescence-activated cell sorter; CBMCs, cord blood-derived human mast cells; TNF-α, tumor necrosis factor-α; RasGAP, Ras GTPase-activating protein; BMMCs, bone marrow-derived mast cells; SHP-1, Src homology domain containing protein-tyrosine phosphatase-1.1The abbreviations used are: FcϵRI, high affinity receptor for IgE; FcϵR, receptor for IgE; FcγR, receptor for IgG; ITAM, immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif; ITIM, immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motif; BCR, B cell receptor; SHIP, SH2 domain containing inositol 5-phosphatase; Ab, antibody; mAb, monoclonal antibody; NIP, 3-nitro-4-hydroxy-5-iodophenylacetate; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; BSA, bovine serum albumin; PBS/BSA, phosphate-buffered saline with 0.1% bovine serum albumin; HBSS, Hanks' balanced salt solution; FACS, fluorescence-activated cell sorter; CBMCs, cord blood-derived human mast cells; TNF-α, tumor necrosis factor-α; RasGAP, Ras GTPase-activating protein; BMMCs, bone marrow-derived mast cells; SHP-1, Src homology domain containing protein-tyrosine phosphatase-1. in which the α subunit has IgE binding activity and the β and γ subunits have signaling activity. Signaling is primarily mediated by immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motifs (ITAMs) located in the carboxyl-terminal cytoplasmic tails of each of the β and γ subunits. ITAMs are typically 26- or 27-amino acid stretches including two YXXL motifs separated by 9 or 10 amino acids. Cross-linking IgE-primed receptors with a multivalent antigen results in the activation of Lyn, which in turn phosphorylates ITAMs, creating docking sites for Syk kinase family members and permitting signal propagation (for review, see Ref. 1Turner H. Kinet J.P. Nature. 1999; 402: B24-B30Crossref PubMed Scopus (616) Google Scholar). Many immune cells that express ITAM-containing antigen receptors also express receptors with a related immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motifs (ITIMs). ITIMs are 13-amino acid sequences containing a single YXXL motif (2Muta T. Kurosaki T. Misulovin Z. Sanchez M. Nussenzweig M.C. Ravetch J.V. Nature. 1994; 368: 70-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar). They were first recognized in the cytoplasmic tails of the FcγRIIB isoform (FcγRIIB1) of rodent B cells. Their negative signaling activity was revealed by studies showing that co-aggregating the BCR with FcγRIIB1 inhibits the BCR-mediated activation of rodent B cells (3D'Ambrosio D. Hippen K.L. Minskoff S.A. Mellman I. Pani G. Siminovitch K.A. Cambier J.C. Science. 1995; 268: 293-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar). Studies in murine bone marrow derived mast cells (BMMCs) showed that co-aggregating murine FcγRIIB to FcϵRI also inhibits IgE-induced mast cell degranulation and that this inhibition is dependent on the intact intracytoplasmic tail of the FcγRIIB (4Daeron M. Malbec O. Latour S. Arock M. Fridman W.H. J. Clin. Investig. 1995; 95: 577-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). Further studies using RBL-2H3 cells transfected with cDNA encoding human wild type and mutant FcγRIIB showed that the intracytoplasmic domain responsible for the negative signaling is the ITIM found in FcγRIIB (5Daeron M. Latour S. Malbec O. Espinosa E. Pina P. Pasmans S. Fridman W.H. Immunity. 1995; 3: 635-646Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar). Subsequently, it was shown that the phosphorylation of the mast cell FcγRIIB-ITIM is mediated by Lyn and results in the recruitment of specific tyrosine phosphatases (6Malbec O. Fong D.C. Turner M. Tybulewicz V.L.J. Cambier J.C. Fridman W.H. Daeron M. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 1647-1658PubMed Google Scholar). The negative regulation of signaling through ITAM-containing receptors by signals generated by the co-cross-linked ITIM-containing FcγRIIB isoforms has been demonstrated in mouse and human B cells that naturally co-express the BCR and FcγRIIB1, in T cell and rodent mast cell lines that express the T cell receptor or FcϵRI plus endogenous or transfected FcγRIIB1 (5Daeron M. Latour S. Malbec O. Espinosa E. Pina P. Pasmans S. Fridman W.H. Immunity. 1995; 3: 635-646Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar), and in human basophils (7Kepley C.L. Cambier J.C. Morel P.A. Lujan D. Ortega E. Wilson B.S. Oliver J.M. J. Allergy Clin. Immunol. 2000; 106: 337-348Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Negative regulation by other ITIM-containing receptors has been demonstrated in several other model systems (8Ravetch J.V. Lanier L.L. Science. 2000; 290: 84-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (1058) Google Scholar). It is not clear whether human mast cells express ITIM receptors and whether IgE-mediated responses can be down-regulated through their activity. Although there has been a great effort to discover and study ITIM receptors, little progress has been made in harnessing their inherent inhibitory properties for potential therapeutic interventions. We recently showed that a novel human Fcϵ-Fcγ receptor-binding fusion protein (GE2) could inhibit human basophil functional and biochemical responses in vitro and in vivo (9Zhu D. Kepley C.L. Zhang M. Zhang K. Saxon A. Nat. Med. 2002; 8: 518-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar, 64Zhang K. Kepley C.L. Terada T. Daocheng Z. Perez H. Saxon A. J. Allergy Clin. Immunol. 2004; (in press)Google Scholar). Subsequently, it has been demonstrated that GE2 can inhibit IgE production by human B cell (10Yamada T. Zhu D. Zhang K. Saxon A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 32818-32824Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) and cytokine production from FcϵRI/FcγRII-expressing, Langerhan cell-like dendritic cells (11Kepley C.L. Zhang K. Zhu D. Saxon A. Clin. Immunol. 2003; 108: 89-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Here we used umbilical cord blood-derived human mast cells (CBMCs) to test the mechanisms of inhibition by FcϵRI-FcγRII co-aggregation on human mast cells. We demonstrated that human mast cells express FcγRII (CD32) but not FcγRI (CD64) or FcγRIII (CD16). We provide the first evidence that the functional responses of human mast cell FcϵRI can be down-regulated by FcγRII. The inhibition involves alterations in protein tyrosine phosphorylation, including Syk. We provide evidence that Grb2, Dok, and SHIP phosphorylation is associated with mast cell inactivation and FcγRII-mediated inhibition of FcϵRI responses. Although previous rodent studies have implicated SHIP, our findings further implicate Grb2 and Dok as additional “gatekeepers” of human FcϵRI signaling.

EDTA-treated (0.01% final) cord blood was layered over Ficoll-Hypaque (density 1.077; Sigma) 1:1 (v/v), and the tubes were centrifuged at 350 × g for 20 min at room temperature with no brake. Mononuclear cells recovered at the interphase were washed with phosphate-buffered saline with 0.1% bovine serum albumin (PBS/BSA). If red blood cell contamination was present, the pellet was resuspended in PBS/BSA and was relayered over the Ficoll (1:1, v/v), centrifuged, and washed as above. The CD34+ stem cells were isolated using a negative selection mixture and magnetic separation of non-CD34-positive cells using the technique given by the manufacturer (Miltenyi, Auburn, CA). The cells were suspended at a concentration of ∼0.5–1.0 × 106 cells/ml in Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium (Sigma) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Hyclone, Logan, UT), 100 ng/ml recombinant human stem cell factor and 50 ng/ml recombinant human interleukin-6 (IL-6) (both from BIOSOURCE, Camarillo, CA), 10 μm Hepes, 50 μm 2-mercaptoethanol, 4 mm l-glutamine, 1× minimum Eagle's medium amino acids, 1× vitamin solution (Invitrogen), 1 mm sodium pyruvate, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin (13Yamaguchi M. Sayama K. Yano K. Lantz C.S. Noben-Trauth N. Ra C. Costa J.J. Galli S.J. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 5455-5465PubMed Google Scholar). To enhance FcϵRI expression, human anti-NIP IgE (1 μg/ml) was added at least 1 week prior to each experiment (13Yamaguchi M. Sayama K. Yano K. Lantz C.S. Noben-Trauth N. Ra C. Costa J.J. Galli S.J. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 5455-5465PubMed Google Scholar). Cultures were maintained at 5% CO2 and 37 °C, and the medium was changed every 4–5 days with the cells placed back into the original flask. Cells were used at 6–9 weeks. As reported previously using a similar protocol (13Yamaguchi M. Sayama K. Yano K. Lantz C.S. Noben-Trauth N. Ra C. Costa J.J. Galli S.J. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 5455-5465PubMed Google Scholar), the purity of the mast cells was always greater than 90% as determined by tryptase immunostaining (14Irani A.-M.A. Bradford T.R. Kepley C.L. Schechter N.M. Schwartz L.B. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1989; 37: 1509-1515Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar) (data not shown). Aliquots of cells were removed on different days and before use for the analysis of viability (by trypan blue exclusion) and for cytospin preparation. Flow Cytometry—Cells were recovered by centrifugation at 800 × g at 4 °C, washed with PBS/BSA, and incubated for 30 min at 4 °C with a 1:500 dilution of normal human serum. The cells were washed and incubated with the indicated Abs (10 μg/ml) for 1 h at 4 °C. After antibody labeling, the cells were washed and incubated with a 1:100 dilution of F(ab′)2-fluorescein isothiocyanate-goat anti-mouse for 30 min at 4 °C. After three washes, cells were resuspended in 400 μl of PBS/BSA. The mean intensity fluorescence was determined for at least 10,000 cells using a Coulter Epics Elite flow cytometer. MOPC31C nonspecific mouse IgG or non-immune rabbit IgG was used as a negative control. All experiments were performed in duplicate. Cell Activation—CBMCs were suspended in fresh medium (without cytokines) and sensitized with 10 μg/ml human anti-NIP IgE overnight at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 incubator. The next morning, GE2 was added for at least 2 h to a final concentration indicated in the “Results” section. Cells were washed and activated, and mediator release was measured as described previously (15Kepley C.L. Wilson B.W. Oliver J.M. J. Allergy Clin. Immunol. 1998; 102: 304-315Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Intracellular Ca2+Concentration ([Ca2+]i) Measurements—IgE-sensitized mast cells (1 × 105 cells/condition), with or without GE2 challenge, were loaded with 2 μm (final v/v) Indo-1 (Fig. 3A) or Fura-2/AM (Fig. 3B) for 30 min at room temperature on a rocking platform. Washed cells were resuspended in fresh HBSS and kept at 37 °C. Following acquisition of base-line fluorescence values for ∼20–30 s using a FAC-Scaliber flow cytometer (Fig. 3A) or laser scanning confocal microscope system Olympus FluoView (Fig. 3B), HBSS with or without NIP/BSA or thapsigargin (Calbiochem) was added, and changes in the fluorescent ratio were measured for up to 10 min at 2-s intervals. Each experiment was done in duplicate. Transmission Electron Microscopy—Suspensions of IgE-sensitized CBMCs were challenged with or without GE2 (10 μg/ml) as above, washed, and incubated at 37 °C in prewarmed HBSS+ (HBSS with 1 mm CaCl2 and 1 mm MgCl2) without or with NIP/BSA (200 ng/ml) for 30 min. Cells were collected by centrifugation, and pellets were fixed in 2% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 m sodium cacodylate buffer, pH 7.4, for 30 min at room temperature, rinsed with cacodylate, and processed as described previously (16Kepley C.L. Youseff L. Andrews R.P. Wilson B.S. Oliver J.M. J. Allergy Clin. Immunol. 1999; 104: 279-284Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Thin sections were observed using a Hitachi 600 transmission electron microscope. Lysis, Immunoprecipitation, and Immunoblotting—IgE-sensitized mast cells, with or without GE2, were activated as above. Preparation of cell lysates, immunoprecipitation, and Western blotting were performed as described previously (7Kepley C.L. Cambier J.C. Morel P.A. Lujan D. Ortega E. Wilson B.S. Oliver J.M. J. Allergy Clin. Immunol. 2000; 106: 337-348Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Identification of FcγRs on CBMCs—ITIM-containing receptors are an expanding family of immune inhibitory receptors that have the ability to inhibit immune responses (8Ravetch J.V. Lanier L.L. Science. 2000; 290: 84-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (1058) Google Scholar). We are not aware of studies examining their expression on human mast cells. As seen in Fig. 1, CBMCs express, in addition to FcγRIIB, the ITIM-containing receptor CD22 and the ITIM-like-containing receptor CD81. Similar to what we have shown previously for human basophil FcγRs, human mast cells exclusively express the low affinity IgG receptor FcγRII. Thus CBMCs react strongly with the pan-anti-FcγRII mAb AT10 (Fig. 1). Confirming earlier studies examining cultured human mast cells, little or no FcγRI or FcγRIII expression was detected (17Okayama Y. Kirshenbaum A.S. Metcalfe D.D. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 4332-4339Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Thus, cultured human mast cells express only the low affinity IgG receptor FcγRII. There are multiple FcγRII isoforms, representing the products of three distinct genes (18Daeron M. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1997; 15: 203-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (1035) Google Scholar). Results of reverse transcription-PCR analysis using previously described methods (7Kepley C.L. Cambier J.C. Morel P.A. Lujan D. Ortega E. Wilson B.S. Oliver J.M. J. Allergy Clin. Immunol. 2000; 106: 337-348Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 19Metes D. Ernst L.K. Chambers W.H. Sulica A. Herberman R.B. Morel P.A. Blood. 1998; 91: 2369-2380Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) showed that CBMCs contain transcripts for the ITIM-containing FcγRII isoform FcγRIIB and the ITAM-containing FcγRII isoforms FcγRIIA and FcγRIIC (data not shown). However, we did not detect surface expression of FcγRIIA by FACS analysis using the FcγRIIA-specific Ab IV.3 (data not shown). In addition, no FcγRIIA was detected by Western blot analysis in mast cell lysates using an Ab raised against the cytoplasmic tail of FcγRIIA (Ab260), whereas strong signals were detected when using an FcγRIIB-specific Ab (Ab163; a gift of Dr. Susheela Tridandapani, Ohio State University, Columbus, OH) (Fig. 1, inset) (20Lyden T.W. Robinson J.M. Tridandapani S. Teillaud J.L. Garber S.A. Osborne J.M. Frey J. Budde P. Anderson C.L. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 3882-3889Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Thus, although CBMCs express mRNA for FcγRIIA, it appears that only FcγRIIB is expressed on the cellular membrane in unstimulated, human CBMCs. FcγRII-FcϵRI Co-aggregation Inhibits FcγRI-dependent Human Mast Cell Degranulation—Previous investigators have established that FcγRII-FcϵRI co-aggregation can inhibit FcϵRI responses in a variety of model systems. We designed and described an FcγR-FcϵR-binding chimeric protein that can directly induce this interaction (GE2; Ref. 9Zhu D. Kepley C.L. Zhang M. Zhang K. Saxon A. Nat. Med. 2002; 8: 518-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Fig. 2A shows the secretory responses induced by adding optimal concentrations of NIP/BSA (200 ng/ml) to CBMCs that had been sensitized with human anti-NIP IgE and treated with the GE2 fusion protein. GE2 incubation for 2 h prior to antigen stimulation inhibited IgE-mediated histamine release in a dose-dependent fashion. This inhibition could not be accounted for by competition between IgE and GE2 for FcϵRI binding as substitution of nonspecific purified IgE myeloma protein (PS-IgE) for the GE2 resulted in IgE-mediated release comparable with non-GE2-challenged control cells. Similar to what we reported previously using human basophils (9Zhu D. Kepley C.L. Zhang M. Zhang K. Saxon A. Nat. Med. 2002; 8: 518-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar), no secretion is induced by adding chimeric protein alone to IgE-sensitized and unsensitized cells (data not shown). In four separate experiments, co-aggregating FcϵRI and FcγRII with GE2 (10 μg/ml) reduced FcϵRI-mediated histamine secretion by an average of 68%. FcγRII-FcϵRI Co-aggregation Inhibits CBMCs FcϵRI-mediated TNF-α Production—Human mast cells produce TNF-α following IgE-mediated stimulation (21Galli S.J. N. Engl. J. Med. 1993; 328: 257-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (911) Google Scholar). The results in Fig. 2B show that anti-NIP IgE-sensitized CBMCs that were treated with GE2 released significantly less TNF-α in response to 12-h stimulation with NIP/BSA compared with sensitized but GE2-untreated cells. The average inhibition of FcϵRI-mediated TNF-α production by FcγRII-FcϵRI co-aggregation was 60 and 64% using 5 and 10 μg/ml, respectively. FcγRII-FcϵRI Co-aggregation Inhibits CBMCs FcϵRI-mediated Ca2+Mobilization—Previous studies have indicated that human mast cell FcϵRI-mediated degranulation and cytokine production both depend on the release of Ca2+ from intracellular stores and on the subsequent sustained influx of extracellular Ca2+ (22MacGlashan Jr., D. Guo C.-B. J. Immunol. 1991; 147: 2259-2269PubMed Google Scholar, 23Suzuki H. Takei M. Yanagida M. Nakahata T. Kawakami T. Fukamachi H. J. Immunol. 1997; 159: 5881-5888PubMed Google Scholar). We used the Ca2+ indicator dye Indo-1 and FACS analysis to examine the pattern of FcϵRI-mediated Ca2+ mobilization in human mast cells following GE2 treatment (Fig. 3). Cross-linking anti-NIP IgE-primed FcϵRI with NIP/BSA leads, after a lag phase, to a rapid increase in intracellular Ca2+ levels (Fig. 3A). This Ca2+ spike is followed by a sustained elevation in Ca2+ levels, the Ca2+ plateau, which persists for up to 3 min. In the experiment shown in Fig. 3A, the lag time from antigen addition to FcϵRI-mediated Ca2+ influx was ∼24 s. When cells were treated with GE2 prior to antigen challenge, the lag time from antigen addition to the initial rise in [Ca2+] more than doubled to 60 s. Thus, co-aggregating FcγRII and FcϵRI with GE2 decreases the initial Ca2+ mobilization in human mast cells. To further investigate whether co-aggregation inhibits the release of intracellular calcium stores, we utilized thapsigargin, which induces an increase in [Ca2+]i because of store leakage from the endoplasmic reticulum. As seen in Fig. 3B, thapsigargin induced a sustained increase in [Ca2+]i. However, when GE2 (10 μg/ml) and antigen were added prior to challenge with thapsigargin, the increase observed in [Ca2+]i was smaller, and a sustained phase of Ca2+ was lacking. These findings indicate that the effect of GE2 appeared to be mainly due to an inhibition of the endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ store as well as sustained, store-dependent [Ca2+]i influx. FcγRII-FcϵRI Co-aggregation Inhibits CBMCs FcϵRI-mediated Morphological Changes—Under transmission electron microscopy, unstimulated cultured human mast cells (Fig. 4A) show large unsegmented nuclei and relatively sparse endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondria. Granules are numerous and contain loosely packed matrix material plus occasional dense core material, multilamellar membranes, and internal vesicles. Fig. 4B shows the intracellular fusion of granules (arrows) and the extracellular release of granule contents associated with normal IgE-mediated mast cell activation (24Eguchi M. Electron Microsc. Rev. 1991; 4: 293-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar, 25Furitsu T. Saito H. Dvorak A. Schwartz L.B. Irani A.A. Burdick J.F. Ishizaka K. Ishizaka T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

In contrast, the granules in cells treated with GE2 remain individual and intact following antigen stimulation (Fig. 4C). FcγRII-FcϵRI Co-aggregation Affects FcϵRI-mediated Tyrosine Phosphorylation of Multiple Substrates—Protein tyrosine phosphorylation is a key event linking FcϵRI cross-linking to downstream signaling in human mast cells and basophils (15Kepley C.L. Wilson B.W. Oliver J.M. J. Allergy Clin. Immunol. 1998; 102: 304-315Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 16Kepley C.L. Youseff L. Andrews R.P. Wilson B.S. Oliver J.M.

Immunol. 1997; 159: 5881-5888PubMed Google Scholar). To investigate the effects of co-aggregating FcγRII-FcϵRI on IgE-mediated protein tyrosine phosphorylation, whole cell lysates of IgE-activated cells, with or without GE2 preincubation, were resolved by SDS-PAGE and probed with anti-Tyr(P) antibodies. As shown in Fig. 5A, NIP/BSA cross-linking of anti-NIP IgE-sensitized FcϵRI induced the tyrosine phosphorylation of several different substrates at 2, 5, and 15 min (lanes 2, 4, and 6) compared with non-activated cells (lane 1). The most prominent signals were species appearing at ∼110, 85, 76, 72, 66, 44, 42, 38, and 28 kDa. When cells were treated with GE2, tyrosine phosphorylation of several of these substrates was reduced. These included proteins with molecular masses of ∼85, 72, 66, 44, and 38 kDa (indicated with arrows). Thus, the down-regulation of IgE-mediated degranulation by co-aggregation of FcγRII and FcϵRI by GE2 appears to involve the reduction of tyrosine phosphorylation of several different proteins. Previous investigations have shown that the tyrosine kinase Syk is quickly phosphorylated in IgE-stimulated human FcϵRI-positive cells (15Kepley C.L. Wilson B.W. Oliver J.M. J. Allergy Clin. Immunol. 1998; 102: 304-315Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 23Suzuki H. Takei M. Yanagida M. Nakahata T. Kawakami T. Fukamachi H. J.

In human basophils, co-aggregation of FcϵRI and FcγRII with antigen-specific IgE and IgG (7Kepley C.L. Cambier J.C. Morel P.A. Lujan D. Ortega E. Wilson B.S. Oliver J.M. J. Allergy Clin.

Med. 2002; 8: 518-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar) inhibits the tyrosine phosphorylation of Syk. As seen in Fig. 5B using whole cell lysates of CBMCs, co-aggregation by GE2 reduced the tyrosine phosphorylation of a protein with the approximate molecular mass of Syk (∼72 kDa). Thus, we wanted to examine specifically the phosphorylation of Syk in GE2-treated CBMCs after IgE stimulation. Cells with or without GE2 preincubation were stimulated for the indicated periods and lysed, and anti-Syk immunoprecipitates were analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-Tyr(P) Ab. As seen in Fig. 5B Syk was tyrosine-phosphorylated within 2 min after addition of antigen. The amount of Syk tyrosine phosphorylation was markedly reduced in IgE-activated cells that had been treated with GE2 compared with non-treated IgE-activated cells. Grb2 Phosphorylation Is Increased in Resting and FcγRII-FcϵRI-co-aggregated Cells—Grb2 is an adapter protein associated with FcϵRI and FcγRIIB signaling (28Turner H. Reif K. Rivera J. Cantrell D.A.

ALK7 is a type I receptor for Nodal. Recently, we demonstrated that Nodal mRNA and several ALK7 transcripts are expressed in human placenta throughout pregnancy (Roberts, H. J., Hu, S., Qiu, Q., Leung, P. C. K., Cannigia, I., Gruslin, A., Tsang, B., and Peng, C. (2003) Biol. Reprod. 68, 1719–1726). In this study, we determined the role of Nodal and ALK7 in trophoblast cell proliferation and apoptosis. Overexpression of Nodal in normal trophoblast cells (HTR8/SVneo) and several choriocarcinoma cell lines resulted in a significant decrease in the number of metabolically active cells. The effect of Nodal could be mimicked by constitutively active ALK7 (ALK7-ca), but was blocked by kinase-deficient ALK7. The growth inhibitory effect of Nodal was also blocked by dominant-negative Smad2/3. Overexpression of Nodal and ALK7-ca induced apoptosis in trophoblast cells as determined by Hoechst staining, flow cytometry, and caspase-3 Western blotting. In addition, Nodal and ALK7-ca decreased the number of proliferating cells as measured by bromodeoxyuridine assays. Furthermore, overexpression of Nodal or ALK7-ca increased p27 expression, but reduced the levels of Cdk2 and cyclin D1. Taken together, this study demonstrates for the first time that Nodal, acting through ALK7 and Smad2/3, inhibits proliferation and induces apoptosis in human trophoblast cells. Our findings also suggest that the Nodal-ALK7 pathway inhibits cell proliferation by inducing G1 cell cycle arrest and that this effect is mediated in part by the p27-cyclin E/Cdk2 pathway.

The role of Nodal has been extensively studied in mouse, Xenopus, and zebrafish, in which Nodal and its related proteins have been found to be critical for mesoderm formation and left-right axis patterning during early development (7Brennan J.

Studies in rodents have shown that Nodal may inhibit the differentiation of stem trophoblast cells into giant cells. Homozygous mutations of the nodal gene in mice result in excessive numbers of trophoblast giant cells (10Iannaccone P.M. Chou X. Khokha M. Boucher D. Kuehn M.R. Dev. Dyn. 1992; 194: 198-208Google Scholar). On the other hand, overexpression of Nodal in the rat choriocarcinoma cell line Rcho-1 decreases giant cell numbers (11Ma G.T. Soloveva V. Tzeng S.-J.

ALK7 (activin receptor-like kinase-7) is a type I receptor belonging to the serine/threonine kinase receptor family. The serine/threonine kinase receptor family consists of two related groups of receptors termed type I and type II receptors. The type I and type II receptors form functional complexes to mediate signaling by members of the TGF-β superfamily (1Massagué J. Chen Y.-G. Genes Dev. 2000; 6: 627-644Google Scholar, 2Zimmerman C.M. Padgett R.W. Gene (Amst.). 2000; 249: 17-30Google Scholar, 3Chang H. Brown C.W. Matzuk M.M. Endocr. Rev. 2002; 23: 787-823Google Scholar). In mammals, seven type I (known as ALK1–7) and five type II receptors have been characterized. Both type I and type II receptors have similar structural features, including an extracellular ligand-binding domain, a transmembrane domain, and an intracellular serine/threonine kinase domain (1Massagué J. Chen Y.-G. Genes Dev. 2000; 6: 627-644Google Scholar). In addition, type I receptors also have a GS box, which serves as an activation domain for their type II receptor partners (13Wrana J.L. Attisano L. Wieser R. Ventura F. Massagué J. Nature. 1994; 370: 341-347Google Scholar). Upon activation, type I receptors phosphorylate two distinct sets of receptor-regulated Smad proteins, Smad1/5/8 (activated by ALK1/2/3/6) and Smad2/3 (activated by ALK4/5/7) (14Miyazawa K. Shinozaki M. Hara T. Furuya T. Miyazono K. Genes Cells. 2002; 7: 1191-1204Google Scholar, 15Liu F. Front. Biosci. 2003; 8: S1280-S1303Google Scholar, 16Derynck R. Zhang Y.E.

ALK7 was initially cloned from the rat and found to be predominantly expressed in the central nervous system (17Tsuchida K. Sawchenko P.E. Nishikawa S.I. Vale W.W. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 1996; 7: 467-478Google Scholar, 18Rydén M. Imamura T. Jörnvall H. Belluardo N. Neveu I. Trupp M. Okadome T. ten Dijke P. Ibanez C.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30603-30609Google Scholar). Nodal has been recently identified to be the physiological ligand of ALK7 (19Reissmann E. Jornvall H. Blokzijl A. Anderson O. Chang C. Minchiotti G. Persico M.G. Ibanex C. Brivanlou A.H. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 2010-2022Google Scholar). The kinase domain of ALK7 is closely related to that of ALK4 and ALK5 (12Roberts H.J. Hu S. Qiu Q. Leung P.C.K. Cannigia I. Gruslin A. Tsang B. Peng C. Biol. Reprod. 2003; 68: 1719-1726Google Scholar, 17Tsuchida K. Sawchenko P.E. Nishikawa S.I. Vale W.W. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 1996; 7: 467-478Google Scholar, 18Rydén M. Imamura T. Jörnvall H.

Similar to ALK4 and ALK5, ALK7 also activates the Smad2/3 signaling pathway (20Bondestam J. Huotari M.A. Moren A. Ustinov J. Kaivo-Oja N. Kallio J. Horelli-Kuitunen N. Aaltonen J. Fujii M.

Seino Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 254: 707-712Google Scholar). The human ALK7 cDNA has been recently cloned by us (12Roberts H.J. Hu S. Qiu Q. Leung P.C.K. Cannigia I. Gruslin A. Tsang B. Peng C. Biol. Reprod. 2003; 68: 1719-1726Google Scholar) and another group (20Bondestam J. Huotari M.A. Moren A. Ustinov J. Kaivo-Oja N. Kallio J. Horelli-Kuitunen N. Aaltonen J. Fujii M. Moustakas A. ten Dijke P. Otonkoski T. Ritvos O. Cytogenet. Cell Genet. 2001; 95: 157-162Google Scholar). We found that alternative splicing of the ALK7 gene generates four transcripts, designated ALK7-1, -2, -3, and –4 (12Roberts H.J. Hu S. Qiu Q. Leung P.C.K. Cannigia I. Gruslin A. Tsang B. Peng C. Biol. Reprod. 2003; 68: 1719-1726Google Scholar). ALK7-1 encodes full-length ALK7, whereas the other transcripts encode three novel ALK7 isoforms (12Roberts H.J. Hu S. Qiu Q. Leung P.C.K. Cannigia I. Gruslin A. Tsang B. Peng C. Biol. Reprod. 2003; 68: 1719-1726Google Scholar). These isoforms include a truncated receptor missing the ligand-binding domain and two soluble proteins that have the ligand-binding domain, but no transmembrane domain (12Roberts H.J. Hu S. Qiu Q. Leung P.C.K. Cannigia I. Gruslin A. Tsang B. Peng C. Biol. Reprod. 2003; 68: 1719-1726Google Scholar). Unlike rat ALK7, human ALK7 is widely distributed in various tissues, including brain, pancreas, kidney, ovary, and placenta (12Roberts H.J. Hu S. Qiu Q. Leung P.C.K. Cannigia I. Gruslin A. Tsang B. Peng C. Biol. Reprod. 2003; 68: 1719-1726Google Scholar). Using reverse transcription (RT)-PCR and Western blot analysis, we have found that ALK7 and its isoforms are expressed in placenta from early to late gestation (12Roberts H.J. Hu S. Qiu Q. Leung P.C.K. Cannigia I. Gruslin A. Tsang B. Peng C. Biol. Reprod. 2003; 68: 1719-1726Google Scholar), suggesting a role for ALK7 during pregnancy. The role of ALK7 is largely unknown. In the rat neuronal cell line PC12, ALK7 has been found to arrest cell proliferation and to induce morphological differentiation (21Jörnvall H. Blokzijl A. ten Dijke P. Ibanez C.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 5140-5146Google Scholar). Nodal has been shown to interact with two types of receptor complexes. First, Nodal can bind to the activin receptor complex containing activin receptors IIB and IB (ALK4) (19Reissmann E. Jornvall H. Blokzijl A. Anderson O. Chang C. Minchiotti G. Persico M.G. Ibanex C. Brivanlou A.H. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 2010-2022Google Scholar, 23Yeo C. Whitman M. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 949-957Google Scholar, 24Yan Y.T. Liu J.J. Luo Y. Chaosu E. Haltiwanger R.S. Abate-Shen C. Shen M.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 4439-4449Google Scholar). Signaling of Nodal through this receptor complex requires Cripto since, in the absence of Cripto, Nodal loses its signaling activity through the activin receptor complex (19Reissmann E. Jornvall H. Blokzijl A. Anderson O. Chang C. Minchiotti G. Persico M.G. Ibanex C. Brivanlou A.H. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 2010-2022Google Scholar, 23Yeo C. Whitman M. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 949-957Google Scholar, 24Yan Y.T. Liu J.J. Luo Y. Chaosu E. Haltiwanger R.S. Abate-Shen C. Shen M.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 4439-4449Google Scholar, 25Kumar A. Novoselov V. Celeste A.J. Wolfman N.M. ten Dijke P. Kuehn M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 656-661Google Scholar). The other receptor complex that mediates Nodal action is activin receptor IIB-ALK7 (19Reissmann E. Jornvall H. Blokzijl A. Anderson O. Chang C. Minchiotti G. Persico M.G. Ibanex C. Brivanlou A.H. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 2010-2022Google Scholar). Interaction of Nodal with activin receptor IIB-ALK7 is not dependent on Cripto, although overexpression of Cripto enhances the signaling activity of Nodal through ALK7 (19Reissmann E. Jornvall H. Blokzijl A. Anderson O. Chang C. Minchiotti G. Persico M.G. Ibanex C. Brivanlou A.H. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 2010-2022Google Scholar). Progression of cells through the cell cycle requires sequential activation of cyclin-dependent kinases and their regulatory subunits, cyclins (26Schafer K.A. Vet. Pathol. 1998; 35: 461-478Google Scholar, 27Vidal A. Koff A. Gene (Amst.). 2000; 247: 1-15Google Scholar, 28Morgan D.O. Ann. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1997; 13: 261-291Google Scholar). During progression through G1 phase, expression of D-type cyclins (D1, D2, and D3) increases, and they then associate with and activate Cdk4/6 (27Vidal A. Koff A. Gene (Amst.). 2000; 247: 1-15Google Scholar). On the other hand, an increase in cyclin E/Cdk2 activity is required for transition from G1 to S phase (27Vidal A. Koff A. Gene (Amst.). 2000; 247: 1-15Google Scholar, 28Morgan D.O. Ann. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1997; 13: 261-291Google Scholar). The Cdk4/6 and Cdk2 activities are controlled by two groups of cell cycle inhibitors, the Ink4 and Cip/Kip families, respectively (26Schafer K.A. Vet. Pathol. 1998; 35: 461-478Google Scholar, 27Vidal A. Koff A. Gene (Amst.). 2000; 247: 1-15Google Scholar). The Ink4 family is composed of several proteins, including p15, p16, p18, and p19 whereas the Cip/Kip family has three members, p21, p27, and p57 (28Morgan D.O. Ann. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1997; 13: 261-291Google Scholar). Many of these cell cycle inhibitors, such as p21, p27, and p15, have been shown to be regulated by TGF-β and are involved in TGF-β-induced cell growth arrest (29Donovan J. Slingerland J. Breast Cancer Res. 2000; 2: 116-124Google Scholar). In this study, we investigated the role and signaling of Nodal and ALK7 in normal and tumor trophoblast cell lines. We demonstrated that overexpression of Nodal and constitutively active ALK7 inhibited proliferation and induced apoptosis. The effect of Nodal is mediated by ALK7 and Smad2/3, as the dominant-negative forms of these molecules blocked the effect of Nodal on trophoblast cell growth. Furthermore, we identified several genes that are involved in cell cycle progression as targets of Nodal and ALK7. Cell Lines and Cell Culture—The human choriocarcinoma cell lines JEG-3, JAR, and BeWo were obtained from American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). The immortalized first trimester trophoblast cell line HTR8/SVneo was established from normal human trophoblast cells as described previously (30Graham C.H. Hawley T.S. Hawley R.G. MacDougall J.R. Kerbel R.S. Khoo N. Lala P.K. Exp. Cell Res. 1993; 206: 204-211Google Scholar). A stable JAR cell line overexpressing Smad3 (JAR-Smad3/c) was developed as described previously (31Xu G. Chakraborty C. Lala P.K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 294: 1079-1086Google Scholar). JEG-3, JAR, JAR-Smad3/c, and HTR8/SVneo cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium (Invitrogen), whereas BeWo cells were cultured in Ham's F-12 medium and Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (1:1; Hyclone Laboratories, Logan, UT) supplemented with 100 IU/ml penicillin and 100 μg/ml streptomycin (Invitrogen) in the presence of 10% fetal bovine serum (Sigma). RNA Extraction and RT-PCR—Total RNA was extracted using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer's protocols and stored at –80 °C until RT-PCR analysis. Five micrograms of total RNA was reverse-transcribed into cDNA in a total volume of 50 μl using 0.5 μg of oligo(dT) primer (Amersham Biosciences) and 500 units of Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (New England Biolabs Inc., Mississauga, Ontario, Canada). The reaction was carried out at 37 °C for 2 h in 1× reaction buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.3), 75 mm KCl, 3 mm MgCl2, and 10 mm dithiothreitol) containing 0.5 mm dNTPs, 10 mm dithiothreitol, and 50 units of RNase inhibitor (RNAguard, Amersham Biosciences) and terminated by heating the mixture at 95 °C for 5 min. An aliquot of the cDNA sample (2 μl) was subjected to PCR, which was performed in the presence of 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.3), 2.0 mm MgCl2, 50 μm deoxynucleotide triphosphate, 1 unit of Hotstar Taq (QIAGEN Inc., Mississauga), and 10 pmol of primers for 25–40 cycles depending on the cDNA target to be amplified. Primers for ALK7 transcripts, Nodal, p15, p21, p27, and the internal control GAPDH are listed in Table I. Primers for Smad2, -3, and -4 have been reported previously (32Xu G. Chakraborty C. Lala P.K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 287: 47-55Google Scholar). The annealing temperature for PCR ranged from 50 to 65 °C depending on the primer sets used. Levels of p15, p21, and p27 mRNAs were quantified by normalizing the spot densities of these molecules to their respective GAPDH control. Data from individual experiments were converted to -fold of control (empty vector-transfected cells) before being pooled.Table IPrimer sequencesTarget mRNASequence (5′ → 3′)ALK7-1, -3, -4 (AY127050)Forward primerGCACTTCAAAAGGGTGTCGReverse primerGATCATTCCAGCCATGGTCALK7-2 (AF525679)Forward primerCGAATTCACTGCGCCAAGGTCReverse primerGTGCAGTGTTGTGTTGTTGCAALK7-1 (AY127050)Forward primerATGACCCGGGCGCTCTGCTCAReverse primerATACTGTCAGCATCGCAGCTANodal (AB067630)Forward primerAGACATCATCCGCAGCCTACAReverse primerGTCCATCTGAAACCGCTCTAAGp15 (BC014469)Forward primerTGGGAAAGAAGGGAAGAGTGReverse primerGAACCTGGCGTCAGTCCCCCGTGGCTp21 (U03106)Forward primerTGAGCGATGGAACTTCGACTReverse primerTTAGGGCTTCCTCTTCGACTp27 (U10906)Forward primerTGCCCGAGTTCTACTACAGAReverse primerTTTGGGGAACCGTCTGAAACGAPDH (M33197)Forward primerAAGGTCATCCCTGAGCTGAACReverse primerACGCCTGCTTCACCACCTTCTALK7 expression construct (AY127050)Forward primerCGGAATTCCGCGATGACCCGGGCGCTCTGCTReverse primerTCCCCGCGGGGCTTTGCAGTCTTCTTTGACACANodal expression construct (AB067630)Forward primerCGGAATTCCACCATGCACGCCCACTGCReverse primerCGGAATTCCGGAGGCACCCACATTCTTCCAC Open table in a new tab Generation of Recombinant Constructs—Expression constructs containing the coding regions of ALK7-1 and Nodal were cloned into pcDNA4/TO/Myc-His (Invitrogen). ALK7-1 and Nodal cDNAs were amplified from normal placental tissues by RT-PCR using primers with EcoRI and SacII linkers for ALK7-1 and two EcoRI linkers for Nodal (Table I). Constitutively active ALK7 (ALK7-ca) was generated by replacing Thr194 with aspartic acid, and kinase-deficient ALK7 (ALK7-kd) was generated by replacing Lys222 with arginine using site-directed mutagenesis. Expression constructs of dominant-negative Smad2 and Smad3 in the pRK5F vector were kindly provided by Dr. R. Derynck (University of California, San Francisco) and were subcloned into pcDNA3.1 (Invitrogen) before being used in the experiments. All constructs were fully sequenced. Transient Transfection—Transient transfection was carried out using 25-kDa polyethyleneimine (Sigma) as described previously (33Wu D. Luo S. Wang Y. Zhuang L. Chen Y. Peng C. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 2001; 175: 111-121Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were seeded at 50% cell density on tissue culture dishes (Sarstedt, Inc., Montreal, Quebec, Canada) and allowed to adhere and grow overnight. The cells were washed, and the culture medium was replaced with reduced serum Opti-MEM (Invitrogen) 2 h prior to transfection. Plasmid DNA and 0.18 mm polyethyleneimine (0.28 μl/1 μg of DNA) were diluted into 150 mm NaCl. After incubation at room temperature for 10 min, these two solutions were mixed and further incubated at room temperature for 20 min. The polyethyleneimine/DNA mixture was then diluted into Opti-MEM and added to the cells. After overnight incubation at 37 °C, the culture medium was changed to RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Transfection efficiency, estimated by transfecting the cells with pEGFP, was >60% for 100-mm dishes, 40–50% for cells in 24-well plates, and 30% for cells cultured in 96-well plates. Determination of Cell Growth—Cell growth was determined either by direct cell counting or by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay. For cell counting experiments, JEG-3, JAR, and JAR-Smad3/c cells were cultured in 24-well culture plates at a cell density of 2 × 105 cells/well. Cells were transiently transfected with 1 μg of pcDNA4, wild-type ALK7 (ALK7-wt), and ALK7-ca plasmid DNA (n = 6). Cells were trypsinized 48 h after transfection, and cell number was counted using a hemocytometer. Each experiment was repeated three times. For MTT assays, JEG-3, JAR, JAR-Smad3/c, and HTR8/SVneo cells were seeded on 96-well plates at a density of 104 cells/well. After 16–18 h of incubation, cells were transfected with different constructs (0.3 μg/well) as indicated in the figures using the above-mentioned procedure (n = six to eight wells). Forty-eight hours after transfection, the number of metabolically active cells was measured using an MTT cell proliferation kit I (Roche Diagnostics) following the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, MTT labeling solution was added to the culture medium at the end of each experiment, and cells were further incubated for 3 h. Mitochondrial dehydrogenase activity reduced the yellow MTT dye to a purple formazan, which was then solubilized by overnight incubation with the MTT-solubilizing reagent (10% SDS in 0.01 HCl), and absorbance was read at 595 nm on an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay plate reader (Bio-Tek Instruments, Inc.). Flow Cytometry—JEG-3 cells were plated on 100-mm dishes and transfected with 15 μg of pcDNA4, ALK7-wt, ALK7-ca, or Nodal constructs. Forty-eight hours after transfection, proliferation and apoptosis assays were performed. Proliferation was determined by measuring incorporation of bromodeoxyuridine (BrdUrd) into DNA. Cells were incubated with 10 μm BrdUrd (Sigma) for 1 h, trypsinized, washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and fixed in ethanol. The cell suspension was then treated with 2 n HCl at 37 °C for 30 min, washed with 0.1 m NaB4O7, and resuspended in PBS containing 0.5% Tween 20 and 1% bovine serum albumin to a density of 106 cells/100 μl. Cells were further incubated with 10 μl of fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated mouse anti-BrdUrd monoclonal antibody (Dako Corp., Mississauga) for 30 min. After washing, the cells were resuspended in PBS containing 5 μg/ml propidium iodide and immediately analyzed using a FACScan (BD Biosciences). Apoptosis was assayed using an annexin V apoptosis detection kit (Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc., Santa Cruz, CA) following the instructions of the manufacturer. Briefly, cells were trypsinized and then pelleted by centrifugation. The cells were washed twice with cold PBS and resuspended in the assay buffer to obtain a density of 106 cells/ml. Annexin V-fluorescein isothiocyanate was added to cell aliquots (2 × 105 cells), followed by incubation at room temperature in the dark for 15 min. The cells were then washed with cold PBS and subjected immediately to FACScan analysis. Hoechst Staining—JEG-3 cells were seeded on 100-mm culture dishes and transfected with pcDNA4, ALK7-wt, ALK7-ca, or Nodal plasmid DNA (15 μg/dish). Forty-eight hours after transfection, cells were subjected to trypsin treatment at 37 °C for 3 min, fixed with 4% formalin in PBS, and washed with PBS. Cells were then incubated with 0.1 μg/ml Hoechst 33248 (bisbenzimide, Sigma) and spotted on slides for microscopy. Nuclear morphology was observed and photographed using a Zeiss Axiovert 35 fluorescent microscope. Protein Extraction and Western Blot Analyses—HTR8/SVneo and JEG-3 cells cultured in 100-mm dishes were transfected with 15 μg/dish plasmid DNA (pcDNA4, ALK7-ca, ALK7-kd, Nodal, or Nodal plus ALK7-kd). Forty-eight hours after transfection, cells were washed twice with ice-cold PBS and lysed with radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% deoxycholate, and 1% SDS) containing 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm Na3VO4, 5 mm NaF, 100 mm EDTA, 10 mg/ml aprotinin, and 100 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Protein samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE and blotted onto a nitrocellulose membrane. The membrane was blocked with TBST (10 mm Tris-Cl (pH 8.0), 150 mm NaCl, and 0.05% Tween 20) containing 10% nonfat dry milk powder (TBSTM) at room temperature for 30 min. The membrane was then incubated for 2 h at room temperature with a primary antibody (rabbit anti-cleaved caspase-3 (Asp175) polyclonal antibody (1:2000) (Cell signaling Technology); goat anti-Cdk2 polyclonal antibody (1:500), mouse anti-cyclin D1 monoclonal antibody (1:2000), mouse anti-cyclin E monoclonal antibody (1:2000) (all from Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc.); or goat anti-p27 polyclonal antibody (1:2000) (BD Signal Transduction)) prepared in TBSTM. The membranes were washed three times with TBST for 15 min each and then incubated for 2 h with a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (donkey anti-rabbit IgG, goat anti-mouse IgG, or rabbit anti-goat IgG antibody (1:5000)) in TBSTM. After washing as described above, signals were detected using an ECL kit (Amersham Biosciences) according to the instructions of the manufacturer. Statistical Analysis—Differences among several groups were determined by one-way analysis of variance, followed by Student-Newman-Keul's test using GraphPad InStat software. For comparison between two groups, Student's t test was used. p < 0.05 was considered significant. Expression of ALK7, Nodal, and Smad mRNAs in Trophoblast Cell Lines—The mRNA expression of ALK7, Nodal, Smad2, and Smad3 was determined in several trophoblast cell lines, including JEG-3, JAR, and BeWo choriocarcinoma cells; a stable JAR cell line overexpressing Smad3; and an immortalized normal trophoblast cell line, HTR8/SVneo. Using a pair of primers spanning exons III and IV of the ALK7 gene, which are known to be alternatively spliced to generate different transcripts (12Roberts H.J. Hu S. Qiu Q. Leung P.C.K. Cannigia I. Gruslin A. Tsang B. Peng C. Biol. Reprod. 2003; 68: 1719-1726Google Scholar), we detected three DNA fragments corresponding to the expected sizes of ALK7-1, -3, and -4 in all trophoblast cell lines tested (Fig. 1A). Similarly, when a pair of primers specific for ALK7-2 was used in PCR, a DNA fragment of the expected size was obtained (Fig. 1A). Since ALK7 has been shown to mediate the effect of Nodal in mesoderm induction (19Reissmann E. Jornvall H. Blokzijl A. Anderson O. Chang C. Minchiotti G. Persico M.G. Ibanex C. Brivanlou A.H. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 2010-2022Google Scholar) and to activate Smad2 and Smad3 (23Yeo C. Whitman M. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 949-957Google Scholar, 25Kumar A. Novoselov V. Celeste A.J. Wolfman N.M. ten Dijke P. Kuehn M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 656-661Google Scholar), we also examined mRNA expression of Nodal, Smad2, and Smad3. Similar to our previous studies that showed that Nodal mRNA is expressed in JEG-3 cells and in normal placenta (12Roberts H.J. Hu S. Qiu Q. Leung P.C.K. Cannigia I. Gruslin A. Tsang B. Peng C. Biol. Reprod. 2003; 68: 1719-1726Google Scholar), RT-PCR detected Nodal mRNA in JEG-3, JAR, JAR-Smad3/c, and HTR8/SVneo cells (Fig. 1A). Both Smad2 and Smad3 mRNAs were detected in the trophoblast cell lines (Fig. 1B). Whereas Smad2 mRNA levels were similar in all cell lines tested, Smad3 mRNA levels were much lower in JEG-3 and JAR cells than in the other cell lines, confirming our previous findings (33Wu D. Luo S. Wang Y. Zhuang L. Chen Y. Peng C. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 2001; 175: 111-121Google Scholar). Nodal and ALK7 Inhibit Trophoblast Cell Growth via Smad2/3—To determine the function of ALK7 in trophoblast cells, we first evaluated its effect on cell growth. JEG-3, JAR, and JAR-Smad3/c cells were transiently transfected with ALK7-wt, ALK7-ca, or the empty vector as a negative contr"
https://openalex.org/W2011063821,"Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) is a tumor suppressor gene syndrome with manifestations that can include seizures, mental retardation, autism, and tumors in the brain, retina, kidney, heart, and skin. The products of the TSC1 and TSC2 genes, hamartin and tuberin, respectively, heterodimerize and inhibit the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR). We found that tuberin expression increases p42/44 MAPK phosphorylation and B-Raf kinase activity. Short interfering RNA down-regulation of tuberin decreased the p42/44 MAPK phosphorylation and B-Raf activity. Expression of Rheb, the target of the GTPase-activating domain of tuberin, inhibited wild-type B-Raf kinase but not activated forms of B-Raf. The interaction of endogenous Rheb with B-Raf was enhanced by serum and by Ras overexpression. A farnesylation-defective mutant of Rheb co-immunoprecipitated with and inhibited B-Raf but did not activate ribosomal protein S6 kinase, indicating that farnesylation is not required for B-Raf inhibition by Rheb and that B-Raf inhibition and S6 kinase activation are separable activities of Rheb. Consistent with this, inhibition of B-Raf and p42/44 MAPK by Rheb was resistant to rapamycin in contrast to Rheb activation of S6 kinase, which is rapamycin-sensitive. Taken together these data demonstrate that inhibition of B-Raf kinase via Rheb is an mTOR-independent function of tuberin.

Tuberin has a highly conserved domain near the carboxyl terminus with homology to Rap1 GTPase-activating protein (GAP) (5Xiao G.H. Shoarinejad F. Jin F. Golemis E.A. Yeung R.S. J. Biol.

Most recently, Rheb (Ras homolog enriched in brain), a member of the Ras/Rap/Ral subfamily of Ras proteins (23Yamagata K. Sanders L.K. Kaufmann W.E. Yee W. Barnes C.A. Nathans D. Worley P.F. J. Biol.

While characterizing the effects of tuberin re-expression in tuberin-null ELT3 cells, we found that tuberin expression increases the phosphorylation of p42/44 MAPK. Rheb has been shown previously to negatively regulate an upstream activator of p42/44 MAPK, B-Raf kinase (31Im E. von Lintig F.C. Chen J. Zhuang S. Qui W. Chowdhury S. Worley P.F. Boss G.R. Pilz R.B. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 6356-6365Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). However, other investigators have not found a consistent relationship between tuberin expression and p42/44 MAPK activation (27Tee A.R. Manning B.D. Roux P.P. Cantley L.C. Blenis J. Curr. Biol. 2003; 13: 1259-1268Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (924) Google Scholar, 29Garami A. Zwartkruis F.J. Nobukuni T. Joaquin M. Roccio M. Stocker H. Kozma S.C. Hafen E. Bos J.L.

Carpenter C.L. Kwiatkowski D.J. J. Clin. Investig. 2003; 112: 1223-1233Crossref PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar), and one group found that tuberin negatively regulated B-Raf kinase activity (33Yoon H.S. Ramachandiran S. Chacko M.A. Monks T.J. Lau S.S. Am. J. Physiol. 2004; 286: F417-F424Google Scholar), the opposite of what would be expected if Rheb inhibits B-Raf. Here we demonstrate that tuberin expression increases B-Raf kinase activity and that Rheb expression inhibits B-Raf kinase activity. We also found that Rheb farnesylation, which is required for activation of mTOR by Rheb, is not required for inhibition of B-Raf by Rheb. Importantly inhibition of B-Raf by Rheb is mTOR-independent unlike activation of S6K by Rheb. The mTOR independence of inhibition of B-Raf kinase by Rheb has potential therapeutic implications for TSC patients in whom clinical trials using the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin are underway. Cells, Constructs, siRNA, and Antibodies—The ELT3 cell line (a gift of Dr. Cheryl Walker) was derived from an Eker rat uterine leiomyoma and lacks tuberin expression (34Howe S.R. Gottardis M.M. Everitt J.I. Goldsworthy T.L. Wolf D.C. Walker C. Am. J. Pathol. 1995; 146: 1568-1579PubMed Google Scholar). From ELT3 cells, we previously developed the T3 cell line with stable expression of TSC2 and the V3 vector control-expressing cell line (13Astrinidis A. Cash T.P. Hunter D.S. Walker C.L. Chernoff J. Henske E.P. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 8470-8476Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). For transient expression, ELT3 cells were retrovirally transduced with GFP as a control, full-length human TSC2, or the N1643K mutant form of TSC2. For retroviral production, GP-293 cells were co-transfected with the respective retroviral construct in the pMSCVneo vector (Clontech) and pVSV-G (Clontech) encoding for the viral glycoprotein using LipofectAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen). Replication-deficient retroviruses were collected from the culture after 72 h and applied to subconfluent ELT3 cells in the presence of 8 μg/ml Polybrene (Sigma). The transfection efficiency was about 60% as estimated by GFP fluorescence. Where indicated, cells were treated with 20 nm rapamycin (Biomol Research Laboratories, Plymouth Meeting, PA). The Rheb cDNA was purchased from Open Biosystems (Huntsville, AL). Rheb mutants Q64L and C182S and double mutant Q64L/C182S and B-Raf kinase mutants V599E (T1796A), artificially active B-Raf (T598E/S601D), and inactive B-Raf (T598A/S601A) were generated by site-directed mutagenesis using QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA), and sequences were fully confirmed. The Ras cDNA was purchased from Upstate Biotechnology (Lake Placid, NY). For siRNA down-regulation of TSC2, cells were transfected with a 100 nm concentration of either TSC2 SMARTpool siRNA or nonspecific control siRNA (both from Dharmacon, Lafayette, CO) using Mirus Trans-IT TKO transfection reagent (Mirus, Madison, WI). The following antibodies were used: anti-tuberin C20 and anti-Rheb C19 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA); anti-hamartin (3Plank T.L. Yeung R.S. Henske E.P. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 4766-4770PubMed Google Scholar); anti-phospho-Thr389-p70S6K, anti-p70S6K, anti-phospho-Ser235/236 S6 ribosomal protein, anti-S6 ribosomal protein, anti-Myc, anti-p44/42 MAPK, and anti-phospho-Thr202/Tyr204-p42/44 MAPK (Cell Signaling, Beverly, MA); anti-6XHisG (Invitrogen); and anti-B-Raf (Upstate Biotechnology). Measurement of in Vivo Rheb Activation—The measurement of in vivo activation of endogenous Rheb was based on methods for measuring Ras activation (35Scheele J.S. Rhee J.M. Boss G.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1097-1100Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). After rapid cell lysis with extract buffer (35Scheele J.S. Rhee J.M. Boss G.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1097-1100Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) the lysates were incubated with Protein A-agarose beads and either anti-Rheb antibody C19 or goat IgG and then heated at 100 °C for 3 min to release bound nucleotides. Released GDP was converted to [32P]GTP using nucleoside 5′-diphosphate kinase (36Liu M.Y. Cai S. Espejo A. Bedford M.T. Walker C.L. Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 6475-6480PubMed Google Scholar) and [γ-32P]ATP. GTP was separated from ATP by TLC, and radioactivity was quantitated by liquid scintillation counting (35Scheele J.S. Rhee J.M. Boss G.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1097-1100Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). B-Raf in Vitro Kinase Assay—Cells were lysed in an ice-cold buffer containing 25 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 5 mm EDTA, 50 mm NaCl, 50 mm NaF, 30 mm Na4P2O7, 10% glycerol, 1% Nonidet P-40, and protease and phosphatase inhibitors after serum deprivation. B-Raf kinase activity was measured using either a coupled or a direct method. For the coupled method, immunoprecipitated B-Raf was incubated with recombinant MEK1, p42 MAPK, and the substrate myelin basic protein in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP. The reactions were spotted on P81 paper, which selectively binds phosphoproteins, and 32P incorporation was measured in a scintillation counter. In the direct method, immunoprecipitated B-Raf kinase was incubated with MEK1, which was then resolved using SDS-PAGE. 32P incorporation was visualized by autoradiography. In Vitro GAP Activity—GST-Rheb was purified from bacteria. The GAP assay was performed using the GAP assay kit (Cytoskeleton, Denver, CO). The immunoprecipitation of tuberin was performed using anti-tuberin C20 antibody in 1 ml of cold immunoprecipitation buffer (1% Triton X-100, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, pH 8.0, 0.2 mm sodium ortho-vanadate, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.5% Nonidet P-40). Immune complexes were washed two times with immunoprecipitation buffer and resuspended in 10 μlof buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 0.1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin). GST-Rheb was loaded with [γ-32P]GTP and incubated with equal amounts of immunoprecipitated wild-type or mutant tuberin at room temperature. After washing, the amount of remaining GTP-bound Rheb was determined by scintillation counting. Tuberin Positively Regulates the Phosphorylation of p42/44 MAPK—We found that V3 control cells have a low level of phosphorylation of p42/44 MAPK in serum deprivation conditions compared with the T3 tuberin-expressing cell line (Fig. 1A). Similar differences in the phosphorylation of p42/44 MAPK occurred in cells grown in serum (Fig. 1B). To confirm that these phosphorylation differences were not the result of clonal selection, TSC2 was transiently transduced in the parental ELT3 cell line. Increased p42/44 MAPK phosphorylation was again present in tuberin-expressing cells compared with GFP control transduction (Fig. 1A, right panel). Tuberin Expression Increases GDP-Rheb—We confirmed that tuberin regulates the activation state of endogenous Rheb in serum-deprived V3 and T3 cells by measuring the amount of immunoprecipitated Rheb in the GDP-bound state (31Im E. von Lintig F.C. Chen J. Zhuang S. Qui W. Chowdhury S. Worley P.F. Boss G.R. Pilz R.B. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 6356-6365Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 35Scheele J.S. Rhee J.M. Boss G.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1097-1100Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). The fraction of GDP-bound immunoprecipitated Rheb in V3 cells was significantly lower (0.64 ± 0.02 fmol/mg of protein) compared with tuberin-expressing T3 cells (1.08 ± 0.09 fmol/mg of protein) (Fig. 2A). The fraction of GDP-bound endogenous Rheb was also significantly higher in ELT3 cells with transient expression of TSC2 compared with GFP control (Fig. 2A, right panel). Tuberin Increases B-Raf Kinase Activity—Rheb was previously shown to inhibit B-Raf kinase (31Im E. von Lintig F.C. Chen J. Zhuang S. Qui W. Chowdhury S. Worley P.F. Boss G.R. Pilz R.B. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 6356-6365Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Therefore, we asked whether B-Raf kinase activity was higher in tuberin-expressing cells compared with tuberin-deficient cells. Endogenous B-Raf kinase was immunoprecipitated from V3 and T3 cells, and its activity was measured using a coupled assay with myelin basic protein as the final substrate. Endogenous B-Raf kinase activity was higher in T3 tuberin-expressing cells compared with V3 cells (Fig. 2B). We next determined whether tuberin containing the patient-derived GAP domain mutation N1643K is defective in GAP activity toward Rheb. Rheb was loaded with [γ-32P]GTP and incubated with immunoprecipitated wild-type tuberin or N1643K tuberin. Tuberin reduced the GTP-Rheb level by about 40% after 15 min and 50% after 30 min (Fig. 2C), while a similar amount of immunoprecipitated N1643K tuberin did not decrease the Rheb-GTP levels. These data are consistent with the results of Garami et al. (29Garami A. Zwartkruis F.J. Nobukuni T. Joaquin M. Roccio M. Stocker H. Kozma S.C. Hafen E. Bos J.L. Thomas G. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 1457-1466Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (825) Google Scholar), who found that the expression of N1643K tuberin in COS7 cells did not increase Rheb-GDP levels. Our GAP assay was performed using only immunoprecipitated tuberin. In contrast, Tee et al. (27Tee A.R. Manning B.D. Roux P.P. Cantley L.C. Blenis J. Curr. Biol. 2003; 13: 1259-1268Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (924) Google Scholar) incubated Rheb with immunoprecipitated tuberin and hamartin and found that hamartin substantially enhances the GAP activity of tuberin. In ELT3 cells, transient expression of N1643K tuberin did not increase B-Raf kinase activity (Fig. 2D). Furthermore expression of Rheb in HEK293 cells inhibited endogenous B-Raf kinase activity (Fig. 2E), confirming the previous work of Im et al. (31Im E. von Lintig F.C. Chen J. Zhuang S. Qui W. Chowdhury S. Worley P.F. Boss G.R. Pilz R.B. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 6356-6365Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar), and expression of tuberin and hamartin attenuated inhibition of B-Raf by Rheb (Fig. 2E). Taken together, these data indicate that Rheb mediates activation of B-Raf by tuberin. Down-regulation of Tuberin with siRNA Decreases B-Raf Kinase Activity—To verify that tuberin regulates the activity of B-Raf at endogenous expression levels, tuberin was down-regulated in HEK293 cells using siRNA. Tuberin down-regulation decreased the phosphorylation of p42/44 MAPK and decreased the activity of endogenous B-Raf (Fig. 3) consistent with the increase in phospho-MAPK and B-Raf kinase activity with tuberin expression in Figs. 1 and 2. The phosphorylation of ribosomal protein S6 was increased when tuberin was down-regulated as expected. Rheb Inhibits the B-Raf-induced Phosphorylation of p42/44 MAPK—Expression of Rheb in cells expressing endogenous levels of B-Raf had no consistent effect on the phosphorylation of endogenous p42/44 MAPK (not shown). However, when wild-type B-Raf kinase was overexpressed, co-expression of Rheb decreased both the activity of B-Raf kinase and the B-Raf-induced phosphorylation of p42/44 MAPK (Fig. 4A). When serum-deprived cells were stimulated for 15 min with 20% fetal bovine serum, inhibition of p42/44 MAPK phosphorylation by Rheb was much less pronounced (Fig. 4B). In contrast, when cells were grown in serum-starved conditions or continuously in serum, Rheb strongly inhibited the phosphorylation of p42/44 MAPK (Fig. 4C). These data suggest that the relative expression level of B-Raf and the base-line activation of p42/44 MAPK by serum or other factors determine whether inhibition of B-Raf by Rheb can be detected using p42/44 MAPK as a readout and may explain in part why other investigators have not observed an effect of tuberin or Rheb on p42/44 MAPK signaling (27Tee A.R.

We next co-expressed Rheb with each of four different forms of B-Raf: wild-type; T598E/S601D, which is constitutively active (37Zhang B.H. Guan K.L. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5429-5439Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar); V599E, the B-Raf mutation that has been identified in melanoma and other cancers and has elevated kinase activity (38Davies H.

EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5429-5439Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar), which is inactive. Rheb inhibited the phosphorylation of p42/44 MAPK induced by wild-type B-Raf but not that induced by T598E/S601D or V599E (Fig. 4D). This demonstrates that Rheb cannot inhibit constitutively active forms of B-Raf. Rheb Farnesylation Is Required for mTOR Activation but Not for B-Raf Inhibition—We tested three mutant forms of Rheb: Rheb Q64L (39Clark G.J. Kinch M.S. Rogers-Graham K. Sebti S.M. Hamilton A.D. Der C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10608-10615Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar), which is predicted to have constitutive activity based on homology to the constitutively active Ras Q61L mutation; Rheb C182S, which is farnesylation-deficient; and Rheb Q64L/C182S, which is predicted to be dominantly inhibitory based on homology to Ras (40Stacey D.W. Feig L.A. Gibbs J.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 4053-4064Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). As expected, expression of Q64L Rheb alone increased the phosphorylation of S6 and S6K (28Inoki K. Li Y. Xu T. Guan K.L. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 1829-1834Crossref PubMed Scopus (1378) Google Scholar, 30Castro A.F. Rebhun J.F. Clark G.J. Quilliam L.A. J. Biol.

Co-expression of Q64L Rheb and B-Raf decreased the B-Raf-induced phosphorylation of p42/44 MAPK by 80% (Fig. 5A). The farnesylation mutant C182S migrated slightly above the other forms of Rheb as seen by other groups (27Tee A.R. Manning B.D. Roux P.P. Cantley L.C. Blenis J. Curr. Biol. 2003; 13: 1259-1268Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (924) Google Scholar, 41Urano J. Tabancay A.P. Yang W. Tamanoi F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 11198-11206Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Expression of C182S Rheb alone did not increase the phosphorylation of S6, confirming the work of Tee et al. (27Tee A.R. Manning B.D. Roux P.P. Cantley L.C. Blenis J. Curr. Biol. 2003; 13: 1259-1268Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (924) Google Scholar) and indicating that farnesylation is required for Rheb to activate mTOR. Importantly, however, C182S Rheb blocked the B-Raf-induced phosphorylation of MAPK by 60%, indicating that farnesylation of Rheb is not required for B-Raf inhibition. Expression of the Q64L/C182S Rheb also decreased the phosphorylation of p42/44 MAPK but did not activate the phosphorylation of S6, again consistent with the hypothesis that farnesylation is required for mTOR activation but not for B-Raf inhibition. The fact that the Q64L/C182S did not function as a dominant negative distinguishes Rheb from Ras for which constitutive active farnesylation mutants act as dominant negatives (40Stacey D.W. Feig L.A. Gibbs J.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 4053-4064Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Rheb Farnesylation Is Not Required for Interaction with B-Raf—An interaction between B-Raf and Rheb has been shown previously by in vitro binding studies (42Yee W.M. Worley P.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 921-933Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) and by co-immunoprecipitation (31Im E. von Lintig F.C. Chen J. Zhuang S. Qui W. Chowdhury S. Worley P.F. Boss G.R. Pilz R.B. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 6356-6365Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). To determine whether farnesylation is required for interaction of B-Raf with Rheb, we co-expressed Myc-tagged wild-type Rheb and wild-type B-Raf. As shown in Fig. 5B, Myc-Rheb co-immunoprecipitated with B-Raf, and B-Raf co-immunoprecipitated with Myc-Rheb, confirming the earlier studies. We found that the farnesylation-deficient forms of Rheb (C182S Rheb and Q64L/C182S Rheb) also co-immunoprecipitated with B-Raf, indicating that Rheb does not require farnesylation for its interaction with B-Raf. The Interaction of Endogenous Rheb and B-Raf Is Enhanced by Serum and by Ras Expression—We also found that endogenous B-Raf co-immunoprecipitated with endogenous Rheb (Fig. 5C), further supporting a model in which inhibition of B-Raf by Rheb is direct. The endogenous interaction was enhanced ∼2-fold in serum-stimulated cells (Fig. 5C) and in cells in which wild-type H-Ras was overexpressed (Fig. 5D). This suggests that the interaction between Rheb and B-Raf is regulated by growth factor signaling pathways. The increased interaction between Rheb and B-Raf when Ras is overexpressed could be linked to the ability of Rheb to inhibit Ras-induced transformation of NIH3T3 cells (39Clark G.J. Kinch M.S. Rogers-Graham K. Sebti S.M. Hamilton A.D. Der C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10608-10615Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). We were not able to detect Rheb in B-Raf immunoprecipitates at endogenous expression levels under basal, serum-stimulated, or H-Ras overexpression conditions using either the Upstate Biotechnology B-Raf antibody (07–453), which was generated against amino acids 754–765, or the Santa Cruz Biotechnology B-Raf antibody (SC-5284). The Santa Cruz Biotechnology antibody was substantially more efficient for B-Raf immunoprecipitation than the Upstate Biotechnology antibody. However, the Santa Cruz Biotechnology antibody was generated against amino acids 12–156 of B-Raf that overlap with the Ras binding domain and could therefore also interfere with Rheb binding. Inhibition of MAPK and B-Raf by Rheb Is mTOR-independent—These data demonstrate that Rheb inhibits the activation of p42/44 MAPK and B-Raf but do not exclude the possibility that this inhibition is partially downstream of mTOR. To determine whether inhibition of B-Raf kinase and p42/44 MAPK phosphorylation by Rheb is mTOR-independent, Rheb was co-expressed with B-Raf kinase in the absence or presence of 20 nm rapamycin, which is an mTOR inhibitor. As expected, rapamycin decreased the phosphorylation of S6K and S6. In contrast, rapamycin did not prevent Rheb from inhibiting p42/44 MAPK phosphorylation or B-Raf kinase activity (Fig. 6A). We conclude that inhibition of B-Raf kinase by Rheb is mTOR-independent as illustrated in the model in Fig. 6B. Here we report that tuberin increases the activity of B-Raf kinase and the phosphorylation of p42/44 MAPK, while Rheb decreases the activity of B-Raf kinase and the phosphorylation of p42/44 MAPK. We observed these effects in tuberin-deficient ELT3 cells in which tuberin was re-expressed and saw reciprocal effects in HEK293 cells in which tuberin was down-regulated with siRNA. In contrast to our data, other groups have not observed effects of tuberin expression on p42/44 MAPK and have concluded that Rheb does not regulate p42/44 MAPK signaling (27Tee A.R. Manning B.D. Roux P.P. Cantley L.C. Blenis J. Curr. Biol. 2003; 13: 1259-1268Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (924) Google Scholar, 29Garami A. Zwartkruis F.J. Nobukuni T. Joaquin M. Roccio M. Stocker H. Kozma S.C. Hafen E. Bos J.L. Thomas G. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 1457-1466Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (825) Google Scholar). We suspect that this apparent discrepancy is in part the consequence of measuring downstream targets of B-Raf kinase that are also downstream of C-Raf/Raf-1 rather than B-Raf kinase activity itself. Garami et al. (29Garami A. Zwartkruis F.J. Nobukuni T. Joaquin M. Roccio M. Stocker H. Kozma S.C. Hafen E. Bos J.L. Thomas G. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 1457-1466Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (825) Google Scholar) found that Rheb expression did not inhibit serum activation of overexpressed p44 MAPK, and Tee et al. (27Tee A.R. Manning B.D. Roux P.P. Cantley L.C. Blenis J. Curr. Biol. 2003; 13: 1259-1268Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (924) Google Scholar) found that Rheb expression did not inhibit epidermal growth factor-induced activation of overexpressed ribosomal S6K1, a downstream target of p42/44 MAPK. In HEK293 cells, despite the fact that we consistently detected activation of endogenous B-Raf kinase by tuberin and inhibition of endogenous B-Raf kinase by Rheb, we did not detect differences in the phosphorylation of p42/44 MAPK unless B-Raf kinase was overexpressed. In addition, the inhibitory effects of Rheb on B-Raf as detected using p42/44 MAPK or other downstream targets as a readout may be difficult to detect after serum or epidermal growth factor stimulation when p42/44 MAPK is strongly activated by C-Raf/Raf-1. Consistent with this notion, we found that the inhibitory effects of Rheb on the phosphorylation of p42/44 MAPK were greatly diminished when cells were stimulated with serum. Interestingly the inhibitory effect of Rheb on p42/44 MAPK was readily detected in cells grown in the continuous presence of serum. A final factor potentially influencing the conflicting data regarding activation of B-Raf by tuberin is that mouse embryonic fibroblasts are known to express extremely low levels of B-Raf and high levels of A-Raf and C-Raf/Raf-1 (43Mercer K. Chiloeches A. Huser M. Kiernan M. Marais R. Pritchard C. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 347-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 44Huser M. Luckett J. Chiloeches A. Mercer K. Iwobi M. Giblett S. Sun X.M. Brown J. Marais R. Pritchard C. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 1940-1951Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). This probably accounts for the inability of Zhang et al. (32Zhang H. Cicchetti G. Onda H. Koon H.B. Asrican K. Bajraszewski N. Vazquez F. Carpenter C.L. Kwiatkowski D.J. J. Clin. Investig. 2003; 112: 1223-1233Crossref PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar) to detect differences in the phosphorylation of MAPK in TSC2-null mouse embryonic fibroblasts compared with control mouse embryonic fibroblasts. None of these factors would account for the discrepancy between our data and that of Yoon et al. (33Yoon H.S. Ramachandiran S. Chacko M.A. Monks T.J. Lau S.S. Am. J. Physiol. 2004; 286: F417-F424Google Scholar), who found that tuberin re-expression decreased B-Raf activity in rat renal epithelial cell lines lacking tuberin. This could indicate that the impact of tuberin on B-Raf kinase is affected by other pathways mutated by quinol-thioether in these cells. We found that inhibition of B-Raf kinase by Rheb is mTOR-independent. At least one other mTOR-independent function of tuberin has been identified: in mammalian cells, tuberin regulates vascular endothelial growth factor through both mTOR-dependent and mTOR-independent mechanisms (45Brugarolas J.B. Vazquez F. Reddy A. Sellers W.R. Kaelin Jr., W.G. Cancer Cell. 2003; 4: 147-158Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar). Whether or not B-Raf mediates mTOR-independent regulation of vascular endothelial growth factor by tuberin is not known. It is intriguing that B-Raf-deficient mice die during embryogenesis of vascular defects including enlarged blood vessels with increased endothelial cell precursors (46Wojnowski L. Zimmer A.M. Beck T.W. Hahn H. Bernal R. Rapp U.R. Zimmer A. Nat. Genet. 1997; 16: 293-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar) because renal angiomyolipomas, which occur in most TSC patients, also have enlarged, abnormal blood vessels. An important distinction between signaling of Rheb to B-Raf and mTOR is the differential requirements for Rheb farnesylation. Rheb is known to be farnesylated (39Clark G.J. Kinch M.S. Rogers-Graham K. Sebti S.M. Hamilton A.D. Der C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10608-10615Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). We found, as did Tee et al. (27Tee A.R. Manning B.D. Roux P.P. Cantley L.C. Blenis J. Curr. Biol. 2003; 13: 1259-1268Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (924) Google Scholar), that the farnesyl mutant C182S Rheb was unable to activate S6K. Interestingly, however, C182S retains the ability to interact with B-Raf and inhibit p42/44 MAPK phosphorylation, indicating that farnesylation is not required for Rheb to inhibit p42/44 MAPK. This finding suggests that farnesyltransferase inhibition, a potential therapeutic strategy for TSC patients (27Tee A.R. Manning B.D. Roux P.P. Cantley L.C. Blenis J. Curr. Biol. 2003; 13: 1259-1268Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (924) Google Scholar), will not block all consequences of Rheb activation and further confirms that the effects of Rheb on mTOR/S6K and B-Raf/p42/44 MAPK are separable. Some of the clinical manifestations of TSC are associated with aberrant cellular differentiation, which could be the result of low levels of B-Raf activity in cells lacking tuberin. Renal angiomyolipomas contain vessels, smooth muscle cells, and fat. All three components arise from a common precursor cell indicating differentiation plasticity (17Karbowniczek M. Yu J. Henske E.P. Am. J. Pathol. 2003; 162: 491-500Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 47Niida Y. Stemmer-Rachamimov A.O. Logrip M. Tapon D. Perez R. Kwiatkowski D.J. Sims K. MacCollin M. Louis D.N. Ramesh V. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 2001; 69: 493-503Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). The neurons within cerebral cortical tubers in TSC also exhibit aberrant cellular differentiation (48Hirose T. Scheithauer B.W. Lopes M.B. Gerber H.A. Altermatt H.J. Hukee M.J. VandenBerg S.R. Charlesworth J.C. Acta Neuropathol. (Berl.). 1995; 90: 387-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). B-Raf is required for the neuronal differentiation of PC12 cells, suggesting another possible link between B-Raf signaling and the clinical manifestations of TSC. In conclusion, our data demonstrate for the first time that tuberin activates B-Raf and p42/44 MAPK, that inhibition of p42/44 MAPK by Rheb does not require farnesylation, and that inhibition of B-Raf and p42/44 MAPK by Rheb is mTOR-independent. The fact that cells lacking tuberin have decreased B-Raf kinase activity and decreased phosphorylation of p42/44 MAPK is somewhat surprising given the role of tuberin as a tumor suppressor gene and the role of B-Raf in positively regulating cell proliferation and differentiation. We hypothesize that dysregulated B-Raf kinase activity due to tuberin deficiency could lead to the aberrant cellular differentiation seen within some TSC tumors. In addition, altered neuronal differentiation could be linked to the neurologic manifestations of TSC, which include mental retardation and autism. The mTOR-independent functions of tuberin are of particular interest clinically because rapamycin is currently in clinical trials to determine its potential as a therapy for the renal and pulmonary manifestations of TSC. We are grateful to Drs. Al Knudson, Jon Chernoff, and Vladimir Khazak for critical review of this manuscript and to Dr. Cheryl Walker for the ELT3 cells."

Physiol. 2000; 440: 503-512Google Scholar). The heavy subunit is important for trafficking of the heterodimer to the plasma membrane, whereas the light subunit confers transport function and specificity. Two heavy subunits are known, 4F2hc and rBAT, which combine with a range of LSHATs to form several transport systems. 4F2hc heterodimerizes with xCT to elicit sodium-independent transport of anionic l-cysteine and l-glutamate by a 1:1 obligatory exchange (system x–c) (3Bassi M.T.

Chem. 1999; 274: 11455-11458Google Scholar). xCT is expressed in most cell lines, in activated macrophages and in the brain (4Sato H. Tamba M. Ishii T. Bannai S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11455-11458Google Scholar, 5Sato H. Tamba M. Kuriyama-Matsumura K. Okuno S. Bannai S. Antioxid. Redox. Signal. 2000; 2: 665-671Google Scholar). System x–c functions physiologically for cysteine uptake and glutamate efflux because of the low and high intracellular concentrations of cysteine and glutamate, respectively. Cytosolic concentrations of cysteine are kept low because of its rapid reduction to cysteine, the rate-limiting substrate for the synthesis of intracellular glutathione (4Sato H. Tamba M. Ishii T. Bannai S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11455-11458Google Scholar, 6Bannai S. Sato H. Ishii T. Sugita Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 18480-18484Google Scholar). Consistent with a role of xCT in cellular antioxidant defense, the xCT gene carries an electrophil response element that may mediate the up-regulation of system x–c activity by oxygen in macrophages and fibroblasts (5Sato H. Tamba M. Kuriyama-Matsumura K. Okuno S. Bannai S. Antioxid. Redox. Signal. 2000; 2: 665-671Google Scholar, 7Sasaki H. Sato H. Kuriyama-Matsumura K. Sato K. Maebara K. Wang H. Tamba M. Itoh K. Yamamoto M. Bannai S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 44765-44771Google Scholar). Moreover, system x–c in macrophages and microglia is envisaged as a mechanism for glutamate efflux potentially leading to excitotoxic neural injury in pathological states (5Sato H. Tamba M. Kuriyama-Matsumura K. Okuno S. Bannai S. Antioxid. Redox. Signal. 2000; 2: 665-671Google Scholar, 8Barger S.W. Basile A.S. J. Neurochem. 2001; 76: 846-854Google Scholar, 9Piani D. Fontana A. J. Immunol. 1994; 152: 3578-3585Google Scholar). Little is known of the protein structure or the structurefunction relationships of HATs. rBAT and 4F2hc are believed to be type II membrane glycoproteins with an intracellular N terminus, a single transmembrane domain, and a bulky (N-glycosylated) extracellular domain (1Chillaron J. Roca R. Valencia A. Zorzano A. Palacin M. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 281: F995-F1018Google Scholar). The N terminus of 4F2hc has a cytoplasmic location (10Fenczik C.A. Zent R. Dellos M. Calderwood D.A. Satriano J. Kelly C. Ginsberg M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 8746-8752Google Scholar). In contrast, LSHATs are not N-glycosylated and show a hydrophobicity profile suggesting 12 transmembrane domains. Reconstitution studies with the b0,+AT light subunit showed that the rBAT heavy subunit is not necessary for the basic transport function (11Reig N. Chillaron J. Bartoccioni P. Fernandez E. Bendahan A. Zorzano A. Kanner B. Palacin M. Bertran J. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 4906-4914Google Scholar). Then the relevant functional determinants should lie on the LSHATs. Our knowledge of the structure-function relationships of LSHATs rely on a few single residues. A naturally occurring interspecific change (W234L) slightly modified the Km of LAT1 (12Boado R.J. Li J.Y. Pardridge W.M. J. Neurochem. 2003; 84: 1322-1331Google Scholar). Among the mutations identified in y+LAT1 causing lysinuric protein intolerance (13Torrents D. Mykkanen J. Pineda M.

Finally, there is evidence that Cys327 lies close to the substrate binding site/permeation pathway of xCT (16Jimenez-Vidal M. Gasol E. Zorzano A. Nunes V. Palacin M. Chillaron J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 29: 11214-11221Google Scholar). To describe the membrane topology of LSHATs, we performed cysteine scanning accessibility studies using xCT as a model. Our results are compatible with 12 transmembrane domains and with intracellular N and C termini. Moreover, evidence is presented in support of a re-entrant loop between transmembrane domains 2 and 3, the accessibility of which is restricted by xCT substrates/inhibitor. Construction of the Cysteineless xCT and the Single Cysteine Mutants—The seven native cysteine residues of the wild-type transporter (residues 86, 158, 197, 271, 327, 414, and 435) were each replaced by serine (Cys-less xCT) by sequential site-directed mutagenesis (QuikChange™; Stratagene), using human xCT in pNKS2 as a template. The mutated regions were excised by digestion and subcloned back into the original plasmid. The Cys-less xCT was then subcloned by enzyme digestion into the pCDNA4 HisMax vector to insert a six-histidine tail at its N terminus (His-Cys-less). Single cysteine mutants were made in the same way by using His-Cys-less as a template. The mutations were confirmed by DNA sequencing with a d-Rhodamine dye Terminator Cycle Sequencing Ready Reaction kit (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) in an Abi Prism 377 DNA Sequencer. Cell Culture and Transfections in HeLa Cells—HeLa cells were cultured as described (11Reig N. Chillaron J. Bartoccioni P. Fernandez E. Bendahan A. Zorzano A. Kanner B. Palacin M. Bertran J. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 4906-4914Google Scholar) and grown at 37 or 33 °C, as indicated. Transient transfections were performed by standard calcium phosphate precipitation as described (15Font M.A. Feliubadalo L. Estivill X. Nunes V. Golomb E. Kreiss Y. Pras E. Bisceglia L. d'Adamo A.P.

The green fluorescence protein-encoding plasmid was included to monitor transfection efficiencies, which ranged from 70 to 90% as assessed by fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis for BM labeling and transport assay experiments. Transport Measurements—Transient transfected HeLa cells were cultured in 24-well plates. 48 h later, influx rates of 25 μm l-[35S]cysteine (Amersham Biosciences) and 50 μm l-[3H]glutamate (American Radiolabeled Chemicals) were measured for 45 s (linear conditions) as described previously (15Font M.A. Feliubadalo L.

Induced transport values were calculated by subtracting transport in mock transfected cells (i.e. empty pCDNA3-transfected cells). Each independent experiment was performed with 4–6 replicates. Efflux measurements were performed as described in the legend to Supplemental Fig. A. Nonradioactive amino acids and chemicals were purchased from Sigma. Labeling with BM and Purification on Ni-NTA Beads—Labeling with 500 μm BM was carried out as described previously (17Grunewald M. Bendahan A. Kanner B.I. Neuron. 1998; 21: 623-632Google Scholar), with the following modifications. After the biotinylation step, the cells were lysed with 100 μl/well of a solution containing 0.3 m NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 0.025 m imidazole, protease inhibitor mixture (phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, aprotinin, leupeptin, and pepstatin), and 0.05 m NaPO4 (pH 7.4). The cells were scraped, transferred into a 1.5-ml tube, and incubated on a rotating orbital. After 30 min, the insoluble material was removed by centrifugation at 12,000 rpm for 10 min. The supernatants were incubated with 20 μl of Ni-NTA-agarose beads (Qiagen) preequilibrated in 150 μl of lysis solution for 30 min at 4 °C. After 1.5 h of incubation at 4 °C with the solubilized cellular proteins, the beads were washed twice in 750 μl of a PBS solution containing 0.5 m NaCl and 0.05 m imidazole (pH 7.4). The proteins were eluted with 45 μl of elution buffer (PBS solution containing 0.5 m NaCl and 0.25 m imidazole, pH 7.4) after 15 min of shaking incubation at room temperature. When indicated, the cells were permeabilized with streptolysin O (SLO) (Sigma) immediately before the biotinylation step, as described (17Grunewald M. Bendahan A. Kanner B.I. Neuron. 1998; 21: 623-632Google Scholar). The SLO buffer, as recommended by the supplier, was 10 mm phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) supplemented with 1 mm dithiothreitol. 4-fold concentrated SDS-PAGE loading buffer and 100 mm dithiothreitol were added to the eluates from the Ni-NTA beads. After SDS-PAGE, the eluates were transferred onto nitrocellulose, and the biotinylated proteins were detected by using streptavidin-peroxidase (Roche Applied Science) and ECL (Amersham Biosciences) according to the instructions of the manufacturer. For each of the mutants, biotinylation was performed at least three times. Densitometries were carried out with the program Gene Tools from Syngene. Effect of MTS Reagents on Transport—HeLa cells were transfected with the indicated plasmid and cultured in 24-well plates. 48 h later the cells were incubated for 5 min at room temperature with uptake solution without amino acid (137 mm methyl gluconate, 2.8 mm CaCl2, 1.2 mm MgSO4, 5.4 mm KCl, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.5) containing the indicated concentrations of MTSET, MTSEA, or MTSES. For protection assays, unlabeled l-cysteine, l-glutamate, or l-arginine was added to 10 mm MTSES solution. Then cells were washed three times with uptake solution (without amino acid) and subsequently assayed for transport activity. For substrate-protection dependence curves, MTSES was used at 1 mm for 10 min of incubation time in the presence of a range of l-glutamate or l-cysteine concentrations. MTS reagents (Toronto Research Chemicals) were dissolved as a 1 mm stock solution in Me2SO. After dilution in the medium to the final concentration, the reagents were used immediately. Immunofluorescence Microscopy—HeLa cells were transfected on cover slides (Marienfeld) with the indicated plasmid and 2 μg of pEGFP (Clontech). After 48 h, the cells were fixed with 3% paraformaldehyde in PBS solution and permeabilized for 10 min with PBS with 0.1% Triton X-100. After 30 min of incubation with 1% bovine serum albumin, each cover slide was incubated for 1 h at room temperature with anti-Xpress antibody (Invitrogen), diluted 1:100 in PBS containing 20 mm glycine and 1% bovine serum albumin. The slides were washed twice in PBS-glycine and incubated for 45 min at room temperature with Texas Red-conjugated goat anti-mouse (Molecular Probes), diluted 1:100. After two washes in PBS, the slides were mounted on microscope slides (Menzel-Glaser) with mowiol. The images were obtained from the Leica TCS NT confocal microscope, at the Scientific Services of the Barcelona Science Park (Fig. 1). Transfection efficiencies in these experiments (i.e. green fluorescence protein signal) ranged from 50 to 70%. Western Blot Analysis of His-tagged xCT—Eluates from the purification on Ni-NTA beads containing 4-fold concentrated SDS-PAGE loading buffer and 100 mm dithiothreitol were loaded for SDS-PAGE (10% polyacrylamide) and transferred onto Immobilon (Millipore Iberica). The membranes were blocked with 3% bovine serum albumin in Tris-buffered saline (0.05 m Tris-HCl, 0.15 m NaCl, pH 7.5) for 1 h at 37 °C. Anti-Xpress antibody (Invitrogen) was used at a 1:5000 dilution in 1% bovine serum albumin and 0.05% Tween 20 in Tris-buffered saline, according to the manufacturer's instructions. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse antibody (Sigma) was used as a secondary antibody at 1:50,000 dilution. Antibody bonding was detected using ECL Western blot detection system (Amersham Biosciences). Oocyte Dixon Plot and Efflux Studies—Oocyte origin, management, cRNA synthesis, and injections were as described elsewhere (18Bertran J. Werner A. Moore M.L. Stange G. Markovich D. Biber J. Testar X. Zorzano A. Palacin M. Murer H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 5601-5605Google Scholar). Dixon plot of 4-S-CPG inhibition of transport and efflux determination via 4F2hc/xCT were performed as described in the legends to Supplemental Figs. C and D. Kinetic Data Analysis—Nonlinear regression fits of experimental and calculated data to estimate Vmax and Km (Michaelis-Menten equation), half-life times (t½) for transporter inactivation, IC50 values for substrate protection, and Ki for 4-S-CPG were performed with GraphPad Prism as described (16Jimenez-Vidal M. Gasol E. Zorzano A. Nunes V. Palacin M. Chillaron J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 29: 11214-11221Google Scholar). Localization of the N and C Termini of xCT—Two tagged versions of xCT were constructed, His-xCT (i.e. His-Xpress at the N terminus) and xCT-myc (i.e. myc at the C terminus). Transfection of human His-xCT alone or in combination with human 4F2hc resulted in the induction of both 50 μm l-[3H] glutamate (4-fold) and 25 μm l-[35S] cysteine (6-fold) uptake over background (Supplemental Fig. A). The His-xCT-induced transport was similar to that elicited by nontagged xCT (88 ± 9 and 84 ± 7% of the transport of 25 μm l-[35S]cysteine and 50 μm l-[3H]glutamate in nontagged xCT-transfected cells, respectively; data not shown; n = 5 independent experiments). The characteristics of the His-xCT-induced transport agree with those obtained previously with wild-type xCT and 4F2hc (3Bassi M.T. Gasol E. Manzoni M. Pineda M. Riboni M. Martin R. Zorzano A.

Similarly, xCT-myc also elicited system x–c transport activity (4-fold of 25 μm l-[35S]cysteine over background, representing 67 ± 7% of the untagged transporter; n = 8). Tag immunodetection of His-xCT and xCT-myc occurred only when the cells were permeabilized (Fig. 1). In this case, in addition to intracellular signal, a clear label of the plasma membrane was obtained. This strongly supports the intracellular location of both ends of xCT.Table IKinetic parameters of xCT mutantsGlutamateCysteineKmVmaxKmVmaxμmpmol/min·mg proteinμmpmol/min·mg proteinHis-xCT224 ± 78 (4)6087 ± 897110 ± 19 (3)9597 ± 886His-H110C192 ± 53 (4)5654 ± 199789 ± 36 (3)7665 ± 1360His-H110D154 ± 41 (1)8121 ± 59985 ± 27 (1)12696 ± 1411His-H110KNDNDHis-Cys-less827 ± 171 (1)5073 ± 356117 ± 41 (1)8709 ± 1165His-H110C-Cys-less1036 ± 144 (1)10365 ± 544143 ± 46 (2)9960 ± 1456 Open table in a new tab HeLa cells express 4F2hc and are devoid of rBAT expression (11Reig N. Chillaron J. Bartoccioni P. Fernandez E. Bendahan A. Zorzano A. Kanner B. Palacin M. Bertran J. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 4906-4914Google Scholar). This suggests that endogenous 4F2hc drives transfected xCT to the plasma membrane. This is in agreement with previous results obtained in HeLa cells for asc-1 2M. Pineda and M. Palacín, unpublished results. and xCT in NIH3T3 cells (19Wang H. Tamba M. Kimata M. Sakamoto K. Bannai S. Sato H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 305: 611-618Google Scholar), where transfection of the corresponding LSHAT alone resulted in full transport activity in the plasma membrane. For simplicity in the rest of experiments, the cells were transfected with the corresponding wild-type, tagged, or mutated human xCT versions alone. Biotinylation of Single Cysteine xCT Subunit—To study the membrane topology of human xCT, a cysteine accessibility strategy was performed (17Grunewald M. Bendahan A. Kanner B.I. Neuron. 1998; 21: 623-632Google Scholar). An N-terminal His-tagged cysteineless xCT (His-Cys-less) was obtained by mutating the 7 endogenous cysteine residues to serine. His-Cys-less showed transport characteristics similar to those of wild-type xCT. In cells grown at 33 °C to increase transport induction, as learned with rBAT/b0,+AT (20Pineda M. Wagner C.A. Broer A. Stehberger P.A. Kaltenbach S. Gelpi J.L. Martin D.R. Zorzano A. Palacin M. Lang F. Broer S. Biochem. J. 2004; 377: 665-674Google Scholar), 25 μm l-[35S] cysteine xCT-induced transport was 3065 ± 142 pmol/mg protein min in His-xCT-transfected cells and 1045 ± 75 pmol/mg protein min in His-Cys-less-transfected cells (i.e. 34% ± 5% of His-xCT) (n = 8). This represents 7.6- and 3.3-fold transport activity over background conditions (462 ± 50 pmol/mg protein min in mock-transfected cells; n = 8) in His-xCT- and His-Cys-less-transfected cells respectively. His-Cys-less showed similar apparent Km for cysteine and 3.6-fold higher apparent Km for glutamate than His-xCT (Table I). Mutation of cysteine residue 327 to serine is responsible for the increased glutamate Km (16Jimenez-Vidal M. Gasol E. Zorzano A. Nunes V. Palacin M. Chillaron J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 29: 11214-11221Google Scholar). Therefore, we have used His-Cys-less as the basis for the topology determination. Fig. 2 shows the positions where single cysteine residues were introduced in His-Cys-less and the transport activity of l-[35S]cysteine induced upon transfection in HeLa cells. Single cysteine mutants with transport activities below 25% of His-Cys-less were not considered for further studies. A typical experiment, in which biotinylated xCT derivatives are visualized, is shown in Fig. 3A. HeLa cells expressing the xCT constructs were reacted with BM. After solubilization of the membrane proteins, the His-tagged transporters were purified on Ni-NTA beads. The covalently bound biotin was readily visualized after SDS-PAGE in reducing conditions by probing the blotted proteins with streptavidin peroxidase. The biotinylated His-tagged xCT (His-xCT) ran as a band around 40 kDa, which is consistent with the mobility of immunodetected His-xCT (Fig. 3B). Other labeled bands are not specific because they were detected in nontagged xCT-transfected cells (data not shown) and in His-Cys-less. Preincubation of the cells expressing His-xCT with the membrane-impermeable sulfhydryl reagent MTSET (21Karlin A. Akabas M.H. Methods Enzymol. 1998; 293: 123-145Google Scholar) blocked biotinylation only partially. This suggests that some of the seven endogenous cysteines are accessible from the external medium (i.e. MTSET-sensitive label), whereas others are accessible to the slightly permeable BM, suggesting access to the internal milieu. As shown in Fig. 3B, overexpressed His-xCT showed another faint band of ∼80 kDa, representing most probably a homodimer. This dimerization in reducing SDS-PAGE has been previously reported for other LSHATs (e.g. b0,+AT; Refs. 14Feliubadalo L. Font M. Purroy J. Rousaud F. Estivill X. Nunes V. Golomb E. Centola M. Aksentijevich I. Kreiss Y. Goldman B. Pras M. Kastner D.L. Pras E. Gasparini P. Bisceglia L. Beccia E. Gallucci M. de Sanctis L. Ponzone A. Rizzoni G.F. Zelante L. Bassi M.T. George Jr., A.L. Palacin M. Nat. Genet. 1999; 23: 52-57Google Scholar and 22Fernandez E. Carrascal M. Rousaud F. Abian J. Zorzano A. Palacin M. Chillaron J. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 283: F540-F548Google Scholar). Biotinylation of the ∼80-kDa band was not detected, most probably because of the low expression of this band and the presence of nonspecific biotinylated bands in this mobility range. When Leu163 was replaced by cysteine (in His-Cys-less background), biotinylation was again apparent as a specific ∼40-kDa band. Preincubation with MTSET completely blocked this biotinylation. This suggests that the cysteine introduced at the 163 position is accessible from the external medium. In contrast, cysteine residues introduced at positions 187 (S187C) or 260 (E260C) did not result in biotinylation of the 40-kDa band. This lack of biotinylation seems not to be due to a loss of expression of the mutants as they showed significant transport activity (Fig. 2). When SLO was used to permeabilize HeLa cells expressing E260C, the transporter became biotinylated (Fig. 3A). In this case, preincubation with the highly membrane permeable N-ethylmaleimide blocked this biotinylation. As expected, SLO permeabilization did not increase biotinylation of the externally located residue 163 (E163C) (data not shown). This suggests that the cysteine introduced at the 260 position is accessible from the inside. In contrast, S187C was not biotinylated after SLO (Fig. 3A). This negative result is ambiguous; it may mean that this residue is located in hydrophobic surroundings within the membrane, is facing an aqueous access channel too narrow to be accessible to the bulky BM, or is hidden within a particular secondary structure of the xCT transporter or by interacting proteins (e.g. the heavy subunit 4F2hc). Biotinylation of two bands around ∼80 kDa (Fig. 3A) is unspecific because biotinylation of these bands are also visible in nontagged xCT- and His-Cys-less-transfected cells (data not shown). Biotinylation Screening to Establish the Membrane Topology of xCT Subunit—To identify the membrane topology of additional sites, we introduced single cysteines at many other positions of His-Cys-less. Fig. 4A shows a 12-transmembrane domain model of xCT based on the HMMTOP algorithm (23Tusnady G.E. Simon I. Bioinformatics. 2001; 17: 849-850Google Scholar). Residues with an expected extracellular location at positions Asn72 (EL1–2), Leu163 (already shown in Fig. 3A), Gln219 (EL5–6), Ala294 (EL7–8), Ser387 (EL9–10), and Ser445 (EL11–12) when mutated to cysteine showed biotinylation, which was blocked by MTSET (Fig. 4B). This showed that these residues are accessible from the external medium, as expected. Fig. 4C shows biotinylation of residues expected to be located inside (Fig. 4A). Positions Ser11 (N terminus), Thr102 (IL2–3), Ser181 and Phe193 (IL4–5), Glu260 (IL6–7; also shown in Fig. 3A), Glu353 and His363 (IL8–9), His418 (IL10–11), and Asp499 (C terminus) when mutated to cysteine become strongly biotinylated only after permeabilization with SLO. Moreover, N-ethylmaleimide blocked biotinylation of these residues. Several residues (S11C, T102C, E260C, H363C, H418C, and D499C) showed slight biotinylation without permeabilization. This is most probably due to the fact that BM has some permeability through the plasma membrane (17Grunewald M. Bendahan A. Kanner B.I. Neuron. 1998; 21: 623-632Google Scholar). Indeed, this biotinylation was MTSET-insensitive (data not shown), and biotinylation increased strongly after permeabilization with SLO. This shows that all these residues are accessible from inside. Biotinylation of residues within putative IL4–5 was difficult. Thus, in addition to the intracellularly accessible residues Ser181 and Phe193, other residues within this loop (Ile182, Ser185, Ser187 (Fig. 3A), Ala188, Ile190, and Ile192) showed no biotinylation even after permeabilization (data not shown). The inside location of the N and C terminus suggested by the biotinylation studies confirms the immunofluorescence results shown in Fig. 1. Finally, residues predicted to be located within transmembrane domains (Lys166 in transmembrane domain 4, Cys197 in transmembrane domains 5, and Cys327 and Ala337 in transmembrane domain 8) showed no biotinylation even after permeabilization with SLO (data not shown). In all, these results give experimental support to the 12-transmembrane domain model of xCT. Biotinylation of Single Cysteine Residues within IL2–3—Mutant H110C showed biotinylation from the external medium (biotinylation is blocked by the membrane impermeable MTSES; Fig. 5), whereas the neighboring residue Thr102 (mutant T102C) showed biotinylation from inside (Fig. 4C). This fostered more extensive screening of the intracellular loop 2–3 (Fig. 4C). Residues Thr102 and Glu116, flanking position His110 at 6 or 8 residues, showed biotinylation from inside. This suggests a re-entrant loop-like structure within IL2–3. One of the closest His110-flanking positions, G109C showed biotinylation only after permeabilization with SLO (Fig. 4C). The other closest flanking position, Tyr111, is a fully conserved residue (Supplemental Fig. E), which when mutated to cysteine resulted in very little transport activity (Fig. 2) and mistrafficking to the plasma membrane (Supplemental Fig. B). Other positions within IL2–3 gave no"

CNF1 acts at the molecular level by constitutively activating Rho GTPases attenuated by their cellular ubiquitin-mediated proteasomal degradation. Here we report the relationship between the ubiquitin-mediated proteasomal degradation of activated Rho and the endothelial cell response to the toxin. The type of cellular response to CNF1 intoxication, first screened by DNA microarray analysis, revealed the launching of a program oriented toward an inflammatory response. Parallel to Rho protein activation by CNF1, we also established the kinetics of production of monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1), interleukin-8 (IL-8), IL-6, monocyte inflammatory protein-3α (MIP-3α) and E-selectin. Both the mutation of the catalytic domain of the toxin (CNF1-C866S) and the inhibition of Rho proteins abrogate the CNF1-induced production of the immunomodulators MIP-3α, MCP-1, and IL-8. These immunomodulators are also produced upon activation of Cdc42 and Rac preferentially. Our results indicate that, in addition to pathogen molecular pattern recognition by host-receptors, a direct activation of Rho proteins by the CNF1 virulence factor efficiently triggers a cellular reaction of host alert.

Progress has been made in unraveling the molecular mechanisms of action of bacterial virulence factors, as well as the signal transduction cascades leading to host innate and adaptive immune responses. Studies on host-pathogen interactions are beginning to provide an integrated view of bacterial requirements for successful infection. This is particularly true for a large family of bacterial virulence factors and toxins targeting cellular Rho proteins (1Boquet P. Lemichez E. Trends Cell Biol. 2003; 13: 238-246Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). These bacterial factors either activate or inactivate cellular Rho proteins.

Cell Microbiol. 2000; 2: 187-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Rho proteins are essential regulatory molecules, controlling the actin cytoskeleton organization and dynamic. They act to fine-tune the cell, reshaping it during cell polarity, movement, differentiation, and phagocytosis (4Takai Y. Sasaki T. Matozaki T. Physiol. Rev. 2001; 81: 153-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (2061) Google Scholar, 5Etienne-Manneville S. Hall A. Nature. 2002; 420: 629-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (3854) Google Scholar, 6Chimini G. Chavrier P. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 191-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). In addition, they interfere with a variety of signaling pathways controlling gene transcription (7Bishop A.L. Hall A. Biochem. J. 2000; 348: 241-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (1676) Google Scholar). For instance, Rac and Cdc42 are activated down-stream of the Toll-like receptor-2, implicated in Gram-positive pathogen-associated molecular pattern recognition (8Arbibe L. Mira J.P. Teusch N. Kline L. Guha M. Mackman N. Godowski P.J. Ulevitch R.J. Knaus U.G. Nat. Immunol. 2000; 1: 533-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (568) Google Scholar, 9Medzhitov R. Janeway C.A. Science. 2002; 296: 298-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (1672) Google Scholar). Another example of the relationship between Rho proteins and the host defenses is the Rac/Cdc42-dependent formation of a supramolecular activation complex or “immunological synapse” crucial for lymphocyte activation (10Krawczyk C. Penninger J.M. Trends Cell Biol. 2001; 11: 212-220Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). In addition, both Rac1 and Rac2 are required for B-cell development and maintenance (11Walmsley M.J. Ooi S.K. Reynolds L.F. Smith S.H. Ruf S. Mathiot A. Vanes L. Williams D.A. Cancro M.P. Tybulewicz V.L. Science. 2003; 302: 459-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). An important contradiction to be clarified in host-pathogen interactions is the fact that Rho proteins are activated both by bacterial virulence factors and by host cell receptors engaged in pathogen recognition. In this respect, CNF1 toxin is a particularly suitable model. This bacterial toxin specifically deamidates glutamine 63 of RhoA (and its equivalent in Rac and Cdc42) into a glutamic acid (12Flatau G. Lemichez E. Gauthier M. Chardin P. Paris S. Fiorentini C. Boquet P. Nature. 1997; 387: 729-733Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar, 13Schmidt G. Sehr P. Wilm M. Selzer J. Mann M. Aktories K.

Chem. 1999; 274: 28999-29004Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). This point mutation, catalyzed by CNF1, abrogates the GTPase activity of Rho proteins and produces their permanent activation. Once they are constitutively activated, Rho proteins are rapidly conveyed to the ubiquitin-mediated proteasomal degradation pathway (15Doye A. Mettouchi A. Bossis G. Clement R. Buisson-Touati C.

Infect. Immun. 2002; 70: 4053-4058Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Thus CNF1 uses a seemingly counterintuitive mechanism, first constitutively activating Rho proteins (deamidation), so they are prone to inactivation (degradation). This mechanism results in a moderate activation of Rho proteins and confers highly invasive properties to CNF1-producing uropathogenic E. coli and meningitis K1 E. coli (15Doye A. Mettouchi A.

These have been characterized in Salmonella, which co-inject SopE for Rac and Cdc42 activation and SptP for Rac and Cdc42 inactivation (18Kubori T. Galan J.E. Cell. 2003; 115: 333-342Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). As compared with invasive factors injected upon bacterial contact with host cell target, CNF1 shares with the A-B toxins the ability to enter host cells independently of other bacterial factors (1Boquet P. Lemichez E. Trends Cell Biol. 2003; 13: 238-246Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). In the present study we took advantage of the toxic properties of CNF1 to investigate the cellular responses it elicits, independently of the productive bacteria. Cells and Reagents—Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) were obtained from PromoCell (Heidelberg, Germany). Cells were grown in human endothelial SFM medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with defined growth factors (d-SFM): 10 ng/ml epidermal growth factor and 20 ng/ml basic fibroblast growth factor (Invitrogen), 1 μg/ml heparin (Sigma-Aldrich), and either 20% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen) or 1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin (ELISA grade, Sigma-Aldrich) together with penicillin and streptomycin (Invitrogen). Cells were grown on 0.2% gelatin-coated dishes (Sigma-Aldrich). Transfections of HUVECs were carried out as previously described (19Mettouchi A. Klein S. Guo W. Lopez-Lago M. Lemichez E. Westwick J.K. Giancotti F.G. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 115-127Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). Antibodies used were monoclonal anti-β-actin antibody (clone AC-74, Sigma-Aldrich); anti-RhoA, anti-Cdc42, anti-Rac1, and anti-Ras antibodies (BD Transduction Laboratories); anti-HA (clone 11, BabCO); anti-E-selectin (clone CTB202, Santa Cruz Biotechnology); rabbit polyclonal anti-phospho-p44/42 MAP kinase (Thr202/Tyr204), anti-phospsho-p38 MAP kinase (Thr180/Tyr182), and anti-phospho-c-Jun (Ser73, Cell Signaling Technology); anti-human IκBα (Upstate Biotechnology); and anti-TRAF1 (H-186, Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Primary antibodies were visualized using goat anti-mouse or anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (DAKO, Glostrup, Denmark). TRAF1 rabbit antibodies were visualized using biotin-XX goat anti-rabbit IgG followed by streptavidin horseradish peroxidase conjugate (Molecular Probes). DNA vectors corresponding to pcDNA3RhoQ63L, RacQ61L, and Cdc42Q61L were provided by Manor, D (20Lin R. Cerione R.A. Manor D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 23633-23641Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). DNA Array Analysis—CNF1-regulated genes were analyzed by Aros Applied Biotechnology ApS (www.arosab.com), using the Affymetrix technology (21Lipshutz R.J. Fodor S.P. Gingeras T.R. Lockhart D.J. Nat. Genet. 1999; 21: 20-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (1865) Google Scholar) and Affymetrix® Human GeneChip U133A and U133B, as recommended by the manufacturer (www.Affymetrix.com). HUVECs were seeded at 8 × 106 cells/150-mm gelatin-coated dish in d-SFM containing BSA. HUVECs were intoxicated in parallel for 3 and 24 h in d-SFM/BSA supplemented with 10-9m CNF1. HUVECs were lysed in RTL buffer for RNA extraction by RNeasy MiniKit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). Both integrity and purity of RNA were checked using the Bioanalyzer 2100 and RNA 6000 LabChip kit from Agilent Technologies (Palo Alto, CA). Total RNA (5 μg) was used as starting material for the cDNA preparation. The first and second strand cDNA synthesis was performed using the SuperScript II System (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions except using an oligo(dT) primer containing a T7 RNA polymerase promoter site. Labeled cRNA was prepared using the Bio-Array High Yield RNA Transcript Labeling Kit (Enzo Biochem, New York, NY). Biotin-labeled CTP and UTP (Enzo) were used in the reaction together with unlabeled NTPs. Following the in vitro transcription reaction, the unincorporated nucleotides were removed using RNeasy columns (Qiagen). cRNA (15 μg) was fragmented at 94 °C for 35 min in a fragmentation buffer containing 40 mm Tris acetate, pH 8.1, 100 mm KOAc, 30 mm MgOAc. Prior to hybridization, the fragmented cRNA in a 6× SSPE-T hybridization buffer (1 m NaCl, 10 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 0.005% Triton) was heated to 95 °C for 5 min and subsequently to 45 °C for 5 min before loading onto the Affymetrix HG_U133A and U133B probe array cartridges. The probe array was then incubated for 16 h at 45 °C at constant rotation (60 rpm). The washing and staining procedure was performed in the Affymetrix Fluidics Station 400. The probe array was exposed to 10 washes in 6× SSPE-T at 25 °C followed by four washes in 0.5× SSPE-T at 50 °C. The biotinylated cRNA was stained with a streptavidin-phycoerythrin conjugate, at a final concentration a 2 mg/ml (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) in 6× SSPE-T for 30 min at 25 °C followed by 10 washes in 6× SSPE-T at 25 °C. An antibody amplification step followed using normal goat IgG as blocking reagent, at a final concentration of 0.1 mg/ml (Sigma), and biotinylated anti-streptavidin antibody (goat), at a final concentration of 3 mg/ml (Vector Laboratories). This was followed by a staining step with a streptavidin-phycoerythrin conjugate, at a final concentration of 2 mg/ml (Molecular Probes) in 6× SSPE-T for 30 min at 25 °C, and 10 washes in 6× SSPE-T at 25 °C. The probe arrays were scanned at 560 nm using a confocal laser scanning microscope (Hewlett Packard GeneArray Scanner G2500A). The readings from the quantitative scanning were analyzed by the Affymetrix Gene Expression Analysis Software 5.0 (MAS 5.0) (22Hubbell E. Liu W.-M. Mei R. Bioinformatics. 2002; 18: 1585-1592Crossref PubMed Scopus (495) Google Scholar). Data from the individual samples were subjected to pairwise comparison analyses in the Software MAS 5.0, based on empirical algorithms as described by the manufacturer on their web site (www.affymetrix.com/support/technical/technotes/statistical_reference_guide.pdf). Briefly, the Change Algorithm indicated a change in transcript level between a baseline and an experiment array, further indicating an increase, marginal increase, decrease, marginal decrease, or no change in gene expression. On the other hand, the Signal Log Ratio Algorithm estimated the magnitude and direction of change of a transcript when two arrays were compared (experiment versus baseline), expressed as the log2 ratio. In our analysis, these algorithms allowed the comparison between two samples, the one used as baseline being the non-intoxicated cells, and the experiment being the cells intoxicated by CNF1 for 3 or 24 h. This analysis of gene expression reported by the Affymetrix software in paired experiments indicated whether a statistically significant change in expression had occurred. We considered that a gene was significantly induced or repressed when the Signal Log Ratio was ≥2 or ≤-2, respectively. Toxins—For recombinant CNF1 and CNF1-C866S toxin purification, E. coli OneShot bacteria, carrying pCR2cnf1 or pCR2cnf1C866S, were grown overnight at 37 °C in LB medium. Bacteria were harvested by centrifugation, suspended in 30 ml of phosphate-buffered saline, and lysed using a French press. The lysate was centrifuged (30,000 × g for 30 min, at 4 °C), and the supernatant was precipitated with the same volume of saturated ammonium sulfate for 5–8 h. The precipitate was then dialyzed against TN buffer (25 mm Tris (pH 7.4), 50 mm NaCl) and applied on a DEAE fast flow column (11 × 1.5 cm, Amersham Biosciences). The column was washed for 200 min with the same buffer (1 ml/min). CNF1 was eluted with a 50 to 300 mm NaCl gradient during 100 min (elution around 200 mm NaCl). The fractions containing CNF1 were pooled, dialyzed against TN buffer, and applied on a Superdex 75 column (0.3 ml/min, Amersham Biosciences). The fractions containing CNF1 were pooled, concentrated, and applied on a Mono Q column (Amersham Biosciences). After a 20-min wash (1 ml/min) of the column with TN buffer, CNF1 was eluted using a 50 to 400 mm NaCl gradient (elution around 350 mm NaCl). CNF1 purification process was checked by SDS-PAGE. The activity of the different batches of CNF1 toxin was estimated by using an HEp-2 cell multinucleation assay previously described (23Lemichez E. Flatau G. Bruzzone M. Boquet P. Gauthier M. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 24: 1061-1070Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). The purified CNF1 toxin used in this study produced at 10-12m 50% of multinucleation of HEp-2 cells after 48 h of intoxication (Supplemental Fig. 2). After purification, the cell binding activity of the catalytic inactive toxin CNF1-C866S was estimated by measuring its competing effects on the CNF1-induced multinucleation of HEp-2 cells (Supplemental Fig. 2). ELISA—HUVECs were seeded 24 h before toxin addition at 2 × 105 cells/22.5 mm or 5 × 105 cells/35 mm well in d-SFM-containing serum. Intoxication of cells was performed by addition of fresh medium containing CNF1, for different periods of time. The medium was replaced, 1 h before intoxication ended, by d-SFM-containing BSA, for ELISA. Production of IL-8, monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1), IL-6, monocyte inflammatory protein-3α (MIP-3α), TNF-α, and RANTES (regulated on activation normal T cell expressed and secreted) was assessed using human Quantikine® immunoassays, as recommended by the manufacturer (R & D Systems, Abingdon, UK). Pull-down and Immunoblotting—Activated Rho, Rac, and Cdc42 GST-protein pull-down experiments were performed as described in Ref. 15Doye A. Mettouchi A. Bossis G. Clement R. Buisson-Touati C. Flatau G. Gagnoux L. Piechaczyk M. Boquet P. Lemichez E. Cell. 2002; 111: 553-564Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar. For activated Ras measurements we made use of GST-RBD1–149 of Raf1 as described by the authors (24de Rooij J. Bos J.L. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 623-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar). Proteins were resolved on 12% SDS-PAGE, transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes, and immunoblotted, and then chemiluminescence detection was carried out (Amersham Biosciences). Activation of Rho GTPases by CNF1 Interferes with Host Cell Signaling Pathways—The molecular mechanism of action of CNF1 is dual. It consists of a permanent activation of Rho proteins, which results in their sensitization to ubiquitin-mediated proteasomal degradation (12Flatau G. Lemichez E. Gauthier M. Chardin P. Paris S. Fiorentini C. Boquet P. Nature. 1997; 387: 729-733Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar, 13Schmidt G. Sehr P. Wilm M. Selzer J. Mann M. Aktories K.

Immun. 2002; 70: 4053-4058Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). We have previously established that this dual mechanism of action confers higher invasive properties to pathogenic bacteria (15Doye A. Mettouchi A. Bossis G. Clement R. Buisson-Touati C. Flatau G. Gagnoux L. Piechaczyk M. Boquet P. Lemichez E. Cell. 2002; 111: 553-564Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). Considering that activated Rho proteins might interfere with cellular programs of transcription, we further investigated the relationship between the host response and the CNF1-induced Rho protein activation (deamidation) and deactivation (proteasomal degradation). We thus first screened the host cell genetic program elicited by CNF1 in primary human endothelial cells (HUVECs) using conditions of maximal activation of Rho proteins. We assumed that, in addition, this approach should inform us of the type of cellular response engaged by Rho protein activation. HUVECs represent a relevant cellular system for meningitis-causing E. coli K1, producing CNF1 (17Khan N.A. Wang Y. Kim K.J. Chung J.W. Wass C.A. Kim K.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 15607-15612Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). In addition, HUVECs have the advantage of being primary cells, an important aspect in conducting signal transduction studies. Kinetics of CNF1-induced Rac1, Cdc42, and RhoA activation were first established (Fig. 1A). Activation of the Rho protein family appeared specific, as compared with the Ras GTPase. These measurements do not represent an exhaustive list of the Rho proteins activated by CNF1, because other Rho members are known to bear the canonical sequence for CNF1 recognition/modification (14Lerm M. Schmidt G. Goehring U.M. Schirmer J. Aktories K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28999-29004Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, these measurements indicate that all the three Rho proteins exhibit a maximal activation about 2 h after exposure to CNF1 (Fig. 1B). The interference of CNF1 with classic signaling pathways leading to gene regulation was next investigated. Consistent with the absence of Ras activation, CNF1 did not produce ERK1/2 phosphorylation (Fig. 1, A and C). Rather, CNF1 appeared to interfere with the stress-activated protein kinase signaling pathways, unraveled by p38 MAPK and c-Jun phosphorylation (Fig. 1C). CNF1 also interfered with the NFκB pathway, as indicated by IκB-α depletion (Fig. 1C). Having established that CNF1 modulates gene-signaling pathways prompted us to determine the type of endothelial cell response elicited by CNF1 intoxication. Transcriptome of Primary Endothelial Cells Intoxicated by CNF1—The effect of CNF1 on gene regulation was screened both at 3- and 24-h intervals after the addition of the toxin, using U133A and U133B Affymetrix® microarrays. These arrays resulted in a large screen of the activity of about 33,000 human genes. CNF1 triggers a gene response consisting of a selective activation of only 0.19% and 0.08% of the genes probed at 3 and 24 h, respectively (Fig. 2A and Table I). Only 0.04% and 0.03% of the genes probed were found to be inhibited at 3 and 24 h of CNF1 exposure, respectively, although at low levels (Fig. 2A and Table II). A majority of genes was found induced at a higher level after 3 h (as compared with 24 h) of CNF1 exposure, thereby following the kinetics of Rho protein activation by the toxin (Figs. 1B and 2A). No clear functions could be assigned to genetic programs either engaged specifically at 24 h or corresponding to down-regulated genes. In contrast, we observed that the 10 most activated genes formed a coherent family of inflammatory mediators, aimed at leukocyte recruitment and activation (Fig. 2B and Table I) (25Baggiolini M. Loetscher P. Immunol. Today. 2000; 21: 418-420Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Induction of inflammatory chemokine-encoding genes could be correlated to the induction of the leukocyte cell-binding receptors E-selectin and ICAM-1. Cell response to CNF1 also includes MIP-3α/CCL20, a chemokine of dendritic cells (Fig. 2B) (26Dieu M.C. Vanbervliet B. Vicari A. Bridon J.M. Oldham E. Ait-Yahia S. Briere F. Zlotnik A. Lebecque S. Caux C. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 188: 373-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (1209) Google Scholar). Finally, TRAF1 (TNF-receptor associated protein-1) and cIAP2 (mammalian inhibitor of apoptosis protein-1 homologue C) were assigned in impairing TNF-α receptor cell death signaling (Fig. 2B and Table I) (27Barnhart B.C. Peter M.E. Cell. 2003; 114: 148-150Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). This screen orientated us in studying the specificity of the production of a representative set of inflammatory mediators toward the CNF1 activity and Rho protein activation. We reasoned that, in addition to shedding light on the CNF1 mechanism of action, this should establish whether this list might represent putative Rho-regulated genes in endothelial cells.Table ICNF1-induced genes Level of gene activation expressed as the ratio of the gene signal from CNF1-treated (at 3 and 24 h) cells to the gene signal from untreated control cells (SLR signal log ratio).ProteinsGenBank™FunctionSLR3 h24 hInflammatory cell mediatorsMIP-3α (CCL20)NM_004591.1Immature dendritic cell chemokine9.76.9CSF-2 (GM-SCF2)M11734.1Granulocyte/macrophage colony-stimulating factor6.2ncanc, transcripts that were either absent or presented no significant changesGROγ (CXCL3)NM_002090.1T lymphocytes CXCL chemokine5.7ncMCP-1 (CCL2)S69738.1Monocyte chemotactic and activating factor5.63.7IL-8 (CXCL8)AF043337.1Neutrophil/granulocyte CXCL chemotactic factor5.2bGenes that have been found several times under different GenBank™ accession numbers1.1GROβ (CXCL2)M57731.1T lymphocytes CXCL chemokine4.72.3GROα (CXCL1)NM_001511.1T lymphocytes CXCL chemokine4.32.7TNFC (LTβ)NM_002341.1TNF-soluble factor 33.11.3SCFAF119835.1Mast cells induction2.91.8COX2NM_000963.1Prostaglandin G/H synthase2.61.5Fractalkine (CX3CL1)U84487T cell and monocyte chemokine2.4ncCSF-1M37435.1Macrophage colony-stimulating Factor-12.21.1β-A inhibinM13436.1TGF-β family member2.10.3BMP5NM_021073.1Transforming growth factor1.82.1IL-6NM_000600.1Regulatory T cells CXCL cytokine1.40.6Other innate immunity effectorsC3NM_001993.2Complement factor III3.6ncSerpinB2NM_002575.1Plasminogen activator inhibitor3.11.3NPTX1NM_002522.1C-reactive protein (Pentraxin-1)2.7ncC9NM_000133.2Complement factor IX2.3ncGliPRNM_006851.1Homologous to plant PR-1 innate immunity component2.7bGenes that have been found several times under different GenBank™ accession numbers0.8Adhesion and cytoskeleton regulatorsE-selectin (SELE)NM_000450.1Endothelial leukocyte adhesion11.14.8ICAM-1NM_000201.1Ligand for lymphocyte-function associated antigens6.2bGenes that have been found several times under different GenBank™ accession numbers2.9Cyritestin-1 (CYRN1)X89655.1Metalloprotease-disintegrin ADAM family3.4ncRho6 (Rnd1)U69563GTP-binding protein3.41.1Laminin γ2 (LAMC2)NM_018891.1Extracellular matrix adhesion3.2bGenes that have been found several times under different GenBank™ accession numbers2.7VCAM-1NM_001078.1Monocytes and lymphocytes adhesion3.1ncMyosin regulatory light chain (MYRL2)NM_006097.1Cell contractile activity2.91.9Transgelin (SM22)NM_003186.2Actin binding2.31.5NAG22 (CALD1)NM_018495.3Calmodulin- and actin-binding protein 12.1ncADAMTS1AK023795.1Disintegrin-like metalloprotease0.42.0Semaphorin 6AW92748ENA/VASP regulatory proteinnc3.2Plectin 1AU155361Intermediate filament-binding proteinnc3.0METH1AF060152.1Disintegrin-like metalloproteasenc2.9Other signaling moleculesTRAF1NM_005658.1TNF receptor-associated factor 15.23.2CIAP2U37546.1TRAF1/2-binding protein4.72.2TNFAIP3 (A20)NM_006290.1Inhibition of TNF receptor-induced apoptosis4.71.9Parkin co-regulated geneBF224076Putative ubiquitin/proteasome system3.9ncInterleukin 7 receptor (IL7R)NM_002185.1Apoptosis inhibition3.71.9BCL2-related protein A1 (BCL-2A1)NM_004049.1Cell survival promoter3.61.3NFκBIαAI078167NF-κB inhibitor3.21.5CRE-BPaNM_004904.1c-AMP response element-binding protein2.1ncCD69 early activation antigenL07555.1Transmembrane receptor3.2ncSyndecan-4 (SDC4)NM_002999.1Transmembrane intracellular communication2.80.6B-cell CLL/lymphoma 3 (BCL-3)NM_005178.1NF-κB regulation2.70.9TMPRSS3NM_024022.1Transmembrane serine protease2.6ncPlasminogen activator urokinaseK03226.1Arteries lumen restriction2.6bGenes that have been found several times under different GenBank™ accession numbers0.9PDGF-αNM_002607.1Platelet-derived growth factor-α2.51.7DUSP8NM_004420.1Tyr, Ser, and Thr protein phosphatase2.30.7HERC3NM_014606.1GEF and E3 ubiquitin ligase2.2ncGADD45βAF087853.1Regulator of p38/JNK pathways2.1ncProlactin receptor isoform delta S1 precursorAF349939.1Jak signalingnc3.6Transcription factors and modulatorsInterferon regulatory factor 1 (IRF1)NM_002198.1Transcription activator3.30.8Kruppel-like factor 4 (KLF4)BF514079Associated with G1/S growth arrest3.0bGenes that have been found several times under different GenBank™ accession numbers2.1Nuclear receptor (NR4A3)NM_006981.1Orphan nuclear receptor NOR-1 modulator2.8ncKruppel-like factor 2 (KLF2)NM_016270.1Negative regulator of adipogenesis2.72.3Elongation Factor-2 (ELL2)NM_012081.1RNA polymerase II elongation factor2.40.7NFκB2BC002844.1Transcription factor2.31.5JUNBNM_002229.1Transcription factor2.30.7RelBNM_006509.1NF-κB transcription factor family2.31.4CARPNM_014391.1Negative regulator of cardiac gene expression2.1ncATF3NM_001674.1Activating transcription factor 32.0ncAML1bD43968.1Runt-related transc"
https://openalex.org/W1974213594,"Actin-interacting protein 1 (AIP1) is a WD40 repeat protein that enhances actin filament disassembly in the presence of actin-depolymerizing factor (ADF)/cofilin. AIP1 also caps the barbed end of ADF/cofilin-bound actin filament. However, the mechanism by which AIP1 interacts with ADF/cofilin and actin is not clearly understood. We determined the crystal structure of Caenorhabditis elegans AIP1 (UNC-78), which revealed 14 WD40 modules arranged in two seven-bladed β-propeller domains. The structure allowed for the mapping of conserved surface residues, and mutagenesis studies identified five residues that affected the ADF/cofilin-dependent actin filament disassembly activity. Mutations of these residues, which reside in blades 3 and 4 in the N-terminal propeller domain, had significant effects on the disassembly activity but did not alter the barbed end capping activity. These data support a model in which this conserved surface of AIP1 plays a direct role in enhancing fragmentation/depolymerization of ADF/cofilin-bound actin filaments but not in barbed end capping.

These data support a model in which this conserved surface of AIP1 plays a direct role in enhancing fragmentation/depolymerization of ADF/cofilin-bound actin filaments but not in barbed end capping. Actin filaments are the core components of the highly dynamic actin cytoskeleton, which plays an essential role in a wide range of biological processes. Regulated fragmentation and depolymerization of actin filaments are important for disassembling specific cytoskeletal structures and maintaining high concentrations of monomeric actin, thereby enhancing actin filament turnover. Actin-depolymerizing factor (ADF) 1The abbreviations used are: ADF, actin-depolymerizing factor; AIP1, actin-interacting protein 1; GST, glutathione S-transferase; MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid; r.m.s., root mean square. 1The abbreviations used are: ADF, actin-depolymerizing factor; AIP1, actin-interacting protein 1; GST, glutathione S-transferase; MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid; r.m.s., root mean square./cofilin plays a central role in the disassembly process by accelerating monomer dissociation from the pointed ends and severing filaments (reviewed in Refs. 1Bamburg J.R. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; 15: 185-230Google Scholar, 2Bamburg J.R. McGough A. Ono S. Trends Cell Biol. 1999; 9: 364-370Google Scholar, 3Carlier M.F. Ressad F. Pantaloni D. J. Biol.

Actin-interacting protein 1 (AIP1) is a unique regulator of ADF/cofilin-mediated actin dynamics (reviewed in Ref. 5Ono S. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 13363-13370Google Scholar). The interaction between AIP1 and actin was originally detected by a yeast two-hybrid system (6Amberg D.C. Basart E. Botstein D. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 28-35Google Scholar). In vitro, AIP1 alone has negligible or very weak effects on actin dynamics, whereas, in the presence of ADF/cofilin, AIP1 enhances filament fragmentation (7Aizawa H. Katadae M. Maruya M. Sameshima M. Murakami-Murofushi K. Yahara I. Genes Cells. 1999; 4: 311-324Google Scholar, 8Okada K. Obinata T. Abe H. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 1553-1565Google Scholar, 9Rodal A.A. Tetreault J.W. Lappalainen P. Drubin D.G. Amberg D.C. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 1251-1264Google Scholar). In addition, AIP1 has the ability to cap barbed ends and bind to the side of ADF/cofilin-bound filaments (10Okada K. Blanchoin L. Abe H. Chen H. Pollard T.D. Bamburg J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 43011-43016Google Scholar). Although the capping activity has been suggested to enhance filament fragmentation by preventing reannealing of the severed filaments (10Okada K. Blanchoin L. Abe H. Chen H. Pollard T.D. Bamburg J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 43011-43016Google Scholar, 11Balcer H.I. Goodman A.L. Rodal A.A. Smith E. Kugler J. Heuser J.E. Goode B.L. Curr. Biol. 2003; 13: 2159-2169Google Scholar), direct microscopic observation of the effects of AIP1 on ADF/cofilin-bound filaments indicates that AIP1 actively disassembles ADF/cofilin-bound filaments, and simple barbed end capping by other capping agents does not enhance disassembly by ADF/cofilin (12Ono S. Mohri K. Ono K. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 14207-14212Google Scholar). At present, the biological significance of the capping activity of AIP1 is not well understood. The mechanism by which AIP1 selectively interacts with ADF/cofilin-bound actin filaments is unknown. Actin residues in subdomains 3 and 4 participate in the two-hybrid interaction with yeast AIP1 (6Amberg D.C. Basart E. Botstein D. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 28-35Google Scholar). The AIP1-interacting residues in subdomain 3 are also required for interaction with cofilin (9Rodal A.A. Tetreault J.W. Lappalainen P. Drubin D.G. Amberg D.C. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 1251-1264Google Scholar), suggesting that AIP1 directly interacts with subdomain 4 of actin and indirectly with subdomain 3, which might be mediated by endogenously expressed yeast cofilin. The C terminus of ADF/cofilin is required for binding to F-actin, but not to G-actin (13Lappalainen P. Fedorov E.V. Fedorov A.A. Almo S.C. Drubin D.G. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5520-5530Google Scholar, 14Ono S. McGough A. Pope B.J. Tolbert V.T. Bui A. Pohl J. Benian G.M. Gernert K.M. Weeds A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 5952-5958Google Scholar), and also for the two-hybrid interaction with AIP1 (9Rodal A.A. Tetreault J.W. Lappalainen P. Drubin D.G. Amberg D.C. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 1251-1264Google Scholar) and activation of filament disassembly by AIP1 (15Mohri K. Ono S. J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 4107-4118Google Scholar). ADF/cofilin interacts with two actin subunits in the filament (16McGough A. Pope B. Chiu W. Weeds A. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 771-781Google Scholar), and the C terminus of ADF/cofilin is predicted to be close to subdomains 2 and 1 of the lower actin subunit in the filament (14Ono S. McGough A. Pope B.J. Tolbert V.T. Bui A. Pohl J. Benian G.M. Gernert K.M. Weeds A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 5952-5958Google Scholar). Therefore, this region of ADF/cofilin is not likely to be a binding site for AIP1. Rather, the C terminus of ADF/cofilin might participate in modulating the twist of the filament (16McGough A. Pope B. Chiu W. Weeds A. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 771-781Google Scholar, 17McGough A. Chiu W. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 291: 513-519Google Scholar) or stabilizing a particular conformation of the filament (18Galkin V.E. Orlova A. Lukoyanova N. Wriggers W. Egelman E.H. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 75-86Google Scholar, 19Galkin V.E. Orlova A. VanLoock M.S. Shvetsov A. Reisler E. Egelman E.H. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 163: 1057-1066Google Scholar), which might support binding of AIP1. AIP1 is conserved among eukaryotes and is involved in the cytoskeletal regulation in vivo. In budding yeast, an AIP1-null mutant is viable but synthetic lethal in combination with cofilin alleles (9Rodal A.A. Tetreault J.W. Lappalainen P. Drubin D.G. Amberg D.C. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 1251-1264Google Scholar, 20Iida K. Yahara I. Genes Cells. 1999; 4: 21-32Google Scholar). Yeast AIP1 co-localizes with cofilin to the cortical actin patches, and an AIP1 null mutation results in mislocalization of cofilin to cable-like structures (9Rodal A.A. Tetreault J.W. Lappalainen P. Drubin D.G. Amberg D.C. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 1251-1264Google Scholar, 20Iida K. Yahara I. Genes Cells. 1999; 4: 21-32Google Scholar). In Caenorhabditis elegans, mutations of the unc-78 gene, which encodes AIP1, cause disorganization of actin filaments in the body wall muscle (21Ono S. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 1313-1319Google Scholar), and unc-78 shows genetic interactions with the unc-60B ADF/cofilin gene that is required for proper organization of muscle actin filaments (22Ono S. Baillie D.L. Benian G.M. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 491-502Google Scholar). UNC-78/AIP1 strongly disassembles UNC-60B-bound actin filaments but shows very weak effects on actin filaments in the presence of the ubiquitously expressed UNC-60A (15Mohri K. Ono S. J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 4107-4118Google Scholar, 23Ono S. Benian G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3778-3783Google Scholar, 24Ono K. Parast M. Alberico C. Benian G.M. Ono S. J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 2073-2085Google Scholar). In Dictyostelium discoideum, an AIP1-null mutation partially impairs several actin-dependent cellular processes, including cytokinesis and cell motility (25Gerisch G. Faix J. Kohler J. Müller-Taubenberger A. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 2004; 57: 18-25Google Scholar, 26Konzok A. Weber I. Simmeth E. Hacker U. Maniak M. Müller-Taubenberger A. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 453-464Google Scholar). In Arabidopsis, AIP1 co-localizes with ADF (27Allwood E.G. Anthony R.G. Smertenko A.P. Reichelt S. Drobak B.K. Doonan J.H. Weeds A.G. Hussey P.J. Plant Cell. 2002; 14: 2915-2927Google Scholar) and plays essential roles in actin organization and plant development (28Ketelaar T. Allwood E.G. Anthony R. Voigt B. Menzel D. Hussey P.J. Curr. Biol. 2004; 14: 145-149Google Scholar). In cultured Drosophila cells, cofilin (Twinstar) and AIP1 are required for lamella formation (29Rogers S.L. Wiedemann U. Stuurman N. Vale R.D. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 162: 1079-1088Google Scholar). Co-localization of AIP1 with ADF/cofilin is also reported in other organisms (reviewed in Ref. 5Ono S. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 13363-13370Google Scholar), suggesting that they are evolutionarily conserved co-regulators for actin cytoskeleton. We determined the crystal structure of C. elegans UNC-78/AIP1 at 1.9-Å resolution, which allowed for the identification of highly conserved surface residues. Mutagenesis studies targeted 20 of these residues and identified five residues that alter the activity of UNC-78/AIP1. Importantly, these mutations uncouple filament disassembly activity from capping activity. Our results also highlight the location of a functionally relevant surface of UNC-78/AIP1 and suggest distinct roles for filament binding and disassembly. Proteins—Rabbit skeletal muscle actin was purified as described (30Pardee J.D. Spudich J.A. Methods Enzymol. 1982; 85: 164-181Google Scholar). Bacterially expressed recombinant UNC-60B was purified as described previously (23Ono S. Benian G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3778-3783Google Scholar). Bacterially expressed recombinant UNC-78 with no tag was purified as described previously (15Mohri K. Ono S. J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 4107-4118Google Scholar). Recombinant glutathione S-transferase (GST) was expressed from pGEX-2T (Amersham Biosciences) in Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) and purified with glutathione-Uniflow (BD Biosciences Clontech) following the manufacturer's instruction. Crystallization and Data Collection—Recombinant untagged UNC-78 protein was dialyzed against 20 mm Tris-HCl, 50 mm KCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, pH 7.5, and concentrated to 3.5–7.0 mg/ml for crystallization. Initial crystallization conditions were determined by hanging drop vapor diffusion using equal volumes of the protein (3–4 mg/ml) and a precipitant suspended above 1 ml of the precipitant. Clusters of plates grew from 0.1 m MES, 20% polyethylene glycol 8000, 10 mm MnCl2, 3% glycerol, pH 6.0. After careful dissection, a small fragment was transferred to mother liquor supplemented with 20% glycerol as a cryoprotectant and flash-cooled to 100 K prior to data collection. Diffraction was consistent with the monoclinic space group P21, (unit cell dimensions: a = 40.66, b = 90.82, c = 76.98 Å; β = 94.06°), and native data were collected to 2.0 Å using a MARCCD and radiation of λ = 0.98 Å at National Synchrotron Light Source beamline X9A. All attempts to obtain heavy atom derivatives for these crystals were unsuccessful, as were efforts to produce selenomethionyl-derivatized protein. The addition of 2.44 mm n-octanoylsucrose resulted in the growth of small single crystals, which were used for microseeding. Single crystals grew to a size of 0.3 × 0.4 × 0.25 mm3 after 2 weeks at 18 °C. Diffraction from these crystals extended to 1.6-Å resolution and was consistent with the monoclinic space group P21 (unit cell dimensions: a = 64.84, b = 65.17, c = 69.24 Å; β = 98.28°). Data from native and derivative crystals were collected at National Synchrotron Light Source beamline X9B using an ADSC Quantum 4 CCD detector at a temperature of 100 K, processed with the HKL 2000 package, and scaled and merged with SCALEPACK (31Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Google Scholar) (see Table I for a summary of data collection). Native data were collected to 1.70-Å resolution, using 0.98-Å wavelength radiation. A high quality derivative was prepared by soaking crystals in mother liquor containing 2 mm sodium salt of ethylmercurithiosalicylic acid for 5 h prior to freezing. Single anomalous dispersion data were collected to 1.6 Å using a wavelength of 1.00756 Å.Table ISummary of diffraction dataData reductionNativeNativeEMTSPDB entry1PEV1NR0Space groupP21P21P21Unit cella = 40.66, b = 90.817, c = 76.983 Åa = 64.845, b = 65.174, c = 69.24 Åa = 65.02, b = 64.972, c = 69.347 Åα = β = 90°, γ = 94.06°α = β = 90°, γ = 98.276°α = β = 90°, γ = 98.285°Resolution of data (Å)21.7 to 2.023.6 to 1.7023 to 1.60Completeness of data set (%)97.098.695.9Average I/σ of data set16.119.218.9Completeness of outermost shell (%)87.897.784.1Average I/σ of outermost shell3.45.04.1Rsym(I)aRsym(I) = ΣhΣiIi - IΣhΣiI, where I is the mean intensity of the I observations of reflection h (%)5.84.54.2PhasingPhasing power at 2.5 ÅbPhasing power = r.m.s.

Sheldrick G.M. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1999; 9: 643-648Google Scholar). The resulting map was of excellent quality and allowed for automated model building with ARP/wARP (33Perrakis A. Morris R. Lamzin V.S. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 458-463Google Scholar), which fit 574 of 611 residues, with an Rcryst and Rfree of 32.4 and 35.8%, respectively. The model of the mercury-derivatized UNC-78 was completed with alternating rounds of refinement with CNS (34Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Google Scholar) and manual rebuilding with O (35Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Google Scholar), which resulted in Rcryst and Rfree of 28.0 and 30.2%, respectively. AMORE (36Navaza J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2001; 57: 1367-1372Google Scholar) was used to orient the structure of the mercury derivative in the native unit cell. The native structure was refined with maximum likelihood simulated annealing, as implemented in CNS. Solvent molecules were built into 3.5 σ peaks in difference Fourier syntheses, and a Mn2+ ion was subsequently assigned on the basis of observed electron density, coordination number, geometry, and refined temperature factors. The final model (1NR0) consists of 4581 protein atoms, a single Mn2+, and 716 water molecules with converged Rcryst and Rfree of 19.9 and 23.0%, respectively, using all data between 23.6 and 1.7 Å (Table I and Fig. 1E). The structure of the first crystal form was solved by molecular replacement with CNS, using 1NR0 structure as the search model. The final model (1PEV) consisted of 4600 protein atoms and 330 water molecules with converged Rcryst and Rfree of 19.7 and 23.4%, respectively, using all data between 21.7- and 2.0-Å resolution. No Mn2+ was detected in the structure (Table I). Expression and Purification of Recombinant GST-UNC-78 Protein— The full-length UNC-78 cDNA was digested with BamHI and HindIII from the pET-UNC-78 vector (15Mohri K. Ono S. J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 4107-4118Google Scholar) and cloned into pGEX-2T (Amersham Biosciences) between BamHI and SmaI sites (pGEX-UNC-78). The E. coli strain BL21 (DE3) was transformed with pGEX-UNC-78 and cultured in M9ZB medium containing 50 μg/ml ampicillin at 37 °C until A600 reached 0.6 cm-1. Then the culture was cooled to room temperature, and protein expression was induced by adding 0.1 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside for 3 h at room temperature. The cells were harvested by centrifugation at 5000 × g for 10 min and disrupted by a French pressure cell at 5000–8000 pounds/in2 in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.2 mm dithiothreitol and 1 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride. The homogenates were centrifuged at 20,000 × g, and the supernatants were applied to a glutathione-Uniflow column (BD Biosciences Clontech). Bound proteins were eluted with 10 mm glutathione, 20 mm Tris-HCl, 0.2 mm dithiothreitol, pH 8.0. Fractions containing pure GST-UNC-78 were dialyzed against 0.1 m KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 50% glycerol, 20 mm Hepes-NaOH, pH 7.5, overnight at 4 °C and stored at -20 °C. The concentration of GST-UNC-78 was determined using a calculated extinction coefficient (37Gill S.C. von Hippel P.H. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 182: 319-326Google Scholar) of 126,680 m-1 cm-1 at 280 nm. Mutagenesis—Mutagenesis was performed with a QuikChange™ mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) using pGEX-UNC-78 as a template. Mutagenesis primers (Table II) were synthesized and purified with high performance liquid chromatography by Qiagen-Operon. The entire UNC-78 coding region was sequenced to confirm the presence of introduced mutations and the absence of PCR-induced errors. Mutant GST-UNC-78 proteins were expressed and purified by the same method as wild type GST-UNC-78. The calculated extinction coefficient for the Y73A mutant is 125,400 m-1 cm-1 at 280 nm. The calculated extinction coefficients for the other mutants are the same value as wild type.Table IIMutagenesis primersPrimeraPrimers are designated by the mutations followed by S (sense) or AS (antisense)SequenceY73A-SCCCAAGTGGTTATGCTTGTGCTTCTGGY73A-ASCCAGAAGCACAAGCATAACCACTTGGGK96A-SCACCCACATTCTGGCAACTACTATTCCK96A-ASGGAATAGTAGTTGCCAGAATGTGGGTGE114A-SCGTGGGATAGCGCAAGTAAGAGAATTGE114A-ASCAATTCTCTTACTTGCGCTATCCCACGE123A-SGCCGTTGGAGCAGGCAGAGAACGTTTCE123A-ASGAAACGTTCTCTGCCTGCTCCAACGGCR125A-SGTTGGAGAAGGCGCAGAACGTTTCGR125A-ASCGAAACGTTCTGCGCCTTCTCCAACE126A-SGGAGAAGGCAGAGCACGTTTCGGTCE126A-ASGACCGAAACGTGCTCTGCCTTCTCCF128A-SCATGTTTTCTTGGCTGACACTGGAACGTCF128A-ASGACGTTCCAGTGTCAGCCAAGAAAACATGD135A-SGTTTTCTTGTTTGCCACTGGAACGTCD135A-ASGACGTTCCAGTGGCAAACAAGAAAACR159A-SGACTTCAAGCCATCAGCCCCATTCCGCR159A-ASGCGGAATGGGGCTGATGGCTTGAAGTCR162A-SCACGCCCATTCGCCATTATCTCTGGR162A-ASCCAGAGATAATGGCGAATGGGCGTGD168A-SCTCTGGATCTGCTGATAATACAGTGGD168A-ASCCACTGTATTATCAGCAGATCCAGAGK181A-SGAAGGACCACCATTCGCATTTAAAAGTACK181A-ASGTACTTTTAAATGCGAATGGTGGTCCTTCF182A-SGGACCACCATTCAAAGCTAAAAGTACTTTCGGF182A-ASCCGAAAGTACTTTTAGCTTTGAATGGTGGTCCK191A-SGGAGAACATACGGCATTCGTCCACTCK191A-ASGAGTGGACGAATGCCGTATGTTCTCCF192A-SGAACATACGAAAGCCGTCCACTCTGTGF192A-ASCACAGAGTGGACGGCTTTCGTATGTTCD250A-SCTGGAGCCCGGCTGGTACAAAAATCD250A-ASGATTTTTGTACCAGCCGGGCTCCAGK325A-SGATACGGACACAACGCGGCGATTACTGCK325A-ASGCAGTAATCGCCGCGTTGTGTCCGTATCE345A-SGTGCTGATGCTGCAGGACATATTAACE345A-ASGTTAATATGTCCTGCAGCATCAGCACD469A-SGTTGGTGGACAAGCCTCGAAGGTCCD469A-ASGGACCTTCGAGGCTTGTCCACCAACK538A-SCTTTCCATACCGCCGCGGTTGCATGTGK538A-ASCACATGCAACCGCGGCGGTATGGAAAGa Primers are designated by the mutations followed by S (sense) or AS (antisense) Open table in a new tab Pelleting Assay for F-actin Binding and Depolymerization—A pelleting assay was performed as described previously (15Mohri K. Ono S. J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 4107-4118Google Scholar). Briefly, 10 μm F-actin was incubated with various amounts of proteins in F-buffer (0.1 m KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 20 mm Hepes-NaOH, pH 7.5) for 30 min at room temperature and centrifuged in a TLA-100 rotor (Beckman) at 80,000 rpm for 20 min. The supernatants and pellets were adjusted to the same volumes and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. To quantify the amounts of UNC-78 that were co-sedimented with actin, control experiments were performed without actin, and nonspecific sedimentation of UNC-78 was determined and subtracted from the data of the assays with actin. Gels were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250 (National Diagnostics) and scanned by a UMAX Powerlook III scanner at 300 dots/inch, and band intensity was quantified by Scion Image Beta 4.02 (Scion Corp.). Urea Denaturation Assay—1 μm proteins were incubated with 0–8 m urea solutions containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, 0.2 mm dithiothreitol, pH 8.0, at room temperature for 30 min. Tryptophan fluorescence (excitation at 295 nm and emission at 338 nm) was measured with a fluorescence spectrophotometer LS 50B (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Molecular Graphics—Figures were generated with PyMOL (DeLano Scientific, San Carlos, CA). Structure of UNC-78 —The UNC-78 structure revealed two distinct domains that pack to give an overall appearance of a distorted “figure 8” (Fig. 1A). This organization results in “concave” and “convex” surfaces, which may be relevant to function (see discussion below). Each individual domain is composed of a classic seven-bladed β-propeller first described for the β-subunit of the heterotrimeric G-protein transducin (38Sondek J. Bohm A. Lambright D.G. Hamm H.E. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1996; 379: 369-374Google Scholar). Similar to other seven-bladed propellers, the UNC-78 domains are characterized by a diameter and height of ∼50 and 30 Å, respectively. The two domains exhibit significant structural similarity and can be superimposed with a 2.5-Å r.m.s. deviation for 274 Cα pairs. By convention, the individual blades are numbered from 1 to 14, starting with the N terminus (Fig. 1A). Each blade is composed of a four-stranded antiparallel β-sheet, with the individual strands labeled A to D starting from the center of the propeller (Fig. 1A, middle). The individual sheets exhibit significant twist, such that the A strands run approximately parallel to the propeller axis and form the walls of a solvent-filled central channel (∼12–13 Å in diameter). The strands become progressively more tilted as they radiate from the center of the molecule, with the D strands running approximately perpendicular to the propeller axis. The N-terminal propeller is formed by a continuous chain segment, residues 13–323, which defines blades 1–7, whereas the C-terminal propeller is discontinuous, with two chain segments, residues 1–12 and 324–611, forming blades 8–14. The angular displacement between neighboring blades around the pseudo-7-fold axis deviates from ideality (i.e. 51.4°) varying from 42 to 62° for individual pairs of blades. The 14 blades can be superimposed with r.m.s. deviations of ∼2.0 Å for ∼40 Ca pairs, with the significant structural differences predominately confined to the loops that join the individual β-strands (data not shown). As first observed in the β-subunit transducin (38Sondek J. Bohm A. Lambright D.G. Hamm H.E. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1996; 379: 369-374Google Scholar), the first six blades are formed by a continuous polypeptide segment that contributes strands A–D. Closure of these domains is typically achieved by the utilization of the immediate N terminus as the outer (D) strand for the seventh blade. Prior to the current structure, the only known exception was prolyl oligopeptidase, in which all seven blades are formed by continuous segments, and domain closure is accomplished by considerable hydrophobic interactions between the first and seventh blades (39Fülop V. Bocskei Z. Polgar L. Cell. 1998; 94: 161-170Google Scholar). Notably, both propeller domains in UNC-78 lack the generic mode of domain closure (Fig. 1A, middle and right). Reminiscent of the prolyl oligopeptidase, the N-terminal domain of UNC-78 is stabilized by hydrophobic interactions involving hydrophobic residues from blade 1 (Val22, Val23, Leu24, Ile33, and Val46) and blade 7 (Ile291, Val298, Ile300, and Ile306). The C-terminal propeller in UNC-78 utilizes a variant of the typical closure mechanism, in which the immediate N terminus of the protein stretches across the interdomain interface to form the outer (D) stand of blade 14 (Fig. 1A, right). The distorted “figure 8” organization is the consequence of specific packing interactions along the circumference of the propeller domains. These distortions are manifested in the relative rotations of the two domains around all three axes passing though the center of the molecule (Fig. 1A, left), resulting in a pseudo-2-fold relationship between the domains. The interface is stabilized by several main chain-main chain hydrogen bonds, including Leu9 N-Thr50 O, Leu13 N-His323 O, Arg15 N-Cys36 O, Ala326 O-Ala344 N, and Ile327 N-Gly599 O (Fig. 1B). The side chains of the conserved residues His323, Ser341, and Trp351 participate in hydrogen bonds between blades 7 and 8 to further stabilize the interface (Fig. 1C). As the consequence of the two connecting polypeptide segments, there are a number of conserved residues contributed from blades 1, 7, 8, and 14 that are located in proximity to the interface, although they do not make direct contacts. These residues include Tyr35 and Gly38 of blade 1; Gly304, Gly322, His323, Lys325, and Ile327 of blade 7; Gly346 and Trp351 of blade 8, and Asp601 and Pro14 of blade 14. The validity of this interface is further supported by the observation of a nearly identical organization in the two independent structures of UNC-78 (1NR0 and 1PEV; Table I), which superimpose with an r.m.s. deviation of 0.8 Å over all 610 Cα pairs. Superposition of the individual domains reveals a slight ∼5° rotation between the two domains in the crystal forms, which might be the consequence of packing interactions. Subsequent to the deposition of the UNC-78 structures to the Protein Data Bank, the structure of the homologous Saccharomyces cerevisiae Aip1 structure was reported (40Voegtli W.C. Madrona A.Y. Wilson D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 34373-34379Google Scholar). The C. elegans and S. cerevisiae share 30% sequence identity and exhibit nearly identical topologies, with an r.m.s. deviation of 2.0 Å over 573 Cα pairs. Superposition of individual domains demonstrates subtle differences in overall organization, in which the two domains of the yeast protein are rotated ∼9° toward each other, resulting in a slightly more closed arrangement than observed in the C. elegans protein (Fig. 1D). The independent structure of the yeast protein supports a widely conserved overall structural organization and further suggests some interdomain variability, which might be important for function. Activity of GST-UNC-78 —We previously reported purification of bacterially expressed UNC-78 without a fusion tag sequence (15Mohri K. Ono S. J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 4107-4118Google Scholar). We found that UNC-78 could be expressed in E. coli as a soluble fusion protein with GST and rapidly purified by glutathione affinity chromatography. Although a thrombin recognition sequence was present at the junction between GST and UNC-78, thrombin failed to cleave GST from UNC-78 (data not shown). GST-UNC-78 disassembled F-actin only in the presence of UNC-60B (Fig. 2A, compare the amounts of actin in the supernatants in lanes 3 and 9) in the same manner as untagged UNC-78 (Fig. 2A, compare lanes 1 and 7). GST alone did not interact with F-actin in the absence (Fig. 2A, lanes 5 and 6) or the presence of UNC-60B (Fig. 2A, lanes 11 and 12). Quantitative analysis of the pelleting assays indicated that GST-UNC-78 disassembled UNC-60B-bound F-actin to the same extent as untagged UNC-78 (Fig. 2B). These results strongly suggest that GST-UNC-78 has indistinguishable activity from UNC-78 with no tag. Therefore, we used GST-UNC-78 as a template of the following mutagenesis study and tested the activity of mutants as GST fusion proteins. Identification of Conserved Surface Residues of UNC-78 — Based on functional conservation among the AIP1 proteins from different species, we reasoned that conserved solvent-accessible residues were likely to play a direct role in AIP1 function. Alignment of thirteen AIP1 sequences using the Clustal method (Supplemental Fig. 1), in conjunction with solvent accessibility calculated from the UNC-78 crystal structure, allowed for the identification of the desired class of residues. As pointed out by Voegtli et al. (40Voegtli W.C. Madrona A.Y. Wilson D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 34373-34379Google Scholar), we also"

Site II mutations that allow high affinity binding to site I, but only low affinity binding to site II, show that retardation of isotopic exchange requires higher Ca2+ concentrations with the N796A mutant, and is not observed with the E309Q mutant even at millimolar Ca2+. Fluoroaluminate forms a complex at the catalytic site yielding stable analogs of the phosphoenzyme intermediate, with properties similar to E2-P or E1-P·Ca2. Mutational analysis indicates that Asp351, Lys352, Thr353, Asp703, Asn706, Asp707, Thr625, and Lys684 participate in stabilization of fluoroaluminate and Mg2+ at the phosphorylation site. In the presence of fluoroaluminate and Ca2+, ADP (or AMP-PCP) favors formation of a stable ADP·E1-P·Ca2 analog. This produces strong occlusion of Ca2+ bound to both sites (I and II), whereby dissociation occurs very slowly even following addition of EGTA. Occlusion by fluoraluminate and ADP is not observed with the E309Q mutant, suggesting a gating function of Glu309 at the mouth of a binding cavity with a single path of entry. This phenomenon corresponds to the earliest step of the catalytic cycle following utilization of ATP.

The sarcoendoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase (SERCA) 1The abbreviations used are: SERCA, sarcoplasmic reticulum ATPase; SR, sarcoplasmic reticulum; WT, wild type; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid; TG, thapsigargin; AMP-PCP, adenosine 5′-(β,γ-methylenetriphosphate); PSPase, phosphoserine phosphatase; AMP-PNP, adenosine 5′-(β,γ-imino)triphosphate. is a ubiquitous Ca2+ pump, required for intracellular Ca2+ storing and Ca2+ signaling mechanisms. The SERCA1 isoform is a 994-amino acid protein that includes 10 transmembrane segments and a cytosolic headpiece comprising three (N, P, and A) distinct domains (1MacLennan D.H. Brandl C.J. Korczak B. Green N.M. Nature. 1985; 316: 696-700Google Scholar, 2Toyoshima C. Nakasko M. Nomura H. Ogawa H. Nature. 2000; 406: 647-655Google Scholar). The reaction sequence (Scheme I) of the catalytic and transport cycle (3de Meis L. Vianna A.L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1979; 48: 275-292Google Scholar) includes high affinity binding of 2 Ca2+, ATP binding, formation of a phosphorylated intermediate, release of ADP, isomerization of the phosphorylated intermediate from a state of high affinity (E1-P·Ca2) to a state of low affinity for Ca2+ (E2-P·Ca2), vectorial dissociation of bound Ca2+, and finally, hydrolytic cleavage of phosphate. The initial binding of two Ca2+ (in exchange for H+) occurs sequentially (4Inesi G. Kurzmack M. Coan C. Lewis D. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 3025-3031Google Scholar, 5Dupont Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1982; 688: 75-87Google Scholar, 6Orlowski S. Champeil P. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 352-361Google Scholar) and involves two neighboring sites (I and II) within the ATPase membrane region where stabilization is provided by amino acid residues deriving from the M4, M5, M6, and M8 transmembrane helices (2Toyoshima C. Nakasko M. Nomura H. Ogawa H. Nature. 2000; 406: 647-655Google Scholar, 7Clarke D.M. Loo T.W. Inesi G. MacLennan D.H. Nature. 1989; 339: 476-478Google Scholar). On the other hand, binding and catalytic utilization of ATP occurs within the cytosolic headpiece of the enzyme with direct or indirect intervention of several residues of the N, P, and A domains. In the absence of ATP, the two bound Ca2+ undergo rapid reverse dissociation when the Ca2+ concentration in the medium is lowered by the addition of EGTA (6Orlowski S. Champeil P. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 352-361Google Scholar). However, upon addition of ATP, occlusion (i.e. lack of reverse dissociation) of the two bound Ca2+ is observed upon enzyme phosphorylation (8Inesi G. Kurzmack M. Verjovski-Almeida S. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1978; 307: 224-227Google Scholar, 9Dupont Y. Eur. J. Biochem. 1980; 109: 231-238Google Scholar). It was previously reported (10Troullier A. Girardet J.L. Dupont Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 22821-22829Google Scholar) that incubation of ATPase with fluoroaluminate yields an ATPase complex with characteristics attributed to E2-P or E1-P·Ca2 enzyme intermediates. We have therefore studied the reverse dissociation and exchange of bound Ca2+ in the absence of ATP, and the Ca2+ dissociation following formation of a phosphoenzyme analog with fluoroaluminate. In addition, we performed a mutational analysis of the Ca2+ binding site and the catalytic domain, to clarify the role of various residues in stabilization of fluoroaluminate and in the mechanism of Ca2+ occlusion. Native sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) vesicles were obtained by homogenization and differential centrifugation of rabbit white muscle (11Eletr S. Inesi G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1972; 282: 174-179Google Scholar). Recombinant ATPase protein was obtained with the microsomal fraction of COS-1 cells infected with adenovirus vectors carrying WT or mutated (chicken or rabbit) SERCA1 cDNA. The methods for construction of vectors, cultures, and preparation of microsomes were previously described in detail (12Zhang Z. Lewis D. Inesi G. Nakasako M. Nomura H. Toyoshima C. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 8758-8767Google Scholar). The total microsomal protein was determined using bicinchoninic acid with the biuret reaction (Pierce). In all experiments with recombinant ATPase, the total protein concentrations in reaction mixtures, or the experimental results, were adjusted to reflect comparable SERCA concentrations as determined by Western blotting. Contaminant Ca2+ in various reaction mixtures was estimated by titration with EGTA in the presence of metallochromic indicators in a double wavelength spectrophotometer. Ca2+ dependent hydrolytic activity and Ca2+ transport were measured as previously described (13Ma H. Inesi G. Toyoshima C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 28938-28943Google Scholar). Ca2+ binding at equilibrium was measured by incubating SR vesicles (40 μg/ml) or COS-1 cell microsomes (60 μg/ml) in reaction mixtures containing 20 mm MOPS, pH 7.0, 80 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EGTA, [45Ca]CaCl2 to yield various concentrations of free Ca2+ (14Fabiato A. Fabiato F. J. Physiol. 1978; 276: 233-255Google Scholar), and 5 μm A23187 calcium ionophore. Thapsigargin (TG) was added to half of the samples (1 μm) to provide controls exhibiting no specific Ca2+ binding. Following 15 min incubation at 25 °C, 1-ml samples were filtered by suction on 0.45-μm Millipore filters, and the filters were collected, blotted, and processed for scintillation counting. The time course of [45Ca]Ca2+ dissociation from the ATPase, was determined by first incubating SR vesicles (40 μg/ml) or COS-1 cell microsomes (100 μg/ml) in a medium containing 50 mm MOPS, pH 7.0, 80 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 5 μm A23187 calcium ionophore, and 20 μm [45Ca]Ca2+ (including contaminant Ca2+). TG was added to half of the samples (1 μm) to provide controls exhibiting no specific Ca2+ binding. Following 10 min incubation at 25 °C, 1-ml samples were placed on a 0.65-μm Millipore filter and the medium was removed by suction. The vesicles were then perfused with the same medium, but containing 10 mm EGTA for dissociation of bound [45Ca]Ca2+, or various concentrations of [40Ca]Ca2+ for exchange with bound [45Ca]Ca2+. The experiments were performed in a BioLogic rapid filtration apparatus, and increasing perfusion times were applied to individual samples. The filters were then collected, blotted, and processed for scintillation counting. Controls with TG were obtained for each perfusion time. Reaction with fluoroaluminate to test ATPase inhibition was obtained by incubating SR vesicles (0.06 mg/ml) in media containing 40 mm MOPS, pH 7.0, 80 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 2 μm A23187 Ca2+ ionophore, 1 mm EGTA, 2 mm potassium fluoride, and various concentrations (0–50 μm) of AlCl3, in the presence or absence of 0.95 mm CaCl2. The incubation was carried out for 30 min at 25 °C, and the samples were then used directly for ATPase measurements by adding 0.95 mm Ca2+ (when Ca2+ was not present), and ATP (1 mm). Reaction with fluoroaluminate to determine Ca2+ binding or dissociation of bound Ca2+ from the ATPase was obtained by incubating SR vesicles with [45Ca]Ca2+ as explained above, but with the addition of 2 mm potassium fluoride and 5 or 50 μm AlCl3, in the absence or presence of various concentrations of ADP or AMP-PCP. Following 30 min incubation at 25 °C, 1-ml samples were placed on a 0.65-μm Millipore filter and the medium was removed by suction. The filters were then processed for determination of bound calcium. Alternatively, the vesicles were perfused with the same medium as for preincubation, but containing 10 mm EGTA for dissociation of bound [45Ca]Ca2+. The experiments were performed in a BioLogic rapid filtration apparatus, and increasing perfusion times were applied to individual samples. The filters were then collected, blotted, and processed for scintillation counting. Controls with TG were obtained for each perfusion time. For the experiments on limited proteolytic digestion, microsomes containing recombinant (chicken or rabbit) ATPase were preincubated for 40 min at 25 °C in media containing 50 mm MOPS, pH 7.0, 50 mm NaCl, 1.2 mg of microsomal protein/ml, and 2.0 mm EGTA, in the presence or absence of 2.1 mm CaCl2, 5 mm MgCl2, 2 mm NaF, 5 or 50 μm AlCl3, and 0.1 mm ADP. After 60 min, limited proteolytic digestion was started by the addition of either 0.04 mg of proteinase K or 0.012 mg of trypsin/ml. The reaction was quenched after 50 min of digestion by the addition of trichloroacetic acid to reach a 2.5% final concentration. The quenched protein was then solubilized by adding sodium dodecyl sulfate (1%), Tris (0.312 m), pH 6.8, sucrose (3.75%), β-mercaptoethanol (1.25 mm), and bromphenol blue (0.025%). The samples were then subjected to electrophoretic analysis (15Laemmli U.K. Beguin F. Gujer-Kellenberger G. J. Mol. Biol. 1970; 47: 69-85Google Scholar) on 12% gels followed by staining with Coomassie Blue. Western blots were obtained with monoclonal antibody CaF3–5C3 for chicken SERCA-1 or MA911 for rabbit SERCA1, followed by goat anti-mouse IgG horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies and visualization with an enhanced chemiluminescence-linked detection system (Amersham Biosciences). Ca2+ Binding and Dissociation in the Absence of ATP— Equilibrium binding of Ca2+ to the native ATPase of SR vesicles has been previously observed within the micromolar concentration range (4Inesi G. Kurzmack M. Coan C. Lewis D. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 3025-3031Google Scholar). However, measurements of Ca2+ binding to recombinant ATPase are more difficult because of low concentrations of the enzyme in COS-1 cell microsomes, and restrictive conditions required for subsequent kinetic experiments (i.e. filtration and low Ca2+/EGTA concentrations, as opposed to column chromatography and high Ca2+/EGTA buffer). Under our present conditions, we obtained equilibrium binding isotherms that yield a maximal stoichiometry of two Ca2+ per ATPase, and are best fitted with a cooperative equation assuming Keq values of 7 × 105 and 2 × 106m-1 for two interacting sites (16Inesi G. Zhang Z. Lewis D. Biophys. J. 2002; 83: 2327-2332Google Scholar). Identical values, adjusted for the ATPase molar concentration, are obtained with native and recombinant WT enzyme. Dissociation of bound Ca2+ was studied by preincubating microsomes with 20 μm [45Ca]Ca2+ for 15 min, which results in saturation the high affinity binding sites (2 Ca2+/ATPase). We placed preincubated SR vesicles on filters for removal of the medium by suction, and subjected them to perfusion with 10 mm EGTA and no added calcium (2 × 10-10m free Ca2+) for various time intervals in the rapid filtration apparatus. We found that, following addition of EGTA, most of the bound calcium dissociates with a 21–26 s-1 rate constant (Fig. 1), whereas ∼10% of the total signal dissociates slightly slower (see also Ref. 6Orlowski S. Champeil P. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 352-361Google Scholar). It is apparent that under these conditions the bound Ca2+ dissociates rapidly and the two sites cannot be distinguished. Contrary to dissociation in the presence of EGTA, isotopic exchange of bound [45Ca]Ca2+ following addition of [40Ca]Ca2+ (6Orlowski S. Champeil P. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 352-361Google Scholar) yields two distinct kinetic components. We studied the [40Ca]Ca2+ concentration dependence of isotopic exchange with regard to rate constants as well as the size of the two kinetic components. We found that in the presence of [40Ca]Ca2+ concentrations in the micromolar range the [45Ca]Ca2+ dissociation curve exhibits a component approximately as fast as that observed in the presence of EGTA (kd = 16–18 s-1), corresponding to 75–80% of the total signal, and a definitely slower component (kd = 1 s-1), corresponding to 20–25% of the total signal. On the other hand, when the [40Ca]Ca2+ concentration is raised up to the millimolar range, the size of the slow component of [45Ca]Ca2+ increases to a maximum of 50% of the total signal, whereas its rate constant is reduced to 0.01–0.02 s-1 (Fig. 1 and Table I). No further change in the size of the two components is obtained by increasing the [40Ca]Ca2+ concentration above 1 mm. Considering that the stoichiometry of [45Ca]Ca2+ bound is 2 per ATPase, it is clear that in the presence of millimolar Ca2+ the initial dissociation (and exchange) of one Ca2+ occurs unimpeded, whereas dissociation of the remaining Ca2+ is strongly retarded. This indicates that [40Ca]Ca2+ occupancy of one site produces retardation of exchange on the other site.Table IPercentage of bound Ca2+ undergoing slow isotopic exchange, and rate constants of fast and slow exchange components (see legend toFig. 1)[Ca2+]Slowkfastkslow%s-11 × 10-6m18 ± 816 ± 41.05 ± 0.215 × 10-6m21 ± 1214 ± 30.55 ± 0.112 × 10-5m31 ± 318 ± 40.51 ± 0.081 × 10-4m36 ± 416 ± 20.15 ± 0.021 × 10-3m48 ± 315 ± 40.02 ± 0.0110 × 10-3m52 ± 316 ± 30.01 ± 0.02 Open table in a new tab Effects of Site-directed Mutations—Consistent with the cooperative mechanism, single mutations in site I interfere with Ca2+ binding on both sites I and II, even when the residue undergoing mutation does not participate directly in Ca2+ binding at site II (17Strock C. Cavagna M. Peiffer W.E. Sumbilla C. Lewis D. Inesi G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15104-15109Google Scholar). On the other hand, high affinity binding (Keq = 106m-1) of one Ca2+ on site I is still retained following single mutations on site II (i.e. E309Q or N796A), whereas site II looses high affinity binding (16Inesi G. Zhang Z. Lewis D. Biophys. J. 2002; 83: 2327-2332Google Scholar). Consequently, no binding to site II is observed at micromolar Ca2+ concentrations. We found that, following addition of EGTA, Ca2+ dissociation from these mutants (i.e. from site I) occurs with a single rate constant of 2–4 s-1 (Fig 2, A and B). This is significantly slower than observed with the WT enzyme, and may reflect additional stabilization of Ca2+ in site I by oxygen functions of site II. For instance, the Asp800 side chain, which contributes one oxygen function to site I and one oxygen function to site II in the WT enzyme, is likely to contribute both its oxygen functions to site I in the site II mutants. We measured calcium isotope exchange in the two mutants N796A and E309Q. As explained above, Asn796 and Glu309 residues contribute side chain oxygen atoms for Ca2+ complexation on site II. Therefore, while retaining high affinity Ca2+ binding to site I, these mutants loose high affinity Ca2+ binding to site II. On the other hand, low affinity binding is still retained by the altered site II, as suggested by inhibition of enzyme phosphorylation with Pi (18Andersen J.P. Vilsen B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 19383-19387Google Scholar). We then tested if addition of [40Ca]Ca2+ would result in isotopic exchange with [45Ca]Ca2+ bound to site I. We found that the two mutants exhibit a different behavior, as dissociation (i.e. isotopic exchange) of bound [45Ca]Ca2+ is increasingly retarded by [40Ca]Ca2+ within the 0.1–1.0 mm range in the N796A mutant (Fig. 2A), whereas the E309Q mutant exhibits dissociation as rapid as that observed in the presence of EGTA even following addition of 1 mm [40Ca]Ca2+ (Fig. 2B). This indicates that Glu309 makes a greater contribution than Asn796 to the affinity of site II for Ca2+. Therefore, the Glu309 side chain plays a very important role in retardation of Ca2+ dissociation from site I and in capping the calcium binding cavity. Formation of Fluoroaluminate-ATPase Complex—Intrinsic fluorescence and Ca2+ binding measurements were previously reported (10Troullier A. Girardet J.L. Dupont Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 22821-22829Google Scholar) indicating that incubation of ATPase with fluoroaluminate yields a fluoroaluminate-ATPase complex with characteristics attributed to the E2-P or E1-P·Ca2 enzyme intermediate. In our experiments, we tested the formation of stable intermediate analogs by incubating the ATPase with various concentrations of fluoroaluminate in the absence or presence of Ca2+, and then measured the residual Ca2+-dependent ATPase activity. It is shown in Fig. 3 that ATPase inactivation occurs in either case, but higher concentrations of fluoroaluminate are required when the incubation is carried out in the presence of Ca2+. This demonstrates that a stable complex is formed in either case, most likely corresponding to E2-P in the absence of Ca2+, and to E1-P·Ca2 in the presence of Ca2+. Formation of the latter analog requires higher fluoroaluminate concentrations. We also explored whether formation of the fluoroaluminate complex would produce the ATPase conformational changes as expected of phosphoenzyme intermediate formation. For this purpose we conducted experiments using partial digestion with proteinase K or trypsin, which may reveal protection of specific sites on the peptide loops intervening between the A domain and the M3 transmembrane segment. This protection is observed following reaction of the ATPase with phosphate analogs, suggesting large conformational changes that include various degrees of A domain rotation and gathering of the cytosolic domains (19Danko S. Yamasaki K. Daiho T. Suzuki H. Toyoshima C. FEBS Lett. 2001; 505: 129-135Google Scholar). Accordingly we found that, although the pattern of digestion by proteinase K is different in the absence or presence of Ca2+, protection is obtained following reaction with 50 μm fluoroaluminate in either case (Fig. 4). In fact even Mg2+ makes little difference, indicating that while Mg2+ is required for electrophilic assistance in the catalytic mechanism, its contribution to steric stabilization of fluoroaluminate is not apparent in our experiments with WT enzyme. On the other hand, following mutation of residues (i.e. Asp601, Lys352, Asn706, and Lys684) that contribute to fluoroaluminate stabilization in the WT enzyme (see below and Table II), the Mg2+ contribution to stabilization of the complex becomes apparent.Table IIEffects of various mutations on ATPase and Ca2+ transport activity and nucleotide (1 mm AMP-PCP) or aluminum fluoride (50 μm) protection from digestion with proteinase K Activity was measured with ATP (1 mm) or acetylphosphate (5 mm) as the substrate, in the presence of Mg2+ (5 mm) and Ca2+ (0.1 mm). Nucleotide and aluminum fluoride protection was measured in the absence or presence of Ca2+ and/or Mg2+ as indicated. Protection was evaluated from the type of disappearance of the ATPase band on electrophoretic gels (see Figs. 4 and 5). The values pertinent to mutants are given in fractional values of controls obtained with WT protein under the same conditions, and are averages of three to four experiments.

In fact, protection from trypsin (as opposed to proteinase K) is obtained when the reaction with fluoroaluminate is performed in the absence of Ca2+, but not in the presence of Ca2+ (Fig. 5, A and B). These results are consistent with conformational changes because of the fluoroaluminate reaction, and a significantly different A domain rotation in the E2-P and E1-P·Ca2 analogs allowing protection of the Arg198 trypsin site only in the former analog. Furthermore, it is shown in Fig. 5C that, in the presence of Ca2+, low fluoroaluminate concentrations (5 μm) afford only partial protection from proteinase K. In this case, addition of ADP produces total protection, as acquisition of the ADP·E1-P·Ca2 conformation is highly favored. It is noteworthy that formation of the E2-P analog is not influenced by ADP, as complete protection is already observed with 5 μm fluoroaluminate. We found that protection is not observed at all when the fluoroaluminate reaction is carried out with the D351N or D351A mutants (Table II). Considering that Asp351 is the residue involved directly in the phosphorylation reaction, the lack of reactivity of Asp351 mutants demonstrates unambiguously that the fluoroaluminate complex obtained with the WT enzyme is in fact a phosphoenzyme analog. It is remarkable that the same Asp351 mutations favor protection by nucleotide binding, while interfering with protection by fluoroaluminate (see “Discussion”). We then performed a mutational analysis of several residues whose involvement in substrate binding and/or utilization was indicated by previous studies with SERCA (2Toyoshima C. Nakasko M. Nomura H. Ogawa H. Nature. 2000; 406: 647-655Google Scholar, 13Ma H. Inesi G. Toyoshima C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 28938-28943Google Scholar) or with the highly analogous phosphoserine phosphatase (PSPase) enzyme (20Wang W. Cho H.S. Kim R. Jankaric J. Yokota H. Nguyen H.H. Gregoriev I.V. Wemmer D.E. Kim S.H. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 319: 421-431Google Scholar). All of these mutations produce catalytic inhibition when either ATP or acetylphosphate are used as the substrate (Table II). A special case is the R560A mutant in which a greater inhibition of ATP utilization is observed, evidently because of a prevalent role of Arg560 in ATP (13Ma H. Inesi G. Toyoshima C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 28938-28943Google Scholar), as compared with acetylphosphate binding. It is noteworthy that derivatization of Lys515 (N domain) with fluoroisothiocyanate produces total inhibition of ATP utilization, while allowing partial utilization of acetylphosphate (not shown). Various mutations within the P domain interfere with nucleotide or fluoroaluminate protection from proteinase K (Table II). This is the case of K352A, T353A, T625A, K684A, D703A, N706A, and D707A. It is noteworthy that the Thr353, Asp707, and Thr625 mutations have approximately the same degree of interference with fluoroaluminate protection in the absence or presence of Ca2+ and/or Mg2+. On the other hand, interference by the Lys352, Asp703, Asn706, and Lys684 mutations is relieved to some extent by the presence of Mg2+. Furthermore, in the K684A, N706A, and D703A mutants the effect of Mg2+ is much more prominent when Ca2+ is also present, suggesting a different contribution of fluoroaluminate stabilization by these residues in the E1-P·Ca2 as compared with the E2-P conformation. Mutation of Gly626 has very little effect on protection by fluoroaluminate, although it interferes with protection by nucleotide and produces catalytic inhibition. A case of special interest is the N706A mutation that, in analogy to the Asp351 mutation, favors protection by nucleotide (see “Discussion”) while interfering with protection by fluoroaluminate only in the presence of Ca2+. This interference is totally relieved by Mg2+ (Table II). The Asn706 mutation produces complete inhibition of catalytic activity (see “Discussion”). Mutations of Arg560, Glu439, Arg489 (N domain), Arg174, and Glu183 (A domain) do not interfere significantly with fluoroaluminate protection from proteinase K, indicating that these residues do not contribute to stabilization of fluoraluminate. On the other hand, interference of nucleotide protection is produced by the Arg560 and Glu439 (but not Arg489) mutations, suggesting that these residues are involved in nucleotide binding (13Ma H. Inesi G. Toyoshima C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 28938-28943Google Scholar). Ca2+ Binding and Dissociation in the Fluoroaluminate-ATPase Complex—To study Ca2+ dissociation from the fluoroaluminate complex, we first obtained a preliminary assessment of Ca2+ binding when the ATPase is incubated for 30 min in the presence of 20 μm Ca2+ with fluoroaluminate at concentrations yielding enzyme inactivation (Fig. 3). We found that when the ATPase is incubated in the presence of 20 μm [45Ca]Ca2+ in the absence or presence of fluoroaluminate, the maximal level of high affinity Ca2+ binding (2 Ca2+-ATPase) is reduced to 85% if 5 μm fluoroaluminate is present, and to 60% if 50 μm fluoroaluminate is present (Table III). This reduction is evidently related to formation of the E2-P analog that does not retain high affinity binding, and accounts for 15 and 40% following incubation with 5 or 50 μm fluoroaluminate, respectively (Table III).Table IIIMaximal level of Ca2+ bound, rates of Ca2+ dissociation, and distribution of enzyme states in the absence or presence of fluoroaluminate and ADP See Figs. 6 and 7.FluoroaluminateCa2+ boundDissociationE1·Ca2E1·AlF3·Ca2E2·AlF3FastSlow0100%90%10%100%5 μm85%61%39%52%33%15%50 μm60%21%79%13%47%40%5 μm and 5 μm ADP100%100%100% Open table in a new tab When we studied the time course of Ca2+ dissociation from the fluoroaluminate-ATPase upon addition of EGTA, we found a fast and a slow kinetic component, occurring with 20–30 s-1 and 0.3–0.4 s-1 rate constants (Fig. 6). It is apparent that the fast dissociation is quite similar to that observed in the absence of fluoroaluminate (E1-Ca2), whereas the slow component is likely because of formation of the fluoroaluminate-ATPase complex (i.e. E1-P·Ca2) and consequent occlusion of bound Ca2+. The sizes of the fast and slow components differ depending on the fluoroaluminate concentration: 58 and 42% of the observed signal in the ATPase incubated with 5 μm fluoroaluminate; 25 and 75% in the ATPase incubated with 50 μm fluoroaluminate. Considering that Ca2+ binding is reduced to 85 or 60% by 5 or 50 μm fluoroaluminate, respectively, we conclude that incubation with 5 μm fluoroaluminate yields 15% E2-P (no Ca2+ bound), 52% E1-Ca2+ (rapid dissociation), and 33% E1-P·Ca2 (slow dissociation). On the other hand, incubation with 50 μm fluoroaluminate yields 40% E2-P (no bound Ca2+), 13% E1-Ca2 (rapid dissociation), and 47% E1-P·Ca2 (slow dissociation). These levels are summarized in Table III. Because ADP favors formation of the E1-P·Ca2 analog (Fig. 5C), we tested whether dissociation of bound Ca2+ would be also affected. We found that addition of ADP to the incubation mixture with a fluoroaluminate concentration as low as 5 μm allowed 100% Ca2+ binding. In addition, it produced to"

To elucidate β-cell dysfunction, PDX1 was suppressed by transduction of rat islets with an adenoviral construct encoding a dominant negative form of PDX1. After 2 days, there was a marked inhibition of insulin secretion in response to glucose, leucine, and arginine. Increasing cAMP levels with forskolin and isobutylmethylxanthine restored glucose-stimulated insulin secretion, indicating normal capacity for exocytosis. To identify molecular targets implicated in the altered metabolism secretion coupling, DNA microarray analysis was performed on PDX1-deficient and control islets. Of the 2640 detected transcripts, 70 were up-regulated and 56 were down-regulated. Transcripts were subdivided into 12 clusters; the most prevalent were associated with metabolism. Quantitative reverse transcriptase-PCR confirmed increases in succinate dehydrogenase and ATP synthase mRNAs as well as pyruvate carboxylase and the transcript for the malate shuttle. In parallel there was a 50% reduction in mRNA levels for the mitochondrially encoded nd1 gene, a subunit of the NADH dehydrogenase comprising complex I of the mitochondrial respiratory chain. As a consequence, total cellular ATP concentration was drastically decreased by 75%, and glucose failed to augment cytosolic ATP, explaining the blunted glucose-stimulated insulin secretion. Rotenone, an inhibitor of complex I, mimicked this effect. Surprisingly, TFAM, a nuclear-encoded transcription factor important for sustaining expression of mitochondrial genes, was down-regulated in islets expressing DN79PDX1. In conclusion, loss of PDX1 function alters expression of mitochondrially encoded genes through regulation of TFAM leading to impaired insulin secretion.

Type 2 diabetes mellitus is a common severe disease of intermediary metabolism usually caused by both β-cell dysfunction and resistance to the biological actions of insulin on its main target tissues (liver, muscle, and fat). The susceptibility for type 2 diabetes is inherited, but single diabetes genes have only been identified in about 5% of cases. Mutations in one of these genes, the homeodomain transcription factor ipf1 (also known as, pdx1, idx1, or stf1), have been associated with a rare form of maturity onset diabetes of the young (MODY4) 1The abbreviations used are: MODY, maturity onset diabetes of the young; PDX1, pancreatic duodenal homeobox 1; OXPHOS, oxidative phosphorylation; IBMX, isobutylmethylxanthine; RT, reverse transcriptase. 1The abbreviations used are: MODY, maturity onset diabetes of the young; PDX1, pancreatic duodenal homeobox 1; OXPHOS, oxidative phosphorylation; IBMX, isobutylmethylxanthine; RT, reverse transcriptase. as well as predisposing individuals to late onset type 2 diabetes (1Stoffers D.A.

Furthermore, homozygous null mutations in the ipf1 gene result in pancreas agenesis indicating that this transcription factor is indispensable for both pancreas development and subsequent β-cell function (6Stoffers D.A.

Michielin O. Melloul D. Philippe J. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 2003; 88: 4398-4406Google Scholar). As in humans, inactivation of both pdx1 alleles in murine models results in pancreas agenesis, whereas heterozygous mice or animals carrying a β-cell-specific deletion of the gene exhibit impaired glucose tolerance (8Jonsson J. Carlsson L. Edlund T. Edlund H. Nature. 1994; 371: 606-609Google Scholar, 9Lottmann H. Vanselow J. Hessabi B. Walther R. J. Mol. Med. 2001; 79: 321-328Google Scholar, 10Thomas M.K. Devon O.N.

Wright C.V. Development (Camb.). 1996; 122: 983-995Google Scholar). Several of these models also develop overt diabetes with age indicating a progressive deterioration of β-cell function and/or mass. A recent study concluded that reduction in PDX1 expression impedes primarily β-cell function such as NAD(P)H generation, mitochondrial metabolism, and/or mobilization of intracellular calcium (12Brissova M. Shiota M. Nicholson W.E. Gannon M. Knobel S.M. Piston D.W. Wright C.V. Powers A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 11225-11232Google Scholar) rather than β-cell mass. In contrast, another publication (13Johnson J.D. Ahmed N.T. Luciani D.S. Han Z. Tran H. Fujita J. Misler S. Edlund H. Polonsky K.S. J. Clin. Investig. 2003; 111: 1147-1160Google Scholar) demonstrates that the metabolism secretion coupling (glucose sensing, NADH formation, and calcium currents) was normal in Pdx1+/– β-cells. However, β-cells in aging mice were more susceptible to apoptosis, with reduced expression of anti-apoptotic genes such as BclXL and Bcl-2, as compared with control islets. This study concluded that decreased β-cell mass rather than function is the key mechanism whereby PDX1 deficiency leads to impaired blood glucose regulation and to progressive age-dependent development of diabetes (13Johnson J.D. Ahmed N.T. Luciani D.S. Han Z. Tran H. Fujita J. Misler S. Edlund H. Polonsky K.S. J. Clin. Investig. 2003; 111: 1147-1160Google Scholar). The two investigations highlight the profound regulatory complexity that PDX1 impinges on β-cell function and/or survival. The direct contribution of PDX1 on these two potential nonmutually exclusive physiological processes remains to be elucidated. Whereas PDX1 is clearly a central player in pancreas development and subsequent β-cell function, relatively few bona fide PDX1 target genes have been identified. Most interesting, although PDX1 was found to be one of the main transcription factors mediating the stimulatory effect of glucose on insulin gene expression, its impact on constitutive expression of the hormone in vivo remains controversial (12Brissova M. Shiota M. Nicholson W.E. Gannon M. Knobel S.M. Piston D.W. Wright C.V. Powers A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 11225-11232Google Scholar, 14Melloul D. Marshak S. Cerasi E. Diabetologia. 2002; 45: 309-326Google Scholar). Similarly, conflicting results have been reported for the regulation of glucokinase gene expression by the transcription factor (12Brissova M. Shiota M. Nicholson W.E. Gannon M. Knobel S.M. Piston D.W. Wright C.V. Powers A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 11225-11232Google Scholar, 15Watada H. Kajimoto Y. Miyagawa J.-I. Hanafusa T. Hamaguchi K.

J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 25279-25286Google Scholar). In contrast, PDX1 has been consistently shown to regulate transcription of GLUT2, IAPP, and FGFR1 in β-cells as well as somatostatin in δ-cells (17Waeber G. Thompson N. Nicod P. Bonny C. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 1327-1334Google Scholar, 18Miller C.P. McGehee Jr., R.E. Habener J.F. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1145-1156Google Scholar, 19Serup P. Jensen J. Andersen F.G. Jorgensen M.C. Blume N.

Identification of additional PDX1-regulated genes in β-cells could reveal novel targets directly implicated in either impaired insulin secretion and/or apoptosis associated with the MODY4 phenotype. DNA microarray technology has become a powerful tool to decipher the complex genetic networks altered in response to environmental insults and disease. Here we use this technology to study the impact of PDX1 on β-cell physiology by comparing global gene profiles of islets infected with a viral vector expressing a dominant negative variant of PDX1 (AdRIPDN79PDX1) to control LacZ-infected islets. We identified 94 genes and 32 ESTs that reached a greater than 1.6-fold increase or decrease in expression levels after infection with AdRIPDN79PDX1. Most interesting, expression of the mitochondrially encoded nd1 gene, a subunit of the respiratory chain complex I, NADH dehydrogenase, was decreased by 2-fold. Possibly through a compensatory mechanism, there was increased expression of succinate dehydrogenase and ATP synthase (complex II and V, respectively) as well as genes involved in the anaplerosis pathway. Decreased total cellular ATP as well as a refractory increase in glucose-induced ATP synthesis accompanied these alterations. Moreover the nuclear-encoded transcription factor TFAM, which maintains mitochondrial gene expression, was down-regulated by DN79PDX1. Our study provides a novel role of PDX1 in mitochondrial metabolism through regulation of mitochondrial genes. Rat Islet Isolation and Culture—7-Week-old male Wistar rats (250 g) were purchased from Elevage Janvier (Le Genest-St-Isle, France). Pancreatic islets were isolated by collagenase digestion, handpicked, and maintained in 11.1 mm glucose/RPMI 1640 (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Brunschwig AG, Basel, Switzerland), 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin (Sigma) (21Ishihara H. Wang H. Drewes L.R. Wollheim C.B. J. Clin. Investig. 1999; 104: 1621-1629Google Scholar). Recombinant Adenoviral Construction and Islet Transduction—The mouse DN79PDX1 cDNA lacking the transactivation domain of PDX1 (amino acids 1–79) was kindly provided by Dr. H. Wang (16Wang H. Maechler P. Ritz-Laser B. Hagenfeldt K.A. Ishihara H. Philippe J. Wollheim C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 25279-25286Google Scholar). The recombinant adenovirus AdRIPDN79PDX1 harboring the rat insulin 1 promoter and coding sequence of DN79PDX1 was constructed as described previously (22Miyake S. Makimura M. Kanegae Y. Harada S. Sato Y. Takamori K. Tokuda C. Saito I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 1320-1324Google Scholar). AdCAlacZ, containing the bacterial β-galactosidase cDNA, was used as a control adenovirus (21Ishihara H. Wang H. Drewes L.R. Wollheim C.B. J. Clin. Investig. 1999; 104: 1621-1629Google Scholar). Eighteen hours post-isolation, islets were infected with various amounts of recombinant adenoviruses (AdCaLacZ, 17 × 105 viral particles/islet and 4 and 17 × 105 viral particles/islet for AdRIPDN79PDX1) for 90 min, washed, and cultured in RPMI medium for an additional 48 h. Nuclear Extract Preparation and Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay—Nuclear protein extracts were prepared from AdCaLacZ or AdRIPDN79PDX1-infected islets according to the protocol of Schreiber et al. (23Schreiber E. Matthias P. Muller M. Schaffner W. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 4221-4229Google Scholar). A double-strand oligonucleotide corresponding to the FARFLAT element of the rat insulin 1 promoter was radioactively labeled by filling in the ends using the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase I in the presence of [α-32P]dCTP and purified using the QIAquick nucleotide removal kit (Qiagen AG, Basel, CH). DNA binding assays were performed as described previously (24Gauthier B.R. Schwitzgebel V.M. Zaiko M. Mamin A. Ritz-Laser B. Philippe J. Mol. Endocrinol. 2002; 16: 170-183Google Scholar). Immunoblot Analysis—Nuclear protein extracts (10 and 20 μg) were resolved on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and transferred electrophoretically to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. The membrane was blocked with 3% Topblock and 0.4% Tween 20 in phosphate-buffered saline for 1 h and then left overnight at 4 °C in the presence of a rabbit polyclonal anti-PDX1 antibody (kindly provided by Dr. H. Edlund, Umea University, Sweden) at a 1:5000 dilution. A goat anti-rabbit IgG antisera conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (1:4000) (Amersham Biosciences) was then added for 60 min, and immunoreactive products were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence (SuperSignal West Pico, Pierce) followed by exposure to X-Omat Kodak films (Eastman Kodak Co.) for less than 1 min. Insulin Secretion Assay and ATP Measurement—Islets were washed in Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate-HEPES buffer (KRBH: 140 mm NaCl, 3.6 mm KCl, 0.5 mm NaH2PO4, 0.5 mm MgSO4, 1.5 mm CaCl2, 2 mm NaHCO3, 10 mm HEPES, 0.1% bovine serum albumin) and incubated at 37 °C for 60 min in the same buffer supplemented with 2.5 mm glucose. Subsequently, insulin secretion from 15 size-matched islets per condition was measured over a period of 30 min in KRBH containing the indicated stimulators. Total insulin content was extracted using acid ethanol. Insulin was detected by radioimmunoassay using rat insulin as standard and an antibody raised against rat insulin (Linco, St. Louis, MO). Secreted insulin was expressed as percentage of total cellular insulin content. Total cellular ATP was measured after 10 min of incubation in 2.5 mm glucose using a bioluminescence assay kit according to the manufacturer's recommendations (HS II, Roche Diagnostics). Alterations in cytosolic ATP levels in response to 16.5 mm glucose or 100 μm IBMX, 1 μm forskolin, 16.5 mm glucose were monitored using the adenoviral construct AdCAGLuc encoding the ATP-sensitive bioluminescence probe luciferase (25Ishihara H. Maechler P. Gjinovci A. Herrera P.L. Wollheim C.B. Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 330-335Google Scholar). Islets were preincubated at 37 °C for 30 min in KRBH before the addition of 2.5 mm glucose and 500 μm beetle luciferin (Promega, Madison, WI). Changes in ATP were then recorded using a FLUOstar Optima apparatus (BMG Lab Technologies) as described previously by Merglen et al. (26Merglen A. Theander S. Rubi B. Chaffard G. Wollheim C.B. Maechler P. Endocrinology. 2004; 145: 667-678Google Scholar). Glucose Oxidation—Carbon dioxide production derived from glucose oxidation was measured using the multiwell 14CO2-capture assay developed by Collins et al. (27Collins C.L. Bode B.P. Souba W.W. Abcouwer S.F. BioTechniques. 1998; 24: 803-808Google Scholar). Radioactive carbon dioxide trapped in filter paper was measured using a Beckman LS6500 Scintillation counter (Beckman Instruments, Nyon, Switzerland), and results were expressed as nanomoles of glucose/mg protein/h. Oligonucleotide Microarray Assay—RNA was extracted from either control/AdCalacZ or AdRIPDN79PDX1-infected islets using the RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen, Basel, Switzerland). Because of difficulties in obtaining sufficient amounts of RNA from single experiments and to decrease eventual biases caused by biological variations, islets from three separate experiments were pooled for total RNA extraction yielding one sample. A total of three controls and three tests were thus generated and used to produce biotinylated cRNAs. Five μg of RNA was converted into double-stranded cDNA using a cDNA synthesis kit (Superscript Choice, Invitrogen) with a special oligo(dT)24 primer containing a T7 RNA promoter site added 3′ to the poly(T) tract. Biotinylated cRNAs were generated from cDNAs using the bioarray high yield RNA transcript labeling kit (Enzo Life Science) and subsequently purified with the RNeasy kit (Qiagen). Eighteen μg of cRNA probe derived from each sample (three AdCaLac and three AdRIPDN79PDX1 islet samples) was fragmented and hybridized to six independent Affymetrix Rat Genome U34A arrays (Affymetrix, High Wycombe, UK) by using an Affymetrix GeneChip Fluidics Station 400 and standard protocols. Although expanded rat arrays are now available (U34B and -C), these only provide ESTs, whereas the U34A array contains probes representing all currently full-length or annotated genes. However, it is important to note that this array may not cover all of the endocrine pancreas transcriptome. Arrays were visualized on a Agilent 2500 GeneArray scanner, and image files were processed using Microarray Analysis Suite version 5.0 (Affymetrix). The software calculates “signal” values and provides “detection” calls, “present,” “marginal,” or “absent,” for each probe set. Detection calls are determined from statistical calculations of the difference in hybridization signals between perfect match oligonucleotides and their corresponding control mismatch sequence (probe set). Only genes/ESTs with a detection call present in both control/AdCaLacZ and AdRIPDN79PDX1-infected islets triplicates were subsequently used for comparison analysis. Genes/ESTs that were selectively present in either control or DN79PDX1-expressing islets were not detected under these experimental conditions. To identify differentially expressed transcripts, pairwise comparison analyses were carried out with Affymetrix MAS 5.0. Each of the experimental samples (number of experiments) was compared with each of the reference samples (number of reference experiments), resulting in (number of experiments × number of reference experiments) pairwise comparisons. This approach, which is based on the Mann-Whitney pairwise comparison test, allows the ranking of results by concordance, as well as the calculation of significance (p value) of each identified change in gene expression (28Hubbell E. Liu W.M. Mei R. Bioinformatics. 2002; 18: 1585-1592Google Scholar, 29Liu W.M. Mei R. Di X. Ryder T.B. Hubbell E. Dee S. Webster T.A. Harrington C.A. Ho M.H. Baid J. Smeekens S.P. Bioinformatics. 2002; 18: 1593-1599Google Scholar). Genes for which the concordance in the pairwise comparisons exceeded a threshold (i.e. 60%) were considered to be statistically significant. This conservative analytical approach was used to limit the number of false-positives. A 77% cut off in consistency of change (at least 7 of 9 comparisons were either increased or decreased) was then applied to identify potential PDX1-regulated genes/ESTs. DN79PDX1-regulated genes were organized and visualized into functional clusters using the GeneSpring software (Silicon Genetics, Redwood City, CA). Real Time RT-PCR—Total RNA was extracted using the Trizol reagent (Invitrogen), and 1 μg was converted into cDNA as described previously (30Gauthier B. Robb M. McPherson R. Atherosclerosis. 1999; 142: 301-307Google Scholar). Primers were designed using the Primer Express software (Applera Europe, Rotkreuz, Switzerland); sequences can be obtained upon request. Real time PCR was performed using an ABI 7000 Sequence Detection System (Applera Europe), and PCR products were quantified fluorometrically using the SYBR Green Core Reagent kit. Three distinct amplifications were performed in duplicate for each transcript, and mean values were normalized to the mean value of the reference mRNA cyclophilin. Statistical Analysis—Results are expressed as mean ± S.E. Where indicated, the statistical significance of the differences between groups was estimated by Student's t test. Adenovirus-mediated DN79PDX1 Gene Transfer—Biochemical and molecular studies on isolated islets derived from transgenic mice bearing a deleted Pdx1 gene have been hampered by limited islet recovery (13Johnson J.D. Ahmed N.T. Luciani D.S. Han Z. Tran H. Fujita J. Misler S. Edlund H. Polonsky K.S. J. Clin. Investig. 2003; 111: 1147-1160Google Scholar). Therefore, we transduced rat islets with a recombinant adenoviral construct encoding a dominant negative variant of PDX1 (DN79PDX1). DN79PDX1, which lacks the transactivation domain but preserves an intact DNA-binding domain, was shown to exert its dominant negative function by competing with endogenous PDX1 for binding to the cognate site in the rat insulin 1 gene promoter (16Wang H. Maechler P. Ritz-Laser B. Hagenfeldt K.A. Ishihara H. Philippe J. Wollheim C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 25279-25286Google Scholar). To ensure functionality of the adenoviral construct, the insulinoma cell line INS-1E (30,000 cells) was infected with 4 and 17 × 106 viral particles of either AdCaLacZ or AdRIPDN79PDX1, and mRNA levels for insulin as well a GLUT2 were quantified by real time RT-PCR. Both PDX1 target gene transcripts were dose-dependently decreased in cells overexpressing DN79PDX1 reaching levels 30% of those found in control cells (Fig. 1A) (16Wang H. Maechler P. Ritz-Laser B. Hagenfeldt K.A. Ishihara H. Philippe J. Wollheim C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 25279-25286Google Scholar). The capacity of similar amounts (4 and 17 × 105 viral particles/islet comprising ∼3000 cells) of AdRIPDN79PDX1 to direct DN79PDX1 expression in islet β-cells was then assessed by Western blot analysis using nuclear extracts isolated from transduced islets. Immunoblotting using PDX1 antiserum revealed a band of 31 kDa in islets infected with AdRIPDN79PDX1 but not with the control adenovirus AdCa-LacZ. This band was identical to that observed in the cell line rαβ-DN-PDX1–59 expressing the corresponding DN79PDX1 in a plasmid construct (Fig. 1B) (16Wang H. Maechler P. Ritz-Laser B. Hagenfeldt K.A. Ishihara H. Philippe J. Wollheim C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 25279-25286Google Scholar). Most interesting, endogenous PDX1 was only detected by using 20 μg of nuclear protein extracts (Fig. 1B). To assess the ability of DN79PDX1 to interact with its cognate DNA-binding element, electromobility shift assays were performed using a radiolabeled rat insulin 1 gene promoter FARFLAT element in the presence of the same nuclear extracts. A single predominant retarded complex was detected with extracts derived from islets transduced with AdRIPDN79PDX1 but not with AdCaLacZ (Fig. 1C). A similar migrating complex was also detected in rαβ-DN-PDX1–59 cell nuclear extracts along with two weaker complexes corresponding to endogenous PDX1 and HNF-1α (31Wang H. Maechler P. Hagenfeldt K.A. Wollheim C.B. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6701-6713Google Scholar). The interaction of DN79PDX1 with the FARFLAT element was confirmed by the supershift of the complex in the presence of a PDX1 antibody (Fig. 1C, lane 5). Taken together, these results suggest that DN79PDX1 is expressed and capable of interacting with a cognate DNA-binding site in islets infected with the adenoviral construct AdRIPDN79PDX1. Secretagogue-evoked Insulin Secretion Is Blunted in DN79PDX1-expressing Rat Islets—Mutations in the PDX1 gene, which are associated with either MODY4 or late onset diabetes, have been linked to impaired insulin secretion in β-cells (10Thomas M.K.

Wright C.V. Powers A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 11225-11232Google Scholar). These findings have been challenged recently in a study (13Johnson J.D. Ahmed N.T. Luciani D.S. Han Z. Tran H. Fujita J. Misler S. Edlund H. Polonsky K.S. J. Clin. Investig. 2003; 111: 1147-1160Google Scholar) demonstrating that β-cell mass rather than β-cell function dictates glycemia in a transgenic animal model of MODY4. To resolve this discrepancy, we investigated the impact of dominant negative suppression of PDX1 on insulin secretory responses to glucose, leucine, and arginine using islets transduced with AdRIPDN79PDX1. These secretagogues were selected for their action at different and specific levels of the signal transduction cascade: glucose at the primary step, leucine at the mitochondria downstream of glycolysis, and arginine at the late depolarization event (32Wollheim C.B. Diabetologia. 2000; 43: 265-277Google Scholar). Islets were maintained in KRBH containing 2.5 mm glucose for 60 min prior to the addition of the indicated stimulators for 30 min (Fig. 2A). 16.5 mm glucose, 20 mm arginine, as well as 20 mm leucine evoked a 5- and 7-fold increase in insulin secretion in noninfected islets and β-galactosidase-expressing islets, respectively (Fig. 2A). Increasing amounts of AdRIPDN79PDX1 resulted in a dose-dependent decrease in both glucose- and leucine-stimulated insulin release (90 and 60% inhibition for glucose and leucine, respectively, at 17 × 105 viral particles/islet). Most interesting, arginine-evoked insulin secretion was unaffected in islets transduced with low amounts of virus, whereas higher concentrations completely blunted the response. Total cellular insulin content was not altered in either AdCaLacZ or AdRIPDN79PDX1-transduced islets suggesting that reduced insulin secretion was not because of decreased proinsulin biosynthesis (data not shown). Most interesting, the secretory response to high glucose in PDX1-deficient islets was restored in the presence of 1 μm forskolin and 100 μm IBMX (Fig. 2B). This suggests that the exocytotic machinery is fully functional. To further assess metabolism-secretion coupling, we estimated the rate of glucose oxidation by measuring the conversion of d-U-14Cto 14CO2 in islets expressing DN79PDX1. Formation of 14CO2 from 15 mm d-[U-14C]glucose was equally efficient in both control and transduced islets (4-fold increase, Fig. 2C). Taken together, these results support the hypothesis that reduction in PDX1 impairs mitochondrial fuel-mediated insulin secretion without altering glucose oxidation. Furthermore, membrane depolarization-induced calcium rises may also be inefficient in causing insulin exocytosis, as indicated by the attenuated effect of arginine. Identification of PDX1 Target Genes in Rat Pancreatic Islets by Microarray Analysis—To gain further insight into the molecular events involved in impaired insulin secretion associated with altered PDX1 expression, we performed oligonucleotide microarray of isolated rat islets transduced with either AdCaLacZ or AdRIPDN79PDX1. Consistent with previous reports (33Cardozo A.K. Heimberg H. Heremans Y. Leeman R. Kutlu B. Kruhoffer M. Orntoft T. Eizirik D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 48879-48886Google Scholar), only 30% of interrogated sequences were expressed in islets. Comparison of expression profiles between AdCaLacZ- and AdRIPDN79PDX1-infected islets revealed up-regulation by more than 1.6-fold of 70 genes or ESTs, whereas 56 were down-regulated by more than 1.8-fold (Table I). A detailed description of genes classified according to function along with their average fold change calculated from the triplicate analysis are also listed in Table II. It is noteworthy that, similar to INS-1 cells, GLUT2 mRNA levels were suppressed in islets expressing DN79PDX1. In contrast, the insulin transcript was unchanged (data not shown). Expression of 24 genes encoding metabolic enzymes was altered corroborating the hypothesis that metabolism-secretion coupling is impaired by PDX1 suppression. We therefore chose to investigate further the regulation and cellular impact of transcripts within this functional cluster.Table IFunctional clustering of genes that were differentially regulated in DN79PDX1 overexpressing islets as compared with control isletsClusterNo. genes represented on microarrayNo. genes regulatedUpDownReceptors156523Transporters80112Metabolism789222Signal transduction74941Nuclear or DNA-binding proteins365313Growth control and apoptosis34154Cell adhesion and extracellular matrix18431Membrane and granule-associated proteins8623Antioxidants and NO production4541Chemokines and cytokines3817Cytoarchitecture3416Miscellaneous3903ESTs37652210Total88017056 Open table in a new tab Table IIClassified list of known genes identified by Affymetrix microarray analysis as differentially expressed in DN79PDX1-infected islets versus control isletsCluster"

We have examined the role of HSF1 in the malignant phenotype of PC-3 prostate carcinoma cells. We have developed a dominant negative construct of HSF1 that antagonizes transcription from HSP promoters and results in the depletion of intracellular HSP 70. Our studies indicate that expression of DN-HSF1 dramatically alters the DNA content of PC-3 cells (derived from p53 null prostatic carcinoma) and inhibits aneuploidy in these cells. This effect is due to prolonged expression of DN-HSF1, and transient expression of the dominant negative factor from an inducible promoter failed to cause the effect. Inhibition of aneuploidy in p53 null PC-3 cells by DN-HSF1 expression was recapitulated by expression within the cells of wild type p53. Furthermore, cells expressing DN-HSF1 showed a profound inhibition in the development of aneuploidy when exposed to chemical agents that disrupt the mitotic spindle and prevent progression through metaphase. Inhibition of aneuploidy in PC-3 cells expressing DN-HSF1 was associated with delayed breakdown of cyclin B1 compared with controls, consistent with a role for wild type HSF1 in the regulation of cyclin B1 degradation, a key step in the control of mitosis. Our experiments therefore demonstrate that HSF1 plays a functional role in cancer cells under nonstress conditions and influences cell cycle behavior and progression through mitosis and promotes the development of the aneuploid state.

Exposure of cells to elevated temperatures leads to expression of the heat shock response, which involves the induction of a cohort of heat shock proteins (HSPs) 1The abbreviations used are: HSP, heat shock protein; HSF1, heat shock factor 1; HSE, heat shock element(s); DN, dominant negative; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay; wtHSF1, wild type HSF1. by stress and is accompanied by the expression of heat resistance (1Georgopolis C. Welch W.J. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1993; 9: 601-634Google Scholar, 2Lindquist S. Craig E.A. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1988; 22: 631-637Google Scholar). HSPs accumulate to high levels in stressed cells and remain elevated for a prolonged period (1Georgopolis C. Welch W.J. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1993; 9: 601-634Google Scholar, 2Lindquist S. Craig E.A. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1988; 22: 631-637Google Scholar). Accumulation of HSPs is due to activation of HSP gene expression at the levels of transcription, mRNA stability, translation, and protein stability (1Georgopolis C. Welch W.J. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1993; 9: 601-634Google Scholar, 2Lindquist S. Craig E.A. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1988; 22: 631-637Google Scholar, 3Wu C. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1995; 11: 441-469Google Scholar). In mammalian cells, heat shock genes are transcriptionally regulated by heat shock factor-1 (HSF1), a sequence-specific transcription factor that binds to the heat shock elements (HSE) in their promoters (3Wu C. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1995; 11: 441-469Google Scholar, 4Sorger P.K. Pelham H.R.B. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 3035-3041Google Scholar, 5Voellmy R. Crit. Rev. Eukaryotic Gene Expr. 1994; 4: 357-401Google Scholar). The mechanisms involved in HSF1 activation are post-translational and involve the conversion of HSF1 from a latent cytoplasmic form to an active nuclear protein (6Rabindran S.K. Haroun R.I. Clos J. Wisniewski J. Wu C. Science. 1993; 259: 230-234Google Scholar, 7Sarge K.D. Murphy S.P. Morimoto R.I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 1392-1407Google Scholar, 8Westwood T. Wu C. Mol. Cell.

Science. 1993; 259: 230-234Google Scholar, 7Sarge K.D. Murphy S.P. Morimoto R.I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 1392-1407Google Scholar, 8Westwood T. Wu C. Mol. Cell.

Trimerization is governed by arrays of amphipathic α-helical residues in the amino-terminal domain of HSF family proteins that interact to form coiled coils, and trimerization is negatively regulated under nonstress conditions by a fourth region of amphipathic α-helix in the carboxyl-terminal domain (6Rabindran S.K. Haroun R.I. Clos J. Wisniewski J. Wu C. Science. 1993; 259: 230-234Google Scholar, 7Sarge K.D. Murphy S.P. Morimoto R.I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 1392-1407Google Scholar, 8Westwood T. Wu C. Mol.

Biol. 1994; 14: 7557-7568Google Scholar). Most evidence indicates a model for HSF1 regulation in which the protein exists as a monomer in the cytoplasm associated with molecular chaperones that act as repressors of activation (3Wu C. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1995; 11: 441-469Google Scholar, 10Zuo J. Baler R. Dahl G. Voellmy R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 7557-7568Google Scholar, 12Zuo J. Rungger D. Voellmy R. Mol. Cell.

Recent studies suggest that the heat shock response becomes deregulated in cancer and that HSPs become expressed to a high level and play a role in carcinogenesis (14Hoang A.T. Huang J. Rudra-Ganguly N. Zheng J. Powell W.C. Rabindran S.K. Wu C. Roy-Burman P. Am. J. Pathol. 2000; 156: 857-864Google Scholar) HSP70 overexpression for instance leads to malignant transformation in fibroblasts, and this may be related to the antiapoptotic effects of HSP70 (15Volloch V.Z. Sherman M.Y. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 3648-3651Google Scholar); transformation was ascribed to a switch in the apoptotic index, with HSP70 overexpression favoring cell survival and the balance between cell birth and death being altered (15Volloch V.Z. Sherman M.Y. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 3648-3651Google Scholar). Our studies show that the expression of HSP70 antisense RNA in PC-3 prostate carcinoma cells leads to spontaneous apoptosis. 2E. Jones, M. A. Stevenson, and S. K. Calderwood, manuscript in preparation. In addition, many tumor types contain high concentrations of HSP of the HSP27, HSP70, and HSP90 families (16Ciocca D.R. Clark G.M.

Cancer Lett. 1999; 137: 45-51Google Scholar). There is a molecular link between HSP expression and tumor progression in prostate cancer in that HSP56, -70, and -90 regulate the function of the androgen receptor (22Froesch B.A. Takayama S. Reed J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11660-11666Google Scholar, 23Grossmann M.E. Huang H. Tindall D.J. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 2001; 93: 1687-1697Google Scholar). Escape from androgen receptor dependence during tumorigenesis may involve altered HSP-androgen receptor interactions (23Grossmann M.E. Huang H. Tindall D.J. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 2001; 93: 1687-1697Google Scholar). The role of HSP in tumor development may also be related to their function in the development of tolerance to stress (24Li G.C. Hahn G.M. Cancer Res. 1981; 40: 4501-4508Google Scholar). We have therefore examined the potential role of HSF1 in the malignant phenotype of PC-3 prostate carcinoma cells using a dominant negative hsf1 construct (DN-HSF1) that antagonizes the transcription from heat shock promoters and depletes intracellular HSP concentrations. We show that expression of DN-HSF1 dramatically alters DNA content in PC-3 cell populations and inhibits aneuploidy. Our experiments suggest that HSF1 is active in malignant cells under nonstress conditions and influences cell cycle behavior and ploidy regulation. Cell Culture, Synchrony, and Measurement of Cell Cycle Parameters—PC-3 cells from the American Type Tissue Culture Collection were maintained in F-12 medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum in a 5% CO2/air atmosphere. Cells were arrested in G0 by serum deprivation. Cultures were washed once in 0.5% fetal calf serum in F-12 medium and maintained in this medium for 72 h before release from the block with 10% fetal calf serum To monitor cell cycle progression after release from serum starvation, thymidine block, or nocodazole block, cultures were pulsed with 0.5 μCi of [3H]thymidine for 4-h intervals and washed three times in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4, and acid soluble radioactivity was extracted with 5% trichloroacetic acid for 20 min at 4 °C. Cultures were washed twice in ethanol solubilized in 0.1 m NaOH, 2% Na2CO3, and radioactivity in the acid-insoluble pool was determined. Arrest in and progression from mitosis was monitored by measuring the mitotic index during nocodazole treatment and release from the block. To examine the effect of spindle disruption on cell cycle parameters, cells were treated with 0.1 mg/ml colchicines for a duration of one-half up to 4 PDL times. Cells were then washed twice with PBS and fixed/permeabilized with methanol at -20 °C for 15 min. Cells were then incubated with 25 mg/ml propidium iodide and 0.01% RNase A for 20 min in dark at room temperature. Cell cycle distribution in the stained cells was assayed using a Becton Dickinson FACScan flow cytometer (Mountain View, CA). Expression Vectors and Reporter Constructs—The human HSP70B promoter construct p2500CAT and anti-HSP72 antibodies were purchased from StressGen (Victoria, Canada). DOTAP was from Roche Applied Science. pGL.Basic3 and pSV-β-galactosidase plasmids, Genelight luciferase, and β-galactosidase assay reagents were from Promega (Madison, WI); restriction and modifying enzymes were from New England Bio-Labs (Beverley, MA); and sequencing reagents, Hybond-N membrane, and Rediprime kit were from Amersham Biosciences. Oligonucleotides for electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) were synthesized by Bio-synthesis (Coralville, IA). pGL reporter construct pGL.HSP70B was constructed by inserting the HSP70B gene promoter fragment from the BglII site to the HindIII site (1.44 kb) of p2500-CAT into pGL.Basic 3 at the corresponding sites. Human HSF1 cDNA (20Strik H.M. Weller M. Frank B. Hermisson M. Deininger M.H. Dichgans J. Meyermann R. Anticancer Res. 2000; 20: 4457-4462Google Scholar) was inserted into the pcDNA3.1 (-) expression vector at the XhoI and EcoRI sites termed as pHSF1 (+ or - indicate the orientation of the polycloning site in pcDNA3.1). pHSF1mut was derived from p-B-HSF1 by digesting HSF1 with the PfIMI, blunting with Klenow, and religating. A leucine residue was thus inserted into HSF1 at position 22 to mutate the N-terminal DNA binding domain. p-B-control plasmid (vector control) was derived from p-B-HSF1 by deleting HSF1 at the XhoI and EcoRI sites. After blunting with Klenow, the resulting fragment was religated. Constructs were confirmed by sequencing with a T7 kit (Amersham Biosciences). Double-stranded DNA templates were prepared from minipreps as described (21Yano M. Naito Z. Yokoyama M. Shiraki Y. Ishiwata T. Inokuchi M. Asano G. Cancer Lett. 1999; 137: 45-51Google Scholar). The C-terminal truncation mutant DN-HSF1 was generated by the polymerase chain reaction using plasmids designed to give rise to a fragment containing codons 1-379 from HSF1. DN-HSF1 was then inserted into pcDNA3.1 as described above. Conditionally inducible expression of wild type and dominant negative HSF1 was achieved using the regulated ecdysone-inducible system (Invitrogen). The HSF1 constructs were cloned into the pIND/V5-His ecdysone-inducible expression vector. Prior to transfection with these vectors, PC-3 cells were transfected with the pVgRXR vector, which constitutively expresses the ecdysone receptor and selected for incorporation of plasmid with the antibiotic zeomycin. pIND/V5-His.HSF1 and pIND/V5-His.DN-HSF1 were then transfected into the pVgRXR-expressing cells, and double selection was carried out using G418 and zeomycin to select for cells containing both plasmids. Proteins expressed from the vector contain a C-terminal V-5 His tag and can be detected with commercial anti-V5 antibodies. The ecdysone promoter in the pIND vector was induced using ponasterone A (Invitrogen), an analog of the insect steroid hormone ecdysone. Transient Transfection, Luciferase Assay, and Bradford Protein Assay—Transient transfection was carried out using liposomal transfection reagent DOTAP (Roche Applied Science). Cells were seeded in 6-well tissue culture plates at 2-5 × 105/well the previous day and transfected according to the instructions. 18-24 h after transfection, cells were harvested and assayed for luciferase activity using reagents supplied by Promega. Promoter activities were normalized to total cell protein assayed using a Bradford microprotein assay (Bio-Rad). All results were shown to be consistent in at least three separate experiments. Stable Transfection—Following transfection, PC-3 cells were maintained in Ham's F-12 medium containing 10% fetal calf serum for 24 h. Neomycin (G418) was added to a concentration of 300 ng/ml until surviving cells reached confluence. Surviving clones were then selected and amplified. EMSA—Preparation of whole cell extracts and assay of HSF binding to a consensus HSE from the human HSP70B promoter were assayed by EMSA as described (25Price B.D. Calderwood S.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 3365-3368Google Scholar, 26Schiller P. Amin J. Ananthan J. Brown M.E. Scott W.A. Voellmy R. J. Mol. Biol. 1988; 203: 97-105Google Scholar). For some experiments, HSF1 was extracted from isolated nuclei prior to EMSA (25Price B.D. Calderwood S.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 3365-3368Google Scholar, 27Lee K.A. Green M.R. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 181: 227Google Scholar). The specificity of binding and the nature of the proteins in the HSF-HSE complexes were analyzed by competition with unlabeled oligonucleotides and supershift assay with specific anti-HSF1 and HSF-2 antibodies (28Bruce J.L. Chen C. Xie Y. Zhong R. Wang Y. Stevenson M.A. Calderwood S.K. Cell Stress Chaperones. 1999; 4: 36-45Google Scholar, 29Cahill C.M. Waterman W.R. Auron P.E. Calderwood S.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24874-24879Google Scholar). For supershift assay, antibodies were incubated in the binding reaction at a dilution of 1:100, and the incubations were carried out as above. For peptide competition experiments, we used a 500 μm concentration of the HSF1 or HSF-2 epitope peptides. Immunoblot Assay—Cells were washed and dissolved in Laemmli sample buffer, and samples were fractionated by 10% SDS-PAGE prior to immunoblot assay with anti-HSF1 antibodies using similar procedures to those described previously (30Stevenson M.A. Calderwood S.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 1234-1238Google Scholar). The specificity of Ab-68-3 directed against HSF1 was assayed and was described previously (28Bruce J.L. Chen C. Xie Y. Zhong R. Wang Y. Stevenson M.A. Calderwood S.K. Cell Stress Chaperones. 1999; 4: 36-45Google Scholar). Generation of Dominant Negative HSF1: C-terminal Truncation Mutants of HSF1 Repress Activation of the HSP70B Promoter by HSF1 and Prevent HSP72 Expression during Heat Shock—We first attempted to generate HSF1 constructs that would act as specific inhibitors of HSP transcription when overexpressed in cells. Two molecular strategies were employed to design such negatively acting constructs. The first strategy included the use of HSF1 containing a point mutation (HSF1-L22) that we have shown to prevent its binding to HSE in target promoters (31Chen C. Xie Y. Stevenson M.A. Auron P.E. Calderwood S.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26803-26806Google Scholar); the rationale behind this approach was that such a mutant would form trimetric complexes with wild type HSF1 (wtHSF1) and thus reduce the affinity of HSF1 for HSE elements in target promoters. High affinity HSF1-HSE binding requires contact between each member of the activated HSF1 trimer and the triple inverted nGAAn repeat that comprises the canonical HSE (3Wu C. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1995; 11: 441-469Google Scholar). The second strategy employed the use of an HSF1 construct HSF1 1-379 with a 3′ truncation of 150 codons, removing the N-terminal trans-activation domains and leaving DNA binding and trimerization domains (12Zuo J. Rungger D. Voellmy R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4319-4330Google Scholar, 32Green M.T. Schuetz T.J. Sullivan E.K. Kingston R.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3354-3362Google Scholar, 33Newton E.M. Knauf U. Green M. Kingston R.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 839-846Google Scholar). This approach has the added advantage of producing an HSF1 constitutively competent to form intracellular trimers due to the deletion of the inhibitory C-terminal leucine zipper 4 (8Westwood T. Wu C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 3481-3486Google Scholar). Constructs were first tested for their ability to competitively inhibit the activity of wild type HSF1 (wtHSF1) in inducing the strictly heat shock-inducible promoter from the HSP70B gene (26Schiller P. Amin J. Ananthan J. Brown M.E. Scott W.A. Voellmy R. J. Mol. Biol. 1988; 203: 97-105Google Scholar). The experiments involved intracellular activation of a transfected promoter-reporter construct based on the HSP70B promoter (pGL.HSP70B) by overexpression of wtHSF1. Our previous experiments have shown that the HSP70B promoter is activated by HSF1 overexpression (34Chu B. Soncin F. Price B.D. Stevenson M.A. Calderwood S.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30847-30857Google Scholar, 35Wang X. Grammatikakis N. Siganou A. Calderwood S.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 6013-6026Google Scholar). wtHSF1 was co-transfected with pGL.HSP70B, and the potential inhibitory HSF1 constructs were examined at a range of plasmid concentrations. The first strategy using pHSF1 (L22) proved ineffective, and the HSF1 point mutant, although defective in HSE binding, did not inhibit wtHSF1 from activating the HSP70B promoter even when transfected at 50 times excess over the wtHSF1 in co-transfection experiments (data not shown). The second strategy was highly effective and led to a construct (HSF1 1-379) that antagonized wtHSF1 in a dose-dependent manner, causing significant repression even at a mutant/wild type plasmid ratio of 1:1 (Fig. 1A). As predicted, part of the effectiveness of this construct may be due to enhanced ability to bind to HSP promoters. The EMSA experiment in Fig. 1B shows that HSF1 1-379 in nuclear extracts from HSF1 1-379 transfected cells binds HSE effectively, whereas transfected wtHSF1 or pHSF1 (L22) was less effective. The identity of the HSE binding band is indicated by the fact that the construct was not supershifted by anti-HSF1 Ab68-3 antibody, which recognizes the C terminus of HSF1 (28Bruce J.L. Chen C. Xie Y. Zhong R. Wang Y. Stevenson M.A. Calderwood S.K. Cell Stress Chaperones. 1999; 4: 36-45Google Scholar). This antibody is able to shift HSF1-HSE complexes using nuclear extracts from heat-shocked cells, as shown previously (29Cahill C.M. Waterman W.R. Auron P.E. Calderwood S.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24874-24879Google Scholar). As our previous studies also showed (36Xie Y. Zhong R. Chen C. Calderwood S.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 4687-4698Google Scholar), HSF1 1-379 migrates in the native gels at a similar rate compared with wtHSF1 (Fig. 1B). We next examined the intracellular expression, at the protein level, of a strongly heat-inducible member of the HSP family, HSP72, in cells stably expressing either wtHSF1 or HSF1 1-379. The immunoblot experiments in Fig. 1C show that the HSP72 protein is expressed at 37 °C, that HSP72 levels are increased when wtHSF1 is overexpressed, and that HSP72 expression is reduced when dominant negative construct HSF1 1-379 is expressed. Heat shock led to a marked increase in HSP72 concentrations in PC-3 cells, and this increase was effectively inhibited by HSF1 1-379 overexpression (Fig. 1C). Fig. 1D shows the relative levels of HSF1 and HSF1 1-379 protein in cells stably expressing either wtHSF1 or the dominant negative construct. We therefore utilized the HSF1 1-379 construct in subsequent experiments (DN-HSF1) as a specific inhibitor of HSF1 function to study the role of HSF1 in the malignant phenotype of prostate carcinoma cells. Extracts were also probed for relative levels of β-actin to show similar loading (Fig. 1E). Cell Cycle Distribution in PC-3 Cells Stably Expressing either wtHSF1 or DN-HSF1—Since HSF1 and relative HSP expression have been shown to affect cell cycle distribution (28Bruce J.L. Chen C. Xie Y. Zhong R. Wang Y. Stevenson M.A. Calderwood S.K. Cell Stress Chaperones. 1999; 4: 36-45Google Scholar) and the rate of apoptosis (37Gabai V.L. Meriin A.B. Yaglom J.A. Volloch V.Z. Sherman M.Y. FEBS Lett. 1998; 438: 1-4Google Scholar), we next examined cell cycle distribution in populations of cells stably transfected with either empty vector alone, pHSF1 or the pHSF1 1-379 construct (Fig. 2 and Table I). Each of the transfected cell types grew in continuous culture, although the cells expressing wtHSF1 grew markedly more slowly than wild type cells in the earlier passages after selection (data not shown). Subsequent analysis of the rate of growth of wild type PC-3, vector alone cell lines, wtHSF1, or DN-HSF1 indicated essentially similar rates of growth in each of the cell types (data not shown). Analysis of populations of wild type (data not shown) and empty vector transfectants by flow cytometric analysis of DNA content indicated that PC-3 cells are near triploid (Fig. 2). Expression of wtHSF1 caused a relative increase in the aneuploid fraction, whereas expression of DN-HSF1 led to a marked diminishment in aneuploidy (Fig. 2). These experiments therefore suggest that the specific inhibition of HSF1 activity in PC-3 cells either leads directly to reversal of the aneuploid DNA distribution that occurs spontaneously in these cells or that HSF1 favors the gradual formation of aneuploidy. In order to determine whether the effects of HSF1 were due to acute effects of the overexpressed proteins on the PC-3 phenotype, we next examined cell lines stably transfected with inducible vectors that express either HSF1 or DN-HSF1 from the Drosophila ecdysone promoter.Table ICells in M1, M2, and M3 inFig. 1ConditionM1M2M3%%%Vector43.6 ± 3.429.1 ± 3.118.2 ± 2.5pHSF127 ± 2.547 ± 4.125 ± 1.7pDN-HSF167 ± 5.922 ± 1.8 Open table in a new tab Cell Cycle Distribution in PC-3 Cells Acutely Expressing either wtHSF1 or HSF1 1-379 from an Inducible Expression Vector—Fig. 3A and Table II show the relative distributions in DNA content of PC-3 cell populations derived from cells stably co-expressing the ecdysone receptor and either DN-HSF1 or wtHSF1 from the ecdysone regulated promoter. As can be seen, identical aneuploid PC-3 populations were observed in cells induced for 24 h with the ecdysone receptor agonist ponasterone, suggesting that the effects of the HSF1 constructs on the PC-3 cell populations are more likely due to long term DNHSF1 expression rather than such acute effects of protein expression as the killing of selected cell subpopulations or the acute regulation of cellular DNA content. Fig. 3B shows that despite the lack of effect of the inducer on cell ploidy, both HSF1 and DN-HSF1 1-379 are expressed in the cell populations induced with ponasterone.Table IICells in M1, M2, and M3 inFig. 3ConditionM1M2M3%%%pDN-HSF122.8 ± 2.641 ± 3.921 ± 2.3pDN-HSF1 + ponasterone26 ± 4.840 ± 5.219 ± 2.4pHSF124 ± 3.741 ± 5.319 ± 2.6pHSF1 + ponasterone20 ± 3.236 ± 4.728 ± 3.1 Open table in a new tab Stable Transfection with either DN-HSF1 or Wild Type p53 Leads to a Reduction in DNA Content in PC-3 Cell Populations—Since previous studies show that inactivation or mutation of the p53 tumor antigen can lead to the induction of aneuploidy, we examined whether stable overexpression of p53 in the p53 null PC-3 cells (Fig. 4B and Table III) would lead to the reduction of aneuploidy. This turned out to be the case in our experiments, and both p53 and DN-HSF1 expression produced PC-3 cell lines in which the occurrence of aneuploid cells was markedly reduced (Fig. 4A).Table IIICells in M1, M2, and M3 inFig. 4ConditionM1M2M3%%%Vector52 ± 6.138 ± 4.110 ± 3.1pDN-HSF180 ± 7.420 ± 4.0p-p5389 ± 6.111 ± 2.5 Open table in a new tab Overexpression of DN-HSF1 Inhibits the Generation of Aneuploidy in Cells Exposed to Colcemid—The deregulation of ploidy in malignant cells is associated with a defect in mitotic checkpoints (38Hartwell L.H.

These include the spindle assembly checkpoint and the G1 tetraploidy checkpoint, the cell cycle regulatory mechanism in which DNA replication is linked to the completion of the prior mitosis (39Lanni J.S.

Res. 2003; 532: 245-253Google Scholar). The G1 tetraploidy checkpoint appears to require the expression of wild type p53, and aneuploidy is associated with loss of functional p53 and the uncoupling of DNA replication from the completion of mitosis (41Notterman D.

The spindle assembly checkpoint does not require p53 (42Andreassen P.R. Lohez O.D. Margolis R.L. Mutat. Res. 2003; 532: 245-253Google Scholar). PC-3 cells are null for p53 expression (45Carroll P.E.

In fact, as shown above, stable transfection of these cells with a vector that leads to the constitutive expression of wild type p53 (wtp53) protein leads to a reduction in aneuploidy (Fig. 4). The properties of DN-HSF1 thus resemble those of wild type p53 in ability to prevent the formation of aneuploid cell population in the PC-3 cell line, apparently by the activation of mitotic checkpoints. Therefore, we next examined the effect of microtubule active agents that block spindle assembly/progression through mitosis on cell cycle distribution in the PC-3 cell lines. Cells were synchronized in G0 by serum deprivation, and the cohort of synchronized cells was then released by 10% serum addition in the presence of colcemid for one-half, 1, 2, and 4 population-doubling times (Fig. 5A and Tables IV and V). In the vector control cells, exposure to colcemid led to the formation of cell populations with increasing concentrations of"

Members of these large families of enzymes all experience acylation by their respective substrates at an active site serine as the first step in their catalytic activities. A Ser-X-X-Lys sequence motif is seen in all these proteins, and crystal structures demonstrate that the side-chain functions of the serine and lysine are in contact with one another. Three independent methods were used in this report to address the question of the protonation state of this important lysine (Lys-73) in the TEM-1 β-lactamase from Escherichia coli. These techniques included perturbation of the pKa of Lys-73 by the study of the γ-thialysine-73 variant and the attendant kinetic analyses, investigation of the protonation state by titration of specifically labeled proteins by nuclear magnetic resonance, and by computational treatment using the thermodynamic integration method. All three methods indicated that the pKa of Lys-73 of this enzyme is attenuated to 8.0–8.5. It is argued herein that the unique ground-state ion pair of Glu-166 and Lys-73 of class A β-lactamases has actually raised the pKa of the active site lysine to 8.0–8.5 from that of the parental penicillin-binding protein. Whereas we cannot rule out that Glu-166 might activate the active site water, which in turn promotes Ser-70 for the acylation event, such as proposed earlier, we would like to propose as a plausible alternative for the acylation step the possibility that the ion pair would reconfigure to the protonated Glu-166 and unprotonated Lys-73. As such, unprotonated Lys-73 could promote serine for acylation, a process that should be shared among all active-site serine β-lactamases and penicillin-binding proteins. β-Lactamases and penicillin-binding proteins are bacterial enzymes involved in antibiotic resistance to β-lactam antibiotics and biosynthetic assembly of cell wall, respectively.

As such, unprotonated Lys-73 could promote serine for acylation, a process that should be shared among all active-site serine β-lactamases and penicillin-binding proteins. A number of enzymes have evolved a catalytic strategy that depends on a transient acylation of an active site serine. The catalytic serine residue in these enzymes is followed by a lysine three residues toward the carboxyl termini of the proteins (i.e.... Ser-X-X-Lys...). This sequence motif is seen in serine-dependent β-lactamases and penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs 1The abbreviations used are: PBP, penicillin-binding protein; BEA, (2-bromoethyl)amine; AMPSO, 3-[(1,1-dimethyl-2-hydroxyethyl)-amino]-2-hydroxypropanesulfonic acid; HSQC, heteronuclear single quantum coherence; PME, particle mesh Ewald method. ), of which several hundred members are known. The catalytic implication of this Ser-X-X-Lys sequence motif for β-lactamases is debated in the literature, but the role of these residues in catalysis is likely to be general for the large group of proteins that share this sequence. β-Lactamases are bacterial resistance enzymes to β-lactam antibiotics, which include penicillins and cephalosporins. Members of the class A β-lactamases are the most common among pathogenic bacteria. These enzymes undergo acylation and deacylation at Ser-70 during substrate turnover (1Kotra L.P. Samama J.P.

The process of deacylation of the acyl-enzyme intermediate is best understood. Glu-166 is the active-site general base that promotes a water molecule in the deacylation step (3Herzberg O. Moult J. Science. 1987; 236: 694-701Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar, 4Strynadka N.C.J. Adachi H. Jensen S.E. Johns K. Sielecki A. Betzel C. Sutoh K. James M.N.G.

The contention stems largely from a lack of clear knowledge of the titration states of the active-site residues involved in catalysis. The active-site moieties that could undergo titration are Glu-166, Lys-73, and Lys-234. Two groups have suggested that Lys-73 is not protonated and can serve as the general base in activation of Ser-70 during its acylation (4Strynadka N.C.J. Adachi H. Jensen S.E. Johns K. Sielecki A.

We present herein experimental evidence that indicates that the active site lysine in the class A TEM-1 β-lactamase from Escherichia coli has a lower pKa than a typical lysine. The pKa of Lys-73 was also determined computationally using the molecular dynamics-based thermodynamic integration method. The results were in good agreement with experiments. Further calculations were carried out on the E166A mutant to determine the influence of Glu-166 on the pKa of Lys-73. It was found that the pKa of Lys-73 in the E166A mutant was reduced to 6.0, arguing that the proximity of Glu-166 to Lys-73 has raised its pKa to 8.0–8.5 in class A β-lactamases. These data collectively do not rule out Glu-166 as the potential base that activates an active site water, which in turn would activate the active site serine for acylation. However, based on the reduced pKa for Lys-73 (unique among the 11 lysines), we propose as a plausible alternative mechanism the possibility of a protonated Glu-166 and an unprotonated Lys-73. In this mechanistic scenario, the unprotonated Lys-73 would promote the active site serine for acylation by the substrate. This notion unifies the mechanism(s) for serine acylation by substrates for all active-site serine β-lactamases and PBPs. Materials—Penicillin G was purchased from Sigma. Mezlocillin was the generous gift of Dr. Robert Bonomo. The growth medium was purchased either from Difco Laboratories (Detroit, MI) or Fisher Scientific. The chromatography media were from Bio-Rad Laboratories. Isolation and purification of all enzymes (wild-type and mutants) were carried out as described earlier (15Vakulenko S. Golemi D. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2002; 46: 646-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The 99% 15NH4Cl was purchased from Isotec Inc., and [6-13C]l-lysine (99%) was from Cambridge Isotope Laboratories. Generation of the Mutant TEM-1 β-Lactamases—Mutagenesis of Lys-73 of the TEM-1 β-lactamase to Ala was accomplished by using a QuikChange® site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene), in accordance with the manufacturer's recommendations. The TEM-1 β-lactamase gene that was previously subcloned into an expression vector pET24a(+) was mutated using two primers: forward, 5′-CAATGCTGCGCACTTTTGCAGTTCTGCTATGTGGC-3′, and reverse, 5′-GCCACATAGCAGAACTGCAAAAGTGCTCATCATTG-3′ (the codon for alanine is underlined). Mutated DNA was used to transform E. coli JM83 and selection of transformants was performed on agar supplemented with kanamycin A (30 μg/ml). DNA from several transformants were initially screened by digestion with the restriction endonuclease DraI (this site was removed by mutation). Subsequently the nucleotide sequence of the entire gene was verified. The double mutant C77S/C123A and the triple mutant K73C/C77S/C123A of the TEM β-lactamase were generated using the pTZ19-4 vector essentially as described earlier (16Vakulenko S.B. Geryk B. Kotra L.P. Mobashery S. Lerner S.A. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1998; 42: 1542-1548Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). First, C123A substitution was generated, utilizing primer TEM123 (5′-GGTTATGGCAGCACTGGCTAATTCTCTTACTG-3′; mutated codon underlined). Subsequently, C77S substitution was introduced using primer TEM77 (5′-AATACCGCGCCAGATAGCAGAACTTTAAAAG-3′; mutated codon underlined) to produce the double mutant enzyme. Finally, Lys-73 was mutated to cysteine with primer TEM73 (5′-CGCCAGATAGCAGAACACAAAAAGTGCTCATC-3′; mutated codon underlined). Both DNA strands of the mutant genes were sequenced. Cloning of Mutant TEM β-Lactamase Genes into Expression Vector and Purification of Enzymes—To facilitate β-lactamase secretion into the growth medium, we fused the PCR-generated genes for the C77S/C123A and K73C/C77S/C123A mutant β-lactamases with the leader sequence of the OmpA protein in the pSV106 vector, as described earlier (15Vakulenko S. Golemi D. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2002; 46: 646-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). After resequencing of the entire genes, they were recloned into the NdeI-HindIII sites of the pET24 expression vector. Growth conditions for protein induction and purification were essentially the same as described recently (15Vakulenko S. Golemi D. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2002; 46: 646-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Labeling (15N and 13C) of Enzymes and Protein Preparation—To prepare the proteins uniformly labeled with 15N, we utilized E. coli BL21DE3 and E. coli BL21DE3 pLysS strains, carrying vector pET24a(+) with the TEM-1 β-lactamase and the K73A mutant β-lactamase genes, respectively. Strains were incubated at 37 °C in a minimal medium containing 15NH4Cl as the sole nitrogen source (17Ramesh V. Frederick R.O. Syed S.E.H. Gibson C.F. Yang J.C. Roberts G.C.K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 225: 601-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), 400 mm d-sorbitol, 2.5 mm betaine, and 20 μg/ml kanamycin A. When the optical density at 600 nm for bacterial growth (A600) reached 0.3, expression of proteins was induced by the addition of isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (0.4 mm final concentration), and bacteria were grown for another 20 h at room temperature. The proteins were isolated both from the growth medium and from the periplasm by osmotic shock. For production of proteins selectively labeled with 13C(ϵ)-lysine, each strain was incubated at 37 °C in minimal medium containing 100 μg/ml of each amino acid (excluding lysine), 150 μg/ml 13C-labeled lysine (18Yamazaki T. Yoshida M. Kanaya S. Nakamura H. Nagayama K. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 6036-6047Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 19Roth S.M. Schneider D.M. Strobel L.A. Van Berkum M.F.A. Means A.R. Wand A.J. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 1443-1451Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), 400 mm d-sorbitol, 2.5 mm betaine, and 20 μg/ml kanamycin A to A600 of 0.3. An additional portion of 13C-labeled lysine (150 μg/ml) was added just before induction. Induction and isolation of the selectively labeled proteins was performed essentially as described above. The desired proteins were purified from the growth medium to homogeneity in one step by DEAE-Sepharose ion-exchange chromatography (2.5 × 20 cm) using a linear gradient of 10–100 mm Tris (1.0 liter), pH 7.0. Modification of the K73C/C77S/C123A Mutant Protein—A total of 5 mg of the triple mutant protein was denatured in 8 m urea, 200 mm AMPSO, 15 mm EDTA, pH 8.5, in a final volume of 1.0 ml. The exposure of cysteine to solution was assessed by its titration (10-μl aliquot of the denaturation mixture) with 5,5′-dithiobis-2-nitrobenzoic acid, per the method of Ellman (20Ellman G.L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1959; 82: 70-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (21624) Google Scholar). The mixture was kept at 25 °C with gentle mixing under an atmosphere of argon for 15 min. Upon full denaturation, the protein was incubated with a freshly prepared solution of 2-bromoethylamine in the denaturing buffer that provided a final concentration of 40 mm. The mixture was then gently mixed for 20 h at 25 °C, at which point the cysteine was fully modified. Refolding of the enzyme was carried out according to a modified literature method (21Laminet A.A. Pluckthun A. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 1469-1477Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). The enzyme was diluted into 100 mm sodium phosphate, 600 mm ammonium sulfate, 20% glycerol, pH 7.0 (refolding buffer; total volume of 50 ml) and was kept gently mixing for 1 h at 4 °C. It was necessary to maintain a protein concentration of ≤0.1 mg/ml after the dilution. Removal of urea and ammonium sulfate was accomplished by extensive stepwise dialysis against 100 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, containing 20% glycerol and ammonium sulfate (0.3 m, 0.1 m, and 0 m, in three steps). The protein was concentrated to a maximum of 0.3 mg/ml. In excess of this concentration the protein precipitated. The pH Dependence of Catalysis by the TEM-1 β-Lactamase and of Its Modified K73C/C77S/C123A Mutant Variant—Mezlocillin was used as the substrate for these experiments. Buffers for the pH range of 5.0 to 9.5 were 50 mm sodium acetate (pH 5–6), sodium phosphate (pH 6–7.5), and Tris (pH 8–9), supplemented with 150 mm sodium chloride to keep the ionic strength constant. Analyses of the data were carried out according to the methods of Lineweaver-Burk and Hanes-Wolf. The pH dependence of kcat and kcat/Km were fitted to a double ionization model (Equation 1), and the pH dependence of Km data and the NMR titration findings were fitted to a single-ionization model (Equation 2). kobs=klim1×10(pK1−pH)+klim21+10(pK1−pH)+10(pH−pK2) eq.1 kobs=klim1+klim2×10(pH−pK)1+10(pH−pK) eq.2 NMR Spectrometry—Protein samples were dialyzed against 25 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 6.0, and 10% D2O. Final concentrations for all samples were 1.0 mm protein, with initial sample volumes of 550 μl. Samples were adjusted for a range of pH values (6.00, 6.50, 7.06, 7.50, 8.06, 8.77, 9.30, 9.33, and 11.06) by adding small (microliter) aliquots of 10 mm HCl or 100 mm NaOH directly into the 5-mm NMR tubes, which contained the protein solution. Samples were then gently mixed, and the final pH was measured in the NMR tube using a Mettler Toledo Analytical NMR tube pH electrode and a Corning pH meter. All NMR spectra were collected on the Varian Unity Plus 720 MHz NMR spectrometer with a Varian (1H, 13C, and 15N) triple resonance probe equipped with z-axis pulsed-field gradients. The instrument was operating at the unique proton frequency of 719.86 MHz, with carbon and nitrogen frequencies of 181.02 and 72.95 MHz, respectively. NMR spectra were collected at 293 K. Transmitter and decoupler offsets were referenced with sodium 3-(trimethylsilyl)-1-propanesulfonate as an external standard dissolved in 25 mm phosphate buffer and 10% D2O. Carbon-filtered proton resonances from the 13C(ϵ)-Lys-labeled samples were observed using the 13C HSQC experiment (22Kay L. Keifer P. Saarinen T. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1992; 114: 10663-10665Crossref Scopus (2439) Google Scholar). Transmitter and decoupler offsets and spectral widths for the 1H and 13C dimension were set at 2.59 ppm/2000 Hz and 42.61 ppm/1000 Hz, respectively. Data were collected with 128 transients at 2048 complex points in the 1H and 64 increments in the 13C dimension (linear prediction to 96 points and zero-filling to 128 points were applied during the Fourier transformation process), which resulted in a total data collection time of 4.5 h per pH point. Data were analyzed using Felix 2000 (23Accelrys Inc Felix ND Spectral Processing Software. Release 2000, San Diego, CA2000Google Scholar). Felix matrices were generated for each spectrum in the identical fashion (i.e. matrix size, linear prediction in the carbon dimension, phasing parameters in both dimensions, and referencing) to ensure continuity of signals. Quality control spectra to monitor the protein integrity at all pH values were measured on globally 15N-labeled protein using the 15N HSQC experiment (24Mori S. Abeygunawardana C. O'Neil Johnson M. van Zijl P.C.M. J. Magn. Reson. Ser. B. 1995; 108: 94-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (570) Google Scholar). Transmitter and decoupler offsets and spectral widths for the 1H and 15N dimension were set at 4.73 ppm/12,001.20 Hz and 83.57 ppm/7,199.42 Hz, respectively. 15N HSQC spectra were measured over the pH range of 6.0 to 11.5. Data were collected with 32 transients at 2048 complex points in the 1H and 256 increments in the 15N dimension (linear predicted to 384 points and zero-filled to 512 applied during the Fourier transformation process) for a total data collection time of 30 min per pH point. Computational Methods—The thermodynamic integration method was used to determine the free energy change for the protonation of Lys-73 and Lys-146 (a surface lysine with normal pKa) in the wild-type and in the E166A mutant enzymes. The protonation of each residue constitutes one-half of the full thermodynamics cycle used to determine the pKa of Lys-73 (see below). The protein was fully solvated, and the particle mesh Ewald method (PME (25Darden T.A. York D. Pedersen L.G. J. Chem. Phys. 2003; 98: 10089-10092Crossref Scopus (21400) Google Scholar)) was used to treat long range electrostatics as implemented in the Sander module of the AMBER 7 package. The Cornell et al. (26Cornell W.D. Cieplak P. Bayly C.I. Gould I.R. Merz K.M. Ferguson D.M. Spellmeyer D.C. Fox T. Caldwell J.W. Kollman P.A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1995; 117: 5179-5197Crossref Scopus (11640) Google Scholar) force field, with the parm99 parameters, was used to carry out the simulations. Calculation of the pKa of Lys-73, pKa(BH+), was based on the following equation (27Merz Jr., K.M. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1991; 113: 3572-3575Crossref Scopus (65) Google Scholar), 2.3RT[pKa(BH+)−pKa(AH+)]=ΔΔGaq(B−BH+)−ΔΔGaq(A−AH+) eq.3 where pKa(AH+) corresponds to that of Lys-146, expected to have a typical pKa value of 10.8, and pKa(BH+) is the pKa of Lys-73. Free energy simulations using the thermodynamic integration technique were used to determine ΔΔGaq (B – BH+) and ΔΔGaq (A – AH+), the free energy changes for the deprotonation of Lys-73 and Lys-146, respectively. Along with the known pKa of Lys-146, the computed values of ΔΔGaq (B – BH+) and ΔΔGaq (A – AH+) were used in Equation 1 to determine the pKa of Lys-73. The thermodynamic integration method can be used to evaluate the free energy differences between the two states X and Y, GX−GY=ΔG=∫01〈∂V(λ)∂λ〉λdλ eq.4 where λ is a coupling parameter, GX and GY and the free energies of states X and Y, and V(λ) is the potential energy. The integrand is determined by carrying out molecular dynamics simulations at discrete values of λ ranging from 0 to 1. The initial coordinates for the wild-type TEM-1 β-lactamase were taken from the Research Collaboratory for Structural Bioinformatics (www.rcsb.org/pdb/index.html) Protein Data Bank (accession number 1BTL). The E166A mutant enzyme was generated by mutating Glu-166 to alanine in silico using the “mutate” option in the Sybyl 6.9 software package. The enzyme was protonated, and counter ions were added to the enzyme using the “protonate” and “addions” programs, respectively, which are parts of the AMBER 7 package (28Case D.A. Pearlman D.A. Caldwell J.W. Cheatham III, T.E. Wang J. Ross W.S. Simmerling C.L. Darden T.A. Merz K.M. Stanton R.V. Cheng A.L. Vincent J.J. Crowley M. Tsui V. Gohlke H. Radmer R.J. Duan Y. Pitera J. Massova I. Seibel G.L. Singh U.C. Weiner P.K. Kollman P.A. AMBER. 7th Ed. University of California, San Francisco2002Google Scholar). Crystallographic water molecules were retained, and the system was fully solvated in a box of TIP3P (29Jorgensen W.L. Chandraseklar J. Maduar J.D. Impey R.W. Klein M.L. J. Chem. Phys. 1983; 79: 926-935Crossref Scopus (30557) Google Scholar) waters, such that no atom in the enzyme was less than 10 Å from any edge of the box. The total number of atoms in the fully solvated system was 37,012 for the wild-type enzyme and 37,015 for the mutant protein. Before starting the simulations for the free energy calculations, the system was equilibrated based on a combination of energy minimizations, slow heating, and 300 K molecular dynamics simulation, as described in a previous study (30Maveyraud L. Golemi D. Ishiwata A. Meroueh O. Mobashery S. Samama J.P. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2002; 124: 2461-2465Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). All bonds involving hydrogen atoms in the system were constrained using the SHAKE algorithm. Particle mesh Ewald (PME) was used to treat long range electrostatics, and a 9-Å van der Waals cutoff was applied to the system. All simulations were carried out in parallel using the Sander program of the AMBER 7 package on eight processors of a Linux cluster. The integral in Equation 4 was estimated numerically using a 12-point Gaussian quadrature. A total of 40 ps of simulation was carried out at each of the 12 λ values, which consisted of 10 ps of equilibration and 30 ps of data collection. Determination of the protonation state of Lys-73 would clarify its mechanistic role in the catalytic turnover of substrates by class A β-lactamases, and the elucidation of the mechanism of these enzymes would have implications for those of the related enzymes. We have approached this task for the mechanism of the TEM-1 β-lactamase from E. coli, as a representative member of these families of enzymes, by three complementary methods in this report. First, we have generated a lysine analogue, γ-thialysine, by combining site-directed mutagenesis and chemical modification of the cysteine (31Smith H.B. Hartman F.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 4921-4925Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), introduced in place of Lys-73 to perturb its pKa in comparison with the wild-type enzyme. Second, we have evaluated the pKa value of Lys-73 by NMR experiments. Finally, we have evaluated the pKa for Lys-73 by state-of-the-art computational treatment using the molecular dynamics-based thermodynamic integration method. It has been reported by Hermann and Lemke that the side chain of N-acetyl-γ-thialysine titrates at a pKa value of 9.39 (32Hermann P. Lemke K. Hoppe-Seyler's Z. Physiol. Chem. 1968; 349: 390-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). We verified this observation by preparing N-acetyl-S-ethyl[15N]amine-cysteine (i.e. N-acetyl-γ-thialysine with the side chain amine labeled), which gave a pKa of 9.52 ± 0.01 in our hands, in good agreement with the earlier report. The presence of the sulfide moiety in γ-thialysine attenuates the pKa of the side chain by approximately 1 pK unit, compared with N-acetyllysine. This pKa attenuation gives an experimental handle for the evaluation of the influence of residue 73 in the course of enzymic catalysis. γ-Thialysine has been used previously to elucidate the role of lysine residues in the active sites of several proteins such as aspartate aminotransferase (33Planas A. Kirsch J. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 8268-8276Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), ribonuclease A (34Messmore J.M. Fuchs D.N. Raines R.T. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1995; 117: 8057-8060Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar), acetoacetate decarboxylase (35Heighbarger L.A. Gerlt J.A. Kenyon G.L. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 41-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar), and leader peptidase (36Paetzel M. Strynadka N.C.J. Tschantz W.R. Casareno R. Bullinger P.R. Dalbey R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9994-10003Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). We set out to generate a γ-thialysine at position 73 of the TEM-1 β-lactamase. These experiments turned out substantially more complicated than anticipated. For example, to generate γ-thialysine according to earlier methodology (37Toney M.D. Kirsch J.F. Science. 1989; 243: 1485-1488Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar), one generates a cysteine at the position, and then the cysteine thiolate is modified by bromoethylamine to give γ-thialysine. This seemingly straightforward process did not work in our hands with the TEM β-lactamase. After considerable trouble-shooting, we concluded that a disulfide exchange reaction was taking place between the disulfide bond linking residues Cys-77 and Cys-123 and the introduced cysteine at position 73. Hence, the resultant protein was misfolded. We took out the disulfide bond in the enzyme by generating the double mutant C77S/C123A. The choice of the amino acid substitutions was based on earlier precedents (21Laminet A.A. Pluckthun A. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 1469-1477Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 38Schultz S.C.

Frère J.M. Biochem. J. 1997; 321: 413-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). This enzyme showed properties very much similar to those of the wild-type enzyme (e.g. a mere 2- to 3-fold effect on the steady-state kinetic parameters for substrate turnover). These results agreed well with previous studies on the role and effect of the disulfide bridge in the TEM-1 β-lactamase (21Laminet A.A. Pluckthun A. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 1469-1477Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 38Schultz S.C. Dalbadie-McFarland G. Neitzel J.J. Richards J.H. Proteins Struct. Funct.

J. 1997; 321: 413-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Hence, the loss of the disulfide bond was not detrimental from a mechanistic point of view. Having determined this, the triple mutant K73C/C77S/C123A was prepared. We observed that this protein would not express well (2 mg per liter of growth). Despite this challenge, we were able to purify to homogeneity sufficient amounts of this protein for our experiments. The protein w"

We have examined the role of conserved hydrophobic residues that are postulated to stabilize sHSP oligomers. We identified a mutation of Synechocystis Hsp16.6 that impairs function in vivo and in vitro. The V143A mutation is in the C-terminal extension, a region predicted to form an oligomeric interaction with a hydrophobic region that includes the site of a previously characterized mutation, L66A. Both mutants were dimeric, but V143A had a stronger oligomerization defect than L66A. However, V143A protected a model substrate better than L66A. This suggests that although the two regions both play a role in oligomerization, they are not equivalent. Nevertheless, the addition of either dimeric sHSP enhanced the in vitro chaperone activity of wild type Hsp16.6, consistent with models that the sHSP dimers initiate interactions with substrates. Suppressor analysis of V143A identified mutations in the N terminus that restored activity by restabilizing the oligomer. These mutants were allele-specific and unable to suppress L66A, although they suppressed a dimeric C-terminal truncation of Hsp16.6. Conversely, suppressors of L66A were unable to suppress either V143A or the truncation, although they, like suppressors of V143A, stabilize the Hsp16.6 oligomer. We interpret these data as evidence that the mutations V143A and L66A stabilize two different dimeric structures and as further support that sHSP dimers are active species.

Small heat shock proteins (sHSPs) 1The abbreviations used are: sHSP, small heat shock protein; WT, wild type; luc, firefly luciferase; SEC, size exclusion chromatography. are a family of ATP-independent chaperones that, in vitro, can protect denaturing proteins from irreversible aggregation by forming large, soluble complexes with their substrates (for reviews, see Refs. 1MacRae T.H. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2000; 57: 899-913Google Scholar, 2van Montfort R.L.M. Slingsby C. Vierling E. Adv. Protein Chem. 2002; 59: 105-156Google Scholar, 3Haslbeck M. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2002; 59: 1649-1657Google Scholar). sHSPs do not refold substrates, but sHSP-protected substrates can be refolded by ATP-dependent chaperones such as Hsp70/DnaK (4Ehrnsperger M. Graber S. Gaestel M. Buchner J. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 221-229Google Scholar, 5Lee G.J. Roseman A.M. Saibil H.R. Vierling E. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 659-671Google Scholar). Although the role of sHSPs in vivo is not well defined, established in vitro assays for sHSP activity (i.e. protection of model substrates from aggregation and their subsequent refolding by ATP-dependent chaperones) appear to be closely related to sHSP functions in vivo. In Synechocystis sp. strain PCC 6803 (Synechocystis), a missense mutation of the single sHSP in this organism, Hsp16.6, causes loss of both protection of a model substrate in vitro and the ability of cells to survive heat treatment (thermotolerance). Both activities are restored by intragenic suppressors of this mutant (6Giese K.C. Vierling E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 46310-46318Google Scholar). Mogk et al. (7Mogk A. Deuerling E. Vorderwülbecke S. Vierling E. Bukau B. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 50: 585-595Google Scholar) demonstrated that the sHSPs in Escherichia coli act with both DnaK and ClpB to facilitate the removal of aggregated protein after heat stress, in good agreement with in vitro observations of Hsp70/DnaK-dependent reactivation of sHSP-protected substrates (8Veinger L. Diamant S. Buchner J. Goloubinoff P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11032-11037Google Scholar, 9Lee G.J. Vierling E. Plant Physiol. 2000; 122: 189-198Google Scholar). Thus, it appears that sHSPs function to prevent or reduce irreversible protein aggregation during heat stress in vivo. The mechanism of the chaperone activity of sHSPs is unknown. Current models suggest that changes in sHSP oligomerization are essential. Almost all sHSPs form oligomers (2van Montfort R.L.M. Slingsby C. Vierling E. Adv. Protein Chem. 2002; 59: 105-156Google Scholar), and these can be destabilized at high temperatures (10Haslbeck M. Walke S. Stromer T. Ehrnsperger M. White H.E. Chen S. Saibil H.R. Buchner J. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6744-6751Google Scholar, 11van Montfort R.L.M. Basha E. Friedrich K.L. Slingsby C. Vierling E. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 1025-1030Google Scholar). Disassembly of the oligomer into dimers has been proposed to be a required step in the chaperone process (10Haslbeck M. Walke S. Stromer T. Ehrnsperger M. White H.E. Chen S. Saibil H.R. Buchner J. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6744-6751Google Scholar). Disassembly could produce an active state of the sHSP that can bind unfolding proteins (10Haslbeck M. Walke S. Stromer T. Ehrnsperger M. White H.E. Chen S. Saibil H.R. Buchner J. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6744-6751Google Scholar), perhaps by exposure of hydrophobic residues that bind substrates (5Lee G.J. Roseman A.M. Saibil H.R. Vierling E. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 659-671Google Scholar, 11van Montfort R.L.M. Basha E. Friedrich K.L. Slingsby C. Vierling E. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 1025-1030Google Scholar, 12Raman B. Rao C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23559-23564Google Scholar). However, the oligomeric state is also essential, as it appears that reassembly of sHSP dimers into a complex with substrate is required for protection of substrates (6Giese K.C. Vierling E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 46310-46318Google Scholar, 13Leroux M.R. Melki R. Gordon B. Batelier G. Candido E.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24646-24656Google Scholar, 14Rogalla T. Ehrnsperger M. Preville X.

Therefore, identification of contacts involved in oligomerization is important for understanding the mechanism of sHSP chaperone activity. The crystal structures of two sHSPs provide information about regions involved in oligomerization. The structures of Methanococcus jannaschii Hsp16.5 (17Kim K.K. Kim R. Kim S.H. Nature. 1998; 394: 595-599Google Scholar) and Triticum aestivum Hsp16.9 from wheat (11van Montfort R.L.M. Basha E. Friedrich K.L. Slingsby C. Vierling E. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 1025-1030Google Scholar) reveal that despite the difference in the size of their oligomers (24 and 12 subunits, respectively), there is a high degree of similarity between the two sHSPs. Both proteins form oligomers that are composed of dimers, and the conserved ∼100 amino acid α-crystallin domains (18de Jong W.W. Caspers G.J. Leunissen J.A. Int. J. Biol. Macromol. 1998; 22: 151-162Google Scholar) have very similar β-sandwich structures. Oligomerization of M. jannaschii Hsp16.5 and T. aestivum Hsp16.9 involves a conserved interdimer interface between two hydrophobic regions: a “patch” of hydrophobicity on one surface of the β-sandwich of the α-crystallin domain and the hydrophobic residues in a basic-X(I/V)X(I/V) motif of the C-terminal extension (β-strand 10). The conservation of these residues among sHSPs (18de Jong W.W. Caspers G.J. Leunissen J.A. Int. J. Biol. Macromol. 1998; 22: 151-162Google Scholar) is consistent with essential functions of these regions. The hypothesis that interactions between the C-terminal extension and the hydrophobic patch are essential to sHSP oligomerization and function is supported by some, but not all, mutagenesis experiments in vitro and has not been tested in vivo. Mutation of either Ile residue to Ala in the basic-X(I/V)X(I/V) motif of HspH from Bradyrhizobium japonicum destabilized the oligomer and led to loss of protection of citrate synthase from aggregation (15Studer S. Obrist M. Lentze N. Narberhaus F. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 3578-3586Google Scholar). A truncation of the C terminus that deleted this motif also reduced the oligomerization of M. jannaschii Hsp16.5 (19Kim R. Lai L. Lee H.H. Cheong G.W. Kim K.K. Wu Z. Yokota H. Marqusee S. Kim S.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 8151-8155Google Scholar) but not of Hsp16.2 from Caenorhabditis elegans (13Leroux M.R. Melki R. Gordon B. Batelier G. Candido E.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24646-24656Google Scholar). Furthermore, while Kim et al. (19Kim R. Lai L. Lee H.H. Cheong G.W. Kim K.K. Wu Z. Yokota H. Marqusee S. Kim S.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 8151-8155Google Scholar) found that the C-terminal truncation of M. jannaschii Hsp16.5 led to formation of a tetramer, it was still able to maintain substrate solubility. The role of the hydrophobic patch is even less well examined. We identified a mutation of a conserved hydrophobic residue in the patch, L66A of Synechocystis Hsp16.6, that severely reduced both oligomeric stability and chaperone activity (6Giese K.C. Vierling E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 46310-46318Google Scholar), but this region has not been investigated in other sHSPs. Although on the whole, these studies argue for a role of the hydrophobic C-terminal motif and patch in both oligomerization and chaperone activity, the requirements for either are not certain. Furthermore, these studies have primarily assayed sHSP activity using model substrates in vitro, making it possible that the results do not reflect cellular needs for sHSP activity. We took advantage of the requirement of Hsp16.6 for thermotolerance in Synechocystis to dissect genetically the role of the C-terminal motif and to compare it with that of the hydrophobic patch. The relationship of in vivo phenotypes to oligomeric stability and chaperone activity was also compared. Point mutants at Val143, the second hydrophobic residue in the basic-X(I/V)X(I/V) motif of Hsp16.6, decreased the viability of heat-stressed cells, providing the first direct evidence for the importance of this motif in vivo. The V143A protein was dimeric and had impaired chaperone activity in vitro. V143A disrupted oligomeric stability more, but chaperone activity less, than L66A, a mutation in the hydrophobic patch, suggesting the two hydrophobic regions do not have equivalent functions. Intragenic suppressors of V143A were then selected in Synechocystis as second-site mutations that restored cellular thermotolerance. These suppressors were located in the N terminus and greatly stabilized the Hsp16.6 oligomer. Contrary to expectations, the suppressors of V143A were not able to suppress L66A. Likewise, suppressors of L66A, which also stabilize the Hsp16.6 oligomer (6Giese K.C. Vierling E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 46310-46318Google Scholar), did not suppress V143A. In total, although both V143A and L66A form stable dimers, there are structural and/or functional differences between the two mutants. We suggest that they may stabilize two distinct functional states of Hsp16.6. Plasmids—Synechocystis hsp16.6 and its mutants were subcloned into the HpaI and ApaI sites of the plasmid pNaive (6Giese K.C. Vierling E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 46310-46318Google Scholar) containing a spectinomycin resistance marker for transformation into Synechocystis. For expression in E. coli, the genes were inserted into the same sites in pJC20/Hpa, a modified version of pJC20 (20Clos J. Brandau S. Protein Expr. Purif. 1994; 5: 133-137Google Scholar) described previously (6Giese K.C. Vierling E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 46310-46318Google Scholar). Site-directed mutagenesis of Val143 was performed by PCR with a degenerate oligonucleotide that could mutate hsp16.6 codon 143 to code for Gly, Ala, Ser, Thr, and Arg, using pJC/Hpa hsp16.6 as a template. A pool of the HpaI/ApaI fragments of the PCR product was then cloned into pNaive as above. Synechocystis Strains and Growth Conditions—Synechocystis sp. strain PCC 6803 was grown at 30 °C on BG-11 medium (21Rippka R. Deruelles J. Waterbury J.B. Herdman M. Stanier R.Y. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1979; 111: 1-61Google Scholar), supplemented with 5 mm glucose, as described previously (6Giese K.C. Vierling E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 46310-46318Google Scholar). The strain HK-1/ΔClpB1, which carries a deletion of both hsp16.6 and clpB1, was used as the parental strain in all Synechocystis transformations. Cells were transformed as described by Williams (22Williams J.G.K. Methods Enzymol. 1988; 167: 766-778Google Scholar), with pNaive (to create the Hsp16.6 deletion strain), pNaive.16 (for the wild type (WT) Hsp16.6-expressing strain), or mutant variants and selected for increasing spectinomycin resistance at concentrations up to 250 μg/ml spectinomycin dihydrochloride. Synechocystis Thermotolerance—Assays were performed as previously described (6Giese K.C. Vierling E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 46310-46318Google Scholar). Briefly, cells growing at log phase were serially diluted five times at 1:10, and 5 μl of each dilution was spotted onto plates containing 20 ml of BG-11/agar with 140 mm MgSO4 and 5 mm glucose. Cells were heated at 44 °C for up to 10 h and then transferred to a lit 30 °C growth chamber until colonies became visible. Colony numbers were compared with unstressed samples to calculate the viability of each sample. Hsp16.6 Accumulation in Synechocystis—Log phase cells were incubated for 2 h at 42 °C. Cells were pelleted and lysed in SDS sample buffer (30 mm Tris, pH 6.8, 5% glycerol, 2% SDS, 0.01% bromphenol blue, 2.5% β-mercaptoethanol). Protein concentration was determined by Coomassie Blue binding (23Ghosh S. Gepstein S. Heikkila J.J. Dumbroff E.B. Anal. Biochem. 1988; 169: 227-233Google Scholar). Total cellular protein (0.5 μg) was loaded onto a 15% SDS-PAGE gel, which was immunoblotted with anti-Hsp16.6 antiserum (6Giese K.C. Vierling E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 46310-46318Google Scholar). Protein Purification—Hsp16.6 and mutant variants were purified from the E. coli strain BL21 (Stratagene). Purification was performed as described previously (6Giese K.C. Vierling E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 46310-46318Google Scholar), except that an additional purification step was added. Protein eluted from a DEAE column was diluted, and salt was added to bring it to 4 m NaCl and 1.5 m urea. Protein was loaded onto a 5-ml HiTrap Butyl column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated in 50 mm NaPO4, pH 7.3, 4 m NaCl, 1.5 m urea, and 1 mm dithiothreitol and eluted with a 4 to 0 m NaCl gradient. Protein was stored in 20 mm NaPO4, pH 7.3, 20 mm NaCl, and 1 mm dithiothreitol. The concentration of WT Hsp16.6 was determined using an extinction coefficient E280 = 5960 m-1 cm-1 (6Giese K.C. Vierling E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 46310-46318Google Scholar). Mutant proteins that had no contaminants detectable by Coomassie Blue stain were measured similarly, except that the extinction coefficient E280 = 7450 m-1 cm-1 (calculated as described by Pace et al. (24Pace C.N. Vajdos F. Fee L. Grimsley G. Gray T. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 2411-2423Google Scholar)) was used for proteins with S2Y or N7Y mutations. Proteins with detectable contaminants (but typically at least 95% pure) were assayed by the method of Bradford (25Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Google Scholar), using WT Hsp16.6 as the standard. Size Exclusion Chromatography (SEC)—SEC was performed by high pressure liquid chromatography. 100 μl of 24 μm sHSP samples were injected onto a Bio-Sil SEC 400-5 column (Bio-Rad) equilibrated with 20 mm NaPO4, pH 7.3, 20 mm NaCl or with 200 mm NaPO4, pH 7.3, 200 mm NaCl, when looking at sHSP-substrate complexes. The column flow rate was 1 ml/min. Buffer and column were maintained at room temperature. Samples were heated as described and centrifuged 15 min, 16,000 × g before being injected onto column. Thyroglobulin (670 kDa), β-amylase (200 kDa), bovine serum albumin (66 kDa), carbonic anhydrase (29 kDa), and myoglobin (17 kDa) were used as molecular weight standards. Proteins were detected by absorbance at 220 nm. Cross-linking of Hsp16.6—Glutaraldehyde cross-linking was performed based on the method of Craig (26Craig W.S. Methods Enzymol. 1988; 156: 333-345Google Scholar). 48 or 192 μm Hsp16.6 in 20 mm NaPO4, pH 7.3, 20 mm NaCl was heated at 42 °C for 7.5 min and cooled briefly on ice. A 250-fold molar excess of glutaraldehyde was added, and reactions were incubated at room temperature for 1 h. Reactions were quenched by the addition of a 10-fold molar excess of glycine over glutaraldehyde. 30 μg of sHSP were run on 5-15% SDS-PAGE gels and Coomassie Blue-stained. Luciferase Protection Assays—Firefly luciferase (luc) reactivation was performed as described previously (6Giese K.C. Vierling E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 46310-46318Google Scholar). Mixtures of Hsp16.6 and luc at concentrations indicated were prepared in 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 15 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, and 2 mm dithiothreitol (D buffer) and were heated at 42 °C for 7.5 min. In refolding experiments, samples were diluted to a final sHSP concentration of 30 nm in 60% rabbit reticulocyte lysate in D buffer with 2 mm ATP and allowed to refold at 31 °C. Luc activity was measured at time points from 0 to 2 h. To determine aggregation-protection, samples were centrifuged (15 min, 16,000 × g at 4 °C) directly after heating, and soluble and pelleted fractions were run on 15% SDS-PAGE. Hsp16.6 Solubility—Resistance of sHSPs to aggregation at high temperatures was tested by heating 24 μm sHSP in D buffer at 55 °C for 24 h. Samples were then centrifuged for 15 min, 16,000 × g at 4 °C, and the amount of protein in the soluble fractions was compared with unheated samples after SDS-PAGE and Coomassie Blue staining. Isolation of Suppressors—Random mutagenesis of the hsp16.6 V143A gene was performed with manganese-based, degenerate PCR, as described previously (6Giese K.C. Vierling E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 46310-46318Google Scholar). Mutated genes were subcloned into the plasmid pNaive, and pools of plasmids were transformed into the Synechocystis strain HK-1/ΔClpB1. Plasmid integration was selected for with increasing spectinomycin, up to 250 μg/ml, before replica-plating colonies to plates containing 140 mm MgSO4. Plates were heated at 44 °C for 10 h and allowed to recover for up to 10 days. Only cells that survived to a significant degree, creating large patches of growth, were selected as putative suppressors. Genomic DNA was isolated from these cell lines and used to amplify the hsp16.6 gene for sequencing. Mutants were recloned into pNaive and transformed into HK-1/ΔClpB1 cells, in order to verify heat resistance using the quantitative assay described above. Mutations at Val143 Are Deleterious to in Vivo Function of Hsp16.6—As described above, sHSP interactions between the hydrophobic patch in the α-crystallin domain and conserved hydrophobic amino acids in the C-terminal extension are postulated to be crucial for oligomerization and chaperone activity. In order to test for a requirement for this interaction in cellular thermotolerance, we examined the effect of mutagenesis of Val143 in the Synechocystis sHSP, Hsp16.6. Val143 is the second of the two hydrophobic residues in the conserved motif, basic-X(I/V)X(I/V), in the C-terminal extension. It was also of interest to compare mutations of Val143 to those of L66A in the hydrophobic patch, which we characterized previously (6Giese K.C. Vierling E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 46310-46318Google Scholar). Based on the M. jannaschii Hsp16.5 structure, the residues Leu66 and Val143 in Hsp16.6 may be in close proximity in this oligomeric interface (17Kim K.K. Kim R. Kim S.H. Nature. 1998; 394: 595-599Google Scholar). Therefore, comparison of these mutants would test the hypothesis that these two hydrophobic regions share a single function, namely oligomerization, both in vivo and in vitro. In all experiments, we used a strain of Synechocystis with a deletion of clpB1 due to its enhanced sensitivity to Hsp16.6 activity (6Giese K.C. Vierling E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 46310-46318Google Scholar). Because the parental strain is also Δhsp16.6, transformation with an hsp16.6 mutant creates a strain that expresses only the mutant sHSP. Synechocystis colonies transformed with hsp16.6 containing random mutations at Val143 were screened for loss of thermotolerance. Colonies that did not survive a heat treatment of 8 h at 44 °C were isolated from replicate, unstressed plates and used to recover the hsp16.6 gene for sequencing. V143A, V143G, V143S, and V143T were identified as loss-of-function mutants. All four mutants have similar phenotypes in vivo, with viabilities of 0.5-2% after 8 h at 44 °C compared with ∼30% for the WT Hsp16.6 strain (data not shown). None of these mutations of Val143 had an effect on Hsp16.6 accumulation in Synechocystis at 42 °C (Fig. 1A). Therefore, the loss of cell viability during heat stress is due to changes in sHSP function, not abundance. These data are consistent with an essential function of the C-terminal motif in Hsp16.6. These mutations all reduce the hydrophobicity at residue 143, suggesting that this is the critical change. It is possible that the β-branched nature of Val (and Ile, which is often found in this position of the motif) is an essential feature at this position. However, since Thr is also β-branched and cannot substitute for Val, a β-branched residue is clearly not sufficient for sHSP function. Due to the similarity of phenotypes of all four mutants, only the most conservative mutation, V143A, was analyzed further. As shown in Fig. 1B, after 10 h at 44 °C, the Hsp16.6 V143A strain is ∼100-fold less viable than +Hsp16.6, a strain expressing WT Hsp16.6, and ∼100-fold more viable than the ΔHsp16.6 strain. The V143A strain is also more thermotolerant than the one that expresses the L66A mutant, which may reflect differences in the activities of the mutants, but could also be the result of the reduced accumulation of L66A (Fig. 1A). V143A Destabilizes the Hsp16.6 Oligomer—The V143A protein was compared with WT Hsp16.6 and the L66A mutant by SEC, in order to relate in vivo activity to oligomeric stability. SEC of 24 μm sHSP performed at room temperature showed that the majority of the V143A protein eluted at a time consistent with a dimer, under conditions where WT Hsp16.6 was oligomeric (Fig. 2A). L66A was more oligomeric than V143A and eluted as a mixture of oligomer and dimer. Both mutant proteins were destabilized further by heating; after heating and cooling (42 °C for 7.5 min, followed by 20 min at 4 °C prior to injection onto the column), V143A eluted entirely as a small species (Fig. 2B). Although L66A also appeared to be fully dimeric after heat treatment, it eluted more slowly than V143A. The difference in their elution times may be due to an interaction of L66A with the column matrix and/or structural differences. In order to determine whether the small species of V143A and L66A both represent dimers, glutaraldehyde cross-linking was performed on 48 μm sHSP samples that had been heated and cooled as above. The resulting species were analyzed by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 2C). After a 1-h exposure to glutaraldehyde, the oligomeric WT Hsp16.6 was cross-linked to form a variety of species, and a significant fraction was larger than tetramers. In contrast, the majority of both L66A and V143A were cross-linked as dimers, although small fractions of both proteins cross-linked as trimers, tetramers, and larger species. This indicates that whereas both mutant proteins were significantly dimeric after heat treatment, consistent with the SEC results, glutaraldehyde could trap both proteins in larger structures during the 1-h incubation. There is a reproducible difference between L66A and V143A in the appearance of the dimer bands. The dimer of L66A consistently ran as a diffuse band, relative to the more compact band in the V143A sample. Dimeric sHSPs Have Different Chaperone Activities in Vitro—V143A provides better cellular thermotolerance than L66A, yet it appears to be more defective than L66A at oligomerizing. In order to understand these distinctions better, we compared the chaperone activities of these two mutants in vitro using firefly luc as a heat-sensitive model substrate. When heated in the presence of an sHSP, luc can subsequently be refolded by ATP-dependent chaperones, such as those found in reticulocyte lysate, to a far greater extent than when luc is heated alone (5Lee G.J. Roseman A.M. Saibil H.R. Vierling E. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 659-671Google Scholar). We compared the protection provided by the mutant sHSPs over a range of concentrations (Fig. 3A). The protection of 1 μm luc provided by 24 μm L66A or V143A was very low (6.3 ± 1.3 and 6.0 ± 0.3%, respectively), similar to the reactivation of luc heated in the presence of an equal weight of bovine serum albumin (4.3 ± 1.6%). In contrast, 50 ± 7% of the WT-protected luc was refoldable. Although at 24 μm V143A was unable to protect luc, its activity was greatly enhanced by raising the concentration. We tested concentrations as high as 240 μm sHSP, preserving a constant molar ratio of 24 sHSP:1 luc. The chaperone activity of V143A was low at ≤48 μm but improved significantly at higher concentrations. At 144 μm and higher, V143A was able to protect luc so that at least 65% could be refolded, which is even slightly better than the 50% refolding from WT. Thus, the protection defect of V143A is concentration-dependent. In contrast, the effect of raising the concentration of L66A was small. While 24 μm L66A allowed 6.1% of the 1 μm luc to refold, 240 μm L66A protected only 9.0 ± 0.9% of the 10 μm luc. We have never observed the activity of L66A to approach that of WT at this 24:1 ratio, although higher concentrations of L66A can protect 1 μm luc nearly as well as WT (6Giese K.C. Vierling E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 46310-46318Google Scholar). As observed previously for L66A (6Giese K.C. Vierling E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 46310-46318Google Scholar), V143A allowed luc to refold significantly faster than WT-protected luc, with half of the refolding completed in less than 10 min versus nearly 30 min with WT (Fig. 3B). The experiment shown was performed with samples where 240 μm sHSP was heated with 10 μm luc. At low concentrations of V143A, where it was a poor chaperone, the rates of refolding were also rapid (data not shown). Thus, both dimeric sHSPs allow luc to refold rapidly. The concentration dependence of the chaperone activity of V143A suggested that it might be oligomeric at high concentrations. We performed glutaraldehyde cross-linking of heat-treated sHSP at 192 μm (Fig. 2C), a concentration at which V143A protects luc somewhat better than WT does and much better than L66A does (Fig. 3A). Significant fractions of V143A and L66A cross-linked as large multimers (>200 kDa), but both remained more dimeric than WT. This indicates that V143A is able to function well as a chaperone under conditions where it is less oligomeric than WT Hsp16.6. In this high concentration cross-linking experiment, there was a concern that nonspecific cross-linking could occur. We used a mutant that is severely impaired in oligomerization to control for this. K142stop, which is missing the last five amino acids of the C-terminal extension, ran exclusively as a dimer by SEC, even before heat treatment (data not shown). In Fig. 2C, K142stop cross-linked predominantly as a dimer at both 48 and 192 μm, suggesting that the high molecular weight species observed with 192 μm L66A and V143A are indeed the result of assembly of these proteins into large structures. The cross-linking and SEC data demonstrate that after heat treatment V143A and L66A are similar but not identical in oligomerization and do not explain the advantage that V143A has over L66A at protecting luc at high concentrations or during heat stress in vivo. Therefore, we considered that there might be functional differences between the two mutants that are distinct from their differences in oligomeric stability. The accumulation of L66A in Synechocystis is significantly lower than that of WT and V143A (Fig. 1A). We considered that L66A might be less stable than the other sHSPs, which could account for its low activity both in vivo and in vitro. We looked for protein instability by heating 24 μm samples of all three proteins at 55 °C. Even after 24 h at 55 °C, L66A and V143A r"

Interferons regulate T-cell function and activation, but the precise signaling mechanisms by which they mediate such effects have not been elucidated. We determined whether PKC-θ is engaged in interferon (INF) signaling in T-cells. Both Type I (α, β) and Type II (γ) IFNs induced phosphorylation of PKC-θ in human T-cell lines and primary human T-lymphocytes. Such phosphorylation of PKC-θ resulted in activation of its kinase domain, suggesting that this kinase plays a functional role in interferon signaling. Consistent with this, inhibition of PKC-θ protein expression using small interfering RNAs (siRNA) abrogated IFN-α- and IFN-γ-dependent gene transcription via GAS elements. Similarly, blocking of PKC-θ kinase activity by overexpression of a dominant-negative PKC-θ mutant also blocked GAS-driven transcription, further demonstrating a requirement for PKC-θ in IFN-dependent transcriptional activation. The effects of PKC-θ on IFN-dependent gene transcription were not mediated by regulation of the IFN-activated STAT pathway, as siRNA-mediated PKC-θ knockdown had no effects on STAT1 phosphorylation and binding of STAT1-containing complexes to SIE/GAS elements. On the other hand, siRNA-mediated PKC-θ inhibition blocked phosphorylation/activation of MKK4, suggesting that interferon-dependent PKC-θ activation regulates downstream engagement of MAP kinase pathways. Altogether, these findings demonstrate that PKC-θ is an interferon-inducible kinase and strongly suggest that it plays an important role in the generation of interferon-responses in T-cells.

Several different STAT-containing signaling complexes are formed during engagement of the Type I or II IFN receptors to regulate transcription. Type I interferons form ISGF3 (STAT2·STAT1·IRF-9) complexes that regulate gene transcription via binding to interferon-stimulated response elements, as well as other complexes (STAT1·STAT1, STAT1·STAT3, STAT3·STAT3, STAT5·STAT5, and CrkL·STAT5) that bind to GAS elements to regulate transcription (6Darnell Jr., J.E.

The activation of STATs is regulated by JAK-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation, which is required for their translocation to the nucleus. Phosphorylation of serine 727 in the C-terminal domains of STAT1 and STAT3 is also induced by both Type I and II interferons, and is required for full transcriptional activation and the generation of IFN-dependent biological responses (29Wen Z.

The serine phosphorylation of STAT proteins is regulated by more than one serine kinase, including Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent kinase II (35Nair J.S. DaFonseca C.J. Tjernberg A. Sun W.

The phosphatidylinositol 3′-kinase pathway also exhibits regulatory effects on STAT1 serine 727 phosphorylation (38Nguyen H. Ramana C.V. Bayes J. Stark G.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 33361-33368Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar), likely via downstream engagement of PKC-δ (37Deb D.K. Sassano A. Lekmine F. Majchrzak B. Verma A. Kambhampati S. Uddin S. Rahman A. Fish E.N. Platanias L.C. J. Immunol. 2003; 171: 267-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). In addition to the direct demonstration of an engagement of PKC-δ in Type I and II interferon signaling, there has been previous evidence pointing toward important roles for members of the PKC family on the regulation of IFN-responsive genes (39Yu F. Floyd-Smith G. Exp. Cell Res. 1997; 234: 240-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The significant homology that the genes for many members of the PKC family exhibit, as well as the tissue-specific distribution of several PKC isoforms, suggest that more than one PKC isoform may be activated by interferons to play distinct or complementary roles in the generation of IFN responses. In the present study we determined whether PKC-θ participates in Type I and II interferon signaling in T-cells. Our data provide the first evidence that this PKC isoform is activated in an interferon-dependent manner in cell lines of T-cell origin and primary human T-lymphocytes. Such activation appears to play an important functional role in IFN signaling, as it is required for IFN-γ-dependent gene transcription via GAS elements and regulates downstream engagement of MAP kinase kinase 4 (MKK4). Cells and Reagents—The Molt-4 and Jurkat acute T-cell leukemia cell lines were grown in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and antibiotics. U2OS cells were grown in McCoy medium, supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and antibiotics. Human recombinant IFN-α2 was provided by Hoffmann-La Roche. Human recombinant IFN-β was provided by Biogen Inc. Polyclonal antibodies against PKC-θ, PKC-α, PKC-β, PKC-δ, PKC-ϵ, MKK4, and STAT1 were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Antibodies against the phosphorylated form of PKC-θ on Thr538, the phosphorylated form of MKK4 at Thr261, and the phosphorylated form of mTOR on Ser2448 were obtained from Cell Signaling Inc., and were used for immunoblotting. An antibody that specifically recognizes the phosphorylated form of STAT1 on tyrosine 701 was obtained from UBI and was used for immunoblotting. The pharmacological inhibitors LY294002 and rapamycin were purchased from Calbiochem Inc. (La Jolla, CA). Cell Lysis, Immunoprecipitations, and Immunoblotting—Cells were incubated in the presence or absence of 1 × 104 IU/ml of the indicated interferons for the indicated times, and lysed in phosphorylation lysis buffer as previously described (40Yetter A.

In the experiments in which the effects of pharmacological inhibitors on the phosphorylation of PKC-θ were examined, the cells were preincubated for 30 min in the presence or absence of LY294002 (50 μm) or rapamycin (40 nm), prior to treatment with the indicated interferons. Immunoprecipitations and immunoblotting using an enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) method were performed as previously described (40Yetter A. Uddin S. Krolewski J.J. Jiao H. Yi T. Platanias L.C. J.

PKC-θ and MKK-4 Kinase Assays—Cells were incubated in the presence or absence of the indicated interferons for the indicated times at 37 °C. The cells were subsequently lysed in phosphorylation lysis buffer (40Yetter A. Uddin S. Krolewski J.J. Jiao H. Yi T. Platanias L.C. J. Biol.

The immune complexes were subsequently washed three times with phosphorylation lysis buffer containing 0.1% Triton X-100 and 2 times with kinase buffer (25 mm HEPES, 25 mm MgCl2, 25 mm β-glycerophosphate, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm Na3VO4, and 20 μm ATP) and resuspended in 30 μl of kinase buffer containing 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP and 5 μg of histone H1 protein. The reaction was incubated for 30 min at room temperature and was terminated by the addition of SDS sample buffer. Proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE, and the phosphorylated form of histone H1 was detected by autoradiography. For MKK-4 kinase assays, lysates were immunoprecipitated with an anti-MKK4 antibody, and 1 μg of recombinant p38 (UBI) was used as an exogenous substrate. Isolation and Expansion of Normal Lymphocytes from Peripheral Blood—Peripheral blood was collected from healthy volunteers, after obtaining informed consent approved by the Institutional Review Board (IRB) of Northwestern University. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were separated by Ficoll-Hypaque gradient sedimentation and the lymphocyte interface band was aspirated and washed in RPMI, 10% fetal bovine serum. The cells were stimulated with phytohemagglutinin (2.5 μg/ml) for 72 h in RPMI supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and were subsequently incubated with the indicated doses of interferons for the indicated times. SiRNA Transfections—SiRNA duplexes (siRNAs) were synthesized and purified by Qiagen Inc. The PKC-θ target sequences were: siRNA1 (5′-AAACCACCGTGGAGCTCTACT-3′) and siRNA 2 (5′-AAGAGCCCGACCTTCTGTGAA-3′). Molt-4 cells were transfected with a mixture of the PKC-θ-specific siRNAs or control scrambled siRNA by electroporation. 48 h after transfection, the cells were treated with the indicated interferons for the indicated times and processed for immunoblotting studies or luciferase promoter assays. Luciferase Reporter Assays—Cells were transfected with a β-galactosidase expression vector and a luciferase reporter gene containing eight GAS elements linked to a minimal prolactin promoter (8X-GAS) by electroporation. The 8X-GAS construct (42Horvai A.E. Xu L. Korzus E. Brard G. Kalafus D. Mullen T-M. Rose D.W. Rosenfeld M.G. Glass C.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The pAP-1-luc construct was obtained from Stratagene. In the experiments in which the effects of overexpression of wild-type PKC-θ, a kinase-defective PKC-θ mutant (PKC-θ-K409R) (43Baier-Bitterlich G. Uberall F. Bauer B. Fresser F. Wachter H.

Biol. 1996; 16: 1842-1850Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) were determined, the cells were co-transfected with either control empty vector or the indicated cDNAs. Forty-eight hours after transfection, triplicate cultures were either left untreated or treated with IFN, as indicated. The cells were washed twice with cold phosphate-buffered saline and after cell lysis, luciferase activity was measured using the protocol of the manufacturer (Promega). The measured luciferase activities were normalized for β-galactosidase activity for each sample. Quantitative TaqMan Reverse Transcriptase-PCR—Molt-4 cells were electroporated with either scrambled or PKC-θ-specific siRNA. After 24 h incubation, cells were treated with IFN-α for 5 h. RNA was isolated using the RNeasy kit (Qiagen), and 1 μg of total RNA was reverse transcribed to cDNA using the OmniScript reverse transcriptase kit and Oligo(dT) primer (Qiagen). Real-time reverse transcriptase-PCR of human IRF-9 and ISG15 genes was carried out by an ABI 7900 Sequence Detection System (64Haslett J.N. Sanoudou D. Kho A.T. Bennett R.R. Greenberg S.A. Kohane I.S. Beggs A.H. Kunkel L.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 15000-15005Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar) using FAM-labeled probes and primers (Applied Biosystems, TaqMan Assays on Demand). Relative quantitation of mRNA levels was plotted as -fold change compared with untreated cells. 18 S ribosomal RNA was used for normalization (33Livak K.J. Schmittgen T.D. Methods. 2001; 25: 402-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (116291) Google Scholar). Briefly, ΔCT values (target gene CT – 18 S CT) for each triplicate sample were averaged, and ΔΔCT was calculated as previously described. mRNA amplification was determined by the formula 2–ΔΔCT (33Livak K.J. Schmittgen T.D. Methods. 2001; 25: 402-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (116291) Google Scholar). We initially determined whether treatment of T-cell-derived human leukemia cell lines with interferons results in phosphorylation and activation of PKC-θ. Molt-4 cells were incubated in the presence or absence of IFN-α, IFN-β, or IFN-γ, and after cell lysis, equal amounts of lysates were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with an antibody against the phosphorylated form of PKC-θ on threonine 538. Both Type I (α and β) and II (γ) IFNs induced strong phosphorylation of PKC-θ, whereas there was no change in the amount of PKC-θ protein detected prior to and after IFN stimulation (Fig. 1, A and B). Similar results were obtained when the Jurkat acute T-cell leukemia cell line was studied (Fig. 1, C and D). To examine whether phosphorylation of PKC-θ by IFNs occurs under more physiologically relevant conditions, we performed studies using primary normal T-lymphocytes, obtained from the peripheral blood of normal donors. Phytohemagglutinin-expanded T-lymphocytes were treated with either IFN-α or IFN-γ, and total cell lysates were resolved by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with the anti-PKC-θ antibody. IFN treatment resulted in phosphorylation of the PKC-θ (Fig. 1, E and F), strongly suggesting that this kinase is activated and plays a role in the generation of IFN responses in T-cells. In subsequent studies, we sought to determine directly whether the kinase domain of PKC-θ is activated in an interferon-dependent manner. Cells were treated with IFN-β or IFN-γ, and after immunoprecipitation of cell lysates with an anti-PKC-θ antibody, in vitro kinase assays were performed on the immunoprecipitates using histone H1 as an exogenous substrate. IFN-β or IFN-γ treatment of Molt-4 cells resulted in strong induction of the kinase activity of PKC-θ, as demonstrated by the phosphorylation of histone H1 used as an exogenous substrate (Fig. 2, A–C). Similar results were obtained when Jurkat cells were stimulated with IFN-α or IFN-γ (Fig. 2, D–F). Thus, both Type I and II IFNs induce activation of the kinase domain of PKC-θ, indicating a functional engagement of this kinase in IFN signaling. In efforts to understand the mechanisms of upstream regulation of PKC-θ during its engagement by the Type I IFN receptor, we determined the effects of pharmacological inhibition of the PI 3′-kinase pathway, which is activated by interferons and has been previously shown to regulate the phosphorylation/activation of PKC-δ (37Deb D.K.

Molt-4 cells were preincubated in the presence or absence of the PI 3′-kinase-specific inhibitor LY294002, and were subsequently treated with IFN-γ. Total cell lysates were subsequently analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with anti-phospho-PKC-θ antibody. Treatment of cells with LY294002 blocked the IFN-γ-dependent phosphorylation of PKC-θ (Fig. 3, A and B). Such phosphorylation was also blocked when cells were pretreated with rapamycin, an inhibitor of mTOR, which has been recently shown to be phosphorylated/activated by Type I (19Lekmine F. Uddin S. Sassano A. Parmar S. Brachmann S.M. Majchrzak B. Sonenberg N. Hay N. Fish E.N. Platanias L.C. J. Biol.

Thus, in addition to regulating activation of the p70 S6 kinase pathway (19Lekmine F. Uddin S. Sassano A. Parmar S. Brachmann S.M. Majchrzak B. Sonenberg N. Hay N. Fish E.N. Platanias L.C. J. Biol.

To better understand the mechanisms by which such regulation occurs, we determined whether PKC-θ interacts with mTOR in intact cells, to possibly act as a substrate for its kinase activity. As expected (19Lekmine F. Uddin S. Sassano A. Parmar S. Brachmann S.M. Majchrzak B. Sonenberg N. Hay N. Fish E.N. Platanias L.C. J. Biol.

When lysates from IFN-α- or IFN-γ-treated cells were immunoprecipitated with an anti-PKC-θ antibody, the activated form of mTOR could be detected in anti-PKC-θ immunoprecipitates (Fig. 3, F and G), suggesting mTOR associates directly or indirectly with PKC-θ to regulate its phosphorylation and activation by interferons. In subsequent studies, we sought to obtain information on the functional role that PKC-θ plays in the generation of IFN responses. A major mechanism by which interferons mediate their biological effects on target cells is the induction of gene transcription via GAS elements, present in the promoters of ISGs (6Darnell Jr., J.E.

To examine whether PKC-θ regulates induction of IFN-dependent transcriptional activation in T-cells, we examined the effects of overexpression of a kinase-inactive/dominant-negative PKC-θ mutant (PKC-θK409R). Molt-4 cells were co-transfected with the 8X-GAS luciferase construct and either control vector alone or the dominant-negative PKC-θ mutant.

Although initiation and maintenance of G2 arrest are known to be regulated by at least two distinct signaling pathways, including those of p38MAPK and ataxia-telangiectasia-mutated (ATM)- and Rad3-related (ATR)-Chk1 in higher eukaryotes, the actual number of signaling pathways involved in this regulation is still elusive. In the present study, we identified human SAD1 (hsSAD1) by searching a sequence data base. The predicted hsSAD1 protein comprises 778 amino acids and shares significant homology with the fission yeast Cdr2, a mitosis-regulatory kinase, and Caenorhabditis elegans SAD1, a neuronal cell polarity regulator. HsSAD1 transcript was expressed ubiquitously with the highest levels of expression in brain and testis. HsSAD1 specifically phosphorylated Wee1A, Cdc25-C, and -B on Ser-642, Ser-216, and Ser-361 in vitro, respectively. Overexpression of hsSAD1 resulted in an increased phosphorylation of Cdc25C on Ser-216 in vivo. DNA damage induced by UV or methyl methane sulfonate but not by IR enhanced endogenous hsSAD1 kinase activity in a caffeine-sensitive manner and caused translocation of its protein from cytoplasm to nucleus. Overexpression of wild-type hsSAD1 induced G2/M arrest in HeLa S2 cells. Furthermore, UV-induced G2/M arrest was partially abrogated by the reduced expression of hsSAD1 using small interfering RNA. These results suggest that hsSAD1 acts as checkpoint kinase upon DNA damage induced by UV or methyl methane sulfonate.

Maintaining the genomic stability of a cell requires a complex network of cell cycle checkpoint mechanism(s) that prevent cell cycle progression when damage to DNA is encountered or key processes are not completed (1Melo J. Toczyski D. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2002; 14: 237-245Google Scholar, 2O'Connell M.J. Walworth N.C. Carr A.M. Trends Cell Biol. 2000; 10: 296-303Google Scholar). After detection of specific DNA or DNA-protein structures, a signal(s) is transduced to effector molecules that implement checkpoint-dependent responses such as cell cycle arrest or apoptosis. In mammals, cell cycle arrest at the G1/S boundary in response to DNA damage is mediated through the transcriptional activation of DNA damage-inducible genes, including p21 cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor, by the p53 tumor suppressor gene (3Kastan M.B.

Pathol. 1999; 187: 112-126Google Scholar, 7Vousden K.H. Cell. 2000; 103: 691-694Google Scholar). Although cells lacking functional p53 are completely defective at the G1 checkpoint upon DNA damage, they retain a checkpoint mechanism at G2/M, which may underlie the resistance of these cells to anticancer drugs (8Waldman T. Lengauer C. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Nature. 1996; 381: 713-716Google Scholar).Checkpoints have been investigated genetically in the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae and the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyhces pombe. In both, several Rad-related proteins are thought to participate in the signaling as well as monitoring processes that detect DNA damage or incomplete DNA replication (9Longhese M.P. Foiani M. Muzi-Falconi M. Lucchini G. Plevani P. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5525-5528Google Scholar). Among these proteins, Rad3, a yeast homolog of human ATM 1The abbreviations used are: ATM, ataxia-telangiectasia-mutated; ATR, ATM- and Rad3-related; hsSAD1, human SAD1; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; AMPK, AMP-activated protein kinase; MARK, microtubule-affinity regulating kinase; MMS, methyl methane sulfonate; GST, glutathione S-transferase; GFP, green fluorescent protein; siRNA, small interfering RNA. 1The abbreviations used are: ATM, ataxia-telangiectasia-mutated; ATR, ATM- and Rad3-related; hsSAD1, human SAD1; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; AMPK, AMP-activated protein kinase; MARK, microtubule-affinity regulating kinase; MMS, methyl methane sulfonate; GST, glutathione S-transferase; GFP, green fluorescent protein; siRNA, small interfering RNA. or ATR, appears to play a central role in both DNA damage and DNA replication checkpoints (10Carr A.M. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1997; 7: 93-98Google Scholar). Furthermore, two checkpoint kinases, Chk1 and Chk2 (Cds1), are required for checkpoint responses at the G2/M phase by acting downstream of several rad gene products including Rad3 (11Walworth N. Davey S. Beach D. Nature. 1993; 363: 368-371Google Scholar, 12Murakami H. Okayama H. Nature. 1995; 374: 817-819Google Scholar). Fission yeast Chk1 and Cds1 phosphorylate Cdc25 at a serine residue within the region of the protein that binds to Rad24 and Rad25, fission yeast homologs of mammalian 14-3-3 protein, suggesting that these kinases act by regulating the binding of Cdc25 to Rad24 and Rad25 (13Furnari B. Blasina A. Boddy M.N. McGowan C.H. Russell P. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 833-845Google Scholar).Several lines of biochemical evidence suggest that mammalian homologs of Chk1 and Chk2 (Cds1), as well as fission yeast kinases, phosphorylate Cdc25-C on Ser-216 and act, at least in part, by regulating the binding of 14-3-3 to Cdc25-C (14Furnari B. Rhind N. Russell P. Science. 1997; 277: 1495-1497Google Scholar, 15Sanchez Y. Wong C. Thoma R.S. Richman R. Wu Z. Piwnica-Worms H. Elledge S.J.

Oncogene. 1999; 18: 3673-3681Google Scholar). However, Chk1- and Chk2-deficient mice demonstrated critical differences in G2/M checkpoint function between yeasts and mammals. Chk1-deficient mice died at an early embryonic stage, and the Chk1-deficient cells showed severe impairment in DNA replication and DNA damage checkpoints (17Takai H. Tominaga K. Motoyama N.

Carattini-Rivera S. DeMayo F. Bradley A. Donehower L.A. Elledge S.J. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1448-1459Google Scholar), whereas yeast Chk1 mutants remained viable and retained an apparently normal response to DNA replication blockage (11Walworth N. Davey S. Beach D. Nature. 1993; 363: 368-371Google Scholar). In addition, Chk2-deficient cells revealed the essential function of Chk2 in the regulation of p53 function but not in the initiation of G2/M arrest upon IR-induced DNA damage (19Hirao A. Kong Y.Y. Matsuoka S. Wakeham A. Ruland J. Yoshida H. Liu D. Elledge S.J. Mak T.W. Science. 2000; 287: 1824-1827Google Scholar, 20Takai H. Naka K. Okada Y. Watanabe M. Harada N. Saito S. Anderson C.W. Appella E. Nakanishi M. Suzuki H. Nagashima K. Sawa H. Ikeda K. Motoyama N. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 5195-5205Google Scholar). Thus, although the existence of mammalian homologs of yeast rad-related genes has suggested the conservation of checkpoint mechanisms, there appeared to be significant differences in the details of their regulation.Stress kinases including mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) have also been reported to be involved in several cell cycle checkpoint systems. The MAPK signaling pathways serve to convey signals into the nucleus, thereby determining whether a cell undergoes division, cell cycle arrest, or apoptosis (21Lewis T.S. Shapiro P.S. Ahn N.G. Adv. Cancer Res. 1998; 74: 49-139Google Scholar, 22Widmann C. Gibson S. Jarpe M.B. Johnson G.L. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: 143-180Google Scholar, 23Schaeffer H.J. Weber M.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 2435-2444Google Scholar). Activation of p42MAPK is required for the G2/M transition in the maturation of Xenopus oocytes (24Palmer A. Gavin A.C. Nebreda A.R. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5037-5047Google Scholar), and inactivation of this kinase releases these cells from G2 arrest at the time of fertilization (25Abrieu A. Fisher D. Simon M.N. Doree M. Picard A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6407-6413Google Scholar). MEK2 activity was recently reported to be necessary for G2 arrest in mammalian cells (26Abbott D.W. Holt J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2732-2742Google Scholar), whereas MEK1 activity is essential for the G2/M transition (27Wright J.H. Munar E. Jameson D.R. Andreassen P.R. Margolis R.L. Seger R. Krebs E.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 11335-11340Google Scholar). p38α has been reported to be involved in Cdc42-induced G1 arrest as well as at the spindle assembly checkpoint (28Molnar A. Theodoras A.M. Zon L.I. Kyriakis J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13229-13235Google Scholar, 29Takenaka K. Moriguchi T. Nishida E. Science. 1998; 280: 599-602Google Scholar). p38 has also been proposed to play an important role in G2 arrest upon DNA damage induced by IR (30Wang X. McGowan C.H. Zhao M. He L. Downey J.S. Fearns C. Wang Y. Huang S. Han J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 4543-4552Google Scholar) and UV (31Bulavin D.V. Higashimoto Y. Popoff I.J. Gaarde W.A. Basrur V. Potapova O. Appella E. Fornace Jr., A.J. Nature. 2001; 411: 102-107Google Scholar). Interestingly, p38 binds and phosphorylates Cdc25-B and -C at serines 309 and 361 and at serine 216, respectively, and phosphorylation of these residues is required for binding to 14-3-3 proteins (31Bulavin D.V. Higashimoto Y. Popoff I.J. Gaarde W.A. Basrur V. Potapova O. Appella E. Fornace Jr., A.J. Nature. 2001; 411: 102-107Google Scholar). Therefore, the mechanism controlling G2/M checkpoint activation after DNA damage is complex, involving at least two different biochemical systems that target Cdc25-B and -C phosphatases. Following DNA damage, different kinases integrate signals from the damaged DNA and other damaged cellular components to regulate Cdc25 inactivation.Fission yeast Cdr2 was first identified as a kinase that regulates the onset of mitosis through regulating Wee1 protein kinase (32Breeding C.S. Hudson J. Balasubramanian M.K. Hemmingsen S.M. Young P.G. Gould K.L. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 3399-3415Google Scholar, 33Kanoh J. Russell P. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 3321-3334Google Scholar). Cdr2 associates with the N-terminal regulatory domain of Wee1 in cell lysates and phosphorylates Wee1 in vitro. Thus, it is possible that a mammalian homolog(s) of Cdr2 could also function in mitotic regulation under genotoxic stress. In the present study, we identified human cDNA corresponding to homolog protein that showed sequence similarity to fission yeast Cdr2. From the results of a search of protein databases using the predicted amino acid sequences, we have found an additional kinase with the highest similarity in Caenorhabditis elegans, called SAD1 (34Crump J.G. Zhen M. Jin Y. Bargmann C.I. Neuron. 2001; 29: 115-129Google Scholar), and we thus termed our protein human SAD1. HsSAD1 phosphorylated Wee1A, Cdc25-C, and Cdc25-B on Ser-642, Ser-216, and Ser-361, respectively. More interestingly, hsSAD1 was activated and translocated into nuclei in response to UV- or methyl methane sulfonate (MMS)-induced DNA damage but not to IR-induced DNA damage. These results suggest that hsSAD1 may be involved in the regulation of G2/M arrest in response to UV- or MMS-induced DNA damage.MATERIALS AND METHODSCloning of Human SAD1 cDNA—The data base of the NCBI (National Center for Biotechnology Information) was searched for sequences that show homology to a protein sequence corresponding to the entire region of SpCdr2. A human clone, NP003948, obtained from the Human Genome Project, was thereby identified. In accordance with the nucleotide sequence information on the NP003948 clone, the hsSAD1 probe was generated by PCR using a set of primers: 5′-CCA TTA TGC GTG TCC AGA GGT-3′ and 5′-TCA GGA GGC TCT GGC AAT CTG-3′. The entire cDNA for hsSAD1 was cloned by conventional screening of a λ phage library of human testis cDNA (Stratagene) with the hsSAD1 probe. The hsSAD1 cDNA contains an in-frame stop codon upstream of the first ATG in the predicted open reading frame. For generation of pcDNA3.1Myc/His6hsSAD1, we first performed PCR with the 5′ primer 5′-TTT GAA TTC GCC ACC ATG TCG TCC GGG GCC AAG GAG-3′ (S-1), the 3′ primer 5′-AAA TCT AGA GGG CAG AGG GGT CCC GTT GGT-3′ (AS-1), and hsSAD1 cDNA as the template. The resulting PCR product was digested with EcoRI and XbaI and then ligated into pcDNA3.1/Myc-HisA (Invitrogen). The plasmid encoding the kinase-dead mutant of hsSAD1 was generated by a two-step PCR with S1 and AS-1, the inner primers 5′-TTG ATG GCC ACC GCC TGA CCC GTG ATG C-3′ and 5′-GCA TCA CGG GTC AGG CGG TCG CCA TCA A-3′, and pcDNA3.1Myc/His6hsSAD1 as the template.Northern Blot Analysis—Polyadenylated RNAs isolated from various human tissues (Clontech) were subjected to Northern blot hybridization as described previously (47Fujita F. Taniguchi Y. Kato T. Narita Y. Furuya A. Ogawa T. Sakurai H. Joh T. Itoh M. Delhase M. Karin M. Nakanishi M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 7780-7793Google Scholar).Production of Recombinant Proteins—Baculoviruses expressing Myc- and His6-tagged hsSAD1 were generated by introducing the EcoRI/PmeI fragment from pcDNA3.1Myc/His6hsSAD1 into pVL1392, which was digested with EcoRI and SmaI. One microgram of pVL1392hsSAD1Myc/His6 was cotransfected into Sf9 cells with 2.5 μg of linearized baculovirus DNA (BaculoGold; Pharmingen).Generation of Polyclonal Antibodies against hsSAD1 Protein—Rabbit polyclonal antibodies to hsSAD1 were generated with purified hsSAD1 expressed in Sf9 cells. Sera were tested for reactivity against purified hsSAD1Myc/His6 expressed in Sf9 and asynchronized A172 cell extracts by Western blotting. Antisera were affinity-purified on CNBr-activated Sepharose 4B (Amersham Biosciences) coupled with purified hsSAD1Myc/His6, and the concentration was adjusted to 0.1 mg/ml.Kinase Assay—Myc/His6-tagged hsSAD1 protein expressed in Sf9 cells was precipitated with antibody to the Myc epitope tag (Medical and Biological Laboratories Co., Ltd.). The kinase activity of the immunoprecipitated proteins was measured by incubation for 30 min at 30 °C in a reaction mixture (30 μl) containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 10 mm MgCl2, 10 mm MnCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10 μm ATP, 185 kBq of [γ-32P]ATP (222 TBq/mmol; PerkinElmer Life Sciences), and GST-fused Wee1A, Cdc25-B, or -C fragment as substrate. The reaction was terminated by the addition of 30 μlof2× sample buffer. The supernatant was subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and autoradiography. For endogenous hsSAD1 kinase assay, A172 cells were treated with UV, MMS, x-ray, or hydroxyurea. The treated cells were then lysed in an immunoprecipitation kinase buffer (50 mm Hepes, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 25 mm EGTA, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1% Tween 20, and 10% glycerol) containing a mixture of protease inhibitors (20 μg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, and 100 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and phosphatase inhibitors (50 mm NaF and 0.1 mm Na3VO4). The cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with α-hsSAD1 antibody, and the immunoprecipitates were assayed for kinase activity using GST-fused Cdc25-C fragment as a substrate.Indirect Immunofluorescence Analysis—A172 cells were treated with UV or x-ray and then fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100, and incubated with either antibodies to hsSAD1 (1:100 dilution) or normal rabbit IgG (1:1000 dilution). Immune complexes were detected with anti-rabbit IgG conjugated with Alexa 488 antibody (1:1000 dilution) for 1 h in the dark.Transfection and Fluorescence-activated Cell Sorter Analysis—HeLa S2 cells (5 × 105 cells/10-cm dish) were cotransfected with 2 μg of pcDNA3.1Myc/His6hsSAD1 and 1 μg of pME18S-GFP using a Mirus-TransIT-LT1 kit (Mirus). Thirty hours after transfection, cells were harvested and fixed in 70% ice-cold ethanol. The fixed cells were stained with propidium iodide and analyzed by flow cytometry to determine the DNA content of green fluorescent protein (GFP)-negative (not transfected) and GFP-positive (transfected) cells. The cell cycle profiles were analyzed by ModiFitLT model programs according to the manufacturer's instructions.Quantitative Real-time PCR—Quantitative real-time PCR was performed using an ABI7700 sequence detector (PerkinElmer Biosystems) according to the manufacturer's instructions. IQSYBR Green Supermix (Bio-Rad) was incubated with a set of specific primers for HsSAD1: 5′-CCA TCA AGA TCG TGA ACC GG-3′ (sense) and 5′-CCT TCA TCA GCA CCG ACT CC-3′ (antisense). The results were analyzed using ABI Primer Sequence Detector Software v1.6.3 (PerkinElmer Biosystems) and normalized by cyclophilin products.Small Interfering RNA (siRNA) Transfection—siRNA duplexes were 21 bp including a 2-deoxynucleotide overhang. The coding strand of hsSAD1 siRNA was 5′-GUU CUU CCG CCA GAU UGU GdTdT-3′. GFP siRNA was used as a control. HeLa S2 cells (2 × 105) were cultured in a 3.5-mm dish for 24 h prior to transfection. Cells were transfected with each siRNA with the use of the Oligofectamine 2000 reagent (Invitrogen). The transfection was done twice with 24-h intervals, and the transfected cells were then treated with UV irradiation at 72 h after the first transfection.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONIdentification of Human SAD1 Kinase—Recent studies of fission yeast have revealed that stress-activated protein kinases influence mitotic control. Of these, Nim1/Cdr1 was identified as a negative regulator of Wee1 protein kinase (35Coleman T.R. Tang Z. Dunphy W.G. Cell. 1993; 72: 919-929Google Scholar, 36Parker L.L. Walter S.A. Young P.G. Piwnica-Worms H. Nature. 1993; 363: 736-738Google Scholar, 37Wu L. Russell P. Nature. 1993; 363: 738-741Google Scholar). Deletion of nim1+ causes defects in response to nutritional deprivation and a cell elongation phenotype that is suppressed by wee1 mutations. Another Nim1 family of serine/threonine kinases, Cdr2, shares homology with Nim1/Cdr1 and modulates phosphorylation of Cdc2 on tyrosine 15 through regulation of Wee1, probably in a manner similar to Nim1/Cdr1 (32Breeding C.S. Hudson J. Balasubramanian M.K. Hemmingsen S.M. Young P.G. Gould K.L. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 3399-3415Google Scholar, 33Kanoh J. Russell P. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 3321-3334Google Scholar). Thus, we speculated that a mammalian homolog of Cdr kinases may regulate stress responses, such as cell cycle arrest, in mammalian cells. To identify cDNAs that encode protein kinases homologous to Cdr kinases, we searched an expressed sequence tag data base using a protein sequence of fission yeast Cdr2. Human and murine expressed sequence tags (human NP003948 and murine XP145303) corresponding to previously unidentified proteins were detected. A full-length cDNA corresponding to the human expressed sequence tag was obtained by conventional screening of a λ phage library of human testis cDNA and then sequenced. The protein encoded by the open reading frame comprises 778 amino acids, with a predicted molecular mass of 87 kDa, and exhibits 44.5% overall sequence identity to S. pombe Cdr2. There are also highly conserved homologs termed SAD1 in C. elegans (34Crump J.G. Zhen M. Jin Y. Bargmann C.I. Neuron. 2001; 29: 115-129Google Scholar) and in the ascidian Halocynthia roretzi, which have overall sequence identities of 52.7 and 59.4%, respectively, and which have been identified as having kinase regulating neuronal polarity. Thus, we have termed this gene human SAD1.Phylogenetic analysis placed human SAD1 and fission yeast Cdr2 in the MARK subfamily of the Snf1/AMPK group (Fig. 1B). Although MARKs do not phosphorylate Cdc25-C at Ser-216 or Cdc25-B at Ser-361 to a comparable extent, C-TAK1 (32% identity to hsSAD1), which is a member of the MARK family of kinases, is involved in the regulation of Cdc25-C function through phosphorylating its Ser-216 residue (38Peng C.Y. Graves P.R. Ogg S. Thoma R.S. Byrnes III, M.J. Wu Z. Stephenson M.T. Piwnica-Worms H. Cell Growth & Differ. 1998; 9: 197-208Google Scholar).The distribution of SAD1 mRNA in various normal human tissues was examined by Northern blot analysis. The SAD1-specific probe recognized a 3.5-kb mRNA that was expressed ubiquitously with the highest levels of expression in the brain and testis. It is noteworthy that the hybridization pattern was somewhat distinct from those observed in MARK1 or MARK2, the levels of expression of which were relatively low in testis (39Drewes G. Ebneth A. Preuss U. Mandelkow E.M. Mandelkow E. Cell. 1997; 89: 297-308Google Scholar). Therefore, the higher expression of hsSAD1 in testis may reflect its physiological function in cell cycle regulation.Northern blot analysis with the hsSAD1 cDNA probe revealed that a hsSAD1 transcript was readily detected at the G1/S boundary and the steady-state level of hsSAD1 mRNA slightly increased as cells approached the M phase and declined during the next G1 phase (data not shown). However, the hsSAD1 protein level detected with a specific antibody was relatively constant throughout the cell cycle (Fig. 1D). hsSAD1 Phosphorylated Wee1 on Ser-642, Cdc25-C on Ser-216, and Cdc25-B on Ser-361 in Vitro—Since fission yeast Cdr2 phosphorylates Wee1, we next determined whether this is also the case with hsSAD1. HsSAD1 protein produced in Sf9 cells phosphorylated the GST-fused human wild-type Wee1A fragment but not its S642A mutant produced in Escherichia coli (Fig. 2). The kinase-dead hsSAD1 mutant (K59A) failed to phosphorylate the wild-type Wee1A fragment. Phosphorylation of Xenopus Wee1 on Ser-549 corresponding to mouse Ser-642 is important for binding of 14-3-3 protein and for maximal activation (40Lee J. Kumagai A. Dunphy W.G. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 551-563Google Scholar). Given that fission yeast Mik1 and Wee1 have been proposed as targets of DNA damage and as DNA replication checkpoints (41O'Connell M.J. Raleigh J.M. Verkade H.M. Nurse P. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 545-554Google Scholar, 42Raleigh J.M. O'Connell M.J. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 1727-1736Google Scholar, 43Rhind N. Russell P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 1499-1508Google Scholar), hsSAD1 phosphorylation of Wee1A on Ser-642 suggests the involvement of this protein at these checkpoint functions. Furthermore, wild-type hsSAD1, but not the kinase-dead mutant, effectively phosphorylated GST-Cdc25-C. HsSAD1 phosphorylated the wild-type GST-Cdc25-C fragment but not the S216A mutant. Wild-type hsSAD1 also phosphorylated the GST-Cdc25-B fragment to the same extent as that of Cdc25-C. HsSAD1 kinase phosphorylated the GST-Cdc25-B S309A mutant as effectively as the wild-type fragment, whereas it failed to phosphorylate GST-Cdc25-B S361A. Thus, hsSAD1 specifically phosphorylates Cdc25-C and Cdc25-B on Ser-216 and Ser-361 in vitro, respectively. Given that phosphorylation of Cdc25-C and -B on Ser-216 and Ser-361 inhibits its phosphatase activity, these results suggested that hsSAD1 may regulate cell cycle arrest upon DNA damage or DNA replication blockage through two independent mechanisms: inhibition of Cdc25-C and -B and activation of Wee1A. Notably, the Ser-642 of Wee1A, Ser-216 of Cdc25-C, and Ser-361 of Cdc25-B have also been found to act as substrates of Chk1 (16Kaneko Y.S. Watanabe N. Morisaki H. Akita H. Fujimoto A. Tominaga K. Terasawa M. Tachibana A. Ikeda K. Nakanishi M. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 3673-3681Google Scholar), suggesting that their functions overlap at several cell cycle checkpoints.Fig. 2HsSAD1 specifically phosphorylates GST-Wee1A, GST-Cdc25-C, and GST-Cdc25-B on Ser-642, Ser-216, and Ser-361, respectively. Wild-type (wt) and kinase-dead mutant (kd) Myc-hsSAD1 were purified from Sf9 cells, and each was assayed for its ability to phosphorylate purified GST-fused wild-type or mutant Wee1A, Cdc25-C, or Cdc25-B fragments as indicated on the top (Kinase activity; upper panel). The amount of substrate was confirmed by Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining (CBB staining; lower panel). The amount of wild-type and kinase-dead mutant Myc-hsSAD1 proteins was also determined by immunoprecipitation (IP)-immunoblotting analysis using α-Myc antibody (bottom panel). FL, full-length.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Overexpression of hsSAD1 Enhanced the Phosphorylation of Cdc25C on Ser-216 in Vivo—We examined whether hsSAD1 could phosphorylate Cdc25C on Ser-216 in vivo. HeLa cells were transfected with either wild-type hsSAD1 or kinase-dead mutant (K59A), and the phosphorylation of endogenous Cdc25C on Ser-216 was determined by the immunoblotting using antibodies specific to phospho-Cdc25C on Ser-216. The phosphorylated form of Cdc25C on Ser-216 was significantly increased in wild-type hsSAD1 transfected cells. The Cdc25C protein levels were constant in wild-type, kinase-dead, and control vector transfected cells (Fig. 3). Thus, these results suggested that hsSAD1 could phosphorylate Cdc25C on Ser-216 in vivo.Fig. 3Overexpression of hsSAD1 enhances phosphorylation of Cdc25C on Ser-216 in vivo. Asynchronous HeLaS2 cells were transfected with wild-type (WT) hsSAD1, kinase-dead (KD) mutant, or vector alone. Forty-eight hours after transfection, cells were harvested, and cell lysates were subjected to immunoblotting using antibodies specific to Cdc25C, phospho-Cdc25C on Ser-216 (P-S216), or hsSAD1.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)UV-induced, but Not IR-induced, DNA Damage Activates hsSAD1—We next determined the effect of DNA damage on hsSAD1 kinase activity. A172 glioma cells were treated with x-ray, UV, MMS, or hydroxyurea, and the endogenous hsSAD1 was assayed for its kinase activity using the GST-Cdc25-C fragment as a substrate. The kinase activity in the anti-hsSAD1 immunoprecipitates increased ∼5-fold at 10 min after UV irradiation or MMS treatment but not after x-ray irradiation or hydroxyurea treatment, although the hsSAD1 protein level was not affected by these treatments (Fig. 4A). The induction was apparent as early as 10 min after treatment, and the level remained constant for up to 120 min. The kinase activity was not detected when the Cdc25-C mutant (S216A) was used as a substrate (data not shown). Thus, these results suggested that kinase activation of hsSAD1 occurs at the DNA damage checkpoint upon UV or MMS treatment.Fig. 4Activation of hsSAD1 in response to DNA damage induced by UV or MMS, but not by IR, is caffeine-sensitive. A, asynchronous A172 cells were treated with UV (70 J/m2), MMS (50 μg/ml), x-ray (10 grays), or hydroxyurea (HU, 5 mm) and harvested at the indicated intervals. The cell lysates were then immunoprecipitated with anti-hsSAD1 antibody (α-HsSAD1) or normal rabbit IgG (control), and the resultant precipitates were subjected to kinase assay using the GST-Cdc25-C fragment as a substrate. The cell lysates were also subjected to immunoblotting using anti-hsSAD1 antibody. B, asynchronous A172 cells were treated with 10 mm caffeine for 2 h before treatment with UV.

https://openalex.org/W2047445903,"Residues responsible for phosphate binding in F1F0-ATP synthase catalytic sites are of significant interest because phosphate binding is believed linked to proton gradient-driven subunit rotation. From x-ray structures, a phosphate-binding subdomain is evident in catalytic sites, with conserved βArg-246 in a suitable position to bind phosphate. Mutations βR246Q, βR246K, and βR246A in Escherichia coli were found to impair oxidative phosphorylation and to reduce ATPase activity of purified F1 by 100-fold. In contrast to wild type, ATPase of mutants was not inhibited by MgADP-fluoroaluminate or MgADP-fluoroscandium, showing the Arg side chain is required for wild-type transition state formation. Whereas 7-chloro-4-nitrobenzo-2-oxa-1,3-diazole (NBD-Cl) inhibited wild-type ATPase essentially completely, ATPase in mutants was inhibited maximally by ∼50%, although reaction still occurred at residue βTyr-297, proximal to βArg-246 in the phosphate-binding pocket. Inhibition characteristics supported the conclusion that NBD-Cl reacts in βE (empty) catalytic sites, as shown previously by x-ray structure analysis. Phosphate protected against NBD-Cl inhibition in wild type but not in mutants. The results show that phosphate can bind in the βE catalytic site of E. coli F1 and that βArg-246 is an important phosphate-binding residue.

ATP synthesis from ADP and Pi in oxidative and photophosphorylation occurs in the catalytic sites of F1F0-ATP synthase. This membrane enzyme uses the energy of an ion gradient (usually protons) to drive rotation of a “rotor” composed of subunits γϵcn (where n can vary from 10 to 14 in different organisms), the rotor serving as a transmission device which upon rotation drives the chemical synthesis of ATP sequentially at three catalytic sites. Catalytic sites are located at α/β interfaces of the α3β3 subunit hexagon, which are immobilized during rotation by the “stator,” consisting of subunits δb2. The proton motor is composed of the single a and a ring of c subunits. Experimental work in this system has been greatly facilitated by the ability to separate the water-soluble F1 sector (subunits α3β3γδϵ) from the membrane-embedded F0 sector (subunits ab2cring), with retention of ATP hydrolysis function in the former and of proton conduction in the latter.

FASEB J. 1989; 3: 2164-2178Google Scholar) hypothesized that the affinity of catalytic sites for Pi is increased by the proton gradient, and currently the concept that Pi binding is enhanced by proton gradient-driven subunit rotation appears well supported. Significant Pi binding to Escherichia coli F1 catalytic sites was not measurable by direct binding assay using radioactive Pi (7Al-Shawi M.K. Senior A.E. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 886-891Google Scholar). The Kd value for Pi binding was >10 mm as measured by competition with Mg-AMPPNP or ATP in fluorescence titrations using the βY331W mutant enzyme (8Weber J. Wilke-Mounts S. Lee R.S.F. Grell E. Senior A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20126-20133Google Scholar, 9Löbau S. Weber J. Senior A.E. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 10846-10853Google Scholar, 10Weber J. Senior A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12653-12658Google Scholar). Calculations based on unisite catalysis kinetics showed that KdPi in unisite catalysis is 2.3 × 103m in E. coli and 87 m in mitochondrial F1 (11Al-Shawi M.K. Parsonage D. Senior A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 15376-15383Google Scholar). Although not directly applicable to physiological catalysis (2Senior A.E. Nadanaciva S. Weber J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1553: 188-211Google Scholar), such calculations underline the weak affinity that the catalytic site of highest affinity for ATP has for Pi in the absence of proton-driven rotation. On the other hand, measurements of KmPi for ATP synthesis are in the range of ∼1 mm (12Wise J.G. Senior A.E. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 6949-6954Google Scholar, 13Al-Shawi M.K. Ketchum C.J.

An important conclusion is that Pi binding and release steps are likely to be intimately linked to rotational movements of subunits (1Weber J. Senior A.E. FEBS Lett. 2003; 545: 61-70Google Scholar, 2Senior A.E. Nadanaciva S. Weber J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1553: 188-211Google Scholar, 15Masaike T. Muneyuki E. Noji H. Kinosita K. Yoshida M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 21643-21649Google Scholar).An often overlooked but crucial question in the mechanism of ATP synthesis is, how does the enzyme bind ADP plus Pi and not ATP into catalytic sites? In active cells the cytoplasmic concentrations of ATP and Pi are approximately in the 2–5 mm range, whereas that of ADP is at least 10–50-fold lower. Equilibrium binding assays have established that both ADP and ATP bind to catalytic sites of purified F1 and detergent-solubilized F1F0 with relatively similar binding affinities (8Weber J. Wilke-Mounts S. Lee R.S.F. Grell E. Senior A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20126-20133Google Scholar, 9Löbau S. Weber J. Senior A.E. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 10846-10853Google Scholar, 16Weber J. Hammond S.T. Wilke-Mounts S. Senior A.E. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 608-614Google Scholar, 17Dou C. Fortes P.A.G. Allison W.S. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 16757-16764Google Scholar). Obviously, the enzyme must have evolved a specific mechanism for selectively binding ADP into catalytic sites while contemporaneously discouraging access of ATP during proton-driven rotation and ATP synthesis. One hypothesis is that during ATP synthesis, proton gradient-driven rotation of subunits drives an empty catalytic site to bind Pi tightly, thus stereochemically precluding ATP binding and therefore selectively favoring ADP binding (18Weber J. Senior A.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1458: 300-309Google Scholar). Further understanding of features that determine Pi binding is therefore of major importance in formulating a mechanism for ATP synthesis. So far, none of the residues directly involved in binding Pi has been identified experimentally.X-ray structural analysis has indicated the possible location of the Pi binding subdomain in the catalytic sites. A residue within this subdomain that could be significantly involved in Pi binding is βArg-246 1E. coli residue numbers used throughout. 1E. coli residue numbers used throughout. (equivalent to βArg-260 in mitochondrial F1), conserved in all known species. Fig. 1A shows (ADP·AlF4−)bound in the βDP catalytic site (19Menz R.I. Walker J.E. Leslie A.G.W. Cell. 2001; 106: 331-341Google Scholar) in what is believed to be a transition state analog structure. Fig. 1B shows the βDP site with ADP and AlF3 bound in what is believed to be a late transition state or early ground state structure (20Braig K. Menz R.I. Montgomery M.G. Leslie A.G.W. Walker J.E. Structure (Lond.). 2000; 8: 567-573Google Scholar), and Fig. 1C shows the βADP + Pi site (also called the “half-closed” or βHC site) in what is believed to be a post-hydrolysis state (19Menz R.I. Walker J.E. Leslie A.G.W. Cell. 2001; 106: 331-341Google Scholar). In this latter site, an (SO42−)ion is present which is thought to mimic phosphate, whereas in Fig. 1, A and B, fluoroaluminate is in the position of the phosphate. In Fig. 1, A–C, residue βArg-246 lies close to the phosphate moiety, at the end of what appears to be a phosphate-binding pocket also demarcated by residue βTyr-297. The distance between the phosphate moiety and βArg-246 changes decrementally as the transition state collapses to the post-hydrolysis state. Moreover Fig. 1, A–C, suggests experimental approaches to determine whether βArg-246 is an important determinant of Pi binding, namely the use of surrogates for Pi or the γ-P of ATP, such as fluoroaluminate, fluoroscandium, and fluoroberyllate, or the use of NBD-Cl 2The abbreviations used are: NBD-Cl, 7-chloro-4-nitrobenzo-2-oxa-1,3-diazole; DTT, dithiothreitol; AMPPNP, adenosine 5′-(β,γ-imino)-triphosphate. 2The abbreviations used are: NBD-Cl, 7-chloro-4-nitrobenzo-2-oxa-1,3-diazole; DTT, dithiothreitol; AMPPNP, adenosine 5′-(β,γ-imino)-triphosphate. which reacts specifically with residue βTyr-297, located at the end of the Pi binding subdomain (Fig. 1D).Early random mutagenesis experiments revealed that mutations βR246H and βR246C impaired oxidative phosphorylation drastically and reduced ATPase activity in purified F1 to ∼1% of wild type (21Noumi T. Taniai M. Kanazawa H. Futai M. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 9196-9201Google Scholar, 22Parsonage D. Duncan T.M. Wilke-Mounts S. Kironde F.A.S. Hatch L. Senior A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 6301-6307Google Scholar). Later work showed that unisite catalysis parameter KdPi was changed by 4 orders of magnitude, whereas KdADP was largely unaltered by βR246C, and the ATP hydrolysis reaction equilibrium constant changed to favor ATP over ADP plus Pi (11Al-Shawi M.K. Parsonage D. Senior A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 15376-15383Google Scholar). Recent computer simulations have drawn attention to βArg-246. Movement of the residue during rotation, change of the conformation of the sites (23Bockmann R.A. Grubmuller H. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2002; 9: 198-202Google Scholar), and a role in liganding Pi and the transition state were predicted (24Yang W. Gao Y.Q. Cui Q. Ma J. Karplus M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 874-879Google Scholar, 25Dittrich M. Hayashi S. Schulten K. Biophys. J. 2003; 85: 2253-2266Google Scholar).The goal of this paper was to determine experimentally whether residue βArg-246 does in fact contribute to Pi binding in ATP synthase catalytic sites. We used site-directed mutagenesis to substitute Gln, Lys, and Ala for residue βArg-246, and we have examined the effects of each mutation on function. A variety of inhibitors and ligands known to bind or react in the catalytic sites close to the Pi-binding subdomain was utilized in combination with the mutant enzymes to establish the role of the βArg-246 side chain.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESPreparation of E. coli Membranes; Purification of F1; Measurement of Growth Yield in Limiting Glucose Medium; Assay of ATPase Activity of Membranes or Purified F1—E. coli membranes were prepared as described previously (26Senior A.E. Langman L. Cox G.B. Gibson F. Biochem. J. 1983; 210: 395-403Google Scholar). Prior to the experiments, membranes were washed twice by resuspension and ultracentrifugation in 50 mm TrisSO4, pH 8.0, 2.5 mm MgSO4. F1 was purified as in Ref. 27Weber J. Lee R.S.F. Grell E. Wise J.G. Senior A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 1712-1718Google Scholar. Prior to the experiments, F1 samples (100 μl) were passed twice through 1-ml centrifuge columns (Sephadex G-50) equilibrated in 50 mm TrisSO4, pH 8.0, to remove catalytic site-bound nucleotide. Growth yield in limiting glucose was measured as described previously (28Senior A.E. Latchney L.R. Ferguson A.M. Wise J.G. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1984; 228: 49-53Google Scholar). ATPase activity was measured in 1 ml of assay buffer containing 10 mm NaATP, 4 mm MgCl2, 50 mm TrisSO4, pH 8.5. Specific activity was measured at 30 °C, and measurements of inhibition by inhibitors were done at room temperature. Reactions were started by addition of enzyme and stopped by addition of SDS to 3.3% final concentration. Pi released was assayed as described previously (29Taussky H.H. Shorr E. J. Biol. Chem. 1953; 202: 675-685Google Scholar). For wild-type membranes and F1, reaction times were 2–10 min. For mutant enzymes reaction times were 30–120 min. All reactions were shown to be linear with time and protein concentration.E. coli Strains—For purified F1, wild-type strain SWM1 was used (30Rao R. Al-Shawi M.K. Senior A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 5569-5573Google Scholar), and for membranes wild type was pBWU13.4/DK8 (31Ketchum C.J. Al-Shawi M.K. Nakamoto R.K. Biochem. J. 1998; 330: 707-712Google Scholar). For fluorescence titrations with purified F1 strain SWM4 (βY331W) (8Weber J. Wilke-Mounts S. Lee R.S.F. Grell E. Senior A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20126-20133Google Scholar) was used as the “wild type.” Mutant strains were βR246Q/βY331W, βR246K/βY331W, and βR246A/βY331W, all three in DK8 and constructed as indicated below.Construction of Mutant Strains of E. coli—pSN6 is a plasmid containing the βY331W mutation from plasmid pSWM4 (8Weber J. Wilke-Mounts S. Lee R.S.F. Grell E. Senior A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20126-20133Google Scholar) introduced on a SacI-EagI fragment into pBWU13.4 (31Ketchum C.J. Al-Shawi M.K. Nakamoto R.K. Biochem. J. 1998; 330: 707-712Google Scholar) which expresses all the ATP synthase genes. The template for oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis was M13mp18 containing the HindIII-XbaI fragment from pSN6. Mutagenesis was by the method of Vandeyar et al. (32Vandeyar M. Weiner M. Hutton C. Batt C. Gene (Amst.). 1988; 65: 129-133Google Scholar). Mutagenic oligonucleotides were as follows: for βR246Q, GACAACATCTATCAGTATACCCTGGCCGG, where the underlined bases introduce the mutation and a new BstI107I restriction site; for βR246K, GACAACATCTATAAGTATACCCTGGCCGG, where the underlined bases introduce the mutation and a new BstI107I restriction site; and for βR246A, GACAACATCTATGCATACACCCTGGC, where the underlined bases introduce the mutation site and a new NsiI restriction site. DNA sequencing was performed to confirm the presence of mutations and absence of undesired changes in sequence, and the mutations were transferred to pSN6 on SacI-EagI fragments, generating the new plasmids pZA5 (βR246Q/βY331W), pZA6 (βR246K/βY331W), and pZA7 (βR246A/βY331W), respectively. Each plasmid was transformed into strain DK8 (33Klionsky D.J. Brusilow W.S.A. Simoni R.D. J. Bacteriol. 1984; 160: 1055-1060Google Scholar) containing a deletion of ATP synthase genes for expression of the mutant enzymes.Fluorescence Titrations—The method utilizes the quench of fluorescence of introduced residue βTrp-331 that occurs upon nucleotide binding to catalytic sites (34Weber J. Senior A.E. Methods Enzymol. 2004; 380: 132-152Google Scholar). Titration with MgADP and MgATP was carried out in 50 mm TrisSO4, pH 8.0, 2.5 mm MgSO4 at room temperature. NaADP and NaATP were added incrementally. Excitation was at 295 nm, and emission was at 360 nm in a SPEX Fluorolog 2 spectrofluorometer. Final enzyme concentration in the cuvette was 150–200 nm, and enzyme was incubated for 10 min at room temperature before titration was begun. Background signals due to buffer were subtracted, and volume and inner filter effects were corrected by carrying out parallel titrations with wild-type F1. Calculation of nucleotide binding parameters was accomplished by fitting theoretical curves to the measured data points assuming models with three types of binding sites (34Weber J. Senior A.E. Methods Enzymol. 2004; 380: 132-152Google Scholar, 35Lobau S. Weber J. Wilke-Mounts S. Senior A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3648-3656Google Scholar).Inhibition of ATPase Activity—For fluoroaluminate, fluoroscandium, fluoroberyllate, and vanadate inhibition, F1 was incubated for 60 min at room temperature in 50 mm TrisSO4, 2.5 mm MgSO4, 1 mm NaADP, and 10 mm NaF at a protein concentration of 0.2–1.0 mg/ml in presence of AlCl3, ScCl3, or BaSO4, added at varied concentrations (see “Results”). 100-μl aliquots were then added to 1 ml of ATPase assay buffer, and activity was measured as above. It was confirmed in control experiments that no inhibition was seen if MgSO4, NaADP, or NaF was omitted. NaF was absent when vanadate was the inhibitor, and sodium orthovanadate was pretreated as described (36Goodno C.C. Methods Enzymol. 1982; 85: 116-123Google Scholar). For NBD-Cl inhibition of purified F1, NBD-Cl was prepared as a stock solution in dimethyl sulfoxide and protected from light. Enzyme (0.2–0.4 mg/ml) was reacted with NBD-Cl for 60 min in the dark, at room temperature, in 50 mm TrisSO4, pH 8.0, 2.5 mm MgSO4, and then 100-μl aliquots were transferred to 1 ml of ATPase assay buffer to determine activity. For NBD-Cl inhibition of F1F0 in membranes, protein concentration was 0.7–1.0 mg/ml in 50-μl aliquots; the other conditions were the same. Where protection from NBD-Cl inhibition by ADP or Pi was determined, F1 and membranes were preincubated for 60 min with protecting agent before addition of NBD-Cl. MgSO4 was present, equimolar with ADP or Pi. Control samples containing the ligand without added NBD-Cl were included. Neither Pi (up to 50 mm) nor MgADP (up to 10 mm) had any inhibitory effect alone. For measurement of azide inhibition, sodium azide at varied concentrations was added directly to the ATPase assay buffer, to which F1 was added to start the reaction.RESULTSProperties of βR246Q, βR246K, and βR246A Mutants of E. coli ATP Synthase—Residue βArg-246 was changed to Gln, Lys, or Ala by oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis, and then the mutant ATP synthase complex was expressed from a plasmid in a strain of E. coli (DK8) containing a deletion of the ATP synthase genes. It should be noted that the additional mutation βY331W was also present in all three cases, to allow monitoring of nucleotide binding affinity and stoichiometry in purified F1 by fluorescence titration. Effects of the βArg-246 mutations on oxidative phosphorylation in vivo were assayed by growth on succinate-containing plates and in limiting glucose medium. All three mutations prevented growth on succinate. Growth yields on limiting glucose were reduced close to the ATP synthase null control (Table I). Therefore, all three mutations seriously impaired ATP synthesis in vivo. The βY331W mutation alone has little effect on growth.Table IEffects of βArg-246 mutations on cell growth and F1-ATPase activityMutationaWild-type, pBWU13.4/DK8; Null, pUC118/DK8.

All three βArg-246 mutants were expressed with the βY331W mutation also present. Open table in a new tab F1 was purified from each mutant, and yields were similar to that with wild-type enzyme. On SDS gels, the enzymes appeared pure and showed the same subunit composition as in wild type. Analysis of Trp content by measurement of fluorescence in 6 m guanidine hydrochloride (λexc = 295 nm, λem = 360 nm) confirmed that the purity of the mutant enzymes was the same as wild type, with the expected 12 Trp/mol. Specific ATPase activities for the mutant enzymes are given in Table I. The ATPase activity was around 1% of wild type in all three mutant enzymes. Similar activity had been seen earlier in βR246H and βR246C enzymes (21Noumi T. Taniai M. Kanazawa H. Futai M. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 9196-9201Google Scholar, 22Parsonage D. Duncan T.M. Wilke-Mounts S. Kironde F.A.S. Hatch L. Senior A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 6301-6307Google Scholar). Retention of the positive charge in the βR246K mutant did not therefore affect the outcome of mutagenesis, at least as far as ATPase activity in vitro or ATP synthesis in vivo were concerned.Ability of the Mutant F1 to Bind MgATP and MgADP— Fluorescence of introduced residue βTrp-331 was used to measure MgATP binding characteristics (8Weber J. Wilke-Mounts S. Lee R.S.F. Grell E. Senior A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20126-20133Google Scholar, 34Weber J. Senior A.E. Methods Enzymol. 2004; 380: 132-152Google Scholar). Titrations of the purified mutant F1 enzymes with the nucleotides were carried out (data not shown), and Kd values for binding at each of the three catalytic sites, calculated as described under “Experimental Procedures,” are listed in Table II. The mutations caused reduction of affinity for MgATP, most noticeably at site two (the site of “medium” affinity) and at site one (highest affinity) with little effect at site three (lowest affinity). Most interesting, the mutation that might have been predicted to have the smallest effect, namely βR246K, in fact had the largest effect. With MgADP there was again loss of affinity at sites one and two, with lesser effects at site three, and the βR246K mutant had the largest effect. It appears, however, that the large effects of the mutations on ATP synthesis and ATPase activity are not commensurately reflected in impairment of substrate ADP or ATP binding affinities. At saturation (1 mm of MgADP or MgATP) all three mutant enzymes would contain all three sites filled, as in wild type.Table IIMgATP and MgADP binding parameters of mutant enzymes Kd values are given in μm.βY331WaValues were taken from Ref. 34.

Chem. 1998; 274: 7052-7058Google Scholar), and experiments showed that MgADP-fluoroaluminate formed a tenaciously bound inhibitory complex with F1 that mimicked a transition state (38Nadanaciva S.

Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 15493-15499Google Scholar). X-ray crystallography subsequently deduced the structure of mitochondrial F1 with both ADP·AlF3 and (ADP·AlF4−)species bound (19Menz R.I. Walker J.E. Leslie A.G.W. Cell. 2001; 106: 331-341Google Scholar, 20Braig K. Menz R.I. Montgomery M.G. Leslie A.G.W. Walker J.E. Structure (Lond.). 2000; 8: 567-573Google Scholar). Fig. 2A shows that the mutations βR246Q, βR246K, or βR246A all rendered E. coli F1 insensitive to ADP·fluoroaluminate inhibition. Since the concentration of MgADP in these experiments (1 mm) was easily sufficient to saturate the enzyme catalytic sites (Table II), our conclusion is that substitution of βArg-246 greatly weakens interaction with the fluoroaluminate moiety. Notably, even the Lys mutant was unable to substitute for Arg.Fig. 2Inhibition of purified F1 from mutant and wild-type enzymes by fluoroaluminate and fluoroscandium.

Weber J. Senior A.E. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 9583-9590Google Scholar) by mimicking a transition state. Fig. 2B shows that the mutants βR246Q, βR246K, and βR246A were all completely immune to ADP-fluoroscandium inhibition, again suggesting that βArg-246 in wild type is normally important in liganding the fluoroscandium moiety and bringing about inhibition.MgADP·vanadate complex is an inhibitory transition state analog that has been used to study a variety of ATPase enzymes. Because the vanadate moiety is pentacovalent in the inhibited enzyme complex (e.g. Ref. 42Smith C.A. Rayment I. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 5404-5417Google Scholar), ADP-vanadate is thought to provide a close mimic of a true transition state of a natural transphosphorylation reaction (43Lahiri S.D. Zhang G. Dunaway-Mariano D. Allen K.N. Science. 2003; 299: 2067-2071Google Scholar). Unfortunately, both wild-type and mutant E. coli F1 proved to be resistant to inhibition by vanadate (up to 2.4 mm) in combination with 1 mm MgADP (data not shown).The MgADP·fluoroberyllate complex is different from the preceding inhibitors in that the bound complex mimics a ground state with ATP bound (e.g. Ref. 44Fisher A.J. Smith C.A. Thoden J.B. Smith R. Sutoh K. Holden H.M. Rayment I. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 8960-8972Google Scholar). MgADP·fluoroberyllate is a potent inhibitor of wild-type E. coli F1 as shown in Fig. 3. Here a varied pattern of inhibition was seen with the mutant enzymes. βR246K was inhibited to the same extent as wild type (∼90%); βR246A was inhibited by ∼45% and βR246Q by ∼30%. Thus, substitution of Arg impaired liganding to the fluoroberyllate moiety in Ala and Gln mutants but not with Lys.Fig. 3Inhibition of purified F1 from mutant and wild-type enzymes by fluoroberyllate. Inhibition of ATPase after preincubation for 60 min with 1 mm MgADP, 10 mm NaF, and varied BeSO4. ○, wild type; •, βR246Q/βY331W; ▪, βR246K/βY331W; ▴, βR246A/βY331W.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)To summarize, the results show that residue βArg-246 is critical for liganding the phosphate moiety of ATP in the transition state and that it also plays a role in binding the γ-P in the MgADP·fluoroberyllate complex. Lys can substitute in the latter situation but not in the former.Inhibition of ATPase Activity of F1 by Azide—Azide is a potent inhibitor of F1-ATPases in general, although its mode of inhibition remains controversial (45Weber J. Senior A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33210-33215Google Scholar). It has not yet been located in x-ray structures of F1. One school of thought envisages that azide might form a tightly bound MgADP·N–3 complex at catalytic site(s) (46Dou C. Grodsky N.B. Matsui T. Yoshida M. Allison W.S. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 3719-3727Google Scholar). However, data in Ref. 45Weber J. Senior A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33210-33215Google Scholar led to the conclusion that azide blocks conformational signal transmission between catalytic sites. Fig. 4 shows that the mutant βR246Q, βR246K, and βR246A enzymes were all remarkably resistant to inhibition by sodium azide (note that βY331W F1 is strongly inhibited by azide, see Ref. 45Weber J. Senior A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33210-33215Google Scholar).Fig. 4Inhibition of purified F1 from mutant and wild-type enzymes by azide.

Fig. 1D shows x-ray structure analysis of the empty catalytic site (βE) containing the covalent NBD-O-tyrosyl adduct (47Orriss G.L. Leslie A.G.W. Braig K. Walker J.E. Structure (Lond.). 1998; 6: 831-837Google Scholar). Our interest in NBD-Cl inhibition was piqued not only because residue βTyr-297 is close to βArg-246 and to the Pi moiety in catalytic sites but also because Perez et al. (48Perez J.A. Greenfield A.J. Sutton R. Ferguson S.J. FEBS Lett. 1986; 198: 113-118Google Scholar) had reported that Pi protects against NBD-Cl inhibition of F1F0"

Their secretion mechanism comprises entry to the periplasm via the Sec apparatus, followed by formation of an outer membrane β barrel, which allows the N-terminal passenger domain to pass to the extracellular space. Several groups have identified a region immediately upstream of the β domain that is important for outer membrane translocation, the so-called linker region. Here we characterize this region in EspP, a prototype of the serine protease autotransporters of enterobacteriaceae. We hypothesized that the folding of this region would be important in the outer membrane translocation process. We tested this hypothesis using a mutagenesis approach in conjunction with a series of nested deletions and found that in the absence of a complete passenger, mutations to the C-terminal helix, but not the upstream linker, significantly decrease secretion efficiency. However, in the presence of the passenger mutations to the amino-terminal region of the linker decrease secretion efficiency. Moreover, amino acids of hydrophobic character play a crucial role in linker function, suggesting the existence of a hydrophobic core or hydrophobic interaction necessary for outer membrane translocation of autotransporter proteins.

The rapid progress in genomics and widespread availability of genetic information has led to a greater appreciation of the importance of autotransporter proteins. By definition, autotransporters carry all necessary components for translocation through the Gram-negative periplasm and outer membrane within a single protein (1Jose J. Jahnig F. Meyer T.F. Mol.

Inner membrane transit is mediated by a signal sequence, which targets the protein through the Sec apparatus into the periplasmic space (5Brandon L.D. Goehring N. Janakiraman A. Yan A.W. Wu T. Beckwith J. Goldberg M.B. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 50: 45-60Google Scholar). The C terminus then creates a β barrel in the outer membrane that either as a monomer (2Henderson I.R. Navarro-Garcia F.

Nikaido H. de Lorenzo V. Fernandez L.A. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 2122-2131Google Scholar), forms an outer membrane pore. The N-terminal passenger domain is thought to traverse this pore, which is estimated by black lipid bilayers (for BrkA (10Shannon J.L. Fernandez R.C. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 5838-5842Google Scholar)) and liposome swelling assays (for IgA protease (9Veiga E. Sugawara E. Nikaido H. de Lorenzo V. Fernandez L.A.

Otzelberger K. Pohlner J. Meyer T.F. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 234: 579-593Google Scholar). However, pore formation in planar lipid bilayers and the crystal structure of NalP suggest a diameter between 8.4 and 10 Å (6Oomen C.J. Van Ulsen P. Van Gelder P. Feijen M. Tommassen J. Gros P. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 1257-1266Google Scholar). Remarkably, a passenger domain over 100 kDa in size can translocate through the outer membrane into the extracellular space utilizing this pore. Recently, however, Oomen et al. (6Oomen C.J. Van Ulsen P. Van Gelder P. Feijen M. Tommassen J. Gros P. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 1257-1266Google Scholar) have suggested that an accessory protein in the outer membrane may aid the translocation process, perhaps acting with the β pore (6Oomen C.J. Van Ulsen P. Van Gelder P. Feijen M. Tommassen J. Gros P. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 1257-1266Google Scholar, 12Voulhoux R. Bos M.P. Geurtsen J. Mols M. Tommassen J. Science. 2003; 299: 262-265Google Scholar). In either case, proper barrel insertion into the outer membrane appears to be crucial, but events taking place in the periplasm and at the outer membrane remain obscure.Several laboratories have shown that in various autotransporters (namely BrkA (13Oliver D.C. Huang G. Fernandez R.C. J. Bacteriol. 2003; 185: 489-495Google Scholar, 14Oliver D.C. Huang G. Nodel E. Pleasance S. Fernandez R.C. Mol.

Schmidt M.A. Antonie Leeuwenhoek. 2001; 80: 19-34Google Scholar)), a region immediately upstream of the β domain is important for the secretion process. Sequential deletions in this region, termed by some the linker domain, result in a diminution of translocation efficiency of either a heterologous epitope (16Maurer J. Jose J. Meyer T.F. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 7014-7020Google Scholar, 17Maurer J. Jose J. Meyer T.F. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 794-804Google Scholar) or a portion of the natural autotransporter passenger domain (13Oliver D.C. Huang G. Fernandez R.C. J. Bacteriol. 2003; 185: 489-495Google Scholar). This linker, along with the β domain, has been termed the translocation unit (16Maurer J. Jose J. Meyer T.F. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 7014-7020Google Scholar). The exact contribution of the linker domain is still under investigation, and importantly, few studies have addressed secretion of native passengers. The C-terminal portion closest to the β domain was shown for NalP to be helical and to interact with residues extending into the hydrophilic pore of the β domain (6Oomen C.J. Van Ulsen P. Van Gelder P. Feijen M. Tommassen J. Gros P. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 1257-1266Google Scholar). The same secondary structure has been strongly predicted for the majority of autotransporters (2Henderson I.R. Navarro-Garcia F. Nataro J.P. Trends Microbiol. 1998; 6: 370-378Google Scholar, 19Suzuki T. Lett M.C. Sasakawa C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30874-30880Google Scholar, 20Hendrixson D.R. de la Morena M.L. Stathopoulos C. St. Geme III, J.W. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 26: 505-518Google Scholar). In addition to translocation, Konieczny et al. (18Konieczny M.P.J. Benz I. Hollinderbaumer B. Beinke C. Niederweis M. Schmidt M.A. Antonie Leeuwenhoek. 2001; 80: 19-34Google Scholar) have suggested that the linker may have a role in stabilization of the β domain in the outer membrane. Other groups studying BrkA from Bordetella pertussis (14Oliver D.C. Huang G. Nodel E. Pleasance S. Fernandez R.C. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 47: 1367-1383Google Scholar) and Ssp from Serratia marcescens (15Ohnishi Y. Nishiyama M. Horinouchi S. Beppu T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32800-32806Google Scholar) have suggested that the more N-terminal region of the linker, upstream of the putative α-helix, may function as an autochaperone. This function could be important for the autotransporter to fold into its proper conformation in the extracellular space and to confer resistance to outer membrane proteases. Oliver et al. (14Oliver D.C. Huang G. Nodel E. Pleasance S. Fernandez R.C. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 47: 1367-1383Google Scholar) suggest that the chaperone function is widespread among autotransporters based on in silico homologies, although it has been shown experimentally only for BrkA and Ssp (14Oliver D.C. Huang G. Nodel E. Pleasance S. Fernandez R.C. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 47: 1367-1383Google Scholar, 15Ohnishi Y. Nishiyama M. Horinouchi S. Beppu T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32800-32806Google Scholar).Recognizing the critical importance of and uncertainty regarding the autotransporter linker domain, we here define the linker region of the autotransporter EspP and characterize its properties as they relate to outer membrane translocation. EspP is a member of the serine protease autotransporters of enterobacteriaceae (SPATE) 1The abbreviations used are: SPATE, serine protease autotransporters of enterobacteriaceae; MHT, epitope containing the Myc epitope, His epitope, and TEV protease recognition sequence; MBP, maltose-binding protein. 1The abbreviations used are: SPATE, serine protease autotransporters of enterobacteriaceae; MHT, epitope containing the Myc epitope, His epitope, and TEV protease recognition sequence; MBP, maltose-binding protein. subfamily of autotransporters (2Henderson I.R. Navarro-Garcia F. Nataro J.P. Trends Microbiol. 1998; 6: 370-378Google Scholar). After translocation, it is cleaved away from its β domain between residues 1023 and 1024 and secreted from enterohemorrhagic E. coli as a 104-kDa mature toxin (21Brunder W. Schmidt H. Karch H. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 24: 767-778Google Scholar, 22Djafari S. Ebel F. Deibel C. Kramer S. Hudel M. Chakraborty T. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 25: 771-784Google Scholar). Although its in vivo target and mechanism of action are unknown, it has been shown to cleave coagulation factor V in vitro (21Brunder W. Schmidt H. Karch H. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 24: 767-778Google Scholar). It has significant overall homology and shares an active serine protease motif with other members of the SPATE subfamily of autotransporters (2Henderson I.R. Navarro-Garcia F. Nataro J.P. Trends Microbiol. 1998; 6: 370-378Google Scholar). We employed a mutagenesis approach to first define a putative linker domain for EspP; we then investigated the nature of its primary and secondary structures crucial to translocation. We found that EspP has a linker domain similar to other autotransporters. The putative C-terminal α-helix appears to play an important role in secretion of a small epitope in the absence of the passenger domain. In the presence of the complete toxin, however, mutations in the N-terminal region of the linker affect secretion. In addition, mutations to hydrophobic residues have the greatest effect on translocation efficiency, suggesting the existence of a hydrophobic core or hydrophobic interaction that is vital to the EspP outer membrane translocation process.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESBacterial Strains—All genetic manipulations were first transformed into E. coli DH5α (23Hanahan D. J. Mol. Biol. 1983; 166: 557-580Google Scholar) and then into HB101 (24Boyer H.W. Roulland-Dussoix D. J. Mol. Biol. 1969; 41: 459-472Google Scholar) once proper construction was confirmed. Secretion analyses were performed, unless otherwise noted, in HB101. UT5600(OmpT–) (25Elish M.E. Pierce J.R. Earhart C.F. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1988; 134: 1355-1364Google Scholar) cells were obtained from New England Biolabs and used for secretion analysis and localization of nonsecreted mutants as indicated below.Linker Deletions and Site-directed Mutagenesis—Molecular biology techniques were performed according to standard protocols (26Sambrook J. Russell D.W. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 3rd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2001Google Scholar) on plasmid PB9-5 (21Brunder W. Schmidt H. Karch H. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 24: 767-778Google Scholar), which contains the espP gene with its natural promoter in vector pK18 (27Pridmore R.D. Gene (Amst.). 1987; 56: 309-312Google Scholar). Oligonucleotides used for all PCR and mutagenesis can be found on the World Wide Web at medschool.umaryland.edu/cvd/natarolab.html. All deletions were constructed by inverse PCR (28Tao B.Y. Lee K.C.P. Griffin H.G. Griffin A. PCR Technology: Current Innovations. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL1994: 69-83Google Scholar); primers were designed to flank the regions to be deleted. PCR was performed according to standard protocols utilizing a high fidelity polymerase (Platinum Pfx; Invitrogen) at an extension temperature of 68 °C for 2 min per kilobase of amplified DNA. 200 ng of plasmid PB9-5 was used as template with 10 pmol of each primer in a 50-μl reaction. MgCl2 concentrations were kept between 1.5 and 2 mm. The primers were designed to introduce NotI sites at both ends of the resulting PCR product, which was then NotI-digested and ligated. The result was a plasmid with a deletion of the region flanked by the primers and a new NotI restriction site at the deletion site. To follow secretion, we introduced an epitope containing the Myc epitope, His epitope, and TEV protease recognition sequence (29Ehrmann M. Bolek P. Mondigler M. Boyd D. Lange R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 13111-13115Google Scholar) (MHT) by PCR. The Myc-His epitope was amplified from plasmid PBAD/Myc-His (Invitrogen) using Platinum Pfx (Invitrogen) utilizing a primer that introduced the TEV protease site at the C terminus of the PCR product. NotI restriction sites were also introduced at both ends of the primers. This epitope was inserted by digesting it and the modified plasmids with NotI, incubating the linear plasmids with calf intestinal phosphatase, and ligating the MHT epitope into the plasmid. Proper insertion was detected by anti-His6 immunoblot analysis of bacterial supernatants. All linker deletions were sequenced for accuracy over the entire length of the passenger domain. All nested deletions were sequenced over the deletion site.Site-directed mutagenesis was performed with the QuikChange™ (Stratagene) protocol with PfuTurbo (Stratagene), a high fidelity polymerase. Template was used at 25–50 ng per reaction with 10 pmol each of complementary primers. Reactions were carried out according to the manufacturer's protocol. All constructs were sequenced at the University of Maryland, Baltimore, Biopolymer Core Facility.ELISA Quantitation of EspP Secretion—Mutant and wild-type EspP linker constructs and deletions, transformed into chemically competent (26Sambrook J. Russell D.W. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 3rd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2001Google Scholar) HB101 or UT5600, were grown in 5-ml LB cultures supplemented with 50 μg/ml kanamycin overnight. Once the cells reached stationary phase, they were centrifuged (10,000 × g at 4 °C), washed twice, and resuspended to an A600 = 4.0 in 1 ml of LB with kanamycin. Cultures were then placed at 37 °C shaking at 250 rpm and allowed to express for a total of 3 h; they were subsequently centrifuged at 10,000 × g in a refrigerated centrifuge for 20 min. 200 μl of supernatant, filtered through a 0.45-μm filter, was serially diluted 2-fold down a column to a final 1:128 dilution in a 96-well plate. All dilutions were performed in triplicate. Secreted protein was allowed to bind in the wells at 4 °C overnight. ELISAs were performed according to standard protocol (30Harlow E. Lane D. Using Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, New York1999: 269-389Google Scholar) with 0.4–0.5 μg/ml mouse anti-Myc IgG as a primary antibody and 0.2 μg/ml phosphatase labeled goat anti-mouse IgG as secondary antibody. Results were developed for an appropriate amount of time (30 min for Δ242–291, 45 min for Δ74–928) with p-nitrophenyl phosphate at 37 °C. Color reactions were measured by absorbance at λ = 405 nm. The results for linker mutants were normalized and reported as a percentage of secretion as compared with the positive native control (Δ242–291 or Δ74–928). All ELISA data reported are an average of at least two separate experiments for each mutation or deletion, each performed in triplicate.Immunoblotting—All immunoblot analyses were done according to standard protocols (30Harlow E. Lane D. Using Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, New York1999: 269-389Google Scholar). Samples were separated by 12.5% (w/v) acrylamide SDS-PAGE and transferred overnight at 34 V in Towbin's buffer (31Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Google Scholar) onto polyvinylidene difluoride. Membranes were blocked with 5% skim milk in phosphate-buffered saline/Tween. Primary anti-His6 antibody (Qiagen) was used at a concentration of 200 ng/ml; primary anti-EspP antiserum was used at a 1:5000 dilution; and primary MBP antiserum (New England Biolabs) was used at a 1:17,000 dilution. Secondary anti-mouse antibody (KPL) for the anti-His6 immunoblots was used at a concentration of 40 ng/ml, and secondary anti-rabbit antibody (KPL) for the EspP and MBP immunoblots was used at a concentration of 28.6 ng/ml. Results were visualized with ECL+ (Amersham Biosciences) and after exposure to Kodak autoradiography film for an appropriate time.Outer Membrane Preparations and SDS-PAGE Analysis—All HB101 and UT5600 strains expressing nonsecreting mutants were grown to log phase and their optical density measured. Outer membranes from equal cell densities were isolated by differential Triton X-100 solubility, as previously described (32Sheikh J. Hicks S. Dall'Agnol M. Phillips A.D. Nataro J.P. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 41: 983-997Google Scholar, 33Diedrich D.L. Summers A.O. Schnaitman C.A. J. Bacteriol. 1977; 131: 598-607Google Scholar). Bacteria were lysed in a French press and the inner membrane was solubilized in 2% Triton X-100, 5 mm MgCl2, 8 mm Tris, pH 8.0, and separated by centrifugation (13,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C) from the outer membrane. The outer membrane was then resuspended in Laemmli buffer containing 1 mm EDTA. 30 μl of this sample was analyzed by one-dimensional SDS-PAGE at an acrylamide concentration (w/v) of 15% according to standard protocols. Loading was normalized by estimating equal quantities of the OmpF and OmpC porins (34Nikaido H. Vaara M. Neidhardt F.C. Escherichia coli and Salmonella. American Society for Microbiology Press, Washington, D.

Sui B.Q. Nataro J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 39912-39920Google Scholar). The cells were then pelleted by centrifugation at 8500 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The wash was removed and filtered through a 0.45-μm filter, and 15 μl was separated by SDS-PAGE in a 12.5% (w/v) polyacrylamide gel followed by anti-His6 immunoblotting analysis. The washed pellet was then resuspended in 500 μl of 10 mm Tris, pH 8.0, and 15 μl was added to an equal volume of 2× Laemmli buffer and subjected to anti-His6 immunoblot analysis as described above.

The reactions were then stopped by adding soybean trypsin inhibitor to 200 μg/ml. The cells were centrifuged at 8500 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, and the reaction supernatant was removed from the pellet. 15 μl was separated by SDS-PAGE in a 12.5% (w/v) polyacrylamide gel, transferred overnight to polyvinylidene difluoride, and analyzed by immunoblotting with both anti-His6 and anti-EspP antibodies. The cell pellets were also resuspended in 500 μl of 10 mm Tris, pH 7.4. 15 μl of the cell suspension was used for immunoblot analysis as described for the reaction supernatant. Periplasmic extractions were performed by osmotic cold shock (37Nossal N.G. Heppel L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1966; 241: 3055-3062Google Scholar). Pellets from a secretion experiment were utilized and resulted in 1 ml of periplasmic contents. 500 μl was trichloroacetic acid-precipitated (38Marshak D.R. Kadonaga J.T. Burgess R.R. Knuth M.W.

Higgins D.G. Gibson T.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4673-4680Google Scholar) from the European Bioinformatics Institute (EMBL-EBI; available on the World Wide Web at www.ebi.ac.uk/clustalw/). Hydrophobic residues were selected and shaded using GeneDoc (available on the World Wide Web at www.psc.edu/biomed/genedoc/).RESULTSEspP Contains a Functional Linker Domain as Part of Its Translocation Unit—To characterize the secretion of SPATE proteins, we first asked whether EspP contained a linker region required for outer membrane translocation, as has been shown for numerous other autotransporters (11Klauser T.

To this end, we utilized inverse PCR to construct a series of deletion mutants in the C terminus of the passenger domain, corresponding to the putative EspP linker as determined by homologies to other autotransporters (14Oliver D.C. Huang G. Nodel E. Pleasance S. Fernandez R.C. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 47: 1367-1383Google Scholar, 16Maurer J. Jose J. Meyer T.F. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 7014-7020Google Scholar). Interestingly, Dutta and Nataro 2P. R. Dutta and J. P. Nataro, unpublished observations. have shown that there is a proteinase K-sensitive site at the N terminus of this region in the closely related autotransporter Pet, proposing that this site separates two discrete domains. The EspP gene was manipulated in clone PB9-5 (21Brunder W. Schmidt H. Karch H. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 24: 767-778Google Scholar). Primers were designed to delete the passenger domain from residue 74 to 821 (Fig. 1A) and then sequentially toward the C terminus in the suspected linker domain; this leaves the signal sequence and 19 downstream residues intact. An MHT epitope was introduced into a NotI site created at the deletion point during PCR. Resulting constructs were transformed into HB101.To assay secretion, cultures at equal cell densities were pelleted, resuspended in fresh L-broth, and incubated for 3 h. EspP in supernatants was quantitated by ELISA; secretion of deletion mutants was expressed as percentage secretion of a Δ242–291 deletion harboring the MHT epitope at the deletion site (essentially the full-length passenger). Both immunoblot analysis using anti-His6 antibodies and ELISA using anti-Myc antibodies (Fig. 1B) revealed that with successive passenger deletions extending past residue 868, secretion efficiency was decreased. Translocation was essentially undetectable when only 4 residues prior to the known EspP β cleavage site remained. Outer membrane preparations of HB101 expressing the deletion constructs were prepared by differential Triton X-100 solubilization of the inner and outer membranes (32Sheikh J. Hicks S. Dall'Agnol M. Phillips A.D. Nataro J.P. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 41: 983-997Google Scholar, 33Diedrich D.L. Summers A.O. Schnaitman C.A. J. Bacteriol. 1977; 131: 598-607Google Scholar). All constructs displayed comparable amounts of β domain in the outer membrane, suggesting that the difference in secretion efficiency was not due to differences in transcription, translation, inner membrane secretion, β domain outer membrane insertion, or processing from the β domain (Fig. 1C). We did not detect maltose-binding protein (MBP) in the supernatants of these mutants (data not shown), suggesting that detection of the passenger was not due to outer membrane permeabilization. These data agree with the prediction of a putative linker domain for EspP, the minimal functional length of which is between 27 and 5 residues upstream of the β processing site. As previously shown with AIDA-I (16Maurer J. Jose J. Meyer T.F. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 7014-7020Google Scholar), we clearly observed a decrease in secretion efficiency with deletions of increasing size, suggesting that the upstream regions of the linker domain may have a role in the secretion process.The Putative C-terminal α-Helical Region of the Linker Is Important for Secretion of a Small Foreign Epitope—The extreme C terminus of the linker domain immediately upstream of the β domain has been predicted to be an α-helix in numerous autotransporters (2Henderson I.R. Navarro-Garcia F. Nataro J.P. Trends Microbiol. 1998; 6: 370-378Google Scholar, 19Suzuki T. Lett M.C. Sasakawa C. J. Biol.

This region may play a role in the translocation of the passenger domain by providing the necessary length to traverse the barrel toward the extracellular space (17Maurer J. Jose J. Meyer T.F. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 794-804Google Scholar). Konieczny et al. (18Konieczny M.P.J. Benz I. Hollinderbaumer B. Beinke C. Niederweis M. Schmidt M.A. Antonie Leeuwenhoek. 2001; 80: 19-34Google Scholar) have also suggested that this putative helix may help to stabilize the β domain in the outer membrane, and Oomen et al. (6Oomen C.J. Van Ulsen P. Van Gelder P. Feijen M. Tommassen J. Gros P. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 1257-1266Google Scholar) have inferred, from the crystal structure, its interaction with the inner face of the β domain. We hypothesized that in EspP this predicted helical region would contribute to translocation and that disruption of this putative secondary structure would significantly diminish secretion efficiency. We chose a deletion construct (Δ74–928) that was still easily detectable by both immunoblot and ELISA (Fig. 2A). This construct maintains 95 residues upstream of the β processing site. A series of nonconservative site-directed mutations were introduced starting at residue 933 and extending to residue 1031. The secretion efficiency for these mutations was analyzed by ELISA in the same manner as for the deletion constructs above; the data were normalized against construct Δ74–928 containing no site-directed mutations and are reported as a percentage thereof (Fig. 2B). The most significant effects were seen for residues D1014K, F1018P, and E1021K. These residues are all found in the C terminus of the linker within the putative α-helix. The outer membrane preparations showed comparable levels of β domain for all constructs except D1014K (Fig. 2C). We did not detect MBP in the supernatants (data not shown). The absence of the D1014K β dom"

In addition, 11β-HSD1 plays a potential role in 7-ketocholesterol metabolism. Here we investigated the role of the N-terminal region on enzymatic activity and addressed the relevance of 11β-HSD1 orientation into the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) lumen. Previous studies revealed that the luminal orientation of 11β-HSD1 and 50-kDa esterase/arylacetamide deacetylase (E3) is determined by their highly similar N-terminal transmembrane domains. Substitution of Lys5 by Ser in 11β-HSD1, but not of the analogous Lys4 by Ile in E3, led to an inverted topology in the ER membrane, indicating the existence of a second topological determinant. Here we identified Glu25/Glu26 in 11β-HSD1 and Asp25 in E3 as the second determinant for luminal orientation. Our results suggest that the exact location of specific residues rather than net charge distribution on either side of the helix is critical for membrane topology. Analysis of charged residues in the N-terminal domain revealed an essential role of Lys35/Lys36 and Glu25/Glu26 on enzymatic activity, suggesting that these residues are responsible for the observed stabilizing effect of the N-terminal membrane anchor on the catalytic domain of 11β-HSD1. Moreover, activity measurements in intact cells expressing wild-type 11β-HSD1, facing the ER lumen, or mutant K5S/K6S, facing the cytoplasm, revealed that the luminal orientation is essential for efficient oxidation of cortisol. Furthermore, we demonstrate that 11β-HSD1, but not mutant K5S/K6S with cytoplasmic orientation, catalyzes the oxoreduction of 7-ketocholesterol. 11β-HSD1 and E3 constructs with cytosolic orientation of their catalytic moiety should prove useful in future studies addressing the physiological function of these proteins.

Recent animal experiments provided insight into the pathophysiological role of 11β-HSD1. Mice deficient of 11β-HSD1 were resistant to hyperglycemia induced by obesity or stress (1Kotelevtsev Y. Holmes M.C. Burchell A. Houston P.M. Schmoll D. Jamieson P. Best R. Brown R. Edwards C.R. Seckl J.R. Mullins J.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 14924-14929Google Scholar), whereas transgenic mice overexpressing 11β-HSD1 developed visceral obesity with insulin resistance and dyslipidemia. In addition, overexpression of 11β-HSD1 in adipose tissue caused salt-sensitive hypertension mediated by an activated renin-angiotensin system (2Masuzaki H. Paterson J. Shinyama H. Morton N.M. Mullins J.J. Seckl J.R. Flier J.S. Science. 2001; 294: 2166-2170Google Scholar, 3Masuzaki H. Yamamoto H. Kenyon C.J. Elmquist J.K. Morton N.M. Paterson J.M. Shinyama H. Sharp M.G. Fleming S. Mullins J.J. Seckl J.R. Flier J.S. J. Clin. Investig. 2003; 112: 83-90Google Scholar). Experiments in obese and diabetic mice treated with a specific 11β-HSD1 inhibitor showed reduced blood glucose levels and increased insulin sensitivity (4Barf T. Vallgarda J. Emond R. Haggstrom C.

Endocrinology. 2003; 144: 4755-4762Google Scholar). Therefore, 11β-HSD1 is currently considered a promising drug target for the treatment of cognitive dysfunction in elderly men and patients with obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus (6Chrousos G.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 6329-6330Google Scholar, 7Sandeep T.C. Yau J.L. MacLullich A.M. Noble J. Deary I.J. Walker B.R. Seckl J.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 6734-6739Google Scholar). However, whether 11β-HSD1 is indeed a suitable target for therapeutic treatment of excessive glucocorticoid actions remains to be tested. Recently, we provided evidence that 11β-HSD1 plays a role in the rapid hepatic metabolism of 7-ketocholesterol (7KC) (8Schweizer R.A. Zurcher M. Balazs Z. Dick B. Odermatt A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 18415-18424Google Scholar), the major oxysterol in processed cholesterol-rich food and, after 27-hydroxycholesterol, in advanced atherosclerotic plaques (9Bjorkhem I. Andersson O.

Atherosclerosis. 1999; 142: 1-28Google Scholar, 11Schroepfer Jr., G.J. Physiol. Rev. 2000; 80: 361-554Google Scholar). In rats treated with 7KC and the 11β-HSD inhibitor carbenoxolone, 7KC tended to accumulate in liver and plasma (8Schweizer R.A. Zurcher M. Balazs Z. Dick B. Odermatt A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 18415-18424Google Scholar). In addition, 11β-HSD1 seems to catalyze the interconversion of 7-hydroxylated dehydroepiandrosterone metabolites (12Robinzon B. Michael K.K. Ripp S.L. Winters S.J. Prough R.A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2003; 412: 251-258Google Scholar) and has a potential role in biotransformation by reducing reactive ketones such as the potent tobacco carcinogen nicotine-derived nitrosamine ketone, the anti-cancer drug oracin, as well as metyrapone and its derivatives (13Sampath-Kumar R. Yu M. Khalil M.W. Yang K. J. Steroid. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1997; 62: 195-199Google Scholar, 14Bannenberg G. Martin H.J. Belai I. Maser E. Chem. Biol.

Interact. 2003; 143: 459-468Google Scholar). Despite its importance, relatively little is known about the molecular mechanisms by which 11β-HSD1 exerts its physiological function. 11β-HSD1 belongs to the family of short-chain dehydrogenases-reductases, characterized by a core domain with conserved regions, including the Rossmann fold for binding of the cofactor NADP(H) and the Tyr-(Xaa)3-Lys motif in the catalytic site, and less conserved N- and C-terminal sequences (17White P.C. Mune T. Agarwal A.K. Endocr. Rev. 1997; 18: 135-156Google Scholar, 18Stewart P.M. Krozowski Z.S. Vitam. Horm. 1999; 57: 249-324Google Scholar). Several studies using 11β-HSD1 constructs with N-terminal deletions demonstrated that this part of the enzyme is not only essential to anchor the enzyme to the ER membrane but also for stability and catalytic activity (19Odermatt A. Arnold P. Stauffer A. Frey B.M. Frey F.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28762-28770Google Scholar, 20Walker E.A. Clark A.M. Hewison M. Ride J.P. Stewart P.M. J. Biol.

The residues involved, however, were not identified. We have shown previously (19Odermatt A. Arnold P. Stauffer A. Frey B.M. Frey F.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28762-28770Google Scholar, 23Mziaut H. Korza G. Hand A.R. Gerard C. Ozols J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 14122-14129Google Scholar) that the single N-terminal transmembrane helix is responsible for the luminal orientation of the catalytic moiety of 11β-HSD1. However, in contrast to 11β-HSD2, whose cytoplasmic orientation is required to tether the mineralocorticoid receptor to the ER membrane in the absence of steroid and that prevents its occupation by cortisol through conversion of cortisol to cortisone (24Odermatt A. Arnold P. Frey F.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 28484-28492Google Scholar), the physiological role of the luminal orientation of 11β-HSD1 remained unclear. In our previous study (19Odermatt A. Arnold P. Stauffer A. Frey B.M. Frey F.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28762-28770Google Scholar), we demonstrated that substitution of Lys5 by Ser in the short cytoplasmic N terminus of 11β-HSD1 inverted its topology in the ER membrane. Surprisingly, no difference was found for the oxoreduction of 11-dehydrocorticosterone between the mutant enzyme with cytoplasmic orientation and wild-type 11β-HSD1 upon expression in HEK-293 cells. The N-terminal transmembrane span of 11β-HSD1 is highly similar to that of the 50-kDa esterase/arylacetamide deacetylase (E3) (23Mziaut H. Korza G. Hand A.R. Gerard C. Ozols J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 14122-14129Google Scholar), two proteins that are otherwise unrelated (Fig. 1A). E3, which is highly expressed in liver and adrenal glands and to a lesser extent in small intestine, stomach, kidney, and pancreas (25Trickett J.I. Patel D.D. Knight B.L. Saggerson E.D. Gibbons G.F. Pease R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 39522-39532Google Scholar), acts as an N-deacetylase catalyzing hydrolytic reactions and plays a potential role in the prevention of arylamine-induced carcinogenesis (26Probst M.R. Beer M. Beer D. Jeno P. Meyer U.A. Gasser R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21650-21656Google Scholar). E3 might be involved, like the putative triacylglycerol hydrolase E1, in the assembly of hepatic very low density lipoprotein in the ER lumen (25Trickett J.I. Patel D.D. Knight B.L. Saggerson E.D. Gibbons G.F. Pease R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 39522-39532Google Scholar). A significantly reduced expression of E3 was observed in insulin-deficient diabetes, which is characterized by a severe decrease in the secretion of hepatic very low density lipoprotein triacylglycerol. Unlike Lys5 in 11β-HSD1, substitution of the analogous Lys4 in E3 had no effect on topology, suggesting the existence of a second determinant for the orientation of these enzymes in the ER membrane (19Odermatt A. Arnold P. Stauffer A. Frey B.M. Frey F.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28762-28770Google Scholar, 23Mziaut H. Korza G. Hand A.R. Gerard C. Ozols J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 14122-14129Google Scholar). Here we tested the hypothesis whether the negatively charged residues on the luminal side of the transmembrane span might act as a second determinant for the orientation of these two enzymes in the ER membrane, and we studied the effect of charged amino acid residues on 11β-HSD1 activity. In addition, we investigated the role of the luminal orientation of 11β-HSD1 on the oxidation of cortisol and the oxoreduction of cortisone and 7KC. Materials—Cell culture reagents were purchased from Invitrogen; [1,2,6,7-3H]cortisone and [1,2,6-3H]7KC were from American Radiolabeled Chemicals, St. Louis, MO; [1,2,6,7-3H]cortisol was from Amersham Biosciences; 7KC and 7β-hydroxycholesterol were from Steraloids (Wilton, NH); and fluorescence-labeled antibodies were from Molecular Probes. Proteinase K was from Roche Diagnostics, and all other chemicals were from Fluka AG, Buchs, Switzerland, and were of the highest grade available. Construction of Plasmids—The plasmid for expression of FLAG epitope-tagged human 11β-HSD1 was constructed as described (19Odermatt A. Arnold P. Stauffer A. Frey B.M. Frey F.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28762-28770Google Scholar). Mutant 11β-HSD1 constructs were generated by site-directed mutagenesis according to the QuickChange mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The rabbit E3-enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) chimera, containing the N-terminal membrane anchor sequence of E3 with a C-terminal EGFP, was constructed as described (23Mziaut H. Korza G. Hand A.R. Gerard C. Ozols J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 14122-14129Google Scholar). For immunofluorescence experiments, a construct containing the N-terminal 34 amino acids of rabbit E3 followed by a FLAG epitope tag was generated by three-piece ligation of an EcoRI-BamHI fragment containing the N-terminal 34 amino acids of E3, a BamHI-XbaI fragment encoding the FLAG epitope (MDYKDDDD), and an EcoRI-XbaI pcDN3 expression vector fragment. Mutant E3-FLAG and-EGFP constructs were made by site-directed mutagenesis. All constructs were verified by sequencing. Cell Culture and Transient Transfection—HEK-293 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 4.5 g/liter glucose, 50 units/ml penicillin, 50 mg/ml streptomycin, and 2 mm glutamine. For microscopy experiments, cells were seeded at ∼10% confluence onto glass coverslips placed in 6-well plates. After growth for 24 h at 37 °C under 5% CO2, cells were transfected by Ca2+-phosphate precipitation with 2 μg/well of the corresponding expression plasmid and 1 μg/well EGFP control plasmid. After incubation for 8 h, the medium was replaced to remove the Ca2+-phosphate precipitate. For isolation of microsomes and activity analysis, cells were seeded to 50% confluence in 10-cm dishes and transfected, and medium was replaced or cells were washed three times with steroid-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (doubly charcoal-treated). Selective Permeabilization and Immunofluorescence Analysis—Immunofluorescence analysis was performed 48 h post-transfection as described previously (24Odermatt A. Arnold P. Frey F.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 28484-28492Google Scholar). Briefly, paraformaldehyde (4%) fixed cells coexpressing the corresponding FLAG-tagged construct and EGFP control were washed four times with the buffer NAPS (150 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.4, 120 mm sucrose). For complete permeabilization of membranes, cells were blocked in NAPS buffer containing 1% milk powder and either 0.5% Triton X-100, for 11β-HSD1 constructs, or 1% saponin, for E3 constructs. The fluorescence signal obtained for E3 constructs was much stronger when saponin was used instead of Triton X-100, an observation made previously with N-terminally FLAG-tagged 11β-HSD1. The reason is unknown, but it seems that Triton X-100 interferes with antibody-epitope interactions in close proximity to the membrane. For semipermeabilization of the plasma membrane, 25 μm digitonin was used (19Odermatt A. Arnold P. Stauffer A. Frey B.M. Frey F.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28762-28770Google Scholar). FLAG-tagged constructs were detected using anti-FLAG antibody M2 as primary antibody and ALEXA-594 goat anti-mouse secondary antibody. EGFP served as a transfection efficiency control. Following incubation with antibodies in NAPS containing 0.1% milk, samples were washed four times with NAPS and treated with Slow Fade Antifade kit (Molecular Probes). Samples were analyzed on a Carl Zeiss confocal microscope LSM410 (Carl Zeiss, Goettingen, Germany). Isolation of Microsomes from HEK-293 Cells—HEK-293 cells were transfected with 8 μg of the corresponding expression plasmid per 10-cm dish. Cells from four dishes were collected 48 h post-transfection, washed with phosphate-buffered saline, and centrifuged at 150 × g for 3 min, and the pellet was resuspended in 1.2 ml of buffer containing 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.5 m MgCl2, and protease inhibitor (Complete, Roche Diagnostics). Cells were sonicated; 1.2 ml of isotonic buffer (1 m sucrose, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 2.5 m NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol) was added, and lysates were centrifuged at 1,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, followed by centrifugation at 11,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C and 100,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C. The pellet was resuspended in 300 μl of buffer containing 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.5 m sucrose, 1.25 m NaCl, and 0.5 mm dithiothreitol. The protein concentration was adjusted to 1 mg/ml, and microsomal preparations were shock-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at –70 °C until analysis. Protease Protection Assay and Immunoblotting—Microsomes (20 μg of proteins) were incubated in a total volume of 25 μl with 0.25 μg/μl proteinase K (Roche Diagnostics) for 30 min on ice in the presence or absence of 0.5% Triton X-100. Proteinase K was inactivated by adding 2.5 μl of 10 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride in isopropyl alcohol for 5 min, followed by solubilization of proteins with SDS sample buffer and boiling for 5 min. Proteins were subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis using anti-FLAG antibody M2 or anti-EGFP antibody as primary antibodies and secondary horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibody (Roche Diagnostics). Antibody binding was visualized using the enhanced chemiluminescence Western detection system (Pierce). Assay for 11β-HSD—11β-HSD1-dependent oxidation and oxoreduction were measured as described previously (19Odermatt A. Arnold P. Stauffer A. Frey B.M. Frey F.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28762-28770Google Scholar, 27Schweizer R.A. Atanasov A.G. Frey B.M. Odermatt A. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 2003; 212: 41-49Google Scholar). Briefly, the rate of conversion of cortisol to cortisone or the reverse reaction was determined in a final volume of 20 μl in a TG1 buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm MgCl2, 100 mm NaCl, 20% glycerol) supplemented with 400 μm NADP+ or NADPH, 30 nCi of 3H-labeled substrate, and unlabeled substrate at different concentrations ranging from 12.5 nm to 2 μm. Cell lysates were prepared by washing transfected cells with phosphate-buffered saline, centrifugation for 3 min at 150 × g, removal of the supernatant, and quick-freezing the cell pellet in a dry ice ethanol bath. Cell pellets were resuspended in buffer TG1, sonicated, and used immediately for activity assays. The reactions were started by mixing 10 μl of cell extract corresponding to 2–5 μg of total proteins with 10 μl of reaction mixture and incubated for 10–20 min at 37 °C. When measuring activities in intact cells, steroid-free medium was used, and cofactor was omitted. To assess the effect of cyclosporin A, cells were preincubated for 15 min with 50 μm cyclosporin A prior to addition of cortisone. The reactions were stopped by adding an excess of unlabeled steroids in methanol, followed by separation of steroids by TLC. Enzyme kinetics were analyzed by nonlinear regression using Data Analysis Toolbox (MDL Information Systems Inc.) assuming first-order rate kinetics. Hill coefficients for measurements in lysates were ranging between 0.94 and 1.17. Data represent mean ± S.D. of at least four independent transfections. Oxoreduction of 7KC was determined as described (8Schweizer R.A. Zurcher M. Balazs Z. Dick B. Odermatt A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 18415-18424Google Scholar). Briefly, freshly prepared lysates were suspended in buffer TG1 and 400 μm NADP+, 400 nm 7KC, and 30 nCi of 3H-labeled 7KC added, followed by incubation at 37 °C for 15 or 30 min. Intact cells were incubated in steroid-free medium in the absence of cofactor for 30 or 60 min. The reactions were stopped by adding an excess of unlabeled oxycholesterols in methanol, followed by separation by TLC and scintillation counting. Sequence Comparison of the N Termini of 11β-HSD1 and E3—An alignment of the sequences of human 11β-HSD1 and rabbit E3 revealed that both proteins share a similar N-terminal region (Fig. 1A) with a short and positively charged N-terminal cytoplasmic part, a single transmembrane span followed by negatively charged residues immediately downstream of the membrane helix, and a large C-terminal luminal domain. In previous studies, we have shown that substitution of Lys5 by Ser led to inverted orientation of 11β-HSD1 in the ER membrane (19Odermatt A. Arnold P. Stauffer A. Frey B.M. Frey F.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28762-28770Google Scholar), whereas substitution of the analogous Lys4 by Ile in E3 had no effect on topology (23Mziaut H. Korza G. Hand A.R. Gerard C. Ozols J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 14122-14129Google Scholar), indicating the existence of a second determinant for the topology of these two proteins. The Cytoplasmic Lys4 and the Luminal Asp25 Determine the Topology of E3—To test the hypothesis that the negatively charged residues immediately downstream of the membrane span represent this second topology determining motif, we generated a fusion protein encoding the N-terminal 34 amino acids of E3 followed by a FLAG epitope for facilitated immunodetection, and we subjected this construct to site-specific mutagenesis (Fig. 1B). Cells coexpressing the corresponding FLAG-tagged construct and EGFP control protein were either completely permeabilized with 1% saponin or the plasma membrane was selectively permeabilized with 25 μm digitonin, allowing restricted access of the anti-FLAG antibody to the cytosolic compartment. Cells were then incubated with anti-FLAG antibody and red fluorescent secondary antibody and analyzed by fluorescence microscopy. Cells expressing EGFP were analyzed for the presence of red fluorescence signal from the corresponding E3 construct, whereby 200–300 cells were counted in a typical experiment. By using saponin, over 95% of cells expressing wild-type E3 stained positive but less than 5% when digitonin was used, in line with the luminal orientation of E3 (Fig. 2). Mutant K4I showed wild-type orientation, confirming previous findings (23Mziaut H. Korza G. Hand A.R. Gerard C. Ozols J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 14122-14129Google Scholar). To investigate the role of negatively charged residues at the luminal side of the transmembrane helix, we replaced Asp25, Glu28, and Glu29 to Lys in either wild-type E3 or mutant K4I (Fig. 1B). Substitution of the negatively charged residues by Lys led to inverted insertion into the ER membrane in mutant K4I/D25K/E28K/E29K but not in mutant D25K/E28K/E29K (Fig. 2). Additional mutagenesis revealed that substitution of Asp25/Glu28/Glu29 to Asn25/Gln28/Gln29 and a single substitution of Asp25 by Lys in mutant K4I both were sufficient to invert the orientation in the ER membrane. All of the mutant proteins analyzed showed exclusive localization to the ER membrane, indicating that they are not important for ER retention. These results demonstrate that both Lys4 and Asp25 are essential for determining the topology of E3. The effects on topology were confirmed by subjecting microsomal vesicles expressing wild-type or mutant constructs to proteinase K digestion in the presence or absence of detergent (data not shown). The Luminal Residues Glu25 and Glu26 Are Important Determinants for the Topology of 11β-HSD1—In analogy to Asp25 of E3, 11β-HSD1 contains two glutamate residues (Glu25 and Glu26) immediately downstream of the membrane span. To investigate whether the luminal di-glutamate motif plays a role in determining the topology of 11β-HSD1, we generated a series of constructs with a C-terminal FLAG epitope (Fig. 1C) and analyzed them in fully permeabilized (0.5% Triton X-100) or semipermeabilized (25 μm digitonin) cells by immunofluorescence detection. Substitution of both Glu25 and Glu26 to Lys led to an inverted orientation of 11β-HSD1 in the ER membrane (Fig. 3). Substitution of Glu25 by Lys and Glu26 by Gln (mutant E25K/E26Q) did not change the orientation of the mutant enzyme, indicating that the change from positive to negative charge at both positions is necessary to invert the topology of 11β-HSD1. We have shown previously that mutant K5S but not K6S showed inverted topology. To assess a potential role of Lys6 in determining topology, we mutated Glu25 and Glu26 in mutant K6S. Independent of the residue at position 6, the orientation of the enzyme was only inverted when both Glu25 and Glu26 were changed to Lys (Fig. 1C and Fig. 3). These results indicate that Lys6 is not involved in determining the topology of 11β-HSD1. In addition, all mutations analyzed in the present study did not alter the restricted expression of 11β-HSD1 in the ER membrane (not shown). To confirm the effect of these mutations on 11β-HSD1 topology, microsomal vesicles expressing FLAG-tagged wild-type or mutant 11β-HSD1 constructs were subjected to proteinase K digestion in the presence or absence of detergents, followed by separation on SDS-PAGE and detection with anti-FLAG antibody on Western blots. As seen in Fig. 4, in intact vesicles mutants E25K/E26K and K6S/E25K/E26K were completely digested by proteinase K, whereas wild-type 11β-HSD1 and all other mutants were protected from proteinase K-dependent digestion. Upon addition of Triton X-100, all constructs were digested. These results are consistent with the findings from fluorescence microscopic analyses of semipermeabilized cells, demonstrating an essential role of Glu25 and Glu26 in determining the orientation of 11β-HSD1 in the ER membrane. The Effect of Charged Residues in the N-terminal Region of 11β-HSD1 on Enzymatic Activity in Lysates—To assess the effect of charged residues in the N-terminal region of 11β-HSD1 on enzymatic activity, the reduction of cortisone to cortisol was measured in lysates of cells expressing wild-type or mutant 11β-HSD1. None of the mutations had a significant effect on apparent Km values (Table I); however, replacement of both Glu25 and Glu26 by Gln or Lys led to a significant decrease in activity (p < 0.01), with a tendency for a loss of Vmax when substituting the negatively charged Glu residues first by polar Gln and then by positively charged Lys. The fact that mutant K6S/E25K/E26Q with luminal orientation and mutant K6S/E25K/E26K with cytoplasmic orientation both had similarly reduced activities suggests that the di-glutamate motif at position 25/26 stabilizes enzymatic activity independent of the orientation of 11β-HSD1 in the ER membrane. In addition, mutant K5S/K6S showed kinetic values comparable with that of wild-type 11β-HSD1, indicating that the orientation in the ER membrane itself does not affect enzymatic activity. Similar effects of these mutations were observed for the oxidation of corticosterone (data not shown).Table IReduction of cortisone by wild-type and mutant 11β-HSD1 in lysatesConstructKmaApparent Km (nm) and apparent Vmax (nmol × h-1 × mg-1 of total protein) values were calculated by nonlinear regression using Data Analysis Toolbox (MDL Information Systems Inc.) assuming first-order rate kinetics (Hill coefficients ranging between 0.94 and 1.17).VmaxaApparent Km (nm) and apparent Vmax (nmol × h-1 × mg-1 of total protein) values were calculated by nonlinear regression using Data Analysis Toolbox (MDL Information Systems Inc.) assuming first-order rate kinetics (Hill coefficients ranging between 0.94 and 1.17).,bFor calculation of Vmax, the amount of 11β-HSD1 protein per mg of total proteins was determined, and values were normalized to the expression of FLAG-tagged wild-type 11β-HSD1 by semiquantitative densitometric analysis of Western blotsnmnmol × h-1 × mg-111β-HSD1 (wild type)336 ± 391.88 ± 0.23E25Q307 ± 351.55 ± 0.15E25K346 ± 201.66 ± 0.27E26K303 ± 371.23 ± 0.33cp < 0.05 compared with wild type.K6S/E25K314 ± 211.63 ± 0.30E25Q/E26Q308 ± 291.07 ± 0.13dp < 0.01 compared with wild type.K6S/E25Q/E26Q302 ± 220.80 ± 0.17dp < 0.01 compared with wild type.E25K/E26Q300 ± 280.84 ± 0.15dp < 0.01 compared with wild type.K6S/E25K/E26Q314 ± 340.57 ± 0.17dp < 0.01 compared with wild type.E25K/E26K299 ± 220.37 ± 0.08dp < 0.01 compared with wild type.K6S/E25K/E26K344 ± 490.59 ± 0.13dp < 0.01 compared with wild type.K5S/K6S/E25K/E26K340 ± 360.39 ± 0.02dp < 0.01 compared with wild type.K5S/K6S295 ± 251.75 ± 0.14K35S/K36SNDeActivity was not detectable despite normal expression levels.NDeActivity was not detectable despite normal expression levels.a Apparent Km (nm) and apparent Vmax (nmol × h-1 × mg-1 of total protein) values were calculated by nonlinear regression using Data Analysis Toolbox (MDL Information Systems Inc.) assuming first-order rate kinetics (Hill coefficients ranging between 0.94 and 1.17).b For calculation of Vmax, the amount of 11"

Soluble L1 is produced by metalloprotease-mediated ectodomain shedding of L1. We investigated effects of hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), a growth factor shown to increase invasiveness of renal carcinoma cells, on ectodomain shedding of L1 from these cells. All of the tested L1-positive renal carcinoma cell lines released a 180-kDa form of L1 into the medium. In the presence of serum, addition of HGF led to a dose-dependent increase in L1 shedding with a maximum reached at 5 ng/ml. In contrast, L1 shedding was inhibited by glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF). The tyrosine kinase inhibitor Genistein reduced basal and HGF-stimulated L1 shedding, indicating that protein phosphorylation is involved. To investigate the role of the L1 intracellular domain, two mutants of the L1 cytoplasmic part were constructed. L1trun lacking the complete intracellular domain showed enhanced basal shedding. In a L1YH mutant, containing the mutation tyrosine 1229 to histidine that deletes the ankyrin binding motif of L1, basal shedding was reduced. Disruption of actin assembly by cytochalasin D also reduced shedding of L1. These results indicate that the cytoplasmic domain regulates basal shedding of L1, and association with the cytoskeleton through the L1 ankyrin binding site is involved. HGF stimulated L1 shedding in both mutants, indicating that receptor-mediated phosphorylation in the L1 cytoplasmic domain is not required for HGF-stimulated shedding.

The L1 cell adhesion molecule (L1) 1The abbreviations used are: L1, L1 cell adhesion molecule; HGF, hepatocyte growth factor; GDNF, glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor; HEK, human embryonic kidney; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; FCS, fetal calf serum; BSA, bovine serum albumin; mAb, monoclonal antibody. was originally described as a protein of the nervous system, and mutated forms of L1 are linked to severe neurological pathologies referred to as MASA syndrome (1Kenwrick S. Watkins A. De Angelis E. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2000; 9: 879-886Google Scholar). A non-neuronal isoform of L1 lacking exons 2 and 27 is expressed at low levels in the normal adult human kidney (2Meli M.L. Carrel F. Waibel R. Amstutz H. Crompton N. Jaussi R. Moch H. Schubiger P.A. Novak-Hofer I. Int. J. Cancer. 1999; 83: 401-408Google Scholar) as well as during renal development (3Debiec H. Christensen E.I. Ronco P.M. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 2067-2079Google Scholar). In contrast, high expression of L1 was found in 8 of 12 renal tumor cell lines and in some renal tumors (2Meli M.L. Carrel F. Waibel R. Amstutz H. Crompton N. Jaussi R. Moch H. Schubiger P.A. Novak-Hofer I. Int. J. Cancer. 1999; 83: 401-408Google Scholar). 2I. Novak-Hofer, M. Heiz, J. Grünberg, and G. Thalman, unpublished data. It was shown that the cell-bound form of L1 can serve as a target for radioimmunodiagnosis of metastatic neuroblastoma (4Hoefnagel C.A. Rutgers M. Buitenhuis C.K. Smets L.A. de Kraker J. Meli M. Carrel F. Amstutz H. Schubiger P.A. Novak-Hofer I. Eur. J. Nucl. Med. 2001; 28: 359-368Google Scholar), and L1 may also be a marker and therapeutic target for certain renal cancers. In cultured cell lines originating from a number of different tumors the L1 ectodomain was found to be cleaved proximal to the cell membrane by metalloproteases, followed by release of soluble L1 into the medium (5Beer S. Oleszewski M. Gutwein P. Geiger C. Altevogt P. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 2667-2675Google Scholar, 6Gutwein P. Oleszewski M. Mechtersheimer S. Agmon-Levin N. Krauss K. Altevogt P. J. Biol.

Ectodomain shedding of L1 could be stimulated by phorbol esters and vanadate, indicating that phosphorylation events regulate L1 release (6Gutwein P. Oleszewski M. Mechtersheimer S. Agmon-Levin N. Krauss K. Altevogt P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 15490-15497Google Scholar). In cell culture soluble L1 substrate was found to stimulate cellular motility and migration (8Mechtersheimer S. Gutwein P. Agmon-Levin N. Stoeck A. Oleszewski M. Riedle S. Postina R. Fahrenholz F. Fogel M. Lemmon V. Altevogt P. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 155: 661-673Google Scholar). Release of soluble L1 is not restricted to cells in culture as soluble L1 was recently detected in serum samples of patients with ovarian and uterine tumors and is believed to lead to increased cell migration and metastatic spread in these malignancies (9Fogel M. Gutwein P. Mechtersheimer S. Riedle S. Stoeck A. Smirnov A. Edler L. Ben-Arie A. Huszar M. Altevogt P. Lancet. 2003; 362: 869-875Google Scholar). Here we investigated whether hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) and glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) influence shedding of L1 from renal carcinoma cells. Changes in the normal expression patterns of HGF and GDNF are associated with abnormal proliferation in the human renal system. While in the normal human kidney, HGF and c-Met are expressed at very low levels, increased HGF and c-Met expression is found in about 90% of renal cell carcinomas (10Natali P.G. Prat M. Nicotra M.R.

Apmis. 2002; 110: 229-238Google Scholar), and overexpression of HGF/c-Met enhances cellular motility of renal carcinoma cells in vitro and in vivo (13Nakamura T. Kanda S. Yamamoto K. Kohno T. Maeda K. Matsuyama T. Kanetake H. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 7610-7623Google Scholar, 14Miyata Y. Ashida S. Nakamura T. Mochizuki Y. Koga S. Kanetake H. Shuin T. Kanda S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 302: 892-897Google Scholar). GDNF is overexpressed in renal dysplasia (15El-Ghoneimi A. Berrebi D. Levacher B. Nepote V. Infante M. Paris R. Simonneau M. Aigrain Y. Peuchmaur M. J. Urol. 2002; 168: 2624-2628Google Scholar) and in collecting duct cysts (16Lee D.C. Chan K.W. Chan S.Y. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 5582-5592Google Scholar). During kidney organogenesis, HGF and GDNF, as well as L1 are important for ureteric bud outgrowth and branching morphogenesis (17Davies J. J. Anat. 2001; 198: 257-264Google Scholar). In vivo, L1 knock-out mice show improper growth and branching patterns of ureteral branches (18Debiec H. Kutsche M. Schachner M. Ronco P. Nephrol. Dial. Transplant. 2002; 17: 42-44Google Scholar), and blocking of HGF function inhibits proliferation and branching in kidney organ cultures (17Davies J. J. Anat. 2001; 198: 257-264Google Scholar). Effects of growth factors on L1 could be mediated by direct interaction of receptors with the L1 extracellular domain. This is suggested by the findings that L1-mediated cell adhesion activates the fibroblast growth factor (FGF) receptor (19Saffell J.L. Williams E.J. Mason I.J. Walsh F.S. Doherty P. Neuron. 1997; 18: 231-242Google Scholar) and the epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor (20Islam R. Kristiansen L.V. Romani S. Garcia-Alonso L. Hortsch M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 2003-2012Google Scholar) tyrosine phosphorylation, respectively, the latter an effect which appears to involve L1/EGF receptor trans interactions (20Islam R. Kristiansen L.V. Romani S. Garcia-Alonso L. Hortsch M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 2003-2012Google Scholar). On the other hand, the cytoplasmic domain of L1 contains several phosphorylation sites and it was shown before that phosphorylation events induced by growth factors regulate the interaction of the L1 family member neurofascin with the ankyrin/actin network and L1 lateral movement (21Kamiguchi H. Lemmon V. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 598-605Google Scholar, 22Garver T.D. Ren Q. Tuvia S. Bennett V. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 703-714Google Scholar, 23Gil O.D. Sakurai T. Bradley A.E. Fink M.Y. Cassella M.R. Kuo J.A. Felsenfeld D.P. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 162: 719-730Google Scholar). We show here that shedding of L1 is a regulated process, triggered by the physiological factor HGF, which is overexpressed in renal carcinomas. When we investigated the effect of mutations in the intracellular domain of L1 on basal and HGF-stimulated release of soluble L1, we found that the cytoplasmic domain of L1 and its interaction with the actin cytoskeleton regulate basal, but not HGF-stimulated L1 shedding.

This cell line is a derivative of HEK293 cells into which the gene for the temperature-sensitive SV40 T-antigen mutant tsA1609 has been inserted, which leads to a large production of replication-competent T antigen at 37 °C (25DuBridge R.B.

The anti-c-Met antibody C-12 and the anti-c-Ret antibody C-19 were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (LabForce, Nunningen, Switzerland). The anti-mouse IgG-horseradish peroxidase antibody conjugate W402B was from Promega (Catalys, Wallisellen, Switzerland). The anti-rabbit IgG-horseradish peroxidase and anti-goat IgG-horseradish peroxidase antibody conjugates were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (LabForce). Protein G-Sepharose 4 FF was obtained from Amersham Biosciences. All other chemicals were purchased from Fluka (Buchs, Switzerland). Cell Lysis and Immunoprecipitation—Cells were washed twice with PBS and detached with 1 mm EDTA in PBS. After centrifugation for 5 min at 500 × g, cells were lysed in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40 (lysis buffer) containing Complete™ Protease Inhibitor Mixture (Roche Diagnostics) and incubated on ice for 10 min. Cell lysates were centrifuged for 10 min at 16,000 × g at 4 °C, and the protein concentration of the supernatant was measured using the DC Protein Assay from Bio-Rad. For immunoprecipitation of L1 and c-Met, 500 μg of protein in 300 μl of lysis buffer were precleared with 20 μl of protein-G-Sepharose suspension (10% in lysis buffer, PGS) for 30 min at 4 °C. After preclearing, lysates were incubated with 20 μl of PGS and the corresponding antibody (2 μg of chCE7 for L1, 1 μg of C-12 for c-Met) for 2 h at 4 °C. Protein G-Sepharose beads were washed twice with lysis buffer and once with Tris-HCl, pH 7.5 and analyzed by Western blotting. For analysis of soluble L1 in the medium, cell supernatant was precleared with 50 μl of PGS for 30 min at 4 °C. Immunoprecipitation of soluble L1 was performed overnight with 6 μg of chCE7 and 50 μl of PGS at 4 °C. Samples were centrifuged for 5 min at 1700 × g and 4 °C, Protein-G-Sepharose beads were washed as described and analyzed by immunoblotting using mAb UJ127.11. Separation of Triton X-100-soluble and -insoluble Membrane Fraction—Isolation of Triton X-100-insoluble membrane fractions was performed as described in Ref. 28Dihne M. Bernreuther C. Sibbe M. Paulus W. Schachner M. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 6638-6650Google Scholar with modifications. Foehn cells on 15-cm plates were detached with 1 mm EDTA in PBS, and cells were centrifuged at 500 × g for 5 min at 4 °C. Cells were homogenized on ice in TNE buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA) including Complete™ Protease Inhibitor Mixture using a Dounce homogenizer. Homogenates were centrifuged at 200 × g and 4 °C for 5 min. The supernatants were centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C. The pellets were resuspended in 200 μl of TNE buffer, pH 11, containing 1% Triton X-100 and incubated on ice for 30 min followed by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C. The Triton X-100-insoluble material was dissolved in 50 μl of TNE buffer containing 1% SDS, and 450 μl of TNE buffer was added. For analysis of L1 and c-Met distribution, both supernatant and dissolved pellet were subjected to immunoprecipitation and Western blotting. For analysis of L1 distribution after HGF stimulation, Foehn cell cultures with a confluency of 80% were serum-starved overnight. Cells were stimulated for 30 min with starve-medium containing 10 ng/ml HGF or 10% FCS as control, and analysis of Triton X-100-soluble and -insoluble membrane fractions was performed as described above. Western Blot Analysis—Protein samples or immunoprecipitates were mixed with sample buffer and boiled for 5 min. Samples were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis under reducing conditions on 7.5% gels, except for detection with mAb chCE7 where non-reducing conditions are required. The proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore) by semi-dry electroblotting, and the membranes were blocked for 1 h at room temperature with 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA) in Tris-buffered saline (TBST, 20 mm Tris-HCl, 500 mm NaCl, 0.05% Tween-20, pH 7.5). The membranes were incubated with the respective primary antibody in 1% BSA in TBST for 1 h at room temperature or overnight at 4 °C, washed three times with TBST for 15 min, and probed with the corresponding horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (1:20,000 in 1% BSA in TBST) for 30 min at room temperature. After three washes with TBST for 15 min, immunodetection was performed using the enhanced chemiluminescence kit (Pierce). Primary antibodies were used in a 1:1000 (chCE7), 1:100 (UJ127.11), 1:200 (74–5H7, c-Met, c-Ret) dilution. L1 Cell Surface Expression—Cell surface expression of L1 in transfected 293T cells was determined by measuring binding sites for mAb chCE7. mAb chCE7 was labeled with 125I as described previously (2Meli M.L. Carrel F. Waibel R. Amstutz H. Crompton N. Jaussi R. Moch H. Schubiger P.A. Novak-Hofer I. Int. J. Cancer. 1999; 83: 401-408Google Scholar). 24 h after transfection of 293T cells, medium was changed, and cells were incubated for 3 h. 0.5 × 106 cells/ml were incubated in a total volume of 0.5 ml of 0.5% BSA in PBS, 100,000 cpm of 125I-chCE7 and increasing concentrations of unlabeled chCE7 (75–1200 ng) overnight at 4 °C on a shaking platform. Cells were washed twice with 0.5% BSA in PBS, and cell-associated radioactivity was counted in a γ-counter. Saturation curves were analyzed by the Scatchard method. Proliferation Assay—RCC-GW cells were seeded in triplicate at 50,000 cells per well on 6-well plates in 2 ml of serum-free medium. Either HGF (20 ng/ml) or GDNF (10 ng/ml) were added, and cells were incubated for the indicated time points. Cells were removed with 0.05% trypsin, 0.5 mm EDTA in PBS and counted in a hemocytometer. To evaluate statistical significance of the obtained data, two-tailed Student's t test was performed. Scattering Assay—100,000 RCC-GW cells per well were plated on 6-well plates either in full medium alone or supplemented with 20 ng/ml HGF and 10 ng/ml GDNF, respectively. Cells were incubated for 48–96 h, and scattering was documented using a microscope with digital equipment. Analysis of L1 Shedding—For analysis of L1 release from carcinoma cell lines, the indicated cells were seeded on 10-cm plates and incubated for 5–17 h. Medium was changed and eventually supplemented with either HGF at the indicated concentrations, 50 ng/ml GDNF or 100 μm Genistein, respectively. Medium was collected at the indicated time points and passed to analysis. Cloning of L1 Mutants—The cDNA for human full-length L1 (a gift from Dr. V. Lemmon, University of Miami, FL) was cloned into the EcoRI/XhoI restriction site of pcDNA3.1+ (Invitrogen, Basel, Switzerland). All mutations were introduced in the cDNA of L1 by high fidelity PCR and standard molecular biology techniques (29Sambrook J. Russel D. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 3rd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2001Google Scholar). All PCR products started shortly upstream of the SacI restriction site of the L1 cDNA and ended with a XhoI restriction site after the stop codon of the C terminus or after the stop codon introduced behind Ser1147 for the L1trun mutant, respectively. The point mutation Tyr1229 to His was created by overlap extension. The SacI/XhoI DNA fragment of the L1wt was replaced by mutated SacI/XhoI fragments. All mutations were confirmed by DNA sequencing (Microsynth, Balgach, Switzerland). The sequences of oligonucleotides used for mutagenesis in this study are available on request. Transient DNA Transfection and Analysis of L1 Shedding—Transient DNA transfection was performed as described before (27Grunberg J. Knogler K. Waibel R. Novak-Hofer I. BioTechniques. 2003; 34: 968-972Google Scholar). 293T cells were seeded on 10-cm plates and incubated for 7 h. Transfection was performed using the calcium phosphate method. In brief, 5 μg of cDNA was dissolved in 400 μl of H2O and 61 μl of 2 m CaCl2 were added. The DNA mixture was dropped into 500 μlof2× HBS (HEPES-buffered saline: 50 mm HEPES pH 7.1, 280 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm Na2HPO4), and the calcium phosphate DNA precipitate was allowed to stand at room temperature for 20 min. 10 ml of fresh complete medium was added to the cells before the transfection mixture was added, and cells were incubated overnight. Cells were washed twice with PBS, split into four 6-cm plates and incubated for 24 h. 2 ml of fresh medium was added and either supplemented with 10 ng/ml HGF or 2 μm cytochalasin D, respectively. Cells were incubated for 3 h and medium was collected and filtered through a sterile filter. Immunoprecipitation and analysis of soluble L1 was performed as described before. Expression of L1, c-Met, and c-Ret in Human Renal Carcinoma Cells—To find suitable renal carcinoma cell lines to study the effects of HGF on production of soluble L1, a number of human renal carcinoma cell lines and human embryonic kidney cells were screened for expression of L1, using Western blot analysis with mAb chCE7. Of the 11 tested cell lines 7 were found to express L1, some of them to a high extent (Fig. 1A). In some cell lines, the 140-kDa cleavage product of L1 was found to be associated with full-length L1, as described before by Kalus et al. (7Kalus I. Schnegelsberg B. Seidah N.G. Kleene R. Schachner M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 10381-10388Google Scholar). Renal carcinoma cell lines and embryonic kidney cells (HEK293 and 293T) were then screened by Western blotting for the presence of c-Met and c-Ret to find L1-positive cells which also respond to HGF and GDNF. The extent of c-Met- and c-Ret expression varied widely in different renal carcinoma cell lines (Fig. 1, B and C). In some cells (Fig. 1B, lanes 3, 4, 7, and 8) the 170 kDa proform of c-Met (c-Met pro) could be detected in addition to the 145-kDa β-subunit of mature c-Met (c-Met β), indicating strong overexpression of c-Met in these cell lines. As L1 is known to associate with cytoskeletal proteins through its intracellular domain, we investigated the distribution of L1 between the Triton X-100 soluble and insoluble membrane fractions in Foehn renal carcinoma cells. Immunoprecipitation showed that most of L1 partitions in the Triton X-100-soluble membrane fraction (S) and a smaller amount is present in the insoluble fraction (P), which includes cytoskeletal proteins and lipid rafts (Fig. 1D, lanes 1 and 2). No significant changes in this distribution pattern of L1 could be observed after stimulation of serum-starved Foehn cells with 10 ng/ml HGF for 30 min (Fig. 1D, lanes 3 and 4). Similar to L1, expression of the β-subunit of c-Met in Foehn cells was found to be stronger in the Triton X-100 soluble membrane fraction (S) than in the insoluble fraction (P) whereas the proform of c-Met was shown to be expressed to a similar extent in the soluble and insoluble membrane fraction (Fig. 1E). Effects of HGF and GDNF on Proliferation and Scattering of RCC-GW Cells—In order to test cellular responses to HGF and GDNF, the effect of these factors on proliferation and scattering of the L1- and c-Met/c-Ret receptor-positive cell line RCC-GW was investigated. It is known that serum can mask the proliferative effect of HGF (30Cantley L.G. Barros E.J. Gandhi M. Rauchman M. Nigam S.K. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 267: F271-F280Google Scholar), therefore cell growth was measured in three independent experiments over a time period of 96 h in serum free medium alone or in the presence of 20 ng/ml HGF and 10 ng/ml GDNF, respectively. Fig. 2A shows in a typical experiment that both factors led to a significant increase in cell number, however the effect of GDNF appeared at later times than the effect of HGF. HGF is also known as “scatter factor,” and addition of 20 ng/ml HGF to complete medium led to a strong scattering effect and elongation of RCC-GW cells within 24 h (Fig. 2, B, panel 2), whereas 10 ng/ml GDNF showed no scattering over a time period of 96 h (Fig. 2, B, panel 3). These results show that RCC-GW cells do not only express the HGF and GDNF receptors, but also respond to these growth factors. Influence of Growth Factors on L1 Shedding from Renal Carcinoma Cells—L1 is known to be released from the cell surface of various tumor cell lines due to membrane proximal cleavage by metalloproteases (5Beer S. Oleszewski M. Gutwein P. Geiger C. Altevogt P. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 2667-2675Google Scholar, 7Kalus I. Schnegelsberg B. Seidah N.G. Kleene R. Schachner M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 10381-10388Google Scholar, 31Montgomery A.M. Becker J.C. Siu C.H. Lemmon V.P. Cheresh D.A. Pancook J.D. Zhao X. Reisfeld R.A. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 132: 475-485Google Scholar). To analyze shedding of L1 from the cell surface of renal tumor cells, immunoprecipitation of soluble L1 from cell culture medium with mAb chCE7 followed by immunoblotting with mAb UJ127.11 was performed. RCC-GW cells expressing full-length L1 (200 kDa) were used as a control (Fig. 3, A and B, lane 1). All of the tested cell lines released a 180-kDa form of L1 into the medium (sL1) and the amount of soluble L1 correlated with the extent of L1 expression (Fig. 3A). Shedding of L1 was also observed in the L1-expressing neuroblastoma cell line SK-N-AS. A time course of L1 release from RCC-GW cells showed that when the cells were supplied with fresh culture medium, soluble L1 was faintly detectable in the medium after 1h and shedding increased over 48 h (Fig. 3B). No concomitant decrease in L1 expression on the cell surface was seen over the whole time period (data not shown). To evaluate effects of HGF and GDNF on L1 shedding, RCC-GW cells were stimulated by 100 ng/ml HGF or 50 ng/ml GDNF for 24 h. Addition of HGF to complete medium including 10% FCS strongly stimulated the release of soluble L1 into the medium (Fig. 3C), accompanied by a decrease of cell surface expression of L1 (data not shown). Densitometric analysis of the intensities of the 180-kDa Western blot bands using Aida© software (Raytest GmbH, Straubenhardt, Germany) revealed a 2-fold increase of L1 shedding after HGF stimulation compared with basal levels (n = 3, av = 1.96, S.D. = 0.23, p = 0.02). When GDNF (50 ng/ml) was added to complete medium inhibition of L1 shedding was observed (Fig. 3C). Increasing concentrations of HGF in a range from 1 to 50 ng/ml led to a dose-dependent increase of L1 shedding, with a maximum reached at 5 ng/ml (Fig. 3D), as confirmed by three independent experiments. Basal shedding of L1 was found to be similar in serum free and complete medium (Fig. 3E, lanes 1 and 2), while no stimulation of L1 shedding by HGF in serum-free medium was observed (Fig. 3E, lanes 3 and 4), indicating that components present in the serum are involved in HGF-stimulated shedding of L1 but not in basal L1 release. These results demonstrate, that L1 is shed from the cell surface of renal carcinoma cells and that release of L1 is stimulated by physiological concentrations of HGF but not by GDNF. In order to investigate if shedding of L1 is mediated by tyrosine phosphorylation, we analyzed basal and HGF-stimulated L1 shedding from Foehn cells in the presence of the broad range tyrosine kinase inhibitor Genistein. We found that both basal and HGF-stimulated shedding of L1 was suppressed after addition of 100 μm Genistein for 3 h (Fig. 3F). The inhibition of L1 shedding was not due to a toxic effect on the cells, because cell viability measured by the trypan blue assay after 3 h of incubation with Genistein was found to be similar to that in control cells (85%). These results indicate that protein phosphorylation regulates the release of soluble L1 from the cell surface. Influence of Mutations in the L1 Cytoplasmic Domain on L1 Shedding—We constructed L1 mutants and transiently expressed them in 293T cells (Fig. 4) to address the role of the intracellular domain in L1 shedding. In contrast to HEK293 cells, these cells express replication-competent T antigen, which leads to high expression of transfected L1 mutants and high amounts of soluble L1 in the medium. A first mutant was cloned missing all but 3 amino acids (KRS) of the cytoplasmic domain (L1trun). A second mutant with an exchange of tyrosine 1229 to histidine (L1YH) was generated. This mutation known from the MASA syndrome abolishes the tyrosine phosphorylation-mediated intracellular binding of L1 to ankyrin (32Needham L.K. Thelen K. Maness P.F. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 1490-1500Google Scholar) and enhances lateral motility of L1 (23Gil O.D. Sakurai T. Bradley A.E. Fink M.Y. Cassella M.R. Kuo J.A. Felsenfeld D.P. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 162: 719-730Google Scholar). All L1 mutant proteins were expressed in equal amounts in 293T cells as verified by immunoblotting of cell lysates with mAb UJ127.11 24 h after transfection (Fig. 5A, L1ecto). Analysis of 293T cell lysates with mAb 74–5H7 directed against the cytoplasmic part of L1 revealed strong reactivity with full-length L1 (L1wt) and L1YH (Fig 5A, L1cyto). As expected, no reactivity with L1 lacking the whole intracellular domain (L1trun) was detectable. No endogenous L1 expression was detectable in 293T cells transfected with the vector pcDNA3.1+ (Fig. 5A, lane 1). To"

No functional H2O2-generating system has yet been obtained after transfecting Duox2 into non-thyroid cell lines, because it is retained in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). We investigated the level of maturation of various Duox2 truncated proteins in an attempt to identify the region of Duox2 responsible for its remaining in the ER. Duox2-Q686X mutant, corresponding to the N-terminal ectodomain including the first putative transmembrane domain, was expressed in different cell lines. Carbohydrate content analysis revealed that complex type-specific Golgi apparatus (GA) oligosaccharides were present on pig Duox2-Q686X, whereas human truncated Duox2 carried only high mannose-type sugar chains characteristic of the ER. Further characterization using surface biotinylation and flow cytometry assays indicated that pig Duox2-Q686X was present at the plasma membrane, whereas human Duox2-Q686X remained inside the cell. The replacement of the last 90 residues of the human Duox2-Q686X with the pig equivalent region allowed the chimerical peptide to reach the Golgi apparatus. Pig mutants containing the complete first intracellular loop with or without the second transmembrane domain accumulated in the ER. These findings show that 1) the human Duox2-Q686X region encompassing residues 596–685 prevents mutant exportation from the ER and 2) there is a pig Duox2 retention domain in the first intracellular loop. In addition, missense mutations of four cysteines (Cys-351, -370, -568, or -582) completely inhibited the emergence of pig Duox2-Q686X from the ER compartment, indicating their importance in Duox2 maturation.

This synthesis occurs on the outside of the apical plasma membrane of thyrocytes in the presence of hydrogen peroxide, which acts as an electron acceptor (2Ekholm R. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1981; 24: 141-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). The H2O2-generating system associated with TPO is a calcium-dependent NADPH:O2 oxidoreductase, which has a catalytic core containing a 1548-amino acid integral membrane flavoprotein encoded by the DUOX2 gene (3Dupuy C.

A biallele inactivating mutation on the DUOX2 gene was found in a patient with a total iodide organification defect; this confirmed the essential role of Duox2, probably as a supplier of H2O2 for TPO (6Moreno J.C. Bikker H. Kempers M.J.E. Van Trotsenburg P. Baas F. de Vijlder J.J.M. Vulsma T. Ris-Stalpers C. N. Engl. J. Med. 2002; 347: 95-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar). The DUOX1 gene, situated near DUOX2 on chromosome 15q15, encodes a homologous 1551-amino acid protein displaying 83% sequence similarity (5De Deken X. Wang D. Many M.C. Costagliola S. Libert F.

DUOX mRNAs are also detected in epithelial cells of some secretory glands and mucosal surfaces, where these enzymes could provide H2O2 for peroxidase-mediated antimicrobial defense processes (7Dupuy C.

The Duox glycoprotein sequence can be divided into three parts, each extending over about one-third of the molecule (Fig. 1). The C-terminal region, comprising the last six TMDs of Duox, displays high sequence similarities with the other members of the NAD(P)H oxidase family (9Lambeth J.D. Cheng G. Arnold R.S. Edens W.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 459-461Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar), indicating that it probably catalyzes the transfer of electrons across the membrane from NADPH to molecular oxygen. The large intracellular loop located in the middle part of Duox, between the first two TMDs, contains two potential calcium EF-hand binding motifs and is probably involved in the control by calcium of the conformation and activity of NADPH oxidase (10Leseney A.M.

However, the role of the homologous domain of Duox2 in thyroid hormone biosynthesis is still poorly understood, and its peroxidase activity apparently duplicates that of TPO. The sequence of porcine Duox2 includes six putative N-glycosylated sites located in the N-terminal ectodomain, whereas only five such sites have been identified in the human protein. Western blots of membrane proteins from human and pig thyrocytes displayed Duox2 as two bands corresponding to two differently N-glycosylated states of Duox2 with oligosaccharide motifs accounting for 15 and 25 kDa of their molecular mass, respectively (13Morand S.

Only the more highly glycosylated form was resistant to endoglycosidase H treatment, indicating that it passes through the GA and also suggesting that it constitutes the mature form of the NAD(P)H oxidase at the plasma membrane (14De Deken X.

No reconstitution of a functional H2O2-generating system based on Duox1 or Duox2 proteins has yet been achieved. Human Duox expressed in CHO and COS cells remains exclusively intracellular, with no post-ER maturation (14De Deken X. Wang D. Dumont J.E. Miot F. Exp.

Cell Res. 2002; 273: 187-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). To explore this latter possibility, we expressed C-terminal-deleted mutants of human and porcine Duox2 in Hek293, CHO, and PCCL3 cells. The first mutants, termed human and pig Duox2-Q686X, respectively, included the peroxidase-like ectodomain and the first TMD (Figs. 1 and 2). This exactly matched the truncated protein probably expressed in the thyroid of a patient with the C2056T monoallelic mutation on the DUOX2 gene and exhibiting a partial iodide-organification defect phenotype (6Moreno J.C. Bikker H. Kempers M.J.E. Van Trotsenburg P. Baas F. de Vijlder J.J.M. Vulsma T. Ris-Stalpers C. N. Engl. J. Med. 2002; 347: 95-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar). The other mutants used were the longer porcine Duox2-H1038X and Duox2-V1075X proteins, truncated before and after the second TMD, respectively (Fig. 1). In this study, we investigated the maturation of these mutants in terms of their N-glycosylation states and subcellular localization. The role of the cysteine residues located in the ectodomain was also investigated in the intracellular trafficking using site-directed mutagenesis. Generation of Duox2 Constructs—Human and pig DUOX2 open reading frame cDNAs were amplified by RT-PCR using 1 μg of human or pig thyroid mRNA with primers designed according to the GenBank™ data base (NM_014080 and AF547267 for human and pig DUOX2 cDNA, respectively). Human and pig DUOX2 products (4.6 kb) were cloned into pcDNA3.1D/TOPO vectors (Invitrogen) and sequenced. Human and pig Duox2-Q686X were amplified by PCR using these plasmids. The sense PCR primers used for human and pig Duox2 constructs included the ATG start codon followed by 27 nucleotides. The antisense PCR primers for human and pig Duox2-Q686X were 5′-CTAGACCACACGGAGCACAGTGAGATGCCT-3′, and 5′-CTAGATGGTAC GGAGCACTGAGAGATGCCT-3′, respectively, where the bold letters correspond to the stop codon. Human and pig Duox2-Q686X products (2.0 kb) were also cloned into pcDNA3.1D/TOPO vectors (Invitrogen) and sequenced. To generate stable cell lines using the Flp-In™ system (Invitrogen), human and pig Duox2-Q686X inserts were subcloned into pcDNA5/FRT, using KpnI/NotI. Human and pig Duox2-(1–685) fused in-frame with green fluorescent protein (GFP) were produced by PCR using human and pig pcDNA3.1D/Duox2 plasmids as templates. The antisense PCR primers for human and pig Duox2·GFP were 5′-CGACCACACGGAGCACAGTGAGATG-3′ and 5′-CGATGGTAC GGAGCACTGAGAGATG-3′, respectively. The PCR products were cloned into pcDNA3.1/CT·GFP-TOPO vector (Invitrogen) and sequenced. Pig Duox2-H1038X and pig Duox2-V1075X fragments were amplified by PCR using pig pcDNA3.1D/Duox2 plasmid with the antisense primer 5′-TCACCGCCGAT AATTCTCCACAAAGCGCTTGTA-3′ and 5′-TCAAAAGGGGTCTCTGCAATGCCCGAGGG-3′, respectively. The fragments were cloned into pcDNA3.1D/TOPO vector and sequenced. The chimerical construct coding the first 595 amino acids of the human Duox2 followed by amino acids 596–685 of the pig Duox2 was obtained by overlapping PCR using human and pig pcDNA3.1D/Duox2 plasmids as templates (15Klug J. Wolf M. Beato M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 2793Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). The sense and antisense primers used to amplify the human Duox2-(1–595) sequence were 5′-CCCAAGCTTATGCTCCGTGCAAGACCAGAGGCACTGATG-3′ (primer 1, containing a HindIII restriction site and the start codon) and 5′-TACGATGGTGATGCCAAAACCGGGGCTGCTGCCTTCAAAGAAGTCAAG-3′ (primer 2), respectively. The sense and antisense primers used to amplify the pig Duox2-(596–685) sequence were 5′-CCGCTCGAGTCAGATGGTACGGAGCACTGAGAGATGCCT-3′ (primer 3, containing a XhoI restriction site and the stop codon) and 5′-CTTGACTTCTTTGAAGGCAGCAGCCCCGGTTTTGGCATCACCATCGTA-3′ (primer 4), respectively. The PCR products (1.8 and 0.2 kb, respectively) were purified, mixed together, and submitted to a 15-cycle PCR without adding primers and then to a 30-cycle PCR with primers 1 and 3. The PCR fusion product (2.0 kb) was then digested by HindIII/XhoI, cloned into pcDNA5/FRT plasmid, and sequenced. Cysteines in pig Duox2-Q686X were replaced by glycines by site-directed mutagenesis using the QuikChange kit (Stratagene). Primers containing the desired mutation and the PCR conditions were selected according to the manufacturer's guidelines. Cell Cultures, Transfection, and Preparation of the Particulate Fraction—Rat thyroid cells (PCCL3), developed as described previously (16Fusco A. Berlingieri M.T. Di Fiore P.P. Portella G. Grieco M. Vecchio G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 3365-3370Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar), were a generous gift from Dr. R. Di Lauro (Stazione Zoologica Anton Dohrn, Napoli, Italy). They were cultured in Coon's modified Ham's F12 medium (VWR) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 10 microunits of bovine thyrotropin (Sigma), 1 μg/ml insulin, 5 μg/ml transferrin, and 10 nm hydrocortisone. Flp-In™ CHO and Flp-In™ Hek293 cell lines (Invitrogen) were grown at 37 °C in Ham's F-12 medium (Invitrogen) and in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen), respectively, supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, antibiotics, and Zeocin™. When they reached 50–60% confluence, the cells were transiently transfected by using the FuGENE (Roche Applied Sciences) transfection reagent. After 24 h, 20 μm hemin and 10 mm sodium butyrate were added to the medium; the PCCL3 cells were also supplemented with 10 μm forskolin. After 48 h, cells were washed with PBS and scraped into the same solution supplemented with a mixture of protease inhibitors (5 μg/ml aprotinin, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, 157 μg/ml benzamidine). After centrifuging at 200 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, the cell pellet was homogenized using a motor-driven Teflon pestle homogenizer in 2 ml of 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer containing 0.25 m sucrose, 0.1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm EGTA (pH 7.2) and the mixture of protease inhibitors. After centrifuging at 3,000 × g for 30 min, the pellet was resuspended in 0.5 ml of 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.2) containing 0.25 m sucrose, 1 mm MgCl2, and the mixture of protease inhibitors. Deglycosylation Experiments—Deglycosylation was performed as follows: 100 μg of particulate fraction was treated either in 50 mm phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) containing the antiprotease mixture, 2.5 mm EDTA, 0.1% SDS, before adding 50 units/ml N-glycosidase F (Roche Applied Sciences) or in 100 mm sodium citrate buffer, (pH 5.5) containing the antiprotease mixture, 2.5 mm EDTA, 0.1% SDS, before adding 1 unit/ml Endoglycosidase H (Roche Applied Sciences). After a 1-h incubation, an additional 50 units/ml N-glycosidase F or 1 unit/ml endoglycosidase H was added, and the incubation was continued for a further 1 h. Controls were performed under the same conditions except that deglycosylation enzymes were omitted. The reaction was stopped by adding concentrated Laemmli sample buffer before performing electrophoresis. Western Blot Analysis—SDS-PAGE and immunoblot analyses were performed as described previously (17Caillou B. Dupuy C. Lacroix L. Nocera M. Talbot M. Ohayon R. Deme D. Bidart J.M. Schlumberger M. Virion A. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 2001; 86: 3351-3358PubMed Google Scholar). The Duox2 protein was detected using the polyclonal IgG antipeptide raised against the 14-amino acid peptide encompassing the Leu-410-Thr-423 portion of human and porcine Duox2. This antipeptide does not detect rat Duox2 protein. Cell Surface Biotinylation—Flp-In™ Hek293 and Flp-In™ CHO cells were stably transfected with pig and human pcDNA5/FRT-Duox2-Q686X, respectively, and clones were selected in a hygromycin-B-supplemented culture medium. Resistant clones were screened for positive Duox2-Q686X expression by Western blot analysis. Cell monolayers grown in 35-mm Petri dishes were washed twice with ice-cold PBS (pH 8.0) supplemented with 1 mm CaCl2 and 1 mm MgCl2 (PBS-CM) before sulfo-NHS-biotin (Pierce) was added at the concentration of 0.5 mg/ml in PBS-CM for 10 min on ice. Control cells were treated without sulfo-NHS-biotin. The reagent was removed, and the same operation was repeated once. The medium was then removed, and the remaining reactive sulfo-NHS-biotin was blocked by adding 50 mm NH4Cl in PBS-CM. The cells were then washed with PBS-CM before adding 600 μl of solubilization buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 10 mm CHAPS, and the antiprotease mixture. Cells were incubated for 30 min on ice while being gently shaken and then centrifuged for 30 min at 200,000 × g. The supernatant was incubated for 2 h with 200 μl of avidin-agarose (Sigma). The biotinylated surface Duox2-Q686X and the intracellular Duox2-Q686X were separated by centrifuging (1 min, 9,000 × g). The beads were washed seven times at 4 °C with extraction buffer and twice with PBS-CM, resuspended in 100 μl of Laemmli sample buffer, and boiled for 5 min. 50 μl of the supernatant corresponding to the cell surface fraction and 5 μl of the supernatant corresponding to the intracellular fraction were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblot. Fluorescence-activated Cell Sorter Analysis—Flp-In™ Hek293 and Flp-In™ CHO cells stably expressing pig and human Duox2-Q686X, respectively, were washed with PBS and detached from the plates using PBS containing 5 mm EDTA and 5 mm EGTA for 10 min at 37 °C before being transferred into polypropylene tubes (107 cells/tube). Cells were washed three times with PBS and centrifuged at 200 × g for 5 min at room temperature; the supernatant was then removed by inversion. Cells were then incubated at 4 °C with 2 ml of complete culture medium. After 1 h, they were washed with PBS and centrifuged at 400 × g for 3 min. They were then incubated for 45 min at 4 °C with 400 μl of complete culture medium containing 8 μl of antipeptide. Cells were washed three times with PBS and centrifuged as above. They were then incubated for 30 min at 4 °C in the dark with fluorescein-conjugated F(ab′)2 goat anti-rabbit IgG (H+L) (Caltag) in the same buffer. Cells were washed three times as above and resuspended in 400 μl of PBS. Controls were done using wild type Flp-In™ Hek293 and Flp-In™ CHO cells. The fluorescence was assayed by fluorescence-activated cell sorter using an Epics Elite cytometer (Coulter). Confocal Microscopy—Flp-In™ Hek293 and Flp In™ CHO cells transiently transfected with human and pig pcDNA3.1Duox2-(1–685)-CT·GFP were grown on a coverslip (Superior) and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde at room temperature during 10 min. Cells were then washed twice for 5 min with PBS at room temperature and mounted in Mowiol. Cells were viewed with a ZEISS-LSM 510 laser scanning confocal microscope using a ×63/1.4 NA oil immersion objective lens. GFP was excited at 488 nm, and fluorescence emission was detected using a 505-nm-long pass filter. The pinhole was set at one Airy unit. Expression and Deglycosylation Studies of Human and Pig Duox2-Q686X in Hek293, CHO, and PCCL3 Cell Lines—Two non-thyroid cell lines (Hek293 and CHO) and a rat thyroid cell line (PCCL3) were transiently transfected with expression vectors encoding the human or pig Duox2-Q686X mutant. During the transfection period, the medium was supplemented with hemin because heme incorporation might affect flavoprotein maturation processing as previously reported for TPO and Nox2 (18Fayadat L.

Membrane proteins were then analyzed by Western blot, and human truncated Duox2 was visualized as a single immunoreactive band with an apparent molecular mass of 85 kDa (Fig. 3, lanes H). Surprisingly, the polyclonal antipeptide immunodetected the pig Duox2-Q686X protein as a doublet (Fig. 3, lanes P). One band had the same apparent molecular mass of 85-kDa as the human mutant, but a second protein was revealed as a broad band of ∼100 kDa. Each band could correspond to a specific glycosylation state of the protein, as previously observed for the full-length Duox2 (13Morand S. Chaaraoui M. Kaniewski J. Deme D. Ohayon R. Noel-Hudson M.S. Virion A. Dupuy C. Endocrinology. 2003; 144: 1241-1248Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Indeed, the calculated molecular mass of Duox2-Q686X mutants is only 70 kDa, but they contain all the putative N-glycosylation sites of human and porcine Duox2, numbering five and six sites, respectively. Deglycosylation experiments were therefore performed to check this assumption. The particulate fractions were digested with N-glycosidase F (NGaseF) or endoglycosidase H (EndoH) and analyzed by Western blot. The treatment with NGaseF or EndoH of Hek293, CHO, and PCCL3 particulate fractions expressing human Duox2-Q686X shifted the 85-kDa form to a 70-kDa protein with the predicted molecular mass of the non-glycosylated protein (Fig. 4, A–C). The NGaseF treatment of protein extracts from Hek293, CHO, and PCCL3 cells expressing the pig Duox2-Q686X mutant converted the doublet into a single band, reducing the apparent molecular mass of the 85 and 100-kDa forms by 15 and 25 kDa, respectively (Fig. 4, D–F, lanes F). However, the 100-kDa form of pig Duox2-Q686X was not affected by digestion with EndoH, whereas the 85-kDa protein was still converted into the 70-kDa form (Fig. 4, C–E, lanes H). Taken together, these findings indicate that the glycosylation of pig truncated Duox2 protein passed through the GA, unlike the corresponding human protein, which exhibited only ER-specific oligosaccharide motifs.Fig. 4Analysis of the glycosylation states of human and pig Duox2-Q686X mutants. Flp-In™ Hek293 (A–D), Flp-In™ CHO (B–E), and PCCL3 (C–F) cells were transiently transfected for 48 h with human (A–C) or pig (D–F) pcDNA3.1D/Duox2-Q686X, and the particulate fractions of the cells were treated with or without (–) N-glycosidase F (F) or endoglycosidase H (H) as described under “Experimental Procedures.”View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Cell Surface Expression of Duox2-Q686X Mutants—The differences observed in the glycosylation states of the human and porcine mutants might reflect differing subcellular distributions of the proteins. In particular, the evidence for a GA-specific glycosylation of the pig protein suggested that it could be targeted to the plasma membrane. Cell surface biotinylation experiments, carried out with a non-permeable reagent, were performed on the Hek293 and CHO cell lines stably expressing pig and human Duox2-Q686X mutants, respectively. Sulfo-NHS-biotin treatment revealed that a fraction of the porcine mutant 100-kDa form was present at the cell surface, whereas the partially glycosylated protein could not be biotinylated (Fig. 5A). Fig. 5B shows the human Duox2-Q686X 85-kDa protein was not expressed at the plasma membrane. The presence of the Duox2-Q686X protein at the plasma membrane was also measured by flow cytometry analysis. Fig. 6A demonstrates the binding of the antipeptide to the plasma membrane of nonpermeabilized cells expressing pig Duox2-Q686X, whereas no such fluorescence intensity shift was observed with human Duox2-Q686X (Fig. 6B). Duox2-(1–685)-CT·GFP fusion protein expressed for 48 h in both cell lines also provided evidence of a species-dependent subcellular distribution of each protein. Again, the porcine fusion protein expressed in Hek293 and CHO cells was detected in the Western blot experiment as a doublet, whereas the human tagged protein appeared as a single immunoreactive band (data not shown). When analyzed by confocal microscopy, the porcine fusion protein was found at the cell plasma membrane (Fig. 7, A and B), but we also observed intracellular fluorescence on other cellular sections. The human GFP-tagged mutant was visualized only as intracellular spots (Fig. 7, C and D).Fig. 6Flow cytometric analysis of the cell surface expression of human and pig Duox2-Q686X mutants.

Hek293 cells stably expressing the human Duox2-Q686X mutant were therefore treated for 24 h with a specific proteasome inhibitor, the MG132 compound, to test the involvement of the ubiquitin/proteasome system in the rapid degradation of the human mature Duox2 form. Western blot analysis revealed no novel band over the ER-specific 85-kDa form but rather an increased amount of the unglycosylated human Duox2-Q686X protein (data not shown) A chimerical gene was constructed by fusing in-frame the human DUOX2 cDNA sequence coding the N-terminal ectodomain with the pig DUOX2 cDNA sequence coding from the first TMD to amino acid 685 (Fig. 8A). This construct was transiently expressed in Hek293 cells for 48 h. Membrane proteins were then submitted to Western blot analysis. The antipeptide antibody revealed the chimerical peptide as a doublet: one band had the same apparent molecular mass of 85 kDa as the human Duox2-Q686X mutant, but a second protein with a higher molecular mass was visualized under 100 kDa (Fig. 8B). Deglycosylation experiments demonstrated that this latter form had passed through the GA because the N-linked oligosaccharides were not affected by the endoglycosidase H treatment (Fig. 8C).

AdoMetDC catalyzes the removal of the carboxylate group from S-adenosylmethionine (AdoMet) to form S-adenosyl-5′-(3-methylthiopropylamine) (dcAdoMet), which is committed to act as the n-propylamine group donor for the synthesis of the polyamines spermine and spermidine from the diamine putrescine. AdoMetDC is a crucial control point within the polyamine pathway and its activity is highly regulated during the cell cycle. These polyamines have been shown to be involved in the initiation and maintenance of proliferative states and are essential for cell growth and differentiation (4Pegg A.E. Biochem. J. 1986; 234: 249-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (1424) Google Scholar, 5Wallace H.M. Fraser A.V. Hughes A. Biochem. J. 2003; 376: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (758) Google Scholar). AdoMetDC belongs to a small class of decarboxylating enzymes that use a covalently bound pyruvate as a prosthetic group rather than the cofactor pyridoxal 5′-phosphate (PLP) typically employed in amino acid decarboxylation reactions (6van Poelje P.D. Snell E.E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1990; 59: 29-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar, 7Hackert M.L. Pegg A.E. Sinnott M.L. Comprehensive Biological Catalysis. Academic Press, London1997: 201-216Google Scholar). All AdoMetDCs currently characterized are pyruvoyl enzymes but they can be divided into two classes. Class 1 enzymes are present in bacteria and Archaea, and class 2 enzymes are present in Eukarya (see Table I for representative members of each class). Formation of the active enzyme in both cases involves a self-maturation process in which the active site pyruvoyl group is generated from an internal serine residue via an autocatalytic post-translational modification. Two non-identical subunits are generated from the proenzyme in this reaction, and the pyruvate is formed at the N terminus of the α-subunit, which is derived from the carboxyl end of the proenzyme. The post-translation cleavage follows an unusual pathway, termed nonhydrolytic serinolysis, in which the side chain hydroxyl group of the serine supplies its oxygen atom to form the C terminus of the β-chain, while the remainder of the serine residue is converted to ammonia and the pyruvoyl group blocking the N terminus of the α-chain. Although all AdoMet-DCs undergo the same self-maturation process, the class 1 and class 2 enzymes have almost no detectable sequence homology, and they do not share similarity to any of the other known pyruvoyl-dependent amino acid decarboxylases.Table IRepresentative AdoMetDCsSourceProenzymeResidues in α-subunitaNot including the pyruvate at its N terminusResidues in β-subunitOligomer structureSequence at cleavage sitebThe serine that forms the pyruvate is shown in bold textkDaClass IAE. coli30152111(αβ)4VVAHLDKS112HICVHC. acetobutylicum32155118Not knownVLAHLDKS119HITVHClass IBT. maritima156762(αβ)2GVVVISES63HLTIHM. jannaschii146063(αβ)2GVAVLAES64HIAIHB. subtilis146264Not knownGVVIISES65HLTIHClass IIHuman3826667(αβ)2EAYVLSES68SMFVSPotato4028772αβDSYVLSES73SLFVYT. cruzi4228485Not knownRSYVLTES86SLFVMYeast4630887Not knownDAFLLSES88SLFVFa Not including the pyruvate at its N terminusb The serine that forms the pyruvate is shown in bold text Open table in a new tab The class 1 AdoMetDCs can be further divided into two groups.

This class forms an (αβ)2 dimer and does not require Mg2+ or other activators. Class 1A and 1B enzymes show low levels of sequence similarity. These similarities are evident in the residues surrounding the probable cleavage site and those surrounding a cysteine residue, which was identified as part of the active site from modifications that occur during substrate-mediated inactivation of the E. coli and Salmonella typhimurium enzymes (9Diaz E.

The three-dimensional structure of the human AdoMetDC demonstrated that its active site is located far from the interface between the two αβ protomers and that it utilizes residues from both the α- and β-chains (18Ekstrom J.E.

The topology of each αβ protomer showed an internal structural duplication in which residues 4–164, which contain the pyruvoyl group, and residues 172–329 have similar topologies. The two halves of the human AdoMetDC protomer are similar in size to the class 1 protomer; however, this is the only indication that the two classes of pyruvoyl-dependent AdoMetDC might be structurally homologous. Here we report the structures of the wild-type proenzyme and S63A mutant of a class 1B AdoMetDC from T. maritima determined to 1.55 and 1.7 Å resolution, respectively, using selenomethionine multiwavelength anomalous diffraction (MAD) phasing methods. The class 1B TmAdoMetDC structure provides striking evidence of an ancient gene duplication event resulting in the class 2 AdoMetDC enzymes. TmAdoMetDC is synthesized as a 14.8 kDa proenzyme, which after processing contains two chains, β and α, of molecular mass 7.0 and 7.8 kDa, respectively. The active form of TmAdoMetDC is an (αβ)2 dimer. Each protomer contains one active site that occurs at the dimer interface and also requires residues from the adjacent protomer. Several key active site residues involved in substrate binding, catalysis, or proenzyme processing that were identified in the human and potato class 2 AdoMetDCs are readily recognized in the class 1B TmAdoMetDC despite the overall low primary sequence homology. A sequence alignment of EcAdoMetDC with TmAdoMetDC shows 13% identity. Homology modeling was carried out for the core structure of EcAdoMetDC based on the limited sequence homology and a structural superposition of the T. maritima and human AdoMetDCs. Cloning of T. maritima speD—PCR was performed using T. maritima genomic DNA (purchased from ATCC) as the template with the following primer pair: TmSpeDF: TAG TAG CAT ATG AAG AGT CTG GGA AGG CAC (inserts an NdeI site at the start of the gene) and TmSpeDR: TAG TAG CTC GAG TCA GAC GGC GGC CTT GTG CGG (inserts an XhoI site after the stop codon of the gene). The amplified PCR product was purified (QIAquick PCR purification kit from Qiagen), and ligated into pET-28a. A representative clone was sequenced and named pTmSpeD.28. Mutagenesis of T. maritima speD—Site-directed mutagenesis with the QuikChange kit was performed according to the manufacturer's guidelines. The following complementary primer pair was used: TmS-peDSAF: GGT GGT GAT ATC TGA AGC TCA CCT AAC CAT TCA CAC CTG GCC and TmSpeDSAR: GGC CAG GTG TGA ATG GTT AGG TGA GCT TCA GAT ATC ACC ACC. Clones were screened by restriction digest for the introduction of an AluI site. A representative clone with the correct restriction pattern was sequenced and named pTmSpeD.28 S63A. Protein Expression and Purification—For the production of native S63A protein, the pTmSpeD.28 S63A plasmid was transformed into the BL21Star(DE3)pRare strain of E. coli (Invitrogen). A 5-ml saturated starter culture was used to inoculate 1 liter of LB supplemented with 15 μg/ml chloramphenicol and 30 μg/ml kanamycin. The cells were grown at 37 °C until they reached an OD600 of 0.4, at which point the temperature was shifted to 15 °C. The cells were induced with 1 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactoside (IPTG) at an OD600 of ∼0.6. After induction for 16 h the cells were spun down at 5,000 rpm for 10 min and stored at -80 °C. For production of the S63A TmAdoMetDC mutant protein with selenomethionine (SeMet) incorporated, the methionine auxotrophic strain of E. coli, B834(DE3) (Novagen), was transformed with pTm-SpeD.28 S63A. The growth medium contained M9 salts supplemented with all amino acids (40 μg/ml each) except l-methionine, which was replaced with l-SeMet, 0.4% (w/v) glucose, 2 mm MgSO4, 25 μg/ml FeSO4·7H2O,1mm CaCl2,35 μg/ml kanamycin, and a 1% BME vitamin solution (Invitrogen). The cells from the initial 5-ml starter culture were washed with the above medium, and used to start a 1-liter culture. This culture was grown to an OD600 ∼0.6, at which point the temperature was lowered to 25 °C, and the cells were induced with 500 μm IPTG. After induction for 5 h, the cells were spun down and stored at -80 °C. For production of the TmAdoMetDC proenzyme, pTmSpeD.28 was transformed into the B834(DE3) strain of E. coli (Novagen). The cells were grown using LB media supplemented with 35 μg/ml kanomycin. The remainder of the growth protocol was as described for the SeMet S63A protein. All purification steps were carried out at room temperature. The cells were resuspended in 35 ml of binding buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 10 mm imidazole, 500 mm NaCl) and lysed using a French press. The crude extract was centrifuged, and the resulting supernatant was stirred for 1 h with 1.5 ml of Ni-NTA beads (Novagen) equilibrated with the binding buffer. The resin was then loaded into a polypropylene column and washed with binding buffer (100 ml) followed by 50 ml of wash buffer (50 mm Tris HCl, pH 8.0, 35 mm imidazole, 500 mm NaCl). S63A AdoMetDC was eluted from the column with 15 ml of elution buffer (50 mm Tris HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm imidazole, 500 mm NaCl). After dialysis with 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0 and 1 mm dithiothreitol, the protein was concentrated to 6 mg/ml, frozen, and stored at -80 °C. The purification protocol for the wild-type TmAdoMetDC was as described for the S63A protein. The wild-type TmAdoMetDC was found to be greater than 95% unprocessed as determined by Coomassie-stained SDS-PAGE (data not shown). Processing of TmAdoMetDC—The proenzyme derived from the Tm-speD gene was synthesized in vitro using the Promega TnT system (catalog L4610). Protein was translated from the pTmSpeD.28 or the same plasmid carrying mutants of TmSpeD (S55A, S63A, H68A, or C83A). The TnT reaction was carried out at 30 °C for 1 h according to manufacturer's instructions with 1 μg of DNA used/50 μl of reaction. Processing was then induced by heating at 65 °C. Aliquots of 5 μl of the TnT reaction product were diluted with 10 μl of 0.075 m sodium phosphate buffer, pH 6.8, and the tubes were transferred to a heat block pre-equilibrated to 65 °C. At the end of the desired processing time, 15 μl of Tricine gel loading buffer (4% SDS, 12% glycerol, 2% β-mercaptoethanol, 50 mm Tris, 0.01% Coomassie Brilliant Blue G) was added to each tube to stop the reaction, and the tube was placed on ice. As soon as the tube had cooled, it was placed at -20 °C. When all samples had been obtained, the samples were thawed, boiled 5 min, microcentrifuged briefly, and loaded onto 12% Tricine gels. Gels were run at 45 mA/gel and stopped when the dye front was just at the bottom of the gel. Gels were then fixed in 10% acetic acid, 30% MeOH in H2O. Fixative was changed twice at 15-min intervals and then gels were left overnight (12–16 h) in fixative on a gently rocking platform. After fixing, the gels were dried on a gel drier for 2–2.5 h at 80 °C and then placed on a phosphorimager screen for visualization. Visualization was carried out on a Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager 595, and quantitation was done with ImageQuant software. In some experiments, at the end of the 65 °C incubation to induce processing, the tube was cooled and 15 μl of 1 m hydroxylamine hydrochloride was added. The sample was then incubated at 37 °C for the specified time, and the gel-loading buffer was added at the end of the 37 °C incubation. Crystallization—Small initial crystals of the native S63A TmAdoMetDC were obtained using the Crystal Screen™ sparse matrix kit (22Jancarik J. Kim S.H. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1991; 24: 409-411Crossref Scopus (2076) Google Scholar). The optimized crystallization conditions were found to be 2.0–2.4 m ammonium formate, 100 mm HEPES, pH 8.0, using the hanging-drop method at room temperature. Crystals appeared after 2 weeks and reached their maximum size of 0.15 mm × 0.1 mm × 0.1 mm within 6 weeks. The best SeMet-S63A protein crystals grew under similar conditions with an alkaline shift to pH 8.6 and an increase in precipitant concentration to 3.2 m. Under these conditions S63A TmAdoMetDC crystallizes in the trigonal space group R3 with unit cell dimensions of a = 104.97 Å and c = 69.52 Å. Each asymmetric unit contains a complete dimer with a solvent content of 52%. Crystals of the wild-type TmAdoMetDC proenzyme were obtained under similar conditions to the S63A mutant TmAdoMetDC. The protein concentration was 5 mg/ml, and the optimized well solution contained 3.2 m ammonium formate and 100 mm HEPES, pH 7.8. For cryoprotection, the crystals were transferred to a stabilization solution similar to the mother liquor, but with the ammonium formate concentration increased by 200 mm. The stabilization solution was gradually replaced with a cryoprotectant solution containing increasing concentrations of glycerol (5% steps until the final concentration of 20% was reached). The crystals were frozen by plunging them into liquid nitrogen and stored for later use. Data Collection and Processing—The diffraction experiments were performed at beamline 8-BM at the Advanced Photon Source using a Quantum 315 detector in binned format. A three-wavelength data set was collected to 2.1 Å resolution on the SeMet-S63A TmAdoMetDC. Following calibration of the beam using a Se foil, a fluorescence scan was taken on a SeMet-TmAdoMetDC crystal. For data collection, one wavelength was chosen at the maximum of f ′ (edge), another was chosen at the maximum of f ″ (peak) and a high energy remote wave-length was chosen 200 eV above the edge. Data were collected over 120° using 15 s for each 1° oscillation with a crystal to detector distance of 280 mm. Bijvoet pairs were measured after each 40° wedge using inverse beam geometry. A native S63A data set was collected over a range of 180° using 40 s for each 1° oscillation at a crystal to detector distance of 220 mm. A wild-type proenzyme data set was collected over a range of 120° using a 17 s exposure time for each 0.5° oscillation at a crystal to detector distance of 200 mm. The HKL2000 suite (23Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref Scopus (38253) Google Scholar) of programs was used for integration and scaling of all data sets. The data collection statistics are summarized in Table II. Ambiguity in space group assignment between R3 and R32 indicated a potential twinning problem. Cumulative intensity distribution analysis and analysis of second moments indicated twinning for all data sets. The merohedral twin fraction was estimated at 0.25, 0.42, and 0.28, respectively, for the native S63A, SeMet-S63A, and wild-type proenzyme TmAdoMetDC data sets using the twinning server (24Yeates T.O.

Berendzen J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 1999; 55: 849-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (3216) Google Scholar) with untreated twinned MAD data to 2.7 Å resolution. The initial phases from SOLVE were improved by density modification using RESOLVE (25Terwilliger T. Berendzen J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 1999; 55: 849-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (3216) Google Scholar) yielding an overall figure of merit of 0.72. Model Building and Structure Refinement—All model building was performed using the computer graphics program O (26Jones T.A. Zou J.-Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (12999) Google Scholar). The two monomers of the S63A dimer were built by tracing a polyalanine model through clear stretches of backbone density. From the initial model an approximate 2-fold non-crystallographic symmetry (NCS) axis was identified. The map was further improved through NCS averaging and density modification with a protein mask that was created from residues 10–115 and 170–285 of the human AdoMetDC using CNS (27Brünger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16919) Google Scholar). The modified map showed improved connectivity and clear side chain electron density, which allowed the sequence alignment and connectivity to be deciphered. However, several segments of the protein were missing in the experimental electron density; the initial model was about 75% complete. Refinement of the initial model against the 1.7 Å native data set was carried out in CNS using the protocols for twinned data. The refinement procedure involved successive rounds of simulated annealing refinement, temperature factor refinement, and model rebuilding. The S63A structure minus water molecules and three residues before and after the site of pyruvate formation was used as the molecular replacement model for the wild-type proenzyme structure. Molecular replacement was carried out in CNS (27Brünger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M.

The S68A human AdoMetDC structure (PDB code 1MSV) was separated into two templates corresponding to the N- and C-terminal domains. The highest sequence similarity with EcAdoMetDC was 19% for the TmAdoMetDC sequence (13% identity). The β-sheet domains of the TmAdoMetDC and the N- and C-terminal halves of the S68A human AdoMetDC were structurally superimposed using LSQ (28Kleywegt G.J. Jones T.A. Macromol. Crystallogr., Pt.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4673-4680Crossref PubMed Scopus (54908) Google Scholar). The sequence alignment of the three templates with EcAdoMetDC were manually adjusted based on the structural superposition. Ten homology models were built from the three template structures using Modeler version 6 (30Sali A. Blundell T.L. J. Mol.

An EcAdoMetDC dimer was built by superimposing the monomer homology model on the TmAdoMetDC dimer. Overall Structure—The structure of the TmAdoMetDC S63A non-processing mutant was solved by MAD phasing using Se-Met-containing crystals. The wild-type proenzyme structure was solved by molecular replacement. Both the proenzyme and the S63A mutant crystallize in the trigonal space group R3 with unit cell dimensions a = 104.9 Å and c = 69.5 Å. The asymmetric unit contains one complete dimer with overall dimensions of ∼42 Å × 33 Å × 25 Å. Crystallographic data and refinement statistics are shown in Tables II and III.

https://openalex.org/W1979969648,"The SeqA protein regulates chromosome initiation and is involved in segregation in Escherichia coli. One SeqA protein binds to two hemi-methylated GATC sequences to form a stable SeqA-DNA complex. We found that binding induced DNA bending, which was pronounced when the two sequences were on the same face of the DNA. Two SeqA molecules bound cooperatively to each pair of hemi-methylated sites when the spacing between the sites was <30 bp. This cooperative binding was able to stabilize the binding of a wild type to a single hemi-methylated site, or mutant form of SeqA protein to hemi-methylated sites, although such binding did not occur without cooperative interaction. Two cooperatively bound SeqA molecules interacted with another SeqA bound up to 185 bp away from the two bound SeqA proteins, and this was followed by aggregation of free SeqA proteins onto the bound proteins. These results suggest that the stepwise interaction of SeqA proteins with hemi-methylated GATC sites enhances their interaction and leads to the formation of SeqA aggregates. Cooperative interaction followed by aggregation may be the driving force for formation of the SeqA foci that appear to be located behind replication forks.

Cooperative interaction followed by aggregation may be the driving force for formation of the SeqA foci that appear to be located behind replication forks. The adenine residues of GATC sequences in Escherichia coli are methylated on their 6 amino group by Dam methyltransferase (1Geier G.E. Modrich P. J. Biol.

Upon replication, the GATC sequences on the newly replicated strand remain transiently unmethylated, leading to a hemi-methylated state of the DNA duplex. The new strand is subsequently methylated by Dam, and the duplex becomes methylated on both strands.

The hemimethylated state of the replicated oriC is maintained for about one-third of the cell cycle, whereas it persists in other chromosomal regions for at most 2 min. Further, the asynchronous and overinitiation of chromosomal replication characteristic of seqA mutants indicates that SeqA is a negative modulator of chromosomal initiation at oriC (5Lu M.

Together with DNA gyrase, it also removes the positive supercoils that accumulate in front of replication forks and growing mRNA transcripts. SeqA has been shown to promote the relaxation and decatenating activity of topoisomerase IV (13Kang S. Han J.S. Park J.H. Skarstad K. Hwang D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 48779-48785Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). This appears to result from a specific interaction between topoisomerase IV and SeqA. Besides the asynchrony and overinitiation of chromosomal replication, seqA mutants have an aberrant nucleoid structure, an increased frequency of abnormal segregation, and increased negative superhelicity of chromosomal and plasmid DNA (5Lu M. Campbell J.L. Boye E. Kleckner N. Cell. 1994; 77: 413-426Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar, 14Hiraga S. Ichinose C. Niki H. Yamazoe M. Mol.

These findings suggest that interaction with SeqA is required for proper functioning of topoisomerase IV in vivo. In addition, SeqA functions as a transcriptional regulator of the bacteriophage λpR promoter (17Slominska M. Wegrzyn A. Konopa G. Skarstad K. Wegrzyn G. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 40: 1371-1379Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The SeqA protein exists as a homotetramer of 21-kDa polypeptides (18Lee H. Kang S. Bae S.H. Choi B.S. Hwang D.S. J. Biol.

The N-terminal region of SeqA (SeqA-N; amino acid residues 1–50) is responsible for its tetrameric property and for aggregation of the protein (18Lee H. Kang S. Bae S.H. Choi B.S. Hwang D.S. J. Biol.

SeqA-C interacts via hydrogen bonds and van der Waals contacts with the major groove of DNA, with the hemi-methylated A-T base pair and also with the surrounding bases and DNA backbone. The NMR structure of hemi-methylated GATC revealed that it has an unusual backbone structure and a remarkably narrow major groove and suggested that this peculiar structural feature might contribute to recognition of hemi-methylated GATC sites by SeqA protein (23Bae S.H.

To form a stable SeqA-DNA complex in the presence of competitor DNA, one SeqA tetramer binds to each of two hemi-methylated GATC sequences (20Han J.S. Kang S. Lee H. Kim H.K. Hwang D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 34983-34989Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) that are up to 31 bases apart on the DNA (24Brendler T. Sawitzke J. Sergueev K. Austin S. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 6249-6258Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). The sequential binding of SeqA tetramers to hemi-methylated sites leads to the formation of higher order complexes (20Han J.S. Kang S. Lee H. Kim H.K. Hwang D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 34983-34989Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Further, the binding of SeqA proteins to at least six adjacent hemi-methylated sites induces the aggregation of free proteins onto the bound proteins, thus implying cooperative interaction between the SeqA proteins. Such aggregation may be responsible for the SeqA foci that have been visualized by immunofluorescence microscopy and by expression of a SeqA-green fluorescent protein (GFP) fusion protein (14Hiraga S. Ichinose C. Niki H. Yamazoe M. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 381-387Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar, 24Brendler T. Sawitzke J. Sergueev K. Austin S.

These foci appear to track the replication fork, and their number is proportional to growth rate (24Brendler T. Sawitzke J. Sergueev K. Austin S. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 6249-6258Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Here, we show that binding of SeqA to hemi-methylated DNA induces a conformational change of the DNA; the bound SeqA proteins interact cooperatively with each other, which increases their tendency to interact and aggregate.

Three hours after induction, the cells were harvested and resuspended in 25 mm HEPES (pH 7.8), 1 mm EDTA, and 1 mm dithiothreitol.

The top or bottom strand of synthetic hemi-methylated 75-mer DNAs was 32P end-labeled and incubated with SeqA for 15 min at 30 °C, followed by treatment with 200 μm 1,10-phenanthroline-copper and 5.8 mm 3-mercaptopropionic acid for 35 s at 30 °C. The cleavage reaction was stopped by adding 0.1 volume of 28 mm 2,9-dimethyl-1,10-phenanthroline. SeqA-bound DNA and free DNA were separated by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (5% w/v). Subsequent steps were performed as before (37Lee Y.S. Hwang D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 83-88Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Binding of SeqA Protein to Two Hemi-methylated GATC Sequences Induces DNA Bending—A SeqA protein as tetramer can bind to two hemi-methylated GATC sequences (20Han J.S. Kang S. Lee H. Kim H.K. Hwang D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 34983-34989Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) that are separated by up to 31 bp (24Brendler T. Sawitzke J. Sergueev K. Austin S. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 6249-6258Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). We examined the possibility that the DNA is bent as a result of this event. The DNA fragments used were identical in size but varied in the relative location of a pair of hemi-methylated sites (Fig. 1, A and B). The indicated spacing refers to the number of nucleotides between the N6-methyladenine nucleotides of the GATC sequences. A bend near the center of a DNA fragment maximally retards the electrophoretic mobility of a DNA-protein complex (30Zwieb C. Kim J. Adhya S. Genes Dev. 1989; 3: 606-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). With DNA in which the hemi-methylated sites were separated by 19 bp, so that they were on the same phase of DNA helix, SeqA binding produced a typical DNA-bending pattern. Although bending was not initially apparent with a 16- or 25-bp spacing, such that the two hemi-methylated sites were on opposite phases, a pattern of bent DNA did appear when electrophoresis was continued for longer periods (data not shown). These observations suggest that the extent of bending is dependent on the relative position of the two hemi-methylated sites on the DNA helix and is favored when the two hemi-methylated sites are on the same phase. We compared the affinity of SeqA for DNA containing different spacings between the two hemi-methylated GATC sequences (Fig 1, C and D). Its affinity for hemi-methylated DNA containing an 11-, 21-, or 31-bp spacing was higher than for a 16- and 26-bp spacing. The more efficient binding of SeqA to DNA with the two hemi-methylated sites on the same phase of the DNA helix is in agreement with a previous report (24Brendler T. Sawitzke J. Sergueev K. Austin S. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 6249-6258Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Therefore, the phase difference between the two hemi-methylated GATC sequences affects the affinity of SeqA for it as well as DNA bending. Interaction between Two SeqA Proteins Bound on Hemimethylated DNA—We analyzed the interaction between SeqA proteins bound to each of two hemi-methylated GATC sequences by employing DNA containing four hemi-methylated sites (Fig. 2). The spacing between the first and second and between the third and fourth sites was fixed, while the spacing between the second and third sites varied. The lengths of the DNAs were similar, with no more than 4 bp difference (Table I). SeqA formed fast and slow mobility complexes with all of these DNAs (Fig. 2, A and B). We showed previously that the fast and slow mobility complexes are formed by binding one and two molecules of SeqA, respectively, (20Han J.S. Kang S. Lee H. Kim H.K. Hwang D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 34983-34989Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The fast mobility complexes migrated similarly regardless of the spacing. The slow mobility complexes involving DNA with spacing of >30 bp also migrated at similar rates whereas the slow mobility complexes involving spacing of ≤30 bp migrated at different rates. If the bound SeqA proteins interacted, these complexes would each have a unique nucleoprotein structure, thereby migrating differently through the polyacrylamide gel. The absence of any difference in the migration of the slow mobility complexes formed with spacings of >30 bp suggests that the SeqA proteins bound to those DNAs did not interact. More slow mobility complexes were formed with DNA having a spacing of 19 or 27 bp than with DNA with a spacing of 32 bp (Fig. 2C), supporting the idea that SeqA binds cooperatively to DNA with a spacing of ≤30 bp. The altered migration and efficient formation of slow mobility complexes when the spacing between the two sites is ≤30 bp indicated that the SeqA proteins bound to each pair of hemi-methylated sites interact. Interactions between SeqA Proteins Stabilize the Unstable Binding of SeqA to a Hemi-methylated Site—The binding of a SeqA tetramer to a pair of hemi-methylated GATC sequences yielded a fast mobility complex when the DNA contained two sites, but not to any significant extent when it contained only one site (20Han J.S. Kang S. Lee H. Kim H.K. Hwang D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 34983-34989Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). We therefore compared the binding of SeqA to four synthetic oligonucleotides containing identical sequences but with one, two, three, or four N6-methyladenine residues within the GATC sequences on one strand (Fig. 3, A and B). Formation of fast mobility complexes increased with the number of hemi-methylated GATC sequences. Furthermore a new slow mobility complex that contained two SeqA proteins appeared with three hemi-methylated sites, and formation of this complex was enhanced with four hemi-methylated sites. Evidently the formation of a slow mobility complex by binding of SeqA to DNA containing three hemi-methylated sites is more favorable than formation of the fast mobility complex with DNA containing one hemi-methylated site, although these complexes result from the binding of one SeqA to one hemimethylated site. The greater efficiency with which the slow mobility complex is formed in the first case suggests that the SeqA tetramers bound to two hemi-methylated sites on the DNA facilitate or stabilize the binding of the additional SeqA to an unbound hemi-methylated site. To examine this cooperative binding, we varied the spacing between the second and third hemi-methylated site (Fig. 3C), and we changed the un-methylated GATC sequence at the fourth site to a GTTC sequence to prevent any possible contribution from it. Slow mobility complexes were formed with spacings of 12 and 19 bp, but not when the spacing was greater. This shows that the SeqA proteins bound to two hemi-methylated sites are able to facilitate the binding of an additional SeqA to the third hemi-methylated site but only when the third site was separated from the second by <32 bp. This conclusion is of course consistent with our finding that the cooperative interaction between two SeqA proteins bound to hemi-methylated DNA requires a spacing of ≤30 bp (Fig. 2). Interactions between SeqA Proteins Stabilize the Unfavorable Binding of Mutant SeqA Proteins to Hemi-methylated Sites— SeqA(E9K) protein, in which a Glu-9 is substituted for a Lys, is not able to form fast mobility complexes, only slow mobility complexes, with DNA containing four hemi-methylated sites (18Lee H. Kang S. Bae S.H. Choi B.S. Hwang D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 34600-34606Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The introduction of the additional change of Lys for Glu-5 abolished formation of the slow mobility complex (Fig. 4A). Because instability of SeqA(E5,9K) hampered its purification, a partially purified fraction obtained from a seqA-null mutant harboring a SeqA(E5,9K)-overproducing plasmid was used for binding assays. To compensate for any effect of contaminating proteins, the assays were controlled by addition of a partially purified fraction prepared from the seqA-null mutant-containing vector. Despite its inability to bind to hemi-methylated sites, SeqA(E5,9K) could convert the fast mobility complex formed by SeqA to a slow mobility complex (Fig. 4B), indicating that SeqA bound to hemi-methylated sites helps SeqA(E5,9K) bind to additional sites. To throw further light on the binding of SeqA(E5,9K) as a result of interaction with SeqA, we used SeqA(K66E/R70E), which forms complexes that migrate more rapidly, in place of SeqA. The substitutions of Lys-66 and Arg-70 with glutamates might increase the electronegativity of SeqA and lead to the faster migration of the SeqA(E5,9K)-DNA complexes (Fig. 4C, lanes 2 and 4; Ref. 20Han J.S. Kang S. Lee H. Kim H.K. Hwang D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 34983-34989Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Slow mobility complexes exhibiting an intermediate mobility were formed by the binding of one SeqA protein to a pair of hemi-methylated sites together with binding of one SeqA(K66E/R70E) protein to the other pair of hemimethylated sites (lane 3). Incubation of SeqA(E5,9K) together with SeqA(K66E/R70E) generated a slow mobility complex of the same intermediate mobility (lanes 5 and 6) as the complex formed by SeqA plus SeqA(K66E/R70E). The similarity of the OP-Cu(II) footprints of the slow mobility complexes formed by SeqA, SeqA(K66E/R70E), and the mixture of SeqA(K66E/R70E) and SeqA(E5,9K) indicated that SeqA(E5,9K) is bound to two hemi-methylated sites in the slow mobility complex (Fig. 4D). Thus, despite the inability of SeqA(E5,9K) to bind to hemi-methylated sites on its own, the fact that it is able to bind to hemi-methylated sites when present together with SeqA or SeqA(K66E/R70E) implies that the cooperative interaction of SeqA proteins on the hemi-methylated sites stabilizes binding that would otherwise not be possible. Stepwise Interaction of SeqA Proteins Bound to Hemi-methylated DNA Augments Their Ability to Interact—A SeqA molecule bound to two hemi-methylated sites is able to interact cooperatively with a molecule on another site separated from it by up to 30 bp (Figs. 2 and 3). We next examined the interaction of two SeqA proteins cooperatively bound on four hemi-methylated sites with an additional SeqA using DNAs containing six hemi-methylated sites in which the spacing between the second and third sites was varied, while the spacing between all the other sites was fixed (Fig. 5). As the amount of SeqA was increased, the binding of a SeqA to pairs of hemi-methylated sites was observed to result in the sequential formation of three discrete complexes (complex I, II, and III) (Fig. 5A). After these three complexes were formed, there appeared larger complexes in both the upper region of the gel (complex IV) and the well (complex V). The formation of the large complexes is in agreement with our previous finding that SeqA proteins bound to six or more adjacent hemi-methylated sites tend to form aggregates with the free proteins (20Han J.S. Kang S. Lee H. Kim H.K. Hwang D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 34983-34989Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The absence of both the discrete and the large complexes when the GATC sequences were fully methylated demonstrates that the formation of these complexes is dependent upon hemi-methylation. Quantification of the large complexes (complex V) (Fig. 5B) showed that for a spacing of up to 60 bp between the second and third sites, the yield of the large complex was constant; thereafter, increased spacing resulted in a reduction in the yield. We then changed one or two of the GATC sequences at the left end of the DNA that were separated by 60 bp to GTTC sequences (Fig. 5C). With six hemi-methylated sites, increasing amounts of SeqA generated complexes I, II, and III followed by the large complexes, as shown in Fig. 5A. The DNA with five hemi-methylated sites produced complexes similar to the above except for the inefficient formation of complex III. With only four hemi-methylated sites, only complexes I and II containing one and two SeqA proteins, respectively, were formed. In summary, a SeqA tetramer bound to two hemi-methylated sites interacts cooperatively with another SeqA bound at a distance of ≤30 bp (see Fig. 6). The cooperative interaction between these two SeqA proteins enhances their capacity for interaction, thereby favoring the formation of a larger complex involving another SeqA bound up to 200 bp from the leftmost binding site. Such interaction between three bound SeqA proteins triggers the further aggregation of free proteins with the bound proteins, generating large aggregates. The C-terminal region of SeqA (amino acid residues 71–181) contains a domain that binds to hemi-methylated GATC sequences while the N-terminal region (1–50) is responsible for tetramer formation (19Guarné A. Zhao Q. Ghirlando R. Yang W. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2002; 9: 839-843PubMed Google Scholar, 22Fujikawa N. Kurumizaka H. Nureki O. Tanaka Y. Yamazoe M. Hiraga S. Yokoyama S. Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: 82-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The two regions are connected by a flexible linker. Although SeqA is a homotetramer (18Lee H. Kang S. Bae S.H. Choi B.S.

Biol. 2002; 9: 839-843PubMed Google Scholar), chemical cross-linking and the footprinting pattern point to a basic dimeric configuration of the tetramer (35Brendler T. Austin S. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2304-2310Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 38Fossum S. Soreide S. Skarstad K. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 47: 619-632Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). We speculate that the SeqA tetramer has a Y shape (Fig. 6A). In this structure the N-terminal regions of the four subunits are apposed while the C-terminal regions connected to the N termini by the flexible linkers are partially split in two with two of the subunits closer than the other two. In the presence of competitor DNAs, binding of a SeqA protein to two hemi-methylated sites is required to form a stable SeqA-DNA complex (20Han J.S. Kang S. Lee H. Kim H.K. Hwang D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 34983-34989Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The two hemi-methylated sites can be separated by up to 31 bp and located on different phases of the helix (Fig. 1: 24). The flexible binding of SeqA could be achieved if one of the pairs of closely connected subunits recognizes one of the two hemi-methylated sites so that the other pair of subunits can bind to the other site, bends the DNA between the two hemi-methylated sites (Fig. 1) and so stabilizes the binding of the tetramer to the two hemi-methylated sites (Fig. 6A). A SeqA tetramer bound to two hemi-methylated sites can interact with further molecules. Cooperative interaction between the two SeqA proteins occurs when the pair of hemimethylated sites are located within ≤30 bp, otherwise they bind independently (Fig. 2). This cooperative binding is able to stabilize the binding of a wild-type to a single hemi-methylated site (Figs. 3 and 5B) or a mutant SeqA molecule to additional hemi-methylated sites (Fig. 4). Cooperativity was more obvious with DNA containing a larger number of hemi-methylated sites (Fig. 5). Thus two cooperatively SeqA proteins bound to four adjacent hemi-methylated sites could interact with a SeqA protein bound to two hemi-methylated sites 185-bp apart on the same DNA or stabilize the binding of another SeqA to a single hemi-methylated site 60-bp apart (Fig. 5). Interaction between the three SeqA proteins could then induce aggregation of free SeqA proteins onto them (Fig. 5 and Ref. 20Han J.S. Kang S. Lee H. Kim H.K. Hwang D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 34983-34989Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). We propose that stepwise interaction of the bound SeqA proteins at hemimethylated sites augments their capacity for interaction and aggregation; consequently, as the number of interacting SeqA protein increases, this facilitates recruitment of SeqA that is free or bound distally at hemi-methylated sites, thus expanding the complex. This stepwise interaction followed by aggregation may be the driving force for the formation of the SeqA foci that appear to track replication forks in vivo (14Hiraga S. Ichinose C. Niki H.

https://openalex.org/W2061652016,"Bacterial intein-like (BIL) domains are newly identified homologs of intein protein-splicing domains. The two known types of BIL domains together with inteins and hedgehog (Hog) auto-processing domains form the Hog/intein (HINT) superfamily. BIL domains are distinct from inteins and Hogs in sequence, phylogenetic distribution, and host protein type, but little is known about their biochemical activity. Here we experimentally study the auto-processing activity of four BIL domains. An A-type BIL domain from Clostridium thermocellum showed both protein-splicing and auto-cleavage activities. The splicing is notable, because this domain has a native Ala C′-flanking residue rather than a nucleophilic residue, which is absolutely necessary for intein protein splicing. B-type BIL domains from Rhodobacter sphaeroides and Rhodobacter capsulatus cleaved their N′ or C′ ends. We propose an alternative protein-splicing mechanism for the A-type BIL domains. After an initial N-S acyl shift, creating a thioester bond at the N′ end of the domain, the C′ end of the domain is cleaved by Asn cyclization. The resulting amino end of the C′-flank attacks the thioester bond next at the N′ end of the domain. This aminolysis step splices the two flanks of the domain. The B-type BIL domain cleavage activity is explained in the context of the canonical intein protein-splicing mechanism. Our results suggest that the different HINT domains have related biochemical activities of proteolytic cleavages, ligation and splicing. Yet the predominant reactions diverged in each HINT type according to their specific biological roles. We suggest that the BIL domain cleavage and splicing reactions are mechanisms for post-translationally generating protein variability, particularly in extracellular bacterial proteins.

Belenkiy O. Dassa B. Shainskaya A. Pietrokovski S. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 47: 61-73Google Scholar). The two known types of BIL domains together with inteins and hedgehog-like (Hog) auto-processing domains form the HINT (Hog/Intein) domain superfamily (2Paulus H. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 447-496Google Scholar). Inteins and Hogs have related auto-catalytic protein-processing activities. Hog domains rearrange their N′-peptide bond into a thioester bond. This thioester is cleaved by a nucleophilic attack of a cholesterol molecule bound by a downstream domain (3Porter J.A. Ekker S.C. Park W.J. von Kessler D.P. Young K.E. Chen C.H. Ma Y. Woods A.S. Cotter R.J. Koonin E.V. Beachy P.A. Cell. 1996; 86: 21-34Google Scholar, 4Perler F.B. Cell. 1998; 92: 1-4Google Scholar). A similar nucleophilic attack occurs during the protein splicing of inteins out of their protein hosts. The rearranged ester/thioester bond at the intein N′ end is attacked by the nucleophilic side chain of the intein C′-flanking residue followed by additional splicing reactions (5Xu M.Q. Comb D.G. Paulus H. Noren C.J. Shao Y. Perler F.B. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5517-5522Google Scholar). Intein protein splicing thus depends on an invariable Cys, Ser, or Thr nucleophilic C′-flanking residue (+1) for the trans-esterification and acyl rearrangement steps (2Paulus H. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 447-496Google Scholar, 6Perler F. Noren C. Wang J. Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. 2000; 39: 450-466Google Scholar).BIL domains are distinct from inteins and Hogs in sequence, phylogenetic distribution, and host protein type (1Amitai G. Belenkiy O. Dassa B. Shainskaya A. Pietrokovski S. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 47: 61-73Google Scholar). Each of the two BIL types has characteristic and unique sequence features that cluster them separately from other HINT types. Although inteins are integrated in highly conserved sites of essential proteins and Hogs are present in hedgehog and related nematode proteins, BIL domains are integrated in variable regions of non-conserved diverse bacterial proteins, some of which have extracellular motifs. This leads to the hypothesis that BIL domains may have biological roles different from those of other HINT domains (1Amitai G. Belenkiy O. Dassa B. Shainskaya A. Pietrokovski S. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 47: 61-73Google Scholar). Yet little is known regarding the biochemical activity of each BIL type.We previously described (1Amitai G. Belenkiy O. Dassa B. Shainskaya A. Pietrokovski S. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 47: 61-73Google Scholar) the catalytic activity of an A-type and a B-type BIL domain. The A-type BIL domain was shown to have protein-splicing and C′-cleavage activities. However, this domain was naturally flanked by a Thr +1 residue, which is typical of inteins but not of A-type BIL domains. Only 15% of known A-type BIL domains is followed by Ser or Thr, and none is followed by Cys residues. An A-type BIL domain with +1 Tyr residue was shown recently by Southworth et al. (7Southworth M.W. Yin J. Perler F.B. Biochem. Soc Trans. 2004; 32: 250-254Google Scholar) to have N′-terminal cleavage but no protein-splicing activity. The B-type BIL domain was examined previously by us only in a cell-free system. It was shown to be active with preliminary evidence for cleavage and protein splicing. Peptide splicing outside the context of intein-like domains also was shown recently to occur in the proteasome, generating variant peptides to be displayed on major histocompatibility complex class I proteins (8Vigneron N. Stroobant V. Chapiro J. Ooms A. Degiovanni G. Morel S. Van Der Bruggen P. Boon T. Van Den Eynde B.J. Science. 2004; 304: 587-590Google Scholar).Here we examine in detail the auto-cleavage and splicing activity of four BIL domains: one A-type BIL domain with a native non-nucleophilic C′-flanking residue (Ala +1) and three different B-type BIL domains. We also show that BIL domains are present in more major groups of bacteria and in proteins likely to be secreted. The probable functions and chemical reaction mechanisms of BIL domains and their relation to inteins are discussed.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESBacterial Strains and DNA Primers—Rhodobacter sphaeroides 2.4.1 (Rsp) genome was a kind gift from Dr. Steven L. Porter (University of Oxford). Rhodobacter capsulatus (Rca) MD1 genome was a kind gift from Dr. Fevzi Daldal (University of Pennsylvania), and Clostridium thermocellum (Cth) genome was a kind gift from Dr. Ying Tsai (University of Rochester).

The chimeric protein, M-B-C, was overexpressed and extracted in E. coli bacteria as described previously (1Amitai G. Belenkiy O. Dassa B. Shainskaya A. Pietrokovski S. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 47: 61-73Google Scholar). Protein extraction buffer contained 20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 200 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 1 mm sodium azide.Purification of Tagged Protein Products—Soluble protein products containing eitheraCoraMtag were purified on affinity columns using chitin (New England Biolabs) or amylose (New England Biolabs) beads, respectively. Lysed cell supernatant in extraction buffer was applied to beads for 1 h at 4 °C with shaking. Elution of proteins from chitin beads was done by mixing the beads with SDS-PAGE sample loading buffer and boiling for 2–3 min. Extraction buffer with 10 mm maltose was used to elute proteins from amylose beads.Heat Purification of BIL4-Cth Domain—The supernatant of E. coli cell lysate overexpressing the BIL4-Cth construct was heated in extraction buffer to 37–80 °C for 20 min. Soluble proteins were separated from the denatured ones by centrifugation at 13,000 rpm for 3 min and applied on an SDS gel.In Vitro Protein Transcription/Translation—In vitro transcription/translation was carried out using E. coli S30 extract for circular DNA system (Promega, Madison WI) as described by Amitai et al. (1Amitai G. Belenkiy O. Dassa B. Shainskaya A. Pietrokovski S. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 47: 61-73Google Scholar).Western Blot Analysis—Western blot analysis was used to identify protein products containing either the M or C tag and to identify the GroEL and DnaK protein chaperones. To identify the M tag, monoclonal mouse antibodies directed at maltose-binding protein (Novus Biologicals, Littleton, CO) were used in a 1:800 ratio. To identify the C tag, polyclonal rabbit antibodies directed at CBD (New England Biolabs) were used in a ratio of 1:5000. Antibodies for GroEL were a kind gift from Prof. Amnon Horovitz (rabbit antibodies, used in a ratio of 1:1000), and DnaK mouse antibodies (Stressgen) were used in a ratio of 1:1000.

Chemiluminescence detection was held using SuperSignal (Pierce) according to the manufacturer's protocol.Mass Spectrometry (MS) Methods—Intact molecular weight measurements and peptide mass mapping by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI) MS were performed at the Weizmann Institute Biological Mass Spectrometry unit and at the Smolar Center for proteins (Technion, Israel). Electroelution from gel followed by in-gel digestion with trypsin, chymotrypsin, or V8 proteases was performed and analyzed as described previously (37, Mehlman, T., Benjamin, M., Merhav, D., Osman, F., Ben-Asouli, Y., Goldshleger, R., Karlish, S., and Shainskaya, A. (2002) Proceedings of the 50th Conference of American Society for Mass Spectrometry, Orlando, June 2–6, 2002, American Society for Mass Spectrometry, Santa Fe, NMGoogle Scholar).N-terminal Amino Acid Sequencing—Proteins were electrophoresed by SDS-PAGE, and selected bands were prepared as described by Amitai et al. (9Amitai G. Dassa B. Pietrokovski S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 3121-3131Google Scholar) and subjected to Edman degradation at the Weizmann Institute Biological Mass Spectrometry Unit.Computational Sequence Analysis—Sequence searches used the BLAST programs (10Altschul S.F. Madden T.L. Schaffer A.A. Zhang J. Zhang Z. Miller W. Lipman D.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3389-3402Google Scholar) and the BLIMPS program for block-to-sequence searches (11Henikoff S. Henikoff J.G. Alford W.J. Pietrokovski S. Gene (Amst.). 1995; 163: 17-26Google Scholar). Block multiple sequence alignments and phylogenetic analysis were conducted as described by Amitai et al. (1Amitai G. Belenkiy O. Dassa B. Shainskaya A. Pietrokovski S. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 47: 61-73Google Scholar). Protein motifs were detected using the InterProScan tool (www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/scan.html).RESULTSTo characterize the proteolytic activity of new A- and B-type BIL domains, each BIL domain (B) was cloned in-frame between two protein tags, maltose-binding protein (M) upstream and chitin-binding domain (C) downstream. Protein products of each chimeric gene (M-B-C) were examined in vivo and in vitro by various methods. To characterize the BIL domain activity in its native protein context, some of the domains were cloned with their full or partial native flanks, whereas others were cloned only with single residue flanks.Protein Splicing and Cleavage of an A-type BIL Domain with Ala +1 Residue—BIL4-Cth is one of the 23 A-type BIL domains we identified in the thermophilic bacterium Cth (1Amitai G. Belenkiy O. Dassa B. Shainskaya A. Pietrokovski S. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 47: 61-73Google Scholar). It is typical of most A-type BIL domains to have all of the intein protein-splicing active site residues with the exception of the C′-flanking nucleophile (supplemental Fig. S3). Instead of Cys, Ser, or Thr invariably present in inteins, BIL4-Cth is followed by an Ala +1 residue. This is the residue present in 18% A-type BIL domains (fraction calculated as weighted average of putative active domains).The BIL4-Cth M-B-C precursor was overexpressed in vivo as a double-tagged protein, and its products were detected and analyzed. Putative protein-splicing products, the excised BIL domain and the ligated M-C flanks, and the M-B- and M-cleavage products were detected. These products were identified by Western blotting of total cell lysates and affinity-purified proteins separated on SDS-PAGE (Fig. 1A). Relative quantities of products were calculated according to measurements taken from Coomassie Blue-stained SDS gels of amylose-purified proteins and total lysates (supplemental Fig. S1). Only trace amounts of the M-B-C precursor were detected under all of the separation procedures, indicating an efficient processing. Spliced product M-C comprised 20–25% of the final products, whereas C′-cleavage product M-B comprised ∼5% of the final products. M and B proteins comprised most of the final products, indicating that they were generated by a combination of N′- and C′-cleavages. The final amount of B protein was much larger than the amount of the M-C-splicing product. This finding implies that both protein splicing and cleavage at its N′ and C′ ends released the B protein. The C product was not identified in the gels, perhaps because of cellular degradation.To characterize the putative splicing product using MALDI MS, the M-C band was extracted from the gel and digested with proteolytic enzymes. The presence of the M and C domains was verified using MS/MS analyses. Furthermore, two peptide masses corresponding to splicing-junction peptides were detected from the chymotrypsin digestion of the M-C band. One mass corresponded to a fully cleaved (N′-GSASRVDCGGLTGL-C′) peptide, and another mass corresponded to its miscleaved form (N′-GSASRVDCGGLTGLNSGLTTNPGVSAWC′) with high mass accuracies (Table II). The ligated splicing junction is between the second and third residues (Ser-Ala) with the Ser being coded by a linker joining the M tag to the BIL domain and the Ala being the native residue downstream of the BIL domain (Ala +1).Table IIMALDI-TOF results of BIL4-Cth splicing junction chymotryptic peptidesSequence position[M+H]+ calculated massaMass calculated with carboxyamidomethyl cysteine modification.[M + H]+ observed massMass accuracySequenceDappm392-4051349.651349.7144.45GSASRVDCGGLTGL392-4182634.262634.80205GSASRVDCGGLTGLNSGLTTNPGVSAWa Mass calculated with carboxyamidomethyl cysteine modification. Open table in a new tab Spliced BIL domain was purified, and its identity was verified by MS. We were able to purify the BIL domain by heat treatment, probably because it originated from a thermophilic bacterium. Incubation of total cell lysate at 80 °C left only the putative BIL domain in the soluble fraction (Fig. 1B). Intact mass MS analysis of this 15-kDa band identified the expected mass of the BIL domain, and its sequence was verified by MS/MS analysis (see Table IV and data not shown). The exact C′ end of the BIL domain was identified by MS analysis as Asn as expected (Table III).Table IVMALDI-TOF results of BIL domains splicing and cleavage products intact massCloneProbable product[M+H]+ calculated mass[M+H]+ observed massMass accuracykDa%BIL4-CthM-B58.03858.5520.89M43.09243.9832.06B14.96315.0500.58BIL2-RSP-onlyM-B56.78256.0711.25DnaK69.11869.2550.19M-B-C64.14165.4302.00BIL1-RSPGroEL/MC57.332/57.35558.3171.72RCA-1522GroEL57.33257.8100.83 Open table in a new tab Table IIIElectrospray Ionization TOF results of BIL4-Cth C-terminal tryptic peptidesSequence positionCalculated massObserved massaObserved masses are an average of [M+2H]2+, [M+3H]3+, and [M+4H]4+ masses for the first peptide and of [M+3H]3+ and [M+4H]4+ masses for the second peptide.Mass accuracySequenceDappm118-1352108.95452109.053346.8VDDFHTYHVGDNEVLVHN113-1352760.29272760.326112.1VYNFKVDDFHTYHVGDNEVLVHNa Observed masses are an average of [M+2H]2+, [M+3H]3+, and [M+4H]4+ masses for the first peptide and of [M+3H]3+ and [M+4H]4+ masses for the second peptide. Open table in a new tab A putative C′-cleavage product, M-B, was affinity-purified and identified by anti-M antibodies (Fig. 1A). Its intact mass analysis corresponded to the expected mass of a C′-cleavage product (Table IV). Other masses obtained from this sample corresponded to the M tag and to other smaller masses that could result from a cross-contamination of the M-B band by traces of smaller proteins on the gel.A protein band corresponding to the M tag was identified by Coomassie Blue staining and by Western blotting using anti-M antibodies (Fig. 1A and supplemental Fig. S1). This putative N′-cleavage product was observed in total lysates and in elutions of both chitin and amylose affinity columns.To examine whether the Tris cell extraction and protein purification buffer promoted cleavage and splicing of the M-B-C precursor, the extraction and purification procedures were repeated using different buffers (Bis-Tris propane, HEPES, sodium phosphate, and borate). Same products and relative amounts were observed with all of these control buffers (data not shown).In Vivo and in Vitro Cleavage Activities of B-type BIL Domains—B-type BIL domains are more heterogeneous in sequence than A-type domains (1Amitai G. Belenkiy O. Dassa B. Shainskaya A. Pietrokovski S. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 47: 61-73Google Scholar). To characterize their activity, we cloned three different B-type BIL domains into the double-tagged system (described above): the two BIL domains present in R. sphaeroides termed BIL1-Rsp and BIL2-Rsp and one of the 14 BIL domains present in R. capsulatus termed 1522-Rca. The conserved C′ sequence motif of B-type BIL domains is distinct from those motifs in other known HINT domains (1Amitai G. Belenkiy O. Dassa B. Shainskaya A. Pietrokovski S. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 47: 61-73Google Scholar). The C′ end of the cloned BIL1-Rsp and 1522-Rca is typical of B-type BIL domains, whereas BIL2-Rsp has an atypical C′ end (supplemental Fig. S3).N′-cleavage of B-type BIL1-Rsp—BIL1-Rsp, a B-type BIL domain from R. sphaeroides, was cloned between M and C tags with its native N′-14 residue and C′-51 residue flanks and overexpressed in E. coli cells. M-B-C precursor M and B-C N′-cleavage products were identified by Coomassie Blue staining and Western blotting of total lysate and affinity-purified protein samples (Fig. 2). To verify the nature of the N′-cleavage product, B-C, the band was micro-sequenced. The resulting sequence (XFTPGT) corresponded to the predicted N′ end of the BIL domain, which also includes Cys-1, which usually cannot be detected by this method (supplemental Table S-I).Fig. 2N′-cleavage activity of BIL1-Rsp. Protein products from E. coli overexpression of M-B-C construct with B-type BIL1-Rsp were eluted from amylose (A), chitin (C), or both (A+C) affinity columns or analyzed in total cell lysate (T). Proteins were separated on SDS-PAGE and either stained with Coomassie Blue or detected by anti-M, anti-C, or anti-GroEL (Anti-G) antibodies. See “Results” for discussion of GroEL cross-detection by anti-C antibodies.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)An additional 58-kDa band was co-purified with the M-B-C precursor. Its analysis suggests that the band might include more than a single protein species. Both anti-M and anti-C antibodies reacted with this band. However, the peptide mapping of the band identified peptides from both the M tag and the E. coli GroEL chaperone protein. Additionally, no peptides from the B and C domains were identified (data not shown). Intact mass of the band identified a mass of 58.317 kDa corresponding to GroEL and an additional unidentified protein mass of 65.175 kDa (Table IV). As a control, we checked a cross-reaction of anti-C antibodies with purified GroEL protein (supplemental Fig. S2B). Anti-C antibodies showed reactivity toward GroEL, probably because of their polyclonal nature.GroEL chaperone was detected in protein samples purified the following affinity columns: on amylose; chitin; and amylose followed by chitin. This indicates a tight and specific binding of GroEL with the precursor and/or protein products. The association of GroEL with unfolded proteins is reversible to some extent upon incubation with ATP-Mg-K (12Bukau B. Horwich A. Cell. 1998; 92: 351-366Google Scholar). Such incubation of washed protein samples bound on chitin reduced but did not eliminate the amount of GroEL eluted from chitin (supplemental Fig. S2B).C′-cleavage of B-type BIL2-Rsp in Vivo, in Vitro, and in Cell-free Systems—BIL2-Rsp was cloned between M and C tags with one native flanking residue at either end (N′-Leu and C′-Pro) and overexpressed in E. coli and in a cell-free system. In both systems, the main product was the M-B-C precursor with small amounts of M-B- and M-cleavage products (Fig. 3A). An additional band of ∼70 kDa appeared above the precursor band when expressed in vivo. This band was identified as the E. coli DnaK chaperone protein. It was not detected in the overexpressed control protein, M-C. Identity of the above products was verified by Western blotting, N-terminal sequencing of the M-B-C band, MALDI-MS peptide mapping of the M-B and DnaK bands, and MALDI MS intact mass analysis of the M-B band (Fig. 3A, Table IV, and data not shown). This last analysis gave a measured mass of 56.071 kDa, slightly smaller than the expected mass of the putative M-B product.Fig. 3C′-cleavage activity of BIL2-Rsp.A, left, protein products from E. coli overexpression of M-B-C construct with B-type BIL2-Rsp were eluted from either amylose (A) or chitin (C) affinity columns or analyzed in total cell lysate (T). Proteins were separated on SDS-PAGE and either stained with Coomassie Blue or detected by anti-M, anti-C, or anti DnaK antibodies. A, right, proteins translated in vitro in a cell-free system were labeled with [35S]Met. B, in vitro incubation of a purified precursor at 4 °C.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)To examine the in vitro activity of BIL2-Rsp, the overexpressed M-B-C precursor was isolated by sequential affinity columns (amylose followed by chitin) and was incubated in the extraction buffer in different temperatures for different time periods. Increasing amounts of the M-B product were clearly detected within 1 day at 4 °C (Fig. 3B). The presence of the M band may be attributed to the N′-cleavage of the BIL domain; however, the complementary B-C band was not detected. Alternatively, this could have resulted from protein degradation.Similar results were observed when BIL2-Rsp domain was cloned with its full native flanks (data not shown). However, this clone also underwent cleavage in an Arg-Arg dipeptide present in the N′-flank of the BIL domain as verified by N-terminal sequencing. This cleavage was also observed when the flanks were cloned without the BIL domain (data not shown). Thus, we suggest that this activity is unrelated to the BIL domain and is probably due to an E. coli protease (perhaps OmpT) that can cleave the BIL domain flank.No Activity of B-type Rca-1522 BIL—1522-Rca B-type BIL domain is natively present in a very large R. capsulatus protein. The domain is preceded by 1821 residues and is followed by 52 residues. The upstream flank of this BIL domain includes RTX (repeats-in toxin) calcium-binding repeat motifs, characteristic of secreted proteins (13Coote J. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 1992; 8: 137-161Google Scholar). The BIL domain was cloned with 36 N′-flanking residues and 35 C′-flanking residues in the double tag expression vector. Overexpression of the vector yielded only the M-B-C precursor and E. coli GroEL protein as verified by Coomassie Blue staining, Western blotting, N-terminal sequencing, and MS analysis (Table IV and supplemental Fig. S2A).Isolated M-B-C precursor was incubated in vitro at 4 or 37 °C in two different environments of pH 7.4 and 8.5. No products of the precursor were detected under any of these conditions.Species and Protein Host Distribution of BIL Domains—BIL domains were identified originally in species from Gram-negative α, β, and γ Proteobacteria and from Gram-positive Actinobacteria and the Bacillus/Clostridium group (1Amitai G. Belenkiy O. Dassa B. Shainskaya A. Pietrokovski S. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 47: 61-73Google Scholar). Further data base searches now broaden the taxonomic range of BIL domains to major bacterial divisions and lineages (supplemental Table S-II). A-type BIL domains were found in δ Proteobacteria, Cyanobacteria, Spirochaetes, Planctomycetes, and Verrucomicrobia. B-type BIL domains were found in α Proteobacteria, Rhizobium, and Silicibacter species.Sequence analyses of over a hundred identified BIL flanks reconfirmed our previous observation of the nature of the BIL domain hosts. BIL domains are present in homologs of known and predicted secreted proteins. This is exemplified by Streptomyces avermitilis, Verrucomicrobium, and Gloeobacter A-type BIL domains that are found downstream of long (400–5400 residues) Rhs core elements. Rhs elements are composite genetic elements, and their cores are believed to be cell-surface ligand-binding proteins (14Yong Dong W. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 4102-4110Google Scholar). The BIL domains are present in the hypervariable core extension region that can be shuffled between the core and downstream open-reading frame regions.DISCUSSIONIn this study, we show that a typical A-type BIL domain is capable of protein splicing without a C′-nucleophilic +1 residue and that B-type BIL domains can cleave their N′ or C′ ends. Both types of domains are not uncommon, appearing in diverse bacterial divisions. These findings reflect the auto-processing nature of intein-like domains.

Despite numerous efforts aimed at localizing the IDR and identifying aAb-interacting residues on TPO, only two critical amino acids, Lys713 and Tyr772, have been characterized. Precise and complete delineation of the other residues involved in the IDR remains to be defined. By using a recombinant anti-TPO aAb T13, we demonstrated that four regions on TPO are part of the IDR/B; one of them, located between amino acids 713 and 720, is particularly important for the binding of sera from patients suffering from AITD. To precisely define critical residues implicated in the binding of aAb to human TPO, we used directed mutagenesis and expressed the mutants in stably transfected CHO cells. Then we assessed the kinetic parameters involved in the interactions between anti-TPO aAbs and mutants by real-time analysis. We identified (i) the minimal epitope 713-717 recognized by mAb 47 (a reference antibody) and (ii) the amino acids used as contact points for two IDR-specific human monoclonal aAbs TR1.9 (Pro715 and Asp717) and T13 (Lys713, Phe714, Pro715, and Glu716). Using a rational strategy to identify complex epitopes on proteins showing a highly convoluted architecture, this study definitively identifies the amino acids Lys713-Asp717 as being the key residues recognized by IDR/B-specific anti-TPO aAbs in AITD.

As well as thyroglobulin and the thyrotropin receptor, TPO is a major thyroid autoantigen (aAg) targeted by the immune system during autoimmune thyroid diseases (AITD). Human TPO (hTPO) is a 933 amino acid molecule and possesses a highly convoluted three-dimensional structure formed by three distinct modules, respectively, homologous with the myeloperoxidase (MPO), the complement control protein (CCP), and the epidermal growth factor (EGF) (1Hobby P. Gardas A. Radomski R. McGregor A.M. Banga J.P. Sutton B.J. Endocrinology. 2000; 141: 2018-2026Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). This architectural complexity is a strong obstacle for producing high resolution crystals (2Hendry E. Taylor G. Ziemnicka K. Grennan Jones F. Furmaniak J. Rees Smith B. J.

Radomski R. McGregor A.M. Banga J.P. Sutton B.J. Endocrinology. 2000; 141: 2018-2026Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Autoantibodies (aAbs) against hTPO, strongly expressed in patients' sera, are sensitive and specific diagnostic markers for AITD and may play a role in the process leading to thyroid cellular dysfunction and destruction (4Chiovato L.

Rapoport B. McLachlan S.M. Clin. Exp. Immunol. 2000; 119: 38-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) and may consequently enhance AITD as previously shown for anti-thyroglobulin aAbs (10Dai Y. Carayanniotis K.A. Eliades P. Lymberi P. Shepherd P. Kong Y. Carayanniotis G. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 6987-6992PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, a precise delineation of the amino acids constituting the epitopes recognized by human aAbs on TPO would be very helpful for understanding how this aAg is recognized during the onset of AITD, as well as for developing specific immune interventions to prevent or block such pathologies. A high proportion of anti-TPO aAbs from patients' sera recognizes conformational and discontinuous epitopes, restricted to an immunodominant region (IDR) composed of two overlapping domains called A and B (11Chazenbalk G.D. Costante G. Portolano S. McLachlan S.M. Rapoport B. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1993; 77: 1715-1718PubMed Google Scholar-13Guo J. Mcintosh R.S. Czarnocka B. Weetman A.P. Rapoport B. McLachlan S.M. Clin. Exp. Immunol. 1998; 111: 408-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Several strategies have been used to localize these domains and, in particular, the critical amino acids involved in aAb interactions: (i) competition for TPO binding between mouse monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) or rabbit polyclonal antisera and human anti-TPO aAb (1Hobby P.

Interestingly, different studies have pointed out the relationship between region 710 and 722 of hTPO and the B domain of the IDR, as defined with four recombinant human Fab molecules from McLachlan and Rapoport's group (nomenclature used in this article). Chronologically, in 1991, Libert et al. (27Libert F. Ludgate M. Dinsart C. Vassart G. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1991; 73: 857-1860Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) described a linear epitope, called C21, located between amino acid residues 710 and 722, that is able to interact with anti-TPO aAbs in the sera from patients suffering from AITD. During the same year, Finke et al. (28Finke R. Seto P. Rapoport B. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1990; 71: 53-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) characterized the mouse mAb 47 produced by Ruf et al. (12Ruf J. Toubert M.E. Czarnocka B. Durand-Gorde J.M. Ferrand M. Carayon P. Endocrinology. 1989; 125: 1211-1218Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar), as recognizing a linear determinant in the region 713-721. Further studies, performed by different groups, showed that mAb 47/C21 epitope (i) characterizes in part the B domain of the IDR (12Ruf J. Toubert M.E. Czarnocka B. Durand-Gorde J.M. Ferrand M.

These competitions have been explained, firstly, by the fact that Lys713, comprising part of the mAb 47 epitope, was shown to be a contact point for Fab TR1.9 on TPO (26Guo J. Yan X.M. McLachlan S.M. Rapoport B. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 1327-1333Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Secondly, by using the combination of phage-displayed peptide technology followed by sequence alignment between mimotopes and primary sequence of hTPO, we recently localized the discontinuous immunodominant epitope of aAb T13 and found that it is partially composed of region 713-720 of hTPO (29Bresson D.

Importantly, in the same study, we revealed by directed mutagenesis that this region is one major component of the epitopes recognized by human anti-TPO aAbs from patients' sera. Despite the fact that all these data argue in favor of a critical role of region 713-720 inside the IDR, only one of the residues, Lys713, has been described as being a part of the IDR/B; thus, precise delineation of the critical residues from region 713-720 involved in IDR remains to be elucidated. By a guided mutagenesis study of this region followed by eukaryotic cell expression of each mutant, we identified: (i) the minimal epitope recognized by mAb 47 (amino acids 713-717) and (ii) the amino acids used as contact points for human aAbs TR1.9 (Pro715 and Asp717) and T13 (Lys713, Phe714, Pro715, and Glu716). By using a rational strategy to identify complex epitopes on proteins showing a highly convoluted architecture, the present study definitively assigns the amino acids from TPO region 713-717 as being the key residues recognized by IDR/B-specific anti-TPO aAbs in AITD. These data should be of great importance to rationally design therapeutic peptides able to block undesired autoimmune responses.

Chardes T. Peraldi-Roux S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 9560-9569Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) were previously described. Anti-TPO mAb 6H7 was purchased from Abcys S.A. (Paris, France). Rabbit polyclonal anti-TPO was prepared in the laboratory by injection of purified hTPO (HyTest Ltd.) in a New Zealand white rabbit, followed by two boosts. Each injection contained ∼600 μg of antigen in 1 ml of saline solution and 1 ml of Freund's incomplete adjuvant. The human recombinant aAb T13 was expressed as IgG1 or Fab by using the baculovirus/insect cell system as described (30Bresson D. Chardes T. Chapal N. Bes C. Cerutti M. Devauchelle G. Bouanani M. Mani J.C. Peraldi-Roux S. Hum. Antibodies. 2001; 10: 109-118Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Human Fab T13 was purified on a protein G affinity column and the concentration determined by measuring the absorbance at 280 nm, E0.1% of 1.56. Human aAb T13 (0.5 μg), expressed as Fab or full IgG1, was electrophoresed under non-reducing conditions on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and then transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane (Amersham Biosciences). The Fab T13 expression was checked by Western blotting, using a peroxidase-conjugated anti-human Fab- or Fc-specific Ab (Sigma, dilution 1:1,000) and the ECL detection system (Amersham Biosciences). The Fab T13 specificity was determined by ELISA. Wells were coated with 1 μg/ml of TPO in 100 mm NaHCO3, pH 9, overnight at 4 °C. Plates were washed with 0.05% Tween 20 in PBS (PBS-T), pH 7.3, and blocked with 2% nonfat dry milk in PBS-T (saturation buffer) for 1 h at 37 °C. After washing, aAb T13, expressed as Fab or the full IgG1 molecule, was incubated with 1% nonfat dry milk in PBS-T (incubation buffer) for 1 h 30 min at 37 °C. After washing, a peroxidase-conjugated anti-human Fab Ab (Sigma, diluted 1:1,000 in the incubation buffer) was added, and the plates were incubated for 1 h at 37 °C. After washing three times, the enzyme activity was detected with a 4 mg/ml 2-phenylenediamine solution containing 0.03% (v/v) hydrogen peroxide in 0.1 m citrate buffer, pH 5.0. After 20 min, the reaction was stopped by adding 50 μl of 2 m H2SO4 to each well, and the resulting absorbance was measured at 490 nm (A490). Kinetic Parameters of anti-TPO Autoantibody Binding Assessed by BIACORE Analysis—Surface plasmon resonance (SPR) analysis was performed at 25 °C with a 30 μl/min flow rate in HBS-EP (10 mm HEPES buffer, pH 7.4, 3 mm EDTA, 0.005% Biacore surfactant P20, 150 mm NaCl), using a BIACORE 3000 instrument (Biacore AB, Uppsala, Sweden). To measure the association and dissociation rate constants (ka and kd, respectively), and the dissociation equilibrium constant (KD = kd/ka) for the binding of mAb 47, IgG1 or Fab T13, and Fab TR1.9, human TPO was covalently immobilized at 1500 RU on the flow cell of a CM5 sensorchip by the amine coupling kit provided by the manufacturer. A second flow cell was subjected to the same chemical treatment without the protein and used as reference. Five concentrations of anti-TPO Ab were injected during 180 s over the two flow cells, followed by a dissociation step of 400 s and a regeneration step (10 μl of 40 mm HCl) between each concentration analysis. All the sensorgrams were corrected by subtracting the signal from the reference flow cell and were globally fitted to a 1:1 Langmuir binding isotherm using BIAevaluation version 3.2 software. Irrelevant mAb and Fab were used as analyte without giving any binding signal. Experiments at different flow rates showed an absence of mass transport and rebinding effects. Peptide Synthesis and Immunoassay on Cellulose Membrane-bound Peptides—The general protocol for Spot parallel peptide synthesis was described previously (31Laune D. Molina F. Ferrieres G. Mani J.C. Cohen P. Simon D. Bernardi T. Piechaczyk M. Pau B. Granier C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30937-30944Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). A set of 14-mer synthetic peptides corresponding to the region 709-722 of hTPO and its fourteen alanine analogs were synthesized by the Spot method. The membrane-bound peptides were probed by incubation of 2 μg/ml of mAb 47, Fabs T13, or TR1.9. Antibody binding was detected by using an alkaline phosphatase-conjugated anti-mouse Ig (Sigma, diluted 1:1,000), followed by addition of the phosphatase substrate 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indoyl phosphate and thiazolyl blue tetrazolium (Sigma), which gives a blue precipitate on peptides having bound the antibody. The membrane was re-used after a regeneration cycle. The intensity of the spots was evaluated with the ScionImage software. Blocking ELISA Experiments—The wells were coated with 1 μg/ml TPO in 100 mm NaHCO3, pH 9.6, overnight at 4 °C. Plates were washed and blocked with saturation buffer for 1 h at 37 °C. After washing three times, mouse mAb 47 or 6H7 was incubated at two concentrations (50 and 5 μg/ml) in incubation buffer for 2 h at 37 °C. Washing was performed and then human Fab T13 or TR1.9 was incubated at a concentration giving an A490 of 1.5. After 1 h at 37 °C and washing, a horse-radish peroxidase-conjugated anti-human (Fab′)2, diluted 1:8,000 (Sigma), was used to detect the binding of human Fab on TPO by incubation 1 h at 37 °C. Washing (3×) was performed, and then the reactivity was revealed as described above. The percent inhibition was calculated by comparing the binding of human Fab with or without inhibitor. Guided Mutagenesis and Stable Expression of Wild-type and Mutated TPO Complementary DNA—The full-length wild type (wt) and mutated TPO in the region 713-720 (fully mutated TPO713-720) were previously cloned in the pcDNA5/FRT expression vector from the Flp-In™ system (29Bresson D. Cerutti M. Devauchelle G. Pugniere M. Roquet F. Bes C. Bossard C. Chardes T. Peraldi-Roux S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 9560-9569Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The eight amino acids in the region 713-720 were replaced by leucine, and a triple mutant was constructed by replacing the residues Lys713, Pro715, and Glu716 by residues Ser713 and Arg716, derived from the myeloperoxidase sequence, and Ala715. All mutants were constructed by overlap extension PCR as described previously (32Ho S.N. Hunt H.D. Horton R.M. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 77: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (6833) Google Scholar). The final PCR products were cloned into the full-length TPO cDNA by using the unique restriction endonuclease sites ClaI and EcoNI. All sequences were verified by the dideoxynucleotide termination method (33Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52678) Google Scholar). Then, the Flp-In™ system was used to generate isogenic stable Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell lines expressing wt or mutated TPO as we previously described (29Bresson D. Cerutti M. Devauchelle G. Pugniere M. Roquet F. Bes C. Bossard C. Chardes T. Peraldi-Roux S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 9560-9569Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Cloning and expression of TPO fully mutated in the regions 713-720 (TPO713-720) or 506-514 (TPO506-514) were previously described (29Bresson D. Cerutti M. Devauchelle G. Pugniere M. Roquet F. Bes C.

Flow Cytometry Analysis of Wild-type or Mutated TPO Expressed on the Surface of Stably Transfected CHO Cells—Stably transfected CHO cells were scraped, rinsed, and pelleted (5 min, 900 rpm, 4 °C) in PBS supplemented with 2% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum (FACS buffer). The cells were resuspended and incubated with 200 μl of buffer containing 5 μg/ml of a rabbit polyclonal anti-TPO Ab or 2 μg/ml of mAb 47 for 45 min at 4 °C. The cells were washed three times and incubated in 200 μl of FACS buffer with 10 μg/ml of fluorescein-conjugated anti-rabbit (Sigma) or anti-mouse IgG (Rockland, Gilbertsville, PA) for 45 min at 4 °C in the dark. As control, the cells were incubated with second Ab alone. After washing three times with FACS buffer, the cells were analyzed (10,000 events) on an EPICS cytofluorometer (Beckman-Coulter, Fullerton, CA). Membrane Protein Extraction from CHO Cells—Stably transfected or wt CHO cells were washed three times with PBS and scraped at 4 °C. Membrane protein extraction was performed as previously described (29Bresson D. Cerutti M. Devauchelle G. Pugniere M. Roquet F. Bes C. Bossard C. Chardes T. Peraldi-Roux S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 9560-9569Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). After centrifugation at 1,000 rpm for 5 min at 4 °C, membrane proteins were solubilized by adding 500 μl of cold lysis buffer (PBS containing 0.5% Triton X-114 and a protease inhibitor mixture tablet/10 ml of lysis buffer (Roche Applied Science), maintained at 4 °C) per 106 cells, and incubated for 30 min on ice (mixed by vortexing every 10 min). After centrifugation at 800 rpm for 8 min at 4 °C, the supernatants containing the membrane proteins were recovered and incubated for 5 min at 33 °C to allow the separation of the detergent from the aqueous phase. After centrifugation at 800 rpm for 8 min at 22 °C, the upper aqueous phase, containing soluble TPO, was removed and concentrated to ∼10 mg/ml using an Ultrafree®-4 Centrifugal Filter Unit (Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA). All protein concentrations were evaluated by the BCA protein assay reagent (Pierce). Binding of Solubilized Membrane Proteins Containing Wild-type or Mutated TPO to Human Fab Assessed by BIACORE Analysis—Human Fab T13 or TR1.9 were covalently immobilized at 9,600 RU or 3,600 RU, respectively, on flow cells 2 and 3, respectively, of a CM5 sensorchip-activated surface with EDC/NHS (amine coupling kit from Biacore AB). Flow cell 1 was used as the reference control surface. Each solubilized membrane protein extract, containing wt or mutated TPO, was diluted in HBS-EP buffer to the same final total protein concentration (1 mg/ml) and loaded onto flow cells 1, 2, and 3 in a single injection of 90 μl. After dissociation (400 s), eluent buffer (HBS-EP) at a flow rate of 30 μl/min was injected, and then the flow cell surfaces were regenerated with 10 μl of 5 mm HCl. To control the binding stability of the immobilized Fab T13 and TR1.9, each membrane protein analysis was preceded and followed by an injection of solubilized membrane protein extract containing wt TPO under the same conditions. As a negative control, a preparation of membrane proteins obtained from non-transfected CHO cells was diluted to the same final protein concentration and injected over the flow cells. Three independent experiments were performed. Production, Functionality Analysis, and Kinetic Binding Parameters of Human Fab T13—The anti-TPO aAb T13, previously produced as full IgG1 (30Bresson D. Chardes T. Chapal N. Bes C. Cerutti M. Devauchelle G. Bouanani M. Mani J.C. Peraldi-Roux S. Hum. Antibodies. 2001; 10: 109-118Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), was cloned and expressed as human Fab by using the baculovirus/insect cell system as described (34Bes C. Briant-Longuet L. Cerutti M. Heitz F. Troadec S. Pugniere M. Roquet F. Molina F. Casset F. Bresson D. Peraldi-Roux S. Devauchelle G. Devaux C. Granier C. Chardes T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 14265-14273Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Human Fab T13 was purified by protein-G affinity chromatography (purity greater than 95%, data not shown) and then analyzed on 10% SDS-PAGE (Fig. 1A). We observed a 50-kDa band corresponding to human Fab T13, only detectable by the peroxidase-conjugated anti-human Fab Ab but not by the peroxidase-conjugated anti-human Fc-specific Ab (Fig. 1A, lane 3 versus lane 1). Human T13 expressed as full IgG1 could be detected by both secondary Abs (Fig. 1A, lane 2 versus lane 4). Approximately 0.5 mg of purified Fab T13 was obtained per liter of Sf9 insect cell culture supernatant. The functionality of Fab T13 was checked by ELISA. The results clearly show that human Fab T13 was able to bind to hTPO, in a dose-dependent manner, as was the full IgG1 T13 (Fig. 1B). Affinity Measurements of Human Fabs T13, TR1.9, and mAb 47 Binding to TPO—By using BIACORE technology (Fig. 2, A-D), we determined the binding kinetics for the interaction between Fab T13, full IgG1 T13, Fab TR1.9, or mAb 47 and hTPO immobilized on the sensorchip. The kinetic parameters of aAb T13 binding, produced as Fab (Fig. 2A) or full IgG1 (Fig. 2B), were measured after separate injections of five different concentrations of purified aAb on TPO. We found affinities (KD) for IgG1 and Fab T13 of 0.19 ± 0.01 nm and 0.80 ± 0.02 nm, respectively, using the same global fitting model, with a higher association rate constant for aAb T13 expressed as whole IgG1versus Fab and quite similar dissociation rate constants (Fig. 2E). The difference observed between the association rate constants is probably due to a stronger avidity of the full IgG1 (two paratopes) in comparison with the Fab T13 (one paratope). In a previous study (30Bresson D. Chardes T. Chapal N. Bes C. Cerutti M. Devauchelle G. Bouanani M. Mani J.C. Peraldi-Roux S. Hum. Antibodies. 2001; 10: 109-118Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we reported an affinity value for aAb T13 immobilized by an anti-human IgG Fc antibody similar to that of Fab T13, avidity effects being avoided by this protocol. These data confirm the high affinities of human Fabs T13 and TR1.9 for TPO (KD = 0.80 ± 0.02 nm and 0.05 ± 0.01 nm, respectively) (26Guo J. Yan X.M. McLachlan S.M. Rapoport B. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 1327-1333Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The stronger affinity for Fab TR1.9 could be explained by the remarkable association rate constant of human Fab TR1.9 (ka = 64.10 ± 0.02 × 105m-1 s-1) (Fig. 2E). In previous studies, using Scatchard analysis, the affinity of mAb 47 could not be calculated, probably because this mAb binds with a low affinity to TPO (KD less than 10-7m) (13Guo J. Mcintosh R.S. Czarnocka B. Weetman A.P. Rapoport B. McLachlan S.M. Clin. Exp. Immunol. 1998; 111: 408-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). In our experiment (Fig. 2E), this mAb strongly interacted with TPO immobilized on the BIACORE sensor chip and showed high affinity binding with KD = 0.11 ± 0.001 nm, which is similar to that obtained with human Fabs T13 and TR1.9 using the same binding protocol. One explanation for such a difference in the mAb 47 affinity value could be that the Scatchard analysis was performed with soluble and highly convoluted TPO, whereas real-time analysis used a covalently immobilized TPO. Evidence That Human Fabs T13 and TR1.9, as Well as mAb 47, Interact with the Region 713-721 of hTPO—Mouse mAb 47 has been used as reference to describe the B domain of the IDR and often in competition with human anti-TPO aAb (13Guo J.

To understand the nature of such assembly intermediates along with the mechanism of Gag assembly, we employed expression in Escherichia coli and an in vitro assembly reaction. When E. coli expression was performed at 37 °C, Gag predominantly assembled to a high order of multimer, apparently equivalent to the virus-like particles obtained following Gag expression in eukaryotic cells, through the formation of low orders of multimer characterized with a discreet sedimentation value of 60 S. Electron microscopy confirmed the presence of spherical particles in the E. coli cells. In contrast, expression at 30 °C resulted in the production of only the 60 S form of Gag multimer, and crescentshaped structures or small patches with double electron-dense layers were accumulated, but no complete particles. In vitro assembly reactions using purified Gag protein, when performed at 37 °C, also produced the high order of Gag multimers with some 60 S multimers, whereas the 30 °C reaction produced only the 60 S multimers. However, when the 60 S multimers were cross-linked so as not to allow conformational changes, in vitro assembly reactions at 37 °C did not produce any higher order of multimers. ATP depletion did not halt Gag assembly in the E. coli cells, and the addition of GroEL-GroES to in vitro reactions did not facilitate Gag assembly, indicating that conformational changes rather than protein refolding by chaperonins, induced at 37 °C, were solely responsible for the Gag assembly observed here. We suggest that Gag assembles to a capsid through the formation of the 60 S multimer, possibly a key intermediate of the assembly process, accompanied with conformational changes in Gag.

The major structural component of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), 1The abbreviations used are: HIV, human immunodeficiency virus; VLP, virus-like particle; MA, matrix/membrane; CA, capsid; NC, nucleocapsid; DTBP, dimethyl 3,3′-dithiobispropionimidate; IPTG, isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside; DSP, dithiobis. Gag, is the sole protein required for viral particle budding, and expression of Gag protein alone in eukaryotic cells produces Gag virus-like particle (VLP), morphologically identical to the immature form of HIV particles (1Gheysen D.

The process of Gag assembly is thought to consist of N-terminal myristoylation of Gag followed by relocation to the plasma membrane and multimerization of Gag to form VLP. Three discrete Gag regions responsible for virus particle production have been identified by genetic studies and termed the membrane-binding, the interacting, and the late domains. The membrane-binding domain is located at the N-terminal matrix/membrane (MA) of Gag and contains a bipartite membrane-binding signal (N-terminal myristoylation and a cluster of basic amino acids) that directs the association of Gag with membrane (1Gheysen D. Jacobs E. de Foresta F. Thiriart C. Francotte M. Thines D. De Wilde M. Cell. 1989; 59: 103-112Google Scholar, 4Bryant M. Ratner L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The interacting domain is essential for Gag-Gag interactions and spans from the central capsid (CA) to nucleocapsid (NC) of Gag (6Carriere C. Gay B. Chazal N. Morin N. Boulanger P. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 2366-2377Google Scholar, 7Dorfman T. Bukovsky A. Ohagen A. Hoglund S. Gottlinger H.G. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 8180-8187Google Scholar, 8Mammano F. Ohagen A. Hoglund S. Gottlinger H.G. J.

The late domain, responsible for pinching off viral particles from the membrane, has been found in the C-terminal p6 domain of Gag (10Gottlinger H.G. Dorfman T. Sodroski J.G. Haseltine W.A. Proc.

Cell. 1989; 59: 103-112Google Scholar, 2Hoshikawa N. Kojima A. Yasuda A. Takayashiki E. Masuko S. Chiba J. Sata T. Kurata T. J. Gen. Virol. 1991; 72: 2509-2517Google Scholar). An HIV particle is composed of ∼2000 Gag molecules (12Forster M.J. Mulloy B. Nermut M.V. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 298: 841-857Google Scholar) that are arranged in a high order form. In fact, studies by high resolution electron microscopy have revealed that Gag molecules are arranged in a fullerene- or cage-like network consisting of hexagonal and trigonal units (13Fuller S.D. Wilk T. Gowen B.E. Krausslich H.G. Vogt V.M. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 729-738Google Scholar, 14Nermut M.V. Hockley D.J. Jowett J.B. Jones I.M. Garreau M. Thomas D. Virology. 1994; 198: 288-296Google Scholar), suggesting the ordered multimerization of Gag in a virus particle. However, little is known about the mechanisms involved in the formation of Gag capsid. The process of building Gag up into capsid remains to be elucidated and includes such questions as whether assembly consists of multiple sets of reactions involving discrete intermediates or a single sequential reaction and, in both cases, what the mechanism of Gag multimerization might be. A number of electron microscopy studies to date have provided evidence for electron-dense Gag layers underneath the plasma membrane and nascent particles connected to the cell surface by a thin stalk (15Gelderblom H.R. AIDS. 1991; 5: 617-638Google Scholar), suggesting that Gag assembles following membrane targeting and also suggesting that assembly intermediates, if any, would be similarly present on the membrane. Consistent with these observations, membrane-bound Gag complexes have been resolved on Optiprep density gradients (16Tritel M. Resh M.D. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 5845-5855Google Scholar). However, recent observations of Gag-expressing cells have revealed the occurrence of Gag complexes in the cytoplasm, suggesting Gag multimer formation prior to membrane relocation (17Perrin-Tricaud C. Davoust J. Jones I.M. Virology. 1999; 255: 20-25Google Scholar, 18Wang J.J. Sandefur S. Spearman P. Chiou C.T. Chiang P.H. Ratner L. Appl. Immunohistochem. Mol. Morphol. 2001; 9: 371-379Google Scholar). Similarly, data based on the detergent sensitivity of Gag complexes have suggested a detergent-resistant complex in the cytosol (19Lee Y.M. Yu X.F. Virology. 1998; 243: 78-93Google Scholar, 20Lee Y.M. Liu B. Yu X.F. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 5654-5662Google Scholar), although these cytosolic Gag complexes may possibly be a dead end product (16Tritel M. Resh M.D. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 5845-5855Google Scholar, 21Nermut M.V. Zhang W.-H. Francis G. Ciamporx F. Morikawa Y. Jones I.M. Virology. 2003; 305: 219-227Google Scholar). These apparently conflicting results argue that the morphogenetic pathway of Gag assembly is not as clear cut as is commonly thought, but the data clearly show that some level of Gag multimer, plausibly assembly intermediates, occur during particle assembly. The definition of such intermediates would lead to a better understanding of the sequential nature of the Gag assembly reactions. As a result of the lack of host N-myristoyltransferase, Gag expression in Escherichia coli confers neither N-myristoylation (22Duronio R.J. Jackson-Machelski E. Heuckeroth R.O. Olins P.O. Devine C.S. Yonemoto W. Slice L.W. Taylor S.S. Gordon J.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 1506-1510Google Scholar) nor subsequent membrane relocation on the molecule but yields spherical particles inside the E. coli cells (23Morikawa Y. Kinoshita A. Goto T. Tomoda H. Sano K. Virology. 2001; 283: 343-352Google Scholar). The particles are a hollow sphere surrounded by an electron-dense ring structure, similar to the immature form of HIV VLPs produced by Gag expression in eukaryotic cells (24Gross I. Hohenberg H. Huckhagel C. Krausslich H.G. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 4798-4810Google Scholar). Interestingly, spherical particles with similar morphologies are also produced when purified soluble Gag protein is subjected to in vitro assembly reactions (25Campbell S. Rein A. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 2270-2279Google Scholar, 26Morikawa Y. Goto T. Sano K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 27997-28002Google Scholar), although the particle sizes are heterogeneous when compared with those of VLPs produced by eukaryotic cells. Similar findings have been reported for other retroviral Gags (27Campbell S. Vogt V.M. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 4425-4435Google Scholar, 28Klikova M. Rhee S.S. Hunter E. Ruml T. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 1093-1098Google Scholar). These data show that the assembly phenotypes of Gag produced by expression in E. coli as well as by in vitro reaction mimic the authentic Gag assembly observed in eukaryotic cells and suggest that the assembly reaction is driven by the intrinsic properties of Gag protein. Similar conclusions were made when experiments were carried out with Gag fragments (e.g. MA-CA, CA, and CA-NC). For example, CA and CA-NC formed tubular or conical structures by in vitro assembly, and E. coli expression of these fragments yielded tubular structures in the cells, both of which may represent conical cores of mature HIV particles observed following Gag processing (24Gross I. Hohenberg H. Huckhagel C. Krausslich H.G. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 4798-4810Google Scholar, 29Ganser B.K. Li S. Klishko V.Y. Finch J.T. Sundquist W.I. Science. 1999; 283: 80-83Google Scholar, 30von Schwedler U.K. Stemmler T.L. Klishko V.Y. Li S. Albertine K.H. Davis D.R. Sundquist W.I. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1555-1568Google Scholar). We have shown previously, using purified Gag protein lacking the C-terminal p6 domain, that the in vitro assembly reaction is composed of two sequential steps: the formation of a 60 S complex, possibly an assembly intermediate, and complete assembly to 600 S, equivalent to the immature form of HIV capsids (26Morikawa Y. Goto T. Sano K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 27997-28002Google Scholar). Although the ideal for study of Gag assembly would be in higher eukaryotic cell expression systems, the level of Gag expression in such systems is often insufficient for biochemical and structural analyses, and neither expression nor assembly of Gag is synchronized. To examine the nature of assembly intermediates along with the mechanism of assembly, we have employed an inducible expression system of E. coli and in vitro assembly reaction. Our data show that the 60 S forms of Gag multimers have a defined structure and detergent sensitivity, suggesting that they may be genuine Gag assembly intermediates. The data also suggest that the Gag assembly process may be accompanied by conformational changes in Gag. Materials—E. coli expression vector pTrcHisA was purchased from Invitrogen, and metal chelate resin (HisBind Resin) was from Novagen. Sephadex G-25 (PD-10) and a high molecular weight calibration kit were purchased from Amersham Biosciences. Eukaryotic 80 S ribosome was kindly supplied by Kiyohisa Mizumoto (Kitasato University, Japan), and the immature forms of HIV Gag VLPs were purified from culture medium of Spodoptera frugiperda (Sf 9) cells infected with a recombinant baculovirus containing the HIV-1 gag gene (31Morikawa Y. Hockley D.J. Nermut M.V. Jones I.M. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 16-23Google Scholar). Anti-HIV-1 CA mouse monoclonal antibody was obtained from Advanced Biotechnologies. Dithiobis (DSP) and dimethyl 3,3′-dithiobispropionimidate (DTBP) were purchased from Pierce Biotechnology, and GroEL-GroES mixture was from TaKaRa Shuzo Co. Ltd. Other reagents were commercially available of analytical grade. DNA Construction and Protein Expression—The HIV-1 gag gene encoding the Gag region essential for virus particle formation (MA-CA-p2-NC) with the additional 6 histidine residues at the C terminus was cloned into E. coli expression vector pTrcHisA, as described previously (26Morikawa Y. Goto T. Sano K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 27997-28002Google Scholar). Transformed E. coli cells were cultured at 37 and 30 °C. Protein expression was carried out by the addition of isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) at the log phase of E. coli growth. For ATP depletion, NaN3 was added to the culture medium following IPTG induction, a method that was described previously (32Kihara A. Ito K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 45: 19770-19775Google Scholar, 33van der Wolk J.P. de Wit J.G. Driessen A.J. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 7297-7304Google Scholar). Preparation of Whole Cell Lysates and Protein Purification—For preparation of whole cell lysates, E. coli cells were harvested by centrifugation at 4 °C at 8,000 × g for 15 min and suspended in 50 mm Tris (pH 8.0), 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, and 1 mm dithiothreitol. Following sonication at 4 °C for 15 min, the cells were lysed by the addition of 0.1% Nonidet P-40 and incubated at room temperature for 10 min in the presence of 10 μg/ml RNaseA. For protein purification, E. coli cells were suspended in binding buffer (20 mm Tris (pH 7.9), 150 mm NaCl, and 10 mm imidazole). Disruption by sonication, the addition of Nonidet P-40, and RNaseA treatment were carried out as before. The cell lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C, and the supernatants were subjected to metal chelate chromatography (Novagen). Following extensive wash with binding buffer and subsequently with wash buffer (20 mm Tris (pH 7.9), 150 mm NaCl, and 60 mm imidazole), bound protein was eluted with elute buffer (20 mm Tris (pH 7.9), 150 mm NaCl, and 1 m imidazole). The details of the purification protocol have been described previously (26Morikawa Y. Goto T. Sano K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 27997-28002Google Scholar). In Vitro Assembly Reaction—In vitro assembly reaction of purified Gag protein was performed as described previously (26Morikawa Y. Goto T. Sano K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 27997-28002Google Scholar). In brief, following metal chelate chromatography, eluted fractions were desalted using Sephadex G-25 (PD-10) equilibrated with buffer A (20 mm Tris (pH 8.6 adjusted at room temperature), 100 mm NaCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, 5 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm dithiothreitol). For in vitro assembly, the desalted fractions were incubated at either 37 or 30 °C for 3 h. In some experiments, assembly intermediates of Gag were incubated in the presence of 10% (v/v) glycerol (see the legend for Fig. 8) or incubated with GroEL-GroES (with a Gag-to-GroEL-GroES molar ratio of 1:1) in the presence of 1 mm ATP or ATP-γS (see the legend for Fig. 10).Fig. 1Time courses of Gag expression in E. coli. E. coli was grown at 37 °C (left panels) and 30 °C (right panels). Following the addition of IPTG, cells were harvested at intervals. The cells were resuspended in 50 mm Tris (pH 8.0), 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, and 1 mm dithiothreitol and disrupted by sonication. Subcellular fractionation was carried out by centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 30 min. Equal proportions of the whole cell lysates, the pellets, and the supernatants were analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining (upper panels) and Western blotting using anti-HIV-1 CA antibody (lower panels). The lanes are as follows: M, prestained molecular mass markers; No, E. coli transformed with a parental expression vector pTrcHisA; 0–4, E. coli transformed with the HIV-1 gag gene-containing vector. 0 shows before induction, and 1, 2, and 4 show h after induction, respectively.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Fig. 10Effect of GroEL/GroES on higher order assembly. Gag assembly intermediates were incubated at 37 °C for 1 h without (top panel) or with 0.3–0.5 mg/ml GroEL/GroES in the presence of 1 mm ATP (middle panel) or ATP-γS (bottom panel). The products were analyzed on 20–70% (w/v) sucrose gradients by centrifugation at 120,000 × g for 2 h at 4 °C. Gradient fractions from the bottom to the top (left to right) were subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by Western blotting using anti-HIV-1 CA antibody. Arrows show sedimented positions of the immature form of HIV capsids (600 S) and 80 S ribosomes. Lane M shows prestained molecular mass markers for SDS-PAGE.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Cross-linking—For cross-linking, assembly intermediates of Gag were dialyzed against phosphate-buffered saline (pH 8.0) (for cross-linking with DSP) or 0.2 m triethanolamine (pH 8.0) (for cross-linking with DTBP). DSP or DTBP was added to a final concentration of 1 mm, and the mixtures were incubated at room temperature for 30 min. After quenching with 50 mm Tris (pH 8.0), the materials were dialyzed in buffer A and subjected to in vitro assembly reactions at 37 °C for 3 h. Gradient Analysis—Protein was applied onto a 15–35% (w/v) sucrose gradient and sedimented in an SW55 rotor (Beckman Coulter) at 150,000 × g for 4 h at 4 °C. Alternatively, the protein sample was applied onto a 20–70% (w/v) sucrose gradient and sedimented in an SW55 rotor at 120,000 × g for 2 h at 4 °C. After centrifugation, the gradients were fractionated from the bottom to the top. A high molecular mass calibration kit (Amersham Biosciences), 80 S ribosome, and the immature form of HIV Gag VLPs purified from the supernatant of Gag-expressing Sf 9 cells were used for molecular mass markers for sedimentation analyses. Treatment with Detergent and Urea—Assembly intermediates of Gag were treated with 0.5% Triton X-100, 0.1 or 1.0% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, or 6 m urea at room temperature for 15 min. Following treatment, the materials were centrifuged in an SW55 rotor at 220,000 × g for 4 h at 4 °C. As a control, the immature form of HIV Gag VLP purified from the supernatant of Gag-expressing Sf 9 cells was similarly treated with the detergents or urea. Protein Detection—Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and detected by Coomassie Brilliant Blue or silver staining or subjected to Western blotting using anti-HIV-1 CA monoclonal antibody. Electron Microscopic Examination—Electron microscopic examination was carried out by the standard procedures. Assembly intermediates were collected by centrifugation in an SW55 rotor at 220,000 × g for 4 h at 4 °C and fixed with 2% glutaraldehyde and subsequently with 1% osmium tetroxide. Ultrathin sections were stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate. Time Courses of HIV Gag Expression and Assembly in E. coli—The HIV-1 gag gene with the additional sequence encoding 6 histidine residues at the C terminus was cloned into pTrcHisA vector and used for Gag expression in E. coli cells, as described previously (26Morikawa Y. Goto T. Sano K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 27997-28002Google Scholar). E. coli was grown at 37 and 30 °C, and protein expression was induced by the addition of IPTG. To monitor Gag expression, whole cell lysates were prepared at 1-, 2-, and 4-h time points following IPTG induction and subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining (Fig. 1, upper) and Western blotting with anti-HIV-1 CA antibody (Fig. 1, lower). The levels of Gag expression were broadly equivalent with similar kinetics between the two temperatures (Fig. 1, whole cells). However, when the cell lysates were subjected to subcellular fractionation by centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 30 min, striking differences were observed between the two temperatures. In the 37 °C samples, Gag antigens were initially found in the supernatant but recovered in the pellets after 2 h of induction (Fig. 1, left). In contrast, when E. coli was maintained at 30 °C, Gags were constantly recovered in the supernatants throughout the period observed here (up to 4 h) (Fig. 1B). It has been reported for Mason-Pfizer monkey virus that Gag assembles to spherical particles in E. coli and forms inclusion bodies, which were precipitated by centrifugation under similar conditions (28Klikova M. Rhee S.S. Hunter E. Ruml T. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 1093-1098Google Scholar). To examine whether the temperature-dependent differences may represent the assembly state of the expressed Gag protein, sedimentation experiments using sucrose gradients were carried out. Whole cell lysates made at each time point were clarified by brief centrifugation at 1,000 × g for 3 min and then sedimented through 20–70% sucrose gradients at 120,000 × g for 2 h. Gag antigens spread within the gradients were detected by Western blotting. When the 37 °C samples were analyzed, a progression of Gag toward heavier gradient fractions was apparent with increasing incubation times (Fig. 2A, left). Gag antigens were initially found at the top of the gradient but, at 2 h after induction, sedimented to 50% sucrose fractions with a trace of Gag in the 25–30% sucrose fractions. By 4 h, the mobility shift to 50% sucrose fractions was largely complete. In contrast, when E. coli was maintained at 30 °C, Gag antigens were initially found at the top of the gradient and later shifted to the 25–30% sucrose fractions but not to the 50% sucrose fractions (Fig. 2A, right). These data show that at 37 °C, synthesized Gag forms a large complex from relatively small molecular weight complexes, whereas in contrast, at 30 °C, Gag remains in relatively small complexes. Electron microscopy was carried out to examine whether the Gag complexes identified by gradient analysis had defined structures. Doughnut-like particles, typical of the immature form of Gag capsids, were observed in the E. coli cells maintained at 37 °C (Fig. 2B, left), confirming previous reports in which retroviral Gag protein (e.g. Mason-Pfizer monkey virus, Rous sarcoma virus, and HIV) assemble into VLPs inside E. coli cells (24Gross I. Hohenberg H. Huckhagel C. Krausslich H.G. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 4798-4810Google Scholar, 27Campbell S. Vogt V.M. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 4425-4435Google Scholar, 28Klikova M. Rhee S.S. Hunter E. Ruml T. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 1093-1098Google Scholar). In contrast, no particles were seen in E. coli cells when maintained at 30 °C (Fig. 2B, right). Sedimentation Profiles of Assembly Intermediates—To enrich the small complex form of Gag, E. coli cells were harvested at each time point after IPTG induction, and Gags were purified from the supernatants of the cell lysates by use of the Gag C-terminal polyhistidine tag. Following metal chelate chromatography, the eluted fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining (Fig. 3, upper) and Western blotting with anti-HIV-1 CA antibody (Fig. 3, lower). When the E. coli cells were maintained at 30 °C, Gag could be purified at all time points after induction. In contrast, at 37 °C, Gag was purified only at 1 h but not at any later time points. As Gag forms a large complex with increasing incubation times in 37 °C-cultured E. coli, the purification failure is consistent with the inaccessibility of the polyhistidine tag to the metal chelate resin. Each purified Gag was directly subjected to sedimentation analysis on 20–70% sucrose gradients, and fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by silver staining (Fig. 4, left). When the 1-h samples were analyzed, both Gags (purified from 37- and 30 °C-cultured E. coli) were found at the top of the gradient (Fig. 4, left, 37 °C, 1 h and 30 °C, 1 h). In contrast, the 4-h sample (purified from 30 °C-cultured E. coli) sedimented to 25–30% sucrose fractions (Fig. 4, left, 30 °C, 4 h), showing that by 4 h after induction, Gag forms a small complex that could still be purified by chromatography. The molecular mass of the small Gag complex was determined by subsequent sedimentation analysis on 15–35% sucrose gradients (Fig. 4, right). When compared with molecular mass markers and 80 S ribosomes sedimented in parallel, the small Gag complex was detected in fractions corresponding to 60 S (Fig. 4, right, 30 °C, 4 h), whereas the Gags of 1-h samples were detected in much lower molecular mass fractions (Fig. 4, right, 37 °C, 1 h and 30 °C, 1 h) corresponding to the monomeric form of Gag observed in our previous studies (26Morikawa Y. Goto T. Sano K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 27997-28002Google Scholar). A number of studies have demonstrated that in vitro assembly using purified Gag forms spherical particles, remarkably similar to the immature form of retroviral capsids (25Campbell S. Rein A. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 2270-2279Google Scholar, 27Campbell S. Vogt V.M. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 4425-4435Google Scholar, 28Klikova M. Rhee S.S. Hunter E. Ruml T. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 1093-1098Google Scholar). We have also shown that, in an in vitro assembly reaction, Gag forms a 60 S multimer that subsequently shifts to 600 S, equivalent to the immature form of HIV capsids, suggesting that the 60 S multimer may represent an assembly intermediate during capsid formation (26Morikawa Y. Goto T. Sano K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 27997-28002Google Scholar). As expression in E. coli cells at 37 °C allowed the production of both large and small Gag complexes, but at 30 °C, allowed only the small complex (Fig. 2), we tested whether Gag assembly in vitro is similarly temperature-dependent. Monomeric Gag was purified following 1 h of IPTG induction and subjected to the in vitro assembly reaction described previously (26Morikawa Y. Goto T. Sano K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 27997-28002Google Scholar). The in vitro assembly products were analyzed on 20–70% sucrose gradients and compared with 80 S ribosomes and the immature form of HIV capsids sedimented in parallel. When the in vitro assembly reaction was carried out at 30 °C, Gag, whether derived from E. coli cultured at 37 or 30 °C, sedimented to a position corresponding to 60 S (Fig. 5, middle). In contrast, when the reaction was carried out at 37 °C, the sedimentation profiles for both Gags were shifted essentially to that of the immature form of Gag capsids, although a small fraction of Gag was still observed at 60 S (Fig. 5, bottom). These data indicate that, in our in vitro assembly system, the 30 °C reaction produces only 60 S Gag multimers and that higher order assembly requires incubation at 37 °C, paralleling the Gag assembly observed in E. coli cells. The data from the in vitro system also show that the levels of Gag assembly were dependent on the temperatures of the in vitro reaction but not on the temperatures at which the Gags were purified from E. coli. Morphology of Assembly Intermediates—Electron microscopic examination was used to examine whether the 60 S Gag complex had a defined structure. E. coli-produced 60 S complex was purified by metal chelate chromatography from E. coli following 4 h of IPTG induction at 30 °C, and in vitro-assembled 60 S complex was prepared by in vitro reaction at 30 °C for 3 h using purified monomeric Gag protein. When observed by ultrathin section transmission microscopy, the E. coli-produced 60 S complex did not exhibit doughnut-like structures but rather exhibited crescent-shaped structures with double electron-dense layers. The structures very often resembled small patches of electron-dense materials observed under the plasma membrane of Gag-expressing eukaryotic cells (Fig. 6A). The in vitro-assembled 60 S complex showed a similar structure. The complex formed electron-dense structures with a gentle curvature, although the contours of the structures were not as sharp when compared wit"
https://openalex.org/W2048385139,"Cadmium is a well known environmental toxicant and carcinogen. To identify proteins involved in cellular adaptive responses to cadmium, we established cadmium-adapted U937 cells that exhibit resistance to cadmium-induced apoptosis, and we performed comparative proteome analysis of these cells with parental cells that were either untreated or treated with cadmium. Newly identified proteins that were changed in expression level in both adapted cells and cadmium-treated parental cells included proteins implicated in cell proliferation and malignant transformation. Most interesting, a calcium-binding protein calbindin-D28k was increased only in the adapted cells but not in cadmium-exposed parental cells. The level of calbindin-D28k increased by the degree of cadmium adaptation and was stably maintained without selective pressure of cadmium. Cadmium-adapted U937 cells were resistant to the toxic effects of cytosolic calcium rise by cadmium treatment and by depletion of intracellular calcium stores, suggesting that enhanced calcium buffering by up-regulated calbindin-D28k may be responsible for acquiring resistance to cadmium-induced apoptosis. We demonstrated that overexpression of calbindin-D28k in MN9D neuronal cells resulted in reduced cadmium-induced apoptosis. Our study documents for the first time that cells respond to long term cadmium exposure by increasing calbindin-D28k expression, thereby attenuating cadmium-induced apoptosis.

Our study documents for the first time that cells respond to long term cadmium exposure by increasing calbindin-D28k expression, thereby attenuating cadmium-induced apoptosis. Cadmium is a long-lived environmental hazard with potent multiorgan toxicity that is well recognized as an industrial pollutant and a food contaminant and as one of the major components of cigarette smoke (1Morselt A.F. Toxicology. 1991; 70: 1-132Google Scholar). Cadmium is taken up through calcium ion channels of the plasma membrane and can affect calcium homeostasis by activating or inhibiting several calcium-related enzymes (2Beyersmann D. Hechtenberg S. Toxicol. Appl. Pharmacol. 1997; 144: 247-261Google Scholar). Following cadmium uptake, damage to cells leads to a complex series of events that can culminate in the death of the cells. To attenuate cadmium toxicity, cells respond by inducing a variety of genes and by modulating the expression levels or activities of proteins. These include proteins that (i) sequester cadmium to decrease the availability of this ion from interacting with cellular targets to elicit toxicity, such as metallothioneins (MT) 1The abbreviations used are: MT, metallothionein; MALDI, matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization; TOF, time of flight; MTT, 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-y1)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide; annexin V/FITC, fluorescence isothiocyanate-labeled annexin V; PI, propidium iodide; IEF, isoelectric focusing; RhoGDI-α, Rho GDP dissociation inhibitor-α; RanBP1, Ran-binding protein 1; MNEI, monocyte/neutrophil elastase inhibitor; MTA-1s, metastatic tumor antigen-1 short form; PARP, poly-(ADP-ribose) polymerase; Ab, antibody; DTT, dithiothreitol; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; BAPTA, 1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N′, N′-tetraacetic acid; CHAPS, 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid. 1The abbreviations used are: MT, metallothionein; MALDI, matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization; TOF, time of flight; MTT, 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-y1)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide; annexin V/FITC, fluorescence isothiocyanate-labeled annexin V; PI, propidium iodide; IEF, isoelectric focusing; RhoGDI-α, Rho GDP dissociation inhibitor-α; RanBP1, Ran-binding protein 1; MNEI, monocyte/neutrophil elastase inhibitor; MTA-1s, metastatic tumor antigen-1 short form; PARP, poly-(ADP-ribose) polymerase; Ab, antibody; DTT, dithiothreitol; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; BAPTA, 1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N′, N′-tetraacetic acid; CHAPS, 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid.; (ii) control GSH and related proteins to detoxify reactive oxygen species that are generated by cadmium; (iii) repair membrane and DNA damage; and (iv) renature or degrade unfolded proteins (3Waisberg M. Joseph P. Hale B. Beyersmann D. Toxicology. 2003; 192: 95-117Google Scholar). Cadmium can induce apoptosis in vivo and in vitro, as shown in cells of the respiratory system (4Hart B.A. Lee C.H. Shukla G.S. Shukla A. Osier M. Eneman J.D. Chiu J.F. Toxicology. 1999; 133: 43-58Google Scholar), the testis (5Xu C. Johnson J.E. Singh P.K. Jones M.M. Yan H. Carter C.E. Toxicology. 1996; 107: 1-8Google Scholar), the kidney (6Ishido M. Homma S.T. Leung P.S. Tohyama C. Life Sci. 1995; 56: PL351-PL356Google Scholar), the liver (7Habeebu S.S. Liu J. Klaassen C.D. Toxicol. Appl. Pharmacol. 1998; 149: 203-209Google Scholar), and the immune system (8el Azzouzi B. Tsangaris G.T. Pellegrini O. Manuel Y. Benveniste J. Thomas Y. Toxicology. 1994; 88: 127-139Google Scholar, 9Tsangaris G.T. Tzortzatou-Stathopoulou F. Toxicology. 1998; 128: 143-150Google Scholar). Although a high dose of cadmium exposure of cells can induce apoptosis, low dose of cadmium stimulates DNA synthesis, cell proliferation, and malignant transformation (2Beyersmann D. Hechtenberg S. Toxicol. Appl. Pharmacol. 1997; 144: 247-261Google Scholar). Upon repeated exposure of cells with increasing doses of cadmium, cells exhibit adaptive survival responses that have enabled many cells to become more resistant to subsequent high doses of cadmium. The cellular adaptation process involves the suppression of apoptosis induced by this metal. For example, cadmium-adapted alveolar epithelial cells, which have up-regulated expression of MT, GSH, and antioxidant enzymes, showed better protection against oxidant-induced apoptosis compared with the nonadapted cells (10Eneman J.D. Potts R.J. Osier M. Shukla G.S. Lee C.H. Chiu J.F. Hart B.A. Toxicology. 2000; 147: 215-228Google Scholar). In addition, cadmium-transformed prostate epithelial cell line exhibited down-regulated gene expression of caspases and pro-apoptotic Bax and up-regulation of anti-apoptotic BCL-2 gene, when compared with the nontumorigenic parental line (11Achanzar W.E. Webber M.M. Waalkes M.P. Prostate. 2002; 52: 236-244Google Scholar), suggesting that acquired resistance to apoptosis plays a role in cell transformation and malignant progression. In the present study, in order to gain further insights into the mechanism for cellular long term survival response to cadmium, we have searched proteins associated with cadmium adaptation by the use of proteomics. Two cell lines of U937 cells were used for proteome comparison, a parental cell line and a cadmium-adapted cell line. The proteins were separated by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis for proteome analysis. Protein spots altered in cadmium-adapted cells were identified by peptide mass fingerprinting using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight (MALDI-TOF)-mass spectrometry. Remarkably, calbindin-D28k was increased only in the adapted cells but not in parental cells treated with cadmium, suggesting that this protein is a secondary cadmium-responsive protein. Calbindin-D28k has been known to possess an anti-apoptotic function by chelating calcium (12Dowd D.R. MacDonald P.N. Komm B.S. Haussler M.R. Miesfeld R.L. Mol. Endocrinol. 1992; 6: 1843-1848Google Scholar, 13McMahon A. Wong B.S. Iacopino A.M. Ng M.C. Chi S. German D.C. Brain Res. Mol. Brain Res. 1998; 54: 56-63Google Scholar, 14Orrenius S. Nicotera P. J.

Brain Res. 1999; 64: 69-79Google Scholar). We demonstrated that the adapted cells showed better calcium buffering capacity than nonadapted cells, and its overexpression in neuronal cells protected cells from apoptosis induced by cadmium. Thus, increased expression of calbindinD28k represents an adaptive survival mechanism that resists cadmium-induced apoptosis. Reagents—All reagents used for cell culture were purchased from Invitrogen. Electrophoresis reagents including acrylamide solution (40%), Tris base, glycine, Immobiline DryStrip, IPG buffer, and IPG cover fluid were purchased from Amersham Biosciences. Trypsin (sequencing grade) was purchased from Promega (Madison, WI). Thapsigargin, Pluronic F-127, Fluo-2/AM, BTC-5N/AM and BAPTA-AM were from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). CdCl2, ionomycin, CHAPS, acetonitrile, trifluoroacetic acid, α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid, and other reagents were purchased from Sigma. Cell Culture and Establishment of Cadmium-adapted U937 Cells— The human monocytic cell line U937 was obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). Cells were grown at 37 °C with 5% CO2 in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 2% sodium bicarbonate, 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin G, and 50 μg/ml streptomycin. Cadmium-adapted cells were developed by stepwise exposure of parental U937 cells to cadmium with concentration ranging from 5 to 50 μm. Cells surviving from the medium containing 5 μm CdCl2 were maintained for 2 weeks until normal growth rate was recovered. These cells were exposed to a subsequent higher concentration of cadmium that was increased by 5 μm at each step. MN9D neuronal cells overexpressing calbindin-D28k (MN9D/cal-D28k) were cultured as described (17Choi W.S. Chun S.Y. Markelonis G.J. Oh T.H. Oh Y.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 287: 656-661Google Scholar). MTT Assay—Cell cytotoxicity induced by cadmium and other reagents was quantified by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-y1)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) reduction assay, as described previously (18Shearman M.S. Ragan C.I. Iversen L.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 1470-1474Google Scholar). Cells were seeded in 96-well plates (104 cells/well) 1 day before treatment. The cells were then treated with CdCl2 for various times and concentrations. After incubation with the reagent, the cells were treated with 1 mg/ml MTT solution at a CO2 incubator for 2 h at 37 °C and lysed in 20% SDS in 50% aqueous dimethylformamide for 24 h. The absorbance of the dissolved formazan grains within the cells was measured at 540 nm in a microplate reader (Molecular Devices, Palo Alto, CA). Values from each treatment were calculated as percent cytotoxicity of the untreated control. Flow Cytometric Assessment of Apoptosis—Phosphatidylserine externalization during cadmium-induced apoptosis in U937 cells was determined by two-color analysis of annexin V/FITC binding and propidium iodide (PI) uptake using flow cytometry (FACSCalibur, BD Biosciences) according to the instructions of the manufacturer. Annexin V-FITC detection kit and PI staining solution were purchased from BD Biosciences. Two-dimensional Gel Electrophoresis and Image Analysis—Protein samples for two-dimensional gel electrophoresis were extracted as followed. Cells were lysed in extraction buffer (7 m urea, 2 m thiourea, 4% CHAPS, 40 mm Tris base, 20 mm DTT, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1% IPG buffer) at 4 °C for 30 min. The lysate was then centrifuged at 15,000 rpm for 30 min at 4 °C. The supernatants were collected and treated with 250 units/ml endonuclease (Sigma) for1hat room temperature. The first-dimensional isoelectric focusing (IEF) was performed on an IPGphor unit (Amersham Biosciences) using precasted 24-cm pH 4–7 IPG gel strips. 2 mg of total proteins was dissolved to 350 μl with rehydration buffer (7 m urea, 2 m thiourea, 2% CHAPS, 40 mm Tris base, 10 mm DTT, 0.02% bromphenol blue, and 1% IPG buffer) and rehydrated at 20 °C for more than 12 h at 30 V. IEF was performed in a stepwise voltage increase procedure at 20 °C to achieve a total of 100,000 V-h. After IEF separation, the gel strips were incubated with equilibration buffer (50 mm Tris, 6 m urea, 20% v/v glycerol, 2% w/v SDS, and 1% DTT) for 15 min followed by incubation in the same buffer with DTT replaced by 1.25% iodoacetamide (w/v) for an additional 15 min. The second dimension separation was performed on 1.0-mm-thick gradient polyacrylamide gels at 15 mA per gel at 10 °C overnight using a DALT electrophoresis unit (Amersham Biosciences). The gels were stained with colloidal Coomassie Blue. The stained gels were scanned and analyzed using Melanie 3 software (GeneBio, Geneva, Switzerland). In-gel Digestion for Protein Identification—Each excised gel spot was destained with 100 μl of 50% acetonitrile in 25 mm ammonium bicarbonate (NH4HCO3). The solution was replaced with a fresh aliquot, and the gel spots were incubated with shaking for 10 min at 37 °C. The above washing and dehydration steps were repeated three times. After removal of the dehydration solution, gel spots were dried in a Speed-Vac. The dried gel spots were incubated with 10–15 μl of 20 ng/μl trypsin in 25 mm NH4HCO3 on ice for 45 min, and then the supernatant was discarded and replaced with 25 mm NH4HCO3. The trypsin digestion was performed at 37 °C for 14–18 h. Peptides were first extracted using 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, 50% acetonitrile at 37 °C for 30 min, and the above procedure was repeated twice and then the peptides were extracted subsequently with 100% acetonitrile. The extracted solutions were dried in a Speed-Vac. MALDI-TOF-Mass Spectrometry and Data Base Searching—The extracted peptides were dissolved in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, mixed with an equal volume of matrix solution (10 mg/ml α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, 50% acetonitrile), and 1 μlofthe mixture was spotted onto a MALDI sample plate. Peptide mass spectra were obtained using an Applied Biosystem Voyager-DE STR MALDI-TOF mass spectrometer in the reflector mode. External calibration was carried out by using Sequazyme peptide mass standard kit (Perspective Biosystems) and internal calibration by using the autolytic peaks of trypsin. The protein identification was performed by searching the NCBInr protein data base using MS-Fit (prospector.ucsf.edu/). The criteria for searching were set at 50 ppm, at least four matching peptide masses, and theoretical molecular mass and pI matching estimated values from gels. Western Blot Analysis—Cells were washed with PBS and lysed in SDS sample buffer (62.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, 5% 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.002% bromphenol blue, and 10% glycerol). The samples were boiled for 5 min and centrifuged at 12,000 rpm for 3 min, and equal amounts of proteins (20–50 μg) were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. The membranes were blocked with TBS (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl) containing 5% nonfat milk for 1 h at room temperature and then incubated with various Abs for 1 h at room temperature. After they were washed with TBST (TBS plus 0.025% Tween 20), the membranes were incubated with the horseradish peroxidase-labeled secondary Ab for 1 h. After washing, the blots were treated with ECL reagents (Amersham Biosciences), followed by exposure to x-ray film. Abs used are anti-calbindin-D28k Ab (Swant, Bellinzona, Switzerland), anti-caspase 3 Abs (murine-specific, Cell Signaling, Beverly, MA; human-specific, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), anti-caspase-8 Ab (BD Biosciences), and mouse monoclonal PARP Ab (Roche Applied Science). Measurement of the Level of Cytosolic Calcium and Cadmium—Cells for intracellular calcium measurements were preloaded with the cytosolic calcium indicator, 5 μm Fura-2/AM plus 0.1% Pluronic F-127, for 30 min at room temperature and washed with RPMI 1640 (serum- and phenol red-free). Cells were resuspended in black opaque 96-well plates (2 × 104/well) in RPMI 1640 and treated with 20 or 50 μm CdCl2 for the times indicated at 37 °C. Fluorescence was monitored on a Bio-Tek FL600 fluorescence absorbance spectrophotometer (Winooski, VT). The wavelength for excitation was 340 nm, and emission was measured at 510 nm. For intracellular cadmium measurement, cells exposed to cadmium for 1 h were processed as above using the heavy metal-specific fluorescent probe, BTC-5N/AM (1 μm), instead of Fura-2/AM. The BTC-5N fluorescence was measured at a wavelength of 415 nm (excitation) and 500 nm (emission). Cadmium-adapted U937 Cells Exhibit Resistance to Apoptosis Induced by Cadmium—To study cellular adaptive responses to long term cadmium exposure, these metal-adapted U937 cells were established by exposing the cells to stepwise increased cadmium concentrations ranging from 5 to 50 μm. Cadmium resistance of the adapted cell line was tested by MTT assay (Fig. 1A). Upon treatment of cells with 20 and 50 μm CdCl2, the nonadapted parental U937 cells showed 54 and 82% cytotoxicity after 24 h of exposure, respectively. In contrast, the cadmium-adapted cells showed only 5 and 14% cytotoxicity. Resistance to cadmium was also observed with longer treatment (48 h) in the adapted cells. Flow cytometric analysis using annexin V/FITC and PI double staining revealed that after 6 h of treatment with 50 μm CdCl2, early apoptotic parental U937 cells (annexin V-positive, PI-negative) increased to 24.8%; as treatment time extended, the early apoptotic cells gradually decreased, whereas the cells in later stages of apoptosis (annexin V-positive and PI-positive) occupied the majority. Previous work by Li et al. (19Li M. Kondo T. Zhao Q.L. Li F.J. Tanabe K. Arai Y. Zhou Z.C. Kasuya M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 39702-39709Google Scholar) has indicated that these double-positive U937 cells represent secondary necrotic cells whose membranes were damaged by cadmium. In cadmium-adapted cells, no significant time-dependent changes in apoptotic and secondary necrotic cell populations were observed, indicating that the adapted cells were resistant to cadmium-induced apoptosis and subsequent to the plasma membrane damage (Fig. 1B, left panel). Flow cytometric profiles of the parental and cadmium-adapted cells that were left untreated and treated with 50 μm CdCl2 for 24 h are presented in the right panel of Fig. 1B. Caspase-3 and caspase-8 are suggested to be involved in cadmium-induced apoptosis of U937 cells (19Li M. Kondo T. Zhao Q.L. Li F.J. Tanabe K. Arai Y. Zhou Z.C. Kasuya M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 39702-39709Google Scholar). We examined whether both caspases can be cleaved by cadmium treatment. Western blot analysis showed that in parental U937 cells, after 24 h of exposure to 50 μm CdCl2, a significant decrease in both levels of procaspase-3 and -8 was observed. Although the cleaved product of caspase-3 (17 kDa) was visible at 6 h in parental cells, longer exposure of cadmium did not cause the increase of the band intensity. Rather, it became undetectable after 24 h of treatment, reflecting degradation of the cleaved form due to secondary necrotic death. In contrast, cadmium-adapted cells showed no apparent decrease in procaspase-3 and -8 levels after 24 h of exposure to cadmium, further confirming the apoptotic resistance of cadmium-adapted U937 cells (Fig. 1C). Proteome Analysis Associated with Cellular Cadmium Adaptation—To identify proteins associated with cadmium adaptation, protein expression patterns were compared in parental and cadmium-adapted cells by using two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. To ensure that proteins expressed differentially in the adapted cells resulted from the response to cadmium, two-dimensional protein profiles were also compared with that of parental cells treated with 20 μm CdCl2 for 24 h. Fig. 2A shows the Coomassie Blue-stained two-dimensional protein pattern obtained after separation of 2-mg protein samples from the parental U937 cells. About 700 protein spots ranging from 10 to 100 kDa with pI values between 4 and 7 were detected. Fig. 2B is a comparative close-up view of six regions shown in Fig. 2A, where significant differences in protein expression level are marked. These protein spots were excised and subjected to trypsin digestion, MALDI-TOF mass spectra measurements, and data base searching with MS-Fit. Table I summarizes the identified proteins with quantitative alterations in cadmium-adapted cells and cadmium-treated parental cells, compared with untreated parental cells. The proteins commonly up-regulated in the adapted cells as well as cadmium-treated parental cells include retinaldehyde dehydrogenase 2, Rho GDP dissociation inhibitor-α (RhoGDI-α), Ran-binding protein 1 (RanBP1), glutathione S-transferase, heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein C1/C2, c-Myc-binding protein MM1, and a hypothetical protein. Monocyte/neutrophil elastase inhibitor (MNEI) was identified as a down-regulated protein in both cadmium-adapted and cadmium-treated parental cells. Most interesting, protein levels of calbindin-D28k and metastatic tumor antigen-1 short form (MTA-1s) were increased only in cadmium-adapted cells and not in cadmium-treated parental U937 cells.Table IList of identified proteinsSpot no.Protein nameNCBI accession no.MasspICoverageChanges in spot densityaSigns represent relative increase (+) and decrease (-) in the protein level of cadmium-adapted U937 cells (Adapted) and the parental cells treated with 20 μm CdCl2 (Treated) as compared with the untreated parental U937 cells.AdaptedTreatedkDa%1hnRNP C1/C2475854431.965.122++2hnRNP C1/C21309727932.334.916++3Ran-binding protein 193802623.235.231++4Glutathione S-transferase220420723.385.445++5Rho-GDI-α475776823.25.029++6Calbindin-D28K482665530.024.719+-7Transmembrane protein 4765717620.654.857++8Retinaldehyde dehydrogenase 2257772653.065.831++9Monocyte/neutrophil elastase inhibitor1348908742.745.932--10Metastatic tumor antigen 1 (short form)2255029849.015.415+-11c-Myc-binding protein MM1173180918.645.640++12Unnamed protein product1043801024.166.832++a Signs represent relative increase (+) and decrease (-) in the protein level of cadmium-adapted U937 cells (Adapted) and the parental cells treated with 20 μm CdCl2 (Treated) as compared with the untreated parental U937 cells. Open table in a new tab Increased Expression of Calbindin-D28k Resulted from Long Term Adaptation of Cells to Cadmium—In the protein profiling data, the levels of calbindin-D28k and MTA-1s were increased only in cells adapted to prolonged cadmium exposure, suggesting that their up-regulation may be the secondary consequence of cellular response to cadmium. We are particularly interested in calbindin-D28k expression because it is a calcium-binding protein belonging to the calmodulin superfamily with six EF hands (20Kawasaki H. Nakayama S. Kretsinger R.H. Biometals. 1998; 11: 277-295Google Scholar). In many cell types, including U937 cells, cadmium exposure induced intracellular calcium increase, which is in part responsible for mediating the cadmium-induced apoptotic cell death (19Li M. Kondo T. Zhao Q.L. Li F.J. Tanabe K. Arai Y. Zhou Z.C. Kasuya M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 39702-39709Google Scholar). In addition, calbindin-D28k suppressed apoptosis induced by a variety of agents, and the death inhibitory action of calbindin-D28k has been attributed to its ability to remove toxic calcium in cells (12Dowd D.R. MacDonald P.N. Komm B.S. Haussler M.R. Miesfeld R.L. Mol. Endocrinol. 1992; 6: 1843-1848Google Scholar, 13McMahon A. Wong B.S. Iacopino A.M. Ng M.C. Chi S. German D.C. Brain Res. Mol.

Endocrinology. 2001; 142: 3649-3655Google Scholar). Thus, we predicted that calbindin-D28k up-regulation of the adapted U937 cells is a part of the cellular responses to resist cadmium-evoked apoptosis. As a confirmatory experiment, we performed immunoblot analysis by using an anti-calbindin-D28k Ab. The result showed that although the expression level of calbindin-D28k was increased in cadmium-adapted cells, there was no change in calbindin-D28k expression after 24 h of treatment of parental cells with 20 μm CdCl2, which is consistent with the result obtained from the proteome analysis (Fig. 3A). The elevated calbindin-D28k expression was stably maintained even after culturing the cells in cadmium-free medium for at least 15 days (Fig. 3B). The increased expression of calbindin-D28k was also observed in independently established cadmium-adapted U937 cell lines, showing that cells adapted to higher concentrations of cadmium expressed higher levels of calbindin-D28k (Fig. 3C). Thus, during the cadmium adaptation process, cells appear to counteract the toxic effects of this metal by increasing the level of calbindin-D28k. Cadmium-adapted U937 Cells Exhibit Better Calcium Buffering Capacity and Resistance to Death Induced by Intracellular Calcium Overloading—In view of the calcium buffering function of calbindin-D28k, it is likely that the elevation of this protein in the adapted cells may play a role in reducing the level of intracellular toxic calcium ion increased by cadmium. Therefore, we compared the changes in intracellular Ca2+ concentration of cadmium-adapted and parental U937cells by using the cytosolic calcium indicator Fura-2/AM after exposure to cadmium. Fig. 4A shows the time-dependent changes of fluorescence of Fura-2 in cells treated with 20 and 50 μm CdCl2, revealing that the magnitude of increase in the intracellular ion concentrations induced by cadmium was significantly attenuated in cadmium-adapted cells. We also examined the effect of BAPTA-AM, a commonly used chelator of intracellular free Ca2+, on cadmium-induced apoptosis. Fig. 4B illustrates that parental cells pretreated with 20 μm BAPTA-AM and subsequently stimulated with 50 μm CdCl2 for 24 h showed total inhibition of apoptosis, reducing the percentage of apoptotic cells (annexin V-positive) from 53.6 to 18.4%, which was almost equivalent to the percentage value of cadmium-unexposed control cells. As expected, the cadmium-adapted cells were resistant to apoptosis after treatment with 50 μm CdCl2, and pretreatment of BAPTA-AM had no significant effect, suggesting that in the adapted cells the availability of free calcium ions necessary for cadmium-induced apoptosis is greatly reduced by the binding of calcium to the overexpressed calbindin-D28k. To acquire further evidence for the enhanced calcium buffering property of the adapted U937 cells, we tested whether they were better protected from toxicity triggered by intracellular calcium overloading than nonadapted cells. Administration of thapsigargin (the endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase inhibitor) led to a massive increase in cytosolic Ca2+ by efflux from vesicles in the endoplasmic reticulum (26Thastrup O. Cullen P.J. Drobak B.K. Hanley M.R. Dawson A.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 2466-2470Google Scholar). Calcium ionophore (ionomycin) also caused an intracellular Ca2+ rise that was caused by the release of cytosolic Ca2+ stores and Ca2+ influx. These treatments ultimately resulted in cell death in several cell types including U937 cells (27Hampton M.B. Vanags D.M. Porn-Ares M.I. Orrenius S. FEBS Lett. 1996; 399: 277-282Google Scholar, 28Oliverio S. Amendola A. Rodolfo C. Spinedi A. Piacentini M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 34123-34128Google Scholar). MTT assays revealed that after 48 h of treatment with 10–100 nm thapsigargin, the nonadapted U937 cells resulted in 36–45% cytotoxicity, whereas the cadmium-adapted cells showed 13–24% cytotoxicity. The difference in the susceptibilities of these two cell lines was more conspicuous in response to ionomycin, in which addition of this reagent up to 1000 ng/ml was not toxic to the cadmium-adapted cells, rather promoting growth during the 48 h of exposure. However, the nonadapted parental cells exhibited ∼40% cytotoxicity with 500–1000 ng/ml ionomycin (Fig. 4C). Taken together, our results indicate that cadmium-adapted cells are less sensitive to"
https://openalex.org/W1972522134,"In human cells, large DNA loop heterologies are repaired through a nick-directed pathway independent of mismatch repair. However, a 3′-nick generated by bacteriophage fd gene II protein heterology is not capable of stimulating loop repair. To evaluate the possibility that a mismatch near a loop could induce both repair types in human cell extracts, we constructed and tested a set of DNA heteroduplexes, each of which contains a combination of mismatches and loops. We have demonstrated that a strand break generated by restriction endonucleases 3′ to a large loop is capable of provoking and directing loop repair. The repair of 3′-heteroduplexes in human cell extracts is very similar to that of 5′-heteroduplex repair, being strand-specific and highly biased to the nicked strand. This observation suggests that the loop repair pathway possesses bidirectional repair capability similar to that of the bacterial loop repair system. We also found that a nick 5′ to a coincident mismatch and loop can apparently stimulate the repair of both. In contrast, 3′-nick-directed repair of a G-G mismatch was reduced when in the vicinity of a loop (33 or 46 bp between two sites). Increasing the distance separating the G-G mismatch and loop by 325 bp restored the efficiency of repair to the level of a single base-base mismatch. This observation suggests interference between 3′-nick-directed large loop repair and conventional mismatch repair systems when a mispair is near a loop. We propose a model in which DNA repair systems avoid simultaneous repair at adjacent sites to avoid the creation of double-stranded DNA breaks.

Conflicting results have been obtained regarding the strand specificity and the role of strand breaks in mammalian loop repair. Although single-stranded loops of varying sizes are repaired efficiently in vivo, there is a 2:1 bias against loop retention (20Weiss U. Wilson J.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 1619-1623Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Nicks have a minor effect on strand discrimination for biased repair of 25–57-base single-stranded loops in monkey cells (21Weiss U. Wilson J.H. Somatic Cell Mol. Genet. 1989; 15: 13-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). However, in vitro functional assays have been used to demonstrate that, in the absence of nicks, repair of multi-based loops is inefficient. Umar et al. (14Umar A. Boyer J.C. Kunkel T.A. Science. 1994; 266: 814-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar) and Littman et al. (16Littman S.J. Fang W.-h. Modrich P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7474-7481Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) have identified a vigorous 5′-nick-directed loop repair activity of this type using mismatch repair-deficient extracts and DNA substrates containing 5–16 (14Umar A. Boyer J.C. Kunkel T.A. Science. 1994; 266: 814-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar) or ≥27 (16Littman S.J. Fang W.-h. Modrich P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7474-7481Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) nucleotides in the loop. Although Umar et al. (14Umar A. Boyer J.C. Kunkel T.A. Science. 1994; 266: 814-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar) found that a 3′-nick can direct repair of 2–5-nucleotide loops, they could not rule out that at least some of this activity could be attributed to the mismatch repair system. In contrast, the latter study observed no significant repair of this type for 27- or 216-nucleotide loops (16Littman S.J. Fang W.-h. Modrich P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7474-7481Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Recently, McCulloch et al. (22McCulloch S.D. Gu L. Li G.-M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 3891-3896Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) demonstrated that heteroduplexes containing 2–12-nucleotide loops can be processed bidirectionally by mismatch repair-dependent and -independent pathways in human cells. A study of the repair mechanism revealed that the processing of the heterology in substrates with a 3′-strand break is consistent with the involvement of endonucleases as yet unidentified (22McCulloch S.D. Gu L. Li G.-M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 3891-3896Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). McCulloch et al. (23McCulloch S.D. Gu L. Li G.-M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 50803-50809Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) also found that large loops can be processed through both a nick-directed and loop-directed process.Recent studies of E. coli loop repair in our laboratory showed that a strand break located either 3′ or 5′ to the loop is sufficient to direct heterology-dependent repair to nicked strands in mismatch repair-deficient cell extracts (19Fang W.-h. Wang B.-J. Wang C.-H. Lee S.-J. Chang Y.-T. Chuang Y.-K. Lee C.-N. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 22446-22452Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Consequently, it appears that bacterial nick-directed loop repair has a broader substrate specificity than that observed in the human pathway (16Littman S.J. Fang W.-h. Modrich P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7474-7481Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). However, the design of 3′-nicked substrates in our study is different from previous eukaryotic loop repair experiments (19Fang W.-h. Wang B.-J. Wang C.-H. Lee S.-J. Chang Y.-T. Chuang Y.-K. Lee C.-N. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 22446-22452Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Thus, a potential activating role of 3′-strand break in human loop repair still needs to be clarified.Although transformation experiments with E. coli suggest that loops can be indirectly co-repaired by the dam-directed mismatch repair system (24Carraway M. Marinus M.G. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 3972-3980Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), analogous experiments in human cells have not been reported. Taghian et al. (25Taghian D.G. Hough H. Nickoloff J.A. Genetics. 1998; 148: 1257-1268Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) did, however, evaluate an in vivo extrachromosomal recombination assay in Chinese hamster ovary cells. They identified a loop repair activity that processes predicted loop heterologies consistent with the single-strand annealing model of recombination intermediates. Moreover, this in vivo loop repair activity is independent of the general (enzyme complexes of MutS homologs/enzyme complexes of MutL homologs) mismatch repair (25Taghian D.G. Hough H. Nickoloff J.A. Genetics. 1998; 148: 1257-1268Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 26Bill C.A. Taghian D.G. Duran W.A. Nickoloff J.A. Mutat. Res. 2001; 485: 255-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). However, in the presence of single-base mismatches, the loop repair is inhibited (25Taghian D.G. Hough H. Nickoloff J.A. Genetics. 1998; 148: 1257-1268Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, in mismatch repair-deficient cells, single-base mismatches are repaired more efficiently in the presence of a loop, consistent with a co-repair initiated at the loop (25Taghian D.G. Hough H. Nickoloff J.A. Genetics. 1998; 148: 1257-1268Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).We therefore constructed a set of heteroduplexes containing a combination of loops and mispairs to study human large loop repair and its interaction with mismatch repair pathways. We have demonstrated here that nuclear extracts derived from HeLa cell lines support efficient 3′-nick-directed large loop repair in vitro. We also found a negative interference between 3′-nick-directed large loop repair and conventional mismatch repair systems when a mispair is in the vicinity of a loop. This may have broad implications for heterologous DNA repair systems functioning in close proximity to one another.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—E. coli strains NM522 and RS5033, bacteriophage f1MR1, and the nucleotide numbering at restriction endonuclease cleavage sites have been described (11Fang W.-h.

Chem. 1988; 263: 6829-6835Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). HeLa S3 and LoVo cells were grown at 37 °C in 5% CO2 atmosphere as described (16Littman S.J. Fang W.-h. Modrich P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7474-7481Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Nuclear extracts were prepared as described (28Holmes Jr., J. Clark S. Modrich P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 5837-5841Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar). ATP-dependent DNase, E. coli DNA ligase, T4 polynucleotide kinase, calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase, and restriction endonucleases were obtained from commercial sources.Construction of f1PM Mutants—A 200-bp HindIII-NheI fragment (coordinates 29–229) from pBR322 was inserted into f1MR1 at the NheI and HindIII cleavage sites (coordinate 5621 and 5627 of f1MR1). Subsequently, a 24-bp fragment from phage M13mp18 XbaI and HindIII digestion was inserted into f1MR1 at the HindIII and XbaI cleavage sites (coordinate 5821 and 5832 of f1MR1). The phage in this construction, which retains the HindIII site, is designated f1PM. The phage was further mutagenized by insertion of a synthetic 21-bp oligonucleotide linker into the HindIII cleavage site, a 24-bp oligonucleotide linker into the NheI cleavage site, or a synthetic 32-bp linker into the XbaI cleavage site (see Fig. 1 and Table I). As shown in Table I, a randomized site was used in each oligonucleotide linker so that all four nucleotide permutations could be obtained from each insertion. Each of the variants contained a new unique restriction endonuclease recognition sequence (see Table I). Phages f1hG-N and f1hC-N-xG were constructed by insertion of a 292-bp NspI restriction fragment derived from plasmid pBR322 (coordinates 1816–2108) into SphI-cleaved f1hG and f1hCxG, respectively. Mutant f1PM phages were identified by restriction analysis of replicative form minipreparations, and mutant sequences were confirmed by DNA sequencing.Table IConstruction of f1PM derivatives for heteroduplex preparationAt the HindIII site,V5′-AGCTACGGTCCNTAAGGTGGTCTGCCAGGNATTCCACCATCGA-5′At the NheI site,V5′-CTAGTCGGCCNACGTGAGGATGGACAGCCGGNTGCACTCCTACCTGATC-5′And at the XbaI siteV5′-CTAGTGTCTTGATGCCTGTCCGGNACCTCCTA-3′CACAGAACTACGGACAGGCCNTGGAGGATGATC-5′f1 mutantInsertion site and substitution at position NHindIIIMarkerXbaIMarkerNheIMarkerf1hAAPf1MIf1hCCBsu36If1hGGCpoIf1hTTAf1IIf1xGGPpuMIf1hAxGAPf1MIGPpuMIf1hCxGCBsu36IGPpuMIf1hGxGGCpoIGPpuMIf1hTxGTAf1IIGPpuMIf1hGxCGCpoICBglIf1nGhCxCCBsu36ICBglIGEagIf1hG-NGCpoIf1hC-N-xGCBsu36IGPpuMI Open table in a new tab Construction of Heteroduplex DNA—Heteroduplex DNA substrates were constructed essentially as described by Lu et al. (29Lu A.L. Clark S. Modrich P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 4639-4643Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). Phage f1PM derivative replicative form DNA (1 mg) was linearized with AlwNI, BanII, or EcoRV and mixed with a 4-fold molar excess of viral DNA, followed by alkaline denaturation and annealing. After isolation by hydroxylapatite chromatography, double-stranded DNA was dialyzed, and linear homoduplex DNA was removed by digestion with ATP-dependent DNase (28Holmes Jr., J. Clark S. Modrich P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 5837-5841Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar). The open circular heteroduplex was purified by Sephadex G-200 chromatography (Amersham Biosciences) and benzoylated naphthylated DEAE-cellulose chromatography (Sigma) as described previously (30Kat A. Thilly W.G. Fang W.-h. Longley M.J. Li G.-M. Modrich P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 6424-6428Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar). The covalently closed circular substrates were prepared by E. coli DNA ligase treatment of nicked substrates in the presence of ethidium bromide (96 mmol of dye/mol of nucleotide) and then isolated by equilibrium centrifugation in CsCl/ethidium bromide (29Lu A.L. Clark S. Modrich P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 4639-4643Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). Substrates containing a nick at the replication origin of the viral strand were prepared by cleaving covalently closed circular heteroduplexes with bacteriophage fd gene II protein (gpII) 1The abbreviation used is: gpII, gene II protein. as described (31Fang W.-h. Modrich P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11838-11844Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).The substrates used in this study are summarized in Table II. By pairing different f1PM derivatives, a heteroduplex containing a combination of base-base mismatches and/or a loop can be constructed. The location of the strand break can be determined by the restriction endonuclease employed to cleave the replicative form DNA used in the construction (i.e. the following sites at the following locations: AlwNI, position 2192; EcoRV, position 5667; and BanII, position 5887). Strand breaks were placed in complementary strands either 3′ or 5′ to the mismatch (see Fig. 1).Table IIHeteroduplex substratesTypeHeteroduplexV strandC strand1AT-Gf1hTf1hC1AT-Tf1hTf1hA1AA-Gf1hAf1hC1AA-Af1hAf1hT1AG-Af1hGf1hT1AG-Gf1hGf1hC1AA-Cf1hAf1hG1AC-Cf1hCf1hG1BxC32f1PMf1xG1BxV32f1xGf1PM1CTGxC32f1hTf1hCxG1CTGxC32f1hTf1hCxG1CTTxC32f1hCf1hAxG1CCTxC32f1hCf1hAxG1CAAxC32f1hGf1hTxG1CGAxC32f1hGf1hTxG1CGGxC32f1hAf1hGxG1CACxC32f1hAf1hGxG1CCCxC32f1hCf1hGxG1DGGxV32f1hGxGf1hC1EhC21xGGf1xGf1hGxC1FhGG-N-xC32f1hG-Nf1hC-N-xG1GnC24-3′-GG′f1nGhCxCf1hGxC Open table in a new tab Mismatch Repair and Endonuclease Assays—Loop repair in human nuclear extracts was determined in a manner similar to that described for human mismatch repair (28Holmes Jr., J. Clark S. Modrich P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 5837-5841Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar). The repair reaction using concentrated nuclear extracts was carried out in 40 μl containing 0.02 m Tris-HCl (pH 7.6), 5 mm MgCl2, 0.11 m KCl (derived by titrating extracts with KCl to determine the optimal concentration), 50 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 1 mm ATP, 0.1 mm dATP, 0.1 mm dGTP, 0.1 mm dTTP, 0.1 mm dCTP, and 0.4 μg (92 fmol) of heteroduplex DNA. The addition of cell-free human nuclear extracts was optimized to 7.5 mg/ml protein. Incubation was at 37 °C for 15 min. The reactions were quenched by the addition of 40 μl of 40 mm EDTA (pH 8.0) and 1% SDS, followed by incubation with proteinase K at 37 °C for 30 min. The DNA was then purified by phenol extraction and ethanol precipitation, divided into four aliquots, and analyzed by restriction endonuclease digestion and agarose gel electrophoresis. The ethidium complexes of DNA products were quantified using a gel documentation CCD camera (UVP Inc.) (11Fang W.-h. Wu J.-Y. Su M.-J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22714-22720Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar).RESULTSSubstrate Specificity of Mismatch Repair in HeLa Cell Nuclear Extracts—Using circular f1MR heteroduplex substrates, previous studies have shown that nuclear extracts of HeLa cells can at least repair all eight possible base-base mismatches in a strand-specific manner targeted by a single-strand break located 808 or 125 bp 5′ to the mismatches in the complementary DNA strand (28Holmes Jr., J. Clark S. Modrich P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 5837-5841Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar, 30Kat A. Thilly W.G. Fang W.-h. Longley M.J. Li G.-M. Modrich P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 6424-6428Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar). Due to the limitation of unique restriction endonuclease sites in the f1MR DNA, it is not possible to place a strand break 3′ to the mismatch in the complementary strand. A covalently closed circular heteroduplex treated with gpII protein and MutH can generate strand breaks 181 and 1024 bp 3′ to the mismatch in the viral strand (31Fang W.-h. Modrich P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11838-11844Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, these substrates are difficult to make, and the product yield is very low; thus, only G-T heteroduplexes were made and tested (31Fang W.-h. Modrich P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11838-11844Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We therefore designed a new set of circular heteroduplex molecules in which strand breaks 3′ to the mismatch can be conveniently placed in the complementary strand.Starting from phage f1MR1 (27Su S.S. Lahue R.S. Au K.G. Modrich P. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 6829-6835Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we prepared a set of four f1h derivatives that contain single-base differences (Fig. 1 and Table I). This set of f1h derivatives permits construction of heteroduplexes representing all eight possible base pair mismatches. In each of these heteroduplexes, the heterology is located at the same position (coordinate 5833). Moreover, as shown in Table II, each mismatch is located within overlapping restriction endonuclease recognition sites; and in every case, the rest of the sequences are identical. The generation of overlapping restriction sites was accomplished while maintaining the overall sequence environment by perfect alignment of four restriction endonuclease recognition sequences with only a single-base difference. This set of heteroduplexes allows correction on either DNA strand to be directly determined under conditions in which the effects of sequence environment on repair efficiency are minimized. Digestion of the heteroduplex DNA with AlwNI (Fig. 1) and the indicator restriction endonuclease, whose recognition site was inactive because of the heterology, yielded a 6.6-kb fragment only (Fig. 2A). Similar digestion of DNA in which the recognition sequence had been restored by repair reaction yielded 3.0- and 3.6-kb fragments (Fig. 2C).Fig. 2Repair of heteroduplexes containing both mismatches and loops in HeLa nuclear extracts. Repair reactions with HeLa nuclear extracts were performed as described under “Experimental Procedures.” DNA products were digested with AlwNI (Fig. 1) and the appropriate restriction endonuclease (Tables I and II) and were then subjected to agarose gel electrophoresis to score mismatch repair occurring on each DNA strand.

As judged by repair levels, all 5′-substrates were effectively repaired, with efficiency comparable with that observed in previous studies (30Kat A. Thilly W.G. Fang W.-h. Longley M.J. Li G.-M. Modrich P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 6424-6428Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar). All the 3′-heteroduplexes were also effectively repaired with efficiency similar to the repair of 5′-substrates (Table III). It is evident that the repair specificity is dependent on the mismatch recognition and fails to distinguish the polarity of the strand break.Table IIIEfficiency of mismatch repair in HeLa nuclear extractsHeteroduplexRepair3′-Substrate5′-SubstrateococfmolT-G11.4 ± 0.92.8 ± 1.612.0 ± 2.02.3 ± 0.3T-T12.9 ± 0.32.1 ± 1.112.0 ± 2.22.4 ± 0.8C-T13.2 ± 1.52.2 ± 1.913.8 ± 0.81.8 ± 1.7A-A12.4 ± 0.62.1 ± 1.311.9 ± 1.91.8 ± 1.3G-A13.0 ± 1.11.9 ± 0.612.2 ± 1.21.7 ± 1.0G-G12.7 ± 1.73.9 ± 0.612.1 ± 2.22.8 ± 1.3A-C12.3 ± 1.01.6 ± 1.111.9 ± 0.72.2 ± 0.3C-C8.3 ± 3.21.9 ± 0.26.7 ± 3.81.2 ± 1.1 Open table in a new tab Strand-specific Loop Repair Directed by a Nick 3′ to the Heterologies—A previous study has shown that mismatch-independent repair of a DNA loop that is 27 nucleotides in length or larger in human cells can be directed only by a 5′-nick, but not a 3′-nick (16Littman S.J. Fang W.-h. Modrich P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7474-7481Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). To further characterize this observation, we prepared f1PM-based looped substrates containing a nick generated by restriction endonucleases in the complementary strand 3′ to a 32-nucleotide loop (Fig. 1B and Table II, xC32 and xV32). In contrast to the previous results, the looped heteroduplexes with 3′-nicks were effectively processed by human cell extracts. As shown in Fig. 2D and Table IV, our results suggest that 3′-nicks can efficiently direct loop repair in a strand-specific way. The repair levels were comparable with corresponding 5′-heteroduplexes in Table IV and previously reported 5′-heteroduplexes (16Littman S.J. Fang W.-h. Modrich P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7474-7481Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Repair of these DNAs displayed a substantial bias (2.5–10-fold) toward the nicked DNA strand.Table IVEfficiency of 3′- and 5′-nick-directed loop repair in HeLa nuclear extractsHeteroduplexRepair3′-Substrate5′-Substrateococfmolf1PMxC325.9 ± 0.90.5 ± 0.54.7 ± 0.51.5 ± 0.4xV327.2 ± 0.32.4 ± 0.3hC214.7 ± 0.22.0 ± 0.5M13 mp18C168.8 ± 0.30.9 ± 0.24.5 ± 0.30.4 ± 0.4V223.8 ± 0.31.7 ± 0.026.3 ± 0.10.8 ± 0.2C278.6 ± 0.51.6 ± 0.093.8 ± 0.61.7 ± 0.7V453.0 ± 0.30.8 ± 0.114.8 ± 0.40.9 ± 0.3V4293.2 ± 0.12.5 ± 0.35.1 ± 0.30.5 ± 0.2 Open table in a new tab To ascertain that 3′-nick-directed loop repair is a general pathway, we tested a subset of looped M13LR heteroduplex substrates (19Fang W.-h.

The results obtained with M13LR heteroduplexes further confirmed that human cell extracts can process 3′-nicked loops (Table IV). All of the M13LR 3′-heteroduplexes containing loops of 16–45 nucleotides were processed with levels and strand bias similar to those of f1PM substrates. Significant repair was also observed for the 3′-heteroduplexes containing a 429-nucleotide unpaired region, but this substrate was processed with less strand bias than those containing the smaller non-homologous segment. We attribute the higher loop removal activity in the continuous viral strand of V429 as the loop-directed reaction described by McCulloch et al. (23McCulloch S.D. Gu L. Li G.-M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 50803-50809Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar).Whereas all of the 3′-heteroduplexes generated by restriction endonuclease digestion contained the strand break in the complementary strand, tested substrates included several with the loop present in either the complementary or viral strand (Table IV). Consequently, the strand-specific asymmetry observed for repair of 3′-heteroduplexes cannot be attributed to the presence of a simple loop in a particular strand. Rather, this effect must be due to the 3′-strand break. Furthermore, the sequence contents in the region of heterologies and the nicks are very different between the f1PM and M13LR (19Fang W.-h.

It therefore seems highly unlikely that the repair events are a consequence of nonspecific activities.In previous studies, heteroduplexes with a 3′-nick were generated by gpII incision in the viral strand (16Littman S.J.
