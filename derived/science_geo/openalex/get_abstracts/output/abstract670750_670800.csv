https://openalex.org/W3138214368,"The characteristics and evolution of pulmonary fibrosis in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) have not been adequately studied. AI-assisted chest high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) was used to investigate the proportion of COVID-19 patients with pulmonary fibrosis, the relationship between the degree of fibrosis and the clinical classification of COVID-19, the characteristics of and risk factors for pulmonary fibrosis, and the evolution of pulmonary fibrosis after discharge. The incidence of pulmonary fibrosis in patients with severe or critical COVID-19 was significantly higher than that in patients with moderate COVID-19. There were significant differences in the degree of pulmonary inflammation and the extent of the affected area among patients with mild, moderate and severe pulmonary fibrosis. The IL-6 level in the acute stage and albumin level were independent risk factors for pulmonary fibrosis. Ground-glass opacities, linear opacities, interlobular septal thickening, reticulation, honeycombing, bronchiectasis and the extent of the affected area were significantly improved 30, 60 and 90 days after discharge compared with at discharge. The more severe the clinical classification of COVID-19, the more severe the residual pulmonary fibrosis was; however, in most patients, pulmonary fibrosis was improved or even resolved within 90 days after discharge."
https://openalex.org/W3137588420,"Exciting therapeutic targets are emerging from CRISPR-based screens of high mutational-burden adult cancers. A key question, however, is whether functional genomic approaches will yield new targets in pediatric cancers, known for remarkably few mutations, which often encode proteins considered challenging drug targets. To address this, we created a first-generation pediatric cancer dependency map representing 13 pediatric solid and brain tumor types. Eighty-two pediatric cancer cell lines were subjected to genome-scale CRISPR–Cas9 loss-of-function screening to identify genes required for cell survival. In contrast to the finding that pediatric cancers harbor fewer somatic mutations, we found a similar complexity of genetic dependencies in pediatric cancer cell lines compared to that in adult models. Findings from the pediatric cancer dependency map provide preclinical support for ongoing precision medicine clinical trials. The vulnerabilities observed in pediatric cancers were often distinct from those in adult cancer, indicating that repurposing adult oncology drugs will be insufficient to address childhood cancers. A pediatric cancer dependency map generated with genome-scale CRISPR–Cas9 loss-of-function screens in 82 pediatric cancer cell lines highlights genetic dependencies across a range of tumor types."
https://openalex.org/W3136984727,"Cyclin-dependent kinase 12 (CDK12) is an emerging therapeutic target due to its role in regulating transcription of DNA-damage response (DDR) genes. However, development of selective small molecules targeting CDK12 has been challenging due to the high degree of homology between kinase domains of CDK12 and other transcriptional CDKs, most notably CDK13. In the present study, we report the rational design and characterization of a CDK12-specific degrader, BSJ-4-116. BSJ-4-116 selectively degraded CDK12 as assessed through quantitative proteomics. Selective degradation of CDK12 resulted in premature cleavage and poly(adenylation) of DDR genes. Moreover, BSJ-4-116 exhibited potent antiproliferative effects, alone and in combination with the poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitor olaparib, as well as when used as a single agent against cell lines resistant to covalent CDK12 inhibitors. Two point mutations in CDK12 were identified that confer resistance to BSJ-4-116, demonstrating a potential mechanism that tumor cells can use to evade bivalent degrader molecules."
https://openalex.org/W3136745559,"The hippocampus contains neural representations capable of supporting declarative memory. Hippocampal place cells are one such representation, firing in one or few locations in a given environment. Between environments, place cell firing fields remap (turning on/off or moving to a new location) to provide a population-wide code for distinct contexts. However, the manner by which contextual features combine to drive hippocampal remapping remains a matter of debate. Using large-scale in vivo two-photon intracellular calcium recordings in mice during virtual navigation, we show that remapping in the hippocampal region CA1 is driven by prior experience regarding the frequency of certain contexts and that remapping approximates an optimal estimate of the identity of the current context. A simple associative-learning mechanism reproduces these results. Together, our findings demonstrate that place cell remapping allows an animal to simultaneously identify its physical location and optimally estimate the identity of the environment."
https://openalex.org/W3138433830,"Studying cellular and developmental processes in complex multicellular organisms can require the non-destructive observation of thousands to billions of cells deep within an animal. DNA recorders address the staggering difficulty of this task by converting transient cellular experiences into mutations at defined genomic sites that can be sequenced later in high throughput. However, existing recorders act primarily by erasing DNA. This is problematic because, in the limit of progressive erasure, no record remains. We present a DNA recorder called CHYRON (Cell History Recording by Ordered Insertion) that acts primarily by writing new DNA through the repeated insertion of random nucleotides at a single locus in temporal order. To achieve in vivo DNA writing, CHYRON combines Cas9, a homing guide RNA and the template-independent DNA polymerase terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase. We successfully applied CHYRON as an evolving lineage tracer and as a recorder of user-selected cellular stimuli. CHYRON (Cell History Recording by Ordered Insertion) enables DNA recording of cellular states and lineage reconstruction by Cas9-targeted insertions of random nucleotides by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase."
https://openalex.org/W3137357059,"Since its emergence in China, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has spread worldwide including Pakistan. During the pandemic, whole genome sequencing has played an important role in understanding the evolution and genomic diversity of SARS-CoV-2. Although an unprecedented number of SARS-CoV-2 full genomes have been submitted in GISAID and NCBI, data from Pakistan is scarce. We report the sequencing, genomic characterization, and phylogenetic analysis of five SARS-CoV-2 strains isolated from patients in Pakistan. The oropharyngeal swabs of patients that were confirmed positive for SARS-CoV-2 through real-time RT-PCR at National Institute of Health, Pakistan, were selected for whole-genome sequencing. Sequencing was performed using NEBNext Ultra II Directional RNA Library Prep kit for Illumina (NEW ENGLAND BioLabs Inc., MA, US) and Illumina iSeq 100 instrument (Illumina, San Diego, US). Based on whole-genome analysis, three Pakistani SARS-CoV-2 strains clustered into the 20A (GH) clade along with the strains from Oman, Slovakia, United States, and Pakistani strain EPI_ISL_513925. The two 19B (S)-clade strains were closely related to viruses from India and Oman. Overall, twenty-nine amino acid mutations were detected in the current study genome sequences, including fifteen missense and four novel mutations. Notably, we have found a D614G (aspartic acid to glycine) mutation in spike protein of the sequences from the GH clade. The G614 variant carrying the characteristic D614G mutation has been shown to be more infectious that lead to its rapid spread worldwide. This report highlights the detection of GH and S clade strains and G614 variant from Pakistan warranting large-scale whole-genome sequencing of strains prevalent in different regions to understand virus evolution and to explore their genetic diversity."

https://openalex.org/W3138989508,"Prokaryotic communities play key roles in biogeochemical transformation and cycling of nutrients in the productive mangrove ecosystem. In this study, the vertical distribution of rhizosphere bacteria was evaluated by profiling the bacterial diversity and community structure in the rhizospheres of four mangrove species ( Sonneratia alba , Rhizophora mucronata , Ceriops tagal and Avicennia marina ) from Mida Creek and Gazi Bay, Kenya, using DNA-metabarcoding. Alpha diversity was not significantly different between sites, but, significantly higher in the rhizospheres of S . alba and R . mucronata in Gazi Bay than in Mida Creek. Chemical parameters of the mangrove sediments significantly correlated inversely with alpha diversity metrics. The bacterial community structure was significantly differentiated by geographical location, mangrove species and sampling depth, however, differences in mangrove species and sediment chemical parameters explained more the variation in bacterial community structure. Proteobacteria (mainly Deltaproteobacteria and Gammaproteobacteria ) was the dominant phylum while the families Desulfobacteraceae , Pirellulaceae and Syntrophobacteraceae were dominant in both study sites and across all mangrove species. Constrained redundancy analysis indicated that calcium, potassium, magnesium, electrical conductivity, pH, nitrogen, sodium, carbon and salinity contributed significantly to the species–environment relationship. Predicted functional profiling using PICRUSt2 revealed that pathways for sulfur and carbon metabolism were significantly enriched in Gazi Bay than Mida Creek. Overall, the results indicate that bacterial community composition and their potential function are influenced by mangrove species and a fluctuating influx of nutrients in the mangrove ecosystems of Gazi Bay and Mida Creek."
https://openalex.org/W3139349889,"LED technology facilitates a range of spectral quality, which can be used to optimize photosynthesis, plant shape and secondary metabolism. We conducted three studies to investigate the effect of blue photon fraction on yield and quality of medical hemp. Conditions were varied among studies to evaluate potential interactions with environment, but all environmental conditions other than the blue photon fraction were maintained constant among the five-chambers in each study. The photosynthetic photon flux density (PPFD, 400 to 700 nm) was rigorously maintained at the set point among treatments in each study by raising the fixtures. The lowest fraction of blue photons was 4% from HPS, and increased to 9.8, 10.4, 16, and 20% from LEDs. There was a consistent, linear, 12% decrease in yield in each study as the fraction of blue photons increased from 4 to 20%. Dry flower yield ranged from 500 to 750 g m -2 . This resulted in a photon conversion efficacy of 0.22 to 0.36 grams dry flower mass yield per mole of photons. Yield was higher at a PPFD of 900 than at 750 μmol m -2 s -1 . There was no effect of spectral quality on CBD or THC concentration. CBD and THC were 8% and 0.3% at harvest in trials one and two, and 12% and 0.5% in trial three. The CBD/THC ratio was about 25 to 1 in all treatments and studies. The efficacy of the fixtures ranged from 1.7 (HPS) to 2.5 μmol per joule (white+red LED). Yield under the white+red LED fixture (10.4% blue) was 4.6% lower than the HPS on a per unit area basis, but was 27% higher on a per dollar of electricity basis. These findings suggest that fixture efficacy and initial cost of the fixture are more important for return on investment than spectral distribution at high photon flux."

https://openalex.org/W3138464507,"It has been recognized for >50 years that cytochrome b5 (b5) stimulates some cytochrome P450 (P450)–catalyzed oxidations, but the basis of this function is still not understood well. The strongest stimulation of catalytic activity by b5 is in the P450 17A1 lyase reaction, an essential step in androgen synthesis from 21-carbon (C21) steroids, making this an excellent model system to interrogate b5 function. One of the issues in studying b5–P450 interactions has been the limited solution assay methods. We constructed a fluorescently labeled variant of human b5 that can be used in titrations. The labeled b5 bound to WT P450 17A1 with a Kd of 2.5 nM and rapid kinetics, on the order of 1 s−1. Only weak binding was observed with the clinical P450 17A1 variants E305G, R347H, and R358Q; these mutants are deficient in lyase activity, which has been hypothesized to be due to attenuated b5 binding. Kd values were not affected by the presence of P450 17A1 substrates. A peptide containing the P450 17A1 Arg-347/Arg-358 region attenuated Alexa 488-T70C-b5 fluorescence at higher concentrations. The addition of NADPH–P450 reductase (POR) to an Alexa 488-T70C-b5:P450 17A1 complex resulted in a concentration-dependent partial restoration of b5 fluorescence, indicative of a ternary P450:b5:POR complex, which was also supported by gel filtration experiments. Overall, these results are interpreted in the context of a dynamic and tight P450 17A1:b5 complex that also binds POR to form a catalytically competent ternary complex, and variants that disrupt this interaction have low catalytic activity.

Cytochrome P450 (P450, CYP) enzymes are the major catalysts involved in the oxidation of chemicals (1Rendic S. Guengerich F.P.

In addition to playing major roles in areas as diverse as drug metabolism and the biosynthesis of natural products, P450s are the major catalysts involved in steroid metabolism and catalyze most of the oxidations beginning with the side-chain cleavage of cholesterol to form pregnenolone (2Auchus R.J.

P450 17A1 plays a critical role in the synthesis of androgens as well as in the generation of 17α-hydroxy (17α-OH) steroids and in the synthesis of mineralocorticoids and glucocorticoids (Fig. 1).

Fluorescence attenuation assays allowed for analysis with submicromolar concentrations of proteins, with estimates of binding constants and rates of association and dissociation. In contrast to previous proposals about this system, we provide evidence that P450–b5 interactions are not tightly linked to substrate identity and occupancy and that a ternary P450 17A1–b5–NADPH–P450 reductase (POR) complex is preferred to a model in which b5 and POR shuttle at a single site. Plasmids for WT P450 17A1 and five clinically observed variants were constructed in a pCW expression vector and expressed in Escherichia coli JM109 cells (Figs. 2 and S1). WT P450 17A1 showed an expression level of ∼450 nmol per liter culture, and the expression levels of the E305G, R347H, and R358Q variants were 400, 100, and 200 nmol per liter, respectively (Fig. S1). However, no P450 holoenzyme spectra were detected for the R347C and P428L variants (Fig. S1, C and F). Purified WT P450 17A1 and three variant proteins (E305G, R347H, and R358Q) were prepared by Ni2+–nitrilotriacetate (NTA) affinity column chromatography. The spectra of these purified variant proteins showed very little of peaks corresponding to inactive cytochrome P420 (Fig. 2, B–D). All subsequent assays were based on the amount of spectrally detectable P450 heme for WT and variant P450 17A1 enzymes. Steady-state kinetic parameters for all (four) hydroxylation and lyase reactions (Fig. 1) of WT P450 17A1 and the three purified variants (E305G, R347H, and R358Q) were measured. For the 17α-hydroxylation of progesterone, all three variants formed the 17α-OH product, but their activities (specificity constants, kcat/Km) were attenuated to 3 to 11% of that of WT P450 17A1 (Fig. 3A and Table 1). The 17α-OH progesterone lyase activities of the R347H and R358Q variants were reduced more dramatically (to <1%) (Fig. 3B and Table 1). However, the E305G variant differed in that progesterone 17α-hydroxylation activity was decreased (to 8%) more than the lyase reaction activity (28%) (Fig. 3A and Table 1).Table 1Steady-state kinetic parameters for reactions of P450 17A1 variantsP450 17A1 variantProgesterone 17α-hydroxylation17α-OH progesterone conversion to androstenedionekcat, min−1Km, μMkcat/Km% WT (kcat/Km)kcat, min−1Km, μMkcat/Km% WT (kcat/Km)WT6.4 ± 0.57.8 ± 1.40.82 ± 0.161000.29 ± 0.025.5 ± 0.80.052± 0.008100E305G0.19 ± 0.013.1 ± 0.40.06 ± 0.0180.092 ± 0.0306.3 ± 5.10.015 ± 0.01328R347H0.18 ± 0.028.1 ± 2.20.02 ± 0.0140.002 ± 0.0016.1 ± 1.20.0003 ± 0.0020.6R358Q0.43 ± 0.024.6 ± 0.70.09 ± 0.02110.006 ± 0.00215 ± 90.0004 ± 0.00030.8Pregnenolone 17α-hydroxylation17α-OH pregnenolone conversion to DHEAWT0.88 ± 0.050.47 ± 0.201.9 ± 0.81005.5 ± 0.76.7 ± 2.10.83 ± 0.28100E305G0.07 ± 0.025.7 ± 4.60.01 ± 0.010.70.056 ± 0.0109.4 ± 3.70.006 ± 0.0030.7R347H0.53 ± 0.041.5 ± 0.50.35 ± 0.12190.043 ± 0.0064.8 ± 1.70.009 ± 0.0031.1R358Q0.58 ± 0.092.6 ± 1.40.22 ± 0.13120.056 ± 0.01310 ± 50.005 ± 0.0010.6DHEA, dehydroepiandrosterone.

The R347H and R358Q variants showed similar levels of pregnenolone 17α-hydroxylation (slight reduction) but only very low levels of 17α-OH pregnenolone lyase activity (Fig. 3, C and D and Table 1). The E305G variant displayed highly reduced pregnenolone 17α-hydroxylation and 17α-OH pregnenolone lyase activities (Fig. 3, C and D and Table 1). One previous study reported a similar result (42Peng H.M. Im S.C. Pearl N.M. Turcu A.F. Rege J. Waskell L. Auchus R.J.

These results indicated that the 17,20-lyase activity in all three variants was impaired even when excess b5 was present. Substrate binding of purified P450 17A1 (WT and three variants) was analyzed in titrations with all four major substrates. WT P450 17A1 and all variant enzymes showed a typical “type І” substrate-binding spectral titration change (increase at 388 nm, decrease at 423 nm, corresponding to a shift in the iron spin state from low to high (44Schenkman J.B. Remmer H. Estabrook R.W. Spectral studies of drug interaction with hepatic microsomal cytochrome P-450.Mol. Pharmacol. 1967; 3: 113-123PubMed Google Scholar)) (Figs. S2 and S3). The calculated Kd value of WT P450 17A1 with progesterone was ∼0.065 μM, although even with quadratic analysis, there is considerable error in such a low value (Table 2). The Kd values of the three variants were somewhat increased, for example, from 0.17 to 0.26 μM (Table 2). The Kd values of variants for 17α-OH progesterone, pregnenolone, and 17α-OH pregnenolone were similar to or slightly higher than measured with WT P450 17A1 (Table 2). These results are interpreted to mean that changes in the substrate-binding affinities of the three variants are not primarily responsible for the decreased enzymatic activities, which were observed even at high substrate concentrations (Fig. 3).Table 2Kd values of P450 17A1·substrate complexesP450 17A1 variantSubstrateProgesterone, μM17-OH progesterone, μMPregnenolone, μM17-OH pregnenolone, μMWT0.065 ± 0.0490.15 ± 0.010.14 ± 0.060.11 ± 0.05E305G0.17 ± 0.080.22 ± 0.170.26 ± 0.080.41 ± 0.18R347H0.23 ± 0.100.11 ± 0.120.12 ± 0.050.22 ± 0.10R358Q0.26 ± 0.120.17 ± 0.110.15 ± 0.060.26 ± 0.12 Open table in a new tab The lyase catalytic activities of P450 17A1 are strongly stimulated by b5 (20Katagiri M.

WT P450 17A1 lyase activities were stimulated by b5 in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 4). However, the R347H and R358Q variants did not display b5 concentration-dependent stimulation in either of the lyase reactions. The E305G variant displayed weak b5 stimulation of the 17α-OH progesterone lyase reaction but not the 17α-OH pregnenolone lyase reaction (Fig. 4, C and D). WT b5 has no cysteine residues, and the T70C substitution in b5 was chosen based on previous studies of fluorescent labeling with an acrylodan derivative and interactions of that modified protein with bacterial and other hemeproteins (40Stayton P.S.

The “Blue Reagent” provided much more sensitivity, and the resulting Blue-T70C-b5 protein stimulated the lyase reactions of (WT) P450 17A1 with both 17-OH progesterone and 17-OH pregnenolone as substrates, in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. S4). The spectral properties of the Blue derivative suggested that the dye is Alexa 488 (or a closely related molecule), which is commercially available as a maleimide derivative for attachment to cysteine residues, and the protein modified with Alexa 488 (Alexa 488-T70C-b5) also stimulated the lyase reactions (results not shown). The fluorescence spectrum of Alexa 488-T70C-b5 showed an emission maximum at 513 nm (excitation wavelength of 480 nm) (Fig. 5), and the fluorescence emission displayed linearity with respect to the concentration of Alexa 488-T70C-b5 (Fig. S5). Titration of Alexa 488-T70C-b5 with WT P450 17A1 caused a loss of fluorescence intensity, indicating the perturbation of fluorescence by binding between Alexa 488-T70C-b5 and P450 17A1 (Fig. 5). Fitting of the loss of fluorescence with increased concentrations of P450 17A1 (using a quadratic equation) provided Kd values for the affinity of Alexa 488-T70C-b5 and P450 17A1 (Fig. 6 and Table 3). The apparent Kd value for WT P450 17A1 was ∼2.5 nM (Fig. 6 and Table 3), indicating very tight binding.Figure 6Fitting of binding titrations of Alexa 488-T70C-b5 with P450 17A1 WT and variants.

Open table in a new tab With the three clinical variants, very little change in fluorescence spectra was observed in the binding titrations of Alexa 488-T70C-b5, indicating weak or no binding interaction between the b5 protein and the variant enzymes (Fig. 6). The effects of P450 17A1 substrates on the binding affinity of b5 and P450 17A1 were examined (Fig. S6 and Table 3). Very tight binding affinities (Kd: 2.2–12 nM) were observed for WT P450 17A1/Alexa 488-T70C-b5 in the presence of each of the four substrates (present at 10 μM), not substantially altered from the binding of Alexa 488-T70C-b5 in the absence of substrate. The variants did not show binding in the presence or absence of substrates in the titrations (Fig. S6). The loss of Alexa 488-T70C-b5 fluorescence induced by binding of P450 17A1 was partially reversed by titration with POR (Fig. 7). The P450 interaction of POR appeared to be competitive with Alexa 488-T70C-b5, but the original fluorescence values were never reached. The calculated Kd value of POR (for the WT P450 17A1:Alexa 488-T70C-b5 complex) was 0.11 μM, suggesting much lower affinity than b5 with P450 17A1 (Fig. 7). The rate of binding of Alexa 488-T70C-b5 to (WT) P450 17A1 was measured by observing attenuation of fluorescence upon mixing the two proteins in a stopped-flow fluorimeter. When concentrations of 0.50 μM Alexa 488-T70C-b5 and 0.50 μM P450 17A1 were mixed, the first-order kobs value was 0.7 s−1 (Fig. 8, A and B). The loss of Alexa 488-T70C-b5 fluorescence induced by binding of P450 17A1 was reversed by adding unlabeled b5 protein (data not presented), indicating that the unlabeled b5 replaces Alexa 488-T70C-b5 in interacting with P450 17A1. When the kinetics were measured, the reaction occurred at a rate of 1.9 s−1 (Fig. 8, C and D). This value is considered to be the first-order koff rate. In principle, for binding reactions in a freely reversible system, kobs = kon + koff (46Johnson K.A. Kinetic Analysis for the New Enzymology.1st Ed. KinTek, Austin, TX2019Google Scholar), but the apparent koff rate here was higher than the kobs (on) rate. Thus, the true kon rate cannot be calculated from these measurements. However, the fluorescence traces clearly show that the binding and dissociation events are both occurring with rates of ∼1 s−1. Peptides were obtained corresponding to the putative binding sites of P450 17A1 and b5 (see Experimental procedures section a"
https://openalex.org/W3138639430,"Background Vitamin D deficiency has been associated with acute respiratory infection (ARI) in early life, but this has not been evaluated in Indonesia. We aimed to determine the incidence of ARI in Indonesian infants, and to evaluate the association with vitamin D deficiency. Methods From 23 December 2015 to 31 December 2017, we conducted a community-based prospective cohort study in Yogyakarta province. We enrolled 422 pregnant women and followed their infants from birth until 12 months of age for ARI episodes. Vitamin D status was measured at birth and at age six months. We performed Cox proportional hazard regression analysis to evaluate the association between vitamin D deficiency and pneumonia incidence. Results At study completion, 95% (400/422) of infants retained with a total of 412 child years of observation (CYO). The incidence of all ARI and of WHO-defined pneumonia was 3.89 (95% CI 3.70–4.08) and 0.25 (95% CI 0.21–0.30) episodes per CYO respectively. Vitamin D deficiency at birth was common (90%, 308/344) and associated with more frequent episodes of ARI non-pneumonia (adjusted odds ratio 4.48, 95% CI:1.04–19.34). Vitamin D status at birth or six months was not associated with subsequent pneumonia incidence, but greater maternal sun exposure during pregnancy was associated with a trend to less frequent ARI and pneumonia in infants. Conclusion ARI, pneumonia, and vitamin D deficiency at birth were common in Indonesian infants. Minimising vitamin D deficiency at birth such as by supplementation of mothers or safe sun exposure during pregnancy has the potential to reduce ARI incidence in infants in this setting."
https://openalex.org/W3138738012,"Background Despite the significant advantages of timely initiation of breastfeeding (TIBF), many countries particularly low- and middle-income countries have failed to initiate breastfeeding on time for their newborns. Optimal breastfeeding is one of the key components of the SDG that may help to achieve reduction of under-five mortality to 25 deaths per 1000 live births. Objective To assess the pooled prevalence and associated factors of timely initiation of breastfeeding among mothers having children less than two years of age in sub-Saharan Africa. Methods We used pooled data from the 35 sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS). We used a total weighted sample of 101,815 women who ever breastfeed and who had living children under 2 years of age. We conducted the multilevel logistic regression and variables with p&lt;0.05, in the multivariable analysis, were declared significantly associated with TIBF. Results The pooled prevalence of TIBF in SSA was 58.3% [95%CI; 58.0–58.6%] with huge variation between countries, ranging from 24% in Chad to 86% in Burundi. Both individual and community level variables were associated with TIBF. Among individual-level factors; being older-aged mothers, having primary education, being from wealthier households, exposure to mass media, being multiparous, intended pregnancy, delivery at a health facility, vaginal delivery, single birth, and average size of the child at birth were associated with higher odds of TIBF. Of community-level factors, rural place of residence, higher community level of ANC utilization, and health facility delivery were associated with higher odds of TIBF. Conclusion In this study, the prevalence of TIBF in SSA was low. Both individual and community-level factors were associated with TIBF. The authors recommend interventions at both individual and community levels to increase ANC utilization as well as health facility delivery that are crucial for advertising optimal breastfeeding practices such as TIBF."

Loss of proteostasis has been linked to numerous neurodegenerative disorders including Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and Huntington's disease. Hsp110 is related to the canonical Hsp70 class of protein-folding molecular chaperones and interacts with Hsp70 as a nucleotide exchange factor (NEF). In addition to its NEF activity, Hsp110 possesses an Hsp70-like substrate-binding domain (SBD) whose biological roles remain undefined. Previous work in Drosophila melanogaster has implicated the sole Hsp110 gene (Hsc70cb) in proteinopathic neurodegeneration. We hypothesize that in addition to its role as an Hsp70 NEF, Drosophila Hsp110 may function as a protective protein ""holdase,"" preventing the aggregation of unfolded polypeptides via the SBD-β subdomain. We demonstrate for the first time that Drosophila Hsp110 effectively prevents aggregation of the model substrate citrate synthase. We also report the discovery of a redundant and heretofore unknown potent holdase capacity in a 138-amino-acid region of Hsp110 carboxyl terminal to both SBD-β and SBD-α (henceforth called the C-terminal extension). This sequence is highly conserved in metazoan Hsp110 genes, completely absent from fungal representatives, and is computationally predicted to contain an intrinsically disordered region (IDR). We demonstrate that this IDR sequence within the human Hsp110s, Apg-1 and Hsp105α, inhibits the formation of amyloid Aβ-42 and α-synuclein fibrils in vitro but cannot mediate fibril disassembly.

Molecular chaperones support cellular protein homeostasis (proteostasis) by assisting in the proper folding and assembly of nascent polypeptide chains, regulating activity and interactions of mature proteins, and shepherding damaged or short-lived proteins to degradation pathways (1Hartl F.U. Bracher A. Hayer-Hartl M. Molecular chaperones in protein folding and proteostasis.Nature. 2011; 475: 324-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (2080) Google Scholar). Environmental stressors such as oxidation, heat shock, or starvation are especially detrimental to incompletely folded proteins that have a propensity to misfold and form aggregates. In a balanced proteostatic network, molecular chaperones such as Hsp70 and its cofactors prevent or reverse protein aggregation caused by partially or misfolded polypeptides (2Lindquist S.

The misfolding of amyloidogenic polypeptides leads to the formation of structured oligomers that act as seeding elements for other amyloid-prone proteins as well as nonpathogenic polypeptides (9Kim Y.E.

Over time these amorphous oligomers form higher-order energetically favorable and toxic amyloid fibrils, which are difficult for the cell to disassemble. These occlusive fibrils, and likely the oligomeric intermediates that precede them, incorporate partially folded proteins, titrate chaperones away from nascent polypeptides, and contribute to overall cellular toxicity that ultimately results in neuronal cell death (5Hipp M.S.

Understanding the molecular mechanisms behind amyloidogenesis and its contribution to neurodegeneration can result in the development of therapeutics that halt or even reverse the progression of these devastating diseases. This is especially important given rapidly aging populations around the world, as many of these diseases, most notably Alzheimer’s disease, primarily affect persons aged 65 and older (5Hipp M.S.

The Drosophila melanogaster Hsp110 homolog Hsc70Cb, when overproduced in fly lines also expressing human Huntingtin (Htt) exon 1, prevents Htt aggregation and associated neurodegenerative phenotypes (17Zhang S.

Likewise, overexpression of Hsp110 mitigates protein aggregation and neurodegeneration in Parkinson’s and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) mouse models (13Nagy M. Fenton W.A. Li D. Furtak K.

Conversely, deletion of Hsp110 homologs in mice and Drosophila results in enhanced neurodegeneration resulting from increased amyloid formation of Alzheimer’s-linked Aβ1-42 and expanded polyglutamine protein, respectively (16Kuo Y.

Hsp110 is a member of the Hsp70 superfamily and as such shares the canonical Hsp70 architecture: an amino-terminal nucleotide-binding domain (NBD) followed by a short linker and a substrate-binding domain (SBD) comprising two subdomains termed SBD-β and SBD-α (Fig. 1A). SBD-β is a β-sandwich-containing putative substrate-binding site, while SBD-α is an α-helical sequence that, instead of clamping over the SBD-β region with associated peptide substrate as in all Hsp70 chaperones, binds to and stabilizes the Hsp110 NBD, promoting interaction with Hsp70 to form a stable heterodimer that facilitates nucleotide exchange (20Liu Q.

While the NEF activity of Hsp110 has been well characterized, the biological role of substrate binding by the chaperone remains elusive (22Bracher A. Verghese J.

In vitro studies have demonstrated that Hsp110 is a potent suppressor of protein aggregation in the absence of Hsp70, and SBD-β appears to dictate peptide binding in the yeast homolog Sse1 (25Garcia V.M.

Additionally, substrate binding by Sse1 is not required for the disaggregase activity exhibited by the Hsp40-Hsp70-Hsp110 triad (20Liu Q. Hendrickson W.A. Insights into Hsp70 chaperone activity from a crystal structure of the yeast Hsp110 Sse1.Cell. 2007; 131: 106-120Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). Moreover, Hsp110 appears to optimally function as an NEF at a 1:10 ratio with respect to Hsp70, significantly inhibiting Hsp70 activity at higher levels (14Wentink A.S. Nillegoda N.B. Feufel J. Ubartaitė G. Schneider C.P. De Los Rios P. Hennig J. Barducci A. Bukau B.

This stoichiometry is inconsistent with the clear amyloid-suppressing effects observed upon overexpression in animal models of human neurodegenerative disease. Given the compelling protection from Htt-induced neurotoxicity provided by Hsp110 overexpression in flies, we interrogated protein aggregation inhibition by fly Hsp110 through mutational analysis and revealed a previously undiscovered second substrate-binding site in the extreme carboxyl terminus. This region, henceforth referred to as the C-terminal extension, is absent in yeast Sse1 but conserved in Hsp110 genes from metazoans. We demonstrate that an intrinsically disordered region (IDR) within the C-terminal extension is both necessary and sufficient for classic passive chaperone holdase activity. Importantly, we show using thioflavin T binding assays and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) that the IDR of both fly Hsp110 and human Hsp105α and Apg-1 Hsp110 homologs prevents the fibrilization of Aβ1-42 and α-synuclein, the highly amyloidogenic peptides involved in Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s disease pathology, respectively. Our results support the conclusion that metazoan Hsp110 chaperones possess two distinct passive, yet potent, substrate-binding activities and raise the possibility of their exploitation for therapeutic chaperone intervention in age-related neurodegenerative diseases. Previous studies by us and others have established the substrate-binding capacity of the SBD-β subdomain in vitro using yeast and mammalian Hsp110 homologs without developing a clear understanding of the biological relevance of this chaperone property (25Garcia V.M. Nillegoda N.B. Bukau B. Morano K.A. Substrate binding by the yeast Hsp110 nucleotide exchange factor and molecular chaperone Sse1 is not obligate for its biological activities.Mol. Biol.

To better explore the in vivo roles of Hsp110 substrate binding with respect to proteostasis and neurodegenerative disease, we turned our attention to the fruit fly, D. melanogaster, which possesses a single Hsp110 homolog encoded by the Hsc70cb gene (30McGurk L. Berson A. Bonini N.M. Drosophila as an in vivo model for human neurodegenerative disease.Genetics. 2015; 201: 377-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar, 31Moloney A. Sattelle D.B. Lomas D.A.

Jackson G.R. Drosophila models of neurodegenerative disease.NeuroRx. 2005; 2: 438-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). We purified the Hsc70cb-encoded protein with an added amino-terminal hexa-histidine tag (subsequently termed Hsp110) in Escherichia coli cells and utilized a standard spectrophotometric microplate light scattering assay to assess the ability of Drosophila Hsp110 to prevent protein aggregation of chemically denatured citrate synthase (CS) (Fig. S1A) (33Garcia V.M. Rowlett V.W. Margolin W. Morano K.A. Semi-automated microplate monitoring of protein polymerization and aggregation.Anal. Biochem. 2016; 508: 9-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). Hsp110 potently suppressed CS aggregation in a dose-dependent manner with approximately 50% efficacy at a 1:1 ratio of chaperone to substrate. Stronger aggregate inhibition was observed at 2:1 and 4:1 ratios, indicating that Hsp110 prevents aggregation in a manner similar to other homologs (Fig. S1, B and C) (21Polier S. Hartl F.U.

Chem. 2004; 279: 21992-22001Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). We additionally validated the assay conditions by demonstrating that the nonspecific protein bovine serum albumin (BSA) was unable to prevent CS aggregation (Fig. S2A). To verify that the increase in light scatter was indeed indicative of protein aggregation, we subjected samples obtained from the assay after 30 min to differential centrifugation to separate soluble and insoluble materials. While both Hsp110 and BSA remained in the supernatant fraction, only Hsp110 was capable of preventing CS from entering the pellet (Fig. S2C). To further understand the mechanism by which aggregation prevention occurs, a series of deletion mutations were made in the SBD-β subdomain. Five deletion constructs were generated that removed portions or all of SBD-β, including the short hydrophobic linker connecting the NBD to SBD-β (Fig. S3A). SBD-β deletion mutants were stably expressed, purified, and screened for chaperone activity (Fig. S3, B–D). Surprisingly, we found that partial or complete removal of SBD-β had no significant deleterious effect on aggregation suppression by Hsp110 (Fig. 1, A–C and Fig. S3, C and D). Moreover, we noted that removal of SBD-β appeared to significantly enhance Hsp110 chaperoning activity to varying degrees. Interestingly, not only does removal of SBD-β fail to disrupt prevention of CS aggregation, but Hsp110ΔSBDβ appears to be a much more potent holdase than full-length Hsp110 as demonstrated via differential centrifugation, with only 4% of CS remaining in the pellet fraction (Fig. 1D). To confirm that all our observations were not specific to the CS substrate used in the assays, we repeated the light scatter chaperone experiments using chemically denatured firefly luciferase and obtained similar results, including enhanced chaperone activity at equivalent chaperone to substrate ratios (2:1) (Fig. S4). Together, these data indicate that the Drosophila Hsp110 SBD-β is expendable for holdase activity, suggesting the presence of an additional substrate-binding site within the chaperone. Previous work using Chinese hamster (Cricetulus griseus) Hsp110 demonstrated that the NBD does not possess holdase activity as assessed using firefly luciferase (27Oh H.J. Easton D. Murawski M. Kaneko Y. Subjeck J.R. The chaperoning activity of Hsp110: Identification of functional domains by use of targeted deletions.J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 15712-15718Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Consistently, we found that purified Drosophila Hsp110 NBD likewise was incapable of preventing aggregation of CS as demonstrated using both light scattering and differential centrifugation assays (Fig. 2). We noted that unlike the yeast Hsp110 Sse1, Drosophila Hsp110 possesses a carboxyl-terminal extension (C-term) of approximately 106 additional amino acids (Fig. S5). To assess whether this previously unstudied region may contribute to chaperone activity, we fused the C-term to the NBD and tested this purified protein for holdase function (Fig. S1A). Remarkably, the NBD–C-term hybrid protein exhibited potent aggregate suppression activity (Fig. 2, A–C). Differential centrifugation confirmed the light scatter assay results, demonstrating that all of the NBD–C-term protein and the majority of unfolded CS remained in the soluble fraction after a 30 min incubation (Fig. 2D). Once again, we noted that like Hsp110ΔSBDβ, NBD-C-term appeared to be more efficient at aggregation prevention than full-length Hsp110. These findings demonstrate for the first time a second, previously unknown chaperoning site within a metazoan Hsp110 homolog that is capable of functioning independently of the canonical β-sandwich region (21Polier S. Hartl F.U. Bracher A. Interaction of the Hsp110 molecular chaperones from S. cerevisiae with substrate protein.J. Mol. Biol. 2010; 401: 696-707Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 27Oh H.J.

Chem. 1999; 274: 15712-15718Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). To more precisely map sequences conferring holdase activity within the C-term, we explored the Drosophila Hsp110 protein sequence to identify potential structural element boundaries to aid in design of additional deletions and truncations. As no full-length structures are available for Drosophila or any other metazoan Hsp110 homologs, we turned to in silico analysis. Using the protein disorder prediction package DISOPRED3, we identified two potential regions with high confidence scores for intrinsic disorder and the potential for protein binding (Fig. 3A) (35Jones D.T. Cozzetto D. DISOPRED3: Precise disordered region predictions with annotated protein-binding activity.Bioinformatics. 2015; 31: 857-863Crossref PubMed Scopus (455) Google Scholar, 36Ward J.J.

Of the two sites identified by the prediction software, one mapped to the extended loop region (residues 508–544) within SBD-β that differentiates this domain from the more distantly related Hsp70 superfamily homologs and another to the terminal 53 amino acids (residues 751–804) of the protein localized within the C-term region demonstrated to possess chaperone activity in Figure 2 (Fig. 3B). Previous studies have revealed that IDRs can act as sites of protein binding, assuming order when interacting with other proteins and peptides (37Boczek E.E. Alberti S. One domain fits all: Using disordered regions to sequester misfolded proteins.J. Cell Biol. 2018; 217: 1173-1175Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). This property is exploited by some protein chaperones. For example, the antiaggregation/sequestration activity of the small heat shock protein (sHsp) family is mediated in part by IDRs (38Tsai C. Aslam K. Drendel H.M. Asiago J.M. Goode K.M. Paul L.N. Rochet J.-C. Hazbun T.R. Hsp31 is a stress response chaperone that intervenes in the protein misfolding process.J. Biol.

Small heat shock proteins, big impact on protein aggregation in neurodegenerative disease.Front. Pharmacol. 2019; 10: 1047Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The localization of this IDR within the C-terminal extension made it a region of interest as a potential site for substrate–chaperone interaction. We therefore appended the predicted IDR to the NBD to create NBD-IDR and found that the IDR conferred robust aggregation prevention to the NBD (Fig. 3, C and D). The holdase activity observed in the C-term domain of Hsp110 is thus due to the 53 amino acids composing a predicted IDR at the extreme carboxyl terminus. Overall, these results confirm the presence of substrate-binding capacity in the C-terminal extension mediated by a 53-amino-acid IDR. Clustal Omega sequence alignment revealed that the C-terminal extension is present in several metazoan Hsp110 homologs including bovine, chimpanzee, orangutan, and the African clawed frog, among others (Fig. S5) (42Sievers F. Higgins D.G. Clustal Omega for making accurate alignments of many protein sequences.Protein Sci. 2018; 27: 135-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (628) Google Scholar). Notably, the C-term extension and IDR appear to be conserved in the human Hsp110 homologs Apg-1and Hsp105α (Figs. S5 and 4A). While these regions are not strictly conserved among species in terms of sequence, there appears to be conservation in terms of amino acid characteristics and biochemical properties (43Trivedi R.

https://openalex.org/W3137042356,"Introduction This study analyzed the impact of a categorized approach, based on patients’ prognosis, on major outcomes and explanators in patients hospitalized for COVID-19 pneumonia in an academic center in Spain. Methods Retrospective cohort study (March 3 to May 2, 2020). Patients were categorized according to the followed clinical management, as maximum care or limited therapeutic effort (LTE). Main outcomes were all-cause mortality and need for invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV). Baseline factors associated with outcomes were analyzed by multiple logistic regression, estimating odds ratios (OR; 95%CI). Results Thirty-hundred and six patients were hospitalized, median age 65.0 years, 57.8% males, 53.3% Charlson index ≥3. The overall all-cause fatality rate was 15.0% (n = 46). Maximum care was provided in 238 (77.8%), IMV was used in 38 patients (16.0%), and 5.5% died. LTE was decided in 68 patients (22.2%), none received IMV and fatality was 48.5%. Independent risk factors of mortality under maximum care were lymphocytes &lt;790/mm 3 , troponin T &gt;15ng/L and hypotension. Advanced age, lymphocytes &lt;790/mm 3 and BNP &gt;240pg/mL independently associated with IMV requirement. Conclusion Overall fatality in the cohort was 15% but markedly varied regarding the decided approach (maximum care versus LTE), translating into nine-fold higher mortality and different risk factors."
https://openalex.org/W3137321181,"Background The U.S. immigration system mandates that persons seeking asylum prove their persecution claim is credible and their fear of returning home is well-founded. However, this population represents a highly trauma-exposed group, with neuropsychiatric symptoms consequent to prior torture or maltreatment that may interfere with cognitive function and their ability to recall their trauma. These memory lapses may be incorrectly perceived by asylum adjudicators as indicators of dishonesty and jeopardize the person’s credibility and asylum claim. Our retrospective mixed methods study seeks to present associations between trauma and memory loss in a sample of persons seeking asylum to the U.S. and describe how memory impairments manifest in this trauma-exposed population. Methods We randomly selected 200 medico-legal affidavits from 1346 affidavits collected in the past 30 years, as part of the Physicians for Human Rights Asylum Network connecting clinicians with legal providers for medical and/or psychiatric affidavits of U.S. asylum seekers and persons seeking other forms of humanitarian relief (hereafter, “asylum seekers”). Data was extracted from these affidavits using a coding manual informed by the Istanbul Protocol, the global standard for torture documentation. Seven affidavits were excluded due to missing age. We used multiple logistic regression to assess the association of memory loss with neuropsychiatric diagnoses: head trauma, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and depression. We supplemented these findings with a qualitative content analysis of the affidavits documenting memory loss. Memory loss presented among the asylum seekers’ affidavits in several ways: memory gaps of the traumatic event; challenges with presenting a clear chronology of the trauma, avoidance of traumatic memories, and persistent short-term memory loss interfering with daily activity. Results A majority of the sample received a neuropsychiatric diagnosis: 69% (n = 132) of asylum-seekers received a diagnosis of PTSD and 55% (n = 106) of depression. Head trauma was reported among 30% (n = 58) of affidavits. Further, 68% (n = 131) reported being subject to physical violence and 20% (n = 39) were documented as being at risk of suicide. Memory loss was documented among 21% (n = 40) asylum-seekers. In adjusted models, both PTSD and depression, but not head trauma, were associated with memory loss (p&lt;0.05). Conclusion Stakeholders in the asylum process, spanning the medical, legal and immigration enforcement sectors, must be aware of the interplay of trauma and memory loss and how they might impact immigration proceedings for this vulnerable population."
https://openalex.org/W3137549971,"Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis is a progressive and debilitating lung disease with large unmet medical need and few treatment options. We describe an analysis connecting single cell gene expression with bulk gene expression-based subsetting of patient cohorts to identify IPF patient subsets with different underlying pathogenesis and cellular changes. We reproduced earlier findings indicating the existence of two major subsets in IPF and showed that these subsets display different alterations in cellular composition of the lung. We developed classifiers based on the cellular changes in disease to distinguish subsets. Specifically, we showed that one subset of IPF patients had significant increases in gene signature scores for myeloid cells versus a second subset that had significantly increased gene signature scores for ciliated epithelial cells, suggesting a differential pathogenesis among IPF subsets. Ligand-receptor analyses suggested there was a monocyte-macrophage chemoattractant axis (including potentially CCL2-CCR2 and CCL17-CCR4) among the myeloid-enriched IPF subset and a ciliated epithelium-derived chemokine axis (e.g. CCL15) among the ciliated epithelium-enriched IPF subset. We also found that these IPF subsets had differential expression of pirfenidone-responsive genes suggesting that our findings may provide an approach to identify patients with differential responses to pirfenidone and other drugs. We believe this work is an important step towards targeted therapies and biomarkers of response."
https://openalex.org/W3137894150,"Neonatal hypothermia is a great concern with near epidemic levels globally. In Kenya, its prevalence is as high as 87% with limited local data on the associated factors such as adherence to warm chain guidelines as recommended by the World Health Organisation (WHO) is limited. This study aimed to determine the prevalence of hypothermia and level of adherence to the WHO thermal care guidelines among newborns admitted at Moi Teaching and Referral Hospital (MTRH). It adopted a prospective study design of following up neonates for the first 24 hours of admission to the MTRH newborn unit. Thermometry, interview of mothers and observation of thermal care practices was done. Descriptive and inferential statistical techniques were adopted. Specifically, Pearson’s chi-square test of associations between predictors of neonatal hypothermia and management outcomes was conducted with their corresponding risk estimates at 95% confidence interval. Among the 372 participants, 64.5% (n = 240) were born at MTRH, 47.6% (177) were preterm and 53.2% (198) had birth weights below 2500 grams. Admission hypothermia was noted among 73.7% (274) and 13% (49) died on the first day of admission. Only 7.8% (29) newborns accessed optimal thermal care. Prematurity, day one mortality and adherence to the warm chain were significantly (p&lt;0.001) associated with admission hypothermia. Inappropriate thermal appliance, inadequate clothing and late breastfeeding significantly increased the risk of neonatal hypothermia. Absence of admission hypothermia increased the likelihood of neonatal survival more than twenty-fold (AOR = 20.91, 95% CI: 2.15–153.62). Three out four neonates enrolled had admission hypothermia which was significantly associated with prematurity, lack of adherence to warm chain and increased risk of neonatal mortality on the first day of life. There was low adherence to the WHO thermal care guidelines. This should be optimized among preterm neonates to improve likelihood of survival."
https://openalex.org/W3137945032,"Although essential for reconstructing hominin behaviour during the Early Palaeolithic, only a handful of Acheulean sites have been dated in the Eastern Sahara region. This is due to the scarcity of sites for this time period and the lack of datable material. However, recent excavations in the Atbara region (Sudan) have provided unique opportunities to analyse and date Acheulean stone tools. We report here on EDAR 7, part of a cluster of Acheulean and Middle Stone Age (MSA) sites that were recently discovered in the Eastern Desert Atbara River (EDAR) region, located in the Eastern Desert (Sudan) far from the Nile valley. At EDAR 7, a 3.5 metre sedimentary sequence was excavated, allowing an Acheulean assemblage to be investigated using a combination of sedimentology, stone tool studies and optically stimulated luminescence dating (OSL). The site has delivered a complete Acheulean knapping chaine opératoire , providing new information about the Saharan Acheulean. The EDAR 7 site is interpreted as a remnant of a campsite based on the co-occurrence of two reduction modes: one geared towards the production of Large Cutting Tools (LCTs), and the other based on the flaking of small debitage and production of flake tools. Particularly notable in the EDAR 7 assemblage is the abundance of cleavers, most of which display evidence of flake production. Implementation of giant Kombewa flakes was also observed. A geometric morphometric analysis of hand-axes was conducted to verify a possible Late Acheulean assemblage standardisation in the Nubian Sahara. In addition, the analysis of micro-traces and wear on the artefacts has provided information on the use history of the Acheulean stone tools. Sediment analyses and OSL dating show that the EDAR 7 sequence contains the oldest Acheulean encampment remains in the Eastern Sahara, dated to the MIS 11 or earlier. This confirms that Homo erectus occupied the EDAR region during Middle Pleistocene humid periods, and demonstrates that habitable corridors existed between the Ethiopian Highlands, the Nile and the Red Sea coast, allowing population dispersals across the continent and out of it."
https://openalex.org/W3136440530,"Vagally mediated heart rate variability (HRV) is a psychophysiological indicator of mental and physical health. Limited research suggests there is reduced vagal activity and resulting lower HRV in patients with Major Depressive Disorder (MDD); however little is actually known about the association between HRV and symptoms of depression and whether the association mirrors symptom improvement following psychotherapy. The aim of this study was to investigate the association between antidepressant therapy, symptom change and HRV in 50 inpatients (68% females; 17–68 years) with a diagnosis of MDD. Severity of depressive symptoms was assessed by self-report (Beck Depression Inventory II) and the Hamilton Rating Scale of Depression. Measures of vagally mediated HRV (root mean square of successive differences and high-frequency) were assessed at multiple measurement points before and after inpatient psychotherapeutic and psychiatric treatment. Results showed an expected negative correlation between HRV and depressive symptoms at intake. Depressive symptoms improved (d = 0.84) without corresponding change in HRV, demonstrating a de-coupling between this psychophysiological indicator and symptom severity. To our knowledge, this study is the first to examine an association between HRV and depressive symptoms before and after psychotherapy. The observed de-coupling of depression and HRV, and its methodological implications for future research are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W3136645800,"Animals have evolved the capacity to learn, and the conventional view is that learning allows individuals to improve foraging decisions. The parasitoid Telenomus podisi has been shown to parasitize eggs of the exotic stink bug Halyomorpha halys at the same rate as eggs of its coevolved host, Podisus maculiventris , but the parasitoid cannot complete its development in the exotic species. We hypothesized that T . podisi learns to exploit cues from this non-coevolved species, thereby increasing unsuccessful parasitism rates. We conducted bioassays to compare the responses of naïve vs . experienced parasitoids on chemical footprints left by one of the two host species. Both naïve and experienced females showed a higher response to footprints of P . maculiventris than of H . halys . Furthermore, parasitoids that gained an experience on H . halys significantly increased their residence time within the arena and the frequency of re-encounter with the area contaminated by chemical cues. Hence, our study describes detrimental learning where a parasitoid learns to associate chemical cues from an unsuitable host, potentially re-enforcing a reproductive cul-de-sac (evolutionary trap). Maladaptive learning in the T . podisi — H . halys association could have consequences for population dynamics of sympatric native and exotic host species."

Loss-of-function variants in NUDT15 are strongly associated with thiopurine intolerance, such as leukopenia, and preemptive NUDT15 genotyping has been clinically implemented to personalize thiopurine dosing. However, understanding the molecular consequences of these variants has been difficult, as no structural information was available for NUDT15 proteins encoded by clinically actionable pharmacogenetic variants because of their inherent instability.

NUDT15 belongs to the NUDIX (nucleoside diphosphates linked to a moiety x) superfamily of proteins, which are characterized by containing a conserved NUDIX box motif (GX5EX7REVXEEXGU, where U is a hydrophobic residue). These enzymes metabolize a diverse range of substrates including canonical (d)NTPs, oxidized (d)NTPs, nonnucleoside polyphosphates, and capped mRNAs (1Bessman M.J. Frick D.N. O'Handley S.F.

NUDT15 (also known as MTH2) was originally proposed to have a similar function to another NUDIX family member MTH1 (MutT homolog 1), which efficiently hydrolyses oxidized nucleotides, preventing their incorporation into DNA and thereby sanitizing the cellular nucleotide pool (2Gad H.

Thiopurine drugs are metabolized into cytotoxic guanosine analog metabolites and are commonly used for treating diseases such as acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), acute myeloid leukemia (AML), and inflammatory bowel disease (8Bradford K.

These compounds are ultimately converted to the cellularly active metabolites 6-thio-GTP and 6-thio-dGTP. After 6-thio-dGTP is incorporated into DNA, it is methylated (10Nelson J.A. Carpenter J.W.

This is often a result of genetic polymorphism in genes encoding proteins such as thiopurine S-methyltransferase (TPMT), which inactivate thiopurines including 6-mercaptopurine and 6-TG. These variants in TPMT therefore lead to excessive accumulation of thioguanine in the genome, which ultimately causes the severe hematopoietic toxicity observed in patients undergoing thiopurine-based chemotherapy (15Lennard L.

Similar to TPMT, loss-of-function variants in NUDT15 are also strongly associated with thiopurine toxicity, because of increased incorporation of 6-thio-dGTP into DNA. It is becoming increasingly clear that thiopurine treatment strategies need to include both NUDT15 and TPMT genotyping to identify patients at-risk of hematopoietic toxicities (20Relling M.V. Schwab M. Whirl-Carrillo M. Suarez-Kurtz G. Pui C.H. Stein C.M. Moyer A.M. Evans W.E. Klein T.E. Antillon-Klussmann F.G. Caudle K.E. Kato M. Yeoh A.E.J. Schmiegelow K. Yang J.J.

This is a particularly important consideration for certain racial/ethnic groups as loss-of-function NUDT15 variants are more common in people of Asian or Hispanic descent compared with Caucasians (5Yang S.K.

A recent study on a cohort of 270 children diagnosed with ALL and treated with thiopurines identified four mutations in the NUDT15 gene (7Moriyama T. Nishii R. Perez-Andreu V. Yang W. Klussmann F.A. Zhao X. Lin T.N. Hoshitsuki K. Nersting J. Kihira K. Hofmann U. Komada Y. Kato M. McCorkle R. Li L. et al.NUDT15 polymorphisms alter thiopurine metabolism and hematopoietic toxicity.Nat. Genet. 2016; 48: 367-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar), which showed a 74.4% to 100% loss of activity, relative to the WT enzyme. The identified mutations included three single point mutants c.415C>T (Arg139Cys), c.416G>A (Arg139His), c.52G>A (Val18Ile) and a fourth mutant c.36_37insGGAGTC (Val18_Val19insGlyVal), where a microsatellite expansion results in an in-frame insertion of two residues (glycine and valine). The additional residues are inserted into a segment already containing three glycine–valine repeats and the insertion therefore extends this segment by a single Gly-Val repetition. Based on the activity of NUDT15 toward 6-thio(d)GTP, which reduces cellular thiopurine toxicity, recent studies have also proposed NUDT15 inhibition as a means of improving thiopurine therapy in patients with WT NUDT15. Specifically, the first potent and selective small molecule NUDT15 inhibitor (TH1760) was recently shown to sensitize cells to thiopurines, through the enhanced incorporation of 6-thio-dGTP in DNA (22Zhang S.M. Desroses M. Hagenkort A. Valerie N.C.K. Rehling D. Carter M. Wallner O. Koolmeister T. Throup A. Jemth A.S. Almlof I. Loseva O. Lundback T. Axelsson H. Regmi S. et al.Development of a chemical probe against NUDT15.Nat. Chem. Biol. 2020; 16: 1120-1128Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). This may increase the effectiveness of thiopurine therapy by allowing lower doses of thiopurines to be used while still maintaining good therapeutic effect. In this study, we present the novel small-molecule NUDT15 inhibitor TH7755, which has substantially improved cellular target engagement as well as potentiation of 6-thio-guanine compared to TH1760. We solved the crystal structure of WT NUDT15 in complex with TH7755, which demonstrates that TH7755 adopts a highly similar binding mode to TH1760. Thermal shift analysis indicated that TH7755 significantly increased the stability of NUDT15. No structural information for clinically isolated NUDT15 mutations was previously available because of their inherent instability, which renders them very difficult to crystallize. We utilized the stabilizing effect of TH7755 to determine high-resolution crystal structures of the clinically relevant NUDT15 mutants Arg139Cys, Arg139His, Val18Ile, and V18_V19insGlyVal. Analysis of these structures in relation to the WT enzyme provides clear explanations for the detrimental phenotypic effects observed for these NUDT15 variants. We synthesized the new NUDT15 inhibitor TH7755 based on our previously developed inhibitor TH1760. TH7755 differs from TH1760 in that it contains two additional methyl groups, which are attached to the piperazine ring system and the nitrogen of the indole group (Fig. 1A). The inhibition of human and mouse NUTD15 by TH7755 was determined in vitro using a malachite green–based assay (3Carter M. Jemth A.-S. Hagenkort A. Page B.D. Gustafsson R. Griese J.J. Gad H.

The IC50 values of TH7755 for human and mouse were 30 nM (pIC50 = 7.53 ± 0.03, n = 2) and 144 nM (pIC50 = 6.84 ± 0.02, n = 2), respectively, (Fig. 1, B and C), indicating that the affinity of the inhibitor is higher for the human isoform of the enzyme. The IC50 value of TH7755 for human NUDT15 is very similar to the IC50 value previously reported for TH1760 (25 nM) (22Zhang S.M. Desroses M. Hagenkort A. Valerie N.C.K. Rehling D. Carter M. Wallner O. Koolmeister T. Throup A. Jemth A.S. Almlof I. Loseva O. Lundback T. Axelsson H. Regmi S. et al.Development of a chemical probe against NUDT15.Nat. Chem. Biol. 2020; 16: 1120-1128Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). To investigate the ability of TH7755 to engage with NUDT15 in cells, we used the cellular thermal shift assay (CETSA) method. Intact AML HL-60 cells were incubated with either TH7755, TH1760, or dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) only, after which the cells were heated, lysed, and the thermal stability of cellular NUDT15 was examined by Western blot analysis. At a concentration of 10 μM TH7755 substantially stabilized cellular NUDT15 from heat-induced denaturation and precipitation, as indicated by an increase of 4 °C for the apparent aggregation temperature (Tagg) of NUDT15. Importantly, this significant stabilization strongly suggests TH7755 binds to NUDT15 in the cell (Fig. 1, D–F). In contrast, at the same concentration, the inhibitor TH1760 only increased the Tagg of NUDT15 by 1 °C. The potency of target engagement by TH7755 was further investigated using isothermal dose–response fingerprint CETSA (ITDRFCETSA), where intact HL-60 cells were treated with increasing concentrations of TH7755 before the thermal stability of cellular NUDT15 was determined at a constant screening temperature. TH7755 consistently engaged and thereby stabilized cellular NUDT15, which was observed to start at a concentration of 1 μM and increased with increasing TH7755 concentration (Fig. 1, G and H). Collectively, our CETSA data show that TH7755 engages efficiently with NUDT15 in HL-60 cells and to a larger extent compared with TH1760. Loss of NUDT15 activity/expression has yet to be associated with an easily quantifiable phenotype. However, inhibition of NUDT15 6-thio-dGTPase activity leads to thiopurine hypersensitivity, which we previously exploited to analyze TH1760 (22Zhang S.M. Desroses M. Hagenkort A. Valerie N.C.K. Rehling D. Carter M. Wallner O. Koolmeister T. Throup A. Jemth A.S. Almlof I. Loseva O. Lundback T. Axelsson H. Regmi S. et al.Development of a chemical probe against NUDT15.Nat. Chem. Biol. 2020; 16: 1120-1128Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). To further characterize TH7755, AML HL-60 cells were treated with a dose–response concentration matrix of thiopurine (6-TG) and TH7755 for 4 days, after which cell viabilities were determined using a resazurin reduction cell viability assay. In agreement with its biochemical inhibitory activity against NUDT15, TH7755 increased the cytotoxicity of 6-TG, as evidenced by a decrease in the 6-TG cytotoxic EC50 (half maximal effective concentration), starting from concentrations as low as 50 nM. Importantly, TH7755 did not demonstrate measurable cytotoxicity when applied alone up to a concentration of 100 μM (Fig. 2, A and B). In agreement with the CETSA data, showing that TH7755 displays an enhanced ability to engage cellular NUDT15 compared with TH1760 (Fig. 1, D–F), TH7755 also displays a far superior in-cell activity as measured by 6-TG potentiation. TH7755 was shown to strongly synergize with 6-TG in NUDT15-proficient AML NB4 cells, which was effectively abrogated upon shRNA-mediated NUDT15 depletion, indicating that TH7755 enhanced 6-TG efficacy through specifically inhibiting NUDT15 (Fig. 2, C and D). To investigate the mode of inhibition of TH7755, we produced enzyme saturation curves of NUDT15, with 6-thio-dGTP as substrate, at five different TH7755 concentrations and determined kcat and Km values (Fig. S1, Table S1). We analyzed the dependence of kcat and Km on TH7755 concentration and found that while the Km clearly increased with increasing TH7755 concentration (Fig. S1B), the kcat remained unaltered (Fig. S1C), indicative of a competitive mode of inhibition. The Ki for TH7755 was determined to be 10.2 ± 0.9 nM in agreement with our calculated IC50 value for the compound. To analyze the inhibitory mechanism of TH7755, we determined the crystal structure of WT NUDT15 in complex with the inhibitor at a resolution of 1.6 Å. The overall structure of NUDT15 is a homodimer (Fig. 3A), consistent with size-exclusion chromatography and small-angle X-ray scattering experiments that show the enzyme is also dimeric in solution (3Carter M. Jemth A.-S. Hagenkort A. Page B.D. Gustafsson R. Griese J.J. Gad H. Valerie N.C. Desroses M. Boström J. Crystal structure, biochemical and cellular activities demonstrate separate functions of MTH1 and MTH2.Nat. Commun. 2015; 6: 7871Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The NUDT15 monomer is comprised of two alpha-helices (α1 and α2), seven beta-strands (β1–β7), and four 310 helices (η1–η4) (Fig. 3B). The individual monomers of NUDT15 have a classic NUDIX fold and are very similar to one another, as indicated by the low RMSD value of 0.47 Å for their corresponding Cα-atoms. Each active site contains clear density for a single TH7755 molecule, which is positioned deep within the binding pocket (Fig. 3C). TH7755 is coordinated by extensive hydrophobic and hydrogen bond interactions. The benzoxazolone moiety of TH7755 forms two direct hydrogen bonds with the main chain nitrogen atoms of Gly137 and Leu138 and is further supported by hydrophobic interactions with Leu45 and Phe135. The sulfonamide group of TH7755 is positioned by two interactions involving the main chain nitrogen of Val16 and the main chain oxygen of Thr94. The piperazine ring system of the compound is positioned exclusively by hydrophobic interactions from the residues Phe135, Tyr94, and His49. The piperazine ring has attained a chair conformation with the N-substituents in semi-equatorial orientations. This combined with its absolute R configuration forces the adjacent 2-methyl group on the piperazine into an axial orientation. The amide oxygen of TH7755 engages in water-mediated interactions with Arg34, which itself interacts with the side chain of Gln44 and the main chain oxygen of Val38. Finally, the indole group of the inhibitor is positioned by a perpendicular π-stacking interaction with Tyr90 and is further stabilized by hydrophobic interactions with Val38, Phe135, and Trp136 (Fig. 3C). Comparison of NUDT15-TH7755 with the previously reported NUDT15–TH1760 complex (22Zhang S.M. Desroses M. Hagenkort A. Valerie N.C.K. Rehling D. Carter M. Wallner O. Koolmeister T. Throup A. Jemth A.S. Almlof I. Loseva O. Lundback T. Axelsson H. Regmi S. et al.Development of a chemical probe against NUDT15.Nat. Chem. Biol. 2020; 16: 1120-1128Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar) shows that the overall structures superimpose very well, with a low RMSD value of 0.51 Å. There are no significant differences between the two structures with the exception of minor variations in two flexible loop regions. The overall binding mode of TH7755 is highly similar to TH1760, with the surrounding active site residues superimposing well between the structures (Fig. 3D). An interesting point of difference however is the indole ring system, which in TH7755 is flipped 180° relative to the TH1760 structure, likely a result of the additional methyl group present on the indole group of TH7755. To determine whether inhibitor and substrate binding has a significant stabilizing effect on WT and clinically relevant NUDT15 variants (R139C, R139H, V18I and Val18_Val19insGlyVal), we obtained thermal stability data using the technique differential scanning fluorimetry. In the absence of substrate (6-thio-GTP) or inhibitor (TH7755), all four mutant constructs were less thermally stable compared with WT NUDT15, as indicated by their lower melting temperatures (Tm) (Fig. 4A). The R139C and R139H mutants had larger decreases in Tm compared with WT NUDT15 (−9.4 and −8.2 °C, respectively) compared with the V18I and Val18_Val19insGlyVal constructs (−3.7 and −1.8 °C, respectively). Addition of 6-thio-GTP resulted in a similar stabilization for all of the constructs, with an average increase in Tm of +5 °C (Fig. 4A). TH7755 inhibitor binding had an even more impressive stabilizing effect on the protein, with an average increase in Tm of +11 °C for WT and mutant NUDT15 (Fig. 4A). We also performed thermal stability tests with the previously published inhibitor TH1760, which also significantly stabilizes the enzyme, with an average Tm increase of +11.5 °C for WT and mutant NUDT15 (Fig. 4A). In addition to investigating the thermal stability, we also tested the enzymatic activity of the WT and mutant NUDT15 constructs in vitro. The R139C, R139H, V18I, and Val18_Val19insGlyVal mutants all displayed reduced enzymatic activity relative to WT NUDT15, with a reduction in activity ranging from 65 to 85% (Fig. 4B). The NUDT15 mutant R139H was least active, followed by Val18_Val19insGlyVal, R139C, and lastly, V18I. Before this study, no structures of clinically relevant NUDT15 mutants had been determined, as their inherent instability rendered them difficult to crystallize. Previous studies aimed at elucidating the structural mechanisms that affect protein stability therefore had to draw conclusions based on WT NUDT15 structures, instead of using actual mutant NUDT15 structural data. By utilizing the impressive stabilizing effect of TH7755 on NUDT15, we were able to grow high-quality crystals and solve high-resolution crystal structures of the clinically relevant mutants R139C, R139H, V18I, and V18_V19insGV (Fig. 2, A–C). These NUDT15 variant structures are highly structurally similar to WT NUDT15-TH7755, as indicated by the low RMSD values for their corresponding Cα-atoms values of 0.47, 0.42, 0.45, and 0.44 Å, respectively. Comparison of these structures with WT NUDT15 in complex with TH7755 provides clear insights into the structural reasons for their reduced stability. We first solved the structure of the most common pharmacogenetic variant in NUDT15, R139C, to 1.4 Å resolution. The side chain of Cys139 (located in α2) adopts two conformations, one of which interacts with the main chain oxygen atoms of both Leu131 (located in η3) and Leu134 (located in a loop connecting α2 to η3) at distances of 3.2 and 3.4 Å, respectively (Fig. 5A). In our structure of WT NUDT15 in complex with TH7755, Arg139 forms interactions similar to what is observed in the R139C structure. This involves a single interaction with the main chain oxygen of Leu131 (at a distance of 2.9 Å) and two interactions with the main chain oxygen of Leu134 (at distances of 2.9 and 3.2 Å, respectively). Comparison of the R139C mutant structure with WT NUDT15 shows that α2 superimposes very well between the structures. However, in WT NUDT15, the 310-helix η3 is shifted slightly closer to α2, than what is observed in the mutant structure (Fig. 5D). We then determined the structure of another clinically relevant NUDT15 variant at position 139, the R139H, which we solved to 1.6 Å resolution. In contrast to WT and NUDT15 R139C where residue 139 is capable of interactions with both Leu131 and Leu134, the side chain of His139 only interacts with the main chain oxygen of Leu134, at a distance of 3.2 Å (Fig. 5B). As was observed for the R139C structure, comparison of R139H with WT NUDT15 shows α2 to superimpose very well between the structures, while the 310-helix η3 is positioned closer to α2 in the WT enzyme (Fig. 5E). We then solved the structure of the V18I variant to 1.5 Å resolution. Val18 is close to the dimer interface of NUDT15 and lies on the opposite side of the monomer relative to position 139, which is solvent exposed. The V18 site is located in β1 and is in close proximity to residues from the conserved NUDIX motif, which itself is comprised of a small beta-sheet (β4) linked by a loop region to an alpha-helix (α1). In our V18I mutant structure, the side chain of Ile18 is surrounded by residues from α1 (Thr64, Ala60, and Glu63), β1 (Val20), β4 (Gly47), β5 (Leu72) as well as the loop region connecting β4 and β5 (Pro46) (Fig. 5C). Comparison of the V18I mutant structure with WT NUDT15 shows that the secondary structure in this region superimposes very well between the proteins. However, the additional methyl group present in the side chain of Ile18 slightly disrupts the favorable hydrophobic packing interactions with Pro46, Gly47, and Glu63, which are present in the WT structure with its smaller valine side chain (Fig. 5F). Finally, we solved the structure of the NUDT15 V18_V19insGV mutant to a resolution of 1.5 Å. The V18_V19insGV mutation leads to an in-frame insertion of the residues glycine and valine into a segment on β1 that already contains three GlyVal repeats, thus extending it by one repetition (Fig. 6, A and B). While the residues Gly15 to Val20 in NUDT15 V18_V19insGV occupy the same position as Gly13 to Val18 in the WT structure, the insertion leads to the preceding residues being out of frame with one another (Fig. 6B). Comparison of the mutant structure with WT NUDT15 shows that β1 superimposes well between the structures. However, as mentioned abo"
https://openalex.org/W3136208967,"The growing number of drug-resistant bacterial infections worldwide is driving renewed interest in phage therapy. Based on the use of a personalized cocktail composed of highly specific bacterial viruses, this therapy relies on a range of tests on agar media to determine the most active phage on a given bacterial target (phage susceptibility testing), or to isolate new lytic phages from an environmental sample (enrichment of phage banks). However, these culture-based techniques are still solely interpreted through direct visual detection of plaques. The main objective of this work is to investigate computer-assisted methods in order to ease and accelerate diagnosis in phage therapy but also to study phage plaque growth kinetics. For this purpose, we designed a custom wide-field lensless imaging device, which allows continuous monitoring over a very large area sensor (3.3 cm2). Here we report bacterial susceptibility to Staphylococcus aureus phage in 3 hr and estimation of infectious titer in 8 hr 20 min. These are much shorter time-to-results than the 12 to 24 hours traditionally needed, since naked eye observation and counting of phage plaques is still the most widely used technique for susceptibility testing prior to phage therapy. Moreover, the continuous monitoring of the samples enables the study of plaque growth kinetics, which enables a deeper understanding of the interaction between phage and bacteria. Finally, thanks to the 4.3 μm resolution, we detect phage-resistant bacterial microcolonies of Klebsiella pneumoniae inside the boundaries of phage plaques and thus show that our prototype is also a suitable device to track phage resistance. Lensless imaging is therefore an all-in-one method that could easily be implemented in cost-effective and compact devices in phage laboratories to help with phage therapy diagnosis."
https://openalex.org/W3136799124,"Objective The Traumatic Injuries Distress Scale (TIDS) is a 12-item self-report tool intended for prognostic risk phenotyping in people with acute musculoskeletal (MSK) trauma. The initial validation study showed good associations with outcomes 12 weeks later in a cohort of 72 acutely injured patients from one region in Canada. This study aims to provide further clinical utility through identification of meaningful cut scores in a larger, mixed geography sample, and expands the prediction window from 12 to 52 weeks. Methods Data were drawn from databanks in London, Canada and Chicago, United States. Participants were recruited within 3 weeks of non-catastrophic MSK trauma and followed for 12 months. Using outcomes trajectories, the TIDS underwent linear regression-based analysis to predict 52-week outcomes, and area under the receiver operating characteristic curves to identify discriminative accuracy and meaningful cut scores. Results N = 224 participants with acute trauma were followed and both %Interference and Pain Severity were captured at intake and 3 follow-ups to establish curvilinear recovery trajectories. The TIDS explained significant variance in both the interference and severity outcomes after controlling for sex, region of injury, and baseline scores. ROC analysis revealed significant discriminative accuracy for predicting both the trajectories and the distal outcomes over 52 weeks. The TIDS was more accurate for identifying the low-risk than high-risk patients. Conclusion The TIDS is a useful tool for ‘ruling out’ high risk of poor outcome in a mixed sample of participants from two different countries. Impact statement The TIDS will be a useful tool for clinicians to predict the rate of recovery by displaying meaningful cut-scores for their patients after an acute musculoskeletal injury. This could lead to reduced burden of care for low risk patients and more informed treatment options for higher risk patients."
https://openalex.org/W3137022263,"Connectivity of natural areas through biological corridors is essential for ecosystem resilience and biodiversity conservation. However, robust assessments of biodiversity in corridor areas are often hindered by logistical constraints and the statistical challenges of modeling data from multiple species. Herein, we used a hierarchical community occupancy model in a Bayesian framework to evaluate the status of medium and large-sized mammals in a critical link of the Mesoamerican Biological Corridor (MBC) in Costa Rica. We used camera traps deployed from 2013-2017 to detect 18 medium (1-15 kg) and 6 large (>15 kg) mammal species in a portion of two Jaguar Conservation Units (JCUs) and the Corridor linking them. Camera traps operated for 16,904 trap nights across 209 stations, covering an area of 880 km2. Forest cover was the most important driver of medium and large-sized mammal habitat use, with forest specialists such as jaguars (Panthera onca) and pumas (Puma concolor) strongly associated with high forest cover, while habitat generalists such as coyotes (Canis latrans) and raccoons (Procyon lotor) were associated with low forest cover. Medium and large-sized mammal species richness was lower in the Corridor area ([Formula: see text] = 9.78±1.84) than in the portions evaluated of the two JCUs ([Formula: see text] = 11.50±1.52). Puma and jaguar habitat use probabilities were strongly correlated with large prey species richness (jaguar, r = 0.59, p<0.001; puma, r = 0.72, p<0.001), and correlated to a lesser extent with medium prey species richness (jaguar, r = 0.36, p = 0.003; puma, r = 0.23, p = 0.064). Low estimated jaguar habitat use probability in one JCU (Central Volcanic Cordillera: [Formula: see text] = 0.15±0.11) suggests that this is not the jaguar stronghold previously assumed. In addition, the western half of the Corridor has low richness of large mammals, making it necessary to take urgent actions to secure habitat connectivity for mammal populations."
https://openalex.org/W3137329093,"Wearable Cognitive Assistants (WCA) are anticipated to become a widely-used application class, in conjunction with emerging network infrastructures like 5G that incorporate edge computing capabilities. While prototypical studies of such applications exist today, the relationship between infrastructure service provisioning and its implication for WCA usability is largely unexplored despite the relevance that these applications have for future networks. This paper presents an experimental study assessing how WCA users react to varying end-to-end delays induced by the application pipeline or infrastructure. Participants interacted directly with an instrumented task-guidance WCA as delays were introduced into the system in a controllable fashion. System and task state were tracked in real time, and biometric data from wearable sensors on the participants were recorded. Our results show that periods of extended system delay cause users to correspondingly (and substantially) slow down in their guided task execution, an effect that persists for a time after the system returns to a more responsive state. Furthermore, the slow-down in task execution is correlated with a personality trait, neuroticism, associated with intolerance for time delays. We show that our results implicate impaired cognitive planning, as contrasted with resource depletion or emotional arousal, as the reason for slowed user task executions under system delay. The findings have several implications for the design and operation of WCA applications as well as computational and communication infrastructure, and additionally for the development of performance analysis tools for WCA."
https://openalex.org/W3137356919,"Background The effect of alcohol on the outcome and fibrinolysis phenotype in trauma patients remains unclear. Hence, we performed this study to determine whether alcohol is a risk factor for mortality and fibrinolysis shutdown in trauma patients. Materials and methods A total of 686 patients who presented to our trauma center and underwent rotational thromboelastometry were included in the study. The primary outcome was in-hospital mortality. Logistic regression analysis was performed to determine whether alcohol was an independent risk factor for in-hospital mortality and fibrinolysis shutdown. Results The rate of in-hospital mortality was 13.8% and blood alcohol was detected in 27.7% of the patients among our study population. The patients in the alcohol-positive group had higher mortality rate, higher clotting time, and lower maximum lysis, more fibrinolysis shutdown, and hyperfibrinolysis than those in the alcohol-negative group. In logistic regression analysis, blood alcohol was independently associated with in-hospital mortality (odds ratio [OR] 2.578; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.550–4.288) and fibrinolysis shutdown (OR 1.883 [95% CI, 1.286–2.758]). Within the fibrinolysis shutdown group, blood alcohol was an independent predictor of mortality (OR 2.168 [95% CI, 1.030–4.562]). Conclusions Alcohol is an independent risk factor for mortality and fibrinolysis shutdown in trauma patients. Further, alcohol is an independent risk factor for mortality among patients who experienced fibrinolysis shutdown."
https://openalex.org/W3138770547,"Context Standard pregnancy intentions measures do not always align with how people approach pregnancy. Studies that have investigated beyond a binary framework found that those with “ambivalent” feelings towards pregnancy are less likely to use contraception consistently, but the reasons for this are unclear. We sought to gain a nuanced understanding of pregnancy desires, and how perceptions about pregnancy are associated with contraceptive use. Methods We used non-probability quota sampling based on sex, age, and geographic region for a web-based survey of heterosexual men and women, aged 21–44 years, who could become pregnant/impregnate and were not currently pregnant (n = 1,477; 51% female). The survey was created using unique items informed by recent literature. Bivariate and multivariable analyses explored relationships between various perceptions about pregnancy with pregnancy desires categorized as: wanting a pregnancy , not wanting a pregnancy , and not trying but would be okay with a pregnancy . We conducted a sub-group analysis of those who were not trying but would be okay with a pregnancy (n = 460), using descriptive statistics to examine how consistent contraceptive use was associated with emotions and beliefs about avoiding pregnancy. Results After adjustment, those who felt that pregnancy may not always be avoidable, but instead determined by fate/higher power, or a natural process that happens when it is meant to, were significantly more likely (aOR: 1.83, 95% CI: 1.05–3.36; aOR: 2.21, 95% CI: 1.29–3.76, respectively) to report not trying but being okay with pregnancy, whereas those with negative feelings about a pregnancy were less likely to feel okay about a pregnancy (aOR: 0.11, 95% CI: 0.08–0.15), versus not wanting a pregnancy. In the sub-group analysis, those who felt pregnancy was determined by fate/higher power or a natural process were more likely to report not using contraception consistently (70%, 68%, respectively). Conclusions Those who state they are not trying but would be okay with pregnancy may not use contraception consistently because of beliefs that pregnancy is predetermined. Our findings support less categorical and more multidimensional approaches to measuring fertility intentions, with important implications for reproductive health service provision."
https://openalex.org/W3138941399,"To address the unmet need of continuous IOP monitoring, a Pressure-Measuring Contact Lens (PMCL) was developed to measure IOP in millimeters of mercury (mmHg) continuously over 24 hours. The present study assessed the reliability of the novel PMCL.In this prospective open-label clinical study, healthy and open-angle glaucoma (OAG) subjects were fitted with the PMCL, and pneumatonometry was performed on study eyes (in absence of the PMCL) and on fellow eyes before, during, and after provocative tests. The primary outcome measures were (1) mean IOP difference between same-eye measurements, and (2) percentage of timepoints at which IOP measured by the PMCL was within 5 mmHg of that measured by pneumatonometry in the fellow eye.Eight subjects were analysed (4 healthy, 4 OAG). The average difference in successive IOP measurements made by pneumatonometry and with the PMCL was 2.0±4.3mmHg at placement-time, and 6.5±15.2mmHg at removal time. During water drinking test, a significant increase in IOP was detected both by PMCL in the study eye (2.4±2.5mmHg, p = 0.03) and by pneumatonometry in the fellow eye (1.9±1.9mmHg, p = 0.02). Over the 24-hour recording, 88.0% of IOP variations measured by the PMCL were within 5mmHg of that measured with the pneumatonometer in the fellow eye. A transient corneal erosion of severe intensity was observed following removal of the PMCL on one single eye, and may have affected measurement accuracy in that eye.This study is a proof-of-concept for this novel PMCL, and its results are encouraging, with a fair accuracy in IOP values measurement and good sensitivity to subtle IOP variations."
https://openalex.org/W3137159191,"Background Mobile health (mHealth) can be beneficial in monitoring the complex healthcare regimen for people with HIV that includes adhering to medication and refraining from risky practices such as unsafe sex and injection drug use. Not only is mHealth often implemented without appropriate feasibility and acceptability research, but there is limited mHealth research among key HIV-positive populations such as men who have sex with men (MSM) and transgender women (TGW). Methods This study assessed access to and use of mobile technology and acceptability of mHealth among 150 HIV-positive MSM and TGW who were prescribed antiretroviral therapy (ART) in Malaysia–an emerging economy with rapid telecommunications growth and societal stigma against these groups. Results Findings among the 114 MSM and 36 TGW reveal high levels of depression (42%), stigma (2.53/4.00) and risky sexual behavior (30%), and suboptimal ART adherence (22%). On the other hand, the sample had excellent access to smartphones (75.3%) and the internet (78%), and had high acceptance of mHealth especially for those with suboptimal ART adherence. Conclusion In settings like Malaysia where homosexuality and cross-dressing are socially and legally stigmatized, HIV prevention and treatment strategies delivered using an mHealth platform have the potential to overcome in-person barriers."

The aim of the current study was to investigate the effect of smoking on the choroidal structure in patients with CSC.The choroidal vascular index (CVI) was calculated using the binarized OCT images. Baseline parameters (age, refractive error [SE], subfoveal choroidal thickness [SFCT] and CVI) were compared between smokers and non-smokers using Wilcoxon rank sum test. Moreover, the associations between SFCT and the baseline parameters were analyzed using a multivariate linear regression followed by the AICc model selection.Among 75 CSC patients, 45 patients were smokers and 30 patients were non-smokers. No significant differences in age and SE were seen between the smoking group and the non-smoking group. A significant difference in the SFCT was seen between two groups (382.0 ± 68.2 μm in the smoking group vs. 339.3 ± 52.3 μm in the non-smoking group, p = 0.0038), while no significant difference was observed in the CVI (p = 0.32). The optimal model for SFCT included the variables of age, SE and past history of smoking among the baseline parameters. Additionally, increased pack years was associated with increased SFCT.Cigarette smoking was associated with an increased SFCT in patients with CSC. Thicker choroid in smoking CSC patients may be an important modulator of the disease."
https://openalex.org/W3137448188,"Fuzzy C-means clustering algorithm is one of the typical clustering algorithms in data mining applications. However, due to the sensitive information in the dataset, there is a risk of user privacy being leaked during the clustering process. The fuzzy C-means clustering of differential privacy protection can protect the user’s individual privacy while mining data rules, however, the decline in availability caused by data disturbances is a common problem of these algorithms. Aiming at the problem that the algorithm accuracy is reduced by randomly initializing the membership matrix of fuzzy C-means, in this paper, the maximum distance method is firstly used to determine the initial center point. Then, the gaussian value of the cluster center point is used to calculate the privacy budget allocation ratio. Additionally, Laplace noise is added to complete differential privacy protection. The experimental results demonstrate that the clustering accuracy and effectiveness of the proposed algorithm are higher than baselines under the same privacy protection intensity."
https://openalex.org/W3137460119,"Invasive plants have the potential to interfere with native species’ reproductive success through a number of mechanisms, including heterospecific pollination and hybridization. This study investigated reproductive interactions between a native North American woody vine (American bittersweet, Celastrus scandens ) and an introduced congener (oriental bittersweet, C . orbiculatus ). The decline of C . scandens in the eastern portion of its range is coincident with the introduction and spread of C . orbiculatus , and the two species are known to hybridize. The relationship between proximity and floral production of conspecific and heterospecific males on fertilization and hybridization rates was measured at a field site in northwestern Indiana, USA where both species occur and reproduce. We found that the invasive vine had an extreme advantage in both male and female floral production, producing nearly 200 times more flowers per staminate plant and 65 times more flowers per pistillate plant than the native. Using nuclear microsatellite DNA markers we found that hybridization rates were asymmetric; 39% of the C . scandens seeds tested were hybrids, compared to only 1.6% of C . orbiculatus seeds. The asymmetric hybridization rates were likely not solely due to greater abundance of C . orbiculatus pollen because experimental hand crosses revealed that C . scandens had a higher rate (41%) of heterospecific fertilization than C . orbiculatus (2.4%). We previously reported that few hybrids were observed in the wild, and hybrids had greatly reduced fecundity. Thus, in our system, the threat posed by heterospecific pollen is not replacement by hybrids or introgression, but rather asymmetric reproductive interference. Reproductive interference extended to distances as great as 100 meters, thus, efforts to conserve the native species must reduce its exposure to C . orbiculatus over a relatively large spatial scale."

We found that participants (Air Force cadets and civilian students) were less likely to make the common utilitarian choice (sacrificing one to save five), when the value of the one increased, especially in the military context. However, in the firefighter context, this decision pattern was much less pronounced.

https://openalex.org/W3136644488,"Voltage-gated potassium (Kv) channels regulate the membrane potential and conductance of excitable cells to control the firing rate and waveform of action potentials. Even though Kv channels have been intensely studied for over 70 year, surprisingly little is known about how specific channels expressed in various neurons and their functional properties impact neuronal network activity and behavior in vivo. Although many in vivo genetic manipulations of ion channels have been tried, interpretation of these results is complicated by powerful homeostatic plasticity mechanisms that act to maintain function following perturbations in excitability. To better understand how Kv channels shape network function and behavior, we have developed a novel optogenetic technology to acutely regulate Kv channel expression with light by fusing the light-sensitive LOV domain of Vaucheria frigida Aureochrome 1 to the N-terminus of the Kv1 subunit protein to make an Opto-Kv1 channel. Recording of Opto-Kv1 channels expressed in Xenopus oocytes, mammalian cells, and neurons show that blue light strongly induces the current expression of Opto-Kv1 channels in all systems tested. We also find that an Opto-Kv1 construct containing a dominant-negative pore mutation (Opto-Kv1(V400D)) can be used to down-regulate Kv1 currents in a blue light-dependent manner. Finally, to determine whether Opto-Kv1 channels can elicit light-dependent behavioral effect in vivo, we targeted Opto-Kv1 (V400D) expression to Kv1.3-expressing mitral cells of the olfactory bulb in mice. Exposure of the bulb to blue light for 2-3 hours produced a significant increase in sensitivity to novel odors after initial habituation to a similar odor, comparable to behavioral changes seen in Kv1.3 knockout animals. In summary, we have developed novel photoactivatable Kv channels that provide new ways to interrogate neural circuits in vivo and to examine the roles of normal and disease-causing mutant Kv channels in brain function and behavior."
https://openalex.org/W3137324251,"Structural variations (SVs) represent a large fraction of all genetic diversity, but how this genetic diversity is translated into phenotypic and organismal diversity is unclear. Explosive diversification of dog coat color and patterns after domestication can provide a unique opportunity to explore this question; however, the major obstacle is to efficiently collect a sufficient number of individuals with known phenotypes and genotypes of hundreds of thousands of markers. Using customer-provided information about coat color and patterns of dogs tested on a commercial canine genotyping platform, we identified a genomic region on chromosome 38 that is strongly associated with a mottled coat pattern (roaning) by genome-wide association study. We identified a putative causal variant in this region, an 11-kb tandem duplication (11,131,835-11,143,237) characterized by sequence read coverage and discordant reads of whole-genome sequence data, microarray probe intensity data, and a duplication-specific PCR assay. The tandem duplication is in an intronic region of usherin gene (USH2A), which was perfectly associated with roaning but absent in non-roaned dogs. We detected strong selection signals in this region characterized by reduced nucleotide diversity (π), increased runs of homozygosity, and extended haplotype homozygosity in Wirehaired Pointing Griffons and Australian Cattle Dogs (typically roaned breeds), as well as elevated genetic difference (FST) between Wirehaired Pointing Griffon (roaned) and Labrador Retriever (non-roaned). Surprisingly, all Dalmatians (N = 262) carried the duplication embedded in identical or similar haplotypes with roaned dogs, indicating this region as a shared target of selection during the breed's formation. We propose that the Dalmatian's unique spots were a derived coat pattern by establishing a novel epistatic interaction between roaning ""R-locus"" on chromosome 38 and an uncharacterized modifier locus. These results highlight the utility of consumer-oriented genotype and phenotype data in the discovery of genomic regions contributing to phenotypic diversity in dogs."
https://openalex.org/W3139182314,"Introduction Alcohol Use Disorders are frequently comorbid with personality disorders. However, the heterogeneity of the prevalence estimates is high, and most data come from high income countries. Our aim is to estimate the prevalence and association between alcohol use outcomes and the three DSM-5 clusters of personality disorders in a representative sample of the São Paulo Metropolitan Area. Materials and methods A representative household sample of 2,942 adults was interviewed using the WHO Composite International Diagnostic Interview and the International Personality Disorder Examination Screening Questionnaire. Lifetime PD diagnoses were multiply imputed, and AUD diagnoses were obtained using DSM-5 criteria. We conducted cross-tabulations and logistic regression to estimate the associations between AUDs and PDs. Results and discussion Our study did not find significant associations of PDs with heavy drinking patterns or mild AUD. Cluster B PD respondents tended to show the highest conditional prevalence estimates of most alcohol use patterns and AUD, including its severity subtypes. When alcohol outcomes were regressed on all PD Clusters simultaneously, with adjustment for sex and age, only cluster B was significantly associated with past-year alcohol use (OR 3.0), regular drinking (OR 3.2), and AUDs (OR 8.5), especially moderate and severe cases of alcohol use disorders (OR 9.7 and 16.6, respectively). These associations between Cluster B PDs and these alcohol outcomes were shown to be independent of other PD Clusters and individuals´ sex and age. Conclusion The main finding of our study is that AUDs are highly comorbid with PDs. The presence of Cluster B PDs significantly increases the odds of alcohol consumption and disorders and of more severe forms of AUDs. Considering the local context of poor treatment provision, more specific prevention and intervention strategies should be directed to this population."
https://openalex.org/W3139273068,"Keloid disease is hard to fully eradicate. Recurrence and other unsatisfactory results were found in many patients. No current therapeutic modality has been determined to be most effective for treating keloid scars. Intralesional corticosteroid injections is most commonly recommended for primary management of small and young keloids as well as hypertrophic scars. However, it's difficult for patients to adhere to long-term triamcinolone acetonide injection therapy because of the pain, inconvenience or complications including hormonal imbalance or irregular menstruation.We aimed to determine whether and how Strontium-90 brachytherapy as an adjuvant radiation could affect keloid recurrence after intralesional triamcinolone and 5-fluorouracil injections.We included keloid patients from March 2019 to September 2019 and randomly allocated them to two groups after 3 intralesional triamcinolone and 5-fluorouracil injections at 3 weeks interval. The experimental group received Strontium-90 brachytherapy at a total dose of 15-20Gy, while the control group didn't receive any adjuvant treatment. We performed both Vancouver Scar Scale scoring and Color Doppler ultrasound examination to monitor and evaluate lesions regularly. A one-year follow-up was completed for each patient.31 patients who had 42 keloids in total were recruited. We found intralesional triamcinolone and 5-fluorouracil injections could effectively reduce the thickness and modify the hardness of small and young keloids. Strontium-90 brachytherapy reduced the one-year recurrence rate from 85.7 percent to 44.4 percent after 3 intralesional triamcinolone and 5-fluorouracil injections. The lesions' thickness or elasticity was not affected by Strontium-90 brachytherapy.Strontium-90 brachytherapy as an adjuvant radiation could effectively reduce small sized keloids recurrence after intralesional triamcinolone and 5-fluorouracil injections. It worked by enhancing the lesions' stability post-injection.The clinical trial registration number: ChiCTR2000030141.

The genetic, epidemiological, and pathogenic characteristics are, however, little understood. In children with acute gastroenteritis, this study used next-generation sequencing to recognize unknown sources of viruses. In particular, 251 fecal samples obtained from individuals were sequenced in southern, northeastern, and northern Brazil. all samples were also analyzed using culture methods and parasitological tests to classify other enteric pathogens such as bacteria, parasites, and viruses. 1.9% of the samples tested positive for HuV, for a total of 5 positive children, with a mean age of 2 year, with three males and two females. Detailed molecular characterization of full genomes showed that Brazilian HuVs’ nucleotide divergence is less than 11%. The genetic gap between Brazilian sequences and the closest HuV reported previously, on the other hand, is 18%. The study showed that Brazilian sequences are closely related to the HuV defined in Viet Nam in 2013, further characterization based on phylogenetics. At least two divergent clades of HuV in South America were also seen in the phylogenetic study."

The role of the host immune response in development of hyperglycemia during sepsis remains unclear. We performed a retrospective analysis of critically ill adult septic patients requiring mechanical ventilation (n = 153) to study the relationship between hyperglycemia and ten markers of the host injury and immune response measured on the first day of ICU admission (baseline). We determined associations between each biomarker and: (1) glucose, insulin, and c-peptide levels at the time of biomarker collection by Pearson correlation; (2) average glucose and glycemic variability in the first two days of ICU admission by linear regression; and (3) occurrence of hyperglycemia (blood glucose>180mg/dL) by logistic regression. Results were adjusted for age, pre-existing diabetes mellitus, severity of illness, and total insulin and glucocorticoid dose. Baseline plasma levels of ST2 and procalcitonin were positively correlated with average blood glucose and glycemic variability in the first two days of ICU admission in unadjusted and adjusted analyses. Additionally, higher baseline ST2, IL-1ra, procalcitonin, and pentraxin-3 levels were associated with increased risk of hyperglycemia. Our results suggest associations between the host immune response and hyperglycemia in critically ill septic patients particularly implicating the interleukin-1 axis (IL-1ra), the interleukin-33 axis (ST2), and the host response to bacterial infections (procalcitonin, pentraxin-3)."
https://openalex.org/W3139301806,"Several studies have suggested that cognitive impairment affects taste sensitivity. However, the mechanism behind this is still unclear. In this study, we focused on short-term memory. Using senescence-accelerated mouse prone 1 (SAMP1) mice, we compared whether the effects of aging are observed earlier in taste sensitivity or short-term memory. We used 8-week-old mice as the young group, and 70- and 80-week-old mice as aged groups. Taste sensitivity was evaluated using a 48-hour two-bottle preference test, and short-term memory was evaluated using the Y-maze test. SAMP1 mice showed apparently changes in taste sensitivity at 70-weeks-old. However, the influence of aging on spontaneous alternation behavior, which is indicative of short-term memory alterations, was not observed in 70-week-old mice. At 80-weeks-old, the influence of aging was observed, and spontaneous alternation behavior was significantly decreased. This suggests that age-dependent changes in taste sensitivity occur prior to short-term memory function decline. In addition, there was no significant influence of aging on the mRNA expression of long-term potentiation-related genes in the hippocampus of 80-week-old mice. Therefore, the age-related decline of short-term memory may not affect taste sensitivity."
https://openalex.org/W3139469704,"This study aimed to capture the acceptability prior to, during and after the implementation of the first year of MDA rounds conducted under the Magude project, a malaria elimination project in southern Mozambique.This was a mixed-methods study, consisting of focus group discussions (FGDs) prior to the implementation of MDA rounds (September 2015), non-participant observations (NPOs) conducted during the MDA rounds (November 2015 -beginning of February 2016), and semi-structured interviews (SSIs) after the second round (end of February 2016). Community leaders, women in reproductive age, general members of the community, traditional healers and health professionals were recruited to capture the opinions of all representing key members of the community. A generic outline of nodes and codes was designed to analyze FGDs and SSI separately. Qualitative and quantitative NPO information was analyzed following a content analysis approach.222 participants took part in the FGDs (n = 154), and SSIs (n = 68); and 318 household visits during the MDA underwent NPOs. The community engagement campaign emerged throughout the study stages as a crucial factor for the acceptability of MDAs. Acceptability was also fostered by the community's general will to cooperate in any government-led activity that would reduce malaria burden, the appropriate behavior and knowledge of field workers, or the fact that the intervention was available free of charge to all. Absenteeism of heads of households was identified as the main barrier for the success of the campaign. The most commonly reported factors that negatively affected acceptability were the fear of adverse events, rumors of deaths, being unable to drink alcohol while taking DHAp, or the fear to take DHAp while in anti-retroviral treatment. Pregnancy testing and malaria testing were generally well accepted by the community.Magude's community generally accepted the first and second antimalarial MDA rounds, and the procedures associated to the intervention. Future implementation of antimalarial MDAs in southern Mozambique should focus on locally adapted strategies that engage the community to minimize absenteeism and refusals to the intervention."

These results provide additional insight behind electron transfers that are prevalent within multienzyme governed reactions. Electron bifurcation, in which a two-electron donor sends its electrons to two distinct acceptors, was first discovered in the Q-cycle of complex III of the electron transport chain (1Mitchell P. The protonmotive Q cycle: A general formulation.FEBS Lett. 1975; 59: 137-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar). Bifurcation couples endergonic and exergonic reactions together. The energy demand for the unfavored (endergonic) reaction is compensated by the energy gained through the highly favorable (exergonic) reaction (1Mitchell P. The protonmotive Q cycle: A general formulation.FEBS Lett. 1975; 59: 137-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar). More recently, electron bifurcation performed by flavins has been observed in several anaerobic bacteria and Archea (2Peters J.W. Miller A.-F. Jones A.K. King P.W. Adams M.W.W.

Bacteriol. 2008; 190: 843-850Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). In flavin-based electron bifurcation, the cofactor NAD(P)H reduces the flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) to the hydroquinone state, FADH−. FADH− bifurcates one electron to an acceptor with a low reduction potential (unfavored reaction) and one electron to an acceptor with a high reduction potential (favored), which compensates for the former energetic cost (4Buckel W. Thauer R.K. Flavin-based electron bifurcation, a new mechanism of biological energy coupling.Chem. Rev. 2018; 118: 3862-3886Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). For the bifurcating electron transfer flavoprotein from Acidaminococcus fermentans, EtfAB, the initial electron acceptor is an FAD in the B-subunit (β-FAD), while a neighboring FAD in the A-subunit (α-FAD) serves as the “uphill” (ΔΔV= −208 mV) electron destination. Specifically, in the catalytic reaction, NADH first reduces the hydride acceptor and bifurcating β-FAD (Fig. 1A). The two-electron reduced β-FADH− then transfers one electron to the semiquinone state of α-FAD (α-FAD•−), to form the hydroquinone (α-FADH−). This electron transfer is allowed due to a rotation of the α-FAD-containing domain (6Chowdhury N.P. Mowafy A.M. Demmer J.K. Upadhyay V. Koelzer S. Jayamani E. Kahnt J. Hornung M. Demmer U. Ermler U. Buckel W. Studies on the mechanism of electron bifurcation catalyzed by electron transferring flavoprotein (Etf) and butyryl-CoA dehydrogenase (Bcd) of Acidaminococcus fermentans.J. Biol. Chem. 2014; 289: 5145-5157Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1B). The other electron is bifurcated to a [4Fe-4S] cluster of a ferredoxin molecule. A further rotation of the α-FAD-containing domain allows one electron transfer from α-FADH− to δ-FAD of the butyryl-CoA dehydrogenase (6Chowdhury N.P. Mowafy A.M. Demmer J.K. Upadhyay V. Koelzer S.

Commun. 2017; 8: 1577Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1C). The elucidation of these steps certainly explains the path each electron takes, but the mechanistic details of these processes remain unclear. New insights into this mechanism not only expand our enzymatic understanding but also can be applied to facilitate new chemical reactions or energetic transformations. To explore this process, Sucharitakul et al. (8Sucharitakul J. Buckel W. Chaiyen P.

Chem. 2021; 296100124Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar) returned to EtfAB from A. fermentans as a test case. The authors performed extensive stopped-flow kinetics to rationalize the bifurcating mechanism underlining catalysis. They began by first analyzing the principal reduction step governed by NADH and β-FAD. The step involves two phases, fast and slow, that represent the formation of the charge-transfer complex, β-FADH−:NAD+ (fast), followed by its decay and electron transfer to α-FAD•− (slow). Intriguingly, reducing α-FAD to form the negatively charged semiquinone radical, α-FAD•−, took place both intra- and intermolecularly, in the absence of ferredoxin. In other words, β-FADH− reaches out to additional molecules of EtfAB to fulfill the bifurcation process for both electrons when a physiological acceptor is not available. A further experiment in the presence of butyryl-CoA dehydrogenase and ferredoxin showed a turnover number of EtfAB comparable with that determined in a kinetic simulation of the reduction of β-FAD in presence of α-FAD•−, confirming that the α-FADH− form is responsible for the electron transfer to butyryl-CoA dehydrogenase (Fig. 1). Sucharitakul et al. (8Sucharitakul J. Buckel W. Chaiyen P. Rapid kinetics reveal surprising flavin chemistry in bifurcating electron transfer flavoprotein from Acidaminococcus fermentans.J. Biol. Chem. 2021; 296100124Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar) further noted a striking redox-state dependent cross talk between the two flavins. The initial phase of the β-FAD reduction was enhanced in the presence of α-FAD (compared to EtfaB, without α-FAD). By contrast, the rate of reduction for the β-FAD molecule was stalled by the presence of the α-FAD•− semiquinone, by approximately 1500-fold. Sucharitakul et al. further investigated the fast phase of the β-FAD reduction by measuring kinetic isotope effects (KIEs). By using deuterated NADH (NADD), the authors determined a KIE of 2.1 for the β-FAD reduction in the presence of the oxidized α-FAD. Moreover, the KIE was only detectable for the reduction step and not the interflavin electron transfer. This effect was not surprising because the larger atomic weight of the deuterium is generally expected to slow down the reaction rates. The surprise came when the authors measured the KIE for the β-FAD reduction in the presence of α-FAD•−. While it was confirmed that α-FAD•− restricts the rate of reduction overall, NADD reduced β-FAD more quickly than NADH. This inverted KIE is definitively unusual, indicating that electron bifurcation must be governed by unique rules. In light of such a puzzling behavior, Sucharitakul et al. sought to verify whether the radical, or the negative charge, component of the α-FAD•− semiquinone thwarted β-FAD reduction. Since α-FAD possesses a higher two-electron reduction potential than β-FAD, they were able to prepare “half-reduced” EftAB, possessing β-FAD, and the fully reduced α-FADH−, using dithionite-based titrations. They showed that the rate of reduction was similar to that observed with oxidized α-FAD bound. Additionally, the rates were equivalent regardless of whether dithionite or excess NADH was used to generate α-FADH−. Therefore, the authors unequivocally demonstrated that the inherent characteristics of the radical, not the charge, of the α-FAD•− semiquinone impede the reduction of β-FAD. This study provides a striking example of the redox chemistry of a bifurcating electron-transfer flavoprotein, in which the radical form of the downstream flavin (the α-FAD) modulates the reactivity of the upstream flavin (the β-FAD). It would not seem that it is a long-range electrostatic effect because the negatively charged fully reduced α-FADH− does not exert this effect. As usual, good work raises more questions than answers. What is the molecular and electronic mechanism underlying such an effect? Is the radical state affecting the domain orientation? If yes, how? Or is it a matter of the protein matrix functioning as an electron conduit that functionally couples the redox and kinetic properties of the two flavins when one of them is in the radical state? Is the observed intermolecular electron transfer between EftAB proteins physiologically relevant? The excellent manuscript by Sucharitakul et al. (8Sucharitakul J. Buckel W. Chaiyen P.

A total of 43 patients were included. Tumor regression pattern after PBT were examined on the basis of follow-up duration. The variables were compared between patients with and without early tumor regression (ETR).The median follow-up duration was 40 months (range, 9-62 months). The cumulative overall survival rate at 6 months, 1 years and 5 years was 100%, 88.4%, 63.4%, respectively. Child-Pugh class A, local tumor control (LTC), complete response (CR), and ETR were significantly associated with overall survival (p < 0.05 each). Of 43 patients, 25 patients (58.1%) reached CR in the PBT-irradiated region. Twelve patients (27.9%) had a partial response and 3 patients (7.0%) had a stationary disease. Three patients (7.0%) developed in-field progression. The LTC rate at 5 years was 93.0%. Of the 25 patients who achieved a CR in the PBT-irradiated region, the median time to CR was 5 months (range, 1-19 months). Twenty-two patients (51.2%) showed ETR of the HCC, while 21 patients (48.8%) showed non-ETR. A significant association was observed between ETR and CR of the HCC after PBT (p < 0.001).The post-PBT MRI follow-up at 3 months is helpful for monitoring therapeutic response. ETR of the HCC predicted a higher rate of CR and was associated with overall survival, which provides more accurate clinical management."

The present studies characterize the effects of repetitive in vivo manual loads on porcine intervertebral disc cell metabolism using RNA deep sequencing. A single session of repetitive manual loading applied to the lumbar spine induced both up- and down-regulation of a variety of genes transcribed by cells in the ventral annuli fibrosi. The effect of manual therapy at the level of loading was greater than at a level distant to the applied load. Gene ontology and molecular pathway analyses categorized biological, molecular, and cellular functions influenced by repetitive manual loading, with over-representation of membrane, transmembrane, and pericellular activities. Weighted Gene Co-expression Network Analysis discerned enrichment in genes in pathways of inflammation and skeletogenesis. The present studies support previous findings of intervertebral disc cell mechanotransduction, and are the first to report comprehensively on the repertoire of gene targets influenced by mechanical loads associated with manual therapy interventions. The present study defines the cellular response of repeated, low-amplitude loads on normal healthy annuli fibrosi and lays the foundation for future work defining how healthy and diseased intervertebral discs respond to single or low-frequency manual loads typical of those applied clinically."

https://openalex.org/W3136340418,"In this study, a key issue to be addressed is the safe disposal of hybridoma instability. Hybridoma technology was used to produce anti-O. viverrini monoclonal antibody. Previous studies have shown that antibody production via antibody phage display can sustain the hybridoma technique. This paper presents the utility of antibody phage display technology for producing the phage displayed KKU505 Fab fragment and using experiments in concomitant with molecular simulation for characterization. The phage displayed KKU505 Fab fragment and characterization were successfully carried out. The KKU505 hybridoma cell line producing anti-O. viverrini antibody predicted to bind to myosin was used to synthesize cDNA so as to amplify the heavy chain and the light chain sequences. The KKU505 displayed phage was constructed and characterized by a molecular modeling in which the KKU505 Fab fragment and -O. viverrini myosin head were docked computationally and it is assumed that the Fab fragment was specific to -O. viverrini on the basis of mass spectrometry and Western blot. This complex interaction was confirmed by molecular simulation. Furthermore, the KKU505 displayed phage was validated using indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) and immunohistochemistry. It is worthy to note that ELISA and immunohistochemistry results confirmed that the Fab fragment was specific to the -O. viverrini antigen. Results indicated that the approach presented herein can generate anti-O. viverrini antibody via the phage display technology. This study integrates the use of phage display technology together with molecular simulation for further development of monoclonal antibody production. Furthermore, the presented work has profound implications for antibody production, particularly by solving the problem of hybridoma stability issues."
