https://openalex.org/W2883697525,"Cas9-induced double stranded breaks can cause large deletions near the target site and more complex genomic rearrangements in mouse and human stem cells. CRISPR–Cas9 is poised to become the gene editing tool of choice in clinical contexts. Thus far, exploration of Cas9-induced genetic alterations has been limited to the immediate vicinity of the target site and distal off-target sequences, leading to the conclusion that CRISPR–Cas9 was reasonably specific. Here we report significant on-target mutagenesis, such as large deletions and more complex genomic rearrangements at the targeted sites in mouse embryonic stem cells, mouse hematopoietic progenitors and a human differentiated cell line. Using long-read sequencing and long-range PCR genotyping, we show that DNA breaks introduced by single-guide RNA/Cas9 frequently resolved into deletions extending over many kilobases. Furthermore, lesions distal to the cut site and crossover events were identified. The observed genomic damage in mitotically active cells caused by CRISPR–Cas9 editing may have pathogenic consequences."

https://openalex.org/W2883688299,"RNA-seq is increasingly used for quantitative profiling of small RNAs (for example, microRNAs, piRNAs and snoRNAs) in diverse sample types, including isolated cells, tissues and cell-free biofluids. The accuracy and reproducibility of the currently used small RNA-seq library preparation methods have not been systematically tested. Here we report results obtained by a consortium of nine labs that independently sequenced reference, 'ground truth' samples of synthetic small RNAs and human plasma-derived RNA. We assessed three commercially available library preparation methods that use adapters of defined sequence and six methods using adapters with degenerate bases. Both protocol- and sequence-specific biases were identified, including biases that reduced the ability of small RNA-seq to accurately measure adenosine-to-inosine editing in microRNAs. We found that these biases were mitigated by library preparation methods that incorporate adapters with degenerate bases. MicroRNA relative quantification between samples using small RNA-seq was accurate and reproducible across laboratories and methods."

https://openalex.org/W2890210379,"Breast cancer stem cells (BCSCs), a small subset of breast cancer cells with stem cell–like properties, are essential in tumor formation, metastasis, resistance to anticancer therapies, and cancer recurrence. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are involved in tumorigenicity by regulating specific oncogenes and tumor-suppressor genes, and their roles in BCSCs are becoming apparent. A novel, 3-dimensional (3D), semisolid culture system was established to culture MCF-7 spheroid cells with high percentage of BCSCs. The differences in miRNA expression among the MCF-7 parental cells, BCSC-enriched MCF-7 spheroid cells, and CD44+/CD24− MCF-7 cells were evaluated by miRNA microarray, and the high expression of miR-210 in MCF-7 spheroid cells and CD44+/CD24− MCF-7 cells was verified by quantitative RT-PCR. MCF-7 cells were cultured in a hypoxic chamber to detect the effect of hypoxia on miR-210 expression and the sternness of the cells. The 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide (MTT), transwell, and sphere-formation assays were performed to detect the proliferation, migration, and self-renewal ability of miR-210– overexpressed MCF-7 cells and MCF-7 spheroid cells with miR-210 knocked down. The target of miR-210 was validated with a dual-luciferase reporter assay and Western blotting. In vivo xenograft assay and metastasis assay were performed to study the effects of miR-210 targeting E-cadherin on BCSCs growth and lung metastasis, and the tumors were assessed by immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence. We developed a novel 3D, semisolid culture system to culture MCF-7 spheroid cells, which are enriched in BCSCs, and found, by performing miRNAs expression profiling, miR-210 was up-regulated in those cells compared with MCF-7 parental cells. High miR-210 expression was also detected in CD44+/CD24− MCF-7 cells and human CD44+/CD24− breast cancer cells, which was demonstrated to be partially due to the hypoxic microenvironment around BCSCs in MCF-7 spheroids or solid tumors. Ectopic expression of miR-210 in MCF-7 cells promoted their migration, invasion, proliferation, and selfrenewal in both in vitro and in vivo studies. We further reported that miR-210 suppressed E-cadherin expression by targeting the open reading frame region of E-cadherin mRNA and by up-regulation of E-cadherin transcription repressor, Snail. Accordingly, E-cadherin overexpression compromises the migration, invasion, proliferation, and self-renewal ability of miR-210–overexpressed MCF-7 both in vitro and in vivo. These findings reveal a novel regulatory pathway centered on hypoxia-mediated miR-210 targeting of E-cadherin, which contributes to the properties and breast tumorigenesis of BCSCs.—Tang, T., Yang, Z., Zhu, Q., Wu, Y., Sun, K., Alahdal, M., Zhang, Y., Xing, Y., Shen, Y., Xia, T., Xi, T., Pan, Y., Jin, L.

https://openalex.org/W2889991839,"Klebsiella pneumoniae (KP) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA) are important human pathogens that are associated with a range of infection types, including wound and disseminated infections. Treatment has been complicated by rising rates of antimicrobial resistance. Immunoprophylactic strategies are not constrained by antimicrobial resistance mechanisms. Vaccines against these organisms would be important public health tools, yet they are not available. KP surface O polysaccharides (OPS) are protective antigens in animal models of infection. Similarly, PA flagellin (Fla), the major subunit of the flagellar filament, is required for virulence and is a target of protective antibodies in animal models. We report herein the development of a combined KP and PA glycoconjugate vaccine comprised of the four most common KP OPS types associated with human infections (O1, O2, O3, O5), chemically linked to the two Fla types of PA (FlaA, FlaB). Conjugation of KP OPS to PA Fla enhanced anti-polysaccharide immune responses and produced a formulation that generated antibody titers to the four KP OPS types and both PA Fla antigens in rabbits. Passive transfer of vaccine-induced rabbit antisera reduced the bacterial burden and protected mice against fatal intravenous KP infection. Mice passively transferred with conjugate-induced antisera were also protected against PA infection after thermal injury with a FlaB-expressing isolate, but not a FlaA isolate. Taken together, these promising preclinical results provide important proof-of-concept for a broad spectrum human vaccine to prevent KP and PA infections."
https://openalex.org/W2889905864,"Previously, we reported that elevated serum levels of heat shock protein 27 (HSP27) are predictive of a lower risk of having a heart attack, stroke, or death from cardiovascular disease. Moreover, augmenting HSP27 (or the murine ortholog, HSP25) attenuated experimental atherogenesis, reduced inflammation, and lowered cholesterol levels. Recently, we noted that HSP27 activates NF-κB via TLR-4, resulting in attenuation of plaque inflammation; however, the precise anti-atherosclerosis mechanisms mediated by extracellular HSP27 are incompletely understood. Our purpose in this study was to investigate the existence of HSP27 in extracellular vesicles (EVs) and whether HSP27 elicited atheroprotective effects on target cells. Here, we provide evidence that HSP27 localizes to EVs derived from THP-1 cells using transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and immunogold labeling, Western blotting, ELISA, and fluorescence-activated cell sorting. TEM imaging indicated that HSP27 is found at the exosomal membrane. Multiple reactor monitor-mass spectrometric analysis of large vesicles, which included microparticles and exosomes, isolated from human plasma, also led to detection of HSP27 using the unique signature peptide, R.LFDQAFGLPR.L. Studies using THP-1 and human embryonic kidney cells show that HSP27-laden exosomes significantly stimulated NF-κB activation ( P < 0.001) and release of IL-10 ( P < 0.0001), suggesting that HSP27 may be important exosomal cargo with beneficial anti-inflammatory effects.-Shi, C., Ulke-Lemee, A., Deng, J., Batulan, Z., O'Brien, E.

https://openalex.org/W2890295515,"The emergence of carbapenem resistant Escherichia coli represents a serious public health concern. This study investigated the resistome, virulence, plasmids content and clonality of 27 carbapenem resistant E. coli isolated from 27 hospitalized patients at the American University of Beirut Medical Center (AUBMC) in Lebanon between 2012 and 2016. Whole-genome sequencing (WGS) data were used to identify resistance determinants. Multilocus sequence typing (MLST), pulsed field gel electrophoresis (PFGE), phylogenetic grouping and PCR-based replicon typing (PBRT) were also performed. The 27 isolates were distributed into 15 STs, of which ST405 (14.8%; n = 4) was the most prevalent. All of the 27 isolates were carbapenem resistant and 20 (74%) were extended-spectrum β-lactamase (ESBL) gene carriers. The predominant detected carbapenemases were blaOXA-48 (48.1%; n = 13) and blaOXA-181 (7.4%; n = 2), for the ESBLs it was blaCTX-M-15 (55.6%; n = 15) and blaCTX-M-24 (18.5%; n = 5), and for the AmpC-type β–lactamases, blaCMY-42 (40.7%; n = 11) and blaCMY-2 (3.7%; n = 1). Thirteen replicons were identified among the 27 E. coli isolates including: IncL/M, IncFIA, IncFIB, IncFII, IncI1, and IncX3. PFGE revealed a high genetic diversity with the 27 isolates being grouped in 21 different pulsotypes. SNPs analysis and PFGE showed a possible clonal dissemination of ST405, ST1284, ST354 and ST410 and the dominance of certain STs, monitoring of which could help in elucidating routes of transmission. This study represents the first WGS-based in depth analysis of the resistomes and mobilomes of carbapenem resistant E. coli in Lebanon."
https://openalex.org/W2890803748,"The purpose of this study was to compare the performance of two different models of smartphone and a conventional camera with that of direct clinical examination in detecting caries lesions at different stages of progression in deciduous molars. The photographic equipment consisted of two smartphones (iPhone and Nexus 4) and a conventional macro camera setup. First, in the laboratory phase of the study, we compared the images of 20 exfoliated primary teeth having caries lesions at different stages. Then, in the clinical phase of the study, the images of 119 primary molars from fifteen children (3 to 6 years old) were used. All of the photographic images were taken using the previously described devices. In both groups, two examiners, blinded to the photographic equipment used, assessed the images independently on a computer screen, and classified them according to the International Caries Detection and Assessment System (ICDAS). The teeth were then examined directly by two other experienced examiners, and the consensus reached was considered the reference standard. Parameters of validity, such as percentage of correct answers, agreement with the reference standard, sensitivity, specificity and inter-examiner agreement (using the weighted kappa test) were calculated. The examiners performed similarly in both in vitro and in vivo studies. Inter-examiner reliability was approximately 0.7 for all the devices in the laboratory setting, and for the macro camera photography system in the clinical setting, but it was approximately 0.9 for the iPhone and Nexus images taken in vivo. With regard to the percentage of correct answers, the highest values were observed for sound and extensive caries lesions in both laboratory and clinical settings. The percentage of correct answers for initial and moderate lesions was particularly low in the clinical evaluation, irrespective of the camera devices used. Therefore, we concluded that photographic diagnosis using smartphone images is feasible and accurate for distinguishing sound tooth surfaces from extensive caries lesions; however, photographic images are not a good method for accurately detecting initial and moderate caries lesions."
https://openalex.org/W2889927242,"Driving style is an important factor in driving psychology, which is useful for effectively evaluating driving behaviors. Exploring driving style in a Chinese sample could help understand the overall situation of Chinese drivers. This study aims to develop a measurement of driving style fit for the Chinese situation and to validate the validity and reliability of this scale. In this study, 296 drivers from China completed the Chinese version of the multidimensional driving style inventory (MDSI), the Big Five Inventory (BFI), and the Driver Behavior Questionnaire (DBQ) as well as several questions about socio-demographic information. After testing the assumed structure by a confirmatory factor analysis, and adjusting the structure, a brief version of Chinese version of MDSI with twelve items categorized into four driving styles, namely, risky style, angry- high-velocity style, careful style and anxious style was revised. The validity and reliability of the scales were acceptable. The results showed that driving styles were closely correlated with self-reported driving behaviors. Specifically, risky style, angry- high-velocity style, and anxious style are all positively associated with dangerous driving behaviors. Meanwhile, careful style was positively associated with positive driving behaviors and negatively correlated with dangerous driving behaviors. Anxious was also found to be negatively associated with fines. For personality, we found a positive relationship between risky, angry- high-velocity, careful and anxious styles and the personality traits that often have negative effects on driving, such as extraversion and neuroticism. Meanwhile, these three styles were negatively correlated with conscientiousness and agreeableness in general. In addition, careful style was positively correlated with conscientiousness and agreeableness. The current study shows convincing evidence for the validity and reliability of the brief MDSI-C and develops a useful tool for identify the driving style of Chinese drivers for future research and relevant departments of road safety."
https://openalex.org/W2892182810,"Advances in recent years have made molecular dynamics (MD) and Monte Carlo (MC) simulations powerful tools in molecular-level research, allowing the prediction of experimental observables in the study of systems such as proteins, membranes, and polymeric materials. However, the quality of any prediction based on molecular dynamics results will strongly depend on the validity of underlying physical assumptions. Unphysical behavior of simulations can have significant influence on the results and reproducibility of these simulations, such as folding of proteins and DNA or properties of lipid bilayers determined by cutoff treatment, dynamics of peptides and polymers affected by the choice of thermostat, or liquid properties depending on the simulation time step. Motivated by such examples, we propose a two-fold approach to increase the robustness of molecular simulations. The first part of this approach involves tests which can be performed by the users of MD programs on their respective systems and setups. We present a number of tests of different complexity, ranging from simple post-processing analysis to more involved tests requiring additional simulations. These tests are shown to significantly increase the reliability of MD simulations by catching a number of common simulation errors violating physical assumptions, such as non-conservative integrators, deviations from the Boltzmann ensemble, and lack of ergodicity between degrees of freedom. To make the usage as easy as possible, we have developed an open-source and platform-independent Python library (https://physical-validation.readthedocs.io) implementing these tests. The second part of the approach involves testing for code correctness. While unphysical behavior can be due to poor or incompatible choices of parameters by the user, it can just as well originate in coding errors within the program. We therefore propose to include physical validation tests in the code-checking mechanism of MD software packages. We have implemented such a validation for the GROMACS software package, ensuring that every major release passes a number of physical sanity checks performed on selected representative systems before shipping. It is, to our knowledge, the first major molecular mechanics software package to run such validation routinely. The tests are, as the rest of the package, open source software, and can be adapted for other software packages."
https://openalex.org/W2890335646,"Sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) is involved in the regulation of important cellular processes, including immune-cell trafficking and proliferation. Altered S1P signaling is strongly associated with inflammation, cancer progression, and atherosclerosis; however, the mechanisms underlying its pathophysiologic effects are only partially understood. This study evaluated the effects of S1P in vitro and in vivo on the biosynthesis of leukotrienes (LTs), which form a class of lipid mediators involved in the pathogenesis of inflammatory diseases. Here, we report for the first time that S1P potently suppresses LT biosynthesis in Ca2+-ionophore-stimulated intact human neutrophils. S1P treatment resulted in intracellular Ca2+ mobilization, perinuclear translocation, and finally irreversible suicide inactivation of the LT biosynthesis key enzyme 5-lipoxygenase (5-LO). Agonist studies and S1P receptor mRNA expression analysis provided evidence for a S1P receptor 4-mediated effect, which was confirmed by a functional knockout of S1P4 in HL60 cells. Systemic administration of S1P in wild-type mice decreased both macrophage and neutrophil migration in the lungs in response to LPS and significantly attenuated 5-LO product formation, whereas these effects were abrogated in 5-LO or S1P4 knockout mice. In summary, targeting the 5-LO pathway is an important mechanism to explain S1P-mediated pathophysiologic effects. Furthermore, agonism at S1P4 represents a novel effective strategy in pharmacotherapy of inflammation.-Fettel, J., Kühn, B., Guillen, N.

https://openalex.org/W2890443700,"Parkinson’s disease is characterized by neurodegeneration of the dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta. The 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) rat model has been used to study neurodegeneration in the nigro-striatal dopaminergic system. The goal of this study was to evaluate the reliability of diffusion MRI and resting-state functional MRI biomarkers in monitoring neurodegeneration in the 6-OHDA rat model assessed by quantitative histology. We performed a unilateral injection of 6-OHDA in the striatum of Sprague Dawley rats to produce retrograde degeneration of the dopamine neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta. We carried out a longitudinal study with a multi-modal approach combining structural and functional MRI together with quantitative histological validation to follow the effects of the lesion. Functional and structural connectivity were assessed in the brain of 6-OHDA rats and sham rats (NaCl injection) at 3 and 6 weeks post-lesioning using resting-state functional MRI and diffusion-weighted. Our results showed (i) increased functional connectivity in ipsi- and contra-lesioned regions of the cortico-basal ganglia network pathway including the motor cortex, the globus pallidus, and the striatum regions at 3 weeks; (ii) increased fractional anisotropy (FA) in the ipsi- and contralateral striatum of the 6-OHDA group at 3 weeks, and increased axial diffusivity (AD) and mean diffusivity in the ipsilateral striatum at 6 weeks; (iii) a trend for increased FA in both substantia nigra of the 6-OHDA group at 3 weeks. Optical density measurements of tyrosine-hydroxylase (TH) staining of the striatum showed good correlations with the FA and AD measurements in the striatum. No correlations were found between the number of TH-stained dopaminergic neurons and MRI measurements in the substantia nigra. This study suggested that (i) FA and AD were reliable biomarkers to evaluate neurodegeneration in the cortico-basal ganglia network of the 6-OHDA model, (ii) diffusion MRI and resting-state functional MRI (rsfMRI) were not sensitive enough to detect changes in the substantia nigra in this model."
https://openalex.org/W2891569702,"Bone remodeling occurs via coupling between bone resorption by osteoclasts and bone formation by osteoblasts. The mechanisms that regulate osteoclast signals to osteoblasts are not well understood. Published studies have reported that BMP signaling in osteoclasts regulate osteoclast coupling targets. To investigate the necessity of canonical BMP signaling on osteoclast differentiation and coupling, we mated Smad1fl/fl; Smad5fl/fl mice to c-Fms-Cre mice. We analyzed male mice at 3 months of age to determine the skeletal phenotype of the Smad1fl/fl; Smad5fl/fl;c-Fms-Cre (SMAD1/5 cKO) mice. There was a 1.2-fold decrease in trabecular BV/TV in SMAD1/5 cKO. Analyses of osteoclast serum markers in SMAD1/5 cKO mice, showed a significant increase in CTX-1 (1.5 fold) and TRAP ELISA (3 fold) compared to control mice. In these same mice, there was a 1.3-fold increase in cortical thickness. Consistent with the increase in cortical thickness, we found a 3-fold increase in osteoblast activity as measured by P1NIP ELISA assay from SMAD1/5 cKO mice. To explain the changes in cortical thickness and P1NP activity, we determined conditioned media from SMAD1/5 cKO osteoclast cultures enhanced mineralization of an osteoblast cell line and coupling factors expressed by osteoclasts that regulate osteoblast activity Wnt1 (4.5-fold increase), Gja1 (3-fold increase) and Sphk1 (1.5-fold increase) were all upregulated in osteoclasts from SMAD1/5 cKO compared to control osteoclasts. Lastly osteoclasts treated with dorsomorphin, a chemical inhibitor of SMAD1/5 signaling, demonstrates an increase in Wnt1 and Gja1 expression similar to the SMAD1/5 cKO mice. Previous studies demonstrated that TGF-β signaling in osteoclasts leads to increases in WNT1 expression by osteoclasts. Therefore, our data suggest that TGF-β and BMP signaling pathways in osteoclasts could act in an antagonistic fashion to regulate osteoblast activity through WNT1 and other coupling factors."
https://openalex.org/W2891350918,"Human activities are exposing organisms not only to direct threats (e.g. habitat loss) but also to indirect environmental pressures such as climate change, which involves not just directional global warming but also increasing climatic variability. Such changes will impact whole communities of organisms and the possible effects on population dynamics have raised concerns about increased extinction rates. Conservation-minded approaches to extinction risk vary from range shifts predicted by climate envelope models with no population dynamics to population viability analyses that ignore environmental variability altogether. Our modelling study shows that these extremes are modelling responses to a spectrum of environmental sensitivity that organisms may exhibit. We show how the survival curve plays a major role in how environmental variability leads to population fluctuations. While it is often supposed that low-fecundity organisms (those with high parental investment) will be the most vulnerable to climate change, it is those with high fecundity (low parental investment) that are likely to be more sensitive to such changes. We also find that abundance variations in high fecundity populations is driven primarily by fluctuations in the survival of early life stages, the more so if those environmental changes are autocorrelated in time. We show which types of conservation actions are most appropriate for a number of real populations. While the most effective conservation actions for organisms of low fecundity is to avoid killing them, for populations with high fecundity (and low parental investment), our study suggests conservation should focus more on protecting early life stages from hostile environments."

In this study, four types of failure were defined as the composite endpoint. When any one of the following failures occurred: 1) Death within 30 days from the start of VCM therapy, 2) Positive blood culture 7 days after the start of VCM therapy, 3) Change of VCM to another anti-MRSA agent, and 4) Development of nephrotoxicity, we considered that VCM treatment had failed. Survival time analysis was conducted with the Kaplan-Meier method and Cox's proportional hazard model that included seven predefined parameters: pharmacist intervention, age, sex, weight, baseline VCM trough concentration, Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI), and Pitt Bacteremia score (PBS). The effect of pharmacist intervention was studied as the survival probability estimated from the period of time from the start of VCM administration to the earliest failure.The survival rate at 30 days after starting VCM therapy, at the end of follow-up, was 53.1 and 82.1% in the non-intervention and intervention groups, respectively. A significant survival time prolongation was noted in the intervention group (p = 0.011, log rank test). Among the seven parameters, only pharmacist intervention was significantly different and its hazard ratio was 0.26 (p = 0.014). The survival probability of the intervention group was higher than that of the non-intervention group for the time to each failure. In subgroup analyses, a significant difference was noted in male patients between the intervention and non-intervention groups (p = 0.005). Age was categorized into those under and over 65 years old. For those over 65 years old, a significant difference was shown between the groups (p = 0.018).To our knowledge, this is the first study to evaluate the failure of VCM treatment based on the composite endpoint. Pharmacist intervention through the initial VCM dose planning could maintain a balance between the efficacy and safety of VCM treatment and might avoid treatment failure for patients with MRSA bacteremia. Further investigations with large sample sizes are required to confirm our findings."
https://openalex.org/W2891440185,"The 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmc) is a newly identified epigenetic modification thought to be regulated by the TET family of proteins. Little information is available about how ethanol consumption may modulate 5hmC formation and alcoholic liver disease (ALD) progression. A rat ALD model was used to study 5hmC in relationship to hepatocyte apoptosis. Human ALD liver samples were also used to validate these findings. It was found that chronic ethanol feeding significantly reduced 5hmC formation in a rat ALD model. There were no significant changes in TET2 and TET3 between the control- and ethanol-fed animals. In contrast, methylcytosine dioxygenase TET1 (TET1) expression was substantially reduced in the ethanol-fed rats and was accompanied by increased hepatocyte apoptosis. Similarly, knockdown of TET1 in human hepatocyte-like cells also significantly promoted apoptosis. Down-regulation of TET1 resulted in elevated expression of the DNA damage marker, suggesting a role for 5hmc in hepatocyte DNA damage as well. Mechanistic studies revealed that inhibition of TET1 promoted apoptotic gene expression. Similarly, targeting TET1 activity by removing cosubstrate promoted apoptosis and DNA damage. Furthermore, treatment with 5-azacitidine significantly mimics these effects, suggesting that chronic ethanol consumption promotes hepatocyte apoptosis and DNA damage by diminishing TETl-mediated 5hmC formation and DNA methylation. In summary, the current study provides a novel molecular insight that TETl-mediated 5hmC is involved in hepatocyte apoptosis in ALD progression.—Ji, C., Nagaoka, K., Zou, J., Casulli, S., Lu, S., Cao, K.

The aim of the present study was to investigate the contribution of A-fiber nociceptors to this increased pinprick sensitivity. For this we assessed if the perception and brain responses elicited by low-intensity intra-epidermal electrical stimulation (IES), a method preferentially activating Aδ-fiber nociceptors, are increased in the area of HFS-induced increased pinprick sensitivity. HFS was delivered to one of the two forearms of seventeen healthy volunteers. Mechanical pinprick stimulation and IES were delivered at both arms before HFS (T0), 20 minutes after HFS (T1) and 45 minutes after HFS (T2). In all participants, HFS induced an increase in pinprick perception at the HFS-treated arm, adjacent to the site of HFS. This increase was significant at both T1 and T2. HFS did not affect the percept elicited by IES, but did enhance the magnitude of the N2 wave of IES-evoked brain potentials, both at T1 and at T2. Our results show that HFS induces a long-lasting enhancement of the N2 wave elicited by IES in the area of secondary hyperalgesia, indicating that HFS enhances the responsiveness of the central nervous system to nociceptive A-fiber input. However, we found no evidence that HFS affects the perception elicited by IES, which may suggest that the population of nociceptors that mediate the perception elicited by IES do not contribute to HFS-induced increased pinprick sensitivity."

Similarly, turnover is high for trophic interactions between herbivorous insects and their host plants. Two factors have been proposed to explain temporal or spatial differences in trophic interactions: changes in species composition and temporal changes in the behavior of shared species. The goal of this study was to evaluate determinants of high β diversity of trophic interactions between lepidopteran caterpillars and their host plants across dry and rainy seasons and their transitions. Over the course of a year, interaction diversity data were collected from 275 temporary plots in Cerrado vegetation, comprising 257 species of caterpillars, 137 species of host plants and 503 different trophic interactions. All these diversity parameters varied across seasons. Species assemblages of caterpillars and plants were different among the four seasons, and there was a high turnover of interactions between the seasons. The high temporal β diversity of trophic interactions was mostly due to interaction rewiring between co-occurring species, as opposed to changes in species composition over time."
https://openalex.org/W2889798256,"Objectives Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is a devastating motor neuron disorder caused by homozygous loss of the survival motor neuron 1 (SMN1) gene and insufficient functional SMN protein produced by the SMN2 copy gene. Additional genetic protective modifiers such as Plastin 3 (PLS3) can counteract SMA pathology despite insufficient SMN protein. Recently, Spinraza, an SMN antisense oligonucleotide (ASO) that restores full-length SMN2 transcripts, has been FDA- and EMA-approved for SMA therapy. Hence, the availability of biomarkers allowing a reliable monitoring of disease and therapy progression would be of great importance. Our objectives were (i) to analyse the feasibility of SMN and of six SMA biomarkers identified by the BforSMA study in the Taiwanese SMA mouse model, (ii) to analyse the effect of PLS3 overexpression on these biomarkers, and (iii) to assess the impact of low-dose SMN-ASO therapy on the level of SMN and the six biomarkers. Methods At P10 and P21, the level of SMN and six putative biomarkers were compared among SMA, heterozygous and wild type mice, with or without PLS3 overexpression, and with or without presymptomatic low-dose SMN-ASO subcutaneous injection. SMN levels were measured in whole blood by ECL immunoassay and of six SMA putative biomarkers, namely Cartilage Oligomeric Matrix Protein (COMP), Dipeptidyl Peptidase 4 (DPP4), Tetranectin (C-type Lectin Family 3 Member B, CLEC3B), Osteopontin (Secreted Phosphoprotein 1, SPP1), Vitronectin (VTN) and Fetuin A (Alpha 2-HS Glycoprotein, AHSG) in plasma. Results SMN levels were significantly discernible between SMA, heterozygous and wild type mice. However, no significant differences were measured upon low-dose SMN-ASO treatment compared to untreated animals. Of the six biomarkers, only COMP and DPP4 showed high and SPP1 moderate correlation with the SMA phenotype. PLS3 overexpression neither influenced the SMN level nor the six biomarkers, supporting the hypothesis that PLS3 acts as an independent protective modifier."
https://openalex.org/W2890221295,"Purpose Histogram analysis is an emergent imaging technique to further analyze radiological images and to obtain imaging biomarker. In head and neck cancer, MRI and PET are routinely used in clinical practice. The aim of this study was to analyze associations between histogram based ADC parameters and complex FDG-PET derived parameters in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). Methods 34 patients (26% female, mean age, 56.7 ± 10.2 years) with primary HNSCC were prospectively included into the study. ADC histogram parameters were calculated by inhouse made matlab software using a whole lesion measurement. For each tumor, maximum and mean standardized uptake values (SUVmax, SUVmean), Total Lesion Glycolysis (TLG) and Metabolic Tumor Volume (MTV) were determined on PET-images. Spearman's correlation coefficient (ρ) was used to analyze associations between investigated parameters. Benjamini-Hochberg correction was used to adjust for multiple testing. Mann-Whitney test was used for group discrimination. P-values < 0.05 were taken to indicate statistical significance. Results The correlation analysis in the whole tumor group revealed a statistically significant correlation between entropy and MTV as well as TLG (ρ = 0.67, P<0.0001 and ρ = 0.61, P = 0.0002 respectively). There were statistically significant differences between T1/2 and T3/4 tumors in the following parameters: entropy (2.07 ± 0.36 vs 2.61 ± 0.43, P = 0.007), SUVmax (10.79 ± 4.13 vs 17.93 ± 5.89, P = 0.007), SUVmean (6.39 ± 2.48 vs 9.81 ± 4.49, P = 0.01), SUVmin (4.09 ± 1.57 vs 6.34 ± 2.59, P = 0.03), MTV (9.50 ± 7.92 vs 20.36 ± 13.30, P = 0.02), TGU (55.97 ± 39.09 vs 212.3 ± 186.3, P = 0.002). Conclusion This study showed that entropy derived from ADC maps is strongly associated with MTV and TLG in HNSCC. Entropy, SUVmax, SUVmean, TLG and MTV were statistically significant higher in T3/4 tumors in comparison to T1/2 carcinomas."
https://openalex.org/W2891759495,"A cognitively intensive companion service course has been introduced to the main fall general chemistry class at Cornell University. For years 2015 and 2016, priority students (those from groups under-represented and economically disadvantaged) show respectively improvement of +0.67 and +0.51 standard deviations in final course grade compared to priority students not in the program. Non-priority students show respectively a +0.66 and +0.62 standard deviation improvement. Progressive improvement (as measured by higher than expected Final Exam scores than what would have been expected solely from a given student’s earlier Exam 1 score) demonstrates conclusively the service course’s role in the enhanced outcomes. Progressive retention (as measured by the following year fall semester’s organic chemistry exam scores compared to what would have been expected based on a given student’s general chemistry final exam score) demonstrates that, on the average, the earlier observed progressive improvement is significantly retained in a chemistry course one year later. Preliminary retention statistics suggest a significant increase in first year to second year retention. A meta analysis of results from previously reported chemistry service courses indicate that such performance gains are difficult to achieve and hence common elements of the few effective programs may be of high value to the STEM education community."
https://openalex.org/W2890436350,"Various kinetic parameters of serum CA-125 have been reported to have better correlation with outcomes for patients treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC). This study aimed to compare the available kinetic parameters of serum CA-125 in an external cohort of advanced-stage ovarian cancer. Using the cancer registry databases from the Yonsei Cancer Hospital, we retrospectively reviewed 210 patients with advanced-stage ovarian cancer, treated with NAC followed by interval debulking surgery. We compared area under the receiver-operating characteristics curves (AUCs), false negative rate, and negative predictive value (NPV) using 10 different models for optimal cytoreduction and platinum resistance. In addition, we compared incremental AUC for progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). No gross residual tumor was observed in 37.0% and residual tumors <1 cm in 82.2% of patients. No model using CA-125 kinetic parameters had an AUC higher than >0.6 for predicting optimal cytoreduction. After adjusting for age, BMI, disease stage, and histologic subtypes, all models had an AUC >0.70 for predicting platinum resistance. However, no model had a high enough NPV (highest value = 82.0%) to avoid chemotherapy futility. For survival outcomes, no model had an incremental AUC >0.70 for predicting either PFS or OS. None of the proposed serum CA-125 kinetic parameters showed high accuracy in predicting optimal cytoreduction, platinum resistance, or survival in patients receiving NAC. For advanced-stage ovarian cancer treated with NAC, there is a need to discover reliable biomarkers to better stratify patient response groups for optimal treatment decision-making."
https://openalex.org/W2890155286,"Preliminary cytotoxic analysis of sulphur containing isosteric analogues of calothrixin B identified the useful anti-tumour activity of thia/isothiacalothrixin B which necessitated it's biological evaluation in colon and lung cancer cell lines. The isothia analogues induced cytotoxicity of HCT116 in a time-dependent manner and inhibited the clonogenic survival of HCT116 and NCI-H460 cells in a dose-dependent manner comparable to the standard anti-cancer drug camptothecin. Herein employing flow cytometry, we demonstrate that isothiacalothrixin B analogues inhibited proliferation of colon cancer cells by the arrest of cells in S and G2/M phases over a period of 48 hours at a concentration of 5 μM. Our results also suggest that the cytotoxicity of thia analogues of calothrixin B is partially mediated by induction of cellular DNA strand breaks. The UV-Vis spectroscopic studies with CT-DNA revealed groove binding for calothrixin B and its thia analogues wherein subsequent in silico molecular modelling studies indicated preferential binding to the AT-rich regions of minor groove of DNA. Furthermore, thiacalothrixin B caused transcriptional activation of p21waf1/cip1 promoter and upregulation of its protein levels independent of p53. The induction of DNA damage response pathway leads to apoptosis in isothiacalothrixin B but not in thiacalothrixin B treated cells. The isothia analogues SCAB 4 induced DNA strand breaks and cell cycle arrest even after treatment for a short period (i.e., 4 hours) and the cell cycle effects were irreversible. For the first time, this study provides detailed cellular effects on the potential use of isothiacalothrixin B analogues as cytotoxic agents."
https://openalex.org/W2955945207,"The genome-wide association study of the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium identified over one hundred schizophrenia susceptibility loci. The number of non-coding variants discovered suggests that gene regulation could mediate the effect of these variants on disease. Expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) contribute to variation in levels of mRNA. Given the co-occurrence of schizophrenia and several traits not involving the central nervous system (CNS), we investigated the enrichment of schizophrenia associations among eQTLs for four non-CNS tissues: adipose tissue, epidermal tissue, lymphoblastoid cells and blood. Significant enrichment was seen in eQTLs of all tissues: adipose (β = 0.18, p = 8.8 × 10-06), epidermal (β = 0.12, p = 3.1 × 10-04), lymphoblastoid (β = 0.19, p = 6.2 × 10-08) and blood (β = 0.19, p = 6.4 × 10-06). For comparison, we looked for enrichment of association with traits of known relevance to one or more of these tissues (body mass index, height, rheumatoid arthritis, systolic blood pressure and type-II diabetes) and found that schizophrenia enrichment was of similar scale to that observed when studying diseases in the context of a more likely causal tissue. To further investigate tissue specificity, we looked for differential enrichment of eQTLs with relevant Roadmap affiliation (enhancers and promoters) and varying distance from the transcription start site. Neither factor significantly contributed to the enrichment, suggesting that this is equally distributed in tissue-specific and cross-tissue regulatory elements. Our analyses suggest that functional correlates of schizophrenia risk are prevalent in non-CNS tissues. This could be because of pleiotropy or the effectiveness of variants affecting expression in different contexts. This suggests the utility of large, single-tissue eQTL experiments to increase eQTL discovery power in the study of schizophrenia, in addition to smaller, multiple-tissue approaches. Our results conform to the notion that schizophrenia is a systemic disorder involving many tissues."
https://openalex.org/W2890353443,"The Cardiovascular Health Awareness Program (CHAP) cardiovascular risk reduction program consisted of sessions run by local volunteers in local pharmacies during which cardiovascular risk was assessed, healthy lifestyle and preventive care was promoted, and the participants were oriented to local resources to support changes in modifiable risk factors. A clustered randomized trial implemented in September 2006 across 39 communities targeting community-dwelling individuals 65 years and older showed a significant reduction in hospitalization one year after its implementation (rate ratio of 91 [95% confidence interval (CI): 86%-97%]). This study explores the impact of CHAP in the first five years.Using health administrative data housed at the Institute for Clinical Evaluative Sciences, we established a closed cohort consisting of all individuals eligible in these communities at the study onset whom we followed over time. We assessed hospitalizations and survival using a negative binomial model for count data and Cox regression to assess time to first event, accounting for the clustered design. The primary outcome was the rate of cardiovascular-related hospitalizations defined as congestive heart failure, stroke or acute myocardial infarction.Most estimates pointed to an advantage for the intervention arm, but only all-cause mortality reached statistical significance (hazard ratio [95% CI] = 0.955 [0.914-0.999]). The hospitalization cardiovascular-related hospitalization rate ratio was (0.958, 95% CI: 0.898-1.022) in favour of the intervention communities, translating to an estimated 408 averted hospitalizations over the five-year period. There was no evidence of the effect of time from start of intervention.The consistent direction of the outcomes in favour of the intervention arms suggests that CHAP likely had a meaningful impact on reducing cardiovascular-related morbidity and mortality. Given the low cost of the intervention, further development of CHAP should be pursued."

https://openalex.org/W2884258312,"A growing framework of legal and ethical requirements limit scientific and commercial evalua-tion of personal data. Typically, pseudonymization, encryption, or methods of distributed com-puting try to protect individual privacy. However, computational infrastructures still depend on human system administrators. This introduces severe security risks and has strong impact on privacy: system administrators have unlimited access to the computers that they manage in-cluding encryption keys and pseudonymization-tables. Distributed computing and data obfuscation technologies reduce but do not eliminate the risk of privacy leakage by administrators. They produce higher implementation effort and possible data quality degradation. This paper proposes the Trusted Server as an alternative approach that provides a sealed and inaccessible computational environment in a cryptographically strict sense. During operation or by direct physical access to storage media, data stored and processed inside the Trusted Server can by no means be read, manipulated or leaked, other than by brute-force. Thus, secure and privacy-compliant data processing or evaluation of plain person-related data becomes possible even from multiple sources, which want their data kept mutually secret."
https://openalex.org/W2891455056,"Throughout recent times, cybersecurity problems have occurred in various business applications. Although previous researchers proposed to cope with the occurrence of cybersecurity issues, their methods repeatedly replicated the training processes for several times to classify datasets of these problems in streaming non-stationary environments. In dynamic environments, the conventional methods possibly deteriorate the adaptive solution to prevent these issues. This research proposes a one-pass-throw-away learning using the dynamical structure of the network to solve these problems in dynamic environments. Furthermore, to speed up the computational time and to maintain a minimum space complexity for streaming data, the new concepts of learning in forms of recursive functions were introduced. The information gain-based feature selection was also applied to reduce the learning time during the training process. The experimental results signified that the proposed algorithm outperformed the others in incremental-like and online ensemble learning algorithms in terms of classification accuracy, space complexity, and computational time."
https://openalex.org/W2889862687,"Removal of cardiac implantable electronic devices (CIEDs) by manual traction during orthotopic heart transplantation (OHT) sometimes results in retained lead fragments. Moreover, abandoned leads and retained lead fragments are a contraindication for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and may be a cause of CIED infection.To eliminate complications of retained lead fragments, we completely removed residual leads using an excimer laser sheath technique during OHT. We report our clinical experience and high success rate of lead extraction using the excimer laser sheath compared with manual traction during OHT.We obtained data on 84 consecutive patients receiving OHT between August 2007 and August 2017. Thirty-nine of 84 patients had undergone CIED implantation before OHT and removal of all their leads was attempted during OHT. From 2007 to 2014, defibrillator and pacemaker leads were extracted by manual traction in all patients (N = 22). After 2015, all leads were extracted with the excimer laser sheath, and surgical assistance was prepared for the procedure (N = 17). Complete procedural success was achieved in 100% of patients in the excimer laser group and 77% of patients in the manual traction group.Extraction of abandoned leads using the excimer laser sheath system during OHT is novel and safe technique, and has a higher success rate than extraction using manual traction during OHT."

https://openalex.org/W2890540796,"We correlate chromosome 5 haplotypes and SMN2 copy number with disease expression in 42 Mennonite and 14 Amish patients with spinal muscular atrophy (SMA). A single haplotype (A1) with 1 copy of SMN2 segregated among all Amish patients. SMN1 deletions segregated on four different Mennonite haplotypes that carried 1 (M1a, M1b, M1c) or 2 (M2) copies of SMN2. DNA microsatellite and microarray data revealed structural similarities among A1, M1a, M1b, and M2. Clinical data were parsed according to both SMN1 genotype and SMN2 copy number (2 copies, n = 44; 3 copies, n = 9; or 4 copies, n = 3). No infant with 2 copies of SMN2 sat unassisted. In contrast, all 9 Mennonites with the M1a/M2 genotype (3 copies of SMN2) sat during infancy at a median age of 7 months, and 5 (56%) walked and dressed independently at median ages of 18 and 36 months, respectively. All are alive at a median age of 11 (range 2-31) years without ventilatory support. Among 13 Amish and 26 Mennonite patients with 2 copies of SMN2 who did not receive feeding or ventilatory support, A1/A1 as compared to M1a/M1a genotype was associated with earlier clinical onset (p = 0.0040) and shorter lifespan (median survival 3.9 versus 5.7 months, p = 0.0314). These phenotypic differences were not explained by variation in SMN1 deletion size or SMN2 coding sequence, which were conserved across haplotypes. Distinctive features of SMA within Plain communities provide a population-specific framework to study variations of disease expression and the impact of disease-modifying therapies administered early in life."

https://openalex.org/W2890899317,"Ex vivo cell expansion under Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) guidelines can be performed using medium additives containing human growth factors from platelets. These products can differently affect proliferation of adipose mesenchymal stromal stem cells (ASC). Qualification of medium additive performance is required for validation under GMP regulations: assessment of growth factor concentrations is not sufficient to predict the biological activity of the product batch. Proton nuclear magnetic resonance spectrometry (1H-NMR) and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time of flight mass spectroscopy (MALDI-TOF MS) provide wide molecular characterization of samples.We aimed to assess if 1H-NMR and MALDI-TOF MS techniques can be used as quality control test potentially predicting the impact of a medium additive on cell proliferation.We tested the impact on ASC growth rate (cell proliferation assessment and cell morphology analysis) of four medium additives, obtained by different methods from human platelet apheresis product. In order to classify each medium additive, we evaluated growth factor concentrations and spectra obtained by 1H-NMR and by MALDI-TOF MS.Medium additive obtained by CaCl2 activation of platelet rich products induced higher proliferation rate vs additive derived from platelet depleted ones. Additives obtained by freeze-and-thaw methods weakly induced ASC proliferation. As expected, principal component analysis of growth factor concentrations did not unravel specific biochemical features characterizing medium additives in relation with their biological activity. Otherwise, while 1H-NMR showed a partial resolution capacity, analysis of MALDI-TOF MS spectra allowed unambiguous distinction between the medium additives we used to differently stimulate cell growth in vitro.MALDI-TOF and, despite limitations, 1H-NMR are promising cost effective and reliable quality controls to classify the potential of a medium additive to promote ASC growth. This can represent, after further investigations and appropriate validation, a significant advantage for GMP compliant manufacturing of advanced cell therapy products."

https://openalex.org/W2890333491,Twin and adoption studies find that non-shared environmental (NSE) factors account for variance in most behavioural traits and offer an explanation for why genetically identical individuals differ. Using data from a qualitative hypothesis-generating study we designed a quantitative measure of pupils' non-shared experiences at the end of formal compulsory education (SENSES: Student Experiences of Non-Shared Environment Scales). In Study 1 SENSES was administered to n = 117 16-19 year old twin pairs. Exploratory Factor Analysis yielded a 49-item 10 factor solution which explained 63% of the variance in responses. SENSES showed good internal consistency and convergent and divergent validity. In Study 2 this factor structure was confirmed with data from n = 926 twin pairs and external validity was demonstrated via significant correlations between 9 SENSES factors and both public examination performance and life satisfaction. These studies lend preliminary support to SENSES but further research is required to confirm its psychometric properties; to assess whether individual differences in SENSES are explained by NSE effects; and to explore whether SENSES explains variance in achievement and wellbeing.
