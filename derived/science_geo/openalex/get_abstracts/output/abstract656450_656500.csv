https://openalex.org/W3044412215,"Multi-scale simulations, combining muscle and joint contact force (JCF) from musculoskeletal simulations with adaptive mechanobiological finite element analysis, allow to estimate musculoskeletal loading and predict femoral growth in children. Generic linearly scaled musculoskeletal models are commonly used. This approach, however, neglects subject- and age-specific musculoskeletal geometry, e.g. femoral neck-shaft angle (NSA) and anteversion angle (AVA). This study aimed to evaluate the impact of proximal femoral geometry, i.e. altered NSA and AVA, on hip JCF and femoral growth simulations. Musculoskeletal models with NSA ranging from 120° to 150° and AVA ranging from 20° to 50° were created and used to calculate muscle and hip JCF based on the gait analysis data of a typically developing child. A finite element model of a paediatric femur was created from magnetic resonance images. The finite element model was morphed to the geometries of the different musculoskeletal models and used for mechanobiological finite element analysis to predict femoral growth trends. Our findings showed that hip JCF increase with increasing NSA and AVA. Furthermore, the orientation of the hip JCF followed the orientation of the femoral neck axis. Consequently, the osteogenic index, which is a function of cartilage stresses and defines the growth rate, barely changed with altered NSA and AVA. Nevertheless, growth predictions were sensitive to the femoral geometry due to changes in the predicted growth directions. Altered NSA had a bigger impact on the growth results than altered AVA. Growth simulations based on mechanobiological principles were in agreement with reported changes in paediatric populations."
https://openalex.org/W3043909968,"To describe the clinical features, outcomes, and molecular epidemiology of an outbreak of multidrug resistant (MDR) A. baumannii.We performed a retrospective analysis of all MDR A. baumannii isolates recovered during an outbreak from 2011 to 2015 in a tertiary care cancer hospital. Cases were classified as colonized or infected. We determined sequence types following the Bartual scheme and plasmid profiles.There were 106 strains of A. baumannii isolated during the study period. Sixty-six (62.3%) were considered as infection and 40 (37.7%) as colonization. The index case, identified by molecular epidemiology, was a patient with a drain transferred from a hospital outside Mexico City. Ninety-eight additional cases had the same MultiLocus Sequence Typing (MLST) 758, of which 94 also had the same plasmid profile, two had an extra plasmid, and two had a different plasmid. The remaining seven isolates belonged to different MLSTs. Fifty-three patients (50%) died within 30 days of A. baumanniii isolation: 28 (20%) in colonized and 45 (68.2%) in those classified as infection (p<0.001). In multivariate regression analysis, clinical infection and patients with hematologic neoplasm, predicted 30-day mortality. The molecular epidemiology of this outbreak showed the threat posed by the introduction of MDR strains from other institutions in a hospital of immunosuppressed patients and highlights the importance of adhering to preventive measures, including contact isolation, when admitting patients with draining wounds who have been hospitalized in other institutions."
https://openalex.org/W3044633750,"Chemical absorption of carbon dioxide from flue or natural gas in hollow-fiber membrane contactors (HFMCs) has been one of the most beneficial techniques to alleviate its emission into the environment. A theoretical research study was done to investigate the change in membrane specifications and operating conditions on CO2 absorption using different alkanolamine solvents. The mathematical model was developed for a parallel counter-current fluid flow through a HFMC. The developed model's equations were solved based on finite element method. The simulations revealed that the increase in membrane porosity, length and the number of fibers has a positive impact on CO2 removal, while the gas flow rate and tortuosity enhancement resulted in the reduction of CO2 absorption. Furthermore, it was found that 4-diethylamino-2-butanol (DEAB) with approximately 100% CO2 absorption is suggested as the best solvent in this system, but ethyl-ethanolamine (EEA) with only 46% CO2 absorption had the lowest capacity for CO2 absorption (DEAB>MEA>EDA>MDEA>TEA>EEA). It is worth pointing out that the CO2 absorption can be improved using EEA solvent via change in membrane specifications such as increase in membrane porosity, length and the number of fibres."
https://openalex.org/W3045319269,"The initial exponential growth rate of an epidemic is an important measure that follows directly from data at hand, commonly used to infer the basic reproduction number. As the growth rates λ(t) of tested positive COVID-19 cases have crossed the threshold in many countries, with negative numbers as surrogate for disease transmission deceleration, lockdowns lifting are linked to the behavior of the momentary reproduction numbers r(t), often called R0. Important to note that this concept alone can be easily misinterpreted as it is bound to many internal assumptions of the underlying model and significantly affected by the assumed recovery period. Here we present our experience, as part of the Basque Country Modeling Task Force (BMTF), in monitoring the development of the COVID-19 epidemic, by considering not only the behaviour of r(t) estimated for the new tested positive cases—significantly affected by the increased testing capacities, but also the momentary growth rates for hospitalizations, ICU admissions, deceased and recovered cases, in assisting the Basque Health Managers and the Basque Government during the lockdown lifting measures. Two different data sets, collected and then refined during the COVID-19 responses, are used as an exercise to estimate the momentary growth rates and reproduction numbers over time in the Basque Country, and the implications of using those concepts to make decisions about easing lockdown and relaxing social distancing measures are discussed. These results are potentially helpful for task forces around the globe which are now struggling to provide real scientific advice for health managers and governments while the lockdown measures are relaxed."
https://openalex.org/W3045123951,"Background Nurses have a primary role in providing palliative and end-of-life (EOL) care. Their knowledge of EOL care, attitudes toward care of the dying, and palliative care self-efficacy are important in care delivery. Little is known regarding palliative care preparedness among Mongolian nurses. This study examines palliative care knowledge, attitude towards death and dying, and self-efficacy among Mongolian nurses, and examines predictors of self-efficacy. Methods A cross-sectional descriptive study was conducted. Participants were 141 nurses employed at the National Cancer Center in Mongolia. Data was collected using a self-administered questionnaire. Results The median score for the knowledge of palliative care was 8.0/20. “Psychosocial and spiritual care” was the lowest score on the palliative care knowledge subscale. The mean score for attitude toward care of the dying was 69.1%, indicating positive attitudes. The mean score for the palliative care self-efficacy was 33.8/48. Nurses reported low self-efficacy toward communicating with dying patients and their families, and managing delirium. Palliative care knowledge and duration of experience as an oncology nurse significantly predicted self-efficacy toward palliative care, accounting for 14.0% of the variance. Conclusions Palliative education for nurses should address the knowledge gaps in EOL care and focus in increasing palliative care self-efficacy. Considering palliative care knowledge and nursing experience as an oncology nurse were significant predictors of self-efficacy toward palliative care, more effort is needed to fill the knowledge gaps in EOL care among nurses, especially for less experienced nurses."
https://openalex.org/W3045262318,"To evaluate retinal axonal density and retinal capillary flow density (CFD) variations in patients affected by multiple sclerosis (MS) as documented by Optical Coherence Tomography Angiography (OCT-A).A cross-sectional study was performed in a tertiary university eye hospital on 94 eyes from 48 MS patients compared to 37 eyes from 23 matched controls. MS patients were divided in two groups: those with previous episodes of optic neuritis (MS ON+, 71.4%) and those without any previous visual complaint (no optic neuritis group, MS ON, 28.6%). Patients underwent macular and optic nerve head OCT-A with Optovue XR Avanti (Optovue, Freemont, California) after that preliminary evaluation of the ganglion cell complex (GCC) and of the retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) was achieved for each single eye by SD-OCT. CFD was evaluated in three different retinal layers of MS patients and controls: superficial capillary plexus (SCP), deep capillary plexus (DCP) and the choriocapillaris layer (CL). Each layer was analyzed in 18 preset subregions automatically detected by the system. CFD values were then correlated to the RNFL thickness and GCC thickness in the groups: p values were computed by t-tests between each group of MS patients and controls. A p-value of <0.05 was considered significant.A significant difference in the overall CFD values was found between ON+ and ON- patients when compared to controls in 18 subregions of SCP. Furthermore, a significant difference was found between MS patients and controls in 16 subregions analyzed corresponding to the CL layer without difference between the two MS subgroups (ON+ and ON-).OCT-A when performed at the optic nerve head level and at the macular region is characterized by a reduction of retinal perfusion in a significant portion of MS patients independently if they had a previous history of optic nerve inflammation or not."
https://openalex.org/W3044011689,"Background Endometrial cancer (EC) mortality is particularly high among non-Hispanic Blacks and is twice that of non-Hispanic Whites. However, comparisons of EC survival outcomes by race/ethnicity are often confounded by histology and grade. Here, we analyze EC survival disparities in multiracial Florida with a focus on EC types (1 and 2) and subtypes, defined according to histology and grade. Methods All 27,809 cases of EC diagnosed during 2005–2016 were obtained from the Florida Cancer Registry. Age-standardized, 5-year cause-specific survival by race/ethnicity and histological type were calculated. Fine and Gray competing risk regression was used to estimate sub-distribution hazard ratios (sHRs) for associations between risk of death due to EC and potential predictive factors such as histology/grade, age, stage at diagnosis, and insurance. Results Type 2 EC accounted for only 38.7% of all incident EC-cases but 74.6% of all EC-deaths. Blacks were disproportionately affected by type 2 EC (57.6%) compared to Whites, Hispanics, and Asians (35.6%, 37.7%, and 43.0%, respectively). Age-adjusted 5-year survival for types 1 and 2 were 85.3% and 51.6%, respectively; however, there was wide variation within type 2 subtypes, ranging from 60.2% for mixed cell EC to as low as 30.1% for carcinosarcoma. In the multivariable model, Blacks with type 2 EC had a 23% higher risk of death due to EC (sHR: 1.23, 95%CI: 1.12–1.36) compared to Whites. Conclusions Population-based analyses should consider the histological heterogeneity of EC because the less common type 2 EC drives racial/ethnic survival disparities in EC. Black women have a higher proportion of more aggressive histological types and an overall higher risk of death due to EC than Whites. To the extent that some of these histological types may be considered different diseases and require specific treatment approaches, further research on etiology and prognosis for detailed type 2 EC subtypes is warranted."
https://openalex.org/W3044854238,"Cortical spreading depolarization (SD) waves negatively affect neuronal survival and outcome after ischemic stroke. We here aimed to investigate the effects of vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) on SDs in a rat model of focal ischemia. To this end, we delivered non-invasive VNS (nVNS) or invasive VNS (iVNS) during permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO), and found that both interventions significantly reduced the frequency of SDs in the cortical peri-infarct area compared to sham VNS, without affecting relative blood flow changes, blood pressure, heart rate or breathing rate. In separate groups of rats subjected to transient MCAO, we found that cortical stroke volume was reduced 72 h after transient MCAO, whereas stroke volume in the basal ganglia remained unchanged. In rats treated with nVNS, motor outcome was improved 2 days after transient MCAO, but was similar to sham VNS animals 3 days after ischemia. We postulate that VNS may be a safe and efficient intervention to reduce the clinical burden of SD waves in stroke and other conditions."
https://openalex.org/W3045232239,"Pregnancy termination is one of the key issues that require urgent attention in achieving the third Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) of ensuring healthy lives and promoting well-being for all at all ages. The reproductive health decision-making (RHDM) capacity of women plays a key role in their reproductive health outcomes, including pregnancy termination. Based on this premise, we examined RHDM capacity and pregnancy termination among women of reproductive age in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA).We pooled data from the women's files of the most recent Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) of 27 countries in SSA, which are part of the DHS programme. The total sample was 240,489 women aged 15 to 49. We calculated the overall prevalence of pregnancy termination in the 27 countries as well as the prevalence in each individual country. We also examined the association between RHDM capacity, socio-demographic characteristics and pregnancy termination. RHDM was generated from two variables: decision-making on sexual intercourse and decision-making on condom use. Binary logistic regression analysis was conducted and presented as Crude Odds Ratios (COR) and Adjusted Odds Ratios (AOR) with their corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CI). Statistical significance was declared p<0.05.The prevalence of pregnancy termination ranged from 7.5% in Benin to 39.5% in Gabon with an average of 16.5%. Women who were capable of taking reproductive health decisions had higher odds of terminating a pregnancy than those who were incapable (AOR = 1.20, 95% CI = 1.17-1.24). We also found that women aged 45-49 (AOR = 5.54, 95% CI = 5.11-6.01), women with primary level of education (AOR = 1.14, 95% CI = 1.20-1.17), those cohabiting (AOR = 1.08, 95% CI = 1.04-1.11), those in the richest wealth quintile (AOR = 1.06, 95% CI = 1.02-1.11) and women employed in the services sector (AOR = 1.35, 95% CI = 1.27-1.44) were more likely to terminate pregnancies. Relatedly, women who did not intend to use contraceptive (AOR = 1.47, 95% CI = 1.39-1.56), those who knew only folkloric contraceptive method (AOR = 1.25, 95% CI = 1.18-1.32), women who watched television almost every day (AOR = 1.16, 95% CI = 1.20-1.24) and those who listened to radio almost every day (AOR = 1.11, 95% CI = 1.04-1.18) had higher odds of terminating a pregnancy. However, women with four or more children had the lowest odds (AOR = 0.5, 95% CI = 0.54-0.60) of terminating a pregnancy.We found that women who are capable of taking reproductive health decisions are more likely to terminate pregnancies. Our findings also suggest that age, level of education, contraceptive use and intention, place of residence, and parity are associated with pregnancy termination. Our findings call for the implementation of policies or the strengthening of existing ones to empower women about RHDM capacity. Such empowerment could have a positive impact on their uptake of safe abortions. Achieving this will not only accelerate progress towards the achievement of maternal health-related SDGs but would also immensely reduce the number of women who die as a result of pregnancy termination in SSA."
https://openalex.org/W3044831434,"Histidine-rich protein 2 (HRP2) detecting rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) have played an important role in enabling prompt malaria diagnosis in remote locations. However, emergence of pfhrp2 deleted parasites is threatening the efficacy of RDTs, and the World Health Organization (WHO) has highlighted surveillance of these deletions as a priority. Nested PCR is used to confirm pfhrp2 deletion but is costly and laborious. Due to spurious amplification of paralogue pfhrp3, the identity of nested exon 1 PCR product must be confirmed by sequencing. Here we describe a new one-step PCR method for detection of pfhrp2. To determine sensitivity and specificity, all PCRs were performed in triplicate. Using photo-induced electron transfer (PET) PCR detecting 18srRNA as true positive, one-step had comparable sensitivity of 95.0% (88.7-98.4%) to nested exon 1, 99.0% (94.6-99.9%) and nested exon 2, 98.0% (93.0-99.8%), and comparable specificity 93.8% (69.8-99.8%) to nested exon 1 100.0% (79.4-100.0%) and nested exon 2, 100.0% (74.4-100.0%). Sequencing revealed that one step PCR does not amplify pfhrp3. Logistic regression models applied to measure the 95% level of detection of the one-step PCR in clinical isolates provided estimates of 133p/μL (95% confidence interval (CI): 3-793p/μL) for whole blood (WB) samples and 385p/μL (95% CI: 31-2133 p/μL) for dried blood spots (DBSs). When considering protocol attributes, the one-step PCR is less expensive, faster and more suitable for high throughput. In summary, we have developed a more accurate PCR method that may be ideal for the application of the WHO protocol for investigating pfhrp2 deletions in symptomatic individuals presenting to health care facilities."
https://openalex.org/W3044973746,"Tuberculosis (TB) is the seventh leading cause of morbidity and mortality in Bangladesh. Although the National TB control program (NTP) of Bangladesh is implementing its nationwide TB control strategies, more specific and effective single or combination interventions are needed to control drug-susceptible (DS) and multi-drug resistant (MDR) TB. In this study, we developed a two strain TB mathematical model with amplification and fit it to the Bangladesh TB data to understand the transmission dynamics of DS and MDR TB. Sensitivity analysis was used to identify important parameters. We evaluated the cost-effectiveness of varying combinations of four basic control strategies including distancing, latent case finding, case holding and active case finding, all within the optimal control framework. From our fitting, the model with different transmission rates between DS and MDR TB best captured the Bangladesh TB reported case counts. The estimated basic reproduction number for DS TB was 1.14 and for MDR TB was 0.54, with an amplification rate of 0.011 per year. The sensitivity analysis also indicated that the transmission rates for both DS and MDR TB had the largest influence on prevalence. To reduce the burden of TB (both DS and MDR), our finding suggested that a quadruple control strategy that combines distancing control, latent case finding, case holding and active case finding is the most cost-effective. Alternative strategies can be adopted to curb TB depending on availability of resources and policy makers’ decisions."
https://openalex.org/W3044326333,"Thermophilic microorganisms and their enzymes have been utilized in various industrial applications. In this work, we isolated and characterized thermophilic anaerobic bacteria with the cellulose and hemicellulose degrading activities from a tropical dry deciduous forest in northern Thailand. Out of 502 isolated thermophilic anaerobic soil bacteria, 6 isolates, identified as Thermoanaerobacterium sp., displayed an ability to utilize a wide range of oligosaccharides and lignocellulosic substrates. The isolates exhibited significant cellulase and xylanase activities at high temperature (65°C). Among all isolates, Thermoanaerobacterium sp. strain R63 exhibited remarkable hydrolytic properties with the highest cellulase and xylanase activities at 1.15 U/mg and 6.17 U/mg, respectively. Extracellular extract of Thermoanaerobacterium sp. strain R63 was thermostable with an optimal temperature at 65°C and could exhibit enzymatic activities on pH range 5.0–9.0. Our findings suggest promising applications of these thermoanaerobic bacteria and their potent enzymes for industrial purposes."
https://openalex.org/W3044418267,"The transmission of human norovirus excreted from infected persons occasionally causes sporadic infections and outbreaks. Both symptomatic patients and asymptomatic carriers have been reported to contribute to norovirus transmission, but little is known about the magnitude of the contribution of asymptomatic carriers. We carried out a 1-year survey of residents of a district of Bangkok, Thailand to determine the percentage of norovirus transmissions originating from asymptomatic individuals. We screened 38 individuals recruited from 16 families from May 2018 to April 2019 for GI and GII genotypes. Norovirus was detected every month, and 101 of 716 stool samples (14.1%) from individuals with no symptoms of acute gastroenteritis were norovirus-positive. The average infection frequency was 2.4 times per person per year. Fourteen genotypes were identified from the positive samples, with GII.4 being detected most frequently. Notably, 89.1% of the norovirus-positive samples were provided by individuals with no diarrhea episode. Similar to cases of symptomatic infections in Thailand, asymptomatic infections were observed most frequently in December. We detected 4 cases of NV infection caused by household transmission, and 3 of the 4 transmissions originated from asymptomatic individuals. We also identified a case in which norovirus derived from an asymptomatic individual caused diarrhea in a family member. These results suggest that asymptomatic individuals play a substantial role in both the maintenance and spreading of norovirus in a community through household transmission."
https://openalex.org/W3044717210,"An increasing number of studies have shown that anthropogenic noise can negatively affect aspects of the anti-predator behaviour of reef fishes, potentially affecting fitness and survival. However, it has been suggested that effects could differ among noise sources. The present study compared two common sources of anthropogenic noise and investigated its effects on behavioural traits critical for fish survival. In a tank-based experiment we examined the effects of noise from 4-stroke motorboats and ships (bulk carriers > 50,000 tonnes) on the routine swimming and escape response of a coral reef fish, the whitetail damselfish (Pomacentrus chrysurus). Both 4-stroke boat and ship noise playbacks affected the fast-start response and routine swimming of whitetail damselfish, however the magnitude of the effects differed. Fish exposed to ship noise moved shorter distances and responded more slowly (higher response latency) to the startle stimulus compared to individuals under the 4-stroke noise treatment. Our study suggests that 4-stroke and ship noise can affect activity and escape response of individuals to a simulated predation threat, potentially compromising their anti-predator behaviour."
https://openalex.org/W3044697089,"Dream reports collected after rapid eye movement sleep (REM) awakenings are, on average, longer, more vivid, bizarre, emotional and story-like compared to those collected after non-REM. However, a comparison of the word-to-word structural organization of dream reports is lacking, and traditional measures that distinguish REM and non-REM dreaming may be confounded by report length. This problem is amenable to the analysis of dream reports as non-semantic directed word graphs, which provide a structural assessment of oral reports, while controlling for individual differences in verbosity. Against this background, the present study had two main aims: Firstly, to investigate differences in graph structure between REM and non-REM dream reports, and secondly, to evaluate how non-semantic directed word graph analysis compares to the widely used measure of report length in dream analysis. To do this, we analyzed a set of 133 dream reports obtained from 20 participants in controlled laboratory awakenings from REM and N2 sleep. We found that: (1) graphs from REM sleep possess a larger connectedness compared to those from N2; (2) measures of graph structure can predict ratings of dream complexity, where increases in connectedness and decreases in randomness are observed in relation to increasing dream report complexity; and (3) measures of the Largest Connected Component of a graph can improve a model containing report length in predicting sleep stage and dream report complexity. These results indicate that dream reports sampled after REM awakening have on average a larger connectedness compared to those sampled after N2 (i.e. words recur with a longer range), a difference which appears to be related to underlying differences in dream complexity. Altogether, graph analysis represents a promising method for dream research, due to its automated nature and potential to complement report length in dream analysis."
https://openalex.org/W3044901369,"Feed constitutes 50–70% of total production costs of tilapia, one of the most widely cultured finfishes in the world. We evaluated reduced-feeding strategies for improving production efficiency of Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus). In a 12-week pond trial, fish were fed daily, every other day, every third day, or not at all. Ponds were fertilized to enhance natural foods. In a fifth group fish were fed daily without pond fertilization. Fish fed daily with or without pond fertilization and fish fed every other day had higher specific growth rates, survivability, and net production than the other two treatments. Fish feed efficiency and benefit to cost ratio was highest for treatments fed in a pulsatile manner (i.e. fed every other day or every third day) with fish fed on alternate days providing the best net return among all groups. Fish fed on alternate days had more moderate gene expression levels of intestinal nutrient transporters which may allow for a more balanced and efficient nutrient uptake. Fecal microbe analyses identified 145 families of prokaryotic and 132 genera of eukaryotic organisms in tilapia. The highest diversity of prokaryotes was found in fish fed either every other day or daily in fertilized ponds and the highest diversity of eukaryotes was found in fish fed every other day. These studies indicate feeding Nile tilapia on alternate days along with weekly pond fertilization has no deleterious effects on growth, survivability, or production versus daily feeding regimes, but enhances feed efficiency by 76% and provides the greatest net return on investments. Our studies also suggest for the first time that combining alternate-day feeding with pond fertilization produces the greatest microbial biodiversity in the intestine that could contribute to enhanced feed efficiency and overall health of tilapia."
https://openalex.org/W3045036740,"Non-communicable diseases (NCDs) have emerged as one of the major endemics in Fiji which is responsible for more than 80 percent of deaths annually. In this study, we estimate the economic burden of non-communicable disease mortality in Fiji. The specific impact of diabetes, cardiovascular disease, chronic respiratory disease and cancer-related mortality on Fiji’s output is also investigated using the autoregressive distributed lag bounds tests approach to cointegration. The data used is compiled from Fiji Ministry of Health and Medical Services and World Health Organization’s Mortality database. Overall, the study finds that NCD mortality rate together with cardiovascular disease, diabetes, chronic respiratory disease and cancer have a significant negative effect on output per capita of Fiji between 1972 and 2016. A one percentage point increase in NCD-mortality rate reduced output per capita by 0.012 percent. In addition, a percentage point increase in the mortality rates of cardiovascular disease, diabetes, chronic respiratory disease and cancer decreased output per capita by 0.018, 0.01, 0.031, and 0.035 percent, respectively. The findings conclude that NCD poses significant economic burden in Fiji and recommend policy innovations in lessening the high risk of NCD among the Fijian population."
https://openalex.org/W3045259899,"We explored factors associated with performance on the Reading the Mind in the Eyes Test (RMET). 180 undergraduate students completed the human RMET requiring forced-choice mental state judgment; a control human Age Eyes Test (AET) requiring age judgment; a Cat Eyes Test (CET) requiring mental state judgment; and measures of executive function, empathy and psychopathology. Versions of the CET and AET were created that matched the RMET for difficulty (accuracy 71%). RMET and CET performance were strongly correlated after accounting for AET performance. Working memory, schizotypal personality and empathy predicted RMET accuracy but not CET scores. Liking dogs predicted higher accuracy on all eyes tasks, whereas liking cats predicted greater mentalizing but reduced emotional expression. Importantly, we replicated our core findings relating to accuracy and correlations between the CET and RMET in a second sample of 228 students. In conclusion, people can apply similar skills when interpreting cat and human expressions. As RMET and CET performance were found to be differentially affected by executive function and psychopathology, the use of social cognitive measures featuring non-human animals may be of particular use in future clinical research."
https://openalex.org/W3044104349,"Lifestyle risk factors, such as unhealthy diet, physical inactivity or tobacco smoking can have detrimental effects on health and well-being. Therefore, it is important to examine multiple lifestyle risk factors instead of single ones. Cluster analysis allows the combination of single health behaviors in order to recognize distinguished behavior patterns. This study aimed to evaluate lifestyle patterns of general adult population in northwest of Iran with particular focus on dietary patterns, physical activity, and smoking status.The current cross-sectional study consists of 525 adults aged 18-64 years from East-Azarbaijan Iran. Latent class analysis (LCA) was applied to recognize patterns of lifestyle behaviors with ingredients of diet, physical activity, and smoking status. Dietary intake was assessed using a validated food frequency questionnaire and dietary patterns were derived using factor analysis. Biochemical parameters including fasting blood sugar (FBS), serum lipids, liver enzyme and serum 25(OH)-D3 were measured with commercial ELIZA kits.Mean ages of participants were 42.90 ± 11.89 years. Using principal component analysis (PCA) three major dietary patterns were extracted including traditional dietary pattern (e.g. nuts and dry fruits), unhealthy dietary pattern (e.g. fast foods, refined grains) and the healthy dietary patterns (e.g. fruits, vegetables). Using LCA, three classes of lifestyles pattern were identified: 1st class was characterized by a healthy dietary pattern, moderate physical activity, and low probability of smoking. 2nd class was characterized by a traditional dietary pattern, low level of physical activity and low probability of smoking and 3rd class was characterized by a unhealthy dietary pattern, low level of physical activity and low probability of smoking and further analysis found that there were significant differences in body mass index (BMI), Waist-to-hip ratio (WHR), FBS, Hemoglobin (Hb), education levels and anxiety status between classes (P <0.05).This study attempts to classify Iranian adults by their own health behavior. Healthcare professionals should be aware of associations between different lifestyle risk factors and health promotion strategies should further focus on multiple behaviors at the same time. In our country, more studies about the adult population are needed to support the observed findings of our study and therefore allow for a certain generalization of the observations."
https://openalex.org/W3044959795,"Nuclear IGF1R has been linked to poor outcome in cancer. We recently showed that nuclear IGF1R phosphorylates PCNA and increases DNA damage tolerance. In this paper we aimed to describe this mechanism in cancer tissue as well as in cancer cell lines. In situ proximity ligation assay identified frequent IGF1R and PCNA colocalization in many cancer types. IGF1R/PCNA colocalization was more frequently increased in tumor cells than in adjacent normal, and more prominent in areas with dysplasia and invasion. However, the interaction was often lost in tumors with poor response to neoadjuvant treatment and most metastatic lesions. In two independent cohorts of serous ovarian carcinomas and oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinomas, stronger IGF1R/PCNA colocalization was significantly associated with a higher overall survival. Ex vivo irradiation of ovarian cancer tissue acutely induced IGF1R/PCNA colocalization together with γH2AX-foci formations. In vitro, RAD18 mediated mono-ubiquitination of PCNA during replication stress was dependent on IGF1R kinase activity. DNA fiber analysis revealed that IGF1R activation could rescue stalled DNA replication forks, but only in cancer cells with baseline IGF1R/PCNA interaction. We believe that the IGF1R/PCNA interaction is a basic cellular mechanism to increase DNA stress tolerance during proliferation, but that this mechanism is lost with tumor progression in conjunction with accumulated DNA damage and aberrant strategies to tolerate genomic instability. To exploit this mechanism in IGF1R targeted therapy, IGF1R inhibitors should be explored in the context of concomitant induction of DNA replication stress as well as in earlier clinical stages than previously tried."
https://openalex.org/W3045136917,"Peptide signalling is an integral part of cell-to-cell communication which helps to relay the information responsible for coordinating cell proliferation and differentiation. Phytosulfokine Receptor (PSKR) is a transmembrane LRR-RLK family protein with a binding site for small signalling peptide, phytosulfokine (PSK). PSK signalling through PSKR promotes normal growth and development and also plays a role in defense responses. Like other RLKs, these PSKRs might have a role in signal transduction pathways related to abiotic stress responses. Genome-wide analysis of phytosulfokine receptor gene family has led to the identification of fifteen putative members in the Oryza sativa genome. The expression analysis of OsPSKR genes done using RNA-seq data, showed that these genes were differentially expressed in different tissues and responded specifically to heat, salt, drought and cold stress. Furthermore, the real-time quantitative PCR for fifteen OsPSKR genes revealed temporally and spatially regulated gene expression corresponding to salinity and drought stress. Our results provide useful information for a better understanding of OsPSKR genes and provide the foundation for additional functional exploration of the rice PSKR gene family in development and stress response."

Understanding the species-specific traits of photosynthetic electron transport is extremely important, because it contributes to the regulation of ATP/NADPH ratio, which has direct/indirect links to carbon fixation and other metabolic pathways and thus overall growth and biomass production. In the present work, a cuvette-based setup is developed, in which a combination of measurements of dissolved oxygen, pH, chlorophyll fluorescence and NADPH kinetics can be performed without disturbing the physiological status of the sample. The suitability of the system is demonstrated using a model cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. PCC6803, as well as biofuel-candidate microalgae species, such as Chlorella sorokiniana, Dunaliella salina and Nannochloropsis limnetica undergoing inorganic carbon (Ci) limitation. Inorganic carbon limitation, induced by photosynthetic Ci uptake under continuous illumination, caused a decrease in the effective quantum yield of PSII (Y(II)) and loss of oxygen-evolving capacity in all species investigated here; these effects were largely recovered by the addition of NaHCO3. Detailed analysis of the dark-light and light-dark transitions of NADPH production/uptake and changes in chlorophyll fluorescence kinetics revealed species- and condition-specific responses. These responses indicate that the impact of decreased Calvin-Benson cycle activity on photosynthetic electron transport pathways involving several sections of the electron transport chain (such as electron transfer via the QA-QB-plastoquinone pool, the redox state of the plastoquinone pool) can be analyzed with high sensitivity in a comparative manner. Therefore, the integrated system presented here can be applied for screening for specific traits in several significant species at different stages of inorganic carbon limitation, a condition that strongly impacts primary productivity."
https://openalex.org/W3044726889,"The bidirectional selection of high and low anxiety-like behavior is a valuable tool for understanding the neurocircuits that are responsible for anxiety disorders. Our group developed two breeding lines of rats, known as Carioca High- and Low-conditioned Freezing (CHF and CLF), based on defensive freezing in the contextual fear conditioning paradigm. A random selected line was employed as a control (CTL) comparison group for both CHF and CLF lines of animals. The present study performed Fos immunochemistry to investigate changes in neural activity in different brain structures among CHF and CLF rats when they were exposed to contextual cues that were previously associated with footshock.The study indicated that CHF rats expressed high Fos expression in the locus coeruleus, periventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus (PVN), and lateral portion of the septal area and low Fos expression in the medial portion of the septal area, dentate gyrus, and prelimbic cortex (PL) compared to CTL animals. CLF rats exhibited a decrease in Fos expression in the PVN, PL, and basolateral nucleus of the amygdala and increase in the cingulate and perirhinal cortices compared to CTL animals.Both CHF and CLF rats displayed Fos expression changes key regions of the anxiety brain circuitry. The two bidirectional lines exhibit different pattern of neural activation and inhibition with opposing influences on the PVN, the main structure involved in regulating the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal neuroendocrine responses observed in anxiety disorders."

Players (n = 75; age 12–20 years; stature 1.47–1.95 m; body mass 36–89 kg) from U-12 to U-23 age groups were assigned to either: 1) intra-rater-fixed order; 2) intra-rater-non-fixed order; 3) inter-rater-fixed order; or, 4) inter-rater-non-fixed order groups. On two separate occasions separated by 3 to 7 days, 12 raters conducted a musculoskeletal profiling test battery comprising 10 tests (Supine Medial Hip Rotation, Supine Lateral Hip Rotation, Hamstring 90/90, Prone Medial Hip Rotation [degrees]; Combined Elevation, Thoracic Rotation, Weight-Bearing Dorsiflexion, Y-Balance [centimetres]; Beighton, Lumbar Quadrant [categorical]). The measurement error / reliability for tests measured in degrees and centimetres was evaluated using the intraclass correlation (relative reliability), coefficient of variation and ratio limits of agreement (absolute reliability). Intraclass correlations varied from 0.04 (“poor”) to 0.95 (“excellent”), coefficient of variation from 2.9 to 43.4%, and the ratio limits of agreement from 1.058 (*/÷ 1.020) to 2.026 (*/÷ 1.319) for the tests measured in degrees and centimetres. The intraclass correlation, coefficient of variation and ratio limits of agreement were smallest for five out of eight tests measured in degrees and centimetres when the tests were administered in an intra-rater-fixed test order. These findings emphasise that different testing methods, and the administration of a musculoskeletal profiling test battery using a less than optimal design, will influence measurement error and hence test reliability. These observations need to be considered when investigating musculoskeletal function and age, injury, training or asymmetry in young, elite academy soccer players."

A series of comprehensive simulation studies show that the proposed method is capable of accurate selection and therefore improves the performance of current methods such as Bayesian SourceTracker and FEAST in the presence of noise microbial sources."
https://openalex.org/W3044001844,"Introduction Adequate and sustainable funding of national medicine regulatory agencies (NMRAs) is key for assurance of quality, safety and efficacy of medical products circulating in a market. The study aimed to determine factors affecting NMRAs funding in five East African Community (EAC) countries namely: Burundi, Kenya, Rwanda, Tanzania (Mainland and Zanzibar) and Uganda. Methodology An exploratory, mixed method design using both qualitative and quantitative data, was employed. Data from six NMRAs was collected through a combination of semi-structured interviews, questionnaires, and checklists for the period 2011/12-2014/15 while 2010/11 data served as baseline. Interviews were conducted with heads of NMRAs and monitoring and evaluation experts of the respective agencies. NMRA’s financing was assessed using six indicators namely, funding policy, financial autonomy, the total annual budget, actual funding per annum, funds received from various sources, and the NMRA expenditure. Results The average total annual budget for all the EAC countries during the study period 2011–2015 ranged from USD 824,328.67 to USD 10,724,536.50. The low budget in Zanzibar may be attributed to population and pharmaceutical market size. Uganda’s attainment of 98.75% (USD 10,656,704) revenue from industry fees is a result of deliberate government policy change from 100% reliance on donor funding over a period of 10 years (1995–2015). On average, the proportion of revenue against budget per annum is 54.8% (USD 458,970.11), 98.7% (USD 10,302,295.25) and 100% (USD 7,375,802.08) for Zanzibar Food & Drugs Agency (ZFDA), Uganda National Drug Authority (NDA) and Tanzania Medicines and Medical Devices Authority (TMDA) respectively. Governments, industry fees and donors are the major sources of funding across all NMRAs in the EAC region, with TMDA and Uganda NDA relying more on industry fees by 73.20% (USD 4,664,777.59) and 98.25% (USD 8,077,238.20) respectively. While Burundi relies solely on government funding, ZFDA, on the other hand, received on average 50.40% (USD 252,557.22) from government and 40.60% (USD 165,303.34) from industry fees and the remaining 9% from donors and other sources. An overall contribution of funds received from donors by each NMRA was the least among other sources of financing. Observation of expenditure patterns indicated operational costs to be the major expense in the majority of the NMRAs, followed by salaries and infrastructure development. The Kenya NMRA has the highest degree of average expenditure across all three categories, with the least average expenditures being marked by Burundi NMRA. The operational costs on average increased considerably in all the NMRAs during the study period. Conclusion Evidence from the EAC suggests that government and industry fees are the main sources of funding while donor contributions vary from country to country. Government policy, legal framework, and fees structure are the key enablers of NMRAs funding sustainability."
https://openalex.org/W3044219003,"Acid adaptation enhances survival of foodborne pathogens under lethal acid conditions that prevail in several food-related ecosystems. In the present study, the role of undissociated acetic acid in inducing acid resistance of Salmonella Enteritidis Phage Type 4 both in laboratory media and in an acid food matrix was investigated. Several combinations of acetic acid (0, 15, 25, 35 and 45 mM) and pH values (4.0, 4.5, 5.0, 5.5, 6.0) were screened for their ability to activate acid resistance mechanisms of pathogen exposed to pH 2.5 (screening assay). Increased survival was observed when increasing undissociated acetic acid within a range of sublethal concentrations (1.9–5.4 mM), but only at pH 5.5 and 6.0. No effect was observed at lower pH values, regardless of the undissociated acetic acid levels. Three combinations (15mM/pH5.0, 35mM/pH5.5, 45mM/pH6.0) were selected and further used for adaptation prior to inoculation in commercial tarama (fish roe) salad, i.e., an acid spread (pH 4.35 ± 0.02), stored at 5°C. Surprisingly and contrary to the results of the screening assay, none of the acid adaptation treatments enhanced survival of Salmonella Enteritidis in the food matrix, as compared to non-adapted cells (control). Further examination of the food pH value, acidulant and storage (challenge) temperature on the responses of the pathogen adapted to 15mM/pH5.0, 35mM/pH5.5 and 45mM/pH6.0 was performed in culture media. Cells adapted to 35mM/pH5.5 were unable to induce acid resistance when exposed to pH 4.35 (tarama salad pH value) at 37°C and 5°C, whereas incubation under refrigeration (5°C) at pH 4.35 sensitized 45mM/pH6.0 adapted cells against the subsequent acid and cold stress. In conclusion, pre-exposure to undissociated acetic acid affected the adaptive responses of Salmonella Enteritidis Phage Type 4 in a concentration- and pH-dependent manner, with regard to conditions prevailing during acid challenge."
https://openalex.org/W3044774110,"Breadfruit is a traditional staple crop from Pacific islands with the potential to improve worldwide food security and mitigate diabetes. Flour produced from breadfruit is a gluten-free, low glycemic index, nutrient dense and complete protein option for modern foods but basic scientific knowledge of health impacts of a breadfruit-based diet in animals and humans was lacking. We designed a series of studies to provide basic and fundamental data on impacts of a breadfruit-based diet through an in vitro and in vivo model. Cooked breadfruit flour was digested through a multi-stage enzyme digestion model to estimate protein digestibility in comparison to wheat flour. Breadfruit protein was found to be easier to digest than wheat protein in the enzyme digestion model. The flour digestions were applied to Caco-2 cells to test the cytotoxicity and to measure the immunogenicity through cytokine expression. No significant differences were observed for immune factors and cytokines (IL-4, IL-10, IL-8, TNF-α, IFN-γ) on Caco-2 cells between the breadfruit and wheat groups. A breadfruit-based rodent chow was formulated by substitution of all of the wheat in the standard formulation with breadfruit. The diets were isocaloric, nutrient equivalent and used to feed male and female C57BL/6 mice for 21 days. No sign of malnutrition, discomfort, illness or death was observed among the mice because of the diet. The histology and the cytokine expression of the mice ileum from both groups were analyzed and showed similar results. The expression of major bacteria was measured in the colon and showed similar results. Mice fed the breadfruit diet had a significantly higher growth rate and body weight than standard diet fed mice. No negative health outcomes were observed in studies with in vitro or in vivo models and breadfruit flour is a healthy alternative to other starches for modern foods."
https://openalex.org/W3044865733,"Background To improve the quality of diagnosing pulmonary tuberculosis (TB), WHO recommends the use of rapid molecular testing as an alternative to conventional microscopic methods. Loop-mediated isothermal amplification assay (LAMP test) is a practical and cost-effective nucleic amplification technique. We evaluated the pragmatic accuracy of an in-house LAMP assay for the diagnosis of TB in a remote health care setting where an advanced rapid molecular test is not available. Methods A prospective diagnostic accuracy study was conducted. Patients with clinical symptoms suggestive of TB were consecutively enrolled from April to August 2016. Sputum samples were collected from each patient and were sent for microscopic examination (both acid-fast stain and fluorescence stain), in-house LAMP test, and TB culture. Results One hundred and seven patients with TB symptoms were used in the final analysis. This included 50 (46.7%) culture-positive TB patients and 57 (53.3%) culture-negative patients. The overall sensitivity of the in-house LAMP based on culture positivity was 88.8% (95/107) with a 95%CI of 81.2–94.1. The sensitivity was 90.9% (40/44) with a 95%CI of 78.3–97.5 for smear-positive, culture-positive patients, and was 16.7% (1/6) with a 95%CI of 0.4–64.1 for smear-negative, culture-positive patients. The overall sensitivity of the in-house LAMP test compared to smear microscopy methods were not significantly different (p = 0.375). The specificity of the in-house LAMP based on non-TB patients (smear-negative, culture-negative) was 94.7% (54/57) with a 95%CI of 85.4–98.9. Conclusions The diagnostic accuracy of the in-house LAMP test in a community hospital was comparable to other previous reports in terms of specificity. The sensitivity of the in-house assay could be improved with better sputum processing and DNA extraction method."
https://openalex.org/W3043895158,"The aim of this prospective cohort study was to examine whether oral hygiene knowledge, and the source of that knowledge, affect oral hygiene behavior in university students in Japan. An oral exam and questionnaire survey developed to evaluate oral hygiene knowledge, the source of that knowledge, and oral hygiene behavior, such as the frequency of tooth brushing and regular dental checkups and the use of dental floss, was conducted on university student volunteers. In total, 310 students with poor tooth brushing behavior (frequency of tooth brushing per day [≤ once]), 1,963 who did not use dental floss, and 1,882 who did not receive regular dental checkup during the past year were selected. Among these students, 50, 364, and 343 in each respective category were analyzed in over the 3-year study period (follow-up rates: 16.1%, 18.5%, and 18.2%, respectively). The odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for oral hygiene behavior were calculated based on oral hygiene knowledge and the source of that knowledge using logistic regression models. The results showed that dental clinics were the most common (> 50%) source of oral hygiene knowledge, and that a more frequent use of dental floss was significantly associated with dental clinics being a source of oral hygiene knowledge (OR, 4.11; 95%CI, 1.871-9.029; p < 0.001). In addition, a significant association was seen between dental clinics being a source of oral hygiene knowledge and more frequent regular dental checkups (OR, 13.626; 95%CI, 5.971-31.095; p < 0.001). These findings suggest the existence of a relationship between dental clinics being the most common source of oral hygiene knowledge and improved oral hygiene behavior in Japanese university students."
https://openalex.org/W3044541152,"Aims The European Senior Program (ESP) aims to avoid waiting list competition between younger and elderly patients applying for renal transplantation. By listing patients ≥65 years on a separate waiting list and locally allocating of grafts ≥65 years exclusively to this cohort, waiting and cold ischemia times are predicted to be shortened, potentially resulting in improved kidney transplantation outcomes. This study compared a historic cohort of renal transplant recipients being simultaneously listed on the general and the ESP waiting lists with a collective exclusively listed on the ESP list in terms of surrogates of the transplantation outcome. Methods Total 151 eligible patients ≥ 65 years from Münster transplant Center, Germany, between 1999 and 2014 were included. Graft function, graft and patient survival were compared using surrogate markers of short- and long-term graft function. Patients were grouped according to their time of transplantation. Results Recipients and donors in the newESP (nESP) cohort were significantly older (69.6 ± 3.5 years vs 67.1 ± 2 years, p<0.05; 72.0 ± 5.0 years vs 70.3 ± 5.0 years, p = 0.039), had significantly shorter dialysis vintage (19.6 ± 21.7 months vs 60.2 ± 28.1 months, p<0.001) and suffered from significantly more comorbidities (2.2 ± 0.9 vs 1.8 ± 0.8, p = 0.009) than the historic cohort (HC). Five-year death-censored graft survival was better than in the HC, but 5-year graft and patient survival were better in the ESP cohort. After 2005, cold ischemia time between groups was comparable. nESP grafts showed more primary function and significantly better long-term graft function 18 months after transplantation and onwards. Conclusion nESP recipients received significantly older grafts, but experienced significantly shorter time on dialysis. Cold ischemia times were comparable, but graft function in the nESP cohort was significantly better in the long term."
https://openalex.org/W3045279175,"Background Evidence suggests that the single-disease paradigm does not accurately reflect the individual experience, with increasing prevalence of chronic disease multimorbidity, and subtle yet important differences in types of co-occurring diseases. Knowledge of multimorbidity patterns can aid clarification of individual-level burden and needs, to inform prevention and treatment strategies. This study aimed to estimate the prevalence of multimorbidity in Jamaica, identify population subgroups with similar and distinct disease profiles, and examine consistency in patterns identified across statistical techniques. Methods Latent class analysis (LCA) was used to examine multimorbidity patterns in a sample of 2,551 respondents aged 15–74 years, based on data from the nationally representative Jamaica Health and Lifestyle Survey 2007/2008 and self-reported presence/absence of 11 chronic conditions. Secondary analyses compared results with patterns identified using exploratory factor analysis (EFA). Results Nearly one-quarter of the sample (24.1%) were multimorbid (i.e. had ≥2 diseases), with significantly higher burden in females compared to males (31.6% vs. 16.1%; p<0.001). LCA revealed four distinct classes, including a predominant Relatively Healthy class, comprising 52.7% of the sample, with little to no morbidity. The remaining three classes were characterized by varying degrees and patterns of multimorbidity and labelled Metabolic (30.9%), Vascular-Inflammatory (12.2%), and Respiratory (4.2%). Four diseases determined using physical assessments (obesity, hypertension, diabetes, hypercholesterolemia) were primary contributors to multimorbidity patterns overall. EFA identified three patterns described as “Vascular” (hypertension, obesity, hypercholesterolemia, diabetes, stroke); “Respiratory” (asthma, COPD); and “Cardio-Mental-Articular” (cardiovascular disease, arthritis, mental disorders). Conclusion This first study of multimorbidity in the Caribbean has revealed a high burden of co-existing conditions in the Jamaican population, that is predominantly borne by females. Consistency across methods supports the validity of patterns identified. Future research into the causes and consequences of multimorbidity patterns can guide development of clinical and public health strategies that allow for targeted prevention and intervention."

We measured perceived changes in attitude or behaviour of supervisors and co-workers, respondents’ perceived stress, and its outcomes such as psychological well-being and intention to leave the UK after the Brexit vote. Method 551 Polish migrants residing in various regions of the UK took part in the study in the form of Qualtrics online survey. We used self-report measures: Perceived Stress Scale, The Satisfaction with Life Scale, Scale of Psychological Well-being. Results The most of the respondents did not notice any change in the attitude or behaviour of the supervisor (81%) or co-workers (84%), and only a small percentage of the participants reported negative changes in attitude or behaviour of supervisors (9%) and co-workers (14%). Also, negative change in attitude or behaviour of supervisors or co-workers are associated with perceived stress, which inturn is linked with intention to leave the UK, psychological well-being and life satisfaction. Conclusion Polish and British co-existence in a workplace setting has not changed much after the Brexit vote."
https://openalex.org/W3045146239,"Although voltage-gated Ca2+ channels (VGCC) are a major Ca2+ entry pathway in vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs), several other Ca2+-influx mechanisms exist and play important roles in vasoreactivity. One of these is store-operated Ca2+ entry (SOCE), mediated by an interaction between STIM1 and Orai1. Although SOCE is an important mechanism of Ca2+ influx in non-excitable cells (cells that lack VGCC); there is debate regarding the contribution of SOCE to regulate VSMC contractility and the molecular components involved. Our previous data suggest acid-sensing ion channel 1a (ASIC1a) is a necessary component of SOCE and vasoconstriction in small pulmonary arteries. However, it is unclear if ASIC1a similarly contributes to SOCE and vascular reactivity in systemic arteries. Considering the established role of Orai1 in mediating SOCE in the systemic circulation, we hypothesize the involvement of ASIC1a in SOCE and resultant vasoconstriction is unique to the pulmonary circulation. To test this hypothesis, we examined the roles of Orai1 and ASIC1a in SOCE- and endothelin-1 (ET-1)-induced vasoconstriction in small pulmonary and mesenteric arteries. We found SOCE is coupled to vasoconstriction in pulmonary arteries but not mesenteric arteries. In pulmonary arteries, inhibition of ASIC1a but not Orai1 attenuated SOCE- and ET-1-induced vasoconstriction. However, neither inhibition of ASIC1a nor Orai1 altered ET-1-induced vasoconstriction in mesenteric arteries. We conclude that SOCE plays an important role in pulmonary, but not mesenteric, vascular reactivity. Furthermore, in contrast to the established role of Orai1 in SOCE in non-excitable cells, the SOCE response in pulmonary VSMCs is largely mediated by ASIC1a."
https://openalex.org/W3045414880,"Although in observational studies, propensity score matching is the most widely used balancing method, it has received much criticism. The main drawback of this method is that the individuals of the case and control groups are paired in the compressed one-dimensional space of propensity scores. In this paper, such a novel multivariate weighted k-nearest neighbours-based control group selection method is proposed which can eliminate this disadvantage of propensity score matching. The proposed method pairs the elements of the case and control groups in the original vector space of the covariates and the dissimilarities of the individuals are calculated as the weighted distances of the subjects. The weight factors are calculated from a logistic regression model fitted on the status of treatment assignment. The efficiency of the proposed method was evaluated by Monte Carlo simulations on different datasets. Experimental results show that the proposed Weighted Nearest Neighbours Control Group Selection with Error Minimization method is able to select a more balanced control group than the most widely applied greedy form of the propensity score matching method, especially for individuals characterized with few descriptive features."
https://openalex.org/W3043940593,"Functional brown adipose tissue (BAT) was identified in adult humans only in 2007 with the use of fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography imaging. Previous studies have demonstrated a negative correlation between obesity and BAT presence in humans. It is proposed that BAT possesses the capacity to increase metabolism and aid weight loss. In rodents it is well established that BAT is stimulated by the sympathetic nervous system with the interscapular BAT being innervated via branches of intercostal nerves. Whilst there is evidence to suggest that BAT possesses beta-3 adrenoceptors, no studies have identified the specific nerve branch that carries sympathetic innervation to BAT in humans. The aim of this study was to identify and trace the peripheral nerve or nerves that innervate human BAT in the supraclavicular region. The posterior triangle region of the neck of cadaveric specimens were dissected in order to identify any peripheral nerve branches piercing and/or terminating in supraclavicular BAT. A previously undescribed branch of the cervical plexus terminating in a supraclavicular adipose depot was identified in all specimens. This was typically an independent branch of the plexus, from the third cervical spinal nerve, but in one specimen was a branch of the supraclavicular nerve. Histological analysis revealed the supraclavicular adipose depot contained tyrosine hydroxylase immunoreactive structures, which likely represent sympathetic axons. This is the first study that identifies a nerve branch to supraclavicular BAT-like tissue. This finding opens new avenues for the investigation of neural regulation of fat metabolism in humans."
https://openalex.org/W3044624551,"Context A disease can be a source of disturbance, causing population declines or extirpations, altering species interactions, and affecting habitat structure. This is particularly relevant for diseases that affect keystone species or ecosystem engineers, leading to potentially cascading effects on ecosystems. Objective We investigated the invasion of a non-native disease, plague, to a keystone species, prairie dogs, and documented the resulting extent of fragmentation and habitat loss in western grasslands. Specifically, we assessed how the arrival of plague in the Conata Basin, South Dakota, United States, affected the size, shape, and aggregation of prairie dog colonies, an animal species known to be highly susceptible to plague. Methods Colonies in the prairie dog complex were mapped every 1 to 3 years from 1993 to 2015. Plague was first confirmed in 2008 and we compared prairie dog complex and colony characteristics before and after the arrival of plague. Results As expected the colony complex and the patches in colonies became smaller and more fragmented after the arrival of plague; the total area of each colony and the mean area per patch within a colony decreased, the number of patches per colony increased, and mean contiguity of each patch decreased, leading to habitat fragmentation. Conclusion We demonstrate how an emerging infectious disease can act as a source of disturbance to natural systems and lead to potentially permanent alteration of habitat characteristics. While perhaps not traditionally thought of as a source of ecosystem disturbances, in recent years emerging infectious diseases have shown to be able to have large effects on ecosystems if they affect keystone species."
https://openalex.org/W3043927732,"Background Clinical criteria for pertussis diagnosis and clinical case definitions for surveillance are based on a cough lasting two or more weeks. As several pertussis cases seek care earlier, a clinical tool independent of cough duration may support earlier recognition. We developed a data-driven algorithm aimed at predicting a laboratory confirmed pertussis. Methods We enrolled children <12 months of age presenting with apnoea, paroxistic cough, whooping, or post-tussive vomiting, irrespective of the duration of cough. Patients underwent a RT-PCR test for pertussis and other viruses. Through a logistic regression model, we identified symptoms associated with laboratory confirmed pertussis. We then developed a predictive decision tree through Quinlan's C4.5 algorithm to predict laboratory confirmed pertussis. Results We enrolled 543 children, of which 160 had a positive RT-PCR for pertussis. A suspicion of pertussis by a physician (aOR 5.44) or a blood count showing leukocytosis and lymphocytosis (aOR 4.48) were highly predictive of lab confirmed pertussis. An algorithm including a suspicion of pertussis by a physician, whooping, cyanosis and absence of fever was accurate (79.9%) and specific (94.0%) and had high positive and negative predictive values (PPV 76.3% NPV 80.7%). Conclusions An algorithm based on clinical symptoms, not including the duration of cough, is accurate and has high predictive values for lab confirmed pertussis. Such a tool may be useful in low resource settings where lab confirmation is unavailable, to guide differential diagnosis and clinical decisions. Algorithms may also be useful to improve surveillance for pertussis and anticipating classification of cases."
https://openalex.org/W3044089818,"Introduction Certain ABO blood types have been linked to cardiovascular disease, infection and cancers. The effect of recipient ABO blood group on patient and graft survival has not been studied in ABO-matched kidney transplantation. This study aims to determine the association between kidney transplant recipient ABO blood groups with patient and graft survival in Australian and New Zealand. Methods All Australian and New Zealand transplant recipients who received ABO-compatible primary kidney transplants between 1995–2016 were analysed using a de-identified dataset from the Australia and New Zealand Dialysis and Transplant (ANZDATA) Registry. Primary analysis was undertaken of recipient ABO blood group O versus non-O blood groups. The primary outcome was patient survival post kidney transplantation and the secondary outcome was death censored graft survival. Recipient age at first transplant, gender, ethnicity, body mass index, smoking status, vascular disease, presence of diabetes mellitus, chronic lung disease, primary kidney disease, donor source, donor age and gender, and era of transplants were included in the multivariate model as confounders. Results and conclusions On analysis of 15,523 kidney transplant recipients, blood group O was not associated with patient survival (hazard ratio (HR) 0.96, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.89–1.04) nor death censored graft survival (HR 0.97, 95% CI 0.89–1.05) compared to non-blood group O recipients. Competing risks analyses showed an increased risk of cancer-related mortality in blood group O recipients on univariate analyses (HR 1.18, 95% CI 1.01–1.37) however, this became insignificant on multivariate analyses. On secondary analyses, recipient blood group AB (4.11% participants) was associated with inferior death censored graft survival compared to those with blood group O (HR 1.24, 95% CI 1.02–1.50). Although recipient ABO blood groups were not associated with patient nor graft survival, differences in cause-specific mortality between individual blood groups cannot be excluded based on current analyses."
https://openalex.org/W3044244615,"Cell-substrate adhesion of the social amoeba Dictyostelium discoideum, a model organism often used for the study of chemotaxis, is non-specific and does not involve focal adhesion complexes. Therefore, micropatterned substrates where adherent Dictyostelium cells are constrained to designated microscopic regions are difficult to make. Here we present a micropatterning technique for Dictyostelium cells that relies on coating the substrate with an ∼1μm thick layer of polyethylene glycol (PEG) gel. We show that, when plated on a substrate with narrow parallel stripes of PEG-gel and glass, Dictyostelium cells nearly exclusive adhere to and migrate along the glass stripes, thus providing a model system to study one-dimensional migration of amoeboid cells. Surprisingly, we find substantial differences in the adhesion to PEG-gel and glass stripes between vegetative and developed cells and between two different axenic laboratory strains of Dictyostelium, AX2 and AX4. Even more surprisingly, we find that the distribution of Dictyostelium cells between PEG-gel and glass stripes is significantly affected by the expression of several fluorescent protein markers of the cytoskeleton. We carry out atomic force microscopy based single cell force spectroscopy measurements that confirm that the force of adhesion to PEG-gel substrate can be significantly different between vegetative and developed cells, AX2 and AX4 cells, and cells with and without fluorescent markers. Thus, the choice of parental background, the degree of development, and the expression of fluorescent protein markers can all have a profound effect on cell-substrate adhesion and should be considered when comparing migration of cells and when designing micropatterned substrates."

Investigation on the mechanisms how H. avenae perceives wheat roots is limited. Here, the attractiveness of root exudates from eight plant genotypes to H. avenae were evaluated on agar plates. Results showed that the attraction of H. avenae to the root exudates from the non-host Brachypodium distachyon variety Bd21-3 was the highest, approximately 50 infective second-stage juveniles (J2s) per plate, followed by that from three H. avenae-susceptible wheat varieties, Zhengmai9023, Yanmai84 and Xiangmai25, as well as the resistant one of Xinyuan958, whereas the lowest attractive activity was observed in the two H. avenae-resistant wheat varieties, Xianmai20 (approximately 12 J2s/plate) and Liangxing66 (approximately 11 J2s/plate). Then Bd21-3, Zhengmai9023 and Heng4399 were selected for further assays as their different attractiveness and resistance to H. avenae, and attractants for H. avenae in their root exudates were characterized to be heat-labile and low-molecular compounds (LM) by behavioral bioassay. Based on these properties of the attractants, a principle of identifying attractants for H. avenae was set up. Then LM of six root exudates from the three plants with and without heating were separated and analyzed by HPLC-MS. Finally, dihydroxyacetone (DHA), methylprednisolone succinate, embelin and diethylpropionin in the root exudates were identified to be putative attractants for H. avenae according to the principle, and the attraction of DHA to H. avenae was validated by behavioral bioassay on agar. Our study enhances the recognition to the orientation mechanism of H. avenae towards wheat roots."
https://openalex.org/W3044706528,"As urban areas expand around the world, there are growing efforts to restore and protect natural and agricultural systems for the multitude of ecosystem services they provide to urban communities. This study presents a researcher-farmer collaboration in a highly urbanized area of Oʻahu focused on understanding the historical and current challenges and opportunities faced by a culturally and socially valued spring-dependent urban farm, Sumida Farm, which produces the majority of the state of Hawaiʻi’s watercress. We conducted a long-term trend analysis (25 years) of factors identified by the farmers to be important historical drivers of crop yield, including groundwater pumping, pest outbreaks, temperature, Oceanic Niño Index, and precipitation. We combined this analysis with a year of intensive spring water sampling on the farm to evaluate nutrient and contaminant composition and flow to understand water-related stressors, as well as evaluate the potential of the farm to provide nutrient retention services. We found negative correlations between historical crop yields and increases in the Oceanic Niño Index, temperature thresholds, and pest outbreaks. Despite the surrounding urbanization, we found on-farm water quality to be very high, and microbial analyses revealed an abundance of denitrifiers (nirS gene) suggesting that the farm provides a nutrient retention service to downstream systems. Finally, we found that socio-cultural values including heritage value, aesthetic value, and educational value are increasingly important for the Sumida family and surrounding community. These socio-cultural benefits alongside highly valued local food production and nutrient retention services are essential for continued community and political support. Collectively, our study demonstrates that challenges facing urban agricultural systems shift through time, and that recognition of the beyond crop-yield benefits of these systems to urban communities is essential to their long-term survival."
https://openalex.org/W3045064729,"Despite readily availability of vaccines against both Hemophilus influenzae and Pneumococcus, pneumonia remains the most common cause of morbidity and mortality in children under the age of five years in Nepal. With growing antibiotic resistance and a general move towards more rational antibiotic use, early identification of clinical signs for the prediction of radiological pneumonia would help practitioners to start the treatment of patients. The main aim of this study was to reassess the clinical predictors of pneumonia in Nepal.This cross-sectional study was conducted between June 2015 and November 2015 at Tribhuvan University Teaching Hospital, a tertiary hospital in Kathmandu, Nepal. Children aged 3-60 months with a clinical diagnosis of pneumonia by a physician were enrolled in the study. Radiological pneumonia was identified and categorized as per World Health Organization guidelines by an experienced radiologist blinded to patient characteristics. We calculated sensitivity and specificity of clinical signs and symptoms for radiological pneumonia.Out of 1021 children with fever, 160 cases were clinically diagnosed as pneumonia and were enrolled for this study. Among the enrolled patients, 61% had radiological pneumonia. Tachypnea had the highest sensitivity of 99%, while bronchial breathing had the highest specificity of 100%. During univariate analysis, grunting, wheezing, nasal discharge, decreased breath sounds, noisy breathing and hypoxemia were associated with radiological pneumonia. Only hypoxemia remained an independent predictor when adjusted for all the factors.Tachypnea was the most sensitive sign, whereas bronchial breathing was most specific sign for radiological pneumonia."
https://openalex.org/W3045290585,"For patients with recurrent ovarian cancer, the goals of chemotherapy include palliation of disease-related symptoms with minimum treatment-related side effects. However, there is currently a paucity of data regarding the initiation of palliative chemotherapy. This study aimed to compare the differences in survival rates and toxicities between patients with recurrent ovarian cancer who started palliative chemotherapy immediately versus those who received delayed chemotherapy. Through a retrospective chart review, patients who received more than three lines of chemotherapy were included. Based on the timing of third-line chemotherapy initiation, the patients were divided into two groups: delayed (DTG) and immediate (ITG) treatment groups. The chi-square test or Fisher’s exact tests, and t-test or Mann-Whitney U test were used for comparing variables, as appropriate. The Kaplan-Meier method was used for survival analysis. P-value of <0.05 was considered significant. Although there was no statistically significant difference, the total number of regimens and cycles was lower in the DTG than in the ITG. No differences in toxicities and survival rates were observed between the two groups. Overall, survival and toxicity did not differ significantly between the two groups. In a palliative care setting, our findings suggest that delaying the treatment had no adverse effect on survival. Despite the lack of evidence of a survival benefit with aggressive treatment, patients chose to continue chemotherapy. Because recurrent ovarian cancer is a complex condition, patients require sufficient explanation and time to fully understand the costs and benefits related to aggressive chemotherapy."
https://openalex.org/W3044048777,"Determining the concentration of nucleic acids in biological samples precisely and reliably still is a challenge. In particular when only very small sample quantities are available for analysis, the established fluorescence-based methods give insufficient results. Photobleaching is seen as the main reason for this. In this paper we present a method to correct for the photobleaching effect. Using confocal microscopy with single molecule sensitivity, we derived calibration curves from DNA solutions with defined fragment length. We analyzed dilution series over a wide range of concentrations (1 pg/μl-1000 pg/μl) and measured their specific diffusion coefficients employing fluorescence correlation spectroscopy. Using this information, we corrected the measured fluorescence intensity of the calibration solutions for photobleaching effects. We evaluated our method by analyzing a series of DNA mixtures of varying composition. For fragments smaller than 1000 bp, our method allows to determine sample concentrations with high precision in very small sample quantities (< 2 μl with concentrations < 20 pg/μl). Once the technical parameters are determined and remain stable in an established process, our improved calibration method will make measuring molecular biological samples of unknown sequence composition more efficient, accurate and sample-saving than previous methods."
https://openalex.org/W3044937004,"Degeneration of the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) plays a central role in age-related macular degeneration (AMD). Throughout life, RPE cells are challenged by a variety of cytotoxic stressors, some of which are cumulative with age and may ultimately contribute to drusen and lipofuscin accumulation. Stressors such as these continually damage RPE cells resulting in a state of chronic wounding. Current cell-based platforms that model a state of chronic RPE cell wounding are limited, and the RPE cellular response is not entirely understood. Here, we used the electric cell-substrate impedance sensing (ECIS) system to induce a state of acute or chronic wounding on differentiated human fetal RPE cells to analyze changes in the wound repair response. RPE cells surrounding the lesioned area employ both cell migration and proliferation to repair wounds but fail to reestablish their original cell morphology or density after repetitive wounding. Chronically wounded RPE cells develop phenotypic AMD characteristics such as loss of cuboidal morphology, enlarged size, and multinucleation. Transcriptomic analysis suggests a systemic misregulation of RPE cell functions in bystander cells, which are not directly adjacent to the wound. Genes associated with the major RPE cell functions (LRAT, MITF, RDH11) significantly downregulate after wounding, in addition to differential expression of genes associated with the cell cycle (CDK1, CDC6, CDC20), inflammation (IL-18, CCL2), and apoptosis (FAS). Interestingly, repetitive wounding resulted in prolonged misregulation of genes, including FAS, LRAT, and PEDF. The use of ECIS to induce wounding resulted in an over-representation of AMD-associated genes among those dysregulated genes, particularly genes associated with advanced AMD. This simple system provides a new model for further investigation of RPE cell wound response in AMD pathogenesis."
