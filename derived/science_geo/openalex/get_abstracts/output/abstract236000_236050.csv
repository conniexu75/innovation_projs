https://openalex.org/W2160571481,"The first global assessment of amphibians provides new context for the well-publicized phenomenon of amphibian declines. Amphibians are more threatened and are declining more rapidly than either birds or mammals. Although many declines are due to habitat loss and overutilization, other, unidentified processes threaten 48% of rapidly declining species and are driving species most quickly to extinction. Declines are nonrandom in terms of species' ecological preferences, geographic ranges, and taxonomic associations and are most prevalent among Neotropical montane, stream-associated species. The lack of conservation remedies for these poorly understood declines means that hundreds of amphibian species now face extinction."
https://openalex.org/W2007078899,"Obesity contributes to the development of type 2 diabetes, but the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. Using cell culture and mouse models, we show that obesity causes endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. This stress in turn leads to suppression of insulin receptor signaling through hyperactivation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and subsequent serine phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1). Mice deficient in X-box-binding protein-1 (XBP-1), a transcription factor that modulates the ER stress response, develop insulin resistance. These findings demonstrate that ER stress is a central feature of peripheral insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes at the molecular, cellular, and organismal levels. Pharmacologic manipulation of this pathway may offer novel opportunities for treating these common diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2106600012,"When humans are offered the choice between rewards available at different points in time, the relative values of the options are discounted according to their expected delays until delivery. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging, we examined the neural correlates of time discounting while subjects made a series of choices between monetary reward options that varied by delay to delivery. We demonstrate that two separate systems are involved in such decisions. Parts of the limbic system associated with the midbrain dopamine system, including paralimbic cortex, are preferentially activated by decisions involving immediately available rewards. In contrast, regions of the lateral prefrontal cortex and posterior parietal cortex are engaged uniformly by intertemporal choices irrespective of delay. Furthermore, the relative engagement of the two systems is directly associated with subjects' choices, with greater relative fronto-parietal activity when subjects choose longer term options."
https://openalex.org/W1992545229,"Adsorption and desorption of hydrogen from nanoporous materials, such as activated carbon, is usually fully reversible. We have prepared nanoporous metal-organic framework materials with flexible linkers in which the pore openings, as characterized in the static structures, appear to be too small to allow H 2 to pass. We observe hysteresis in their adsorption and desorption kinetics above the supercritical temperature of H 2 that reflects the dynamical opening of the “windows” between pores. This behavior would allow H 2 to be adsorbed at high pressures but stored at lower pressures."
https://openalex.org/W2053138397,"Is calculation possible without language? Or is the human ability for arithmetic dependent on the language faculty? To clarify the relation between language and arithmetic, we studied numerical cognition in speakers of Mundurukú, an Amazonian language with a very small lexicon of number words. Although the Mundurukú lack words for numbers beyond 5, they are able to compare and add large approximate numbers that are far beyond their naming range. However, they fail in exact arithmetic with numbers larger than 4 or 5. Our results imply a distinction between a nonverbal system of number approximation and a language-based counting system for exact number and arithmetic."
https://openalex.org/W2004107819,"Long-term memory is thought to be mediated by protein synthesis-dependent, late-phase long-term potentiation (L-LTP). Two secretory proteins, tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), have been implicated in this process, but their relationship is unclear. Here we report that tPA, by activating the extracellular protease plasmin, converts the precursor proBDNF to the mature BDNF (mBDNF), and that such conversion is critical for L-LTP expression in mouse hippocampus. Moreover, application of mBDNF is sufficient to rescue L-LTP when protein synthesis is inhibited, which suggests that mBDNF is a key protein synthesis product for L-LTP expression."
https://openalex.org/W2003799941,"We recently reported the discovery and preliminary characterization of Mimivirus, the largest known virus, with a 400-nanometer particle size comparable to mycoplasma. Mimivirus is a double-stranded DNA virus growing in amoebae. We now present its 1,181,404–base pair genome sequence, consisting of 1262 putative open reading frames, 10% of which exhibit a similarity to proteins of known functions. In addition to exceptional genome size, Mimivirus exhibits many features that distinguish it from other nucleocytoplasmic large DNA viruses. The most unexpected is the presence of numerous genes encoding central protein-translation components, including four amino-acyl transfer RNA synthetases, peptide release factor 1, translation elongation factor EF-TU, and translation initiation factor 1. The genome also exhibits six tRNAs. Other notable features include the presence of both type I and type II topoisomerases, components of all DNA repair pathways, many polysaccharide synthesis enzymes, and one intein-containing gene. The size and complexity of the Mimivirus genome challenge the established frontier between viruses and parasitic cellular organisms. This new sequence data might help shed a new light on the origin of DNA viruses and their role in the early evolution of eukaryotes."
https://openalex.org/W2033416159,"Thermodynamic, x-ray diffraction, and Raman and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy measurements show that clusters of H 2 can be stabilized and stored at low pressures in a sII binary clathrate hydrate. Clusters of H 2 molecules occupy small water cages, whereas large water cages are singly occupied by tetrahydrofuran. The presence of this second guest component stabilizes the clathrate at pressures of 5 megapascals at 279.6 kelvin, versus 300 megapascals at 280 kelvin for pure H 2 hydrate."
https://openalex.org/W2063782051,"Subjective judgments, an essential information source for science and policy, are problematic because there are no public criteria for assessing judgmental truthfulness. I present a scoring method for eliciting truthful subjective data in situations where objective truth is unknowable. The method assigns high scores not to the most common answers but to the answers that are more common than collectively predicted, with predictions drawn from the same population. This simple adjustment in the scoring criterion removes all bias in favor of consensus: Truthful answers maximize expected score even for respondents who believe that their answer represents a minority view."

https://openalex.org/W2145718464,"Topical agents, such as microbicides, that can protect against human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) transmission are urgently needed. Using a chimeric simian/human immunodeficiency virus (SHIV SF162), which is tropic for the chemokine receptor CCR5, we report that topical application of high doses of PSC-RANTES, an amino terminus–modified analog of the chemokine RANTES, provided potent protection against vaginal challenge in rhesus macaques. These experimental findings have potentially important implications for understanding vaginal transmission of HIV and the design of strategies for its prevention."
https://openalex.org/W2022218113,"Phosphorylation of NF-κB p65(RelA) serine 536 is physiologically induced in response to a variety of proinflammatory stimuli, but the responsible pathways have not been conclusively unraveled, and the function of this phosphorylation is largely elusive. In contrast to previous studies, we found no evidence for a role of c-Jun N-terminal kinase, p38 kinase, extracellular signal-regulated kinase, or phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase in interleukin-1- or tumor necrosis factor-induced Ser-536 phosphorylation, as revealed by pharmacological inhibitors. We were not able to suppress Ser-536 phosphorylation by either RNA interference directed at IκB kinase (IKK)-α/β (the best characterized Ser-536 kinases so far) or the IKKβ inhibitor SC-514 or dominant negative mutants of either IKK. A green fluorescent protein p65 fusion protein was phosphorylated at Ser-536 in the absence of IKK activation, suggesting the existence of IKKα/β-independent Ser-536 kinases. Chromatographic fractionation of cell extracts allowed the identification of two distinct enzymatic activities phosphorylating Ser-536. Peak 1 represents an unknown kinase, whereas peak 2 contained IKKα, IKKβ, IKKϵ, and TBK1. Overexpressed IKKϵ and TBK1 phosphorylate Ser-536 in vivo and in vitro. Reconstitution of mutant p65 proteins in p65-deficient fibroblasts that either mimicked phosphorylation (S536D) or preserved a predicted hydrogen bond between Ser-536 and Asp-533 (S536N) revealed that phosphorylation of Ser-536 favors interleukin-8 transcription mediated by TATA-binding protein-associated factor II31, a component of TFIID. In the absence of phosphorylation, the hydrogen bond favors binding of the corepressor amino-terminal enhancer of split to the p65 terminal transactivation domain. Collectively, our results provide evidence for at least five kinases that converge on Ser-536 of p65 and a novel function for this phosphorylation site in the recruitment of components of the basal transcriptional machinery to the interleukin-8 promoter.

The transcription factor NF-κB regulates the expression of a large number of genes with important functions in the immune response, inflammation, cellular stress reactions, carcinogenesis, and apoptosis. In resting cells NF-κB is trapped in the cytoplasm by its interaction with the inhibitor IκB.

A further study showed that the LPS- and TNF-induced phosphorylation of endogenous p65 at Ser-536 is unaffected in IKKα -/- fibroblasts. Only the LPS-induced but not the TNF-induced phosphorylation is lost in IKKβ -/- cells (21Yang F. Tang E. Guan K. Wang C.Y. J. Immunol. 2003; 170: 5630-5635Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar).In the light of these contrasting findings and the apparent complexity of p65 regulation by phosphorylation, we have set up experiments to analyze more conclusively the kinases that contribute to Ser-536 phosphorylation of p65 and its function in response to one of the major activators of p65, interleukin-1. We report here that besides IKKα and IKKβ, the IKK-related kinases TBK1 and IKKϵ also phosphorylate Ser-536. We also provide evidence for a novel Ser-536 kinase. Further experiments into the mechanism by which Ser-536 contributes to p65 function suggest that phosphorylation disrupts a hydrogen bond between Ser-536 and Asp-533. As a result, p65 has a lower affinity for the corepressor AES and can interact efficiently with TAFII31, a component of the basal transcription factor machinery, to induce transcription of IL-8, a known p65 target gene. We, thus, identify a hitherto unknown mechanism of p65-mediated gene regulation.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCells and Materials—HeLa cells stably expressing the tet transactivator protein and HEK293 cells stably expressing the IL-1 receptor (HEK293IL-1R) were kind gifts of H.

Equal amounts of plasmid DNA within each experiment were obtained by adding empty vector. For determination of promoter activity, cells (seeded at 5 × 105 per well of 6-well plates) were transfected with 0.25 μg of the IL-8-promoter luciferase reporter plasmids and 0.5 μg of pSV-β-gal. β-Galactosidase activity was determined (using reagents from Clontech) to allow normalization of luciferase activity in different transfections. p65 -/- cells were seeded in 6-well plates and transfected using Rotifect (Roth) according to the manufacturer's instructions.Site-directed Mutagenesis—All mutations were performed by a quick change site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) according to the manufacturer's protocol and verified by DNA sequencing on an ABI Prism 310 instrument.siRNA Experiments—Cells were seeded in 24-well plates at 6.5 × 104 cells/ml. At 70% confluency cells were washed 2× in serum-free medium and transfected with a total of 200 nm of a mixture of four double-stranded RNA oligonucleotides directed against human IKKα and IKKβ (Smart Pool, Dharmakon) using 3 μl of Oligofectamine per well. After 72 h cells were treated as indicated and lysed, and protein expression was determined by Western blot. The sequences of the luciferase siRNA oligonucleotides used as a control were as follows (5′-GGCCUUGUGAACAGAUCAGdTdT-3′, 5′-CUGAUCUGUUCACAAGGCCdTdT-3′).Anion Exchange Chromatography—Four T175-cm2 flasks of HeLa cells were stimulated or left untreated as indicated in the figure legend. Cells were washed in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and resuspended in 20 mm Tris, pH 8.5, 20 mm β-glycerophosphate, 20 mm NaF, 0.1 mm Na3VO4, 0.5 mm EGTA, 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 10 μm E64, 2.5 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μm pepstatin, and 400 nm okadaic acid. Cells were broken mechanically by passage three times through a 26-gauge needle. Then the lysate was cleared at 15,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. Supernatants were stored frozen at -80 °C or directly used for chromatography. 4.75 mg of lysate was diluted into 2.5 ml of buffer A (20 mm Tris, pH 8.5, 20 mm β-glycerophosphate, 20 mm NaF, 0.1 mm Na3VO4, 0.5 mm EGTA, 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.05% Nonidet P-40, 2 mm dithiothreitol) and loaded onto a 1 ml of ResQ column run by an Aktaprime system (Amersham Biosciences). The column was equilibrated in buffer A, and proteins were eluted with a linear salt gradient (0-0.75 m NaCl in 16 ml). 1-ml fractions were collected and stored frozen at -80 °C until further use.Preparation of Cell Extracts—For the preparation of whole cell extracts cells were lysed directly in SDS sample buffer. DNA was sheared by brief sonification, and soluble proteins were recovered after centrifugation of lysates at 15,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. For in vitro kinase assays, cells were lysed in 10 mm Tris, pH 7.05, 30 mm NaPPi, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 2 mm Na3VO4, 50 mm NaF, 20 mm β-glycerophosphate, and freshly added 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.5 μg/ml leupeptin, 0.5 μg/ml pepstatin, and 400 nm okadaic acid. After 10 min on ice, lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C.Nuclear and cytosolic extracts were prepared as described previously (31Nourbakhsh M. Kalble S.

Protein concentration of cell extracts was determined by the method of Bradford, and samples were stored at -80 °C.Western Blotting—Cell extract proteins were separated on 10% SDS-PAGE and electrophoretically transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Immobilon®, Millipore). After blocking with 5% dried milk in Tris-buffered saline overnight, membranes were incubated for 4-24 h with primary antibodies, washed in Tris-buffered saline, and incubated for 2-4 h with the peroxidase-coupled secondary antibody. Proteins were detected by using the Amersham Biosciences-enhanced chemiluminescence system.In Vitro Kinase Assays—For immune complex kinase assays 500 μg of cell extract protein was diluted in 500 μl of ice-cold immunoprecipitation (IP) buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 7.05, 30 mm NaPPi, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 2 mm Na3VO4, 50 mm NaF, 20 mm β-glycerophosphate, 2 mm dithiothreitol, and 400 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Samples were incubated for 3 h with 1 μg of antibodies against IKKα or FLAG (to precipitate FLAG-IKKϵ or FLAG-TBK1) followed by the addition of 20 μl of a 50% suspension of protein A- or G-Sepharose beads and incubation for 1-2 h at 4 °C. Beads were spun down, washed 3× in 1 ml of IP buffer A, and resuspended in 10 μl of the same buffer.Then 1 μg of recombinant protein substrates (GST-p65-(354-551) or mutants thereof) in 10 μl of H2O and 10 μl of kinase buffer (150 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 30 mm MgCl2, 60 μm ATP, 4 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP) were added. After 30 min at room temperature SDS-PAGE sample buffer was added, and proteins were eluted from the beads by boiling for 5 min. After centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 5 min, supernatants were separated on 10% or 12.5% SDS-PAGE. Phosphorylated proteins were visualized by autoradiography.Alternatively, 10 μl of ResQ fractions were used in the kinase reactions. For the kinase assay shown in Fig. 4A, 10 μl of cell lysate (50 μg of protein) was added to the kinase reaction, and the in vitro phosphorylated GST-p65 fusion protein was purified on GSH-Sepharose before SDS-PAGE and autoradiography as described in Holtmann et al.

For the kinase assays shown in Fig. 6A, 10 μl (50 μg) of cytosolic or nuclear proteins were mixed with 10 μl of (150 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 30 mm MgCl2, 600 μm ATP) and 10 μl (1 μg) of GST-p65-(354-551) fusion proteins for 15 min at 30 °C. Reaction mixtures were separated by SDS-PAGE, and phosphorylation of p65 was detected by immunoblotting with the anti-phospho-Ser-536 antibody.Fig. 6p65 phosphorylated at Ser-536 occurs in the nucleus and is recruited to the endogenous IL-8 promoter. A, HeLa cells were stimulated for 10 min with IL-1 (10 ng/ml) or left untreated. Nuclear and cytosolic extracts were prepared, and activity of kinases that phosphorylate GST-p65-(354-551) or a version in which Ser-536 was mutated to alanine (S536A) was determined by in vitro kinase assay. Phosphorylation of Ser-536 was detected by immunoblotting of reaction mixtures, and the blot membrane was reprobed with anti-p65 antibodies to confirm equal loading. Lanes 9 and 10 contained only GST-p65 fusion proteins without cell extracts. B, HeLa cells were stimulated for the indicated times with IL-1 (10 ng/ml) or left untreated. Nuclear extracts were analyzed for p65 and Ser-536 phosphorylation of p65 by Western blotting. C, nuclear extracts from unstimulated HeLa cells or cells stimulated for 10 min with IL-1 (10 ng/ml) were incubated with a 32P-labeled oligonucleotide containing a consensus NF-κB binding site in the presence or absence of antibodies against p65 or phospho-Ser-536 of p65. Solid arrows indicate the two IL-1-induced protein-DNA complexes, and open arrows indicate forms of these complexes supershifted by the antibodies. D, KB cells were stimulated for the indicated times with IL-1 (10 ng/ml) or left untreated. After in vivo cross-linking soluble chromatin was prepared, and antibodies against p65 and phospho-Ser-536 of p65 were used to immunoprecipitate protein-DNA complexes. IL-8 promoter DNA bound to p65 was amplified by PCR from the immune complexes, separated by agarose gel electrophoresis, and visualized by ethidium bromide staining.

Approximately 500 ng of purified GST, GST-AES, or GST-TAFII31 (as judged from Coomassie-stained gels) were immobilized on GSH-Sepharose, resuspended in 70 μl of binding buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 0.3 m NaCl, 1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), and incubated with 3.5 μl of in vitro translated p65 or AES proteins for 60 min at 30 °C. Beads were spun down and washed twice in binding buffer without bovine serum albumin, and bound proteins were eluted in SDS sample buffer for 5 min at 95 °C. Bound proteins and 110 of the in vitro translated proteins (used as input control) were separated on SDS-PAGE, and proteins were analyzed by autoradiography or Western blotting.Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP)—Proteins bound to DNA were cross-linked in vivo by replacement of the medium with warm phosphate-buffered saline including 1% formaldehyde. After 1 min, this solution was replaced by warm phosphate-buffered saline including 0.125 m glycine to stop cross-linking. Cells were washed, collected, and lysed in ChIP-radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1% deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 1 mm EDTA, and freshly added 1% aprotinin). Lysates were cleared by sonification (4× 1 min on ice) followed by centrifugation at 15,000 × g at 4 °C for 20 min. 4-10 μl of antibodies were added to 250-500 μl of lysates, and the mixture was rotated at 4 °C overnight.

https://openalex.org/W2099409750,"The apparent biotic affinities between the mainland and the island in the Western Ghats–Sri Lanka biodiversity hotspot have been interpreted as the result of frequent migrations during recent periods of low sea level. We show, using molecular phylogenies of two invertebrate and four vertebrate groups, that biotic interchange between these areas has been much more limited than hitherto assumed. Despite several extended periods of land connection during the past 500,000 years, Sri Lanka has maintained a fauna that is largely distinct from that of the Indian mainland. Future conservation programs for the subcontinent should take into account such patterns of local endemism at the finest scale at which they may occur."
https://openalex.org/W2036575025,"The requirement for the serine/threonine protein kinase ATM in coordinating the cellular response to DNA damage induced by ionizing radiation has been studied extensively. Many of the anti-tumor chemotherapeutics in clinical use today cause DNA double strand breaks; however, few have been evaluated for their ability to modulate ATM-mediated pathways. We have investigated the requirement for ATM in the cellular response to doxorubicin, a topoisomerase II-stabilizing drug. Using several ATM-proficient and ATM-deficient cell lines, we have observed ATM-dependent nuclear accumulation of p53 and ATM-dependent phosphorylation of p53 on seven serine residues. This was accompanied by an increased binding of p53 to its cognate binding site, suggesting transcriptional competency of p53 to activate its downstream effectors. Treatment of cells with doxorubicin led to the phosphorylation of histone H2AX on serine 139 with dependence on ATM for the initial response. Doxorubicin treatment also stimulated ATM autophosphorylation on serine 1981 and the ATM-dependent phosphorylation of numerous effectors in the ATM-signaling pathway, including Nbs1 (Ser343), SMC1 (Ser957), Chk1 (Ser317 and Ser345), and Chk2 (Ser33/35 and Thr68). Although generally classified as a topoisomerase II-stabilizing drug that induces DNA double strand breaks, doxorubicin can intercalate DNA and generate reactive oxygen species. Pretreatment of cells with the superoxide scavenger ascorbic acid had no effect on the doxorubicin-induced phosphorylation and accumulation of p53. In contrast, preincubation of cells with the hydroxyl radical scavenger, N-acetylcysteine, significantly attenuated the doxorubicin-mediated phosphorylation and accumulation of p53, p53-DNA binding, and the phosphorylation of H2AX, Nbs1, SMC1, Chk1, and Chk2, suggesting that hydroxyl radicals contribute to the doxorubicin-induced activation of ATM-dependent pathways."

This can lead to arsenic contamination of drinking water supplies and deleterious consequences for human health. Using molecular genetics, we show that the functional gene for As(V) respiration, arrA , is highly conserved; that it is required for As(V) reduction to arsenite when arsenic is sorbed onto iron minerals; and that it can be used to identify the presence and activity of As(V)-respiring bacteria in arsenic-contaminated iron-rich sediments. The expression of arrA thus can be used to monitor sites in which As(V)-respiring bacteria may be controlling arsenic geochemistry."
https://openalex.org/W2028889984,"Gene expression in eukaryotes is normally believed to be controlled by transcriptional regulators that activate genes encoding structural proteins and enzymes. To identify previously unrecognized DNA binding activities, a yeast proteome microarray was screened with DNA probes; Arg5,6, a well-characterized mitochondrial enzyme involved in arginine biosynthesis, was identified. Chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments revealed that Arg5,6 is associated with specific nuclear and mitochondrial loci in vivo, and Arg5,6 binds to specific fragments in vitro. Deletion of Arg5,6 causes altered transcript levels of both nuclear and mitochondrial target genes. These results indicate that metabolic enzymes can directly regulate eukaryotic gene expression."

We show that the S4 segment is located at the protein/lipid interface, with most of its charges protected from the lipid environment. Structurally, S4 is highly dynamic and is separated into two short helices by a flexible linker. Accessibility and dynamics data indicate that the S1 segment is surrounded by other parts of the protein. We propose that S1 is at the contact interface between the voltage-sensing and pore domains. These results establish the general principles of voltage-dependent channel structure in a biological membrane."

The research findings indicate that, whether or not humans have an extensive counting list, they share with nonverbal animals a language-independent representation of number, with limited, scale-invariant precision. What causal role, then, does knowledge of the language of counting serve? We consider the strong Whorfian proposal, that of linguistic determinism; the weak Whorfian hypothesis, that language influences how we think; and that the “language of thought” maps to spoken language or symbol systems."
https://openalex.org/W2014716705,"Protease-activated receptor-2 (PAR-2) is activated by trypsin-like serine proteases and can promote cell migration through an ERK1/2-dependent pathway, involving formation of a scaffolding complex at the leading edge of the cell. Previous studies also showed that expression of a dominant negative fragment of β-arrestin-1 reduces PAR-2-stimulated internalization, ERK1/2 activation, and cell migration; however, this reagent may block association of many proteins, including β-arrestin-2 with clathrin-coated pits. Here we investigate the role of PAR-2 in the constitutive migration of a metastatic breast cancer cell line, MDA MB-231, and use small interfering RNA to determine the contribution of each β-arrestin to this process. We demonstrate that a trypsin-like protease secreted from MDA MB-231 cells can promote cell migration through autocrine activation of PAR-2 and this correlates with constitutive localization of PAR-2, β-arrestin-2, and activated ERK1/2 to pseudopodia. Addition of MEK-1 inhibitors, trypsin inhibitors, a scrambled PAR-2 peptide, and silencing of β-arrestins with small interfering RNA also reduce base-line migration of MDA MB-231 cells. In contrast, a less metastatic PAR-2 expressing breast cancer cell line does not exhibit constitutive migration, pseudopodia formation, or trypsin secretion; in these cells PAR-2 is more uniformly distributed around the cell periphery. These data demonstrate a requirement for both β-arrestins in PAR-2-mediated motility and suggest that autocrine activation of PAR-2 by secreted proteases may contribute to the migration of metastatic tumor cells through β-arrestin-dependent ERK1/2 activation.

A number of PAR-2-mediated events, including activation of ERK1/2 and cell migration are blocked by expression of a dominant negative fragment of β-arrestin-1 that encodes the clathrin binding domain (12DeFea K.A.

However, the specificity of this reagent is unclear as it acts by binding β-arrestin contact sites on clathrin and may affect other clathrin-regulated processes as well. In recent studies, we demonstrated that PAR-2 promotes chemotaxis by a mechanism involving localization of activated ERK1/2 and its upstream regulatory kinases to the pseudopodia. This pseudopodial localization appears to occur through the formation of a scaffolding complex containing β-arrestin(s) that we refer to as an endosomal scaffold (12DeFea K.A. Zalevsky J. Thoma M.S.

While β-arrestins were originally thought to mediate signal termination, there has been a growing body of evidence that they can also serve as signaling scaffolds for a number of receptors (14Luttrell L.M. Roudabush F.L. Choy E.W. Miller W.E. Field M.E. Pierce K.L. Lefkowitz R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 2449-2454Crossref PubMed Scopus (699) Google Scholar, 15McDonald P.H. Chow C.W.

Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 139-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar) and that further functional differences exist between the two β-arrestin family members. Recent studies using siRNA to specifically knockdown either β-arrestin-1 or 2 suggest that β2AR primarily utilizes β-arrestin-2 for internalization, while the angiotensin II type 1a receptor (AT1aR) can use either for internalization but requires β-arrestin-2 for signaling to ERK1/2 (17Ahn S.

Additional differences may exist between other cell types and receptors. The role of β-arrestins in cell migration is supported by genetic studies demonstrating impaired CXCR-mediated motility in lymphocytes from β-arrestin-2 knock-out mice (18Fong A.M. Premont R.T.

However, the specific β-arrestin family member(s) that mediate(s) PAR-2-promoted cell motility has not been investigated nor has the role of β-arrestins in tumor cell migration. The purpose of these studies was 2-fold. First, using siRNA to specifically knockdown each β-arrestin, we wished to determine which β-arrestins mediate ERK1/2 activation and chemotaxis downstream of PAR-2. Second, using the metastatic breast cancer cells (MDA MB-231) that migrate constitutively and cells with low metastatic potential (MDA MB-468) (19Zhang R.D. Fidler I.J. Price J.E.

Antibody dilutions for Western blotting were as follows: pERK (1:2000), ERK1/2 (1:2000), PAR-2 (SAM11, 1:250), β-arrestin-1/2 (1: 100), phospho-Raf (1:1000), total Raf (1:1000), total ERK1 (1:1000), and histone (1:250). Cell Culture—MDA MB-231 and MDA MB-468 cells were grown in Leibowitz's L15 medium, supplemented with 14 mm NaHCO3 and 10% fetal calf serum and maintained at 37 °C, 5% CO2. Microscopy—Cells were seeded onto collagen-coated coverslips for 6 h and serum-starved overnight. Protease inhibitor mixture (PIC: 100 μm leupeptin, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, 6.25 μg/ml α1-antitrypsin, and 0.5 mm 4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluoride hydrochloride (AEBSF)) or hAP were added for 5–90 min as described, and cells were then fixed in normal buffered formalin followed by pressure cooker antigen retrieval in 1% sodium citrate and stained with anti-B5 (1:500) overnight and Alexa-595 conjugated secondary. Serial sections (1 μm, 40× and 100× objectives) were taken on a Zeiss LSM510 microscope. For images in Fig. 2C, images were taken with a 2.5× zoom. For video microscopy, MDA MB231 cells were observed by phase contrast microscopy in bicarbonate-free medium on a Nikkon Inverted microscope (40× objective), and time-lapse images were taken every 2 min using Metamorph software. A quicktime video with 1.0-s delays (2 s delays indicate addition of PIC and AP) is included in the supplemental material. siRNA Transfections—Chemically synthesized double-stranded siRNA (β-arrestin-1, 5′-AAAGCCUUCUGCGCGGAGAAU-3′; β-arrestin-2, 5′-AAGGACCGCAAAGUGUUUGUG-3′; β-arrestin-1 and -2, 5′-ACCTGCGCCTTCCGCTATG-3′; control (non-targeting sequence), 5′-AAUUCUCCGAACGUGUCACGU-3′) with 19-nucleotide duplex RNA and 2-nucleotide 3′-dT overhangs were purchased from Xeragon (Germantown, MD) in deprotected and desalted form. Cells (40–50% confluent) were transfected with 20 μg/10-cm dish of siRNA, using Genesilencer. For pERK studies, cells were seeded into 6-well dishes 48 h after siRNA transfection and serum-starved overnight prior to stimulation. For chemotaxis assays, cells were serum-starved for 16 h and split into trans-well chambers 48 h after siRNA transfection. Chemotaxis Assays and Pseudopodia Purification—For all migration and pseudopodia purification assays, cells were serum-starved overnight in 0.1% bovine serum albumin then seeded onto collagen (10 μg/ml)-coated 12-mm Transwell filters with 8-μm pores for migration (104/filter) and 3-μm pores for pseudopodia purification (105/filter). Agonists (trypsin, AP, or 2f-AP) were added to the bottom chamber, and migrated cells or pseudopodia and cell bodies were analyzed as described previously (13Ge L. Ly Y. Hollenberg M. DeFea K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 34418-34426Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). For inhibitor experiments, a mixture of serine protease inhibitors (PIC), 1 μg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor (SBTI), 2 μg/ml leupeptin or 2 μg/ml aprotinin, 0–100 μm 2-furoyl-ILRGL-O, or 10 μm PD98059 was added to the top chamber after cells attached for 2 h and migration monitored as described previously. Subcellular Fractionation—5 × 105 cells/60-mm dish (grown 24 h) were serum-starved for 16 h, treated with 50 μm AP for 0–60 min at 37 °C, washed twice, lysed by Dounce homogenization (10 strokes) in 0.25 ml of hypotonic lysis buffer, and fractionated as described previously (13Ge L. Ly Y. Hollenberg M. DeFea K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 34418-34426Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Quantification of band densities was performed using Adobe Photoshop, and pERK band densities were normalized to total ERK band densities for each lane. Trypsin Secretion—At the start of the experiment 3 ml of fresh medium was added to cells (80% confluent) and samples were collected for 5–90 min. Protein was concentrated by chloroform/MeOH extraction and analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblotting with antitrypsin/trypsinogen. To estimate quantities of trypsin(ogen), 1 μg of purified trypsin was included, and band densities were compared with purified trypsin using Adobe Photoshop histogram analysis. Statistics—All graphs and statistical analyses were performed using Kaleidagraph Version 3.5.1 or Graphpad Prism, Version 3.5. Migration assays and phospho-ERK analyses were performed a minimum of three times. Analysis of variance and Tukey t tests were used to determine statistical significance and significant differences of values. PAR-2 Mediates Base-line Migration in Metastatic MDA MB-231 Cells—To investigate the possible contribution of PAR-2 in tumor cell invasion, we compared the base-line and PAR-2-stimulated migration through collagen in MDA MB-231 and the less metastatic MDA MB-468 cells. We have observed that PAR-2 stimulates migration in a variety of tumor cells but have chosen these two for comparison because MDA MB-231 cells exhibited the highest, while MDA MB-468 cells exhibited the lowest, base-line migration and trypsin secretion of the cell lines tested. Consistent with their higher metastatic potential, the total number of invasive cells was 16 ± 3-fold greater in unstimulated MDA MB-231 cells than in the MDA MB-468 cells (Fig. 1A). Addition of PAR-2 activating peptide (hAP) or trypsin (T) to the bottom chamber filter resulted in a 1.5 ± 0.2- and 1.4 ± 0.25-fold increase in MDA MB-231 cell migration and a 15 ± 3-fold increase and 14.6 ± 0.5-fold increase in MDA MB-468 cell migration, respectively. Previous studies demonstrated that PAR-2 agonists are chemotactic, as a uniform concentration is less effective than a gradient (added to the bottom chamber only) at eliciting a migratory response (13Ge L. Ly Y. Hollenberg M. DeFea K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 34418-34426Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). To investigate whether the high basal level of MDA MB-231 cell migration was mediated by PAR-2, we first determined invasion in the presence of a scrambled PAR-2 peptide; peptides containing a scrambled tethered ligand sequence have been demonstrated to partially inhibit PAR-2 activation (11McGuire J.J. Saifeddine M. Triggle C.R. Sun K. Hollenberg M.D. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2004; 309: 1124-1131Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 21Al Ani B. Saifeddine M. Wijesuriya S.J. Hollenberg M.D. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2002; 300: 702-708Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). scr-AP inhibited basal MDA MB-231 cell migration by 55 ± 10% reduction (Fig. 1B), suggesting that constitutive PAR-2 activation contributes to their migratory behavior. To address the hypothesis that constitutive PAR-2 activation might be due to the presence of serine protease activity in the medium, we investigated the effects of a protease inhibitor mixture (PIC, see “Experimental Procedures” for description) or individual protease inhibitors on MDA MB-231 cell migration. To rule out the possible role of thrombin receptors, we included the thrombin inhibitor, hirudin. PIC and SBTI inhibited basal MDA MB-231 cell migration by 46 ± 5% and 50 ± 22%, respectively, while leupeptin and aprotinin alone had no effect (Fig. 1C). Hirudin addition caused a mild increase in MDA MB-231 migration, consistent with reported observations in this cell line showing that PAR-1 inhibition of PAR-2 induced cell migration (3Kamath L. Meydani A. Foss F. Kuliopulos A. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 5933-5940PubMed Google Scholar). To demonstrate that PAR-2 was responsible for the protease-mediated motility and that the protease inhibitors were not cytotoxic, we added hAP (SLIGKV) or 2f-AP in the presence of PIC. 2f-AP is a recently described synthetic PAR-2 agonist that achieves the same response as APs at nanomolar rather than micromolar concentrations (11McGuire J.J. Saifeddine M. Triggle C.R. Sun K. Hollenberg M.D. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2004; 309: 1124-1131Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). hAP and 2f-AP restored cell migration to 101 ± 5% and 180 ± 10% of basal in PIC-treated cells (Fig. 1C), suggesting that constitutive proteolytic cleavage of PAR-2 strongly contributes to the migratory behavior of MDA MB-231 cells. PIC did not block PAR-2-stimulated migration in MDA MB-468 cells (data not shown), further confirming that the inhibitors were not cytotoxic. Consistent with the inhibitory effects of PIC on MDA MB-231 cell migration, addition of PIC to MDA MB-231 cells results in retraction of cell processes and subsequent addition of hAP results in their membrane ruffling and filipodia extension (Fig. 1D and supplemental video 1). Previous studies showed that MEK1 inhibitors and expression of a dominant negative ERK2 inhibit PAR-2-stimulated migration in NIH3T3 and MDA MB-468 cells (12DeFea K.A. Zalevsky J. Thoma M.S. Dery O. Mullins R.D. Bunnett N.W. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 1267-1281Crossref PubMed Scopus (683) Google Scholar, 13Ge L. Ly Y. Hollenberg M. DeFea K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 34418-34426Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Addition of PD98059 reduced base-line MDA MB-231 cell migration by 68 ± 3% (Fig. 1C, cross-hatched bar), suggesting PAR-2 was acting through ERK1/2 to promote migration. Consistent with this effect, base-line ERK1/2 activation was elevated in plasma membrane fractions from MDA MB-231 cells, compared with MDA MB-468 cells, and addition of hAP increased ERK1/2 phosphorylation in both MDA MB-231 and MDA MB-468 cells (Fig. 2). MDA MB-231 Cells Secrete Biologically Active Trypsin—The ability of trypsin inhibitors to block MDA MB-231 cell migration suggests they might secrete trypsin, leading to autocrine activation of PAR-2. We compared the trypsin secreted from MDA MB-231 and MDA MB-468 cells by Western blot of conditioned medium (CM), sampled over 3 h. Trypsin appeared in the medium of MDA MB-231 cells almost immediately and continued to accumulate, while no detectable trypsin appeared in the medium of MDA MB-468 cells (Fig. 3A). The approximate concentration of trypsin of conditioned medium was calculated by comparing the density of antitrypsin immunoreactive bands to a purified trypsin control and was estimated to be in the low nanomolar range (∼1–5 nm). We then tested the ability of CM from MDA MB-231 cells to or MDA MB-468 cells to promote chemotaxis of MDA MB-468 cells. While MDA MB-231 CM resulted in a 12.5 ± 1.4-fold increase in cell migration, MDA MB-468 CM had no effect. Incubation of CM with PIC abolished cell migration demonstrating that the major chemotactic factor present in the medium is a serine protease. Purified trypsin induced a similar (14 ± 2-fold) increase in cell migration (Fig. 3B). PAR-2 Is Constitutively Localized to Pseudopodia in MDA MB-231 Cells—Western blot analysis of total cell extracts suggests that both MDA MB-231 and MDA MB-468 cells express similar amounts of PAR-2 (Fig. 4A), but the patterns of post-translational processing differ slightly. We observe that PAR-2 is heavily glycosylated (indicated by the arrowheads in Fig. 4A), and these bands collapse into the lower band (indicated by an arrow) upon tunicamycin treatment of cells. An intermediate band (indicated by an asterisk) is both glycosylated and phosphorylated as it shifts down upon Alkaline phosphatase treatment of cell lysates. 2M. Mathur and K. DeFea, unpublished observations. The uppermost glycosylated band may contain additional modifications. These different species of PAR-2 are more evident in some cell lines than others, and we are currently investigating the role of differentially processed PAR-2 in its signaling properties. Immunofluorescence reveals that PAR-2 localization in MDA MB-231 cells appears to be enriched at the leading edge, while in the non-migratory MDA MB-468 cells it is distributed more uniformly around the cell surface (Fig. 4B). Furthermore, treatment of MDA MB-231 cells with trypsin inhibitors results in redistribution of PAR-2 around the cell periphery, while treatment of MDA MB-468 cells with hAP results in accumulation of surface PAR-2 at membrane ruffles (Fig. 4C). In MDA MB231 cells, a considerable amount of PAR-2 is localized to intracellular compartments, probably both the Golgi apparatus, as has been reported by several other investigators (22Bohm S.K. Khitin L.M. Grady E.F. Aponte G. Payan D.G. Bunnett N.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22003-22016Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar), and the lysosomes, due to constitutive receptor activation. Of most interest to us from the perspective of cell migration is that fraction localized to the leading edge. To determine whether PAR-2 is constitutively sequestered in extending pseudopodia along with other components of the previously described endosomal scaffold (12DeFea K.A. Zalevsky J. Thoma M.S. Dery O. Mullins R.D. Bunnett N.W. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 1267-1281Crossref PubMed Scopus (683) Google Scholar, 13Ge L. Ly Y. Hollenberg M. DeFea K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 34418-34426Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar), we purified pseudopodia and cell bodies from unstimulated MDA MB-231 cells as described previously (13Ge L. Ly Y. Hollenberg M. DeFea K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 34418-34426Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar, 23Cho S.Y. Klemke R.L. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 156: 725-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Only MDA MB-231 cells were included because pseudopodia formed in response to agonist in MDA MB-468 cells are smaller and result in too little protein for analysis. In untreated MDA MB-231 cells, 95 ± 5% β-arrestin-2, 65 ± 20% β-arrestin-1, 75 ± 5% pERK, and 65 ± 5% pRaf are localized to the pseudopodia (Fig. 5). Total ERK1/2 and Raf-1 are distributed approximately equally between pseudopodia and cell bodies, suggesting the phosphorylated forms are specifically restrained at the leading edge. A study by Brahmbhatt and Klemke (24Brahmbhatt A.A. Klemke R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 13016-13025Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) comparing found that phospho-ERK was specifically associated with extending but not retracting pseudopodia, consistent with the idea that sequestration of signaling molecules to the leading edge might promote persistent migration. Interestingly, the modified forms of PAR-2 are differentially distributed. While ∼80% of the glycosylated PAR-2 is found in the pseudopodia, 97% of the phosphorylated protein and 70% of the unglycosylated protein are restricted to the cell body (Fig. 5). Further studies are required to determine whether glycosylation and phosphorylation play a role in localization of PAR-2 to the pseudopodia and subsequent cell migration. These data are consistent with the hypothesis that trypsin secreted from MDA MB-231 cells activates PAR-2 resulting in its incorporation into a signaling complex at the leading edge of the cell. MDA MB-231 Cell Migration Is Dependent on Both β-Arrestin-1 and -2—Our previous data showed that blocking receptor internalization with a dominant negative fragment of β-arrestin-1 inhibits PAR-2-stimulated ERK1/2 activation and motility (12DeFea K.A. Zalevsky J. Thoma M.S. Dery O. Mullins R.D. Bunnett N.W. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 1267-1281Crossref PubMed Scopus (683) Google Scholar, 13Ge L. Ly Y. Hollenberg M. DeFea K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 34418-34426Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Recent evidence suggests that β-arrestins are not merely redundant family members, and while some receptors appear to depend predominantly on one β-arrestin for both signaling and signal termination functions, others use one for internalization and another for signaling. It is unclear which one β-arrestin PAR-2 “prefers,” and the dominant negative β-arrestin-1 used previously can inhibit both and may even have a more global effect on membrane trafficking. We used siRNA to knockdown β-arrestin-1 and -2 expression either individually or together and found that inhibiting expression of either of the β-arrestin-1 or -2 reduced base-line MDA MB-231 cell migration (by 55 ± 10% and 50 ± 12%, respectively), while simultaneous knockdown of both β-arrestins resulted in a 71 ± 4% reduction (Fig. 6B). To investigate whether the effects of PAR-2 and β-arrestins on cell migration was through the same pathway, we examined the effect of siRNA knockdown on PAR-2-stimulated cell motility, in the presence of PIC. As described in the legend to Fig. 1C, addition of PIC depresses base-line cell migration, and addition of hAP or 2f-AP restores migration. In the presence of PIC, siRNA knockdown of β-arrestin-1 expression abolishes 2f-AP-stimulated cell migration, and knockdown of β-arrestin-2 reduces 2f-AP-stimulated migration by 92 ± 6%, suggesting that PAR-2-stimulated migration requires both β-arrestin-1 and -2 (Fig. 6C) and introducing the question of whether they each have distinct roles in PAR-2 signaling. To determine whether a point of divergence in the role of β-arrestins in cell migration was ERK1/2 activation, we examined the effect β-arrestin-1 and -2 siRNA on ERK1/2 activation after pretreatment of cells with PIC to suppress base-line PAR-2 activity. Knockdown of either β-arrestin-1 or -2 expression PAR-2 stimulated ERK1/2 phosphorylation by 80–90% (Fig. 6D), suggesting both β-arrestins contribute to PAR-2-stimulated ERK1/2 activation and that the distinct roles for β-arrestin-1 and -2 in cell migration might lie downstream of ERK1/2. In the studies described here, we provide evidence supporting the hypothesis that secreted proteases enhance the metastatic potential of tumor cells by inducing migration (2Ducroc R. Bontemps C. Marazova K. Devaud H. Darmoul D. Laburthe M. Life Sci. 2002; 70: 1359-1367Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 4Li Y. Sarkar F.H.

Chem. 2000; 275: 26333-26342Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar) and introduce a mechanism for these events. We show that a highly metastatic breast cancer cell line, MDA MB-231, secretes trypsin and exhibits constitutive migration, while a less metastatic tumor cell line, MDA MB-468, does not. Base-line migration of MDA MB-231 cells is inhibited by the addition of serine protease inhibitors or a scrambled PAR-2 peptide. Subsequent activation of PAR-2 by specific activating peptides restores cell migration in the presence of protease inhibitors to basal levels or higher. These data suggest that the contribution of serine proteases to MDA MB-231 cell migration is mediated by PAR-2. While other serine proteases capable of activating PAR-2 may be present as well, trypsin is a known agonist of the receptor, and its increased secretion in MDA MB-231 cells suggests it may play an important role in constitutive PAR-2 activation and cell migration in these cells. Further strengthening this hypothesis, we observe that medium from MDA MB-231 cells can promote migration of the less metastatic MDA MB-468, and this effect is ameliorated by with serine protease inhibitors. While autocrine activation of PAR-2 is likely to account for only part of the constitutive migration of these and other tumor cells, the data here support a model where trypsin-like proteases contribute to the metastatic potential of a cell by activating migratory pathways through cell-surface receptors and provide a physiologically significant role for β-arrestin scaffolding of signaling molecules. A specific requirement for β-arrestin-2 in lymphocyte motility has recently been demonstrated using β-arrestin-1 and -2 knock-out mice (18Fong A.M. Premont R.T. Richardson R.M. Yu Y.R. Lefkowitz R.J. Patel D.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 7478-7483Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). An interesting outcome of the studies described here is the evidence that both β-arrestins are required for PAR-2-mediated motility, suggesting they are not redundant, even for receptors that appear to utilize both. Such a finding is consistent with studies by others demonstrating that the two β-arrestin proteins differ in their specific cellular functions (17Ahn S. Nelson C.D. Garrison T.R. Miller W.E.

Ge and K. DeFea, manuscript in preparation. Previous studies in our laboratory demonstrated that migration is dependent upon β-arrestins and ERK1/2 and appears to involve trafficking of the activated kinases to the pseudopodia on early endosomal vesicles (12DeFea K.A. Zalevsky J. Thoma M.S. Dery O. Mullins R.D. Bunnett N.W. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 1267-1281Crossref PubMed Scopus (683) Google Scholar, 13Ge L. Ly Y. Hollenberg M. DeFea K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 34418-34426Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Here we show that the components of this endosomal scaffold are constitutively localized to pseudopodia in MDA MB-231 cells. Interestingly, although both β-arrestin-1 and -2 are required for cell migration, β-arrestin-2 is enriched to a greater extent in the pseudopodia, consistent with the hypothesis that the two β-arrestins may have separate functions in cell motility. Studies comparing a variety of breast cancer cell lines have demonstrated that MDA MB-468 cells exhibit low levels of endothelial cell invasion, compared with MDA MB-231 cells, and are not metastatic in a nude mouse model (19Zhang R.D. Fidler I.J. Price J.E. Invasion Metastasis. 1991; 11: 204-215PubMed Google Scholar, 20Gordon L.A. Mulligan K.T. Maxwell-Jones H. Adams M. Walker R.A. Jones J.L. Int. J.

Cancer. 2002; 101: 317-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The fact that less metastatic tumor cells both express PAR-2 and migrate in response to its activation is interesting because a number of proteases released during inflammation can activate PAR-2 (8Camerer E. Huang W. Coughlin S.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 5255-5260Crossref PubMed Scopus (604) Google Scholar, 29Dery O. Bunnett N.W. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1999; 27: 246-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), raising the possibility that chronic inflammation in a cancerous tissue might increase the metastatic potential of a tumor. Most chemotherapeutic agents target cell division; because metastasis involves proliferation of tumor cells after they have invaded the blood vessel wall, the tumor cells are thought to prevent metastasis as well. However, tumor cells may possess multiple mechanisms for cell migration, which they can utilize independent of cell division. Further studies are required to determine whether trypsin secretion and PAR-2 endosomal scaffold formation are altered in a broad spectrum of tumor cells, whether PAR-2 is required for metastasis of certain tumors in vivo, the efficacy of serine protease inhibitors and PAR-2 antagonists in preventing metastasis, and the role of β-arrestins in this process. The use of serine protease inhibitors as therapeutics is not a new concept, and trypsin and tryptase inhibitors have been used in the treatment of diseases such as asthma, emphysema, and α1-antitrypsin deficiency (25Eden E. Hammel J. Rouhani F.N. Brantly M.L. Barker A.F. Buist A.S. Fallat R.J. Stoller J.K. Crystal R.G. Turino G.M.

Over the last few years, however, the utility of targeting serine proteases as a means of preventing tumor metastasis has been an active area of research. While the major focus has been on the role of proteases in degrading the tumor stroma and basement membrane, the studies described here suggest that activation of cell migration pathways through cell surface receptors may also contribute to the prometastatic action of serine proteases.

We recently isolated a novel roundabout gene, called Robo4, which is restricted in expression to the endothelium, notably in areas of angiogenesis. The aim of this study was to use the soluble extracellular domain of Robo4 as a probe of function in angiogenesis and endothelial biology. Thus, the soluble extracellular domain of the receptor (Robo4Fc) showed diverse in vivo and in vitro activities including 1) inhibition of angiogenesis in vivo in the rodent subcutaneous sponge model, 2) inhibition of tube formation in the rat aortic ring assay, 3) inhibition of VEGF- and bFGF-stimulated endothelial cell migration, and 4) inhibition of endothelial proliferation. To assess whether Robo4Fc was inhibiting Slit-mediated effects, we determined whether Robo4 and Slit interact. Recombinant Slits-1, -2, and -3 were shown by immunoprecipitation and BiaCore analysis to bind to Robo1 but not Robo4. Further study of the role of Robo4 in angiogenesis appears justified."
https://openalex.org/W2107750976,"The vertebrate transient receptor potential cationic channel TRPV4 has been proposed as an osmo- and mechanosensor channel. Studies using knock-out animal models have further emphasized the relevance of the TRPV4 channel in the maintenance of the internal osmotic equilibrium and mechanosensation. However, at the cellular level, there is still one important question to answer: does the TRPV4 channel generate the Ca2+ signal in those cells undergoing a Ca2+-dependent regulatory volume decrease (RVD) response? RVD in human airway epithelia requires the generation of a Ca2+ signal to activate Ca2+-dependent K+ channels. The RVD response is lost in airway epithelia affected with cystic fibrosis (CF), a disease caused by mutations in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator channel. We have previously shown that the defective RVD in CF epithelia is linked to the lack of swelling-dependent activation of Ca2+-dependent K+ channels. In the present study, we show the expression of TRPV4 in normal human airway epithelia, where it functions as the Ca2+ entry pathway that triggers the RVD response after hypotonic stress, as demonstrated by TRPV4 antisense experiments. However, cell swelling failed to trigger Ca2+ entry via TRPV4 channels in CF airway epithelia, although the channel's response to a specific synthetic activator, 4α-phorbol 12,13-didecanoate, was maintained. Furthermore, RVD was recovered in CF airway epithelia treated with 4α-phorbol 12,13-didecanoate. Together, these results suggest that defective RVD in CF airway epithelia might be caused by the absence of a TRPV4-mediated Ca2+ signal and the subsequent activation of Ca2+-dependent K+ channels.

Although many studies have implied the involvement of TRPV4 channel in osmosensation (7Liedtke W. Tobin D.M. Bargmann C.I. Friedman J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 14531-14536Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar, 12Mizuno A. Matsumoto N. Imai M. Suzuki M. Am. J. Physiol. 2003; 285: C96-C101Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar), the role of this channel in the regulatory volume decrease (RVD) response triggered in many cells under hypotonic conditions has not been evaluated. Exposure of cells to hypotonic solutions results in cell swelling followed, in most cases, by an RVD response that returns the cells to their original size. This process involves the activation of ionic pathways that permit the passive loss of electrolytes (typically via K+ and Cl– channels) and osmotically obliged water (13Hoffmann E.K. Dunham P.B. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1995; 161: 173-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar). In several cell types, entry of extracellular Ca2+ and subsequent activation of Ca2+-dependent K+ channels is required for an effective RVD (14McCarty N.A. O'Neil R.G. Physiol. Rev. 1992; 72: 1037-1061Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar, 15Pasantes-Morales H. Morales-Mulia S. Nephron. 2000; 86: 414-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). The recent molecular and functional characterization of the TRPV4 channel has suggested its participation in the generation of this Ca2+ signal and the triggering of RVD, although this hypothesis needs to be tested. Human airway epithelia show a typical Ca2+-dependent RVD under hypotonic conditions (16Fernandez-Fernandez J.M. Nobles M. Currid A. Vazquez E. Valverde M.A. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 283: C1705-C1714Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), but this RVD response is lost in cystic fibrosis (CF) airways (17Vazquez E. Nobles M. Valverde M.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 5329-5334Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The cellular defect associated with the impaired RVD in CF epithelia is mainly linked to the dysfunction of volume-sensitive K+ channels (17Vazquez E. Nobles M. Valverde M.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 5329-5334Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 18Valverde M.A. O'Brien J.A. Sepulveda F.V. Ratcliff R.A. Evans M.J. College W.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Am. J. Physiol. 2003; 284: F796-F811Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). It has been proposed that the dysfunction of K+ channels required for the RVD response might be related to the lack of a Ca2+ signal in CF epithelia, at least in airway and small intestine epithelia (17Vazquez E. Nobles M. Valverde M.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 5329-5334Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 18Valverde M.A. O'Brien J.A. Sepulveda F.V. Ratcliff R.A. Evans M.J.

In this study, we have evaluated the contribution of the TRPV4 channel to the RVD response in normal and CF airway epithelia; in doing so, we have achieved two specific goals. First, we have demonstrated that the TRPV4 channel is the only pathway mediating the swelling-activated Ca2+ entry required to achieve a full RVD in human tracheal epithelial cells. Second, we have shown that the impaired RVD response in CF airway epithelia is caused by a misregulation of TRPV4, suggesting that hypotonic activation of TRPV4 channels is CFTR-dependent. Cells—The cystic fibrosis tracheal epithelial cell line CFT1 was obtained from a CF ΔPhe508/ΔPhe508 patient, and the reverted non-CF cell line CFT1-LCFSN was generated by stable transfection of CFT1 cells with wild-type CFTR (22Yankaskas J.R.

Both cell lines were grown in Ham's F12 medium (Invitrogen) as described previously (17Vazquez E. Nobles M. Valverde M.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 5329-5334Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The cystic fibrosis bronchial epithelial cell line CFBE was also obtained from a CF ΔPhe508/ΔPhe508 patient. CFBE cells were grown in modified Eagle's medium with Earle's salts (Invitrogen), 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen), and 1% gentamycin (Sigma). The three cell lines were cultured in fibronectin-coated flasks (16Fernandez-Fernandez J.M. Nobles M. Currid A. Vazquez E. Valverde M.A. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 283: C1705-C1714Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Cells were seeded onto plastic dishes or glass coverslips and used for experiments within 2–3 days. Cytosolic Ca2+ Measurements—Cells were incubated in isotonic bath solution containing 2 μm fura-2 AM (Molecular Probes, Leiden, The Netherlands) for 30 min at room temperature. The cells were then washed thoroughly before initiating the experiment. Video microscopic measurements of [Ca2+]i were obtained using an Olympus IX70 inverted microscope (Hamburg, Germany) with a 40× oil-immersion objective (Olympus). A Polychrome IV monochromator (Till Photonics, Martinsried, Germany) supplied the excitation light (340 and 380 nm), which was directed toward the cells in the field of view by a 505DR dichromatic mirror (Omega Optical, Brattleboro, VT). Fluorescence images were collected by a digital charge-coupled device camera (Hamamatsu Photonics, Hamamatsu City, Japan), after their passage through a 535DF emission filter (Omega Optical), using the AquaCosmos software program (Hamamatsu Photonics). 340/380 nm ratio images were computed every 5 s. The isotonic bathing solution contained 2.5 mm KCl, 140 mm NaCl, 1.2 mm CaCl2, 0.5 mm MgCl2, 5 mm glucose, and 10 mm HEPES (310 milliosmolal, pH 7.35). The hypotonic bathing solution (220 mosm, pH 7.35) was prepared by omitting 50 mm NaCl from the isotonic solution and adjusting the osmolality with d-mannitol where necessary. Ca2+-free extracellular solutions were obtained by replacing CaCl2 with MgCl2. All chemicals were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich except iberiotoxin (Alomone Laboratories, Jerusalem, Israel). Volume Measurements: Morphometric Analysis—Cell volume experiments were carried out at room temperature. Cells were seeded on glass coverslips and were placed in a recording chamber after 3–4 h. The cells were subsequently washed with isotonic solution. Well defined single round cells were selected and digital images acquired using Aquacosmos software (Hamamatsu). The individual cell volume was calculated as described previously (23Bond T.D. Ambikapathy S. Mohammad S. Valverde M.A. J. Physiol. 1998; 511: 45-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 24Lock H. Valverde M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 34849-34852Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) and presented as the ratio of volume at time t divided by that measured at time t = 0. Electrophysiological Recordings—Ionic currents were measured at room temperature using the whole-cell recording mode of the patch-clamp technique (25Hamill O.P. Marty A. Neher E. Sakmann B. Sigworth J. Pfluegers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 1981; 391: 85-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (15187) Google Scholar) through a D-6100 amplifier (List Medical, Darm-stadt, Germany). The pClamp8 software (Axon Instruments, Foster City, CA) was used for pulse generation, data acquisition, and subsequent analysis. Whole-cell cationic currents were recorded using boro-silicate glass electrodes (2–4 MΩ) filled with a solution containing 120 mm N-methyl-d-glucamine chloride, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 30 mm HEPES, 4 mm ATP, and 0.1 mm GTP (290 milliosmolal, pH 7.25). Bath solution contained 125 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, and 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.36, 305 milliosmolal (adjusted with d-mannitol)). Cells were held at 0 mV and ramps from –140 mV to +100 mV with a duration of 200 ms were applied at a frequency of 0.2 Hz. Ramp data were acquired at 10 KHz and low-pass filtered at 1 kHz. Whole-cell K+ (Maxi K+ and hIK) currents were measured as described previously (16Fernandez-Fernandez J.M. Nobles M. Currid A. Vazquez E. Valverde M.A. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 283: C1705-C1714Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 17Vazquez E. Nobles M. Valverde M.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 5329-5334Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Pipette solution contained 140 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 0.15 mm CaCl2, 0.5 mm EGTA, and 10 mm HEPES (290 milliosmolal, pH 7.25; the intracellular free Ca2+ concentration was 50 nm as calculated using EqCal from Biosoft (Cambridge, UK)). The isotonic bathing solution contained 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1.2 mm CaCl2, 0.5 mm MgCl2, 5 mm glucose, 10 mm HEPES, and 90 mm d-mannitol (305 milliosmolal; pH 7.35). The hypotonic bathing solution (215 milliosmolal) was prepared by omitting d-mannitol from the isotonic solution. Ca2+-free bath solutions, containing 0 Ca2+, 1.5 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm EGTA, were also used in several experiments. Cells were clamped at –80 mV and pulsed for 400 ms from –100 mV to +100 mV in 20-mV steps. RNA Extraction and RT-PCR—RNA extraction and RT-PCR were performed as described previously (16Fernandez-Fernandez J.M. Nobles M. Currid A. Vazquez E. Valverde M.A. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 283: C1705-C1714Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). In brief, RNA was isolated from CFT1-LCFSN, CFT1, and CFBE cells using the Nucleospin RNA II kit (Macherey-Nagel, Germany), according to the manufacturer's instructions. Total RNA (1–2 μg) was reverse-transcribed to cDNA. GADPH was used as a positive control, and negative controls (absence of the oligodT primer or MMLV-RT) were also performed. We used the following primer pair for PCR amplification of TRPV4: forward, 5′-CCTCTTCCCCGACAGCAAC-3′, and reverse, 5′-CCCCAGTGAAGAGCGTAATG-3′, as described previously (16Fernandez-Fernandez J.M. Nobles M. Currid A. Vazquez E. Valverde M.A. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 283: C1705-C1714Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), which gives a 500 bp product (nucleotides 1154–1653; GenBank™ accession number NM_021625, isoform a) and a 319 product in case of isoform b (nucleotides 1154–1473; GenBank™ accession number NM_147204). The amplicons were confirmed by direct sequencing. Cloning of Human TRPV4 (hTRPV4) and Transient Expression in HEK-293 Cells—Total RNA was extracted from human tracheal epithelial CFT1-LCFSN cells using the Nucleospin RNA II Kit (Macherey-Nagel, Düven, Germany). The full-length TRPV4 cDNA was amplified by an RT-PCR-based protocol (OneStep RT-PCR kit; Qiagen) using the following profile: 1 h at 50 °C, 15 min at 90 °C, 45 cycles of 1 min at 94 °C, 1 min at 55 °C and 3.5 min plus 1 s/cycle at 68 °C ending with 10 min at 68 °C. The primers used were: forward, 5′-AAGCATGGCGGATTCCAGCGAAG-3′ (nucleotides 86–108); and reverse, 5′-CTAGAGCGGGGCGTCATCAGTC-3′ (nucleotides 2684–2705). The fully sequenced TRPV4 cDNA corresponded to the GenBank™ accession number NM_021625 (isoform a) containing a synonymous single nucleotide polymorphism in position 761 (dbSNP reference number rs3825394). The cDNA was inserted into the eukaryotic pcDNA-3 expression vector and transfected into HEK-293 cells, grown as described previously (26Vriens J. Watanabe H. Janssens A. Droogmans G. Voets T. Nilius B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 396-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar), using a linear polyethylenimine derivative (polycation ExGen500; Fermentas MBI). Cells were seeded in 35-mm dishes at 80% confluence and transfected with 3 μg of the construct, together with the reporter pEGFPN1 at a 10:1 ratio or with pEGFPN1 alone (control). Antisense Oligonucleotides—CFT1-LCFSN cells were seeded in 12-mm wells at 80% confluence and were exposed to 1 μm of TRPV4 antisense morpholino oligonucleotide with a sequence 5′-GCCTTCGCTGGAATCCGCCAT-3′ which hybridizes to the first 21 nucleotides (90–110 bp) of both isoform a (GenBank NM_021625) and isoform b (GenBank NM_147204) of the human TRPV4 or to 1 μm β-globin antisense morpholino oligonucleotide with the sequence 5′-CCTCTTACCTCAgTTACAATTTATA-3′ as negative control (Gene Tools, Corvallis, OR) plus 100 ng of pEGFP plasmid (BD Biosciences Clontech) diluted into 25 μl of serum-free medium. Cells were transfected by a Lipofectamine Plus (Invitrogen) procedure following the manufacturer's instructions. 24 h after transfection, cells were trypsinized and seeded for performing experiments within 1–2 days. Western Blot—88 μg of total protein was obtained from CFT1-LCFSN cells harvested 96 h after transfection with TRPV4/β-globin antisense (6 μm). The protein was separated on a polyacrylamide gel (8%) and electrotransferred to nitrocellulose membrane (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA). Total protein from HEK-293 cells transfected with TRPV4 was used as a control. The nitrocellulose membrane was incubated in blocking buffer (5% nonfat dry milk in TTBS (100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, and 0.1% Tween 20)) for 1 h at room temperature, followed by incubation overnight at 4 °C in blocking buffer containing TRPV4 antibody (1:500 dilution). This antibody was raised against a synthetic peptide representing the C-terminal sequence of human TRPV4 (CDGHQQGYPRKWRTDDAPL) and then subjected to affinity purification with the peptide antigen. The membranes were washed with blocking buffer to remove the nonspecific binding and incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated donkey antirabbit IgG (Amersham Biosciences) at a dilution of 1:2000 in blocking buffer for 1 h at room temperature. Nitrocellulose membranes were incubated with an enhanced chemiluminescence reagent (SuperSignal West Femto, Chemiluminescent Substrate; Pierce) and films (Amersham Biosciences) were exposed to the membrane. Statistics—Results are expressed as means ± S.E of n observations. Student's t test was performed to examine statistical significance. p ± 0.05 was considered significant. Swelling-activated Ca2+ Entry in Normal and CF Human Tracheal Epithelial Cells—CFT1 tracheal epithelial cells, derived from a ΔPhe508/ΔPhe508 patient, show a typical CF ion transport phenotype, including impaired RVD, whereas the CFT1-LCFSN cells, obtained by stable transfection of CFT1 cells with wild-type CFTR, show both cAMP-dependent ion secretion and RVD (17Vazquez E. Nobles M. Valverde M.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 5329-5334Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The RVD response in the recovered tracheal cells (CFT1-LCFSN), as well as in normal human bronchial cells, relies on the activation of Ca2+-dependent K+ channels after the influx of Ca2+ (16Fernandez-Fernandez J.M. Nobles M. Currid A. Vazquez E. Valverde M.A. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 283: C1705-C1714Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 17Vazquez E. Nobles M. Valverde M.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 5329-5334Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Therefore, we evaluated whether CF airway epithelial cells might posses a defect in the activation of swelling-dependent Ca2+ entry. Using the Ca2+-sensitive fura-2 dye, we observed that CFT1-LCFSN cells triggered a significant Ca2+ signal in response to a 30% hypotonic shock (Fig. 1A), whereas CFT1 cells showed negligibly low changes (Fig. 1B). Removal of extracellular Ca2+ or addition of Gd3+ abolished the Ca2+ response of CFT1-LCFSN cells to hypotonic stress (results not shown). The molecular nature of the Ca2+ entry pathway was subsequently investigated. Functional Expression of TRPV4 Channel in Airway Tracheal Epithelial Cells—A possible candidate to mediate Ca2+ entry in response to cell swelling is the TRPV4 channel (4Nilius B. Vriens J. Prenen J. Droogmans G. Voets T. Am. J. Physiol. 2004; 286: C195-C205Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar). Therefore, we evaluated the expression and function of TRPV4 channels and their contribution to RVD in normal and CF airway epithelial cells. Expression of TRPV4 channel in human normal (CFT1-LCFSN cells) and CF tracheal epithelial cells (CFT1) was analyzed by RT-PCR. Fig. 1C shows the amplification of two specific bands corresponding to TRPV4 isoforms a (500 bp) and b (319 bp) in CFT1-LCSFN and CFT1 cells. The activity of the TRPV4 channel was evaluated using a synthetic activator, 4α-phorbol 12,13-didecanoate (4α-PDD), specific for the TRPV4 channel (11Watanabe H. Davis J.B. Smart D. Jerman J.C.

The intracellular Ca2+ signals induced by 1 μm 4α-PDD in the non cystic fibrosis tracheal cell line CFT1-LCSFN (Fig. 2A; mean peak 340/380 ratio increase: 0.16 ± 0.02; n = 13) and the cystic fibrosis CFT1 cell line (Fig. 2B; mean increase 0.10 ± 0.06; n = 30) were not statistically significant. The response to 4α-PDD in both cell lines was abolished in the absence of extracellular Ca2+ (Fig. 2, C–D) or in the presence of 100 μm Gd3+ (Fig. 2, E–F), a blocker of TRPV4 channels (1Strotmann R. Harteneck C. Nunnenmacher K. Schultz G. Plant T.D. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 695-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (809) Google Scholar). The activity of TRPV4 was also evaluated electrophysiologically. Application of 1 μm 4α-PDD induced typical TRPV4 cationic currents that rectified inwardly when pipettes were loaded with impermeant cation-containing solutions (Fig. 2, G–H). Taken together, our data support the presence of TRPV4 in both human normal and CF tracheal epithelial cells, although its activation by cell swelling appears only in non-CF cells. Defective activation of TRPV4 in CF cells under hypotonic conditions might explain the impaired Ca2+-dependent RVD observed in different CF epithelia (17Vazquez E. Nobles M. Valverde M.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 5329-5334Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 19Valverde M.A. Vazquez E. Munoz F.J. Nobles M. Delaney S.J. Wainwright B.J. Colledge W.H. Sheppard D.N. Cell Physiol. Biochem. 2000; 10: 321-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). This hypothesis relies on the assumption that TRPV4 channels are essential in providing the Ca2+ entry pathway to trigger the RVD response in airway epithelia. Therefore, we next investigated the role of TRPV4 in the RVD response in CFT1-LCFSN. TRPV4 Channel Activity Is Required for RVD in Tracheal Epithelial Cells—Many reports have demonstrated the activation of TRPV4 channels after cell swelling under hypotonic conditions (for review, see Ref. 4Nilius B. Vriens J. Prenen J. Droogmans G. Voets T. Am. J. Physiol. 2004; 286: C195-C205Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar). However, none have shown that the activation of TRPV4 channels provides the actual Ca2+ signal needed to trigger the RVD response. To test this hypothesis, we incubated CFT1-LCSFN cells with TRPV4 antisense oligonucleotides. We also used a control antisense oligonucleotide directed against an unrelated protein, β-globin. As illustrated in Fig. 3E, TRPV4 antisense specifically reduced TRPV4 protein expression levels compared with control β-globin antisense (α-tubulin expression was unaltered; results not shown). Next, the hypotonic-induced activity of Ca2+-dependent KCNN4 potassium channels, needed for the RVD response (17Vazquez E. Nobles M. Valverde M.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 5329-5334Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), and the RVD itself were evaluated. Swelling-dependent activation of KCNN4 currents, which occurs only in the presence of extracellular Ca2+ (results not shown), was prevented in TRPV4 antisense-treated cells (Fig. 3A) but preserved in CFT1-LCFSN cells treated with control antisense (Fig. 3B). Morphometric cell volume analysis showed that anti-TRPV4 oligonucleotides inhibited the RVD response (Fig. 3C) in CFT1-LCFSN cells. Cells incubated with control oligonucleotides maintained the RVD response, recovering to nearly 100% of their original volume after 25 min (Fig. 3D). The fact that both activation of Ca2+-dependent K+ channels and RVD are prevented in those cells incubated with TRPV4 antisense oligonucleotide provides the first direct piece of evidence relating the activity of TRPV4 with the RVD response. Human CF Bronchial Epithelial Cells Also Show Defective Ca2+-dependent RVD—Human bronchial epithelial cells also show an RVD that depends on the entry of Ca2+ and the activation of Maxi K+ channels (KCNMA1) (16Fernandez-Fernandez J.M. Nobles M. Currid A. Vazquez E. Valverde M.A. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 283: C1705-C1714Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). However, no data exist on the RVD response in human CF bronchial epithelial cells. The presence of the two TRPV4 isoforms (a and b) in a human CF bronchial epithelial cell line (CFBE) obtained from a patient homozygous for the ΔPhe508 mutation was determined by RT-PCR (Fig. 4A). CFBE cells exposed to 30% hypotonicity, like human CF tracheal cells (CFT1) (17Vazquez E. Nobles M. Valverde M.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 5329-5334Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), were unable to regulate their volume and remained swollen during the 20-min exposure to hypotonic solution (Fig. 4B). Similar to CF tracheal cells (CFT1), CFBE cells did not respond with a significant increase in intracellular Ca2+ when exposed to hypotonic solutions (Fig. 4C) but did respond to 1 μm 4α-PDD (Fig. 4D). The response to 4α-PDD was absent when cells were incubated in Ca2+-free solutions or in the presence of 100 μm Gd3+ (results not shown). As mentioned above, RVD in normal human bronchial epithelial cells requires the activation of Maxi K+ channels (16Fernandez-Fernandez J.M. Nobles M. Currid A. Vazquez E. Valverde M.A. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 283: C1705-C1714Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Maxi K+ currents in CFBE, identified by their inhibition by 100 nm iberiotoxin (results not shown), failed to respond to hypotonic conditions (Fig. 4E). Current density at –100 mV was 37.7 ± 4.19 pA/pF (n = 13) under isotonic conditions and 39.3 ± 4.9 pA/pF (n = 8) under hypotonic conditions. Together, these results suggest that human CF tracheal and bronchial cells lack an effective RVD because of a deficient Ca2+ influx via the TRPV4 channel and the subsequent activation of Ca2+-dependent K+ channels. Activation of TRPV4 by 4α-PDD Restores RVD in CF Airway Cells—The possibility to revert the defective RVD in human CF airway cells using the TRPV4 activator 4α-PDD was evaluated next. CFT1 and CFBE cells underwent a significant RVD when exposed to hypotonic conditions in the presence of 1 μm 4α-PDD (Fig. 5, A and D). Whereas CF tracheal cells required the presence of 4α-PDD throughout the whole hypotonic stimulus for an effective RVD, CF bronchial cells rapidly down-regulate their volume immediately after the addition of 4α-PDD.

 uses a modified DICE-99 modeling structure to explore the relative efficacy of implementing near-term mitigation policies as a hedge against model, calibration, and implementation uncertainties about temperature targets and climate sensitivity. Implementing modest mitigation over the near term minimizes the expected cost of selecting equally likely temperature targets in 2035 across a recently calibrated probability distribution for climate sensitivity that extends up to 9ÂoC. Hedging effectively buys insurance against future adjustment costs and is extremely robust across most possible futures, especially when compared with a wait-and-see strategy that would eschew mitigation over the first third of this century."
https://openalex.org/W2114145205,"Recent data have revealed that soluble oligomeric forms of amyloid peptide (Abeta) may be the proximate effectors of the neuronal injury and death occurring in Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, the molecular mechanisms associated with the neuronal cell death induced by the nonfibrillar Abeta remain to be elucidated. In this study, we investigated the role of the cytosolic Ca2+-dependent phospholipase A2 (cPLA2), and its associated metabolic pathway, i.e., the arachidonic acid (AA) cascade, in the apoptotic cell death induced by soluble oligomers of Abeta. The treatment of rat cortical neurons with low concentrations of soluble Abeta(1-40) or Abeta(1-42) peptide resulted in an early calcium-dependent release of AA associated with a transient relocalization of cPLA2. Both cPLA2 antisense oligonucleotides and a selective inhibitor of cPLA2 activity abolished the release of AA from neurons and also protected cells against apoptosis induced by Abeta. Furthermore, inhibitors of the PKC, p38, and MEK/ERK pathways that are involved in cPLA2 phosphorylation and activation reduced Abeta-induced cell death. Finally, we demonstrate that inhibitors of cyclooxygenase-2 reduced the Abeta-induced cell death by 55%. Our studies suggest a novel neuronal response of soluble oligomers of Abeta, which occurs through a cPLA2 signaling cascade and an AA-dependent death pathway. This may prove to be crucial in AD processes and could provide important targets for drug development."

https://openalex.org/W2046140230,"In contrast with earlier assumptions, which classified human tear lipocalin (Tlc) as an outlier member of the lipocalin protein family, the 1.8-Å resolution crystal structure of the recombinant apoprotein confirms the typical eight-stranded antiparallel β-barrel architecture with an α-helix attached to it. The fold of Tlc most closely resembles the bovine dander allergen Bos d 2, a well characterized prototypic lipocalin, but also reveals similarity with β-lactoglobulin. However, compared with other lipocalin structures Tlc exhibits an extremely wide ligand pocket, whose entrance is formed by four partially disordered loops. The cavity deeply extends into the β-barrel structure, where it ends in two distinct lobes. This unusual structural feature explains the known promiscuity of Tlc for various ligands, with chemical structures ranging from lipids and retinoids to the macrocyclic antibiotic rifampin and even to microbial siderophores. Notably, earlier findings of biological activity as a thiol protease inhibitor have no correspondence in the three-dimensional structure of Tlc, rather it appears that its proteolytic fragments could be responsible for this phenomenon.

Later on it was also found to be produced by a number of other secretory glands and tissues, including lingual glands, nasal mucosal glands, secretory glands of the tracheobronchial tract, sweat glands, mammary gland, adrenal gland, prostate, thymus, testis, and by corticotrophs of the pituitary gland (3Scalfari F.

Berger P. Redl B. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 2002; 50: 433-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). cDNA cloning and sequencing revealed that this protein component is a member of the lipocalin superfamily with significant amino acid similarity to β-lactoglobulin (7Redl B. Holzfeind P. Lottspeich F. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 20282-20287Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), one of the classical lipocalins. Because it lacks one of the three conserved amino acid motifs that are normally present in lipocalins, Tlc was initially classified as an outlier member of this protein family (8Flower D.R. Biochem. J. 1996; 318: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (1374) Google Scholar). However, a typical β-barrel fold was predicted from a hydropathy profile of the amino acid sequence (7Redl B. Holzfeind P. Lottspeich F. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 20282-20287Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), circular dichroism analysis (9Glasgow B.J. Abduragimov A.R. Yusifov T.N. Gasymov O.K. Horwitz J. Hubbell W.L. Faull K.F. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 2215-2225Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), and also from an extended site-directed tryptophan substitution and fluorescence study (10Gasymov O.K. Abduragimov A.R. Yusifov T.N. Glasgow B.J. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 14754-14762Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), revealing β-sheet and α-helical composition similar to other lipocalins. Nevertheless, Tlc possesses several biochemical activities that must be conferred by unique structural properties. As an ordinary feature of a lipocalin protein, it binds hydrophobic compounds; yet it exhibits an unusually broad ligand specificity, as compared with other members of this family. A large number of lipophilic substances belonging to different chemical classes, including fatty acids, fatty alcohols, phospholipids, glycolipids, cholesterol, retinol, arachidonic acid, as well as lipid peroxidation products, such as isoprostanes, were found as endogenous ligands of the protein isolated from tear fluid or from human NT2 precursor cells (5Redl B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1482: 241-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 11Glasgow B.J. Abduragimov A.R. Farahbakhsh Z.T. Faull K.F. Hubbell W.L. Curr. Eye Res. 1995; 14: 363-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar, 12Lechner M. Wojnar P. Redl B. Biochem. J. 2001; 356: 129-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Contrasting with other lipocalins, the ligand affinity correlates with the length of the hydrocarbon chain both for alkyl amides and fatty acids. Thus, Tlc binds most strongly the least soluble lipids (13Gasymov O.K. Abduragimov A.R. Yusifov T.N. Glasgow B.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1433: 307-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). By transporting or scavenging lipoid compounds, Tlc may function in the integrity of the tear film with its peculiar aqueous-lipid interface and, more generally, in the protection or repair of epithelial surfaces (5Redl B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1482: 241-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Recently, Tlc was also shown to bind bacterial and fungal iron siderophore complexes, thus suggesting antimicrobial function (14Fluckinger M. Haas H. Merschak P. Glasgow B.J. Redl B. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2004; 48: 3367-3372Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Furthermore, binding activity for the antibiotic drug rifampin was reported (15Gasymov O.K. Abduragimov A.R. Gasimov E.O. Yusifov T.N. Dooley A.N. Glasgow B.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1688: 102-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Finally, Tlc accepts several synthetic ligands, such as 11-(((5-(dimethylamino)-1-naphthalenyl)sulfonyl)amino)undecanoic acid (13Gasymov O.K. Abduragimov A.R. Yusifov T.N. Glasgow B.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1433: 307-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) or the spin label compound 16-doxylstearic acid (10Gasymov O.K. Abduragimov A.R. Yusifov T.N. Glasgow B.J. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 14754-14762Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The structural influence of the three Cys residues in Tlc has been investigated (9Glasgow B.J. Abduragimov A.R. Yusifov T.N. Gasymov O.K. Horwitz J. Hubbell W.L. Faull K.F. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 2215-2225Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Mass determination of tryptic fragments revealed that a single intramolecular disulfide bond joins Cys-61 with Cys-153 and that Cys-101 resides as a free cysteine (numbers corresponding to the mature polypeptide sequence after processing of the 18-residue signal peptide). The disulfide bridge is conserved in most lipocalins and connects the β-barrel, usually strand D, with the C-terminal peptide segment (16Skerra A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1482: 337-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). Reduction of this disulfide bridge in Tlc did not significantly affect protein secondary structure but had an influence on the ligand binding behavior (9Glasgow B.J. Abduragimov A.R. Yusifov T.N. Gasymov O.K. Horwitz J. Hubbell W.L. Faull K.F. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 2215-2225Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Apart from its ligand binding properties, Tlc was shown in vitro to inhibit cysteine proteinases (17van't Hof W. Blankenvoorde M.F. Veerman E.C. Amerongen A.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1837-1841Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar) and to act as a nonspecific endonuclease (18Yusifov T.N. Abduragimov A.R. Gasymov O.K. Glasgow B.J. Biochem. J. 2000; 347: 815-819Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), both activities that are unusual among lipocalins. So far, no high resolution structural information was available for this lipocalin. In order to understand the molecular basis of its possibly multiple physiological functions, we expressed Tlc in Escherichia coli and crystallized the recombinant protein. Here we report the 1.8-Å crystal structure of Tlc in its apo state. Vector Construction—The coding sequence for human tear lipocalin, comprising residues 5-157 of the mature LCN1 gene product (7Redl B. Holzfeind P. Lottspeich F. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 20282-20287Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), was amplified from plasmid pQE70/Lcn1 (19Holzfeind P. Merschak P. Rogatsch H. Culig Z. Feichtinger H. Klocker H. Redl B. FEBS Lett. 1996; 395: 95-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) via PCR according to a published procedure (20Skerra A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 3551-3554Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), using primers 5′-CCG CCT CAG ACG AGG AGA TTC AG-3′ and 5′-GCT CCC TGG AGA GCA GGT TTC GC-3′. The unique amplification product was purified by agarose gel electrophoresis, phosphorylated with T4 polynucleotide kinase (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA), and ligated with the expression vector pASK75-strepII (21Skerra A. Gene (Amst.). 1994; 151: 131-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar) that had been cut with StuI and Eco47III and dephosphorylated using shrimp alkaline phosphatase (U. S. Biochemical Corp.). After transformation of E. coli XL1-Blue, the plasmid was isolated, and its composition was confirmed by restriction digest as well as double-stranded dideoxy sequencing (ABI PRISM 310 Genetic Analyzer, Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). On the resulting vector, which was designated pTlc2, the truncated Tlc was encoded as a fusion protein with the N-terminal OmpA signal peptide and with the C-terminal Strep-tag II of nine residues. The codon for the unpaired Cys-101 (numbering according to the mature full-length protein) was subsequently replaced by a Ser codon via site-directed mutagenesis (22Geisselsoder J. Witney F. Yuckenberg P. BioTechniques. 1987; 5: 786-790Google Scholar) with the oligodeoxynucleotide 5′-AGC TCG CCC TCA GAG TAA AAG ATG TAG TG-3′ and yielding the vector pTlc3, which was used throughout this study. Protein Production and Purification—Recombinant Tlc was produced in the E. coli K12 strain JM83 (23Yanisch-Perron C. Vieira J. Messing J. Gene (Amst.). 1985; 33: 103-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (11449) Google Scholar) harboring pTlc3 via secretion into the bacterial periplasm. Cultures (2 liters) were grown in LB medium (24Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) supplemented with 100 mg/liter ampicillin at 22 °C. Gene expression was induced at a cell density of A550 = 0.5 by adding 0.2 mg/liter anhydrotetracycline (21Skerra A. Gene (Amst.). 1994; 151: 131-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). After further shaking for 3 h, the cells were harvested by centrifugation, resuspended in 0.5 m sucrose, 1 mm EDTA, 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and kept on ice for 30 min. The resulting spheroplasts were sedimented by centrifugation, and the supernatant containing the recombinant protein was recovered. The protein extract was dialyzed against 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and applied to a column with immobilized engineered streptavidin (25Skerra A. Schmidt T.G. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 326: 271-304Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) by using the same buffer. The recombinant Tlc was competitively eluted by application of 2.5 mm d-desthiobiotin in the chromatography buffer. Elution fractions were concentrated, applied to a Superdex 75 gel filtration column (Amersham Biosciences), equilibrated with 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, as running buffer, and eluted in a homogeneous peak corresponding to the monomeric protein. The yield was ∼1.5 mg of purified protein per 1 liter of E. coli culture. SeMet-labeled Tlc was produced in the same manner by shutting down endogenous Met biosynthesis of E. coli in the presence of the amino acid derivative (26Van Duyne G.D. Standaert R.F. Karplus P.A. Schreiber S.L. Clardy J. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 229: 105-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (1082) Google Scholar, 27Gassner, N. C. (1998) Structural, thermodynamic and kinetic analysis of T4 lysozyme variants with methionine cores., Ph.D. thesis, University of OregonGoogle Scholar). To this end, the culture was grown in M9 minimal medium (24Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) supplemented with 0.4% (w/v) glucose, 1 mm MgSO4, 200 mg/liter l-Pro, 10 mg/liter thiamin, and 100 mg/liter ampicillin at 22 °C. l-Lys, l-Thr, l-Phe (100 mg/liter each), l-Leu, l-Ile, l-Val (50 mg/liter each), and l-SeMet (25 mg/liter) were added at a cell density of A550 = 0.5. After 15 min of incubation, gene expression was induced by adding 0.2 mg/liter anhydrotetracycline. The cells were harvested after further shaking at 22 °C for 14 h, and recombinant Tlc was purified as above. Gel filtration proved to be dispensable due to the high purity after Strep-tag chromatography and to the higher yield ∼2.5 mg of purified recombinant protein per 1 liter of E. coli culture, probably as a result of the longer induction period. SeMet incorporation was verified by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight-mass spectrometry. Crystallization and Data Collection—Crystals of native as well as SeMet-labeled Tlc were grown using the hanging drop vapor diffusion technique by mixing 3 μl of protein solution (10 mg/ml, dialyzed against 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0) with 1 μl of precipitant solution on a siliconized glass coverslip, followed by equilibration against 0.5 ml of the precipitant solution. Several crystals were obtained at 12 °C in the presence of 60% (w/v) ethylene glycol, 200 mm zinc acetate, 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0-7.9, after about 6 weeks. Protein crystals were harvested directly from the drop using Nylon loops (Hampton Research, Laguna Niguel, CA), cryo-protected by transfer to a drop of Paratone N (Hampton Research), thereby removing excessive mother liquor, and frozen in a 100 K nitrogen stream (Oxford Cryosystems, Oxford, UK). Native diffraction data (Table I) were collected at the SLS beamline PX1 (PSI, Villigen, Switzerland). A three-wavelength anomalous data set of the SeMet derivative (Table I) was collected at the synchrotron beamline BM14 (ESRF, Grenoble, France).

Miller R. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1999; 32: 120-124Crossref Scopus (384) Google Scholar) using anomalous peak data, whereby three of the four SeMet sites that had to be expected from the primary structure were identified. Phasing was carried out with SHARP (30de la Fortelle E. Bricogne G. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 472-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (1797) Google Scholar) by using the three SeMet sites and the anomalous data from all three wavelengths (Table I) to a resolution of 1.8 Å. Solvent flattening was subsequently performed with SOLOMON (32Abrahams J.P. Leslie A.G.W. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1996; 52: 30-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (1141) Google Scholar) by using a solvent content of 45%. A partial structural model, comprising the β-barrel and the α-helix but lacking residues in the loop regions and at both polypeptide termini, was calculated with ARPwARP (33Lamzin V.S. Wilson K.S. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1993; 49: 129-149Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) as implemented in SHARP. Missing residues were then added in several sessions of manual rebuilding with QUANTA (34Oldfield T.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2001; 57: 82-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), alternating with restrained refinement cycles using REFMAC 5 (28P4 CC Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19730) Google Scholar). During this process three coordinated zinc ions and two chloride ions were identified and added to the model. Final refinement was carried out with the native data set of a crystal grown at pH 7.0. At this pH, two previously missing residues (Asn-32 and Leu-33) in loop 1 appeared in the electron density map and were built accordingly. Water molecules were added where stereochemically plausible, and the 2Fo - Fc and Fo - Fc difference Fourier maps revealed densities of more than 1.0 and 3.5 σ, respectively. The backbone dihedral angles fall mostly into the favored regions of the Ramachandran plot. The only exception is residue Leu-33, which is situated C-terminal to the disordered part of loop 1 and has only weak electron density. Analysis of the Crystal Structure—The few missing residues at the tips of loop 2 (Leu-56 and Ile-57) and loop 4 (Leu-105 and His-106) were inserted in QUANTA (34Oldfield T.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2001; 57: 82-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) with plausible stereochemistry (using the “regularize range” option). In order to model the stretch of seven residues in loop 1 without clear electron density (Asp-25 to Met-31), the Protein Data Bank was searched for a loop with identical length and matching conformation of the well resolved flanking segments (C-α positions 21-23 and 33-35, respectively) using INSIGHT II (Accelrys, San Diego, CA). One nicely fitting peptide segment, corresponding to residues 117-125 of actophorin (PDB accession code 1CNU), was found and grafted onto the Tlc stump using least squares superposition of the flanking segments. Side chains were subsequently adjusted to match the Tlc sequence and oriented in standard conformation (35Ponder J.W. Richards F.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1987; 193: 775-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (1349) Google Scholar). The completed model was subjected to one round of refinement using REFMAC 5 with the occupancy of all three amended segments (residues 25-31, 56 and 57, and 105 and 106) set to 0.01, resulting in an R-factor of 19.6% and Rfree of 25.4%. There were no structural clashes due to the new residues. Notably, the modeled loop 1 partly adopted a similar orientation as the corresponding loop of the lipocalin Bda, though shorter by two residues (see text). Graphical representations were prepared using MOLSCRIPT (36Kraulis P.J. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1991; 24: 946-950Crossref Google Scholar), RASTER3D (37Merrit E.A. Bacon D.J. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 277: 505-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (3873) Google Scholar), and PyMOL (www.pymol.org). Secondary structure assignments were made with DSSP (39Kabsch W. Sander C. Biopolymers. 1983; 22: 2577-2637Crossref PubMed Scopus (12181) Google Scholar) and extracted with MAKEMOLS (40Holm L. Protein Data Bank Newsletter. 1995; 71: 6-9Google Scholar). For use with MOLSCRIPT, electron densities were converted from CCP4 format (28P4 CC Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19730) Google Scholar) with MINIMAGE (41Arnez J.G. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1994; 27: 649-653Crossref Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Molecular surfaces were either prepared with PyMOL or calculated with GRASP (42Nicholls A. Sharp K.A. Honig B. Proteins. 1991; 11: 281-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (5314) Google Scholar) and exported for use in MOLSCRIPT with a modified version of UNGRASP (37Merrit E.A. Bacon D.J. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 277: 505-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (3873) Google Scholar). Superpositions were made with LSQMAN (43Kleywegt G.J. Zou J.Y. Kjeldgaard M. Jones T.A. Rossmann M.G. Arnold E. International Tables for Crystallography. F. Kluwer Academic Publishers Group, Dordrecht, Netherlands2001: 353-367Google Scholar). Ligand complexes were modeled using INSIGHT II. The crystallographic coordinates of the apo-Tlc structure (without the modeled segments) have been deposited at the Protein Data Bank (44Berman H.M. Westbrook J. Feng Z. Gilliland G. Bhat T.N.

One-step purification from the bacterial periplasmic extract was achieved by streptavidin affinity chromatography via the Strep-tag II (25Skerra A. Schmidt T.G. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 326: 271-304Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which had been fused to the C terminus. Tlc was finally isolated as a homogeneous monomeric protein by gel filtration. Crystallization of Tlc was achieved at pH 7.9 with ethylene glycol as precipitant in the presence of zinc acetate. The crystal structure was determined by multiple wavelength anomalous diffraction phasing after in vivo labeling with selenomethionine (SeMet). Refinement against a data set for a crystal of the native protein, grown under similar conditions at pH 7.0, resulted in an R-factor of 18.9% and an Rfree of 25.4% with good stereochemistry (Table II). One molecule of the apoprotein was found in the asymmetric unit. The quality of the electron density map at a resolution of 1.8 Å allowed us to unambiguously build 128 of the 152 residues of the recombinant Tlc (neglecting the Strep-tag II).Table IIRefinement statisticsResolution (Å)42.64-1.80R/Rfree (resolution shell)18.9/25.4 (42.64-1.80)25.6/30.2 (1.85-1.80)Protein residues present162Protein residues visible128No. solvent molecules146No. zinc ions3No. chloride ions2R.m.s. deviation from ideality of bond lengths (Å)0.015R.m.s. deviation from ideality of bond angles (°)2.215Average B values (Å2)Protein33.0Solvent48.3Zinc29.5Chloride27.0 Open table in a new tab The N-terminal residues Ala-5 to Gln-11 and the C-terminal residues starting from Glu-151, including the Strep-tag II (residues 158-166), were disordered. The disulfide bond joining Cys-61 and Cys-153 was also not fully resolved in the electron density and hence was omitted from the model. Residues Asp-25 to Met-31, which form the long first loop connecting β-strands A and B at the open end of the β-barrel and partially cover the calyx in other lipocalins (e.g. bovine dander allergen Bos d 2 (45Rouvinen J. Rautiainen J. Virtanen T. Zeiler T. Kauppinen J. Taivainen A. Mantyjarvi R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2337-2343Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar)), were largely disordered. Furthermore, small pieces of electron density were missing at the tips of loop 2 connecting strands C/D (Leu-56 and Ile-57) and of loop 4 connecting strands G/H (Leu-105 and His-106). Adjacent residues had elevated temperature factors but could be built unambiguously. Hence, as in other lipocalins the β-barrel of Tlc appears rather rigid, whereas extended loops and extraneous terminal segments of the polypeptide chain seem to be more flexible, probably also due to a lack of stabilizing crystal contacts. For purposes of illustration, the missing loop segments at the entrance to the ligand pocket were modeled with plausible stereochemistry (for details see “Experimental Procedures”) and included in the Tlc structure described here. Structure of Tear Lipocalin—Tlc exhibits the typical lipocalin fold, consisting of an eight-stranded, strictly antiparallel β-barrel that forms a central cavity. The cavity opens to one end of the barrel, where four loops (loops 1-4) connect neighboring β-strands (dubbed A-H) in a pairwise manner (Fig. 1). A C-terminal α-helix (residues Leu-127 to Ala-136), which is followed by an almost extended peptide segment (strand I), packs against one side of the β-barrel. The N-terminal peptide segment of Tlc covers the bottom of the barrel between the loops connecting strands B/C and F/G and thereby buries Trp-17, one of the few residues conserved in all lipocalins (8Flower D.R. Biochem. J. 1996; 318: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (1374) Google Scholar). Three of the loops at the open end of the β-barrel are rather long and partially disordered in the crystal structure, hence allowing access to the central cavity even for voluminous ligands. In particular, the Ω-type loop 1 with its 13 residues is one of the largest loops among the prototypic lipocalins that have been structurally characterized so far (16Skerra A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1482: 337-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). On its N-terminal side, this loop is likely to form a short α-helix comparable with those observed in Bda and Blg (Fig. 2). Loops 2 and 4 appear as β-hairpins, whereas the tip of the rather short loop 3 connecting β-strands E/F (cf. Fig. 1A) locally assumes the conformation of a 310-helix (residues Asp-80 to Gly-82). Even though Tlc represents one of the smallest members of the lipocalin family, with 158 residues for the native, mature polypeptide (cf.Fig. 2), it exhibits an unusually large cavity inside its β-barrel. Nevertheless, the β-barrel itself, with the three loops that tie it up at its closed end and with the α-helix attached to it, appears conformationally rigid and is nicely superimposable to the supersecondary structure of other lipocalins. Most interestingly, apart from the wide mouth"
https://openalex.org/W2167192576,"Interferon regulatory factor-1 (IRF-1) and interferon consensus sequence-binding protein (ICSBP or IRF-8) are two members of the IRF family of transcription factors that play critical roles in interferon signaling in a wide range of host responses to infection and malignancy. Interleukin-12 (IL-12) is a key factor in the induction of innate resistance and generation of T helper type 1 cells and cytotoxic T lymphocytes. In this work, we find that ICSBP-deficient macrophages are highly defective in the production of IL-12. The defect is also observed at the level of IL-12 p40 and p35 mRNA expression. Transcriptional analyses revealed that ICSBP is a potent activator of the IL-12 p35 gene. It acts through a site localized to –226 to –219, named ICSBP-response element (ICSBP-RE), in the human IL-12 p35 promoter through physical association with IRF-1 both in vitro and in vivo. Co-expression of ICSBP and IRF-1 synergistically stimulates the IL-12 p35 promoter activity. Mutations at the ICSBP-RE results in the loss of protein binding as well as transcriptional activation by ICSBP alone or together with IRF-1. This study provides novel mechanistic information on how signals initiated during innate and adaptive immune responses synergize to yield greater IL-12 production and sustained cellular immunity.

Members of IRF family are typically induced following microbial infections. The first discovered member of this family, IRF-1, has a remarkable functional diversity in the regulation of cellular response in host defense. IRF-1 selectively targets different sets of genes in various cell types in response to diverse cellular stimuli and evokes appropriate innate and adaptive immune responses (1Taniguchi T. Ogasawara K. Takaoka A. Tanaka N. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2001; 19: 623-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (1277) Google Scholar). It has been firmly established as a critical effector molecule in IFN-γ-mediated signaling and in the development and function of NK, NK T cells, and cytotoxic T lymphocytes (2Matsuyama T. Kimura T.

Interferon consensus sequence-binding protein (ICSBP)/IRF-8 is restricted in its expression to myeloid and lymphoid cell lineages. It can function both as a transcriptional repressor and an activator depending on the partners with which it interacts, and it plays crucial roles in myeloid differentiation, generation of plasmacytoid dendritic cells (8Tsujimura H. Tamura T. Ozato K. J. Immunol. 2003; 170: 1131-1135Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar), macrophage activation, and tumor suppression (1Taniguchi T. Ogasawara K. Takaoka A. Tanaka N. Annu.

Blood. 2003; 102: 4547-4554Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). IL-12 is a heterodimeric cytokine produced primarily by macrophages and dendritic cells in both innate and adaptive immune responses. It is a key factor in the induction of T cell-dependent and independent activation of macrophages, NK cells, generation of T helper type 1 cells and CTL, induction of opsonic complement-fixing antibodies, and resistance to intracellular infections (10Trinchieri G. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1995; 13: 251-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (2222) Google Scholar). The genes encoding the two heterologous chains of IL-12, p40 and p35, are located on different human and mouse chromosomes. Together, p40 and p35 form the biologically active IL-12 (also called p70). The highly coordinated expression of p40 and p35 genes to form IL-12 p70 in the same cell type at the same time is essential for the initiation of an effective immune response. The production of IL-12 p40 in activated professional antigen-presenting cells is generally in great excess over that of the p35 chain, making the latter molecule a limiting step in the formation of bioactive IL-12 (11Snijders A. Hilkens C.M. van der Pouw Kraan T.C. Engel M. Aarden L.A. Kapsenberg M.L. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 1207-1212PubMed Google Scholar). Previous studies by us and others have revealed an intimate relationship between IRF-1, ICSBP, and IL-12 in that IRF-1 acts as a critical component of IFN-γ signaling in the selective activation of the IL-12 p35 transcription (12Liu J. Cao S. Herman L.M. Ma X. J. Exp. Med. 2003; 198: 1265-1276Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar) in synergy with LPS-mediated events (13Grumont R. Hochrein H. O'Keeffe M. Gugasyan R. White C.

Tamaoki S. Wang I.M. Ozato K. Komuro K. FEBS Lett. 2002; 531: 348-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 16Wang I.M. Contursi C. Masumi A. Ma X. Trinchieri G. Ozato K. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 271-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). In this work, we show that ICSBP and IRF-1, activated primarily by IFN-γ, also cooperate in their transcriptional activation of the IL-12 p35 gene by directly binding to a specific site in the human IL-12 p35 promoter. This study provides additional mechanistic information regarding how innate and adaptive immune activation jointly lead to greater IL-12 production and persistent inflammatory responses. Mice—ICSBP–/– mice breeding pair were originally obtained from Dr. Keiko Ozato (National Institutes of Health). All of the mice used in the experiment were female and 6–8 weeks old. Mice were housed in cages with filter tops in a laminar flow hood and fed food and acid water ad libitum. Cells—The murine macrophage cell line RAW 264.7 (RAW cells hereafter) was obtained from American Type Culture Collection and maintained in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 2 mm glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin and streptomycin, and 10% FBS (endotoxin <1 ng/ml; Hyclone). Mouse inflammatory peritoneal exudate macrophages were obtained by lavage 4 days after injection of sterile 3% thioglycolate broth (1 ml of intraperitoneal). Cells were washed and resuspended in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% fetal calf serum and standard supplements. Macrophages were plated in 24-well tissue culture dishes (0.5 × 106 cells/well). After 2 h of incubation to allow for adherence of macrophages, monolayers were washed three times to remove nonadherent cells and incubated with RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% fetal calf serum and standard supplements. The next day, some of the wells were treated with 1 μg/ml LPS and 10 ng/ml IFN-γ in a final volume of 1 ml or 10 ng/ml IFNγ first for 16 h (priming) followed by LPS. Human blood derived-monocytes were isolated from fresh blood by Ficoll/Hypaque gradient centrifugation. Mononuclear cells were incubated for 1 h in polystyrene tissue culture flasks (Falcon, BD Biosciences). After 1 h of incubation to allow for adherence of monocytes, monolayers were washed three times to remove nonadherent cells and incubated with RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% fetal calf serum and standard supplements. The treatment of human monocytes is the same as above unless otherwise stated. Reagents—All of the antibodies used in this study were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. Expression vector ICSBP and control LK440 were provided by Keiko Ozato. All of the plasmid DNA were prepared with Qiagen Endo-free Maxi-Prep kits. Recombinant human and murine IFN-γ was purchased from Genzyme (Boston, MA). LPS from Escherichia coli 0217:B8 and thioglycolate medium were purchased from Sigma. ELISA—Supernatants from macrophage cultures were harvested at 6, 12, and 24 h after LPS stimulation and stored at –70 °C. Mouse IL-12 p40 and p70 were detected by using the OPT-EIA ELISA kit (BD Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Concentrations were calculated by regression analysis of a standard curve. RNase Protection Assay (RPA)—Mouse peritoneal macrophages were pretreated with IFN-γ for 16 h followed by treatment with LPS for an additional 4 h. 10 μg of total RNA for each determination was subjected to a multiprobe RNase protection kit (BD Biosciences), mCK2b, for mouse according to the manufacturer's instructions. Quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR)—To determine the level of IL-12 p35 mRNA by quantitative real time PCR, we used a modified protocol from Rajeevan et al. (17Rajeevan M.S. Ranamukhaarachchi D.G. Vernon S.D. Unger E.R. Methods. 2001; 25: 443-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). cDNA converted from 1 μg of total RNA was diluted in a several concentrations. Diluted cDNA was mixed with a pair of primers (10 μm) derived from mouse IL-12 p35 or glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase cDNA sequences and SYBR green PCR master mixture (Applied Biosystem) in a 15-μl volume. PCR cycling was performed as follows: 2 min at 50 °C; 10 min at 95 °C for 1 cycle followed by 40 cycles at 15 s at 95 °C; and 1 min at 60 °C. The PCR primers used were: forward primer, 5′-AAATGAAGCTCTGCATCCTGC-3′, and reverse primer, 5′-TCACCCTGTTGATGGTCACG-3′, for mouse IL-12 p35; forward primer, 5′-AACT TTGGCATTGTGGAAGG-3′, and reverse primer, 5′-ACACATTGGGGGTAGGAACA-3′, for mouse glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase. Nuclear Extract Preparation—Nuclear extracts for Western blot and DNA affinity binding assay were prepared according to the methods of Schreiber et al. (18Schreiber E. Matthias P. Muller M.M. Schaffner W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 6419Crossref PubMed Scopus (3912) Google Scholar). Western Blotting—SDS-PAGE was performed according to Laemmli (19Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206631) Google Scholar). Gels were electroblotted to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes and blocked in 5% milk in Tris buffer, pH 8.0. Primary antibody was added at the concentration of 1 μg/ml in Tris buffer containing 1% milk powder and left overnight at 4 °C. After extensive washing, secondary antibody conjugated to horseradish peroxidase was added at a 1:5000 dilution in 5% milk. After extensive washing, blots were subjected to enhanced chemiluminescence detection (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Transfection Assay—Transient transfections were performed by electroporation as described previously (20Ma X. Chow J.M. Gri G. Carra G. Gerosa F. Wolf S.F. Dzialo R. Trinchieri G. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 183: 147-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (579) Google Scholar). DNA Affinity Binding Assay—Complementary biotinylated oligonucleotides encompassing the human IL-12 p35 promoter ICSBP-RE (–235/–208) or the mutant ICSBP-RE were synthesized and annealed. 4 μg of biotinylated double-stranded DNA were conjugated to 200 μl of streptavidin-bound magnetic beads (Dynabeads, M280; Dynal) in binding/washing buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1 m NaCl) for 30 min at room temperature. Unconjugated DNA was collected with a magnetic particle concentrator. DNA-conjugated beads were then blocked by 0.5% bovine serum albumin in TGEDN buffer (120 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1 m NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol) at room temperature for 1 h. Beads were washed once in TGEDN buffer and resuspended in 100 μl of TGEDN. 20-μl beads conjugated to 4 μg of DNA were equilibrated with TGEDN buffer and incubated with 1000 μg of RAW cell nuclear extracts and 20 μg of herring sperm DNA (Sigma) at 4 °C for 2 h. Beads were washed in TGEDN buffer, and bound materials were eluted in 20 μl of the same buffer supplemented with 0.5% SDS and 1 m NaCl. Eluted materials and unconjugated protein were separated by 12% SDS-PAGE and detected by immunoblot analysis using rabbit anti-IRF-1 antibody with the enhanced chemiluminescence kit. Nuclear extracts were prepared from RAW cells treated with 10 ng/ml IFN-γ for 16 h followed by incubation with LPS alone or plus IFN-γ for an additional 4 h. Co-immunoprecipitation—RAW 264.7 cells were activated with 10 ng/ml IFN-γ for 5 h. The cells then were washed with cold phosphate-buffered saline, and nuclear extract was harvested. The nuclear extract was precleared by adding 20 μl of protein G-agarose and incubating at 4 °C for 1 h on a rocker. Precleared nuclear extract (500 μg) was incubated with 2 μg of IRF-1 or ICSBP antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) in the presence of 20 μl of 50% (v/v) protein G-agarose overnight at 4 °C with gentle rocking. After three washings with phosphate-buffered saline, precipitated complexes were solubilized by boiling in SDS buffer, fractionated by 12% SDS-PAGE, and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. Western blotting was performed using an ICSBP or IRF-1 antibody. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP) Assay—The ChIP procedure was performed using an assay kit according to the manufacturer's instructions (Upstate Biotechnology). 107 human peripheral blood monocytes were stimulated with 10 ng/ml IFN-γ priming and 1 μg/ml LPS or alone and cross-linked by 1% formaldehyde for 10 min at 37 °C. Nuclei were prepared and subjected to sonication to obtain DNA fragments ranging from 200 to 1000 bp. Chromatin fractions were precleared with protein G-agarose beads followed by immunoprecipitation overnight at 4 °C with 2 μg of anti-IRF-1 antibody or anti-ICSBP antibody and its control antibody. Cross-linking was reversed for4hat 65 °C and was followed by proteinase K digestion. DNA was purified and subjected to PCR. The input DNA was diluted 200 times before PCR. The input and precipitated DNA were PCR-amplified by primers encompassing the ICSBP site in the human IL-12 p35 promoter (5′ primer, 5′-GCGAACATTTCGCTTTCATT-3′, and 3′ primer, 5′-ACTTTCCCGGGACTCTGGT-3′) in a buffer containing 2 mm MgCl2. The samples were amplified for 34 cycles by PCR and analyzed by electrophoresis on a 1.2% agarose gel or analyzed by quantitative real-time PCR as described above. Statistical Analysis—Student's t test was performed wherever applicable. Mean ± S.D. is shown unless otherwise indicated. IL-12 p40 and p70 Production Is Defective in ICSBP–/–mice—To determine the role of ICSBP in the regulation of IL-12 production, we obtained inflammatory peritoneal macrophages from ICSBP–/– mice (on C57BL/6 background) and control wild type animals and stimulated them in vitro with LPS or primed with IFN-γ followed by LPS stimulation. IL-12 p40 and p70 production at various times over a period of 24 h was measured by specific ELISA. Because of the lack of a p35-speicifc ELISA due to the fact that it is secreted only as a heterodimer, the measurement of p70 production is a generally accepted indicator of IL-12 p35 production due to the one to one ratio of the p40-p35 interaction. As shown in Fig. 1, IL-12 p40 production stimulated by LPS alone (A) or IFN-γ plus LPS (B) was strongly impaired in ICSBP–/– macrophages compared with wild type or ICSBP+/– cells. Similarly, IL-12 p70 production induced by LPS (C) or IFN-γ plus LPS (D) was virtually absent in ICSBP–/– cells. These results indicate that ICSBP is an essential regulator of IL-12 p40 and p70 production. IL-12 p40 and p35 mRNA Expression Is Impaired in ICSBP–/–Macrophages—To determine the effects of ICSBP deficiency on IL-12 p40 and p35 gene expression, we examined their steady-state mRNA expression by RPA and by qRT-PCR. The RPA (Fig. 2A) shows that the level of IL-12 p40 mRNA induced by LPS alone or IFN-γ plus LPS was comparable between wild type and ICSBP+/– peritoneal macrophages (lane 3 versus lane 7 and lane 4 versus lane 8), whereas its level was significantly reduced in ICSBP–/– cells activated by IFN-γ and LPS (lanes 4 and 8 versus lane 12), a result consistent with our previous finding (16Wang I.M. Contursi C. Masumi A. Ma X. Trinchieri G. Ozato K. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 271-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). IL-12 p35 mRNA levels were reduced in ICSBP–/– cells activated with LPS alone (lane 11) or IFN-γ plus LPS (lane 12). The qRT-PCR analysis (Fig. 2B) shows more definitively that both LPS- and IFN-γ/LPS-induced IL-12 p35 mRNA levels were drastically reduced in ICSBP–/– macrophages. These data strongly indicate that ICSBP regulates both IL-12 p40 and p35 mRNA expression. ICSBP Activates the IL-12 p35 Gene Transcription through a Proximal Promoter Region—We had previously established the molecular mechanism whereby ICSBP regulates IL-12 p40 gene transcription (16Wang I.M. Contursi C. Masumi A. Ma X. Trinchieri G. Ozato K. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 271-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). In this work, we sought to elucidate how ICSBP regulates IL-12 p35 gene transcription by first examining the response of the human IL-12 p35 promoter to the effects of ICSBP in a well established transient transfection system in RAW cells (12Liu J. Cao S. Herman L.M. Ma X. J. Exp. Med. 2003; 198: 1265-1276Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Fig. 3A shows that ICSBP expression stimulated the IL-12 p35 promoter-driven luciferase activity in a dose-dependent manner in RAW cells under all conditions, but by far the greatest stimulation was seen in IFN-γ/LPS-activated cells (filled diamonds). Note that, although difficult to discern in this graph because of the relatively low scale, the IL-12 p35 promoter was highly inducible by IFN-γ and LPS (10–20-fold) without exogenous ICSBP, as is the case here and as we have shown previously (12Liu J. Cao S. Herman L.M. Ma X. J. Exp. Med. 2003; 198: 1265-1276Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). An analysis of endogenous ICSBP protein expression revealed that ICSBP was primarily induced by IFN-γ in the nucleus, not in the cytoplasm, and that LPS treatment alone had little effect (Fig. 3B). These data clearly demonstrate the ability of ICSBP, primarily as an IFN-γ-inducible transcription factor, to activate IL-12 p35 gene transcription. To further explore the molecular mechanism whereby IFNγ regulates IL-12 p35 transcription through ICSBP, we dissected the human IL-12 p35 promoter by sequentially deleting the full-length promoter, a 1143-bp genomic fragment (12Liu J. Cao S. Herman L.M. Ma X. J. Exp. Med. 2003; 198: 1265-1276Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar), from the 5′ end. The transcriptional start site of the human IL-12 p35 gene in macrophages has been mapped previously (21Hayes M.P. Murphy F.J. Burd P.R. Blood. 1998; 91: 4645-4651Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Because ICSBP is primarily induced by IFN-γ, not LPS treatment, in macrophages (Fig. 3B), we stimulated RAW 264.7 cells with LPS in all of our transfection studies to provide the other essential set of transcription factors for maximally induced IL-12 p35 gene expression (12Liu J. Cao S. Herman L.M. Ma X. J. Exp. Med. 2003; 198: 1265-1276Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 3C, the full-length IL-12 p35 promoter (–1082 to +61) was highly responsive to stimulation by ICSBP in resting cells (∼8-fold compared with control vector-transfected cells) and in LPS-activated cells (∼27-fold). Sequential deletion of the full-length promoter down to –231 had no adverse impact on the inducibility of the p35 promoter by ICSBP. Note that the –231/+61 construct has lost a previously identified element, IRF-E-(–245 to –236), that is critical for response to IRF-1 (12Liu J. Cao S. Herman L.M. Ma X. J. Exp. Med. 2003; 198: 1265-1276Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). The loss of the IRF-E apparently had no effect on the response to ICSBP. A further deletion of 17 bp (to –214) resulted in a moderate loss of the ICSBP response in resting cells and a dramatic loss of response in LPS-stimulated cells, indicating the presence of a critical cis-element(s) in this region involved in response to ICSBP. By this approach, we identified the 17-bp region between –231 and –214 as a site containing a ICSBP-RE. Within this region, the GeneTool™ program (Double Twist, now defunct) predicted an IFN-γ-regulated element consensus sequence (γ-IRE_CS), 5′-CTGGAGGC-3′, from –225 to –219. Localization of ICSBP-RE—To assess whether the predicted sequence 5′-CTGGAGGC-3′ located at –226 to –219 was critical for ICSBP response, we introduced 2-bp substitutions into this site in the context of the –231/+61 of the IL-12 p35 promoter and measured their response to ICSBP by transfection into RAW 264.7 cells treated with LPS. One of the substitution mutants (Fig. 4A) showed a different response from the wild type control in that the mutation reduced the ability by >70% of the –231/+61 IL-12 p35 promoter to stimulation by the co-transfected ICSBP without LPS (Fig. 4B, compare column 3 with column 1), similarly to the 5′-deletion construct of –214/+61 that has lost the entire 17-bp region including the ICSBP-RE (column 5). Secondary to that, the LPS-induced promoter activity of the mutant was also reduced proportionally (compare column 4 with column 2). ICSBP and IRF-1 Physically Interact and Synergize to Activate IL-12 p35 Transcription—Given the data shown in Fig. 4, we were interested in understanding the physical aspect of the ICSBP activity, i.e. DNA-protein interactions at the ICSBP-RE. However, by conventional electrophoretic mobility shift assay, we were unable to detect significant DNA binding activity at this site. We reasoned that this may be because of the low levels or low affinity of nuclear binding proteins that could specifically recognize this DNA element. Thus, we resorted to the DNA affinity binding assay, which allows the detection of low affinity or low levels of nuclear binding activities (12Liu J. Cao S. Herman L.M. Ma X. J. Exp. Med. 2003; 198: 1265-1276Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 16Wang I.M. Contursi C. Masumi A. Ma X. Trinchieri G. Ozato K. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 271-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). By this method, we still could not detect the presence of ICSBP. Surprisingly, we saw weak IRF-1 binding to this site in response to IFN-γ and LPS in a sequence-specific manner since the mutant probe failed to recognize the binding (Fig. 5A). This result was corroborated by co-immunoprecipitation, which showed that an anti-IRF-1 IgG was able to pull down ICSBP in IFN-γ-stimulated RAW 264.7 cells (Fig. 5B, top panel) or by reciprocal co-immunoprecipitation with anti-ICSBP (Fig. 5B, bottom), demonstrating their co-presence in the same complex that interacts with the ICSBP-RE (not necessarily directly interacting), as is the case in IL-12 p40 gene transcription (16Wang I.M. Contursi C. Masumi A. Ma X. Trinchieri G. Ozato K. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 271-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). The above results led us to reason that IRF-1 may be involved in ICSBP-stimulated IL-12 p35 transcription. We tested this hypothesis by determining whether ICSBP and IRF-1 could stimulate IL-12 p35 transcription synergistically. Fig. 5C shows that the full-length IL-12 p35 promoter (–1083/+61) was synergistically activated by exogenous ICSBP and IRF-1 but only in LPS-stimulated cells, not in resting cells. The –231/+61 construct was also synergistically activated by ICSBP and IRF-1 (Fig. 5D). Moreover, this synergy was dependent on the ICSBP-RE because the ICSBP-RE mutant lost significantly its ability to respond to ICSBP and IRF-1 synergistically (Fig. 5D). ICSBP and IRF-1 Both Bind to the ICSBP-RE in Vivo in Activated Primary Monocytes—To determine whether ICSBP and IRF-1 could bind to the endogenous IL-12 p35 promoter at the ICSBP-RE in vivo in primary human monocytes, we performed ChIP using a pair of primers flanking the ICSBP-RE for PCR amplification (Fig. 6A). Fig. 6B shows that both IRF-1 and ICSBP binding to the ICSBP-RE were readily detectable in monocytes stimulated with IFN-γ but not with LPS (the faint band seen in lanes 1 and 2 of the anti-ICSBP panel were likely artifacts because of their different size). The combination of IFN-γ and LPS stimulation further enhanced ICSBP binding (lane 4). These data was further confirmed by qRT-PCR (Fig. 5C) in that both IFN-γ and IFN-γ plus LPS strongly induced ICSBP and IRF-1 binding to the ICSBP-RE. The pattern of the endogenous ICSBP nuclear expression was consistent with its binding activity in vivo (Fig. 5D). These results clearly demonstrate that ICSBP and IRF-1 could bind to the endogenous IL-12 p35 ICSBP-RE in primary monocytes in response principally to IFN-γ stimulation. IFNγ-mediated enhancement of IL-12 production represents the convergence of signals derived from innate and adaptive immune responses. IFN-γ is produced mainly by NK cells during innate responses and by activated T lymphocytes during adaptive immunity. The exposure of professional antigen-presenting cells to IFN-γ activates IRFs including IRF-1 and ICSBP that are critical for maximal IL-12 synthesis when coupled with microbial stimuli such as LPS. This work builds on our previous studies and further elucidates the mechanism whereby the two signals initiated by innate and adaptive stimuli, respectively, converge to induce high levels of IL-12 production and ensure highly active and persistent NK and T helper type 1 responses. The critical role of ICSBP in IL-12 production is illustrated in the observation that IL-12 p35 and p40 mRNA expression is impaired in ICSBP-deficient macrophages (Fig. 2) and that IL-12 p40 synthesis is severely reduced (Fig. 1, A and B), whereas IL-12 p70 production is virtually absent (Fig. 1, C and D). There is a quantitative discrepancy between reduced IL-12 p35 and p40 mRNA expression in ICSBP–/– macrophages on the one hand and the total lack of IL-12 p70 synthesis by these cells on the other. This may be explained by the possibility that the reduced levels of IL-12 p40 and p35 proteins in ICSBP–/– cells fall below a certain “threshold” for the formation of IL-12 heterodimers. Alternatively, although less likely, the ICSBP deficiency causes an indirect effect on the assembly or secretion of the IL-12 p70 heterodimer. Post-translational regulation of IL-12 production has been reported previously (22Babik J.M. Adams E. Tone Y. Fairchild P.J. Tone M. Waldmann H. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 4069-4078PubMed Google Scholar, 23Murphy F.J. Hayes M.P. Burd P.R. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 839-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 24Carra G. Gerosa F. Trinchieri G. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 4752-4761Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). That in our transfection system, LPS coupled with forced ICSBP expression failed to induce significant activation of the IL-12 p35 promoter compared with unstimulated cells (Fig. 3A) is consistent with the fact that IL-12 p35 transcriptional activation also requires IRF-1, which is induced by IFN-γ but not by LPS (12Liu J. Cao S. Herman L.M. Ma X. J. Exp. Med. 2003; 198: 1265-1276Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). It should be stressed that the transcriptional activation of IL-12 p35 requires two signals, one typically provided by LPS and the other by IFN-γ. The LPS-initiated signal induces the activation of such transcription factors as NFκB and Sp-1 that are essential for IL-12 p35 transcription (12Liu J. Cao S. Herman L.M. Ma X. J. Exp. Med. 2003; 198: 1265-1276Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 13Grumont R. Hochrein H. O'Keeffe M. Gugasyan R. White C. Caminschi I. Cook W. Gerondakis S. J. Exp. Med. 2001; 194: 1021-1032Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar, 14Goriely S. Demonte D. Nizet S. De Wit D. Willems F. Goldman M. Van Lint C. Blood. 2003; 101: 4894-4902Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The IFN-γ-initiated signal induces IRF-1 and ICSBP that are critical for IL-12 p35 transcription and p70 production (12Liu J. Cao S. Herman L.M. Ma X. J. Exp. Med. 2003; 198: 1265-1276Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 14Goriely S. Demonte D. Nizet S. De Wit D. Willems F. Goldman M. Van Lint C. Blood. 2003; 101: 4894-4902Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Both signals are necessary (either signal alone is not sufficient) to activate IL-12 p35 transcription. The fact that the ICSBP response of the IL-12 p35 ICSBP-RE mutant promoter was reduced by ∼70% regardless of the absence or presence of LPS (Fig. 4B) suggests that the LPS response of the promoter is not dependent on the integrity of the ICSBP-RE. In other words, the ICSBP and LPS responses of the IL-12 p35 promoter are separate. We were unable to detect a direct interaction of ICSBP with the ICSBP-RE in vitro but able to do so in vivo by ChIP (Fig. 6B). This could be due to a low abundance of ICSBP in the complex or due to the shielding of ICSBP from antibody contact by IRF-1 in vitro. This “hindrance” by IRF-1 may not occur in vivo on the chromatin-wrapped IL-12 p35 promoter because, presumably, the conformation in which IRF-1 and ICSBP bind to the ICSBP-RE in the presence of the surrounding chromatin structures does not obstruct access by their respective antibodies during the ChIP procedure (Fig. 6B). Furthermore, other lines of evidence suggest that ICSBP functionally interact with IRF-1. They can synergize to stimulate IL-12 p35 transcription through the ICSBP-RE (Fig. 5C) by binding together to the ICSBP-RE in vivo (Fig. 6B). It should be pointed out that the ICSBP-RE we identified in the human IL-12 p35 promoter does not look like a conventional IRF-E (GAAA(G/C)(T/C)GAAA(G/C)(T/C)) (25Tanaka N. Kawakami T. Taniguchi T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 4531-4538Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar) or ISRE ((A/G)NGAAANNGAAACT) (26Darnell Jr., J.E. Kerr I.M. Stark G.R. Science. 1994; 264: 1415-1421Crossref PubMed Scopus (4974) Google Scholar). Thus, it is possible that ICSBP may interact with this element through an unidentified factor in addition to IRF-1. A third possibility is that ICSBP could enhance IRF-1 binding to the ICSBP-RE through an intermediary but itself does not come into direct contact with DNA. Based on several studies by us as well as other groups, a model is emerging that schematizes the molecular events that lead to IL-12 production by antigen-presenting cells (Fig. 7 for the IL-12 p35 subunit gene). During the innate phase of an immune response, microbial antigens activate the NFκB pathway via Toll-like receptors (Toll-like receptor 4 for LPS) in a MyD88-dependent manner (27Seki E. Tsutsui H. Tsuji N.M. Hayashi N. Adachi K. Nakano H. Futatsugi-Yumikura S. Takeuchi O. Hoshino K. Akira S. Fujimoto J. Nakanishi K. J.

Immunol. 2002; 169: 3652-3660Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). Activated NFκB alone stimulates moderate transcription of IL-12 p35 and p40 genes primarily through p50 and c-Rel (13Grumont R. Hochrein H. O'Keeffe M. Gugasyan R. White C. Caminschi I. Cook W.

A. 2000; 97: 12705-12710Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). The initial small amount of IL-12 is able to stimulate NK cells to produce IFN-γ. IFN-γ can also be produced by activated T cells. IFN-γ then activates IRF-1 and ICSBP, which can bind two sites in the IL-12 p35 promoter, either alone to the IRF-E by IRF-1 (12Liu J. Cao S. Herman L.M. Ma X. J. Exp. Med. 2003; 198: 1265-1276Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar) or together (ICSBP-RE, Figs. 5 and 6), resulting in much greater levels of transcription of IL-12 p40 (16Wang I.M. Contursi C. Masumi A. Ma X. Trinchieri G. Ozato K. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 271-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar) and p35 genes (12Liu J. Cao S. Herman L.M. Ma X. J. Exp. Med. 2003; 198: 1265-1276Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar) and the production of IL-12. The combined activity of IFN-γ and LPS also leads to the activation of Sp1 and its binding to a site in the p35 promoter as part of selective remodeling of a single nucleosome within the –310 to –160 region (14Goriely S. Demonte D. Nizet S. De Wit D. Willems F. Goldman M. Van Lint C. Blood. 2003; 101: 4894-4902Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The combination of signals derived from innate and adaptive immune events stimulate synergistically the production of IL-12 and sustain the inflammatory response and cell-mediated immunity against pathogens."
https://openalex.org/W1992920378,"The importance of the interplay between degassing and crystallization before and after the eruption of Mount St. Helens (Washington, USA) in 1980 is well established. Here, we show that degassing occurred over a period of decades to days before eruptions and that the manner of degassing, as deduced from geochemical signatures within the magma, was characteristic of the eruptive style. Trace element (lithium) and short-lived radioactive isotope (lead-210 and radium-226) data show that ascending magma stalled within the conduit, leading to the accumulation of volatiles and the formation of lead-210 excesses, which signals the presence of degassing magma at depth."
https://openalex.org/W2119088930,"The low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein (LRP) mediates the endocytic clearance of various proteinases and proteinase·inhibitor complexes, including thrombospondin (TSP)-dependent endocytosis of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2 (or gelatinase A), a key effector of extracellular matrix remodeling and cancer progression. However, the zymogen of MMP-2 (pro-MMP-2) mostly occurs in tissues as a complex with the tissue inhibitor of MMPs (TIMP-2). Here we show that clearance of the pro-MMP-2·TIMP-2 complex is also mediated by LRP, because addition of receptor-associated protein (RAP), a natural LRP ligand antagonist, inhibited endocytosis and lysosomal degradation of 125I-pro-MMP-2·TIMP-2. Both TIMP-2 and the pro-MMP-2 collagen-binding domain independently competed for endocytosis of 125I-pro-MMP-2·TIMP-2 complex. Surface plasmon resonance studies indicated that pro-MMP-2, TIMP-2, and pro-MMP-2·TIMP-2 directly interact with LRP in the absence of TSP. LRP-mediated endocytic clearance of 125I-pro-MMP-2 was inhibited by anti-TSP antibodies and accelerated upon complexing with TSP-1, but these treatments had no effect on 125I-pro-MMP-2·TIMP-2 uptake. This implies that mechanisms of clearance by LRP of pro-MMP-2 and pro-MMP-2·TIMP-2 complex are different. Interestingly, RAP did not inhibit binding of 125I-pro-MMP-2·TIMP-2 to the cell surface. We conclude that clearance of pro-MMP-2·TIMP-2 complex is a TSP-independent two-step process, involving (i) initial binding to the cell membrane in a RAP-insensitive manner and (ii) subsequent LRP-dependent (RAP-sensitive) internalization and degradation. The low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein (LRP) mediates the endocytic clearance of various proteinases and proteinase·inhibitor complexes, including thrombospondin (TSP)-dependent endocytosis of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2 (or gelatinase A), a key effector of extracellular matrix remodeling and cancer progression. However, the zymogen of MMP-2 (pro-MMP-2) mostly occurs in tissues as a complex with the tissue inhibitor of MMPs (TIMP-2). Here we show that clearance of the pro-MMP-2·TIMP-2 complex is also mediated by LRP, because addition of receptor-associated protein (RAP), a natural LRP ligand antagonist, inhibited endocytosis and lysosomal degradation of 125I-pro-MMP-2·TIMP-2. Both TIMP-2 and the pro-MMP-2 collagen-binding domain independently competed for endocytosis of 125I-pro-MMP-2·TIMP-2 complex. Surface plasmon resonance studies indicated that pro-MMP-2, TIMP-2, and pro-MMP-2·TIMP-2 directly interact with LRP in the absence of TSP. LRP-mediated endocytic clearance of 125I-pro-MMP-2 was inhibited by anti-TSP antibodies and accelerated upon complexing with TSP-1, but these treatments had no effect on 125I-pro-MMP-2·TIMP-2 uptake. This implies that mechanisms of clearance by LRP of pro-MMP-2 and pro-MMP-2·TIMP-2 complex are different. Interestingly, RAP did not inhibit binding of 125I-pro-MMP-2·TIMP-2 to the cell surface. We conclude that clearance of pro-MMP-2·TIMP-2 complex is a TSP-independent two-step process, involving (i) initial binding to the cell membrane in a RAP-insensitive manner and (ii) subsequent LRP-dependent (RAP-sensitive) internalization and degradation. Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) 1The abbreviations used are: MMP, matrix metalloproteinase; TIMP, tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases; TSP, thrombospondin; LRP, lipoprotein receptor-related protein; RAP, receptor-associated protein; CBD, collagen-binding domain; SPR, surface plasmon resonance; EGF, epidermal growth factor; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium; TBS, Tris-buffered saline; MT, membrane-type. 1The abbreviations used are: MMP, matrix metalloproteinase; TIMP, tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases; TSP, thrombospondin; LRP, lipoprotein receptor-related protein; RAP, receptor-associated protein; CBD, collagen-binding domain; SPR, surface plasmon resonance; EGF, epidermal growth factor; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium; TBS, Tris-buffered saline; MT, membrane-type. compose a family of zinc-dependent endopeptidases that mediate tissue remodeling both in physiological and pathological situations (1Visse R. Nagase H. Circ. Res. 2003; 92: 827-839Crossref PubMed Scopus (3614) Google Scholar). In particular, MMP-2 (or gelatinase A) has been originally associated with the metastatic potential of tumor cells (2Stetler-Stevenson W.G. Cancer Metastasis Rev. 1990; 9: 289-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar). After intradermal implantation of cancer cells, mice devoid of MMP-2 show markedly reduced angiogenesis, tumor growth, and metastasis (3Itoh T. Tanioka M. Yoshida H. Yoshioka T. Nishimoto H. Itohara S. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 1048-1051PubMed Google Scholar). Most MMPs are secreted as inactive proenzymes and are subsequently activated by other MMPs or by serine proteinases, either in the extracellular matrix or nearby the plasma membrane (4Nagase H. Biol. Chem. 1997; 378: 151-160PubMed Google Scholar). Membrane-type (MT)-MMPs are anchored to the cell membrane by a C-terminal transmembrane domain or by a glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchor (5Hernandez-Barrantes S. Bernardo M. Toth M. Fridman R. Semin. Cancer Biol. 2002; 12: 131-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). The catalytic activity of MMPs is specifically inhibited by tissue inhibitors of MMPs (TIMPs) (6Brew K. Dinakarpandian D. Nagase H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1477: 267-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (1583) Google Scholar). Gelatinases A (MMP-2) and B (MMP-9) mostly occur in biological tissues as latent enzymes complexed to their specific inhibitor, TIMP-2 and TIMP-1, respectively (7Goldberg G.I. Marmer B.L. Grant G.A. Eisen A.Z. Wilhelm S.M. He C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 8207-8211Crossref PubMed Scopus (544) Google Scholar, 8Wilhelm S.M. Collier I.E. Marmer B.L. Eisen A.Z. Grant G.A. Goldberg G.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 17213-17221Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Both gelatinases share peptide repeats homologous to fibronectin type II modules inserted in their catalytic domain (9Overall C.M. Mol. Biotechnol. 2002; 22: 51-86Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), whereby they interact equally well with thrombospondin (TSP)-1 or TSP-2 (10Bein K. Simons M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 32167-32173Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). Thrombospondins are multidomain macromolecules that function as regulators of cell behavior by interacting with specific cell surface receptors, cytokines, growth factors, and proteases (11Bornstein P. J. Clin. Invest. 2001; 107: 929-934Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar). Beside their ability to degrade extracellular matrix macromolecules, MMPs process or degrade numerous bioactive pericellular substrates, including other proteinases, proteinase inhibitors, chemotactic molecules, latent growth factors, growth factor-binding proteins, cell surface receptors, and cell-cell adhesion molecules (12Basbaum C.B. Werb Z. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 731-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). The control of pericellular MMP activities therefore requires tight regulation, via local activation or silencing. Activation of pro-MMP-2 involves ternary interactions. The C-terminal domain of pro-MMP-2 specifically interacts with the C-terminal domain of TIMP-2 to form a heterodimeric pro-MMP-2·TIMP-2 complex. Next, binding of the TIMP-2 moiety of this complex via its N-terminal part to the catalytic site of one MT1-MMP molecule localizes the pro-MMP-2 moiety to the cell surface (13Strongin A.Y. Collier I. Bannikov G. Marmer B.L. Grant G.A. Goldberg G.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5331-5338Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1435) Google Scholar), allowing its pericellular activation by associated or neighboring MT1-MMP unoccupied by TIMP-2 (14Itoh Y. Takamura A. Ito N. Maru Y. Sato H. Suenaga N. Aoki T. Seiki M. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 4782-4793Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar). Conversely, the membrane-associated glycoprotein, RECK, inhibits MMP-2, as well as MMP-9 and MT1-MMP catalytic activities (15Rhee J-S. Coussens L.M. Trends Cell Biol. 2002; 12: 209-211Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). In addition, endocytosis, a general clearance mechanism for extracellular material, also contributes to the elimination of MMP-2, -9, and -13 by a receptor-mediated process, which is not yet fully understood (16Yang Z. Strickland D.K. Bornstein P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 8403-8408Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar, 17Hahn-Dantona E. Ruiz J.F. Bornstein P. Strickland D.K. J. Biol.

The low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein (LRP), a member of the low density lipoprotein receptor superfamily, is a heterodimeric endocytic receptor comprising a large ligand-binding, integral membrane subunit (the 515-kDa heavy chain), and a non-covalently associated transmembrane partner (the 85-kDa light chain) (19Herz J. Strickland D.K. J. Clin. Invest. 2001; 108: 779-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (880) Google Scholar). LRP mediates the endocytic clearance of several classes of ligands, including urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA) complexed to plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (20Nykjaer A. Petersen C.M.

LRP·ligand complexes are first transported into endosomes where they dissociate in the acidic environment. Ligands are then delivered to lysosomes for degradation, whereas LRP is recycled to the cell surface for a new round of receptor-mediated endocytosis. A 39-kDa protein, originally identified by its co-purification with LRP (25Strickland D.K. Ashcom J.D. Williams S. Battey F. Behre E. McTigue K. Battey J.F. Argraves W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 13364-13369Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and thereby termed receptor-associated protein (RAP), interacts by its C-terminal heparin-binding sites with this receptor at a high affinity (26Warshawsky I.

Chem. 2001; 276: 29338-29346Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). RAP efficiently blocks the binding and uptake of all known ligands of LRP (28Bu G. Schwartz A.L. Trends Cell Biol. 1998; 8: 272-276Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) but also of other members of the low density lipoprotein-receptor superfamily, such as megalin. There is some evidence that TSP may promote LRP-mediated endocytosis of MMP-2 and its subsequent lysosomal degradation (16Yang Z. Strickland D.K. Bornstein P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 8403-8408Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). Interaction between MMP-2 and TSP was suggested by a yeast two-hybrid screening of TSP-1 and -2 partners (10Bein K. Simons M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 32167-32173Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar), but no direct evidence was provided that TSP could bind latent or active MMP-2 complexed with TIMP-2. In the present report, we investigated the possible interaction with LRP and fate of pro-MMP-2·TIMP-2 complex in HT1080 human fibrosarcoma cells as a model system, where this or related processes have been previously studied by other groups (29Maquoi E. Frankenne F. Baramova E. Munaut C. Sounni N.O. Remacle A. Noël A. Murphy G. Foidart J.M. J. Biol.

Cell Res. 2004; 293: 164-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). First, LRP involvement was tested by the effect of RAP on the accumulation of endogenous pro-MMP-2 and TIMP-2 in the culture medium, as well as on radioligand surface binding and receptor-mediated endocytosis. Second, the role of TSP in the endocytosis of pro-MMP-2·TIMP-2 was explored. Because MMP-2 equally binds to TSP-1 and -2, which are internalized and degraded through similar pathways (22Mikhailenko I. Kounnas M.Z. Strickland D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9543-9549Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 23Chen H. Strickland D.K. Mosher D.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15993-15999Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), we compared the effect of precomplexing with TSP-1, or of antibodies blocking its interaction with either MMP-2 or LRP, on the uptake and degradation of pro-MMP-2 and pro-MMP-2·TIMP-2 complex. Third, to analyze the role of each partner of the complex, we tested the ability of CBD 123, a recombinant protein comprising the entire MMP-2 collagen-binding domain (32Banyai L. Tordai H. Patthy L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12003-12008Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), and of TIMP-2 to compete for LRP-mediated endocytosis and degradation of the 125I-pro-MMP-2·TIMP-2 complex and their potential for cross-competition. Finally, all relevant interactions with LRP were measured by surface plasmon resonance (SPR). Materials—Cell culture medium, fetal calf serum, and other cell culture reagents were purchased from Invitrogen (Carlsbad, CA). Albumin from bovine serum albumin or human serum albumin, chloroquine, and cycloheximide were obtained from Sigma. Na125I and Iodogen® pre-coated tubes were from Amersham Biosciences and Pierce, respectively. The ECL immunoblotting detection kit was from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Proteins and Antibodies—Recombinant human pro-MMP-2 and TIMP-2 were expressed in HEK-293 cells using the mammalian expression vector pCEP4 (Invitrogen) (33Troeberg L. Tanaka M. Wait R. Shi Y.E. Brew K. Nagase H. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 15025-15035Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Pro-MMP-2 was purified using gelatin-Sepharose affinity chromatography and gel filtration with S-200 (Amersham Biosciences) as described previously (34Itoh Y. Binner S. Nagase H. Biochem. J. 1995; 308: 645-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). TIMP-2 was purified using Green A Dyematrex affinity chromatography (Millipore, Billerica, MA) and gel filtration with S-200 (33Troeberg L. Tanaka M. Wait R. Shi Y.E. Brew K. Nagase H. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 15025-15035Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Pro-MMP-2·TIMP-2 complex was purified from conditioned medium of human uterine cervical fibroblasts, as described (34Itoh Y. Binner S. Nagase H. Biochem. J. 1995; 308: 645-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). CBD 123 protein, the recombinant collagen-binding domain (CBD) comprising the three fibronectin type II-like modules of human MMP-2, was expressed in Escherichia coli and purified by gelatin-Sepharose 4B chromatography as reported previously (32Banyai L. Tordai H. Patthy L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12003-12008Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 35Berton A. Rigot V. Huet E. Decarme M. Eeckhout Y. Patthy L. Godeau G.

J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 14011-14017Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was kindly provided by Dr. S. K. Moestrup (University of Aarhus, Aarhus, Denmark). Recombinant RAP was prepared as described (37Nielsen M.S. Nykjaer A. Warshawsky I. Schwartz A.L. Gliemann J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23713-23719Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Epidermal growth factor (EGF) was purchased from R&D Systems Europe (Lille, France). TSP-1 from human platelets and anti-TIMP-2 mouse monoclonal antibody (clone T2–101) were from Calbiochem. Anti-LRP mouse monoclonal antibody 8G1 was a generous gift from Prof. D. K. Strickland (American Red Cross, Rockville, MD). Four anti-TSP mouse monoclonal antibodies (Ab-1, -3, -9, and -11) were purchased from NeoMarkers (Lab Vision Co., Fremont, CA). Ab-1 recognizes an epitope localized in the properdin-like type 1 repeats of TSP-1, a domain that interacts with both MMP-2 and MMP-9 (10Bein K. Simons M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 32167-32173Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). In contrast, Ab-9 is directed against an epitope present in the N-terminal, heparin-binding domain, which mediates interaction with LRP. As a control, Ab-3 recognizes an epitope localized in the C-terminal part of TSP-1 and does not prevent its interaction with LRP (38Mikhailenko I. Krylov D. McTigue Argraves K. Roberts D.D. Liau G. Strickland D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6784-6791Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Ab-11 is a mixture of monoclonal antibodies designed for sensitive detection by Western blotting. Cell Culture and RAP Treatment—Human fibrosarcoma HT1080 cells were purchased from American Type Culture Collection and grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum, 100 IU/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, 2 mm l-glutamine, and 25 mm HEPES buffer at 37 °C in a humid atmosphere (5% CO2 and 95% air). In the experiments involving RAP treatment, subconfluent cells were cultured in the absence or presence of 500 nm recombinant RAP for 24 h in serum-free medium. These 24-h-conditioned media were then analyzed by gelatin zymography to detect MMP-2 and by Western blotting to detect TIMP-2 and TSP-1. Protein Assay—Protein content was measured using the bicinchoninic acid protein microassay (39Smith P.K. Krohn R.I. Hermanson G.T. Mallia A.K. Gartner F.H. Provenzano M.D. Fujimoto E.K. Goeke N.M. Olson B.J. Klenk D.C. Anal. Biochem. 1985; 150: 76-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (18510) Google Scholar), with bovine serum albumin as a standard. Gelatin Zymography—Sample volumes, normalized to cell protein content, were diluted in non-reducing 2% (w/v) SDS sample buffer and electrophoresed on 10% polyacrylamide SDS gels containing 0.1% (w/v) gelatin. After electrophoresis, gels were washed at room temperature for 2 × 30 min in 2.5% (v/v) Triton X-100 to remove SDS and incubated at 37 °C for 16 h in 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5, containing 200 mm NaCl and 5 mm CaCl2. After incubation, gels were stained for 30 min with 0.1% (w/v) G-250 Coomassie Blue in 45% (v/v) methanol, 10% (v/v) acetic acid glacial, and destained in the same solution without dye. Western Blotting—Equal amounts of proteins of conditioned media (20 μg/lane) were resolved by SDS-PAGE using 5% (to detect TSP-1) or 15% (to detect TIMP-2) polyacrylamide gels and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane (Hybond™-C extra, Amersham Biosciences). Blots were blocked with 5% (w/v) nonfat dried milk in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.5 m NaCl (TBS) containing 0.05% (v/v) Tween 20 (TBS-T) at room temperature for 90 min. The filters were then incubated with 0.5 μg/ml primary anti-TIMP-2 or anti-TSP-1 Ab-11 monoclonal antibodies in TBS-T supplemented with 0.5% nonfat dried milk at 4 °C for 16 h, followed by three washes with TBS-T. Blots were finally incubated at room temperature for 1 h with peroxidase-conjugated sheep anti-mouse IgG (Amersham Biosciences) diluted 1/10,000 in TBS-T supplemented with 0.5% nonfat milk and washed once in TBS-T and twice in TBS. Immunoreactive bands were visualized using chemiluminescence. Radioiodination of Proteins—Proteins were labeled with 125I using Iodogen® according to manufacturer's recommendations. Specific activities ranged from 5 to 20 μCi/μg. Trichloroacetic acid-precipitable radioactivity of radioligands used was always >97%. Radioligand Binding onto Cultured Cells—HT1080 cells (3 × 105) were plated onto 35-mm dishes and cultured overnight, then washed twice with assay medium (DMEM containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin) and adapted to this medium at 4 °C for 1 h. Cells were then incubated with 10 nm125I-pro-MMP-2·TIMP-2 complex in assay medium at 4 °C for 2 h, in the absence or presence of 500 nm RAP. After careful rinsing (nine times with cold phosphate-buffered saline, on ice), cells were surface-digested with 0.1% (w/v) Pronase in DMEM at 4 °C to degrade surface-bound ligands and cause cell detachment. After cell collection by centrifugation, radioactivity released in supernatant (Pronase-sensitive), measured by γ counting, was defined as surface-bound ligand. Binding of 125I-pro-MMP-2·TIMP-2 complex to plastic dishes without cells did not exceed 8% of total bound radioactivity. Endocytosis and Degradation Assays—Alternatively, cells adapted to 4 °C were incubated with 10 nm125I-pro-MMP-2·TIMP-2 complex in assay medium at 4 °C for 2 h, in the absence or presence of 1 μm unlabeled CBD 123, 1 μm unlabeled TIMP-2, or 500 nm RAP. In other experiments, cells were incubated with assay medium containing 10 nm125I-CBD 123, in the absence or presence of 1 μm unlabeled TIMP-2 or 500 nm RAP, or containing 10 nm125I-TIMP-2, in the absence or presence of 1 μm unlabeled CBD 123 or 500 nm RAP. After binding, cells were carefully rinsed nine times with cold phosphate-buffered saline and further cultured in assay medium pre-warmed at 37 °C for the indicated times. To distinguish surface-binding from intracellular accumulation, cells were washed twice with cold phosphate-buffered saline, and surface-digested with Pronase as above. Radioactivity associated with pelleted cells (Pronase-resistant) was defined as internalized ligand. After precipitation of the medium by 10% (w/v) trichloroacetic acid and centrifugation, radioactivity in the supernatant was taken to indicate the amount of degraded 125I-ligand. To inhibit lysosomal activity, 100 μm chloroquine was added to some cultures 2 h before radioligand binding. Internalization and degradation were then studied as above after 2 h at 37 °C, in the continued presence of chloroquine. Effect of TSP-1 on the Binding and Degradation of 125I-Pro-MMP-2·TIMP-2 Complex—After two washes in serum-free DMEM, cells were cultured at 37 °C for 18 h in fresh serum-free medium supplemented with 10 μg/ml of Ab-3, Ab-9, or preimmune mouse IgG1 as control. After cooling dishes on melting ice for 1 h, cells were incubated with 10 nm125I-pro-MMP-2·TIMP-2 complex or 125I-pro-MMP-2 at 4 °C for 2 h, washed extensively, and incubated again at 37 °C to follow internalization and degradation as above. Alternatively, serum-free DMEM was supplemented with 20 μg/ml cycloheximide for 30 min to inhibit protein synthesis. TSP-1·Ab-1 complex was prepared extemporaneously by mixing TSP-1 with anti-TSP Ab-1 monoclonal antibody (10 nm each) at 37 °C for 30 min. 10 nm TSP-1 or TSP-1·Ab-1 complex was then mixed with 10 nm125I-pro-MMP-2·TIMP-2 at 37 °C for 30 min (10Bein K. Simons M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 32167-32173Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). Cycloheximide-treated cells were rinsed twice, then incubated with 10 nm125I-pro-MMP-2, 125I-pro-MMP-2·TIMP-2, or 125I-pro-MMP-2·TIMP-2:TSP-1 complex, or 125I-pro-MMP-2·TIMP-2/TSP-1·Ab-1 mixtures, in the absence or presence of 500 nm RAP and in the continued presence of cycloheximide. Internalization and degradation assays were performed as described above. Surface Plasmon Resonance Analysis—Interaction of various ligands with LRP was tested using a BIAcore X system (BIAcore AB, Uppsala, Sweden). LRP was immobilized on a CM5 sensor chip by amine coupling at a density of 26 fmol/mm2. Routinely, a control channel was activated and blocked using the amine-coupling reagents in the absence of protein. Binding to coated channels was corrected for binding to non-coated channels (<5% of binding to coated channels). The instrument was maintained at 25 °C. SPR analysis was performed in 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm CaCl2, 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5, at a flow rate of 5 μl/min. After each cycle, sensor chips were regenerated by injecting 30 μl of 10 mm glycine-HCl buffer, pH 2.3. This was sufficient to return to baseline level after each test. Concentrations of the different ligands, which were injected over the immobilized LRP, varied from nanomolar (pro-MMP-2·TIMP-2 complex, pro-MMP-2, and TIMP-2) to micromolar (CBD 123 peptide) range. Each determination was performed in triplicate at different concentrations (n = 6). As a positive control, TSP-1 was injected at 15, 30, and 60 nm; as a negative control, EGF, which does not bind to LRP (40Loukinova E. Ranganathan S. Kuznetsov S. Gorlatova N. Migliorini M.M.

BIAevaluation software was used to analyze the resulting sensorgrams, so as to determine the association (ka) and dissociation (kd) rate constants by non-linear global fitting data corrected for bulk refractive index changes, and to derive the equilibrium constant of dissociation (KD). The best fitting was obtained using a one-site model. Statistical Analyses—All values are expressed as means of triplicates ± S.D. unless otherwise specified. Statistical significance was tested using the Student's t test. Differences with untreated controls were interpreted as significant at p < 0.01 (*) and p < 0.001 (**). The LRP Competitor, RAP, Causes Accumulation of Pro-MMP-2, TIMP-2, and TSP-1 in Medium Conditioned by HT1080 Cells—Using HT1080 human fibrosarcoma cells that express a functionally active LRP at their surface (21Czekay R-P. Kuemmel T.A. Orlando R.A. Farquhar M.G. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 1467-1479Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar), we found that treatment of cultures with RAP, a classic competitor of LRP·ligand interaction (41Herz J. Goldstein J.L. Strickland D.K. Ho Y.K. Brown M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 21232-21238Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), caused a 3- to 4-fold increase of the accumulation of pro-MMP-2, TIMP-2, and TSP-1 in conditioned media (Fig. 1). These results confirm that LRP mediates the cellular uptake of pro-MMP-2 (16Yang Z. Strickland D.K. Bornstein P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 8403-8408Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar) and TSP-1 (22Mikhailenko I. Kounnas M.Z. Strickland D.K. J. Biol.

Direct Interaction of LRP with Pro-MMP-2, TIMP-2, and Pro-MMP-2·TIMP-2 Complex—Because pro-MMP-2 is naturally complexed with TIMP-2 (7Goldberg G.I. Marmer B.L. Grant G.A. Eisen A.Z. Wilhelm S.M. He C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 8207-8211Crossref PubMed Scopus (544) Google Scholar), we next investigated whether not only pro-MMP-2 or TIMP-2, but also pro-MMP-2·TIMP-2 complex can physically interact with LRP, using purified LRP immobilized on a BIAcore sensor chip. As shown in Table I, a direct interaction was demonstrated for each candidate ligand. Affinity was in the submicromolar range of affinity, and was 3- to 10-fold higher for the complex as compared with its individual partners. TSP-1 also showed a direct interaction with LRP, with a nanomolar range of affinity, in good agreement with a previous report based on radioligand competition assay in LRP-coated multiwells (22Mikhailenko I. Kounnas M.Z. Strickland D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9543-9549Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Because the affinity for the pro-MMP-2·TIMP-2 complex was almost two orders of magnitude lower than for TSP-1, we used a protein that is not expected to interact at all with LRP to obtain a limit of significance. For this purpose, we used EGF, which has been previously shown by similar SPR studies not to bind to immobilized LRP (40Loukinova E. Ranganathan S. Kuznetsov S. Gorlatova N. Migliorini M.M.

https://openalex.org/W2075922340,"Constitutive albumin uptake by the proximal tubule is achieved by a receptor-mediated process in which the Cl– channel, ClC-5, plays an obligate role. Here we investigated the functional interaction between ClC-5 and ubiquitin ligases Nedd4 and Nedd4-2 and their role in albumin uptake in opossum kidney proximal tubule (OK) cells. In vivo immunoprecipitation using an anti-HECT antibody demonstrated that ClC-5 bound to ubiquitin ligases, whereas glutathione S-transferase pull-downs confirmed that the C terminus of ClC-5 bound both Nedd4 and Nedd4-2. Nedd4-2 alone was able to alter ClC-5 currents in Xenopus oocytes by decreasing cell surface expression of ClC-5. In OK cells, a physiological concentration of albumin (10 μg/ml) rapidly increased cell surface expression of ClC-5, which was also accompanied by the ubiquitination of ClC-5. Albumin uptake was reduced by inhibiting either the lysosome or proteasome. Total levels of Nedd4-2 and proteasome activity also increased rapidly in response to albumin. Overexpression of ligase defective Nedd4-2 or knockdown of endogenous Nedd4-2 with small interfering RNA resulted in significant decreases in albumin uptake. In contrast, pathophysiological concentrations of albumin (100 and 1000 μg/ml) reduced the levels of ClC-5 and Nedd4-2 and the activity of the proteasome to the levels seen in the absence of albumin. These data demonstrate that normal constitutive uptake of albumin by the proximal tubule requires Nedd4-2, which may act via ubiquitination to shunt ClC-5 into the endocytic pathway."
https://openalex.org/W2101196277,"Demyelination is a key component in the pathogenesis of many neurological disorders. Transplantation of myelinating cells may offer a therapeutic approach to restore neurological function in these diseases. Recent findings suggest that pluripotent embryonic stem (ES) cells can serve as an unlimited donor source for neural transplantation. The clinical application of ES cells for myelin repair will depend critically on the ability to enrich oligodendroglial progenitors in high purity. Combining controlled differentiation in the presence of growth factors and genetic lineage selection, we devised a cell culture protocol yielding highly purified oligodendrocyte progenitors. Murine ES cell clones stably transfected with a construct encoding the beta-galactosidase-neomycine phosphotransferase fusion protein (beta(geo)) under control of the 2'3'-cyclic nucleotide 3'-phosphodiesterase (CNP) promoter were differentiated into bipotential glial precursors. Subsequent induction of a CNP-positive stage and selection in neomycine resulted in a homogenous cell population with a pre-oligodendrocyte phenotype. The selected cells continued to proliferate in the presence of FGF-2 and PDGF and, upon growth factor withdrawal, differentiated into mature galactocerebroside (GalC)-positive oligodendrocytes. Transplantation studies in myelin-deficient (md) rats indicate that ES cell-derived oligodendrocyte progenitors generated with this method may serve as an attractive donor source for myelin repair."
https://openalex.org/W2017608263,"To find proteins with nucleotidase activity in Escherichia coli, purified unknown proteins were screened for the presence of phosphatase activity using the general phosphatase substrate p-nitrophenyl phosphate. Proteins exhibiting catalytic activity were then assayed for nucleotidase activity against various nucleotides. These screens identified the presence of nucleotidase activity in three uncharacterized E. coli proteins, SurE, YfbR, and YjjG, that belong to different enzyme superfamilies: SurE-like family, HD domain family (YfbR), and haloacid dehalogenase (HAD)-like superfamily (YjjG). The phosphatase activity of these proteins had a neutral pH optimum (pH 7.0–8.0) and was strictly dependent on the presence of divalent metal cations (SurE: Mn2+ > Co2+ > Ni2+ > Mg2+; YfbR: Co2+ > Mn2+ > Cu2+; YjjG: Mg2+ > Mn2+ > Co2+). Further biochemical characterization of SurE revealed that it has a broad substrate specificity and can dephosphorylate various ribo- and deoxyribonucleoside 5′-monophosphates and ribonucleoside 3′-monophosphates with highest affinity to 3′-AMP. SurE also hydrolyzed polyphosphate (exopolyphosphatase activity) with the preference for short-chain-length substrates (P20–25). YfbR was strictly specific to deoxyribonucleoside 5′-monophosphates, whereas YjjG showed narrow specificity to 5′-dTMP, 5′-dUMP, and 5′-UMP. The three enzymes also exhibited different sensitivities to inhibition by various nucleoside di- and triphosphates: YfbR was equally sensitive to both di- and triphosphates, SurE was inhibited only by triphosphates, and YjjG was insensitive to these effectors. The differences in their sensitivities to nucleotides and their varied substrate specificities suggest that these enzymes play unique functions in the intracellular nucleotide metabolism in E. coli.

DNA and RNA synthesis requires a continuous and balanced supply of the four deoxyribonucleotides and four ribonucleotides. A network of biosynthetic and catabolic enzymes regulates the size of each pool with the enzymes ribonucleotide reductase, nucleoside kinases, and nucleotidases playing the main roles (1Reichard P. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1988; 57: 349-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (637) Google Scholar). By opposing the phosphorylation of nucleosides by kinases, intracellular 5′-nucleotidases participate in substrate cycles that regulate the cellular levels of ribo- and deoxyribonucleoside monophosphates and thereby all ribo- and deoxyribonucleotide pools (1Reichard P. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1988; 57: 349-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (637) Google Scholar, 2Bianchi V. Spychala J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 46195-46198Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Nucleoside monophosphate phosphohydrolases or nucleotidases (EC 3.1.3.5 and EC 3.1.3.6) are phosphatases that specifically dephosphorylate nucleoside monophosphates to nucleosides and inorganic phosphate. Seven mammalian 5′-nucleotidases have been identified through cloning and biochemical characterization. These enzymes differ in tissue specificity, subcellular localization, primary structure, and substrate specificity (2Bianchi V. Spychala J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 46195-46198Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). All act on nucleoside monophosphates producing free nucleosides and Pi. Each natural nucleotide can be the substrate for several nucleotidases, because they have overlapping specificities. The ubiquitous ecto-5′-nucleotidase, eN, 1The abbreviations used are: eN, ecto-5′-nucleotidase; cN, cytosolic nucleotidase; HAD, haloacid dehalogenase; pNPP, p-nitrophenyl phosphate; MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid; CHES, 2-(cyclohexylamino)ethanesulfonic acid. is anchored to the surface of the plasma membrane, and AMP is considered to be its major physiological substrate (3Zimmermann H. Biochem. J. 1992; 285: 345-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (763) Google Scholar). Five other nucleotidases, including dNT-1, occur in the cytosol and one (dNT-2) occurs in mitochondria. dNT-1 and dNT-2 show a preference for the dephosphorylation of dUMP and dTMP (4Rampazzo C. Johansson M. Gallinaro L. Ferraro P. Hellman U. Karlsson A. Reichard P. Bianchi V. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5409-5415Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The “high Km-nucleotidase” cN-II prefers GMP and IMP (5Spychala J. Madrid-Marina V. Fox I.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 18759-18765Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the cytosolic nucleotidases cN-IA and cN-IB have a preference for dephosphorylation of AMP (6Hunsucker S.A. Spychala J. Mitchell B.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 10498-10504Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 7Sala-Newby G.B. Newby A.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1521: 12-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), and PN-1 (or cN-III) is most active with CMP and UMP (8Rees D.C. Duley J.A. Marinaki A.M. Br. J. Haematol. 2003; 120: 375-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). For bovine cN-II, the formation of a covalent phosphoenzyme intermediate has been demonstrated, and the phosphate group is localized to the N-terminal motif DXDX(T/V) (9Allegrini S. Scaloni A.

This short motif can also be found in other 5′-nucleotidases and is related to a similar motif in the haloacid dehalogenase (HAD)-like superfamily of enzymes (10Koonin E.V. Tatusov R.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 244: 125-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). Recently, the structure of human dNT-2 (a mitochondrial deoxyribonucleotidase) was solved and revealed a structural relationship to the HAD superfamily, members of which use an aspartyl nucleophile as their common catalytic strategy (11Rinaldo-Matthis A. Rampazzo C. Reichard P. Bianchi V. Nordlund P. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2002; 9: 779-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Based on these structures, the mononuclear metal center (Mg2+) and the N-terminal DXDX(T/V) motif are proposed to be the main players in the catalytic mechanism. In contrast to the well characterized mammalian nucleotidases, the field of prokaryotic nucleotidases remains unexplored. Previous studies demonstrated the presence of 5′-nucleotidase activity in crude extracts (probably in the periplasmic fraction) from Proteus vulgaris, Haemophilus influenzae, and Staphylococcus aureus (12Kohn J. Reis J.L. J. Bacteriol. 1963; 86: 713-716Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The membrane-bound nucleotidase from Bacillus cereus was purified and shown to be active toward ribo- and deoxyribonucleoside 5′- and 3′-monophosphates (13Schrader W.P. Anderson J.S. J. Bacteriol. 1978; 133: 576-583Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The soluble periplasmic 5′-nucleotidase UshA from E. coli was purified and shown to be able to hydrolyze all nucleoside 5′-mono-, di-, and triphosphates, as well as UDP-glucose (14Neu H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1967; 242: 3896-3904Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The crystal structure of this protein revealed the presence of a dimetal center and a catalytic dyad Asp-His in the active site indicating that its catalytic mechanism is different from that of the human 5′-nucleotidase dNT-2 (15Knöfel T. Sträter N. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 448-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). The major physiological role of the E. coli UshA is the degradation of exogenous UDP-glucose and 5′-nucleotides to nucleosides, glucose 1-phosphate, and phosphate for utilization by the cell (16Glaser L. Melo A. Paul R. J. Biol. Chem. 1967; 242: 1944-1954Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, in the KEGG PATHWAY data base of metabolic pathways (www.genome.ad.jp/kegg/pathway.html), this periplasmic protein UshA is mentioned as a nucleotidase responsible for the intracellular conversion of nucleoside 5′-monophosphates to corresponding nucleosides in E. coli. To identify intracellular nucleotidases in E. coli, we screened purified unknown proteins for phosphatase activity using a general phosphatase substrate, p-nitrophenyl phosphate (pNPP). Proteins that showed phosphatase activity against pNPP were further screened with a set of natural phosphatase substrates (70 phosphorylated compounds), including various nucleotides. E. coli SurE (253 amino acids), YfbR (199 amino acids), and YjjG (225 amino acids) demonstrated phosphohydrolase activities against general substrate pNPP and nucleotides. These uncharacterized proteins show no sequence similarity to each other (15.5–18.3% identity) and belong to different phosphohydrolase families: SurE-like, HD domain (YfbR), and haloacid dehalogenase (HAD)-like hydrolases (YjjG). Biochemical characterization of these proteins demonstrated that they have different substrate specificities and are likely to be involved in different reactions of intracellular nucleotide metabolism. Gene Cloning and Protein Purification—Purified uncharacterized E. coli proteins used for screening were provided by the Ontario Centre for Structural Proteomics (www.uhnres.utoronto.ca/proteomics/). The genes encoding these proteins were amplified by PCR from E. coli DH5α genomic DNA and cloned as previously described (17Zhang R-G. Skarina T. Katz J.E. Beasley S. Khachatryan A. Vyas S. Arrowsmith C.H. Clarke S. Edwards A. Joachimiak A. Savchenko A. Structure. 2001; 9: 1095-1106Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) into the NdeI and BamHI sites of a modified form of pET15b (Novagen) in which a tobacco etch virus protease cleavage site replaced the thrombin cleavage site and a double stop codon was introduced downstream from the BamHI site. The E. coli YfbR was cloned from the E. coli K12 W3110 genomic DNA into the archive vector pCA24N (Genobase data base, ecoli.aistnara.ac.jp). To prepare protein samples for screening, recombinant proteins containing an N-terminal His6 fusion tag were expressed in 1-liter E. coli BL21(DE3) cultures and affinity-purified on nickel-nitrilo-triacetic acid resin (Qiagen) as previously described (17Zhang R-G. Skarina T. Katz J.E. Beasley S. Khachatryan A. Vyas S. Arrowsmith C.H. Clarke S. Edwards A. Joachimiak A. Savchenko A. Structure. 2001; 9: 1095-1106Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Briefly, cell lysates were loaded onto small (1.5 × 4 cm) nickel columns equilibrated with loading buffer (50 mm HEPES-K, pH 7.5; 0.5 m NaCl; 5 mm imidazole), washed with 10 volumes of washing buffer (loading buffer containing 30 mm imidazole), and eluted with 250 mm imidazole in loading buffer. For biochemical characterization, the proteins were overexpressed in 4-liter cultures of the E. coli BL21(DE3) and purified to over 95% of homogeneity using a combination of affinity chromatography on nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid resin (Qiagen) and anion-exchange chromatography on Q-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences). General Phosphatase Screens—Purified E. coli proteins were screened for phosphatase activity using general phosphatase substrate p-nitrophenyl phosphate (pNPP) in 96-well microplates. The reaction mixture (0.2 ml) contained 50 mm HEPES-K buffer (pH 7.5), 5 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm MnCl2, 0.5 mm NiCl2, 40 mm pNPP, 0.1–1.0 μg of purified protein. After addition of protein samples, the plates were incubated for 1–3 h at 37 °C before taking the reading at 410 nm. Positive controls with 1 μg of calf intestinal phosphatase from Sigma were included in all tests. Natural Phosphatase Screens—To screen purified proteins for phosphatase activity against natural substrates, 70 phosphorylated compounds from Sigma (various nucleotides and phosphorylated sugars, amino acids, and organic acids) were used as individual substrates (one compound/well) or as a mix of several related compounds (nucleoside 5′-mono-, di-, or triphosphates, nucleoside 3′-monophosphates). Screening was performed in 96-well microplates using 160-μl reaction mixtures containing 50 mm HEPES-K (pH 7.5), 0.1 mm substrate, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm MnCl2, 0.5 mm NiCl2, and 2–5 μg of protein. After 30–60 min of incubation at 37 °C, the reaction was terminated by the addition of 40 μl of Malachite Green reagent (18Baykov A.A. Evtushenko O.A. Avaeva S.M. Anal. Biochem. 1988; 171: 266-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (694) Google Scholar), and after 5 min the production of Pi was measured at 630 nm. Enzymatic Assays—Phosphatase activity against pNPP was measured in a reaction mixture (1 ml) containing 50 mm HEPES-K buffer (pH 7.0, for SurE; pH 8.0, for YfbR; and pH 7.5, for YjjG), 0.1–10 mm metal (as indicated in the figure legends), 4–8 mm pNPP, and 1–8 μgof protein. After 10–20 min of incubation at 37 °C, the reaction was stopped by the addition of 0.2 ml of 6 n NaOH, and the concentration of the p-nitrophenol product was determined from the absorbance at 410 nm. The pH dependence of phosphatase activity toward pNPP (4 mm)or natural substrates (0.1 mm) was determined in the presence of optimal metal (5 mm Mg2+ or 0.5 mm of other metals) and 1–8 μg of purified protein. Assays were performed in MES-K buffer between pH 5.5 and 6.5, in HEPES-K buffer between pH 7.0 and 8.0, in CHES-K buffer between pH 8.5 and 10.0, in CAPS-K buffer between pH 10.0 and 11.0. The metal dependence (metal profiles) of the phosphatase activity with pNPP or natural substrates was determined at optimal pH using various metals (5 mm Mg2+ or 0.5 mm of other metals), substrate (4 mm pNPP or 0.1 mm of natural substrate), and 1 μg of protein. Phosphatase (nucleotidase) activity toward selected natural substrates (substrate profiles) was assayed in 0.8-ml reaction mixtures containing 50 mm HEPES-K buffer (pH 7.0, for SurE; pH 8.0, for YfbR; pH 7.5, for YjjG), 0.1–0.5 mm substrate, 0.1–0.5 mm of metal (as indicated), 1–8 μg of protein. After 20–30 min incubation at 37 °C, the reaction was terminated by the addition of 0.2 ml of Malachite Green reagent (18Baykov A.A. Evtushenko O.A. Avaeva S.M. Anal. Biochem. 1988; 171: 266-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (694) Google Scholar), and the production of Pi was measured at 630 nm. One unit of activity is defined as 1 μmol of Pi/min. For determination of the Km and Vmax, the phosphatase assays contained substrates at concentrations of 0.005–2.0 mm. Kinetic parameters were determined by non-linear curve fitting from the Lineweaver-Burk plot using GraphPad Prism software (version 4.00 for Windows, GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA, www.graphpad.com). Phosphotransferase activity of purified proteins was assayed qualitatively by TLC analysis of reaction products using cellulose plates in solvent A (saturated ammonium sulfate/3 m sodium acetate/isopropyl alcohol; 80:6:2) (19Genschik P. Billy E. Swaniewicz M. Filipowicz W. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2955-2967Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The reaction mixtures (20-μl final volume) were the same as for nucleotidase assays (described above), except that higher substrate (donors) concentrations (10 mm) were used and nucleoside acceptors (guanosine, cytidine, uridine, and thymidine; 10 mm final concentration) were added. The reaction products and nucleoside/nucleotide standards were visualized under UV light. Preparation of Polyphosphate Substrates—Polyphosphate mix (polyP-type 75, polyP-type 35, and polyP-type 15, all from Sigma) was fractionated on a HiTrap Q column (XL, 1 ml, Amersham Biosciences) using stepwise elution by the buffer (25 mm HEPES-K, pH 7.6) containing increasing concentrations of NaCl (0.05–1.0 m). The Pi concentration in fractions was determined after acid hydrolysis (1 m HCl, 7 min in boiling water bath) by the method of Chen (20Chen P.S. Toribara T. Warner H. Anal. Biochem. 1956; 28: 1756-1758Google Scholar). The chain length of polyP substrates was assessed using polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in 20% polyacrylamide gel with 7 m urea. polyP standards were generated by a partial acid hydrolysis (0.1 m HCl, 75 °C with different time intervals) of polyP750, and the chain length was determined by counting the bands after staining the gel with 0.05% toluidine blue. Native and Subunit Molecular Mass—Native molecular mass of purified proteins was determined by analytical gel-filtration using TSK-GEL G2000SWXL column (7.8 mm × 30 cm; Tosoh Bioscience, Montgomeryville, PA) operated on a Varian ProStar 230 HPLC system. The eluant was 50 mm HEPES-K (pH 7.5), containing 0.2 m NaCl, and the flow rate was 1 ml/min. Molecular mass markers used were from Amersham Biosciences: albumin (67 kDa), ovalbumin (43 kDa), chymotrypsinogen (25 kDa), and ribonuclease A (13.7 kDa). Subunit size and protein purity were determined by SDS-PAGE (10% total acrylamide) by the method of Laemmli and Favre (21Laemmli U.K. Favre M. J. Mol. Biol. 1973; 80: 575-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (3025) Google Scholar) with reference proteins from Amersham Biosciences (low molecular mass standards: phosphorylase b, 97 kDa; albumin, 66 kDa; ovalbumin, 45 kDa; carbonic anhydrase, 30 kDa; trypsin inhibitor, 20.1 kDa; and lactalbumin, 14.4 kDa). Protein concentrations were determined by the Bradford method (22Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217544) Google Scholar) with bovine serum albumin as standard. Screening of Purified Proteins for Phosphatase Activity— Over 300 purified unknown proteins from E. coli were screened for phosphatase activity against general phosphatase substrate p-nitrophenyl phosphate (pNPP). These screens identified the presence of phosphatase activity in several E. coli proteins, including SurE (Fig. 1A), YfbR, and YjjG (data not shown). Secondary catalytic screens with natural phosphatase substrates (70 compounds) and three metals (Mg2+, Mn2+, and Ni2+) revealed high phosphatase activity of these three proteins against a range of nucleoside 5′- or 3′-monophosphates (Fig. 1B; results are shown for SurE) indicating that the E. coli proteins SurE, YfbR, and YjjG are nucleotidases. These proteins were purified in large scale and further characterized. Gel-filtration experiments demonstrated that, in solution, all three proteins exist mostly in an oligomeric state. YjjG showed the presence of dimers (main fraction, molecular mass = 52.8 ± 2.19 kDa), monomers (molecular mass = 35.7 ± 0.77 kDa), and possibly tetramers (molecular mass > 100 kDa). The native molecular mass of the main fractions of YfbR and SurE was higher than 100 kDa suggesting at least tetrameric organization of these proteins. Gel-filtration analysis of these proteins also revealed the presence of the SurE monomers (molecular mass = 41.6 ± 0.42 kDa) and the YfbR trimers (molecular mass = 71.3 ± 5.26 kDa). E. coli SurE—The SurE family is an evolutionarily conserved group of proteins with homologues (or domains) found in eubacteria, archaea, and eukaryotes. The E. coli SurE was annotated as an acid phosphatase on the basis that its Yarrowia lipolytica homologue (PHO2; 21.5% sequence identity to the E. coli SurE) complemented mutations in two of the major acid phosphatases of Saccharomyces cerevisiae (23Treton B.Y. Le Dall M.T. Gallardin C.M. Curr. Genet. 1992; 22: 345-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). However, in our work purified E. coli SurE hydrolyzed pNPP with highest activity at neutral pH (pH 7.0; data not shown). E. coli SurE also showed different metal requirement with highest activity and affinity to Mn2+ followed by Co2+ > Ni2+ > Mg2+ (Fig. 2). With natural phosphatase substrates, the E. coli SurE showed significant activity toward nucleoside 5′-or3′-monophosphates (Fig. 3A). The protein hydrolyzed both purine and pyrimidine ribo- and deoxyribonucleotides effectively and had a neutral pH optimum (pH 7.0–7.2) (Fig. 3B). With all substrates, the protein showed saturation kinetics with high affinity to 3′-AMP, 5′-GMP, 5′-dGMP, 5′-AMP, and 3′-CMP (Table I). The observed Km values (0.10–0.37 mm) are in the range typical of “high Km” soluble 5′-nucleotidases from mammals (5Spychala J. Madrid-Marina V. Fox I.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 18759-18765Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As with pNPP, hydrolysis of natural substrates was greatly stimulated by a divalent metal cation with the same four metals showing similar efficiency (Fig. 2). With natural substrates, the protein had even higher affinity for metals with apparent KD at least 2-fold lower than in the presence of pNPP (Table II).Fig. 3Hydrolysis of natural phosphatase substrates by the E. coli SurE.

With this substrate, the protein showed exopolyphosphatase activity (Pi release) that was also dependent on the divalent metal cation. However, the protein showed highest activity in the presence of Mg2+ followed by Co2+ and Zn2+ (Fig. 4A) suggesting some difference between the nucleotidase and polyphosphatase active sites. With polyphosphate, the E. coli SurE also showed saturation kinetics but with sigmoidal saturation curve (Fig. 4B), instead of classic hyperbolic curve, with a Hill coefficient nH of 1.86 ± 0.41 indicating positive cooperativity in polyphosphate binding. The kinetic parameters of the E. coli SurE with polyP12–13 as a substrate are presented in Table I. The affinity of the E. coli SurE to polyP12–13 was slightly lower than that (Km = 3.9 μm) of the yeast exopolyphosphatase (24Akiyama M. Crooke E. Kornberg A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 633-639Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Two other E. coli proteins with exopolyphosphatase activity have been already purified and characterized, the principal exopolyphosphatase PPX and the second exopolyphosphatase GPP, a guanosine pentaphosphate phosphohydrolase, which also possesses an exopolyphosphatase activity (25Keasling J.D. Bertsch L. Kornberg A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 7029-7033Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 26Wurst H. Kornberg A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10996-11001Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Both proteins showed high activity and affinity to the long-chain polyphosphate substrate polyP500. In contrast to these proteins, the E. coli SurE exhibited a clear preference for the short chain-length substrates with highest activity toward the PolyP20–25 substrate (Fig. 4C). E. coli YfbR—The E. coli YfbR is a hypothetical protein with homologues in bacteria, archaea, eukaryotes, and humans. In general phosphatase screens, the purified E. coli YfbR demonstrated high catalytic activity toward pNPP. The protein had a slightly alkaline pH optimum (pH 8.0) and an absolute requirement in a divalent metal cation for activity (Fig. 5A). Co2+ was the most efficient metal followed by Mn2+ and Cu2+. YfbR showed relatively low affinity to Co2+ (apparent KD = 0.8 ± 0.05 mm) and to pNPP (Km = 2.09 ± 0.13 mm) (Tables I and II). Screens with natural phosphatase substrates identified the presence of phosphatase activity in the E. coli YfbR against canonical deoxyribonucleoside 5′-monophosphates (Fig. 5B). The protein showed strict specificity toward deoxyribonucleoside 5′-monophosphates and did not hydrolyze ribonucleotides or deoxyribonucleoside 3′-monophosphates. YfbR had similar levels of activity (less than 2-fold difference) against all tested deoxyribonucleoside 5′-monophosphates (Fig. 5B). As with pNPP, the hydrolysis of deoxyribonucleoside monophosphates was strictly dependent on the presence of a divalent metal cation with Co2+ being the most efficient metal. With natural substrates (5′-dAMP), YfbR exhibited 8-fold higher affinity to Co2+ than with pNPP as a substrate (Table II). With all substrates, the protein showed saturation kinetics with highest affinity (and lowest activity) to dTMP, whereas highest activity was observed with dAMP (Table I). Similar to eukaryotic low Km 5′-nucleotidases (27Madrid-Marina V. Fox I.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 444-448Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 28Kaminska B.J. Madrid-Marina V. Fox I.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 449-452Google Scholar), the Km values for all natural substrates were in the micromolar range (Table I). Like the Helicobacter pylori 5′-nucleotidase HppA (29Reilly T.J. Calcutt M.J. Prot. Expr. Purif. 2004; 33: 48-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), the E. coli YfbR hydrolyzed natural substrates with lower rate than that for pNPP. However, the affinity to natural substrates was significantly higher (Table I). Similar rates of catalytic activities were also reported for 5′-nucleotidases from pig thyroid and from mouse liver (30Evans W.H. Gurd J.W. Biochem. J. 1973; 133: 189-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 31Niedzwiecka J. Jaroszewicz L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 221: 471-476Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). E. coli YjjG—The E. coli YjjG is annotated as a hypothetical protein with many homologues in different bacteria, archaea, and eukaryotes. Purified E. coli YjjG demonstrated high catalytic activity in general phosphatase screens with pNPP as a substrate (data not shown). The activity had a neutral pH optimum (pH 7.5) and a strict metal requirement (Mg2+ > Mn2+ > Co2+) (Fig. 6A). The protein showed highest activity in the presence of Mg2+ and had highest affinity to Co2+. Analysis of metal saturation curves revealed the presence of two plateaus suggesting the presence of two metal binding sites with different affinity or that the protein is oligomeric in solution. Our gelfiltration experiments (data not shown) support the second suggestion. The high affinity site had highest affinity to Mn2+ (KD = 10 ± 1.0 μm) followed by Co2+ (KD = 16.2 ± 1.4 μm) and Mg2+ (220 ± 30.0 μm), whereas the low affini"

Modification of the negatively charged phosphate groups of lipid A aids in resistance to cationic antimicrobial peptides targeting the bacterial cell surface. The lipid A of Helicobacter pylori contains a phosphoethanolamine (pEtN) unit directly linked to the 1-position of the disaccharide backbone. This is in contrast to the pEtN units found in other pathogenic Gram-negative bacteria, which are attached to the lipid A phosphate group to form a pyrophosphate linkage. This study describes two enzymes involved in the periplasmic modification of the 1-phosphate group of H. pylori lipid A. By using an in vitro assay system, we demonstrate the presence of lipid A 1-phosphatase activity in membranes of H. pylori. In an attempt to identify genes encoding possible lipid A phosphatases, we cloned four putative orthologs of Escherichia coli pgpB, the phosphatidylglycerol-phosphate phosphatase, from H. pylori 26695. One of these orthologs, Hp0021, is the structural gene for the lipid A 1-phosphatase and is required for removal of the 1-phosphate group from mature lipid A in an in vitro assay system. Heterologous expression of Hp0021 in E. coli resulted in the highly selective removal of the 1-phosphate group from E. coli lipid A, as demonstrated by mass spectrometry. We also identified the structural gene for the H. pylori lipid A pEtN transferase (Hp0022). Mass spectrometric analysis of the lipid A isolated from E. coli expressing Hp0021 and Hp0022 shows the addition of a single pEtN group at the 1-position, confirming that Hp0022 is responsible for the addition of a pEtN unit at the 1-position in H. pylori lipid A. In summary, we demonstrate that modification of the 1-phosphate group of H. pylori lipid A requires two enzymatic steps.

Unlike Gram-positive organisms, Gram-negative bacteria are further guarded from their environment by an asymmetric outer membrane that encapsulates their peptidoglycan. The outer leaflet of the outer membrane is composed mainly of lipopolysaccharide (LPS), 1The abbreviations used are: LPS, lipopolysaccharide; pEtN, phosphoethanolamine; MES, 2-(N-morpholino)ethanesulfonic acid; IPTG, iso-propyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside; Kdo, 3-deoxy-d-manno-octulosonic acid; MALDI-TOF, matrix assisted laser-desorption/time of flight. the major surface molecule of Gram-negative bacteria.

Attached to lipid A are the 3-deoxy-D-manno-octulosonic acid (Kdo) sugars (Fig. 1) that act as a bridge connecting the lipid A anchor to the core and O-antigen (1Raetz C.R. Whitfield C. Annu. Rev.

The typical lipid A backbone is a β, 1′-6-linked disaccharide of glucosamine that is bisphosphorylated and multiply acylated. In Escherichia coli, the disaccharide backbone is polyacylated with (R)-3-hydroxymyristate at the 2-, 3-, 2′-, and 3′-positions. The hydroxyl groups of the 2′- and 3′-linked fatty acyl chains are further esterified with laurate (C12) and myristate (C14), respectively (Fig. 1A) (1Raetz C.R. Whitfield C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2002; 71: 635-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (3423) Google Scholar, 2Raetz C.R. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1990; 59: 129-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (1041) Google Scholar, 5Raetz C.R.H. Niedhardt F.

Although a negatively charged hexa-acylated lipid A structure is characteristic in a number of Gram-negative animal pathogens, the lipid A structure can be further modified. The lipid A of Helicobacter pylori is quite unusual in that it lacks a 4′-phosphate group and is tri- or tetra-acylated with either (R)-3-hydroxystearate (C18) or (R)-3-hydroxypalmitate (C16) (Fig. 1C) (13Moran A.P.

Another unusual feature is that the C-1 hydroxyl group of the proximal glucosamine is derivatized with a phosphoethanolamine (pEtN) residue (13Moran A.P. Lindner B. Walsh E.J. J.

In addition to the low potency of H. pylori lipid A, the structure of the oligosaccharide portion of its LPS shows structural similarities to Lewis blood group antigens in the gastric mucosa, giving rise to a form of molecular mimicry that helps to camouflage the bacterium (23Appelmelk B.J.

Therefore, it has been theorized that H. pylori has evolved to have a less inflammatory LPS helping to prolong the chronic infections seen with this organism. A minor lipid A species found in H. pylori is both bisphosphorylated and hexa-acylated (Fig. 1B) resembling enterobacterial lipid As. We reasoned that the lipid A structure of H. pylori is modified following the constitutive lipid A pathway and that these modifications are not regulated given the structure of the major lipid A species shown in Fig. 1A. We report here two proteins, Hp0021 and Hp0022, involved in the variation of the H. pylori lipid A structure. Chemicals and Other Materials—[γ-32P]ATP and 32Pi were obtained from Amersham Biosciences. Silica Gel 60 (0.25-mm) thin layer plates were purchased from EM Separation Technology (Merck). Yeast extract and tryptone were from Difco. Triton X-100 and bicinchoninic acid were from Pierce. All other chemicals were reagent-grade and were purchased from either Sigma or Mallinckrodt. Bacterial Strains and Growth Conditions—The bacterial strains and plasmids used in this study are summarized in Table I. H. pylori strains J99 and 26695 were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection. Primary plate cultures of H. pylori were grown from glycerol stock on blood agar medium at 37 °C for 36-60 h in a microaerobic atmosphere (5% O2, 10% CO2, and 85% N2). The resultant colonies were inoculated in Brucella broth (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Hyclone) and vancomycin (10 μg/ml). Cells were grown to an A600 of 1.0 at 37 °C under microaerobic conditions for 24-36 h. Prior to every experiment, confirmation of H. pylori was performed by both Gram's stain and urease test. E. coli was typically grown at 37 °C in Luria-Bertani (LB) broth, which consisted of 10 g of NaCl, 10 g of tryptone, and 5 g of yeast extract per liter (26Miller J.R.

Cloning of Putative H. pylori Orthologs of E. coli pgpB and hp0022—H. pylori orthologs of E. coli pgpB (hp0021, hp0350, hp0851, and hp1580) and N. meningitidis lptA (60Que-Gewirth N.L. Lin S.

The genes were amplified by PCR using H. pylori strain 26695 genomic DNA as the template. The forward and reverse primer sequences of H. pylori pgpB and lptA orthologs are described in Table II. The forward primers contained a clamp region, an NdeI site (Table II, underlined), and a match to the coding strand starting at the translation initiation start site. The reverse primers were designed with a clamp region, a BamHI site (Table II, underlined), and a match to the anti-coding strand that included a stop codon. The PCR mixture contained 100 ng of genomic DNA template, 150 ng of each primer, 200 μm of each dNTP, 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.8, 35 mm MgCl2, 250 mm KCl, and 2.5 units of Pfu DNA polymerase (Stratagene) in a reaction volume of 0.05 ml. The reaction mixtures were subjected to a 90-s denaturation at 95 °C followed by 30 cycles of 95 °C for 60 s, 56 °C for 60 s, 72 °C for 60 s, and a final extension for 10 min at 72 °C, using the Stratagene RoboCyler Gradient 40 PCR system. The PCR products and vectors were digested with NdeI and BamHI, gel-purified, and ligated together. Plasmid constructs derived from pET21a(+) designated pHp0021, pHp0350, pHp0851, pHp1580, and pHp0022 were transformed into XL-1 Blue cells (Stratagene) for propagation of the plasmid. The plasmids were then screened for positive inserts and confirmed by DNA sequencing.Table IIOligonucleotidesNameSequenceU-hp0022-NdeI5′-GCGCGCCATATGTTGGCATCATTATTCCAT-3′L-hp0022-BamHI5′-GCGCGCGGATCCTTACTCTTTTTTGTGTTT-3′U-hp0021-NdeI5′-GCGCGCCATATGAAAAAATTCTTATTTAAA-3′L-hp0221-BamHI5′-GCGCGCGGATCCTTAAGGCTTTTTGGGGCT-3′U-hp0350-NdeI5′-GCGCGCCATATGCTGAAAATTCTTTCAAA-3′L-hp0350-BamHI5′-GCGCGCGGATCCTTAGATCTTTTGAAACAC-3′U-hp0851-NdeI5′-GCGCGCCATATGTATTTGACAGAACAATC-3′L-hp0851-BamHI5′-GCGCGCGGATCCTTATTGATTATAAGGGCG-3′U-hp1580-NdeI5′-GCGCGCCATATGCTATTTAATGGGCTATGC-3′L-hp1580-BamHI5′-GCGCGCGGATCCTTACCATTGATAAGAAAA-3′U-hp0021coco-NsiI5′-GCGCGCCATGCATAAAAAATTCTTATTTAAA-3′L-hp0021coco-BstBI5′-GCGCGCCTTCGAATTAAGGCTTTTTGGGGCT-3′U-hp0350coco-NsiI5′-GCGCGCCATGCATGCTGAAAATTCTTTCAAA-3′L-hp0350coco-BstBI5′-GCGCGCCTTCGAATTAGATCTTTTGAAACAC-3′U-hp0851coco-NsiI5′-GCGCGCCATGCATGTATTTGACAGAACAATC-3′L-hp0851coco-BstBI5′-GCGCGCCTTCGAATTATTGATTATAAGGGCG-3′U-hp1580coco-NsiI5′-GCGCGCCATGCATCTATTTAATGGGCTATGC-3′L-hp1580coco-BstBI5′-GCGCGCCTTCGAATTACCATTGATAAGAAAA-3′htrBUpper5′-GCGCGCCATATGATGACGAATCTACCC-3′htrBLower5′-GCGGCGGGATCCTTAATAGCGTGAAGG-3′ Open table in a new tab Additionally, hp0021 was cloned into the expression vector pWSK29 (77Wang R.F. Kushner S.R. Gene (Amst.). 1991; 100: 195-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (1013) Google Scholar). The plasmid pHp0021 was subjected to restriction enzyme digest with XbaI and XhoI. The resulting fragment containing hp0021 was ligated into pWSK29 previously digested with XbaI and XhoI resulting in the vector pWSHp0021. High Copy Expression of Putative PgpB and LptA Orthologs behind a T7lac Promoter—The H. pylori PgpB and LptA ortholog constructs derived from pET21a(+) were transformed into NovaBlue(DE3) (Table I) for overexpression of the protein. First, a single colony of E. coli harboring either the empty vector control or the recombinant expression plasmid were inoculated into 50 ml of LB broth and grown overnight (∼16 h) in a rotary shaker at 37 °C to A600 ∼1. The appropriate amount of overnight culture was used to inoculate 200 ml of fresh LB broth with an initial Α600 of 0.05. Prior to induction with 1 mm IPTG, cells were allowed to reach mid-log phase of growth (Α600 ∼0.6). After induction with IPTG, the cells were left shaking for an additional 4 h. To determine the level of protein expression, membrane proteins were isolated (see below), separated by SDS-PAGE, and stained with Coomassie gel code blue staining reagent (Pierce). Unfortunately, expression of Hp0021, Hp0350, Hp0851, Hp1580, or Hp0022 in E. coli NovaBlue(DE3) did not result in any distinct protein bands (data not shown). Cloning of Putative PgpB Orthologs into a Low Copy Expression Vector—PCR-amplified pgpB orthologs (hp0021, hp0350, hp0851, and hp1580) from H. pylori strain 26695 were cloned into pETCoco-2 for low copy replication and protein expression. The forward and reverse primer sequences of pgpB orthologs cloned into pETCoco-2 are described in Table II. The forward primers for pgpB orthologs contained a clamp region, an NsiI site (Table II, underlined), and a match to the coding strand beginning at the translation initiation start site. The reverse primers were designed with a clamp region, a BstBI site (Table II, underlined), and a match to the anti-coding strand that included a stop codon. Amplification was carried out as mentioned previously. The PCR products and vector were digested with NsiI and BstBI, gel-purified, and ligated together. Plasmid constructs derived from pETCoco-2 designated pHp0021coco, pHp0350coco, pHp0851coco, and pHp1580coco were transformed into NovaF- cells (Novagen) for plasmid propagation. All constructs derived from pETCoco-2 were maintained in the single copy state with LB broth containing ampicillin (50 μg/ml) and 0.2% d-glucose at all times to ensure maximum stability, except during culturing for plasmid DNA isolation. Plasmid propagation of pETCoco-2-derived constructs was typically grown by inoculating a single colony of E. coli containing an empty or recombinant plasmid into 5 ml of LB broth supplemented with ampicillin and 0.2% glucose and grown overnight (∼16 h) in a rotary shaker (250 rpm) at 37 °C. The overnight cultures were diluted to 1:50 with fresh LB broth containing ampicillin without glucose because the sugar prevents amplification of the plasmid. Cells were induced with 0.01% l-arabinose for plasmid replication at an A600 of 0.4. The cells were allowed to grow for an additional 4 h prior to harvest for plasmid purification. Plasmid constructs were then screened for positive inserts, confirmed by DNA sequencing, and transformed into E. coli K12 strain HMS174(DE3) cells (Novagen) for low copy expression. Low Copy Expression of Putative Orthologs of PgpB—Low copy expression of pETCoco-2 derivatives was performed according to the instructions described by Novagen. Typically, a single colony of E. coli harboring either the empty vector control or the recombinant expression plasmid was inoculated into 5 ml of LB broth supplemented with ampicillin and 0.2% glucose and grown overnight at 37 °C. Overnight cultures were then used to inoculate 20 ml of fresh LB broth containing ampicillin with or without glucose at an initial A600 of 0.05. At mid-log phase of growth, the cells were induced with 0.5 mm IPTG and allowed to grow for an additional 3 h before harvesting. Isolation and Analysis of Lipid A Species from 32Pi-Labeled Cells—Cells containing pETCoco-2 derivatives were grown as described above. Upon induction at mid-log phase with IPTG, the cells were labeled uniformly with 2.5 μCi/ml 32Pi for an additional 3 h at 37 °C. Bacteria were collected using a clinical centrifuge and washed with 5 ml of phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4. To extract the 32P-labeled phospholipids, the cell pellet was resuspended in 3 ml of a single-phase Bligh/Dyer mixture (27Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Med. Sci. 1959; 37: 911-917Google Scholar), consisting of chloroform/methanol/water (1:2:0.8, v/v). After mixing and incubating for 30 min at room temperature, the insoluble residue, containing the 32P-labeled lipid A still covalently bound to LPS, was recovered by centrifugation. The residue was subjected to hydrolysis at 100 °C in 12.5 mm sodium acetate buffer, pH 4.5, in the presence of 1% SDS to cleave the Kdo-lipid A linkage (16Zhou Z. Lin S. Cotter R.J. Raetz C.R. J.

The plate was developed in the solvent chloroform, pyridine, 88% formic acid, water (50:50:16:5, v/v). The plate was dried and exposed to a PhosphorImager Screen overnight to visualize the resolved 32P-lipid A species. Cloning and Expression of H. pylori Hp0021 and Hp0022 in a Dual Expression System—The plasmid constructs, pHp0021 and pETDuet-1, were subjected to restriction enzyme digest with NcoI and BamHI. The resulting Hp0021 DNA fragment was isolated and ligated into the multiple cloning site 1 of pETDuet-1 to derive the plasmid construct pHp0021duet. In addition, the plasmid constructs pHp0022, pETDuet-1, and pHp0021duet were subjected to restriction enzyme digested with NdeI and XhoI. The resulting Hp0022 DNA fragment was ligated into the MSC2 of both pETDuet-1 and pHp0021duet vectors to generate the plasmid constructs pHp0022duet and pHp0021/Hp0022, respectively. All of the plasmids derived from pETDuet-1 were transformed into XL-1 Blue cells for propagation of the plasmids, screened for positive inserts, and confirmed by DNA sequencing. The plasmids pHp0021duet, pHp0022duet, or pHp0021/Hp0022 were then transformed into the E. coli expression strain NovaBlue(DE3) and overexpressed as described previously. Cloning and Expression of the E. coli Late Acyltransferases, LpxL and LpxM, behind a T7lac Promoter—The lpxL structural gene was obtained by PCR using W3110 genomic DNA as the template. The lpxM structural gene was cloned and the protein overexpressed as described previously (29Vorachek-Warren M.K. Ramirez S. Cotter R.J. Raetz C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 14194-14205Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Primer sequences for lpxL are described in Table II. The lpxL PCR product was digested with NdeI and BamHI and ligated into the similarly digested vector pET21a(+). The resulting plasmid, pHtrB, was transformed into BLR(DE3)/pLysS cells (Novagen) for protein expression. Cells were grown in LB broth at 37 °C to A600 of ∼0.6, followed by induction with 1 mm IPTG and further incubation at 37 °C for an additional 4 h. Preparation of Cell-free Extracts, Double-spun Cytosol, and Washed Membrane—Typically, 500 ml of H. pylori or 200 ml of E. coli cultures were grown to an Α600 of 1.0 at 37 °C and harvested by centrifugation at 6,000 × g for 30 min. All samples were prepared at 4 °C. Cell-free extract, double-spun cytosol, and washed membranes were prepared as described previously (30Trent M.S. Pabich W. Raetz C.R. Miller S.I. J. Biol.

Kdo2-4′-32P-lipid IVA was prepared by adding purified E. coli Kdo transferase (WaaA) immediately after the 4′-kinase, as described previously (33Basu S.S. York J.D. Raetz C.R. J. Biol.

https://openalex.org/W2034879954,"Fluorescent labels are commonly used to investigate the mechanisms of cellular uptake and intracellular distribution of cell-penetrating peptides. However, labels such as fluorescein and rhodamine are relatively large and very lipophilic and may significantly alter physicochemical properties of small peptides. To minimize the impact of the fluorescent probe on a tetrapeptide, we substituted one of the amino acids (Lys4) in a tetrapeptide ([Dmt1]DALDA, Dmt-D-Arg-Phe-Lys-NH2 where Dmt = 2',6'-dimethyltyrosine) with two different fluorescent amino acids (beta-dansyl-L-alpha,beta-diaminopropionic acid (dnsDap4) or beta-anthraniloyl-L-alpha,beta-diaminopropionic acid (atnDap4)). Initial studies with confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) showed very different localization patterns for the two fluorescent analogs, with [Dmt1,atnDap4]DALDA showing mitochondrial localization and [Dmt1,dnsDap4]DALDA showing diffuse cytoplasmic localization. Studies with isolated mouse liver mitochondria suggested that [Dmt1,dnsDap4]DALDA targeted the mitochondrial matrix resulting in mitochondrial depolarization, opening of the permeability transition pore, mitochondrial swelling, and rapid release of the peptide into the cytoplasm. In contrast, [Dmt1,atnDap4]DALDA was retained in the inner mitochondrial membrane and did not induce mitochondrial swelling. Furthermore, [Dmt1,atnDap4]DALDA protected mitochondria against Ca2+-induced swelling. Importantly, the unlabeled parent peptide [Dmt1]DALDA behaved like [Dmt1,atnDap4]DALDA and was mitoprotective. These findings suggest that experimental results obtained with fluorescent labels must be interpreted with caution, and the use of multiple fluorophores, together with confirmation using the original or radiolabeled molecule, is recommended."
https://openalex.org/W2077896466,"We describe here the construction of a library of small interfering RNA expression vectors targeted to a few hundred apoptosis-related genes and the application of this library to an investigation of thapsigargin (TG)-induced apoptosis. Thapsigargin triggers endoplasmic reticulum stress, with subsequent apoptosis, but the molecular mechanisms underlying this process are incompletely understood. Using our library, we identified three anti-apoptotic genes, namely, NOXA, E2F1, and MAPK1, in addition to already characterized genes in the apoptotic pathway. In contrast to proposals by others, our data revealed (i) that TG-induced apoptosis is associated with Apaf1 in a caspase-3- and caspase-9-independent manner; (ii) that the E2F1-PUMA pathway might be involved; and (iii) that the ERK pathway, via MAP3K8 (mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase 8), is required for the induction by TG of apoptosis. Our study demonstrates clearly that unexpected and novel genes can be identified effectively by our method, and it provides evidence for the efficacy and utility of the comprehensive analysis of signaling networks and pathways using a library of small interfering RNA expression vectors.

Although the human genome has been sequenced, the functions of many genes remain unknown. Phenotypic analysis using gene silencing appears to be an effective strategy in efforts to understand gene functions, and exploitation of RNA interference (RNAi) 1The abbreviations used are: RNAi, RNA interference; siRNA, small interfering RNA; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; TG, thapsigargin; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; z, benzyloxycarbonyl; fmk, fluoromethyl ketone; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; MAP3K8, mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase 8; JNK, c-Jun amino-terminal kinase. appears to be a novel and powerful approach to the silencing of specific genes (1Dykxhoorn D.M. Novina C.D. Sharp P.A. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 6: 457-467Crossref Scopus (1024) Google Scholar). RNAi is an intrinsic and evolutionarily conserved phenomenon in plants and animals whereby double-stranded RNA induces the sequence-specific degradation of homologous RNA (2Fire A. Xu S. Montgomery M.K. Kostas S.A. Driver S.E. Mello C.C. Nature. 1998; 391: 806-811Crossref PubMed Scopus (11908) Google Scholar). Genome-wide RNAi screening in Caenorhabditis elegans and Drosophila cells, using libraries of double-stranded RNAs, has been demonstrated to be extremely useful in efforts to identify genes that regulate various processes and has enhanced our understanding of various biological processes (3Fraser A.G.

First, double-stranded RNA induces an antiviral response that can result in cell death (7Stark G.R. Kerr I.M. Williams B.R. Silverman R.H. Schreiber R.D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 227-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (3388) Google Scholar). However, Tuschl and co-workers (8Elbashir S.M. Harborth J. Lendeckel W. Yalcin A. Weber K. Tuschl T.

The second problem is that the effectiveness of siRNA is strongly dependent on the target sites in target RNAs. To generate a high quality library, we developed an original algorithm that allows us to predict favorable target sites (17Miyagishi M. Taira K. Oligonucleotides. 2003; 13: 325-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Using this algorithm and our optimized siRNA expression system (17Miyagishi M. Taira K. Oligonucleotides. 2003; 13: 325-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), we are now constructing an siRNA expression library that will encompass the complete array of transcripts from the human genome. In this study, for construction of our first siRNA library, we focused on an apoptotic pathway and generated a library targeted to apoptosis-related genes. We used this library to screen for genes involved in endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress-dependent apoptosis induced by thapsigargin (TG), a plant-derived sesquiterpene lactone. Culture and Transfection of Cells—HCT116 cells were cultured in McCoy's 5A medium, supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% penicillin/streptomycin. Transfections of siRNA expression vectors were performed using Lipofectamine™ 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Construction of a Library for Expression of U6-driven siRNA—We prepared siRNA vectors using the vector piGENE PURhU6 (17Miyagishi M. Taira K. Oligonucleotides. 2003; 13: 325-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), which contains a human U6 promoter, a puromycin resistance gene, and two BspMI sites, which are used as sites for cloning a short hairpin sequence. For construction of siRNA vectors, we synthesized oligonucleotides with hairpin, terminator, and overhanging sequences. We annealed these fragments and inserted them into the BspMI sites of piGENE PURhU6. We based the sequences that we inserted immediately downstream of each U6 promoter on the results of application of our algorithm (17Miyagishi M. Taira K. Oligonucleotides. 2003; 13: 325-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Each vector was designed to express a short hairpin RNA in transfected cells. Western Blotting Analysis—Preparation of cell lysates, Western blotting, and immunodetection were performed as described previously (18Futami T. Miyagishi M. Iwai S. Seki M. Taira K. Antisense Nucleic Acid Drug Dev. 2003; 13: 9-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). Antibodies against caspase-3, caspase-8, capsase-9, Bid, poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase, ERK1/2, and phospho-ERK1/2 (Cell Signaling Technology), DR5 (CHEMICON), PUMA (ProSci Inc.), E2F1 (Santa Cruz), caspase-7 (BD PharMingen), and actin (Sigma) were used as suggested by the respective manufacturers. Second antibodies conjugated to horseradish peroxidase were obtained from Amersham Biosciences. Flow Cytometry Analysis—Harvested cells aliquots (106 cells/assay) were permeabilized with 0.2% Triton-X100, centrifuged, and resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline that contained RNase A for 5 min at room temperature, and then propidium iodide (final concentration, 50 μg/ml) was added to the suspension. Fluorescence was monitored with flow cytometer (Becton Dickinson). Materials—TG, z-VAD-fmk, and z-VAD-IETD were purchased from Calbiochem. Construction of the siRNA Expression Vector Library—Prior to the construction of the siRNA expression library, we optimized our siRNA expression system. We constructed three types of siRNA vector system, namely, tandem-type, dual promoter-type, and hairpin-type, and compared the activities of the siRNAs. We determined that the hairpin-type system had the highest suppressive activity for low copy number plasmids. However, we observed a high rate of mutation in the stem-loop region when plasmids were used to transform Escherichia coli. This phenomenon was a serious problem with respect to the construction of a reliable library of siRNA vectors. We found that introduction of multiple C to T (or A to G) mutations into the sense strand rendered the plasmids genetically stable and did not affect silencing activity (17Miyagishi M. Taira K. Oligonucleotides. 2003; 13: 325-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Moreover, we optimized the loop sequence that connected sense and antisense sequences and other parameters that might affect the activity of the siRNA. Furthermore, we developed an algorithm for selection of effective target sequences (17Miyagishi M. Taira K. Oligonucleotides. 2003; 13: 325-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Together, the optimization of the siRNA expression system and the development of the algorithm enabled us to construct a large scale and high quality library of siRNA vectors. Thapsigargin-induced Caspase-dependant Apoptosis—We focused on the ER stress-induced apoptotic pathway as the target of our initial siRNA expression library. We chose 241 apoptosis-related genes, including genes for kinases, caspases, transcription factors, and other already characterized genes that are known to be associated with various apoptotic pathways. To take off-target effects into account (19Jackson A.L. Bartz S.R. Schelter J. Kobayashi S.V. Burchard J. Mao M. Li B. Cavet G. Linsley P.S. Nat. Biotechnol. 2003; 21: 635-637Crossref PubMed Scopus (1927) Google Scholar), we constructed siRNA vectors directed at two target sites within each gene. Although there are many reports of the involvement of a number of specific genes in ER stress-induced apoptosis, the signal transduction pathway remains to be fully defined. Therefore, to clarify the details of the ER stress-induced apoptotic pathway, we screened the siRNA expression library for siRNA that targeted genes that might be involved in TG-induced apoptosis. First, we confirmed that cell death caused by TG is, in fact, apoptosis under our experimental conditions. TG clearly induced apoptotic cell death in human colon carcinoma HCT116 cells, as demonstrated by fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis, during which we observed a characteristic sub-G1 peak, indicative of DNA fragmentation and a hallmark of apoptosis, in the case of TG-treated cells (Fig. 1A). Moreover, cleavage of anti-poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase, another hallmark of apoptosis, occurred 24 h after the start of treatment of cells with TG (Fig. 1B). Incubation of cells with both TG and a pan-caspase inhibitor, z-VAD-fmk or the caspase-8 inhibitor z-IETD-fmk significantly blocked the appearance of the sub-G1 peak, indicating that the apoptotic process was caspase-dependent and, specifically, caspase-8-dependent. We also examined the possible role of a death receptor (DR5), which is involved in the induction of apoptosis via the recruitment and the cleavage of caspase-8, in TG-induced apoptosis in HCT116 cells. Recent studies have implicated the death receptor (DR5) pathway in TG-induced apoptosis in several lines of cancer cells (20He Q. Montalbano J. Corcoran C. Jin W. Huang Y. Sheikh M.S. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 2674-2679Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). TG induced the expression of the DR5 protein, which became apparent 12 h after the onset of treatment, and “knockdown” experiments using an siRNA vector targeted to DR5 mRNA revealed that the DR5 apoptotic pathway was blocked by this vector (see below). Collectively, our results suggested that TG-induced apoptosis involved the DR5-mediated activation of caspase-8. Confirmation of the RNAi Effect on Endogenous Genes—Prior to this study, we developed an algorithm for the identification of target sites using siRNA data sets obtained with reporter genes, such as genes for luciferases and green fluorescent protein (17Miyagishi M. Taira K. Oligonucleotides. 2003; 13: 325-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). In this study, we examined whether or not the algorithm is applicable to endogenous genes. We constructed siRNA vectors directed against genes for caspases 3, 7, 8, and 9 and DR5, all of which might be involved in TG-induced apoptosis. As noted above, we used two different target sites per gene in these experiments. As shown in Fig. 2, Western blotting analysis indicated that the level of each respective protein was markedly reduced in cells that had been transfected with the siRNA vector targeted to the corresponding gene, whereas the control vector, targeted to the gene for the unrelated luciferase from Renilla (Rluc) had no effect. The levels of actin were unchanged, indicating that the effects of the siRNA vectors were specific to each respective gene (Fig. 2, A-E). These results suggested that our algorithm had allowed us to select appropriate sequences in endogenous genes (17Miyagishi M. Taira K. Oligonucleotides. 2003; 13: 325-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). We also investigated the effects of siRNA vectors targeted to other genes by Western blotting. We confirmed that 70-80% of our siRNA vectors targeted to endogenous genes were able to silence these target genes very effectively. Screening Strategy—We set the conditions for screening our siRNA expression library for the siRNAs that targeted genes involved in TG-induced apoptosis using an siRNA vector targeted to caspase-8 mRNA as a positive control. First, we investigated the duration of the effects of RNAi at the protein level after transfection of cells with this siRNA vector. To remove nontransfected cells, we treated cells with 2 μg/ml puromycin for 36-48 h and then analyzed levels of caspase-8. Reductions in levels of caspase-8 were sustained for at least 72-120 h after transfection, and inhibitory effects on apoptosis were observed over the same time range (Fig. 2F and data not shown). Under similar conditions, we used the siRNA expression library to screen for apoptosis-related genes. Thus, 36 h after transfection, we selected transfected cells by exposing cells to 2 μg/ml puromycin for 36 h. Then same number of cells were transferred in triplicate to a 96-well plate. After a further 12 h, we treated with 1 μm TG for another 48 h. Then we fixed the cells and stained them with crystal violet. Negative control cells that had been transfected with siRNA vectors targeting to Rluc and other unrelated transgenes were all dead by the treatment of TG (Fig. 2F, right lane). Under this condition, siRNA expression vector library was screened, and we selected siRNA vectors that made cells survive after treatment with TG. We identified the siRNA vectors specific for several genes that suppressed TG-induced apoptosis (Table I and Fig. 2H). Targeted genes were divided into three classes according to the extent of cell survival.Table IList of targeted genes that promoted TG-induced apoptosisTargeted geneAccession numberInhibitory effect of siRNATranscription factorsE2F1NM_005225++CaspasesCaspase-8NM_001228+++Members of the bcl-2 familyBadNM_004322+BidNM_001196+PUMANM_014417+NOXANM_021127++MAPKsMAP3K8NM_005204++MAP3K6NM_004672+MAP3K3NM_002401+MAP2K2NM_030662++MAPK1NM_002745++OthersDR5NM_003842+VDACNM_003374+++Apaf1NM_001160++ Open table in a new tab Caspases—The strong inhibitory effect of the siRNA vector for the gene directed against caspase-8 indicated that this enzyme is a key molecule in TG-induced apoptosis. Cells transfected with siRNA vectors directed against DR5 mRNA resisted TG-induced apoptosis, but their survival was poorer than that of cells that had been transfected with siRNA vectors against the gene for caspase-8. In terms of protein levels, DR5-specific siRNA vectors almost completely suppressed the expression of DR5 (Fig. 2D), suggesting the possible existence of a DR5-independent pathway(s) for activation of caspase-8 that involves other receptors (such as FAS and tumor necrosis factor α receptors) or, perhaps, of a receptor-independent caspase activation pathway(s). The suppression caused by siRNA vectors directed against Apaf1, VDAC, and Bid indicated that the TG-induced apoptotic pathway also involved mitochondria. By contrast, the siRNA vectors targeted to genes for caspase-9 and caspase-3 failed to suppress TG-induced apoptosis (Fig. 2G) despite the almost complete suppression of the expression of these two genes (Fig. 2, A and C). However, siRNA vectors directed against genes for caspase-3 and caspase-9 did block apoptosis that was induced by stimuli other than TG (e.g. double-stranded RNA; data not shown). Although it has been proposed that both caspase-9 and Apaf1 are necessary for the activation of downstream caspases, Ho et al. (21Ho A.T. Li Q.H. Hakem R. Mak T.W. Zacksenhaus E. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 460-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) recently reported the presence of a caspase-9-dependent and Apaf1-independent apoptotic pathway in myoblast. Our data indicate that TG-induced apoptosis is dependent on Apaf1 but not on caspase-9 or on caspase-3, leading to the first identification, to our knowledge, of components of an apoptotic pathway downstream of mitochondria. Bcl-2 and BH3-only Protein Families—The siRNA vectors targeted against the Bad, PUMA, and NOXA genes for the members of the Bcl-2 homology domain 3 family (the BH3-only protein family) inhibited TG-induced apoptosis. When pro-apoptotic members of the Bcl-2 family, such as Bax and Bak, are activated, they increase the permeability of the outer mitochondrial membrane and induce the release of pro-apoptotic proteins from the mitochondria. In normal cells, anti-apoptotic members of the Bcl-2 family, such as Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL, inhibit this activation and support cell survival. BH3-only proteins inhibit the actions of anti-apoptotic members of the Bcl-2 family and induce apoptosis. When levels of cytoplasmic Ca2+ ions rise, after treatment of cells with TG, Bad is activated and translocated to mitochondria (22Wang H.G. Pathan N. Ethell I.M. Krajewski S. Yamaguchi Y. Shibasaki F. McKeon F. Bobo T. Franke T.F. Reed J.C. Science. 1999; 284: 339-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (967) Google Scholar). Thus, Bad might be a candidate for a messenger that conveys a signal from the ER to the mitochondria. The siRNA vectors targeted against the PUMA and NOXA genes also inhibited TG-induced apoptosis. These genes induce apoptosis in response to DNA damage or to the overexpression of p53, but there are no reports that NOXA regulates ER stress-induced apoptosis. Moreover, Reimertz et al. (23Reimertz C. Kogel D. Rami A. Chittenden T. Prehn J.H. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 162: 587-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar) suggested that PUMA might be both sufficient and necessary for ER stress-induced apoptosis. To identify components of the apoptotic pathway downstream of the BH3-only proteins, we investigated the activation of the caspase cascade in cells that had been transfected with siRNA vectors directed against the gene for caspase-8, NOXA, and PUMA (Fig. 3). The siRNA vectors against PUMA or NOXA blocked the activation of caspase-9 but failed to prevent the processing of caspase-3 and Bid. These observations indicated that NOXA and PUMA act upstream of a mitochondrial pathway (an intrinsic pathway) but are not part of the extrinsic pathway that is initiated by activation of cell surface death receptors and subsequent direct cleavage of caspase-3 by caspase-8. By contrast, the siRNA vector directed against the gene for caspase-8 prevented the processing of Bid, caspase-9, and caspase-3, suggesting that caspase-8 might operate upstream of both the intrinsic pathway, presumably via activation of Bid (24Cory S. Adams J.M. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2002; 2: 647-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (3349) Google Scholar), and the extrinsic pathway. Numerous studies, including “knockout” experiments, have indicated that individual BH3-only proteins have specialized physiological roles. For example, Bim plays a role in the cytotoxic response of lymphocytes to cytokine deprivation and to taxol, whereas Bmf seems to be required for anoikis (apoptosis triggered by loss of contact with the extracellular matrix) (24Cory S. Adams J.M. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2002; 2: 647-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (3349) Google Scholar). Our data demonstrated the involvement of several BH3-only proteins in the apoptotic pathway and showed that each of these BH3-only proteins is essential for the induction of apoptosis, suggesting the possible importance of the coordination of the activities of several BH3-only proteins in apoptosis. Protein Kinases—Our screening revealed the involvement of members of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) family in TG-induced apoptosis. MAPKs regulate the activity of transcription factors or downstream kinases by phosphorylation, thereby controlling a variety of physiological processes. MAPKs can be classified broadly into three categories: the ERKs, the c-Jun amino-terminal kinase (JNK), and the MAPK p38 (p38). In our screening, we identified siRNA vectors that targeted genes for ERK2 (MAPK1), MAP2K2, and MAP3Ks (MAP3K3, MAP3K6, and MAP3K8), and we identified these genes as genes that might be involved in TG-induced apoptosis (Table I). To confirm the involvement of the ERK pathway in TG-induced apoptosis, we examined the activation of ERK1/ERK2 by Western blotting with a phospho-ERK-specific antibody. As shown in Fig. 4A, ERK1/ERK2 was activated 1 h after the start of treatment of cells with TG. Furthermore, suppression of the expression of MAP3K8 clearly impaired the activation of ERK after the start of treatment with TG (Fig. 4B). Although the activation of the ERK and JNK/p38 cascades are generally considered to participate in survival and in stress/death signaling, respectively (25Murray B. Alessandrini A. Cole A.J. Yee A.G. Furshpan E.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 11975-11980Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar), we failed to detect the involvement of JNK/p38 in TG-induced apoptosis in our screening, even though some siRNA vectors targeted to JNK and p38 were identified as anti-apoptotic siRNAs in our screening for genes in other apoptotic pathways. 2S. Matsumoto, M. Miyagishi, H. Akashi, R. Nagai, and K. Taira, unpublished data. Collectively, our results suggest that the activity of ERKs, mediated by MAP3K8, but probably not JNK/p38, might play a pro-apoptotic role in TG-induced apoptosis. Transcription Factors—An siRNA vector directed against E2F1 also acted as a suppressor of TG-induced apoptosis (Fig. 5, A and B). E2F1, a member of the E2F family of transcription factors, is known for its involvement of DNA replication during cell proliferation. E2F1 also regulates apoptosis, and a number of E2F1-regulated genes, including genes for ARF, p73, Apaf1, and BH3-only proteins, participate in apoptosis (26Muller H. Bracken A.P. Vernell R.

Chem. 2004; 279: 8627-8634Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). The expression of E2F1 is enhanced and E2F1 induces apoptosis in response to DNA damage (30Pediconi N. Ianari A. Costanzo A. Belloni L. Gallo R. Cimino L. Porcellini A. Screpanti I. Balsano C. Alesse E. Gulino A. Levrero M. Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 552-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). It seems possible that suppression of the expression of E2F1 might result in the blockage of TG-induced apoptosis. Hershko and Ginsberg (29Hershko T. Ginsberg D. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 8627-8634Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar) showed that ectopic expression of E2F1 enhanced the expression of the pro-apoptotic BH3-only protein PUMA via direct involvement in transcription in NIH3T3 cells. As noted above, siRNA vectors directed against PUMA suppressed TG-induced apoptosis, and E2F1 appeared to regulate TG-induced apoptosis via regulation of the expression of PUMA. Reimertz et al. (23Reimertz C. Kogel D. Rami A. Chittenden T. Prehn J.H. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 162: 587-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar) demonstrated that significant induction of PUMA in response to TG, and our Western blotting analysis demonstrated that enhancement of the expression of PUMA occurred after treatment of cells with TG (Fig. 5C). This enhancement was not observed in cells in which the expression of PUMA was suppressed via the siRNA vector directed against E2F1 (Fig. 5D). These results suggest that endogenous E2F1 might regulate TG-induced apoptosis via regulation of the expression of PUMA. The data presented here, together with those from other studies (31Rutkowski D.T. Kaufman R.J. Trends Cell Biol. 2004; 4: 20-28Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (1196) Google Scholar), suggest a model for TG-induced apoptosis, as shown in Fig. 5E. By screening our siRNA expression library, we were able to identify some novel pathways in TG-induced apoptosis in HCT116 cells. We first detected the death receptor/caspase-8 pathway, which seems to induce both the mitochondrial pathway via cleavage of Bid, and the extrinsic pathway, which bypasses the mitochondrial pathway. We also observed the involvement of three BH3 proteins, which might induce the mitochondrial pathway. Transcription factors in the E2F family appeared to enhance the expression of PUMA. The ERK pathway, which was activated transiently 1 h after the start of treatment with TG and is mediated by MAP3K8, might be part of the TG-induced apoptotic pathway. In preliminary experiments, designed to determine hierarchical relationships among these pathways, we found that the ERK pathway does not appear to be located upstream of the death receptor/caspase-8 pathway and the mitochondrial pathway, and it seems likely that the ERK pathway functions as an independent pathway (data not shown). The most significant advantages of our siRNA expression library as compared with the widely used synthetic siRNA library are as follows. The interferon response in transfected cells can be avoided (32Miyagishi M. Matsumoto M. Futami T. Akashi H. Appasani K. Takagi Y. Sutou S. Kadowaki T. Nagai R. Taira K. Appasani K. RNA Interference Technology. Cambridge University Press, in press2005Google Scholar), and the RNAi effect is sustained for a longer period of time than the inhibitory effects of synthetic siRNAs, in particular in proliferating cells. Using our siRNA expression library, we demonstrated here the straightforward identification of novel pathways that had not been identified by other available strategies. We have already constructed siRNA libraries directed against the genes for all the kinases and phosphatases in the human genome and against other genes as well. Further analyses using our large libraries of siRNA expression vectors should provide more precise information about various signaling pathways and enhance our understanding of numerous physiological phenomena.

These Ca2+ channels assemble in (hetero)tetrameric channel complexes with different functional characteristics regarding Ca2+-dependent inactivation, ion selectivity, and pharmacological block. Glutathione S-transferase pull-downs and co-immunoprecipitations demonstrated an essential role of the intracellular N- and C-tails in TRPV5 channel assembly by physical interactions between N-N tails, C-C tails, and N-C-tails. Patch clamp analysis in human embryonic kidney (HEK293) cells and 45Ca2+ uptake experiments in Xenopus laevis oocytes co-expressing TRPV5 wild-type and truncated proteins indicated that TRPV5ΔN (deleted N-tail) and TRPV5ΔC (deleted C-tail) decreased channel activity of wild-type TRPV5 in a dominant-negative manner, whereas TRPV5ΔNΔC (deleted N-tail/C-tail) did not affect TRPV5 activity. Oocytes co-expressing wild-type TRPV5 and TRPV5ΔN or TRPV5ΔC showed virtually no wild-type TRPV5 expression on the plasma membrane, whereas co-expression of wild-type TRPV5 and TRPV5ΔNΔC displayed normal channel surface expression. This indicates that TRPV5 trafficking toward the plasma membrane was disturbed by assembly with TRPV5ΔN or TRPV5ΔC but not with TRPV5ΔNΔC. TRPV5 channel assembly signals were refined between amino acid positions 64–77 and 596–601 in the N-tail and C-tail, respectively. Pull-down assays and co-immunoprecipitations demonstrated that N- or C-tail mutants lacking these critical assembly domains were unable to interact with tails of TRPV5. In conclusion, two domains in the N-tail (residues 64–77) and C-tail (residues 596–601) of TRPV5 are important for channel subunit assembly, subsequent trafficking of the TRPV5 channel complex to the plasma membrane, and channel activity.

The TRP family consists of a diverse group of non-voltage-gated cation channels, including TRPC (canonical), TRPM (melastatin), and TRPV (vanilloid) subfamilies, which varies significantly in their selectivity and mode of activation (5Clapham D.E. Nature. 2003; 426: 517-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (2081) Google Scholar). The understanding of the function, gating, regulation, and structure assembly of the TRP family is developing rapidly. Initially, it was demonstrated that the Drosophila TRP and TRPL members form heteromultimeric channels associated in a supramolecular signaling complex with specific receptors and regulators (6Bahner M.

Moreover, it has been identified that there are many channel compositions within the TRPC family, e.g. TRPC1/3, TRPC1/5, TRPC4/5, and TRPC3/6/7 (7Lintschinger B. Balzer-Geldsetzer M. Baskaran T.

Within the TRPV family, the oligomeric structure of TRPV1 was studied by biochemical cross-linking, and the predominant existence of tetramers was suggested (10Kedei N. Szabo T. Lile J.D.

More recently, it has been reported that TRPV5 and TRPV6 form homoor heterotetramers in order to generate a pleiotropic set of functional channels with different Ca2+ transport (11Muller D.

However, detailed sequence comparison of the N- and C-tails of the TRPV5 and TRPV6 channels reveals significant differences, which may account for the unique electrophysiological properties including differences of inactivation, kinetic properties, and affinity for the blocker ruthenium red between these two homologous channels (22Hoenderop J.G.

A considerable amount of information in channel subunit assembly has been accumulated by studies on voltage-gated K+ (Kv) channels that are structurally related to the TRP channels. Previous studies indicated that the subfamily of Shaker-related Kv channels possesses a T1 domain in the N-tail, which confers subfamily specificity and inter-subunit assembly (23Lu J. Robinson J.M. Edwards D. Deutsch C. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 10934-10946Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). This highly conserved T1 domain has been shown to spontaneously form tetramers in the absence of transmembrane consequences (24Shen N.V. Pfaffinger P.J.

Nature. 1998; 392: 945-948Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). Crystallization of this domain further verified the reported biochemical and functional data and implicated that T1 is also involved in channel gating (25Kreusch A. Pfaffinger P.J. Stevens C.F.

Because TRPV5 shares common structural features with Kv channels, we hypothesized that there is at least one assembly signal within this channel. The aim of the present study was to identify the regions in TRPV5 involved in channel assembly. By using different experimental approaches, including pull-down, co-immunoprecipitation, patch clamp, and immunocytochemical analysis, two critical domains in the N-tail and C-tail were identified to be involved in TRPV5 channel assembly and subsequent trafficking to the plasma membrane. DNA Constructs and cRNA Synthesis—The N- and C-tails of TRPV5 were amplified and tagged with an HA or FLAG tag, respectively, by the use of PCR on the full-length cDNA of TRPV5, and were subsequently cloned into the pGEX 6p-2 (Amersham Biosciences) vector and the pT7Ts Xenopus laevis oocytes expression vector (27Steinmeyer K.

TRPV5 truncated proteins in which the N-tail (TRPV5ΔN), C-tail (TRPV5ΔC), or both tails (TRPV5ΔNΔC) were deleted were obtained by PCR and cloned into the pCINeo/IRES-GFP vector and subcloned into the pT7Ts vector (21van de Graaf S.F.

Deletion mutants of the assembly domain in the N-tail (deleted amino acids 64–76) or the C-tail (deleted amino acids 595–600) were obtained by in vitro mutagenesis and subcloned into the PT7Ts vector.

All constructs were verified by sequence analysis. Electrophysiology—The full-length cDNA encoding wild-type TRPV5, TRPV5ΔN, TRPV5ΔC, and TRPV5ΔNΔC were transfected in HEK293 cells as described previously (22Hoenderop J.G. Vennekens R. Muller D.

Currents using the whole-cell configuration were measured with an EPC-9 (HEKA Elektronik, Lambrecht, Germany; 8-pole Bessel filter, 10 kHz). Electrode resistances were between 2 and 5 megohms; capacitance and series resistance were compensated, and access resistance was monitored continuously. The step protocol consisted of 3-s voltage steps to –100 mV from a holding potential of +70 mV. The standard extracellular solution contained 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm CaCl2, 6 mm CsCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 10 mm glucose, and 10 mm HEPES/CsOH (pH 7.4). Monovalent cation currents were measured in nominally Ca2+- and Mg2+-free solution (free Ca2+ concentration is 10 nm), and Ca2+ currents in 1 mm CaCl2 but Mg2+-free solutions. Monovalent cation currents were inhibited by replacing 150 mm NaCl with an equimolar amount of N-methyl-d-glucamine-Cl. The standard internal (pipette) solution contained the following: 20 mm CsCl, 100 mm cesium aspartate, 1 mm MgCl2, 10 mm 1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid, 4 mm Na2ATP, and 10 mm HEPES/CsOH (pH 7.2). Cells were kept in a nominally Ca2+-free medium to prevent Ca2+ overload and were exposed for a maximum of 5 min to a Krebs solution containing 1.5 mm Ca2+ before sealing the patch pipette to the cell. All experiments were performed at room temperature (RT; 20–22 °C). GST Fusion Proteins and Pull-down Assay—PGEX6p-2 constructs were transformed in E. coli BL21, and GST-fused proteins were expressed and purified as described previously (21van de Graaf S.F.

Proteins of full-length TRPV5, TRPV5 N-tail, C-tail, or N- and C-tail deletion mutants were translated in vitro with [35S]methionine (ICN Biomedicals Irvine, CA) for 120 min at 30 °C using rabbit reticulocyte lysates (Promega, Madison, WI). In vitro translated proteins were added to purified GST-fused truncated proteins, immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads (Amersham Biosciences). After 2 h of incubation at RT, the beads were washed extensively with pull-down buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 140 mm NaCl, 1 mm CaCl2, 0.2% (v/v) Triton X-100, 0.2% (v/v) Nonidet P-40), and bound proteins were eluted with SDS-PAGE loading buffer and separated on SDS-polyacrylamide gels. Following electrophoresis, gels were analyzed by autoradiography (21van de Graaf S.F. Hoenderop J.G. Gkika D. Lamers D. Prenen J. Rescher U. Gerke V. Staub O. Nilius B. Bindels R.J.

To isolate total lysates, 20 oocytes were homogenized in 200 μl of homogenization buffer (HBA) (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 5 mm MgCl2, 5 mm NaH2PO4, 1 mm EDTA, 80 mm sucrose, 1 mm PMSF, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 10 μg/ml pepstatin) and centrifuged twice at 100 × g for 10 min at 4 °C to remove yolk proteins. Next the total lysates were taken up in Laemmli buffer (2 μl/oocyte) at 37 °C for 30 min (2Hoenderop J.G. van der Kemp A.W. Hartog A. van de Graaf S.F. van Os C.H. Willems P.H. Bindels R.J. J. Biol.

Immunoblot Analysis—Total lysates were subjected to SDS-PAGE (12–16% w/v) and blotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore Corp. Bedford, MA). Blots were incubated with 5% (w/v) non-fat dried milk (NFDM) in TBS-T (Tris-buffered saline (pH 7.4) containing 0.2% (v/v) Tween 20). Immunoblots were incubated overnight at 4 °C with mouse anti-HA (1:4000) or mouse anti-FLAG (1:8000) antibodies (Sigma), in 1 or 5% (w/v) NFDM in TBS-T, respectively. After washing, immunoblots were incubated at RT with the corresponding secondary antibody sheep anti-mouse IgG peroxidase (Sigma), (1:2000) in TBS-T. For co-immunoprecipitation assays, immunoblots were preincubated overnight at 4 °C with mouse anti-FLAG peroxidase-coupled antibody (1:2000) (Sigma), 5% (w/v) NFDM in TBS-T. Immunopositive bands were visualized by using an enhanced chemiluminescence system (Pierce). Co-immunoprecipitation—Twenty-microliter equivalents of protein A-coupled agarose beads (Amersham Biosciences) were preincubated for 3 h at RT with 2 μl of monoclonal anti-HA antibody (Sigma) in 0.7 ml of IPP500 (500 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris (pH 8.0), 0.1%(v/v) Nonidet P-40, 0.1%(v/v) Tween 20, 1 mm PMSF, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml pepstatin) and 0.1%(w/v) bovine serum albumin. The beads were washed three times with IPP100 (100 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris (pH 8.0), 0.1% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, 0.1% (v/v) Tween 20, 1 mm PMSF, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml pepstatin). Thirty oocytes were co-injected (each 12.5 ng) with HA- and FLAG-tagged TRPV5 N-tail or C-tail cRNA or cRNA transcribed from the deletion mutants. Oocytes were subsequently homogenized with 150 μl of solubilization buffer (20 mm Tris (pH 8.0), 10% (v/v) glycerol, 5 mm EDTA, 0.5% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, 1 mm PMSF, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml pepstatin) and incubated on ice for 1 h and centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C. The solubilized proteins were added to antibody-bound beads in sucrose buffer (100 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris (pH 8.0), 5 mm EDTA, 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100, 10% (w/v) sucrose, 1 mm PMSF, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml pepstatin) and incubated overnight at 4 °C. Subsequently, the beads were washed with IPP100, and proteins were eluted in Laemmli as described previously (29Kamsteeg E.J. Wormhoudt T.A. Rijss J.P. van Os C.H. Deen P.M. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2394-2400Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Immunocytochemistry—X. laevis oocytes were injected with 5 ng of cRNA of HA-tagged TRPV5 or co-injected with 5 ng of cRNA of HA-tagged TRPV5 and 10 ng of nontagged TRPV5 mutants (TRPV5ΔC, TRPV5ΔN, and TRPV5ΔNΔC), respectively. Immunocytochemistry was performed as described previously (30Mulders S.M. Rijss J.P. Hartog A. Bindels R.J. van Os C.H. Deen P.M. Am. J.

Ca2+ uptake was determined 2 days after injection as described previously (2Hoenderop J.G. van der Kemp A.W. Hartog A. van de Graaf S.F. van Os C.H. Willems P.H. Bindels R.J. J. Biol.

Plasma Membrane Isolation—X. laevis oocytes were injected with 5 ng of HA-TRPV5 cRNA only or co-injected with 5 ng of HA-TRPV5 and 10 ng of TRPV5 truncated cRNA (TRPV5ΔC, TRPV5ΔN, or TRPV5ΔNΔC). After 48 h follicle membranes were manually removed, and 12 oocytes were incubated in MBSS (20 mm MES, 80 mm NaCl, pH 6.0, containing 1% (v/v) positively charged colloidal silica (Ludox Cl, Aldrich, Bornem, Belgium)) at 4 °C for 30 min (29Kamsteeg E.J. Wormhoudt T.A. Rijss J.P. van Os C.H. Deen P.M. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2394-2400Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Subsequently, oocytes were washed twice in MBSS and incubated with 0.1% (v/v) sodium polyacrylic acid (Aldrich) in MBSS at 4 °C for 30 min. Oocytes were homogenized in HBA buffer, and plasma membranes were isolated by serial centrifugation four times at 13.5 × g, two times at 24 × g, and two times at 38 × g. One-ml supernatant was exchanged with HBA buffer after each centrifugation step. Finally, membranes were pelleted at 16,000 × g for 30 min, dissolved in SDS sample buffer, and analyzed by immunoblotting. Pull-down Assay of N-tail and C-tail of TRPV5—The role of TRPV5 N-tail and C-tail in the channel assembly was initially examined using pull-down assays. TRPV5 N-tail and C-tail were expressed as GST fusion proteins and subsequently tested for their interaction with in vitro translated full-length TRPV5 or the TRPV5 N-tail and C-tail. As depicted in Fig. 1A, the GST-fused N-tail and C-tail associated with in vitro translated [35S]methionine-TRPV5. Moreover, pull-down analysis demonstrated N-tail-N-tail (Fig. 1B) and C-tail-C-tail interactions (Fig. 1C). To investigate whether the N-tail preferentially interacts with the N- or C-tail, the GST-N-tail was incubated with in vitro translated N- and C-tail simultaneously. This pull-down experiment indicated that the GST-N-tail preferentially binds the in vitro translated N-tail (Fig. 1D). All interactions were specific, as no interaction with GST alone was observed. Co-immunoprecipitation of N-tail and C-tail of TRPV5—The findings from the pull-down experiments suggested that the N-tail and C-tail of TRPV5 contributed to channel assembly. Therefore, we tested whether the N-tail and C-tail of TRPV5 can be co-immunoprecipitated. First, immunoblot analysis confirmed expression of both tails that were specifically detected by the applied anti-HA or anti-FLAG antibody, respectively. The anti-HA antibody specifically detected the HA-N-tail in total lysates from oocytes co-expressing HA-N-tail and FLAG-C-tail, whereas anti-FLAG antibody only recognized the FLAG-C-tail (Fig. 2A). The HA- and FLAG-tagged N-tails (Fig. 2B), HA- and FLAG-tagged C-tails (Fig. 2C), or HA-N-tail with FLAG-C-tail of TRPV5 (Fig. 2D) were co-expressed and subsequently immunoprecipitated using the anti-HA antibody. Immunoblots containing the immune complexes were probed with the anti-FLAG antibody. Most interestingly, Fig. 2 showed that FLAG-tagged N-tail or C-tail was co-immunoprecipitated with the HA-tagged N-tail or C-tail of TRPV5, demonstrating N-N, C-C, and N-C interactions in a TRPV5 channel complex. Functional Analysis of TRPV5 Channel Assembly—To further elucidate the functional consequences of the observed interactions between N-N tail, N-C tail, and C-C tail, the effect of co-expressing TRPV5 wild-type and truncated proteins (TRPV5ΔN, TRPV5ΔC, or TRPV5ΔNΔC) on TRPV5 activity at the plasma membrane was determined in X. laevis oocytes and HEK293 cells. First, oocytes were injected with HA-TRPV5 only or co-injected with TRPV5ΔN, TRPV5ΔC, or TRPV5ΔNΔC cRNA. Expression of TRPV5 resulted in ∼3.5-fold increase of 45Ca2+ influx compared with noninjected oocytes (Fig. 3A). Co-expression of TRPV5ΔN significantly decreased the TRPV5-mediated Ca2+ influx compared with TRPV5 alone, whereas co-expression of TRPV5ΔC completely inhibited Ca2+ influx to a level that was indistinguishable from noninjected oocytes. In contrast, co-expression of TRPV5ΔNΔC had no significant effect on TRPV5 channel activity (Fig. 3A). 45Ca2+ uptake in oocytes expressing only TRPV5ΔN, TRPV5ΔC, or TRPV5ΔNΔC was not different from noninjected oocytes (data not shown). Second, patch clamp analysis was performed to investigate the electrophysiological properties of channel complexes consisting of wild-type and TRPV5 truncated proteins. Truncated channels, including TRPV5ΔN, TRPV5ΔC, and TRPV5ΔNΔC, were (co)expressed with wild-type TRPV5 in HEK293 cells. As shown in Fig. 3B, HEK293 cells expressing TRPV5ΔN, TRPV5ΔC or TRPV5ΔNΔC did not yield any Na+ currents and were not different from nontransfected cells (data not shown). Remarkably, HEK293 cells co-expressing wild-type TRPV5 and TRPV5ΔN or TRPV5ΔC displayed significantly reduced Na+ currents compared with wild-type TRPV5 alone. Inversely, Na+ currents measured in HEK293 cells co-expressing wild-type TRPV5 and TRPV5ΔNΔC were not significantly affected, indicating that it is unlikely that the transmembrane domains of TRPV5 are critical determinants for subunit assembly. TRPV5 Routing Is Disturbed by Mutant Channel Assembly—In order to understand the molecular mechanism underlying the dominant-negative effect of TRPV5 truncated proteins (TRPV5ΔN and TRPV5ΔC) on wild-type TRPV5 channel activity, a biochemical and immunocytochemical approach was combined. The expression of HA-TRPV5 was determined by analyzing plasma membrane and total membrane fractions of oocytes expressing TRPV5 alone or in combination with the truncated proteins. A distinct band at a molecular mass of ∼85 kDa corresponding to the glycosylated form of TRPV5 was observed in plasma membrane fractions of TRPV5-expressing oocytes (Fig. 3C). Most importantly, wild-type TRPV5 expression was significantly reduced or absent in plasma membrane fractions of oocytes co-expressing TRPV5ΔN or TRPV5ΔC, respectively. However, co-injection of TRPV5ΔNΔC had no effect on the plasma membrane localization of TRPV5 (Fig. 3C). Most importantly, total membrane fractions showed that TRPV5 was expressed to a similar extent in the absence and presence of the TRPV5 truncated proteins (Fig. 3D). These results were verified by immunocytochemistry to detect TRPV5 localization on the plasma membrane. In contrast to noninjected oocytes (Fig. 4A), wild-type TRPV5 cRNA-injected oocytes displayed a strong immunopositive labeling along the plasma membrane, whereas the cytoplasm was only faintly stained (Fig. 4B). Most importantly, plasma membrane staining of TRPV5 was significantly decreased in oocytes co-expressing HA-TRPV5 and TRPV5ΔN and to a lesser extent HA-TRPV5 and TRPV5ΔC (Fig. 4, D and E). A strong immunopositive staining was, however, present along the plasma membrane of oocytes co-injected with HA-TRPV5 and TRPV5ΔNΔC (Fig. 4C). The localization of TRPV5 in the presence of TRPV5ΔN or TRPV5ΔC was predominantly intracellular. Together, these results indicated that the trafficking of HA-TRPV5 from cytosol toward the plasma membrane was disturbed by assembly with TRPV5ΔN or TRPV5ΔC, but not with TRPV5ΔNΔC, explaining the reduced channel activity.

StAR acts exclusively on the outer mitochondrial membrane (OMM) by unknown mechanisms. To identify StAR domains involved in membrane association, we reacted N-62 StAR with small unilamellar vesicles (SUVs) composed of lipids resembling the OMM. Solvent-exposed domains were digested with trypsin, Asp-N, or pepsin at different pH levels, and StAR peptides protected from proteolysis were identified by mass spectrometry.

Computer-graphic modeling of N-62 StAR indicated these peptides correspond to the C-terminal α4 helix and that residues Leu275, Thr263, and Arg272 in α4 form stabilizing interactions with Gln128, Asp150, and Asp106 in adjacent loops. CD spectroscopy of a 37-mer model of α4 (residues 247–287) indicated a random coil in aqueous buffer, but in 40% methanol the peptide was α-helical and achieved maximal α-helicity at pH 5.0 in the presence of SUVs. Reacting the 37-mer with diethyl pyrocarbamate incorporated into SUVs increased the number of modified residues. Thus the C-terminal α4 helix is critically involved in the membrane association of StAR with OMM lipids. The membrane association and the α-helical structure of the C terminus in the presence of OMM lipids are also pH-dependent.

Clark B.J. Endocr. Rev. 1996; 17: 221-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (943) Google Scholar, 2Miller W.L. Strauss J.F. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1999; 69: 131-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Full-length StAR is expressed as a 285-residue protein with a molecular mass of 37 kDa having a mitochondrial leader sequence that is cleaved to yield a 30-kDa protein upon entering the mitochondria (3Clark B.J. Wells J. King S.R. Stocco D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28314-28322Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 4Lin D. Sugawara T. Strauss J.F. Clark B.J. Stocco D.M. Saenger P. Rogol A. Miller W.L. Science. 1995; 267: 1828-1831Crossref PubMed Scopus (874) Google Scholar). Deletion of 62 N-terminal residues (N-62 StAR) yields a protein that remains in the cytoplasm yet retains full biologic activity (5Arakane F. Sugawara T. Nishino H. Liu Z. Holt J.A. Pain D. Stocco D.M. Miller W.L. Strauss J.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 13731-13736Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). The mechanism by which StAR facilitates mitochondrial cholesterol import is not known. However, several lines of evidence indicate that StAR acts primarily and probably exclusively on or in the OMM (2Miller W.L. Strauss J.F. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1999; 69: 131-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). First, N-62 StAR remains in the cytoplasm, but is fully active (5Arakane F. Sugawara T. Nishino H. Liu Z. Holt J.A. Pain D. Stocco D.M. Miller W.L. Strauss J.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 13731-13736Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). Second, bacterially expressed human N-62 StAR is active on isolated mitochondria in vitro (6Arakane F. Kallen C.B. Watari H. Foster J.A. Sepuri N.B. Pain D. Stayrook S.E. Lewis M. Gerton G.L.

Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 11722-11731Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Third, cytoplasmic N-62 StAR can transfer cholesterol to other membranes, such as the endoplasmic reticulum (8Kallen C.B. Billheimer J.T. Summers S.A. Stayrook S.E. Lewis M. Strauss 3rd, J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26285-26288Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar), and can transfer cholesterol between synthetic unilamellar vesicles in vitro (9Tuckey R.C. Headlam M.J. Bose H.S. Miller W.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 47123-47128Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Fourth, StAR is inactive in the mitochondrial intramembranous space or when immobilized on the IMM, but manipulating the StAR leader to slow its mitochondrial entry or to immobilize StAR on the OMM shows that the activity of StAR is proportional to its residency time on the OMM (10Bose H.S. Lingappa V.R. Miller W.L. Nature. 2002; 417: 87-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). These data are consistent with data indicating that a tightly packed, protease-resistant N-terminal region (residues 63–188) of StAR slows its mitochondrial import to keep StAR on the OMM where it is biologically active (11Bose H.S. Whittal R.M. Baldwin M.A. Miller W.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 7250-7255Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). Although a crystal structure of StAR has not been determined, the crystal structures of the StAR-related lipid transfer domains of two closely related proteins, N-216 MLN64 (12Tsujishita Y. Hurley J.H. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 408-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar) and StarD4 (13Romanowski M.J. Soccio R.E. Breslow J.L. Burley S.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 6949-6954Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar), have been solved to 2.2-Å resolution. Both of these structures show an α/β-helix grip fold and an elongated hydrophobic pocket that can accommodate one molecule of cholesterol. N-216 MLN64 has about 50% of the activity of StAR to promote steroidogenesis in transfected cell systems (7Bose H.S. Whittal R.M. Huang M.C. Baldwin M.A. Miller W.L. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 11722-11731Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 14Watari H. Arakane F. Moog-Lutz C. Kallen C.B. Tomasetto C. Gerton G.L. Rio M.C. Baker M.E. Strauss 3rd, J.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 8462-8467Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar), and both spectroscopic data and the results of proteolytic cleavage indicate it is folded similarly to StAR (7Bose H.S. Whittal R.M. Huang M.C. Baldwin M.A. Miller W.L. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 11722-11731Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Both N-216 MLN64 and StarD4 have the same fold (12Tsujishita Y. Hurley J.H. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 408-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar, 13Romanowski M.J. Soccio R.E. Breslow J.L. Burley S.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 6949-6954Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar); homology modeling indicates that hamster StAR also shares this fold (15Mathieu A.P. Fleury A. Ducharme L. Lavigne P. LeHoux J.G. J. Mol. Endocrinol. 2002; 29: 327-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Thus there is substantial information about the probable three-dimensional structure of StAR. Biophysical studies of N-62 StAR in solution and in association with membranes show that it exhibits pH-dependent molten globule properties (11Bose H.S. Whittal R.M. Baldwin M.A. Miller W.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 7250-7255Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar, 16Christensen K. Bose H.S. Harris F.M. Miller W.L. Bell J.D. J. Biol.

J. 2001; 356: 151-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). This might expose a cholesterol binding pocket, allowing this intermediate structure to deliver cholesterol from the OMM to the IMM (11Bose H.S. Whittal R.M. Baldwin M.A. Miller W.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 7250-7255Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). The C terminus appears to contain biologically relevant domains, because all mis-sense mutations in StAR resulting in congenital lipoid adrenal hyperplasia are located in the C-terminal 40% of the protein (4Lin D. Sugawara T. Strauss J.F. Clark B.J. Stocco D.M. Saenger P. Rogol A. Miller W.L. Science. 1995; 267: 1828-1831Crossref PubMed Scopus (874) Google Scholar, 18Bose H.S. Sugawara T. Strauss 3rd, J.F.

Furthermore, deletion of ten C-terminal residues reduces activity by 70% (5Arakane F. Sugawara T. Nishino H. Liu Z. Holt J.A. Pain D. Stocco D.M. Miller W.L. Strauss J.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 13731-13736Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar), and deletion of 28 C-terminal residues ablates all activity (4Lin D. Sugawara T. Strauss J.F. Clark B.J. Stocco D.M. Saenger P. Rogol A. Miller W.L. Science. 1995; 267: 1828-1831Crossref PubMed Scopus (874) Google Scholar, 5Arakane F. Sugawara T. Nishino H. Liu Z. Holt J.A. Pain D. Stocco D.M. Miller W.L. Strauss J.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 13731-13736Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). Structural analysis indicates that the C-terminal 28 residues of StAR form an α-helix (Fig. 1). We hypothesize that this helix, which in StAR is essential to maintain steroidogenic activity, could hinge out to interact with lipid membranes. If inserted into the membrane, it might induce conformational changes to open the binding pocket and release cholesterol into the membrane. StAR activity is maintained when OMM proteins have been denatured with heat or proteolyzed with trypsin (8Kallen C.B. Billheimer J.T. Summers S.A. Stayrook S.E. Lewis M. Strauss 3rd, J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26285-26288Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar), and N-62 StAR interacts in a pH-dependent manner with synthetic lipid membranes (16Christensen K. Bose H.S. Harris F.M. Miller W.L. Bell J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 17044-17051Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), both suggesting that StAR interacts with phospholipid membranes. Despite the available structural and biologic data, the orientation of StAR with respect to the OMM and the identities of the domains that interact with the OMM are unknown. Such information should facilitate understanding of the mechanism of action of StAR. We used mass spectrometric analysis of StAR peptides protected from proteolysis by synthetic lipid models of the OMM to show that the C-terminal α4 helix is the principal region of StAR that interacts with the OMM. Similar experiments plus spectroscopic studies using a 37-amino acid model of the C-terminal domain of StAR confirm pH-dependent interactions with lipid membranes. Reagents—Wild type His6-N-62 StAR protein was expressed in Escherichia coli and purified as described previously (20Bose H.S. Baldwin M.A. Miller W.L. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 9768-9775Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Egg phosphatidylcholine (EPC), tetraoleoylcardiolipin (CL), egg phosphatidylethanolamine, egg sphingomyelin (SM), and bovine brain phosphatidylinositol were obtained from Avanti Polar Lipids (Birmingham, AL). Pepsin (immobilized on agarose beads) was from Pierce, and trypsin (porcine, sequencing grade-modified) was from Promega (Madison, WI). Sodium chloride, sodium phosphate, and diethyl pyrocarbamate (DEPC) were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich, and OPTIMA grade methanol was from Fisher (Fairlawn, NJ). All other reagents were from commercially available sources and of the highest purity. Liposome Preparation—Lipid standards dissolved in chloroform were mixed to prepare vesicles composed of EPC, phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylinositol, SM, and CL (51:26:11:4:3) to model the outer mitochondrial membrane (OMM) (21de Kroon A.I. Dolis D. Mayer A. Lill R. de Kruijff B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1325: 108-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Some samples also contained 5 parts of cholesterol. The chloroform was evaporated to dryness with N2 gas, and the dried lipid residue was hydrated with 20 mm buffer (sodium citrate at pH 4.0 or sodium acetate at pH 6.5) plus 150 mm potassium chloride for 1 h at 37 °C with 30 s vortex mixing every 10 min to yield multilamellar vesicles. SUVs (100–200 Å) were prepared at ambient temperature using a probe sonicator pulsed three times for 3 min each (16Christensen K. Bose H.S. Harris F.M. Miller W.L. Bell J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 17044-17051Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Multilamellar vesicles composed of 82 mol% EPC and 18 mol% CL were prepared in pH 4.0, 20 mm sodium citrate buffer containing 150 mm KCl as above (16Christensen K. Bose H.S. Harris F.M. Miller W.L. Bell J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 17044-17051Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). SUVs were generated by equilibrating the lipid solution with an extrusion apparatus (Avanti Polar Lipids, part number 610000) at 37 °C for 10 min and passing the solution through a 0.1-μm polycarbonate membrane 21 times (22Subbarao N.K. MacDonald R.I. Takeshita K. MacDonald R.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1063: 147-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 23MacDonald R.C. MacDonald R.I. Menco B.P. Takeshita K. Subbarao N.K. Hu L.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1061: 297-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (1389) Google Scholar). An average particle size of 100 Å was confirmed by dynamic light scattering, and vesicles were used within 24 h of preparation. Liposome Protection—Bacterially expressed human N-62 StAR (0.34 μm in 50-μl total volume) was reacted at either pH 4.0 or 6.5 in the absence or the presence of SUVs (0.9 mm total lipid concentration) in 20 mm buffer (sodium citrate at pH 4.0 or sodium acetate at pH 6.5) plus 150 mm potassium chloride. The samples were incubated at 37 °C for 10 min then reacted with either 5 μl of immobilized pepsin (30 min, pH 4.0) or 0.02 mg/ml trypsin (10 min, pH 6.5) at 25 °C to digest the solvent-exposed regions of the protein. Three parts chloroform:methanol:water (1:2:1) were added, and the organic and aqueous phases were separated by centrifugation. The aqueous extracts (upper layer) were retained and stored frozen. Subsequently, they were evaporated nearly to dryness in a SpeedVac and dissolved in 10 μl of 0.1% formic acid. Peptide Limited Proteolysis—A synthetic 37-mer peptide corresponding to residues 247–284 of human StAR (excluding the C-terminal cysteine) was prepared by Dr. Hayden Ball (Protein Chemistry Technology Center, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, TX). The peptide was purified by HPLC, the molecular weight was confirmed by electrospray mass spectrometry, and the sample was lyophilized. The 37-mer (20 nmol/μl) was incubated at room temperature for 10 min in 200 μl of 20 mm phosphate buffer, pH 6.5, without or with SUVs composed of EPC:CL (82:12) at a total lipid concentration of 50 μm. The sample was incubated with DEPC (0.1%, v/v) for 15 min at 25 °C. The peptides were isolated from the reaction mixture by zip-tip extraction/adsorption onto a pre-conditioned Millipore μC18 zip-tip (Millipore, Milford, MA) following the manufacturer's instructions. The eluate was evaporated nearly to dryness in a SpeedVac; the peptide extracts were dissolved in 50 μl of 25 mm ammonium bicarbonate buffer, pH 8.5, and digested with 12 mm Asp-N for 3 h. This cleaves the 37-mer between residues 18 and 19, simplifying the MS analysis. The sample was de-salted using a Millipore μC18 zip-tip as above, and the final eluate was evaporated nearly to dryness and dissolved to 50 μl with 0.1% formic acid in water:acetonitrile (75:25). A 0.5-μl aliquot of the extract was mixed with 0.5 μl of saturated dihydroxy benzoic acid prepared in water, and the entire sample was transferred onto a stainless steel MALDI target for cocrystallization (ABI, Foster City, CA). The 37-mer peptide fragments were analyzed by MALDI MS. Analysis of N-62 StAR Plus Pepsin Digestion at pH 4.0—Prior to MS analysis, Millipore μC18 zip-tips were used to remove impurities. Each eluate was evaporated nearly to dryness, and the samples were dissolved to 10 μl with 0.1% formic acid. The peptide mixture from the pepsin digest (1 μl) was manually injected with a Hamilton syringe, and an LC-Packings Ultimate HPLC (LC-Packings, South San Francisco, CA) was used for solvent delivery. The samples were loaded onto a 75 μm × 15 cm, 5-μm particle size C-18 column (LC-Packings) and eluted with 0.1% formic acid in a 30-min linear gradient of 5–60% acetonitrile in water flowing at 5 μl/min. The effluent was routed into a Sciex-QSTAR (o)-TOF MS (ABI, Foster City, CA) operated in electrospray positive mode. The MS acquisition was run in information-dependent acquisition mode scanning from 305 to 1400 m/z, Q1 resolution set to low, collision energy 25 V, and the TOF m/z range was 50–2000 for MS/MS acquisition. Analysis N-62 StAR Plus Trypsin Digestion at pH 6.5—The peptide mixture (5 μl) was injected onto a 0.5- × 2.0-mm CapTrap (LC-Packings) load column using an Ultimate HPLC with a FAMOS autosampler (LC-Packings) and washed for 5 min with 0.1% formic acid water/5% acetonitrile flowing at 40 μl/min. The sample was eluted onto a 75 μm × 15 cm, 5-μm particle size C-18 column (LC-Packings) and eluted with 0.1% formic acid in a 30-min linear gradient of 5–60% acetonitrile in water flowing 300 nl/min. The column effluent was mixed 1:1 with α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid that was previously dissolved in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in 70% methanol and spotted for 30 s (∼150 nl of sample/spot) onto a 100-well stainless steel MALDI target using a Probot (LC-Packings). MALDI-MS/MS analysis was performed on an ABI 4700 Proteomics Analyzer operated in the positive ion mode. MS/MS data were collected on all molecular ions having a signal-to-noise ratio of >15. Homology Modeling of Human StAR—The sequence of human N-62 StAR (24Sugawara T. Lin D. Holt J.A. Martin K.O. Javitt N.B. Miller W.L. Strauss 3rd, J.F. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 12506-12512Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar) was aligned with the sequence of human N-216 MLN64 (12Tsujishita Y. Hurley J.H. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 408-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar) using the program Swiss-PDB Deep View (version 3.7). The resulting alignment was examined manually and was submitted for automatic modeling using the human N-216 MLN64 template PDB ID: 1EM2 (12Tsujishita Y. Hurley J.H. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 408-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar) on the Swiss-Model server (www.expasy.ch/spdbv/). The potential energy of the initial StAR model was minimized using the Amber7 program (force field ff99) at the Computer Graphics Laboratory at University of California at San Francisco. Energy minimization was performed with 250 steps of steepness plus 750 steps of conjugate gradient. The free energy of the structure reached the local minima after the run. The resulting model was checked using the program What If (www.cmbi.kun.nl.gv.servers/WIWWWI/), and the Ramachandran plots were calculated with the Swiss-PDB viewer 3.7 program. CD Spectroscopy—Far-UV (200–260 nm) CD measurements were performed in a 0.1-mm path length flat cuvette in a Jasco 720 spectropolarimeter equipped with a Peltier temperature controller. The 37-mer (20 nmol) was mixed with varying concentrations of methanol at pH 7.0, with buffers of varying pH with or without 50 μm lipid (82:18, EPC:CL). The pH 2 and pH 7 buffers were 4 mm phosphate, and pH 3–6 buffers were 4 mm citrate. Each preparation was incubated at room temperature for 5 min before the measurement, and the sample holder was maintained at 23 °C. Each spectrum represents the average of at least four accumulations with subtraction of the appropriate background. Each experiment was repeated three times, and the spectra from each experiment were averaged. The secondary structure analysis was performed using CDPro analysis tool SELCON3 (25Sreerama N. Venyaminov S.Y. Woody R.W. Protein Sci. 1999; 8: 370-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (643) Google Scholar). Modification with Diethyl Pyrocarbamate—DEPC was prepared at 5% in 1:1 methanol:water and vortexed to dissolve the DEPC completely. The 37-mer (20 nmol/μl) was mixed without or with 50 μl of 82:18 EPC:CL SUVs in 20 mm phosphate buffer, pH 6.5, incubated at 23 °C for 5 min, reacted twice with 5 μl of 5% DEPC (final concentration 0.1%) for 15 min at 25 °C, and the reaction was quenched with 1 μl of 1mm imidazole. The peptide was extracted from the solution by adsorption onto a Millipore μC18 zip-tip following the manufacturer's instructions for conditioning and washing. The peptide was eluted with 20 μl of 70% acetonitrile and evaporated to ∼2 μl in a SpeedVac. The peptide was reacted with 10 μl of 12 ng/ml endoproteinase Asp-N prepared in 25 mm ammonium bicarbonate buffer (pH 8) for 4 h, after which the peptide was extracted with a Millipore μC18 zip-tip as described above. The sample was dissolved in 50 μl of 10% acetonitrile from which 0.5 μl was mixed with 0.5 μl of a saturated solution of 2,5-dihydroxy benzoic acid prepared in water, and the entire mixture was spotted on a MALDI target for MALDI-TOF analysis. Interaction of N-62 StAR with Lipid Membranes—Although it is now clear that StAR acts on or in the OMM (10Bose H.S. Lingappa V.R. Miller W.L. Nature. 2002; 417: 87-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar), it is not clear to what extent StAR becomes associated with the OMM, or which domains of the StAR protein interact with the OMM. To answer these questions, we designed “liposome protection” experiments. Purified, bacterially expressed human N-62 StAR was mixed with small unilamellar vesicles (SUVs) composed of 51% egg phosphatidylcholine (EPC), 26% phosphatidylethanolamine, 11% phosphatidylinositol, 4% sphingomyelin (SM), and 3% cardiolipin (CL), a lipid mixture designed to approximate the composition of liver OMM (21de Kroon A.I. Dolis D. Mayer A. Lill R. de Kruijff B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1325: 108-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar) or with SUVs of the same composition containing 5% cholesterol. The domains of StAR exposed to solvent were then digested with a proteolytic enzyme, and the membrane-associated, liposome-protected domains were identified by comparing the pattern of the resulting peptides with the pattern obtained under the same conditions, but in the absence of SUVs. When N-62 StAR was digested with pepsin at pH 4.0, and the peptides identified in the presence and absence of lipids were similar except for a peptide of mass 2761.50, which was unique to the experiment conducted in the presence of lipids (Table I). The MS/MS spectrum of this peptide allowed us to decipher its sequence unambiguously, confirming that it comprises StAR residues 259–283 (Fig. 2). Similarly, when N-62 StAR was digested with trypsin at pH 6.5, equivalent peptides were identified in the presence and absence of lipids except for the C terminus of the protein (Table II). By contrast to the results at pH 4.0, the C terminus of the protein was not completely protected from enzymatic digestion but was partially protected at pH 6.5. The presence or absence of cholesterol in the SUVs had no effect on the protection at pH 6.5. The sequence RKR (residues 272–274 in the center of the C-terminal α4 helix) acted as an indicator for the efficiency of tryptic digestion. In the absence of lipids, proteolysis was complete, giving the tryptic peptide 254–272, whereas the presence of lipids reduced the degree of proteolysis, resulting in multiple tryptic peptides comprising residues 254–272, 254–273, and 254–274. Although there may be differences in the efficiencies of the enzyme digestions under the two sets of conditions employed, these observations suggest complete protection at pH 4.0 and limited protection at pH 6.5. The clear reduction in the proteolysis of the C terminus of StAR at both pH 4.0 and 6.5 in the presence of lipids compared with the reactions without lipids suggests that the C-terminal helix is absorbed into the lipid membrane at the lower pH. These effects on the C terminus were the only marked difference between digestion in the presence and absence of lipids (Fig. 3).Table IHPLC/MS/MS of N-62 StAR digested with pepsin at pH 4.0 in the presence and absence of mitochondrial lipidsMolecular massIntensityaMS/MS peak intensity: blank cell = not detected, w = weak, m = medium, and s = strong.ResiduesPeptide sequence689.36mbWithout lipids.179-184VGPRDF814.49mbWithout lipids.248-254KGWLPKS930.54mcOMM lipids.244-251SIDLKGWL939.60w/mbWithout lipids.111-119KVVPDVGKV943.57sbWithout lipids., scOMM lipids.82-90AMQKALGIL1026.64mbWithout lipids.110-119SKVVPDVGKV1043.63mcOMM lipids.243-251LSIDLKGWL1154.70sbWithout lipids., scOMM lipids.248-257KGWLPKSIIN1155.70mbWithout lipids., scOMM lipids.245-254IDLKGWLPKS1202.56mbWithout lipids.144-153MGEWNPNVKE1242.73w/mbWithout lipids., mcOMM lipids.244-254SIDLKGWLPKS1282.77vsbWithout lipids., vscOMM lipids.248-258KGWLPKSIINQ1313.69m/sbWithout lipids., m/scOMM lipids.123-133EVVVDQPMERL1355.86sbWithout lipids., vscOMM lipids.111-122KVVPDVGKVFRL1388.86vsbWithout lipids., scOMM lipids.154-165IKVLQKIGKDTF1446.89vsbWithout lipids.226-239VLHPLAGSPSKTKL1577.93vsbWithout lipids.225-239MVLHPLAGSPSKTKL1624.00mbWithout lipids., scOMM lipids.245-258IDLKGWLPKSIINQ1696.04mbWithout lipids., m/scOMM lipids.243-257LSIDLKGWLPKSIIN1711.00m/sbWithout lipids., scOMM lipids.244-258SIDLKGWLPKSIINQ1790.96scOMM lipids.75-90YLQQGEEAMQKALGIL1824.08sbWithout lipids., scOMM lipids.243-258LSIDLKGWLPKSIINQ1832.97mcOMM lipids.166-183ITHELAAEAAGNLVGRPD1847.09vscOMM lipids.226-242VLHPLAGSPSKTKLTWL1862.00mbWithout lipids., scOMM lipids.74-90AYLQQGEEAMQKALGIL1869.12sbWithout lipids., mcOMM lipids.154-169IKVLQKIGKDTFITHE1917.91m/scOMM lipids.138-153VERMEAMGEWNPNVKE1978.14sbWithout lipids., m/scOMM lipids.225-242MVLHPLAGSPSKTKLTWL1980.06mbWithout lipids., w/mcOMM lipids.166-184ITHELAAEAAGNLVGRPDF2265.22m/sbWithout lipids., mcOMM lipids.166-187ITHELAAEAAGNLVGPRDFVSV2549.35w/mbWithout lipids., scOMM lipids.261-282SQTQVDFANHLRKRLESHPASE2761.50scOMM lipids.259-282VLSQTQVDFANHLRKRLESHPASEa MS/MS peak intensity: blank cell = not detected, w = weak, m = medium, and s = strong.b Without lipids.c OMM lipids.

https://openalex.org/W2066799580,"The accumulation of amyloid β (Aβ) in the walls of small vessels in the cerebral cortex is associated with diseases characterized by dementia or stroke. These include Alzheimer's disease, Down syndrome, and sporadic and hereditary cerebral amyloid angiopathies (CAAs) related to mutations within the Aβ sequence. A higher tendency of Aβ to aggregate, a defective clearance to the systemic circulation, and insufficient proteolytic removal have been proposed as mechanisms that lead to Aβ accumulation in the brain. By using immunoprecipitation and mass spectrometry, we show that insulin-degrading enzyme (IDE) from isolated human brain microvessels was capable of degrading 125I-insulin and cleaved Aβ-(1-40) wild type and the genetic variants Aβ A21G (Flemish), Aβ E22Q (Dutch), and Aβ E22K (Italian) at the predicted sites. In microvessels from Alzheimer's disease cases with CAA, IDE protein levels showed a 44% increase as determined by sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and Western blot. However, the activity of IDE upon radiolabeled insulin was significantly reduced in CAA as compared with age-matched controls. These results support the notion that a defect in Aβ proteolysis by IDE contributes to the accumulation of this peptide in the cortical microvasculature. Moreover they raise the possibility that IDE inhibition or inactivation is a pathogenic mechanism that may open novel strategies for the treatment of cerebrovascular Aβ amyloidoses.

These include Alzheimer's disease (AD), Down syndrome, and sporadic and autosomal dominant cerebral amyloid angiopathies (CAAs) (Ref. 1Glenner G.G. Wong C.W. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Res. 2002; 27: 1387-1399Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). In sporadic AD, a large proportion of the cases show Aβ-(1-40) and Aβ-(1-42/43) accumulation in the media and adventitia of brain vessels. Although the contribution of such deposits to the pathophysiology of dementia is not known, their extent and localization are strongly influenced by the apoE genotype (3Roher A.E. Lowenson J.D.

Sporadic CAA accounts for ∼5% of strokes, and in this condition, Aβ wild type (wt) is the main component of amyloid deposits (Ref. 6Yong W.H. Robert M.E. Secor D.L. Kleikamp T.J. Vinters H.V. Arch.

The Flemish (A21G), Dutch (E22Q), and Italian (E22K) genetic variants of Aβ show a remarkable tendency to accumulate in the leptomeningeal and cortical vasculature leading to fatal hemorrhagic strokes around the 5th decade of life (8Kamino K.

In addition, the Arctic (E22G) and Iowa (D23N) variants of Aβ present clinically with dementia, and yet at the pathological level they also show prominent vascular deposits (11Nilsberth C.

Interestingly the Dutch, Italian, and Iowa Aβ variants, when aggregated, are capable of inducing in vitro toxicity upon endothelial and smooth muscle cells, suggesting a pathogenic relationship between Aβ deposition, vascular pathology, and clinical manifestations (10Miravalle L.

With regard to the underlying mechanisms that result in Aβ accumulation in the vascular walls, amino acid substitutions clustered in the central region of Aβ sequence such as E22Q, E22G, and D23N may facilitate a fast rate of aggregation, possibly due to a net charge effect at physiologic pH (11Nilsberth C.

It has been postulated that such a property may be the key dominant gain of function in the pathogenesis of these diseases (16Prelli F. Levy E. van Duinen S.G. Bots G.T. Luyendijk W. Frangione B. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1990; 170: 301-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). In addition, a slower rate of reverse transport across the blood-brain barrier and perivascular drainage to the systemic circulation has been shown for the Aβ Dutch variant as compared with Aβ wt (17Monro O.R.

The possibility of a defect in Aβ degradation has recently gained experimental support as a mechanism contributing to its accumulation in the brain, particularly in the sporadic forms of Aβ-associated diseases in which Aβ wt is involved. Neprilysin (NEP), endothelin-converting enzymes (ECEs), IDE, angiotensin-converting enzyme, the plasmin system, and matrix metalloproteases among others are major proteases that may participate in the catabolic pathway of Aβ in the brain (for a review, see Ref. 2Morelli L. Llovera R. Ibendahl S. Castaño E.M. Neurochem. Res. 2002; 27: 1387-1399Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). This process has been tested recently in vivo for NEP, IDE, and ECE using loss-of-function animal models (18Iwata N. Tsubuki S. Takaki Y. Shirotani K. Lu B. Gerard N.P. Gerard C. Hama E. Lee H.J.

NEP is a membrane-bound zinc metalloprotease expressed in neurons and microvessels that shows an inverse correlation with the vulnerability to Aβ deposition in the human brain (22Yasojima K. Akiyama H. McGeer E.G. McGeer P.L. Neurosci. Lett. 2001; 297: 97-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar, 23Carpentier M. Robitaille Y. Des Groseillers L. Boileau G. Marcinkiewicz M. J. Neuropathol. Exp. Neurol. 2002; 61: 849-857Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Moreover the injection of a lentiviral vector expressing NEP in the central nervous system of transgenic mice carrying a pathogenic amyloid precursor protein (APP) human mutation resulted in a significant reduction in amyloid burden and neuronal damage (24Marr R.A.

IDE is a 110-kDa zinc- and thiol-dependent peptidase present in the cytosol and peroxisomes and on the cell surface of a wide variety of cell types including neurons (25Becker A.B. Roth R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 3835-3839Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 26Vekrellis K. Ye Z. Qiu W.Q. Walsh D. Hartley D. Chesneau V. Rosner M.R. Selkoe D.J. J.

Neurosci. 2001; 21: 2561-2570Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Because of its Km for insulin in the nanomolar range, IDE is involved in the degradation of this hormone in vivo (28Duckworth W.C. Runyan K.R. Wright R.K. Halban P.A. Solomon S.S. Endocrinology. 1981; 108: 1142-1147Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Yet IDE is also capable of degrading many small peptides of unrelated sequence, several of which show amyloidogenic potential in vitro and in vivo such as glucagon, amylin, calcitonin, atrial natriuretic peptide, and Aβ, including all the genetic variants of Aβ associated with dementia or stroke (for reviews, see Refs. 29Kurochkin I.V. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2001; 26: 421-425Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar and 30Morelli L. Llovera R. Gonzalez S.A. Affranchino J.L. Prelli F. Frangione B. Ghiso J. Castaño E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 23221-23226Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Recently the accumulation of endogenous brain soluble Aβ in mice lacking IDE expression after gene targeting has been shown (20Farris W. Mansourian S. Chang Y. Lindsley L. Eckman E.A. Frosch M.P. Eckman C.B. Tanzi R.E. Selkoe D.J. Guenette S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 4162-4167Crossref PubMed Scopus (1185) Google Scholar, 21Miller B.C. Eckman E.A. Sambamurti K. Dobbs N.

This increase was gene dose-dependent for Aβ species ending at positions 40 and 42, respectively, and strongly favors that IDE is a major physiologic Aβ-degrading protease in the mammalian brain. The importance of NEP and IDE in the removal of Aβ has been reinforced by the finding that transgenic overexpression of these proteases in neurons reduced brain soluble Aβ levels and delayed amyloid plaque formation in APP transgenic mice (31Leissring M.A. Farris W. Chang A.Y. Walsh D.M. Wu X. Sun X. Frosch M.P. Selkoe D.J. Neuron. 2003; 40: 1087-1093Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (610) Google Scholar). Moreover IDE activity and mRNA levels have been found to be lower in AD patients as compared with age-matched controls, and such a reduction may be influenced by the ϵ 4 allele of apoE (32Perez A. Morelli L. Cresto J.C. Castaño E.M. Neurochem. Res. 2000; 25: 247-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar, 33Cook D.G. Leverenz J.B. McMillan P.J. Kulstad J.J. Ericksen S. Roth R.A.

Despite the recent advances in our knowledge about Aβ proteolysis by IDE in vitro and in murine models, little is known about the cellular and regional expression and activity of IDE in the brain and its possible role in Aβ-related diseases. The aim of the present study was to investigate IDE in cortical microvessels isolated from human brain, a major target of Aβ accumulation in AD and CAA. We examined its cellular localization and activity against insulin, synthetic Aβ-(1-40) wt, and three major vasculotropic (Flemish, Dutch, and Italian) variants associated with hereditary stroke. To explore a possible pathogenic role of the protease, we determined the levels and activity of IDE in microvessels from late onset sporadic AD patients with CAA and non-demented age-matched controls. Synthetic Peptides—Synthetic Aβ-(1-40) peptides, Aβ wt, Aβ A21G, Aβ E22Q, and Aβ E22K, were synthesized by the W. M. Keck Foundation (Yale University, New Haven, CT). All the peptides were purified by reverse-phase high pressure liquid chromatography, and their purity was assessed by amino acid sequence analysis and laser desorption mass spectrometry. Lyophilized peptides were dissolved in deionized distilled water, centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 30 min to eliminate large aggregates, and stored in aliquots at -85 °C. The state of aggregation of the Aβ species used in this study was assessed by SDS-PAGE and Western blot as reported previously (30Morelli L. Llovera R. Gonzalez S.A. Affranchino J.L. Prelli F.

Expression and Purification of Recombinant Rat IDE—The plasmid pECE-IDE containing the coding region of rat IDE cDNA was kindly provided by Richard Roth, Stanford University. pECE-IDE was used as a template for the PCR amplification of a truncated IDE using the following primers: sense, 5′-AGCACAGGATCCATGAATAATCCGGCCAT-3′ (nucleotides 139-155); antisense, 5′-TTCTCGAGGAGTTTTGCCGCCATGA-3′ (nucleotides 3072-3056). Sites for BamHI and XhoI, respectively, were introduced to facilitate cloning. The PCR product was digested with BamHI and XhoI and cloned into pET-30a(+) from Novagen (Darmstadt, Germany) digested previously with the same restriction enzymes to generate the pET-IDE construct. Recombinant IDE-(42-1019) (rIDE) was expressed in E. coli BL21 and purified using a Hi Trap nickel-chelating column (Amersham Biosciences). The purity and activity of rIDE against 125I-insulin have been characterized previously (30Morelli L. Llovera R. Gonzalez S.A. Affranchino J.L. Prelli F. Frangione B. Ghiso J. Castaño E.M. J. Biol.

Human Tissue—Brain tissue from two individuals (28 and 45 years old, respectively, with a postmortem delay of less than 6 h) who died of non-neurological causes were obtained from the Department of Pathology, Hospital Santojanni, Buenos Aires, Argentina. Samples were provided with a numeric code to preserve identity under a protocol approved by the Institutional Ethical Committee. Brain tissue samples from AD and non-demented (ND) cases were obtained from participants enrolled in the Brain Donation Program of Sun Health Research Institute (Sun City, AZ). Twelve autopsy cases were studied, including six sporadic late onset AD with CAA and six ND controls. Cases were defined as AD if they met the criteria established by the Consortium to establish a registry for Alzheimer's disease (CERAD) for definite or probable AD. Pathological staging was done following criteria established by Braak and Braak (34Braak H. Braak E. Acta Neuropathol. (Berl.). 1991; 82: 239-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (11172) Google Scholar). The presence and severity of CAA was determined by thioflavine S staining and immunohistochemistry with anti-Aβ (see below).

An equal volume of 26% dextran (molecular weight, 65,000-85,000) in the same buffer was added, and the homogenate was centrifuged at 5,800 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. The pellet was resuspended in 10 volumes of buffer A and passed sequentially through 350-, 150-, and 70-μm nylon meshes under vacuum. The material that remained on top of the 150- and 70-μm meshes was recovered by inverting the filters and washing them with a stream of ice-cold buffer A. These fractions were pelleted at 1,000 × g for 10 min, resuspended to 1-2 ml in buffer A, and loaded on top of a preformed Percoll gradient (50% in buffer A, generated at 27,000 × g for 1 h). After centrifugation for 1,000 × g for 10 min, the middle white layer was collected, and the centrifugation on the Percoll gradient was repeated one more time. Fractions were examined under light microscopy and by SDS-PAGE and Western blot. A sample of brain cortical tissue was homogenized in buffer A and centrifuged at 1,500 × g for 5 min, and the supernatant was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C. This material was referred to as brain soluble fraction. The same procedure was followed to obtain a soluble fraction from rat liver as a source of IDE that has been previously purified using monoclonal 9B12 (see below) and characterized by SDS-PAGE (36Ogawa W. Shii K. Yonezawa K. Baba S. Yokono K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 1310-1316Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Antibodies—Rabbit polyclonal BC2 antibodies were generated against a glutathione S-transferase fusion protein containing the sequence 97-273 of rat IDE as described previously (30Morelli L. Llovera R. Gonzalez S.A. Affranchino J.L. Prelli F. Frangione B. Ghiso J. Castaño E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 23221-23226Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) and affinity-purified using rIDE immobilized on CnBr-activated Sepharose 4B (Amersham Biosciences). Anti-IDE monoclonal antibodies 1C1 and 3A2 were obtained by immunization of BALB/c mice with rIDE. Both antibodies were characterized by ELISA and immunoprecipitation (see below), identified as IgG1, and purified from ascitic fluid following standard procedures. Anti-IDE monoclonal 9B12 antibody was a generous gift of Richard Roth (Stanford University). Monoclonal anti-CD31 was from DAKO (Carpenteria, CA); monoclonal anti-laminin and monoclonal anti-α-actin were from Sigma. Rabbit polyclonal anti-neuronal specific enolase (NSE) was obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Monoclonal anti-Aβ 6E10 was obtained from Signet (Dedham, MA), and 3D6 was a gift from Elan Pharmaceuticals. Monoclonal mouse IgG1 against the papilloma virus E2 protein was kindly provided by Fernando Goldbaum, Fundación Instituto Leloir, Buenos Aires, Argentina. Immunohistochemistry and Immunofluorescence—Brain tissue was fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, and 40-μm-thick free floating sections were used for immunohistochemistry with anti-CD31 to label endothelial cells and 3D6 anti-Aβ as described previously (37Lue L.F. Brachova L. Civin W.H. Rogers J. J. Neuropathol. Exp. Neurol. 1996; 55: 1083-1088Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). Isolated microvessels where whole mounted on glass slides, fixed with methanol at -20 °C for 5 min, and blocked with 5% normal goat serum in PBS, pH 7.4, containing 0.05% Tween 20 (PBS-T) for 2 h at room temperature. Monoclonal 9B12 was incubated at 0.15 μg/μl, and monoclonal 1C1 was incubated at 0.25 μg/μl in blocking buffer overnight at 4 °C. Negative controls included a monoclonal IgG1 against E2 (see above) and omission of the first antibodies. For double immunostaining, 1C1 was co-incubated with a biotinylated endothelial cell marker Ulex europaeus agglutinin type 1 (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA); biotin-labeled 1C1 was used in combination with anti-laminin and anti-α-actin. Slides were then washed with PBS-T and incubated for 1 h with Cy2-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Amersham Biosciences) alone or with avidin-Alexa 568 (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). Nuclei were stained with Hoechst 33342 at 5 μg/ml in PBS for 15 min at room temperature. Slides were visualized with a fluorescence microscope (Olympus BX50), and the captured images were processed with Image-Pro Plus software (Media Cybernetics Inc., Silver Spring, MD). Confocal fluorescence microscopy was performed with a dual laser Olympus FV300 microscope, and images were analyzed with acquisition FluoView software, Version 3.3. SDS-PAGE and Western Blots—Recombinant IDE; synthetic Aβ peptides; proteins from microvessel homogenates, brain, and liver soluble fractions; and human erythrocytes at the indicated amounts were analyzed by 7.5 or 12.5% SDS-PAGE in Tris-Tricine gels. For Western blot, proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Amersham Biosciences) and incubated with anti-IDE BC2 at 1:2,000, anti-α-actin at 1:500, and anti-NSE at 1:2,000. Immunoreactivity was detected with anti-rabbit or anti-mouse horseradish peroxidase-labeled IgG and enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL Plus, Amersham Biosciences). Immunoblots were scanned with Storm 840 and analyzed with ImageQuant 5.1 software (Amersham Biosciences). Immunoprecipitation and IDE Activity Assay—To assess the presence and activity of endogenous IDE, isolated brain microvessels were sonicated (Branson 250 sonicator, output 4, three times, 10 s each time, on ice) in 10 volumes of PBS, pH 7.5, containing 2 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, 2 μg/ml pepstatin A, and 10 IU/ml heparin (buffer B) and centrifuged at 5,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. After sonication, the complete disruption of microvessels was assessed by light microscopy. The supernatant was incubated with 7.5 μg/ml monoclonal anti-IDE 9B12 or monoclonal anti-α-actin and protein G-Sepharose for 2 h at room temperature. Immunocomplexes were washed five times in ice-cold buffer containing 0.4 m NaCl, 0.1 m phosphate, pH 7, without protein inhibitors. The protein G-Sepharose beads were then incubated in 50 μl of buffer consisting of 0.1 m phosphate, pH 7, containing 65,000 cpm of 125I-insulin (specific activity, 300 μCi/μg; kindly provided by Edgardo Poskus, University of Buenos Aires) for 1 or 2 h at 37 °C with constant agitation in the presence or absence of the following protease inhibitors at the indicated concentrations: EDTA (5 mm), 1,10-phenanthroline (1 mm), phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride (2 mm), leupeptin (2 μg/ml), pepstatin A (2 μg/ml), aprotinin (2 μg/ml), thiorphan (50 μm), and phosphoramidon (50 μm). After incubation, beads were centrifuged at 1,500 × g for 5 min. Twenty microliters of the supernatant were removed, mixed with an equal volume of 8% SDS sample buffer, boiled, and resolved by 15% Tris-Tricine SDS-PAGE under non-reducing conditions. The amount of intact remaining 125I-insulin was estimated with a Storm 840 PhosphorImager (Amersham Biosciences), and proteolysis was expressed as the percentage of degradation determined by (A - B)/A × 100 where A represents the intensity of intact 125I-insulin incubated with protein G-Sepharose alone and B represents the intensity of intact 125I-insulin after incubation with 9B12 or anti-α-actin immunoprecipitates. As a positive control, 10-50 ng of purified rIDE were incubated with radiolabeled insulin in the presence of protein G-Sepharose, and degradation was assessed as described above. Within this range, there was a linear correlation between the amount of rIDE and the extent of 125I-insulin degradation (not shown). Aβ Proteolysis and Mass Spectrometry—Molecular masses of intact Aβ peptides and the products generated by endogenous IDE were analyzed by mass spectrometry. Synthetic Aβ peptides were incubated with 9B12 or anti-α-actin immunoprecipitates at 2 μm in 0.1 m phosphate buffer, pH 7, in the presence or absence of the indicated inhibitors for 1 h at 37 °C with constant agitation. After centrifugation at 1,500 × g for 3 min, 10-μl samples collected from the supernatants were passed through a reverse-phase ZipTip (Millipore, Billerica, MA) following the manufacturer's instructions. Samples were then analyzed on a Micro-mass TofSpec-2E (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometer in linear mode using standard instrument settings at the New York University Protein Analysis Facility. Internal and/or external calibration was carried out using angiotensin I (average mass, 1296.5 Da) and insulin (average mass, 5733.5 Da). The profiles shown are representative of three independent experiments. To assess the extent of aggregation, aliquots of Aβ peptides incubated with or without IDE were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blot with 6E10 as described above. IDE Quantification with Sandwich ELISA—Monoclonal antibody 3A2 was coated on microtiter plates (Nunc) at 3 μg/well in PBS, pH 7.4, for 16 h at 4 °C. After blocking with 3% bovine serum albumin in PBS for 4 h at room temperature, 20-100 μg of proteins from microvessels homogenates, as determined with a BCA kit (Pierce), were incubated in binding buffer (20 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.5, 0.4 m NaCl containing 0.3% bovine serum albumin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin A, 2 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, 2 mm EDTA) for 16 h at 4 °C. Wells were washed with PBS containing 0.2% Tween 20, and biotinylated monoclonal 1C1 was incubated at 5 μg/ml in binding buffer for 2 h at room temperature. Wells were washed as above and incubated with peroxidase-conjugated streptavidin (Jackson Immunor"

The unexpected finding of substantial amounts of ornithine, the nonprotein amino acid, and decarbamidation product of arginine in acid hydrolysates of lens crystallins and skin collagen led us to investigate its source and mechanism of formation. In order to exclude ornithine formation as an artifact of acid hydrolysis, proteins were reductively alkylated with formaldehyde to convert ornithine to dimethyl-ornithine. The proteins were assayed for carboxymethyl-ornithine and glycated ornithine (“furornithine”) by liquid chromatography coupled to electrospray ionization mass spectrometry. Ornithine in acid hydrolysates of human lens and skin proteins increased from 1 to 15 nmol/mg protein from ages 10 to 90 years, whereas dimethyl-ornithine increased from 0.5 to 15 and from 0 to 5 nmol/mg protein, respectively. Carboxymethyl-ornithine and furornithine increased with age in lens and skin from ∼0 to 60 and 0 to 180 pmol/mg protein, respectively. In collagen, ornithine was elevated above levels of nondiabetic controls only when both diabetes and end stage renal disease were present. The age-related increase of these modifications provides evidence for substantial in vivo formation of ornithine in aging human tissue proteins. The mechanism of ornithine formation is not known, but data suggest that arginine-derived advanced glycation end products might serve as precursors for the in vivo conversion of ornithine from arginine.

The mechanism of ornithine formation is not known, but data suggest that arginine-derived advanced glycation end products might serve as precursors for the in vivo conversion of ornithine from arginine. Reducing sugars react with long lived proteins in vivo, resulting in molecular adducts and cross-links collectively referred to as advanced glycation end products (AGEs), 1The abbreviations used are: AGE, advanced glycation end product; BSA, bovine serum albumin; CML, Nϵ-carboxymethyl-lysine; CMO, Nδ-carboxymethyl-ornithine; d4-CML, deuterated 4,4,5,5-d4-Nϵ-carboxymethyl-lysine; d6-ornithine, deuterated 3,3,4,4,5,5 d6-ornithine; 3DG, 3-deoxyglucosone; DMO, Nδ,Nδ-dimethyl-ornithine; DOGDIC, 3-deoxyglucosone-derived imidazoline cross-link; ECM, extracellular matrix; ESI, electrospray ionization; ESRD, end stage renal disease; G, glyoxal; G-H1, glyoxal-derived hydroimidazolone; GODIC, glyoxal-derived imidazoline cross-link; HPLC, high pressure (performance) liquid chromatography; LC, liquid chromatography; NCE, normalized collision energy; MS, mass spectrometry; MG, methylgloxal; MG-H1, methylglyoxal-derived hydroimidazolone; MODIC, methylglyoxal-derived imidazoline cross-link; RT, retention time; SRM, selected reaction monitoring; TDFHA, tridecafluoroheptanoic acid; ESI, electrospray ionization. which are thought to be important in diabetic complications and the aging phenomenon (1Cerami A.

Sinai J. Med. 2003; 70: 232-241PubMed Google Scholar). Glycation begins with the reducing sugar reacting nonenzymatically with the free amino group of the protein to form an Amadori product (1Cerami A. Vlassara H. Brownlee M. Sci. Am. 1987; 256: 90-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). The latter can undergo a series of complex reactions involving both oxidative and nonoxidative chemistry resulting in AGE formation (7Baynes J.W. Thorpe S.R. Diabetes. 1999; 48: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (2158) Google Scholar). Although the ϵ-amino group of lysine bears primary importance in its reactivity with reducing sugars in forming Amadori products and AGEs, evidence suggests that the guanidino group of arginine is also actively involved in these reactions. Arginine can react with the oxoaldehydes methylglyoxal (MG), glyoxal (G), and 3-deoxyglucosone (3DG), to produce the hydroimidazolones MG-H1, G-H1, and 3DG-H1, respectively (Fig. 1) (8Thornalley P.J. Cell. Mol. Biol. 1998; 44: 1013-1023PubMed Google Scholar, 9Ahmed N. Argirov O.K. Minhas H.S. Cordeiro C.A.A. Thornalley P.J. Biochem. J. 2002; 364: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). Likewise, MG can also react directly with arginine to form argpyrimidine (Fig. 1) (10Shipanova I.N. Glomb M.A. Nagaraj R.H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1997; 344: 29-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). Additionally, arginine is also able to undergo reaction with the lysine-derived Amadori products of pentoses and glucose to form the cross-links pentosidine (11Grandhee S.K. Monnier V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 11649-11653Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and glucosepane (12Biemel K.M. Friedl D.A. Lederer M.O. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 24907-24915Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Similarly, MG, G, and 3DG can react with lysine and arginine to form the imidazoline cross-links MODIC, GODIC, and DOGDIC, respectively (Fig. 1) (12Biemel K.M. Friedl D.A. Lederer M.O. J. Biol.

In the present research, the unexpected and consistent finding of ornithine in our chromatographic profiles of acid-hydrolyzed insoluble human lens and collagen in association with chronological age led us to investigate its source and mechanism of formation. In vivo, ornithine is formed in the liver by the urea cycle via enzymatic cleavage of arginine into ornithine and urea by arginase (15Wu G. Morris Jr., S.M. Biochem. J. 1998; 336: 1-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (2224) Google Scholar, 16Nelson D.L. Cox M.M. Lehninger Principles of Biochemistry. 4th Ed. W. H. Freeman Co., New York2004Google Scholar). Similar cleavage occurs in extrahepatic tissues, where ornithine is a precursor for the biosynthesis of proline, spermidine, spermine, and nitric oxide (17Yu H. Yoo P.K. Aguirre C.C. Tsoa R.W. Kern R.M. Grody W.W. Cederbaum S.D. Lyer R.K. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 2003; 51: 1151-1160Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). However, ornithine, to our knowledge, has never been described in the primary structure of proteins, since there is neither any codon nor any aminoacyl-tRNA and amino acid synthetase specific for ornithine for transcription, translation, and protein synthesis (16Nelson D.L. Cox M.M. Lehninger Principles of Biochemistry. 4th Ed. W. H. Freeman Co., New York2004Google Scholar). Thus, ornithine is not found in native proteins (16Nelson D.L. Cox M.M. Lehninger Principles of Biochemistry. 4th Ed. W. H. Freeman Co., New York2004Google Scholar). Because of these issues, a number of interesting questions arose concerning the origin of ornithine in our biological specimens (i.e. as to whether it is truly present in proteins in vivo or whether it is merely an artifact of acid hydrolysis of proteins rich in hydroimidazolones as suggested by Paul et al. (18Paul R.G. Avery N.C. Slatter D.A. Sims T.J. Bailey A.J. Biochem. J. 1998; 330: 1241-1248Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar)). Thus, the purpose of the present research is 2-fold: (i) to investigate whether ornithine truly exists in the primary structure of long lived proteins and (ii) to investigate its biological significance as to its age-related increase and mechanism of formation in insoluble skin collagen and lens proteins. The major outcome of this study is that it provides the first and unequivocal demonstration that ornithine forms in substantial quantities during aging of collagen and lens crystallins and that it itself becomes glycated and glycoxidized with age. Chemicals—Except as noted below, most chemicals and solvents were from Aldrich, Sigma, or Fisher and were of the highest grade available. Methylglyoxal was from Fluka (Milwaukee, WI) and was purified by distillation according to McLellan and Thornalley (19McLellan A.C. Thornalley P.J. Anal. Chim. Acta. 1992; 263: 137-142Crossref Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Standards of MG-H1 and G-H1 were generously provided by Dr. Paul Thornalley (University of Essex, Colchester, Essex, UK); glucosepane, MODIC, GODIC, and DOGDIC were from Dr. Klaus Biemel (University of Hohenheim, Stuttgart, GR); argpyrimidine was from Dr. Marcus Glomb (Technical University of Berlin, Berlin, GR); and Nϵ-carboxymethyl-lysine-4,4,5,5-d4 (d4-CML) was from Dr. John Baynes (University of South Carolina, Columbia, SC). l-Ornithine HCL-3,3,4,4,5,5-d6 (d6-ornithine) was purchased from Cambridge Isotope Laboratories (Andover, MA). Nδ-Carboxymethyl-ornithine (CMO), Nδ-(2-furoylmethyl)-l-ornithine (“furornithine”), and Nδ,Nδ-dimethyl-ornithine (DMO) were synthesized as detailed elsewhere (see Supplemental Material). The chemical formulas for the arginine-derived AGEs measured in this study are shown in Figs. 1 and 2. Overview of Analytical Techniques Used in This Work—For both historical reasons, such as the introduction of new instrumentation during the course of this work, and scientific reasons, such as the stability, sensitivity, and derivatibility of the products assayed, various techniques have been used. To summarize, for most of the experiments described below, high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) coupled to electrospray ionization (ESI) mass spectrometry (scan mode n = 2; i.e. MS/MS) with selected reaction monitoring (SRM) has been used for qualitative and quantitative analyses as follows: (i) isobutyl ester derivatives of ornithine, CMO, and DMO in acid hydrolysates of lens and collagen; (ii) isobutyl ester derivative of ornithine in lens digest; and (iii) underivatized furornithine and ornithine levels in acid hydrolysates of the same samples. In several experiments, HPLC ESI-MS (scan mode n = 1) has been used to quantitate ornithine as follows: (i) isopropyl derivative of acid-hydrolyzed lens; (ii) isobutyl derivative of acid-hydrolyzed standards of arginine and argpyrimidine (Fig. 1); (iii) various acid-hydrolyzed standards of AGEs listed in Fig. 1 without derivatization. Except for pentosidine (m/z = 379), all ions measured by MS were in the (M + H)+ form. Tissue Procurement, Donor Information, and Classification of Lenses—For the most part, skin samples used in this study are identical to those described in an earlier study (20Sell D.R. Carlson E.C. Monnier V.M. Diabetologia. 1993; 36: 936-941Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Totals of n = 113 skin samples were from the University Hospitals of Cleveland (Cleveland, OH), n = 6 from the National Disease Research Interchange (Philadelphia, PA), and n = 1 (age 19 years) from the Cuyahoga County Coroner's Office (Cleveland, OH). Totals of n = 46 human lenses were obtained from the National Disease Research Interchange. Categorization as to gender and race, diagnoses of diabetes and renal disease, and primary cause of death were evaluated from each donor's post-mortem records and clinical charts (skin) or donor information and medical history review forms (lens). Additionally, lenses were classified according to the degree of pigmentation into Pirie grade I (n = 19), II (n = 11), III (n = 6), and IV (n = 0) (21Pirie A. Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 1965; 4: 629-637Google Scholar). For some lenses, an arbitrary grade 1.5 (n = 7), 2.5 (n = 3) was used when classification between I and II or between II and III, etc., was equivocal. Preparation of Human Insoluble Skin Collagen—Tissues were stored at –80 °C until use. Briefly, skin samples were defatted (2:1 chloroform-methanol), extracted (1 m sodium chloride and 0.5 m acetic acid), digested (0.1% pepsin in 0.5 m acetic acid at 4 °C), and freeze-dried as previously detailed (20Sell D.R. Carlson E.C. Monnier V.M. Diabetologia. 1993; 36: 936-941Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Samples of ∼5 mg were weighed and processed as described below. Preparation and Enzymatic Digestion of Human Lens Crystallins— Human lenses were stored frozen at –20 °C until processing. Upon thawing, each lens was immediately homogenized in Chelex-treated phosphate-buffered saline, and the insoluble pellet was obtained by modification of procedures of Nagaraj et al. (22Nagaraj R.H. Sell D.R. Prabhakaram M. Ortwerth B.J. Monnier V.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci U. S. A. 1991; 88: 10257-10261Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar) (see Supplemental Material). The insoluble pellet of lens crystallins obtained was freeze-dried and stored at –20 °C. In order to avoid artifactual generation of ornithine during acid hydrolysis, lens crystallins were proteolytically digested. The enzymatic hydrolysis protocol described by Glomb and Pfahler (23Glomb M.A. Pfahler C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 45: 41638-41647Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (124) Google Scholar) was used with some modification. Freeze-dried samples of ∼5.5 mg were weighed and sequentially digested at 37 °C at pH 7.4 for 24-h consecutive intervals by proteinase K, peptidase, Pronase, and aminopeptidase M (see Supplemental Material). The overall percentage digestion for each sample was determined by the ninhydrin reaction (24Moore S. Stein W.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1954; 211: 907-913Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) by dividing total leucine equivalents assayed for each digest by the same upon acid hydrolysis. For the results below, protein concentration was approximated by assuming that every 10 μmol of leucine equivalents is equal to 1 mg of protein. Sample Preparation of Skin Collagen for HPLC—Skin collagen samples were injected onto the HPLC either as isobutyl derivatives or nonderivatized forms (see Supplemental Material). For derivatization, aliquots of acid-hydrolyzed collagen, the equivalent of 50 μg of hydroxyproline (∼357 μg of collagen) were pipetted into borosilicate tubes together with the following deuterated internal standards: 7 nmol of d6-ornithine and 98 pmol of d4-CML. The content of each tube was dried by a SpeedVac evaporator (Thermo Savant, Holbrook, NY) followed by conversion of amino acids into their isobutyl esters by heating the tubes at 73 °C for 1.5 h in the presence of anhydrous 2-butanol acidified with 0.4 m thionyl chloride. The latter reagents were removed by the Speed-Vac set to a high drying rate. The dried residue was reconstituted with 25 μl of an injection solvent consisting of 11.5 mm formic acid and 2.75 mm tridecafluoroheptanoic acid (TDFHA) and transferred to a microinjection vial. In cases where samples were injected in the underivatized form, aliquots of acid-hydrolyzed collagen or lens hydrolysates were pipetted directly into the microvials and spiked with the internal standards as previously described. After drying the samples, the content of each vial was reconstituted with 20 μl of the injection solvent followed by injection into the HPLC using the autosampler as described below. Ornithine Determination in Enzymatic Digests of Insoluble Lens Crystallins—In order to determine the effects of acid hydrolysis on ornithine yield, the enzymatic lens digest was analyzed with and without acid hydrolysis (see Supplemental Material). Briefly, aliquots of digests were acid-hydrolyzed followed by esterification with 2-propanol for HPLC ESI-MS analysis. Ornithine concentration was determined by its parent mass at m/z 175 with correction for the response of the internal standard, d6-ornithine, at m/z 181. Additionally, enzymatic digests of lens crystallins were prepared without acid hydrolysis for ornithine assay by HPLC ESI-MS/MS SRM analyses. An aliquot of each digest was spiked with internal standards and derivatized with 2-butanol. Reductive Alkylation of Insoluble Collagen and Lens Crystallins—In order to prove that ornithine is present in proteins prior to any manipulation, samples were reductively alkylated in order to generate acidstable DMO using the procedure of Jentoft and Dearborn (25Jentoft N. Dearborn D.G. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 91: 570-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Totals of 3 mg of insoluble lens pellet or 6–7 mg of insoluble skin collagen were reductively alkylated by continuous rotation overnight at 4 °C in tubes containing 83 mm each of sodium cyanoborohydride and formaldehyde in 0.1 m sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7 (see Supplemental Material). The recovered pellet was freeze-dried and acid-hydrolyzed according to previously published procedures (26Sell D.R. Lane M.A. Obrenovich M.E. Mattison J.A. Handy A. Ingram D.K. Cutler R.G. Roth G.S. Monnier V.M. J. Gerontol. Biol. Sci. 2003; 58A: 508-516Crossref Google Scholar). Additionally, in order to study the effect of protein unfolding on the yield of DMO, some samples were reductively alkylated in the presence of urea. The procedure was done simultaneously with that described for reductive alkylation, except that 7 m urea was added to the buffer prior to adjusting the pH to 7. Reduction of Collagen with Borohydride and Cyanoborohydride— Collagen was reduced according to procedures stated above for reductive alkylation, except no formaldehyde was used in the buffer. The purpose of this experiment was to investigate whether precursors of ornithine exist that may be composed of acid-labile reducible chemical bonds. Collagen was prepared by weighing insoluble skin samples from n = 11 different donors of age range 15–90 years. Each sample was weighed into three portions consisting of 6 mg each followed by treating each portion in one of three ways as follows: (i) control, no reduction; (ii) reduction with 0.1 m sodium borohydride; or (iii) reduction with 0.1 m sodium cyanoborohydride. Quantitative Analyses of Ornithine, CMO, Furornithine, and DMO by HPLC ESI-MS/MS SRM—Liquid chromatography was carried out using a Michrom Magic 2002 HPLC (Michrom BioResources, Auburn, CA). The pump flow at 120 μl/min was split 1:12 (column/waste) by the Magic Precolumn Variable Splitter (Michrom), which resulted in a column flow at 10 μl/min. Samples of 1–2 μl were injected onto a 15 cm × 0.32 mm, 5-μm Discovery BIO Wide Pore C18 capillary type column (Supelco; Sigma) using an Alcott model 718AL autosampler (Alcott Chromatography, Norcross, GA). The eluate from the column was transferred to the Finnigan LCQDuo Mass Spectrometer (Thermo Electron, San Jose, CA) as detailed elsewhere (see Supplemental Material). Solvents used for HPLC were as follows: solvent A, water; solvent B, 70% acetonitrile in water (Burdick & Jackson Certified Solvents, Honeywell, Inc., Muskegon, MI). For ornithine, CMO, and DMO assays, both solvents contained 11.5 mm formic acid and 0.25 mm TDFHA. For the furornithine assay where samples were not derivatized, the TDFHA concentration in solvent A was increased to 1.5 mm to maintain peak sharpness and resolution. The use of TDFHA as an ion pairing agent for HPLC separations was adapted from the work of Chaimbault et al. (27Chaimbault P. Petritis K. Elfakir C. Dreux M. J. Chromatogr. A. 1999; 855: 191-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). The isobutyl derivatives of ornithine, CMO, and DMO were separated on the capillary column using the following gradient system as designated by the (x,y) pair, where x represents gradient program time in minutes and y represents percentage of solvent B: (0, 0), (1, 25), (40, 100), (49, 100), (50, 0). For furornithine and underivatized ornithine, the gradient program was as follows: (0, 0), (1, 25), (20, 65), (21, 100), (30, 100), (31, 0). The column was maintained at 40 °C for all assays. Programming of the MS for assays of ornithine, CMO, furornithine, and DMO, including parent and product ions, can be found in the figure legends and the Supplemental Material. A detailed description of the system controls for the LC/MS can also be found in the Supplemental Material. Preparation of AGE-BSA from the Incubation of BSA with Reducing Sugar—Bovine serum albumin (BSA, Fraction V, heat shock, fatty acid-free; Roche Applied Science) was incubated at 15 mg/ml in 0.05 m sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, for 7 days at 37 °C in 10-ml volumes with 20 mm each of the following sugars: d-ribose, dl-glyceraldehyde, glyoxal, and methylglyoxal. In addition, BSA was incubated similarly with 200 mm d-glucose for either 3 or 82 days (see Supplemental Material). Reductive Alkylation, Acid Hydrolysis, and Assay for Ornithine and DMO in AGE-BSA—AGE-BSA preparations were reductively alkylated as described above with minor modifications. Samples of ∼7 mg each of AGE-BSA preparation, but also unmodified BSA as a control, were reductively alkylated in duplicates. Further procedures for acid hydrolysis and assays of these preparations are detailed in the Supplemental Material. Acid Hydrolysis of Arginine and a Series of AGE Standards for Screening of Precursors for Ornithine Formation—A series of experiments were designed to determine whether ornithine could be generated from arginine and arginine-derived AGEs shown in Fig. 1. In the first experiment, aliquots of l-arginine (SigmaUltra) consisting of 0.25, 0.5, 1.0, and 1.5 nmol were each acid-hydrolyzed in a total of 300 μl of 6 n HCl (see Supplemental Material). In a second experiment, aliquots of standards (Table I) were each evaporated and acid-hydrolyzed in 300 μl of 6 n HCl at concentrations as follows: (i) 0.1–0.60 pmol of pentosidine; (ii) 0.25–1.5 nmol each of argpyrimidine, G-H1, and MG-H1; (iii) 112-1050 nmol each of 70 mm glucosepane, MODIC, GODIC, and DOG-DIC.

In these analyses, race, gender, diabetes, and renal failure were coded with indicator variables as follows: race, 1 = Caucasian, 2 = African-American; gender, 1 = male, 2 = female; diabetes, 0 = absence of diabetes, 1 = type 1, 2 = type 2; renal failure, 0 = absence of chronic renal disease or end stage renal disease (ESRD), 1 = chronic renal disease, 2 = ESRD, as previously defined (20Sell D.R.

All lens samples were from Caucasians. The products assayed in this study and their presumed chemical relationships are summarized in Fig. 2, whereby any of the arginine-AGEs in Fig. 1 is regarded as a potential precursor for ornithine formation in vivo or during acid hydrolysis. Ornithine, CMO, and Furornithine Levels in Acid-hydrolyzed Human Insoluble Skin Collagen—Ornithine, glycated ornithine (furornithine), and CMO were measured in acid hydrolysates of insoluble skin collagen by HPLC ESI-MS/MS SRM. Amino acids were converted into their isobutyl ester derivatives, as detailed under “Experimental Procedures,” whereupon ornithine eluted at ∼25–26 min in the chromatogram (Fig. 3). Skin levels followed as a function of age, diabetes, and renal failure are shown in Fig. 4A. Ornithine increased linearly (p < 0.0001) with age in nondiabetic subjects without renal failure and reached ∼ 4 nmol/mg collagen at age 90 years (Fig. 4A). Stepwise multivariate linear regression analyses revealed that age (p < 0.0001) and renal failure (p = 0.035) were selected as predictors for ornithine formation in skin with the equation, ornithine = 1.4 + 0.03(age) + 0.458(renal failure), whereby renal failure included both chronic renal disease and ESRD as defined under “Statistical Methods.”Fig. 4The effect of age, diabetes, and renal failure on formation levels of ornithine and its modifications in acid-hydrolyzed insoluble human skin collagen.

Munc18-1, a neural-specific member of the Sec1/Munc18 protein family, binds to syntaxin1A, stabilizing this closed conformation. We used fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) to characterize the Munc18-1/syntaxin1A interaction in intact cells. Enhanced cyan fluorescent protein-Munc18-1 and a citrine variant of enhanced yellow fluorescent protein-syntaxin1A, or mutants of these proteins, were expressed as donor and acceptor pairs in human embryonic kidney HEK293-S3 and adrenal chromaffin cells. Apparent FRET efficiency was measured using two independent approaches with complementary results that unambiguously verified FRET and provided a spatial map of FRET efficiency. In addition, enhanced cyan fluorescent protein-Munc18-1 and a citrine variant of enhanced yellow fluorescent protein-syntaxin1A colocalized with a Golgi marker and exhibited FRET at early expression times, whereas a strong plasma membrane colocalization, with similar FRET values, was apparent at later times. Trafficking of syntaxin1A to the plasma membrane was dependent on the presence of Munc18-1. Both syntaxin1A(L165A/E166A), a constitutively open conformation mutant, and syntaxin1A(I233A), an H3 domain point mutant, demonstrated apparent FRET efficiency that was reduced ∼70% from control. In contrast, the H3 domain mutant syntaxin1A(I209A) had no effect. By using phosphomimetic mutants of Munc18-1, we also established that Ser-313, a Munc18-1 protein kinase C phosphorylation site, and Thr-574, a cyclin-dependent kinase 5 phosphorylation site, regulate Munc18-1/syntaxin1A interaction in HEK293-S3 and chromaffin cells. We conclude that FRET imaging in living cells may allow correlated regulation of Munc18-1/syntaxin1A interactions to Ca2+-regulated secretory events.

We conclude that FRET imaging in living cells may allow correlated regulation of Munc18-1/syntaxin1A interactions to Ca2+-regulated secretory events. Synaptic transmission is triggered by Ca2+-dependent fusion of synaptic vesicles with the presynaptic membrane. Central to the vesicular targeting, docking, and fusion process that underlie this regulated exocytotic event are soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor and its attachment protein (SNAP) 1The abbreviations used are: SNAP, soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein; SNARE, SNAP receptor; SM, Sec1/Munc18; PKC, protein kinase C; Cdk, cyclin-dependent kinase; FRET, fluorescence resonance energy transfer; CFP, enhanced cyan fluorescent protein; cYFP, citrine mutant of enhanced yellow fluorescent protein; HEK, human embryonic kidney; PSS, physiological saline solution.1The abbreviations used are: SNAP, soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein; SNARE, SNAP receptor; SM, Sec1/Munc18; PKC, protein kinase C; Cdk, cyclin-dependent kinase; FRET, fluorescence resonance energy transfer; CFP, enhanced cyan fluorescent protein; cYFP, citrine mutant of enhanced yellow fluorescent protein; HEK, human embryonic kidney; PSS, physiological saline solution. and membrane-bound receptors (SNAREs) (1Sudhof T.C.

Synaptic vesicles contain the v-SNARE synaptobrevin (also termed VAMP) that interacts with high specificity to the integral presynaptic plasma membrane t-SNAREs syntaxin1A and SNAP25. These SNARE proteins assemble into a ternary complex via interaction of their SNARE motifs into parallel four-helix bundles (4Sollner T. Bennett M.K. Whiteheart S.W. Scheller R.H. Rothman J.E.

Nature. 1993; 362: 318-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (2589) Google Scholar). SNARE complex assembly is believed to facilitate close membrane apposition and is a step essential to the fusion of synaptic vesicles with the plasma membrane (6Rizo J. Sudhof T.C. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2002; 3: 641-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar). The assembly of trans-SNARE complexes for Ca2+-regulated exocytosis is subject to strict spatial and temporal regulation (7Gundelfinger E.D. Kessels M.M. Qualmann B. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 4: 127-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). Members of the Sec1/Munc18 (SM) gene family have also emerged as proteins essential for membrane trafficking and fusion (8Toonen R.F. Verhage M. Trends Cell Biol. 2003; 13: 177-186Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). This is evidenced by the accumulation of vesicles in loss of function SM mutants in yeast (9Novick P. Field C. Schekman R.

Neurochem. 1992; 58: 1517-1525Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). SM proteins bind with high affinity to members of the syntaxin gene family and exhibit strong specificity to a membrane transport pathway, although members of the family are highly homologous and may interact with more than one syntaxin isoform (14Pevsner J. J. Neurosci. Res. 1996; 45: 89-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Consistent with a strict specificity, the way SM proteins interact with syntaxins is fundamentally different among different SM/syntaxin pairs. For example, yeast Sec1p binds to assembled SNARE complexes at the cell membrane, yeast Sly1p binds to a conserved N-terminal domain of syntaxin for fusion of transport vesicles from the endoplasmic reticulum to Golgi, whereas interaction of mammalian Munc18-1 with syntaxin at the plasma membrane requires the complete cytosolic domain of syntaxin and is absent in assembled SNARE complexes (15Carr C.M.

However, despite considerable evidence demonstrating their necessity for normal membrane trafficking and fusion, the precise function(s) of SM proteins remains poorly defined. In the case of synaptic transmission, the SM protein Munc18-1 binds with high affinity to the plasma membrane t-SNARE syntaxin1A. Syntaxin1A consists of an N-terminal domain composed of an antiparallel three-helix bundle (termed the Habc domain) that is connected via a short flexible linker to a SNARE motif (H3 domain) residing just proximal to a single-transit transmembrane domain (25Bennett M.K. Calakos N. Scheller R.H. Science. 1992; 257: 255-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (1060) Google Scholar, 26Fernandez I. Ubach J. Dulubova I. Zhang X. Sudhof T.C. Rizo J. Cell. 1998; 94: 841-849Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). Analysis of the crystal structure of syntaxin1A showed that, in the absence of additional protein interactions, syntaxin1A adopts a folded conformation, whereby the Habc domain folds onto the H3 domain, and the structure is stabilized by a hydrophobic groove of the Habc domain orientated toward the H3 domain (22Misura K.M. Scheller R.H. Weis W.I. Nature. 2000; 404: 355-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (599) Google Scholar). The folding of syntaxin1A into this conformation hinders interaction of its SNARE motif with its cognate SNAREs and, thereby, inhibits assembly of SNARE core complexes (27Pevsner J. Hsu S.C. Braun J.E. Calakos N. Ting A.E. Bennett M.K. Scheller R.H. Neuron. 1994; 13: 353-361Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (522) Google Scholar, 28Dulubova I. Sugita S. Hill S. Hosaka M. Fernandez I. Sudhof T.C. Rizo J. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4372-4382Crossref PubMed Scopus (541) Google Scholar). Paradoxical to its necessity for exocytosis, Munc18-1 in vitro interacts with and stabilizes this folded conformation of syntaxin1A and inhibits the association of VAMP/synaptobrevin and SNAP25 with syntaxin1A (28Dulubova I. Sugita S. Hill S. Hosaka M. Fernandez I. Sudhof T.C. Rizo J. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4372-4382Crossref PubMed Scopus (541) Google Scholar, 29Yang B. Steegmaier M. Gonzalez Jr., L.C. Scheller R.H. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 247-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). However, in vivo evidence also suggests that the Munc18-1 interaction is essential to facilitate trafficking of syntaxin1A from the Golgi to the plasma membrane as well as to promote a conformational change in syntaxin1A required for interaction of its SNARE motif with cognate SNARE proteins and/or to nucleate zippering of SNARE protein complexes together (2Jahn R. Lang T. Sudhof T.C. Cell. 2003; 112: 519-533Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1200) Google Scholar, 6Rizo J. Sudhof T.C. Nat. Rev.

Conformational opening of syntaxin1A is a critical regulatory step in SNARE complex formation, because opening of the yeast syntaxin ortholog Sso1 increases by 2000-fold assembly of the SNARE core complex (31Nicholson K.L. Munson M. Miller R.B. Filip T.J. Fairman R. Hughson F.M. Nat. Struct.

Thus, there is compelling evidence to support regulation of the Munc18-1/syntaxin1A interaction as a critical determinant in the SNARE complex assembly that is necessary for the Ca2+-dependent exocytotic process of neurotransmitter release and synaptic transmission. A number of mechanisms regulating the assembly and disassociation of the Munc18-1/syntaxin1A complex have been proposed. Among these, regulation by protein phosphorylation has been best characterized. For example, Munc18-1 has been shown both in vitro and in vivo to be a substrate for protein kinase C (PKC), cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (Cdk5), and death-associated protein kinase (34Fujita Y.

Phosphorylation by PKC occurs on Ser-306 and Ser-313 in vitro and results in a reduction in the affinity of Munc18-1 for syntaxin1A and inhibition of formation of Munc18-1/syntaxin1A complexes (34Fujita Y.

Functionally, PKC phosphorylation of Ser-313 has been reported to alter the dynamics of vesicle release events (23Fisher R.J. Pevsner J. Burgoyne R.D.

By comparison, Cdk5 phosphorylates Munc18-1 at a single site in vitro (Thr-576), and this phosphorylation is capable of mediating disassembly of preassembled Munc18-1/syntaxin1A complexes (38Fletcher A.I.

Pharmacological inhibition of Cdk5 inhibited induced secretion from adrenal chromaffin cells (38Fletcher A.I. Shuang R. Giovannucci D.R. Zhang L. Bittner M.A. Stuenkel E.L. J. Biol.

In addition to protein phosphorylation, a number of direct protein-mediated mechanisms have also been suggested as important regulators of the Munc18-1/syntaxin1A complex. Included among these are proteins of the Munc13 and tomosyn gene families. Munc13 binds to the N terminus of syntaxin1A, and this interaction has been proposed to stabilize an open conformation of syntaxin that is necessary for pairing the syntaxin1A SNARE motif with cognate SNAREs (40Betz A.

Tomosyn contains a single C-terminal V-SNARE motif that can substitute for the VAMP SNARE in syntaxin1A SNARE complexes (42Fujita Y. Shirataki H. Sakisaka T. Asakura T. Ohya T. Kotani H. Yokoyama S.

To date, characterization of specific mechanisms of formation and disassembly of a Munc18-1/syntaxin1A complex have relied on in vitro biochemical assays of protein-protein interaction and mechanistic interpretations of alterations in functional responses using genetic approaches in cell or animal models (2Jahn R.

However, to characterize the temporal and spatial aspects of regulation associated with activation of the secretory pathway requires an experimental approach that directly reports the state of the bimolecular Munc18-1/syntaxin1A protein interaction within living cells. In the present study, we used fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) as a non-invasive imaging method to characterize the interaction of Munc18-1 with syntaxin1A in both the HEK293-S3 cell line and in primary cultures of bovine adrenal chromaffin cells. As FRET probes we used enhanced cyan fluorescent protein (CFP) and the citrine variant of enhanced yellow fluorescent protein (cYFP) fused to the N termini of Munc18-1 and syntaxin1A, respectively. Two independent FRET methods have been used to provide additional confidence in measurement and quantification of apparent FRET efficiency of the bimolecular interactions. To establish the selectivity of the FRET signal and to establish the sensitivity of the approach to report changes in the affinity of the bimolecular interaction within cells, we have tested the effects of various expression paradigms and mutants of Munc18-1 and syntaxin1A. In addition, we evaluated the effect of PKC and of Cdk5 phosphorylation of Munc18-1 on formation of Munc18-1/syntaxin1A complexes and on the trafficking of syntaxin1A from the Golgi complex to the plasma membrane. Chemicals and Expression Constructs—Mouse monoclonal antibody against syntaxin1A was from Sigma; mouse monoclonal antibody against Munc18-1 and the Golgi marker protein GS27 were from BD Transduction Lab (San Jose, CA); Alexa Fluor-647 and Alexa Fluor-488 goat anti-mouse antibodies were from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). All other chemicals were obtained from Sigma. HEK293 cells stably expressing the rat α1B and human β1B and α2δ voltage-gated calcium channel subunits (termed HEK293-S3 cells) were a gift from D. Rock (Warner-Lambert Parke Davis, Ann Arbor, MI). The LoxP sequence from pLP-EGFP-C1 (Clontech) was subcloned into the multiple cloning site regions of pcDNA3.1, pECFP-C1, and pEcYFP-C1 (Q39M mutant of pEYFP-C1) to generate recipient vectors for subcloning using the Cre-recombinase-mediated Creator System (Clontech). Rat Munc18-1 and rat syntaxin1A were merged to the C terminus of the enhanced cyan mutant of green fluorescent protein (ECFP) and EcYFP. Mutants of Munc18-1 and syntaxin 1A were constructed using the polymerase chain reaction-based Quickchange Site-Directed Mutagenesis kit from Stratagene (Cedar Creek, TX). The sequence fidelity of all expression constructs was confirmed by DNA sequencing (University of Michigan DNA Sequencing Core). Cell Culture and Transfections—HEK293-S3 cells were plated and cultured in RPMI 1640 with l-glutamine supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 1% penicillin/streptomycin (Life Technologies, Inc.), 0.4 mg/ml of hygromycin, and 0.6 mg/ml of geneticin at 37 °C in 95% O2-5% CO2 for 2 days on coverslips (thickness 1) affixed to the bottom of 35-mm culture dishes before transfection. Transfections were performed using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen), according to the manufacturer's instructions. One h before transfection, cells were placed in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium lacking antibiotics and supplemented with 1% l-glutamine, 1% non-essential amino acids, and 10% fetal bovine serum. After 4-6 h with DNA-Lipofectamine 2000, the culture medium was changed to RPMI 1640. Cells were used for optical investigation 24-36 h after transfection. Chromaffin cells were isolated and cultured from bovine adrenal glands using divalent metal ion-free rinse, collagenase digestion, and gradient centrifugation as described previously (47Li Q. Ho C.S. Marinescu V. Bhatti H. Bokoch G.M. Ernst S.A. Holz R.W. Stuenkel E.L. J. Physiol. 2003; 550: 431-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Cells were cultured and transfected in 35-mm culture dishes and replated onto collagen-coated glass coverslips 4 h before imaging. Chromaffin cells were transfected using biolistic particle bombardment (gene gun, Bio-Rad) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Immunocytochemistry—HEK293-S3 cells cultured on coverslips were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in physiological saline solution (PSS) for 20 min, rinsed with PSS, and quenched with 50 mm NH4Cl-PSS for 12 min. PSS contained 145 mm NaCl, 5.6 mm KCl, 5.6 mm glucose, 0.5 mm MgCl2, 2.2 mm CaCl2, and 15 mm HEPES (pH 7.4). After rinsing with PSS, cells were permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100 in PSS containing 2% normal goat serum for 20 min and then incubated sequentially with Munc18-1 or syntaxin1A mouse monoclonal antibody (1:400 to 1:800 dilution) for 2 h and with Alexa Fluor-488 goat anti-mouse secondary antibody (1:200 dilution) for 1 h. After rinsing, coverslips were mounted on glass slides with 75% glycerol-PSS. The Golgi marker GS27 was localized in HEK293-S3 cells using a mouse monoclonal antibody (1:200 dilution) and Cy5-conjugated anti-mouse secondary antibody (1:200 dilution). Digital fluorescence images from HEK293-S3 and chromaffin cells were viewed with either an Olympus fluorescence microscope or a Zeiss LSM 510 META confocal microscope (conventional channel mode; 488-nm argon laser line), and images were processed using Photoshop 6.0 software (Adobe Systems Inc.). Controls with no primary antibody were used to confirm the specificity of the immunochemical reactivity. Confocal Microscopy of CFP and cYFP Constructs and FRET Measurements—Cells were cultured on glass coverslips for 1-2 days after transfection. Cells were then fixed as described above and mounted on slides with 75% glycerol-PSS. Image acquisition and determination of FRET efficiency by acceptor photobleaching were obtained using the lambda mode of a Zeiss LSM 510 Meta confocal microscope and analytical software. Briefly, control emission spectra from cells expressing CFP or cYFP fusion proteins alone were obtained with the Meta system, using the 458- and 514-nm laser lines of the argon laser, respectively. The Meta instrumentation uses an optical grating to record emission spectra (10-nm increments) by projecting the emission on 32 channels of the Meta detector. These reference spectra were used to apply pixel-by-pixel linear unmixing calculations (Meta software) to completely decompose or digitally separate the contribution of cYFP-S1A and CFP-M18 in the mixed emission spectrum recorded from cotransfected cells, thereby producing unmixed CFP and cYFP images. The effectiveness of the linear unmixing algorithm was validated using cells that highly overexpressed CFP alone and cYFP alone. After linear unmixing, no cellular fluorescence was found in the YFP channel for cells expressing CFP or in the CFP channel for cells expressing cYFP, even when post-image acquisition contrast settings were boosted to high levels. For measurement of FRET efficiency at the plasma membrane by the acceptor photobleach method, a mixed spectral image (2-μm optical section) of cotransfected cells was collected, and an area of the plasma membrane was then selected for photobleaching of cYFP. A protocol was then used which recorded pre- and post-bleach images using 458-nm excitation, with an intermediate bleach of the selected area with the 514 laser (acceptor bleach). FRET was resolved as an increase in the CFP (donor) signal after photobleaching of cYFP (acceptor). CFP and cYFP digital images were subsequently generated after linear unmixing as described above. Reduction of the cYFP signal after photobleaching for CFP-Munc18-1 and cYFP-syntaxin1A cotransfected HEK293-S3 cells was on average 87 ± 1.1% (n = 37). For determination of FRET efficiency for the plasma membrane region in the selected bleach area, the average pixel intensity (I) of the CFP signal was determined from the unmixed pre- and post-bleach images using Zeiss software. Relative FRET efficiency was calculated as (1 - [CFP Ipre-bleach/CFP Ipost-bleach]) × 100%. For control purposes, an area of the plasma membrane that was not photobleached was also analyzed for FRET. Application of the photobleach protocol on CFP-only expressing cells, followed by application of the linear unmixing algorithm for CFP + cYFP signals, demonstrated an apparent 9.5 ± 1.9% (n = 13) increase in CFP signal that was not subtracted from the FRET efficiency values reported. The cause of the change in CFP upon photobleach remains undetermined, although one possibility is a small consistent photoactivation by the 514-nm bleach. This effect on CFP, together with somewhat less than complete bleach of all acceptors and variation in CFP/cYFP ratios in cotransfected cells, may impact FRET efficiency positively and/or negatively. Therefore, the FRET values reported by acceptor photobleach are relative estimates that serve to confirm FRET data from a filter-based approach while providing the advantage of high spatial resolution. Digital images were exported to Photoshop 6.0 for photographic processing. For experiments with HEK293-S3 cells in which the Golgi marker GS27 was localized together with CFP-Munc18-1 and cYFP-syntaxin1A, the channel mode of the Zeiss confocal was first used to record Cy5 immunofluorescence of GS27 (HeNe2 633-nm laser line, 644-725-nm emission filter), followed by capture of CFP and cYFP fluorescence in the lambda mode, linear unmixing, and calculation of FRET efficiency as described above. Measurement of FRET Stoichiometry by Sensitized Emission on a Conventional Fluorescence Microscope—FRET imaging was performed on transfected cells 24-36 h after transfection. The microscope consisted of an inverted fluorescence microscope (Olympus, IX71) interfaced to a TILL-Photonics Polychrome IV xenon lamp-based monochrometer (Till-Photonics, Grafelfing, Germany), a"
https://openalex.org/W1986725865,"Activation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) plays a central role in cellular responses to a multitude of stress signals. In the heart, enhanced p38 MAPK signaling has been implicated in cardiac hypoxic and ischemic injury. However, the mechanism underlying hypoxia-induced p38 MAPK activation remains elusive. We investigated p38 MAPK activation during hypoxia in adult rat cardiomyocytes. Here, we reported that hypoxia leads to concurrent intracellular acidosis and activation of p38 MAPK and that the hypoxia-induced p38 MAPK signaling can be fully abolished by neutralizing intracellular pH, whereas intracellular acidosis (intracellular pH<7.0) per se overtly augments activation of p38 MAPK but not ERK1/2 and JNK. Furthermore, inhibition of p38 MAPK protects myocytes against hypoxic cell death, suggesting that acidosis-evoked p38 MAPK signaling plays an important role in hypoxic cell injury and cell death. These results demonstrate, for the first time, that intracellular acidosis constitutes a necessary and sufficient link responsible for hypoxia-activated p38 MAPK signaling and the subsequent hypoxic cardiomyocyte injury and death."

DBP is a member of the albumin (ALB), α-fetoprotein (AFP), and α-albumin/afamin (AFM) gene family and thus has the characteristic multiple disulfide-bonded, triple domain modular structure (1White P.

Besides functioning as a circulating vitamin D transport protein, it has been demonstrated that plasma DBP effectively scavenges G-actin released at sites of necrotic cell death and prevents polymerization of actin in the circulation (1White P.

C5a is a very potent chemotactic factor for all leukocytes as well as several other cell types, and the peptide has several other proinflammatory functions as well (10Kohl J. Mol.

The mechanisms by which DBP acts as a chemotactic cofactor for C5a are not known. The goal of this study was to determine whether a cochemotactic region could be located within DBP. The results demonstrate for the first time that DBP enhances both C5a-mediated chemotaxis and Ca2+ influx in differentiated HL-60 cells. In addition, a 20-amino-acid sequence within the N-terminal domain I of DBP (residues 130–149) was found to possess the C5a chemotactic cofactor activity. Reagents—Recombinant C5a was purchased from Sigma. Purified human DBP was obtained from Biodesign International (Kennebunkport, ME). Full-length human DBP cDNA (Gc-2 allele), clone number CS0DM004YF02, was purchased from Invitrogen. DNA restriction and modification enzymes were purchased from New England Biolabs (Beverley, MA). Oligonucleotides were synthesized by Invitrogen. Anti-human DBP was purchased from DiaSorin, (Stillwater, MN). pGEX-4T-2 expression vector was purchased from Amersham Biosciences. Dibutyryl-cAMP (Bt2cAMP), Me2SO, and protease inhibitor mixture were obtained from Sigma. Complement-activated serum using yeast cell walls (zymosan A) was prepared as described previously (20Trujillo G. Kew R.R. J. Immunol. 2004; 173: 4130-4136Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). DBP-derived peptides, peptide 1 (residues 130–152, EAFRKDPKEYANQFMWEYSTNYG) and peptide 2 (residues 150–172, NYGQAPLSLLVSYTKSYLSMVGS), were synthesized and purified (>95% purity) by the American Peptide Company, Inc. (Sunnyvale, CA). Cells and Cell Culture—Human promyelocytic cell line HL-60 was obtained from ATCC (Rockville, MD) and cultured in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Differentiation of HL-60 cells was initiated with 250 μm Bt2cAMP for 48 h. Construction of Full-length and Truncated Recombinant Expressed DBP (reDBP)—To construct GST fusion proteins, DNA sequences corresponding to the indicated regions of full-length human DBP or DBP domains were amplified by PCR, designed to generate products with 5′ BamHI and the 3′ XhoI restriction site. The Escherichia coli-expressed proteins were designated as follows: full-length reDBP (residues 1–458), DBP domains I and II (residues 1–378), DBP domains II and III (residues 192–458), DBP domain I (residues 1–191), DBP domain II (residues 192–378), DBP domain III (residues 379–458) were cloned into the corresponding site using pGEX-4T-2 expression plasmid as GST fusion partners in E. coli (sequences of all primers available from the authors upon request). E. coli strain XL-1 Blue (Stratagene, CA) served as host for DNA manipulation, and the E. coli strain BL-21 served the host for protein expression. Truncated versions of domain I (residues 1–175, 1–150, 1–125, and 1–112) also were expressed in E. coli as described above. Each construct was confirmed by DNA sequencing. Expression and Purification of Full-length and Truncated reDBP— DBP was expressed in E. coli according to the protocol described by Swamy et al. (21Swamy N. Ghosh S. Ray R. Protein Expression Purif. 1997; 10: 115-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). BL21 cells carrying pGEX-4T-2 plasmids expressed fusion protein GST linked to the DBP constructs. E. coli were grown at room temperature (22–24 °C) in Luria broth (LB) containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin and 50 μg/ml chloramphenicol until absorbance at 600 nm (A600) was 0.4–0.6. The expression of fusion proteins was induced by the addition of 0.5–1.0 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 4–8 h. Cells were collected by centrifugation at 5000 × g. The E. coli pellets (from 1 liter) were resuspended in 40 ml of Tris-buffered saline (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.3, 150 mm NaCl) containing 0.2 mg/ml lysozyme, 0.1% Triton X-100, and 2 ml of a protease inhibitor mixture. The cells were disrupted by sonication, and insoluble material was removed by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 20 min. The detergent-soluble cell lysate containing the expressed fusion protein was mixed with 1 ml of a 50% slurry of glutathione-agarose, preequilibrated in Tris-buffered saline. After several washes with Tris-buffered saline, the bound GST·DBP was eluted with 20 mm oxidized glutathione in 100 mm Tris buffer, pH 8.3. Fusion protein was cleaved with thrombin and dialyzed against PBS to remove oxidized glutathione, and GST was separated from reDBP using a glutathione-Sepharose affinity column. Sequencing fidelities of the reDBPs were confirmed by N-terminal sequencing. Vitamin D3 Binding Assay—Competitive binding assays of natural DBP full-length and truncated reDBP with [3H]25-OH-D3 were carried out according to a published procedure with minor modifications (5Swamy N. Dutta A. Ray R. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 7432-7436Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). In a typical experiment, solutions containing natural DBP, reDBP (200 ng), [3H]25-OH-D3 (0.1 pmol), 25-OH-D3 (0.5–64 pmol) in 10 μl with 490 μl of assay buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.3, 150 mm sodium chloride, 1.5 mm EDTA, 0.1% Triton X-100) were incubated at 4 °C for 20 h followed by treatment with 100 μl of 2.5% ice-cold dextran-coated charcoal and centrifugation at 5000 × g at 4 °C. Clear supernatants from the centrifuged samples were mixed with the scintillation mixture and counted for radioactivity. Each sample was assayed in triplicate. Ligand-induced Calcium Mobilization—Calcium mobilization studies were performed using the Fluo-3 AM probe as described previously (22Merritt J.E. McCarthy S.A. Davies M.P. Moores K.E. Biochem. J. 1990; 269: 513-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). Differentiated HL-60 cells (1 × 107 cells/ml) were resuspended in HBSS, 1% BSA containing 2 μm Fluo-3 AM (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) and incubated at 37 °C for 40 min. Cells incubated without the dye were used as a control to measure autofluorescence (Fmin). Following the dye uptake, cells were washed twice and then suspended at 5 × 106 cells/ml in HBSS containing 1% BSA. Half of the cell suspension was treated with 50 nm DBP for 30 min at room temperature, and the other half served as the untreated control. For each measurement, 400 μl of cell suspension (with or without DBP) was added to a cuvette and stimulated with various concentrations of purified C5a at room temperature (22–24 °C). Fluorescence was then measured immediately using a PerkinElmer Life Sciences LS-5 fluorometer at 505-nm excitation, 526-nm emission for Fluo-3 AM. Fmax was measured by treating labeled cells with 60 μm digitonin. Intracellular free calcium concentrations were calculated using the following formula: (Ca2+) = Kd (F – Fmin)/(Fmax – F), where Kd = 325 nm for Fluo-3 according to the manufacturer (Molecular Probes). Chemotaxis Assay—Chemotaxis was performed as described previously (23Kew R.R. Mollison K.W. Webster R.O. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1995; 58: 55-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). In brief, 35 μl of C5a (0.01–1 nm) in the chemotaxis buffer (HBSS with 1% BSA, 10 mm HEPES) was placed in duplicate in the lower chamber of a 48-well chamber (Neuroprobe, Gaithersburg, MD). The lower compartments were covered with a 5-μm pore cellulose nitrate filter, and then 50 μl of the cell suspension (2.5 × 105/well) was pipetted into the upper compartments. The chemotactic chamber was incubated for 1 h at 37° in a humidified incubator with 5% CO2. Following incubation, the filter was fixed, stained, and mounted on a microscope slide. Cell movement was measured as the distance in microns that the leading front of the cells had migrated into the filter (24Zigmond S. Hirsch J. J. Exp. Med. 1973; 137: 387Crossref PubMed Scopus (1280) Google Scholar). Data Analysis and Statistics—Results of several experiments were analyzed for significant differences among group means using analysis of variance followed by Newman-Keul's multiple comparisons post-test utilizing the statistical software program InStat (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA). DBP Enhances C5a-induced Chemotaxis and Ca2+Influx in Differentiated HL-60 Cells—Previous published work in our laboratory has demonstrated that neutrophils co-incubated with DBP display significant increased movement to suboptimal concentrations (10–100 pm) of C5a, i.e. the cochemotactic effect (12Kew R.R. Webster R.O. J. Clin. Investig. 1988; 82: 364-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 23Kew R.R. Mollison K.W. Webster R.O. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1995; 58: 55-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 25Kew R.R. Fisher J.A. Webster R.O. J. Immunol. 1995; 155: 5369-5374PubMed Google Scholar). However, neutrophils are short-lived, terminally differentiated cells and cannot be genetically manipulated. A cell culture model for neutrophils is the promyelocytic cell line HL-60 that can be induced to differentiate into neutrophil-like cells using agents such as Me2SO or Bt2cAMP. Differentiation of HL-60 cells for 48 h using 250 μm Bt2cAMP induced expression of the C5a receptor and both permitted chemotaxis to C5a alone and significantly enhanced movement to C5a in the presence of purified natural DBP (Fig. 1A). These results are consistent with our previous reports using neutrophils and indicate that differentiated HL-60 cells will serve as a good cell culture model to investigate the cochemotactic function of DBP. Intracellular calcium mobilization is a rapid and well characterized event in response to C5a binding to its receptor. Fig. 1B shows that cells pretreated with DBP for 30 min display a significantly enhanced intracellular calcium influx in response to C5a. In contrast, untreated cells that had DBP and C5a added simultaneously did not show augmented calcium influx (data not shown), supporting previous studies showing that DBP needs to bind to the cell surface for at least 15 min before enhanced chemotaxis is observed (25Kew R.R. Fisher J.A. Webster R.O. J. Immunol. 1995; 155: 5369-5374PubMed Google Scholar). Nevertheless, the results presented in Fig. 1 show that DBP can enhance C5a-induced chemotaxis and calcium mobilization in differentiated HL-60 cells and indicate that this cell line will serve as a good cell culture model to investigate the cochemotactic function of DBP. Analysis of E. coli-expressed DBP by SDS-PAGE and Western Blotting—The commercially available (Invitrogen) 1374-nucleotide DBP cDNA, Gc2 allele, was expressed in E. coli BL-21 in the plasmid vector pGEX-4T-2 fused to GST. Upon isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside induction, the GST·DBP fusion protein was expressed, as judged by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 2A). SDS-PAGE of the elution protein revealed an ∼80-kDa band corresponding to the molecular mass of full-length DBP fused to GST. The bands at ∼65, 55, and 45 kDa correspond to the molecular mass of GST with truncated forms of DBP. All lanes have a small amount of a 30-kDa band. This probably represents a degradation product of GST or the unfinished product of the protein synthesis. Thrombin cleavage of the purified fusion protein resulted in separation of GST from DBP. The SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting after cleavage and separation of GST revealed a single protein band of 56 kDa for full-length DBP, 40 kDa for domains I and II, 30 kDa for domains II and III, and 20 kDa for domain I or domain II (Fig. 2B). Functional Characterization of reDBP—The capacity of reDBP to bind 25(OH)-vitamin D3 was measured to determine whether the expressed proteins could functionally bind a physiological ligand. Competitive binding assays of reDBP with a fixed amount of [3H]25(OH)-D3 and various amounts of unlabeled 25(OH)-D3 demonstrate that all reDBP could displace the radiolabel in a similar dose-dependent manner (Fig. 3), indicating that the vitamin D sterol binding site of the reDBPs is similar to the purified, natural DBP. In addition, full-length reDBP-bound G-actin in a 1:1 molar complex as detected by non-denaturing PAGE (data not shown). The ability of reDBPs to enhance C5a-mediated chemotaxis and Ca2+ flux in differentiated HL-60 cells was determined next. Fig. 4 demonstrates that reDBPs containing the N-terminal domain I have the capacity to enhance chemotaxis (Fig. 4A) and intracellular Ca2+ flux (Fig. 4B) in response to a C5a stimulus. Cells treated with DBP alone showed no response (data not shown). In addition, undifferentiated HL-60 cells, which express very little C5a receptor, did not react to C5a or C5a plus DBP (data not shown).Fig. 4Effect of reDBP on C5a-mediated responses in differentiated HL-60 cells. HL-60 cells were differentiated using 250 μm bt2cAMP for 48 h. A, cells (6 × 106/ml) were resuspended in chemotaxis buffer and allowed to respond to 100 pm C5a alone (Control) or C5a plus 50 nm each indicated DBP for 60 min at 37 °C. Numbers represent net cell movement in 60 min, mean ± S.E. of 3–5 experiments. B, cells loaded with Fluo-3 AM dye were resuspended in HBSS + 1% BSA at 5 × 106/ml with or without 50 nm indicated DBP and then incubated at room temperature for 30 min. The increase in intracellular calcium after stimulation with 100 pm C5a was then measured. Data are expressed as the maximal nm change in the intracellular Ca2+ level. Results are the mean ± S.E. of 3 separate experiments. Asterisks denote that the sample is significantly greater (p < 0.01) than control value.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Previous results clearly demonstrate that the C5a cochemotactic function of DBP resides in the N-terminal domain. Therefore, to identify the cochemotactic sequence within this region, a series of truncated versions of domain I were generated. Initially, constructs containing either the N-terminal (amino acids 1–112) or C-terminal half (amino acids 113–191) of domain I were produced. The recombinant protein representing the N-terminal half of domain I-(1–112) was expressed and purified but possessed no chemotactic enhancing activity for C5a (Figs. 5 and 6). Several attempts to express the C-terminal half of domain I-(113–191) in E. coli, however, failed repeatedly (data not shown). The alternative approach of generating C-terminal truncations of domain I was employed next. Full-length domain I-(1–191) was progressively truncated to residues 1–112 since this protein had no chemotactic enhancing activity. Fig. 5 shows the analysis of domain I truncations by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 5A) and immunoblotting (Fig. 5B). Fig. 6 demonstrates that domain I truncations 1–112 and 1–125 lack enhancing activity, whereas truncations 1–150 and 1–175 possess almost the same level of activity as full-length natural DBP for both chemotaxis (Fig. 6A) and Ca2+ flux (Fig. 6B).Fig. 6Effect of truncated reDBP of domain I on C5a-mediated responses in differentiated HL-60 cells. HL-60 cells were differentiated using 250 μm bt2cAMP for 48 h. A, cells (6 × 106/ml) were resuspended in chemotaxis buffer allowed to respond to 100 pm C5a alone (Control) or C5a plus 50 nm each indicated DBP for 60 min at 37 °C. Numbers represent net cell movement in 60 min, mean ± S.E. of 3–5 experiments. B, cells loaded with Fluo-3 AM dye were resuspended in HBSS + 1% BSA at 5 × 106/ml with or without 50 nm indicated DBP and then incubated at room temperature for 30 min. The increase in intracellular calcium after stimulation with 100 pm C5a was then measured. Data are expressed as the maximal nm change in the intracellular Ca2+ level. Results are the mean ± S.E. of 3 separate experiments. Asterisks denote that the sample is significantly greater (p < 0.01) than control value.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The results from Fig. 6 indicate that a region within domain I of DBP, from amino acids 126 to 175, confers the C5a cochemotactic function. Two overlapping peptides within this region of DBP were next synthesized to determine more precisely a cochemotactic sequence. Peptide 1 (residues 130–152, EAFRKDPKEYANQFMWEYSTNYG) and peptide 2 (residues 150–172, NYGQAPLSLLVSYTKSYLSMVGS), by themselves or mixed together, could not enhance C5a-mediated chemotaxis (data not shown). Consequently, an alternative approach of using these peptides to block the cochemotactic function of full-length natural DBP by pretreating cells with each peptide was employed. The results from Fig. 7 clearly show that peptide 1-(130–152), but not peptide 2-(150–172), could completely block the cochemotactic function of purified full-length natural DBP (C5a + DBP). In addition, peptide 1-(130–152) also could eliminate the HL-60 cell chemotactic response to complement-activated serum, indicating that this peptide can function to block a potent chemotactic signal in a diverse protein mixture (Fig. 7). This study describes several novel findings. It is the first report of differentiated HL-60 cells displaying increased C5a-mediated chemotaxis to DBP, the first report of a DBP-mediated enhancement of C5a-induced Ca2+ influx in any cell type, and the first report to identify a sequence in DBP that mediates the C5a chemotactic cofactor function. Differentiated HL-60 cells are the second myeloid cell line to show enhanced C5a chemotaxis to DBP. Recently, we have demonstrated that undifferentiated U937 cells transfected with the C5a receptor can also be utilized as a cell culture model to investigate the cochemotactic function of DBP (20Trujillo G. Kew R.R. J. Immunol. 2004; 173: 4130-4136Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Both cell lines will be useful to further elucidate the mechanisms by which DBP augments chemotaxis to C5a. In addition, the demonstration of a DBP-mediated increase in calcium flux to C5a is particularly important because it will permit dissection of intracellular signaling pathways triggered by DBP bound to the cell surface. It is interesting to note that HL-60 cells needed to be pretreated with purified DBP for at least 15 min prior to C5a addition to detect an increased calcium signal (Fig. 1B), perhaps indicating the formation of a DBP signaling complex on the plasma membrane as suggested previously (20Trujillo G. Kew R.R. J. Immunol. 2004; 173: 4130-4136Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). However, the major finding in this report is the identification of a 20-amino-acid sequence in the N-terminal domain of DBP that blocks C5a cochemotaxis to full-length natural DBP. DBP contains 14 disulfide bonds and, therefore, presents a challenge for expressing the protein in a functional form. Swamy et al. (21Swamy N. Ghosh S. Ray R. Protein Expression Purif. 1997; 10: 115-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar) previously reported expression of functional recombinant DBP in E. coli using GST as a fusion partner. Using their approach, we generated a series of functional truncated proteins that localized the C5a cochemotactic function to a 50-amino-acid region (residues 126–175) in the C-terminal portion of domain I. Two overlapping peptides covering this region were synthesized and clearly demonstrated that the cochemotactic function was confined to the 20-amino-acid sequence 5′-EAFRKDPKEYANQFMWEYST-3′ (residues 130–149). This sequence is identical among the three major allelic forms of human DBP (Gc-1F, Gc-1S, Gc-2) and correlates with the fact that there is no difference in the C5a cochemotactic function between these DBP isoforms (16Binder R. Kress A. Kan G. Herrmann K. Kirschfink M. Mol. Immunol. 1999; 36: 885-892Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). BLAST search of this sequence produced no other match, besides DBP, in any eukaryote, indicating that this region is unique to DBP and that it probably does not function by mimicking a similar sequence in a signaling molecule. In addition, alignment of this human peptide with the corresponding sequences in rat (26Cooke N.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 3441-3450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), mouse (27Yang F. Bergeron J.M. Linehan L.A. Lalley P.A. Sakaguchi A.Y. Bowman B.H. Genomics. 1990; 7: 509-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), and rabbit DBP (28Osawa M. Tsuji T. Yukawa N. Saito T. Takeichi S. Biochem. Mol. Biol. Int. 1994; 34: 1003-1009PubMed Google Scholar), the only other mammalian sequences currently described, show a very high degree of amino acid similarity; 78% of the residues are identical, and the remainder are conservative or homologous substitutions. Thus, it is reasonable to speculate that this region in domain I of DBP functions as the cochemotactic sequence in all mammals. Several recent reports have described the crystal structure of DBP, either unligated or bound to G-actin or vitamin D (6Verboven C. Rabijns A. De Maeyer M. Van Baelen H. Bouillon R. De Ranter C. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2002; 9: 131-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 7Swamy N. Head J.F. Weitz D. Ray R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2002; 402: 14-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 8Head J.F. Swamy N. Ray R. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 9015-9020Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 9Otterbein L.R. Cosio C. Graceffa P. Dominguez R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 8003-8008Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Analysis of the structure has revealed that the protein is comprised of a series of α-helices, much like albumin (29He X.M. Carter D.C. Nature. 1992; 358: 209-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (3506) Google Scholar), but in contrast to albumin, DBP folds into a hook-like structure that serves as the G-actin binding site (30Mizwicki M.T. Norman A.W. J. Bone Miner. Res. 2003; 18: 795-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The cochemotactic sequence in DBP (residues 130–149) is located partly in α-helix number 7 (residues 125–134) but mostly in α-helix number 8 (residues 136–150) in domain I (6Verboven C. Rabijns A. De Maeyer M. Van Baelen H. Bouillon R. De Ranter C. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2002; 9: 131-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 7Swamy N. Head J.F. Weitz D. Ray R. Arch. Biochem.

Graceffa P. Dominguez R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 8003-8008Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Three-dimensional analysis of DBP crystal structure using the NIH NCBI software program Cn3D (version 4.1) indicates that this region is not blocked when DBP binds G-actin or vitamin D sterols and is accessible to interact with cells. This structural analysis correlates well with our recent functional studies that demonstrated that ligation of DBP with G-actin, 25-OH vitamin D3, or both did not alter the C5a cochemotactic activity of DBP. 2A. B. Shah, S. J. Dimartino, G. Trujillo, and R. R. Kew, manuscript submitted. Therefore, this cochemotactic peptide is a distinct functional sequence and constitutes the forth such region (the others are G-actin, vitamin D, and the polysaccharide structure of DBP-MAF (macrophage-activating factor) to be defined in the plieotropic DBP. The binding of DBP to cells is required for the protein to mediate its numerous functions: a chemotactic cofactor for C5a, a macrophage or osteoclast-activating factor, clearance of DBP-actin complexes by the liver, and delivery of vitamin D sterols and free fatty acids to cells (1White P. Cooke N. Trends Endocrinol. Metab. 2000; 11: 320-327Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar, 2Gomme P.T. Bertolini J. Trends Biotechnol. 2004; 22: 340-345Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). The cell surface DBP binding site is only partially characterized, but this essential link in DBP physiology is poorly understood. DBP appears to bind with relatively low affinity to multiple cell surface ligands including chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans (31DiMartino S.J. Kew R.R. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 2135-2142PubMed Google Scholar), low density lipoprotein receptor family members megalin and cubulin (32Nykjaer A. Dragun D. Walther D. Vorum H. Jacobsen C. Herz J. Melsen F.

Cancer Inst. 2002; 94: 1311-1319Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Recently, we have shown that the platelet-derived adhesive glycoprotein thrombospondin-1 (a known ligand for CD36) is required for the full C5a cochemotactic activity of DBP and may be involved in the formation or regulation of the putative DBP binding site complex (20Trujillo G. Kew R.R. J. Immunol. 2004; 173: 4130-4136Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The results presented in this report do not answer the question of whether there is a distinct cell binding and cochemotactic region in DBP or whether the sequence identified (residues 130–149) performs both functions. DBP has been shown to bind to chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans, and this protein has several glycosaminoglycan consensus binding sequences (K/R-rich regions) in domains II and III. In particular, an 11-amino-acid sequence (403–413) in domain III (5′-KKKLAERLKAK-3′) is a very basic region that may be a putative glycosaminoglycan binding site. However, the cell binding site on DBP remains to be identified. The results also do not preclude the possibility that there are other sequences in DBP that may be involved in its cochemotactic function. The cochemotactic sequence 5′-EAFRKDPKEYANQFMWEYST-3′ (residues 130–149) can effectively block the capacity of full-length natural DBP to enhance chemotaxis to C5a, but the sequence alone cannot augment chemotaxis, possibly suggesting that other regions of DBP may be involved in this function. Nevertheless, the results reported herein provide strong evidence that amino acids 130–149 play an essential role in the C5a chemotactic cofactor function of DBP and, furthermore, could signify that compounds derived from this sequence may have therapeutic potential to limit C5a-mediated tissue injury."

Here, we report a physical and functional interaction between the Cdk5/p35 complex and mouse Sds3 (mSds3), an essential component of mSin3-histone deacetylase (HDAC) co-repressor complex. mSds3 binds to p35 both in vitro and in vivo, enabling active Cdk5 to phosphorylate mSds3 at serine 228. A mSds3 S228A mutant retained mSin3 binding activity, but its dimerization was not greatly enhanced by p35 when compared with wild type. Notably, p35 overexpression augmented mSds3-mediated transcriptional repression in vitro. Interestingly, mutational studies revealed that the ability of exogenous mSds3 to rescue cell growth and viability in mSds3 null cells correlates with its ability to be phosphorylated by Cdk5. The identification of mSds3 as a substrate of the Cdk5/p35 complex reveals a new regulatory mechanism in controlling the mSin3-HDAC transcriptional repressor activity and provides a new potential therapeutic means to inhibit specific HDAC activities in disease.

A mSds3 S228A mutant retained mSin3 binding activity, but its dimerization was not greatly enhanced by p35 when compared with wild type. Notably, p35 overexpression augmented mSds3-mediated transcriptional repression in vitro. Interestingly, mutational studies revealed that the ability of exogenous mSds3 to rescue cell growth and viability in mSds3 null cells correlates with its ability to be phosphorylated by Cdk5. The identification of mSds3 as a substrate of the Cdk5/p35 complex reveals a new regulatory mechanism in controlling the mSin3-HDAC transcriptional repressor activity and provides a new potential therapeutic means to inhibit specific HDAC activities in disease.

Beaudette K. Litwin C.M.E. Wang J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13383-13390Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast to classical Cdks, which depend on cyclins for activation, Cdk5 activation requires association with its neuron-enriched regulator, p35 or p39 (2Dhavan R. Tsai L.H. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 749-759Crossref PubMed Scopus (931) Google Scholar). Although Cdk5 expression is ubiquitous in mammalian tissues, the expression of its activators is largely restricted to neurons. Therefore, the temporal and spatial specificity of Cdk5 kinase activity is due to the neuronal expression of p35 and p39 (3Ishiguro K. Kobayashi S. Omore A. Takamatsu M. Yonekura S. Anzai K.

During the last decade, significant advances have been made in understanding the functions of Cdk5 partly due to the identification and characterization of the substrates for Cdk5. To date, more than 30 substrates have been identified for Cdk5 and the functional roles of their interactions with Cdk5 have been explored (2Dhavan R. Tsai L.H. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell.

By phosphorylating these diverse cellular targets, Cdk5 plays a multifunctional role in neurons including neurite outgrowth, axonal guidance, cytoskeleton assembly, membrane transport, synaptic function, dopamine signaling, and drug addiction (2Dhavan R.

Recent studies have revealed an important role of Cdk5 in regulating gene expression in various cell types such as the expression of acetylcholine receptors in skeletal muscle and the expression of insulin in pancreatic β-islet cells (16Fu A.K.Y.

Both Cdk5 and p35 could be detected in the nucleus, albeit at a much lower level (19Qu D. Li Q. Lim H-Y. Cheung N.S. Li R. Wang J.H. Qi R.Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 7324-7332Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 20Fu A.K.Y. Fu W.Y. Ng A.K.Y. Chien W.W.Y. Ng Y.P. Wang J.H. Ip N.Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 6728-6733Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Although it is not clear whether Cdk5/p35 acts on the nuclear machinery to regulate gene transcription, accumulating evidence indicates that a number of transcription factors can serve as the substrates of Cdk5. For example, Cdk5-directed phosphorylation of retinoblastoma and p53 can modulate their activities and influence apoptotic processes (21Lee K.Y. Helbing C.C. Choi K.S. Johnston R.N. Wang J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5622-5626Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 22Zhang J. Krishnamurthy P.K. Johnson G.V.W. J. Neurochemistry. 2002; 81: 307-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Similarly, Cdk5-dependent phosphorylation of the transcription factor myocyte enhancer factor-2 leads to the inhibition of its prosurvival functions and also engenders apoptosis (23Gong X. Tang X. Wiedmann M. Wang X. Peng J. Zheng D. Blair L.A.C. Marshall J. Mao Z. Neuron. 2003; 38: 33-46Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). The Cdk5 complex can also phosphorylate STAT3 and modulate its transcriptional activity (20Fu A.K.Y. Fu W.Y. Ng A.K.Y. Chien W.W.Y. Ng Y.P. Wang J.H. Ip N.Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 6728-6733Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Finally, SET protein, a chromatin-remodeling factor, serves as a substrate for Cdk5 and binds the core histones, protecting it from acetylation by different histone acetyltransferases (19Qu D. Li Q.

Taken together, these studies support the view that Cdk5/p35-directed phosphorylation plays a pivotal regulatory role capable of modulating the activity of numerous signaling and transcriptional molecules governing diverse cellular processes. In this study, a yeast two-hybrid screen revealed an unanticipated interaction between p35 and mouse Sds3 (mSds3), an essential component of the mSin3-histone deacetylase (HDAC) complex that is conserved from yeast to human (26Alland L. David G. Shen-Li H. Potes J. Mihle R. Lee H-C. Hou H. Chen L. Depinho R.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 2743-2750Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). mSds3 associates with mSin3A co-repressor with high stoichiometry (27Fleischer T.C. Yun U.J. Ayer D.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 3456-3467Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). mSds3 represses transcription in part through its capacity to recruit HDAC activity in an mSin3-dependent manner and appears to function as an essential cofactor in the maintenance of mSin3-associated HDAC activity, a function conserved in yeast and mammalian cells (26Alland L. David G. Shen-Li H. Potes J. Mihle R. Lee H-C. Hou H. Chen L. Depinho R.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 2743-2750Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 28Lechner T. Carrozza M.J. Yu Y. Grant P.A.

Recent studies have shown that genetic inactivation of mSds3 in the mouse generates a cell-lethal condition characterized by severe proliferation defects, increased apoptosis, and impaired chromosome segregation, leading to rampant aneuploidy (29David G. Turner G.M. Yao Y. Protopopov A. DePinho R.A. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 2396-2405Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). In this study, we provide evidence that mSds3 interacts with p35 enabling Cdk5/p35-directed phosphorylation of mSds3 serine 228. This mSds3 phosphorylation residue appears critical in mSds3-mediated transcriptional repression and in the rescue of the mSds3 null phenotype. The identification of mSds3 as a Cdk5 substrate reveals a novel role for Cdk5 in the regulation of mSds3-directed activities including transcriptional regulation. Plasmids and Antibodies—Complementary DNA (cDNA) encoding full-length p35 was subcloned into the yeast GAL4 DNA-binding vector, pAS2–1 (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA), to construct GAL4bd-p35, which was used as bait in the yeast two-hybrid screen. Similarly, the cDNAs encoding p25 and p10 were subcloned into pAS2–1. Partial cDNA fragments of mSds3 (encoding amino acids 1–170, 171–328, or 59–170) were amplified using mouse cDNA by PCR, subcloned into GAL4 transcriptional activation vector, pACT2 (Clontech), and used in the experiment described in Fig. 1. Full-length mSds3 was subcloned into expression vector pMT21 or pcDNA3-His6 for overexpression experiments. The GST-mSds3 and His-mSds3 fusion constructs were generated by subcloning full-length mouse mSds3 into pGEX-6P-2 and pETH-32, respectively (Amersham Biosciences). Point mutations (e.g. serine 228 to alanine (S228A)) were generated by PCR using complementary primers containing the mutations and subcloned into pGEX-6P-2. All of the constructs were confirmed by sequencing. Sds3 antibody was purchased from Bethyl (Montgomery, TX), whereas antibodies specific for Cdk5, p35, HA, and His were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Yeast Two-hybrid Screen—Yeast two-hybrid screen was performed following the Matchmaker two-hybrid screen protocol (Clontech). p35 was used as a bait to screen a mouse muscle cDNA library constructed in GAL4 transcriptional activation vector (pACT2). The bait and library plasmid was transformed into yeast strain Y190. The transformants were selected on SD-Trp-Leu-His plates, and the selected clones were subjected to β-galactosidase filter assay. The Sds3 clone isolated from the two-hybrid screen encodes the full-length protein including 130 nucleotides at the 5′ end of the initiation codon. A construct without this extra sequence still interacts with p35 (data not shown), confirming that these extra nucleotides are not necessary for the interaction between p35 and Sds3. Subsequent two-hybrid interaction analyses were carried out by co-transformation of plasmids containing the GAL4 DNA-binding (pAS2–1) and activation (pACT2) domains into yeast. Cell Culture and Transfection—COS7, NIH3T3, 293T, and immortalized mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEF) cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum plus antibiotics. Transfection was performed using Lipofectamine plus (Invitrogen). Because Cdk5 is constitutively expressed in all cell types, transfection with p35 expression construct is sufficient to result in active Cdk5. Protein Extraction, Immunoprecipitation, and Western Blot Analysis—COS7 cells were lysed in lysis buffer A (20 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm NaF, 0.5% Nonidet P-40). Brain and muscle tissues were homogenized in lysis buffer B (50 mm Tris, pH 8, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 50 mm NaF, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.25% sodium deoxycholate) supplemented with various protease inhibitors. After transfection, COS7 cell lysates were extracted using lysis buffer A. 200 μg of COS7 cell lysates were incubated with the corresponding antibody (2 μg) at 4 °C overnight and then incubated with 40 μl of protein G-Sepharose at 4 °C for 1 h. The samples were washed with buffer A and resuspended in SDS sample buffer, and co-immunoprecipitated proteins were detected using Western blot analysis. In vivo co-immunoprecipitation studies using brain lysates were performed as described previously (30Cheng K. Li Z. Fu W.Y. Wang J.H. Fu A.K.Y. Ip N.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 31988-31993Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions of brain and muscle were prepared following the instruction of the manufacturer (Sigma). Fusion Protein and Pull-down Assay—GST-mSds3 was expressed in BL21 strain and purified using a glutathione-Sepharose 4B column following the instruction of manufacturer (Amersham Biosciences). His-mSds3 was purified according to the protocol of the manufacturer (Qiagen). The binding assay was carried out as described previously (30Cheng K. Li Z. Fu W.Y. Wang J.H. Fu A.K.Y. Ip N.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 31988-31993Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). For pull-down studies, 5 μg of GST or GST fusion proteins were first immobilized onto glutathione-Sepharose beads in phosphate-buffered saline supplemented with 5 μg/ml bovine serum albumin. After incubation at 4 °C with end-to-end rotation for 1 h, the beads were washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline. GST-p25 proteins were then incubated with His-mSds3, whereas GST-mSds3 was incubated with 100 μg of COS7 extracts overexpressing p35 in buffer A at 4 °C for 1 h or with P5 brain lysate at 4 °C overnight. The beads were washed 5 times with buffer A, and bound proteins were resuspended in SDS loading buffer, resolved by SDS-PAGE, and analyzed by Western blot analysis. RNA Extraction and Northern Blot Analysis—Total RNA was prepared from rat tissues by lithium chloride/urea extraction (31Fu A.K. Cheung W.M. Ip F.C. Ip N.Y. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 1999; 14: 241-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Northern blot analysis was performed as described previously (32Ip F.C.F. Glass D.J. Gies D.R. Cheung J. Lai K.O. Fu A.K.Y. Yancopoulos G.D. Ip N.Y. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 2000; 16: 661-673Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Fulllength cDNA fragment of mSds3 was used as the probe. In Vitro Phosphorylation Assay—The kinase assay was performed at 30 °C for 30 min in kinase buffer (20 mm MOPS, pH 7.4, 15 mm MgCl2, 100 μm ATP) containing 1 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP. 200 μg of His-mSds3 or GST-mSds3 fusion proteins (including wild type and the S228A mutant) were utilized as the substrates for Cdk5/p25 in the same assay. The phosphorylated proteins were separated on a SDS-PAGE and visualized by autoradiography. Reporter Assay—Reporter assays were carried out as described previously (26Alland L. David G. Shen-Li H. Potes J. Mihle R. Lee H-C. Hou H. Chen L. Depinho R.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 2743-2750Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Subconfluent NIH3T3 cells were transfected with GAL-DBD-mSds3 construct and different amounts of the p35 construct along with the luciferase reporter plasmid. Cells were lysed 48 h posttransfection and assayed for luciferase activity. Transfection efficiencies were normalized using an internal β-galactosidase control. Rescue Experiment—The rescue experiment was performed in mSds3 null fibroblasts as described previously (29David G. Turner G.M. Yao Y. Protopopov A. DePinho R.A. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 2396-2405Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Immortalized MEFs of mSds3lox/- were transduced with retrovirus encoding wild type or mutant mSds3 and infected with a retrovirus encoding Cre recombinase. The growth of each transduced cell line was compared. For each genotype, two independent cell lines were tested. Identification of mSds3 as a p35-interacting Protein—A positive clone encoding full-length mSds3 was identified from the yeast two-hybrid screen of mouse muscle cDNA library using p35 as a bait. mSds3 encodes a polypeptide of 328 amino acids containing two domains, a coiled-coil domain (amino acids 59–170), and the mSin3 interaction domain (SID, amino acids 188–226) (Fig. 1) (26Alland L. David G. Shen-Li H. Potes J. Mihle R. Lee H-C. Hou H. Chen L. Depinho R.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 2743-2750Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). To map the regions of mSds3 that interact with p35, GAL4-AD constructs containing various regions of mSds3 were generated and tested for their ability to interact with p35 in yeast. As summarized in Fig. 1, the N-terminal region of mSds3 (amino acids 1–170), but not the C-terminal region (amino acids 171–328), interacted with p35. The interaction domain of mSds3 with p35 was delimited further to amino acids 59–170, the mSds3 coiled-coil domain that enables homodimerization (26Alland L. David G. Shen-Li H. Potes J. Mihle R. Lee H-C. Hou H. Chen L. Depinho R.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 2743-2750Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). This N-terminal region of mSds3 is dispensable for the interaction with mSin3B, which has been mapped previously to the mSds3 C-terminal region (amino acids 188–226), designated SID (26Alland L. David G. Shen-Li H. Potes J. Mihle R. Lee H-C. Hou H. Chen L. Depinho R.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 2743-2750Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). To characterize further the interaction between p35 and mSds3, the N-terminal (p10) and C-terminal (p25) regions of p35 were tested for their ability to bind with mSds3. The p25 protein is a cleavage product of p35 that is a potent activator of the Cdk5 kinase yet lacks the N-terminal 100 residues present in p35, which is necessary for membrane targeting (33Patrick G. Zukerberg L. Nikolic M. Monte S.D. Dikkes P. Tsai L.H. Nature. 1999; 402: 615-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (1297) Google Scholar). mSds3 was found to interact with the p25 protein and not the p35-specific N-terminal region (Fig. 1, p10). mSds3 Interacts with p35—GST pull-down assays were performed to validate further the mSds3-p35 interaction in vitro. GST-p25 was found to bind to His-mSds3 (Fig. 2A). mSds3-p35 association was similarly documented in vitro. Recombinant mSds3, but not GST, was able to pull down p35 protein from the p35-overexpressing COS7 cells or from the normal P5 brain (Fig. 2B). To further define the mSds3-p35 interaction in mammalian cells, COS7 cells were transiently transfected with mSds3 and p35. p35 was immunoprecipitated from the cell lysate using p35 antibody, and the presence of mSds3 in the complex was detected using mSds3 antibody. We found that p35 was able to interact with mSds3 when co-transfected in the COS7 cells (Fig. 2C). Finally, anti-p35 immunoprecipitates from embryonic day 19 and adult brains contained mSds3 protein, suggesting that endogenous mSds3 interacts with p35 in vivo (Fig. 2D). mSds3 Is Prominently Expressed in Brain and Muscle—The spatial and temporal expression profiles of mSds3 in rat tissues were examined. The level of mSds3 transcript and protein remained relatively unchanged in brain during development (Fig. 3, A and B). On the other hand, mSds3 mRNA and protein levels were most abundant in developing muscle during embryonic development and had declined thereafter (Fig. 3, A and B). Consistent with our previous observation (16Fu A.K.Y. Fu W.Y. Cheung J. Tsim K.W.K. Ip F.C.F. Wang J.H. Ip N.Y. Nat. Neurosci. 2001; 4: 374-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar), the level of p35 protein in muscle was considerably lower compared with the protein level in brain and was below the detectable limit in total muscle lysate (Fig. 3B). To examine the subcellular localization of mSds3 protein, fractionation experiments were carried out. Consistent with the identification of mSds3 as an integral component of the Sin3-HDAC co-repressor complex, the protein was mainly detected in the nucleus of rat brain and muscle during different developmental stages (Fig. 3C, P2, P10, and adult (Ad)). p35 protein was detected in both nuclear and cytosolic fractions of brain (Fig. 3C) (20Fu A.K.Y. Fu W.Y. Ng A.K.Y. Chien W.W.Y. Ng Y.P. Wang J.H. Ip N.Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 6728-6733Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Interestingly, a detectable level of mSds3 was expressed in the cytoplasmic fraction of adult rat brain (Fig. 3C). Nuclear localization of mSds3 was also observed in cultured cortical neurons or C2C12 myotubes (Fig. 3D). mSds3 Is Phosphorylated by Active Cdk5—Cdk5 is a prolinedirected serine/threonine kinase, prompting in vitro kinase assays to determine whether mSds3 is a substrate for active Cdk5. As shown in Fig. 4, recombinant mSds3 was efficiently phosphorylated by purified Cdk5/p25 or Cdk5/p35 complex, an observation in line with the presence of serine 228 in the context of preferential phosphorylation consensus sequence ((S/T)PX(K/H/R)). Consistent with the capacity of Cdk5 to phosphorylate mSds3 at this site, we demonstrate that an mSds3 S228A mutant is refractory to Cdk5-directed phosphorylation (Fig. 4B), a finding suggesting that mSds3 serine 228 serves as the major phosphorylation site for Cdk5. p35 Expression Increases the Homodimerization of mSds3— We next sought to examine the impact of Ser-228 phosphorylation on mSds3 function. The presence of the phosphorylation site (serine 228) next to the SID (amino acids 188–226) raises the possibility that the phosphorylation of mSds3 could modulate its ability to bind mSin3 proteins. However, as shown in Fig. 5A, the phosphorylation-deficient mutant of mSds3 (S228A) or the phosphomimetic mutant of mSds3 (S228D) did not affect interaction with mSin3A. As a negative control, mSds3ΔSID mutant (with the deletion of SID) could not pull down mSin3A in the same assay. Furthermore, the mSds3 S228A mutant exhibited a similar ability to associate with mSin3B when compared with that of wild type mSds3 (Fig. 5B). The interaction of mSds3 with mSin3A or mSin3B was further examined in muscle and brain prepared from E18 Cdk5-deficient mice. The association between mSds3 with mSin3A or mSin3B in Cdk5-deficient muscle and brain was similar to that observed in wild type (Fig. 5C). These findings suggest that the phosphorylation of mSds3 at serine 228 does not modulate the incorporation of mSds3 into the mSin3 co-repressor complex. Since mSds3 was previously reported to homodimerize through direct protein-interaction via the coiled-coil domains, the same region responsible for its association with p35 (Fig. 1) (26Alland L. David G. Shen-Li H. Potes J. Mihle R. Lee H-C. Hou H. Chen L. Depinho R.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 2743-2750Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), we further examined whether p35 could modulate the homodimerization of mSds3. By overexpressing different epitope-tagged mSds3 with p35, we showed that the presence of p35 protein could augment the interaction between His-mSds3 and HA-mSds3 (Fig. 5D). On the other hand, Cdk5 and a closely related Cdk, Pctaire1, did not affect the ability of mSds3 to form homodimers. Notably, the dimerization of the phosphorylation-deficient mutant of mSds3 (S228A) was not greatly enhanced by p35 when compared with wild type (Fig. 5D). This finding suggests that the phosphorylation of mSds3 by active Cdk5 increases the homodimerization potential of mSds3. p35 Increases mSds3 Repressor Activity—Given the ability of mSd3 to modulate mSin3-associated histone deacetylase activity (26Alland L. David G. Shen-Li H. Potes J. Mihle R. Lee H-C. Hou H. Chen L. Depinho R.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 2743-2750Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) as well as our observation that p35-Cdk5 can phosphorylate mSds3, we investigated the possibility that p35 could regulate histone acetylation in vivo. We showed that p35 overexpression led to a significant and reproducible decrease in histone H3 acetylation (Fig. 6A), whereas Cdk5 overexpression had no effect. Although we cannot exclude the possibility that p35 overexpression might also affect other HDAC-containing complexes, this observation, together with the ability of Cdk5/p35 to phosphorylate mSds3, strongly suggests that p35 is able to modulate mSin3-associated histone deacetylase activity through mSds3 phosphorylation. To assess the consequences of p35/Cdk5 on mSds3 biological activities, we first sought to determine whether the p35 overexpression modulates mSds3-associated transcriptional repression activity. As mSds3 can repress transcription in reporter gene assays (26Alland L. David G. Shen-Li H. Potes J. Mihle R. Lee H-C. Hou H. Chen L. Depinho R.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 2743-2750Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), we assessed the impact of p35 overexpression on the transcriptional repression activity of a GAL-DBD-mSds3 fusion protein. p35 overexpression did not significantly affect the level of transcription driven by GAL-DBD alone. In contrast, p35 overexpression increased GAL-DBD-mSds3-mediated repression activity in a dose-dependant manner (Fig. 6B). These results suggest that p35 increases the repressor activity of mSds3 in the reporter assay. Phosphorylation-deficient Mutant of mSds3 Cannot Rescue the Lethality Caused by mSds3 Null Mutant—mSds3 protein expression was shown to be necessary for cell growth and survival in mouse fibroblasts (29David G. Turner G.M. Yao Y. Protopopov A. DePinho R.A. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 2396-2405Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). To examine the biological importance of the mSds3 Ser-228 residue, we assessed the capacity of various mSds3 point mutants to rescue cell growth and viability in a mSds3L/--immortalized cell line rendered null by Cre-mediated deletion of the remaining wild type mSds3 allele (29David G. Turner G.M. Yao Y. Protopopov A. DePinho R.A. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 2396-2405Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Although wild type mSds3 rescued cell growth and survival, the growth defects persisted in cells transduced with the mSds3 S228A or S228D mutants (Fig. 6C). The mSds3L/--immortalized cells failed to grow after being transduced with retroviruses encoding mSds3 mutants with poor mSin3 binding activity (mSds3ΔSID) or with point mutation at serine 228. Altogether, these results suggest that the dynamic phosphorylation of serine 228 of mSds3 is necessary for sustained cell growth and viability. Whereas the actions of Cdk5 was originally thought to be largely restricted to neuronal cells, recent emerging studies reveal its unanticipated functions in non-neuronal cells, such as regulation of apoptosis in leukemia cells and prostate cancer cells (34Sandal T. Stapnes C. Kleivdal H. Hedin L. Doskeland S.O. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 20783-20793Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 35Lin H. Juang J.L. Wang P.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 29302-29307Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Thus, whereas our study clearly assigns relevance to serine 228 phosphorylation in mSds3 function, it remains to be determined whether endogenous Cdk5 activity or an as yet unidentified kinase is responsible for this modification in MEFs and other non-neuronal cell types in vivo. This study reports the physical interaction of mSds3 and p35 as evidenced by yeast two-hybrid assays, in vitro pull-down assays, and cellular and tissue co-immunoprecipitations. The data are consistent with a model of which the Cdk5/p35 complex phosphorylates serine 228, a residue positioned in the coiled-coil domain of mSds3, thereby modulating mSds3 homodimerization and in turn affecting mSds3 function, possibly via its HDAC maintenance activity of the mSin3 co-repressor complex. Our findings provide a new avenue in exploring the molecular mechanism by which mSds3 regulates gene repression as well as cell viability. Acetylation of core histones contributes to the regulation of gene expression by conferring accessibility of the DNA template to the transcriptional machine for gene expression (36Wu J. Grunstein M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2002; 25: 619-623Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (310) Google Scholar). It is tightly controlled by histone acetyltransferase and HDAC. Acetylation by histone acetyltransferase is associated with gene activation, whereas HDAC modifies the chromatin folding and is associated with gene silencing. mSds3 is a recently identified integral component of the Sin3-HDAC complex and was reported to promote functional HDAC1 activity in the mSin3 complex (26Alland L. David G. Shen-Li H. Potes J. Mihle R. Lee H-C. Hou H. Chen L. Depinho R.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 2743-2750Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). However, the precise mechanism(s) through which mSds3 operates is not clear. When tethered to DNA, mSds3 exhibits potent transcriptional repression activity in reporter assays and this activity is only partly neutralized by the HDAC inhibitor, trichostatin A, or by deletion of the putative SID of mSds3 (26Alland L. David G. Shen-Li H. Potes J. Mihle R. Lee H-C. Hou H. Chen L. Depinho R.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 2743-2750Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Thus, it is possible that mSds3 might recruit repressive activities that are independent of class 1 HDACs. In this study, we have mapped the interacting region of mSds3 and p35 to the coiled-coil domain, which is dispensable for mSds3-Sin3 interaction. Mutation of putative Cdk5 phosphorylation site on mSds3 does not effect its association with mSin3 proteins, suggesting that Cdk5 phosphorylation of mSds3 is not necessary for the interaction of these proteins. Interestingly, mSds3 harboring the phosphorylation mutations cannot rescue the lethality caused by mSds3 null mutation. This finding suggests that this residue and, by inference, its phosphorylation play an important role in mSds3-dependent cell growth and survival. Moreover, we found that p35 can enhance the ability of mSds3 to form homodimers. This finding is consistent with the previous observation that the coiled-coil domain, which is indispensable for the interaction between p35 and mSds3, is a homodimerization interface (26Alland L. David G. Shen-Li H. Potes J. Mihle R. Lee H-C. Hou H. Chen L. Depinho R.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 2743-2750Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). However, the functional consequence of mSds3 homodimerization on its repressor activity is not clear. It is possible that mSds3 is a scaffold protein between HDAC1/2 and an as yet unidentified HDAC-activating factor or that mSds3-mediated homodimerization is essential for the functional presentation of the mSin3-associated HDAC activity. The serine 228 phosphorylation of mSds3 might be essential for this recruitment to affect the enzymatic activity of the complex and subsequent cell growth and survival. Further studies on the regulation of mSds3 phosphorylation in vivo will shed the light on the molecular mechanisms controlling the mSds3-Sin3-mediated gene repression. Although a number of proteins have been identified to associate with Cdk5/p35 (7Lim A.C.B. Qu D. Qi R.Z. Neurosignals. 2003; 12: 230-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), the majority of these proteins mediate their interaction with Cdk5 through p35, suggesting that p35 may act not only as an activator of Cdk5 but also as an adaptor to associate Cdk5 with its regulators and physiological targets. By interacting with mSds3, p35 might bring Cdk5 to close proximity to the mSds3-Sin3-HDAC1 complex, whereby Cdk5 can then phosphorylate mSds3 or other proteins of the complex and regulate its transcriptional activity. Whereas Cdk5/p35 is mainly associated with membrane or cytoskeleton, detectable Cdk5/p35 was reported in the nuclear fractions of neurons and muscle (19Qu D. Li Q. Lim H-Y. Cheung N.S. Li R.

In addition, Cdk5 is suggested to be involved in nuclear functions, especially during the process of neurodegeneration. It was reported that neuro-toxicity results in the enrichment of Cdk5 kinase activity in nucleus (23Gong X. Tang X. Wiedmann M. Wang X. Peng J. Zheng D. Blair L.A.C. Marshall J. Mao Z.

A number of transcription factors, including retinoblastoma, p53, myocyte enhancer factor-2, and STAT3, were demonstrated to be substrates for Cdk5 (1Lew J. Beaudette K. Litwin C.M.E. Wang J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13383-13390Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6Zheng M. Leung C.L. Liem R.K. J. Neurobiol. 1998; 35: 141-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 20Fu A.K.Y.

These studies on the ability of Cdk5 to regulate the transcriptional activities greatly expand the spectrum of processes and substrates regulated by Cdk5. However, the precise mechanism by which Cdk5 regulates transcription remains to be explored. In this study, we provide the first demonstration that Cdk5 phosphorylates mSds3, an integral component of the co-repressor complex, and regulates mSds3-mediated repression of transcription. Given the important role of histone acetylation in neuronal development and neurodegenerative diseases, our novel findings on the involvement of Cdk5 in regulating mSds3-mediated repression have far-reaching implications (37Mattson M.P. Ageing Res. Rev. 2003; 2: 329-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). For example, the status of histone acetylation in hippocampus was recently shown to be regulated during the process of memory formation (38Levenson J.M. O'Riordan K.J. Brown K.D.

Chem. 2004; 279: 40545-40559Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (880) Google Scholar), whereas other studies have shown that E2F-dependent gene repression and derepression are closely related to the regulation of neuronal apoptosis (39Liu D.X.

Delineating the molecular mechanism by which Cdk5 modulates the function of the mSds3-Sin3-HDAC co-repressor complex provides a new avenue in understanding how Cdk5 contributes to the regulation of gene transcription in the nervous system.

Ashok Kulkarni and Thomas Curran for the Cdk5 null mice, Dr. Hsin-ichi Hisanaga for recombinant Cdk5/p35 protein, and Dr. Kai Cheng, Alberto Ng, and Winnie Chien for excellent technical assistance."

The crystal structure of rTp32 (determined at a resolution of 1.85 Å) shows that the organization of rTp32 is similar to other periplasmic ligand-binding proteins (PLBPs), in that it consists of two α/β domains, linked by two crossovers, with a binding pocket between them. In the pocket, a molecule of l-methionine was detected in the electron density map. Residues from both domains interact with the ligand.

Although syphilis is one of the oldest recognized sexually transmitted diseases, it remains among the most poorly understood. This primarily is a consequence of the fact that the etiological agent, Treponema pallidum, cannot be cultivated continuously in vitro (1Norris S.J. Microbiol. Rev. 1993; 57: 750-779Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Hence, classical approaches for discerning T. pallidum membrane biology, which could reveal key aspects of its enigmatic parasitic strategy, are largely constrained (2Radolf J.D. Trends Microbiol. 1994; 2: 307-311Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 3Radolf J.D. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 16: 1067-1073Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). It is now generally accepted that lipoproteins are important integral membrane proteins of T. pallidum (4Chamberlain N.R. Brandt M.E. Erwin A.L. Radolf J.D. Norgard M.V. Infect. Immun. 1989; 57: 2872-2877Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 5Haake D.A. Microbiology. 2000; 146: 1491-1504Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar); in fact, lipoproteins represent about 3% of the total coding capacity of the treponemal genome (6Fraser C.M.

Bacteriol. 2004; 186: 2303-2308Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), existing gene sequences and/or BLAST search information have not been fruitful for predicting the functions of treponemal lipoproteins. As an alternative approach to understanding the peculiar membrane biology of T. pallidum (2Radolf J.D. Trends Microbiol. 1994; 2: 307-311Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 3Radolf J.D. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 16: 1067-1073Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 15Cox D.L. Chang P. McDowall A. Radolf J.D. Infect. Immun. 1992; 60: 1076-1083Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we recently embarked on a structural biology initiative that seeks to garner structural insights into putative functions for a number of the T. pallidum membrane lipoproteins. To this end, x-ray crystallographic studies were performed on Tp32 (gene number Tp0821). In the course of these studies, l-methionine was detected within a putative ligand-binding protein-like cleft. This has led us to conclude that Tp32 likely serves as a periplasmic receptor for l-methionine, probably lipid-linked to the outer leaflet of the T. pallidum cytoplasmic membrane. These findings add to our knowledge of the functions of treponemal membrane lipoproteins. The importance of Tp32 as a receptor for l-methionine, as well as its unique features, is discussed. Construction of His6-tagged rTp32—To create a non-lipidated version of recombinant Tp32 (rTp32) in Escherichia coli, a fragment encoding amino acids 2-245 (residue 1 is the post-translationally modified N-terminal cysteine) was amplified by PCR using a genomic DNA template isolated from T. pallidum. The PCR primers were 5′-acgcGGATCCACTCAGGTGAAGGATGAAACGGTGG-3′ and 5′-atccAAGCTTTTACAAAGCAGGCGCCACCTCC-3′. The forward primer contained both an acgc overhang and a BamHI site (bold); the reverse primer contained an atcc overhang and a HindIII site (bold). PCR was performed using TaKaRa Ex Taq DNA polymerase with an annealing temperature of 55 °C. The amplification product was directionally cloned into the pProEX HTb vector (Invitrogen) that adds an N-terminal His6 tag followed by a Tobacco Etch Virus protease cleavage site. Ligations were transformed into E. coli XL1-Blue competent cells (Stratagene), and colonies that tested positive by restriction digest were sequenced for verification. Expression and Purification of rTp32—E. coli XL1-Blue containing the cloned tp32 gene fusion was grown at 37 °C in LB medium containing 100 μg/ml of ampicillin until the cell density reached an OD600 of 0.6. The culture was then shifted to 30 °C and induced for 5 h with 600 μm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. Cells were harvested by centrifugation and lysed at room temperature for 30 min using 50 ml/liter culture of B-PER II (Pierce). The resulting suspension was spun at 27,000 × g for 15 min to pellet the cell debris. rTp32 was isolated from the supernatant by immobilization on a Ni2+-affinity column and was eluted using 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.5), 200 mm NaCl, 200 mm imidazole. Protein buffer was exchanged with 20 mm Hepes (pH 7.5), 100 mm NaCl, 15 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 2 mm octyl-β-glucoside (buffer A) by ultrafiltration using an Amicon device with a 10,000 molecular weight (MW) size exclusion. The concentrated protein was then applied to a HiLoad 16/60 Superdex 75 gel filtration column that was preequilibrated in buffer A, using an Äkta fast performance liquid chromatography (FPLC) system (Amersham Biosciences). The column was run at a flow rate of 0.2 ml/min. Subsequent to elution, peak fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. At this stage, protein was pure to apparent homogeneity (i.e. >95%). Fractions containing purified rTp32 were pooled and concentrated in buffer A to 30-35 mg/ml for crystallization. The oligomeric state of the purified protein was determined by size exclusion chromatography, using a calibration curve made with protein standards (Amersham Biosciences). For the production of selenomethionine (SeMet)-labeled protein, the expression vector was transformed into the methionine auxotroph E. coli B834 (Novagen) and grown in the presence of LB and 95% M9 medium supplemented with 125 mg/liter each of adenine, uracil, thymine, and guanosine nucleotide, 2.5 mg/liter thiamine, 4 mg/liter d-biotin, 20 mm glucose, 2 mm MgSO4, 50 mg/liter each of 19 l-amino acids (excluding methionine), and 50 mg/liter l-selenomethionine (Sigma). For 15N/13C-Met incorporation, E. coli containing the expression vector was grown in M9 minimal medium supplemented with 1 mg/liter of 15NH4Cl (Cambridge Isotope Laboratory) as the sole nitrogen source and 1 mm l-methionine-methyl-13C (Sigma). Protein concentration was estimated from a molar extinction coefficient at 280 nm (16Pace C.N. Vajdos F. Fee L. Grimsley G. Gray T. Prot. Sci. 1995; 4: 2411-2423Crossref PubMed Scopus (3472) Google Scholar). The molecular weight of rTp32 was determined by electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry (ESI-MS). Protein N-terminal sequencing was performed by Edman degradation in an Applied Biosystem Model 494 automated protein sequencer. Proteomics and sequence analysis tools, available at the ExPASy proteomics server (us.expasy.org), were used for protein sequence analysis. Preparation of Apoprotein and NMR Spectroscopy—For the production of ligand-free rTp32, purified protein was denatured at room temperature for 48 h in buffer A containing 6 m guanidine-HCl. Unbound ligand was removed by ultrafiltration in an Amicon-stirred cell using a 10,000 MW size exclusion filter and exhaustive washing with 500 ml of the above buffer. Protein was renatured by dilution into 1 liter of buffer A at a rate of 0.1 ml/min. After renaturation, residual insoluble protein was removed from the soluble refolded protein by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 20 min. The renatured protein was further purified by gel filtration chromatography (as described above) and concentrated for NMR spectroscopy. All NMR experiments were performed on a Varian INOVA 500 MHz spectrometer, using NMRPipe (17Delaglio F. Grzesiek S. Vuister G.W. Zhu G. Pfeifer J. Bax A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1995; 6: 277-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (11638) Google Scholar) for data processing and NMRView (18Johnson B.A. Blevins R.A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1994; 4: 603-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (2686) Google Scholar) for analysis. Unless otherwise noted, data were collected on 500 μm samples in buffer A at 25 °C. Protein Crystallization and Structure Determination—Wild-type rTp32 was crystallized by hanging-drop vapor diffusion (24Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16979) Google Scholar) using 24-well Linbro plates (Hampton Research). Index crystallization kits (Hampton Research) were used to screen preliminary conditions. 62 of 96 droplets yielded crystals. The best crystals of rTp32 were routinely obtained with drops containing 5 μl of protein at a concentration of 35 mg/ml in buffer A and 5 μl of 0.4 m succinic acid (pH 7.0) at 20 °C. Crystals of a SeMet variant of rTp32 were generated under the same conditions. Crystals developed in 2-4 days. In order to cryoprotect a crystal, a solution of 0.4 m succinic acid and 2,3-butanediol was added to the crystal mother liquor, such that the final concentration of the 2,3-butanediol was 15%(v/v). Crystals so treated were transferred to a solution of 0.5 m succinic acid and 15% (v/v) 2,3-butanediol, then flash-cooled in liquid propane and subsequently stored under liquid nitrogen. Diffraction data were collected at 100 K using synchrotron radiation from beamline 19-ID of the Structural Biology Center at the Advanced Photon Source (Argonne National Laboratory). The diffraction data were indexed, integrated, and scaled in the HKL2000 program package (19Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38617) Google Scholar). Data sets were taken on a crystal of the SeMet variant of rTp32 to a maximum Bragg spacing (dmin) of 1.6 Å and on a native rTp32 crystal (dmin = 1.85 Å). Statistics on the crystallographic data are found in Table I. Phases for the protein were obtained by the single-anomalous dispersion (SAD) method with the program Solve (20Terwilliger T.C. Berendzen J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 1999; 55: 849-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (3220) Google Scholar) using data collected on the SeMet variant of rTp32 at a wavelength corresponding to the absorption maximum of selenium. The resolution range used was 19.84-2.00 Å. The program identified five selenium sites, and the initial phases had a figure of merit of 0.50. An initial model was constructed automatically using the program Resolve (21Terwilliger T.C. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 2002; 58: 2213-2215Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 22Terwilliger T.C. Acta Crystallogr. Sect.

A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13014) Google Scholar). At this stage, electron density for a bound l-selenomethionine was clearly present at the interface between the two domains in Tp32. Refinement of the model utilized data from the aforementioned native crystal of rTp32. The native data showed corresponding electron density for a bound l-methionine. The model was refined using the simulated-annealing, conjugate-gradient minimization, and individual B-factor refinement protocols available in CNS version 1.1 (24Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M.

The model was adjusted using O and XtalView (25McRee D.E. J. Mol. Graph. 1992; 10: 44-46Crossref Google Scholar). Solvent molecules were added after the protein part was complete and where chemically reasonable. The final model includes residues 5-244 of rTp32 and a single, non-covalently bound molecule of l-methionine. Table I shows the refinement statistics. Automated searches for structurally related proteins were carried out using the DALI server (26Holm L. Sander C. Proteins. 1994; 19: 165-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). The strongest similarity (Z = 18.5, where Z > 2 is considered to be similar) was between rTp32 and the hypothetical protein pg110 fragment. When an individual domain of the protein was used as the basis of the search, similarities to several members of the periplasmic protein binding-like superfamily, as defined by the Structural Classification of Proteins, were apparent (27Murzin A.G. Brenner S.E. Hubbard T. Chothia C. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 247: 536-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (5610) Google Scholar). For example, domain II of rTp32 (see below) had a Z score of 12.2 when compared with one of the domains of the lysine-, arginine-, and ornithine-binding protein.Table IData collection, phasing, and refinement statistics.StructureNativeSeMetSpace groupP21212P21212a96.24895.893b46.40446.348c55.21755.154Resolution, ÅaNumbers in parentheses are for the highest resolution shell of the data.35.5-1.85 (1.88-1.85)50-1.65 (1.68-1.65)No. reflections87,097 (2474)373,993 (11744)Unique reflections (F > 0)38,697 (907)56,743 (2717)Completeness, %98.1 (87.7)99.2 (94.1)Avg. redundancy4.0 (2.7)6.6 (4.3)Avg.

Open table in a new tab Biophysical Characteristics of Purified rTp32—Recombinant Tp32 was created as a non-acylated fusion protein with an N-terminal His6 tag and spacer residues totaling 28 amino acids. The expression of this fusion protein in E. coli resulted in the production of soluble protein. Typical yields for purifications were 20-25 mg per liter of culture (>95% pure protein). Upon storage overnight at 4 °C in 20 mm Hepes (pH 7.5), 100 mm NaCl, 15 mm β-mercaptoethanol, recombinant rTp32 precipitated. The precipitate was solubilized by the addition of 2 mm octyl-β-glucoside, followed by incubation for 12 h at room temperature. Size-exclusion chromatography revealed that resolubilized rTp32 was conformationally homogeneous; re-solubilized rTp32 eluted from the column as a single peak with a calculated molecular mass of about 26 kDa. This is in close agreement with the mass determined by ESI-MS (27,464 Da), indicating that the recombinant protein behaved as a monomer in solution. However, the expected mass, based on the sequence of our construct, of rTp32 (30,155 Da) is 2,691 Da higher than the experimentally derived mass of the purified protein. N-terminal sequencing confirmed that the first 21 of 28 vector-derived amino acid residues of rTp32 had been proteolyzed. The 1H-15N heteronuclear single quantum coherence (HSQC) spectrum of rTp32 exhibited good peak dispersion and uniform intensity (see Fig. 3), indicating that rTp32 was well folded and suitable for crystallization. Crystal Structure of rTp32—To glean possible insights into the function of rTp32, we determined its crystal structure at a resolution of 1.85 Å. rTp32 contains two domains exhibiting a mixed α/β structure, with both domains being of similar fold (Fig. 1). The 55 Cα atoms from analogous secondary structural elements in the two domains can be superposed with a root-mean-square (r.m.s.) deviation of 1.5 Å. The structure of each domain is comprised of a central core, which consists of a five-stranded β-sheet flanked by α-helices on both sides. We term this the “central fold.” In each β-sheet, one strand is anti-parallel. Domain I (residues 5-85 and 202-244) is slightly larger than Domain II (residues 89-194). The central fold of Domain I encompasses five β-strands and three α-helices. In addition to this, Domain I contains two α-helices proximal to the C terminus of the protein. Domain II has a small, two-stranded β-sheet and two small 310-helices outside of its central fold. For the purposes of this report, helix α5 is considered as one α-helix, but a notable feature of this helix is that it is tightly wound at both ends, exhibiting 310-helical hydrogen-bonding patterns. The protein contains two linkers between the domains, connector region I (CRI, residues 86-88), and connector region II (CRII, residues 195-201). CRI is devoid of regular secondary structure, but CRII features a small 310-helix. The total buried surface area at the interface between the two domains is 1,850 Å2. l-Methionine Binding Site—A molecule of l-methionine was unexpectedly observed within the electron density map, bound non-covalently within a pocket between the two domains (Fig. 2A). The identity of this molecule was ascertained using two methods: 1) the size and shape of the electron density was consistent with l-methionine; 2) the selenomethionine variant of rTp32 displays density in an anomalous difference Fourier map at the expected position of a selenium atom in selenomethionine (Fig. 2A). Because no amino acids were included in the crystallization medium, we assume the protein-acquired methionine from the cytoplasm of the expression organism (E. coli). The binding of l-methionine to rTp32 appears to be specific, because the electron density in the binding pocket displays no evidence of binding by other small molecules, even though all twenty amino acids and a multitude of other small metabolites are present in the E. coli cytoplasm. Both domains participate in the binding of the l-methionine (Fig. 2B). The pocket may be divided into two sections, main-chain binding and side-chain binding. The chemical character of these parts is well suited to binding an l-methionine, which, at physiological pH, has charged amino and carboxylate moieties and a mostly hydrophobic side chain. The main chain binding portion of the pocket is lined with polar and charged residues; these side chains engage in hydrogen bonds to the amino and carboxylate moieties of the bound l-methionine (Fig. 2B). Compensation for the charges on the bound methionine is provided by the charged residues Glu-87 and Arg-119. The side-chain binding side of the pocket harbors a mixture of hydrophobic and polar residues. The hydrophobic residues (Phe-61 and Tyr-44) make van der Waals contacts with the ϵ-methyl group. Most of the polar residues on this side of the pocket do not make hydrogen bonds to the methionine side chain. Rather, they provide further van der Waals contacts to the methionyl moiety (Fig. 2B). One polar residue, Asn-116, makes a hydrogen bond via the amide nitrogen atom of its side chain to the δ-sulfur in the methionine side chain. The amino acid-binding pocket of rTp32 appears to be well suited to specifically bind methionine. During the expression of the protein in the cytoplasm of E. coli, l-methionine outcompetes a myriad of other small molecules for binding to the amino acid binding pocket. The l-methionine is tightly bound to the protein. This is evidenced by the fact that the amino acid did not dissociate from rTp32 during several purification procedures in which no exogenous l-methionine was provided. Further buttressing this notion is the observation that only very harsh treatments were capable of removing the bound l-methionine (see below). The reasons for this tight binding are evident from the structure. The shape of the amino acid binding pocket is complementary to that of l-methionine; every atom of the side chain is involved in van der Waals interactions with the protein. Also, the aforementioned hydrogen bond between Asn-116 and the methionyl side chain makes the interaction even more favorable. It would be informative to assess whether other amino acids could bind to this methionine-binding pocket. Once it was determined that l-methionine was bound to purified rTp32, efforts were undertaken to obtain apoprotein. To this end, the protein was subjected to denaturation in 6 m guanidine hydrochloride, followed by renaturation (see “Experimental Procedures”). rTp32 treated in this manner was then analyzed by NMR. A 1H-15N HSQC spectrum of the apo and methionine-bound states of rTp32 (Fig. 3) revealed that renatured protein underwent significant conformational change, as indicated by peak broadening and an increase in the number of resonances in the random-coil range of the spectrum. In addition, comparative analysis of peak intensities between the native and renatured proteins showed that 20% of the renatured protein retained the l-methionine ligand. The renatured protein is functional, as indicated by the fact that the addition of 1 mm l-methionine to the renatured protein resulted in an HSQC spectrum that was identical to the native, liganded protein (not shown). Given the degree of difficulty in obtaining ligand-free rTp32, further quantitative studies of ligand binding to rTp32 remain technically challenging. Comparisons to Other Related Binding Proteins—An automated search for structurally related proteins reveals that Tp32 is a member of a group of proteins termed the periplasmic binding protein-like superfamily. This superfamily includes other proteins that bind amino acids, such as the lysine-, arginine-, ornithine-binding protein (LAOBP) and the histidine-binding protein (HisJ) (28Oh B.-H. Pandit J.

Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 4769-4779Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Many such proteins function as small-molecule receptor components of ABC transporter systems (30Nikaido H. Hall J.A. Methods Enzymol. 1998; 292: 3-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) that utilize ATP to transport small molecules from the external milieu to the cytoplasm. These structural similarities correlate with recent genetic studies suggesting that Tp32 has amino acid sequence homology to a methionine-uptake protein from E. coli, called YaeC (31Zhang Z. Feige J.N. Chang A.B. Anderson I.J. Brodianski V.M. Vitreschak A.G. Gelfand M.S. Saier M.H. Arch. Microbiol. 2003; 180: 88-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). YaeC is the methionine receptor for a newly discovered ABC transporter family, called the methionine uptake transporter (MUT) family. An amino acid sequence comparison between YaeC and Tp32 shows that the two globular portions of the proteins are about 34% identical. In particular, the residues that are in contact with the methionine are nearly 100% conserved (see below). The only exception is Glu-87 of Tp32. The equivalent position in YaeC is a tyrosine. The ability of rTp32 to bind l-methionine and the high degree of similarity between YaeC and Tp32 prompts us to conclude that the function of Tp32 likely is to serve as the methionine receptor (of a MUT ABC transporter) at the cytoplasmic membrane of T. pallidum. The high degree of sequence similarity observed between Tp32 and YaeC extends to all members of the MUT family (Fig. 4). Again, almost all the residues that contact the bound l-methionine are well conserved in this family. The least-conserved methionine-contacting residue is Glu-87. This is due to the fact that at least some members of this family bind methionine-binding peptides (see below). It is unknown whether both stereoisomers of methionine can bind to Tp32. Because T. pallidum apparently lacks the methionine racemase for conversion of d to l forms, the ability of this organism to utilize d-methionine is uncertain. Several other structures of periplasmic ligand-binding proteins (PLBPs) bound with their cognate amino acids are known (29Yao N. Trakhanov S. Quiocho F.A. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 4769-4779Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 32Oh B.-H. Ames G. F.-L. Kim S.H. J. Biol.

They are HisJ, LAOBP, and the glutamine-binding protein (QBP). The overall fold of these polypeptides is similar to that of rTp32. In comparing them to rTp32, the positions of the ∼140 analogous Cα atoms superpose with r.m.s. deviations of about 1.9 Å in all three cases. An overlay of rTp32 and QBP is shown in Fig. 5. Some significant differences between the two structures, however, exist outside of the central domain folds. In particular, two protrusions from the globular core of QBP are not present in rTp32. Researchers have speculated that these features interact with the membrane-spanning components of the LAOBP, HisJ, and QBP transporters (28Oh B.-H. Pandit J. Kang C.-H. Nikaido K. Gokcen S. Ames G.

One-day culture of rat islets with 10 mm leucine had no effect on glucose-induced insulin secretion. One-week leucine culture decreased the threshold for glucose-induced insulin secretion and increased maximal insulin secretion at 30 mm glucose. Glucose-induced cytosolic free Ca2+ was increased at 1 week but not at 1 day of leucine culture. Without glucose, ATP content was not different with or without leucine culture for 1 week. With 20 mm glucose, ATP content was higher by 1.5-fold in islets cultured for 1 week with leucine than those without leucine. Microarray experiments indicated that culture of RINm5F cells with leucine increased expression of ATP synthase β subunit 3.2-fold, which was confirmed by real time reverse transcription-PCR analysis (3.0- ± 0.4-fold) in rat islets at 1 week but not after 1 day with leucine culture. Down-regulation of ATP synthase β subunit by siRNA decreased INS1 cell ATP content and insulin secretion with 20 mm glucose.

Glucose is the main secretagogue of insulin secretion from pancreatic β-cells. The mechanisms of glucose-induced insulin secretion have been studied extensively. Through glycolysis and oxidation, glucose increases pancreatic β-cell ATP/ADP ratio, which closes ATP-sensitive potassium (KATP) channels and depolarizes the cell membrane. This results in an influx of extracellular Ca2+ and increase of free cytosolic [Ca2+] that stimulates exocytosis of insulin granules (1Ashcroft F.M. Rorsman P. Prog. Biophys. Mol.

In pancreatic β-cells, most of the intracellular ATP comes from the oxidation of glucose-derived pyruvate and oxidation of NADH in the mitochondria via the electron transport chain. Damage or inhibition of ATP synthesis results in β-cell dysfunction and impairs glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (8Brownlee M. J. Clin. Investig. 2003; 112: 1788-1790Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar, 9Krauss S. Zhang C.Y. Scorrano L. Dalgaard L.T. St. Pierre J. Grey S.T. Lowell B.B. J. Clin. Investig. 2003; 112: 1831-1842Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar). Some recent publications indicate that superoxide produced by hyperglycemia activates uncoupling-protein-2 (UCP2) and destroys the proton gradient between inner and outer mitochondrial membranes. This negatively affects the activity of ATP synthase, decreases ATP production, and impairs glucose-stimulated insulin secretion of pancreatic β-cells resulting in diabetes (8Brownlee M. J. Clin. Investig. 2003; 112: 1788-1790Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar, 9Krauss S. Zhang C.Y. Scorrano L. Dalgaard L.T. St. Pierre J. Grey S.T. Lowell B.B. J. Clin. Investig. 2003; 112: 1831-1842Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar). More recently, it is shown that mitochondrial metabolism sets the maximal limit of fuel stimulated-insulin secretion in β-cells (10Antinozzi P.A. Ishihara H. Newgard C.B. Wollheim C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 11746-11755Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). These findings imply that mitochondrial ATP synthesis may play a vital role in fuel-stimulated insulin secretion of pancreatic β-cells. Some amino acids, particularly leucine and its non-metabolizable analogue 2-amino-2-norbornanecarboxylic acid, have been known to stimulate insulin secretion from pancreatic β-cells by activation of glutamate dehydrogenase (11Sener A.

These studies indicate a new role of branched-chain amino acids in pancreatic β-cell biology in addition to serving as fuels or residues for protein synthesis. As the rate-limiting enzyme of glucose metabolism, it is believed that glucokinase sets a strict control on glucose metabolism in pancreatic β-cells. However, overexpression of glucokinase or hexokinase I fails to increase the maximal insulin output induced by glucose, although it decreases the threshold for glucose-induced insulin secretion in pancreatic β-cells (10Antinozzi P.A.

Other factor(s) may also be rate-limiting and contribute to the tight control of glucose-induced insulin secretion. As the key enzyme catalyzing the conversion of ADP and Pi to ATP in the electron transport chain, ATP synthase (complex V) may play an important role in ATP synthesis and hence glucose-induced insulin secretion. Thus, the aim of this study was to investigate the role of ATP synthase in glucose-induced insulin secretion by attempting to change its expression level with leucine culture and siRNA. Isolation and Culture of Rat Islets—Islets were isolated from 4–6 male Sprague-Dawley rats (220–300 g) by collagenase P digestion and Ficoll gradient centrifugation as described in detail previously (14Gao Z.Y. Li G. Najafi H. Wolf B.A. Matschinsky F.M. Diabetes. 1999; 48: 1535-1542Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Before culturing, the islets were washed at least three times with leucine-free RPMI 1640 (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mm glutamine, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 100 IU/ml penicillin in one sterile conical tube. Batches of 50–100 islets were cultured in 10 ml of RPMI 1640 with or without 10 mm leucine at 37 °C in 5% CO2, 95% air in a 6-cm dish for 1 day or 1 week. Medium was changed every three days. Insulin Secretion of Perifused Rat Islets—Fresh or cultured rat islets were washed once with 10 ml of pre-warmed KRB-G0 (0 mm glucose, 115 mm NaCl, 24 mm NaHCO3, 5 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 2.5 mm CaCl2, 25 mm Hepes (pH 7.4), and 0.1% bovine serum albumin) and perifused with KRB-G0 at 37 °C at a flow rate of 1 ml/min as described in detail previously (14Gao Z.Y. Li G. Najafi H. Wolf B.A. Matschinsky F.M. Diabetes. 1999; 48: 1535-1542Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). In each experiment, 30 islets of similar sizes were hand picked under microscopy and put in the perifusion chamber. The perifusion protocol was as follows: pre-perifusion in G0 for 60 min, followed by 10 min with G0, 20 min with G2, 20 min with G5, 20 min with G10, 20 min with G30, and 20 min with 30 mm KCl. G0, G2, G5, G10, and G30 represent KRB containing 0, 2, 5, 10 and 30 mm glucose, respectively. Insulin secretion was measured by radioimmunoassay at the University of Pennsylvania Diabetes Center. Free Cytosolic [Ca2+] Measurement—Islets were loaded in 3 ml of KRB-G0 with 2.0 μm fura-2 AM and 0.2 mg/ml pluronic F-127 at 37 °C in 5% CO2, 95% air for 30 min. Islets were placed in the center of a perifusion chamber and fixed onto the tip of a glass micropipet by slight suction. They were perifused with KRB at a flow rate of 1 ml/min at 37 °C. The method for measuring [Ca2+] of rat islets was described in detail previously (14Gao Z.Y. Li G. Najafi H. Wolf B.A. Matschinsky F.M. Diabetes. 1999; 48: 1535-1542Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). The perifusion protocol was as follows: 5 min with G0, G2, G5, G10, G30, and 30 mm KCl, respectively. Two to three islets of each condition were analyzed for each islet preparation. Data were collected from at least four islet preparations, and each preparation used four different rats. When calculating the increase of free cytosolic [Ca2+] in each experiment, the average concentration of cytosolic [Ca2+] between 0–5 min under KRB-G0 was set as baseline. For a given condition, the absolute value of cytosolic [Ca2+] was calculated as the mean concentration during the entire 5-min period of stimulation, whereas the net increase of [Ca2+] was obtained by subtracting the baseline value from the absolute value. Insulin Secretion and ATP Content Measurement in Incubated Islets—Islets were washed once with 10 ml of prewarmed KRB-G0 and then incubated in 10 ml of KRB-G0 at 37 °C in 5% CO2, 95% air for 30 min. Islets were then divided into batches of five islets and transferred into tubes containing 1 ml of KRB with 0, 5, or 20 mm glucose. Islets were incubated at 37 °C in 5% CO2, 95% air for 1 h in a shaking water bath. After incubation, 950 μl of supernatant was removed for insulin radioimmunoassay. Lysis buffer (450 μl) for ATP extraction (Roche Applied Science) was added into each tube containing islets. Islets were sonicated on ice for 40 pulses at 60% of maximal output. Sonicated samples were then frozen and thawed twice with dry ice to ensure complete lysis of cells. Islet lysate insulin content was assayed by radioimmunoassay. Islet lysate ATP content was measured using the ATP Bioluminescence Assay Kit HS II (Roche Applied Science). Fifty-μl samples were measured in triplicate. Data were collected from at least 15 batches of islets in four independent experiments. Quantitative Real Time RT-PCR assay—After treatments, islets were transferred to a 1.5-ml sterile tube and washed once with 1 ml of sterile diethyl pyrocarbonate-treated water. Total RNA was extracted from the islets using the RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen, Inc.), and agarose gel electrophoresis was used to analyze the quality of total RNA. Real-time RT-PCR was performed with One-step RT-PCR Master Mix reagents kit (TaqMan®). The cycling conditions for RT-PCR were as follows: 48 °C for 30 min and 95 °C for 10 min followed by 45 cycles of 95 °C for 15 s and 60 °C for 1 min. Quantitative values were obtained as threshold PCR cycle number (Ct) when the increase in fluorescent signal of PCR product showed exponential amplification. Target gene mRNA level was normalized to that of β-actin in the same sample. In brief, the relative expression level of the target gene compared with that of β-actin was calculated as 2–ΔCt, where ΔCt = Cttarget gene – Ctβ-actin. The ratio of relative expression of the target gene in leucine-treated islets to that of untreated islets was then calculated as 2–ΔΔCt, where ΔΔCt = ΔCttreated islet – ΔCtnon-treated islet (23Fitzhugh D.J.

Each sample was measured in duplicate for each experiment. Down-regulation of ATP Synthase by siRNA Cassette—Four siRNA cassettes targeting rat ATP synthase β subunit were designed and synthesized as PCR product (Genescript, Inc.). The target sequence of cassette A, which is under the control of human U6 promoter, is 5′-AGATGAGTGTTGAACAGGAAA-3′, and that of cassette B, which is under the control of human H1 promoter, is 5′-ATGGCACTGAAGGCTTGGTTA-3′. The target sequence of cassette C is 5′-TGGTGGTGATTCTTTCCTGCA-3′ under the control of U6 promoter and that of cassette D is 5′-CACCTGCTAAGATCTGCTGG-3′ under control of H1 promoter. The day before transfection, the INS1 cells were seeded in 24-well plates with antibiotic-free RPMI 1640 (10% fetal bovine serum) so that the cells could grow more quickly in culture and reach 80% confluence the next day. For transfection of each well, 0.15 or 0.30 μgof siRNA cassette DNA was diluted into 25 μl of Opti-MEM I (serum- and antibiotic-free) and mixed gently. Then, 4 μl of Plus™ Reagent (Invitrogen) was added and mixed gently. The mixture was incubated at room temperature for 15 min. At the same time, 1 μl of Lipofectamine™ 2000 (Invitrogen) was added to 25 μl of Opti-MEM I and mixed gently before the mixture was incubated at room temperature for 15 min. After incubation, the two mixtures were combined to generate DNA-Lipofectamine 2000 complex and incubated at room temperature for 15 min. During the incubation, the culture medium in 24-well plates was replaced with 200 μl of Opti-MEM I. The DNA-Lipofectamine 2000 complex was added into the well, and the plate was rocked gently back and forth. Cells were then incubated at 37 °C in 5% CO2-95% air for 3 h before 1 ml of complete RPMI 1640 was added into each well. The cells were cultured for 2 days. The cells were washed twice with 1 ml of KRB-G0 before they were preincubated in 1 ml of KRB-G0 for 1 h. They were then incubated in 1 ml of KRB with 0 mm or 20 mm glucose for 1 h. All KRB was transferred into a 1.5-ml tube and centrifuged at 15,000 rpm at 4 °C for 10 min. The supernatant was collected for insulin measurement by radioimmunoassay. Lysis buffer (200 μl/well) (Roche Applied Science) was added, and the cells were scraped on ice. The cell lysate was transferred into a 1.5-ml tube and centrifuged at 4 °C at 15,000 rpm for 15 min. The ATP content in the supernatant was assayed as above, and the data was normalized to its protein content. For real time RT-PCR, 48 h after transfection the cells were washed twice with 1 ml of ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline followed by extraction of total RNA. RT-PCR was performed as described above. Cloning of ATP Synthase β Subunit from INS1 Cells—Two specific primers, 5′-GAC GGG CCC AA ATG TTG AGT CTT GTG GGG CG T GTG-3′ containing an ApaI site and 5′-GAC GCG GCC GCA TCA CGA CCC ATG CTC CTC TGC CAG-3′ containing a NotI site, were synthesized. The full-length ATP synthase β subunit cDNA (GenBank™ accession number P19044) of 1.6 kb was amplified using rat INS1 cell mRNA as a template and cloned into pShuttle vector with the restriction enzymes ApaI and NotI. Overexpression of ATP Synthase β Subunit in INS1 Cells—Forty-eight h after transfection, cells were washed once with cold phosphate-buffered saline. Total RNA was extracted from the cells, and real time RT-PCR was performed as above. For insulin secretion, INS1 cells were seeded in a 24-well plate and transfected with pShuttle-ATP-synthase-β subunit. 48 h after transfection, the cells were washed twice with 1 ml of prewarmed KRB and preincubated in 1 ml of KRB-G0 for 1 h. Cells were then incubated in 1 ml of KRB containing 0, 5, or 20 mm glucose for 1 h, respectively. The cells transfected with empty pShuttle vector were used as control. Culturing Islets with Leucine Increases Glucose-induced Insulin Secretion—To investigate whether leucine can affect glucose-induced insulin secretion, rat islets were cultured in complete RPMI 1640 (11 mm glucose, 10% fetal bovine serum) with or without 10 mm leucine for 1 day or 1 week. The time course of perifusion is shown in Fig. 1, and the averaged insulin secretion during each condition is presented in Fig. 2. After a 1-day culture, both untreated (Leu0) and leucine-treated (Leu10) islets had similar basal insulin secretion in the absence of glucose (19.5 ± 4.7 nanounits/islet·min versus 13.7 ± 2.2 nanounits/islet·min, p > 0.05). With 2 mm glucose, insulin secretion of untreated and leucine-treated islets was 21.6 ± 4.1 nanounits/islet·min versus 22.2 ± 8.3 nanounits/islet· min (p > 0.05). With 5 mm glucose, insulin secretion of untreated and leucine-treated islets was 44.4 ± 26.4 nanounits/islet·min versus 42.6 ± 17.1 nanounits/islet·min (p > 0.05). With 10 mm glucose, insulin secretion of untreated and leucine-treated islets was 62.9 ± 20.1 nanounits/islet·min versus 87.9 ± 38.3 nanounits/islet·min (p > 0.05). With 30 mm glucose, insulin secretion of untreated and leucine-treated islets was 75.8 ± 8.8 nanounits/islet·min versus 115.4 ± 45.8 nanounits/islet·min (p > 0.05). When stimulated with 30 mm KCl, insulin secretion of untreated islets was 83.8 ± 20.3 nanounits/islet·min, which was not different from that of leucine-treated islets (129.6 ± 35.4 nanounits/islet·min, p > 0.05) (Fig. 2A). Thus, leucine treatment for 1 day failed to enhance glucose-induced insulin secretion in rat islets under all glucose concentrations tested and 30 mm KCl (Fig. 1A).Fig. 2Effects of leucine culture on average insulin secretion in perifused islets. The effects of 1-day (A) and 1-week treatment (B) with leucine on average insulin secretion are presented. G0, G2, G5, G10, and G30 represent 0, 2, 5, 10, and 30 mm glucose in KRB, respectively. The data are mean ± S.E. of six independent experiments from 12 different rats. There was no significant difference among three groups of islets at 1 day. #, p < 0.05 comparing treated and untreated islets. *, p < 0.05 comparing treated and fresh islets.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) After a 1-week culture, both untreated and leucine-treated islets had similar basal insulin secretion without glucose (36.8 ± 19.1 nanounits/islet·min versus 45.9 ± 17.1 nanounits/islet·min, p > 0.05) (Figs. 1 and 2). Even with 2 mm glucose, the average insulin secretion of leucine-treated islets (91.0 ± 18.7 nanounits/islet·min) was higher than that of untreated islets (29.5 ± 6.5 nanounits/islet·min, p < 0.05). With 5 mm glucose, the average insulin secretion was even higher (139.2 ± 24.3 nanounits/islet·min), whereas that of untreated islets was not different from its baseline (47.8 ± 12.9 nanounits/islet·min p > 0.05, Figs. 1B and 2B). With 10 mm glucose, insulin secretion of the treated islets (383.4 ± 127.6 nanounits/islet·min) was 4.3-fold higher than that of untreated islets (90.3 ± 9.5 nanounits/islet·min). With 30 mm glucose, insulin secretion of the treated islets (470.0 ± 137.5 nanounits/islet·min, p < 0.05) was 3.1-fold higher than that of untreated islets (154.3 ± 25.5 nanounits/islet·min, p < 0.05). With 30 mm KCl, insulin secretion of treated islets (468.4 ± 98.3 nanounits/islet·min) was 2.2-fold higher than that of untreated islets (214.1 ± 26.5 nanounits/islet·min, p < 0.05) (Fig. 1B). The glucose-induced insulin secretion in rat islets cultured without leucine was similar to that of fresh islets (Figs. 1 and 2). Thus, treatment of rat islets with 10 mm leucine decreased the threshold for glucose-induced insulin secretion and increased the maximal insulin output significantly in a time-dependent manner. Culturing Islets with Leucine Increases Glucose-induced Rise of Free Cytosolic [Ca2+]—Free cytosolic [Ca2+] plays a vital role in exocytosis of insulin granules in pancreatic β-cells. The effects of leucine treatment on glucose-induced changes of islet-free cytosolic [Ca2+] were also assayed. The basal [Ca2+] level without glucose of 1-day-cultured islets (68 ± 7 nm) was the same as that of fresh islets (76 ± 5 nm, p > 0.05). The KCl-induced [Ca2+] change was smaller in islets cultured for 1 day without (126 ± 22 nm) or with (125 ± 10 nm) leucine than the change in fresh islets (204 ± 36 nm, p < 0.05, Fig. 3A). However, there was no significant difference between the two culture conditions with all glucose concentrations tested or with 30 mm KCl (Figs. 3A and 4A). Both 1-day-treated and untreated islets had a smaller Ca2+ response and a smaller insulin secretion peak response to KCl than did fresh islets (Figs. 1A and 3A). Therefore, there was no significant difference in the glucose-induced change of free cytosolic [Ca2+] between 1-day-treated islets and untreated islets.Fig. 4Effects of leucine culture on average changes in free cytosolic [Ca2+] in rat islets. In each experiment, the average concentration of [Ca2+] from 0–5 min without glucose was set as baseline. The net change in [Ca2+] equals the average concentration of [Ca2+] for 5 min of stimulation minus the baseline. The open bars represents the control group without leucine, and the filled bars represents the leucine-treated group. A shows the islets cultured with 10 mm leucine for 1 day. B shows the islets cultured with 10 mm leucine for 1 week. The results are mean ± S.E. of at least eight islets in four independent experiments from four different rats. *, p < 0.05; **, p < 0.01 when compared with the untreated control.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Basal [Ca2+] without glucose was the same in islets cultured for 1 week with (72 ± 4 nm) or without (68 ± 6 nm) 10 mm leucine (p > 0.05). With 2 mm glucose, free cytosolic [Ca2+] of treated islets began to increase by 3 ± 1 nm (p < 0.05) compared with basal level, whereas that of untreated islets was the same as baseline (68 ± 6nm) (Fig. 4B). With 5 mm glucose, free cytosolic [Ca2+] of treated islets increased by 16 ± 4 nm (p < 0.05) when compared with baseline, whereas that of untreated islets was still the same as baseline (Fig. 4B). Glucose at 10 mm increased free cytosolic [Ca2+]by33 ± 6nm in treated islets but only 3 ± 1 nm in untreated islets. Glucose at 30 mm increased free cytosolic [Ca2+]by47 ± 6nm (p < 0.05) in treated islets but only by 9 ± 1 nm in untreated islets. Treated islets also had a significantly larger increase of [Ca2+] (80 ± 7 nm) than did untreated islets (33 ± 2 nm) when stimulated with 30 mm KCl compared with baseline (Figs. 3B and 4B). Therefore, there was a significant elevation of glucose-induced free cytosolic [Ca2+] in 1-week-treated islets compared with untreated islets (Figs. 3, B and C, and 4B). The dose-response curve of glucose-induced cytosolic Ca2+ rise was shifted to the left by leucine treatment. Effect of Leucine Culture on Islet ATP Content and Insulin Secretion—In islets cultured for 1 day without leucine, ATP content was 2.2 ± 0.2 pmol/islet without glucose and 3.2 ± 0.6 pmol/islet with 5 mm glucose or 3.1 ± 0.3 pmol/islet with 20 mm glucose (p > 0.05). In 1-day leucine-treated islets, ATP was 1.8 ± 0.3 pmol/islet without glucose and 2.8 ± 0.5 pmol/islet (p > 0.05) at 5 mm glucose or 2.9 ± 0.4 (p > 0.05) pmol/islet at 20 mm glucose (Fig. 5A). We did not detect significant difference in basal insulin secretion without glucose in the same islets cultured for 1 day with leucine (337 ± 81 nanounits/islet·h) or without leucine (243 ± 55 nanounits/islet·h). Glucose (5 mm)-induced insulin secretion was the same in islets cultured with leucine (488 ± 196 nanounits/islet·h) or without leucine (380 ± 79 nanounits/islet·h). Insulin secretion tended to be higher in the presence of 20 mm glucose, and there was no difference between the two culture conditions (1045 ± 425 nanounits/islet·h versus 1123 ± 290 nanounits/islet·h) (Fig. 5B). In islets cultured for 1 week without leucine, ATP content was increased by 1.6-fold at 5 mm glucose (2.6 ± 0.3 pmol/islet, p < 0.01) and by 1.6-fold at 20 mm glucose (2.5 ± 0.1 pmol/islet, p < 0.01) when compared with ATP content without glucose (1.6 ± 0.2 pmol/islet). These data are consistent with those published by other research groups (4Detimary P. Jonas J.C. Henquin J.C. J. Clin.

In 1-week leucine-treated islets, compared with G0 (1.5 ± 0.2 pmol/islet), ATP content was increased by 2.5-fold at 5 mm glucose (3.8 ± 0.3 pmol/islet, p < 0.01) and 2.5-fold at 20 mm glucose (3.7 ± 0.4 pmol/islet, p < 0.01), both of which were significantly higher than the ATP content of untreated islets (p < 0.01). In 1-week leucine-treated islets, basal insulin secretion without glucose (368 ± 68 nanounits/islet·h) was the same as that of untreated islets (302 ± 37 nanounits/islet·h, p > 0.05). Glucose at 5 mm induced 3.1-fold more insulin secretion in islets cultured for 1 week treated with leucine (2160 ± 251 nanounits/islet·h) than without leucine (694 ± 160 nanounits/islet·h, p < 0.05). Glucose at 20 mm induced a 1.9-fold increase in insulin secretion in islets cultured for 1 week treated with leucine (4060 ± 710 nanounits/islet·h) than without leucine (2180 ± 406 nanounits/islet·h, p < 0.05, Fig. 6B). Insulin content was significantly lower in islets cultured with leucine for 1 week and then incubated with 5 mm glucose (8.7 ± 1.5 microunits/islet) compared with control (18.6 ± 3.3 microunits/islet, p < 0.05).

https://openalex.org/W2075169657,"The capacity of (CTG·CAG)n and (GAA·TTC)n repeat tracts in plasmids to induce mutations in DNA flanking regions was evaluated in Escherichia coli. Long repeats of these sequences are involved in the etiology of myotonic dystrophy type 1 and Friedreich's ataxia, respectively. Long (CTG·CAG)n (where n = 98 and 175) caused the deletion of most, or all, of the repeats and the flanking GFP gene. Deletions of 0.6–1.8 kbp were found as well as inversions. Shorter repeat tracts (where n = 0 or 17) were essentially inert, as observed for the (GAA·TTC)176-containing plasmid. The orientation of the triplet repeat sequence (TRS) relative to the unidirectional origin of replication had a pronounced effect, signaling the participation of replication and/or repair systems. Also, when the TRS was transcribed, the level of deletions was greatly elevated. Under certain conditions, 30–50% of the products contained gross deletions. DNA sequence analyses of the breakpoint junctions in 47 deletions revealed the presence of 1–8-bp direct or inverted homologies in all cases. Also, the presence of non-B folded conformations (i.e. slipped structures, cruciforms, or triplexes) at or near the breakpoints was predicted in all cases. This genetic behavior, which was previously unrecognized for a TRS, may provide the basis for a new type of instability of the myotonic dystrophy protein kinase (DMPK) gene in patients with a full mutation.

Myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1) 1The abbreviations used are: DM1, myotonic dystrophy type 1; TRS, triplet repeat sequence; CFUs, colony-forming units; IPTG, isopropyl β-d-thiogalactoside; DSB, double-strand breaks; Ap, ampicillin. is an autosomal dominant neuromuscular disease that exhibits a high incidence (∼1:8000) and shows frequent mortality in affected infants (1Wells R.D. Warren S.T. Genetic Instabilities and Hereditary Neurological Diseases. Academic Press, San Diego1998Google Scholar). An unstable region on chromosome 19q13.3 was discovered as the genetic basis of DM1. A polymorphic locus was found to be larger in DM1 patients (1Wells R.D. Warren S.T.

These types of preferential single-strand stabilities and DNA conformational behaviors are integral to the interpretation of the genetic instability effects of TRS orientation relative to the direction of DNA replication (1Wells R.D.

A 2.5-kbp poly(purine·pyrimidine) tract from the human polycystic kidney disease 1 gene (PKD1), which is known to form triplexes, slipped structures, and other non-B DNA conformations (22Bacolla A.

Chem. 2001; 276: 18597-18604Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), induced long deletions and other instabilities in plasmids that were manifested by mismatch repair and, in some cases, transcription. The breakpoints occurred at or near the predicted non-B DNA conformations. Distance measurements also indicated a significant proximity of alternating purine·pyrimidine and oligo(purine·pyrimidine) tracts to breakpoint junctions in 222 gross deletions and translocations, respectively, involved in human diseases. In 11 of these deletions, which were analyzed in detail, the breakpoints were explicable by non-B DNA structure formation. Hence, Bacolla et al. (21Bacolla A. Jaworski A. Larson J.E. Jakupciak J.P. Chuzhanova N. Abeysinghe S.S. O'Connell C.D. Cooper D.N. Wells R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 14162-14167Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar) concluded that alternative DNA conformations trigger genomic rearrangements through recombination-repair activities. Also, a substantial literature is growing on the role of non-B DNA conformations involving low copy repeats in genomic rearrangements (deletions, inversions, duplications, translocations, etc.) associated with human diseases (reviewed in Ref. 23Bacolla A. Wells R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 47411-47414Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). Here we have substantially extended these studies by exploring the capacity of CTG·CAG and GAA·TTC repeat tracts of various lengths, extents of interruptions (polymorphisms), and orientations to serve as mutagens, as a function of transcription. Most surprisingly, long CTG·CAG repeat tracts promoted the formation of inversions and long deletions (0.6–1.8 kbp) that removed part or all of the repeats as well as the flanking GFP reporter gene. This behavior, if found in humans, implies that the DMPK gene flanking the long CTG·CAG repeats in patients may be subject to deletions and rearrangements, thus labilizing the DMPK protein. Escherichia coli Strains—Strains JTT1 and AB1157 were obtained from the E. coli Genetic Stock Center, Yale University, New Haven, CT. The E. coli strains KMBL1001 and CS5428 were obtained from Dr. Nora Goosen (Leiden Institute of Chemistry, The Netherlands). The E. coli strains JJC510 and KA796 were kind gifts from Dr. Benedicte Michel (Institut National de la Recherche Agronomique, France) and Dr. R.

The (CTG·CAG)17 and (CTG·CAG)98 tracts are pure (uninterrupted), and the (CTG·CAG)175 sequence contains two G to A interruptions at repeats 28 and 69 (5Kang S. Jaworski A. Ohshima K. Wells R.D. Nat. Genet. 1995; 10: 213-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). All of the repeat tracts have 19 and 41 bp of nonrepetitive human flanking sequences 5′ and 3′ of the (CTG·CAG)n repeats, respectively (5Kang S. Jaworski A. Ohshima K. Wells R.D. Nat.

Montermini L. Wells R.D. Pandolfo M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 275: 14588-14595Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (272) Google Scholar). Both repeating tracts are pure (uninterrupted) and have ∼254 and ∼354 bp of human sequences, respectively, flanking the repeats (26Ohshima K. Montermini L. Wells R.D. Pandolfo M. J. Biol.

Cloning of the (CTG·CAG)n and (GAA·TTC)n Sequences into pG-FPT—The strategy was to clone the TRS downstream from and in close proximity to the GFP gene. The fragments containing the CTG·CAG and the GAA·TTC sequences were recloned into the pGFPT vector plasmid (Fig. 1). The fragments were prepared as follows: the parental plasmids containing (CTG·CAG)17, (CTG·CAG)98 and (CTG·CAG)175 were digested with EcoRI and NotI (New England Biolabs, Inc.), and these inserts were used to obtain clones with the repeats in orientation I (defined under “Experimental Procedures” and see Refs. 5Kang S.

The recessed 5′ terminus of this fragment was filled in with 0.1 unit of the Klenow fragment of E. coli DNA polymerase I (U. S. Biochemical Corp.) and the four dNTPs (0.1 mm each). To prepare fragments of CTG·CAG repeat (n = 175 and 17) for cloning in orientation II, the parental plasmid pRW3248 was digested with NotI, whereas cleavage of pRW3244 with EcoRI/HindIII was followed by filling in the termini with 0.1 unit of the E. coli DNA polymerase I Klenow fragment for blunt-end ligation. The parental plasmid containing (GAA·TTC)9 was digested with EcoRI and EcoRV, whereas the plasmid harboring (GAA·TTC)176 was treated with EcoRI and XbaI.Table INames and the relevant genotypes of the E. coli strains used in these studiesStrainRelevant genotypesNameRef.HB101F—, Δ(gpt-proA)62, leuB6, glnV44, ara-14, galK2, lacY1, Δ(mcrC-mrr), rpsL20, (Strr), xyl-5, mtl-1, recA13Cloning strain15Napierala M.

The gels then were stained with ethidium bromide, and the bands containing the triplet repeat fragments were excised. The DNA was then eluted and further purified by repeated phenol/chloroform extractions and precipitation with ethanol (27Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd, Ed., Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). For clone preparation with inserts in orientation I, the fragments containing (CTG·CAG)n (where n = 17, 98, and 175) were ligated to pGFPT digested with EcoRI and EagI (EagI and NotI have compatible sticky ends). To prepare the vector for cloning (CTG·CAG)98 in orientation II, the EcoRI/EagI digestion of pGFPT was followed by filling in the recessed 5′ termini with 0.1 unit of the E. coli DNA polymerase I Klenow fragment for the blunt-end ligation. For the cloning of (CTG·CAG)n fragments (where n = 17 and 175) in orientation II, the vector was linearized with StuI and EagI, respectively. The pGFPT vector for cloning the fragments containing the (GAA·TTC)n in orientation II was prepared as follows. To ligate the (GAA·TTC)9-containing fragment, the vector was cleaved with EcoRI and StuI, whereas for the ligation of the (GAA·TTC)176 repeat sequence, the pGFPT was cleaved by EcoRI and SpeI (SpeI and XbaI have compatible sticky ends). The digested DNA was electrophoresed, and the appropriate bands were excised and eluted, as described above. The vector and the insert were mixed in a molar ratio of ∼1:10 and ligated for 16 h at 16 °C by the addition of 20 units of T4 DNA ligase (U. S. Biochemical Corp.). The ligation mixture was ethanol-precipitated and transformed by electroporation (2.5 kV, cuvette size 0.2 mm) into E. coli HB101 (27Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd, Ed., Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) and plated on LB agar plates containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin (Ap). The transformants were screened by using a long wavelength UV lamp and were used to prepare a liquid culture. The plasmids were isolated, purified by CsCl density gradient ultracentrifugation (27Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd, Ed., Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar), and characterized by restriction mapping to verify the lengths of the cloned TRS. Also, the plasmids were sequenced using a ThermoSequenase Radiolabeled Terminator Cycle Sequencing Kit (U. S. Biochemical Corp.) The sequencing reactions were carried out according to the manufacturer's recommendations using the following primers: AP1 (CGAATTCGAGCTCGGTACCCGGG) and AP2 (GCAGGTCGGCCTCAGCCTGGCCG) (Genosys). The products of the sequencing reactions were analyzed on 6% Long Ranger Gels (FMC BioProducts), containing 7.5 m urea, in the glyceroltolerant gel buffer (U. S. Biochemical Corp.). The gels were dried and exposed to x-ray film. The superhelical forms of the DNA containing the undeleted CTG·CAG and GAA·TTC tracts in orientations I and II (5Kang S. Jaworski A. Ohshima K.

Biol. 1996; 264: 82-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) were used for all subsequent experiments. The pGFPT vector was used as a control (Fig. 1). Transformation of TRS-containing Plasmids into E. coli—pGFPT or its derivatives containing the TRS were transformed into the appropriate E. coli strains by electroporation (27Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd, Ed., Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The transformation mixture was used to inoculate 10 ml of LB media containing ampicillin (100 μg/ml) and isopropyl β-d-thiogalactoside (IPTG) (2 mm). The cultures were incubated at 37 °C and grown until they reached an A600 of ∼0.8–1.0 (18Bowater R.P. Jaworski A. Larson J.E. Parniewski P. Wells R.D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 2861-2868Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). An aliquot (10 μl) was inoculated into 10 ml of fresh LB media (with Ap and IPTG, as before). Recultivations of the cultures were repeated through five growth cycles for these population studies. After the 1st, 3rd, and 5th growth cycles, the cell populations were harvested, and DNA was isolated by alkaline lysis using the Wizard Plus Miniprep DNA Purification System (Promega). The plasmids were then digested with EcoRI and EagI to release the CTG·CAG- and GAA·TTC-containing fragments, which were radiolabeled with [α-32P]dATP, and electrophoresed on a 7% native polyacrylamide gel. The gels were then analyzed using a PhosphorImager (Storm 820, Amersham Biosciences). Conditions of Bacterial Growth for the Screening of White Colonies upon Transcription Activation or Repression—Six parental E. coli strains were used to evaluate the capacity of the TRS to induce mutations in the upstream reporter GFP gene. To identify single green and white colonies (“white CFUs”), the liquid culture from growth cycles 1, 3, and 5 were spread on LB agar plates containing Ap (150 μg/ml) and IPTG (2 mm), and the plates were incubated at 37 °C. By using a long wavelength UV lamp, green and white colonies were counted. In each experiment, ∼100 white colonies from the 1st, 3rd, and 5th growth cycles were re-streaked three times on LB agar plates (Ap and IPTG as before) to be certain that the loss of fluorescence was a permanent phenotype (22Bacolla A. Jaworski A. Connors T.D. Wells R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 18597-18604Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Approximately 30 white colonies were transferred to LB liquid media and grown at 37 °C, and the DNA was isolated. This DNA was used for restriction analyses, DNA sequencing, and re-transformation into new competent E. coli cells to confirm the white phenotype. Parallel experiments were also conducted with the pIQ-kan repressor (28Bowater R.P. Chen D. Lilley D.M. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 9266-9275Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) (gift from Dr. Richard P. Bowater, University of East Anglia, UK) to turn off transcription (21Bacolla A. Jaworski A. Larson J.E. Jakupciak J.P. Chuzhanova N. Abeysinghe S.S. O'Connell C.D. Cooper D.N. Wells R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 14162-14167Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). For the purpose of these studies, the E. coli strains (Table I) were first transformed with pIQ-kan expressing the repressor and then subsequently with the appropriate plasmids harboring the CTG·CAG and GAA·TTC repeats (Fig. 1). The transformation mixture was inoculated into 10 ml of LB media containing ampicillin (100 μg/ml) and kanamycin (50 μg/ml), and the recultivation assay was conducted as described earlier. After the 1st, 3rd, and 5th growth cycles, the cultures were plated on LB agar plates containing Ap (150 μg/ml), kanamycin (50 μg/ml), and IPTG (2 mm) and incubated at 37 °C. After the green and white colonies were counted and the white ones re-streaked (three times), the liquid cultures were prepared, and DNA was isolated as described previously. The utilization of different parental strains enabled a preliminary survey of the potential role of genetic backgrounds on the mutagenic process. Sequencing Primers—The primers for sequencing the regions upstream of the GFP gene and downstream of the CTG·CAG as well as the GAA·TTC repeat sequences were obtained from MWG Biotec (High Point, NC) or from Sigma Genosys (The Woodlands, TX). The forward primer at position 52 of pRW5301 was GCAGCTGGCACGACAGGTTTCC. The reverse primers at position 1509 or 1846 of the same plasmid were CAAGCTGTGACCGTCTCCG and CAGGGTTATTGTCTCATG, respectively. In some cases, it was necessary to use a primer at the origin of replication. This forward primer at position 3390 was GCTTCCAGGGGGAAACGCCTG. To detect breakpoints of the mutants of pRW5304, the reverse primer GGCGTATCACGAGGCCCTTAAG at position 2459 and the forward primer GCTTCCAGGGGGAAACGCCTG at position 4147 of the plasmid were employed. The primers and the plasmids were used at a concentration of 10 pmol/μl and 200 ng/μl, respectively, for the sequencing reactions. DNA Sequencing—The DNA isolated from the 47 mutant white colonies was sequenced from both strands by using the primers described above. The DNA was sequenced in the Molecular and Human Genetics Sequencing Core at the Baylor College of Medicine, Houston. The DNA of the mutants was analyzed by cycle sequencing using a GeneAmp PCR System 9700 and the ABI 3700 Sequencer. Cycle sequencing conditions were as follows: initial denaturation at 96 °C for 10 min, and 25 cycles of heating (96 °C, 10 s), annealing (50 °C, 30 s), and elongation (60 °C, 4 min). Strategy of Study—The GFP gene served as a reporter to study the influence of the triplet repeat tracts (CTG·CAG)n and (GAA·TTC)n on mutations in flanking sequences. All the TRS were cloned into the region of the vector that was adjacent and downstream to the GFP gene (Fig. 1), so that repair of the non-B DNA structures, which may form at the repeat sequences (21Bacolla A.

The (CTG·CAG)n-containing fragments (where n = 17, 98, and 175) were cloned either in orientation I or II, relative to the origin of replication; for the plasmids containing (CTG·CAG)n tracts in orientation I, the CTG repeat is in the leading strand template, whereas for the plasmids in orientation II, the CTG repeat is in the lagging strand template (5Kang S.

Although the activity of compstatin has been improved severalfold using combinatorial and rational design approaches, the molecular basis for its interaction with C3 is not yet fully understood. In the present study, isothermal titration calorimetry was employed to dissect the molecular forces that govern the interaction of compstatin with C3 using four different compstatin analogs. Our studies indicate that the C3-compstatin interaction is an enthalpy-driven process. Substitution of the valine and histidine residues at positions 4 and 9 with tryptophan and alanine, respectively, resulted in the increase of enthalpy of the interaction, thereby increasing the binding affinity for C3. The data also suggest that the interaction is mediated by water molecules. These interfacial water molecules could be the source for unfavorable entropy and large negative heat capacity changes observed in the interaction. Although part of the negative heat capacity changes could be accounted for by the water molecules, the rest might be resulting from the conformational changes in C3 and/or compstatin up on binding. Finally, we propose based on the pKa values determined from the protonation studies that histidine on compstatin participates in protonation changes and contributes to the specificity of the interaction between compstatin and C3. These protonation changes vary significantly between the binding of different compstatin analogs to C3.

Although part of the negative heat capacity changes could be accounted for by the water molecules, the rest might be resulting from the conformational changes in C3 and/or compstatin up on binding. Finally, we propose based on the pKa values determined from the protonation studies that histidine on compstatin participates in protonation changes and contributes to the specificity of the interaction between compstatin and C3. These protonation changes vary significantly between the binding of different compstatin analogs to C3. The complement system is a distinctive arm of the innate immune system that plays a critical role in the immune response. It is known to be activated through at least three different pathways, all of which converge at a single point involving the complement component C3. Numerous disease states have been described in which an overactive complement system has been implicated (1Makrides S.C. Pharmacol. Rev. 1998; 50: 59-87PubMed Google Scholar, 2Morgan B.P. Harris C.L. Mol. Immunol. 2003; 40: 159-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar), and in such situations complement needs to be inhibited. To date, several inhibitors have been designed to inhibit the complement system at several points in the cascade. The first inhibitor ever capable of inhibiting all three pathways of complement was the 13-amino acid cyclic peptide compstatin, identified by our group (3Sahu A. Kay B.K. Lambris J.D. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 884-891PubMed Google Scholar). This peptide, which blocks the complement cascade by binding to C3, was identified by screening a phage-display library. Compstatin exhibits a higher activity when its N terminus is acetylated and C terminus is amidated. In an attempt to understand the structure-activity relationships involved in the interaction between compstatin and C3, the three-dimensional structure of the free peptide in solution was previously determined using NMR (4Morikis D. Assa-Munt N. Sahu A. Lambris J.D. Protein Sci. 1998; 7: 619-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). The results indicated that in solution the peptide assumes a coil conformation with a type I β-turn. Alanine scanning revealed that the β-turn, comprising residues Gln-5, Asp-6, Trp-7, and Gly-8, is critical for activity of the peptide, and this turn has, therefore, been regarded as an important structural determinant of compstatin activity (4Morikis D. Assa-Munt N. Sahu A. Lambris J.D. Protein Sci. 1998; 7: 619-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). In contrast, alanine scanning of residues outside the β-turn yielded a more potent peptide in which His-9 was substituted with alanine, whereas substitution of other residues with alanine lowered the activity (4Morikis D. Assa-Munt N. Sahu A. Lambris J.D. Protein Sci. 1998; 7: 619-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 5Morikis D. Roy M. Sahu A. Troganis A. Jennings P.A. Tsokos G.C. Lambris J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 14942-14953Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Several efforts have been made to improve the inhibitory activity of compstatin using computational techniques (6Klepeis J.L. Floudas C.A. Morikis D. Tsokos C.G. Argyropoulos E. Spruce L. Lambris J.D. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2003; 125: 8422-8423Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), rational design (5Morikis D. Roy M. Sahu A. Troganis A. Jennings P.A. Tsokos G.C. Lambris J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 14942-14953Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), and phage-display library screening. In addition, global optimization studies carried out on this peptide indicated that an analog in which Val-4 was substituted with tyrosine was 16 times more potent (6Klepeis J.L. Floudas C.A. Morikis D. Tsokos C.G. Argyropoulos E. Spruce L. Lambris J.D. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2003; 125: 8422-8423Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Guided by these modifications, further substitutions were targeted at position 4 using several aromatic amino acids; these studies identified a peptide with a tryptophan at position 4 and alanine at position 9 that showed a 45-fold higher potency when compared with the initial identified peptide. 1Mallik, B., Katragadda, M., Spruce, L. A., Carafides, C., Tsokos, C. G., Morikis, D., and Lambris, J. D. (2005) J. Med. Chem., in press. This peptide is referred here as V4W/H9A. Despite all these improvements made in the activity of the peptide, the binding mechanism of compstatin to C3 remains elusive. Surface plasmon resonance (SPR) 2The abbreviations used are: SPR, surface plasmon resonance; ITC, isothermal titration calorimetry; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline. studies of the C3-compstatin interaction suggested that compstatin binds to C3 with a 1:1 stoichiometry (7Sahu A. Soulika A.M. Morikis D. Spruce L. Moore W.T. Lambris J.D. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 2491-2499Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Although these studies explained the kinetics of the interaction, no information about the nature of the interaction was deduced. Therefore, the present study using isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) was designed to yield insight into the nature of the interaction between C3 and compstatin. ITC, unlike SPR, permits the study of macromolecular interactions in solution. Using four different compstatin analogs, we were able to dissect the molecular interactions that define the association of compstatin with C3. The results of this study led to the formulation of a working molecular model for C3-compstatin interaction. Purification of Proteins—C3 was purified from fresh human plasma obtained from the blood bank at the Hospital of The University of Pennsylvania using standard procedures as described previously (8Hammer C.H. Wirtz G.H. Renfer L. Gresham H.D. Tack B.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 3995-4006Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, the plasma was fractionated using 15% (w/v) PEG 3350, and the pellet was resuspended in 20 mm phosphate, pH 7.8, buffer and then subjected to anion exchange column DEAE-HR 40, 50 × 5 cm (Millipore Inc., Billerica, MA) using the same buffer. The proteins were eluted with 6 liters of a linear gradient (15–70%) using 20 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.8, containing 500 mm NaCl. The C3 was further purified using a size exclusion column Superdex 200 26/60 (Amersham Biosciences) and a Mono S column (Amersham Biosciences) to separate C3 from C3(H2O). Peptide Synthesis and Purification—All the peptides used in this study were chemically synthesized using solid-phase peptide synthesis employing Fmoc chemistry as previously described (3Sahu A. Kay B.K. Lambris J.D. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 884-891PubMed Google Scholar, 4Morikis D. Assa-Munt N. Sahu A. Lambris J.D.

Immunol. 2000; 165: 2491-2499Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). All synthetic peptides were purified on a C18 reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography column to ∼95% purity. The resulting peptides had their N termini acetylated and C termini blocked. The sequences of the peptides used are as follows, with the amino acid modifications shown in boldface and underlined: V4H9, Ac-ICVVQDWGHHRCT-NH2; V4W, Ac-ICVWQDWGHHRCT-NH2; H9A, Ac-ICVVQDWGAHRCT-NH2; V4W/H9A, Ac-ICVWAHRCT-NH2 (Ac is an acetyl blocking group, and NH2 is a C-terminal blocking group). For the purposes of this paper, the peptide inhibitor in general will be referred to as compstatin. The parent peptide, with valine at position 4 and histidine at position 9, is designated V4H9. Other modifications made at these positions on the parent peptide are denoted with the corresponding amino acid modification. For example, V4W/H9A refers to the parent peptide with a tryptophan at position 4 and alanine at position 9. Sample Preparation—C3 samples were diluted to concentrations in the range of 3.5–5 μm in the appropriate buffers before the experiment and dialyzed overnight in the same buffer. The buffers used were (a)10 mm sodium phosphate containing 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.4 (PBS) and pH 6.7, (b)10mm Tris-HCl containing 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.4 and pH 6.7, (c) 10 mm MOPS containing 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.4 and pH 6.7, (d) 10 mm sodium phosphate containing 150 mm NaCl and 0.5 m (1 m) glycerol, pH 7.4, and (e) 10 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.4. Concentrations were determined based on the absorbance, and extinction coefficients were measured at a 280 nm wavelength. Peptides were solubilized in the dialysates resulted from the dialysis of proteins to exclude any heat effects from buffer mismatch. All peptide solutions were centrifuged to remove any insoluble material. Concentrations were determined based on the absorbance and extinction coefficients measured at 280 nm. Concentrations were adjusted to 179–200 μm for V4W/H9A, H9A, and V4W and to 380–450 μm for V4H9 before the ITC experiments. Protein and peptide solutions were degassed using a ThermoVac before loading into the ITC cell and syringe. ITC—ITC experiments were performed using a Microcal VP-ITC calorimeter (Microcal LLC, Northampton, MA) with C3 loaded into a cell, and the compstatin peptides were loaded into a syringe. Unless otherwise noted, all experiments were performed in PBS, pH 7.4; both the titrant and the protein are in the same buffers. To study the effects of protonation on the C3-compstatin interaction, additional calorimetric experiments were performed in 10 mm Tris-HCl with 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.4, or in 10 mm MOPS with 150 mm NaCl, pH 6.7. To study the role of water in the molecular recognition of compstatin by C3, experiments were performed in PBS, pH 7.4, with various osmolal concentrations. The desired osmolalities were achieved using molar concentrations of glycerol in the range of 0–1.5. Osmolality of the solutions was checked using an osmometer. All the experiments were performed at 25 °C unless otherwise indicated. In each experiment, about 20–30 injections of 2 μl of peptide were made into the cell containing protein. The syringe stirring speed was set to 300 rpm. Data were collected in high feedback mode, with a filter period of 2 s. For each experiment, a control titration was performed by injecting peptide into the appropriate buffer. Finally, the control data were subtracted from the raw data to obtain an isotherm corrected for heats of dilution. The resulting isotherms were fit to different models using the Origin 7.0 software, and the model that achieved lowest χ2 square value was deemed to be appropriate for the respective dataset. The best fit curve yielded values for thermodynamic parameters, including stoichiometry (n), enthalpy changes (ΔH), and association constant (Ka). ΔG was calculated using the Gibbs free energy relationship,ΔG=−RTlnKa(Eq. 1) and ΔS was calculated from ΔG using the Gibbs free energy equation.ΔG=ΔH−T ΔS (Eq. 2) Energetics of the C3-Compstatin Interaction—To study the thermodynamics of the C3-compstatin interaction, four different analogs designated V4H9, H9A, V4W, and V4W/H9A were used in the ITC experiments. The binding isotherms representing the binding events fit to a single set of binding sites model, suggesting an equimolar binding (Fig. 1). The four peptides bound to C3 in the increasing order of their affinities as follows: V4H9 (Kd = 1.3 μm) > H9A (Kd = 0.9 μm) > V4W (Kd = 0.36 μm) > V4W/H9A (Kd = 0.14 μm). Comparing these values with the activity1 of these peptides observed previously indicate that there exists a direct linear correlation between the binding and activity. In other words, binding of compstatin analogs to C3 proportionally affects their activity (data not shown). Our experiments indicate that the interaction between C3 and compstatin is characterized by unfavorable positive entropy and favorable negative enthalpy changes, indicating an enthalpy-driven process (Tables I and II). Isotherms representing the interaction, corrected for heats of dilution are shown in Fig. 1, A–D. As shown in the figure, the data fit to a 1:1 single set of binding sites model, which yielded all the thermodynamic parameters. Although the binding of the parent peptide V4H9 to C3 was characterized by a –12.12 kcal/mol enthalpy change and a –8.08 kcal/mol free energy change, the binding of V4W/H9A involved a –18.14 kcal/mol enthalpy change and a –9.4 kcal/mol free energy change. The enthalpy gain observed after substitution of positions 4 and 9 with tryptophan and alanine can most likely be attributed to additional polar non-covalent interactions initiated by these residues.Table IThermodynamic analysis of the C3-V4H9 interactionTemperatureBufferKaaBinding constant. × 105ΔHbChange in the enthalpy term.-TΔScChange in the entropy term.ΔGdChange in Gibbs free energy.°Cm-1kcal/molkcal/molkcal/mol15PBS, pH 7.417.6-9.51.27-8.2820PBS, pH 7.45.95-11.123.36-7.7925PBS, pH 7.47.71-12.124.08-8.0837PBS, pH 7.41.67-13.976.54-7.4625Tris, pH 7.47.68-167.98-8.0825MOPS, pH 7.43.21-157.5-7.5625PBS, pH 6.710.7-12.834.6-8.2725Tris, pH 6.75.4-13.75.87-7.8725MOPS, pH 6.77.78-11.883.84-8.0825PBePhosphate buffer (10 mm sodium phosphate)., pH 7.48.93-12.574.44-8.1725PBS + 0.5 m glycerol, pH 7.46.74-11.133.16-8.0025PBS + 1 m glycerol, pH 7.45.07-18.3610.56-7.83a Binding constant.b Change in the enthalpy term.c Change in the entropy term.d Change in Gibbs free energy.e Phosphate buffer (10 mm sodium phosphate).

Open table in a new tab To dissect the factors that dictate the enthalpy and entropic differences observed between the binding of V4H9 and V4W/H9A to C3, we tested the analogs, V4W and H9A, in ITC studies. Substitution of histidine at position 9 with alanine (H9A) increased the ΔH of the interaction by –2.2 kcal/mol (refer to ΔΔH, Fig. 2). On the other hand, substitution of valine at position 4 with tryptophan (V4W) also increased the enthalpy by –2.5 kcal/mol (ΔΔH, Fig. 2). These results indicate that tryptophan and alanine contribute equally to the binding enthalpy of the C3-V4W/H9A interaction. In addition, studies carried out with H9A and V4W indicated that tryptophan and alanine contribute equally (TΔΔS, Fig. 2) to the entropic penalty of binding and that the individual contributions add up to the total entropy loss suffered by V4W/H9A upon binding to C3. Effect of Temperature on Binding—In several protein-protein and protein-peptide interactions, calorimetric enthalpy could be affected by changes in the experimental temperature. Therefore, the calorimetric titrations were performed over a temperature range of 15–37 °C. Fig. 3 shows the calorimetric enthalpy, entropy, and free energy changes plotted against temperature. The enthalpy and entropy changes in the binding of V4H9 and V4W/H9A to C3 showed strong temperature dependence. In addition, a linear correlation between the enthalpy and entropy (Fig. 4) was observed, which is a common feature in macromolecular interactions. Such dependence has previously been shown in several studies involving macromolecular interactions (9Baker B.M. Murphy K.P. Lundback T. van Den Berg S. Hard T. Lemmon M.A. Ladbury J.E. J. Mol.

Although the enthalpy change increased, the entropy change decreased in a linear fashion with an increase in temperature. However, the free energy change remained unaffected. A linear dependence of calorimetric enthalpy on temperature indicates a two-state binding process with equilibrium between the free and bound forms. In contrast, a non-linear relationship indicates a complex process of binding.Fig. 4Enthalpy-entropy compensation in the case of C3-V4H9 (▪) and C3-V4W/H9A (•) interactions.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Temperature dependence of the enthalpy of binding can lead to heat capacity changes (ΔCp) upon binding, according to the relationship in Equation 3.ΔCp=(∂ΔH∂T)p(Eq. 3) The slope of the plot of ΔH versus temperature yields ΔCp. As shown in Fig. 3, the plot of ΔH versus temperature was linear and yielded a straight line with a correlation value of 0.99 for V4W/H9A and 0.98 for V4H9 binding. ΔCp was calculated from the slope of the plots to be –413 cal/mol/K for C3-(V4W/H9A) binding and –194 cal/mol/K for C3-(V4H9) binding. Effect of Buffer Ionization and pH on the C3-Compstatin Interaction—Often the enthalpy observed in a calorimeter is a result of the binding event in addition to all the associated events (water a(di)ssociation, ionization of the components, heats of dilution, heats of mixing, etc). To facilitate binding, residues at the interface may be protonated or deprotonated, resulting in exchange of protons with the buffer. Under such circumstances, calorimetric enthalpy is dependent on the buffer ionization enthalpy. To study the dependence of buffer ionization on calorimetric enthalpy, ITC titrations were performed in phosphate, Tris-HCl, and MOPS buffers at pH 7.4. An increase in the enthalpy change (ΔHobs) was observed with an increase in the buffer ionization enthalpy change (ΔHion) when V4H9 bound to C3. In contrast, when V4W/H9A bound to C3, a decrease in the enthalpy change was observed with an increase in the buffer ionization enthalpy change. A plot of calorimetric enthalpy against ionization enthalpy yielded the number of protons (nH+) involved in the interaction, and the binding enthalpy was corrected for protonation effects (ΔHbin) according to the following relationship.ΔHobs=ΔHbin+nH+⋅ΔHion(Eq. 4) Plots shown in Fig. 5, A and B, yielded an nH+ value of –0.35 and a binding enthalpy (ΔHbin) of –12.32 kcal/mol for the C3-(V4H9) interaction and values of +0.31 and –18.05 kcal/mol for the C3-(V4W/H9A) interaction. Although a positive slope indicates propensity for uptake of protons from the buffer, a negative value indicates propensity for release of protons into the buffer. Thus, the interaction between C3 and V4H9 appeared to be mediated by a net release of protons into the buffer, in contrast to the interaction between C3 and V4W/H9A, which involved a net uptake of protons from the buffer. In addition to the buffer effects, experimental pH can have a pronounced influence on the ionization of residues because of changes in their pKa values. To determine the effect of pH on the interaction between compstatin and C3, we carried out ITC studies at pH 6.7. Values of pH lower than 6.7 were not employed because of the reduced stability of C3 at lower pH. In these experiments, both peptides V4H9 and V4W/H9A exhibited calorimetric enthalpies lower than those at pH 7.4 (Fig. 5, A and B). However, the effect of buffer ionization on the observed calorimetric enthalpies was similar to that observed at pH 7.4. Plots of ΔHobs versus ΔHion at pH 6.7 gave nH+ and ΔHbin values of –0.1 and –12.23 kcal/mol for the C3-V4H9 interaction and 0.47 and 18.2 kcal/mol for the C3-V4W/H9A interaction. The number of protons released from or taken up into the buffer upon binding of compstatin to C3 indicates in the simplest case a single residue as responsible for the observed protonation changes. The contrasting protonation changes observed between binding of V4H9 and V4W/H9A can explain the effect of the amino acid modifications on the selectivity of compstatin in molecular recognition. Clearly, the number of protons involved at the interface showed a significant dependence on the experimental pH (Fig. 5, A and B). Baker and Murphy have proposed that a change in the number of protons released or taken up at the interface upon binding depends on the proton binding constants and experimental pH according to the following relationship (14Baker B.M. Murphy K.P. Biophys. J. 1996; 71: 2049-2055Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). This relationship holds only when a single amino acid residue is assumed to be involved in protonation or deprotonation at the binding interface,nH+=Kpc⋅10−pH1+Kpc⋅10−pH−Kpf⋅10−pH1+Kpf⋅10−pH(Eq. 5) where Kpc and Kpf are the proton binding constants for the free and complexed forms. The binding constant is equal to 10pKa of the ionizing group. In principle, the determination of nH+ at two different pH values should suffice to calculate the pKa of the ionizing group in both free and complex forms. Based on the nH+ values obtained at pH 7.4 and 6.7, pKaf and pKac were calculated to be 8.97 and 7.62 for the C3-V4H9 and 6.3 and 7.2 for the C3-V4W/H9A interactions. These pKa changes between free and bound forms are consistent with the release of protons observed when V4H9 bound to C3 and with the uptake of protons when V4W/H9A bound to C3. Effect of Solvent on the C3-Compstatin Interaction—Because water serves as a solvent for most biological processes, it is very important to understand the biomolecular interactions that occur in the presence of water molecules. In the case of protein-protein interactions, water molecules act as molecular determinants of ligand recognition, thus altering the specificity of the interaction (15Bhat T.N. Bentley G.A. Boulot G. Greene M.I. Tello D. Dall'Acqua W. Souchon H. Schwarz F.P. Mariuzza R.A. Poljak R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 1089-1093Crossref PubMed Scopus (462) Google Scholar, 16Morton C.J.

Chem. 1999; 274: 31272-31278Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). To gain insight into the role of water molecules in the molecular recognition of compstatin by C3, we carried out osmotic stress experiments. In the present study glycerol was included in the various buffers at different concentrations to induce osmotic stress. Glycerol molecules, because of their large size relative to water, are excluded from water-filled spaces at the binding interface, thus changing the activity of the bulk solvent. The subtle changes in the free energy that occur when the water activity is altered as a result of osmotic stress are indicators of differences in the hydration of complexed and uncomplexed states. For both the C3-V4H9 and C3-V4W/H9A interactions, differences in the free energy changes were observed in response to changes in solute osmolality (Tables I and II), consistent with the exclusion of solute molecules from the binding interface between C3 and compstatin. Also, a decrease in the association constant was observed with an increase in osmolality (Fig. 6). This increase indicates that osmotic stress weakens the interaction between C3 and compstatin. Based on the water activity and solute osmolality, the following relationship can be used to calculate the change in the number of solute-excluded water molecules (Δnw) associated with the binding event (17Swaminathan C.P. Nandi A. Visweswariah S.S. Surolia A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31272-31278Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar).∂logKa∂[solute]osmol=−2.303⋅Δnw55.56(Eq. 6) Plotting the logarithm of the association constant (Ka) against solute osmolality resulted in a slope of –0.17 for V4H9 and –0.12 for V4W/H9A binding. These slopes were further translated into Δnw using the above equation, yielding values of 4 for the C3-V4H9 and 3 for the C3-V4W/H9A interactions. Although a positive value for Δnw indicates uptake of water molecules at the vicinity of the binding interface, a negative value indicates concomitant release of water molecules. Thus, binding of V4H9 to C3 was accompanied by uptake of four water molecules at the interface, whereas binding of V4W/H9A to C3 was associated with the uptake of three water molecules. This type of interaction is in contrast to the release of water molecules observed in the formation of most protein-protein and protein-peptide complexes (17Swaminathan C.P. Nandi A.

In an effort to explain the increase in the binding activity of compstatin observed after substitutions at positions 4 and 9, four different compstatin analogs were used to pursue this goal. All the four analogs bind to C3 with different affinities, which reflect the differing activities of these analogs. However, the dissociation constants obtained using calorimetry for the interaction of V4H9 with C3 varied considerably from those obtained using Biacore (7Sahu A. Soulika A.M. Morikis D. Spruce L.

We cloned and expressed the cDNA encoding a 272-residue protein with an identical N-terminal sequence with that of FTX but failed to obtain hemolytically active protein. This, together with the presence of multiple FTX family proteins in the mushroom, prompted us to determine the complete primary structure of FTX by protein sequence analysis. The N-terminal 72 and C-terminal 107 residues were sequenced by Edman degradation of the fragments generated from the alkylated FTX by enzymatic digestions with Achromobacter protease I or Staphylococcus aureus V8 protease and by chemical cleavages with CNBr, hydroxylamine, or 1% formic acid. The central part of FTX was sequenced with a surface-adhesive 7-kDa fragment, which was generated by a tryptic digestion of FTX and recovered by rinsing the wall of a test tube with 6 m guanidine HCl. The 7-kDa peptide was cleaved with 12 m HCl, thermolysin, or S. aureus V8 protease to produce smaller peptides for sequence analysis. As a result, FTX consisted of 251 residues, and protein and nucleotide sequences were in accord except for the lack of the initial Met and the C-terminal 20 residues in protein. Recombinant FTX (rFTX) with or without the C-terminal 20 residues (rFTX271 or rFTX251, respectively) was prepared to study the maturation process of FTX. Like natural FTX, rFTX251 existed as a monomer in solution and assembled into an SDS-stable, ring-shaped pore complex on human erythrocytes, causing hemolysis. In contrast, rFTX271, existing as a dimer in solution, bound to the cells but failed to form pore complex. The dimeric rFTX271 was converted to hemolytically active monomers upon the cleavage between Lys251 and Met252 by trypsin.

Several cytolytic proteins have been isolated from the basidiocarps of both toxic and edible mushrooms, and their pore-forming properties as well as cardiotoxicity and cytotoxicity were studied (7Faulstich H.

Although the physiological function of the mushroom cytolysins remains enigmatic, recent studies have implied the involvement of hemolytic proteins in the fruiting initiation of some mushrooms. The Aa-Pri1 gene, which encodes a putative 16-kDa protein, has been shown to be specifically expressed in the fruiting initiation of the edible mushroom Agrocybe aegerita (11Fernandez Espinar M. Labarere J. Curr. Genet. 1997; 32: 420-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Aegerolysin was isolated as a 17-kDa hemolytic protein from the basidiocarps of A. aegerita, and it was preferentially detected in the primordia and immature fruiting bodies of the mushroom (12Berne S. Krizaj I. Pohleven F. Turk T. Macek P. Sepcic K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1570: 153-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Lin et al. (9Lin J.Y. Lin Y.J. Chen C.C. Wu H.L. Shi G.Y. Jeng T.W. Nature. 1974; 252: 235-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) isolated a cardiotoxic and cytolytic 22-kDa protein from the basidiocarps of the edible mushroom Flammulina velutipes, and designated it flammutoxin (FTX). 1The abbreviations used are: FTX, flammutoxin; rFTX, recombinant FTX; rFTX271, recombinant FTX consisting of 271 residues; rFTX251, recombinant FTX consisting of 251 residues; TPCK, N-tosyl-L-phenylalanyl-chloromethylketone; PE, S-pyridylethylated; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography; RP-HPLC, reversed phase HPLC; MALDI-TOF MS, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry. 1The abbreviations used are: FTX, flammutoxin; rFTX, recombinant FTX; rFTX271, recombinant FTX consisting of 271 residues; rFTX251, recombinant FTX consisting of 251 residues; TPCK, N-tosyl-L-phenylalanyl-chloromethylketone; PE, S-pyridylethylated; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography; RP-HPLC, reversed phase HPLC; MALDI-TOF MS, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry. Later, Bernheimer and Oppenheim (13Bernheimer A.W. Oppenheim J.D. Toxicon. 1987; 25: 1145-1152Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) purified a hemolytic protein of 32 kDa from the same mushroom and referred to it as FTX on the assumption that the FTX of Lin et al. (9Lin J.Y. Lin Y.J. Chen C.C. Wu H.L. Shi G.Y. Jeng T.W. Nature. 1974; 252: 235-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) derived from their 32-kDa FTX by partial proteolysis. We isolated FTX as a 31-kDa single hemolysin of F. velutipes, determined the N-terminal 28 residues, and studied the molecular basis of the cytolytic action of the protein (14Tomita T. Ishikawa D. Noguchi T. Katayama E. Hashimoto Y. Biochem. J. 1998; 333: 129-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Our results showed that FTX assembles into a ring-shaped oligomer with outer and inner diameters of 10 and 5 nm, respectively, which forms membrane pores with a functional diameter of 4–5 nm and causes an osmotic burst of human erythrocytes (14Tomita T. Ishikawa D. Noguchi T. Katayama E. Hashimoto Y. Biochem. J. 1998; 333: 129-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). By using planar lipid bilayers, we showed that FTX forms a cation-selective, voltage-gated channel with a diameter of 4–5 nm (15Tadjibaeva G. Sabirov R. Tomita T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1467: 431-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Watanabe et al. (16Watanabe H. Narai A. Shimizu M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 262: 850-857Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) purified a 30-kDa transepithelial electrical resistance-decreasing protein from the basidiocarps of F. velutipes, which increased tight junctional permeability of human intestinal Caco-2 monolayers. The N-terminal amino acid sequence of the purified protein was identical with that of FTX reported by us (14Tomita T. Ishikawa D. Noguchi T. Katayama E. Hashimoto Y. Biochem. J. 1998; 333: 129-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 16Watanabe H. Narai A. Shimizu M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 262: 850-857Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Watanabe et al. (16Watanabe H. Narai A. Shimizu M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 262: 850-857Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) cloned a cDNA encoding a 272-residue protein (AB012289) and concluded that the cloned cDNA encodes the transepithelial electrical resistance-decreasing protein, because N-terminal sequence and molecular mass of the predicted protein coincided with those of the purified protein (16Watanabe H. Narai A. Shimizu M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 262: 850-857Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). However, they did not express the cloned cDNA. Concurrently with their cloning, we cloned a cDNA encoding the same protein (GenBank™ accession number AB015948) and expressed the cDNA in Escherichia coli but failed to obtain hemolytically active recombinant protein. Taken together with the fact that F. velutipes produces multiple FTX family proteins with N-terminal sequences similar to that of FTX (described below), it remained uncertain that the cloned cDNAs encode FTX or the transepithelial electrical resistance-decreasing protein. This prompted us to determine the complete primary structure of FTX by protein sequence analysis. Sakamoto et al. (17Sakamoto Y. Azuma T. Ando A. Tamai Y. Miura K. Mycoscience. 2000; 41: 279-282Crossref Scopus (1) Google Scholar) studied expression of genes in different developmental stages of F. velutipes and cloned C1 cDNA (GenBank™ accession number AB030006), which was specifically expressed during the fruiting body formation. A search on the DDBJ/GenBank™/EBI nucleotide sequence data bases indicated that the C1 cDNA is identical with the cDNAs cloned by us and by Watanabe et al. (16Watanabe H. Narai A. Shimizu M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 262: 850-857Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The same group also analyzed chronological expression of proteins in F. velutipes by using two-dimensional electrophoresis and showed that four 30–32-kDa proteins, which had N-terminal sequences similar to that of FTX, were abundantly expressed in the fruiting bodies of F. velutipes (17Sakamoto Y. Azuma T. Ando A. Tamai Y. Miura K. Mycoscience. 2000; 41: 279-282Crossref Scopus (1) Google Scholar). Furthermore, cDNAs identical with FTX cDNA were cloned from Hericium erinaceum, Agrocybe chaxingu, Pleurotus eryngi var. ferulae, Coprinus comatus, and Ganoderma lucidum, which cover different families of Basidiomycetes (GenBank™ accession numbers AY281063–AY281067). Thus, FTX and/or FTX family proteins are produced by F. velutipes and other mushrooms during the fruiting body formation. In this study, we determined the complete primary structure of FTX by protein sequence analysis. As a result, protein and nucleotide sequences were in accord except for the lack of the initial Met and the C-terminal 20 residues in protein. Based on the sequence information obtained, we constructed expression systems for production of rFTXs of precursor and mature forms and studied the maturation process of FTX. Materials—Basidiocarps of F. velutipes were purchased from the producers in Gunma and Miyagi Prefecture and stored at –40 °C. The sources of other materials and chemicals used were as follows: N-tosyl-l-phenylalanyl-chloromethylketone (TPCK)-treated trypsin from Cooper Biomedical (Malvern, PA); S. aureus V8 protease from ICN Biomedicals (Costa Mesa, CA); endoproteinase Asp-N from Roche Applied Science; cyanogen bromide and tri-n-butyl phosphine from Wako Pure Chemical (Osaka, Japan); hydroxylamine HCl from Kanto Chemical (Tokyo, Japan); and 4-vinylpyridine from Tokyo Kasei (Tokyo, Japan). Achromobacter protease I was kindly supplied by Dr. T. Masaki of Ibaraki University (Ibaraki, Japan). Other chemicals used were of analytical grade. Purification and S-Alkylation of FTX—FTX was purified from the basidiocarps of F. velutipes as described (14Tomita T. Ishikawa D. Noguchi T. Katayama E. Hashimoto Y. Biochem. J. 1998; 333: 129-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). FTX was reduced and pyridylethylated (PE) as described (18Nonaka T. Dohmae N. Hashimoto Y. Takio K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30032-30039Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Chemical Cleavages—Methionyl bonds of PE-FTX were cleaved according to the method of Gross (19Gross E. Methods Enzymol. 1967; 11: 238-255Crossref Scopus (759) Google Scholar) with 1% (w/v) CNBr in 70% (v/v) formic acid. Asparaginyl-glycine bonds of PE-FTX were cleaved with 2 m hydroxylamine, as described by Bornstein and Balian (20Bornstein P. Balian G. Methods Enzymol. 1977; 47: 132-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). Aspartylproline bonds of PE-FTX were hydrolyzed in 1% (v/v) formic acid at 40 °C for 72.5 h, according of the method of Landon (21Landon M. Methods Enzymol. 1977; 47: 145-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). T7k peptide was hydrolyzed in 12 m HCl at room temperature for 15 h, as described by Titani and Narita (22Titani K. Narita K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1964; 56: 241-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Enzymatic Cleavages—PE-FTX was digested with Achromobacter protease I in 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 9.0) containing 2 m urea at 37 °C for 18 h at an enzyme/substrate molar ratio of 1:100. PE-FTX was digested with S. aureus V8 protease at 37 °C for 18 h in 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.8) containing 1.5 m urea and 2 mm EDTA at an enzyme/substrate molar ratio of 1:30. FTX was digested with TPCK-treated trypsin at 37 °C for 18 h in 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.3) containing 4 m urea and 10 mm CaCl2 at an enzyme/substrate molar ratio of 1:10. T7k peptide was digested by S. aureus V8 protease or thermolysin at 37 °C for 18 h in 100 mm ammonium bicarbonate buffer (pH 7.8 or 8.2) containing 2 mm EDTA or 2 m urea plus 5 mm CaCl2, respectively, at an enzyme/substrate molar ratio of 1:10. M2 peptide was cleaved with endoproteinase Asp-N at 37 °C for 18 h in 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 8.0) containing 2 m urea at an enzyme/substrate weight ratio of 1:50. Separation of Peptides—Peptides generated by enzymatic and chemical cleavages were separated by gel permeation chromatography (GPC) on tandem columns of TSKgel G2000SWXL and TSKgel G3000SWXL (7.8 × 300 mm each; Tosoh, Tokyo) using a Gilson model 302 pump and a Hewlett Packard HP 1040M diode array detection system. Elution was conducted with 10 mm phosphate buffer (pH 6.0) containing 6 m guanidine HCl at a flow rate of 0.4 ml/min, and the effluent was monitored at 215, 260, 275, and 290 nm. The peptide fractions obtained were passed through a Sephadex G-25 fine column and were further separated by reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) using a Gilson HPLC system or a Hewlett Packard model 1090M liquid chromatograph on an Aquapore RP-300 (4.6 × 100 or 4.6 × 100 mm; Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA), an Aquapore PH-300 (2.1 × 30 mm; Applied Biosystems), a TSKgel super ODS column (2.0 × 48 mm; Tosoh), or a Nova-Pak C18 column (3.9 × 300 mm; Waters Co., Milford, MA). Peptides were eluted with a linear gradient of acetonitrile (0–80%) in 0.09% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid at a flow rate of 0.5 or 0.2 ml/min. Amino Acid Composition and Amino Acid Sequence Analyses—Compositional analyses were performed by precolumn derivatization with a Waters Pico-Tag system (23Bidlingmeyer B.A. Cohen S.A. Tarvin T.L. J. Chromatogr. 1984; 336: 93-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (2105) Google Scholar). The samples (50–100 pmol) were hydrolyzed in vapor phase of 6 m HCl containing 0.1% (w/v) phenol at 110 °C for 20 h. Automated Edman degradation was performed with an Applied Biosystem model 477A or model 493A protein sequencer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Mass Spectrometry—Matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) for proteins and peptides was performed on REFLEX (Bruker Daltonics, Bremen, Germany) with sinapinic acid or α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid as a matrix. Nomenclature of Peptides—Peptides were abbreviated by a serial number prefixed with letter(s). The letters indicate the type of digestion as follows: M, cyanogen bromide; K, Achromobacter protease I; T, trypsin; E, S. aureus V8 protease; D, endoproteinase Asp-N; Th, thermolysin; NG, hydroxylamine; DP, 1% (v/v) formic acid. Secondary fragmentation products are indicated by hyphenation. The numbers in the peptide abbreviation do not correspond to the order of elution in HPLC but rather to their relative positions in the protein sequence, starting from the N terminus. Amplification of the FTX cDNA by Reverse Transcription-PCR— Total RNAs were isolated from the basidiocarps of F. velutipes using the RNAgents total RNA isolation system (Promega, Madison, WI) and were used as the templates. The sense primers (i.e. 5′-ATGGATCCICARGTIAARACITCITGGGARGAYYT-3′, where I, R, and Y indicate inosine, G/A, and T/C, respectively, and the underline indicates the BamHI site) were synthesized based on the N-terminal amino acid sequence of FTX (14Tomita T. Ishikawa D. Noguchi T. Katayama E. Hashimoto Y. Biochem. J. 1998; 333: 129-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The antisense primer was 5′-GCAAGCTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTT-3′, where the underline indicates a HindIII site. After a reverse transcription using the oligo(dT) primer, 35 cycles of PCR were performed using Taq polymerase (TaKaRa, Kyoto, Japan). Amplified fragments of ∼1 kbp were inserted into the SmaI site of pUC118 and sequenced. The resultant plasmid was designated pUF1. Amplification of the 5′-End of the FTX cDNA by Reverse Transcription-PCR—After the reverse transcription of the total RNAs using the oligo(dT) primer described above, oligo(dA) was added to the 3′-ends of the reverse transcripts by using terminal deoxyribonucleotidyl transferase (TaKaRa). The 5′-end of the FTX cDNA was amplified by a PCR using the oligo(dT) primer and an antisense primer (i.e. 5′-CGCTCAATGGAAACTATCTCACGA-3′, which corresponds to the segment from the 469th to the 498th nucleotide of the FTX cDNA; Fig. 7). Amplified DNA fragments of ∼600 bp were cloned into the SmaI site of pUC118 and sequenced. The resultant plasmid was designated pUF-N. Construction of Expression Plasmids—The FTX cDNA was inserted into the NcoI site of pTrc99A (Amersham Biosciences) to produce rFTX with the same N-terminal sequence as that of FTX. The pUF1 was digested with EcoRI and HindIII, the resultant EcoRI-HindIII fragments were inserted into pTrc99A, and the cloned pTrc99A was designated pTF3. The pTF3 was digested with NcoI, blunted, and digested with SalI. To amplify the DNA segment from the 4th to the 413th nucleotide of the FTX cDNA (which corresponds to the N-terminal 135 amino acid residues of FTX; the nucleotide numbering is according to Fig. 7), a PCR was performed using the pUF-N as the template and the following primers. The sense primer was 5′-CCTCAAGTCAAGACAAGTTGGGAGGATCTC-3′, which corresponds to the N-terminal 10 amino acid residues of FTX (Fig. 7), and the antisense primer was 5′-GGTGTCGACTCCGTAGAAATCGAAATCTCG-3′, corresponding to the segment from the 387th to the 413th nucleotide (where the underline indicates a SalI site and nucleotide numbering is according to Fig. 7). Amplified DNA fragments of ∼400 bp were digested with SalI and ligated with the SalI-digested pTF3 possessing the blunt end of the NcoI site. The resultant plasmid for expression of FTX precursor was designated pFTX272. To construct an expression system for mature FTX, the DNA segment, which contained the FTX cDNA fragment from the 337th to the 756th nucleotide and a stop codon, was amplified by a PCR using pFTX272 as the template and the following primers. The sense primer was 5′-ATTCTGCAGTTGAGTCAGTCGATCACC-3′ (where the underline indicates the PstI site and the segment from the 337th to the 360th nucleotide is included; the nucleotide numbering is according to Fig. 6), and the antisense primer was 5′-CTCAAGCTTTCACTTCACCGTCAAAGGGGCAG-3′ (where the underline and the double underline indicate the HindIII site and a stop codon, respectively, followed by the segment corresponding to the 737th to the 756th nucleotide). Amplified DNA fragments of ∼400 bp were digested with PstI and HindIII and ligated with the double-digested pFTX272 with PstI and HindIII. The resultant plasmid was designated pFTX252. DNA Sequencing—The cycle-sequencing reaction was performed with Sequi Therm Long Read cycle sequencing kits containing M13 forward and reverse IR-dyeprimers (Epicenter Technologies, Madison, WI). A Long Read IR DNA sequencing system (Li-Cor model 4000L; Li-Cor Inc., Lincoln, NE) was used for sequencing. The resultant sequences were analyzed using the GENETYX software package. A similarity search for nucleotide sequences was performed on the DDBJ/GenBank™/EBI nucleotide sequence databases. Expression, Renaturation, and Purification of rFTX—E. coli DH5α cells harboring pFTX272 or pFTX252 were grown at 37 °C in 2× YT medium (1.6% Bacto-Trypton, 1% Bacto-Yeast extract, and 0.5% NaCl; Difco) with ampicillin (100 μg/ml). When optical density at 660 nm of the culture reached 0.4, isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactoside was added at 1 mm. After further cultivation for 4 h, bacteria were collected by centrifugation and suspended in 20 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.2) containing 20 mm EDTA and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl chloride. The suspension was passed through a French pressure cell (SLM Instruments Inc., Rochester, NY) at 1200 kg/cm2 and was centrifuged at 14,000 × g at 4 °C for 20 min. The precipitates obtained were suspended in 20 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.2), containing 4% (w/v) Triton X-100 and 20 mm EDTA, and incubated at room temperature for 12 h. After centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 20 min, the white precipitates obtained were dissolved in 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.5) containing 8 m urea and incubated at 25 °C for 1 h. Proteins were refolded at 4 °C by the stepwise dialysis against 10 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.5) containing 4, 2, 1, 0.5, or 0 m urea and were loaded onto a TSKgel DEAE-5PW column (7.5 × 200 mm; Tosoh). Adsorbed proteins were eluted with a linear gradient of NaCl (0–300 mm). The FTX fraction, eluted with 120–150 mm NaCl, was mixed with the same volume of 10 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.2) containing ammonium sulfate (40% saturation) and loaded onto a TSKgel Phenyl-5PW column (7.5 × 200 mm; Tosoh). Adsorbed proteins were eluted with a linear gradient of ammonium sulfate (20 to 0% saturation). rFTX251 (i.e. rFTX without the C-terminal 20 residues) was assayed for its hemolytic activity toward human erythrocytes, whereas rFTX271 (i.e. rFTX with the C-terminal 20 residues) was assayed by Western immunoblotting using anti-FTX serum. Protein concentration was assayed as described by Bradford, using bovine serum albumin as a standard (24Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (211946) Google Scholar). Hemolytic Assay—Hemolytic assay was performed as described (14Tomita T. Ishikawa D. Noguchi T. Katayama E. Hashimoto Y. Biochem. J. 1998; 333: 129-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Human erythrocytes (3 × 107 cells/ml) were incubated with rFTX (the final concentrations 0.1–100 μg/ml) at 25 °C for 30 min. After centrifugation at 600 × g for 5 min, the supernatants obtained were assayed for absorbance at 541 nm. 100% lysis was defined as the absorbance of the supernatants obtained from the osmotically lysed cells. One hemolytic unit was defined as the amount of FTX, which caused 50% hemolysis under the conditions described. Cross-linking of rFTX with Glutaraldehyde—rFTX271 or rFTX251 (final concentration of each protein 5.0 or 4.6 μg/ml, respectively) was treated with 0.05% (w/v) glutaraldehyde at 20 °C for 20 min as described (25Sugawara-Tomita N. Tomita T. Kamio Y. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 4747-4756Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The glutaraldehyde-treated rFTX was heated in the presence of 2% (w/v) SDS and 5% 2-mercaptoethanol at 100 °C for 5 min and subjected to Western immunoblotting using anti-FTX serum as described (14Tomita T. Ishikawa D. Noguchi T. Katayama E. Hashimoto Y. Biochem. J. 1998; 333: 129-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Assembly of rFTX into Membrane Pore Complex—Complex formation by rFTX was assayed as described (14Tomita T. Ishikawa D. Noguchi T. Katayama E. Hashimoto Y. Biochem. J. 1998; 333: 129-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). rFTX (0.5–2.0 μg) was incubated with human erythrocytes (1.0 × 108 cells) in 1 ml of Tris-buffered saline at 25 °C for 30 min. The erythrocytes were washed twice with 5 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.2, and the erythrocyte membranes obtained were solubilized in 2% (w/v) SDS at 25 °C for 5 min. The solubilized membranes were subjected to Western immunoblotting using anti-FTX serum. Isolation and Electron Microscopy of Pore Complexes—Pore complexes of rFTX were isolated and analyzed by electron microscopy as described (10Tomita T. Noguchi K. Mimuro H. Ukaji F. Ito K.

Biochem. J. 1998; 333: 129-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Human erythrocytes (3 × 109 cells) were incubated with rFTX271 or rFTX251 (50 μg of each) in 50 ml of Tris-buffered saline at 25 °C for 30 min. Erythrocyte membranes were collected and solubilized with 2% SDS (w/v) at 25 °C and loaded onto a 10–40% (w/w) sucrose gradient in 10 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.2) containing 0.1% SDS. Centrifugation was performed using a Beckman SW40Ti rotor at 32,000 rpm for 19 h at 4 °C. Fractions were analyzed by Western immunoblotting using anti-FTX serum. Fractions containing the pore complexes were stained negatively with 1% (w/v) sodium phosphotungstic acid (pH 7.2) and examined under an electron microscope H-8100 (Hitachi, Tokyo, Japan) at an acceleration voltage of 80 kV. Trypsin Digestion of rFTX271—rFTX271 (100 μg/ml) was treated with TPCK-treated trypsin (10 μg/ml) in 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.0) at 37 °C for 0–24 h. Small portions were withdrawn and mixed with soybean trypsin inhibitor (final concentration, 100 μg/ml) and were subjected to SDS-PAGE or hemolytic assay. For MALDI-TOF MS, rFTX271 (28 μg/ml) was treated with TPCK-treated trypsin (0.4 μg/ml) at 37 °C for 4 or 24 h, and small portions were immediately withdrawn and analyzed as described above. Protein Sequence Analysis of FTX—The strategy used for determination of the complete amino acid sequence of FTX is summarized in Fig. 1. The complete sequence was established on the sequence information of the peptides generated by enzymatic and chemical cleavages of PE-FTX, together with the results of the amino acid compositions and molecular masses of the peptides. The N-terminal 72 residues and the C-terminal 107 residues (i.e. ∼70% of the whole sequence) were sequenced by automated Edman degradation of intact PE-FTX and the fragments arising from PE-FTX by enzymatic digestions with Achromobacter protease I or S. aureus V8 protease and chemical cleavages with CNBr, hydroxylamine, or 1% formic acid (or at methionyl, Asn-Gly, or Asp-Pro bonds). The central part of FTX was completed by analyses of subdigest peptides derived from a surface-adhesive 7-kDa tryptic peptide (T7k) or a CNBr fragment (M2) by digestion with thermolysin, S. aureus V8 protease, or endoproteinase Asp-N. Some overlaps were provided by peptides obtained from T7k by 12 m HCl treatment. The molecular masses of FTX and several selected peptides were determined by MALDI-TOF MS to confirm the sequences obtained by automated Edman degradation. CNBr Cleavage of PE-FTX—Cyanogen bromide fragments arising from PE-FTX (13 nmol) were first fraction"
https://openalex.org/W1601720589,"We as human beings depend greatly on the sensory neurons that govern our sense of touch. If such cells cease to function properly, we may lose the ability to respond to another's touch—say, as a dancer responds to a partner's lead. Additionally, we may be unable to respond to a more painful and potentially damaging event. Reduced touch sensation, or peripheral sensory neuropathy, is especially common in people with diabetes and is a significant contributing factor to lower-extremity amputations (1). Other mechanoreceptor neurons mediate equally vital sensory modalities: proprioception for balance and the control of internal organs, such as the bladder and kidney, and baroreception for homeostatic control of heart rate. Despite the importance of these mechanical senses, however, exactly how sensory cells detect the mechanical energy in a touch, the bend of a limb, or changes in blood vessel diameter remains a mystery."
