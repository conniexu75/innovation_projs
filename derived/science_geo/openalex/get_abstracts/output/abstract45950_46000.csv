https://openalex.org/W2030156849,"Insulin stimulates the autophosphorylation of tyrosine residues of the beta subunit of the insulin receptor (IR); this modified insulin-independent kinase has increased activity toward exogenous substrates in vitro. We show here that replacement of one or both of the twin tyrosines (residues 1162 and 1163) with phenylalanine results in a dramatic reduction in or loss of insulin-activated autophosphorylation and kinase activity in vitro. In vivo, these mutations not only result in a substantial decrease in insulin-stimulated IR autophosphorylation but also in a parallel decrease in the insulin-activated uptake of 2-deoxyglucose. Furthermore, a truncated IR protein (lacking the last 112 amino acids) has an unstable beta subunit; this mutant has no kinase activity in vitro or in vivo and does not mediate insulin-stimulated uptake of 2-deoxyglucose. IR autophosphorylation is thus implicated in the regulation of IR activities, with tyrosines 1162 and 1163 as major sites of this regulation."

https://openalex.org/W2066825851,"GCN4 encodes a transcriptional activator of amino acid biosynthetic genes in yeast that is regulated at the translational level. The 5' leader of GCN4 mRNA contains four small open-reading-frames. By constructing point mutations in the initiation codons of these sequences, we show that they are essential for translational repression of GCN4. Each upstream AUG codon can repress translation; however, the two 3' proximal AUG codons are much more inhibitory than the 5' proximal AUG codons. Unexpectedly, the first AUG codon is required for efficient GCN4 expression under starvation conditions. This positive function appears to involve antagonism of the inhibitory effect of the 3' proximal AUG codons since it is dispensable in the absence of these sequences. The interaction between the upstream AUG codons is modulated by the trans-acting factors GCN2 and GCD1 in response to amino acid availability."
https://openalex.org/W2075791686,"We describe studies using a monoclonal antibody that recognizes a 62 kd protein (p62) of rat liver nuclei. This protein remains associated with the nuclear pore complex-lamina fraction resulting from treatment of nuclei with DNAase, RNAase, and nonionic detergent. Immunofluorescence revealed a strikingly punctate pattern of nuclear rim staining. By immunoferritin microscopy, p62 was specifically localized to the pore complex. Thus, pore complexes can be resolved by fluorescence light microscopy. Pulse chase analysis of labeled tissue culture cells showed that p62 is synthesized as a soluble cytoplasmic precursor of 61 kd, which is incorporated into the nuclear fraction with an unusually long t1/2 of about 6 hr. Incorporation is followed by modification that may involve addition of N-acetylglucosamine residues."
https://openalex.org/W2120626070,The cdc2+ gene function has an important role in controlling the commitment of the fission yeast cell to the mitotic cycle and the timing of mitosis. We have raised antibodies against the cdc2+ protein using synthetic peptides and have demonstrated that it is a 34 kd phosphoprotein with protein kinase activity. The protein level and phosphorylation state remain unchanged during the mitotic cycle of rapidly growing cells. When cells cease to proliferate and arrest in G1 the protein becomes dephosphorylated and loses protein kinase activity. Exit from the mitotic cycle and entry into stationary phase may be controlled in part by modulation of the cdc2 protein kinase activity by changes in its phosphorylation state.
https://openalex.org/W2047188621,"Nuclear and cytoplasmic poly(A)-binding proteins have been purified from Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and antisera have been used to isolate a gene that encodes them. The gene occurs in a single copy on chromosome 5 and gives rise to a unique, unspliced 2.1 kb transcript. The nuclear protein appears to be derived from the cytoplasmic one by proteolytic cleavage into 53 and 17 kd polypeptides that remain associated during isolation. DNA sequence determination reveals four tandemly arrayed 90 amino acid regions of homology that probably represent poly(A)-binding domains. A 55 residue A-rich region upstream of the initiator methionine codon in the mRNA shows an affinity for poly(A)-binding protein comparable to that of poly(A)180-220, raising the possibility of feedback regulation of translation."
https://openalex.org/W1625181872,"Tryptase was shown to be stabilized as an enzymatically active tetramer by association with heparin and dissociated to inactive monomers in the absence of heparin at 37 degrees C in physiologic buffer and in plasma. There was a 50% loss of tryptase activity at 37 degrees C by 6-8 min in both physiologic buffer and plasma. When heparin glycosaminoglycan was present, tryptase retained nearly full activity for 2 h in buffer and in plasma. Tryptase activity also decayed under standard assay conditions in the presence of synthetic ester and peptide substrates unless bound to heparin. That tryptase is bound to heparin at the pH and physiologic NaCl concentrations employed was shown by chromatography of tryptase on heparin-agarose, gel filtration, and velocity sedimentation. Elution of tryptase from heparin-agarose occurred at 0.8 M NaCl. Maximal stabilization of tryptase by heparin occurred at a weight ratio to tryptase that was equal to or greater than unity. Kcat/Km ratios for tryptase-heparin at 0.15 M NaCl and 37 degrees C were 0.9 X 10(6) s-1 M-1 for tosyl-L-Gly-Pro-Lys-p-nitroanilide and 1.7 X 10(6) s-1 M-1 for p-tosyl-L-arginine methyl ester and are among the highest reported for tryptic enzymes. The mechanism of heparin-dependent stabilization of tryptase was not due to indirect ion binding properties of heparin and was analyzed by Superose 12 high performance liquid chromatography. Active enzyme eluted with an apparent Mr of 132,000 +/- 10,000 (n = 3, +/- S.D.), whereas tryptase inactivated by incubation without heparin eluted with an apparent Mr of 34,000. The tetrameric structure of diisopropyl fluorophosphate-inhibited tryptase was also preserved after incubation with heparin at 37 degrees C but was reduced to monomeric subunits after incubation without heparin. That no appreciable degradation of tryptase occurs under conditions that cause dissociation of subunits was directly shown by electrophoresis in sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels. Two different subunits of 34,000 and 33,000 Mr (after reduction) present in the intact enzyme (calculated to be 134,000 Mr) were also detected unchanged after inactivation of tryptase by dissociation of its subunits. Thus, the selective localization and association of heparin and tryptase in the human mast cell secretory granule most likely plays a major role in the regulation of tryptase after secretion."
https://openalex.org/W2085816567,"The gene encoding the histidine-tRNA synthetase (HTS1) has two in-frame translation start sites located 60 bp apart. One set of HTS1 transcripts (long) initiates upstream of both ATG codons, and the other set (short) initiates between the two ATG codons and therefore contains only the downstream ATG. A mutation that destroys the first AUG on the long message results in the Pet− (respiratory deficient) phenotype, but does not affect either the level of the cytoplasmic histidine-tRNA synthetase or viability. Mutations distal to the second ATG lead to loss of cytoplasmic synthetase function, lethality and respiratory deficiency. These phenotypes can be explained if the longer message were to encode the mitochondrial synthetase and the shorter message were to encode the cytoplasmic histidine-tRNA synthetase."
https://openalex.org/W2078867563,"Neural control of bone metabolism and growth has been suggested, although the identity of participating neurons and neurotransmitters effecting this control has not been established. Immunohistochemical studies demonstrated a system of vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP)-immunoreactive nerve fibers that innervate periosteum and bone in several mammalian species. Thoracic sympathetic chain ganglionectomy resulted in an ipsilateral loss of VIP-immunoreactive fibers in the periosteum of ribs, whereas dorsal root ganglionectomy had no effect. Injection of fast blue into rib periosteum labeled a population of VIP-immunoreactive sympathetic postganglionic neurons. Thus, postganglionic sympathetic neurons may provide an important means by which VIP regulates bone mineralization."
https://openalex.org/W1975404363,"Glutamate decarboxylase (GAD; E.C. 4.1.1.15) converts glutamate to λ-aminobutyric acid (GABA), the major inhibitory neurotransmitter in the vertebrate central nervous system. This report describes the isolation of a GAD complementary DNA clone by immunological screening of a λgt-11 brain complementary DNA expression library. The fusion protein produced by this clone catalyzes the conversion of glutamate to GABA and carbon dioxide, confirming its identity as GAD. Antibodies to β-galactosidase remove GAD enzymatic activity from solution, showing that this activity is associated with the fusion protein. In immunoblotting experiments all three available antisera to GAD reacted with the fusion polypeptide and with two major polypeptides (molecular size, 60,000 and 66,000 daltons) in brain extracts."
https://openalex.org/W2044007804,"Genes that are expressed exclusively in cytotoxic T cells should encode proteins that are essential for target cell lysis in cell-mediated immune responses. The sequences of two cytotoxic T lymphocyte-specific complementary DNA's (cDNA's) suggest that the two genes encode serine proteases. A full-length cDNA corresponding to one of the genes was isolated and sequenced. The predicted protein resembles serine proteases in that it includes all the residues that form the catalytic triad of the active site of serine proteases. Moreover, it has sequence characteristics thought to occur only in rat mast cell protease type II. These results are in accord with the view that a protease cascade plays a key role in cytotoxic T-cell activation."
https://openalex.org/W1971916660,"Hsp26 is one of the major heat shock proteins of eukaryotic cells. It is also strongly induced at particular times during development at normal temperatures. We have isolated the unique gene for this protein from the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and we have used it to create disruption and deletion mutations. Surprisingly, the mutations have no detectable effect on the following characteristics: growth rates at various temperatures, in fermentative or in respiratory metabolism, in rich or in minimal media; the acquisition of thermotolerance in log phase or in stationary phase cells; resistance to ethanol; spore development; thermoresistance during sporulation; spore germination; thermoresistance of mature or germinating spores; or survival after long-term storage in stationary phase or as spores."
https://openalex.org/W1541008516,"Computer modeling suggested that a disulfide bond could be built into Bacillus amyloliquefaciens subtilisin between positions 22 (wild-type, Thr) and 87 (Ser) or between positions 24 (Ser) and 87 (Ser). Single cysteines were introduced into this cysteine-free protease at positions 22, 24, or 87 by site-directed mutagenesis of the cloned subtilisin gene. The corresponding double-cysteine mutants were constructed, and recombinant plasmids were expressed in Bacillus subtilis. Double-cysteine mutant enzymes were secreted as efficiently as wild-type, and disulfide bonds were formed quantitatively in vivo. These disulfide bonds were introduced approximately 24 A away from the catalytic site and had no detectable effect on either the specific activities or the pH optima of the mutant enzymes. The equilibrium constants for the reduction of the mutant disulfide bonds by dithiothreitol were determined to be 82 +/- 22 and 20 +/- 5 for Cys22/Cys87 and Cys24/Cys87, respectively. Studies of autoproteolytic inactivation of wild-type subtilisin support a relationship between autolytic stability and conformational stability of the protein. The stabilities of Cys24/Cys87 and wild-type enzymes to autolysis were essentially the same; however, Cys22/Cys87 was actually less stable to autolysis. Reduction of the disulfide cross-bridge lowered the autolytic stability of both double-cysteine mutants relative to their disulfide forms. This correlates with a lowered autolytic stability for the Cys22 and Cys87 single-cysteine mutants, and the fact that an intramolecular hydrogen bond between the hydroxyl groups of Thr22 and Ser87 is likely to be disrupted in the Cys22 and Cys87 single-cysteine mutant proteins."
https://openalex.org/W2156920104,"Sequences between a pair of divergently transcribed histone genes in Saccharomyces cerevisiae are able to confer periodic transcription during the cell cycle. This conclusion contrasts to our previous hypothesis that an ars (autonomously replicating sequence) 3′ to this locus is a transcription timer for yeast histone genes. The promoter sequences required for periodic expression have been localized by deletion analysis, and isolated elements have been analyzed by insertion into a heterologous promoter. Two cell-cycle-specific promoter functions have been identified. One function activates transcription in a cell-cycle-dependent manner. The other periodically represses transcription. Negative regulation may be the predominant form of cell-cycle control, because removal of the repressing function results in constitutive expression of the histone genes."
https://openalex.org/W2076812520,"To map the structural features responsible for the 5-fold difference in stability of the E. coli ompA and bla gene transcripts, we have constructed gene fusions that encode chimeric ompA/bla transcripts and a deletion that eliminates a large internal segment of bla mRNA. Shortening of bla transcripts by internal deletion or replacement of the 3′ end with the corresponding segment of the ompA transcript had little effect on bla mRNA stability. However, fusion of a 5′-terminal 147 nucleotide segment of the ompA message 5′ to full-length or truncated bla transcripts increased the half-life of the bla segments 3- to 5-fold. These and other findings indicate that E. coli transcripts contain discrete structural determinants of stability and instability that can influence the decay rate of linked mRNA segments derived from other genes."
https://openalex.org/W1596968588,"Calmodulin-dependent myosin light chain kinase phosphorylates two light chain subunits on each myosin molecule. We have developed a method for measuring nonphosphorylated, monophosphorylated, and diphosphorylated forms of myosin in smooth muscle. Four protein bands were separated in tissue extracts by nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in the presence of pyrophosphate. Immunoblots demonstrated that three forms (designated M, MP, and MP2) reacted with rabbit antisera prepared against the purified phosphorylatable light chain (P-light chain) from bovine tracheal smooth muscle. Evidence was obtained that M, MP, and MP2 represented nonphosphorylated, monophosphorylated, and diphosphorylated myosin, respectively, and that the other protein band was probably filamin. The formation of different phosphorylated forms of myosin was measured in bovine trachealis strips neurally stimulated from 1.0 to 3.5 s and quick-frozen. There was no detectable MP or MP2 in unstimulated muscles; the extent of P-light chain phosphorylation measured directly was 0.02 +/- 0.01 mol of phosphate/mol of P-light chain. After 2.5-s stimulation, maximal values of 0.63 +/- 0.06 mol of phosphate/mol of P-light chain and 0.40 +/- 0.06 MP2/myosintotal were obtained. During continuous neural stimulation from 1.0 to 3.5 s, the relationship between the extent of P-light chain phosphorylation (measured directly or calculated) and the relative amount of MP2 is consistent with a random phosphorylation process."

https://openalex.org/W2035583578,"We have examined the effect of physical length on the mitotic segregation of artificial chromosomes and fragments of natural yeast chromosomes. Increasing the length of artificial chromosomes decreases the rate at which they are lost during mitosis. We have made fragments of chromosome III by integrating new telomeres at different positions along the length of the chromosome. Chromosome fragments of 42 and 72 kb behave like artificial chromosomes: they are lost in mitosis much more frequently than natural chromosomes. In contrast, a chromosome fragment of 150 kb is as mitotically stable as the full-length chromosome from which it is derived. The structural instability of a short dicentric artificial chromosome demonstrates that, although short artificial chromosomes segregate poorly in mitosis, they do attach to the mitotic spindle. We discuss these results in the context of a model in which chromosome segregation is directed by the intercatenation of the segregating DNA molecules."
https://openalex.org/W1886888420,"The interaction between epinephrine and insulin in modulating in vivo glucose metabolism within individual tissues of the body has not previously been examined. This was investigated using the euglycemic hyperinsulinemic (120 milliunits/liter) clamp combined with administration of [3H]2-deoxyglucose and D-[U-14C]glucose. Epinephrine produced whole body insulin resistance due to increased hepatic glucose output and reduced peripheral glucose disposal. Despite elevated insulin levels liver glycogen content was reduced by 50% during epinephrine infusion (5 nM). However, this effect was transient, occurring predominantly during the initial 60 min of study. These effects were prevented during beta-adrenergic blockade with propranolol and potentiated during alpha 1-adrenergic blockade with prazosin. The most significant effect of epinephrine in peripheral tissues was increased glycogenolysis in both oxidative and glycolytic skeletal muscle. A significant reduction in insulin-mediated [3H]2-deoxyglucose uptake (30%) was evident in 5 of 9 muscles tested during epinephrine infusion. This effect was most pronounced in the more insulin-sensitive oxidative muscles. The latter effect was probably indirectly mediated via increased glycogenolysis--increased accumulation of metabolites--inhibition of hexokinase. In addition, it is evident that insulin-mediated glycogen synthesis occurred during epinephrine infusion. All effects of epinephrine on muscle glucose metabolism were prevented by propranolol but not prazosin. Similar effects to that observed in muscle were not evident in adipose tissue. It is concluded that epinephrine may override many of the actions of insulin in vivo, and most of these effects are mediated via the beta-adrenergic receptor. In the intact rat there may be a complex interaction between alpha- and beta-adrenergic effects in regulating hepatic glucose output."
https://openalex.org/W2063749542,"Two different methods have been devised for the analysis and purification of spliceosomes formed in a yeast in vitro splicing system. The first method relies on the electrophoretic separation of ribonucleoprotein particles in composite acrylamide-agarose gels. A large fraction of added substrate is located in spliceosomes, the formation of which can be shown to be dependent on the presence of both a yeast 5' splice junction and a TACTAAC box on the RNA substrate. The second method relies on oligo(dT)-cellulose chromatography of spliceosomes formed with a polyadenylated substrate. Purification of spliceosomes by either method indicates that at least three small nuclear RNAs, approximately 160, 185, and 215 nucleotides in length, are specifically associated with yeast spliceosomes."
https://openalex.org/W1499490706,"To gain an understanding of the causes of decreased biological activity in insulins bearing amino acid substitutions at position B25 and the importance of the PheB25 side chain in directing hormone-receptor interactions, we have prepared a variety of insulin analogs and have studied both their interactions with isolated canine hepatocytes and their abilities to stimulate glucose oxidation by isolated rat adipocytes. The semisynthetic analogs fall into three structural classes: (a) analogs in which the COOH-terminal 5, 6, or 7 residues of the insulin B-chain have been deleted, but in which the COOH-terminal residue of the B-chain has been derivatized by alpha-carboxamidation; (b) analogs in which PheB25 has been replaced by unnatural aromatic or natural L-amino acids; and (c) analogs in which the COOH-terminal 5 residues of the insulin B-chain have been deleted and in which residue B25 has been replaced by selected alpha-carboxamidated amino acids. Our results showed that (a) insulin residues B26-B30 can be deleted without decrease in biological potency, whereas deletion of residues B25-B30 and B24-B30 causes a marked and cumulative decrease in potency; (b) replacement of PheB25 in insulin by Leu or Ser results in analogs with biological potency even less than that observed when residues B25-B30 are deleted; (c) the side chain bulk of naphthyl(1)-alanine or naphthyl(2)-alanine at position B25 is well tolerated during insulin interactions with receptor, whereas that of homophenylalanine is not; and (d) the decreased biological potency attending substitution of insulin PheB25 by Ala, Ser, Leu, or homophenylalanine is reversed, in part or in total, by deletion of COOH-terminal residues B26-B30. Additional experiments showed that the rate of dissociation of receptor-bound 125I-labeled insulin from isolated hepatocytes is enhanced by incubating cells with insulin or [naphthyl(2)-alanineB25]insulin, but not with analogs in which PheB25 is replaced by serine, leucine, or homophenylalanine; deletion of residues B26-B30, however, results in analogs that enhance the rate of dissociation of receptor-bound insulin in all cases studied. We conclude that (a) steric hindrance involving the COOH-terminal domain of the B chain plays a major role in directing the interaction of insulin with its receptor; (b) the initial negative effect of this domain is reversed upon the filling of a site reflecting interaction of the receptor and the beta-aromatic ring of the PheB25 side chain.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"

https://openalex.org/W1499031338,"Cellular receptors for endothelial cell growth factor (ECGF) have been demonstrated on several cell types by binding of 125I-ECGF in a specific and saturable manner (Schreiber, A. B., Kennedy, J., Kowalski, J., Friesel, R., Mehlman, T., and Maciag, T. (1985) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 82, 6138-6142). Here we report the covalent cross-linking of 125I-ECGF to a polypeptide present on the surface of the plasma membrane of murine lung capillary endothelial cells by the homobifunctional reagent, disuccinimidyl suberate. Cross-linking of cell surface associated 125I-ECGF yields a major polypeptide with an apparent molecular weight of 150,000. Experiments demonstrated that the cross-linked polypeptide complex represents 125I-ECGF covalently bound specifically to a cell surface receptor because: covalent modification of the polypeptide was inhibited by excess, unlabeled ECGF; preincubation of cells with unlabeled ECGF at 37 degrees C significantly reduced cross-linking while incubation at 4 degrees C did not; other polypeptide growth factors do not compete with 125I-ECGF for cross-linking to the ECGF receptor; labeling of the polypeptide did not take place in the absence of DSS; and cells previously shown to have a paucity of ECGF receptors did not yield a cross-linked labeled receptor. These data suggest that the mitogenic events mediated by ECGF occur after occupancy of the specific cell surface polypeptide and suggest that these events are relevant to ECGF-induced signal transduction across the endothelial cell plasma membrane."
https://openalex.org/W2165217024,"The E. coli dnaY gene product is an arginine tRNA. Its 77 nucleotide sequence can be folded into a typical cloverleaf structure with a UCU anticodon corresponding to the rare arginine codon AGA. A dnaY+ plasmid confers overproduction of at least one arginine-accepting minor species of tRNAArg. The dnaY promoter was identified by run-off transcription studies, and the initiating nucleotide was identified by sequencing the 5' end of the in vitro transcript. The primary products in vitro are RNAs of 180 and 190 nucleotides, which presumably are processed in vivo to generate the mature form. Transcription is terminated in vitro, and presumably in vivo, by a rho-dependent process."

https://openalex.org/W2074404363,"The N-terminal ends of histones H2B and H2A have very different sequences and rates of evolution. However, they both extend from the nucleosome core and are positively charged. Short sequences at the C termini of both proteins also differ from each other and appear to be hydrophilic. Deletions at the N and C termini of yeast histones H2B2 and H2A1 do not obviously affect the cell's viability under normal growth conditions. However, deletions at the N termini of both H2B and H2A in the same cell are lethal or result in greatly reduced viability. Even switching portions of the N termini between H2B and H2A to create two chimeric histone proteins within the same cell has no obvious effect on viability. This supports the argument that the N-terminal end of one protein complements the function of the other."
https://openalex.org/W1977275195,"Yeast killer toxin and a component giving immunity to it are both encoded by a gene specifying a single 35 kd precursor polypeptide. This precursor is composed of a leader peptide, the alpha and beta subunits of the secreted toxin, and a glycosylated gamma peptide separating the latter. The toxin subunits are proteolytically processed from the precursor during toxin secretion. Using site-directed mutagenesis, we have identified a region of the precursor gene necessary for expression of the immunity phenotype. This immunity-coding region extends through the C-terminal half of the alpha subunit into the N-terminal part of the gamma glycopeptide. Mutations in other parts of the gene allow full immunity but produce precursors that fail to be processed. The precursor can therefore confer immunity, and we propose that it does so in the wild type by competing with mature toxin for binding to a membrane receptor."
https://openalex.org/W2091411755,"Insulin is a polypeptide hormone of major physiological importance in the regulation of fuel homeostasis in animals (reviewed in refs 1, 2). It is synthesized by the β-cells of pancreatic islets, and circulating insulin levels are regulated by several small molecules, notably glucose, amino acids, fatty acids and certain pharmacological agents. Insulin consists of two polypeptide chains (A and B, linked by disulphide bonds) that are derived from the proteolytic cleavage of proinsulin, generating equimolar amounts of the mature insulin and a connecting peptide (C-peptide). Humans, like most vertebrates, contain one proinsulin gene3,4, although several species, including mice5 and rats6,7, have two highly homologous insulin genes. We have studied the regulation of serum insulin levels and of insulin gene expression by generating a series of transgenic mice containing the human insulin gene. We report here that the human insulin gene is expressed in a tissue-specific manner in the islets of these transgenic mice, and that serum human insulin levels are properly regulated by glucose, amino acids and tolbutamide, an oral hypoglycaemic agent."

https://openalex.org/W1531749456,"We have previously demonstrated that the addition of a stoichiometric excess of the beta subunit of Escherichia coli DNA polymerase III holoenzyme to DNA polymerase III or holoenzyme itself can lead to an ATP-independent increase in the processivity of these enzyme forms (Crute, J. J., LaDuca, R. J., Johanson, K. O., McHenry, C. S., and Bambara, R. A. (1983) J. Biol. Chem. 258, 11344-11349). Here, we show that the beta subunit can interact directly with the catalytic core of the holoenzyme, DNA polymerase III, generating a new form of the enzyme with enhanced catalytic and processive capabilities. The addition of saturating levels of the beta subunit to the core DNA polymerase III enzyme results in as much as a 7-fold stimulation of synthetic activity. Two populations of DNA products were generated by the DNA polymerase III X beta enzyme complex. Short products resulting from the addition of 5-10 nucleotides/primer fragment were generated by DNA polymerase III in the presence and absence of added beta subunit. A second population of much longer products was generated only in beta-supplemented DNA polymerase III reactions. The DNA polymerase III-beta reaction was inhibited by single-stranded DNA binding protein and was unaffected by ATP, distinguishing it from the holoenzyme-catalyzed reaction. Complex formation of the DNA polymerase III core enzyme with beta increased the residence time of the enzyme on synthetic DNA templates. Our results demonstrate that the beta stimulation of DNA polymerase III can be attributed to a more efficient and highly processive elongation capability of the DNA polymerase III X beta complex. They also prove that at least part of beta's normal contribution to the DNA polymerase III holoenzyme reaction takes place through interaction with DNA polymerase III core enzyme components to produce the essential complex necessary for efficient elongation in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W1661373867,"The enzyme exonuclease I from Escherichia coli hydrolyzes successive nucleotides from the 3'-termini of single-stranded deoxyribonucleotide homopolymers. When the reaction is stopped after partial hydrolysis, only intact starting material and small oligomers can be isolated. The distribution of oligomeric products varies with the base composition of the polymer but the largest oligomer that can be isolated from the reaction of exonuclease I with homopolymers of deoxyadenylate, deoxythymidylate, or deoxycytidylate is a decamer. These results suggest a model in which exonuclease I possesses at least two nucleotide binding sites. When both sites are filled, with 11-mers and longer polymers, the enzyme does not dissociate from the polymer during hydrolysis. When, with smaller oligomers, only a single site is filled, the reaction partitions at each oligomer between hydrolysis and dissociation. The kinetics of the reactions of exonuclease I with purified polydeoxyriboadenylates of defined size distributions have been investigated. The maximum rates of hydrolysis are nearly independent of polymer size while the apparent Michaelis constants are inversely proportional to the polymer size. A simple steady state model yields a kinetic equation that is consistent with our results. Competition experiments indicate that the rate at which exonuclease I associates with the 3'-terminus of a polydeoxyribonucleotide is independent of the polymer's chain length."
https://openalex.org/W1589773429,"The substrate binding reaction of the melibiose carrier was analyzed by studying [3H]p-nitrophenyl-alpha-D-galactopyranoside (Np alpha Gal) binding to de-energized membrane vesicles from Escherichia coli RA11 as a function of H+ and Na+ (or Li+) concentrations. The data indicate first that Na+ (or Li+) activates Np alpha Gal binding at all pH values tested between 5.5 and 7.5 and second that H+ inhibits the Na+ (or Li+)-dependent activating effect on Np alpha Gal binding. Similar conclusions were drawn for melibiose and methyl-1-thio-beta-D-galactoside binding activities. Unexpectedly, Np alpha Gal, melibiose, and methyl-1-thio-beta-D-galactoside binding activities are insensitive to a variety of SH reagents which completely block transport activity. Quantitative analysis of the effects of H+ and Na+ ions on the parameters of Np alpha Gal binding show that 1) the maximal number of binding sites is constant irrespective of the concentration of Na+ or Li+ in the range of pH between 6 and 7.5 and 2) the apparent dissociation constant for Np alpha Gal binding varies with both Na+ and H+ according to a relation described by a linear combination of the concentration of H+ and the reciprocal of Na+ concentration. These results can be accounted for by a model which assumes sequential binding of the cation and substrate in this order and competition between Na+ and H+ for a common cationic binding site on the porter. Predictions of the proposed binding model for a carrier mechanism catalyzing sugar transport according to a Na+ symport mode or a H+ symport mode are discussed."

https://openalex.org/W2155075915,"In order to explore the molecular basis for the glycopeptide specificity of legume lectins, we have developed an experimental system in which specific amino acid alterations can be introduced into the carbohydrate binding site of pea lectin. This system is based on the production of pea lectin in Escherichia coli. The plasmid coding for the lectin was constructed from two lectin cDNA sequences isolated from Pisum sativum seeds (Higgins, T. J. V., Chandler, P. M., Zurawski, G., Button, S. C., and Spencer, D. (1983) J. Biol. Chem. 258, 9544-9549) and an expression vector based on the gene for the outer membrane lipoprotein of E. coli (Nakamura, K., and Inouye, M. (1982) EMBO J. 1, 771-775). The lectin is produced as a single polypeptide chain and forms insoluble aggregates in E. coli cells (2-5 mg/liter). Functional lectin is recovered by solubilization of the aggregates in guanidinium hydrochloride, renaturation in the presence of MnCl2 and CaCl2, and affinity purification on Sephadex. This procedure yields a homogeneous 28,000-dalton protein. Comparison of the recombinant lectin with natural pea lectin in an inhibition of hemagglutination assay demonstrated that there is no detectable difference in the carbohydrate binding properties of the two lectins."

Similar kinetics of clearance from the rat circulation were observed for albumin labeled conventionally with 125I or 125I-DLT-albumin, both proteins having circulating half-lives of approximately 2.2 days. In contrast, the recovery of whole body radioactivity had half-lives of approximately 2.2 and 5.1 days, respectively, for the two protein preparations, indicating substantial retention of degradation products derived from catabolism of 125I-DLT-albumin. Measurement of total and acid-soluble radioactivity in tissues 2 or 4 days after injection of 125I-DLT-albumin revealed that skin and muscle accounted for the largest fraction (50-60%) of degradation products in the body. Fibroblasts were identified by autoradiography as the major cell type containing radioactive degradation products in skin and muscle. Fibroblasts were isolated from skin by collagenase digestion, followed by density gradient centrifugation. The amount of acid-soluble radioactivity recovered in these cells was in excellent agreement with that predicted based on acid precipitation of solubilized whole skin preparations. These studies demonstrate for the first time that fibroblasts are a major cell type involved in the degradation of albumin in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W1658148979,"The cloned Escherichia coli cca gene, described in the accompanying paper (Cudny, H., Lupski, J. R., Godson, G. N., and Deutscher, M. P. (1986) J. Biol. Chem. 261, 6444-6449), has been used to construct strains that overproduce tRNA nucleotidyltransferase, the enzyme that synthesizes the CCA terminus of tRNA. Strain UT481 (pEC4), which contains a 1.9-kilobase cca gene insert in plasmid pUC8, overproduces the enzyme by about 100-150-fold, probably under the control of the cca gene promoter. A second strain, containing a plasmid with a 1.5-kilobase insert, overproduces tRNA nucleotidyltransferase by about 650-fold, to a level of about 3-4% of the soluble cell protein. In this case, overexpression was dependent on the lac promoter of the plasmid. A rapid, two-step procedure was developed to purify large amounts of the enzyme from strain UT481 (pEC4) that was about 40% pure, free of ribonucleases, and suitable for use as a reagent for modification of tRNA molecules. Preparation of milligram quantities of homogeneous tRNA nucleotidyltransferase was accomplished by two further chromatographic steps. The structural and catalytic properties of this purified enzyme were similar to those from partially purified preparations previously described. The availability of large amounts of pure tRNA nucleotidyltransferase will not permit a variety of structural and functional studies of the enzyme that previously were not possible."

https://openalex.org/W114751351,"Differences in the processing of dimeric tRNASer-tRNAMet precursors derived from the Schizosaccharomyces pombe sup9 wild-type and opal suppressor genes can be attributed to conformational alterations in the tRNASer anticodon/intron domain. A comparison of the patterns obtained upon transcription of the sup9+ (wild-type) and sup9-e (opal suppressor) genes in a coupled transcription/processing extract from Saccharomyces cerevisiae reveals that the latter exhibits a greatly reduced efficiency of 5'-end maturation and is susceptible to specific endonucleolytic cleavage(s) within the intron. Free energy calculations indicate that these effects coincide with a destabilization of the wild-type anticodon/intron stem and suggest that the predominant sup9-e conformer lacks secondary structure in this region. Evidence in support of this hypothesis was obtained by analyzing the processing of sup9+ and sup9-e precursors carrying the intron base substitution, G37:10, which destroys and restores, respectively, the base-pairing potential of the proposed secondary structure and comparing the strength and temperature sensitivity of sup9-e and sup9-e G37:10 suppression in vivo in S. cerevisiae. The data indicate that the anticodon/intron structure of tRNA precursors can influence the rate of RNase P cleavage in vitro and affect tRNA expression in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W1530783230,"Phosphatidylcholine metabolism was investigated in Nb 2 rat node lymphoma cells, a cell line which is dependent on prolactin for growth in culture. Treatment of stationary cultures with prolactin stimulated the incorporation of [methyl-3H]choline into phosphatidylcholine (1.7-fold after 4 h) and its aqueous precursors, mainly phosphocholine (1.9-fold after 4 h and 2.7-fold after 10 h). These effects were blocked by cycloheximide. Pulse-chase studies demonstrated that the reaction catalyzed by CTP:choline-phosphate cytidylyltransferase (EC 2.7.7.15) was rate-limiting for phosphatidylcholine synthesis in Nb 2 cells and that the rate of this reaction was not altered by prolactin treatment. The cell-free activity of choline kinase (EC 2.7.1.32) was found to increase in correspondence with the increase in choline incorporation. This induction of choline kinase was also blocked by cycloheximide. The activities of the other enzymes of phosphatidylcholine synthesis were unchanged. These results suggest that phosphatidylcholine biosynthesis was not altered in Nb 2 cells after prolactin treatment. However, phosphatidylcholine levels increased in prolactin-treated cells (1.4-fold after 16 h). Turnover of labeled phosphatidylcholine was markedly reduced in prolactin-treated cells. Calculated turnover rates for phosphatidylcholine averaged 4.2-fold lower in prolactin-treated cells, whereas the synthetic rates were similar in prolactin-treated and stationary cells. Thus, Nb 2 cells utilize a novel mechanism, reduction of turnover, to regulate the cellular levels of phosphatidylcholine during growth."
https://openalex.org/W1584318361,"The role of the rat liver plasma membrane in the regulation of uptake and subsequent deiodination of thyroxine (T4) or the biologically active thyroid hormone 3,3',5-triiodothyronine (T3) was investigated. Here we report on the production of monoclonal antibodies raised against rat hepatocytes. Two antibodies were selected. Antibody ER-22 did bind to a Mr 52,000 membrane protein and inhibited the 1- and 5-min uptake of both T4 and T3 by primary cultured rat hepatocytes in a dose-dependent fashion. As the uptake of T4 and T3 depends on the presence of a sodium gradient over the plasma membrane, the inhibitory potency of ER-22 on the Na+,K+-ATPase activity was investigated. No inhibition of the uptake of 86Rb+ could be determined, indicating that antibody ER-22 is not directed against the Na+,K+-ATPase but probably the carrier protein itself. Clearance of T3 from the medium and concomitant iodide production by cultured rat hepatocytes during a 20-h incubation in the presence of ER-22 were both inhibited by 50% with respect to a control incubation in the absence of monoclonal antibody, pointing to the importance of carrier-mediated transport in cellular uptake and metabolism of T3. A second monoclonal antibody did bind to two other plasma membrane proteins but did not inhibit transport of thyroid hormone."
https://openalex.org/W2032910685,"We have previously described the induction of two sets of sporulation-specific mRNAs in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Herein we correlate the appearance of these RNAs with the major morphogenic events of sporulation, and we analyze the spatial distribution of the RNAs within the ascus. Several observations suggest that the first set of messages is involved in spore wall synthesis. In fractionation experiments, these mRNAs are detected in the ascal cytoplasm but not in developing spores, indicating that the proteinaceous component of the spore wall is synthesized from the external compartment. The second set of messages is induced later in the course of spore maturation. These mRNAs accumulate within the spores and, unlike the first set of mRNAs, are retained in mature asci until the early stages of germination. We conclude that the development of ascospores proceeds through the differentiation of functionally distinct subcellular compartments."
https://openalex.org/W1517532336,"The contents of mucocysts of the ciliated protozoan Tetrahymena thermophila comprise about 12 proteins, ranging in relative mobility (Mr) from approximately 160,000 to 8,000. There are at least four families of sulfhydryl-linked mucocyst polypeptides. One of these families includes a prominent Mr 34,000 protein, as determined by one- and two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. The Mr 34,000 protein is resolved into two species in isoelectric focusing gels, with apparent pI values of 4.8 and 4.9; most of the other mucocyst proteins also exhibit acidic apparent isoelectric points. The identity of the major Mr 34,000 protein as a bona fide mucocyst component is substantiated by indirect immunofluorescent localization of this protein in a linear punctate pattern coincident with the localization of mucocysts in these cells; this pattern of localization can be abolished by stimulation of synchronous secretion and is absent in a mutant strain devoid of these secretory organelles (Maihle, N. J., and Satir, B. H. (1985a) J. Cell Sci. 78, 49-65."
https://openalex.org/W1549521446,"Abstract Two novel C10-(dipeptidyl)cephalosporin esters (3-(beta-chloro-L-alanyl-beta-chloro-L-alanyloxymethyl)-7 beta-(2-thienylacetamido)-3-cephem-4-carboxylic acid (7) and sodium 3-(L-alanyl-L-alanyloxymethyl)-7 beta-(2-thienylacetamido)-3-cephem-4-carboxylate, toluene-sulfonic acid salt (18] were synthesized, and their reactions with Escherichia coli TEM beta-lactamase were examined. Kinetic parameters determined for the enzymatic reactions of 7 (Km = 0.32 mM; Vmax = 338 mumol min-1 (mg protein)-1) and of 18 (Km = 0.33 mM, Vmax = 338 mumol min-1 (mg protein)-1) demonstrate that both of the peptidyl esters are good substrates for the lactamase. In fact, the Vmax rates for 7 and 18 are each more than 4-fold greater than that obtained for cephalothin, 1 (Vmax = 78 mumol min-1 (mg protein)-1), a well characterized substrate for the lactamases. Analysis of the enzymatic reactions by high field (500 MHz) 1H NMR revealed similar patterns for fragmentation of the cephem nucleus of 1, 7, and 18. However, while hydrolysis of 1 produces acetate, cleavage of 7 and 18 releases beta Cl-LAla-beta Cl-LAla and LAla-LAla, respectively, from the dipeptidyl cephalosporin esters. Based on these findings, a strategy for co-opting the beta-lactamases of Gram-negative bacteria for delivery of bactericidal agents is described, and an explanation for the previously reported (Mobashery, S., Lerner, S.A., and Johnston, M. (1986) J. Am. Chem. Soc. 108, 1685) antibacterial activity of 7 is offered."
https://openalex.org/W1596580938,"Upon incubation with rat liver membranes, radioiodinated rat intermediate density lipoproteins (IDL) interacted with at least two binding sites having a low and a high affinity as demonstrated by the curvilinear Scatchard plots obtained from the specific binding data. The purpose of our work was to identify the nature of these binding sites. Human low density lipoproteins (LDL), contain apolipoprotein B only, and human high density lipoproteins (HDL3), containing neither apolipoprotein B nor E, were both capable of decreasing the specific binding of rat 125I-IDL. The Scatchard analysis clearly revealed that only the low affinity component was affected by the addition of these human lipoproteins. In fact, the low affinity binding component gradually decreased as the amount of human LDL or HDL3 increased in the binding assay. At a 200-fold excess of human LDL or HDL3, the low affinity binding was totally masked, and the Scatchard plot of the specific 125I-IDL binding became linear. Only the high affinity binding component was left, enabling a precise measurement of its binding parameters. In a series of competitive displacement experiments in which the binding assay contained a 200-fold excess of human LDL or HDL3, only unlabeled rat IDL effectively displaced the binding of rat 125I-IDL. We conclude that the low affinity binding of rat IDL to rat liver membranes is due to weak interactions with unspecified lipoprotein binding sites. The camouflage of these sites by human lipoproteins makes possible the study of IDL binding to the high affinity component which likely represents the combined effect of IDL binding to both the remnant and the LDL receptors."
https://openalex.org/W1605604337,"Exposure of Escherichia coli to heat resulted in 1) selective inhibition of protein synthesis, 2) synthesis of heat shock proteins, and 3) altered subcellular distribution of newly synthesized proteins. Either 5 min or 1 h at 48 degrees C increases outer membrane proteins of Coomassie Blue-stained gels. After 1 h, there was a loss of stained proteins from the soluble fraction. Much greater changes in the distribution of radiolabeled (newly synthesized) proteins were observed, with marked increases in the number of outer membrane protein species and a corresponding loss of soluble fraction proteins. Three major species of radiolabeled proteins from heat-treated cells remain in the soluble fraction; these proteins have apparent Mr 56,000, 69,200, and 79,400. Cells were labeled with L-[35S] methionine at either 37 or 48 degrees C and chased with non-radiolabeled methionine before a temperature shift to either 48 or 37 degrees C, respectively. Only proteins synthesized at elevated temperature participated in translocation. It is suggested that heat disordering of membrane lipids promotes interlipidic connections between the inner and outer membrane providing pathways for protein movement to the outer membrane and may be the mechanism whereby a cell quickly responds to environmental temperature stress. The response does not require but may trigger synthesis of mRNA."

https://openalex.org/W1494094208,"Equilibria and rates were observed over the ranges 1-1600 atm, 3-10 mM Mg2+, at 60 mM NH4Cl, pH 7.5, 20 degrees C, by light scattering. The main reaction is accurately represented at all conditions by the following phenomenological equations. 30 S + 50 S = 70 S, KA70 = ka/kd = [70 S]/[30 S][50 S] The equilibrium constants obey simple rules: the volume of association, delta VA0, has the constant value 242 +/- 9 ml/mol, independent of pressure, at all Mg2+ concentrations; the derived values of log KA70 at 1 atm increase linearly with log [Mg2+] at a slope of 7.5. In contrast, the rate constants show a clear break at 6 mM Mg2+: below 6 mM, log ka decreases with pressure with a delta Va of 105 +/- 9 ml/mol and increases with log [Mg2+] at a slope of 4.9; above 6 mM, these values are halved; a split can actually be seen at 6 mM Mg2+, near 500 atm. The usual two-step mechanism for second order reactions in solution, which would insert a 70 S' species, either an encounter complex or a true low concentration steady state intermediate, into the above equation can accommodate these results: as [Mg2+] increases, the rate of transformation of 70 S' into 70 S finally predominates over the rate of dissociation of 70 S' into subunits. The bulk of the pressure effects and all of the [Mg2+] dependence arise from the progressive increase in delta GA0 (electrostatic) that occurs when 30, 50, and 70 S particles all lose equivalent fractions of their internal Mg2+ in response to increases in pressure or decreases in [Mg2+]."
https://openalex.org/W1870532459,"It has been proposed that regulatory multienzyme complex formation between yeast ornithine transcarbamoylase (OTCase) and arginase is triggered by a conformational change promoted by the binding of ornithine to a regulatory site in OTCase (Wiame, J.-M. (1971) Curr. Top. Cell. Regul. 4, 1-38). To isolate the binding of ornithine to the proposed regulatory site, the active site was blocked with the high affinity (Ki = 13 +/- 1.4 nM) bisubstrate analogue, delta-N-phosphonacetyl-L-ornithine (PALO). The binding of PALO to the active site produces large changes in the absorption (delta A290-296 = 0.010/mg of enzyme) and in the fluorescence (25% quenching) of the protein. These changes both saturate at one PALO/polypeptide chain. The binding of PALO also changes the rate constant for diffusional acrylamide quenching by 43% and increases the midpoint for the thermal denaturation of the enzyme by 13 degrees C. Finally, PALO binding results in a +2.8% change in the sedimentation coefficient demonstrating that these spectral and energetic changes are associated with a gross structural change in the enzyme. In an effort to detect ligand binding to the proposed effector site on OTCase, ornithine was added to the enzyme saturated with PALO, and consequent conformational changes were tested for using methodologies identical to those which demonstrated active site ligand binding-promoted conformational changes. In no instance were any additional differences observed. Hence, strong support for isosteric effector binding-promoted conformational changes cannot be presented. We conclude that active site ligand binding events themselves are responsible for conformational changes which promote enzyme-enzyme association of OTCase with arginase."
https://openalex.org/W1598457475,"The dipeptide beta Cl-LAla-beta Cl-LAla is an antibacterial agent designed to utilize bacterial peptide transport for intracellular delivery of the alanine racemase inactivator beta Cl-LAla. The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) for the peptide against Gram-negative species grown on enriched agar medium range from 1.56 to 12.5 micrograms/ml; MICs are increased to greater than 100 micrograms/ml when D-alanine is included in the medium, indicating that alanine racemase is, in fact, inhibited in sensitive species. When susceptible Gram-negative cells are grown on a minimal medium, D-alanine supplementation alone does not increase the MICs for beta Cl-LAla-beta Cl-LAla, but complete protection is afforded by supplementation with D-alanine, L-valine, L-leucine, and L-isoleucine. In liquid culture, the peptide is: bactericidal and lytic against Escherichia coli JSR-O growing in enriched medium or in minimal medium supplemented with the branched-chain amino acids; only inhibitory against these cells growing in minimal medium supplemented with D-alanine; and ineffective against these cells in minimal medium containing the branched-chain amino acids plus D-alanine. Cells exposed to beta Cl-LAla-beta Cl-LAla (with the protection of the four amino acids) have specific activities of both alanine racemase and transaminase B that are lower than those of cultures not treated with the peptide. Finally, E. coli JSR-O alanine racemase experiences time-dependent loss of activity when exposed to the dipeptide in the presence of aminopeptidases; the dipeptide alone is not an inactivator of the racemase in vitro. These results suggest the following mechanism of action for beta Cl-LAla-beta Cl-LAla: transport of the dipeptide into the cell; intracellular hydrolysis to give accumulation of beta Cl-LAla; and subsequent inactivation of targeted enzymes. Whether inactivation of the racemase or of the transaminase determines the pathophysiologic effects of the peptide depends on the composition of the growth medium."
https://openalex.org/W1584807630,"The fluorescent reagent N-(iodoacetylaminoethyl)-5-naphthylamine-1-sulfonic acid (I-AEDANS) was employed to detect and study the previously reported conformational change in the Escherichia coli ribosome induced by streptomycin. Labeling of ribosomes with this probe, which results in the derivatization of proteins S18 and L31', described earlier, inhibits neither their ribosomal protein synthesizing nor misreading ability. To calculate the amount of streptomycin bound to the ribosome, we determined the K'D for streptomycin, which is 0.24 micron, indicating that under our conditions, bound streptomycin/ribosome molar ratios are low, not in excess of 1. Under these conditions, streptomycin addition induces fluorescence quenching by 15% but does not affect streptomycin-resistant ribosomes. Maximal misreading occurs at these same ratios. Removal of AEDANS-L31' from the ribosomes drastically reduces streptomycin-induced quenching indicating the involvement of the environment of this protein in streptomycin action. The finding that streptomycin decreases AEDANS-L31' affinity for the ribosome supports this view. Streptomycin has been shown to bind to the 30 S subunit protein S4 while the 50 S protein L31' has been shown to be localized at the subunit interface. Thus, the observation that streptomycin influences this 50 S subunit protein L31', combined with the tight correlation between the effects of streptomycin on quenching and on misreading, strongly suggests that this antibiotic induces a conformational change at the subunit interface of the ribosome, and that this results in misreading. Polyuridylic acid also induces a conformational change in the ribosome but the polynucleotide and streptomycin seem to act independently. Streptomycin-resistant ribosomes, which undergo neither streptomycin-induced fluorescence nor streptomycin-induced misreading, are resistant to misreading induced by high Mg2+ as well."
