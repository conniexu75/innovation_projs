https://openalex.org/W1983086029,"While current major national research efforts (i.e., the NIH Human Microbiome Project) will enable comprehensive metagenomic characterization of the adult human microbiota, how and when these diverse microbial communities take up residence in the host and during reproductive life are unexplored at a population level. Because microbial abundance and diversity might differ in pregnancy, we sought to generate comparative metagenomic signatures across gestational age strata. DNA was isolated from the vagina (introitus, posterior fornix, midvagina) and the V5V3 region of bacterial 16S rRNA genes were sequenced (454FLX Titanium platform). Sixty-eight samples from 24 healthy gravidae (18 to 40 confirmed weeks) were compared with 301 non-pregnant controls (60 subjects). Generated sequence data were quality filtered, taxonomically binned, normalized, and organized by phylogeny and into operational taxonomic units (OTU); principal coordinates analysis (PCoA) of the resultant beta diversity measures were used for visualization and analysis in association with sample clinical metadata. Altogether, 1.4 gigabytes of data containing >2.5 million reads (averaging 6,837 sequences/sample of 493 nt in length) were generated for computational analyses. Although gravidae were not excluded by virtue of a posterior fornix pH >4.5 at the time of screening, unique vaginal microbiome signature encompassing several specific OTUs and higher-level clades was nevertheless observed and confirmed using a combination of phylogenetic, non-phylogenetic, supervised, and unsupervised approaches. Both overall diversity and richness were reduced in pregnancy, with dominance of Lactobacillus species (L. iners crispatus, jensenii and johnsonii, and the orders Lactobacillales (and Lactobacillaceae family), Clostridiales, Bacteroidales, and Actinomycetales. This intergroup comparison using rigorous standardized sampling protocols and analytical methodologies provides robust initial evidence that the vaginal microbial 16S rRNA gene catalogue uniquely differs in pregnancy, with variance of taxa across vaginal subsite and gestational age."

The body sites with the greatest number of core OTUs, defined as OTUs shared amongst 95% or more of the individuals, were the oral sites (saliva, tongue, cheek, gums, and throat) followed by the nose, stool, and skin, while the vaginal sites had the fewest number of OTUs shared across subjects. We found that commonalities between samples based on taxonomy could sometimes belie variability at the sub-genus OTU level. This was particularly apparent in the mouth where a given genus can be present in many different oral sites, but the sub-genus OTUs show very distinct site selection, and in the vaginal sites, which are consistently dominated by the Lactobacillus genus but have distinctly different sub-genus V1-V3 OTU populations across subjects. Different body sites show approximately a ten-fold difference in estimated microbial richness, with stool samples having the highest estimated richness, followed by the mouth, throat and gums, then by the skin, nasal and vaginal sites. Richness as measured by the V1-V3 primers was consistently higher than richness measured by V3-V5. We also show that when such a large cohort is analyzed at the genus level, most subjects fit the stool ""enterotype"" profile, but other subjects are intermediate, blurring the distinction between the enterotypes. When analyzed at the finer-scale, OTU level, there was little or no segregation into stool enterotypes, but in the vagina distinct biotypes were apparent. Finally, we note that even OTUs present in nearly every subject, or that dominate in some samples, showed orders of magnitude variation in relative abundance emphasizing the highly variable nature across individuals."
https://openalex.org/W2060637207,"The various ecological habitats in the human body provide microbes a wide array of nutrient sources and survival challenges. Advances in technology such as DNA sequencing have allowed a deeper perspective into the molecular function of the human microbiota than has been achievable in the past. Here we aimed to examine the enzymes that cleave complex carbohydrates (CAZymes) in the human microbiome in order to determine (i) whether the CAZyme profiles of bacterial genomes are more similar within body sites or bacterial families and (ii) the sugar degradation and utilization capabilities of microbial communities inhabiting various human habitats. Upon examination of 493 bacterial references genomes from 12 human habitats, we found that sugar degradation capabilities of taxa are more similar to others in the same bacterial family than to those inhabiting the same habitat. Yet, the analysis of 520 metagenomic samples from five major body sites show that even when the community composition varies the CAZyme profiles are very similar within a body site, suggesting that the observed functional profile and microbial habitation have adapted to the local carbohydrate composition. When broad sugar utilization was compared within the five major body sites, the gastrointestinal track contained the highest potential for total sugar degradation, while dextran and peptidoglycan degradation were highest in oral and vaginal sites respectively. Our analysis suggests that the carbohydrate composition of each body site has a profound influence and probably constitutes one of the major driving forces that shapes the community composition and therefore the CAZyme profile of the local microbial communities, which in turn reflects the microbiome fitness to a body site."
https://openalex.org/W1985508382,"MYB proteins comprise a large family of plant transcription factors, members of which perform a variety of functions in plant biological processes. To date, no genome-wide characterization of this gene family has been conducted in maize (Zea mays). In the present study, we performed a comprehensive computational analysis, to yield a complete overview of the R2R3-MYB gene family in maize, including the phylogeny, expression patterns, and also its structural and functional characteristics. The MYB gene structure in maize and Arabidopsis were highly conserved, indicating that they were originally compact in size. Subgroup-specific conserved motifs outside the MYB domain may reflect functional conservation. The genome distribution strongly supports the hypothesis that segmental and tandem duplication contribute to the expansion of maize MYB genes. We also performed an updated and comprehensive classification of the R2R3-MYB gene families in maize and other plant species. The result revealed that the functions were conserved between maize MYB genes and their putative orthologs, demonstrating the origin and evolutionary diversification of plant MYB genes. Species-specific groups/subgroups may evolve or be lost during evolution, resulting in functional divergence. Expression profile study indicated that maize R2R3-MYB genes exhibit a variety of expression patterns, suggesting diverse functions. Furthermore, computational prediction potential targets of maize microRNAs (miRNAs) revealed that miR159, miR319, and miR160 may be implicated in regulating maize R2R3-MYB genes, suggesting roles of these miRNAs in post-transcriptional regulation and transcription networks. Our comparative analysis of R2R3-MYB genes in maize confirm and extend the sequence and functional characteristics of this gene family, and will facilitate future functional analysis of the MYB gene family in maize."
https://openalex.org/W2120529603,"We tested the hypothesis that Crohn’s disease (CD)-related genetic polymorphisms involved in host innate immunity are associated with shifts in human ileum–associated microbial composition in a cross-sectional analysis of human ileal samples. Sanger sequencing of the bacterial 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene and 454 sequencing of 16S rRNA gene hypervariable regions (V1–V3 and V3–V5), were conducted on macroscopically disease-unaffected ileal biopsies collected from 52 ileal CD, 58 ulcerative colitis and 60 control patients without inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) undergoing initial surgical resection. These subjects also were genotyped for the three major NOD2 risk alleles (Leu1007fs, R708W, G908R) and the ATG16L1 risk allele (T300A). The samples were linked to clinical metadata, including body mass index, smoking status and Clostridia difficile infection. The sequences were classified into seven phyla/subphyla categories using the Naïve Bayesian Classifier of the Ribosome Database Project. Centered log ratio transformation of six predominant categories was included as the dependent variable in the permutation based MANCOVA for the overall composition with stepwise variable selection. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays were conducted to measure the relative frequencies of the Clostridium coccoides – Eubacterium rectales group and the Faecalibacterium prausnitzii spp. Empiric logit transformations of the relative frequencies of these two microbial groups were included in permutation-based ANCOVA. Regardless of sequencing method, IBD phenotype, Clostridia difficile and NOD2 genotype were selected as associated (FDR ≤0.05) with shifts in overall microbial composition. IBD phenotype and NOD2 genotype were also selected as associated with shifts in the relative frequency of the C. coccoides – E. rectales group. IBD phenotype, smoking and IBD medications were selected as associated with shifts in the relative frequency of F. prausnitzii spp. These results indicate that the effects of genetic and environmental factors on IBD are mediated at least in part by the enteric microbiota."
https://openalex.org/W2063053479,"Analysis of human body microbial diversity is fundamental to understanding community structure, biology and ecology. The National Institutes of Health Human Microbiome Project (HMP) has provided an unprecedented opportunity to examine microbial diversity within and across body habitats and individuals through pyrosequencing-based profiling of 16 S rRNA gene sequences (16 S) from habits of the oral, skin, distal gut, and vaginal body regions from over 200 healthy individuals enabling the application of statistical techniques. In this study, two approaches were applied to elucidate the nature and extent of human microbiome diversity. First, bootstrap and parametric curve fitting techniques were evaluated to estimate the maximum number of unique taxa, S(max), and taxa discovery rate for habitats across individuals. Next, our results demonstrated that the variation of diversity within low abundant taxa across habitats and individuals was not sufficiently quantified with standard ecological diversity indices. This impact from low abundant taxa motivated us to introduce a novel rank-based diversity measure, the Tail statistic, (""τ""), based on the standard deviation of the rank abundance curve if made symmetric by reflection around the most abundant taxon. Due to τ's greater sensitivity to low abundant taxa, its application to diversity estimation of taxonomic units using taxonomic dependent and independent methods revealed a greater range of values recovered between individuals versus body habitats, and different patterns of diversity within habitats. The greatest range of τ values within and across individuals was found in stool, which also exhibited the most undiscovered taxa. Oral and skin habitats revealed variable diversity patterns, while vaginal habitats were consistently the least diverse. Collectively, these results demonstrate the importance, and motivate the introduction, of several visualization and analysis methods tuned specifically for next-generation sequence data, further revealing that low abundant taxa serve as an important reservoir of genetic diversity in the human microbiome."
https://openalex.org/W2130734615,"Unexplained fever (UF) is a common problem in children under 3 years old. Although virus infection is suspected to be the cause of most of these fevers, a comprehensive analysis of viruses in samples from children with fever and healthy controls is important for establishing a relationship between viruses and UF. We used unbiased, deep sequencing to analyze 176 nasopharyngeal swabs (NP) and plasma samples from children with UF and afebrile controls, generating an average of 4.6 million sequences per sample. An analysis pipeline was developed to detect viral sequences, which resulted in the identification of sequences from 25 viral genera. These genera included expected pathogens, such as adenoviruses, enteroviruses, and roseoloviruses, plus viruses with unknown pathogenicity. Viruses that were unexpected in NP and plasma samples, such as the astrovirus MLB-2, were also detected. Sequencing allowed identification of virus subtype for some viruses, including roseoloviruses. Highly sensitive PCR assays detected low levels of viruses that were not detected in approximately 5 million sequences, but greater sequencing depth improved sensitivity. On average NP and plasma samples from febrile children contained 1.5- to 5-fold more viral sequences, respectively, than samples from afebrile children. Samples from febrile children contained a broader range of viral genera and contained multiple viral genera more frequently than samples from children without fever. Differences between febrile and afebrile groups were most striking in the plasma samples, where detection of viral sequence may be associated with a disseminated infection. These data indicate that virus infection is associated with UF. Further studies are important in order to establish the range of viral pathogens associated with fever and to understand of the role of viral infection in fever. Ultimately these studies may improve the medical treatment of children with UF by helping avoid antibiotic therapy for children with viral infections."
https://openalex.org/W1973980288,"N-terminal acetylation is a very common post-translational modification, although its role in regulating protein physical properties and function remains poorly understood. α-Synuclein (α-syn), a protein that has been linked to the pathogenesis of Parkinson disease, is constitutively Nα-acetylated in vivo. Nevertheless, most of the biochemical and biophysical studies on the structure, aggregation, and function of α-syn in vitro utilize recombinant α-syn from Escherichia coli, which is not N-terminally acetylated. To elucidate the effect of Nα-acetylation on the biophysical and biological properties of α-syn, we produced Nα-acetylated α-syn first using a semisynthetic methodology based on expressed protein ligation (Berrade, L., and Camarero, J. A. (2009) Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 66, 3909–3922) and then a recombinant expression strategy, to compare its properties to unacetylated α-syn. We demonstrate that both WT and Nα-acetylated α-syn share a similar secondary structure and oligomeric state using both purified protein preparations and in-cell NMR on E. coli overexpressing Nα-acetylated α-syn. The two proteins have very close aggregation propensities as shown by thioflavin T binding and sedimentation assays. Furthermore, both Nα-acetylated and WT α-syn exhibited similar ability to bind synaptosomal membranes in vitro and in HeLa cells, where both internalized proteins exhibited prominent cytosolic subcellular distribution. We then determined the effect of attenuating Nα-acetylation in living cells, first by using a nonacetylable mutant and then by silencing the enzyme responsible for α-syn Nα-acetylation. Both approaches revealed similar subcellular distribution and membrane binding for both the nonacetylable mutant and WT α-syn, suggesting that N-terminal acetylation does not significantly affect its structure in vitro and in intact cells.

In the case of α-syn, although the enzyme responsible for its Nα-acetylation has not yet been identified, the substrate specificity of NatB (which catalyzes Nα-acetylation of proteins retaining an initiator methionine followed by either Asp or Glu) suggests that it could be the enzyme mediating α-syn acetylation in human cells. As such, preliminary attempts to assess the effect of Nα-acetylation on α-syn behavior involved knocking down members of the NatB complex in yeast cells (29.Zabrocki P. Bastiaens I. Delay C. Bammens T. Ghillebert R. Pellens K. De Virgilio C. Van Leuven F. Winderickx J. Phosphorylation, lipid raft interaction, and traffic of α-synuclein in a yeast model for Parkinson.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2008; 1783: 1767-1780Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Consistent with previous reports implicating Nα-acetylation with regulation of membrane targeting of some proteins (30.Arnesen T. Toward a functional understanding of protein N-terminal acetylation.PLoS Biol. 2011; 9: e1001074Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar), NatB silencing lead to the re-localization of an α-syn-GFP fusion construct from the plasma membrane to the cytosol. However, because that study did not assess the effect of NatB knockdown on α-syn Nα-acetylation, it remains unclear whether this effect was due to the specific loss of α-syn Nα-acetylation or due to the alteration of some other NatB-controlled pathway. Despite the identification of quantitative Nα-acetylation of α-syn both as soluble protein and entrapped within Lewy bodies from human PD brains (11.Anderson J.P. Walker D.E.

However, even though prokaryotes do acetylate some of their proteins, this occurs via a distinct pathway that is not homologous to that mediated by yeast and human N-acetyltransferases (31.Soppa J. Protein acetylation in archaea, bacteria, and eukaryotes.Archaea. 2010; (2010)Crossref Scopus (99) Google Scholar); hence, recombinant α-syn purified from E. coli is not Nα-acetylated. We therefore sought to determine the effect of α-syn Nα-acetylation on its conformation, membrane interactions, aggregation properties, and finally subcellular localization in mammalian cells. When we began this study, the lack of knowledge of a specific N-terminal acetyltransferase acting on α-syn, and the lack of chemical methods to specifically acetylate the N terminus of recombinant proteins, led us to rely on a protein semisynthesis approach based on expressed protein ligation (EPL) (1.Berrade L. Camarero J.A. Expressed protein ligation. A resourceful tool to study protein structure and function.Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2009; 66: 3909-3922Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), which has been recently applied by our group to prepare N-terminal monoubiquitylated and C-terminal phosphorylated forms of α-syn (32.Hejjaoui M. Haj-Yahya M. Kumar K.S. Brik A. Lashuel H.A. Toward elucidation of the role of ubiquitination in the pathogenesis of Parkinson disease with semisynthetic ubiquitinated α-synuclein.Angew. Chem. Int.

Soc. 2012; 134: 5196-5210Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Later, we applied a recombinant expression strategy based on co-expression of α-syn and NatB, which generated quantitatively acetylated α-syn based on mass spectroscopic analysis. We then utilized these approaches to generate Nα-acetylated α-syn in milligram quantities, and we determined the effect of Nα-acetylation on the structure, oligomerization, and aggregation of α-syn in vitro and in intact Escherichia coli using a battery of biophysical methods, including NMR, static light scattering, and sedimentation and thioflavin T fluorescence assays. Together, our studies revealed that WT and Nα-acetylated α-syn exist predominantly as disordered proteins. NMR data in intact cells also ruled out the presence of stable or highly populated α-syn oligomers and confirmed the intrinsically disordered nature of the protein in E. coli regardless of its Nα-acetylation state or purification method. We also show that Nα-acetylation does not significantly influence α-syn fibrillization, membrane binding, or its subcellular localization in mammalian cells. These results and their implications for α-syn structure and function in health and disease are presented and discussed. N-Methylpyrrolidone (extra-pure) was bought from Acros Organics (Geel, Belgium). The following were purchased from Sigma: ammonium iodide; benzyl mercaptan; t-butyl-mercaptan; 4-mercaptophenylacetic acid; 1,2-ethanedithiol; methyl 2-mercaptopropionate; 4-nitrophenylchloroformate; O-methylhydroxylamine hydrochloride; thioanisole; dimethyl sulfide; dichloromethane; N,N-diisopropylethylamine, N,N-dimethylformamide, tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine (TCEP); trifluoroacetic acid (TFA); thioflavin T (ThT), and triisopropylsilane. Guanidinium hydrochloride (GdnHCl) was from MP Biomedicals (Solon, OH). Fmoc-protected amino acids, di-Fmoc-3,4-diaminobenzoic acid, Fmoc-Rink-amide methylbenzhydrylamine resins (initial substitution 0.4 mmol/g), and O-benzotriazole-N,N,N′,N′-tetramethyluronium-hexafluorophosphate were from Anaspec (Fremont, CA). N-Acetylmethionine was purchased from Bachem (Bubendorf, Switzerland). Piperidine was bought from Merck. The water-soluble radical initiator 2,2′-azobis[2-(2-imidazolin-2-yl)propane]dihydrochloride (VA-044) was purchased from Wako Pure Chemical Industries Ltd. (Osaka, Japan). Acetonitrile (HPLC gradient-grade) was obtained from VWR (West Chester, PA). Phenol crystals were from Carlo Erba reagents (Val de Reuil, France). Buffer solutions were from AppliChem (Darmstadt, Germany). The Ac-α-syn(1–10)-SR (R = CH2CH2SO3H) peptide was synthesized using Fmoc chemistry on a CS336X automated peptide synthesizer (CSBio, Menlo Park, CA), employing the in situ neutralization protocol. The peptide was assembled on a di-Fmoc-3,4-diaminobenzoic acid-loaded Rink-amide methylbenzhydrylamine resin to obtain a peptide thioester according to the method described by Blanco-Canosa and Dawson (34.Blanco-Canosa J.B. Dawson P.E. An efficient Fmoc-SPPS approach for the generation of thioester peptide precursors for use in native chemical ligation.Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. 2008; 47: 6851-6855Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar). After a first manual deprotection with 50% piperidine in N-methylpyrrolidone (two times for 10 min), the first residue was double-coupled manually (45-min coupling time each) before transferring the resin to the automated synthesizer. During automated synthesis, Fmoc groups were deprotected with 20% piperidine/N-methylpyrrolidone for 3 min and then repeated for 7 min. Amino acid coupling cycles were carried out with 5 eq of Fmoc-amino acids, 5 eq of O-benzotriazole-N,N,N′,N′-tetramethyluronium-hexafluorophosphate/HOBt, and 10 eq of N,N-diisopropylethylamine for 30 min. The N-terminal residue was coupled as N-acetylmethionine (Bachem), because on-resin acetylation with acetic anhydride would have also blocked the second amine functionality of the C-terminal diaminobenzoic acid linker, which must remain free to perform on-resin C-terminal activation (34.Blanco-Canosa J.B. Dawson P.E. An efficient Fmoc-SPPS approach for the generation of thioester peptide precursors for use in native chemical ligation.Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. 2008; 47: 6851-6855Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar). On-resin activation to obtain a C-terminal N-acyl-benzimidazolinone (Nbz) group was done by treatment with 5 eq of 4-nitrophenylchloroformate (10 mg/ml, 40 min, RT) in dry CH2Cl2, followed by 0.5 m N,N-diisopropylethylamine in N,N-dimethylformamide (15 min, RT). This procedure was repeated three times (three times with 15 ml of N,N-dimethylformamide and three times with 15 ml of dry CH2Cl2 wash cycles in between) to ensure quantitative conversion to the N-acyl-benzimidazolinone group. The peptide was finally cleaved from the resin and deprotected using 10 ml of Reagent H (35.Huang H. Rabenstein D.L. A cleavage cocktail for methionine-containing peptides.J. Pept. Res. 1999; 53: 548-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) to prevent methionine oxidation. Deprotection was done for 3–4 h at RT, followed by three consecutive precipitations in 10-fold excess of cold diethyl ether. Peptide precipitates were then lyophilized. Crude peptides were first treated with 0.45 m sodium mercaptoethanesulfonate at 37 °C for 30 min, before purification by reversed-phase HPLC (Waters 600 system) on a preparative C18 column (Cosmosil Protein-R, 20 × 250 mm, 5-μm particle size, and 300-Å pore size, at 10 ml/min using a linear gradient of solvent B in solvent A, from 25% B to 45% B over 40 min, where solvent A was 0.1% TFA in water and solvent B was 0.1% TFA in acetonitrile). Fractions were pooled according to purity as assessed by ESI-MS analysis (LTQ ion trap, Thermo Scientific), and final purity assessment was made by re-injection of pooled fractions on an analytical C18Cosmosil Protein-R column (4.6 × 250 mm, 5-μm particle size, and 300-Å pore size) connected to a Waters Alliance 27. Pure pooled fractions were evaporated to remove organic solvents, lyophilized, and stored at −20 °C under inert atmosphere. Expression of recombinant α-syn Δ2–10 A11C (referred to as α-syn(A11C-140)) as performed as described previously (32.Hejjaoui M. Haj-Yahya M. Kumar K.S. Brik A. Lashuel H.A.

Engl. 2011; 50: 405-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Briefly, BL21(DE3) cells transformed with a pT7-7 plasmid carrying the insert of interest were grown at 37 °C in LB medium induced with 1 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside at A600 = 0.6–0.7 and then incubated for 4 h. Cells were then harvested and lysed by sonication. The protein was then purified by anion-exchange followed by gel-filtration chromatography; dialyzed against water, and lyophilized. Because the N-terminal cysteine reacts with various endogenous aldehydes and ketones in E. coli, resulting in cyclic adducts that would not react during native chemical ligation (NCL), the lyophilized material was treated with 100 mm O-methylhydroxylamine and 30 eq of TCEP in 6 m GdnHCl at pH 4.0 for 1–2 h at 37 °C. The protein was then separated from the reagents and by-products by reversed-phase HPLC, lyophilized, and stored at −20 °C under inert atmosphere until use. For large scale ligations, α-syn(A11C-140) was dissolved in 1 ml of 6 m GdnHCl, 0.2 m sodium phosphate to a final concentration of 0.83 mm. 30 eq of TCEP were added to prevent disulfide formation. 1.2 eq of Ac-α-syn(1–10)SR were added, followed by 10 eq of 4-mercaptophenylacetic acid (with respect to the peptide fragment) as the NCL catalyst (36.Johnson E.C. Kent S.B. Insights into the mechanism and catalysis of the native chemical ligation reaction.J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2006; 128: 6640-6646Crossref PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar). The pH was then adjusted to 7.0 with aqueous NaOH, and the reaction was incubated at 37 °C under inert atmosphere for up to 4 h. Because 4-mercaptophenylacetic acid has been found to interfere with the radical-based desulfurization procedure, it was first removed by desalting the NCL reaction mixture using HiTrap desalting 5 ml (GE Healthcare) equilibrated with 200 mm of the volatile buffer ammonium bicarbonate. After lyophilization, the powder was redissolved in 800 μl of 6 m GdnHCl, 0.2 m sodium phosphate, pH 7.0. To this solution, 800 μl of 1.0 m TCEP in 6 m GdnHCl, pH 7.0, t-butyl mercaptan was added to a final concentration of 840 mm, and VA-044 to a final concentration of 5.4 mm. The reaction was complete within 3 h of incubation at 37 °C under argon. The ligation product was purified by reversed-phase HPLC on a semipreparative InertSil C8 column (7.6 × 250 mm; 5-μm particle size and 300-Å pore size, at 5 ml/min using a gradient from 25% B to 50% B over 30 min), evaporated, and lyophilized.

As such, ALK1 is an important therapeutic target. Thus, several ALK1-directed agents are currently in clinical trials as anti-angiogenic cancer therapeutics. Given the biological and clinical importance of the ALK1 signaling pathway, we sought to elucidate the biophysical and structural basis underlying ALK1 signaling. The TGF-β family ligands BMP9 and BMP10 as well as the three type II TGF-β family receptors ActRIIA, ActRIIB, and BMPRII have been implicated in ALK1 signaling. Here, we provide a kinetic and thermodynamic analysis of BMP9 and BMP10 interactions with ALK1 and type II receptors. Our data show that BMP9 displays a significant discrimination in type II receptor binding, whereas BMP10 does not. We also report the crystal structure of a fully assembled ternary complex of BMP9 with the extracellular domains of ALK1 and ActRIIB. The structure reveals that the high specificity of ALK1 for BMP9/10 is determined by a novel orientation of ALK1 with respect to BMP9, which leads to a unique set of receptor-ligand interactions. In addition, the structure explains how BMP9 discriminates between low and high affinity type II receptors. Taken together, our findings provide structural and mechanistic insights into ALK1 signaling that could serve as a basis for novel anti-angiogenic therapies."
https://openalex.org/W2027433665,"ALS, or amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, is a progressive and fatal motor neuron disease with no effective medicine. Importantly, the majority of the ALS cases are with TDP-43 proteinopathies characterized with TDP-43-positive, ubiquitin-positive inclusions (UBIs) in the cytosol. However, the role of the mismetabolism of TDP-43 in the pathogenesis of ALS with TDP-43 proteinopathies is unclear. Using the conditional mouse gene targeting approach, we show that mice with inactivation of the Tardbp gene in the spinal cord motor neurons (HB9:Cre-Tardbp(lx/-)) exhibit progressive and male-dominant development of ALS-related phenotypes including kyphosis, motor dysfunctions, muscle weakness/atrophy, motor neuron loss, and astrocytosis in the spinal cord. Significantly, ubiquitinated proteins accumulate in the TDP-43-depleted motor neurons of the spinal cords of HB9:Cre-Tardbp(lx/-) mice with the ALS phenotypes. This study not only establishes an important role of TDP-43 in the long term survival and functioning of the mammalian spinal cord motor neurons, but also establishes that loss of TDP-43 function could be one major cause for neurodegeneration in ALS with TDP-43 proteinopathies."

Human serum albumin (HSA) binds 95% of Aβ in blood plasma and is thought to inhibit plaque formation in peripheral tissue. However, the role of albumin in binding Aβ in the cerebrospinal fluid has been largely overlooked. Here we investigate the effect of HSA on both Aβ(1-40) and Aβ(1-42) fibril growth. We show that at micromolar cerebrospinal fluid levels, HSA inhibits the kinetics of Aβ fibrillization, significantly increasing the lag time and decreasing the total amount of fibrils produced. Furthermore, we show that the amount of amyloid fibers generated directly correlates to the proportion of Aβ not competitively bound to albumin. Our observations suggest a significant role for HSA regulating Aβ fibril growth in the brain interstitium."

This prospective study evaluates the use of buprenorphine/naloxone (BPN/NLX) as a method to reduce relapse to opioid use and sustain viral suppression among released HIV-infected prisoners meeting criteria for opioid dependence (OD). Methods From 2005–2010, 94 subjects meeting DSM-IV criteria for OD were recruited from a 24-week prospective trial of directly administered antiretroviral therapy (DAART) for released HIV-infected prisoners; 50 (53%) selected BPN/NLX and were eligible to receive it for 6 months; the remaining 44 (47%) selected no BPN/NLX therapy. Maximum viral suppression (MVS), defined as HIV-1 RNA<50 copies/mL, was compared for the BPN/NLX and non-BPN/NLX (N = 44) groups. Results The two groups were similar, except the BPN/NLX group was significantly more likely to be Hispanic (56.0% v 20.4%), from Hartford (74.4% v 47.7%) and have higher mean global health quality of life indicator scores (54.18 v 51.40). MVS after 24 weeks of being released was statistically correlated with 24-week retention on BPN/NLX [AOR = 5.37 (1.15, 25.1)], having MVS at the time of prison-release [AOR = 10.5 (3.21, 34.1)] and negatively with being Black [AOR = 0.13 (0.03, 0.68)]. Receiving DAART or methadone did not correlate with MVS. Conclusions In recognition that OD is a chronic relapsing disease, strategies that initiate and retain HIV-infected prisoners with OD on BPN/NLX is an important strategy for improving HIV treatment outcomes as a community transition strategy."
https://openalex.org/W2151334199,"The human gut harbors thousands of bacterial taxa. A profusion of metagenomic sequence data has been generated from human stool samples in the last few years, raising the question of whether more taxa remain to be identified. We assessed metagenomic data generated by the Human Microbiome Project Consortium to determine if novel taxa remain to be discovered in stool samples from healthy individuals. To do this, we established a rigorous bioinformatics pipeline that uses sequence data from multiple platforms (Illumina GAIIX and Roche 454 FLX Titanium) and approaches (whole-genome shotgun and 16S rDNA amplicons) to validate novel taxa. We applied this approach to stool samples from 11 healthy subjects collected as part of the Human Microbiome Project. We discovered several low-abundance, novel bacterial taxa, which span three major phyla in the bacterial tree of life. We determined that these taxa are present in a larger set of Human Microbiome Project subjects and are found in two sampling sites (Houston and St. Louis). We show that the number of false-positive novel sequences (primarily chimeric sequences) would have been two orders of magnitude higher than the true number of novel taxa without validation using multiple datasets, highlighting the importance of establishing rigorous standards for the identification of novel taxa in metagenomic data. The majority of novel sequences are related to the recently discovered genus Barnesiella, further encouraging efforts to characterize the members of this genus and to study their roles in the microbial communities of the gut. A better understanding of the effects of less-abundant bacteria is important as we seek to understand the complex gut microbiome in healthy individuals and link changes in the microbiome to disease."
https://openalex.org/W2062784691,"Plant genes that contain the G-box in their promoters are responsive to a variety of environmental stimuli. Bioinformatics analysis of transcriptome data revealed that the G-box element is significantly enriched in promoters of high light-responsive genes. From nuclear extracts of high light-treated Arabidopsis plants, we identified the AtbZIP16 transcription factor as a component binding to the G-box-containing promoter fragment of light-harvesting chlorophyll a/b-binding protein2.4 (LHCB2.4). AtbZIP16 belongs to the G-group of Arabidopsis basic region leucine zipper (bZIP) type transcription factors. Although AtbZIP16 and its close homologues AtbZIP68 and AtGBF1 bind the G-box, they do not bind the mutated half-sites of the G-box palindrome. In addition, AtbZIP16 interacts with AtbZIP68 and AtGBF1 in the yeast two-hybrid system. A conserved Cys residue was shown to be necessary for redox regulation and enhancement of DNA binding activity in all three proteins. Furthermore, transgenic Arabidopsis lines overexpressing the wild type version of bZIP16 and T-DNA insertion mutants for bZIP68 and GBF1 demonstrated impaired regulation of LHCB2.4 expression. Finally, overexpression lines for the mutated Cys variant of bZIP16 provided support for the biological significance of Cys(330) in redox regulation of gene expression. Thus, our results suggest that environmentally induced changes in the redox state regulate the activity of members of the G-group of bZIP transcription factors."

In this report, we have investigated the molecular mechanism which elucidates the inhibitory effects of dexamethasone on murine osteoblastic MC3T3-E1 cells. It was found that the inhibitory effects were largely attributed to apoptosis and G1 phase arrest. Both the cell cycle arrest and apoptosis were dependent on glucocorticoid receptor (GR), as they were abolished by GR blocker RU486 pre-treatment and GR interference. G1 phase arrest and apoptosis were accompanied with a p53-dependent up-regulation of p21 and pro-apoptotic genes NOXA and PUMA. We also proved that dexamethasone can't induce apoptosis and cell cycle arrest when p53 was inhibited by p53 RNA interference. These data demonstrate that proliferation of MC3T3-E1 cell was significantly and directly inhibited by dexamethasone treatment via aberrant GR activation and subsequently P53 activation."
https://openalex.org/W2112493214,"The endosomal sorting complex required for transport (ESCRT) system traffics ubiquitinated cargo to lysosomes via an unusual membrane budding reaction that is directed away from the cytosol. Here, we show that human ESCRT-II self-assembles into clusters of 10-100 molecules on supported lipid bilayers. The ESCRT-II clusters are functional in that they bind to ubiquitin and the ESCRT-III subunit VPS20 at nanomolar concentrations on membranes with the same stoichiometries observed in solution and in crystals. The clusters only form when cholesterol is included in the lipid mixture at >10 mol %. The clusters induce the formation of ordered membrane domains that exclude the dye 1,1'-dioctadecyl-3,3,3',3'-tetramethylindodicarbo-cyanine perchlorate. These results show that ESCRT complexes are capable of inducing lateral lipid phase separation under conditions where the lipids themselves do not spontaneously phase-separate. This property could facilitate ESCRT-mediated membrane budding."
https://openalex.org/W2081966117,"Dysregulation of tight junctions (TJs) is often associated with human diseases including carcinogenesis and recent studies support role of TJ integral proteins in the regulation of Epithelial-to-Mesenchymal Transition (EMT). In this regard, expression of claudin-1, a key constituent of TJs, is highly increased in colon cancer and is causally associated with the tumor growth and progression. However, mechanism/s underlying regulation of claudin-1 expression in intestinal epithelial cells remains poorly understood. In our studies, we have identified putative binding sites for intestinal transcription factors Cdx1, -2 and GATA4 in the 5'-flanking region of the claudin-1 gene. Our further studies using full length and/or deletion mutant constructs in two different human colon cancer cell lines, SW480 and HCT116, showed key role of Cdx1, Cdx2 and GATA4 in the regulation of claudin-1 mRNA expression. However, overexpression of Cdx2 had the most potent effect upon claudin-1 mRNA expression and promoter activity. Also, in colon cancer patient samples, we observed a significant and parallel correlation between claudin-1 and Cdx2 expressions. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay confirmed the Cdx2 binding with claudin-1 promoter in vivo. Using Cdx2 deletion mutant constructs, we further mapped the Cdx2 C-terminus domain to be important in the regulation of claudin-1 promoter activity. Interestingly, co-expression of activated β-catenin further induced the Cdx2-dependent upregulation of claudin-1 promoter activity while expression of the dominant negative (dn)-TCF-4 abrogated this activation. Taken together, we conclude that homeodomain transcription factors Cdx1, Cdx2 and GATA4 regulate claudin-1 gene expression in human colon cancer cells. Moreover, a functional crosstalk between Wnt-signaling and transcriptional activation related to caudal-related homeobox (Cdx) proteins and GATA-proteins is demonstrated in the regulation of claudin-1 promoter-activation."

https://openalex.org/W1969882260,"The Human Microbiome Project (HMP) aims to characterize the microbial communities of 18 body sites from healthy individuals. To accomplish this, the HMP generated two types of shotgun data: reference shotgun sequences isolated from different anatomical sites on the human body and shotgun metagenomic sequences from the microbial communities of each site. The alignment strategy for characterizing these metagenomic communities using available reference sequence is important to the success of HMP data analysis. Six next-generation aligners were used to align a community of known composition against a database comprising reference organisms known to be present in that community. All aligners report nearly complete genome coverage (>97%) for strains with over 6X depth of coverage, however they differ in speed, memory requirement and ease of use issues such as database size limitations and supported mapping strategies. The selected aligner was tested across a range of parameters to maximize sensitivity while maintaining a low false positive rate. We found that constraining alignment length had more impact on sensitivity than does constraining similarity in all cases tested. However, when reference species were replaced with phylogenetic neighbors, similarity begins to play a larger role in detection. We also show that choosing the top hit randomly when multiple, equally strong mappings are available increases overall sensitivity at the expense of taxonomic resolution. The results of this study identified a strategy that was used to map over 3 tera-bases of microbial sequence against a database of more than 5,000 reference genomes in just over a month."
https://openalex.org/W2014136051,"Background The rotational vestibulo-ocular reflex (rVOR) generates compensatory eye movements in response to rotational head accelerations. The velocity-storage mechanism (VSM), which is controlled by the vestibulo-cerebellar nodulus and uvula, determines the rVOR time constant. In healthy subjects, it has been suggested that self-motion perception in response to earth-vertical axis rotations depends on the VSM in a similar way as reflexive eye movements. We aimed at further investigating this hypothesis and speculated that if the rVOR and rotational self-motion perception share a common VSM, alteration in the latter, such as those occurring after a loss of the regulatory control by vestibulo-cerebellar structures, would result in similar reflexive and perceptual response changes. We therefore set out to explore both responses in patients with vestibulo-cerebellar degeneration. Methodology/Principal Findings Reflexive eye movements and perceived rotational velocity were simultaneously recorded in 14 patients with chronic vestibulo-cerebellar degeneration (28–81yrs) and 12 age-matched healthy subjects (30–72yrs) after the sudden deceleration (90°/s2) from constant-velocity (90°/s) rotations about the earth-vertical yaw and pitch axes. rVOR and perceived rotational velocity data were analyzed using a two-exponential model with a direct pathway, representing semicircular canal activity, and an indirect pathway, implementing the VSM. We found that VSM time constants of rVOR and perceived rotational velocity co-varied in cerebellar patients and in healthy controls (Pearson correlation coefficient for yaw 0.95; for pitch 0.93, p<0.01). When constraining model parameters to use the same VSM time constant for rVOR and perceived rotational velocity, moreover, no significant deterioration of the quality of fit was found for both populations (variance-accounted-for >0.8). Conclusions/Significance Our results confirm that self-motion perception in response to rotational velocity-steps may be controlled by the same velocity storage network that controls reflexive eye movements and that no additional, e.g. cortical, mechanisms are required to explain perceptual dynamics."
https://openalex.org/W2077482727,"Characterization of the collective behaviors of different classes of processive motor proteins has become increasingly important to understand various intracellular trafficking and transport processes. This work examines the dynamics of structurally-defined motor complexes containing two myosin Va (myoVa) motors that are linked together via a molecular scaffold formed from a single duplex of DNA. Dynamic changes in the filament-bound configuration of these complexes due to motor binding, stepping, and detachment were monitored by tracking the positions of different color quantum dots that report the position of one head of each myoVa motor on actin. As in studies of multiple kinesins, the run lengths produced by two myosins are only slightly larger than those of single motor molecules. This suggests that internal strain within the complexes, due to asynchronous motor stepping and the resultant stretching of motor linkages, yields net negative cooperative behaviors. In contrast to multiple kinesins, multiple myosin complexes move with appreciably lower velocities than a single-myosin molecule. Although similar trends are predicted by a discrete state stochastic model of collective motor dynamics, these analyses also suggest that multiple myosin velocities and run lengths depend on both the compliance and the effective size of their cargo. Moreover, it is proposed that this unique collective behavior occurs because the large step size and relatively small stalling force of myoVa leads to a high sensitivity of motor stepping rates to strain."
https://openalex.org/W2092735972,"NF-κB-inducing kinase (NIK) is a central component in the non-canonical NF-κB signaling pathway. Excessive NIK activity is implicated in various disorders, such as autoimmune conditions and cancers. Here, we report the first crystal structure of truncated human NIK in complex with adenosine 5'-O-(thiotriphosphate) at a resolution of 2.5 Å. This truncated protein is a catalytically active construct, including an N-terminal extension of 60 residues prior to the kinase domain, the kinase domain, and 20 residues afterward. The structure reveals that the NIK kinase domain assumes an active conformation in the absence of any phosphorylation. Analysis of the structure uncovers a unique role for the N-terminal extension sequence, which stabilizes helix αC in the active orientation and keeps the kinase domain in the catalytically competent conformation. Our findings shed light on the long-standing debate over whether NIK is a constitutively active kinase. They also provide a molecular basis for the recent observation of gain-of-function activity for an N-terminal deletion mutant (ΔN324) of NIK, leading to constitutive non-canonical NF-κB signaling with enhanced B-cell adhesion and apoptosis resistance."
https://openalex.org/W2159876933,"Testicular germ cell tumors (TGCTs) are highly responsive to and curable by cisplatin-based chemotherapy even in advanced stages. We have studied the molecular mechanisms involved in the induction of apoptosis in response to cisplatin, and found that proapoptotic Noxa is transcriptionally up-regulated following cisplatin exposure, even in the absence of p53, in NTERA2 cisplatin-sensitive cells but not in 1411HP-resistant cells. Blockade of Noxa reduced the apoptotic response of embryonal carcinoma (EC) NTERA2 cells to cisplatin. A detailed analysis of the Noxa promoter revealed that p73 and Sp1-like factors, Sp1 and KLF6, played key roles in the transcriptional control of this gene. Overexpression of TAp73 induced Noxa whereas the dominant negative isoform ΔNp73, reduced the levels of Noxa after cisplatin exposure in NTERA2 and 2102EP. Interestingly, down-regulation of Sp1 increased Noxa expression in response to cisplatin. However, blockade of KLF6 decreased cisplatin-induced up-regulation of Noxa in EC cell lines. In addition, tissue microarray analyses of TGCTs revealed that expression of Noxa correlates with good clinical prognosis in patients with embryonal carcinoma. Thus, our data show the transcriptional network that regulates Noxa in EC cells, which is key for their apoptotic response to cisplatin-based chemotherapy, and propose Noxa as a predictive factor of therapeutic response."
https://openalex.org/W2083944881,"The ras proto-oncogene is one of the most frequently mutated genes in human cancer. However, given the prevalence of activating mutations in Ras and its association with aggressive forms of cancer, attempts to therapeutically target aberrant Ras signaling have been largely disappointing. This lack of progress highlights the deficiency in our understanding of cellular pathways required for Ras-mediated tumorigenesis and suggests the importance of identifying new molecular pathways associated with Ras-driven malignancies. Cdc42 is a Ras-related small GTPase that is known to play roles in oncogenic processes such as cell growth, survival, invasion, and migration. A pan-dominant negative mutant overexpression approach to suppress Cdc42 and related pathways has previously shown a requirement for Cdc42 in Ras-induced anchorage-independent cell growth, however the lack of specificity of such approaches make it difficult to determine if effects are directly related to changes in Cdc42 activity or other Rho family members. Therefore, in order to directly and unambiguously address the role of Cdc42 in Ras-mediated transformation, tumor formation and maintenance, we have developed a model of conditional cdc42 gene in Ras-transformed cells. Loss of Cdc42 drastically alters the cell morphology and inhibits proliferation, cell cycle progression and tumorigenicity of Ras-transformed cells, while non-transformed cells or c-Myc transformed cells are largely unaffected. The loss of Cdc42 in Ras-transformed cells results in reduced Akt signaling, restoration of which could partially rescues the proliferation defects associated with Cdc42 loss. Moreover, disruption of Cdc42 function in established tumors inhibited continued tumor growth. These studies implicate Cdc42 in Ras-driven tumor growth and suggest that targeting Cdc42 is beneficial in Ras-mediated malignancies."
https://openalex.org/W2053328262,"In alveolate evolution, dinoflagellates have developed many unique features, including the cell that has epicone and hypocone, the undulating transverse flagellum. However, it remains unclear how these features evolved. The early branching dinoflagellates so far investigated such as Hematodinium, Amoebophrya and Oxyrrhis marina differ in many ways from of core dinoflagellates, or dinokaryotes. Except those handful of well studied taxa, the vast majority of early branching dinoflagellates are known only by environmental sequences, and remain enigmatic. In this study we describe two new species of the early branching dinoflagellates, Psammosa pacifica n. g., n. sp. and P. atlantica n. sp. from marine intertidal sandy beach. Molecular phylogeny of the small subunit (SSU) ribosomal RNA and Hsp90 gene places Psammosa spp. as an early branch among the dinoflagellates. Morphologically (1) they lack the typical dinoflagellate epicone-hypocone structure, and (2) undulation in either flagella. Instead they display a mosaïc of dinokaryotes traits, i.e. (3) presence of bi-partite trychocysts; Oxyrrhis marina-like traits, i.e. (4) presence of flagellar hairs, (5) presence of two-dimensional cobweb scales ornamenting both flagella (6) transversal cell division; a trait shared with some syndineansand Parvilucifera spp. i.e. (7) a nucleus with a conspicuous nucleolus and condensed chromatin distributed beneath the nuclear envelope; as well as Perkinsus marinus -like features i.e. (8) separate ventral grooves where flagella emerge and (9) lacking dinoflagellate-type undulating flagellum. Notably Psammosa retains an apical complex structure, which is shared between perkinsids, colpodellids, chromerids and apicomplexans, but is not found in dinokaryotic dinoflagellates."
https://openalex.org/W2000524665,"In Schwann cells, connexin 32 (Cx32) can oligomerize to form intracellular gap junction channels facilitating a shorter pathway for metabolite diffusion across the layers of the myelin sheath. The mechanisms of Cx32 intracellular channel regulation have not been clearly defined. However, Ca(2+), pH, and the phosphorylation state can regulate Cx32 gap junction channels, in addition to the direct interaction of protein partners with the carboxyl-terminal (CT) domain. In this study, we used different biophysical methods to determine the structure and characterize the interaction of the Cx32CT domain with the protein partners synapse-associated protein 97 (SAP97) and calmodulin (CaM). Our results revealed that the Cx32CT is an intrinsically disordered protein that becomes α-helical upon binding CaM. We identified the GUK domain as the minimal SAP97 region necessary for the Cx32CT interaction. The Cx32CT residues affected by the binding of CaM and the SAP97 GUK domain were determined as well as the dissociation constants for these interactions. We characterized three Cx32CT Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease mutants (R219H, R230C, and F235C) and identified that whereas they all formed functional channels, they all showed reduced binding affinity for SAP97 and CaM. Additionally, we report that in RT4-D6P2T rat schwannoma cells, Cx32 is differentially phosphorylated and exists in a complex with SAP97 and CaM. Our studies support the importance of protein-protein interactions in the regulation of Cx32 gap junction channels and myelin homeostasis."
https://openalex.org/W1974631556,"Pulmonary artery hypertension (PAH) patients exhibit elevated levels of inflammatory cytokines and infiltration of inflammatory cells in the lung. Concurrently, mutations of bmpr2, the gene encoding the type II receptor of bone morphogenetic proteins (BMP), are found in ∼75% of patients with familial PAH, but a possible nexus between increased inflammation and diminished BMP signaling has hitherto remained elusive. We previously showed that BMP4 triggers nuclear localization of the Myocardin-related transcription factor A (MRTF-A) in human pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells (PASMC), resulting in the induction of contractile proteins. Here we report the BMPR2-dependent repression of a set of inflammatory mediators in response to BMP4 stimulation of PASMC. Forced expression of MRTF-A precisely emulates the anti-inflammatory effect of BMP4, while MRTF-A depletion precludes BMP4-mediated cytokine inhibition. BMP4 and MRTF-A block signaling through NF-κB, the keystone of most pathways leading to inflammatory responses, at the level of chromatin recruitment and promoter activation. Moreover, MRTF-A physically interacts with RelA/p65, the NF-κB subunit endowed with a transcription activation domain. Interestingly, the MRTF-A-NF-κB interaction is mutually antagonistic: stimulation of NF-κB signaling by TNFα, as well as p65 overexpression, hinders MRTF-A activity and the expression of contractile genes. Thus, a molecular inhibitory pathway linking BMP4 signaling, activation of MRTF-A, and inhibition of NF-κB provides insights into the etiology of PAH and a potential focus of therapeutic intervention."
https://openalex.org/W2036330830,"The rate-limiting step of cardiac muscle relaxation has been proposed to reside in the myofilament. Both the rates of cross-bridge detachment and Ca(2+) dissociation from troponin C (TnC) have been hypothesized to rate-limit myofilament inactivation. In this study we used a fluorescent TnC to measure both the rate of Ca(2+) dissociation from TnC and the rate of cross-bridge detachment from several different species of ventricular myofibrils. The fluorescently labeled TnC was sensitive to both Ca(2+) dissociation and cross-bridge detachment at low Ca(2+) (presence of EGTA), allowing for a direct comparison between the two proposed rates of myofilament inactivation. Unlike Ca(2+) dissociation from TnC, cross-bridge detachment varied in myofibrils from different species and was rate-limited by ADP release. At subphysiological temperatures (<20 °C), the rate of Ca(2+) dissociation from TnC was faster than the rate of cross-bridge detachment in the presence of ADP. These results support the hypothesis that cross-bridge detachment rate-limits relaxation. However, Ca(2+) dissociation from TnC was not as temperature-sensitive as cross-bridge detachment. At a near physiological temperature (35 °C) and ADP, the rate of cross-bridge detachment may actually be faster than the rate of Ca(2+) dissociation. This provides evidence that there may not be a simple, single rate-limiting step of myofilament inactivation."
https://openalex.org/W2081548225,"In eukaryotes, for a protein to be synthesized, the 40 S subunit has to first scan the 5′-UTR of the mRNA until it has encountered the AUG start codon. Several initiation factors that ensure high fidelity of AUG recognition were identified previously, including eIF1A, eIF1, eIF2, and eIF5. In addition, eIF3 was proposed to coordinate their functions in this process as well as to promote their initial binding to 40 S subunits. Here we subjected several previously identified segments of the N-terminal domain (NTD) of the eIF3c/Nip1 subunit, which mediates eIF3 binding to eIF1 and eIF5, to semirandom mutagenesis to investigate the molecular mechanism of eIF3 involvement in these reactions. Three major classes of mutant substitutions or internal deletions were isolated that affect either the assembly of preinitiation complexes (PICs), scanning for AUG, or both. We show that eIF5 binds to the extreme c/Nip1-NTD (residues 1–45) and that impairing this interaction predominantly affects the PIC formation. eIF1 interacts with the region (60–137) that immediately follows, and altering this contact deregulates AUG recognition. Together, our data indicate that binding of eIF1 to the c/Nip1-NTD is equally important for its initial recruitment to PICs and for its proper functioning in selecting the translational start site.

Together, our data indicate that binding of eIF1 to the c/Nip1-NTD is equally important for its initial recruitment to PICs and for its proper functioning in selecting the translational start site. Translation is a fundamental process contributing to the regulation of gene expression, normal developmental processes, and occurrence of disease. It can be divided into initiation, elongation, termination, and ribosome recycling with the initiation phase serving as a target of the most regulatory pathways (for a review, see Ref. 1.Sonenberg N. Hinnebusch A.G. Regulation of translation initiation in eukaryotes: mechanisms and biological targets.Cell. 2009; 136: 731-745Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2233) Google Scholar). Undoubtedly, the start codon selection is the key step of this phase and in fact of translation in general as it sets the reading frame for decoding. Initiation at an incorrect codon will produce a completely miscoded protein, wasting valuable resources of the cell and creating a potentially toxic peptide. In contrast to prokaryotic cells, the mRNAs of which posses a Shine-Dalgarno sequence that ensures a direct placement of the start codon into the ribosomal P-site, eukaryotic ribosomes have to search a 5′-untranslated region (UTR) of an mRNA for the start codon by a successive movement called scanning. During this process, ribosomes have to read and respond to a variety of integrated yet not well understood signals that orchestrate the AUG recognition. These signals originate from mutual molecular and functional interactions between mRNA and ribosomes with a number of proteins called eukaryotic translation initiation factors (eIFs) such as eIF1A, eIF1, eIF2 (in the form of the eIF2·Met-tRNAiMet·GTP ternary complex (TC) 3The abbreviations used are: TCternary complexNTDN-terminal domainPICpre-initiation complexMFCmultifactor complexCTDC-terminal domainSDsynthetic defined mediumYPDyeast extract-peptone-dextrose mediumWCEwhole-cell extract3-AT3-aminotriazoleuORFupstream ORFscsingle copyhchigh copy. ), and eIF5. ternary complex N-terminal domain pre-initiation complex multifactor complex C-terminal domain synthetic defined medium yeast extract-peptone-dextrose medium whole-cell extract 3-aminotriazole upstream ORF single copy high copy. Upon initial binding of the latter factors to the 40 S small ribosomal subunit stimulated by the multisubunit eIF3 complex, eIFs 1 and 1A serve to stabilize a specific conformation of the 40 S head relative to its body that opens the mRNA binding channel for mRNA recruitment to form the 48 S pre-initiation complex (PIC). That requires dissolving the latch formed by helices 18 and 34 of 18 S rRNA and establishing a new interaction between Rps3 and helix 16 (2.Passmore L.A. Schmeing T.M. Maag D. Applefield D.J.

This so-called open/scanning-conducive conformation with the anticodon of Met-tRNAiMet not fully engaged in the ribosomal P-site to prevent premature engagement with putative start codons is then maintained during scanning for the AUG start codon in an ATP-dependent process (for reviews, see Refs. 3.Hinnebusch A.G.

Protein Pept. Sci. 2012; 13: 305-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). During this search, eIF2 partially hydrolyzes its GTP with the help of the GTPase accelerating factor eIF5. Prior to start codon recognition, the “gate-keeping” function of eIF1 prevents the release of the resultant phosphate ion producing both GTP- and GDP·Pi-bound states of the factor possibly in equilibrium (5.Algire M.A. Maag D.

Encounter of the AUG start codon induces a reciprocal conformational switch of the 48 S PIC to the closed/scanning-arrested form stabilized by a functional interaction between eIF1A and eIF5 (6.Maag D.

This irreversible reaction serves as the decisive step in stalling the entire machinery at the AUG start codon and is triggered by displacement or dissociation of eIF1 (8.Cheung Y.N. Maag D.

In short, eIF1 and eIF1A (via its C-terminal tail) antagonize the codon-anticodon interactions in the P-site by blocking the full accommodation of initiator tRNA in the P-site in a manner that is overcome efficiently by the action of the N-terminal tail of eIF1A and eIF5 upon establishment of a perfect AUG-anticodon duplex in an optimal AUG context (for reviews, see Refs. 3.Hinnebusch A.G.

Specific mutations that reduce the stringency of start codon recognition in budding yeast, allowing increased utilization of near-cognate codons (UUG or AUU), produce the Sui− phenotype (suppressor of initiation codon mutation). Mutations with the opposite effect of lowering UUG initiation in the presence of a given Sui− mutation impart the Ssu− phenotype (suppressor of Sui−). Defects in AUG selection can also be identified by measuring the efficiency of initiation at the AUG of uORF1 in GCN4 mRNA in a well established in vivo GCN4-lacZ reporter system (for example, see Refs. 9.Elantak L.

In addition, yeast eIF3 is composed of six subunits (a/Tif32, b/Prt1, c/Nip1, i/Tif34, g/Tif35, and j/Hcr1), two of which directly interact with eIF1, TC, or eIF5 in the multifactor complex (MFC) (Fig. 1) (for a review, see Ref. 4.Valášek L.S. ‘Ribozoomin‘—translation initiation from the perspective of the ribosome-bound eukaryotic initiation factors (eIFs).Curr.

Indeed, several important segments (designated as Boxes) within the c/Nip1-NTD were identified previously; mutations of these segments impaired stringency of the start codon selection and produced either Sui− or Ssu− phenotypes in a manner intensified or suppressible by increased gene dosage of eIF5 or eIF1 (11.Valásek L.

Furthermore, increased frequency of skipping the AUG of uORF1 in the GCN4-lacZ reporter (a leaky scanning phenotype) was observed with mutations disrupting the web of mutual interactions among the members of an eIF3 module composed of the RNA recognition motif in the NTD of b/Prt1 and j/Hcr1 and the C-terminal domain (CTD) of a/Tif32 (Fig. 1) (9.Elantak L.

Based on these observations, we recently proposed that the scaffold b/Prt1 subunit serves to connect both eIF3 modules at each of its termini to work together with c/Nip1 and other eIFs to fine-tune the AUG selection process (13.Herrmannová A.

Structural analysis of an eIF3 subcomplex reveals conserved interactions required for a stable and proper translation pre-initiation complex assembly.Nucleic Acids Res. 2012; 40: 2294-2311Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). In this study, we subjected the aforementioned segments of the c/Nip1-NTD to semirandom mutagenesis to pinpoint critical residues that either promote the assembly of PICs (by screening for the Gcd− (general control derepressed) phenotype) or more importantly ensure stringent selection of the AUG start codon (by screening for the Sui− phenotype). Strikingly, we were able to separate the effects of distinct amino acid substitutions within a short 8-residue segment on the manifestation of either of the latter phenotypes, suggesting that the c/Nip1-NTD promotes both initiation reactions independently of each other at least to a certain degree. Based on our findings, we propose a model suggesting that not only the productive recruitment of eIF1 to 40 S ribosomes but also its proper functioning during the AUG recognition process depends on its contact with the stretch of amino acid residues 60–137 of the c/Nip1-NTD. HMJ04 and HMJ06 were generated by introducing YCpMJ-MET-Nip1-W into HLV04 and HKN06 (11.Valásek L. Nielsen K.H. Zhang F. Fekete C.A. Hinnebusch A.G.

https://openalex.org/W1967517825,"The specific detection of peroxidase activity in human granulocytes is essential to elucidate their role in innate immune responses, immune regulation, and inflammatory diseases. The halogenating activity of myeloperoxidase in neutrophils can be determined by the novel fluorescent probe aminophenyl fluorescein (APF). Thereby non-fluorescent APF is oxidized by HOCl to form fluorescein. We successfully verified that APF equally detects the hypobromous acid (HOBr)-producing activity of eosinophil granulocytes. This was revealed by three different approaches. First, we investigated the conversion of non-fluorescent APF into fluorescein by HOCl and HOBr by means of fluorescence and mass spectrometry approaches. Thereby comparable chemical mechanisms were observed for both acids. Furthermore in vitro kinetic studies were used to detect the halogenating activity of myeloperoxidase and eosinophil peroxidase by using APF. Here the dye well reflected the different substrate specificities of myeloperoxidase and eosinophil peroxidase regarding chloride and bromide. Finally, peroxidase activities were successfully detected in phorbol ester-stimulated neutrophils and eosinophils using flow cytometry. Thereby inhibitory studies confirmed the peroxidase-dependent oxidation of APF. To sum up, APF is a promising tool for further evaluation of the halogenating activity of peroxidases in both neutrophils and eosinophils."
https://openalex.org/W2057372272,"Luciferase reporter assays (LRAs) are widely used to assess the activity of specific signal transduction pathways. Although powerful, rapid and convenient, this technique can also generate artifactual results, as revealed for instance in the case of high throughput screens of inhibitory molecules. Here we demonstrate that the previously reported inhibitory effect of the Nod-like receptor (NLR) protein NLRX1 on NF-κB- and type I interferon-dependent pathways in LRAs was a nonspecific consequence of the overexpression of the NLRX1 leucine-rich repeat (LRR) domain. By comparing luciferase activity and luciferase gene expression using quantitative PCR from the same samples, we showed that NLRX1 inhibited LRAs in a post-transcriptional manner. In agreement, NLRX1 also repressed LRAs if luciferase was expressed under the control of a constitutive promoter, although the degree of inhibition by NLRX1 seemed to correlate with the dynamic inducibility of luciferase reporter constructs. Similarly, we observed that overexpression of another NLR protein, NLRC3, also resulted in artifactual inhibition of LRAs; thus suggesting that the capacity to inhibit LRAs at a post-transcriptional level is not unique to NLRX1. Finally, we demonstrate that host type I interferon response to Sendai virus infection was normal in NLRX1-silenced human HEK293T cells. Our results thus highlight the fact that LRAs are not a reliable technique to assess the inhibitory function of NLRs, and possibly other overexpressed proteins, on signal transduction pathways."
https://openalex.org/W1967462662,"T-type calcium channels operate within tightly regulated biophysical constraints for supporting rhythmic firing in the brain, heart and secretory organs of invertebrates and vertebrates. The snail T-type gene, LCav3 from Lymnaea stagnalis, possesses alternative, tandem donor splice sites enabling a choice of a large exon 8b (201 aa) or a short exon 25c (9 aa) in cytoplasmic linkers, similar to mammalian homologs. Inclusion of optional 25c exons in the III–IV linker of T-type channels speeds up kinetics and causes hyperpolarizing shifts in both activation and steady-state inactivation of macroscopic currents. The abundant variant lacking exon 25c is the workhorse of embryonic Cav3 channels, whose high density and right-shifted activation and availability curves are expected to increase pace-making and allow the channels to contribute more significantly to cellular excitation in prenatal tissue. Presence of brain-enriched, optional exon 8b conserved with mammalian Cav3.1 and encompassing the proximal half of the I–II linker, imparts a ∼50% reduction in total and surface-expressed LCav3 channel protein, which accounts for reduced whole-cell calcium currents of +8b variants in HEK cells. Evolutionarily conserved optional exons in cytoplasmic linkers of Cav3 channels regulate expression (exon 8b) and a battery of biophysical properties (exon 25c) for tuning specialized firing patterns in different tissues and throughout development."

Ex-vivo ileal mucosal biopsies were collected from the disease unaffected proximal margin of the ileum resected from patients who were undergoing initial intestinal surgery. Both RNA and DNA were extracted from the mucosal biopsy samples. Patients were genotyped for the three major NOD2 variants (Leufs1007, R702W, and G908R) and the ATG16L1T300A variant. Whole human genome mRNA expression profiles were generated using Agilent microarrays. Microbial composition profiles were determined by 454 pyrosequencing of the V3-V5 hypervariable region of the bacterial 16 S rRNA gene. The results of permutation based multivariate analysis of variance and covariance (MANCOVA) support the hypothesis that host mucosal Paneth cell and xenobiotic metabolism genes play an important role in host microbial interactions."
https://openalex.org/W2039304427,"Ligand-induced internalization of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is an important process for regulating signal transduction, cellular dynamics, and cell-cell communication. Here, we demonstrate that nonmuscle myosin II (NM II) is required for the internalization of the EGFR and to trigger the EGFR-dependent activation of ERK and AKT. The EGFR was identified as a protein that interacts with NM II by co-immunoprecipitation and mass spectrometry analysis. This interaction requires both the regulatory light chain 20 (RLC20) of NM II and the kinase domain of the EGFR. Two paralogs of NM II, NM II-A, and NM II-B can act to internalize the EGFR, depending on the cell type and paralog content of the cell line. Loss (siRNA) or inhibition (25 μm blebbistatin) of NM II attenuates the internalization of the EGFR and impairs EGFR-dependent activation of ERK and AKT. Both internalization of the EGFR and downstream signaling to ERK and AKT can be partially restored in siRNA-treated cells by introduction of wild type (WT) GFP-NM II, but cannot be restored by motor mutant NM II. Taken together, these results suggest that NM II plays a role in the internalization of the EGFR and EGFR-mediated signaling pathways."

https://openalex.org/W2018286305,"We examined the role of conceptual and visual similarity in a memory task for natural images. The important novelty of our approach was that visual similarity was determined using an algorithm [1] instead of being judged subjectively. This similarity index takes colours and spatial frequencies into account. For each target, four distractors were selected that were (1) conceptually and visually similar, (2) only conceptually similar, (3) only visually similar, or (4) neither conceptually nor visually similar to the target image. Participants viewed 219 images with the instruction to memorize them. Memory for a subset of these images was tested subsequently. In Experiment 1, participants performed a two-alternative forced choice recognition task and in Experiment 2, a yes/no-recognition task. In Experiment 3, testing occurred after a delay of one week. We analyzed the distribution of errors depending on distractor type. Performance was lowest when the distractor image was conceptually and visually similar to the target image, indicating that both factors matter in such a memory task. After delayed testing, these differences disappeared. Overall performance was high, indicating a large-capacity, detailed visual long-term memory."
https://openalex.org/W2015657283,"We have previously demonstrated a role for Nephrin in glucose stimulated insulin release (GSIR). We now hypothesize that Nephrin phosphorylation is required for GSIR and that Dynamin influences Nephrin phosphorylation and function. MIN6-C3 Nephrin-deficient pancreatic beta cells and human islets were transfected with WT-Nephrin or with a mutant Nephrin in which the tyrosine residues responsible for SH2 domain binding were substituted with phenylalanine (3YF-Nephrin). GSIR and live images of Nephrin and vesicle trafficking were studied. Immunoprecipitation experiments and overexpression of WT-Dynamin or dominant negative Dynamin mutant (K44A-Dynamin) in WT-Nephrin, 3YF-Nephrin, or Nephrin siRNA-transfected cells were utilized to study Nephrin-Dynamin interaction. In contrast to WT-Nephrin or to single tyrosine mutants, 3YF-Nephrin did not positively affect GSIR and led to impaired cell-cell contacts and vesicle trafficking. K44A-Dynamin prevented the effect of Nephrin on GSIR in the absence of protein-protein interaction between Nephrin and Dynamin. Nephrin gene silencing abolished the positive effects of WT-Dynamin on GSIR. The effects of protamine sulfate and vanadate on Nephrin phosphorylation and GSIR were studied in MIN6 cells and human islets. WT-Nephrin phosphorylation after glucose occurred at Tyr-1176/1193 and resulted in improved GSIR. On the contrary, protamine sulfate-induced phosphorylation at Tyr-1176/1193/1217 was associated with Nephrin degradation and impaired GSIR. Vanadate, which prevented Nephrin dephosphorylation after glucose stimulation, improved GSIR in human islets and MIN6 cells. In conclusion, Dynamin-dependent Nephrin phosphorylation occurs in response to glucose and is necessary for Nephrin-mediated augmentation of GSIR. Pharmacological modulation of Nephrin phosphorylation may thus facilitate pancreatic beta cell function."

Myosin-XXI, seemingly the only myosin isoform expressed in the protozoan parasite, has been detected in both the promastigote and amastigote stages of the Leishmania life cycle. It has been suggested to perform a variety of functions, including roles in membrane anchorage, but also long-range directed movements of cargo. However, nothing is known about the biochemical or mechanical properties of this motor. Here we designed and expressed various myosin-XXI constructs using a baculovirus expression system. Both full-length (amino acids 1–1051) and minimal motor domain constructs (amino acids 1–800) featured actin-activated ATPase activity. Myosin-XXI was soluble when expressed either with or without calmodulin. In the presence of calcium (pCa 4.1) the full-length motor could bind a single calmodulin at its neck domain (probably amino acids 809–823). Calmodulin binding was required for motility but not for ATPase activity. Once bound, calmodulin remained stably attached independent of calcium concentration (pCa 3–7). In gliding filament assays, myosin-XXI moved actin filaments at ∼15 nm/s, insensitive to both salt (25–1000 mm KCl) and calcium concentrations (pCa 3–7).

Leishmaniasis affects over 12 million people worldwide, with about 2 million newly infected patients each year. The disease is caused by the flagellated protozoan parasite Leishmania and can manifest itself as visceral leishmaniasis, which is potentially fatal, or cutaneous leishmaniasis, which can leave disfiguring mucocutaneous scars (1Desjeux P. Leishmaniasis. Current situation and new perspectives.Comp. Immunol. Microbiol. Infect. Dis. 2004; 27: 305-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (1732) Google Scholar).

The motor is preferentially localized to the proximal region of the flagellum but is also found in other flagellar and cell body compartments (6Katta S.S. Tammana T.V. Sahasrabuddhe A.A. Bajpai V.K. Gupta C.M. Trafficking activity of myosin XXI is required in assembly of Leishmania flagellum.J. Cell Sci. 2010; 123: 2035-2044Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Myosin-XXI expression depends on both the parasite life cycle (5Katta S.S. Sahasrabuddhe A.A. Gupta C.M. Flagellar localization of a novel isoform of myosin, myosin XXI, in Leishmania.Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2009; 164: 105-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) and on the growth phase of the parasite. For cultured promastigotes, expression levels were reported to increase almost 4.5-fold from early log phase of growth to stationary phase (6Katta S.S. Tammana T.V. Sahasrabuddhe A.A. Bajpai V.K. Gupta C.M. Trafficking activity of myosin XXI is required in assembly of Leishmania flagellum.J. Cell Sci. 2010; 123: 2035-2044Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Katta et al. (6Katta S.S. Tammana T.V. Sahasrabuddhe A.A. Bajpai V.K. Gupta C.M. Trafficking activity of myosin XXI is required in assembly of Leishmania flagellum.J. Cell Sci. 2010; 123: 2035-2044Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) showed that myosin-XXI is essential for survival of Leishmania promastigotes in culture and that a reduction in expression levels of myosin-XXI results in the loss of endocytosis within the flagellar pocket and impairment of other intracellular trafficking processes. In addition, myosin-XXI heterozygous cells failed to form the paraflagellar rod. The paraflagellar rod is a structure that runs along the length of the flagellum and contains a variety of proteins, including actin, but its functional role remains unclear (7Santrich C. Moore L. Sherwin T. Bastin P. Brokaw C. Gull K. LeBowitz J.H. A motility function for the paraflagellar rod of Leishmania parasites revealed by PFR-2 gene knockouts.Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1997; 90: 95-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). The detection of only a single myosin isoform in the parasite suggests that this myosin must carry out a variety of functions. Two distinct myosin-XXI populations have been identified. For the membrane-bound population, the tail domain localizes the motor molecules at the base of the flagellum, whereas the detergent-soluble subfraction could be involved in the transport of proteins within the flagellum (5Katta S.S. Sahasrabuddhe A.A. Gupta C.M. Flagellar localization of a novel isoform of myosin, myosin XXI, in Leishmania.Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2009; 164: 105-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The myosin superfamily is composed of 36 classes (3Foth B.J. Goedecke M.C. Soldati D. New insights into myosin evolution and classification.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2006; 103: 3681-3686Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar, 4Odronitz F. Kollmar M. Drawing the tree of eukaryotic life based on the analysis of 2,269 manually annotated myosins from 328 species.Genome Biol. 2007; 8: R196Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). Myosins consist of a highly conserved motor domain followed by a neck domain of variable length, often including IQ motifs for the binding of light chains of the calmodulin family, and finally a tail domain, which can contain a large variety of motifs (8Krendel M. Mooseker M.S. Myosins. Tails (and heads) of functional diversity.Physiology. 2005; 20: 239-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). Although the motor domain is responsible for the binding to actin and hydrolysis of ATP, it is the tail domain that determines function within the cell by controlling molecular dimerization and motor processivity, motor anchoring to the membrane, and/or selection and transport of specific cargo. Although myosin-XXI does not contain perfect IQ motifs in the neck domain, there are several less well characterized, degenerative IQ domains present. Subsequent to the converter domain, the proximal tail contains a natural “leucine zipper” motif that is followed by a predicted short coiled-coil domain (MARCOIL) (9Delorenzi M. Speed T. An HMM model for coiled-coil domains and a comparison with PSSM-based predictions.Bioinformatics. 2002; 18: 617-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar) and, finally, near the C terminus, two tandem ubiquitin-associated domains (UBA) 2The abbreviations used are: UBAubiquitin-associated domainaaamino acid(s)SECsize exclusion chromatographyFL-XXIfull-length Leishmania myosin-XXI heavy chainSAHsingle α-helical. (Fig. 1A). UBAs are found in a variety of proteins, including members of the ubiquitination pathway, UV excision repair proteins, and certain protein kinases. However, their function is not entirely clear (10Dikic I. Wakatsuki S. Walters K.J. Ubiquitin-binding domains. From structures to functions.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2009; 10: 659-671Crossref PubMed Scopus (622) Google Scholar). They have been shown to bind ubiquitin and dimerize in a mutually exclusive way (11Long J. Garner T.P. Pandya M.J. Craven C.J. Chen P. Shaw B. Williamson M.P. Layfield R. Searle M.S. Dimerisation of the UBA domain of p62 inhibits ubiquitin binding and regulates NF-κB signalling.J. Mol. Biol. 2010; 396: 178-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). They have also been shown to act as a stabilization signal that protects proteins from proteasomal degradation (12Heinen C. Acs K. Hoogstraten D. Dantuma N.P. C-terminal UBA domains protect ubiquitin receptors by preventing initiation of protein degradation.Nat. Commun. 2011; 2: 191Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Within the myosin family, UBAs are unique to myosin-XXI, and their role is unknown. ubiquitin-associated domain amino acid(s) size exclusion chromatography full-length Leishmania myosin-XXI heavy chain single α-helical. Controlling expression levels is one mechanism for regulating where and when a myosin is used. However, in a simplified system with only two myosins present in the genome, there clearly must be other mechanisms that allow myosin-XXI to perform its different roles within the cell. The presence of two myosin heavy chain kinases (NCBI accession numbers CBZ38915.1 and CBZ34699.1) and calmodulin in the L. donovani genome suggests other possible regulatory mechanisms. In this study, we expressed Leishmania full-length myosin-XXI and a truncated minimal motor domain in an Sf21/baculoviral system for biochemical and biophysical analysis. We show that myosin-XXI is an actin-activated ATPase that binds a single calmodulin that is required for motility but not for ATPase activity. EM imaging shows a monomeric molecule that seems to bind cooperatively to actin filament ends. Full-length myosin-XXI (3153 bp) cDNA (accession number FJ028724) was chemically synthesized and cloned into pUC57 (Genscript USA, Inc.). For purification, this construct was subcloned into the 6× His-tagged transfer vector pFastBacHbtm (Invitrogen) using standard PCR methods and oligonucleotides XXIFP6 (AGGATCCATGCCGGAGCGTGT-GTCTGTG) and XXIRP4 (AAAAGCGGC-CGCCTAGCTCACCTTGAACAGCATCTTAACGG) via BamHI/NotI sites. An aa 1–800 truncation of myosin-XXI was created using PCR and oligonucleotides XXIFP6 and XXITR6 (AAAAGCGGCCGCCTATTTCTCCGCCGGCACACC). The N terminus of full-length and truncated myosin-XXI was modified by addition of eGFP ligated into the BamHI site of pFastBactHbtm. Recombinant baculovirus DNA was generated by the Bac-to-Bac® method according to the instructions of the manufacturer and transferred into Spodoptera frugiperda (SF21) cells. Viruses were amplified to a P3 stock, and virus titer was determined before infection of cells for protein expression. Xenopus calmodulin was amplified from a P4 stock (gift of J. R. Sellers, NHLBI, National Institutes of Health), and the titer was determined. 500 ml of SF21 cells (1 × 106 cells/ml) were cultured in Grace's medium supplemented with 10% FCS (heat-inactivated). Normycin and pluronic were coinfected with full-length or truncated myosin-XXI plus calmodulin at a ratio of 2:1 multiplicity of infection. Infected SF21 cells were harvested after 72 h and washed once with PBS. The remaining steps were performed at 4 °C. Cells were resuspended in myosin extraction buffer as described by Margossian and Lowey (13Margossian S.S. Lowey S. Preparation of myosin and its subfragments from rabbit skeletal muscle.Methods Enzymol. 1982; 85: 55-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (825) Google Scholar) (300 mm KCl, 150 mm phosphate buffer (pH 6.8), 1 mm DTT, and EDTA-free protease inhibitor tablets (Roche)) and lysed by sonication (sonicator probe Bandelin HD 2070, 5 min total time, 15 s on and 15 s off, at 40% maximal power). The lysate was clarified by centrifugation at 50,000 × g for 20 min. The supernatant was immediately loaded onto a HisTrap FF column (GE Healthcare) on an ÄKTA purifier (liquid chromatography, GE Healthcare), washed with a low-His buffer (50 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 40 mm imidazole, 200 mm NaCl, 1 mm DTT) and eluted using His buffer plus 400 mm imidazole using a step program. Peaks were run on SDS-PAGE gels, and pure fractions were pooled and concentrated to ∼25 μm. This sample was diluted with glycerol 1:1 (v/v) and drop-frozen in liquid nitrogen. Two tail fragments of myosin-XXI (aa 730–1050 and aa 830–1050) fused with N-terminal mRFP were cloned into pET28a vector using standard PCR and oligonucleotides XXI-730FP (AGAGGCGGCCGCCGGCAAGACGAAGGTGTTCCTCC), XXI-830FP (AGAGGCGGCCGCCGCCGTCGAGGCGGACACGCGCG), and XXI-ENDRP (ACTCGAGCTAGCTCACCTT-GAACAGC). The restriction sites are shown in boldface. Xenopus calmodulin was cloned into the pET28a vector between the HindIII/XhoI sites using PCR and oligonucleotides CamXHindIIIFP (AAAAAGC TTTAATGGCTGACCAACTGACAGAAG) and CamXXhoI-RP (ACTCGAGTCACTTTGCTGT CATCATTTGTAC). Plasmids were transformed into BL21 (DE3) Star E. coli cells (Invitrogen). An overnight starter culture was used to inoculate 2 liters of 2YT medium supplemented with 25 μg/ml kanamycin. The cells were grown at 37 °C until they reached mid-log phase. At this point, 1 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside was added to the 2YT, and the growth temperature was simultaneously dropped to 27 °C. Growth was continued for a further 4 h before the cells were harvested and resuspended in a low-His buffer containing 20% sucrose. Cells were then stored at −80 °C until further use. Cells were lysed by sonication as described above, and soluble proteins were harvested by centrifugation at 50,000 × g for 20 min. Proteins were then loaded onto a HisTrap FF column and purified as described above. Proteins were concentrated to ∼2–4 mg.ml−1 using Amicon centrifuge concentrators and then frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80 °C. Following the method described by Coluccio (14Coluccio L.M. Differential calmodulin binding to three myosin-1 isoforms from liver.J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 2279-2284Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), purified myosin proteins at known concentrations were boiled for 150 s followed by centrifugation of the samples at 245,000 × g for 20 min to separate supernatant and pellets. The protein present in the supernatant was entirely assignable to calmodulin, as determined by SDS-PAGE, and concentrations were estimated by Bradford assay (15Bradford M.M. A rapid and sensitive method for the quantitation of microgram quantities of protein utilizing the principle of protein-dye binding.Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (215608) Google Scholar). The portion of the total protein in the original sample attributable to the heavy chain was determined by subtracting the amount of calmodulin from the protein concentration of the original sample. Protein concentrations were converted to molar quantities. 100 μl samples of purified protein were applied to a Superdextm-200 (10/300 GL) analytical column (GE Healthcare) or Superosetm-6 column (10/300 GL) equilibrated in 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 1 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm DTT and controlled using an ÄKTA purifier (see above). The column was calibrated with GFP, chymotrypsin A, ovalbumin, BSA, aldolase, catalase, ferritin, and thyroglobulin standards as described (16Lister I. Schmitz S. Walker M. Trinick J. Buss F. Veigel C. Kendrick-Jones J. A monomeric myosin VI with a large working stroke.EMBO J. 2004; 23: 1729-1738Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar) and according to the instructions of the manufacturer (GE Healthcare. The partition coefficient Kav for the standard proteins was calculated as follows (17Ohno H. Blackwell J. Jamieson A.M. Carrino D.A. Caplan A.I. Calibration of the relative molecular mass of proteoglycan subunit by column chromatography on Sepharose CL-2B.Biochem. J. 1986; 235: 553-557Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar): Kav=Ve-V0Vc-V0(Eq. 1) with Ve elution volume of the protein, Ve void volume, and Vc total volume of the column. Because the molecular weight determination of non-globular proteins may not correspond well to the calibration curves established for the globular calibration proteins, we related the Stokes radius Rs of the proteins, rather than their molecular weight, to their partition coefficient Kav and plotted Rs versus SQRT(-log(Kav)) (17Ohno H. Blackwell J. Jamieson A.M. Carrino D.A. Caplan A.I. Calibration of the relative molecular mass of proteoglycan subunit by column chromatography on Sepharose CL-2B.Biochem. J. 1986; 235: 553-557Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The 6–20% sucrose gradient contained 500 mm NaCl, 150 mm imidazole (pH 7.4), 10 mm Na2PO42− (pH 7.2), 5 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm EGTA. Samples of purified myosin-XXI (2 mg/ml) together with protein standards of 0.5 mg ovalbumin, 0.25 mg BSA, 0.5 mg aldolase, and 0.5 mg catalase were layered on top of the gradient in a volume of 200 μl. The gradients were centrifuged for 18 h at 4 °C at 38,000 rpm in an SW 40 Ti Beckman rotor. Following centrifugation, 263-μl fractions were dripped from the bottom and run on a 10% SDS-PAGE gel. The native molecular weight of myosin-XXI was calculated from its Stokes radius measured by gel filtration, and its sedimentation coefficient was determined by sucrose density gradient centrifugation using the following equation as described by Post et al.

Ca2+-actin monomers were converted to Mg2+-actin with 0.2 mm EGTA and 50 mm MgCl2 and then polymerized by dialysis into an assay buffer containing 25 mm KCl, 4 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 25 mm imidazole (pH 7.4). A 1.1 molar equivalent of phalloidin (Sigma) was used to stabilize actin filaments. ATP (Sigma) was purified by anion exchange chromatography to 99.7% purity, as determined by HPLC. Quantification was performed using a Cary 50 spectrophotometer (Varian) with the extinction coefficients of OD259 of 15,400 M/cm. Steady-state ATPase-activities were measured at 22 (± 0.1) °C in assay buffer supplemented with the NADH-coupled assay components (0.2 mm NADH, 2 mm phosphoenolpyruvate, 3.3 units/ml lactate dehydrogenase, 2.3 units/ml pyruvate kinase) and various actin concentrations (0–30 μm). The final [MgATP] was 2 mm. The myosin-XXI concentration was 100–300 nm. The assay was started by the addition of myosin-XXI. The change in absorption at A340 nm was followed for 5 min. All measurements were repeated at least three times. The kcat and Kactin values were determined by fitting the data to equation 3, Rate=Vo+(kcat[Actin]Kactin+[Actin])(Eq. 3) where Vo is the basal ATPase activity of myosin-XXI, kcat is the maximum actin-activated ATPase rate, and Kactin is the concentration of actin needed to reach half maximal ATPase activity (i.e. Km for actin). Rabbit skeletal G-actin was prepared and polymerized with Tetramethyl Rhodamine Isothiocyanate (TRITC)-phalloidin as described previously (19Pardee J.D. Spudich J.A. Purification of muscle actin.Methods Enzymol. 1982; 85: 164-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (980) Google Scholar). Motility assays were performed at 22 °C as described by Kron et al. (20Kron S.J. Toyoshima Y.Y. Uyeda T.Q. Spudich J.A. Assays for actin sliding movement over myosin-coated surfaces.Methods Enzymol. 1991; 196: 399-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). The assay buffer (as described in the previous section) was supplemented with a scavenger system (20 mm DTT, 0.02 mg/ml catalase, 0.1 mg/ml glucose oxidase, 3 mg/ml glucose) and 2 mm ATP. For motility assays at increasing ionic strength or calcium concentrations, the buffer was supplemented with KCl and CaCl2, respectively. Free calcium concentrations were calculated using maxchelator. Accordingly, solutions with pCa 3.1, 6.2, 6.8, and 7.2 where obtained by adding 2, 0.9, 0.7 and 0.5 mm CaCl2 to the assay buffer. For fluorescence imaging, TRITC-phalloidin-labeled actin filaments were excited with a 532-nm laser (5 milliwatt). Images were recorded every 10 s for a total period of 300 s. Only filaments moving continuously for at least 20 frames were included in the data analysis to determine the gliding velocity. Velocities were determined using the kinetic imaging motion analysis software GmimPro. Myosin-XXI was diluted to 100 nm in a buffer containing 25 mm KCl, 50 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 0.1 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm DTT. The protein was applied to UV-treated, continuous carbon-coated copper grids and negatively stained with 1% uranyl acetate as described (21Walker M.L. Burgess S.A. Sellers J.R. Wang F. Hammer 3rd, J.A. Trinick J. Knight P.J. Two-headed binding of a processive myosin to F-actin.Nature. 2000; 405: 804-807Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). Images were recorded on a JEOL JEM-1011 transmission electron microscope (Lehrstuhl Prof. Joachim Rädler, Physics Department, Ludwig-Maximilians-Universität, Munich, Germany). Full-length Leishmania myosin-XXI heavy chain (FL-XXI) and a truncated motor domain (aa 1–800) with and without a N-terminal eGFP tag (Fig. 1A) were cloned into the pFastBacHB vector and coexpressed in the presence and absence of Xenopus calmodulin using a baculoviral/Sf21 system. We used Xenopus calmodulin for coexpression because of its high sequence agreement with calmodulin found in L. donovani (see Fig. 4C). Approximately 5 mg of protein was obtained from 5 × 108 cells, and all constructs were stable with or without calmodulin coexpression, as shown by size exclusion chromatography (SEC) (Fig. 1D). SDS-PAGE indicated that coexpressed calmodulin binds to full-length myosin-XXI (Fig. 1, B and C). Consistent with this, an earlier elution (corresponding to a larger Stokes radius, see below) was found for FL-XXI, with calmodulin-bound FL-XXI compared with FL-XXI expressed in the absence of calmodulin, as shown using SEC (Fig. 1D). Both SDS-PAGE and SEC indicated that the truncated motor domain (aa 1–800) was unable to bind calmodulin when coexpressed in the same way as the full-length protein. This result suggested that calmodulin binds to full-length myosin-XXI downstream of amino acid 800 in the sequence. We analyzed the FL-XXI sequence for potential calmodulin-binding positions (22Cheney R.E. Mooseker M.S. Unconventional myosins.Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1992; 4: 27-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar, 23Rhoads A.R. Friedberg F. Sequence motifs for calmodulin recognition.FASEB J. 1997; 11: 331-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (742) Google Scholar). A total of 16 potential binding sites were mapped (red boxes, Fig. 1A). To determine the number of calmodulins binding to the FL-XXI heavy chain, we performed a calmodulin-binding assay as described by Coluccio (14Coluccio L.M. Differential calmodulin binding to three myosin-1 isoforms from liver.J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 2279-2284Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In short, samples of known protein concentrations were boiled, subsequently cooled down rapidly on ice, and centrifuged to separate soluble protein in the supernatant from insoluble protein in the pellet. The protein in the supernatant was entirely attributable to calmodulin, which refolds after temperature-dependent denaturation, in contrast to the myosin heavy chain. The heavy chain fraction in the original sample was calculated by subtracting the total amount of calmodulin detected in the supernatant from the starting concentration, and the stoichiometry between calmodulin and myosin heavy chain in the original sample was determined. The assay suggested that only a single calmodulin is bound to FL-XXI and confirmed that no calmodulin is bound to the truncation (Fig. 2, A and B), consistent with a single calmodulin binding downstream of aa 800. To further narrow down calmodulin-binding to potential binding sites, two myosin tail constructs of different lengths were expressed and purified using an E. coli expression system (Fig. 3A). We found that apo-calmodulin (i.e. calcium-free calmodulin) did bind very little or not at all to the tail fragments (Fig. 3, C and D). However, in the presence of calcium pCa 4.1, added calmodulin bound to the 730-tail fragment (Fig. 3E) but not to the 830-tail (C). Only a single calmodulin-binding motif is present between the end of the truncated myosin construct (aa 1–800) and the beginning of the 830 tail fragment (Fig. 4A), indicating that calmodulin probably binds to the motif at aa 809–823. The sequence in this region corresponds, at least in part, to a 1-2-6-7-11 (22Cheney R.E. Mooseker M.S. Unconventional myosins.Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1992; 4: 27-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar) and to a 1-8-14 (23Rhoads A.R. Friedberg F.

Gel filtration studies suggested, however, that the 730 tail construct (∼68 kDa), which contains this entire section, is monomeric. In these studies, the 730 tail construct eluted at roughly the same volume as the 830 tail construct (∼56 kDa), which does not contain the predicted coiled coil section (Fig. 3, C–E). In fact, the SEC studies showed three clear peaks for both of the constructs. These peaks were consistent with the monomeric 730 and 830 tail constructs on their own, the monomeric tail constructs with calcium-calmodulin-bound, and monomeric red fluorescent protein (∼30 kDa) and calmodulin (∼ 17 kDa) on their own. The presence of some abortive mRFP expression of the mRFP-tail fusion constructs was confirmed by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 3B). Peaks at elution volumes < 12 ml indicating tail fragment dimerization (i.e. > 100 kDa) were not observed. The small peak at ∼12 ml elution volume for the 830 tail might indicate some small fraction of 830 tails with bound calmodulin, possibl"

https://openalex.org/W2050508993,"Oct1 and Sox2 synergistically regulate developmental genes by binding to adjacent sites within promoters. We have investigated the kinetics of global intermolecular translocation of Sox2 and Oct1 between cognate sites located on different DNA molecules by z-exchange NMR spectroscopy. In the Hoxb1 promoter, the Sox2 and Oct1 sites are immediately adjacent to one another, and the intermolecular translocation rates are too slow to be measured by z-exchange spectroscopy. By introducing a 3-bp insertion between the Sox2 and Oct1 sites to mimic the spacing in the FGF4 enhancer, the interprotein contact surface is reduced, and the translocation rates are increased. Interaction between Sox2 and the POU-specific domain (POU(S)) of Oct1 does not affect the translocation mechanism but modulates the rates. Translocation involves only jumping (dissociation and reassociation) for Sox2, but both jumping and direct intersegment transfer (no dissociation into free solution) for Oct1. The dissociation (k(off) ∼1.5 s(-1)) and association (k(on) ∼5.1 × 10(9) m(-1)s(-1)) rate constants for Sox2 are reduced 4-fold and increased 5-fold, respectively, in the presence of Oct1. k(off) (∼3.5 s(-1)) for Oct1 is unaffected by Sox2, whereas k(on) (∼1.3 × 10(9) m(-1)s(-1)) is increased ∼13-fold. The direct intermolecular translocation rate (k(inter) ∼1.8 × 10(4) m(-1)s(-1)) for the POU(S) domain of Oct1 is reduced 2-fold by Sox2, whereas that for the POU homeodomain (POU(HD)) of Oct1 (k(inter) ∼ 1.7 × 10(4) m(-1)s(-1)) remains unaltered, consistent with the absence of contacts between Sox2 and POU(HD). The data suggest a model for the sequence of binding events involved in synergistic gene regulation by Sox2 and Oct1."
https://openalex.org/W2132366564,"Hearing requires proper function of the auditory hair cell, which is critically dependent upon its actin-based cytoskeletal structure. Currently, ten point mutations in nonmuscle γ-actin have been identified as causing progressive autosomal dominant nonsyndromic hearing loss (DFNA20/26), highlighting these ten residues as functionally important to actin structure and/or regulation. Two of the mutations, K118M and K118N, are located near the putative binding site for the ubiquitously expressed Arp2/3 complex. We therefore hypothesized that these mutations may affect Arp2/3-dependent regulation of the actin cytoskeleton. Using in vitro bulk polymerization assays, we show that the Lys-118 mutations notably reduce actin + Arp2/3 polymerization rates compared with WT. Further in vitro analysis of the K118M mutant using TIRF microscopy indicates the actual number of branches formed per filament is reduced compared with WT and, surprisingly, branch location is altered such that the majority of K118M branches form near the pointed end of the filament. These results highlight a previously unknown role for the Lys-118 residue in the actin-Arp2/3 interaction and also further suggest that Lys-118 may play a more significant role in intra- and intermonomer interactions than was initially hypothesized."
https://openalex.org/W2095300938,"Vms1 is a newly identified Cdc48-binding protein. The biological function of Vms1 remains obscure. Here, we show that both Cdc48 and Vms1, but not Cdc48 cofactors Ufd1 and Ufd2, are crucial for the degradation of Cdc13, a telomere regulator. Interestingly, both autophagy and the proteasome are involved in Cdc13 turnover. Toxicity associated with accumulation of large amounts of Cdc13 in vms1Δ or autophagy mutants underscores the significance of the proteolytic regulation of Cdc13. Because few ubiquitylated yeast proteins are known to be degraded by autophagy under non-stress conditions, the identification of Cdc13 as a target of autophagy provides a valuable tool to unravel the mechanism of autophagy-mediated selective protein degradation."

https://openalex.org/W2000832444,"Genetic variability is a key problem in the prevention and therapy of RNA-based virus infections. Infectious Salmon Anemia virus (ISAv) is an RNA virus which aggressively attacks salmon producing farms worldwide and in particular in Chile. Just as with most of the Orthomyxovirus, ISAv displays high variability in its genome which is reflected by a wider infection potential, thus hampering management and prevention of the disease. Although a number of widely validated detection procedures exist, in this case there is a need of a more complex approach to the characterization of virus variability. We have adapted a procedure of High Resolution Melting (HRM) as a fine-tuning technique to fully differentiate viral variants detected in Chile and projected to other infective variants reported elsewhere. Out of the eight viral coding segments, the technique was adapted using natural Chilean variants for two of them, namely segments 5 and 6, recognized as virulence-associated factors. Our work demonstrates the versatility of the technique as well as its superior resolution capacity compared with standard techniques currently in use as key diagnostic tools."
https://openalex.org/W2086333895,"The shrimp fishery is the most economically important fishery in Mexico. The trawler-based portion of this fishery results in high rates of by-catch. This study quantifies and describes the biodiversity of by-catch associated with trawling in the Bahía de Kino region of Sonora, Mexico. Data were collected from 55 trawls, on six boats, over 14 nights, during November of 2003, 2004, 2006-2009. By-catch rates within trawl samples averaged 85.9% measured by weight. A total of 183 by-catch species were identified during the course of this study, including 97 species of bony fish from 43 families, 19 species of elasmobranchs from 12 families, 66 species of invertebrates from eight phyla, and one species of marine turtle; seven of the documented by-catch species are listed on the IUCN Red List, CITES, or the Mexican NOM-059-ECOL-2010; 35 species documented in the by-catch are also targeted by local artisanal fishers. Some of the species frequently captured as juveniles in the by-catch are economically important to small-scale fishers in the region, and are particularly sensitive to overexploitation due to their life histories. This study highlights the need for further research quantifying the impacts of high levels of by-catch upon small-scale fishing economies in the region and presents strong ecological and economic rationale for by-catch management within the shrimp fishery of the Gulf of California. Site-specific by-catch management plans should be piloted in the Bahía de Kino region to address the growing momentum in national and international fisheries policy regimes toward the reduction of by-catch in shrimp fisheries."
https://openalex.org/W2107345185,"As metagenomic studies continue to increase in their number, sequence volume and complexity, the scalability of biological analysis frameworks has become a rate-limiting factor to meaningful data interpretation. To address this issue, we have developed JCVI Metagenomics Reports (METAREP) as an open source tool to query, browse, and compare extremely large volumes of metagenomic annotations. Here we present improvements to this software including the implementation of a dynamic weighting of taxonomic and functional annotation, support for distributed searches, advanced clustering routines, and integration of additional annotation input formats. The utility of these improvements to data interpretation are demonstrated through the application of multiple comparative analysis strategies to shotgun metagenomic data produced by the National Institutes of Health Roadmap for Biomedical Research Human Microbiome Project (HMP) (http://nihroadmap.nih.gov). Specifically, the scalability of the dynamic weighting feature is evaluated and established by its application to the analysis of over 400 million weighted gene annotations derived from 14 billion short reads as predicted by the HMP Unified Metabolic Analysis Network (HUMAnN) pipeline. Further, the capacity of METAREP to facilitate the identification and simultaneous comparison of taxonomic and functional annotations including biological pathway and individual enzyme abundances from hundreds of community samples is demonstrated by providing scenarios that describe how these data can be mined to answer biological questions related to the human microbiome. These strategies provide users with a reference of how to conduct similar large-scale metagenomic analyses using METAREP with their own sequence data, while in this study they reveal insights into the nature and extent of variation in taxonomic and functional profiles across body habitats and individuals. Over one thousand HMP WGS datasets and the latest open source code are available at http://www.jcvi.org/hmp-metarep."
https://openalex.org/W1995074805,"The structure of a putative protease from Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron features an unprecedented binding site for flavin mononucleotide. The flavin isoalloxazine ring is sandwiched between two tryptophan residues in the interface of the dimeric protein. We characterized the recombinant protein with regard to its affinity for naturally occurring flavin derivatives and several chemically modified flavin analogs. Dissociation constants were determined by isothermal titration calorimetry. The protein has high affinity to naturally occurring flavin derivatives, such as riboflavin, FMN, and FAD, as well as lumichrome, a photodegradation product of flavins. Similarly, chemically modified flavin analogs showed high affinity to the protein in the nanomolar range. Replacement of the tryptophan by phenylalanine gave rise to much weaker binding, whereas in the tryptophan to alanine variant, flavin binding was abolished. We propose that the protein is an unspecific scavenger of flavin compounds and may serve as a storage protein in vivo."
