https://openalex.org/W2004264607,"An optical cavity enhances the interaction between atoms and light, and the rate of coherent atom-photon coupling can be made larger than all decoherence rates of the system. For single atoms, this 'strong coupling regime' of cavity quantum electrodynamics has been the subject of many experimental advances. Efforts have been made to control the coupling rate by trapping the atom and cooling it towards the motional ground state; the latter has been achieved in one dimension so far. For systems of many atoms, the three-dimensional ground state of motion is routinely achieved in atomic Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs). Although experiments combining BECs and optical cavities have been reported recently, coupling BECs to cavities that are in the strong-coupling regime for single atoms has remained an elusive goal. Here we report such an experiment, made possible by combining a fibre-based cavity with atom-chip technology. This enables single-atom cavity quantum electrodynamics experiments with a simplified set-up and realizes the situation of many atoms in a cavity, each of which is identically and strongly coupled to the cavity mode. Moreover, the BEC can be positioned deterministically anywhere within the cavity and localized entirely within a single antinode of the standing-wave cavity field; we demonstrate that this gives rise to a controlled, tunable coupling rate. We study the heating rate caused by a cavity transmission measurement as a function of the coupling rate and find no measurable heating for strongly coupled BECs. The spectrum of the coupled atoms-cavity system, which we map out over a wide range of atom numbers and cavity-atom detunings, shows vacuum Rabi splittings exceeding 20 gigahertz, as well as an unpredicted additional splitting, which we attribute to the atomic hyperfine structure. We anticipate that the system will be suitable as a light-matter quantum interface for quantum information."

Here, we present the first study on the susceptibility of Ae. albopictus populations to sympatric CHIKV isolates from La Réunion Island and compare it to other virus/vector combinations. Methodology and Findings We orally infected 8 Ae. albopictus collections from La Réunion and 3 from Mayotte collected in March 2006 with two Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) from La Réunion: (i) strain 05.115 collected in June 2005 with an Alanine at the position 226 of the glycoprotein E1 and (ii) strain 06.21 collected in November 2005 with a substitution A226V. Two other CHIKV isolates and four additional mosquito strains/species were also tested. The viral titer of the infectious blood-meal was 107 plaque forming units (pfu)/mL. Dissemination rates were assessed by immunofluorescent staining on head squashes of surviving females 14 days after infection. Rates were at least two times higher with CHIKV 06.21 compared to CHIKV 05.115. In addition, 10 individuals were analyzed every day by quantitative RT-PCR. Viral RNA was quantified on (i) whole females and (ii) midguts and salivary glands of infected females. When comparing profiles, CHIKV 06.21 produced nearly 2 log more viral RNA copies than CHIKV 05.115. Furthermore, females infected with CHIKV 05.115 could be divided in two categories: weakly susceptible or strongly susceptible, comparable to those infected by CHIKV 06.21. Histological analysis detected the presence of CHIKV in salivary glands two days after infection. In addition, Ae. albopictus from La Réunion was as efficient vector as Ae. aegypti and Ae. albopictus from Vietnam when infected with the CHIKV 06.21. Conclusions Our findings support the hypothesis that the CHIK outbreak in La Réunion Island was due to a highly competent vector Ae. albopictus which allowed an efficient replication and dissemination of CHIKV 06.21."
https://openalex.org/W1986070497,"Cavity quantum electrodynamics (cavity QED) describes the coherent interaction between matter and an electromagnetic field confined within a resonator structure, and is providing a useful platform for developing concepts in quantum information processing. By using high-quality resonators, a strong coupling regime can be reached experimentally in which atoms coherently exchange a photon with a single light-field mode many times before dissipation sets in. This has led to fundamental studies with both microwave and optical resonators. To meet the challenges posed by quantum state engineering and quantum information processing, recent experiments have focused on laser cooling and trapping of atoms inside an optical cavity. However, the tremendous degree of control over atomic gases achieved with Bose-Einstein condensation has so far not been used for cavity QED. Here we achieve the strong coupling of a Bose-Einstein condensate to the quantized field of an ultrahigh-finesse optical cavity and present a measurement of its eigenenergy spectrum. This is a conceptually new regime of cavity QED, in which all atoms occupy a single mode of a matter-wave field and couple identically to the light field, sharing a single excitation. This opens possibilities ranging from quantum communication to a wealth of new phenomena that can be expected in the many-body physics of quantum gases with cavity-mediated interactions."

https://openalex.org/W2052642820,"Human papillomaviruses (HPVs) are involved in the pathogenesis of cancer of the cervix (CaCx). MicroRNA (miRNA) expression analysis using Ambion (Austin, TX, USA) arrays showed that three miRNAs were overexpressed and 24 underexpressed in cervical cell lines containing integrated HPV-16 DNA compared to the normal cervix. Furthermore, nine miRNAs were overexpressed and one underexpressed in integrated HPV-16 cell lines compared to the HPV-negative CaCx cell line C-33A. Based on microarray and/or quantitative real-time PCR and northern blot analyses, microRNA-218 (miR-218) was specifically underexpressed in HPV-positive cell lines, cervical lesions and cancer tissues containing HPV-16 DNA compared to both C-33A and the normal cervix. Expression of the E6 oncogene of high-risk HPV-16, but not that of low-risk HPV-6, reduced miR-218 expression, and conversely, RNA interference of E6/E7 oncogenes in an HPV-16-positive cell line increased miR-218 expression. We also demonstrate that the epithelial cell-specific marker LAMB3 is a target of miR-218. We also show that LAMB3 expression is increased in the presence of the HPV-16 E6 oncogene and this effect is mediated through miR-218. These findings may contribute to a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms involved in cervical carcinogenesis."

https://openalex.org/W2152275638,"Programmed cell death (PCD) is a genetically controlled cell death that is regulated during development and activated in response to environmental stresses or pathogen infection. The degree of conservation of PCD across kingdoms and phylum is not yet clear; however, whereas caspases are proteases that act as key components of animal apoptosis, plants have no orthologous caspase sequences in their genomes. The discovery of plant and fungi metacaspases as proteases most closely related to animal caspases led to the hypothesis that metacaspases are the functional homologues of animal caspases in these organisms. Arabidopsis thaliana has nine metacaspase genes, and so far it is unknown which members of the family if any are involved in the regulation of PCD. We show here that metacaspase-8 (AtMC8) is a member of the gene family strongly up-regulated by oxidative stresses caused by UVC, H2O2, or methyl viologen. This up-regulation was dependent of RCD1, a mediator of the oxidative stress response. Recombinant metacaspase-8 cleaved after arginine, had a pH optimum of 8, and complemented the H2O2 no-death phenotype of a yeast metacaspase knock-out. Overexpressing AtMC8 up-regulated PCD induced by UVC or H2O2, and knocking out AtMC8 reduced cell death triggered by UVC and H2O2 in protoplasts. Knock-out seeds and seedlings had an increased tolerance to the herbicide methyl viologen. We suggest that metacaspase-8 is part of an evolutionary conserved PCD pathway activated by oxidative stress.

However, sequencing the Arabidopsis genome revealed that very few of the animal PCD regulators are conserved in plants. This suggests a greater divergence of the PCD pathways across kingdoms than thought. Initial reports seemed to provide indirect evidence supporting the existence of caspase orthologues in plants, with several caspase-like activities detected in plant extracts and inhibitor studies that show them to be required for PCD (for review, see Ref. 1Rotari V.I. Rui H. Gallois P. Physiol. Plant. 2005; 123: 376-385Crossref Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Although several research groups reported the absence of orthologous caspase sequences in plant genomes, a more in depth analysis revealed a greater diversity of caspase-related proteases than previously suspected (2Uren A.G. O'Rourke K. Aravind L.A. Pisabarro M.T. Seshagiri S. Koonin E.V. Dixit V.M. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 961-967Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In particular, two families of predicted proteases were identified that are more closely related to animal caspases than to other proteases: the paracaspases and metacaspases. Paracaspases and caspases appear animal specific, whereas metacaspases are present in other eukaryotes, including plants. Plant metacaspases are subdivided in type I and type II on the basis of their structure; type I have an N-terminal prodomain that is not present in type II. A role for metacaspases in plant PCD was proposed (3Koonin E. Aravind L. Cell Death Differ. 2002; 9: 394-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar) for four reasons; 1) a common origin with caspases, 2) the absence of closer caspase homologues in plants, 3) the proliferation of the genes coding for metacaspases in plant genomes mirrors the pattern of the proliferation and specialization of caspases in animal genomes, and 4) the fusion of type I plant metacaspases with a zinc-finger domain also present in LSD1, a regulator of the hypersensitive response in plants (4Dietrich R.A. Richberg M.H. Schmidt R. Dean C. Dangl J.L. Cell. 1997; 88: 685-694Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar). Early observations suggested that metacaspases could be responsible for caspase-like activities detected in plants (5Madeo F. Herker E. Maldener C. Wissing S. Lachelt S. Herlan M. Fehr M. Lauber K. Sigrist S.J. Wesselborg S. Frohlich K.U. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 911-917Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (720) Google Scholar, 6Bozhkov P.V. Filonova L.H. Suarez M.F. Helmersson A. Smertenko A.P. Zhivotovsky B. von Arnold S. Cell Death Differ. 2004; 11: 175-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar); however, three reports have now demonstrated that metacaspases are unable to cleave caspase substrates. So far, all four recombinant Arabidopsis metacaspases tested have arginine as the preferred P1 amino acid in the cleavage site instead of caspase aspartic acid (7Watanabe N. Lam E. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 14691-14699Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). A recombinant metacaspase from pine showed the same preferred cleavage site with Arg in P1 (8Bozhkov P.V. Suarez M.F. Filonova L.H. Daniel G. Zamyatnin Jr., A.A. Rodriguez-Nieto S. Zhivotovsky B. Smertenko A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 14463-14468Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar).

Although metacaspases do not have caspase-like activities, there is strong support for a role in PCD. The yeast metacaspase (YCA1) knock-out survives in the presence of H2O2 (5Madeo F. Herker E. Maldener C. Wissing S. Lachelt S. Herlan M. Fehr M. Lauber K. Sigrist S.J. Wesselborg S. Frohlich K.U. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 911-917Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (720) Google Scholar), and the down-regulation of a metacaspase suppresses PCD in the suspensor cells of Picea abies embryogenic culture (9Suarez M.F. Filonova L.H. Smertenko A. Savenkov E.I. Clapham D.H. von Arnold S. Zhivotovsky B. Bozhkov P.V. Curr. Biol. 2004; 14: 339-340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Another report using Arabidopsis detected small but statistically significant changes in metacaspase KOs; KOs of Arabidopsis type II metacaspases had a reduced cell death, whereas KOs of type I metacaspases had an increased cell death when challenged by botrytis (10Van Baarlen P. Woltering E.J. Staats M. KanVan J.A.L. Mol. Plant Pathol. 2007; 8: 41-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). A study of botrytis infection in tomato further supported the idea that type II metacaspases may mediate cell death in response to necrotic pathogens, as pathogen exposure led to type II metacaspase up-regulation (11Hoeberichts F.A. ten Have A. Woltering E.J. Planta. 2003; 217: 517-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). In contrast, there is no support for a metacaspase role in PCD using a range of stresses in Trypanosoma brucei (12Helms M.J. Ambit A. Appleton P. Tetley L. Coombs G.H. Mottram J.C. J. Cell Sci. 2006; 119: 1105-1117Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) where metacaspases may function in cell proliferation and mitochondria biogenesis (13Szallies A. Kubata B.K. Duszenko M. FEBS Lett. 2002; 517: 144-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). A study using metacaspase KO strains in Aspergillus fumigatus found metacaspases required for phosphatidylserine exposure, a cellular marker of PCD but not for other markers such as activation of caspase-like activities and loss of viability (14Richie D.L. Miley M.D. Bhabhra R. Robson G.D. Rhodes J.C. Askew D.S. Mol. Microbiol. 2007; 63: 591-604Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Finally, it has been reported that Arabidopsis plants overproducing selected members of the metacaspase gene family had no obvious cell death-related phenotype (15Vercammen D. Belenghi B. van de Cotte B. Beunens T. Gavigan J.-A. De Rycke R. Brackenier A. Inze D. Harris J.L. Van Breusegem F. J. Mol. Biol. 2006; 364: 625-636Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Taken together, evidence is conflicting but certainly suggestive that some metacaspases may play a role in PCD, and some may not. Previously alluded to, the proliferation of metacaspase genes in plants may reflect some form of specialization. Arabidopsis thaliana has nine metacaspase genes, and it can be expected that some members of the family are involved in the regulation of PCD, and some may be involved in other processes. As an illustration of that, two type-I metacaspases (At5g64240 and At1g02170) are up-regulated in Arabidopsis plants 24 h post-infiltration with bacterial pathogens, whereas type II metacaspases are not significantly affected (7Watanabe N. Lam E. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 14691-14699Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). In addition, metacaspases can have different pH optima, suggesting various subcellular localizations (16Vercammen D. van de Cotte B. De Jaeger G. Eeckhout D. Casteels P. Vandepoele K. Vandenberghe I. Van Beeumen J. Inze D. Van Breusegem F. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 45329-45336Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar), and display different substrate affinities (7Watanabe N. Lam E. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 14691-14699Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). It is, therefore, important to analyze the function of each member of this gene family in Arabidopsis. In addition, different PCD pathways activated in plants may be either metacaspase-dependent or metacaspase-independent. This hypothesis is exemplified in yeast, where the single yeast metacaspase (YCA1) mediates PCD induced by H2O2 or acetic acid (5Madeo F. Herker E. Maldener C. Wissing S. Lachelt S. Herlan M. Fehr M. Lauber K. Sigrist S.J. Wesselborg S. Frohlich K.U. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 911-917Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (720) Google Scholar), by viruses (17Ivanovska I. Hardwick J.M. J. Cell Biol. 2005; 170: 391-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), and by hyperosmotic stress (18Silva R.D. Sotoca R. Johansson B. Ludovico P. Sansonetty F. Silva M.T. Peinado J.M. Corte-Real M. Mol. Microbiol. 2005; 58: 824-834Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar), but in contrast, it is not required for PCD during mating (19Zhang N.-N. Dudgeon D.D. Paliwal S. Levchenko A. Grote E. Cunningham K.W. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2006; 17: 3409-3422Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), triggered by ammonia (20Vachova L. Palkova Z. J. Cell Biol. 2005; 169: 711-717Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar), or induced by Bax expression (21Hauptmann P. Riel C. Kunz-Schughart L.A. Frohlich K.-U. Madeo F. Lehle L. Mol. Microbiol. 2006; 59: 765-778Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). We show here that Arabidopsis metacaspase-8, a type II metacaspase, is up-regulated by the oxidative stress caused by UVC and leading to PCD, and this up-regulation is RCD1-dependent. We have genetic evidence that metacaspase 8 is part of a PCD pathway induced by UVC, H2O2, or methyl viologen. This report contributes to our understanding of the organization of the metacaspase family in Arabidopsis and the origin of eukaryotic PCD. Plant Growth Conditions—Three A. thaliana ecotypes, Columbia (Col-0), Wassilewskija (WS), and Landsberg erecta (Ler) were used. Transgenic overexpressing metacaspase-8 were constructed in a Col-0 background. The AtMC8-1 (FLAG322_G10) line in a WS background was supplied by FLAGDB (FLAGDB, Institut National de la Recherche Agronomique, France), and AtMC8-2 (JII Gene Trap line GT_3_12679) in a Ler background was purchased from NASC. Salk_047489 Salk_047493 and Salk_063109 were purchased from NASC. The rcd1-1 mutant was provided by Dr. R. Ahlfors (University of Helsinki). Plants were grown at 22–23 °C in long day (16/8 h) or short day (8/16 h) photoperiod in Perceval growth cabinets. In vitro seedlings were grown in a Sanyo cabinet under continuous light at 22 °C. Plasmids—An AtMC8 ORF was obtained using RT-PCR and RNA from UV-treated seedlings using primers with Lic adaptors GAC GAC GAC AAG ATG GCG AAG AAA GCA CTT TTG and GAG GAG AAG CCC GGT CCG TAG CAT ATA AAT GGT TTA TCA AC. The full ORF was cloned into the pET-30 Ek/LIC vector (Novagen), which added a His tag at both termini and an S ·tag at the N terminus to give pLIC-AtMC8. A point-mutated form, pLIC -AtMC8C140A, was generated using the QuikChange mutagenesis protocol (Stratagene). The AtMC8 ORF was excised from pLIC-AtMC8 with the His and S tags using XbaI and SalI and ligated into pDH51 (22Pietrzak M. Shillito R.D. Hohn T. Potrykus I. Nucleic Acids Res. 1986; 14: 5857-5868Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar) using XboI and SalI to add a cauliflower mosaic virus 35 S promoter and terminator. The resulting plasmid was then restricted with PVU II to excise the AtMC8 coding sequence flanked with the cauliflower mosaic virus 35 S promoter and terminator. This fragment was ligated into the T-DNA vector pZP111b (23Hajdukiewicz P. Svab Z. Maliga P. Plant Mol. Biol. 1994; 25: 989-994Crossref PubMed Scopus (1315) Google Scholar) linearized using SmaI and dephosphorylated to give pZP111-AtMC8. pZP111-AtMC8C140A was generated the same way using pLIC-AtMC8C140A as a starting point. The wild type and the point-mutated AtMC8 ORF were cloned into the yeast vector pYES2 (Invitrogen) using XbaI and SacI to give pYES-AtMC8 and pYES-AtMC8C140A. Expression in Escherichia coli—pLIC-AtMC8 and pLIC-AtMC8C140A were transformed into BL21(DE3) competent cells (Invitrogen). Kanamycin-resistant colonies were grown to an absorbance of 0.5 and induced with 1 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside, 2%ethanol for 48 h at 22 °C. Proteins were extracted in ice-cold 500 mm NaCl, 50 mm K2PO4 pH7.4, 3mm dithiothreitol, 10%(w/v) glycerol, 1%(w/v) CHAPS, 5 μl·ml–1 aprotinin with a ratio of 200 μl/5 absorbance units. Cells were broken using a sonicator (Vibra Cell™, JECONS Sonics & Materials Inc.) with five short bursts of 10 s followed by intervals of 30 s on ice. A supernatant was obtained by centrifugation at 4 °C for 30 min at 16,000 rpm using a refrigerated microcentrifuge (Eppendorf). For purification, cell lysis was performed using a French press at 900 p.s.i. Cell debris were pelleted by ultracentrifugation at 4 °C, 25,000 × g for 1 h. His-tag purification was obtained using Talon magnetic beads (Dynabeads, Qiagen). Yeast Complementation—The yeast deletion strain yca1Δ (Y02453; yca1::kanMX4) in YOR197W and the wild type strain BY4741 (MATa his3Δ1 leu2Δ0 met15Δ0 ura3Δ0) were supplied by Euroscaf. pYES2 (Invitrogen) and pYES-AtMC8 were introduced in Y02453 and BY4741. The survival assay was carried out essentially as published (5Madeo F. Herker E. Maldener C. Wissing S. Lachelt S. Herlan M. Fehr M. Lauber K. Sigrist S.J. Wesselborg S. Frohlich K.U. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 911-917Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (720) Google Scholar). In short, yeast cultures were grown overnight with glucose or galactose, diluted to the same density, and then treated or not with 1.2 mm H2O2 (Sigma) for 24 h. Cells were counted using a Thoma double cell “Clearsight” chamber and 1000 cells plated on solid yeast extract/peptone/dextrose medium for each replicate. The survival rate was calculated using the number of colonies formed after 2 days at 30 °C. Plant Transformation—pZP111-AtMC8 and pZP111-AtMC8C140A were transformed into competent Agrobacterium tumefaciens GV3101 using electroporation. Agrobacterium strains were grown with appropriate antibiotics (20 mg·liter–1 gentamycin, 50 mg·liter–1 kanamycin, and 200 mg·liter–1 rifampicin) and used to transform Arabidopsis Col0 by the floral dip method (24Bechtold N. Ellis J. Pelletier G. C. R. Acad. Sci. Ser. 3 Life Sci. 1993; 316: 1194-1199Google Scholar) in 10 mm MgCl2, 300 μl·liter–1 Silwet L-77 with 30 s of vacuum infiltration. Transformed seeds were collected and selected on 50 mg.liter–1 kanamycin and 1% Bactoagar. RT-PCR—Total RNA was extracted from 3-week-old seedlings grown in vitro using Invisorb Spin Plant RNA mini kit (Invitek, Gmbh) according to the manufacturer's instructions and then treated with RQ1 RNase-free DNase (Promega) for 60 min. The treated RNA was used to perform cDNA synthesis using Reverse-iT™ First Strand Synthesis Kit (ABgene) following the protocol supplied with the kit. The resulting cDNA samples were used as templates for PCR reactions with Bioline Taq. To amplify the full-length ORF the following primers were used: MC8-ATG, 5′-TGG CGA AGA AAG CAC TTT TGA-3′; MC8-GGT, GGT CGT TGA CTA TAC CCC CGT. For expression studies the following primers were used: AtMC1-At1g02170, CTC CTC CGC AAC CTT CCT and CAT CAA CTT CAT CAC CGT TGT; AtMC2-At5g64240, TCT GGT CAT GGA TCT CAG CA and CTG TGT TCT TCC CCG TGA AC; AtMC3-At4g25110, TGG ACC ACA GGA CTT CAG GT and AAG CGC CTA AGA TGA GCA AA; AtMC4-At1g79310, TGA TTG ACA CCG ACG AAT CT and CTT CCG ATT CCA CAA AAA GC; AtMC5-At1g79340, GCT TGC TGA TCT CGT CGA A and GCT GCG CAA GAA CTT CCT AA; AtMC6-At1g79330, CGA AGG GCA TTG TTG AAT CT and GCT TCT TCC ACA GCT TCA CG; AtMC7-At1g79320, AGA TCT CGT TGA ACC GGC TA and TCC AAT GGC AGA GAT CTG TTT; AtMC8-At1g16420; GGA TAA TCT CAT CGC ATC AGG and GCT GCT TCA TAT GGC TTT CC; AtMC9-At5g04200, GTG TTC ACG GGG AAG AAC and GCG GAT GCA TCA GAG CTT; AtDAD1, GGA TGC TCA GGA TCT ATT TCG and GTG AAA CCT CTA TCC GAG GAA GTT G; Actin2, GTT AGC AAC TGG GAT GAT ATG G and CAG CAC CAA TCG TGA TGA CTT GCC C. Q-PCR—cDNA was synthesized as described in the RT-PCR method and used as templates in Q-PCR reactions using Taqman Master mix (Eurogentec) according to the manufacturer's instruction and an ABI 7000. For 18S detection, the primers 18 S-29F (5′-GGT CTG TGA TGC CCT TAG ATG TT-3′), 18 S-102R (5′-GGC AAG GTG TGA ACT CGT TGA-3′) and probe 18 S-58T (5′-CGC ACG CGC GCT ACA CTG ATG T-3′) were used. For Actin2 detection, the primers ACT2-123F (5′-GAG AGA TTC AGA TGC CCA GAA GTC-3′), ACT2-190R (5′-TGG ATT CCA GCA GCT TCC A-3′), and probe ACT2-148T (5′-TCC CAC AAA CGA GGG CTG CAA CA-3′) were used. For AtMC8 detection, the primers AtMC8-50F (5′-TGG AGT TAC GTG GCT GTG TCA-3′), AtMC8-124R (5′-TGT TGG CGA ACC CGT AAA G-3′), and probe AtMC8-79T (5′-CAC CGG ATG CAG AAA TGC CTA ATC GA-3′) were used. A standard curve using dilutions of Arabidopsis genomic DNA was used to calculate the absolute number of cDNA copies in each sample. H2O2 Measurement—The Amplex Red Hydrogen Peroxide/Peroxidase Assay kit (Invitrogen) was used to measure H2O2 production in 105 protoplasts. After a treatment with 50 kJ·m–2, the samples were kept in the light for 30 min before harvesting, and the Amplex Red reagent (10-acetyl-3,7-dihydrophenoxazine) was used according to the manufacturer's instruction. Protease Assay—Standard 2× assay buffer was 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 4 mm EDTA, 0.04% NaN3, 50 mm CaCl2, 6 mm dithiothreitol; the pH range was obtained using 100 mm sodium acetate for pH 4–5, 50 mm MES for pH 5.5–6.5, and 100 mm Tris-HCl for pH 7–9. Protein extracts were carried out in distilled water and 3 mm dithiothreitol. For plant extract the FW/buffer ratio was 1 g/2 ml. For yeast total protein was extracted from yeast cell pellets by adding glass beads and shaking with a Ribolyser. Protease activities were determined by incubation of 48 μl of plant extract (or 20 μl of yeast extract, 10 μl of E. coli extract, or 2 μl of purified AtMC8 made up to 48 μl with sterile distilled water), 50 μl of 2× assay buffer at different pH, and 50 μmt-butoxycarbonyl-GRR-aminomethylcoumarin (AMC) and benzyloxycarbonyl-FR-AMC (substrate for papain; Bachem Ltd). Ac-DEVD-AMC (substrate for caspase-3, -6, -7, -8, and -10; MP Biomedicals), Ac-VEID-AMC (substrate for caspase-6), Ac-YVAD-AMC (substrate for caspase-1), Ac-IETD-AMC (substrate for caspase-6 and -8, Granzyme B), and benzyloxycarbonyl-AAN-AMC (substrate for legumain) (Bachem) were used at 50 μm final. The release of AMC was measured every 2 min at 30 °C with a Microtiter Plate Fluorometer (Labsystems, DYNEX Technologies) using an excitation wavelength of 360 nm and an emission wavelength of 460 nm. Data time points were analyzed by the Fluoroskan Ascent software, and activities were expressed in fluorescence units/min/mg or μg of total protein. Protein concentration was measured using the Bradford reagent (Bio-Rad). Immunodetection—Antibodies used comprised a rabbit polyclonal raised against purified recombinant AtMC8 (by Eurogentec). Acrylamide gels were cast and run using a Bio-Rad mini gel apparatus. Western analysis was carried out according to Sambrook et al. (25Sambrook J. MacCallum P. Russell D. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 3rd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2000Google Scholar) using Hybond P (Amersham Biosciences). For signal detection ECL (Pierce) and Eastman Kodak Co. Biomax film were used. Ion Leakage—Seedlings were grown in soil under short days for 4 weeks and watered 24 h before the experiment to avoid ion leakage variation linked to variation in water status. 1100 μl of sterile distilled water was added in each well of a 24-well culture plate (Techno Plastic Products). 3-mm diameter discs were punched out from leaves, and 3 discs were floated in each well. At 0.5 h, the conductivity of the water in each well was measured using 100 μl and an HORIBA Twin Cond conductivity meter B-173 (HORIBA Ltd, Kyoto, Japan). Stress treatment were carried by applying UVC radiation using a CL-1000 UV cross-linker (UVP Ltd) or the addition of H2O2 (Sigma) to the discs to reach the doses required, and the discs were left in continuous light at 22 °C for 16 h. The conductivity of the liquid in each well was measured again, and the difference before and after treatment was calculated to represent the amount of cell death of each sample. Three wells were used for each treatment. Protoplasts and Evans Blue—Seedlings grown in vitro for 3–4 weeks were incubated with leaf digestion medium (4.41 g·liter–1 Murashige and Skoog (MS) medium including Gamborg B5 vitamins (Duchefa), 0.4 m sucrose, 0.96% cellulase R-10, and 0.64% macerozyme (Yakult Pharmaceutical), pH 5.8) in the dark for 16 h at room temperature. Buoyant protoplasts were harvested by centrifugation for 5 min at 600 rpm and washed 2–3 times in 12 ml of W5 medium (154 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 5 mm glucose, and 125 mm CaCl2, pH 5.6–5.8). The pellet was then resuspended in protoplast culture medium (4.41 g·liter–1 MS medium including Gamborg B5 vitamins, 0.4 m sucrose, 0.4 m mannitol, and 0.5 g·liter–1 MES, pH 5.8) at a density of 1 × 106 protoplasts per ml. For each replicate, 1 ml of protoplasts was used per well of a 6-well culture plate (Techno Plastic Products). Stress treatments were carried by applying UV radiation using a CL-1000 UV cross-linker (UVP Ltd) or exogenous application of H2O2 (Sigma) to wells in triplicate, and the protoplasts were left in continuous light for 4 h at 22°C. The dye Evans blue (Sigma) was added to protoplast suspension to the final concentration of 0.05%. After 5 min of room temperature incubation, an aliquot of the stained protoplasts was mounted on a slide. Pictures of at least four randomly selected fields of view (150–250 cells/field) were taken within 10 min. The ratio of number of Evans blue-stained cells over total cell number was calculated. All the microscopic work was carried using a Leica microscope connected to a digital SPOT camera. Germination on Methyl Viologen—Seeds were sterilized for 10 min in 70% ethanol and sown on MS media with Gamborg B5 vitamins (Duchefa), 0.5g/liter MES, pH 5.8, 0.7% phytagel (Sigma). Plates were supplemented with 0, 0.25, or 25 μm methyl viologen (Sigma). Seeds were incubated for 3 days at 8 °C and then germinated at 22 °C in continuous light. Germination was scored using a stereomicroscope. Digital pictures were taken with a Nikon D100. Each treatment was carried out in triplicate with at least 100 seeds. AtMC8 Expression Is Induced by Oxidative Stress and Correlates with Cell Death—We have previously shown that a UVC treatment can induce PCD in Arabidopsis (26Danon A. Gallois P. FEBS Lett. 1998; 437: 131-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Using RT-PCR and gene-specific primers, we analyzed the transcription during UVC-induced PCD of the nine metacaspases (AtMC1–9) that are present in the Arabidopsis genome. Three-week-old seedlings were treated with 50 kJ/m2 and kept in the light. Total RNA was extracted 30 or 120 min after treatment. We found that the AtMC-8 transcript (At1g16420) was the only metacaspase strongly up-regulated, with a peak 30 min after UVC treatment (Fig. 1A). We found no transcript for AtMC6 and AtMC7. AtMC1, -2, -3, and -5 were present and down-regulated by the UV treatment. AtMC-4 was expressed at a low level and slightly up-regulated with higher expression at 2 h. AtMC9 was slightly up-regulated. The expression of AtMC8 was then analyzed using Taqman Q-PCR. Q-PCR results (Fig. 1B) showed that a lethal UV dose of 50 kJ/m2 is required to induce the expression of AtMC8 80-fold using 18 S as a reference gene. Using ACTIN2 as a reference gene instead of 18S resulted in a calculated induction of 120-fold (data not shown) because UVC down-regulates ACTIN2. A sublethal dose of 1 kJ/m2 was ineffective, and a 10 kJ/m2 resulted in a 10-fold induction, indicating that expression of the AtMC8 transcript is proportional to the level of stress. To investigate whether AtMC8 induction could be linked either to the induction of PCD or linked to the general stress caused by the UV treatment, we analyzed its expression level under heat and light stresses thought to be associated with a UV treatment (Fig. 1B). Light stress (1000 μmol/m2/s), and heat shock (42 °C, 2 h) did not induce the expression of AtMC8. Finally, we have shown that UV-induced PCD is light-dependent (27Danon A. Rotari V.I. Gordon A. Mailhac N. Gallois P. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 779-787Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar), and our experiments showed that light was required after UVC treatment to induce AtMC8 expression, suggesting a correlation between the expression of AtMC8 and the induction of PCD. A light requirement suggested a link with oxidative stress. H2O2 production was measured using 105 protoplasts treated with 50 kJ·m–2 UVC and was found to be 8.5 μm, 30 min after treatment. Untreated protoplasts only generated 0.4 μm H2O2.H2O2 was found to induce AtMC-8 expression 23-fold, 5 h after seedlings were transferred on MS media supplemented with 30 mm (Fig. 1C). To further investigate a link with oxidative stress and cell death, we analyzed the effect of methyl viologen, an herbicide that induces an apoptotic-like PCD (28Chen S. Dickman M.B. J. Exp. Bot. 2004; 55: 2617-2623Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) and causes the production of superoxide in the chloroplast, which is converted into H2O2. Methyl viologen (MV) was found to induce AtMC8 expression 64-fold, 5 h after seedlings were transferred on MS media supplemented with 25 μm (Fig. 1C). This concentration caused bleaching and cell death of seedlings (not shown). To establish whether the oxidative stress inducing AtMC8 expression originated from the chloroplast, we analyzed the transcript level of AtMC8 in the mutant rcd1-1. RCD1 is proposed to regulate specific stress-responsive genes, and rcd1 is insensitive to ROS produced by the chloroplast (29Ahlfors R. Lang S. Overmyer K. Jaspers P. Brosche M. Tauriainen A.

https://openalex.org/W2043998802,"Thioredoxin-interacting protein (Txnip) has been recently described as a possible link between cellular redox state and metabolism; Txnip binds thioredoxin and inhibits its disulfide reductase activity in vitro, while a naturally occurring strain of Txnip-deficient mice has hyperlipidemia, hypoglycemia, and ketosis exacerbated by fasting. We generated Txnip-null mice to investigate the role of Txnip in glucose homeostasis. Txnip-null mice were hypoglycemic, hypoinsulinemic, and had blunted glucose production following a glucagon challenge, consistent with a central liver glucose-handling defect. Glucose release from isolated Txnip-null hepatocytes was 2-fold lower than wild-type hepatocytes, whereas β-hydroxybutyrate release was increased 2-fold, supporting an intrinsic defect in hepatocyte glucose metabolism. While hepatocyte-specific gene deletion of Txnip did not alter glucose clearance compared with littermate controls, Txnip expression in the liver was required for maintaining normal fasting glycemia and glucose production. In addition, hepatic overexpression of a Txnip transgene in wild-type mice resulted in elevated serum glucose levels and decreased ketone levels. Liver homogenates from Txnip-null mice had no significant differences in the glutathione oxidation state or in the amount of available thioredoxin. However, overexpression of wild-type Txnip in Txnip-null hepatocytes rescued cellular glucose production, whereas overexpression of a C247S mutant Txnip, which does not bind thioredoxin, had no effect. These data demonstrate that Txnip is required for normal glucose homeostasis in the liver. While available thioredoxin is not changed in Txnip-null mice, the effects of Txnip on glucose homeostasis are abolished by a single cysteine mutation that inhibits binding to thioredoxin.

While available thioredoxin is not changed in Txnip-null mice, the effects of Txnip on glucose homeostasis are abolished by a single cysteine mutation that inhibits binding to thioredoxin. Tight regulation of glucose homeostasis is fundamental to all higher life forms, and dysregulated glucose metabolism is a significant medical problem (1Engelgau M.M. Geiss L.S. Saaddine J.B.

Assoc. 2003; 289: 76-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (4547) Google Scholar). The liver has a major role in determining glucose levels through its control of both hepatic glucose uptake and glucose release. During fasting states the liver is particularly important, as it is the primary organ for maintaining blood glucose levels by up-regulating gluconeogenesis and glycogenolysis to increase glucose release (3Cahill Jr., G.F.

These processes are coordinated by hormonal control, primarily through the reciprocal actions of glucagon and insulin, as well as through glucocorticoid and adipokine cues (5Exton J. Park C.

The thiol-disulfide redox state of the cell is emerging as an important regulator of diverse processes, including metabolism (16Evans J.L. Goldfine I.D. Maddux B.A. Grodsky G.M.

A key regulator is thioredoxin, a ubiquitous oxidoreductase found in nearly all life forms. Thioredoxin participates in maintaining a reduced cellular environment through the reversible oxidation-reduction of its two active-site cysteines (20Holmgren A. Bjornstedt M. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 252: 199-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (816) Google Scholar). Although originally described as an antioxidant, thioredoxin associates with several transcription factors and signaling molecules, enabling it to serve as a potential mediator of redox signaling (21Guo Y.

Res. Commun. 2000; 271: 796-800Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). The role of thioredoxin in carbohydrate synthesis in plant biology is well established. Light reduces thioredoxin via ferredoxin, and reduced thioredoxin then activates enzymes involved in the Calvin cycle by reduction of protein disulfides (24Buchanan B.B. Balmer Y. Annu. Rev. Plant Biol. 2005; 56: 187-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (697) Google Scholar). Thioredoxin-interacting protein (Txnip), formerly known as VDUP1 or TBP-2, interacts with thioredoxin at its active-site thiols. Overexpression of Txnip inhibits the reducing activity of thioredoxin, slows cell growth, and promotes apoptosis (23Yamanaka H. Maehira F. Oshiro M. Asato T. Yanagawa Y. Takei H. Nakashima Y.

They demonstrated that a naturally occurring mouse strain with pronounced hyperlipidemia (the HcB-19, or Hyplip1, strain) has a mutation that causes a truncation of Txnip at residue 96 (of 391) (28Bodnar J.S. Chatterjee A. Castellani L.W. Ross D.A. Ohmen J. Cavalcoli J. Wu C. Dains K.M. Catanese J. Chu M. Sheth S.S. Charugundla K. Demant P. West D.B. de Jong P. Lusis A.J. Nat.

An initial report from Txnip-null mice generated by targeted deletion confirmed the importance of Txnip for the metabolic response to the fasting state, these mice die from multiple organ failure after 3 days of fasting. Fasted mice are rescued by a glucose-only diet but not a fat-only diet (31Oka S. Liu W. Masutani H. Hirata H. Shinkai Y. Yamada S. Yoshida T. Nakamura H. Yodoi J. FASEB J. 2006; 20: 121-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), suggesting a defect in either fat utilization or in the generation and release of glucose. A link between thioredoxin redox state and metabolism has important implications, but it is not yet clear whether the Txnip-null phenotype is fully explained by the loss of inhibition of thioredoxin. It is possible that Txnip has other functions besides thioredoxin binding. Txnip has distant sequence homology to the arrestins, intracellular proteins that bind to phosphorylated receptors and then direct further signaling, and/or endocytosis (32Lefkowitz R.J. Shenoy S.K. Science. 2005; 308: 512-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (1425) Google Scholar). In addition to Txnip, mammals have three Txnip-homologous proteins of unknown function, named Arrestin domain containing 2-4 (Arrdc2-4), which do not bind thioredoxin (33Patwari P. Higgins L.J. Chutkow W.A. Yoshioka J. Lee R.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 21884-21891Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the gene encoding Arrdc3 has recently been linked to human obesity in males (34Emilsson V. Thorleifsson G. Sainz J. Walters G. Gulcher J. Lamb J. Schadt E. World International Property Organization. 2005; (WO 2005/111239 A3)Google Scholar). This suggests the hypothesis that the Arrdc family of Txnip-like proteins is a family of metabolic regulators whose functions are not limited to thioredoxin binding (33Patwari P. Higgins L.J. Chutkow W.A. Yoshioka J. Lee R.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 21884-21891Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). We recently reported that mutation of a single Txnip cysteine (Cys-247) abolishes the ability of Txnip to bind thioredoxin and to inhibit thioredoxin activity when overexpressed in 3T3-L1 adipocytes (33Patwari P. Higgins L.J. Chutkow W.A. Yoshioka J. Lee R.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 21884-21891Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). We have now generated total and hepatocyte-specific Txnip gene deletion in mice to assess the functions of Txnip in vivo. We used these mice to explore the role of Txnip in glucose homeostasis and demonstrated that in the absence of Txnip the liver is intrinsically defective in maintaining blood glucose levels through glucose production and release. We then demonstrated that the effects of Txnip on glucose regulation are abolished by a single cysteine mutation that is required for the Txnip-thioredoxin interaction. These results implicate Txnip as a key regulator of hepatic glucose production and global glucose homeostasis. Mouse Txnip Systemic and Liver-specific Deletion—Generation of an exon1 loxP-flanked Txnip locus (Txnipfl/fl) and systemic Txnip gene deletion is described elsewhere (35Yoshioka J. Imahashi K.

Hepatocyte-specific Txnip gene deletion was achieved by breeding Txnipfl/fl mice to a transgenic mouse overexpressing the Cre recombinase under an hepatocyte-restricted Albumin promoter (B6.Cg-Tg(Alb-cre)21Mgn/J, Jackson Labs) (36Postic C. Shiota M. Niswender K.D. Jetton T.L. Chen Y. Moates J.M. Shelton K.D. Lindner J. Cherrington A.D. Magnuson M.A. J. Biol.

Primers used for PCR genotyping were F1-sense, 5′-TTTCGTTTGGGTTTTCAAGC-3′; F2-sense, 5′-CTTCACCCCCCTAGAGTGAT-3′; and R-antisense, 5′-CCCAGAGCACTTTCTTGGAC-3′. Primers for Cre PCR genotyping were: CreF, 5′-GCGGTCTGGCAGTAAAAACTATC-3′; and CreR, 5′-GTGAAACAGCATTGCTGTCACTT-3′. Serum Metabolite, Insulin, and Glucagon Assays—Tail vein blood samples were collected with heparinized capillary tubes and serum was obtained by centrifugation at 5000 × g through a serum separating gel barrier at 4 °C (Statspin, Inc.). Serum triglyceride, non-esterified free fatty acids, cholesterol, and β-hydroxybutyrate levels were assayed spectrophotometrically using commercially available kits (Wako and StanBio Labs). Serum insulin levels were measured by ELISA (Linco and ALPCO) and serum glucagon levels were measured by radioimmunoassay (Linco). Whole blood glucose levels were assayed from tail clipping venous blood samples using an Ascensia Elite XL glucometer (Bayer Co). Glucose, Insulin, and Glucagon Tolerance Tests—Glucose (2 mg/g weight), insulin (0.25 milliunits/g weight), or glucagon (200 ng/g weight) was injected into the peritoneum of fasting mice (18 h fast for glucose tolerance, 4 h for insulin tolerance, and 48 h for glucagon tolerance). Tail vein whole blood glucose levels were assayed at intervals by glucometer, as above. Northern Analysis—Total RNA was isolated from various tissues using the RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen). 10 μg of total RNA was separated by 1% denaturing agarose gel electrophoresis and hybridized with a [α-32P]dCTP-labeled cDNA fragment corresponding to the full-length mouse Txnip coding region. Immunohistochemistry and Immunofluorescence—Tissues were harvested from mice and fixed in ice-cold 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline for 4 h at 4 °C, then transferred to 70% ice-cold ethanol overnight at 4 °C. Fixed tissues were then embedded in paraffin, sectioned onto slides, and rehydrated by standard means. Rehydrated tissue sections were immunostained without antigen-retrieval using primary antibodies to GFP (Rabbit polyclonal, Invitrogen) or insulin (guinea pig polyclonal, Zymed Laboratories Inc.). Immunohistochemistry was performed using the Vectastain ABC kit (Vector Labs) and immunofluorescence was performed using Rhodamine Red-X-AffiniPure secondary antibodies (Jackson Labs). Quantitative Reverse Transcriptase-PCR—Liver total RNA was isolated using the RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen). cDNA was synthesized from 2 μg of total RNA and random hexamers using the TaqMan Reverse Transcription kit (ABI). Real-time PCR was performed in 96-well plates using a 7300 Real-time PCR system (ABI). All reactions were performed in triplicate and verified by melting curve analysis. The relative amount of mRNA in each sample was normalized to 18 S transcript levels. Primer sequences are included in the supplemental “Methods.” Hepatocyte Isolation and Culture—Mouse hepatocytes were isolated by a modified two-step perfusion procedure (37Seglen P.O. Methods Cell Biol. 1976; 13: 29-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (5218) Google Scholar, 38Berry M.N. Grivell A.R. Grivell M.B. Phillips J.W. Cell Biol. Toxicol. 1997; 13: 223-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). In brief, mice were perfused retrograde through the hepatic vein via the inferior vena cava and out the severed portal vein, with the inferior vena cava clamped above the diaphragm. Hepatocyte Perfusion medium and Hepatocyte Collagenase solution (Invitrogen) were maintained at 37 °C and perfused at 9 ml/min for 5 min each. The liver was then excised and gently disrupted to release the cells, which were strained and then washed once in ice-cold Hepatocyte Wash medium (Invitrogen) at 50 × g and once with 27% Percoll in isotonic phosphate-buffered saline (Amersham Biosciences) at 100 × g for 10 min, followed by a final wash with wash medium. Cells were incubated in Williams medium E with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 nm insulin, and 100 nm dexamethasone for 4 h, and afterward maintained in serum-free Hepatozyme-SFM medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 2% Me2SO for 48 h. Fao hepatoma cells, a gift of C. R. Kahn (Joslin Diabetes Center, Boston), were maintained in RPMI 1640 media supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, l-glutamine, and antibiotics. Hepatocyte Glucose Production—Hepatocytes cultured on adsorbed collagen type 1 (BD Biosciences), or Fao hepatoma cells, were stimulated overnight with 250 μm 8-bromo-cAMP and 100 nm dexamethasone (Sigma). The following day, the cells were washed twice with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing no glucose or phenol red, allowed to sit for 30 min in glucose-free media, then cultured in the same media with the addition of 20 mm lactate and 2 mm pyruvate or 20 mm glycerol (Sigma). After 3 h, the culture medium was removed and centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 10 min. The glucose content of the supernatant was measured by a glucose oxidase colorimetric assay (Sigma). Lentiviral Production and Tail Vein Injection—Lentiviral constructs for Txnip and Txnip C247S were made as described previously (33Patwari P. Higgins L.J. Chutkow W.A. Yoshioka J. Lee R.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 21884-21891Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). Viral multiplicity of infection for liver infectivity was estimated based on in vitro primary hepatocyte transduction efficiency: 0.5 ml of undiluted viral stocks supplemented with Polybrene (7.5 μg/ml) was added to 105 primary hepatocytes cultured in 12-well plates, and GFP-positive cells were counted 96 h after transduction. Anesthetized male C57Bl/6 mice, aged 9-12 weeks, were injected with 150 μl of undiluted viral stocks supplemented with Polybrene (5 μg/ml) into the tail vein. Serum analysis or tissue harvesting was performed 7 days after injection. GSSG:GSH Assay—Glutathione levels were assayed spectrophotometrically using a Bioxytech GSH/GSSG-412 kit, with modifications (Oxis International Inc., Foster City, CA). Overnight fasted mouse livers were harvested and immediately homogenized in the presence or absence of 3 mm 1-methyl-2-vinylpyridinium trifluoromethanesulfonate at 4 °C. Uncomplexed glutathione was acidextracted from the homogenates with ice-cold 5% metaphosphoric acid (Sigma) and assayed according to the manufacturer's protocol. Thioredoxin Activity Assay—Total available thioredoxin in mouse liver homogenates was measured by the insulin-disulfide reducing assay, modified from Holmgren and Bjornstedt (20Holmgren A. Bjornstedt M. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 252: 199-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (816) Google Scholar). To increase the sensitivity of the assay to unavailable thioredoxin (through formation of either mixed disulfides at the active site or noncovalent protein complexes), we omitted the incubation at 70 °C and the incubation with dithiothreitol (33Patwari P. Higgins L.J. Chutkow W.A. Yoshioka J. Lee R.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 21884-21891Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). Livers were homogenized in a Tris buffer with 0.5% Triton X-100 and clarified at 16,000 × g. Portions of the fresh clarified homogenate containing 50 μg of total protein were incubated with insulin, rat liver thioredoxin reductase (Sigma), and NADPH for 15 min at 37 °C. 5,5′-Dithiobis(nitrobenzoic acid) in guanidine was then added and the final reduced product was quantified by optical density at 420 nm. Statistical Analysis—All data are presented as mean ± S.E. Statistical analysis was performed with Student's t test. Data were considered statistically significant for p < 0.05. Txnip-null Mice Are Hypoglycemic and Have Marked Fasting Ketosis, but Normal Lipid Levels—We generated mice with conditional gene deletion of Txnip using a Cre-lox strategy for targeted deletion as previously described in detail (35Yoshioka J. Imahashi K. Gabel S.A. Chutkow W.A. Burds A.A. Gannon J. Schulze P.C. MacGillivray C. London R.E. Murphy E. Lee R.T. Circulation Res. 2007; 101: 1328-1338Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Homozygous Txnip-floxed mice (Txnipfl/fl) were crossed with Protamine-Cre mice to generate offspring heterozygous for Txnip deletion, which were bred to homozygosity for use in this study. Northern and Western analysis demonstrated absence of gene expression in various tissues (Fig. 1, A and B). Txnip-null mice were fertile and outwardly normal in appearance and behavior. No significant differences were seen in animal weight compared with wild-type littermate controls (supplemental Fig. S1). Fed male Txnip-null and wild-type littermates, aged 12-18 weeks (Fig. 1C), did not have any significant differences in triglyceride levels, but the Txnip-null mice had 27 ± 7% higher levels of non-esterified fatty acids (p < 0.01) and 21 ± 3% lower blood glucose levels (p < 0.001). The lower blood glucose was exacerbated by fasting: Txnip-null mice had 35 ± 3% less glucose than wild-type littermates after an overnight fast, and 65 ± 4% less after a 48-h fast (p < 0.01 for both comparisons, Fig. 1C). In addition, fasted Txnip-null mice had a striking ketosis with levels 7.1 ± 0.8-fold higher than littermate controls (p < 0.001). A trend toward increased fasting non-esterified fatty acids was also observed (28 ± 11% increase, p = 0.08). The hypoglycemia, ketosis, and mild increase in non-esterified fatty acids exacerbated by fasting are consistent with the phenotypes reported previously for the HcB-19 mouse (29Hui T.Y. Sheth S.S.

Yamada S. Yoshida T. Nakamura H. Yodoi J. FASEB J. 2006; 20: 121-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Txnip-null Mice Have Increased Glucose Clearance and Impaired Response to Glucagon—To investigate the defect in glucose homeostasis in the Txnip-null mice, we first examined the kinetics of serum glucose clearance after an intraperitoneal glucose bolus in overnight fasted mice. The rise in serum glucose levels was significantly decreased for the Txnip-null mice compared with wild-type littermates, in terms of both absolute change and change relative to baseline (Fig. 2A), suggesting an enhanced rate of glucose clearance by peripheral tissues. To determine whether the more rapid glucose clearance was the result of greater insulin-mediated glucose uptake, we next compared the blood glucose levels in response to an intraperitoneal insulin injection. Using a submaximal insulin dose, Txnip-null mice exhibited significantly augmented glucose clearance (Fig. 2B), consistent with enhanced insulin-stimulated glucose disposal by peripheral tissues, enhanced insulin-mediated suppression of hepatic glucose production, or both. To determine whether a liver defect contributed to the increased glucose clearance, mice fasted for 48 h were challenged with an intraperitoneal glucagon injection. Following the injection, serum glucose levels were markedly blunted in the Txnip-null mice (Fig. 2C). This may reflect a primary defect in glycogen metabolism or a failure to replete glycogen stores due to a primary defect in gluconeogenesis. Hyperinsulinemia and a brisk insulin secretory response to glucose are possible hormonal mechanisms that would both augment glucose clearance as well as suppress appropriate hepatic glucose production. However, fed serum insulin levels were depressed by 61 ± 10% (p < 0.01) in the Txnip-null mice compared with wild-type littermates, and by 76 ± 10% (p < 0.05) in the fasting state (Fig. 2D), excluding this possibility. Hypoinsulinemia in our Txnip-null model is a departure from the prior observations of the HcB-19 mice and the global knock out reported by Oka et al. (31Oka S. Liu W. Masutani H. Hirata H. Shinkai Y. Yamada S. Yoshida T. Nakamura H. Yodoi J. FASEB J. 2006; 20: 121-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), which described either a trend toward higher serum insulin levels or frank hyperinsulinemia when compared with control mice (29Hui T.Y.

In this paper, we studied the effect of 5LO-targeted gene disruption on the amyloid phenotype of a transgenic mouse model of AD, the Tg2576. Amyloid-beta (Abeta) deposition in the brains of Tg2576 mice lacking 5LO was reduced by 64-80% compared with Tg2576 controls. This reduction was associated with a similar significant decrease in Abeta levels measured by sandwich ELISA. Absence of 5LO did not induce any significant change in amyloid-beta precursor protein (APP) levels and processing, or Abeta catabolic pathways. Furthermore, in vitro studies showed that 5LO activation or 5LO metabolites increase, whereas 5LO inhibition decreases, Abeta formation, secondary to correspondent changes in gamma-secretase activity. These data establish for the first time a novel functional role for 5LO in the pathogenesis of AD-like amyloidosis, thereby modulating gamma-secretase activity. Our work suggests that pharmacological inhibition of 5LO could provide a novel therapeutic tool for AD."

In the present study we employed in vivo and cell culture models to elucidate the role of Notch signaling in wound healing. The healing of full-thickness dermal wounds was significantly delayed in Notch antisense transgenic mice and in normal mice treated with γ-secretase inhibitors that block proteolytic cleavage and activation of Notch. In contrast, mice treated with a Notch ligand Jagged peptide showed significantly enhanced wound healing compared to controls. Activation or inhibition of Notch signaling altered the behaviors of cultured vascular endothelial cells, keratinocytes and fibroblasts in a scratch wound healing model in ways consistent with roles for Notch signaling in wound healing functions all three cell types. These results suggest that Notch signaling plays important roles in wound healing and tissue repair, and that targeting the Notch pathway might provide a novel strategy for treatment of wounds and for modulation of angiogenesis in other pathological conditions."

A critical requirement for these applications is the generation of a stable linkage between the solid support and the immobilized, but still functional, protein.Solid supports including crosslinked polymer beads, beaded agarose, and planar glass surfaces, were modified to present an oligoglycine motif to solution. A range of proteins were ligated to the various surfaces using the Sortase A enzyme of S. aureus. Reactions were carried out in aqueous buffer conditions at room temperature for times between one and twelve hours.The Sortase A transpeptidase of S. aureus provides a general, robust, and gentle approach to the selective covalent immobilization of proteins on three very different solid supports. The proteins remain functional and accessible to solution. Sortase mediated ligation is therefore a straightforward methodology for the preparation of solid supported enzymes and bead based assays, as well as the modification of planar surfaces for microanalytical devices and protein arrays."
https://openalex.org/W1987759199,"The catalytic subunits of class I PI3Ks comprise four isoforms: p110α, p110β, p110δ and p110γ. Cancer-specific gain-of-function mutations in p110α have been identified in various malignancies. Cancer-specific mutations in the non-α isoforms of class I PI3K have not yet been identified, however overexpression of either wild-type p110β, p110γ or p110δ is sufficient to induce cellular transformation in chicken embryo fibroblasts. The mechanism whereby these non-α isoforms of class I mediate oncogenic signals is unknown. Here we show that potently transforming class I isoforms signal via Akt/mTOR, inhibit GSK3β and cause degradation of FoxO1. A functional Erk pathway is required for p110γ and p110β transformation but not for transformation by p110δ or the H1047R mutant of p110α. Transformation and signaling by p110γ and p110β are sensitive to loss of interaction with Ras, which acts as a membrane anchor. Mutations in the C2 domain of p110δ reduce transformation, most likely by interfering with membrane association. Several small molecule inhibitors potently and specifically inhibit the oncogenic signaling and transformation of each of the class I PI3K, and, when used in combination with MEK inhibitors, can additively reduce the transformation induced by p110β and p110γ."
https://openalex.org/W1975206919,"The ubiquitously expressed major Ras isoforms: H-, K- and N-Ras, are highly conserved, yet exhibit different biological outputs. We have compared the relative efficiencies with which epidermal or hepatocyte growth factor activates Ras isoforms and the requirement for specific isoforms in the activation of downstream pathways. We find that the relative coupling efficiencies to each Ras isoform are conserved between stimuli. Furthermore, in both cases, inhibition of receptor endocytosis led to reduced N- and H-Ras activation, but K-Ras was unaffected. Acute knockdown of each isoform with siRNA allows endogenous Ras isoform function and abundance to be probed. This revealed that there is significant variation in the contribution of individual isoforms to total Ras across a panel of cancer cell lines although typically K⩾N≫H. Intriguingly, cancer cell lines where a significant fraction of endogenous Ras is oncogenically mutated showed attenuated activation of canonical Ras effector pathways. We profiled the contribution of each Ras isoform to the total Ras pool allowing interpretation of the effect of isoform-specific knockdown on signalling outcomes. In contrast to previous studies indicating preferential coupling of isoforms to Raf and PtdIns-3-kinase pathways, we find that endogenous Ras isoforms show no specific coupling to these major Ras pathways."

Kinase-mediated phosphoryl transfer is a key component of many signaling pathways. Tight control of signaling requires regulation of kinase activity, which is influenced by allosteric transitions (1Lieser S.A. Shaffer J. Adams J.A. J. Biol.

The LID motion is an example of allosteric regulation that results from a shift in the populations of available substates. The intrinsic motion of the NMP domain does not correlate with domain closure. Thus, the NMP domain is an example of a ligand-induced conformational change. Additionally, the high strain in the NMP domain supports the claim that the NMP domain likely partially unfolds (cracks) during conformational transitions. Upon closure of the LID domain, the LID-NMP interface provides enthalpic interactions that stabilize the closed NMP domain. This provides a driving force for NMP closure and leads to phosphoryl transfer. Intrinsic structural fluctuations then drive the LID domain open, which destabilizes the LID-NMP interface and drives the NMP domain open. This mechanism, which involves correlated motion of the domains, reduces misligation and may have evolved to increase the efficiency of AKE.

To characterize the energetics of the conformational change transition states of AKE, we simulated it using a coarse-grained, structure-based potential that utilizes information from the open and closed forms. Each residue was represented by a bead located at the Cα position. Backbone geometry was maintained through harmonic potentials for adjacent bond distances and bond angles and through cosine functions for dihedrals, with minimum values corresponding to the open conformation (PDB code 4AKE (4Mueller C.W. Schlauderer G.J. Reinstein J. Schulz G.E. Structure (Camb.). 1996; 4: 147-156Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar)). Non-local contacts were determined using contact of structural units analysis (33Sobolev V. Wade R. Vried G. Edelman M. Proteins Struct. Funct.

In addition to the open contacts, contacts unique to the closed structure (PDB code 1AKE (5Mueller C.W. Schulz G.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 224: 159-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar)) were included to induce domain closure. The closed contacts provide an implicit representation of the ligand. A complete description of the potential can be found elsewhere (8Whitford P.C. Miyashita O. Levy Y. Onuchic J.N. J. Mol. Biol. 2007; 366: 1661-1671Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). For this study, we reduced the interaction strength of all contacts formed with helix 4α by 30%. Reducing these interaction strengths noticeably alters the population of the NMP-closed-LID-open conformation, which illustrates the significant effect helix 4α has on the catalytic dynamics. Nonlinear Normal Mode Analysis—Normal modes are known to capture the dynamics of large conformational changes in many proteins (6Miyashita O. Onuchic J.N. Wolynes P.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 12570-12575Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar, 7Miyashita O. Wolynes P.G. Onuchic J.N. J. Phys. Chem.

In this study we used a nonlinear normal mode analysis to describe the intrinsic contributions a given structure provides to each conformational rearrangement. This approach, first introduced by Miyashita et al. (6Miyashita O. Onuchic J.N. Wolynes P.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 12570-12575Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar, 7Miyashita O. Wolynes P.G. Onuchic J.N. J. Phys. Chem. B. 2005; 109: 1959-1969Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), provides a better representation of global motion far from equilibrium by minimizing steric and energetic contradictions observed by standard linear normal mode analysis. Initially, normal modes ⇀Ni for the open form of AKE (PDB code 4AKE) were determined using a Tirion potential (34Tirion M.M. Phys. Rev. Lett. 1996; 77: 1905-1908Crossref PubMed Scopus (1350) Google Scholar), where all atom pairs within 5 Å are connected by harmonic springs. AKE was translated along each mode a distance of dRi = Λ⇀d·⇀Ni Bi/Bt, where Bi/Bt is the fraction of the total B-factor contributed by mode i and Λ is a chosen length scale (=0.05 Å). ⇀d is the spatial displacement of atoms between the current structure and the final structure (closed structure, PDB code 1AKE) after root mean squared fitting using the McLachlan algorithm (35McLachlan A.D. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1982; 38: 871-873Crossref Scopus (336) Google Scholar) in the ProFit software package (because ⇀d and root mean squared fitting require two structures with an identical number of atoms and the open structure does not have a ligand, ligands were not explicitly represented). Thus, the intrinsic overlap with a conformational change is as follows. 1ΛmodesΣidRi At every step, a new Tirion potential was determined based on the translated structure, and the nonlinear normal mode analysis was repeated. This process was repeated until the closed conformation was reached. The same process was used for the opening of AKE and for individual domain rearrangements. This method is similar to a previously applied method (5Mueller C.W. Schulz G.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 224: 159-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar, 6Miyashita O. Onuchic J.N. Wolynes P.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 12570-12575Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar), except that the Bi/Bt term in dRi was not included in previous studies. Although the Bi/Bt term does not qualitatively alter the dynamics, it modifies overlap to be the percent of intrinsic motion a structure has in the direction of a given conformational transition. The strain energy was determined by calculating the total potential energy as defined by the Tirion potential for the initial structure. As discussed by Miyashita et al. (6Miyashita O. Onuchic J.N. Wolynes P.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 12570-12575Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar, 7Miyashita O. Wolynes P.G. Onuchic J.N. J. Phys. Chem. B. 2005; 109: 1959-1969Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), if too much local strain is accumulated then cracking (local unfolding) may reduce the strain during conformational transitions. Reaction Coordinates—Allosteric conformational changes involve major domain motion. We measured this motion using the spatial distance between the center of masses of the domains. RCMLID-CORE and RCMNMP-CORE are the distances between the center of mass of the LID and the CORE domains and the distance between the center of mass of the NMP and the CORE domains, respectively. RCMLID-CORE is 30.1 and 21.0 Å in the open and closed forms, respectively, whereas RCMNMP-CORE is 22.0 and 18.4 Å in the open and closed forms, respectively. The LID domain is defined as residues 118-160, the NMP domain as residues 30-67, and the CORE domain as residues 1-29, 68-117, and 161-214. Intrinsic Motion in the LID Domain of AKE Contributes Significantly to Allosteric Motion—The LID and NMP domains of AKE rearrange relative to the CORE domain during catalysis (Fig. 1). To determine the order of domain motion, closing and opening trajectories were constructed using recursive nonlinear normal mode analysis (see “Materials and Methods”). At every step of this recursive procedure, the domains were translated along each mode by an amount proportional to the mode's overlap with the conformational transition. This process filters for high B-factor-contributing and high conformational overlap modes. Because B-factors are a measure of atom mobility within a protein, this method not only determines a likely pathway but also provides a quantitative measure for the intrinsic (ligand-free) propensity of the protein to undergo a given conformational rearrangement. Fig. 2 shows the trajectories as functions of RCMLID-CORE and RCMNMP-CORE, the distances between the center of masses of the LID and CORE domains and of the NMP and CORE domains. These trajectories indicate that LID domain motion precedes NMP domain motion during both the opening and closing processes. There are two possible explanations for this observed sequential motion. 1) The open (closed) protein has the intrinsic ability to close (open) the LID domain and not the NMP domain. Once the LID domain closes (opens), the dynamics of the NMP domain are altered such that the intrinsic fluctuations in the LID-closed (open) state favor NMP closure (opening). 2) There is an intrinsic ability to close (open) the LID domain and not the NMP domain. After LID closure (opening), the method employed merely forces the NMP domain to close (open). The LID-NMP Interface Facilitates Communication between LID and NMP—To determine the reason for the observed sequential motion, trajectories were constructed for individual domain rearrangements (Fig. 3). LID domain motion has a higher intrinsic overlap and lower strain associated with its motion than does NMP motion. When both domains are open or closed, there are lower barriers associated with LID motion than NMP motion. Also, a significant increase (Fig. 3, ⋆ versus ⋆⋆) in the slope of the strain associated with NMP opening is observed upon the LID-NMP interface formation. The combination of a reduced intrinsic overlap and the higher energetic barriers associated with NMP motion suggests that NMP motion is more dependent on enthalpic contributions, such as ligand binding and LID-NMP interface formation. Additionally, the low intrinsic overlap suggests the NMP domain may enter a disordered (locally unfolded) state during conformational transitions. This agrees with structure-based simulations of the open form of AKE that have shown the closed LID domain is more easily accessible than the closed NMP state (see Fig. 4a of Ref. 8Whitford P.C. Miyashita O. Levy Y. Onuchic J.N. J. Mol. Biol. 2007; 366: 1661-1671Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar) and that local unfolding is observed in the NMP domain (see Fig. 5 of Ref. 8Whitford P.C. Miyashita O. Levy Y. Onuchic J.N. J. Mol. Biol. 2007; 366: 1661-1671Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). Additionally, because the LID domain has a propensity to close and the NMP domain does not, stabilizing interactions must be available to close the NMP domain. LID Domain Binding of ATP Assists NMP Closure—Using a simplified structure-based potential (see “Materials and Methods”) and MD simulations, the free energy surface of the conformational rearrangements in AKE was calculated (Fig. 2). 5A discrepancy exists between the normal mode trajectories and the locations of the free energy minima because the MD landscape includes entropic contributions. This model suggests strong coupling between NMP and LID motion in agreement with the nonlinear normal model trajectories. Using the transition state ensembles for each domain's motion, we can calculate functional Phi values ΦFunc, which are analogous to protein-folding Φ values. Protein-folding Φ values measure the free energy contribution to the folding transition state relative to the native state (36Fersht A. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1994; 4: 79-84Crossref Scopus (11) Google Scholar) for a given residue. Because proteins tend to be minimally frustrated, folding results from the balance between the entropy of the unfolded state and native enthalpic interactions. Thus, Φ values measure the amount a given residue drives the folding process. Because the entropy of the various conformations of an allosteric protein may be comparable, enthalpic contributions may play a large role in both the forward and reverse conformational transitions. Thus, high ΦFunc values show a given transition is dominated by enthalpic interactions, and low ΦFunc values show intrinsic structural fluctuations dominate the transition. Therefore, one can determine whether a given residue with a high ΦFunc stabilizes the forward or the backward reaction. Larger ΦFunc values for the NMP domain suggest that energetics is more important for NMP motion than for LID motion. ΦFunc values for residues at the LID-NMP interface are large for the NMP transition state but nearly zero for the LID transition state. Therefore, not only is NMP motion highly dependent on enthalpic interactions, but also a significant number of these interactions are made accessible though closure of the LID domain. This suggests that NMP motion is strongly influenced by the state of the LID domain (open/closed) as well as by AMP binding to its binding site. Thus, both nonlinear normal mode analysis and MD simulations suggest that intrinsic fluctuations are not the main contributors to the NMP transition. Domain Dynamics Can Be Controlled by Mutating the LID-NMP Interface and Helix 4α—To test the importance of the LID-NMP interface on NMP domain dynamics, nonlinear normal mode analysis (NMA) was performed with all LID-NMP interface interactions removed (Fig. 2). As expected, the LID domain no longer opens prior to NMP opening. 6The closing trajectories were not repeated without LID-NMP interactions, as these interactions are not formed in the open conformation. Additionally, if the LID-NMP interactions are not included in our MD simulations, the population of the NMP closed state is largely reduced. Because the interface plays a large role in stabilizing the closed NMP domain and the entropy of the open and closed states is approximately the same (data not shown), enthalpic contributions must stabilize the open form. Helix 4α in the NMP domain fulfils this role. We repeated our previous simulations (8Whitford P.C. Miyashita O. Levy Y. Onuchic J.N. J. Mol. Biol. 2007; 366: 1661-1671Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar) using varying interaction strengths for native contacts made with helix 4α (Fig. 2). By reducing the strength of these interactions in simulations we are able to alter the domain dynamics such that NMP closure followed by LID closure was as probable as LID closure followed by NMP closure. Additionally, by removing the LID-NMP interactions in our NMA we changed the opening dynamics such that NMP opening precedes LID opening (Fig. 2). These results illustrate the dramatic effects that the LID-NMP interface and helix 4α have on the catalytic dynamics of AKE. Catalytic Cycle Explains the 1:1:1 Relationship among NMP Motion, LID Motion, and Substrate Turnover—Although the NMP and the LID domains are allowed to move independently (37Schlauderer G.J. Proba K. Schulz G.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 256: 223-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 38Diederichs K. Schulz G.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 217: 541-549Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar), their conformational transition rates are equal (2Wolf-Watz M. Thai V. Henzler-Wildman K. Hadjipavou G. Eisenmesser E.Z. Kern D. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2004; 11: 945-949Crossref Scopus (402) Google Scholar). Despite evidence that substrate turnover and domain motion are correlated, the details of the mechanism are still unknown. The data presented in this manuscript suggest a catalytic cycle in which there is time-ordered and sequential domain motion (Fig. 4), i.e. LID domain motion precedes NMP motion. Assuming fast phosphoryl transfer, independent domain motion, correct ligand binding, and conformational exchange rates of kLID and kNMP, the substrate turnover rate would be kP = 2/((1/kLID) + (1/kNMP)). This rate is less than kLID and kNMP unless kLID = kNMP. Having independent domain motion that coincidentally has the exact same exchange rate is unlikely. Thus, an alternate explanation for kP = kLID = kNMP is that domain rearrangement is correlated, where the closure (opening) of one domain signals the rapid closure (opening) of the second domain. Energetic and structural considerations from simplified simulations and nonlinear normal mode analysis suggest LID motion signals NMP motion in the following catalytic mechanism. 1) AKE is in the unligated open conformation (Fig. 4a). 2) The LID domain closes and ATP binds (Fig. 4b). 3) LID closure enables AMP to bind concomitantly with NMP domain closure (Fig. 4c.1). 4) Phosphoryl transfer occurs, resulting in two bound ADPs (Fig. 4c.2). 5) ADP is released from the ATP site and the LID domain opens (Fig. 4d). 6) Opening of the LID domain signals the NMP domain to open and release the second ADP (Fig. 4a). Catalytic Cycle Prevents Misligation—The proposed closing mechanism ensures that each conformational rearrangement contributes to the turnover of a substrate by preventing nonproductive substrate binding. Several structural features of AKE are consistent with the proposed mechanism. 1) The LIDATPC-NMPAMPC complex is the only product-forming state. 7The following notations were used: LIDYX = LID domain in state X (O = open, C = closed) with Y (ATP, ADP, AMP, or 0 = no ligand) bound to the LID-CORE pocket; and NMPYX = NMP domain in state X (O = open, C = closed) with Y (ATP, ADP, AMP) bound to the NMP-CORE pocket. 2) The ATP binding site (LID-CORE pocket) can accommodate ATP, ADP, and AMP (in order of decreasing affinity). 3) The AMP binding site (NMP-CORE pocket) is only known to accommodate ADP and AMP. 8Because of communication between domains and AMP binding of the ATP site, binding affinities for AMP may be difficult to determine exactly. 4) When in the LIDATPC-NMPOO state, the AMP site can only accommodate AMP. During step 1, the binding affinities at the ATP site discriminate ATP over AMP by 3 kcal/mol (17Sanders C.R. Tian G. Tsai M.D. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 9028-9043Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Because the LIDATPC-NMPOO state can only accommodate an AMP, 9Because Reaction 1 is reversible, LIDADPC-NMPADPC can result in a product, although in this manuscript we assume steady-state conditions for the forward reaction. proper ligation in AKE would be limited by the ability of the ATP site to discriminate between AMP and ATP. If the alternate closing mechanism was common (LIDOO-NMPAMPC followed by LIDATPC-NMPAMPC), AKE would have more opportunities to form non-product-forming (inhibited) complexes. In the LIDOO-NMPAMPC state the NMP domain is closed. NMP domain closure grants the LID domain access to the LID-NMP interface interactions. These interactions could reduce discrimination between the LIDATPC-NMPAMPC and LIDAMPC-NMPAMPC states by perturbing the closing dynamics of the LID domain. In addition, the LID-NMP interface may provide enough stability to the closed LID domain so that the LID may temporarily close without a ligand. If an ATP-free, LID-closed state is formed, the LID domain would have to open prior to substrate binding and turnover. Thus, these nonfunctional states would increase domain motion frequency without yielding product. Similar structural/functional arguments support the proposed opening process (steps 5 and 6). In Fig. 4, the LID-bound ADP is released first (LID opening), resulting in the LIDOO-NMPADPC state. Upon LID opening the interface between the NMP domain and the LID domain is lost, which destabilizes the closed NMP state. In addition to this destabilization, the intrinsic fluctuations of NMP increase in the direction of domain opening (Fig. 3). The combination of NMP domain destabilization, increased motion in the opening direction, and the chemical potential driving ADP out of the NMP-CORE pocket likely signal the NMP domain to open. These contributions ensure rapid release of the second ADP, allowing NMP to open without the LIDAMPC-NMPADPC state forming. Strain energy considerations from molecular dynamics simulations (8Whitford P.C. Miyashita O. Levy Y. Onuchic J.N. J. Mol. Biol. 2007; 366: 1661-1671Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar) and NMA suggest the alternate opening mechanism, namely NMP opening followed by LID opening, would also be more error prone. To see why, consider the two closed domains to be loaded springs that have been pulled from their equilibrium (open) states. MD simulations and NMA suggest there is a larger amount of strain buildup during NMP closure than during LID closure (approximately three times more; see Fig. 3 and Ref. 8Whitford P.C. Miyashita O. Levy Y. Onuchic J.N. J. Mol. Biol. 2007; 366: 1661-1671Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). Assuming one of the domains is open and the other is closed, the smaller mass of the NMP domain and larger effective spring constant (∝ strain) make it open approximately twice as fast as the LID domain. Thus, when the NMP domain opens first there is twice as much time available for AKE to misligate (forming a LIDATPC-NMPADPC complex) than if the LID opens first (forming a LIDADPC-NMPAMPC complex). Predictions for the AKE Catalytic Cycle—As described above, helix 4α and LID-NMP interface appear to play large roles in the catalytic activity of AKE. To probe these effects in experiments, activity assays of different mutants can be performed. Mutations that provide strong interactions between helix 4α and nearby residues may either maintain wild-type efficiency (substrate turnover/domain rearrangement ≈ 1) or result in NMP domain motion becoming extremely rate-limiting. In the latter case, the NMP domain will undergo a single transition per substrate turnover, even though the LID domain undergoes many closing/opening transitions. On the other hand, mutations that destabilize helix 4α and the LID-NMP interface would allow NMP to close more easily, diminish the role of the LID-NMP interface, and decouple the motion of the two domains. This decoupling would effectively poison the protein and substrate turnover would drop to 2/((1/kLID) + (1/kNMP)), assuming no misligation events. Allosteric Motion May Be Decomposed into Intrinsic and Ligand-gated Contributions—Allosteric conformational transitions are becoming a prevalent theme in cellular signaling, occurring in a wide range of systems, including kinases, G-proteins, and ion channels. In the classical view of allostery, conformational changes occur between static structures and are induced by ligand binding. Allosteric changes of this type can be considered “ligand-gated” or “extrinsic” motion. In contrast, the current understanding of allostery assumes that protein structures are not static, three-dimensional structures but are ensembles of conformations where ligands change the balance of pre-existing substates. In this perspective, the protein is constantly interconverting between multiple conformations, and the conformational change could be considered “intrinsic.” In this manuscript we have included the intrinsic and extrinsic descriptions in a single statistical picture and provided two structure-based methods that quantitatively distinguish between them. Using AKE as a test protein, we have demonstrated that the conformational rearrangement of the LID domain can be captured by intrinsic motion and that the motion of the NMP domain is likely more dependent on ligands. As we target allosteric changes in therapeutics, this type of classification will allow for more sophisticated drug design.9 We thank Professor Peter Wolynes and Jeffrey Noel for valuable discussions, especially regarding NMA, and Patricia Jennings for discussion about enzymatic kinetics."

Sorgoleone likely accounts for much of the allelopathy of Sorghum spp., typically representing the predominant constituent of Sorghum bicolor root exudates. Previous and ongoing studies suggest that the biosynthetic pathway for this plant growth inhibitor occurs in root hair cells, involving a polyketide synthase activity that utilizes an atypical 16:3 fatty acyl-CoA starter unit, resulting in the formation of a pentadecatrienyl resorcinol intermediate. Subsequent modifications of this resorcinolic intermediate are likely to be mediated by S-adenosylmethionine-dependent O-methyltransferases and dihydroxylation by cytochrome P450 monooxygenases, although the precise sequence of reactions has not been determined previously. Analyses performed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry with sorghum root extracts identified a 3-methyl ether derivative of the likely pentadecatrienyl resorcinol intermediate, indicating that dihydroxylation of the resorcinol ring is preceded by O-methylation at the 3′-position by a novel 5-n-alk(en)ylresorcinol-utilizing O-methyltransferase activity. An expressed sequence tag data set consisting of 5,468 sequences selected at random from an S. bicolor root hair-specific cDNA library was generated to identify candidate sequences potentially encoding enzymes involved in the sorgoleone biosynthetic pathway. Quantitative real time reverse transcription-PCR and recombinant enzyme studies with putative O-methyltransferase sequences obtained from the expressed sequence tag data set have led to the identification of a novel O-methyltransferase highly and predominantly expressed in root hairs (designated SbOMT3), which preferentially utilizes alk(en)ylresorcinols among a panel of benzene-derivative substrates tested.

Allelopathy, the chemical inhibition of one plant species by another, represents a form of chemical warfare between neighboring plants competing for limited light, water, and nutrient resources (1Inderjit Duke S.O.

Allelopathic interactions have been proposed to have profound effects on the evolution of plant communities through the loss of susceptible species via chemical interference, and by imposing selective pressure favoring individuals resistant to inhibition from a given allelochemical (2Bais H.P.

The remaining exudate consists largely of sorgoleone congeners differing in the length or degree of saturation of the aliphatic side chain and in the substitution pattern of the quinone ring (11Kagan I.A.

The fact that sorgoleone acts as a potent broad-spectrum inhibitor active against many agronomically important monocot and dicot weed species, exhibits a long half-life in soil, and appears to affect multiple cellular targets (e.g. 8–10, 13–17) may make it promising for development as a natural product alternative to synthetic herbicides (18Bertin C.

Sorgoleone biosynthesis likely occurs exclusively in root hairs, which appear as cytoplasmically dense cells in sorghum, containing large osmiophilic globules deposited between the plasmalemma and cell wall, presumably associated with sorgoleone rhizosecretion (10Czarnota M.A. Paul R.N.

Labeling studies have demonstrated that the biosynthesis of sorgoleone involves the convergence of the fatty acid and polyketide pathways (21Fate G.D. Lynn D.G. J. Am. Chem.

Upon exudation, the less stable hydroquinone rapidly oxidizes to the highly phytotoxic benzoquinone form, which can persist in soil for extended periods (9Einhellig F.A. Souza I.F. J. Chem. Ecol. 1992; 18: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar, 10Czarnota M.A. Paul R.N. Dayan F.E. Nimbal C.I. Weston L.A. Weed Technol. 2001; 15: 813-825Crossref Google Scholar, 23Netzly D.M. Riopel J.L. Ejeta G. Butler L.G. Weed Sci. 1988; 36: 441-446Crossref Google Scholar). In addition, recent studies have shown that sorgoleone biosynthesis occurs constitutively during early seedling establishment, and its accumulation is apparently distinct from that of phytoalexins as levels were not observed to increase following various elicitor treatments (24Dayan F.E.

The specific sequence of biosynthetic reactions leading to the formation of dihydrosorgoleone, starting from the proposed 5-pentadecatrienyl resorcinol intermediate (Fig. 1), has not been determined previously. Moreover, despite the ecological and agronomic importance of this family of allelochemicals, a paucity of information exists concerning the genes and corresponding enzymes participating in their biosynthesis. In this study, we have identified a 3-methyl ether derivative of the previously characterized 5-pentadecatrienyl resorcinol intermediate by GC-MS analysis of sorghum root extracts, indicating that dihydroxylation of the resorcinol ring is preceded by O-methylation at the 3′-position by a novel 5-n-alk(en)ylresorcinol-utilizing O-methyltransferase activity. To identify candidate O-methyltransferase sequences, as well as candidates representing other steps in the biosynthetic pathway, an annotated EST data set consisting of 5,468 quality 5′-sequences was generated from an S. bicolor root hair-specific cDNA library. Follow-up real time RT-PCR and recombinant enzyme studies with putative O-methyltransferase sequences obtained from this library have led to the identification of a root hair-specific O-methyltransferase (designated SbOMT3) utilizing alkylresorcinolic substrates, proposed to be involved in the biosynthesis of sorgoleone. Furthermore, the annotated root hair-specific data set we have generated directly complements the existing public sorghum EST sequences, and expands our understanding of the transcriptome of a highly specialized and unique cell type. Plant Material and Growth ConditionsSeeds of S. bicolor genotype BTx623 were purchased from Crosbyton Seed Co. (Crosbyton, TX), and SX-17 sorghum-Sudangrass hybrid seeds (S. bicolor × sudanense) were purchased from Dekalb Genetics (Dekalb, IL). SX-17 was used for sorgoleone content comparisons with BTx623; all other experiments described in this work involved only BTx623. Root tissues used for sorgoleone content determinations, analysis of C15:3 resorcinols, root hair preparations, and whole root systems used for real time RT-PCR experiments were obtained from 5- or 8-day-old dark-grown seedlings grown under soil-free conditions using a capillary mat system devised by Czarnota and co-workers (10Czarnota M.A. Paul R.N. Dayan F.E. Nimbal C.I. Weston L.A. Weed Technol. 2001; 15: 813-825Crossref Google Scholar). Immature leaves and shoot apices used for real time RT-PCR experiments were isolated from seedlings maintained in a growth chamber at 28 °C for 8 days in standard (∼20 × 40 cm) nursery flats using Premier Pro Mix PGX potting media (Hummert International, Earth City, MO) under a combination of cool-white fluorescent and incandescent lighting at an intensity of ∼400 μmol m-2 s-1 and a 16-h photoperiod. Developing panicles, mature leaves, and culm (stem) tissues used for real time RT-PCR experiments were isolated from 10-week-old greenhouse-grown plants. At the time of harvest, panicles were partially exerted from flag leaf sheaths, just prior to anthesis. All harvested plant material was directly flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80 °C prior to analysis, with the exception of material used for sorgoleone content determinations, which involved fresh tissue extractions. Sorgoleone Content DeterminationsRoot systems from 5-day-old seedlings were weighed, immersed in chloroform, and agitated for 30 s. Extracts were filtered through Whatman 110-mm number 1 filter disks (Whatman Inc., Florham Park, NJ) to remove debris, concentrated in vacuo at 30 °C using a rotary evaporator (Büchi Rotovapor, Brinkmann Instruments), and dried to completion under nitrogen gas, then weighed on an analytical balance. Dried extracts were then re-dissolved in acetonitrile (1.0 mg sample per ml of acetonitrile) and analyzed by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) using a Hewlett-Packard 1050 HPLC System (Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto, CA) equipped with an Alltech EPS C18 column (100 Å, 3 μm, 150-mm length, 4.5-mm internal diameter; Alltech Associates Inc., Deerfield, IL). The sample was eluted as follows (solvent A is 2.5% acetic acid in water; solvent B is acetonitrile): 0–15-min 45% A, 55% B isocratic; 15–22-min linear gradient from 55 to 100% B; 22–25-min 100% B; 25–26-min 100 to 55% B; 26–30-min 45% A/55% B isocratic. A flow rate of 2 ml/min was used, and the sample injection volume was 20 μl. The peak corresponding to sorgoleone was monitored at 280 nm. Quantitation was based on a calibration curve using purified sorgoleone as an external standard. GC-MS Analysis of C15:3 ResorcinolsRoot systems from 8-day-old seedlings were first immersed in chloroform with agitation for 30 s to remove sorgoleone and then lyophilized. Lyophilized material was pulverized using a mortar and pestle, followed by homogenization in methanol (∼10 g per 50 ml) for 1 min at 25,000 rpm. Homogenates were then filtered through Whatman number 1 filter disks, then evaporated using a rotary evaporator (Büchi Rotovapor, Brinkmann Instruments) at 30 °C. Residues were then re-dissolved in methanol and transferred to GC vials. GC-MS analysis was performed with a JEOL GCMate II System (JEOL USA Inc., Peabody, MA) using a J & W DB-5 capillary column (0.25-mm internal diameter, 0.25-μm film thickness, 30-m length; Agilent Technologies, Foster City, CA). The GC temperature program was initially set to 110 °C, raised to 300 °C at a rate of 6 °C/min, and then held at this temperature for 2.3 min. Ultra-high purity helium was used as carrier at a flow rate of 1.0 ml/min. The inlet (splitless), GC interface, and ion chamber temperatures were 250, 250, and 230 °C, respectively. The sample injection volume used was 2.0 μl. The mass spectrum of the peak at 21.8 min (Fig. 2, B and C) showed fragment ions m/z 314 [M+], 313 [M+ - H], 269 [313+ - CH=CH2, -OH], 255 [269+ - CH2], 241 [255+ - CH2], 227 [241+ - CH2], 213 [227+ - CH2], 199 [213+ - CH2], 187 [313+ - CH(CH2CH=CH)2H, - 2O], 171 [185+ - CH2], 159 [314+ - (CH2CH=CH)3H, -2OH], 143 [314+ - (CH2)2(CH2CH = CH)3H, -2H2O], 131 [159+ - 2CH2], 129 [143+ - CH2], and 117 [131+ - CH2] supporting the identification of the 5-(8′,11′,14′)-pentadecatrienyl resorcinol intermediate. Similarly, the mass spectrum of the peak at 18.3 min (Fig. 2C) showed fragment ions m/z 328 [M+], 313 [M+ - CH3], 285 [M+ - H - CH=CH2, -OH], 269 [M+ - CH2CH=CH2, -H2O], 243 [269+ - CH=CH], 229 [243+ - CH2], 201 [M+ - 2H - (CH2CH=CH)2H, -OH, -OCH3], 187 [201+ - CH2], 171 [M+ - H, -(CH=CHCH2)2CH=CH2, -H2O, -OCH3], 159 [M+ - (CH2CH=CH)3H, -OH, -OCH3], 145 [159+ - CH2], 132 [145+ - CH], 129 [171+ - (CH2)3], and 117 [159+ - (CH2)3], supporting the identification of the 5-(8′,11′,14′)-pentadecatrienyl resorcinol-3-methyl ether intermediate. cDNA Library ConstructionRoot hairs were isolated from dark-grown 8-day-old BTX623 seedling root systems using the method devised by Bucher et al. (25Bucher M. Schroeer B. Willmitzer L. Riesmeier J.W. Plant Mol. Biol. 1997; 35: 497-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), involving immersion in liquid nitrogen with gentle stirring, followed by filtration through a 250-μm aluminum mesh to remove root system debris. Purity of the root hair preparations was assessed by bright field microscopy, and only highly enriched preparations were retained for subsequent cDNA library construction. Root hair preparations were stored at -80 °C prior to RNA extraction. Total RNAs were isolated from root hairs using the TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) per the manufacturer's instructions, with an additional homogenization step of 30 s at 25,000 rpm using a hand-held homogenizer. RNA purity was determined spectrophotometrically, and integrity was assessed by agarose gel electrophoresis. Poly(A)+ mRNA was prepared from root hair total RNA using an Oligotex mRNA Midi Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA), and ∼1.5 μg was used for construction of a directional cDNA library with the Uni-Zap XR cDNA library construction kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA), per the manufacturer's instructions. A primary library of ∼3 × 106 plaque-forming units was obtained. To obtain an estimate of average insert size, 36 randomly selected plaques from a primary library plating were sampled from NZY plates using a sterile 1.0-ml pipette tip, then transferred into culture tubes containing 1.0 ml of SM buffer, and allowed to elute overnight at 4 °C with shaking. Phage eluates (2.5 μl) were then used as templates in 50-μl PCRs containing T3- and T7-specific PCR primers (Stratagene) using an Expand High Fidelity PCR kit (Roche Diagnostics) per the manufacturer's instructions. After an initial denaturation step of 94 °C for 5 min, a thermal profile of 94 °C for 30 s, then 48 °C for 1 min 30 s, followed by 72 °C for 2 min for 35 cycles was used, and aliquots of the reactions were subsequently analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis. By this analysis, the average insert size was estimated to be ∼0.93 kb, ranging between 2.4 and 0.2 kb. EST Sequencing and Data AnalysisRecombinant plasmid-bearing colonies were obtained from the nonamplified S. bicolor root hair phagemid library by mass excision, and then plasmid mini-preparations were performed for 6,624 randomly selected isolates arrayed into 69 96-well plates. 5′ DNA sequencing reactions were performed using ABI BigDye Terminator Cycle Sequence Ready Reaction kits (versions 2 and 3; Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) as described previously (26Pratt L.H.

Genome Res. 1998; 8: 175-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (4858) Google Scholar), and vector, adapter, and low quality sequence ends were identified using an in-house processing script (28Liang C. Sun F. Wang H. Qu J. Freeman Jr., R.M. Pratt L.H. Cordonnier-Pratt M.-M. BMC Bioinformatics. 2006; 7: 115Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), resulting in 5,468 high quality sequences, or an 82.6% success rate. The average trimmed EST length, determined using a moving window with a PHRED quality score of 16, was 451 bp, of which on average 432 bp were called with a quality score equal to or greater than 20. The resulting 5,468 root hair ESTs were assembled using TGICL (29Pertea G. Huang X. Liang F. Antonescu V. Sultana R. Karamycheva S. Lee Y. White J. Cheung F. Parvizi B. Tsai J. Quackenbush J. Bioinformatics (Oxf.). 2003; 19: 651-652Crossref PubMed Scopus (1499) Google Scholar). Provisional annotation of all EST and contig consensus sequences was performed by BLASTX analysis against all full-coding length entries from the PIR-NREF data base (30Altschul S.F. Madden T.L.

EST data mining was performed using the MAGIC Gene Discovery software (32Cordonnier-Pratt M-M. Liang C. Wang H. Kolychev D.S. Sun F. Freeman R. Sullivan R. Pratt L.H. Comp. Funct.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3389-3402Crossref PubMed Scopus (59448) Google Scholar). Provisional gene ontology (GO) categorization of the assembled data set was performed by BLASTX analysis against all UniProt peptide sequences downloaded from the European Bioinformatics Institute web site (EBI UniProt release 9.0). An E value cutoff of E < 10-10 was applied to the BLASTX returns, and the corresponding full GO terms from significant matches were retrieved using the association table provided by the Gene Ontology Consortium web site. Full GO terms retrieved were finally mapped to their Plant GOSlim counterparts (33Berardini T.Z. Mundodi S. Reiser L. Huala E. Garcia-Hernandez M. Zhang P. Mueller L.A. Yoon J. Doyle A. Lander G.

Quantitative Real Time RT-PCR AnalysisQuantitative real time PCRs were performed in triplicate using the GenAmp® 5700 sequence detection system (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) as described previously (34Baerson S.R. Sánchez-Moreiras A. Pedrol-Bonjoch N. Schulz M. Kagan I.A. Agarwal A.K. Reigosa M.J. Duke S.O. J. Biol.

First strand cDNAs were synthesized from 2 μg of total RNA in a 100-μl reaction volume using the TaqMan reverse transcription reagents kit (Applied Biosystems) per the manufacturer's instructions. Independent PCRs were performed using the same cDNA for both the gene of interest and 18 S rRNA, using the SYBR® Green PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems) with the following gene-specific primer pairs: SbOMT1 forward, 5′-GCATCTTCGTTCATGTACTTGTTACAC-3′, and reverse, 5′-CGACGAAGCACATCCTTACTATGAG-3′; SbOMT2 forward, 5′-GCGCCTCGTTTTCGTATGC-3′, and reverse, 5′-GAACATACAGCTCACCTTCTCTGC-3′; SbOMT3 forward, 5′-CAATTTCCCTTTTATGTTTAGCCTGATAG-3′, and reverse, 5′-TGCCAGGGTGTGATATGTGC-3′; polyubiquitin forward, 5′-CTTCCTCTGTCCCTCTGATGGAG-3′, and reverse, 5′-AAGACACGACCACGACATGC-3′; chlorophyll a/b-binding protein forward, 5′-TGGATTGATTGATGCTGCAAG-3′, and reverse, 5′-CGTGAAACAAGAGACACACATGC-3′; 18 S rRNA forward, 5′-GGCTCGAAGACGATCAGATACC-3′, and reverse, 5′-TCGGCATCGTTTATGGTT-3′. Primers were designed using Primer Express® software (Applied Biosystems) and the Amplify program (35Engels W.R. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1993; 18: 448-450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). A dissociation curve was generated at the end of each PCR cycle to verify that a single product was amplified using software provided with the GenAmp® 5700 sequence detection system. A negative control reaction in the absence of template (no template control) was also routinely performed in triplicate for each primer pair. The change in fluorescence of SYBR® Green I dye in every cycle was monitored by the GenAmp® 5700 system software, and the threshold cycle (CT) above background for each reaction was calculated. The CT value of 18 S rRNA was subtracted from that of the gene of interest to obtain a ΔCT value. The CT value of an arbitrary calibrator (e.g. the tissue sample from which the largest ΔCT values were obtained) was subtracted from the ΔCT value to obtain a ΔΔCT value. The fold changes in expression level relative to the calibrator were expressed as 2-ΔΔCT. Southern Blot AnalysisGenomic DNA from S. bicolor genotype BTx623 was prepared from young leaf tissue using the Plant DNAzol Reagent (Invitrogen). Approximately 1 g of powdered tissue was mixed with 3.0 ml of plant DNAzol reagent supplemented with RNase A at a final concentration of 1.0 mg/ml and then incubated at room temperature for 10 min with gentle shaking. The remainder of the extraction procedure was carried out per the manufacturer's instructions, with an additional chloroform:isoamyl alcohol (24:1, v/v) extraction step performed prior to ethanol precipitation. Restriction endonuclease digestions and Southern blotting procedures were performed according to standard protocols (36Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 9.31-9.57Google Scholar). Probe sequences containing partial 3′-UTR and 3′ coding sequences were generated by PCR amplification from cloned SbOMT1, SbOMT2, and SbOMT3 cDNA templates with an Expand High Fidelity PCR kit (Roche Diagnostics) using a thermal profile of 94 °C for 30 s, then 55 °C for 1 min 30 s, followed by 72 °C for 1 min for 25 cycles. The following PCR primer pairs were used to generate probe sequences for the three S. bicolor OMTs: SbOMT1 forward, 5′-CACCAGAAGAAACACTAGCATCG-3′, and reverse, 5′-TTAAGGACCAATAAGCAAGCTAGTACA-3′; SbOMT2 forward, 5′-GAAGCACAGCTGCTGATGG-3′, and reverse, 5′-CAGCAAGCAACACACATCAAGTATG-3′; and SbOMT3 forward, 5′-ATGACTGGAGCAATGATGAGTG-3′, and reverse 5′-CAGGGTGCCAGGGTGTG-3′. For SbOMT1, the amplified regions correspond to nucleotides 966–1410 (445 bp in length; GenBank™ accession number EF189707), containing 191 bp of 3′-coding sequence and 254 bp of contiguous 3′-UTR sequence; for SbOMT2, amplified regions correspond to nucleotides 961–1424 (464 bp in length; GenBank™ accession number EF189706), containing 159 bp of 3′-coding sequence and 305 bp of contiguous 3′-UTR sequence; and for SbOMT3, amplified regions correspond to nucleotides 893–1376 (484 bp in length; GenBank™ accession number EF189708), containing 290 bp of 3′-coding sequence and 194 bp of contiguous 3′-UTR sequence. The resulting PCR products were cloned using a Zero Blunt TOPO PCR cloning kit (Invitrogen) and confirmed by DNA sequence analysis. Prior to use in labeling reactions, probe sequences were excised from the cloning vectors by restriction endonuclease digestion and then gel-purified.

We have identified a human mitochondrial UMP-CMP kinase (UMP-CMPK, cytidylate kinase; EC 2.7.4.14), designated as UMP-CMP kinase 2 (UMP-CMPK2). The C-terminal domain of this 449-amino acid protein contains all consensus motifs of a nucleoside monophosphate kinase. Phylogenetic analysis showed that UMP-CMPK2 belonged to a novel nucleoside monophosphate kinase family, which was closer to thymidylate kinase than to cytosolic UMP-CMP kinase. Subcellular localization with green fluorescent protein fusion proteins illustrated that UMP-CMPK2 was localized in the mitochondria of HeLa cells and that the mitochondrial targeting signal was included in the N-terminal 22 amino acids. The enzyme was able to phosphorylate dUMP, dCMP, CMP, and UMP with ATP as phosphate donor, but the kinetic properties were different compared with the cytosolic UMP-CMPK. Its efficacy to convert dUMP was highest, followed by dCMP, whereas CMP and UMP were the poorest substrates. It also phosphorylated the monophosphate forms of the nucleoside analogs ddC, dFdC, araC, BVDU, and FdUrd, which suggests that UMP-CMPK2 may be involved in mtDNA depletion caused by long term treatment with ddC or other pyrimidine analogs. UMP-CMPK2 mRNA expression was exclusively detected in chronic myelogenous leukemia K-562 and lymphoblastic leukemia MOLT-4 among eight studied cancer cell lines. Particular high expression in leukemia cells, dominant expression in bone marrow, and tight correlation with macrophage activation and inflammatory response suggest that UMP-CMPK2 may have other functions in addition to the supply of substrates for mtDNA synthesis.

Nucleotide synthesis is a basic biological process for cell proliferation and almost all other physiological activities in the cell. Two pathways have been reported for nucleotide synthesis: the de novo pathway and the salvage pathway (1Van Rompay A.R. Johansson M. Karlsson A. Pharmacol. Therap. 2000; 87: 189-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). In the de novo pathway, the synthesis of nucleotides starts from small molecules whereas in the salvage pathway, free nucleosides are directly used to synthesize ribonucleotides and deoxyribonucleotides. Mitochondria only have the salvage pathway for nucleotide synthesis. To our knowledge, there are seven enzymes of this pathway that have been cloned and studied in human tissues: thymidine kinase 2 (TK2) 2The abbreviations used are: TK2thymidine kinase 2DTTdithiothreitolGFPgreen fluorescent proteinmtDNAmitochondrial DNAddC2′,3′-dideoxycytidinedFdC2′,2′-difluorodeoxycytidinearaC1-β-d-arabinofuranosylcytosineBVDU(E)-5-(2-bromovinyl)-2′-deoxyuridineBVaraU1-β-d-arabinofuranosyl-5-(E)-(2-bromovinyl)uracilFdUrd5-fluorodeoxyuridineddIdideoxyinosineLPSlipopolysaccharideTNFαtumor necrosis factor αIFNαα-interferonIFNγγ-interferonIL-1βinterleukin-1βTGFβtransforming growth factor βUMP-CMPKUMP-CMP kinase.

The MDS may also arise from deficiencies of other enzymes involving mitochondrial nucleotide metabolism or transportation, such as the thymidine phosphorylase (TP) and the p53-controlled ribonucleotide reductase (p53R2) (27Nishino I.

These proteins account for just a fraction of all MDS cases and defects in other genes may also be involved in the etiology of MDS. To figure out the complete enzymatic steps of the salvage pathway for deoxyribonucleotide synthesis in mitochondria, we cloned and characterized the human homolog (hypothetical protein LOC129607, NCBI accession NP_997198) of a mouse gene, which was designated as thymidylate kinase family LPS-inducible member (TYKi) because of a putative thymidylate kinase domain (29Lee C.G. O'Brien W.E. J. Immunol. 1995; 154: 6094-6102PubMed Google Scholar). Previous studies showed that the expression of murine TYKi was induced or up-regulated by LPS and several cytokines (TNFα, IFNγ, IL-1β, IFNα) and was down-regulated by TGFβ (29Lee C.G. O'Brien W.E.

Here, we cloned the full-length coding sequence of the human cDNA and found that the gene product was localized in the mitochondria of HeLa cells. We expressed this protein in insect cells and purified it to homogeneity. The recombinant protein phosphorylated CMP, UMP, dCMP, dUMP, and monophosphates of the pyrimidine nucleoside analogs ddC, dFdC, araC, BVDU, and FdUrd. Based on its substrate recognition and intracellular location we designated this novel enzyme as mitochondrial UMP-CMP kinase and named it UMP-CMPK2. The relative phosphorylation efficacy of the natural substrates were dUMP > dCMP > CMP > UMP, which is different from the properties of cytosolic UMP-CMPK. The characteristics and phylogenetic analysis demonstrated that this protein comes from a novel family of UMP-CMP kinases. Cloning of Human UMP-CMPK2 cDNA—For PCR amplification of UMP-CMPK2 cDNA, the ATCC image clone 3063188 (GenBank™ ID: AW408129, BC089425) (ATCC: 9556333) was used as template, the forward primer containing the encoding sequence of the first 13 amino acids of hypothetical protein LOC129607 was 5′-CAC CAT GGC CTT CGC CCG CCG GCT CCT GCG CGG GCC ACT GTC G-3′, the reverse primer was 5′-GAA GTA AAA TTA AGA TGC CTG GTC TCC AGT TTT CTG-3′. PCR was performed in an Apollo ATC201 Thermal Cycler (CLP Molecular Biology) with Platinum Pfx DNA polymerase (Invitrogen) and 2× PCRx Enhancer solution. The cycling parameters are 1× (94 °C, 2 min), 30× (94 °C, 30 s; 55 °C, 30 s; 68 °C, 2 min) and 1× (68 °C, 10 min). PCR products were cloned into pENTR™/S.D./D-TOPO entry vector (Invitrogen) with TOPO cloning method to create an entry clone pENTR-UCMPK2-E448G. The clone was verified by DNA sequencing (MWG Biotech). Phylogenetic Analysis of UMP-CMPK2—Multiple sequence alignments were accomplished with Kalign program on the EBI server and edited with the GeneDoc v2.6 program. The rooted tree was constructed with PhyML and was plotted with iTOL v1.01. Subcellular Localization of UMP-CMPK2—Two plasmids were constructed for protein expression in mammalian cells. The first plasmid was based on pEGFP-N1 vector (Clontech). Two oligos 5′-GAA TTC ATG GCC TTC GCC CGC CGG CTC CTG CGC GGG CCA CTG TCG GGG CCG CTG CTC GGG CGG CGC GGG GAT CCA-3′ and 5′-GGA TCC CCG CGC CGC CCG AGC AGC GGC CCC GAC AGT GGC CCG CGC AGG AGC CGG CGG GCG AAG GCC ATG AAT TCA-3′ were used to form a dsDNA fragment encoding the first 22 amino acids of UMP-CMPK2. This dsDNA was ligated into the EcoRI-BamHI site of pEGFP-N1 to create an expression plasmid pN22-GFP. The second plasmid was based on pcDNA-DEST47 destination vector (Invitrogen). Using pENTR-UCMPK2-E448G as template, with forward primer 5′-CAC CAT GGC CTT CGC CCG CCG GCT C-3′ and reverse primer 5′-GTG AGG ATC CGG TCC ACT AAA ACT ATT CTG GAT TAG G-3′ in which the stop codon was deleted for C-terminal fusion purpose, full-length coding region of UMP-CMPK2 cDNA was amplified by PCR under the same condition of the first PCR except the following parameters were used: 1× (94 °C, 3 min), 30× (94 °C, 15 s; 58 °C, 30 s; 68 °C, 2 min) and 1× (68 °C, 10 min). PCR products were cloned into pENTR™/S.D./d-TOPO to create an entry clone. The mammalian expression plasmid pUCMPK2-E448G-GFP was constituted by recombination of this entry clone and pcDNA-DEST47 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The HeLa cell line (American Type Culture Collection) was transfected with pN22-GFP and pUCMPK2-E448G-GFP according to the method described (19Curbo S. Amiri M. Foroogh F. Johansson M. Karlsson A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 311: 440-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). The cells were stained with MitoTracker Red (Molecular Probes) 48 h after transfection. Cell fluorescence was imaged with a Nikon Eclipse E600 microscope equipped with a SPORT RT digital camera. Expression and Purification of Recombinant UMP-CMPK2—The cDNA sequence without putative mitochondrial targeting signal was amplified by PCR with forward primer 5′-CAC CGG ATC CAT GGT CTG CGC TGG GGC CAT GG-3′ (with BamH I site), reverse primer 5′-GAA TTC CTA GTG ATG GTG ATG GTG ATG CGG TTC ACT AAA ACT ATT CTG-3′ (with EcoRI site and six histidine codons), Platinum Pfx DNA polymerase (Invitrogen) and 1× PCRx Enhancer solution. The cycling parameters are 1× (94 °C, 2 min), 30× (94 °C, 30 s; 58 °C, 30 s; 68 °C, 2 min) and 1× (68 °C, 10 min). PCR products were cloned into pENTR™/SD/D-TOPO to create an entry clone. The UMP-CMPK2Δ21-6His coding sequence from this entry clone was inserted into the BamHI-EcoRI site of the pBacPAK8 transfer vector (Clontech) to get a transfer construct. Recombinant virus was constructed by cotransfecting Spodoptera frugiperda (Sf9) cells with the transfer construct and BacPAK6 viral DNA according to the manufacturer's manual. Protein expression in Sf9 cells and the affinity chromatography were modified from reported protocol (36Korhonen J.A. Gaspari M. Falkenberg M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 48627-48632Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). Sf9 cells were harvested 72 h after infection with 10 p.f.u. of recombinant virus. The cells were lysed, and the extract was cleared by centrifugation at 40,000 rpm × 30 min, 4 °C, using a Beckman 45TI rotor. The recombinant proteins were purified with TALON Metal Affinity Resin (Clontech), desalted on PD-10 column (Amersham Biosciences) and followed by anion-exchange chromatography with a MonoQ HR5/5 (Amersham Biosciences) column pre-equilibrated in low salt Buffer IEX (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, 50 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1 mm DTT, and 1× protease inhibitors). After elution in a linear gradient (10 ml) of Buffer IEX (0.05–1 m NaCl), the recombinant proteins were concentrated with Centricon 10 devices (Millipore) and applied to a Superose 6 10/300 GL column (Amersham Biosciences) pre-equilibrated in Buffer GF (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 200 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, and 1 mm DTT). The proteins were eluted at a flow rate of 0.30 ml/min with 1.5 bed volumes of Buffer GF. The calibration of column was carried out with Bio-Rad gel filtration standard. Isoelectric Point Determination—The pI of recombinant protein was determined on a PhastSystem with IEF PhastGel IEF 3–9 media (Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's instruction. Enzyme Assays—The nucleoside monophosphates and nucleoside analogs (Sigma) were added at a final concentration of 1 mm in a 10-μl reaction mixture containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm unlabeled ATP, 1 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol) (Amersham Biosciences), and 0.1–1 μg of UMP-CMPK2Δ21-6His recombinant proteins. The reactions were carried out for 1 h (nucleoside monophosphates) or 2 h (nucleoside analogs) at 37 °C. 1 μl of reaction mixtures were spotted on poly(ethyleneimine)-cellulose F chromatography sheets (Merck Inc.), and the nucleosides were separated in 0.5 m ammonium formate, pH 3.5 (37Jean Lust M.A.S. J. Chromatogr. A. 1972; 71: 127-133Crossref Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The sheets were autoradiographed by phosphoimaging plates (BAS 1000, Fuji Photo Film). For Michaelis-Menten kinetic properties, the non-radiolabeled products were separated and quantified by reversed-phase HPLC using a Chromolith™ column (RP-18e, 100-4.6 mm) (Merck Inc.) as described before (19Curbo S. Amiri M. Foroogh F. Johansson M. Karlsson A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 311: 440-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Northern Blotting—The human cancer cell line Northern blot including the mRNA from 8 different cancer cell lines was purchased from Clontech Inc. A 644-bp cDNA encoding the C-terminal domain was used as probe. Hybridization was carried out according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cloning of the Full-length cDNA and Primary Structure Analysis of the UMP-CMPK2 Protein—The human UMP-CMP kinase 2 is currently recorded as hypothetical protein LOC129607 in Entrez Gene data base of NCBI. The genomic sequence is localized at 2p25.2. It is regarded as a thymidylate kinase family LPS-inducible member because its homology with mouse TYKi protein, which was LPS-inducible in macrophages and was supposed to have thymidylate kinase activity based on sequence similarity with thymidylate kinase (29Lee C.G. O'Brien W.E. J. Immunol. 1995; 154: 6094-6102PubMed Google Scholar). Although many ESTs already have been cloned, no mRNA or cDNA that covers the full-length coding region has been characterized. To clone the full-length cDNA, we selected the ATCC cDNA clone IMAGE3063188 (NCBI accession BC089425) as our PCR template. By adding the coding sequence of 8 missing amino acids in the forward primer, we PCR amplified the full-length cDNA of UMP-CMPK2. Because this cDNA was derived from BC089425, which contains a point mutation at the codon of the 448th amino acid (GGA (codon of glycine) in BC089425 and GAA (codon of glutamic acid) in genomic DNA and all other ESTs), we designated the protein coded by this cDNA sequence as UMP-CMPK2-E448G. For protein expression, this point mutation was corrected by using the genomic sequence in reverse primers for PCR amplification. An interesting feature of the cDNA sequence is that the first half of the coding sequence has high GC content. From the translation start site, the 650-bp cDNA at the 5′-end has 76.3% GC content, whereas the 3′-end cDNA sequence only has about 52.6% GC. UMP-CMPK2 has 449 amino acids, which is longer than UMP-CMPK (228 amino acids). Primary structure analysis with Motif Scan and multiple sequence alignment with other thymidylate kinases showed that the protein sequence had a thymidylate kinase domain (Fig. 1B). The C-terminal domain contains all the consensus motifs: P-loop (ATP/GTP binding motif A), LID domain, adenine-base binding loop, catalytic site, and potential substrate binding site (Fig. 1B). Phylogenetic analysis was accomplished among selected species, which evolutionarily cover a long distance range from prokaryotes to primates (Fig. 1A). UMP-CMPK2, UMP-CMPK, thymidylate kinase (TMPK), cytidylate kinase (CMPK), and uridylate kinase (UMPK) from some prokaryotes were selected for comparison. On the phylogenetic tree, it is clear that the distance between the UMP-CMPK2 family and the TMPK family was much shorter than the distance between UMP-CMPK2 and UMP-CMPK. The predicted UMP-CMPK2 of dogs has quite low homology with other UMP-CMPK2 members (Fig. 1, A and B). Subcellular Localization of UMP-CMPK2 in HeLa Cells—Original analysis with PSORT program showed that UMP-CMPK2 had high probability of being a mitochondrial protein with a putative cleavage site of the mitochondrial targeting signal after the 20th or the 32nd amino acid. To confirm this prediction, a dsDNA fragment encoding the first 22 amino acids of UMP-CMPK2 was synthesized and cloned into the pEGFP-N1 vector to construct N22-GFP fusion gene. After transfection with the pN22-GFP plasmid, HeLa cells were cultured for ∼48 h and then were stained with MitoTracker Red. Results showed that most of the green fluorescence of GFP distributed in a typical fibrillar pattern as mitochondria usually do. Overlay of the fluorescence signal of GFP and MitoTracker Red demonstrated the fibrillar mitochondrial localization in yellow color (Fig. 2, top panel). The full-length UMP-CMPK2-E448G cDNA was fused to the GFP gene and was transiently expressed in HeLa cells as a UMP-CMPK2-E448G-GFP fusion protein. As shown in Fig. 2, bottom panel, the green signal of UMP-CMPK2-E448G-GFP was also overlaid with the red signal of MitoTracker Red, which confirmed the mitochondrial localization of UMP-CMPK2 in HeLa cells. Protein Expression and Purification of Recombinant UMP-CMPK2—At first, we thought that this protein would have TMPK activity based on BLAST results and interpretation of the mouse homolog (29Lee C.G. O'Brien W.E. J. Immunol. 1995; 154: 6094-6102PubMed Google Scholar). Initially, UMP-CMPK2 was expressed as His-tagged and GST-tagged recombinant proteins in Escherichia coli, respectively. We cleaved off the tags with protease and purified the proteins to high homogeneity (>95%). All enzymatic activity assays performed under conditions for TMPK activity only showed UMP-CMP kinase activity. No phosphorylation of dTMP was detected (data not shown). Considering a report that human TMPK activity was undetectable in transformed yeast or from proteins of several E. coli expression systems (38Huang S.-H. Tang A. Drisco B. Zhang S.-q. Seeger R. Li C. Jong A. DNA Cell Biol. 1994; 13: 461-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), we overexpressed His-tagged recombinant UMP-CMPK2 in insect cells and obtained pure proteins for enzymatic assay. First we designed a new set of primers for PCR amplification. The forward primer started at the 22nd amino acid to remove the cleavable putative mitochondrial targeting signal. One ATG codon was added before the 22nd amino acid to start translation. The reverse primer was located around the position of stop codon, but the stop codon was replaced by a histidine codon followed by 5 more to encode the His6 tag. The E448G point mutation was also corrected to glutamic acid (Glu, E) by using the genomic sequence. The PCR products were used to construct recombinant Baculovirus carrying UMP-CMPK2Δ21-6His fusion gene. The Sf9 cells were infected with recombinant virus and harvested 3 days later. To characterize the properties of the enzyme, UMP-CMPK2Δ21-6His protein was first purified with affinity chromatography. The protein was quite pure according to the SDS-PAGE data (Fig. 3B, lane 2). To reach a higher purity we performed two more purification steps: anion-exchange and gel filtration chromatography. The final products had very high purity (>95%) as shown by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 3B) and gel filtration diagram (data not shown). The pI value of the recombinant protein was 6.05 as determined by isoelectric focusing method along with pI markers of pH 4.55–8.65 (Fig. 3A). The protein did not bind the MonoQ matrix stably at pH 8.0, especially when large amounts of proteins were loaded. Instead we used pH 8.5 for anion-exchange chromatography. Because the pH value in mitochondria is about 8.0 (39Llopis J. McCaffery J.M. Miyawaki A. Farquhar M.G. Tsien R.Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 6803-6808Crossref PubMed Scopus (925) Google Scholar, 40Abad M.F.C. Di Benedetto G. Magalhaes P.J. Filippin L. Pozzan T. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 11521-11529Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar), we kept pH 8.0 for gel filtration chromatography and the following activity assays. Gel filtration diagram showed two peaks of UMP-CMPK2. Referring to the molecular size calibration curve from gel filtration molecular size standards, the major peak was monomer, whereas the minor peak had molecular weight of ∼89 kDa indicating dimer form of the recombinant protein. Substrate Specificity of UMP-CMPK2—Substrate specificity of recombinant protein was studied with thin layer chromatography (TLC) assay by using the [γ-32P]ATP as phosphate donor. As shown in Fig. 4A, the recombinant UMP-CMPK2 could phosphorylate CMP, UMP, dCMP, and dUMP. We also investigated the phosphorylation of dCMP and dUMP analogs using a two-step enzymatic method. For dCyd analogs, the human deoxycytidine kinase (dCK) was added into each reaction to catalyze the first phosphorylation. The results showed that ddC-MP, dFdC-MP, and araC-MP can be phosphorylated by UMP-CMPK2 (Fig. 4B). For dUrd analogs, we used human TK2 for the coupled phosphorylation. BVDU-MP and FdU-MP were proved to be substrates of UMP-CMPK2 in this assay (Fig. 4C). Kinetic Properties of UMP-CMPK2—The Michaelis-Menten kinetic properties of the enzyme were determined with four natural substrates using reversed-phase HPLC (Table 1). The production of dUDP was calculated referring to the chromatography data of UDP because there was no pure dUDP standard available. UMP-CMPK2 showed preference for dUMP and dCMP compared with CMP and UMP. The dUMP was the preferred substrate and the Vmax/Km value was about 35-fold higher than that for dCMP, and about 1600-fold higher than that for the poorest substrate UMP. The differences in Vmax were about 11-fold ranging from 0.19 μmol/mg/min (UMP) to 1.77 μmol/mg/min (dCMP). The Vmax of CMP and dCMP was similar, whereas Vmax of dUMP was 2.5-fold of the maximum rate for UMP. The differences in Km were 63-fold ranging from 0.10 mm (dUMP) to 6.30 mm (UMP).

https://openalex.org/W2074185174,"Background It is generally accepted that CD8+ T cell responses play an important role in control of immunodeficiency virus replication. The association of HLA-B27 and -B57 with control of viremia supports this conclusion. However, specific correlates of viral control in individuals expressing these alleles have been difficult to define. We recently reported that transient in vivo CD8+ cell depletion in simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV)-infected elite controller (EC) macaques resulted in a brief period of viral recrudescence. SIV replication was rapidly controlled with the reappearance of CD8+ cells, implicating that these cells actively suppress viral replication in ECs. Methods and Findings Here we show that three ECs in that study made at least seven robust CD8+ T cell responses directed against novel epitopes in Vif, Rev, and Nef restricted by the MHC class I molecule Mamu-B*08. Two of these Mamu-B*08-positive animals subsequently lost control of SIV replication. Their breakthrough virus harbored substitutions in multiple Mamu-B*08-restricted epitopes. Indeed, we found evidence for selection pressure mediated by Mamu-B*08-restricted CD8+ T cells in all of the newly identified epitopes in a cohort of chronically infected macaques. Conclusions Together, our data suggest that Mamu-B*08-restricted CD8+ T cell responses effectively control replication of pathogenic SIVmac239. All seven regions encoding Mamu-B*08-restricted CD8+ T cell epitopes also exhibit amino acid replacements typically seen only in the presence of Mamu-B*08, suggesting that the variation we observe is indeed selected by CD8+ T cell responses. SIVmac239 infection of Indian rhesus macaques expressing Mamu-B*08 may therefore provide an animal model for understanding CD8+ T cell-mediated control of HIV replication in humans."

Voltage-dependent conformational changes in prestin generate changes in the length of OHCs. A loss of prestin function is reported to induce severe auditory deficiencies, suggesting prestin-dependent changes of OHC length may be at least a part of cochlear amplification. Here we expressed the recombinant FLAG-fused prestin proteins in Sf9 cells and purified to particles of a uniform size in EM. The square-shaped top view of purified prestin, the binding of multiple anti-FLAG antibodies to each prestin particle, the native-PAGE analysis, and the much larger molecular weight obtained from size exclusion chromatography than the estimation for the monomer all support that prestin is a tetramer (Zheng, J., Du, G.

The mammalian ear has specialized function in collecting sound signals and transmitting them to the nerve. Several amplifying systems are developed for sound collection. The pinna and ear canal funnel have suitable shapes for effective sound collection and condensation. The bones of the middle ear (malleus, incus, and stapes) convert the sound energy in the eardrum to the pressure waves in the fluid of the cochlea with 20-40-fold amplification. In the inner ear, a positive feedback loop generates synchronous force by sensing the vibrations within the organ of Corti, which amplifies gained sound signals more than 100 times, although the mechanisms are not clearly understood (1Robles L.

These changes are proposed to be caused by prestin (SLC26A5) (6Zheng J. Shen W. He D.Z. Long K.B. Madison L.D. Dallos P. Nature. 2000; 405: 149-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (994) Google Scholar, 7Ludwig J. Oliver D. Frank G. Klocker N. Gummer A.W. Fakler B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

It has been also reported that prestin responds to the membrane potential by harboring cytoplasmic anions (Cl- or HCO-3), as extrinsic voltage sensors, and changes its structure (8Oliver D. He D.Z. Klocker N. Ludwig J. Schulte U. Waldegger S. Ruppersberg J.P. Dallos P. Fakler B. Science. 2001; 292: 2340-2343Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar). Because prestin is densely embedded in the plasma membrane of the OHCs, the total length of the cell also changes as much as 5% as follows: decreases by depolarization and increases by hyperpolarization (9Ashmore J.F. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1987; 388: 323-347Crossref Scopus (673) Google Scholar, 10Santos-Sacchi J. Dilger J.P. Hear. Res. 1988; 35: 143-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). A voltage-dependent structural change was also observed in heterologously expressed cells, which strongly supports that prestin is a motor protein (6Zheng J. Shen W. He D.Z. Long K.B. Madison L.D.

They also revealed that the tetramer is constituted of the dimer unit, and the component subunits are connected by disulfide bonds. An oligomeric structure of prestin was also supported by FRET analysis (11Navaratnam D. Bai J.P. Samaranayake H. Santos-Sacchi J. Biophys.

Homozygous mutant mice have a loss in OHC electromotility in vitro and a hundredfold loss of cochlear sensitivity in vivo, without disrupting mechanoelectrical transduction in OHCs. In heterozygotes, the electromotility was halved, and a significant elevation in cochlear thresholds was observed (16Liberman M.C. Gao J. He D.Z. Wu X. Jia S. Zuo J. Nature. 2002; 419: 300-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (683) Google Scholar). Further study demonstrated that the prestin knock-out mice lose frequency selectivity in the compound action potential tuning curve, supporting the hypothesis of contributing prestin and OHC electromotility in the cochlear amplification (17Cheatham M.A. Huynh K.H. Gao J. Zuo J. Dallos P. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2004; 560: 821-830Crossref Scopus (128) Google Scholar). In addition, salicylate disrupts voltage-dependent length changes of the OHCs in vitro, through the competitive inhibition of anion incorporation to the prestin (8Oliver D. He D.Z. Klocker N. Ludwig J. Schulte U. Waldegger S. Ruppersberg J.P. Dallos P. Fakler B. Science. 2001; 292: 2340-2343Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar). Therefore, the disruption of prestin is considered as a cause of hearing loss and subjective tinnitus by administration of large doses of aspirin (18Cazals Y. Prog. Neurobiol. 2000; 62: 583-631Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). Prestin locates on the lateral membrane of the OHC in high densities (19Belyantseva I.A. Adler H.J. Curi R. Frolenkov G.I.

Brain Res. 2006; 1095: 51-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). It has been observed as highly accumulated membrane integral proteins (2,500 particles/μm2) about 11 nm in diameter by using the freeze-fracture technique (22Kalinec F. Holley M.C. Iwasa K.H. Lim D.J. Kachar B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 8671-8675Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar) and atomic force microscopy (AFM) (23Le Grimellec C. Giocondi M.C. Lenoir M. Vater M. Sposito G. Pujol R. J. Comp. Neurol. 2002; 451: 62-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Recent AFM observation of Chinese hamster ovary cells expressing recombinant prestin showed similar particles of diameters between 8 and 12 nm on the cell surface (24Murakoshi M. Gomi T. Iida K. Kumano S. Tsumoto K. Kumagai I. Ikeda K. Kobayashi T. Wada H. J. Assoc. Res. Otolaryngol. 2006; 7: 267-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), suggesting that reported particles on the surface of OHCs are the motor protein prestin. The change in OHC length occurs in microseconds (as fast as 20 kHz) (7Ludwig J. Oliver D. Frank G. Klocker N. Gummer A.W. Fakler B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 4178-4183Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar), the fastest movement among known motor proteins. Structural information of prestin is necessary for understanding the generation of the force and its regulation mechanisms. To address this issue, we purified recombinant prestin protein from baculovirus-infected Sf9 cells, observed the negatively stained molecules using EM, and reconstructed the 3D structure by single particle analysis (25Frank J. Three-dimensional Electron Microscopy of Macromolecular Assemblies: Visualization of Biological Molecules in Their Native State.

Molecular Biology and Infection of Sf9 Cells—Rat prestin cDNA with an hemagglutinin tag at its N terminus (a gift from Dr. Fakler) was used in this study (7Ludwig J. Oliver D. Frank G. Klocker N. Gummer A.W. Fakler B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 4178-4183Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). The entire insert (SpcI-HindIII fragment) was subcloned to a pBluescript SK(-) vector. The original hemagglutinin tag was removed by replacing the 5′ end of the NotI (vector)-NruI (insert) with a PCR product starting with GCG GCC GCC ATG. The FLAG tag was inserted at the C-terminal end of prestin by replacing the 3′ end (AccI (insert)-XhoI (vector)) with a PCR product that has a FLAG tag immediately after the prestin coding region in-frame and an XhoI site. The sequence was confirmed by DNA sequencing. The prestin cDNA tagged with the FLAG sequence was further subcloned to the pFastBac donor plasmid (Invitrogen) and used to transform the DH10Bac Escherichia coli strain to obtain the Bacmid DNA containing FLAG-tagged prestin. The Sf9 cells were infected with the recombinant Bacmid. After 96 h of infection, the supernatant, including the virus particles, was collected and applied to the next culture. By repeating this step five times, a high titer virus stock was obtained. For protein isolation, cells were harvested after 96 h of infection using Teflon cell scrapers, collected by centrifuge, immediately frozen, and stored at -80 °C until use (28Mio K. Kubo Y. Ogura T. Yamamoto T. Sato C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2005; 337: 998-1005Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Frozen cells were homogenized in 10 volumes (v/w) of TBS (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, at 4 °C, 150 mm NaCl) with a Teflon homogenizer. Homogenates were first centrifuged for 15 min at 10,000 × g to remove debris, and the supernatant was further centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 60 min to obtain membrane fraction. All the procedures were performed on ice or at 4 °C. Protein Preparation—The membrane fraction was homogenized with a Teflon homogenizer in 4 ml of TBS (pH 7.4 at 4 °C) containing 50 mm n-dodecyl β-d-maltoside (DDM) (Sigma), protease inhibitor mixture tablets (EDTA-free; Roche Diagnostics), and 0.02% sodium azide. After centrifuging for 10 min at 15,000 × g, the supernatant containing the solubilized FLAG-tagged prestin was loaded onto a column containing 1 ml of anti-FLAG affinity gel (Sigma) pre-equilibrated with the same buffer. The column was then washed with 20 ml of wash buffer (TBS containing 5 mm DDM, 300 mm MgCl2, 0.02% sodium azide), and the bound protein was eluted with elution buffer containing 100 μg/ml FLAG peptide (Sigma). The elution was analyzed by silver staining and by Western blotting, and the mixture of two peak fractions (400 μl) was concentrated to 50 μl with a Microcon centrifuge filter unit YM-50 (Millipore). It was further purified by Superdex 200 (3.2/30) size exclusion chromatography (SEC) in a SMART system (GE Healthcare) with a TBS containing 5 mm DDM, 300 mm MgCl2, and 0.02% sodium azide. The elution of protein was monitored by absorbance at 280 nm and collected 20-μl fractions with a flow rate of 40 μl/min. Protein concentrations were determined using the BCA method (29Smith P.K. Krohn R.I. Hermanson G.T. Mallia A.K. Gartner F.H. Provenzano M.D. Fujimoto E.K. Goeke N.M. Olson B.J. Klenk D.C. Anal. Biochem. 1985; 150: 76-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (18647) Google Scholar). SDS and Native Gel Electrophoresis—The standard method of Laemmli (30Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207231) Google Scholar) was applied for the SDS-PAGE. Samples were mixed with a sample buffer containing 62.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, 25% glycerol, 0.04 m dithiothreitol, and 0.01% bromphenol blue and then incubated at 95 °C for 3 min. Proteins were separated in a 2-15% gradient acrylamide gel with an electrophoresis buffer containing SDS and visualized by silver staining. For Western blotting, proteins electrophoresed in the gel were transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane and detected with an anti-FLAG antibody (Sigma) and with a secondary antibody for chemiluminescent staining. Chemiluminescent images were obtained using a LAS-3000 mini image analyzer (Fujifilm). In the native gel electrophoresis (31Davis B.J. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1964; 121: 404-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (15957) Google Scholar), protein samples were combined with an equal volume of sample buffer (62.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 25% glycerol, and 0.01% bromphenol blue), and electrophoresed for 5 h at 60 V in a 7.5% acrylamide gel containing 0.5 mm DDM or in a 2-15% gradient acrylamide gel that did not contain DDM. The running buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.4, and 192 mm glycine) was supplemented with 0.1 mm DDM for protein stabilization. The separated proteins were compared with molecular standards as follows: thyroglobulin (669 kDa), ferritin (440 kDa), catalase (232 kDa), lactate dehydrogenase (140 kDa), and bovine serum albumin (67 kDa). Estimation of Molecular Weight and Stokes Radius by SEC—To calculate the molecular weight of the FLAG-tagged prestin, high molecular weight standard proteins (GE Healthcare) were used for column calibration (32Laurent T.C. Killander J. J. Chromatogr. 1964; 14: 317-330Crossref Google Scholar, 33Mio K. Ogura T. Hara Y. Mori Y. Sato C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2005; 333: 768-777Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The distribution coefficient, Kav, was calculated from the equation Kav = (Ve - V0)/(Vt - V0), where Ve is the elution volume of each reference protein or prestin protein. Column void volume (V0) was measured with blue dextran 2000, and Vt represents total bed volume. All the standards and the prestin were solubilized in the same buffer for prestin purification. Prestin elution was repeated three times. The prestin data is presented by average ± S.D. The same data set was applied to determine the Stokes radius (RS) of FLAG-tagged prestin using a calibration curve, which was constructed by plotting RS of reference proteins versus (-log Kav)1/2 according to the relationship (-log Kav)1/2 = α (β + RS) (32Laurent T.C. Killander J. J. Chromatogr. 1964; 14: 317-330Crossref Google Scholar).

Samples were washed with 5 drops of double-distilled water, negatively stained two times with 2% uranyl acetate solution for 30 s, blotted, and dried in air. Micrographs of negatively stained particles were recorded in a JEOL 100CX transmission electron microscope at ×55,000 magnification with 100-kV acceleration voltages. Images were recorded on SO-163 films (Eastman Kodak Co.), developed with a D19 developer (Kodak), and digitized with a Scitex Leaf-scan 45 scanner (Leaf Systems Inc) at a pixel size of 1.82 Å at the specimen level. Automated Particle Selection and 3D Reconstruction—Primary selection of prestin projections was performed automatically using the auto-accumulation method with simulated annealing (SA) (34Ogura T. Sato C. J. Struct. Biol. 2004; 146: 344-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Three hundred particles were extracted into 140 × 140 pixel subframes and used to train the auto pickup system of a three-layer pyramidal-type neural network (NN) (35Ogura T. Sato C. J. Struct. Biol. 2001; 136: 227-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 36Ogura T. Sato C. J. Struct. Biol. 2004; 145: 63-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 37Sato C. Hamada K. Ogura T.

Using the trained NN, a total of 14,346 particles was automatically selected from digitized EM films. Particles touching neighboring particles were discarded manually. In total, 13,149 images were analyzed after subtracting the uneven background. The selected particles were aligned rotationally and translationally by multireference alignment (MRA) (25Frank J.

To avoid introducing bias in reconstruction, reference-free alignment procedures are preferred for the first reference images (26van Heel M. Gowen B. Matadeen R. Orlova E.V. Finn R. Pape T. Cohen D. Stark H. Schmidt R. Schatz M. Patwardhan A. Q. Rev. Biophys. 2000; 33: 307-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar). In this study, the references at the first cycle were created automatically only by the NN program (36Ogura T. Sato C. J. Struct. Biol. 2004; 145: 63-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), which includes neither subjective procedures by human beings nor any symmetry imposition. The aligned images were subgrouped into 300 classes by the modified growing neural gas network (GNG) method (38Ogura T. Iwasaki K. Sato C. J. Struct. Biol. 2003; 143: 185-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). The class averages were used as new references, and this cycle was repeated 22 times. The orientational Euler angles of the class averages were determined by the echo-correlated 3D reconstruction method using SA (39Ogura T. Sato C. J. Struct. Biol. 2006; 156: 371-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), assuming a 4-fold symmetry. These were used to calculate a 3D structure by the simultaneous iterative reconstruction technique method (40Penczek P. Radermacher M. Frank J. Ultramicroscopy. 1992; 40: 33-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar). The reprojections from the initial volume were employed as references for MRA. Each image in the library was aligned and clustered, providing improved class averages. The 3D map was further refined until convergence by the projection matching method (41Penczek P.A.

Particle images that correlated poorly with the 3D projections were rejected automatically using the cross-correlation function. Final reconstruction included 98.1% of all the selected images. The Fourier shell correlation (FSC) function was used to assess the resolution of the final 3D map at the threshold of 0.5 (42Harauz G. van Heel M. Optik. 1986; 73: 146-156Google Scholar). Formation of the Prestin-Antibody Complex—Purified prestin and anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody (Sigma) were mixed for 30 min at 4 °C, and excessive antibodies were removed by SEC. Fab fragment of anti-FLAG antibody was generated by papain digestion using a commercial kit (Pierce). The Fab fragments were conjugated with colloidal gold particles (BB International), and the conjugate was separated from nonreacted Fab molecules by 10-30% glycerol gradient centrifugation. The Fab-gold conjugates were mixed with purified prestin, left on ice for 30 min, and negatively stained. In obtaining averages of prestin-antibody complex, 353 prestin-antibody complexes were manually picked up from 32 EM films, averaged, and classified into 15 groups by modified GNG method using preexistent prestin two-dimensional averages without antibody as templates. Expression and Purification of the Prestin Protein—Natural expression of prestin is limited to the outer hair cells of the inner ear and is too scarce for purification. To address this, we constructed a baculovirus containing FLAG-tagged prestin cDNA and infected Sf9 cells. We first expressed and purified either N- or C-terminally tagged prestin. As C-terminally tagged prestin expressed at higher efficiency, we have chosen this construct for further study (data not shown). Expression of C-terminally FLAG-tagged prestin was detected in Sf9 cells using an anti-FLAG antibody. More than 90% of the cells were positive in immunological detection with the anti-FLAG antibody, and about 10% of the cells expressed the fused protein at a much higher level (Fig. 1). Recombinant prestin was strongly localized at the plasma membrane, suggesting that infected cells expressed the FLAG-tagged prestin well, and that the product was correctly integrated into the plasma membrane (Fig. 1). Prestin proteins were concentrated from solubilized membrane fractions using FLAG affinity chromatography. Most of the remaining contaminants, especially those of smaller size, were eliminated by further purification using SEC (Fig. 2A). Three absorbance peaks were observed in SEC analysis as follows: a large asymmetrical peak at 0.87 ml elution, a medium sized peak at 1.17 ml elution, and a small rise at 1.46 ml elution, besides a peak of FLAG peptides at 2.0 ml of elution (Fig. 2B).FIGURE 2Purification of the prestin protein from baculovirus-infected Sf9 cells.A, FLAG-tagged prestin was solubilized from the cell membrane and then purified with immunoaffinity chromatography followed by SEC.

B, Superdex 200 SEC. Eluate from immunoaffinity gel was concentrated using a Microcon YM-50. The proteins are separated into fractions by Superdex 200 column. Large aggregated protein complexes (inset, bar represents 200 Å) are observed at the 0.87-ml peak. The elution of the prestin protein used for this analysis appears as a small bump at the elution volume of 1.17 ml (arrow). A peak at 2.0 ml is an absorbance of FLAG peptide applied to elute FLAG-fused protein. The elution of proteins was monitored at 280 nm absorbance. C, fractions obtained by SEC were electrophoresed in SDS gel under reducing conditions and visualized by silver staining. Purified prestin is detected at ∼80 kDa, as indicated by an arrowhead. Elution volumes and sizes of molecular standards are indicated at the top and the right, respectively. D, Western blotting using anti-FLAG antibody confirms that the purified protein is the FLAG-tagged prestin.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Aliquots from each SEC fraction were separated in SDS-PAGE and detected by silver staining (Fig. 2C) and Western blotting using an anti-FLAG antibody (Fig. 2D). In both detections, predominant bands were observed at the size estimated from the amino acid composition of prestin (81.4 kDa), suggesting that the prestin protein is correctly expressed on the Sf9 membrane (Fig. 2, C and D). The band intensity is strongest at the elution of 1.16-1.24 ml, which corresponds to the second peak in SEC (Fig. 2B). The 81.4-kDa band is also observed in the fractions at 0.84 and 0.92 ml, together with the higher molecular weight bands, corresponding to the first asymmetrical high peak (Fig. 2, C and D). In the fractions of the first peak, variously sized amorphous aggregations were observed using EM (Fig. 2B, inset), which appeared just after the void volume. Despite attempts at solubilization using various detergents and various mechanical methods (such as ultrasonication), formation of the large complexes could not be avoided. Indeed, these large complexes are tightly bound and could not be dissociated even by boiling in the reducing conditions for SDS-PAGE, as shown in the early fractions (Fig. 2, C and D). In the fractions of the third peak at 1.46 ml of elution, FLAG-fused protein was very low by Western blotting. For further analysis of prestin molecule, we used an SEC fraction with a 1.17-ml peak (a small bump indicated by an arrow in Fig. 2B). Estimation of the Molecular Weight and Diameter of Purified Prestin—SEC was used to estimate the molecular weight and diameters of prestin in aqueous solution (32Laurent T.C. Killander J. J.

https://openalex.org/W2074379754,"The influence of maternal environment on fetal development is largely unexplored, the available evidence concerns only the deleterious effects elicited by prenatal stress. Here we investigated the influence of prenatal enrichment on the early development of the visual system in the fetus. We studied the anatomical development of the rat retina, by analyzing the migration of neural progenitors and the process of retinal ganglion cell death, which exerts a key role in sculpturing the developing retinal system at perinatal ages. The number of apoptotic cells in the retinal ganglion cell layer was analyzed using two distinct methods: the presence of pyknotic nuclei stained for cresyl violet and the appearance of DNA fragmentation (Tunel method). We report that environmental enrichment of the mother during pregnancy affects the structural maturation of the retina, accelerating the migration of neural progenitors and the dynamics of natural cell death. These effects seem to be under the control of insulin-like growth factor-I: its levels, higher in enriched pregnant rats and in their milk, are increased also in their offspring, its neutralization abolishes the action of maternal enrichment on retinal development and chronic insulin-like growth factor-I injection to standard-reared females mimics the effects of enrichment in the fetuses. Thus, the development of the visual system is sensitive to environmental stimulation during prenatal life. These findings could have a bearing in orienting clinical research in the field of prenatal therapy."
https://openalex.org/W2127587232,"Objective New anti-malarial regimens are urgently needed in sub-Saharan Africa because of the increase in drug resistance. We investigated the safety and efficacy of azithromycin or artesunate combined with sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine used for treatment of malaria in pregnant women in Blantyre, Malawi. Methods/Findings This was a randomized open-label clinical trial, conducted at two rural health centers in Blantyre district, Malawi. A total of 141 pregnant women with uncomplicated Plasmodium falciparum malaria were recruited and randomly allocated to 3 treatment groups: sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP; 3 tablets, 500 mg sulfadoxine and 25 mg pyrimethamine per tablet); SP plus azithromycin (1 g/day×2 days); or SP plus artesunate (200 mg/day×3 days). Women received two doses administered at least 4 weeks apart. Heteroduplex tracking assays were performed to distinguish recrudescence from new infections. Main outcome measures were incidence of adverse outcomes, parasite and fever clearance times and recrudescence rates. All treatment regimens were well tolerated. Two women vomited soon after ingesting azithromycin. The parasite clearance time was significantly faster in the SP-artesunate group. Recrudescent episodes of malaria were less frequent with SP-azithromycin [Hazard Ratio 0.19 (95% confidence interval 0.06 to 0.63)] and SP-artesunate [Hazard Ratio 0.25 (95% confidence interval 0.10 to 0.65)] compared with SP monotherapy. With one exception (an abortion in the SP-azithromycin group), all adverse pregnancy outcomes could be attributed to known infectious or obstetrical causes. Because of the small sample size, the effect on birth outcomes, maternal malaria or maternal anemia could not be evaluated. Conclusions Both SP-artesunate and SP-azithromycin appeared to be safe, well tolerated and efficacious for the treatment of malaria during pregnancy. A larger study is needed to determine their safety and efficacy in preventing poor birth outcomes. Trial Registration ClinialTrials.gov NCT00287300"

Herein, we demonstrate that PERK also possesses tyrosine kinase activity. Specifically, we show that PERK is capable of autophosphorylating on tyrosine residues in vitro and in vivo. We further show that tyrosine 615, which is embedded in a highly conserved region of the kinase domain of PERK, is essential for autocatalytic activity. That is, mutation of Tyr-615 to phenylalanine compromises the autophosphorylation capacity of PERK and the phosphorylation of eIF2α in vitro and in vivo. The Y615F mutation also impairs the ability of PERK to induce translation of ATF4. Immunoblot analyses with a phosphospecific antibody confirm the phosphorylation of PERK at Tyr-615 both in vitro and in vivo.

A big part of the translational regulation is exerted at the level of initiation when the ribosome is recruited to an mRNA and positioned at the initiation codon (4Gebauer F. Hentze M.W. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2004; 5: 827-835Crossref PubMed Scopus (708) Google Scholar). A critical event in this process is the phosphorylation of the α subunit of translation initiation factor eIF2 at serine 51, a modification that blocks initiation (5Dever T.E. Cell. 2002; 108: 545-556Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (607) Google Scholar). This is because phosphorylated eIF2 acts as a dominant inhibitor of the guanine exchange factor eIF2B and prevents recycling of eIF2 between successive rounds of protein synthesis (6Proud C.G. Prog.

Recent findings, however, provided strong evidence for the regulation of eIF2α kinase activity by tyrosine phosphorylation. Specifically, we demonstrated that tyrosine phosphorylation is required for optimal activation of the eIF2α kinase PKR in response to double-stranded RNA or virus infection (16Su Q. Wang S. Baltzis D. Qu L.K. Wong A.H. Koromilas A.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 63-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Furthermore, we demonstrated that site-specific tyrosine phosphorylation of PKR is an important link between interferon signaling and translational control (17Su Q. Wang S. Baltzis D. Qu L.K. Raven J.F. Li S. Wong A.H. Koromilas A.E. EMBO Rep. 2007; 8: 265-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Prompted by our findings with PKR, we have investigated whether other eIF2α kinases are similarly controlled by tyrosine phosphorylation. Herein, we demonstrate the dual specificity of PERK and its essential role in optimal activation of the kinase and eIF2α phosphorylation in response to ER stress. Cell Cultures and Treatments—The human A549 cells were maintained in F12K medium (Cellgro), whereas monkey kidney COS-1 cells and isogenic PERK+/+ and PERK-/- MEFs (18Harding H.P. Zhang Y.

For detection of tyrosine phosphorylation of endogenous PERK, cells (∼1 × 107) seeded onto 150-mm plates were washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (140 mm NaCl, 15 mm KH2PO4, pH 7.2, 2.7 mm KCl), and proteins were extracted with 600 μl of lysis buffer containing 130 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 2% SDS, and 1% β-mercaptoethanol. After incubation on ice for 20 min, the lysates were sonicated in a 550 Sonic Dismembrator (10% output, twice with 10-s pulses on ice) and cleared by centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was transferred to a fresh tube and heated at 100 °C for 10 min. Five hundred μl of protein extracts were diluted to a final volume of 2.5 ml in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline. Approximately 10 μg of antibody and 100 μl of packed volume of protein G-agarose were used for immunoprecipitation of each sample. The samples were incubated with the antibody and Sepharose beads overnight under rotation at 4 °C and washed 3 times with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline before being subjected to SDS-PAGE.

After incubation with the secondary horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse or anti-rabbit IgG antibodies (1:1000 dilution; Amersham Biosciences), proteins were visualized with the enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) detection system according to the manufacturer's instructions (Amersham Biosciences).

We employed human A549 cells, which contain high levels of PERK among many cell lines tested (data not shown), to detect its tyrosine phosphorylation. Due to rapid dephosphorylation and degradation of tyrosine-phosphorylated PERK in buffers that preserve its activity (data not shown), we attempted the immunoprecipitation of endogenous PERK from protein extracts prepared under denaturing condition. We found that immunoprecipitated PERK cross-reacted with anti-phosphotyrosine-specific antibody in untreated cells (Fig. 1A, panel a, lane 1), indicating the presence of basal levels of tyrosine-phosphorylated kinase in proliferating cells. The intensity of the signal with the anti-phosphotyrosine antibody was more highly induced after treatment with TG indicating that increased tyrosine phosphorylation of PERK coincides with its activation in response to ER stress (Fig. 1A, panel a, lanes 2 and 3). Immunoblot analysis with anti-PERK specific antibodies showed that tyrosine-phosphorylated PERK co-migrated with the immunoprecipitated kinase (panel b). Furthermore, immunoblot analysis of the denatured protein extracts before and after immunoprecipitation with anti-PERK antibodies showed that a significant amount of endogenous PERK was immunodepleted under the conditions of the experiments (Fig. 1A, panel c). To further verify the tyrosine phosphorylation of endogenous PERK, protein extracts prepared under the same denaturing conditions were immunoprecipitated with anti-phosphotyrosine-specific antibody followed by immunoblotting with anti-PERK antibodies (Fig. 1B, panel a). We detected PERK in untreated cells (Fig. 1B, panel a, lane 1), consistent with the presence of basal levels of tyrosine phosphorylation of the kinase. Interestingly, treatment with TG resulted in the immunoprecipitation of two forms of PERK that differed in size (panel a, lanes 2 and 3); the slower (upper) migrating form of PERK was indicative of its hyperphosphorylation in response to ER stress as documented in many studies (see also below). Immunoblot analysis of the denatured protein extracts before and after immunoprecipitation for PERK indicated that a significant portion of the kinase was immunodepleted after incubation with the anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (Fig. 1B, panel b, compare lanes 4-6 with lanes 1-3). In fact, a higher amount of PERK was immunodepleted with the anti-phosphotyrosine antibody after ER stress (Fig. 1B, panel b, lanes 5 and 6) consistent with the increased detection of tyrosine-phosphorylated PERK by immunoprecipitation (panel a, lanes 2 and 3). These data supported the tyrosine phosphorylation of endogenous PERK. Next, we tested the tyrosine phosphorylation of recombinant PERK. Because GST-PERK WT expressed in bacteria is already autophosphorylated, recombinant GST-PERK WT was first treated with calf intestinal phosphatase to remove the pre-existing autophosphorylation and then subjected to autokinase assay in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP. Phosphoamino acid analysis detected the autophosphorylation of the kinase mainly on serine and threonine residues but also on tyrosine residues (Fig. 2A). To verify tyrosine phosphorylation, GST-PERK WT was treated with a recombinant GST fusion protein consisting of the tyrosine-specific phosphatase TC-PTP (29Ibarra-Sanchez M.J. Simoncic P.D. Nestel F.R. Duplay P. Lapp W.S. Tremblay M.L. Semin. Immunol. 2000; 12: 379-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2B). Treatment with the phosphatase rendered tyrosine phosphorylation of GST-PERK WT undetectable (panel a, lane 1) as opposed to treatment with the catalytic inactive phosphatase mutant GST-TC-PTPD182A, which did not interfere with the detection of the tyrosine-phosphorylated kinase (panel a, lane 3). The noted differences in migration between the active and inactive GST-PERK proteins (Fig. 2B, panel b) were due to hyperphosphorylation and retardation of the active kinase in polyacrylamide gels as reported (19Baltzis D. Qu L.K. Papadopoulou S. Blais J.D. Bell J.C. Sonenberg N. Koromilas A.E. J. Virol. 2004; 78: 12747-12761Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Given that detection of GST-PERK-K618A with anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies was not possible (panel a, lanes 2 and 4), we conclude that PERK does not possess an epitope that mimics tyrosine phosphorylation. Our previous work identified Tyr-293 of PKR as a functional autophosphorylation site (16Su Q. Wang S. Baltzis D. Qu L.K. Wong A.H. Koromilas A.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 63-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Tyr-293 lies within the catalytic subdomain II of PKR and is highly conserved among all homologs of the eIF2α kinases (16Su Q. Wang S. Baltzis D. Qu L.K. Wong A.H. Koromilas A.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 63-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) (Fig. 3A). Given the essential role of Tyr-293 in PKR activation (16Su Q. Wang S. Baltzis D. Qu L.K. Wong A.H. Koromilas A.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 63-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), we were interested to examine whether this invariant Tyr-615 is phosphorylated in PERK and whether this modification affects PERK activity. We first tested whether the phosphospecific anti-PKR-Tyr(P)-293 antibody is suitable for detection of phosphorylated PERK at Tyr-615 given the high homology between the two kinases in this region (Fig. 3A). To verify the specificity of the antibody for PERK, we performed the immunoblotting in the presence of a PERK peptide bearing Tyr-615 in either non-phosphorylated or phosphorylated form. We noticed that, in the presence of the non-phosphorylated PERK peptide, the phosphospecific antibody reacted with catalytic active GST-PERK (Fig. 3B, panel a, lane 1) but not with GST-PERK-K618A (lane 2) or GST-PERK-Y615F (lane 3). Contrary to this, the phosphorylated at Tyr-615 PERK peptide abolished the recognition of active GST-PERK with the phosphospecific anti-PKR-Tyr(P)-293 antibody (panel a, lane 4). These data confirmed the suitability of the anti-PKR-Tyr(P)-293 antibody for the detection of PERK phosphorylated at Y615. When, immunoblotting were performed with anti-phosphotyrosine antibody, we noticed that detection of tyrosine phosphorylation of GST-PERK-Y615F was not possible (Fig. 3C, panel a, lane 2). This finding indicated that either Tyr-615 is the only tyrosine phosphorylation site on GST-PERK or Y615F mutation has had a significant effect on GST-PERK autophosphorylation. To distinguish between the two possibilities we tested the overall catalytic activity of GST-PERK-Y615F in terms of autophosphorylation and eIF2α phosphorylation in kinase assays with [γ-32P]ATP (Fig. 3D). We found that autophosphorylation of GST-PERK-Y615F was significantly compromised to undetectable levels as was the case with the catalytic inactive GST-PERK-K618A mutant (panel a, compare lanes 2 and 3). Furthermore, the ability of GST-PERK-Y615F to phosphorylate recombinant eIF2α remained equally undetectable (panel b, lane 3). These findings provided evidence for an essential role of Tyr-615 in PERK activation in vitro. The above data prompted us to examine the role of Tyr-615 in PERK activation in vivo. To do so we employed Myc-tagged forms of wild type and mutant PERK proteins for transient expression in COS1 cells. Expression of Myc-tagged PERK WT led to the induction of its phosphorylation at Tyr-615 (Fig. 4A, panel a) and phosphorylation of endogenous eIF2α phosphorylation at Ser-51 (panel c) as opposed to Myc-tagged PERK-K618A and PERK-Y615F mutants, which were not phosphorylated at Tyr-615 (panel a) and were unable to increase phosphorylation of endogenous eIF2α (panel c). Also, the overall autophosphorylation capacity of the Myc-tagged PERK-Y615F and PERK-K618A mutants was abolished compared with the autophosphorylation of Myc-tagged PERK WT (Fig. 4A, panel e; compare lanes 3 and 4 with lane 1). The lack of the autocatalytic activities of the PERK mutants was further supported by their inability to mediate the phosphorylation of recombinant eIF2α (panel f). When the same Myc-tagged forms of PERK were expressed in a separate experiment and probed with anti-phosphotyrosine antibody, we noticed that detection of phosphorylation was possible for Myc-tagged PERK WT only after treatment with TG (Fig. 4B, panel a, lane 6). Contrary to active PERK, detection of tyrosine phosphorylation of the Myc-tagged PERK mutants with the anti-phosphotyrosine antibody was not possible (panel a, lanes 7 and 8). Activation of Myc-tagged PERK WT was also evident by its slow migration in the polyacrylamide gels compared with Myc-tagged PERK mutants (panel b). Furthermore, a higher amount of endogenous eIF2α was phosphorylated at Ser-51 in cells expressing Myc-tagged PERK WT than in cells expressing the Myc-tagged PERK mutants (panel c), consistent with the impaired catalytic activity of the PERK mutants. These data further substantiated an important role for Tyr-615 in PERK activation in vivo. We next examined Tyr-615 phosphorylation of PERK in vivo. Phosphorylation of Myc-tagged PERK WT at Tyr-615 became evident in transiently transfected COS1 cells after immunoprecipitation with anti-Myc antibody and immunoblotting with the phosphospecific anti-PKR-Tyr(P)-293 antibody (Fig. 5A, panel a). In fact, Tyr-615 phosphorylation of Myc-tagged PERK WT coincided with its phosphorylation at Thr-980 within the activation loop of the kinase (panel b). Contrary to Myc-tagged PERK WT, neither of the Myc-tagged PERK mutants was recognized by the phosphospecific antibody (panels a and b). Detection of Tyr-615 phosphorylation was also possible in whole cell extracts from COS1 cells transiently transfected with Myc-tagged PERK WT but not with Myc-tagged PERK-K618A (Fig. 5B, panel a). In these experiments we noticed a shift of phosphorylated Myc-tagged PERK WT after infection with VSV (panel a, lane 5), which activates PERK (19Baltzis D. Qu L.K. Papadopoulou S. Blais J.D. Bell J.C. Sonenberg N. Koromilas A.E. J. Virol. 2004; 78: 12747-12761Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), or after treatment with TG (panel a, lane 8). These differences in PERK mobility were further verified by immunoblotting with anti-Myc antibody (panel b) and are explained by a higher induction of PERK activity in response to VSV infection or ER stress. This interpretation is also supported by the higher levels of endogenous eIF2α phosphorylation at Ser-51 in response to these treatments (panel c, lanes 5 and 8). To further substantiate Tyr-615 phosphorylation of PERK in vivo, we employed human A549 cells for immunoprecipitation of the endogenous kinase with the phosphospecific anti-PKR-Tyr(P)-293 antibody from protein extracts prepared under denaturing conditions. Similarly to experiments described in Fig. 1, we detected a fair amount of PERK to be immunoprecipitated with the phosphospecific anti-PKR-Tyr(P)-293 antibody (Fig. 5C, panel a). A fraction of immunoprecipitated PERK displayed a slower mobility after treatment with TG compared with PERK immunoprecipitated from untreated cells (panel a, compare lanes 2 and 3 with lane 1), indicating the hyperphosphorylation of the kinase in response to ER stress. Immunoblot analysis of whole protein extracts before and after immunoprecipitation revealed that a significant fraction of PERK was immunodepleted by the phosphospecific PKR-Tyr(P)-293 antibody (panel b, compare lanes 5 and 6 with lane 4). Collectively, these data showed that Tyr-615 phosphorylation of PERK takes place in vivo and is important for the activation of the eIF2α kinase in response to ER stress. To address the functionality of Tyr-615 phosphorylation, we examined the ability of PERK-Y615F mutant to stimulate translation of ATF4 mRNA, which is solely dependent on eIF2α phosphorylation (27Vattem K.M. Wek R.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 11269-11274Crossref PubMed Scopus (1109) Google Scholar). To this end, PERK-/- MEFs were co-transfected with Myc-tagged PERK WT, PERK-K618A, or PERK-Y615F, and a fusion of the luciferase reporter gene was transcribed to an mRNA containing either ATF4 5′-untranslated region (UTR) or an ATF4 5′-UTR mutant lacking ORF1 function (Δ1) (27Vattem K.M. Wek R.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 11269-11274Crossref PubMed Scopus (1109) Google Scholar) (Fig. 5D). We found that neither of the PERK mutants was capable of stimulating the activity of the reporter gene as opposed to PERK WT, which did so efficiently (Fig. 5D). Induction of luciferase activity in cells transfected with ATF4 mutant ORF1 (Δ1)/luciferase and PERK WT was not possible (Fig. 5D), supporting previous data that the ATF4/luciferase reporter assay faithfully represents translation of endogenous ATF4 mRNA as a result of eIF2α phosphorylation (27Vattem K.M. Wek R.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 11269-11274Crossref PubMed Scopus (1109) Google Scholar). These data provided a link between tyrosine phosphorylation of PERK and translational control of ATF4 mRNA. Our findings support the function of PERK as a dual specificity kinase and are in line with an earlier study showing the tyrosine phosphorylation of recombinant PERK by mass spectrometry (30Ma Y. Lu Y. Zeng H. Ron D. Mo W. Neubert T.A. Rapid Commun. Mass Spectrom. 2001; 15: 1693-1700Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Although tyrosine phosphorylation of PERK in vitro is clearly an autophosphorylation event, phosphorylation of PERK tyrosine residues in vivo could also require the activity of other kinase(s) in a manner similar to that previously documented for PKR (17Su Q. Wang S. Baltzis D. Qu L.K. Raven J.F. Li S. Wong A.H. Koromilas A.E. EMBO Rep. 2007; 8: 265-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Experiments with phosphospecific antibodies indicated that untreated cells contained basal levels of tyrosine-phosphorylated endogenous PERK. For example, a significant amount of endogenous PERK was immunoprecipitated with anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (Fig. 1B) or anti-PKR-Tyr(P)-293 antibody (Fig. 5C) from untreated cells. These data suggest that tyrosine phosphorylation of PERK takes place as soon as the protein is produced within the cells. This interpretation is also supported by the finding that ectopically expressed PERK is phosphorylated at Tyr-615 before induction of ER stress (Fig. 5A). Nevertheless, when ectopically expressed PERK was immunoprecipitated before ER stress treatment, tyrosine phosphorylation with anti-phosphotyrosine antibody was not detected (Fig. 4B, lane 2). The most conceivable interpretation is that anti-PKR-Tyr(P)-293 antibody is more sensitive for detecting phosphorylated PERK than the anti-phosphotyrosine antibody. It is also of interest that immunoprecipitation of endogenous PERK with the anti-phosphotyrosine antibody yielded two distinct forms of the tyrosine-phosphorylated kinase based on its migration in polyacrylamide gels (Fig. 1B, panel a). These forms, however, were not evident when endogenous PERK was immunoprecipitated with the anti-PKR-Tyr(P)-293 antibody (Fig. 5C, panel a). This finding may indicate the presence of two different pools of tyrosine-phosphorylated PERK, one of which is enriched with PERK phosphorylated at Tyr-615. Consistent with this interpretation, immunoprecipitation of endogenous PERK with anti-PERK antibodies followed by immunoblotting with the anti-phosphotyrosine antibody yielded a single band of tyrosine-phosphorylated PERK, which was more highly induced after TG treatment (Fig. 1A, panel a). This result may also imply that the anti-PERK antibodies display a higher affinity for a single pool of tyrosine-phosphorylated kinase during immunoprecipitation for reasons that are not immediately clear. Despite the noted differences in the specificity of the antibodies, when examined in concert these experiments supported the notion that PERK is indeed modified by tyrosine phosphorylation in untreated cells and tyrosine phosphorylation of PERK is more highly induced in response to ER stress. Although more than one tyrosine residue of PERK is likely to be modified by phosphorylation, our data provide strong evidence that Tyr-615 plays a critical role in kinase activation (Figs. 3 and 4). The Y615F mutation is impaired in both basal and stress-induced (global) PERK phosphorylation. The latter is consistent with the notion that Tyr-615 phosphorylation could be altering the overall structure of the N-terminal lobe of the kinase to affect catalysis. PERK phosphorylation at Tyr-615 is detected before ER stress treatment (Figs. 5, A-C) consistent with the notion that its phosphorylation may prime the eIF2α kinase to full-scale activation. How Tyr-615 becomes phosphorylated is not presently known. Conformational changes of full-length PERK caused by the presence and function of the stress-sensing luminal domain (31Bertolotti A. Zhang Y. Hendershot L.M. Harding H.P. Ron D. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 326-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (2080) Google Scholar) could alter the accessibility of Tyr-615 for autophosphorylation and possible phosphorylation by another kinase(s). It is also possible that tyrosine phosphorylation of PERK, PKR, and potentially of other eIF2α kinases is a process that takes place during protein synthesis and before acquisition of the final conformation as has been recently suggested for tyrosine-phosphorylated glycogen synthase kinase 3β (32Lochhead P.A. Kinstrie R. Sibbet G. Rawjee T. Morrice N. Cleghon V. Mol. Cell. 2006; 24: 627-633Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). This would be consistent with the detectable basal levels of tyrosine-phosphorylated kinase in untreated cells. Our previous data with PKR demonstrated that phosphorylation at Tyr-293 is required for optimal phosphorylation of Thr-446, which lies within the activation loop of the kinase (16Su Q. Wang S. Baltzis D. Qu L.K. Wong A.H. Koromilas A.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 63-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Consistent with this, Tyr-615 phosphorylation of PERK coincides with phosphorylation at Thr-980 within the activation loop of the kinase (Fig. 5A), further supporting a positive role of Tyr-615 phosphorylation in PERK activation. Concerning the biological relevance of our findings, the ability of PERK to act as a dual specificity kinase may be associated with the operation of novel signaling pathways that control ER homeostasis and its response to various forms of stress. Structural and functional data for the kinase domain of PKR in bacteria and yeast have led to the conclusion that the only substrate of the kinase is eIF2α (33Dey M. Cao C. Dar A.C. Tamura T. Ozato K. Sicheri F. Dever T.E. Cell. 2005; 122: 901-913Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar, 34Dar A.C. Dever T.E. Sicheri F. Cell. 2005; 122: 887-900Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). However, in mammalian cells tyrosine phosphorylation of the eIF2α kinases may affect substrate specificity leading to phosphorylation of proteins other than eIF2α. Such post-translational modifications could account for the phosphorylation of previously identified substrates of PKR and PERK including the viral protein Tat (35McMillan N.A. Chun R.F.

Transformation by NPM-ALK not only increases proliferation, but also modifies cell shape and motility in both lymphoid and fibroblastic cells. We report that the Rac1 GTPase, a known cytoskeletal regulator, is activated by NPM-ALK in ALCL cell lines (Karpas 299 and Cost) and transfected cells (lymphoid Ba/F3 cells, NIH-3T3 fibroblasts). We have identified Vav3 as one of the exchange factors involved in Rac1 activation. Stimulation of Vav3 and Rac1 by NPM-ALK is under the control of Src kinases. It involves formation of a signaling complex between NPM-ALK, pp60(c-src), Lyn and Vav3, in which Vav3 associates with tyrosine 343 of NPM-ALK via its SH2 domain. Moreover, Vav3 is phosphorylated in NPM-ALK positive biopsies from patients suffering from ALCL, demonstrating the pathological relevance of this observation. The use of Vav3-specific shRNA and a dominant negative Rac1 mutant demonstrates the central role of GTPases in NPM-ALK elicited motility and invasion."

Previous progress has been made towards delineating the VPF/VEGF survival signaling downstream of the activation of VEGFR-2. Here, we seek to define the function of NRP-1 in VPF/VEGF-induced survival signaling in EC and to elucidate the concomitant molecular signaling events that are pivotal for our understanding of the signaling of VPF/VEGF. Utilizing two different in vitro cell culture systems and an in vivo zebrafish model, we demonstrate that NRP-1 mediates VPF/VEGF-induced EC survival independent of VEGFR-2. Furthermore, we show here a novel mechanism for NRP-1-specific control of the anti-apoptotic pathway in EC through involvement of the NRP-1-interacting protein (NIP/GIPC) in the activation of PI-3K/Akt and subsequent inactivation of p53 pathways and FoxOs, as well as activation of p21. This study, by elucidating the mechanisms that govern VPF/VEGF-induced EC survival signaling via NRP-1, contributes to a better understanding of molecular mechanisms of cardiovascular development and disease and widens the possibilities for better therapeutic targets."

The time-dependence of the intercellular binding probability exhibits a fast forming, low probability binding state, which transitions to a slower forming, high probability state. The biphasic kinetics are independent of the cytoplasmic region, but the transition to the high probability state requires the third extracellular domain EC3. Deleting either EC3 or EC3-5, or substituting Trp(2) for Ala reduces the binding curves to a simple, monophasic rise in binding probability to a limiting plateau, as predicted for a single site binding mechanism.

https://openalex.org/W2048596534,"Loss of the von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) tumor suppressor gene contributes to proliferative disorders including renal cell carcinoma. The consequence of VHL loss is increased levels of hypoxia-inducible factor-α (HIFα), which is targeted for proteolytic degradation by the VHL gene product pVHL. HIF is a transcription factor that increases the expression of factors critical for tumorigenesis in renal cell carcinoma. We report here another regulatory component of HIFα expression in renal cancer cells. Phospholipase D (PLD), which is commonly elevated in renal and other cancers, is required for elevated levels of both HIF1α and HIF2α in VHL-deficient renal cancer cells. The induction of both HIF1α and HIF2α by hypoxic mimetic conditions was also dependent on PLD in renal cancer cells with restored pVHL expression. The effect of PLD activity upon HIFα expression was at the level of translation. PLD activity also provides a survival signal that suppresses apoptosis induced by serum deprivation in the renal cancer cells. Suppression of HIF2α has been shown to reverse tumorigenesis with renal cancer cells. The finding here that HIF2α expression is dependent on PLD in renal cancer cells suggests that targeting PLD signals may represent an alternative therapeutic strategy for targeting HIF2α in renal cancers where HIF2α is critical for tumorigenesis and elevated PLD activity is common."
https://openalex.org/W2017196263,"The Gab2 docking protein is a target of several oncogenic protein tyrosine kinases and potentiates activation of the Ras/extracellular signal regulated kinase and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3-kinase) pathways. Since Gab2 is phosphorylated by c-Src, and both proteins are overexpressed in breast cancers, we have determined the biological consequences of their co-expression in the immortalized human mammary epithelial cell line MCF-10A. While overexpression of c-Src did not affect acinar morphogenesis or growth factor dependence in three-dimensional culture, c-Src co-operated with Gab2 to promote epidermal growth factor (EGF)-independent acinar growth. In contrast, expression of v-Src or the activated mutant c-SrcY527F led to a spectrum of aberrant phenotypes ranging from spheroids with incomplete luminal clearance to highly disrupted, dispersed structures. Gab2 co-expression shifted the phenotypic distribution towards the dispersed phenotype, an effect not observed with a Gab2 mutant unable to bind the p85 subunit of PI3-kinase (Gab2Δp85). In v-Src-expressing cells, Gab2, but not Gab2Δp85, significantly decreased E-cadherin adhesive strength without altering its surface expression. Gab2 associated with E-cadherin in the presence and absence of v-Src, indicating that the ability of Gab2 to weaken the strength of cell–cell contacts may reflect enhanced activation of PI3-kinase at adherens junctions. Gab2 also increased migration and invasion of these cells in transwell assays, but these effects were p85-independent. Overall, these findings demonstrate a novel mechanism whereby Gab2 may promote metastatic spread and indicate that Gab2 may play several roles during breast cancer progression."

https://openalex.org/W2042374956,"In mammalian cells, specific aminoacyl-transfer RNA (tRNA) synthetases have cytokine functions that require interactions with partners outside of the translation apparatus. Little is known about these interactions and how they facilitate expanded functions that link protein translation to other cellular pathways. For example, an alternative splice fragment of tryptophanyl-tRNA synthetase (TrpRS) and a similar natural proteolytic fragment are potent angiostatic factors that act through the vascular endothelial-cadherin receptor and Akt signaling pathway. Here we demonstrate mobilization of TrpRS for exocytosis from endothelial cells and the potential for plasmin to activate the cytokine function of the extracellular synthetase. Direct physical evidence showed that the annexin II-S100A10 complex, which regulates exocytosis, forms a ternary complex with TrpRS. Functional studies demonstrate that both annexin II and S100A10 regulate trafficking of TrpRS. Thus, complexes of mammalian tRNA synthetases with seemingly disparate proteins may in general be relevant to understanding how their expanded functions are implemented."

Wolf D.M. Arkin A.P. Nature. 2002; 420: 231-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (801) Google Scholar): the law of large numbers provides stability (15van Kamplen N.G. Stochastic Processes in Physics and Chemistry. North-Holland Publishing, Amsterdam2001Google Scholar). However, some ion channels are expressed at the PM in much smaller numbers: two or three ryanodine receptor-like channels in portal vein myocytes (16Loirand G. Pacaud P. Baron A. Mironneau C. Mironneau J. J. Physiol. 1991; 437: 461-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) and ∼10 Ca2+-activated K+ channels (IKCa1) in a resting T cell (17Ghanshani S. Wulff H. Miller M.J. Rohm H.

For such rare events as these and the expression of a very small number of IP3R in the PM (10Dellis O. Dedos S. Tovey S.C. Rahman T.-U. Dubel S.J. Taylor C.W. Science. 2006; 313: 229-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar), the law of large numbers cannot apply and the stability must be provided by additional regulatory mechanisms. Here we show that cells can reliably count very small numbers of IP3R into the PM in the absence of feedback signals. Expression of IP3R in DT40 Cells—DT40 cells were cultured at 37 °C in humidified air containing 5% CO2 in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 1% chicken serum, 2 mml-glutamine, and 10 μm 2-mercaptoethanol. QuikChange II XL (Stratagene) was used to introduce point mutations into rat IP3R1 without the S1 splice site (GenBank™ accession number JO5510). Constructs were verified by sequencing. Stable cell lines were selected (18Laude A.J. Tovey S.C. Dedos S. Potter B.V.L. Lummis S.C.R. Taylor C.W. Cell Calcium. 2005; 38: 45-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) and IP3R1 expression levels measured using 3H-IP3 binding or Western blotting as reported (10Dellis O. Dedos S. Tovey S.C. Rahman T.-U. Dubel S.J. Taylor C.W. Science. 2006; 313: 229-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). IP3 Binding to the IP3 Binding Core—The 1–604 fragment of IP3R1 was amplified by PCR from full-length IP3R1 lacking the S1 splice region and ligated as a SalI/EcoRI fragment into the pTrcHis A vector at the XhoI/EcoRI sites. Mutagenesis used the QuikChange II XL site-directed mutagenesis kit and the primers listed in supplemental Table S1. The His6-tagged fusion proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli (19Riley A.M.

Chem. 2002; 277: 40290-40295Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) and cleaved from their His6 tags using thrombin. Equilibrium-competition binding assays using 3H-IP3 (0.7 nm) were performed and analyzed as reported previously (19Riley A.M. Morris S.A. Nerou E.P. Correa V. Potter B.V.L. Taylor C.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 40290-40295Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). IP3-evoked Ca2+ Release—The ER of DT40 cells was loaded with a low affinity Ca2+ indicator (Mag fluo-4), and IP3-evoked Ca2+ release was measured from the saponin-permeabilized cells using a FlexStation as previously reported (20Tovey S.C. Sun Y. Taylor C.W. Nature Protocols. 2006; 1: 258-262Crossref Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Single Channel Recording—Single channel currents were recorded in the whole-cell configuration or from excised patches of nuclear envelope using the patch clamp technique exactly as reported (10Dellis O. Dedos S. Tovey S.C. Rahman T.-U. Dubel S.J. Taylor C.W. Science. 2006; 313: 229-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Except where indicated otherwise, bath solution (BS) contained 140 mm KCl, 10 mm Hepes, 500 μm BAPTA (1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid), 270μm CaCl2 (free [Ca2+] = 246 nm), pH 7.1, and pipette solution contained: 140 mm KCl, 10 mm Hepes, 100 μm BAPTA, 48.7 μm CaCl2 (free [Ca2+] = 212 nm), 500 μm ATP, pH 7.1, and IP3 (usually 10 μm). Most recordings were performed at negative potentials (–100 to –40 mV) to avoid contributions from voltage-gated K+ channels. DT40 Cells Unfailingly Express Very Few Functional IP3Rin the Plasma Membrane—Fig. 1A shows the number of functional IP3R detected in whole-cell patch clamp recordings from native DT40 cells, which are an avian pre-B lymphocyte cell line (11Winding P. Berchtold M.W. J. Immunol. Methods. 2001; 249: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). The relatively high open probability (Po) and duration of the recordings allow the number of functional channels to be confidently determined from the maximal number of simultaneous openings to the unitary current amplitude (see supplemental Methods and supplemental Fig. S1). Each DT40 cell expresses an average of only 1.8 ± 0.1 functional IP3R in its PM (∼1 IP3R/100 μm2), and no cells (from >200 recordings of native DT40 cells or those expressing recombinant IP3R) fail to express functional PM IP3R. Because DT40 cells allow expression of recombinant IP3R in cells uniquely lacking endogenous IP3R (DT40KO cells) (21Sugawara H. Kurosaki M. Takata M. Kurosaki T. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3078-3088Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar), we pursued our studies in these cells. Previous work had shown that native mouse B-cells also reliably express just 2–3 functional IP3R in the PM (10Dellis O. Dedos S. Tovey S.C. Rahman T.-U. Dubel S.J. Taylor C.W. Science. 2006; 313: 229-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). These results are surprising, first because channels are usually expressed at much higher densities (typically >100 channels/μm2, and often much higher) (12Hille B. Ionic Channels of Excitable Membranes. 3rd Ed. Sinauer Associates, Inc., Sunderland, MA2001Google Scholar), and second because for channels expressed at such low density, their numbers should follow a Poisson distribution (see supplemental Methods). We would therefore expect to find many cells without PM IP3R (Fig. 1A). Indeed, using the same cells for patch clamp recording from the nuclear envelope, which is continuous with the ER, we found 0.39 ± 0.16 IP3R in each patch (estimated recording area ∼0.8 μm2, ∼0.5 IP3R/μm2). However, in the nucleus, there are many recordings without IP3R and the numbers of IP3R/patch fit a Poisson distribution (Fig. 1B). When IP3R1 was expressed at a higher level (∼24-fold higher than native IP3R), we again detected only 2.2 ± 0.14 IP3R in the PM; their expression in the nuclear envelope was increased (to 0.7 ± 0.24/patch), but again only for nuclear IP3R was the distribution fitted by a Poisson distribution (Fig. 1, C and D). We have not extensively explored whether other cell types also count small numbers of IP3R into the PM. But under conditions similar to those used for recording from DT40 cells, we detected no IP3R in the PM of Jurkat cells (n = 15, not shown), which are derived from T cells. How do DT40 cells reliably count such small numbers of functional IP3R into the PM without failures and in the face of massively increased overexpression of intracellular IP3R? A Functional Channel Is Not Required for IP3R to be Counted into the Plasma Membrane—Ca2+ inhibits IP3R (2Foskett J.K. White C. Cheung K.H. Mak D.O. Physiol. Rev. 2007; 87: 593-658Crossref PubMed Scopus (923) Google Scholar, 22Taylor C.W. Laude A.J. Cell Calcium. 2002; 32: 321-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). We had therefore considered whether the small numbers of IP3R detected within the PM might result from silencing of inactive channels by Ca2+ passing through those that are open. However, we detect identical numbers of PM IP3R whether they are conducting K+ (as shown in Figs. 1, 2, 3 and supplemental Fig. S1) or Ba2+, which does not inhibit IP3R (22Taylor C.W. Laude A.J. Cell Calcium. 2002; 32: 321-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar), or Ca2+, which does inhibit (10Dellis O. Dedos S. Tovey S.C. Rahman T.-U. Dubel S.J. Taylor C.W. Science. 2006; 313: 229-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). It is therefore unlikely that the small number of IP3R detected in the PM results from acute silencing of a larger population of IP3RbyCa2+ passing through open channels. Instead, cells seem reliably to express ∼2 functional IP3R proteins in the PM of each cell.FIGURE 3IP3 binding is not required for IP3R to be counted into the plasma membrane.A, structure of the IP3 binding core (35Bosanac I.

Wolf D.M. Arkin A.P. Nature. 2002; 420: 231-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (801) Google Scholar). Such activity-dependent regulation is, for example, important in determining, via intracellular Ca2+ signals, the expression of inhibitory and excitatory neurotransmitter systems in developing neurons and their synaptic organization (23Borodinsky L.N. Root C.M. Cronin J.A. Sann S.B. Gu X. Spitzer N.C. Nature. 2004; 429: 523-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar, 24Spitzer N.C. Nature. 2006; 444: 707-712Crossref PubMed Scopus (568) Google Scholar). We therefore assessed whether ions passing through the IP3R might provide a feedback signal that allowed cells continuously to monitor the number of IP3R within the PM and so adjust their insertion, recycling, or activity to ensure stable expression of ∼2 functional IP3R/cell. Patch clamp recording is the only method sensitive enough to count so few IP3R (10Dellis O. Dedos S. Tovey S.C. Rahman T.-U. Dubel S.J. Taylor C.W. Science. 2006; 313: 229-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). We had therefore to ensure that IP3R were functionally inactive throughout their natural life cycle and then unmask their latent activity during patch clamp recording to measure expression levels. A mutation within the pore of the IP3R (D2550A, IP3R1DA) (Fig. 2A) satisfied these requirements. As with other “P-loop” cation channels, the selectivity filter of the tetrameric IP3R is thought to be formed by a conserved sequence (GGVGD) within the luminal loop linking the last pair of transmembrane domains (TMD 5 and 6) of each subunit (Fig. 2A). Mutations within this region affect the conductance or cation selectivity of IP3R (10Dellis O. Dedos S. Tovey S.C. Rahman T.-U. Dubel S.J. Taylor C.W. Science. 2006; 313: 229-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar, 25Boehning D. Mak D.-O.D. Foskett J.K. Joseph S.K. J. Biol.

We examined Asp-2550, which others have suggested contributes to a Ca2+-binding site within the pore (25Boehning D. Mak D.-O.D. Foskett J.K. Joseph S.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 13509-13512Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). By analogy with Ca2+-selective channels (27Sather W.A. McCleskey E.W. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2003; 65: 133-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar, 28Prakriya M. Feske S. Gwack Y. Srikanth S. Rao A. Hogan P.G.

J. 2006; 90: 443-453Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), we anticipated that disrupting this site might cause high affinity block by luminal (or extracellular) Ca2+. IP3 does not release Ca2+ from the intracellular stores of DT40 cells expressing IP3R1 with Asp-2550 mutated to Ala (DT40R1DA) (10Dellis O. Dedos S. Tovey S.C. Rahman T.-U. Dubel S.J. Taylor C.W. Science. 2006; 313: 229-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2B) nor does activation of the B-cell receptor stimulate Ca2+ entry (10Dellis O. Dedos S. Tovey S.C. Rahman T.-U. Dubel S.J. Taylor C.W. Science. 2006; 313: 229-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Such observations led us and others (25Boehning D. Mak D.-O.D. Foskett J.K. Joseph S.K. J. Biol.

Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 2323-2327Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) to conclude that IP3R1DA lacks a functional pore. Single channel analyses reveal instead that with very low extracellular Ca2+ and with K+ as charge carrier, mutant and normal PM IP3R1 have indistinguishable properties (Fig. 2, C and D and Table 1). It is therefore possible to record the activity of IP3R1DA in the PM in the absence of extracellular Ca2+. However, IP3RDA has lost its Ca2+ selectivity: with Ca2+ present in the bathing solution, its open probability (Po) and single channel conductance (γ) are significantly decreased (Fig. 2E and Table 1) and Ca2+ blocks K+ permeation more completely and with increased affinity (supplemental Fig. S2). The analogous mutation in type 1 ryanodine receptor (D4899Q) has similar effects (30Wang Y. Xu L. Pasek D.A. Gillespie D. Meissner G. Biophys. J. 2005; 89: 256-265Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), and a loss of Ca2+ selectivity was reported for the more conservative D2550E mutant of IP3R1, although this mutation incompletely attenuated IP3-evoked Ca2+ release (25Boehning D.

Tovey S.C. Dedos S. Potter B.V.L. Lummis S.C.R. Taylor C.W. Cell Calcium. 2005; 38: 45-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) is lower than in culture medium, IP3R1DA would conduct Ca2+ at ∼2% that of normal IP3R (supplemental Fig. S2). These results demonstrate that throughout its normal life history within the ER, PM, or intervening organelles (5Pinton P. Pozzan T. Rizzuto R. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5298-5308Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar), the Ca2+ (or cation)-conducting activity of IP3R1DA is massively attenuated relative to normal IP3R. However, cells reliably count just 2.0 ± 0.16 functional IP3R1-DA into the PM (Fig. 2G), just as they reliably count 2.2 ± 0.14 normal IP3R1 into the PM. We conclude that feedback signals arising from Ca2+ (or other cations) passing through IP3R are not required for cells reliably to express ∼2 functional IP3R in the PM.

Morris E.P. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2004; 29: 210-219Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). It does so by binding to the IP3 binding core (residues 224–604), within which Arg-568 and Lys-569 contact the 1-phosphate of IP3 (35Bosanac I. Alattia J.-R. Mal T.K. Chan J. Talarico S. Tong F.K. Tong K.I. Yoshikawa F. Furuichi T. Iwai M. Michikawa T. Mikoshiba K. Ikura M. Nature. 2002; 420: 696-701Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar) (Fig. 3A). Mutation of one of these key residues (R568Q, IP3R1RQ) reduces the affinity of the IP3R for IP3 by ∼10-fold (Fig. 3B) without preventing a response to a supra-maximal concentration of IP3 (Fig. 3, C and D). The expression level of IP3R1RQ was lower than that of IP3R1, such that the maximal IP3-evoked Ca2+ release was reduced from 83 ± 2 to 51 ± 3%. However, the difference in expression did not affect the sensitivity of the intracellular stores to IP3 because in both functional (Fig. 3C) and binding (Fig. 3B) assays IP3R1RQ was 10-fold less sensitive than IP3R1. Furthermore, our earlier work showed that very substantial changes in IP3R expression do not affect the number of functional IP3R expressed in the PM (10Dellis O. Dedos S. Tovey S.C. Rahman T.-U. Dubel S.J. Taylor C.W. Science. 2006; 313: 229-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). In whole-cell recordings from DT40 cells expressing IP3R1RQ, a normally maximal concentration of IP3 (10 μm) activated IP3R but with low Po, and 100 μm IP3 increased Po to the level typical of a maximally activated wild-type IP3R (Fig. 3D). At the submaximal concentrations of IP3 present within cells, IP3R1RQ would therefore be activated to only ∼10% of the level of normal IP3R. Nevertheless, we detected 2.4 ± 0.2 functional IP3RRQ in the PM of each cell; they had the usual γ (204 ± 19 picosiemens) (Fig. 3E), and as with wild-type IP3R, their distribution was inconsistent with a Poisson distribution (Fig. 3F). We conclude that even when binding of endogenous IP3 is reduced by ∼90%, cells continue reliably to express very few functional IP3R in the PM (Fig. 3F). Counting Proteins without Feedback—DT40 cells entirely lacking IP3R survive and proliferate (21Sugawara H. Kurosaki M. Takata M. Kurosaki T. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3078-3088Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar), yet the same cells when stably expressing IP3R, just as with native DT40 cells or B lymphocytes (10Dellis O. Dedos S. Tovey S.C. Rahman T.-U. Dubel S.J. Taylor C.W. Science. 2006; 313: 229-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar), reliably express ∼2 functional IP3R in the PM. Such targeting is not programmed genetically because it occurs whether IP3R are expressed under the control of endogenous or heterologous promoters, nor does feedback monitoring of IP3R activity contribute to such reliable counting because similar numbers of functional IP3R are found at the PM when either IP3 binding or channel activity are massively attenuated. The small number of IP3R invariably detected in the PM does not reflect the outcome of a selection pressure arising from a need for cells to have some PM IP3R for survival while avoiding the toxic consequences of having too many. We instead conclude that functional IP3R are reliably counted into the PM by a mechanism that does not require feedback signals from the active protein. Most IP3R are expressed in the ER, where they mediate the Ca2+ release evoked by receptors, like B-cell receptors in DT40 cells, that stimulate formation of IP3. But Ca2+ entry across the PM is also important. In DT40 cells, store-operated Ca2+ entry and PM IP3R contribute similarly to the Ca2+ signals evoked by the B-cell receptor (10Dellis O. Dedos S. Tovey S.C. Rahman T.-U. Dubel S.J. Taylor C.W. Science. 2006; 313: 229-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). We speculate that the small Ca2+ flux through each of the thousands of ICRAC (Ca2+ -release-activated current) channels that mediate store-operated Ca2+ entry and the huge Ca2+ flux through each of the very few PM IP3R may regulate different cellular responses (10Dellis O.

The typical RSK possesses six phosphorylation sites, and its in vivo activation is achieved upon their consecutive phosphorylations. Mutation analysis reveals four of the six sites are essential for the kinase activation (Ser-221 in N-terminal kinase domain, Ser-363 and Ser-380 in the linker, and Thr-573 in C-terminal kinase domain, according to the human RSK1 sequence) (3Dalby K.N.

Chem. 1998; 273: 1496-1505Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar).RSKs are present in most vertebrate species (1Hauge C. Frodin M. J. Cell Sci. 2006; 119: 3021-3023Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 4Roux P.P. Blenis J. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2004; 68: 320-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (1888) Google Scholar), and RSK-related molecules have also been identified in several invertebrates (5Wassarman D.A. Solomon N.M. Rubin G.M. Gene (Amst.). 1994; 144: 309-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 6Mori M. Hara M. Tachibana K. Kishimoto T. Development. 2006; 133: 1823-1830Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). RSK family members have been reported to be multifunctional in the regulation of diverse cellular processes including transcriptional regulation, cell cycle control, cell survival, and many others (4Roux P.P. Blenis J. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2004; 68: 320-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (1888) Google Scholar). Within mammalian cells, RSKs are thought to promote G1 progression by stimulating growth-related protein synthesis and inhibiting negative regulation (7Fujita N. Sato S. Tsuruo T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 49254-49260Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). It is, thus, shown that the RSK inhibitor SL0101 can effectively inhibit proliferations of the human breast cancer cell and the hamster ovary cell (8Smith J.A. Poteet-Smith C.E. Xu Y. Errington T.M.

Physiol. 2006; 291: C1308-C1317Crossref Scopus (19) Google Scholar).Artemia possesses powerful adaptations to extreme environments that often include aspects of hypersalinity, anoxia, and large changes in ionic composition and temperature. As a strategy to cope with such environmental stresses, Artemia has evolved a special reproductive mode in that in addition to giving birth to nauplii by the ovoviviparous pathway, this genus also releases encysted embryos by the oviparous pathway (10Slegers H. Browne R.A. Sorgeloos P. Trotman C.N.A. Artemia Biology. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL1991: 37-73Google Scholar). Released encysted embryos are developmentally arrested at the gastrula stage with a low metabolic rate and complete turnoff of replication, transcription, and translation; however, without loss of embryonic viability (11Clegg J.S. Crowe J.H. Clegg J.S. Dry Biological Systems. Academic Press, Inc., New York1978: 117-153Google Scholar, 12Drinkwater L.E. Clegg J.S. Browne R.A. Sorgeloos P. Trotman C.N.A. Artemia Biology. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL1991: 93-117Google Scholar).Another interesting phenomenon in the development of Artemia-encysted embryos is that no cell division or DNA synthesis occurs before emergence (13Nakanishi Y.H. Iwasaki T. Okigaki T. Kato H. Annot. Zool. Jpn. 1962; 35: 223-228Google Scholar, 14Nakanishi Y.H. Okigaki T. Kato H. Iwasaki T. Proc. Jpn. Acad. 1963; 39: 306-309Crossref Google Scholar). In the emergence process, the prenauplius starts to push out of the cyst shell, and finally, it develops into a true swimming nauplius. During preemergence development, the number of nuclei remains at about 4000 per embryo (15Olson C.S. Clegg J.S. Experientia (Basel). 1976; 32: 864-865Crossref Scopus (9) Google Scholar) despite the great number of internal events including deposited energy mobilization, RNA and protein synthesis restoration, cellular differentiation, and associated morphological changes required for the development from gastrula to prenauplius (16Finamore F.J. Clegg J.S. Padilla G.M. Whitson G.L. Cameron I.L. The Cell Cycle: Gene-Enzyme Interactions. Academic Press, Inc., New York1969: 249-278Google Scholar, 17Hentschel C.C. Tata J.R. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1976; 1: 97-100Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (6) Google Scholar). The mechanism of this unusual developmental pattern is still unclear. It is considered that the absence of cell division during the early embryonic development of Artemia is an adaptation to environmental threats, which confer on embryos their amazing stability and viability (18Clegg J.S. Trotman C.N.A. Abatzopoulos T.J. Beardmore J.A. Clegg J.S. Sorgeloos P. Artemia: Basic and Applied Biology. Kluwer Academic Publishers, Dordrecht, Netherlands2002: 129-170Google Scholar).In the present study Artemia RSK was established to be specifically activated at the very beginning of emergence and was coupled with mitogenesis during the post-embryonic and early larval developmental stages. In vivo knockdown of RSK activity consistently induced abnormal individuals with distinct gaps between the exoskeleton and the internal tissues in the developing thoracic and abdominal regions. By 5-bromo-2′-deoxyuridine (BrdUrd) labeling and mitotic index analysis, mitoses were detected to be largely inhibited in those affected segments. Our findings, thus, indicate that RSK is involved in the termination of cell cycle (G2/M phase) arrest and the promotion of mitogenesis during the post-embryonic development of Artemia-encysted embryos.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESAnimals—Postdiapause embryos of Artemia parthenogenetica of Gahai were incubated in 2.5% artificial seawater (Blue Starfish, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, China) at 28 °C with continuous light after hydration at 4 °C for 5 h; swimming nauplii were cultured in 7% artificial seawater at 25 °C with a 16-h light cycle per day. After ovulation, 30% of the adult females were maintained in the same condition for producing nondiapause embryos. The other 70% were transferred to another culture condition with a 5-h light cycle per day for producing encysted embryos. Half of the gathered encysted embryos was stored at 15 °C as a sample set of diapause embryos, and the other half was dehydrated in saturated sodium chloride solution for 24 h and then stored at -20 °C to prepare a sample set of postdiapause embryos.Molecular Cloning of RSK Encoding cDNA—The first-strand cDNAs were reverse-transcribed from the messenger RNAs of postdiapause embryos as described by Dai et al. (19Dai Z.M. Zhu X.J. Chen Q. Yang W.J. J. Biotechnol. 2007; 128: 435-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). The RSK-encoding cDNA fragment was obtained through two rounds of PCR amplifications using degenerate primers (DF1, DF2, and DR in Table 1). Afterward, 3′ and 5′ rapid amplification of cDNA ends (3′- and 5′-RACE) were performed with gene-specific primers (F1, F2, R1, and R2 in Table 1) to achieve the full-length cDNA using the FirstChoice™ RLM-RACE kit (Ambion). Both the sequenced cDNA and the deduced peptide were analyzed by DNAStar, and Blast was performed using the NCBI website. The nucleotide sequence of this RSK encoding cDNA was submitted to GenBank™ under the accession number EF427895.TABLE 1Nucleotide sequences and positions of primers used in polymerase chain reactionsPrimerLengthPositionDirectionSequence (5′-3′)bpDF123847-869FGTNYTNATGTWYGARATGYTNACDF2231696-1718FGTNGTNCAYMGNGAYYTNAARCCDR231834-1856RACYTCNGGNGCNACRWARTTNGCF1241720-1743FGAAAATATTCTATTCGCCACTGAAF2241756-1779FCCAACTTTGAGGCTTTGCGACTTTR1242438-2461RCCTTTGGCTGCTCAATTTTACACAR2232395-2417RACACTGTCCAGGGGGCTTTTCTAR3211860-1880RGCGTCATAGCCCTGTTTCTTTiF23268-290FGCAGAGTCATCTCATTTTGAGTTiR20421-440RCCTCTCTCCATTTTGGTCCGsiF28738-760FGCTCTAGATACCGAGTCCAAATCATACAsiR291292-1313RGGAATTCAATGAACTGACATCGTTACCATTublinF20FGCAGTGGTCTACAAGGTTTCTublinR22RATCAAAACGAAGGCTGGCGGTG18 S F22FGAAGCACTCTCTACCCTTCCTG18 S R25RATTCACACGTAGAAAATATACATCG Open table in a new tab Semiquantitative Reverse Transcription-PCR—First-strand cDNAs of each sample were synthesized from 2 μg of total RNA using the SuperScript™/First-Strand cDNA Synthesis kit (Invitrogen). 2 μl of reverse transcription products were used as the PCR templates, and both the RSK cDNA fragment and the constitutively expressed α-tubulin cDNA fragment (Gen-Bank™ accession number AF427598) were simultaneously amplified in a 25-μl reaction containing 10 pmol of F2 and R3 (Table 1) and 2 pmol of tubulinF and tubulinR (Table 1). Relative abundances were expressed as RSK transcript levels to those of α-tubulin. In each case peak values were set to 100, and the rest of the values were normalized. All data were given as the means ± S.E. of independent experiments from three separate RNA pools. All statistical analyses were performed using the one-way ANOVA, and the differences were considered significance for p < 0.01.Western Blotting—Proteins were extracted from each sample using the TRIZOL reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions and were quantified using the Bradford method (20Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (213377) Google Scholar). 50 μg of proteins of each sample were separated on 10% SDS-PAGE and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore). The membranes were incubated with anti-phospho-RSK antibody (phospho-p90RSK (Ser-380) antibody, Cell Signaling Technology, 1:1000) or anti-RSK antibody (rabbit anti-pan RSK antibody, R&D Systems, 0.5 μg/ml) overnight at 4 °C, and the detection was performed using the BM Chemiluminescence Western blotting kit (Roche Applied Science).Immunohistochemistry—Decapsulated (treated by 3% sodium hypochlorite solution) embryos and nauplii were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde and paraffin-embedded. 5-μm-thick sections were incubated with the anti-phospho-RSK antibody (1:100) or anti-RSK antibody (5 μg/ml) overnight at 4 °C and subsequently incubated with the alkaline phosphatase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG secondary antibody (1:200, Promega). The staining was performed using the nitro blue tetrazolium/5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate solution in the dark.Analysis of Cell Division and Cell Cycle Phase—Cells from embryos and shrimp were collected by crushing, trypsinization (0.25% trypsin, 37 °C), washing, and suspension in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (137 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 10 mm Na2HPO4.12H2O, 1.76 mm KH2PO4, pH 7.4) and fixed in 70% ethanol at 4 °C.For nuclear morphological analysis cells were stained with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenyindole dilactate (Sigma). For each sample, quintuplicate against three preparations of cell suspension were performed, and more than 20,000 cells were observed.For flow cytometry analysis, fixed cells were incubated with RNase A (100 μg/ml, Sigma) for 30 min at 37 °C and stained with propidium iodine (50 μg/ml, Sigma) for 30 min at 4 °C. Analysis of DNA content and cell cycle phase was performed using the BD FACSCalibur fluorescence-activated cell analyzer. For each sample duplicates of three preparations of cell suspension were performed, and results were analyzed using Cell Quest™ software version 3.1 (BD Biosciences). All data were given as the mean ± S.E., and all statistical analyses were performed using the one-way ANOVA. The differences were considered significance for p < 0.01.Double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) Preparation for RNA Interference (RNAi)—Two oligos (5′-AGCTTGGAATTGTTATCCGCTCACAATTCCCCTATAGTGAGTCGTATTA-3′ and 5′-TCGATAATACGACTCACTATAGGGGAATTGTGAGCGGATAACAATTCCA-3′, 10 μm each) were mixed together in TN buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 8.0, and 10 mm NaCl), heated at 70 °C for 2 min, and then cooled down slowly to room temperature. The annealed product was subcloned into pET-32a (Novagen) at HindIII and XhoI sites. Subsequently the obtained plasmid (named as pET-T7), which contains two inverted T7 polymerase sites flanking the cloning region, was used as the dsRNA expression vector. To construct the recombinant plasmid expressing dsRNA of Artemia RSK (named as pET-T7-RSK), a 576-bp cDNA fragment in the coding region of the RSK gene was amplified by PCR with primers siF and siR (Table 1), excised, and subcloned into pET-T7 at XbaI and EcoRI sites. All plasmid constructions and propagations were performed in Escherichia coli DH5α. Nucleotide sequences of the recombinant plasmids were confirmed by DNA sequencing. Both the recombinant plasmids of pET-T7-RSK and pET-T7 (as a control) were transformed into E. coli HT115, and the dsRNAs were produced and purified as described by Yodmuang et al. (21Yodmuang S. Tirasophon W. Roshorm Y. Chinnirunvong W. Panyim S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2006; 341: 351-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar).Embryonic Microinjection—Artemia embryonic microinjections were performed with decapsulated embryos using the UltraMicroPump II equipped with the Micro4™ MicroSyringe Pump Controller.For RNAi, each postdiapause embryo was injected with 5 ng of RSK dsRNA or control dsRNA. For kinase inhibition, each 6-h-incubated embryo was injected with 2.3 nl of 1 mm RSK inhibitor SL0101 (Toronto Research Chemicals, Inc.) or an equal volume of Me2SO (control). For antibody neutralization, each 6-h-incubated embryo was injected with 2.3 nl of anti-phospho-RSK antibody or an equal volume of antibody storage buffer (control, 10 mm sodium HEPES, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 50% glycerol). Injected embryos were incubated in 2.5% artificial seawater at 28 °C with continuous light, and the hatched nauplii were examined and categorized every 12 h.Real-time PCR—Total RNAs from controls or phenotypically affected RSK-RNAi Artemia of comparable developmental stage were isolated using the RNAqueous®-Micro kit (Ambion). After reverse transcription, all real-time PCR reactions were performed on the Bio-Rad MiniOpticon™ real-time PCR system using the SYBR®Premix Ex Taq™ (TaKaRa Bio, Inc.) and 200 nm concentrations of each specific primer (iF/iR and 18 S F/18SRin Table 1). Relative transcript levels were presented as -fold change calculated using the comparative CT method as described by Livak and Schmittgen (22Livak K.J. Schmittgen T.D. Methods. 2001; 25: 402-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (119255) Google Scholar) with 18 S rRNA (GenBank™ accession number DQ201283) as the internal reference. All data were given as the means ± S.E. of independent experiments from three separate RNA pools. All statistical analyses were performed using the one-way ANOVA, and the difference was considered significance for p < 0.01.Measurement of Mitosis by BrdUrd Labeling and Detection—Microinjected embryos were incubated with 1 mm BrdUrd (Sigma) in 2.5% artificial seawater, and the hatched nauplii were still cultured in this medium. Labeled embryos and nauplii were fixed, frozen, and cut into 6-μm-thick sections in a cryostat. Sections were incubated with the monoclonal anti-BrdUrd antibody (1:100, Sigma) overnight at 4 °C and subsequently incubated with the anti-mouse IgG-POD antibody (1:250, Roche Applied Science). The staining was performed using the DAB kit (Boster, Wuhan, Hubei, China).RESULTSIdentification of RSK Encoding cDNA in Artemia—To investigate the role of RSK during the embryonic development of Artemia, a 2474-bp cDNA encoding RSK was isolated from the postdiapause embryos of A. parthenogenetica of Gahai. Sequence analysis reveals the cDNA contains an open reading frame encoding a protein of 714 amino acids, with a predicted mass of 81.3 kDa. The deduced amino acid sequence of this protein is similar to those of other RSK family members. Comparison results show 61% sequence identities with frog, mouse, and human RSK2, 61% with mouse and human RSK1, 60% with mouse and human RSK3, and 46% with mouse and human RSK4. Phylogenetic analysis suggests that Artemia RSK can be grouped with the RSK of another arthropod Drosophila melanogaster (59% sequence identity).The deduced amino acid sequence shows that Artemia RSK consists of two distinct kinase domains, the N-terminal kinase domain and the C-terminal kinase domain, joined by a linker region. The whole protein contains five RSK typical phosphorylation sites (Ser-218, Thr-359, Ser-363, Ser-380, and Thr-571, shown in Fig. 1) which were identified according to the RSK consensus phosphorylation sites (1Hauge C. Frodin M. J. Cell Sci. 2006; 119: 3021-3023Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 4Roux P.P. Blenis J. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2004; 68: 320-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (1888) Google Scholar). It also displays a special sequence (Leu-Lys-Arg-Arg) in the region from position 673 to 676 that is thought to be necessary for extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK).RSK Expression and Activation during Embryonic and Larval Developmental Stages—Northern blot analysis using 20 μg of total RNA did not detect the transcript; therefore, semiquantitative reverse transcription-PCR was performed to characterize the expression pattern of RSK gene. The results show that the RSK transcript is universally expressed throughout the whole life cycle of Artemia (from diapause or nondiapause embryos through to adults with diapause or nondiapause embryos), and no significant expression fluctuations were observed among different stages (data not shown).The activation of RSK during the embryonic and larval development processes was analyzed by Western blotting using the phospho-p90RSK (Ser380) antibody, which has been widely used to detect the endogenous activated p90RSK (23Majka M. Janowska-Wieczorek A. Ratajczak J. Kowalska M.A. Vilaire G. Pan Z.K. Honczarenko M. Marquez L.A. Poncz M. Ratajczak M.Z. Blood. 2000; 96: 4142-4151Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 24Tomas-Zuber M.

The results (Fig. 2) show that RSK is abruptly activated in the 12-h-incubated embryo. Subsequently the phospho-RSK level increases in both the 14-h-incubated embryo and the newly hatched nauplius. During larval development, the phospho-RSK level decreases at the metanauplius stage, and no signal was detected in the postlarva or adults. In contrast, total RSK could be detected at as early a stage as in the diapause embryo, and it subsequently kept relatively constant after developmental resumption (Fig. 2). Immunohistochemical analysis also illustrates that in the emerging embryo (12-h-incubated) most phospho-RSK is located in the endoderm and in the nauplius signals can be detected throughout the whole body covering endoderm, mesoderm, and ectoderm (Fig. 3).FIGURE 2RSK activation during developmental stages of Artemia. RSK level was detected by Western blotting with anti-phospho-RSK antibody or anti-RSK antibody during embryonic development (including the nondiapause embryo, the diapause embryo, the postdiapause embryo, and the 2-14-h-incubated embryos) and larval development (including the nauplius, the metanauplius, the postlarva, the female adult without eggs (FANE), the female adult with white eggs (FAWE), the female adult with diapause embryos (FADE), and the female adult with nondiapause embryos (FANDE)).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)FIGURE 3Location of active RSK in the emerging embryo and the nauplius of Artemia. Decapsulated embryos and nauplii were fixed and paraffin-embedded.

Fig. 4, a-i) show the developmental stages from the postdiapause embryo through to the postlarva. Here we show clearly observable internal differentiation in the 8-h-incubated embryo, prenauplius emergence in the 12-h-incubated embryo, a pear-shaped prenauplius totally escaping from the cyst shell after 14 h of incubation, and the adult form almost achieved at the postlarval stage.FIGURE 4Morphology and cell division during the embryonic and larval developmental stages of Artemia. Decapsulated (a-d) and emerged (e and f) embryos and shrimp (g-i) were fixed and examined by light microscopy, and cells of each stage were stained with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenyindole dilactate and examined by fluorescence microscopy (a′-i′). Dividing cells are labeled with asterisks (*). Magnified images of dividing cells (under both the fluorescence and the phase contrast conditions) are also shown (j′).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The nuclear morphological observation of cells of each stage (Fig. 4, a′-i′) reveals that there is no observable cell division during preemergence development (postdiapause, 4-h-, 8-h-, and 10-h-incubated), that rare cells divide (at a rate of under 1%) at the beginning of emergence (12-h- and 14-h-incubated), and that the mitosis becomes active after the swimming nauplius formation (when ∼3% of cells are mitotic) and becomes further increased (observed at >15%) at the metanauplius stage.The DNA content and cell cycle phase of each stage was identified by flow cytometry analysis. Five representative stages were analyzed, namely (i) postdiapause, (ii) before emergence (10-hour-incubated), (iii) after emergence (14-h-incubated), (iv) newly hatched nauplius, and (v) postlarval stage. Due to the ubiquitous heteroploidies and aneuploidies in Artemia (14Nakanishi Y.H. Okigaki T. Kato H. Iwasaki T. Proc. Jpn. Acad. 1963; 39: 306-309Crossref Google Scholar, 26Gajardo G.

The results (Fig. 5) show that at the preemergence developmental stages (postdiapause and 10-h-incubated) total DNA content seems to be the highest compared with that of other stages analyzed, most events being in the G2/M region. After emergence (14-h-incubated and nauplius), the DNA content is still maintained at a relatively high level; however, more events fall into the G0/G1 region. In the postlarva, total DNA content is much lower, and a large number of events are in the G0/G1 region. These results confirm that RSK activation occurs at the very beginning of emergence and is coupled with the termination of G2/M-phase arrest and mitogenesis.FIGURE 5Analysis of DNA content and cell cycle phase in encysted embryos and larvae of different stages. Flow cytometry analysis was performed with fixed cell suspension at each stage. Two parameters were analyzed, the Geo mean of DNA content with total events and the ratio of M2 events/M1 events (M2 was defined as a G2/M region and M1 as a G0/G1 region), and all data are given as the means ± S.E. An asterisk (*) indicates a significant difference (p < 0.01), analyzed using the one-way ANOVA, between each of the different sample groups and the standard group of the postdiapause embryo.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)In Vivo Knockdown of RSK Activity in Artemia—Embryonic RNAi was performed by dsRNA microinjection, which has been successfully applied in Artemia (27Copf T.

The observation results show that up to 20% of the surviving individuals injected with RSK dsRNA display severe phenotypes, whereas control groups display no such abnormalities. The majority of these abnormal Artemia, especially at the metanauplius stage, have defects in the developing thoracic and abdominal regions to various degrees (Fig. 6A). In these segments, either partial sections or the entire internal cell layers are much thinner than those of normal individuals, resulting in the formation of areas of distinct gaps between the chitin exoskeleton and the internal tissues. In addition, some other phenotypes (such as the shortening of the antenna, the expod, or the swimming setae) were also observed, although in much smaller numbers (data not shown).

Here we report construction of a human p53 knock-in (Hupki) mouse encoding the codon 72pro variant. The new strain was crossed with the original Hupki mice (codon 72arg/arg) to obtain primary embryonic fibroblasts polymorphic at codon 72 or homozygous for codon 72pro. The fibroblasts, cultured under standard conditions, immortalized within 12 weeks and acquired p53 mutations similarly to Hupki codon 72arg/arg cells investigated previously. Sequencing of human p53 exons 4–9 in immortalized cultures revealed missense mutations found repeatedly in human tumours. In cell lines ensuing from benzo(a)pyrene-treated cultures the combined p53 mutation pattern from experiments with the 3 codon 72 genotypes showed a predominance of strand-biased G to T transversions (18 of 36 mutations), and mutations recurring at smokers' lung tumour hotspot codons 157 and 273, supporting involvement of tobacco carcinogens in shaping the mutation signature in lung cancers of smokers. Mutations in cell lines from unexposed cultures did not cluster at these codons and G to T transversions were uncommon (2 of 52 mutations) (Fisher's exact test P<0.0001). Most mutations (13/16) in cell lines derived from cells polymorphic at codon 72 were found on the proline allele, with loss of the arginine allele."
https://openalex.org/W2087171142,"CheZ catalyzes the dephosphorylation of the response regulator CheY in the two-component regulatory system that mediates chemotaxis in Escherichia coli. CheZ is a homodimer with two active sites for dephosphorylation. To gain insight into cellular mechanisms for the precise regulation of intracellular phosphorylated CheY (CheYp) levels, we evaluated the kinetic properties of CheZ. The steady state rate of CheZ-mediated dephosphorylation of CheYp displayed marked sigmoidicity with respect to CheYp concentration and a kcat of 4.9 s–1. In contrast, the gain of function mutant CheZ-I21T with an amino acid substitution far from the active site gave hyperbolic kinetics and required far lower CheYp for half-saturation but had a similar kcat value as the wild type enzyme. Stopped flow fluorescence measurements demonstrated a 6-fold faster CheZ/CheYp association rate for CheZ-I21T (kassoc = 3.4 × 107m–1 s–1) relative to wild type CheZ (kassoc = 5.6 × 106m–1 s–1). Dissociation of the CheZ·CheYBeF3 complex was slow for both wild type CheZ (kdissoc = 0.040 s–1) and CheZ-I21T (kdissoc = 0.023 s–1) and, when taken with the kassoc values, implied Kd values of 7.1 and 0.68 nm, respectively. However, comparison of the kdissoc and kcat values implied that CheZ and CheYp are not at binding equilibrium during catalysis and that once CheYp binds, it is almost always dephosphorylated. The rate constants were collated to formulate a kinetic model for CheZ-mediated dephosphorylation that includes autoregulation by CheYp and allowed prediction of CheZ activities at CheZ and CheYp concentrations likely to be present in cells. CheZ catalyzes the dephosphorylation of the response regulator CheY in the two-component regulatory system that mediates chemotaxis in Escherichia coli. CheZ is a homodimer with two active sites for dephosphorylation. To gain insight into cellular mechanisms for the precise regulation of intracellular phosphorylated CheY (CheYp) levels, we evaluated the kinetic properties of CheZ. The steady state rate of CheZ-mediated dephosphorylation of CheYp displayed marked sigmoidicity with respect to CheYp concentration and a kcat of 4.9 s–1. In contrast, the gain of function mutant CheZ-I21T with an amino acid substitution far from the active site gave hyperbolic kinetics and required far lower CheYp for half-saturation but had a similar kcat value as the wild type enzyme. Stopped flow fluorescence measurements demonstrated a 6-fold faster CheZ/CheYp association rate for CheZ-I21T (kassoc = 3.4 × 107m–1 s–1) relative to wild type CheZ (kassoc = 5.6 × 106m–1 s–1). Dissociation of the CheZ·CheYBeF3 complex was slow for both wild type CheZ (kdissoc = 0.040 s–1) and CheZ-I21T (kdissoc = 0.023 s–1) and, when taken with the kassoc values, implied Kd values of 7.1 and 0.68 nm, respectively. However, comparison of the kdissoc and kcat values implied that CheZ and CheYp are not at binding equilibrium during catalysis and that once CheYp binds, it is almost always dephosphorylated. The rate constants were collated to formulate a kinetic model for CheZ-mediated dephosphorylation that includes autoregulation by CheYp and allowed prediction of CheZ activities at CheZ and CheYp concentrations likely to be present in cells. In the two-component regulatory system that mediates chemotaxis in Escherichia coli, the cell continuously regulates the level of phosphorylation of the response regulator CheY in response to an external chemical gradient (1Wadhams G.H.

CheYp binds to the base of the flagellum, thereby changing the direction of flagellar rotation from counterclockwise (causing a forward run) to clockwise (causing a reorienting tumble). Because cells switch rapidly between these two swimming behaviors as they sample their environment (5Turner L. Ryu W.S. Berg H.C. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 2793-2801Crossref PubMed Scopus (546) Google Scholar, 6Berg H.C. Brown D.A. Nature. 1972; 239: 500-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (1509) Google Scholar), it is essential that both phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of CheY occur on a rapid time scale so that the concentration of CheYp at any instant accurately reflects current environmental conditions. Moreover, the highly cooperative relationship between intracellular CheYp concentration and the probability of clockwise rotation (7Cluzel P. Surette M. Leibler S. Science. 2000; 287: 1652-1655Crossref PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar) underscores the necessity of precise regulation of CheYp levels. CheY is phosphorylated on Asp-57 by its cognate sensor kinase CheA at a rate that is dictated by the rate of autophosphorylation of CheA with ATP, which in turn is a function of the activity state of coupled transmembrane receptors. CheYp is dephosphorylated by the phosphatase CheZ. The ability to perform chemotaxis is very sensitive to intracellular CheZ activity as either a modest increase or decrease of CheZ activity disables chemotaxis (8Boesch K.C. Silversmith R.E. Bourret R.B. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 3544-3552Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 9Sanna M.G. Simon M.I. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 6275-6280Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10Lovdok L.

Much of the cellular pool of CheZ is associated with the large polar signaling complex (13Cantwell B.J. Draheim R.R. Weart R.B. Nguyen C. Stewart R.C. Manson M.D. J. Bacteriol. 2003; 185: 2354-2361Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 14Sourjik V. Berg H.C. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 37: 740-751Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar, 15Vaknin A. Berg H.C.

Colocalization of CheZ with the CheA kinase implies some futile cycling of CheY but ensures a uniform concentration of CheYp across the length of the cell (15Vaknin A. Berg H.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 17072-17077Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 16Rao C.V. Kirby J.R. Arkin A.P. Phys. Biol. 2005; 2: 148-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 17Lipkow K.

CheZ is unrelated by amino acid sequence to other known classes of protein phosphatases and has a unique catalytic mechanism based on the introduction of additional catalytic elements into the CheYp active site for CheYp autodephosphorylation activity. CheZ is a homodimer with two CheYp binding sites, each binding site being composed of two independent surfaces from different domains of CheZ2 (Fig. 1 (18Zhao R. Collins E.J. Bourret R.B. Silversmith R.E. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2002; 9: 570-575PubMed Google Scholar)). The dominant domain of CheZ2 is a long four-helix bundle composed of a helical hairpin from each monomer with additional angled N-terminal helices at the non-hairpin end of the bundle. The C terminus of each hairpin extends with a 32-residue flexible linker followed by a final amphipathic C-terminal α helix (C-helix). Like all response regulators, CheY has a β5α5 fold with the phosphorylated aspartate located within a highly conserved active site adjacent to a bound Mg2+ ion (19Lee S.Y. Cho H.S. Pelton J.G. Yan D. Henderson R.K. King D.S. Huang L. Kustu S. Berry E.A. Wemmer D.E. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 52-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar), essential for catalysis of all phosphotransfer events (20Lukat G.S. Stock A.M. Stock J.B. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 5436-5442Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). In one interaction surface between CheY and CheZ, the α4β5α5 surface of CheY binds to the hydrophobic face of the CheZ C-helix. In the other interaction the active site region on CheY interacts with a surface near the center of the four-helix bundle of CheZ. Within the latter interaction surface, the essential catalytic residue Gln-147 from CheZ inserts into the CheY active site and is positioned to interact with a water molecule for in-line nucleophilic attack of the phosphoryl group, the same mechanism that has been proposed for CheY autodephosphorylation (21Stock A.M. Martinez-Hackert E. Rasmussen B.F. West A.H. Stock J.B. Ringe D. Petsko G.A. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 13375-13380Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). Although the catalytic roles of the CheZ C-helix and the central region of the four-helix bundle have been elucidated, the function of the N-terminal helices and the non-hairpin region of the bundle is still not understood. However, there is some evidence that this region may be involved in regulation of CheZ activity. Many of the CheZ mutants that display a “gain of function” phenotype (Che–, CCW flagellar rotation) (9Sanna M.G. Simon M.I. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 6275-6280Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11Huang C. Stewart R.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1202: 297-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) map to this region of CheZ, which is distal from the characterized catalytic surfaces. Several of the gain of function mutants display modest (2–5×) enhancements of CheZ activity when tested in a gel-based assay monitoring the loss of radioactivity from [32P]CheYp (9Sanna M.G. Simon M.I. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 6275-6280Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11Huang C. Stewart R.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1202: 297-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Analysis of presteady state time courses that monitor the CheZ-induced shift in the equilibrium between CheYp and CheY suggested that CheZ catalytic activity exhibits positive cooperativity with respect to CheYp concentration. In contrast, the gain of function mutant CheZ-R54C displays enhanced phosphatase activity at low CheYp concentrations, suggesting that the substitution resulted in a constitutively activated state (22Blat Y. Gillespie B. Bren A. Dahlquist F.W. Eisenbach M. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 284: 1191-1199Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). These observations suggest CheZ activity might be regulated in a manner that could potentially play an important role in control of CheYp levels in the cell. Here, we further explore the fundamental kinetic properties of catalysis by CheZ to acquire a more quantitative understanding of CheZ activity and possible regulation. With a standard enzymological approach, we measured CheZ catalytic activity at steady state as a function of substrate (CheYp) concentration to assess the presence of regulation by CheYp and determine kinetic constants. To complement the enzymology, we characterized the kinetics of association and dissociation of the CheZ·CheYp complex using CheYp-dependent fluorescence changes in CheZ covalently labeled with the badan fluorophore. Results from measurements made on both wild type CheZ and the gain of function mutant CheZ-I21T were combined to formulate a kinetic model for CheZ-mediated dephosphorylation that includes positive cooperativity with respect to CheYp. The model was used in computer simulations to predict CheZ activities at concentrations of CheZ and CheYp present in the cell. Site-directed Mutagenesis and Protein Purification—The mutants cheZ-I21T and cheZ-I21T/F214C were constructed using the QuikChange mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) by introduction of the codon for Thr-21 into a pRS3 plasmid encoding either wild type CheZ or CheZ-F214C (8Boesch K.C. Silversmith R.E. Bourret R.B. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 3544-3552Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Purification of CheZ (wild type and CheZ-I21T, -F214C, or -I21T/F214C) was carried out according to published procedures (23Silversmith R.E. Smith J.G. Guanga G.P. Les J.T. Bourret R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 18478-18484Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) with 2 mm dithiothreitol present during purification of CheZ proteins containing the cysteine substitution at position 214. Unlike wild type CheZ and CheZ-I21T, both CheZ-F214C and CheZ-I21T/F214C exhibited detectable proteolysis of the C-terminal 42 residues (8Boesch K.C. Silversmith R.E. Bourret R.B. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 3544-3552Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) after the standard purification procedure. These proteins were, therefore, subjected to an additional high resolution ion exchange step (Mono Q, GE Biosciences), which separated full-length from proteolyzed CheZ2 (24Silversmith R.E. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 7768-7776Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). CheY (wild type, N23D, N59R, and A113P) was purified according to published procedures (25Hess J.F. Bourret R.B. Simon M.I. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 200: 188-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Kinetics of CheZ-catalyzed Dephosphorylation of CheY—The rate of dephosphorylation of CheY in the presence or absence of CheZ was measured using the EnzChek Pi assay (Invitrogen) adapted to a 96-well plate format from a previously described cuvette based assay (23Silversmith R.E. Smith J.G. Guanga G.P. Les J.T. Bourret R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 18478-18484Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Wild type CheY was mixed with wild type CheZ (0, 50 nm, or 3.0 μm) in a total volume of 46 μl in buffer containing 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.0, 10 mm MgCl2, and 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin in a flat-bottomed polyethylene 96-well plate. At 30-s intervals, 4 μl of 50 mm monophosphoimidazole (MPI; synthesized according to Rathlev and Rosenberg (26Rathlev T. Rosenberg T. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1956; 65: 319-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar)) was added and mixed by repetitive pipetting to give a final concentration of 4 mm MPI. After the designated reaction time (22–30 min at room temperature), the reactions were quenched with 150 μl of a solution containing 250 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 25 mm EDTA, 310 μm 2-amino-6-mercapto-7-methylpurine riboside and 1.4 units/ml purine nucleoside phosphorylase. The high EDTA concentration stops both phosphorylation and dephosphorylation reactions, and the assay kit components 2-amino-6-mercapto-7-methylpurine riboside and purine nucleoside phosphorylase convert the Pi into a product with a detectable absorbance. After 15 min of incubation, the absorbances at 360 nm were read with a plate reader (Molecular Devices SpectraMax M2e). The absorbance values were converted into Pi release rates (μm Pi/s) using an empirically determined extinction coefficient derived from a standard Pi curve. All rates were corrected for the small amount of background Pi (introduced from the MPI preparations) deduced from controls lacking CheY. Preliminary experiments demonstrated that the rates were linear for at least 1 h. For experiments comparing the activities of wild type CheZ and CheZ-I21T, CheY-A113P was used as the substrate due to its enhanced autophosphorylation rate (27Smith J.G. Latiolais J.A. Guanga G.P. Pennington J.D. Silversmith R.E. Bourret R.B. Mol. Microbiol. 2004; 51: 887-901Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). This was manifested in higher rates of Pi release in the presence of excess CheZ, which allowed a larger range of dephosphorylation rate measurements at low CheYp concentrations. For a subset of the enzyme kinetic experiments, duplicates of each reaction condition were included, and the absorbance values were averaged. In these cases the duplicates were in excellent agreement, and use of the averaged values did not significantly affect the curve fit to the data relative to using single readings. Therefore, for most of the experiments, single reactions of each CheZ/CheY concentration condition were used to limit the number of samples so that the reactions could be quenched within 30 min. The results of multiple (three or four) independent experiments for each CheZ and CheY combination were averaged to get the final kinetic values. To measure time courses, reactions were scaled up in volume keeping all components at the same concentrations used in the single time point analysis. After initiation of the reaction by the addition of monophosphoimidazole, 50-μl aliquots were removed at various times, placed in a new well of the microtiter plate, and assayed for Pi as described above. For analysis of the dephosphorylation rate data, consideration was made of the following equilibrium, CheYfree⇄kdephosphkphosphCheYp(Eq. 1) where kphosph is the pseudo-first order rate constant for phosphorylation at 4 mm MPI, and kdephosph is the first order rate constant for dephosphorylation. First, kphosph was determined using the slope of the linear relationship between the rate of Pi release and CheY concentration in the presence of excess CheZ (3 μm). Under these conditions, dephosphorylation occurs rapidly, so that CheY is mostly unphosphorylated (CheYfree), and the measured rate of Pi release = kphosph(CheYtotal)(i.e. phosphorylation is rate-limiting). Next, the concentration of CheYp present at steady state for each sample was calculated using the following relationships derived from Equation 1. [CheYfree]×kphosph=[CheYp]×kdephosph=rateofPirelease(Eq. 2) Solving for [CheYfree], [CheYfree]=rateofPirelease/kphosph,(Eq. 3) and [CheYp]=[CheYtotal]-[CheYfree].(Eq. 4) Finally, the rate of Pi release due only to CheZ was determined for each data point by subtracting the amount of Pi release expected in the absence of CheZ (derived from the linear relationship between Pi release and CheYp concentration in the absence of CheZ) from the Pi release rate in the presence of CheZ. The data were fit using nonlinear regression (Prism software) directly to the Hill equation v=Vmax[CheYp]n/(K0.5n+[CheYp]n)(Eq. 5) with Vmax, K0.5 (the concentration of CheYp necessary for half-maximal velocity), and n (the Hill coefficient) as floating variables. Labeling CheZ with the Badan Fluorophore—Fractions from the Mono Q salt gradient elution that contained only full-length CheZ-F214C or CheZ-I21T/F214C were pooled and immediately supplemented with 1 mm tris-2-carboxyethyl phosphine hydrochloride (Pierce) to keep Cys-214 reduced. The badan (6-bromoacetyl-2-dimethylaminonaphthalene; Invitrogen) was prepared fresh as a 25 mm stock solution in dimethylformamide. The badan solution was added to the CheZ (100 μm) in 5 equal aliquots at 5-min intervals while stirring to give a final concentration of 1 mm badan. The reaction was placed in the dark for 2 h at room temperature, quenched by the addition of 10 mm dithiothreitol, and clarified by centrifugation to remove a small amount of insoluble matter generated during the reaction. The clarified sample was then chromatographed on G-75 Sephadex in 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 0.5 mm EDTA, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 2 mm dithiothreitol to separate the badan-labeled CheZ from unreacted badan. The protein concentration of badan-labeled CheZ (*B-CheZ or *B-CheZ-I21T) was determined using a Bradford assay (Bio-Rad protein assay kit) with unlabeled CheZ as a standard. The concentration of badan in the labeled protein was determined by the absorbance at 392 nm (ϵ = 12.9 mm–1 cm–1) (28Boxrud P.D. Fay W.P. Bock P.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 14579-14589Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Labeling ratios were 1.2 and 0.7 mol/mol for *B-CheZ and *B-CheZ-I21T, respectively. Fluorescence Measurements—Steady state fluorescence measurements of *B-CheZ or *B-CheZ-I21T were made on a PerkinElmer Life Sciences LS-50B spectrofluorimeter with a circulating water bath to maintain cuvette temperature at 20 °C. For emission scans, the excitation wavelength was 392 nm, and the emission was scanned from 400 to 600 nm. For time courses and equilibrium titrations, the excitation wavelength was 392 nm, and the emission wavelength was 500 nm for *B-CheZ and 470 nm for *B-CheZ-I21T. Excitation and emission slit widths were adjusted to optimize the signal/noise ratio. For equilibrium titration of *B-CheZ or *B-CheZ-I21T with CheYBeF3 or CheY-N23DBeF3, badan-CheZ was diluted to 0.1 μm in buffer containing 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.0, 10 mm MgCl2, 10 mm NaF, and 0.1 mm BeCl2. Repetitive additions of small volumes of CheY were made, and the fluorescence was monitored continuously. Subsequent additions were made only after the fluorescence had stabilized as a result of the previous addition. The final intensities were corrected for the dilution due to the addition of CheY. For measurement of emission spectra and equilibrium titrations, a 1 × 1-cm cuvette was used (sample volume, 1.5 ml) with magnetic stirring. The cuvette chamber was left open during experiments to eliminate the sensitivity of the fluorescence signal to opening and closing of the cuvette chamber. *B-CheZ·CheYBeF3 dissociation time courses were monitored at 20 °C using a rapid mixing accessory (Applied Photophysics RX-2000) in conjunction with the PerkinElmer LS-50B spectrofluorimeter. In these experiments, one syringe of the rapid mixer contained *B-CheZ (1.0 μm) and CheY (2.0 μm) in buffer containing 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.0, 10 mm MgCl2, 0.10 mm BeCl2, and 10 mm NaF. The other syringe contained unlabeled CheZ (20 μm; either wild type or CheZ-I21T to match the CheZ used in the complex) in the same buffer. Mixture of the two solutions resulted in recovery of the fluorescence of uncomplexed *B-CheZ at a rate that reflects dissociation of CheYBeF3 from the badan-CheZ·CheYBeF3 complex. For each CheZ 6–8 repetitive time courses were recorded with data points taken every 100 ms. Data from each time course were fit to an equation describing a single exponential decay using nonlinear regression (Prism), and the first order rate constants of the repetitive shots were averaged. The resultant rate constants from two to three independent experiments for both wild type CheZ and CheZ-I21T were then averaged. To measure the kinetics of association of *B-CheZ or *B-CheZ-I21T with phosphorylated CheY-N59R, a SPEX Fluorolog-3 spectrofluorimeter equipped with a Jobin Yvon Horiba F-3009 Microflow stop flow device (dead time, ∼5 ms) was used. For these experiments, one syringe contained 0.4 μm badan-CheZ (*B-CheZ or *B-CheZ-I21T) in reaction buffer (50 mm Hepes, pH 7.0, 10 mm MgCl2), and the other syringe contained CheY N59R (2–60 μm) in reaction buffer supplemented with 20 mm phosphoramidate (synthesized according to Sheridan et al. (29Sheridan R.C. McCullough J.F. Wakefield Z.T. Inorg. Synth. 1972; 13: 23-26Google Scholar)). The experiments were carried out at room temperature (22–23 °C) or at a constant temperature of 23 °C using a circulating thermostatted water bath. For each CheY concentration, 4–13 time courses were recorded by repetitive shots, and data were recorded at 10-ms intervals for *B-CheZ reactions and 2-ms intervals for *B-CheZ-I21T reactions. The data (the first 300 ms for *B-CheZ and 60 ms for *B-CheZ-I21T) were fit to a single exponential decay using nonlinear regression (Prism). CheY-N59Rp binds efficiently to CheZ but is resistant to its phosphatase activity (23Silversmith R.E. Smith J.G. Guanga G.P. Les J.T. Bourret R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 18478-18484Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) and was used in these experiments to avoid the toxicity of beryllium. Computer Simulations—Rate equations for the reaction scheme presented under “Discussion” were derived and encoded in a C++ program employing Euler's method as the numerical integrator. Each simulation was run for 60 s of simulated time to reach steady state. Inputs to the program are the amounts of unphosphorylated CheY and CheZ and a set of rate constants for the reactions; outputs of the program are the concentration of CheYp and the rate of phosphate release at time 60 s, given an external source of phosphoryl groups in excess. The simulations were performed on a PowerPC G4 running Mac OS X Version 10.4.9. Steady State Kinetic Analysis of Dephosphorylation of CheYp Mediated by Wild Type CheZ Indicates Positive Cooperativity—The rate of Pi release in reactions containing various amounts of CheY (0 to 5 μm), 4 mm monophosphoimidazole, and either 0, 50 nm, or 3 μm CheZ were measured and plotted as a function of total CheY concentration (Fig. 2A). Rates of Pi release in the absence of CheZ reflect CheY autodephosphorylation, and rates in the presence of 3 μm (excess) CheZ represent the fastest rate of Pi release possible at each CheY concentration, i.e. the rate of CheY autophosphorylation. Analysis of the raw data as described under “Experimental Procedures” first involved calculation of the concentration of CheYp present under each steady state reaction condition (Fig. 2B), which finally led to the relationship between CheZ activity and CheYp concentration (Fig. 2C). This relationship displayed marked sigmoidicity, suggesting the presence of positive cooperativity. Fitting the data from three independent experiments to the Hill equation gave a Hill coefficient of 2.1 ± 0.3 (see Fig. 2C for sample curve fit), a K0.5 value of 0.8 ± 0.1 μm, and a kcat of 4.9 ± 0.1 s–1. Several control experiments were performed to ensure that the rates measured at low CheYp were not an artifact of the experimental process due to the small magnitudes of Pi release rates in the presence and absence of CheZ. First, time courses of Pi release were carried out for reactions containing 0.2, 0.4, and 0.6 μm CheY (±50 nm CheZ) for 80 min rather than the standard 30 min. The rates were linear over the entire time course, eliminating the possibility that a lag phase contributed to low activity. Furthermore, the longer time points (with larger differences in absorbance in the presence and absence of CheZ) gave the same specific activity as those measured in the single time point experiment, thus excluding low absorbances as a source of error. Second, the concentration of bovine serum albumin in the reaction buffer was varied between 0, 0.10, 0.50, and 1 mg/ml with no change in results, implying that the low concentrations of CheY present in these reactions were not adsorbed on to the surface of the microtiter plate. Comparative Kinetic Analysis for Gain of Function Mutant CheZ-I21T Indicates Loss of Cooperativity—Cells containing CheZ-I21T are incapable of chemotaxis due to constitutively counterclockwise flagellar rotation, consistent with an increase in CheZ phosphatase activity (30Sanna M.G. Simon M.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7357-7361Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Ile-21 is located on the N-helix, close to the bottom of the four helix bundle and more than 40 Å from the active site (Fig. 1). Preliminary experiments for kinetic analysis of CheZ-I21T showed that at 50 nm CheZ-I21T (the same concentration of CheZ used in the wild type CheZ experiment), the rate of Pi release at low CheY concentrations (0.1–0.4 μm) was the same as that for 3 μm (excess) CheZ, whereas Vmax was approximately unchanged (data not shown). Therefore, at low CheY concentrations, CheZ-I21T was dephosphorylating CheY as fast as it was being phosphorylated, precluding determination of accurate rates. Therefore, for analysis of CheZ-I21T, we used the CheY-A113P mutant whose autophosphorylation is 6-fold faster but has similar CheZ sensitivity as wild type CheY (27Smith J.G. Latiolais J.A. Guanga G.P. Pennington J.D. Silversmith R.E. Bourret R.B. Mol. Microbiol. 2004; 51: 887-901Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). These features should give higher rates of Pi release in the presence of excess CheZ and, therefore, a larger window in which to assess activity due to limiting amounts of CheZ. As predicted, the data demonstrated a slope for Pi release rate from CheY-A113P in the presence of excess CheZ that was about 3.5 times the slope for wild type CheY (data not shown). Final analysis of the data using catalytic (50 nm) wild type CheZ revealed sigmoidicity with respect to CheY-A113Pp (Fig. 2D) as observed with wild type CheYp, with only modest changes in other kinetic parameters. Kinetic parameters derived from three independent measurements gave a Hill coefficient of 2.2 ± 0.2, K0.5 of 0.3 ± 0.1 μm, and kcat of 3.5 ± 0.3 s–1. In contrast, CheZ-I21T displayed apparently hyperbolic kinetics with enhanced activity relative to wild type CheZ at low CheY concentrations but had a similar kcat as wild type CheZ (Fig. 2D). The kinetic parameters for CheZ-I21T averaged from three independent experiments gave a Hill coefficient of 1.2 ± 0.3, K0.5 of 0.08 ± 0.03 μm, and a kcat of 2.7 ± 0.3 s–1. Therefore, a predominant effect of the CheZ-I21T substitution is to eliminate the positive cooperativity observed with wild type CheZ while enhancin"
https://openalex.org/W1998079931,"Mutations in the neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2) gene cause formation of schwannomas and other tumors in the nervous system. The NF2 protein, Schwannomin/Merlin, is a cytoskeleton-associated tumor suppressor regulated by phosphorylation at serine 518 (S518). Unphosphorylated Schwannomin restricts cell proliferation in part by inhibiting Rac- and p21-activated kinase (Pak). In a negative-feedback loop, Pak phosphorylates Schwannomin inactivating its ability to inhibit Pak. Little is known about receptor mechanisms that promote Pak activity and Schwannomin phosphorylation. Here we demonstrate in primary Schwann cells (SCs) that Schwannomin is rapidly phosphorylated on S518 by Pak following laminin-1 binding to beta1 integrin, and by protein kinase A following neuregulin-1beta (NRG1beta) binding to ErbB2/ErbB3 receptors. These receptors, together with phosphorylated Schwannomin, P-Pak, Cdc42 and paxillin are enriched at the distal tips of SC processes, and can be isolated as a complex using beta1 integrin antibody. Dual stimulation with laminin-1 and NRG1beta does not synergistically increase Schwannomin phosphorylation because ErbB2 kinase partially antagonizes integrin-dependent activation of Pak. These results identify two parallel, but interactive pathways that inactivate the tumor suppressor activity of Schwannomin to allow proliferation of subconfluent SCs. Moreover, they identify ErbB2, ErbB3 and beta1 integrins as potential therapeutic targets for NF2."
https://openalex.org/W2008583061,"Background Mucins are the major components of mucus and their genes share a common, centrally-located region of sequence that encodes tandem repeats. Mucins are well known genes with respect to their specific expression levels; however, their genomic levels are unclear because of complex genomic properties. In this study, we identified eight novel minisatellites from the entire MUC2 region and investigated how allelic variation in these minisatellites may affect susceptibility to gastrointestinal cancer. Methodology/Principle Findings We analyzed genomic DNA from the blood of normal healthy individuals and multi-generational family groups. Six of the eight minisatellites exhibited polymorphism and were transmitted meiotically in seven families, following Mendelian inheritance. Furthermore, a case-control study was performed that compared genomic DNA from 457 cancer-free controls with DNA from individuals with gastric (455), colon (192) and rectal (271) cancers. A statistically significant association was identified between rare exonic MUC2-MS6 alleles and the occurrence of gastric cancer: odds ratio (OR), 2.56; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.31–5.04; and p = 0.0047. We focused on an association between rare alleles and gastric cancer. Rare alleles were divided into short (40, 43 and 44) and long (47, 50 and 54), according to their TR (tandem repeats) lengths. Interestingly, short rare alleles were associated with gastric cancer (OR = 5.6, 95% CI: 1.93–16.42; p = 0.00036). Moreover, hypervariable MUC2 minisatellites were analyzed in matched blood and cancer tissue from 28 patients with gastric cancer and in 4 cases of MUC2-MS2, minisatellites were found to have undergone rearrangement. Conclusions/Significance Our observations suggest that the short rare MUC2-MS6 alleles could function as identifiers for risk of gastric cancer. Additionally, we suggest that minisatellite instability might be associated with MUC2 function in cancer cells."
https://openalex.org/W2048846543,"Abstract Morphological hallmarks of apoptosis result from activation of the caspase family of cysteine proteases, which are opposed by a pro-survival family of inhibitors of apoptosis proteins (IAPs). In Drosophila, disruption of IAP function by Reaper, HID, and Grim (RHG) proteins is sufficient to induce cell death. RHG proteins have been reported to localize to mitochondria, which, in the case of both Reaper and Grim proteins, is mediated by an amphipathic helical domain known as the GH3. Through direct binding, Reaper can bring the Drosophila IAP (DIAP1) to mitochondria, concomitantly promoting IAP auto-ubiquitination and destruction. Whether this localization is sufficient to induce DIAP1 auto-ubiquitination has not been reported. In this study we characterize the interaction between Reaper and the mitochondria using both Xenopus and Drosophila systems. We find that Reaper concentrates on the outer surface of mitochondria in a nonperipheral manner largely mediated by GH3-lipid interactions. Importantly, we show that mitochondrial targeting of DIAP1 alone is not sufficient for degradation and requires Reaper binding. Conversely, Reaper able to bind IAPs, but lacking a mitochondrial targeting GH3 domain (ΔGH3 Reaper), can induce DIAP1 turnover only if DIAP1 is otherwise targeted to membranes. Surprisingly, targeting DIAP1 to the endoplasmic reticulum instead of mitochondria is partially effective in allowing ΔGH3 Reaper to promote DIAP1 degradation, suggesting that co-localization of DIAP and Reaper at a membrane surface is critical for the induction of DIAP degradation. Collectively, these data provide a specific function for the GH3 domain in conferring protein-lipid interactions, demonstrate that both Reaper binding and mitochondrial localization are required for accelerated IAP degradation, and suggest that membrane localization per se contributes to DIAP1 auto-ubiquitination and degradation."

Initiation involves the binding of RNA polymerase (RNAP)2 to a gene’s promoter and the beginning of RNA synthesis. Elongation involves lengthening the nascent transcript by the addition of nucleotides to the 3 -end of the RNA located in the active site of RNAP. The last stage of transcription, termination, involves stopping RNA synthesis, release of the transcript, and dissociation of the RNAP from the DNA template."

These proteins adopt a similar active conformation; the single chain LAGLIDADG proteins display two distinct domains with 2-fold pseudo-symmetry, similar to the perfect 2-fold symmetry of the homodimeric proteins. The two LAGLIDADG motifs form structurally conserved α-helices tightly packed at the center of the interdomain or intermonomer interface. On either side of the LAGLIDADG α-helices, a four-stranded β-sheet provides a DNA-binding interface that drives the base-specific interaction of the protein with each one of the half-sites of the target DNA sequence (11Jurica M.S.

Several hundred HEs have been identified to date, but the probability of finding an HE cleavage site in a chosen gene is still very low. Thus, generating artificial meganucleases with tailored specificity by rational design or mutagenesis and screening and/or selection is a field of intense research (20Ashworth J. Havranek J.J.

Recently, we used a semi-rational mutagenesis approach coupled with high throughput screening to derive hundreds of novel endonucleases from I-CreI, an HE with locally altered specificity from the LAGLIDADG family (22Arnould S.

Biol. 2006; 355: 443-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). We also used a combinatorial and rational approach for engineering the overall specificity of these proteins and for designing an endonuclease that cleaves sequences from the human RAG1 and XPC genes (26Smith J. Grizot S. Arnould S. Duclert A. Epinat J.C. Chames P. Prieto J. Redondo P. Blanco F.J. Bravo J. Montoya G. Paques F. Duchateau P.

However, these meganucleases are heterodimers, consisting of two engineered monomers that need to be co-expressed in the targeted cell, a characteristic stemming from the homodimeric nature of I-CreI. As a consequence, we actually produce two undesired homodimers in addition to the heterodimer. We know that natural and engineered meganucleases tolerate a certain degree of degeneracy (5Chevalier B.S. Stoddard B.L.

Golic M. Golic K.G. Carroll D. Genetics. 2002; 161: 1169-1175Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). One possible way of bypassing this issue is to use single chain scaffolds. Previous studies have described the development of single chain I-CreI versions (29Epinat J.C. Arnould S. Chames P. Rochaix P. Desfontaines D. Puzin C. Patin A. Zanghellini A. Paques F. Lacroix E.

However, both proteins have shown intrinsic limits: the single chain I-CreI molecule is imperfectly folded (29Epinat J.C. Arnould S. Chames P. Rochaix P. Desfontaines D. Puzin C. Patin A.

Arnould, P. Duchateau, and F. Pâques, unpublished results.6S. Grizot, S. Arnould, P. Duchateau, and F.

Another limit of the I-CreI scaffold is the number of sequences that can be targeted by engineered derivatives. One of the most elusive factors in DNA binding and cleavage by I-CreI is the role of the four central nucleotides of the DNA target molecule. No direct contact has been reported between the protein residues and the DNA four central bases of the DNA; however, several nucleotide substitutions in this region result in a total loss of cleavage by I-CreI and its engineered derivatives (27Arnould S. Perez C. Cabaniols J.P. Smith J. Gouble A. Grizot S. Epinat J.C. Duclert A. Duchateau P. Paques F. J. Mol. Biol. 2007; 371: 49-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 31Argast G.M.

However, given the absence of such information, it may be very difficult to change the recognition pattern in the central part of the I-CreI target. Again, using other scaffolds may address this issue, and they would ideally be monomeric (see above). I-DmoI is a well characterized HE, encoded by an archaeal intron from the hyperthermophile archaeon Desulfurococcus mobilis (8Dalgaard J.Z. Garrett R.A. Belfort M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

I-DmoI is an attractive scaffold for engineering novel DNA sequence specificities, as its monomeric nature allows for the generation of single chain mutants with altered specificities along the whole DNA recognition sequence. Screening for novel specificities in living cells requires that the activity is detectable at mesophilic temperatures. However, I-DmoI, as expected for an endonuclease from a hyperthermophilic organism, is essentially active at high temperatures, displaying no activity or residual activity at 37 °C (8Dalgaard J.Z. Garrett R.A. Belfort M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 5414-5417Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). In this study, we generated I-DmoI variants with enhanced cleavage activity at physiological temperatures in yeast. Two of the proteins were characterized in vitro and were less stable and more active at lower temperatures than the wild type. These novel I-DmoI variants could be used as initial scaffolds for engineering proteins that cleave new DNA targets, using a similar strategy to that described previously for I-CreI (22Arnould S.

Paques F. J. Mol. Biol. 2007; 371: 49-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Construction of Mutant Libraries and Target Vectors–A library of I-DmoI variant open reading frames was generated as follows: the first 300 bp of the wild-type I-DmoI-encoding gene were amplified by mutagenic PCR (36Cadwell R.C. Joyce G.F. PCR Methods Applications. 1992; 2: 28-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (819) Google Scholar, 37Cadwell R.C. Joyce G.F. PCR Methods Applications. 1994; 3: S136-S140Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar), whereas the second half of the gene was amplified with a high fidelity enzyme. For mutagenic PCR, we used classic PCR conditions known to enhance the natural mutation rate of a Taq polymerase. MgCl2 concentration was increased to stabilize DNA mismatches, and MnCl2 was added to decrease the fidelity of the enzyme, and the concentrations of dCTP, dTTP, and polymerase were increased to favor misincorporation, as described in previous reports (36Cadwell R.C. Joyce G.F. PCR Methods Applications. 1992; 2: 28-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (819) Google Scholar, 37Cadwell R.C. Joyce G.F. PCR Methods Applications. 1994; 3: S136-S140Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). Under these conditions, the mutation rate was measured to be 6.6 × 10-3 per nucleotide resulting in 96% of mutated molecules, each one with one to six mutations (36Cadwell R.C. Joyce G.F. PCR Methods Applications. 1992; 2: 28-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (819) Google Scholar). Both PCR amplifications overlapped. This allowed a second conservative amplification, reconstituting a full-length I-DmoI gene; the first part contained the mutated domain (from the ATG start codon to the beginning of the second LAGLIDADG domain), and the second part contained the wild-type encoding sequence (from the second LAGLIDADG domain to the stop codon). The resulting PCR products were introduced into the 2-μm-based replicative vector pCLS542 marked with the LEU2 gene and transformed into the Saccharomyces cerevisiae selection strain (see below) as described previously (22Arnould S. Chames P. Perez C. Lacroix E. Duclert A. Epinat J.C. Stricher F. Petit A.S. Patin A. Guillier S. Rolland S. Prieto J. Blanco F.J. Bravo J. Montoya G. Serrano L. Duchateau P. Paques F. J. Mol. Biol. 2006; 355: 443-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Yeast reporter vectors were constructed as described previously (22Arnould S. Chames P. Perez C. Lacroix E. Duclert A. Epinat J.C. Stricher F. Petit A.S. Patin A. Guillier S. Rolland S. Prieto J. Blanco F.J. Bravo J. Montoya G. Serrano L. Duchateau P. Paques F. J. Mol.

Belfort M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28885-28892Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was cloned using the Gateway protocol (Invitrogen) into the yeast reporter vector pFL39-ADH-LACURAZ, which contains a control I-SceI target site, as described previously (21Gimble F.S. Moure C.M. Posey K.L. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 334: 993-1008Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 22Arnould S. Chames P. Perez C. Lacroix E. Duclert A. Epinat J.C. Stricher F. Petit A.S. Patin A.

The yeast reporter vector was transformed into the S. cerevisiae strain FYBL2-7B (MATa, ura3Δ851, trp1Δ63, leu2Δ1, lys2Δ202). Selection in Yeast–A yeast strain, specific for selecting endonucleases that cleave the I-DmoI related targets, was constructed with strain FYC2-6A (MATα, trp1Δ63, leu2Δ1, his3Δ200), as described previously (39Chames P. Epinat J.C. Guillier S. Patin A. Lacroix E. Paques F. Nucleic Acids Res. 2005; 33: e178Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The LYS2 endogenous gene was disrupted using the “pop-in” transformation method (40Hicks J.B. Hinnen A. Fink G.R. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1979; 43: 1305-1313Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), resulting in two truncated but overlapping lys2 genes, separated by a cassette containing a kanamycin resistance gene and the I-DmoI target site. The ADE2 gene was similarly disrupted, resulting in two truncated ade2 copies separated by an I-DmoI site and a TRP1 gene (39Chames P. Epinat J.C. Guillier S. Patin A. Lacroix E. Paques F. Nucleic Acids Res. 2005; 33: e178Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Cleavage of the I-DmoI sites resulted in functional LYS2 and ADE2 genes by tandem repeat recombination (Fig. 1a). The final selection yeast strain was G418-resistant, Trp+, Ade-, and Lys-. For selection, yeast cells from the selection strain were transformed with the I-DmoI mutant library, marked with the LEU2 gene. Cells were plated onto a selective medium lacking leucine with glucose (2%) as a carbon source. After 3 days of growth at 37 °C, colonies were suspended in water, and aliquots of the suspension were plated onto selective media lacking leucine, adenine, and lysine, and containing galactose (2%). Leu+, Ade+, and Lys+ isolates were picked and rearrayed for screening. Screening in Yeast–After selection, Leu+, Ade+, and Lys+ isolates were screened for their ability to induce tandem repeat recombination in a LacZ reporter plasmid carrying an I-DmoI cleavage site. For this, isolates were mated with the FYBL2-7B (MATa, ura3Δ851, trp1Δ63, leu2Δ1, lys2Δ202) yeast strain carrying the reporter system described in Fig. 1b, and diploids were grown at 37 °C on selective media containing galactose (2%). Meganuclease-induced recombination of the LacZ reporter system restores a functional β-galactosidase gene, which can be detected by X-gal staining. Mating, cleavage induction, and X-gal staining were performed as described previously (22Arnould S. Chames P. Perez C. Lacroix E. Duclert A. Epinat J.C. Stricher F. Petit A.S. Patin A. Guillier S. Rolland S. Prieto J. Blanco F.J. Bravo J. Montoya G. Serrano L. Duchateau P. Paques F. J. Mol. Biol. 2006; 355: 443-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Sequencing of Positive Clones–DNA was extracted from positive clones using Lyticase (from Sigma L2524); 1.5 ml of saturated cultures (microtubes or deep well plates) were centrifuged, and the pellet was resuspended with 50 μl of 33.5 mm KH2PO4, pH 7.5. Lyticase (20 μl of 2.5 units/μl) was added, and the samples were incubated at 37 °C for 1 h. Spheroplasts were lysed by hypo-osmotic shock by adding 10 μl of SDS (20% stock). The debris was removed by centrifugation. An aliquot of the supernatant was used to transform Escherichia coli and amplify plasmid DNA. Two E. coli isolates were selected for each yeast-positive isolate. Plasmid DNA was then extracted and sequenced. Protein Expression and Purification–For expression in E. coli, the I-DmoI gene was obtained as described (29Epinat J.C. Arnould S. Chames P. Rochaix P. Desfontaines D. Puzin C. Patin A. Zanghellini A. Paques F. Lacroix E. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 2952-2962Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar), and the I-DmoI mutants, D1 and D2, were generated using the QuikChange XL site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). This construct is 200 residues long and differs from the native I-DmoI protein by an extra Ala residue at the N terminus and an AAALEHHHHHH sequence at the C-terminal end for affinity purification. This recombinant enzyme is active (29Epinat J.C. Arnould S. Chames P. Rochaix P. Desfontaines D. Puzin C. Patin A. Zanghellini A. Paques F. Lacroix E. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 2952-2962Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar) and corresponds to the sequence coded by the linear form of the intron after excision; this linear form is 6 residues shorter at the C-terminal end than that coded by the circularized intron (8Dalgaard J.Z. Garrett R.A. Belfort M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 5414-5417Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Both forms have very similar biochemical properties (38Dalgaard J.Z. Garrett R.A. Belfort M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28885-28892Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the crystal structure of the short enzyme, the last 9 residues are not observed (41Dalgaard J.Z. Silva G.H. Belfort M. Van Roey P. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 1435-1436Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), indicating that the C-terminal end is flexible. The genes were inserted into pET-24d (+) vectors (Novagen) and overexpressed in E. coli Rosetta(DE3)pLysS at 25 °C. The protein purification protocol was similar to that described for I-CreI homing endonucleases (27Arnould S. Perez C. Cabaniols J.P. Smith J. Gouble A. Grizot S. Epinat J.C. Duclert A. Duchateau P.

Pure proteins in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, 137 mm NaCl, 10 mm sodium phosphate, 2.7 mm KCl, 2 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.4) were flash-frozen with liquid nitrogen and stored at -80 °C until use. Overloaded Coomassie-stained SDS-polyacrylamide gels showed that the proteins were almost 100% pure. The identity of the proteins was confirmed by mass spectrometry, which indicated that the initial methionine was not present in the purified proteins. Protein concentrations were measured by ultraviolet absorbance using an extinction coefficient of 25,900 m-1 cm-1, calculated from the amino acid sequence using the ProtParam web server. Circular Dichroism (CD) Analysis–Far-UV CD spectra (250-190 nm) were recorded at 20 °C on a Jasco-810 dichrograph equipped with a Peltier thermoelectric temperature controller, previously calibrated with d-10-camphorsulfonic acid. The spectra were acquired in the continuous mode with 2 nm bandwidth, 4-s response, and a scan speed of 100 nm/min. We used 0.1-cm path length quartz cuvettes (Hellma) and protein samples with a concentration of 150 μm in PBS for CD analysis. Ten scans were accumulated to obtain the final spectra. Thermal denaturation curves were obtained at a protein concentration of 10 μm in a 2-mm cuvette. The ellipticity at 222 nm from 5 to 95 °C was recorded at 1 °C/min intervals. NMR Spectroscopy–1H NMR spectra were recorded at 25 °C in a Bruker AVANCE 600 spectrometer equipped with a cryoprobe. The concentrations of protein samples were 500 μm in PBS plus 5% 2H2O. 2,2-Dimethyl-2-silapentane-5-sulfonate sodium salt was used as internal proton chemical shift reference. Analytical Ultracentrifugation–Sedimentation velocity and equilibrium experiments were performed on 200 μm protein samples in PBS at 20 °C, as described previously for I-CreI proteins (42Prieto J. Redondo P. Padro D. Arnould S. Epinat J.C. Paques F. Blanco F.J. Montoya G. Nucleic Acids Res. 2007; 35: 3262-3271Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Chemical Denaturation–I-DmoI, D1, and D2 proteins were unfolded using guanidine hydrochloride (GdnHCl, Sigma). A stock solution of 8 m GdnHCl was gravimetrically prepared at 20 °C i"

The Ras association (RA) domain of PLCϵ is known to be important for its ability to bind with Ras-family GTPase upon growth factor stimulation. In the present study, we identified Siah1 and Siah2 as novel binding partners of the PLCϵ RA domain. Both Siah1 and Siah2 interacted with the RA2 domain of PLCϵ, and the mutation of Lys-2186 of the PLCϵ RA2 domain abolished this association. Moreover, Siah induced the ubiquitination and degradation of PLCϵ upon epidermal growth factor (EGF) stimulation, and Siah proteins were phosphorylated on multiple tyrosine residues via an Src-dependent pathway upon EGF treatment. The Src inhibitor abolished the EGF-dependent ubiquitination of PLCϵ, and the Siah1 phosphorylation-deficient mutant could not increase the EGF-dependent ubiquitination and degradation of PLCϵ. The EGF-dependent degradation of PLCϵ was blocked in mouse embryonic fibroblast (MEF) cells derived from Siah1a/Siah2 double knockout mice, and the extrinsic expression of wild-type Siah1 restored the degradation of PLCϵ, whereas the phosphorylation-deficient mutant did not. Siah1 expression abolished PLCϵ-dependent potentiation of EGF-dependent cell growth. In addition, the expression of wild-type Siah1 in Siah1a/Siah2-double knockout MEF cells inhibited EGF-dependent cell growth, and this inhibition was abolished by PLCϵ knockdown. Our results suggest that the Siah-dependent degradation of PLCϵ plays a role in the regulation of growth factor-dependent cell growth.

So far, 14 PLC isoforms have been cloned in mammals. Based on their functional and structural characteristics, they have been grouped into five classes: PLCβ (β1-β4), PLCδ (δ1-δ4), PLCγ (γ1 and γ2), PLCϵ, PLCζ, and PLCη (η1 and η2) (1Rhee S.G. Annu.

PLCϵ plays a role in the interplay between PLC and small GTPases. Various G-proteins directly activate PLCϵ. For example, RhoA was found to stimulate PLCϵ activity by interacting with a 65-amino acid insert within the catalytic core of PLCϵ (4Seifert J.P. Wing M.R. Snyder J.T. Gershburg S. Sondek J. Harden T.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 47992-47997Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Lysophosphatidic acid and thrombin stimulates PLCϵ by activating Gα12 and/or Gα13 and downstream RhoA (5Hains M.D. Wing M.R. Maddileti S. Siderovski D.P. Harden T.K. Mol. Pharmacol. 2006; 69: 2068-2075Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Moreover, Ras-family GTPases activate PLCϵ by binding with the RA domain of PLCϵ. Adrenaline and prostaglandin E1 have been reported to activate PLCϵ by triggering adenylyl cyclase-coupled receptors, and Rap2B, which is regulated by Epac (a guanine-nucleotide-exchange factor regulated by cAMP), has been found to associate with the RA domain of PLCϵ during PLCϵ activation (6Schmidt M.

In addition, EGF treatment was found to induce an association between the PLCϵ RA domain and activated Ras, and this resulted in the recruitment of PLCϵ into the plasma membrane for activation (8Song C.

Several physiological studies have indicated that PLCϵ is involved in development and cell growth. PLCϵ knockout mice had cardiac dysfunction resulting from defective heart development or were susceptible to hypertrophy in response to chronic cardiac stress (9Tadano M. Edamatsu H. Minamisawa S.

Recently, mutations of PLCϵ in individuals with severe nephrotic syndrome were identified, and PLCϵ knockdown in zebra fish led to a loss of the filtration barrier maintained by glomerular podocytes, which in combination demonstrate the importance of PLCϵ in kidney development and function (11Hinkes B. Wiggins R.C. Gbadegesin R. Vlangos C.N. Seelow D. Nurnberg G. Garg P. Verma R. Chaib H. Hoskins B.E. Ashraf S. Becker C. Hennies H.C. Goyal M. Wharram B.L. Schachter A.D. Mudumana S. Drummond I.

Moreover, ablation of PLCϵ activity in mice led to reduced carcinogen-induced skin tumor formation, providing evidence that PLCϵ plays a positive role in tumor cell growth (12Bai Y. Edamatsu H. Maeda S. Saito H. Suzuki N. Satoh T. Kataoka T. Cancer Res. 2004; 64: 8808-8810Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the overexpression of PLCϵ in BaF3 cells induced platelet-derived growth factor-dependent cell growth (13Song C. Satoh T. Edamatsu H. Wu D. Tadano M. Gao X. Kataoka T. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 8105-8113Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Siah proteins are homologues of Drosophila SINA, which is a ring-finger protein involved in R7 cell development in the eye (14Carthew R.W. Rubin G.M. Cell. 1990; 63: 561-577Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). Three murine (Siah1a, Siah1b, and Siah2) and two human (SIAH1 and SIAH2) homologues have been identified. The mammalian Siah proteins are highly homologous; Siah1a and Siah1b are 98% identical, whereas Siah1 proteins and Siah2 protein diverge significantly only at their N termini (15Della N.G.

Siah proteins are RING finger proteins with E3 ligase activity and have been implicated in the ubiquitination and proteasome-dependent degradation of various substrate molecules.

In particular, the involvement of Siah proteins in cell growth regulation has been suggested in many reports. Siah1 expression is induced by tumor suppressor p53 in mammals and the overexpression of Siah1 inhibits cell proliferation and promotes apoptosis (23Amson R.B. Nemani M. Roperch J.P. Israeli D.

Moreover, Siah-induced β-catenin degradation is important for the negative regulation of cell proliferation (26Liu J. Stevens J. Rote C. Yost H. Hu Y. Neufeld K. White R. Matsunami N. Mol.

Furthermore, mutations of Siah proteins in several cancers have been reported (29Kim C.J. Cho Y.G. Park C.H. Jeong S.W. Nam S.W. Kim S.Y. Lee S.H. Yoo N.J. Lee J.Y. Park W.S. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 8591-8596Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). These reports imply that Siah has tumor suppressor functions in some experimental settings. To identify novel PLCϵ regulatory proteins, we performed yeast two-hybrid analysis using the RA domain of PLCϵ, and Siah1 and Siah2 were identified as PLCϵ-binding proteins. Here, we demonstrate that Siah proteins induce the proteasomal degradation of PLCϵ after EGF stimulation. Src-dependent phosphorylation was found to be required for the EGF-dependent degradation of PLCϵ. Moreover, the Siah-dependent degradation of PLCϵ was found to act as an important negative regulator of PLCϵ-dependent cell growth. Antibodies—Rabbit polyclonal antibody of PLCϵ was obtained from Dr. Tohru Kataoka (Kobe University, Japan). Mouse monoclonal antibody of Siah1 was described previously (30Frew I.J. Dickins R.A. Cuddihy A.R. Del Rosario M. Reinhard C. O'Connell M.J. Bowtell D.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 8155-8164Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Other antibodies used were: goat polyclonal anti-Siah2 antibody and goat polyclonal anti-AH receptor antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), mouse monoclonal anti-FLAG antibody (Sigma), mouse monoclonal anti-Myc antibody (Invitrogen), mouse monoclonal anti-HA antibody (Sigma, St. Louis, MO), Rhodamine-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG and fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG, were purchased from Sigma. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG and goat anti-mouse IgA, IgM, and IgG were from Kirkegaard & Perry Laboratories (Gaithersburg, MD). Cell Culture—COS-7 cells were grown in DMEM containing 10% bovine calf serum, antibiotics, and glutamine. Wild-type and Siah-deficient MEF cells were grown in DMEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 0.02 mm β-mercaptoethanol, antibiotics, and glutamine as previously described (30Frew I.J. Dickins R.A. Cuddihy A.R. Del Rosario M. Reinhard C. O'Connell M.J. Bowtell D.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 8155-8164Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Cells were grown to ∼90% confluence for immunoprecipitation and Western blot experiments. Yeast Two-hybrid Screening—PLCϵ RA domains (amino acids 1990-2218) were cloned into the pLexA (BD Clontech) in-frame with the LexA DNA-binding domain (referred to as pLexA-PLCϵ). The yeast strain, EGY48, carrying a reporter gene was cotransformed with the bait plasmid, pLexA-PLCϵ, and a human HeLa cDNA library fused to the VP16 activation domain. Transformation was carried out using the lithium acetate method (31Gietz D. St Jean A. Woods K.A. Schiestl R.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 1425Crossref PubMed Scopus (2883) Google Scholar). Leucine-positive colonies were identified by a filter-lifting assay for β-galactosidase activity. Library-derived DNA was prepared from candidate clones and analyzed by DNA sequencing. Immunoprecipitation—Cells were lysed with TGH buffer (1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, 50 mm NaCl, 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.3, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 10 mm sodium fluoride, 1 mm phenylmethysulfonyl fluoride, 10 mg/ml leupeptin, 10 mg/ml aprotinin). Lysates were then centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. Super-natants were incubated with anti-HA, anti-FLAG for 3 h and then washed with TGH buffer three times. Immunoprecipitates were subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. PLCϵ Phosphorylation Analysis—COS-7 cell-transfected Siah proteins were serum-starved for 20 h and then incubated with 1 mCi of [32P]orthophosphate in 2 ml of phosphate-free DMEM for 4 h at 37 °C. Cells were treated with 100 ng/ml EGF for the indicated times. Cell lysates were prepared, and Siah proteins were immunoprecipitated. The immunocomplexes were subjected to SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. The amounts of immunoprecipitated Siah proteins were measured by immunoblotting and used for the quantitation of relative Siah phosphorylation. Cell Growth Assay—MEF cells were seeded in triplicate into 6-well plates at a density of 2 × 105 cells per well and were transfected with PLCϵ siRNA or control scrambled siRNA. After 24 h, cells were incubated with serum-free DMEM for 24 h to reach quiescence. The cells were incubated in serum-free medium supplemented with 100 ng/ml EGF for 18 h prior to addition of 3H-labeled thymidine for additional 6 h. Thymidine incorporation was measured as previously reported (32Coward P. Wada H.G. Falk M.S. Chan S.D.H. Meng F. Akil H. Conklin B.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 352-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). Plasmid Construction and Mutagenesis—FLAG-tagged mouse PLCϵ DNA is a generous gift from Dr. Tohru Kataoka (Kobe University, Japan). For the construction of Siah binding-deficient mutant, evolutionally conserved VLK (2173-2175) sequence was changed into AAA (called PLCϵ 3A) or Lys-2186 residue was changed into alanine (called PLCϵ K2186A) by site-directed mutagenesis. PLCϵ K2151E/K2153E is a Ras binding-deficient mutant. Siah1 wild-type and Y100F/Y126F mutant DNA was kindly provided by Dr. Zhiheng Xu (Columbia University) and introduced into pcDNA-HA vector by PCR amplification. To construct phosphorylation-deficient mutant of Siah1, Tyr-47, Tyr-199, and Tyr-223 were changed into phenylalanines (called Siah1 TM). For expression of Siah1 in knockout MEF cells, wild-type Siah1 or Siah1 TM were PCR-amplified and cloned into a lentivirus-derived C-FUW vector (33Lois C. Hong E.J. Pease S. Brown E.J. Baltimore D. Science. 2002; 295: 868-872Crossref PubMed Scopus (1596) Google Scholar). Production of Lentivirus-harboring Siah1—Lentivirus infection was performed as previously described (34Stewart S.A. Dykxhoorn D.M. Palliser D. Mizuno H. Yu E.Y. An D.S. Sabatini D.M. Chen I.S. Hahn W.C. Sharp P.A. Weinberg R.A. Novina C.D. RNA (N. Y.). 2003; 9: 493-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (974) Google Scholar). PLCϵ Knockdown in MEF Cells—Synthetic siRNA against PLCϵ and control scrambled siRNA was introduced into MEF cells using LipofectAMINE (Invitrogen). PLCϵ siRNA (GCCAAATATTCCTACAGCA) and control scrambled siRNA (ACTGTCACAAGTACCTACA) have been previously described (35Kelley G.G. Kaproth-Joslin K.A. Reks S.E. Smrcka A.V. Wojcikiewicz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 2639-2648Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Interaction between PLCϵ and Siah Proteins—We sought to identify binding partners of the PLCϵ RA domain and performed a yeast two-hybrid analysis using bait containing the serial RA1 and RA2 domain of PLCϵ. Our yeast two-hybrid analysis revealed that the RA domain of PLCϵ interacts with various proteins other than small GTPases. Siah1 and Siah2 were identified as novel PLCϵ RA domain-binding proteins. The positive clones obtained from a HeLa cell cDNA library contained the substrate binding domain of the Siah proteins (Siah1, 177-282; Siah2, 217-324). We examined whether PLCϵ interacts with Siah proteins in cells by using co-immunoprecipitation analysis. Both Siah1 and Siah2 were found to associate with PLCϵ in COS-7 cells (Fig. 1A), but Siah2 did not interact with PLC-γ1 or PLC-β1 (Fig. 1B). These results indicate that Siah proteins interact with PLCϵ by specifically recognizing the RA domain, which is present only in the PLCϵ isozyme. We then investigated whether endogenous PLCϵ and Siah2 can form a complex in MEF cells. As shown in Fig. 1C, Siah2 was immunoprecipitated with α-Siah2 antibody and the immunocomplex contained PLCϵ, which indicates that PLCϵ-Siah2 complex exists under physiological conditions. The RA2 Domain Contains Siah Binding Regions Distinct from the Ras Binding Region—The RA domains of PLCϵ are composed of RA1 and RA2 domains. Both domains have similar ubiquitin-like folds, but only the RA2 domain can associate with activated Ras (36Bunney T.D. Harris R. Gandarillas N.L. Josephs M.B. Roe S.M. Sorli S.C. Paterson H.F. Rodrigues-Lima F. Esposito D. Ponting C.P. Gierschik P. Pearl L.H. Driscoll P.C. Katan M. Mol. Cell. 2006; 21: 495-507Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). In the present study, we explored the binding region of the RA domains in detail. Glutathione S-transferase-pulldown analysis revealed that the RA2 domain is responsible for the interaction with Siah2, and further deletion analysis enabled us to narrow this down to several amino acids (Fig. 2A). We mutated several evolutionally conserved amino acids and examined their ability to interact with Siah2. In particular, the mutation of Lys-2186 into Ala led to the 85% inhibition of the interaction between PLCϵ and Siah2, whereas mutation of VLK (2173-2175) into AAA had little effect on the interaction with Siah2. In addition, the Ras binding-deficient mutant of PLCϵ (K2151E/K2153E) had almost the same affinity for Siah2 as did the wild type (Fig. 2B). According to previous structural analysis of the PLCϵ RA domain (36Bunney T.D. Harris R. Gandarillas N.L. Josephs M.B. Roe S.M. Sorli S.C. Paterson H.F. Rodrigues-Lima F. Esposito D. Ponting C.P. Gierschik P. Pearl L.H. Driscoll P.C. Katan M. Mol. Cell. 2006; 21: 495-507Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar), the Siah binding region of PLCϵ corresponds to the loop between β3 and β4 of the RA2 domain, which is removed from the Ras binding region (β1, β2, and the α1-β3 loop of RA2). In fact, the K2186A mutant showed no difference in binding affinity for the constitutively active H-RasV12 mutant (Fig. 2C). Taken together, these results support the possibility that the RA2 domain has a specific Siah binding region that is quite distinct from the Ras binding region. EGF Stimulation Induced the Interaction between Siah2 and PLCϵ—EGF stimulation evokes PLCϵ activity through Ras-dependent translocation to the plasma membrane (8Song C. Hu C.D. Masago M. Kariyai K. Yamawaki-Kataoka Y. Shibatohge M. Wu D. Satoh T. Kataoka T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 2752-2757Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). In the present study, we investigated whether EGF treatment affects the interaction between Siah and PLCϵ. Interestingly, EGF treatment induced an association between PLCϵ and Siah2 in COS-7 cells (Fig. 3A). The interaction was initially detected at 5 min after EGF stimulation and was most prominent at 30 min after stimulation. We then investigated whether Ras-dependent activation of PLCϵ is required for the EGF-dependent association between Siah2 and PLCϵ. To this end, PLCϵ activation was blocked by the expression of a dominant negative mutant, RasN17. The expression of the RasN17 mutant abolished EGF-dependent Siah2 binding with PLCϵ (Fig. 3B), which indicates that PLCϵ activation is required for the association with Siah2. Our findings demonstrate that Siah2 associates with activated PLCϵ after EGF stimulation. EGF Stimulation Induced the Siah-dependent Degradation of PLCϵ—Siah proteins function as E3 ubiquitin ligases and mediate the ubiquitination of various substrate molecules by direct interaction (17Li S. Li Y. Carthew R.W. Lai Z.C. Cell. 1997; 90: 469-478Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar, 18Boehm J. He T. Greiner A. Staudt L. Wirth T.

Oncogene. 2000; 19: 5997-6006Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Thus, we investigated whether the EGF-dependent association between Siah proteins and PLCϵ can lead to the ubiquitination of PLCϵ. We found that PLCϵ was efficiently ubiquitinated in COS-7 cells upon EGF stimulation (Fig. 4A). Many Siah substrates are known to be subjected to degradation by the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway (17Li S. Li Y. Carthew R.W. Lai Z.C. Cell. 1997; 90: 469-478Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar, 18Boehm J. He T. Greiner A. Staudt L. Wirth T.

Oncogene. 2000; 19: 5997-6006Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), and in the present study, the expression of Siah2 also led to the EGF-dependent degradation of PLCϵ, which was blocked by co-incubation with MG132 (a proteasomal inhibitor), indicating that Siah-mediated ubiquitination leads to the proteasomal degradation of PLCϵ (Fig. 4B). The PLCϵ K2186A mutant was not ubiquitinated by EGF stimulation (Fig. 4C). Concomitantly, the PLCϵ K2186A mutant was not efficiently degraded by EGF stimulation (Fig. 4D), which demonstrates that the interaction between PLCϵ and Siah2 is required for the EGF-induced PLCϵ degradation. These results suggest that PLCϵ is subjected to Siah-dependent ubiquitination and degradation upon EGF stimulation. The EGF-dependent Activation of Src Leads to the Phosphorylation of Siah Proteins—The growth factor-dependent ubiquitination of substrate molecules by Siah proteins has not been reported to date. We attempted to identify the upstream mediator responsible for the activation of Siah proteins upon EGF stimulation. It was recently reported that Siah1 is phosphorylated on tyrosine residues by a JNK-dependent pathway after camptothecin treatment, and that this tyrosine phosphorylation plays an important role in the stability and function of Siah1 (37Xu Z. Sproul A. Wang W. Kukekov N. Greene L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 303-312Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Thus, we examined whether EGF treatment could induce the tyrosine phosphorylation of Siah proteins. Interestingly, both Siah1 and Siah2 were found to be phosphorylated on tyrosine residues after EGF treatment in COS-7 cells (Fig. 5A). We tested several pharmacological inhibitors to identify potential upstream kinases responsible for the EGF-induced phosphorylation of Siah proteins. Src tyrosine kinase inhibitor PP2 blocked the EGF-induced phosphorylation of Siah2 (Fig. 5B), whereas the EGF-dependent phosphorylation of Siah2 was unaffected by SP600125 (a JNK inhibitor), which suggested a novel phosphorylation-dependent means of Siah protein regulation. There are five conserved tyrosine residues in Siah1 and Siah2, and Tyr-100 and Tyr-126 of Siah1 have been reported to be phosphorylated by camptothecin treatment. Thus, we investigated whether Tyr-100 and Tyr-126 of Siah1 are also phosphorylated by EGF stimulation. Mutation of both residues to phenylalanines had no effect on the EGF-dependent phosphorylation of Siah1 (Fig. 5C). Thus, we substituted Tyr-47, Tyr-199, and Tyr-223 for phenylalanine and re-examined EGF-induced phosphorylation. Individual mutations of these tyrosine residues resulted in a partial reduction of the tyrosine phosphorylation of Siah1, but the mutation of all three tyrosine residues completely blocked this phosphorylation (Fig. 5C). These results imply that Siah is phosphorylated at multiple tyrosine residues via a Src-dependent pathway after EGF stimulation. Siah Phosphorylation Is Required for the EGF-induced Degradation of PLCϵ—To elucidate the role of the Src-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation of Siah proteins, we pretreated cells with Src tyrosine kinase inhibitor PP2 before EGF stimulation and examined the ubiquitination of PLCϵ in these cells. Src inhibition led to the suppression of the EGF-dependent ubiquitination of PLCϵ, whereas pretreatment of SP600125 had no effect on PLCϵ ubiquitination (Fig. 6A). To further confirm the role of Siah phosphorylation, we utilized a phosphorylation-deficient mutant of Siah1 (Siah1 TM) that had phenylalanine substitutions at Tyr-47, Tyr-199, and Tyr-223. Siah1 TM did not effectively induce the ubiquitination of PLCϵ after EGF treatment, whereas wild-type and the Siah1 Y100F/Y126F mutant efficiently ubiquitinated PLCϵ (Fig. 6B). Concomitantly, the EGF-dependent degradation of PLCϵ was impaired in the cells transfected with Siah1 TM (Fig. 6C), as compared with the cells transfected with wild-type Siah1. Taken together, these results show that the Src-dependent phosphorylation of Siah is required for the EGF-induced ubiquitination and degradation of PLCϵ. Siah Is Required for the EGF-dependent Degradation of PLCϵ in MEFs—We attempted to determine whether the EGF-dependent degradation of PLCϵ is impaired in the absence of the Siah proteins. To this end, we utilized Siah1a/Siah2 double knockout MEF cells. PLCϵ was subjected to EGF-dependent degradation in MEF cells derived from wild-type mice (Fig. 7A, panel a), but the degradation of PLCϵ was blocked in the absence of Siah1a and Siah2 (Fig. 7A, panel b). To clarify the involvement of Siah, we expressed wild-type Siah1 or Siah1 TM in knockout cells by lentiviral infection (Fig. 7B). Add-back of wild-type Siah1 restored the EGF-dependent degradation of PLCϵ (Fig. 7A, panel c), however, the add-back of Siah1 TM did not (Fig. 7A, panel d). These results confirm the role of endogenous Siah proteins in the EGF-dependent degradation of PLCϵ. Siah Suppressed PLCϵ-induced Cell Growth—Various reports suggest that PLCϵ can promote cell growth (12Bai Y. Edamatsu H. Maeda S. Saito H. Suzuki N. Satoh T. Kataoka T. Cancer Res. 2004; 64: 8808-8810Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar, 13Song C. Satoh T. Edamatsu H. Wu D. Tadano M. Gao X. Kataoka T. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 8105-8113Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), and our previous results revealed that EGF-dependent cell growth was enhanced by PLCϵ. Thus, we speculated that the Siah-dependent degradation of PLCϵ can contribute to the negative regulation of EGF-dependent cell growth. To test this hypothesis, we first examined whether Siah1 can inhibit the EGF-dependent cell growth potentiated by PLCϵ expression. As shown in Fig. 8A, PLCϵ expression enhanced EGF-dependent cell growth in HEK293 cells and co-expression of Siah1 abolished the PLCϵ-dependent enhancement of cell growth. We then measured the EGF-dependent cell growth in Siah1a/Siah2-double knockout cells and in Siah1-add-back cells. The add-back of Siah1 in double knockout cells suppressed EGF-dependent cell growth (Fig. 8C). We then reduced PLCϵ in Siah1a/Siah1-double knockout cells and in Siah1-add-back cells to investigate whether Siah-dependent growth inhibition is attributable to PLCϵ degradation (Fig. 8B). PLCϵ reduction in double knockout cells led to EGF-dependent growth inhibition, and notably, the suppression of Siah-dependent cell growth was abolished by PLCϵ knockdown (Fig. 8C). Taken together, these results suggest that Siah inhibits EGF-dependent cell growth by removing PLCϵ. Although the activation mechanisms and physiological functions of PLCϵ have been largely revealed, little is known about the negative regulation of PLCϵ. The present study provides evidences that growth factor-activated PLCϵ is subjected to proteasomal degradation. Siah proteins interact with the RA2 domain of PLCϵ and promote PLCϵ ubiquitination in the process. Our findings demonstrate that the RA2 domain of PLCϵ plays a role in the inactivation of PLCϵ as well as in the activation of PLCϵ after growth factor stimulation. The RA2 domain of PLCϵ binds with activated Ras or Rap, and this binding is critical for the growth factor-dependent translocation to the membrane and the activation of PLCϵ (8Song C. Hu C.D. Masago M. Kariyai K. Yamawaki-Kataoka Y. Shibatohge M. Wu D. Satoh T. Kataoka T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 2752-2757Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar, 36Bunney T.D.

Cell. 2006; 21: 495-507Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). It is interesting to note that the blockade of the Ras-dependent activation of PLCϵ led to the inhibition of the EGF-dependent interaction between Siah2 and PLCϵ, which implies that PLCϵ activation may be a prerequisite for the EGF-induced ubiquitination and degradation of PLCϵ. In addition, the EGF-dependent interaction between Siah2 and PLCϵ is most prominent at 30 min after EGF stimulation (Fig. 3A), whereas the EGF-induced translocation of PLCϵ into the membrane for activation reportedly begins at 5 min after stimulation and ends at 40 min after stimulation (8Song C. Hu C.D. Masago M. Kariyai K. Yamawaki-Kataoka Y. Shibatohge M. Wu D. Satoh T. Kataoka T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 2752-2757Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar), which indicates that the Siah-induced ubiquitination of PLCϵ is induced after the activation of PLCϵ. Thus, we speculate that activated PLCϵ is subjected to Siah-dependent ubiquitination and degradation to terminate PLCϵ downstream signaling. This is the first study to explore the molecular mechanism underlying the negative regulation of PLCϵ. Several studies have reported that PLCϵ promotes cell growth. For example, carcinogen-induced tumor formation was inhibited in PLCϵ-deficient mice (12Bai Y. Edamatsu H. Maeda S. Saito H. Suzuki N. Satoh T. Kataoka T. Cancer Res. 2004; 64: 8808-8810Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar), and the overexpression of PLCϵ in BaF3 cells potentiated platelet-derived growth factor-dependent cell growth (13Song C. Satoh T. Edamatsu H. Wu D. Tadano M. Gao X. Kataoka T. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 8105-8113Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Consistent with previous reports, we found that PLCϵ knockdown in MEFs led to the suppression of EGF-dependent cell growth. We conclude that it is necessary to control the level of PLCϵ in cells to prevent aberrant cell growth. Many reports have implicated Siah proteins in cell growth control. Siah is a transcriptional target of p53 and contributes to p53-induced apoptosis and tumor suppression (23Amson R.B. Nemani M. Roperch J.P. Israeli D. Bougueleret L. Gall I.L. Medhioub M.

Moreover, β-catenin degradation by genotoxic stress was mediated by Siah1, which leads to the suppression of cancer cell growth (26Liu J. Stevens J. Rote C. Yost H. Hu Y. Neufeld K. White R. Matsunami N. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 927-936Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar, 27Matsuzawa S. Reed J. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 915-926Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (527) Google Scholar). Siah1 was also found to induce growth arrest by inhibiting cytokinesis via the degradation of kinesin (Kid) (28Bruzzoni-Giovanelli H. Faille A. Linares-Cruz G. Nemani M. Le Deist F. Germani A. Chassoux D. Millot G. Roperch J.P. Amson R. Telerman A. Calvo F. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 7101-7109Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The involvement of Siah proteins in the regulation of growth factor-dependent cell growth was newly revealed in the present study. PLCϵ was found to be a novel substrate of Siah proteins, and it was degraded by Siah proteins after EGF stimulation. We demonstrated that Siah proteins contribute to the negative regulation of growth factor-induced MEF cell growth by mediating PLCϵ degradation. The fact that PLCϵ reduction abolished Siah-dependent growth inhibition (Fig. 7) suggests that PLCϵ is a major substrate of Siah proteins, which needs to be degraded to regulate cell growth in MEF cells. The present study suggests a novel regulatory mechanism for Siah-mediated substrate degradation. We found that the Src-dependent phosphorylation of Siah is required for the EGF-induced degradation of PLCϵ. Whether Src directly phosphorylates Siah proteins or activates other protein kinases remains unclear. Previous reports have shown that Siah proteins are phosphorylated in different environments. For example, Siah2 was phosphorylated on Thr-24 and Ser-29 by p38 MAPK under hypoxia, and this was found to be important for the degradation of PHD-3 (38Khurana A. Nakayama K. Williams S. Davis R.J. Mustelin T. Ronai Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 35316-35326Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Greene et al. (37Xu Z. Sproul A. Wang W. Kukekov N. Greene L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 303-312Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) reported that Siah1 is phosphorylated on Tyr-100 and Tyr-126 upon camptothecin treatment via the activation of the JNK pathway. This phosphorylation increased the stability of Siah1 and its association with the adaptor protein POSH. Our analysis revealed that Siah1 is phosphorylated on Tyr-47, Tyr-199, and Tyr-223 via Src activation. We speculate that the EGF-induced phosphorylation of Siah proteins contributes to the binding of proteins with PLCϵ and the subsequent degradation of PLCϵ, because pretreatment with the Src tyrosine kinase inhibitor PP2 reduced the EGF-induced interaction between PLCϵ and Siah proteins as well as the ubiquitination of PLCϵ (data not shown). Thus, Siah phosphorylation appears to be an important regulatory mode that mediates various interactions with substrate molecules or adaptor proteins in different cellular contexts. In summary, we identified Siah1 and Siah2 as negative regulators of PLCϵ. PLCϵ is subjected to EGF-dependent degradation via Siah-induced ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation processes. Siah is phosphorylated by EGF stimulation, and this phosphorylation is required for PLCϵ degradation. Physiologically, the Siah-induced degradation of PLCϵ contributes to the negative regulation of the EGF-dependent cell growth potentiated by PLCϵ."
https://openalex.org/W1991127135,"Cooperation of CD4+ T helper cells with specific B cells is crucial for protective vaccination against pathogens by inducing long-lived neutralizing antibody responses. During infection with persistence-prone viruses, prolonged virus replication correlates with low neutralizing antibody responses. We recently described that a viral mutant of lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV), which lacks a T helper epitope, counterintuitively induced an enhanced protective antibody response. Likewise, partial depletion of the CD4+ T cell compartment by using anti-CD4 antibodies enhanced protective antibodies.Here we have developed a protocol to selectively reduce the CD4+ T cell response against viral CD4+ T cell epitopes. We demonstrate that in vivo treatment with LCMV-derived MHC-II peptides induced non-responsiveness of specific CD4+ T cells without affecting CD4+ T cell reactivity towards other antigens. This was associated with accelerated virus-specific neutralizing IgG-antibody responses. In contrast to a complete absence of CD4+ T cell help, tolerisation did not impair CD8+ T cell responses.This result reveals a novel ""negative vaccination"" strategy where specific CD4+ T cell unresponsiveness may be used to enhance the delayed protective antibody responses in chronic virus infections."
https://openalex.org/W2001116000,"Flavodoxin is an essential protein for Helicobacter pylori, a pathogen living in the very acidic environment of the gastric tract and responsible for several diseases. We report the conformational stability of the protein in neutral and acidic pH. The apoprotein remains native between pH 12 and 5 and adopts a monomeric molten globule conformation at more acidic pH values. The equilibrium unfolding in urea appears two-state for either conformation, but the native one coexists with a hidden equilibrium intermediate of very similar properties. The stability of H. pylori apoflavodoxin is higher than that of the Anabaena homologue throughout the entire pH interval, which may be related to better charge compensation. H. pylori apoflavodoxin is strongly stabilized by its FMN cofactor. A global analysis of apo- and holoflavodoxin equilibrium unfolding, with and without excess FMN, indicates that the cofactor only binds to the native state. Some physical-chemical properties of the protein may represent an adaptation to the acidic environment. Unlike the apoflavodoxin from Anabaena, which becomes highly insoluble at pH 5.0, that from H. pylori remains soluble to at least 40 μm. This fact, together with the high stability of the apoprotein at this low pH that can arise in the bacteria cytoplasm, seems useful to allow newly synthesized apoflavodoxin molecules to fold and remain soluble to accomplish cofactor binding, which in turn increases the stability. Also, whenever the cytoplasmic pH drops to 5, preexisting flavodoxin molecules will remain folded and soluble and will retain the FMN cofactor, thus remaining functional.

Flavodoxins are bacterial electron-transfer proteins that bear a noncovalently bound redox cofactor (FMN) that allows them to participate in a variety of reactions (1Sancho J. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2006; 63: 855-864Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). There is evidence that, in vivo, the apoprotein folds first and then binds the cofactor, and it is clear that when the cofactor is removed, the apoprotein remains folded (2Rao S.T. Shaffie F. Yu C.

Recently, it has been reported that the flavodoxin from H. pylori is essential for the survival of the pathogen because of its role as electron acceptor of the pyruvate-flavodoxin oxidoreductase complex, which catalyzes pyruvate oxidative decarboxylation (9Hughes N.J. Chalk P.A. Clayton C.L. Kelly D.J. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 3953-3959Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Conversely, flavodoxin is the electron donor in the reverse reaction that is used to fix CO2 (10St Maurice M. Cremades N. Croxen M.A. Sisson G. Sancho J. Hoffman P.S. J. Bacteriol. 2007; 189: 4764-4773Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The x-ray structure of the protein is available for both the apo-(11Martínez-Júlvez M. Cremades N. Bueno M.

H. pylori flavodoxin contains 164 residues, including two tryptophans, and shares 40% sequence identity with Anabaena PCC7119 and Azotobacter vinelandii, and 30% with Desulfovibrio desulfuricans and Desulfovibrio vulgaris flavodoxins. Interestingly, H pylori flavodoxin lacks a fairly conserved tryptophan residue involved in FMN binding in many flavodoxins and bears instead an alanine residue, which creates an exposed pocket near the redox cofactor (12Freigang J. Diederichs K. Schafer K.P. Welte W. Paul R. Protein Sci. 2002; 11: 253-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) that is being used to target small inhibitory molecules (13Cremades N. Bueno M.

In thermal unfolding, all apoflavodoxins studied seem to populate at moderate temperatures an intermediate conformation (14Campos L.A. Bueno M. Lopez-Llano J. Jimenez M.A. Sancho J. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 344: 239-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). In contrast, the chemical unfolding has revealed a less homogeneous behavior. The only apoflavodoxin studied by urea denaturation (Anabaena) follows a two-state model (3Genzor C.G. Beldarrain A. Gomez-Moreno C. Lopez-Lacomba J.L. Cortijo M. Sancho J. Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 1376-1388Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), whereas by using guanidinium hydrochloride, three apoflavodoxins have been investigated, and different models have been proposed (15Campos L.A.

We report here the conformational stability of H. pylori flavodoxin in a wide pH interval to try to understand how the protein can remain functional at moderately acidic pH values where flavodoxin is expected to be either aggregated or highly insoluble (3Genzor C.G. Beldarrain A. Gomez-Moreno C. Lopez-Lacomba J.L. Cortijo M. Sancho J. Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 1376-1388Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), and as a contribution to understanding the some-what controversial equilibrium and binding behavior of the flavodoxin family. According to our analysis, H. pylori apoflavodoxin remains folded in a wide pH interval and adopts a monomeric molten globule conformation at low pH. Near the isoelectric point, its conformational stability is similar to that of Anabaena apoflavodoxin, but its solubility is far higher. A global analysis of the unfolding of the apo- and holo-forms, with and without excess FMN, shows that only the native state can interact with the cofactor. Overall, it seems that although apoflavodoxins share a fairly common thermal unfolding mechanism (14Campos L.A. Bueno M. Lopez-Llano J. Jimenez M.A. Sancho J. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 344: 239-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 17van Mierlo C.P. van Dongen W.M. Vergeldt F. van Berkel W.J. Steensma E.

Sci. 2006; 31: 494-496Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) to thermal and chemical stresses. Importantly, the apoflavodoxin from H. pylori remains folded, soluble. and in an FMN-competent state at the fairly low pH values that can arise in the cytoplasm (27Stingl K. Uhlemann E.M. Schmid R. Altendorf K. Bakker E.P. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 3053-3060Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) of the pathogen, and the holoprotein is highly stable. Protein Purification—Recombinant H. pylori flavodoxin was purified from a culture of Escherichia coli cells (BL21) harboring plasmid pET28a, which contains the flavodoxin gene (13Cremades N. Bueno M. Toja M. Sancho J. Biophys. Chem. 2005; 115: 267-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The cells were disrupted by sonication in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, and the supernatant was brought to 60% saturated (NH4)2SO4, centrifuged, and loaded onto a DE52 DEAE-cellulose column, previously equilibrated with 60% saturated (NH4)2SO4 in 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8. Flavodoxin was then eluted with a linear gradient from 60 to 0% saturated ammonium sulfate in the same buffer. Flavodoxin fractions were poured onto a DE52 DEAE-cellulose column, previously equilibrated with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8. A purified flavodoxin was eluted with a linear gradient from 0 to 0.5 m NaCl in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8. Finally, the apo- and holo-forms of flavodoxin were separated and concentrated in a Mono Q10 column (GE Healthcare) equilibrated with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, from where they were eluted with a linear gradient from 0 to 1 m NaCl. The purity of the protein was monitored by SDS-PAGE and by recording its absorption spectrum. Apoflavodoxin was also obtained by removing the flavin mononucleotide group from the holoprotein by apoprotein precipitation with trichloroacetic acid (28Edmondson D.E. Tollin G. Biochemistry. 1971; 10: 124-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Spectroscopic Characterization—Fluorescence emission and far-UV and near-UV CD spectra were acquired at 298 ± 0.1 K at several pH values in both native and denaturing conditions (6 m urea or 363 K). Fluorescence emission spectra (300 to 400 nm) were recorded, exciting at 280 nm, using spectropolarimeters (from Applied Photophysics). Protein samples at different pH values were prepared by mixing concentrated buffer and protein solutions. Apoflavodoxin concentrations were 2-20 μm for fluorescence, 20 μm for far-UV CD experiments, and 20-40 μm for near-UV CD. All final buffer solutions were of a 10 mm ionic strength. For fluorescence and near-UV CD, a 1-cm path length cuvette was used, and for far-UV CD, a 0.1-cm path length cuvette was used. Binding of ANS 3The abbreviations used are: ANS1-anilino-8-naphthalenesulfonateMOPS4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acidCHES2-(cyclohexylamino)ethanesulfonic acid. to apoflavodoxin was measured, as a function of pH, by recording emission fluorescence at 495 nm (excitation at 396 nm). Apoflavodoxin and ANS concentrations were 2 and 250 μm, respectively. 1-anilino-8-naphthalenesulfonate 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid 2-(cyclohexylamino)ethanesulfonic acid. Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy—All NMR experiments were performed on a Bruker DRX-500 spectrometer equipped with a triple resonance probe and z-pulse field gradients. The temperature probe was regularly calibrated by using methanol and ethylene glycol (29Cavanagh J.F. Wayne J. Palmer A.G. II I Skelton J.J. Protein NMR Spectroscopy: Principles and Practice. Academic Press, San Diego1996: 31-36Google Scholar). Diffusion Measurements (DOSY Experiments)—Translational self-diffusion measurements were performed using the pulsed gradient spin-echo NMR method. The theoretical and experimental aspects of pulsed gradient spin-echo NMR have been extensively reviewed (30Price W.S. Concepts Magn. Reson. 1997; 9: 299-336Crossref Google Scholar, 31Price W.S. Concepts Magn. Reson. 1998; 10: 197-237Crossref Scopus (504) Google Scholar). Briefly, if during the time between two applied gradient pulses, a molecule moves along the z axis, when its magnetization is brought back to x axis, it will not refocus completely, and the nuclei resonances will be attenuated. If the molecule diffuses rapidly, the attenuation of its resonances will be large. Conversely, if diffusion is slow, the attenuation will be small. The relationship between the self-diffusion coefficient, D, and the measured NMR parameters is shown in Equation 1, I/I0=-exp(Dγ2δ2G2(Δ-δ/3))(Eq. 1) where I is the measured peak intensity (or volume) of a particular (or a group of) resonance(s); I0 is the maximum peak intensity of the same resonance(s) at the smaller gradient strength; D is the translational self-diffusion constant (in cm2 s-1); δ is the duration (in seconds) of the gradient; G is the strength of the gradient (in T cm-1); Δ is the time (in seconds) between the two gradients (i.e. the time when the molecule evolves); and γ is the gyromagnetic ratio of a proton (2.675 × 104 G-1 s-1). The translational diffusion coefficient can be related to the molecular weight and the shape of the macromolecule. The Stokes-Einstein equation relates D to the molecular shape via the so-called friction coefficient, f, as shown in Equation 2, D=kT/f(Eq. 2) where T is the temperature and k the Boltzmann constant. The friction coefficient of a protein is determined by its overall dimensions, hydration, and surface roughness of the surface exposed to water. Assuming the protein adopts a spherical shape, the friction coefficient follows Equation 3, f=6πηR(Eq. 3) where R is the hydrodynamic radius of the sphere, and η is the viscosity of the solvent. Combining Equations 2 and 3, the hydrodynamic radius can be obtained as shown in Equation 4, R=kT/6πηD(Eq. 4) The viscosity of a macromolecular solution is very weakly influenced by the macromolecule component at low macromolecular concentrations, and therefore, the viscosity of the solution should be that of the solvent. Solvent viscosity is temperature-dependent according to Ref. 32Lapham J. Rife J.P. Moore P.B. Crothers D.M. J. Biomol. NMR. 1997; 10: 255-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, logη = a + (b/(c - T)). The terms a, b, and c for a 100% 2H2O solution are a =-4.2911, b = -164.97, and c = 174.24, which yields a value of η = 1.095 kg/(cm s) at 298 K. In our experiments, a 5-mm triple resonance inverse probe with z-gradients was used. The gradient strength was calibrated using the diffusion rate for the residual proton water line in a sample containing 100% 2H2O in a 5-mm tube, and back-calculating G. This procedure assumes that the diffusion rate for HDO in a 100% 2H2O sample is 1.94 × 10-5 cm2 s-1 at 298 K (32Lapham J. Rife J.P. Moore P.B. Crothers D.M. J. Biomol. NMR. 1997; 10: 255-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Experiments were acquired by using the longitudinal pulse field gradient eddy current delay pulse sequence. Each experiment was averaged over 128 scans, and the number of points was 16 K. A post-gradient eddy current relaxation delay of 5 ms was used in all the experiments. The strength of the gradients was varied from 2% of the total power of the gradient coil to 95%, and their shape was a sine function. The duration of the gradient was varied between 3 and 2.2 ms, and the time between both gradients was changed between 100 and 150 ms. The resonances used to measure the changes of the intensity were those of the most upfield-shifted methyl groups (from 0.8 to 1.5 ppm). Histidine pKa Determination—One-dimensional proton NMR spectra of apoflavodoxin solutions at different pH values were recorded to determine the chemical shifts of the resonances corresponding to the two histidine residues in the protein. To allow for complete H-D exchange of amide protons, protein samples were first incubated at pH 11.5 for 15 min in 90% D2O. The required pH of each sample was then set by adding 50 μl of buffer in D2O. The buffers used were at a final 50 mm concentration as follows: pH 2.0-3.0, deuterated glycine; pH 3.0-5.5, deuterated acetic acid; pH 6.0-7.0, NaH2PO4;pH 7.5-9.0, deuterated Tris acid; and pH 9.5-12. The actual pH of the samples was measured with a thin Aldrich electrode in a radiometer (Copenhagen) pH-meter before and after recording the spectrum. No corrections were done for the isotope effect. The one-dimensional spectra were acquired with 32 K data points, averaged over 2 K scans with 6000 Hz of spectral width (12 ppm), with water suppression achieved by WATERGATE (33Piotto M. Saudek V. Sklenar V. J. Biomol. NMR. 1992; 2: 661-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (3536) Google Scholar). Base-line correction and zero-filling were applied for all pH values with the same parameters. Spectra were referenced to an external frequency. Histidine resonances were analyzed (34Sancho J. Serrano L. Fersht A.R. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 2253-2258Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 35Loewenthal R. Sancho J. Fersht A.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 224: 759-770Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar) assuming that the protonated and deprotonated species contributed to the observed chemical shifts according to Equation 5, δ=δa+δb×10(pH-pKa)1+10(pH-pKa)(Eq. 5) where δ is the chemical shift observed at a particular pH; δa is the chemical shift being observed for the acidic species; δb is the chemical shift observed at high pH values, and pKa is the apparent pK of the corresponding histidine. C2H protons of the imidazole rings were followed. Detection of C4H resonances in the one-dimensional spectra was precluded by the many aromatic residues present in the protein. Urea-induced Unfolding—The chemical stability of the apoprotein has been characterized in a wide pH interval (between 1 and 12 every 0.5 pH units) using urea as denaturing agent. Samples were prepared by mixing 900-μl urea solutions with 100-μl aliquots of buffered apoflavodoxin to obtain protein samples of 2 μm (for fluorescence experiments) or 20 μm (for far- and near-UV dichroism experiments) at the desired pH and urea concentrations. The different buffers used were prepared so that the ionic strength was always 10 mm, and the protein samples were equilibrated at 298 K for at least 30 min before recording the spectroscopic signal. Unfolding was followed throughout the entire pH interval, by emission fluorescence (ratio of 320/360 nm emission with excitation at 280 nm). A ratio of emission signals at two wavelengths was used to minimize protein concentration errors. In some cases, this can give rise to inaccuracies in the Tm values. However, when the reference wavelength is chosen so that the signal does not change with the unfolding transition (as is the case of 360 nm for H. pylori apoflavodoxin), the ratio of intensities quantitatively follows the advance of the reaction (36Lopez-Llano J. Campos L.A. Bueno M. Sancho J. J. Mol. Biol. 2006; 356: 354-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). In addition, the unfolding equilibrium was also followed by CD at 222 nm (far-UV) and 291 nm (near-UV) at pH 2, 5, 7, and 9. Unfolding data were analyzed as described (37Pace C.N. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 131: 266-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (2424) Google Scholar, 38Santoro M.M. Bolen D.W. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 8063-8068Crossref PubMed Scopus (1608) Google Scholar), assuming a two-state equilibrium where the free energy of unfolding, ΔG, is considered to be a linear function of denaturant concentration, [D], as shown in Equation 6, ΔG=ΔGw-m[D](Eq. 6) where ΔGw is the free energy of unfolding in buffered water, and m is a proportionality constant. The spectroscopic signals of the folded and unfolded states (SF and SU at 0 m urea) are assumed to vary linearly with urea concentration, mF and mU being the corresponding slopes. Thus, the observed spectroscopic signal was fitted to the following Equation 7, S=SF+mF[D]+(SU+mU[D])e-(ΔGw-m[D])/RT1+e-(ΔGw-m[D])/RT(Eq. 7) where R is the gas constant and T the absolute temperature. Analysis of Proton Linkage—Conformational stability values obtained by chemical denaturation at different pH values were fitted to Equation 7, which links stability and pH as shown in Equation 8, ΔG=ΔG0-∑iniRTln1+10pKa,jU-pH1+10pKa,iN-pH(Eq. 8) where different i groups of ionizable residues have been considered. pKUa and pKNa are the mean pKa values for a specific group of residues i in the unfolded and folded protein, respectively; ni is the number of residues with a change in pKa upon unfolding large enough to promote variations in the proton fraction between states, and ΔG0 is the hypothetical stability value when the protein is completely unprotonated. From the experimental curve shape (see Fig. 4b), at least three transitions are expected, i.e. i = 3. The number of excess bound protons in the native state relative to the unfolded one was estimated to be, as a function of pH, as indicated in Equation 9, ΔNTH=∑iΔNi=∑ini(χU,iH-χN,iH)=∑ini10(pKa,iU-pH)1+10(pKa,iU-pH)-10(pKa,iN-pH)1+10(pKa,iN-pH)(Eq. 9) where Ni is the number of bound protons of each titratable group of residues (for H. pylori apoflavodoxin i = 3, as has been mentioned); ni is the number of titratable residues in each group; χHU,i and χHN,i are the proton fractions of each residue bound to the unfolded and native state, respectively; and pKUa,i and pKNa,i the mean pK values for each group of residues. Guanidinium-induced Unfolding—The influence of FMN cofactor binding in protein stability was studied using guanidinium hydrochloride as denaturant. The unfolding of apoflavodoxin, holoflavodoxin, and holoflavodoxin with 93 μm excess FMN in 50 mm MOPS, pH 7, was monitored. The unfolding of apoflavodoxin was observed by far-UV CD at 225 nm and fluorescence emission at 320 nm (exciting at 280 nm). For holoflavodoxin, the CD signals at 225, 291, and 373 nm, as well as fluorescence emission at 350 nm (exciting at 280 nm) and at 525 nm (exciting at 453 nm), were used to follow the reaction. In the experiment with excess FMN, the unfolding was recorded by far-UV (225 nm), near-UV (291 nm), and visible CD (373 nm). In all cases, the protein concentration used was 20 μm. In CD measurements, the buffer ellipticity was subtracted from that of the samples. A global analysis of all the guanidinium-induced unfolding curves of apo- and holoflavodoxin, with and without excess FMN, was performed according to a two-state unfolding model (Equation 7) coupled with ligand binding to the native state for holoflavodoxin curves. Both the binding and folding equilibria are assumed to display free energy differences that are linearly dependent on denaturant concentration as shown in Equation 10, Ki(D)=Ki0×emi[D]/RT(Eq. 10) FMN is assumed to bind only to the native state, so that protein stability corresponds to the stability in the absence of ligand plus an additional term, ΔGB as shown in Equation 11, ΔGB=RTln(1+[L]/KD)(Eq. 11) where KD is the dissociation constant of the protein-ligand complex that varies with denaturation agent concentration according to Equation 10, and [L], the concentration of free ligand, is given by Equation 12, [L]=[L]T1+[N]/KD(Eq. 12) where [L]T is total ligand concentration, and [N] is native state concentration, which varies according to Equation 13, [N]=-(KD(1+KNU)+[L]T-PT)2+(1+KNU)+(KD(1+KNU)+[L]T-PT)+4(1+KNU)(-KDPT)2(1+KNU)(Eq. 13) where PT is the total protein concentration, and KNU is the protein unfolding equilibrium constant. Therefore, the partition function of the system (Q) and the population of each state (FN, FNL, FU, corresponding to apo, holo and unfolded flavodoxin, respectively) are given by Equations 14 and 15, Q=1+[L]/KD+KNU(Eq. 14) FN=1/Q;FNL=[L]/(KD×Q);FU=KNU/Q(Eq. 15) Spectroscopic characterization of apoflavodoxin-fluorescence emission and far-UV and near-UV circular dichroism spectra of apoflavodoxin were recorded at pH 2, 5, 7, 9, and 12 under “native” (298 K and no denaturant) and denaturing conditions (Fig. 1). The fluorescence emission spectra of apoflavodoxin (Fig. 1a) at pH 5, 7, and 9 under native conditions are similar in emission maximum (323-325 nm) and quantum yield. At pH 2, however, the quantum yield is reduced, and the emission maximum is slightly shifted to 329 nm. Heating to 363 K shifts the maximum of the samples to around 346 nm (except at pH 5, where the protein aggregates at high temperatures). At pH 12, under native conditions, the emission maximum is at 341 nm and shifts to 349 nm when heated to 363 K. Addition of 6 m urea, at any pH, shifts the maximum to 351 nm. Circular dichroism spectra in the far-UV (Fig. 1b) indicate that, under native conditions apoflavodoxin contains a substantial amount of secondary structure at all pH values tested, except at pH 12. The shape of the spectrum is, nevertheless, different at pH 2, which could be because of a combination of a reduced contribution of aromatic residues to the spectrum (4Genzor C.G. Perales-Alcon A. Sancho J. Romero A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 329-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 39Vuilleumier S. Sancho J. Loewenthal R. Fersht A.R. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 10303-10313Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar) and of a slightly lower helical content (75% of that at neutral pH). Both heating and addition of 6 m urea strongly unfolds the protein at all pH values tested. Near-UV CD spectra are very similar at pH 5, 7, and 9. Compared with the spectrum of the four-tryptophan containing Anabaena apoflavodoxin (3Genzor C.G. Beldarrain A. Gomez-Moreno C. Lopez-Lacomba J.L. Cortijo M. Sancho J. Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 1376-1388Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), they show a small signal consisting of three distinct peaks at 265, 287, and 295 nm. At pH 2 the signal is totally lost, and the protein shows a flat near-UV CD spectrum. The 1H NMR spectrum at pH 7 shows a well dispersed amide region and several high field methyl resonances (Fig. 2), which is indicative of a well defined tertiary structure, and the spectrum at pH 5.0 is very similar. At pH 12, the high field resonances have disappeared, and the dispersion of the aromatic and amide protons is reduced. At pH 2, the spectrum is considerably similar to that at pH 12, indicating the loss of the vast majority of the tertiary contacts, although some shoulders can be observed in the high field region, specifically at 0.4, 0.65, and 0.75 ppm; furthermore, the signals are broader than those observed at pH 12. Upon addition of 6 m urea, the broad lines observed at pH 2 in the methyl region sharpen (Fig. 2), and all the aromatic protons cluster between 7.0 and 7.5 ppm (not shown). The affinity of ANS for proteins increases when hydropho"
https://openalex.org/W2158474906,"The MYC/MAX/MAD network of transcriptional regulators controls distinct aspects of cell physiology, including cell proliferation and apoptosis. Within the network MAD proteins antagonize the functions of MYC oncoproteins, and the latter are deregulated in the majority of human cancers. While MYC sensitizes cells to proapoptotic signals, the transcriptional repressor MAD1 inhibits apoptosis in response to a broad range of stimuli, including oncoproteins. The molecular targets of MAD1 that mediate inhibition of apoptosis are not known. Here we describe the phosphatase and tensin homologue deleted on chromosome ten (PTEN) tumor suppressor gene as a target of MAD1. By binding to the proximal promoter region, MAD1 downregulated PTEN expression. PTEN functions as a lipid phosphatase that regulates the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/AKT pathway. Indeed MAD1-dependent repression of PTEN led to activation of AKT and subsequent stimulation of the antiapoptotic NF-kappaB pathway. Interfering with AKT function affected the control of Fas-induced apoptosis by MAD1. In addition, knockdown of PTEN using small interfering RNA (siRNA) or the lack of PTEN rendered cells insensitive to inhibition of apoptosis by MAD1. These findings identify the PTEN gene as a target of the MYC-antagonist MAD1 and provide a molecular framework critical for the ability of MAD1 to inhibit apoptosis."
