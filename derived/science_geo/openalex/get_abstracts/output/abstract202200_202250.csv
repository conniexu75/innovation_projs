https://openalex.org/W2017460163,"The concept of immunological specificity based on a unique combination of natural globulins is an attractive alternative to the classical concept of unique globulin molecules for each possible antigen. Many hitherto separate facets of the antibody response such as antibody diversity, cross-reactions, natural antibodies, increased mitoses in lymphatic tissue, the anamnestic response, and immune tolerance may be related through the general thesis that antibody production is not a unique biological phenomenon but a highly specialized example of certain general cellular processes."

https://openalex.org/W2035559293,"The isotonic shortening of glycerol-extracted preparations of molluscan catch muscles is inhibited at pH's and ionic strengths at which extracted paramyosin crystallizes. The isometric tension development is hardly altered under the same conditions. Consequently, the ""catch mechanism"" is explained on the basis of the crystallization of paramyosin."
https://openalex.org/W1979228564,"The interpretive cortex has in it a mechanism for instant reactivation of the detailed record of the past. It has a mechanism also for the production of interpretive signals. Such signals could only be significant if past records are scanned and relevant experiences are selected for comparison with present experience. This is a subconscious process. But it may well be that this scanning of past experience and selection from it also renders the relevant past available for conscious consideration as well. Thus, the individual may refer to the record as he employs other circuits of the brain. Access to the record of the past seems to be as readily available from the temporal cortex of one side as from that of the other. Auditory illusions (or interpretations of the distance, loudness, or tempo of sounds) have been produced by stimulation of the temporal cortex of either side. The same is true of illusional emotions, such as fear and disgust. But, on the contrary, visual illusions (interpretations of the distance, dimension, erectness, and tempo of things seen) are only produced by stimulation of the temporal cortex on the nondominant (normally, right) side of the brain. Illusions of recognition, such as familiarity or strangeness, were also elicited only from the nondominant side, except in one case."
https://openalex.org/W1984067202,"Synthesis of DNA occurs in the nurse cell nuclei of Drosophila melanogaster in an asynchronous manner, whereas synthesis of RNA occurs in all these nuclei simultaneously. Synthesized RNA is concentrated in the plasmosomes; subsequently nuclear RNA enters the cytoplasm of the nurse cell and eventually the o√∂plasm. Protein synthesis occurs in the nucleoplasm and cytoplasm of all the cells in the egg chamler."
https://openalex.org/W2020015376,"In a group of 817 individuals inducted into the U.S. Army, serum uric acid concentration was measured. The values were compared with scores secured on intelligence tests used at the Army reception center. A significant but low level of positive correlation between the two sets of values was found."
https://openalex.org/W1967681820,830 patients receiving 1 oral contraceptive tablet/day (10 mg noreth ynodrel plus .15 mg ethinyl estradiol 3-methyl ether) from Cycle Days 5 through 24 were studied for effects upon fertility menstrual phenomena and health. The mean cycle length was 28.6 days. Breakthrough bleeding occurred in only 2% of the cycles. 46% of the cycles showed no change in menstrual flow 48% showed a decrease and 6% showed an increase. Side reactions of nausea headache dizziness vomiting gastralgia and malaise declined to low levels after the 1st cycle. 200 pelvic examinations revealed a normal size involuted postpartum uteri even after 30 or more cycles of treatment an inconsistent change in the amount of cervical erosion and no pathological changes of the adnexae or vagina. Little difference was noted between the efficacy of 10 and 5 mg dosages. Practically 100% contraception occurred when the regimen wa s practiced faithfully. When 1-5 tablets were missed 5 pregnancies/10 0 woman-years occurred and when 6-19 tablets were missed 11 pregnancies/100 woman-years were noted. 32-50% of the patients who withdrew from the regimen did so because of reactions or lack of interes t. No impairment of fertility was noted in either short- or long-term users.
https://openalex.org/W1969039667,"The administration of monoamine oxidase inhibitors produces an increase in the urinary excretion of many amines for which efficient alternate routes of metabolism are not available. These include tryptamine, paratyramine, and a ""metatyramine-like"" substance. The inhibitors can therefore be used to detect previously unsuspected pathways of amino acid decarboxylation. The finding that the excretions of norepinephrine, epinephrine, 3,4-dihydroxyphenylethylamine, and possible serotonin are not appreciably affected are consistent with previous reports of the existence of alternative metabolic routes."
https://openalex.org/W2021575904,"The high potency of phloretin as a competitive inhibitor of the human red cell's monosaccharide transport system is not shared by any of several molecular fragments of phloretin, but is duplicated in certain artificial estrogens resembling phloretin in respect to the spacing between terminal phenolic -OH groups. Related molecules which are slightly less extendible are comparatively inactive."
https://openalex.org/W2058534804,"The rates at which white rats licked saline, sucrose, and saccharin solutions, respectively, were measured by cumulative recording of tongue contacts with the solution in question. The local rate of licking was constant for all solutions, but differences in the distribution of sustained periods of licking were related to the type and concentration of the fluid consumed."

https://openalex.org/W2075052809,"The presence of so-called sex chromatin has been demonstrated in the interphase nuclei of the cells of the domestic chicken (Gallus domesticus). Definite sex dimorphism was observed for the incidence of this nuclear component; the frequency of its occurrence in females was at least ten times that of its occurrence in the males, ranging from 22 percent in the duodenal muscle cells to 52 percent in the epidermal cells of a growing feather."

https://openalex.org/W2000488131,"The unresponsiveness of the golden hamster to colchicine has been shown to be the result of a resistance of individual cells to the drug. This resistance makes it possible to use hamsters with heterotransplanted tumors for testing the in vivo effects of colchicine on the tumors, with no toxic host reactions."
https://openalex.org/W2057554470,"Mice vaccinated intraperitoneally with a water-in-oil emulsion containing ovalbumin and avirulent tubercle bacilli developed strong immediate and delayed hypersensitivities, demonstrable by intracutaneous injection, to the ovalbumin. The two types of hypersensitivity could be differentiated by gross characteristics as well as by passive-transfer experiments with cells and serum from actively sensitized donors."
https://openalex.org/W2029708435,"Coumarin, usually regarded as an inhibitor of growth processes in plants, markedly stimulated the elongation of excised segments of Helianthus hypocotyls. Substitution in the molecule of hydroxy-, methyl-, or chloro-groups, in the neighborhood of the unsaturated bond in the lactone ring, markedly altered the growth-promoting activity."
https://openalex.org/W1982061026,"Pain that arises from very different pathological origins responds in a quantitative fashion to a given dose of a given narcotic, but this is not true when the pain has been contrived by experimental means, in man, with customary techniques."
https://openalex.org/W2044378836,"Concentric microelectrodes were used to voltage-clamp spinal motoneurons. With depolarizing voltage steps, current transients often appear, with some latency and in all-or-none fashion. Voltage-current relations indicate a two- to threefold reduction in resistance between inside and outside when the cell fires. These results suggest that activity does not involve the whole soma-dendritic membrane."
https://openalex.org/W1999691383,"The effects of elevated O(2) and CO(2) concentrations on the occurrence of experimental keratogenic metaplasia in the chorion of the chick embryo were examined. Exposure to oxygen resulted in advanced keratinization of the chorion; carbon dioxide at elevated concentrations, in mixtures with air or oxygen, repressed the appearance of metaplastic changes, and the chorion retained its respiratory characteristics. The evidence reported here suggests that reduction of the CO(2) content in the gaseous environment of the chorion is causally contributory to the onset of the metaplastic events."
https://openalex.org/W2012155242,"The conversion of protoporphyrin and iron to heme is catalyzed by a soluble enzyme prepared from rat liver. This reaction is inhibited by bilirubin, and initial kinetic studies suggest that the inhibition is due in part to a competition between protoporphyrin and the bile pigment. Implications of this finding in hyperbilirubinemia are mentioned."
https://openalex.org/W2017552115,"Changes in serous and encephalic serotonin in hypophysectomized or adrenalectomized rats have been observed. Adrenalectomy produces a decrease of serous serotonin and an increase of the serotonin of hemispheres, base, and medulla oblongata; with hypophysectomy, serotonin is also reduced in serum and increased only in the base and medulla oblongata."
https://openalex.org/W2051405056,"The dual control by substrate and hormone of the level of a third adaptive enzyme in animals is described. Injections of hydrocortisone or the substrate tryptophan increased the level of the liver tryptophan-alpha-ketoglutarate transaminase of intact rats within 5 hours. In adrenalectomized rats this enzyme level was increased by hydrocortisone alone, but substrate induction could be demonstrated only if these animals were treated at the same time with hydrocortisone."
https://openalex.org/W2084020498,"Spraying tomatoes with 0.3 percent sodium 2,3-dichloroisobutyrate (FW-450) at anthesis induced male sterility for 12 days, beginning 12 days after treatment. Only 20 percent fewer fruits were set on treated plants hand-pollinated with pollen from unsprayed plants than were set on untreated plants. The flowers again showed normal fertility 37 days after treatment."
https://openalex.org/W1981859903,"Diisopropylfluorophosphate inhibited all the sulfhydryl proteases studied in our tests. This inhibition was most pronounced at pH 6.0. By first blocking the sulfhydryl group with p-chloromercuribenzoate, inhibition could be prevented. Neither cysteine nor choline gave appreciable reactivation of diisopropylfluorophosphate-inhibited bromelain."
https://openalex.org/W2060926391,"By the use of bomb-produced tungsten-185 tracer, debris from the 1958 nuclear tests (Hardtack) held at the U.S. Pacific Proving Ground have been identified as they appeared in the ground-level air along the 80th meridian. A large amount of radioactivity from these tests appeared in South America, particularly at the high-altitude collecting stations."
https://openalex.org/W2009163859,"The tritium labeling of organic compounds by the Wilzbach technique-that is, by simple exposure of the compound to tritium gas-is greatly accelerated by the simultaneous exposure of the system to a silent electrical discharge. The incorporation of tritium into benzene was increased by a factor of about 10(4) without undue decomposition. Cobalt-60 gamma-rays were found to be far less useful for increasing the tritium incorporation."
https://openalex.org/W1970819139,Responses were recorded simultaneously from a number of electrodes on the auditory cortex of one hemisphere of cats. Response amplitudes at different electrodes reached maxima and minima at different real or apparent locations of a click stimulus.
https://openalex.org/W1978220088,"It seems likely that turbulence under natural conditions, both aquatic and terrestrial, is higher than it is in the bottles or leaf chambers used when photosynthesis is measured experimentally. Most of the maximal photosynthetic rates reported in the literature are probably lower than those which occur in nature."
https://openalex.org/W2025660856,"Studies show that the adsorption of rabbit antiovalbumin-I(131) on guinea-pig ileum conforms to a Langmuirian isotherm, and that the physiological response to challenge with antigen depends upon the amount of antibody bound to the tissue."
https://openalex.org/W2050547617,It is estimated that the global deposition of strontium-90 increased from 1.9 to 2.6 megacuries during the period from June 1957 to October 1958. During this time the stratospheric reservoir of strontium-90 increased from 1.4 to 4.3 megacuries. Approximately 90 percent of the deposition of debris now stored in the stratosphere will have occurred by 1970.
https://openalex.org/W2087665358,Diego blood factor is characteristic of Mongoloid populations. A study of 152 samples from Mexican Indians (Tlaxcaltecans) revealed this factor in 20.39 percent of the cases. Analysis of 30 Indian matings with 62 children support the hypothesis that the Diego antigen is transmitted through a gene capable of expressing itself in a single or double dose.
https://openalex.org/W2079714626,Customary methods of stimulating and recording were used to examine threshold shifts of the single visual receptor in the lateral eye of Limulus in response to low-level x-irradiation. Marked visual sensitization was found and was most pronounced at the lowest dosage levels (1 to 25 r). Complete light adaptation apparently cancelled the effects of the irradiation.
https://openalex.org/W1973255437,"A series of nuclear test explosions which occurred in the fall of 1958 caused a very large increase of Sr(89) and Ba(140) in the stratosphere. The Ba(140)/Sr(89) ratio in the stratosphere, and hence in the troposphere, has decreased steadily since then with a half-life of approximately 17 days."
https://openalex.org/W2010275720,"Direct electrical excitation of the intact medullary pyramids evokes a complex cortical response. When the pyramidal tract was dissected away from the bulb and stimulated in isolation, the antidromic cortical response consisted of a simple, positive potential, regardless of the stimulus parameters. This finding necessitates a reinterpretation of previous results obtained by stimulation of the intact pyramids."
https://openalex.org/W1973754267,"The sedimentation constant of an infectious component in ribonucleic acid preparations from foot-and-mouth disease virus has been determined by density-gradient centrifugation. A sedimentation constant of 37 Svedberg units (S(t)) was obtained. On the assumption that the relation between the molecular weight and the sedimentation constant found by Gierer is applicable to our system as well, a value of 3.1 x 10(6) was calculated for the molecular weight of the infectious component."
https://openalex.org/W2091631328,"Consideration was given to the possible use of individual growth curves to estimate ad libitum-feeding weights as part of technique for producing specified degrees of food deprivation. In heterozygous animals, this possibility was found to be feasible but limited by the occurrence of discontinuous growth functions."
https://openalex.org/W2034000292,"Four newly hatched larvae of the warble fly, Cuterebra angustifrons, were successfully introduced into the mouse host, Peromyscus leucopus, by application to the belly skin, the mouth, and the nose. Regardless of the site of entry, each larva migrated to the inguinal region of the host and completed its development normally."
https://openalex.org/W2026239460,"Accompanying the structural changes in medullary bone during the egg-laying cycle there are local increases in the concentration of soluble, citrate. Since citrate can form both soluble and insoluble compounds with calcium, it is suggested that this anion may have a regulatory function in bone apposition and resorption."
https://openalex.org/W1982281844,No teratoma formation and very little growth and differentiation followed implantation of late gastrula-stage frog embryos into forelimbs of adults. This is attributed to poor blood supply and rigid walls of muscle and bone surrounding the implants. The fate of embryos in nonamputated limbs is compared with that of regeneration-promoting implants in amputated limbs.
https://openalex.org/W2063213302,"Electron exchange involving the valence states of iron occurs via water bridges. Molecular oxygen reversibly displaces the sole coordinated water of the ferrous iron in hemoglobin, and, in the absence of this ready path for electron transfer, the oxygen is transported without oxidation of the ferrous iron of hemoglobin."
https://openalex.org/W2072509094,"Heterozygous mutations produced by 3000 r delay pupation in about 9 percent of larvae of Drosophila melanogaster under nutritional stress and kill approximately 6 percent. The effects are less, though appreciable, when there is excess nutrient; no effects are detectable after o√∂gonia are irradiated. Irradiated sperm and o√∂cytes cause detriment, partly via different types of mutations, in approximately equal amounts."
https://openalex.org/W2077396491,Increasing the pH from 3.0 to 10.8 increased the uterine weight three-fold and the number of positive vaginal smears from 0 to 78 percent in immature rats injected with chorionic gonadotropin in aqueous solution. Activity of a solution held at pH 2.6 and 5 degrees C for 24 hours was restored by neutralization.
https://openalex.org/W2012710920,"The spectra of reflectivities, refractive indices, and absorption indices of a bituminous coal vitrain have been determined for the ultraviolet-visible spectral region. The low values for these quantities support the premise that polynuclear condensed aromatics may be present in coal only in small amounts. Aliphatic and amorphous carbons may predominate. suggested for glass (6)."
https://openalex.org/W2021713180,"A hair growth around the nipples during lactation is described in two species of the Asiatic squirrel genus Callosciurus. The term lactation hair is coined for this phenomenon, which is shown to be different from mammary hair in the sense for which that term was coined."
