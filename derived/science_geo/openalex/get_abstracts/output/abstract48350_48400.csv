https://openalex.org/W1596038925,"Transcription from the major late promoter of adenovirus type 2 DNA (including DNA sequences from 56 nucleotides upstream to 33 nucleotides downstream of the CAP site) was reconstituted with transcription factors purified from HeLa cells. Five components, transcription factors (TF) IIA, -B, -E, -D and RNA polymerase II, were required for accurate initiation of transcription. Kinetic analyses combined with order of addition experiments suggested that TFIIA acted first during the initiation reaction and that this interaction was followed by the action of TFIID. In agreement with these conclusions, both TFIIA and TFIID were required to render a transcription reaction partially resistant to concentrations of Sarkosyl previously shown to inhibit an early step in the formation of a preinitiation complex. Related Sarkosyl studies indicated that the inferred complex was subsequently recognized by RNA polymerase II, which resulted in an increased level of Sarkosyl-resistant transcription (in the presence of TFIIA and TFIID), and that this interaction occurred independently of TFIIB and TFIIE. However, TFIIB and TFIIE were implicated, along with the other factors and RNA polymerase II, in the subsequent formation of a highly stable preinitiation complex, which was inferred from its ability to initiate (with added nucleotides) in the presence of heparin concentrations which blocked unbound factors. The identification of a new transcription factor, which was required only when viral sequences 3' to the major late promoter were part of the transcription unit, is also reported."

https://openalex.org/W1561398384,"The kinetics of the activation of human prothrombin catalyzed by human prothrombinase was studied using the fluorescent alpha-thrombin inhibitor dansylarginine-N-(3-ethyl-1,5-pentanediyl)amide (DAPA). Prothrombinase proteolytically activates prothrombin to alpha-thrombin by cleavages at Arg273-Thr274 (bond A) and Arg322-Ile323 (bond B). The differential fluorescence properties of DAPA complexed with the intermediates and products of human prothrombin activation were exploited to study the kinetics of the individual bond cleavages in the zymogen. When the catalyst was composed of prothrombinase (human factor Xa, human factor Va, synthetic phospholipid vesicles, and calcium ion), initial velocity studies of alpha-thrombin formation indicated that the kinetic constants for the cleavage of bonds A or B were similar to the constants that were obtained for the overall reaction (bonds A + B). The progress of the reaction was also monitored by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate. The results indicated that the activation of human prothrombin catalyzed by prothrombinase proceeded exclusively via the formation of meizothrombin (bond B-cleaved) as an intermediate. Kinetic studies of the cofactor dependence of the rates of cleavage of the individual bonds indicated that, in the absence of the cofactor, cleavage at bond B would constitute the rate-limiting step in prothrombin activation. Progress curves for prothrombin activation catalyzed by prothrombinase and monitored using the fluorophore DAPA were typified by the appearance of a transient maximum, indicating the formation of meizothrombin as an intermediate. When factor Xa alone was the catalyst, progress curves were characterized by an initial burst phase, suggesting the rapid production of prethrombin 2 (bond A-cleaved) followed by its slow conversion to alpha-thrombin. Gel electrophoresis followed by autoradiography was used to confirm these results. Collectively, the results indicate that the activation of human prothrombin via the formation of meizothrombin as an intermediate is a consequence of the association of the cofactor, human factor Va, with the enzyme, human factor Xa, on the phospholipid surface."
https://openalex.org/W1521619940,"Release of P-choline and choline from purified rat plasma membrane preparations was increased by GTP and its less hydrolyzable analogues, whereas other nucleotide triphosphates had little or no effect. Stimulation by guanosine 5'-(3-O-thiol)triphosphate (GTP gamma S) was dependent upon magnesium, inhibited by guanosine 5'-(2-O-thiol)diphosphate, and independent of calcium. ATP and ADP (1-100 microM) markedly enhanced the GTP gamma S stimulation of P-choline plus choline release but had no effect alone. ADP was as effective as ATP and nonhydrolyzable ATP analogues produced a similar or greater stimulation, whereas AMP and adenosine were much less effective. Vasopressin (0.1 microM) also produced a small stimulation. Under conditions in which protein kinase C was activated, PMA also stimulated the response to GTP gamma S but was ineffective in its absence. P-choline was the initial product which was hydrolyzed to choline. Guanine nucleotide and purinergic effects were also apparent on phosphatidylcholine degradation. EGTA, at 0.5 mM, completely removed purinergic stimulation but did not affect P-choline plus choline released in response to GTP gamma S alone. Prior treatment of plasma membranes with cholera toxin or prior injection of animals with islet-activating protein did not affect the stimulation of P-choline plus choline release either by GTP gamma S alone or by GTP gamma S plus ATP. These results indicate that a phosphatidylcholine phospholipase C is coupled to purinergic receptors in rat liver plasma membranes by a GTP-binding protein. Hydrolysis of phosphatidylcholine could contribute to hepatic diacylglycerol levels and thus influence protein kinase C activity."
https://openalex.org/W1559146544,"A Japanese subject with homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia was found to have a 7.8-kilobase deletion in the gene for the low density lipoprotein receptor. The deletion joins intron 15 to the middle of exon 18, which encodes the 3' untranslated region, thereby removing all 3' splice acceptor sites distal to intron 15. By S1 nuclease mapping, we demonstrated that the 5' splice donor site of intron 15 is no longer used. Instead a continuous transcript is produced in which exon 15 is followed by the remaining segments of intron 15 and exon 18. The translational reading frame of exon 15 continues for 165 nucleotides into intron 15 before a termination codon is reached. This mRNA should produce a truncated receptor that lacks the normal membrane-spanning region and cytoplasmic domain and that has 55 novel amino acids at its COOH terminus. A cDNA expression vector containing this sequence produced a receptor that behaved similarly to the truncated protein produced by the Japanese patient, i.e. greater than 90% of the receptor was secreted from the cell, and the receptors remaining on the surface showed defective internalization. The deletion in this subject resulted from a recombination between two repetitive sequences of the Alu family, one in intron 15 and the other in exon 18. To date, Alu sequences have been observed at the deletion joints of all four gross deletions in the low density lipoprotein receptor gene that have been characterized. Within these Alu sequences, six out of the seven breakpoints have occurred in the left arm. These data suggest that recombination between Alu sequences may be a frequent cause of deletions in the human genome."

https://openalex.org/W1606121585,"An enzyme has been found in Triton-treated rat liver Golgi membranes which trims Glc1Man9GlcNAc to Man8GlcNAc with the release of Glc alpha 1-3Man. By removing a glucosylmannose disaccharide and yielding only one Man8GlcNAc isomer, this endo-alpha-D-mannosidase provides a processing route alternative to the sequential actions of alpha-glucosidase II and alpha-mannosidase I. The endomannosidase was fully active in the presence of 1-deoxynojirimycin and EDTA which inhibited exoglycosidase release of glucose and mannose, respectively, and these agents were, therefore, included in the standard assay. The specific activity of the endomannosidase was found to be 69-fold greater in Golgi than in rough endoplasmic reticulum (RER) membranes, and Golgi-RER mixing experiments excluded the possibility that the low activity in the RER was the result of some inhibitor present in this fraction. The neutral pH optimum (approximately 7.0) of the enzyme was consistent with a role in N-linked oligosaccharide processing. The existence of an endo-alpha-D-mannosidase pathway for glucose removal could provide an explanation for the incomplete block in oligosaccharide processing which is observed in cells with inhibited or deficient alpha-glucosidase."
https://openalex.org/W1514850574,"A factor that stimulates random transcription of purified DNAs by RNA polymerase II has been partially purified and analyzed with respect to its possible role in specific transcription from class II promoters. Studies of the effect of this factor (transcription factor IIS) on transcription from the adenovirus major late promoter in a system reconstituted with RNA polymerase II and purified factors (IIA, IIB, IIE, and IID) indicated that it acted subsequent to the initiation step and that it stimulated the rate of elongation. Kinetic experiments indicated that the factor affected the efficiency with which the RNA polymerase II passed through pausing sites. The relationship of transcription factor IIS to a protein previously purified from Erlich ascites tumor cells (Sekimizu, K., Nakanishi, Y., Mizuno, D., and Natori, S. (1979) Biochemistry 18, 1582-1588) was also studied."
https://openalex.org/W2071317637,"The diversity of monomers available for synthesis of high polymers makes it possible to prepare a wide variety of long-chain macromolecular compounds. It is instructive to consider a hierarchical organization of structure in polymers at four successive levels--the molecular, nano-, micro-, and macrolevels--and to examine how interactions at and between these various levels of structure have important and often quite specific influences. Examples are drawn from semicrystalline polymers with flexible chains, liquid-crystalline polymers composed of rigid macromolecules, and amorphous polymers. Structural hierarchies in biocomposite systems are also discussed, particularly in soft connective tissues such as tendon and intervertebral disk."
https://openalex.org/W1668671560,"Abstract Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy has been used to study the secondary structure of the human erythrocyte glucose transporter after purification and reconstitution in erythrocyte lipids. The spectra indicate that the glucose transporter contains, in addition to the predominant alpha-helical structure, an appreciable amount of beta-structure and random coil conformation. A study of the time dependency of H-2H exchange revealed that more than 80% of the polypeptide backbone is readily accessible to the solvent. This result indicates that a portion of the intramembrane-spanning region of the membrane protein is exposed to the solvent, suggesting the existence of an intraprotein aqueous channel. The residual (10-20%) portion of the protein which exchanges slowly includes some alpha-helical structure, probably situated in a hydrophobic environment inside the membrane. The infrared spectra of transporter preparations were also examined after incubation with substrate and substrate analogues. Compared with the spectra recorded under conditions in which the inward-facing form predominates, a small but reproducible shift in the bands assigned to alpha-helical and beta-strand structures is observed after incubation with 4,6-O-ethylidene-D-glucose, which largely fixes the transporter in the conformation. An increase of temperature, which is known to increase the proportion of transporter in the outward-facing conformation, results in a similar shift in this alpha-helical absorption band."
https://openalex.org/W1486751963,"Lipoprotein synthesis by the colonic adenocarcinoma cell line Caco-2 was investigated to assess the utility of this cell line as a model for the in vitro study of human intestinal lipid metabolism. Electron micrographic analysis of conditioned medium revealed that under basal conditions of culture post-confluent Caco-2 cells synthesize and secrete lipoprotein particles. Lipoproteins of density (d) less than 1.063 g/ml consist of a heterogeneous population of particles (diameter from 10 to 90 nm). This fraction consists of very low density lipoproteins (d less than 1.006 g/ml) and low density lipoproteins (d = 1.019-1.063 g/ml). Analysis by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of [35S]methionine-labeled Caco-2 lipoproteins revealed that very low density lipoproteins contain apolipoprotein E (apoE) and C apolipoproteins, while low density lipoproteins contained apoB-100, apoE, apoA-I, and C apolipoproteins. The 1.063-1.21 g/ml density fraction contained two morphological entities, discoidal (diameter 15.6 +/- 3.9 nm) and round high density lipoprotein particles (diameter 10.2 +/- 2.3 nm). The high density lipoproteins contained apoA-I, apoB-100, apoB-48, apoE, and the C apolipoproteins. Using isoelectric focusing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis newly secreted apoA-I was identified as pro-apoA-I. ApoE and apoC-III released by Caco-2 cells were highly sialylated. mRNA species for apoA-I, apoC-III, and apoE, but not apoA-IV were identified by Northern blot analysis. ApoA-I, apoB, and apoE were visualized in Caco-2 cells by immunolocalization analysis. This intestinal cell line may be useful for in vitro studies of nutritional and hormonal regulation of lipoprotein synthesis."
https://openalex.org/W1586160554,"Drosophila Kc cells were utilized to prepare nuclear extracts in which promoter-containing DNA templates were efficiently transcribed by RNA polymerase II. A combination of fractionation schemes was used to identify and partially purify seven activities (factors) which affected the transcription of four different genes in vitro. Reconstructing specific transcription required exogenous RNA polymerase II in addition to these factors. Moreover, the high efficiency of transcription characteristic of the crude extract was preserved in reconstruction reactions. The methods used are presented in detail. Functions were assigned to several of the factors. One essential factor appeared to affect initiation and displayed chromatographic properties unlike any other Drosophila transcription factor previously described. Two factors specifically affected RNA chain elongation. Another activity was a DNase inhibitor required to preserve template integrity in the fractionated system. The remaining three factors were not absolutely essential but affected the specific in vitro transcription either qualitatively or quantitatively. A comparison of these transcription factors with other Drosophila and mammalian transcription factors is made."
https://openalex.org/W1594675904,"Chicken gizzard smooth muscle contains a highly abundant protein (SM22) with an apparent Mr on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide electrophoretic gels of 23,000. The ratio of actin:SM22:tropomyosin in this tissue is estimated to be 6.5(+/- 0.8):2.0(+/- 0.2):1.0. At least three isoelectric isoforms are present in ratios of alpha:beta:gamma of 14:5:1 with alpha the most basic and gamma the most acidic. A method for the purification of SM22 and partial separation of its isoforms is described. Amino acid analyses of purified alpha and beta demonstrate the presence of 1 and 2 half-cystines, respectively, and a lower content of basic amino acids in beta. A value of 22,000 for the Mr of alpha estimated by sedimentation equilibrium indicated its presence as a monomer at physiological ionic strengths. Estimates of the translational frictional coefficient (f/fmin) of alpha calculated from its Stokes radius (25.5 A) and Mr were consistent with its existence as a moderately asymmetric globular protein. Calculations based on its far-ultraviolet CD spectrum provided values of 37% alpha-helix, 31% beta-sheet, 5% beta-turn, and 27% random coil. SM22 was shown not to share functional properties with several proteins of similar Mr and isoelectric point such as myokinase, brain 23-kDa protein, and troponin I. We conclude that it is a novel protein not previously isolated or characterized from any tissue."
https://openalex.org/W1681073114,"The effects of phosphorylation of ribosomal protein S6 by two different protein kinases, the cAMP-dependent protein kinase and the mitogen-stimulated S6 kinase, or translation of globin mRNA in a reconstituted system and on binding of globin mRNA to 40 S ribosomal subunits were examined. The cAMP-dependent protein kinase incorporated 1.5 mol of phosphate/mol of 40 S ribosomal subunits. Phosphorylation of S6 by the cAMP-dependent protein kinase had no effect on binding of 3' terminus-labeled globin mRNA to 40 S ribosomal subunits. [3H]Leucine incorporation with 40 S ribosomal subunits phosphorylated by the cAMP-dependent protein kinase was identical to that observed with nonphosphorylated 40 S ribosomal subunits, although on occasion, a slight inhibition (less than 10%) was observed; there was no effect on the rate of synthesis of either the alpha or beta chains of globin. Phosphorylation with the mitogen-stimulated S6 kinase (2.5 mol/mol) did not alter binding of globin mRNA to 40 S ribosomal subunits; however, translation of globin mRNA in the reconstituted protein-synthesizing system was stimulated up to 4-fold over that observed with nonphosphorylated subunits. Synthesis of both the alpha and beta chains of globin was enhanced by phosphorylation as shown by electrophoretic analysis. Since the sites phosphorylated by the mitogen-stimulated S6 kinase are identical to those observed in vivo in response to insulin and growth-promoting compounds, the data support the hypothesis that enhanced synthesis of specific proteins may be due to phosphorylation of S6 and that differential phosphorylation of S6 can alter translation of natural mRNA."

https://openalex.org/W1489297072,"The hydrolysis of ATP that accompanies actin polymerization occurs on the F-actin subsequent to the elongation step. For Mg-actin, the rate of ATP hydrolysis is similar to the rate of elongation at low concentrations of G-actin but increases more slowly as the G-actin concentration is increased. This behavior can be quantitatively modeled by assuming that ATP hydrolysis occurs predominantly, but not exclusively, on a single subunit of Mg-F-actin at the interface between an ATP-subunit cap and an ADP-subunit core. The rates of elongation of Ca-actin and Mg-actin are similar but the rate of ATP hydrolysis on Ca-F-actin is appreciably slower than the rate of elongation at all concentrations of Ca-G-actin. The data for Ca-actin can be modeled by assuming that ATP hydrolysis occurs essentially randomly on Ca-F-actin within a large ATP cap which can be as long as 2,000 subunits in a 10,000-subunit long filament."

https://openalex.org/W1500154631,"The oligomeric state of the chicken hepatic receptor for N-acetylglucosamine-terminated glycoproteins (the chicken hepatic lectin) has been examined in detergent solution, in various membrane preparations, and in hepatocytes. In detergent solution, the cross-linking reagent, 1,5-difluoro-2,4-dinitrobenzene produces covalent complexes containing up to six receptor polypeptides. This result, along with hydrodynamic studies of the receptor-detergent complex, indicates that the purified receptor is a hexamer. Analysis of large proteolytic fragments of the receptor reveals that portions of the receptor polypeptide near the membrane anchor are essential for hexamer stability. This analysis also demonstrates that each receptor polypeptide has an N-acetylglucosamine-binding site, indicating that the native hexameric receptor contains a cluster of six such sites. Immunoblot analysis of membrane fractions and cells cross-linked with 1,5-difluoro-2,4-dinitrobenzene or dimethyl adipimidate reveals that the receptor is also oligomeric in intact cells and in subcellular fractions representing cell surface and internalized receptor. Although the pattern of cross-linking observed in membranes differs from that observed with purified receptor, experiments indicate that the differences may be explained by the presence of membrane components which compete with receptor for reaction with cross-linking reagent. The presence of a cluster of carbohydrate-binding sites in the hepatocyte membrane can account for the preferential endocytosis of multivalent glycoprotein ligands by hepatocytes."
https://openalex.org/W1566043215,"Carbon monoxide dehydrogenase from acetate-grown cells of Methanosarcina barkeri exists in a high molecular weight form (approximately 3 × 10(6)) under conditions of high ionic strength but is converted to a much smaller form by dialysis. The enzyme was purified by a procedure which exploits isolation of the aggregated form by gel filtration and subsequent dissociation. Following this, the enzyme was purified to within 92% of homogeneity by chromatography on phenyl-Sepharose and finally on hydroxylapatite. Due to the extreme oxygen lability of the enzyme, the entire procedure was carried out within the anaerobic laboratory at the National Institutes of Health. The enzyme has an alpha 2 beta 2 oligomeric structure composed of subunits with molecular weights of 19,700 and 84,500. The amino acid compositions of the individual subunits were determined. Analysis of the metal content by plasma emission spectroscopy indicated 1.3 +/- 0.3 (n = 4) nickel and 15.6 +/- 5.6 (n = 5) iron per mol of alpha 2 beta 2. The enzyme did not contain significant amounts of cobalt or molybdenum. Ferredoxin, FAD, FMN, 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride, methyl viologen, and phenazine methosulfate served as electron acceptors; however, the enzyme failed to reduce NAD+, NADP+, or the 8-hydroxy-5-deazaflavin factor F420. The optimum pH was between 7 and 9. The apparent Km for methyl viologen was 7.1 mM, whereas the value for 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride was below 0.5 mM. Strong inhibition was observed by oxygen and cyanide. Inactivation by glyoxaldehyde required enzymatic turnover which suggested that a reactive group was formed, or exposed, on an enzyme intermediate in catalysis. A high degree of thermostability was noted. Carbon monoxide, however, rendered the enzyme more susceptible to temperature inactivation."
https://openalex.org/W1515622885,"Data from the literature indicate the presence, in the Mycobacterium kansasii wall, of a phenolic glycolipid called mycoside A. A tentative trisaccharide structure was proposed for the oligosaccharide part, whereas the aglycone was found to correspond to a phenol phthiocerol residue esterified by two mycocerosic acids. In the present work, structural information mainly arising from fast atom bombardment-mass spectrometry, tandem mass spectrometry, and 1H NMR of native and chemically degraded phenolic glycolipid indicates a tetrasaccharide structure for the inherent oligosaccharide. This structure is now determined as: 2,6-dideoxy-4-O-methyl-arabino-hexopyranosyl(1 alpha----3)2-O-methyl-4-O- acetylfucopyranosyl(1 alpha----3)2-O-methyl-rhamnopyranosyl(1 alpha----3)2-4-di- O-methylrhamnopyranosyl-1 alpha----phenolglycol. Evidence for the structure of the dideoxyhexose, unique in mycobacteria, is presented in the following paper (Fournie, J.-J., Riviere, M., Papa, F., and Puzo, G. (1987) J. Biol. Chem. 262, 3180-3184)."
https://openalex.org/W1489215928,"Protein kinase C (Ca2+/phospholipid-dependent protein kinase) purified from rat brain or endogenous to cell-free extracts from HeLa cells stimulates, by a factor of 2-3, HeLa DNA polymerase alpha but not beta or gamma. Monoclonal antibody to the kinase prevents the stimulation, and monoclonal antibody to human DNA polymerase alpha neutralizes the enhanced activity. Reduced DNA polymerase alpha activity is obtained from noncycling HeLa cells and this activity has lower fidelity when copying synthetic primer-templates than that obtained from log phase cultures. After exposure to the kinase, the fidelities and activities of the polymerase from both sources increase by 2- to 3-fold. This improved accuracy is not accompanied by the appearance of triphosphatase or DNase activities. Exposure to the protein kinase reduces the Km for activated DNA and for poly(dA-dT) but not for dNTPs. Moreover, the Vmax for activated DNA but not for poly(dA-dT) is increased approximately 2- to 3-fold. These alterations suggest a role for protein phosphorylation in modulating DNA polymerase alpha."
https://openalex.org/W1520846637,"Megakaryocyte stimulatory factor (MSF) has been purified to homogeneity (7.5 X 10(5)-fold) from serum-free conditioned medium obtained from cultured human embryonic kidney cells and to near homogeneity (1.44 X 10(7)-fold) from thrombocytopenic rabbit plasma. MSF activity from either source was assayed by its ability to enhance the rate of synthesis of platelet factor 4-like proteins in a rat promegakaryoblast cell line. The 125I-labeled factor prepared from human embryonic kidney cell conditioned medium is homogeneous as judged by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and isoelectric focusing in the presence of 9.2 M urea. MSF obtained from the above source is an acidic protein (pI = 5.1) with an Mr = 15,000 which stimulates platelet factor 4-like protein synthesis in rat promegakaryoblast cells by as much as 7-fold, and exhibits half-maximal activity at a concentration of 0.8 pM. MSF was also purified from thrombocytopenic rabbit plasma by a nearly identical isolation procedure, and 125I-labeled factor prepared from this source also possessed an Mr = 15,000. MSF exhibited no biologic activity corresponding to other known hemopoietic growth factors, and appears to be specific for the megakaryocyte lineage."
https://openalex.org/W1575208435,"S100 protein is a calcium-binding protein found in vertebrate nervous tissue. Synthesis of S100 protein in the rat glioma cell line, C6, is inhibited by the addition of anti-microtubular drugs. We have cloned a cDNA for the beta subunit of S100 protein from rat brain in a lambda gt 11 expression vector and used this cDNA to measure the amounts of S100 beta subunit mRNA in C6 cells after treatment with anti-microtubular drugs. Levels of alpha-tubulin and beta-actin mRNAs were also measured. All measurements were performed using RNA-RNA hybridization techniques at high stringency with rat mRNA-specific probes. After 24 h of treatment, the S100 beta subunit mRNA was reduced to levels of 25% by colchicine and 32% by vinblastine when compared to untreated controls. In contrast, the levels of tubulin and actin mRNAs were only slightly changed by these treatments. These studies demonstrate that disruption of the microtubular cytoskeleton causes a specific reduction in the level of S100 protein mRNA in C6 cells."
https://openalex.org/W1561012029,"Previously, we had described the structures of the haptenic oligosaccharides of the surface glycopeptidolipid antigens from serotypes 9 and 25 of the Mycobacterium avium complex and had synthesized these units as putative antigenic probes. The lack of chemical concordance between the synthetic products and the haptens has prompted a re-examination of these structures utilizing the instrumental techniques not previously available of fast atom bombardment-mass spectrometry, Fourier transform infra-red, and high resolution NMR spectroscopy. With the additional information thus available, more extensive chemical fragmentations by base degradation, followed by alkylation, have furnished supportive evidence to allow formulation of revised and novel structures, all of which contain glucuronic acid: serotype 9, 2,3-di-O-Me-L-Fucp(alpha 1—4)-D-GlcAp(beta 1—4)-2,3-di-O-Me-L-Fucp(alpha 1—3)-L-Rhap(alpha 1—2)-6dTal; and serotype 25, 4-acetamido-4,6-dideoxy-2-O-Me-hexosyl(alpha 1—4)-D- GlcAp(beta 1—4)2-O-Me-L-Fucp(alpha 1—3)-L-Rhap(alpha 1—2)6dTal. Glucuronic acid, acetamido sugars, and other novel sugars appear to be widespread in the glycopeptidolipid antigens of Mycobacterium spp. The revised structures will allow renewed synthesis of artificial antigen probes and rational approaches to preparing monoclonal antibodies, both necessary for the new diagnostics required to trace the sources of widespread infections due to M. avium and Mycobacterium intracellulare."
https://openalex.org/W1563068859,"A novel O-methyl-2,6-dideoxyhexose was isolated from the major phenolic glycolipid (previously called mycoside A) of Mycobacterium kansasii. Its molecular weight (162) was determined by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis (chemical ionization with ammonia as reactant gas) of its underivatized reducing form. The methoxyl group was located by electron impact-mass spectrometry of its alditol acetate. The configuration was established by 1H NMR of its peracetylated derivative. The structure 2,6-dideoxy-4-O-methyl-arabino-hexopyranose is proposed for this new sugar. Evidence is also presented that the phenolic glycolipid previously called mycoside A is an antigen of M. kansasii since it reacts with rabbit antisera raised against whole M. kansasii."
https://openalex.org/W1640208288,"Abstract A cellular binding protein for 3,3',5-triiodo-L-thyronine (T3) was solubilized with 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl) dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonate (CHAPS) from A431 human epidermoid carcinoma cells. The binding activity is T3 specific. Analysis of the equilibrium binding data indicated that the binding protein has one class of binding sites for T3 with a Kd of (17 +/- 3) nM and Bmax of (1.8 +/- 0.6) pmol/50 micrograms of protein. The pH optimum for binding is 6.8. The T3 binding protein elutes from Sephadex G-200 in an included peak which has a Stokes radius of 40 A and sediments on glycerol gradients at 3.7 S. By affinity labeling with [3,5-125I]thyroxine a protein with a molecular weight of 58,000 was specifically labeled. Its isoelectric point was determined to be 7.1, which is different from the reported pIs of other thyroid hormone binding proteins. p58 was successively purified to apparent homogeneity by chromatography on Sephadex G-200, QAE-Sephadex, SP-Sephadex, and hydroxylapatite. Approximately 50 micrograms of purified protein was obtained from 2.5 X 10(9) cells with a yield of 1.1%. The purified protein retains its binding activity. The specific binding activity is enriched by approximately 1000-fold. With the availability of a purified protein with T3 binding activity, it becomes possible to study its cellular function."

https://openalex.org/W1562721449,"A heat stable microtubule-associated protein of Mr 190,000 (190-kDa MAP) has been purified from bovine adrenal cortex (Murofushi, H., Kotani, S., Aizawa, H., Hisanaga, S., Hirokawa, N., and Sakai, H. (1986) J. Cell Biol. 103, 1911-1919). Limited chymotryptic digestion of 190-kDa MAP produced a fragment of Mr 27,000 (27-kDa fragment), which bound to microtubules reconstituted in the presence of taxol. This fragment was purified with the aid of cosedimentation with microtubules. The purified 27-kDa fragment showed an ability to stimulate tubulin polymerization in the absence of taxol. Electron microscopic observation of microtubules reconstituted from purified 27-kDa fragment and tubulin revealed that the microtubules were in the form of thick bundles and that lateral projections which can be seen in microtubules reconstituted from intact 190-kDa MAP and tubulin were not observed. These results indicate that 27-kDa fragment includes or is a part of microtubule-binding domain of 190-kDa MAP and that this fragment is active in stimulating microtubule assembly. Amino acid analysis revealed that the 27-kDa fragment was rich in lysine, proline, and alanine, the sum of these three being about 45% of the total amino acids and that the contents of methionine, tyrosine, phenylalanine, and histidine were very low. These data suggest that the microtubule binding domain of the 190-kDa MAP comprises an unique structure."
https://openalex.org/W1486430121,"Rats were injected with 35SO4 and after 2 h their livers were removed and used to prepare a detergent-insoluble cytoskeleton fraction. Spectrin, cytokeratins, and actin were major protein components of the isolated cytoskeletons. The cytoskeleton fraction accounted for approximately 14% of the total trichloroacetic acid-insoluble 35SO4 radioactivity incorporated into the liver. The cytoskeleton-associated radioactivity was present in a single species of macromolecule. This molecule was not present to a significant extent in the detergent-soluble fraction containing the cell supernatant and dissolved membrane proteins. Further characterization revealed the cytoskeleton-associated molecule was a heparan sulfate proteoglycan: it was eluted from a Sepharose CL-4B column under denaturing conditions at Kav = 0.4; following mild alkaline hydrolysis the radioactivity was eluted at a Kav = 0.7; when this material was subjected to nitrous acid hydrolysis all of the radioactivity was eluted near the column included volume. The isolated cytoskeletons contained attached nuclei. Pure nuclei isolated without associated cytoskeletal elements contained less than 1% of the total liver trichloroacetic acid-insoluble 35SO4 radioactivity and no detectable heparan sulfate proteoglycan. These results suggested that other matrix proteins might be associated with the liver cytoskeleton. When the subcellular distribution of laminin was monitored by immunostaining proteins transferred to nitrocellulose, laminin was detected exclusively in the cytoskeleton fraction. These results provide evidence for an association between extracellular connective tissue proteins and intracellular structural proteins."
https://openalex.org/W1533520495,"Two general kinds of exocytotic secretion of proteins are known: that which is stimulated by secretagogues; and constitutive exocytosis, which is unable to be stimulated. The exocrine pancreas has often been cited as a model system for the first kind of secretion. However, the release of digestive enzymes from the exocrine pancreas of 1-day prenatal rats cannot be stimulated by secretagogues; therefore, its secretion is constitutive. To gain insight into the intracellular pathways which mediate secretion in the fetal gland, we examined the kinetics of release of newly synthesized proteins. We find that fetal pancreas in a steady state of secretion releases pulse-labeled secretory proteins in two kinetically distinct phases. The first phase occurring during 0-6.5 h of chase comprises approximately 12% of total incorporated radioactivity, the second phase beginning at greater than 7 h of chase comprises the remainder. Based on analysis by electron microscope autoradiography, radiolabel is localized during the first phase of secretion in immature granules/condensing vacuoles, Golgi compartments, and few mature granules. The second phase of secretion occurs when radiolabel is predominantly in mature granules. We propose that secretion occurs via (at least) 2 exocytotic routes, both of which are constitutive in fetal pancreatic tissue."
https://openalex.org/W2073111213,"Water reabsorption across many ""tight"" urinary epithelia is driven by large transepithelial osmotic gradients and is controlled by antidiuretic hormone (ADH). Numerous investigators have concluded that ADH-induced water reabsorption causes large apparent increases in cell volume with concomitant cytoplasmic dilution. A central question in renal physiology has been how cellular homeostasis is maintained in tight urinary epithelia during antidiuresis. Previous direct measurements of cell membrane permeability to water and the present direct measurements of cell volume in collecting tubules of rabbit kidney cortex by quantitative light microscopy show that cell volume does not change significantly during transcellular water flow. Fluid transported across the epithelium accumulated in lateral and basal intercellular spaces; the effect was an increase in cell height and tubule wall thickness accompanied by maintenance of nearly constant cell volume. The stability of cell volume is a consequence of the relatively high water permeability of the blood-facing cell membrane."
https://openalex.org/W1482454681,"Elementary reactions have been studied quantitatively in the complex overall process catalyzed by horseradish peroxidase whereby isobutyraldehyde and molecular oxygen react to form triplet state acetone and formic acid. The rate constant for the reaction of the enol form of isobutyraldehyde with compound I of peroxidase is (8 +/- 1) X 10(6) M-1 s-1 and with compound II (1.3 +/- 0.3) X 10(6) M-1 s-1. Neither the enolate anion nor the keto form is reactive. The reactivity of enols with peroxidase parallels that of unionized phenols and a common mechanism is proposed. The overall catalyzed reaction of isobutyraldehyde and oxygen consists of an initial burst followed by a steady state phase. The burst is caused by the following sequence: 1) an initial high yield of compound I is formed from reaction of native enzyme with the autoxidation product of isobutyraldehyde, a peracid and 2) compound I rapidly depletes the equilibrium pool of enol which is present. After this burst a steady state phase is observed in which the rate-limiting step is the conversion of the keto to the enol form of the aldehyde catalyzed by phosphate buffer. The rate constant for the keto form reacting with phosphate is (8.7 +/- 0.6) X 10(-5) M-1 s-1. All constants were measured in dilute aqueous ethanol at 35 degrees C, pH 7.4, and ionic strength 0.67 M. Both the initial burst of light and the steady state emission from triplet acetone can be observed with the naked eye. Since the magnitude of the burst is a measure of the equilibrium amount of enol, the keto-enol equilibrium constant is readily calculated and hence also the rate constant for conversion of enol to keto. The keto-enol equilibrium constant is unaffected by phosphate which therefore acts as a true catalyst."
https://openalex.org/W1647863670,"The establishment of the asymmetric distribution of proteins among the apical, basal, and internal plasma membrane (PM) domains was studied in HeLa cells. Comparisons were made of the amount of membrane and the redistribution of individual PM proteins in the three PM domains for cells on substrates that either induced cell attachment and spreading (gelatin), or induced only attachment (bovine serum albumin (BSA]. Many PM proteins were asymmetrically segregated among the apical, basal, and internal PM domains when cells were attached to gelatin. However, most of the proteins were not totally excluded from any of the domains. In contrast, there was no segregation of membrane components in cells attached to BSA. The segregation of most proteins was well established within 7.5 min of cell attachment when the cells were only partially spread. Cell adhesion induced a change in the movement of total membrane between the internal PM and the external PM domains. When cells attached to either gelatin or BSA there was a transient decrease in the internal PM pool that lasted less than 20 min. For cells attached to BSA the transient decrease was followed by the re-establishment of the internal PM pool which was equivalent to that found in cells in suspension, whereas in cells spreading on gelatin there was only a partial re-establishment of the internal PM pool. Taken together, these observations suggest that the internal PM rapidly moved to the external PM domain during cell adhesion, and that particular PM proteins moved from the internal PM pool into the newly established basal and apical PM domains."
https://openalex.org/W2159579011,"Melittin is a 26-amino acid amphipathic peptide which binds to calmodulin in a calcium-dependent manner. The utility of melittin as a peptide replica of the calmodulin-binding region of calmodulin acceptor proteins (CaMBPs) was investigated. Antibody against melittin was raised and purified by antigen affinity chromatography. Interaction of the antibody with CaMBPs was initially suggested by the ability of anti-melittin-Sepharose, but not nonimmune IgG-Sepharose, to bind calmodulin-dependent cyclic AMP phosphodiesterase. Direct interaction of melittin antibody with the calmodulin-binding domain of acceptor proteins was demonstrated by quantitative inhibition of calmodulin binding to the purified CaMBPs, myosin light chain kinase, and eel electric organ CaMBP55. These results indicate that melittin antibody identifies regions of structural similarity between calmodulin acceptor proteins, and this region includes a common calmodulin-binding domain."
https://openalex.org/W1565439953,"The structures of the major sialylated oligosaccharide chains in swine tracheal mucin glycoprotein were established. The oligosaccharide chains were released by treatment with alkaline borohydride and isolated by gel filtration on Bio-Gel P6 columns and chromatography on DEAE-cellulose. The neutral oligosaccharide chains in this glycoprotein have been characterized in previous studies (Rana, S.S., Chandrasekaran, E.V., Kennedy, J., and Mendicino, J. (1984) J. Biol. Chem. 259, 12899-12907; Chandrasekaran, E.V., Rana, S.S., Davila, M., and Mendicino, J. (1984) J. Biol. Chem. 259, 12908-12914). The present study reports the isolation of four monosialylated chains ranging in length from 6 to 14 sugar units, two disialylated chains containing 6 and 12 sugar units, and one trisialylated chain containing 9 sugar units. The structure of the sialylated oligosaccharides was determined by permethylation analysis and sequential hydrolysis with specific exoglycosidases. The following structures (where GalNAcol is N-acetylgalactosaminitol) were assigned to these oligosaccharides."
https://openalex.org/W1855593,"We describe a specific fibrinogen-hepatocyte interaction. Rabbit 125I-labeled fibrinogen (125I-FGN) was incubated at 4 degrees C with suspensions of rabbit hepatocytes (approximately 1 × 10(6) cells/ml). Bound ligand was separated from free by centrifugation of cells through oil and quantitated by gamma-scintillation counting. Specific binding, determined by subtraction of nonspecific binding in the presence of 8 mM EDTA from total binding in the presence of 2 mM CaCl2, required 3 h to plateau and represented approximately 70% of total binding. Specific binding was calcium-dependent and was negligible in buffer containing 2 mM MgCl2. Half-maximal saturation occurred at approximately 30 nM 125I-FGN with approximately 480,000 molecules/cell at saturation. Dilution experiments revealed comparable affinities for labeled and unlabeled fibrinogen. Total binding was irreversible as determined by addition of excess unlabeled fibrinogen or EDTA. Specific binding of 25 nM 125I-FGN was inhibited, in a concentration-dependent fashion, by unlabeled fibrinogen or fibrinogen fragment D95 (Mr = 95,000), but not by fibrinogen fragment E or Arg-Gly-Asp-containing peptides. Unlabeled fibrinogen (3.1 microM) completely abolished specific binding, whereas greater than 80% inhibition was achieved with 10 microM fragment D95. Sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and autoradiography of 125I-FGN bound in the presence of calcium demonstrated disappearance of A alpha chains with formation of products of Mr greater than 200,000; EDTA or unlabeled fibrinogen prevented fibrinogen processing. These data describe a unique fibrinogen-hepatocyte interaction which differs considerably from the platelet-fibrinogen interaction, especially with regard to the processing of the fibrinogen molecule."
https://openalex.org/W145083779,"Pantothenic acid transport was studied in the isolated perfused rat heart and isolated sheep cardiac sarcolemmal vesicles. In the perfused heart, pantothenic acid transport was significantly greater if hearts were perfused as working hearts rather than Langendorff hearts, but was unaffected by the perfusion substrates used (11 mM glucose or 1.2 mM palmitate). Uptake rates of pantothenic acid in working hearts are dependent on perfusate concentrations of pantothenic acid (a Vmax of 418 nmol/g dry weight/30 min and a Km for pantothenic acid of 10.7 mircoM were obtained). Reduction in perfusate Na+ concentration from 145 to 105 mM (the Na+ was replaced with 40 mM choline) resulted in a small but significant decrease in pantothenic acid uptake. At 145 mM Na+, addition of a mixture of amino acids, whose uptake is Na+-dependent, resulted in a significant decrease in pantothenic acid uptake by the heart (173 +/- 5 to 132 +/- 12 nmol/g dry weight). If an inward Na+ gradient in isolated, purified sarcolemmal vesicles, was imposed, a rapid uptake of pantothenic acid was observed. Uptake rates are markedly reduced if Na+ was replaced by equimolar concentrations of K+ or if external Na+ was reduced below 40 mM. In the presence of Na+, increasing pantothenic acid concentrations resulted in an increase in pantothenic acid uptake by the vesicles. Combined, these data demonstrate that pantothenic acid is transported across the myocardial sarcolemmal membrane by a Na+-dependent mechanism, which may be common to a number of small molecules."
https://openalex.org/W1547436608,"Abstract A soluble lectin, the core-specific lectin (CSL), is synthesized and secreted by rat hepatocytes and the rat hepatoma cell line, H-4-II-E. This lectin binds mannose and N-acetylglucosamine residues in the core region of Asn-linked oligosaccharides. Secretion of the CSL was found to occur over an extended period of time, greater than 4 h being required for secretion of 50% of the lectin (Brownell, M. D., Colley, K. J., and Baenziger, J. U. (1984) J. Biol. Chem. 259, 3925-3932). We have determined that following synthesis in the endoplasmic reticulum, the CSL is rapidly transported to the Golgi where it is retained for an extended period of time prior to secretion. The lectin undergoes two post-translational modifications within the Golgi: an increase from Mr 24,000 to 25,000 and a progressive decrease in pI with an accompanying increase in Mr to a final value of 26,000. The lectin is also assembled into high molecular weight complexes of 150-260 X 10(3) and acquires the ability to bind carbohydrate in the Golgi. In hepatoma cells, the 24,000-25,000 modification is completed 20 min after initiation of synthesis. Assembly of the CSL subunits into high molecular weight complexes, acquisition of carbohydrate binding activity, and the 25,000-26,000 modification occur between 20 and 80 min after initiation of synthesis. These events have slower kinetics in primary hepatocytes and this allowed us to determine that the sequence of these biosynthetic events is: the 24,000-25,000 modification, complex assembly, the 25,000-26,000 modification, and acquisition of carbohydrate binding activity. The 24,000-25,000 modification occurs prior to complex assembly. Complex assembly may occur prior to, or concomitant with, the 25,000-26,000 modification. Assembly into the oligomeric form and the 25,000-26,000 modification correlate with the attainment of carbohydrate binding activity. The kinetics of CSL modification and assembly cannot account for its retention within the Golgi. Interaction with Golgi components either through carbohydrate binding or another interaction, may act to selectively retain the lectin within the Golgi."
https://openalex.org/W1482819655,"Maltosylisothiocyanate (MITC), synthesized as an affinity label for the hexose carrier, has been reported to label a Band 3 or Mr = 100,000 protein in human erythrocytes, in contradistinction to many studies showing the carrier as a Band 4.5 or Mr = 45,000-66,000 protein on gel electrophoresis. In this work the possibility that MITC interacts with the Band 3 anion transporter was studied. In intact human erythrocytes, MITC labeling was largely confined to Band 3 and was decreased by several competitive inhibitors of hexose transport. However, MITC also appeared to react with the anion transport protein, since MITC labeling of Band 3 was irreversibly decreased by the anion transport inhibitor 4,4'-diisothiocyanostilbene-2,2'-disulfonate (DIDS) and since MITC also irreversibly inhibited both tritiated dihydro-DIDS labeling of Band 3 and sulfate uptake in intact cells. Although 20 microM DIDS had little effect on hexose transport, the labeling of erythrocyte Band 3 by the dihydro analog was significantly diminished by competitive inhibitors of hexose transport. These data suggest that MITC labels in part the anion transporter as well as other DIDS-reactive sites on Band 3 which appear to be sensitive to competitive inhibitors of hexose transport."
https://openalex.org/W1545428541,"An antiserum to a synthetic peptide corresponding to residues 95-117 of bovine proenkephalin recognizes all the major intermediates of this prohormone in bovine adrenal medulla (Birch, N. P. and Christie, D. L. (1986) J. Biol. Chem. 261, 12213-12221). This antiserum enabled an investigation of the stability and molecular properties of intermediates in the processing of proenkephalin in bovine adrenal medullary chromaffin granules. Intact and hypotonic lysates of chromaffin granules were incubated at 37 degrees C and the stability of intermediates assessed by gel filtration followed by radioimmunoassay and gel electrophoresis in combination with immunoblotting. Processing was slow in intact granules compared with incubations of hypotonic lysates which resulted in the selective cleavage of an Mr 27,000 intermediate and increases in the amounts of immunoreactivity of lower molecular weight. Protease inhibitors increased the stability of the 27-kilodalton intermediate, the most effective being p-chloromercuribenzoate. Preliminary evidence was obtained for the regulation of the processing of this intermediate by soluble factors present in chromaffin granules. It appears that membrane-associated intermediates of proenkephalin are relatively stable, although analysis of soluble immunoreactivity released during the incubation of chromaffin granule membranes showed a decrease in the 27-kilodalton intermediate and increased amounts of lower molecular weight intermediates. Analysis of hypotonic lysates by two-dimensional gel-electrophoresis showed that proenkephalin intermediates exhibit significant microheterogeneity. It will be important to compare the products of proenkephalin generated by purified proteases with a putative role in the processing of this prohormone with the properties of endogenous intermediates as revealed in this study."
https://openalex.org/W1572117593,"When rabbit muscle phosphorylase reconstituted with pyridoxal (5')-diphospho(1)-alpha-D-glucose is incubated with glycogen, its glucosyl moiety is transferred to the nonreducing end of glycogen with the formation of a new alpha-1,4-glucosidic linkage. This finding provided the first evidence for the direct phosphate-phosphate interaction between the coenzyme pyridoxal 5'-phosphate and the substrate alpha-D-glucose 1-phosphate in the phosphorylase catalytic reaction (Takagi, M., Fukui, T., and Shimomura, S. (1982) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 79, 3716-3719). We have examined whether pyridoxal(5')triphospho(1)-alpha-D-glucose can act in a similar manner to the diphospho compound or not. In the absence of glucan the enzyme-bound triphospho compound was stable for 1 day at pH 6-9. In the presence of glucan, however, its glucosidic linkage was cleaved, and the glucosyl moiety liberated was transferred to glycogen with the formation of a new alpha-1,4-glucosidic linkage. Allosteric activator AMP accelerated the reaction and allosteric inhibitor glucose 6-phosphate showed the reverse effect. The pH optimum of the reaction was pH 8.1-8.4. Mg2+ slightly but significantly accelerated the reaction, whereas Mn2+ and Ca2+ inhibited the reaction. These results indicate that the glucosyltransfer from the triphospho compound occurs in an identical manner to that from the diphospho compound. Based on the present and previous data, we discuss the catalytic mechanism of phosphorylase, especially in comparison with that of phosphoryltransferases."
https://openalex.org/W1597304641,"A protein which cross-links actin filaments in a nucleotide-sensitive manner has been purified to homogeneity from Acanthamoeba castellanii. This protein, GF-210, is a slightly asymmetric molecule composed of six subunits, each with an apparent mass of 35,000 Da. As determined by the method of falling ball vicometry, GF-210 was shown to cross-link actin filaments at hexamer:actin molar ratios of 1:500, with gelation occurring at molar ratios of 1:300 and higher. Actin gels did not form in the presence of 10 microM ATP, and filament cross-linking was completely inhibited by 100 microM ATP. Although ATP was the most effective inhibitor of actin filament cross-linking, other phospho-compounds including ADP, GTP, sodium phosphate, and sodium pyrophosphate prevented gelation at concentrations lower than 1.5 mM. In contrast, 50 mM KCl was required to inhibit the formation of actin networks. Direct binding studies showed that GF-210 binds to F-actin with a KD of 1.2 microM in the absence of ATP but with a KD of 72.8 microM in the presence of 2 mM ATP. This weakening of the interaction between F-actin and GF-210 may explain the inhibition of GF-210-induced actin cross-linking by nucleotides and other phospho-compounds."
