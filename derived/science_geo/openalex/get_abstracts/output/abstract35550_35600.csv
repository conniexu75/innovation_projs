https://openalex.org/W1599952788,"A cDNA encoding the growth hormone (GH) receptor was cloned from rat liver. Both the nucleotide and translated amino acid sequence share greater than 70% similarity with the GH receptors from rabbit and human. An RNA probe was generated from this sequence for use in a solution hybridization assay to quantitate GH receptor mRNA expression in rat tissues. Expression was detected in 9/12 tissues examined, with the highest levels observed in the liver. Expression in liver, kidney, heart and muscle was developmentally regulated, being low at birth and rising to adult levels in 5 weeks. No difference was observed between hepatic expression in males and females, although livers from pregnant rats had elevated levels. Hypophysectomy and GH treatment did not affect hepatic GH receptor mRNA levels."
https://openalex.org/W1583601846,"Abstract A new enzyme, NG, NG-dimethylarginine dimethylaminohydrolase which plays a role in the metabolism of NG,NG-dimethyl-L-arginine, has been purified to homogeneity from rat kidney. The enzyme consists of a single polypeptide and its molecular weight is about 33,000. The isoelectric point of the enzyme is at pH 5.2. The enzyme catalyzes the hydrolytic liberation of the dimethylamino moiety of NG,NG-dimethyl-L-arginine and forms L-citrulline and dimethylamine. It is highly specific for NG,NG-dimethyl-L-arginine and NG-monomethyl-L-arginine, and the Km values for these amino acids are 0.18 and 0.36 mM, respectively. The enzyme shows the maximum activity at pH 6.5 and requires no cofactor. The activity is strongly inhibited by SH-blocking reagents (e.g. p-chloromercuribenzoate and HgCl2) and divalent metal ions (e.g. Cd2+, Cu2+, and Zn2+)."
https://openalex.org/W1499024571,"A murine mRNA (provisionally called 2ar) is described whose abundance is greatly increased by the tumor promoter 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate both in JB6 epidermal cells in vitro and in epidermis in vivo. We have previously shown induction of 2ar in epidermal or fibroblast cell lines by tumor promoters, growth factors, and transformation with H-ras. The 2ar mRNA appears to be derived from a single copy gene. It encodes the mouse homolog of rat osteopontin, a 41.5-kDa glycosylated bone phosphoprotein that binds to fibroblasts and osteosarcoma cells and to hydroxylapatite (bone matrix). The rat and mouse sequences are 84% identical at the amino acid level and 87% identical at the nucleotide level. Many of the primary structural features are conserved, including a run of 9-10 aspartic residues and a Gly-Arg-Gly-Asp-Ser cell adhesion sequence. Antiserum raised against portions of the predicted polypeptide immunoprecipitated proteins of apparent Mr 55,000-70,000 both from reticulocyte lysates containing the translation products of hybrid-selected mRNA and from cell culture medium containing metabolically labeled proteins by JB6 cells. The results presented here demonstrate that osteopontin is identical to a transformation-associated phosphoprotein whose level of expression by cultured cells and abundance in human sera has been correlated with tumorigenicity. These results suggest a role for osteopontin in carcinogenesis. The murine version of osteopontin has been given the formal name secreted phosphoprotein 1 and the designation spp."
https://openalex.org/W1622047218,"The bactericidal permeability increasing protein (BPI) is a 50-60-kDa membrane-associated protein isolated from granules of polymorphonuclear leukocytes. A full-length cDNA clone encoding human BPI has been isolated and the derived amino acid sequence reveals a structure that is consistent with previously determined biological properties. BPI may be organized into two domains: the amino-terminal half, previously shown to contain all known antimicrobial activity, contains a large fraction of basic and hydrophilic residues. In contrast, the carboxyl-terminal half contains more acidic than basic residues and includes several potential transmembrane regions which may anchor the holoprotein in the granule membrane. The cytotoxic action of BPI is limited to many species of Gram-negative bacteria; this specificity may be explained by a strong affinity of the very basic aminoterminal half for the negatively charged lipopolysaccharides that are unique to the Gram-negative bacterial envelope. The amino-terminal end of BPI exhibits significant similarity with the sequence of a rabbit lipopolysaccharide-binding protein, suggesting that both molecules share a similar structure for binding lipopolysaccharides."
https://openalex.org/W1496112877,"Transcripts initiated in the region immediately upstream from the human dihydrofolate reductase gene but transcribed from the opposite strand have been identified in human cells. These divergent upstream transcripts are polyadenylated, start at 89 base pairs upstream from the dihydrofolate reductase major initiation site, and are composed of two species of 5.0 and 3.8 kilobases in length. We have isolated complementary DNA clones derived from the divergent transcripts and identified a 3.5-kilobase open reading frame in one of these clones. Computer-assisted sequence analyses have shown that there is no significant sequence homology between the putative amino acid sequence and known protein sequences. This arrangement of two divergent transcriptional units suggests that the expression of these two genes may be regulated by a bidirectional promoter with common sequence elements."
https://openalex.org/W1480588550,"Abstract Two molecular species of endoglycoceramidase (designated as endoglycoceramidases I and II) were purified 32,700 and 43,000 times with overall recoveries of 4.8 and 2.9%, respectively, from a culture fluid of the mutant strain M-750 of Rhodococcus sp., cultivated in the absence of inducers (ganglioside). After being stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue or a silver-staining solution, each purified enzyme showed a single protein band on polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in the presence and absence of sodium dodecyl sulfate. The apparent molecular weights, as estimated by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, were 55,900 for endoglycoceramidase I and 58,900 for endoglycoceramidase II, and their pIs were 5.3 and 4.5, respectively. both were capable of hydrolyzing the glucosylceramide linkage of ganglio-type, lacto-type, and globo-type glycosphingolipids to afford intact oligosaccharides and ceramides. Globo-type glycosphingolipids were strongly resistant to hydrolysis by endoglycoceramidase II in comparison with endoglycoceramidase I. Neither could hydrolyze gala-type glycosphingolipids, cerebrosides, sulfatides, glycoglycerolipids, or sphingomyelins. In addition to these two enzymes, the strain M-750 produced a third minor molecular species of endoglycoceramidase designated as endoglycoceramidase III. It was found capable of specifically hydrolyzing the galactosylceramide linkage of gala-type glycosphingolipids that were not hydrolyzable at all by endoglycoceramidases I or II. The molecular weights of the oligosaccharide and ceramide released from asialo GM1, incubated either in normal H2O or H2(18)O with the enzyme, were compared by fast atom bombardment-mass spectrometry. The result clearly indicated that both endoglycoceramidases I and II hydrolyze the glycosidic linkage between the oligosaccharide and ceramide. Thus, a systematic name of the endoglycoceramidase should be glycosyl-N-acyl-sphingosine 1,1-beta-D-glucanohydrolase."
https://openalex.org/W1572565610,"The metabolism of [14C]cholesterol- and [3H]retinol-labeled chylomicrons obtained from canine thoracic duct or rabbit mesenteric lymph was investigated in normal fasted rabbits. Typically, 70-80% of the chylomicrons injected into the rabbits were cleared from the plasma in 20 min, and their uptake was accounted for principally by the liver and the bone marrow. Surprisingly, the bone marrow was a major site of uptake; the uptake ranged from about half that of the liver to a nearly equal amount. The importance and specificity of chylomicron-chylomicron remnant uptake by the bone marrow were established by demonstrating that (a) bone marrow throughout the body accumulated these lipoproteins, (b) the level of uptake was consistent regardless of how the values were calculated or how the chylomicrons were prepared, (c) the uptake represented specific binding, and (d) radiolabeled intestinal lipoproteins induced in vivo delivered cholesterol and retinol to the marrow. Electron microscopic examination of the rabbit bone marrow established that perisinusoidal macrophages uniquely accounted for the uptake of the chylomicrons. Whereas liver cleared a variety of both triglyceride-rich lipoproteins (chylomicrons, chylomicron remnants, and very low density lipoproteins) and cholesterol-rich lipoproteins (beta-very low density lipoproteins and high density lipoproteins containing apolipoprotein E), bone marrow uptake appeared to be restricted to the triglyceride-rich lipoproteins. More chylomicron remnants (generated in a hepatectomized rabbit) were cleared by the liver than by the bone marrow, and the addition of excess apolipoprotein E to chylomicrons resulted in their preferential uptake by the liver. The role of chylomicron-chylomicron remnant delivery of lipids or lipid-soluble vitamins to rabbit bone marrow is open to speculation, and whether triglyceride-rich lipoprotein uptake occurs to a significant extent in the bone marrow of humans remains to be determined."
https://openalex.org/W1558227941,"Abstract Phosphorylation and dephosphorylation has been suggested to influence the function of glucocorticoid receptors, but evidence for hormone-dependent changes in the phosphorylation state under physiological conditions is lacking. Here we show that in intact WEHI-7 mouse thymoma cells, labeled for 18-20 h with [32P]orthophosphate and [35S]methionine, glucocorticoids rapidly increase the average number of phosphates on the steroid-binding protein approximately from three to five. This stimulation is agonist-dependent since the antiglucocorticoid RU 486 (17 beta-hydroxy-11 beta,4-dimethylaminophenyl-17 alpha-propynyl estra-4,9-diene-3-one) has no effect by itself and blocks the cortisol-induced phosphorylation. Furthermore, the salt-unextractable nuclear bound receptors lose at least two phosphates compared to cytosolic and nuclear extractable forms. These results show for the first time that these hormone-dependent transcription regulators undergo agonist-induced phosphorylation and dephosphorylation which may affect their activity."
https://openalex.org/W1518042594,"Abstract The insulin receptor purified from skeletal muscle of patients with non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) displayed a 25-55% reduction in insulin-stimulated autophosphorylation and tyrosyl-specific phosphotransferase activity relative to controls. This decrease was not explained by alterations of muscle fiber composition, insulin binding affinity or capacity, or the Km values for ATP; the lower kinase activity was entirely attributed to a decrease in the Vmax of the enzyme. Phosphorylation sites in the beta-subunit of the control and diabetic receptor were identified by tryptic digestion and reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography. Autophosphorylation occurred primarily in two regions of the beta-subunit: the regulatory region containing Tyr-1146, Tyr-1150, and Tyr-1151, and the C terminus containing Tyr-1316 and 1322. Autophosphorylation of the regulatory region at all three tyrosyl residues (tris-phosphorylation) appears to be necessary to activate the receptor kinase (White, M. F., Shoelson, S. E., Stepman, E. W., Keutmann, H. & Kahn, C. R. (1988) J. Biol. Chem. 263, 2969-2980). The receptor from NIDDM patients showed a decreased level of tris-phosphorylation of the regulatory region which was closely associated (r2 = 0.97) with the decreased kinase activity. In contrast, weak associations were found between kinase activity and the bis-phosphorylated forms of the regulatory region (r2 = 0.51) and the C terminus (r2 = 0.35). Therefore, the reduced formation of the tris-phosphorylated regulatory region in the diabetic receptors suggests that a defective autophosphorylation cascade leading to tris-phosphorylation of the regulatory region may cause, in part, the reduced insulin-stimulated kinase activity of the insulin receptor in muscle of NIDDM patients."
https://openalex.org/W1581140213,"Density gradient ultracentrifugation was used to isolate and characterize the plasma lipoproteins from African green monkeys before and 24 and 48 h after subcutaneous injection of 300 µg/kg lipopolysaccharide (LPS) to induce an acute phase response. Compared with 0 h values, reductions occurred in plasma cholesterol (39%), high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol (54%), lecithin:cholesterol acyltransferase (LCAT) activity (55%), and post-heparin plasma lipase activity (68%) 48 h after LPS injection while plasma triglyceride concentrations increased 700%. Cholesterol distribution among lipoproteins shifted from 7 to 41% in very low density lipoproteins (VLDL), 65 to 38% in low density lipoproteins (LDL), and 28 to 21% in HDL after LPS injection. At 48 h after LPS injection, all lipoprotein classes were relatively enriched in phospholipid and triglyceride and depleted of cholesteryl ester. The plasma concentration of all chemical constituents in VLDL was increased 3–9-fold within 48 h after LPS injection. By negative stain electron microscopy, HDL were discoidal in shape while VLDL and LDL appeared to have excess surface material present. Even though total HDL protein concentration in plasma was unaffected, the plasma mass of the smallest HDL subfractions (HDL3b,c) doubled while the mass of intermediate-sized subfractions (HDL3a) was dramatically decreased within 24 h after treatment. HDL became enriched in apoE, acquired apoSAA, and became depleted of apoA-I, A-II, and Cs by 48 h after LPS injection while apoB-100 remained the major apoprotein of VLDL and LDL. We conclude that administration of LPS to monkeys prevents normal intravascular metabolism of lipoproteins and results in the accumulation of relatively nascent forms of lipoproteins in plasma. These immature lipoproteins resemble those isolated from the recirculating perfusion of African green monkey livers, which are relatively deficient of LCAT activity and those isolated from the plasma of patients with familial LCAT deficiency."
https://openalex.org/W1501941180,"Cells incorporate isoprenoid products derived from mevalonate (MVA) into several unique proteins. The aim of this study was to delineate the effects of blocking MVA synthesis on the covalent isoprenylation of these proteins in murine erythroleukemia cells. Inhibition of protein synthesis with cycloheximide prevented the incorporation of [3H]MVA into proteins, suggesting that isoprenylation normally occurs immediately after synthesis of the polypeptides. However, incubation of cells with lovastatin, a competitive inhibitor of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase, for as little as 1 h prior to addition of cycloheximide rendered the isoprenylation step insensitive to cycloheximide. Lovastatin had no apparent effect on the stability of the isoprenylated proteins, but the development of cycloheximide insensitivity during the lovastatin preincubation was dependent on synthesis of new protein during that period. Addition of 50-200 microM MVA to the culture medium eliminated the effects of preincubation with lovastatin. Preincubation of cells with 25-hydroxycholesterol, which suppresses the synthesis and enhances the degradation of HMG-CoA reductase but is not a competitive enzyme inhibitor, did not induce cycloheximide-insensitivity of the isoprenylation reaction. The results suggest that blocking MVA synthesis with lovastatin causes a rapid depletion of isoprenoid groups available for protein modification. Consequently, there is an accumulation of non-isoprenylated substrate proteins. Shifts in the ratio of modified vs. unmodified proteins in response to MVA availability may have implications for the changes in cell morphology, cell proliferation and HMG-CoA reductase gene expression that occur when cells are subjected to MVA deprivation."
https://openalex.org/W1601616688,"Abstract A phospholipase A2 activity directed against phosphatidylcholine was previously described in brush-border membrane from guinea pig intestine (Diagne, A., Mitjavila, S., Fauvel, J., Chap, H., and Douste-Blazy, L. (1987) Lipids 22, 33-40). In the present study, this enzyme was solubilized either with Triton X-100 or upon papain treatment, suggesting a structural similarity with other intestinal hydrolases such as leucine aminopeptidase, sucrase, or trehalase. The papain-solubilized form, which is thought to lack the short hydrophobic tail responsible for membrane anchoring, was purified 1800-fold to about 90% purity by ion exchange chromatography on DEAE-Sephacel, gel filtration on Ultrogel AcA44, and hydrophobic chromatography on phenyl-Sepharose. Upon polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate, a main band with an apparent molecular mass of 97 kDa was detected under reducing and nonreducing conditions. In the latter case, phospholipase A2 activity could be recovered from the gel and was shown to coincide with the 97-kDa protein detected by silver staining. The enzyme activity was unaffected by EGTA and slightly inhibited by CaCl2. The purified enzyme displayed a similar activity against phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylethanolamine, whereas 1-O-alkyl-2-acyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine hydrolysis was reduced by 50% compared to diacylglycerophospholipids. Using phosphatidylcholine labeled with either [3H]palmitic acid or [14C]linoleic acid in the 1- or 2-positions, respectively, the purified enzyme catalyzed the removal of [3H]palmitic acid, although at a lower rate compared to [14C]linoleic acid. This resulted in the formation of sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine, but only 1-[3H]palmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine was detected as an intermediary product. In agreement with this, 1-acyl-2-lyso-sn-[14C]glycero-3-phosphocholine was deacylated at almost the same rate as the sn-2-position of phosphatidylcholine. Since upon sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, the two hydrolytic activities were detected at the same position as 97-kDa protein, the enzyme is thus considered as a phospholipase A2 with lysophospholipase activity (phospholipase B), which might be involved in phospholipid digestion."
https://openalex.org/W1485939620,"Reductive titrations of a NAD-dependent type (type-D) and an O2-dependent type (type-O) of rat liver xanthine dehydrogenase showed that only the type-D enzyme formed a pronounced stable FAD semiquinone (FADH*). The FAD semiquinone was less stabilized in the presence of NAD. The Vmax value for xanthine-NAD activity of type-D enzyme was close to that for xanthine-O2 activity of type-O enzyme, while the Vmax value for xanthine-O2 activity of type-D enzyme was about one-fourth of that of type-O enzyme. The Km value for O2 of type-D enzyme was about five times as large as that of type-O enzyme. The absorbance spectrum of type-D enzyme during turnover with xanthine and O2 as substrates showed a considerable amount of FADH* formation, but that with xanthine and NAD as substrates showed only a negligible one. Low xanthine-O2 activity of type-D enzyme, as compared with that of type-O enzyme, seems to be explained by the conformational change occurring in conversion from type-O to type-D enzyme, which results in different reactivity of FAD to molecular oxygen and a higher fraction of FADH* during turnover. The binding of NAD may possibly increase the fraction of FADH2, resulting in a Vmax value of xanthine-NAD activity almost as high as that of xanthine-O2 activity of type-O enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W1483870771,"Although beta actin mRNA is down-regulated during myogenesis, the beta actin promoter confers constitutive expression when joined to heterologous genes transfected into a variety of different cell backgrounds, including differentiated muscle. Normal promoter activity is dependent upon the binding of a ubiquitous factor to the CCAAT-box element. Loss or reduction in factor binding correlates with a major reduction in promoter activity both in vivo and in vitro. The binding domain covers approximately 23 base pairs as determined by DNase footprinting. Methylation of A and G residues in and adjacent to the CCAAT box results in the loss of factor binding. Mutations across the binding domain indicate that the sequence GCCAATCAG within the domain is sufficient as a recognition sequence for factor binding. This binding is not competed by the alpha cardiac actin CCAAT sequence. Bandshift experiments demonstrate a predominant single band of similar mobility in nuclear extracts from various cells and tissues, with the exception of HeLa cells. The prevalence of the factor and its recognition sequence in a variety of promoters suggests that this factor has a common role in the transcriptional activation of several eukaryotic promoters."
https://openalex.org/W1539336207,"Abstract A cDNA library of Ob1771 preadipocytes was constructed, and a cDNA clone designated pOb24 was isolated by differential screening. The pOb24 mRNA, 6 kilobases in length, rose sharply in early differentiating Ob1771 and 3T3-F442A cells and decreased thereafter. In mouse adipose tissue, it was present at a high level in stromal-vascular cells (containing adipose precursor cells) and at a low level in mature adipocytes. Thus, pOb24 mRNA appears to be both in vitro and in vivo an unique marker of the preadipose state, i.e. of cell commitment during adipose cell differentiation. In contrast to glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase mRNA, the emergence of pOb24 mRNA in Ob1771 cells required neither growth hormone or triiodothyronine as obligatory hormones nor insulin as a modulating hormone. Comparative studies of the expression of pOb24 and dihydrofolate reductase genes during the cell cycle suggest that arrest at the G1/S boundary was critical for the entry into the preadipose state. Tumor necrosis factor and transforming growth factor-beta were able to induce a large decrease of pOb24 mRNA level in growth-arrested Ob1771 cells. This decrease was shown to be only confined to early differentiating, glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase negative cells as no decrease of pOb24 mRNA level was observed in glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase positive cells. This result suggests that signals generated by tumor necrosis factor and transforming growth factor-beta have no effect on a commitment-related gene in late differentiated cells."
https://openalex.org/W1487893203,"Abstract For the first time completely reversible unfolding was achieved for guanidinium chloride-denatured rhodanese using a systematically defined protocol. These conditions included beta-mercaptoethanol, lauryl maltoside, and sodium thiosulfate. All components were required to get more than the previous best reactivation with lauryl maltoside of 17% (Tandon, S., and Horowitz, P. (1986) J. Biol. Chem. 261, 15615-15681). Non-coincidental transition curves were obtained by monitoring different parameters including: (i) variation in the activity, (ii) shifts of the fluorescence wavelength maximum, and (iii) variation in ellipticity at 220 nm. The transition followed by the fluorescence wavelength maximum was asymmetric and resolvable into two separate transitions. A thermodynamic analysis was used to define the energetics of the two processes. Studies with the fluorescent apolar probe 1,8ANS are consistent with the appearance of organized hydrophobic surfaces following the first transition. Near UV CD measurements indicated that the first transition is associated with a loss of dyssymmetry around at least some of the tryptophans. Thus, the unfolding of rhodanese is complex, and there are detectable intermediate(s) during the process. These results suggest that reversible unfolding occurs in two discrete stages: 1) loss of tertiary interactions and activity, with retention of secondary structure, and 2) loss of secondary structure. The available x-ray structure suggests that the first transition can be associated with changes in the domain interactions, which may modulate the effectiveness of helix dipoles in lowering the pKa of the active site sulfhydryl."
https://openalex.org/W1574215623,"We report for the first time that phospholipase D activity in sea urchin spermatozoa can be regulated by a component of egg jelly known to induce an acrosome reaction. The fucose-sulfate glycoconjugate (FSG) of egg jelly that induces an acrosome reaction in spermatozoa caused Ca2+-dependent increases in 1,2-diacylglycerol and phosphatidic acid. Diacylglycerol concentrations were increased 2-fold, and phosphatidic acid concentrations were elevated up to 10-fold 2 min after the addition of FSG to spermatozoa. FSG also caused increases in choline, but not in choline phosphate concentrations. Neither phosphorylation of diacylglycerol nor de novo synthesis from glycerol were significant routes of synthesis of phosphatidic acid during the acrosome reaction. When spermatozoa were incubated with FSG in the presence of ethanol, phosphatidylethanol was produced. As ethanol concentrations in the extracellular medium were increased from 0.1 to 2.5%, the amount of phosphatidylethanol increased, whereas phosphatidic acid concentrations decreased, suggesting a competitive transphosphatidylation reaction catalyzed by phospholipase D. Furthermore, when a phosphatidylcholine pool in spermatozoa was radiolabeled using [3H]1-O-alkyl-2-lyso-glycerol-3-phosphorylcholine, the subsequent addition of FSG caused a 4-fold accumulation of [3H]phosphatidic acid. FSG-induced elevations in [3H]phosphatidic acid were positively correlated with the percent of cells that had undergone an acrosome reaction."
https://openalex.org/W1574982452,"Abstract The inhibition of the autophosphorylation of the heme-regulated eukaryotic initiation factor (eIF)-2 alpha kinase (HRI) by hemin is very similar to that produced by thiol oxidation by diamide. The results obtained from the analysis of sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of unphosphorylated and phosphorylated HRI under reducing and nonreducing conditions indicate that hemin promotes disulfide formation in HRI. Hemin-promoted disulfide formation in HRI occurs under quasi-physiological conditions, i.e. 30 degrees C, 10 min at hemin concentrations of 5-10 microM. Under nondenaturing conditions, unphosphorylated HRI, phosphorylated HRI, hemin-treated unphosphorylated HRI, and hemin-treated prephosphorylated HRI are all eluted identically on Sephacryl S-300 column chromatography with an apparent molecular mass of 290,000 daltons. It appears, therefore, that the disulfide formation promoted by hemin occurs within the unit of 290,000 daltons. In addition, hemin treatment of phosphorylated HRI results in the appearance of a disulfide-linked form of higher molecular mass when analyzed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis under nonreducing conditions. A similar high molecular mass form is observed when HRI is treated with 1,6-bismaleimidohexane, a double sulfhydryl cross-linker agent, and the autophosphorylation of HRI and the phosphorylation of eIF-2 alpha by HRI are greatly diminished; these effects are similar to the effects of hemin on HRI. We conclude that disulfide formation by hemin provides a likely mechanism by which hemin prevents the activation and inhibits the activity of HRI."
https://openalex.org/W1596232811,"The lectin from jackfruit (Artocarpus integrifolia) seeds has been purified by Rivanol (6,9-diamino-2-ethoxyacridine lactate) treatment. The specific activity, molecular weights of parent lectin and its subunit, its glycoprotein nature, and hemagglutination-inhibition assays suggest that this preparation is identical to that obtained by affinity chromatography on melibiose-agarose adsorbent (Ahmed, H., and Chatterjee, B. P. (1986) in Lectins, Biology, Biochemistry, Clinical Biochemistry (Bog-Hansen, T. C., and van Driessche, E., eds) Vol. 5, pp. 125-133, Walter de Gruyter, New York). The lectin strongly agglutinates human and several animal erythrocytes. The lectin contains five isolectins of pI values 7.1, 6.85, 5.5, 5.3, and 5.1. It is thermally stable and loses its activity above 75 degrees C. The hemagglutinating activity remains unchanged in the presence of bivalent cations viz., Ca2+, Mg2+, Mn2+, etc. It is a metalloprotein. The lectin retains its activity by dialysis with acetic acid followed by EDTA. It agglutinates Ehrlich ascites cells. Equilibrium dialysis of lectin with melibiose and quenching of fluorescence of 4-methylumbelliferyl-alpha-D-galactopyranoside by the lectin show that homotetrameric jackfruit lectin has two sugar-binding sites. The lectin precipitates well several galactomannans and glycoproteins having terminal D-Gal-alpha-(1----6)- or D-Gal-beta-(1----3)-D-GalNAc residues. It hardly or does not precipitate polysaccharides having terminal D-Gal-alpha-(1----3) residues. Quantitative precipitin-inhibition studies using various haptens suggest that the -OCH2- group at C-1 and -OH groups at C-4 and partially at C-6 in the alpha-glycoside of D-galactose configuration are important for lectin-sugar interaction."
https://openalex.org/W1596596574,"Abstract Ca2+ is a major regulator of exocytosis in secretory cells, however, the biochemical mechanisms underlying regulation remain to be identified. To render the secretory apparatus accessible for biochemical studies, we have developed a cell permeabilization method (cell cracking) which utilizes mechanical shear. GH3 pituitary cells subjected to cracking were permeable to macromolecules but retained a normal cytoplasmic ultrastructure including secretory granules. Incubation of the permeable cells at 30-37 degrees C with 0.1-1.0 microM Ca2+ and millimolar MgATP resulted in the release of the secretory proteins, prolactin (PRL) and a proteoglycan, but not lysosomal enzymes. Extensively washed permeable cells were incapable of releasing PRL in response to Ca2+ and MgATP addition. However, addition of cytosol was found to restore Ca2+-activated, MgATP-dependent PRL release. The cytosolic factor responsible for activity was thermolabile and protease sensitive. The protein was partially purified, and its molecular mass was estimated to be equivalent to that of a globular protein of 200-350 kDa by molecular sieve chromatography. Inhibitors of calmodulin or protein kinase C (trifluroperazine, calmidazolium, H-7) failed to inhibit Ca2+-activated PRL release, and the required cytosolic protein could not be replaced by purified calmodulin, calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II, protein kinase C, or calpactin I. Further purification and characterization of the cytosolic protein should reveal the nature of biochemical events involved in regulated secretory exocytosis."
https://openalex.org/W1482637173,"Abstract Mouse L-cells infected with vaccinia virus produce a specific kinase inhibitory factor (SKIF) which inhibits the activation of the interferon-induced, double-stranded (ds)RNA-dependent, eukaryotic initiation factor (eIF)-2 alpha-specific protein kinase in L-cell extracts (Whitaker-Dowling, P., and Younger, J. S., (1984) Virology 137, 171). The effects of a partially purified preparation of SKIF have been examined in cell-free extracts of rabbit reticulocytes. Both the phosphorylation state of eIF-2 and protein synthetic activity have been determined. SKIF inhibits the phosphorylation of the alpha subunit of eIF-2 by dsRNA-dependent eIF-2 alpha-kinase in reticulocyte lysate, but does not affect phosphorylation of eIF-2 by the heme-sensitive kinase. In addition to its effects on eIF-2 alpha-PKds activity, SKIF prevents dsRNA-induced inhibition of protein synthesis in reticulocyte lysate. In contrast, SKIF does not prevent the translational inhibition caused by hemin depletion. These data provide a direct correlation between the effects of SKIF on eIF-2 alpha phosphorylation and on protein synthetic activity and demonstrate the specificity of SKIF. The results also show that SKIF does not abolish dsRNA sensitivity, but increases the concentration of dsRNA required to activate the kinase and phosphorylate eIF-2."
https://openalex.org/W1549751359,"A thermodynamic investigation of the hydrolysis of sucrose to fructose and glucose has been performed using microcalorimetry and high-pressure liquid chromatography. The calorimetric measurements were carried out over the temperature range 298-316 K and in sodium acetate buffer (0.1 M, pH 5.65). Enthalpy and heat capacity changes were obtained for the hydrolysis of aqueous sucrose (process A): sucrose(aq) + H2O(liq) = glucose(aq) + fructose (aq). The determination of the equilibrium constant required the use of a thermochemical cycle calculation involving the following processes: (B) glucose 1-phosphate2-(aq) = glucose 6-phosphate2-(aq); (C) sucrose(aq) + HPO4(2-)(aq) = glucose 1-phosphate2-(aq) + fructose(aq); and (D) glucose 6-phosphate2-(aq) + H2O(liq) = glucose(aq) + HPO4(2-)(aq). The equilibrium constants determined at 298.15 K for processes B and C are 17.1 +/- 1.0 and 32.4 +/- 3.0, respectively. Equilibrium data for process D was obtained from the literature, and in conjunction with the data for processes B and C, used to calculate a value of the equilibrium constant for the hydrolysis of aqueous sucrose. Thus, for process A, delta G0 = -26.53 +/- 0.30 kJ mol-1, K0 = (4.44 +/- 0.54) x 10(4), delta H0 = -14.93 +/- 0.16 kJ mol-1, delta So = 38.9 +/- 1.2 J mol-1 K-1, and delta CoP = 57 +/- 14 J mol-1 K-1 at 298.15 K. Additional thermochemical cycles that bear upon the accuracy of these results are examined."
https://openalex.org/W1490627870,"Abstract The interaction between superoxide dismutase (SOD) and peroxide, under anaerobic conditions in the presence of an OH radical scavenger, formate, and an indicator, nitro blue tetrazolium, involves five reactions and an equilibrium: (table; see text) Reaction 3 occurs at a rate that is proportional to both peroxide and enzyme with no kinetic evidence for any intermediate peroxide-enzyme complex. Rate studies as a function of pH corroborate previously published work (Fuchs, H. J. R., and Borders, C. L., Jr. (1983) Biochem Biophys. Res. Commun. 116, 1107-1113; Blech, D. M., and Borders, C. L., Jr. (1983) Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 224, 579-586) suggesting that HO2-, and not H2O2, is the active species in this system: k(HO2- + superoxide dismutase-Cu+) = 2.6 x 10(3) M-1 s-1. Evidence is presented which suggests that HO2-, like O2-, reacts at rates that are affected by the electrostatic forces of the enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W1588492473,"Abstract In adrenal glomerulosa cells, angiotensin II stimulates rapid increases in inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (Ins-1,4,5-P3) and inositol 1,3,4,5-tetrakisphosphate (Ins-1,3,4,5-P4), followed by slower increases in two additional inositol tetrakisphosphate (InsP4) isomers. One of these InsP4 isomers was previously identified as Ins-1,3,4,6-P4 and shown to be a precursor of inositol pentakisphosphate (InsP5). Analysis of the third InsP4 isomer, purified from cultured bovine adrenal cells labeled with [3H]inositol and stimulated by angiotensin II, revealed that the polyol produced by periodate oxidation, borohydrate reduction, and dephosphorylation was [3H]iditol. This finding is consistent with precursor structures of either Ins-1,4,5,6-P4 or Ins-3,4,5,6-P4 (= L-Ins-1,4,5,6-P4) for the third InsP4 isomer. The [3H]iditol was readily converted to [3H]sorbose by the stereospecific enzyme, L-iditol dehydrogenase, indicating that it originated from Ins-3,4,5,6-P4. Chicken erythrocytes labeled with [3H]inositol also contained high levels of Ins-1,3,4,6-P4 and Ins-3,4,5,6-P4, as well as InsP5, but only small amounts of Ins-1,3,4,5-P4. Both [3H]Ins-1,3,4,6-P4 and [3H]Ins-3,4,5,6-P4, but not [3H]Ins-1,3,4,5-P4, were phosphorylated to form InsP5 in permeabilized bovine glomerulosa cells. In addition, InsP5 itself was slowly dephosphorylated to Ins-1,4,5,6-P4, indicating that its structure is Ins-1,3,4,5,6-P5. These results demonstrate that the higher inositol phosphates are metabolically interrelated and are linked to the receptor-regulated InsP3 response by the conversion of Ins-1,3,4-P3 through Ins-1,3,4,6-P4 to Ins-1,3,4,5,6-P5. The source of Ins-3,4,5,6-P4, the other precursor of InsP5, is not yet known but its elevation in angiotensin II-stimulated glomerulosa cells suggests that its formation is also influenced by agonist-regulated processes."
https://openalex.org/W1657207262,"Abstract Pyrroline-5-carboxylate reductase catalyzes the final step in proline synthesis by NAD(P)H-dependent reduction of pyrroline-5-carboxylate. We have purified and characterized this enzyme from human erythrocytes. Purification to homogeneity (approximately 600,000-fold) was accomplished by sonication, ultracentrifugation, 2',5'-ADP-Sepharose affinity chromatography, and DEAE-Sephacel ion exchange chromatography. The enzyme runs as a single band of 30,000 Mr on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Sizing chromatography under nondenaturating conditions demonstrates activity in the 300,000-350,000 Mr range, suggesting that the native enzyme exists as a 10- to 12-mer. The purified enzyme exhibits kinetic characteristics similar to those previously described for whole red cell homogenates. The Vmax is 10-fold higher and the Km for pyrroline-5-carboxylate is 7-fold higher with NADH versus NADPH as cofactor. The affinity for NADPH is 15-fold higher than that for NADH. Erythrocyte pyrroline-5-carboxylate reductase is competitively inhibited by NADP+. Unlike the enzyme from some other sources, erythrocyte pyrroline-5-carboxylate reductase is not inhibited by proline or ATP. Double label studies using [14C]pyrroline-5-carboxylate and [3H]exNADPH in the presence of both NADH and NADPH were performed to determine the preferred source of reducing equivalents. In the presence of physiologic concentrations of pyrroline-5-carboxylate and both pyridine nucleotides, all of the reducing equivalents came from NADPH. We suggest that, in some cell types including human erythrocytes, a physiologic function of pyrroline-5-carboxylate reductase is the generation of NADP+."
https://openalex.org/W1572302781,"Metabolic control of oxidative metabolism was studied in perfused rat liver by means of phosphorus magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Oxygen consumption, ATP, and Pi were measured with different rates of gluconeogenesis and urea synthesis by varying concentrations of the substrates in the perfusate. Five levels of oxygen consumption (VO2) were obtained: an average control value of 1.94 +/- 0.14 and 2.93 +/- 0.25, 3.29 +/- 0.46, 3.85 +/- 0.26, and 4.18 +/- 0.56 mumol/min/g liver (mean +/- S.D., n = 6). The corresponding ATP concentrations were 2.51 +/- 0.20, 2.39 +/- 0.08, 2.24 +/- 0.09, 2.13 +/- 0.12, and 1.91 +/- 0.13 mM. Pi increased stoichiometrically with the decrease in ATP. Free Pi (Pif) was calculated as NMR-visible Pi in control plus -delta ATP (1.94 mM + (-delta ATP]. The kinetic relationship of oxidative phosphorylation as a function of Pif followed a Michaelis-Menten type of equation: VO2 = 5.55/(1 + 0.24/[( Pif] - 1.81]. The observed Km value for Pi of 0.24 mM approximates the reported Km value in isolated mitochondria of 1 mM. The free Pi concentration of 1.94 mM is in the range of the Km value, while the free ADP concentration of 200 microM exceeds the Km value of 20 microM. Therefore, it is suggested that Pi play a major role in the regulation of mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation in combined urea synthesis and gluconeogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W1548746280,"Abstract Glycine N-methyltransferase (EC 2.1.1.20) was recently identified as a major folate binding protein of rat liver cytosol (Wagner, C., and Cook, R. J. (1984) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 81, 3631-3634). Activity of the enzyme is inhibited when the natural folate ligand, 5-methyltetrahydropteroylpentaglutamate (5-CH3-H4PteGlu5), is bound. It has been suggested that glycine N-methyltransferase plays a role in regulating the availability of methyl groups in the liver. Purified transferase was phosphorylated in vitro by the catalytic subunit of cAMP-dependent protein kinase. If 5-CH3-H4PteGlu5 was first bound to the transferase, phosphorylation was inhibited. Phosphorylation of glycine N-methyltransferase in vitro increased its activity approximately 2-fold. 5-CH3-H4PteGlu5 inhibited the activity of newly phosphorylated enzyme as well as native enzyme. Freshly isolated rat hepatocytes incorporated 32P-labeled inorganic phosphate into this folate binding protein. Chemical analysis of purified enzyme showed about 0.55 mol of phosphate present per mol of glycine N-methyltransferase subunit. These results indicate that phosphorylation of glycine N-methyltransferase may provide a mechanism for modulating the activity of this enzyme and support its role in regulating the availability of methyl groups."
https://openalex.org/W1498373517,"We undertook the cloning of preproinsulin cDNAs from the South African clawed toad, Xenopus laevis, in order to study the role of insulin during embryogenesis in this species. We found that X. laevis contains two different preproinsulin cDNAs, both of which code for peptides containing 106 amino acids of typical structure but which differ by eight amino acids: one in the signal peptide, two in the B-chain, four in the C-peptide, and one in the A-chain. Southern blot analysis indicates that the two preproinsulin cDNAs identified correspond to two different nonallelic genes which we believe arose through a recent gene duplication within the amphibian radiation possibly during the development of tetraploidy in this species. Both genes are expressed, since we have recently identified the two corresponding insulins in pancreatic extracts of adult toads (Shuldiner, A.R., Bennett, C., Robinson, E.A., and Roth, J. (1989) Endocrinology, in press). These cDNAs represent the first amphibian preproinsulin sequences to be elucidated."
https://openalex.org/W1497163285,"Abstract The conformational properties of streptokinase (SK) have been assessed by the techniques of differential scanning calorimetry, circular dichroism (CD), and through a combinational approach employing several algorithms which are predictive of secondary structural characteristics. In low ionic strength buffers, SK undergoes a reversible two-state thermal transition with a temperature of maximum heat capacity (Tm) of 46.1 +/- 0.9, a delta Hcal of 98 +/- 11 kcal/mol and a delta Hcal/delta HvH of approximately 1. In high ionic strength buffers, similar calorimetric properties were obtained with the exception that the delta Hcal/delta HvH values were considerably less than 1, indicating the existence of an additional irreversible thermally induced alteration in the molecule, most likely resulting in its aggregation. The effect of pH on the thermal unfolding properties of SK was determined. The results demonstrated that single two-state thermal transitions were obtained, with progressively decreasing Tm values, as the pH was reduced from 6.4 to 3.4, indicating a destabilization of the entire molecule at reduced pH. In the alkaline region, between pH 8.4 and 9.4, stabilization of a separate region of the molecule was obtained, as evidenced by an increase in the delta Hcal/delta HvH to values approximating 2. CD analysis was performed in order to estimate secondary structural characteristics of SK. The best fit of secondary structural parameters to the experimental CD spectrum provided estimates of 17% helices, 28% beta-sheet, 21% beta-turns, and 34% disordered structures. Both the intensity of the spectral band at 208 nm and the level of antiparallel beta-sheet strongly suggest that SK is an alpha + beta protein."
https://openalex.org/W1528664004,"Abstract Induction of rat heme oxygenase is mediated by at least two factors: its substrate heme and heat shock (Shibahara, S., Muller, R.M., and Taguchi, H. (1987) J. Biol. Chem. 262, 12889-12892). We have identified the cis-acting element of the rat heme oxygenase gene (HO gene), that was specifically bound by a nuclear protein prepared from rat glioma cells. We have termed this protein as heme oxygenase transcription factor (HOTF), whose estimated molecular weight is about 40,000. The element identified is CCACCACGTGACTCGAG (-51/-35) located just upstream of TATA-like sequence. The functional studies indicate that this sequence is required for the accurate and efficient initiation of transcription from the HO gene promoter. Since the HOTF-binding element is similar to the upstream promoter sequence (UPS) of the adenovirus 2 major late promoter (Ad2MLP), we examined whether rat HOTF is homologous to the upstream stimulatory factor (USF) or major late transcription factor previously identified in HeLa cells, which interacts with the UPS and activates the transcription from the Ad2MLP. HOTF specifically binds to the UPS of Ad2MLP, whereas HOTF failed to form a stable complex with the mutated HOTF-binding element lacking a GTGA sequence (-44/-42 of the HO gene), the sequence of which is identical to a core sequence of the USF-binding sites. Moreover, we show that like USF, HOTF is heat stable. These results suggest that HOTF may be homologous to USF or the major late transcription factor. Since USF is present in uninfected cells, it is conceivable that the expression of the HO gene is regulated at least in part by USF."
https://openalex.org/W1547326260,"Abstract The entire rat pepsinogen C gene has been isolated from a rat genomic library, using the rat pepsinogen C cDNA as a probe. Southern blot analysis showed that there exists at least two rat pepsinogen C genes. The nucleotide sequences of the coding regions and the 5'- and 3'-flanking regions of one of the rat pepsinogen C genes have been determined. This gene is split into 9 exons interrupted by eight intervening sequences. The 5'-flanking region is similar to that of the human pepsinogen C gene, but only the former has the core sequence of the Sp1 binding site. The amount of transcripts of the rat pepsinogen C genes was found to increase during development, and a similar increase was shown to be induced by injection of hydrocortisone. As a candidate of a factor which regulates the transcription, we found a 25-kDa protein by Southwestern blotting. It binds to a specific site in the 5'-flanking region of the gene only in the presence of Mg2+ ion, and it is present in the nuclear fraction of the gastric mucosa but not of the liver."
https://openalex.org/W1574548557,"Abstract We have previously reported that a block of transcription elongation is functioning in vivo and in vitro within the leader sequences of SV40 and the adenovirus 2 major late transcription units and in the regulation of transcription of the P4 promoter of minute virus of mice. In the present study using the HeLa whole cell extract-Sarkosyl system with adenovirus 2 major late promoter as a template we have analyzed several basic parameters that can contribute to our understanding of the mechanism that regulates the elongation block at the adenovirus 2 attenuation site. We show that the elongation block is augmented at elevated temperatures (40-45 degrees C). The elongation block can be reversed by the addition of 0.2 M NaCl to the transcription reaction and the reversibility is temperature-dependent. Furthermore, while at 30-35 degrees C the elongation block is reversible with dilution of the Sarkosyl, at 40-45 degrees C it is only partially reversible. These results may indicate that a factor(s) is involved in the regulation of the elongation block and/or that the conformation of the transcription complex is temperature dependent. Finally, we show that the extent of the elongation block is dependent on the consecutive T residues at the attenuation site and we discuss the involvement of RNA secondary structure in eliciting the elongation block."

https://openalex.org/W1516262483,"When transferrin receptors of human erythroleukemic cells were pulse-labeled with [35S]methionine and then chased in the absence of radioactive precursor, the first detectable immunoprecipitable form of the receptor had a molecular mass of 85 kDa. This form of the receptor was converted to the mature form of 93 kDa with a half-time of about 40-60 min. Both the immature (85 kDa) and mature (93 kDa) receptors associated as dimers, the native form of the receptor. The 85-kDa, as well as the 93-kDa, receptors bound to a monoclonal antibody raised against the transferrin receptor or to transferrin-Sepharose. In order to determine whether glycosylation was necessary for ligand binding, purified receptors were isolated from cells grown in the presence of tunicamycin. When K562 cells were grown in the presence of tunicamycin, an 80-kDa nonglycosylated form of the receptor was synthesized. This nonglycosylated receptor was also capable of dimer formation; however, much less of it reached the cell surface than the fully glycosylated form, although both untreated and tunicamycin-grown cells appeared to synthesize transferrin receptors at similar rates. Although the number of receptor molecules/cell was similar in control and tunicamycin-treated cells, the nonglycosylated receptors exhibited a much lower affinity for transferrin than those of untreated cells; in contrast, when receptors were purified by immunoprecipitation and digested with bacterial alkaline phosphatase, no difference was observed between the affinity of these receptors and undigested immunoprecipitated receptors. These results suggest that glycosylation is not necessary for specific binding of transferrin to its receptor, but the affinity of this binding can be influenced greatly by the presence or absence of carbohydrate residues."
https://openalex.org/W1528373996,"Using computer simulation we have modeled the kinetics of cAMP-dependent protein kinase, type II, following transient pulses of cAMP. We show that under the appropriate physiological conditions, the kinase can remain activated 20 min or longer after the cessation of adenylate cyclase activation, in a process we term long-term activation. Long-term activation depends in part on the state of phosphorylation of the regulatory subunit, because phosphorylation of the regulatory subunit regulates the affinity of this subunit for the catalytic subunit. We have used our model to simulate experiments that have been performed on the kinetic and steady state activities of cAMP-dependent protein kinase and have found good agreement between the simulations and the experimental data. The effects of the activity of phosphodiesterase, adenylate cyclase, and protein phosphatase on the kinetics of cAMP-dependent protein kinase have been modeled, as have the effects of different ratios of regulatory subunit to catalytic subunit. We have also simulated the activation of the cAMP-dependent protein kinase in Drosophila learning and memory mutants having primary or secondary defects in the cAMP cascade. We make predictions regarding the behavior of different mutants, which are in line with the experimental data. The model corroborates the assumption that the cAMP cascade may play a role in learning and short-term memory."
https://openalex.org/W1557061076,"Antithrombin is a plasma protein inhibitor that can be grouped within a serine proteinase inhibitor superfamily. Antithrombin Pescara is a functional variant of antithrombin found in a family with a high incidence of thrombosis. Preliminary functional analysis has suggested that the abnormality resides in the reactive site rather than in the heparin binding domain of the molecule. Accordingly, we have isolated the variant from plasma using heparin-Sepharose chromatography, followed by chromatography upon thrombin-Sepharose to remove the normal antithrombin that is present (the propositus is heterozygous for the variant). The variant protein was reduced, S-carboxy-methylated, and fragmented with CNBr. A pool (CNBr pool 4) containing the reactive site region was isolated by reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography and sequentially treated with trypsin and V8 protease. Fast atom bombardment-mass spectrometric analysis of this subdigest identified a novel peptide of mass 1708. Four steps of Edman degradation together with further analysis by fast atom bombardment-mass spectroscopy identified the NH2-terminal sequence of this peptide as Ala-Ala-Ala-Ser. The mass of the novel peptide and its changing mass in response to Edman degradation are only compatible with its identity as Ala382-Arg399, with the reactive site Arg393 replaced by Pro. Using specific oligonucleotide hybridization, we demonstrated that the molecular defect of antithrombin Pescara is caused by a CGT to CCT mutation in codon 393. These findings may be of broad interest, as other members of the serine protease inhibitor superfamily contain arginine at their reactive sites and may be expected to undergo a similar mutation."
https://openalex.org/W1600287050,"Abstract The current paper describes a solid phase ligand binding assay for the low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor that takes advantage of the domain structure of the protein. An antibody directed against one domain, e.g. the cytoplasmic tail, is adsorbed to a microtiter well. A detergent solution containing the LDL receptor is added, and the receptor is allowed to bind to the antibody. The wells are then washed, and one of the following radioiodinated ligands is added: 125I-LDL or an 125I-labeled monoclonal antibody directed against a different domain than the antibody adsorbed to the well. Under these conditions, the human LDL receptor shows high affinity for 125I-LDL and for 125I-IgG-HL1, a monoclonal antipeptide antibody directed against a 10-amino-acid linker between repeats 4 and 5 in the ligand binding domain. The binding affinity is the same at 4 degrees C and 37 degrees C. The binding of 125I-LDL and 125I-IgG-HL1 occurs with 1:1 molar stoichiometry, suggesting that the human LDL receptor binds 1 mol of LDL per mol of receptor. The acid-dependent dissociation of 125I-LDL and 125I-labeled monoclonal antibody from LDL receptors that is observed in intact cells was also shown to occur in the solid phase binding assay. We used the solid phase assay to demonstrate the secretion of LDL receptors from monkey cells that have been transfected with a cDNA encoding a truncated form of the human receptor that lacks the membrane-spanning domain. This assay may be useful in measuring the relative amounts of the intact LDL receptor in tissue extracts and the secreted receptor in transfected cells."
https://openalex.org/W1526645657,"We have previously suggested that transcription elongation by RNA polymerase II can be blocked when the nascent RNA is folded into a stem-and-loop structure followed by polyuridines. As an approach to test this suggestion in vitro, several GC-rich deoxyoligonucleotides with dyad symmetries were chemically synthesized and inserted following the adenovirus 2 major late promoter. These constructs were transcribed in vitro using HeLa whole cell extract. The transcripts of the synthetic inserts can potentially form stem-and-loop structures with destabilization energy from 0 to −48 kcal followed by 3, 5, and 8 U residues. The results obtained show that transcription elongation is blocked by these synthetic inserts and that the extent of the elongation block is directly correlated to the stabilities of the potential stem-and-loop structure and the proceeding number of U residues. Three levels of elongation blocks were observed: a brief pause of the polymerase occurs when the RNA could be folded into a secondary structure or when there were 5–6 T residues on the sense DNA strand. An extended pause occurred when the number of T residues on the sense DNA strand was increased to 8. Transcription termination, with a partial release of the attenuated transcript occurred when a stable RNA secondary structure (ΔG = −48 kcal) was followed by 8 U residues. The relevancy of these in vitro results to the in vivo mechanism of a transcription elongation block is discussed."

Amino acid sequencing of the purified peptide revealed that the peptide consists of 63 amino acid residues.

The inhibitory function and the kinetic characteristics of the inhibition have been examined with various substrates. The peptide possibly plays a role as an acrosin inhibitor involved in Drosophila reproduction.
https://openalex.org/W1589731672,"Abstract Stathmin is a ubiquitous soluble protein (Mr approximately 19,000, pI approximately 6.2-5.5) whose phosphorylation is associated with the intracellular mechanisms involved in the regulations of cell differentiation and functions by extracellular effectors. Its purification from rat brain and the preparation of specific antibodies allowed us to identify a set of immunologically related unphosphorylated (N1, N2) and phosphorylated (P1, P2a, P2b, P3) proteins of decreasing isoelectric points. All these proteins yielded identical silver-stained or 32P-radioactive peptide maps with the protease V8 from Staphylococcus aureus, indicating that they are also structurally related. In vitro phosphorylation with the exogenous catalytic subunit of the cAMP-dependent protein kinase, as well as dephosphorylation with alkaline phosphatase, indicated that P1, P2, and P3 derived from N1 and N2 by progressive phosphorylation. Phosphorylation of individual proteins extracted from semi-preparative two-dimensional polyacrylamide gels demonstrated the existence of two distinct isoforms of stathmin, alpha and beta: N1 and N2 are their respective unphosphorylated forms (alpha O and beta O), whereas proteins P1-P3 could be resolved as at least three increasingly phosphorylated forms of both alpha and beta stathmin (alpha 1, alpha 2, alpha(3) and beta 1, beta 2, beta(3]. In intact pituitary GH4C1 cells, hormones like thyrotropin-releasing hormone and vasoactive intestinal peptide induced a similar conversion from N1 and N2 to P1, P2, and P3. The phosphorylation of both alpha and beta isoforms of stathmin is therefore a physiologically significant response to specific extracellular regulatory agents. In conclusion, stathmin represents a family of at least two distinct protein isoforms, whose respective phosphorylation and expression might play a role in its likely function as an intracellular relay of various converging extracellular signals."
https://openalex.org/W1586013420,"Heparin and heparin fragments in the molecular mass range 1,700-20,000 Da were examined for their ability to accelerate the antithrombin III (AT III)-dependent inhibition of human factor Xa and the prothrombin converting complex (prothrombinase) during human prothrombin activation. The prothrombinase reaction was modeled by a 3-parameter 2-exponential equation to determine the initial rate of prothrombin activation and the pseudo-first order rate constants of inhibition of prothrombinase and in situ generated thrombin activity. The catalytic specific activities of the heparins increased with increasing molecular size for both the inhibition of prothrombinase and factor Xa. A 10-fold increase over the entire Mr range was found. In contrast to results obtained by others (Ellis, V., Scully, M. F., and Kakkar, V. V. (1986) Biochem. J. 233, 161-165; Barrowcliffe, T. W., Havercroft, S. J., Kemball-Cook, G., and Lindahl, U. (1987) Biochem. J. 243, 31-37), all the heparins showed a 5-fold higher rate of inhibition of factor Xa when compared with the inhibition of prothrombinase, indicating that the factor Va-mediated protection of factor Xa from inhibition by AT III/heparin is independent of the molecular size of the heparin. Our original approach has also revealed a hitherto unrecognized phenomenon, namely, in addition to the accelerating effect of the heparins on the rate of formation of the inactive AT III-factor Xa complex, heparins with Mr greater than 4,500 reduce the initial rate of thrombin generation in the presence of AT III in a concentration-dependent way. We hypothesize that the formation of the dissociable ternary AT III-heparin-factor Xa complex results in a (partial) loss of factor Xa activity towards its natural substrate prothrombin."

(1985) J. Biochem. (Tokyo) 98, 581-584). The dissociated primase and DNA polymerase alpha have been purified sufficiently that there was no cross-contamination with each other. By the use of thus isolated DNA primase and DNA polymerase alpha in addition to DNA primase-DNA polymerase alpha complex, we have studied primer RNA synthesis and DNA elongation separately as well as the coupled reaction of the initiation and elongation of DNA chains. In the absence of deoxyribonucleoside triphosphates, the isolated primase synthesized oligoribonucleotides of an apparent length of 7-11 nucleotides (monomeric oligomer) and multiples of a modal length of 9-10 nucleotides (multimeric oligomer) and fd phage single-stranded circular DNA. Monomeric and dimeric oligomers were synthesized processively, and trimeric and larger oligomers were produced by repeated cycles of processive synthesis. The primase complexed with DNA polymerase alpha mainly synthesized monomeric and a small amount of dimeric oligomers. In the presence of deoxyribonucleoside triphosphates at concentrations above 10 microM, the DNA primase-DNA polymerase alpha complex exclusively synthesized monomeric oligomers only, which were utilized as primers for DNA synthesis. On the other hand, the products synthesized by the isolated primase were qualitatively unchanged as compared with those synthesized in the absence of DNA precursors. When the synthesis of oligomers by the isolated primase was coupled with DNA elongation by the addition of the primase-free DNA polymerase alpha, the synthesis of dimeric oligomers was inhibited as a result of efficient DNA elongation from monomeric oligomers."
https://openalex.org/W1515966319,"Abstract Amino acid racemases inherently catalyze the exchange of alpha-hydrogen of amino acids with deuterium during racemization in 2H2O. When the reactions catalyzed by alanine racemase (EC 5.1.1.1) and L-alanine dehydrogenase (EC 1.4.1.1), which is pro-R specific for the C-4 hydrogen transfer of NADH, are coupled in 2H2O, [4R-2H]NADH is exclusively produced. Similarly, [4S-2H]NADH is made in 2H2O with amino-acid racemase with low substrate specificity (EC 5.1.1.10) and L-leucine dehydrogenase (EC 1.4.1.9), which is pro-S specific. We have established a simple procedure for the in situ analysis of stereospecificity of C-4 hydrogen transfer of NADH by an NAD-dependent dehydrogenase by combination with either of the above two couples of enzymes in the same reaction mixture. When the C-4 hydrogen of NAD+ is fully retained after sufficient incubation, the stereospecificity of hydrogen transfer by a dehydrogenase is the same as that of alanine dehydrogenase or leucine dehydrogenase. However, when the C-4 hydrogen of NAD+ is exchanged with deuterium, the enzyme to be examined shows the different stereospecificity from alanine dehydrogenase or leucine dehydrogenase. Thus, we can readily determine the stereospecificity by 1H NMR measurement without isolation of the coenzymes and products."

https://openalex.org/W1532325537,"Abstract The effect of Zn(II) in 3,5,3'-triiodo-L-thyronine (T3) binding to nuclear receptors was studied in dialyzed 0.4 M NaCl extracts of nuclei from cultured GC cells. Addition of ZnCl2 to nuclear extracts resulted in a time- and concentration-dependent dissociation of T3 from nuclear receptors. Half-maximal dissociation occurred at 6 microM ZnCl2. Addition of ZnCl2 also resulted in a concentration-dependent inhibition of binding of T3 to nuclear receptors. Half-maximal inhibition of binding occurred at 1-3 microM ZnCl2. Scatchard analysis indicated that Zn(II) addition decreased kA and did not alter receptor concentration. These effects of Zn(II) were prevented when ZnCl2 was added to nuclear extracts in the presence of 5 mM EDTA or 5 mM dithiothreitol. Moreover, Zn(II)-induced inhibition of T3 binding was reversed by the addition of 5 mM EDTA. The inhibitory effect of Zn(II) on T3 binding seemed specific for nuclear receptors; no effect of Zn(II) on the binding of T3 to proteins in rat serum or GC cell cytosol or to rabbit anti-T3 serum was observed. Cd(II) had a similar concentration-dependent inhibition of T3 binding to nuclear receptors which was reversible. Our findings suggest that Zn(II) may play a role in T3 binding to nuclear receptors as well as its putative role in the binding of receptor to DNA."
https://openalex.org/W1616967529,"Abstract We have demonstrated that a synthetic peptide corresponding to the rat mitochondrial malate dehydrogenase (mMDH) transit peptide (TP-28) inhibits the binding of pre-mMDH to isolated mitochondria. Synthetic peptides derived from chloroplast transit peptide sequences, which have a similar net charge, did not inhibit import. In addition, this peptide (TP-28) inhibits import of ornithine transcarbamylase, another mitochondrial matrix protein, thus suggesting that common import pathways exist for both mMDH and ornithine transcarbamylase. A smaller synthetic peptide corresponding to residues 1-20 of the mMDH transit peptide (TP-20) also inhibits binding. However, several substitutions for leucine-13 in the smaller peptide relieve import inhibition, thus providing evidence that this neutral residue plays a crucial role in transit peptide binding to the mitochondrial surface. Proteolytic processing of pre-mMDH by a mitochondrial matrix fraction to both the mature and intermediate forms of mMDH was also inhibited by TP-28. The ability of synthetic peptides to inhibit distinct steps in the import of mitochondrial precursor proteins corresponds precisely to their ability to interact with the same components used by transit peptides on intact precursors. Furthermore, inhibition at multiple points along the import pathway reflects the functions of several independent structures contained within transit peptides."
https://openalex.org/W1603145991,"Dolichyl ester hydrolase activity is broadly distributed among the organs of the rat. The highest activity was found in spleen, brain, lung, and thyroid tissues, whereas this activity is very low in stomach and intestine. The esterase involved is localized to the lumen of lysosomes and, to some extent, in the plasma membranes. Hydrolysis occurs with both alpha-saturated and alpha-unsaturated polyisoprenes esterified with different fatty acids, but the rate of hydrolysis is strongly dependent on the nature of the substrate. The enzyme involved is inhibited by divalent cations, EDTA and EGTA and also by one of the products, dolichol. The esterase is activated by 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl) dimethylammonio]-1-propranesulfonic acid and taurodeoxycholate and inhibited by Triton X-100. Dolichyl esterase activity is completely inhibited by alpha- and beta-naphthyl acetate, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and beta-chloromethylmercurisulfate. These inhibitors, as well as the pH optimum for dolichyl ester hydrolysis, clearly differentiate the enzyme involved from cholesteryl esterase and triglyceride lipase. Microsomal phospholipase A hydrolyzes dolichyl esters at a slow rate only. In vivo labeling experiments with [3H]mevalonate demonstrated that newly synthesized dolichol is transported in esterified form to the lysosomes, where this lipid is slowly hydrolyzed by the esterase. The possibility is raised that the role of the fatty acyl moiety may be to target dolichol to its final location in the cell."
https://openalex.org/W1531677992,"A new class of alkyl glycerolipids, 1-alkyl-2-acyl-3-(2',3'-diacylglycerol)glycerols, was identified in lipid extracts prepared from harderian gland tumors of mice. After saponification, this lipid class yielded 1-alkyl-3-(1'-glycerol)glycerols. Identification was based on mass spectrometry, proton nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, infrared spectroscopy, and chromatography of various derivatives and appropriate standards that were synthesized. The alkyl moieties of this unique lipid class consisted of saturated aliphatic chains with chain lengths of 14 to 20 carbon atoms. The acyl moieties were mostly saturated and monounsaturated aliphatic chains ranging from 14 to 24 carbon atoms. The alkyl and acyl moieties of 1-alkyl-2-acyl-3-(2',3'-diacylglycerol)glycerols were similar to those of alkyldiacylglycerols present in the same tissue, except for the presence of monounsaturated alkyl moieties in the latter. 1-Alkyl-2-acyl-3-(2', 3'-diacylglycerol)glycerols were only found in trace amounts in the normal harderian glands of mice. The total quantity of the alkyl and acyl moieties with a chain length greater than 20 carbon atoms in the alkyldiacylglycerols from tumors were considerably lower than those found in normal harderian glands of mice. This is the first report of the presence of bisglyceryl ether lipids in mammalian tissue; its unique chemical structure is consistent with the type of ether-linked lipid products that could be synthesized in the reaction catalyzed by alkyldihydroxyacetone-P synthase."
https://openalex.org/W1603650412,"Abstract Single crystals of the calcium-binding peptide AcA98STnC (90-123)amide, which is a synthetic fragment analog of rabbit skeletal troponin C calcium-binding site III, have been grown in the tetragonal crystal system. Crystals were developed to a maximum size of 0.60 x 0.60 x 0.75-mm by the technique of washing and reseeding. The space group is I41 with a = 40.21(1) A, c = 34.07(1) A; there is 1 polypeptide fragment/crystallographic asymmetric unit, and the solvent content is estimated to be 29%. The crystals diffract to at least 1.8-A d spacings and are stable in the x-ray beam for 1 week."
https://openalex.org/W1575701723,"Abstract We have used an Eppendorf centrifuge for isolation of transcription complexes assembled on VARNA genes and other related genes with NTP-depleted cell-free extracts. Similar to the 5 S rRNA gene, sedimentable, stable transcription preinitiation complexes could be assembled from two VARNA genes, two EB virus-specific EBER genes, four human tRNA genes, and one human Alu-family RNA gene, suggesting that the 5 S rRNA-specific transcription factor, TFIIIA, was not required for formation of these sedimentable, stable preinitiation complexes. Parameters affecting assembly of these complexes were sequences in circular DNA templates, sizes and sequences of linear DNA templates, temperature and incubation time. These complexes were stable at from 4 to 37 degrees C, and somewhat stable to salt wash. From results of effects of various mutations on assembly of these sedimentable complexes, we concluded that they were transcription machineries. Addition of the supernatant and partially purified factors to salt-washed complexes stimulated their transcription, we concluded that these sedimentable complexes were minimal transcription machineries containing suboptimal quantities of loosely bound transcription factors, TFIIIB, and RNA polymerase III. DNase 1 footprints of these sedimentable preinitiation complexes showed that two regions were protected, from +34 to +80 including the B block promoter element, and from +98 to +105. Similar DNase 1 footprints were also obtained from salt-washed complexes and stable preinitiation complexes isolated by molecular sieve column chromatography."
