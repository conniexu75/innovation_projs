https://openalex.org/W2016332933,"The causes of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), a devastating human neurodegenerative disease, are poorly understood, although the protein TDP-43 has been suggested to have a critical role in disease pathogenesis. Here we show that ataxin 2 (ATXN2), a polyglutamine (polyQ) protein mutated in spinocerebellar ataxia type 2, is a potent modifier of TDP-43 toxicity in animal and cellular models. ATXN2 and TDP-43 associate in a complex that depends on RNA. In spinal cord neurons of ALS patients, ATXN2 is abnormally localized; likewise, TDP-43 shows mislocalization in spinocerebellar ataxia type 2. To assess the involvement of ATXN2 in ALS, we analysed the length of the polyQ repeat in the ATXN2 gene in 915 ALS patients. We found that intermediate-length polyQ expansions (27-33 glutamines) in ATXN2 were significantly associated with ALS. These data establish ATXN2 as a relatively common ALS susceptibility gene. Furthermore, these findings indicate that the TDP-43-ATXN2 interaction may be a promising target for therapeutic intervention in ALS and other TDP-43 proteinopathies."
https://openalex.org/W2034143604,"Eusocial insects, including ants and many wasp and bee species, form hierarchical communities comprising reproductive queens and sterile workers. This means that some individuals sacrifice their own reproductive potential in order to raise the offspring of others, a fact that Darwin recognized as a challenge to evolutionary theory. The most widely accepted explanations for the phenomenon rely on kin selection theory based on inclusive fitness — individual fitness derived by increasing the survival of a relatives' offspring. In an Analysis feature, Martin Nowak, Corina Tarnita and Edward O. Wilson point out that this approach has its limitations. They demonstrate mathematically that inclusive fitness is a viable alternative to the direct fitness of standard natural selection only for a well-defined subset of situations — it is not generally applicable. A simpler explanation is provided by standard natural selection theory in the context of precise models of population structure. Eusociality, in which some individuals reduce their own lifetime reproductive potential to raise the offspring of others, underlies the most advanced forms of social organization and the ecologically dominant role of social insects and humans. For the past four decades kin selection theory, based on the concept of inclusive fitness, has been the major theoretical attempt to explain the evolution of eusociality. Here we show the limitations of this approach. We argue that standard natural selection theory in the context of precise models of population structure represents a simpler and superior approach, allows the evaluation of multiple competing hypotheses, and provides an exact framework for interpreting empirical observations."

https://openalex.org/W2026597179,"The small GTPase Ran enzyme regulates critical eukaryotic cellular functions including nuclear transport and mitosis through the creation of a RanGTP gradient around the chromosomes. This concentration gradient is created by the chromatin-bound RCC1 (regulator of chromosome condensation) protein, which recruits Ran to nucleosomes and activates Ran's nucleotide exchange activity. Although RCC1 has been shown to bind directly with the nucleosome, the molecular details of this interaction were not known. Here we determine the crystal structure of a complex of Drosophila RCC1 and the nucleosome core particle at 2.9 Å resolution, providing an atomic view of how a chromatin protein interacts with the histone and DNA components of the nucleosome. Our structure also suggests that the Widom 601 DNA positioning sequence present in the nucleosomes forms a 145-base-pair nucleosome core particle, not the expected canonical 147-base-pair particle."

Here, we show that several Rab-dependent trafficking pathways differentially participate in neuronal migration, an essential step for the formation of the mammalian-specific six-layered brain structure. In vivo electroporation-mediated suppression of Rab5 or dynamin to block endocytosis caused a severe neuronal migration defect in mouse cerebral cortex. Among many downstream endocytic pathways, suppression of Rab11-dependent recycling pathways exhibited a similar migration disorder, whereas inhibition of Rab7-dependent lysosomal degradation pathways affected only the final phase of neuronal migration and dendrite morphology. Inhibition of Rab5 or Rab11 perturbed the trafficking of N-cadherin, whose suppression also disturbed neuronal migration. Taken together, our findings reveal physiological roles of endocytic pathways, each of which has specific functions in distinct steps of neuronal migration and maturation during mammalian brain formation.

The formation of the six-layered cortex is largely dependent on the neuronal migration from the ventricular zone to the superficial layer of the cortical plate (Takahashi et al., 1999Takahashi T. Goto T. Miyama S. Nowakowski R.S. Caviness Jr., V.S. Sequence of neuron origin and neocortical laminar fate: relation to cell cycle of origin in the developing murine cerebral wall.J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 10357-10371Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). During the migration, neurons exhibit various morphological changes, which are also thought to be associated with brain malformations (Kawauchi and Hoshino, 2008Kawauchi T. Hoshino M.

Postmitotic neurons, generated near the ventricle, first display a multipolar morphology in the lower part of the intermediate zone (multipolar cell accumulation zone; Tabata et al., 2009Tabata H.

Cortex. 2009; 19: 2092-2105Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), and subsequently transform into bipolar-shaped locomoting neurons, which have a leading process, in the upper part of the intermediate zone. After migrating over a long distance along a radial glial fiber, which functions as a scaffold for migrating neurons, locomoting neurons change their migration mode into a terminal translocation mode and the leading processes mature into apical dendrites at the final phase of migration (Hatanaka and Murakami, 2002Hatanaka Y.

It has been reported that causative gene products of lissencephaly or PVH, such as Lis1 and DCX or filamin A, respectively, are involved in the regulation of microtubules and actin cytoskeleton (Ayala et al., 2007Ayala R.

Hoshino M. Molecular pathways regulating cytoskeletal organization and morphological changes in migrating neurons.Dev. Neurosci. 2008; 30: 36-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Furthermore, we found that c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (Cdk5) regulate the morphological changes of migrating neurons through the promotion of microtubule dynamics and actin reorganization (Kawauchi et al., 2003Kawauchi T. Chihama K. Nabeshima Y. Hoshino M.

Cell Biol. 2006; 8: 17-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). It has been also reported that the nuclear movement in the locomoting neurons is dependent on coordinated regulation of the cytoskeleton (Schaar and McConnell, 2005Schaar B.T. McConnell S.K.

Nucleokinesis in neuronal migration.Neuron. 2005; 46: 383-388Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). These findings indicate the essential roles of cytoskeletal regulation in the migration and morphological changes of neurons, and thereby in cortical layer formation and normal brain functions. Recently, ArfGEF2 was identified as a causative gene for PVH (Sheen et al., 2004Sheen V.L. Ganesh V.S. Topcu M. Sebire G. Bodell A. Hill R.S. Grant P.E. Shugart Y.Y. Imitola J. Khoury S.J. et al.Mutations in ARFGEF2 implicate vesicle trafficking in neural progenitor proliferation and migration in the human cerebral cortex.Nat. Genet. 2004; 36: 69-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). ArfGEF2/Big2 is localized at the Golgi apparatus and recycling endosome (Shin et al., 2004Shin H.W. Morinaga N. Noda M. Nakayama K. BIG2, a guanine nucleotide exchange factor for ADP-ribosylation factors: its localization to recycling endosomes and implication in the endosome integrity.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 5283-5294Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar), implicating the possible involvement of membrane trafficking in cortical development. Genome-wide analysis showed that the ratio of human kinase genes that are predicted to be involved in endocytosis is quite high (Pelkmans et al., 2005Pelkmans L. Fava E. Grabner H. Hannus M. Habermann B. Krausz E. Zerial M. Genome-wide analysis of human kinases in clathrin- and caveolae/raft-mediated endocytosis.Nature. 2005; 436: 78-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar), and that membrane trafficking-related protein families are evolutionally expanded in humans (Pereira-Leal and Seabra, 2001Pereira-Leal J.B. Seabra M.C. Evolution of the Rab family of small GTP-binding proteins.J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 313: 889-901Crossref PubMed Scopus (585) Google Scholar). These facts suggest that, in addition to basic cellular functions, membrane trafficking may have important roles in higher organisms or mammals, including the formation of cerebral cortex with a complex six-layered structure. However, physiological roles of membrane trafficking in higher organisms are largely unknown. Recent in vitro studies indicate that proper trafficking of integrin, a cell adhesion molecule involved in cell-to-extracellular matrix, is required for the migration of nonneuronal cells (Ezratty et al., 2009Ezratty E.J. Bertaux C. Marcantonio E.E. Gundersen G.G. Clathrin mediates integrin endocytosis for focal adhesion disassembly in migrating cells.J. Cell Biol. 2009; 187: 733-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). It raises the possibility that membrane trafficking might play a role in neuronal migration during cerebral cortical development. However, the involvement of membrane trafficking in mammalian brain construction is still unclear. One of the major hurdles is that membrane trafficking is very complex cellular events as each cell contains many trafficking pathways that are regulated by numerous molecules, which makes it difficult to carry out in vivo experiments, including knockout analyses. Previously, we and others have established an in vivo gene transfer method, in utero electroporation, which allows us to analyze the functions of many molecules in vivo (Kawauchi et al., 2003Kawauchi T. Chihama K. Nabeshima Y. Hoshino M. The in vivo roles of STEF/Tiam1, Rac1 and JNK in cortical neuronal migration.EMBO J. 2003; 22: 4190-4201Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar, Saito and Nakatsuji, 2001Saito T. Nakatsuji N.

Efficient in utero gene transfer system to the developing mouse brain using electroporation: visualization of neuronal migration in the developing cortex.Neuroscience. 2001; 103: 865-872Crossref PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar). In this study, our analyses, by use of in utero electroporation, indicate the in vivo roles of endocytic pathways in neuronal migration and morphological changes during the development of cerebral cortex. We also found that, among many endocytic pathways, the Rab11-dependent recycling pathway and Rab7-dependent lysosomal degradation pathway regulate different steps of neuronal migration and maturation, suggesting that the sensitivities of neurons for each membrane trafficking pathway progressively change as they mature. To test the possible involvement of the endocytic pathways in cortical development, we first tried to express a dominant-negative form for dynamin I (K44A) (DN-Dyn-K44A), which inhibits almost all types of endocytosis (Altschuler et al., 1998Altschuler Y. Barbas S.M. Terlecky L.J. Tang K. Hardy S. Mostov K.E. Schmid S.L. Redundant and distinct functions for dynamin-1 and dynamin-2 isoforms.J.

The dynamin superfamily: universal membrane tubulation and fission molecules?.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2004; 5: 133-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (1059) Google Scholar), in migrating neurons. Using in utero electroporation, a DN-Dyn-K44A-expressing vector was electroporated into embryonic cerebral cortices at embryonic day 14 (E14), and the brains were fixed at postnatal day 0 (P0), 5 days after electroporation. The electroporated cells were visualized with coexpressing EGFP. While control vector-electroporated cells migrated to reach the superficial layer of the cortical plate, DN-Dyn-K44A-expressing cells were stalled at the intermediate zone at P0 (Figure 1A ). In addition, the number of EGFP-positive cells was decreased in DN-Dyn-K44A-electroporated cortices. When electroporated at E14, DN-Dyn-K44A-expressing cells migrate normally out of the VZ at E16 but many are missing at E17 probably due to cell death (Figure S1A). When a weaker form of DN-dynamin I (DN-Dyn-ΔPRD) (Ferguson et al., 2009Ferguson S.M. Raimondi A. Paradise S. Shen H. Mesaki K. Ferguson A. Destaing O. Ko G. Takasaki J.

Chem. 1997; 272: 11629-11635Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) was expressed, DN-Dyn-ΔPRD-electroporated cells exhibited similar migration defects without a decrease in cell number (Figure 1A). To elucidate the important roles of endocytosis in neuronal migration, we next applied a DN-Rab5 (S34N) (Rosenfeld et al., 2001Rosenfeld J.L. Moore R.H. Zimmer K.P. Alpizar-Foster E. Dai W. Zarka M.N. Knoll B.J. Lysosome proteins are redistributed during expression of a GTP-hydrolysis-defective rab5a.J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 4499-4508Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Expression of DN-Rab5 in primary cortical neurons delayed the endocytosis of Alexa594-conjugated transferrin (Figure S1F), suggesting that DN-Rab5 efficiently suppressed endocytosis in cortical neurons. The DN-Rab5-expressing vector was electroporated into E14 cerebral cortices, followed by fixation at P0. In contrast to control cells, many DN-Rab5-expressing cells were found stalled near the border between the intermediate zone and cortical plate (Figures 1A and S1B). Some of DN-Rab5-expressing cells had abnormal morphologies, including a disorganized leading process or round morphology at E17 (Figures S1C and S1D). To confirm these results, we performed RNA interference (RNAi) experiments. Two short hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) for Rab5-expressing vectors effectively reduced the amount of endogenous Rab5 when transfected to primary cortical neurons (Figure 1F). These RNAi vectors were electroporated into E14 cerebral cortices. At P0, control scrambled (nontargeting) shRNA-expressing cells migrated normally to the superficial layer of the cortical plate, but Rab5-knockdown cells exhibited neuronal migration defects (Figure 1B). This migration defect was rescued by the coexpression of human wild-type Rab5 (wt-Rab5) with the Rab5-knockdown vector (Figure 1B). Similar to DN-Rab5-expressing cells, many Rab5-knockdown cells were stalled near the border between the intermediate zone and cortical plate, suggesting that Rab5-dependent endocytosis is required for entering the cortical plate. Since migrating neurons exhibit various morphologies in the intermediate zone and these morphological changes may be associated with neuronal maturation and neurological disorders, we next analyzed the morphology of the Rab5-knockdown cells. Consistent with previous reports (Kawauchi and Hoshino, 2008Kawauchi T. Hoshino M. Molecular pathways regulating cytoskeletal organization and morphological changes in migrating neurons.Dev. Neurosci. 2008; 30: 36-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), control migrating neurons exhibited multipolar morphology in the lower part of the intermediate zone and bipolar shape with a leading process in the cortical plate and the upper part of the intermediate zone (Figure 1C). In contrast, some Rab5-knockdown locomoting neurons displayed increased leading process branches (small arrowheads in Figure 1C; Figure 1D, p < 0.02, t test) or had abnormally thick trailing process (arrow in Figure 1C). Furthermore, Rab5-knockdown cells displayed a somewhat round morphology in the lower part of the intermediate zone (large arrowheads in Figure 1C). The ratio of multipolar cells was decreased significantly (p < 0.02, t test) and that of the round cells was increased in Rab5-shRNA-electroporated cortices (p < 0.01, t test), compared with control cortices (Figure 1E). Rab5-knockdown cells expressed a neuronal marker, Hu protein, suggesting that the abnormal morphology and migration were not due to a defect in neuronal differentiation (Figure 1G). In addition, in the ventricular zone, where most of the cells are neural progenitors, no significant differences in the staining for proliferative markers, phospho-Histone H3 (PH3) (M phase) and Ki67 (late G1, S, G2, and M, but not G0, phases) were found between control and Rab5-shRNA-electroporated cortices at 1 day after electroporation (E15) (Figure S2B). To further confirm that the migration defects of Rab5-suppressing cells are not due to the defects in radial glia (neural progenitors), we constructed a neuron-specific Tα1 (α1-tubulin) promoter-driven DN-Rab5 vector to replace the ubiquitously expressed CAG promoter (Gloster et al., 1994Gloster A. Wu W. Speelman A. Weiss S. Causing C. Pozniak C. Reynolds B. Chang E. Toma J.G. Miller F.D. The T alpha 1 alpha-tubulin promoter specifies gene expression as a function of neuronal growth and regeneration in transgenic mice.J. Neurosci. 1994; 14: 7319-7330Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). First, the Tα1-EGFP-expressing vector was coelectroporated with CAG-DsRed-expressing vector to estimate the strength of the promoter activity. At 3 days after electroporation (E17), no significant signals of EGFP were detected in the VZ as expected. In migrating neurons, EGFP expression levels were quite low, compared with DsRed (Figure S1E), although coelectroporation with CAG-EGFP and CAG-DsRed induced strong expression of both EGFP and DsRed (Kawauchi et al., 2003Kawauchi T. Chihama K. Nabeshima Y. Hoshino M. The in vivo roles of STEF/Tiam1, Rac1 and JNK in cortical neuronal migration.EMBO J. 2003; 22: 4190-4201Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar), suggesting that Tα1 promoter activity is very low. Consistent with this, when a high concentration of Tα1-DN-Rab5-expressing vector was coelectroporated with CAG-EGFP at E14, strongly transfected cells, but not EGFP-weak positive cells, showed migration defects similar to CAG-DN-Rab5 (Figure 1A), suggesting that the functions of Rab5 in postmitotic neurons are required for proper neuronal migration. We next electroporated Tα1-DN-Dyn-K44A into E14 cortices, but many EGFP-positive cells disappeared at P0. These results indicated that endocytosis plays important roles in neuronal migration and morphological changes, in addition to basic cellular functions, such as cell survival that was disturbed by DN-Dyn-K44A. We next analyzed how Rab5-dependent endocytosis regulates neuronal migration. One possibility is that abnormal morphologies lead to the migration defects. A leading process with no or few branches is thought to be important for neuronal migration (Guerrier et al., 2009Guerrier S. Coutinho-Budd J. Sassa T. Gresset A. Jordan N.V. Chen K. Jin W.L. Frost A. Polleux F.

Mode of cell migration to the superficial layers of fetal monkey neocortex.J. Comp. Neurol. 1972; 145: 61-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (1619) Google Scholar). However, statistical analysis revealed that only about 30% of Rab5-knockdown neurons exhibited an abnormal morphology although the migration defects were present in the majority (Figures 1B–1E). Therefore, we further analyzed the downstream effects of Rab5-dependent endocytosis. It is known that Rab5 regulates both endocytosis and early endosome formation. From the early endosome (also called “sorting endosome”), there are many trafficking pathways, including recycling and lysosomal degradation pathways, each of which is regulated by a different subtype of Rab family protein (Figure 2H ) (Pfeffer, 2001Pfeffer S.R. Rab GTPases: specifying and deciphering organelle identity and function.Trends Cell Biol. 2001; 11: 487-491Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar, Stenmark and Olkkonen, 2001Stenmark H.

Rab proteins as membrane organizers.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 2: 107-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (2592) Google Scholar). Therefore, we perturbed each membrane trafficking pathway from the early endosome by means of in vivo functional suppression of Rab4 (fast recycling pathway), Rab11 (slow recycling pathway via recycling endosome), Rab7 (lysosomal degradation pathway), and Rab9 (retrograde transport to Golgi apparatus via late endosome). Dominant-negative forms for these Rab proteins were expressed in migrating neurons by using in utero electroporation at E14. At P0, introduction of DN-Rab4 (S22N), Rab7 (T22N), and Rab9 (S21N) did not have much effect on the migration of the locomoting neurons (Figures 2A, 2C, and 2D; data not shown), although the position of DN-Rab7-expressing cells was slightly but significantly lower than that of control (Figures 2C and 7A–7C). In contrast, the expression of DN-Rab11 (S25N) significantly delayed neuronal migration in vivo (Figure 2B). Consistently, shRNA for Rab11, which efficiently reduced the protein level of endogenous Rab11 (Figure 2E), suppressed neuronal migration in the cortical plate (Figure 2F), but did not affect the expression of a neuronal marker, Hu protein (Figure 2G). In addition, the morphologies of radial glial fibers were not affected in both Rab11- and Rab5-shRNAs-electroporated cortices (Figure S2A). Coexpression of human wt-Rab11 with Rab11-shRNA restored neuronal positioning in the cortical plate (Figure 2F), suggesting that a Rab11-dependent recycling pathway is required for cortical neuronal migration. We next tried to identify the molecular cargo that is transported by the Rab5- and Rab11-dependent pathways. Although about 30% of Rab5-knockdown cells exhibited abnormal morphologies at 3 days after electroporation, many Rab5-knockdown cells formed a leading process. These cells seemed to attach to the radial glial fibers because their leading processes and radial glial fibers were intertwined (Figure 3A ), but they could not migrate into the cortical plate (Figure 1B). Together with the observation that abnormally thick trailing processes of Rab5-knockdown cells also seemed to attach to the radial glial fibers (Figure 3A), this suggested that Rab5 suppression affects the cell adhesion between migrating neurons and radial glia, resulting in difficulty in detaching from the radial glial fiber at the cell rear. To test this possibility, we performed a previously reported in vitro neuron-radial glia interaction assay (Gongidi et al., 2004Gongidi V. Ring C. Moody M. Brekken R. Sage E.H. Rakic P. Anton E.S. SPARC-like 1 regulates the terminal phase of radial glia-guided migration in the cerebral cortex.Neuron. 2004; 41: 57-69Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) with some modifications. First, E15 cerebral cortices were dissociated and cultured in MEM (minimum essential medium) containing 10% horse serum. After a 7 day culture with two passages, F-actin-strong positive cells with fibroblast-like or elongated morphology were concentrated, and these cells expressed a radial glial marker, Nestin, but not a neuronal marker, Tuj1 (arrowheads in Figure 3B). Subsequently, primary cortical neurons transfected with Rab5-shRNA or control shRNA plus EGFP-expressing vectors were added to the Nestin-positive cells and co-cultured for 2 days. Almost all EGFP-positive cells were neurons as indicated by being Tuj1-positive and Nestin-negative (arrows in Figures 3B and S3A). EGFP-positive control neurons extended their processes along Nestin-positive cells, suggesting that adhesion molecule(s) may connect these cells (Figures 3C and S3A). Rab5-knockdown neurons also interacted with Nestin-positive cells, but they actively extended, branched and entangled their processes only when they attached to Nestin-positive cells (Figures 3C, S3A, and S3B). The length of the longest primary neurites overlapping with Nestin-positive cells was significantly increased, but total length of the longest primary neurites was not changed, compared with that of control (Figures 3D, 3E, and S3C). These data suggest that suppression of Rab5-dependent endocytosis promotes the cell adhesion between neurons and Nestin-positive cells. Cadherins and integrins are two major families of adhesion molecules. Both N-cadherin and β1-integrin were expressed in primary cortical neurons (Figure S4A). N-cadherin was observed to be localized near the plasma membrane and cytoplasmic punctuate structures, partially colocalizing with an early endosome marker, EEA1, and recycling endosome marker, Rab11, in primary cortical neurons (Figures S4B and S4C). In contrast, β1-integrin was partially colocalized with EEA1, but barely with Rab11 (Figures S4B and S4C). We next analyzed the cell surface expression levels of these adhesion molecules in Rab5-knockdown cells by the use of fluorescence-activated cell sorter (FACS). Primary cortical neurons transfected with Rab5-shRNA or control shRNA plus EGFP-expressing vectors were treated with anti-N-cadherin or β1-integrin antibody and subjected to FACS analysis to examine the cell surface expression levels of these proteins on EGFP-positive cells. Knockdown of Rab5 resulted in about 10% increase of the surface levels of N-cadherin, but did not affect that of β1-integrin (Figure 4A ) (the ratio of surface N-cadherin in Rab5-knockdown cells to that of control was 1.09 ± 0.03; p < 0.02, t test). Although dissociated neurons barely migrate, they change their morphologies and elongate neurites, suggesting that cell surface adhesion molecules may actively be transported. Cell surface staining for N-cadherin using nonpermeabilized cortical neurons showed that the distribution of surface N-cadherin was gradually increased along neuronal processes in control cells (Figures 4B and 4C). Surface N-cadherin levels at distal or proximal regions of neuronal processes were higher than those of proximal regions or cell bodies, respectively (distal versus proximal: p < 0.01, proximal versus cell bodies: p < 0.001, t test, n = 52 cells). In contrast, surface N-cadherin levels at proximal and distal regions of neuronal processes were not significantly changed in Rab5-knockdown neurons (p > 0.1, t test, n = 54 cells) (Figures 4B and 4C). These in vitro data suggest that Rab5 regulates cell adhesion and surface distribution of N-cadherin in primary cortical neurons. Immunohistochemical analyses showed that N-cadherin was expressed throughout cerebral cortex at E17 and found in both migrating neurons and radial glial fibers (Figures 4D, 4E, and S4D). Since our in vitro results showed that Rab5 suppression slightly increased surface levels of N-cadherin, we examined whether weak in vivo knockdown of N-cadherin can rescue the Rab5-knockdown phenotypes or not. When low concentrations (0.5 μg/μl) of shRNA for N-cadherin (NC-sh1023, see Figure 6B) were coelectroporated, the migration defects of Rab5-knockdown cells were partially restored (Figure 4F).

Rothstein J.D. From Charcot to Lou Gehrig: deciphering selective motor neuron death in ALS.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2001; 2: 806-819Crossref PubMed Scopus (1128) Google Scholar). The typical age of onset is between 50 to 60 years, followed by paralysis and ultimately death within 2–5 years after onset (Mulder et al., 1986Mulder D.W. Kurland L.T. Offord K.P. Beard C.M. Familial adult motor neuron disease: amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.Neurology. 1986; 36: 511-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). Most instances of ALS are sporadic lacking any apparent genetic linkage, but 10% are inherited in a dominant manner. Twenty percent of these familial cases have been attributed to mutations in the gene encoding cytoplasmic Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase (SOD1) (Rosen et al., 1993Rosen D.R. Siddique T. Patterson D. Figlewicz D.A. Sapp P. Hentati A. Donaldson D. Goto J. O'Regan J.P.

Although multiple hypotheses have been proposed to explain mutant SOD1-mediated toxicity (Ilieva et al., 2009Ilieva H. Polymenidou M. Cleveland D.W.

USA. 2008; 105: 4022-4027Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). Sensitivity to proteolysis and immunoprecipitation with an antibody specific for misfolded SOD1 further indicated that misfolded forms of dismutase active and inactive SOD1 are deposited onto the cytoplasmic face of the outer membrane of spinal cord mitochondria (Vande Velde et al., 2008Vande Velde C. Miller T.M. Cashman N.R. Cleveland D.W. Selective association of misfolded ALS-linked mutant SOD1 with the cytoplasmic face of mitochondria.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

This is accompanied by altered accumulated levels of a few mitochondrial proteins, reduced import of multiple mitochondrial proteins, and reduced complex I activity (T. Miller, C. Vande Velde, and D.W.C., unpublished data). Oxidative phosphorylation requires the transport of metabolites, including ADP, ATP, and inorganic phosphate across both mitochondrial membranes. Located in the outer mitochondrial membrane, the voltage-dependent anion channel (VDAC), known as mitochondrial porin, assumes a crucial position in the cell, controlling metabolic cross-talk between the mitochondrion and the rest of the cell, thus regulating the metabolic and energetic functions of mitochondria (Shoshan-Barmatz et al., 2006Shoshan-Barmatz V. Israelson A. Brdiczka D. Sheu S.S. The voltage-dependent anion channel (VDAC): function in intracellular signalling, cell life and cell death.Curr. Pharm.

Uncovering the role of VDAC in the regulation of cell life and death.J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 2008; 40: 183-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Of the three VDAC isoforms (VDAC1–3), VDAC1 is the most abundant in most cells. VDAC1 is a primary contributor to ATP/ADP flux across the outer mitochondrial membrane (Colombini, 2004Colombini M.

Initially named somewhat misleadingly as a channel for anions, it is also responsible for import/export of Ca2+ (Gincel et al., 2001Gincel D. Zaid H. Shoshan-Barmatz V.

Regulation of metabolite flux through voltage-gating of VDAC channels.J. Membr. Biol. 1997; 157: 271-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). Indeed, it has been demonstrated that silencing VDAC1 expression in a cultured cell line using shRNA resulted in reduced ATP production and a decrease in cell growth (Abu-Hamad et al., 2006Abu-Hamad S. Sivan S. Shoshan-Barmatz V. The expression level of the voltage-dependent anion channel controls life and death of the cell.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2006; 103: 5787-5792Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). VDAC1 is also a key player in mitochondria-mediated apoptosis. VDAC1 has been implicated in apoptotic-relevant events, due to serving as the target for members of the pro- and anti-apoptotic Bcl2-family of proteins (Arbel and Shoshan-Barmatz, 2010Arbel N. Shoshan-Barmatz V. Voltage-dependent anion channel 1-based peptides interact with Bcl-2 to prevent antiapoptotic activity.J. Biol.

VDAC1 has also been implicated in Parkinson's disease as a direct target for Parkin-mediated poly-ubiquitylation and mitophagy (Geisler et al., 2010Geisler S. Holmström K.M. Skujat D. Fiesel F.C. Rothfuss O.C. Kahle P.J. Springer W. PINK1/Parkin-mediated mitophagy is dependent on VDAC1 and p62/SQSTM1.Nat. Cell Biol. 2010; 12: 119-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (1766) Google Scholar). Starting from recognition that a proportion of misfolded, mutant SOD1 is bound to the cytoplasmic face of the outer membrane of mitochondria in affected tissues (Liu et al., 2004Liu J. Lillo C.

Selective association of misfolded ALS-linked mutant SOD1 with the cytoplasmic face of mitochondria.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2008; 105: 4022-4027Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar), we now identify damage to spinal cord mitochondria to arise through direct binding of misfolded SOD1 onto the cytoplasmic-facing domain of VDAC1, thereby inhibiting its conductance. To investigate potential interactions between mutant SOD1 and VDAC1, mitochondria from rats expressing wild-type human SOD1 (hSOD1wt) or either of two different ALS-linked SOD1 mutants, a dismutase active hSOD1G93A and a dismutase inactive hSOD1H46R, were highly purified by repeated centrifugation steps (summarized in Figure 1A ) including a final density gradient flotation step to eliminate any contaminating protein only aggregates (proteins sediment downward in these conditions because of their higher density), as previously described (Vande Velde et al., 2008Vande Velde C. Miller T.M. Cashman N.R. Cleveland D.W. Selective association of misfolded ALS-linked mutant SOD1 with the cytoplasmic face of mitochondria.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2008; 105: 4022-4027Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). Immunoblotting of immunoprecipitates generated after addition of an SOD1 antibody to solubilized mitochondrial lysates revealed that a proportion of VDAC1 was coprecipitated with dismutase active and inactive mutant SOD1, but not wild-type SOD1 (Figure 1B). Parallel immunoprecipitations with a VDAC1 antibody confirmed coprecipitation of both hSOD1G93A and hSOD1H46R with VDAC1 (Figure 1D). Binding to VDAC1 was a property only of spinal cord mitochondria, as no association of mutant SOD1 was seen with purified brain mitochondria from the same animals using immunoprecipitation with SOD1 (Figure 1C) or VDAC1 (Figure 1E) antibodies. This latter finding is consistent with prior efforts that had demonstrated that mutant SOD1 associates with the cytoplasmic face of the outer membrane of mitochondria in spinal cord, but not other tissue types (Liu et al., 2004Liu J. Lillo C. Jonsson P.A. Vande Velde C. Ward C.M. Miller T.M. Subramaniam J.R. Rothstein J.D. Marklund S.

Moreover, mutant SOD1 binding to VDAC1 is inversely correlated with the level of hexokinase-I, a known partner that binds to VDAC1 exposed on the cytoplasmic mitochondrial surface (Abu-Hamad et al., 2008Abu-Hamad S.

To test the nature of the interaction between mutant SOD1 and VDAC1, immunoprecipitation was performed with a SOD1 antibody that recognizes a “disease-specific epitope” (DSE) that is unavailable on correctly folded SOD1 (Cashman and Caughey, 2004Cashman N.R.

Med. 2007; 13: 754-759Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Using one such antibody (DSE2), age-dependent deposition of mutant SOD1 onto the cytoplasmic face of spinal cord mitochondria has been shown to reflect association of misfolded SOD1 (Vande Velde et al., 2008Vande Velde C. Miller T.M. Cashman N.R. Cleveland D.W. Selective association of misfolded ALS-linked mutant SOD1 with the cytoplasmic face of mitochondria.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2008; 105: 4022-4027Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). We exploited this antibody to examine if the SOD1 associated with VDAC1 is bound through misfolded SOD1. Liver, brain, and spinal cord cytosolic and mitochondrial fractions purified from symptomatic rats expressing mutant hSOD1G93A were immunoprecipitated (see schematic in Figure 2A ) with the DSE2 antibody, which recognizes an epitope in the electrostatic loop of hSOD1 (between residues 125–142) that is buried in normally folded SOD1. Misfolded mutant SOD1G93A was not detectable in the soluble fraction of any tissue, but was immunoprecipitated from the spinal cord, but not liver or brain, mitochondrial fractions (Figure 2B). Solubilized spinal cord mitochondria purified from presymptomatic and symptomatic rats expressing either of two different SOD1 mutants, dismutase active hSOD1G93A and dismutase inactive hSOD1H46R, as well as hSOD1wt were immunoprecipitated with the DSE2 antibody and coimmunoprecipitated components identified by immunoblotting. An age-dependent increase in misfolded SOD1 was seen for both mutants, with a significantly higher proportion of the dismutase inactive SOD1H46R in a misfolded conformation. In samples from symptomatic animals, VDAC1 coprecipitated together with the misfolded mutant SOD1, as revealed by immunoblotting of immunoprecipitates (Figure 2C). This association was selective for VDAC1, as misfolded mutant SOD1 did not coimmunoprecipitate with any of three other mitochondrial proteins examined (Figure 2C), including two additional outer mitochondrial membrane proteins with domains facing the cytoplasm: TOM40, the 40 kDa component of transport across the outer membrane (TOM) complex mediating all protein import from the cytoplasm to the mitochondria, and VDAC2, a second voltage-dependent anion channel isoform that has been estimated to represent 7% (kidney) to 25% (brain) of accumulated VDAC (Yamamoto et al., 2006Yamamoto T. Yamada A. Watanabe M. Yoshimura Y. Yamazaki N. Yoshimura Y. Yamauchi T. Kataoka M. Nagata T. Terada H. Shinohara Y. VDAC1, having a shorter N-terminus than VDAC2 but showing the same migration in an SDS-polyacrylamide gel, is the predominant form expressed in mitochondria of various tissues.J. Proteome Res. 2006; 5: 3336-3344Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). It also did not coprecipitate cyclophilin-D, an important component of the permeability transition pore. Furthermore, in order to determine which cells accumulate the misfolded form of SOD1, we performed immunostaining using the DSE2 antibody. Spinal cords from loxSOD1G37R mice at different stages of the disease were subjected to immunostaining with DSE2 antibody (Figure 2D). The accumulation of misfolded SOD1 dramatically increased with disease progression. Although little accumulation of misfolded SOD1 is found by disease onset, it was preferentially found within motor neurons. During disease progression, a dramatic increase of misfolded SOD1 was apparently accumulated in other cells as well and probably also extracellularly. Throughout disease a proportion of the misfolded SOD1 was colocalized with mitochondria of motor neurons and other cells, starting at onset and increasing with disease progression (Figure 2D). To test if binding of mutant SOD1 affects VDAC1 function, VDAC1 was purified from spinal cords of nontransgenic rats (Figure 3A ) and reconstituted into a planar lipid bilayer (Figure 3A) using conditions previously demonstrated to yield polarized VDAC1 membrane insertion such that the VDAC1 surface exposed on the cis side is the surface exposed to the cytosol when inserted into the mitochondrial outer membrane (Azoulay-Zohar et al., 2004Azoulay-Zohar H.

In these regions, protein phosphatase 1 (PP1), the activity state of which is indirectly controlled by calcium/calmodulin-activated protein phosphatase 2B (calcineurin or PP2B), has been suggested to act in concert with the α isoform of calcium/calmodulin-dependent kinase II (αCaMKII) to provide a molecular switch regulating the phosphorylation state of AMPA receptors (Lisman and Zhabotinsky, 2001Lisman J.E.

Interestingly, changes in LTD and LTP induction can be associated with changes in intrinsic excitability in the hippocampus and cerebellum (Armano et al., 2000Armano S. Rossi P. Taglietti V.

Thus, cerebellar Purkinje cells operate in general inversely to their hippocampal counterparts in that downstream kinase and phosphatase activity can push the balance toward LTD and LTP, respectively (Coesmans et al., 2004Coesmans M.

Some of these studies have encouraged scientists to hypothesize that LTD is specifically responsible for gain increases in VOR adaptation (Boyden and Raymond, 2003Boyden E.S. Raymond J.L. Active reversal of motor memories reveals rules governing memory encoding.Neuron. 2003; 39: 1031-1042Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) and acquisition of conditioned eyeblink responses (De Zeeuw and Yeo, 2005De Zeeuw C.I.

Raymond J.L. Active reversal of motor memories reveals rules governing memory encoding.Neuron. 2003; 39: 1031-1042Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). However, no transgenic mouse mutants have been created yet that allow us to investigate specifically the possible contribution of potentiation in Purkinje cells. Since calcineurin is required for PF-PC LTP and increases in intrinsic excitability (Belmeguenai and Hansel, 2005Belmeguenai A. Hansel C. A role for protein phosphatases 1, 2A, and 2B in cerebellar long-term potentiation.J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 10768-10772Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar; and personal communication), this protein forms an ideal molecular target to genetically manipulate potentiation in Purkinje cells and to investigate a potential role of potentiation in cerebellar motor learning. Thus, here we created mutant mice (L7-PP2B), in which calcineurin activity is selectively impaired in Purkinje cells by crossing floxed CNB1 mice (regulatory subunit of calcineurin) (Zeng et al., 2001Zeng H. Chattarji S. Barbarosie M. Rondi-Reig L. Philpot B.D. Miyakawa T. Bear M.F. Tonegawa S. Forebrain-specific calcineurin knockout selectively impairs bidirectional synaptic plasticity and working/episodic-like memory.Cell. 2001; 107: 617-629Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar) with a Purkinje cell-specific (L7-)cre-line (Barski et al., 2000Barski J.J. Dethleffsen K. Meyer M. Cre recombinase expression in cerebellar Purkinje cells.Genesis. 2000; 28: 93-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar; Figure 1A ), and we subsequently investigated them at the cell physiological and behavioral level. Immunocytochemical analysis of the L7-PP2B mice with antibodies directed against the CNB1 subunit showed that calcineurin is indeed specifically deleted in Purkinje cells (Figure 1B). Density analyses showed that PP2B staining intensity was significantly lower in Purkinje cell bodies and primary dendrites (p = 0.003 and 0.034, respectively; t test), but not in granule cells or the neuropil of the molecular layer (p > 0.6 for both parameters). Thionine and Golgi stainings revealed that the mutation did not affect the foliation of the cerebellar cortex or the cyto-architecture of Purkinje cells, respectively (Figure 1C). Moreover, electron microscopic examinations of calbindin-stained sections of the cerebellar cortex of L7-PP2B mice showed that the number and size of synaptic inputs from PFs onto Purkinje cells were not significantly different from those of littermate controls (p > 0.26 for all parameters, i.e., PSD length, PSD area, and density of synapses; t test) (Figure 1D). Moreover, the area covered by the Purkinje cell dendrites as well as the thickness of the different layers of the cerebellar cortex was also unaffected (p > 0.49 for both parameters; t test). As predicted by our previous pharmacological in vitro studies in cerebellar rat tissue (Belmeguenai and Hansel, 2005Belmeguenai A. Hansel C. A role for protein phosphatases 1, 2A, and 2B in cerebellar long-term potentiation.J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 10768-10772Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar), our cell physiological examination of 10- to 24-week-old L7-PP2B mice indeed showed that LTP induction following parallel fiber stimulation alone was blocked (p = 0.027; t test) (Figure 2A ). In contrast, LTD induction following paired PF and climbing fiber (CF) stimulation was unaffected in adult L7-PP2B mice (p = 0.96; t test) (Figure 2C). In wild-type littermates, both LTP and LTD were successfully induced (Figures 2A and 2C). The inability of L7-PP2B mutants to potentiate their parallel fiber input did not depend on the temperature, age, or type of induction protocol, while it could be rescued by the addition of active PP2B (Figures S1 and S2). Moreover, EPSPs and intracellular calcium concentrations during the tetanus did not differ (Figure 2B), arguing against the possibility that these factors were responsible for the observed deletion of parallel fiber potentiation. Since the presence or absence of CF activity is critical for the induction of depression and potentiation in Purkinje cells, respectively (Coesmans et al., 2004Coesmans M. Weber J.T. De Zeeuw C.I. Hansel C. Bidirectional parallel fiber plasticity in the cerebellum under climbing fiber control.Neuron. 2004; 44: 691-700Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar, Lev-Ram et al., 2002Lev-Ram V.

USA. 2002; 99: 8389-8393Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar), we also examined whether deletion of calcineurin in Purkinje cells directly affects the developmental elimination of surplus CF inputs, as previously observed for mutant mice lacking PKC (De Zeeuw et al., 1998De Zeeuw C.I. Hansel C. Bian F. Koekkoek S.K. van Alphen A.M. Linden D.J. Oberdick J.

Belmeguenai A. Houtman S.H. Buitendijk G.H. Andreev D. De Zeeuw C.I. Elgersma Y. alphaCaMKII Is essential for cerebellar LTD and motor learning.Neuron. 2006; 51: 835-843Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). CF elimination in adult L7-PP2B mice (10–24 weeks), however, appeared normal, and is therefore unlikely to have affected synaptic input patterns that could indirectly impair plasticity in Purkinje cells of L7-PP2B mice (Figure 3A ). Likewise, we did not detect differences in the paired-pulse depression (PPD) ratio at CF synapses and the paired-pulse facilitation (PPF) ratio at PF synapses, respectively (Figures 3B and 3C). In fact, even in the presence of NBQX or lower extracellular calcium the PPF did not differ (Figure 3C). These findings suggest that the observed effects on plasticity were postsynaptic, but they don't allow us to conclude that presynaptic changes were completely absent. Finally, we found no differences in frequency, amplitude, rise/decay time, or half-width of spontaneous IPSCs in Purkinje cells (Figure 3D). Together, these data suggest that the basic synaptic transmission of both excitatory and inhibitory inputs to Purkinje cells is unaffected in L7-PP2B mice. In addition to synaptic parallel fiber potentiation, nonsynaptic Purkinje cell intrinsic excitability also can be potentiated. This intrinsic potentiation could be readily induced in wild-types, but not in the L7-PP2B mutants (p = 0.007; ANOVA for repeated measurements) (Figure 4A ). Notably, we also observed differences in baseline intrinsic excitability. Linear fits of the current-frequency curves showed that the slope of L7-PP2B mice is less steep (p = 0.002; t test) (Figure 4B). This difference suggests that the cells are less excitable, which is confirmed by a lower maximum firing frequency (p < 0.001; t test) (Table S1). To test whether the deficits in PF-PC LTP and plasticity of intrinsic excitability affect Purkinje cell activity in vivo, we performed extracellular recordings in awake mice (n = 25 versus 30 for control versus L7-PP2B). Firing frequencies of simple spikes and complex spikes were both normal (p = 0.94 and p = 0.54, respectively; t test), but the intersimple spike interval distribution was sharper with less high-frequency spiking and concomitant higher regularity in L7-PP2B mutants (Figure 4C). Thus, the changes in intrinsic excitability and potentiation in L7-PP2B mice correlate with a loss of high-frequency simple spike activity, but do not alter the average firing frequency of Purkinje cells. We therefore conclude that the deficits in potentiation in the L7-PP2B mice may selectively affect their spatiotemporal firing patterns of simple spike activities. In the open field or during footprint analysis, L7-PP2B mice did not show obvious signs of ataxia (Figure S3). To explore their specific capabilities for cerebellar motor learning, we first subjected the mice to compensatory eye-movement tests, in particular VOR adaptation tests, which are controlled by the vestibulocerebellum (De Zeeuw et al., 1998De Zeeuw C.I.

Measurements of basic performance parameters including the gain (amplitude) and phase (timing) of the optokinetic reflex (OKR) and/or VOR showed overall that the motor performance of the L7-PP2B mutants was moderately, but significantly, affected (Figures 5B–5D and S4A–S4C). For OKR and VVOR, the gain values of L7-PP2B mutants were significantly lower than those wild-type littermates (both OKR and VVOR p < 0.001; ANOVA for repeated measurements) (Figures 5B and 5C), while their phase values were significantly lagging those of the wild-types (OKR p < 0.01; VVOR p < 0.001; ANOVA for repeated measurements). In contrast, for VOR the gain of L7-PP2B mutants was significantly greater than that of wild-type littermates (p < 0.001; ANOVA for repeated measurements) (Figure 5D), while their phase values were also significantly lagging those of the wild-types (p < 0.01; ANOVA for repeated measurements) (Figure S4). The differences among mutants and wild-types during OKR and VVOR were not caused by differences in vision itself, because the latencies of the eye movement responses to the onset of the optokinetic stimuli were unaffected in the mutants (p = 0.55, ANOVA for repeated measurements) (Figure S5). A prominent phenotype of the L7-PP2B mice was observed when we subjected the animals to the mismatch learning paradigms. In a 2-day visuovestibular training paradigm aimed at reducing the gain of the VOR, learning was significantly impaired in the mutants (Figure 5E) (p < 0.0002 for both days; ANOVA for repeated measurements). In the opposite training paradigm, which was aimed at increasing the gain, the gain values of the mutants even showed a decrease (Figure 5F; comparison among mutants and controls p < 0.000001 for both days, ANOVA for repeated measurements). Control experiments revealed that this decrease was not due to aspecific effects, because exposure to a normal, nontraining paradigm for the same duration did not result in any decrease (p = 0.83 and p = 0.90 for day 1 and day 2, respectively, ANOVA for repeated measurements) (Figure 5G). Phase changes are minimal during these gain adaptation paradigms (Figures S4D–S4F), but phase, like gain, can also be adapted. In this respect, the ability of the mutants to learn was affected in such a profound way that they were completely unable to adapt their phase during a long-term 5-day phase reversal training paradigm (Figure 5H). In contrast, wild-type littermates were able to reverse their phase toward 180 degrees in five consecutive training sessions (fifth day, comparison among L7-PP2B mutants and wild-type mice; p < 0.000001, ANOVA for repeated measurements). Thus, the Purkinje cell-specific PP2B knockout mice were moderately affected in the performance of their basic compensatory eye movements and markedly affected in all forms of VOR adaptation tested. Next, to find out whether the learning deficits in the L7-PP2B mutants are limited to abnormalities in VOR adaptation, which is controlled by the vestibulocerebellum, or whether they reflect a more global deficit in cerebellar motor learning, we also subjected them to a training paradigm that is controlled by a different region of the cerebellum: classical conditioning of eyeblink responses, which in mice is controlled by lobulus simplex in the hemisphere and lobule VI in the vermis (Van Der Giessen et al., 2008Van Der Giessen R.S. Koekkoek S.K. van Dorp S. De Gruijl J.R. Cupido A. Khosrovani S. Dortland B. Wellershaus K. Degen J.

The eyeblink responses of the mice were conditioned using a tone and an air puff as the conditioned stimulus (CS) and unconditioned stimulus (US), respectively (Koekkoek et al., 2003Koekkoek S.K. Hulscher H.C. Dortland B.R. Hensbroek R.A. Elgersma Y. Ruigrok T.J. De Zeeuw C.I. Cerebellar LTD and learning-dependent timing of conditioned eyelid responses.Science. 2003; 301: 1736-1739Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). After four paired training sessions (T-1 to T-4), the L7-PP2B mutants showed significantly less conditioned responses than their wild-type littermates (comparison between L7-PP2B mice and wild-type littermates at T4: p < 0.05, t test), while this difference was absent during the first training session (at T1: p = 0.82, t test) (Figures 6B and 6C). In fact, the L7-PP2B mutant mice did not show any significant change in percentage of conditioned eyeblink responses over consecutive days of training (e.g., T4 versus T1, p = 0.52; one way within subjects ANOVA). The timing of the conditioned responses in the mutants was also affected in that the average peak latency of their CS-alone responses at T4 was significantly shorter (p < 0.02; t test) than that of controls (Figure 6C; for peaks in paired trials, see also Figure 6B). In contrast, the kinetics of the unconditioned eyeblink responses in the L7-PP2B mutants were indistinguishable (p > 0.4 for onset, peak amplitude as well as velocity of UR; t test) from those in controls (Figure 6D). Thus, our eyeblink tests showed that the L7-PP2B mice have a specific impairment in their conditioned responses rather than a general deficit in the motor component of all their eyeblink responses. Together with the VOR gain adaptation tests, we conclude that the L7-PP2B mutants have severe deficits in hallmark features of cerebellar learning functions: the fine-tuning of sensorimotor gains and the fast adaptation of motor output in response to changing behavioral needs.

In Drosophila olfactory receptor neurons (ORNs), DEET is detected through a mechanism employing the olfactory receptor, OR83b. However, it is controversial as to whether ORNs respond directly to DEET or whether DEET blocks the response to attractive odors. Here, we showed that DEET suppressed feeding behavior in Drosophila, and this effect was mediated by gustatory receptor neurons (GRNs). DEET was potent in suppressing feeding as <0.1% DEET elicited aversive behavior. Inhibition of feeding required multiple gustatory receptors (GRs) expressed in inhibitory GRNs. DEET stimulated action potentials in GRNs that respond to aversive compounds, and this response was lost in the Gr32a, Gr33a, and Gr66a mutants. Since 0.02% DEET elicited action potentials, we conclude that DEET directly activates of GRNs. We suggest that the effectiveness of DEET in pest control owes to its dual action in inducing avoidance simultaneously via GRNs and ORNs. DEET is the most widely used insect repellent worldwide.

Fruit flies are exquisitely sensitive to avoiding DEET through the sense of taste Gustatory receptors are required for detecting DEET in gustatory receptor neurons Minute quantities of DEET directly activate gustatory receptor neurons Insect pests are among the most serious causes of disease and starvation. Disease-transmitting insect vectors such as mosquitoes, biting flies, chiggers, fleas, and ticks spread infections to hundreds of millions of people each year. Malaria alone afflicts at least half a billion people annually, and this high incidence is due to the efficient transfer of the Plasmodium parasite by the mosquito, Anopheles gambiae (Snow et al., 2005Snow R.W. Guerra C.A. Noor A.M. Myint H.Y. Hay S.I. The global distribution of clinical episodes of Plasmodium falciparum malaria.Nature. 2005; 434: 214-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (2088) Google Scholar). Insect pests also have devastating effects on crops and contribute to food shortages and famines. Approximately fourteen percent of all crops are lost to insect destruction, resulting in economic losses estimated at $200 billion/year in the United States and $2 trillion worldwide (Pimentel, 2009Pimentel D. Pesticides and pest control.in: Peshin R. Dhawan A.K. Integrated Pest Management: Innovation-Development Process. Springer, New York2009: 83-87Crossref Scopus (102) Google Scholar). A common strategy to control insect pests is to repel them. Volatile insect repellents are detected through the olfactory sense and can be applied directly to human skin and clothing to ward off mosquitoes and other disease vectors. Nonvolatile repellents are typically sprayed on crops and are detected by insects through the sense of taste. Given that these latter repellents elicit a repulsive behavior, they inhibit the insect's urge to consume the crops and are therefore referred to as antifeedants. Most plants produce antifeedants to reduce feeding (van der Goes van Naters and Carlson, 2006van der Goes van Naters W. Carlson J.R. Insects as chemosensors of humans and crops.Nature. 2006; 444: 302-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar), and these compounds typically have insecticidal properties if they are ingested. During the last 50 years, the most widely used insect volatile repellent worldwide is the synthetic compound, DEET (N,N-diethyl-m-toluamide) (Katz et al., 2008Katz T.M. Miller J.H. Hebert A.A. Insect repellents: historical perspectives and new developments.J. Am. Acad. Dermatol. 2008; 58: 865-871Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). Advantages of DEET are that it is associated with relatively low toxicity when it is not consumed and that it can last for several hours when used at the highest concentrations. However, the potency of DEET is low as it is used most commonly at levels ranging from 25% to 100% (Katz et al., 2008Katz T.M. Miller J.H. Hebert A.A. Insect repellents: historical perspectives and new developments.J. Am. Acad. Dermatol. 2008; 58: 865-871Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). A controversial issue concerns the mode of action of DEET. There is evidence that DEET does not act directly as a volatile repellent but inhibits the positive olfactory responses to attractive compounds such as lactic acid (Dogan et al., 1999Dogan E.B. Ayres J.W. Rossignol P.A. Behavioural mode of action of deet: inhibition of lactic acid attraction.Med. Vet. Entomol. 1999; 13: 97-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, Ditzen et al., 2008Ditzen M. Pellegrino M. Vosshall L.B. Insect odorant receptors are molecular targets of the insect repellent DEET.Science. 2008; 319: 1838-1842Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). However, another study shows that ORNs in the mosquito, Culex quinquefasciatus, respond directly to DEET (Syed and Leal, 2008Syed Z. Leal W.S. Mosquitoes smell and avoid the insect repellent DEET.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2008; 105: 13598-13603Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). Whether DEET is also capable of acting through the sense of taste is not clear, although DEET has been reported to reduce landing behavior (Syed and Leal, 2008Syed Z. Leal W.S. Mosquitoes smell and avoid the insect repellent DEET.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2008; 105: 13598-13603Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). Here, we demonstrate that fruit flies are exquisitely sensitive at detecting minute concentrations of DEET through the gustatory response. We found that levels of DEET as low as 0.05% suppressed feeding. This behavior was mediated by direct activation of avoidance GRNs, since application of DEET elicited action potentials in these sensory neurons. In further support of this conclusion, DEET-induced action potentials were nearly eliminated by mutations disrupting any of three GRs (GR33a, GR66a, and GR32a), which are broadly expressed in avoidance GRNs. To determine whether DEET (Figure 1A ) can inhibit feeding by the fruit fly, we used a binary choice assay (Montell, 2009Montell C. A taste of the Drosophila gustatory receptors.Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2009; 19: 345-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). We placed flies in a 72-well microtiter dish containing either 1 mM sucrose or 5 mM sucrose and various concentrations of DEET. The wells were mixed with either red or blue food coloring so we could assess whether the animals consumed the lower or higher concentration of sugar by inspecting the colors of the abdomens. Complete preferences for 1 mM or 5 mM sucrose result in preference indexes (PIs) of 1.0 and 0, respectively, while a lack of discrimination between the two alternatives results in a PI of 0.5. In the absence of DEET, flies exhibit a strong preference for 5 mM sucrose (Figure 1B and see Table S1A available online). Introduction of only 0.4% DEET to the 5 mM sucrose induced almost complete avoidance (Figure 1B and Table S1A). Nearly as effective avoidance occurred with 0.2% DEET, and even 0.05% DEET reduced consumption of 5 mM sucrose (Figure 1B and Table S1A). The highly sensitive repulsion to sucrose laced with DEET would appear to occur through avoidance GRNs. However, current evidence is that the repulsive action of DEET is mediated by olfactory avoidance through ORNs (Ditzen et al., 2008Ditzen M. Pellegrino M. Vosshall L.B. Insect odorant receptors are molecular targets of the insect repellent DEET.Science. 2008; 319: 1838-1842Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar, Syed and Leal, 2008Syed Z. Leal W.S. Mosquitoes smell and avoid the insect repellent DEET.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2008; 105: 13598-13603Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). There is no clear documentation that DEET is sensed through GRNs. The GRNs and ORNs are housed in hair-like projections, referred to as sensilla (Vosshall and Stocker, 2007Vosshall L.B. Stocker R.F. Molecular architecture of smell and taste in Drosophila.Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2007; 30: 505-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (587) Google Scholar, Montell, 2009Montell C. A taste of the Drosophila gustatory receptors.Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2009; 19: 345-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). The olfactory sensilla are distributed on the antenna and maxillary palps. The main gustatory organ is the labellum, which is situated on the proboscis. Additional taste sensilla are distributed on the wing margins, leg tarsi, and female ovipositor. To identify the class of receptor cells that were required for repulsion to DEET in the food choice assay, we took advantage of the GAL4/UAS system to selectively inactive or kill GRNs or ORNs. To ablate these cells, we used the hid gene, which induces apoptosis cell autonomously. We expressed UAS-hid (Zhou et al., 1997Zhou L. Schnitzler A. Agapite J. Schwartz L.M. Steller H. Nambu J.R. Cooperative functions of the reaper and head involution defective genes in the programmed cell death of Drosophila central nervous system midline cells.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1997; 94: 5131-5136Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar) using either the Or83b-GAL4 (Larsson et al., 2004Larsson M.C. Domingos A.I. Jones W.D. Chiappe M.E. Amrein H. Vosshall L.B. Or83b encodes a broadly expressed odorant receptor essential for Drosophila olfaction.Neuron. 2004; 43: 703-714Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (846) Google Scholar), which directs expression in nearly all ORNs, or under the control of a GAL4 introduced into the Gr33a locus by homologous recombination (Gr33aGAL4) (Moon et al., 2009Moon S.J. Lee Y. Jiao Y. Montell C. A Drosophila gustatory receptor essential for aversive taste and inhibiting male-to-male courtship.Curr. Biol. 2009; 19: 1623-1627Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). The GAL4 in Gr33aGAL4/+ flies is expressed in virtually all GRNs that respond to aversive chemicals via contact chemosensation (Moon et al., 2009Moon S.J. Lee Y. Jiao Y. Montell C. A Drosophila gustatory receptor essential for aversive taste and inhibiting male-to-male courtship.Curr. Biol. 2009; 19: 1623-1627Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). We found that expression of UAS-hid in a Gr33aGAL4/+ background greatly decreased the aversion to 5 mM sucrose plus DEET (Figure 1C and Table S1B). In contrast, the UAS-hid or the UAS-hid/Or83b-GAL4 flies displayed the same repulsion to DEET as the wild-type control (+/Or83b-GAL4; Figure 1C). Thus, DEET is very effective at inhibiting feeding. To confirm that DEET suppresses feeding via contact chemosensation, we performed the binary food choice assay after inactivating the GRNs and ORNs by overexpressing the potassium channel, Kir2.1 (Baines et al., 2001Baines R.A. Uhler J.P. Thompson A. Sweeney S.T. Bate M. Altered electrical properties in Drosophila neurons developing without synaptic transmission.J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 1523-1531Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Increased expression of Kir2.1 suppresses action potential firing by hyperpolarizing neurons. We found that induction of Kir2.1 in GRNs but not in ORNs caused the avoidance behavior to low concentrations of DEET (Figure 1C). Because cell ablation or long-term distortion of electrical activity in GRNs could have unintended consequences on neighboring cells, we transiently inactivated the GRNs using a genetically encoded dominant temperature-sensitive blocker of synaptic transmission, shibirets1 (shits1) (Kitamoto, 2001Kitamoto T. Conditional modification of behavior in Drosophila by targeted expression of a temperature-sensitive shibire allele in defined neurons.J. Neurobiol. 2001; 47: 81-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (572) Google Scholar). At elevated temperatures such as 30°C, synaptic transmission in shits1-expressing neurons is rapidly blocked. Therefore, we reared Gr33aGAL4/UAS-shits1 flies at the permissive temperature (22°C). Consistent with the effects resulting from expression of hid or Kir2.1, we found that introduction of shits1 in GRNs reduced the repulsion to sucrose plus DEET, but only after the temperature shift from the permissive (22°C) to the restrictive temperature (30°C) (Figure 1D and Table S1C). The combination of data using hid, Kir2.1 and shits1 all support the conclusion that the potent suppression of feeding by DEET is due to detection of DEET through the sense of taste rather than smell. To address whether DEET can induce action potentials in GRNs, we performed tip recordings. We introduced recording electrodes with DEET over the dendritic tips of two types of taste sensilla. These include small (s-type) and large (l-type) sensilla, which respond to aversive and attractive tastants, respectively. We obtained spikes from s6 bristles upon application of 0.2% DEET (Figures 1E–1G). Even 0.02% DEET produced action potentials in these sensilla (Figure 1F and Table S1D). Four out of five additional s-type sensilla also responded to DEET (Figure S1A). The highest frequencies of action potentials were produced in s5, s6, s7, and s10 sensilla (Figure S1A). The s8 sensilla were unresponsive to DEET, while the s9 sensilla produced a significantly lower frequency of action potentials relative s5, s6, s7, and s10 (Figure S1A). Neither of the two types of l (large)-type sensilla tested (l4 and l6) responded to DEET (Figures 1G and S1A). These latter results were not due to a general deficit in responsiveness of the l4 sensilla, as we observed sucrose-induced potentials (Figure 1G). As has been observed with other aversive compounds (Meunier et al., 2003Meunier N. Marion-Poll F. Rospars J.P. Tanimura T. Peripheral coding of bitter taste in Drosophila.J. Neurobiol. 2003; 56: 139-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar), DEET reduced the frequency of sucrose-induced action potentials in l-type sensilla (Figures S1C and S1D). The ability to avoid DEET through the sense of smell requires the odorant co-receptor, OR83b (Ditzen et al., 2008Ditzen M. Pellegrino M. Vosshall L.B. Insect odorant receptors are molecular targets of the insect repellent DEET.Science. 2008; 319: 1838-1842Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). However, we found that in the absence of OR83b the flies effectively avoided eating the sucrose with DEET (Figure 2A and Table S1E). These results underscore that the ORNs and odorant receptors (ORs) are not the primary receptor cells or molecules involved in repulsion to DEET in the binary food assay. To determine which molecules are involved in the detection of DEET, we tested candidate gustatory receptors (GRs). GRs are predicted to include seven transmembrane domains and most are expressed either in GRNs that respond to attractive or aversive compounds (Montell, 2009Montell C. A taste of the Drosophila gustatory receptors.Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2009; 19: 345-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Fly GRs are unrelated to mammalian gustatory receptors and their sequence similarities to Drosophila ORs are minimal (Robertson et al., 2003Robertson H.M. Warr C.G. Carlson J.R. Molecular evolution of the insect chemoreceptor gene superfamily in Drosophila melanogaster.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2003; 100: 14537-14542Crossref PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar). We found that mutation of the gene encoding GR5a, which is expressed in GRNs and is required for the response to several sugars but not sucrose (Dahanukar et al., 2007Dahanukar A. Lei Y.T. Kwon J.Y. Carlson J.R. Two Gr genes underlie sugar reception in Drosophila.Neuron. 2007; 56: 503-516Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar), had no effect on DEET avoidance in the two-way choice tests (Figure 2A and Table S1E). Furthermore, mutation of Gr63a1, which encodes a CO2 receptor expressed in ORNs (Jones et al., 2007Jones W.D. Cayirlioglu P. Kadow I.G. Vosshall L.B. Two chemosensory receptors together mediate carbon dioxide detection in Drosophila.Nature. 2007; 445: 86-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar, Kwon et al., 2007Kwon J.Y. Dahanukar A. Weiss L.A. Carlson J.R. The molecular basis of CO2 reception in Drosophila.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2007; 104: 3574-3578Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar), did not impair the suppressive effects of DEET (Figure 2A and Table S1E). The prime candidate GRs for functioning in the detection of DEET are those that are required for responding to aversive compounds. Recently, we provided evidence that GR33a functions in collaboration with other GRs for detecting all compounds through contact chemosensation (Moon et al., 2009Moon S.J. Lee Y. Jiao Y. Montell C. A Drosophila gustatory receptor essential for aversive taste and inhibiting male-to-male courtship.Curr. Biol. 2009; 19: 1623-1627Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Indeed, we found that mutation of Gr33a1 impaired the repulsion to DEET (Figure 2A), and introduction of a wild-type Gr33a+ transgene rescued the phenotype (Figure 2B and Table S1F). These data indicate that the ability to avoid DEET through contact chemosensation requires at least one GR. Because GR33a appears to be a broadly required coreceptor (Moon et al., 2009Moon S.J. Lee Y. Jiao Y. Montell C. A Drosophila gustatory receptor essential for aversive taste and inhibiting male-to-male courtship.Curr. Biol. 2009; 19: 1623-1627Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar), we wondered whether other GRs are required in concert with GR33a to avoid DEET. Mutations in two genes, Gr8a2 and Gr47a1 (Y.L., S.J. Moon, and C.M., unpublished data), which are expressed in aversive GRNs did not disrupt DEET avoidance (Figure 2A). Disruption of Gr93a3 also had no impact on the repulsion to DEET (Figure 2A), consistent with our previous observation that it affects caffeine sensing only (Lee et al., 2009Lee Y. Moon S.J. Montell C. Multiple gustatory receptors required for the caffeine response in Drosophila.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2009; 106: 4495-4500Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, Gr66aex83 mutant animals, which are also compromised in caffeine avoidance (Moon et al., 2006Moon S.J. Köttgen M. Jiao Y. Xu H. Montell C. A taste receptor required for the caffeine response in vivo.Curr. Biol. 2006; 16: 1812-1817Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar), were impaired in DEET repulsion, similar to Gr33a1 animals (Figures 2A and 2D). Even more surprising, the ΔGr32a mutant, which displays increased male-to-male courtship behavior (Miyamoto and Amrein, 2008Miyamoto T. Amrein H. Suppression of male courtship by a Drosophila pheromone receptor.Nat. Neurosci. 2008; 11: 874-876Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar), was also required for avoiding DEET (Figures 2A and 2C; Tables S1E and S1G). Given the expression of Gr32a in aversive taste GRNs situated on leg tarsi (Miyamoto and Amrein, 2008Miyamoto T. Amrein H. Suppression of male courtship by a Drosophila pheromone receptor.Nat. Neurosci. 2008; 11: 874-876Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar), we tested whether the gustatory sensilla on the forelegs were responsive to DEET using an alternative assay, the proboscis extension response (PER). Application of sucrose only to wild-type forelegs resulted in extension of the proboscis in most animals tested (Figure S2E). Addition of DEET to the sucrose resulted in a significant reduction in the PER (Figure S2E). In contrast, application of sucrose plus DEET to the leg tarsi of ΔGr32a flies did not reduce the PER produced by presentation of sucrose alone (Figure S2E). These results indicate that the leg tarsi and Gr32a contribute to DEET avoidance. To provide additional evidence that Gr66a, Gr33a, and Gr32a functioned in GRNs for the detection of DEET, we performed tip recordings. Consistent with the behavioral assays, DEET-induced action potentials were profoundly reduced in Gr66aex83, Gr33a1, and ΔGr32a mutant animals (Figure 3A and Table S1I), and these defects were significantly reversed by introduction of the wild-type transgenes (Figures 3A and 3B). The mutations affecting other GRs, such as Gr63a1 or Gr93a3, did not impair DEET-induced action potentials (Figure 3A). Since Gr66a, Gr33a, and Gr32a are all required for the DEET response, they would be expected to be coexpressed in the same GRNs. We have shown previously that Gr66a and Gr33a are coexpressed in all of the same GRNs in the adult labellum (Moon et al., 2009Moon S.J. Lee Y. Jiao Y. Montell C. A Drosophila gustatory receptor essential for aversive taste and inhibiting male-to-male courtship.Curr. Biol. 2009; 19: 1623-1627Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Using a Gr32-GAL4 reporter, Gr32a has been reported to be expressed in 10 out of 12 s-type sensilla that express Gr66a (Hiroi et al., 2002Hiroi M. Marion-Poll F. Tanimura T. Differentiated response to sugars among labellar chemosensilla in Drosophila.Zoolog. Sci. 2002; 19: 1009-1018Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). To explore further the coexpression of Gr32a with the other two Grs (Gr33a and Gr66a) that participate in the DEET response, we ablated Gr33a-expressing cells using the UAS-hid and Gr33a-GAL4 and performed RT-PCR using primers specific for Gr32a. We found the product of the expected size, which was observed in wild-type, was absent from the labellum of the flies expressing UAS-hid under control of the Gr33a-GAL4 (Figure S2F). However, expression of UAS-hid using the Gr32-GAL4 did not eliminate Gr32a RNA production in the labellum (Figure S2F). The combination of these data indicate that Gr32a RNA was expressed in more GRNs than the Gr32a-GAL4 and suggests that it may be coexpressed in all of the same s-type sensilla that express Gr66a. Our data indicate that at least three GRs are required for sensing minute concentrations of DEET in GRNs. However, the minimum number may exceed three since misexpression of UAS-Gr66a, UAS-Gr33a, and UAS-Gr32a in either water- or sugar-activated GRNs, using the NP1017-GAL4 or the Gr5a-GAL4 respectively did not produce DEET-induced action potentials in these cells (data not shown). The results that Gr32a is required for DEET avoidance behavior and for DEET-induced action potentials in the labellum raise the question that Gr32a might also be required for sensing other aversive compounds through the sense of taste. To address this question, we performed electrophysiological as well as two-way choice assays. We found that ΔGr32a mutant animals showed impaired electrophysiological and behavioral response to all aversive chemicals tested, with the exception of caffeine, and these defects were rescued fully by the wild-type transgene (Figures 4A, 4B , and S3; Tables S1J and S1K). We also examined further the Gr66a gustatory phenotype, since Gr66a is required for sensing DEET and therefore does not function specifically for sensing caffeine. Using aversive compounds that we did not test earlier (Moon et al., 2006Moon S.J. Köttgen M. Jiao Y. Xu H. Montell C. A taste receptor required for the caffeine response in vivo.Curr. Biol. 2006; 16: 1812-1817Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar), we found Gr66aex83 flies were impaired in the behavioral and electrophysiological responses to lobeline and papaverine (Figures 4C and 4D; Tables S1L and S1M). As was the case for the Gr33a1 mutant flies (Moon et al., 2009Moon S.J. Lee Y. Jiao Y. Montell C. A Drosophila gustatory receptor essential for aversive taste and inhibiting male-to-male courtship.Curr. Biol. 2009; 19: 1623-1627Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar), the Gr66aex83 mutant elicited very few strychnine-induced action potential; however, the behavioral response to strychnine was not impaired (Figures 4C and 4D). Since GR33a is required for producing action potentials induced by a wide array of aversive compounds (Moon et al., 2009Moon S.J. Lee Y. Jiao Y. Montell C. A Drosophila gustatory receptor essential for aversive taste and inhibiting male-to-male courtship.Curr. Biol. 2009; 19: 1623-1627Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar), these results demonstrate that all three GRs that are necessary for responding to DEET, function broadly in the detection of noxious compounds. The observation that flies avoid consuming DEET suggests that this antifeedant is toxic to the flies. To test this proposal, we compared the survival of flies maintained on 1% sucrose, or after lacing the sucrose with small concentrations of DEET (0.1%–0.4%) (Figure 4E and Table S1N). 0.1% DEET did not cause lethality over the time course examined. However, 0.2% DEET caused lethality among 50% of the animals after 48 hr (LT50). The LT50 decreased to 38.4 hr in the presence of 0.4% DEET. Despite the extensive worldwide application of DEET for pest control, its mode of action remains controversial. While it is clear that the DEET is detected at least in part through ORNs and requires the olfactory coreceptor, OR83b, there is dispute as to whether this volatile chemical directly activates ORNs or masks the responses to attractive odorants, such as those that are food derived (Ditzen et al., 2008Ditzen M. Pellegrino M. Vosshall L.B. Insect odorant receptors are molecular targets of the insect repellent DEET.Science. 2008; 319: 1838-1842Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar, Syed and Leal, 2008Syed Z. Leal W.S. Mosquitoes smell and avoid the insect repellent DEET.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2008; 105: 13598-13603Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). However, of particular relevance here, it was not clear if DEET was detected through the sense of taste. Multiple lines of evidence support the conclusions that DEET is a highly potent at preventing feeding, and this behavioral aversion is mediated by direct activation of GRNs by DEET. These include the observations that levels of DEET as low as 0.05% discourage feeding, and minute concentrations (0.02%) induce action potentials in GRNs that are known to mediate avoidance behavior. Moreover, elimination or inactivation of GRNs that mediate avoidance responses greatly reduced the aversion to DEET. The detection of DEET through contact chemosensation may be increased further due to the distribution of DEET responsive gustatory sensilla on several body parts such as the legs and labellum. We uncovered the identities of three Grs (Gr32a, Gr33a, and Gr66a) that were critical for the detection of DEET. Expression of these Grs correlated well with the types of sensilla that responded to DEET, and the magnitudes of the responses. First, the l (large)-type sensilla do not express any of these Grs (Hiroi et al., 2002Hiroi M. Marion-Poll F. Tanimura T.

A Drosophila gustatory receptor essential for aversive taste and inhibiting male-to-male courtship.Curr. Biol. 2009; 19: 1623-1627Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar) and do not respond to DEET. Second, the three Grs may be coexpressed in all s-type sensilla. Expression of Gr33a and Gr66a appear to overlap completely in s-type sensilla (Moon et al., 2009Moon S.J. Lee Y. Jiao Y. Montell C. A Drosophila gustatory receptor essential for aversive taste and inhibiting male-to-male courtship.Curr. Biol. 2009; 19: 1623-1627Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Although the Gr32a-GAL4 has been reported to be expressed in 10 out of 12 s-type sensilla (Hiroi et al., 2002Hiroi M. Marion-Poll F. Tanimura T. Differentiated response to sugars among labellar chemosensilla in Drosophila.Zoolog. Sci. 2002; 19: 1009-1018Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar), we have presented evidence that it is produced in additional s-type sensilla and limited to Gr33a-expressing GRNs. Third, the four s-type sensilla that elicit the highest DEET-induced spike frequencies (s5, s6, s7, and s10) express relatively high levels of Gr66a (Hiroi et al., 2002Hiroi M. Marion-Poll F. Tanimura T. Differentiated response to sugars among labellar chemosensilla in Drosophila.Zoolog. Sci. 2002; 19: 1009-1018Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Conversely, the two s-type sensilla that produced either no detectable (s8) or relatively low levels (s9) of DEET-induced action potentials express comparably low levels of Gr66a (Hiroi et al., 2002Hiroi M. Marion-Poll F. Tanimura T. Differentiated response to sugars among labellar chemosensilla in Drosophila.Zoolog. Sci. 2002; 19: 1009-1018Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). We suggest that the repertoire of GRs that are minimally required for the DEET response may be four or more since misexpression of Gr32a, Gr33a, and Gr66a in GRNs that normally do not respond to DEET was insufficient to confer a DEET response to these neurons. These results are reminiscent of the findings that three GRs are required but not sufficient for the responses to bitter compounds such as caffeine (Moon et al., 2009Moon S.J. Lee Y. Jiao Y. Montell C. A Drosophila gustatory receptor essential for aversive taste and inhibiting male-to-male courtship.Curr. Biol. 2009; 19: 1623-1627Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Alternatively, we cannot exclude that an additional non-GR subunit is required in concert with GRs for function. Nevertheless, as we have discussed earlier, the complexities of Drosophila GRs exceed that of the Drosophila heterodimeric CO2 receptor and mammalian taste receptors (Lee et al., 2009Lee Y. Moon S.J. Montell C. Multiple gustatory receptors required for the caffeine response in Drosophila.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2009; 106: 4495-4500Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). The potent ability of DEET to prevent feeding was strictly dependent on GRNs and did not involve ORNs, since inactivation of ORNs had no effect. Furthermore, elimination of the broadly required olfactory coreceptor, OR83b, had little if any impact on the fly's gustatory aversion for DEET. Nevertheless, DEET is a volatile compound, and is also detected through non-contact chemosensation through ORNs. Thus, the effectiveness of DEET in pest control may result from its dual action in deterring insects simultaneously through contact and noncontact chemosensation, rather than exclusively through the olfactory response. Or83b-GAL4, Or83b2, Gr63a1, UAS-Kir2.1, and UAS-hid were from the Bloomington Stock Center. We described Gr93a3 (Lee et al., 2009Lee Y. Moon S.J. Montell C.

Presently, the mechanisms that trigger actin dynamics during these brain processes are poorly understood. In this study, we show that myosin II motor activity is downstream of LTP induction and is necessary for the emergence of specialized actin structures that stabilize an early phase of LTP. We also demonstrate that myosin II activity contributes importantly to an actin-dependent process that underlies memory consolidation. Pharmacological treatments that promote actin polymerization reversed the effects of a myosin II inhibitor on LTP and memory. We conclude that myosin II motors regulate plasticity by imparting mechanical forces onto the spine actin cytoskeleton in response to synaptic stimulation. These cytoskeletal forces trigger the emergence of actin structures that stabilize synaptic plasticity.

As such, elucidating the cellular and molecular processes supporting synaptic plasticity may reveal new targets for treating memory dysfunction. Actin filaments are the major cytoskeletal component of dendritic spines and appear to regulate both steady-state and plastic processes in CA1 pyramidal neurons (Allison et al., 1998Allison D.W.

Therefore, elucidating the regulatory mechanisms that influence dynamic actin will illuminate critical aspects of synaptic plasticity and memory formation, and harnessing the potential of these mechanisms could lead to novel treatments for memory disorders. Long-term potentiation (LTP) of excitatory synaptic responses is a cellular phenomenon widely regarded to be the substrate of multiple forms of learning and can be used to investigate the molecular events underlying memory acquisition and maintenance (Martin et al., 2000Martin S.J.

The dominant cellular model of memory formation is LTP in area CA1 of the adult hippocampus. This form of synaptic plasticity is accompanied by changes in the morphology of dendritic spines and synapses (Lang et al., 2004Lang C. Barco A. Zablow L. Kandel E.R. Siegelbaum S.A. Zakharenko S.S.

Rapid and persistent modulation of actin dynamics regulates postsynaptic reorganization underlying bidirectional plasticity.Nat.

The role of actin polymerization in modifying spine structure is consistent with the long-standing idea that synaptic potentiation is often dependent on the spine cytoarchitecture (Matus, 2000Matus A. Actin-based plasticity in dendritic spines.Science. 2000; 290: 754-758Crossref PubMed Scopus (663) Google Scholar). Taken together, these ideas suggest that the dynamic reorganization of actin filaments may represent an early step in information encoding. Therefore, identifying the molecules that trigger these cytoskeletal rearrangements may uncover novel mechanisms of memory formation. However, the molecular mechanisms at synapses that drive the emergence of new F-actin structures during circuit plasticity are unknown. The actin cytoskeleton is comprised of several distinct structures, including stable bundles, dynamic bundles, single filaments, and smaller structures defined as “arcs.” Conceptual approaches to understanding the dynamic nature of the actin cytoskeleton in neurons has focused on actin-binding proteins that regulate treadmilling, branching, and stabilization of individual filaments (Lynch et al., 2007Lynch G.

However, evidence from nonneuronal cells and immature neurons indicate that the actin cytoskeleton is actually a multiordered, dynamic structure capable of self-regulation through mechanical forces mediated by local network contractions (Mogilner and Keren, 2009Mogilner A. Keren K. The shape of motile cells.Curr. Biol. 2009; 19: R762-R771Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). These actin-mediated actin dynamics, combined with the activity of filament binding proteins, provide the necessary complexity for dynamic changes to neuronal morphology and cellular growth. Local actin network contractions provide the force necessary to trigger remodeling of larger F-actin structures, such as turnover of bundled fibers that provide the drive for rapid morphological changes in growth structures (Medeiros et al., 2006Medeiros N.A.

Considering that multiple pools of F-actin exist in dendritic spines (Honkura et al., 2008Honkura N. Matsuzaki M. Noguchi J. Ellis-Davies G.C. Kasai H.

Kwiatkowski D.J. Murthy V.N. Rapid turnover of actin in dendritic spines and its regulation by activity.Nat. Neurosci. 2002; 5: 239-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar), we hypothesized that forebrain excitatory synapses contain a similarly complex and dynamic system of cytoskeletal reorganization mechanisms. In immature neurons, myosin II directly alters cytoskeletal dynamics through ATPase-driven contraction of actin networks (Lin et al., 1996Lin C.H. Espreafico E.M. Mooseker M.S. Forscher P.

This property is in stark contrast to other forms of neuronal myosin, such as the cargo motors myosin V and VI. Although these vesicle-transport motors have received much attention in recent years for their roles in neuronal polarity and AMPA receptor trafficking (Correia et al., 2008Correia S.S. Bassani S.

For instance, myosin II-mediated contractility of actin networks in growth cones causes shearing of large actin bundles, which leads to the disassembly of the resulting small F-actin structures (Medeiros et al., 2006Medeiros N.A. Burnette D.T. Forscher P. Myosin II functions in actin-bundle turnover in neuronal growth cones.Nat. Cell Biol. 2006; 8: 215-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar). These monomeric globular (G)-actin molecules are then added to the growing end of actin bundles, resulting in growth cone propulsion. Acutely inhibiting myosin II arrests this retrograde flow of actin, resulting in growth cone collapse and inhibition of neurite elongation. Thus, paradoxically, myosin II is capable of indirectly causing both actin polymerization and depolymerization in the neuronal growth cone. Indeed, it is believed that activity of this motor imparts the actin cytoskeleton with the necessary complexity to drive the dynamics of growth structures (Backouche et al., 2006Backouche F. Haviv L. Groswasser D. Bernheim-Groswasser A. Active gels: dynamics of patterning and self-organization.Phys. Biol. 2006; 3: 264-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Myosin II is also abundantly expressed in the adult nervous system, with three distinct isoforms of myosin II heavy chains present in isolated postsynaptic densities of mature forebrain synapses (Cheng et al., 2000Cheng X.T.

Disrupting myosin II activity in cultured neurons alters the development of dendritic spines (Ryu et al., 2006Ryu J. Liu L. Wong T.P. Wu D.C. Burette A. Weinberg R. Wang Y.T. Sheng M. A critical role for myosin IIb in dendritic spine morphology and synaptic function.Neuron. 2006; 49: 175-182Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, Zhang et al., 2005Zhang H.

Neurosci. 2005; 25: 3379-3388Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar), though it is unknown if myosin II regulates actin networks in mature synapses. And further, the role of myosin II in plastic processes, such as LTP and memory formation, remains completely unexplored. Considering the importance of actin dynamics at excitatory synapses in the hippocampus, we hypothesized that myosin II-mediated mechanical forces in dendritic spines are necessary for the emergence of F-actin structures that stabilize synaptic plasticity and promote memory formation. Indeed, we demonstrate here that myosin II is a necessary component of hippocampus-dependent memory formation and synaptic plasticity in the mature nervous system. We found that myosin II function was upstream of actin polymerization and filament stabilization, consistent with the role of this protein complex as a regulator of dynamic actin structures. Myosin II activity was required for the initial stabilization of LTP at CA1 synapses, a period marked by rapid actin filament synthesis in response to synaptic NMDAR activation. Both actin polymerization and myosin II activity initiated by synaptic stimulation were necessary for the stabilization of synaptic plasticity over identical time courses, suggesting their activities are highly synchronized to convert newly potentiated synapses from a labile to stable state. Taken together, our data support a model where myosin IIb motor activity regulates NMDAR-driven actin network dynamics and show that this mechanism is necessary for synaptic plasticity and memory formation. To test the idea that myosin IIb is a critical regulator of synaptic plasticity, we developed a method that could selectively target myosin II motors in the adult hippocampus. rAAV2 virus particles psuedotyped with rAAV5 coat proteins (rAAV2/5) are especially effective tools for selectively transducing hippocampal neurons in vivo (Burger et al., 2004Burger C. Gorbatyuk O.S. Velardo M.J. Peden C.S. Williams P. Zolotukhin S. Reier P.J. Mandel R.J. Muzyczka N. Recombinant AAV viral vectors pseudotyped with viral capsids from serotypes 1, 2, and 5 display differential efficiency and cell tropism after delivery to different regions of the central nervous system.Mol. Ther. 2004; 10: 302-317Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (599) Google Scholar). We utilized a strong enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP) expressing rAAV2/5 virus in order to optimize injection location and volume. A single injection of rAAV2/5 particles resulted in selective expression of eGFP in dorsal CA1 that spread as much as a millimeter in the rostral-caudal axis (Figure 1A ). eGFP was expressed at very high levels in dendrites, most neurons in the dorsal CA1 were positive for eGFP, and transgene expression did not disrupt the cellular layers (Figure 1B). We next designed and packaged rAAV particles that express shRNAs in vivo that selectively target the heavy chain of myosin IIb, MyH10. These particles were in an identical virus package (rAAAV2/5), though they contained two expression cassettes. One drove weak wtGFP expression, while the other drove expression of shRNAs (control shRNA or MyH10-specific shRNA). Weak wtGFP expression allowed us to locate areas of CA1 with the highest levels of transduction, which facilitated LTP studies (Figure 1C). MyH10-shRNAs driven by these particles caused a 5-fold reduction in MyH10 expression from homogenates collected from dorsal hippocampus relative to control shRNA hippocampal samples (Figure S1). We next unilaterally injected either control or MyH10-shRNA virus into the dorsal hippocampus of adult rats to assess the physiological consequences of reducing MyH10 expression. The opposite, naive hemisphere provided critical internal controls for virus injection and hairpin expression. Thirty days after injection, which is the time necessary to reach maximum expression of packaged nucleic acids using rAAV2/5 particles (Burger et al., 2004Burger C. Gorbatyuk O.S. Velardo M.J. Peden C.S. Williams P. Zolotukhin S. Reier P.J. Mandel R.J. Muzyczka N. Recombinant AAV viral vectors pseudotyped with viral capsids from serotypes 1, 2, and 5 display differential efficiency and cell tropism after delivery to different regions of the central nervous system.Mol. Ther. 2004; 10: 302-317Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (599) Google Scholar), we prepared acute hippocampal slices from these animals. There were no gross structural differences between the injected and naive hemispheres in either virus group. The size and shape of field synaptic potentials elicited by stimulation of Schaffer-collateral afferents were equivalent among all groups, indicating that ∼80% reduction of MyH10 from the adult CA1 does not adversely affect basic synaptic function (Figure 1D). The initial potentiation following LTP induction was comparable across all slices, but there was a marked and selective deficit in LTP stability from slices expressing the MyH10 hairpin compared to naive (no injection) slices from the same animal (Figure 1E). Importantly, there was also no effect of the control shRNA on LTP stability (Figure 1E), indicating that the virus injection procedure and expression of exogenous noncoding RNAs do not affect LTP at these synapses. These data demonstrate that myosin IIb expression is critically important for stabilization, but not induction, of early LTP. Myosin II is a ubiquitous regulator of complex actin structures (Mogilner and Keren, 2009Mogilner A. Keren K. The shape of motile cells.Curr. Biol. 2009; 19: R762-R771Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar), and F-actin dynamics are regulated by LTP induction (Fukazawa et al., 2003Fukazawa Y. Saitoh Y. Ozawa F.

Rapid and persistent modulation of actin dynamics regulates postsynaptic reorganization underlying bidirectional plasticity.Nat. Neurosci. 2004; 7: 1104-1112Crossref PubMed Scopus (652) Google Scholar). To test the idea that myosin II regulates actin dynamics during LTP, we used a technique that labels F-actin synthesis in situ in response to LTP-inducing synaptic stimulation (Lin et al., 2005aLin B. Kramár E.A. Bi X. Brucher F.A. Gall C.M. Lynch G. Theta stimulation polymerizes actin in dendritic spines of hippocampus.J.

Different Rho GTPase-dependent signaling pathways initiate sequential steps in the consolidation of long-term potentiation.J. Cell Biol. 2009; 186: 85-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). This method exploits the fact that neurons, unlike other cell types, are permeable to phalloidin in a dose-dependent manner (Lin et al., 2005aLin B. Kramár E.A. Bi X. Brucher F.A. Gall C.M. Lynch G. Theta stimulation polymerizes actin in dendritic spines of hippocampus.J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 2062-2069Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar, Rex et al., 2009Rex C.S. Chen L.Y. Sharma A. Liu J.

Cell Biol. 2009; 186: 85-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). Spine-like structures labeled by phalloidin in response to theta burst stimulation (TBS) colocalized with PSD-95 (Figure 1F) and this increase in spine F-actin was blocked by NMDAR antagonists (Figure 1G). Also, phalloidin labeling intensity increased as a function of phalloidin concentration in slices (Figure S2). This technique was applied to the slices obtained from MyH10-shRNA-injected animals used for LTP studies (see Figure 1E). One hour after LTP induction, there were no differences in the density of phalloidin labeling found in spines within the zone of synaptic potentiation for control-virus-injected and naive hemispheres. Importantly, this labeling was equivalent to data from past studies (Lin et al., 2005aLin B. Kramár E.A. Bi X. Brucher F.A. Gall C.M. Lynch G. Theta stimulation polymerizes actin in dendritic spines of hippocampus.J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 2062-2069Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar, Rex et al., 2009Rex C.S. Chen L.Y. Sharma A. Liu J.

Cell Biol. 2009; 186: 85-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar), and these groups were not significantly different from each other (Figure 1H). In contrast, slices expressing MyH10-shRNAs demonstrated significantly depressed levels of activity-induced spine F-actin structures (Figure 1H). These data confirm that myosin IIb is necessary for the long-term expression of actin filaments following LTP induction and indicate that this motor protein regulates actin dynamics at synapses. To further investigate the mechanism of myosin II function during synaptic plasticity, we hypothesized that the myosin II complex was a target of NMDAR-activated signaling pathways initiated by LTP induction. Therefore, we probed hippocampal slices for a structural correlate of myosin II ATPase activity. Myosin II is a hexameric protein complex containing dimerized heavy chains, as well as two copies of a smaller regulatory light chain (MLC20). While the heavy chains possess a motor domain, myosin II activity is activated by phosphorylation of MLC20S19 (Vicente-Manzanares et al., 2009Vicente-Manzanares M. Ma X. Adelstein R.S. Horwitz A.R. Non-muscle myosin II takes centre stage in cell adhesion and migration.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2009; 10: 778-790Crossref PubMed Scopus (1313) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of MLC20S19 (p-MLC20S19) is the primary signal that activates the heavy-chain motor of nonmuscle myosin II (Even-Faitelson et al., 2005Even-Faitelson L. Rosenberg M. Ravid S.

To investigate myosin II phosphorylation at synapses, we used two distinct approaches. We first tested the idea that NMDAR activation of a pure synaptoneurosomal preparation could induce p-MLC20S19. Indeed, application of 100 μM NMDA induced p-MLC20S19, while also inducing cofilin phosphorylation (Figure 2A ). We then asked if NMDARs targeted myosin phosphorylation through Rho-GTPase signaling. Preincubation with the ROCK inhibitor, H1152 (1 μM), complexly blocked both myosin and cofilin phosphorylation by NMDA (Figure 2A). We next sought to determine if LTP induction caused MLC phosphorylation. We did this by exploiting a recently described method for probing phospho-protein l"

Divergence from H3 raises the possibility that CENP-A generates unique chromatin features to mark physically centromere location. Here we report the crystal structure of a subnucleosomal heterotetramer, human (CENP-A-H4)(2), that reveals three distinguishing properties encoded by the residues that comprise the CENP-A targeting domain (CATD; ref. 2): (1) a CENP-A-CENP-A interface that is substantially rotated relative to the H3-H3 interface; (2) a protruding loop L1 of the opposite charge as that on H3; and (3) strong hydrophobic contacts that rigidify the CENP-A-H4 interface. Residues involved in the CENP-A-CENP-A rotation are required for efficient incorporation into centromeric chromatin, indicating specificity for an unconventional nucleosome shape. DNA topological analysis indicates that CENP-A-containing nucleosomes are octameric with conventional left-handed DNA wrapping, in contrast to other recent proposals. Our results indicate that CENP-A marks centromere location by restructuring the nucleosome from within its folded histone core."
https://openalex.org/W2062464471,"Observations of distant bright quasars suggest that billion solar mass supermassive black holes (SMBHs) were already in place less than a billion years after the Big Bang. Models in which light black hole seeds form by the collapse of primordial metal-free stars cannot explain their rapid appearance due to inefficient gas accretion. Alternatively, these black holes may form by direct collapse of gas at the center of protogalaxies. However, this requires metal-free gas that does not cool efficiently and thus is not turned into stars, in contrast with the rapid metal enrichment of protogalaxies. Here we use a numerical simulation to show that mergers between massive protogalaxies naturally produce the required central gas accumulation with no need to suppress star formation. Merger-driven gas inflows produce an unstable, massive nuclear gas disk. Within the disk a second gas inflow accumulates more than 100 million solar masses of gas in a sub-parsec scale cloud in one hundred thousand years. The cloud undergoes gravitational collapse, which eventually leads to the formation of a massive black hole. The black hole can grow to a billion solar masses in less than a billion years by accreting gas from the surrounding disk."
https://openalex.org/W1909680668,"The biological role of IκBβ, a major isoform of the IκB (inhibitor of nuclear factor-κB) family of proteins, has proved difficult to establish. Work on mice lacking IκBβ now shows that it serves a dual role, both inhibiting and facilitating the inflammatory response. IκBβ acts through p65:c-Rel dimers to maintain prolonged expression of TNFα. As a result, IκBβ−/− mice are resistant to LPS-induced septic shock and collagen-induced arthritis, and therefore blocking IκBβ might be a promising new strategy for selectively inhibiting the chronic phase of TNFα production during the inflammatory response. Nuclear hypophosphorylated IκBβ is shown to bind p65:c-Rel dimers and maintain prolonged expression of TNF-α in response to stimulation by lipopolysaccharide. The activation of pro-inflammatory gene programs by nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) is primarily regulated through cytoplasmic sequestration of NF-κB by the inhibitor of κB (IκB) family of proteins1. IκBβ, a major isoform of IκB, can sequester NF-κB in the cytoplasm2, although its biological role remains unclear. Although cells lacking IκBβ have been reported3,4, in vivo studies have been limited and suggested redundancy between IκBα and IκBβ5. Like IκBα, IκBβ is also inducibly degraded; however, upon stimulation by lipopolysaccharide (LPS), it is degraded slowly and re-synthesized as a hypophosphorylated form that can be detected in the nucleus6,7,8,9,10,11. The crystal structure of IκBβ bound to p65 suggested this complex might bind DNA12. In vitro, hypophosphorylated IκBβ can bind DNA with p65 and c-Rel, and the DNA-bound NF-κB:IκBβ complexes are resistant to IκBα, suggesting hypophosphorylated, nuclear IκBβ may prolong the expression of certain genes9,10,11. Here we report that in vivo IκBβ serves both to inhibit and facilitate the inflammatory response. IκBβ degradation releases NF-κB dimers which upregulate pro-inflammatory target genes such as tumour necrosis factor-α (TNF-α). Surprisingly, absence of IκBβ results in a dramatic reduction of TNF-α in response to LPS even though activation of NF-κB is normal. The inhibition of TNF-α messenger RNA (mRNA) expression correlates with the absence of nuclear, hypophosphorylated-IκBβ bound to p65:c-Rel heterodimers at a specific κB site on the TNF-α promoter. Therefore IκBβ acts through p65:c-Rel dimers to maintain prolonged expression of TNF-α. As a result, IκBβ−/− mice are resistant to LPS-induced septic shock and collagen-induced arthritis. Blocking IκBβ might be a promising new strategy for selectively inhibiting the chronic phase of TNF-α production during the inflammatory response."
https://openalex.org/W2078184477,"The increased interest in the observation of main-belt asteroids in recent years has led to the identification of tens of asteroid pairs, which follow near-identical orbits around the Sun even though they are not physically bound together. Rotational fission of larger bodies has been hypothesized as a mechanism for their formation, an idea that gains support with some new observations. Theory predicts that the mass ratios of two asteroids in a pair will be than about 0.2 and that as the mass ratio approaches this upper limit, the spin period of the larger body is extended. Accordingly, photometric observations of 35 asteroid pairs reveal none with mass ratios greater than 0.2, and as mass ratios approach 0.2, primary periods grow longer. This suggests that asteroid pairs form by rotational fusion of a parent asteroid into a short-lived proto-binary system. Rotational fission may explain the formation of pairs of asteroids that have similar heliocentric orbits but are not bound together. These authors report photometric observations of a sample of asteroid pairs revealing that the primaries of pairs with mass ratios much less than 0.2 rotate rapidly, near their critical fission frequency. In agreement with crucial predictions, they do not find asteroid pairs with mass ratios larger than 0.2, and as the mass ratio approaches 0.2 the primary period grows long. Pairs of asteroids sharing similar heliocentric orbits, but not bound together, were found recently1,2,3. Backward integrations of their orbits indicated that they separated gently with low relative velocities, but did not provide additional insight into their formation mechanism. A previously hypothesized rotational fission process4 may explain their formation—critical predictions are that the mass ratios are less than about 0.2 and, as the mass ratio approaches this upper limit, the spin period of the larger body becomes long. Here we report photometric observations of a sample of asteroid pairs, revealing that the primaries of pairs with mass ratios much less than 0.2 rotate rapidly, near their critical fission frequency. As the mass ratio approaches 0.2, the primary period grows long. This occurs as the total energy of the system approaches zero, requiring the asteroid pair to extract an increasing fraction of energy from the primary's spin in order to escape. We do not find asteroid pairs with mass ratios larger than 0.2. Rotationally fissioned systems beyond this limit have insufficient energy to disrupt. We conclude that asteroid pairs are formed by the rotational fission of a parent asteroid into a proto-binary system, which subsequently disrupts under its own internal system dynamics soon after formation."
https://openalex.org/W2070030133,"The cholesterol transporter ATP-binding cassette transporter A1 (ABCA1) moves lipids onto apolipoproteins including apolipoprotein E (apoE), which is the major cholesterol carrier in the brain and an established genetic risk factor for late-onset Alzheimer disease (AD). In amyloid mouse models of AD, ABCA1 deficiency exacerbates amyloidogenesis, whereas ABCA1 overexpression ameliorates amyloid load, suggesting a role for ABCA1 in Aβ metabolism. Agonists of liver X receptors (LXR), including GW3965, induce transcription of several genes including ABCA1 and apoE, and reduce Aβ levels and improve cognition in AD mice. However, the specific role of ABCA1 in mediating beneficial responses to LXR agonists in AD mice is unknown. We evaluated behavioral and neuropathogical outcomes in GW3965-treated female APP/PS1 mice with and without ABCA1. Treatment of APP/PS1 mice with GW3965 increased ABCA1 and apoE protein levels. ABCA1 was required to observe significantly elevated apoE levels in brain tissue and cerebrospinal fluid upon therapeutic (33 mg/kg/day) GW3965 treatment. At 33 mg/kg/day, GW3965 was also associated with a trend toward redistribution of Aβ to the carbonate-soluble pool independent of ABCA1. APP/PS1 mice treated with either 2.5 or 33 mg/kg/day of GW3965 showed a clear trend toward reduced amyloid burden in hippocampus and whole brain, whereas APP/PS1-treated mice lacking ABCA1 failed to display reduced amyloid load in the whole brain and showed trends toward increased hippocampal amyloid. Treatment of APP/PS1 mice with either dose of GW3965 completely restored novel object recognition memory to wild-type levels, which required ABCA1. These results suggest that ABCA1 contributes to several beneficial effects of the LXR agonist GW3965 in APP/PS1 mice."

https://openalex.org/W1973218522,"The transcription factor p53 (also known as TP53) guards against tumour and virus replication and is inactivated in almost all cancers. p53-activated transcription of target genes is thought to be synonymous with the stabilization of p53 in response to oncogenes and DNA damage. During adenovirus replication, the degradation of p53 by E1B-55k is considered essential for p53 inactivation, and is the basis for p53-selective viral cancer therapies. Here we reveal a dominant epigenetic mechanism that silences p53-activated transcription, irrespective of p53 phosphorylation and stabilization. We show that another adenoviral protein, E4-ORF3, inactivates p53 independently of E1B-55k by forming a nuclear structure that induces de novo H3K9me3 heterochromatin formation at p53 target promoters, preventing p53-DNA binding. This suppressive nuclear web is highly selective in silencing p53 promoters and operates in the backdrop of global transcriptional changes that drive oncogenic replication. These findings are important for understanding how high levels of wild-type p53 might also be inactivated in cancer as well as the mechanisms that induce aberrant epigenetic silencing of tumour-suppressor loci. Our study changes the longstanding definition of how p53 is inactivated in adenovirus infection and provides key insights that could enable the development of true p53-selective oncolytic viral therapies."

Previously, we showed that human apolipoprotein A-I (apoA-I) decreases Aβ40 aggregation and toxicity. Here we demonstrate that apoA-I in lipidated or non-lipidated form prevents the formation of high molecular weight aggregates of Aβ42 and decreases Aβ42 toxicity in primary brain cells. To determine the effects of apoA-I on AD phenotype in vivo, we crossed APP/PS1ΔE9 to apoA-IKO mice. Using a Morris water maze, we demonstrate that the deletion of mouse Apoa-I exacerbates memory deficits in APP/PS1ΔE9 mice. Further characterization of APP/PS1ΔE9/apoA-IKO mice showed that apoA-I deficiency did not affect amyloid precursor protein processing, soluble Aβ oligomer levels, Aβ plaque load, or levels of insoluble Aβ in brain parenchyma. To examine the effect of Apoa-I deletion on cerebral amyloid angiopathy, we measured insoluble Aβ isolated from cerebral blood vessels. Our data show that in APP/PS1ΔE9/apoA-IKO mice, insoluble Aβ40 is increased more than 10-fold, and Aβ42 is increased 1.5-fold. The increased levels of deposited amyloid in the vessels of cortices and hippocampi of APP/PS1ΔE9/apoA-IKO mice, measured by X-34 staining, confirmed the results. Finally, we demonstrate that lipidated and non-lipidated apoA-I significantly decreased Aβ toxicity against brain vascular smooth muscle cells. We conclude that lack of apoA-I aggravates the memory deficits in APP/PS1ΔE9 mice in parallel to significantly increased cerebral amyloid angiopathy.

Rose et al. present radiocarbon records of surface and intermediate depth waters from two sediment cores in the southwest Pacific and Southern Ocean, and find a steady 170 per mil decrease in Δ14C that precedes and roughly equals in magnitude the decrease in the atmospheric radiocarbon signal during the early stages of the glacial–interglacial climatic transition. The initial rise in carbon dioxide levels may have originated from intermediate Southern Ocean water masses that were not strongly depleted in radiocarbon, followed by the release of radiocarbon-depleted carbon dioxide from deeper North Pacific waters. At the end of the last ice age, rising atmospheric CO2 levels coincided with a decline in radiocarbon activity, suggesting the release of highly radiocarbon-depleted CO2 from the deep ocean to the atmosphere. These authors present radiocarbon records of surface and intermediate-depth waters from two sediment cores and find an decrease in radiocarbon activity that precedes and roughly equals in magnitude the decrease in the atmospheric radiocarbon signal during the early stages of the glacial–interglacial climatic transition. Radiocarbon in the atmosphere is regulated largely by ocean circulation, which controls the sequestration of carbon dioxide (CO2) in the deep sea through atmosphere–ocean carbon exchange. During the last glaciation, lower atmospheric CO2 levels were accompanied by increased atmospheric radiocarbon concentrations that have been attributed to greater storage of CO2 in a poorly ventilated abyssal ocean1,2. The end of the ice age was marked by a rapid increase in atmospheric CO2 concentrations2 that coincided with reduced 14C/12C ratios (Δ14C) in the atmosphere3, suggesting the release of very ‘old’ (14C-depleted) CO2 from the deep ocean to the atmosphere3. Here we present radiocarbon records of surface and intermediate-depth waters from two sediment cores in the southwest Pacific and Southern oceans. We find a steady 170 per mil decrease in Δ14C that precedes and roughly equals in magnitude the decrease in the atmospheric radiocarbon signal during the early stages of the glacial–interglacial climatic transition. The atmospheric decrease in the radiocarbon signal coincides with regionally intensified upwelling and marine biological productivity4, suggesting that CO2 released by means of deep water upwelling in the Southern Ocean lost most of its original depleted-14C imprint as a result of exchange and isotopic equilibration with the atmosphere. Our data imply that the deglacial 14C depletion previously identified in the eastern tropical North Pacific5 must have involved contributions from sources other than the previously suggested carbon release by way of a deep Southern Ocean pathway5, and may reflect the expanded influence of the 14C-depleted North Pacific carbon reservoir across this interval. Accordingly, shallow water masses advecting north across the South Pacific in the early deglaciation had little or no residual 14C-depleted signals owing to degassing of CO2 and biological uptake in the Southern Ocean."

https://openalex.org/W1985048795,"α6* (asterisk indicates the presence of additional subunits) nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) are broadly implicated in catecholamine-dependent disorders that involve attention, motor movement, and nicotine self-administration. Different molecular forms of α6 nAChRs mediate catecholamine release, but receptor differentiation is greatly hampered by a paucity of subtype selective ligands. α-Conotoxins are nAChR-targeted peptides used by Conus species to incapacitate prey. We hypothesized that distinct conotoxin-binding kinetics could be exploited to develop a series of selective probes to enable study of native receptor subtypes. Proline6 of α-conotoxin BuIA was found to be critical for nAChR selectivity; substitution of proline6 with 4-hydroyxproline increased the IC(50) by 2800-fold at α6/α3β2β3 but only by 6-fold at α6/α3β4 nAChRs (to 1300 and 12 nM, respectively). We used conotoxin probes together with subunit-null mice to interrogate nAChR subtypes that modulate hippocampal norepinephrine release. Release was abolished in α6-null mutant mice. α-Conotoxin BuIA[T5A;P6O] partially blocked norepinephrine release in wild-type controls but failed to block release in β4(-/-) mice. In contrast, BuIA[T5A;P6O] failed to block dopamine release in the wild-type striatum known to contain α6β2* nAChRs. BuIA[T5A;P6O] is a novel ligand for distinguishing between closely related α6* nAChRs; α6β4* nAChRs modulate norepinephrine release in hippocampus but not dopamine release in striatum."

We have solved the structure of full-length SpRpn10 by determining the crystal structure of the von Willebrand factor type A domain and characterizing the full-length protein by NMR. We demonstrate that the single Ub-interacting motif (UIM) of SpRpn10 forms a 1:1 complex with Lys(48)-linked diUb, which it binds selectively over monoUb and Lys(63)-linked diUb. We further show that the SpRpn10 UIM binds to SpRpn12, a subunit of the lid subparticle, with an affinity comparable with Lys(48)-linked diUb. This is the first observation of a UIM binding other than a Ub fold and suggests that SpRpn12 could modulate the activity of SpRpn10 as a proteasomal Ub receptor."

Although none of the underlying cellular and molecular mechanisms of the Kv7-associated clinical syndromes are fully understood, the etiology of Kv7.4-mediated hearing loss is the least appreciated, and the progressive nature of the disease makes it most insidious.

In DFNA2, there is a spatiotemporal course in deterioration of hair cells.

Perhaps most puzzlingly is why degeneration of hair cells apparently precedes SGNs because they also express Kv7.4 and Kv7 channel subtypes (7Beisel K.W. Rocha-Sanchez S.M. Morris K.A. Nie L. Feng F.

Because Kv7 channels are activated at low membrane voltages (approximately –80 mV), they contribute substantially in establishing the resting membrane voltage (Vrest) of IHCs and, in doing so, control intracellular Ca2+ concentration (15Oliver D.

In this study, we demonstrate that linopirdine- and retigabine-sensitive currents produce a major impact on the Vrest and membrane excitability of young, adult, and senescent mouse SGNs. Moreover, differential expression of the current at apex-to-base axis of the cochlea and during aging may produce alterations in intracellular Ca2+ concentration, resulting in Ca2+-mediated apoptotic cell death. We conclude that in DFNA2 the loss of SGNs may occur independently and/or simultaneously with hair cell loss. This investigation was performed in accordance with the guidelines of the Animal Care and Use Committee of the University of California, Davis. Isolation of SGNs followed the detailed procedure outlined in a previous study (17Wei D. Jin Z. Järlebark L. Scarfone E. Ulfendahl M. Dev. Neurobiol. 2007; 67: 108-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). To ensure that adequate and satisfactory electrophysiological experiments were performed, we cultured SGNs for ∼24–48 h to allow the detachment of Schwann cells from the surfaces of the neurons. C57BL/6J mice were sacrificed, and the temporal bones were removed in solution containing minimum essential medium with Hanks' salt (Invitrogen) and 0.2 g/liter kynurenic acid, 10 mm MgCl2, 2% FBS (fetal bovine serum; v/v), and glucose (6 g/liter). The central spiral ganglion tissue was dissected out and split into apical and basal pieces across the modiolar axis. The tissue was digested in an enzyme mixture containing collagenase type I (1 mg/ml) and DNase (1 mg/ml) at 37 °C for 20 min. After a series of gentle trituration and centrifugation in 0.45 m sucrose, the cell pellets were reconstituted in 900 ml of culture media (NeurobasalTM A, supplemented with 2% B27 (v/v), 0.5 mm l-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin; Invitrogen) and filtered through a 40-μm cell strainer for cell culture and electrophysiological experiments. We pooled three 2-week-old postnatal and 3–4- and 17-month-old mice into each SGN culture. SGNs were kept in culture for ∼24–48 h to allow Schwann cells to detach from the cell bodies. Electrophysiological experiments were performed at room temperature (21–23 °C). All reagents were obtained from Sigma, unless otherwise specified. Whole-cell voltage clamp recordings of K+ currents in SGNs were performed using an Axopatch 200B amplifier (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA). Fire-polished electrodes (3–5 megohms) were pulled from borosilicate glass. The electrodes contained (in mm) the following: KCl 140, MgCl2 1, HEPES 10, EGTA 5, CaCl2 1, K2ATP 4, pH 7.2, with KOH. The external bath solution was constantly perfused (∼2–3 ml/min) and contained (in mm) the following: NaCl or choline-Cl 145, KCl 2, CaCl2 1.8, MgCl2 0.5, HEPES 10, d-glucose 5, pH 7.4, with NaOH. Outward K+ current traces were generated with depolarizing voltage steps from a holding potential of −90 mV and stepped to varying positive potentials (ΔV = 10 mV). Currents were measured with capacitance and series resistance compensations (>90%), filtered at 2 kHz using an 8-pole Bessel filter, and sampled at 5 kHz. Whole-cell K+ current amplitudes at varying test potentials were measured at the peak and steady-state levels using a peak and steady-state detection routine; the current was divided by the cell capacitance (picofarads) to generate the current density-voltage relationship. The Kv7-mediated currents were assessed as linopirdine- and/or retigabine-sensitive currents. The capacitative transients were used to estimate cell capacitance as an indirect measure of cell size. The seal resistance was typically 5–20 gigaohms. The liquid junction potentials were measured and corrected. Action potentials were amplified (100 times), filtered (bandpass 2–10 kHz), and digitized at 5–50 kHz using the Digidata 1200 (Molecular Devices) as described earlier (18Levic S. Nie L. Tuteja D.

Extracellular solution for most experiments contained (in mm) the following: NaCl 145, KCl 2, MgCl2 0.5, CaCl2 1.8, d-glucose 5, HEPES 10, pH 7.4. The stock solutions of all channel blockers and activators used were made either in double distilled H2O or DMSO and stored at −20 °C. The final concentration of DMSO in the recording bath solution was ∼0.001%. We recorded the relative levels of intracellular Ca2+ concentrations from SGNs. A fluorometric method with Fluo-4/AM as the Ca2+ indicator was used for assessing the relative cytoplasmic Ca2+ concentrations. SGNs were incubated in external solution with 1 μm Fluo-4/AM and pluronic F-127 (0.1%) for 15 min at room temperature. Linopirdine, retigabine, and high external K+ concentrations (10 mm) were added to the perfusate, and the Ca2+-dependent fluorescence was measured. Using a Zeiss LSM510 meta confocal microscope, excitation of Fluo-4 was performed with an argon laser at 488 nm, and the emitted light was reflected through a 505–550-nm bandpass filter from a 540-nm dichroic mirror. Data were captured with LSM510 software (Zeiss). SGNs under different treatment conditions were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 20 min. After three washes in PBS, SGNs were postfixed in ethanol/acetic acid (2:1) for 5 min. Following two washes in PBS, a 50-μl TUNEL reaction mixture (in situ cell death detection-fluorescein, Roche Applied Science) was added and incubated in the dark and humidified chamber for ∼2 h at 37 °C. The specimens were washed three times in PBS and were counterstained with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole·2HCl (DAPI), mounted, and viewed under a LSM510 confocal microscope. To assess Kv7 channel currents expressed by SGNs functionally, we capitalized on the sensitivity of the currents to linopirdine (9Jentsch T.J. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2000; 1: 21-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (692) Google Scholar, 20Xu T. Nie L. Zhang Y. Mo J. Feng W. Wei D. Petrov E. Calisto L.E. Kachar B. Beisel K.W. Vazquez A.E. Yamoah E.N. J. Biol.

Inward currents were suppressed by replacing external Na+ and Ca2+ with choline and Mg2+. Fig. 1, A and B, shows outward K+ currents recorded from mice 0.5-month (2 weeks)- and 17-month-old SGNs, isolated from the apex of the cochlea, before and after application of linopirdine. The linopirdine-sensitive (difference) current traces are shown below Fig. 1, A and B. Similarly, we examined the whole-cell K+ currents from SGNs from the base of the cochlea and compared the current magnitudes between 0.5- and 17-month-old neurons (Fig. 1, C and D). The linopirdine-sensitive currents, denoted henceforth as Kv7-mediated current, are shown below the original traces. The total K+ current magnitude varied between apical and basal SGNs, and the expression of the current differed during aging. For example, at a 0-mV step potential, the magnitude of the whole-cell K+ currents at the base were (base; in pA/picofarad) as follows: 0.5 month, 112 ± 18; 3–4 month, 78 ± 10; and 17 month, 111 ± 8 (n = 17). On the other hand, the magnitude of apical whole-cell K+ currents was invariably smaller than current from basal SGNs (apex; in pA/picofarad) as follows: 0.5 month, 81 ± 7; 3–4 month, 73 ± 11; and 17 month, 101 ± 5 (n = 17). Meanwhile, the contribution of Kv7-mediated currents in apical SGNs (Fig. 1E) was modest and varied from 12% at 0.5 month, 10% at 3–4 month, and 17% at 17 month. By contrast, the Kv7-mediated current in basal SGNs (Fig. 1F) constituted a substantial portion of the whole-cell K+ current ranging from 21% at 0.5 month, 15% at 3–4 months, and 26% at 17 months. Analyses of the tail currents showed that the voltage-dependent activation of Kv7-mediated currents showed a tendency for basal cells to be activated at a more negative voltage, with V½ = −48 ± 3 mV and slope factor, k, of 18 ± 4 mV (n = 17) compared with apical cells with V½ = −45 ± 5 mV and k = 20 ± 3 mV (n = 16). Moreover, there were no significant changes in the voltage-dependent properties of the current during aging (Fig. 1G, legend). Because substantial portions of the Kv7-mediated current are activated at potentials close to Vrest of SGNs (−70 to −50 mV), and because of the differential expression of the current along the axis of the cochlea and during development, we examined the effects of linopirdine on the membrane properties of SGNs. The Vrest of SGNs was invariably stable under control conditions as shown for an apical neuron from a 0.5-month-old mouse (Fig. 2A). Linopirdine produces reversible depolarization of the Vrest of SGNs (Fig. 2B). For 0.5-month-old SGNs, depolarization of Vrest was most prominent in basal neurons (p < 0.01) compared with apical ones (Fig. 2, C and D). Similarly, linopirdine-induced alterations of Vrest were documented in 3–4 month-old neurons (Fig. 2E and summary data in Fig. 2F, p < 0.05). By contrast, by 17 months, the effects of linopirdine were statistically unchanged in apical neurons compared with basal cells (Fig. 2, G and H, p < 0.05). The summary data on linopirdine-mediated changes in membrane potentials are shown in Fig. 2, I and J. Next, we examined the ensuing outcome of the effects of linopirdine on the firing pattern and frequency of action potentials (APs) in SGNs. Besides depolarization of Vrest, no changes in the evoked AP profile or frequency were observed in apical neurons at all ages (Fig. 3, A and B, and supplemental Tables S1 and S2). Other marked differences seen in the aging SGNs were as follows: AP duration, spike frequency, latency, and spike width in basal neurons (supplemental Tables S1 and S2). On the other hand, effects of the Kv7 current blocker on basal neurons were seen mainly as increased AP frequency (Fig. 3, C and D, Table 1, and supplemental Tables S3–S5).FIGURE 3Effects of blockage of Kv7 currents on membrane excitability of SGNs. A, injection of 0.1 nA current produced single spikes in apical SGNs isolated from 2-week-old (0.5-month) mice. We denoted these neurons as rapidly adapting neurons. Linopirdine (lino) had no noticeable effect on spike activity. B, similar data were obtained from 17-month-old apical SGNs. The summary data are outlined in Table 1 (also see supplemental Tables). C and D, in contrast, injection of 0.1 nA current produced multiple spikes in basal neurons (denoted as slowly adapting neurons), which was further enhanced upon application of linopirdine. C depicts recordings from 2-week-old mice and D represents data from 17-month-old SGNs.

Open table in a new tab To ensure that linopirdine-mediated alterations of Vrest and evoked APs were Kv7 current-specific, we examined the effects of a Kv7 channel opener, retigabine, on the membrane properties of SGNs. Consistent with the presence of Kv7 currents in SGNs, retigabine (10 μm) produced reversible hyperpolarization of the membrane potential (Fig. 4A). Apical and basal SGNs at 0.5, 3–4, and 17 months old responded equally to retigabine, resulting in significant hyperpolarization of the membrane potentials (Fig. 4, B–E). Consequently, there were corresponding reductions in the excitability of neurons producing robust reduction in spike numbers elicited in basal SGNs (Fig. 5 and Table 2). The effects of retigabine could be seen in SGNs at all ages examined (0.5–17 months old), suggesting the Kv7-mediated currents remain prominent in the life span of the neurons. Moreover, the effects of the drug on basal neurons were more pronounced than apical neurons (Table 2; also see supplemental Table S6–S8).FIGURE 5Retigabine, a Kv7-mediated current agonist, attenuated the excitability of SGNs from the apical and basal turn of the cochlea. A, action potentials were recorded from SGNs isolated from the apical turn of the cochlea by current injection of 0.1 nA. Shown are representative profiles recorded from 2-week-old (left panel) and 3–4- and 17-month-old SGNs. B, using similar recordings from basal SGNs, control neurons responded to current (0.2 nA) injected with repetitive firing that showed adaptation. Retigabine (reti) (10 μm) attenuated the AP firing. The number of spikes elicited and Vrest in apical cells for control were 1 ± 0 and −66 ± 4 mV and after application of retigabine were 0 ± 0 (n = 9) and −75 ± 5 mV, respectively. The number of spikes elicited and Vrest in basal cells for control were 29 ± 12 and −59 ± 3 mV and after application of retigabine were 1.5 ± 0.7 (n = 9) and −66 ± 3 mV, respectively.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)TABLE 2Effects of retigabine on membrane properties of SGNsAgeBaseApexControlRetigabineControlRetigabineSpike number2 weeks (n = 4)29 ± 122 ± 1n = 51 ± 00ap < 0.01 treatment versus control.3–4 months (n = 7)20 ± 60.4 ± 0.5ap < 0.01 treatment versus control.n = 81 ± 00ap < 0.01 treatment versus control.17 months (n = 5)22 ± 61 ± 1ap < 0.01 treatment versus control.n = 61 ± 00ap < 0.01 treatment versus control.Rmp (mV)2 weeks (n = 4)−58 ± 2−64 ± 1bp < 0.05.n = 5−66 ± 4−75 ± 5bp < 0.05.3–4 months (n = 7)−59 ± 3−66 ± 3bp < 0.05.n = 8−62 ± 2−66 ± 317 months (n = 5)−59 ± 3−69 ± 2ap < 0.01 treatment versus control.n = 6−61 ± 2−67 ± 2bp < 0.05.AP duration (ms)2 weeks (n = 4)7 ± 1n = 46 ± 23–4 months (n = 7)8 ± 2n = 78 ± 117 months (n = 5)6 ± 23 ± 0ap < 0.01 treatment versus control.n = 67 ± 1a p < 0.01 treatment versus control.b p < 0.05. Open table in a new tab The voltage ranges at which Kv7-mediated currents appear to predominate are relatively low (negative), and SGNs have been reported to express not only transient but also sustained low voltage-activated Ca2+ currents (21Santos-Sacchi J.

Accordingly, we predicted that linopirdine would invoke membrane depolarization, which will promote Ca2+ influx through activation of voltage-gated Ca2+ channels to increase intracellular Ca2+. Retigabine would be expected to produce an opposite effect. We measured intracellular Ca2+ changes using Fluo-4 fluorescence in the absence and presence of linopirdine (Fig. 6A). To examine the effects of retigabine on intracellular Ca2+, we depolarized SGNs by increasing the external K+ concentration from 2 to 10 mm, which was sufficient to produce an ∼30-mV change in membrane voltage, producing an increase in intracellular Ca2+ (Fig. 6B). Perfusion of retigabine resulted in gradual reduction of intracellular Ca2+, findings that are in keeping with the drug-mediated changes in the membrane potential of SGNs. It has been demonstrated that membrane depolarization and Ca2+ influx through voltage-gated Ca2+ channels promote SGN survival in vitro (13Hegarty J.L. Kay A.R. Green S.H. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 1959-1970Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Also important, and of significant clinical implications in vivo, is the finding that direct electrical stimulation of SGNs via an implanted electrode may increase SGN survival after hair cell loss (26Leake P.A. Hradek G.T. Snyder R.L. J. Comp. Neurol. 1999; 412: 543-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). We examined the effects of long term blockage of Kv7-mediated currents in vitro on SGNs (∼48 h) using TUNEL assay to determine neuronal survival under different control conditions as follows: 1) no growth factors; 2) in the presence of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and neurotrophin-3 (NT3); 3) at high extracellular K+ (10 mm) to induce sustained depolarization and by deduction an unrelenting increase in intracellular Ca2+; 4) inhibition of Kv7-mediated current by linopirdine; and 5) the apoptosis-induced drug 7,12-dimethylbenz[a]anthracene as a positive control (Fig. 7, A and B). SGNs in culture showing positive reactivity in TUNEL assay were counted and normalized against the total number of neurons as determined by TUJ1 neuronal marker reaction. The summary data shown in the histogram in Fig. 7B demonstrated that exposure of neurons in culture to 10 μm linopirdine resulted in a significant increase in apoptotic cell death (p < 0.01) compared with conditions of no growth factors and with BDNF and NT3. Indeed, the effect of linopirdine was equivalent to high K+ (10 mm)-induced depolarization of SGNs. In keeping with the functional data, the effects of linopirdine were pronounced in basal compared with apical neurons. Finally, we assessed the effects of linopirdine on apical and basal neurons (Fig. 8A) under reduced extracellular Ca2+ concentrations ([Ca2+]). To do this, we added EGTA in the culture media to obtain a final estimated [Ca2+] of ∼300 μm. Additionally, we reduced Ca2+ influx through voltage-gated Ca2+ channels by blocking a variety of Ca2+ currents (Fig. 8B, also see supplemental Fig. S1). By reducing Ca2+ entry, the effects of linopirdine on basal neurons were significantly reduced. Thus, Ca2+-mediated neuronal benefits (13Hegarty J.L. Kay A.R. Green S.H. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 1959-1970Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) may require tightly regulated mechanisms to finely tune the survival and death pathways. SGN depolarization that may ensue from reduced and removed activity of Kv7-mediated currents may ultimately result in neuronal degeneration as seen in DFNA2.FIGURE 8Analyses of the effects of linopirdine under reduced extracellular Ca2+ conditions and assessment of SGNs apoptosis. A, upper panel shows SGNs in control culture with BDNF/NT3 growth factors. A denotes apical and B denotes basal SGNs.

ThDP-dependent phosphoketolase plays key roles in the central metabolism of heterofermentative bacteria and in the pentose catabolism of various microbes. In particular, bifidobacteria, representatives of beneficial commensal bacteria, have an effective glycolytic pathway called bifid shunt in which 2.5 mol of ATP are produced per glucose. Phosphoketolase catalyzes two steps in the bifid shunt because of its dual-substrate specificity; they are phosphorolytic cleavage of fructose 6-phosphate or xylulose 5-phosphate to produce aldose phosphate, acetyl phosphate, and H2O. The phosphoketolase reaction is different from other well studied ThDP-dependent enzymes because it involves a dehydration step. Although phosphoketolase was discovered more than 50 years ago, its three-dimensional structure remains unclear. In this study we report the crystal structures of xylulose 5-phosphate/fructose 6-phosphate phosphoketolase from Bifidobacterium breve.

ThDP is a biologically active form of vitamin B1. ThDP-dependent enzymes are ubiquitously present in all organisms and catalyze various essential reactions in metabolic pathways. These enzymes generally catalyze the conversion of 2-keto acid and require ThDP and divalent cations as cofactors. Formation of ThDP ylide, which is accomplished by deprotonation of the C2 atom on the thiazolium ring, is the first essential activation step (Fig. 2) (8Breslow R. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1958; 80: 3719-3726Crossref Scopus (1414) Google Scholar, 9Kluger R. Tittmann K. Chem. Rev. 2008; 108: 1797-1833Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). ThDP-dependent enzymes are divided into four families based on their primary and tertiary structures (10Duggleby R.G. Acc. Chem. Res. 2006; 39: 550-557Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Three of the four families catalyze oxidative decarboxylation reactions to produce biologically essential metabolites such as acetyl-CoA (9Kluger R. Tittmann K. Chem. Rev. 2008; 108: 1797-1833Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar, 11Jordan F. Nat. Prod. Rep. 2003; 20: 184-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar, 12Tittmann K.

Acetyl phosphate (acetyl-P)-producing pyruvate oxidase (POX), which belongs to one of the oxidative decarboxylation-catalyzing families, cleaves pyruvate in the presence of inorganic phosphate (Pi) and O2 to produce acetyl-P, CO2, and H2O2 (Fig. 2) (13Muller Y.A. Schulz G.E. Science. 1993; 259: 965-967Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). TK is a representative member of the fourth family (known as the TK family). The reactions of enzymes belonging to this family are significantly different from those belonging to other families because the TK family enzymes catalyze non-oxidative reactions. TK catalyzes the cleavage of a C-C bond in ketose phosphate (donor substrate) into a two-carbon fragment and aldose phosphate. This cleavage is subsequently followed by condensation of the ThDP-bound two-carbon fragment with aldose (acceptor substrate). PK belongs to the TK family, and there are two types of enzymes with different preferences for sugar phosphate substrates exist. Xylulose-5-phosphate PK (XPK, EC 4.1.2.9) prefers xylulose 5-phosphate (X5P) to fructose 6-phosphate (F6P) (5Heath E.C. Hurwitz J. Horecker B.L. Ginsburg A. J. Biol.

These enzymes constitute two homologous (sequence identity > 40%) but phylogenetically distinct groups (supplemental Figs. 1 and 2 and supplemental Table 1) (17Sánchez B. Zúñiga M.

Because PK activity against F6P is specific to the bifid shunt, it is employed as the most reliable non-molecular test for identification of bifidobacteria (18Scardovi V. Sneath P.H.A. Mair N.S.

XPK is a key enzyme in the pentose catabolism in various microbes, including filamentous fungi and yeasts (17Sánchez B. Zúñiga M. González-Candelas F. de los Reyes-Gavilán C.G. Margolles A. J. Mol. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 2010; 18: 37-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). This pentose catabolism is called the “PK pathway” (20Panagiotou G. Andersen M.R. Grotkjaer T. Regueira T.B. Hofmann G. Nielsen J. Olsson L. PloS one. 2008; 3: e3847Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the PK pathway is the central pathway in the metabolism of heterofermentative lactic acid bacteria including the genera Lactobacillus and Leuconostoc. Heterofermentative lactic acid bacteria, representatives of beneficial gut microbes (probiotics), produce lactic and acetic acids as the main end products. These short-chain fatty acids are important for hosts, not only because they prevent the growth of harmful bacteria by lowering the intestinal pH but also because they serve as an energy source for intestinal epithelial cells. In addition, short-chain fatty acids can modulate intestinal immune and inflammatory responses via G-protein-coupled receptors (21Maslowski K.M. Vieira A.T. Ng A. Kranich J. Sierro F. Yu D.

Recently, kinetic analysis of PK-2 from Lactobacillus plantarum, belonging to the XPK group, revealed that the reaction follows a ping-pong bi-bi mechanism, leading to the proposal that the first-half of the reaction by PK proceeds through the same mechanism as TK and forms an α,β-dihydroxyethyl ThDP (DHEThDP) intermediate (Fig. 2) (22Yevenes A. Frey P.A. Bioorg Chem. 2008; 36: 121-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). However, the subsequent reaction catalyzed by PK is distinct from TK at the following two points; 1) the dehydration reaction occurs, and 2) the acceptor substrate Pi is believed to attack the possible 2-acetyl-ThDP (AcThDP) intermediate, similar to the case of acetyl-P-producing POX. Recently, preliminary x-ray crystallographic studies of XPK from Lactococcus lactis (23Petrareanu G. Balasu M.C. Zander U. Scheidig A.J. Szedlacsek S.E. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. F Struct. Biol. Cryst. Commun. 2010; 66: 805-807Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar) and XFPK from Bifidobacterium breve 203 (BbXFPK) (24Suzuki R. Kim B.-J. Iwamoto Y. Katayama T. Ashida H. Wakagi T. Shoun H. Fushinobu S. Yamamoto K. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. F Struct. Biol. Cryst. Commun. 2010; 66: 941-943Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar) are reported. In this study we report the crystal structure of BbXFPK as the first three-dimensional structure of PK. The structures of the resting form, the two intermediates before and after dehydration (DHEThDP and AcThDP), the complex with the acceptor substrate Pi, and four mutant enzymes have been determined. This study revealed a structural basis for the reaction mechanism of a ThDP-dependent enzyme involving dehydration and nucleophilic attack of Pi to the AcThDP intermediate. Construction of the expression vector, protein expression, purification, and kinetic analysis employing F6P as the donor substrate were performed as described previously (24Suzuki R. Kim B.-J.

Mutants of BbXFPK were constructed using a QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) using the primers summarized in supplemental Table 2. Native (resting) BbXFPK and its mutants were crystallized according to the method described previously (24Suzuki R. Kim B.-J. Iwamoto Y. Katayama T. Ashida H. Wakagi T. Shoun H. Fushinobu S. Yamamoto K. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. F Struct. Biol. Cryst. Commun. 2010; 66: 941-943Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Structures of AcThDP intermediate (BbXFPK/AcThDP), DHEThDP intermediate (BbXFPK/DHEThDP), and BbXFPK in complex with the acceptor substrate Pi (BbXFPK/Pi) were trapped using cryocrystallography technique. Crystals of BbXFPK/AcThDP were prepared by soaking native BbXFPK crystals in mother liquor (24% (v/v) PEG 6000, 0.1 m Bicine buffer, pH 9.0) containing 27 mm F6P for various time periods at room temperature. BbXFPK/DHEThDP crystals were obtained by soaking in 54 mm F6P solution for 15 s. Crystals of BbXFPK/Pi were obtained by cocrystallization with 5 mm potassium phosphate. The mother liquor containing 20% ethylene glycol was used as a cryoprotectant, except for the BbXFPK/Pi complex for which 20% glycerol was used. Selenomethionine-labeled enzyme was expressed in Escherichia coli B834 (DE3) (Novagen, Madison, WI). Diffraction data were collected using beamlines at SPring-8 (Harima, Japan) and Photon Factory (Tsukuba, Japan). Diffraction data were processed using HKL2000 (25Otwinowski Z. Minor W.

Open table in a new tab The crystal structures (residues 5–806) of the resting form, the AcThDP intermediate, the DHEThDP intermediate, and the complex with Pi were determined at 1.7, 1.9, 2.1, and 2.3 Å, respectively (Table 1). The dimeric and monomeric structures of BbXFPK are shown in Fig. 3, A and B. BbXFPK consists of three α/β-fold domains; N-terminal (PP domain, residues 5–378), middle (Pyr domain, residues 379–611), and C-terminal (residues 612–806) domains. The crystals contain one molecule per asymmetric unit, and a crystallographic 2-fold axis is consistent with the molecular axis of the dimer. The active site is positioned at the interface between the PP and Pyr domains from different subunits to form a deep and narrow substrate channel, and the reactive C2 atom of ThDP is only accessible from the solvent. These observations suggest that the minimum functional unit of the enzyme is a homodimer. The overall architectures of the monomer and the tightly packed homodimer of BbXFPK are basically similar to those of TK (Fig. 3C) (3Schneider G. Lindqvist Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1385: 387-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), with a root mean square deviation of 2.6 Å for 545 α-carbon atoms. However, they share very low sequence homology, with a sequence identity of 15% based on structural alignment with TK from Saccharomyces cerevisiae (ScTK). Three active peaks of BbXFPK appeared on gel filtration chromatography with different estimated sizes (24Suzuki R. Kim B.-J. Iwamoto Y. Katayama T. Ashida H. Wakagi T. Shoun H. Fushinobu S. Yamamoto K. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. F Struct. Biol. Cryst. Commun. 2010; 66: 941-943Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). A sample from the major homohexameric peak successfully crystallized, whereas those from the two minor peaks (homodimer and homotetramer) failed to crystallize. We examined the crystal packing, but there was no strong interaction that possibly interconnects the dimer units (data not shown). The biological assembly might have collapsed under the crystallization condition. In all structures determined here, ThDP binds in a typical V-conformation (Fig. 4). The pyrimidine and thiazolium rings are held mainly through the hydrophobic residues of the PP and Pyr domains (supplemental Fig. 3A). The diphosphate group of ThDP and the hexacoordinated Mg2+ are anchored to the PP domain through many interactions (supplemental Fig. 3B). Several histidine residues in the active site as well as other residues important for catalysis are completely conserved between BbXFPK and TK (discussed later). In the initial reaction step of all ThDP-dependent enzymes, formation of reactive ThDP ylide is achieved by cofactor-assisted deprotonation of the C2 atom of the thiazolium ring by the N4′-imino group of the pyrimidine ring, and the imino tautomer is stabilized by a completely conserved Glu residue (9Kluger R. Tittmann K. Chem. Rev. 2008; 108: 1797-1833Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar, 32Kern D. Kern G. Neef H. Tittmann K. Killenberg-Jabs M. Wikner C. Schneider G. Hübner G. Science. 1997; 275: 67-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). In the resting structure, interactions between the N4′ atom and the reactive C2 atom (2.9 Å) and between the N1′ atom of pyrimidine and the conserved Glu479 (2.7 Å) residue are present (Fig. 4A). Replacement of this residue (E479A) completely abolished the activity (Table 2). These results indicate that the initial activation mechanism of BbXFPK to form ThDP ylide is identical to that of other ThDP-dependent enzymes.TABLE 2Kinetic parameters for wild-type and mutant BbXFPKEnzymeKcatApparent KmCofactor in mutant structuresaCrystallographic data collected after soaking in 27 mm F6P for 5 min.

Open table in a new tab When we collected diffraction data from crystals soaked in 27 mm F6P for 5 min in the absence of Pi, extra electron density was observed (Fig. 4B). The density corresponds to three branched carbon or oxygen atoms and is covalently attached to the C2 atom of the thiazolium ring. The appearance of the electron density did not change when the soaking time was varied in a range from 1 to 60 min (data not shown). The central Cα atom appears to be sp2-hybridized because the map of the covalent adduct is trigonal planar (Fig. 4B, inset). Based on these observations, we concluded that the covalent adduct is an acetyl group. It has been proposed that AcThDP formed after dehydration is a stable intermediate of PK in the absence of the acceptor, Pi (22Yevenes A. Frey P.A. Bioorg Chem. 2008; 36: 121-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 33Frey P.A. Biofactors. 1989; 2: 1-9PubMed Google Scholar). One of the two terminal atoms is located close to the NE2 atom of His-553 (2.5 Å) and the N4′ atom of the pyrimidine ring (3.2 Å) (Fig. 5A, gray). Superimposition with the ScTK-DHEThDP structure illustrates that this atom overlaps with the Cα hydroxyl group of DHEThDP (Fig. 5B), suggesting that it is an oxygen atom. Careful inspection of the heights of electron density peaks and temperature factors supported this assignment of terminal oxygen and carbon atoms. We refined the structure using the parameters of keto-AcThDP. The resolution was not sufficiently high to determine whether it is a keto or an enol form. The planar character of the Cα atom is consistent with the similar AcThDP adduct of L. plantarum POX (LpPOX) (34Wille G. Meyer D. Steinmetz A. Hinze E. Golbik R. Tittmann K. Nat. Chem. Biol. 2006; 2: 324-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). A water molecule is located 3.2 Å from the terminal Cβ atom of the acetyl group (discussed later). Then we prepared a crystal by soaking in 54 mm F6P for a short time period (15 s), and a clear electron density peak corresponding to the Cβ hydroxyl group of DHEThDP was observed (Fig. 4C). The electron density map for the DHE moiety is relatively weak but is sufficiently clear in shape, and is interpreted as DHEThDP. An electron density peak that corresponds to the water molecule in the AcThDP structure was also observed, but the distance from the Cβ hydroxyl atom (Oβ) was abnormally close (2.0 Å). We repeatedly refined the crystal structure by changing the occupancies of these elements (the DHE moiety and the water molecule) and then examined the resultant |Fo| − |Fc| difference map. We finished the refinement by setting the occupancies to 0.7 for the water molecule (B factor = 9.8 Å2), 0.3 for the Oβ atom (B factor = 16.3 Å2), and 0.5 for the other three atoms of the DHE moiety (Cα, Oα, and Cβ; average B factor = 24.9 Å2). The average B factor of the remaining moiety of the ThDP cofactor was 18.8 Å2. Thus, this crystal was assumed to be a mixture of free ThDP with the water (0.5 fraction), DHEThDP without the water (0.3), and AcThDP with the water (0.2). This result indicates that the DHEThDP intermediate is transient under this condition. The map around the central Cα atom is not planar, suggesting that this atom has an sp3-hybridized character (Fig. 4C, inset). Because of limited resolution (2.1 Å), low occupancy (0.3), and the electron density overlaps with those of other states, the hybridization state of the Cα atom cannot be determined unambiguously. However, crystallographic refinement with parameters of the sp2 hybridized (flat) Cα atom resulted in the appearance of significant difference peaks near the Oα and Oβ atoms in the |Fo| − |Fc| map (data not shown). Observation of the sp3-hybridized Cα atom suggests that the resonance hybrid between the neutral enamine and zwitterionic α-carbanion in our DHEThDP structure is unlikely present. Instead, the structure is likely a protonated state at the Cα atom with the S-configuration (S-α,β-dihydroxyethyl-ThDP; Fig. 2, boxed with a broken line). Although the crystal structure was obtained at pH 9.0, the local environment may stabilize the protonated state. In contrast, the DHEThDP intermediate of ScTK was observed as an sp2-hybridized enamine character (Fig. 5C) (4Fiedler E. Thorell S. Sandalova T. Golbik R. König S. Schneider G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2002; 99: 591-595Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). The terminal Cβ hydroxyl group interacts with the NE2 atom of His-142 (2.9 Å), the main chain oxygen atom of Gly-155 (2.9 Å), and the N4′ group of the pyrimidine moiety (3.2 Å). The branched Cα hydroxyl group interacts with the NE2 atom of His-553 (2.6 Å), but the N4′ atom of pyrimidine moiety is distant (3.6 Å). The fourth structure, a complex with the acceptor substrate, Pi, was prepared by cocrystallization in the presence of Pi. A clear tetrahedral electron density peak was observed near the C2 atom of the thiazolium ring (Fig. 4D). The four structures of the wild-type BbXFPK determined in this work did not show any significant conformational changes around the active site. This observation indicates that the formation of reaction intermediates and binding of the acceptor substrate do not induce remarkable conformational change, which is consistent with previous findings in ScTK (4Fiedler E. Thorell S. Sandalova T. Golbik R. König S. Schneider G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2002; 99: 591-595Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar) and LpPOX (34Wille G. Meyer D. Steinmetz A. Hinze E. Golbik R. Tittmann K. Nat. Chem. Biol. 2006; 2: 324-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). The substrate binding channel of ScTK has been identified by the complex structure with erythrose 4-phosphate (35Nilsson U. Meshalkina L. Lindqvist Y. Schneider G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1864-1869Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Moreover, the crystal structures of TK from E. coli (EcTK) in complex with uncleaved donor substrates, tetrahedral covalent X5P-ThDP and F6P-ThDP adducts, have been reported (36Asztalos P. Parthier C. Golbik R. Kleinschmidt M. Hübner G. Weiss M.S. Friedemann R. Wille G. Tittmann K. Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 12037-12052Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). In the tetrahedral substrate-cofactor adducts, the C2-Cα bond between the cofactor and substrate is distorted from the planarity, and the leaving group is perpendicularly orientated to the thiazolium ring of ThDP (Fig. 6). The out-of-plane distortions of the C2-Cα bond and the perpendicular orientation of the leaving groups are considered to facilitate the elimination of the first product (9Kluger R. Tittmann K. Chem. Rev. 2008; 108: 1797-1833Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar, 37Tittmann K. Wille G. J. Mol. Catal. B Enzym. 2009; 61: 93-99Crossref Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Therefore, the covalent F6P-ThDP adduct of BbXFPK is also expected to adopt a similar conformation. Superimposition of the resting BbXFPK and F6P-ThDP adduct of EcTK revealed that F6P can bind in the active site channel of BbXFPK without any steric hindrance, leading to the estimation of residues involved in substrate recog"
https://openalex.org/W2113144912,"The purpose of our study was to investigate the role of endogenous p63RhoGEF in G(q/11)-dependent RhoA activation and signaling in rat aortic smooth muscle cells (RASMCs). Therefore, we studied the expression and subcellular localization in freshly isolated RASMCs and performed loss of function experiments to analyze its contribution to RhoGTPase activation and functional responses such as proliferation and contraction. By this, we could show that p63RhoGEF is endogenously expressed in RASMCs and acts there as the dominant mediator of the fast angiotensin II (ANG II)-dependent but not of the sphingosine-1-phosphate (S(1)P)-dependent RhoA activation. p63RhoGEF is not an activator of the concomitant Rac1 activation and functions independently of caveolae. The knockdown of endogenous p63RhoGEF significantly reduced the mitogenic response of ANG II, abolished ANG II-induced stress fiber formation and cell elongation in 2-D culture, and impaired the ANG II-driven contraction in a collagen-based 3-D model. In conclusion, our data provide for the first time evidence that p63RhoGEF is an important mediator of ANG II-dependent RhoA activation in RASMCs and therewith a leading actor in the subsequently triggered cellular processes, such as proliferation and contraction."
https://openalex.org/W2096222136,"Fluid balance is critical to life and hence is tightly controlled in the body. Angiotensin II (ANGII), one of the most important components of this regulatory system, is recognized as a dipsogenic hormone that stimulates vasopressin (VP) expression and release. However, detailed mechanisms regarding how ANGII brings about these changes are not fully understood. In the present study, we show initially that the osmoregulatory functions of secretin (SCT) in the brain are similar to those of ANGII in mice and, more important, we discovered the role of SCT as the link between ANGII and its downstream effects. This was substantiated by the use of two knockout mice, SCTR(-/-) and SCT(-/-), in which we show the absence of an intact SCT/secretin receptor (SCTR) axis resulted in an abolishment or much reduced ANGII osmoregulatory functions. By immunohistochemical staining and in situ hybridization, the proteins and transcripts of SCT and its receptor are found in the paraventricular nucleus (PVN) and lamina terminalis. We propose that SCT produced in the circumventricular organs is transported and released in the PVN to stimulate vasopressin expression and release. In summary, our findings identify SCT and SCTR as novel elements of the ANGII osmoregulatory pathway in maintaining fluid balance in the body."

https://openalex.org/W1988594236,"DegS is a periplasmic Escherichia coli protease, which functions as a trimer to catalyze the initial rate-limiting step in a proteolytic cascade that ultimately activates transcription of stress response genes in the cytoplasm. Each DegS subunit consists of a protease domain and a PDZ domain. During protein folding stress, DegS is allosterically activated by peptides exposed in misfolded outer membrane porins, which bind to the PDZ domain and stabilize the active protease. It is not known whether allostery is conferred by the PDZ domains or is an intrinsic feature of the trimeric protease domain. Here, we demonstrate that free DegSΔPDZ equilibrates between active and inactive trimers with the latter species predominating. Substrate binding stabilizes active DegSΔPDZ in a positively cooperative fashion. Mutations can also stabilize active DegSΔPDZ and produce an enzyme that displays hyperbolic kinetics and degrades substrate with a maximal velocity within error of that for fully activated, intact DegS. Crystal structures of multiple DegSΔPDZ variants, in functional and non-functional conformations, support a two-state model in which allosteric switching is mediated by changes in specific elements of tertiary structure in the context of an invariant trimeric base. Overall, our results indicate that protein substrates must bind sufficiently tightly and specifically to the functional conformation of DegSΔPDZ to assist their own degradation.

Thus, substrate binding alone may have regulated the activities of ancestral DegS trimers with subsequent fusion of the protease domain to a PDZ domain, resulting in ligand-mediated regulation. Proteases are carefully regulated to ensure that these destructive enzymes are only activated under the proper circumstances. For example, most extracellular proteases are synthesized as inactive proenzymes or zymogens (1Neurath H. Walsh K.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1976; 73: 3825-3832Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). In the trypsin proenzyme, the Ser-His-Asp catalytic triad is properly formed, but the oxyanion hole of the active site is malformed and only rearranges to the active structure following the processing event that produces the mature enzyme (2Stroud R.M. Kossiakoff A.A. Chambers J.L. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Bioeng. 1977; 6: 177-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). The activities of intracellular trypsin-like proteases are also regulated by changes in active site conformation. In the DegS protease, for instance, alternative conformations of the oxyanion hole result in an equilibrium distribution of inactive and active enzymes whose populations are controlled by the binding of substrates and allosteric effectors (3Walsh N.P.

Alba B.M. Bose B. Gross C.A. Sauer R.T. Cell. 2003; 113: 61-71Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar, 9Kim D.Y. Kim K.K. J. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2005; 38: 266-274Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The trimer is stabilized by interactions between the protease domains. Protein folding stress in the periplasm activates DegS cleavage of RseA, a transmembrane protein whose cytoplasmic domain binds and inhibits the σE transcription factor (10Alba B.M. Gross C.A. Mol. Microbiol. 2004; 52: 613-619Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar, 11Ades S.E. Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 2008; 11: 535-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). DegS cleavage of RseA initiates a cascade of subsequent cleavages by other proteases, resulting in release of σE and transcriptional activation of genes whose products are needed to repair damage caused by envelope stress. The PDZ domain of DegS plays a critical role in signal transduction. Specifically, C-terminal peptides of misfolded outer membrane porins (OMPs), 2The abbreviations used are: OMPouter membrane porinDFPdiisopropylfluorophosphateMismonoisopropylphosphorylserine. which end with a conserved Tyr-Xaa-Phe motif, bind to the PDZ domain, and activate cleavage of RseA (Fig. 1A and Ref. 3Walsh N.P. Alba B.M. Bose B. Gross C.A. Sauer R.T. Cell. 2003; 113: 61-71Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar). Indeed, DegS cleavage of RseA in vitro can be accelerated more than 500-fold by OMP peptides (6Sohn J. Grant R.A. Sauer R.T.

OMP peptide activation of DegS appears to occur by relieving inhibitory contacts between the PDZ domain and the protease domain. For example, salt bridges between the PDZ domain and the protease domain are observed in crystal structures of peptide-free DegS, which has a malformed oxyanion hole, but these interactions are absent in peptide-bound DegS, which has a functional oxyanion hole (4Wilken C. Kitzing K. Kurzbauer R. Ehrmann M. Clausen T. Cell. 2004; 117: 483-494Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar, 5Zeth K. FEBS Lett. 2004; 569: 351-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Importantly, disrupting inhibitory interactions between the PDZ domain and the protease domain by point mutations or by deleting the PDZ domain entirely (DegSΔPDZ) activates cleavage of RseA to levels observed with some OMP peptides (6Sohn J. Grant R.A. Sauer R.T. Cell. 2007; 131: 572-583Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 7Sohn J. Sauer R.T. Mol. Cell. 2009; 33: 64-74Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Moreover, crystal structures of DegSΔPDZ closely resemble the active conformation of intact DegS (Fig. 1, B and C) and have a functional oxyanion hole (6Sohn J. Grant R.A. Sauer R.T. Cell. 2007; 131: 572-583Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 12Hasselblatt H. Kurzbauer R. Wilken C. Krojer T. Sawa J. Kurt J. Kirk R. Hasenbein S. Ehrmann M. Clausen T. Genes Dev. 2007; 21: 2659-2670Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). These results support an allosteric model in which the unliganded PDZ domain stabilizes the inactive protease domain conformation, whereas OMP peptide binding to the PDZ domain reduces or eliminates this inhibitory effect. Although both OMP peptides and the RseA substrate bind more tightly to active DegS than to inactive DegS, neither saturating peptide nor saturating RseA is sufficient to shift the majority of enzymes into the active conformation (7Sohn J. Sauer R.T. Mol. Cell. 2009; 33: 64-74Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). As a consequence, substrate cleavage is positively cooperative with respect to both RseA concentration and OMP peptide concentration. Moreover, because OMP peptides and RseA bind both to inactive and active DegS, it cannot be assumed that activity measured in the presence of saturating peptide and saturating substrate corresponds to the maximal cleavage rate that would be observed if all enzymes assumed the active conformation (7Sohn J. Sauer R.T. Mol. Cell. 2009; 33: 64-74Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). In fact, different OMP peptides support very different maximal levels of RseA cleavage. Moreover, cleavage activity can be increased above the wild-type DegS level by mutations that disrupt inhibitory interactions and by mutations that stabilize the active conformation (6Sohn J. Grant R.A. Sauer R.T. Cell. 2007; 131: 572-583Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 8Sohn J. Grant R.A. Sauer R.T. Structure. 2009; 17: 1411-1421Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Is allostery an intrinsic property of the protease domain of DegS, or is it only conferred by the presence of the PDZ domains? The protease activity of the DegSΔPDZ trimer is substantially lower than that of full-length DegS stimulated by OMP peptides with the highest activities (6Sohn J. Grant R.A. Sauer R.T. Cell. 2007; 131: 572-583Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 7Sohn J. Sauer R.T. Mol.

Genes Dev. 2007; 21: 2659-2670Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). There are two potential explanations for this fact. DegSΔPDZ itself may equilibrate between inactive and active conformations (Fig. 1D), and substrate binding may be insufficient to shift most enzymes into the active state. Alternatively, all DegSΔPDZ enzymes may assume the “functional” conformation, but this structure may have lower activity than peptide-activated full-length DegS because of subtle changes in structure or dynamics. For example, based on differences observed in crystal structures, it was concluded that DegSΔPDZ has “a less ordered active site with reduced proteolytic activity” (12Hasselblatt H. Kurzbauer R. Wilken C. Krojer T. Sawa J. Kurt J. Kirk R. Hasenbein S. Ehrmann M. Clausen T. Genes Dev. 2007; 21: 2659-2670Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). To probe mechanism, we characterized structure-activity relationships for variants of E. coli DegSΔPDZ. Importantly, we found that the H198P mutation decreased Km, increased Vmax, and essentially eliminated the positive cooperativity of substrate cleavage when compared with wild-type DegSΔPDZ. These results strongly support a model in which positive cooperativity arises for wild-type DegSΔPDZ because substrates bind more tightly to the active than inactive conformation and are inconsistent with a model in which positive cooperativity is a consequence of substrate-substrate interactions as was suggested previously (6Sohn J. Grant R.A. Sauer R.T. Cell. 2007; 131: 572-583Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). We also found that the protease activity of DegSΔPDZ could be decreased by many of the same mutations that destabilize the active conformation of full-length DegS. Moreover, crystal structures of DegSΔPDZ, H198P DegSΔPDZ, and inactive DegSΔPDZ mutants define two basic conformations with functional and non-functional oxyanion holes, respectively. Thus, our combined results support a two-state model in which allostery is an intrinsic property of the protease domain of DegS. Variants of E. coli DegSΔPDZ (residues 27–256) with an N-terminal His6 tag and lacking the wild-type membrane anchor were purified by Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid affinity chromatography and gel filtration on a Superdex 200 column (6Sohn J.

Cell. 2009; 33: 64-74Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). An 35S-labeled variant of the periplasmic domain of E. coli RseA (residues 121–216) with a C-terminal His6 tag and a His6-tagged variant of DegS (residues 27–355) were purified as described (6Sohn J.

Cell. 2009; 33: 64-74Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Mutations were generated in plasmid-borne genes by the QuikChange method (Stratagene). The synthetic YYF peptide was purified by HPLC. Modification with diisopropylfluorophosphate (DFP) was performed as described (8Sohn J. Grant R.A. Sauer R.T. Structure. 2009; 17: 1411-1421Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Cleavage assays were performed as described (6Sohn J. Grant R.A. Sauer R.T.

Cell. 2009; 33: 64-74Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Enzymes were incubated with 35S-labeled RseA for different times at room temperature (23 ± 1 °C), and cleavage was quantified by scintillation counting of acid-soluble radioactivity. Michaelis-Menten curves were fitted to the Hill equation using the non-linear least square subroutine in KaleidaGraph (Synergy software). DegSΔPDZ variants were crystallized at 20 °C by hanging drop vapor diffusion crystallization using protein stocks at 10–20 mg/ml in 50 mm NaHPO4 (pH 8.0), 200 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, and 10% glycerol. All crystals were obtained after 1:1 mixing with 50 mm sodium cacodylate (pH 6.5), 50–150 mm sodium citrate, and 15–20% isopropanol and were cryoprotected by using 30% methylpentanediol. Diffraction data were collected using a Rigaku MicroMax008-HP rotating source or at the NE-CAT 24-ID-C beamline at the Argonne National Laboratory Advanced Photon Source. Initial phases were obtained by molecular replacement using PHASER (13Storoni L.C. McCoy A.J. Read R.J. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2004; 60: 432-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (1086) Google Scholar). Structures were determined by cycles of model building using COOT and refinement using PHENIX (14Emsley P. Cowtan K. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2004; 60: 2126-2132Crossref PubMed Scopus (22497) Google Scholar, 15Adams P.D. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Hung L.W. Ioerger T.R. McCoy A.J. Moriarty N.W. Read R.J.

To obtain the best possible geometry, all structures were refined with riding hydrogen atoms, which were added using REDUCE (16Word J.M. Lovell S.C. Richardson J.S. Richardson D.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 285: 1733-1747Google Scholar). This procedure does not result in the introduction of additional parameters during refinement as the positions and B-factors of hydrogens are determined by the atoms to which they were attached. Refinement statistics for all final structures were also determined after stripping the hydrogens (without allowing changes in coordinates or B-factors of other atoms). As shown in Table 1, removing the hydrogens resulted in very small differences in Rwork and Rfree. Model building was guided by MolProbity (17Davis I.W. Leaver-Fay A. Chen V.B. Block J.N. Kapral G.J.

In the final structures, fewer than 0.2% of residues had poor side-chain rotamers, none were Ramachandran outliers, and 98% or more were in the most favored regions of the Ramachandran plot (Table 1).TABLE 1Crystallographic data and refinement statistics for DegSΔPDZ structuresWild typeDFP-modifiedH198PR178AQ191AY162AY162A/H198PT167V/H198PProtein Data Bank code3LGI3LH33LGV3LGY3LH13LGU3LGT3LGWSpace groupP212121P212121P212121H3H3H3H3H3Unit cell (Å)a = 70.38, b = 72.76, c = 128.87a = 71.53, b = 132.74, c = 231.20a = 71.54, b = 133.56, c = 230.27 Åa = 70.22, b = 70.22, c = 119.23 Åa = 70.89, b = 70.89, c = 120.84 Åa = 70.56, b = 70.56, c = 118.32 Åa = 70.65, b = 70.65, c = 120.05 Åa = 70.66, b = 70.66, c = 121.03 ÅSubunits/asymmetric unit39911111Resolution (Å)1.652.352.732.702.512.462.692.50Wavelength (Å)0.979330.979491.541781.541780.979491.541781.541781.54178Rsym0.069 (0.481)0.070 (0.401)0.097 (0.502)0.058 (0.201)0.058 (0.163)0.043 (0.131)0.035 (0.212)0.034 (0.138)Unique reflections79450 (2513)84470 (2046)55770 (2337)5394 (2556)6637 (905)7790 (2648)5868 (2933)7320 (3759)Completeness (%)99.4 (89)91.0 (64)94.1 (80)89.3 (85)85.4 (59)97.3 (99)93.5 (93)94.0 (97)Data redundancy12.9 (4.2)6.4 (5.5)5.6 (5.3)10.2 (5.6)7.1 (5.5)5.5 (5.3)4.5 (3.7)4.2 (2.5)Average I/σI35.2 (3.4)18.4 (4.6)12.8 (3.4)33.0 (4.6)26.7 (6.7)26.9 (5.5)25.1 (4.9)27.8 (5.5)Rwork (%)15.2 (19.5)18.5 (20.5)22.0 (25.8)23.6 (24.2)22.2 (29.5)21.0 (25.1)22.0 (24.5)21.2 (22.2)Rfree (%)18.2 (22.4)22.7 (26.9)27.1 (34.5)25.2 (29.7)25.9 (36.0)24.6 (31.2)26.2 (32.1)24.1 (30.8)Rwork/Rfree (no hydrogen)15.9/18.918.5/22.921.7/27.023.5/25.421.9/25.320.9/22.621.6/24.821.0/24.8r.m.s.d. bond length (Å)0.0050.0040.0040.0040.0050.0030.0040.004r.m.s.d. bond angle (°)1.0430.8830.8000.8030.8250.7670.8220.844Total atoms including hydrogen11199286422713225992894283926662784Solvent atoms8367372111210281021Average B-value19.946.052.187.782.074.992.879.8RamachandranaAllowed/favorable Ramachandran angles, allowed rotamers, and the all-atom clash score (number of steric overlaps ≥0.4 Å/1000 atoms) were calculated using MolProbity (17). favored/allowed (%)99.1/10098.8/10098.2/10098.8/10099.0/10098.3/10098.2/10098.3/100Favorable rotamersaAllowed/favorable Ramachandran angles, allowed rotamers, and the all-atom clash score (number of steric overlaps ≥0.4 Å/1000 atoms) were calculated using MolProbity (17).

Open table in a new tab For the structural comparisons shown in Fig. 5, individual subunits were initially aligned to a single reference structure using PyMOL. For each pairwise combination of structures, a displacement between corresponding Cα positions (e.g. residue 60) was calculated, and then these values were averaged over the entire set of comparisons involving that residue. If the Cα atom was missing in one or both structures, a displacement between 5 and 7 Å was assigned using a random number algorithm. Each wild-type or mutant variant of DegS (residues 27–355) or DegSΔPDZ (residues 27–256) lacked the wild-type membrane anchor and contained His6 affinity tags as described (3Walsh N.P. Alba B.M. Bose B. Gross C.A. Sauer R.T. Cell. 2003; 113: 61-71Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar, 6Sohn J. Grant R.A. Sauer R.T. Cell. 2007; 131: 572-583Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). We previously found that the H198P substitution in DegS increased basal RseA cleavage in the absence of OMP peptide and enhanced peptide-stimulated cleavage under conditions of limiting substrate (8Sohn J. Grant R.A. Sauer R.T. Structure. 2009; 17: 1411-1421Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). These results were explained by crystal structures that revealed packing contacts between Pro198 and Tyr162, which stabilize the active oxyanion hole and thus shift the conformational equilibrium to favor active DegS (8Sohn J. Grant R.A. Sauer R.T. Structure. 2009; 17: 1411-1421Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). As a result, the H198P mutation should only increase DegSΔPDZ activity if this truncated enzyme also exists as an equilibrium mixture of inactive and active species. Earlier studies comparing DegSΔPDZ and peptide-activated DegS used non-quantitative assays or utilized OMP peptides that are now known to be suboptimal for activation (6Sohn J. Grant R.A. Sauer R.T. Cell. 2007; 131: 572-583Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 7Sohn J. Sauer R.T. Mol. Cell. 2009; 33: 64-74Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 12Hasselblatt H. Kurzbauer R. Wilken C. Krojer T. Sawa J. Kurt J. Kirk R. Hasenbein S. Ehrmann M. Clausen T. Genes Dev. 2007; 21: 2659-2670Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). To eliminate these problems, we measured cleavage of a sub-Km concentration of 35S-labeled RseA and used saturating concentrations of an YYF tripeptide, which is as potent as any known OMP peptide (7Sohn J. Sauer R.T. Mol. Cell. 2009; 33: 64-74Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Under these conditions, DegSΔPDZ cleaved RseA ∼4.5-fold more slowly than peptide-activated DegS (Fig. 2A). Importantly, however, H198P DegSΔPDZ cleaved RseA much faster than either wild-type DegSΔPDZ or YYF-activated DegS and at ∼70% the rate of YYF-activated H198P DegS (Fig. 2A). When we determined the steady-state rate of RseA cleavage at saturating substrate concentrations, peptide-activated DegS was slightly more active than peptide-activated H198P DegS, and H198P DegSΔPDZ had ∼85% the activity of the latter enzyme (Fig. 2B). These results confirm that the H198P mutation increases DegS activity only by increasing the concentration of active relative to inactive species and also strongly support an allosteric model in which this mutation also stabilizes an active conformation of DegSΔPDZ. If the H198P mutation stabilizes an active conformation relative to an inactive conformation of DegSΔPDZ, then both the Hill constant and apparent Km (substrate concentration at half-maximal activity) should be lower for the mutant than for the wild-type truncated enzyme (6Sohn J. Grant R.A. Sauer R.T. Cell. 2007; 131: 572-583Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). To test this prediction, we assayed the steady-state rate of cleavage as a function of RseA concentration (Fig. 3A). Cleavage by DegSΔPDZ showed substantial positive cooperativity (Hill constant, 1.7 ± 0.1), and half-maximal degradation required a substrate concentration of ∼650 μm as expected from previous studies (6Sohn J. Grant R.A. Sauer R.T. Cell. 2007; 131: 572-583Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). By contrast, cleavage by H198P DegSΔPDZ showed almost no cooperativity (Hill constant, 1.1 ± 0.1), and half-maximal degradation was observed at a concentration of ∼90 μm. These results support a model in which the majority of unliganded DegSΔPDZ molecules assume an inactive conformation in solution with substrate binding and the H198P mutation acting to shift the equilibrium to favor the active structure. A model of Monod-Wyman-Changeux allostery (Fig. 3B) in which substrate binds 5-fold more tightly to active than inactive DegSΔPDZ with a conformational equilibrium constant of 115 for the unliganded wild-type species and 0.15 for the H198P mutant produced good fits of the experimental data in Fig. 3A (R2 > 0.986). For wild-type DegSΔPDZ, this model predicts that 1% of the enzymes are active in the absence of the substrate, and 48% assume the active conformation in the presence of saturating RseA substrate. For H198P DegSΔPDZ, these values are 87 and 99%, respectively. We solved crystal structures of DegSΔPDZ at 1.65-Å resolution, of H198P DegSΔPDZ at 2.7-Å resolution, and of DegSΔPDZ modified by reaction with DFP at 2.35-Å resolution (Table 1). The latter structure is a mimic for the substrate-bound acyl enzyme. In each of the 21 crystallographically independent subunits in these three structures, the oxyanion hole was in the active conformation (Fig. 4A). In the structure of DFP-treated DegSΔPDZ, the active site serine (Ser201) was modified to monoisopropylphosphorylserine (Mis201), and the O1P oxygen of this residue occupied the oxyanion hole and accepted hydrogen bonds from the backbone -NH groups of Gly199 and Ser201 (Fig. 4B). The side chain of Pro198 in H198P DegSΔPDZ packed against the aromatic ring of Tyr162 (Fig. 4C) as observed previously in the structure of a full-length DegS variant containing the H198P substitution (8Sohn J. Grant R.A. Sauer R.T. Structure. 2009; 17: 1411-1421Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). This interaction should increase the stability of the functional conformation of the oxyanion hole by helping to stabilize the hydrogen bond between the backbone -NH of Tyr162 and the carbonyl oxygen of Pro198 (Fig. 4C). Based on a DegSΔPDZ structure, Hasselblatt et al. (12Hasselblatt H. Kurzbauer R. Wilken C. Krojer T. Sawa J. Kurt J. Kirk R. Hasenbein S. Ehrmann M. Clausen T. Genes Dev. 2007; 21: 2659-2670Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) concluded that Asp126 in the catalytic triad was too far from His96 to allow efficient activation of Ser201 for nucleophilic attack on the RseA substrate. Our results do not support this model. In the catalytic triad shown in Fig. 4D, for example, the hydrogen bond between the Oδ2 oxygen of Asp126 and Nδ2 nitrogen of His96 is 2.8 Å. This value is very similar to the distances observed in peptide-activated DegS and other serine proteases (4Wilken C. Kitzing K. Kurzbauer R. Ehrmann M. Clausen T.

Soc. 2008; 73: 393-403Crossref Scopus (5) Google Scholar). Similarly, the hydrogen bond between the Nϵ2 nitrogen of His96 and Oγ oxygen of Ser201 is 3.1 Å (Fig. 4D), which is typical of serine proteases and active DegS. We did find that the catalytic triads in many DegSΔPDZ subunits were disrupted by rotation of the His96 side chain away from Ser201 and Asp126. Importantly, however, there was no correlation between solution activity and the number of irregular active sites in various structures. For example, His96 assumed a rotamer incompatible with catalysis in seven of nine subunits in the asymmetric unit of the H198P DegSΔPDZ crystal. However, this enzyme variant was substantially more active than wild-type DegSΔPDZ in which only two of 15 rotamers of His96 were aberrant in the structures reported here and previously (Protein Data Bank codes 2QF0 and 2QF3; Ref. 6Sohn J. Grant R.A. Sauer R.T. Cell. 2007; 131: 572-583Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Moreover, the irregular rotamer of His96 was observed in six of nine subunits in DFP-modified DegSΔPDZ, and yet these active sites had to be functional for modification of Ser201 to occur in the first place. His96 probably equilibrates between active and inactive rotamer conformations in all of these structures with small changes in crystal packing influencing the rotamer observed. Previously, we found that the R178A mutation severely reduced the activity of DegS and DegSΔPDZ (6Sohn J. Grant R.A. Sauer R.T. Cell. 2007; 131: 572-583Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). In our active DegSΔPDZ structures, the side chains of Arg178 and Gln191 were hydrogen-bonded to each other and to the side chain of Thr167 from an adjacent subunit (Fig. 4E). The Thr167-Arg178-Gln191 network is not present in the structures of DegSΔPDZ and peptide-bound DegS reported by Hasselblatt et al. (12Hasselblatt H. Kurzbauer R. Wilken C. Kroj"
https://openalex.org/W2089313893,"Exo-1,5-α-l-arabinofuranosidases belonging to glycoside hydrolase family 43 have strict substrate specificity. These enzymes hydrolyze only the α-1,5-linkages of linear arabinan and arabino-oligosaccharides in an exo-acting manner. The enzyme from Streptomyces avermitilis contains a core catalytic domain belonging to glycoside hydrolase family 43 and a C-terminal arabinan binding module belonging to carbohydrate binding module family 42. We determined the crystal structure of intact exo-1,5-α-l-arabinofuranosidase. The catalytic module is composed of a 5-bladed β-propeller topologically identical to the other family 43 enzymes. The arabinan binding module had three similar subdomains assembled against one another around a pseudo-3-fold axis, forming a β-trefoil-fold. A sugar complex structure with α-1,5-l-arabinofuranotriose revealed three subsites in the catalytic domain, and a sugar complex structure with α-l-arabinofuranosyl azide revealed three arabinose-binding sites in the carbohydrate binding module. A mutagenesis study revealed that substrate specificity was regulated by residues Asn-159, Tyr-192, and Leu-289 located at the aglycon side of the substrate-binding pocket. The exo-acting manner of the enzyme was attributed to the strict pocket structure of subsite −1, formed by the flexible loop region Tyr-281–Arg-294 and the side chain of Tyr-40, which occupied the positions corresponding to the catalytic glycon cleft of GH43 endo-acting enzymes.

Gibeaut D.M. Plant J. 1993; 3: 1-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (2899) Google Scholar). Research on plant cell walls is becoming a necessity because worldwide attention has now focused on bioethanol production to combat global warming and to improve global energy security. Because of competition between food and fuel, lignocellulose is expected to be used as a material for fuel ethanol production in the future. Generally, lignocellulose contains cellulose, which makes up ∼40% of the total amount of cell wall components, together with ∼20% hemicellulose, which is mainly composed of pentoses such as xylose and arabinose (2Saha B.C. J. Ind. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 2003; 30: 279-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (1564) Google Scholar). Hemicelluloses often become bad factors in bioethanol production because the efficiency of ethanol conversion from pentoses is significantly lower than that from hexoses (3Aristidou A. Penttilä M. Curr. Opin. Biotechnol. 2000; 11: 187-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar, 4Skoog K. Hahn-Hägerdal B. Enzyme Microb. Technol. 1988; 10: 66-80Crossref Scopus (161) Google Scholar). In contrast, l-arabinose is used as a functional sugar in the food industry. This sugar has a sweet taste and selectively inhibits intestinal sucrase activity in a noncompetitive manner and consequently suppresses plasma glucose increase due to sucrose ingestion (5Seri K. Sanai K. Matsuo N. Kawakubo K. Xue C. Inoue S. Metabolism. 1996; 45: 1368-1374Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 6Sanai K. Seri K. Inoue S. J. Jpn. Soc. Nutr.

Therefore, l-arabinose may also be useful in preventing excess sucrose utilization. Because the structure of l-arabinose-containing polysaccharides is highly variable and complex, a wide variety of α-l-arabinofuranosidases (EC 3.2.1.55) that have various substrate specificities are necessary for the hydrolysis of such polysaccharides and for the production of l-arabinose. We have previously purified some α-l-arabinofuranosidases and elucidated their substrate specificities toward structurally defined substrates (8Kaneko S. Shimasaki T. Kusakabe I. Biosci. Biotechnol.

The α-l-arabinofuranosidases studied have broad substrate specificities; however, α-l-arabinofuranosidase II from Streptomyces chartreusis (15Matsuo N. Kaneko S. Kuno A. Kobayashi H. Kusakabe I. Biochem. J. 2000; 346: 9-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) has strict substrate specificity. It hydrolyzed only the α-1,5-linkages of linear arabinan and arabinooligosaccharides in an exo-acting manner and was subsequently designated as an exo-1,5-α-l-arabinofuranosidase (15Matsuo N. Kaneko S. Kuno A. Kobayashi H. Kusakabe I. Biochem. J. 2000; 346: 9-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Glycoside hydrolases are classified into 118 families according to the similarity of their amino acid sequences, which imply both structural and mechanistic relationships (16Henrissat B. Biochem. J. 1991; 280: 309-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (2651) Google Scholar, 17Cantarel B.L. Coutinho P.M. Rancurel C. Bernard T. Lombard V. Henrissat B.

The amino acid sequence of exo-1,5-α-l-arabinofuranosidase indicates that it is a novel enzyme belonging to family 43 (GH43) (15Matsuo N. Kaneko S. Kuno A. Kobayashi H. Kusakabe I. Biochem.

GH43 is a family composed of a wide variety of enzymes, including β-xylosidase (EC 3.2.1.37), α-l-arabinofuranosidase (exo-1,5-α-l-arabinofuranosidase), bifunctional β-xylosidase/α-l-arabinofuranosidase, endo-α-l-arabinanase (E.C. 3.2.1.99), endo-β-1,4-xylanase (EC 3.2.1.8), and exo-β-1,3-galactanase (EC 3.2.1.145). Therefore, a detailed functional characterization using a recombinant enzyme with its mutants would be interesting because enzymes belonging to the same family have a common polypeptide folding and identical catalytic mechanism. Especially, a comparison of the structures of exo-1,5-α-l-arabinofuranosidase and endo-α-l-arabinanase will provide difference of the substrate recognition mechanisms of exo- and endo-type enzymes. In the previous work we succeeded in the heterogeneous expression of exo-1,5-α-l-arabinofuanosidase from Streptomyces avermitilis (SaAraf43A) (18Ichinose H. Yoshida M. Fujimoto Z. Kaneko S. Appl. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 2008; 80: 399-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). SaAraf43A is composed of an N-terminal GH43 catalytic domain and a C-terminal carbohydrate binding module family 42 (CBM42) domain. Of enzymes that contain CBM42 domains, Aspergillus kawachii α-l-arabinofuranosidase, which belongs to the GH54 family, has been extensively studied, and its crystal structures have been determined (19Miyanaga A. Koseki T. Matsuzawa H. Wakagi T. Shoun H. Fushinobu S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 44907-44914Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 20Miyanaga A. Koseki T. Miwa Y. Mese Y. Nakamura S. Kuno A. Hirabayashi J. Matsuzawa H. Wakagi T. Shoun H. Fushinobu S. Biochem. J. 2006; 399: 503-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). In this enzyme the CBM42 domain is the substrate recognition domain that specifically binds to l-arabinofuranose. Structural analyses of our enzyme will clarify the function of the CBM42 domain in SaAraf43A. These analyses will also elucidate the efficient catalytic mechanism of the multidomain glycosidase toward the recalcitrant substrate. Given this importance, crystallization trials of SaAraf43A, a modular enzyme of GH43 and CBM42, were performed (21Fujimoto Z. Ichinose H. Kaneko S. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. F Struct. Biol. Cryst. Commun. 2008; 64: 1007-1009Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). In this article we analyzed the crystal structure of SaAraf43A. A mutagenesis study of SaAraf43A provides insights into the mechanism of substrate discrimination between exo- and endo-type enzymes in glycoside hydrolase family 43. p-Nitrophenyl α-l-arabinofuranoside (PNP-α-l-Araf) was purchased from Sigma. α-1,5-l-Arabinofuranooligosaccharides with degrees of polymerization ranging from 2 to 5 were obtained from Megazyme (Wicklow, Ireland). Methyl 2-O-, methyl 3-O-, and methyl 5-O-α-l-arabinofuranosyl-α-l-arabinofuranosides (l-arabinofuranobioses) were prepared as previously reported (22Kawabata Y. Kaneko S. Kusakabe I. Gama Y. Carbohydr. Res. 1995; 267: 39-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). α-l-Arabinofuranosyl azide (ArafαAz) was synthesized as follows. In 50 ml of N,N-dimethylformamide, 5 g of 2,3,6-tribenzoyl-α-l-arabinofuranosyl bromide (23Berlin W. Sauer B. Anal. Biochem. 1996; 243: 171-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) (9.5 mmol) and 5 g of sodium azide (77 mmol) were dissolved, and the reaction was allowed to proceed at 95 °C for 3.5 h. Then the solution was rotoevaporated to remove N,N-dimethylformamide. The residue was dissolved in 100 ml of CH2Cl2, filtrated, washed with aqueous NaHCO3, dried over Na2SO4, and evaporated into syrup. The syrup was then applied to a silica gel dry chromatography (3-cm diameter × 20 cm) with hexane-ethyl acetate (3:2 by volume) as solvent. Fractions containing the main product were collected, and 2,3,6-tribenzoyl-α-l-arabinofuranosyl azide was crystallized from methanol. Finally, 2.2 g of 2,3,6-tribenzoyl-α-l-arabinofuranosyl azide (4.1 mmol, yield 43%) was obtained. NMR δH (in CDCl3): 8.12–7.98 (6H, m, benzoate), 7.64–7.27 (9H, m, benzoate), 5.75 (1H, s, H1), 5.63 (1H, d, J = 4.0 Hz, H3), 5.44 (1H, s, H2), 4.86 (1H, dd J = 3.1, 11.0 Hz, H5), 4.75 (1H, m, H4), 4.71 (1H, dd, J = 5.0, 11.0 Hz H5). Then, 300 mg of 2,3,6-tribenzoyl-α-l-arabinofuranosyl azide (0.62 mmol) was dissolved in 3 ml of MeOH containing a catalytic amount of sodium methoxide and left to stand for 2 h at 25 °C. The solution was then deionized with Dowex 50×, filtered, and evaporated into syrup. The syrup was dissolved in 3 ml of H2O, and the remaining methyl benzoate was extracted with CHCl3 3 times. The aqueous layer was collected and lyophilized to obtain 108 mg of ArafαAz (0.62 mmol, yield 100%) as white powder. Recombinant SaAraf43A was expressed in Escherichia coli BL21gold (DE3) (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) using an expression vector pET30 (Novagen, Madison, WI) purified as described previously (18Ichinose H. Yoshida M. Fujimoto Z. Kaneko S. Appl. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 2008; 80: 399-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Amino acid substitutions of SaAraf43A were generated by inverse PCR using pET30/SaAraf43A as template DNA and the appropriate primers (supplemental Table S1). Mutations were confirmed by DNA sequencing. The plasmids were transformed into E. coli BL21gold (DE3). Expression and purification of wild type and mutants were carried out in the same way as for wild type SaAraf43A (18Ichinose H. Yoshida M. Fujimoto Z. Kaneko S. Appl. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 2008; 80: 399-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Crystallization procedures have been reported previously (21Fujimoto Z. Ichinose H. Kaneko S. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. F Struct. Biol. Cryst. Commun. 2008; 64: 1007-1009Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). SaAraf43A was crystallized by the sitting-drop vapor-diffusion method with the precipitant solution composed of 0.8 m sodium citrate, 0.2 m sodium chloride, and 0.1 m Tris, pH 7.0. Crystals with maximum dimensions of 200 × 50 × 20 μm were consistently obtained using 100 μl of the reservoir solution with a drop consisting of 2–3 μl of protein solution and 2 μl of reservoir solution at 293 K. Selenomethionine (Se-Met)-labeled SaAraf43A was produced using the E. coli B834 (DE3) methionine auxotroph and crystallized in the same condition as with the native enzymes. Diffraction experiments were conducted at Photon Factory, High Energy Accelerator Research Organization, Tsukuba, Japan and at the large synchrotron radiation facility (SPring-8), Japan Synchrotron Radiation Research Institute, Harima, Japan. Approximately equal volumes of the reservoir solution containing 10% glycerol was added into the crystal drop, scooped in a nylon loop, and flash-frozen in a nitrogen stream at 95 K. Diffraction data were collected with ADSC CCD detectors. Data were integrated and scaled using the program DENZO and Scalepack in the HKL2000 program suite (24Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38617) Google Scholar). SaAraf43A crystals diffracted to ∼2.0 Å resolution (space group P212121). Structural analysis of SaAraf43A was conducted through the multiwavelength anomalous dispersion method using Se-Met-labeled SaAraf43A crystals. Four selenium atom positions were determined, and initial phases were calculated using the program SOLVE/RESOLVE (25Terwilliger T.C. Methods Enzymol. 2003; 374: 22-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar). Manual model rebuilding, introduction of water molecules, and molecular refinement were conducted using Coot and Refmac5 (26Emsley P. Cowtan K. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2004; 60: 2126-2132Crossref PubMed Scopus (23628) Google Scholar, 27Murshudov G.N. Vagin A.A. Dodson E.J. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1997; 53: 240-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (13914) Google Scholar). One sodium ion and 1 chloride ion were added into the model. For the analyses of ligand binding structures of SaAraf43A, α-1,5-l-arabinofuranobiose, α-1,5-l-arabinofuranotriose, or ArafαAz was dissolved in the crystallization precipitant to the concentration of 5% (w/v); 1 μl of the ligand solution was added to the crystal drops and incubated for 20–30 min, and the crystals were subjected to diffraction experiments. Structural determination was conducted through the molecular replacement method using the ligand-free structure as the starting model. Data collection and structure refinement statistics are given in Table 1. Structural drawings were prepared by the program PyMol (DeLano Scientific LLC, Palo Alto, CA).TABLE 1Data collection and structure refinement statistics of the SaAraf43ADataNativeSe-Met (peak)Se-Met (low remote)Se-Met (edge)Se-Met (high remote)α-1,5-l-arabinobiose complexα-1,5-l-arabinotriose complexArafαAz complexData collection Unit-cell parameters (Å)a = 41.0a = 41.0a = 41.1a = 41.2a = 41.0b = 91.5b = 90.2b = 91.8b = 91.3b = 89.7c = 135.5c = 135.4c = 135.1c = 136.0c = 135.4 Beam linePF BL6APF BL6APF BL17PF BL17SPring-8 BL41XU Wavelength (Å)0.978000.979340.984000.979660.964000.970000.970000.97915 Resolution (Å)100.0-2.250.0-2.250.0-2.250.0-2.250.0-2.250.0-1.850.0-1.7100.0-2.0(2.28-2.20)(2.28-2.20)(2.28-2.20)(2.28-2.20)(2.28-2.20)(1.86-1.80)(1.76-1.70)(2.07-2.00) Rmerge0.081 (0.285)0.073 (0.225)0.069 (0.221)0.068 (0.234)0.075 (0.235)0.056 (0.267)0.055 (0.257)0.074 (0.281) Completeness (%)97.5 (97.5)99.5 (97.7)99.5 (97.7)99.5 (97.8)99.5 (97.2)99.3 (98.8)97.9 (97.0)99.7 (99.3) Multiplicity7.0 (7.2)13.5 (12.3)13.5 (12.3)13.4 (11.8)13.6 (12.4)13.9 (13.5)14.6 (14.4)8.8 (8.5) Average I/s(I)44.4 (3.1)51.8 (17.5)52.4 (17.1)67.2 (15.7)51.9 (16.4)52.7 (9.6)53.7 (9.5)38.1 (7.5) Unique reflections26,313 (2,601)26,268 (2,528)26,086 (2,511)26,617 (2,528)26,376 (2,529)47,867 (4,726)56,484 (5,492)34,964 (3,416) Observed reflections182,571354,823352,391355,344358,318663,514823,137308,745Structure refinement Resolution (Å)75.8-2.250.0-2.240.42-1.8039.47-1.7074.79-2.00(2.257-2.200)(2.28-2.20)(1.849-1.800)(1.744-1.700)(2.052-2.000) Rwork0.208 (0.304)0.191 (0.240)0.187 (0.259)0.188 (0.263)0.193 (0.244) Rfree0.254 (0.357)0.263 (0.396)0.221 (0.311)0.220 (0.294)0.231 (0.267) r.m.s.d. from idealBond lengths (Å)0.0120.0250.0110.0100.010Bond angles (°)1.3902.1841.2561.2441.216 Open table in a new tab To evaluate the catalytic efficiency of SaAraf43A toward α-1,5-linked l-arabinofuranooligosaccharides such as α-1,5-l-arabinofuranobiose, α-1,5-l-arabinofuranotriose, α-1,5-l-arabinofuranotetraose, and α-1,5-l-arabinofuranopentoase, 0.5 nm enzyme was incubated with 10 μm substrate in McIlvaine buffer (0.2 m Na2HPO4, 0.1 m citric acid), pH 6.0, for up to 120 min at 30 °C. After regular time intervals, 100-μl aliquots were taken, and the reaction was stopped by boiling for 5 min. The amount of each undegraded substrate was quantified by high performance anion-exchange chromatography with pulsed amperometric detection (HPAEC-PAD) using l-fucose as an internal standard, as previously reported (28Ichinose H. Yoshida M. Kotake T. Kuno A. Igarashi K. Tsumuraya Y. Samejima M. Hirabayashi J. Kobayashi H. Kaneko S. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 25820-25829Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Analysis of the samples was performed using CarboPacTM PA1 column (Dionex, Sunnyvale, CA) as described previously (18Ichinose H. Yoshida M. Fujimoto Z. Kaneko S. Appl. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 2008; 80: 399-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Substrate specificity of the mutants was analyzed using methyl 2-O-, 3-O-, and 5-O-α-l-arabinofuranosyl-α-l-arabinofuranosides. Briefly, the enzyme (4 nm–4 μm) was incubated with substrate (10 μm) in McIlvaine buffer, pH 6.0, at 30 °C. After regular time intervals, the reaction was stopped by boiling for 5 min, and then the amounts of undegraded substrate and released l-arabinose were quantified by HPAEC-PAD as described above. The catalytic activity of SaAraf43A and its mutants was assayed using 100 nmol to 1 μmol of enzyme incubated with 0.25–5 mm PNP-α-l-Araf in McIlvaine buffer, pH 6.0, in a total volume of 0.5 ml at 30 °C for up to 30 min. The amount of PNP released was determined at 400 nm with an extinction coefficient of 19,608 m−1 cm−1. The assay was performed in triplicate. The crystal structure of SaAraf43A was determined by the multiwavelength anomalous dispersion method using Se-Met derivative data. Successively, native and three ligand complex structures, SaAraf43A/α-1,5-l-arabinofuranobiose, SaAraf43A/α-1,5-l-arabinofuranotriose, and SaAraf43A/ArafαAz, were determined. Structure refinement statistics are summarized in Table 1. The quality and accuracy of the final structures were further demonstrated in that more than 98% of their residues fall within the common regions of the Ramachandran stereochemistry plot. Recombinant SaAraf43A molecule is composed of a single polypeptide chain of 468 amino acids (0–467), where N-terminal Met-0 and C-terminal 460LEHHHHHH467 were derived from the expression vector and purification tag. The N-terminal 9 residues Met-0—Val-8 and the C-terminal 12 residues Leu-456—His-467 were not identified because of lack of electron density. The final model consisted of 1 SaAraf43A molecule accompanied with 1 sodium ion, 1 chloride ion, and several glycerol molecules. SaAraf43A is composed of 2 distinct domains (Fig. 1). The N-terminal catalytic domain is composed of a 5-bladed β-propeller that is built of 5 radially oriented “blades” (marked here as I-V, Fig. 1A), distributed almost equally around a full circle. Such a fold was first reported for tachylectin (29Beisel H.G. Kawabata S. Iwanaga S. Huber R. Bode W. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2313-2322Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar) and was found in three glycoside hydrolase families, GH32, GH43, and GH68, represented by invertase, α-l-arabinanase, and levansucrase, respectively. The C-terminal domain is made of three repeated-peptide segments referred to as subdomains α, β, and γ (Figs. 1B and 2). A combination of the three subdomains results in a fold similar to the “β-trefoil fold” proposed by Murzin et al. (30Murzin A.G. Lesk A.M. Chothia C. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 223: 531-543Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). The β-trefoil fold is observed in two families, CBM13 and CBM42.FIGURE 2Sequence alignment based on the crystal structures of SaAraf43A with the catalytic domains of other GH43 enzymes and with CBM42 of A. kawachii α-l-arabinofuranosidase (AkCBM42; PDB code ).

Then the structure of the sugar complex was determined. The relative positions of the domains did not change in comparison with the ligand-free structure. In the α-1,5-l-arabinofuranobiose complex, one l-arabinofuranosyl moiety was bound in the catalytic domain and in subdomain γ of the CBM42 domain. On the other hand, two l-arabinose moieties were found in subdomain α of the CBM42 domain. In the α-1,5-l-arabinofuranotriose complex, three l-arabinofuranosyl moieties were observed in the catalytic domain, but two moieties were observed in subdomains α and γ (Fig. 1A). In contrast, in the ArafαAz complex, one molecule was bound in the catalytic domain, and three molecules were found in the CBM42 domain, in all subdomains (Fig. 1B). The C-terminal CBM42 module of SaAraf43A (SaCBM42) consisted of 3 repeated subdomains of ∼50 residues, and 3 subdomains generated a β-trefoil fold (Figs. 1B and 2). The crystal structure of CBM42 had been reported only for the A. kawachii α-l-arabinofuranosidase, which is a modular enzyme consisting of GH54 and CBM42 (AkCBM42) (19Miyanaga A. Koseki T. Matsuzawa H. Wakagi T. Shoun H. Fushinobu S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 44907-44914Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). In AkCBM42, two sugar binding pockets (subdomains β and γ) were active. Comparison of the sugar complex structures showed that the l-arabinose binding structures were conserved in two proteins, and histidine and aspartate residues involved in arabinose binding are strictly conserved among all three subdomains of SaCBM42. However, the bound sugars were observed in only two subdomains α and γ in the α-1,5-l-arabinofuranobiose or α-1,5-l-arabinofuranotriose complex structures (Fig. 1A). In subdomains α and γ of CBM42 of SaAraf43A, two moieties of l-arabinofuranose were observed to look like α-1,5-l-arabinofuranobiose in the α-1,5-l-arabinofuranotriose complex structure (Fig. 3, A and C). The His-336-Nδ1, Asp-352-Oδ1, Asp-352-Oδ2, Asp-338-N, and Phe-339-N atoms in subdomain α hydrogen bonded to the O5, O3, O2, O4, and O3 atoms of the non-reducing-end l-arabinofuranose, respectively (Figs. 3A and 4A). Besides the polar contacts, three aromatic side chains, Trp-337, Phe-339, and Tyr-374, sandwiched this sugar in subdomain α, providing the hydrophobic contact. Tyr-374 was located in subdomain β but participated in van der Waals contact with bound sugars in subdomain α. Similar hydrogen bond network and van der Waals contacts were observed in subdomain γ.FIGURE 4Schematic drawings of the sugar-binding structures in subdomain α of SaCBM42 (A) and catalytic pocket of SaAraf43A (B). Hydrogen bonds between the sugars and proteins were shown as dashed lines with their bond distances (Å). The figure was drawn by the program LIGPLOT (40Wallace A.C. Laskowski R.A. Thornton J.M. Protein Eng. 1995; 8: 127-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (4434) Google Scholar).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The relative positions of the l-arabinofuranosyl moiety at the non-reducing end of the bound sugars and their binding manners were quite conserved between two subdomains as well with those of AkCBM42, whereas the positions of the reducing-end l-arabinofuranosyl moiety differed between the two subdomains. This difference was caused by lesser contacts with the binding site and the close contact with symmetry-related molecules. The electron density for the reducing-end l-arabinofuranose was rather vague, and they were observed to be bound nonspecifically by the crystallographic circumstances. Therefore, the sugar-binding site of SaCBM42 basically recognized only one moiety of α-1,5-l-arabinofuranooligosaccharides. In subdomain β of CBM42, His-381 and Asp-400 hydrogen-bonded to one glycerol molecule (Fig. 3B). This glycerol might have originated from the cryoprotectant. In contrast, in the complex structure with ArafαAz, the bound ArafαAz molecule was observed in subdomain β as well as in subdomains α and γ of SaCBM42. Therefore, subdomain β would have the potential to bind l-arabinooligosaccharides. The side chains of Tyr-431 and Glu-432 in the symmetry-related molecule were considered to prevent the sugars from binding to the crystal through the sugar-soaking method. The binding manner of ArafαAz was similar to those of the other subdomains, and four hydrogen bonds were present between the protein and the sugar (Fig. 3D). The O5 atoms of the bound l-arabinofuranoses were located at the bottom of the binding site, recognized by two hydrogen bonds. That the O5 atom was buried indicated the sugar-binding sites of SaCBM42 specifically recognizes the terminal l-arabinofuranosyl moiety of the l-arabinofuranooligosaccharides and cannot bind the linear 1,5-l-arabinooligosaccharides across the two binding sites. This specificity agreed with the exo-type catalytic mechanism of the enzyme and the binding specificity of SaCBM42 that bound terminal and branched l-arabinofuranosyl residues, such as arabinan and arabinoxylan, described in the previous paper (18Ichinose H. Yoshida M. Fujimoto Z. Kaneko S. Appl. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 2008; 80: 399-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). SaCBM42 would play a role of finding the l-arabinofuranosyl residues among the insoluble substrate and aid catalysis by the catalytic module. CBM13 also has a β-trefoi"

Current binding analyses support a very different mechanism of interaction with the flap substrate. Measurements of FEN1 binding to a flap substrate show that the nuclease binds with similar high affinity to the base of a long flap even when the 5'-end is blocked with biotin/streptavidin. However, FEN1 bound to a blocked flap is more sensitive to sequestration by a competing substrate. These results are consistent with a substrate interaction mechanism in which FEN1 first binds the flap base and then threads the flap through an opening in the protein from the 5'-end to the base for cleavage. Significantly, when the unblocked flap length is reduced from five to two nucleotides, FEN1 can be sequestered from the substrate to a similar extent as a blocked, long flap substrate. Apparently, interactions related to threading occur only when the flap is greater than two to four nucleotides long, implying that short flaps are cleaved without a threading requirement."
https://openalex.org/W1991144057,"In the precedence effect, sounds emanating directly from the source are localized preferentially over their reflections. Although most studies have focused on the delay between the onset of a sound and its echo, humans still experience the precedence effect when this onset delay is removed. We tested in barn owls the hypothesis that an ongoing delay, equivalent to the onset delay, is discernible from the envelope features of amplitude-modulated stimuli and may be sufficient to evoke this effect. With sound pairs having only envelope cues, owls localized direct sounds preferentially, and neurons in their auditory space-maps discharged more vigorously to them, but only if the sounds were amplitude modulated. Under conditions that yielded the precedence effect, acoustical features known to evoke neuronal discharges were more abundant in the envelopes of the direct sounds than of the echoes, suggesting that specialized neural mechanisms for echo suppression were unnecessary."

Transepithelial electrophysiology was used in combination with CFTR-expressing and genetically matched airway epithelial cell lines to test whether 3O-C12 increased CFTR-dependent Cl− secretion. Fluid secretion by submucosal glands in intact pig tracheas was measured to determine whether 3O-C12-stimulated Cl− secretion also contributed to fluid secretion in intact tissues. Cacyto (fura-2 imaging) and CaER (FRET imaging of ER-targeted cameleon) were measured during treatments with 3O-C12 and thapsigargin (selective blocker of Ca2+-ATPase in the ER) to test whether increases in Cacyto resulted from release of Ca2+ from the ER or from some other organelle. Patch clamp electrophysiology of inositol trisphosphate receptor 1 (IP3R1) expressed in the nuclei isolated from chicken B cells (DT40) tested whether decreases in CaER resulted from direct 3O-C12 activation of the IP3R or some other release or uptake mechanism. Total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) imaging was used to measure activation of STIM1, the key ER protein that has been proposed to mediate reductions in CaER to activation of cAMP production (15Lefkimmiatis K. Srikanthan M. Maiellaro I. Moyer M.P. Curci S. Hofer A.M. Nat. Cell Biol. 2009; 11: 433-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). The role of cAMP in the Cl− secretory response was tested by measuring cAMP with Epac H30 FRET imaging and then by testing inhibitors that increase [cAMP] (phosphodiesterase blocker) and inhibit protein kinase A (Rp)-cAMP. Finally, cAMP and Cl− secretion were measured in cells treated with the membrane-permeant ER Ca2+ buffer TPEN to determine whether specific reductions in CaER (i.e. without altering Cacyto) would increase cAMP and activate Cl− secretion.

Thus, 3O-C12 appears to stimulate proinflammatory responses on its own but inhibit responses when present with other proinflammatory agonists.The goals of this study were to determine the effects of 3O-C12 on Cl− secretion by airway epithelia, the role for CFTR in this secretion, and whether Ca2+ and cAMP signaling were involved. 3O-C12 increases cytosolic [Ca2+] (Cacyto) in fibroblasts (7Shiner E.K.

If 3O-C12 elicited similar effects in airway epithelia, 3O-C12 might also raise cAMP by an ER store-operated cAMP mechanism recently described for colonic epithelial cells; Lefkimmiatis (15Lefkimmiatis K.

Transepithelial electrophysiology was used in combination with CFTR-expressing and genetically matched airway epithelial cell lines to test whether 3O-C12 increased CFTR-dependent Cl− secretion. Fluid secretion by submucosal glands in intact pig tracheas was measured to determine whether 3O-C12-stimulated Cl− secretion also contributed to fluid secretion in intact tissues. Cacyto (fura-2 imaging) and CaER (FRET imaging of ER-targeted cameleon) were measured during treatments with 3O-C12 and thapsigargin (selective blocker of Ca2+-ATPase in the ER) to test whether increases in Cacyto resulted from release of Ca2+ from the ER or from some other organelle. Patch clamp electrophysiology of inositol trisphosphate receptor 1 (IP3R1) expressed in the nuclei isolated from chicken B cells (DT40) tested whether decreases in CaER resulted from direct 3O-C12 activation of the IP3R or some other release or uptake mechanism. Total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) imaging was used to measure activation of STIM1, the key ER protein that has been proposed to mediate reductions in CaER to activation of cAMP production (15Lefkimmiatis K. Srikanthan M. Maiellaro I. Moyer M.P. Curci S. Hofer A.M. Nat. Cell Biol. 2009; 11: 433-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). The role of cAMP in the Cl− secretory response was tested by measuring cAMP with Epac H30 FRET imaging and then by testing inhibitors that increase [cAMP] (phosphodiesterase blocker) and inhibit protein kinase A (Rp)-cAMP. Finally, cAMP and Cl− secretion were measured in cells treated with the membrane-permeant ER Ca2+ buffer TPEN to determine whether specific reductions in CaER (i.e. without altering Cacyto) would increase cAMP and activate Cl− secretion."

https://openalex.org/W1987552932,"Collagen and fibronectin (FN) are two abundant and essential components of the vertebrate extracellular matrix; they interact directly with cellular receptors and affect cell adhesion and migration. Past studies identified a FN fragment comprising six modules, (6)FnI(1-2)FnII(7-9)FnI, and termed the gelatin binding domain (GBD) as responsible for collagen interaction. Recently, we showed that the GBD binds tightly to a specific site within type I collagen and determined the structure of domains (8-9)FnI in complex with a peptide from that site. Here, we present the crystallographic structure of domains (6)FnI(1-2)FnII(7)FnI, which form a compact, globular unit through interdomain interactions. Analysis of NMR titrations with single-stranded collagen peptides reveals a dominant collagen interaction surface on domains (2)FnII and (7)FnI; a similar surface appears involved in interactions with triple-helical peptides. Models of the complete GBD, based on the new structure and the (8-9)FnI·collagen complex show a continuous putative collagen binding surface. We explore the implications of this model using long collagen peptides and discuss our findings in the context of FN interactions with collagen fibrils."

With respect to the outside-in signaling, the important unanswered questions center on selective recognition of proximal effectors by integrin cytoplasmic domains at different stages of cell spreading. Phosphorylation of the integrin tails is considered to be one of the spatiotemporal mechanisms for imparting such selectivity and, indeed, phosphorylation switches are thought to be a common principle of integrin regulation. Platelet integrin β3 cytoplasmic tail (CT) is laden with various phosphorylation sites, including two tyrosines, one serine, and multiple threonines. However, only tyrosine phosphorylation is found to be specific for the outside-in signaling (4Schaffner-Reckinger E. Gouon V. Melchior C. Plançon S. Kieffer N. J. Biol.

Oncogene. 2001; 20: 6322-6330Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). In the context of the present study, it is important to mention that Shc has also been coupled to the integrin controlled cell cycle progression (11Wary K.K. Mainiero F. Isakoff S.J. Marcantonio E.E. Giancotti F.G. Cell. 1996; 87: 733-743Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (654) Google Scholar). One of the three isoforms, the p52 Shc contains three distinct domains: phosphotyrosine-binding (PTB) domain, a poorly characterized glycine/proline-rich region termed as collagen homology domain (CH1), and the SH2 domain. Previous studies have shown that two of these domains, PTB and SH2, could potentially interact with β3CT containing phosphorylated tyrosines (12Zhou M.M. Ravichandran K.S. Olejniczak E.F. Petros A.M.

However, based on in vitro peptide affinity chromatography assays, Higashi et al. (14Higashi T. Yoshioka A. Shirakawa R. Tabuchi A. Nishioka H. Kita T. Horiuchi H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2004; 322: 700-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (1) Google Scholar) proved that p52 Shc binds to the tyrosine-phosphorylated β3 peptide through its PTB domain. Overall, PTB domains comprise a large family of protein binding modules, which exhibit a conserved structural architecture similar to the pleckstrin homology (PH) domains (also termed as PH domain superfold) consisting of a core β-sandwich made of two anti-parallel β sheets flanked by a C-terminal helix. In terms of the PTB domain ligand specificity, although phosphorylated tyrosine is required for high affinity binding in case of proteins such as Shc PTB, IRS-1/IRS-2/IRS-3, Dok1, and SNT/FRS2, the PTB domains of Dab1/Dab2, ARH, Fe65, ICAP1α, JIP-1/JIP-1b, Numb, Talin, and X11α exhibit similar or in some cases even higher affinity for non-phosphorylated peptides (15DiNitto J.P. Lambright D.G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2006; 1761: 850-867Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). For Shc PTB-integrin interaction, a bi-phosphorylated (pY747 and pY759) peptide has been shown to have greater binding affinity than a mono-phosphorylated (pY759) peptide (8Cowan K.J. Law D.A. Phillips D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 36423-36429Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). However, the exact structural basis underlying the second phosphotyrosine-binding site in a canonical PTB domain is not clearly understood. Pathologically, Shc phosphorylation is linked to the stimulation of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) production in tumors (16De S. Razorenova O. McCabe N.P. O'Toole T. Qin J. Byzova T.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2005; 102: 7589-7594Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Thus, deciphering the molecular details of this interaction may influence the development of new anti-cancer therapeutic strategies. Here we present the NMR-derived atomic view of how tyrosine phosphorylation affects β3CT interaction with Shc PTB, and we show for the first time a high resolution three-dimensional structure of Shc PTB domain in complex with bi-phosphorylated integrin β3CT peptide. Cloning, expression, and purification of β3CT have been described previously (2Vinogradova O. Velyvis A. Velyviene A. Hu B. Haas T. Plow E. Qin J. Cell. 2002; 110: 587-597Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar). Tyrosine phosphorylation was achieved in vivo by expressing β3CT in TKB1 cell line from Stratagene. Details of this procedure and purification are described elsewhere. 3O. Vinogradova, manuscript submitted. The Shc PTB domain (residues 17–207, see Fig. 1A) containing pET15b vector, generously provided by Dr. Zhou, was expressed in Rosetta (DE3) cell line from Novagen to improve the expression levels. These cells express rare tRNAs facilitating the translation of genes that encode rare Escherichia coli codons. Purification of Shc PTB domain was performed according to the protocol from Qiagen under nondenaturing conditions followed by gel-filtration on HiLoad 16/60 Superdex 75 column in 50 mm Na2HPO4, 50 mm NaCl, 5 mm DTT buffer at pH 6.5. Short tyrosine(s)-phosphorylated peptides corresponding to mono- and bi-phosphorylated β3CT, MPNβ3, MPCβ3, and BPβ3 Peptide (Fig. 1B), were chemically synthesized (Genemed Synthesis, Inc.; NEO-peptides, Inc.). The heteronuclear NMR experiments were performed on uniformly 15N and/or 13C labeled, ∼0.5 mm Shc PTB samples (unless mentioned otherwise), with or without the ligands/peptides on Varian Inova 600 MHz equipped with inverse-triple resonance cold probe at 35 °C. The samples were prepared in pH 6.5 (unless mentioned otherwise) buffer containing 50 mm Na2HPO4, 50 mm NaCl, 5 mm DTT, 7% D2O, and 1 mm DSS acting as an internal standard. Chemical shift titration experiments between 15N-labeled full-length β3 CTs and non-labeled Shc PTB and 15N-labeled Shc PTB and non-labeled full-length β3 CTs were performed at pH 6.1 to avoid precipitation of β3 CT.

For Shc PTB-BPβ3Peptide complex (1:2 ratio), the backbone and side chain 1H, 15N, 13C resonance assignments were made by using the standard triple resonance NMR experiments, namely HNCA, HNCACB, HNCO, HBHA(CO)NH, and HNCACO. The intra-molecular NOE distance restraints were obtained from 13C- and 15N-edited three-dimensional NOESY-HSQC experiments and 13C-edited aromatic three-dimensional NOESY-HSQC experiments (mixing time 150 ms). The inter-molecular NOE distance restraints between Shc PTB and BPβ3Peptide were obtained from F1 13C,15N-filtered, F2 13C-edited NOESY-HSQC spectrum (18Ikura M. Clore G.M. Gronenborn A.M. Zhu G.

Steady-state heteronuclear 1H-15N NOE values were determined from spectra recorded with 5 s relaxation delay and the presence and absence of a proton presaturation period of 5 s. T1, T2, and NOE values were extracted by a curve-fitting subroutine included in the CCPN software suite (22Vranken W.F. Boucher W. Stevens T.J. Fogh R.H. Pajon A. Llinas M. Ulrich E.L. Markley J.L. Ionides J. Laue E.D. Proteins. 2005; 59: 687-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (2273) Google Scholar). For curve fitting analysis, the spectra were processed with 10 Hz exponential broadening in direct dimension and zero-filled to 2048 × 1024 data points in t2 and t1, respectively. To introduce a spin label, a new peptide, BPβ3Cys, was chemically synthesized (NEO-peptides, Inc.) with an additional cysteine residue at the C terminus (Fig. 1B). A typical spin labeling reaction involved 50 mm Na2HPO4, 50 mm NaCl at pH 6.5, ∼0.4 mm BPβ3Cys, and ∼5 mm cysteine-specific spin label, 3-maleimido-PROXYL (Sigma-Aldrich), hereafter referred to as mProxyl. The reaction was allowed to proceed for 1 h at room temperature. The unreacted mProxyl was then removed from mProxyl-BPβ3Cys by using combination of gel-filtration chromatography on HiLoad 16/60 Superdex 75 column in 50 mm Na2HPO4, 50 mm NaCl at pH 6.5 and reverse phase HPLC on PROTO C4 column (The Nest Group, Inc.). 15N HSQC spectrum was collected on sample containing 0.18 mm spin-labeled peptide (mProxyl-BPβ3Cys) mixed with 0.1 mm 15N Shc PTB in 50 mm Na2HPO4, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm TCEP, 7% D2O, 1 mm DSS buffer at pH 6.5 and 35 °C. An additional 15N HSQC spectrum on the 15N-labeled Shc PTB: BPβ3Cys (same concentration and in same buffer as the paramagnetic sample) was collected for comparison. The 1H,15N resonance assignments of Shc PTB were modified to match these experimental conditions. For calculating the intensity ratios, again the spectra were processed with 10 Hz exponential broadening in direct dimension and zero-filled to 2048 × 1024 data points in t2 and t1, respectively. The backbone, φ and ψ, dihedral angle restraints were obtained by using Talos+ (24Shen Y. Delaglio F. Cornilescu G. Bax A. J. Biomol.

Hydrogen bond restraints were introduced during the final stages of calculations based on secondary structure elements identified from previous rounds of structure calculations. Eighty lowest energy structures from CYANA were then subjected to molecular dynamics simulations in explicit water (26Linge J.P. Williams M.A. Spronk C.A. Bonvin A.M. Nilges M.

Open table in a new tab Previous biochemical studies have indicated that p52 isoform of Shc co-immunoprecipitates with tyrosine-phosphorylated αΙΙbβ3 from the aggregated platelets and that Shc itself gets tyrosine phosphorylated during platelet aggregation (6Phillips D.R. Prasad K.S. Manganello J. Bao M. Nannizzi-Alaimo L. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 546-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). This p52 isoform of Shc binds to the tyrosine-phosphorylated β3 peptide through its PTB domain (14Higashi T. Yoshioka A. Shirakawa R. Tabuchi A. Nishioka H. Kita T. Horiuchi H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2004; 322: 700-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (1) Google Scholar) and phosphorylation of Tyr759 of β3CT is essential to meditate this interaction as only the peptides containing pY759 have shown affinity toward GST-fused Shc (8Cowan K.J. Law D.A. Phillips D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 36423-36429Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). To further confirm and structurally characterize these findings, we have employed Nuclear Magnetic Resonance spectroscopy (NMR). To pinpoint the residues/regions involved in the Shc PTB-β3CT interaction, we began with the chemical shift mapping experiments. Non-labeled Shc PTB domain was mixed with 15N-labeled non-phosphorylated β3CT (hereafter referred to as β3NP), Tyr747 mono-phosphorylated β3CT (hereafter referred to as β3MP) and 747Y-759Y bi-phosphorylated β3CT (hereafter referred to as β3BP) at the ratio 2:1 and the associated chemical shifts perturbations were monitored (expanded regions of superimposed HSQC spectra are shown in Fig. 2: (A) β3NP; (B) β3MP, and (C) β3BP). As expected, Shc PTB addition had no effect on HSQC spectrum of β3NP. In contrast, both β3MP and β3BP HSQC spectra show significant differential line-broadening and several peaks disappearance along with some small shifts in resonance frequencies upon addition of Shc PTB (with an exception of the very last C-terminal residue Thr762 of β3BP, which demonstrates substantial chemical shift, Fig. 2C). This phenomenon is probably due to the intermediate exchange between free and bound states of β3MP and β3BP (28Matsuo H. Walters K.J. Teruya K. Tanaka T. Gassner G.T. Lippard S.J. Kyogoku Y. Wagner G. J. Am Chem. Soc. 1999; : 9903-9904Crossref Scopus (88) Google Scholar) combined with relatively large molecular weight of the complex (about 33 kDa complex versus 8 kDa for β3CT alone). The ratio of the peak intensities along with chemical shifts perturbations for β3MP and β3BP residues plotted as a function of residue numbers is shown in Fig. 2, D and E, respectively. Combination of the differential line broadenings and chemical shift perturbations suggests the regions involved in interaction between phosphorylated β3CT and Shc PTB, namely (i) residues from Asp740 to Ala750, surrounding 744NPLpY747 motif, in case of β3MP, and (ii) almost the entire C terminus, extending from Asp740 to Gly762 and encompassing both 744NPLpY747 and 756NITpY759 motifs plus the region connecting them in case of β3BP. Because the affected region for β3BP upon Shc PTB addition is much broader than the one for β3MP, it can be argued that the binding site around 744NPLpY747 motif is a complimentary one and serves to stabilize β3CT orientation within the complex which has been defined by the primary binding site around 756NITpY759 motif. To confirm the hypothesis that 756NITpY759 motif occupies the canonical PTB site and to map the residues involved from Shc PTB side, we performed similar chemical shift mapping experiments. Non-labeled β3NP, β3MP, β3BP solutions were mixed with 15N-labeled Shc PTB at the ratio 2:1. The superimposition of expanded regions of HSQC spectra for 15N-labeled Shc PTB mixed with β3 NP, MP, BP is depicted in Fig. 3A (Shc PTB alone is shown in black; with β3NP, in blue; β3MP, in red; and β3BP, in lime; the superimposition of entire spectra is presented in supplemental Fig. S1A). As predicted, there were no changes in the 15N-labeled Shc PTB HSQC spectrum upon addition of the full-length non-labeled β3NP. Addition of β3MP to 15N-labeled Shc PTB leads to several small shifts in resonance frequencies as well as appearance of few additional (doublet) weak peaks probably representing a small population of protein in bound conformation. In contrast, there are significant changes in HSQC spectrum of Shc PTB upon addition of β3BP indicating substantial conformational rearrangement of Shc PTB, a hallmark of Shc PTB domain (17Farooq A. Zeng L. Yan K.S. Ravichandran K.S. Zhou M.M. Structure. 2003; 11: 905-913Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). However, low mutual solubility of Shc PTB and full-length β3CT constructs prevented us from conducting a full scale, thorough NMR structural investigation of Shc PTB-β3BP interaction. To circumvent the solubility issue and to understand this interaction in atomic details, we have synthesized three phosphorylated tyrosines containing peptides representing different regions of the full-length β3CT, which are involved in interaction with Shc PTB (Fig. 1B). Similar chemical shift mapping experiments were performed on 15N-labeled Shc PTB mixed with non-labeled N-terminal mono-phosphorylated peptide, MPNβ3, C-terminal mono-phosphorylated peptide, MPCβ3, and C-terminal bi-phosphorylated peptide, BPβ3Peptide. Chemical shifts perturbations were monitored and are depicted in Fig. 3B (superimposition of the full spectra is presented in supplemental Fig. S1B). The outcome appeared to be very similar to the full-length β3CT titrations. (The complete chemical shift perturbations, i.e. 15N-labeled Shc PTB + non-labeled MPNβ3, MPCβ3, BPβ3Peptide, are presented in supplemental Fig. S1C). Addition of MPNβ3, containing pY747, leads to small shifts in Shc amide resonance frequencies together with an appearance of several weak doublet peaks. Based upon this observation, we can suggest that in the absence of pY759, pY747 may occupy the orthodox PTB site. However, its higher dissociation rate may prevent the stabilization of the structural rearrangement in Shc PTB. In contrast, addition of MPCβ3, containing pY759, as well as addition of BPβ3Peptide, containing both pY759 and pY747, to Shc PTB results in significant perturbations in Shc PTB HSQC spectrum. Overall, these perturbations resemble very closely to the ones found in Shc PTB-TrkA complex (17Farooq A. Zeng L. Yan K.S. Ravichandran K.S. Zhou M.M. Structure. 2003; 11: 905-913Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) representing a very well established conformational rearrangement of Shc PTB upon ligand binding. Surprisingly and on a more important note, these titration experiments indicated that although MPCβ3 alone is sufficient to induce the classical conformational change in Shc PTB, similar or even the greater conformational rearrangement is achieved via addition of BPβ3Peptide. Fig. 3C depicts these crucial differences in chemical shifts perturbations between MPCβ3 versus BPβ3Peptide plotted as a function of Shc PTB residue number, which provides us with the essential information about the possible binding site for the 744NPLpY747 motif. Explicitly, three Shc PTB regions are particularly different: (a) residues 78T–E80 of the helix α2, (b) residues Arg104 and Leu106 of the long loop connecting helix α2 and strand β2 and (c) residues 159D–V164 of the loop connecting strand β5-β6. Mapping these regions on the available Shc PTB structure (PDB ID: 1SHC) (12Zhou M.M. Ravichandran K.S. Olejniczak E.F. Petros A.M. Meadows R.P. Sattler M. Harlan J.E. Wade W.S. Burakoff S.J. Fesik S.W. Nature. 1995; 378: 584-592Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar) suggests that accommodation of 744NPLpY747 motif requires some movement of the helix α2 and the flexible loop connecting α2 to β3 strand. To conclude, our titrations results are in good correlation with Cowan et al. (8Cowan K.J. Law D.A. Phillips D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 36423-36429Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) demonstrating that the phosphorylation of Tyr759 β3CT is essential to meditate direct integrin interaction with Shc PTB except that the NMR methods have allowed us to observe a weak interaction between Shc PTB and β3 peptides containing only pY747, which the biochemical assays could not detect. Based upon our titration experiments, we could predict the possible mode of interaction of Shc PTB with BPβ3Peptide (27 residues, Fig. 1B): positively charged side-chain of Arg104 forming a salt-bridge with negatively charged phosphate group of pY747 whereas pY759 occupying the canonical PTB site. To fully characterize this interaction at atomic level, we have determined the three-dimensional solution structure of Shc PTB-BPβ3Peptide complex using modern triple resonance NMR methods (described in details under “Experimental Procedures”). Inter-molecular NOEs were paramount in defining the orientation of BPβ3Peptide within the complex, which was later in"

We generated wild-type (WT) and mutant murine PDZ1 domains, the mutants bearing single amino acid substitutions in their carboxylate binding loop (Lys14-Xaa4-Asn19-Tyr-Gly-Phe-Phe-Leu24), and measured their binding affinity for a 7-residue peptide corresponding to the C terminus of SR-BI (503VLQEAKL509). The Y20A and G21Y substitutions abrogated all binding activity. Surprisingly, binding affinities (Kd) of the K14A and F22A mutants were 3.2 and 4.0 μm, respectively, similar to 2.6 μm measured for the WT PDZ1. To understand these findings, we determined the high resolution structure of WT PDZ1 bound to a 5-residue sequence from the C-terminal SR-BI (505QEAKL509) using x-ray crystallography. In addition, we incorporated the K14A and Y20A substitutions into full-length PDZK1 liver-specific transgenes and expressed them in WT and PDZK1 knock-out mice. In WT mice, the transgenes did not alter endogenous hepatic SR-BI protein expression (intracellular distribution or amount) or lipoprotein metabolism (total plasma cholesterol, lipoprotein size distribution). In PDZK1 knock-out mice, as expected, the K14A mutant behaved like wild-type PDZK1 and completely corrected their hepatic SR-BI and plasma lipoprotein abnormalities. Unexpectedly, the 10–20-fold overexpressed Y20A mutant also substantially, but not completely, corrected these abnormalities. The results suggest that there may be an additional site(s) within PDZK1 that bind(s) SR-BI and mediate(s) productive SR-BI-PDZK1 interaction previously attributed exclusively to the canonical binding of the C-terminal SR-BI to PDZ1.

IntroductionProtein interaction domains fold into stable, at least partially autonomously functioning, modular domains that mediate a wide variety of protein-protein interactions and appear to have played major roles in evolution. One of the most abundant of such domains in mammals is the PDZ (PSD-95/Discs-large/ZO-1) family of domains, with more than 250 members found in over 100 proteins in the human genome (1van Ham M. Hendriks W. Mol. Biol. Rep. 2003; 30: 69-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). PDZ domains are composed of ∼80–100 amino acids and fold into compact globular structures that usually contain six β-strands and two α-helices (2Doyle D.A. Lee A. Lewis J. Kim E. Sheng M. MacKinnon R. Cell. 1996; 85: 1067-1076Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (958) Google Scholar). PDZ domains often interact with the five C-terminal amino acids of their binding partners (target peptides), and the C-terminal residue is often hydrophobic, although some can interact with as many as seven residues of the C terminus of their targets (3Tonikian R. Zhang Y. Sazinsky S.L. Currell B. Yeh J.H. Reva B. Held H.A. Appleton B.A. Evangelista M. Wu Y. Xin X. Chan A.C. Seshagiri S. Lasky L.A. Sander C. Boone C. Bader G.D. Sidhu S.S. PLoS Biol. 2008; 6: e239Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). Many PDZ domain-containing proteins have multiple PDZ domains and thus can promote clustering or scaffolding of target proteins and can be involved in a wide variety of cellular functions (4Pawson T. Scott J.D. Science. 1997; 278: 2075-2080Crossref PubMed Scopus (1887) Google Scholar).One such multifunctional protein is PDZK1 (5Kocher O. Comella N. Tognazzi K. Brown L.F. Lab. Invest. 1998; 78: 117-125PubMed Google Scholar). PDZK1, a four PDZ domain-containing protein, is involved in the regulation of several membrane-associated proteins such as ion channels and cell-surface receptors (6Seidler U. Singh A. Chen M.

For example, PDZK1 plays a key role as a tissue-specific adaptor that controls the hepatic activity of the high density lipoprotein (HDL) receptor called scavenger receptor class B, type I (SR-BI) 3The abbreviations used are: SR-BIscavenger receptor class B type IKOknock-outCBLcarboxylate binding loopITCisothermal titration calorimetryTgtransgene.

Miettinen H.E. Krieger M. Endocr. Rev. 2003; 24: 357-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). SR-BI, which mediates the binding of HDL and other lipoproteins to cells and the consequent transfer of cholesterol, is most highly expressed in the liver and steroidogenic tissues, and it can be found in a variety of other tissues and cells (e.g. macrophages and endothelial cells). In addition to transporting cholesterol between lipoproteins and cells, SR-BI can function as a signaling receptor in endothelial cells, mediating the activation of intracellular signaling pathways in response to extracellular HDL (11Assanasen C.

Subsequent studies in transgenic and knock-out (KO) mice have established that PDZK1 has a profound influence on SR-BI protein expression and function in some tissues and that it is a tissue-specific adaptor for SR-BI (9Kocher O.

In mice with homozygous inactivation of the PDZK1 gene (PDZK1 KO mice), there is a 95% decrease of expression of SR-BI protein in hepatocytes, a 50% reduction in small intestinal mucosa, but no change in the steroidogenic cells of the adrenal cortex, testes, or ovaries (9Kocher O.

The dramatic reduction in hepatic SR-BI protein expression in PDZK1 KO mice leads to an ∼70% increase in total plasma cholesterol in the form of abnormally large HDL particles, a phenotype similar to but not as severe as that in SR-BI KO mice (9Kocher O.

Indeed, normal expression of PDZK1 is athero- and cardio-protective in the apoE KO mouse model of atherosclerosis, presumably because it is necessary for normal hepatic SR-BI expression (24Kocher O.

Krieger M. Kocher O. PLoS ONE. 2009; 4: e8103Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar).The detailed mechanism by which PDZK1 controls hepatic SR-BI protein expression has not been fully elucidated. Studies in PDZK1 KO mice have shown that the influence of PDZK1 on hepatic SR-BI is post-transcriptional (9Kocher O. Yesilaltay A. Cirovic C. Pal R. Rigotti A. Krieger M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 52820-52825Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar) and that PDZK1 influences its intracellular distribution as well as the steady-state levels of hepatic SR-BI in vivo (9Kocher O.

Hepatic transgenic overexpression experiments involving serial C-terminal truncation mutants of PDZK1 have shown that all four PDZ domains of PDZK1 are necessary for normal hepatic expression, localization, and function of SR-BI (26Fenske S.A. Yesilaltay A. Pal R. Daniels K. Barker C. Quiñones V. Rigotti A. Krieger M. Kocher O. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 5797-5806Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), although previous studies suggested that SR-BI interacts directly with only its PDZ1 domain (23Ikemoto M. Arai H. Feng D. Tanaka K. Aoki J. Dohmae N. Takio K. Adachi H. Tsujimoto M. Inoue K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2000; 97: 6538-6543Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar).Here, we have examined further the role of the PDZ1 domain in PDZK1 control of hepatic SR-BI protein expression and function in vitro and in vivo. We generated recombinant PDZ1 domains, wild-type and mutants carrying single amino acid substitutions in the PDZ1 carboxylate binding loop (CBL) (Lys14-Xaa4-Asn19-Tyr-Gly-Phe-Phe-Leu24), that were designed to interfere with PDZ1-SR-BI target peptide binding. We used isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) to measure SR-BI target peptide (503VLQEAKL509) binding to these recombinant proteins. We also determined the high resolution crystal structure of wild-type PDZ1 bound to its SR-BI target peptide to better understand the interaction and the effects of the amino acid substitutions on target peptide binding in vitro (two mutations abrogated binding and two had little effect). We incorporated two of the PDZ1 single residue substitutions, K14A (essentially normal target peptide binding, PDZK1(K14A)) and Y20A (no binding, PDZK1(Y20A)) into full-length PDZK1 expression constructs and used them to generate transgenic WT and PDZK1 KO mice with liver-specific expression of the transgenes. Unexpectedly, analysis of hepatic SR-BI protein expression (intracellular distribution and amount) and lipoprotein metabolism (total plasma cholesterol and plasma lipoprotein size distribution) in these and control animals suggests that interruption of SR-BI binding to PDZ1 only partially interferes with the ability of overexpressed PDZK1 to control SR-BI expression and lipoprotein metabolism. Thus, PDZK1 may have one or more binding sites for SR-BI in addition to the canonical site on PDZ1.DISCUSSIONPDZK1 is a four PDZ domain containing the tissue-specific adaptor of the HDL receptor SR-BI (9Kocher O.

Absence of PDZK1 in PDZK1 KO mice dramatically reduces hepatic levels of SR-BI protein and, similar to the case of SR-BI KO mice, results in increased plasma cholesterol and an altered lipoprotein distribution with abnormally large HDL particles (9Kocher O.

Because of their important roles in lipoprotein metabolism, SR-BI and PDZK1 are atheroprotective (17Braun A. Trigatti B.L. Post M.J. Sato K. Simons M. Edelberg J.M. Rosenberg R.D. Schrenzel M.

PLoS ONE. 2009; 4: e8103Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The only direct interaction between these two molecules responsible for the influence of PDZK1 on SR-BI has been assumed to be via the binding of the cytoplasmic C-terminal tail of SR-BI (target peptide) to the first PDZ domain of PDZK1 (PDZ1) (23Ikemoto M. Arai H. Feng D. Tanaka K. Aoki J. Dohmae N. Takio K. Adachi H. Tsujimoto M. Inoue K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2000; 97: 6538-6543Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 36Silver D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 34042-34047Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). As expected, hepatic overexpression of the PDZ1 domain alone produces a dominant negative phenotype (26Fenske S.A. Yesilaltay A. Pal R. Daniels K. Barker C. Quiñones V. Rigotti A. Krieger M. Kocher O. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 5797-5806Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Studies in which PDZK1 transgenes with nested C-terminal deletions were expressed in the livers of PDZK1 KO mice have shown that all four PDZ domains of PDZK1 are necessary to restore normal expression, localization, and function of SR-BI in these mice (26Fenske S.A. Yesilaltay A. Pal R. Daniels K. Barker C. Quiñones V. Rigotti A. Krieger M. Kocher O. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 5797-5806Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). However, the precise functions of the second, third, and fourth PDZ domains of PDZK1 are unclear.Using ITC, we have demonstrated that a seven residue peptide with the sequence of the C terminus of SR-BI binds with high affinity (Kd = 2.6 μm) to a recombinant, purified wild-type PDZ1 domain of PDZK1. We also prepared four mutant PDZ1 domains with individual amino acid substitutions at one of four conserved residues in the carboxylate binding loop as follows: K14A, Y20A, G21Y, or F22A. The Y20A and G21Y substitutions completely blocked binding of the SR-BI target peptide, whereas the K14A and F22A substitutions had very little influence on the binding (Fig. 2).To understand the structural bases of these results, we determined the high resolution crystal structure of a chimeric recombinant protein including residues 7–106 of wild-type PDZK1 (residues 7–86 compose PDZ1) whose C terminus was extended by addition of the five C-terminal residues of its target peptide on SR-BI, 505QEAKL509. In the crystals, the SR-BI target peptide from one molecule binds in the peptide binding pocket of the PDZ1 portion of an adjacent molecule, resulting in an infinite chain of head-to-tail molecules. The overall fold of the PDZ1 domain and many of the interactions between the PDZ1 domain and its target peptide were similar to those reported previously for a variety of PDZ domains (2Doyle D.A. Lee A. Lewis J. Kim E. Sheng M. MacKinnon R. Cell. 1996; 85: 1067-1076Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (958) Google Scholar, 37Birrane G. Chung J. Ladias J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 1399-1402Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 41Karthikeyan S. Leung T. Ladias J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 18973-18978Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), with the PDZ1 carboxylate binding loop playing a critical role in binding the target peptide.Analysis of the structure suggested that the K14A substitution did not dramatically influence binding because an alternative positively charged side chain (Arg76) would be able to stabilize the binding of the negatively charged carboxylate of the C-terminal Leu (Leu0) on the target peptide. The structure also indicated that the F22A substitution was unlikely to substantially alter either the conformation of the portions of PDZ1 that hydrogen bond to the target peptide or the characteristics of the hydrophobic pocket into which the aliphatic side chain of the target peptide 0Leu binds. This may be because the hydrophobic side chains of other residues that line the pocket can compensate for the substitution of the Phe22 side chain by the methyl group of Ala. In contrast, the G21Y substitution is predicted to dramatically alter the conformation of the carboxylate binding loop, in part because the bulky aromatic side chain of Tyr cannot be accommodated in the structure without forcing the backbone of the carboxylate binding loop to move relative to the rest of the protein and the target peptide-binding site, and thus prevent target peptide binding to this critical region. The G21Y substitution might also reduce the flexibility of the carboxylate binding loop, and flexibility in this loop due to the presence of Gly21 has been proposed to contribute to the ability of PDZ domains to bind their target peptides (2Doyle D.A. Lee A. Lewis J. Kim E. Sheng M. MacKinnon R. Cell. 1996; 85: 1067-1076Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (958) Google Scholar). Similarly, the structure suggests that the Y20A substitution may abrogate target peptide binding because the side chain of Tyr20 appears to help orient the CBL backbone for optimal target peptide binding. Indeed, the amino group of Tyr20 and the adjacent amino group of Gly21 directly hydrogen bond to the target peptide (FIGURE 1, FIGURE 5).The identification of a single amino acid substitution, Y20A, in PDZ1 that abrogates binding to the C terminus of SR-BI yet does not dramatically alter the conformation of the domain as assessed by circular dichroism opened the possibility of directly assessing the significance of this binding interaction in vivo. We incorporated the Tyr20 to Ala substitution (PDZK1(Y20A)), as well as a control K14A substitution (essentially normal target peptide binding, PDZK1(K14A)) into full-length PDZK1 expression constructs, and we used them to generate transgenic WT and PDZK1 KO mice with liver-specific transgene expression and control nontransgenic mice. As expected (27Fenske S.A. Yesilaltay A. Pal R. Daniels K. Rigotti A. Krieger M. Kocher O. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 22097-22104Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), in WT mice, the transgenes did not interfere with endogenous hepatic SR-BI protein expression (amounts, localization to sinusoidal plasma membrane) nor with lipoprotein metabolism, as assessed by total plasma cholesterol measurements and determination of lipoprotein size distributions by FPLC. Also as expected, hepatic transgenic expression in PDZK1 KO mice of the PDZK1(K14A) protein (substitution does not alter target peptide binding to PDZ1) was able to restore essentially normal hepatic SR-BI protein expression and lipoprotein metabolism (WT plasma cholesterol levels and WT-like lipoprotein size distribution).We expected that transgenic expression of PDZK1(Y20A) would not be able to correct in PDZK1 KO mice their striking defects in hepatic SR-BI protein expression and lipoprotein metabolism, because earlier studies suggested that such a mutant adaptor protein would not be able to bind to hepatic SR-BI. Remarkably, PDZK1 KO mice expressing PDZK1(Y20A) protein (levels 10–20-fold higher than endogenous PDZK1 in WT mice) exhibited hepatic SR-BI protein expression not significantly different from WT control mice (Fig. 7), a substantial amount of which was expressed on the surfaces of the hepatocytes (Fig. 8), and a significant and substantial, but not complete, restoration of normal lipoprotein metabolism (Fig. 7). There appear to be two possible explanations for these unexpected observations. First, the mutated PDZ1 domain of PDZK1(Y20A) might have retained some SR-BI binding activity and that residual activity combined with the in vivo overexpression of PDZK1(Y20A) may have been sufficient to partially complement the PDZK1 deficiency in the KO mice. We find this explanation unlikely, given our inability to detect any binding in vitro using the highly sensitive ITC method. Second, there may be an additional site(s) in PDZK1 other than PDZ1 (e.g. other PDZ domains or the C-terminal portion of the protein) that can bind to SR-BI and mediate the SR-BI-PDZK1 interaction required for hepatic SR-BI protein expression and consequent control of lipoprotein metabolism. Such an alternative site might exhibit a lower affinity for binding SR-BI than that of wild-type PDZ1 because overexpression of PDZK1(Y20A) did not completely correct the lipoprotein metabolism abnormalities in the PDKZ1 KO mice. Additional studies will be required to determine whether such additional SR-BI-binding sites exist and the role they might play in the mechanism underlying PDZK1-dependent SR-BI expression and function in the liver. IntroductionProtein interaction domains fold into stable, at least partially autonomously functioning, modular domains that mediate a wide variety of protein-protein interactions and appear to have played major roles in evolution. One of the most abundant of such domains in mammals is the PDZ (PSD-95/Discs-large/ZO-1) family of domains, with more than 250 members found in over 100 proteins in the human genome (1van Ham M. Hendriks W. Mol. Biol. Rep. 2003; 30: 69-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). PDZ domains are composed of ∼80–100 amino acids and fold into compact globular structures that usually contain six β-strands and two α-helices (2Doyle D.A. Lee A. Lewis J. Kim E. Sheng M. MacKinnon R. Cell. 1996; 85: 1067-1076Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (958) Google Scholar). PDZ domains often interact with the five C-terminal amino acids of their binding partners (target peptides), and the C-terminal residue is often hydrophobic, although some can interact with as many as seven residues of the C terminus of their targets (3Tonikian R. Zhang Y. Sazinsky S.L. Currell B. Yeh J.H. Reva B. Held H.A. Appleton B.A. Evangelista M. Wu Y. Xin X. Chan A.C. Seshagiri S. Lasky L.A. Sander C. Boone C. Bader G.D. Sidhu S.S. PLoS Biol. 2008; 6: e239Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). Many PDZ domain-containing proteins have multiple PDZ domains and thus can promote clustering or scaffolding of target proteins and can be involved in a wide variety of cellular functions (4Pawson T. Scott J.D. Science. 1997; 278: 2075-2080Crossref PubMed Scopus (1887) Google Scholar).One such multifunctional protein is PDZK1 (5Kocher O. Comella N. Tognazzi K. Brown L.F. Lab. Invest. 1998; 78: 117-125PubMed Google Scholar). PDZK1, a four PDZ domain-containing protein, is involved in the regulation of several membrane-associated proteins such as ion channels and cell-surface receptors (6Seidler U. Singh A. Chen M.

For example, PDZK1 plays a key role as a tissue-specific adaptor that controls the hepatic activity of the high density lipoprotein (HDL) receptor called scavenger receptor class B, type I (SR-BI) 3The abbreviations used are: SR-BIscavenger receptor class B type IKOknock-outCBLcarboxylate binding loopITCisothermal titration calorimetryTgtransgene.

Miettinen H.E. Krieger M. Endocr. Rev. 2003; 24: 357-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). SR-BI, which mediates the binding of HDL and other lipoproteins to cells and the consequent transfer of cholesterol, is most highly expressed in the liver and steroidogenic tissues, and it can be found in a variety of other tissues and cells (e.g. macrophages and endothelial cells). In addition to transporting cholesterol between lipoproteins and cells, SR-BI can function as a signaling receptor in endothelial cells, mediating the activation of intracellular signaling pathways in response to extracellular HDL (11Assanasen C.

In mice with homozygous inactivation of the PDZK1 gene (PDZK1 KO mice), there is a 95% decrease of expression of SR-BI protein in hepatocytes, a 50% reduction in small intestinal mucosa, but no change in the steroidogenic cells of the adrenal cortex, testes, or ovaries (9Kocher O.

The dramatic reduction in hepatic SR-BI protein expression in PDZK1 KO mice leads to an ∼70% increase in total plasma cholesterol in the form of abnormally large HDL particles, a phenotype similar to but not as severe as that in SR-BI KO mice (9Kocher O.

Indeed, normal expression of PDZK1 is athero- and cardio-protective in the apoE KO mouse model of atherosclerosis, presumably because it is necessary for normal hepatic SR-BI expression (24Kocher O.

Studies in PDZK1 KO mice have shown that the influence of PDZK1 on hepatic SR-BI is post-transcriptional (9Kocher O. Yesilaltay A. Cirovic C. Pal R. Rigotti A. Krieger M. J. Biol.

Hepatic transgenic overexpression experiments involving serial C-terminal truncation mutants of PDZK1 have shown that all four PDZ domains of PDZK1 are necessary for normal hepatic expression, localization, and function of SR-BI (26Fenske S.A.

Chem. 2009; 284: 5797-5806Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), although previous studies suggested that SR-BI interacts directly with only its PDZ1 domain (23Ikemoto M. Arai H. Feng D. Tanaka K. Aoki J. Dohmae N. Takio K. Adachi H. Tsujimoto M. Inoue K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2000; 97: 6538-6543Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar).Here, we have examined further the role of the PDZ1 domain in PDZK1 control of hepatic SR-BI protein expression and function in vitro and in vivo. We generated recombinant PDZ1 domains, wild-type and mutants carrying single amino acid substitutions in the PDZ1 carboxylate binding loop (CBL) (Lys14-Xaa4-Asn19-Tyr-Gly-Phe-Phe-Leu24), that were designed to interfere with PDZ1-SR-BI target peptide binding. We used isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) to measure SR-BI target peptide (503VLQEAKL509) binding to these recombinant proteins. We also determined the high resolution crystal structure of wild-type PDZ1 bound to its SR-BI target peptide to better understand the interaction and the effects of the amino acid substitutions on target peptide binding in vitro (two mutations abrogated binding and two had little effect). We incorporated two of the PDZ1 single residue substitutions, K14A (essentially normal target peptide binding, PDZK1(K14A)) and Y20A (no binding, PDZK1(Y20A)) into full-length PDZK1 expression constructs and used them to generate transgenic WT and PDZK1 KO mice with liver-specific expression of the transgenes. Unexpectedly, analysis of hepatic SR-BI protein expression (intracellular distribution and amount) and lipoprotein metabolism (total plasma cholesterol and plasma lipoprotein size distribution) in these and control animals suggests that interruption of SR-BI binding to PDZ1 only partially interferes with the ability of overexpressed PDZK1 to control SR-BI expression and lipoprotein metabolism. Thus, PDZK1 may have one or more binding sites for SR-BI in addition to the canonical site on PDZ1."

Schwann cells (SCs) are the main cell population infected by ML in the nerves, and infection triggers changes in the SC phenotype from a myelinated to a nonmyelinated state. In the present study, we show that expression of 9-O-acetyl GD3, a ganglioside involved in cellular anti-apoptotic signaling and nerve regeneration, increases in SCs following infection with ML. Observation by confocal microscopy together with coimmunoprecipitation suggested that this ganglioside participates in ML attachment and internalization by SC. Immunoblockage of 9-O-acetyl GD3 in vitro significantly reduced adhesion of ML to SC surfaces. Finally, we show that activation of the MAPK (ERK 1/2) pathway and SC proliferation, two known effects of ML on SCs that result in demyelization, are significantly reduced when the 9-O-acetyl GD3 ganglioside is immunoblocked. Taken together, these data suggest the involvement of 9-O-acetyl GD3 in ML infection on SCs."

Although β2-AR is one of the most extensively characterized members of the GPCR family (2Dohlman H.G. Thorner J. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Annu. Rev.

It is generally believed that in mammalian cells, secretory and membrane proteins are translocated across the ER membrane concurrent with their synthesis by membrane-bound ribosomes (4Lingappa V.R. Blobel G. Recent Prog. Horm. Res. 1980; 36: 451-475PubMed Google Scholar). This co-translational translocation for GPCRs begins with the synthesis of the signal peptide or the first hydrophobic transmembrane sequences of the protein (5Wallin E. von Heijne G.

Thus, the localization of integral membrane protein-encoding mRNAs to the ER is achieved by the binding interactions of the ribosome and translation product with the components of the ER (7Walter P.

On the contrary, translation-independent mRNA localization usually requires the recognition of the transcript by RNA-binding proteins within the nucleus, which renders the mRNA-protein complex translationally inactive when the complex reaches the cytoplasm (9Czaplinski K.

Lal A. Yang X. Gorospe M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2004; 101: 2987-2992Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). HuR has two N-terminal RNA recognition motifs (RRM) with a high affinity for U-rich RNA sequences, a nucleocytoplasmic shuttling sequence, and a C-terminal RRM that can recognize the poly(A) tail (13Fan X.C.

We recently reported that cellular expression of β2-AR is suppressed at the translational level by 3′-untranslated region (UTR)-binding proteins (16Subramaniam K. Chen K. Joseph K. Raymond J.R.

The current study was designed to address the importance of translational silencing and mRNA localization in β2-AR trafficking to the plasma membrane. DDT1-MF2 vas deferens smooth muscle cells, A431 cells, and CHO cells were cultured as described previously (17Kandasamy K. Joseph K. Subramaniam K. Raymond J.R. Tholanikunnel B.G. J. Biol.

We used a stable transfection system to express two different short hairpin interfering (sh) RNAs against HuR. The shRNA expression vector was constructed by inserting synthetic double-stranded oligonucleotides between the BamHI and HindIII sites of the polymerase III gene promoter on vector pSUPER (Ref. 18Brummelkamp T.R.

The shRNA1 sequences were targeted to nucleotides on HuR-coding region “AAC ACG CTG AAC GGC TTG AGG” and shRNA2 sequences were targeted to nucleotides on HuR 3′-UTR “AAC GAC TCA ATT GTC CCG ATA” as described previously (19Mazan-Mamczarz K.

Cells were also transfected with pSuper vector harboring a mutation at positions 2 and 9 of the HuR target recognition sequence. G418-resistant clones were collected, and clones with significant reduction in HuR protein (clones 2 and 4, Fig. 1A) were used for studies involving β2-AR mRNA, protein, and immunofluorescence staining and were compared with cells expressing control shRNA. A pcDNA3 (Invitrogen)-based mammalian expression vector was used to clone Myc-tagged HuR that lacked the 3′-UTR of HuR cDNA. Because this chimeric HuR mRNA lacked the 3′-UTR it is insensitive to the shRNA2 that was used for the knockdown of HuR mRNA. IP experiments were carried out as described by Tenenbaum et al., (21Tenenbaum S.A. Lager P.J. Carson C.C. Keene J.D. Methods. 2002; 26: 191-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). In vitro transcription and UV cross-linked label transfer assays were performed essentially as described previously (17Kandasamy K. Joseph K. Subramaniam K. Raymond J.R. Tholanikunnel B.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 1931-1943Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The cDNA for HuR obtained by RT-PCR from DDT1-MF2 cells was cloned into the pET-42a(+) vector (Novagen). The sequences of the insert were verified by DNA sequencing and grown in the presence of kanamycin at 37 °C. Isolation of GST-HUR was done as described previously for GST-TIAR (17Kandasamy K.

The affinity of purified GST-HuR for 21-nt A+U-rich RNA was determined by gel mobility shift assay as described before for GST-TIAR (17Kandasamy K. Joseph K. Subramaniam K. Raymond J.R.

Cytoplasmic extracts of DDT1-MF2 cells expressing control shRNA and HuR-specific shRNA were made and used for polysome profile analysis of β2-AR mRNA as described previously (17Kandasamy K. Joseph K. Subramaniam K. Raymond J.R. Tholanikunnel B.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 1931-1943Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Twelve fractions were collected, total RNA was extracted from each fraction, and β2-AR and GAPDH mRNAs were quantified by RNase protection assays. DDT1-MF2 cells expressing control shRNA, HuR-specific shRNA and HuR-specific shRNA along with shHuR insensitive Myc-HuR were cotransfected with the firefly luciferase with or without receptor 3′-UTR and Renilla luciferase. Luciferase activities for firefly or Renilla luciferase were determined according to the manufacturer's instructions (Promega). Firefly luciferase was normalized by Renilla luciferase activities in all experiments and expressed relative to the indicated controls. Binding assays were performed on whole cells using a saturating concentration of 125I-iodocyanopindolol as described previously (17Kandasamy K. Joseph K. Subramaniam K. Raymond J.R.

The total number of β2-AR expressed in DDT1-MF2 cells expressing control shRNA and HuR-specific shRNA was determined by 125I-CYP in a filter binding assay. The number of cell surface β2-AR was determined by binding of the hydrophilic ligand [3H]CGP-12177 as described by Rands et al. (22Rands E. Candelore M.R. Cheung A.H. Hill W.S. Strader C.D.

For membrane isolation, cells were homogenized by polytron disruption and centrifuged at 450 × g for 5 min at 4 °C. The pellet was saved and the supernatants were centrifuged at 43,000 × g for 30 min. The light membrane fraction (supernatants) saved and the membrane fraction (pellet) was washed and solubilized in binding buffer containing protease inhibitors and used for radioligand binding assay. The light and heavy membrane fractions were incubated with β2-AR antibody (1:25). Controls included non-immune IgG-treated samples of the same dilution and antibody pre-incubated with 10 μm of the corresponding peptide for 2 h at 22 °C. The immune complexes were immobilized by adding protein A-agarose beads to each assay and allowed to rock for 6 h at 4 °C. The antibody-coated complexes were washed three times with buffer containing 0.1% Nonidet P-40. Specific 125I-CYP binding to receptor antibody-protein A-agarose beads was measured by rapid vacuum filtration over glass fiber filters as described for the whole-cell binding assay. In controls, β2-AR antibody was replaced with control IgG. In a second set of controls, β2-AR antibody was preincubated with 10 μm of the corresponding peptide for 2 h at 22 °C. cAMP generation was measured using an enzyme-immunoassay (EIA) system (Amersham Biosciences). Cells were cultured in 96-well plates overnight. Medium was aspirated and treated with isoproterenol (10 μm) dissolved in serum-free medium for 5 min at 37 °C. cAMP generated was calculated using a standard curve per the manufacturer's instructions. For immunofluorescence staining, cells were grown on 35-mm lysine-coated glass-bottom culture dishes (MatTek Corporation) and fixed in PBS containing 4% paraformaldehyde, 4% sucrose, and 2 mm MgCl2. Fixed cells were washed and permeabilized in 0.3% Triton X-100 in PBS. Nonspecific binding sites were blocked with 3% normal serum (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) in PBS for 2 h. The cells were incubated overnight at 4 °C with the specific primary antibodies: rabbit polyclonal β2-adrenergic receptor (1:50) (sc-569; H-20; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.), monoclonal HUR (1:200) (sc-5261; 3A2; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.), followed by incubation for 1 h at room temperature with the appropriate Alexa Fluor-conjugated secondary antibodies (1:200) (Molecular Probes). DRAQ5 (Alexis Corporation) (1:500 in PBS for 20 min) was used to visualize the nuclei. Antisense riboprobes used for in situ hybridization were transcribed in vitro from sense β2-AR cDNA as described previously (17Kandasamy K. Joseph K. Subramaniam K. Raymond J.R. Tholanikunnel B.G. J.

Cells were fixed, washed and permeabilized as described above. Prehybridization was performed in 50% formamide, 5 × SSC, 0.2% SDS, 50 μg/ml heparin, 250 ng/ml salmon sperm DNA, and 250 μg/ml yeast tRNA. Hybridization was performed in the same solution supplemented with 150 μg/ml heparin and 150 ng/ml of digoxigenin-riboprobe. After washing, nonspecific binding sites were blocked with 3% normal serum (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) in PBS for 2 h. The probe signal was amplified using biotinylated antidigoxin followed by streptavidin coupled to Cy3. Confocal microscopy was performed using a Zeiss LSM 510 META laser-scanning microscope (Carl Zeiss, Inc.). Earlier studies have identified the 3′-UTR of β2-AR mRNA as a target for HuR protein (17Kandasamy K. Joseph K. Subramaniam K. Raymond J.R. Tholanikunnel B.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 1931-1943Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 23Blaxall B.C. Pellett A.C. Wu S.C. Pende A. Port J.D. J. Biol.

In order to characterize how the interaction of the RNA-binding protein HuR with β2-AR mRNA can influence receptor expression, we performed specific HuR mRNA knockdown by RNA interference on two different cell lines (DDT1-MF2 and A431) that endogenously express β2-AR. Successful attenuation of HuR protein was confirmed by comparing Western blot analyses of extracts from cells expressing a control short hairpin RNA (shRNA) with cells expressing HuR-specific shRNA (Fig. 1A). To study the effect of HuR knockdown on β2-AR mRNA, total RNA was extracted from these cells and β2-AR and GAPDH mRNAs were measured with an RNase protection assay (Fig. 1B). Knockdown of HuR to below 20% of the control levels led to greater than 90% reduction in β2-AR mRNA without any detectable change in GAPDH mRNA (estimated by direct analysis of radioactivity by phoshorimaging). These results suggest that HuR enhances steady state levels of β2-AR mRNA, similar to many other transcripts to which this protein is reported to bind (12de López Zhan M. Lal A. Yang X. Gorospe M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2004; 101: 2987-2992Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar, 14Fan X.C. Steitz J.A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3448-3460Crossref PubMed Scopus (747) Google Scholar). Receptor expression was quantified in HuR knockdown and control cells using a cell-permeable hydrophobic radioligand, 125I-cyanopindolol (125I-CYP). Paradoxically, attenuation of HuR levels resulted in a 2.0–3.0-fold increase in receptor expression (Fig. 1C; 1.5 to 2 fmol/105 cells in control shRNA-expressing cells compared with 4–4.5 fmol/105 cells in HuR-specific shRNA-expressing cells). A direct comparison of the receptor expression and mRNA levels in different HuR knockdown clones (Fig. 1, B and C) showed that β2-AR expression is negatively correlated with its mRNA levels as reported before (17Kandasamy K.

To test whether translation of β2-AR mRNA is linked to its decay, we treated HuR knockdown and control cells with cycloheximide (50 μg/ml) and compared the change in β2-AR mRNA over time. This concentration of cycloheximide treatment for 3 h resulted in more than 90% inhibition of protein synthesis as measured by trichloroacetic acid precipitation of newly synthesized proteins (data not shown). Cycloheximide treatment and decreased protein synthesis resulted in more pronounced stabilization of β2-AR mRNA in HuR knockdown cells (Fig. 1D, left panel) compared with cells expressing control shRNA (Fig. 1D, right panel). A role for the 3′-UTR of β2-AR mRNA in HuR protein association was confirmed by IP of this protein from cytosolic extracts of Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells transfected with full-length and 3′-UTR deletion constructs of β2-AR cDNA. RNA isolated from the immunoprecipitate was analyzed by RT-PCR. IP of HuR protein resulted in co-precipitation of β2-AR mRNA when CHO cells were transfected with full-length β2-AR cDNA (Fig. 2A). Using cytosolic extracts from CHO cells transfected with 3′-UTR deletion constructs significantly reduced the amount of β2-AR mRNA that was co-precipitated using HuR antibody. Whereas IP with control IgG1 failed to co-precipitate β2-AR mRNA, the use of T-cell-restricted intracellular antigen-related protein (TIAR) antibody (positive control) resulted in co-precipitation of β2-AR mRNA as demonstrated previously (17Kandasamy K. Joseph K. Subramaniam K. Raymond J.R. Tholanikunnel B.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 1931-1943Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Additional evidence for HuR association with β2-AR mRNA was obtained by UV-cross-linking of cytosolic lysates from DDT1-MF2 cells with in vitro transcribed 32P-labeled receptor 3′-UTR RNA, followed by IP of the resulting complexes in the presence or absence of specific anti-HuR or control IgG1. Radiolabeled RNA corresponding to the full-length (530 nt, Fig. 2B, lanes 1–3), proximal (190 nt, lanes 4–6), and distal (340 nt, lanes 7–9) 3′-UTRs of β2-AR mRNA were separately assessed to identify the regions that associate with HuR protein. Additionally, specific mutations were introduced into a 21 nt A+U-rich region present in the proximal 190 nt 3′-UTR to identify the binding site for HuR protein (lanes 10–12). Aliquots of the UV cross-linked material, when subjected to SDS-PAGE analysis after RNase digestion, showed significant label transfer to several proteins (Fig. 2B). IP of the cross-linked material without a specific antibody (control IgG1) yielded no radiolabeled bands. In contrast, the use of a specific anti-HuR antibody revealed that all three radiolabeled β2-AR 3′-UTR fragments showed marked label transfer to the HuR protein. Mutations to disrupt the 21 nt A+U-rich region (17Kandasamy K. Joseph K. Subramaniam K. Raymond J.R. Tholanikunnel B.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 1931-1943Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) in the 190-nt RNA abolished binding of HuR to this 3′-UTR RNA (Fig. 2B), demonstrating sequence specific label transfer to HuR protein from β2-AR mRNA 3′-UTR sequences. To address more directly the binding affinity of HuR to the 21 nt A+U-rich region, nondenaturing gel shift experiments were performed using GST-HuR and equimolar concentrations of in vitro transcribed, radiolabeled RNA corresponding to the 21 A+U-rich regions (Fig. 2C). The results of the gel shift analysis demonstrated that GST-HuR and not GST (lane 10) binds with high affinity (∼5 nm) to the 21 nt A+U-rich RNA. To examine the possibility that HuR may inhibit the synthesis of β2-AR, CHO cells were transiently co-transfected with equal quantities (5 μg) of receptor cDNA constructs with and without 3′-UTR sequences along with Myc-tagged HuR cDNAs. Because the deletion of 3′-UTR from β2-AR cDNA results in increased receptor expression (16Subramaniam K. Chen K. Joseph K. Raymond J.R. Tholanikunnel B.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 27108-27115Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), CHO cells also were co-transfected separately with 5 μg each of β2-AR cDNA, with and without 3′-UTR sequences to serve as proper controls. The control cells were co-transfected with empty vector in place of HuR cDNA. Receptor expression was measured in each group after 24 and 72 h of transfection (Fig. 3A). Because CHO cells lack endogenous β2-AR, the receptor measured should originate from the transfected β2-AR cDNAs. Cells co-transfected with HuR and full-length receptor cDNAs showed a 75% decrease in receptor expression after 24 h of transfection as compared with a 20% decrease in receptor expression observed in control cells (Fig. 3A, compare lanes 2 and 5). The decreased receptor expression at 24 h of transfection correlated with the increased HuR expression in these cells (Fig. 3B, upper panel, lane 2). Receptor measurement 72 h after transfection showed a significant increase only in the cells that are co-transfected with full-length β2-AR and HuR cDNAs (Fig. 3A, lane 3). Moreover, this increase in β2-AR expression correlated with the loss of HuR overexpression in transiently transfected cells (Fig. 3B, upper panel, lane 3). To confirm that the decreased receptor expression in CHO cells that are co-transfected with β2-AR and HuR cDNAs is due to translational suppression of β2-AR mRNA, we compared steady state levels of receptor mRNA at 0, 24, and 72 h of transfection (Fig. 3C). Receptor mRNA levels were significantly higher in CHO cells that were co-transfected with full-length β2-AR cDNA and Myc-HuR after 24 h of transfection as compared with controls (Fig. 3C, compare lanes 2 and 5). These results suggest that overexpression of HuR suppresses the translation of β2-AR mRNA. Furthermore, after 72 h of transfection, when HuR levels returned to the control values, β2-AR mRNA levels decreased, and receptor expression increased. We also used a reporter construct to validate the role of HuR as a β2-AR 3′-UTR-dependent translational regulator in vivo. Introduction of receptor 3′-UTR into the 3′-UTR of a luciferase reporter gene resulted in a 70% decrease in reporter gene expression when transfected into DDT1-MF2 cells expressing control shRNA (Fig. 3, D and E, lanes 1 and 2). Knockdown of endogenous HuR by shRNA enhanced translation from reporter transcripts in a receptor 3′-UTR sequence-dependent manner (Fig. 3, D and E, lanes 3 and 4). The specificity of the role of HuR in translation was further confirmed by overexpressing Myc-tagged HuR that is insensitive to the HuR-shRNA expressed. Expression of HuR restored the translational repression of reporter transcripts containing β2-AR 3′-UTR (Fig. 3, D and E, lanes 5 and 6). β-Tubulin is shown as a loading control (Fig. 3E, lower panel). To examine any possible role for HuR protein in β2-AR mRNA association with polyribosomes, we compared the distribution of endogenously expressed β2-AR mRNA in sucrose density gradient fractions. Cytoplasmic extracts of cells expressing control shRNA and HuR-specific shRNA were used. Sucrose density gradient fractionation and RNA extractions were performed as described previously (16Subramaniam K. Chen K. Joseph K. Raymond J.R. Tholanikunnel B.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 27108-27115Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 17Kandasamy K. Joseph K. Subramaniam K. Raymond J.R. Tholanikunnel B.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 1931-1943Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Monosomes and polysomes were well separated as identified by absorbance at 254 nm (Fig. 4A, upper panel). Twelve continuous fractions, from lightest to heaviest, were collected, and total RNA was extracted from each fraction, and the distribution of β2-AR mRNA (Fig. 4A, lower panel) was determined in these fractions by RPA. A substantial portion of endogenously expressed β2-AR mRNA was found to be associated with low molecular weight ribosomes, including 40 S ribosomes, when cells expressing control shRNA were used. On the contrary, when cytoplasmic extracts of HuR knockdown DDT1-MF2 cells were used for polysome analysis, a clear shift in receptor mRNA to heavier polyribosomal fractions was observed (Fig. 4B, upper and lower panels). These results suggest inefficient translation of β2-AR mRNA in control cells and increased polyribosome association and translation in HuR knockdown cells. The polysome profile of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate (GAPDH) mRNA also was analyzed in control and HuR knockdown cells to serve as a loading control (Fig. 4C). The distribution of GAPDH mRNA was similar in control and HuR knockdown cells, suggesting that HuR knockdown effects were specific to β2-AR mRNA. Densitometric analysis was used to determine the relative distribution of β2-AR mRNA and GAPDH mRNA in different fractions of the gradient (Fig. 4D). The properties of receptors expressed in HuR knockdown cells were examined by immunofluorescence staining of β2-AR and HuR. The β2-AR staining pattern in HuR knockdown cells showed significant immunoreactivity for receptors around the nucleus (Fig. 5, A and B, arrows). In cells with significant immunoreactivity for HuR, the receptors appeared on the plasma membrane (Fig. 5A, arrowhead), with no detectable β2-AR immunoreactivity around the nucleus. The presence of cells with and without HuR within the same microscopic field provides an internal control for the confocal images presented. These results suggest that HuR-mediated translational suppression of β2-AR mRNA plays a critical role in receptor trafficking to the plasma membrane. Knockdown of HuR showed a similar effect on β2-AR expression in another cell line (A431) that endogenously expresses both receptor and HuR protein (supplemental Fig. S1). To test the possibility that receptor over-production in HuR knockdown cells may lead to failed trafficking to the plasma membrane, we transfected DDT1-MF2 cells with full-length hamster β2-AR cDNA. Transfection resulted in a 2–3-fold increase in receptor expression, comparable to the levels measured in HuR knockdown cells (Fig. 5C). Immunofluorescence staining and confocal images revealed varying levels of receptor overexpression in different cells. However, all of the overexpressed receptors are present on the plasma membrane (Fig. 5C and supplemental Fig. S2) and do not accumulate around the nucleus. These results demonstrate that receptor over-production is not the reason for the failed trafficking of β2-AR in HuR knockdown cells. To further test the role of 3′-UTR in receptor trafficking to the plasma membrane, we transfected DDT1-MF2 cells with 3′-UTR deletion constructs of hamster β2-AR cDNA. Transfection resulted in increased receptor expression,"
https://openalex.org/W2019764465,"Carbohydrate binding modules (CBMs) are specialized proteins that bind to polysaccharides and oligosaccharides. Caldanaerobius polysaccharolyticus Man5ACBM16-1/CBM16-2 bind to glucose-, mannose-, and glucose/mannose-configured substrates. The crystal structures of the two proteins represent the only examples in CBM family 16, and studies that evaluate the roles of amino acid residues in ligand binding in this family are lacking. In this study, we probed the roles of amino acids (selected based on CBM16-1/ligand co-crystal structures) on substrate binding. Two tryptophan (Trp-20 and Trp-125) and two glutamine (Gln-81 and Gln-93) residues are shown to be critical in ligand binding. Additionally, several polar residues that flank the critical residues also contribute to ligand binding. The CBM16-1 Q121E mutation increased affinity for all substrates tested, whereas the Q21G and N97R mutants exhibited decreased substrate affinity. We solved CBM/substrate co-crystal structures to elucidate the molecular basis of the increased substrate binding by CBM16-1 Q121E. The Gln-121, Gln-21, and Asn-97 residues can be manipulated to fine-tune ligand binding by the Man5A CBMs. Surprisingly, none of the eight residues investigated was absolutely conserved in CBM family 16. Thus, the critical residues in the Man5A CBMs are either not essential for substrate binding in the other members of this family or the two CBMs are evolutionarily distinct from the members available in the current protein database. Man5A is dependent on its CBMs for robust activity, and insights from this study should serve to enhance our understanding of the interdependence of its catalytic and substrate binding modules."
