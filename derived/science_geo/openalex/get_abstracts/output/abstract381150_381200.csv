https://openalex.org/W2111452477,"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) mediate post-transcriptional gene regulation through association with Argonaute proteins (AGOs). Crystal structures of archaeal and bacterial homologues of AGOs have shown that the MID (middle) domain mediates the interaction with the phosphorylated 5' end of the miRNA guide strand and this interaction is thought to be independent of the identity of the 5' nucleotide in these systems. However, analysis of the known sequences of eukaryotic miRNAs and co-immunoprecipitation experiments indicate that there is a clear bias for U or A at the 5' position. Here we report the crystal structure of a MID domain from a eukaryotic AGO protein, human AGO2. The structure, in complex with nucleoside monophosphates (AMP, CMP, GMP, and UMP) mimicking the 5' end of miRNAs, shows that there are specific contacts made between the base of UMP or AMP and a rigid loop in the MID domain. Notably, the structure of the loop discriminates against CMP and GMP and dissociation constants calculated from NMR titration experiments confirm these results, showing that AMP (0.26 mM) and UMP (0.12 mM) bind with up to 30-fold higher affinity than either CMP (3.6 mM) or GMP (3.3 mM). This study provides structural evidence for nucleotide-specific interactions in the MID domain of eukaryotic AGO proteins and explains the observed preference for U or A at the 5' end of miRNAs."
https://openalex.org/W2087591041,"Type 2 Diabetes (T2D) and other chronic diseases are caused by a complex combination of many genetic and environmental factors. Few methods are available to comprehensively associate specific physical environmental factors with disease. We conducted a pilot Environmental-Wide Association Study (EWAS), in which epidemiological data are comprehensively and systematically interpreted in a manner analogous to a Genome Wide Association Study (GWAS).We performed multiple cross-sectional analyses associating 266 unique environmental factors with clinical status for T2D defined by fasting blood sugar (FBG) concentration > or =126 mg/dL. We utilized available Centers for Disease Control (CDC) National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) cohorts from years 1999 to 2006. Within cohort sample numbers ranged from 503 to 3,318. Logistic regression models were adjusted for age, sex, body mass index (BMI), ethnicity, and an estimate of socioeconomic status (SES). As in GWAS, multiple comparisons were controlled and significant findings were validated with other cohorts. We discovered significant associations for the pesticide-derivative heptachlor epoxide (adjusted OR in three combined cohorts of 1.7 for a 1 SD change in exposure amount; p<0.001), and the vitamin gamma-tocopherol (adjusted OR 1.5; p<0.001). Higher concentrations of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) such as PCB170 (adjusted OR 2.2; p<0.001) were also found. Protective factors associated with T2D included beta-carotenes (adjusted OR 0.6; p<0.001).Despite difficulty in ascertaining causality, the potential for novel factors of large effect associated with T2D justify the use of EWAS to create hypotheses regarding the broad contribution of the environment to disease. Even in this study based on prior collected epidemiological measures, environmental factors can be found with effect sizes comparable to the best loci yet found by GWAS."

https://openalex.org/W2032560191,"CD95 (also called Fas and APO-1) is a prototypical death receptor that regulates tissue homeostasis mainly in the immune system through the induction of apoptosis. During cancer progression CD95 is frequently downregulated or cells are rendered apoptosis resistant, raising the possibility that loss of CD95 is part of a mechanism for tumour evasion. However, complete loss of CD95 is rarely seen in human cancers and many cancer cells express large quantities of CD95 and are highly sensitive to CD95-mediated apoptosis in vitro. Furthermore, cancer patients frequently have elevated levels of the physiological ligand for CD95, CD95L. These data raise the possibility that CD95 could actually promote the growth of tumours through its non-apoptotic activities. Here we show that cancer cells in general, regardless of their CD95 apoptosis sensitivity, depend on constitutive activity of CD95, stimulated by cancer-produced CD95L, for optimal growth. Consistently, loss of CD95 in mouse models of ovarian cancer and liver cancer reduces cancer incidence as well as the size of the tumours. The tumorigenic activity of CD95 is mediated by a pathway involving JNK and Jun. These results demonstrate that CD95 has a growth-promoting role during tumorigenesis and indicate that efforts to inhibit its activity rather than to enhance it should be considered during cancer therapy."
https://openalex.org/W2120126501,"Recent evidence supports a role for microRNAs (miRNAs) in regulating the life span of model organisms. However, little is known about how these small RNAs contribute to human aging. Here, we profiled the expression of over 800 miRNAs in peripheral blood mononuclear cells from young and old individuals by real-time RT-PCR analysis. This genome-wide assessment of miRNA expression revealed that the majority of miRNAs studied decreased in abundance with age. We identified nine miRNAs (miR-103, miR-107, miR-128, miR-130a, miR-155, miR-24, miR-221, miR-496, miR-1538) that were significantly lower in older individuals. Among them, five have been implicated in cancer pathogenesis. Predicted targets of several of these miRNAs, including PI3 kinase (PI3K), c-Kit and H2AX, were found to be elevated with advancing age, supporting a possible role for them in the aging process. Furthermore, we found that decreasing the levels of miR-221 was sufficient to cause a corresponding increase in the expression of the predicted target, PI3K. Taken together, these findings demonstrate that changes in miRNA expression occur with human aging and suggest that miRNAs and their predicted targets have the potential to be diagnostic indicators of age or age-related diseases."

https://openalex.org/W1978149457,"Atomic nuclei have a shell structure where nuclei with 'magic numbers' of neutrons and protons are analogous to the noble gases in atomic physics. Only ten nuclei with the standard magic numbers of both neutrons and protons have so far been observed. The nuclear shell model is founded on the precept that neutrons and protons can move as independent particles in orbitals with discrete quantum numbers, subject to a mean field generated by all the other nucleons. Knowledge of the properties of single-particle states outside nuclear shell closures in exotic nuclei is important for a fundamental understanding of nuclear structure and nucleosynthesis (for example the r-process, which is responsible for the production of about half of the heavy elements). However, as a result of their short lifetimes, there is a paucity of knowledge about the nature of single-particle states outside exotic doubly magic nuclei. Here we measure the single-particle character of the levels in 133Sn that lie outside the double shell closure present at the short-lived nucleus 132Sn. We use an inverse kinematics technique that involves the transfer of a single nucleon to the nucleus. The purity of the measured single-particle states clearly illustrates the magic nature of 132Sn."
https://openalex.org/W2005704128,"For the brain to function properly, the excitatory synapses — which push target neurons to fire more — need to be balanced by inhibitory ones. But how this is wired up during development has been unclear. Now Hisashi Umemori and colleagues show that two members of the fibroblast growth factor family, the cell–cell signalling molecules FGF22 and FGF7, promote the formation of excitatory and inhibitory synapses, respectively. Genetic ablation of FGF22 produces mice that are resistant to the induction of epilepsy, while FGF7-deficient mice are prone to seizures. Future work should address whether these FGFs are expressed abnormally in epileptic patients, and whether the application or blockade of FGFs/FGFRs alleviates seizures. Proper functioning of the brain requires a balance between the formation of excitatory and inhibitory synapses, but how this is achieved during development is unclear. Here FGF22 and FGF7, two fibroblast growth factor cell–cell signalling molecules, are shown to promote the formation of excitatory and inhibitory synapses, respectively, through their effect on epilepsy in mice. These findings should inform other neurological and psychiatric disorders involving defects in synapse formation. The differential formation of excitatory (glutamate-mediated) and inhibitory (GABA-mediated) synapses is a critical step for the proper functioning of the brain. An imbalance in these synapses may lead to various neurological disorders such as autism, schizophrenia, Tourette’s syndrome and epilepsy1,2,3,4. Synapses are formed through communication between the appropriate synaptic partners5,6,7,8. However, the molecular mechanisms that mediate the formation of specific synaptic types are not known. Here we show that two members of the fibroblast growth factor (FGF) family, FGF22 and FGF7, promote the organization of excitatory and inhibitory presynaptic terminals, respectively, as target-derived presynaptic organizers. FGF22 and FGF7 are expressed by CA3 pyramidal neurons in the hippocampus. The differentiation of excitatory or inhibitory nerve terminals on dendrites of CA3 pyramidal neurons is specifically impaired in mutants lacking FGF22 or FGF7. These presynaptic defects are rescued by postsynaptic expression of the appropriate FGF. FGF22-deficient mice are resistant to epileptic seizures, and FGF7-deficient mice are prone to them, as expected from the alterations in excitatory/inhibitory balance. Differential effects of FGF22 and FGF7 involve both their distinct synaptic localizations and their use of different signalling pathways. These results demonstrate that specific FGFs act as target-derived presynaptic organizers and help to organize specific presynaptic terminals in the mammalian brain."
https://openalex.org/W2112402590,"Mechanotransduction is the process by which physical forces are converted into biochemical signals that are then integrated into cellular responses. It plays a crucial role in bone repair and regeneration and thus has attracted a great deal of interest from researchers in various fields. This report reviews the current clinical evidence that shows the role mechanotransduction plays in bone processes such as physical adaptation, pathological fracture healing, and therapeutic distraction osteogenesis. We also outline the progress that has been made in understanding bone mechanotransduction from both the macro- and microperspectives. Specifically, we describe the theories that postulate how mechanical force exhibits effects on bone repair and regeneration (i.e., the tensegrity and mechanosome theories). We also summarize the recent advances in our understanding of the molecular signaling pathways of mechanotransduction, which include calcium ion channels, integrins, Wnt/β-catenin, prostaglandin, and nitric oxide. A better understanding of skeletal mechanotransduction will facilitate research into this promising field and could lead to the development of applications that improve bone structures and functions."
https://openalex.org/W2094287689,"Cerebral microvascular occlusion is a common phenomenon throughout life that might require greater recognition as a mechanism of brain pathology. Failure to recanalize microvessels promptly may lead to the disruption of brain circuits and significant functional deficits. Haemodynamic forces and the fibrinolytic system are considered to be the principal mechanisms responsible for recanalization of occluded cerebral capillaries and terminal arterioles. Here we identify a previously unrecognized cellular mechanism that may also be critical for this recanalization. By using high-resolution fixed-tissue microscopy and two-photon imaging in living mice we observed that a large fraction of microemboli infused through the internal carotid artery failed to be lysed or washed out within 48 h. Instead, emboli were found to translocate outside the vessel lumen within 2-7 days, leading to complete re-establishment of blood flow and sparing of the vessel. Recanalization occurred by a previously unknown mechanism of microvascular plasticity involving the rapid envelopment of emboli by endothelial membrane projections that subsequently form a new vessel wall. This was followed by the formation of an endothelial opening through which emboli translocated into the perivascular parenchyma. The rate of embolus extravasation was significantly decreased by pharmacological inhibition of matrix metalloproteinase 2/9 activity. In aged mice, extravasation was markedly delayed, resulting in persistent tissue hypoxia, synaptic damage and cell death. Alterations in the efficiency of the protective mechanism that we have identified may have important implications in microvascular pathology, stroke recovery and age-related cognitive decline."
https://openalex.org/W2166818063,"Background SALL4 is a member of the SALL gene family that encodes a group of putative developmental transcription factors. Murine Sall4 plays a critical role in maintaining embryonic stem cell (ES cell) pluripotency and self-renewal. We have shown that Sall4 activates Oct4 and is a master regulator in murine ES cells. Other SALL gene members, especially Sall1 and Sall3 are expressed in both murine and human ES cells, and deletions of these two genes in mice lead to perinatal death due to developmental defects. To date, little is known about the molecular mechanisms controlling the regulation of expressions of SALL4 or other SALL gene family members. Methodology/Principal Findings This report describes a novel SALL4/OCT4 regulator feedback loop in ES cells in balancing the proper expression dosage of SALL4 and OCT4 for the maintenance of ESC stem cell properties. While we have observed that a positive feedback relationship is present between SALL4 and OCT4, the strong self-repression of SALL4 seems to be the “break” for this loop. In addition, we have shown that SALL4 can repress the promoters of other SALL family members, such as SALL1 and SALL3, which competes with the activation of these two genes by OCT4. Conclusions/Significance Our findings, when taken together, indicate that SALL4 is a master regulator that controls its own expression and the expression of OCT4. SALL4 and OCT4 work antagonistically to balance the expressions of other SALL gene family members. This novel SALL4/OCT4 transcription regulation feedback loop should provide more insight into the mechanism of governing the “stemness” of ES cells."
https://openalex.org/W2162198899,"Background Staphylococcus aureus is a versatile bacterial opportunist responsible for a wide spectrum of infections. The severity of these infections is highly variable and depends on multiple parameters including the genome content of the bacterium as well as the condition of the infected host. Clinically and epidemiologically, S. aureus shows a particular capacity to survive and adapt to drastic environmental changes including the presence of numerous antimicrobial agents. Mechanisms triggering this adaptation remain largely unknown despite important research efforts. Most studies evaluating gene content have so far neglected to analyze the so-called intergenic regions as well as potential antisense RNA molecules. Principal Findings Using high-throughput sequencing technology, we performed an inventory of the whole transcriptome of S. aureus strain N315. In addition to the annotated transcription units, we identified more than 195 small transcribed regions, in the chromosome and the plasmid of S. aureus strain N315. The coding strand of each transcript was identified and structural analysis enabled classification of all discovered transcripts. RNA purified at four time-points during the growth phase of the bacterium allowed us to define the temporal expression of such transcripts. A selection of 26 transcripts of interest dispersed along the intergenic regions was assessed for expression changes in the presence of various stress conditions including pH, temperature, oxidative shocks and growth in a stringent medium. Most of these transcripts showed expression patterns specific for the defined stress conditions that we tested. Conclusions These RNA molecules potentially represent important effectors of S. aureus adaptation and more generally could support some of the epidemiological characteristics of the bacterium."
https://openalex.org/W1963843984,"The receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE) is a pattern-recognition receptor that binds to diverse ligands and initiates a downstream proinflammatory signaling cascade. RAGE activation has been linked to diabetic complications, Alzheimer disease, infections, and cancers. RAGE is known to mediate cell signaling and downstream proinflammatory gene transcription activation, although the precise mechanism surrounding receptor-ligand interactions is still being elucidated. Recent fluorescence resonance energy transfer evidence indicates that RAGE may form oligomers on the cell surface and that this could be related to signal transduction. To investigate whether RAGE forms oligomers, protein-protein interaction assays were carried out. Here, we demonstrate the interaction between RAGE molecules via their N-terminal V domain, which is an important region involved in ligand recognition. By protein cross-linking using water-soluble and membrane-impermeable cross-linker bis(sulfosuccinimidyl) suberate and nondenaturing gels, we show that RAGE forms homodimers at the plasma membrane, a process potentiated by S100B and advanced glycation end products. Soluble RAGE, the RAGE inhibitor, is also capable of binding to RAGE, similar to V peptide, as shown by surface plasmon resonance. Incubation of cells with soluble RAGE or RAGE V domain peptide inhibits RAGE dimerization, subsequent phosphorylation of intracellular MAPK proteins, and activation of NF-κB pathways.

The human RAGE gene (or AGER) is located on chromosome 6 in the major histocompatibility complex class III region that contains 11 exons. RAGE consists of 404 amino acids with a molecular mass of 45–55 kDa, which can be variable depending on differential glycosylation states (1.Neeper M. Schmidt A.M. Brett J. Yan S.D. Wang F. Pan Y.C.

Structurally, RAGE belongs to the immunoglobulin superfamily, and the protein consists of an N-terminal signal peptide (amino acids 1–22), a V-type immunoglobulin-like domain (amino acids 23–116), two tandem C-type immunoglobulin-like domains (amino acids 124–221 and 227–317, respectively), a single transmembrane domain (amino acids 343–363), and a short C-terminal intracellular cytoplasmic tail (amino acids 364–404) (1.Neeper M.

For example, S100B binds to both the V and C1 domains, whereas S100A6 binds to C1 and C2 domains (15.Leclerc E. Fritz G. Weibel M. Heizmann C.W. Galichet A. J. Biol.

The cytoplasmic tail is essential for RAGE-mediated cell signaling, although this sequence has no homology to any known protein-tyrosine or serine/threonine kinase motif. Recent evidence using a yeast two-hybrid approach suggests that the RAGE cytoplasmic domain interacts with diaphanous-1 (Dia-1), and this potential binding partner could constitute the basis for intracellular signaling (17.Hudson B.I.

Shekhtman A. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 27255-27269Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). This property may be necessary for AGE ligand recognition and signal transduction, albeit in a manner dissimilar from the well characterized phosphotyrosine kinase receptors for many growth factors and cytokines (29.Lemmon M.A. Exp. Cell Res. 2009; 315: 638-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). It has been shown that bacterially expressed sRAGE form tetramers in vitro (30.Xie J. Burz D.S. He W. Bronstein I.B. Lednev I. Shekhtman A. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 4218-4231Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar), but to date, very little experimental evidence has been provided to identify the oligomerization of RAGE on the cell surface. This study sought to determine the nature of RAGE oligomerization and whether this property is altered by ligand binding and required for downstream signaling. Our findings add to understanding the molecular nature of RAGE and highlight possibilities for novel intervention strategies. HEK293T cells from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS) and 100 μg/ml PrimocinTM and were maintained in a humidified incubator containing 5% CO2 at 37 °C. Approximately 1 × 106 HEK293T cells were plated in each well of a 6-well plate in 10% FCS/DMEM for 24 h. Cells were then cultured in 1% FCS/DMEM for another 24 h followed by S100B or AGE-BSA treatment. For transfection of plasmids in HEK293T cells, 3 × 106 cells were plated on 100-mm Petri dishes at 24 h before transfection. DNA-Lipofectamine 2000 complex was prepared by mixing 1 ml of Opti-MEM I reduced serum medium containing HA-RAGE and GFP-RAGE plasmids (4 μg each) with 1 ml containing 30 μl of Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) and incubating the mixture at room temperature for 20 min. DNA-Lipofectamine 2000 complex was added to the wells containing cells and 10% FCS/DMEM. 24 h post-transfection, cells were harvested for immunoprecipitation or cultured for another 24 h in 1% FCS/DMEM followed by S100B or AGE-BSA for further analysis. Full-length of RAGE cDNA was isolated from the human retinal Müller glial cell line (MIO-M1; a kind gift from Dr. Astrid Limb, Institute of Ophthalmology, University College London, UK) using primers 5′-AAGGAATTCATGGCAGCCGGAACAGCAGTTGGAGC-3′ and 5′-ATTCTCGAGTCAAGGCCCTCCAGTACTACTCTC-3′ and inserted into EcoRI/XhoI restriction sites of pcDNA3-GFP, pcDNA3-HA, pGEX-4T-1 vectors. RAGE deletions, which were termed as NM (amino acids 1–363, sense primer 5′-AAGGAATTCATGGCAGCCGGAACAGCAGTTGGAGC-3′ and antisense primer 5′-AGTCTCGAGTTACTTCCCAGGAATCTGGTAGACAC-3′), CM (amino acids 318–404, sense primer 5′-CTAGAATTCATCAGCATCATCGAACCAGGCG-3′ and antisense primer 5′-ATTCTCGAGTCAAGGCCCTCCAGTACTACTCTC-3′), V (amino acids 1–123, sense primer 5′-AAGGAATTCATGGCAGCCGGAACAGCAGTTGGAGC-3′ and antisense primer 5′-AGTCTCGAGTTACTTCCCAGGAATCTGGTAGACAC-3′), C (amino acids 124–342, sense primer 5′-GCCGAATTCCCAGAAATTGTAGATTCTGCCTC-3′ and antisense primer 5′-ATTCTCGAGTTAGGCTAGAGTTCCCAGCCCTGATC-3′), C1 (amino acids 124–226, sense primer 5′-GCCGAATTCCCAGAAATTGTAGATTCTGCCTC-3′ and antisense primer: 5′-ATTCTCGAGTTACTGGATGGGGGCTGTGCGCAAG-3′), C2 (amino acids 227–342, sense primer 5′-ATAGAATTCCCCCGTGTCTGGGAGCCTGT-3′ and antisense primer 5′-ATTCTCGAGTTAGGCTAGAGTTCCCAGCCCTGATC-3′), were PCR-amplified, and subcloned into EcoRI/XhoI restriction sites of pcDNA3-GFP, pcDNA3-HA, and pGEX-4T-1 vectors. For RAGE cysteine mutants, cysteine at amino acids 38, 99, 144, 208, 259, or 301 was mutated to alanine individually by site-directed point mutagenesis and subcloned into pcDNA3-HA vector. The cis-reporter plasmid pNFKB-Luc (Stratagene) encodes a Photinus pyralis (firefly) luciferase under a regular TATA box and an enhancer element with a synthetic promoter of five tandem NF-κB-binding sites. The pRL plasmid (Promega) contains a Renilla reniformis (Renilla) luciferase cDNA under the control human cytomegalovirus promoter. HEK293T cells were plated onto coverslips in a 6-well plate. Cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 1 h at room temperature followed by permeabilization using 0.2% Triton X-100, 5% BSA/PBS for 5 min on ice. The coverslips were then blocked in 5% BSA/PBS for 1 h at room temperature. After a brief washing, the coverslips were incubated with mouse monoclonal anti-RAGE antibody (1:1000) (Millipore) at 4 °C overnight, washed, and incubated with Alexa Fluor 488 goat anti-mouse IgG (1:500) (Invitrogen) in a dark chamber for 1 h at room temperature. After extensive washing, the coverslips were inverted and mounted on slides with Vectashield mounting medium with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (Vector Laboratories). The immunofluorescence was assessed using Nikon TE-2000 confocal microscopy. AGE-modified albumin was prepared as described previously (31.Stitt A.W. He C. Vlassara H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 256: 549-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). 50 mg/ml BSA was incubated with 0.5 m of d-glucose in 0.2 m PBS, pH 7.4, at 37 °C for 60 days. Control albumin was incubated for a comparable time in PBS alone. AGEs were dialyzed in 0.2 m sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, and were passed through a Detoxi-Gel endotoxin removing column (Pierce). The protein concentration was determined using BCA quantification kit (Pierce). HEK293T cells maintained in 1% FCS/DMEM were treated with the indicated amount of S100B or AGE-BSA for 30 min. Cell lysates were prepared with RIPA buffer (50 mm Tris·HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS, 1 mm EDTA, 5 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm NaF, 1× protease inhibitor mixture) on ice for 30 min. 20 μg of the total protein was applied to a 10% SDS-PAGE and blotted to an Immobilon-FL polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore). Quantitative Western blotting was performed using Odyssey infrared imaging system (Li-COR), which allows detection of two proteins simultaneously by using fluorescently labeled antibodies and quantification of proteins more accurately over a much wider linear dynamic range than chemiluminescence by using near-infrared fluorescence detection (32.Ramsay A.J. Dong Y. Hunt M.L. Linn M. Samaratunga H. Clements J.A. Hooper J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 12293-12304Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Briefly, the Immobilon-FL polyvinylidene difluoride membrane was incubated with rabbit monoclonal anti-p44/42 (1:1000) or p-p44/42 (1:1000) antibody (Cell Signaling Technology) together with mouse monoclonal β-actin antibody (1:20,000, Sigma) at 4 °C overnight followed by incubation with IRDye 680 goat anti-rabbit and IRDye 800CW goat anti-mouse secondary antibodies (1:10,000) (Li-COR) at room temperature for 30 min. The membrane was then scanned, and the bands were quantified using the Odyssey imaging system. For immunoprecipitation, HEK293T cells were transfected with GFP-RAGE and HA-RAGE or pcDNA3-HA vector, treated with RAGE ligands as aforementioned, and lysed in RIPA buffer. 500 μg of the total cell lysates were precleared with protein A/G Plus beads (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for 1 h at 4 °C and then incubated with anti-HA antibody (Roche Applied Science) and protein A/G Plus beads overnight at 4 °C. The beads were extensively washed, eluted by boiling in SDS protein sample buffer, and subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. pGEX-4T-1-RAGE, pGEX-4T-1-sRAGE, and pGEX-4T-1-V were transformed into BL21 Escherichia coli. Transformed E. coli cells were induced by 0.2 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 4 h at 37 °C. Cells were harvested and lysed in Buffer A (25 mm Tris·HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mg/ml lysozyme, 1 mg/ml DNase I, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm DTT, 1 mm PMSF). The pellet was collected by centrifugation and washed with Buffer B (25 mm Tris·HCl, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm DTT, 1 mm PMSF, 1% Triton X-100) and Buffer C (25 mm Tris·HCl, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm DTT, 1 mm PMSF, 2 m urea). The pellet was then resuspended in Buffer D (50 mm Tris·HCl, pH 8.0, 10 mm DTT, 8 m urea). The aqueous fraction was dialyzed with gradient urea buffer (25 mm Tris·HCl, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm DTT supplemented with 6, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0 m of urea, respectively). The dialyzed samples were centrifuged, and the GST fusion proteins in the supernatants were purified with MagneGST beads (Promega) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Purified proteins were cleaved as required using Thrombin CleanCleave kit (Sigma) according to the manual. Cleaved GST tag was cleared from the protein samples by MagneGST beads. HEK293T cells were transfected with a GFP-RAGE expression plasmid in 100-mm Petri dishes. 24 h after transfection, cell lysates were prepared with RIPA buffer and incubated with GST-fused RAGE, sRAGE, or V peptide, which had been pre-immobilized to glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads. The protein-bound beads were extensively washed and then eluted in SDS protein sample buffer at 95 °C for 5 min. The eluates were loaded onto an SDS-polyacrylamide gel. Protein cross-linking using bis(sulfosuccinimidyl) suberate (BS3) was performed according to the manufacturer's manual. Briefly, HEK293T cells were harvested in PBS at a density of 2 × 107 cells/ml, washed three times with ice-cold PBS, and then incubated with 4 mm BS3 for 30 min at room temperature. The reaction was terminated by adding 20 mm Tris·HCl, pH 7.5, for 15 min at room temperature. Cells were then lysed in RIPA buffer, and Western blotting was performed by loading 20 μg of the whole cell lysates on an 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. Native gels containing 8% acrylamide were prepared in 0.375 m Tris·HCl, pH 8.8, without SDS. The cell lysates were mixed with 5× native gel sample buffer (312.5 mm Tris·HCl, pH 6.8, 0.05% bromphenol blue, 10% glycerol). The gel loaded with 20 μg of the total protein was run in native PAGE buffer (25 mm Tris·HCl, 192 mm glycine). Proteins were then transferred to an Immobilon-FL polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. Western blotting was performed as described above. Protein binding interactions were performed using a surface plasmon resonance (SPR) Biacore Q system (Biacore) as described previously (15.Leclerc E. Fritz G. Weibel M. Heizmann C.W. Galichet A. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 31317-31331Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. GST and GST-RAGE were immobilized onto distinct flow cells on the surface of CM5 chips (Biacore) via amine coupling with the carboxyl groups of the chip dextran surface activated with 1:1 (v/v) solution of 0.2 m 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide hydrochloride and 50 mm N-hydroxysuccinimide for 7 min at a flow rate of 5 μl/min. 75 μl of protein to be immobilized (50 μg/ml) in sodium acetate buffer, pH 4.5, was applied at a flow rate of 5 μl/min. Unreacted ester groups were blocked by a 7-min injection of 1.0 m ethanolamine hydrochloride solution (35 μl). 11,000 RU were obtained with GST, and 6545 RU were obtained for GST-RAGE. For the study of protein-protein interactions, RAGE, sRAGE, and V peptide were diluted in 50 mm Tris buffer (0.15 m NaCl, 5 mm CaCl2, 0.005% (v/v) P20, pH 7.5) from 0.2 to 12.8 μm. SPR sample run conditions consisted of a cycle length of 5 min with a flow rate of 10 μl/min. At the end of each cycle, the chip surface was regenerated using 50 mm NaOH (10 μl, 30 s). Measurements of protein interactions were obtained from resulting SPR sensograms and expressed in terms of observed binding to immobilized proteins as measured by arbitrary resonance units (RU). HEK293T cells (3 × 104 cells per well in 24-well plates) were incubated in 2% FCS-supplemented DMEM for 24 h prior to transfection. Cells were mock-transfected or co-transfected with 2 μg of cytomegalovirus-driven Renilla luciferase plasmid (pRL) and 200 μg of pGL3 basic vector (Promega) or pNFKB-Luc. 24 h post-transfection, cells were treated with 10 μg/ml S100B for another 24 h. Cells were lysed in Passive Lysis Buffer (Promega) and subjected to Dual-Luciferase assay (Promega) followed by quantification using a Microlumat Plus LB96V luminometer (Berthold). To investigate RAGE blockade by sRAGE and V peptide, cells were incubated with purified GST-tagged sRAGE or V peptide at 24 h post-transfection. 10 μg/ml S100B was added to the medium containing the recombinant peptides. In parallel, cells were cultured in fresh medium to remove the free peptides in the previous medium before S100B treatment. 24 h after S100B treatment, cells were lysed in Passive Lysis Buffer and subjected to Dual-Luciferase assay. Immunofluorescence and Western blotting analysis demonstrated that RAGE is expressed in HEK293T cells, which is consistent with the finding that HEK293 cells react with S100 proteins (33.Ghavami S. Rashedi I. Dattilo B.M. Eshraghi M. Chazin W.J. Hashemi M. Wesselborg S. Kerkhoff C. Los M. J. Leukocyte Biol. 2008; 83: 1484-1492Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). RAGE was localized to the plasma membrane of the HEK293T cells (Fig. 1A), and the RAGE antibody recognized four major bands with molecular masses of 55, 50, and 45 kDa and a RAGE splicing form of 35 kDa, respectively (Fig. 1B). The specificity of the RAGE immunoreactivity was demonstrated by the absence or significant diminution of bands following transfection of HEK293T cells with RAGE-specific siRNA (Fig. 1B). In comparison with untreated cells, those treated with increasing concentrations of AGE-BSA or S100B demonstrated a RAGE ligand-induced phosphorylation of various protein kinases, including p44/42 (ERK1/2), MEK1/2, p38, JNK, and p90RSK, in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 1C). In contrast, the phosphorylation level of Akt remained unaltered by RAGE ligand exposure (Fig. 1C). The increased phosphorylation of p44/42 and MEK1/2 in S100B or AGE-BSA-treated HEK293T cells was observed at 10 min and peaked at 1 h post-treatment when compared with the basal phosphorylation levels of p44/42 and MEK1/2 in nontreated cells (Fig. 1D). Control (non-AGE-modified) BSA produced no response (data not shown). HEK293T cells were transfected with RAGE siRNA to determine whether S100B or AGE-BSA-induced activations of MAPK pathways are RAGE-dependent. RAGE siRNA-transfected HEK293T cells failed to show S100B and AGE-BSA-induced phosphorylation of p44/42, whereas the cells expressing the scrambled siRNA still showed the increased phosphorylation of p44/42 (Fig. 1E). Fluorescence resonance energy transfer analysis of RAGE ligands has indicated that RAGE forms oligomers (23.Wang L. Li S. Jungalwala F.B. J. Neurosci. Res. 2008; 86: 1254-1266Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). To further study this phenomenon, the RAGE cDNA was subcloned into pcDNA3 vectors containing GFP or HA tag. GFP-RAGE plasmid was co-transfected with pcDNA3-HA vector or HA-RAGE plasmid. At 24 h post-transfection, cells were treated with S100B or AGE-BSA, and co-immunoprecipitation was carried out with anti-HA antibody and the whole cell lysates. GFP-RAGE was detected by both anti-GFP antibody (green bands) and anti-RAGE antibody (red bands) in GFP-RAGE and HA-RAGE co-transfected cells but was absent in GFP-RAGE and pcDNA3-HA vector co-transfected cells (Fig. 2A). S100B or AGE-BSA treatment further potentiated the binding of GFP-RAGE to HA-RAGE (Fig. 2A). Quantification of the blots indicated that the interaction between RAGE proteins was enhanced by nearly 50% in the presence of 10 μg/ml S100B or 200 μg/ml AGE-BSA (Fig. 2B). To further examine the RAGE homo-interaction, RAGE was expressed as a GST fusion protein in E. coli, purified, immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads, and incubated with the lysates from GFP-RAGE-overexpressing HEK293T cells. GST-RAGE was shown as double bands on SDS-polyacrylamide gel, which is a common phenomenon for prokaryotically expressed GST fusion proteins, including GST-fused RAGE protein (17.Hudson B.I.

https://openalex.org/W1975963773,"A substantial number of individuals are at risk for the development of motion sickness induced nausea and vomiting (N&V) during road, air or sea travel. Motion sickness can be extremely stressful but the neurobiologic mechanisms leading to motion sickness are not clear. The endocannabinoid system (ECS) represents an important neuromodulator of stress and N&V. Inhibitory effects of the ECS on N&V are mediated by endocannabinoid-receptor activation.We studied the activity of the ECS in human volunteers (n = 21) during parabolic flight maneuvers (PFs). During PFs, microgravity conditions (<10(-2) g) are generated for approximately 22 s which results in a profound kinetic stimulus. Blood endocannabinoids (anandamide and 2-arachidonoylglycerol, 2-AG) were measured from blood samples taken in-flight before start of the parabolic maneuvers, after 10, 20, and 30 parabolas, in-flight after termination of PFs and 24 h later. Volunteers who developed acute motion sickness (n = 7) showed significantly higher stress scores but lower endocannabinoid levels during PFs. After 20 parabolas, blood anandamide levels had dropped significantly in volunteers with motion sickness (from 0.39+/-0.40 to 0.22+/-0.25 ng/ml) but increased in participants without the condition (from 0.43+/-0.23 to 0.60+/-0.38 ng/ml) resulting in significantly higher anandamide levels in participants without motion sickness (p = 0.02). 2-AG levels in individuals with motion sickness were low and almost unchanged throughout the experiment but showed a robust increase in participants without motion sickness. Cannabinoid-receptor 1 (CB1) but not cannabinoid-receptor 2 (CB2) mRNA expression in leucocytes 4 h after the experiment was significantly lower in volunteers with motion sickness than in participants without N&V.These findings demonstrate that stress and motion sickness in humans are associated with impaired endocannabinoid activity. Enhancing ECS signaling may represent an alternative therapeutic strategy for motion sickness in individuals who do not respond to currently available treatments."
https://openalex.org/W2054448683,"Background Germ cell transplantation results in fertile recipients and is the only available approach to functionally investigate the spermatogonial stem cell biology in mammals and probably in other vertebrates. In the current study, we describe a novel non-surgical methodology for efficient spermatogonial transplantation into the testes of adult tilapia (O. niloticus), in which endogenous spermatogenesis had been depleted with the cytostatic drug busulfan. Methodology/Principal Findings Using two different tilapia strains, the production of fertile spermatozoa with donor characteristics was demonstrated in adult recipient, which also sired progeny with the donor genotype. Also, after cryopreservation tilapia spermatogonial cells were able to differentiate to spermatozoa in the testes of recipient fishes. These findings indicate that injecting germ cells directly into adult testis facilitates and enable fast generation of donor spermatogenesis and offspring compared to previously described methods. Conclusion Therefore, a new suitable methodology for biotechnological investigations in aquaculture was established, with a high potential to improve the production of commercially valuable fish, generate transgenic animals and preserve endangered fish species."
https://openalex.org/W2131590496,"Background Polymorphisms affecting Toll-like receptor (TLR) structure appear to be rare, as would be expected due to their essential coordinator role in innate immunity. Here, we assess variation in TLR4 expression, rather than structure, as a mechanism to diversify innate immune responses. Methodology/Principal Findings We sequenced the TLR4 promoter (4,3 kb) in Swedish blood donors. Since TLR4 plays a vital role in susceptibility to urinary tract infection (UTI), promoter sequences were obtained from children with mild or severe disease. We performed a case-control study of pediatric patients with asymptomatic bacteriuria (ABU) or those prone to recurrent acute pyelonephritis (APN). Promoter activity of the single SNPs or multiple allelic changes corresponding to the genotype patterns (GPs) was tested. We then conducted a replication study in an independent cohort of adult patients with a history of childhood APN. Last, in vivo effects of the different GPs were examined after therapeutic intravesical inoculation of 19 patients with Escherichia coli 83972. We identified in total eight TLR4 promoter sequence variants in the Swedish control population, forming 19 haplotypes and 29 genotype patterns, some with effects on promoter activity. Compared to symptomatic patients and healthy controls, ABU patients had fewer genotype patterns, and their promoter sequence variants reduced TLR4 expression in response to infection. The ABU associated GPs also reduced innate immune responses in patients who were subjected to therapeutic urinary E. coli tract inoculation. Conclusions The results suggest that genetic variation in the TLR4 promoter may be an essential, largely overlooked mechanism to influence TLR4 expression and UTI susceptibility."
https://openalex.org/W2059972578,"Background The identification of new prognostic markers for prostate cancer is highly warranted, since it is difficult to identify patients requiring curative treatment. Data from both experimental models and clinical samples have identified important functions of PDGFRβ on pericytes and fibroblasts in the tumor stroma. Methodology/Principal Findings In this study the prognostic significance of PDGFRβ in prostate cancer stroma, and in matched non-malignant tissue, was evaluated with immunohistochemistry. PDGFRβ expression was analyzed in normal and tumor stroma from more than 300 prostate cancer patients. High PDGFRβ expression in tumor stroma was associated with large tumor size, advanced stage, high Gleason score and high vessel density. Perivascular PDGFRβ staining in tumors was also correlated with high Gleason score. Correlations were also observed between PDGFRβ status in tumor stroma and non-malignant stroma. Similarly, high PDGFRβ expression in adjacent non-malignant tissue stroma correlated with large tumor size, advanced stage, high Gleason score and proliferation in non-malignant epithelium. Interestingly, high levels of PDGFRβ in the stroma of tumor and non-malignant tissue were associated with shorter cancer specific survival in prostate cancer patients. Conclusions/Significance The study revealed a number of novel associations between stromal PDGFRβ expression in prostate tumors and several important clinical characteristics, including survival."
https://openalex.org/W2028768124,"The autosomal dominant peripheral sensory neuropathy HSAN1 results from mutations in the LCB1 subunit of serine palmitoyltransferase (SPT). Serum from patients and transgenic mice expressing a disease-causing mutation (C133W) contain elevated levels of 1-deoxysphinganine (1-deoxySa), which presumably arise from inappropriate condensation of alanine with palmitoyl-CoA. Mutant heterodimeric SPT is catalytically inactive. However, mutant heterotrimeric SPT has approximately 10-20% of wild-type activity and supports growth of yeast cells lacking endogenous SPT. In addition, long chain base profiling revealed the synthesis of significantly more 1-deoxySa in yeast and mammalian cells expressing the heterotrimeric mutant enzyme than in cells expressing wild-type enzyme. Wild-type and mutant enzymes had similar affinities for serine. Surprisingly, the enzymes also had similar affinities for alanine, indicating that the major affect of the C133W mutation is to enhance activation of alanine for condensation with the acyl-CoA substrate. In vivo synthesis of 1-deoxySa by the mutant enzyme was proportional to the ratio of alanine to serine in the growth media, suggesting that this ratio can be used to modulate the relative synthesis of sphinganine and 1-deoxySa. By expressing SPT as a single-chain fusion protein to ensure stoichiometric expression of all three subunits, we showed that GADD153, a marker for endoplasmic reticulum stress, was significantly elevated in cells expressing mutant heterotrimers. GADD153 was also elevated in cells treated with 1-deoxySa. Taken together, these data indicate that the HSAN1 mutations perturb the active site of SPT resulting in a gain of function that is responsible for the HSAN1 phenotype."
https://openalex.org/W1970798064,"The dramatic increase in antibiotic resistance and the recent manifestation in war trauma patients underscore the threat of Acinetobacter baumannii as a nosocomial pathogen. Despite numerous reports documenting its epidemicity, little is known about the pathogenicity of A. baumannii. The aim of this study was to obtain insight into the factors that might explain the clinical success of A. baumannii.We compared biofilm formation, adherence to and inflammatory cytokine induction by human cells for a large panel of well-described strains of A. baumannii and compared these features to that of other, clinically less relevant Acinetobacter species. Results revealed that biofilm formation and adherence to airway epithelial cells varied widely within the various species, but did not differ among the species. However, airway epithelial cells and cultured human macrophages produced significantly less inflammatory cytokines upon exposure to A. baumannii strains than to strains of A. junii, a species infrequently causing infection.The induction of a weak inflammatory response may provide a clue to the persistence of A. baumannii in patients."
https://openalex.org/W2093107609,"Bisphenol A (BPA), used in the manufacture of plastics, is ubiquitously distributed in the aquatic environment. However, the effect of maternal transfer of these xenobiotics on embryonic development and growth is poorly understood in fish. We tested the hypothesis that BPA in eggs, mimicking maternal transfer, impact development, growth and stress performance in juveniles of rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss).Trout oocytes were exposed to 0, 30 and 100 microg.mL(-1) BPA for 3 h in ovarian fluid, followed by fertilization. The embryos were maintained in clean water and sampled temporally over 156-days post-fertilization (dpf), and juveniles were sampled at 400-dpf. The egg BPA levels declined steadily after exposure and were undetectable after 21- dpf. Oocyte exposure to BPA led to a delay in hatching and yolk absorption and a consistently lower body mass over 152-dpf. The growth impairment, especially in the high BPA group, correlated with higher growth hormone (GH) content and lower GH receptors gene expression. Also, mRNA abundances of insulin-like growth factors (IGF-1 and IGF-2) and their receptors were suppressed in the BPA treated groups. The juvenile fish grown from the BPA-enriched eggs had lower body mass and showed perturbations in plasma cortisol and glucose response to an acute stressor.BPA accumulation in eggs, prior to fertilization, leads to hatching delays, growth suppression and altered stress response in juvenile trout. The somatotropic axis appears to be a key target for BPA impact during early embryogenesis, leading to long term growth and stress performance defects in fish."
https://openalex.org/W1994474588,"The wealth of phenotypic descriptions documented in the published articles, monographs, and dissertations of phylogenetic systematics is traditionally reported in a free-text format, and it is therefore largely inaccessible for linkage to biological databases for genetics, development, and phenotypes, and difficult to manage for large-scale integrative work. The Phenoscape project aims to represent these complex and detailed descriptions with rich and formal semantics that are amenable to computation and integration with phenotype data from other fields of biology. This entails reconceptualizing the traditional free-text characters into the computable Entity-Quality (EQ) formalism using ontologies.We used ontologies and the EQ formalism to curate a collection of 47 phylogenetic studies on ostariophysan fishes (including catfishes, characins, minnows, knifefishes) and their relatives with the goal of integrating these complex phenotype descriptions with information from an existing model organism database (zebrafish, http://zfin.org). We developed a curation workflow for the collection of character, taxonomic and specimen data from these publications. A total of 4,617 phenotypic characters (10,512 states) for 3,449 taxa, primarily species, were curated into EQ formalism (for a total of 12,861 EQ statements) using anatomical and taxonomic terms from teleost-specific ontologies (Teleost Anatomy Ontology and Teleost Taxonomy Ontology) in combination with terms from a quality ontology (Phenotype and Trait Ontology). Standards and guidelines for consistently and accurately representing phenotypes were developed in response to the challenges that were evident from two annotation experiments and from feedback from curators.The challenges we encountered and many of the curation standards and methods for improving consistency that we developed are generally applicable to any effort to represent phenotypes using ontologies. This is because an ontological representation of the detailed variations in phenotype, whether between mutant or wildtype, among individual humans, or across the diversity of species, requires a process by which a precise combination of terms from domain ontologies are selected and organized according to logical relations. The efficiencies that we have developed in this process will be useful for any attempt to annotate complex phenotypic descriptions using ontologies. We also discuss some ramifications of EQ representation for the domain of systematics."
https://openalex.org/W2034463580,"It is essential to understand the network of transcription factors controlling self-renewal of human embryonic stem cells (ESCs) and human embryonal carcinoma cells (ECs) if we are to exploit these cells in regenerative medicine regimes. Correlating gene expression levels after RNAi-based ablation of OCT4 function with its downstream targets enables a better prediction of motif-specific driven expression modules pertinent for self-renewal and differentiation of embryonic stem cells and induced pluripotent stem cells.We initially identified putative direct downstream targets of OCT4 by employing CHIP-on-chip analysis. A comparison of three peak analysis programs revealed a refined list of OCT4 targets in the human EC cell line NCCIT, this list was then compared to previously published OCT4 CHIP-on-chip datasets derived from both ES and EC cells. We have verified an enriched POU-motif, discovered by a de novo approach, thus enabling us to define six distinct modules of OCT4 binding and regulation of its target genes.A selection of these targets has been validated, like NANOG, which harbours the evolutionarily conserved OCT4-SOX2 binding motif within its proximal promoter. Other validated targets, which do not harbour the classical HMG motif are USP44 and GADD45G, a key regulator of the cell cycle. Over-expression of GADD45G in NCCIT cells resulted in an enrichment and up-regulation of genes associated with the cell cycle (CDKN1B, CDKN1C, CDK6 and MAPK4) and developmental processes (BMP4, HAND1, EOMES, ID2, GATA4, GATA5, ISL1 and MSX1). A comparison of positively regulated OCT4 targets common to EC and ES cells identified genes such as NANOG, PHC1, USP44, SOX2, PHF17 and OCT4, thus further confirming their universal role in maintaining self-renewal in both cell types. Finally we have created a user-friendly database (http://biit.cs.ut.ee/escd/), integrating all OCT4 and stem cell related datasets in both human and mouse ES and EC cells.In the current era of systems biology driven research, we envisage that our integrated embryonic stem cell database will prove beneficial to the booming field of ES, iPS and cancer research."
https://openalex.org/W2085297916,"Background Malignant melanoma is an exceptionally aggressive, drug-resistant and heterogeneous cancer. Recently it has been shown that melanoma cells with high clonogenic and tumourigenic abilities are common, but markers distinguishing such cells from cells lacking these abilities have not been identified. There is therefore no definite evidence that an exclusive cell subpopulation, i.e. cancer stem cells (CSC), exists in malignant melanoma. Rather, it is suggested that multiple cell populations are implicated in initiation and progression of the disease, making it of importance to identify subpopulations with elevated aggressive properties. Methods and Findings In several other cancer forms, Aldehyde Dehydrogenase (ALDH), which plays a role in stem cell biology and resistance, is a valuable functional marker for identification of cells that show enhanced aggressiveness and drug-resistance. Furthermore, the presence of ALDH+ cells is linked to poor clinical prognosis in these cancers. By analyzing cell cultures, xenografts and patient biopsies, we showed that aggressive melanoma harboured a large, distinguishable ALDH+ subpopulation. In vivo, ALDH+ cells gave rise to ALDH− cells, while the opposite conversion was rare, indicating a higher abilities of ALDH+ cells to reestablish tumour heterogeneity with respect to the ALDH phenotype. However, both ALDH+ and ALDH− cells demonstrated similarly high abilities for clone formation in vitro and tumour initiation in vivo. Furthermore, both subpopulations showed similar sensitivity to the anti-melanoma drugs, dacarbazine and lexatumumab. Conclusions These findings suggest that ALDH does not distinguish tumour-initiating and/or therapy-resistant cells, implying that the ALDH phenotype is not associated with more-aggressive subpopulations in malignant melanoma, and arguing against ALDH as a “universal” marker. Besides, it was shown that the ability to reestablish tumour heterogeneity is not necessarily linked to the more aggressive phenotype."
https://openalex.org/W2050332083,"This study aimed to investigate the immunological mechanisms involved in the gender distinct incidence of paracoccidioidomycosis (pcm), an endemic systemic mycosis in Latin America, which is at least 10 times more frequent in men than in women. Then, we compared the immune response of male and female mice to Paracoccidioides brasiliensis infection, as well as the influence in the gender differences exerted by paracoccin, a P. brasiliensis component with carbohydrate recognition property. High production of Th1 cytokines and T-bet expression have been detected in the paracoccin stimulated cultures of spleen cells from infected female mice. In contrast, in similar experimental conditions, cells from infected males produced higher levels of the Th2 cytokines and expressed GATA-3. Macrophages from male and female mice when stimulated with paracoccin displayed similar phagocytic capability, while fungicidal activity was two times more efficiently performed by macrophages from female mice, a fact that was associated with 50% higher levels of nitric oxide production. In order to evaluate the role of sexual hormones in the observed gender distinction, we have utilized mice that have been submitted to gonadectomy followed by inverse hormonal reconstitution. Spleen cells derived from castrated males reconstituted with estradiol have produced higher levels of IFN-γ (1291±15 pg/mL) and lower levels of IL-10 (494±38 pg/mL), than normal male in response to paracoccin stimulus. In contrast, spleen cells from castrated female mice that had been treated with testosterone produced more IL-10 (1284±36 pg/mL) and less IFN-γ (587±14 pg/mL) than cells from normal female. In conclusion, our results reveal that the sexual hormones had a profound effect on the biology of immune cells, and estradiol favours protective responses to P. brasiliensis infection. In addition, fungal components, such as paracoccin, may provide additional support to the gender dimorphic immunity that marks P. brasiliensis infection."

In this study, we showed that oral administration of high molecular weight HA (HA900) up-regulated suppressor of cytokine signaling 3 (SOCS3). In large intestinal epithelial cells, HA900 bound to TLR-4 on the cell surface and was not systemically absorbed. Furthermore, HA900 suppressed pleiotrophin expression, which is implicated in inflammation, in intestinal tissue and in arthritis. Pleiotrophin mRNA in the spinal cord is significantly up-regulated after induction of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (10Suzuki A. Hanada T. Mitsuyama K. Yoshida T. Kamizono S. Hoshino T.

Petersen W. Tillmann B. Mentlein R. Arthritis Rheum. 2003; 48: 660-667Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). These findings suggest that HA900 controls the immune system through up-regulation of SOCS3 and down-regulation of pleiotrophin. This is the first study to show a relationship between TLR-4 and high molecular weight HA. HA900 and HA oligosaccharides (HA oligos prepared by HCl degradation; Mr 3200–15,000) were obtained from Q.P. Corp. (Tokyo, Japan). Four-week-old female MRL-lpr/lpr mice were purchased from Charles River Japan (Yokohama, Japan) and cared for at our animal facility. All animal protocols were approved by the Animal Experiment Committee at Hyaluronan Research Institute, Inc. Female MRL-lpr/lpr mice were randomly placed into three groups. One group received water (control group); one received HA900 (200 mg/kg/day), and one received HA oligos (200 mg/kg/day). The substances were administered orally in water bottles to mice between 14 and 18 weeks of age. The volume of water ingested by each mouse (about 7 ml/day) was used to calculate the dose; each mouse received 29 mg/ml HA900 or HA oligos. One day after the final administration, all animals were sacrificed by exsanguination under general anesthesia. Their lymph nodes were weighed to assess the effects of treatment on DNT cells. HA polymer (average Mr of 757,000; Calbiochem) was dissolved in 50 mm phosphate/citrate buffer (pH 5.0) at 0.01 mg/ml as a stock coating solution, and 50 μl of this solution was poured into each well of a 96-well amine-conjugated microtiter plate (Sumitomo Bakelite, Japan). A volume of 10 μl of sodium cyanoborohydrate solution (10 mg/ml) was added to each well and incubated for 1 h at 25 °C. After washing three times with 10 mm phosphate-buffered saline (pH 6.8) containing 0.05% Tween 20 (PBS/Tween), 100 μl of diluted Block Ace® (DS Pharma Biomedical, Japan) solution (diluted 1:4 with pure water) was poured into each well and incubated for 1 h at 37 °C. After washing with PBS/Tween, 50 μl of different dilutions of standard HA solutions as well as diluted serum samples were poured into the wells followed by 50 μl of biotinylated HA-binding protein (Hokudo, Japan) solution (0.1 mg/ml) in diluted Block Ace® solution (diluted 1:10 with pure water). After incubation for 1 h at 37 °C followed by washing with PBS/Tween, 100 μl of horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated streptavidin (Avidin-PO, Calbiochem) solution (0.05 mg/ml) in diluted Block Ace® solution (1:10 dilution) was poured into each well, and the plates were incubated for 1 h at 37 °C. Finally, after washing with PBS/Tween, 100 μl of TMB peroxidase substrate was poured into each well and incubated for 20 min at room temperature before 100 μl of 0.1 n HCl was added. Absorbance at 450:630 nm was measured using an MTP-300 Microplate Reader (Corona Electric, Japan). The molecular weight of serum HA was estimated by agarose gel electrophoresis. In brief, samples were diluted to give HA concentrations of 30–35 μg/ml and mixed with an equal volume of 40% glycerol. A 0.75% agarose gel (10 × 10 × 0.2 cm) was prepared in 40 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.0) containing 50 mm sodium acetate and 9 mm EDTA (TAE buffer). Samples (10 μl) were loaded on the agarose gel, and electrophoresis was performed at a constant voltage of 25 V for 5 h at room temperature. After electrophoresis, the gel was soaked in TAE buffer containing 2 mml-ascorbic acid and 0.1 mm iron sulfate for 30 min before being washed twice with TAE buffer for 15 min. Hyaluronan in the gel was transferred to a positively charged nylon membrane (10 × 10 cm) (HybondTM-N+, GE Healthcare) at a constant electric current of 100 mA for 2 h in a semi-dry transfer unit (Hoefer® SemiPhorTM, GE Healthcare). After the transfer, the membrane was soaked in 10% skimmed milk in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) containing 0.1 m sodium chloride (TBS) overnight and washed twice with TBS. The membrane was then soaked in Block Ace® solution (diluted 1:10) containing 0.1 mg/ml biotinylated HA-binding protein and incubated for 1 h at room temperature. After washing three times with PBS/Tween, the membrane was soaked in Block Ace® solution (diluted 1:10) containing 0.05 mg/ml Avidin-PO. After washing three times with PBS/Tween, the membrane was rinsed with PBS and pure water to remove detergent and reacted with a chemical luminescent reagent mixture (SuperSignal, Pierce) for 5 min. The results were recorded on x-ray film (RX-U; Fuji Photo Film, Japan). Large intestinal tissues from control and HA900 groups were used in DNA array analyses (Takara Bio, Japan). To confirm the results, mRNA transcripts for SOCS3 were detected by RT-PCR, and quantification was performed using three samples. The intensities observed were typical, and clear statistical differences were found. Total RNA was isolated from large intestinal tissues of mice and HT29 cells using TRIzol reagents (Invitrogen); 1 μg of total RNA was used for the reverse transcript reactions. PCR amplification was performed for 35 cycles. For RT-PCR of the intestinal tissues, the SOCS3 primer sequences used in the study were as follows: forward, 5′-GCGAGAAGATTCCGCGGTA-3′; reverse, 5′-CCGTTGACAGTCTTCCGACAA-3′. For RT-PCR of the HT29 cells, the SOCS3 primer sequences used in the study were as follows: forward, 5′-CTTCAGCTCCAAGAGCGAGTA-3′; reverse, 5′-GAGCTGTCGCGGATCAGAAAG-3′. Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase primer sequences used were as follows: forward, 5′-ACCACAGTCCATCAC-3′; reverse, 5′-TCCACCACCCTGTTGCTGTA-3′. Frozen sections of lymph nodes taken from mice were treated with water or HA900 and immunostained with an antibody to pleiotrophin (Acris) followed by HRP-labeled rabbit IgG (Lab Vision Corp.). Frozen sections of large intestinal tissues and submandibular lymph nodes were stained with biotinylated HA-binding protein (Hokudo, Japan) followed by streptavidin-HRP (Lab Vision Corp.) and diaminobenzidine. Streptomyces hyaluronidase digestion of tissue sections was used as a control. The frozen sections of large intestinal tissues were also used for double staining with biotinylated HA-binding protein and anti-TLR-4 antibody (Abnova Corp.). Frozen sections of submandibular lymph nodes were analyzed for apoptosis using the terminal dUTP nick end-labeling method. Confluent HT29 cells were left untreated or were treated with HA oligos or with HA900 for 24 h. The cell lysates were obtained using a lysate kit (Funakoshi, Japan). The lysates were electrophoresed using Tris acetate gel. The samples were then transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. The membrane was immunostained for SOCS3 (first antibody, anti-human SOCS3 (Cell Signaling Technology, Japan); second antibody, HRP-anti-mouse IgG (Abnova)). Signals were detected using FCL solution (GE Healthcare) and recorded on x-ray film. DNT cells were obtained from lymph nodes of MRL-lpr/lpr mice and treated (4 × 105 cells/well) with pleiotrophin (0, 1, 10, and 100 ng/ml) or phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA; 100 ng/ml) for 6 h. A methanethiosulfonate assay was then performed using incubation with Cell Count Reagent SF (Nacalai Tesque, Kyoto, Japan) for 1 h. Data are shown as means ± S.E. of triplicate values. Each experiment was repeated at least three times. Confluent HT29 cells were incubated with 1 μg/ml HA900 or HA oligos for 1 h at room temperature. Large intestinal tissues from MRL-lpr/lpr mice treated orally with HA900 or HA oligos were frozen and sectioned. HT29 and large intestinal cells were then treated with biotinylated HA-binding protein. HT29 cells were then treated with anti-TLR-4 antibody followed by Texas Red anti-mouse IgG (GenWay Biotech Inc.). The same experiments were performed using TLR-4 knockdown HT29 cells. HT29 cells were left untreated or were treated with 1 μg/ml HA900 or HA oligos for 24 h at 37 °C. The samples were then used in Western blotting for SOCS3 antibody. Immunostaining for SOCS3 was performed in HT29 cells left untreated or treated with 1 μg of HA oligos or 0.01, 0.1, and 1 μg of HA900. The cells were then treated with a secondary antibody labeled with HRP (Abnova) followed by diaminobenzidine. The intensity of staining was analyzed by NIH Image. Lipofectamine (Invitrogen) was mixed with three types of TLR-4 RNA (CAGACTTGCGGGTTCTACATCAAAT, CGGATGGCAACATTTAGAATTAGTT, and GATCTCAGTAGAAATGGCTTGAGTT). The solution was added to HT29 cells in 24 wells of a 96-well plate. The plate was then incubated for 48 h at 37 °C. Then HA900 or HA oligos were added, and cells were incubated for 24 h. The knockdown and wild-type HT29 cells were immunostained for TLR-4, HA, and SOCS3. Serum (10 μl) was taken from each mouse, and sera from each group were pooled. Sera taken from mice who received water as well as those that received HA900 were used for array analyses of cytokines and chemokines (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, Raybio; n = 2). This experiment was repeated twice (n = 4). Treatment with HA900 (200 mg/kg/day) suppressed weight increases in submandibular (Fig. 1, a and b), mesenteric, inguinal, and axillary lymph nodes compared with controls, whereas treatment with HA oligos showed a trend toward lower weights but did not reach statistical significance (Fig. 1c). Cytokine and chemokine arrays showed up-regulation of IL-10 and down-regulation of MCP-5, MIP-2, regulated on activation normal T cell expressed and secreted, P-selectin, stem cell factor (SCF), and VEGF (Fig. 2). In the serum of C57 BL/6 mice (C57), the levels of MCP-5, SCF, and VEGF were not detected, because the C57 BL/6 mice were normal.FIGURE 2Results of cytokine and chemokine array analysis of serum.

Furthermore, HA was not detected in lymph nodes of control or HA900 groups (Fig. 3, c and d). DNA array analysis of large intestinal tissues showed that HA900 treatment up-regulated SOCS3 (ratio of HA900/DW, 2.0) and down-regulated pleiotrophin (ratio of HA900/DW, 0.5). Immunostaining for pleiotrophin in lymph nodes was stronger in the control group than in the HA900 group (Fig. 4a). RT-PCR analysis showed that SOCS3 mRNA expression in large intestines was stronger in the HA900 group than in the control group (Fig. 4b). DNT cells were obtained from lymph nodes of MRL-lpr/lpr mice by mincing the lymph nodes. It is well known that more than 90% of the lymphocytes of lymph nodes are DNT cells (5Xu H. Kurihara H. Ito T. Nakajima S. Hagiwara E. Yamanokuchi H. Asari A. J. Autoimmun. 2001; 16: 87-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar, 13Xu H. Kurihara H. Ito T. Kikuchi H. Yoshida K. Yamanokuchi H. Asari A. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 20879-20886Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). A large amount of cell debris (indicative of cell death of DNT cells) was observed among untreated controls (Fig. 5a). In contrast, only a small amount of debris was observed in control lymphocytes after treatment with pleiotrophin (Fig. 5a) or PMA (data not shown). PMA was used because PMA generally activates lymphocytes. Furthermore, a methanethiosulfonate assay also showed that treatment of DNT cells from MRL-lpr/lpr mice with pleiotrophin suppressed cell death as did treatment with PMA (Fig. 5b). Apoptosis in lymph node tissues from MRL-lpr/lpr mice increased after treatment with HA900 as indicated by the brown-stained cells (Fig. 5d), but this did not occur in the control group treated with distilled water (Fig. 5c). HA was detected in the lamina propria in intestinal tissues of control and HA900 groups (Fig. 6, a–c) but was also selectively detected on the luminal surface and intracellular space of intestinal epithelial cells in the HA900 group (Fig. 6, b and c) where it was often colocalized with TLR-4 (Fig. 6, f and g). The colocalization was restricted to this area. Most of the endogenous subepithelial HA was not colocalized with TLR-4 (Fig. 6, e–g). Treatment with S. hyaluronidase, specific for HA, abolished HA (Fig. 6d). Immunostaining for SOCS3 showed that HA900 treatment up-regulated SOCS3 expression (Fig. 7b) compared with control and HA oligo groups (Fig. 7a). Western blotting and RT-PCR showed increased SOCS3 expression in HT29 cells after treatment with HA900 but not when treated with HA oligos (Fig. 7, c and d). Wild-type HT29 cells expressed TLR-4 that was colocalized with HA900 (Fig. 8) or HA oligos (data not shown). On the other hand, neither HA900 (Fig. 9) nor HA oligos (data not shown) bound TLR-4 knockdown HT29 cells. Furthermore, HA900 did not change SOCS3 expression in the knockdown HT29 cells (Fig. 9).FIGURE 9Effects of TLR-4 knockdown in HT29 cells. Neither immunostaining of TLR-4 (red) nor HA staining (green) was detected. SOCS3 expression was not changed by the treatment with HA900.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Fig. 10 shows our model based on the studies in this report. TLR-4 receptors respond to bacterial endotoxins by up-regulation of pleiotrophin and pro-inflammatory cytokines. This increases inflammatory responses, including DNT lymphoaccumulation. Our studies support the model in which HA900 interacts with TLR-4 by a mechanism that blocks expression of pleiotrophin and up-regulates SOCS3. This would be consistent with the study showing that HA injections in LPS-treated mice promoted survival (14Muto J. Yamasaki K. Taylor K.R. Gallo R.L. Mol. Immunol. 2009; 47: 449-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). The mechanism may be related to HA interaction with CD44 capturing the kinase required for LPS-TLR-4 receptor activation. Otherwise, our model would have to find a way to distinguish between TLR-4 interaction with bacterial endotoxin and HA. Thus, cooperation from another receptor (CD44) may be crucial. Lymphoaccumulation reflects inflammation by Th-1-type cytokines in MRL-lpr/lpr mice (5Xu H. Kurihara H. Ito T. Nakajima S. Hagiwara E. Yamanokuchi H. Asari A. J. Autoimmun. 2001; 16: 87-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar, 6Kikawada E. Lenda D.M. Kelley V.R. J. Immunol. 2003; 170: 3915-3925Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is adequate and convenient to observe the lymphoaccumulation to examine the effect of substances on the immune system. Treatment with HA900 did not elicit any changes in the molecular weight or concentration of HA in serum. Furthermore, staining for HA in lymph nodes was not changed by treatment with HA900, which suggests that HA900 can modulate the function of the intestinal epithelium as a part of the immune system. Cultured DNT cells from MRL-lpt/lpr mice exhibited apoptotic programmed cell death without stimulation (3Stern R. Asari A.A. Sugahara K.N. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 2006; 85: 699-715Crossref PubMed Scopus (863) Google Scholar, 15Van Houten N. Budd R.C. J. Immunol. 1992; 149: 2513-2517PubMed Google Scholar); whereas treatment of DNT cells with pleiotrophin suppressed cell death. Furthermore, HA900 treatment induced apoptosis in the lymph node tissues. These results suggest that HA900 induces cell death of DNT cells by down-regulating pleiotrophin expression. Many reports have shown that SOCS3 suppresses inflammation, that IL-10 inhibits lipopolysaccharide-induced CD40 gene expression through induction of SOCS3 (16Lee H.G. Cowman M.K. Anal.

Our studies show that HA900 treatment of MRL-lpt/lpr mice increased SOCS3 mRNA and IL-10 consistent with its ability to suppress inflammatory responses. Intra-articular injection of HA900 suppresses inflammation in osteoarthritis (18Qin H. Wilson C.A. Roberts K.L. Baker B.J. Zhao X. Benveniste E.N. J. Immunol. 2006; 177: 7761-7771Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). In this study, oral administration of HA900 reduced lymphoaccumulation in MRL-lpr/lpr mice, which are a well established model for autoimmune diseases. These mice develop lymphoaccumulation (lymphoadenopathy), hypergammaglobulinemia, serum autoantibodies, and generalized autoimmune disease, including glomerulonephritis and arthritis, and have also been used as a model for systemic lupus erythematosus (3Stern R. Asari A.A. Sugahara K.N. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 2006; 85: 699-715Crossref PubMed Scopus (863) Google Scholar). This lymphoaccumulation disorder involves a marked increase in DNT cells (CD4−CD8−) in lpr mice and is explained by defects in Fas, which mediates apoptosis (19Watanabe-Fukunaga R. Brannan C.I. Copeland N.G. Jenkins N.A. Nagata S. Nature. 1992; 356: 314-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (2719) Google Scholar). Lymphoaccumulation also occurs due to hyperproduction of proinflammatory cytokines (5Xu H. Kurihara H. Ito T. Nakajima S. Hagiwara E. Yamanokuchi H. Asari A. J. Autoimmun. 2001; 16: 87-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar, 6Kikawada E. Lenda D.M. Kelley V.R. J. Immunol. 2003; 170: 3915-3925Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Most endogenous HA does not bind to TLR-4. Exogenous HA was found in apical epithelial cells of the upper villi of the large intestine, and colocalization of HA900 and TLR-4 was observed in these cells. HA900 may be taken up by intestinal epithelial cells via TLR-4. These results suggest that exogenous HA affects intestinal epithelial cells. We had speculated that oral administration of HA900 would stimulate intestinal epithelial cells, which produce cytokines as protection against infection following exposure to bacteria. When administered, HA900 colocalized with TLR-4 on intestinal epithelial cells, but HA900 did not bind TLR-4 knockdown HT29 cells, suggesting that HA900 is bound to TLR-4. TLR-4 is known to be expressed on the surface of intestinal epithelial cells (20Abreu M.T. Arnold E.T. Thomas L.S. Gonsky R. Zhou Y. Hu B. Arditi M. J. Biol.

HA900 may prevent MD-2 binding to TLR-4 in commensal pathogen-associated molecular patterns such as LPS, or HA900-induced SOCS3 may reduce lymphoaccumulation because SOCS3 is known to suppress production of proinflammatory cytokines and improve arthritis (10Suzuki A. Hanada T. Mitsuyama K. Yoshida T. Kamizono S. Hoshino T. Kubo M. Yamashita A. Okabe M. Takeda K. Akira S. Matsumoto S. Toyonaga A. Sata M. Yoshimura A. J. Exp. Med. 2001; 193: 471-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar). The biological activity of HA is dependent on its molecular weight (3Stern R. Asari A.A. Sugahara K.N. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 2006; 85: 699-715Crossref PubMed Scopus (863) Google Scholar). Low molecular weight HA enhances inflammation via TLR-4 (3Stern R. Asari A.A. Sugahara K.N. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 2006; 85: 699-715Crossref PubMed Scopus (863) Google Scholar), whereas the present results suggest that HA900 may suppress inflammation involving chemokines, leukocyte and lymphocyte adhesion, P-selectin, and SCF expression via TLR-4. Overexpression of proinflammatory cytokines causes autoimmune disease and inflammation. MRL-lpr/lpr mice do not exhibit these conditions in a clean environment because of diminished levels of intestinal bacterial flora (22Maldonado M.A. Kakkanaiah V. MacDonald G.C. Chen F. Reap E.A.

Array analysis of cytokines (a total of 37) and chemokines showed that HA900 treatment up-regulated IL-10, and suppressed MCP-5, MIP-2, regulated on activation normal T cell expressed and secreted, P-selectin, SCF, and VEGF. IL-10 suppresses chemokine production (23Szczepanik A.M. Ringheim G.E. J. Alzheimers Dis. 2003; 5: 105-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 24Petit-Bertron A.F. Fitting C. Cavaillon J.M.

Dis. Colon Rectum. 2007; 50: 2194-2202Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Furthermore, down-regulation of P-selectin suppresses the infiltration of lymphocytes and leukocytes (26Bonder C.S. Norman M.U. Macrae T. Mangan P.R. Weaver C.T. Bullard D.C. McCafferty D.M. Kubes P. Am. J.

The absolute suppression of SCF indicates that arthritis may be suppressed because SCF is implicated in processes in the arthritic synovium (28Ceponis A. Konttinen Y.T. Takagi M. Xu J.W. Sorsa T. Matucci-Cerinic M. Santavirta S. Bankl H.C. Valent P. J. Rheumatol. 1998; 25: 2304-2314PubMed Google Scholar). The suppression of VEGF also suggests potential improvement of arthritis (29Clavel G. Bessis N. Lemeiter D. Fardellone P. Mejjad O. Ménard J.F. Pouplin S. Boumier P. Vittecoq O. Le Loët X. Boissier M.C. Clin. Immunol. 2007; 124: 158-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Low molecular weight HA activates the innate immune response via TLR-2 in an MyD88-, IL-1R-associated kinase-, tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor-6-, protein kinase Cζ-, and NF-κB-dependent pathway. Furthermore, intact high molecular weight HA can inhibit TLR-2 signaling (30Scheibner K.A. Lutz M.A. Boodoo S. Fenton M.J. Powell J.D. Horton M.R. J. Immunol. 2006; 177: 1272-1281Crossref PubMed Scopus (545) Google Scholar). Arthritis did not occur in MRL-lpr/lpr mice in this study because these mice were too young. However, up-regulation of SOCS3 and suppression of pleiotrophin by HA900 treatment should suppress arthritis. Immunostaining, Western blotting, and RT-PCR for SOCS3 in HT29 cells showed that SOCS3 expression was enhanced by treatment with HA900 but not with HA oligos. HA900, which was added to HT29 cells, showed colocalization with TLR-4 in these cells. During treatment with TLR-4 small interfering RNA, TLR-4 protein expression was diminished. HA900 neither bound to TLR-4 knockdown HT29 cells nor up-regulated SOCS3 in these cells compared with wild-type HT29 cells treated with HA900. We conclude that oral administration of HA900 suppresses inflammation and Th-1-type autoimmune disease by up-regulating SOCS3 and down-regulating pleiotrophin via TLR-4 in intestinal epithelial cells.

https://openalex.org/W2054056559,"Background The canonical function of EEF1A2, normally expressed only in muscle, brain, and heart, is in translational elongation, but recent studies suggest a non-canonical function as a proto-oncogene that is overexpressed in a variety of solid tumors including breast and ovary. Transcriptional profiling of a spectrum of primary mouse B cell lineage neoplasms showed that transcripts encoding EEF1A2 were uniquely overexpressed in plasmacytomas (PCT), tumors of mature plasma cells. Cases of human multiple myeloma expressed significantly higher levels of EEF1A2 transcripts than normal bone marrow plasma cells. High-level expression was also a feature of a subset of cell lines developed from mouse PCT and from the human MM. Methodology/Principal Findings Heightened expression of EEF1A2 was not associated with increased copy number or coding sequence mutations. shRNA-mediated knockdown of Eef1a2 transcripts and protein was associated with growth inhibition due to delayed G1-S progression, and effects on apoptosis that were seen only under serum-starved conditions. Transcriptional profiles and western blot analyses of knockdown cells revealed impaired JAK/STAT and PI3K/AKT signaling suggesting their contributions to EEF1A2-mediated effects on PCT induction or progression. Conclusions/Significance EEF1A2 may play contribute to the induction or progression of some PCT and a small percentage of MM. Eef1a2 could also prove to be a useful new marker for a subset of MM and, ultimately, a possible target for therapy."
https://openalex.org/W2016758289,"The 505-million-year-old Burgess Shales of British Columbia are justifiably famous for the exquisite preservation of their fossils — and the extreme oddity of many of them, such as Anomalocaris and Hallucigenia, which for many years defied classification, and formed the basis of Stephen Jay Gould's book Wonderful Life. These and many other fossils have since been found homes alongside modern invertebrate phyla. Another of Gould's 'weird wonders' was Nectocaris. The few fossils available for study looked like a chordate fused with an arthropod. Now, with ninety new specimens collected by the Royal Ontario Museum to examine, Martin Smith and Jean-Bernard Caron suggest that Nectocaris, too, can be given a place in the order of things. Its anatomy suggests a relationship with cephalopods — a group that includes the octopus, cuttlefish, and extinct ammonites. And with paired camera-type eyes, flexible tentacles and jet propulsion via a 'nozzle', the predatory animal looks rather like a squid but with two rather than eight or ten tentacles. The 505-million-year-old Burgess Shales of British Columbia are justifiably famous for the exquisite preservation of their fossils, and for the extreme oddity of many of them. One such is Nectocaris pteryx, which, from the few fossils available for study, looked like a chordate fused with an arthropod. However, the collection and examination of more fossils of Nectocaris suggests that it in fact represents an early offshoot of cephalopod molluscs — a kind of squid, though with two rather than eight or ten tentacles. The exquisite preservation of soft-bodied animals in Burgess Shale-type deposits provides important clues into the early evolution of body plans that emerged during the Cambrian explosion1. Until now, such deposits have remained silent regarding the early evolution of extant molluscan lineages—in particular the cephalopods. Nautiloids, traditionally considered basal within the cephalopods, are generally depicted as evolving from a creeping Cambrian ancestor whose dorsal shell afforded protection and buoyancy2. Although nautiloid-like shells occur from the Late Cambrian onwards, the fossil record provides little constraint on this model, or indeed on the early evolution of cephalopods. Here, we reinterpret the problematic Middle Cambrian animal Nectocaris pteryx3,4 as a primitive (that is, stem-group), non-mineralized cephalopod, based on new material from the Burgess Shale. Together with Nectocaris, the problematic Lower Cambrian taxa Petalilium5 and (probably) Vetustovermis6,7 form a distinctive clade, Nectocarididae, characterized by an open axial cavity with paired gills, wide lateral fins, a single pair of long, prehensile tentacles, a pair of non-faceted eyes on short stalks, and a large, flexible anterior funnel. This clade extends the cephalopods’ fossil record2 by over 30 million years, and indicates that primitive cephalopods lacked a mineralized shell, were hyperbenthic, and were presumably carnivorous. The presence of a funnel suggests that jet propulsion evolved in cephalopods before the acquisition of a shell. The explosive diversification of mineralized cephalopods in the Ordovician may have an understated Cambrian ‘fuse’."
https://openalex.org/W2089143068,"Aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases hydrolyze aminoacyl adenylates and aminoacyl-tRNAs formed from near-cognate amino acids, thereby increasing translational fidelity. The contributions of pre- and post-transfer editing pathways to the fidelity of Escherichia coli threonyl-tRNA synthetase (ThrRS) were investigated by rapid kinetics. In the pre-steady state, asymmetric activation of cognate threonine and noncognate serine was observed in the active sites of dimeric ThrRS, with similar rates of activation. In the absence of tRNA, seryl-adenylate was hydrolyzed 29-fold faster by the ThrRS catalytic domain than threonyl-adenylate. The rate of seryl transfer to cognate tRNA was only 2-fold slower than threonine. Experiments comparing the rate of ATP consumption to the rate of aminoacyl-tRNA(AA) formation demonstrated that pre-transfer hydrolysis contributes to proofreading only when the rate of transfer is slowed significantly. Thus, the relative contributions of pre- and post-transfer editing in ThrRS are subject to modulation by the rate of aminoacyl transfer."
https://openalex.org/W2154706660,"Toll-like receptors (TLRs) play a central role in host defense by inducing inflammatory and adaptive immune responses following infection. Drugs that target TLRs are of considerable interest as potential inflammatory regulators, vaccine adjuvants, and novel immunotherapeutics. TLR2, in cooperation with either TLR1 or TLR6, mediates responses to a wide variety of microbial products as well as products of host tissue damage. In an effort to understand the structural basis of TLR2 recognition and uncover novel TLR2 agonists, a synthetic chemical library of 24,000 compounds was screened using an IL-8-driven luciferase reporter in cells expressing these human receptors. The screening yielded several novel TLR2-dependent activators that utilize TLR1, TLR6, or both as co-receptors. These novel small molecule compounds are aromatic in nature and structurally unrelated to any known TLR2 agonists. The three most potent compounds do not exhibit synergistic activity, nor do they act as pseudoantagonists toward natural TLR2 activators. Interestingly, two of the compounds exhibit species specificity and are inactive toward murine peritoneal macrophages. Mutational analysis reveals that although the central extracellular region of TLR1 is required for stimulation, there are subtle differences in the mechanism of stimulation mediated by the synthetic compounds in comparison with natural lipoprotein agonists. The three most potent compounds activate cells in the nanomolar range and stimulate cytokine production from human peripheral blood monocytes. Our results confirm the utility of high throughput screens to uncover novel synthetic TLR2 agonists that may be of therapeutic benefit."
https://openalex.org/W2013265008,"Molecular mechanisms involved in epileptogenesis in the developing brain remain poorly understood. The gene array approach could reveal some of the factors involved by allowing the identification of a broad scale of genes altered by seizures. In this study we used microarray analysis to reveal the gene expression profile of the laser microdissected hippocampal CA1 subregion one week after kainic acid (KA)-induced status epilepticus (SE) in 21-day-old rats, which are developmentally roughly comparable to juvenile children. The gene expression analysis with the Chipster software generated a total of 1592 differently expressed genes in the CA1 subregion of KA-treated rats compared to control rats. The KEGG database revealed that the identified genes were involved in pathways such as oxidative phosporylation (26 genes changed), and long-term potentiation (LTP; 18 genes changed). Also genes involved in Ca(2+) homeostasis, gliosis, inflammation, and GABAergic transmission were altered. To validate the microarray results we further examined the protein expression for a subset of selected genes, glial fibrillary protein (GFAP), apolipoprotein E (apo E), cannabinoid type 1 receptor (CB1), Purkinje cell protein 4 (PEP-19), and interleukin 8 receptor (CXCR1), with immunohistochemistry, which confirmed the transcriptome results. Our results showed that SE resulted in no obvious CA1 neuronal loss, and alterations in the expression pattern of several genes during the early epileptogenic phase were comparable to previous gene expression studies of the adult hippocampus of both experimental epileptic animals and patients with temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE). However, some changes seem to occur after SE specifically in the juvenile rat hippocampus. Insight of the SE-induced alterations in gene expression and their related pathways could give us hints for the development of new target-specific antiepileptic drugs that interfere with the progression of the disease in the juvenile age group."

https://openalex.org/W2152023569,"The ErbB2 oncogene is often overexpressed in breast tumors and associated with poor clinical outcome. p130Cas represents a nodal scaffold protein regulating cell survival, migration, and proliferation in normal and pathological cells. The functional role of p130Cas in ErbB2-dependent breast tumorigenesis was assessed by its silencing in breast cancer cells derived from mouse mammary tumors overexpressing ErbB2 (N202-1A cells), and by its reexpression in ErbB2-transformed p130Cas-null mouse embryonic fibroblasts. We demonstrate that p130Cas is necessary for ErbB2-dependent foci formation, anchorage-independent growth, and in vivo growth of orthotopic N202-1A tumors. Moreover, intranipple injection of p130Cas-stabilized siRNAs in the mammary gland of Balbc-NeuT mice decreases the growth of spontaneous tumors. In ErbB2-transformed cells, p130Cas is a crucial component of a functional molecular complex consisting of ErbB2, c-Src, and Fak. In human mammary cells, MCF10A.B2, the concomitant activation of ErbB2, and p130Cas overexpression sustain and strengthen signaling, leading to Rac1 activation and MMP9 secretion, thus providing invasive properties. Consistently, p130Cas drives N202-1A cell in vivo lung metastases colonization. These results demonstrate that p130Cas is an essential transducer in ErbB2 transformation and highlight its potential use as a novel therapeutic target in ErbB2 positive human breast cancers."
https://openalex.org/W2031267036,"Background Drug regulatory agencies (DRA) support prescription of generic products of intravenous antibiotics assuming therapeutic equivalence from pharmaceutical equivalence. Recent reports of deaths associated with generic heparin and metoprolol have raised concerns about the efficacy and safety of DRA-approved drugs. Methodology/Principal Findings To challenge the assumption that pharmaceutical equivalence predicts therapeutic equivalence, we determined in vitro and in vivo the efficacy of the innovator product and 20 pharmaceutically equivalent generics of gentamicin. The data showed that, while only 1 generic product failed in vitro (MIC = 45.3 vs. 0.7 mg/L, P<0.05), 10 products (including gentamicin reference powder) failed in vivo against E. coli due to significantly inferior efficacy (Emax = 4.81 to 5.32 vs. 5.99 log10 CFU/g, P≤0.043). Although the design lacked power to detect differences in survival after thigh infection with P. aeruginosa, dissemination to vital organs was significantly higher in animals treated with generic gentamicin despite 4 days of maximally effective treatment. Conclusion Pharmaceutical equivalence does not predict therapeutic equivalence of generic gentamicin. Stricter criteria based on solid experimental evidence should be required before approval for human use."

Large sequence polymorphisms and single nucleotide polymorphisms were analyzed to determine lineage and sublineage of isolates. Of 306 isolates genotyped, 246 (80.4%) belonged to the Euro-American lineage, with sublineage 724 predominating at African sites (99/192, 51.5%), and the Euro-American strains other than 724 predominating at non-African sites (89/114, 78.1%). Uneven distribution of lineages across regions limited our ability to discern significant associations, nonetheless, in univariate analyses, Euro-American sublineage 724 was associated with more severe disease at baseline, and along with the East Asian lineage was associated with lower bacteriologic conversion after 8 weeks of treatment.

https://openalex.org/W1971518524,"Biodiversity surveys were conducted on Saba Bank, Netherlands Antilles, to assess ichthyofaunal richness and to compare with published surveys of other Caribbean localities. The primary objective was to estimate the total species richness of the Saba Bank ichthyofauna. A variety of sampling techniques was utilized to survey the fish species of both the visually accessible megafauna and the camouflaged and small-sized species comprising the cryptic ichthyofauna. Based on results presented herein, the number of species known on Saba Bank is increased from 42 previously known species to 270 species. Expected species-accumulation curves demonstrate that the current estimate of species richness of fishes for Saba Bank under represents the actual richness, and our knowledge of the ichthyofauna has not plateaued. The total expected fish-species richness may be somewhere between 320 and 411 species. The Saba Bank ichthyofaunal assemblage is compared to fish assemblages found elsewhere in the Caribbean. Despite the absence of shallow or emergent shore habitats like mangroves, Saba Bank ranks as having the eighth highest ichthyofaunal richness of surveyed localities in the Greater Caribbean. Some degree of habitat heterogeneity was evident. Fore-reef, patch-reef, and lagoonal habitats were sampled. Fish assemblages were significantly different between habitats. Species richness was highest on the fore reef, but 11 species were found only at lagoonal sites. A comprehensive, annotated list of the fishes currently known to occur on Saba Bank, Netherland Antilles, is provided and color photographs of freshly collected specimens are presented for 165 of the listed species of Saba Bank fishes to facilitate identification and taxonomic comparison with similar taxa at other localities.

https://openalex.org/W2093414812,"It is well known that Auxin plays a key role in controlling many aspects of plant growth and development. Crystal structures of Transport inhibitor response 1 (TIR1), a true receptor of auxin, were very recently determined for TIR1 alone and in complexes with auxin and different synthetic analogues and an Auxin/Indole-3-Acetic Acid (Aux/IAA) substrate peptide. However, the dynamic conformational changes of the key residues of TIR1 that take place during the auxin and substrate perception by TIR1 and the detailed mechanism of these changes are still unclear. In the present study, various computational techniques were integrated to uncover the detailed molecular mechanism of the auxin and Aux/IAA perception process; these simulations included molecular dynamics (MD) simulations on complexes and the free enzyme, the molecular mechanics Poisson Boltzmann surface area (MM-PBSA) calculations, normal mode analysis, and hydrogen bond energy (HBE) calculations. The computational simulation results provided a reasonable explanation for the structure-activity relationships of auxin and its synthetic analogues in view of energy. In addition, a more detailed model for auxin and Aux/IAA perception was also proposed, indicating that Phe82 and Phe351 played a pivotal role in Aux/IAA perception. Upon auxin binding, Phe82 underwent conformational changes to accommodate the subsequent binding of Aux/IAA. As a result, auxin enhances the TIR1-Aux/IAA interactions by acting as a “molecular glue”. Besides, Phe351 acts as a “fastener” to further improve the substrate binding. The structural and mechanistic insights obtained from the present study will provide valuable clues for the future design of promising auxin analogues."
https://openalex.org/W2074517161,"Background Success of a viral infection requires that each infected cell delivers a sufficient number of infectious particles to allow new rounds of infection. In picornaviruses, viral replication is initiated by the viral polymerase and a viral-coded protein, termed VPg, that primes RNA synthesis. Foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) is exceptional among picornaviruses in that its genome encodes 3 copies of VPg. Why FMDV encodes three VPgs is unknown. Methodology and Principal Findings We have constructed four mutant FMDVs that encode only one VPg: either VPg1, VPg3, or two chimeric versions containing part of VPg1 and VPg3. All mutants, except that encoding only VPg1, were replication-competent. Unexpectedly, despite being replication-competent, the mutants did not form plaques on BHK-21 cell monolayers. The one-VPg mutant FMDVs released lower amounts of encapsidated viral RNA to the extracellular environment than wild type FMDV, suggesting that deficient plaque formation was associated with insufficient release of infectious progeny. Mutant FMDVs subjected to serial passages in BHK-21 cells regained plaque-forming capacity without modification of the number of copies of VPg. Substitutions in non-structural proteins 2C, 3A and VPg were associated with restoration of plaque formation. Specifically, replacement R55W in 2C was repeatedly found in several mutant viruses that had regained competence in plaque development. The effect of R55W in 2C was to mediate an increase in the extracellular viral RNA release without a detectable increase of total viral RNA that correlated with an enhanced capacity to alter and detach BHK-21 cells from the monolayer, the first stage of cell killing. Conclusions The results link the VPg copies in the FMDV genome with the cytopathology capacity of the virus, and have unveiled yet another function of 2C: modulation of picornavirus cell-to-cell transmission. Implications for picornaviruses pathogenesis are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W2087802063,"Saba Bank has always been an area of special importance to the neighboring island of Saba in the Netherlands Antilles. Sabans traditionally fished on the Bank as far back as 1907, but increasing foreign fishing pressures on the Bank in the 1970s and 1980s forced many Saban fishermen out. Concerns were compounded by the suspicion that shipping was also damaging the benthic habitat of the bank. Fishery legislation, enacted in 1996, brought an end to unlicensed fishing and established Coast Guard enforcement on the Bank, but also led to protests from neighboring countries that previously fished on the Bank. Research was necessary to support the need for protection. Review of available research of Saba Bank and rapid biological assessments and fisheries surveys since 1996 emphasized the richness of Saba Bank's biodiversity and the need for protection of fisheries stocks. The national nature policy plan recognized this and encouraged further research to base conservation measures on. Recent biological surveys of corals, fishes, and algae presented in this collection of articles emphasized habitat heterogeneity and the relative richness of the marine flora and fauna. These assessments formed the basis for a management plan to protect Saba Bank's biodiversity and a draft proposal to the International Maritime Organization (IMO) seeking Particularly Sensitive Sea Area (PSSA) status for the Bank. The intention of the PSSA proposal is to protect the benthic habitat on Saba Bank from anchor damage. This paper serves to provide the context for the results of the recent biodiversity surveys of Saba Bank. It is hoped that this collection will serve as a knowledge baseline and engender further research in the area."

The primary goals of the survey were to improve knowledge of biodiversity for one of the world's most significant, but little-known, seamounts and to increase basic data and analyses to promote the development of an improved management plan.Our team of three divers used scuba to collect algal samples to depths of 50 m at 17 dive sites. Over 360 macrophyte specimens (12 putative new species) were collected, more than 1,000 photographs were taken in truly exceptional habitats, and three astonishing new seaweed community types were discovered. These included: (1) ""Field of Greens"" (N 17 degrees 30.620', W 63 degrees 27.707') dominated by green seaweeds as well as some filamentous reds, (2) ""Brown Town"" (N 17 degrees 28.027', W 63 degrees 14.944') dominated by large brown algae, and (3) ""Seaweed City"" (N 17 degrees 26.485', W 63 degrees 16.850') with a diversity of spectacular fleshy red algae.Dives to 30 m in the more two-dimensional interior habitats revealed particularly robust specimens of algae typical of shallower seagrass beds, but here in the total absence of any seagrasses (seagrasses generally do not grow below 20 m). Our preliminary estimate of the number of total seaweed species on Saba Bank ranges from a minimum of 150 to 200. Few filamentous and thin sheet forms indicative of stressed or physically disturbed environments were observed. A more precise number still awaits further microscopic and molecular examinations in the laboratory.

Our structural and biochemical analyses suggest the catalytic mechanism of fRMsr in which Cys102 functions as the catalytic residue and Cys68 as the resolving Cys that forms a disulfide bond with Cys102.

Structural comparison reveals that conformational changes occur in the active site during catalysis, particularly in the loop of residues 97–106 containing the catalytic Cys102. We have also crystallized a complex between fRMsr and isopropyl alcohol, which acts as a competitive inhibitor for the enzyme. This isopropyl alcohol-bound structure helps us to understand the inhibitory mechanism of fRMsr.

https://openalex.org/W1981630666,"The benthic habitats of Saba Bank (17 degrees 25'N, 63 degrees 30'W) are at risk from maritime traffic, especially oil tankers (e.g., anchoring). To mitigate this risk, information is needed on the biodiversity and location of habitats to develop a zone use plan. A rapid survey to document the biodiversity of macro-algae, sponges, corals and fishes was conducted. Here we report on the richness and condition of stony coral species at 18 select sites, and we test for the effects of bottom type, depth, and distance from platform edge. Species richness was visually assessed by roving scuba diver with voucher specimens of each species collected. Coral tissue was examined for bleaching and diseases. Thirty-three coral species were documented. There were no significant differences in coral composition among bottom types or depth classes (ANOSIM, P>0.05). There was a significant difference between sites (ANOSIM, P<0.05) near and far from the platform edge. The number of coral species observed ranged from zero and one in algal dominated habitats to 23 at a reef habitat on the southern edge of the Bank. Five reef sites had stands of Acropora cervicornis, a critically endangered species on the IUCN redlist. Bleaching was evident at 82% of the sites assessed with 43 colonies bleached. Only three coral colonies were observed to have disease. Combining our findings with that of other studies, a total of 43 species have been documented from Saba Bank. The coral assemblage on the bank is representative and typical of those found elsewhere in the Caribbean. Although our findings will help develop effective protection, more information is needed on Saba Bank to create a comprehensive zone use plan. Nevertheless, immediate action is warranted to protect the diverse coral reef habitats documented here, especially those containing A. cervicornis."
https://openalex.org/W2015631464,"We have previously identified Semaphorin 6a (Sema6A) as an upregulated gene product in a gene expression screen in cortical ischemia [1]. Semaphorin 6a was regulated during the recovery phase following ischemia in the cortex. Semaphorin 6a is a member of the superfamily of semaphorins involved in axon guidance and other functions. We hypothesized that the upregulation indicates a crucial role of this molecule in post-stroke rewiring of the brain. Here we have tested this hypothesis by overexpressing semaphorin 6a in the cortex by microinjection of a modified AAV2-virus. A circumscribed cortical infarct was induced, and the recovery of rats monitored for up to 4 weeks using a well-established test battery (accelerated rotarod training paradigm, cylinder test, adhesive tape removal). We observed a significant improvement in post-ischemic recovery of animals injected with the semaphorin 6a virus versus animals treated with a control virus. We conclude that semaphorin 6a overexpressed in the cortex enhances recovery after cerebral ischemia. Semaphorin 6a may represent a novel therapeutic candidate for the treatment of chronic stroke."
https://openalex.org/W2111387347,"HLA, the most genetically diverse loci in the human genome, play a crucial role in host-pathogen interaction by mediating innate and adaptive cellular immune responses. A vast number of infectious diseases affect East Africa, including HIV/AIDS, malaria, and tuberculosis, but the HLA genetic diversity in this region remains incompletely described. This is a major obstacle for the design and evaluation of preventive vaccines. Available HLA typing techniques, that provide the 4-digit level resolution needed to interpret immune responses, lack sufficient throughput for large immunoepidemiological studies. Here we present a novel HLA typing assay bridging the gap between high resolution and high throughput. The assay is based on real-time PCR using sequence-specific primers (SSP) and can genotype carriers of the 49 most common East African class I HLA-A, -B, and -C alleles, at the 4-digit level. Using a validation panel of 175 samples from Kampala, Uganda, previously defined by sequence-based typing, the new assay performed with 100% sensitivity and specificity. The assay was also implemented to define the HLA genetic complexity of a previously uncharacterized Tanzanian population, demonstrating its inclusion in the major East African genetic cluster. The availability of genotyping tools with this capacity will be extremely useful in the identification of correlates of immune protection and the evaluation of candidate vaccine efficacy."
https://openalex.org/W2042110130,"Conservationists frequently use nest count surveys to estimate great ape population densities, yet the accuracy and precision of the resulting estimates are difficult to assess.We used mathematical simulations to model nest building behavior in an orangutan population to compare the quality of the population size estimates produced by two of the commonly used nest count methods, the 'marked recount method' and the 'matrix method.' We found that when observers missed even small proportions of nests in the first survey, the marked recount method produced large overestimates of the population size. Regardless of observer reliability, the matrix method produced substantial overestimates of the population size when surveying effort was low. With high observer reliability, both methods required surveying approximately 0.26% of the study area (0.26 km(2) out of 100 km(2) in this simulation) to achieve an accurate estimate of population size; at or above this sampling effort both methods produced estimates within 33% of the true population size 50% of the time. Both methods showed diminishing returns at survey efforts above 0.26% of the study area. The use of published nest decay estimates derived from other sites resulted in widely varying population size estimates that spanned nearly an entire order of magnitude. The marked recount method proved much better at detecting population declines, detecting 5% declines nearly 80% of the time even in the first year of decline.These results highlight the fact that neither nest surveying method produces highly reliable population size estimates with any reasonable surveying effort, though either method could be used to obtain a gross population size estimate in an area. Conservation managers should determine if the quality of these estimates are worth the money and effort required to produce them, and should generally limit surveying effort to 0.26% of the study area, unless specific management goals require more intensive sampling. Using site- and time- specific nest decay rates (or the marked recount method) are essential for accurate population size estimation. Marked recount survey methods with sufficient sampling effort hold promise for detecting population declines."
https://openalex.org/W2018250126,"Autoregulation is one of the mechanisms of imparting feedback control on gene expression. Positive autoregulatory feedback results in induction of a gene, and negative feedback leads to its suppression. Here, we report an interesting mechanism of autoregulation operating on Drosophila Rel gene dorsal that can activate as well as repress its expression. Using biochemical and genetic approaches, we show that upon immune challenge Dorsal regulates its activation as well as repression by dynamically binding to two different κB motifs, κBI (intronic κB) and κBP (promoter κB), present in the dorsal gene. Although the κBI motif functions as an enhancer, the κBP motif acts as a transcriptional repressor. Interestingly, Dorsal binding to these two motifs is dynamic; immediately upon immune challenge, Dorsal binds to the κBI leading to auto-activation, whereas at the terminal phase of the immune response, it is removed from the κBI and repositioned at the κBP, resulting in its repression. Furthermore, we show that repression of Dorsal as well as its binding to the κBP depends on the transcription factor AP1. Depletion of AP1 by RNA interference resulted in constitutive expression of Dorsal. In conclusion, this study suggests that during acute phase response dorsal is regulated by following two subcircuits: (i) Dl-κBI for activation and (ii) Dl-AP1-κBP for repression. These two subcircuits are temporally delineated and bring about overall regulation of dorsal during immune response.

These results suggest the presence of a previously unknown mechanism of Dorsal autoregulation in immune-challenged Drosophila. Insects have evolved simple yet multipronged strategies to defend themselves against microbial invasion. The mechanisms that regulate the different arms of insect immunity have been well investigated in Drosophila melanogaster (1Tzou P. De Gregorio E. Lemaitre B. Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 2002; 5: 102-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). To combat microbial challenge, Drosophila relies on multiple defense reactions, which partly resemble the innate immune response of higher organisms (2Brennan C.A. Anderson K.V. Annu. Rev.

Such a conserved innate immune pathway suggests ancient origin of immune response during metazoan evolution. Because of this evolutionary conservation, Drosophila has emerged as a model for studying common innate immune mechanisms in animals (5Dushay M.S. Eldon E.D. Am. J. Hum.

For example, homologues of the cell surface receptor protein Toll of Drosophila, and its downstream signaling pathway, are present in mammals as well. Activation of the Toll pathway leads to synthesis of antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) 3The abbreviations used are: AMPanti-microbial protein/peptideTSStranscription start siteLPSlipopolysaccharidePGNpeptidoglycanhpihours post-infectionChIPchromatin immunoprecipitationEMSAelectrophoretic mobility shift assayRNAiRNA interferencePBSphosphate-buffered salineGFPgreen fluorescent proteindsRNAdouble strand RNA. in both insects and mammals (3Hoffmann J.A.

The hallmark of Drosophila immune defense is the infection-induced synthesis and secretion of a battery of AMPs into the hemolymph by the fat body (8Lemaitre B. Hoffmann J. Annu. Rev.

To understand induction of AMP genes upon activation of Toll/Imd pathway, regulatory elements in their promoters were analyzed and mapped. The analysis revealed the presence and requirement of DNA motifs resembling the κB motifs of mammals for inducibility of immune genes upon infection in Drosophila (13Engström Y. Kadalayil L. Sun S.C. Samakovlis C. Hultmark D. Faye I. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 232: 327-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Later, three NF-κB/Rel-like proteins were also identified in Drosophila (14Rushlow C. Warrior R. BioEssays. 1992; 14: 89-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Two of these, Dorsal (Dl) and Dif, encoded by two clustered genes, are part of the Toll pathway signaling induced upon infection by Gram-positive bacteria or fungi (15Manfruelli P. Reichhart J.M. Steward R. Hoffmann J.A. Lemaitre B. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3380-3391Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar, 16Meng X. Khanuja B.S. Ip Y.T. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 792-797Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). Relish, the third member of this family, regulates induction of AMPs of the Imd pathway upon infection by Gram-negative bacteria (14Rushlow C. Warrior R.

U.S.A. 1996; 93: 10343-10347Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). Dif and Dorsal play redundant roles in regulating expression of drosomycin, a Toll pathway AMP gene, at the larval stage, whereas Dif alone mediates drosomycin expression in adults (15Manfruelli P. Reichhart J.M. Steward R. Hoffmann J.A. Lemaitre B. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3380-3391Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar, 16Meng X. Khanuja B.S. Ip Y.T. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 792-797Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). In Drosophila, activation of Toll upon microbial infection involves the recruitment of the adaptor protein Myd88, leading to the activation of the kinase Pelle and subsequent phosphorylation and degradation of Cactus, the cytoplasmic inhibitor of Dorsal and Dif, which brings about rapid nuclear translocation of these two transcription factors (17Dushay M.S. Asling B. Hultmark D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1996; 93: 10343-10347Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar, 18Lemaitre B. Nicolas E. Michaut L. Reichhart J.M. Hoffmann J.A. Cell. 1996; 86: 973-983Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2930) Google Scholar). Dorsal also acts as a morphogen during embryonic development (19Govind S. Steward R. Trends Genet. 1991; 7: 119-125Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). In the early embryo, degradation of Cactus, upon developmental cues arising from activation of Toll, allows Dorsal to enter the nuclei along the dorso-ventral axis in a gradient. Formation of Dorsal gradient is important for the regulation of target gene expression involved in dorso-ventral patterning (19Govind S. Steward R. Trends Genet. 1991; 7: 119-125Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). However, the Toll signaling cascade controlling the AMP response differs from the dorso-ventral patterning pathway at the following two levels: (i) regulation by the serine proteases acting upstream of Spätzle in the signaling pathway, and (ii) use of Dif for immune response in the fat body, rather than Dorsal, which has a role in embryogenesis (8Lemaitre B. Hoffmann J. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2007; 25: 697-743Crossref PubMed Scopus (2262) Google Scholar, 10Engström Y. Dev. Comp.

Cell. 1996; 86: 973-983Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2930) Google Scholar). Dorsal is a bifunctional transcription factor as it activates as well as suppresses transcription of target genes involved in embryonic development (20Ratnaparkhi G.S. Jia S. Courey A.J. Development. 2006; 133: 4409-4414Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 21Pan D. Courey A.J. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 1837-1842Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 22Ip Y.T. Park R.E. Kosman D. Yazdanbakhsh K. Levine M. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 1518-1530Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). For example, the twist enhancer region in Drosophila has multiple Dorsal-binding sites and is activated by Dorsal (23Ip Y.T. Kraut R. Levine M. Rushlow C.A. Cell. 1991; 64: 439-446Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 24Jiang J. Kosman D. Ip Y.T. Levine M. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 1881-1891Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar), whereas Dorsal-binding sites in the zen promoter act as repressor elements (22Ip Y.T. Park R.E. Kosman D. Yazdanbakhsh K. Levine M. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 1518-1530Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). Point mutations in the Dorsal-binding motifs of the twist enhancer reduce ventral activation, whereas mutations in the Dorsal-binding sites in the zen silencer abolish ventral repression. These results suggest bi-functionality of Dorsal as a transcriptional activator as well as transcriptional repressor in vivo (20Ratnaparkhi G.S. Jia S. Courey A.J.

Although there are many reports that emphasize regulation of Dorsal target genes, regulation of the dorsal (dl) gene itself has not been investigated thus far (27Biemar F. Nix D.A. Piel J. Peterson B. Ronshaugen M. Sementchenko V. Bell I. Manak J.R. Levine M.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2006; 103: 12763-12768Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 28Senger K. Armstrong G.W.

We are interested in understanding the molecular basis of sex-biased immune response in insects. While deciphering the molecular basis of the sex-biased immune response, we observed differential activation of Drosophila Rel proteins in the two sexes. We found that sex-differential activation of Rel proteins is modulated at different levels, including autoregulation (data not shown). In this study, we provide insights into the molecular mechanism underlying autoregulation of dl. We show that dl autoregulation is achieved by two different κB sites, a canonical κB motif (κBI) located in the first intron of dl and another functional but noncanonical κB motif (κBP) present upstream of the transcription start site (TSS). We show that the κBI motif acts as an enhancer, whereas the κBP motif is essential for the repression of dl at the termination of acute phase response. We found that Dorsal binding to the two motifs is dynamic and is temporally regulated. Immediately after immune challenge, Dorsal protein binds to the κBI motif, which results in immediate and strong expression of dl gene. However, later in acute phase response, Dorsal binding was located at the κBP motif and not at the κBI motif. Further analysis suggested that dl expression at the onset of acute phase response was regulated by Dorsal alone; however, its repression at the end of acute phase response required interaction with another transcription factor AP1. Drosophila AP1 is a homodimer or heterodimer of Jra (Jun-related antigen) and Fra (Fos-related antigen). Here, we show that Drosophila AP1 acts as a co-repressor in dl regulation. w1118 flies were used as standard wild type strain. dl1 flies were obtained from Bloomington Stock Centre. All stocks were maintained and the experiments performed at 25 °C. Drs::gfp transgenic flies were provided by Bruno Lemaitre, CNRS, France. Third instar wandering stage Drosophila larvae, maintained at 25 °C, were infected with the Gram-positive bacterium Micrococcus luteus by pricking with a sharp needle dipped in a bacterial pellet with absorbance of ∼100. Drosophila S2 cells were immune-challenged by adding 50 μg of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) (Sigma) and 50 μg of peptidoglycan (PGN) (Sigma) per well containing ∼1 × 106 cells. Embryonic nuclear extracts were prepared by homogenizing embryos (2–4-h-old) in extraction buffer (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EGTA, 12.5% sucrose, 25% glycerol, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and protease inhibitor mixture) using a Dounce homogenizer, followed by centrifugation at 3000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. The precipitated nuclei were suspended in 1 ml of extraction buffer. For EMSA, 100 ng each of different double-stranded oligonucleotide probes was labeled with 2 μl of [γ-32P]ATP (5 × 105 cpm) and 1 μl of polynucleotide kinase (10 units/μl) in 1 μl of PNK buffer (New England Biolabs) for 1 h at 37 °C. The labeled DNA was purified, and binding reaction was performed for 45 min at room temperature by mixing 1 ng of purified 32P-labeled double-stranded synthetic oligonucleotide probe (4000 cpm/μl), 10 μl of nuclear extracts, and 300 ng of poly(dI-dC) in the presence of a protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma). Cold competition was performed by preincubating the extracts with a 50-fold excess of unlabeled oligonucleotide for 15 min at room temperature. For supershift experiment, anti-mouse Dorsal monoclonal antibody was added to the binding reaction for 30 min. The binding reaction was analyzed by electrophoresis on a 6% native polyacrylamide gel. The probe sequences are as follows: for κBP, ATGAGTCACAGAAAAACAAGAAAAACA; for mut-κB, ATGAGTCACAGAATAATCCAGAATAATCC, and for κBI, GGGAATTCCGGGAATTCCGGGAATTCC. These experiments were performed essentially according to the protocols mentioned previously (29Mrinal N. Nagaraju J. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 23376-23387Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Briefly, Dorsal was immunodepleted from the embryonic extract using anti-Dorsal monoclonal antibody obtained from Drosophila Studies Hybridoma Bank in a 100-μl final volume of buffer containing 30 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.4, 100 mm KOAc, 2 mm Mg(OAc)2, 2 mm dithiothreitol, and protease inhibitor mixture. Dorsal-depleted supernatant was collected and used immediately for coupled in vitro transcription and translation reaction. Different luciferase constructs (1 μg each) were used for coupled in vitro transcription and translation. These plasmids were incubated with cell extracts prepared from LPS- and PGN-treated S2 cells. Additional supplements added in the reaction were RNase inhibitor, Mg2+, ATP, and amino acid mix as mentioned in Ref. 29Mrinal N. Nagaraju J. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 23376-23387Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar. After adding all the components, the reaction was carried out for minimum of 2 h followed by Western analysis and/or luciferase assay. Whole embryo extracts were prepared from 0- to 4-h-old dechorionated embryos in extraction buffer A (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 140 mm NaCl, 5 mm Mg(CH3COO)2, 0.05% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 mg of pepstatin A/ml, 10 mg of aprotinin/ml, and 1 mg of leupeptin/ml) at 40 °C. Cell extracts containing 50 μg of protein were separated on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. The proteins were electrophoretically transferred to a Hybond-P membrane (Amersham Biosciences) using a Trans-blot cell (Bio-Rad), at 200 mA overnight at 4 °C. The blots were stained for total protein by Ponceau S (Sigma) and blocked in 10% nonfat dry milk in 0.5% Tween 20, 0.05% SDS in PBS (Blocking buffer). The blots were incubated for 6 h at room temperature in primary antibodies and then washed four times for 10 min in Tween 20 + PBS followed by a 2-h incubation at room temperature with the secondary antibody (Sigma). The blots were then washed three times for 30 min in Tween 20 + PBS and rinsed once in PBS. Anti-Dorsal monoclonal antibody in a 1:500 dilution was used for probing. The protein bands were detected using horseradish peroxidase-enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL, Amersham Biosciences). The enhancer fragments were PCR-amplified from Drosophila genomic DNA with a 5′ primer containing a KpnI site and a 3′ primer containing an XhoI site and cloned into pGL3 Basic vector. (Primer information is provided as supplemental Information 1.) Cloned inserts were verified by restriction digestion and sequencing. P3 is a full-length promoter construct (1.25-kb-long region upstream to TSS) with three κB motifs. We also generated a full-length enhancer construct with both upstream and downstream regulatory regions. The plasmid P3-Ex1-In1-Ex2 contained the exon1, intron1, and part of exon2 apart from the 1.25-kb-long promoter region. To generate ΔκBP plasmid, the NsiI recognition sequence surrounding the κBP motif (AGAAAAACA) in the control P3-Ex1-In1-Ex2 plasmid was used to delete this motif by incubating with NsiI enzyme (New England Biolabs) followed by self-ligation. The same restriction site was used to insert the mutant κBP motif harboring NsiI recognition sequence on either side of the mutant kappaB motif sequence (AGAATAATC) in P3-Ex1-In1-Ex2 plasmid that generated the plasmid κBPmut. For motif swap experiment, the κBI motif was cloned into the NsiI sites surrounding the κBP motif. To generate κBImut plasmid, the mutant κBI motif, GGGAAATAC, was used to replace the wild type κBI (GGGAATTCC) by site-directed mutagenesis using QuickChange II site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) according to manufacturer's protocol. The mutated nucleotides of the κBI motif as part of the primer for site-directed mutagenesis are shown in boldface and underlined. To obtain ΔAP1 motif plasmid (AP1-del), the AP1 motif cluster in the control P3-Ex1-In1-Ex2 plasmid was deleted by restriction digestion with MmeI only or both MmeI and NaeI. All the plasmids were purified using Qiagen columns. Drosophila immune-competent Schneider (S2) cells were maintained at 25 °C in Schneider's Insect Cell Media (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen). For transfections, cells were seeded in 6-well plates at a density of 1 × 106 cells/ml. A day later, transfection was carried out using FuGENE transfection reagent (Roche Applied Science) without removing the plasmids. 12 h post-transfection, 50 μg of LPS (Sigma) and 50 μg of PGN (Sigma) were added per well, and the cells were harvested at different time points. Cell extracts were prepared in lysis buffer (Promega), and luciferase activity was measured according to manufacturer's instructions (Promega) on a luminometer. For luciferase assay, 100 μl of the reaction mixture/cell extract was added to 500 μl of luciferase reagent at room temperature. Luminometer was programmed to perform a 2-s measurement delay followed by a 10-s measurement. RNAi strategy was used to knockdown Drosophila AP1. Both AP1 components jra and fra of Drosophila were targeted as they can act either as homodimer or heterodimer. 219-bp region of the jra and 239 bp of fra open reading frames were amplified and cloned into TOPOII PCR cloning vector (Invitrogen) (supplemental Information 1). Double strand RNA was synthesized by in vitro transcription using T7 and SP6 RNA polymerases and annealed after ethanol precipitation. For RNAi, 1 × 106 Drosophila S2 cells were plated, washed with serum-free medium, and incubated in the same medium for 5–6 h. 5 μg of dsRNA, at 25 μg/ml concentration, was used for transfection. All transfections were done using FuGENE transfection reagent (Roche Applied Science) according to manufacturer's protocol. The protocol followed for ChIP was essentially as mentioned on the flychip website with the following modifications. S2 cells were fixed by cross-linking with 1% formaldehyde followed by lysis in SDS lysis buffer and sonication. Fragmented chromatin was centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 45 min; soluble fraction was collected and later used for immunoprecipitation performed with anti-Dorsal monoclonal antibody. DNA was purified using Qiagen columns and later used in PCR. All PCRs were done at 62 °C for 30 cycles. The following primers were used for ChIP assay: primers used for amplifying κBI motif, forward primer CAAAGAAAATGGAGGGCAGA and the reverse primer AAGAGAGAGTGGGCAAAGAGC. This primer pair amplifies 177-bp PCR product. Primers for amplifying κBP motif forward primer TTGGTTACCATACAGTTGAATTCTCA and reverse primer AGGAATGCAGGCCAGTTGTT amplify a 196-bp PCR product. Both primer sets were standardized to amplify at Tm 62 °C and were thus used in multiplex PCR. Regulation of insect Rel genes is poorly understood. In silico analysis of regulatory sequences upstream of the transcription start sites of the three Drosophila Rel genes suggested the presence of putative binding sites for transcription factors like Dfd, Hb, Ftz, and BrCZ, but none of these is known to regulate immune response. However, one interesting prediction was the presence of κB motifs, which are known to be involved in regulation of immune response, in all three Rel gene promoters. GATA is another important regulator of immune response genes (30Tingvall T.O. Roos E. Engström Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2001; 98: 3884-3888Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 31Senger K. Harris K. Levine M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2006; 103: 15957-159562Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). In a recent study, the existence and importance of a Rel-GATA module in the promoters of immune response genes, including AMP genes, was shown (28Senger K. Armstrong G.W. Rowell W.J. Kwan J.M. Markstein M. Levine M. Mol. Cell. 2004; 13: 19-32Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 30Tingvall T.O. Roos E. Engström Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2001; 98: 3884-3888Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). These GATA factors also impart tissue specificity and are known to modulate expression of AMP genes upon microbial infection (31Senger K. Harris K. Levine M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2006; 103: 15957-159562Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The presence of GATA motifs within 50 bp around the κB site, including their orientation with respect to the κB motif, was shown to be crucial for activation of AMP genes by Rel proteins upon immune challenge (28Senger K. Armstrong G.W. Rowell W.J. Kwan J.M. Markstein M. Levine M. Mol. Cell. 2004; 13: 19-32Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). The same Rel-GATA module was also found in the promoters of Dorsal target genes zen, rent, Ady, and fas3, which are expressed during embryonic stages, suggesting a common regulatory module in the Dorsal target genes (28Senger K. Armstrong G.W. Rowell W.J. Kwan J.M. Markstein M. Levine M. Mol. Cell. 2004; 13: 19-32Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). However, we did not find any Rel-GATA module either in the vicinity or far away from the κB motif in the three Rel gene promoters. Thus, absence of the Rel-GATA module is a major difference between regulation of Rel genes and Rel target genes. We also found that the three Rel genes lacked TATA elements in their promoters. On the contrary, Rel target immune response genes have TATA elements as their basal promoters. Furthermore, relish and DIF promoters have a single canonical κB motif in their promoters; however, the same is not true for the dl gene, which has multiple κB motifs (supplemental Information 2 and supplemental Fig. 1). In light of this observation, we were interested to know how Rel genes are regulated. Here, we investigated transcriptional regulation of dl expression during acute phase immune response, both in vitro and in vivo. Dorsal, which is a maternally expressed gene product, plays an important role in dorso-ventral patterning of the early embryo and also regulates expression of the antibacterial gene drosomycin in the bacteria-challenged larvae of Drosophila. However, induction of drosomycin, upon microbial infection, is compromised in dl1 mutant flies indicating absence of functional Dorsal (10Engström Y. Dev. Comp. Immunol. 1999; 23: 345-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 15Manfruelli P. Reichhart J.M. Steward R. Hoffmann J.A. Lemaitre B. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3380-3391Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar, 18Lemaitre B. Nicolas E. Michaut L. Reichhart J.M. Hoffmann J.A. Cell. 1996; 86: 973-983Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2930) Google Scholar). dl1 mutant is a loss-of-function (amorphic) mutation and shows a dorsalized embryo phenotype that ranges from D0 (completely dorsalized) to D3 (weakly dorsalized) (19Govind S. Steward R. Trends Genet. 1991; 7: 119-125Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). In the D0 phenotype, the cuticles of embryos lack ventral denticle belts, Filzkörper, and consist only of a tube of dorsal epidermis. At the outset, we checked the status of Dorsal expression in dl1 flies. Interestingly, in comparison with w1118 flies, the level of Dorsal in extracts prepared from dl1 embryos was extremely low or absent (Fig. 1A). Absence of the Dorsal protein in dl1 mutant could be due to the following: (i) instability of dorsal transcript or (ii) lack of Dorsal expression. We tested these two possibilities, in vitro, by luciferase reporter assay. The luciferase reporter plasmid used in this study consists of the dl regulatory region until the second exon of dl. Coupled in vitro transcription and translation of this reporter led to synthesis of luciferase with w1118 embryonic extract but not with extracts from the mutant dl1 embryos (Fig. 1B). This result is consistent with the result shown in Fig. 1A where a negligible amount of Dorsal was present in the dl1 extract (Fig. 1, A and B) suggesting that dl promoter is not inducible in dl1 embryonic extract. This result also implies that absence of Dorsal in Fig. 1A and luciferase in Fig. 1B, both under the regulation of dl promoter, is due to lack of expression of respective genes. Thus, emphasizing that reason for lack of Dorsal in dl1 embryo is dl deregulation and not mRNA instability. Lack of Dorsal in the dl1 mutant can be explained if we assume that Dorsal regulates expression of its own gene, i.e. dl gene is autoregulated (Fig. 1, A and B). If Dorsal regulates its own expression, then depleting wild type Dorsal from w1118 embryonic extract should also result in no synthesis of luciferase. To test this hypothesis, we performed an immunodepletion experiment where wild type Dorsal was depleted from the w1118 embryonic extracts using anti-Dorsal monoclonal antibody. The Dorsal-depleted w1118 embryonic extract failed to s"
