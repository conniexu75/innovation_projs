We have recently proposed that endothelial cells can serve as innate immune cells, but the molecular mechanisms involved still await discovery. Here, we investigated whether human aortic endothelial cells (HAECs) could be transdifferentiated into innate immune cells by exposing them to hyperlipidemia–up-regulated DAMP molecules, i.e. lysophospholipids. Performing RNA-seq analysis of lysophospholipid-treated HAECs, we found that lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC) and lysophosphatidylinositol (LPI) regulate largely distinct gene programs as revealed by principal component analysis. Metabolically, LPC up-regulated genes that are involved in cholesterol biosynthesis, presumably through sterol regulatory element–binding protein 2 (SREBP2). By contrast, LPI up-regulated gene transcripts critical for the metabolism of glucose, lipids, and amino acids. Of note, we found that LPC and LPI both induce adhesion molecules, cytokines, and chemokines, which are all classic markers of endothelial cell activation, in HAECs. Moreover, LPC and LPI shared the ability to transdifferentiate HAECs into innate immune cells, including induction of potent DAMP receptors, such as CD36 molecule, T-cell costimulation/coinhibition receptors, and MHC-II proteins. The induction of these innate-immunity signatures by lysophospholipids correlated with their ability to induce up-regulation of cytosolic calcium and mitochondrial reactive oxygen species. In conclusion, lysophospholipids such as LPC and LPI induce innate immune cell transdifferentiation in HAECs. The concept of prolonged endothelial activation, discovered here, is relevant for designing new strategies for managing cardiovascular diseases.

https://openalex.org/W2803220933,"The adipose tissue (AT) contributes to systemic and B cell intrinsic inflammation, reduced B cell responses and secretion of autoimmune antibodies. In this study we show that adipocytes in the human obese subcutaneous AT (SAT) secrete several pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, which contribute to the establishment and maintenance of local and systemic inflammation, and consequent suboptimal immune responses in obese individuals, as we have previously shown. We also show that pro-inflammatory chemokines recruit immune cells expressing the corresponding receptors to the SAT, where they also contribute to local and systemic inflammation, secreting additional pro-inflammatory mediators. Moreover, we show that the SAT generates autoimmune antibodies. During the development of obesity, reduced oxygen and consequent hypoxia and cell death lead to further release of pro-inflammatory cytokines, self protein antigens, cell-free DNA and lipids. All these stimulate class switch and the production of autoimmune IgG antibodies which have been described to be pathogenic. In addition to hypoxia, we have measured cell cytotoxicity and DNA damage mechanisms, which may also contribute to the release of self antigens in the SAT. All these processes are significantly elevated in the SAT as compared to the blood. We definitively found that fat-specific IgG antibodies are secreted by B cells in the SAT and that B cells express mRNA for the transcription factor T-bet and the membrane marker CD11c, both involved in the production of autoimmune IgG antibodies. Finally, the SAT also expresses RNA for cytokines known to promote Germinal Center formation, isotype class switch, and plasma cell differentiation. Our results show novel mechanisms for the generation of autoimmune antibody responses in the human SAT and allow the identification of new pathways to possibly manipulate in order to reduce systemic inflammation and autoantibody production in obese individuals."

The peptides bind to MHC-I in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), and this binding is facilitated by the peptide loading complex (PLC), which contains calreticulin (CRT). CRT associates with MHC-I via a conserved glycan present on MHC-I and recruits it to the PLC for peptide binding. Somatic frameshift mutations in CRT (CRT-FS) drive the proliferation of a subset of myeloproliferative neoplasms, which are chronic blood tumors. All CRT-FS proteins have a C-terminal sequence lacking the normal ER-retention signal and possessing a net negative charge rather than the normal positive charge. We characterized the effect of CRT-FS on antigen presentation by MHC-I in human cells. Our results indicate that CRT-FS cannot mediate CRT's peptide loading function in the PLC. Cells lacking CRT exhibited reduced surface MHC-I levels, consistent with reduced binding of high-affinity peptides, and this was not reversed by CRT-FS expression. CRT-FS was secreted and not detectably associated with the PLC, leading to poor MHC-I recruitment, although CRT-FS could still associate with MHC-I in a glycan-dependent manner. The addition of an ER-retention sequence to CRT-FS restored its association with the PLC but did not rescue MHC-I recruitment or its surface expression, indicating that the CRT-FS mutants functionally compromise the PLC. MHC-I down-regulation permits tumor cells to evade immune surveillance, and these findings may therefore be relevant for designing effective immunotherapies for managing myeloproliferative neoplasms.

Each MHC-I molecule is a heterodimer composed of a transmembrane heavy chain and β2-microglobulin (β2m) that is associated with a short 8–11-amino acid peptide. These peptides are derived from cellular proteins and are presented on the surface of cells in a process called antigen presentation (1Blum J.S. Wearsch P.A. Cresswell P. Pathways of antigen processing.Annu. Rev.

Cells presenting peptides derived from “self” proteins are generally ignored, whereas cells presenting peptides derived from foreign proteins (e.g. virally infected cells) can be recognized and destroyed. In the case of cancer cells, presentation of peptides derived from tumor-associated antigens or tumor-specific antigens by MHC-I may occur, facilitating their identification and killing by CD8+ T cells (1Blum J.S. Wearsch P.A. Cresswell P. Pathways of antigen processing.Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2013; 31 (23298205): 443-47310.1146/annurev-immunol-032712-095910Crossref PubMed Scopus (928) Google Scholar, 2Leone P.

In an attempt to evade immune surveillance, cancer cells employ various mechanisms to down-regulate the expression of MHC-I molecules or other proteins directly or indirectly involved in antigen processing and presentation (2Leone P.

Down-regulation is more common than total elimination of MHC-I expression because the latter renders the cell susceptible to the action of natural killer (NK) cells; reduction of surface MHC-I may allow evasion of NK-mediated killing, and reduced antigen presentation can prevent efficient detection by CD8+ T cells (3Beatty G.L. Gladney W.L. Immune escape mechanisms as a guide for cancer immunotherapy.Clin. Cancer Res. 2015; 21 (25501578): 687-69210.1158/1078-0432.CCR-14-1860Crossref PubMed Scopus (592) Google Scholar). In addition, β2m associated with MHC-I on the cell surface may inhibit phagocytosis of cells by macrophages even if they express other pro-phagocytic markers (4Barkal A.A. Weiskopf K. Kao K.S.

The success of various immune-based therapies, such as DNA vaccines, checkpoint inhibitor antibody therapy, or dendritic cell therapy (5Hofmann S. Babiak A. Greiner J. Immunotherapy for myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN).Curr. Cancer Drug Targets. 2011; 11 (21062247): 72-8410.2174/156800911793743682Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar, 6Nagler E. Xavier M.F.

It is therefore important to understand the mechanisms by which antigen presentation is altered in tumor cells to aid their effective targeting and elimination. Assembly and peptide loading of MHC-I molecules occurs in the ER, facilitated by the peptide loading complex (PLC) (1Blum J.S. Wearsch P.A. Cresswell P. Pathways of antigen processing.Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2013; 31 (23298205): 443-47310.1146/annurev-immunol-032712-095910Crossref PubMed Scopus (928) Google Scholar, 7Blees A. Januliene D. Hofmann T. Koller N. Schmidt C. Trowitzsch S. Moeller A.

The core components of the PLC are ERp57, tapasin, and the dimeric transporter associated with antigen processing (TAP). ERp57 is a thiol-reductase that functions together with calreticulin (CRT), a lectin chaperone, in the quality control folding cycle used for many glycoproteins (8Oliver J.D. van der Wal F.J. Bulleid N.J. High S. Interaction of the thiol-dependent reductase ERp57 with nascent glycoproteins.Science. 1997; 275 (8974399): 86-8810.1126/science.275.5296.86Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). Two tapasin molecules associate directly with TAP, and both are disulfide-linked to ERp57 (7Blees A. Januliene D. Hofmann T. Koller N. Schmidt C. Trowitzsch S. Moeller A. Tampé R.

Although CRT is a constituent of the PLC, its association depends on the presence of MHC-I molecules, which bind peptides that are derived primarily from cytosolic proteolysis and are imported into the ER by TAP. Tapasin facilitates peptide exchange, leading to the accumulation of MHC-I molecules associated with high-affinity peptides, and its mechanism of action has recently been illuminated by the structural analysis of its homolog TAPBPR in association with MHC-I (10Jiang J. Natarajan K. Boyd L.F. Morozov G.I. Mage M.G. Margulies D.H. Crystal structure of a TAPBPR-MHC I complex reveals the mechanism of peptide editing in antigen presentation.Science. 2017; 358 (29025991): 1064-106810.1126/science.aao5154Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 11Thomas C.

TAPBPR is not a PLC component. Cancer cells have been shown to down-regulate the expression of TAP, tapasin, CRT, ERp57, MHC heavy chain, or β2m by various mechanisms that ultimately lead to the loss or reduced expression of MHC-I on the cell surface (2Leone P. Shin E.C. Perosa F. Vacca A. Dammacco F. Racanelli V. MHC class I antigen processing and presenting machinery: organization, function, and defects in tumor cells.J. Natl.

This study is focused on the effects of disease-associated CRT mutations on antigen presentation by MHC-I. CRT is a multidomain protein with an N-terminal lectin domain, a central, proline-rich P-domain that interacts with ERp57, and an acidic C-terminal domain (CTD) that binds calcium ions and ends with an ER-retention sequence (KDEL) (Fig. 1A). The MHC-I heavy chain bears an N-linked glycan at a site that is conserved across species and, when monoglucosylated, is responsible for its association with CRT (12Wearsch P.A. Jakob C.A. Vallin A. Dwek R.A. Rudd P.M. Cresswell P. Major histocompatibility complex class I molecules expressed with monoglucosylated N-linked glycans bind calreticulin independently of their assembly status.J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279 (15056662): 25112-2512110.1074/jbc.M401721200Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). This glycan is also a target of the ER-resident enzyme UDP-glucosyltransferase 1 (UGT1). UGT1 detects MHC-I loaded with a suboptimal, low-affinity peptide and reglucosylates the glycan, causing the MHC-I to reinteract with the PLC via CRT (13Wearsch P.A. Peaper D.R. Cresswell P. Essential glycan-dependent interactions optimize MHC class I peptide loading.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2011; 108 (21383180): 4950-495510.1073/pnas.1102524108Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). This facilitates further iterations of peptide loading until an optimal peptide is loaded. Earlier reports have shown that CRT, in combination with other PLC components, is often down-regulated in colorectal (14Dierssen J.W. de Miranda N.F. Ferrone S. van Puijenbroek M. Cornelisse C.J. Fleuren G.J. van Wezel T. Morreau H. HNPCC versus sporadic microsatellite-unstable colon cancers follow different routes toward loss of HLA class I expression.BMC Cancer. 2007; 7 (17316446): 3310.1186/1471-2407-7-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) and bladder cancers (15Cathro H.P.

In 2013, a somatic, frameshift mutant of CRT (CRT-FS) was identified in myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs), a class of chronic blood diseases (16Nangalia J. Massie C.E. Baxter E.J. Nice F.L.

MPNs that are Philadelphia chromosome–negative and myeloproliferative leukemia virus oncogene–negative can be further categorized into three classes: polycythemia vera (PV), essential thrombocythemia (ET), and primary myelofibrosis (PMF). An activating mutation in Janus kinase 2 (JAK2V617F) is seen in 95% of PV patients, whereas only 50–60% of patients suffering from ET or PMF have this mutation. The two studies mentioned above discovered that the majority of ET or PMF patients with nonmutated JAK2 carry insertions or deletions in exon 9 of the CALR gene, all of which result in a 1-bp frameshift mutation that generates a novel C-terminal tail of CRT, of which 36 amino acids are common between all types of CALR mutations (16Nangalia J.

The amino acids in the mutant sequence are basic in nature compared with the acidic amino acids present in CRT-WT, and the ER-retention sequence, KDEL, present in WT is lost (Fig. 1A). The majority of patients are heterozygous for this mutation, but homozygous mutations have been reported in small cohorts (17Klampfl T. Gisslinger H. Harutyunyan A.S. Nivarthi H. Rumi E.

The C-terminal tail of CRT-FS mutants confers unique characteristics that promote tumorigenesis. The lack of a KDEL sequence causes mislocalization of CRT-FS, and the change in overall charge influences interactions with glycoprotein substrates. The mutant CTD promotes a glycan-mediated interaction of CRT-FS with the thrombopoietin receptor, causing ligand-independent activation of the JAK-STAT signaling pathway that drives neoplastic transformation (19Araki M.

However, in at least one case, a loss-of-function phenotype is observed for CRT-FS with regard to its lectin chaperone activity. The glycoprotein substrate myeloperoxidase (MPO) requires CRT to fold properly, but, in the presence of CRT-FS, MPO is misfolded, leading to proteasomal degradation and thus a reduction in cellular MPO (18Theocharides A.P.

CRT also mediates Ca2+ release from the ER as its C-terminal acidic tail serves as a low-affinity Ca2+ binding site. CRT-FS deletion mutants (CRT-FSDEL) have fewer acidic residues than CRT-FS insertion mutants (CRT-FSINS). Thus, cells expressing CRT-FSDEL exhibit abnormal cytosolic calcium signaling, which corresponds to a higher risk of myelofibrotic transformation (22Pietra D. Rumi E. Ferretti V.V. Di Buduo C.A.

Two transgenic mouse models have been generated to study this mutation. In one, CRT-FSDEL was ubiquitously expressed in mice, which developed essential thrombocythemia (23Shide K. Kameda T. Yamaji T.

CRT has been shown to affect MHC-I function in mouse embryonic fibroblasts, where ablating CRT expression results in a reduction in endogenous antigen presentation and a decrease in surface MHC-I compared with cells expressing CRT (25Liu C.

Here we demonstrate that ablation of CRT expression in human cells also causes inefficient peptide loading, leading to reduced levels of surface MHC-I and defective antigen presentation. The phenotype is rescued by the expression of CRT-WT, but not the CRT-FS mutants. In cells that co-express both CRT-WT and CRT-FSDEL, a small but significant reduction in surface MHC-I levels was observed. Expression of CRT in HEK293T cells was successfully ablated using the CRISPR/Cas9 approach, as confirmed by RT-PCR and Western blot analysis using a mouse anti-CRT antibody that recognizes both the WT and CRT-FS mutant forms (α-CRT) (Fig. 1, B and C). CRT-WT, CRT-FSDEL, or CRT-FSINS were re-expressed in the CRT-null cell line. RT-PCR analysis of these cells lines showed that CRT-WT and both CRT-FS mRNAs were present at similar levels (Fig. 1B). Western blot analysis indicated that whereas CRT-WT was present at levels similar to that of normal HEK293T cells, no CRT-FSDEL and CRT-FSINS was detected by α-CRT (Fig. 1C, top). However, the mutants could be detected using α-CRT-FS, a mutant-specific CRT rabbit antibody generated against the novel C-terminal peptide, implying that the mutants are present but poorly expressed within the cells (Fig. 1C, middle). We always observe that the level of CRT-FSDEL is lower in the cells than CRT-FSINS. Because CRT-FSDEL and CRT-FSINS lack the ER-retention KDEL sequence present on CRT-WT, a likely explanation is that they are secreted. The culture supernatants of cells expressing CRT-WT or the mutants were therefore examined by Western blotting. Both forms of CRT-FS were readily detected in the culture supernatant, and this was lost when the cells were incubated with brefeldin A (BFA) (Fig. 1D, left). In BFA-treated cells, CRT-FSDEL and CRT-FSINS were detected in the cell lysate (Fig. 1D, right), consistent with inhibition of their secretion by the classical ER-Golgi secretory pathway. We detected a small amount of CRT-WT in the culture supernatant that was not sensitive to BFA treatment (Fig. 1D, left). Lack of signal from the ER-resident chaperone GRP94 in the Western blot analysis of the culture supernatants indicated that there was no contamination by intracellular proteins due to cell death or lysis. We speculate that some CRT-WT is released from the cell via a nonclassical secretory pathway, as has been previously suggested (28Byrne J.C. Ní Gabhann J. Stacey K.B. Coffey B.M. McCarthy E. Thomas W. Jefferies C.A. Bruton's tyrosine kinase is required for apoptotic cell uptake via regulating the phosphorylation and localization of calreticulin.J.

Pulse-chase analysis was carried out to assess the kinetics of CRT-FSDEL and CRT-FSINS secretion. Both were detectable in the supernatant as early as 30 min after chase and half-maximal secretion occurred at 90 min. At 180 min, almost all of the intracellular pool of metabolically labeled CRT had disappeared (Fig. 1E). CRT-FSDEL and CRT-FSINS are largely secreted, lowering their effective concentration in the ER. To determine whether sufficient remained to detect association with the PLC, tapasin was immunoprecipitated from digitonin extracts of the cells followed by Western blotting to detect CRT associated with the PLC. Fig. 1F shows that neither CRT-FS mutant is detectably associated with tapasin. In addition, compared with cells expressing CRT-WT, reduced levels of MHC-I were associated with the PLC in cells expressing the CRT-FS mutants, suggesting that peptide loading in these cells may be affected, which in turn could impact surface MHC-I levels. In cells with neither CRT-WT nor the mutants, no MHC-I was detectably associated with the PLC. Flow cytometric analysis of surface MHC-I was carried out on HEK293T cells lacking CRT expression or expressing CRT-WT or the CRT-FS mutants. In the absence of CRT expression, a 50% decrease in surface MHC-I levels was seen compared with WT HEK293T cells (Fig. 1G). This was rescued by the expression of CRT-WT, but not CRT-FSDEL or CRT-FSINS. Because steady-state levels of the mutants within the cells are low, we wondered whether retaining them in the ER would rescue cell surface MHC-I expression. To test this, we generated cell lines expressing the mutants with an added C-terminal KDEL sequence (CRT-FSDEL+KDEL and CRT-FSINS+KDEL). As seen in Fig. 2A, the ER-retained CRT-FS mutants were detected in the cells. In a complementary experiment, CRT-WT lacking the KDEL sequence (CRT-WT−KDEL) was expressed in the CRT-null cells. CRT-WT−KDEL was poorly detected in cell lysates (Fig. 2B, right) but was readily detected in the supernatant (Fig. 2B, left). Upon BFA treatment, CRT-WT−KDEL was not secreted, and there was a concomitant increase in intracellular accumulation (Fig. 2B). Very few, if any, of the CRT-FS mutants with the added KDEL sequence were detected in the culture supernatants (Fig. 2B, left), and no significant increase in intracellular levels was observed in the presence of BFA (Fig. 2B, right). In the cell lysates, two bands of CRT-FS are sometimes detected by α-CRT, but only the upper band is detected by α-CRT-FS, suggesting that a low level of C-terminal clipping may result in two bands. Retaining the CRT-FS mutants in the ER failed to reverse the reduction in surface MHC-I (Fig. 2C). However, whereas the CRT-FS mutants were ineffective with or without an ER retention signal, CRT-WT−KDEL significantly, albeit partially, restored MHC-I surface expression (Fig. 2C). This suggested that there might be an inherent structural problem in the CRT-FS mutants that disrupts CRT function. To address this, we asked whether CRT-FSDEL+KDEL, CRT-FSINS+KDEL, or CRT-WT−KDEL could be incorporated into the PLC. Tapasin was immunoprecipitated from digitonin extracts of the cells, and co-immunoprecipitated components were analyzed by Western blotting (Fig. 2D). As before, CRT-WT was detected in association with the PLC, but the CRT-FS mutants lacking the KDEL sequence were not. Unexpectedly, the CRT-FS mutants plus the KDEL sequence were incorporated into the PLC, whereas CRT-WT−KDEL could not be detected. This suggests that increasing the local concentration of the CRT-FS mutants in the ER facilitated their interaction with the PLC,"
https://openalex.org/W2804722407,"Rabies is a fatal zoonotic disease that requires fast, accurate diagnosis to prevent disease in an exposed individual. The current gold standard for post-mortem diagnosis of human and animal rabies is the direct fluorescent antibody (DFA) test. While the DFA test has proven sensitive and reliable, it requires high quality antibody conjugates, a skilled technician, a fluorescence microscope and diagnostic specimen of sufficient quality. The LN34 pan-lyssavirus real-time RT-PCR assay represents a strong candidate for rabies post-mortem diagnostics due to its ability to detect RNA across the diverse Lyssavirus genus, its high sensitivity, its potential for use with deteriorated tissues, and its simple, easy to implement design. Here, we present data from a multi-site evaluation of the LN34 assay in 14 laboratories. A total of 2,978 samples (1,049 DFA positive) from Africa, the Americas, Asia, Europe, and the Middle East were tested. The LN34 assay exhibited low variability in repeatability and reproducibility studies and was capable of detecting viral RNA in fresh, frozen, archived, deteriorated and formalin-fixed brain tissue. The LN34 assay displayed high diagnostic specificity (99.68%) and sensitivity (99.90%) when compared to the DFA test, and no DFA positive samples were negative by the LN34 assay. The LN34 assay produced definitive findings for 80 samples that were inconclusive or untestable by DFA; 29 were positive. Five samples were inconclusive by the LN34 assay, and only one sample was inconclusive by both tests. Furthermore, use of the LN34 assay led to the identification of one false negative and 11 false positive DFA results. Together, these results demonstrate the reliability and robustness of the LN34 assay and support a role for the LN34 assay in improving rabies diagnostics and surveillance."
https://openalex.org/W2803418693,"Pollen analysis is widely used to verify the geographic origin of honeys, but has never been employed in Australia. In this study, we analysed the pollen content of 173 unblended honey samples sourced from most of the commercial honey producing regions in southern Australia. Southern Australian vegetation is dominated by Eucalyptus (Myrtaceae) forests and, as expected, most Australian honeys are palynologically dominated by Eucalyptus, while other important components include Myrtaceae taxa such as Corymbia/Angophora and the tribe Leptospermeae; plus Brassicaceae, Echium, Macadamia, and Acacia. An important feature of the honeys is the number of Myrtaceae pollen morphotypes per sample, which is generally high (mean = 4.6) compared to honeys produced outside of Australia, including Eucalyptus honeys produced in the Mediterranean region, and honeys produced in South America, which has its own rich indigenous Myrtaceae flora. In the latter regions, the number of Myrtaceae morphotypes is apparently generally ≤2. A high number of Myrtaceae morphotypes may be a feasible criterion for authenticating the origin of Australian honeys, since most Australian honey is produced by honey bees mainly working indigenous floral resources. Myrtaceae morphotype diversity is a convenient melissopalynological measure that could be applied even where detailed knowledge of the pollen morphology of the many component genera and species is absent. Palynological criteria developed in Europe for authenticating Eucalyptus honeys should not be relied upon for Australian honeys, since those criteria are not based on samples of Australian honey."
https://openalex.org/W2804205737,"Mitochondrial Sirtuin 5 (SIRT5) is an NAD+-dependent demalonylase, desuccinylase, and deglutarylase that controls several metabolic pathways. A number of recent studies point to SIRT5 desuccinylase activity being important in maintaining cardiac function and metabolism under stress. Previously, we described a phenotype of increased mortality in whole-body SIRT5KO mice exposed to chronic pressure overload compared with their littermate WT controls. To determine whether the survival phenotype we reported was due to a cardiac-intrinsic or cardiac-extrinsic effect of SIRT5, we developed a tamoxifen-inducible, heart-specific SIRT5 knockout (SIRT5KO) mouse model. Using our new animal model, we discovered that postnatal cardiac ablation of Sirt5 resulted in persistent accumulation of protein succinylation up to 30 weeks after SIRT5 depletion. Succinyl proteomics revealed that succinylation increased on proteins of oxidative metabolism between 15 and 31 weeks after ablation. Heart-specific SIRT5KO mice were exposed to chronic pressure overload to induce cardiac hypertrophy. We found that, in contrast to whole-body SIRT5KO mice, there was no difference in survival between heart-specific SIRT5KO mice and their littermate controls.

Each of these three studies on the role of SIRT5 in the heart performed succinyl proteomics measurements in WT and SIRT5KO heart tissue to identify enzymes and pathways potentially regulated by SIRT5.

More recently, understanding the tissue-specific effects of mitochondrial sirtuins has emerged as an important area of investigation to determine the contribution of individual tissues to the phenotypes described in germline depletion models. For example, whole-body SIRT3KO mice on a high-fat diet have accelerated development of obesity, insulin resistance, hyperlipidemia, and steatohepatitis (9Hirschey M.D. Shimazu T. Jing E.

However, in a liver- or skeletal muscle–specific SIRT3KO model (two tissues with a strong influence on whole-body metabolism), no metabolic differences compared with WT controls were observed despite hyperacetylation profiles similar to the whole-body SIRT3KO model (10Fernandez-Marcos P.J.

Either a tissue beyond liver/skeletal muscle or a coordinated tissue response was responsible for the phenotypes observed in the whole-body SIRT3KO mouse.

However, it is not yet known whether this is exclusively an effect of SIRT3 in cardiomyocytes; indeed, SIRT3 has also been shown to play a direct role in fibrosis (14Sundaresan N.R. Bindu S.

So far, no studies have been published on the tissue-specific roles of SIRT4 or SIRT5. Thus, there is a need to develop tissue-specific sirtuin KO models to better understand the tissues contributing to the phenotypes revealed in whole-body KO models. To this end, we set out to determine whether the phenotypes described in the whole-body SIRT5KO mouse under chronic pressure overload–induced hypertrophy (6Hershberger K.A. Abraham D.M. Martin A.S.

A well-established experimental tool to knock out genes in an inducible and cardiomyocyte-specific manner is the α-MHC-MerCreMer mouse model. In this model, two mutated estrogen receptors (Mer) flank a Cre transgene located upstream of the cardiomyocyte-specific myosin heavy chain α (α-MHC) promoter (15Sohal D.S. Nghiem M.

This system requires delivery of tamoxifen to bind to the mutated estrogen receptors, translocate to the nucleus, and induce expression of Cre. One benefit of using an inducible system is that the gene can be depleted postnatally, circumventing problems with embryonic lethality or compensation during early development. However, a major caveat of this mouse model is Cre toxicity in the heart, as evidenced by heart failure with high amounts of tamoxifen (16Bersell K. Choudhury S. Mollova M. Polizzotti B.D.

Rep. 2013; 3 (24076663)280610.1038/srep02806Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) mice with αMHC-MerCreMer mice to generate littermates with the following genotypes: SIRT5fl/fl; αMHC-MerCreMer−/− (hereafter referred to as fl/fl) and SIRT5fl/fl; αMHC-MerCreMer+/− (hereafter referred to as fl/fl;MCM). Additionally, the floxed alleles were crossed out of this line to generate a second line of αMHC-MerCreMer−/− and αMHC-MerCreMer+/− mice to generate αMHC-MerCreMer+/− (hereafter referred to as MCM) mice to control for Cre toxicity. Two methods of delivering tamoxifen were tested to determine optimal SIRT5 depletion in the heart. First, adult mice were fed a commercially available tamoxifen citrate diet (Envigo Tekland Diets, TD.130860) for 3 weeks. In a second method, tamoxifen was dissolved in corn oil and given to adult mice by oral gavage at a dose of 80 mg/kg for 3 consecutive days. We found that with either method of delivery, depletion of SIRT5 took more than 2 weeks (Fig. 1). Feeding tamoxifen citrate for 3 weeks followed by 2 weeks of regular chow resulted in ∼75% depletion of SIRT5 (Fig. 1, A and B), whereas 2 weeks after the oral gavage regimen, we observed about 50% depletion of SIRT5 (Fig. 1, D and E). Because expression of Cre in the heart has been shown to be toxic and results in acute cardiomyopathy (17Lexow J. Poggioli T. Sarathchandra P. Santini M.P. Rosenthal N. Cardiac fibrosis in mice expressing an inducible myocardial-specific Cre driver.Dis. Model Mech. 2013; 6 (23929940): 1470-147610.1242/dmm.010470Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), we measured cardiac hypertrophy by calculating the ratio of heart weight to body weight at multiple time points throughout these pilot studies. Although there was only a small sample size at each time point (n = 1 or 2), there were trends of increased hypertrophy in the fl/fl;MCM mice compared with the fl/fl mice after 3 weeks of the tamoxifen diet (Fig. 1C). This hypertrophy appeared to normalize after 2 weeks of regular chow following the tamoxifen diet. No differences in heart weight to body weight were observed between the fl/fl controls and fl/fl;MCM mice in the oral gavage pilot study (Fig. 1F). Finally, we used RT-qPCR to further measure the transcript levels of Sirt5 and markers of Cre toxicity, including Nppa (Anf), Nppb (Bnp), and Il6. Although SIRT5 protein levels were not diminished until weeks after tamoxifen dosing, Sirt5 transcript levels were depleted at earlier time points (Fig. 1G). Maximal depletion of Sirt5 transcript levels occurred after 2 weeks of the tamoxifen diet (Fig. 1G, left) and 1 day after the oral gavage dosing regimen (Fig. 1G, right). The transcript levels of Cre toxicity markers were highest after 3 weeks of tamoxifen diet feeding or 1 day to 1 week after oral gavage dosing (Fig. 1, H–J). In the tamoxifen diet pilot group, transcript levels of Anf, Bnp, and Il6 returned to control levels after 2 weeks of regular chow feeding. Anf and Bnp remained elevated in the oral gavage pilot group 2 weeks after oral gavage dosing (Fig. 1, H and I). Based on these data, we proceeded with optimization of the tamoxifen diet feeding regimen because greater depletion of SIRT5 was achieved, and we predicted that a shorter time on the diet would be sufficient to achieve depletion of SIRT5 and would result in less Cre toxicity. In studies described below, tamoxifen diet was fed for 8–10 days, and we observed decreased evidence of Cre toxicity (data not shown). Given that SIRT5 is a protein lysine desuccinylase and that succinylation in the whole-body SIRT5KO heart is abundant, we looked at succinylation over time after tamoxifen-induced ablation of Sirt5. Adult female mice were fed a tamoxifen citrate diet for 10 days, followed by a regular chow diet. Mice were sacrificed immediately after the tamoxifen diet regimen and 3, 6, 12.5, and 32.5 weeks after the tamoxifen diet regimen. Western blotting was used to analyze succinylation and SIRT5 protein expression in whole-heart lysates. Interestingly, we found that it took several weeks for protein succinylation to accumulate to levels that were comparable with succinylation in the whole-body SIRT5KO mouse (Fig. 2, A and B). Specifically, 32.5 weeks after depletion of Sirt5, succinylation in fl/fl;MCM mouse hearts was about 3-fold greater than succinylation in fl/fl mouse hearts. Although this was the maximum succinylation achieved in this time course, the whole-body SIRT5KO mouse heart has an approximate 5.5-fold increase in succinylation over the WT control (6Hershberger K.A. Abraham D.M. Martin A.S. Mao L. Liu J. Gu H. Locasale J.W. Hirschey M.D. Sirtuin 5 is required for mouse survival in response to cardiac pressure overload.J. Biol. Chem. 2017; 10.1074/jbc.M117.809897Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Thus, it is possible that sites of lysine succinylation would continue to accumulate when the time course is taken past 32.5 weeks. Interestingly, SIRT5 protein appeared to be maximally depleted 3 weeks after the tamoxifen diet feeding regimen (Fig. 2C). Together, these data show that, in our heart-specific, inducible SIRT5KO mouse model, SIRT5 is depleted after 3 weeks on the tamoxifen diet, but succinylation continues to increase for at least 30 weeks. This important finding provides a unique tool to assess the effects of SIRT5 ablation with varying degrees of protein lysine hypersuccinylation, which might allow us to disentangle the effects of SIRT5 from effects of protein succinylation. To further explore the increase in protein lysine succinylation after Sirt5 ablation, we performed succinyl proteomics in fl/fl and fl/fl;MCM mice 15 weeks and 31 weeks after tamoxifen diet feeding. From the previous time course experiment, we predicted that we would observe a small increase in protein succinylation in fl/fl;MCM mice 15 weeks after tamoxifen diet feeding and a large increase in protein succinylation in fl/fl;MCMC mice 31 weeks after tamoxifen diet feeding. Investigation of the cardiac succinylome at these time points would allow us to determine how the cardiac succinylome landscape changes with time after Sirt5 depletion. Immediately after weaning, fl/fl and fl/fl;MCM mice were fed tamoxifen for 8 days and then returned to a regular chow diet. One group of mice was sacrificed 15 weeks after tamoxifen-induced ablation of Sirt5 (n = 2 fl/fl and n = 3 fl/fl;MCM), and a second group of mice was sacrificed 31 weeks after tamoxifen-induced ablation of Sirt5 (n = 2 fl/fl and n = 2 fl/fl;MCM) (Fig. 3A). Left ventricles of hearts were pulverized and processed at the same time for succinyl proteomics analysis using a workflow leveraging peptide labeling with tandem mass tag (TMT) 10-plex reagents (Thermo Fisher Scientific), immunoprecipitation with anti-succinyl lysine antibody (Cell Signaling Technology), and nanoflow LC-MS/MS analysis on a Q Exactive Plus Orbitrap. See Table S1 for quantitative data on relative succinylpeptide and protein abundances. First we analyzed changes in the proteome with respect to time and genotype. Using the parameters of log2 FC ≥ 1 and an adjusted p ≤ 0.1 (Benjamini–Hochberg correction, 10% FDR), there existed only one significant change in the proteome. Esr1 (estrogen receptor) was significantly increased in the 15-week SIRT5KO compared with the 15-week WT control (Fig. 3B). Esr1 induction is due to the constitutive transgenic overexpression of mutated estrogen receptors under the control of the MHC promoter and is thus not an effect of Sirt5 ablation. We interrogated the pathways represented in the top 5% (Fig. 3B, red) and bottom 5% (Fig. 3B, blue) of proteins when ranked according to -fold change and found pathways that were significantly overrepresented in these groups. Among the proteins that increased the most in hearts with Sirt5 ablation, the pathways of muscle contraction and response to stress were increased, whereas, among the proteins that decreased the most in hearts with Sirt5 ablation, pathways of muscle organ development, sensory perception of sound (an irrelevant pathway in heart), muscle contraction, and cellular component of morphogenesis decreased. Given that proteins in muscle contraction both increased and decreased, this is likely because a large number of these proteins were identified in heart tissue. These pathways were also represented in a pathway analysis comparing the log2 FC of SIRT5KO/WT 31 weeks after tamoxifen feeding (data not shown). Importantly, proteins in oxidative metabolism (the main targets of protein lysine succinylation) are not significantly changed with ablation of Sirt5 in the heart. Next we compared the succinylome generated in the heart-specific SIRT5KO and the succinylome we previously generated from the hearts of whole-body SIRT5KO mice (6Hershberger K.A. Abraham D.M. Martin A.S. Mao L. Liu J. Gu H. Locasale J.W. Hirschey M.D. Sirtuin 5 is required for mouse survival in response to cardiac pressure overload.J. Biol. Chem. 2017; 10.1074/jbc.M117.809897Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Given the different proteomic techniques and study designs, we expected to identify a smaller number of sites of succinylation in the heart-specific SIRT5KO succinylome compared with the whole-body SIRT5KO heart succinylome. In the heart-specific SIRT5KO succinylome, we identified (at 1% FDR) and quantified 1,631 succinylated peptides (an additional 504 succinylated peptides were identified but not quantified) that mapped to 462 unique proteins (Fig. 3C). Interestingly, only about half of these succinylated peptides were also identified in the whole-body SIRT5KO heart succinylome. We ranked the identified succinylated peptides in descending order in both succinylome datasets and found that, of the top 50 peptides increased in heart-specific SIRT5KO compared with WT hearts 31 weeks after tamoxifen feeding, half were also in the top 50 peptides increased in the whole-body SIRT5KO heart compared with the WT heart (Fig. 3D, light blue columns). Additionally, the top 50 succinylated peptides in the heart-specific dataset were all identified in the whole-body SIRT5KO heart succinylome. This comparison illustrates that the SIRT5 targets identified in these proteomic datasets had strong overlap and that the two models of SIRT5 deficiency have similar effects on the succinylome of the heart relative to their respective controls. The goal of this study was to determine how the protein succinylation landscape changes over time after SIRT5 depletion, specifically in the heart. To begin to answer this question, we performed pathway analyses on a group of peptides that had increased succinylation, compared both with their respective time control (KO/WT at 15 weeks and KO/WT at 31 weeks; Fig. 4, A and B) and with their genotype control (KO 31 weeks/KO 15 weeks and WT 31 weeks/WT 15 weeks, Fig. 4C). We used parameters of log2 FC ≥ 1 and an adjusted p ≤ 0.1 (Benjamini–Hochberg correction, 10% FDR) to make a list of proteins for each given comparison that had increased succinylation. These lists were uploaded to PANTHER (Protein ANalysis THrough Evolutionary Relationships) to perform statistical overrepresentation tests (19Mi H. Muruganujan A. Casagrande J.T. Thomas P.D. Large-scale gene function analysis with the PANTHER classification system.Nat. Protoc. 2013; 8 (23868073): 1551-156610.1038/nprot.2013.092Crossref PubMed Scopus (1690) Google Scholar) to determine pathways that were particularly susceptible to succinylation in this model. The top three significantly overrepresented pathways in each comparison (except WT 31 weeks/WT 15 weeks, where we saw no change in protein succinylation) were fatty acid β-oxidation, tricarboxylic acid cycle, and oxidative phosphorylation or cellular amino acid catabolic process. Together, these data suggest that proteins in the same metabolic pathways are succinylated in the SIRT5KO heart at 15 weeks and 31 weeks after SIRT5 depletion; indeed, these pathways are significantly overrepresented in this comparison (Fig. 4D). There were no peptides with changes in succinylation when comparing the succinylation profile of WT hearts 15 and 31 weeks after tamoxifen feeding (data not shown), demonstrating that few changes in the sites of protein succinylation occur under basal conditions in this time frame. We hypothesized that the increase in succinylation that occurs in the SIRT5KO heart between 15 and 31 weeks after SIRT5 depletion was due to either an increase in the number of unique sites of succinylation or a further increase in succinylation at lysine residues already succinylated. The succinyl proteomics performed here do not allow us to fully address the former possibility because of the multiplexed nature of our workflow (i.e. qualitative identifications are made on a pool of succinylpeptides from nine samples mixed together for which relative quantitative comparisons are made). To explore the latter possibility, we plotted the -fold change of all sites of lysine succinylation at 31 weeks (KO/WT) and 15 weeks (KO/WT) in fatty acid oxidation (Fig. 4E) and the TCA cycle (Fig. 4F). We found that the -fold change of at least 50% of succinylation sites on proteins in fatty acid oxidation and the TCA cycle increased from 15 weeks (Fig. 4F, light red circles) to 31 weeks (Fig. 4F, dark red circles) after SIRT5 depletion. Only a few SIRT5 succinylation targets have been validated in the heart: lysine 179 and 335 on SDHA (4Boylston J.A. Sun J. Chen Y. Gucek M. Sack M.N. Murphy E.

https://openalex.org/W2803728673,"Adverse Reaction to Metal Debris (ARMD) is a major cause of implant failure leading to revision surgery in patients with metal-on-metal (MoM) hip arthroplasties. However, the pathogenesis and its association to implant wear are poorly understood and previous studies have yielded discrepant results. We sought to investigate the associations between histological findings, whole blood and synovial fluid metal ion concentrations and periprosthetic tissue metal concentrations in patients with MoM total hip replacements and hip resurfacings revised for ARMD. 107 hips in total were included in our study. Of these, 87 were total hip replacements and 20 were hip resurfacings, respectively. We found that whole blood, synovial fluid and periprosthetic tissue metal concentrations correlated poorly with histological findings. We suggest that the lack of a clear association between histological findings and wear measures in the present study as well as in previous studies is mostly influenced by variability in patient susceptibility. However, patients presenting with perivascular lymphocytic infiltration had lower chromium concentration in their periprosthetic tissues than patients with no perivascular lymphocytic infiltration. This may reflect the role of metal hypersensitivity in implant failure in these patients. Patients with total hip replacements evinced more necrosis and lymphocytic infiltration in their tissues than patients with hip resurfacings. This suggests that trunnion wear debris is more cytotoxic and/or immunogenic than bearing wear debris leading to higher failure rates seen in patients with total hip replacements."

Here we showed that mitochondrial fission was strongly induced in pancreatic beta cellsmainly due to an elevation of DRP1S616 phosphorylation through HIF-1αactivation and subsequent DRP1 mitochondrial translocation. Hypoxia-induced pancreatic beta cell death can be reversed by the inhibition of mitochondrial fission viaDRP1 knockdown. We further demonstrated that hypoxia-induced mitochondrial fission untightened the cristae formation, which subsequently triggers mitochondrial cytochrome c release and consequent caspase activation. Moreover, treatment with mitochondrial division inhibitor-1 (Mdivi-1), a specific inhibitor of DRP1-mediated mitochondrial fission, significantly suppressedbeta cell death in vitro, indicating a promising therapeutic strategy for treatment of diabetes.Taken together, our results reveal a crucial role for the DRP1-mediated mitochondrial fission in hypoxia-induced beta cell death, which provides a strong evidence for thisprocess as drug target indiabetestreatment."
https://openalex.org/W2804017959,"The lungs are highly susceptible to injury, including ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury. Pulmonary I/R injury can occur when correcting conditions such as primary pulmonary hypertension, and is also relatively common after lung transplantation or other cardiothoracic surgery. Methods to reduce pulmonary I/R injury are urgently needed to improve outcomes following procedures such as lung transplantation. Remote liver ischemic preconditioning (RLIPC) is an effective cardioprotective measure, reducing damage caused by subsequent cardiac I/R injury, but little is known about its potential role in pulmonary protection. Here, we analyzed the efficacy and mechanistic basis of RLIPC in a rat model of pulmonary I/R injury. RLIPC reduced lung I/R injury, lessening structural damage, inflammatory cytokine production and apoptosis. In addition, RLIPC preserved pulmonary function compared to controls following lung I/R injury. RLIPC stimulated phosphorylation of pulmonary STAT3, a component of the SAFE signaling pathway, but not phosphorylation of RISK pathway signaling proteins. Accordingly, STAT3 inhibition using AG490 eliminated the pulmonary protection afforded by RLIPC. Our data demonstrate for the first time that RLIPC protects against pulmonary I/R injury, via a signaling pathway requiring STAT3 phosphorylation."
https://openalex.org/W2803196939,"This study evaluates the potential for improving patient safety by introducing a metacognitive attention aid that enables clinicians to more easily access and use existing alarm/alert information. It is hypothesized that this introduction will enable clinicians to easily triage alarm/alert events and quickly recognize emergent opportunities to adapt care delivery. The resulting faster response to clinically important alarms/alerts has the potential to prevent adverse events and reduce healthcare costs.A randomized within-subjects single-factor clinical experiment was conducted in a high-fidelity 20-bed simulated acute care hospital unit. Sixteen registered nurses, four at a time, cared for five simulated patients each. A two-part highly realistic clinical scenario was used that included representative: tasking; information; and alarms/alerts. The treatment condition introduced an integrated wearable attention aid that leveraged metacognition methods from proven military systems. The primary metric was time for nurses to respond to important alarms/alerts.Use of the wearable attention aid resulted in a median relative within-subject improvement for individual nurses of 118% (W = 183, p = 0.006). The top quarter of relative improvement was 3,303% faster (mean; 17.76 minutes reduced to 1.33). For all unit sessions, there was an overall 148% median faster response time to important alarms (8.12 minutes reduced to 3.27; U = 2.401, p = 0.016), with 153% median improvement in consistency across nurses (F = 11.670, p = 0.001).Existing device-centric alarm/alert notification solutions can require too much time and effort for nurses to access and understand. As a result, nurses may ignore alarms/alerts as they focus on other important work. There has been extensive research on reducing alarm frequency in healthcare. However, alarm safety remains a top problem. Empirical observations reported here highlight the potential of improving patient safety by supporting the meta-work of checking alarms."
https://openalex.org/W2803578830,"The objective of this study was to explore trajectories of lung function decline with age in the general population, and to study the effect of sociodemographic and life style related risk factors, in particular smoking and BMI. For this purpose, we used data from the Doetinchem Cohort Study (DCS) of men and women, selected randomly from the general population and aged 20–59 years at inclusion in 1987–1991, and followed until the present. Participants in the DCS are assessed every five years. Spirometry has been performed as part of this assessment from 1994 onwards. Participants were included in this study if spirometric measurement of FEV1, which in this study was the main parameter of interest, was acceptable and reproducible on at least one measurement round, leading to the inclusion of 5727 individuals (3008 females). Statistical analysis revealed three typical trajectories. The majority of participants followed a trajectory that closely adhered to the Global Lung Initiative Reference values (94.9% of men and 96.4% of women). Two other trajectories showed a more pronounced decline. Smoking and the presence of respiratory complaints were the best predictors of a trajectory with stronger decline. A greater BMI over the follow-up period was associated with a more unfavorable FEV1 course both in men (β = -0.027 (SD = 0.002); P < 0.001) and in women (β = -0.008 (SD = 0.001); P < 0.001). Smokers at baseline who quit the habit during follow-up, showed smaller decline in FEV1 in comparison to persistent smokers, independent of BMI change (In men β = -0.074 (SD = 0.020); P < 0.001. In women β = -0.277 (SD = 0.068); P < 0.001). In conclusion, three typical trajectories of age-related FEV1 decline could be distinguished. Change in the lifestyle related risk factors, BMI and smoking, significantly impact aging-related decline of lung function. Identifying deviant trajectories may help in early recognition of those at risk of a diagnosis of lung disease later in life."

On average, influenza infects 5–10% of the human population annually (1World Health Organization Influenza (seasonal); fact sheet No. 211. World Health Organization, Geneva, Switzerland2016Google Scholar). Pigs are known to be highly susceptible to infection by both avian and human IAVs, and co-infection can generate novel pandemic viruses as illustrated by the most recent pandemic of 2009 (2Neumann G. Noda T. Kawaoka Y.

Understanding the molecular mechanisms that underlie the role of swine as important intermediary hosts has become an increasingly relevant question in influenza virus research. Infection, maintenance, and adaptation of IAVs in host organisms are mainly determined by the (early) innate immune response that is considered fundamental for early containment of infection. Several soluble innate immune inhibitors contribute to immediate protection against respiratory infections (4Tripathi S. White M.R. Hartshorn K.L. The amazing innate immune response to influenza A virus infection.Innate Immun. 2015; 21 (24217220): 73-9810.1177/1753425913508992Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar).

This collagenous C-type lectin is constitutively expressed in the airways where it can interact directly with inhaled IAVs, resulting in viral aggregation and blocking of IAV attachment to epithelial cells, thereby protecting against IAV infection. In addition, SP-D acts as an opsonin and modulates the phagocytic activity of alveolar macrophages and neutrophils that contributes to more efficient clearance of IAV particles (7Hartshorn K.L.

These domains facilitate multivalent, high-affinity interactions with patterns of high-mannose asparagine-linked glycans present on the hemagglutinin (HA) of IAV (9Hartshorn K. Chang D. Rust K. White M. Heuser J. Crouch E. Interactions of recombinant human pulmonary surfactant protein D and SP-D multimers with influenza A.Am. J.

HA is the spike protein responsible for viral attachment through its sialic acid (SA) receptor–binding site to SA-rich glycoproteins on host cells, and therefore is an important virulence factor of IAV. In contrast to Ca2+-dependent viral glycan–targeting β-inhibitors like SP-D, another class of so-called “γ-inhibitors” acts in a Ca2+-independent manner via presentation of SA ligands to the HA receptor–binding site. This interaction interferes with the receptor-mediated attachment of the virus to SA moieties expressed on the surface of host epithelial cells. These so-called γ-inhibitors include the sialylated collectins surfactant protein A (SP-A) and lung glycoprotein-340. These collectins, in contrast to SP-D, are capable of neutralizing poorly glycosylated IAVs like A/Puerto Rico/8/34(H1N1) (PR-8) and pandemic IAVs, strains that typically lack N-linked glycans on the HA head (11Hartshorn K.L.

Interestingly, previous studies showed that full-length porcine SP-D (pSP-D) expresses substantially stronger anti-IAV activity as compared with SP-Ds from other animal species, including human SP-D (hSP-D) (12van Eijk M. White M.R. Crouch E.C. Batenburg J.J. Vaandrager A.B. Van Golde L.M. Haagsman H.P. Hartshorn K.L.

First, similar to SP-A, pSP-D has a highly sialylated N-linked glycan on its CRD at Asn-303 (Fig. 1) that generates a dual mechanism of interaction with IAV, turning pSP-D into a γ-inhibitor as well as a β-inhibitor against IAV (14van Eijk M. White M.R. Batenburg J.J. Vaandrager A.B. van Golde L.M. Haagsman H.P. Hartshorn K.L. Interactions of influenza A virus with sialic acids present on porcine surfactant protein D.Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 2004; 30 (14672916): 871-87910.1165/rcmb.2003-0355OCCrossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Second, sequence alignment of the CRDs of all characterized SP-Ds revealed the presence of three extra amino acids near the carbohydrate-binding site of the CRD in pSP-D, located between residues Gly-326 and Gly-327 of the hSP-D sequence (Gly-326A–Ser-326B–Ser-326C or “GSS-loop”; Fig. 1) (15van Eijk M. Haagsman H.P. Skinner T. Archibald A. Reid K.B. Lawson P.R. Porcine lung surfactant protein D: complementary DNA cloning, chromosomal localization, and tissue distribution.J.

X-ray crystallographic analysis, docking studies with octamannose, and molecular dynamics simulations were performed with a recombinant trimeric fragment containing only the neck and CRD domain (NCRD) of pSP-D (RpNCRD), lacking the N-linked glycan (RpNCRD–dNG). These studies provided insight into the three-dimensional structure of the CRD from pSP-D complexed with or without d-mannose (16van Eijk M. Rynkiewicz M.J. White M.R. Hartshorn K.L. Zou X.

The combined data suggested that the 3-amino acid insertion alters the lectin site conformation, shaping a flexible extended loop that potentially facilitates recognition of distal portions of highly-branched mannose-rich oligosaccharides like those expressed on the IAV surface. Previous in vitro studies with IAV indeed showed that pSP-D displays profound inhibitory activity against IAV due to both distinct structural features outlined above (16van Eijk M. Rynkiewicz M.J. White M.R. Hartshorn K.L. Zou X. Schulten K. Luo D. Crouch E.C. Cafarella T.R. Head J.F. Haagsman H.P.

As the next challenge, we aimed to investigate the native, N-glycosylated neck-CRD fragment of pSP-D (RpNCRD) to dissect the dual mechanism of interaction between pSP-D and IAV in more detail. Given the susceptibility of pigs for IAV co-infection and reassortment that can cause pandemics in humans, we also investigated the antiviral potential of RpNCRD against pandemic IAV. These experiments were also performed to assess the potential of RpNCRD-based novel antivirals to reduce disease severity in humans during future pandemic outbreaks of IAV. To this end, we used the HEK293 expression system to generate a fully functional mammalian N-glycosylated RpNCRD, studied its molecular structure by X-ray crystallography, and compared it with that of RpNCRD–dNG and RhNCRD. IAV neutralization studies revealed that RpNCRD, in contrast to RhNCRD, exhibited potent neutralizing activity against pandemic IAV (A/Aichi/68(H3N2); Aichi68), mediated by the CRD as well as the N-linked glycan present on RpNCRD. Given the contribution of the N-linked glycan on RpNCRD to its viral neutralization activity, we also characterized the location, site-occupancy, and composition of the N-glycan in RpNCRD. Furthermore, glycan-binding array studies were performed to characterize the CRD-binding characteristics of recombinant full-length pSP-D (RpSP-D) and the human analogue RhSP-D. The binding studies were also carried out with RpSP-D–dNG to study the impact of N-glycosylation of the CRD on the carbohydrate-binding properties of RpSP-D. The structure of RpNCRD is very similar to that previously determined for the nonglycosylated pig SP-D, RpNCRD–dNG (16van Eijk M. Rynkiewicz M.J. White M.R. Hartshorn K.L. Zou X. Schulten K. Luo D. Crouch E.C. Cafarella T.R. Head J.F. Haagsman H.P. Seaton B.A. A unique sugar-binding site mediates the distinct anti-influenza A activity of pig surfactant protein D.J. Biol.

Superimposition of RpNCRD and RpNCRD–dNG results in a root-mean-square-deviation (r.m.s.d.) of 0.25 and 0.24 Å, respectively, calculated using 155 and 154 α-carbons. No major rearrangements in the trimeric structure are noted, which is evident from the similarity of the unit cell dimensions of the crystals. Therefore, the impact of N-glycosylation on the global structure of RpNCRD is minimal. The initial crystals were grown in the presence of glycerol, which can act as a ligand for SP-D at the high concentrations used in the growth solutions. Therefore, an attempt was made to remove the glycerol by soaking crystals in solutions lacking glycerol before data collection (Table 1), with the expectation of observing an unliganded lectin site. Surprisingly, the resulting maps show clear electron density for the first seven sugars of a biantennary complex–type glycan (Fig. 3B) from a neighboring molecule in the crystal (Fig. 3A). On each antenna, there is density present for a single mannose (MAN503A and MAN503B) and one GlcNAc (NAG504A and NAG504B). There is neither density for galactose or SAs nor other antennae, which could be present in the structure but disordered. The glycan makes several interactions with the CRD through the sugars of the antennae (Fig. 3C). MAN503A is bound in a similar way as the mannose in the previously published complex of RpNCRD–dNG (16van Eijk M. Rynkiewicz M.J. White M.R. Hartshorn K.L. Zou X. Schulten K. Luo D. Crouch E.C.

MAN503A also forms, through its O6 atom. There are additional interactions between the CRD and the glycan in the structure. NAG504A, the next sugar in the chain after MAN503A, forms a hydrogen bond to the side chain of Asn-325 through its N-acetyl carbonyl group. NAG504B, the terminal sugar on the other antenna, forms a hydrogen bond to the side chain amino group of Lys-343 through its O6 atom. Finally, MAN503B makes several interactions with the CRD, where the O3 and O4 atoms make three hydrogen bonds with the side chains of Glu-333 and Arg-349.Table 1Data collection and refinement statistics of RpNCRD crystal structureParameterValueGlycerol complexGlycerol soaked outData collectionSpace groupP63P63Unit cell dimensionsa = b = 66.798 Åa = b = 66.015 Åc = 64.974 Åc = 64.658 ÅResolution15–1.9 Å (1.97–1.90 Å)15–1.9 Å (1.97–1.90 Å)No. of reflections12,30412,220Data cutoffI ≤ −3σI ≤ −3σI/σ(I)23.6 (3.2)25.1 (4.5)Completeness94.0% (67.4%)96.0% (82.2%)Redundancy4.7 (2.8)6.5 (4.5)Rmerge0.058 (0.356)0.063 (0.376)RefinementRwork0.2010.223Rfree0.2470.250No. of protein atoms12161213No. of waters9386No. of other atoms72107Average B factorsProtein46.345.6Waters48.150.0Sugars/glycerol/calcium63.166.5r.m.s.d. from ideal valuesBond lengths (Å)0.0140.013Bond angles (°)1.0850.805Chiral volume (Å3)0.0690.051Ramachandran plotFavored98.71%98.06%Allowed1.29%1.94%Outliers0.00%0.00% Open table in a new tab Figure 3Electron density of the RpNCRD structure.

These sugars are not seen in the resulting electron density maps and are most likely disordered. However, the other antenna is observed in the back-soaked structure where it makes similar interactions with residues Lys-343, Gln-333, and Arg-349. The conservation of these interactions suggests that these residues may bind these same sugars in complexes of SP-D with biological substrates. To determine the contribution of the N-linked glycan present in the CRD of pSP-D to interactions with pandemic IAV, we first determined differences in viral aggregation of Aichi68 by RpNCRD as compared with RpNCRD–dNG (Fig. 4A). Although incubation of virus in buffer alone did not result in any aggregate formation, RpNCRD was able to aggregate Aichi68, and loss of the N-glycan resulted in a significant drop in viral aggregation (RpNCRD–dNG). These differences in binding and aggregation of Aichi68 were underlined by assessing the HA potency of the obtained aggregates by adding erythrocytes to aliquots of these mixtures (Fig. 4B). Absence of aggregation results in free viral particles that agglutinate RBCs, resulting in high viral HA titers by such samples (control, highest hemagglutination). In contrast, samples obtained after viral aggregation in the presence of increasing amounts of RpNCRDs (2.0–4.0–8.0 μg/ml) showed a dose-dependent decrease in HA for both preparations. Importantly, the RpNCRD samples from the aggregation assay were significantly less potent in blunting HA activity as compared with RpNCRD–dNG, indicating that the N-glycan contributed to a more potent interaction between the NCRD of pSP-D and Aichi68. RhNCRD, in contrast to RpNCRD or RpNCRD–dNG, is not able to aggregate Aichi68, in agreement with what had been previously published (17Nikolaidis N.M. White M.R. Allen K. Tripathi S. Qi L. McDonald B. Taubenberger J. Seaton B.A. McCormack F.X. Crouch E.C. Hartshorn K.L. Mutations flanking the carbohydrate binding site of surfactant protein D confer antiviral activity for pandemic influenza A viruses.Am. J. Physiol. Lung Cell. Mol.

More evidence for involvement of the N-glycan in RpNCRD in binding pandemic IAV and for the differences in antiviral activity between RhNCRD and RpNCRD–dNG (both lacking the N-glycan thus revealing differences in species-specific lectin–mediated interactions only) was obtained by HAI and neutralization of infectivity (Fig. 5, A and B, respectively). The HAI assay showed that whereas RhNCRD was very weak in inhibiting Aichi68, RpNCRD was significantly stronger in HAI activity as compared with both other preparations (RpNCRD > RpNCRD–dNG > RhNCRD). The same order of neutralizing potency was illustrated by neutralization of Aichi68 infectivity of MDCK cells. A dose-dependent decrease in infectivity was demonstrated for all three preparations, whereas virus neutralization by RpNCRD was significantly stronger compared with RhNCRD (at all concentrations tested) and with RpNCRD–dNG (10 μg/ml). The presence of an N-linked glycan at Asn-303 of RpNCRD was determined by analysis of glycopeptide tandem mass spectra (Fig. 6). Isolated precursor ion 1063.1666(4+) could be matched to the intact glycopeptide mass of SMTDIKTEGNF–Hex6HexNAc5dHex1NeuAc3. Upon collisional dissociation, the precursor generated low mass oxonium ions corresponding to protonated mono-, di-, and trisaccharide ions. These ions confirmed the presence of glycosylation on the selected precursor ion. Precursor identity was confirmed by peptide backbone ions, naked intact peptide ion, and peptide + saccharide ions (so-called stub glycopeptide ions), as described previously (18Khatri K. Staples G.O. Leymarie N. Leon D.R. Turiák L. Huang Y. Yip S. Hu H. Heckendorf C.F. Zaia J. Confident assignment of site-specific glycosylation in complex glycoproteins in a single step.J. Proteome Res. 2014; 13 (25153361): 4347-435510.1021/pr500506zCrossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). For site-occupancy analysis, peak areas for extracted ion chromatograms of labeled and unlabeled peptides, identified using database searches, were integrated and compared with calculate the site occupancy (Table 2). One of the considerations with identification of the site of N-glycosylation was that some of the asparagine residues may spontaneously undergo deamidation to form aspartic acid or iso-aspartic acid. If present, this reaction reduces the mass difference between the unglycosylated and the deglycosylated peptides (18O) to 2 Da instead of 3 Da. The rate of deamidation increases with pH and is highest for sequence motifs of “NG.” Considering the possibility for deamidation, chromatograms were extracted for masses corresponding to both deamidated and nondeamidated forms of the peptides (unlabeled) containing the sequon. It was noticed that most of the unlabeled/unglycosylated sequon-containing peptides had undergone deamidation. To confirm this, a deamidation control was analyzed using LC-MS under the same conditions, except the mass spectra were acquired in the linear ion trap. This control sample was a chymotryptic digest of RpNCRD, without any N-glycan release by PNGase F treatment. The sample showed that almost all of the unglycosylated sequon-containing peptides were present in the deamidated form (results not shown). The abundances of such unglycosylated sequon-containing peptides were low compared with the glycosylated forms. Quantification of the extracted ion chromatograms was performed for the identified labeled and unlabeled peptides with two and three miscleavages, respectively, with peptide sequences “SMTDIKTEGNFTYPTGEPL” and “LSMTDIKTEGNFTYPTGEPL” (Table 2). The site occupancy values were corrected for the effective H218O concentration in the PNGase F reaction. Effective H218O was only 85% due to the presence of buffer and enzyme in the reaction. The average site occupancy was determined as 98.75 ± 0.55% from these data. Representative MALDI-TOF mass spectra showing incorporation of either 16O or 18O at the site of glycosylation upon PNGase F treatment, are provided as supporting information for N-deglycosylated RpNCRD (Fig. S1A) and for both derived peptide fragments indicated above (Fig. S1, B and C).Table 2Summary of RpNCRD N-glycosylation site-occupancy analysisTechnical replicate18O-Labeled peptide SMTDIKTEGNFTYPTGEPL (precursor 1052)18O-Labeled peptide LSMTDIKTEGNFTYPTGEPL (precursor 1109)Average site occupancyaRatio of labeled/glycosylated peptide is shown.Average site occupancybRatio of labeled/glycosylated peptide, corrected for effective H218O in the reaction, is shown.S.D.%%%%%183.4484.1083.9498.750.55283.4584.30383.2884.77483.6884.49a Ratio of labeled/glycosylated peptide is shown.b Ratio of labeled/glycosylated peptide, corrected for effective H218O in the reaction, is shown.

The resulting glycan compositions and relative abundances are depicted in Fig. 7A. Only those glycans are shown that had a relative abundance greater than 1% of total abundance from all identified glycans. Interpretation of the data points toward a heterogeneous distribution of typical mammalian complex N-glycans consisting of bi-, tri-, and tetra-antennary structures that are largely fucosylated with variable sialylation with N-acetylneuraminic acid (NeuAc) residues.

https://openalex.org/W2804597704,"Class I benzoyl-CoA (BzCoA) reductases (BCRs) are key enzymes in the anaerobic degradation of aromatic compounds. They catalyze the ATP-dependent reduction of the central BzCoA intermediate and analogues of it to conjugated cyclic 1,5-dienoyl-CoAs probably by a radical-based, Birch-like reduction mechanism. Discovered in 1995, the enzyme from the denitrifying bacterium Thauera aromatica (BCRTar) has so far remained the only isolated and biochemically accessible BCR, mainly because BCRs are extremely labile, and their heterologous production has largely failed so far. Here, we describe a platform for the heterologous expression of the four structural genes encoding a designated 3-methylbenzoyl-CoA reductase from the related denitrifying species Thauera chlorobenzoica (MBRTcl) in Escherichia coli. This reductase represents the prototype of a distinct subclass of ATP-dependent BCRs that were proposed to be involved in the degradation of methyl-substituted BzCoA analogues. The recombinant MBRTcl had an αβγδ-subunit architecture, contained three low-potential [4Fe-4S] clusters, and was highly oxygen-labile. It catalyzed the ATP-dependent reductive dearomatization of BzCoA with 2.3–2.8 ATPs hydrolyzed per two electrons transferred and preferentially dearomatized methyl- and chloro-substituted analogues in meta- and para-positions. NMR analyses revealed that 3-methylbenzoyl-CoA is regioselectively reduced to 3-methyl-1,5-dienoyl-CoA. The unprecedented reductive dechlorination of 4-chloro-BzCoA to BzCoA probably via HCl elimination from a reduced intermediate allowed for the previously unreported growth of T. chlorobenzoica on 4-chlorobenzoate. The heterologous expression platform established in this work enables the production, isolation, and characterization of bacterial and archaeal BCR and BCR-like radical enzymes, for many of which the function has remained unknown."

Growing evidence reveals the cross-talk between the splicing and RNA editing, but there is a paucity of substantial evidence for its mechanistic details and contribution in a physiological context. Here, our findings demonstrate that tumor-associated differential RNA editing, in conjunction with splicing machinery, regulates the expression of variants of HNRPLL, a gene encoding splicing factor. We discovered an HNRPLL transcript variant containing an additional exon 12A (E12A), which is a substrate of ADAR1 and ADAR2. Adenosine deaminases acting on RNA (ADAR) direct deaminase-dependent expression of the E12A transcript, and ADAR-mediated regulation of E12A is largely splicing-based, and does not affect the stability or nucleocytoplasmic distribution of the transcript. Furthermore, ADAR-mediated modification of exon 12A generates an enhancer for the oncogenic splicing factor SRSF1 and consequently promotes the frequency of alternative splicing. Gene expression profiling by RNA-seq revealed that E12A acts distinctly from HNRPLL and regulates a set of growth-related genes, such as cyclin CCND1 and growth factor receptor TGFBR1. Accordingly, silencing E12A expression leads to impaired clonogenic ability and enhanced sensitivity to doxorubicin, thus highlighting the significance of this alternative isoform in tumor cell survival. In summary, we present the interplay of RNA editing and splicing as a regulatory mechanism of gene expression and also its physiological relevance.

Thus, mRNA processing of pre-mRNA is a gene regulatory mechanism that confers genome dynamics and diversity. Examples of mRNA processing include capping, polyadenylation, adenosine to inosine (A-to-I) RNA editing, and splicing; the latter two occur during transcription and are organized in a spatiotemporal manner (1Bentley D.L.

A-to-I RNA editing is mediated by adenosine deaminases acting on RNA (ADARs), which recognize repetitive elements in transcripts forming double-stranded structures, and catalyze the hydrolytic deamination of adenosine residues. ADAR proteins are highly conserved across species (6Slavov D. Crnogorac-Jurcević T. Clark M. Gardiner K. Comparative analysis of the DRADA A-to-I RNA editing gene from mammals, pufferfish and zebrafish.Gene. 2000; 250 (10854778): 53-6010.1016/S0378-1119(00)00175-XCrossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), and expression of all three family members: ADAR1, ADAR2, and ADAR3, is found in vertebrates. ADAR1 and ADAR2 are expressed in most tissues, and the ubiquitously expressed ADAR1 has two isoforms: a nuclear constitutive protein (ADAR1–p110) and a cytoplasmic interferon-inducible protein (ADAR1–p150). ADAR3 expression is restricted to brain tissues, and it appears to be enzymatically inactive (7Chen C.X. Cho D.S. Wang Q. Lai F. Carter K.C. Nishikura K. A third member of the RNA-specific adenosine deaminase gene family, ADAR3, contains both single- and double-stranded RNA binding domains.Rna. 2000; 6 (10836796): 755-76710.1017/S1355838200000170Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar). Resulting inosine by ADARs acts as guanosine in genetic translation machinery and forms bp with cytidine; thus, A-to-I editing is functionally equivalent to A-to-G editing. A-to-I modification is known to alter transcript characteristics such as structural stability, nucleocytoplasmic distribution, and protein coding (8Wang I.X. So E. Devlin J.L. Zhao Y. Wu M.

The oncogenic and tumor-suppressive roles of ADARs have been reported and are dependent upon cell type. In this regard, ADAR-mediated regulation relies on the nonsynonymous substitution of oncogenic proteins and modulation of the microRNA interference pathway. For example, via changes in their protein codes and properties, enhanced ADAR-mediated RNA editing of AZIN1 and RHOQ confer augmented invasiveness and aggressiveness to liver and colorectal cancer cells, respectively (11Chen L.

In contrast, the ADAR-edited form of GABRA3 down-regulates AKT activation and suppresses breast cancer metastasis (13Gumireddy K. Li A. Kossenkov A.V. Sakurai M. Yan J. Li Y. Xu H. Wang J. Zhang P.J.

Commun. 2016; 7 (26869349)1071510.1038/ncomms10715Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). In parallel with protein recoding, ADARs could also modulate the substrate recognition of microRNA and RNAi machinery (14Ota H. Sakurai M. Gupta R. Valente L. Wulff B.E. Ariyoshi K. Iizasa H. Davuluri R.V. Nishikura K. ADAR1 forms a complex with Dicer to promote microRNA processing and RNA-induced gene silencing.Cell. 2013; 153 (23622242): 575-58910.1016/j.cell.2013.03.024Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). ADAR-edited miR-376a and unedited miR-376a individually function as tumor-suppressive and oncogenic molecules, respectively, and attenuated editing promotes the expression of unedited miR-376a and the metastasis of glioblastomas (15Choudhury Y.

However, there is a paucity of concrete evidence for the elucidation of the interplay between RNA editing and splicing and its relevance in a physiological context. Splicing removes introns from pre-mRNA and ligates adjacent exons to form continuous mRNA. Splicing of the same pre-mRNA transcript to produce different exon arrangements is termed alternative splicing, and this process generates transcript diversity. Core splicing operators are composed of small nuclear ribonucleoprotein molecules, which cooperate with auxiliary components to recognize splice sites and catalyze intron excision via transesterification reactions. The nature of spliceosome assembly is dynamic and complex, and the composition of and interaction within the assembly architecture determines the splicing outcome (16Chen M. Manley J.L. Mechanisms of alternative splicing regulation: insights from molecular and genomics approaches.Nat. Rev. Mol.

Cancer-associated mutations and dysregulated splicing factors can drive oncogenic splicing patterns that produce loss-of-function proteins and increase susceptibility to disease and malignancy (18Xu Q. Lee C. Discovery of novel splice forms and functional analysis of cancer-specific alternative splicing in human expressed sequences.Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31 (14500827): 5635-564310.1093/nar/gkg786Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Aberrant splicing can also promote tumor progression by producing noncanonical transcripts implicated in anti-apoptotic signaling, angiogenesis, and drug resistance (19Salton M. Kasprzak W.K. Voss T. Shapiro B.A. Poulikakos P.I. Misteli T. Inhibition of vemurafenib-resistant melanoma by interference with pre-mRNA splicing.Nat. Commun. 2015; 6 (25971842)710310.1038/ncomms8103Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The current study provides substantial evidence of the interplay between RNA editing and splicing, with an implication in cancer biology. We uncovered in different tumor types the splicing factor gene HNRPLL as a differentially edited target, which was further identified as a substrate of both ADAR1 and ADAR2. ADARs-mediated RNA editing of the HNRPLL pre-mRNA determined its splicing pattern, an inclusion of a novel exon 12A, and consequently the generation of a transcript variant we named HNRPLL–E12A (E12A). E12A up-regulation is coordinated with alternative splicing; RNA editing created an additional exonic enhancer for the oncogenic splicing factor SRSF1, which promotes exon 12A inclusion and E12A transcript abundance in an ADAR-dependent manner. Although no functional protein product was detected for the E12A transcript, this variant was found by RNA-seq-based transcriptome profiling to regulate the expression of several genes, revealing a cellular role distinct from HNRPLL and a functional link to proliferation. Further in line with this role in cell growth and survival, knockdown of E12A expression altered the expression of several cell growth regulators, impaired colony formation of tumor cells, and enhanced their apoptotic state. Taken together, these findings demonstrate that tumor-associated A-to-I modification of the E12A transcript, which occurs via altered splicing preferences, has a fundamental role in tumorigenesis. This study also sheds light on the functional relevance of the coordinated action of two co-transcriptional processes, RNA editing and alternative splicing. To provide further insights into the physiological relevance of RNA editing in tumor malignancy, we first sought to identify from a systems perspective A-to-I(G) events with differential incidence in tumors. Toward this end, we used public RNA-seq data on kidney and bladder tumors to obtain corresponding RNA editome profiles (20Gui Y. Guo G. Huang Y. Hu X. Tang A. Gao S. Wu R. Chen C. Li X. Zhou L. He M. Li Z. Sun X. Jia W. Chen J. et al.Frequent mutations of chromatin remodeling genes in transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder.Nat.

Genet. 2011; 44 (22138691): 17-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). We subsequently discovered three editing events in close proximity on the HNRPLL transcript, with a distinct difference in the degree of editing between normal and tumor specimens (Fig. 1, A and B). Sequence alignment mapped this cluster of editing sites to intron 12 of the HNRPLL gene. Intriguingly, according to the EST sequences archived in the UCSC genome browser, these editing positions could be expressed in the exonic region of a particular HNRPLL transcript variant (Fig. S1A). Because this alternative exon is 3′ to the annotated exon 12, we hereafter termed this exon 12A and the transcript variant as HNRPLL–E12A (or E12A). The expression of the E12A transcript was confirmed by variant-specific amplification in both normal and cancer cell lines (Fig. 1C), whereas its RNA editing at the three nucleotide locations (annotated from 5′ to 3′ as A, B, and C) in various cancer cells was verified by Sanger sequencing (Fig. 1C, Fig. S1B). Several lines of evidence provided additional support to the notion that the E12A transcript is a substrate of ADARs-mediated RNA editing: 1) HNRPLL pre-mRNA was predicted by the RNAfold web server (http://rna.tbi.univie.ac.at/cgi-bin/RNAWebSuite/RNAfold.cgi) 4Please note that the JBC is not responsible for the long-term archiving and maintenance of this site or any other third party hosted site. to form double-stranded structures via complementarity between two inverted Alu repetitive elements bordering on the 12A exon, which presumably favors ADAR catalysis (Fig. S1C). 2) RNAi-mediated repression of ADAR1 was found to reduce A-to-G transition at the first two sites (A and B) (Fig. 1D, Fig. S1, D and E), whereas ADAR2 repression decreased editing degrees of all three sites, with site C exhibiting the most notable change (Fig. 1E). These results further illustrated that E12A indeed undergoes ADARs-dependent RNA editing. 3) Next, RNA immunoprecipitation (RNA-IP) assays were conducted to document the physical interaction between ADARs and the E12A transcript. Anti-ADAR1 RNA-IP revealed specific and abundant levels of E12A RNA in the precipitates relative to the control IgG (Fig. 1F, Fig. S1F). RNA-IP with ectopic ADAR2 expression also showed similar results, illustrating the binding of ADAR2 to the pre-mRNA, but not the mature transcript, of HNRPLL (Fig. 1G, Fig. S1G). Our RNA-IP assays therefore substantiated the possibility that ADARs bind and enzymatically modify the E12A RNA. 4) Finally, as a further verification of the A-to-I(G) editing of E12A transcript, Sanger sequencing of the genomic region corresponding to the editing sites excluded the interference of SNP (Fig. 1H). Taken together, these findings demonstrated that the E12A transcript, a novel HNRPLL splicing variant, is targeted by ADARs-mediated RNA editing. Given the possible involvement of both ADAR1 and ADAR2 in E12A RNA editing, we set out to delineate the mode and consequence of this enzymatic regulation. Because both the p110 and p150 isoforms of ADAR1 are known to possess deaminase activity, we first aimed to distinguish the isoform responsible for E12A editing. For this purpose, we generated isoform-specific expression constructs with synonymous mutations that render their ectopic expression resistant to RNAi-mediated silencing. Although ADAR1 knockdown cells exhibited reduced editing at positions A and B, as shown in Fig. 1D, restoration of ADAR1 p110 in these cells via the RNAi-resistant expression construct rescued RNA editing at both sites (Fig. 2, A and B). By contrast, replenishing ADAR1 with an enzyme-deficient mutant (E912A) had no effect on E12A editing, confirming enzyme catalysis as a requirement of this regulation. Re-expression of ADAR1 p150 did not restore editing, thus excluding a connection to E12A editing. Because of the possible role of ADARs in expression regulation of edited genes (8Wang I.X. So E. Devlin J.L. Zhao Y. Wu M. Cheung V.G. ADAR regulates RNA editing, transcript stability, and gene expression.Cell Rep. 2013; 5 (24183664): 849-86010.1016/j.celrep.2013.10.002Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 22Anantharaman A.

ADAR1 depletion decreased the expression levels of the E12A transcript, whereas ectopic re-expression of enzymatically inactive ADAR1 failed to discernably alter target abundance (Fig. 2, C and E, Fig. S2, A and B). To further highlight the importance of deaminase activity in this functional context, a dominant-negative ADAR1 mutant construct (G1007R) (24Rice G.I. Kasher P.R. Forte G.M. Mannion N.M.

In terms of ADAR2 and its editing activity, we found that overexpression of ADAR2 in HeLa cells markedly up-regulated the expression and editing of the E12A transcript (Fig. 2, C–G). This phenotype was similarly observed in HEK293 and MCF7 cells (Fig. S2, C and D). Incidentally, WT ADAR2 enhanced E12A expression and editing in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. S2, E and F). Overexpression of enzymatically inactive ADAR2 (E396A) in these cell lines led to reduced expression and editing of the E12A transcript, underscoring the requirement for deamination in ADAR2-mediated regulation. Conversely, ADAR-altered cells showed negligible changes in the expression of WT HNRPLL RNA (Fig. 2, E and F, Fig. S2B) and protein (Fig. 2, A and C), suggesting that the reference form of HNRPLL is not a target of ADARs. Taken together, our results implicated ADAR1 p110 and ADAR2 deaminase activities in RNA editing and expression of the HNRPLL–E12A transcript. We next investigated the mechanistic basis underlying the RNA editing-dependent E12A expression changes. Because of the reported functional link of ADAR2 to mRNA decay machinery (22Anantharaman A. Tripathi V. Khan A. Yoon J.H. Singh D.K. Gholamalamdari O. Guang S. Ohlson J. Wahlstedt H. Öhman M. Jantsch M.F. Conrad N.K. Ma J. Gorospe M. Prasanth S.G. Prasanth K.V. ADAR2 regulates RNA stability by modifying access of decay-promoting RNA-binding proteins.Nucleic Acids Res. 2017; 45 (28053121): 4189-4201PubMed Google Scholar), we first assessed target transcript stability. To this end, we monitored temporal changes in RNA abundance in the presence of transcription inhibitor actinomycin D. EGR1, a known short-lived gene, served as an experimental control and displayed rapid decline in response to actinomycin D treatment (Fig. S3A). However, in ADAR2-overexpressing cells, time course detection of RNA abundance showed no difference in the turnover rates of both WT and E12A transcripts (Fig. 3A), therefore ruling out the involvement of the mRNA-decay mechanism in E12A regulation. Next, given that certain edited transcripts reportedly display distinct subcellular localizations via association with RNA shuttling factors such as P54 and STAU1 (25Zhang Z. Carmichael G.G. The fate of dsRNA in the nucleus: a p54(nrb)-containing complex mediates the nuclear retention of promiscuously A-to-I edited RNAs.Cell. 2001; 106 (11525732): 465-47510.1016/S0092-8674(01)00466-4Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar, 26Yang C.C.

We first performed subcellular fractionation, the extent of which was measured by expression of compartment-specific marker RNA (Fig. S3B). Subsequent qRT-PCR analysis first revealed that the E12A transcripts are expressed in both the nuclear and cytosolic fractions (Fig. 3B). Moreover, whereas ectopic ADAR2 elevated the overall abundance and site C editing of E12A (Fig. 3, B and C), it did not have any effect on the subcellular distribution of E12A (Fig. 3B). As a control, the relative levels of the HNRPLL reference RNA transcript between compartments remained unchanged in ADAR2-overexpressing cells (Fig. S3C). The lack of spatial changes thus indicated that RNA editing mediates E12A expression regulation irrespectively of subcellular localization of the transcript. PCR amplification of cDNA using primers specific to exon 10 and 3′ UTR of HNRPLL resulted in a product that is longer than the reference form (Fig. 3D) and later confirmed to be the exon 12A-inclusion variant (Fig. 3E). Isoform-specific amplification of the adjoining sequences at 5′ and 3′ sides of exon 12A illustrated that, aside from the included exon 12A, the E12A variant sequences are identical to reference HNRPLL transcripts (Fig. S3, D and E). Additionally, whereas HNRPLL-targeting shRNAs triggered down-regulation of both the reference and E12A variant transcripts, shRNAs specifically targeting the E12A sequence resulted in limited repression of the reference transcript (Fig. S4, A and B), further pinpointing the novel exon 12A as the structural distinction between the two HNRPLL transcript forms. Based on these observations, together with the results that ADARs regulate E12A RNA levels without affecting the reference RNA level, we hypothesized that ADARs might modulate the splicing of this region to give rise to the alternative E12A transcript. In support of this notion, ectopic expression of WT ADAR2 promoted the incorporation of exon 12A in HNRPLL transcripts, but had no effect on the levels of the reference transcript (Fig. 3D). In line with the requirement for deamination in this regulation, expression of enzymatically-inactive ADAR2 conversely only marginally influenced the extent of exon 12A inclusion. To further strengthen this ADAR-mediated regulation of E12A splicing, we next employed a splicing reporter assay. For this purpose, we established a minigene reporter construct (27Nasim M.T. Eperon I.C. A double-reporter splicing assay for determining splicing efficiency in mammalian cells.Nat.

Widespread RNA editing of embedded Alu elements in the human transcriptome.Genome Res. 2004; 14 (15342557): 1719-172510.1101/gr.2855504Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar), and the editing complementary Alu repeat for E12A was identified in intron 12 and thus part of the reporter construct (Fig. S4C). Additionally, the translation initiation codons in the acceptor and luciferase sequences were removed by mutagenesis to reduce interference from leaky reporter protein expression. Based on our design, expression of the luciferase reporter thus signify splicing of the ectopic HNRPLL exons into a coding sequence in-frame with the luciferase gene, therefore serving as a readout for our assay (Fig. 3F). The feasibility of our minigene reporter construct was confirmed by its editability, we were able to detect specific occurrence of A-to-G changes at the three editing locations in the ectopic expressed sequences (Fig. S4D). Using this reporter construct, we found that overexpression of WT ADAR2 led to elevated luciferase activity (Fig. 3G), illustrating the role of RNA editing in HNRPLL splicing. The ADAR2 mutant had a negligible effect on the levels of the reporter as compared with the control vector group, thus affirming that deamination is requisite for HNRPLL alternative splicing (Fig. 3G). We also repeated the reporter assay using a noneditable version of the minigene reporter (termed Mutant Minigene), which was altered to express guanosines instead of adenosines at the editing positions. Intriguingly, ADAR2 overexpression did not induce an up-regulation of the noneditable reporter (Fig. 3G), indicating that ADAR-directed A-to-G transition on the transcript determines the splicing event. Furthermore, we did not observe any changes in the HNRPLL transcription rate in the ADAR2-overexpressing cells, thus excluding the possibility that the HNRPLL gene is transcriptionally regulated by ADAR2 (Fig. S4E). In conclusion, our results in this part demonstrated that ADAR-catalyzed deamination on the E12A transcript contributes to the splicing outcome and consequently variant expression. Upon establishing the positive role of RNA editing in alternative splicing of HNRPLL, we next examined whether the mature and the unspliced forms of E12A are differe"

Recently, the Ministry of Health and partners have increased integration and co-location of TB/HIV services, but the timing of antiretroviral therapy (ART) relative to TB treatment—a marker of program quality and predictor of outcomes—is unknown. Methods We conducted a retrospective analysis of programmatic data from 11 purposefully-sampled facilities to evaluate timely ART provision for HIV-positive TB patients enrolled on TB treatment between July-November 2014. Timely ART was defined as within two weeks of TB treatment initiation for patients with CD4<50/μL or missing, and within eight weeks otherwise. Descriptive statistics were estimated and logistic regression used to assess factors independently associated with timely ART. Results Of 466 HIV-positive TB patients, 51.5% were male, median age was 35 (interquartile range [IQR]: 29–42), and median CD4 was 137/μL (IQR: 58–268). 189 (40.6%) were on ART prior to, and five (1.8%) did not receive ART within six months of TB treatment initiation. Median time to ART after TB treatment initiation was 15 days (IQR: 14–28). Almost 90% started ART within eight weeks, and 45.5% of those with CD4<50/μL started within two weeks. Using thresholds for “timely ART” according to baseline CD4 count, 73.3% of patients overall received timely ART after TB treatment initiation. Patients with CD4 50-200/μL or ≥200/μL had significantly higher odds of timely ART than patients with CD4<50/μL, with adjusted odds ratios of 11.5 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 5.0–26.6) and 9.6 (95% CI: 4.6–19.9), respectively. TB cure or treatment completion was achieved by 71.1% of patients at six months, but this was not associated with timely ART. Conclusions This study demonstrates the relative success of integrated and co-located TB/HIV services in Swaziland, and shows that timely ART uptake for HIV-positive TB patients can be achieved in resource-limited, but integrated settings. Gaps remain in getting patients with CD4<50/μL to receive ART within the recommended two weeks post TB treatment initiation."
https://openalex.org/W2803283826,"Enniatins are common contaminants of food and feed and belong to the group of the “emerging” mycotoxins, which are produced by various Fusarium species. Although a wide range of toxic effects, like antibacterial, antifungal, insecticidal and cytotoxic properties, have been described in vitro, so far, no cases of mycotoxicosis connected to enniatins in vivo are reported. Among this group of mycotoxins, enniatin B and enniatin B1 are the most prevalent compounds and therefore are present in the human diet. Enniatins can reach systemic circulation, thus, the investigation of possible neurotoxic effects is of importance. Different cerebral cells were used to address effects on cell death having an impact on the blood-brain barrier. The influence of enniatin B and enniatin B1 on cellular viability was examined via Cell Counting kit-8 assay (CCK-8) in three different cell types of the blood-brain barrier: porcine brain capillary endothelial cells (PBCEC), human brain microvascular endothelial cells (HBMEC) and human astrocytoma cells (CCF-STTG1). CCF-STTG1 cells were more sensitive to enniatin B (IC50 = 8.9 μM) and enniatin B1 (IC50 = 4.4 μM) than both endothelial cell types. In CCF-STTG1 cells, caspase-3 activation and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release were evaluated. Both compounds did not induce any LDH release and only enniatin B increased caspase-3 activity as a marker for apoptosis. The transport kinetics of enniatin B and enniatin B1 across the blood-brain barrier in vitro were evaluated using PBCEC, cultivated on Transwell® filter inserts. Analysis of the apical and the basolateral compartment by high performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry revealed high influx rates for enniatin B and enniatin B1. Thus, both compounds can reach the brain parenchyma where neurotoxic effects cannot be ruled out."

Herein, we investigated whether the newly introduced I-scan optical enhancement (OE) can accurately predict polyp histology in vivo in real-time. Methods In this prospective three-phased study, 84 patients with 230 diminutive colorectal polyps were included. During the first two study phases, five endoscopists assessed whether analysis of polyp colour, surface and vascular pattern under i-scan OE can differentiate in vivo between adenomatous and hyperplastic polyps. Finally, junior and experienced endoscopists (JE, EE, each n = 4) not involved in the prior study phases made a post hoc diagnosis of polyp histology using a static i-scan OE image database. Histopathology was used as a gold-standard in all study phases. Results The overall accuracy of i-scan OE for histology prediction was 90% with a sensitivity, specificity, positive (PPV) and negative prediction value (NPV) of 91%, 90%, 86% and 94%, respectively. In high confidence predictions, the diagnostic accuracy increased to 93% with sensitivity, specificity, PPV and NPV of 94%, 91%, 89% and 96%. Colonoscopy surveillance intervals were predicted correctly in ≥ 90% of patients. In the post hoc analysis EE predicted polyp histology under i-scan OE with an overall accuracy of 91%. After a single training session, JE achieved a comparable diagnostic performance for predicting polyp histology with i-scan OE. Conclusion The histology of diminutive colorectal polyps can be accurately predicted with i-scan OE in vivo in real-time. Furthermore, polyp differentiation with i-scan OE appears to require only a short learning curve."
https://openalex.org/W2803874412,"Calcium is an important second messenger in plants that is released into the cytosol early after recognition of various environmental stimuli. Decoding of such calcium signals by calcium sensors is the key for the plant to react appropriately to each stimulus. Several members of Calmodulin-like proteins (CMLs) act as calcium sensors and some are known to mediate both abiotic and biotic stress responses. Here, we study the role of the Arabidopsis thaliana CML9 in different stress responses. CML9 was reported earlier as defense regulator against Pseudomonas syringae. In contrast to salicylic acid-mediated defense against biotrophic pathogens such as P. syringae, defenses against herbivores and necrotrophic fungi are mediated by jasmonates. We demonstrate that CML9 is induced upon wounding and feeding of the insect herbivore Spodoptera littoralis. However, neither different CML9 loss-of-function mutant lines nor overexpression lines were impaired upon insect feeding. No difference in herbivore-induced phytohormone elevation was detected in cml9 lines. The defense against the spider mite Tetranychus urticae was also unaffected. In addition, cml9 mutant lines showed a wild type-like reaction to the necrotrophic fungus Alternaria brassicicola. Thus, our data suggest that CML9 might be a regulator involved only in the defense against biotrophic pathogens, independent of jasmonates. In addition, our data challenge the involvement of CML9 in plant drought stress response. Taken together, we suggest that CML9 is a specialized rather than a general regulator of stress responses in Arabidopsis."
https://openalex.org/W2803231457,"Pathogenic microorganisms must adapt to changes in their immediate surroundings, including alterations in pH, to survive the shift from the external environment to that of the infected host. In the basidiomycete fungal pathogen Cryptococcus neoformans, these pH changes are primarily sensed by the fungus-specific, alkaline pH-sensing Rim/Pal pathway. The C. neoformans Rim pathway has diverged significantly from that described in ascomycete fungi. We recently identified the C. neoformans putative pH sensor Rra1, which activates the Rim pathway in response to elevated pH. In this study, we probed the function of Rra1 by analyzing its cellular localization and performing protein co-immunoprecipitation to identify potential Rra1 interactors. We found that Rra1 does not strongly colocalize or interact with immediate downstream Rim pathway components. However, these experiments identified a novel Rra1 interactor, the previously uncharacterized C. neoformans nucleosome assembly protein 1 (Nap1), which was required for Rim pathway activation. We observed that Nap1 specifically binds to the C-terminal tail of the Rra1 sensor, probably promoting Rra1 protein stability. This function of Nap1 is conserved in fungi closely related to C. neoformans that contain Rra1 orthologs, but not in the more distantly related ascomycete fungus Saccharomyces cerevisiae. In conclusion, our findings have revealed the sophisticated, yet distinct, molecular mechanisms by which closely and distantly related microbial phyla rapidly adapt to environmental signals and changes, such as alterations in pH.

In conclusion, our findings have revealed the sophisticated, yet distinct, molecular mechanisms by which closely and distantly related microbial phyla rapidly adapt to environmental signals and changes, such as alterations in pH. As any cell transitions from one environment to another, it must adapt to variations in its extracellular conditions. Specifically, microbial pathogens must rapidly sense and adapt to the many changes in environment that are encountered upon entering a host. For example, a human host might present many extreme stresses relating to the external environment for a pathogen, including an elevated temperature, alterations in pH, limited nutrient availability, and other stresses, such as those associated with an activated immune response. The pathogen must respond to these many stressful conditions to survive in the host. One of the most important ways in which fungi sense their external environment is through the Rim/PalpH response pathway. This fungus-specific pathway is involved in cellular signaling in response to alkaline pH, ultimately regulating gene expression to adapt to this environmental stressor. This pathway is required for survival at elevated pH across many fungal species (1O'Meara T.R. Xu W. Selvig K.M. O'Meara M.J. Mitchell A.P. Alspaugh J.A.

Indeed, many pathogenic species seem to have co-opted this pathway for use as a sensor of host conditions. For example, as it transitions to the neutral to alkaline pH of the host, the human fungal pathogen C. albicans requires its Rim signaling pathway to activate genes involved in the yeast-hyphal transition, a process required for tissue invasion (2Davis D.

The yeast-like fungus C. neoformans is a neuropathogen in immunocompromised hosts, and the RIM101 transcription factor gene is one of the most highly induced genes in the setting of cryptococcal infection (11Chen Y.

Interestingly, C. neoformans Rim pathway signaling is required for full expression of the most important cell feature associated with Cryptococcus pathogenesis, the polysaccharide capsule (7O'Meara T.R.

Like the canonical Rim pathway pH sensor, Rra1 has seven predicted transmembrane domains and functions upstream of the Rim101 processing complex, including the ESCRT and Rim proteolysis complexes. Additionally, although no basidiomycetous fungi appear to have homologs of the Rim21 pH sensor, many, such as Cryptococcus gattii, Ustilago maydis, and Tremella mesenterica, have Rra1 homologs (15Ost K.S.

Whereas Rra1 may share structural similarities with the canonical Rim pathway pH sensor, it is unclear whether it activates downstream Rim pathway components in a similar manner.

In this work, we searched for novel upstream regulators of the Rim pathway in C. neoformans through the identification of specific interactors of the Rra1 pH sensor. We employed proteomic methods to identify potential Rra1 interactors, subsequently using genetic techniques to determine whether these potential interactors regulated the activation of the Rim pathway in C. neoformans. We functionally placed one of these identified interactors, nucleosome assembly protein 1 (Nap1), in the Rim pathway as a Rra1 signaling partner.

To determine whether this Rra1 protein might serve as a sensor of extracellular pH, we created a Rra1-GFP fusion protein to assess its subcellular localization. This pHIS3-RRA1-GFP fusion protein construct consists of the RRA1 gene fused to GFP under control of the constitutively active histone H3 promoter. The pHIS3-RRA1-GFP construct was expressed in the rra1Δ mutant and shown to be functional, effectively rescuing the phenotypic defects demonstrated by the rra1Δ mutant strain, such as deficient growth on YPD pH 8 and YPD + 1.5 m NaCl (Fig. S1A). When incubated at pH 4 or pH 8, the Rra1-GFP protein localized diffusely within endomembrane-like structures. This endomembrane pattern of fluorescence resembles perinuclear ER localization, which can be visualized by the ER marker Sec63 (Fig. 1, A and B). Strikingly, the Rra1-GFP protein localized most intensely in puncta on the cell surface, particularly at pH 4 (Fig. 1A). These puncta are present near the plasma membrane regardless of pH. However, upon pathway activation at pH 8, these cell surface puncta appear to decrease in number and/or intensity (Fig. 1A). These data suggest that Rra1-GFP is located and is potentially functioning at the cell surface. Moreover, the Rra1-GFP fusion protein might be endocytosed or degraded upon pathway activation. The C. neoformans Rim pathway proteolysis complex consists of the ESCRT machinery (as a membrane-bound scaffolding component) and the Rim pathway–specific proteolysis complex components Rim13, Rim20, and Rim23 (15Ost K.S. O'Meara T.R. Huda N. Esher S.K. Alspaugh J.A. The Cryptococcus neoformans alkaline response pathway: identification of a novel rim pathway activator.PLoS Genet. 2015; 11 (25859664)e100515910.1371/journal.pgen.1005159Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). To probe the spatial relationship between the Rra1 protein and other Rim pathway components, we expressed the Rra1-GFP construct in a strain expressing the ESCRT machinery component Vps23 tagged with mCherry (pHIS3-mCherry-VPS23). When visualized using Z-stacked microscopic images, mCherry-Vps23 localizes to large, rare punctate structures within the cytosol, with most cells displaying only one of these structures (Fig. 1C). This strikingly focal, punctate pattern of mCherry-Vps23 fluorescence at pH 4 became more diffuse after a shift to pH 8, but it retained its cytosolic location (Fig. 1C). Although the Rra1-GFP signal also included distinct punctate structures, the Rra1-GFP puncta were present at the cell surface as opposed to the cytosol. Additionally, we did not observe colocalization of Rra1-GFP with the mCherry-Vps23 structures when incubated in either pathway-inactivating (pH 4) or pathway-activating (pH 8) conditions (Fig. 1C and Fig. S1B). We also expressed a Rra1-mCherry construct in a strain expressing the Rim proteolysis complex component Rim23 tagged with GFP (eRIM23-GFP). Rim23-GFP forms puncta at the cell surface at pH 8 (pathway-activating conditions), similar to the Rra1-GFP strain. However, we did not observe consistent colocalization between the Rra1- and Rim23-containing puncta at pathway-activating pH 8 (Fig. 1D). These results suggest that Rra1 primarily localizes in specific cellular sites that are spatially separated from more downstream Rim pathway components. Moreover, the Rra1 protein may be activating the Rim pathway without directly interacting with the ESCRT or Rim pathway proteolysis complexes. Our prior genetic studies to identify upstream activators of the Rim pathway revealed that Rra1 is required for Rim pathway activation. However, functional orthologs of additional upstream activators of the pathway in other species, including the Rim8/PalF arrestin and Rim9/PalI membrane protein, were not identified in C. neoformans using either genetic homology or genetic screens for Rim pathway activators (15Ost K.S. O'Meara T.R. Huda N. Esher S.K. Alspaugh J.A. The Cryptococcus neoformans alkaline response pathway: identification of a novel rim pathway activator.PLoS Genet. 2015; 11 (25859664)e100515910.1371/journal.pgen.1005159Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). We therefore sought to identify upstream activators of the Rim pathway by characterizing proteins that interact with Rra1 using co-immunoprecipitation techniques. We specifically sought potential Rra1-interacting proteins under pathway-activating (alkaline) pH conditions. The Rra1-GFP protein was immunoprecipitated from cell lysates using a GFP-Trap resin, and the proteins isolated in this manner were analyzed using tandem MS-MS. To exclude potential false-positive interactions, we focused on those proteins with at least three exclusive peptides that were present only in the Rra1-GFP sample and not in the control condition (Table 1). A full list of the potential interactors can be found in Table S1. This process yielded 41 proteins that were enriched in the Rra1-GFP sample. Of these, 25 represented proteins that were not ribosomal components or that were not highly expressed predicted members of metabolic pathways.Table 1Potential Rra1-GFP–interacting proteinsGene locus tagGene productPeptide countCNAG_03488Conserved hypothetical protein (Rra1)62CNAG_02091Nucleosome assembly protein18CNAG_002373-Isopropylmalate dehydratase8CNAG_0292860S ribosomal protein l5-b6CNAG_05823Conserved hypothetical protein6CNAG_00774d-3-Phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase 25CNAG_00605Cytoplasmic protein5CNAG_02100Fatty acid synthase complex protein5CNAG_06112Carbamoyl-phosphate synthase arginine-specific large chain4CNAG_06061Eukaryotic translation initiation factor 3 subunit 64CNAG_02814Glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase4CNAG_00891ATP-binding cassette transporter4CNAG_01655Dynamin4CNAG_03298Hypothetical protein4CNAG_05650Ubiquitin C-terminal hydrolase 54CNAG_04984Pleiotropic drug resistance protein4CNAG_02403Conserved hypothetical protein4CNAG_03202Adenylate cyclase3CNAG_02991Cofilin3CNAG_02485ATP synthase γ chain3CNAG_04803Structural molecule3CNAG_01682Mitochondrial outer membrane 72K protein3CNAG_02110N-terminal acetyltransferase3CNAG_00990CIPB3CNAG_05292α,α-trehalose-phosphate synthase3CNAG_03904Endopeptidase3CNAG_00686Conserved hypothetical protein3CNAG_07628Translation initiation factor eIF3c3CNAG_02099Fatty acid synthase β subunit3CNAG_01000Nucleoporin Nup157/1703CNAG_00104mRNA export factor Elf13CNAG_03701Arom polypeptide3CNAG_04111Lectin3CNAG_00092Mitochondrial protein3CNAG_03606EF Tu/GTP-binding protein3CNAG_03270Adenylosuccinate lyase3CNAG_02372Conserved hypothetical protein3CNAG_00522C2 domain-containing protein3CNAG_02794Dihydroorotate dehydrogenase3CNAG_0108326S proteasome non-ATPase regulatory subunit 123CNAG_01961MSP domain-containing protein3CNAG_06813CAP13 Open table in a new tab Consistent with the above colocalization experiments, none of the ESCRT proteins nor any other known Rim pathway components were represented among the putative Rra1-GFP interactors. This observation further corroborates the hypothesis that there is spatial separation between the Rra1-containing pH-sensing complex and the more downstream Rim pathway proteolysis complex in C. neoformans. Of the remaining candidate Rra1 interactors, the most highly represented protein was C. neoformans nucleosome assembly protein 1 (Nap1), with 18 exclusive unique peptides identified by tandem MS. To confirm the Rra1–Nap1 interaction implied by the proteomics data, we performed co-immunoprecipitation (co-IP) experiments using strains expressing Rra1-GFP (15Ost K.S. O'Meara T.R. Huda N. Esher S.K. Alspaugh J.A. The Cryptococcus neoformans alkaline response pathway: identification of a novel rim pathway activator.PLoS Genet. 2015; 11 (25859664)e100515910.1371/journal.pgen.1005159Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). We immunoprecipitated Rra1-GFP using GFP-Trap beads as described above (Fig. 2). For Western blot analysis of these samples, we used an antibody directed against S. cerevisiae Nap1. In our Western blots, we found that this antibody recognized two bands of appropriate sizes in C. neoformans. Importantly, these bands are absent in nap1Δ mutant strains, confirming that this antibody is able to specifically detect the C. neoformans Nap1 protein. To determine whether Nap1 interacts with downstream Rim pathway components, we repeated this process using a strain expressing Rim23-GFP. These results verified our MS data, showing that Nap1 co-immunoprecipitates with Rra1-GFP, but not with Rim23-GFP, confirming a specific interaction between Nap1 and Rra1. (Fig. 2). To further characterize the function of the Nap1 protein, we created a fusion protein expression construct in which Nap1 was tagged with GFP at its C terminus. When this construct was expressed in the nap1Δ mutant strain, all nap1Δ phenotypes were rescued (Fig. S1C), indicating that the addition of the GFP tag did not significantly affect Nap1 function. We assessed the localization of Nap1-GFP at both pH 4 and pH 8. Like S. cerevisiae Nap1, C. neoformans Nap1-GFP appears to localize largely within the cytosol and displays similar localization at both pH 4 and pH 8 (Fig. 3A) (20Calvert M.E.K. Keck K.M. Ptak C. Shabanowitz J. Hunt D.F. Pemberton L.F. Phosphorylation by casein kinase 2 regulates Nap1 localization and function.Mol. Cell Biol. 2008; 28 (18086883): 1313-132510.1128/MCB.01035-07Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Nap1-GFP is excluded from cytosolic vesicles, as well as being present at much lower levels in the nucleus and large vacuoles (Fig. 3B). Unlike the Rra1-GFP protein, Nap1-GFP is not isolated to membranes. These data suggest that Nap1 is largely localized and functioning in the cytosol. To assess potential sites of Rra1 and Nap1 interaction, we created a strain expressing both the Rra1-GFP construct described above and a C-terminally tagged Nap1-mCherry expression construct. We assessed the localization of Rra1-GFP and Nap1-mCherry by capturing Z-stacked images (Fig. 3C). We did not observe significant colocalization of Rra1-GFP cell surface puncta and Nap1-mCherry in either inactivating (pH 4) or activating conditions (pH 8). However, on rare occasions, we did observe some colocalization between intracellular Rra1-GFP punctate structures and Nap1. These results suggest that Rra1 and Nap1 interact most intensely when Rra1 is present on endomembranous structures or cytoplasmic puncta rather than at the plasma membrane or at more diffuse subcellular sites that are not appreciated by these microscopy methods. To determine whether the C. neoformans Nap1 protein is involved in Rim pathway activation, we created a strain with a complete deletion of the NAP1 gene (CNAG_02091). The resulting nap1Δ mutant strain demonstrated a slow-growth phenotype under otherwise permissive conditions: rich medium (YPD) at 30 °C (Fig. 4A). The nap1Δ strain grows even more slowly compared with the WT at 37 °C on YPD (Fig. 4A). This growth impairment is not shared by strains with mutations in established Rim pathway components. We also tested the nap1Δ mutant for phenotypes characteristic of Rim pathway mutants. Consistent with other Rim pathway mutants, the nap1Δ strain failed to grow at alkaline pH and on high-salt medium (Fig. 4A). This growth defect was not ameliorated with extended growth time to accommodate the slow growth of the nap1Δ mutant strain. Importantly, like other Rim pathway mutants, the alkaline pH growth defect in the nap1Δ mutant strain was suppressed by the expression of a truncated, constitutively active form of the Rim101 transcription factor (GFP-Rim101T) (Fig. 4B) (15Ost K.S.

SSE improved glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity in HFD-fed mice as was demonstrated previously in KK-Ay mice. Higher insulin sensitivity was validated by lower serum insulin and activation of the insulin signaling cascade in skeletal muscle and liver of SSE-treated mice in both models. H&E staining of the livers demonstrated lower severity of steatosis in SSE-treated mice. Several model-specific effects of SSE were observed-mRNA expression of proinflammatory genes and CD36 was reduced in SSE-treated KK-Ay mice. Hepatic mRNA expression of PEPCK was also reduced in SSE-treated KK-Ay mice, while other genes involved in carbohydrates and lipid metabolism were not affected. HFD-fed mice treated by SSE had elevated hepatic glycogen stores. Gluconeogenic gene expression was not affected, while GCK expression was increased. HFD-induced hepatic steatosis was not affected by SSE. However, while genes involved in lipid metabolism were downregulated by HFD, this was not found in HFD-fed mice given SSE, demonstrating an expression profile which is similar to that of standard diet-fed mice.Our study supports the insulin sensitizing activity of SSE and suggests that this extract might improve other manifestations of the metabolic syndrome."
https://openalex.org/W2803901659,"The protein kinase (PK, kinome) family is one of the largest families in plants and regulates almost all aspects of plant processes, including plant development and stress responses. Despite their important functions, comprehensive functional classification, evolutionary analysis and expression patterns of the cotton PK gene family has yet to be performed on PK genes. In this study, we identified the cotton kinomes in the Gossypium raimondii, Gossypium arboretum, Gossypium hirsutum and Gossypium barbadense genomes and classified them into 7 groups and 122-24 subfamilies using software HMMER v3.0 scanning and neighbor-joining (NJ) phylogenetic analysis. Some conserved exon-intron structures were identified not only in cotton species but also in primitive plants, ferns and moss, suggesting the significant function and ancient origination of these PK genes. Collinearity analysis revealed that 16.6 million years ago (Mya) cotton-specific whole genome duplication (WGD) events may have played a partial role in the expansion of the cotton kinomes, whereas tandem duplication (TD) events mainly contributed to the expansion of the cotton RLK group. Synteny analysis revealed that tetraploidization of G. hirsutum and G. barbadense contributed to the expansion of G. hirsutum and G. barbadense PKs. Global expression analysis of cotton PKs revealed stress-specific and fiber development-related expression patterns, suggesting that many cotton PKs might be involved in the regulation of the stress response and fiber development processes. This study provides foundational information for further studies on the evolution and molecular function of cotton PKs."

Decreased levels of ATPase sarcoplasmic/endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-transporting 2 (ATP2a2), the main calcium pump in β cells, are often found in individuals with diabetes and in diabetic animal models. However, the regulators of ATP2a2 and the molecular mechanisms responsible for controlling ATP2a2 activity remain unclear. Etoposide-induced protein 2.4 (Ei24) is also down-regulated in β cells of diabetic individuals, whereas the effect of decreased Ei24 level on β-cell function is not clarified. Here, using Cre-LoxP and CRISPR/Cas9-based genomic knockout (KO) approaches to generate pancreatic β cell–specific Ei24 KO mice and pancreatic β-cell lines, we found that Ei24 regulates ATP2a2 activity. Specifically, we observed that Ei24 binds to ATP2a2 through Ei24 residues 293–299, which we named here the ATP2a2-interacting region (AIR).

Gene expression profiles of beta-cell enriched tissue obtained by laser capture microdissection from subjects with type 2 diabetes.PLoS One. 2010; 5 (20644627)e1149910.1371/journal.pone.0011499Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar), which indicates that Ei24 is associated with multiple clinical consequences and that the physical and pathophysiological roles of Ei24 in pancreatic β cells should be explored. Here, we used the Cre-LoxP methodology and CRISPR-Cas9 genomic editing approaches to generate pancreatic β cell–specific Ei24 knockout (KO) mice and an Ei24 KO pancreatic β-cell line, respectively. The results showed that loss of Ei24 leads to glucose intolerance, decreased insulin biosynthesis, impaired β-cell cytosolic calcium homeostasis, reduced ER calcium levels, and increased apoptosis. Using a GFP-trap method, we demonstrated the interaction between Ei24 and ATP2a2 and identified a region of Ei24 involved in the interaction, which was termed the ATP2a2-interacting region (AIR). Moreover, in Ei24 knockout animals, we found a significant improvement in glucose intolerance induced by treatment with CDN1163, a small-molecule activator of ATP2a2, which indicated that Ei24 regulates ATP2a2 activity and is essential for pancreatic β-cell mass. To test the possible function of Ei24 in pancreatic β-cell function under a pathological condition, we first examined the levels of Ei24 in HFD-fed mice, ob/ob mice, and GK rats. Consistent with findings in T2D patients, Ei24 expression was significantly decreased in islets from the diabetic animal models compared with that in the controls. Notably, the level of Ei24 further decreased with prolonged consumption of an HFD, which further indicated the correlation between Ei24 levels and the diabetic process (Fig. 1A). Because homozygous loss of Ei24 is embryonically lethal (13Devkota S. Sung Y.H. Choi J.M. Lee J. Ha N.Y. Kim H. Cho B.C. Song J. Lee H.W.

Adipose-selective targeting of the GLUT4 gene impairs insulin action in muscle and liver.Nature. 2001; 409 (11217863): 729-73310.1038/35055575Crossref PubMed Scopus (950) Google Scholar), we checked the expression of Ei24 in liver, muscle, and fat tissues from Ei24 floxed mice and WT mice. The results showed no significant difference in Ei24 expression in non-β-cell tissues between Ei24 floxed mice and WT mice (Fig. S1). There were no differences in body mass (Fig. 1D) or fasting glucose concentration (Fig. 1E) between the WT and KO mice up to 28 weeks after birth. Considering that the course of diabetes is age-dependent for several diabetes mouse models, we measured these basic metabolic indices of the mice at 32 weeks of age. We found that the fasting glucose concentration and body weight were higher in Ei24 KO mice than in WT mice (Fig. S2), which indicated that with the increase in β-cell apoptosis, the diabetes phenotype becomes more apparent. A glucose tolerance test (GTT) administered at 10 weeks of age showed significant glucose intolerance in both male (Fig. 1F) and female (Fig. 1G) KO mice. In RIP-Cre transgenic mice, the RIP promoter drives CRE expression in both pancreatic β cells and the brain (15Wicksteed B. Brissova M. Yan W. Opland D.M. Plank J.L. Reinert R.B. Dickson L.M.

To exclude the influence of neurons expressing CRE activity, we generated proopiomelanocortin (POMC)-specific Ei24 knockout mice and found no difference in glucose tolerance between WT and POMC-specific Ei24 knockout (Ei24Δpomc) mice (Fig. S3). For the insulin-tolerance test (ITT), the insulin sensitivity of KO mice was comparable with that of the control group (Fig. 1, H and I), suggesting a primary defect in β-cell function. The results showed that fasting insulin levels were similar in the KO mice (0.32 ± 0.05 ng/ml) and the WT mice (0.33 ± 0.05 ng/ml) (Fig. 1J). The glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS) in vivo results showed that the serum insulin levels were increased significantly in the WT mice 30 min (0.61 ± 0.1 ng/ml) after glucose injections, whereas the insulin levels were significantly lower in the KO mice (0.38 ± 0.05 ng/ml) following glucose challenge (Fig. 1J). Similarly, the results from an ex vivo GSIS analysis of isolated islets showed that there was no significant difference in basal insulin secretion (when cultured with 2.8 mm glucose) from size-matched islets from the KO and WT mice. However, in response to the administration of 16.7 mm glucose, insulin secretion from islets isolated from the KO mice was slightly lower during the first phase (0–5 min) and remarkably lower during the second phase than that from islets isolated from control mice (Fig. 1K). To demonstrate that the increased insulin content in the WT group was not due to passive release from the dying cells, the glucose concentration was reverted back to 2.8 mm, and the insulin content was remeasured. The results showed that the insulin release returned to the basal level (Fig. 1K). This suggested that the impaired glucose tolerance in KO mice may be primarily caused by insufficient GSIS. Given that insufficient insulin release may be caused by β-cell abnormalities, we conducted a morphological analysis of the pancreatic islets. In contrast to the dense appearance of the WT islets, the KO islets became uncompact and transparent (Fig. 2A). Microscopic examination after hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining showed vacuolated cells in the islets of the KO mice that were not found in control mice (Fig. 2B). We hypothesized that these vacuole-like structures are associated with apoptotic cells. Thus, the relative β-cell mass was estimated by point counting after insulin immunohistochemistry (Fig. 2C), and the results showed lower β-cell mass in the KO mice (65 ± 10/10,000 μm2) than in the WT mice (92 ± 15/10,000 μm2, p < 0.001; Fig. 2D). Insulin granule number was then assessed by quantitative analysis of islet electron micrographic images. Typical mature insulin granules were observed as a dense homogeneous core with a clear halo (Fig. 2E). Fig. 2F shows that the number of mature insulin granules was decreased by ∼75% in the KO islets compared with the WT group. Consistent with the decreased insulin granules and β-cell mass in the KO mice, both proinsulin and insulin protein levels in the islets of the KO mice were significantly lower than those of the WT mice (Fig. 2, G and H). Furthermore, increased protein levels of cleaved poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (c-PARP) and cleaved caspase-3 (c-caspase-3), which mark apoptotic cascades within cells, were observed in the islets of the KO mice (Fig. 2I). These findings may account for the lack of β-cell mass as well as the decreased insulin production. To explore the molecular mechanism of increased apoptosis of pancreatic β cells in the KO mice, we measured the cytosolic ATP content and the activation of AMPK in pancreatic β cells, because β cells require a large amount of energy for insulin secretion and survival. As shown in Fig. 3A, no change in cellular ATP content was observed, but AMPK and its substrate phosphorylated acetyl-CoA carboxylase (p-ACC) were observed to be deactivated in the KO β cells (Fig. 3B). In line with the activation of AMPK, the activity of CAMKK2 was down-regulated in the KO group (Fig. 3C). To evaluate whether the reduced activation of AMPK due to the loss of Ei24 is responsible for the elevated β-cell apoptosis, we treated WT and KO islets with the AMPK activator 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide ribonucleotide (AICAR). Notably, AICAR activated AMPK and rescued the KO β cells from apoptosis (Fig. 3D). Taken together, these data implicated Ei24 as an important regulator of AMPK activation for β-cell survival. Using CRISPR-Cas9 genomic editing approaches, the Ei24 KO pancreatic β-cell line was generated (Fig. 4, A and B). Considering that CAMKK2 is a Ca2+-related kinase that regulates AMPK activity in other cells (17Woods A. Dickerson K. Heath R. Hong S.P. Momcilovic M. Johnstone S.R. Carlson M. Carling D. Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase kinase-β acts upstream of AMP-activated protein kinase in mammalian cells.Cell Metab. 2005; 2 (16054096): 21-3310.1016/j.cmet.2005.06.005Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1066) Google Scholar) and that stimulation by increased intracellular Ca2+ levels increases activation of AMPK, we speculated that loss of Ei24 may decrease the cytosolic calcium concentration. However, the intracellular Ca2+ level was clearly elevated in the KO group (Fig. 4C). We next estimated the ER Ca2+ content by challenging WT and Ei24 KO INS1 cell lines with ER-targeted GCaMP6, a fluorescent calcium indicator (18de Juan-Sanz J. Holt G.T. Schreiter E.R. de Juan F. Kim D.S. Ryan T.A. Axonal endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ content controls release probability in CNS nerve terminals.Neuron. 2017; 93 (28162809): 867-881.e610.1016/j.neuron.2017.01.010Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Fig. 4D shows that the loss of Ei24 significantly lowered the ER Ca2+ content in the KO cells compared with the WT cells. The filling state of the ER Ca2+ store was further confirmed by the presence of the irreversible ATP2a2 inhibitor thapsigargin (TG) in Ca2+-free medium. Depletion of Ei24 caused a steady-state damage of ER Ca2+ content by ∼30% compared with the WT group (Fig. 4E), which further indicated that loss of Ei24 diminishes the content of the Ca2+ pool. ATP2a2 is a Ca2+ ATPase that transports Ca2+ from the cytosol to the ER lumen and plays an important role in maintaining the ER Ca2+ content. Because loss of Ei24 depletes the ER Ca2+ store, we further studied the relationship between Ei24 and ATP2a2. Laser-scanning confocal imaging showed good co-localization between the EGFP-tagged ATP2a2 and mApple-labeled Ei24 in MIN6 cells (Fig. 5A). Superresolution imaging by structured illumination microscopy (SIM) was employed to analyze the localization of Ei24 and ATP2a2 further. The results showed good co-localization between the EGFP-tagged Ei24 and mCherry-labeled ATP2a2 (Fig. S4). Moreover, we performed coimmunoprecipitation assays and observed that Ei24 specifically bound to ATP2a2 (Fig. 5, B and C). To characterize the interaction between Ei24 and ATP2a2 in more detail, we assessed the binding of ATP2a2 to Ei24 mutants. As shown in Fig. 5D, residues 278–340, which represent the predicted C-terminal domain of Ei24, were essential for binding with ATP2a2. Next, the dichotomy method was applied, and a series of truncation mutants were constructed. As shown in Fig. 5D, Ei24 mutants missing residues 304–340 were dispensable for binding with ATP2a2, suggesting that the critical binding domain resided between residues 278 and 303. The mutants missing residues 293–299 no longer bound at levels equal to that of the control column, which indicated that this region is the critical binding domain of Ei24 for binding with ATP2a2 (Fig. 5D), which we name the AIR domain. The ATP2a2 activity was further studied and was shown to be significantly lower in the microsome fraction purified from the Ei24 KO cells than in microsomes from the WT cells (Fig. 5E), suggesting that Ei24 promotes ATP2a2 activity through direct interaction. We next examined whether apoptosis of Ei24-depleted primary β cells could be rescued by increasing ATP2a2 activity. CDN1163 is reported as a small molecular activator of ATP2a2 that increases ER Ca2+ content (19Kang S. Dahl R. Hsieh W. Shin A. Zsebo K.M. Buettner C. Hajjar R.J. Lebeche D. Small molecular allosteric activator of the sarco/endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase (SERCA) attenuates diabetes and metabolic disorders.J. Biol.

Following CDN1163 treatment, the [Ca2+]ER pool was significantly increased (Fig. 6A), whereas basal [Ca2+]i was decreased in the KO group (Fig. 6B). Moreover, CDN1163 treatment considerably rescued the activation of CAMKK2, which further induced AMPK activation and attenuated the apoptosis of β cells induced by the loss of Ei24 (Fig. 6, C–F). To examine whether the pharmacological activation of ATP2a2 with CDN1163 could improve glucose tolerance in the KO mice, GTT was performed on 10-week-old mice, which were intraperitoneally injected with CDN1163 (50 mg/kg) or a vehicle (5% DMSO, 10% Tween in 0.9% NaCl) once a day for a total of 10 days. The results showed that the CDN1163-treated KO mice exhibited improved glucose tolerance after treatment compared with the vehicle-treated KO mice; however, glucose tolerance in the control WT group was not altered by CDN1163 (Fig. 7, A and B). The insulin tolerance test that was administered on day 15 indicated that the insulin sensitivity did not significantly change (Fig. 7, C and D), further suggesting the protective role of CDN1163 on β cells. These results strongly emphasize a pivotal role for ATP2a2 activity, which is modulated by Ei24 in the maintenance of calcium homeostasis and β-cell functions.Figure 7.Increased ATP2a2 activity could rescue glucose intolerance in Ei24 KO mice.

However, in pancreatic islets from diabetic patients, which are characterized by severe loss of pancreatic β-cell number, Ei24 expression level was markedly decreased (12Marselli L. Thorne J. Dahiya S. Sgroi D.C. Sharma A. Bonner-Weir S. Marchetti P. Weir G.C. Gene expression profiles of beta-cell enriched tissue obtained by laser capture microdissection from subjects with type 2 diabetes.PLoS One. 2010; 5 (20644627)e1149910.1371/journal.pone.0011499Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). We propose that Ei24 may play a role in pancreatic β cells different from that in other cells. In the current study, we showed strong evidence that the function of Ei24 is essential for β-cell mass and function. First, we found reduced Ei24 protein levels in pancreatic β cells from both diabetic ob/ob mice and GK rats. HFD feeding decreases Ei24 levels in islets; further, prolonged consumption of an HFD suggested a correlation between Ei24 levels and the diabetic process. Next, Ei24 KO β cells demonstrated Ca2+ dyshomeostasis, decreased insulin vesicles, impaired insulin secretion, and impaired β-cell survival. These results suggest that in contrast to the negative function of suppressing cell growth and inducing cell death in cancer (20Gu Z. Flemington C. Chittenden T. Zambetti G.P. ei24, a p53 response gene involved in growth suppression and apoptosis.Mol. Cell.

Rescue of Ei24 expression in the pancreas in diabetic patients could have clinically beneficial effects on β-cell function and may serve as a novel potential therapeutic treatment. The course of diabetes is age-dependent for several mouse models of diabetes (23Rees D.A. Alcolado J.C. Animal models of diabetes mellitus.Diabetic Med. 2005; 22 (15787657): 359-37010.1111/j.1464-5491.2005.01499.xCrossref PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar). There are no significant differences in basal glucose concentration and body weight between Ei24 KO mice and WT mice from 4 to 28 weeks.

https://openalex.org/W2804476031,"Inflammatory breast cancer (IBC) is a rare and aggressive presentation of invasive breast cancer with a 62% to 68% 5-year survival rate. It is the most lethal form of breast cancer, and early recognition and treatment is important for patient survival. Like non-inflammatory breast cancer, IBC comprises multiple subtypes, with the triple-negative subtype being overrepresented. Although the current multimodality treatment regime of anthracycline- and taxane-based neoadjuvant therapy, surgery, and radiotherapy has improved the outcome of patients with triple-negative IBC, overall survival continues to be worse than in patients with non-inflammatory locally advanced breast cancer. Translation of new therapies into the clinics to successfully treat IBC has been poor, in part because of the lack of in vitro preclinical models that can accurately predict the response of the original tumor to therapy. We report the generation of a preclinical IBC patient-derived xenograft (PDX)-derived ex vivo (PDXEx) model and show that it closely replicates the tissue architecture of the original PDX tumor harvested from mice. The gene expression profile of our IBC PDXEx model had a high degree of correlation to that of the original tumor. This suggests that the process of generating the PDXEx model did not significantly alter the molecular signature of the original tumor. We demonstrate a high degree of similarity in drug response profile between a PDX mouse model and our PDXEx model generated from the same original PDX tumor tissue and treated with the same panel of drugs, indicating that our PDXEx model had high predictive value in identifying effective tumor-specific therapies. Finally, we used our PDXEx model as a platform for a robotic-based high-throughput drug screen of a 386-drug anti-cancer compound library. The top candidates identified from this drug screen all demonstrated greater therapeutic efficacy than the standard-of-care drugs used in the clinic to treat triple-negative IBC, doxorubicin and paclitaxel. Our PDXEx model is simple, and we are confident that it can be incorporated into a PDX mouse system for use as a first-pass screening platform. This will permit the identification of effective tumor-specific therapies with high predictive value in a resource-, time-, and cost-efficient manner."

Trends of CVD risk factors were estimated using generalized estimation equation (GEE) models, by adjusting for gender, age and propensity scores.The adjusted prevalence of general and central adiposity, diabetes and physical inactivity at baseline was 25.18, 60.14, 25.03 and 43.74%, respectively and had increasing trends during the study period, reaching 41.32, 66.74, 43.20 and 50.32%, respectively, at the last visit. Although systolic, but not diastolic blood pressure, decreased from 134.88 to 129.86 mmHg, the prevalence of hypertension did not decrease (64.21% vs 68%, p value = 0.326). The prevalence of low high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), hypertriglyceridemia and high non-HDL-C at baseline was 74.54, 59.89 and 96.53%, respectively, and showed improved trends reaching 44.87, 47.12 and 96.06% respectively; however, the favorable trend was not observed for high low density cholesterol. Significant increasing trends were observed in the consumption of anti-hypertensive, lipid and glucose lowering medications, but not for aspirin. The prevalence of current smoking (11.05 vs 16.83%, p value = 0.042) and chronic kidney disease (44.16 vs 51.65%, p value = 0.054) increased during follow up.Except for lipid profile status, dangerous trends for other CVD risk factors were demonstrated among CVD patients, which can be a harbinger for high rates of CVD mortality; these findings highlight the need for urgent implementation of multicomponent interventions to control CVD risk factors among these patients."

They exhibit antiviral activities against certain viruses during infection of the liver and mucosal tissues. Here we report that IFNλ restricts in vitro replication of the β-herpesvirus murine cytomegalovirus (mCMV). However, IFNλR1-deficient (Ifnλr1-/-) mice were not preferentially susceptible to mCMV infection in vivo during acute infection after systemic or mucosal challenge, or during virus persistence in the mucosa. Instead, our studies revealed that IFNλ influences NK cell responses during mCMV infection. Ifnλr1-/- mice exhibited defective development of conventional interferon-gamma (IFNγ)-expressing NK cells in the spleen during mCMV infection whereas accumulation of granzyme B-expressing NK cells was unaltered. In vitro, development of splenic IFNγ+ NK cells following stimulation with IL-12 or, to a lesser extent, IL-18 was abrogated by IFNλR1-deficiency. Thus, IFNλ regulates NK cell responses during mCMV infection and restricts virus replication in vitro but is redundant in the control of acute and persistent mCMV replication within mucosal and non-mucosal tissues."
https://openalex.org/W2803776223,"Phylogeny of hard ticks (Ixodidae) remains unresolved. Mitochondrial genomes (mitogenomes) are increasingly used to resolve phylogenetic controversies, but remain unavailable for the entire large Hyalomma genus. Hyalomma asiaticum is a parasitic tick distributed throughout the Asia. As a result of great morphological variability, two subspecies have been recognised historically; until a morphological data-based synonymization was proposed. However, this hypothesis was never tested using molecular data. Therefore, objectives of this study were to: 1. sequence the first Hyalomma mitogenome; 2. scrutinise the proposed synonymization using molecular data, i.e. complete mitogenomes of both subspecies: H. a. asiaticum and kozlovi; 3. conduct phylogenomic and comparative analyses of all available Ixodidae mitogenomes. Results corroborate the proposed synonymization: the two mitogenomes are almost identical (99.6%). Genomic features of both mitogenomes are standard for Metastriata; which includes the presence of two control regions and all three ""Tick-Box"" motifs. Gene order and strand distribution are perfectly conserved for the entire Metastriata group. Suspecting compositional biases, we conducted phylogenetic analyses (29 almost complete mitogenomes) using homogeneous and heterogeneous (CAT) models of substitution. The results were congruent, apart from the deep-level topology of prostriate ticks (Ixodes): the homogeneous model produced a monophyletic Ixodes, but the CAT model produced a paraphyletic Ixodes (and thereby Prostriata), divided into Australasian and non-Australasian clades. This topology implies that all metastriate ticks have evolved from the ancestor of the non-Australian branch of prostriate ticks. Metastriata was divided into three clades: 1. Amblyomminae and Rhipicephalinae (Rhipicephalus, Hyalomma, Dermacentor); 2. Haemaphysalinae and Bothriocrotoninae, plus Amblyomma sphenodonti; 3. Amblyomma elaphense, basal to all Metastriata. We conclude that mitogenomes have the potential to resolve the long-standing debate about the evolutionary history of ticks, but heterogeneous evolutionary models should be used to alleviate the effects of compositional heterogeneity on deep-level relationships."

Here, we confirmed the co-localization of the Ca2+-activated Cl− channels anoctamin 1 (Ano1, also called TMEM16A) and Ano2 (TMEM16B) in microvilli of apically and basally located vomeronasal sensory neurons (VSNs) and their absence in supporting cells of the VNO.

Although these currents persisted in the VNOs of mice lacking Ano2, they were undetectable in olfactory neuron-specific Ano1 knockout mice irrespective of the presence of Ano2. The loss of Ca2+-activated Cl− currents resulted in diminished spontaneous and drastically reduced pheromone-evoked spiking of VSNs. Although this indicated an important role of anoctamin channels in VNO signal amplification, the lack of this amplification did not alter VNO-dependent male–male territorial aggression in olfactory Ano1/Ano2 double knockout mice. We conclude that Ano1 mediates the bulk of Ca2+-activated Cl− currents in the VNO and that Ano2 plays only a minor role.

VSNs are bipolar neurons that possess one unbranched dendrite that protrudes apically into the vomeronasal lumen. At their apical ends, they feature a dendritic knob from which mucus-embedded microvilli emerge. Microvilli and dendritic knobs are the sites where the VNO receptor potential is generated. Whereas dendritic knobs of all VSNs are located at the apical surface of the vomeronasal sensory epithelium (VNE), their cell bodies are organized in an apical and a basal layer. Single VSNs express receptors from two large G protein–coupled receptor families. Cell bodies of vomeronasal receptor type I–expressing VSNs reside within the apical layer and express the G protein subunit Gαi2, whereas vomeronasal receptors type II–positive VSNs are found in the basal layer of the sensory epithelium and express the G protein subunit Gαo (1Munger S.D.

Pheromones bind to microvilli of VSNs and thereby trigger the dissociation of the respective G protein complex. Their β- and γ-subunits then activate phospholipase C, which converts phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate into diacylglycerol and inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate.

The incomplete disruption of VNO function observed in TRPC2 knockout mice suggests an alternative activation pathway that bypasses TRPC2. It was postulated that it involves inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate–mediated Ca2+ release from intracellular stores and downstream activation of CaCCs, but this explanation was questioned recently (20Chamero P. Weiss J. Alonso M.T. Rodríguez-Prados M. Hisatsune C. Mikoshiba K. Leinders-Zufall T. Zufall F.

Rep. 2017; 7 (28860523)1026010.1038/s41598-017-09638-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). We and others have shown previously that the CaCCs anoctamin 1 and 2 (Ano1 and Ano2, or TMEM16A and TMEM16B) are co-expressed in the apical border of the vomeronasal sensory epithelium (21Dibattista M. Amjad A. Maurya D.K. Sagheddu C. Montani G. Tirindelli R. Menini A. Calcium-activated chloride channels in the apical region of mouse vomeronasal sensory neurons.J. Gen.

Although a constitutive knockout of Ano1 is postnatally lethal in mice, likely because of a malformation of the trachea (23Rock J.R. Futtner C.R. Harfe B.D. The transmembrane protein TMEM16A is required for normal development of the murine trachea.Dev. Biol. 2008; 321 (18585372): 141-14910.1016/j.ydbio.2008.06.009Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar), Ano2−/− mice did not show a severe phenotype (22Billig G.M. Pál B. Fidzinski P. Jentsch T.J. Ca2+-activated Cl− currents are dispensable for olfaction.Nat. Neurosci. 2011; 14 (21516098): 763-76910.1038/nn.2821Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Here we confirm the co-expression and co-localization of Ano1 and Ano2 in the microvilli of murine VSNs. Surprisingly, Ano1 carries the bulk of Ca2+-activated Cl− currents (ICl(Ca)) in VSNs, whereas Ano2 apparently plays only a minor role. Disruption of both channels in mouse VSNs resulted in diminished spontaneous and pheromone-evoked action potential firing. The loss of CaCCs, however, did not result in altered pheromone-induced territorial aggressiveness in male mice. Immunolabeling of paraffin sections of the mouse nose (Fig. 1A) showed that Ano1 and Ano2 co-localize close to the dendritic knob of VSNs and line the apical side of the sensory epithelium (Fig. 1B), in agreement with previous results (21Dibattista M. Amjad A. Maurya D.K. Sagheddu C. Montani G. Tirindelli R. Menini A. Calcium-activated chloride channels in the apical region of mouse vomeronasal sensory neurons.J. Gen.

Immunostaining of isolated VSNs consistently showed co-expression of both proteins. No cells expressing only one of these channels were detected (Fig. 1C). Co-staining for ezrin, a protein expressed on microvilli of VNO-supporting cells (24Dauner K. Lissmann J. Jeridi S. Frings S. Möhrlen F. Expression patterns of anoctamin 1 and anoctamin 2 chloride channels in the mammalian nose.Cell Tissue Res. 2012; 347 (22314846): 327-34110.1007/s00441-012-1324-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), showed a dotted intermittent expression pattern at the apical border of the sensory epithelium that neither co-localized with Ano1 nor with Ano2 (Fig. S1, A and B). Conversely, villin, which is also present in microvilli of VSNs, co-localized with Ano1 (not shown) and Ano2 (Fig. S1C). Hence, the expression of either channel is restricted to microvilli of VSNs. Because in VSNs the subcellular localization of either channel is almost completely restricted to microvilli, immunohistochemistry is ill suited to examine whether these channels are differentially expressed in apical or basal VSNs. We therefore addressed this issue by in situ hybridization that detects Ano1 and Ano2 transcripts in the cell bodies of VSNs. Hybridization of coronal VNO cryosections showed an even distribution of Ano1 and Ano2 mRNAs across both layers of the VNO sensory epithelium (Fig. 1D). Ano1-positive cells were also detected in the nonsensory epithelium, which agrees with the localization of Ano1-expressing mucus-secreting glandular cells and vascular smooth muscle cells in the VNO (1Munger S.D. Leinders-Zufall T. Zufall F. Subsystem organization of the mammalian sense of smell.Annu. Rev.

Negative controls using sense RNA probes for Ano1 or Ano2 gave no staining (Fig. 1D).

To determine which splice variants are present in the VNO, we performed RT-PCR on VNO tissue using primers that span exon boundaries and therefore hybridize only to spliced-together exons (see exon labels in Fig. 2). This analysis revealed that vomeronasal transcripts of Ano1 included exon 14 (Fig. 2A). Murine Ano2 mRNA was previously analyzed in tissue from the eye and the main olfactory epithelium (MOE) (26Stöhr H. Heisig J.B. Benz P.M. Schöberl S. Milenkovic V.M. Strauss O. Aartsen W.M.

Although an Ano2 isoform including exon 1a and exon 2 was found in the retina (later termed isoform A), in the MOE Ano2 is predominantly transcribed using an alternative start site at exon 1b while skipping exon 1a-2 (termed isoform B). A nonfunctional variant of isoform B that lacks exon 4 (termed isoform BΔ4; Fig. 2B) is also expressed in the MOE (25Ponissery Saidu S. Stephan A.B. Talaga A.K. Zhao H. Reisert J.

Physiol. 2013; 141 (23669718): 691-70310.1085/jgp.201210937Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). While our RT-PCR experiments revealed no expression of the retinal Ano2 isoform A in the VNO, Ano2 isoform B was present with and without exon 4. No Ano2 isoform containing exon 14 could be detected (Fig. 2B). Control experiments showed the expression of Ano2 isoform A in the eye and a lack of Ano2 in the liver (Fig. S2A). Sequencing of cDNAs from the VNO confirmed the existence of an exon 4-containing Ano2 mRNA. Additionally, a sequence overlap in the chromatogram revealed the co-expression of a variant lacking this alternatively spliced exon (Fig. S2B). To investigate the functional roles of CaCCs in the VNO, we generated mouse lines in which Ano1, Ano2, or both are absent from VSNs. Because constitutive deletion of Ano1 in mice is postnatally lethal, likely because of malformation of the trachea (23Rock J.R. Futtner C.R. Harfe B.D. The transmembrane protein TMEM16A is required for normal development of the murine trachea.Dev.

Floxed Ano1 mice (38Heinze C. Seniuk A. Sokolov M.V. Huebner A.K. Klementowicz A.E. Szijartó I.A. Schleifenbaum J. Vitzthum H. Gollasch M. Ehmke H. Schroeder B.C. Hübner C.A.

As expected, Ano1 immunoreactivity was absent from the apical part of the sensory epithelium in the VNO of ΔAno1olf mice, whereas Ano2 expression was not affected (Fig. 3A). Western blots of N-deglycosylated VNO lysates confirmed that Ano2 expression levels were unchanged in the VNO of ΔAno1olf (Fig. 3B). Ano1/2 olfactory double knockout mice (Δ(Ano1olf/Ano2)) were obtained by crossing ΔAno1olf mice to constitutive Ano2−/− (ΔAno2) mice. We have described ΔAno2 mice previously (22Billig G.M. Pál B. Fidzinski P. Jentsch T.J. Ca2+-activated Cl− currents are dispensable for olfaction.Nat. Neurosci. 2011; 14 (21516098): 763-76910.1038/nn.2821Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). VNO tissue lysates from WT, ΔAno1olf, ΔAno2, or Δ(Ano1olf/Ano2) animals were analyzed by Western blotting. A sharp band corresponding to a nonglycosylated shortened Ano1 protein (lacking the ∼6 kDa large part encoded by the floxed exon (38Heinze C. Seniuk A. Sokolov M.V. Huebner A.K. Klementowicz A.E.

The remaining upper Ano1 band in ΔAno1olf lysates likely stems from nonneuronal glandular or vascular smooth muscle cells which do not express OMP. A broad band corresponding to glycosylated Ano2 was detected in lysates from WT and ΔAno1olf animals but was absent in ΔAno2 and Δ(Ano1olf/Ano2) lysates (Fig. 3C). Absence of the respective proteins was also seen when staining coronal paraffin sections of the nose from WT and Δ(Ano1olf/Ano2) mice. Whereas Ano1 and Ano2 immunoreactivity was detected in WT mice and co-localized with villin at the microvillar endings of VSNs, it was absent in Δ(Ano1olf/Ano2) animals (Fig. 3D). The antibody for Ano1 showed some unspecific staining in VSN cell bodies that persisted in the ΔAno1olf. Expression and localization of villin was not changed in Δ(Ano1olf/Ano2) VNOs, indicating that microvilli of VSN dendritic knobs are intact. Moreover, gross morphological differences concerning the size, shape, and integrity of the VNO layers, as well as changed expression of VNO marker proteins such as ezrin, TRPC2, Gαo, and phosphodiesterase type 4A (PDE4A) could not be observed in Δ(Ano1olf/Ano2) animals (Fig. 3D and Fig. S3C). Ca2+-activated Cl− currents of VSNs were examined in acute slices of the VNO by patching somata in the whole-cell voltage clamp configuration. Recordings with 1.5 μm free [Ca2+] in the pipette revealed robust outwardly rectifying steady-state ICl(Ca) (with 94.8 ± 15.9 pA/pF at +120 mV (mean ± S.E.)) that exhibited slow voltage-dependent activation at positive potentials in most cells (Fig. 4, A and B). As expected, these currents were absent in Δ(Ano1olf/Ano2) VSNs (Fig. 4A), even when pipette [Ca2+] was increased to 13 μm (Fig. 4B). Surprisingly, also VSNs deficient in only Ano1 lacked ICl(Ca) (Fig. 4, A and C), whereas ΔAno2 VSNs showed currents with amplitude, rectification and kinetics comparable with those of WT cells (Fig. 4, A and D, and Fig. S4). Similar results were found when analyzing ICl(Ca) tail currents (Fig. S4). These results indicate that Ano1 carries the bulk of ICl(Ca) in sensory neurons of the VNO. To assess the hypothesis that CaCCs amplify the initial TRPC2-mediated inward current (2Chamero P. Leinders-Zufall T. Zufall F.

In WT mice 35 of 123 cells (28.5%, 13 mice) showed spontaneous spiking within the baseline observation period of 35 s. However, only 15 of 106 VSNs lacking Ano1 and Ano2 (14.2%, 10 mice) showed spontaneous action potential firing (Fig. 5A, left panel). Next, we examined stimulus-evoked spiking by applying diluted urine of male mice (pooled from 7 male mice, 1:200 in bath solution) to the microvilli of some of the measured VSNs. In WT animals, 20 of 82 VSNs (24.4%) showed an increase in the action potential firing rate upon urine application.

Patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) perform poorly in tasks that rely on the successful rearrangement of working memory representations. We hypothesized that serial ordering is impaired in nondemented patients with mild PD. We recruited 49 patients with mild idiopathic PD (Hoehn and Yahr Scale 1-2.5) and 51 matched healthy adults. Nineteen patients had normal global cognition (PD-NC, Montreal Cognitive Assessment, MoCA≥26/30) and thirty patients had mild cognitive impairment (PD-MCI, 21≤MoCA≤25). All participants underwent three working memory assessments: two experimental tests that require reordering random digits following a particular rule (adaptive digit ordering test and digit span backward test) and a control test that requires maintaining but no reordering (digit span forward test). PD-NC and PD-MCI patients performed significantly worse (with lower test scores and larger ordering costs) than healthy controls in both digit ordering and backward tests, although they performed normally in the forward test. The ordering cost increased as a function of age across groups, indicating an aging-related decline in the ability of serial ordering. However, individual patients' task performances were not correlated with their severity or duration of motor symptoms, or daily exposure to dopaminergic drugs. These results suggested that serial ordering deficits exist in early stages of PD, prior to subtle changes in global cognition and in parallel with motor symptoms."

Recently, a derivative of the fungal metabolite balanol, N46, has been reported to inhibit PKG Iα with high potency and selectivity and attenuate thermal hyperalgesia and osteoarthritic pain. Here we determined co-crystal structures of the PKG Iα C-domain and cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) Cα, each bound with N46, at 1.98 Å and 2.65 Å, respectively. N46 binds the active site with its external phenyl ring, specifically interacting with the glycine-rich loop and the αC helix. Phe-371 at the PKG Iα glycine-rich loop is oriented parallel to the phenyl ring of N46, forming a strong π-stacking interaction, whereas the analogous Phe-54 in PKA Cα rotates 30° and forms a weaker interaction. Structural comparison revealed that steric hindrance between the preceding Ser-53 and the propoxy group of the phenyl ring may explain the weaker interaction with PKA Cα. The analogous Gly-370 in PKG Iα, however, causes little steric hindrance with Phe-371. Moreover, Ile-406 on the αC helix forms a hydrophobic interaction with N46 whereas its counterpart in PKA, Thr-88, does not. Substituting these residues in PKG Iα with those in PKA Cα increases the IC50 values for N46, whereas replacing these residues in PKA Cα with those in PKG Iα reduces the IC50, consistent with our structural findings. In conclusion, our results explain the structural basis for N46-mediated selective inhibition of human PKG Iα and provide a starting point for structure-guided design of selective PKG Iα inhibitors.

In particular, the PKG Iα C-domain shows 45% sequence identity with the PKA Cα, consistent with their similar structures. The C-domain includes small and large lobes that consist of mostly β strands and α helices, respectively. A highly acidic active site is formed between the two lobes that binds Mg2+, ATP, and substrates. In the absence of cGMP, the activity of PKG Iα is negatively regulated by the interaction between the R- and C-domains (21.Alverdi V. Mazon H. Versluis C. Hemrika W. Esposito G. van den Heuvel R.

The first class is the R-diastereomer of the phosphorothioate analogs of cGMP, including Rp-cGMPS (25.Butt E. van Bemmelen M. Fischer L. Walter U. Jastorff B.

The third class includes peptide inhibitors that also bind the active site and prevent substrate binding. However, all of these inhibitors lack potency, specificity, and activity in vivo. For example, Rp-cGMPS is not potent (Ki = 20 μm) and nonselectively inhibits other cyclic nucleotide effectors, such as phosphodiesterase and PKA (23.Butt E. Schmidt H.H.H.W. Hofmann F.

As mentioned, balanol is a potent inhibitor of PKG but also inhibits other serine and threonine kinases such as PKA, most PKC isoforms, and Ca2+-dependent protein kinase (30.Setyawan J. Koide K.

To improve inhibitor selectivity for PKG Iα, a homology model of PKG Iα docked with balanol was generated based on the crystal structure of the PKA Cα–balanol complex. Several amino acid differences near their binding pockets were identified, and balanol was modified to preferentially interact with PKG Iα–specific residues (18.Sung Y.J. Sofoluke N. Nkamany M. Deng S. Xie Y. Greenwood J. Farid R. Landry D.W. Ambron R.T.

In particular, the homology model showed that Thr-88 of PKA Cα corresponds to Ile-406 in PKG Iα (16.Sung Y.J. Chiu D.T. Ambron R.T. Activation and retrograde transport of protein kinase G in rat nociceptive neurons after nerve injury and inflammation.Neuroscience. 2006; 141 (16730916): 697-70910.1016/j.neuroscience.2006.04.033Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). To exploit this difference, a propoxy group was added to the external phenyl ring (ring D) of the balanol derivatives to selectively interact with Ile-406 of PKG Iα. Although one such compound, N46, was reported to have a high selectivity and potency for PKG Iα over PKA Cα, the exact molecular basis of its improved affinity and specificity is unknown. Several crystal structures have been solved for mammalian PKG I, but these are of various fragments of the R-domains (36.Osborne B.W. Wu J. McFarland C.J. Nickl C.K. Sankaran B. Casteel D.E.

To understand the molecular basis of N46's high selectivity for human PKG Iα, we determined co-crystal structures of N46 bound to the human PKG Iα C-domain and human PKA Cα at 1.98 Å and 2.65 Å, respectively (Fig. 1 and Fig. S1 and Table S1). The PKG Iα C–N46 complex was crystallized in the P42 space group with one molecule in the asymmetric unit. The molecule shows clear electron density for the bound N46 and the C-domain used for crystallization, excluding the first 10 residues at the N terminus (Fig. 1B). The PKA Cα–N46 complex was crystallized in the P3121 space group with one molecule in the asymmetric unit (Fig. 1C and Fig. S1). The final model shows clear density for the Cα subunit except for the first 10 residues. Unlike previous PKA Cα structures, the N-terminal αA helix disengages from the catalytic core because of unusual crystal packing interactions (Fig. S2). The αA helix of a neighboring symmetry mate occupies the equivalent position seen in previous structures and provides the same set of interactions with the catalytic core. The overall structure of the PKG Iα C–N46 complex is similar to the AMP-PNP-bound structure. 4L. Qin, B. Sankaran, D. E. Casteel, and C. Kim, unpublished data. It shows a closed conformation with the fully ordered glycine-rich loop and C-terminal tail (Fig. 1B). N46 binds to a pocket that extends from the hinge region to the inner surface of the αC helix and spans ∼20 Å (Fig. 2A). The pocket can be divided into three subsites according to the interaction between the PKG Iα C-domain and AMP-PNP: the adenine, the ribose, and the extended triphosphate subsites. N46 binds to all three subsites in the extended active site of the PKG Iα C-domain (Fig. 2A). The A-ring (indazole ring) binds the adenine subsite consisting of the hinge (loop between β5-αD) and hydrophobic residues from both small and large lobes (Fig. 2B). Specifically, the protonated 1-N binds the backbone carbonyl of Glu-439, whereas the unprotonated 2-N interacts with the backbone amide of Cys-441 through hydrogen bonds. Additionally, the indazole ring is surrounded by several hydrophobic residues that coat the adenine subsite. These residues include Leu-366, Val-374, Ala-388, Val-422, Met-438, Ile-491, Val-501, and Phe-649. The B-ring (pyrrolidine ring), which connects the A-ring to the C-ring, interacts with the acidic ribose subsite directly and indirectly through water molecules (Fig. 2B). The ribose subsite consists of the hinge and activation loop residues. The side chains of Glu-445 at the hinge and Asp-502 at the activation loop form hydrogen bonds with the amine groups on either side. Two water molecules bridge the interaction with N46 at this subsite. These water molecules are located adjacent to the amide connecting the B-ring to the A-ring, bridging them to the side chains of Glu-445 and Asp-502 through hydrogen bonds. The C-ring (phenyl ring) interacts with β1 and the glycine-rich loop through van der Waals (VDW) contacts (Fig. 2B). In particular, Val-368, Gly-369, and Gly-370 are within 3.4–3.8 Å from the C-ring, providing VDW interactions. Because these interactions are through backbone atoms, this region does not provide any PKG-selective contacts. The D-ring (external phenyl ring) with the propoxy and methoxy groups provides two interactions that are PKG-specific and may explain its high selectivity for PKG Iα over PKA Cα (Fig. 2B). In designing N46, the propoxy group was added to the phenyl ring to provide a preferential interaction with Ile-406 of PKG Iα over PKA Cα, which has a threonine (Thr-88) at the analogous position (Fig. S3) (18.Sung Y.J. Sofoluke N. Nkamany M. Deng S. Xie Y. Greenwood J. Farid R. Landry D.W. Ambron R.T. A novel inhibitor of active protein kinase G attenuates chronic inflammatory and osteoarthritic pain.Pain. 2017; 158 (28059868): 822-83210.1097/j.pain.0000000000000832Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). However, the structure shows that the methoxy group points toward the side chain of Ile-406 instead, whereas the propoxy group points toward the glycine-rich loop, each providing hydrophobic interactions. Additionally, the D-ring, along with the carbonyl group that connects the D-ring to the C-ring, docks to the tip of the glycine-rich loop through hydrogen bonds and VDW interactions. The interconnecting carbonyl group hydrogen bonds with the backbone amide of Phe-371 and uniquely forms a lone pair–π interaction with its side chain. The D-ring and the side chain of Phe-371 are off-centered, and they interact through a parallel displaced π interaction. The overall interactions between the PKA Cα subunit and N46 are similar to those in the PKG Iα C–N46 complex because most of the contact residues are highly conserved between the two kinases (Fig. 3A). However, the structure shows differences that may explain a higher IC50 value for the PKA Cα subunit. The A-ring binds the adenine subsite, and the interactions in this region are essentially the same as in PKG Iα. These include hydrogen bonds between the A-ring and the backbone atoms of Glu-121 and Val-123 at the hinge and VDW contacts with a hydrophobic pocket consisting of Leu-49, Val-57, Ala-70, Val-104, Met-120, Leu-173, and Phe-327 (Fig. 3B). Tyr-122 at the hinge region provides an additional hydrophobic contact unseen in PKG Iα because Tyr-122 replaces Ala-440 of PKG Iα. Although the B-ring similarly docks onto the ribose subsite, its amine group interacts only with the hinge residue Glu-127 through a hydrogen bond, not with the activation loop residue Asp-184 (Fig. 3B). Unlike Asp-502 of PKG I, which forms a hydrogen bond with N46 (Fig. 2B), the side chain of Asp-184 points away and no longer interacts with N46 in PKA. The C-ring similarly docks to β1 and the glycine rich loop and interacts with the backbone atoms of Thr-51, Gly-52, and Ser-53. The D-ring interacts less strongly with PKA Cα compared with PKG Iα because of two PKA-specific residues, Phe-54 and Thr-88 (Fig. 3B). The structure shows that the side chain of Phe-54 at the tip of the glycine-rich loop rotates ∼30° and provides a weaker T-shaped π interaction with the D-ring. Because of this rotation, the interconnecting carbonyl no longer forms a lone pair–π interaction with the aromatic Phe-54. In addition, the side chain of Thr-88 of the αC helix is smaller and less hydrophobic than that of Ile-406 of PKG Iα, thus providing a much weaker hydrophobic interaction with the methoxy group (3.7 Å) (Fig. 3B). The structural alignment with the PKG Iα C–N46 complex suggests that a steric clash between the side chain of the preceding residue, Ser-53, and the propoxy moiety causes the rotation of the Phe-54 side chain. As seen in Fig. S3, N46 moves away slightly from the active site because of the steric clash. This allows more room between the D-ring and the glycine-rich loop, causing the rotation of the Phe-54 side chain. The reported inhibition constant of balanol for PKA Cα is 1.6 nm, whereas N46 inhibits PKA with an IC50 of 1.0 μm, showing an over 600-fold increase (18.Sung Y.J. Sofoluke N. Nkamany M. Deng S. Xie Y. Greenwood J. Farid R. Landry D.W. Ambron R.T. A novel inhibitor of active protein kinase G attenuates chronic inflammatory and osteoarthritic pain.Pain. 2017; 158 (28059868): 822-83210.1097/j.pain.0000000000000832Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Comparing the PKA Cα–N46 complex with the PKA Cα–balanol complex reveals that this reduction is mostly due to loss of hydrogen bonds (Fig. 4). The PKA Cα–balanol complex shows 12 nonsolvent mediated hydrogen bonds and large numbers of VDW interactions between the extended active site and balanol. The PKA Cα–N46 complex shows that, although the most of the VDW contacts are preserved, N46 forms only 6 direct hydrogen bonds because of the modifications on the C and D rings. Substituting the phenol of balanol (Fig. 4A, ring a) with the indazole ring of N46 (Fig. 4B, ring A) does not reduce the number of hydrogen bonds and VDW contacts with the adenine subsite. In the PKA–balanol complex, the phenol forms hydrogen bonds with the same backbone atoms of Glu-121 and Val-123 at the hinge region (Fig. 4A) as the indazole. However, replacing a more puckered azepane ring of balanol (Fig. 4A, ring b) with a less puckered pyrrolidine of N46 (Fig. 4B, ring B) results in one additional hydrogen bond at the ribose subsite. The puckered azepane ring interacts mainly with a conserved catalytic loop residue, Glu-170, through its backbone (Fig. 4A). In the PKA–N46 complex, the less puckered pyrrolidine ring brings its amine group within a hydrogen bonding distance of the Glu-127 side chain, forming a new hydrogen bond (Fig. 4B). Removing two hydroxyl groups from the c-ring of balanol (Fig. 4A) disrupts all four hydrogen bonds with the triphosphate subsite. In the PKA Cα–balanol complex, two hydroxyl groups on the c-ring interact with Gly-55, Lys-72, and Asp-184 through four hydrogen bonds. In major contrast, the C-ring of N46 (Fig. 4B) no longer binds these residues and interacts with the glycine-rich loop through VDW contacts. Last, substituting a carboxyl group and a hydroxyl group on the d-ring of balanol (Fig. 4A) with a bulky and hydrophobic propoxy group and a fluorine atom, respectively (Fig. 4B, ring D of N46), significantly weakened the interaction with the glycine-rich loop and the αC helix. In the PKA–balanol complex, the carboxyl group on the d-ring forms strong hydrogen bonds with both the side chain and backbone of Ser-53 at the glycine-rich loop, whereas the 3-hydroxyl group binds the side chains of Glu-91 and Lys-72 through hydrogen bonds. Additionally, the d-ring is oriented parallel to the side chain of Phe-54, allowing a parallel π-stacking interaction between them as well as a lone pair–π interaction between the carbonyl group and Phe-54. None of these interactions are preserved in the PKA–N46 complex, although a new hydrogen bond forms between the propoxy group and the backbone amide of Ser-53. We noticed that the side chain of Phe-54 remains parallel to the d-ring when bound to balanol and rotates when bound to N46 (35.Narayana N. Diller T.C. Koide K. Bunnage M.E. Nicolaou K.C.

https://openalex.org/W2803487872,"Particle separation in microfluidic devices is a common problematic for sample preparation in biology. Deterministic lateral displacement (DLD) is efficiently implemented as a size-based fractionation technique to separate two populations of particles around a specific size. However, real biological samples contain components of many different sizes and a single DLD separation step is not sufficient to purify these complex samples. When connecting several DLD modules in series, pressure balancing at the DLD outlets of each step becomes critical to ensure an optimal separation efficiency. A generic microfluidic platform is presented in this paper to optimize pressure balancing, when DLD separation is connected either to another DLD module or to a different microfluidic function. This is made possible by generating droplets at T-junctions connected to the DLD outlets. Droplets act as pressure controllers, which perform at the same time the encapsulation of DLD sorted particles and the balance of output pressures. The optimized pressures to apply on DLD modules and on T-junctions are determined by a general model that ensures the equilibrium of the entire platform. The proposed separation platform is completely modular and reconfigurable since the same predictive model applies to any cascaded DLD modules of the droplet-based cartridge."
https://openalex.org/W2802263907,"Prolonged sitting and low activity-both common in older people-are associated with increased mortality and poorer health. Whether having a more negative attitude to ageing is associated with higher levels of these behaviours is unclear.We investigated the prospective relationship between attitudes to ageing and objectively measured sedentary and walking behaviour.Participants were 271 members of the Lothian Birth Cohort 1936. At age 72 years, participants completed the Attitudes to Ageing Questionnaire which assesses attitudes on three domains-Psychosocial loss, Physical change and Psychological growth. At age 79 years, participants wore an activPAL activity monitor for seven days. The outcome measures were average daily time spent sedentary, number of sit-to-stand transitions, and step count.There were no significant associations between any of the Attitude to Ageing domain scores and time spent sedentary or number of sit-to-stand transitions. In sex-adjusted analysis, having a more positive attitude to ageing as regards Physical change was associated with a slightly higher daily step count, for a SD increment in score, average daily step count was greater by 1.5% (95% CI 0.6%, 2.4%). On further adjustment for potential confounding factors these associations were no longer significant.We found no evidence that attitudes to ageing at age 72 were predictive of sedentary or walking behaviour seven years later. Future studies should examine whether attitudes to ageing are associated with objectively measured walking or sedentary behaviour at the same point in time. The existence of such an association could inform the development of interventions."
https://openalex.org/W2804887043,"Objective By the 1990s it became popular for women to use hormone therapy (HT) to ease menopause symptoms. Bioidentical estrogen and progesterone are supplements whose molecular structures are identical to what is made in the human body, while synthetic supplements are ones whose structures are not. After the Women’s Health Initiative found that the combined use of the synthetics conjugated equine estrogen (CEE) and medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA) increased breast cancer risk, prescriptions for synthetic HT declined considerably. Since then there has been an increased interest in bioidentical HT; today there are a plethora of websites touting their benefits. However, no peer-reviewed articles support these claims. We performed a retrospective study with the objective of verifying the hypothesis that bioidentical HT is associated with decreased breast cancer risk than CEE & MPA. Methods We searched The Northwestern Medicine Enterprise Data Warehouse for women who initiated HT use after age 50. Women who did not take any HT drug after age 50 served as controls. Nine HT protocols were investigated for breast cancer risk. Results Significant results include CEE Alone is associated with decreased breast cancer risk (HR = 0.31), Other Synthetic Estrogen Alone is associated with increased breast cancer risk (HR = 1.49), Bioidentical Estrogen Alone is associated with decreased breast cancer risk(HR = 0.65), CEE & MPA is associated with reduced breast cancer risk (HR = 0.43), and CEE & MPA is associated with reduced breast cancer risk relative to Bioidentical Estrogen & Progesterone (HR = 0.25). Discussion Our results indicate CEE & MPA is superior to bioidentical HT as far as breast cancer risk. Furthermore, this combination is associated with decrease of breast cancer risk, contrary to previous findings. Additional retrospective studies are needed to confirm our results."
https://openalex.org/W2803299386,"The protozoan Trypanosoma brucei sp. cause diseases in humans and animals. Studies of T. brucei cell biology have revealed unique features, such as major endocytic events being limited to a single region, and mitochondrial genome segregation mediated via basal bodies. Further understanding of trypanosome cell biology can be facilitated with super-resolution fluorescence microscopy. Lack of a plasma membrane probe for fixed trypanosomes remains a persistent problem in need of a working solution. Herein, we report protocols developed using mCLING in super-resolution structured illumination fluorescence microscopy (SR-SIM). mCLING comprehensively labels flagellar membranes, including nascent intracellular stages. To extend its usefulness for trypanosome biology we optimized mCLING in combination with organelle-specific antibodies for immunofluorescence of basal bodies or mitochondria. Then in work with live trypanosomes, we demonstrated internalization of mCLING into endocytic stations that overlap with LysoTracker in acidic organelles. Greater detail of the intracellular location of mCLING was obtained with SR-SIM after pulsing trypanosomes with the probe, and allowing continuous uptake of fluorescent concanavalin A (ConA) destined for lysosomes. In most cases, ConA and mCLING vesicles were juxtaposed but not coincident. A video of the complete image stack at the 15 min time point shows zones of mCLING staining surrounding patches of ConA, consistent with persistence of mCLING in membranes of compartments that contain luminal ConA. In summary, these studies establish mCLING as a versatile trypanosome membrane probe compatible with super-resolution microscopy that can be used for detailed analysis of flagellar membrane biogenesis. In addition, mCLING can be used for immunofluorescence in fixed, permeabilized trypanosomes. Its robust staining of the plasma membrane eliminates a need to overlay transmitted light images on fluorescence pictures obtained from widefield, confocal, or super-resolution microscopy."
https://openalex.org/W2803517661,"Purpose Paget disease of the breast is a rare cancer that originates from the nipple–areolar complex. It is often overlooked and misdiagnosed as benign chronic eczema of the nipple. We aimed to retrospectively verify whether blood flow analysis using Doppler sonography was useful for detecting the presence of Paget disease. Methods In this retrospective study, 12 patients with pathologically proven unilateral nipple eczematous lesions (seven with Paget disease and five with simple dermatitis) were included. Nipple blood flow signal was observed using Doppler sonography, and the detected blood flow signals were quantified using digitally recorded images. Quantified blood flow ratio and pathologically examined capillary density were evaluated between affected and unaffected nipples. Findings of mammography, grayscale sonography, and contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (CE-MRI) were reviewed. Results In patients with Paget disease, Doppler effects in the affected nipple were more clearly visible than those in the unaffected nipple. These effects were sufficiently visible to identify Paget disease. No obvious effects were observed in the affected and unaffected nipples of simple dermatitis. The quantified blood flow ratio and pathologically examined capillary density were significantly higher for the Paget lesion than those for the non-Paget lesion. The sensitivity of CE-MRI and Doppler sonography was markedly correlated, revealing blood flow changes in the nipple lesions of Paget disease. Conclusion Doppler sonography visualized the proliferation of blood vessels in Paget lesions. The visualization of increased nipple blood flow using Doppler sonography is a simple and low-cost method that provides useful data for identifying Paget disease during routine medical care."
https://openalex.org/W2803732594,"Splice-switching oligonucleotides (SSOs) that can modulate RNA splicing are used for the treatment of many genetic disorders. To enhance the efficacy of modulating splicing, it is important to optimize SSOs with regard to target sites, GC content, melting temperature (Tm value), chemistries, and lengths. Thus, in vitro assay systems that allow for the rapid and simple screening of SSOs are essential for optimizing SSO design. In this study, we established a novel tri-chromatic reporter cell line for SSO screening. This reporter cell line is designed to express three different fluorescent proteins (blue, green, and red) and was employed for high content screening (HCS, also known as high content analysis; HCA) for the evaluation of SSO-induced exon skipping by analyzing the expression levels of fluorescent proteins. The blue fluorescent protein is stably expressed throughout the cell and is useful for data normalization using cell numbers. Furthermore, both the green and red fluorescent proteins were used for monitoring the splicing patterns of target genes. Indeed, we demonstrated that this novel reporter cell line involving HCS leads to a more rapid and simple approach for the evaluation of exon skipping than widely used methods, such as RT-PCR, western blotting, and quantitative RT-PCR. Additionally, a brief screening of Locked nucleic acids (LNA)-based SSOs targeting exon 51 in DMD was performed using the reporter cell line. The LNA-based SSO cocktail shows high exon 51 skipping in a dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, the LNA-based SSO cocktails display high exon 51 skipping activities on endogenous DMD mRNA in human rhabdomyosarcoma cells."
https://openalex.org/W2803980714,"The present study investigated the prognostic role of adjuvant systemic chemotherapy in patients with node negative, T1c triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) from a nationwide cohort. In addition, the prognostic effect between 3 different chemotherapy regimens were compared in node-negative T1c TNBC patients by subgroup analysis.From the Korean breast cancer registry database, 1,151 T1c node negative TNBC patients were included in this study. Patients were categorized into four treatment groups according to chemotherapy regimen: (1) no chemotherapy, (2) adriamycin plus cyclophosphamide (AC), (3) adriamycin/epirubicin plus cyclophosphamide plus 5-FU (FAC/FEC), and (4) cyclophosphamide plus 5-FU plus methotrexate (CMF). Overall survival (OS) was evaluated between each patient group.Of the 1,151 T1c node negative TNBC patients, 1,006 received adjuvant chemotherapy, while 145 received no chemotherapy. Among the patients receiving adjuvant chemotherapy the distribution of regimens was: 586 AC, 168 FAC/FEC (126 FAC, 42 FEC), and 252 CMF. The mean follow-up time of the full study cohort was 87.98 ± 33.56 months (range = 6-192 months). Patients in the no chemotherapy group showed significantly worse OS compared to each chemotherapy regimen group. However, when OS was compared between each chemotherapy regimen, no significant difference was found.This study showed that adjuvant systemic chemotherapy improved OS in T1c node negative TNBC patients, regardless of chemotherapy between AC, FAC/FEC, and CMF regimens."

Using an optimization and a Bernoulli process model, we solved for the optimal CDC prevention budget allocation for each health department group. The optimal allocation distributed the funds across prevention interventions and populations at risk for HIV to prevent the greatest number of new HIV cases annually.Both the HIV prevention interventions funded by the optimal allocation of CDC HIV prevention funds and the proportions of the budget allocated were similar across health department groups, particularly those representing the large majority of PLWDH. Consistently funded interventions included testing, partner services and linkage to care and interventions for men who have sex with men (MSM). Sensitivity analyses showed that the optimal allocation shifted when there were differences in transmission category proportions and progress along the HIV care continuum.The robustness of the results suggests that most health departments can use these analyses to guide the investment of CDC HIV prevention funds into strategies to prevent the most new cases of HIV."
https://openalex.org/W2804549834,"Research on familiar faces has recurrently been conducted in different domains, such as, psycholinguistics, memory, attention, face processing, aging studies, etc. In general, photographs of celebrities, their proper names, or their occupations have been the materials mainly employed in those types of studies. These stimuli are, however, very constrained by the geographic and sociocultural contexts in which the studies are conducted, and, in spite of their relevance for psychological research, there are no normative studies for celebrities in Spain. With the aim of filling this gap, the photographs and names of the 118 most frequently produced celebrities in Spain were collected. For each celebrity, values for 13 different indices (including psycholinguistic properties, naming times, and emotional indicators) were obtained from a young adult Spanish sample. Regression analyses on the data indicated that the main determinant in naming times and ToTs was the percentage of correct responses. Face agreement was also a significant predictor of ToTs. Results were compared with previous celebrity norms in other languages, and discussed in relation to the current models of face processing. These norms are likely to make a useful contribution to the design of more controlled research and applied tools in Psychology."
https://openalex.org/W2803670094,"Chloroplasts host photosynthesis and fulfill other metabolic functions that are essential to plant life. They have to divide by binary fission to maintain their numbers throughout cycles of cell division. Chloroplast division is achieved by a complex ring-shaped division machinery located on both the inner (stromal) and the outer (cytosolic) side of the chloroplast envelope. The inner division ring (termed the Z ring) is formed by the assembly of tubulin-like FtsZ1 and FtsZ2 proteins. ARC6 is a key chloroplast division protein that interacts with the Z ring. ARC6 spans the inner envelope membrane, is known to stabilize or maintain the Z ring, and anchors the Z ring to the inner membrane through interaction with FtsZ2. The underlying mechanism of Z ring stabilization is not well-understood. Here, biochemical and structural characterization of ARC6 was conducted using light scattering, sedimentation, and light and transmission EM. The recombinant protein was purified as a dimer. The results indicated that a truncated form of ARC6 (tARC6), representing the stromal portion of ARC6, affects FtsZ2 assembly without forming higher-order structures and exerts its effect via FtsZ2 dynamics. tARC6 prevented GDP-induced FtsZ2 disassembly and caused a significant net increase in FtsZ2 assembly when GDP was present. Single particle analysis and 3D reconstruction were performed to elucidate the structural basis of ARC6 activity. Together, the data reveal that a dimeric form of tARC6 binds to FtsZ2 filaments and does not increase FtsZ polymerization rates but rather inhibits GDP-associated FtsZ2 disassembly."
https://openalex.org/W2803896091,"Savanna ecosystems are popular subjects for interaction studies. Multiple studies have been done on the impact of elephants on vegetation, the impact of grass and browse availability on animal densities or on competition between herbivore species. Previous studies showed that elephant densities are frequently negatively correlated with densities of tall trees, and that browse and grass availability are correlated with browser and grazer density respectively. Additionally, a competition effect between browse and grass availability has been reported. These relationships are usually analysed by testing direct relationships between e.g., herbivore densities and food availability, without addressing competition effects or other indirect effects. In this study, multiple interactions in a savanna system have been analysed simultaneously using Partial Least Square-Path Modelling (PLS-PM) using mammal and vegetation data from three different wildlife reserves in southern KwaZulu-Natal. The results showed that the processes that three separate models for the three areas provided the best understanding of the importance of the different interactions. These models suggest that elephants had a negative impact on trees, but also on grass availability. The impact is stronger when elephants are not able to migrate during the dry season. Browsers and grazers were correlated with browse and grass availability, but competition between browse and grass was not detected. This study shows that due to the complexity of the interactions in an ecosystem and differences in environmental factors, these interactions are best studied per area. PLS-PM can be a useful tool for estimating direct, indirect, and cascading effects of changing animal densities in conservation areas."
https://openalex.org/W2804924836,"Pancreatic lineage-specific transcription factors (TFs) display instructive roles in converting adult cells to endocrine pancreatic cells through a process known as transdifferentiation. However, little is known about potential factors capable of accelerating transdifferentiation following transduction to achieve the functional maturation of transdifferentiated cells. In this study, we demonstrated, using adult liver-derived progenitor cells, that soluble factors utilized in pancreatic differentiation protocols of pluripotent stem cells promote functional maturation of TFs-mediated transdifferentiated cells. Treatment with an N2 supplement in combination with three soluble factors (glucagon-like peptide-1 [GLP-1] receptor agonist, notch inhibitor, and transforming growth factor-β [TGF-β] inhibitor) enhanced liver-to-pancreas transdifferentiation based on the following findings: i) the incidence of c-peptide-positive cells increased by approximately 1.2-fold after the aforementioned treatment; ii) the c-peptide expression level in the treated cells increased by approximately 12-fold as compared with the level in the untreated cells; iii) the treated cells secreted insulin in a glucose-dependent manner, whereas the untreated cells did not; and iv) transplantation of treated-transdifferentiated cells into streptozotocin-induced immunodeficient diabetic mice led to the amelioration of hyperglycemia. These results suggest that treatment with specific soluble factors promotes the functional maturation of transdifferentiated cells. Our findings could facilitate the development of new modalities for cell-replacement therapy for patients with diabetes."
https://openalex.org/W2804314549,"The consequences of apoptosis extend beyond the mere death of the cell. We have shown that receptor-mediated recognition of apoptotic target cells by viable kidney proximal tubular epithelial cells (PTECs) inhibits PTEC proliferation, growth, and survival. Here, we tested the hypothesis that continual exposure to apoptotic targets can induce a phenotypic change in responding PTECs, as in other instances of natural selection. In particular, we demonstrate that repeated exposure to apoptotic targets leads to emergence of a PTEC line (denoted BU.MPTSEL) resistant to apoptotic target–induced death. Resistance is exquisitely specific. Not only are BU.MPTSEL responders fully resistant to apoptotic target–induced death (∼85% survival versus <10% survival of nonselected cells) but do so while retaining sensitivity to all other target-induced responses, including inhibition of proliferation and growth. Moreover, the resistance of BU.MPTSEL responders is specific to target-induced apoptosis, as apoptosis in response to other suicidal stimuli occurs normally. Comparison of the signaling events induced by apoptotic target exposure in selected versus nonselected responders indicated that the acquired resistance of BU.MPTSEL cells lies in a regulatory step affecting the generation of the pro-apoptotic protein, truncated BH3 interacting–domain death agonist (tBID), most likely at the level of BID cleavage by caspase-8. This specific adaptation has especial relevance for cancer, in which the prominence and persistence of cell death entail magnification of the post-mortem effects of apoptotic cells. Just as cancer cells acquire specific resistance to chemotherapeutic agents, we propose that cancer cells may also adapt to their ongoing exposure to apoptotic targets.

We surveyed internal medicine (IM) residents with an objective of classifying knowledge of and confidence in using the American Society of Hematology (ASH) CW principles in hemostasis, thrombosis, and non-malignant hematology. Methods Multi-institutional study of IM residents at 5 academic training programs in the United States. A 10-question, case-based multiple choice test, with each question accompanied by a 5-point Likert-scale confidence assessment, was distributed electronically. Responses were summarized with frequencies and percentages or medians and ranges, as appropriate. Two sample t-tests or Wilcoxon rank-sum tests were used to compare confidence and knowledge scores. Results Of 892 IM residents, 174 (19.5%) responded to all questions. Overall, residents answered a median of 7 of 10 questions correctly (range 2–10) and median resident confidence in their responses was 3.1 (on a 5-point scale). Correct responses were significantly associated with higher confidence for all but one question. Having a hematology rotation experience was significantly associated with more correct responses and with higher confidence (p = 0.001 and p<0.001, respectively). Conclusions IM residents at several academic hospitals have variable knowledge of ASH-CW guidelines in thrombosis and hemostasis/non-malignant hematology. Residents who have done hematology rotations, particularly a hematology consult rotation, were more likely to answer questions correctly and to be more confident that their answers were correct. Adequate clinical exposure and training in cost-effective care is essential to train clinicians who are cost-conscious in any specialty."

Closely related sister species living in direct proximity without alteration in feeding habit would be in direct violation of Lotka-Volterra dynamics. These two species were measured and compared to see if any evidence of differentiation along feeding lines has occurred in order to reduce direct competition. P-values obtained via Student's t test display significant differentiation across all measured parameters. Thin-plate splines were used to visualize these differences, and clearly show the differences which are focused on the ambulacral region of the blastoids, which are the primary food gathering point for these species."
https://openalex.org/W2803954979,"Contemporary rodent models for bipolar disorders split the bipolar spectrum into complimentary behavioral endophenotypes representing mania and depression. Widely accepted mania models typically utilize single gene transgenics or pharmacological manipulations, but inbred rodent strains show great potential as mania models. Their acceptance is often limited by the lack of genotypic data needed to establish construct validity. In this study, we used a unique strategy to inexpensively explore and confirm population allele differences in naturally occurring candidate variants in a manic rodent strain, the Madison (MSN) mouse strain. Variants were identified using whole exome resequencing on a small population of animals. Interesting candidate variants were confirmed in a larger population with genotyping. We enriched these results with observations of locomotor behavior from a previous study. Resequencing identified 447 structural variants that are mostly fixed in the MSN strain relative to control strains. After filtering and annotation, we found 11 non-synonymous MSN variants that we believe alter protein function. The allele frequencies for 6 of these variants were consistent with explanatory variants for the Madison strain's phenotype. The variants are in the Npas2, Cp, Polr3c, Smarca4, Trpv1, and Slc5a7 genes, and many of these genes' products are in pathways implicated in human bipolar disorders. Variants in Smarca4 and Polr3c together explained over 40% of the variance in locomotor behavior in the Hsd:ICR founder strain. These results enhance the MSN strain's construct validity and implicate altered nucleosome structure and transcriptional regulation as a chief molecular system underpinning behavior."
