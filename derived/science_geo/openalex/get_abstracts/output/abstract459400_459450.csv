https://openalex.org/W2015758704,"PINK1 and PARKIN are causal genes for autosomal recessive familial Parkinsonism. PINK1 is a mitochondrial Ser/Thr kinase, whereas Parkin functions as an E3 ubiquitin ligase. Under steady-state conditions, Parkin localizes to the cytoplasm where its E3 activity is repressed. A decrease in mitochondrial membrane potential triggers Parkin E3 activity and recruits it to depolarized mitochondria for ubiquitylation of mitochondrial substrates. The molecular basis for how the E3 activity of Parkin is re-established by mitochondrial damage has yet to be determined. Here we provide in vitro biochemical evidence for ubiquitin-thioester formation on Cys-431 of recombinant Parkin. We also report that Parkin forms a ubiquitin-ester following a decrease in mitochondrial membrane potential in cells, and that this event is essential for substrate ubiquitylation. Importantly, the Parkin RING2 domain acts as a transthiolation or acyl-transferring domain rather than an E2-recruiting domain. Furthermore, formation of the ubiquitin-ester depends on PINK1 phosphorylation of Parkin Ser-65. A phosphorylation-deficient mutation completely inhibited formation of the Parkin ubiquitin-ester intermediate, whereas phosphorylation mimics, such as Ser to Glu substitution, enabled partial formation of the intermediate irrespective of Ser-65 phosphorylation. We propose that PINK1-dependent phosphorylation of Parkin leads to the ubiquitin-ester transfer reaction of the RING2 domain, and that this is an essential step in Parkin activation."
https://openalex.org/W2063423463,"Epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) is a major polyphenol in green tea that has beneficial effects in the prevention of cardiovascular disease. Autophagy is a cellular process that protects cells from stressful conditions. To determine whether the beneficial effect of EGCG is mediated by a mechanism involving autophagy, the roles of the EGCG-stimulated autophagy in the context of ectopic lipid accumulation were investigated. Treatment with EGCG increased formation of LC3-II and autophagosomes in primary bovine aortic endothelial cells (BAEC). Activation of calmodulin-dependent protein kinase kinase β was required for EGCG-induced LC3-II formation, as evidenced by the fact that EGCG-induced LC3-II formation was significantly impaired by knockdown of calmodulin-dependent protein kinase kinase β. This effect is most likely due to cytosolic Ca(2+) load. To determine whether EGCG affects palmitate-induced lipid accumulation, the effects of EGCG on autophagic flux and co-localization of lipid droplets and autophagolysosomes were examined. EGCG normalized the palmitate-induced impairment of autophagic flux. Accumulation of lipid droplets by palmitate was markedly reduced by EGCG. Blocking autophagosomal degradation opposed the effect of EGCG in ectopic lipid accumulation, suggesting the action of EGCG is through autophagosomal degradation. The mechanism for this could be due to the increased co-localization of lipid droplets and autophagolysosomes. Co-localization of lipid droplets with LC3 and lysosome was dramatically increased when the cells were treated with EGCG and palmitate compared with the cells treated with palmitate alone. Collectively, these findings suggest that EGCG regulates ectopic lipid accumulation through a facilitated autophagic flux and further imply that EGCG may be a potential therapeutic reagent to prevent cardiovascular complications."
https://openalex.org/W1992213995,"Although a high level of lactate is quintessential to both tumors and wound healing, the manner by which lactate impacts endothelial cells to promote angiogenesis and thereby create or restore vascular perfusion to growing tissues has not been fully elucidated. Here we report that lactate activated the PI3K/Akt pathway in primary human endothelial cells. Furthermore, activating this signaling pathway was required for lactate-stimulated organization of endothelial cells into tubes and for sprouting of vessels from mouse aortic explants. Lactate engaged the PI3K/Akt pathway via ligand-mediated activation of the three receptor tyrosine kinases Axl, Tie2, and VEGF receptor 2. Neutralizing the ligands for these receptor tyrosine kinases, pharmacologically inhibiting their kinase activity or suppressing their expression largely eliminated the ability of cells and explants to respond to lactate. Elucidating the mechanism by which lactate communicates with endothelial cells presents a previously unappreciated opportunity to improve our understanding of the angiogenic program and to govern it."
https://openalex.org/W2076225033,"Breast cancer is one of the most common malignancies in human females in the world. One protein that has elevated enzymatic lipase activity in breast cancers in vitro is phospholipase D (PLD), which is also involved in cell migration. We demonstrate that the PLD2 isoform, which was analyzed directly in the tumors, is crucial for cell invasion that contributes critically to the growth and development of breast tumors and lung metastases in vivo. We used three complementary strategies in a SCID mouse model and also addressed the underlying molecular mechanism. First, the PLD2 gene was silenced in highly metastatic, aggressive breast cancer cells (MDA-MB-231) with lentivirus-based short hairpin RNA, which were xenotransplanted in SCID mice. The resulting mouse primary mammary tumors were reduced in size (65%, P<0.05) and their onset delayed when compared with control tumors. Second, we stably overexpressed PLD2 in low-invasive breast cancer cells (MCF-7) with a biscistronic MIEG retroviral vector and observed that these cells were converted into a highly aggressive phenotype, as primary tumors that formed following xenotransplantation were larger, grew faster and developed lung metastases more readily. Third, we implanted osmotic pumps into SCID xenotransplanted mice that delivered two different small-molecule inhibitors of PLD activity (5-fluoro-2-indolyl des-chlorohalopemide and N-[2-(4-oxo-1-phenyl-1,3,8-triazaspiro[4,5]dec-8-yl)ethyl]-2-naphthalenecarboxamide). These inhibitors led to significant (>70%, P<0.05) inhibition of primary tumor growth, metastatic axillary tumors and lung metastases. In order to define the underlying mechanism, we determined that the machinery of PLD-induced cell invasion is mediated by phosphatidic acid, Wiscott-Aldrich Syndrome protein, growth receptor-bound protein 2 and Rac2 signaling events that ultimately affect actin polymerization and cell invasion. In summary, this study shows for the first time that PLD2 has a central role in the development, metastasis and level of aggressiveness of breast cancer, raising the possibility that PLD2 could be used as a new therapeutic target."
https://openalex.org/W2089647000,"Human noroviruses are the most common cause of acute gastroenteritis worldwide. Recently, cell culture systems have been described using either human embryonic intestinal epithelial cells (Int-407) or human epithelial colorectal adenocarcinoma cells (Caco-2) growing on collagen-I porous micro carrier beads in a rotating bioreactor under conditions of physiological fluid shear. Here, we describe the efforts from two independent laboratories to implement this three dimensional (3D) cell culture system for the replication of norovirus. Int-407 and Caco-2 were grown in a rotating bioreactor for up to 28 days. Prior to infection, cells were screened for the presence of microvilli by electron microscopy and stained for junction proteins (zonula occludens-1, claudin-1, and β-catenin). Differentiated 3D cells were transferred to 24-well plates and infected with bacteria-free filtrates of various norovirus genotypes (GI.1, GI.3, GI.8, GII.2, GII.4, GII.7, and GII.8). At 12 h, 24 h, and 48 h post inoculation, viral RNA from both cells and supernatants were collected and analyzed for norovirus RNA by real-time reverse transcription PCR. Despite observations of high expression of junction proteins and microvilli development in stained thin sections, our data suggest no significant increase in viral titer based on norovirus RNA copy number during the first 48 h after inoculation for the different samples and virus culture conditions tested. Our combined efforts demonstrate that 3D cell culture models using Int-407 or Caco-2 cells do not support norovirus replication and highlight the complexity and difficulty of developing a reproducible in vitro cell culture system for human norovirus."
https://openalex.org/W1993596948,"The paper describes the creation of a new scale to measure intimate partner violence (IPV) among gay and bisexual men.Seven focus group discussions were held with gay and bisexual men, focusing on defining intimate partner violence: 30 forms of IPV were identified. A venue-recruited sample of 912 gay and bisexual men was surveyed, examining definitional understanding and recent experiences of each of the 30 forms of IPV. Participants were also asked questions from the CDC definition of intimate partner violence and the short-form of the Conflicts Tactics Scale (CTS2S). Factor analysis of responses to the definitional questions was used to create the IPV-GBM scale, and the prevalence of intimate partner violence was compared with that identified by the CDC and CTS2S measures of intimate partner violence.A 23-item scale, with 5 unique domains, was created, with strong internal reliability (Cronbach Alpha >.90). The IPV-GBM scale mirrored both the CDC and CTS2S definitions of intimate partner violence, but contained additional domains such as controlling violence, monitoring behaviors, emotional violence, and HIV-related violence. The new scale identified a significantly higher prevalence of IPV than either of the more commonly used measures.The results presented here provide encouraging evidence for a new, more accurate measure of intimate partner violence among gay and bisexual men in the U.S."

LINE-1 (long interspersed element 1) is a non-long terminal repeat (LTR) 4The abbreviation used is: LTRlong terminal repeat. retrotransposon that needs to convert its RNA into DNA to “jump” from one site in the genome to the other. Human genome contains more than 500,000 copies of LINE-1, among which ∼80–100 copies are capable of retrotransposition (1.Brouha B. Schustak J. Badge R.M. Lutz-Prigge S. Farley A.H. Moran J.V.

Of all transposons in human genome including DNA transposons, LTR retrotransposons (also called endogenous retroviruses) and non-LTR retrotransposons (including LINEs and SINEs (short interspersed elements)), LINE-1 is the only active autonomous transposon in human genome. LINE-1 proteins also support the retrotransposition of SINES including Alu and SVA that do not encode their own proteins. The actions of LINE-1, Alu, and SVA cause dozens of genetic diseases (2.Belancio V.P. Hedges D.J. Deininger P. Mammalian non-LTR retrotransposons.

LINE-1 is ∼6,000 nucleotides in length and carries two open reading frames named ORF1 and ORF2, both of which are essential for LINE-1 replication (4.Babushok D.V. Kazazian Jr., H.H. Progress in understanding the biology of the human mutagen LINE-1.Hum. Mutat. 2007; 28: 527-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). ORF1 is a nucleic acid chaperone protein and binds to LINE-1 RNA preferentially in cis (5.Kulpa D.A. Moran J.V. Cis-preferential LINE-1 reverse transcriptase activity in ribonucleoprotein particles.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2006; 13: 655-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). ORF2 has two enzymatic activities: endonuclease and reverse transcriptase (6.Feng Q. Moran J.V. Kazazian Jr., H.H. Boeke J.D.

The endonuclease domain is responsible for recognizing the target sequence (AATTTT) in host genome and generating a nick in one DNA strand. The reverse transcriptase then uses the exposed 3′ OH to prime the reverse transcription of LINE-1 RNA into DNA. This mechanism is named target site-primed reverse transcription (4.Babushok D.V.

LINE-1 transposition poses various deleterious effects on the structure and function of host genome (11.Cordaux R. Batzer M.A. The impact of retrotransposons on human genome evolution.Nat Rev Genet. 2009; 10: 691-703Crossref PubMed Scopus (1088) Google Scholar). For example, LINE-1 can cause insertion, deletion, and recombination of host DNA (2.Belancio V.P. Hedges D.J. Deininger P. Mammalian non-LTR retrotransposons. For better or worse, in sickness and in health.Genome Res. 2008; 18: 343-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). LINE-1 can also modulate the expression of host genes (2.Belancio V.P. Hedges D.J. Deininger P. Mammalian non-LTR retrotransposons. For better or worse, in sickness and in health.Genome Res. 2008; 18: 343-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). Host cells have therefore evolved a number of mechanisms to control LINE-1 replication (12.Zamudio N. Bourc'his D. Transposable elements in the mammalian germline. A comfortable niche or a deadly trap?.Heredity. 2010; 105: 92-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). One strategy involves DNA methylation that silences LINE-1 RNA synthesis. The 5′-UTR of LINE-1 serves as an internal promoter to drive LINE-1 RNA production (13.Swergold G.D. Identification, characterization, and cell specificity of a human LINE-1 promoter.Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 6718-6729Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar). This region contains multiple CpG islands that are subject to methylation, which suppresses LINE-1 transcription (12.Zamudio N.

Indeed, mutation or knock-out of the DNA methyltransferases in mice such as Dnmt1, Dnmt3A, Dnmt3B, and Dnmt3L leads to hypomethylation of LINE-1 and other transposons and concomitantly a high level expression of these elements (15.Kato Y.

One cause for this high LINE-1 activity in embryonic stem cells and germ line cells is the temporal erasure of DNA methylation (22.Hajkova P. Erhardt S. Lane N. Haaf T. El-Maarri O. Reik W. Walter J.

It appears that cells manage to use the same mechanism to protect themselves from either extracellular or intracellular insults that share common biochemical features. One mechanism that was discovered to inhibit one type of virus is often effective against others. This scenario is again manifested on the discovery of the antiviral function of one cellular helicase, Moloney leukemia virus type 10 protein (MOV10). The 110-kDa MOV10 protein was first identified by provirus integration in the Mov10 mouse strain as an ATP-binding protein (35.Mooslehner K. Müller U. Karls U. Hamann L. Harbers K. Structure and expression of a gene encoding a putative GTP-binding protein identified by provirus integration in a transgenic mouse strain.Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 886-893Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and later classified as a member of the superfamily 1 (SF-1) RNA helicase for consisting of seven highly conserved helicase motifs in its C-terminal region (36.Fairman-Williams M.E. Guenther U.P. Jankowsky E. SF1 and SF2 helicases. Family matters.Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2010; 20: 313-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (611) Google Scholar). It is well known that helicases are enzymes that have ATP-dependent DNA or RNA “structure remodeling” activity including classical double-stranded nucleic acid unwinding activity. The two largest helicase groups are superfamilies 1 and 2 (SF-1 and SF-2), which carry seven characteristic motifs (I, Ia, II, III, IV, V, and VI) respectively. Motifs I and II (Walker A and B motifs, respectively) are the fingerprints conserved across the SF-1 and SF-2 helicases. Both motifs that present residues interacting with MgATP/MgADP are essential for ATP binding and ATP hydrolysis (37.Walker J.E. Saraste M. Runswick M.J. Gay N.J. Distantly related sequences in the α- and β-subunits of ATP synthase, myosin, kinases and other ATP-requiring enzymes and a common nucleotide binding fold.EMBO J. 1982; 1: 945-951Crossref PubMed Scopus (4248) Google Scholar). MOV10 was reported being associated with argonaute proteins (38.Meister G. Landthaler M. Peters L. Chen P.Y. Urlaub H. Lührmann R. Tuschl T. Identification of novel argonaute-associated proteins.Curr. Biol. 2005; 15: 2149-2155Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar). This association endows MOV10 with the role of regulating the activity of microRNA machinery (38.Meister G. Landthaler M. Peters L. Chen P.Y. Urlaub H. Lührmann R. Tuschl T. Identification of novel argonaute-associated proteins.Curr. Biol. 2005; 15: 2149-2155Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar). As a result of this function, MOV10 was shown to modulate the synaptic plasticity by suppressing local protein translation at synapses (39.Banerjee S. Neveu P. Kosik K.S. A coordinated local translational control point at the synapse involving relief from silencing and MOV10 degradation.Neuron. 2009; 64: 871-884Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Several lines of evidence implicate that MOV10 also affects a wide range of RNA viruses as a co-factor or restriction factor. For example, MOV10 is required for RNA-directed transcription in hepatitis delta virus (40.Haussecker D. Cao D. Huang Y. Parameswaran P. Fire A.Z. Kay M.A. Capped small RNAs and MOV10 in human hepatitis delta virus replication.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2008; 15: 714-721Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), whereas it inhibits hepatitis C virus replication (41.Schoggins J.W. Wilson S.J. Panis M. Murphy M.Y. Jones C.T. Bieniasz P. Rice C.M. A diverse range of gene products are effectors of the type I interferon antiviral response.Nature. 2011; 472: 481-485Crossref PubMed Scopus (1642) Google Scholar). Recently, several reports have demonstrated that MOV10 inhibits the replication of lentiviruses including human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1). This inhibition depends on the incorporation of MOV10 into HIV-1 particles and the impediment of viral reverse transcription (42.Furtak V. Mulky A. Rawlings S.A. Kozhaya L. Lee K. Kewalramani V.N.

In this study, we report that MOV10 also restricts the mobilization of LINE-1, which further demonstrates MOV10 as an important player in host defense against exogenous and endogenous parasitic genetic elements. CMV-L1-neoRT carries a copy of complete human LINE-1 DNA that bears a neomycin resistance gene as a reporter of LINE-1 retrotransposition (45.Esnault C. Maestre J. Heidmann T. Human LINE retrotransposons generate processed pseudogenes.Nat. Genet. 2000; 24: 363-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (641) Google Scholar). The IAP-neoTNF and MusD-neoTNF plasmids express mouse LTR retrotransposons containing a similar neomycin resistance cassette placed in reverse direction (46.Dewannieux M. Dupressoir A. Harper F.

The neomycin resistance gene is inactive by the presence of a forward intron that is removed during RNA splicing, resulting in a functional gene after reverse transcription and integration. JM101/L1.3 has a full-length human L1.3 element without any inserted reporter (47.Dombroski B.A. Scott A.F. Kazazian Jr., H.H.

The amino acids Lys-531 and Glu-647 were changed to Arg and Gln, respectively, using site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) to create two mutants MOV10 (KR) and MOV10 (EQ). The LINE-1 5′-UTR was amplified from CMV-L1-neoRT using primers 5′-AAACCGCTCGAGGAATAGGAACAGCTC-3′ and 5′-TTTCCCAAGCTTCTTTGTGGTTTTATC-3′. The PCR products were digested with restriction enzymes XhoI and HindIII and then inserted to the 5′ end of firefly luciferase gene in the pGL3-Basic vector (Promega) to create L1-Luc reporter DNA. HEK293 cells or HeLa cells were seeded in 6-well plates 1 day prior to transfection with 750 ng of the CMV-L1-neoRT, IAP-neoTNF, or MusD-neoTNF reporter DNA. Forty hours after transfection, cells were detached from the plates with trypsin and seeded into 6-well plates at serial dilutions. G418 (0.75 mg/ml) was then added to select for resistant cell colonies. Twelve days into selection when cell colonies were clearly visible, the cells were fixed with methanol at room temperature for 10 min and stained with 0.5% crystal violet (in 25% methanol) for 10 min (48.Stetson D.B.

The p values were calculated with Student's t test. HeLa cells were first transfected with 750 ng of the CMV-L1-neoRT, IAP-neoTNF, or MusD-neoTNF reporter DNA with or without the same amount of MOV10 DNA. Seventy-two hours later, total cellular DNA was extracted with the QIAamp DNA mini kit (Qiagen). The same amounts of DNA (250 ng) were subject to PCR using a pair of primers 5′-CAGTTCGGCTGGCGCGAGGCC-3′/5′-CAGTTCCGCCCATTCTCCG-3 (49.Esnault C. Millet J. Schwartz O. Heidmann T. Dual inhibitory effects of APOBEC family proteins on retrotransposition of mammalian endogenous retroviruses.Nucleic Acids Res. 2006; 34: 1522-1531Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). The primer 5′-CAGTTCGGCTGGCGCGAGGCC-3′ crosses the exon/intron junction within the neomycin resistance gene such that only the spliced and reverse transcribed DNA can be amplified. The PCR was performed with the AccuPrime Taq DNA polymerase (Invitrogen) for 25–38 cycles under the following conditions: 94 °C for 50 s, 60 °C for 50 s, and 68 °C for 1 min. The DNA products were separated by electrophoresis in 1% agarose gels and visualized with ethidium bromide staining. HEK293 cells were co-transfected with CMV-L1-neoRT and MOV10-expressing plasmid. An equal amount of total cellular RNA was treated with DNase to remove the potential contamination of plasmid DNA. The random primer was used for reverse transcription. The cDNA products were normalized by the GAPDH. The unspliced form of LINE-1 RNA was detected by PCR using the primer Fneo (5′-AATATCACGGGTAGCCAA-3′) and Rintron (5′-CTGGGGTGGCCTAGCTAAC-3′), whereas the spliced form of LINE-1 RNA was detected by PCR using the primer Fneo and Rneo (5′-GAAGCCGGTCTTGTCGATC-3′). HEK293 cells were transfected with CMV-L1-neoRT, IAP-neoTNF, or MusD-neoTNF reporter DNA. Total cellular RNA was extracted with TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) 40 h after transfection. The same amounts of RNA samples were subject to electrophoresis in 1% denaturing agarose gels. After being transferred onto nylon membranes, RNA was hybridized to 32P-labeled DNA probes that were amplified using primers 5′-CGGATCAAGCGTATGCAGCC-3′/5′-GCAGGTTCTCCGGCCGCTTG-3′ and recognized the neomycin resistance gene sequence. The same probes bind to the RNA of CMV-L1-neoRT, IAP-neoTNF, and MusD-neoTNF. When JM101/L1.3 was used in transfection, a DNA fragment of L1.3 (nucleotide positions 1199–1533; L19088) was labeled with 32P and used as the probes in Northern blotting. After extensive washing, the radioactive signals were exposed to x-ray films. The GAPDH mRNA was detected as the internal control (50.Zhou Y. Ma J. Bushan Roy B. Wu J.Y. Pan Q. Rong L. Liang C.

In brief, total RNA was extracted from HeLa cells with TRIzol reagent, followed by purifying the poly(A) mRNA using the PolyATract mRNA isolation system III kit (Promega). The first strand cDNA was synthesized with the ORF2(−) primer (5′-CTG TGT CTT TTA ATT GCA GAA TTT AGT CC-3′) using an RT-PCR kit (Promega) in accordance with the manufacturer's protocol. This cDNA was then amplified with the forward primer (5′-AAG CTT GAA TTC GGG GGA GGA GCC AAG ATG GCC G-3′) and the nORF2(−) primer (5′-TTA ATT AAT AGT CCA TTT ATA TTT AAA G-3′). The resulted PCR products were used in the second round of PCR that was performed with the nested forward primer (5′-GGA GCC AAG ATG GCC GAA TAG GAA CAG CT-3′) and the nORF2(−) primer. The final PCR products were analyzed by gel electrophoresis. DNA was excised and purified with the QIAquick gel extraction kit (Qiagen), followed by sequencing to confirm the identity as LINE-1 sequence. The endogenous MOV10 protein was knocked down with siRNA oligonucleotides 5′-GAAACCCTGTGGTGACCAA-3′ that target MOV10 mRNA at nucleotide positions 1058–1076 (NM_0011 30079.1) (38.Meister G.

HEK293 cells were seeded into 6-well plates 1 day prior to two sequential transfections of siRNA oligonucleotides (25 nm) using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). The efficiency of siRNA knockdown was assessed by Western blotting using anti-MOV10 (Abcam; ab80613) or anti-Ago2 (Abnova) antibodies. HEK293 cells were co-transfected with CMV-L1-neoRT and the plasmid encoding MOV10. Twenty hours after transfection, the cells were treated with actinomycin D for 0, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, or 8 h, and then the total cellular RNA was extracted and analyzed by Northern blotting using probes specific for LINE-1 and GAPDH, respectively, as described above. HEK293 cells were co-transfected with MOV10 DNA and plasmid encoding Myc-tagged ORF1. The cells were collected 48 h post-transfection and then lysed in 350 μl of TNT buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 200 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100). Insoluble material was pelleted at 1800 × g for 30 min. Equal amounts of supernatant were incubated with 5 μl of MOV10-specific antibody (Abcam; rabbit) or anti-Myc antibody (Abcam; mouse) for 16 h at 4 °C, followed by the addition of protein A-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) for 2 h. The immune-precipitated complex was then washed three times with the TNT buffer and phosphate-buffered saline, followed by Western blot analysis using anti-Myc (mouse) or MOV10-specific antibody, respectively. To detect the possible association of MOV10 with LINE-1 RNA, HEK293 cells were transfected with MOV10 DNA and the CMV-L1-neoRT DNA. The expressed MOV10-FLAG was immune-precipitated with anti-FLAG antibody as described above. The RNA associated with the precipitated complex was extracted with TRIzol agents (Invitrogen) and subjected to RT-PCR using primers that amplify the neo gene as described above. HEK293 cells were seeded in a four-chamber slide 1 day prior to transfection with plasmids expressing FLAG-tagged MOV10, MOV10EQ, or MOV10KR. The cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde (in 1× phosphate-buffered saline) for 10 min at room temperature and permeabilized with 4% paraformaldehyde and 0.1% Triton X-100 for 10 min at room temperature. The cells were then stained for 2 h at room temperature with antibodies against FLAG (1:500 dilution, mouse). After being washed with 1× phosphate-buffered saline, the cells were incubated with either Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated secondary anti-mouse antibody (1:2,000 dilution; Invitrogen). The images were recorded using the Zeiss Pascal laser scanning confocal microscope. To monitor LINE-1 activity, we used in the following experiments a CMV-L1-neoRT reporter construct that has a neomycin resistance gene inserted in the 3′-UTR of LINE-1 in the opposite direction from the LINE-1 coding sequence (Fig. 1A) (45.Esnault C.

https://openalex.org/W1990738741,"Recent studies suggested that cancer stem cells (CSCs) are capable of differentiating into endothelial cells and tumor endothelium may be derived from CSCs. But the mechanism remains unclear. We showed that vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) induced the expression of endothelial markers in breast cancer stem like cells (BCSLCs). In addition, the VEGF-treated BCSLCs formed capillary structure in matrigel and released vWF upon histamine treatment. The miR-27a expression was significantly increased in VEGF-treated BCSLCs. Antagonizing miR-27a by miR-27a anti-sense oligos (ASOs) in VEGF-treated BCSLCs led to decreased endothelial markers and function, while increasing miR-27a in BCSLCs resulted in enhanced endothelial properties. VEGF enhanced the transcription of miR-27a by increasing RUNX1 binding to miR-27a promoter. Increased miR-27a paralleled the reduced expression of ZBTB10, a known miR-27a target. Both expression of miR-27a and knockdown of ZBTB10 in BCSLCs promoted in vivo angiogenesis and tumor metastasis. Further, we demonstrated that VEGF-treated BCSLCs secreted more endogenous VEGF compared with undifferentiated BCSLCs. Thus, miR-27a promotes angiogenesis by mediating endothelial differentiation of BCSLCs and it may be a new target for anti-angiogenesis cancer therapy."
https://openalex.org/W2031673728,"S100A4 is a small calcium-binding protein that is commonly overexpressed in a range of different tumor types, and it is widely accepted that S100A4 has an important role in the process of cancer metastasis. In vitro binding assays has shown that S100A4 interacts with the tumor suppressor protein p53, indicating that S100A4 may have additional roles in tumor development. In the present study, we show that endogenous S100A4 and p53 interact in complex samples, and that the interaction increases after inhibition of MDM2-dependent p53 degradation using Nutlin-3A. Further, using proximity ligation assay, we show that the interaction takes place in the cell nucleus. S100A4 knockdown experiments in two p53 wild-type cell lines, A549 and HeLa, resulted in stabilization of p53 protein, indicating that S100A4 is promoting p53 degradation. Finally, we demonstrate that S100A4 knockdown leads to p53-dependent cell cycle arrest and increased cisplatin-induced apoptosis. Thus, our data add a new layer to the oncogenic properties of S100A4 through its inhibition of p53-dependent processes."
https://openalex.org/W2023150418,"If the primary goal of artificial reef construction is the creation of additional reef habitat that is comparable to adjacent natural rocky-reef, then performance should be evaluated using simultaneous comparisons with adjacent natural habitats. Using baited remote underwater video (BRUV) fish assemblages on purpose-built estuarine artificial reefs and adjacent natural rocky-reef and sand-flat were assessed 18 months post-deployment in three south-east Australian estuaries. Fish abundance, species richness and diversity were found to be greater on the artificial reefs than on either naturally occurring reef or sand-flat in all estuaries. Comparisons within each estuary identified significant differences in the species composition between the artificial and natural rocky-reefs. The artificial reef assemblage was dominated by sparid species including Acanthopagrus australis and Rhabdosargus sarba. The preference for a range of habitats by theses sparid species is evident by their detection on sand-flat, natural rocky reef and artificial reef habitats. The fish assemblage identified on the artificial reefs remained distinct from the adjacent rocky-reef, comprising a range of species drawn from naturally occurring rocky-reef and sand-flat. In addition, some mid-water schooling species including Trachurus novaezelandiae and Pseudocaranx georgianus were only identified on the artificial reef community; presumably as result of the reef's isolated location in open-water. We concluded that estuarine artificial reef assemblages are likely to differ significantly from adjacent rocky-reef, potentially as a result of physical factors such as reef isolation, coupled with species specific behavioural traits such as the ability of some species to traverse large sand flats in order to locate reef structure, and feeding preferences. Artificial reefs should not be viewed as direct surrogates for natural reef. The assemblages are likely to remain distinct from naturally occurring habitat comprised of species that reside on a range of adjacent natural habitats."
https://openalex.org/W2070513612,"Parkinson disease (PD) is a chronic neurodegenerative disease characterized by a slow and progressive degeneration of dopaminergic neurons in substantia nigra. The pathophysiological mechanisms underlying PD remain unclear. Pin1, a major peptidyl-prolyl isomerase, has recently been associated with certain diseases. Notably, Ryo et al. (Ryo, A., Togo, T., Nakai, T., Hirai, A., Nishi, M., Yamaguchi, A., Suzuki, K., Hirayasu, Y., Kobayashi, H., Perrem, K., Liou, Y. C., and Aoki, I. (2006) J. Biol. Chem. 281, 4117-4125) implicated Pin1 in PD pathology. Therefore, we sought to systematically characterize the role of Pin1 in PD using cell culture and animal models. To our surprise we observed a dramatic up-regulation of Pin1 mRNA and protein levels in dopaminergic MN9D neuronal cells treated with the parkinsonian toxicant 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium (MPP(+)) as well as in the substantia nigra of the 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-induced PD mouse model. Notably, a marked expression of Pin1 was also observed in the substantia nigra of human PD brains along with a high co-localization of Pin1 within dopaminergic neurons. In functional studies, siRNA-mediated knockdown of Pin1 almost completely prevented MPP(+)-induced caspase-3 activation and DNA fragmentation, indicating that Pin1 plays a proapoptotic role. Interestingly, multiple pharmacological Pin1 inhibitors, including juglone, attenuated MPP(+)-induced Pin1 up-regulation, α-synuclein aggregation, caspase-3 activation, and cell death. Furthermore, juglone treatment in the MPTP mouse model of PD suppressed Pin1 levels and improved locomotor deficits, dopamine depletion, and nigral dopaminergic neuronal loss. Collectively, our findings demonstrate for the first time that Pin1 is up-regulated in PD and has a pathophysiological role in the nigrostriatal dopaminergic system and suggest that modulation of Pin1 levels may be a useful translational therapeutic strategy in PD."
https://openalex.org/W2147952205,"MicroRNA (miR)-142 is up-regulated in the brain in HIV and SIV encephalitis (SIVE). We identified the cell types where miR-142 is up-regulated and its relevant downstream target. Fluorescent in situ hybridization combined with immunofluorescent labeling revealed that miR-142-3p and -5p are expressed within hippocampal neurons and myeloid cells in SIVE. Sirtuin1 (SIRT1) was predicted as a potential miR-142 target by analysis of its 3'-UTR and bioinformatic analysis of factors linked to altered hippocampal gene expression profile in SIVE. Overexpression of pre-miR-142 in HEK293T cells led to a 3.7-fold decrease in SIRT1 protein level. Examination of the individual effects of miR-142-5p and miR-142-3p through overexpression and inhibition studies revealed that significant effects on SIRT1 occurred only with miR-142-5p. Luciferase reporter assays revealed a 2.3-fold inhibition of expression due to interaction of miR-142 with the SIRT1 3'-UTR, mutation analysis revealed that only the miR-142-5p target site was active. MiR-142 expression in primary human neurons led to a small (1.3-fold) but significant decrease in SIRT1 protein level. Furthermore, qRT-PCR revealed up-regulation of miR-142-3p (6.4-fold) and -5p (3.9-fold) and down-regulation of SIRT1 (33-fold) in macrophages/microglia from animals with SIVE. We have therefore elucidated a miR-mediated mechanism of regulation of SIRT1 expression in SIVE."
https://openalex.org/W1990851216,"Cleft palate is a common congenital birth defect. The fibroblast growth factor (FGF) family has been shown to be important for palatogenesis, which elicits the regulatory functions by activating the FGF receptor tyrosine kinase. Mutations in Fgf or Fgfr are associated with cleft palate. To date, most mechanistic studies on FGF signaling in palate development have focused on FGFR2 in the epithelium. Although Fgfr1 is expressed in the cranial neural crest (CNC)-derived palate mesenchyme and Fgfr1 mutations are associated with palate defects, how FGFR1 in palate mesenchyme regulates palatogenesis is not well understood. Here, we reported that by using Wnt1(Cre) to delete Fgfr1 in neural crest cells led to cleft palate, cleft lip, and other severe craniofacial defects. Detailed analyses revealed that loss-of-function mutations in Fgfr1 did not abrogate patterning of CNC cells in palate shelves. However, it upset cell signaling in the frontofacial areas, delayed cell proliferation in both epithelial and mesenchymal compartments, prevented palate shelf elevation, and compromised palate shelf fusion. This is the first report revealing how FGF signaling in CNC cells regulates palatogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2018021892,"Background Recently, Cipriani and colleagues examined the relative efficacy of 12 new-generation antidepressants on major depression using network meta-analytic methods. They found that some of these medications outperformed others in patient response to treatment. However, several methodological criticisms have been raised about network meta-analysis and Cipriani's analysis in particular which creates the concern that the stated superiority of some antidepressants relative to others may be unwarranted. Materials and Methods A Monte Carlo simulation was conducted which involved replicating Cipriani's network meta-analysis under the null hypothesis (i.e., no true differences between antidepressants). The following simulation strategy was implemented: (1) 1000 simulations were generated under the null hypothesis (i.e., under the assumption that there were no differences among the 12 antidepressants), (2) each of the 1000 simulations were network meta-analyzed, and (3) the total number of false positive results from the network meta-analyses were calculated. Findings Greater than 7 times out of 10, the network meta-analysis resulted in one or more comparisons that indicated the superiority of at least one antidepressant when no such true differences among them existed. Interpretation Based on our simulation study, the results indicated that under identical conditions to those of the 117 RCTs with 236 treatment arms contained in Cipriani et al.'s meta-analysis, one or more false claims about the relative efficacy of antidepressants will be made over 70% of the time. As others have shown as well, there is little evidence in these trials that any antidepressant is more effective than another. The tendency of network meta-analyses to generate false positive results should be considered when conducting multiple comparison analyses."
https://openalex.org/W2095279387,"Activating mutations in the platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) receptor alpha (PDGFRA) have been described in patients with gastrointestinal stromal tumors or myeloid malignancies associated with hypereosinophilia. These patients respond well to imatinib mesylate, raising the question as to whether patients with a PDGF receptor mutation in other tumor types should receive a tyrosine kinase inhibitor treatment. We characterized 10 novel somatic point mutations in PDGFRA that have been reported in isolated cases of glioblastoma, melanoma, acute myeloid leukemia, peripheral nerve sheath tumors and neuroendocrine carcinoma. The PDGFRA transmembrane domain mutation V536E stimulated Ba/F3 cell growth and signaling via ERK and STAT5 in the absence of ligand. This mutant, identified in glioblastoma, was strongly inhibited by imatinib. Modeling suggested that the mutation modulates the packing of the transmembrane domain helices in the receptor dimer. By contrast, two mutations in highly conserved residues affected the receptor traffic to the cell surface or kinase activity, thereby preventing the response to PDGF. The other mutations had no significant impact on the receptor activity. This functional analysis matched the predictions of SIFT and PolyPhen for only five mutations and these algorithms do not discriminate gain from loss of function. Finally, an E996K variant that had been identified in a melanoma cell line was not expressed in these cells. Altogether, several newly identified PDGFRA mutations do not activate the receptor and may therefore represent passenger mutations. Our results also underline the importance of characterizing novel kinase alterations in cancer patients."
https://openalex.org/W1981417550,"Desmoglein 3 (Dsg3), the pemphigus vulgaris antigen, has recently been shown to be upregulated in squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) and has been identified as a good tumor-specific marker for clinical staging of cervical sentinel lymph nodes in head and neck SCC. However, little is known about its biological function in cancer. The actin-binding protein Ezrin and the activator protein 1 (AP-1) transcription factor are implicated in cancer progression and metastasis. Here, we report that Dsg3 regulates the activity of c-Jun/AP-1 as well as protein kinase C (PKC)-mediated phosphorylation of Ezrin-Thr567, which contributes to the accelerated motility of cancer cells. Ectopic expression of Dsg3 in cancer cell lines caused enhanced phosphorylation at Ezrin-Thr567 with concomitant augmented membrane protrusions, cell spreading and invasive phenotype. We showed that Dsg3 formed a complex with Ezrin at the plasma membrane that was required for its proper function of interacting with F-actin and CD44 as Dsg3 knockdown impaired these associations. The increased Ezrin phosphorylation in Dsg3-overexpressing cells could be abrogated substantially by various pharmacological inhibitors for Ser/Thr kinases, including PKC and Rho kinase that are known to activate Ezrin. Furthermore, a marked increase in c-Jun S63 phosphorylation, among others, was found in Dsg3-overexpressing cells and the activation of c-Jun/AP-1 was further supported by a luciferase reporter assay. Taken together, our study identifies a novel Dsg3-mediated c-Jun/AP-1 regulatory mechanism and PKC-dependent Ezrin phosphorylation that could be responsible for Dsg3-associated cancer metastasis."

https://openalex.org/W2050844272,"Birds and mammals both developed high performance hearts from a heart that must have been reptile-like and the hearts of extant reptiles have an unmatched variability in design. Yet, studies on cardiac development in reptiles are largely old and further studies are much needed as reptiles are starting to become used in molecular studies. We studied the growth of cardiac compartments and changes in morphology principally in the model organism corn snake (Pantherophis guttatus), but also in the genotyped anole (Anolis carolinenis and A. sagrei) and the Philippine sailfin lizard (Hydrosaurus pustulatus). Structures and chambers of the formed heart were traced back in development and annotated in interactive 3D pdfs. In the corn snake, we found that the ventricle and atria grow exponentially, whereas the myocardial volumes of the atrioventricular canal and the muscular outflow tract are stable. Ventricular development occurs, as in other amniotes, by an early growth at the outer curvature and later, and in parallel, by incorporation of the muscular outflow tract. With the exception of the late completion of the atrial septum, the adult design of the squamate heart is essentially reached halfway through development. This design strongly resembles the developing hearts of human, mouse and chicken around the time of initial ventricular septation. Subsequent to this stage, and in contrast to the squamates, hearts of endothermic vertebrates completely septate their ventricles, develop an insulating atrioventricular plane, shift and expand their atrioventricular canal toward the right and incorporate the systemic and pulmonary venous myocardium into the atria."
https://openalex.org/W2106141724,"Sarcolipin (SLN) regulates muscle-based nonshivering thermogenesis and is up-regulated with high-fat feeding (HFF). To investigate whether other muscle-based thermogenic systems compensate for a lack of Sln and to firmly establish SLN as a mediator of diet-induced thermogenesis (DIT), we measured muscle and whole-body energy expenditure in chow- and high-fat-fed Sln–/– and wild-type (WT) mice. Following HFF, resting muscle metabolic rate (VO2, μl/g/s) was increased similarly in WT (0.28±0.02 vs. 0.31 ±0.03) and Sln–/– (0.23±0.03 vs. 0.35±0.02) mice due to increased sympathetic nervous system activation in Sln–/– mice; however, whole-body metabolic rate (VO2, ml/kg/h) was lower in Sln–/– compared with WT mice following HFF but only during periods when the mice were active in their cages (WT, 2894±87 vs. Sln–/–, 2708±61). Treatment with the β-adrenergic receptor (β-AR) antagonist propranolol during HFF completely prevented muscle-based DIT in Sln–/– mice; however, it had no effect in WT mice, resulting in greater differences in whole-body metabolic rate and diet-induced weight gain. Our results suggest that β-AR signaling partially compensates for a lack of SLN to activate muscle-based DIT, but SLN is the primary and more effective mediator.—Bombardier, E., Smith, I.

https://openalex.org/W1993622749,"Introduction Post-stroke hypoxia is common, and may adversely affect outcome. We have recently shown that oxygen supplementation may improve early neurological recovery. Here, we report the six-month outcomes of this pilot study. Methods Patients with a clinical diagnosis of acute stroke were randomized within 24 h of admission to oxygen supplementation at 2 or 3 L/min for 72 h or to control treatment (room air). Outcomes (see below) were assessed by postal questionnaire at 6 months. Analysis was by intention-to-treat, and statistical significance was set at p≤0.05. Results Out of 301 patients randomized two refused/withdrew consent and 289 (148 in the oxygen and 141 in the control group) were included in the analysis: males 44%, 51%; mean (SD) age 73 (12), 71 (12); median (IQR) National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score 6 (3, 10), 5 (3, 10) for the two groups respectively. At six months 22 (15%) patients in the oxygen group and 20 (14%) in the control group had died; mean survival in both groups was 162 days (p = 0.99). Median (IQR) scores for the primary outcome, the modified Rankin Scale, were 3 (1, 5) and 3 (1, 4) for the oxygen and control groups respectively. The covariate-adjusted odds ratio was 1.04 (95% CI 0.67, 1.60), indicating that the odds of a lower (i.e. better) score were non-significantly higher in the oxygen group (p = 0.86). The mean differences in the ability to perform basic (Barthel Index) and extended activities of daily living (NEADL), and quality of life (EuroQol) were also non-significant. Conclusions None of the key outcomes differed at 6 months between the groups. Although not statistically significant and generally of small magnitude, the effects were predominantly in favour of the oxygen group; a larger trial, powered to show differences in longer-term functional outcomes, is now on-going.

https://openalex.org/W2029485666,"Chondroadherin, a leucine rich repeat extracellular matrix protein with functions in cell to matrix interactions, binds cells via their α2β1 integrin as well as via cell surface proteoglycans, providing for different sets of signals to the cell. Additionally, the protein acts as an anchor to the matrix by binding tightly to collagens type I and II as well as type VI. We generated mice with inactivated chondroadherin gene to provide integrated studies of the role of the protein. The null mice presented distinct phenotypes with affected cartilage as well as bone. At 3-6 weeks of age the epiphyseal growth plate was widened most pronounced in the proliferative zone. The proteome of the femoral head articular cartilage at 4 months of age showed some distinct differences, with increased deposition of cartilage intermediate layer protein 1 and fibronectin in the chondroadherin deficient mice, more pronounced in the female. Other proteins show decreased levels in the deficient mice, particularly pronounced for matrilin-1, thrombospondin-1 and notably the members of the α1-antitrypsin family of proteinase inhibitors as well as for a member of the bone morphogenetic protein growth factor family. Thus, cartilage homeostasis is distinctly altered. The bone phenotype was expressed in several ways. The number of bone sialoprotein mRNA expressing cells in the proximal tibial metaphysic was decreased and the osteoid surface was increased possibly indicating a change in mineral metabolism. Micro-CT revealed lower cortical thickness and increased structure model index, i.e. the amount of plates and rods composing the bone trabeculas. The structural changes were paralleled by loss of function, where the null mice showed lower femoral neck failure load and tibial strength during mechanical testing at 4 months of age. The skeletal phenotype points at a role for chondroadherin in both bone and cartilage homeostasis, however, without leading to altered longitudinal growth."
https://openalex.org/W2172202192,"We examined the effects of a natural secondary bile acid, hyodeoxycholic acid (HDCA), on lipid metabolism and atherosclerosis in LDL receptor-null (LDLRKO) mice. Female LDLRKO mice were maintained on a Western diet for 8 wk and then divided into 2 groups that received chow, or chow + 1.25% HDCA, diets for 15 wk. We observed that mice fed the HDCA diet were leaner and exhibited a 37% (P<0.05) decrease in fasting plasma glucose level. HDCA supplementation significantly decreased atherosclerotic lesion size at the aortic root region, the entire aorta, and the innominate artery by 44% (P<0.0001), 48% (P<0.01), and 94% (P<0.01), respectively, as compared with the chow group. Plasma VLDL/IDL/LDL cholesterol levels were significantly decreased, by 61% (P<0.05), in the HDCA group as compared with the chow diet group. HDCA supplementation decreased intestinal cholesterol absorption by 76% (P<0.0001) as compared with the chow group. Furthermore, HDL isolated from the HDCA group exhibited significantly increased ability to mediate cholesterol efflux ex vivo as compared with HDL of the chow diet group. In addition, HDCA significantly increased the expression of genes involved in cholesterol efflux, such as Abca1, Abcg1, and Apoe, in a macrophage cell line. Thus, HDCA is a candidate for antiatherosclerotic drug therapy."

An increasing interest in producing HLA-G as a clinical-grade molecule for therapy use is impaired by its complexity and limited stability. Our purpose was to engineer simpler and more stable HLA-G-derived molecules than the full-length HLA-G trimolecular complex that are also tolerogenic, functional as soluble molecules, and compatible with good manufacturing practice (GMP) production conditions. We present two synthetic molecules: (α3-L)x2 and (α1-α3)x2 polypeptides. We show their capability to bind the HLA-G receptor LILRB2 and their functions in vitro and in vivo. The (α1-α3)x2 polypeptide proved to be a potent tolerogenic molecule in vivo: One treatment of skin allograft recipient mice with (α1-α3)x2 was sufficient to significantly prolong graft survival, and four weekly treatments induced complete tolerance. Furthermore, (α1-α3)x2 was active as a soluble molecule and capable of inhibiting the proliferation of tumor cell lines, as does the full length HLA-G trimolecular complex. Thus, the synthetic (α1-α3)x2 polypeptide is a stable and simpler alternative to the full-length HLA-G molecule. It can be produced under GMP conditions, it functions as a soluble molecule, and it is at least as tolerogenic as HLA-G in vivo.—LeMaoult, J., Daouya, M., Wu, J., Loustau, M., Horuzsko, A., Carosella, E.

https://openalex.org/W2032387121,"Prolactin-induced Protein (PIP), an aspartyl protease unessential for normal mammalian cell function, is required for the proliferation and invasion of some breast cancer (BCa) cell types. Because PIP expression is particularly high in the Luminal A BCa subtype, we investigated the roles of PIP in the related T47D BCa cell line. Nucleic acid and antibody arrays were employed to screen effects of PIP silencing on global gene expression and activation of receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs), respectively. Expression of PIP-stimulated genes, as defined in the T47D cell culture model, was well correlated with the expression of PIP itself across a cohort of 557 mRNA profiles of diverse BCa tumors, and bioinformatics analysis revealed cJUN and cMYC as major nodes in the PIP-dependent gene network. Among 71 RTKs tested, PIP silencing resulted in decreased phosphorylation of focal adhesion kinase (FAK), ephrin B3 (EphB3), FYN, and hemopoietic cell kinase (HCK). Ablation of PIP also abrogated serum-induced activation of the downstream serine/threonine kinases AKT, ERK1/2, and JNK1. Consistent with these results, PIP-depleted cells exhibited defects in adhesion to fibronectin, cytoskeletal stress fiber assembly and protein secretion. In addition, PIP silencing abrogated the mitogenic response of T47D BCa cells to estradiol (E2). The dependence of BCa cell proliferation was unrelated, however, to estrogen signaling because: 1) PIP silencing did not affect the transcriptional response of estrogen target genes to hormone treatment, and 2) PIP was required for the proliferation of tamoxifen-resistant BCa cells. Pharmacological inhibition of PIP may therefore serve the bases for both augmentation of existing therapies for hormone-dependent tumors and the development of novel therapeutic approaches for hormone-resistant BCa."
https://openalex.org/W1990893697,"Most endometrial cancers can be classified histologically as endometrioid, serous, or clear cell. Non-endometrioid endometrial cancers (NEECs; serous and clear cell) are the most clinically aggressive of the three major histotypes and are characterized by aneuploidy, a feature of chromosome instability. The genetic alterations that underlie chromosome instability in endometrial cancer are poorly understood. In the present study, we used Sanger sequencing to search for nucleotide variants in the coding exons and splice junctions of 21 candidate chromosome instability genes, including 19 genes implicated in sister chromatid cohesion, from 24 primary, microsatellite-stable NEECs. Somatic mutations were verified by sequencing matched normal DNAs. We subsequently resequenced mutated genes from 41 additional NEECs as well as 42 endometrioid ECs (EECs). We uncovered nonsynonymous somatic mutations in ESCO1, CHTF18, and MRE11A in, respectively, 3.7% (4 of 107), 1.9% (2 of 107), and 1.9% (2 of 107) of endometrial tumors. Overall, 7.7% (5 of 65) of NEECs and 2.4% (1 of 42) of EECs had somatically mutated one or more of the three genes. A subset of mutations are predicted to impact protein function. The co-occurrence of somatic mutations in ESCO1 and CHTF18 was statistically significant (P = 0.0011, two-tailed Fisher's exact test). This is the first report of somatic mutations within ESCO1 and CHTF18 in endometrial tumors and of MRE11A mutations in microsatellite-stable endometrial tumors. Our findings warrant future studies to determine whether these mutations are driver events that contribute to the pathogenesis of endometrial cancer."
https://openalex.org/W1977144362,"Background Retinal degeneration in transgenic rats that express a mutant cilia gene polycystin-2 (CMV-PKD2(1/703)HA) is characterized by initial photoreceptor degeneration and glial activation, followed by vasoregression and neuronal degeneration (Feng et al., 2009, PLoS One 4: e7328). It is unknown whether glial activation contributes to neurovascular degeneration after photoreceptor degeneration. We characterized the reactivity of Müller glial cells in retinas of rats that express defective polycystin-2. Methods Age-matched Sprague-Dawley rats served as control. Retinal slices were immunostained for intermediate filaments, the potassium channel Kir4.1, and aquaporins 1 and 4. The potassium conductance of isolated Müller cells was recorded by whole-cell patch clamping. The osmotic swelling characteristics of Müller cells were determined by superfusion of retinal slices with a hypoosmotic solution. Findings Müller cells in retinas of transgenic rats displayed upregulation of GFAP and nestin which was not observed in control cells. Whereas aquaporin-1 labeling of photoreceptor cells disappeared along with the degeneration of the cells, aquaporin-1 emerged in glial cells in the inner retina of transgenic rats. Aquaporin-4 was upregulated around degenerating photoreceptor cells. There was an age-dependent redistribution of Kir4.1 in retinas of transgenic rats, with a more even distribution along glial membranes and a downregulation of perivascular Kir4.1. Müller cells of transgenic rats displayed a slight decrease in their Kir conductance as compared to control. Müller cells in retinal tissues from transgenic rats swelled immediately under hypoosmotic stress; this was not observed in control cells. Osmotic swelling was induced by oxidative-nitrosative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, and inflammatory lipid mediators. Interpretation Cellular swelling suggests that the rapid water transport through Müller cells in response to osmotic stress is altered as compared to control. The dislocation of Kir4.1 will disturb the retinal potassium and water homeostasis, and osmotic generation of free radicals and inflammatory lipids may contribute to neurovascular injury."
https://openalex.org/W2127266136,"ADAMDEC1 (Decysin-1) is a putative ADAM (a disintegrin and metalloprotease)-like metalloprotease with an unknown physiological role, selectively expressed in mature dendritic cells and macrophages. When compared with other members of the ADAM family, ADAMDEC1 displays some unusual features. It lacks the auxiliary cysteine-rich, EGF, and transmembrane domains, as well as the cytoplasmic tail. The active site of ADAMDEC1 is unique by being the only mammalian ADAM protease with a non-histidine zinc ligand, having an aspartic acid residue instead. Here we demonstrate that ADAMDEC1, despite these unique features, functions as an active metalloprotease. Thus, ADAMDEC1 is secreted as a mature, glycosylated, and proteolytically active metalloprotease, capable of cleaving macromolecular substrates. In the recombinant form, three of the four potential N-linked glycosylation sites are modified by carbohydrate attachment. Substitution of basic residues at the predicted proprotein convertase cleavage site blocks proprotein processing, revealing both specific ADAMDEC1-dependent and specific ADAMDEC1-independent cleavage of the prodomain. The pro-form of ADAMDEC1 does not have proteolytic activity, demonstrating that the prodomain of ADAMDEC1, like in other members of the ADAM family, confers catalytic latency. Interestingly, the proteolytic activity of mature ADAMDEC1 can be significantly enhanced when a canonical ADAM active site with three zinc-coordinating histidine residues is introduced."

However, the detailed roles of many plant CBFs are far from fully understood. A CBF gene (SsCBF1) was isolated from the cold-hardy plant Solanum lycopersicoides. A subcellular localization study using GFP fusion protein indicated that SsCBF1 is localized in the nucleus. We delimited the SsCBF1 transcriptional activation domain to the C-terminal segment comprising amino acid residues 193-228 (SsCBF1(193-228)). The expression of SsCBF1 could be dramatically induced by cold, drought and high salinity. Transactivation assays in tobacco leaves revealed that SsCBF1 could specifically bind to the CRT cis-elements in vivo to activate the expression of downstream reporter genes. The ectopic overexpression of SsCBF1 conferred increased freezing and high-salinity tolerance and late flowering phenotype to transgenic Arabidopsis. RNA-sequencing data exhibited that a set of cold and salt stress responsive genes were up-regulated in transgenic Arabidopsis. Our results suggest that SsCBF1 behaves as a typical CBF to contribute to plant freezing tolerance. Increased resistance to high-salinity and late flowering phenotype derived from SsCBF1 OE lines lend more credence to the hypothesis that plant CBFs participate in diverse physiological and biochemical processes related to adverse conditions."
https://openalex.org/W1987756097,"Basal cell carcinoma (BCC), the most common type of cancer, is characterized by aberrant Hedgehog (Hh) pathway activity. Mutations in pathway components, such as PATCHED1 (PTCH1), are commonly found in BCC. While the tumor suppressor role of PTCH1 in BCC is well established, how Hh pathway activation disrupts normal skin homeostasis to promote BCC formationremains poorly understood. Like Ptc1, Sufu is a major negative regulator of the Hh pathway. Previously, we showed that inactivation of Sufu in the skin does not result in BCC formation. Why loss of Ptc1, but not Sufu, in the epidermis induces BCC formation is unclear. In this report, we utilized gene expression profiling to identify biological pathways and processes that distinguish Sufu from Ptc1 mutants, and discovered a novel role for Sufu in cell cycle regulation. We demonstrated that the Hh pathway activation inSufu and Ptc1 mutant skin is associated with abnormal cell cycle entry, ectopic expression of D-type cyclins and increasedDNA damage. However, despite the presence of DNA damage, p53 stabilization was impaired in the mutant skin. Alternative mechanism to halt genomic instability is the activation of G2/M cell cycle checkpoint, which can occur independent of p53. We found that while Ptc1 mutant cells continue to cycle, which would favor genomic instability, loss of Sufu results in G2/M cell cycle arrest.This finding may explain why inactivation of Sufu is not sufficient to drive BCC formation. Taken together, these studies revealed a unique role for Sufu in G2/M phase progression, and uncovered the molecular and cellular features associated with Hh-driven BCC."

This provided an ideal ligand to study binding and activation mechanisms of the two closely related CCK receptors. We utilized intracellular calcium mobilization assays and competition binding for small molecule benzodiazepine radioligands, selective for each of the two receptors, in combination with a series of chimeric CCK1R/CCK2R constructs systematically interchanging the distinct residues lining this pocket in these two subtypes of CCK receptors (3.Cawston E.E.

To guide mechanistic interpretation of the data, a ligand-directed approach (6.Katritch V. Rueda M. Lam P.C. Yeager M. Abagyan R. GPCR 3D homology models for ligand screening. Lessons learned from blind predictions of adenosine A2a receptor complex.Proteins. 2010; 78: 197-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar) was used to build molecular models for the intramembranous, interhelical small molecule agonist-binding pocket within the type 1 CCK receptor, starting from the previously described model of the antagonist-occupied receptor (3.Cawston E.E. Lam P.C. Harikumar K.G. Dong M. Ball A.M. Augustine M.L. Akgün E. Portoghese P.S. Orry A. Abagyan R. Sexton P.M. Miller L.J.

The optimal model in this series was distinct from the previously described antagonist pocket and fully compatible with all the experimental data for the CCK receptor constructs. The model effectively differentiated type 1 CCK receptor agonists from approved drugs, as well as from other CCK receptor ligands. Of note, this model provided insights into the molecular basis for agonist action, particularly of benzodiazepine agonists, which uniformly interacted with Leu7.39 in transmembrane segment 7. For GI181771X, the portion of the ligand predicted to interact with this receptor residue was the isopropyl group in the N1 position of the benzodiazepine ring; this position was previously identified in ligand structure-activity series as an “agonist trigger” (4.Aquino C.J.

The molecular models that were generated in this work also provided an explanation for why this compound did not exhibit any biological agonist activity at the structurally related type 2 CCK receptor. Ham's F-12 medium, Opti-MEM medium, l-glutamine, LipofectamineTM LTX and PLUSTM reagents were from Invitrogen. Quest Fluo-8-AMTM was from AAT Bioquest Inc. (Sunnyvale, CA). Fetal Clone II tissue culture medium supplement was from Hyclone Laboratories (Logan, UT). MicroscintTM, Unifilter 96-well microplates with bonded GF/B filters were from PerkinElmer Life Sciences.

Cholecystokinin octapeptide (CCK-26–33 based on the numbering of CCK-33; also known as CCK-8) was purchased from Peninsula Laboratories (Belmont, CA). The CCK-like radioactive tracer, 125I-d-Tyr-Gly-[(Nle28,31)CCK-26–33], was prepared by oxidative radioiodination of the parental peptide using IODO-BEADs (Pierce) with purification to homogeneity on reversed-phase HPLC, as described previously (7.Pearson R.K.

All other reagents were analytical grade. The 1,5-benzodiazepine agonist ligand (GI181771X) was provided by GlaxoSmithKline Research Laboratories (Research Triangle Park, NC).

Radioiodinated 1,4-benzodiazepine ligands for the type 1 and type 2 CCK receptors were prepared by oxidative radioiodination using IODO-BEADs, and purifying the product to homogeneity with a specific radioactivity of ∼2000 Ci/mmol on reversed-phase HPLC, as described previously (9.Akgün E.

Chem. 2009; 52: 2138-2147Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Flp-In Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell lines were engineered to stably express a series of CCK receptor constructs, using the approach previously reported (10.Hadac E.M. Ghanekar D.V. Holicky E.L. Pinon D.I. Dougherty R.W. Miller L.J. Relationship between native and recombinant cholecystokinin receptors. Role of differential glycosylation.Pancreas. 1996; 13: 130-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). These included both wild-type CCK1R and CCK2R receptors, as well as a series of intramembranous chimeric receptor constructs previously studied as transiently expressed on COS cells (3.Cawston E.E. Lam P.C. Harikumar K.G. Dong M. Ball A.M. Augustine M.L. Akgün E. Portoghese P.S. Orry A. Abagyan R. Sexton P.M. Miller L.J.

Chem. 2012; 287: 18618-18635Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). The design of these chimeric receptor constructs was based on the residues lining the intramembranous, interhelical small molecule binding pocket, exchanging those residues that are different in the two subtypes of CCK receptors. Fig. 1 shows the alignment of the sequences of types 1 and 2 CCK receptors predicted to represent the seven transmembrane segments. Shaded residues are those predicted to line this pocket. Residues involved in the chimeric constructs are identified in italics (2.61, 3.28, 3.29, 6.51, 6.52, and 7.39). The receptor constructs were cloned into the FRT/pcDNA5.0 expression vector and sequences were confirmed by DNA sequencing. The parental Flp-In CHO cells not expressing either type of CCK receptor were transfected when at 80% confluence in 6-well plates using a combination of 0.5 μg of receptor cDNA expressed in FRT/pcDNA5 vector and 4.5 μg of pOG44 (Flp recombinase expression vector) using Lipofectamine LTX and PLUS reagent mixture in Opti-MEM medium following the manufacturer's instructions. Stable transfectants were selected using 400 μg/ml of hygromycin to isolate antibiotic-resistant cells. Levels of receptor expression in the cell lines were characterized using radioligand binding assays (described below). These cell lines were grown in tissue culture flasks containing Ham's F-12 medium supplemented with 5% Fetal Clone II in a humidified environment containing 5% carbon dioxide. Cells were passaged approximately two times per week. Membrane fractions enriched in plasma membranes were isolated from the receptor-bearing cell lines, as described previously (10.Hadac E.M. Ghanekar D.V. Holicky E.L. Pinon D.I. Dougherty R.W. Miller L.J. Relationship between native and recombinant cholecystokinin receptors. Role of differential glycosylation.Pancreas. 1996; 13: 130-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Cells at 80–90% confluence were harvested mechanically using a cell scraper and were suspended in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4. The membrane fraction of interest was isolated using sucrose density gradient centrifugation, as described previously (11.Harikumar K.G. Pinon D.I. Wessels W.S. Prendergast F.G. Miller L.J. Environment and mobility of a series of fluorescent reporters at the amino terminus of structurally related peptide agonists and antagonists bound to the cholecystokinin receptor.J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 18552-18560Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), and was suspended in Krebs-Ringer/HEPES (KRH) medium (25 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 104 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1.5 mm CaCl2, 1.0 mm KH2PO4, 1.2 mm MgSO4, 1.2 mm MgCl2) containing 0.01% soybean trypsin inhibitor and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Membranes were stored at −80 °C until use. Radioligand binding assays were carried out using CCK-like or benzodiazepine radioligands (the BDZ-1 radioligand binds with high affinity to the type 1 CCK receptor and the BDZ-2 radioligand binds with high affinity to the type 2 CCK receptor), as described previously (9.Akgün E. Körner M. Gao F. Harikumar K.G. Waser B. Reubi J.C. Portoghese P.S. Miller L.J. Synthesis and in vitro characterization of radioiodinatable benzodiazepines selective for type 1 and type 2 cholecystokinin receptors.J. Med. Chem. 2009; 52: 2138-2147Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The membrane suspensions (5–15 μg of protein/sample) were incubated in duplicate with radioligand (∼10,000 cpm/well) in KRH medium at room temperature for 60 min in the absence and presence of increasing concentrations of unlabeled CCK or GI181771X. The amounts of radioactivity bound in the presence of 1 μm unlabeled BDZ ligands or 0.1 μm CCK in the respective assays were defined as non-saturable binding. The receptor-bound fraction and the free radioligand were separated by vacuum filtration using Unifilter 96-well microplate-bound membrane GF/B filter mats in a Filtermate Harvester (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The plates were washed three times with wash buffer (0.9% NaCl and 0.2% bovine serum albumin), air-dried, soaked in 30 μl of MicroscintTM, and radioactivity was quantified using a Top CountNXTTM instrument (Packard, Meriden, CT) that had counting efficiency for 125I of 23%. Data were analyzed using the LIGAND program of Munson and Rodbard (12.Munson P.J. Rodbard D. Ligand. A versatile computerized approach for characterization of ligand-binding systems.Anal. Biochem. 1980; 107: 220-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (7771) Google Scholar), and graphed using the nonlinear least-squares curve-fitting routine in Prism 5 (GraphPad, San Diego, CA). Ligand-stimulated biological activity was quantified by measuring the intracellular calcium responses to agonists in intact cells (13.Harikumar K.G. Potter R.M. Patil A. Echeveste V. Miller L.J. Membrane cholesterol affects stimulus-activity coupling in type 1, but not type 2, CCK receptors. Use of cell lines with elevated cholesterol.Lipids. 2013; 48: 231-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The natural peptidyl agonist, CCK, was used as control and the benzodiazepine that is the focus of this work, GI181771X, was used as the experimental agonist. All intracellular calcium responses to GI181771X were expressed as percentages of the control responses to CCK. Cells were seeded in sterile clear-bottom black 96-well tissue culture plates 24 h before the assay, and studied when they reached approximate confluence of 70–80%. They were washed with KRH medium containing 2.5 mm probenecid and 0.2% bovine serum albumin, and incubated with 1.5 μm Quest Fluo 8 (dissolved in anhydrous dimethyl sulfoxide) for 1 h at 37 °C in the dark. The calcium response assay was initiated by addition of agonist ligands. The incubation was terminated by aspirating the medium and washing the cells. The assay was performed in a Flexstation 3.0 plate reader (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA) using robotic addition of the appropriate agonist ligand (GI181771X or CCK). Intracellular calcium responses were measured at 37 °C by quantifying the fluorescence emission intensity at 525 nm after exciting the samples at 485 nm, with data collection every 4 s over a 120-s period. Data were plotted using Prism 5 (Graphpad), and peak responses were identified. All molecular modeling was conducted using a stochastic global energy optimization procedure in internal coordinate mechanics (ICM) (14.Abagyan R.A. Totrov M.M. Kuznetsov D.A. Icm: a new method for protein modeling and design. Applications to docking and structure prediction from the distorted native conformation.J. Comp. Chem. 1994; 15: 488-506Crossref Scopus (1362) Google Scholar) with the ICM-Pro package version 3.7-2 (MolSoft LLC, San Diego, CA), as we have previously reported (14.Abagyan R.A. Totrov M.M. Kuznetsov D.A. Icm: a new method for protein modeling and design. Applications to docking and structure prediction from the distorted native conformation.J. Comp. Chem. 1994; 15: 488-506Crossref Scopus (1362) Google Scholar). This procedure consisted of three iterative steps: (a) random conformational change of a dihedral angle according to the biased-probability Monte Carlo method (15.Abagyan R. Totrov M. Biased probability Monte Carlo conformational searches and electrostatic calculations for peptides and proteins.J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 235: 983-1002Crossref PubMed Scopus (812) Google Scholar); (b) local minimization of all free dihedral angles; and (c) acceptance or rejection of the new conformation based on the Metropolis criterion at the simulation temperature, usually at 600 K (16.Metropolis N.R.A. Rosenbluth M.N. Teller A.H. Teller E. Equation of state calculations by fast computing machines.J. Chem. Phys. 1953; 21: 1087-1092Crossref Scopus (27313) Google Scholar). The ligand-guided homology modeling method (6.Katritch V. Rueda M. Lam P.C. Yeager M. Abagyan R. GPCR 3D homology models for ligand screening. Lessons learned from blind predictions of adenosine A2a receptor complex.Proteins. 2010; 78: 197-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar) that we previously used to construct a model of the type 1 CCK receptor in its inactive conformation (3.Cawston E.E.

Chem. 2012; 287: 18618-18635Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) was utilized in this work. The inactive structure of this receptor was used as the starting point for the modeling of the active state ligand-binding pocket, and the principal intramembranous pocket was located and defined using ICM PocketFinder (17.An J. Totrov M. Abagyan R. Pocketome via comprehensive identification and classification of ligand binding envelopes.Mol. Cell Proteomics. 2005; 4: 752-761Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). A collection of 102 type 1 CCK receptor agonist ligands selected from the ChEMBL database (18.Overington J. ChEMBL. An interview with John Overington, team leader, chemogenomics at the European Bioinformatics Institute Outstation of the European Molecular Biology Laboratory (EMBL-EBI). Interview by Wendy A. Warr.J. Comput. Aided Mol. Des. 2009; 23: 195-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar) was used to mold the inactive pocket into an active conformation. A distance restraint was used between the ligand and an anchor residue on the receptor to limit the size of the sampling space and to keep the ligand within the pocket during the molecular modeling process. Previously, after attempting to use several different hydrogen bond donor-acceptor pairs, the best models were found to come from use of Asn6.55 as the anchor residue (3.Cawston E.E. Lam P.C. Harikumar K.G. Dong M. Ball A.M. Augustine M.L. Akgün E. Portoghese P.S. Orry A. Abagyan R. Sexton P.M. Miller L.J.

Chem. 2012; 287: 18618-18635Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). A defined hydrogen bond distance restraint with this residue was used during the simulations, and each ligand was docked to the pocket followed by cycles of stochastic global energy optimization, side chain sampling, backbone minimization, and loop modeling. This resulted in an ensemble of multiple receptor conformations for the agonist-occupied type 1 CCK receptor. Each pocket conformation in the ensemble was then evaluated using a composite score that included the ability to differentiate structurally diverse positives from decoys by docking scores, the percentage of ligands forming hydrogen bonds with the anchor residue (Asn6.55), and the consistency of docking poses based on clustering of these poses as assessed by Atomic Property Fields (19.Totrov M. Atomic property fields. Generalized three-dimensional pharmacophoric potential for automated ligand superposition, pharmacophore elucidation and three-dimensional QSAR.Chem. Biol. Drug Design. 2008; 71: 15-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). The best model was then formally evaluated using plots of receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves (20.Truchon J.F. Bayly C.I. Evaluating virtual screening methods. Good and bad metrics for the “early recognition” problem.J. Chem. Inf. Model. 2007; 47: 488-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (575) Google Scholar) to evaluate the ability to differentiate a set of positive ligands seeded with 1065 decoys, representing approved drugs in the ChEMBL database, as well as the ability to identify 130 known type 1 CCK receptor agonists having activities greater than 1 μm seeded into 2175 non-agonist ligands of the type 1 CCK receptor present in the ChEMBL database. This was evaluated in the most conservative way possible, because not all of the ligands have been tested for agonist activity, with the possibility that some molecules graded as false negatives were actual positives. Differences in receptor binding parameters between various constructs were analyzed with one-way analysis of variance and Dunnett's post test. Differences were considered to be significant at p < 0.05 (Prism 5, GraphPad). As has been previously described, the 1,5-benzodiazepine, GI181771X, bound specifically to type 1 and type 2 CCK receptors, and was a full agonist at the type 1 CCK receptor, whereas having no agonist activity at the type 2 CCK receptor (Fig. 2) (5.Hirst G.C. Aquino C. Birkemo L. Croom D.K. Dezube M. Dougherty Jr., R.W. Ervin G.N. Grizzle M.K. Henke B. James M.K. Johnson M.F. Momtahen T. Queen K.L. Sherrill R.G. Szewczyk J. Willson T.M. Sugg E.E.

In this type of binding assay, GI181771X completely inhibited the saturable binding of the CCK-like radioligand to the type 1 CCK receptor with an IC50 of 105 ± 13 nm and inhibited its saturable binding to the type 2 CCK receptor with an IC50 of 5.6 ± 0.1 nm.

https://openalex.org/W1995356376,"Many extracellular signals act via the Raf/MEK/ERK cascade in which kinetics, cell-cell variability, and sensitivity of the ERK response can all influence cell fate. Here we used automated microscopy to explore the effects of ERK-mediated negative feedback on these attributes in cells expressing endogenous ERK or ERK2-GFP reporters. We studied acute rather than chronic stimulation with either epidermal growth factor (ErbB1 activation) or phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate (PKC activation). In unstimulated cells, ERK-mediated negative feedback reduced the population-average and cell-cell variability of the level of activated ppERK and increased its robustness to changes in ERK expression. In stimulated cells, negative feedback (evident between 5 min and 4 h) also reduced average levels and variability of phosphorylated ERK (ppERK) without altering the ""gradedness"" or sensitivity of the response. Binning cells according to total ERK expression revealed, strikingly, that maximal ppERK responses initially occur at submaximal ERK levels and that this non-monotonic relationship changes to an increasing, monotonic one within 15 min. These phenomena occur in HeLa cells and MCF7 breast cancer cells and in the presence and absence of ERK-mediated negative feedback. They were best modeled assuming distributive (rather than processive) activation. Thus, we have uncovered a novel, time-dependent change in the relationship between total ERK and ppERK levels that persists without negative feedback. This change makes acute response kinetics dependent on ERK level and provides a ""gating"" or control mechanism in which the interplay between stimulus duration and the distribution of ERK expression across cells could modulate the proportion of cells that respond to stimulation."
https://openalex.org/W1996603937,"Small ArfGAP1 (stromal membrane-associated protein 1, SMAP1), a GTPase-activating protein specific for ADP-ribosylation factor 6 (Arf6), which is a small GTPase acting on membrane trafficking and actin remodeling, is frequently mutated in various tumors displaying microsatellite instability (MSI), notably in MSI colorectal cancers (CRC). Genotyping of 93 MSI CRCs (40 stage II, 32 stage III and 21 stage IV) allowed us to underscore that SMAP1 mutation frequency was inversely correlated with disease stage (P=0.01). Analysis of 46 cancer cell lines showed that SMAP1 mutations occurred only in MSI tumors, and consisted exclusively in short insertion or deletion in the coding 10-adenine repeat, generating a premature termination codon located downstream the ArfGAP domain. SMAP1 transcript levels were significant decreased (P=0.006), and truncated SMAP1 protein could not be detected in cells displaying biallelic SMAP1 mutations, owing to its sensitivity to proteasome degradation. To investigate the role of SMAP1 mutations, we used the SMAP1-null HCT116 cell line and we established three isogenic SMAP1-complemented clones. Cell proliferation was first assessed in vivo using subcutaneous xenografts into immunodeficient mice. Tumors developed in all animals regardless of the cell line injected, but tumor volumes were significantly smaller for both SMAP1-complemented clones compared with HCT116 (P<0.0001, at the time of killing). In vitro, SMAP1 mutations also increased cell clonogenicity (P=0.02-0.04), cell proliferation (P=0.008) by shortening the G2/M phase and decreased cell invasiveness (P=0.03-0.003). In keeping, SMAP1-complemented HCT116 gained several mesenchymal markers (Snail, Slug and vimentin) considered as a hallmark of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition. These observations are reminiscent of some clinical characteristics of MSI CRCs, notably their larger size and lower rate of metastasis. Our observations suggest that SMAP1 loss-of-function mutations in MSI CRC may contribute to the emerging oncogenic pathway involving abnormal Arf6 regulation."

Sample preparation involved protein precipitation followed by one to one dilution with water. The analyte, efavirenz was separated by high performance liquid chromatography and detected with tandem mass spectrometry in negative ionization mode with multiple reaction monitoring. Efavirenz and ¹³C₆-efavirenz (Internal Standard), respectively, were detected via the following MRM transitions: m/z 314.20243.90 and m/z 320.20249.90. A gradient program was used to elute the analytes using 0.1% formic acid in water and 0.1% formic acid in acetonitrile as mobile phase solvents, at a flow-rate of 0.3 mL/min. The total run time was 5 min and the retention times for the internal standard (¹³C₆-efavirenz) and efavirenz was approximately 2.6 min. The calibration curves showed linearity (coefficient of regression, r>0.99) over the concentration range of 1.0-2,500 ng/mL. The intraday precision based on the standard deviation of replicates of lower limit of quantification (LLOQ) was 9.24% and for quality control (QC) samples ranged from 2.41% to 6.42% and with accuracy from 112% and 100-111% for LLOQ and QC samples. The inter day precision was 12.3% and 3.03-9.18% for LLOQ and quality controls samples, and the accuracy was 108% and 95.2-108% for LLOQ and QC samples. Stability studies showed that efavirenz was stable during the expected conditions for sample preparation and storage. The lower limit of quantification for efavirenz was 1 ng/mL. The analytical method showed excellent sensitivity, precision, and accuracy. This method is robust and is being successfully applied for therapeutic drug monitoring and pharmacokinetic studies in HIV-infected patients."
https://openalex.org/W2034243056,"Ku70, a known nonhomologous end-joining (NHEJ) factor, also functions in tumor suppression, although this molecular mechanism remains uncharacterized. Previously, we showed that mice deficient for DNA ligase IV (Lig4), another key NHEJ factor, succumbed to aggressive lymphoma in the absence of tumor suppressor p53. However, the tumor phenotype is abrogated by the introduction of a hypomorphic mutant p53R172P, which impaired p53-mediated apoptosis but not cell-cycle arrest. However, Lig4−/−p53R172P mice succumbed to severe diabetes. To further elucidate the role of NHEJ and p53-mediated apoptosis in vivo, we bred Ku70−/− p53R172P mice. Unexpectedly, these mice were free of diabetes, although 80% of the mutant mice had abnormally enlarged colons with pronounced inflammation. Remarkably, most of these mutant mice progressed to dysplasia, adenoma and adenocarcinoma; this is in contrast to the Lig4−/−p53R172P phenotype, strongly suggesting an NHEJ-independent function of Ku70. Significantly, our analyses of Ku70−/−p53R172P colonic epithelial cells show nuclear stabilization of β-catenin accompanied by higher expression of cyclin D1 and c-Myc in affected colon sections than in control samples. This is not due to the p53 mutation, as Ku70−/− mice share this phenotype. Our results not only unravel a novel function of Ku70 essential for colon homeostasis, but also establish an excellent in vivo model in which to study how chronic inflammation and abnormal cellular proliferation underlie tumorigenesis and tumor progression in the colon."
https://openalex.org/W2149531141,"CD44 variant (CD44v) isoforms play important roles in the development of autoimmune disorders, including colitis and arthritis, but their role in multiple sclerosis (MS) has been explored only to a limited extent. We determined the functional relevance of CD44v isoforms in MS and its animal model, experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). Genetic ablation of CD44v7 and CD44v10 isoforms significantly reduced the clinical EAE burden, as well as the number of inflammatory infiltrates. CD44v7 and CD44v10 expression on both memory T and antigen-presenting cells, participated in the development of adoptive transfer EAE. Significantly reduced mRNA expression of Th1 signature genes was detected in the brains of CD44v10–/– mice compared with those of CD44WT mice. Furthermore, forkhead transcription factor 3 (Foxp3), Bcl-2, and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) levels were reduced in CD44v10–/– brains, whereas active caspase-3 was elevated. Brain-infiltrating CD4hiCD44v10+ T cells preceded EAE onset and paralleled disease severity in wild-type but not in CD44v7–/– and CD44v10–/– mice. CD44v7 and CD44v10 expression contributed to EAE by increasing the longevity of autoreactive CD4hi panCD44hi T cells. Accordingly, the absence of CD44v7 and CD44v10 led to increased apoptosis in the inflammatory infiltrates and reduced Th1 responses, resulting in marked disease reduction. Although absent in noninflamed human brains, we detected CD44v3, CD44v7, and CD44v10 isoforms on glial cells and on perivascular infiltrating cells of MS lesions. We conclude that CD44v7 and CD44v10, expressed on autoreactive CD4hipanCD44hi T cells, are critically involved in the pathogenesis of classic EAE by increasing their life span. Targeting these short CD44v isoform regions may reduce inflammatory processes and clinical symptoms in MS.—Ghazi-Visser, L., Laman, J.

https://openalex.org/W2005593244,"This paper presents a computational model to address one prominent psychological behavior of human beings to recognize images. The basic pursuit of our method can be concluded as that differences among multiple images help visual recognition. Generally speaking, we propose a statistical framework to distinguish what kind of image features capture sufficient category information and what kind of image features are common ones shared in multiple classes. Mathematically, the whole formulation is subject to a generative probabilistic model. Meanwhile, a discriminative functionality is incorporated into the model to interpret the differences among all kinds of images. The whole Bayesian formulation is solved in an Expectation-Maximization paradigm. After finding those discriminative patterns among different images, we design an image categorization algorithm to interpret how these differences help visual recognition within the bag-of-feature framework. The proposed method is verified on a variety of image categorization tasks including outdoor scene images, indoor scene images as well as the airborne SAR images from different perspectives."
https://openalex.org/W2093683138,"Low density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) was shown to mediate clearance of blood coagulation factor VIII (FVIII) from the circulation. To elucidate the mechanism of interaction of LDLR and FVIII, our objective was to identify the region of the receptor necessary for binding FVIII. Using surface plasmon resonance, we found that LDLR exodomain and its cluster of complement-type repeats (CRs) bind FVIII in the same mode. This indicated that the LDLR site for FVIII is located within the LDLR cluster. Similar results were obtained for another ligand of LDLR, α-2-macroglobulin receptor-associated protein (RAP), a common ligand of receptors from the LDLR family. We further generated a set of recombinant fragments of the LDLR cluster and assessed their structural integrity by binding to RAP and by circular dichroism. A number of fragments overlapping CR.2-5 of the cluster were positive for binding RAP and FVIII. The specificity of these interactions was tested by site-directed mutagenesis of conserved tryptophans within the LDLR fragments. For FVIII, the specificity was also tested using a single-chain variable antibody fragment directed against the FVIII light chain as a competitor.

FVIII serves as a cofactor for activated factor IX in the intrinsic pathway of blood coagulation, and deficiency in FVIII results in a bleeding disorder known as hemophilia A. This disease is treated by FVIII products, which require frequent infusions due to the short half-life of FVIII in plasma (∼14 h).

Point mutations of selected LDLR fragments were performed by overlapping PCR. All resulting PCR fragments were cloned into the modified pFastBac1 vector. Recombinant baculoviruses for the wild-type and mutant fragments of LDLR were generated using the plasmid constructs and the Bac-to-Bac expression system (Invitrogen). Optimization of the expression of the proteins in Sf9 cells was performed as described (38.Sarafanov A. Saenko E. High-throughput optimization of protein expression in the baculovirus system based on determination of relative expression efficiency of viral stocks.Anal. Biochem. 2004; 328: 98-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). The proteins were expressed in 120 ml of the suspension culture. The culture supernatants were harvested 72 h after infection and exchanged into PBS, pH 7.4, buffer using a tangential flow filter Pellicon XL 5k (Millipore, Billerica, MA). The fragments were then purified on nickel-Sepharose 6 Fast Flow resin (GE Healthcare). Upon adjusting the solutions to contain 300 mm NaCl, 20 mm imidazole, they were passed through the column followed by washing the resin with PBS, pH 7.4, 300 mm NaCl, 30 mm imidazole and eluting the proteins with PBS, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 230 mm imidazole. The eluted product was concentrated and further purified using size-exclusion chromatography on either Superdex-75 or Superdex-200 (GE Healthcare) to isolate the monomeric forms in 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 0.15 m NaCl, 0.005% Tween 20, and 5 mm CaCl2 (HBS/Ca). LDLR CR cluster (CR.1-7) and its mutant were refolded as described (29.Andersen O.M. Christensen L.L. Christensen P.A. Sørensen E.S. Jacobsen C. Moestrup S.K. Etzerodt M. Thogersen H.C.

All proteins were verified by PAGE with GelCode Blue Safe (Thermo Scientific) staining and Western blotting with anti-myc mAb9E10. The protein concentrations were measured by absorbance spectroscopy at 280 nm using calculated respective extinction coefficients. Far-UV CD measurements were performed on a Jasco J-815 spectropolarimeter (JASCO Co., Japan) at 25 ± 0.2 °C, as maintained by a PTC 423S/15 Peltier temperature controller (JASCO). The protein concentration in the samples was adjusted to ∼ 30 μm in HBS/Ca. Titration of the samples by EDTA was conducted stepwise by adding a calculated amount of the 0.5 m stock solution. The spectra were recorded between 180 and 260 nm in a 0.5-mm path length quartz cuvette using a scan speed of 20 nm/min, bandwidth of 1.0 nm, and resolution of 0.2 nm and accumulated in triplicate. An ellipticity of CD spectra was expressed in millidegrees. Prior to the measurements, FVIII products were reconstituted and dialyzed in a HBS/Ca buffer prepared by adjusting HBS-P buffer (GE Healthcare) to contain 5 mm of CaCl2. The concentration of the dialyzed FVIII was measured using a BCA kit (Thermo Scientific). Binding assays were performed in HBS-P/Ca using Biacore 3000 (GE Healthcare). LDLR fragments were immobilized on a CM5 chip using an amine coupling kit at ∼1000 resonance units for CR doublets and at ∼2000 resonance units for the CR cluster. Association of the fragments with RAP or with FVIII in the presence or absence of iKM33 was recorded at a flow rate of 10 μl/min for 3 min. The dissociations were recorded for 5 min in the running buffer. Regeneration of the sensors was performed by 0.1 m H3PO4. The estimated KD values were derived by fitting the association and dissociation curves with a 1:1 (Langmuir) model using the BIAevaluation 4.1.1 program. The generated LDLR fragments were its CR cluster and six overlapping CR doublets (FIGURE 1, FIGURE 2). This strategy was assumed suitable, based on its previous use for mapping the RAP-binding site on LRP (29.Andersen O.M. Christensen L.L. Christensen P.A. Sørensen E.S. Jacobsen C. Moestrup S.K.

The LDLR fragments obtained were essentially pure (Fig. 1); the observed double banding for some of the CR doublets was attributed to a possible difference in glycosylation, similar to that found previously for expressed fragments of LRP (31.Meijer A.B.

The inset shows an image of the GelCode Blue Safe-stained gel with the purified LDLR fragments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Because RAP is known to inhibit interactions of the LDLR family with their ligands in vitro, the integrity of the LDLR fragments was assessed by testing them for binding to RAP. As a control, we used the LDLR exodomain (full size), expressed in mammalian cells. In preliminary experiments, we found that the preparation of the LDLR cluster (of CRs) was less active for binding than some CR doublets, likely due to a higher content of the misfolded form. Chemical refolding of this preparation resulted in an increase of its binding activity; therefore, this approach was employed in further studies. In SPR, both the LDLR exodomain and its cluster bound RAP in a similar mode (Fig. 3, A and B). The assessed kinetic constants including both KD values (∼1 n"

The CDKN2A locus, which houses the INK4a and ARF tumor suppressor genes, is frequently altered in NSCLC. However, the specific role of ARF in pulmonary tumorigenesis remains unclear. KRAS and other oncogenes induce the expression of ARF, thus stabilizing p53 activity and arresting cell proliferation. To address the role of ARF in Kras-driven NSCLC, we compared the susceptibility of NIH/Ola strain wild-type and Arf-knockout mice to urethane-induced lung carcinogenesis. Lung tumor size, malignancy and associated morbidity were significantly increased in Arf−/− compared with Arf+/+ animals at 25 weeks after induction. Pulmonary tumors from Arf-knockout mice exhibited increased cell proliferation and DNA damage compared with wild-type mice. A subgroup of tumors in Arf−/− animals presented as dedifferentiated and metastatic, with many characteristics of pulmonary sarcomatoid carcinoma, a neoplasm previously undocumented in mouse models. Our finding of a role for ARF in NSCLC is consistent with the observation that benign adenomas from Arf+/+ mice robustly expressed ARF, while ARF expression was markedly reduced in malignant adenocarcinomas. ARF expression also frequently colocalized with the expression of p21CIP1, a transcriptional target of p53, arguing that ARF induces the p53 checkpoint to arrest cell proliferation in vivo. Taken together, these findings demonstrate that induction of ARF is an early response in lung tumorigenesis that mounts a strong barrier against tumor growth and malignant progression."

https://openalex.org/W2111301399,"Transposons permit permanent cellular genome engineering in vivo. However, transgene expression falls rapidly postdelivery due to a variety of mechanisms, including immune responses. We hypothesized that delaying initial transgene expression would improve long-term transgene expression by using an engineered piggyBac transposon system that can regulate expression. We found that a 2-part nonviral Tet-KRAB inducible expression system repressed expression of a luciferase reporter in vitro. However, we also observed nonspecific promoter-independent repression. Thus, to achieve temporary transgene repression after gene delivery in vivo, we utilized a nonintegrating version of the repressor plasmid while the gene of interest was delivered in an integrating piggyBac transposon vector. When we delivered the luciferase transposon and repressor to immunocompetent mice by hydrodynamic injection, initial luciferase expression was repressed by 2 orders of magnitude. When luciferase expression was followed long term in vivo, we found that expression was increased > 200-fold compared to mice that received only the luciferase transposon and piggyBac transposase. We found that repression of early transgene expression could prevent the priming of luciferase-specific T cells in vivo. Therefore, transient transgene repression postgene delivery is an effective strategy for inhibiting the antitransgene immune response and improving long-term expression in vivo without using immunosuppression.—Doherty, J.

https://openalex.org/W2009796271,"Odorants and pheromones are essential to insects as chemical cues for finding food or an appropriate mating partner. These volatile compounds bind to olfactory receptors (Ors) expressed by olfactory sensory neurons. Each insect Or functions as a ligand-gated ion channel and is a heteromeric complex that comprises one type of canonical Or and a highly conserved Orco subunit. Because there are many Or types, insect Ors can recognize with high specificity a myriad of chemical cues. Cyclic nucleotides can modulate the activity of insect Or-Orco complexes; however, the mechanism of action of these nucleotides is under debate. Here, we show that cyclic nucleotides, including cAMP and cGMP, interact with the silkmoth sex pheromone receptor complex, BmOr-1-BmOrco, from the outside of the cell and that these nucleotides act as antagonists at low concentrations and weak agonists at high concentrations. These cyclic nucleotides do not compete with the sex pheromone, bombykol, for binding to the BmOr-1 subunit. ATP and GTP also weakly inhibited BmOr-1-BmOrco activity, but D-ribose had no effect; these findings indicated that the purine moiety was crucial for the inhibition. Only the bombykol receptors have been so far shown to be subject to modulation by nucleotide-related compounds, indicating that this responsiveness to these compounds is not common for all insect Or-Orco complexes."

https://openalex.org/W2089148467,"The androgen receptor (AR) pathway plays critical roles in controlling differentiation and proliferation of prostate epithelial cells. We previously identified a novel AR cofactor, p44/WDR77, which specifically enhances AR transcriptional activity in the prostate gland and prostate cancer. To further elucidate p44/WDR77's role in the AR signaling pathway, we conducted a yeast two-hybrid screening and identified cGMP-dependent protein kinase (PKG) as a p44/WDR77-interacting protein. Further investigation by lusiferase assay and kinase assay demonstrated that PKG-Iβ physically interacted with and phosphorylated both p44 and AR and enhanced AR transactivity in synergy with p44 in an androgen- and cGMP-dependent manner. Furthermore, PKG1β expression promoted p44/WDR77 nuclear translocation and inhibited prostate cancer cell growth via G1 cell cycle arrest. Our findings characterize PKG as a novel regulator of AR-mediated transcription by enhancing AR cofactor p44/WDR77's function, which provide a novel mechanism for the growth regulation of prostate cancer cells by the androgen signaling."
https://openalex.org/W2042460081,"It has been recently shown that N-ras plays a preferential role in immune cell development and function; specifically: N-ras, but not H-ras or K-ras, could be activated at and signal from the Golgi membrane of immune cells following a low level T-cell receptor stimulus. The goal of our studies was to test the hypothesis that N-ras and H-ras played distinct roles in immune cells at the level of the transcriptome. First, we showed via mRNA expression profiling that there were over four hundred genes that were uniquely differentially regulated either by N-ras or H-ras, which provided strong evidence in favor of the hypothesis that N-ras and H-ras have distinct functions in immune cells. We next characterized the genes that were differentially regulated by N-ras in T cells following a low-level T-cell receptor stimulus. Of the large pool of candidate genes that were differentially regulated by N-ras downstream of TCR ligation, four genes were verified in qRT-PCR-based validation experiments (Dntt, Slc9a6, Chst1, and Lars2). Finally, although there was little overlap between individual genes that were regulated by N-ras in unstimulated thymocytes and stimulated CD4(+) T-cells, there was a nearly complete correspondence between the signaling pathways that were regulated by N-ras in these two immune cell types."
