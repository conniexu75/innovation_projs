https://openalex.org/W2151922790,"In Caenorhabditis elegans, lin-4 and let-7 encode 22- and 21-nucleotide (nt) RNAs, respectively, which function as key regulators of developmental timing. Because the appearance of these short RNAs is regulated during development, they are also referred to as small temporal RNAs (stRNAs). We show that many 21- and 22-nt expressed RNAs, termed microRNAs, exist in invertebrates and vertebrates and that some of these novel RNAs, similar to let-7 stRNA, are highly conserved. This suggests that sequence-specific, posttranscriptional regulatory mechanisms mediated by small RNAs are more general than previously appreciated."
https://openalex.org/W2167557255,"Two small temporal RNAs (stRNAs), lin-4 and let-7, control developmental timing in Caenorhabditis elegans. We find that these two regulatory RNAs are members of a large class of 21- to 24-nucleotide noncoding RNAs, called microRNAs (miRNAs). We report on 55 previously unknown miRNAs in C. elegans. The miRNAs have diverse expression patterns during development: a let-7 paralog is temporally coexpressed with let-7; miRNAs encoded in a single genomic cluster are coexpressed during embryogenesis; and still other miRNAs are expressed constitutively throughout development. Potential orthologs of several of these miRNA genes were identified in Drosophila and human genomes. The abundance of these tiny RNAs, their expression patterns, and their evolutionary conservation imply that, as a class, miRNAs have broad regulatory functions in animals."

To identify candidate molecular mediators of muscle atrophy, we performed transcript profiling. Although many genes were up-regulated in a single rat model of atrophy, only a small subset was universal in all atrophy models. Two of these genes encode ubiquitin ligases: Muscle RING Finger 1 (MuRF1), and a gene we designate Muscle Atrophy F-box (MAFbx), the latter being a member of the SCF family of E3 ubiquitin ligases. Overexpression of MAFbx in myotubes produced atrophy, whereas mice deficient in either MAFbx or MuRF1 were found to be resistant to atrophy. These proteins are potential drug targets for the treatment of muscle atrophy."
https://openalex.org/W1992941735,"The lin-4 and let-7 antisense RNAs are temporal regulators that control the timing of developmental events in Caenorhabditis elegans by inhibiting translation of target mRNAs. let-7 RNA is conserved among bilaterian animals, suggesting that this class of small RNAs [microRNAs (miRNAs)] is evolutionarily ancient. Using bioinformatics and cDNA cloning, we found 15 new miRNA genes in C. elegans. Several of these genes express small transcripts that vary in abundance during C. elegans larval development, and three of them have apparent homologs in mammals and/or insects. Small noncoding RNAs of the miRNA class appear to be numerous and diverse."
https://openalex.org/W2134351926,"Plant diversity and niche complementarity had progressively stronger effects on ecosystem functioning during a 7-year experiment, with 16-species plots attaining 2.7 times greater biomass than monocultures. Diversity effects were neither transients nor explained solely by a few productive or unviable species. Rather, many higher-diversity plots outperformed the best monoculture. These results help resolve debate over biodiversity and ecosystem functioning, show effects at higher than expected diversity levels, and demonstrate, for these ecosystems, that even the best-chosen monocultures cannot achieve greater productivity or carbon stores than higher-diversity sites."

We developed an individual farm-based stochastic model of the current UK epidemic. The fine grain of the epidemiological data reveals the infection dynamics at an unusually high spatiotemporal resolution. We show that the spatial distribution, size, and species composition of farms all influence the observed pattern and regional variability of outbreaks. The other key dynamical component is long-tailed stochastic dispersal of infection, combining frequent local movements with occasional long jumps. We assess the history and possible duration of the epidemic, the performance of control strategies, and general implications for disease dynamics in space and time."
https://openalex.org/W2006257247,"ErbB-4 is a transmembrane receptor tyrosine kinase that regulates cell proliferation and differentiation. After binding of its ligand heregulin (HRG) or activation of protein kinase C (PKC) by 12- O -tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA), the ErbB-4 ectodomain is cleaved by a metalloprotease. We now report a subsequent cleavage by γ-secretase that releases the ErbB-4 intracellular domain from the membrane and facilitates its translocation to the nucleus. γ-Secretase cleavage was prevented by chemical inhibitors or a dominant negative presenilin. Inhibition of γ-secretase also prevented growth inhibition by HRG. γ-Secretase cleavage of ErbB-4 may represent another mechanism for receptor tyrosine kinase–mediated signaling."

 review the evidence that global warming during the 20th century has affected the growth period of plants and the development and behavior of animals from insects to birds. The authors warn that changes in the interdependence between species could have unpredictable consequences for ecosystems, that the lengthening of the plant growing season contributes to the global increased carbon fixation, and that changes in phenology may affect not only ecosystems but also agriculture and sanitation."
https://openalex.org/W2116828898,"Turgor-driven plant cell growth depends on wall structure. Two allelic l -fucose–deficient Arabidopsis thaliana mutants ( mur1-1 and 1-2 ) are dwarfed and their rosette leaves do not grow normally. mur1 leaf cell walls contain normal amounts of the cell wall pectic polysaccharide rhamnogalacturonan II (RG-II), but only half exists as a borate cross-linked dimer. The altered structure of mur1 RG-II reduces the rate of formation and stability of this cross-link. Exogenous aqueous borate rescues the defect. The reduced cross-linking of RG-II in dwarf mur1 plants indicates that plant growth depends on wall pectic polysaccharide organization."
https://openalex.org/W2136012285,"α-Synuclein exists as at least two structural isoforms: a helix-rich, membrane-bound form and a disordered, cytosolic form. Here, we investigated the role of membrane-bound α-synuclein in the aggregation process. In a cell-free system consisting of isolated brain fractions, spontaneous and progressive aggregation of α-synuclein was observed in membranes starting at day 1, whereas no aggregation was observed in the cytosolic fraction in a 3-day period. The addition of antioxidants reduced the aggregation in the membrane fraction, implicating the role of oxidative modifications. When excess cytosolic α-synuclein was added to brain membranes, the rate of aggregation was increased, while the lag time was unaffected. Incorporation of cytosolic α-synuclein into membrane-associated aggregates was demonstrated by fractionation and co-immunoprecipitation experiments. In our recent study, we showed that mitochondrial inhibitors such as rotenone, induced α-synuclein aggregation in cells. In the present study using rotenone-treated cells, the earliest appearance of α-synuclein oligomeric species was observed in membranous compartments. Furthermore, α-synuclein-positive inclusions were co-stained with DiI, a membrane-partitioning fluorescent dye, confirming the presence of lipid components in α-synuclein aggregates. These results suggest that membrane-bound α-synuclein can generate nuclei that seed the aggregation of the more abundant cytosolic form. α-Synuclein exists as at least two structural isoforms: a helix-rich, membrane-bound form and a disordered, cytosolic form.

Lewy body phosphate-buffered saline amyloid β protein l-γ-glutamyl-l-cysteinyl ethyl glycinate α-Synuclein is a 140-amino acid protein that is highly expressed in the brain (1Ueda K. Fukushima H. Masliah E. Xia Y. Iwai A. Yoshimoto M. Otero D.A. Kondo J. Ihara Y. Saitoh T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 11282-11286Crossref PubMed Scopus (1228) Google Scholar). Although the precise function of this protein remains unknown, it has been proposed that α-synuclein is involved in synaptic transmission, based on the phenotype of the knock-out mice and its enrichment in presynaptic terminals (2Abeliovich A.

Subsequently, α-synuclein was identified in its fibrillar form as one of the major components of Lewy bodies (LBs)1 in Parkinson's disease and dementia with Lewy bodies (8Spillantini M.G.

The pathogenic role of α-synuclein was further confirmed from the study, showing that the transgenic overexpression of this protein in fly brains resulted in a loss of dopaminergic neurons and the formation of LB-like inclusion bodies (21Feany M.B. Bender W.W. Nature. 2000; 404: 394-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (1710) Google Scholar). Further studies with transgenic mice showed that overexpression of α-synuclein resulted in degenerative phenotypes, although some mice did not produce any apparent phenotype (22Masliah E.

Since the discovery of fibrillar α-synuclein in LBs, the fibrillization of recombinant α-synuclein has been studiedin vitro.

Consistent with the proposed role of the aggregated form of α-synuclein in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease, the disease-linked mutant forms tend to aggregate more rapidly than the wild type (30Conway K.A.

One of the central issues regarding the mechanism of the α-synuclein aggregation is how the “natively unfolded” protein is transformed to highly ordered fibrils that are rich in cross-β-sheet structure. A recent study showed evidence for a monomeric intermediate with a partially folded conformation in the fibrillization process (33Uversky V.N. Li J. Fink A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 10737-10744Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (936) Google Scholar), suggesting that the gain of partial structure at the initial stage constitutes a rate-limiting step. In vitro studies showed that α-synuclein binds to artificial liposomes of phospholipids with acidic head groups (34Davidson W.S. Jonas A. Clayton D.F. George J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9443-9449Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1251) Google Scholar, 35Jo E. McLaurin J. Yip C.M. St George-Hyslop P. Fraser P.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 34328-34334Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (504) Google Scholar). This binding seems to be mediated by seven imperfect repeats within the N-terminal half of the protein, which was proposed to form an amphipathic α-helix based on secondary structure predictions (36Clayton D.F. George J.M. Trends Neurosci. 1998; 21: 249-254Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (660) Google Scholar). Indeed, circular dichroism and nuclear magnetic resonance analyses demonstrated the structural transition from a random coil to an α-helix-rich conformation upon binding of α-synuclein to acidic phospholipid vesicles (34Davidson W.S.

Biol. 2001; 307: 1061-1073Crossref PubMed Scopus (861) Google Scholar). Furthermore, mutagenesis of individual exons of α-synuclein showed a correlation between the lipid-induced α-helical content and the degree of binding to vesicles (38Perrin R.J. Woods W.S. Clayton D.F. George J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 34393-34398Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar). Microscopic and fractionation studies showed that in cultured cells and brain tissue, a portion of α-synuclein is, indeed, associated with the membranous compartments (4George J.M. Jin H. Woods W.S. Clayton D.F. Neuron. 1995; 15: 361-372Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (730) Google Scholar, 39McLean P.J. Kawamata H. Ribich S. Hyman B.T. J. Biol.

These experiments suggested the presence of two structurally distinct populations of α-synuclein in cells: an α-helix-rich, membrane-bound form and a disordered, free cytosolic form. Here, using both cell-free and intact cell systems, we provide evidence that the membrane-bound form has a higher tendency to aggregate than the cytosolic form and that the aggregates formed in the membrane act as “seeds” to accelerate the aggregation of the free cytosolic α-synuclein. The fractionation procedure was based on Huttner et al. (41Huttner W.B. Schiebler W. Greengard P. De Camilli P. J. Cell Biol. 1983; 96: 1374-1388Crossref PubMed Scopus (890) Google Scholar). Frozen rat brains (∼5 g) were chopped to smaller pieces before the addition of 50 ml of ice-cold isolation buffer (320 mm sucrose, 4 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) containing a protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma) and were homogenized with a Teflon homogenizer. The homogenized sample was centrifuged at 1,000 ×g for 10 min. The pellet (P1) was discarded, and the supernatant (S1) was centrifuged at 11,500 × g for 15 min. The supernatant (S2) was saved until later in the procedure. The pellet (P2; crude synaptosomal fraction) was washed once with isolation buffer and centrifuged again. The pellet was resuspended with 10 ml of isolation buffer, and then 90 ml of ice-cold water was added for hypotonic lysis. It was then homogenized with the Teflon homogenizer to break synaptosomes to release synaptic vesicles. To the homogenized sample, 1 ml of 1 m Hepes, pH 7.4, was added and incubated on ice for 30 min before the centrifugation at 26,500 ×g for 20 min. The pellet (LP1) was resuspended in 12.5 ml of isolation buffer. The supernatant (LS1) was centrifuged again at 200,000 × g for 1 h to obtain pellet (LP2; crude synaptic vesicles) and supernatant (LS2). The S2 fraction was centrifuged at 200,000 × g for 40 min to obtain pellet (P3; microsomal vesicles) and supernatant (S3; cytosolic fraction). P3 and LP1 fractions (50 μg each) from above were incubated at room temperature for 4 h in isolation buffer (320 mm sucrose, 4 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, protease inhibitor mixture) with an increasing amount of NaCl, ranging from 0 to 800 mm. The tubes were then centrifuged at 200,000 × g (for P3) for 1 h or 26,500 ×g (for LP1) for 20 min. The pellets were resuspended in 1× Laemmli sample buffer. The final volume of the resuspended pellet material is the same as that of supernatant/1× Laemmli sample buffer. P3, LP1, and LP2 fractions (200 μg) were incubated in isolation buffer (in a total volume of 550 μl) at room temperature for up to 72 h, and 100-μl aliquots were removed at each time point. P3 and LP2 fractions were centrifuged at 200,000 × g for 30 min, and the LP1 fraction was centrifuged at 26,500 × g for 20 min. The pellet and the supernatant were saved for Western blot analysis (see below). For comparison of α−synuclein aggregation in membrane and cytosolic fractions, P3 and S3 were incubated in isolation buffer at room temperature for 0–3 days. The removed aliquots were then subjected to Western blot. In some experiments, glutathione monoethyl ester (1 mm; Calbiochem) or Trolox (1 mm; Calbiochem) was added in the reaction every day during the incubation. Western blotting was performed according to Lee et al. (42Lee S.-J. Liyanage U. Bickel P.E. Xia W. Lansbury Jr., P.T. Kosik K.S. Nat. Med. 1998; 4: 730-734Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar). Primary antibodies against α-synuclein used in this study were Syn-1 (BD Transduction Laboratories, San Diego, CA) and LB509 (Zymed Laboratories Inc., South San Francisco, CA). Anti-Rab4 and anti-γ-adaptin antibodies were purchased from BD Transduction Laboratories (San Diego, CA). Anti-calnexin antibody was purchased from StressGen Biotechnologies Corp. (Victoria, Canada). The vesicles were collected by a centrifugation at 200,000 × g for 30 min. The membrane pellets were prefixed with Karnovsky's fixative (4% paraformaldehyde, 2% glutaraldehyde, 0.1 m cacodylic acid, pH 7.4) at 4 °C for 12 h, suspended in cacodylate buffer (pH 7.4), and then postfixed with 1% osmium tetroxide for 2 h (43Karnovsky M.J. J. Cell Biol. 1965; 27 (abstr.): 137Google Scholar). Following dehydration, pellets were embedded in Epoxy, thin sectioned, stained with uranyl acetate and Reynolds lead citrate, and examined with a JEM-100CX-II electron microscope (Joel Ltd., Tokyo, Japan). Transformed African monkey kidney cell line COS-7 was maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (HyClone Laboratories Inc., Logan, UT) with 10% fetal bovine serum (HyClone Laboratories, Inc.) in a 37 °C/5% CO2 incubator. Construction of a recombinant adenoviral vector that contains human wild type α-synuclein cDNA, named adeno/α-syn, was described elsewhere. 2Lee, H.-J., Shin, S. Y., Choi, C., Lee, Y. H., and Lee, S.-J. (2002) J. Biol. Chem., in press. To express α-synuclein, COS-7 cells were split on 100-mm tissue culture dishes 1 day prior to infection to obtain ∼90% confluence on the day of infection. For infection, ∼1 × 108 plaque-forming units of adeno/α-syn in 1 ml of medium was added to each dish. After a 90-min incubation at 37 °C, 9 ml of fresh medium was added to the cells and incubated overnight. The next day, the medium was changed. For the induction of α-synuclein aggregation, the cells were treated with 0.1 μm rotenone for up to 3 days. For extraction of cytosolic α-synuclein, the cells were harvested in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) with protease inhibitors and passed through a cell cracker set up with a clearance of 12 μm (44Schmidt A. Huttner W.B. Methods. 1998; 16: 160-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The homogenate was centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 5 min. The supernatant was further centrifuged at 200,000 × g for 30 min, and the resulting supernatant was used as a cytosolic preparation. The P3 fraction (550 μg) was incubated with cytosol (150 μg) from adeno/vec- or adeno/α-syn-infected COS-7 cells at room temperature for 0–3 days. Aliquots removed at a given time were then subjected to Western blot analysis or flotation density gradient centrifugation. Membranous compartments were isolated from the P3/COS-7 cytosol mixture or 1,000 × g supernatant of COS-7 homogenate according to Volles et al. (45Volles M.J. Lee S.-J. Rochet J.C. Shtilerman M.D. Ding T.T. Kessler J.C. Lansbury Jr., P.T. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 7812-7819Crossref PubMed Scopus (617) Google Scholar). Samples were mixed with an equal volume of 60% iodixanol (Invitrogen). A discontinuous iodixanol gradient was prepared by injecting the samples into 30% iodixanol (400 μl) under the 25% iodixanol (2 ml) layer. Finally, 5% iodixanol (100 μl) was overlaid on top. Tubes were centrifuged at 200,000 × g for 2 h, and the top membrane fraction and bottom cytosolic fraction were collected for Western blot analysis. The P3 fraction (2.5 mg) was mixed with cytosol (500 μg) from α-synuclein-overexpressing COS-7 cells and incubated at room temperature for 0 or 3 days. Membranes were solubilized by adding 10% Triton X-100 to make a final 1% concentration and incubated on ice for 20 min before the addition of 3 μl of polyclonal anti-α-synuclein antibody, 66-8 (gift from Eliezer Masliah, University of California, San Diego), which recognizes an identical sequence of mouse and rat α-synuclein but not the human α-synuclein sequence. After 5 h of incubation at 4 °C with rotation, protein G-Sepharose beads (30 μl; Sigma) were added and incubated for another 1 h at 4 °C. The beads were then washed four times with RIPA buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.25% sodium deoxycholate, 1 mm EGTA) for 10 min each at 4 °C, and the proteins were eluted with 1× Laemmli sample buffer. The immunostaining procedure is described in Lee et al. (46Lee H.-J. Chun M. Kandror K.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 16597-16600Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells on coverslips were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS and permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS. Coverslips were blocked in blocking solution (PBS, 5% bovine serum albumin, 3% goat serum) for 30 min and incubated with LB509 in blocking solution for another 30 min. After extensive washing for 1–2 h in PBS, Cy2-conjugated goat secondary antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories Inc., West Grove, PA) in blocking solution was added for 30 min. For CM-DiI (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR) staining, the cells were incubated with 0.1 μg/ml CM-DiI at room temperature for 1 h. The final concentration of CM-DiI was achieved by diluting the stock solution (1 mg/ml in Me2SO) in PBS at 1:10,000. Then the cells were briefly washed with 10% glycerol and washed overnight in PBS at 4 °C (39McLean P.J. Kawamata H. Ribich S. Hyman B.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8812-8816Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). The nuclei were stained with Hoechst 33258 (2 μg/ml; Molecular Probes) in PBS for 10 min and washed three times with PBS for 30 min before mounting with Prolong anti-fade reagent (Molecular Probes). Images were analyzed using the DeltaVision deconvolution microscope (Applied Precision Inc., Issaquah, WA) in the Cell Science Imaging Facility at Stanford University. To characterize membrane-associated α-synuclein, rat brain homogenate was fractionated to several subcellular compartments. Consistent with previous reports (4George J.M. Jin H. Woods W.S. Clayton D.F. Neuron. 1995; 15: 361-372Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (730) Google Scholar, 40Irizarry M.C. Kim T.W. McNamara M. Tanzi R.E. George J.M. Clayton D.F. Hyman B.T. J. Neuropathol. Exp. Neurol. 1996; 55: 889-895Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar), α-synuclein was broadly distributed to all of the fractions, and a small proportion was co-fractionated with membranes (Fig.1). Based on a densitometric analysis, about 15% of α-synuclein in the S1 fraction was present in membrane fractions (P3, LP1, and LP2). Studies showed that α-synuclein preferentially binds to the phospholipid liposomes that contain acidic head groups (34Davidson W.S. Jonas A. Clayton D.F. George J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9443-9449Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1251) Google Scholar, 35Jo E. McLaurin J. Yip C.M. St George-Hyslop P. Fraser P.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 34328-34334Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (504) Google Scholar). To test the involvement of electrostatic force in the membrane interaction, P3 and LP1 membrane fractions were incubated in different salt concentrations, and the membranes were subsequently isolated by centrifugation. α-Synuclein remained bound to the membranes throughout the ionic strength range we tested, with no α-synuclein signal detected in the supernatant (Fig.2). Perrin et al. (38Perrin R.J. Woods W.S. Clayton D.F. George J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 34393-34398Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar) recently suggested that the interaction between hydrophobic residues of amphipathic α-helix and the membrane interior is important for the association of α-synuclein to the membrane. Our salt wash experiment agrees with this hydrophobic nature of the interaction. However, electrostatic interaction may be important for the initial contact of α-synuclein to the membrane, because high concentrations of salt decreased the degree of binding when added at the beginning of the liposome binding assay (35Jo E. McLaurin J. Yip C.M. St George-Hyslop P. Fraser P.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 34328-34334Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (504) Google Scholar). To assess the stability of the membrane-bound state of α-synuclein, brain membrane fractions were incubated at room temperature, and the off-rate of α-synuclein was measured by quantifying the level of free α-synuclein in the supernatant of 200,000 × gcentrifugation at different time points. In all three fractions tested (P3, LP1, and LP2), no free α-synuclein was detected at any time point up to 72 h, indicating little dissociation of α-synuclein from the membranes (Fig. 3). Although membrane binding by α-synuclein has been considered reversible largely due to its abundance in the cytosolic fraction, our results show that spontaneous dissociation of α-synuclein from the membrane is negligible. Interestingly, prolonged incubation of membrane fractions resulted in the aggregation of membrane-bound α-synuclein. All three fractions showed progressive accumulation of high molecular weight α-synuclein aggregates, which is accompanied by the reciprocal loss of monomers (Fig. 3). Our recent data showed that purified recombinant α-synuclein or human α-synuclein in a COS-7 cytosolic preparation did not form aggregates unless structural changes were induced in the protein by folding stresses, such as heat treatment. 3Uversky, V. N., Lee, H.-J., Li, J., Fink, A. L., and Lee, S.-J. (2001) J. Biol. Chem. 276,43495–43498. This observation prompted us to compare the aggregation tendency between the membrane-bound and cytosolic forms of α-synuclein from rat brain. P3 (microsomal vesicles) and S3 (cytosol) fractions were incubated at room temperature for up to 3 days, and the aggregation rate was compared. While the membrane-bound form produced high molecular weight aggregates, little aggregation was observed with cytosolic α-synuclein even after 3 days (Fig.4A). Aggregation of α-synuclein in the membrane is somewhat selective, because other peripheral membrane proteins such as γ-adaptin and Rab4 did not form aggregates in the same period of incubation (Fig. 4B). However, the aggregation is not exclusive to α-synuclein, because calnexin, a molecular chaperone with a transmembrane domain, underwent an extensive aggregation as well (Fig. 4B). Lipids with unsaturated fatty acyl chains are vulnerable to oxidation, and α-synuclein aggregates are known to be stabilized, if not promoted, by oxidative modifications (47Souza J.M. Giasson B.I. Chen Q. Lee V.M. Ischiropoulos H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 18344-18349Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (504) Google Scholar). To determine the role of oxidation, we examined the effect of antioxidants on the aggregation of membrane-bound α-synuclein. The addition of either glutathione monoethyl ester (GME; a membrane-permeable derivative of glutathione) or Trolox (water-soluble derivative of vitamin E) to the incubation drastically reduced the aggregation of α-synuclein (Fig. 5). This finding suggests that oxidative modifications in membrane lipids and/or α-synuclein promote the aggregation. To investigate possible morphological changes of the vesicles during the incubation, the vesicles in the P3 fraction were examined by electron microscopy. As shown in Fig. 6, no apparent morphological change was observed during the incubation or in the presence of GME. The vesicles were heterogeneous in size, ranging from 30 to 270 nm in diameter with a few multilamellar structures, but no significant change in vesicle size was found after incubation (Fig. 6, graph). This result suggests that the aggregation of α-synuclein in the membrane is not a secondary effect of vesicular alterations, such as membrane fusion or fragmentation. Since the majority of α-synuclein in the cells is in a free soluble state, cytosolic α-synuclein might play a critical role in the overall aggregation process, even if the aggregation is initiated by membrane-bound forms. To address the dynamic relationship between the membrane-bound and cytosolic forms in the aggregation process, the rat brain P3 fraction was mixed with a cytosolic preparation from COS-7 cells that expressed human α-synuclein, and the aggregation rate was compared with a mixture of P3 and control cytosol from empty vector-treated cells. To mimic thein vivo ratio, excess cytosolic α-synuclein (>6-fold, estimated based on the intensity of Western blot) was added to the membrane fraction. The lag time did not seem to differ significantly between the incubation with excess cytosolic α-synuclein and the incubation with control cytosol with"

The probabilities of individual association and dissociation events were greater for receptors at the anterior end of the cell. Agonist-induced receptor phosphorylation had little effect on any of the monitored properties, whereas G protein coupling influenced the binding kinetics. These observations illustrate the dynamic properties of receptors involved in gradient sensing and suggest that these may be polarized in chemotactic cells."

For the period 1955–96, sea level rise derived from tide gauge data agrees well with thermal expansion computed at the same locations. However, we find that subsampling the thermosteric sea level at usual tide gauge positions leads to a thermosteric sea level rise twice as large as the “true” global mean. As a possible consequence, the 20th century sea level rise estimated from tide gauge records may have been overestimated."

https://openalex.org/W2014438192,"In response to DNA damage, eukaryotic cells activate checkpoint pathways that arrest cell cycle progression and induce the expression of genes required for DNA repair. In budding yeast, the homothallic switching (HO) endonuclease creates a site-specific double-strand break at the mating type (MAT) locus. Continuous HO expression results in the phosphorylation of Rad53, which is dependent on products of the ataxia telangiectasia mutated-related MEC1 gene and other checkpoint genes, including DDC1, RAD9, and RAD24. Chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments revealed that the Ddc1 protein associates with a region near the MAT locus after HO expression. Ddc1 association required Rad24 but not Mec1 or Rad9. Mec1 also associated with a region near the cleavage site after HO expression, but this association is independent of Ddc1, Rad9, and Rad24. Thus, Mec1 and Ddc1 are recruited independently to sites of DNA damage, suggesting the existence of two separate mechanisms involved in recognition of DNA damage."

In previous work, we have shown that CYP2C9is inducible in primary human hepatocytes by xenobiotics including dexamethasone, rifampicin, and phenobarbital. The aim of this work was to investigate the molecular mechanism(s) controlling the inducible expression of CYP2C9. Deletional analysis ofCYP2C9 regulatory region (+21 to −2088) in the presence of various hormone nuclear receptors suggested the presence of two functional response elements, a glucocorticoid receptor-responsive element (−1648/−1684) and a constitutive androstane receptor-responsive element (CAR, −1783/−1856). Each of these were characterized by co-transfection experiments, directed mutagenesis, gel shift assays, and response to specific antagonists RU486 and androstanol. By these experiments we located a glucocorticoid-responsive element imperfect palindrome at −1662/−1676, and a DR4 motif at −1803/−1818 recognized and transactivated by human glucocorticoid receptor and by hCAR and pregnane X receptor, respectively. Identification of these functional elements provides rational mechanistic basis for CYP2C9induction by dexamethasone (submicromolar concentrations), and by phenobarbital and rifampicin, respectively.

CYP2C9 is a member of the CYP2C subfamily, which in man includes at least three other members, i.e. CYP2C8, CYP2C18, and CYP2C19 (1Goldstein J.A. de Morais S. Pharmacogenetics. 1994; 4: 285-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (519) Google Scholar). Accumulating evidence indicates that CYPC9 ranks second, after CYP3A4, among the most expressed drug-metabolizing enzymes in human liver (2Miners J.O. Birkett D.J. Br. J. Clin. Pharmacol. 1998; 45: 525-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (761) Google Scholar). CYP2C9 is involved in the metabolism of numerous substrates including phenytoin, tolbutamide, torsemide, S-warfarin, and numerous nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (reviewed in Refs. 1Goldstein J.A. de Morais S. Pharmacogenetics. 1994; 4: 285-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (519) Google Scholar and 2Miners J.O. Birkett D.J. Br. J. Clin. Pharmacol. 1998; 45: 525-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (761) Google Scholar). In contrast to the large amount of data on the biochemistry, enzymology, pharmacology, and genetic polymorphism of CYP2C9, little is known on the inducibility of this gene in response to xenobiotics in humans. We recently demonstrated that CYP2C9 is inducible at the mRNA and protein levels in human hepatocytes in primary cultures in response to xenobiotics shown previously to beCYP3A4 and CYP2B6 inducers such as dexamethasone, rifampicin, and phenobarbital (3Gerbal-Chaloin S.

The concentration and time dependence of CYP2C9 mRNA expression in response to these three inducers, compared with those of CYP3A4 and CYP2B6 mRNAs, were consistent with the possible implication of at least three receptors in the inducible expression of CYP2C9: the glucocorticoid receptor (GR), the pregnane X receptor (PXR, also named steroid and xenobiotic receptor and pregnane-activated receptor), and the constitutive androstane receptor (CAR), respectively (3Gerbal-Chaloin S.

PXR forms a heterodimer with RXR, and this complex has been shown to activateCYP3A4 transcription through binding to an ER6 element present at position −160 in the proximal promoter (8Lehmann J.M. McKee D.D. Watson M.A. Willson T.M. Moore J.T. Kliewer S.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 102: 1016-1023Crossref PubMed Scopus (1389) Google Scholar). More recently, Goodwin et al. (11Goodwin B. Hodgson E. Liddle C. Mol. Pharmacol. 1999; 56: 1329-1339Crossref PubMed Scopus (592) Google Scholar) reported the presence of a distal element called xenobiotic responsive enhancer module (XREM) harboring both a DR3 and an ER6 motif, located at −7 kb, and they demonstrated that this element cooperates with the proximal ER6 to activateCYP3A4 transcription. PXR is activated by numerous compounds known to induce CYP3A expression, such as rifampicin, phenobarbital, clotrimazole, and dexamethasone (12Moore L.B. Parks D.J. Jones S.A. Bledsoe R.K. Consler T.G. Stimmel J.B. Goodwin B. Liddle C. Blanchard S.G. Willson T.M. Collins J.L. Kliewer S.A. J. Biol.

The apparentKd values of these compounds for the human PXR are in the micromolar (rifampicin, clotrimazole) or supramicromolar (phenobarbital, dexamethasone) range. In contrast to PXR, CAR is sequestered in the cytosol and translocates into the nucleus upon activation, notably in response to phenobarbital (13Honkakoski P. Negishi M. Biochem. J. 1998; : 889-895Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), presumably through several steps of phosphorylation (14Kawamoto T. Sueyoshi T. Zelko I. Moore R. Washburn K. Negishi M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 6318-6322Crossref PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar). Like PXR, CAR forms a heterodimer with RXR. Several groups have identified a complex phenobarbital-responsive element module in CYP2B genes (15Park Y. Li H. Kemper B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23725-23728Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar,16Trottier E. Belzil A. Stoltz C. Anderson A.

Chem. 1997; 272: 14943-14949Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). The active element called NR1 is located at position −1663/−1683 in CYP2B6 and exhibits a DR4 motif (5Sueyoshi T. Kawamoto T. Zelko I. Honkakoski P. Negishi M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 6043-6046Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (627) Google Scholar). Only a few molecules among CYP inducers were shown to bind directly to human CAR. These include androstenol (and related compounds at supramicromolar concentrations), and clotrimazole or 5β-pregnane-3,20-dione (in the micromolar range). However, both androstenol and clotrimazole appear to be deactivators instead of activators of hCAR, whereas 5β-pregnane-3,20-dione appears as a true activator.

The aim of the present work was to investigate the molecular mechanism(s) of induction of CYP2C9 by dexamethasone, rifampicin, and phenobarbital. For this purpose, the 5′-flanking region of this gene was analyzed between +21 and −2088 by several tests, including transcriptional analysis of deletion fragments, co-transfection with nuclear receptor expression plasmids, directed mutagenesis, and gel shift assays. Our results suggest the existence of two functional responsive elements in the regulatory region ofCYP2C9: an imperfect palindromic glucocorticoid-responsive element (GRE) at −1662/−1676 and a CAR-responsive element (DR4) at −1803/−1818.

They were then cloned into pGL3-basic digested with BglII/KpnI. Oligonucleotides corresponding to 2C9-GRE (5′-ACCCAACTGAACTGAATGTTTTGCTTGAA-3′) and 2C9-DR4 (5′-AAACCAAACTCTTCTGACCTCTCA-3′) were cloned into pGL3 promoter digested with SmaI.

Pharmacol. 1999; 56: 1329-1339Crossref PubMed Scopus (592) Google Scholar). Samples were loaded on a 4% polyacrylamide gel and submitted to electrophoresis at 20 mA in 0.25× TBE. The gel was analyzed using a PhosphorImager apparatus and ImageQuant software. Total RNA was isolated using Trizol reagent (Invitrogen), from 107 cultured hepatocytes according to the manufacturer's instructions. For quality control, 30 μg of total RNA were analyzed by Northern blot using a rat glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase cDNA probe (J. M. Blanchard, IGMM, Montpellier France). Tyrosine aminotransferase (TAT) mRNA was quantified by Northern blot using a specific probe (kindly provided by Dr. T. Grange, Institut J. Monod, Paris, France), and CYP2C9 mRNA was quantified by RNase protection assay as described (3Gerbal-Chaloin S. Pascussi J.M. Pichard-Garcia L. Daujat M. Waechter F. Fabre J.M. Carrere N. Maurel P. Drug Metab. Dispos. 2001; 29: 242-251PubMed Google Scholar). In recent work, we observed that induction of CYP2C9 mRNA by dexamethasone paralleled that of TAT, a gene product known to be controlled by GR (18Schmid E. Schmid W. Jantzen M. Mayer D. Jastorff B. Schutz G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1987; 165: 499-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar) in terms of time and concentration dependence in primary human hepatocytes (3Gerbal-Chaloin S. Pascussi J.M. Pichard-Garcia L. Daujat M. Waechter F. Fabre J.M. Carrere N. Maurel P. Drug Metab. Dispos. 2001; 29: 242-251PubMed Google Scholar). This prompted us to look for a functional glucocorticoid-responsive element (GRE) in gene CYP2C9. For this purpose, the 5′-flanking region of CYP2C9 from −2088 to +21 was cloned upstream of a luciferase reporter gene driven by a SV40 promoter in pGL3 basic vector (p2088-luc), and several plasmids containing deletion constructs of this region were generated. The various plasmids harboring CYP2C9 deletions were transfected into HepG2 cells (in which GR expression is very low), with or without cotransfection of a plasmid expressing hGR (pSG5-hGR). Cells were then cultured for 16 h in the presence or absence of dexamethasone, and luciferase activity was measured. Plasmid pTAT-GRE-TK-luc harboring one GRE from TAT was used as control. As shown in Fig. 1, both p2088-luc and pTAT-GRE-TK-luc exhibited parallel response to increasing concentrations of dexamethasone (a plateau being reached at 10 nm) and similar extent of induction (15-fold). As these results suggested the presence of a GRE located on the −2088/+21 region of CYP2C9, a more detailed analysis of hGR-mediated transactivation of CYP2C9 deletion constructs was undertaken. The results are presented in Fig.2. No significant induction of the reporter gene was observed (2-fold induction maximum) without hGR transfection in any of the constructs examined, including the empty pGL3 basic vector. In contrast, when these plasmids were cotransfected with the hGR expression vector, a significant induction (10–20-fold) was observed in response to 100 nm dexamethasone for p2088-luc, p1856-luc, p1783-luc, and p1684-luc constructs. However, a major decrease in luciferase activity was observed with construct p1648-luc and shorter constructs including p1545-luc and p340-luc. These results suggest the existence of a GRE between −1684 and −1648.Figure 2Identification of a functional GRE in theCYP2C9 promoter.Left panel, schematic representation of CYP2C9promoter constructs (from −2088 to +21). Right panel, transactivation of CYP2C9 promoter constructs by hGR. Plasmids harboring the CYP2C9 promoter constructs were cotransfected in HepG2 cells with pSG5 (control vector,white bars) or pSG5-hGR (hGR-expressing vector,black bars), and with pSV-β-galactosidase for transfection control. hGR was activated by treatment of cells with 100 nm dexamethasone for 16 h. Cell extracts were assayed for luciferase activity, which was normalized to β-galactosidase activity. Induction is expressed as the ratio of normalized luciferase activity in the presence of DEX to this activity in the absence of DEX.Error bars represent the standard deviations of 10 independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) An oligonucleotide corresponding to the region −1684 to −1654 was then cloned in three copies in the pGL3-promoter to generate plasmid p2C9-(GRE)3-luc. As shown in Fig.3A, this construct was strongly transactivated by hGR (150-fold) in the presence of 100 nm dexamethasone. To verify that this transactivation was hGR-dependent, cells were treated with 1 μmRU486 (a prototypical hGR antagonist), in the absence or presence of dexamethasone. Although RU486 per se produced a moderate induction of luciferase activity, this compound drastically inhibited the dexamethasone-mediated transactivation of the construct. The full-length 2C9 promoter responded only modestly to dexamethasone when transfected in hepatocytes under the same conditions (data not shown). In parallel experiments carried out with plasmid pTAT-(GRE)2-TK-luc, similar observations were made (Fig.3B). Plasmid p2C9-(GRE)3-luc was also transfected in primary human hepatocytes and was transactivated by 100 nm dexamethasone as shown in Fig. 3C. Here again, RU486 completely suppressed dexamethasone-mediated transactivation. Computer analysis of theCYP2C9−1684/−1654 region demonstrated the presence of two putative GRE half-sites separated by three nucleotides. To evaluate the role of these two sites, they were mutated sequentially by directed mutagenesis using p2088-luc as a template (Fig.4A). Plasmids p2088-GREwt-luc (wild type GRE sequence), p2088-GREm1-luc (mutations in the 5′-half-site of GRE), and p2088-GREm2-luc (mutations in the 3′-half-site of GRE) were then transfected in HepG2 cells in the presence of hGR expression vector and of 100 nmdexamethasone. As shown in Fig. 4B, the mutation of either half-site was sufficient to abolish transcriptional activation of the construct. The CYP2C9 region −1662/−1676 is hereafter referred to as 2C9-GRE. To determine whether hGR interacts directly with 2C9-GRE, a gel shift analysis was performed using baculovirus-expressed hGR. In a control experiment (Fig. 5A), we verified that the consensus TAT-GRE effectively binds hGR. A clear band revealing the complex was observed (lane 2), and this band was supershifted by anti-GR antibodies, as expected (lane 3). TAT-GRE oligonucleotide efficiently competed with itself (lanes 4 and 5), whereas the TAT-GRE mutant (see “Experimental Procedures”) did not (lane 6). 2C9-GRE oligonucleotide was a modest competitor for this binding (lanes 7 and 8), whereas the mutant 2C9-GREm3 (mutations in both half-sites of GRE, see “Experimental Procedures”) was not (lane 9). Similar experiments carried out with 2C9-GRE are shown in Fig. 5B. The efficient binding of hGR to 2C9-GRE is revealed by a clear band (lane 2); this band was supershifted by anti-hGR antibodies (lane 3). TAT-GRE in excess efficiently competed with this binding (lanes 4 and5), whereas mutated TAT-GRE did not (lane 6). These observations suggest that 2C9-GRE binds to hGR, although with a lower affinity than for TAT-GRE. hGR is expressed constitutively in our hepatocyte cultures (19Pascussi J.M. Drocourt L. Fabre J.M. Maurel P. Vilarem M.J. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 58: 361-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar, 20Pascussi J.M. Gerbal-Chaloin S. Fabre J.M. Maurel P. Vilarem M.J. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 58: 1441-1450Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). We therefore anticipated that, if induction of CYP2C9 mRNA by dexamethasone is primarily mediated by hGR, protein synthesis should not be necessary for this process. To test this hypothesis, human hepatocytes were cultured in a dexamethasone-depleted medium for 48 h and then re-exposed to 100 nm dexamethasone for 24 h, either in the absence or presence of 10 μg/ml cycloheximide, a typical inhibitor of protein synthesis (control experiments indicated that protein synthesis is inhibited by more than 90% in these conditions). Analysis of CYP2C9 mRNA expression by RNase protection assay is reported in Fig.6. Clearly, cycloheximide affected neither CYP2C9 nor TAT mRNA induction by dexamethasone. In contrast, induction of CYP2C9 mRNA by rifampicin and phenobarbital was inhibited by 50% and by more than 75%, respectively, in cells cultured in the presence of cycloheximide. Similarly, induction of CYP3A4 mRNA by rifampicin was inhibited by more than 75% in cycloheximide-treated cells (not shown). In aggregate, our previous studies (3Gerbal-Chaloin S. Pascussi J.M. Pichard-Garcia L. Daujat M. Waechter F. Fabre J.M. Carrere N. Maurel P. Drug Metab. Dispos. 2001; 29: 242-251PubMed Google Scholar), the data reported above on CYP2C9-GRE characterization, and the absence of any effect of cycloheximide on mRNA induction demonstrate that CYP2C9 is a primary hGR-responsive gene, in cultured human hepatocytes. We have previously observed that induction of CYP2C9 mRNA in response to phenobarbital in primary human hepatocytes parallels that of CYP2B6 mRNA in terms of time and concentration dependence (3Gerbal-Chaloin S. Pascussi J.M. Pichard-Garcia L. Daujat M. Waechter F. Fabre J.M. Carrere N. Maurel P. Drug Metab. Dispos. 2001; 29: 242-251PubMed Google Scholar). It was therefore suspected that CAR could account for the phenobarbital-mediated induction of CYP2C9. We looked for possible CAR-responsive element(s) in theCYP2C9 regulatory region by deletion analysis of transcriptional activity. The plasmids harboring the variousCYP2C9 deletion constructs described above were transfected into HuH7 cells, with or without cotransfection of a plasmid expressing either the mouse or human CAR (mCAR or hCAR). Cells were then cultured for 36 h and the luciferase activity measured. Plasmid p2B6-(NR1)3-luc, harboring"

Recently, three genes responsible for inherited forms of PD have been identified. Mutations in the genes encoding α-synuclein and ubiquitin C-terminal hydrolase L1 (UCH-L1) each cause rare autosomal dominant forms of PD (1Polymeropoulos M.H. Lavedan C. Leroy E. Ide S.E. Dehejia A.

In contrast, mutations in the gene encoding parkin cause an autosomal recessive, juvenile-onset form of PD and account for more cases of PD than all other familial causes combined (3Kitada T.

Further, Lewy bodies, the cytoplasmic inclusions that constitute the pathological hallmark of the disease, contain α-synuclein, UCH-L1 and parkin deposits even in sporadic cases, suggesting a broader role for these three genes in PD (2Leroy E. Boyer R. Auburger G. Leube B. Ulm G. Mezey E. Harta G. Brownstein M.J. Jonnalagada S. Chernova T. Dehejia A. Lavedan C. Gasser T. Steinbach P.J. Wilkinson K.D. Polymeropoulos M.H.

Science. 2001; 293: 263-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (955) Google Scholar). Interestingly however, Lewy bodies do not occur in the brains of patients with familial PD caused by parkin mutations, implicating parkin in the biogenesis of these inclusions (3Kitada T. Asakawa S. Hattori N. Matsumine H. Yamamura Y. Minoshima S. Yokochi M. Mizuno Y. Shimizu N. Nature. 1998; 392: 605-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (4231) Google Scholar). Another major component of Lewy bodies is ubiquitin (Ub), a small protein that can be covalently attached to other proteins (7Kuzuhara S. Mori H. Izumiyama N. Yoshimura M. Ihara Y. Acta Neuropathol. 1988; 75: 345-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). Conjugation of Ub onto proteins requires the concerted activity of three enzymes, an E1 Ub-activating enzyme, an E2 Ub-conjugating enzyme, and an E3 Ub-ligase. Ubiquitinated proteins are then targeted for degradation by the 26 S proteasome. The ubiquitin proteasome pathway (UPP) is one of the main pathways for protein degradation and has been implicated in a number of important cellular regulatory processes (8Hershko A. Ciechanover A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 425-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (6959) Google Scholar). There is considerable evidence that parkin also functions in the UPP. Indeed, the N terminus of parkin shares homology with ubiquitin (Ub-like domain or Ubl) and its C terminus contains RING domains, a structural feature shared by a large, otherwise divergent, family of E3 Ub-ligases. E3 Ub-ligases are involved in recognizing protein substrates and thereby regulating and conferring specificity to ubiquitination (9Joazeiro C.A. Weissman A.M. Cell. 2000; 102: 549-552Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1051) Google Scholar). Importantly, several groups have now shown that parkin functions as an E3 Ub-ligase by coordinating the E2-dependent transfer of Ub to target proteins (10Shimura H. Hattori N. Kubo S. Mizuno Y.

Dawson T.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 13354-13359Crossref PubMed Scopus (842) Google Scholar). Thus, parkin-mediated ubiquitination and targeting of substrates to the proteasome for degradation could regulate their levels within the cell. Further, defects in parkin-mediated ubiquitination could result in the accumulation of potentially toxic substrates, leading to neurodegeneration. Identifying the substrates of parkin-mediated ubiquitination may therefore provide insight into the mechanisms of dopamine neuron degeneration in PD. Such critical substrates may be enriched within the same subcellular compartment as parkin. Interestingly, we noticed that the sequence at the extreme C terminus of parkin contains a potential postsynaptic density-95, disc large, zona occludens (PDZ) binding motif, suggesting it could interact with PDZ proteins. PDZ proteins are involved in targeting, clustering, and assembling multiprotein signaling complexes at the postsynaptic density (PSD) (12Sheng M. Sala C. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2001; 24: 1-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (1049) Google Scholar). PDZ domains contain a conserved peptide-binding groove that interacts with the extreme C terminus of ligands. PDZ domains have been categorized into three classes based on target sequence specificity. Class I PDZ domains bind (S/T)X(V/I/L), class II PDZ domains bind -Φ−X-Φ (where Φ is a hydrophobic residue) and class III PDZ domains bind (D/E)X(V/L) peptide sequences (12Sheng M. Sala C. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2001; 24: 1-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (1049) Google Scholar). The sequence FDV at the C terminus of parkin corresponds to a class II PDZ binding motif. Interestingly, a familial PD-causing mutation, truncating parkin at tryptophan 453, just 12 amino acids from this PDZ binding motif, but leaving the RING domains involved in E3 Ub-ligase activity intact (4Lucking C.B. Durr A. Bonifati V. De Vaughan J. Michele G. Gasser T. Harhangi B.S. Meco G. Denefle P. Wood N.W. Agid Y. Brice A. N. Engl. J.

We report here that parkin is found in a Triton X-100-resistant compartment of the synaptic plasma membrane, similarly to many PDZ-associated proteins. Further, the C terminus of parkin specifically binds to the class II PDZ protein CASK, the mammalian homolog of Caenorhabditis elegans Lin-2 (13Hsueh Y.P. Yang F.C. Kharazia V. Naisbitt S. Cohen A.R.

Further, parkin also associates with a large multimeric protein complex implicated in NMDA receptor signaling at the PSD. Importantly, these data suggest novel functions for parkin in synaptic transmission as well as neurodegeneration. The entire parkin coding region was PCR-amplified from a PC12 cDNA library (gift of Dr. Steven Morris, MNI) and subcloned into the EcoRI andNotI sites of pcDNA 3.1 (Invitrogen). The glutathione-S-transferase (GST)·Ubl-(1–103), GST·CT-(441–465), and GST·V/E-(441–465) fusion proteins were prepared by PCR amplifying and subcloning the corresponding fragments into pGEX-5X-1 (Amersham Biosciences). GST·NR2B was a gift from Dr. David Bredt (UCSF). The parkin antibody ASP5p was described previously (15Gu W.J. Abbas N. Lagunes M.Z. Parent A. Pradier L. Bohme G.A. Agid Y. Hirsch E.C. Raisman-Vozari R. Brice A. J. Neurochem. 2000; 74: 1773-1776Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The anti-Ubl parkin antibody was raised in rabbit against the GST·Ubl fusion protein. The monoclonal synapsin antibody was a gift from Dr. Peter McPherson (MNI). The monoclonal Thy1.1 antibody was a gift from Dr. Erik Schweitzer (UCLA). Polyclonal antibodies to PICKI, GRIP1, and GRIP2 were a gift from Dr. Richard Huganir (Johns Hopkins). The polyclonal parkin antibody for immunocytochemistry was from Chemicon. Monoclonal synaptophysin, MAP2, and FLAG antibodies were from Sigma. The monoclonal anti-His antibody was from Novagen. Monoclonal PSD-95, CASK, flotillin, CAMKIIα, MUPP1, Homer1a, neurexin I, NR2B, GRIP, neurabin, and α-synuclein antibodies were from Transduction Laboratories. Synaptosomes from whole rat brain were prepared by differential centrifugation as described (16Huttner W.B. Schiebler W. Greengard P. De Camilli P. J. Cell Biol. 1983; 96: 1374-1388Crossref PubMed Scopus (894) Google Scholar). This yielded non-synaptic (P3, S3) and synaptosomal (P2) fractions. P2 was further fractionated into plasma membrane (LP1)-, synaptic vesicle (LP2)-, and cytosol (LS2)-enriched fractions. Synaptic plasma membrane (SPM) was prepared from LP1 using a discontinuous sucrose density gradient as described (17Jones D.H. Matus A.I. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1974; 356: 276-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (550) Google Scholar). Briefly, LP1 was brought to 1.1 m sucrose and placed under a 0.8m/0.3 m sucrose step-gradient and centrifuged at 65,000 × g for 2.5 h. The SPM was recovered from the 0.8/1.1 m interface. Synaptic vesicles (SVs) were purified from LP2 by centrifugation at 120,000 × g for 4 h through a 50–800 mm linear sucrose density gradient, as described (16Huttner W.B. Schiebler W. Greengard P. De Camilli P. J. Cell Biol. 1983; 96: 1374-1388Crossref PubMed Scopus (894) Google Scholar). Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE, blotted onto nitocellulose, incubated with the indicated antibodies and imaged with enhanced chemiluminescence (Pierce). Rafts were isolated as described (18Bruckner K. Pablo Labrador J. Scheiffele P. Herb A. Seeburg P.H. Klein R. Neuron. 1999; 22: 511-524Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar), with the following modifications. P2 was first purified on a discontinuous sucrose gradient (0.8 to 1.1 m) and pelleted at 100,000 × g for 1 h, followed by incubation in ice-cold 1% Triton X-100 for 20 min. The samples were adjusted to 40% sucrose, overlaid with a 30/0% sucrose step-gradient, centrifuged at 158,000 × g for 16 h, and equal volume fractions were collected from the bottom of the gradient. PSDs were isolated as described (13Hsueh Y.P. Yang F.C. Kharazia V. Naisbitt S. Cohen A.R. Weinberg R.J. Sheng M. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 139-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). Briefly, the purified P2 pellet was extracted in ice-cold 0.5% Triton X-100/50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.9) and centrifuged at 32,000 × g to obtain PSD I. PSD I was extracted a second time with either 0.5% Triton X-100 (PSD II) or with 3% sarkosyl (PSD III), followed by centrifugation at 200,000 × g for 1 h. Cortical neurons were isolated from the telecephalon of E16 mice (Charles River, Canada), triturated, and plated on poly-d-lysine-coated coverslips in Neurobasal medium supplemented with 0.5× N2, 0.5× B27 (Invitrogen), 100 μg/ml penicillin/streptomycin, and 2 mm glutamine. After 6 daysin vitro, the coverslips were fixed in methanol for 10 min at −20 °C, blocked with 10% bovine serum albumin/phosphate-buffered saline and incubated with primary antibodies in 3% bovine serum albumin/phosphate-buffered saline for 1 h followed by secondary fluorochrome-conjugated antibodies for 1 h. Antibody concentrations: synaptophysin, 1:1000, MAP2, 1:800, CASK, 1:100, parkin (Chemicon), 1:1200. CY2-conjugated goat anti-mouse, and CY3-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit (Jackson Immunoresearch), 1:800. Slides were imaged using a Zeiss Axioskop microscope (Oberkochen, Germany) with a 100 × objective, using Northern Eclipse software. GST fusion proteins were expressed inEscherichia coli and immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose beads. For pull-downs, synaptosomes (P2) were solubilized with 1% deoxycholate, 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) at 37 °C and cleared by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 30 min. The supernatants (12 mg of protein) were incubated with immobilized GST fusion proteins overnight at 4 °C. The beads were washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline, and bound proteins were eluted with sample buffer at 65 °C. For immunoprecipitation, synaptosomes were solubilized as above, the supernatant (1 mg of protein) was brought to 1% Triton X-100/50 mm Tris-HCl and precleared for 1 h with protein A-Sepharose. Antibody was added to the supernatant and incubated overnight at 4 °C. The samples were incubated with protein A-Sepharose for 2 h, washed three times with 0.1% Triton X-100, 50 mm Tris-HCl, and bound proteins were eluted with sample buffer at 65 °C. For ubiquitination assays, immunoprecipitated parkin was resuspended in 50 μl of buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 2.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 4 mm ATP, 10 μg of His-Ub (Sigma), 100 ng of human E1, and 2.4 μg of UbcH7 as an E2 (both from Affiniti Research). Reactions were incubated for 90 min at room temperature, terminated by adding SDS sample buffer, resolved by SDS-PAGE, and immunoblotted with anti-His and anti-CASK antibodies. We used differential centrifugation to determine the subcellular localization of parkin in rat brain. Immunoblotting of the fractions with the anti-parkin antibody ASP5p, reveals that parkin occurs in both synaptic (P2) and non-synaptic (P3) fractions (Fig. 1A). Interestingly, at the synapse, parkin is highly enriched in membrane (LP1 and LP2) compared with cytosolic (LS2) fractions. Indeed, parkin co-fractionates with the AMPA receptor subunit GluR2/3, a plasma membrane marker, and synaptophysin, a synaptic vesicle (SV) marker, but not with α-synuclein, which is predominantly a cytosolic presynaptic protein (Fig. 1A). Finding that parkin co-sediments with particulate LP1 and LP2 fractions suggested that it is present in a synaptic membrane compartment. These fractions are however of relatively low purity and provide only crude localization information. To identify more precisely the subcellular localization of parkin, we used sucrose density gradient fractionation to further purify SPM and SVs from LP1 and LP2 respectively. In these purified preparations, parkin co-fractionates with the SPM markers GluR2/3 and Thy-1 (Fig.1B) but not with the SV markers, synaptophysin, or synapsin (Fig. 1C). Interestingly, a recent report describes co-fractionation of parkin with SV markers, using different fractionation conditions (19Kubo Si S. Kitami T. Noda S. Shimura H. Uchiyama Y. Asakawa S. Minoshima S. Shimizu N. Mizuno Y. Hattori N. J. Neurochem. 2001; 78: 42-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). We find that parkin does not associate with SVs, an observation that is unlikely to result from fractionation conditions that removed parkin from SVs. Indeed, even small amounts of salt in the fractionation buffer readily remove certain SV proteins such as synapsin from SVs (16Huttner W.B. Schiebler W. Greengard P. De Camilli P. J. Cell Biol. 1983; 96: 1374-1388Crossref PubMed Scopus (894) Google Scholar), but we used low salt conditions that did not displace synapsin from SVs (Fig. 1C). Parkin was recently found to bind and ubiquitinate the SV-associated protein CDCRel-1, although direct localization of parkin to SVs was not shown (11Zhang Y. Gao J. Chung K.K. Huang H. Dawson V.L. Dawson T.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 13354-13359Crossref PubMed Scopus (842) Google Scholar). Our findings do not preclude an interaction with CDCRel-1. Indeed, only a fraction of CDCRel-1 is associated with SVs (20Beites C.L. Xie H. Bowser R. Trimble W.S. Nat. Neurosci. 1999; 2: 434-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar) and the interaction with parkin could occur at a distinct site. Importantly, we find that parkin occurs on the SPM. This prompted us to investigate both the nature of the membrane association and whether parkin was targeted to a specific membrane specialization. The sequence of parkin does not predict any transmembrane domains or lipid binding motifs. To characterize the nature of parkin's association with synaptic membranes, we resuspended LP1 pellets in either homogenization buffer alone or homogenization buffer containing high salt, Na2CO3 (pH 11.5), ATP, or EGTA. After re-pelleting the samples, we found that parkin was solubilized by raising ionic strength with high salt or by stripping the membrane with high pH. In contrast, none of the parkin was solubilized with ATP treatment and only a very small fraction was solubilized by Ca2+ chelation with EGTA (Fig.1D). Our results suggest that the association of parkin with synaptic membranes is electrostatic rather than hydrophobic, possibly mediated by an interaction with another protein. In contrast, none of the treatments removed integral membrane proteins such as GluR2/3 from LP1 membranes, whereas high pH but not high salt removes α-synuclein from membranes (Fig. 1D). To further characterize the membrane association of parkin, we tested its ability to be solubilized by detergents. Pellets from LP1 were resuspended at 4 °C, in either homogenization buffer alone or homogenization buffer containing various detergents and re-pelleted. Interestingly, most of the parkin sedimented in the pellet after treatment with 1% Triton X-100 but not with 1% deoxycholate (Fig. 1E). In contrast, both α-synuclein and GluR2/3 were at least partially solubilized by both detergents. Importantly, resistance to solubilization in the non-ionic detergent Triton X-100 is a property of proteins within specialized microdomains of the plasma membrane, namely lipid rafts and PSDs, which serve as key sites for cell signaling and synaptic transmission (21Brown D.A. London E. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1998; 14: 111-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (2557) Google Scholar, 22Kennedy M.B. Science. 2000; 290: 750-754Crossref PubMed Scopus (659) Google Scholar). Further, PDZ proteins have been found to be major components of these domains. Both the finding that SPM-associated parkin is resistant to extraction with Triton X-100 and the observation that a putative PDZ binding motif occurred at its C terminus prompted us to investigate further whether parkin interacts with PDZ proteins. To identify PDZ proteins that bind parkin, we expressed a GST fusion protein encoding the C-terminal 24 amino acids of parkin (GST·CT) in E. coli. We also expressed GST alone, GST fused to the parkin Ubl domain (GST·Ubl), and GST fused to the C terminus of the NMDA receptor 2B subunit (GST·NR2B), which is known to interact with the first PDZ domain of PSD-95. As a further control for PDZ-mediated interactions, we expressed a GST fusion protein encoding the C terminus of parkin in which the last amino acid was changed from valine to glutamic acid (GST·V/E), a mutation that has been shown to disrupt PDZ-dependent interactions (23Penzes P. Johnson R.C. Sattler R. Zhang X. Huganir R.L. Kambampati V. Mains R.E. Eipper B.A. Neuron. 2001; 29: 229-242Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). The fusion proteins were used to pull-down interacting proteins from rat brain synaptosomes (P2). Bound proteins were eluted and analyzed by immunoblotting with a panel of antibodies raised against various PDZ proteins. GST·CT but not GST·Ubl or GST alone pulled-down the PDZ protein CASK, the mammalian homolog of C. elegans Lin-2 from brain extracts (Fig. 2A). In C. elegans, the three PDZ proteins, Lin-2, Lin-7, and Lin-10, are involved in targeting the receptor tyrosine kinase LET-23, an epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor homolog, to the basolateral membrane in vulval epithelial cells (24Kaech S.M. Whitfield C.W. Kim S.K. Cell. 1998; 94: 761-771Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). The C terminus of LET-23 binds the class I PDZ domain of Lin-7, which in turn forms a complex with Lin-2 and Lin-10. Importantly, CASK/mLin-2, Veli/mLin-7, and Mint/mLin-10, the mammalian homologs of Lin-2, Lin-7, and Lin-10, also form a tight tripartite complex that is expressed at high levels in brain (25Butz S. Okamoto M. Sudhof T.C. Cell. 1998; 94: 773-782Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar). As in C. elegans, the interactions between CASK, Veli, and Mint do not involve the PDZ domains, leaving them free to interact with other proteins. The class II PDZ domain of CASK has been shown to interact with the C terminus of neurexin, the receptor for α-latrotoxin, the black widow spider venom (14Hata Y. Butz S. Sudhof T.C. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 2488-2494Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) as well as syndecan, a cell surface heparan sulfate proteoglycan (13Hsueh Y.P. Yang F.C. Kharazia V. Naisbitt S. Cohen A.R. Weinberg R.J. Sheng M. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 139-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). Importantly, the sequence FDV, at the C terminus of parkin is highly reminiscent of motifs found to interact with CASK (26Songyang Z. Fanning A.S. Fu C. Xu J. Marfatia S.M. Chishti A.H. Crompton A. Chan A.C. Anderson J.M. Cantley L.C. Science. 1997; 275: 73-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (1224) Google Scholar). Further, the interaction between CASK and parkin appears to be PDZ-dependent, because the valine to glutamic acid mutation in GST·V/E abolishes binding (Fig. 2A). None of the other PDZ proteins we tested, including several with type II PDZ domains such as PICK1, GRIP1 & 2, Tiam1, bound the C terminus of parkin, demonstrating the specificity of the parkin-CASK interaction (Fig. 2B). Similarly, PSD-95 was efficiently pulled-down with GST·NR2B but not with GST·CT. Together, these data indicate that the C terminus of parkin binds CASK specifically via a type II PDZ-mediated interaction. CASK has been shown previously to occur in both synaptic and non-synaptic membranes and to be enriched in PSDs (13Hsueh Y.P. Yang F.C. Kharazia V. Naisbitt S. Cohen A.R. Weinberg R.J. Sheng M. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 139-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). The finding that the C terminus of parkin binds CASK prompted us to ask whether parkin was co-localized with CASK in Triton X-100-insoluble, plasma membrane microdomains, such as PSDs and lipid rafts. We prepared PSD fractions from rat brain by sequential Triton X-100 and Sarkosyl extractions of purified synaptosomes. After the first Triton X-100 extraction, both parkin and CASK were enriched in the pellet (PSD I) compared with the supernatant (Sup I), as was PSD-95, the prototypic PSD marker (Fig. 2C). In contrast, synaptophysin was efficiently extracted with Triton X-100 and found predominantly in the supernatant. Importantly, essentially all the parkin and CASK were recovered in the pellet after the second extraction with Triton X-100 (PSD II), suggesting they occur in the PSD along with PSD-95. However, in contrast to PSD-95, which is associated with the PSD core (PSD III), most of the parkin and CASK were solubilized by sarkosyl, suggesting a more peripheral association with the PSD, as shown previously for CASK and other PSD proteins (13Hsueh Y.P. Yang F.C. Kharazia V. Naisbitt S. Cohen A.R. Weinberg R.J. Sheng M. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 139-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar, 23Penzes P. Johnson R.C. Sattler R. Zhang X. Huganir R.L. Kambampati V. Mains R.E. Eipper B.A. Neuron. 2001; 29: 229-242Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). Further, because neither parkin nor CASK is exclusively synaptic, we were also interested in whether they occurred together in other Triton X-100-insoluble membrane compartments, such as lipid rafts. Lipid rafts were prepared by extracting purified synaptosomes with ice-cold Triton X-100 followed by flotation through a sucrose gradient. Importantly, we find that both parkin and CASK floated to the same low density fraction as the prototypic brain raft markers flotillin and Thy-1 (27Bickel P.E. Scherer P.E. Schnitzer J.E. Oh P. Lisanti M.P. Lodish H.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13793-13802Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar, 28Ledesma M.D. Simons K. Dotti C.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 3966-3971Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2D). Further, PSD-95 also floated to the same fraction as parkin, CASK, Thy-1, and flotillin, consistent with its previous localization in raft-like membranes in brain (29Perez A.S. Bredt D.S. Neurosci. Lett. 1998; 258: 121-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). In contrast, the two synaptic proteins, synaptophysin and α-synuclein remained at the bottom of the gradient, validating the purity of our raft preparation. Rafts represent specialized subdomains of the plasma membrane, which appear to function as platforms for integrating cellular information at the cell surface (21Brown D.A. London E. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1998; 14: 111-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (2557) Google Scholar). Further, rafts are involved in sorting a subset of proteins such as Thy-1 to axonal membranes in polarized hippocampal neurons (28Ledesma M.D. Simons K. Dotti C.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 3966-3971Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). Whereas our identification of CASK in rafts is novel, other synaptic PDZ proteins such as PSD-95 and GRIP, have been found in lipid rafts previously, suggesting a functional link between the PSD and lipid raft compartments (18Bruckner K. Pablo Labrador J. Scheiffele P. Herb A. Seeburg P.H. Klein R. Neuron. 1999; 22: 511-524Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar, 29Perez A.S. Bredt D.S. Neurosci. Lett. 1998; 258: 121-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Our finding of parkin and CASK in lipid rafts may have special relevance for neurodegenerative disease. Indeed, amyloid precursor protein (APP), presenilin, and prion protein (PrP) have all been localized to lipid rafts (30Lee S.J. Liyanage U. Bickel P.E. Xia W. Lansbury Jr., P.T. Kosik K.S. Nat. Med. 1998; 4: 730-734Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar, 31Vey M. Pilkuhn S. Wille H. Nixon R. DeArmond S.J. Smart E.J. Anderson R.G. Taraboulos A. Prusiner S.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 14945-14949Crossref PubMed Scopus (489) Google Scholar). Further, both the processing of APP into the amyloidogenic Aβ42 fragment and the conversion of normal PrPc into the scrapies isoform PrPsc, appear to occur within rafts. Whether parkin or CASK is implicated in these processes remains to be determined. It is interesting to note, however, that the CASK partner, Mint has been implicated in APP processing (32Mueller H.T. Borg J.P. Margolis B. Turner R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 39302-39306Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Importantly, our finding that parkin and CASK are co-localized in PSDs and lipid rafts further substantiates the biological relevance of their PDZ-mediated interaction and prompted us to examine whether they are also co-localized in cultured cortical neurons. To determine the subcellular localization of parkin in cortical neurons, we prepared primary cultures from E16 rat cortex and used immunofluorescence with double labeling for parkin and various markers. Consistent with our subcellular fractionation data above (Fig.1A), endogenous parkin staining appeared punctate in neuronal processes and cell bodies, suggesting parkin associates with membranes (Fig. 3). This contrasted markedly with the more diffuse staining pattern seen with the somato-dendritic marker, MAP2 (Fig. 3C). Further, a significant portion of the punctate parkin staining in processes co-localized with synaptophysin, again supporting a localization of parkin at synaptic terminals (Fig. 3B). Interestingly however, whereas a portion of the parkin staining, especially in cell bodies, did not co-localize with synaptophysin, CASK staining extensively overlapped with parkin, in both neuronal processes and in cell bodies (Fig. 3A). Importantly, the finding that endogenous parkin is exquisitely co-localized with endogenous CASK in cortical neurons further supports the biologic relevance of the PDZ-mediated parkin-CASK interaction. The finding that the C terminus of parkin binds CASK and that they have a very similar subcellular distribution prompted us to examine whether the proteins also interactin vivo in brain and whether parkin ubiquitinates CASK. We were unable to immunoprecipitate parkin with the ASP5p antibodies used above. We therefore raised a new antibody against the Ubl domain of rat parkin (Ubl1–103), which recognizes a ∼52-kDa band, the predicted size of parkin, in both whole brain lysate and parkin-transfected COS-7 cells (Fig.4A). This band is eliminated when the antibody is pre-absorbed with the immunogen and importantly, the Ubl1–103 antibody immunoprecipitated parkin (Fig.4B). To identify PDZ proteins associated with parkinin vivo, we used the Ubl1–103 antibody to immunoprecipitate parkin from rat brain synaptosomes (P2). The Ubl1–103 antibody efficiently co-immunoprecipitated CASK suggesting that parkin interacts with CASK in vivo (Fig.4C). Parkin has been shown to function as an E3 Ub-ligase, but to date only three substrates of parkin-mediated ubiquitination have been identified (6Shimura H. Schlossmacher M.G. Hattori N. Frosch M.P. Trockenbacher A. Schneider R. Mizuno Y. Kosik K.S. Selkoe D.J. Science. 2001; 293: 263-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (955) Google Scholar, 11Zhang Y. Gao J. Chung K.K. Huang H. Dawson V.L. Dawson T.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 13354-13359Crossref PubMed Scopus (842) Google Scholar, 33Imai Y. Soda M. Inoue H. Hattori N. Mizuno Y. Takahashi R. Cell. 2001; 105: 891-902Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (933) Google Scholar). To determine whether parkin also ubiquitinates CASK, we carried out an in vitroubiquitination assay by incubating parkin, immunoprecipitated from brain lysates, with His-tagged Ub, recombinant E1, and UbcH7, an E2 known to support parkin's E3 ubiquitin ligase activity (10Shimura H. Hattori N. Kubo S. Mizuno Y. Asakawa S. Minoshima S. Shimizu N. Iwai K. Chiba T. Tanaka K. Suzuki T. Nat. Genet. 2000; 25: 302-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (1713) Google Scholar), in the presence of ATP. High molecular weight, His-ubiquitinated proteins were observed in the presence of parkin, His-Ub, E1, UbcH7, and ATP but not in control reactions lacking either parkin or UbcH7, confirming that parkin exhibited E2-dependent Ub-ligase activity in our assay (Fig. 4D). Interestingly, despite the robust co-immunoprecipitation of CASK with parkin, the electrophoretic mobility of CASK was not altered, suggesting it is not ubiquitinated by parkin (Fig. 4D). The precise role of CASK in parkin-mediated ubiquitination therefore remains to be determined, but may involve trafficking the E3 Ub-ligase to the appropriate subcellular compartments, a role consistent with CASK's previously described function (24Kaech S.M. Whitfield C.W. Kim S.K. Cell. 1998; 94: 761-771Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar, 34Setou M. Nakagawa T. Seog D.H. Hirokawa N. Science. 2000; 288: 1796-1802Crossref PubMed Scopus (607) Google Scholar). The finding that parkin occurred at the PSD suggested it may also interact with proteins other than CASK at this site. Interestingly, despite the absence of direct binding to the C terminus of parkin (Fig. 2B), parkin robustly co-immunoprecipitated the PDZ protein PSD-95 as well as the NMDAR NR2B subunit, Calcium and calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) and homer 1a (Fig. 4C). These proteins are all known to associate as part of a large multimeric complex, implicated in NMDA trafficking, scaffolding, and signaling at the PSD (35Husi H. Ward M.A. Choudhary J.S. Blackstock W.P. Grant S.G. Nat. Neurosci. 2000; 3: 661-669Crossref PubMed Scopus (1029) Google Scholar). Our findings suggest that parkin interacts with this protein complex, possibly via CASK. In contrast, neither MUPP1, which contains 13 PDZ domains, nor the PDZ protein neurabin I were co-immunoprecipitated with parkin. Similarly, neither neurexin I, which binds the PDZ domain of CASK (14Hata Y. Butz S. Sudhof T.C. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 2488-2494Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), nor α-synuclein were co-immunoprecipitated with parkin (Fig. 4C). We do not know, however, whether anO-glycosylated form of α-synuclein, which has recently been shown to be a parkin substrate (6Shimura H. Schlossmacher M.G. Hattori N. Frosch M.P. Trockenbacher A. Schneider R. Mizuno Y. Kosik K.S. Selkoe D.J. Science. 2001; 293: 263-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (955) Google Scholar), is co-immunoprecipitated with our Ubl1–103 antibody. Importantly, these findings suggest that parkin interacts specifically with CASK and the NMDAR complex but not with other PDZ and non-PDZ proteins in brain. Although it is not known whether CASK and the NMDAR complex, in turn, interact with each other, they both occur at the PSD and the PDZ domain of Veli binds the C terminus of the NMDA receptor NR2 subunit, possibly providing a link between the two complexes (36Jo K. Derin R. Li M. Bredt D.S. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 4189-4199Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Further, a PDZ domain of Mint binds the C terminus of KIF17, a kinesin superfamily molecular motor, suggesting a role for the CASK/Mint/Veli complex in dendritic transport of NMDA receptor-containing vesicles along micotubules (34Setou M. Nakagawa T. Seog D.H. Hirokawa N. Science. 2000; 288: 1796-1802Crossref PubMed Scopus (607) Google Scholar). Although CASK itself does not appear to be ubiquitinated by parkin (Fig.4D), it may also function in trafficking parkin or in providing a scaffold for parkin-mediated ubiquitination of other proteins within the NMDA receptor complex. Importantly, we have shown, for the first time, that a PDZ-mediated interaction is implicated in the pathogenesis of PD. We have also shown that parkin, an E3 Ub-ligase, is localized to lipid rafts and the PSD suggesting a novel role for ubiquitination in these subcellular compartments. Indeed, the potential for parkin-mediated ubiquitination to regulate key synaptic proteins, such as those found in the CASK and NMDAR complexes, has important implications for our understanding of both synaptic transmission and plasticity.

To clarify the physiological functions of these b-series gangliosidesin vivo, we have established a gene knockout mice line for α-2,8-sialyltransferase (9Haraguchi M. Yamashiro S. Yamamoto A.

As expected, all b-series structures were deleted in the mutant mice, and a-series species were slightly increased instead. However, these b-series ganglioside-lacking mice showed an almost intact morphology of the brain and other nervous tissues, and no clear abnormal behaviors were detectable during the early period of life. Despite that GD3 has been considered to mediate Fas-induced apoptosis in lymphoid cells (8De Maria R. Lenti L. Malisan F. d'Agostino F. Tomassini B. Zeuner A. Rippo M.R. Testi R.

However, the mutant mice exhibited clearly reduced regeneration of axotomized hypoglossal nerves compared with the wild type, suggesting that b-series gangliosides are important in the repair of damaged nerves rather than in the differentiation of the nervous system. The chromosomal GD3 synthase gene was isolated from the λgt11 phage library using GD3 synthase cDNA (pD3T-31) and mapped as described previously (11Furukawa K. Soejima H. Niikawa N. Shiku H. Furukawa K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20836-20844Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). To distinguish the true GD3 synthase gene from pseudo-genes, in situ hybridization was performed, and the identity was confirmed based on the correspondence of the gene assignment between humans and mice. The neorgene was inserted between the BalI andAccI sites in exon 1 of the gene, and a 9.5-kb gene fragment was used as a targeting vector as shown in Fig. 1A. The diphtheria toxin A gene was attached to eliminate nonhomologous recombinants as described previously (12Aizawa S. Suda Y. Furuta Y. Yagi T. Takeda N. Watanabe N. Nagayoshi M. Ikawa Y. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 2107-2116Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Homologous recombination was confirmed by Southern blotting using a probe as shown in Fig. 1, generating 4.5- and 2.8-kb fragments by BamHI and 4.6- and 3.1-kb fragments by HindIII digestion in the wild-type and the recombinant allele, respectively (Fig. 1A). Changes in the ganglioside profile of the GD3 synthase gene knockout mice were examined by extracting glycolipids from the brain and liver as described previously (13Furukawa K. Clausen H. Hakomori S. Sakamoto J. Look K. Lundblad A. Mattes M.J. Lloyd K.O. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 7820-7826Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Briefly, glycolipids were extracted with chloroform:methanol (2:1/1:1/1:2) sequentially, and ganglioside fractions were separated by DEAE-Sephadex (A-50) ion-exchange column chromatography. The extracted gangliosides were separated by thin layer chromatography (TLC)2 using HPTLC plates (Merck). Gangliosides were visualized using a resorcinol/HCl spray. The thymus and spleen were dispersed using syringe needles, and the cell number was counted using a hemocytometer. Cells were used for flow cytometry and proliferation and apoptosis assays. Spleen cells were used after elimination of adhesive cells with plastic dishes. Ganglioside expression was analyzed by flow cytometry with monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) for individual structures as described previously (14Zhao J. Furukawa K. Fukumoto S. Okada M. Miyazaki H.

Apoptosis induction was performed by adding anti-Fas mAb Jo2 (1–1,000 ng/ml) to the culture medium of thymocytes or spleen cells treated with cycloheximide (30 μg/ml) as described by Ogasawara et al. (15Ogasawara J. Suda T. Nagata S. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 181: 485-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). The apoptotic cell population was evaluated by flow cytometry after propidium iodide staining. Regeneration of axotomized hypoglossal nerves was examined as described by Itohet al. (16Itoh M. Fukumoto S. Kuga Y. Mizuno A. Furukawa K. Glycobiology. 1999; 9: 1247-1252Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Briefly, mice were anesthetized by sodium pentobarbital, and the right hypoglossal nerve was cleaved. Ten weeks after treatment, 20 ml of 30% HRP (Toyobo, Osaka) in saline was injected into the tongue and perfused intracardially with heparin-Na/saline and then fixed with 10% formalin in 0.1m phosphate buffer. The lower brain stem containing the hypoglossal nerve nuclei was dissected, and 50-μm serial cross-sections were prepared and then stained by adding 3,3′-diaminobenzidine and H2O2. The established GD3 synthase gene knockout mice (Fig.1C) exhibited changes in the ganglioside components as expected from biochemical enzyme analyses as shown in Fig. 1B (17Pohlentz G. Klein D. Schwarzmann G. Schmitz D. Sandhoff K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 7044-7048Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Namely, all b-series gangliosides including GD3, GD2, GD1b, GT1b, and GQ1b were deleted, and a-series gangliosides such as GM1, GD1a, and GM2 were accumulated (Fig.1Ea). In the enzyme assay with membrane fractions of brain tissues, GD3 synthase activity completely disappeared in the mutant mice, whereas GM3 synthase and GD1a synthase activity were retained (Fig. 1D, a and b). Heterozygotes showed approximately half the level of GD3 synthase activity and the corresponding profiles of gangliosides. It was also confirmed that neither GD3 synthase activity nor b-series gangliosides were detectable in the mutant embryonal brains throughout development (E10–E18) (Fig.1, Dc and Eb), indicating that there was no different isoform of GD3 synthase expressed in early development. Brains from newborn homozygotes were also negative for the enzyme activity and its products (data not shown). No changes in the neutral glycolipid components were detected (data not shown). b-series ganglioside-lacking mice were born and grew up without gross abnormal behavior. They showed normal hindlimb reflex, postural changes, spontaneous motor activity, swimming ability, flinch hearing, and no sign of ataxia. Current analyses for the activity of memory and learning such as the Morris water-maze test, passive avoidance test, Y-maze test, etc. also showed no abnormal findings in the mutants (data not shown). In macroscopic and histological analysis of brain tissues, the mutant mice had almost normal size, shape, and weight of brains being indistinguishable from those of wild type. The following sites were carefully examined and exhibited almost normal morphology: cortices, striatum, callosum, hippocampus, ventricles, choroid plexus, cerebellum, and brain stem. The retina also showed no abnormalities in the laminar architecture and number of neurons, although it was one of the sites where the GD3 synthase gene was most strongly expressed (18Yamamoto A. Yamashiro S. Fukumoto S. Haraguchi M. Atsuta M. Shiku H. Furukawa K. Glycoconj. J. 1996; 13: 471-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The majority of b-series gangliosides deleted in the mutant mice were also deleted in GM2/GD2 synthase knockout mice (19Takamiya K. Yamamoto A. Furukawa K. Yamashiro S. Shin M. Okada M. Fukumoto S. Haraguchi M. Takeda N. Fujimura K. Sakae M. Kishikawa M. Shiku H. Furukawa K. Aizawa S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 10662-10667Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar) except for GD3. Therefore, the phenotypes of the mutant mice might be similar to those of complex ganglioside-lacking mice. The findings described above indicated that b-series gangliosides including GD3 are not indispensable for the morphogenesis of nerve tissues as previously described (20Kawai H. Allende M.L. Wada R. Kono M. Sango K. Deng C. Miyakawa T. Crawley J.N. Werth N. Bierfreund U. Sandhoff K. Proia R.L. J. Biol.

A number of studies have been performed to investigate the involvement of gangliosides in the regulation of the immune system (14Zhao J. Furukawa K. Fukumoto S. Okada M. Miyazaki H. Shiku H.

Although GD1b expression was completely deleted and GM1 expression was moderately increased in mutant thymocytes (Fig.2A) and splenocytes (data not shown), the thymus and spleen were normally formed, and no changes were detected in size, shape, and cell number in the mutants (Fig.2C). The ratio of CD8+ thymocytes was reduced (Fig. 2B), and the proliferative response to various stimulations in the mutant were generally increased (concanavalin A, anti-CD3) or not changed (interleukin-2) (data not shown), although the mechanisms remain to be clarified. Recently it was reported that Fas-induced apoptosis of leukocytes was mediated via GD3 (10De Maria R. Rippo M.R. Schuchman E.H. Testi R. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 187: 897-902Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). To analyze the resistance of b-series ganglioside-lacking mice to Fas-induced apoptosis, thymocytes from the wild-type and the mutant mice were used for the induction of apoptosis. However, no reduction in the sensitivity to the Fas-induced apoptosis could be detected (Fig.3). In the presence of cycloheximide, ∼50% of thymocytes from the wild type underwent apoptotic cell death at 12 h of incubation with Jo2 (10 ng/ml). Roughly 55% of those from the mutant also died approximately at the same time point. The sensitivity to apoptosis with various concentrations of Jo2 was also very similar between the two genetic types (Fig. 3A). The intensities of fragmented DNA and the formation of sub-G1 in the DNA histogram during the induced apoptosis were also very similar (Fig. 3, B and C). Thus, deletion of b-series gangliosides did not alter the sensitivity of thymocytes to Fas-induced apoptosis, although DeMaria et al.(10De Maria R. Rippo M.R. Schuchman E.H. Testi R. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 187: 897-902Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar) reported the significant role of GD3 as a mediator of apoptosis.Figure 3The sensitivity of thymocytes to Fas-induced apoptosis did not change in the mutant mice.A, apoptosis induced by Jo2 (1–1,000 ng/ml) with cycloheximide.

Fukumoto S. Kuga Y. Mizuno A. Furukawa K. Glycobiology. 1999; 9: 1247-1252Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar) and reported that exogenous gangliosides were very effective for the promotion of regeneration. In the case of GD3 synthase gene knockout mice, regeneration levels were definitely reduced compared with the wild type, i.e. by ∼45% (Fig. 4, A andC). The surviving neuron number was also reduced to ∼50% (Fig. 4B), suggesting that b-series gangliosides are essentially needed for the protection of neuronal death and repair of damaged hypoglossal nerves. In the axotomized rat, exogenously added b-series gangliosides, i.e. GT1b and GD1b, were most effective in the regeneration (23Itoh M. Fukumoto S. Iwamoto T. Mizuno A. Rokutanda A. Ishida H.-K. Kiso M. Furukawa K. Glycobiology. 2001; 11: 125-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). The present findings shown here appear to be in good agreement with those of the previous rat experiment (23Itoh M. Fukumoto S. Iwamoto T. Mizuno A. Rokutanda A. Ishida H.-K. Kiso M. Furukawa K. Glycobiology. 2001; 11: 125-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Furthermore, GM2/GD2 synthase gene transgenic mice in which b-series gangliosides were reduced also showed similar levels of reduction in the surviving neuron number and the regeneration activity (data not shown). Thus, endogenously generated b-series gangliosides turned out to be critical in the repair of damaged neural tissues in vivo, while their roles in the neurogenesis or apoptosis were not clearly elucidated.

We show that depotentiation induced by low frequency stimulation (LFS) (2 Hz, 10 min, 1200 pulses) was input-specific and dependent onN-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor activation. The ability of LFS to reverse LTP was mimicked by a brief application of NMDA. This NMDA-induced depotentiation was blocked by adenosine A1 receptor antagonist. However, the reversal of LTP by LFS was unaffected by metabotropic glutamate receptor antagonism. This LFS-induced depotentiation was specifically prevented by protein phosphatase (PP)1 inhibitors, okadaic acid, and calyculin A but not by the PP2A or PP2B inhibitors. Furthermore, by using phosphorylation site-specific antibodies, we found that LFS-induced depotentiation is associated with a persistent dephosphorylation of the GluR1 subunit of amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid receptor at serine 831, a protein kinase C and calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) substrate, but not at serine 845, a substrate of cAMP-dependent protein kinase. This effect was mimicked by bath-applied adenosine or NMDA and was specifically prevented by okadaic acid. Also, the increased phosphorylation of CaMKII at threonine 286 and the decreased PP activity seen with LTP were overcome by LFS, adenosine, or NMDA application. These results suggest that LFS erases LTP through an NMDA receptor-mediated activation of PP1 to dephosphorylate amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid receptors and CaMKII in the CA1 region of the hippocampus.

Collingridge G.L. Nature. 1993; 361: 31-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (9607) Google Scholar). Although LTP is very persistent, current work has provided evidence that various manipulations or pharmacological treatment when applied shortly after LTP induction can reverse it. For example, it has been shown that transient anoxia occurring 1–2 min after LTP induction prevented the stable expression of LTP (2Arai A. Kessler M. Lynch G. Neurosci. Lett. 1990; 19: 41-44Crossref Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Such time-dependent reversal of LTP was also effectively induced by low frequency afferent stimulation (1–5 Hz) when delivered within 10 min of LTP induction, both in vivo (3Barrionuevo G.

This reversal of synaptic strength from the potentiated state to pre-LTP levels has been called depotentiation and may provide a mechanism of preventing the saturation of synaptic potentiation and increase the efficiency and the capacity of the information storage of the neuronal networks (10Huang C.C.

Liang Y.C. Hsu K.S. J. Neurosci. 1999; 15: 9728-9738Crossref Google Scholar). In addition, the induction of depotentiation requires the activation of PP-coupled cascades. In this study, we describe experiments in the CA1 region of rat hippocampus designed to characterize further this form of synaptic plasticity using both electrophysiological and biochemical techniques. In particular, we addressed the following questions. 1) Is the LFS-induced depotentiation input-specific and dependent on NMDA and/or mGluR activation? 2) Does the pharmacological activation of NMDA receptors mimic the LFS to elicit a time-dependent reversal of LTP? 3) What is the kind of PP participating in LFS-induced depotentiation, and what might be its substrate(s) after its activation during depotentiation? We provide evidence that a PP1-mediated dephosphorylation of GluR1 subunit of AMPA receptors at serine 831, known as a substrate of CaMKII and PKC, may be a major expression mechanism for NMDA receptor-dependent homosynaptic LFS-induced depotentiation. These results also imply that PP1 may serve as the sensor of the level of neuronal activity and in turn regulates the development of LTP at Schaffer collateral-CA1 synapses. Hippocampal slices were prepared from 4- to 5-week-old male Sprague-Dawley rats as described previously (7Huang C.C. Liang Y.C. Hsu K.S. J. Neurosci. 1999; 15: 9728-9738Crossref Google Scholar, 18Huang C.C. Hsu K.S. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1999; 520: 783-796Crossref Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Briefly, rats were anesthetized with halothane and decapitated soon after the disappearance of any corneal reflexes. The brain was rapidly removed and immersed in ice-cold artificial cerebral spinal fluid (ACSF) solution (composition in mm: NaCl 117, KCl 4.7, CaCl2 2.5, MgCl2 1.2, NaHCO3 25, NaH2PO4 1.2, and glucose 11 at pH 7.3–7.4) bubbled with 95% O2, 5% CO2. A block of hippocampus was removed, and the middle third of the hippocampus was sectioned in the transverse plane into 400-μm thick slices with a Leica VT1000S tissue slicer (Leica, Nussloch, Germany). After their preparation, slices were placed in a holding chamber of ACSF bubbled with 95% O2, 5% CO2 and kept at room temperature for at least 1 h before recording. For the electrophysiological recording, a single slice was then transferred to a submerge-type recording chamber and held between two nylon nets. The chamber consisted of a circular well of a low volume (1–2 ml) and was continuously perfused with oxygenated ACSF at a flow rate of 2–3 ml/min at 32.0 ± 0.5 °C. Standard extracellular field recording techniques were used (7Huang C.C. Liang Y.C. Hsu K.S. J. Neurosci. 1999; 15: 9728-9738Crossref Google Scholar, 18Huang C.C. Hsu K.S. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1999; 520: 783-796Crossref Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Field excitatory postsynaptic potentials (fEPSPs) were recorded from the stratum radiatum of the CA1 region of the hippocampus using a glass microelectrode filled with 1 m NaCl (resistance 2–3 megohms). A bipolar stainless steel stimulating electrode was placed in stratum radiatum to activate Schaffer collateral/commissural afferents at 0.033 Hz. To stimulate independent inputs to the same cell population, two bipolar stimulating electrodes were positioned on both sides of the recording microelectrode, alternating every 15 s. Their positions were arranged so that the same amount of current evoked two responses that did not differ from each other by >10%. The absence of cross-pathway paired-pulse facilitation was used to ensure the two inputs were independent of each other. The stimulation strength was set to elicit response for which the amplitude was 30–40% of the maximum spike-free response. In all experiments base-line synaptic transmission was monitored for 30 min before drug administration or delivering either high or low frequency stimulation. The strength of synaptic transmission was quantified by measuring the slope of fEPSP. The fEPSP slopes were measured from ∼20 to 70% of the rising phase using a least squares regression. LTP was induced by high frequency stimulation, at the test pulse intensity, consisting of two 1-s trains of stimuli at 100 Hz, delivered with an interval of 20 s. Depotentiation was induced by application of 10 min low frequency trains of stimuli at 2 Hz, and the stimulation intensity was the same as the test pulse intensity. The responses during the trains were not recorded, and for convenience these periods are not shown on the graph. All values of residual potentiation reported here were calculated as the changes in fEPSP slope measured 40 min after the end of LFS. Microelectrodes were pulled from microfiber 1.0-mm capillary tubing using a P-97 electrode puller (Sutter Instrument Co., Novato, CA). Electrical signals were collected with an Axoclamp-2B (Axon Instruments, Foster, CA) filtered with a 1-kHz cut-off frequency, sampled at 10 kHz, and an Intel Pentium-based computer with pCLAMP software (version 7.0, Axon Instruments, Foster, CA) was used to acquire on-line and analyze off-line the data. All drugs were applied by dissolving them to the desired final concentrations in the ACSF and by switching the perfusion from control ACSF to drug-containing ACSF. Appropriate stock solutions of drugs were made and diluted with ACSF just before application. 8-Cyclopentyl-1,3-dipropylxanthine (DPCPX), cypermethrin, and phosphotrienin were dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (Me2SO) stock solution and stored at −20 °C until the day of experiment. The concentration of Me2SO in the perfusing medium was 0.05%, which alone had no effect on the induction of either LTP or depotentiation in the CA1 region of hippocampus (7Huang C.C. Liang Y.C. Hsu K.S. J. Neurosci. 1999; 15: 9728-9738Crossref Google Scholar). 1-Aminoindan-1,5-dicarboxylic acid (AIDA), α-methyl-4-carboxyphenylglycine (MCPG), and α-methyl-l-2-amino-4-phosphonobutyrate (MAP4) were prepared by first dissolving them in an equimolar amount of NaOH as a concentrated stock solution and then diluting to their final concentration in ACSF. The cyclosporin A perfusing solution contained 0.5% ethanol and 0.5% Tween 80. Adenosine, DPCPX, okadaic acid, calyculin A were purchased from Research Biochemicals (Natick, MA); NMDA, d-2-amino-5-phosphonovalerate (d-APV), AIDA, MCPG, MAP, and cypermethrin were obtained from Tocris Cookson Ltd. (Bristol, UK); fostriecin was purchased from Calbiochem. The data for each experiment were normalized relative to base line. The figures show means ± S.E. The significance of the difference between the mean was calculated by a paired or unpaired Student’st test. The number of experiments is indicated byn. Probability values of p < 0.05 were considered to represent significant differences. Hippocampal slices were prepared and treated with high frequency tetanic stimulation with or without low frequency afferent stimulation exactly as described in the electrophysiological experiments. At the end of the experiments, the CA1 subregion of the hippocampal slices between the positions of the stimulating and recording electrodes was dissected out and immediately frozen on dry ice. Three to four microdissected CA1 subregions (from control, 30 min after LTP induction, 17 min after the end of LFS, 24 min after washout of adenosine, or 22 min after washout of NMDA) were pooled together. In each experiment, an entire set of control, LTP, or depotentiation pooled slices was taken from one animal. The microdissected subregions were lysed in ice-cold Tris-HCl buffer solution (TBS; pH 7.4) containing a mixture of protein phosphatase and proteinase inhibitors (50 mm Tris-HCl, 100 mm NaCl, 15 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 50 mm sodium fluoride, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 5 mm EGTA, 5 mm EDTA, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μm microcystin-LR, 1 μm okadaic acid, 0.5% Triton X-100, 2 mmbenzamidine, 60 μg/ml aprotinin, and 60 μg/ml leupeptin) to avoid dephosphorylation and degradation of proteins, and were ground with a pellet pestle (Kontes, Vineland, NJ). Samples were sonicated and spun down at 15,000 × g at 4 °C for 10 min. The supernatant was then assayed for total protein concentration using Bio-Rad Bradford Protein Assay Kit based on the Bradford method (19Bradford M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (217544) Google Scholar), with bovine serum albumin as a standard. Each sample was run on a 7.5% SDS-PAGE gel (for GluR1) or 10% SDS-PAGE gel (for CaMKII) and then transferred to nitrocellulose for immunoblot analysis. Nitrocellulose membrane was incubated in blocking buffer solution containing 5% nonfat dry milk and 0.1% Tween 20 in PBS (124 mm NaCl, 4 mm KCl, 10 mm Na2HPO4, and 10 mmKH2PO4, pH 7.2) for 1 h and then blotted for 2 h at room temperature with antibodies that recognize phosphorylated serine 831 (1:500 dilution) or serine 845 (1:500 dilution) on AMPA receptor GluR1 subunit (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc., Lake Placid, NY) or with a monoclonal antibody to threonine 286-phosphorylated CaMKII α-subunit (1:2000 dilution) (Affinity Bioreagents, Golden, CO). It was then probed with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody for 1 h and developed using the ECL immunoblotting detection system. The immunoblots using phosphorylation site-specific antibodies were subsequently stripped and reprobed with an antibody that recognizes the GluR1 C terminus (1:500 dilution; Calbiochem) or CaMKII C terminus (1:2000 dilution; Upstate Biotechnology, Inc., Lake Placid, NY). The relative amount of GluR1 or CaMKII phosphorylation was analyzed by determining the ratio of the signals detected by using the phosphorylation site-specific antibodies and the phosphorylation-independent antibody. Immunoblots were quantified by densitometric measurement. Hippocampal slices were treated and dissected as described above. A single CA1 subregion was homogenized in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 0.2 mmEDTA, 0.2 mm EGTA, 60 μg/ml aprotinin, and 60 μg/ml leupeptin. Phosphatase activity of 20 ng of protein of CA1 homogenate was measured with the Protein Phosphatase Assay System (Invitrogen) essentially as described by Blitzer et al. (20Blitzer R.D. Connor J.H. Brown G.P. Wong T. Shenolikar S. Iyengar R. Landau E.M. Science. 1998; 280: 1940-1942Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar). The first series of experiments was designed to investigate whether LFS-induced depotentiation is input-specific (i.e. homosynaptic). To address this question, two stimulating electrodes were placed on both sides of the recording microelectrode in the CA1 region to activate two groups of inputs to the same cell population. As a typical example illustrated in Fig. 1 A, independence of inputs activated by the two electrodes was assessed by verifying the absence of heterosynaptic facilitation between the two inputs using paired stimuli applied at 40-ms interval. By having confirmed the independence of afferents activated, LTP was induced by a high frequency tetanic stimulation (see “Experimental Procedures”) to both pathways simultaneously; this was followed by a 2-Hz/10-min LFS to only one pathway to reverse LTP. Under these conditions, the control (heterosynaptic) pathway that did not receive LFS exhibited a normal degree of LTP, whereas LFS resulted in a nearly complete reversal of LTP in the test (homosynaptic) pathway. At control pathway, the mean residual potentiation measured 40 min after the end of LFS was 138.5 ± 7.2% (n = 7) of base line, which was not significantly different from the LTP measured in control slices without LFS delivered (136.8 ± 9.7% of base line; n = 12) (7Huang C.C. Liang Y.C. Hsu K.S. J. Neurosci. 1999; 15: 9728-9738Crossref Google Scholar). In contrast, at test pathway, the mean residual potentiation measured 40 min after the end of LFS was 105.6 ± 6.5% (n = 7) of base line (Fig. 1 B). These results indicated that the reversal of LTP by LFS is specific to the synapses receiving the stimulation. Therefore, LFS-induced depotentiation at Schaffer collateral-CA1 synapses is an input-specific or homosynaptic phenomenon, as is LTP (1Bliss T.V.P. Collingridge G.L. Nature. 1993; 361: 31-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (9607) Google Scholar). We next sought to investigate whether activation of NMDA receptors is necessary for LFS-induced depotentiation. The NMDA dependence of depotentiation in hippocampal CA1 region has been studied previously, but the results have been controversial (5Fujii S. Saito K. Miyakawa H. Ito K. Kato H. Brain Res. 1991; 555: 112-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar, 11O'Dell T.J. Kandel E.R. Learn. Mem. 1994; 1: 129-139PubMed Google Scholar, 21Bashir Z.I. Collingridge G.L. Exp.

To test this point further, the NMDA receptor antagonist d-APV (50 μm) was present when LFS was delivered to elicit depotentiation. As shown in the Fig. 2, in the presence of d-APV, the LFS-induced depotentiation was completely prevented. On average, the residual potentiation measured 40 min after the end of LFS was 133.2 ± 6.4% (n = 8; p < 0.05; unpaired Student’st test) of base line. These results confirmed the previous findings of Fujii et al. (5Fujii S. Saito K. Miyakawa H. Ito K. Kato H. Brain Res. 1991; 555: 112-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar) and O’Dell and Kandel (11O'Dell T.J. Kandel E.R. Learn. Mem. 1994; 1: 129-139PubMed Google Scholar) showing that LFS-induced depotentiation at this synapse requires the activation of NMDA receptors. To establish further that the LFS-induced depotentiation is mediated through the activation of NMDA receptors, it is essential to demonstrate that LFS-induced depotentiation should be mimicked by the direct application of NMDA. For this purpose, the effect of NMDA on the development of LTP was investigated. The base-line responses to stimulation of two independent inputs to a common population of CA1 neurons were monitored in alteration. A high frequency tetanic stimulation was given only to the test pathway to induce homosynaptic LTP, and then NMDA was bath-applied to the slice at different times after LTP induction. In the initial experiments, NMDA was applied immediately after the induction of LTP. A concentration of 10 μm was used because previous work (23Collingridge G.L. Kehl S.L. McLennan H. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1983; 334: 33-46Crossref Scopus (1794) Google Scholar, 24Lee H.K. Kameyama K. Huganir R.L. Bear M.F.

Science. 1994; 265: 2089-2101Crossref Scopus (265) Google Scholar) showed that a brief application of this concentration did not produce a long lasting effect of the evoked synaptic response. A brief (5 min) bath application of NMDA (10 μm) to hippocampal slices resulted in a robust depression of fEPSP, as described (23Collingridge G.L. Kehl S.L. McLennan H. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1983; 334: 33-46Crossref Scopus (1794) Google Scholar, 24Lee H.K. Kameyama K. Huganir R.L. Bear M.F.

Science. 1994; 265: 2089-2101Crossref Scopus (265) Google Scholar). After washout of NMDA, the fEPSP of control pathway was recovery completely (98.7 ± 5.3% of base line, n = 8;p > 0.05; paired Student’s t test). However, at the test pathway, the fEPSP recovered to close to the pretetanus base line after washout of NMDA. On the average, the fEPSP slope measured 40 min after washout of NMDA was 109.8 ± 7.1% (n = 8; p > 0.05; paired Student’st test) of base line (Fig.3 A). As shown in Fig.3 B, the reversal of LTP similar to the above results was also obtained with administration of NMDA beginning 3 min after the LTP induction. The slope of fEPSP measured 40 min after NMDA washout was 114.6 ± 6.7% (n = 7; p > 0.05; paired Student’s t test) of base line. In contrast, when NMDA was applied 10 min after LTP induction, the synaptic responses consistently recovered to the potentiated level, i.e. the slope of fEPSP measured 40 min after NMDA washout was 152.4 ± 8.9% (n = 8; p < 0.05; paired Student’s t test) of base line (Fig. 3 C). These results confirmed and extended the previous findings of Lee et al. (24Lee H.K. Kameyama K. Huganir R.L. Bear M.F. Neuron. 1998; 21: 1151-1162Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (558) Google Scholar) showing that direct application of NMDA can reveal a time-dependent reversal of LTP in the CA1 region of rat hippocampal slices. The above results promote the idea that activation of NMDA receptors may initiate a process that interrupts the biochemical mechanisms leading to the stabilization of LTP. We next investigated what was the biochemical step downstream of NMDA receptor activation to undergo the induction of depotentiation. We and other groups (7Huang C.C. Liang Y.C. Hsu K.S. J. Neurosci. 1999; 15: 9728-9738Crossref Google Scholar, 22Stäubli U. Chun D. Learn. Mem. 1996; 3: 96-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 26Fujii S. Sekino Y. Kuroda Y. Sasaki H. Ito K.I.

Brain Res. 1993; 600: 97-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar) have shown previously that an increase of extracellular adenosine acting on the A1 adenosine receptors may be a component of the mechanism that generates LFS-induced depotentiation. It was therefore of interest to examine the relationship between the NMDA receptor activation and adenosine-mediated signaling pathways in the development of depotentiation. We began by confirming that LFS-induced depotentiation can be mimicked by the direct extracellular application of adenosine. In agreement with our previous findings (7Huang C.C. Liang Y.C. Hsu K.S. J. Neurosci. 1999; 15: 9728-9738Crossref Google Scholar), bath application of adenosine (0.2 mm for 3 min) beginning 3 min after LTP induction completely reversed LTP. On average, the slope of fEPSP measured 40 min after washout of adenosine was 108.8 ± 6.7% (n = 6; p > 0.05; unpaired Student’st test) of base line (Fig.4 A). We next determined whether adenosine was downstream signaling the NMDA receptor activation to undergo the time-dependent reversal of LTP. To address this issue, the A1 adenosine receptor antagonist DPCPX (0.1 μm) was applied starting 10 min before LTP induction and was washed out just after the end of NMDA application. As shown in Fig.4 B, when DPCPX was applied during NMDA application, the NMDA-induced depotentiation was prevented. On average, the slope of fEPSP measured 40 min after NMDA washout was 165.9 ± 6.9% (n = 7; p < 0.05; unpaired Student’st test) of base line. This result suggests that NMDA can increase the extracellular adenosine, as LFS did (7Huang C.C. Liang Y.C. Hsu K.S. J. Neurosci. 1999; 15: 9728-9738Crossref Google Scholar), and adenosine elicits depotentiation by acting on A1 adenosine receptors. In a complementary set of experiments, we tested whether the reversal of LTP induced by a direct adenosine application was affected by NMDA receptor antagonism. We found that d-APV (50 μm) failed to affect adenosine-induced depotentiation, if application started 1 min after LTP induction and continued until the end of adenosine application. On average, the fEPSP slope measured 40 min after washout of adenosine was 106.3 ± 6.8% (n = 5; p > 0.05; unpaired Student’st test) of base line (Fig. 4 C). Therefore, adenosine seems to be the downstream signal for NMDA receptor activation to trigger depotentiation. Previous studies (21Bashir Z.I. Collingridge G.L. Exp. Brain Res. 1994; 100: 437-443Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 28Bashir Z.I. Jane D.E. Sunter D.C. Watkins J.C. Collingridge G.L. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1993; 239: 265-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 29Holscher C. Anwyl R. Rowan M.J. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1997; 322: 155-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) have revealed that metabotropic glutamate receptor (mGluR) activation is primarily necessary for the induction of depotentiation because its induction can be blocked by the mGluR antagonist MCPG and 2(S)-α-ethylglutamic acid. However, this conclusion has been questioned, because a recent report (30Selig D.K. Lee H.K. Bear M.F. Malenka R.C. J. Neurophysiol. 1995; 74: 1075-1082Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar), conducted independently by the laboratories of Bear and Malenka, failed to find any effect of MCPG on CA1 depotentiation. The reason for this discrepancy remains unclear. In an attempt to gain further insight into the role of mGluRs in triggering depotentiation, we next carried out a series of experiments in which we analyzed the effects of mGluR antagonists on the development of LFS-induced depotentiation. Fig.5 summarizes our pharmacological examination of LFS-induced depotentiation. Initially, to assess the role of group I mGluR in the LFS-induced depotentiation, the selective group I mGluR antagonist AIDA was applied during the delivery of LFS. Under this condition, we did not see any effect of AIDA (500 μm) on the LFS-induced depotentiation; the level of depotentiation did not differ from the control values. The residual potentiation measured 40 min after the end of LFS was 106.6 ± 6.3% (n = 8; p > 0.05; unpaired Student’s t test) of base line (Fig. 5 A). In additional experiments we tested the effect of group II and group III mGluR antagonists on the LFS-induced depotentiation. As illustrated in Fig. 5, B and C, neither the non-selective group II mGluR antagonist MCPG (500 μm) nor the selective group III mGluR antagonist α-methyl-l-2-amino-4-phosphonobutyrate (MAP4, 500 μm) affects the induction of depotentiation, if application started 1 min after LTP induction and continued until the end of LFS. The residual potentiation measured 40 min after the end of LFS was 107.2 ± 6.7% (n = 9; p > 0.05; unpaired Student’s t test) and 108.2 ± 6.7% (n = 7; p > 0.05; unpaired Student’st test) of base line, respectively. These results confirmed and extended the previous findings (30Selig D."

N-type neuroblastoma cells (represented by SH-SY5Y and IMR32 cell lines) are characterized by a neuronal phenotype. N-type cell lines are generally N-myc amplified, express the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2, and do not express caspase-8. The present study was designed to determine the mechanism by which N-type cells die in response to specific cytotoxic agents (such as cisplatin and doxorubicin) commonly used to treat this disease. We found that N-type cells were equally sensitive to cisplatin and doxorubicin. Yet death induced by cisplatin was inhibited by the nonselective caspase inhibitor z-Val-Ala-Asp-fluoromethylketone or the specific caspase-9 inhibitor N-acetyl-Leu-Glu-His-Asp-aldehyde, whereas in contrast, caspase inhibition did not prevent doxorubicin-induced death. Neither the reactive oxygen species nor the mitochondrial permeability transition appears to play an important role in this process. Doxorubicin induced NF-κB transcriptional activation in association with I-κBα degradation prior to loss of cell viability. Surprisingly, the antioxidant and NF-κB inhibitor pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate blocked doxorubicin-induced NF-κB transcriptional activation and provided profound protection against doxorubicin killing. Moreover, SH-SY5Y cells expressing a super-repressor form of I-κB were completely resistant to doxorubicin killing. Together these findings show that NF-κB activation mediates doxorubicin-induced cell death without evidence of caspase function and suggest that cisplatin and doxorubicin engage different death pathways to kill neuroblastoma cells.

Despite the array of chemotherapeutic agents presently available and current strategies employing intensive myeloablative chemotherapy with autologous bone marrow transplantation, most patients with high risk NB die of their disease (3Frappaz D.

To improve this situation, the basis for treatment failures as well as the mechanisms that underlie successful responses to chemotherapy in NB cells must be understood. The molecular response of the tumor cells to cytotoxic agents has become the focus of these efforts because it is clear that these pathways can lead to tumor cell death, whereas their absence or failure leads to resistant disease (5Kaufmann S.H. Earnshaw W.C. Exp. Cell Res. 2000; 256: 42-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (1041) Google Scholar). Two major pathways control the death response to cytotoxic agents, both of which rely on the eventual activation of downstream effector caspases. One pathway that leads to caspase activation is initiated by engagement of cell surface death receptors such as Fas/CD95/Apo-1, TNFR1, and TRAIL receptors (6Ashkenazi A. Dixit V.M. Science. 1998; 281: 1305-1308Crossref PubMed Scopus (5085) Google Scholar). Engagement of Fas/CD95/Apo-1 by FasL/CD95L or specific agonistic antibodies transduces a signal that leads to the recruitment of the adapter protein FADD/MORT-1 (7Chinnaiyan A.M. O'Rourke K. Tewari M. Dixit V.M. Cell. 1995; 81: 505-512Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2144) Google Scholar) and procaspase-8, resulting in formation of the death-inducing signaling complex (8Schneider P. Tschopp J. Pharm. Acta Helv. 2000; 74: 281-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar, 9Schulze-Osthoff K. Ferrari D. Los M. Wesselborg S. Peter M.E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 254: 439-459Crossref PubMed Scopus (854) Google Scholar), which leads to caspase-8 activation via autoproteolytic processing. A second major apoptosis-signaling pathway functions independent of surface receptor activation. In this pathway, diverse pro-apoptotic signals eventually provoke a change in mitochondrial function and the release of pro-apoptotic mediators including cytochrome c. Cytochrome c release initiates formation of apoptosome, a complex that includes procaspase-9, dATP, and Apaf-1. This allows proteolytic activation of caspase-9 as a result of induced proximity (10Green D.R. Reed J.C. Science. 1998; 281: 1309-1312Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In both the death receptor/caspase-8 and the mitochondria/casapase-9 pathways, the eventual activation of effector proteases caspases 3, 6, and 7 results in the dismantling of the cell as diverse cellular substrates are proteolyzed (11Green D.R. Cell. 1998; 94: 695-698Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1087) Google Scholar, 12Budihardjo I. Oliver H. Lutter M. Luo X. Wang X. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; 15: 269-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (2240) Google Scholar). Understanding how these elements of the death machinery function in NB pathogenesis, particularly in the response of NB tumors to cytotoxic drugs, is complicated by the fact that the cells that comprise NB tumors are heterogeneous. Heterogeneity is observed in the histologic appearance of NB tumor specimens and is reflected in the phenotypes of cell lines isolated from NB tumor specimens. In vitroculture conditions allow two predominant phenotypes to emerge: N- and S-types, of which N-type cell lines are the most common. N-type cells grow as poorly attached aggregates of small round cells, exhibit neurite-like processes, and possess enzymatic activities associated with neurotransmitter synthesis (13Ross R.A. Spengler B.A. Biedler J.L. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1983; 71: 741-747PubMed Google Scholar). The N-myc oncogene is frequently amplified in N-type lines, and these cell lines are tumorigenic when xenografted into immunodeficient mice (14Ross R.A. Joh T.H. Reis D.J. Spengler B.A. Biedler J.R. Evans A.E. Advances in Neuroblastome Research. Raven Press, New York1980: 151-160Google Scholar, 15Ambros I.M. Ambros P.F. Brodeur G.M. Sawada T. Tsuchida Y. Voute P.A. Neuroblastoma. Elsevier Science Publishers B.V., Amsterdam2000: 233-235Google Scholar). In contrast, S-type cells grow flat, do not display neuritic processes, and are more adherent to substrate in culture. S-type cells have little or no ability to synthesize neurotransmitters, are not N-myc-amplified, and do not form tumors in mice (13Ross R.A. Spengler B.A. Biedler J.L. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1983; 71: 741-747PubMed Google Scholar, 14Ross R.A. Joh T.H. Reis D.J. Spengler B.A. Biedler J.R. Evans A.E. Advances in Neuroblastome Research. Raven Press, New York1980: 151-160Google Scholar, 15Ambros I.M. Ambros P.F. Brodeur G.M. Sawada T. Tsuchida Y. Voute P.A. Neuroblastoma. Elsevier Science Publishers B.V., Amsterdam2000: 233-235Google Scholar). NB cell apoptosis has been most thoroughly characterized in S-type cell lines. The S-type cell line SH-EP1 undergoes apoptosis in response to many anticancer agents, and these effects are blocked by Bcl-2 (16Dole M. Nunez G. Merchant A.K. Maybaum J. Rode C.K. Bloch C.A. Castle V.P. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 3253-3259PubMed Google Scholar). SH-EP1 cells express Fas/CD95, and treatment with CDDP, Dox, or etoposide (VP-16) induces apoptosis that is associated with up-regulation of Fas/CD95 and activation of caspase-8 (17Fulda S. Sieverts H. Friesen C. Herr I. Debatin K.M. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 3823-3829PubMed Google Scholar). Whether this mechanism appropriately characterizes the arguably more malignant N-phenotype and, more generally, NB tumor behavior is uncertain. Recent studies have identified potentially important variations in the expression and function of elements of the apoptosis signaling pathways between S- and N-type NB cell lines. For instance, N-type cells express higher levels of Bcl-2, and increased expression is associated with a drug-resistant phenotype (18Dole M.G. Jasty R. Cooper M.J. Thompson C.B. Nunez G. Castle V.P. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 2576-2582PubMed Google Scholar, 19Lasorella A. Iavarone A. Israel M.A. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 4711-4716PubMed Google Scholar). N-type cells fail to express caspase-8 as a result of silencing through DNA methylation, which is implicated in the relative resistance of some lines to Dox (20Teitz T. Wei T. Valentine M.B. Vanin E.F. Grenet J. Valentine V.A. Behm F.G. Look A.T. Lahti J.M. Kidd V.J. Nat. Med. 2000; 6: 529-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (687) Google Scholar). However, the Fas/CD95 pathway appears to be less important in these cells. Some N-type cells are resistant to Fas-mediated apoptosis (21Kotoula V. Vassilopoulos D. Wellmann A. Mitsiades N. Tsokos M. Proc. Am. Assoc. Cancer Res. 1997; 38: 194Google Scholar), potentially as a result of expression of Bcl-2 and the caspase-8 inhibitory protein cellular FLICE-inhibitory protein or down-regulation of caspase-8 (22Poulaki V. Mitsiades N. Romero M.E. Tsokos M. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 4864-4872PubMed Google Scholar). The N-type SH-SY5Y cell line treated with staurosporine undergoes apoptosis associated with activation of caspase-3 (23Posmantur R. McGinnis K. Nadimpalli R. Gilbertsen R.B. Wang K.K. J. Neurochem. 1997; 68: 2328-2337Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) that does not require the Fas/CD95-L-receptor pathway (24Lopez E. Ferrer I. Brain Res. Mol. Brain Res. 2000; 85: 61-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Despite all of these findings many N-type cell lines are sensitive in vitro to cytotoxic agents (19Lasorella A. Iavarone A. Israel M.A. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 4711-4716PubMed Google Scholar, 25Tieu K. Zuo D.M. Yu P.H. J. Neurosci. Res. 1999; 58: 426-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The present study was designed to determine the mechanism by which specific cytotoxic agents kill N-type NB cell lines in the hopes of defining elements of the death machinery that are functional and can therefore be targeted to treat high risk malignant NB tumors. All tissue culture supplies and reagents including minimal essential medium (MEM), fetal bovine serum (FBS), OPTI-MEM, Geneticin (G418), and LipofectAMINE PLUS were purchased from Invitrogen. The caspase inhibitors Ac-LEHD-CHO, Ac-DEVD-CHO, and z-VAD-fmk were obtained from Alexis Biochemicals (San Diego, CA). Rabbit polyclonal anti-I-κBα and I-κBβ antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biochemicals (Santa Cruz, CA). Mouse monoclonal anti-glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase and rabbit anti-caspase-3 polyclonal antibodies were purchased from BD Transduction Labs (San Diego, CA). Polyclonal anti-caspase-9 antibody was purchased from Cayman Biotech (Ann Arbor, MI). Monoclonal anti-caspase-8 antibody was a gift from Dr. Marcus Peter (University of Chicago, Chicago, IL). The fluorescent probes propidium iodide (PI), 3,3′-dihexyloxacarbocyanine iodide, dihydroethidium, and dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate were purchased from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). Biochemicals including Dox, vitamin C, cyclosporin A, vitamin E, Trolox, pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate (PDTC), 3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT), and 5-aza-2′-deoxycytidine were purchased from Sigma. The expression plasmid pBVIx-Luc containing six NF-κB recognition sites within the promoter sequence linked to the luciferase reporter gene was generously provided by Dr. Gabriel Nuñez (University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI). Human NB cell lines SH-EP1, SH-SY5Y, and IMR32 were cultured in MEM supplemented with 10% FBS, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. The cells were maintained at 37 °C in a humidified 5% CO2 incubator. SH-SY5Y cell lines stably expressing dominant negative I-κBα (I-κBαM) as well as vector-transfected cells were generated as described previously (26Feng Z. Porter A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 30341-30344Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) and maintained in routine MEM supplemented with 500 μg/ml G418. Transfections were carried out using LipofectAMINE PLUS (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, the cells were seeded in tissue culture plates to achieve 50% confluence. Twenty-four hours later, the cells were transfected using a mixture of DNA and LipofectAMINE PLUS in OPTI-MEM (Invitrogen). Eight hours following transfection, the cells were supplemented with serum at a final concentration of 10%. The cells were treated and analyzed for luciferase activity as described below. NB cells were plated in triplicate at 1.2 × 104 cells/well in 96-well culture plates in MEM. On the following day, the cells were treated with Dox (0.5 μg/ml) or CDDP (3 μmol/liter). On consecutive days, the cells were incubated with MTT dye (1 mg/ml) at 37 °C for 4 h and lysed in a buffer containing 20% (w/v) SDS, 50% (v/v)N,N-dimethylformamide (pH 4.5). Absorbance at 600 nm (OD600) was determined for each well using an ELX 808 automated microplate reader (Bioteck Instruments, Winnoski, VT). In assays of cell death inhibition, the cells were preincubated with one of the following caspase inhibitors: 100 μm z-VAD-fmk, 200 μm Ac-DEVD-CHO, or 50 μm Ac-LEHD-CHO in MEM supplemented with 5% FBS prior to the addition of Dox or CDDP. After subtraction of background absorbance, the OD600 of the cells treated with Dox was divided by that of the untreated cells to obtain the percentage of viable cells. In some experiments, cell viability was determined by trypan blue exclusion. For these assays, cells (2 × 105 cells/well) were plated on 24-well plates and treated with Dox (0.5 μg/ml). After variable times, the cells were harvested by trypsinization, washed with phosphate-buffered saline, resuspended in MEM containing 0.2% trypan blue (Invitrogen), and enumerated (living and dead) by light microscopy. The Student's pairedt test was used to test the significance of the difference in cell viability for these assays. The cells were washed twice with cold phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in SDS buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, 100 mmdithiothreitol, 2% SDS, 0.1% bromphenol blue, and 10% glycerol. Aliquots of cell lysates containing 30 μg of total protein were resolved on 12% SDS-PAGE and transferred to Hybond-P membranes (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.). The membranes were incubated with antibodies in 5% milk in phosphate-buffered saline with 0.1% Tween 20. Immunoreactivity was detected using the ECL detection system (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.). The films were exposed at multiple time points to ensure that the images were not saturated. The NB cell lines SH-SY5Y and IMR32 that show no expression of caspase 8 were subjected to demethylating agent 5-aza-2′-deoxycytidine treatment. The cells were plated into 60-mm tissue culture dishes and incubated with 0.5, 1.5, 5, and 10 μm 5-aza-2′-deoxycytidine for a week. At days 4 and 7, cell lysates were collected in SDS sample buffer and subjected to immunoblot analysis. The cells were plated at a density of 2 × 105 cells/well in 24-well plates and cultured overnight. The cells were then treated with Dox for designated time points and harvested by trypsinization. Cell membrane permeability was assessed by flow cytometry. Duplicate samples were mixed with hypotonic lysis buffer (0.1% sodium citrate, 0.01% Triton X-100, and 0.1 mg/ml propidium iodide) and incubated at 4 °C for 4 h. Subsequently, DNA content was determined by flow cytometry (Becton Dickinson, Mountain View, CA), and the data were analyzed using CellQuest software (Becton Dickinson). For the cell protection experiments, vitamin C (100 μm), vitamin E (1 mm), cyclosporin A (1 μm), or PDTC (100 μm) was freshly prepared and added 2 h before Dox treatment. MPT and ROS generation were measured by flow cytometry. NB cells were plated in 24-well plates at 2 × 105 cells/well and incubated in MEM overnight. The cells were treated with Dox (0.5 μg/ml) for indicated times. During the last 30 min of treatment, 100 nm3,3′-dihexyloxacarbocyanine iodide was added to the medium. At the end of the experiment, the medium was removed, and the cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline. The cells were trypsinized and resuspended in 500 μl of 2% FBS-supplemented MEM and analyzed by flow cytometry. Intracellular ROS was measured using two different cell-permeable fluorescent dyes: dihydroethidium (10 μm) and dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate (100 μm). Stock solutions of dihydroethidium (10 mm) and dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate (100 mm) were freshly made in Me2SO prior to each use. The data were analyzed using CellQuest software (Becton Dickinson). SH-SY5Y and IMR32 cells were transfected with 1 μg of the reporter plasmid pBVIx-Luc as described above. To assure identical transfection efficiency in control and treated cells, the cells were replated 12 h after transfection into 12-well plates and after attachment were treated with or without Dox (0.5 μg/ml) and CDDP (3 μmol/liter) for the designated times. The cells were harvested by trypsinization, and luciferase activity was determined according to the manufacturer's instructions using the dual luciferase reagent kit (Promega, Madison, WI) and a Monolight 2010 luminometer (Analytical Luminescence Laboratory, Ann Arbor, MI). An aliquot of the same samples was subjected to protein concentration determination (Bio-Rad). The NF-κB-dependent luciferase activity was then normalized by protein concentration. One S-type (SH-EP1) and two N-type (SH-SY5Y and IMR32) NB cell lines with differences according to type in morphology, expression of neurochemical markers, and N-myc amplification were selected to compare their sensitivities to killing by CDDP and Dox (13Ross R.A. Spengler B.A. Biedler J.L. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1983; 71: 741-747PubMed Google Scholar, 14Ross R.A. Joh T.H. Reis D.J. Spengler B.A. Biedler J.R. Evans A.E. Advances in Neuroblastome Research. Raven Press, New York1980: 151-160Google Scholar, 15Ambros I.M. Ambros P.F. Brodeur G.M. Sawada T. Tsuchida Y. Voute P.A. Neuroblastoma. Elsevier Science Publishers B.V., Amsterdam2000: 233-235Google Scholar). Viability after exposure to these agents was measured by the MTT assay. Time course (Fig. 1,A and B) and dose-response analysis (data not shown) revealed no meaningful differences between these cell lines with respect to either CDDP or Dox. The lack of a difference with respect to Dox was surprising. In part, a difference was expected because Dox killing of NB cells has previously been shown to operate through Fas/CD95-induced caspase-8 activation (17Fulda S. Sieverts H. Friesen C. Herr I. Debatin K.M. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 3823-3829PubMed Google Scholar), and many N-type cells do not express caspase-8 (19Lasorella A. Iavarone A. Israel M.A. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 4711-4716PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, the higher level of Bcl-2 found in the N-type lines used compared with the S-type SH-EP1 cells would predict greater resistance to both of these agents. To definitively exclude the involvement of caspase-8 in the death of these particular N-type cells, we examined whether caspase-8 is expressed or whether the gene is functionally silenced. Caspase-8 protein was present in the SH-EP1 cells but was not detected by immunoblotting in either the SH-SY5Y or IMR32 cells, despite their sensitivity to Dox (Fig. 1C). By way of comparison, all three cell lines express caspase-9 and caspase-3, although the levels of caspase-9 are relatively low in SH-SY5Y cells (Fig. 1C). We further confirmed that the lack of caspase-8 expression results from DNA methylation by treating the cells with 5-aza-2′-deoxycytidine. Within 4 days of this treatment, caspase-8 protein became detectable in the N-type cells (Fig. 1D and data not shown). In aggregate, these results argue that despite a lack of caspase-8 expression, N-type cells are as sensitive to CDDP and Dox as caspase-8 expressing S-type cells. Therefore, a caspase-8-independent death mechanism must exist in N-type cells. Having found that Dox and CDDP each kill N-type cells in the absence of caspase-8, we sought to determine whether there is any evidence of caspase involvement in this process. We first examined treated cells to determine whether pro-caspase-3 becomes processed. Caspase-3 activation is an important indicator of apoptosis because of its apical position in the execution arm of caspase function and its regulation by initiator caspases 8 and 9. A substantial portion of pro-caspase-3 is processed to its active forms (17- and 11-kDa) in N-type cells treated with CDDP (Fig.2A). In contrast, treatment with Dox results in minimal processing (Fig. 2A) even after 72 h of treatment (data not shown). When caspase activity was inhibited using z-VAD-fmk, CDDP killing was almost entirely blocked (Fig. 2B). Identical results were obtained when a caspase-3-selective inhibitor (Ac-DEVD-CHO) was used (data not shown). Similar experiments in which caspase-9 was selectively inhibited using Ac-LEHD-CHO demonstrated almost complete protection against CDDP (Fig.2C). When these same inhibitors were used to probe the caspase dependence of Dox-induced death, the findings were quite different. z-VAD-fmk (or caspase-3 inhibition; data not shown) minimally increased SH-SY5Y and IMR32 cell survival (∼10 and 20%, respectively) (Fig. 2B). Inhibition of caspase-9 had no statistically distinguishable effect on Dox killing (Fig.2C). These results indicate that caspase-9 and caspase-3 are functional in N-type cells and that their activity is necessary for CDDP-induced death. However, cell death induced by Dox appears largely independent of caspase activity and results in only minimal caspase-3 processing. The findings presented above used MTT conversion to reflect cell viability. Because this method assesses viability indirectly (dependent on mitochondrial function and chemical reducing activity), we verified the conclusion that caspases are of little importance in this death process by assessing cell morphology. As shown in Fig.3B, SH-SY5Y cells treated with Dox for 24 h show morphologic evidence of cellular destruction, which includes membrane blebbing, vacuolization of the cytoplasm, and nuclear condensation. Even without affecting morphological evidence of cell death, z-VAD-fmk prevented the hypodiploid DNA changes associated with apoptosis (Fig. 3C). Dox treatment resulted in 21% of cells having hypodiploid DNA content (Fig. 3B) compared with only 2% in the presence of z-VAD-fmk (Fig. 3C). Thus whereas some apparently caspase-dependent apoptotic DNA damage is detected following Dox treatment, morphologic evidence (Fig. 3) and quantitative evidence (Fig. 2) of cell death confirms that Dox killing is substantially independent of caspase activity. Whereas prior work with the S-type SH-EP1 cell line demonstrated that the mechanism of Dox-induced cell death depends on signaling from Fas/CD95 leading to caspase-8 activation, disruption of the ΔψM, cytochrome c release, and caspase-3 activation (17Fulda S. Sieverts H. Friesen C. Herr I. Debatin K.M. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 3823-3829PubMed Google Scholar, 27Fulda S. Susin S.A. Kroemer G. Debatin K.M. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 4453-4460PubMed Google Scholar), the results presented above caused us to suspect that an alternative pathway(s) might function in the N-type cells. In other well characterized models, Dox-induced death requires the generation of ROS (28Lown J.W. Chen H.H. Plambeck J.A. Acton E.M. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1982; 31: 575-581Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar) or collapse of the MPT (29Decaudin D. Geley S. Hirsch T. Castedo M. Marchetti P. Macho A. Kofler R. Kroemer G. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 62-67PubMed Google Scholar). To determine the potential involvement of these signals in N-type cells, we looked for evidence of an increase in ROS and collapse of the MPT over the first 8 h after exposure of SH-SY5Y and IMR32 cells to Dox. Using flow cytometry to detect signals from the fluorescent indicators 3,3′-dihexyloxacarbocyanine iodide to measure ΔψM, dihydroethidium to detect superoxide, and dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate to detect other ROS, we found no evidence of changes in these cells within this time period (data not shown). NF-κB activation has also been implicated in Dox signaling (30Boland M.P. Foster S.J. O'Neill L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12952-12960Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar), although in many cases NF-κB activation protects cells against death (31Baldwin A.S. J. Clin. Invest. 2001; 107: 241-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (1182) Google Scholar). To evaluate the potential involvement of NF-κB in Dox-induced N-type cell death, we blocked NF-κB activation by pretreating cells with the NF-κB inhibitor and antioxidant PDTC. PDTC has at least two chemical properties: a chelating activity for heavy metals and an antioxidant activity of its dithiocarboxy group. It appears that PDTC functions to suppress a reaction required for the release of I-κB from NF-κB, which may involve a ROS. PDTC has no effect on the DNA binding properties of NF-κB, the nuclear uptake of NF-κB, the amount of NF-κB-I-κB complex, or the release of I-κB (32Schreck R. Meier B. Mannel D.N. Droge W. Baeuerle P.A. J. Exp. Med. 1992; 175: 1181-1194Crossref PubMed Scopus (1439) Google Scholar). After 48 h of treatment with Dox in the presence or absence of PDTC, the cells were evaluated by flow cytometry to determine viability on the basis of plasma membrane permeability to PI. PI permeability provided a more direct measure of cell death or survival than MTT conversion, and preliminary experiments demonstrated that it correlated well with morphologic evidence of death. As shown in Fig.4, PDTC completely blocked cell death induced by treatment with Dox for 24 h in both SH-SY5Y and IMR32 cells. In contrast, PDTC had no effect on CDDP-induced death (data not shown). To further define whether the mechanism of Dox resistance by PDTC involves general antioxidant properties or a specific inhibitory action against NF-κB activation, other antioxidants were studied as potential inhibitors. SH-SY5Y cells were pretreated for 30 min with either one of the antioxidants (vitamin C, vitamin E, and Trolox) or 1 μm cyclosporin A to inhibit the MPT, prior to Dox exposure. Viability was determined on the basis of PI exclusion. TableI summarizes the results of these studies. 51% of SH-SY5Y cells treated with Dox alone demonstrate loss of membrane integrity by 24 h. Pretreatment with cyclosporin A to inhibit the MPT has no effect on viability. Similarly, none of the other antioxidants (vitamin C, vitamin E, and Trolox) prevented cell death like PDTC. Thus only PDTC was able to block this process. Similar results were obtained with IMR32 cells (data not shown). These results suggest the possibility that NF-κB activation is involved in Dox-induced cell death, whereas we found no convincing evidence to implicate either the collapse of ΔψM or an increase in ROS.Table ISH-SY5Y cell death as determined by PI permeabilityTreatmentPercentage of deadDox 0.5 μg/ml51 ± 1Dox 0.5 μg/ml and CsA 1 μm56 ± 9Dox 0.5 μg/ml and vitamin C 100 μm44 ± 8Dox 0.5 μg/ml and vitamin E 100 μm46 ± 7Dox 0.5 μg/ml and Trolox 100 μm47 ± 5Dox 0.5 μg/ml and PDTC 100 μm17 ± 2 Open table in a new tab Although PDTC is recognized as an inhibitor of NF-κB, its mechanism of action is not well defined, and its antioxidant properties"

The present study reports the effect of tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α), a proinflammatory cytokine, on the glycosyl- and sulfotransferases of the human bronchial mucosa responsible for the biosynthesis of Lewis x epitope and of its sialylated and/or sulfated derivatives, which are expressed in human bronchial mucins. Fragments of macroscopically normal human bronchial mucosa were exposed to TNF-α at a concentration of 20 ng/ml. TNF-α was shown to increase α1,3-fucosyltransferase activity as well as expression of the two α1,3-fucosyltransferase genes expressed in the human airway,FUT3 and FUT4. It had no influence on α1,2-fucosyltransferase activity or FUT2 expression. It also increased α2,3-sialyltransferase activity and the expression ofST3Gal-III and, more importantly, ST3Gal-IV and both N-acetylglucosamine 6-O-sulfotransferase and galactose 3-O-sulfotransferase. These results are consistent with the observation of oversialylation and increased expression sialyl-Lewis x epitopes on human airway mucins secreted by patients with severe lung infection such as those with cystic fibrosis, whose airways are colonized by Pseudomonas aeruginosa.

Apomucins, which correspond to their peptide part, are encoded by at least six mucin genes (MUC1, MUC2, MUC4, MUC5B, MUC5AC, and MUC7). Bronchial mucins are highly glycosylated and contain from one single to several hundreds of carbohydrate chains. These carbohydrate chains that cover the apomucins are extremely diverse, adding to the complexity of these molecules. Currently, more than 150 different O-linked carbohydrate chains have been described, and the mucins from a single individual probably contain a few hundred different carbohydrate chains (1Roussel P. Lamblin G. Montreuil J. Vliegenthart J.F.G. Schachter H. Glycoproteins and Disease. Elsevier, Amsterdam1996: 351-393Google Scholar). Due to their wide structural diversity forming a combination of carbohydrate determinants, as well as their location at the surface of the airways, mucins may be involved in multiple interactions with microorganisms and are very important in the protection of the underlying airway mucosa. The biosynthesis of these carbohydrate chains is a stepwise process involving many glycosyl- and sulfotransferases. The only structural element shared by all mucin O-glycan chains is anN-acetylgalactosamine residue linked to a serine or threonine residue of the apomucin. The nonreducing end of the chains, which corresponds to the termination of the biosynthetic process, may bear different carbohydrate structures, such as blood groups A, B, or O determinants; H and sulfated H determinants; and Lewis a, Lewis b, Lewis y, and various derivatives of the Lewis x epitope. The synthesis of these different terminal determinants involves different pathways utilizing a variety of transferases (1Roussel P. Lamblin G. Montreuil J. Vliegenthart J.F.G. Schachter H. Glycoproteins and Disease. Elsevier, Amsterdam1996: 351-393Google Scholar, 2Degroote S. Ducourouble M.-P. Roussel P. Lamblin G. Glycobiology. 1999; 9: 1199-1211Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Bronchial mucins may express the Lewis x epitope as well as its sialylated and/or sulfated derivatives. Some of these determinants are ligands for L-selectin (3Crottet P. Kim Y.J. Varki A. Glycobiology. 1996; 6: 191-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The biosynthesis of these different Lewis x derivatives involves four types of transferases: (i) α2,3-sialyltransferase, (ii) α1,3-fucosyltransferase, (iii) galactose-3-O-sulfotransferase, and (iv)N-acetylglucosamine-6-O-sulfotransferase (Fig. 1). Although bronchial mucins secreted by patients suffering from cystic fibrosis or chronic bronchitis share various epitopes such as the sialyl-Lex 1 and sulfo-Lex determinants (4Lamblin G. Boersma A.

Wieruszeski J.M. Lemoine J. Verbert A. Roussel P. Lamblin G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18794-18813Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), in agreement with the oversulfation of mucins observed in this disease. Recently, differences have been observed in the glycosylation of bronchial mucins secreted by patients suffering from bronchial diseases according to the severity of bacterial infection (9Davril M. Degroote S. Humbert P. Galabert C. Dumur V. Lafitte J.J. Lamblin G. Roussel P. Glycobiology. 1999; 9: 311-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). These observations suggest that chronic and severe inflammation of the airway mucosa may be responsible for increased sialylation and expression of sialyl-Lex epitope on the carbohydrate chains of these mucins. There is increasing evidence for a link between inflammation and glycosylation. Since the original work describing increased activity of several glycosyltransferases of the rat liver during turpentine-induced inflammation (10Lombart C. Sturgess J. Schachter H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1980; 629: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), many modifications in the glycosylation of acute-phase glycoproteins have been observed during acute and chronic inflammation. In humans, inflammation induces modifications of theN-glycan chains of different acute-phase glycoproteins, such as α1-acid glycoprotein (11De Graaf T.W. Van der Stelt M.E. Anbergen M.G. van Dijk W.

These modifications may differ according to the early or late phase of acute inflammatory response (17Brinkman-van der Linden E.C. van Ommen E.C. van Dijk W. Glycoconj. J. 1996; 13: 27-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) or the stage of the disease (18Van Dijk W. Mackiewicz A. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1995; 762: 319-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Increased fucosylation and increased expression of sialyl-Lex epitopes have been observed in α1-acid glycoprotein (11De Graaf T.W. Van der Stelt M.E. Anbergen M.G. van Dijk W. J. Exp. Med. 1993; 177: 657-666Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar, 17Brinkman-van der Linden E.C. van Ommen E.C. van Dijk W. Glycoconj.

Monokines may regulate the glycosylation of acute-phase proteins (21Mackiewicz A. Ganapathi M.K. Schultz D. Kushner I. J. Exp. Med. 1987; 166: 253-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). As a matter of fact, IL-1β and TNF-α affect the glycosylation of rat α1-acid glycoprotein. IL-1 and IL-6 change the glycosylation of human α1-acid glycoprotein produced by hepatocytes (22Pos O. Moshage H.J. Yap H. Snieders J.P. Aarden L.A. van Gool J. Boers W. Brugman A.M. van Dijk W. Inflammation. 1989; 13: 415-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 23Azuma Y. Murata M. Matsumoto K. Clin. Chim. Acta. 2000; 294: 93-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), whereas transforming growth factor β has an effect opposite to that produced by IL-6 (24Mackiewicz A. Kushner I. Inflammation. 1990; 14: 485-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Other cells, such as neutrophils, T cells, endothelial cells involved in inflammation, and several epithelial tumor cells, have the machinery to synthesize the sialyl-Lex determinant, a selectin ligand (25Lo S.K. Bevilacqua B. Malik A.B. Circ. Res. 1994; 75: 955-960Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 26Blander J.M. Visintin I. Janeway Jr., C.A. Medzhitov R. J.

Activated Th1 CD4 T cells, which bind to P-selectin and migrate to inflamed tissue, up-regulate α2,3-sialyltransferase (ST3Gal-IV) and α1,3-fucosyltransferase FUT7 (26Blander J.M. Visintin I. Janeway Jr., C.A. Medzhitov R. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 3746-3752PubMed Google Scholar). Endothelial cells from human umbilical vein express several α2,3-sialyltransferases and α1,3-fucosyltransferases, allowing the synthesis of sialyl-Lex determinants, and the expression of these transferases is enhanced by TNF-α (28Majuri M.L. Pinola M. Niemelä R. Tiisala S. Natunen J. Renkonen O. Renkonen R. Eur. J. Immunol. 1994; 24: 3205-3210Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). TNF-α is also able to enhance the expression of sialyl-Lex in some lung cancer cell lines (29Kuninaka S. Yano T. Yokoyama H. Fukuyama Y. Terazaki Y. Uehara T. Kanematsu T. Asoh H. Ichinose Y. Cytokine. 2000; 12: 8-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) and of α2,3-sialyltransferase and α1,3/4-fucosyltransferase in colon carcinoma cell lines that synthesize sialyl-Lex (30Majuri M.L. Niemela R. Tiisala S. Renkonen O. Renkonen R. Int. J. Cancer. 1995; 63: 551-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). TNF-α is also an important factor in airway mucosa inflammation, acting as an initial inflammatory cytokine that subsequently regulates both early neutrophil infiltration and eosinophil recruitment into the lung and airspace (31Lukacs N.W. Strieter R.M. Chensue S.W. Widmer M. Kunkel S.L. J. Immunol. 1995; 154: 5411-5417PubMed Google Scholar). TNF-α, as other cytokines, is found in the airways of patients suffering from bronchial diseases such as chronic bronchitis or cystic fibrosis (32Osika E. Cavaillon J.M. Chadelat K. Boule M. Fitting C. Tournier G. Clement A. Eur. Respir. J. 1999; 14: 339-346Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 33Karpati F. Hjelte F.L. Wretlind B. Scand. J. Infect. Dis. 2000; 32: 75-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) and might affect the glycosylation of airway mucins. The present work was designed to determine the effect of TNF-α on (i) the α2,3-sialyltransferases, α1,3-fucosyltransferases, galactose-3-O-sulfotransferase, andN-acetylglucosamine-6-O-sulfotransferase activities involved in the biosynthesis of Lex, sialyl-Lex, sulfo-Lex, and sulfo-sialyl-Lex determinants by the human bronchial mucosa and (ii) the expression of the different genes possibly encoding these enzymes. Tissues were collected in macroscopically healthy areas of the bronchial tree from patients undergoing surgery for bronchial carcinoma. They were immersed in Leibovitz L15 medium (Invitrogen), immediately transported on ice to the laboratory, and then processed to isolate the mucosa. Mucosa (2–3 cm2) were cut into 1-mm2 pieces and suspended in CMRL-1066 medium (Invitrogen) complemented with 0.2 mm l-glutamine (34Lo-Guidice J.M. Perini J.M. Lafitte J.J. Ducourouble M.P. Roussel P.

They were maintained at 37 °C for 4 or 16 h in the presence or absence (controls) of 20 ng/ml TNF-α (Prepro Tech, London, United Kingdom). After incubation with or without TNF-α, explants were disintegrated with a glass-Teflon homogenizer (1,400 rpm, five strokes) in 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.4, containing 25 mm potassium chloride, 250 mmsaccharose, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and 5 mmmagnesium acetate (34Lo-Guidice J.M.

The mixtures obtained were subjected to 16,000 × g centrifugation for 20 min at 4 °C. The supernatants were ultracentrifuged further at 180,000 ×g for 1 h at 10 °C.

Before assaying α1,2- or α1,3-fucosyltransferase activities, blood samples were obtained from patients to define their secretor and Lewis status.

After incubation for 1 h at 30 °C, the reactions were stopped by the addition of ice-cold methanol.

PCR of mRNAs from FUT1, FUT2, FUT3, FUT4, andFUT5 was carried out under the conditions described previously (47Emery N. Lo-Guidice J.M. Strecker G. Ducourouble M.P. Roussel P. Lamblin G. Glycobiology. 1997; 7: 95-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). For FUT6 and FUT7, we used the same conditions used for other fucosyltransferases, with a different number of amplification cycles (35 cycles for FUT6 and 37 cycles for FUT7). The conditions used for amplification of each α2,3-sialyltransferase mRNA were as follows: 94 °C for 2 min (1 cycle); 94 °C for 1 min, 58 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 1 min 30 s (35 cycles); and 72 °C for 7 min.

In preliminary experiments, optimized conditions were determined to obtain PCR products proportional to the transcript of interest. The expression of glycosyltransferase genes was compared with the expression of the β-actin gene. β-Actin was expressed equally in all samples, indicating that the glycosyltransferase mRNAs were obtained from similar quantities of total RNA. The amplified fragments were verified by digestion with restriction enzymes from Invitrogen (43Yago K. Zenita K. Ginya H. Sawada M. Ohmori K. Okuma M. Kannagi R. Lowe J.B. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 5559-5565PubMed Google Scholar). To determine whether the amplified fragments were FUT3or FUT5 products, a digestion was performed withNaeI, which cleaves the fragments from FUT5 but not those from FUT3. Eleven μl of PCR products were subjected to electrophoresis (220 V, constant-voltage field) on a 2% agarose gel equilibrated in Tris-borate electrophoresis buffer containing ethidium bromide (1 μg/ml). Gels were photographed under UV light and analyzed by computerized scanning of the image using the Gel Analyst 3.01 program. Sizes of the amplified fragments were checked according to the migration of DNA ladders (Roche Molecular Biochemicals).

(2000) J. Biol. Chem. 275, 20896–20902), is a target gene of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) γ. The AQPap mRNA amounts increased following the induction of PPARγ in the differentiation of 3T3-L1 adipocytes. The AQPap mRNA in the adipose tissue increased when mice were treated with pioglitazone (PGZ), a synthetic PPARγ ligand, and decreased in PPARγ+/− heterozygous knockout mice. In 3T3-L1 adipocytes, PGZ augmented the AQPap mRNA expression and its promoter activity. Serial deletion of the promoter revealed the putative peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor response element (PPRE) at −93/−77. In 3T3-L1 preadipocytes, the expression of PPARγ by transfection and PGZ activated the luciferase activity of the promoter containing the PPRE, whereas the PPRE-deleted mutant was not affected. The gel mobility shift assay showed the direct binding of PPARγ-retinoid X receptor α complex to the PPRE. ΔPPARγ, which we generated as the dominant negative PPARγ lacking the activation function-2 domain, suppressed the promoter activity in 3T3-L1 cells, dose-dependently. We conclude that AQPap is a novel adipose-specific target gene of PPARγ through the binding of PPARγ-retinoid X receptor complex to the PPRE region in its promoter.

Recently, we have demonstrated that aquaporin adipose (AQPap),1 which we cloned as the gene abundantly and exclusively expressed in the human adipose tissue, plays an important role in the secretion of glycerol from the adipose tissue in the normal and the insulin-resistant conditions (3Kishida K.

These changes of AQPap mRNA were efficient to supply the glycerol into the liver for gluconeogenesis in the fasting condition. Recently, we identified negative insulin response element (IRE) in the promoter of human and mouse AQPap (5Kishida K. Shimomura I. Kondo H. Kuriyama H. Makino Y. Nishizawa H. Maeda N. Matsuda M.

The AQPap mRNA amounts were regulated through this IRE by fasting/refeeding. On the other hand, in the insulin resistant mice, the negative IRE of the AQPap gene was not sensitive to the high concentration of plasma insulin at fed stage. This insensitivity resulted in the high expression of AQPap mRNA, the increased concentration of plasma glycerol, and enhanced hepatic glucose production in the insulin resistant mice (3Kishida K. Kuriyama H. Funahashi T. Shimomura I. Kihara S. Ouchi N. Nishida M. Nishizawa H. Matsuda M. Takahashi M. Hotta K. Nakamura T. Yamashita S. Tochino Y. Matsuzawa Y. J. Biol.

Therefore, the regulation of AQPap mRNA levels in the adipose tissue is one of the determinant factors for glucose homeostasis in the whole body. During the course of differentiation of adipocytes, AQPap mRNA was not detectable in the undifferentiated 3T3-L1 preadipocytes, and the mRNA was markedly increased during the differentiation of 3T3-L1 adipocytes (3Kishida K.

PPARγ forms stable heterodimers with retinoid X receptors (RXR), and this complex binds to a specific DNA sequence, designated peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor response element (PPRE), in the promoter of the target genes (13Tontonoz P.

PPRE has been identified in the promoters of several genes whose protein products are indispensable for the adipocyte characteristics, such as fatty acid transport protein 1 (FATP1) (14Frohnert B.I.

FATP1 is one of the fatty acid-transport proteins in the adipocytes (18Schaffer J.E. Lodish H.F. Cell. 1994; 79: 427-436Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (744) Google Scholar). Similar to AQPap, the amount of FATP1 mRNA in 3T3-L1 cells was shown to be up-regulated as a consequence of adipose conversion (19Man M.Z. Hui T.Y. Schaffer J.E. Lodish H.F. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 1021-1028Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Transcription of FATP1 is activated by PPARγ, through the PPRE in its promoter, in the differentiation process of the adipocytes (14Frohnert B.I. Hui T.Y. Bernlohr D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3970-3977Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). The free fatty acid released from the adipocytes through the function of FATP1 is another product of lipolysis of the triglycerides and is known to be deeply involved in glucose and lipid metabolism. In the current study, we demonstrate AQPap as an adipose-specific novel PPARγ target gene, by identifying PPRE in its promoter, showing the transcriptional activation of the gene by PPARγ agonist, and revealing the direct binding of PPARγ·RXRα complex to the AQPap PPRE. The coordinated increases of AQPap and FATP1 gene expressions via the PPREs during adipose-differentiation enable the adipocytes to supply glycerol and free fatty acid for the whole body metabolism.

Briefly, 3T3-L1 cells were grown on a 9-cm culture dish or 12-well culture dish in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS). The cells were grown to confluence and were differentiated by incubation in DMEM with 10% FCS containing 0.5 mm 1-metyl-3-isobutylxanthine, 1 μm dexamethasone, and 5 μg/ml insulin for 48 h. The differentiated cells were maintained in DMEM with 10% FCS until the transfection experiments. Typically, for each 12-well culture plate, 1 μg of firefly (Photinus pyralis) luciferase plasmids constructed from pGL3-basic luciferase expression vector and 10 ng of a sea pansy (Renilla reniformis) luciferase, pRL-SV40 plasmid (Promega) were complexed with LipofectAMINE™ 2000 (Invitrogen, Tokyo, Japan) following the manufacturer’s protocol and used for transfection. The medium was removed 24 h later after transfection, and the cells were maintained in DMEM containing 10% FCS for 24 h before harvest for reporter assays. Luciferase activities were measured with the Dual Luciferase reporter assay system (Promega) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. cDNAs for PPARγ2, RXRα, PPARα, and ΔPPARγ were transcribed and translatedin vitro from the plasmids pPPARγ2, pRXRα, pPPARα, and pΔPPARγ, using the TNT® quick coupled transcription/translation systems (Promega). The translation products were verified by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. To study the binding of the nuclear hormone receptors to the putative PPRE, a double-stranded oligonucleotide, PPREwt, spanning nucleotides −98 to −64 of the mouse AQPap gene upstream sequence were 32P-radiolabeled with polynucleotide kinase (Promega). A 15-μl reaction solution containing end-labeled PPRE oligonucleotide probe (2 × 105 cpm) and 1 μl of in vitro translation reaction was incubated for 20 min at 25 °C and 15 min at 4 °C in a buffer containing 20 mm Hepes (pH 8.0), 60 mm KCl, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 10% glycerol, and 1 μg of poly(dI-dC). The DNA-protein complexes were resolved from the free probe by electrophoresis on a 4% polyacrylamide gel in 0.5× TBE buffer (1× TBE = 9 mm Tris, 90 mm boric acid, 20 mm EDTA).

Fig. 1 A shows the expressions of AQPap and PPARγ mRNAs during the differentiation of 3T3-L1 adipocytes. In the undifferentiated state, 3T3-L1 cells had no detectable transcripts of either AQPap or PPARγ. AQPap mRNA expression increased from day 4 after induction of differentiation. PPARγ mRNA induction was seen within 2 days after differentiation of 3T3-L1 cells. Transient transfection assays were performed to know which promoter region of the mouse AQPap gene is important for induced expression of its mRNA during the differentiation of 3T3-L1 adipocytes (Fig. 1 B).

These reporter constructs were transfected into 3T3-L1 preadipocyte (preconfluent state) and fully differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes (day 7 after differentiation-induction). Comparative analysis of luciferase activities between the preadipocytes and adipocytes revealed that the majority of differentiation-induced activation of AQPap gene promoter required sequences between −141 and −14 (Fig. 1 B). Inspection of this region of the mouse AQPap gene promoter revealed a putative PPRE of the direct repeat 1 type at −77 to −93, which is similar to consensus PPRE (Fig. 1, C and D) (11Barak Y.

Enhancements of AQPap mRNA that occurred subsequent to PPARγ induction during the differentiation of 3T3-L1 cells and the existence of putative PPRE site in its promoter strongly suggested that AQPap is a primary target gene of PPARγ. To elucidate this hypothesis in vivo, we treated mice with 0.01% (w/w) pioglitazone (PGZ), synthetic PPARγ ligand (22Lehmann J.M. Moore L.B. Smith-Oliver T.A. Wilkison W.O. Willson T.M. Kliewer S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12953-12956Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3469) Google Scholar) for 2 weeks and measured the mRNA levels of AQPap and PPARγ in the adipose tissue (Fig. 2, A and B). PGZ treatment caused 2.2-fold increase of AQPap mRNA expression in the adipose tissue. As the other side of the spectrum, we examined the AQPap mRNA in PPARγ-deficient mice. The levels of AQPap mRNA expression were significantly decreased in the adipose tissue of PPARγ+/− heterozygous knockout mice (Fig.2, C and D) (12Kubota N. Terauchi Y. Miki H. Tamemoto H. Yamauchi T. Komeda K. Satoh S. Nakano R. Ishii C. Sugiyama T. Eto K. Tsubamoto Y. Okuno A. Murakami K. Sekihara H. Hasegawa G. Naito M. Toyoshima Y. Tanaka S. Shiota K. Kitamura T. Fujita T. Ezaki O. Aizawa S.

We investigated the effect of thiazolidinediones on the regulation of AQPap gene transcription in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Incubation with thiazolidinediones augmented the amount of AQPap mRNA and the promoter activity (−497/+63) in a dose-dependent fashion (Fig.3, A and B). To determine the function of the AQPap gene promoter as well as its putative PPRE, transient reporter assays using various AQPap gene promoter constructs were performed in 3T3-L1 adipocytes (Fig.3 C). Serial deletion showed that the basal levels and the PGZ-mediated induction of luciferase activities were highly maintained when the constructs contained the region of −141/−14. The construct −14/+63, which lacked the region of −141/−14, including the putative PPRE, reduced the basal activity and abolished the response to PGZ (Fig. 3 C). To determine the further significance of the putative PPRE in the promoter of AQPap gene, we generated a construct lacking PPRE region (−93/−77) specifically from the wild-type construct (−141/+63) (Fig.4 A), and compared the response to various stimuli between the wild-type (−141/+63) and pAQPap PPRE-deleted constructs (Fig. 4 A). Fig. 4 B showed the effect of PGZ, 9-cis-RA, and Wy14643, which are the specific ligands for PPARγ, RXRα, and PPARα, respectively, on the luciferase activities of three constructs in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes and adipocytes. These compounds did not induce the reporter activities in the preadipocytes (Fig. 4 B, left). PGZ enhanced the luciferase activity of the wild-type construct in 3T3-L1 adipocytes (Fig. 4 B, right), similar to the data in Fig.3 B, and further increase was observed when 9-cis-RA was added (Fig. 4 B, right). Neither 9-cis-RA nor Wy14643 alone induced the luciferase activity in the wild-type construct (Fig. 4 B,right). The pAQPap PPRE-deleted construct had a lower basal luciferase activity, and the responses to the treatment of PGZ were totally abolished (Fig. 4 B, right). Fig.4 C clarified the effect of each reagent on the wild-type AQPap gene promoter construct (−141/+63) in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes. The ectopic expression of PPARγ increased the basal luciferase activities of the wild-type construct (lane 9 versus lane 1). PGZ treatment induced the luciferase activities when the preadipocytes were transfected with PPARγ expression construct (lanes 11, 12, 15, and 16). Co-expression of RXR with PPARγ further increased the PGZ-induced luciferase activities (lanes 15 and 16). Addition of 9-cis-RA augmented this increase (lane 12 compared with lane 11, and lane 16 compared withlane 15). These results indicate that the wild-type AQPap promoter activities were enhanced by PGZ in the preadipocyte when they expressed PPARγ. PPARγ’s partner for transcriptional activation is RXRα (23Mangelsdorf D.J. Evans R.M. Cell. 1995; 83: 841-850Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2843) Google Scholar). To determine whether PPARγ binds to the AQPap PPRE as complexes with RXRα, gel mobility shift assays were performed with double-stranded oligonucleotides containing the AQPap PPRE (Fig.5, A and C). Transient reporter assays using AQPap PPREwt or PPREmut, which is 3-base substitution mutant constructs, were performed in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes (Fig. 5, A and B). These 3-base substitutions have been described previously to diminish the binding of PPARγ to PPRE in the FATP1 gene promoter (14Frohnert B.I. Hui T.Y. Bernlohr D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3970-3977Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). Transfection of PPARγ·RXRα led to 3.5-fold stimulation of luciferase activity of the wild-type PPRE reporter construct (−141/+63) (Fig. 5 B,lane 3). Addition of PGZ and 9-cis-RA resulted in further 3-fold increase of luciferase activity (lane 4). The 3-base substitution mutation in the AQPap PPRE abolished the response to PPARγ·RXRα expression, and addition of PGZ/9-cis-RA (Fig. 5 B, lanes 7 and 8). The32P-radiolabeled double-stranded PPREwt oligonucleotides were incubated with in vitro translated PPARγ protein (Fig. 5 C). Neither PPARγ nor RXRα alone bound to AQPap PPRE (lanes 2 and 3). When PPARγ and RXRα were produced together, the mobility of 32P-radiolabeled PPRE oligonucleotides were shifted to higher range, which indicated the binding of PPARγ·RXRα complex to the AQPap PPRE (lane 4). The addition of excessive unlabeled PPREwt oligonucleotides reduced the signal of the 32P-radiolabeled PPREwt oligonucleotides’ binding to PPARγ·RXRα complex in a dose-dependent manner (lanes 5–7). On the other hand, addition of PPREmut oligonucleotides, which were not supposed to bind to the PPARγ·RXRα complex, did not reduce the specific signal (lanes 8–10). These results demonstrate the specific binding of PPARγ·RXRα complex to the AQPap PPRE. To further confirm the PPARγ-dependent enhancement of AQPap gene expression, we generated the dominant negative PPARγ expression constructs (Fig.6 A). In the other nuclear receptor-type transcriptional factors, the mutant construct lacking carboxyl AF-2 domain possessed the dominant negative effect on the transcription of the target genes (24Schulman I.G.

The model assumes a hazard of infection proportional to the incidence of bovine spongiform encephalopathy in the United Kingdom and accounts for precautionary control measures and very wide ranges of incubation periods. The model indicates that current case data are compatible with numbers of infections ranging from a few hundred to several millions. In the latter case, the model suggests that the mean incubation period must be well beyond the human life-span, resulting in disease epidemics of at most several thousand cases."

Quantum close-coupling scattering calculations on ab initio coupled-cluster CCSD(T) and CEPA (correlated electron pair approximation) potential energy surfaces were also performed. Although small discrepancies were found for the DeltaOmega = 1 transitions, we find marked agreement between theory and experiment for the collision dynamics of this system, which is the paradigm for the collisional relaxation of a molecular radical."
https://openalex.org/W2084384135,"One of the key morphological changes associated with the nerve growth factor (NGF)-induced differentiation of rat adrenal pheochromocytoma (PC-12) cells is the growth of axon-like processes called neurites. A growing body of evidence suggests that this process may be dependent upon plasmin, a serine protease generated from plasminogen (Plg) by either urokinase Plg activator (u-PA) or tissue Plg activator (t-PA). Prior work in our laboratory has identified annexin II (Ann-II) as a co-receptor for Plg and t-PA that promotes and localizes plasmin generation near the cell surface. In the present study, we report a 3–9-fold increase in Ann-II protein and message levels in NGF-treated PC-12 cells. Message stability and nuclear run-on assays suggest that this induction occurs at the level of gene transcription. Neurite outgrowth assays on and within a three-dimensional matrix demonstrate the inhibition of NGF-induced PC-12 cell differentiation by polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies directed against Ann-II as well as by the overexpression of antisense Ann-II mRNA. Neuritogenesis is also impaired by α2-plasmin inhibitor, antibodies directed against t-PA and u-PA, and ε-aminocaproic acid, a lysine analog that inhibits Plg activation and the binding of Plg to Ann-II. Plasmin generation assays reveal a 2-fold increase in plasmin production on NGF-treated PC-12 cells, which can be blocked by a polyclonal antibody directed against the tail region of Ann-II. From these data, we conclude that Ann-II is transcriptionally up-regulated by NGF and that Ann-II-mediated plasmin generation may play an important role during neurite development in the differentiating PC-12 cell.

The binding of NGF to a receptor tyrosine kinase encoded by the trkA proto-oncogene initiates a signal transduction cascade that halts cell proliferation and induces a new program of gene expression and protein synthesis (1Kaplan D.R. Hempstead B.L. Martin-Zanca D. Chao M.V. Parada L.F. Science. 1991; 252: 554-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (1142) Google Scholar). Gene targeting studies have demonstrated the importance of NGF to neuronal survival and function; mice completely deficient in either NGF (2Crowley C. Spencer S.D. Nishimura M.C. Chen K.S.

The disruption of even one NGF gene allele gives rise to significant memory and learning deficits that can be minimized by the administration of exogenous NGF (4Chen K.S. Nishimura M.C. Armanini M.P. Crowley C. Spencer S.D. Phillips H.S. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 7288-7296Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The addition of NGF to rat adrenal pheochromocytoma (PC-12) cells leads to cell cycle arrest and differentiation into cells resembling sympathetic neurons. Phenotypic changes associated with NGF-induced differentiation include the biosynthesis of neurotransmitters, the acquisition of electrical excitability, and the growth of axon-like extensions called neurites through a process known as neuritogenesis (5Greene L.A. Tischler A.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1976; 73: 2424-2428Crossref PubMed Scopus (4873) Google Scholar). Neuritogenesis is a complex phenomenon that involves multiple interactions between the growing neurite and the extracellular matrix. The extent and direction of neurite outgrowth is largely influenced by proteolytic activity, which regulates the neurite's adhesive properties and carves a channel in the extracellular matrix through which the neurite can grow (6Sumi Y. Dent M.A. Owen D.E. Seeley P.J. Morris R.J. Development. 1992; 116: 625-637PubMed Google Scholar). There is abundant evidence that proteolytic activity near the neurite-extracellular matrix interface may be mediated in part by the serine proteases, urokinase plasminogen activator (u-PA) and tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA) (6Sumi Y. Dent M.A. Owen D.E. Seeley P.J. Morris R.J. Development. 1992; 116: 625-637PubMed Google Scholar, 7Krystosek A. Seeds N.W.

In the vascular fibrinolytic system, u-PA and t-PA help to maintain blood fluidity by converting plasminogen (Plg) into plasmin, a serine protease whose major physiological role is the degradation of fibrin-rich intravascular thrombi (10Hajjar K.A. Nathan D.G. Orkin S.H. Hematology of Infancy and Childhood. W. B. Saunders Co., Philadelphia1997: 1557-1573Google Scholar). Within the developing nervous system, the expression of t-PA and u-PA is restricted to migrating tissues such as cerebellar granule cells (11Seeds N.W. Haffke S. Christensen K. Schoonmaker J. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 1990; 265: 169-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) and neural crest cells (6Sumi Y. Dent M.A. Owen D.E. Seeley P.J. Morris R.J. Development. 1992; 116: 625-637PubMed Google Scholar) and to regions of axonal growth such as the floor plate of the spinal cord (6Sumi Y. Dent M.A. Owen D.E. Seeley P.J. Morris R.J. Development. 1992; 116: 625-637PubMed Google Scholar, 8Dent M.A. Sumi Y. Morris R.J. Seeley P.J. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1993; 5: 633-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Plg activators are also found on the neurites of differentiating rat sympathetic neurons (12Pittman R.N. Ivins J.K. Buettner H.M. J. Neurosci. 1989; 9: 4269-4286Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), neuroblastoma cells (7Krystosek A. Seeds N.W. Science. 1981; 213: 1532-1534Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar), and PC-12 cells (13Leprince P. Rogister B. Delrée P. Rigo J.M. André B. Moonen G. J. Neurochem. 1991; 57: 665-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The high level of Plg activators observed in neuronal tissues suggests that, in this environment, they may be involved in processes other than the degradation of fibrin. Indeed, the overexpression of t-PA in cultured PC-12 cells results in enhanced neurite regeneration that can be blocked with anti-t-PA antibodies (9Pittman R.N. Di Benedetto A.J. J. Neurochem. 1995; 64: 566-575Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The up-regulation of t-PA expression in the rat brain has been observed in response to long term potentiation, chemically induced seizures, and an electrically induced form of epilepsy called kindling (14Qian Z. Gilbert M.E. Colicos M.A. Kandel E.R. Kuhl D. Nature. 1993; 361: 453-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (644) Google Scholar). Increased levels of t-PA message and protein are also observed in the cerebellar Purkinje neurons of rats that have been trained to perform a complex task (15Seeds N.W. Williams B.L. Bickford P.C. Science. 1995; 270: 1992-1994Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). Moreover, it has been shown that inhibitors of t-PA can block chemically induced long term potentiation and axonal elongation in the hippocampus, whereas the addition of exogenous t-PA has the opposite effect (16Baranes D. Lederfein D. Huang Y.Y. Chen M. Bailey C.H. Kandel E.R. Neuron. 1998; 21: 813-825Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). Together, these studies suggest that the induction of t-PA expression may play a role in neuronal plasticity and synaptic remodeling within the hippocampus and cerebellum during memory formation and motor learning. In previous studies using human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC), we have identified annexin II (Ann-II) as an extracellular co-receptor for Plg and t-PA that enhances t-PA-dependent Plg activation nearly 60-fold in a purified system (17Hajjar K.A. Jacovina A.T. Chacko J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21191-21197Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18Cesarman G.M. Guevara C.A. Hajjar K.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21198-21203Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Ann-II is a 36-kDa member of the annexin gene family, a group of ∼20 Ca2+- and phospholipid-binding proteins that consist of a conserved carboxyl-terminal core domain and a variable amino-terminal tail domain (19Hajjar K.A. Krishnan S. Trends Cardiovasc. Med. 1999; 9: 128-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Ann-II is expressed on the surface of smooth muscle cells, glioma cells (20Chung C.Y. Erickson H.P. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 539-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar), endothelial cells (17Hajjar K.A. Jacovina A.T. Chacko J. J. Biol.

Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 539-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar), and acute promyelocytic leukemia cells (21Menell J.S. Cesarman G.M. Jacovina A.T. McLaughlin M.A. Lev E.A. Hajjar K.A. N. Engl. J. Med. 1999; 340: 994-1004Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). Its expression is developmentally regulated in the chicken lens (22Talian J.C. Zelenka P.S. Dev. Biol. 1991; 143: 68-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar), the rat cerebellum (23Burgoyne R.D. Cambray-Deakin M.A. Norman K.M. J. Mol. Neurosci. 1989; 1: 47-54Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and the murine central nervous system (24Hamre K.M. Chepenik K.P. Goldowitz D. J. Comp. Neurol. 1995; 352: 421-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). One of the unique features of Ann-II is its ability to form a heterotetramer with p11, aMr 11,000 member of the S100 calcium-binding protein family. The p11 subunit binds to the amino-terminal tail region of the Ann-II monomer and is thought to regulate the heterotetramer's affinity for phospholipids (25Weber K. Moss S.E. The Annexins. Portland Press, London1992: 61-68Google Scholar). Recent reports suggest that the heterotetramer or even p11 itself may also stimulate t-PA-dependent plasmin generation (26Kassam G. Le B.H. Choi K.S. Kang H.M. Fitzpatrick S.L. Louie P. Waisman D.M. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 16958-16966Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Previous work done in our laboratory suggests that Ann-II may act as a scaffold for the generation of plasmin near the cell surface by forming a membrane-bound ternary complex with Plg and t-PA. We have shown that Plg binding to Ann-II is inhibited by the lysine analog ε-aminocaproic acid (εACA) (18Cesarman G.M. Guevara C.A. Hajjar K.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21198-21203Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and requires a carboxyl-terminal lysine residue in the core domain (17Hajjar K.A. Jacovina A.T. Chacko J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21191-21197Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The binding of t-PA to Ann-II involves the N-terminal tail domain and is inhibited by homocysteine, a proatherothrombotic amino acid that accumulates as a result of inborn errors of metabolism and certain nutritional deficiencies (27Hajjar K.A. Mauri L. Jacovina A.T. Zhong F. Mirza U.A. Padovan J.C. Chait B.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9987-9993Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). There is evidence in the literature that Ann-II may be involved in neuronal cell differentiation and development. In the developing murine nervous system, Ann-II is detected in dorsal root ganglion cells, sensory ganglion cell axons, and midline structures throughout the developing spinal cord, brain stem, and mesencephalon (24Hamre K.M. Chepenik K.P. Goldowitz D. J. Comp. Neurol. 1995; 352: 421-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). In PC-12 cells, NGF-induced differentiation is accompanied by increased Ann-II expression at the message and protein levels (28Schlaepfer D.D. Haigler H.T. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 229-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 29Fox M.T. Prentice D.A. Hughes J.P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 177: 1188-1193Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Moreover, the overexpression of p11 results in the constitutive outgrowth of neurites in PC-12 cells (30Masiakowski P. Shooter E.M. J. Neurosci. Res. 1990; 27: 264-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). In the present study, we examine the relationship between the expression of cell surface Ann-II, Ann-II-mediated plasminogen activation, and neuritogenesis during NGF-induced PC-12 cell differentiation.

Biol. 1990; 10: 5324-5332Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar) were generously provided by Dr. Harry Lander (Weill Medical College of Cornell University) and were cultured in the same manner as wild type PC-12 cells. PC-12 cells treated with NGF were grown on plastic wells or flasks that had been precoated with rat tail collagen (Biomedical Technologies). All cultures were maintained in a humidified chamber (37 °C, 5% CO2). PC-12 cells were treated daily for 5 days with or without 50 ng/ml NGF. EGTA cell surface eluates were prepared and assayed for the release of lactate dehydrogenase as previously described (33Hajjar K.A. Guevara C.A. Lev E. Dowling K. Chacko J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21652-21659Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Whole cell lysates of the EGTA-eluted cells were prepared by two freeze-thaw cycles (−80 °C) in ice-cold radioimmune precipitation buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.1% SDS, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, pH 8.0). The eluates and lysates were centrifuged (10,000 × g, 10 min), assayed for protein content, and analyzed for Ann-II content by SDS-PAGE/Western blot analysis as previously described (34Hajjar K.A. Hamel N.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 2908-2916Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). An enhanced chemiluminescence kit (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.) was used according to the manufacturer's protocol to detect p11. Western blot data were scanned and saved as digital images using Adobe Photoshop version 4.0.1 (Adobe Systems). The detection of cell surface Ann-II by indirect immunofluorescence microscopy was performed as previously described (21Menell J.S. Cesarman G.M. Jacovina A.T. McLaughlin M.A. Lev E.A. Hajjar K.A. N. Engl. J. Med. 1999; 340: 994-1004Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). PC-12 cells treated with 50 ng/ml NGF for 5 days were stained with monoclonal anti-Ann-II (1.25 μg/ml) or anti-Ann-VI (1.25 μg/ml) and counterstained with propidium iodide. PC-12 cells were treated with or without 50 ng/ml NGF or 50 ng/ml EGF for 3 days. Total RNA was isolated from HUVEC and PC-12 cells using Trizol reagent (Life Technologies). Equal amounts of RNA were resolved on an agarose gel and transferred to Zetaprobe (Bio-Rad) membranes as previously described (35Chacko G. Ling Q. Hajjar K.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19840-19846Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The membranes were hybridized to a 32P-labeled probe in QuickHyb solution (Stratagene) and subjected to autoradiography. The autoradiograms were scanned and digitized using Adobe Photoshop and analyzed by densitometry using the Scion Image (beta 3 version) software package (Scion Corp.). Probes for Northern hybridization were made with a random primed labeling kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). The template for a 300-bp human Ann-II tail-specific cDNA probe was prepared as previously described (21Menell J.S. Cesarman G.M. Jacovina A.T. McLaughlin M.A. Lev E.A. Hajjar K.A. N. Engl. J.

A cDNA probe specific for human annexin I (Ann-I) was synthesized by PCR in a 100-μl volume containing 200 μm dNTPs, 2.5 units of Pfu polymerase (Stratagene), 50 pmol of primers, and a HUVEC λ-gt11 cDNA library (36Ye R.D. Wun T.C. Sadler J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 3718-3725Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) as a template. The forward primer, 5′-AAAGGATCCGGCAATGGTATCAGAATT-3′, contained a BamHI site and bases 3–20 of the human Ann-I sequence (37Wallner B.P. Mattaliano R.J. Hession C. Cate R.L. Tizard R. Sinclair L.K. Foeller C. Chow E.P. Browning J.L. Ramachandran K.L. Pepinsky R.B. Nature. 1986; 320: 77-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (510) Google Scholar), while the reverse primer, 5′-AAACTCGAGGTTTCCTCCACAAAGAGC-3′ contained anXhoI site and Ann-I bases 1021–1038. The PCR consisted of five cycles of 94 °C (30 s), 52 °C (60 s), and 72 °C (90 s), followed by 25 cycles of 94 °C (30 s), 74 °C (60 s), and 72 °C (90 s) and concluded with a 72 °C incubation (5 min). The 1035-bp PCR product was digested with BamHI and XhoI, cloned into pET 21b, and sequenced in both directions to verify its integrity. The template for a 28 S rRNA probe was generously provided by Dr. Iris Gonzales (Hahneman University, Philadelphia, PA), and an 18 S rRNA probe was purchased from Promega. PC-12 cells were starved in low serum Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (0.5% calf serum, 1% horse serum) for 48 h and treated for an additional 48 h with no growth factor or with either 50 ng/ml EGF or 50 ng/ml NGF. The culture medium was replaced with low serum Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 4 μg/ml actinomycin D, and the cells were harvested after 0, 3, 6, 9, 12, and 24 h. Total RNA was purified and analyzed by Northern blot and densitometry. The relative amounts of normalized Ann-II message were plotted as a function of time, and the slope of this curve was used to calculate the interval within which half of the original message had disappeared. Nuclear run-on assays of untreated and NGF-treated PC-12 cells were performed as described (35Chacko G. Ling Q. Hajjar K.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19840-19846Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). To construct pMEP4-AS, a 365-bp BglII-HindIII fragment containing bases 33–397 of the human Ann-II cDNA sequence (38Huang K.S. Wallner B.P. Mattaliano R.J. Tizard R. Burne C. Frey A. Hession C.

Chem. 1994; 269: 21191-21197Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and subcloned in the antisense orientation into the HindIII-BamHI sites of the zinc-inducible expression vector, pMEP4 (Invitrogen). The Ann-II sense insert for pMEP4-S was amplified from pCMV5-Ann-II in a 100-μl PCR. The forward primer, 5′-GGGCTGGCGGTACCCCAGCTTCCTTCAAAATGTC-3′ contained a restriction site for KpnI and Ann-II bases 34–54, and the reverse primer, 5′-ATTGAGAGAGTCCTCGTCGG-3′ contained bases 417–436. The PCR consisted of 25 cycles of 94 °C (1 min), 56 °C (1 min), and 72 °C (2 min) followed by a 5-min incubation at 72 °C. The 403-bp PCR product was digested withKpnI and HindIII, and the resulting 367-bp fragment was cloned in the sense orientation into pMEP4. The integrity of the PCR-derived pMEP4-S insert was confirmed by DNA sequencing in both directions. PC-12 cells were propagated in six-well plates and transfected in serum-free medium for 6 h with 24 μl of LipofectAMINE plus 2 μg of pMEP4-AS or pMEP4-S plasmid DNA. Following transfection, the cells were allowed to recover in complete medium for 48 h. Selection for stable transfectants was carried out for several weeks in complete medium containing 400 μg/ml hygromycin B. The presence of the pMEP4 vector in these cells was verified by both PCR and Southern blot analysis. PC-12 cells were propagated on a two-dimensional rat tail collagen substrate in 12-well plates and treated with 50 ng/ml NGF for 2–5 days in the presence of anti-annexin antibodies or εACA. Three-dimensional matrices were prepared by diluting Matrigel reconstituted basement membrane (Collaborative Biomedical Products) 1:1 with a PC-12 cell suspension in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. Fifty μl of this mixture (5000 cells) was placed onto each well of a 48-well plate and allowed to gel for 30 min in a humidified chamber (37 °C, 5% CO2). The embedded cells were fed for 3 days with medium containing 50 ng/ml NGF plus α2-plasmin inhibitor or specific antibodies. Morphological changes indicative of differentiation were observed using phase contrast microscopy at ×100 magnification. For each treatment group, the percentage of cells bearing neurites at least two cell bodies in length was enumerated in a double-blind manner by two observers. PC-12 cells were cultured upon rat tail collagen in six-well plates (Costar) in the presence or absence of 50 ng/ml NGF for 5 days. Cells were incubated for 3 h in complete medium containing preimmune rabbit IgG or polyclonal Ann-II tail peptide antibody. The cells were washed three times with IB buffer (140 mm NaCl, 4 mm KCl, 10 mm HEPES, 0.2% glucose, 1 mmMgCl2, 3 mm CaCl2) containing 10 mm εACA and lightly fixed for 30 min at 37 °C with 0.02% glutaraldehyde in IB buffer (31Hajjar K.A. Harpel P.C. Jaffe E.A. Nachman R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 11656-11662Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The cells were then washed five times with IB buffer and treated with 100 nm Glu-Plg for 1 h at room temperature. The plate was washed five times, and 1 ml of IB buffer containing 10 nm t-PA premixed with the fluorogenic plasmin substrate AFC-81 (d-Val-Leu-Lys-7-amino-4-trifluoromethylcoumarin; 125 μm) was added to each well. Substrate hydrolysis was measured at 2-min intervals as relative fluorescence units at 400-nm excitation and 505-nm emission in a SpectraMax Gemini XS fluorescent spectrometer (Molecular Devices). Initial rates of plasmin generation were calculated using linear regression analysis of plots of relative fluorescence units versus time2 as previously described (31Hajjar K.A. Harpel P.C. Jaffe E.A. Nachman R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 11656-11662Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In a previous study using HUVEC (33Hajjar K.A. Guevara C.A. Lev E. Dowling K. Chacko J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21652-21659Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar), we were able to differentiate between cell surface and cytosolic Ann-II by eluting the cell monolayer with 10 mm EGTA, a chelator that disrupts the Ca2+-dependent binding of Ann-II to the cell surface. In the present study, we used a similar strategy to compare levels of Ann-II expression in EGTA cell surface eluates and whole cell lysates prepared from PC-12 cells treated with or without 50 ng/ml NGF for 5 days (Fig.1A). The EGTA cell surface eluates were tested as described under “Experimental Procedures” for the presence of lactate dehydrogenase, an enzyme that resides solely in the cytoplasm. The results of this assay revealed no evidence of reduced cellular integrity during the EGTA elution (data not shown) and provided assurance that the Ann-II detected in the eluates originated on the outer surface of the cell. We observed low levels of Ann-II protein in either fraction prepared from untreated PC-12 cells. However, significantly increased amounts of Ann-II protein were found in both cell surface eluates and whole cell lysates prepared from the NGF-treated cells. Detectable levels of p11 were not found in the eluted fraction of either treatment group (Fig.1B). However, we observed a dramatic increase in p11 expression in the whole cell lysates of NGF-treated cells. These data confirmed previous reports of increased Ann-II expression in differentiating PC-12 cells (28Schlaepfer D.D. Haigler H.T. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 229-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 29Fox M.T. Prentice D.A. Hughes J.P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 177: 1188-1193Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), and they also demonstrated the abundant presence of Ann-II protein on the surface of NGF-treated PC-12 cells. These findings were corroborated by an immunohistochemical analysis (Fig. 1C) of NGF-treated PC-12 cells subjected to cell surface staining with a monoclonal anti-Ann-II antibody. In these experiments, we observed Ann-II expression localized to the plasma membrane and neurites. Cells stained with anti-Ann-VI (Fig.1D), on the other hand, showed no immunofluorescent staining. To determine whether the increased expression of Ann-II protein in NGF-treated PC-12 cells reflected an increase in steady state mRNA levels, we performed Northern blot analysis of total RNA extracted from PC-12 cells treated with or without 50 ng/ml NGF for 5 days. In response to NGF, Ann-II but not Ann-I message levels were elevated (Fig.2A), suggesting that the up-regulatory effect of NGF was specific for Ann-II and not for other members of the annexin family. The Ann-II response to NGF was dose-dependent (Fig. 2B) and displayed a time course (Fig. 2C) that began within 3 h after the addition of the neurotrophin. Maximal induction was attained by 12 h, whereupon it remained relatively steady for 5 days. The up-regulatory effect of NGF upon Ann-II was observed only in wild type PC-12 cells (Fig. 2D). Although HUVEC possessed higher basal levels of Ann-II than PC-12 cells, they did not exhibit increased Ann-II expression in response to NGF. Likewise, we observed no increase in Ann-II message in NGF-treated N17 cells, a PC-12 cell line that expresses a dominant negative mutant form of p21ras and is"

ATM, the product of the ATM gene, is a member of a family of large proteins kinases found in various organisms, which share a carboxyl-terminal phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-like domain (4Rotman G. Shiloh Y. Oncogene. 1999; 186: 6135-6144Crossref Scopus (230) Google Scholar). ATM is a serine/threonine protein kinase that mediates the activation of multiple signal transduction pathways following the induction of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) (4Rotman G. Shiloh Y.

Cells derived from A-T patients and Atm-deficient mice exhibit genomic instability, extreme sensitivity to DNA breaking agents, and a broad defect in the activation of the cell cycle checkpoints and other pathways by DSBs (4Rotman G. Shiloh Y. Oncogene. 1999; 186: 6135-6144Crossref Scopus (230) Google Scholar, 5Shiloh Y. Kastan M.B. Adv. Cancer Res. 2001; 83: 210-253Google Scholar). However, A-T cells are not sensitive to UV light or to replication inhibitors. To activate the cell cycle checkpoints and to modulate DNA repair, ATM phosphorylates a number of downstream targets, including p53, Mdm2, Brca1, Chk2, and Nbs1 (reviewed in Refs. 11Kastan M.B. Lim D.-S. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 1: 179-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (648) Google Scholar and 12Kahanna K.K. Jackson S.P. Nat. Genet. 2001; 27: 247-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (1847) Google Scholar). ATM can be activated by DSBs that occur during meiosis or V(D)J recombination, or by internal or external DNA damaging agents, such as ionizing radiation, radiomimetic chemicals, and reactive oxygen species. There is evidence of the ability of ATM to bind to DNA in vitro (13Smith G.C. Cary R.B. Lakin N.D. Hann B.C. Teo S.H. Chen D.J. Jackson S.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 11134-11139Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 14Suzuki K. Kodama S. Watanabe M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 25571-25575Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Recent evidence indicates that following the induction of DSBs, a fraction of ATM binds tightly to the chromatin, in accordance with the suggested role of ATM in the early steps of the DNA damage response (14Suzuki K. Kodama S. Watanabe M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 25571-25575Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Evidence is accumulating that ATM is involved in maintaining genomic stability under normal, apparently nonstressed conditions. In the murine developing nervous system, ATM appears to mediate ionizing radiation-induced death (16Herzog K.H. Chong M.J. Kapsetak M. Morgan J.I. McKinnon P.J. Science. 1998; 208: 1089-1091Crossref Scopus (367) Google Scholar). This finding led to the hypothesis that ATM functions during nervous system development to eliminate neuronal cells that suffered from genomic damage (16Herzog K.H. Chong M.J. Kapsetak M. Morgan J.I. McKinnon P.J. Science. 1998; 208: 1089-1091Crossref Scopus (367) Google Scholar). ATM was also shown to be required for the execution of apoptosis in all areas of the developing nervous system in a model of a DNA ligase IV-deficient mouse (17Lee Y. Barnes D.E. Lindhal T. McKinnon P.J. Gene Dev. 2000; 14: 2576-2580Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Genomic instability or accumulation of unrepaired DNA damage can lead to constant activation of the DNA repair mechanisms, resulting in depletion of pyridine nucleotides and ATP (reviewed in Ref. 41Herceg Z. Wang Z.-Q. Mutat. Res. 2001; 477: 97-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar). The mitochondria, which play a pivotal role in maintaining energetic homeostasis, are highly sensitive to stress conditions (18Cadenas E. Davis K.J.A. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2000; 29: 222-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (2273) Google Scholar). Thus, genomic integrity, pyridine nucleotide levels, and mitochondrial activity are highly interconnected and can be used to monitor the health of an animal, organ, or individual cells. Pyridine nucleotides are involved in numerous essential catabolic and biosynthetic reactions in living organisms (19Lehninger A.L. Nelson D.L. Cox M.M. Principles of Biochemistry. Worth, New York1993: 446-478Google Scholar). More than 200 enzymes are known to catalyze reactions in which NAD+ or NADP+ accept a hydride ion from reduced substrates or NADH or NADPH donates hydride ions to oxidized substrates. One of the important functions of NADH and NADPH is to provide reducing equivalents in reactions that are crucial for the antioxidant capacity of the cells. These include enzymes such as glutathione reductase, whose role is to reduce oxidized glutathione. In addition to NADH, NAD+ serves as a cofactor for enzymes such as PARP and SIR2, which are involved in DNA repair mechanisms and transcriptional silencing (20Lin S.-J Defossez P.-A. Guarente L. Science. 2000; 298: 2126-2128Crossref Scopus (1448) Google Scholar, 21Smith J.S. Brachmann-Baker C. Celic I. Jenna M.A. Muhammad S. Starati V.J. Avalos J.L. Escalante-Semerena J.A. Grubmeyer C.

Dis. 2000; 7: 225-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). Furthermore, NADPH was shown to bind and activate catalase, the enzyme that decomposes hydrogen peroxide (23Kaplan N.O. Curr. Top. Cell Regul. 1985; 26: 371-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 24Hoffschir F. Daya-Grosjean L. Petit P.X. Nocentini S. Dutrillaux B. Sarasin A. Vuillaume M. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1998; 24: 809-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Thus, the cellular concentrations of pyridine nucleotides, as well as the ratio of oxidized/reduced species, are crucial for maintenance of cellular and tissue homeostasis. In this study we used Atm-deficient mice to study the contribution of ATM to protection against neuronal DNA damage and to maintenance of cellular concentrations of pyridine nucleotides. Using TUNEL analysis, we show that loss of Atm leads to a progressive accumulation of DNA damage in the cerebellum. We also found a significant decrease in NAD+, NADH, and NADP+ levels in the brains of Atm(−/−) mice. These phenomena were progressive and observed primarily in the cerebellum of 4-month-old Atm-deficient mice. Interestingly, and contrary to the findings in the cerebellum, significantly higher levels of NADH and NAD+ and a higher NADH/NADT ratio were measured in the cerebrum than in the cerebellum of normal mice. Atm(+/−) mice (6Barlow C. Hirotsune S. Paylor R. Liyanage M. Eckhaus M. Collins F. Shiloh Y. Crawley J.N. Ried T. Tagle D. Wynshaw-Boris A.

Offspring of these mice were genotyped by PCR-based assays using mouse-tail DNA, prepared with the Bio-Ventures Co. GeneReleaserTM reagent (Bio-Ventures Co., Murfreesboro, TN). TUNEL analyses were performed on brain slices using the ApopTag Plus Peroxidase S7101 system according to the manufacturer's instructions (Intergen, Purchase, NY). The brains of 1- and 4-month-old mice (Atm(+/+) and Atm(−/−)) were fixed using whole body perfusion (2% formaldeyhde in 37.5 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, 75 mm lysine, and 10 mm sodium periodate (which was added just prior to the perfusion)), after which paraffin-embedded sections were prepared from each brain and subjected to TUNEL staining. Three randomly chosen sections from each brain were observed under the Olympus BX50 microscope and acquired with a Pixera (Los Gatos, CA) color camera (resolution 1280 × 1024 pixels, 24 bits RGB) interfaced to a G3 Macintosh (Apple). The digitalized (TIFF format images) TUNEL sections were processed using the histogram command (NIH image 1.62 software), which displays the gray value histograms produced by the command. This function shows, for each of the 256 possible gray values, the number of pixels within the selection that have values. Data were then normalized to frequency histogram. The resultant histograms were compared using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. Brain slices of 1- and 4-month-old mice (Atm(+/+) and Atm(−/−)) were deparaffinized by xylene and then rehydrated. After antigen retrieval, blocking, and quenching the internal peroxidase activity by hydrogen peroxide, the slices were incubated overnight with anti-caspase-3 antibodies (1:250 dilution, purified monoclonal rabbit anti-active caspase-3, catalog number 559565 BD, PharMingen). Antibody-antigen complexes were visualized using the histostain-plus kit according to the manufacturer's instructions ((Zymed Laboratories Inc., San Francisco, CA). After anesthetizing the mice by CO2-induced asphyxiation, brains were removed, washed with cold phosphate-buffered saline, quick frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −70 °C. Prior to assays, samples of cerebellum and cerebrum were thawed and homogenized (cerebellum in 1 ml and cerebrum in 2 ml) in a homogenization buffer containing 20 mm NaHCO3, 100 mmNa2CO3, and 10 mm nicotinamide (24Hoffschir F. Daya-Grosjean L. Petit P.X. Nocentini S. Dutrillaux B. Sarasin A. Vuillaume M. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1998; 24: 809-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The extracts were sonicated twice for 5 s and centrifuged for 1 h at 89,000 × g, after which the supernatants were collected and used for quantification of pyridine nucleotides. NAD+, NADP+, and their reduced forms were assayed using spectrophotometric enzymatic cycling assays, by slight modifications of previously described methods (25Nisselbaum J.S. Green S. Anal. Biochem. 1969; 27: 212-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar, 26Bernofsky C. Swan M. Anal. Biochem. 1973; 53: 452-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar, 27Zerez C.R. Lee S.J. Tanaka K.R. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 164: 367-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). To destroy the oxidized form of NAD+ and NADP+, a portion of the crude extract, or a standard containing a mixture of the nucleotides (each at a concentration of 10–80 pmol of NAD+ and 50–125 pmol of NADP+ in a total volume of 1 ml), were incubated at 60 °C for 30 min in a dry heating block and promptly chilled to 0 °C. Both heat-treated extracts contained NADH and NADPH, and the untreated preparations that contained the oxidized and reduced forms of the nucleotides were immediately analyzed for NAD+, NADH, NADP+, and NADPH. The reaction mixture for assaying NAD+ (27Zerez C.R. Lee S.J. Tanaka K.R. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 164: 367-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar) contained 100 μmol of Tris-HCl, pH 8, 2 μmol of phenazineethosulfate, 0.5 μmol of 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5 diphenyltetrazolium bromide, 0.2 mg of alcohol dehydrogenase (Sigma, catalog number A-3263), 600 μmol of ethanol, and extract of standards containing 10–80 pmol of NAD+ and/or NADH in a total volume of 1 ml. The NADP assay was a modification of the method of Nisselbaum and Green (24Hoffschir F. Daya-Grosjean L. Petit P.X. Nocentini S. Dutrillaux B. Sarasin A. Vuillaume M. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1998; 24: 809-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The reaction mixture contained 100 μmol of Tris-HCl, pH 8, 5 μmol of Na4EDTA, 2 μmol of phenazineethosulfate, 0.5 μmol of 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5 diphenyltetrazolium bromide, 1.3 IU glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (Sigma, catalog number G-4134), 1 μmol of glucose 6-phosphate, and extract containing 5–60 pmol of NADP+ and/or NADPH in total volume of 1 ml. EDTA was included to prevent the possible activation of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase by Mg2+ from the extracts. Reaction mixtures were preincubated for 5 min at 37 °C without ethanol or glucose 6-phosphate and were started by adding these substrates. Under these conditions, the rate of increase of absorbance at 570 nm was linear for at least 10 min and was proportional to the quantity of pyridine nucleotide present. In both assay systems, blanks without NAD+ or NADP+ were routinely performed to correct for background rates due to variable small quantities of tightly bound NAD+ and NADP+ in the alcohol dehydrogenase and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase preparations. Cerebral and cerebellar mitochondria were isolated from 4-month-old Atm(+/+) and Atm(−/−) animals by the method of Rosenthal et al. (28Rosenthal R.E. Hamud F. Fiskum G. Varghese P.J. Sharpe S. J. Cereb. Blood Flow Metab. 1987; 7: 752-758Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). In brief, the mice were decapitated and the cerebrum and cerebellum were rapidly removed, washed, minced, and homogenized in a Dounce glass tissue homogenizer (via six strokes each with a loose-fitting pestle and then a tight-fitting pestle) at 4 °C in 10 ml of isolation medium (225 mm mannitol, 75 mm sucrose, 5 mmHEPES, and 1 mm EGTA). Single cerebrum and cerebellum homogenates were brought to 15 ml and then centrifuged at 2,000 ×g for 3 min. The supernatants were centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 13 min. The pellets including the fluffy synaptosomal layer were resuspended in isolation medium and centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 15 min. The brown mitochondrial pellets without the synaptosomal layer were then resuspended again in 0.8 ml of cerebrum and 0.4 ml of cerebellum. Respiration measurements were determined polarographically with a thermostatically controlled (37 °C) Clark oxygen electrode (Yellow Springs Instrument Co., Yellow Springs, OH) according to the method of Rosenthal et al. (28Rosenthal R.E. Hamud F. Fiskum G. Varghese P.J. Sharpe S. J. Cereb. Blood Flow Metab. 1987; 7: 752-758Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar) in standard respiration medium containing 125 mm KCl, 2 mm K2HPO4, 1 mm MgCl2, 5 mm K-HEPES, pH 7.0, 1 mm EGTA, 100 mm glutamate, and 40 mm malate. Mitochondria (0.5 mg of protein/ml) were added to 0.4 ml of medium in a water-jacketed chamber (Gilson, Middleton, WI). Active state 3 respiration rates were determined by the addition of ADP (6.25 mm), and the resting state 4 rates were determined in the presence of malate and glutamate. Evaluation of state 3 and state 4 rates occurred over ∼3–5 min for each sample. Protein concentration was determined according to the method of Bradford (29Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 254-257Crossref Scopus (210377) Google Scholar) using bovine serum albumin as standard. Results were analyzed using two-tailed Student's t test. Data were expressed as mean ± S.E. and p values ≤ 0.05 were considered significant. Kolmogorov-Smirnov analysis was used to determine the statistical significance of the differeces in TUNEL staining between Atm(+/+) and Atm(−/−) cerebra and cerebella. p values ≤ 0.05 were considered significant. TUNEL staining detects free 3′-OH DNA ends of single- and double-strand DNA breaks and therefore serves as a semiquantitative assay for cells undergoing DNA damage or apoptosis (30Gavrieli Y. Sherman Y. Ben-Sasson S.A. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 493-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (9087) Google Scholar). Stronger TUNEL staining reflects higher levels of DNA breaks. To determine whether loss of Atm may lead to ongoing accumulation of DNA breaks, we applied the TUNEL assay to brain slices from Atm(−/−) and Atm(+/+) mice and monitored the intensity of the staining. Clear differences were observed between the two genotypes in the staining intensities of cerebellar slices from 4-month-old mice (Fig. 1C), while 1-month-old mice exhibited less pronounced differences between the genotypes. The brain areas on which the TUNEL analysis was performed are shown in Fig. 1, A and B. We focused on the granular layer of the cerebellum and cortical and subcortical layers of the cerebrum. The quantification of the TUNEL staining was obtained by calculating the average intensity of the pixels in each nucleus. These values were then normalized to the frequency histogram, which represents the percentage of nuclei that have these values. At the age of 1 month, a small but nonsignificant increase in TUNEL staining was observed in Atm(−/−) cerebella compared with their control littermates (Fig.2A). Whereas 0.11% (we have arbitrarily chosen to focus on OD = 80, calculated by integrating the histograms, since the amount of cells displaying the OD values in control samples is very low) of the total TUNEL-stained cells in Atm(+/+) cerebellum displayed a higher level of TUNEL staining, 0.8% of the cells in Atm(−/−) cerebellum showed similar or stronger TUNEL staining. However, the inset plot (Fig. 2A) shows that these differences are not statistically significant. The differences in TUNEL staining were progressive and intensified with age. Fig. 2B shows a clear distinction between the two peaks where the TUNEL staining of Atm(−/−) cerebella is stronger compared with Atm(+/+) littermates. The number of cells that displayed TUNEL staining stronger than OD = 80 in 4-month-old Atm(+/+) cerebella was slightly increased and reached 0.46%. On the other hand, 3.2% of the cells in Atm(−/−) cerebella showed similar or stronger TUNEL staining (Fig. 2B). These differences are statistically significant as shown in the inset plot (p < 0.01). Interestingly, 9.9% of the TUNEL-stained cells in young (1 month) Atm(−/−) cerebra showed stronger TUNEL staining compared with 0.25% of the cells in their Atm(+/+) littermates (Fig.3A). At an older age (4 months), the Atm(−/−) cerebra seemed to recover, and the number of cells that displayed a high level of TUNEL staining was reduced to 0.58% compared with 0.075% of the cells in the Atm(+/+) cerebra (Fig.3B). The TUNEL staining in 1-month- and 4-month-old Atm-deficient cerebra was significantly stronger than in their Atm(+/+) littermates (inset plots; p < 0.01 andp < 0.05, respectively). To test whether stronger TUNEL staining is accompanied by the activation of apoptotic pathways, we stained the brain slices with anti-active caspase-3 antibodies. We found no signs of caspase-3 activation in either Atm(−/−) or their Atm(+/+) littermates, suggesting that Atm loss leads to DNA damage but not to the activation of caspase-3-dependent apoptotic pathways (data not shown). Taken together, our findings indicate that DNA breaks in the cerebellum accumulate with age, whereas the cerebrum recovers progressively from an early onset of DNA breaks. Accumulation of DNA breaks detected in the Atm-deficient cerebella often resulted in the depletion of pyridine nucleotides, especially NAD+ (reviewed in Ref. 31Hageman G.J. Stierum R.H. Mutat. Res. 2001; 475: 45-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). To test whether Atm deficiency can alter the levels of pyridine nucleotides, NADT (i.e. NADH + NAD+) levels were assayed in cerebella and cerebra of Atm(−/−) and control animals as described under “Materials and Methods.” At 4 months of age, a significant reduction in cerebellar levels of NADT was observed in Atm(−/−) mice compared with their Atm(+/+) littermates (42%, p < 0.01) (Fig.4B). Both the reduced form (NADH) and the oxidized form (NAD+) were lower in these mice (32%, p < 0.024; 52%, p < 0.0074, respectively). At the age of 1 month, however, no differences could be detected in NADH and NAD+ between Atm(−/−) and Atm(+/+) cerebella (Fig. 4A). A lower NADH/NAD+ratio was measured in 4-month-old Atm(−/−) cerebella compared with control mice (0.29 and 0.43, p = 0.15). On the other hand, no differences in NADH or NAD+ levels in the cerebra of Atm(−/−) mice and their control littermates could be observed (Fig. 4, C and D). These results demonstrate a progressive reduction in the levels of NADT in Atm(−/−) mice, which is specific to the cerebellum and may result in impaired cellular homeostasis. Interestingly, in 4-month-old Atm(+/+) mice, cerebral NADTand NADH levels were found to be significantly higher than the cerebellar levels in same-age Atm(+/+) mice (1.95-fold increase,p < 0.033, and 3.9-fold increase, p < 0.008, respectively) (Fig. 4, B and D). Similar to NADT, a significant reduction in NADPT levels (28%, p < 0.044) and NADP+ (37%, p < 0.003) was observed in the cerebella of 4-month-old Atm(−/−) mice. This change was the result of a significant decrease in NADP+ (37%p < 0.003) with no change in NADPH (Fig.5A). Consequently, the cerebella of Atm(−/−) mice displayed a higher ratio of NADPH/NADP+ compared with their Atm(+/+) littermates (Fig.5). No such changes were observed in 4-month-old Atm(−/−) cerebra (Fig. 5B). Accumulation of DNA breaks and reduced levels of pyridine nucleotides in Atm(−/−) cerebella can affect mitochodrial respiration. These findings led us to test whether Atm loss affects mitochondrial oxygen consumption. To do so we measured mitochondrial respiration rates in cerebellar and cerebral tissues of Atm(−/−) and Atm(+/+) mice. Fig. 6 shows that mitochondria isolated from Atm(−/−) cerebra exhibit a significantly lower rate of active respiration as calculated by the ratio of state 3 to state 4 (19% reduction, p < 0.016). State 3, termed active respiration, is defined as respiration in the presence of an oxidizable substrate and ADP and is thus a measure of the respiration coupled to ATP synthesis. State 4, or resting respiration, is the rate of respiration in the presence of substrate but in the absence of ADP and is thus a measure of the rate of respiration that is not coupled to ATP synthesis. In contrast, a significantly higher mitochondrial respiration rate was observed in Atm(−/−) cerebra (52% increase, p < 0.026). It is possible that Atm(−/−) cerebella, which are under constant stress, increase mitochondrial activity to maintain cellular homeostasis. Several human genetic disorders involving defects in DNA damage responses are also characterized by neurological deficits. Among these are xeroderma pigmantosum, Nijmegan breakage syndrome, trichothiodystrophy, cockayne syndrome, and A-T, which is a prominent example (for review, see Ref. 32Roling R.L. McKinnon P.J. Trends Neurosci. 2000; 23: 417-424Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, however, Atm(−/−) mice do not show overt neurological deficits except in one report that showed abnormal differentiation in Purkinje cells and motor deficits in Atm(−/−) mice (10Borghesani P.R. Alt F.W. Bottaro A. Davidson L. Aksoy S. Rathbun G.A. Roberts T.M. Swat W. Segal R.A. Gu Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 3336-3341Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Using computerized TUNEL analysis, we were able to provide evidence of a progressive accumulation of DNA breaks in the brains of Atm-deficient mice. Our findings cannot, however, distinguish between single or double-strand breaks in the DNA, since TUNEL staining labels both types of DNA breaks. Lee et al. (17Lee Y. Barnes D.E. Lindhal T. McKinnon P.J. Gene Dev. 2000; 14: 2576-2580Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar) proposed that ATM could be important in preventing the accumulation of DNA damaged cells in the nervous system and suggested that this is mostly a developmental process and not one that progresses postnatally. According to this notion, DNA damage should be apparent in the brains of Atm(−/−) newborns or young animals rather than at older ages. Indeed, we observed such a phenomenon in the cerebrum where the early, higher level of DNA damage observed in 1-month-old Atm(−/−) mice was reduced at the age of 4 months. A possible explanation is that the removal of the DNA-damaged cells is delayed in Atm(−/−) mice. We failed to detect higher damage levels in the cerebellum of young Atm−/− mice, but high damage levels were noticed at 4 months of age, suggesting that in this organ the accumulation of DNA damage in these mice is a progressive process. Studies in several laboratories, including ours (33Barlow C. Dennery P.A. Shigenaga M.K. Smith M.A. Morrow J.D. Roberts L.J. Wynshaw-Boris A. Levine R.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 9915-9919Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar, 34Kamsler A. Daily D. Hochman A. Stern N. Shiloh Y. Rotman G. Barzilai A. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 1849-1854PubMed Google Scholar, 35Quick K.L. Dugan L.L. Ann. Neurol. 2001; 49: 627-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), have shown that loss of ATM resulted in a higher state of oxidative stress, especially in the cerebellum. Although the cause of this stress is not fully understood, it is possible that it is mediated by a high level of nitric oxide (NO) radicals in the cerebellum. NO reacts rapidlyin vivo with the superoxide anion to form the powerful oxidant peroxynitrite (ONOO−) (Ref. 42Radi R. Beckman J.S. Bush K.M. Freeman B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 4244-4250Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar and reviewed in Ref. 43Reiter R.J. Prog. Neurobiol. 1988; 56: 359-384Crossref Scopus (834) Google Scholar). Higher levels of superoxide anions were detected in the cerebella of Atm-deficient mice (35Quick K.L. Dugan L.L. Ann. Neurol. 2001; 49: 627-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), which in turn may lead to increased formation of peroxynitrite in the cerebellum. Increased levels of peroxynitrite may lead to increased DNA damage as well as protein damage by nitrating tyrosine groups of proteins and form the stable compound 3-nitrotyrosine. Indeed, Barlow et al. (33Barlow C. Dennery P.A. Shigenaga M.K. Smith M.A. Morrow J.D. Roberts L.J. Wynshaw-Boris A. Levine R.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 9915-9919Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar) detected increased 3-nitrotyrosine levels in extracts of brains, but not of liver, of Atm(−/−) mice, indicating NO-mediated oxidative damage of proteins. Interestingly, in brains of Alzheimer's patients, increased TUNEL labeling was associated with higher levels of 3-nitrotyrosine (36Su J.H. Deng G. Cotman C.W. Brain Res. 1997; 774: 193-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Our results suggest an association between increased TUNEL labeling in the cerebella of Atm(−/−) mice and high levels of 3-nitrotyrosine. We found that ATM loss led to a progressive and significant reduction in the cerebellar levels of NADH and NAD+, as well as to a significant reduction in NADPT and NADP+ in cerebella of 4-month-old Atm(−/−) animals. In contrast, no reduction in these pyridine nucleotides could be detected in Atm-deficient cerebra. NADPH provides the cells with reducing equivalents, while NADH serves primarily in the production of ATP. The reduction in NADT and NADPT is probably a reflection of increased cerebellar oxidative and energetic stress. Indeed, increased rates of mitochondrial respiration were measured in Atm(−/−) cerebella compared with their control littermates, thus supporting the notion that Atm(−/−) cerebella function under energetic stress. In 4-month-old cerebella, Atm loss led to the reduction in NADT levels and to increased mitochondrial respiration. Does this mean that the reduction in NADH levels should limit the increase in mitochondrial respiration? The NADH concentration in the mitochondrial matrix is in the mm range, whereas theKm of complex I to NADH as a substrate is around 1–2 μm (44Vinogradov A.D. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1993; 24: 367-375Crossref Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Thus, a 60% reduction in NADH levels should not affect the ability of the mitochondria to increase their respiration rate as a result of Atm loss. NAD+ depletion may stem from progressive accumulation of DNA damage. This phenomenon was observed mainly in the cerebellum but not in the cerebrum. It is possible that cells showing higher levels of DNA damage are those destined to be removed and therefore do not activate their DNA repair machinery, whereas the cerebellar neurons activate this machinery. Since NADPH, NADH, and NAD+ affect numerous enzymatic activities, alterations in their levels should have a significant impact on cellular homeostasis and may explain part of the pleotropic effects of ATM loss. NAD+ is an important factor in DNA repair processes. It is the substrate of PARP, which represents an early response of DNA damage. Activation of PARP as a result of DNA damage is expected to deplete the cellular NAD+ content (for review, see Ref.31Hageman G.J. Stierum R.H. Mutat. Res. 2001; 475: 45-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Accumulation of DNA damage will further induce the DNA repair machinery, which will further deplete the energetic resources of the cells. In addition to PARP, the Sir2 protein family includes enzymes with NAD+-dependent histone deacetylation and ADP-ribosylation activities, which are involved in transcriptional silencing (37Sinclair D.A. Guarente L. Cell. 1997; 91: 1033-1042Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1144) Google Scholar, 38Kaeberlein M. McVey M. Guarente L. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2570-2580Crossref PubMed Scopus (1703) Google Scholar). It has been shown that the activity of the Sir2 family of proteins is sensitive to alterations of NAD+concentrations (39Ziegler M. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 1550-1564Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). NADH is one of the most important cellular defense lines against stress conditions. The importance of NAD+ was demonstrated by a study showing an association between DNA fragmentation and parallel loss of NAD+ and energetic failure. Interestingly, feeding the mice with nicotinamide significantly increased the pool of brain NAD+. A large pool of NAD+ provided prior to an oxidative insult (intaventricular injection oft-butylhydroperoxide) could resist NAD+depletion and decrease DNA fragmentation. The restored NAD+pool also led to elevated NADH, NADP+, and NADPH, enabling the enhancement of energetic and oxidative defense-related activities (40Kalidman L.K. Mukherjee D.K. Adams Jr., J.D. Biophys. Biochim. Acta. 2001; 1525: 136-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). The finding that NADH levels are substantially lower in Atm(−/−) cerebella at 4 months of age supports our hypothesis that the cerebellum, which is most affected in A-T patients, is under constant stress. Moreover, the fact that cerebellar NADH reduction in Atm(−/−) cerebellum is progressive supports the idea that of slow accumulation of damage in these cells that may lead to the stress characteristics and neurodegeneration. The findings of higher levels of NADH as well as an increased NADH/NADT ratio in the cerebrum (Figs. 4 and5) may explain the slower rate of the degenerative processes in A-T cerebra compared with in the cerebellum. Besides covalent protein modification and serving as a substrate for several enzymes, NAD+ may also be used as a signal molecule in the cytosol or in mitochondria. For example, protein modification is catalyzed by ADP-ribosyltransferases that attach the ADP-ribose moiety of NAD+ to specific amino acid residues of the acceptor proteins. As a result, biological activities such as DNA repair, transcription, apoptosis, neoplastic transformations, etc. may be severely altered. In addition, NAD+ derivatives such as cyclic ADP-ribose can participate in cytosolic calcium regulation (for review, see Ref. 39Ziegler M. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 1550-1564Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). Thus, the reduced levels of NADH, NAD+, and NADP+ may lead to both increased oxidative stress and impaired signal transduction pathways. In summary, we have demonstrated that ATM loss leads to the accumulation of DNA breaks, the depletion of pyridine nucleotides, and increased mitochondrial respiration rate in murine neuronal tissues, particularly in the cerebellum. These findings support our notion that certain tissues in Atm(−/−) mice are under constant stress. Based on these findings we suggest that ATM loss leads to the accumulation of unrepaired DNA breaks, which in turn impose constant stress on the DNA damage response mechanisms. Overactivation of these systems depletes the cells of pyridine nucleotides, followed by constant activation of critical signaling pathways that leads to severe disturbances in cellular energetic homeostasis. Further studies should reveal the mechanisms by which ATM controls cellular homeostasis. Better understanding of the ongoing stress responses in Atm-deficient tissues could offer novel therapeutic approaches to help alleviate some of the symptoms associated with A-T, primarily the progressive neurodegeneration."
https://openalex.org/W2102453092,"In infectious and familial prion disorders, neurodegeneration is often seen without obvious deposits of the scrapie prion protein (PrPSc), the principal cause of neuronal death in prion disorders. In such cases, neurotoxicity must be mediated by alternative pathways of cell death. One such pathway is through a transmembrane form of PrP. We have investigated the relationship between intracellular accumulation of prion protein aggregates and the consequent up-regulation of transmembrane prion protein in a cell model. Here, we report that exposure of neuroblastoma cells to the prion peptide 106–126 catalyzes the aggregation of cellular prion protein to a weakly proteinase K-resistant form and induces the synthesis of transmembrane prion protein, the proposed mediator of neurotoxicity in certain prion disorders. The N terminus of newly synthesized transmembrane prion protein is cleaved spontaneously on the cytosolic face of the endoplasmic reticulum, and the truncated C-terminal fragment accumulates on the cell surface. Our results suggest that neurotoxicity in prion disorders is mediated by a complex pathway involving transmembrane prion protein and not by deposits of aggregated and proteinase K-resistant PrP alone.

This transformation is initiated by an exogenous source of PrPSc in cases acquired by infection, triggered by mutation(s) in the prion protein gene in inherited forms, and is a random, spontaneous event in sporadic cases. Following the initial conversion, subsequent transformation of additional PrPC molecules progresses autocatalytically, resulting in deposits of PrPSc in the brain parenchyma. Unlike PrPC, PrPSc aggregates easily, is insoluble in nonionic detergents, and is partially resistant to limited digestion by proteinase K. Deposits of PrPSc in the brain parenchyma are believed to be the principal cause of neuronal toxicity in prion disorders (1Prusiner S.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 13363-13383Crossref PubMed Scopus (5168) Google Scholar, 2Cohen F.E. Prusiner S.B. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 793-819Crossref PubMed Scopus (473) Google Scholar, 3Caughey B. Nat. Med. 2000; 6: 751-754Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Although PrPSc is believed to be responsible for both transmission and pathogenicity in all prion disorders, the molecular events leading to PrPSc-induced transformation of additional PrPC molecules and the consequent neuronal toxicity are poorly understood. Because neurodegenerative changes typical of prion disorders are often seen without detectable PrPSc, alternative mechanisms of neuronal death besides PrPSc deposition have been suggested (4Brown P.

One such mechanism is through the preferred synthesis of CtmPrP, a transmembrane form of PrP that spans the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane at residues 113–135 with its N terminus in the cytosol, rather than the normal glycolipid-linked PrPC that is translocated co-translationally into the ER lumen. Mice carrying the mutant PrP transgene A117V that has an increased predilection forCtmPrP synthesis show spontaneous neurodegeneration without detectable PrPSc and, when challenged with infectious prions, show neurodegeneration earlier and with smaller amounts of accumulated PrPSc than the corresponding animals with a deleted transmembrane domain. In fact, in these cases the extent of neurodegeneration correlates directly with the amount ofCtmPrP rather than PrPSc load, indicating thatCtmPrP, and not accumulated PrPSc, is responsible for the observed neurodegeneration (7Hegde R.S. Mastrianni J.A. Scott M.R. DeFea K.A. Tremblay P. Torchia M. DeArmond S.J. Prusiner S.B. Lingappa V.R. Science. 1998; 279: 827-834Crossref PubMed Scopus (617) Google Scholar, 8Hegde R.S. Trembly P.

We have examined the initial events of PrPC aggregation in a cell model, and the correlation between intracellular accumulation of aggregated PrPC and CtmPrP generation. To initiate the aggregation of endogenous PrPC, we have used an internal peptide of PrP comprising residues 106–126 (PrP106–126) instead of the proteinase K (PK)-resistant core of PrPSc that constitutes the infectious prion particle. PrP106–126 offers the advantage of being similar to PrPSc in several respects and at the same time is more soluble and easy to manipulate for cell culture studies. For example, like PrPSc, PrP106–126 is rich in β-sheet structure, forms aggregates that are detergent-insoluble and PK-resistant, and is toxic to primary cultures of neurons (9Rymer D.L. Good T.A. J. Neurochem. 2000; 75: 2536-2545Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 10Ettaiche M. Pichot R. Vincent J.-P. Chabry J. J. Biol.

Furthermore, residues 90–141 of PrP have been shown to be sufficient for initiating or blocking the transformation of PrPC, probably because these constitute the principal site of binding of PrPSc to PrPC during the conversion process (12Kaneko K. Peretz D. Pan K.-M. Blochberger T. Wille H. Gabizon R. Griffith O.H. Cohen F.E. Baldwin M.A Prusiner S.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

This region can be further narrowed down to residues 112–120, which are considered particularly important for the binding and inhibitory effect (11Brown D.R. Biochem. J. 2000; 352: 511-518Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 14Chabry J. Caughey B. Chesebro B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13203-13207Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). In this study, we demonstrate that when PrPC-expressing neuroblastoma cells are exposed to nontoxic concentrations of PrP106–126, micro-aggregates of PrP106–126“seed” the aggregation of endogenous, cellular PrPCinto thioflavin-binding deposits that accumulate in the lysosomes. Subsequently, there is increased synthesis of the potentially neurotoxic transmembrane CtmPrP in these cells. Our data provide the first direct evidence for nucleation-dependent transformation of PrPC into aggregated and weakly PK-resistant forms in a cell model. More importantly, our findings show a direct correlation between intracellular PrPC aggregation and CtmPrP up-regulation, indicating that prion-related neuropathology is mediated by complex cellular pathway(s) involvingCtmPrP and not simply by deposits of PrPSc. All cell culture supplies were obtained from Invitrogen. Hygromycin B was from Calbiochem; Hoechst and Lysotracker dye were from Molecular Probes (Eugene, Oregon). Biotin-tagged PrP106–126 and biotin-tagged scrambled PrP106–126 were custom synthesized (Genemed Corp., San Francisco). Glutaraldehyde, osmium tetroxide, uranyl acetate, lead citrate, and epoxy resin were from Polysciences Inc. (Warrington, PA). Anti-PrP monoclonal antibody 3F4 (specific to PrP residues 109–112) was from Richard Kascsak (New York State Institute for Basic Research in Developmental Disabilities). Anti-PrP monoclonal antibody 8H4, which binds to a site between residues 145–180 of PrP, was raised in our facility (20Zanusso G. Liu D. Ferrari S. Hegyi I. Yin X. Aguzzi A. Hornemann S. Liemann S.

All other chemicals, including antibodies to the glial fibrillary acidic protein (anti-GFAP) and neurofilament-specific (NF68) antibodies were purchased from Sigma. PrPC-expressing human neuroblastoma cells were generated as described previously (17Singh N. Zanusso G. Chen S.G. Fujioka H. Richardson S. Gambetti P. Petersen R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28461-28470Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) and cultured in the presence of 500 μg/ml hygromycin B. Fetal brain cells were obtained from the Birth Defects Research Laboratory (University of Washington). Discarded brain tissue from human therapeutic abortions was washed with cold Hanks' buffer containing gentamycin and dissociated by trituration through a fire-polished glass pipette. Cells were separated from large aggregates of connective tissue by a brief centrifugation at 200 × g for 5 min. The supernatant containing suspended cells was recentrifuged, and the cells were cultured on Matrigel-coated dishes in minimum essential medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 1% penicillin/streptomycin, and 0.01% gentamycin for 24 h. The culture medium was then replaced with neurobasal medium containing B27 supplements. To enrich for neuronal cells, the mitotic inhibitor cytosine arabinoside (10 μm) was added to the medium after 2 days of culture. For immunofluorescence analysis, the cells were plated on Matrigel-coated coverslips rather than in Petri dishes and subjected to the required experimental conditions. The following peptides were custom synthesized for the study: biotin-tagged PrP106–126 (PrP106–126), biotin-106KTNMKHMAGAAAAGAVVGGLG126; and biotin-tagged scrambled PrP106–126(PrPScr106–126), biotin-NGAMALMGGHGATKVKVGAAA. Biotinylation of PrP106–126 does not alter its biochemical properties (11Brown D.R. Biochem. J. 2000; 352: 511-518Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16Gu Y. Jing Y. Kumar A. Sharma Y. Fujioka H. Singh N. J. Alzh. Dis. 2001; 3: 169-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). Peptide stocks were dissolved in Me2SO and kept frozen until use. At the time of subculture, PrP106–126 or PrPScr106–126 (5 μm) was dissolved in culture medium and centrifuged at 1000 × g for 10 min to eliminate large aggregates. The supernatant was used to culture PrPC-over-expressing neuroblastoma cells or primary brain cultures. Every 3 days, the neuroblastoma cells were trypsinized and subcultured with fresh peptide solution. Brain cells were cultured in the presence of peptide for 1–4 weeks. For all immunostaining experiments, anti-PrP antibody 8H4 was used to detect cellular PrP. This antibody is specific to residues 145–180 of PrP and thus does not react with PrP106–126. The specificity of this antibody has been confirmed in several studies by independent laboratories (18Manson J.C. Jameison E. Baybutt H. Tuzi N.L. Barron R. McConnel I. Somerville R. Ironside J.

For detecting biotin-tagged PrP106–126 or biotin-tagged PrPScr106–126, streptavidin-conjugated-Texas red was used because of the specific binding of streptavidin with biotin. For immunostaining cell surface proteins, permeabilization of the membrane with Triton X-100 was omitted. Neuroblastoma cells cultured in normal medium or in 5 μm biotin-PrP106–126 or biotin-PrPScr106–126 were fixed and stained with 8H4 (1:25)-anti-mouse-fluorescein isothiocyanate (1:25) (Southern Biotechnology Associates) followed by streptavidin-conjugated-Texas red (1:40) (Pierce). For intracellular staining, fixed cells were permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 prior to immunostaining as described above. Stained cells were incubated with Hoechst 33342 (1 μg/ml) (Molecular Probes) for 5 min to detect apoptotic nuclei and mounted in Gel-mount (Biomeda Corp., Foster City, CA). All samples were observed with a laser scanning confocal microscope (Bio-Rad MRC 600). A single 5 μm optical section and a composite of several sections were evaluated in each case. For immunoelectron microscopy, cells treated with biotin-PrPScr106–126 (“control”) or biotin-PrP106–126 (“treated”) were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and 0.01% glutaraldehyde, and endogenous peroxidase activity was quenched by exposing fixed cells to 0.3% H2O2. The cells were then immunostained with 8H4 (1:20) followed by peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse (1:50) and mouse peroxidase-anti-peroxidase (1:250), exposed to 3,3′-diaminobenzidine (DAB) containing 0.1 m imidazole to obtain an electron-dense reaction product and fixed again with 2.5% glutaraldehyde. Subsequently, the cells were post-fixed in 1% osmium tetroxide, dehydrated, embedded in Epon 812, and processed for electron microscopy. Post-staining with uranyl acetate and lead citrate was omitted to enhance the contrast for the PrP-specific DAB stain. For intracellular immunostaining, fixed cells were permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 before processing as described above. For ultrastructural analysis, cells were processed by conventional methods and examined with a Zeiss electron microscope (Zeiss CEM 902; Carl Zeiss Inc., Thornwood, NY). Cells treated with biotin-PrPScr106–126 (control) or biotin-PrP106–126 (treated) were processed for Western blotting as described (17Singh N. Zanusso G. Chen S.G. Fujioka H. Richardson S. Gambetti P.

Membranes containing transferred proteins were probed with either anti-PrP antibody 8H4 (1:1000) or 3F4 (1:40,000) followed by anti-mouse-horseradish peroxidase (1:4000) or streptavidin-conjugated horseradish peroxidase (1:40,000). Reactive bands were visualized on an autoradiographic film by ECL (Amersham Biosciences Inc.). Cells treated with biotin-PrPScr106–126 (control) or biotin-PrP106–126 (treated) were radiolabeled with 50 μCi/ml of Tran35S-label overnight in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 5% dialyzed serum or with 75 μCi/ml of [3H]ethanolamine in complete medium. Labeled cells were treated with PI-PLC (Oxford Glycosystems) in Opti-MEM for 1 h at 37 °C. Cell lysates and PI-PLC-released proteins in the medium were subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-PrP antibody 3F4 or 8H4 as described (17Singh N. Zanusso G. Chen S.G. Fujioka H. Richardson S.

Anti-PrP antibody 3F4 binds to residues 109 and 112 of PrP and therefore detects truncatedCtmPrP and the conventional PK-resistant 20-kDa fragment of PrP. Anti-PrP antibodies 8H4 and 2301 bind to both the 18- and 20-kDa fragments of PrP (Fig. 8). Cells treated with biotin-PrPScr106–126(control) or biotin-PrP106−126 (treated) were lysed in a buffer containing nonionic detergents Nonidet P-40 (1%) and deoxycholate (0.5%). Large aggregates and nuclei were pelleted by low speed centrifugation at 500 × g, and the low speed supernatant was further ultracentrifuged at 100,000 ×g in a Beckman SW50 rotor for 1 h at 4 °C. The low and high speed pellet and supernatant samples were analyzed by Western blotting. Duplicate sets of samples were electroblotted and probed with 8H4, 3F4, or streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase as described above. Only the low speed supernatant fraction is shown here because all of the aggregated PrPC and PrP106–126 were found in the low speed pellet and supernatant fractions rather than in the high speed pellet as observed for conventional aggregated PrP. For evaluation of proteinase K resistance, lysates of control (biotin-PrPScr106–126) or treated (PrP106–126) cells were exposed to 3 μg/ml PK for 0, 2, or 4 min at 37 °C. The reaction was stopped with 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and proteins were electroblotted and probed with 3F4 as described (17Singh N. Zanusso G. Chen S.G. Fujioka H. Richardson S.

Cells treated with biotin-PrPScr106–126 (control) or PrP106–126(treated) were washed and homogenized on ice in a buffer containing 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 1.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm KCl, and 0.5 mm dithiothreitol by 20 strokes of a Kontes all-glass Dounce homogenizer. The homogenate was checked microscopically for cell breakage and centrifuged to pellet nuclei. The resulting supernatant was centrifuged at 20,000 × g to pellet membrane vesicles. The pelleted vesicles were resuspended in 0.5 ml of transport buffer (25 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 115 mm KOAc, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm KCl, 2.5 mm CaCl2, and 1 mm dithiothreitol) and treated with 20 μg/ml proteinase K on ice for 30 min. After the addition of 5 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride to stop the reaction, membrane vesicles were pelleted again, solubilized in lysis buffer, and immunoblotted with 3F4. Cells treated with biotin-PrPScr106–126 (control) or biotin-PrP106–126 (treated) for 1 year were fixed and permeabilized as described above and immunostained with 8H4 (1:25 dilution)-anti-mouse-rhodamine isothiocyanate (1:40 dilution). Subsequently, the cells were incubated with a 1% aqueous solution of thioflavin S for 20 min and washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline followed by one quick wash with 70% ethanol. Cells stained only with thioflavin S were prestained with the basic dye hematoxylin to reduce the background binding to nucleic acids, and processed as above. In a previous report, we showed that exposure of neuroblastoma cells to nontoxic concentrations of PrP106–126 leads to intracellular accumulation of aggregated peptide, whereas scrambled PrP106–126 is degraded rapidly (16Gu Y. Jing Y. Kumar A. Sharma Y. Fujioka H. Singh N. J. Alzh. Dis. 2001; 3: 169-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). To study the effect of long-term exposure of cells to PrP106–126, neuroblastoma cells expressing high levels of transfected PrPC were cultured for 4–12 months in complete medium containing 5 μmPrP106–126 or PrPScr106–126 biotinylated at the N terminus. The cells were subcultured every 3 days, and the peptide was replenished. Cell viability was checked every day for the first month by staining with the nuclear dye Hoechst, and the rate of cell division was monitored by counting the number of cells every 3 days before subculturing. At this low concentration, the peptide dissolves easily in culture medium at pH 7.4 and is not toxic to neuroblastoma cells even after prolonged periods of constant exposure. Interaction of PrP106–126 and the corresponding scrambled peptide with PrPC-expressing cells was studied by immunofluorescence analysis. Monoclonal antibody 8H4 was used to detect cellular PrPC and Texas red-conjugated streptavidin to visualize biotin-tagged PrP106–126 or the corresponding scrambled peptide. Because the epitope for 8H4 lies between residues 145–180 of PrP, it does not bind to PrP106–126, and it provides a convenient method of differentiation between PrPC and PrP106–126. After 4 months of exposure to biotin-PrP106–126, cells were fixed with paraformaldehyde and immunostained for PrPC(green) or PrP106–126 (red; Fig.1). To visualize immunostained surface proteins, permeabilization with detergent was omitted. A composite confocal image was taken to detect staining at different depths, including invaginations of the plasma membrane. Small to large aggregates of PrP106–126 are evident at the cell surface (red), most of which co-localize with PrPC(yellow; Fig. 1A, panels 1 and 2). Some aggregates appear to be undergoing endocytosis (*, Fig. 1A, panels 1 and 2), whereas others are larger and more diffuse (Fig. 1A, panel 2). Control cells cultured with biotin-PrPScr106–126 show no staining for the peptide but a uniform surface staining for PrPC with 8H4 and 3F4 antibodies (Fig. 1A, panels 3 and 4). Nontransfected M17 cells show no reactivity with 8H4 (Fig. 1A, panel 5).Figure 1PrP106–126 induces the aggregation and internalization of cell surface PrPC.A, surface immunofluorescence analysis of cells treated with biotin-PrP106–126 for 4 months with 8H4-fluorescein isothiocyanate to identify PrPC (green) followed by Texas red-streptavidin to detect biotin-PrP106–126(red) shows co-localization of PrPC and PrP106–126 aggregates on the plasma membrane (panels 1 and 2). Large aggregates of irregular shape that co-stain for PrPC and PrP106–126 (panel 2) and smaller aggregates that appear to be undergoing endocytosis are evident (panels 1 and 2, insets). Immunostaining of control cells treated with biotin-PrPScr106–126 for a similar period of time with 3F4 or 8H4 shows a normal pattern of PrP immunoreactivity on the cell surface and in the Golgi area (panels 3 and 4). Nontransfected M17 cells treated with biotin-PrP106–126and immunostained with 8H4 show no PrP immunoreactivity (panel 5). Bar, panels 1 and 2, 25 μm;insets, 10 μm. Immunoelectron microscopy of the above cells using 8H4 shows a uniform, punctate staining of PrPCon the surface of control cells treated with biotin-PrPScr106–126 (panel 6). In contrast, cells treated with biotin-PrP106–126 show aggregates of PrPC on the cell surface (panels 7 and8) that are gradually internalized in membrane-enclosed vesicles (panels 9–11). In some cells, the aggregates assume large proportions (panels 9–11), enough to distort the nucleus (panel 10).

Cells treated with PrP106–126 show engorgement with PrPC(green), PrP106–126 (red), and combined (yellow) aggregates (panels 2 and3). A similar analysis with 3F4 shows normal PrP staining pattern in control cells (green, panel 4), whereas PrP106–126-treated cells show intracellular aggregates of PrPC (green) or PrP106–126(red). (Because 3F4 cross-reacts with PrP106–126, the yellow aggregates may represent only PrP106–126 mixed aggregates as in panels 2and 3; immunoelectron microscopy of Triton-permeabilized cells shows similar results. A uniform, punctate reaction of PrPC can be detected on the plasma membrane of cells treated with biotin-PrPScr106–126 (panel 7). In contrast, biotin-PrP106–126-treated cells show large intracellular aggregates of PrPC (panel 8). Nontransfected M17 cells treated with PrP106–126 show no PrP reactivity (panel 9).

Cells treated with biotin-PrPScr106–126 or biotin- PrP106–126 were fixed and stained with 8H4 without prior permeabilization as described above. The bound antibody was reacted with the appropriate secondary antibody and DAB to obtain an electron-dense deposit as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Subsequent staining with uranyl acetate and lead citrate was omitted to obtain a better contrast with DAB staining. Cells cultured in the presence of scrambled peptide show a uniformly distributed, punctate staining of PrPC on the cell surface (PM: Fig. 1A, panel 6), whereas PrP106–126-treated cells show localized aggregation of PrPC at the plasma membrane Fig. 1A, panels 7 and 8). The aggregates increase in size gradually and are internalized in large, membrane-bound vesicles (Fig. 1A, panels 9–11). In some cases the aggregates are so large as to distort the nuclear membrane (Fig. 1A, panel 10). The intracellular localization of aggregated PrP106–126and PrPC was assessed by immunofluorescence analysis of Triton X-100-permeabilized cells. Cells treated with scrambled peptide or PrP106–126 for 4 months were immunostained with 8H4 and Texas red-conjugated streptavidin as described above. Composite confocal images were taken to visualize the aggregates at different depths in the cell. Control cells treated with scrambled peptide show the expected intracellular immunoreactivity of PrPC in the Golgi area (Fig. 1B, panel 1), whereas PrP106–126-treated cells show aggregates of PrP106–126 (red) and PrPC(green) or complex aggregates containing PrPCand PrP106–126 (yellow) at the cell surface and in intracellular vesicles (Fig. 1B, panels 2 and3). Immunostaining with an alternate anti-PrP antibody 3F4 shows similar results. Scrambled peptide-treated cells show normal PrP immunoreactivity (Fig. 1B, panel 4), whereas PrP106–126-treated cells show large intracellular aggregates with immunoreactivity for PrPC(green) (Fig. 1B, panels 5 and 6). (Because 3F4 also binds to PrP106–126 (at residues 109 and 112), the aggregates with a yellow staining pattern could be combined aggregates of PrP106–126-PrPC or the aggregated peptide alone.)

https://openalex.org/W2022741391,"Hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL) is an intracellular lipase that plays an important role in the hydrolysis of triacylglycerol in adipose tissue. HSL has been shown to interact with adipocyte lipid-binding protein (ALBP), a member of the family of intracellular lipid-binding proteins that bind fatty acids and other hydrophobic ligands. The current studies have addressed the functional significance of the association and mapped the site of interaction between HSL and ALBP. Incubation of homogeneous ALBP with purified, recombinant HSL in vitro resulted in a 2-fold increase in substrate hydrolysis. Moreover, the ability of oleate to inhibit HSL hydrolytic activity was attenuated by co-incubation with ALBP. Co-transfection of Chinese hamster ovary cells with HSL and ALBP resulted in greater hydrolytic activity than transfection of cells with HSL and vector alone. Deletional mutations of HSL localized the region of HSL that interacts with ALBP to amino acids 192–200, and site-directed mutagenesis of individual amino acids in this region identified His-194 and Glu-199 as critical for mediating the interaction of HSL with ALBP. Interestingly, HSL mutants H194L and E199A, each of which retained normal basal hydrolytic activity, failed to display an increase in hydrolytic activity when co-transfected with wild type ALBP. Therefore, ALBP increases the hydrolytic activity of HSL through its ability to bind and sequester fatty acids and via specific protein-protein interaction. Thus, HSL and ALBP constitute a functionally important lipolytic complex. Hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL) is an intracellular lipase that plays an important role in the hydrolysis of triacylglycerol in adipose tissue. HSL has been shown to interact with adipocyte lipid-binding protein (ALBP), a member of the family of intracellular lipid-binding proteins that bind fatty acids and other hydrophobic ligands. The current studies have addressed the functional significance of the association and mapped the site of interaction between HSL and ALBP. Incubation of homogeneous ALBP with purified, recombinant HSL in vitro resulted in a 2-fold increase in substrate hydrolysis. Moreover, the ability of oleate to inhibit HSL hydrolytic activity was attenuated by co-incubation with ALBP. Co-transfection of Chinese hamster ovary cells with HSL and ALBP resulted in greater hydrolytic activity than transfection of cells with HSL and vector alone. Deletional mutations of HSL localized the region of HSL that interacts with ALBP to amino acids 192–200, and site-directed mutagenesis of individual amino acids in this region identified His-194 and Glu-199 as critical for mediating the interaction of HSL with ALBP. Interestingly, HSL mutants H194L and E199A, each of which retained normal basal hydrolytic activity, failed to display an increase in hydrolytic activity when co-transfected with wild type ALBP. Therefore, ALBP increases the hydrolytic activity of HSL through its ability to bind and sequester fatty acids and via specific protein-protein interaction. Thus, HSL and ALBP constitute a functionally important lipolytic complex. hormone-sensitive lipase adipocyte lipid-binding protein glutathione S-transferase Chinese hamster ovary Hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL)1 is an intracellular neutral lipase that is highly expressed in adipose and steroidogenic tissues (1Kraemer F.B.

The enzyme has broad substrate specificity, displaying hydrolytic activity against triacylglycerol, diacylglycerol, and cholesteryl ester (2Fredrikson G. Stralfors P. Nilsson N.O. Belfrage P. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 6311-6320Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Observations from HSL-null mice have shown that HSL is responsible for ∼50% of the neutral triglyceride lipase activity and all of the neutral cholesteryl ester hydrolase activity in white adipose tissue (3Osuga J.-I.

The sequence of HSL is unrelated to other mammalian lipases, but it shares sequence and structural similarity with several bacterial and fungal lipases (4Hemilä H. Koivula T.T. Palva I. Biochim.

This structural similarity is based on the ability to model a large portion of the C-terminal ∼450 amino acids of HSL as an α/β hydrolase (7Contreras J.A. Karlsson M. Østerlund T. Laurell H. Svensson A. Holm C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31426-31430Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar); however, the initial ∼320 amino acids of the protein share no sequence or structural homology with any known proteins. Within the C-terminal region of the protein lies a 150-amino acid sequence that contains a number of sites phosphorylated in response to lipolytic stimulation (7Contreras J.A. Karlsson M.

Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 8973-8979Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). In this regard HSL is unique among lipases for the ability of its activity to be up-regulated by phosphorylation. In addition to phosphorylation, HSL activity appears to be regulated by oligomerization, with the dimeric enzyme exhibiting markedly increased activity (14Shen W.-J. Patel S. Kraemer F.B. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 2392-2398Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Utilizing a yeast two-hybrid screen of a rat adipose tissue library, we previously demonstrated that HSL specifically interacts with adipocyte lipid-binding protein (ALBP or aP2) and identified the N-terminal 300 amino acids of HSL as the region responsible for this interaction (15Shen W.-J. Sridhar K. Bernlohr D.A. Kraemer F.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 5528-5532Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). ALBP is highly expressed in adipose tissue and is a member of the family of intracellular fatty acid-binding proteins that bind fatty acids, retinoids and other hydrophobic ligands (16Bernlohr D.A. Simpson M.A. Vogel Hertzel A. Banaszak L.J. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 1997; 17: 277-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). It has been proposed that intracellular fatty acid-binding proteins function to sequester fatty acids, thus serving as an intracellular buffer or participating in facilitating the movement of fatty acids within the cell. In view of our observation that HSL and ALBP interact, we proposed that ALBP might prevent feedback inhibition of HSL by high local concentrations of free fatty acids released at the site of hydrolysis. Consistent with this view, adipocytes from ALBP-null mice exhibit markedly reduced basal and stimulated lipolysis both in situ and in vivo (17Coe N.R. Simpson M.A. Bernlohr D.A. J.

In the present studies we have addressed the functional significance of the interaction of HSL with ALBP and provide evidence that the interaction of ALBP with HSL constitutes an additional mechanism whereby the hydrolytic activity of HSL is regulated. Furthermore, we have explored the identification of the sequences in HSL that mediate its interaction with ALBP. All chemicals were from Sigma unless otherwise indicated.

Patel S. Kraemer F.B. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 2392-2398Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Recombinant His-HSL was generated by cloning full-length rat HSL cDNA into the SmaI site of pAcHLT-A containing a His6 tag. pAcHLT-A-HSL (5 μg) was co-transfected into Sf21 cells with 0.5 μg of BaculoGoldTM DNA using the transfection kit from the manufacturer. The titer of the recombinant virus was determined using an end point dilution assay, and the virus was re-amplified to a final titer of 1.5 × 107 pfu/ml. To produce recombinant proteins, Sf21 cells were grown in 150-mm Petri dishes and each 2 × 107 cells were infected with 100 μl of the high titer recombinant virus; cells were harvested 3 days after infection. To metabolically label HSL, Sf21 cells were grown in complete TNM-FH insect medium supplemented withl-[2,3,4,5-3H]arginine (100 μCi) andl-[4,5-3H]leucine (100 μCi) for 3 days following infection with baculovirus. After harvesting and cell extraction, His-HSL was purified on a Ni-agarose column. Recombinant ALBP and ALBP mutants were produced in Escherichia coli and purified as described (19Xu Z.H. Buelt M.K.

After sequence confirmation of the identity of HSL mutants, the HSL mutants werein vitro translated with [35S]methionine by using the TNT® transcription/translation system (15Shen W.-J. Sridhar K. Bernlohr D.A. Kraemer F.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 5528-5532Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). GST-ALBP or GST alone were incubated with glutathione-agarose beads in buffer B (20 mm Tris, pH 8.0/0.15 m NaCl/1 mm EDTA/0.5% Nonidet P-40). After 1 h of incubation at room temperature, the beads were washed three times in buffer B and then incubated with [35S]methionine-labeled HSL. After 1 h of incubation at room temperature, the beads were washed five times in buffer B, and proteins that bound to the beads were eluted in SDS/PAGE sample buffer, separated on SDS/10% PAGE, and visualized on a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA). CHO cells were grown in Coon's F12/Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum at 37 °C under 5% CO2. For transient transfection experiments, cells were subcultured at a density of 2 × 105 cells/well in 6-well plates the day prior to incubation with 0.75 μg of pcDNA3-HSL or pcDNA3-HSL mutants, as well as 0.75 μg of pGFP-ALBP and 0.25 μg of pCMV β-galactopyranoside in 10 μl of Lipofectin reagent. Cells were transfected following the procedure from Invitrogen and harvested 40 h after transfection for measurement of HSL activity. HSL activity was determined as neutral cholesterol ester hydrolase activity using either a cholesteryl[14C]oleate emulsion for measurement of cellular activity, as described previously (13Shen W.-J. Patel S. Natu V. Kraemer F.B. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 8973-8979Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), or cholesteryl[14C]oleate dispersed in ethanol for measurement of recombinant enzyme activity. Aliquots of 1–5 μg of recombinant GST-HSL were added to 140-μl solutions of 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.0), 100 μl of 20 mmTris-HCl, 1 mm EDTA and 8% sucrose containing different concentrations of bovine serum albumin or ALBP, and 1.96 nmol of cholesteryl [14C]oleate dispersed in ethanol. After incubation at 37 °C for 1 h, the reaction was terminated by adding 3.25 ml of methanol/chloroform/heptane (1.41:1.25/1.0, v/v/v), followed by 1.05 ml of 50 mm sodium carbonate:50 mm sodium borate. The reaction mixtures were then vortexed and centrifuged for 30 min at 1500 × g. A 0.5-ml fraction of the upper phase was then removed for liquid scintillation counting. The enzyme activities were determined as picomoles of hydrolyzed cholesteryl oleate per minute per μg of enzyme. 3H-labeled His-HSL was incubated in the presence of ALBP or GST and then layered on top of a linear 10–40% (w/w) sucrose gradient (5 ml, prepared in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, and 1 mm EDTA) as described previously (14Shen W.-J. Patel S. Kraemer F.B. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 2392-2398Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The tubes were centrifuged in a SW 50.1 rotor at 50,000 rpm for 4 h. Samples were collected from the bottom of the tube in 20–22 fractions, and aliquots taken for liquid scintillation counting and determination of sucrose concentration by refractometry. Since we had previously demonstrated that HSL and ALBP physically interact (15Shen W.-J. Sridhar K. Bernlohr D.A. Kraemer F.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 5528-5532Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar), we sought to determine whether this physical interaction might influence the hydrolytic activity of HSL. As an initial approach, we assayed the effects of increasing concentrations of recombinant ALBP on the ability of baculovirus-produced rat HSL to hydrolyze cholesteryl ester substrate dispersed in ethanol. As shown in Fig.1A, addition of ALBP caused a dose-dependent increase in cholesteryl ester hydrolytic activity of HSL, which resulted in up to a 2-fold increase in activity at saturating concentrations of ALBP. To explore whether this effect of ALBP on HSL hydrolytic activity was specific for ALBP and whether it depended on the ability of ALBP to bind fatty acids, we compared the effects on HSL activity of a nonspecific protein, GST, and a mutant form of ALBP (R126L, Y128F), which possesses only 1% of the fatty acid binding capacity of the wild type protein (20Sha R.S. Kane C.D. Xu Z. Banaszak L.J. Bernlohr D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 7885-7892Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), but binds normally to HSL in GST pull down experiments (data not shown). Based upon the ALBP crystal structure (21Xu Z. Bernlohr D.A. Banaszak L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 7874-7884Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the side chains of R126L and Y128F extend into the fatty acid binding cavity. As such, they are not anticipated to participate in protein-protein interactions involving ALBP and HSL. In preliminary experiments we observed that the addition of proteins to the reaction resulted in some nonspecific or surface effects on the interaction of the enzyme with its substrate and caused an increase in activity above that seen in the absence of any other proteins. However, we found that inclusion of insulin, a completely nonspecific protein with regard to fatty acid binding or interaction with HSL (Fig. 1B), in the incubation dampened these nonspecific or surface effects. Thus, insulin (0.2 μm) was included in all subsequent assays. As shown in Fig. 1C, the addition of GST caused only a small increase in HSL hydrolytic activity above control. Addition of equimolar amounts of the fatty acid binding mutant of ALBP to the reaction increased HSL activity ∼2-fold above that seen with GST alone to the level observed with wild type ALBP. These results suggest that under the current conditions the increase in HSL activity seen in the presence of ALBP might be due primarily to its ability to interact with HSL and that the ability of ALBP to bind fatty acid does not seem to be required for this effect. As an independent means of confirming that ALBP can modulate HSL activity, we transiently co-transfected CHO cells with HSL and either vector alone or ALBP and then assayed the cellular extracts for HSL hydrolytic activity. As shown in Fig. 1D, overexpression of ALBP together with HSL led to an approximate 2-fold increase in HSL hydrolytic activity compared with cells transfected with HSL and vector alone. These data demonstrate that the presence of ALBP can lead to higher hydrolytic activity of HSL against its substrate both in vitro and within cells. We have shown that HSL exists as functional dimers composed of homologous subunits and that dimeric HSL displays dramatically greater activity against cholesteryl ester substrate when compared with monomeric HSL (14Shen W.-J. Patel S. Kraemer F.B. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 2392-2398Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Therefore, to test whether the increase in HSL activity observed in the presence of ALBP was due to a change in the dimerization of HSL, we examined the effects of ALBP on HSL subunit structure. To perform these experiments recombinant His-HSL was metabolically labeled by incubating Sf21 cells, which had been infected with HSL-containing baculovirus, with [3H]arginine and [3H]leucine. Purified3H-labeled His-HSL was incubated in the presence of ALBP or GST, and the HSL species were then fractionated by sucrose density gradient centrifugation. As shown in a representative experiment in Fig. 2, two different-sized populations of HSL were observed, consonant with a monomer and dimer; however, no consistent increase in HSL dimerization was seen in the presence of ALBP. Thus, the ALBP-induced increase in HSL activity does not appear to be due to any changes in the dimerization of HSL. We had originally proposed that the interaction of ALBP with HSL might protect HSL hydrolytic activity from product inhibition by fatty acids released during lipolysis. To examine this directly we assayed residual neutral cholesteryl ester hydrolase activity of purified, recombinant rat HSL to which increasing concentrations of oleate were added in the presence or absence of ALBP. As reported previously (22Jepson C.A. Yeaman S.J. FEBS Lett. 1992; 310: 197-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), addition of oleate resulted in a dose-dependent inhibition of HSL activity (Fig. 3A). The presence of ALBP in the incubation in the absence of any oleate increased HSL activity ∼50% (Fig. 3B). Furthermore, ALBP attenuated the oleate-induced inhibition of HSL hydrolytic activity, shifting the inhibition to the right. To control for potential nonspecific or surface effects of added proteins on the interaction of HSL with its substrate, we compared the ability of GST, the fatty acid binding mutant of ALBP (mALBP), and native ALBP to prevent oleate-induced inhibition of HSL activity (Fig. 3C). Although some nonspecific effects were observed, ALBP was significantly more effective in preventing inhibition of HSL activity at concentrations up to 25 μm oleate. Since the fatty acid binding mutant did not preserve HSL activity as effectively as native ALBP when exposed to higher concentrations of oleate (15–25 μm), these data suggest that ALBP protects HSL from product inhibition and that this protective effect is dependent, at least partially, on the ability of ALBP to bind fatty acid. Having documented that ALBP can modulate HSL hydrolytic activity, we sought to identify the structural determinants within HSL that mediate its interaction with ALBP. Previous studies had initially localized the interaction of ALBP with the 300 N-terminal amino acids of HSL (15Shen W.-J. Sridhar K. Bernlohr D.A. Kraemer F.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 5528-5532Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). To further define the region of HSL responsible for interacting with ALBP, a series of C-terminal deletions from the N-terminal 300 amino acids of HSL were generated and tested for the ability of the [35S]methionine-labeled in vitro translated products to bind to ALBP. As shown in Fig.4, [35S]methionine-labeled truncations of HSL and GST alone or ALBP-GST were incubated with glutathione-agarose beads, and the proteins that bound to the beads were washed, eluted, and separated on SDS-PAGE. The truncations to HSL-(1–240), HSL-(1–230), HSL-(1–220), and HSL-(1–209) continued to be able to interact specifically with ALBP-GST, while no interaction was observed with GST alone. However, the truncation to HSL-(1–197) showed similar binding to GST alone and ALBP-GST, while HSL-(1–187) failed to bind either GST alone or ALBP-GST. To confirm that the initial 187 amino acids are not involved in interacting with ALBP, a form of HSL was generated that lacked the initial 187 amino acids, HSL-(187–767). This truncated HSL interacted specifically with ALBP-GST, while no interaction was observed with GST alone. From these data it appears that the amino acids between 187 and 209 are responsible for the interaction of HSL with ALBP. Analyzing the predicted secondary structure of HSL using the Predict Protein PHD prediction program and the GCG prediction program suggested that amino acids 192–200 have the highest probability of being located at the surface of the protein and that they might form a loose or turn structure between two β-sheets. Internal deletion of amino acids 191–199 eliminated the binding of HSL to ALBP but also resulted in a protein without hydrolytic activity (data not shown). Likewise, deletion of amino acids 191–196 or 194–199 also resulted in HSL proteins that failed to bind to ALBP and lacked hydrolytic activity (data not shown). Therefore, we generated a series of single and double mutants of HSL between amino acids 193–199. As shown in Fig.5, [35S]methionine-labeled mutations of HSL were incubated with GST alone or ALBP-GST and then with glutathione-agarose beads, and the proteins that bound to the beads were washed, eluted, and separated on SDS-PAGE. Mutants E193A, Y195A, Y195D, Y195F, K196V/R197L, and R197A all continued to be able to interact specifically with ALBP-GST, while no interaction was observed with GST alone. In contrast, mutants H194L and E199A failed to bind either GST alone or ALBP-GST, suggesting that these sites are either directly involved in the interaction of HSL with ALBP or that mutation at either site is sufficient to alter the secondary structure of HSL in order to eliminate its binding to ALBP. To assess the functional significance of these mutations, we transiently co-transfected CHO cells with the HSL mutants and an empty vector and then assayed the cellular extracts for HSL hydrolytic activity. As shown in Fig. 6, when co-transfected with vector alone, HSL mutants E193A, H194L, Y195F, R197A, and E199A retained similar hydrolytic activity against cholesteryl ester as wild type HSL; however, HSL mutants Y195A, Y195D, and K196V/R197L resulted in reduced, though measurable, basal hydrolytic activity. Since these mutants retained hydrolytic activity, but mutations at 194 and 199 failed to bind to ALBP, we could now examine whether the specific interaction of ALBP with HSL is required for the ALBP-induced increase in HSL activity. CHO cells were transfected with the mutant HSLs and ALBP, and then assayed for neutral cholesterol esterase activity. Co-transfection of ALBP with wild type HSL increased hydrolytic activity ∼50%. Likewise, co-expression of ALBP with E193A also increased hydrolytic activity ∼50%. Co-expression of ALBP with Y195A, Y195D, or K196V/R197L appeared to increase hydrolytic activity ∼50%; however, because the basal activities of these mutants were reduced, the results should be interpreted cautiously. Interestingly, HSL mutants H194L, Y195F, or E199A, each of which retained normal basal activity, failed to display an increase in hydrolytic activity when co-expressed with ALBP. Free fatty acids are an essential source of energy for many tissues. The flux of free fatty acids is primarily dependent on the lipolysis of stored triacylglycerol in adipose tissue (23Gordon Jr., R.S. Cherkes A. J. Clin. Invest. 1956; 35: 206-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Multiple mechanisms are involved in controlling lipolysis; however, HSL appears to play a critical role, mediating the initial hydrolysis of triacylglycerol to diacylglycerol, followed by the hydrolysis of diacylglycerol to monoacylglycerol (2Fredrikson G. Stralfors P. Nilsson N.O. Belfrage P. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 6311-6320Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The final step, hydrolysis of monoacylglycerol to glycerol and fatty acid, is mediated by another enzyme, monoacylglycerol lipase (24Fredrikson G. Tornqvist H. Belfrage P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1986; 876: 288-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). One of the mechanisms regulating lipolysis is control of the intracellular localization of HSL, with lipolytic stimulation leading to the translocation of HSL from the cytosol to the lipid droplet in some physiological settings (25Egan J.J.

In addition, the hydrolytic activity of the enzyme is increased following phosphorylation by protein kinase A (12Anthonsen M.W. Rönnstrandt L. Wernstedt C. Degerman E. Holm C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 215-221Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar, 13Shen W.-J. Patel S. Natu V. Kraemer F.B.

A. 1970; 67: 290-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Our previous observation that HSL specifically interacts with ALBP led us to propose that ALBP might prevent feedback inhibition of HSL caused by high local concentrations of fatty acids released at the site of hydrolysis (15Shen W.-J. Sridhar K. Bernlohr D.A. Kraemer F.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 5528-5532Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). An alternate concept would be that ALBP delivers fatty acids to HSL, thereby mediating the inhibition of catalytic activity by lipids. In the present studies we have provided evidence that the interaction of ALBP with HSL constitutes an additional mechanism whereby the hydrolytic activity of HSL is regulated. Thus, incubation of ALBP with purified, recombinant HSL in vitro resulted in an increase in substrate hydrolysis. This ALBP-induced increase in hydrolytic activity was due to at least two components: first, a small nonspecific effect of added protein, perhaps to alter the surface tension of the substrate and thus its interfacial interaction with the enzyme, and second, a specific effect. The specific effect of the ALBP-induced increase in HSL hydrolytic activity appeared to be due primarily to the ability of ALBP to interact with HSL. The ability of ALBP to bind fatty acid did not seem to be required for this effect, since a fatty acid binding mutant of ALBP, which binds normally to HSL, displayed a similar capacity to increase activity as wild type ALBP. There was no evidence that the ALBP-induced increase in HSL activity was due to any changes in the dimerization of HSL. Furthermore, the ability of ALBP to increase HSL hydrolytic activity was also demonstrated in situ by observing an increase in HSL activity in cells co-transfected with HSL and ALBP as compared with HSL and vector alone. Importantly, the ability of fatty acids to inhibit HSL hydrolytic activity was attenuated by co-incubation with ALBP. This protection of HSL hydrolytic activity was also due both to a nonspecific component and to a specific component. In this case, the specific effect of ALBP to protect HSL from fatty acid induced inhibition appeared to depend in part on the ability of ALBP both to interact with HSL and to bind fatty acids since the ALBP fatty acid binding mutant did not preserve HSL activity as effectively as native ALBP when exposed to higher concentrations of fatty acids. It should be noted that the level of ALBP in vivo is extremely high (estimated to be 250–400 μm), suggesting that, within the cellular context, the ability of ALBP to relieve product inhibition by sequestration of fatty acids is likely to be much greater than measured in vitro or in situ. Indeed, based upon the amount of fatty acids released from isolated adipocytes and the estimated water volume of an adipocyte, the calculated intracellular concentration of fatty acids is estimated to be ∼600 ± 75 μm (29Bernlohr D.A. Jenkins A. Hertzel A.V. Frohnert B.I. Coe N.R. Witthuhn B. Smith A.J. Johnson J. Matarese V.A. Ntambi J. Adipocyte Biology and Hormone Signaling. IOS Press, Amsterdam, Netherlands2000: 31-39Google Scholar). The near 1:1 stoichiometry of the total fatty acid pool with ALBP and the high affinity of fatty acids for the protein, measured by a combination of titration calorimetry and fluorescence displacement assays, suggest that the fatty acids within the cell are largely, if not exclusively, found protein-bound. Thus, the concentration dependence measured for HSL appears to be well within the physiological range. By analysis of a series of deletional mutants of HSL in GST pull-down experiments, we were able to localize the region of HSL that interacts with ALBP to amino acids 192–200. While it is still possible that regions >209 could affect binding through some secondary interactions, normal binding of HSL and ALBP was detected when >209 was eliminated, but not detected when >187 was eliminated, supporting the localization of the primary binding determinants within amino acids 187–209. Site-directed mutagenesis of individual amino acids in this region showed that mutation of either His-194 or Glu-199 eliminated the ability of HSL to interact with ALBP. Thus, these two residues, either directly or indirectly, are critical for mediating the interaction of HSL with ALBP. Interestingly, HSL mutants H194L and E199A, each of which retained normal basal hydrolytic activity but were unable to bind to ALBP, failed to display an increase in hydrolytic activity when co-transfected with wild type ALBP. The fact that these mutants retained normal basal hydrolytic activity argues against mutations at these sites affecting HSL dimerization, since monomeric HSL displays only ∼1/40 the activity of the dimer (14Shen W.-J. Patel S. Kraemer F.B. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 2392-2398Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Moreover, this is consistent with our finding that no apparent increase in HSL dimerization occurred with incubation with ALBP. Consequently, it appears that the capacity of ALBP to increase the hydrolytic activity of HSL is not due solely to the ability of ALBP to bind and sequester fatty acids, but appears to be dependent on the physical interaction of ALBP with HSL. This finding would suggest that the binding of ALBP to HSL might either alter the conformation of the enzyme allowing substrate to access the catalytic site more efficiently or prevent fatty acids from inhibiting the enzyme through a conformational change or steric inhibition. It is apparent, however, that the binding of ALBP to HSL may not be sufficient to allow an increase in hydrolytic activity since HSL mutants Y195F and R197A retained the ability to bind to ALBP and retained basal hydrolytic activity, yet failed to display an increase in hydrolytic activity when co-transfected with wild type ALBP. This discrepancy might be due to conformational alterations associated with the mutations that either prevent ALBP-induced conformational changes or do not allow for ALBP-induced steric effects. Therefore, it appears that ALBP can increase the hydrolytic activity of HSL through its ability to bind and sequester fatty acids and through its specific protein-protein interaction, perhaps leading to a conformational change or steric effects on HSL. Evidence that these functional effects of the interaction of ALBP with HSL occur in vivo is supported by experiments with ALBP-null mice (17Coe N.R. Simpson M.A. Bernlohr D.A. J. Lipid Res. 1999; 40: 967-972Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18Scheja L. Makowski L. Uysal K.T. Wiesbrock S.M. Shimshek D.R. Meyers D.S. Morgan M. Parker R.A. Hotamisligil G.S. Diabetes. 1999; 48: 1987-1994Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). In the absence of ALBP, intracellular free fatty acid concentrations are increased in adipose cells, and basal and isoproterenol-stimulated lipolysis are decreased ∼40% or to a similar degree suggested by ourin vitro and cell experiments. Thus, the current observations are consistent with the proposal that ALBP and HSL constitute a lipolytic complex. This complex functionally results in an increase in the hydrolytic activity of HSL brought about by the physical interaction of HSL with ALBP and by the ability of ALBP to bind and sequester fatty acids. Thereby, lipolysis and intracellular trafficking of fatty acids are controlled in an organized fashion."

Besides stimulating synovial fibroblast-like cells to proliferate, BCP crystals are a potent inducer of human matrix metalloproteinases (hMMPs), which can speed up the articular joint tissue degeneration of osteoarthritis patients. Here, we report that transfections with hMMP1 luciferase reporter plasmids in fibroblast-like synoviocytes revealed that the induction of hMMP1 promoter by BCP crystals was mainly mediated through the −72AP-1 element. Elimination of the −72AP-1 element either by mutation or deletion abolished the induction of hMMP1 promoter activity by BCP crystals almost completely. Interestingly, a mutation at the −88PEA-3 site also abolished the induction of hMMP1 promoter. Further mutation at the −181AP-1 site resumed the induction, indicating that the −181AP-1 element had an effect opposite to the −72AP-1 element. The effect of −181AP-1 could be inactivated either by a mutation at this −181AP-1 site or by the −88PEA-3 element. In addition, dominant negative Ras, Raf, and MEK1/2 could block the induction of hMMP1, and a MEK1/2-specific inhibitor (UO126) could block the induction of hMMP1 and c-Fos by BCP crystals. Taken together, these data indicate that multiple elements, including at least AP-1 and PEA-3, are involved in the induction of hMMP1 gene expression by BCP crystals and that the induction follows the Ras/MAPK/c-Fos/AP-1/MMP1 signaling pathway.

Arthritis and Allied Conditions. Williams & Wilkins, Baltimore1997: 2127-2142Google Scholar) crystals are a group of clinically heterogeneous arthritides. The incidence of both of these calcium crystals in arthritis significantly increases with age. The etiology of these diseases is currently unknown. It has been found that BCP crystals exist in the joint fluid of up to 60% of osteoarthritis (OA) patients (3Halverson P.B. McCarty D.J. Ann. Rheum. Dis. 1986; 45: 603-605Google Scholar, 4Carroll G.J. Stuart R.A. Armstrong J.A. Breidahl P.D. Lasing B.A. J. Rheumatol. 1991; 18: 861-866Google Scholar). In addition, the presence of BCP crystals correlates strongly with radiographic evidence of cartilaginous degeneration and is associated with larger joint effusions when compared with joint fluid from osteoarthritic knees where BCP crystals are absent (3Halverson P.B. McCarty D.J. Ann. Rheum. Dis. 1986; 45: 603-605Google Scholar, 4Carroll G.J. Stuart R.A. Armstrong J.A. Breidahl P.D. Lasing B.A. J. Rheumatol. 1991; 18: 861-866Google Scholar). BCP crystals include hydroxyapatite, calcium phosphate, and calcium tricalcium phosphate and are more common in degenerative joints than in normal joints or joints affected with inflammatory forms of arthritis. Conversely, OA is both more common and more severe in patients with calcium-containing crystals. The most compelling argument favoring a role for BCP crystals in OA stems from their in vitro effects on cells derived from human articular tissues. In addition to stimulating fibroblast mitogenesis (5Cheung H.S. Story M.T. McCarty D.J. Arthritis Rheum. 1984; 27: 668-674Google Scholar, 6McCarthy G.M. Mitchell P.G. Cheung H.S. Arthritis Rheum. 1991; 34: 1021-1030Google Scholar), BCP crystals increase levels of MMP1, -8, -13, and stromelysin (6McCarthy G.M. Mitchell P.G. Cheung H.S.

Connect. Tissue Res. 2000; 42: 1-12Google Scholar), which in turn may disturb the extracellular matrix deposition/degradation equilibrium. OA is characterized by progressive deterioration and erosion of joint cartilage. Numerous studies have demonstrated significant involvement of MMPs in the pathologic degradation of the cartilage matrix (9Woessner Jr., J.F. Gunja-Smith Z. J. Rheumatol. Suppl. 1991; 27: 99-101Google Scholar, 10Shlopov B.V. Lie W.R. Mainardi C.L. Cole A.A. Chubinskaya S. Hasty K.A. Arthritis Rheum. 1997; 40: 2065-2074Google Scholar, 11Malemud C.J. Goldberg V.M. Front. Biosci. 1999; 4: D762-771Google Scholar). Collagenase is a subfamily of MMP enzymes that includes fibroblast collagenase (MMP1), neutrophil collagenase (MMP8), and collagenase-3 (MMP13). These enzymes play a major role in connective tissue remodeling, including degradation of native type II collagen, the major structural protein of cartilage. Human MMP1 (hMMP1) and hMMP13 are both present at significantly elevated levels in the synovial fluid and cartilage of patients with OA. Chondrocytes obtained from cartilage adjacent to OA lesions express higher levels of hMMP1 and hMMP13 in comparison with chondrocytes from more normal appearing cartilage located in the same joint (10Shlopov B.V. Lie W.R. Mainardi C.L. Cole A.A. Chubinskaya S. Hasty K.A. Arthritis Rheum. 1997; 40: 2065-2074Google Scholar). hMMP1 gene expression has been shown to be stimulated by native type I collagen, phorbol esters, growth factors, and cytokines, such as interleukin-1β (IL-1β) and tumor necrosis factor-α (12Harris Jr., E.D. N. Eng. J. Med. 1990; 322: 1277-1289Google Scholar, 13Brinckerhoff C.E. Crit. Rev. Eukaryotic Gene Expression. 1992; 2: 145-164Google Scholar, 14Aho S. Rouda S. Kennedy S.H. Qin H. Tan E.M.L. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 247: 503-510Google Scholar). Transcriptional activation of hMMP1 by phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) is mediated primarily through the −77AP-1 and −181AP-1 elements, a PEA-3 element, and a “TTCA” motif (15Vincenti M.P. White L.A. Schroen D.J. Benbow U. Brinckerhoff C.E. Crit. Rev. Eukaryotic Gene Expression. 1996; 6: 391-411Google Scholar, 16Gutman A. Wasylyk B. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 2241-2246Google Scholar). Higher levels of induction can be seen with larger fragments of promoter, suggesting the presence of additional cis-acting elements upstream. The AP-1 site can be found in all of the three human collagenases and has been shown to be critical to the expression of human collagenases (16Gutman A. Wasylyk B. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 2241-2246Google Scholar, 17Mauviel A. J. Cell. Biochem. 1993; 53: 288-295Google Scholar, 18Pendas A.M. Balbin M. Liano E. Jimenez M.G. Lopez-Otin C. Genomics. 1997; 40: 222-233Google Scholar). We are particularly interested in the effects of BCP crystals on the expression of the hMMP1 gene. Although it has been shown that BCP crystals stimulate the gene expression of hMMP1 in cultured fibroblasts (6McCarthy G.M. Mitchell P.G. Cheung H.S. Arthritis Rheum. 1991; 34: 1021-1030Google Scholar, 7McCarthy G.M. Michell P.G. Struve J.A. Cheung H.S. J. Cell. Physiol. 1992; 153: 140-146Google Scholar), the transcription regulation and signal transduction by which BCP crystals induce the gene expression of hMMP1 have been incompletely studied. Defining the mechanism of transcriptional induction of hMMP1 gene expression by the BCP crystals and the signaling pathway involved may provide insight into the pathophysiology of OA and crystal deposition disease, and the information may be useful for therapeutic agent design. Consequently, we undertook a study to determine the transcriptional requirements for augmented hMMP1 promoter activity in response to BCP crystals and to further define the signaling pathway involved. BCP crystals were synthesized by a modification of published methods (6McCarthy G.M. Mitchell P.G. Cheung H.S. Arthritis Rheum. 1991; 34: 1021-1030Google Scholar). Crystals were crushed and sieved to yield 10–20-μm aggregates that were sterilized and rendered pyrogen-free by heating at 200 °C for at least 90 min. Crystals were weighed and suspended by sonication in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) immediately before use. Phosphocitrate (PC) was synthesized as described previously (19Cheung H.S. Sallis J.D. Sruve J.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1315: 105-111Google Scholar). Recombinant human IL-1β and epidermal growth factor (EGF) were obtained from R & D Systems (Minneapolis, MN). PMA was from Calbiochem. DMEM, Opti-MEM I medium, fetal bovine serum (FBS), and stock antibiotic/antimycotic mixture (10,000 units/ml penicillin base, 10,000 μg/ml streptomycin base, and 25 μg/ml Fungizone) were products of Invitrogen. The MEK1- and MEK1/2-specific inhibitors (PD98059 and U0126) were from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA). All other chemicals were from Sigma. Canine fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLSs) were isolated by enzymatic dispersion of canine synovial tissues. Briefly, the tissues were minced and incubated with 1 mg/ml collagenase in serum-free DMEM for 2 h at 37 °C, filtered through a nylon mesh, extensively washed, and cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS, penicillin, streptomycin, and l-glutamine in a humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere. After overnight culture, nonadherent cells were removed, and adherent cells were cultivated in DMEM containing 10% FBS. FLSs used were third to twelfth passage cells. The PathDetect cis-reporting plasmids pAP1luci, pSREluci, pNF-κBluci, and pCREluci, which contain the luciferase reporter gene driven by the basic promoter element TATA box plus tandem repeats of the consensus binding sequence for the corresponding transcription factor, were obtained from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA). The PathDetect trans-reporting systems, each of which contains a pFR-luci reporter plasmid and a unique fusion trans-activator plasmid, were obtained from the same company. These trans-reporting systems are designed for the study of the in vivo effects of new gene products, growth factors and drug candidates on the activation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), and p38 MAPK. Each PathDetect trans-reporting system includes a unique fusion trans-activator plasmid that expresses a fusion protein. The fusion protein is a trans-acting, pathway-specific transcriptional activator. The fusion activator protein consists of the activation domain of either the c-Jun, Elk1, or CHOP transcriptional activator fused with the yeast GAL4 DNA binding domain. When a fusion trans-activator plasmid and the pFR-luci reporter plasmid are cotransfected into mammalian cells and the transfected cells are subsequently treated with external cellular stimuli, phosphorylation of the transcription activation domain of the fusion trans-activation protein by JNK, MAPK, or p38 MAPK activated by the external cellular stimuli will induce transcription of the luciferase gene from the reporter plasmid pFR-luci. Expression levels of luciferase reflect the in vivo activation of these kinases and the corresponding signal transduction pathways. The plasmid pCMV-RafS621A, which expresses a dominant negative form of the Raf protein when transfected into mammalian cells, was from CLONTECH(Palo Alto, CA). The plasmids pREP4-K97AMEK1 and pREP4-K101AMEK2, which express a dominant negative form of the MAPK kinase 1 (MEK1) or MAPK kinase-2 (MEK2) protein, were obtained from Dr. Jeffrey T. Holt (20Abbott D.W. Holt J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2732-2742Google Scholar). The pCMV-RhoN19, pCMV-RacN17, and pCMV-RasN17 expression plasmids express the dominant negative form of RhoA, Rac1, and Ras proteins when transfected into mammalian cells (21Coso O.A. Cjiariello M. Yu J.C. Teramoto H. Crespo P. Xu N. Miki T. Gutkind J.S. Cell. 1995; 81: 1137-1146Google Scholar). The hMMP1 promoter/luciferase reporter plasmids, −4372hMMP1luci, −3400hMMP1luci, −2900hMMP1 luci, −1600hMMP1luci, −512hMMP1luci, and −315hMMPluci, used in this study contain the firefly luciferase gene under the transcriptional control of the hMMP1 promoter and have been described previously (22Rutter J.L. Benbow U. Coon C. Brinckerhoff C.E. J. Cell. Biochem. 1997; 66: 1-15Google Scholar). Additional deletion constructs were prepared by a PCR method using specific oligonucleotide primers andHindIII-linearized −512hMMP1luci as template. Forward primers extending downstream from nucleotides −192, −104, −83, and −61 (−192CCGCTCGAGCTTGTTTGAAGTTAATCGTGACACC,−104CCGCTCGAGTATTCATAGCTAATCAAGTTTATGTTATAAAGC,−83CCGCTCGAGGTTATAAAGCATGAGTCAGACACCTCTGGC,−61CCGCTCGAGCCTCTGGCTTTCTGGAAGGGC) as well as a reverse primer extending upstream from nucleotide +68 (+68CCCAAGCTTGGCCTTTGTCTTCTTTCTC) were used to generate PCR products. The resulting PCR products were enzyme-digested with XhoI and HindIII and subsequently subcloned into the XhoI/HindIII sites of the pGL3-luci reporter vector (Promega, Madison, WI). The XhoI andHindIII enzyme digestion sequences within the PCR primers are underlined. The DNA sequence of all deletion constructs was verified by direct DNA sequencing. 5′ deletion mutants of the −72AP-1 sequence, −88PEA-3 sequence, and the −181AP-1 sequence were prepared using the corresponding deletion constructs −83luci, −104luci, and −192luci as templates for PCR-based site-directed substitution mutagenesis. The forward primers used were as follows:−83CCGCTCGAGGTTATAAAGCATGATTTAGACACCTCTGGC (the −72AP-1 sequence was changed from TGAGTCAG (wild type) to TGATTTAG);−104CCGCTCGAGTATTCATAGCTAATCAAGATTATGTTATAAAGC (the −88PEA-3 sequence was changed from GAGGATG (wild type) to GATTATG);−192CCGCTCGAGATCTTGTTTGAAGTTAATAATGACATTGCAACACC (the −181AP-1 sequence was changed from TTAATCA (wild type) to TTAATAA). The same reverse primer extending upstream from nucleotide +68 (+68CCCAAGCTTGGCCTTTGTCTTCTTTCTC) was used. The resulting PCR products were enzyme-digested with XhoI andHindIII and subsequently subcloned into theXhoI/HindIII sites of the pGL3-luci reporter vector (Promega, Madison, WI). The XhoI andHindIII enzyme digestion sites within the PCR primers are underlined, and the mutation sites are in boldface type. Each mutation was confirmed by direct DNA sequencing. Additionally, constructs having a single mutation or double mutations in each of the three sites −72AP-1, −88PEA-3, and −181AP-1 were generated using the −192luci plasmid as a template with the GeneEditor in vitrosite-directed mutagenesis system from Promega. Mutations were confirmed by direct DNA sequencing. The resulting plasmids were named as follows: −192luci (wild type), −192M181AP1luci (mutation at the −181AP-1 site), −192M88PEA3luci (mutation at the −88PEA-3 site), −192M72AP1luci (mutation at the −72AP-1 site), −192M181AP1–88PEA3luci (mutation at both the −181AP-1 and −88PEA-3 sites), and −192M181AP1 −72AP1luci (mutation at both the −181AP-1 and −72AP-1 sites). FLSs were grown in DMEM containing 10% FBS. Transfections were performed using the LipofectAMINE reagent (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, exponentially growing FLSs were plated at a density of 7.5 × 105 cells/well in six-well cluster plates (Costar, Cambridge, MA) in 2 ml of DMEM, 10% FBS and grown until 80–90% confluent (24–36 h). The cells were then washed, placed in fresh Opti-MEM I, and cotransfected with 1.2 μg of hMMP1luci and 0.4 μg of β-galactosidase control plasmids using 5 μl of LipofectAMINE reagent/well. After 18 h, the cells were gently washed with DMEM and subsequently incubated with fresh DMEM containing BCP crystals (50 μg/ml). The cells were harvested 24 h later using reporter lysis buffer (Promega, Madison, WI). The luciferase activity was determined on an EG&G Berthold Autolumat LB953 Rack Luminometer and reported as relative light units. The β-galactosidase activity was determined using the β-galactosidase assay kits from Promega and following the manufacturer's instructions. Three to six independent transfections, each run in triplicate, were performed, and the results were normalized to the β-galactosidase activity. Data were expressed as means ± S.E., and the relative promoter activity of hMMP1 in the presence of BCP crystals was calculated based on the level of promoter activity of hMMP1 without BCP crystal treatment. FLSs were placed in 100-mm plates at 7.5 × 106 cells/plate and grown until 90% confluent (24–36 h). The cells were then washed with phosphate-buffered saline and subsequently incubated in DMEM containing 0.5% heat-inactivated FBS for 24 h. At the onset of the experiments, media were replaced by serum-free DMEM, by serum-free DMEM containing MEK1-specific inhibitor PD98059 (100 μm), or by serum-free DMEM containing PC (1 mm) and preincubated for 15 min. The cells were then treated with BCP crystals (50 μg/ml) for 30 min. The total cellular RNA was harvested using RNAzol reagent (Tel-Test, Inc., Friendswood, TX) and quantified by optical density. Total RNA samples (15 μg/lane) were subjected to Northern blot analysis. Briefly, after electrophoresis in MOPS electrophoresis buffer, the RNA was transferred in 10× SSC buffer by capillary action using a sponge. The RNA was fixed to the nylon membrane by UV light exposure with a Stratagene UV linker (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The membrane was then prehybridized 2–4 h in 5× SSPE, 5× Denhardt's reagent, 0.5% SDS, 100 μg/ml denatured salmon sperm carrier DNA (Invitrogen), and 50% formamide. The filter was hybridized with random-primed 32P-labeled c-fos probe (Invitrogen). After overnight hybridization at 42 °C in 6× SSPE, 0.5% SDS 100 μg/ml denatured salmon sperm carrier DNA, and 50% formamide, the membrane was washed twice in 1× SSC with 0.1% SDS at room temperature and then washed twice at 55 °C using 0.1× SSC and 0.1% SDS. The filter was autoradiographed with Kodak X-Omat AR film for 24–72 h at −70 °C. The c-fos probe was a 1.3-kilobase PstI v-fos fragment from the pfos-1/plasmid supplied by I. Verma (Salk Institute, San Diego, CA). We have previously shown that BCP crystals induce significant accumulation of human MMP1 mRNA in human foreskin fibroblasts (6McCarthy G.M. Mitchell P.G. Cheung H.S. Arthritis Rheum. 1991; 34: 1021-1030Google Scholar, 7McCarthy G.M. Michell P.G. Struve J.A. Cheung H.S. J. Cell. Physiol. 1992; 153: 140-146Google Scholar, 19Cheung H.S. Sallis J.D. Sruve J.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1315: 105-111Google Scholar). Here, we show that the promoter activity of hMMP1 was induced in a dose-dependent manner by BCP crystals in FLSs (Fig. 1). This induction could be blocked by PC, a specific inhibitor of the biological effects of BCP and calcium pyrophosphate dihydrate crystals, indicating that the induction of hMMP1 promoter activity was BCP crystal-specific (19Cheung H.S. Sallis J.D. Sruve J.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1315: 105-111Google Scholar). The inductions of hMMP1 promoter by IL-1β and PMA are also shown in Fig. 1 for comparison. The modest changes in luciferase activity seen in BCP crystal-treated cells, when compared with those seen by Northern blot (19Cheung H.S. Sallis J.D. Sruve J.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1315: 105-111Google Scholar, 23Cheung H.S. Devine T.R. Hubbard W. Osteoarthritis Cartilage. 1997; 5: 145-151Google Scholar), may be either due to the high sensitivity of the Northern method or to the limited supply of transactivators in the BCP crystal-treated cell. Those transactivators, although activated by BCP crystal treatment, may be insufficient to stimulate the multiple copies of the exogenous hMMP1 promoter/luciferase reporter introduced into the cells by transfection. The strong signal seen in Northern blot might also be explained by MMP-1 mRNA stabilization. The activation of the c-fos gene, whose product is one of the components of the AP-1 transcription factor, is controlled primarily by an SRE and a CRE site within the c-fos promoter (24Misra R.P. Rivera V.M. Wang J.M. Fan P.D. Greenberg M.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 4545-4554Google Scholar, 25Nair D. Misra R.P. Sallis J.D. Cheung H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18920-18925Google Scholar). Recently, we have shown that BCP crystals enhance the binding of proteins to oligonucleotides that contain AP-1 or NF-κB consensus sequences (26McCarthy G.M. Augustine J.A. Baldwin A.S. Christopherson P.A. Cheung H.S. Westfall P.R. Scheinman R.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 35161-35169Google Scholar). To determine whether SRF, CREB, AP-1, or NF-κB are directly involved in the induction of the promoter activity of hMMP1, FLSs were transiently transfected with the pSREluci, pAP1luci, pNF-κBluci, and pCREluci reporter plasmids separately, together with a β-galactosidase control plasmid. The cells were subsequently treated with BCP crystals and assayed for luciferase and β-galactosidase activities. Surprisingly, BCP crystal treatment strongly induced only the reporter activity of the pAP1luci reporter gene as shown in Fig.2. The reporter activity of pSREluci was induced slightly by BCP crystals. These results indicated that only the transcription factors AP-1 and SRF, and not the NF-κB and CREB, might be involved in the induction of hMMP1 promoter by BCP crystals, although NF-κB has been shown to be activated by BCP crystal treatment (26McCarthy G.M. Augustine J.A. Baldwin A.S. Christopherson P.A. Cheung H.S. Westfall P.R. Scheinman R.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 35161-35169Google Scholar). Monomeric GTP-binding proteins such as Ras, Rac1, and RhoA have overlapping yet distinct roles in the various MAPK-signaling pathways. To examine the potential role of various G proteins in BCP crystal signaling, we tested the capacity of the dominant negative proteins RasN17, Rac1N17, and RhoAN19 to inhibit the induction of the hMMP1 promoter by BCP crystals. These dominant negative mutants are thought to act by competitively inhibiting the interaction of endogenous GTP-binding proteins with their respective guanine nucleotide exchange factors (27Feig L.A. Cooper G.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 3235-3243Google Scholar). For these studies, FLSs were cotransfected with the −4372hMMP1luci plus one of the following four plasmids: pCMV-RasN17, pCMV-RacN17, pCMV-RhoN19, or the empty vector pCMV. The transfected cells were subsequently treated with BCP crystals. As shown in Fig.3A, cotransfection of the dominant negative form of RasN17 completely abrogated the induction of hMMP1 promoter by BCP crystals. In contrast, the expression of the dominant negative RhoAN19 proteins had no effect on the induction of hMMP1 promoter activity by BCP crystals. The dominant negative Rac1 protein could partially block the induction of hMMP1 promoter activity by BCP crystals. Taken together, these results indicated that BCP crystals induced the hMMP1 promoter activity primarily via a Ras-dependent pathway. Next, we cotransfected FLSs with the −4327hMMP1luci plasmid together with the plasmid pCMV-RafS621A or with the empty vector pCMV and subsequently treated the transfected cells with BCP crystals. Results showed that the BCP crystal-mediated induction of the promoter activity of MMP1 was completely abrogated by the dominant negative protein RafS621A (Fig. 3B). The induction of the promoter activity of MMP1 by EGF and the effect of the dominant negative protein RafS621A on the induction were also shown in Fig. 3B for comparison. The downstream factors along the Ras/Raf signaling pathway are MEK1 and MEK2. Recently, we have found that BCP crystals activated the phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK1/2) in human foreskin fibroblast (25Nair D. Misra R.P. Sallis J.D. Cheung H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18920-18925Google Scholar). To further define the signaling pathway, we co-transfected FLSs with the pFR-luc reporter plasmid together with the fusion trans-activator plasmids, pFA2-Jun, pFA2-Elk1, pFA-CHOP, or the negative control plasmid pFC-dbd separately and subsequently treated the transfected cells with BCP crystals. As shown in Fig. 4A, BCP crystals only activated the MAPK pathway and neither the p38 MAPK nor the JNK pathways. BCP crystals treatment decreased the reporter activity of the pFR-luci ∼30% compared with the untreated control when FLSs were cotransfected with the pFR-luci plus either pFA2-cJun, pFA-CHOP, or the negative control pFC2-dbd plasmids (Fig. 4A, bar groups 1–3). In contrast, BCP crystal treatment increased the reporter activity of the pFR-luci ∼30% compared with the untreated control when FLSs were cotransfected with the pFR-luci plus the pFA2-Elk1 plasmid (Fig. 4A, bar group 4). The induction of the reporter activity of pFR-luci by BCP crystals when FLSs were cotransfected with the pFA2-Elk1 plasmid was about 2-fold (Fig. 4A, bar group 5) after normalization against the reporter activity from the negative control sample (FLSs were cotransfected with the pFC-dbd plasmid). EGF was used as a positive control. It can be seen that EGF activated the MAPK and p38 MAPK pathways but not the JNK pathway (Fig. 4A), which is consistent with reports from the literature (28Harris V.K. Coticchia C.M. Kagan B.L. Ahmad S. Wellstein A. Riegel A.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 276: 10801-10811Google Scholar, 29Ellerbroek S.M. Halbleib J.M. Benavidez M. Warmka J.K. Wattenberg E.V. Stack M.S. Hudson L.G. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 1855-1861Google Scholar). We next looked at the ability of MEK1/2-specific inhibitor UO126 to inhibit the induction of the hMMP1 promoter, the c-fospromoter, and the pAP1luci reporter by BCP crystals. FLSs were separately transfected with −4372hMMP1luci, c-Fosluci, or pAP1luci and subsequently treated with BCP crystal or BCP crystal plus specific MEK1/2 inhibitor UO126 (10 μm). As shown in Fig.4B, the specific MEK1/2 inhibitor UO126 could block the induction by BCP crystals of all of the three promoter activities. Previously, we have shown that the induction of the hMMP1 message by BCP crystals was blocked by the MEK1/2-specific inhibitor UO126 at a concentration of 10 μm and the MEK1-specific inhibitor PD98059 at a concentration of 50 μm (30Brogley M.A. Cruz M. Cheung H.S. J. Cell. Physiol. 1999; 180: 215-224Google Scholar). The specific MEK1 inhibitor pD98059 inhibits the activation of MEK1 (IC50 = 5 μm) much more effectively than MEK2 (IC50 = 50 μm). The fact that the induction of the hMMP1 message by BCP crystals could only be blocked by the MEK1-specific inhibitor PD98059 at a high concentration suggests that both MEK1 and MEK2 may play a role in mediating the induction of MMP1 by BCP crystals. Our results from cotransfection assays indicated that the dominant negative MEK1 plus MEK2 proteins (Fig. 4C) could indeed inhibit the induction of MMP1 promoter activity by BCP crystals. We next examined the c-fos mRNA levels after the treatment of FLSs with BCP crystals, BCP crystals plus MEK1-specific inhibitor PD98059, or BCP crystals plus PC. Northern blot (Fig. 5) showed that BCP crystals induced the c-fos message substantially and that the induction was totally blocked by the MEK1-specific inhibitor PD98059 (lanes 1–3). The induction by BCP crystals was also totally blocked by the BCP crystal-specific inhibitor PC, as expected (lane 4). To determine the region of the hMMP1 promoter required for its induction by BCP crystals, progressive 5′ deletions of hMMP1luci plasmids were transiently cotransfected into FLSs together with a β-galactosidase control plasmid. The cells were subsequently treated with BCP crystals and assayed for luciferase and β-galactosidase activities. As shown in Fig. 6, the hMMP1 promoter activities of all deletion fragments (down to −83 bp) were induced similarly by BCP crystal treatment, resulting in ∼2–3-fold induction. In contrast, luciferase activity in FLSs transiently transfected with the −61luci reporter driven by 61 bp of the hMMP1 promoter was not altered in response to BCP crystals. These data suggested that the sequence residing between −83 and −61 bp was critical for the induction of hMMP1 promoter"

Intermolecular disulfide bonds involve Cys39 and probably Cys147 of two adjacent cofilin units. The disulfide-linked dimers and oligomers exhibit a biological activity distinct from the monomer. While monomeric cofilin decreased viscosity and light-scattering of F-actin solutions, dimers and oligomers caused an increase in viscosity and light scattering. Electron microscopy revealed that cofilin oligomers induce the formation of highly ordered actin bundles with occasionally blunt ends similar to actin-cofilin rods observed in cells under oxidative stress. Bundling activity of the disulfide-linked oligomers could be completely reversed into severing activity by dithiothreitol. Formation of cofilin oligomers occurred also in the presence of actin at pH 8, but not at pH 6.6, and was significantly enhanced in the presence of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate. Our data are consistent with the idea that cofilin exists in two forms in vivo also: as monomers exhibiting the known severing activity and as oligomers exhibiting actin bundling activity. However, stabilization of cofilin oligomers in cytoplasm is probably achieved not by disulfide bonds but by a local increase in cofilin concentration and/or binding of regulatory proteins.

All of these processes are dependent on the correct spatial and temporal organization of the actin cytoskeleton (i.e.its regulated polymerization and depolymerization). These reorganizations of the actin cytoskeleton are regulated by a variety of actin-binding proteins, which in turn are regulated by external stimuli such as Ca2+ levels, phosphoinositides, pH, or reversible phosphorylation (1Hartwig J.H. Kwiatkowski D.J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1991; 3: 87-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar, 2Sun H.-Q. Kwiatkowska K. Yin H.L. Curr. Opin.

The turnover rates of actin filaments in living cells (reviewed in Ref. 4Zigmond S.H. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 1993; 25: 309-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar) are 100–200 times faster than the rate constants determined for pure actin (5Pollard T.D. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 103: 2747-2754Crossref PubMed Scopus (578) Google Scholar). This discrepancy is mainly due to the activity of ADF/cofilins (AC),1 which are able to increase the filament turnover in vitro up to levels found in living cells (6Carlier M.F. Laurent V. Santolini J. Melki R. Didry D. Xia G.-X. Hong Y. Chua N.-H. Pantaloni D. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 1307-1322Crossref PubMed Scopus (817) Google Scholar). The essential role of AC in enhancing the turnover of actin filaments has been demonstrated in Listeria motility assays (6Carlier M.F. Laurent V. Santolini J. Melki R. Didry D. Xia G.-X. Hong Y.

Nature. 1997; 388: 78-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar). The AC are a class of small (13–19 kDa) actin-binding proteins, which are ubiquitous in eukaryotes (reviewed in Refs. 4Zigmond S.H. Cell Motil.

Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 1243-1259Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). In contrast to other actin-binding proteins, AC are able to form 1:1 complexes with both G- and F-actin (20Nishida E. Maekawa S. Sakai H. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 5307-5313Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar), exhibiting a preference for ADP-actin over ATP-actin (6Carlier M.F. Laurent V. Santolini J. Melki R. Didry D. Xia G.-X. Hong Y. Chua N.-H. Pantaloni D. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 1307-1322Crossref PubMed Scopus (817) Google Scholar). The mechanism by which AC depolymerize actin filaments was long controversial. Earlier studies suggested that depolymerization of actin filaments was the result of severing (21Maciver S.K. Zot H.G. Pollard T.D. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 1611-1620Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar, 22Hawkins M. Pope B. Maciver S.K. Weeds A.G. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 9985-9993Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar), thereby increasing the number of filament ends. This view was challenged when it was shown that AC increase the off-rate for actin subunits at the pointed end of the actin filament (6Carlier M.F. Laurent V. Santolini J. Melki R. Didry D. Xia G.-X. Hong Y. Chua N.-H. Pantaloni D. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 1307-1322Crossref PubMed Scopus (817) Google Scholar). The two mechanisms are not mutually exclusive (23Theriot J.A. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 1165-1168Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar), and recently a mutagenic study revealed that both mechanisms take place side by side and can be uncoupled (24Pope B.J. Gonsior S.M. Yeoh S. McGough A. Weeds A.G. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 298: 649-661Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). The activity of AC is regulated in various ways. Best characterized is the reversible phosphorylation of a conserved serine residue at the amino terminus (except for yeast and Dictyostelium, where no phosphorylated form of cofilin was found) (25Agnew B.J.

In vertebrates, phosphorylation leads to the inhibition of actin binding in vitro (25Agnew B.J. Minamide L.S. Bamburg J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17582-17587Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar) and to accumulation of actin filaments in vivo (28Arber S. Barbayannis F.A. Hanser H. Schneider C.

Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 1519-1532Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). Regulation of AC thus depends on members of the Rho family GTPases, which are known to regulate the formation of filopodia, lamellipoda, and stress fibers in vertebrate cells (31Hall A. Science. 1998; 279: 509-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (5168) Google Scholar). Additionally, actin binding and depolymerizing activities of AC are regulated by binding of phosphoinositides phosphatidylinositol 1,4,5-monophosphate and PIP2 to the actin binding sites of AC, a process that inhibits AC activity (32Yonezawa N. Nishida E. Iida K. Yahara I. Sakai H. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 8382-8386Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 33Yonezawa N. Homma Y. Yahara I. Sakai H. Nishida E. J. Biol.

Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 12181-12189Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Early studies proposed that depolymerization and severing of F-actin by AC is dependent on pH, with more extensive depolymerization at pH 8 than at pH ≤ 7 (22Hawkins M. Pope B. Maciver S.K. Weeds A.G. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 9985-9993Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar, 35Yonezawa N. Nishida E. Sakai H. J. Biol.

Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 9994-10004Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). The pH effect depends on the AC protein used, as concluded from more recent studies showing that severing by AC is independent of pH, whereas the critical concentration of the AC-actin complex is increased at higher pH values, an effect that leads to an increase in unpolymerized actin (6Carlier M.F.

Binding of human cofilin to actin filaments changes the filament twist by 5° per unit, resulting in a reduced crossover length (38McGough A. Pope B. Chiu W. Weeds A. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 771-781Crossref PubMed Scopus (567) Google Scholar). This structural change prevents binding of tropomyosin (39Bernstein B.W. Bamburg J.R.

Genes Cells. 1999; 4: 21-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), the actin-interacting protein 1 (Aip1) was recently shown to bind to both actin and cofilin and to enhance the filament disassembly activity of cofilin in vitro. Furthermore, Aip1 is required to restrict cofilin localization to yeast cortical patches, whereas in the absence of Aip1, cofilin is found in actin cables as well (42Rodal A.A. Tetreault J.W. Lappalainen P. Drubin D.G. Amberg D.C. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 1251-1264Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). The original aim of the present study was to identify contact sites of actin and cofilin by thiol-specific cross-linking reactions, using reagents experienced in our laboratory for cross-linking studies with myosin S1 (44Kliche W. Pfannstiel J. Tiepold M. Stoeva S. Faulstich H. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 10307-10317Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Interestingly, we found that not only the expected actin-cofilin conjugate was formed, but also dimers and oligomers of cofilin in considerable amounts. Self-association of cofilin also occurred in the absence of actin and thus indicated an intrinsic property of cofilin. Disulfide-linked oligomers and dimers were isolated and analyzed for their structure and function. The studies on the structure of the actin-cofilin complex will be presented in a forthcoming paper. Cross-linking reagents 1-ethyl-3-(3-diethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide (EDC), 5,5′-dithiobis (2-nitrobenzoic acid) (Ellman's reagent), andN,N′-p-phenylenedimaleimide were purchased from Sigma. Bis-maleimidohexane was from Pierce. Disposable, reverse-phase C18 minicolumns for peptide purification were from Millipore and used according to the manufacturer's instructions. Endoprotease GluC was purchased from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. PIP2 was purchased from Calbiochem. Actin was purified from rabbit skeletal muscle acetone powder as described (45Pardee J. Spudich J.A. Methods Enzymol. 1982; 85: 164-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (959) Google Scholar) and further purified as Ca-ATP G-actin through Sephacryl-S-300 chromatography at 4 °C in buffer G (5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 0.2 mm ATP, 0.1 mm CaCl2, 0.5 mm DTT, 0.01% NaN3). Recombinant human cofilin in plasmid vector pMW172 was expressed inEscherichia coli strain BL21 (DE3) as described for human ADF (22Hawkins M. Pope B. Maciver S.K. Weeds A.G. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 9985-9993Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). Cell extract supernatants were filtered through a 0.2-μm filter and purified in the flow-through on Q-Sepharose FF (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.) in ADF buffer (10 mmTris-HCl, pH 8, 3 mm DTT, 0.2 mm EGTA, 1 mm NaN3, 0.1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Cofilin-containing fractions were concentrated in a stirred cell with a YM 10 membrane (Amicon) and eluted from an SP Sepharose HP column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with 20 mm MOPS, pH 6.6, 0.2 mmEGTA, 5 mm DTT, and 0.01% NaN3 with a 0–0.5m sodium chloride gradient. Purified cofilin was dialyzed against ADF buffer (without phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and stored on ice for up to 4 weeks without any loss of activity. Cofilin concentration was determined spectrophotometrically at 280 nm using a calculated extinction coefficient (ε280 = 12,741) based on the method described for human ADF (22Hawkins M. Pope B. Maciver S.K. Weeds A.G. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 9985-9993Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). Cross-linking reagents RSS(CH2)nSSR were synthesized as described (44Kliche W. Pfannstiel J. Tiepold M. Stoeva S. Faulstich H. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 10307-10317Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). For thiol-specific cross-linking experiments, the proteins were passed over a Sephadex G25 column equilibrated with reaction buffer to remove excess DTT. Thiol-specific cross-linking experiments were performed in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8 (reaction buffer 1), or 10 mm HEPES, pH 6.6 (reaction buffer 2). When cross-linking was performed in the presence of actin, reactions were carried out in buffer G (without DTT) or (for experiments involving F-actin) in 5 mm HEPES, 100 mm NaCl, 2 mmMgCl2, 0.2 mm ATP, 0.1 mmCaCl2, 0.01% NaN3, pH 6.6. Thiol-specific cross-linking reagents RSS(CH2)nSSR, Ellman's reagent and GSSG were dissolved in the corresponding reaction buffer and added to the protein solutions in less than 5% of the total volume. Incubation time was usually 1 h at room temperature unless otherwise indicated. Thiol-specific cross-linking reactions with RSS(CH2)nSSR or Ellman's reagent were quenched by the addition of a 100-fold molar excess of N-ethylmaleimide. EDC/NHS cross-linking experiments were carried out according to Grabarek and Gergely (46Grabarek Z. Gergeley J. Anal. Biochem. 1990; 185: 131-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (705) Google Scholar). Reaction mixtures were analyzed by 12.5% SDS-PAGE (47Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205531) Google Scholar). Capillary flow viscosimetry was performed in a Cannon capillary viscosimeter at 25 °C, using 11 μmF-actin. After a stable plateau was reached, cofilin monomers or cross-linked cofilin dimers and oligomers in buffer F (5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 0.2 mm ATP, 0.1 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 100 mm KCl, 0.01% NaN3) were added to a final concentration of 11 μm in volumes less than 5% of the total. In control experiments, the same volume of buffer F was added. Recovery of cofilin severing activity was measured after adding a 100-fold molar excess of DTT (in buffer F). Results were expressed as specific viscosity values (η). Light scattering measurements were performed at an angle of 90° and at a wavelength of 520 nm in an Aminco Bowman SPF500 fluorescence spectrophotometer. Cofilin monomer, dimers, and oligomers in buffer F (see above) were added to 10 μm F-actin when a stable plateau had been reached, again using volumes less than 5% of the total. Recovery of cofilin severing activity was measured after adding a 100-fold molar excess of DTT (in buffer F). Results were expressed as arbitrary units. For negative staining experiments, F-actin (2 μm) was mixed with cofilin monomers, dimers, or oligomers (2–4 μm) in buffer F using pipettes with cut tips to minimize shearing. Controls were carried out using the same volume of buffer F. Glow-discharged carbon-coated grids were floated on sample drops (20 μl) placed on a strip of parafilm, incubated for 30 min, and rinsed twice with buffer F (for a total of 5 min) before staining with 1% uranyl acetate. Micrographs were taken using a Philips 400T transmission electron microscope at 80 kV. Samples for electron cryomicroscopy were prepared as follows. Actin filaments (2 μm) were incubated for 30 min with cofilin oligomers (2 μm) in buffer F. A 7-μl drop of the sample was applied to glow-discharged holey carbon grids (400 mesh) in a humidified chamber. The grids were blotted with filter paper, plunged in liquid nitrogen-cooled ethane, and stored under liquid nitrogen until use. Micrographs were taken using a Philips CM 12 transmission electron microscope at 100 kV. α-Cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid (10 mg/ml dissolved in 50% acetonitrile, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (v/v)) was used as matrix solution. Peptides from RP-HPLC were further purified and concentrated on Ziptips (Millipore) and applied via a sandwich method on stainless steel sample holders. In brief, 0.7 μl of matrix was dried on a sample spot, followed by 0.7 μl of sample and another 0.7 μl of matrix. MALDI-TOF analysis was performed in the linear, high mass, positive ion mode with time-delayed extraction using a Kratos MALDI IV instrument (Shimadzu). Mass spectra were calibrated using external standards consisting of a mixture of substance P, the fragment 1–4 of angiotensin, oxidized insulin B chain, and ubiquitin. Spectra were recorded and analyzed using the Kratos Kompact software, version 5.2.0. Cross-linking of cofilin (100 μm) was carried out in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, for 3 h on ice, with an equimolar concentration of Ellman's reagent. Cross-linked products were separated by HPLC gel filtration chromatography using a Waters 600 HPLC system equipped with a Waters 996 photodiode array. Separation was performed at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min on two TSK 3000-G SW columns (Amersham Biosciences; 7.5 × 600 mm) in series in 0.1m Tris-HCl, 0.1 m NaCl, 0.1% sodium azide, pH 7. Usually, 200 μl of the reaction mixture was injected for a single run. Runs were monitored by following the absorbance at 214 and 280 nm, and collected fractions were identified on 12.5% SDS-PAGE. Oligomer, dimer, and monomer fractions were concentrated by ultrafiltration in Minicon (Amicon) concentrators in a Biofuge A (Haeraeus) at 4000 rpm and dialyzed overnight at 4 °C against the corresponding reaction buffer. In order to label cofilin thiols not participating in the cross-link reaction as carboxynitrophenyldisulfide, reactions were carried out as described above except for a 5-fold excess of Ellman's reagent. The labeled oligomers were purified by HPLC gel filtration chromatography, dialyzed overnight at 4 °C against 0.1m ammonium bicarbonate, pH 8, and lyophilized. Labeled oligomers were dissolved at 1 mg/ml in fresh prepared 0.1 mammonium bicarbonate, pH 8, and submitted to proteolytic fragmentation for 12 h at room temperature by adding 2% (w/w) endoprotease Glu-C (Roche Molecular Biosystems). Digestion was terminated by freezing in liquid nitrogen followed by lyophilization. Peptides were dissolved in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid and purified by RP-HPLC on a Nucleosil C18 column (0.4 × 25 cm; Knauer), using an acetonitrile/trifluoroacetic acid buffer system (buffer A: 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid; buffer B: 90% acetonitrile, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (v/v)) at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. Labeled peptides were identified by their absorption at 330 nm and analyzed by mass spectroscopy and Edman degradation. A stock solution of PIP2 (2 mg/ml; Calbiochem) was prepared as suspension in H2O by extensive sonication at 37 °C in a Sonorex R100TH sonicator and stored under N2 atmosphere at −80 °C. Immediately before use, stock solutions were thawed in a water bath at 37 °C and resonicated for 15 min at 37 °C. Reaction of recombinant human cofilin with the zero-length cross-linker Ellman's reagent (5,5′-dithio-2-nitrobenzoic acid) leads to the formation of dimers, trimers, and higher oligomers of cofilin even at equimolar concentrations of cross-linker and protein (Fig.1). The frequently used cross-linking reagent EDC achieved the formation of dimers as well, but higher oligomers were almost absent (Fig. 1). In addition, the carbodiimide reaction required a high excess of reagent and a prolonged reaction time. Oligomeric cofilin was likewise formed when thiol-specific cross-linking reagents of the type RSS(CH2)nSSR (44Kliche W. Pfannstiel J. Tiepold M. Stoeva S. Faulstich H. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 10307-10317Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar) were used. Disulfide-linked oligomers were soluble as long asn was ≤ 3 or when Ellman's reagent was used, but they precipitated with reagents of n ≥ 5, or with other thiol-specific cross-linkers such asN,N′-p-phenylenedimaleimide or bis-maleimidohexane. Since there is agreement that covalence between two proteins is formed only in cases when the proteins form a complex in solution, we conclude that cofilin has the intrinsic property of self-association. Furthermore, the successful reaction with Ellman's reagent leads to a zero-length disulfide bond between the cofilin units, indicating that in cofilin dimers and oligomers two thiol groups must come as close as 2 Å. The cofilin/cofilin interaction observed in our experiments is in line with data recently obtained in a yeast two-hybrid screen, which suggest the existence of a cofilin/cofilin interaction, although mediated by actin (42Rodal A.A. Tetreault J.W. Lappalainen P. Drubin D.G. Amberg D.C. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 1251-1264Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). In the present study, we show that self-association of cofilin takes place also in the absence of actin. For the following experiments, Ellman's reagent was chosen as the oxidizing agent, since it was the most effective of the reagents tested. When cofilin concentration was varied in the range of 2–50 μm, we found that yield of dimers and oligomers decreased with decreasing cofilin concentration but that even at a concentration of 2 μm dimers and trimers were formed (Fig.2). This suggests thatKa of cofilin self-association is in the micromolar range and thus slightly above that of the G-actin-cofilin complex (24Pope B.J. Gonsior S.M. Yeoh S. McGough A. Weeds A.G. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 298: 649-661Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). When salt was added at physiological concentrations (150 mmNaCl, 2 mm MgCl2), cross-linking occurred all the same, although at a slightly lower yield (data not shown). Since the actin depolymerizing activity of cofilin is known to be dependent on pH (22Hawkins M. Pope B. Maciver S.K. Weeds A.G. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 9985-9993Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar, 35Yonezawa N. Nishida E. Sakai H. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 14410-14412Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 36Hayden S.M. Miller P.S. Brauweiler A. Bamburg J.R. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 9994-10004Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar), we further asked whether the formation of cofilin dimers and oligomers might also depend on pH. We therefore carried out cross-linking reactions with 1 eq of Ellman's reagent at pH 6.6 and 8. Since disulfide exchange reactions are faster at pH 8 than at pH 6.6 (due to the higher concentration of the reacting thiolate anion), we extended the reaction time to 24 h. We found that self-association of cofilin takes place at both pH 6.6 and 8 but that it is favored at higher pH (data not shown). Since Ellman's reagent has an oxidation potential considerably higher than most of the naturally occurring disulfides, we assayed whether GSSG might represent a possible, physiological oxidizing agent. As expected from its lower oxidation potential, we found that GSSG was less effective in cross-linking and showed almost no effect when used at equimolar concentrations. However, when GSSG was used at a 10-fold excess, cofilin dimers and trimers were formed to an extent similar to that with 1 eq of Ellman's reagent (Fig.3a). As with Ellman's reagent, GSSG-induced cofilin oligomerization was less pronounced at pH 6.6 than at pH 8 (data not shown). We further assayed whether cofilin dimers and oligomers were formed with Ellman's reagent in the presence of actin. We found that at pH 8 there was almost no difference between oligomer formation in the presence or absence of actin with Ellman's reagent, whereas at pH 6.6, self-association of cofilin was less pronounced (Fig. 3b). Similar results were obtained when GSSG was used as the cross-linking reagent (data not shown). To see whether self-association of cofilin modulated its biological activity, we separated the reaction products obtained from cofilin and Ellman's reagent by HPLC gel filtration chromatography (Fig. 4) and analyzed the peak fractions by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 4, inset). Most of the protein material was recovered as a mixture of oligomers with n ≥ 4 (peak 1), followed by small peaks of trimer (peak 2) and dimer (peak 3). Next,"

Neurol. 2000; 48: 647-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). We provide evidence that the nonsense mutation described in the patient with this novel drug-resistant form of EA-1 generates a Kv1.1 subunit with biochemical and cell biological properties distinct from wild-type Kv1.1 and from all other known EA-1 mutations. We have characterized the folding and intracellular trafficking of each of the 14 known EA-1 mutations. This was achieved by introducing each EA-1 mutation into the Kv1.1 cDNA and expressing the recombinant subunits in mammalian cell lines and cultured hippocampal neurons. We found that Kv1.1 with the EA-1 nonsense mutation exhibits a number of characteristic traits of misfolded membrane proteins and can confer this misfolded phenotype, with resultant intracellular retention, to co-assembled wild-type Kv1 α- and Kvβ-subunits. The properties of this novel EA-1 mutant Kv1.1 polypeptide in many aspects resemble those of the mutant CFTR protein (27Johnston J.A. Ward C.L. Kopito R.R. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 1883-1898Crossref PubMed Scopus (1774) Google Scholar) encoded by the predominant mutation in cystic fibrosis patients, suggesting that diverse channelopathies may be based on similar defects in protein folding and intracellular trafficking. Moreover, these studies reveal that certain forms of EA-1 share phenotypic similarities with the large number of neurodegenerative disorders arising from protein misfolding (28Kopito R.R. Ron D. Nat.

Sequencing was performed with Sequenase version 2.0 (United States Biochemical Corp., Cleveland, OH). Plasmid DNA used in all experiments was purified using the Qiagen purification kit (Chatsworth, CA). All enzymes used for molecular biology were from either Roche Molecular Biochemicals or New England Biolabs (Beverley, MA), with the exception of PfuTurbo DNA polymerase from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA), which was used for all PCRs.

Immunoreactivity to calnexin was confirmed by immunoblot and peptide competition assay. Anti-vimentin (monoclonal, clone 9) was purchased from Sigma. Anti-ubiquitin (N-19) was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Transient transfection, immunofluorescence staining, and SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting analyses of transfected COS-1 cells were performed as described (32Shi G. Nakahira K. Hammond S. Rhodes K.J.

For folding analyses, cells were incubated at 25 °C for 24 h after changing the medium or treated with 10% glycerol at 37 or 25 °C for 48 h after changing the medium (36Sato S. Ward C.L. Krouse M.E.

Neuron. 2000; 25: 385-397Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). Point mutants were generated using the Quick Change site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA), using two complementary oligonucleotides containing the desired mutation. The Kv1.1N (residues 1–389):1.4C (residues 543–654) Kv1 chimera was generated by making an (A-C) substitution at position 1414 of the Kv1.1 coding sequence and a (G-A) substitution at nucleotide 2129 of the Kv1.4 coding sequence. This substitution creates a new BamHI site that digests at nucleotide 1412 of Kv1.1 and 2127 of Kv1.4. Kv1.1(BamHI 1414) was digested with PstI/BamHI producing a Kv1.1N fragment corresponding to amino acids 1–388. Kv1.4(BamHI 2127) was digested withBamHI/EcoRI producing a Kv1.4C fragment corresponding to amino acids 543–654. A triple ligation was performed with these two fragments and pRBG4 digested withPstI/EcoRI giving rise to the Kv1.1N (residues 1–389):1.4C (residues 543–654) chimera. 0.5 mg of each protein standard (myosin, β-galactosidase, phosphorylase, bovine serum albumin, ovalbumin, and carbonic anhydrase) and 50 μl of Kv1.1 COS-1 lysate were layered on top of separate 5–50% sucrose gradients (∼2 ml) containing Tris-buffered saline, pH 8.0, 5 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm iodoacetamide, and protease inhibitor mixture. Samples were centrifuged for 4 h at 202,059 ×g at 4 °C, and 10× 200-μl fractions were manually collected from the top of the gradient. Each 200-μl fraction was added to 800 μl of lysis buffer and immunoprecipitated with 1 μg/ml affinity-purified Kv1.1C antibody for 1 h at 4 °C. Protein A-Sepharose (30 μl) was used to precipitate antibody complexes for 30 min at 4 °C. Samples were washed three times in lysis buffer, and the final pellet was resuspended in sample buffer and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblot as described above. Wild-type Kv1.1 and Kv1.1ΔC79 were subcloned into the pSFV1 vector. cRNA was generated using Cap-Scribe system and electroporated into BHK cells. After 48 h of incubation at 37 °C and 5% CO2, cells were harvested and used for toxin binding studies as intact cells or membrane fragments (38Shamotienko O. Akhtar S. Sidera C. Meunier F.A. Ink B. Weir M. Dolly J.O. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 16766-16776Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The positions of all knownKCNA1 mutations that result in EA-1 are shown schematically in Fig. 1A. Each of the missense mutations occurs in the core domain consisting of the six transmembrane segments S1–S6 and the connecting extracellular and cytoplasmic segments. The bulk of the mutations are present in cytoplasmic domains connecting transmembrane segments S2–S3 and S4–S5. R417STOP is the single nonsense mutation that generates a truncated Kv1.1 α-subunit lacking the final 79 amino acids (Kv1.1ΔC79) of the cytoplasmic C-terminal tail (13Eunson L.H. Rea R. Zuberi S.M. Youroukos S. Panayiotopoulos C.P. Liguori R. Avoni P. McWilliam R.C. Stephenson J.B. Hanna M.G. Kullmann D.M. Spauschus A. Ann. Neurol. 2000; 48: 647-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). To investigate the molecular differences between Kv1.1 channels harboring these different EA-1 mutations, and how this contributes to the phenotypic variability in patients with this disease, site-directed mutagenesis was used to generate each of these mutations in rat Kv1.1. Rat Kv1.1 shares 98% amino acid sequence identity with human Kv1.1, and every position mutated in EA-1 patients is identical between wild-type rat and human Kv1.1. Each mutant Kv1.1 subunit was expressed in COS-1 cells and analyzed for solubility in buffers containing a 0.1% (v/v) concentration of the non-ionic detergent Triton X-100, a useful indicator of the folding state of membrane proteins (39Marquardt T. Helenius A. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 117: 505-513Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). We found that wild-type Kv1.1 and each of the 13 missense mutations were soluble in 0.1% Triton X-100 (Fig. 1B), consistent with no obvious folding defects. In contrast, the Kv1.1ΔC79 truncation mutant encoded by the R417STOP mutation exhibited a prominent detergent-insoluble fraction (Fig. 1B), indicative of misfolding. Also note that the bulk of the electrophoretic microheterogeneity of wild-type Kv1.1 is lacking in Kv1.1ΔC79, presumably due to elimination of C-terminal phosphorylation sites (40Jing J. Peretz T. Singer-Lahat D. Chikvashvili D. Thornhill W.B. Lotan I. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14021-14024Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Each of the EA-1 mutants was expressed in COS-1 cells and subjected to immunofluorescence staining. Wild-type Kv1.1 expressed in transfected mammalian cells is localized to the endoplasmic reticulum (33Manganas L.N. Trimmer J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29685-29693Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar), such that immunofluorescence staining of cells expressing wild-type Kv1.1 yields a diffuse, reticular perinuclear pattern (Fig. 1C). In contrast, Kv1.1ΔC79, while also perinuclear, is present in large membranous aggregates (Fig. 1C). A detailed quantitative analysis of the number of transfected cells exhibiting this aggregated staining pattern, which was defined as the aggregation index, revealed that the majority (56 ± 6.1%) of the cells expressing Kv1.1ΔC79 had obvious intracellular aggregates as shown in Fig.1C, whereas these were present in only 6.0% (± 1.0%) of the cells expressing wild-type Kv1.1. Each of the 13 missense EA-1 mutants resembled wild-type Kv1.1 in that aggregates were observed in 6% or fewer of the expressing cells (Fig. 1B). To determine whether these differences between wild-type Kv1.1 and Kv1.1ΔC79 existed in neurons, transfected cultured primary hippocampal neurons were subjected to immunofluorescence staining. Neurons expressing Kv1.1ΔC79 formed perinuclear aggregates of the mutant protein similar to those observed in COS-1 cells (Fig. 1D, right panel), whereas cells expressing wild-type Kv1.1 did not (Fig. 1D, left panel). These results suggest that the mechanisms that mediate folding of Kv1 channels in COS-1 cells and cultured neurons are similar. These biochemical and immunohistochemical results together show that the 13 different missense mutations found in Kv1.1 from EA-1 patients resemble wild-type Kv1.1 and do not exhibit obvious characteristics of protein misfolding. In contrast, the truncated Kv1.1 generated by the R417STOP nonsense mutation found in patients with the drug-resistant form of EA-1 exhibits two hallmarks of misfolding, detergent insolubility and intracellular aggregation. To investigate further the biochemical properties of Kv1.1ΔC79 channels, transfected COS-1 cells were subjected to extraction in increasing concentrations of Triton X-100. Almost half of the total Kv1.1ΔC79 pool was insoluble in 0.1% Triton X-100 (Fig.2A). A 10-fold increase in Triton X-100 concentration did eventually solubilize the bulk of the Kv1.1ΔC79 pool, consistent with effects of increased Triton X-100 on solubility of other misfolded proteins (39Marquardt T. Helenius A. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 117: 505-513Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the Kv1.1ΔC79 polypeptide pool in COS-1 cells consisted of two populations, one form with an apparent mass of 55 kDa, and a second form of 50 kDa. These forms differed in their detergent solubility properties, such that the 50-kDa form was consistently enriched in the detergent-insoluble fraction (Fig. 2A). The Kv1.1-deduced amino acid sequence contains a single consensusN-linked glycosylation site in the extracellular segment between the S1 and S2 transmembrane regions (41Chandy K.G. Gutman G.A. North R.A. Ligand- and Voltage-gated Ion Channels. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL1995: 1-71Google Scholar). Previously, we found that Kv1.1 is N-linked glycosylated at this site (42Shi G. Trimmer J.S. J. Membr. Biol. 1999; 168: 265-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). To determine whether the two populations of Kv1.1ΔC79 seen in COS-1 cells were different in N-glycosylation, membrane extracts were treated with PNGase F, an enzyme that cleaves N-linked sugars from glycoproteins. PNGase F treatment of Kv1.1ΔC79 reveals that the higher molecular weight Kv1.1ΔC79 pool isN-glycosylated, whereas the lower molecular weight pool is resistant to PNGase F digestion and presumably unglycosylated, such that the electrophoretic mobility of the higher molecular weight pool shifts to that of the lower molecular weight pool upon PNGase F digestion (Fig. 2B). Similar results were obtained with endoglycosidase H (Fig. 2B), consistent with the high mannose oligosaccharide present on the ER-localized Kv1.1ΔC79 (Fig.2B). Kv1.1ΔC79 was insensitive to neuraminidase treatment (Fig. 2B), consistent with its ER retention. Although wild-type Kv1.1 expressed in heterologous cells exhibits substantial microheterogeneity in molecular weight on SDS gels (Fig.1B), this is not due to differential glycosylation (43Deal K.K. Lovinger D.M. Tamkun M.M. J. Neurosci. 1994; 14: 1666-1676Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and each of the components of the wild-type Kv1.1 pool is sensitive to both PNGase F and endoglycosidase H (42Shi G. Trimmer J.S. J. Membr. Biol. 1999; 168: 265-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). These results together show that Kv1.1ΔC79 is not as efficiently N-glycosylated as is wild-type Kv1.1. Moreover, the lower molecular weight unglycosylated pool of Kv1.1ΔC79 exhibits greater resistance to detergent solubilization. These results are consistent with a model whereby the C-terminal truncation of Kv1.1ΔC79 allosterically affects the folding of the S1–S2 segment and the subsequent addition of anN-linked oligosaccharide chain at this site. To define the origin of the Kv1.1ΔC79 intracellular aggregates, transfected COS-1 cells were double-labeled for the resident ER protein calnexin, and a marker of the Golgi apparatus, the lectin Lens culinaris agglutinin (44Hsu V.W. Shah N. Klausner R.D. Cell. 1992; 69: 625-635Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Calnexin staining co-localized with the perinuclear aggregates containing mutant Kv1.1ΔC79 channels (Fig.2C) whereas L. culinaris agglutinin staining did not (data not shown). These immunofluorescence results suggest that the intracellular Kv1.1ΔC79 aggregates are derived from ER. To measure further the folding state of Kv1.1ΔC79, we undertook binding studies with two neurotoxins (α-DTX and DTXK) that exhibit high affinity binding to Kv1.1. Binding sites for125I-α-DTX were detected on the cell surface of BHK cells expressing wild-type Kv1.1 (Fig. 2D). Exposure of total cellular binding sites by sonication yielded an 18-fold increase in125I-α-DTX binding in Kv1.1-expressing cells (Fig.2D), consistent with the intracellular retention of the bulk of the expressed Kv1.1 protein (33Manganas L.N. Trimmer J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29685-29693Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Negligible cell surface binding was observed in cells expressing Kv1.1ΔC79, and cell fragmentation by sonication did not lead to an appreciable increase in total toxin binding (Fig. 2D). Immunoblot analyses performed on BHK cell membranes showed that Kv1.1 and Kv1.1ΔC79 were expressed at similar levels in the transfected BHK cells, consistent with results from COS-1 cells (see Fig. 1B). Negligible125I-DTXK binding was observed to intact or sonicated cells expressing Kv1.1ΔC79 (data not shown). These results are consistent with the notion that misfolding of Kv1.1ΔC79 alters the DTX-binding site, which is contributed by residues in the external mouth of the channel pore. Unassembled and misassembled membrane protein complexes are retained in the ER and degraded by quality control mechanisms. To determine whether the distinct phenotype of Kv1.1ΔC79 relative to wild-type Kv1.1 and the other EA-1 mutants is simply due to defects in subunit assembly, membrane extracts containing Kv1.1 or Kv1.1ΔC79 channels were analyzed on nondenaturing continuous sucrose density gradients (45Spencer R.H. Sokolov Y. Li H. Takenaka B. Milici A.J. Aiyar J. Nguyen A. Park H. Jap B.K. Hall J.E. Gutman G.A. Chandy K.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2389-2395Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Extractions were performed in 1% Triton X-100 to dissociate insoluble aggregates of Kv1.1ΔC79 such that the bulk of both Kv1.1 and Kv1.1ΔC79 were now soluble (Fig. 2A). We found that the peak of wild-type Kv1.1 immunoreactivity appeared in the gradient fraction containing proteins of apparent molecular mass of 165–285 kDa, with no evidence of pools of monomeric subunits. These results are consistent with the calculated molecular mass of Kv1.1 tetramers of 225 kDa, and with previous studies showing efficient assembly of Kv1.1 expressed in mammalian cells (43Deal K.K. Lovinger D.M. Tamkun M.M. J. Neurosci. 1994; 14: 1666-1676Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The major peak of Kv1.1ΔC79 co-migrated with wild-type Kv1.1, and peaks corresponding to unassembled monomeric subunits were not detected (Fig. 2E). These data suggest that the bulk of Kv1.1ΔC79 that could be solubilized in 1% Triton X-100 was present as tetramers (the calculated molecular mass of Kv1.1ΔC79 tetramers is 191 kDa). The Kv1.1ΔC79 sample also contained higher molecular weight species, perhaps corresponding to Kv1.1ΔC79 aggregates soluble in 1% Triton X-100. These results show that both wild-type Kv1.1 and Kv1.1ΔC79 subunits are efficiently assembled, although higher molecular weight species, presumably corresponding to aggregated channel complexes, are also observed for Kv1.1ΔC79 but not wild-type Kv1.1. Previously, it has been shown that the efficiency of intracellular trafficking of a number of integral membrane proteins, including mutant CFTR, is temperature-sensitive, implying that a polypeptide folding step was affected (46Machamer C.E.

Chemical chaperones, such as the polyhydric alcohol glycerol, have also been used as folding indicators, as glycerol can stabilize protein conformation and increase both the rate of in vitro protein refolding and the kinetics of oligomeric assembly (49Shelanski M.L.

https://openalex.org/W2042885068,"One of the prominent effects of the Src kinase is to reduce cell adhesion. The small GTPase, R-Ras, affects cell adhesion by maintaining integrin activity, and the ability of R-Ras to do so can be regulated by phosphorylation of a tyrosine residue located in its effector domain by an Eph receptor kinase (Zou, J. X., Wang, B., Kalo, M. S., Zisch, A. H., Pasquale, E. B., and Ruoslahti, E. (1999) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 96, 13813–13818). Here we show that Src regulates cell adhesion through R-Ras and integrins. Reduced substrate attachment of 293T cells transfected with the cDNA for an activated form of Src (v-Src) was accompanied by phosphorylation of endogenous R-Ras. v-Src also phosphorylated R-Ras in vitro. An activated form of Src similar to one that has been found in human cancers, Src527, shared with v-Src the ability to phosphorylate R-Ras. Stronger R-Ras phosphorylation was seen in Madin-Darby canine kidney cells cells transformed with temperature-sensitive v-Src at the permissive temperature than at the non-permissive temperature, and R-Ras and Src co-immunoprecipitated at the permissive temperature. Mutation analysis showed that the Src phosphorylation site in R-Ras was tyrosine 66, the position critical to the ability of R-Ras to support integrin activity. Finally, activated R-Ras in which tyrosine 66 is mutated to phenylalanine rendered cells partially resistant to the effects of Src on cell adhesion. Regulation of cell adhesion by Src through R-Ras may be at least partially responsible for the reduced adhesion and the resulting increased invasiveness of Src-transformed cells.

Transformed cells elaborate less fibronectin matrix than their normal counterpart cells. These properties are thought to be important in facilitating the ability of malignant cells to leave their original site and invade other tissues (1Hynes R.O. Fibronectins. Springer-Verlag, New York Inc., New York1990Crossref Google Scholar, 2Ruoslahti E. Adv. Cancer Res. 1999; 76: 1-20Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cell adhesion and extracellular matrix assembly are largely controlled by integrins, a family of heterodimeric membrane proteins that mediate cell-extracellular matrix interactions (3Giancotti F.G. Ruoslahti E. Science. 1999; 285: 1028-1032Crossref PubMed Scopus (3794) Google Scholar). Cells control the ability of their integrins to bind to extracellular ligands. Thus, certain cells can convert from non-adherent to highly adherent cells through integrin activation. This happens when platelets are activated and aggregate to initiate blood clotting and when leukocytes adhere to the vascular endothelium at inflammatory sites (4Springer T.A. Cell. 1994; 76: 301-314Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6381) Google Scholar,5Schwartz M.A. Schaller M.D. Ginsberg M.H. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev.

Cell Dev. Biol. 1995; 11: 549-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (1466) Google Scholar). Src and the oncogenic Ras proteins are among the oncoproteins that reduce cell adhesion and fibronectin matrix formation (1Hynes R.O. Fibronectins.

Cell. 1996; 85: 61-69Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar). The ability of R-Ras to control integrin activity can be regulated by phosphorylation. An Eph receptor, EphB2, phosphorylates a tyrosine residue in the effector domain of R-Ras and, as the phosphorylated R-Ras no longer supports integrin activity, cell-extracellular matrix adhesion is lost upon activation of EphB2 (11Zou J.X. Wang B. Kalo M.S. Zisch A.H. Pasquale E.B. Ruoslahti E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 13813-13818Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Another Eph receptor, EphA2, has also been reported to down-regulate integrin-mediated adhesion (12Miao H. Burnett E. Kinch M. Simon E. Wang B. Nature Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 62-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar). Based on the sequence of the kinase domain, the substrate specificity of the Eph receptor kinases is predicted to be similar to that of non-receptor tyrosine kinases such as Src (13Kalo M.S. Pasquale E.B. Cell Tissue Res. 1999; 298: 1-9Crossref Scopus (61) Google Scholar); and Src is associated with integrin complexes in focal adhesions (14Fincham V.J. Brunton V.G. Frame M.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 6518-6536Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 15Schaller M.D. Hildebrand J.D. Parsons J.T. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 3489-3505Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). In this paper, we examine the possibility that Src might also regulate integrin activity by phosphorylating the effector domain tyrosine in R-Ras. We show that v-Src and an activated mutant Src protein both phosphorylate the critical tyrosine residue in R-Ras in vitro and in cells and that Src can be co-immunoprecipitated with R-Ras from cell extracts. A variant R-Ras that cannot be phosphorylated in the effector domain renders cells partially resistant to the cell adhesion-reducing effects of activated Src. These results indicate that the R-Ras pathway is, at least in part, responsible for the reduced adhesiveness of Src-transformed cells. This may be a contributory mechanism in tumor invasion. The ts-Src MDCK cell line expressing a temperature-sensitive mutant of v-Src was provided by Dr. Steven Frisch at this institute. The kinase-inactive v-Src plasmid, pcDNA3-v-srcK295R, was generated by mutating a lysine at position 295 to an arginine in the v-Src expression plasmid, pcDNA3-v-src, by using a QuikChange Site-Directed Mutagenesis Kit (Stratagene). Construction of Myc-tagged forms of wild-type R-Ras and the mutants R-RasY66F and R-Ras66YE, and the plasmids for the expression of GST-R-Ras and GST-H-Ras have also been described (11Zou J.X. Wang B. Kalo M.S. Zisch A.H. Pasquale E.B. Ruoslahti E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 13813-13818Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). The plasmid for the expression of constitutively activated chicken c-Src, pCS2+-c-src-Y527F (16Rupp R.A.W. Snider L. Weintraub H. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1311-1323Crossref PubMed Scopus (565) Google Scholar, 17Turner D.L. Weintraub H. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1434-1447Crossref PubMed Scopus (951) Google Scholar) was a gift from Dr. Christine Holt. A monoclonal anti-Myc antibody and a polyclonal anti-R-Ras antibody used for immunoblotting were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. A polyclonal anti-Myc antibody used for immunoprecipitation was from Upstate Biotechnology, and an anti-v-Src antibody (clone 327) used for immunoblotting was from Oncogene Research Products. An anti-v-Src antibody (clone GD11) used for immunoprecipitation was obtained from Upstate Biotechnology. An anti-R-Ras antiserum was prepared by immunizing a rabbit with bacterially produced GST-R-Ras protein. Specific antibodies were purified from the antiserum on a GST-R-Ras affinity column. The antibody was then absorbed on a GST-H-Ras affinity column to eliminate any possible cross-reactivity with H-Ras. The antibody immunoblotted a single protein band of the appropriate size in 293 cells transfected with R-Ras, but not in cells transfected with H-Ras, Rap-1, or Ral. Transient transfections were performed with 293T cells. Cells were transfected in 10-cm plates at 60% confluency with 5–10 μg of each plasmid DNA by using Superfect Transfection Reagent (Qiagen). The total amount of transfected DNA was kept constant by addition of pcDNA3. To examine cell morphology, the transfected cells were marked by co-transfection with 1 μg of the enhanced green fluorescent protein vector pEGFP (CLONTECH). Cell extracts were prepared in lysis buffer (50 mm Hepes, pH 7.6, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 2 mmEDTA, 2 mm EGTA, 150 mm NaCl, 50 mmNaF, 20 mm sodium vanadate, and 10% glycerol (v/v)). Protease inhibitor phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and the protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma) were added to the lysis buffer prior to the use. For immunoprecipitation, cell lysates were first incubated with antibodies at 4 °C for 1.5 h and then incubated with GammaBind-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.) or Protein A-Sepharose beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for another 1.5 h at 4 °C. Immunoprecipitates were boiled in SDS-containing sample buffer, separated by SDS-PAGE, and transferred to Immobilon membranes (Millipore). An anti-phosphotyrosine antibody conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (PY-20H; Transduction Laboratories) was used for immunoblotting at 1:2000 dilution. An anti-Myc antibody (9E10) and anti-R-Ras antibody, both from Santa Cruz Biotechnology were used at a dilution 1:1000, followed by a secondary goat-anti-mouse IgG antibody conjugated to horseradish peroxidase. An anti-v-Src antibody (Oncogene) was used at 10 μg/ml, followed by protein A conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (Sigma). Immunoblots were developed by enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.). v-Src immunoprecipitates were split into equal amounts and washed with a kinase buffer consisting of 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.6, 20 mm MnCl2, 20 mm MgCl2, 0.25 mmNa3VO4, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, and 2.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Kinase reactions were carried out for 15 min at room temperature in kinase buffer containing 1 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP. The kinase reaction was stopped by adding SDS sample buffer. Microtiter 96-well plates (Linbro/Titertek) were pre-coated with 2.5 μg/ml fibronectin (Chemicon), 20 μg/ml type I collagen (Collaborative Biomedical Products) overnight at 4 °C. The wells were then blocked with 1% bovine serum albumin. Forty-eight hours after transfection, cultured cells were detached with 2.5 mm EDTA, washed with serum-free medium, and added to the coated wells (1 × 105 cells/well). Following incubation at 37 °C for 1 h, the wells were washed with serum-free medium, and attached cells were fixed and stained with 0.5% crystal violet in methanol-H2O. The crystal violet incorporated into cells was collected in 1% SDS and quantified by measuringA at 590 nm. The ability of v-Src to phosphorylate R-Ras was studied in 293T cells transfected with v-Src. Green fluorescent protein (EGFP) vector was co-transfected to identify the cells that had received the vector. The transfected cells showed morphological changes typical of Src transformation, rounding of the cells and growth into higher saturation density (not shown). A kinase-inactive v-Src and the vector alone caused no changes. Immunoprecipitation of R-Ras from these cells showed that R-Ras was phosphorylated in the cells transfected with v-Src, but not in cells transfected with kinase-inactive v-Src, v-SrcK295R (Fig.1). Incubation of a full-length R-Ras GST fusion protein with v-Src immunoprecipitates from v-Src-transfected 293T cells also resulted in phosphorylation of R-Ras, showing that v-Src can also phosphorylate R-Ras in vitro (Fig.2).Figure 2Phosphorylation of R-Ras by v-Src in vitro. Extracts of cells transfected with v-Src were immunoprecipitated with anti-v-Src antibody (GD11, 4 μg/ml). Equal amounts of v-Src immunoprecipitates were incubated with purified GST or GST-R-Ras in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP. Phosphorylation of R-Ras was analyzed by SDS/PAGE followed by autoradiography. Both intact GST-R-Ras and a fragment containing the GST moiety and the amino-terminal portion of R-Ras were phosphorylated.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We next examined the ability of c-Src527, an activated mutant c-Src, to phosphorylate R-Ras. We found that R-Ras immunoprecipitated from cells transfected with this variant c-Src was tyrosine-phosphorylated to an extent similar to R-Ras from v-Src cells (not shown). MDCK cells transformed with temperature-sensitive (ts) v-Src were used to further analyze the dependence of R-Ras phosphorylation on Src activity. R-Ras was more heavily phosphorylated when these cells were grown at the permissive temperature than at the non-permissive temperature, indicating a correlation between the phosphorylation of R-Ras and Src activity (Fig. 3). The R-Ras phosphorylation paralleled the temperature-sensitive morphological changes of these cells (not shown). R-Ras immunoprecipitates from the ts-v-Src-transformed MDCK cells contained v-Src when the cells had been grown at the permissive temperature (Fig. 4). No v-Src was detected in association with R-Ras in MDCK cells cultured at the non-permissive temperature. Thus, the binding of v-Src to R-Ras in cells is specific and depends on the kinase activity, or phosphorylation status, of v-Src. Alternatively, the conformation of v-Src at the non-permissive temperature may not be comparable with binding to R-Ras. The Eph receptor, EphB2, can phosphorylate R-Ras primarily in tyrosine 66 (Tyr-66), which is located in the effector domain of R-Ras (11Zou J.X. Wang B. Kalo M.S. Zisch A.H. Pasquale E.B. Ruoslahti E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 13813-13818Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). We used variant R-Ras proteins mutated at Tyr-66 to study the site of Src phosphorylation in R-Ras. The results showed that only R-Ras containing Tyr-66 was phosphorylated in cells co-transfected with c-Src527 or v-Src and one of the R-Ras variants (Fig. 5,A and B). Immunoblotting showed that the variants were equally expressed in the transfected cells. Src interacted with R-Ras regardless of whether the residue at position 66 could be phosphorylated (Fig. 6). These results indicate that Tyr-66 is the main, perhaps sole, Src phosphorylation site in R-Ras. However, the Src-R-Ras binding is not dependent on phosphorylation at this site.Figure 6Phosphorylation of R-Ras is not required for its association with v-Src. v-Src was co-transfected into 293T cells with empty vector or with Myc-tagged R-Ras, either wild-type, or mutated at residue 66 as shown. Equal amounts of cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-v-Src monoclonal antibody (GD11), and the immunoprecipitates were probed by immunoblotting. YF, Y66F mutant. YE, Y66E mutant. V, empty vector.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We have shown earlier that the R-RasY66F mutant is active in supporting integrin activity (11Zou J.X. Wang B. Kalo M.S. Zisch A.H. Pasquale E.B. Ruoslahti E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 13813-13818Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). We reasoned that, if phosphorylation of R-Ras by Src contributes to the decreased cell adhesion of Src-transformed cells, R-RasY66F should counteract this effect of Src, because its activity cannot be suppressed by phosphorylation at Tyr-66. We used the activated form R-Ras38V to prepare this mutant because the activated R-Ras more efficiently increases the adhesion of poorly adherent cells than wild-type R-Ras (10Zhang Z. Vuori K. Wang H. Reed J.C. Ruoslahti E. Cell. 1996; 85: 61-69Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar). Cell attachment assays showed that expression of v-Src or c-Src527 decreased the attachment of 293 cells to fibronectin by 60–70% (Fig. 7). As the transfection efficiency in the 293 cells was about 70% (not shown), this level of reduction indicates that the transfected cells have become essentially non-adhesive. The ability of v-Src to decrease cell adhesion was partially suppressed by the co-expression of the R-Ras38VY66F mutant, but not by R-Ras38V (Fig. 7). Similar results were obtained with c-Src527, and by plating the cells on type I collagen instead of fibronectin (data not shown). These results suggest that activated Src inhibits cell adhesion through phosphorylation of R-Ras, which suppresses the ability of R-Ras to support integrin activity. We show here that activated Src can phosphorylate a tyrosine residue in R-Ras that is located in the effector domain of R-Ras. The phosphorylation of this effector domain residue affects the ability of R-Ras to regulate integrin activation. As a consequence, integrin-mediated cell adhesion is impaired. This mechanism may, at least in part, explain the reduced cell adhesion that is characteristic of Src-transformed cells. Earlier results have shown that the activity of endogenous R-Ras is required for cells to maintain their ability to attach to extracellular matrix substrates through integrins (10Zhang Z. Vuori K. Wang H. Reed J.C. Ruoslahti E. Cell. 1996; 85: 61-69Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the ability of the activated EphB2 receptor to decrease cell adhesion is mediated by the phosphorylation of R-Ras (11Zou J.X. Wang B. Kalo M.S. Zisch A.H. Pasquale E.B. Ruoslahti E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 13813-13818Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). EphA2 has a similar effect on cell adhesion (12Miao H. Burnett E. Kinch M. Simon E. Wang B. Nature Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 62-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar), indicating that this Eph receptor may also act through R-Ras. The present results indicate that v-Src and constitutively activated c-Src reduce cell adhesion at least in part by the same mechanism as the Eph receptors. Cell transformation by v-Src causes a pleiotropic change in cellular properties, including loss of normal growth control, reduced adhesion and cell rounding. The mechanism underlying this v-Src-induced transformation is still obscure. Previous studies have shown that the ability of v-Src to induce changes in cell structure and morphology is independent of changes in gene expression (18Beug H. Claviez M. Jockusch B.M. Graf T. Cell. 1978; 14: 843-856Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 19Frame M.C. Simpson K. Fincham V.J. Crouch D.H. Cell. 1994; 5: 1177-1184Google Scholar) and, therefore, most likely a direct result of the tyrosine kinase activity of Src. Many of the known v-Src targets are associated with the cellular cytoskeletal network and focal adhesions (14Fincham V.J. Brunton V.G. Frame M.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 6518-6536Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 15Schaller M.D. Hildebrand J.D. Parsons J.T. Mol. Biol.

Chem. 2000; 275: 23333-23339Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Our results showing that oncogenic Src also phosphorylates R-Ras add a new and potentially important substrate to the list of proteins phosphorylated by Src. The binding of Src to R-Ras is another novel aspect of our findings. The R-Ras variant resistant to Src phosphorylation only partially reversed the effects of oncogenic Src on cell adhesion, suggesting the existence of additional pathways whereby Src can affect cell adhesion. H-Ras, which like Src interferes with integrin activity, regulates integrins through the ERK MAPK pathway (6Hughes P.E. Renshaw M.W. Pfaff M. Forsyth J. Keivens V.M. Schwartz M.A. Ginsberg M.H. Cell. 1997; 88: 521-530Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar). As Src is capable of activating ERK, this pathway could contribute to the effects of Src transformation on cell adhesion. c-Src has been found to be activated in colon cancers metastatic to the liver (21Talmonti M.S. Roh M.S. Curley S.A. Gallick G.E. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 91: 53-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar, 22Termuheln P.M. Curley S.A. Talamonti M.S. Saboorian M.H. Gallick G.E. J. Surg. Res. 1993; 54: 293-298Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). A truncating mutation in human c-Src at codon 531 (corresponding to 528 in chicken c-Src) has been found in 12% of cases of advanced human colon cancer (23Irby R.B. Mao W. Coppola D. Kang J. Loubeau J.M. Trudeau W. Karl R. Fujita D.J. Jove R. Yeatman T.J. Nature Genetics. 1999; 21: 187-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar). This mutation activates c-Src, conferring transforming, tumorigenic and metastasis-promoting activity to Src. We tested another similarly activated c-Src mutant, c-Src527 (23Irby R.B. Mao W.

Cartwright C.A. Hunter T. Science. 1986; 231: 1431-1434Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar), and found that it phosphorylated R-Ras as effectively as v-Src. As reduced cell adhesion can promote tumor invasion and metastasis (2Ruoslahti E. Adv. Cancer Res. 1999; 76: 1-20Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the Src-R-Ras pathway we describe here may contribute to the oncogenic properties of Src. However, as activation of the αvβ3 integrin has been shown to promote rather than to inhibit metastasis (25Felding-Habermann B. O'Toole T.E. Smith J.W. Fransvea E. Ruggeri Z.M. Ginsberg M.H. Hughes P.E. Pampori N. Shattil S.J. Saven A. Mueller B.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 1853-1858Crossref PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar), the effects of the Src-integrin pathway on tumor progression may be complex. Although our results do not address that question, regulating cell adhesion through R-Ras phosphorylation may also be part of the normal function of c-Src.

Trends Genet. 1995; 11: 69-74Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (818) Google Scholar). At present, the Jak family consists of four mammalian members Jak1, Jak2, Jak3, and Tyk2 (6Ihle J.N. Nature. 1995; 377: 591-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (1139) Google Scholar). A single Jak homologue has been identified inDrosophila as the gene associated with hopscotch(hop) mutations (7Binari R. Perrimin N. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 300-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). Jaks appear to be constitutively associated with the membrane-proximal intracellular domains of cytokine receptors and become rapidly phosphorylated after ligand binding and dimerization or oligomerization of the receptor chains. This is followed by a cascade of events generating cytokine-mediated gene transcription. Activated Jaks phosphorylate tyrosine residues at distal parts of the intracellular domains of the receptor chains, thereby generating docking sites for signal transducers and activators of transcription (STATs) and other intracellular signaling molecules (8Darnell J.E. Science. 1997; 277: 1630-1635Crossref PubMed Scopus (3346) Google Scholar). STATs, which are recruited to the specific phosphotyrosine-containing motifs located in the cytoplasmic part of the receptors, are in turn phosphorylated by activated Jaks at distinct tyrosine residues (3Pestka S.

In addition to their role in cytokine signaling, Jak kinases may play a more diverse role in mammalian physiology. The Jaks are activated in response to acute pressure load suggesting a role for Jak kinases in cardiovascular physiology (11Pan J. Fukuda K. Kodama H. Makino S. Takahashi T. Sano M. Hori S. Ogawa S.

Life Sci. 1999; 64: 2173-2186Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), it is of interest to identify proteins interacting with Jak kinases.To identify novel proteins involved in Jak signaling, we employed the yeast two-hybrid system with Jak2 as a bait (17Pollack B.P.

Homozygous mutation of thel(2)tid locus results in the development of lethal tumors at the time of puparium formation (23Kurzic-Dumke U. Gundacker D. Rentrop M. Gateff E. Dev. Genet. 1995; 16: 64-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). These tumors are derived from imaginal discs, which fail to differentiate. The imaginal discs are groups of cells that give rise to adult appendages and whose proliferation behavior is unlike other embryonic tissue ofDrosophila (24Edgar B.A. Lehner C.F. Science. 1996; 274: 1646-1652Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). The isolation of a human homologue of theDrosophila Tid56 protein in a yeast two-hybrid system with viral oncoprotein E7 of human papilloma virus 16 as bait was reported (25Schilling B. De-Medina T. Syken J. Vidal M. Munger K. Virology. 1998; 247: 74-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Subsequently, two splice variants of this gene, hTid-1S and hTid-1L, were identified. The two isoforms hTid-1S and hTid-1L have opposing effects on apoptosis in response to tumor necrosis factor-α or mitomycin C (26Syken J. De-Medina T. Munger K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 8499-8504Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar).In the present report, we demonstrate that hTid-1 proteins (hTid-1S and hTid-1L) interact with Jak2in vivo. Furthermore, hTid-1S and hTid-1L interact with the IFN-γ receptor chain IFN-γR2 with which Jak2 remains associated. In addition, we show that hTid-1 interacts with the Hsp70/Hsc70 family of chaperones in IFN-γ-responsive HEp2 cells and the interaction is reduced in the presence of IFN-γ. We also present evidence that overexpression of the TID1 gene modulates IFN-γ-mediated signaling. Our data suggest that hTid-1 is a modulator of the Jak-STAT pathway.DISCUSSIONJak kinases are crucial for signal transduction via the Jak-STAT pathway (2Stark G. Kerr I.M. Williams B.R.G.

In addition to their interactions with cytokine receptor chains, Jak kinases are known to interact with other signaling proteins. Jak2 interacts with SHPTP1 (42Jiao H. Berrada K. Yang W. Tabrizi M.

The ability to interact with diverse proteins underscores the complex role of Jak2, which is activated by a majority of ligands that utilize the Jak-STAT pathway. The physiological roles for these interactions have not been fully characterized, nevertheless, they suggest that the Jaks play a role in other pathways and/or facilitate cross-talk between signaling pathways.Jak2 is required for the proliferative response to many growth factors such as erythropoietin and growth hormone. A kinase-deficient Jak2 can block an erythropoietin-induced mitogenic signal (31Kotenko S.V. Izotova L.S. Mirochnitchenko O.V. Lee C. Pestka S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci U. S. A. 1999; 96: 5007-5012Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Hyperactivation of Jak2 has been seen in a number of malignancies, and inhibition of Jak activity has been shown to reverse the malignant phenotype of leukemic cells (51Meydan N. Grunberger T. Dati H. Shahar M. Arpiaia E. Lapidot Z. Leeder J.S. Freeman M. Cohen A. Gazit A. Levitzki A. Roifman C.M. Nature. 1996; 379: 645-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (847) Google Scholar, 52Peeters P.

Similarly, mutations causing overactivity of the Jak homologue hopscotch have been reported to cause a leukemic-like syndrome in Drosophila (54Harrison D.A. Binari R. Nahreini T.S. Gilman M. Perrimon N. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2857-2865Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar, 55Hou X.S. Perrimon N. Trends Genet. 1997; 13: 105-110Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Consistent with their functional and sequence homology, mutation of homologous residues in hopscotch and Jak2 cause both proteins to become hyperactive (56Luo H. Rose P. Barber D. Hanratty W.P. Lee S. Roberts T.M. D'Andrea A.D. Dearoff C.R. Mol. Cell Biol. 1997; 17: 1562-1571Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). These reports suggest that Jak2 activity is involved in the control of proliferation and that uncontrolled activation of Jak2 causes the loss of proliferative control.We used the yeast two-hybrid system to screen an HeLa cell library to identify novel Jak2-interacting proteins. One protein identified in this screen, hTid-1, has high homology to Tid56, the protein encoded by the D. melanogaster tumor suppressor gene l(2)tid(23Kurzic-Dumke U. Gundacker D. Rentrop M. Gateff E. Dev. Genet. 1995; 16: 64-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Tid56 and hTid-1 have 65.8 and 54.9% amino acid similarity and identity, respectively, and thus have been well conserved through evolution. Schilling et al. (25Schilling B. De-Medina T. Syken J. Vidal M. Munger K. Virology. 1998; 247: 74-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) cloned TID1cDNA during a screen for proteins, which interact with the human papilloma virus type 16 E7 oncoprotein. Our clone is identical to an alternatively spliced form of TID1 designated as hTid-1S except for an Asn to Tyr change at amino acid 75. The motifs conserved between Tid56 and hTid-1 include the N-terminal J domain containing the highly conserved HPD tripeptide, a glycine/phenylalanine-rich region and four CXXCXG(XG) repeats and a less conserved C-terminal region (23Kurzic-Dumke U. Gundacker D. Rentrop M. Gateff E. Dev. Genet. 1995; 16: 64-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 25Schilling B. De-Medina T. Syken J. Vidal M. Munger K. Virology. 1998; 247: 74-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 26Syken J. De-Medina T. Munger K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 8499-8504Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar).Drosophila Tid56 and its human homologue hTid-1 represent members of the DnaJ family, which function as molecular chaperones. DnaJ proteins contain a highly conserved tetrahelical domain that binds to the DnaK proteins and their eukaryotic homologues, Hsp70 proteins, and thereby regulate their activity and confer substrate specificity to Hsp70 proteins. In Drosophila, Tid56 is involved in the regulation of cell growth and death as evidenced by the hyperproliferative phenotype of the Tid56 mutant embryo (23Kurzic-Dumke U. Gundacker D. Rentrop M. Gateff E. Dev. Genet. 1995; 16: 64-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the Jak homologue hopscotch inDrosophila is required for the proliferation of diploid imaginal cells (57Perrimon N. Mahowald A.P. Dev. Biol. 1986; 118: 28-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Because mutations in Tid56 and the Jak2 homologuehopscotch confer similar phenotypic effects inDrosophila, it is possible that Tid56 is a modulator of Jak2 activity. A common link between these two pathways is likely.We have shown that two splice variants of TID1, hTid-1S or hTid-1L, interact with Jak2 in vivo in COS-1 cells transfected with corresponding cDNAs. Interaction between the endogenous Jak2 and hTid-1S or hTid-1L was demonstrated in human HEp2 cells, and hTid-1 remains associated with Jak2 after IFN-γ treatment when dimerization and oligomerization of receptor chains occur following phosphorylation of Jak2. This observation prompted us to test the hypothesis that hTid-1 forms a complex with Jak2 and IFN-γR2. In cells transfected with corresponding cDNAs, we observed that Jak2 and IFN-γR2 coimmunoprecipitated with hTid-1. Interaction between hTid-1 and Hsp70/Hsc70 molecular chaperones were shown in HEp2 cells (Fig. 6). This interaction is significantly reduced after IFN-γ treatment. Hsp70 family members and their associated DnaJ cochaperones mediate a number of cellular functions such as folding of newly synthesized polypeptides, the translocation of proteins across membranes, and assembly of multimeric protein complexes. Recently, DnaJ cochaperones were shown to be components of intracellular signaling pathways linked to cell survival and growth regulation. Studies in a variety of systems involving receptors, protein-tyrosine kinases, and chaperone proteins emphasized the physiological relevance of such interactions. Genetic studies in yeast have demonstrated that binding of steroid receptors, the dioxin receptor, and some protein kinases to Hsp90 is critical for their signal transduction in vivo (58Pratt W.B. Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol. Med. 1998; 217: 420-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar). The interferon-induced double-stranded RNA-activated protein kinase is inhibited by p58IPK, which contains a DnaJ motif (59Melville M.W. Hansen W.J. Freeman B.C. Welch W.J. Katze M.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 97-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar).Based on our observations, we propose a model of hTid-1-mediated modulation of IFN-γ signaling (Fig.10). We propose that Jak2 and γR2 associate with hTid-1 and Hsp70/Hsc70 to form a complex. hTid-1 recruits Hsp70/Hsc70 to the receptor complex, and Jak2 may be a substrate for Hsp70/Hsc70. We propose that hTid-1 acts as a cochaperone causing a conformational change in Hsp70/Hsc70 that allows it to interact with Jak2. The interaction of Hsp70/Hsc70 with Jak2 then inhibits the kinase activity of Jak2. It has been proposed that the maintenance of proper protein intermediate states might be important for the normal function of many substrate proteins, particularly those that participate in the assembly of multimeric complex structures and those that participate in signaling pathways (40Kelley W.L. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 222-227Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). Upon IFN-γ treatment, Hsp70/Hsc70 and then hTid-1 are released from the complex thereby activating the kinase function of Jak2. Because the overexpression of hTid-1 inhibits IFN-γ-mediated signaling, we envision that hTid-1 is released from the Jak2·IFN-γR2 complex to initiate signal transduction. Jak2 autophosphorylation in response to IFN-γ remains unaltered in COS-1 cells overexpressing h-Tid-1 as compared with the control (Fig. 3E). Therefore, we propose that inhibition of IFN-γ-induced luciferase activity by hTid-1 is related to the interference of Jak2-mediated receptor phosphorylation or STAT-1 phosphorylation. We observed that the Hsp70/Hsc70 and Jak2 interaction is not affected by IFN-γ treatment (Fig. 6B), a result that is likely due to the fact that Hsp70/Hsc70 interacts with Jak2 that is not part of the IFN-γ receptor complex.The Jak-STAT signaling pathway can induce proliferation and differentiation and is crucial for the proper growth and development of mammalian tissues, particularly those of hematopoietic lineages. Moreover, hyperactivation of Jak2 is implicated in leukemia. Therefore, Jak2 activation needs to be tightly regulated. Our data suggest that hTid-1 is a negative modulator of the Jak-STAT pathway. To our knowledge this is the first report of a human DnaJ protein interacting with the Jak2 and IFN-γ receptor complex. Further understanding of the physiological significance of Jak2, hTid-1, and Hsp70/Hsc70 interactions could shed light on the effects of hTid-1 (Tid56) in tumor suppression and cell growth. IFN-γ1 is a multifunctional cytokine that plays a variety of immunomodulatory and antineoplastic functions, including regulation of cell proliferation, cytotoxic differentiation, and apoptosis of T-lymphocytes. IFN-γ participates in immune surveillance and tumor suppression (1Pestka S. Langer J.A. Zoon K.C. Samuel C.E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1987; 5C: 727-777Crossref Scopus (1593) Google Scholar, 2Stark G. Kerr I.M. Williams B.R.G. Silverman R.H. Schrieber R.D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 227-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (3361) Google Scholar). The biological activities of IFN-γ are mediated through a heterodimeric transmembrane receptor capable of activating the Jak-STAT pathway (3Pestka S. Kotenko S.V. Muthukumaran G. Izotova L.S. Cook J.R. Garotta G. Cytokine Growth Factor Rev. 1997; 8: 189-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar, 4Soh J. Donnelly R.J. Kotenko S. Mariano T.M. Cook J.R. Wang N. Emanuel S.L. Schwartz B. Miki T. Pestka S. Cell. 1994; 76: 793-802Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). Tyrosine kinases of the Janus kinase (Jak) family play a crucial role in signal transduction via cytokine receptors (5Ihle J.N. Kerr I.M. Trends Genet. 1995; 11: 69-74Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (818) Google Scholar). At present, the Jak family consists of four mammalian members Jak1, Jak2, Jak3, and Tyk2 (6Ihle J.N. Nature. 1995; 377: 591-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (1139) Google Scholar). A single Jak homologue has been identified inDrosophila as the gene associated with hopscotch(hop) mutations (7Binari R. Perrimin N. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 300-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). Jaks appear to be constitutively associated with the membrane-proximal intracellular domains of cytokine receptors and become rapidly phosphorylated after ligand binding and dimerization or oligomerization of the receptor chains. This is followed by a cascade of events generating cytokine-mediated gene transcription. Activated Jaks phosphorylate tyrosine residues at distal parts of the intracellular domains of the receptor chains, thereby generating docking sites for signal transducers and activators of transcription (STATs) and other intracellular signaling molecules (8Darnell J.E. Science. 1997; 277: 1630-1635Crossref PubMed Scopus (3346) Google Scholar). STATs, which are recruited to the specific phosphotyrosine-containing motifs located in the cytoplasmic part of the receptors, are in turn phosphorylated by activated Jaks at distinct tyrosine residues (3Pestka S. Kotenko S.V. Muthukumaran G. Izotova L.S. Cook J.R. Garotta G. Cytokine Growth Factor Rev. 1997; 8: 189-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar, 8Darnell J.E.

Ihle J.N. Pestka S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20915-20921Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Following phosphorylation STATs form homo- and heterodimers then translocate to the nucleus and bind to specific response elements of genes leading to their transcriptional activation (8Darnell J.E. Science. 1997; 277: 1630-1635Crossref PubMed Scopus (3346) Google Scholar, 10Ihle J.N. Cell. 1996; 84: 331-334Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1262) Google Scholar). In addition to their role in cytokine signaling, Jak kinases may play a more diverse role in mammalian physiology. The Jaks are activated in response to acute pressure load suggesting a role for Jak kinases in cardiovascular physiology (11Pan J. Fukuda K. Kodama H. Makino S. Takahashi T. Sano M. Hori S. Ogawa S. Circ. Res. 1997; 81: 611-617Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). The Jaks have been linked to gliogenesis, consistent with a role for Jak kinases in central nervous system, and Jaks have been suggested to regulate potassium channels in response to prolactin (12Bonni A.

Peg3/Pw1, originally identified as a paternally expressed gene, is a large molecule containing 12 zinc finger-like domains and 2 proline-rich periodic repeat domains (7Kuroiwa Y. Kaneko-Ishino T. Kagitani F. Kohda T. Li L.L. Tada M. Suzuki R. Yokoyama M. Shiroishi T. Wakana S. Barton S.C. Ishino F. Surani M.A. Nat. Genet. 1996; 12: 186-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). The expression of Peg3/Pw1 mRNA was detected ubiquitously in all tissues at low levels during mouse development, and in adult mouse, Peg3/Pw1 expression was observed abundantly in central nervous system and skeletal muscle (7Kuroiwa Y. Kaneko-Ishino T. Kagitani F. Kohda T. Li L.L. Tada M. Suzuki R. Yokoyama M. Shiroishi T. Wakana S. Barton S.C. Ishino F. Surani M.A. Nat.

In human, Peg3/Pw1 mRNA was observed at high levels in ovary, testis, and placenta and at modest levels in brain and pancreas (9Kim J. Ashworth L. Branscomb E. Stubbs L. Genome Res. 1997; 7: 532-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Its subcellular localization was observed in the nucleus (10Relaix F. Weng X. Marazzi G. Yang E. Copeland N. Jenkins N. Spence S.E. Sassoon D. Dev. Biol. 1996; 177: 383-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar), and Peg3/Pw1 was shown to be involved in the tumor necrosis factor-NF-κB signal transduction pathway through interacting with TRAF2 in some experimental system (8Relaix F. Wei X.J. Wu X. Sassoon D.A. Nat. Genet. 1998; 18: 287-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Recently it was reported that Peg3/Pw1 is up-regulated in the p53-mediated cell death pathway and involved in p53-mediated apoptosis through translocating Bax from cytosol to mitochondria (11Deng Y. Wu X. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 12050-12055Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar) or interacting with members of Siah (seven inabsentia homology) family in mouse fibroblast cells (12Relaix F. Wei X.-J. Li W.

Moreover, Peg3/Pw1 was specifically activated during p53/c-Myc-mediated and p53/E2F-1-mediated apoptosis but not during p53-dependent G1 arrest, and the inhibition of Peg3/Pw1 function blocked p53/c-Myc-mediated cell death, whereas Peg3/Pw1 expression alone did not induce apoptosis, suggesting that Peg3/Pw1 is involved in the cell death pathway downstream of p53 (12Relaix F. Wei X.-J. Li W. Pan J. Lin Y. Bowtell D.D. Sassoon D.A. Wu X. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 2105-2110Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). To investigate the molecular mechanism underlying the cell death pathway in response to brain ischemia/hypoxia, we identified the genes whose mRNA expressions are induced under hypoxic insult by a differential display technique using primary cultured astroglial cells. We found that Peg3/Pw1 mRNA expression was up-regulated in peri-ischemic neuronal cells in rat middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCA-O)1 model, where the induction of p53 protein expression was also observed by immunohistochemical analysis. In this study, we examined whether Peg3/Pw1 is involved in the p53-mediated cell death pathway under ischemic/hypoxic insult using rat MCA-O model and human neuroblastoma-derived SK-N-SH cells. Both the mouse full-length Peg3/Pw1 cDNA and C-terminal-deleted Peg3/Pw1 cDNA (gifts from Dr. Sassoon, The Mount Sinai Medical Center, New York, NY) were digested with BamHI and XhoI then directly subcloned into pEGFP plasmid (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA), which produces the N-terminal GFP-tagged protein under the control of CMV promoter. To generate antisense Peg3/Pw1 construct, Peg3/Pw1 cDNA was subcloned into pCDNA3(−) (Invitrogen) in reverse direction. The DNA was transfected into cells using LipofectAMINE reagent (Invitrogen) as described by the manufacturer. Stable cell lines were generated by selecting the transfected cells in neomycin (1200 μg/ml) for about 2 weeks. Rat cortex neurons or astroglial cells were prepared from Sprague-Dawley rat E17 embryo or postnatal day 1 pups, respectively, as described previously (13Tamatani M. Che Y.H. Matsuzaki H. Ogawa S.

Briefly, cerebral hemispheres were dissected, and the meninges were carefully removed. Brain tissues were digested with collagenase B (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) at 37 °C for 15 min. Tissues were further dissociated by repeated trituration. The neuronal cells were seeded at a density of 1 × 10 6 cells/cm2 on poly-l-lysine (10 μg/ml)-coated plates (Falcon Lab and Maintainware, Lincoln Park, NJ) and grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with B27 supplement (Invitrogen), 30 mm glucose, and 0.5% (v/v) penicillin-streptomycin at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 and 95% room air. In experiments using primary cultured neurons, all experiments were performed in 8- to 10-day-old cultures. Astroglial cells were seeded at a density of 1 × 10 6cells/cm2 in 175-cm2 culture flasks and grown in α-modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal calf serum for 10 days and agitated strongly on a shaking platform to separate astrocytes from microglial and oligodendroglial cells. Astroglial cells were then placed into 150-mm diameter dishes and grown for an additional 7 days. In experiments using astroglial cells, all experiments were performed when cultured astrocytes achieved 80% confluence. Hypoxia treatment was performed using an incubator attached to a hypoxia chamber (Coy Laboratory Products, Ann Arbor, MI) that maintained a humidified atmosphere with low oxygen tension (pO2, 12–14 torr) as described previously (15Ogawa S. Gerlach H. Esposito C. Pasagian-Macaulay A. Brett J. Stern D. J. Clin. Invest. 1990; 85: 1090-1098Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). Before exposure to hypoxia, the growth medium was replaced with a serum-free medium that consisted of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium for neuronal cells, α-modified Eagle's medium for astroglial cells, and SK-N-SH cells supplemented with 30 mm glucose and 0.5% (v/v) penicillin-streptomycin. Where indicated, after exposure to hypoxia, cultures were returned to the ambient atmosphere (re-oxygenation) at which time the condition medium was rapidly exchanged for medium containing 10% fetal calf serum. In other experiments, cells were exposed to either calcium ionophoreA23187 (1 μm for 12 h) (Sigma) or tunicamycin (1 μg/ml for 12 h) (Sigma). When exposed to hydrogen peroxide, cells were returned to normal medium after a 5-min exposure to hydrogen peroxide (88 nm) (Wako Chemicals, Osaka, Japan) and incubated for an additional 2 h. Alternatively, cultures were subjected to heat shock at 42 °C for 1 h, then returned to 37 °C and incubated for an additional 2 h. AxCANLZ, which expresses LacZ under control of the CAG promoter, was generously provided by Dr. Saito (University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan). Another recombinant adenovirus vector, Ad5CMVp53, which expresses p53 protein under the control of CMV promoter, was generously provided by Dr. Roth (University of Texas, Houston, TX) (16Zhang W.W. Fang X. Mazur W. French B.A. Georges R.N. Roth J.A. Cancer Gene Ther. 1994; 1: 5-13PubMed Google Scholar). All viruses were grown in 293 cells. Virus titers were determined by plaque assay, and concentrated virus was stored at −80 °C. Infection was carried out by adding recombinant adenovirus to serum-containing medium. The cells were incubated with virus-containing medium at the indicated multiplicity of infection at 37 °C for 60 min with constant agitation. Cell viability was assessed by determining the release of lactate dehydrogenase into the culture medium thereby indicating a loss of membrane integrity and cell death. Lactate dehydrogenase activity was measured using a commercial kit (Kyokuto Chemical Co., Tokyo, Japan) in which a colorimetric assay measures the pyruvate-mediated conversion of 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine into a visible hydrazone precipitate. Percent neuronal viability was expressed as (1 − experimental value/maximum release) × 100, where the maximum release was obtained after exposure of untreated control cultures to 0.2% Triton X-100 for 15 min at 37 °C. Cell extracts for Western blot analysis were prepared by washing the cells three times with PBS and lysing them in sample buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 20 mm EDTA, 1% SDS, and 100 mm NaCl). The samples were boiled for 5 min before subjecting 20-μl aliquots to electrophoresis on 7.5, 10, and 12% SDS-PAGE gels. After the proteins were transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA), the membrane was incubated in blocking buffer (1× PBS, 5% non-fat dried milk) for 1 h at room temperature and then probed with a primary antibody in blocking buffer overnight at 4 °C. The membrane was washed four times in PBS containing 0.3% Tween 20, probed with the secondary antibody in blocking buffer for 1 h at room temperature, and washed again in PBS containing 0.05% Tween 20. Detection of signal was performed with an enhanced chemiluminescence detection kit (ECL; Amersham Biosciences, Inc.). The primary antibodies used were anti-p53 monoclonal antibody (DO-1; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA), anti-Bax polyclonal antibody (number P-19; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA), anti-KDEL monoclonal antibody (StressGen Biotechnologies Corp., San Diego, CA), anti-β-tubulin polyclonal antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), and anti-GFP monoclonal antibody (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA). Total RNA derived from 2 × 107 cells was extracted from cells by the acid guanidium-thiocyanate/phenol chloroform method. For Northern blot analysis, total RNA (20 μg/lane) was separated by electrophoresis on 1.0% agarose/formide gels and transferred overnight onto polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA). The membrane was prehybridized for 1 h at 65 °C in hybridization buffer (0.9 m NaCl, 90 mm sodium citrate, pH 7.0) containing 5× Denhardt's solution, SDS (0.5%), and heat-denatured salmon sperm DNA (100 ng/ml). cDNA probe was radiolabeled with [32P]dCTP (NZ522; PerkinElmer Life Sciences) by a random labeling kit according to the manufacturer's manual (Takara Shuzo Co., Ltd., Shiga, Japan). After hybridization overnight at 65 °C in hybridization buffer containing radiolabeled cDNA probe (5 ng/ml), filters were washed twice with 2× SSC, 0.5% SDS and 0.2× SSC, 0.5% SDS for 60 min, respectively, at 65 °C, exposed to x-ray film (Fuji Photo Film), and subjected to autoradiography. For RT-PCR, 5 μg of total RNA was reverse-transcribed using oligo(dT) by reverse transcriptase from Moloney murine leukemia virus (Invitrogen) in a volume of 25 μl. For PCR amplification, specific oligonucleotide primer pairs (10 pmol each) were incubated with 1 μl of cDNA template in a 20-μl PCR reaction mixture containing 1.5 mm MgCl2, 25 mm KCl, 10 mm Tris, pH 9.2, mixed deoxynucleotides (1 mm each), and 1 unit of Taqpolymerase. The sequences of primers used in this study were as follows: rat Peg3/Pw1 sense primer, 5′-GAGAATCCTCCATTTATATC-3′ and rat Peg3/Pw1 antisense primer, 5′-TCATGAATCTTCTGGTGCTC-3′; human Peg3/Pw1 sense primer, 5′-TACGAATGTAAGGTGTGTGG-3′ and human Peg3/Pw1 antisense primer, 5′-TTGGCACGGAATACACTCTG-3′; human Bax sense primer, 5′-ATGGACGGGTCCGGGGAGCA-3′ and, human Bax antisense primer, 5′-CAGACACGTAAGGAAAACGC-3′; human GRP78 sense primer, 5′-TTATTTGGGAAAGAAGGTTAC-3′ and human GRP78 antisense primer, 5′-ATTGAAGAACTCTTTAACCAG-3′; rat GRP78 sense primer, 5′-GGTCTACGAAGGTGAACGAC-3′ and rat GRP78 antisense primer, 5′-CAATTTCTTCTAGTTCCTTC-3′; and as an internal control rat or human β-actin sense primer, 5′-TGCCCATCTATGAGGGTTACG-3′ and rat or human β-actin antisense primer, 5′-TAGAAGCATTTGCGGTGCACG-3′. Mus musculus Peg3, accession number AF038939; human Bax, accession number NM_004324; human Peg3, accession number XM_042345; human GRP78, accession number XM_044202; human β-actin, accession number XM_037235; rat β-actin, accession number NM_031144; rat GRP78, accession number S63521. Dilutions of cDNA were amplified for 23–32 cycles at 94 °C for 30 s, 55 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 30 s. The amplified PCR products at each cycle number were analyzed by 1% agarose gel electrophoresis and ethidium bromide staining. The product of constitutively expressed β-actin mRNA served as the internal standard. All the products were assayed in the linear response range of the RT-PCR amplification process; the cycle number used was determined by finding the midpoint of linear amplification on a sigmoid curve for amplification products with cycle numbers of 24–40 plotted against band density. The identity of each PCR product was confirmed by subcloning the amplified cDNAs into the pGEM-T vector (Promega) and sequencing. In Northern blot analysis, amplified cDNAs were used as probes to detect human and rat Peg3/Pw1 or human GRP78 transcripts. Unilateral permanent MCA-O was performed in 9-week-old male Sprague-Dawley rats (300–325 g) that were purchased from Japan SLC (Sizuoka, Japan) as described previously with minor modification (17Tamura A. Graham D.I. McCulloch J. Teasdale G.M. J Cereb. Blood Flow Metab. 1981; 1: 53-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (1218) Google Scholar, 18Yamashita T. Kohmura E. Yamauchi A. Shimada S. Yuguchi T. Sakaki T. Miyai A. Tohyama M. Hayakawa T. J Cereb. Blood Flow Metab. 1996; 16: 1203-1210Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Briefly, rats were anesthetized with halothane (4% for induction, 1.5% for maintenance) in a mixture of 70% nitrous oxide and 30% oxygen delivered through a close-fitting facemask during surgery. A vertical incision was made between the left orbit and the external auditory canal. The temporalis muscle was cut, and subtemporal craniotomy was performed without removing the zygomatic arch under an operation microscope. The main trunk of the MCA and olfactory tract were observed through the dura mater. The left MCA was exposed by a microsurgical approach, and the MCA was occluded by bipolar electrocoagulation. The MCA from proximal to the olfactory tract to the inferior cerebral vein and the lenticulostriate arteries were permanently occluded and transected to avoid recanalization. After occlusion of the MCA, the temporalis muscle and skin were closed in layers, and anesthesia was discontinued. Rectal temperature of rats was maintained at 38.0 ± 0.5 °C with a heating pad (TR-100, PS-100; Fine Science Tools, Belmont, CA) during the surgery. Brains were removed, and serial brain sections (10–15 μm) were obtained from the frozen brains with a cryostat and stored in a tightly closed case at −80 °C. Frozen sections (10–15-μm-thick) of adult mouse brain were cut in various planes and thaw-mounted onto poly-l-lysine-coated slides. [35S]-Labeled or digoxigenin-labeled cRNA probes (sense or antisense) were prepared by in vitro transcription using T7 or SP6 polymerase from the coding of rat Peg3/Pw1 cDNA subcloned into pGEM-T vector (Promega). All steps of in situhybridization reactions were carried out essentially according to Simmons et al. (19Simmons D.M. Arizza V.L. Swanson L.W. J. Histotechnol. 1989; 12: 169-181Crossref Google Scholar). Briefly, the sections were dried, fixed in 4% formaldehyde, treated with proteinase K (10 μg/ml, room temperature, 30 min), acetylated, dehydrated, and air-dried prior to hybridization overnight at 55 °C in a humidified chamber with 150–200 μl of hybridization buffer (10% sodium dextran sulfate, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.3 m NaCl, 0.2% sarcosyl, 0.02% heat-denatured salmon sperm DNA, 1× Denhardt's solution, 50% formamide) with a cRNA probe. After being rinsed in 5× SSC at 60 °C for 20 min and washed in 50% formamide/2× SSC at 60 °C for 30 min, sections were subjected to RNase digestion for 20 min at 37 °C (1 μg/ml RNase A) and washed in 50% formamide/2× SSC at 60 °C for 30 min. For detection of hybridized digoxigenin-labeled cRNA probes, anti-digoxigenin antibody conjugated to alkaline phosphatase (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) was reacted with 1:500 dilution, and color was developed by incubation with 4-nitro blue tetrazolium chloride. For detection of hybridized [35S]-labeled cRNA probes, sections were exposed to x-ray film (Fuji Photo Film) and subjected to autoradiography. For immunohistochemistry, frozen sections were dried, fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde solution, incubated in blocking buffer (1× PBS, 5% non-fat dried milk) for 1 h at room temperature, and reacted with anti-p53 monoclonal antibody (PharMingen) in blocking buffer for 1 h at room temperature, followed by incubation with Alexa Fluor 488 anti-mouse IgG conjugate (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) or biotinylated anti-mouse IgG secondary antibody (Vector Laboratories Inc., Burlingame, CA). For detection of fluorescent secondary antibody binding sites, sections were photographed under laser confocal microscopy (Carl Zeiss LSM510). Sites of biotinylated secondary antibody binding were visualized using a Vectastain Elite ABC kit according to manufacturer's manual (Vector Laboratories Inc., Burlingame, CA). For double staining of p53 protein by immunohistochemistry and rat Peg3/Pw1 mRNA by in situhybridization, frozen sections were reacted with anti-p53 monoclonal antibody (PharMingen) followed by incubation with Alexa Fluor 488 anti-mouse IgG conjugate (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). The sections were photographed under laser confocal microscopy (Carl Zeiss LSM510) subsequent to in situ hybridization analysis using digoxigenin-labeled cRNA probe for rat Peg3/Pw1. Using primary cultured astroglial cells exposed to hypoxia, we have identified the genes whose expressions are enhanced in hypoxic insult by differential display methods as described previously (20Yamaguchi A. Hori O. Stern D.M. Hartmann E. Ogawa S. Tohyama M. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 1195-1204Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1A, Peg3/Pw1 mRNA expression was induced 16–24 h after exposure to hypoxia and returned to basal levels upon re-oxygenation in rat primary cultured astroglial cells. Next, to investigate what kind of insults induce Peg3/Pw1 mRNA expression, we exposed primary cultured astroglial cells to various stresses and performed Northern blotting analysis using total RNAs extracted from those astroglial cells. Enhanced Peg3/Pw1 mRNA expressions were observed in hypoxia or heat shock stress (Fig. 1B). We then examined whether Peg3/Pw1 mRNA expression was up-regulated in primary cultured cortex neurons under hypoxic conditions by RT-PCR analysis. We exposed rat primary cultured cortex neurons to hypoxia or re-oxygenation for the indicated times, and performed RT-PCR analysis using first strand cDNAs synthesized from total RNAs extracted from those neurons as templates. Similar to the results in astroglial cells, Peg3/Pw1 mRNA expression was enhanced 12–24 h post-hypoxia and returned to basal levels upon re-oxygenation in primary cultured neurons (Fig.1C). Previous reports have shown that in human tissues Peg3/Pw1 expression is abundant in ovary, placenta, testis, and brain and that in adult mouse the highest expression levels are observed in brain and muscle (7Kuroiwa Y. Kaneko-Ishino T. Kagitani F. Kohda T. Li L.L. Tada M. Suzuki R. Yokoyama M. Shiroishi T. Wakana S. Barton S.C. Ishino F. Surani M.A. Nat.

We found that Peg3/Pw1 mRNA expression was remarkably abundant in brain, and we could not detect Peg3/Pw1 mRNA expression in other organs including heart, lung, liver, muscle, and kidney in our experiment (Fig. 1D). To address whether Peg3/Pw1 mRNA expression is enhanced in brain ischemia/hypoxia, we performed in situhybridization using [35S]-labeled Peg3/Pw1 cRNA probe in serial brain coronal sections derived from the rat permanent MCA-O model. Fig. 2, A–D shows that in the rat permanent 6-h MCA-O model, Peg3/Pw1 mRNA expression was enhanced in peri-ischemic lesions including caudate putamen, globus pallidus, cingulate cortex, and thalamus. The signals in the contralateral side to ischemia were also observed at high levels in septum, thalamus, hypothalamus, and hippocampus, at moderate levels in neocotex, and at low levels in basal ganglia (globus pallidus, caudate putamen), which is consistent with previous reports that Peg3/Pw1 expression is abundant throughout normal adult mouse and human brain and especially strong in hypothalamus (7Kuroiwa Y. Kaneko-Ishino T. Kagitani F. Kohda T. Li L.L. Tada M. Suzuki R. Yokoyama M. Shiroishi T. Wakana S. Barton S.C. Ishino F. Surani M.A. Nat.

Biol. 1996; 177: 383-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Signals were only observed in sections hybridized with the antisense probe (data not shown). Microautoradiographies show that marked induction of Peg3/Pw1 mRNA signals was observed in the deep peri-ischemic cortex layer (Fig. 2E) and mainly in medium to large-sized cells (about 30–40 μm in diameter) with large nuclei (Fig. 2F), suggesting that this Peg3/Pw1 mRNA expression was enhanced morphologically in typical neuronal cells. These findings indicate that Peg3/Pw1 mRNA is abundant in adult rat brain and that its expression is enhanced in neuronal cells located in peri-ischemic lesions including basal ganglia, thalamus, hypothalamus, and cortex in the rat permanent MCA-O model. Previous studies have shown that p53 protein is enhanced under hypoxic conditions in various types of cells including neuronal cells (21Banasiak K.J. Haddad G.G. Brain Res. 1998; 797: 295-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar) and that Bax gene contains the p53 response element in its promoter region (22Miyashita T. Reed J.C. Cell. 1995; 80: 293-299Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar), and Bax functions in the cell death pathway through activating caspase-3-like activity downstream of p53 in neurons (23Cregan S.P. MacLaurin J.G. Craig C.G. Robertson G.S. Nicholson D.W. Park D.S. Slack R.S. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 7860-7869Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We then examined whether p53 and Bax expressions were enhanced under hypoxic conditions in human neuroblastoma-derived SK-N-SH cells by Western blotting analysis. As shown in Fig. 3A, both p53 and Bax protein expressions were induced 4 h after exposure to hypoxia, and its enhanced expression was sustained until 24 h after exposure to hypoxia in SK-N-SH cells. We performed Western blotting analysis using anti-KDEL antibody to detect both GRP78 (glucose-regulated protein 78) and GRP94 (glucose-regulated protein 94) protein as positive controls, which are reported to be enhanced in various stresses including hypoxia (24Hori O.

We next addressed whether Peg3/Pw1 mRNA expression is induced in SK-N-SH cells under hypoxic conditions and found that Peg3/Pw1 mRNA expression was enhanced in a time-dependent manner by RT-PCR analysis (Fig.3B). In contrast to GRP78 mRNA expression that is enhanced the most at 12 h and reduced at 24 h post-hypoxia, Peg3/Pw1 mRNA expression was enhanced at high levels at 24 h post-hypoxia, when p53 protein expression was also up-regulated at high levels (Fig. 3A). Recently it was reported that Peg3/Pw1 is induced during p53/c-Myc-mediated and p53/EF-1-mediated cell death pathways and plays an important role in making decisions between"

In this study, gel-shift methods are used to measure the effects of a classical agonist dexamethasone and a prototypical antagonist RU486 on thein vitro interactions of GR with DNA substrates, which contain glucocorticoid response elements (GREs) from promoters of GR-regulated genes. These studies show that cell extracts containing human GR bind specifically and with high affinity to GREs in the absence of ligand. An agonist dexamethasone and antagonist RU486 do not affect the affinity of GR for DNA but subtly alter the electrophoretic mobility of the GR-DNA complex. Importantly, the dissociation rate of GR from DNA increases as a function of the concentration of GRE-containing DNA. At a fixed DNA concentration, dexamethasone-bound GR dissociates from DNA significantly faster than does ligand-free GR or RU486-bound GR.

GR is predominantly cytosolic and requires association with heat shock proteins for ligand binding, a feature that has complicated in vitro structural studies of GR (1Scherrer L.C. Dalman F.C.

The molecular mechanism by which hormones and small molecule ligands regulate GR-mediated gene expression is not clearly understood. A favored model is that hormone binding induces dissociation of heat shock proteins from the ligand-bound GR complex, which then translocates to the nucleus for sequence-specific DNA binding to GREs (7Scherrer L.C. Picard D. Massa E. Harmon J.M. Simons Jr., S.S. Yamamoto K.R. Pratt W.B. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 5381-5386Google Scholar, 8Picard D. Khursheed B. Garabedian M.J. Fortin M.G. Lindquist S.

Biol. 1992; 41: 715-718Google Scholar). However, the underlying mechanism for the expression of agonist versus antagonist activity for the steroid-bound GR-DNA complex is not clear. Attempts to study the allosteric effects of hormones on GR-DNA interactions in vitro have led to contradictory observations. In general, studies indicate that hormones are not required for stable GR binding to DNA in vitro (11Rusconi S. Yamamoto K.R. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 1309-1315Google Scholar, 12Aumais J.P. Lee H.S.

Groyer A. Idziorek T. Mariller M. Baulieu E.E. J. Steroid Biochem. 1988; 30: 291-294Google Scholar). Specifically, complexes of agonist triamcinolone acetonide and antagonist RU486 bound to GR have a comparable affinity for glucocorticoid response elements from different promoters (14Rajpert E.J. Lemaigre F.P. Eliard P.H. Place M. Lafontaine D.A. Economidis I.V. Belayew A. Martial J.A. Rousseau G.G. J. Steroid Biochem. 1987; 26: 513-520Google Scholar, 15Groyer A. Schweizer-Groyer G.

Steroid Biochem. 1988; 30: 291-294Google Scholar). In contrast to these studies done on asymmetric GR binding sites, gel-shift experiments reported with GR and an artificial palindromic GRE suggest that ligands directly affect GR-DNA binding (17Heck S. Kullmann M. Gast A. Ponta H. Rahmsdorf H.J. Herrlich P. Cato A.C. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4087-4095Google Scholar). The agonist dexamethasone enhances GR-DNA binding severalfold, whereas antagonists including RU486 have no effect on GR-DNA binding. However, this observation is contested by a report that also implements gel-shift methods with a palindromic GRE substrate but uses in vitro transcribed GR (13Guido E.C. Delorme E.O. Clemm D.L. Stein R.B. Rosen J. Miner J.N. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 1178-1190Google Scholar). This work shows that dexamethasone and RU486 predominantly affect the mobility of GR-DNA complex in a gel and only modestly affect the affinity of GR for DNA (13Guido E.C. Delorme E.O. Clemm D.L. Stein R.B. Rosen J. Miner J.N. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 1178-1190Google Scholar). Therefore, although ligands clearly regulate GR-mediated transcriptional activity, a direct effect of these ligands on specific GR-DNA interactions is controversial. In vivo, several lines of evidence suggest that GR-binding ligands have an indirect effect on chromatin accessibility and structure by the recruitment of specific co-activators and DNA remodeling factors to transcriptional complexes (18Bourguet W. Germain P. Gronemeyer H. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2000; 21: 381-388Google Scholar, 19Xu L. Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1999; 9: 140-147Google Scholar). Several co-activator proteins including CBP, SRC1, and GRIP bind GR in the presence of hormone. These proteins have histone acetyl transferase activity that weakens histone-chromatin interactions and makes chromatin more accessible and amenable to transcription (20Spencer T.E. Jenster G. Burcin M.M. Allis C.D. Zhou J. Mizzen C.A. McKenna N.J. Onate S.A. Tsai S.Y. Tsai M.J. O'Malley B.W. Nature. 1997; 389: 194-198Google Scholar, 21Hassig C.A. Schreiber S.L. Curr. Opin. Chem.

Grable P.G. Ayer D.E. Schreiber S.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 3519-3524Google Scholar). In comparison, remodeling proteins (including the Swi/Snf factors that interact with GR) can directly alter the structure and flexibility of chromatin to promote transcription (24Fryer C.J. Archer T.K. Nature. 1998; 393: 88-91Google Scholar, 25Muchardt C. Yaniv M. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 4279-4290Google Scholar, 26Yoshinaga S.K. Peterson C.L. Herskowitz I. Yamamoto K.R. Science. 1992; 258: 1598-1604Google Scholar). Furthermore, chemical footprinting studies suggest that hormone-bound GR transiently binds to its response elements and then leaves its site accessible to other factors including NF1 (27Truss M. Bartsch J. Schelbert A. Hache R.J. Beato M. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1737-1751Google Scholar) and HNF5 (28Rigaud G. Roux J. Pictet R. Grange T. Cell. 1991; 67: 977-986Google Scholar). A model that describes a dynamic transcriptional complex is also supported by recent photobleaching experiments carried out on GR-bound mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV) chromatin in living cells (29McNally J.G. Muller W.G. Walker D. Wolford R. Hager G.L. Science. 2000; 287: 1262-1265Google Scholar). These studies show that the GR-DNA complex in the presence of cortisol has a short half-life, on the order of seconds, with cortisol-bound GR dissociating and associating rapidly with chromatin. Footprinting and photobleaching experiments contradict the traditional view that receptors remain bound to DNA sites in the presence of ligands. All of these studies allude to a “hit and run” mechanism of transactivation whereby the hormone-bound receptor is in fast exchange with its chromatin regulatory elements (29McNally J.G. Muller W.G. Walker D. Wolford R. Hager G.L. Science. 2000; 287: 1262-1265Google Scholar, 30Hager G.L. Fragoso G. Methods Enzymol. 1999; 304: 626-638Google Scholar, 31Hager G.L. Fletcher T.M. Xiao N. Baumann C.T. Muller W.G. McNally J.G. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2000; 28: 405-410Google Scholar). The studies that allude to this mechanism all are carried out with agonist-bound GR; however, the results of a comparison of the effects of antagonistversus agonist or no ligand on the kinetics of GR-DNA interactions are not known. In vivo, GR-DNA interactions in the absence of ligand are not readily measured, because cellular GR is predominantly cytosolic in the absence of hormone. However in vitro dissociation kinetic studies, using gel-electrophoretic methods on the DNA binding domain of GR with its response elements, show that dissociation is dependent on DNA concentration (32Lieberman B.A. Nordeen S.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1061-1068Google Scholar). These studies predict that at concentrations of DNA present in the nucleus, GR is in fast dissociation with DNA; however, the question of how ligands affect GR-DNA dissociation kinetics remains unanswered. This work explores the effects of functional ligands on GR-DNA interactions with respect to binding affinity and dissociation kineticsin vitro by gel-shift methods. We investigate in detail the effects of dexamethasone, a potent and classical GR agonist, and RU486, a prototypical GR antagonist, on the affinity and dissociation kinetics of the GR-DNA complex. We observe that these ligands do not alter the highly cooperative binding affinity of GR for asymmetric and palindromic DNA response elements. Moreover, the dissociation of full-length receptor from DNA is directly proportional to the square of the concentration of GRE-containing DNA. Although an agonist like dexamethasone enhances GR-DNA dissociation by 10-fold compared with steroid-free receptor, an antagonist like RU486 has a modest depreciation on GR-DNA kinetics. These observations are discussed with respect to the implications on transcriptional activation and ligand-mediated receptor-DNA search mechanisms. All tissue culture flasks were obtained from Falcon, and all chemicals were obtained from Sigma unless otherwise specified. Radiolabeled [3H]dexamethasone (35 Ci/mmol) and [γ-33P]ATP were obtained from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. COS-7 cells were obtained from ATCC (CRL-1651). Culture media and sera were products of Life Technologies, Inc. unless otherwise stated. The fetal bovine serum was from Gemini Bio-Products (Calabasas, CA). The following oligonucleotides containing a single GRE, purified by PAGE, were obtained from Invitrogen: GRE1-TOP, 5′-GCAGGTCTTTATGGTTACAAACTGTTCTTAAAACAAGG-3′; GRE1-BOT, 5′-ATCCTTGTTTTAAGAACAGTTTGTAACCATAAAGACCT-3′; GRE2-TOP, 5′-GCAGGTCCTCTGCTGTACAGGATGTTCTAGCTACAAGG-3′; GRE2-BOT, 5′-ATCCTTGTAGCTAGAACATCCTGTACAGCAGAGGACCT-3′; GRE3-TOP, 5′-GCAGGTCCTCTGCAGAACACAGTGTTCTAGCTACAAGG-3′; GRE3-BOT, 5′-ATCCTTGTAGCTAGAACACTGTGTTCTGCAGAGGACCT-3′; GRE4-TOP, 5′-AGCTTAGAACACAGTGTTCTCTAGAG-3′; GRE4-BOT, 5′-GATCCTCTAGAGAACACTGTGTTCTA-3′. The top and bottom strands of each pair of dimeric GRE-containing oligonucleotides were labeled with a TOP and BOT suffix. The consensus nonpalindromic dimeric GRE1 and GRE2 substrates were from the MMTV and the tyrosine aminotransferase (TAT) promoters, respectively. The center of oligonucleotides GRE3-TOP and GRE3-BOT contained a palindromic GRE sequence reported to bind GR with high affinity (12Aumais J.P. Lee H.S. DeGannes C. Horsford J. White J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12568-12577Google Scholar). Oligonucleotides GRE4-TOP and GRE4-BOT contained a palindromic GRE designed at the end of the sequence identical to that used in a reported GR-DNA binding gel-shift study (17Heck S. Kullmann M. Gast A. Ponta H. Rahmsdorf H.J. Herrlich P. Cato A.C. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4087-4095Google Scholar). All transfection reagents were purchased from Invitrogen unless specified. A plasmid containing the coding sequence of the human GRα gene (flanked by BamHI and XhoI restriction sites) was obtained from ATCC (pRShGR, 67200). To generate efficient expression plasmids, the 5′-untranslated region of the human GRα cDNA in pRShGR was removed. The entire GR coding fragment was reassembled in a baculovirus transfer vector, pFastBac (Invitrogen), by ligating the BamHI/EcoRI fragment of the PCR product and the EcoRI/XhoI fragment of pRShGR into BamHI/XhoI-digested pFastBac. The complete GR coding fragment was also subcloned into the mammalian cell transfection vector pcDNA3.1(+) to generate the hGRpcDNA3.1 vector, which was used for transient transfection into COS-7 cells. COS-7 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 10% fetal bovine serum, and 1% penicillin/streptomycin in a 37 °C, 5% CO2 incubator and split every 3–4 days. Cells were plated in 75-cm2 tissue culture flasks or in poly(d-lysine)-coated 6-well plates until they were ∼80% confluent for transfection. Cells were transiently transfected with the hGRpcDNA3.1 vector using LipofectAMINE-2000 according to the manufacturer's protocol. After 24 h of transfection, a ligand (dexamethasone or RU486) was added to each well at a final concentration of 100 nm and further incubated for 24 h followed by the addition of enzyme-free dissociation solution, Hanks' based, (Specialty Media, Lavellette, NJ) to detach the cells. The cells were transferred to a tube, centrifuged at 2000 rpm, and washed with cold phosphate-buffered saline. The cell pellets were lysed in the presence of low salt buffer A (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 10 mm NaMoO4, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA, and a 1:100 dilution of protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma)) by three cycles of freezing and thawing. Cell lysates prepared with a high salt buffer B (Buffer A and 500 mm NaCl) or low salt buffer A yielded similar concentrations of active GR. However, high salt extracts contained other contaminating nuclear components as well, which bind nonspecifically to GRE-containing DNA (as shown in gel-shift experiments); therefore, we chose to use low salt buffer A to prepare GR extracts for these studies. To prevent dissociation of ligand from the receptor, ligand (at a final concentration of 100 nm) was included in the lysis buffer for those cells that were pretreated with ligand. The lysate was spun down at 14,000 rpm for 30 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant collected as the whole cell extract. For EMSA experiments, 0.1 nmol of oligonucleotides GRE1-TOP, GRE2-TOP, GRE3-TOP, and GRE4-TOP were end-labeled with 2 μl of [γ-33P]ATP using T4-polynucleotide kinase (Invitrogen) in a 20-μl reaction. The labeled oligonucleotides were purified to remove unincorporated labels using a Qiaquick nucleotide removal kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). To form duplexes, 0.07 nmol of each labeled oligonucleotide (top strand) was mixed with 0.07 nmol of the complementary oligonucleotide (bottom strand) in 100 μl of TE buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl and 1 mm EDTA). The hybridization mixture was heated in a water bath to boiling temperature and was then slow cooled to room temperature. The efficiency of duplex formation was checked by PAGE on a 15% gel. For binding reactions, whole cell extract (containing ∼1 nm active GR, as measured by [3H]dexamethasone binding, Ref. 33Santoro J.C. Harris G. Sitlani A. Anal. Biochem. 2001; 289: 18-25Google Scholar) was incubated with 5 nm labeled GRE duplex in a buffer containing 40 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.5), 0.2 mm EDTA, 8 mm dithiothreitol, 80 mm NaCl, 0.1% bovine serum albumin, 20% glycerol, 0.25% Nonidet P-40, and 12–25 μg of poly(dI-dC). For the comparison of DNA binding by GR, GR-Dex, and GR-RU486 extracts, the amount of extract and protein used in each lane was normalized by measuring the total protein concentration in each extract by a Coomassie Plus protein assay reagent kit (Pierce, Rockford, IL). Each binding reaction mixture (containing increasing concentrations of GR extract) was incubated at 25 °C for 1 h, 45 min until equilibrium was attained. A small aliquot (2–4 μl) of the reaction mixture was loaded onto a 5% gel (75:1 acrylamide/bis-acrylamide) and run at 100 V in 50 mm Tris borate, 1 mm EDTA buffer. The samples were added while the gel was running to avoid precipitation of the protein-DNA complexes in the gel wells. For the dissociation reactions, excess unlabeled duplex GRE (prepared by hybridizing unlabeled top and bottom strands according to the protocol described above) was added to the binding reactions that had reached equilibrium. Following the addition of an excess duplex competitor, reaction aliquots (3.0 μl) were loaded at different time points (1, 2.5, 5, 7.5, 15, 20, 30, 45, and 60 min) onto a gel run at 100 V. The gels were run for 1 h and dried on a Slab gel-dryer (Forma Scientific). Dried gels were quantitated by a STORM PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA), and data were plotted and analyzed using PRISM software (GraphPad, CA). The percentage of bound GR-DNA was plotted as a function of log[GR], and the data fit to a sigmoidal dose-response curve to extract the concentration at half-maximal binding (EC50). Dissociation data were plotted as a function of time (t, s), and the data fit to the first order kinetic equation, [GR­DNA complex]/[GR­DNA complex]t=0=Ae−kdt+BEquation 1 in which the specific [GR-DNA complex] counts were normalized for the total counts in each lane to account for variations in gel loading, and A and B were constants. The fit was used to extract the dissociation constant (kd) and half-life (t1/2 = 0.69/kd) at each condition. Each dissociation curve was fit to data obtained from at least three independent experiments, and the error was represented as standard deviations. Kinetic experiments were carried out at varying duplex substrate concentrations (625–3750 nm), and thekd values were obtained for each concentration of duplex used. Gel mobility shift methods were used to measure and compare the thermodynamic parameters of the GR-DNA, Dex-GR-DNA, and RU486-GR-DNA complexes prepared in vitro. Gel-shift experiments are conducted with unpurified cell extracts of GR prepared by transfecting COS-7 cells with a GR expression vector, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Cell extracts of GR prepared in the absence of ligand bind with high affinity and specificity to a duplex (GRE1) containing a dimeric GRE site from the MMTV promoter (Fig. 1). Importantly, the specific GR-DNA band shift (Fig. 1) can be competed with unlabeled duplex GRE1 substrate but not with sequence-scrambled duplex DNA, confirming a specific interaction with the GRE site. In addition, extracts prepared from cells transfected with a vector not containing the GR coding sequence do not show a specific GR-DNA band (data not shown), indicating that the specific gel-shifts identified in Figs. 1and 3 are GR-dependent. Interestingly, extracts of ligand-free GR bind with similar affinity to nonpalindromic GREs from the TAT and MMTV (GRE1 and GRE2) promoters as well as with a palindromic sequence contained in the center of the duplex GRE3 (Fig.1A). However, no stable GR-DNA band shift is observed with the GRE4 substrate that contains a palindromic GRE sequence at the end of the duplex (Fig. 1A). This observation points to the importance of nonspecific flanking sequences in stabilizing GR-DNA binding.Figure 3Effect of ligands dexamethasone and RU486 on GR-DNA dissociation.A and B, gel-shifts showing dissociation of GR-RU486 (A) and GR-Dex (B) from MMTV DNA at 1250 nm excess unlabeled MMTV DNA. The lane marked 20* represents a control lane with DNA minus GR extract loaded at the 20-min time point. C, analyses of the gel dissociation data in A and B by single exponential decay curves demonstrate that dissociation of GR-Dex (t1/2 = 220 s; kd = 2.9 × 10−3 s−1) is significantly faster than GR-RU486 (t1/2 = 5600 s; kd = 1.2 × 10−4 s−1) from DNA.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Cell extracts of GR prepared with agonist dexamethasone or antagonist RU486 bind GRE1 (containing the MMTV site) with similar affinity as ligand-free GR (Fig. 1, B and C). Interestingly, the binding of all three extracts to the dimeric MMTV-DNA is highly cooperative as a function of GR concentration (Fig. 1C). Similarly, studies carried out with the DNA binding domain of GR (dbd-GR) indicate cooperativeness in DNA binding, suggesting that the first monomer molecule of dbd-GR to DNA may significantly enhance binding of the second monomer. Although others have reported a specific monomer dbd-GR-DNA band in gel-shift studies, we detect no complex containing monomer full-length GR bound to DNA by gel-shift analyses (32Lieberman B.A. Nordeen S.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1061-1068Google Scholar, 34Dahlman-Wright K. Wright A. Gustafsson J.A. Carlstedt-Duke J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 3107-3112Google Scholar, 35Dahlman-Wright K. Wright A.P.

Biol. 1993; 45: 239-250Google Scholar). Moreover, experiments carried out with cell extracts of GR and a duplex containing a single MMTV half-site indicate no stable and specific GR-DNA band shift (data not shown). The cooperative binding data for dimeric GR bound to DNA (Fig. 1C) yields half-maximal concentrations or EC50 values, which are estimations of the dissociation constants (Kd) of all three extracts ranging from 1.8 × 10−9m (for both GR-Dex and GR-RU486) to 2.0 × 10−9m (for GR). As demonstrated by these studies, ligands dexamethasone or RU486 do not significantly alter the affinity of GR for MMTV DNA (Fig. 1), a result also observed with duplexes GRE2 and GRE3, which contain GREs from other gene promoters, suggesting a more universal effect. However, Dex-GR extracts induce subtle effects on the mobility of the GR-DNA band containing the MMTV (GRE1) substrate (Fig. 1B). The Dex-GR-DNA gel-shift band appears as a sharper doublet suggesting that this complex has a conformation that is distinct from the GR-DNA and RU486-GR-DNA complexes (Figs. 1B and 3B). Given the lack of effect of ligand on the affinity of GR for GRE-containing DNA substrates, attention is shifted to investigate a potential ligand-dependent effect on the rate of association or dissociation of GR from DNA. The cooperative binding data indicate that the association rate for dimer GR binding to DNA is likely dependent on the binding of monomer GR to DNA; however, we detect no stable monomer GR-DNA band in our gel-shift studies (Fig.1). Instead, in our attempts to measure association kinetics we detect transient intermediates that migrate with gel mobilities similar to the stable GR-DNA band and that associate and dissociate too fast to measure by gel-shift methods (data not shown). Moreover, association of the stable dimer Dex-GR-DNA complex is significantly faster than the GR-DNA and RU486-GR-DNA complexes. Because direct measurement and comparison of the association kinetics for the GR-DNA, Dex-GR-DNA, and RU486-GR-DNA are not feasible, we focus our attention on measuring the dissociation kinetics of these complexes. Studies were conducted to characterize the dissociation of dimeric GR from DNA containing the MMTV GRE (duplex GRE1). Gel-shift experiments indicate that the half-life (dissociation kinetics) of the GR-DNA complex is not a simple first order reaction but is dependent on the concentration of GRE-containing duplex DNA. An increase in the concentration of unlabeled GRE1 from 625 to 3800 nmpromotes a nonlinear increase in the dissociation kinetics of GR (Fig.2). However, an increase in the concentration of nonspecific DNA (containing no GREs) in the reaction does not have a measurable effect on the dissociation kinetics of the GR-DNA complex (data not shown). Dissociation data are fit to a simple exponential decay curve to extract the half-life (t1/2) and dissociation constants (kd) of the GR-DNA complex at each GRE1 DNA concentration. The dissociation constant (kd) increases linearly with the square of duplex DNA concentration (Fig. 2B), indicating that GR-GRE dissociation is second order in excess GRE-containing DNA. The limiting dissociation rate (k0 = 0.98 × 10−4 s−1) is obtained by extrapolating the plot of kdversus[DNA]2 to [DNA]2 = 0 (Fig. 2B). Further validation of second order dissociation kinetics is demonstrated in a linear regression plot of ln(kd − k0)versus ln[DNA], which has a slope of 2.3. A similar second order dependence on DNA concentration is observed withsf9 cell extracts of GR, obtained from baculoviral infection of recombinant human GR (data not shown). Agonist dexamethasone and antagonist RU486 have opposite effects on GR-DNA dissociation kinetics (Fig. 3and Table I). At a GRE1 duplex concentration of 1.25 μm, the Dex-GR-DNA complex exhibits faster dissociation kinetics (t1/2 = 220 s;kd = 2.9 × 10−3s−1) whereas the RU486-GR-DNA complex shows modestly slower dissociation kinetics (t1/2 = 5600 s;kd = 1.2 × 10−4s−1) than the unliganded GR-DNA complex (t1/2= 2300 s; kd = 3.0 × 10−4 s−1). Importantly, dissociation kinetics of the Dex-GR-DNA varies as a nonlinear function of duplex DNA concentration. The dependence of kd for the Dex-GR-DNA complex on duplex GRE1 concentration is analogous to the GR-DNA complex. A 2-fold increase in the DNA concentration promotes a 4-fold increase in kd for both the Dex-GR-DNA and the GR-DNA complex (Table I). For the comparison of DNA dissociation, extracts of GR, GR-Dex, and GR-RU486 all show ∼20–50% DNA binding at the initial time point prior to addition of excess GRE. In this range, the dissociation rates are independent of the fraction of DNA bound.Table IDissociation kinetics of GR, GR-Dex, GR-RU486 MMTV DNA: comparison of DNA concentration dependenceHalf-life, t1/2 (s)1-aDoubling the concentration of DNA causes a 4–5 fold decrease in t1/2 for both the unliganded GR-DNA and Dex-GR-DNA complexes.

Open table in a new tab The mechanism by which ligands modulate GR-dependent transcriptional regulation is complex; several laboratories are currently investigating this problem from different perspectives and using distinct methodologies. One piece of this puzzle is the question of whether or not ligands modulate the interactions between GR and specific DNA recognition sites. Methods including gel-shifts, gradient sedimentation, and footprinting have been used to measure the allosteric effects of ligands on the interactions between GR and DNAin vitro; however, these studies have led to contradictory results (12Aumais J.P.

We report the structural and functional characterization of CDT6. We demonstrate that CDT6 is a secreted protein that folds into disulfide-linked homotetramers by coiled-coil interactions. The finding that CDT6 is expressed at high levels in the avascular corneal stromal layer suggested that the protein, similar to certain angiopoietins, acts as a negative regulator of angiogenesis. To test this hypothesis and to assay the effect of the protein on a growing tissue with high vascular density, CDT6 was expressed in a mouse xenograft model. Expression of CDT6 led to a reduction in tumor growth and aberrant blood vessel formation by inducing massive fibrosis. Interestingly, expression of CDT6 also resulted in the deposition of extracellular matrix components typical for the mature corneal stromal layer.

Three separated cellular components can be distinguished as follows: the epithelium, the stroma, and the endothelium. The epithelium consists of several cell layers that are constantly replaced by proliferation and differentiation of the corneal limbal stem cells. The stromal layer constitutes about 90% of corneal thickness and is produced by the embedded fibroblast-like keratocytes. This layer consists of a highly specialized extracellular matrix largely composed of specific collagen fibrils surrounded by proteoglycans to produce a strong and transparent lattice. The inner cellular layer, the endothelium, consists of a single layer of hexagonal cells and regulates corneal osmotic balance (1Klyce S.D. Beuerman R.W. Kaufmann H.E. Barron B.A. McDonald M.B. Waltman S.R. The Cornea. Churchill Livingstone, New York1988: 3-54Google Scholar). As the unique properties of the human cornea are likely to be reflected in the gene expression pattern of this tissue, several studies have been focused on the characterization of gene products contributing to corneal development and integrity (2Fujimaki T.

Data base similarity searches revealed that CDT6 is homologous to the gene family of the angiopoietins. These glycoproteins signal vascular morphogenesis and maintenance by binding to the vascular endothelial Tie2 receptor (5Davis S. Aldrich T.H. Jones P.F. Acheson A. Compton D.L. Jain V. Ryan T.E.

Angiopoietins are characterized by three domains as follows: a signal sequence for protein secretion, a coiled-coil domain that mediates multimerization, and a fibrinogen-like domain that binds the Tie2 receptor. Although CDT6 shares all these features with the angiopoietins, it does not bind the Tie2 receptor. This indicated that CDT6 does not function as a “true” angiopoietin (7Valenzuela D.M. Griffiths J.A. Rojas J. Aldrich T.H. Jones P.F. Zhou H. McClain J. Copeland N.G. Gilbert D.J. Jenkins N.A. Huang T. Papadopoulos N. Maisonpierre P.C. Davis S. Yancopoulos G.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

However, the finding that CDT6 is expressed in a tissue, which is normally devoid of blood vessels, suggested that the protein, similar to angiopoietin-1 and angiopoietin-2, acts as a negative regulator of angiogenesis. This suggestion is supported by the finding that expression of CDT6 is restricted to the corneal stromal layer, the site of pathologic angiogenesis.In this report we describe the structural and functional characterization of CDT6.

As angiopoietin-like proteins, like angiopoietins, effect angiogenesis, they must use different mechanisms of signal transduction. In this report, we describe the structural and functional characterization of the human corneal angiopoietin-like factor CDT6. We found that CDT6 is produced as a secreted protein with an apparent molecular mass of 45 kDa. The fact that the molecular mass of CDT6 was larger than the expected molecular mass of 38 kDa, as calculated from its amino acid sequence, indicates post-translational modification of the protein. Consistent with this observation, the open reading frame of CDT6 contains several potential N-glycosylation sites (4Peek R. van Gelderen B.E. Bruinenberg M. Kijlstra A. Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 1998; 39: 1782-1788PubMed Google Scholar). This suggests that CDT6, similar to the angiopoietins, is produced as a glycoprotein.In angiopoietins, the coiled-coil domain mediates the formation of homo-oligomers that are stabilized by interchain disulfide bridges (7Valenzuela D.M. Griffiths J.A. Rojas J. Aldrich T.H. Jones P.F. Zhou H. McClain J. Copeland N.G. Gilbert D.J. Jenkins N.A. Huang T. Papadopoulos N. Maisonpierre P.C. Davis S. Yancopoulos G.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

This is thought to be required for the interaction of angiopoietins with the Tie2 receptor and thus might be crucial for ligand-mediated activity of the Tie receptor. By using CD spectroscopy and analytical centrifugation, we demonstrated that the predicted coiled-coil segment of CDT6 folds into a tetrameric coiled-coil structure in vitro. Consistent with these findings, CDT6 in vivo exists predominantly as disulfide-linked homotrimers and homotetramers. The intermolecular disulfide bridges are most likely formed by cysteine residues that flank the coiled-coil domain. These findings suggest that clustering of the fibrinogen-like domains of CDT6 might be required for the interaction of the protein with a yet unknown receptor on the cell surface.By expressing CDT6 in a human xenograft model, we demonstrated that this protein has a dramatic effect on a growing tissue with a high vascular density. Interestingly, in xenografts with the highest expression of CDT6, tumor volume was reduced up to 6-fold 4 weeks after inoculation. As these tumors require a dense vascular network for rapid growth the expression of CDT6, similar to that of angiopoietins, might interfere with angiogenesis resulting in a suppression of tumor growth. Consistent with this assumption, immunohistochemical analysis of tissue sections of CDT6 expressing xenografts stained for blood vessel endothelial cells indeed showed aberrant blood vessels. The blood vessel diameter and lumen was significantly increased as determined by automated image analysis (12Van der Laak J.A. Westphal J.R. Schalkwijk L.J. Pahlplatz M.M. Ruiter D.J. de Waal R.M. de Wilde P.C. J. Pathol. 1998; 184: 136-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). From these results we initially assumed that similar to angiopoietin-1 and angiopoietin-2, CDT6 was involved in vascular morphogenesis. However, not only blood vessel endothelial cells but also the tumor cells themselves appeared to be affected in their morphology by expressing CDT6. Whereas the cells in control tumors were spaced in a relatively ordered fashion, in the CDT6 tumors cells were more elongated and appeared to align to higher order structures.In theory, the observed increase in extracellular matrix components might also be accounted for by a CDT6-induced fibrotic response of host (mouse) cells such as fibroblasts as a defense against the invading tumor cells. For several reasons, however, we think that the extracellular matrix production is tumor cell-derived rather than host cell-derived. First, fibrotic tissue consists mainly of fibronectin, laminin, and collagen types I, III, and IV (23Paczek L. Bartlomiejczyk I. Gradowska L. Szmidt J. Rowinski W. Gaciong Z. Heidland A. Laskowska-Klita T. Ann. Transplant. 1996; 1: 41-43PubMed Google Scholar, 24Magro G. Fraggetta M.G. Travalis S. Lanzafame S. Gen. Diagn.

Tissue Res. 1989; 23: 19-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Collagen type V was hardly ever observed in fibrotic tissue (27Madri J.A. Furthmayr H. Hum. Pathol. 1980; 11: 353-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar, 28Vleming L.J. Baelde J.J. Westendorp R.G. Daha M.R. van Es L.A. Bruijn J.A. Clin. Nephrol. 1995; 44: 211-219PubMed Google Scholar), whereas we found an abundant increase in expression of collagen V in CDT6-expressing tumors. In contrast, an increase in expression of fibronectin, collagen IV, and laminin was not observed (Fig. 5). Second, staining for extracellular matrix components in general (Azan and Alcian blue, Fig.5) showed individual tumor cells surrounded by large amounts of ECM. This strongly suggests that the CDT6-expressing tumor cells, rather than host cells (endothelial cells and fibroblasts), produce the large amount of ECM. Finally, staining for collagen types I and V on cultured control and CDT6 transfected tumor cells showed an increased expression of these collagen types by CDT6 transfectants.In addition to the CDT6-expressing tumor cells it appeared also that the blood vessel endothelial cells contributed to the increase in the extracellular matrix components, as evidenced by microscopic analyses. Increased deposition of these extracellular matrix components results not only in aberrant tumor morphology but is probably also responsible for the abnormal morphology seen for the blood vessels. As angiogenesis involves breakdown of the extracellular matrix before endothelial cells can migrate, the dense and more rigid extracellular matrix of CDT6 tumors might partially block this process leading to abnormally formed blood vessels. Possibly these abnormal blood vessels do not supply the surrounding tumor tissue with oxygen and nutrients as efficient as in controls resulting in impaired tumor growth. Alternatively, the extracellular matrix in CDT6 tumors might allow diffusion of nutrients less efficiently also leading to a reduction in tumor growth.The CDT6-induced drastic increase in the production of distinct extracellular matrix components indicates that this protein has an important function in the human cornea. With its characteristic uniform diameter of striated collagen fibrils in the stromal layer, the cornea has the highest collagen V content of all human tissues and contains up to 5-fold more type V collagen than those of tendon and sclera. The interaction between type I and type V collagen regulates fibril diameter, whereas the interactions between collagens and proteoglycans define the spacing of these fibrils. Both processes are thought to be crucial for optical transparency (29McLaughlin J.S. Linsenmayer T.F. Birk D.E. J. Cell Sci. 1989; 94: 371-379PubMed Google Scholar, 30Birk D.E. Fitch J.M. Babiarz J.P. Doane K.J. Linsenmayer T.F. J. Cell Sci. 1990; 95: 649-657Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 31Scott J.E. J. Anat. 1992; 180: 155-164PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, the increased production of collagen I and V and proteoglycans but not other extracellular matrix components in CDT6-expressing tumors mimics the natural situation in the cornea stromal layer. Consistent with this notion, tissue sections of these tumors resemble highly disorganized stromal layers in which the tumor cells are stretched in a similar manner as the cornea stromal keratocytes. These observations suggest that CDT6 functions as a morphogen, which induces differentiation toward a corneal keratocyte phenotype. CDT6 may exert this function on corneal keratocytes in vivo through an autocrine mechanism to compensate for loss of extracellular matrix components by protein turnover and to restore corneal integrity in case of tissue damage.Recently, CDT6 was independently cloned from human ovary (7Valenzuela D.M. Griffiths J.A. Rojas J. Aldrich T.H. Jones P.F. Zhou H. McClain J. Copeland N.G. Gilbert D.J. Jenkins N.A. Huang T. Papadopoulos N. Maisonpierre P.C. Davis S. Yancopoulos G.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 1904-1909Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar). Together with our xenograft results, these findings indicate that the receptor for CDT6 is not cell type-specific. The fact that we were not able to demonstrate significant CDT6 expression in other human tissues (4Peek R. van Gelderen B.E. Bruinenberg M. Kijlstra A. Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 1998; 39: 1782-1788PubMed Google Scholar) suggests that high level expression of CDT6 is restricted to the cornea stromal layer. This assumption is consistent with our findings that high level expression of CDT6 had a much stronger impact on tumor morphology than low level expression. However, the observation that CDT6 is also expressed in other tissues suggests additional possible functions for this protein. The human cornea possesses several unique characteristics such as resistance to neoplasia, light refraction, optical transparency, and avascularity. Three separated cellular components can be distinguished as follows: the epithelium, the stroma, and the endothelium. The epithelium consists of several cell layers that are constantly replaced by proliferation and differentiation of the corneal limbal stem cells. The stromal layer constitutes about 90% of corneal thickness and is produced by the embedded fibroblast-like keratocytes.

First, fibrotic tissue consists mainly of fibronectin, laminin, and collagen types I, III, and IV (23Paczek L. Bartlomiejczyk I. Gradowska L. Szmidt J. Rowinski W. Gaciong Z. Heidland A. Laskowska-Klita T. Ann. Transplant. 1996; 1: 41-43PubMed Google Scholar, 24Magro G. Fraggetta M.G. Travalis S. Lanzafame S. Gen. Diagn.

Tissue Res. 1989; 23: 19-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Collagen type V was hardly ever observed in fibrotic tissue (27Madri J.A. Furthmayr H. Hum. Pathol. 1980; 11: 353-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar, 28Vleming L.J. Baelde J.J. Westendorp R.G. Daha M.R. van Es L.A. Bruijn J.A. Clin. Nephrol. 1995; 44: 211-219PubMed Google Scholar), whereas we found an abundant increase in expression of collagen V in CDT6-expressing tumors. In contrast, an increase in expression of fibronectin, collagen IV, and laminin was not observed (Fig. 5). Second, staining for extracellular matrix components in general (Azan and Alcian blue, Fig.5) showed individual tumor cells surrounded by large amounts of ECM. This strongly suggests that the CDT6-expressing tumor cells, rather than host cells (endothelial cells and fibroblasts), produce the large amount of ECM. Finally, staining for collagen types I and V on cultured control and CDT6 transfected tumor cells showed an increased expression of these collagen types by CDT6 transfectants.In addition to the CDT6-expressing tumor cells it appeared also that the blood vessel endothelial cells contributed to the increase in the extracellular matrix components, as evidenced by microscopic analyses. Increased deposition of these extracellular matrix components results not only in aberrant tumor morphology but is probably also responsible for the abnormal morphology seen for the blood vessels. As angiogenesis involves breakdown of the extracellular matrix before endothelial cells can migrate, the dense and more rigid extracellular matrix of CDT6 tumors might partially block this process leading to abnormally formed blood vessels. Possibly these abnormal blood vessels do not supply the surrounding tumor tissue with oxygen and nutrients as efficient as in controls resulting in impaired tumor growth. Alternatively, the extracellular matrix in CDT6 tumors might allow diffusion of nutrients less efficiently also leading to a reduction in tumor growth.The CDT6-induced drastic increase in the production of distinct extracellular matrix components indicates that this protein has an important function in the human cornea. With its characteristic uniform diameter of striated collagen fibrils in the stromal layer, the cornea has the highest collagen V content of all human tissues and contains up to 5-fold more type V collagen than those of tendon and sclera. The interaction between type I and type V collagen regulates fibril diameter, whereas the interactions between collagens and proteoglycans define the spacing of these fibrils. Both processes are thought to be crucial for optical transparency (29McLaughlin J.S. Linsenmayer T.F. Birk D.E. J. Cell Sci. 1989; 94: 371-379PubMed Google Scholar, 30Birk D.E. Fitch J.M.

Thus, the increased production of collagen I and V and proteoglycans but not other extracellular matrix components in CDT6-expressing tumors mimics the natural situation in the cornea stromal layer. Consistent with this notion, tissue sections of these tumors resemble highly disorganized stromal layers in which the tumor cells are stretched in a similar manner as the cornea stromal keratocytes. These observations suggest that CDT6 functions as a morphogen, which induces differentiation toward a corneal keratocyte phenotype. CDT6 may exert this function on corneal keratocytes in vivo through an autocrine mechanism to compensate for loss of extracellular matrix components by protein turnover and to restore corneal integrity in case of tissue damage.Recently, CDT6 was independently cloned from human ovary (7Valenzuela D.M. Griffiths J.A. Rojas J. Aldrich T.H. Jones P.F. Zhou H. McClain J. Copeland N.G. Gilbert D.J. Jenkins N.A. Huang T. Papadopoulos N. Maisonpierre P.C. Davis S. Yancopoulos G.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 1904-1909Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar). Together with our xenograft results, these findings indicate that the receptor for CDT6 is not cell type-specific. The fact that we were not able to demonstrate significant CDT6 expression in other human tissues (4Peek R. van Gelderen B.E. Bruinenberg M. Kijlstra A. Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 1998; 39: 1782-1788PubMed Google Scholar) suggests that high level expression of CDT6 is restricted to the cornea stromal layer. This assumption is consistent with our findings that high level expression of CDT6 had a much stronger impact on tumor morphology than low level expression. However, the observation that CDT6 is also expressed in other tissues suggests additional possible functions for this protein. Several angiopoietins and angiopoietin-like proteins molecules have recently been identified (5Davis S. Aldrich T.H. Jones P.F. Acheson A. Compton D.L. Jain V. Ryan T.E. Bruno J. Radziejewski C.

As angiopoietin-like proteins, like angiopoietins, effect angiogenesis, they must use different mechanisms of signal transduction. In this report, we describe the structural and functional characterization of the human corneal angiopoietin-like factor CDT6. We found that CDT6 is produced as a secreted protein with an apparent molecular mass of 45 kDa. The fact that the molecular mass of CDT6 was larger than the expected molecular mass of 38 kDa, as calculated from its amino acid sequence, indicates post-translational modification of the protein. Consistent with this observation, the open reading frame of CDT6 contains several potential N-glycosylation sites (4Peek R. van Gelderen B.E. Bruinenberg M. Kijlstra A. Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 1998; 39: 1782-1788PubMed Google Scholar). This suggests that CDT6, similar to the angiopoietins, is produced as a glycoprotein. In angiopoietins, the coiled-coil domain mediates the formation of homo-oligomers that are stabilized by interchain disulfide bridges (7Valenzuela D.M. Griffiths J.A. Rojas J. Aldrich T.H. Jones P.F. Zhou H. McClain J. Copeland N.G. Gilbert D.J. Jenkins N.A. Huang T. Papadopoulos N. Maisonpierre P.C. Davis S. Yancopoulos G.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

This is thought to be required for the interaction of angiopoietins with the Tie2 receptor and thus might be crucial for ligand-mediated activity of the Tie receptor. By using CD spectroscopy and analytical centrifugation, we demonstrated that the predicted coiled-coil segment of CDT6 folds into a tetrameric coiled-coil structure in vitro. Consistent with these findings, CDT6 in vivo exists predominantly as disulfide-linked homotrimers and homotetramers. The intermolecular disulfide bridges are most likely formed by cysteine residues that flank the coiled-coil domain. These findings suggest that clustering of the fibrinogen-like domains of CDT6 might be required for the interaction of the protein with a yet unknown receptor on the cell surface. By expressing CDT6 in a human xenograft model, we demonstrated that this protein has a dramatic effect on a growing tissue with a high vascular density. Interestingly, in xenografts with the highest expression of CDT6, tumor volume was reduced up to 6-fold 4 weeks after inoculation. As these tumors require a dense vascular network for rapid growth the expression of CDT6, similar to that of angiopoietins, might interfere with angiogenesis resulting in a suppression of tumor growth. Consistent with this assumption, immunohistochemical analysis of tissue sections of CDT6 expressing xenografts stained for blood vessel endothelial cells indeed showed aberrant blood vessels. The blood vessel diameter and lumen was significantly increased as determined by automated image analysis (12Van der Laak J.A. Westphal J.R. Schalkwijk L.J. Pahlplatz M.M. Ruiter D.J. de Waal R.M. de Wilde P.C. J. Pathol. 1998; 184: 136-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). From these results we initially assumed that similar to angiopoietin-1 and angiopoietin-2, CDT6 was involved in vascular morphogenesis. However, not only blood vessel endothelial cells but also the tumor cells themselves appeared to be affected in their morphology by expressing CDT6. Whereas the cells in control tumors were spaced in a relatively ordered fashion, in the CDT6 tumors cells were more elongated and appeared to align to higher order structures. In theory, the observed increase in extracellular matrix components might also be accounted for by a CDT6-induced fibrotic response of host (mouse) cells such as fibroblasts as a defense against the invading tumor cells.

A fundamental oligomerization motif is the “coiled-coil,” which modulates protein structure and dynamics through its ability to mediate homotypic as well as heterotypic associations (for reviews of coiled-coils, see Refs. 1Lupas A.

Because of its central role in biology and also because of its apparent simplicity, the coiled-coil motif has evoked considerable interest as a biological motif and as a paradigm for studies of protein folding (8Lumb K.J.

Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 80-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar).The coiled-coil structural motif comprises two or more right-handed α-helices wrapped around each other with a small, left-handed superhelical twist (13Crick F.H.C. Acta Crystallogr. 1953; 6: 689-697Crossref Google Scholar). The hallmark of coiled-coils at the primary structure level is a seven-residue repeating sequence termed the heptad repeat in which the first and fourth residues (i.e.a and d in the sequence abcdefg) typically occupy the interhelical interface and are generally hydrophobic. Extensive structural and thermodynamic analyses of native and model coiled-coils have revealed that the shape and packing of thea and d residues determine, to a large extent, the stability and the preferred oligomerization state of the coiled-coils whereas the e and g residues, which are generally bulky, polar, or charged, contribute toward specificity and establishment of the proper chain register positions (9Monera O.D. Zhou N.E. Kay C.M. Hodges R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19218-19227Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14–27). Despite these advances in our understanding, reliable predictions of the preferred oligomerization state as well as packing of individual subunits remains a challenge for many naturally occurring coiled-coils.Heat shock-binding protein 1 (HSBP1) is a 76-residue acidic protein that was isolated from a yeast two-hybrid screen using the coiled-coil containing trimerization domain of heat shock transcription factor HSF1 as the bait (28Satyal S.H. Chen D. Fox S.G. Kramer J.M. Morimoto R.I. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1962-1974Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Yeast two-hybrid assays with HSBP1 as both bait and prey indicate that HSBP1 self-associates (Ref. 28Satyal S.H. Chen D. Fox S.G. Kramer J.M. Morimoto R.I. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1962-1974Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar, and see below). HSBP1 is highly conserved in a wide variety of organisms but has no readily identifiable homologues in the repository of experimentally determined high resolution structures in the Research Collaboratory for Structural Bioinformatics Protein Data Bank (www.rcsb.org). Sequence analysis suggested a highly helical protein with two tandem arrays of heptad repeat devoid of other readily recognizable structural motif(s).These attributes of the HSBP protein family led us to characterize the biochemical and biophysical properties of human HSBP1. Here, we show that HSBP1 is an evolutionarily conserved protein that exists as a highly helical, homotrimeric coiled-coil with the individual subunits arranged in a parallel and unstaggered manner relative to each other. Although coiled-coil proteins are relatively common, to our knowledge, HSBP1 is the first protein that has been described that is composed solely of a coiled-coil domain. Thus, the HSBP protein family may represent a new, structurally distinct subtype of coiled-coils and can serve as a model for understanding the structural principles of coiled-coils.DISCUSSIONThe results of our biophysical and biochemical analyses led us to propose a structural model for HSBP1 illustrated in Fig.10. According to this model, HSBP1 consists of a single and continuous α-helical region (∼49 residues) with unstructured regions at the amino and carboxyl termini. The helical regions associate in a parallel and unstaggered manner to form a coiled-coil trimer of a highly elongated shape. HSBP1 is unusual in that, unlike many proteins, the protein appears to be characterized by only a single structural feature, namely a coiled-coil trimerization domain.The coiled-coil region is highly conserved, and the high degree of sequence conservation across the entire HSBP family suggests that the biophysical properties described herein for human HSBP1 are likely to be relevant to other members of the family. It also suggests the importance of the conserved coiled-coil domain to HSBP function. For the heptad repeat regions to form coiled-coils, the overall sequence can diverge as long as similarly sized hydrophobic residues are located at the a and d positions to ensure packing of the interhelical space. Thus, the sequence conservation of HSBP suggests that the helical region may have other purposes in addition to self-association. Furthermore, it is likely that protein domains that interact with HSBP will also be highly conserved because of co-evolution. Although HSBP1 was originally identified through its interaction with HSF1 trimerization domain in the yeast two-hybrid essay, the HSF1 trimerization domain is comparatively more divergent. (Sequence similarity between HSF1 trimerization domain across plant and animal kingdoms is ∼30% (Ref. 63Wu C. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1995; 11: 441-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (964) Google Scholar); in contrast, sequence similarity between HSBP1 trimerization domain across plant and animal kingdoms is more than 65%.) This suggests that HSBP1 may interact with proteins other than the trimerization domain of HSF1 in the cell.The fact that HSBP1 forms a continuous helix and is a trimer strongly suggests that both HR-N and HR-C participate in coiled-coil interactions. However, the coiled-coil prediction based on protein sequence data suggests that HR-N has a relatively low probability to form a coiled-coil and that the helical region of HSBP1 may not be continuous (Fig. 1). We suggest that this discrepancy results from the presence of consecutive hydrophobic residues in the first two heptads of HR-N and the presence of a conserved threonine residue at thea position of the first repeat. Hydrophobic amino acids at the c and g positions in HR-N dictate that some of the hydrophobic residues are exposed to the solvent and capable of providing additional hydrophobic interacting surface for competing oligomerization states. Indeed when the hydrophobic residues at theg and c positions were changed to hydrophilic residues, the predicted probability for coiled-coil formation increased substantially (from 30% to >50%). Additionally replacing the threonine, which is not commonly found at the a position in coiled-coils (49Lupas A. Van Dyke M. Stock J. Science. 1991; 252: 1162-1164Crossref PubMed Scopus (3452) Google Scholar) with a leucine increases the probability even further (to 80%). These results indicate that, although the heptad repeat appears to be a relatively simple motif and has been extensively studied, there are complexities (for review, see Ref. 64Lupas A. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1997; 7: 388-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar) dictating the formation of coiled-coils that are not well understood. Studies of HSBP1 protein family could thus provide new insights into the relationship between protein sequence and coiled-coil structure and function and allow more reliable predictions.Although the 49-residue helical region (corresponding to ∼14 helical turns) of HSBP1 implies a fairly extensive coiled-coil interface in the HSBP1 trimer, the protein exhibits surprisingly modest thermal stability (Tm ∼50 °C), comparable with that of the zipper region (∼10 helical turns) of dimeric basic leucine zipper transcription factors (65O'Shea E.K. Rutkowski R. Kim P.S. Cell. 1992; 68: 699-708Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar), but in marked contrast to the tetrameric soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptor complex (∼17 helical turns andTm >90 °C) (66Fasshauer D. Eliason W.K. Brünger A.T. Jahn R. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 10354-10362Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). A survey of previously characterized coiled-coils, however, reveals no correlation between helix length and thermal stability. Many structural proteins, including myosin, contain relatively long coiled-coil domains (in excess of 600 residues) but have relatively low melting temperatures (Tm between 40 and 50 °C) (67Zolkiewski M. Redowicz M.J. Korn E.D. Hammer J.A. Ginsburg A. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 7876-7883Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 68King L. Seidel J.C. Lehrer S.S. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 6770-6774Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Thus, although the coiled-coil domain of HSBP1 is similar in length to that of many proteins involved in transcriptional activation and signal transduction, unlike these domains, its thermal stability is comparatively lower and resembles that of the coiled-coil domains of structural proteins.Another remarkable feature of the HSBP1 protein, possibly related to its modest thermal stability, is the prevalence of motional processes on the millisecond time scale particularly in the coiled-coil region. Interestingly, the polypeptide backbone in this region appears to be relatively rigid on the picosecond to nanosecond time scale as indicated by the uniformly large (1H)-15N NOE values. Although previous studies of basic leucine zipper domain of GCN4 implicate motional processes on picosecond/nanosecond time scale in the DNA-binding domain immediately adjacent to the coiled-coil region (69Bracken C. Carr P.A. Cavanagh J. Palmer III, A.G. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 285: 2133-2146Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar), slower time scale processes in the coiled-coil region are not apparent. The coiled-coil region of HSBP1 thus appears to be unique in this regard. Although the origin of the slower motional processes is presently unknown, we note the rapid subunit exchange between HSBP1 oligomers within minutes of incubation in our native gel studies, as well as the rapid exchange of oligomerization states implied by sedimentation velocity data (500 μm, Fig. 9). Indeed, we note a striking parallel with the Fos-Jun heterodimer, which exhibits rapid dissociation kinetics in the absence of cognate DNA but not when the AP-1 DNA binding site is present (70Patel L.R. Curran T. Kerppola T.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 7360-7364Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Thus, dynamic motions in the millisecond time scale observed in the coiled-coil region of HSBP1 may be coupled to its biological function.The fact that human HSBP1 has only one readily recognizable structural motif suggests that it functions most likely by associating with other proteins through coiled-coil interactions. Whether it interacts through the same residues that are involved in stabilizing the trimer or through an entirely different surface remains to be explored. The former possibility, which involves dissociation of the trimer into individual subunits is attractive because the kinetics of subunit exchange deduced qualitatively from native gel analyses is relatively rapid (i.e. on the minute time scale). The second possibility, which involves formation of a higher order oligomeric complex with the HSBP trimer, cannot be ruled out because the HR-N region contains multiple, conserved hydrophobic residues at thec and g positions that can mediate specific association with other proteins. A particularly well characterized example of this type of interaction involving a homotrimer has been described for hemagglutinin, a glycoprotein of the influenza virus (71Wilson I.A. Skehel J.J. Wiley D.C. Nature. 1981; 289: 366-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (1967) Google Scholar). Although the degree of sequence conservation at the NH2 and COOH termini is low (Fig. 1), we cannot formally exclude the possibility of these regions being involved in some aspect of protein function.Our biophysical and biochemical characterization of HSBP1 constitutes the first step toward defining the functional properties of this novel protein family. Unlike other coiled-coil proteins in which the oligomerization domain functions in concert with other domains, such as during transcriptional activation or signal transduction, HSBP1 appears to function solely through protein oligomerization perhaps to regulate the function of other proteins. Additional studies are required to clarify the role of HSBP in the cell, but it is expected that the structural and dynamical features of this protein describe herein will be particularly important for designing experiments and interpreting results that will lead to a better understanding of the mechanism of regulation via coiled-coil interactions in general, and this evolutionarily conserved protein in particular. Protein oligomerization is a general mechanism for regulating and mediating diverse cellular processes including cytoskeletal interaction and cell motility, transcriptional activation, membrane trafficking, and intracellular signaling. A fundamental oligomerization motif is the “coiled-coil,” which modulates protein structure and dynamics through its ability to mediate homotypic as well as heterotypic associations (for reviews of coiled-coils, see Refs. 1Lupas A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 375-382Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1008) Google Scholarand 2Beck K. Brodsky B. J. Struct. Biol. 1998; 122: 17-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). Prominent examples of coiled-coil proteins include desmin and keratins forming the rigid framework of intermediate filaments (3Geisler N. Kaufmann E. Weber K.

Because of its central role in biology and also because of its apparent simplicity, the coiled-coil motif has evoked considerable interest as a biological motif and as a paradigm for studies of protein folding (8Lumb K.J.

The coiled-coil structural motif comprises two or more right-handed α-helices wrapped around each other with a small, left-handed superhelical twist (13Crick F.H.C. Acta Crystallogr. 1953; 6: 689-697Crossref Google Scholar). The hallmark of coiled-coils at the primary structure level is a seven-residue repeating sequence termed the heptad repeat in which the first and fourth residues (i.e.a and d in the sequence abcdefg) typically occupy the interhelical interface and are generally hydrophobic. Extensive structural and thermodynamic analyses of native and model coiled-coils have revealed that the shape and packing of thea and d residues determine, to a large extent, the stability and the preferred oligomerization state of the coiled-coils whereas the e and g residues, which are generally bulky, polar, or charged, contribute toward specificity and establishment of the proper chain register positions (9Monera O.D. Zhou N.E. Kay C.M. Hodges R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19218-19227Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14–27). Despite these advances in our understanding, reliable predictions of the preferred oligomerization state as well as packing of individual subunits remains a challenge for many naturally occurring coiled-coils. Heat shock-binding protein 1 (HSBP1) is a 76-residue acidic protein that was isolated from a yeast two-hybrid screen using the coiled-coil containing trimerization domain of heat shock transcription factor HSF1 as the bait (28Satyal S.H. Chen D. Fox S.G. Kramer J.M. Morimoto R.I. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1962-1974Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Yeast two-hybrid assays with HSBP1 as both bait and prey indicate that HSBP1 self-associates (Ref. 28Satyal S.H. Chen D. Fox S.G. Kramer J.M. Morimoto R.I. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1962-1974Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar, and see below). HSBP1 is highly conserved in a wide variety of organisms but has no readily identifiable homologues in the repository of experimentally determined high resolution structures in the Research Collaboratory for Structural Bioinformatics Protein Data Bank (www.rcsb.org). Sequence analysis suggested a highly helical protein with two tandem arrays of heptad repeat devoid of other readily recognizable structural motif(s). These attributes of the HSBP protein family led us to characterize the biochemical and biophysical properties of human HSBP1. Here, we show that HSBP1 is an evolutionarily conserved protein that exists as a highly helical, homotrimeric coiled-coil with the individual subunits arranged in a parallel and unstaggered manner relative to each other. Although coiled-coil proteins are relatively common, to our knowledge, HSBP1 is the first protein that has been described that is composed solely of a coiled-coil domain. Thus, the HSBP protein family may represent a new, structurally distinct subtype of coiled-coils and can serve as a model for understanding the structural principles of coiled-coils. DISCUSSIONThe results of our biophysical and biochemical analyses led us to propose a structural model for HSBP1 illustrated in Fig.10. According to this model, HSBP1 consists of a single and continuous α-helical region (∼49 residues) with unstructured regions at the amino and carboxyl termini. The helical regions associate in a parallel and unstaggered manner to form a coiled-coil trimer of a highly elongated shape. HSBP1 is unusual in that, unlike many proteins, the protein appears to be characterized by only a single structural feature, namely a coiled-coil trimerization domain.The coiled-coil region is highly conserved, and the high degree of sequence conservation across the entire HSBP family suggests that the biophysical properties described herein for human HSBP1 are likely to be relevant to other members of the family. It also suggests the importance of the conserved coiled-coil domain to HSBP function. For the heptad repeat regions to form coiled-coils, the overall sequence can diverge as long as similarly sized hydrophobic residues are located at the a and d positions to ensure packing of the interhelical space. Thus, the sequence conservation of HSBP suggests that the helical region may have other purposes in addition to self-association. Furthermore, it is likely that protein domains that interact with HSBP will also be highly conserved because of co-evolution. Although HSBP1 was originally identified through its interaction with HSF1 trimerization domain in the yeast two-hybrid essay, the HSF1 trimerization domain is comparatively more divergent. (Sequence similarity between HSF1 trimerization domain across plant and animal kingdoms is ∼30% (Ref. 63Wu C. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1995; 11: 441-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (964) Google Scholar); in contrast, sequence similarity between HSBP1 trimerization domain across plant and animal kingdoms is more than 65%.) This suggests that HSBP1 may interact with proteins other than the trimerization domain of HSF1 in the cell.The fact that HSBP1 forms a continuous helix and is a trimer strongly suggests that both HR-N and HR-C participate in coiled-coil interactions. However, the coiled-coil prediction based on protein sequence data suggests that HR-N has a relatively low probability to form a coiled-coil and that the helical region of HSBP1 may not be continuous (Fig. 1). We suggest that this discrepancy results from the presence of consecutive hydrophobic residues in the first two heptads of HR-N and the presence of a conserved threonine residue at thea position of the first repeat. Hydrophobic amino acids at the c and g positions in HR-N dictate that some of the hydrophobic residues are exposed to the solvent and capable of providing additional hydrophobic interacting surface for competing oligomerization states. Indeed when the hydrophobic residues at theg and c positions were changed to hydrophilic residues, the predicted probability for coiled-coil formation increased substantially (from 30% to >50%). Additionally replacing the threonine, which is not commonly found at the a position in coiled-coils (49Lupas A. Van Dyke M. Stock J. Science. 1991; 252: 1162-1164Crossref PubMed Scopus (3452) Google Scholar) with a leucine increases the probability even further (to 80%). These results indicate that, although the heptad repeat appears to be a relatively simple motif and has been extensively studied, there are complexities (for review, see Ref. 64Lupas A. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1997; 7: 388-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar) dictating the formation of coiled-coils that are not well understood. Studies of HSBP1 protein family could thus provide new insights into the relationship between protein sequence and coiled-coil structure and function and allow more reliable predictions.Although the 49-residue helical region (corresponding to ∼14 helical turns) of HSBP1 implies a fairly extensive coiled-coil interface in the HSBP1 trimer, the protein exhibits surprisingly modest thermal stability (Tm ∼50 °C), comparable with that of the zipper region (∼10 helical turns) of dimeric basic leucine zipper transcription factors (65O'Shea E.K. Rutkowski R. Kim P.S. Cell. 1992; 68: 699-708Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar), but in marked contrast to the tetrameric soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptor complex (∼17 helical turns andTm >90 °C) (66Fasshauer D. Eliason W.K. Brünger A.T. Jahn R. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 10354-10362Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar).

However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the two events as well as their relationship are not well understood; on the contrary, there has been increasing evidence indicating that anti-microtubule agents might induce apoptosis via signaling pathways independent of mitosis. In this study, we found that apoptosis induced by noscapine, an anti-microtubule drug previously shown to cause both mitotic arrest and apoptotic cell death, was blocked by inhibiting p34 cdc2 activity with olomoucine in FM3A murine mammary carcinoma cells or by reducing the level and activity of p34 cdc2 in a mutant cell line FT210 derived from FM3A. Furthermore, transfection of the mutant FT210 cells with wild-type p34cdc2 restored their ability to undergo mitotic arrest and then apoptosis in response to noscapine. Thus, we conclude that sustained activation of the p34 cdc2 kinase during mitotic arrest is required for subsequent apoptosis induced by noscapine, establishing a link between the two events.

Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 35-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). The dynamic polymerization and depolymerization of microtubules is crucial for their cellular functions; disruption of microtubule dynamics can lead to the formation of abnormally stable or unstable microtubules, thereby preventing the normal dynamic rearrangement of the microtubule arrays required for cell division. Typically, cells treated with anti-microtubule drugs (e.g. paclitaxel, colchicine, vinca alkaloids, etc.) arrest at mitosis, resulting from the disruption of proper mitotic spindle formation, and then undergo apoptosis (2Lotem J.

The next question was whether the mitotic arrest and apoptosis caused by anti-microtubule agents were two intimately related events or two independent consequences of disrupting the normal physiological balance of microtubule dynamics. Because mitotic arrest caused by anti-microtubule drugs precedes apoptosis, a natural hypothesis that mitotic arrest was the cause of apoptosis has gained widespread support (11King K.L. Cidlowski J.A. J. Cell. Biochem. 1995; 58: 175-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar). However, several recent studies suggest that anti-microtubule agents might induce apoptosis via signaling pathways independent of mitosis (12Long B.H. Fairchild C.R. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 4355-4361PubMed Google Scholar, 13Lieu C.H. Chang Y.N. Lai Y.K. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1997; 53: 1587-1596Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 14Torres K.E. Castillo G.

Cheng J.S. Willingham M.C. Cell Pharmacol. 1996; 3: 343-348Google Scholar). For example, either a brief exposure to a high concentration of paclitaxel or a long exposure a low concentration of paclitaxel could drive cells into apoptosis in the absence of mitotic block (12Long B.H. Fairchild C.R. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 4355-4361PubMed Google Scholar, 13Lieu C.H. Chang Y.N. Lai Y.K. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1997; 53: 1587-1596Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 14Torres K.E. Castillo G. Horwitz S.B. Proc. Am. Assoc. Cancer Res. 1997; 38: 530Google Scholar). In addition, baccatin III, the central ring system of paclitaxel structure, has been found to induce apoptotic cell death without causing mitotic arrest; instead, many apoptotic events were found in other phases of the cell cycle (15Fan W. Miller M.C. Cheng R.L. Willingham M.C. Microsc. Microanal. 1998; 4: 1042-1043Crossref Google Scholar, 16Miller III, M.C. Johnson K.R. Willingham M.C. Fan W. Cancer Chemother. Pharmacol. 1999; 44: 444-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Another significant evidence that supports the apoptotic pathway independent of mitotic arrest comes from the finding that glucocorticoids selectively inhibit paclitaxel-induced apoptosis without blocking cells at mitotis (17Fan W. Cheng L.R. Norris J.S. Willingham M.C. Cell Pharmacol. 1996; 3: 435-440Google Scholar,18Fan W. Schandl C.A. Cheng J.S. Willingham M.C. Cell Pharmacol. 1996; 3: 343-348Google Scholar). Thus, the precise molecular mechanisms underlying apoptosis and mitotic arrest induced by anti-microtubule agents and the relationship between the two events are not clear at present. We have previously shown that noscapine, an alkaloid from opium, alters microtubule assembly dynamics, arrests cells at mitosis, and causes apoptosis in many mammalian tumor cell lines (19Ye K. Ke Y. Keshava N. Kapp J.A. Shanks J. Tekmal R.R. Petros J. Joshi H.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 1601-1606Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). Since in eukaryotic cells the entry into mitosis and the exit from it require sequential activation and inactivation of the p34 cdc2 kinase (20Murray A.W. Kirschner M.W. Nature. 1989; 339: 275-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (863) Google Scholar), a sustained activation of p34 cdc2 during mitotic arrest might be required for noscapine-induced apoptosis. The purpose of this study was to test this hypothesis. Our results demonstrate that noscapine-induced apoptosis is blocked by inhibiting p34 cdc2 activity with olomoucine in FM3A murine mammary carcinoma cells or by reducing the level and activity of p34 cdc2 in a mutant cell line FT210 derived from FM3A. Furthermore, transfection of the wild-type p34 cdc2 is able to restore noscapine-induced apoptosis in the mutant FT210 cells. Thus, our results, for the first time, show that sustained activition of p34 cdc2 during mitotic arrest is required for apoptosis induced by the anti-microtubule drug noscapine. FM3A and FT210 cells were grown at 32 °C with 5% CO2 in RPMI 1640 with 10% calf serum. Wild-type and dominant negative p34 cdc2 expressing plasmids (pCMVcdc2 and pCMVcdc2-dn, respectively) were provided by Dr. Ed Harlow and Dr. Sander van den Heuvel (Massachusetts General Hospital). The β-galactosidase expressing plasmid pCMVβ was from Dr. Arthur Lee (Harvard School of Public Health). Proteins extracted from noscapine-treated or untreated cells were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Then, proteins were transferred onto nitrocellulose membrane and exposed to antibodies. Specific proteins were visualized using enhanced chemiluminescence following the manufacturer's instructions (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.). Histone H1 kinase activity was analyzed by the method described by Murray and Kirschner (20Murray A.W. Kirschner M.W. Nature. 1989; 339: 275-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (863) Google Scholar). The incorporation of [32P]phosphate was visualized by autoradiography and quantified with a PhosphorImager and imageQuant software (Molecular Dynamics). Cells were washed twice with cold phosphate-buffered saline and then resuspended in 100 μl of binding buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 140 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm CaCl2). Cells were incubated with 5 μl of FITC1-conjugated annexin V (BD PharMingen) for 15 min at room temperature in the dark. Then 400 μl of binding buffer was added, and cells were analyzed by flow cytometry according to the method of Andreassen and Margolis (21Andreassen P.R. Margolis R.L. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 789-802Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Data were collected using FACScan (Becton Dickson & Co., San Jose, CA), and results were analyzed with LYSIS II software. FT210 cells grown on glass coverslips were transiently co-transfected with pCMVβ and pCMVcdc2 in the absence or presence of pCMVcdc2-dn using FuGENETM 6 reagent (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The expression of β-galactosidase was used for the identification of transfected cells. Morphological changes in the nuclear chromatin of cells were detected by staining with propidium iodide and observed with a Zeiss Axiovert 135 fluorescence microscope. The opium alkaloid noscapine has been found in our previous studies to cause mitotic arrest and apoptosis in many mammalian tumor cell lines both in vitro and in vivo (19Ye K. Ke Y. Keshava N. Kapp J.A. Shanks J. Tekmal R.R. Petros J. Joshi H.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 1601-1606Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). In this study, we first examined the effect of noscapine in FM3A murine mammary carcinoma cells by flow cytometric analysis. Strikingly, increasing number of FM3A cells accumulated with a duplicated complement of DNA up to 48 h of noscapine treatment and then underwent death (data not shown). This pattern of cell death following a prior mitotic arrest is similar to those previously observed in cells treated with other anti-microtubule agents (2Lotem J. Sachs L. Blood. 1992; 80: 1750-1757Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3Bhalla K. Ibrado A.M. Tourkina E. Tang C. Mahoney M.E. Huang Y. Leukemia. 1993; 7: 563-568PubMed Google Scholar, 4Jordan M.A. Toso R.J.

Chem. 1998; 273: 30777-30784Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). Since the exit from mitosis requires inactivation of the p34 cdc2 kinase, the arrested mitosis suggests that sustained activation of the p34 cdc2 kinase during mitotic arrest may be a link between mitosis and apoptosis. To examine this, we inhibited p34 cdc2 activity with olomoucine, a purine derivative that inhibits cyclin-dependent kinases (22Vesely J. Havlicek L. Strnad M. Blow J.J. Donella-Deana A. Pinna L. Letham D.S. Kato J. Detivaud L. Lecler S. Meijer L. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 224: 771-786Crossref PubMed Scopus (611) Google Scholar, 23Paulson J.R. Patzlaff J.S. Vallis A.J. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 1437-1447Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As expected, 50 μm olomoucine greatly inhibited the histone H1 kinase activity of FM3A cells (Fig. 1 A). A concentration of 50 and 100 μm olomoucine effectively inhibited noscapine-induced apoptosis, whereas olomoucine alone at these concentrations had no apoptotic effect on FM3A cells (Fig. 1 B). To test whether it is really p34 cdc2 that is required for noscapine-induced apoptosis or it is some other mitotic events, with p34 cdc2 simply required for mitotic entry, we synchronized FM3A cells by double thymidine block, treated with noscapine to arrest them in mitosis and then added olomoucine to inhibit p34 cdc2 activity. We examined the cells by annexin V staining, which reports the loss of membrane phosphatidylserine asymmetry at the early stage of apoptosis. As shown in Fig. 1 C, olomoucine significantly reduced the occurrence of noscapine-induced apoptosis. Thus, olomoucine inhibited noscapine-induced apoptosis by blocking p34 cdc2 activation, consistent with our hypothesis that p34 cdc2 activation is required for noscapine-induced apoptosis. Although olomoucine blocked p34 cdc2 activity, it might have also blocked the activities of some other important kinases involved in noscapine-induced apoptosis. Thus we used an alternative means to examine the requirement for a sustained high activity of p34 cdc2 kinase in noscapine-induced apoptosis. To do this, we made use of a temperature-sensitive mutant cell line FT210, which is derived from FM3A (24Th'ng J.P.H. Wright P.S. Hamaguchi J. Lee M.G. Norbury C.J. Nurse P. Bradbury E.M. Cell. 1990; 63: 313-324Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). FT210 cells have two point mutations with changes of a proline to serine within the C-terminal region of p34 cdc2 and the protein-destabilizing motif PSTAIR into PSTAVR. As a consequence, FT210 cells have a much lower level and activity of p34 cdc2 compared with the parental FM3A cells even at the permissive temperature 32 °C (Fig. 2,A and B). At the restrictive temperature 39 °C, most of the mutant cells were either swollen or damaged, and the cellular debris made it impossible to make careful observations. Thus, in this study all of our experiments were performed at the permissive temperature. We compared quantitatively the effects of noscapine on the morphological changes in nuclear DNA in the two cell lines (Fig. 2 C). With the increasing time of noscapine treatment of up to 12∼24 h, the number of mitotic figures in the wild-type FM3A cells dramatically increased; however, mitotic figures declined in number upon longer treatment while the number of apoptotic figures increased (Fig. 2 C, left panel). In contrast, both the number of mitotic cells and that of apoptotic cells increased slowly in mutant FT210 cells during 72 h of noscapine treatment (Fig. 2 C, right panel). Thus, clearly the mutant FT210 cells with compromised p34 cdc2 stability were much more resistant to the effect of noscapine on mitotic arrest and apoptosis compared with the parental FM3A cells. Next, we examined the histone H1 kinase activity of FM3A and FT210 cells in response to noscapine treatment (Fig. 2 D). As expected from the peak appearance of the mitotic figures at 12∼24 h of noscapine treatment (Fig. 2 C, left panel), the histone H1 kinase activity in the cell lysates of FM3A cells also peaked at this time and then declined slowly as the number of cells undergoing apoptosis increased (Fig. 2 D, left panel). In contrast, the p34 cdc2 mutant FT210 cells showed much lower histone H1 kinase activity in response to noscapine treatment (Fig. 2 D, right panel). Thus, a high level of active p34 cdc2 kinase during mitotic arrest might be required for noscapine-induced apoptosis. The lower extent of apoptosis in response to noscapine in FT210 cells indicates that the resistance to noscapine-induced apoptosis is due to the low amount and activity of p34 cdc2 in FT210 cells. To confirm this, we transfected the mutant FT210 cells with pCMVcdc2, which expresses wild-type p34 cdc2, and then treated these cells with 50 μm noscapine. We found that after 72 h of noscapine treatment as many as 62.8% of pCMVcdc2-transfected FT210 cells underwent apoptosis compared with 11.2% in cells transfected with the control plasmid pCMVβ (Fig. 3). Furthermore, transfection of FT210 cells with pCMVcdc2 in the presence of excessive pCMVcdc2-dn, which expresses dominant negative p34 cdc2, significantly reduced the percentage of apoptosis to 12.6% (Fig. 3). Thus, sustained activation of the p34 cdc2 kinase is indeed required for noscapine-induced apoptosis. While it is still controversial today as to how anti-microtubule agents, such as paclitaxel and vinblastine, cause apoptosis, our results demonstrate that sustained activation of the p34 cdc2 kinase during mitotic arrest is required for apoptosis induced by the novel anti-microtubule drug noscapine, establishing a link between mitotic arrest and apoptosis. We have also examined the effects of paclitaxel on the p34 cdc2 mutant FT210 cells and achieved similar results (data not shown). Our findings are also consistent with several other reports (9Yu D.

Goolsby G.L. Kiener P.A. Wahl A.F. Cell Growth Differ. 1994; 5: 1041-1050PubMed Google Scholar), fragmentin-2-induced apoptosis in YAC-1 lymphoma cells (26Shi L. Nishioka W.K. Th'ng J. Bradbury E.M.

Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 4551-4555PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, overexpression of dominant negative p34 cdc2 blocked tumor necrosis factor- and staurosporine-induced apoptosis in HeLa cells (28Meikrantz W. Schlegel R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10205-10209Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar), and overexpression of ErbB2 could block paclitaxel-induced apoptosis via up-regulation of p21, which inhibits p34 cdc2 activity (9Yu D. Jing T. Liu B. Yao J. Tan M. McDonnell T.J. Hung M.C. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 581-591Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A recent report also shows the necessity for cyclin-dependent kinase activity during death-associated chromatin condensation and other manifestations of apoptotic cell death, such as cell shrinkage and loss of adhesion to the substrate (29Harvey K.J. Lukovic D. Ucker D.S. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 59-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The next question is how sustained activation of p34 cdc2 leads to apoptosis. Interestingly, hyperphosphorylation of Bcl-2 has been observed during paclitaxel-induced apoptosis (30Haldar S. Jena N. Croce C.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4507-4511Crossref PubMed Scopus (746) Google Scholar, 31Yamamoto K. Ichijo H. Korsmeyer S.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 8469-8478Crossref PubMed Scopus (917) Google Scholar). Since phosphorylation of Bcl-2, which is thought to negatively regulate the anti-apoptotic effects, can promote apoptotic cell death (30Haldar S. Jena N. Croce C.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4507-4511Crossref PubMed Scopus (746) Google Scholar, 31Yamamoto K. Ichijo H. Korsmeyer S.J. Mol. Cell.

Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 3202-3208PubMed Google Scholar), the p34 cdc2 kinase might be involved in a phospho-regulatory pathway that can promote Bcl-2 phosphorylation and eventually apoptosis. Yamamoto et al. (31Yamamoto K. Ichijo H. Korsmeyer S.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 8469-8478Crossref PubMed Scopus (917) Google Scholar) found that the ASK1/JNK pathway is responsible for Bcl-2 phosphorylation at mitosis in paclitaxel-treated Jurkat cells. It is conceivable that noscapine, being a tubulin-interacting agent that arrests cells at mitosis (19Ye K. Ke Y. Keshava N. Kapp J.A. Shanks J. Tekmal R.R. Petros J. Joshi H.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 1601-1606Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar), might cause apoptosis by a similar mechanism to that of paclitaxel-induced apoptosis. In this study, we have shown the inhibition of noscapine-induced apoptosis in p34 cdc2 mutant murine mammary FT210 cells; however, these cells were previously shown to be susceptible to several of the pro-apoptotic stimuli such as C2-ceramide, UV irradiation, H2O2, and actinomycin D (35Martin S.J. McGahon A.J. Nishioka W.K. La Face D. Guo X. Th'ng J. Bradbury E.M. Green D.R. Science. 1995; 268: 106-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Thus, p34 cdc2 is clearly not involved in all forms of apoptosis. This is also consistent with the reports that apoptosis can be induced in many stages of the cell cycle (36Meikrantz W. Gisselbrecht S. Tam S.W. Schlegel R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 3754-3758Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar, 37Friedlander R.M. Gagliardini V. Rotello R.J. Yuan J. J. Exp.

Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 2244-2251PubMed Google Scholar), and there is no evidence that any of these stimuli induces apoptosis through mitotic arrest. Therefore, although we show that p34 cdc2 is required for targeting noscapine-arrested cells from mitosis to apoptosis, we recognize that alternative pathways must exist to link other phases of the cell cycle to apoptotic pathways. Nonetheless, our results establish a clear link between mitotic arrest caused by the anti-microtubule drug noscapine and subsequent apoptosis."
https://openalex.org/W2020331910,"Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) is a key regulator of a variety of cellular functions from cytoskeletal organization, vesicular trafficking, and cell proliferation to apoptosis. The enzyme complex is comprised of an 85-kDa adaptor (p85) coupled to a 110-kDa catalytic subunit (p110). While the function of PI3K has been largely attributed to the generation of D-3 lipids, an unanswered question has been whether p85 with a number of motifs (SH2, SH3, BcR homology (BH) region) can generate independent intracellular signals. In this study, we demonstrate that p85 lacking p110 (Δp85) can activate NFAT transcription in T-cell hybridomas and normal splenocytes. This up-regulatory effect was unaffected by inhibition of PI 3-kinase, and cooperated specifically with Rac1, but not related family members. Stimulation correlated with Rac1 binding and was lost with the deletion of the BH domain. Lastly, the CD28-Δp85 chimera also cooperated with TcR/CD3 to provide co-signals that enhanced IL-2 transcription. Our findings identify for the first time p85 as an adaptor that operates independently of the classic PI 3-kinase catalytic pathway and further shows that this pathway can provide co-signals in the regulation of T-cell function."

Later, the membrane-bound form, CD38, which has catalytic activities of not only ADP-ribosyl cyclase but also cADPR hydrolase, was cloned from different species (12Jackson D.G. Bell J.I. J.

Acta. 1994; 1223: 160-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). CD38s have highly conserved 12 cysteine residues in their extracellular domain. Aplysia ADP-ribosyl cyclases have homology of the 12 cysteine residues but two amino acid residues; cysteine 119 and cysteine 201 in the human CD38 are replaced by lysine and glutamic acid, respectively (15Tohgo A. Takasawa S. Noguchi N. Koguma T. Nata K. Sugimoto T. Furuya Y. Yonekura H. Okamoto H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28555-28557Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). When the cysteine 119 and cysteine 201 were replaced with lysine and glutamic acid, respectively, by site-directed mutagenesis, the CD38 mutant resulted in the disappearance of cADPR hydrolase activity but not cyclase activity (15Tohgo A. Takasawa S. Noguchi N. Koguma T. Nata K. Sugimoto T. Furuya Y. Yonekura H. Okamoto H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28555-28557Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This finding demonstrates that cysteine 119 and cysteine 201 in CD38 play an important role in cADPR hydrolysis and also explains whyAplysia enzyme lacks cADPR hydrolase. An inference from the crystal structure of Aplysia cyclase is that CD38 has six disulfide bonds instead of the five bonds of the Aplysiaenzyme. The sixth disulfide bond connecting the cysteine 119 and cysteine 201 of CD38 may be important for cross-linking to other molecules, and their reduction may render the hinge region less flexible (16Prasad G.S.

Biol. 1996; 3: 957-964Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). cyclic adenosine diphosphoribose l-2-oxothiazolidine-4-caboxylic acid green fluorescent protein enhanced GFP bovine serum albumin phosphate-buffered saline Hanks' balanced salt solution Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate buffer wild type l-2-oxothiazolidine-4-caboxylic acid (OTC) was obtained from Sigma and freshly prepared by dissolving the chemical in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and adjusting the pH to 7.2 with 3 n NaOH. Site-directed mutagenesis of CD38 was performed using the Mutan-KTM mutagenesis kit (Takara, Kyoto, Japan). The following oligonucleotides were used for the mutagenesis: 5′-AATCTTGTTTTTAGGTACGGTC-3′ (C119K), 5′-GACCACATCTTCGGCAGCTTCT-3′ (C201E), for human CD38, where underlined nucleotides were altered. The right mutant clones were selected by sequencing. A pRc/CMV vector carrying either the wild type or mutant human CD38 cDNA was introduced and expressed in HeLa cells The expression construct encoding CD38-enhanced green fluorescent fusion protein was constructed by the following. The coding sequence of CD38 was PCR-amplified from pFLAG-CD38 (CD38 cDNA in pFLAG-CMV vector) using the sense primer, 5′-GGAAGCTT ATGGCCAACTGCGAG-3′ (theHindIII site is underlined, the start codon of CD38 is bolded), and the antisense primer, 5′-GGTACCGTCGAC AATATCTC AGATGTGCAAGAT-3′ (theSalI site is underlined). Specially, the CD38 stop codon of the antisense primer was changed from the nucleotides (TAA), which code for the translation stop, to the nucleotides TTG, which code for the amino acid leucine. The PCR products were eluted from agarose using GeneClean Kit (Qbiogene, Carlsbad, CA) and subcloned using the TOPO TA cloning kit (Invitrogen). Then, after restriction digestion with HindIII and SalI, the PCR product was ligated with identically predigested pEGFP-N1 vector (CLONTECH) to create pEGFP-CD38. The expression construct encoding the fusion protein between EGFP and the CD38 variant from pFLAG-CMV vector and Jurket CD38 were constructed by a whole plasmid amplification strategy. A pRc/CMV vector carrying human CD38 cDNAs or GFP-human CD38 cDNA was purified and linearized by digestion with PvuI. HeLa cells (107 cells/ml) were transfected with the linearized DNA (10 μg) by LipofectAMINE transfection reagents (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Stable transfectants were selected for resistance to G418 (200 μg/ml), and positive clones were repetitively selected with anti-CD38 antibody coated Immulan beads. ADP-ribosyl cyclase and cADPR hydrolase assays were performed as described elsewhere (17Han M.K. Cho Y.S. Kim Y.S. Yim C.Y. Kim U.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20799-20805Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) with HeLa cell homogenates containing equal amounts of enzyme proteins of wild type and mutant, as estimated by Western blot analysis. HeLa cells (106 cells/ml) were incubated with anti-CD38 antibody (HB7, 1 μg/ml) for 30 min in ice and washed with Hanks' balanced salt solution (HBSS) (2 mm CaCl2, 145 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 5 mmd-glucose, 20 mm Hepes (pH 7.3)). CD38 ligation was performed by incubation of cells with anti-mouse IgG F(ab′)2 for 3 min at 37 °C. After washing with ice-cold PBS, the cells were immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80 °C. The frozen cells were added to 8% trichloroacetic acid to extract cADPR. The cADPR content was measured by a specific radioimmunoassay described elsewhere (18Takahashi K. Kukimoto I. Tokita K. Inageda K. Inoue S. Kontani K. Hoshino S. Nishina H. Kanaho Y. Katada T. FEBS Lett. 1995; 371: 204-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). HeLa cells were incubated with Fura-2/AM (4 μm) in RPMI 1640 medium containing 3% fetal bovine serum for 60 min at 37 °C. The Fura-2/AM-loaded cells were incubated with anti-CD38 antibody for 30 min in ice and washed with HBSS. For the fluorimetric measurement of Ca2+, 1 × 107cells were placed in a quartz cuvette in a thermostatically controlled cell holder at 37 °C, and the cell suspension was stirred continuously. After the addition of rabbit anti-mouse IgG F(ab′)2, fluorescence ratios were taken with an alternative wavelength time scanning method (dual excitation at 340 and 380 nm; emission at 510 nm) using a spectrofluorometer (Photon Technology International, Brunswick, NJ). Pancreatic islets were isolated from male BALB/c mice weighing 20–25 g. Animals were fedad libitum or fasted overnight before isolation of islets. Islets were isolated according to the collagenase method (19Shibata A. Ludvigsen C.W., Jr. Naber S.P. McDaniel M.L. Lacy P.E. Diabetes. 1976; 25: 667-672Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) with some modification. Pancreas of ether-anesthetized mouse was distended by infusion of HBSS (pH 7.3) containing 1.5 mg/ml Type V collagenase (Sigma) via the common bile duct. After removing destroyed acinar cells by washing with HBSS, intact islets were handpicked with a Pasteur micropipette under a dissecting microscope. For the test of OTC dose dependence in insulin release, islets were incubated with Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate buffer (KRB), pH 7.4, containing 0.01% bovine serum albumin (BSA), 16 mm Hepes, and 2.8 mmglucose for 60 min at 37 °C. After washing with the above buffer, the cells were further incubated with KRB containing 0.01% BSA, 16 mm Hepes, and 5.6 mm glucose in the presence of various doses of OTC for 60 min, and released insulin in the supernatant was measured by radioimmunoassay using an insulin assay kit (Amersham Biosciences, Inc., Buckinghamshire, UK). To evaluate the effect of OTC in the presence of different glucose concentrations, the cells were incubated with KRB containing 0.01% BSA, 16 mm Hepes, and 1 mm OTC in the presence of different glucose concentrations (2.8, 5.6, and 17.5 mm) for 60 min, and released insulin in the supernatant was measured. Islet cells were trypsinized and cultured on polylysine-coated cover glass (MatTek Corporation, Ashland, Massachusetts). The cells were incubated with Fluo-3 AM (20 μm) in KRB solution (pH 7.4) containing 2.8 mm glucose for 30 min at 37 °C. After washing with KRB solution containing 2.8 mm glucose, the cells were incubated with or without 1 mm OTC for 5 min before the addition of 22.2 mm glucose. Fluo-3 fluorescence in the cells was excited at 488 nm from a high power argon laser, and emissions at wavelengths longer than 520 nm were detected by photomultiplier. Confocal microscope (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan) scanned images at 12 frames/min (∼1 image every 5 s). WT and C119K/201E mutant-transfected HeLa cells were incubated with anti-CD38 antibody (1 μg/ml) for 30 min on ice, and the cells were washed with ice-cold HBSS. CD38 ligation was performed by incubation of cells with tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate-labeled F(ab′)2anti-mouse IgG for 0 or 30 min, and then the cells were washed and fixed with 3.7% paraformaldehyde. Both cells were centrifuged onto slides and visualized with confocal microscope (Olympus). WT and CD38 mutant-transfected HeLa cells were incubated with anti-CD38 antibody for 30 min on ice, and the cells were washed with ice-cold HBSS. CD38 ligation was performed by incubation of cells with rabbit anti-mouse IgG F(ab′)2 for 30 min, and then the cells were washed and stained with fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled anti-rabbit IgG and analyzed with FACScan. Antisense oligonucleotide and its sense counterpart synthesized were 5′-TCTTCAGCTCATTTAAGGA-3′ and 5′-ATCTAGAAGTTACACTTG-3′, respectively. Trypsinized islet cells were transfected with oligonucleotide (10 μm) under serum-free conditions for 24 h. After 12 h of exposure to 10% serum, the cells were analyzed with Western blotting and assayed for insulin secretion. Female C57BL/KsJ-db/db mice 7 weeks of age were purchased from Clea Japan (Tokyo, Japan). Mice were maintained in an environmentally controlled room with a 12-h light-dark cycle and were allowed free access to diet and a specific pathogen-free water. For glucose tolerance test, mice were fasted overnight and received single oral administration of various concentrations of OTC (8–80 mg/kg). Five h later, mice were injected with glucose (1 g/kg, intraperitoneally), and blood samples were taken at various time points (0–120 min). Blood glucose levels were measured by the glucose oxidase method using a glucose analyzer (Lifescan, Inc., Milpitas, CA), and serum insulin levels were determined using a radioimmunoassay kit (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.). For the long term effect of OTC, mice received OTC orally two times/day with various concentrations of OTC (0–80 mg/kg/day). At 1, 2, and 4 weeks after OTC administration, mice were fasted overnight and were injected intraperitoneally with glucose (1 g/kg). Blood samples were taken at various time points (0–120 min), and blood glucose levels were measured. Mice were anesthetized with ether, and an abdominal region was incised. Pancreases were then removed from the mice and fixed overnight in a cold 4% paraformaldehyde solution in PBS. Fixed tissues were processed routinely for paraffin embedding, and 5–6-μm sections were used for hematoxylin-eosine or immunohistochemical staining. The tissue sections for detection of insulin were rinsed three times with Tris-buffered saline before conjugation with antibodies. The sections were incubated for 3 h with guinea pig anti-insulin polyclonal antibody or rabbit anti-glucagon polyclonal antibody (DAKO Corp., Carpinteria, CA) diluted 1:50 in Tris-buffered saline containing 1.5% BSA. They were then incubated for 30 min with anti-guinea pig IgG-horseradish peroxidase conjugate (Advanced Biochemicals Inc., Chonju, Korea) as the secondary antibody, and reactivity was detected with 3-amino-9-ethylcarbazole. Nuclei were counterstained with hematoxylin. Positive staining morphology was analyzed using a microscope (Leica, Wetzlar, Germany). We expected that C119K/C201E mutant should have normal or increased intracellular cADPR concentration ([cADPR]i) because the ADP-ribosyl cyclase activity of C119K/C201E mutant was equal to the level of wild type CD38, whereas the cADPR hydrolase activity was lost (Fig.1). However, the cysteine mutant-transfected cells showed completely reduced [cADPR]ias compared with wild type CD38 (Fig. 1). This result led us to speculate that these cysteine residues might play an important role in the internalization of CD38 because CD38 internalization has been proposed as a mechanism by which the ectoenzyme produced intracellular cADPR (20Zocchi E. Usai C. Guida L. Franco L. Bruzzone S. Passalacqua M. De Flora A. FASEB J. 1999; 13: 273-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar): ligation of CD38 with anti-CD38 antibodies has been shown to elicit cellular responses such as the internalization of CD38 and elevation in cytoplasmic Ca2+ (17Han M.K. Cho Y.S. Kim Y.S. Yim C.Y. Kim U.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20799-20805Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Thus, to examine the internalization of CD38 and signaling events that were occurring, we used the CD38 ligation in the transfected cells. When analyzed with FACScan after CD38 ligation with anti-CD38 antibody, the C119K/C201E mutant did not show any internalization of CD38, whereas the wild type completely internalized (Fig.2 a). Next, we measured the [Ca2+]i following CD38 ligation in the Cys-119/201 mutant-transfected HeLa cells. CD38 ligation-induced increase of Ca2+ concentration was completely abolished in the mutant, whereas wild type CD38-transfected cells showed an increase of CD38 ligation-induced Ca2+ (Fig. 2 b). Immunofluorescent confocal microscopic examination revealed CD38 on the cell surface as a ring shape in wild type-transfected cells, and the fluorescence on the cell surface disappeared on ligation of CD38 and appeared as intracellular clusters (Fig. 2 c). On the other hand, C119K/C201E mutant showed no change of CD38 localization after ligation with anti-CD38 (Fig. 2 c). These results suggested that Cys-119 and Cys-201 are essential for the internalization of CD38 to increase Ca2+ concentration by increasing intracellular cADPR. Thus, we measured intracellular cADPR level in the transfected cells before and after the treatment with anti-CD38 antibody and found CD38 ligation-induced increase of [cADPR]i and basal [cADPR]i in wild type-transfected cells, whereas we found complete reduction in the mutant cells (Fig. 2 d). Taken together, our findings suggested that the disulfide bond between Cys-119 and Cys-201 in the CD38 molecule might be involved in the internalization of CD38.Figure 2Abrogation of CD38 internalization, Ca2+ influx, and generation of intracellular cADPR by CD38 ligation in C119K/C201E mutant-transfected cells. WT and C119K/C201E mutant-transfected HeLa cells were incubated with anti-CD38 antibody on ice. CD38 ligation was performed by the incubation of cells with rabbit anti-mouse IgG F(ab′)2, after which cells were washed, stained with fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled anti-rabbit IgG, and analyzed with FACScan (a). The cells were washed and loaded with Fura-2/AM (b). CD38 ligation was performed by the incubation of Fura-2/AM-loaded cells with anti-mouse IgG F(ab′)2 in a quartz cuvette in a thermostatically controlled cell holder. Fluorescence ratios were taken with an alternative time scan method using a fluorometer. Arrows indicate the addition of anti-mouse IgG F(ab′)2. CD38 ligation was performed by incubation of cells with tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate-labeled F(ab′)2 anti-mouse IgG, after which cells were washed and fixed with paraformaldehyde (c). Both WT and mutant cells were centrifuged onto slides and visualized with a confocal microscope. The intracellular cADPR levels were measured (d).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Reduction of the intramolecular disulfide bond formed between the Cys-119 and Cys-201 of CD38 may enhance the possibility of intermolecular disulfide bonding, resulting in dimer formation. Thus, we tested whether C119K or C201E mutation might influence dimer formation because mutants of a single mutation of C119K or C201E mutants still have a single reduced cysteine at 201 or 119. Indeed, C119K or C201E mutants showed dimer formation; however, the C119K/C201E double mutant as well as the wild type did not (Fig.3 a). Next, we tested whether a reducing agent might affect dimerization of CD38, and dithiothreitol was indeed found to increase dimerization of CD38 in a dose-dependent manner in the wild type transfected cells (Fig. 3 b). In contrast, the C119K/C201E mutant did not form any dimer by treatment with the reducing agent (Fig. 3 c). These results suggested that CD38 was dimerized through intermolecular disulfide bond at Cys-119 and Cys-201, which was prerequisite for its internalization. Furthermore, the new intermolecular disulfide bond should specifically be formed between Cys-119 and Cys-119 or between Cys-201 and Cys-201. To test the physiological relevancy of this hypothesis, we examined whether CD38 of isolated pancreatic islets could be dimerized by treatment with reducing agent, and we found that dithiothreitol at 1 mm concentration indeed induced dimerization of CD38 (Fig. 3 d). Moreover, a physiological insulin secretagogue glucose at 25 mm could induce dimerization of CD38 (Fig. 3 d). Thiol compounds such as glutathione have been shown to induce the oligomerization and internalization of CD38 (21Guida L. Franco L. Zocchi E. De Flora A. FEBS Lett. 1995; 368: 481-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), suggesting that disulfide bonds of CD38 play a role in CD38/cADPR/Ca2+ signaling. To test the effect of reducing agent on CD38 internalization, we searched and found an ideal drug for the purpose. OTC, a prodrug of cysteine, is readily absorbed into the body and cleaved into cysteine by a ubiquitous intracellular enzyme, 5-oxoprolinase (22Williamson J.M. Meister A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 936-939Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Thus, intake of a sufficient amount of this drug may increase reducing power in the body, including pancreas (23Meister A. Anderson M.E. Hwang O. J. Am. Coll. Nutr. 1986; 5: 137-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). To test the physiological relevance of the above notion, pancreatic islet cells were employed because cADPR is generated in pancreatic islet cells by glucose stimulation, thereby serving as a second messenger for Ca2+ mobilization to secrete insulin (8Takasawa S. Nata K. Yonekura H. Okamoto H. Science. 1993; 259: 370-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar). Indeed, OTC induced insulin release from isolated mouse islets in a dose-dependent manner in the presence of 5.6 mmol/liter glucose (Fig.4 a). The stimulating effect of OTC (1 mm) was dependent on glucose concentration (Fig.4 b). Interestingly, however, OTC was ineffective on insulin release in the presence of 2.8 mmol/liter glucose (Fig. 4 b). To examine whether CD38 internalization would be increased by the treatment of OTC, we used green fluorescent protein-fusion CD38-transfected HeLa cells. CD38 internalization was clearly increased in the OTC-treated cells in the presence of 5 mm glucose as compared with control cells (Fig. 4 c). Furthermore, OTC-treated islet cells showed higher cytoplasmic Ca2+levels than the control islet (Fig. 4 d). To further substantiate the conclusion that the effect of OTC was mediated via CD38, we constructed CD38 antisense oligonucleotide and tested whether the effects of OTC could be eliminated in CD38 antisense-treated cells. CD38 expression was found to be dramatically suppressed in the CD38 antisense-treated cells as compared with the CD38 sense-treated cells (Fig. 4 e), and the antisense-treated cells showed complete reduction of insulin secretion by the treatment of OTC as well as a reduction in the basal level of insulin (Fig. 4 f). Intraperitoneal glucose tolerance tests performed at 7 weeks of age in C57BL/KsJ-db/db mice after treatment with a single dose of OTC revealed that blood glucose levels were reduced in a dose-dependent manner (Fig.5 a) and that insulin secretion was increased (Fig. 5 b). To investigate the long term effect of OTC, glucose tolerance tests were performed at 8, 9, and 11 weeks of age following 1, 2, and 4 weeks of OTC treatment. Glucose tolerance in those mice after OTC administration was ameliorated (Fig.5 c). Morphological examination of the mice treated with OTC for 4 weeks showed that the islet mass was larger, and insulin contents of the islets were higher in the treated group than those from the control group (Fig. 5 d). Taken together, these data indicated that OTC improved glucose tolerance not only by enhancing insulin secretion but also by protecting pancreatic islets. In this study, we showed that a prodrug of cysteine, OTC, could be used as an antidiabetic agent that induces insulin secretion by a novel mechanism; OTC induces CD38 internalization, thereby producing intracellular cADPR for subsequent Ca2+ signaling. Though physiological ligand(s) for CD38 has yet to be determined, our findings suggest that the cellular reducing system is a physiologic ligand for CD38 to produce intracellular cADPR and to generate intracellular Ca2+ signaling. Ligand-induced internalization of CD38 has been observed in a variety of cells (20Zocchi E. Usai C. Guida L. Franco L. Bruzzone S. Passalacqua M. De Flora A. FASEB J. 1999; 13: 273-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) and has been proven to be associated with cADPR-dependent [Ca2+] increases (17Han M.K. Cho Y.S. Kim Y.S. Yim C.Y. Kim U.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20799-20805Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). A proposed mechanism by which a topological problem of the ectocellular active site of CD38/intracellular localization of cADPR receptor could be overcome was suggested by the demonstration of a specific transport system for NAD in plasma membrane and of CD38 itself as a cADPR transporter (20Zocchi E. Usai C. Guida L. Franco L. Bruzzone S. Passalacqua M. De Flora A. FASEB J. 1999; 13: 273-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 24Franco L. Zocchi E. Usai C. Guida L. Bruzzone S. Costa A. De Flora A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 27: 27Google Scholar). Whatever the mechanism, the prime prerequisite for intracellular production of cADPR by CD38 is its internalization, as shown in this study. Aplysia cyclase was cloned and recombinantly expressed, and its three-dimensional structure was determined (16Prasad G.S. McRee D.E. Stura E.A. Levitt D.G. Lee H.C. Stout C.D. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 957-964Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). The three-dimensional picture predicts that the amino acid residues corresponding to cysteine 119 and cysteine 201 of human CD38 are located on the outer surface of the enzyme, linked by a disulfide bond. This structural finding is consistent with our data showing that cysteine 119 and cysteine 201 of CD38 are essential sites for its internalization and that a reducing agent enhances CD38 internalization. Data on the cysteine mutation with blockages of CD38 internalization and intracellular cADPR production (Fig. 2,c and d) indicated that some reducing power to break the disulfide bond between cysteine 119 and cysteine 201 seemed to be essential for CD38 internalization. This assumption was supported by a finding that GFP-CD38-expressed cells cultured in serum-containing media showed a diffuse fluorescence in cytosol, whereas the cells incubated with serum-free media had fluorescence only on the plasma membrane (data not shown). Although the exact mechanism by which reducing power induces CD38 internalization is yet to be determined, one of the explanations would be that reduction of the cysteine 119-cysteine 201 disulfide bond in a CD38 molecule would favor formation of the intermolecular disulfide bond between different CD38 molecules, producing dimerization (or oligomerization) of CD38 (21Guida L. Franco L. Zocchi E. De Flora A. FEBS Lett. 1995; 368: 481-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Receptor dimerization (or oligomerization) has been well established to be prerequisite for subsequent internalization (25York S.J. Arneson L.S. Gregory W.T. Dahms N.M. Kornfeld S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1164-1171Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), Alternatively, breakage of the disulfide bond between cysteine 119 and cysteine 201 itself may result in a conformational change of CD38 to induce its internalization, as predicted previously from the data of the crystal structure of Aplysia cyclase (16Prasad G.S. McRee D.E. Stura E.A. Levitt D.G. Lee H.C. Stout C.D. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 957-964Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Cysteine is a precursor for the synthesis of glutathione, a major cellular reducing power (26Lu S.C. FASEB J. 1999; 13: 1169-1183Crossref PubMed Scopus (759) Google Scholar). It is generally believed that cysteine is a rate-limiting precursor for GSH synthesis and that intracellular GSH level is regulated by the availability of cysteine. Administration of cysteine is severely restricted because of its rapid oxidation to cystine, which has an extremely low solubility. Cysteine in moderate amounts is also toxic due to the deleterious effect of hydrogen peroxide formed during its oxidation to cystine (27Anderson M.E. Meister A. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 143: 313-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). On the other hand, OTC, a substituted thiazolidine derivative, is apparently nontoxic and is readily transportable into cells where 5-oxoprolinase, a ubiquitous intracellular enzyme, catalyzes ATP-dependent conversion of OTC to l-cysteine (22Williamson J.M. Meister A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 936-939Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). OTC is also a prodrug of cysteine in humans and raises the plasma concentration of cysteine and the intracellular concentrations of cysteine and GSH in lymphocytes of healthy volunteers (28Vita J.A.

Because GSH functions in the reduction of the disulfide linkages of proteins and intracellularly synthesized GSH is transported out of cells to be a main source of plasma glutathione (31Meister A. Science. 1983; 220: 472-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (1096) Google Scholar), reduction of the disulfide bond between cysteine 119 and cysteine 201 of CD38 is expected to be enhanced by increased GSH concentration on the cell membrane as well as in the surrounding environment following the administration of OTC.

In support of the above, OTC might have influenced islet cells through its direct action, as presently shown by the preservation of cell mass and insulin content in islets (Fig.4 d). Nevertheless, our data indicate that the major antidiabetic action of OTC may be attributable to its insulinotropic effect, which reduces blood glucose levels, although we cannot exclude a possibility that the antioxidant may exert its effect directly on target tissues as well as pancreatic islet cells. Therefore, from the above considerations, we suggest that OTC can be of therapeutic use in diabetes by improving glucose tolerance and by reducing glucose toxicity. We thank Dr. T.

One means of exploring this question is to attempt to generate mutant anti-carbohydrate antibodies with higher affinities, either by design of site-directed mutants or by randomizing selected codons in a phage library. However, the production of antibodies with improved affinities that maintain antigen specificity has proven challenging (1Brummell D.A. Sharma V.P. Anand N.N. Bilous D. Dubuc G. Michniewicz J.

For example, in an exhaustive site-directed mutagenesis study of CDR1 H3 of an anti-Salmonella Fab, Brummell et al. (1Brummell D.A. Sharma V.P. Anand N.N. Bilous D. Dubuc G. Michniewicz J. MacKenzie C.R. Sadowska J. Narang S.A. Sigurskjold B.W. Sinnott B. Young N.M. Bundle D.R.

Mutants of the anti-Lewis Y antibody BR96 were obtained as phage-displayed scFv; although the mutant scFv binding affinity had increased by up to 6-foldversus the native antibody, its specificity was altered (2Jeffrey P.D.

More recently, higher affinity antibodies against levan, a model for the polysaccharide capsules of bacteria, were obtained by mutational analysis though their fine specificity varied from that of the parent antibody (5Brorson K. Thompson C. Wei G. Krasnokutsky M. Stein K.E. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 6694-6701PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, significant enhancements have been achieved with antibodies to protein antigens. For example, a mutant scFv of an anti-c-erbB-2 tumor antigen obtained by chain shuffling and phage display had a 5–6-fold increase in affinity (4Schier R. McCall A. Adams G.P. Marshall K.W. Merritt H. Yim M. Crawford R.S. Weiner L.M. Marks C. Marks J.D. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 263: 551-567Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). In a later study by the same group (6Schier R. Bye J. Apell G. McCall A. Adams G.P. Malmqvist M. Weiner L.M. Marks J.D. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 255: 28-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar) sequential mutation of light and heavy chains of the scFv yielded 16- and 9-fold increases in affinity for the protein antigen. Yang et al. (7Yang W.-P. Green K. Pinz-Sweeney S. Briones A.T. Burton D.R. Barbas III, C.F. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 254: 392-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar) obtained mutant anti-HIV-1 Fab by phage-display techniques with a 96-fold increase in binding, even though the native antibody fragments already possessed high affinity for the protein antigen. Though phage-display techniques have been reported to yield higher binding mutant scFvs, the resulting antibodies often contain multiple mutations and have rarely yielded dramatic increases in affinity for carbohydrate antigens. Some of the differences in the behavior of anti-carbohydrate and anti-protein antibodies stem from the fact that these antigens are processed differently by the immune system. Unlike protein antigens, carbohydrate antigens are generally T-cell independent, therefore effectively limiting the B cell response to the production of IgM antibodies. The absence of somatic mutation of the rearranged antibody genes leads to the expression of essentially the germline sequences of these proteins, consequently limiting their affinity. This can be clearly seen in studies (8Wedemayer G.J. Patten P.A. Wang L.H. Schultz P.G. Stevens R.C. Science. 1997; 276: 1665-1669Crossref PubMed Scopus (487) Google Scholar, 9Yang P.L. Schultz P.G. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 294: 1191-1201Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) that compared the free and hapten-bound structures of an anti-peptide antibody 48G7 with its germline predecessor. The germline antibody was shown to bind the antigen with low affinity by an induced fit mechanism, whereas the mature 48G7 antibody possessed a combining site highly complementary to the hapten, leading to a 30,000-fold increase in binding affinity. Many of the amino acid residues mutated in the maturation process were not observed to directly contact the antigen but induced structural changes in the binding domains that resulted in improved binding. This pattern has been seen in other systems (10Hawkins R.E. Russell S.J. Baier M. Winter G. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 234: 958-964Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 11England P. Nageotte R. Renard M. Page A.-L. Bedouelle H. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 2129-2136PubMed Google Scholar) and is consistent with global analyses of the relative contributions of germline and somatic factors to antibody affinity (12Tomlinson I.M. Walter G. Jones P.T. Dear P.H. Sonnhammer E.L.L. Winter G. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 256: 813-817Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar, 13Ignatovich O. Tomlinson I.M. Jones P.T. Winter G. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 268: 69-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). More recently, an in vitro scanning saturation mutagenesis has been described (14Burks E.A. Chen G. Georgiou G. Iverson B.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 412-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) and utilized to examine the changes in specificity associated with changing all important residues in the antigen-binding site of a digoxin-specific scFv (15Chen G. Dubrawsky I. Mendez P. Georgiou G. Iverson B.L. Protein Eng. 1999; 4: 349-356Crossref Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Interestingly, 86% of all mutants retained binding activity, and many of the mutants displayed measurable binding to digoxin analogues, indicating that the mutations resulted in changes in the specificity of the antibody fragment. In a program to explore the concomitant effects of mutation on binding affinity and specificity of anti-carbohydrate antibodies, the ABO blood group antigens were selected as ideal targets. Anti-blood group A and anti-blood group B antibodies are present in persons lacking the corresponding antigen, and the immune response from a mismatched blood transfusion is rapid and can lead to severe complications and death (16Seymour G.J. Savage N.W. Walsh L.J. Immunology: An Introduction for the Health Sciences. McGraw-Hill, Roseville, Australia1995: 109-110Google Scholar). Remarkably, this means that the anti-A and anti-B blood group antibodies are able to unambiguously differentiate between trisaccharide antigens, which differ only in the substitution of an acetamido for a hydroxyl group. As a control of specificity, any mutation in an anti-A or anti-B blood group antibody that yielded higher affinity for its native antigen would be required to show no cross-reactivity with the other antigen. A single-chain Fv (AC1001 scFv) was produced based on the sequence of the anti-blood group A IgM hybridoma AC1001 (17Chen H.-T. Kabat E.A. Lundblad A. Ratcliffe R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 13579-13583Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This type of recombinant polypeptide links the carboxyl terminus of the variable light chain (VL) to the amino terminus of the variable heavy chain (VH) by a peptide linker of sufficient length to bridge this distance (18Bird R.E. Hardman K.D. Jacobson J.W. Johnson S. Kaufman B.M. Lee S.-M. Pope S.H. Riordan G.S. Whitlow M. Science. 1988; 242: 423-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (1323) Google Scholar). The use of scFv avoids the heterogeneous products of proteolysis of the whole antibody as well as problems of association between VH and VLdomains in recombinant protein. Following proteolysis to the Fv, the protein was crystallized (19Patenaude S.I. MacKenzie C.R. Bilous D. To R.J. Ryan S.E. Young N.M. Evans S.V. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 1456-1459Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and its structure was determined. Appropriate mutants were designed into a scFv dimer form based on the three-dimensional structure as well as a phage library of CDR H3 mutants. The binding kinetics of the selected products were determined using surface plasmon resonance, and some of the scFv mutants showed up to a 30-fold increase in antigen binding with no loss of specificity as compared with the wild-type scFv. Crystals of the anti-blood group A Fv were obtained, and the crystallographic data were collected as reported (19Patenaude S.I. MacKenzie C.R. Bilous D. To R.J. Ryan S.E. Young N.M. Evans S.V. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 1456-1459Crossref PubMed Google Scholar); data to 2.2 Å were processed using programs in the CCP4 Suite (20Collaborative Computational Project, Number 4Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19797) Google Scholar). Molecular replacement, refinements, and map calculations were done using the program X-PLOR (21Brünger A.T. X-PLOR Version 3.1: A System for X-ray Crystallography and NMR.. Yale University Press, New Haven, CT1992Google Scholar). The model was visualized and adjusted using the programs FRODO (22Jones T.A. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1978; 11: 268-272Crossref Google Scholar) and SETOR (23Evans S.V. J. Mol. Graphics. 1993; 11: 134-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (1249) Google Scholar). The molecular surface of the anti-A Fv was generated using MS (24Connolly M.L. Quantum Chem. Prog. Exchange Bull. 1981; 1: 75Google Scholar), and the A-trisaccharide antigen was modeled into the Fv-binding site using SETOR. The Fv crystallized in the space group P212121 with cell dimensionsa = 51.7, b = 58.0, andc = 83.6 Å. Data were collected at ambient temperatures on an Enraf-Nonius FAST detector and reduced to a 2.2-Å resolution with an overall merging R-factor of 0.100.

Reflections in the resolution range 15–4.5 Å were used in the rotation and translation function searches. All subsequent structure refinements were done using the X-PLOR program with data in the 6.0–2.2 Å range. The YsT9.1 Fv probe was adjusted using rigid body refinement, and then the domain sequences were changed to those of AC1001 (17Chen H.-T. Kabat E.A. Lundblad A. Ratcliffe R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 13579-13583Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Electron density maps were calculated and then displayed using the program FRODO. Refinement consisted of several rounds of manual intervention alternating with positional refinement and overall B-factor refinement. The overall fit of the model to the electron density was good with only a few instances of discontinuous or ambiguous electron density. The final model consists of 1720 protein atoms and 62 water molecules and refined to a final R-factor of 0.183 (Table I). Coordinates have been deposited to the Protein Data Bank under accession code 1JV5. Generation of the wild-type anti-blood group A scFv gene construct (TGA scFv) has been reported previously (19Patenaude S.I. MacKenzie C.R. Bilous D. To R.J. Ryan S.E. Young N.M. Evans S.V.

PCR mutagenesis was used to construct the site-directed mutant clones listed in TableII. Oligodeoxyribonucleotides containing the appropriate mutations were synthesized on an automated DNA synthesizer model 394 (Applied Biosystems Inc.). The crude oligonucleotides were purified using PAGE as described by Laemmli (27Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207538) Google Scholar). The slowest migrating portion of the band was removed, and the DNA oligonucleotides were eluted from the gel and further purified on a C18 Sep-Pak cartridge (Millipore). Using the TGA scFv wild-type plasmid as template, the pure mutant oligonucleotide primers were used to PCR-amplify the corresponding mutant fragments. Amplification was performed using 30 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s, of 50 °C for 30 s, and of 72 °C for 60 s (PerkinElmer model 9600 thermal cycler). The PCR-amplified mutant fragments were purified, digested with the appropriate restriction enzymes, and ligated into purified TGA scFv vector cut with the same restriction enzymes. The ligated products were then transformed into Escherichia coli TG1-competent cells and screened for the appropriate insert. The sense and antisense strands for the PCR-amplified insert were completely sequenced using an automated DNA sequencer model 373 (Applied Biosystems Inc.) to ensure that the desired mutation was present. Expression of the wild type and mutant scFvs was carried out in E. coli strain TG1 as reported previously (19Patenaude S.I. MacKenzie C.R. Bilous D. To R.J. Ryan S.E. Young N.M. Evans S.V.

Open table in a new tab A library was constructed in which residues 100–103 (Kabat numbering) of the heavy chain were completely randomized, giving 1.6 × 105 possible sequences. Randomization was generated by PCR amplification of the scFv gene from framework 1 of VL to framework 4 of VH using a reverse primer that introduced anApaLI site for cloning into fd-tetGIIID (27Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207538) Google Scholar) and a degenerate forward primer. A second PCR step added a NotI site for inserting the library in fd-tetGIIID. The library was ligated into fd-tetGIIID and electroporated into E. coli TG1, giving 2.3 × 105 transformants. The transformed cells were plated on 2× YT (29Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual.2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) containing 20 μg/ml tetracycline and incubated overnight at 32 °C. The cells were washed off the plates with 2× YT with tetracycline, and following centrifugation, phage were isolated from the supernatant (30Harrison J.L. Williams S.C. Winter G. Nissim A. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 267: 83-109Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For panning, Immuno MaxiSorpTM microtiter plates (Nunc) were coated overnight at 4 °C with 50 μg/ml of BSA-A-trisaccharide (Chembiomed). Wells were washed three times with PBS and then blocked with 5% BSA in PBS for 1 h at room temperature. The BSA was removed, and ∼1010 phage in 200 μl of BSA/PBS were added per well. Following 3 h at room temperature, the wells were washed 10 times with PBS, 10 times with 0.1% Tween 20 in PBS, and finally twice with PBS. Phage were eluted with 0.1 m sodium acetate, pH 2.8, and neutralized with 2 m Tris, pH 9.5. Eluted phage were incubated with log phase E. coli, grown in LB (29Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual.2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar), for 30 min at 37 °C followed by 30 min at room temperature. The cells were then plated, and phage were isolated as described above. Three rounds of panning were performed. The binding kinetics for the interaction of the purified scFv fragments with the A antigen were determined by surface plasmon resonance using BIACORE 2000 or BIACORE 3000 biosensor systems (Biacore AB). Single-chain Fv binding to immobilized BSA-trisaccharide and BSA-B-trisaccharide (Chembiomed) was analyzed using BSA surfaces as a reference. For the analysis of oligosaccharide binding to immobilized scFv in the BIACORE 3000, anti-blood group A scFvs and an scFv specific for an unrelated polysaccharide antigen (31Deng S.-J. MacKenzie C.R. Sadowska J. Michniewicz J. Young N.M. Bundle D.R. Narang S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9533-9538Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) were used as the active and reference surfaces, respectively. Immobilizations were done on research grade CM5 sensor chips in 10 mm sodium acetate, pH 4.5, using the amine coupling kit supplied by the manufacturer. All measurements were performed at 25 °C in 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 3.4 mm EDTA, 0.005% P20 at a flow rate of 20 liters/min. Surfaces were regenerated by washing with analysis buffer. Binding constants were calculated from the association rate and dissociation rate constants where possible or by Scatchard analysis of equilibrium binding. A comparison of the response on the active and control surfaces allowed for the subtraction of bulk effects associated with buffer changes and high analyte concentrations and for the calculation of specific binding. Prior to analysis, all scFv preparations were passed through a Superdex 75 column equilibrated in the BIACORE running buffer. The dimer peaks were collected for binding studies. The structure of the anti-blood group A Fv shows that the CDRs of the VL and VHchains adopt canonical conformations, except CDR H3 for which canonical structures are undetermined. Of these, CDR L1, L2, L3, and H3 interact to form a pronounced pocket on the variable surface of the antibody (Fig. 1). The pocket is V-shaped and 2.8 Å wide at its deepest point, increasing to a width of 4.7 Å at the surface. The antigen-binding site is 11 Å deep and can therefore accommodate the terminal GalNAc of the trisaccharide antigen. The trisaccharide blood group A antigen was manually modeled into this pocket using a conservative approach in that only small movements of glycosidic and side chain dihedral angles were permitted. Overall, the orientation of the model (Fig. 2) was selected to correspond to the shape of the observed binding pocket, and the antigen conformation was based on the structure of the trisaccharide observed in the Dolichos biflorus lectin (32Casset F. Peters T. Etzler M. Korchagina E. Nifant'ev N. Pérez S. Imberty A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 239: 710-719Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The model was used as a predictive tool only, to identify residues that were likely to strongly affect trisaccharide recognition. A number of potential complementary interactions were observed, such as between the Asn-L34 and Tyr-L36 side chains and the hydroxyl groups 3 and 4 of the GalNAc residue of the antigen. The N-acetyl group of the GalNAc was within hydrogen-bonding distance of the side chains of Gln-L89 and Tyr-L36 in the model. Although the object of this modeling study was only to suggest a set of residues for mutation, it also suggested a reasonable basis for differentiation between the A and B antigens in which the hydroxyl group of the latter would be unable to bridge the distance necessary for hydrogen-bonding these groups. The designed mutations were introduced by site-directed mutagenesis into an scFv species with a short linker between the VL and VH domains to create dimeric species whose higher avidity would aid panning and surface plasmon resonance analysis. The same species was used as the template for a phage library construction. With a dissociation constant of 290 μm (19Patenaude S.I. MacKenzie C.R. Bilous D. To R.J. Ryan S.E. Young N.M. Evans S.V. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 1456-1459Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the monovalent scFv-trisaccharide interaction is near the lower limit of the affinity range of BIACORE measurements using the antibody fragment as the analyte or injected molecule. At the surface densities of the BSA-trisaccharide employed, the scFv binding was entirely bivalent. For mutants with measurable dissociation rates, the binding data fit well to a 1:1 interaction model (Fig.3A), indicating that the binding was homogeneous and therefore all bivalent. The rate constants, presented in Table II, for the binding to trisaccharide antigen were derived in this way. Most mutants, including L(103H)V, were tested for binding to BSA-B-trisaccharide, and affinity was observed. In all instances, KD values were derived from Scatchard analyses of equilibrium binding, but only the higher affinity mutants gave data that allowed for the determination ofKD values from rate constants (Table II). TheKD for the bivalent binding of wild-type scFv dimer to trisaccharide antigen was determined to be 26 μm as compared with a value of 290 μm for the binding of Fv monomer to the same antigen (19Patenaude S.I. MacKenzie C.R. Bilous D. To R.J. Ryan S.E. Young N.M. Evans S.V. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 1456-1459Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The L(46L)M, L(46L)N, and N(102H)Q mutations resulted in only marginal improvements in affinity. However, the effects of mutations at residue Leu-H103 were quite dramatic. The L(103H)I and L(103H)V mutations increased theKD for bivalent binding by 15- and 31-fold, respectively, relative to the wild type. The L(103H)I mutation in combination with mutations at positions L46 and H102 resulted in marginal improvements in some instances. Improved binding was primarily attributable to slower dissociation rates with a faster association rate also contributing to the superior performance of L(103H)I (TableII). The true affinities of wild-type and mutant scFvs for trisaccharide and pentasaccharide antigen were determined by binding free monovalent antigen to immobilized scFv (Table II). This method gave aKD of 200 μm for the wild-type scFv-trisaccharide interaction, which is in good agreement with the previously reported value of 290 μm for the binding of Fv to immobilized BSA-A-trisaccharide (19Patenaude S.I. MacKenzie C.R. Bilous D. To R.J. Ryan S.E. Young N.M. Evans S.V. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 1456-1459Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The affinity of wild-type scFv for the pentasaccharide antigen was 3-fold higher, Fig.4. Relative to the wild type, the L(103H)I mutation improved the affinity for trisaccharide and pentasaccharide by ∼2- and 3-fold, respectively. As with scFv dimer binding to immobilized BSA-A-trisaccharide, the L(103H)V mutation led to further 2-fold improvements. A comparison of theKD values for bivalent scFv binding with BSA-A-trisaccharide versus monovalent trisaccharide binding to scFv indicated that the avidity gain afforded by bivalency was ∼75-fold for the L(103H)I and L(103H)V mutants. It should be pointed out that the anomeric configuration of the galactose is locked in the glycoconjugate but not in the free trisaccharide. After three rounds of panning, 21 clones were randomly picked, and all had the scFv insert with sequencing revealing 19 different sequences. All 19 clones were ligated into an expression vector with 11 giving soluble product yields that permitted BIACORE analysis. The sequences and antigen binding activities of these mutants are presented and compared with those of the wild-type svFv and the L(103H)V mutant in TableIII. The sequences of all mutants were very dissimilar to the wild-type sequence with nine clones showing only 25% sequence identity with wild type and the remaining two showing none.Table IIIPhage library mutants: affinities and rate constants for the bivalent binding of anti-blood group A scFvs to BSA-A-trisaccharide and oligosaccharide binding to scFvscFvscFv3-aMolecule (analyte) injected over the sensor chip.Kinetic analysisEquilibrium analysispentasaccharide3-aMolecule (analyte) injected over the sensor chip.trisaccharide3-aMolecule (analyte) injected over the sensor chip.kakdKDKDkdKDKD104m−1s−110−2 s−110−6m10−6ms−110−5m10−5mYGNL3-bThe wild type and mutant sequences are designates according to the amino acid residues at heavy chain positions 100–103 and using the one-letter amino acid codes.(WT)3-cData also presented in Table II.266.920YGNV L(103H)V3-cData also presented in Table II.4.84.00.820.860.31.16.5ELNK0.676.49.56.90.67.5LGTE0.797.08.95.85.1SLDK1.18.37.77.30.61.5HANK2.75.01.81.40.52.538YRHE1.81.91.11.20.63.1KGPT4.75.51.21.30.50.867.7SKQK1.21.10.871.20.62.7SGNK3.02.00.660.660.75.5SANK5.33.10.580.580.52.819YKRT5.53.00.550.580.51.918HGRT4.21.80.430.460.41.33-a Molecule (analyte) injected over the sensor chip.3-b The wild type and mutant sequences are designates according to the amino acid residues at heavy chain positions 100–103 and using the one-letter amino acid codes.3-c Data also presented in Table II. Open table in a new tab Several of the mutants were observed to be superior to the best site-directed mutant, L(103H)V, in terms of bivalent binding to BSA-A-trisaccharide. However, there was not always good correlation between binding of scFv to BSA-A-trisaccharide and free oligosaccharide binding to scFv. For example, whereas SGNK was one of the better mutants in terms of binding to BSA-A-trisaccharide, its affinity for pentasaccharide was only marginally better than that of the wild-type scFv. Mutant HANK displayed enhanced affinity for BSA-A-trisaccharide and pentasaccharide but not trisaccharide. However, the highest affinity mutant in terms of pentasaccharide binding (KGPT) also had higher affinity for trisaccharide. Based on a model of the blood group A-trisaccharide with the AC1001 Fv (Fig. 2), amino acid mutations were proposed that would alter polarity, surface complementarity, and side chain aliphatic character to yield antibody fragments with potentially improved affinity for the trisaccharide epitope. The increase in binding affinity for the N(102H)Q, L(46L)M, and L(46L)N mutants is small (1.2-, 1.4-, and 1.6-fold, respectively, Table II). Much larger increases in affinity were obtained when the leucine at position H103 was mutated to isoleucine, L(103H)I, or valine, L(103H)V, residues; the resulting increases in binding affinities for the Fv mutants were, respectively, 15- and 31-fold that of the wild-type antibody fragment. Although Leu-H103 lines the binding site, its side chain would probably not contact the trisaccharide antigen, and a conservative mutation at this position would not be expected to greatly alter interactions with the antigen. A closer look at the affinities shows that the Leu-Ile-Val progression at position H103 is coupled with a decrease in flexibility of the side chain, indicating a potential entropic component in binding. Typically, higher entropy in the conformation of the binding site residues would be expected to be unfavorable as a thermodynamic penalty would be incurred if antigen binding required residue immobilization. The reduced flexibility of the L(103H)I and L(103H)V mutants thus provides a potential explanation for the increase in binding. Significantly, these scFv mutants did not display detectable binding to the B antigen, demonstrating that the increase in the affinity of the mutant for the blood group A antigen is accompanied by retention of the fine specificity of the native antibody, consistent with the model which suggests that those residues do not contact the acetamido/hydroxyl groups. An attempt was made to produce mutants with even higher affinity by combining the single point mutations into double and triple point mutations. Surprisingly, the L(46L)N/L(103H)I, L(46L)M/L(103H)I, and L(46L)M/N(102H)Q/L(103H)I mutants did not show significant increases in binding affinity over the L(103H)I single mutant, indicating that their respective contributions to binding were not cooperative. In contrast, mutants N(102H)Q/L(103H)I and L(46L)N/N(102H)Q/L(103H)I all display a slight increase in binding affinity over the L(103H)I. Panning the phage library against BSA-A-trisaccharide selected for mutants with enhanced binding to this glycoconjugate, but this did not always result in improved affinity for free pentasaccharide or trisaccharide. These discrepancies are likely due to the locked anomeric configuration of galactose in the glycoconjugate and the pentasaccharide but not in the trisaccharide. Some of the phage mutants may have been selected for improved contacts with these features of the glycoconjugate. There is a great wealth of literature available dealing with the use of phage-display libraries to generate antibody fragments of desired specificity, and so it is significant that in these experiments, much higher increases in affinities were obtained using a rational design approach. Both the site-directed and phage mutation results from AC1001 Fv are in marked contrast to those we obtained previously with another anti-carbohydrate antibody (1Brummell D.A. Sharma V.P. Anand N.N. Bilous D. Dubuc G. Michniewicz J. MacKenzie C.R. Sadowska J. Narang S.A. Sigurskjold B.W. Sinnott B. Young N.M. Bundle D.R. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 1180-1187Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The anti-Salmonellacarbohydrate antibody, Se155–4, was extensively mutated in its CDR H3 by replacing each of the four native residues with all 19 other amino acids, and none of the mutants showed any improvement in oligosaccharide binding (1Brummell D.A. Sharma V.P. Anand N.N. Bilous D. Dubuc G. Michniewicz J. MacKenzie C.R. Sadowska J. Narang S.A. Sigurskjold B.W. Sinnott B. Young N.M. Bundle D.R. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 1180-1187Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Phage-display techniques were then used to modify additional CDR residues, and modest improvements were found for some CDR H2 mutants (30Harrison J.L. Williams S.C. Winter G. Nissim A. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 267: 83-109Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 33Deng S. MacKenzie C.R. Hirama T. Brousseau R. Lowary T. Young N.M. Bundle D.R. Narang S.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4992-4996Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). These effects were attributed to the removal of steric clashes with the extended epitopes in the native lipopolysaccharide. Because the native Se155–4 antibody is an IgG and had a higher initial binding affinity, it is reasonable to propose that the difference in behavior arises from the AC1001 antibody being an IgM of lower affinity, which has undergone little if any somatic mutation. The process of mutating a limited number of amino acids in order to explore questions of affinity and specificity mimics in vitro the process of affinity maturation that antibodies can undergo when challenged with certain classes of antigen. Reducing the conformational flexibility of the antigen-binding site by the somatic mutation of a limited number of residues has been shown to be a key factor in affinity maturation (34Manivel V. Sahoo N.C. Salunke D.M. Rao K.V. Immunity. 2000; 13: 611-620Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar) and antibody affinity (35Sharp K.A. Proteins. 1998; 33: 39-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). This concept extends beyond the paratope as the free and peptide-bound structures of antibody 48G7 and its germline predecessor (8Wedemayer G.J. Patten P.A. Wang L.H. Schultz P.G. Stevens R.C. Science. 1997; 276: 1665-1669Crossref PubMed Scopus (487) Google Scholar) showed that none of the nine mutated amino acid residues in the mature antibody directly contact the antigen but still cooperate in reducing entropic effects. Work is continuing to define residues that will distinguish between the A and the B trisaccharide antigens and on obtaining crystals of the mutant scFvs in complex with antigen. We thank Dr. L. Delbaere for access to an x-ray diffraction area detector."
https://openalex.org/W2092468321,"R67 is a Type II dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) that catalyzes the reduction of dihydrofolate (DHF) to tetrahydrofolate by facilitating the addition of a proton to N5 of DHF and the transfer of a hydride ion from NADPH to C6. Because this enzyme is a plasmid-encoded DHFR from trimethoprim-resistant bacteria, extensive studies on R67 with various methods have been performed to elucidate its reaction mechanism. Here, Raman difference measurements, conducted on the ternary complex of R67.NADP(+).DHF believed to be an accurate mimic of the productive DHFR.NADPH.DHF complex, show that the pK(a) of N5 in the complex is less than 4. This is in clear contrast to the behavior observed in Escherichia coli DHFR, a substantially more efficient enzyme, where the pK(a) of bound DHF at N5 is increased to 6.5 compared with its solution value of 2.6. A comparison of the ternary complexes in R67 and E. coli DHFRs suggests that enzymic raising of the pK(a) at N5 can significantly increase the catalytic efficiency of the hydride transfer step. However, R67 shows that even without such a strategy an effective DHFR can still be designed."
https://openalex.org/W2017271046,"There is a considerable controversy about the postulated role of the Thr671–Leu690(peptide A) region of the dihydropyridine (DHP) receptor α1 II-III loop. Here we report that peptide A introduced the fluorescence probe methyl coumarin acetamido (MCA) in a well defined region of the ryanodine receptor (RyR), A-site, in a specific manner. Depolarization of the T-tubule moiety of the triad induced a rapid increase of the fluorescence intensity of the MCA attached to the A-site. Other RyR agonists, which activate the RyR without mediation of the DHP receptor (e.g. caffeine, polylysine, and peptide A), induced Ca2+ release without producing such an MCA fluorescence increase. Both magnitudes of the fluorescence change and Ca2+ release increased with the increase in the degree of T-tubule depolarization. MCA fluorescence increase at the A-site and subsequent sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ release were blocked by blocking of the DHP receptor-to-RyR communication. These results may be accounted for by two alternative models as follows. (a) Upon T-tubule depolarization a portion of the DHP receptor comes close to the RyR, forming a hydrophobic interface (within such an interface the A-site is located), or (b) T-tubule depolarization may produce a local conformational change in the A-site-containing region of the RyR that is not necessarily within the DHP receptor/RyR junction.

Beam K.G. Powell J.A. Numa S. Nature. 1988; 336: 134-139Google Scholar, 2Tanabe T. Beam K.G. Adams B.A. Niidome T. Numa S. Nature. 1990; 346: 567-569Google Scholar) that replacement of the II-III loop of the cardiac DHP receptor with the skeletal muscle-type sequence conferred the skeletal muscle-type E-C coupling activity in dysgenic myotubes expressing chimeric DHP receptors. According to further studies with chimeras (3Nakai J. Tanabe T. Konno T. Adams B. Beam K.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24983-24986Google Scholar), replacement of the Phe725–Pro742 region of the II-III loop from the cardiac to the skeletal sequence conferred the skeletal type E-C coupling, leading to the proposal that the critical functions required for the skeletal-type E-C coupling are localized in this region (the so-called “determinant”). It was also shown that the skeletal Leu720–Leu764 region (which is approximately identical to our peptide C described below and that contains the determinant region) rescued both skeletal-type orthograde and retrograde communications between the DHP receptor and the RyR (4Grabner M. Dirksen R.T. Suda N. Beam K.G. J..Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21913-21919Google Scholar). In support of the concept that the II-III loop plays the critical role in E-C coupling, a recombinant peptide corresponding to the II-III loop in fact activated the RyR Ca2+ channel in the in vitro system (5Lu X. Xu L. Meissner G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6511-6516Google Scholar). Further studies with shorter peptides suggested that the important functions of E-C coupling are localized in the two different regions of the loop. Namely, the peptides corresponding to the overlapping regions encompassing residues Glu666–Glu726 (6Lu X. Xu L. Meissner G. Biophys. J. 1995; 68 (abstr.): 372Google Scholar) and Thr671–Leu690 (peptide A, Refs. 7El-Hayek R. Antoniu B. Wang J. Hamilton S.L. Ikemoto N. J. Biol.

This suggests that the putative activator of E-C coupling may reside in the peptide A region, although whether the critical activating function is localized in the Arg681–Leu690 region (peptide A-10, Ref. 12El-Hayek R. Ikemoto N. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 7015-7020Google Scholar) or in the Thr671–Glu680 region (13Stange M. Tripathy A. Meissner G. Biophys. J. 2001; 81: 1419-1429Google Scholar) has not yet been settled. Interestingly, peptide C corresponding to the Glu724–Pro760 region of the II-III loop (note that this is essentially identical to the Leu720–Leu764 sequence containing the determinant region described above) inhibited peptide A-mediated activation of the RyR (7El-Hayek R. Antoniu B. Wang J. Hamilton S.L. Ikemoto N. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22116-22118Google Scholar, 14Saiki Y. El-Hayek R. Ikemoto N. J..Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7825-7832Google Scholar) and also produced a moderate inhibition of depolarization-induced tension development in the skinned muscle fiber (15Lamb G.D. El-Hayek R. Ikemoto N. Stephenson D.G. Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2000; 279: 891-905Google Scholar). These results led us to our recent proposal that the voltage-dependent activation and blocking (re-priming) processes of skeletal-type E-C coupling are mediated by alternative binding of the peptide A and the peptide C regions of the II-III loop to the RyR, respectively (14Saiki Y. El-Hayek R. Ikemoto N. J..Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7825-7832Google Scholar, 16Ikemoto N. El-Hayek R. Sugi H. Pollack G.H. Mechanisms of Work Production and Work Absorption in Muscle. Plenum Press, New York1998: 199-207Google Scholar). According to the more recent studies, peptide C (7El-Hayek R. Antoniu B. Wang J. Hamilton S.L. Ikemoto N. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22116-22118Google Scholar, 14Saiki Y. El-Hayek R. Ikemoto N. J..Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7825-7832Google Scholar) and its slightly extended version corresponding to the Leu720–Gln765region (13Stange M. Tripathy A. Meissner G. Biophys. J. 2001; 81: 1419-1429Google Scholar) activate the RyR under certain conditions, suggesting that peptide C can perform either activating or inhibitory function depending upon the conditions. The above view that the peptide A region plays an important role in the activation process of E-C coupling has been questioned by several investigators. According to Proenza et al. (17Proenza C. Wilkens C.M. Beam K.G. J..Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29935-29937Google Scholar), a moderate degree of scrambling of the amino acid sequence in the peptide A-10 region (see above) produced no detectable changes in E-C coupling in the dysgenic myotubes, although the same scrambling produced a severe loss of the activating function of peptide A-10 in case of the in vitro experiments (12El-Hayek R. Ikemoto N. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 7015-7020Google Scholar). Furthermore, according to Wilkens et al. (18Wilkens C.M. Kasielke N. Flucher B.E. Beam K.G. Grabner M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 5892-5897Google Scholar) replacement of the Leu720–Leu764region of the housefly II-III loop, which has the sequence structure highly dissimilar to the skeletal muscle α1S II-III loop, with the skeletal muscle sequence-restored skeletal muscle-type E-C coupling. Furthermore, according to the more recent report of Ahernet al. (19Ahern C.A. Arikkath J. Vallejo P. Gurnett C.A. Powers P.A. Campbell K.P. Coronado R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 6935-6940Google Scholar) deletion of the Thr671–Leu690 peptide A region from the α1 subunit produced virtually no effect on Ca2+ conductance, charge movement, and Ca2+ transients. Thus, the in vivo evidence accumulated so far is inconsistent with the view that the peptide A region may play an active role in the in vivo E-C coupling. To test the physiological significance of the information obtained from the in vitro studies with peptide A, we addressed in this study two key questions as follows. (a) Do these II-III loop peptides, peptide A and peptide C, bind to the RyR in a site-specific manner? (b) Can the fluorescence probe that is attached to the peptide A-binding site or to the peptide C-binding site report the local events that are relevant to the physiological coupling between the DHP receptor and the RyR? As shown in our recent publications (12El-Hayek R. Ikemoto N. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 7015-7020Google Scholar,14Saiki Y. El-Hayek R. Ikemoto N. J..Biol.

Thevenin B.J. Shohet S.B. Ikemoto N. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 3288-3293Google Scholar), the fluorescence conformational probe, MCA, can be incorporated into the designated site on the RyR in a site-specific manner using an appropriate RyR-specific ligand (e.g. the channel blocker, neomycin (14Saiki Y. El-Hayek R. Ikemoto N. J..Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7825-7832Google Scholar, 20Yano M. El-Hayek R. Ikemoto N. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3017-3021Google Scholar), and an agonist of the RyR, polylysine (21Kang J.J. Tarcsafalvi A. Carlos A.D. Fujimoto E. Shahrokh Z. Thevenin B.J. Shohet S.B. Ikemoto N. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 3288-3293Google Scholar)) as a site-directing carrier. Here we report that the site-directed fluorescence labeling technique using peptide A as a site-directing carrier permitted us to introduce the MCA probe into the 160-kDa segment at the C-terminal side of the amino acid residue 1400 of the RyR, indicating that peptide A binds to this region of the RyR in a specific manner. Furthermore, depolarization of the T-tubule moiety of the triad, but not any of chemical/pharmacological agonists of the RyR, produced a rapid increase in the fluorescence intensity of the MCA attached to the peptide A-binding site. The magnitude of the depolarization-induced Ca2+ release was approximately proportional to that of the MCA fluorescence change as determined at various degrees of T-tubule depolarization. Inhibition of T-tubule depolarization and T-tubule-to-RyR signal transmission resulted in the inhibition of both MCA fluorescence change and Ca2+release. Various agonists of the RyR other than T-tubule depolarization, such as caffeine, polylysine, and peptide A, induced Ca2+ release but did not produce any appreciable change in the MCA fluorescence. These results suggest that depolarization in the T-tubule produces dramatic changes either in the DHP receptor/RyR interface or in the cytoplasmic domain of the RyR or both. It is tempting to speculate that the site of peptide A-mediated MCA labeling is localized in the DHP receptor/RyR-interacting interface, but an alternative possibility cannot be excluded that the MCA labeling site is localized in the non-junctional cytoplasmic region of the RyR (cf. Fig. 7 models). Triad-enriched microsomal fractions were prepared from the rabbit back paraspinous and hind leg skeletal muscles by a method of differential centrifugation as described previously (22Ikemoto N. Kim D.H. Antoniu B. Methods Enzymol. 1988; 157: 469-480Google Scholar). Microsomes from the final centrifugation were homogenized in a sample solution containing 0.3 m sucrose, 0.15m potassium gluconate, proteolytic enzyme inhibitors (0.1 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 2.0 μg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor), 20 mm MES, pH 6.8, to a final concentration of 20–30 mg/ml, frozen immediately in liquid N2, and stored at −78 °C. We used two peptides, peptide A and peptide C, corresponding to the Thr671–Leu690 and Glu724–Pro760 regions of the II-III loop of the DHP receptor α1 subunit of the rabbit skeletal muscle, respectively (7El-Hayek R. Antoniu B. Wang J. Hamilton S.L. Ikemoto N. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22116-22118Google Scholar). The peptides were synthesized on an Applied Biosystems model 431A synthesizer employing Fmoc (N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl) as the α-amino-protecting group. The peptides were cleaved and de-protected with 95% trifluoroacetic acid and purified by reversed-phase high pressure liquid chromatography.

Tarcsafalvi A. Carlos A.D. Fujimoto E. Shahrokh Z. Thevenin B.J. Shohet S.B. Ikemoto N. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 3288-3293Google Scholar) in the following way. First, peptide-SAED conjugates were formed by incubating 0.5 mmpeptide with 0.5 mm SAED in 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, for 60 min at 22 °C in the dark. Both peptide A-SAED and peptide C-SAED conjugates retained essentially the same activities as those of the unmodified peptides. The reaction was quenched by 20 mm lysine. Free SAED was removed using Sephadex G15 gel filtration. The peptide-SAED conjugate (5 μm final concentration) was mixed with 2 mg/ml triad protein in the sample solution (see “Preparation” under “Experimental Procedures”) containing 1 mm BAPTA/calcium buffer (1.0 μmfree Ca2+) in the dark, and the mixture was incubated at 4 °C for about 5 min to ensure the access of the peptide-SAED conjugate to the peptide-binding sites. The incubation time of 5 min seemed to be sufficient to introduce the peptide-SAED conjugated to its target site located in the junctional triad, as judged from the fact that this incubation time was sufficient to produce a maximal MCA labeling and a maximal MCA fluorescence response upon T-tubule depolarization. Then, the mixture was photolysed with UV light in a Pyrex tube at 4 °C for 2 min. β-Mercaptoethanol was added (100 mm final concentration) to cleave the disulfide bond of SAED. After incubation on ice for 1 h, the mixture was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 15 min, and the sedimented vesicles were re-suspended in the sample solution to a final protein concentration of ∼20 mg/ml. Gels containing electrophoretically separated protein bands were illuminated with a 360-nm UV lamp through the UG-1 filter (Schott), and the fluorescence images were obtained with a digital camera (Olympus C-2020) using a 440-nm interference filter with 40-nm bandwidth. For digestion with calpain II, fluorescently labeled microsomes (1 mg/ml) were mixed with recombinant calpain II at the ratio of 6 units of calpain to 1 mg of SR protein in a solution containing 150 mm NaCl and 20 mm MOPS, pH 7.2. Digestion was started by adding 3 mm CaCl2. After the digestion for 6 min at 22 °C, the reaction was stopped by adding 3 mm BAPTA. For digestion with trypsin, fluorescently labeled microsomes (1 mg/ml) were mixed with l-1-tosylamido-2-phenylethyl chloromethyl ketone trypsin at the protein/trypsin ratios of 4000:1, 2000:1, 1000:1, 500:1 in a solution containing 150 mm NaCl and 20 mm MOPS (pH7.2) at 22 °C. After digestion for 6 min, the digestion was terminated by adding a 10-fold excess of soybean trypsin inhibitor. To induce Ca2+ release by T-tubule depolarization, we employed the K+ to Na+replacement protocol, which was originally devised in the skinned fiber system by Lamb and Stephenson (23Lamb G.D. Stephenson D.G. J. Physiol. 1990; 423: 495-517Google Scholar) and was adopted to our triad system (24Ikemoto N. Yano M. El-Hayek R. Antoniu B. Morii M. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 10961-10968Google Scholar). The T-tubule moiety (1.0 mg/ml) of the triad was first polarized by incubating in the base solution (150 mm potassium gluconate, 15 mm NaCl, 20 mm imidazole, pH 6.8) containing 5.0 mm MgATP, 100–150 μmCaCl2, and an ATP-regenerating system (2.5 mmphosphoenolpyruvic acid and 10 units/ml pyruvate kinase) for 10 min. Then, the T-tubule moiety was depolarized by mixing in a stopped-flow apparatus (Bio-Logic SFM-4) 30 μl of the solution (solution A) containing the polarized triads with 120 μl of depolarization solution (solution B) having various ionic compositions to produce various degrees of depolarization (see Table I).Table IIonic compositions of polarizing solution (A) and depolarizing solution (B) and those after mixing 1 volume of A and 4 volumes of B (after A + B) for producing various degrees of depolarization (G values) by K+-to-Na+ replacement protocolMagnitude of depolarizationK+Na+Cl−Gluconate−mmG1A1501515150B1501515150After A + B1501515150G3A1501515150B112.552.515150After A + B1204515150G6A1501515150B56.25108.3815150After A + B759015150G9A1501515150B1515015150After A + B3013515150 Open table in a new tab The time course of Ca2+ release was monitored in a stopped flow apparatus (Bio-Logic SFM-4 with MOS-200 optical system; excitation at 440 nm, emission at 510 nm using an interference filter with 40-nm bandwidth) using fluo-3 as a Ca2+ indicator as described previously (14Saiki Y. El-Hayek R. Ikemoto N. J..Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7825-7832Google Scholar, 20Yano M. El-Hayek R. Ikemoto N. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3017-3021Google Scholar, 25El-Hayek R. Yano M. Ikemoto N. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15634-15638Google Scholar). Six to 10 traces (each representing 1,000 data points) of the fluo-3 signal were averaged for each experiment. The fluorescence change of the MCA that had been incorporated to the peptide A- or peptide C-binding site of the RyR in a site-specific fashion (see above) was induced by various degrees of T-tubule depolarization. The time course of the MCA fluorescence change was monitored with the stopped-flow fluorometer (Bio-Logic SFM-4 with MOS-200 optical system: excitation at 368 nm, emission at 455 nm using an interference filter with 70 nm bandwidth) as described previously (14Saiki Y. El-Hayek R. Ikemoto N. J..Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7825-7832Google Scholar, 19Ahern C.A. Arikkath J. Vallejo P. Gurnett C.A. Powers P.A. Campbell K.P. Coronado R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 6935-6940Google Scholar). Ten to 15 traces (each representing 1,000 data points) of the MCA signal were averaged for each experiment. To induce Ca2+ release triggered by several voltage-independent agonists of the RyR as a control, the microsomes (0.4 mg/ml) were incubated in a solution containing 0.15 m potassium gluconate, 1 mmMgATP, 40–50 μm CaCl2, 20 mmMES, pH 6.8, for 5 min for active Ca2+ loading. Then one volume of the above solution was mixed with one volume of a release solution containing 0.15 m potassium gluconate, 5.0 μm fluo-3, 20 mm MES, pH 6.8, and various agonists (peptide A, polylysine, and caffeine). The time course of SR Ca2+ release was monitored in a stopped flow apparatus using fluo-3 as a Ca2+ indicator as described previously (25El-Hayek R. Yano M. Ikemoto N. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15634-15638Google Scholar). Six to 10 traces (each representing 1,000 data points) of the fluo-3 signal were averaged for each stopped-flow measurement. Several such measurements (n = 3–5) were repeated for each experiment shown in the figure. The time courses of fluorescence change of the protein-bound MCA upon mixing with various RyR agonists were monitored with the stopped-flow fluorometer as described previously (25El-Hayek R. Yano M. Ikemoto N. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15634-15638Google Scholar). Ten to 15 traces (each representing 1,000 data points) of the MCA signal were averaged for each experiment. The time courses of MCA fluorescence change and Ca2+ release were fitted by the equation: y = A(1-exp(−kt)), where A is the maximum amount of Ca2+ release, k is the rate constant of Ca2+ release, t is reaction time, andAk is the initial rate of Ca2+ release since (dy/dt)t=0 =A*k. Unpaired t test was employed to determine the statistical significance. In our recent studies (12El-Hayek R. Ikemoto N. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 7015-7020Google Scholar, 14Saiki Y. El-Hayek R. Ikemoto N. J..Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7825-7832Google Scholar, 20Yano M. El-Hayek R. Ikemoto N. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3017-3021Google Scholar,24Ikemoto N. Yano M. El-Hayek R. Antoniu B. Morii M. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 10961-10968Google Scholar), we incorporated the conformation-sensitive fluorescent probe MCA into the trans-membrane channel domain using the Ca2+channel blocker neomycin as a site-directing carrier and monitored conformational changes in the channel domain induced by various types of RyR agonists. In the present study, we introduced the MCA probe into the putative II-III loop binding region of the RyR using peptide A and peptide C as site-directing carriers. For this purpose, the triad-enriched SR fraction was incubated with the SAED-peptide A or the SAED-peptide C conjugate (azido-MCA-S-S-peptide A or azido-MCA-S-S-peptide C) followed by photo-cross linking of the conjugate with the triad via the azido group. Then peptide A or peptide C (site-directing carrier) was removed from the cross-linking site by cleaving the S-S bond of SAED, leaving the MCA that had been covalently attached to the cross-linked site (details are provided under “Experimental Procedures”). Fig. 1A depicts Coomassie Blue staining, Western blot, and MCA fluorescence-labeling patterns of the electrophoretically separated protein bands of the triad-enriched SR preparation that has been subjected to the site-directed MCA labeling by mediation of peptide A or peptide C. Fig. 1Aalso contains the set of staining patterns of the sample that was labeled with MCA first and then digested with calpain II. The corresponding pictures of the undigested sample (−calpain) and digested sample (+calpain) are arranged side by side to facilitate the comparison. As seen in lane 9 (peptide A) and lane 11 (peptide C), the MCA fluorescence is associated almost exclusively with the 550-kDa band in both cases when the MCA labeling has taken place by mediation of peptide A and peptide C. The MCA-labeled 550-kDa band was identified as the RyR protein by immuno-staining with the RyR-specific polyclonal antibody (lane 3). The result indicates that both peptide A and peptide C have bound specifically to the RyR moiety out of numerous proteins present in the triad preparation. As shown in Fig. 1B, photolysis of the mixture of the triads and the peptide-SAED conjugate in the presence of an excess amount of unmodified peptide (cold chase experiment) resulted in a considerably reduced amount of MCA incorporation (for the quantities and statistics, see the legend to Fig. 1B). This suggests that the peptide-SAED conjugate bound to the same site as the unmodified peptide bound and that the sites of the peptide-mediated MCA labeling basically represent the sites of the peptide binding. To localize the sites of MCA labeling (i.e. the sites of binding of peptide A and peptide C) in the primary structure of the RyR, the MCA-labeled RyR was cleaved at the residue 1400 (26Wu Y. Aghdasi B. Dou S.J. Zhang J.Z. Liu S.Q. Hamilton S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25051-25061Google Scholar) with calpain II, which produced ∼150 and ∼400 kDa fragments (Fig.1A, lane 2). The 150- and 400-kDa fragments must have originated from the N- and C-terminal segments of the RyR, respectively, because the former was stained with anti-residue 416 antibody (Fig. 1A, lane 6), but the latter was stained with anti-residue 5029 antibody (Fig. 1A, lane 8). Interestingly, the MCA fluorescence was found almost exclusively in the 400-kDa calpain fragment if the MCA labeling was mediated by peptide A (Fig. 1A, lane 10). If the MCA labeling was mediated by peptide C, however, the MCA fluorescence was found almost exclusively in the 150-kDa fragment (Fig.1A, lane 12). Tryptic digestion cleaved the RyR more extensively, producing shorter fragments (Fig. 2). In this figure, MCA-labeling patterns were compared with Western blot patterns obtained with various site-specific anti-RyR monoclonal antibodies. In case of peptide A-mediated labeling (upper panel), after relatively extensive digestion, the major intensity of MCA fluorescence was localized in a 160-kDa tryptic sub-fragment. Because this sub-fragment was stained with anti-residue 1417 antibody (Ab 1417) but not with anti-residue 2727 antibody (Ab 2727), the peptide A-mediated MCA labeling site, i.e. peptide A-binding site, seemed to be localized in the region of the RyR encompassing residues 1400–2726, as illustrated at the bottom of Fig. 2. There is an additional lower molecular mass (145 kDa) tryptic sub-fragment labeled with MCA that matches approximately with the band intensely stained with anti-residue 416 antibody (Ab 416). We assume that the 145-kDa fluorescent sub-fragment has derived not from the N-terminal 150-kDa calpain fragment but from the 160-kDa (peptide A binding region) tryptic sub-fragment described above for the following reasons. First, the molecular mass of the Ab 416-stained band (150 kDa) was always higher than that of the 145-kDa MCA-labeled sub-fragment. Second, not even a trace of MCA labeling was detected in the 150-kDa N-terminal region of the RyR, as described in Fig. 1A. The lower panelof Fig. 2 shows the result of similar site-localization experiments with peptide C-mediated MCA labeling. In this case, the MCA-labeling site was localized in the 150-kDa sub-fragment that was stained with anti-residue 416 antibody (Ab 416) after a partial tryptic digestion. After more extensive digestion, the shortest fluorescent sub-fragment was a 100-kDa subfragment that was stained intensely with Ab 416, indicating that peptide C binds the 100-kDa region of the N-terminal segment as indicated in the diagram at the bottom of Fig. 2. The above results suggest that both II-III loop peptides, peptide A and peptide C, bind exclusively to the RyR moiety out of many proteins present in the triad preparation. However, peptide A and peptide C introduced the fluorescence MCA probe to the clearly distinguishable regions of the RyR. Thus, it is concluded that peptide A and peptide C bind to the RyR in protein-specific and domain-specific manners. Although it may well be that the peptide binding domain actually consists of a multiple number of binding sites distributed in the different places of the primary structure, to facilitate discussion these distinguished regions will be called A-site (peptide A-binding site) and C-site (peptide C-binding site), respectively. The MCA-labeled triad preparation by mediation of either peptide A or peptide C showed almost intact activity of depolarization-induced Ca2+ release as the unlabeled preparation, although there was a significant decrease in the rate of depolarization-induced Ca2+ release; at G9, 60.01 ± 11.9 nmol/mg/s (n = 4) in the MCA-labeled triads (see Table II) versus 435.8 ± 73.9 nmol/mg/s (n = 5) in the case of the unlabeled triads (cf. Ref. 14Saiki Y. El-Hayek R. Ikemoto N. J..Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7825-7832Google Scholar). Therefore, the labeled triads can serve as a useful in vitro model of E-C coupling. We examined whether any of these activators produce appreciable changes in the fluorescence intensity of the MCA that had been incorporated into either the A or C site on the RyR in a protein-specific manner. We found that depolarization of the T-tubule moiety of the triad induced a rapid increase in the fluorescence intensity of the MCA bound to the A-site but no appreciable change in the MCA bound to the C-site.Table IIKinetic parameters of MCA fluorescence change (A, the amount of fluorescence change; k, the rate constant of fluorescence change; Ak, the initial rate of fluorescence change) and Ca2+ release (A, the amount of Ca2+ released; k, the rate constant of Ca2+ release; Ak, the initial rate of Ca2+ release) induced by various magnitude of T-tubule depolarization (upper part of the table) and those induced by T-tubule depolarization (G9) in the presence of nomodipine or ionophores (lower part"
