https://openalex.org/W2027484375,"A novel coronavirus has been identified as the causative agent of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). The viral main proteinase (M pro , also called 3CL pro ), which controls the activities of the coronavirus replication complex, is an attractive target for therapy. We determined crystal structures for human coronavirus (strain 229E) M pro and for an inhibitor complex of porcine coronavirus [transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV)] M pro , and we constructed a homology model for SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) M pro . The structures reveal a remarkable degree of conservation of the substrate-binding sites, which is further supported by recombinant SARS-CoV M pro -mediated cleavage of a TGEV M pro substrate. Molecular modeling suggests that available rhinovirus 3C pro inhibitors may be modified to make them useful for treating SARS."

https://openalex.org/W1982245868,"Organisms generally respond to iron deficiency by increasing their capacity to take up iron and by consuming intracellular iron stores. Escherichia coli, in which iron metabolism is particularly well understood, contains at least 7 iron-acquisition systems encoded by 35 iron-repressed genes. This Fe-dependent repression is mediated by a transcriptional repressor, Fur (ferric uptake regulation), which also controls genes involved in other processes such as iron storage, the Tricarboxylic Acid Cycle, pathogenicity, and redox-stress resistance. Our macroarray-based global analysis of iron- and Fur-dependent gene expression in E. coli has revealed several novel Fur-repressed genes likely to specify at least three additional iron-transport pathways. Interestingly, a large group of energy metabolism genes was found to be iron and Fur induced. Many of these genes encode iron-rich respiratory complexes. This iron- and Fur-dependent regulation appears to represent a novel iron-homeostatic mechanism whereby the synthesis of many iron-containing proteins is repressed under iron-restricted conditions. This mechanism thus accounts for the low iron contents of fur mutants and explains how E. coli can modulate its iron requirements. Analysis of 55Fe-labeled E. coli proteins revealed a marked decrease in iron-protein composition for the fur mutant, and visible and EPR spectroscopy showed major reductions in cytochrome b and d levels, and in iron-sulfur cluster contents for the chelator-treated wild-type and/or fur mutant, correlating well with the array and quantitative RT-PCR data. In combination, the results provide compelling evidence for the regulation of intracellular iron consumption by the Fe2+-Fur complex.

In combination, the results provide compelling evidence for the regulation of intracellular iron consumption by the Fe2+-Fur complex. Iron is an essential minor element for most organisms, playing vital roles in many important biological processes including photosynthesis, N2 fixation, methanogenesis, H2 production, and consumption, respiration, the TCA 1The abbreviations used are: TCA, Tricarboxylic Acid Cycle; Tricine, N-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycine; Fur, ferric uptake regulation; EPR, electron paramagnetic resonance.1The abbreviations used are: TCA, Tricarboxylic Acid Cycle; Tricine, N-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycine; Fur, ferric uptake regulation; EPR, electron paramagnetic resonance. cycle, oxygen transport, and DNA biosynthesis. However, despite the indispensability of iron, it is also potentially toxic due to its tendency to catalyze free radical generation. In addition, the extremely poor solubility of the oxidized, ferric form leads to bioavailability problems (1Andrews S.C. Adv. Microb. Physiol. 1998; 40: 281-351Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Organisms counter the difficulties posed by iron nutrition in a number of ways. One common mechanism involves the solubilization of extracellular iron, by reduction or chelation, followed by internalization via specific transporters. Another widespread approach is the deposition of intracellular iron stores within ferritin molecules that can be subsequently utilized to abrogate the effects of iron restriction (1Andrews S.C. Adv. Microb. Physiol. 1998; 40: 281-351Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Guerinot M-L. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1994; 48: 743-772Crossref PubMed Scopus (524) Google Scholar). Iron metabolism in Escherichia coli K-12 is particularly well studied making it a model organism for investigations on iron-homeostatic processes. Like other bacteria, as well as fungi and some plants, it utilizes high-affinity extracellular ferric-chelators, called siderophores, to solubilize iron prior to transport (3Earhart C.F. Neidhardt F.C. Escherichia coli and Salmonella: Cellular & Molecular Biology. 2nd Ed. ASM Press, Washington, D. C.1996: 1075-1090Google Scholar). Ferri-siderophore complexes are taken up via specific outer membrane receptors in a process that is driven by the inner membrane potential and mediated by the energy-transducing TonB-ExbB-ExbD system. Periplasmic-binding proteins shuttle ferri-siderophores from the receptors to inner membrane ABC transporters that, in turn, deliver the ferri-siderophores to the cytosol where the complexes are probably dissociated by reduction. E. coli has six known siderophore receptors (Cir, FecA, FepA, FhuA, FhuE, Fiu) providing specificity for several ferri-siderophores (and ferric dicitrate) of which only enterobactin and its derivatives are synthesized endogenously (4Hantke K. Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 2001; 4: 172-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (566) Google Scholar). It also possesses three ferri-siderophore periplasmic-binding protein-dependent ABC-transporter systems, FecBCDE, FepBCDEFG, and FhuBCD, and, like many other bacteria, can take up ferrous iron anaerobically via FeoB. In addition, E. coli contains three iron storage proteins (Bfr, FtnA, and FtnB) of which FtnA plays the major storage role (5Abdul-Tehrani H. Hudson A.J. Chang Y-S. Timms A.R. Hawkins C. Williams J.M. Harrison P.M. Guest J.R. Andrews S.C. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 1415-1428Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Not surprisingly, the iron acquisition and storage systems are regulated in response to iron availability. This regulation is mediated by the homodimeric repressor protein, Fur, which employs ferrous iron as co-repressor (4Hantke K. Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 2001; 4: 172-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (566) Google Scholar). There is evidence that the Fe2+-Fur complex also represses genes (cyoA, flbB, fumC, gpmA, metH, nohB, purR, and sodA) involved in various non-iron functions (respiration, flagella chemotaxis, the TCA cycle, glycolysis, methionine biosynthesis, phage-DNA packaging, purine metabolism, and redox-stress resistance) so it can thus be considered to be a global regulator (6Stojiljkovic I. Bäumler A.J. Hantke K. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 236: 531-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar, 7Park S.J. Gunsalus R.P. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 6255-6262Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 8Vassinova N. Kozyruv D. Microbiol. 2000; 146: 3171-3182Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 9Touati D. J. Bacteriol. 1988; 170: 2511-2520Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Fe2+-Fur represses transcription by binding to a 19-bp sequence, designated the “iron box,” normally located near the Pribnow box of cognate promoters. Fur can also act as a transcriptional activator switching on genes encoding the iron-containing proteins aconitase A, Bfr, FtnA, fumarases A and B, succinate dehydrogenase, and superoxide dismutase B (7Park S.J. Gunsalus R.P. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 6255-6262Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 10Tseng C-P. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1997; 157: 67-72Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11Massé E. Gottesman S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 4620-4625Crossref PubMed Scopus (854) Google Scholar). This activation appears to be indirect and seems to involve (at least in some cases) the Fe2+-Fur repressed regulatory RNA, RyhB (11Massé E. Gottesman S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 4620-4625Crossref PubMed Scopus (854) Google Scholar). Here we use transcriptional profiling to extend the Fur modulon of E. coli. Over 100 Fe2+-Fur-regulated genes were detected, most of which have not been previously reported. These include unknown genes potentially involved in iron acquisition. A large number of energy metabolism genes, mainly encoding Fe-containing respiratory complexes, were found to be Fe2+-Fur induced. This represents a major new functional category for inclusion within the Fur modulon. 55Fe-labeling studies and whole-cell spectroscopy showed that fur mutants are deficient in iron-containing proteins. Together, the data provide an explanation for the low iron contents of fur mutants and reveal a new Fur-dependent mechanism for iron homeostasis. Bacterial Strains and Culture Conditions—E. coli strains were grown in Luria-Bertani (L broth) medium (12Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual, 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press. Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) at 37 °C and shaken at 250 rpm in an orbital shaker. Iron limitation was induced by inclusion of the ferrous iron chelator 2,2′-dipyridyl (dip) at 200 μm. RNA Isolation, Preparation of Radiolabeled cDNA, and Real-Time RT-PCR—Cultures of E. coli wild-type (MC4100), wild-type with dip and an E. coli fur mutant (H1941: MC4100 fur) were grown to an OD650 nm of 1.0 (six replicates for each condition). A 1-ml sample from each culture was harvested by centrifugation and total RNA extracted using the Qiagen RNeasy® kit. RNA was treated with RNase-free DNase I (Promega). Each set of six replicate samples was pooled into two groups of three to control for slight growth and extraction variations. Pooled total RNA samples were then used as templates for production of 33P-labeled cDNA using random hexaprimers (Promega), and the labeled cDNA probes purified using G25-Sephadex columns, as described by Sigma-Genosys. Quantitative RT-PCR was performed using an ABI 5700, the Sybr Green RT-PCR kit (Qiagen) and primers designed to amplify 50–80-bp fragments. Specificity was confirmed by electrophoretic analysis of the reaction products and by inclusion of template or reverse-transcriptase free controls. The template RNA samples were prepared separately from those used for macroarray analysis. Macroarray Hybridization and Scanning—Labeled cDNA was hybridized independently to two Panorama™ E. coli gene arrays (Sigma-Genosys) essentially as described by the manufacturer. Hybridized and washed arrays were then exposed to low intensity phosphorimaging cassettes (Molecular Dynamics) for 45 h and the cassettes were then scanned with a Phosphoimager SI system (Molecular Dynamics) at 200-μm resolution. Filters were stripped prior to re-use as described by the manufacturer. Data Analysis—The phosphoimager image files were analyzed using ImageQuant software (Molecular Dynamics). Pixel intensities for each spot were manipulated using Microsoft Excel. The 632 blank spots were used to calculate the background, which was then subtracted from the 8580 gene-specific spots (each gene present in duplicate). Spots with intensities less than two standard deviations above mean background values were considered to display no significant expression. The intensity of each of the gene-specific spots within an individual array was normalized by expressing values as percentages of total gene-specific spot intensity. This allowed comparisons between array experiments. Array experiments were performed in duplicate, and average values calculated along with confidence levels (Student's t test values). Whole Cell Spectroscopy—E. coli wild type (MC4100) and fur mutant (MC4100 fur) were grown aerobically in L broth, with or without 200 μm dip, to mid-log (OD650, 0.5), late-log (OD650, 1.0), and stationary phase (OD650, 3.0). Cells were harvested by centrifugation and 0.5 g of wet cells were resuspended in 10 ml of 0.1 m phosphate buffer (pH 7). Samples of 4 ml were oxidized with 0.005% (w/v) potassium ferricyanide and 0.005% (w/v) ammonium persulfate or were reduced with 0.005% (w/v) sodium dithionite. Spectra were then recorded at room temperature using a dual beam spectrophotometer over a wavelength range of 400–700 nm, with a reference wavelength of 500 nm (13Kalnenieks U. Galinina N. Bringer-Meyer S. Poole R.K. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1998; 168: 91-97PubMed Google Scholar). Cytochrome d- and b-type cytochrome levels were quantified as previously described (14Jones C.W. Redfearn E.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1966; 113: 467-481Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 15Kita K. Konishi K. Anraku Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 3369-3374Google Scholar). Prior to whole cell EPR spectroscopy, cells were washed in 0.1 mm phosphate buffer (pH 7) containing 50 mm EDTA in order to remove Mn from the cell surface. Half of each sample was reduced by the addition of 0.005% (w/v) sodium dithionite followed by repetitive freeze-thawing. The EPR spectra were measured at 10 K on a Bruker EMX EPR spectrometer equipped with an Oxford Instruments liquid helium system. A spherical high quality Bruker resonator SP9703 was used. The EPR samples were frozen in Wilmad SQ EPR tubes. Measurements were as follows: microwave power, 3.18 milliwatts; microwave frequency, 9.46 GHz; modulation frequency, 100 kHz; modulation amplitude, 3 G; sweep rate, 3.58 G/s; time constant, 0.082 s. Protein concentrations were determined as previously described (16Markwell M.A.K. Haas S.M. Bieber L.L. Tolbert N.E. Anal. Biochem. 1978; 87: 206-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (5279) Google Scholar). Native Gel Electrophoresis of 55Fe-labeled Soluble E. coli Proteins—E. coli cultures were grown in 5 ml of L broth containing 55FeC13 (∼0.5 MBq/ml). Cells (5 OD650 nm units) were harvested by centrifugation in the postexponential phase and washed in saline at 4 °C. Soluble cell extracts were then prepared by the spheroplast osmotic lysis method (17Philips-Jones M.K. Watson F.J. Martin R. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 233: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) with the following modifications. Tricine was used in place of Tris, dithiothreitol was omitted, 0.1% Triton X-100 was included at the lysis stage and glycerol was added postlysis to a final concentration of 5%. Soluble cell extracts were electrophoresed in native-acrylamide gels containing 0.1% Triton X-100 and Tricine in place of Tris. Gels were then dried under vacuum and autoradiographed with Kodak Biomax MS film. Identification of Fe2 + -Fur-regulated Genes by Transcriptional Profiling—Genomic transcriptional profiling was used to identify genes regulated by both Fe and Fur (see “Materials and Methods”). The transcription profile of MC4100 (wild-type) grown in rich broth was compared with those of both the wild-type grown with an Fe2+ chelator (dip) and the fur mutant (MC4100 fur) grown without chelator. Samples were harvested at an OD650 nm of 1.0, corresponding to early postexponential phase. No major growth differences were observed for the three experimental conditions. 33P-labeled cDNA was prepared from the RNA samples using reverse transcriptase and random hexaoligonucleotides, and was hybridized to E. coli Panorama Macroarrays. Each array experiment was performed in duplicate using pooled RNA samples prepared from three identical cultures. Duplicate experiments gave good reproducibility with correlation coefficients of 0.97. Comparison of the L broth versus L-broth plus dip, or wild-type versus fur mutant, gave lower correlation coefficients (0.95 and 0.90). Since members of the Fur modulon are regulated by iron and Fur in conjunction, only those genes that were ≥2-fold regulated by both dip and the fur mutation are considered further here. Accordingly, 101 genes were found to be regulated by the Fe2+-Fur complex of which 53 were repressed and 48 induced. These genes fall into three major categories: iron metabolism (Table I), energy production (Table II), and miscellaneous/unknown (Table IV).Table IIron and Fur regulation of genes involved in iron metabolismTable IIIron- and Fur-regulated genes involved in energy metabolismTable IIIron- and Fur-regulated genes involved in energy metabolismTable IVMiscellaneous iron- and Fur-regulated genesTable IVMiscellaneous iron- and Fur-regulated genes Iron Metabolism: Potential Novel Iron Transporters—Reassuringly, most of the known iron-acquisition genes were induced by both the chelator and the fur mutation (Table I) validating the experimental procedure. The enterobactin biosynthesis (entA–F) genes were among the most highly de-repressed (average ∼21-fold) genes (Table I), presumably to ensure that energy is not needlessly squandered on enterobactin production during conditions of iron sufficiency. In contrast, the ferric-enterobactin uptake genes (fepABCDEG) were weakly de-repressed (average ∼2-fold) indicating that enterobactin production systems are more strongly controlled by iron than the ferri-enterobactin acquisition apparatus. As previously observed, the fecIRABCDE, feoAB, fhuE, fhuF, and cirA genes involved in ferric-dicitrate, ferrous iron, ferri-coprogen/rhodotorulic acid, ferrioxamine B, and ferric-dihydroxybenzoate utilization were all repressed by the Fe2+-Fur complex, as were the tonB and exbBD genes required for energy-dependent ferrisiderophore transfer across the outer membrane. However, the fhuACDB operon, specifying the ferric hydroxamate uptake apparatus, was not significantly affected by the chelator or fur mutation although it is known that fhuA-lacZ transcriptional fusions are Fe2+-Fur regulated (19Hantke K. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1981; 182: 288-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar). The reason for this discrepancy is unclear, but could be related to growth-phase effects. The suf operon, which probably functions in iron-sulfur cluster assembly during iron starvation and redox stress (20Zheng M. Wang X. Templeton L.J. Smulski D.R. LaRossa R.A. Storz G. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 4562-4570Crossref PubMed Scopus (647) Google Scholar), was also Fe2+-Fur repressed (average of 5-fold), as previously indicated (21Patzer S.I. Hantke K. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 3307-3309Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, the iscSUA-hscBA-fdx cluster, which encodes genes with a housekeeping role in iron-sulfur cluster assembly, was not Fe2+-Fur controlled (not shown). Appropriately, the bfd gene encoding a ferredoxin thought to be involved in iron release from bacterioferritin, was de-repressed (22Quail M.A. Jordan P. Grogan J.M. Butt J.N. Lutz M. Thomson A.J. Andrews S.C. Guest J.R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 229: 635-642Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) whereas the ftnA gene specifying the iron-storage protein, ferritin A, was repressed by the chelator and fur mutation, as previously observed (5Abdul-Tehrani H. Hudson A.J. Chang Y-S. Timms A.R. Hawkins C. Williams J.M. Harrison P.M. Guest J.R. Andrews S.C. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 1415-1428Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11Massé E. Gottesman S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 4620-4625Crossref PubMed Scopus (854) Google Scholar). A significant absentee from the list of genes in Table I is bfr, coding for bacterioferritin. Although this gene is known to be Fe2+-Fur induced, its expression is RpoS dependent and so is restricted to the stationary phase. 2J. Grogan and S. C. Andrews, unpublished observations. Thus, the array data are generally consistent with numerous previous expression studies on the Fur-regulated components of iron metabolism. The array analysis enabled the identification of several unknown genes with potential functions in iron acquisition (Table I). These were initially recognized either because of their chelator- and fur-dependent expression or by their chromosomal co-location with such genes. They are organized into 6 clusters (boxed in Table I), of which the largest (ybiM-ybiLXI-ybiJ) consists of 5 co-polar genes encoding: YbiM and YbiJ, two putative-periplasmic/exported proteins that are related to each other, but not to any other E. coli protein; YbiL (or Fiu), a probable TonB-dependent outer membrane receptor previously shown to be involved in Fe3+-dihydroxybenzoylserine and -dihydroxybenzoate utilization (23Hantke K. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1990; 67: 5-8Google Scholar); YbiX, a homologue of a protein encoded by an Fe-repressed Pseudomomas aeruginosa gene (piuC) thought to be involved in iron uptake (24Ochsner U.A. Vasil M.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 4409-4414Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar); and YbiI, a probable C4-Zn finger protein of unknown function. The above suggests that the Fiu-mediated Fe-uptake system is more complex than hitherto believed. The second cluster (ycdN-ycdOB) consists of three copolar genes encoding: YcdN, a homologue (24% amino acid sequence identity) of the high-affinity ferrous iron transporter (Ftr1p) of yeast; YcdO, a potential exported lipoprotein of unknown function; and YcdB, another potentially exported protein of unknown function. A twin arginine transporter (tat) motif was previously identified in the N terminus of YcbB (25Stanley N.R. Findlay K. Berks B.C. Palmer T. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 139-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar), and a similar motif is present in the N terminus of YcdO. This suggests, as for many other tat-exported proteins, that these proteins could possess prosthetic groups inserted prior to export to the periplasm. Homologues of the ycdNOB genes are found co-located in the chromosomes of at least 7 other bacteria indicating that these 3 genes form a functional unit. YcdB bears homology to STY2683 of Salmonella typhimurium, a putative iron-dependent peroxidase. By analogy with the yeast Ftr1p system (26Stearman R. Yuan D.S. Yamaguchi-Iwai Y. Klausner R.D. Dancis A. Science. 1996; 271: 1552-1557Crossref PubMed Scopus (570) Google Scholar), we speculate that YcdN acts as a ferrous iron transporter, and that YcdO and YcdB act together as a novel periplasmic iron oxidase or reductase (this possibility is currently being tested). The third cluster consists of three genes, yddAB-pqqL, that appear to form an operon encoding: YddA, which is homologous to ABC transporters; YddB, homologous to TonB-dependent outer membrane receptors; and PqqL, a potential Zn peptidase (pqqL is also induced by iron restriction in Pasteurella multocia; 45Paustian M.L. May B.J. Kapur V. Infect. Immun. 2001; 69: 4109-4115Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). These genes are likely to specify a new 3-component iron-uptake system. The fourth cluster is also likely to represent a newly identified iron-uptake pathway. It consists of two divergently arranged genes encoding: YcnD, a probable TonB-dependent outer membrane receptor; and YncE, which is predicted to be a pyrolo-quinoline quinone containing periplasmic oxidase. Note that all four of the above Fe2+-Fur repressed gene clusters are associated with predicted Fur boxes. The fifth locus consists of a single gene (ydiE) that is related (36% identity at the amino acid sequence level) to hemP, a gene that forms part of the heme utilization operon (hemPRST) of Yersinia enterocolitica (27Stojiljkovic I. Hantke K. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 4359-4367Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). The specific function of hemP is uncertain. The ydiE gene is associated with a well predicted Fur box and its homologue (hemP) in S. typhimurium is Fur repressed (28Tsolis R.M. Baumler A.J. Stojiljkovic I. Heffron F. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 4628-4637Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), supporting the Fe2+-Fur dependent regulation observed here. The final locus also comprises a single gene, yqjH, homologous (28% identity at the amino acid sequence level) with the siderophore-utilization gene (viuB) of Vibrio cholerae. yqjH has an appropriately positioned potential Fur box (29Panina E.M. Mironov A.A. Gelfand M.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 5195-5206Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) consistent with its Fe2+-Fur dependence. Energy Metabolism: Control of Iron-rich Proteins—Unexpectedly, a large number of genes encoding proteins involved in energy metabolism were found to be Fe2+-Fur-regulated (Table II). Of those genes and operons listed in Table II, only cyoA and gpmA have previously been reported to be Fe2+-Fur-controlled (8Vassinova N. Kozyruv D. Microbiol. 2000; 146: 3171-3182Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 6Stojiljkovic I. Bäumler A.J. Hantke K. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 236: 531-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). Most (36Park S-J Tseng C-P. Gunsalus R.P. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 15: 473-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar) were induced by the Fe2+-Fur complex of which 32 encode iron-containing respiratory complexes associated with a total of 148 iron atoms (per subunit). We speculate that this Fur-dependent control of iron-containing respiratory proteins represents a newly recognized iron homeostatic mechanism whereby the production of a subset of iron proteins is regulated according to iron availability. Such a mechanism would allow the cellular demand for iron to be reduced under iron-restricted growth conditions, enabling available iron to be utilized more economically and helping to ensure that production of Fe-requiring proteins does not exceed iron availability. Partly consistent with the data in Table II, previous work has shown that the anaerobic expression of cydA, cyoA, narG, and frdA is 2–14-fold reduced by dip (note that for cyoA and cydA this effect required an fnr background) (30Cotter P.A. Darie S. Gunsalus R.P. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1992; 100: 227-232Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, in contrast to the findings presented here, this effect appeared to be Fur-independent (the iron-dependent regulator was not identified; Ref. 30Cotter P.A. Darie S. Gunsalus R.P. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1992; 100: 227-232Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Nearly all of the Fe2+-Fur induced genes in Table II require the anaerobic regulator, Fnr, and anaerobiosis for full induction (31Spiro S. Guest J.R. FEMS Microbiol Rev. 1990; 75: 399-428Crossref Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Although the growth conditions used here were aerobic, O2 tensions are very low during late-log growth in rich broth (32Rainnie D.J. Bragg P.D. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1973; 77: 339-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) and thus could favor Fnr-dependent expression. It is also possible that anaerobic conditions were introduced at the sample harvesting stage. A potential complication is the possible inactivation of Fnr by the iron chelator and consequent down-regulation of the Fnr-dependent genes in Table II (30Cotter P.A. Darie S. Gunsalus R.P. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1992; 100: 227-232Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, such an effect would not be anticipated for the fur mutant and so would not explain both the dip and the fur expression effects shown in Table II. The Fe2+-Fur induced genes listed in Table II are not essential and the observed reductions in their expression during aerobic growth would not be expected to lead to a major growth defect. Indeed, although fnr mutants are unable to express anaerobic respiratory complexes, they retain the ability to grow both anaerobically (via fermentation) and aerobically. The induction of expression by the Fe2+-Fur complex is likely to be indirect since for most of the Fe2+-Fur induced genes (Tables I, II, and IV), there appear to be no associated Fur boxes. It is probable that the recently identified Fur-dependent regulatory RNA molecule, RyhB, acts as the direct regulator of these genes (11Massé E. Gottesman S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 4620-4625Crossref PubMed Scopus (854) Google Scholar). It is noteworthy that not all Fe-protein-encoding genes appear to be induced by Fe2+-Fur. This may reflect the high importance of some Fe-proteins, such as the aerobic ribonucleotide reductase (NrdAB) required for DNA biosysnthesis. It is also interesting to note that the expression of gpmA (encoding phosphoglycerate mutase in the glycolytic pathway) and gltA (encoding the TCA cycle enzyme, citrate synthase) is repressed by the Fe2+-Fur complex (Table II), whereas acnA (encoding the TCA cycle enzyme aconitase A that converts citrate into isocitrate) is known to be induced by Fe2+-Fur, suggesting that E. coli may respond to iron restriction by producing citrate to mediate iron uptake. Expression of the citrate synthase gene (prpC) is also Fur repressed in Shewanella oneidensis (44Thompson D.K. Beliaev A.S. Giometti C.S. Tollaksen S.L. Khare T. Lies D.P. Nealson K.H. Lim H. Yates III, J. Brandt C.C. Tiedje J.M. Zhou J. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2002; 68: 881-892Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Quantitative RT-PCR was used to confirm the Fe2+-Fur dependent expression of 12 iron-regulated genes (Table III). Although the directions of regulation were identical for the RT-PCR and array data, the degree of regulation varied considerably and was generally greater for the RT-PCR analysis, presumably reflecting the higher quantitative precision obtained with RT-PCR. Control experiments with polA (encoding DNA polymerase I) showed no significant Fe2+"

Thus, this drug can potentially reverse DNA methylation patterns and erase stable methylation imprints on DNA in non-dividing cells. Recent discoveries support a role for VPA in the regulation of methylated genes; however, the mechanism has been unclear because it is difficult to dissociate active demethylation from the absence of DNA methylation during DNA synthesis. We therefore took advantage of an assay that measures active DNA demethylation independently from other DNA methylation and DNA replication activities in human embryonal kidney 293 cells. We show that VPA induces histone acetylation, DNA demethylation, and expression of an ectopically methylated CMV-GFP plasmid in a dose-dependent manner. In contrast, valpromide, an analogue of VPA that does not induce histone acetylation, does not induce demethylation or expression of CMV-GFP. Furthermore, we illustrate that methylated DNA-binding protein 2/DNA demethylase (MBD2/dMTase) participates in this reaction since antisense knockdown of MBD2/dMTase attenuates VPA-induced demethylation. Taken together, our data support a new mechanism of action for VPA as enhancing intracellular demethylase activity through its effects on histone acetylation and raises the possibility that DNA methylation is reversible independent of DNA replication by commonly prescribed drugs.

DNA methylation is a modification of DNA whereby methyl groups are added as part of the covalent structure of the genome, thus providing an extra layer of epigenetic information. A well documented relationship exists between DNA methylation, chromatin structure, and gene expression (1Razin A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4905-4908Crossref PubMed Scopus (661) Google Scholar) such that methylated genes are generally transcriptionally silent. Two mechanisms have been proposed to explain this repression: the first is that methylation causes interference in the binding of transcription factors and has been shown for several proteins such as AP2 (2Comb M. Goodman H.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 3975-3982Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar) and c-Myc (3Prendergast G.C. Ziff E.B. Science. 1991; 251: 186-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar). The second mechanism involves the recruitment of various repressor complexes to methylated DNA via the binding of methylated DNA-binding proteins (MBDs). 1The abbreviations used are: MBD, methylated DNA-binding protein; MBD2/dMTase, MBD2/DNA demethylase; VPA, valproate/valproic acid; VPM, valpromide; HDAC, histone deacetylase; Ac-H3, acetyl histone H3; TSA, trichostatin A; 5-aza, 2′deoxycytidine-5-aza-CdR; GFP, green fluorescent protein; ChIP, chromatin immunoprecipitation. These complexes contain proteins that have histone deacetylase and chromatin remodeling activities, leading to the formation of a more compact and transcriptionally inactive chromatin (4Nan X. Ng H.H. Johnson C.A. Laherty C.D. Turner B.M. Eisenman R.N. Bird A. Nature. 1998; 393: 386-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (2788) Google Scholar). Valproic acid/Valproate/2-n-propylpentanoic acid (VPA) has been used for decades in the treatment of epilepsy and is also effective as a mood stabilizer and in migraine therapy. Recent data suggest that this drug, in addition to its other known classical actions, can modulate the epigenome by inhibiting histone deacetylases (HDACs) (5Phiel C.J. Zhang F. Huang E.Y.

EMBO J. 2001; 20: 6969-6978Crossref PubMed Scopus (1568) Google Scholar), similar to agents such as trichostatin A (TSA) and n-butyrate, thus triggering an increase in gene expression. Other studies also support a role for VPA in the regulation of methylated genes. It was demonstrated that the reelin gene, which encodes a neuronal protein that is down-regulated in schizophrenia, is methylated in neuronal precursor cells, accompanied by minimal expression. Following treatment of these cells by 5′-aza-2′-deoxycytidine (5-aza-CdR), a known DNA methylation inhibitor, or VPA, the expression of reelin is induced (7Chen Y. Sharma R.P. Costa R.H. Costa E. Grayson D.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 2930-2939Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). VPA can also revert the down-regulation of both reelin and gad67 caused by l-methionine, an agent shown to increase DNA methylation (8Tremolizzo L. Carboni G. Ruzicka W.B. Mitchell C.P. Sugaya I. Tueting P. Sharma R. Grayson D.R. Costa E. Guidotti A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 17095-17100Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). Similarly, both 5-aza-CdR and VPA induce the expression of 5-lipoxygenase (9Manev H. Uz T. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 2002; 445: 149-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The data presented above suggest the possibility that VPA may also be able to trigger DNA demethylation. The prospect of erasing established DNA methylation patterns in somatic non-dividing tissue is extremely attractive and might have important therapeutic applications. However, the generally accepted model is that the DNA methylation pattern is an irreversible reaction, maintained only by DNA methyltransferase activities. If this is the case, then demethylation could only come about when replication occurs in the absence of DNA methyltransferase. Therefore, it should be impossible to reverse DNA methylation in non-dividing postmitotic tissues such as the brain. VPA, according to this classical model, could only act by inhibiting DNA methylation during DNA synthesis. However, there are several pieces of evidence indicating that DNA demethylation can occur in the absence of cell division (10Wilks A. Seldran M. Jost J.P.

In addition, a DNA demethylase activity was purified in our laboratory from the human lung cancer cell line A549 (16Ramchandani S. Bhattacharya S.K. Cervoni N. Szyf M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 6107-6112Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar), and the methylated DNA-binding protein 2/DNA demethylase (MBD2/dMTase) was found to actively demethylate DNA both in vitro (17Bhattacharya S.K. Ramchandani S. Cervoni N. Szyf M. Nature. 1999; 397: 579-583Crossref PubMed Scopus (546) Google Scholar) and in living cells (18Cervoni N. Szyf M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 40778-40787Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar, 19Detich N. Theberge J. Szyf M. J. Biol.

Reinberg D. Bird A. Nat. Genet. 1999; 23: 58-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar, 21Hendrich B. Guy J. Ramsahoye B. Wilson V.A. Bird A. Genes. Dev. 2001; 15: 710-723Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar) have nevertheless disputed the demethylase activity of MBD2. Since we have shown that active demethylation can be induced or inhibited by modifying histone acetylation (18Cervoni N. Szyf M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 40778-40787Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar, 22Cervoni N. Detich N. Seo S. Chakravarti D. Szyf M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 25026-25031Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar), and in view of the fact that VPA is also known to be an HDAC inhibitor, we hypothesize that it might act by increasing histone acetylation and increasing the accessibility of demethylase to DNA. If VPA acts by this mechanism, it might be used to stably erase methylation of specific genes in tissues where DNA replication does not take place. It is impossible to determine whether hypomethylation of a gene in vivo or in living cells following a drug treatment is caused either by passive demethylation, resulting from inhibition of DNA methylation during DNA synthesis (as with 5-aza-CdR), or by an the active removal of the methyl group by an enzyme. We have recently described a model system (18Cervoni N. Szyf M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 40778-40787Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar) that allows one to distinguish between these two mechanisms. When an in vitro methylated CMV-GFP plasmid is transiently transfected into the human embryonal kidney cell line HEK 293, it generally remains methylated. Increasing histone acetylation induces active demethylation of the plasmid (18Cervoni N. Szyf M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 40778-40787Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). Since we have shown that the plasmid does not replicate during the time frame of the experiment, nor is it methylated by DNA methyltransferases, the demethylation measured by this assay is active demethylation and not passive demethylation. We have recently used this assay to demonstrate the inhibition of active demethylation by inhibitors of histone acetylation (22Cervoni N. Detich N. Seo S. Chakravarti D. Szyf M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 25026-25031Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). In this report, we utilize this assay to test the hypothesis that VPA treatment induces active DNA demethylation in living cells. Our data have important potential implications on the therapeutic reversal of pathological DNA methylation in non-dividing somatic tissues. In Vitro Methylation of Substrates—CMV-GFP (pEGFP-C1 from Clontech; GenBank™ accession number U55763) was methylated in vitro with SssI CpG methyltransferase (New England Biolabs), which methylates all cytosine residues within the double-stranded dinucleotide recognition sequence 5′.. .CG.. .3′. Ten μg of plasmid DNA was incubated with 12 units of SssI in the recommended buffer containing 800 μm S-adenosylmethionine for 3 h at 37 °C. Twelve units of SssI and 0.16 μmol of S-adenosylmethionine were then added, and the reaction was further incubated for an additional 3 h. The methylated plasmid was recovered by phenol/chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation, and complete methylation was confirmed by observing full protection from HpaII digestion. Cell Culture and Transient Transfections—Human embryonal kidney HEK 293 cells (ATCC number CRL 1573) were plated at a density of 7.5 × 104/well in a 6-well dish and transiently transfected with 80 ng of CMV-GFP (methylated or mock-methylated) using the calcium phosphate precipitation method as described previously (23Rouleau J. Tanigawa G. Szyf M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 7368-7377Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Twenty-four h after transfection, cells were treated with one of the following: 1–20 mm VPA (sodium salt, Sigma), 0.3 μm TSA (Sigma), or 5 mm valpromide (VPM)(kindly donated by Katwijk chemie bv), or left untreated. Fresh media containing VPA and VPM were replaced after an additional 24 h, and cells were harvested 72 h after transfection. To determine the effects of MBD2/dMTase knockdown on demethylation of CMV-GFP, 1.6 μg of either a pRetroTet On MBD2 antisense expression plasmid (24Slack A. Bovenzi V. Bigey P. Ivanov M.A. Ramchandani S. Bhattacharya S. tenOever B. Lamrihi B. Scherman D. Szyf M. J. Gene Med. 2002; 4: 381-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) or the pRetroTet On empty vector (Clontech) was added to the CMV-GFP transfection mixture followed by treatment with 20 mm VPA. Each experiment was performed in triplicate, and experiments were performed several times using different cultures of HEK 293 cells. 5-aza-CdR was purchased from (Sigma). Southern Blot Analysis—DNA was extracted from HEK 293 cells using the DNeasy tissue kit (Qiagen). DNA was first digested with 50 units of EcoRI followed by digestion with 20 units of either HpaII or MspI restriction enzymes. Samples were subjected to electrophoresis on a 1.5% agarose gel and then transferred to Hybond-N+ membrane (Amersham Biosciences). Blots were probed with a 32P-labeled CMV-GFP cDNA probe (AvaII-Cfr10I fragment) synthesized using a random priming labeling kit (Roche Applied Science). Membranes were hybridized at 68 °C for 4–6 h in a buffer containing 0.5 m sodium phosphate, pH 6.8, 1 mm EDTA, 7% SDS, and 0.2 mg/ml herring sperm DNA. Following hybridization, the membranes were washed twice for 10 min in a 5% SDS, 0.04 m sodium phosphate, pH 6.8, 1 mm EDTA solution and then four times for 10 min in the same solution containing 1% SDS. The demethylation assay measures the fraction of CMV-GFP molecules that were demethylated using HpaII restriction enzyme, which cleaves unmethylated CCGG but does not cleave methylated CCGG sequences. The methylated GFP DNA remains intact following HpaII digestion and is identical to the fragment obtained following EcoRI digestion (see Fig. 2C, Me), whereas the unmethylated GFP DNA is cleaved by HpaII, resulting in a 0.5-kb fragment (see Fig. 2C, U). We scanned each HpaII-digested lane and measured the intensity of the total signal hybridizing with the GFP probe in the same HpaII lane (including the unmethylated U and methylated Me fragments); this value is equal to 100% of CMV-GFP molecules in the lane. We then determined the intensity of the unmethylated signal per HpaII lane and divided this value (U) by the total signal for CMV-GFP (U + M) in the same HpaII lane. The percent demethylation is thus calculated as (U/(U + Me)) × 100. The results of three independent experiments were quantified and averaged. Bisulfite Mapping—Bisulfite mapping was performed exactly as described (22Cervoni N. Detich N. Seo S. Chakravarti D. Szyf M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 25026-25031Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar) Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP) Assays—CMV-GFP transfections and VPA treatments were performed essentially as described previously except that HEK 293 cells were seeded in 10-cm plates (2/sample) at a density of 5 × 105/plate, and 0.5 μg of methylated GFP was used. ChIP assays were performed by following the Upstate Biotechnology ChIP assay kit protocol (catalog number 17-295). Chromatin was immunoprecipitated using anti-acetylated histone H3 antibody (Upstate Biotechnology, catalog number 06-599) as recommended by the manufacturer. PCR reactions were repeated exhaustively using serial dilutions (1–1:10,000) of template to determine the linear range of the PCR, and a final dilution of 1100 was used. The following primers were used to amplify a 500-bp region of the GFP gene: 5′-CAAGGGCGAGGAGCTGTT-3′ (sense) and 5′-CGGCCATGATATAGACGTTG-3′ (antisense) at an annealing temperature of 58 °C. Western Blot Analysis—GFP Western blots were performed exactly as in Ref. 18Cervoni N. Szyf M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 40778-40787Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar. For MBD2 Western blots, nuclear extracts were prepared from HEK 293 cells as described (25Szyf M. Bozovic V. Tanigawa G. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 10027-10030Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Twenty-five to 50 μg of nuclear proteins was loaded onto a 10% SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membrane. Anti-MBD2 monoclonal antibody (IMG147, Imgenex, San Diego, CA) was used at a dilution of 1:200 in a solution of Tris-buffered saline (0.05 m Tris, 0.2 m NaCl, pH 7.6) + 0.5% Tween 20 + 5% milk overnight at 4 °C. The blot was then reacted with peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse secondary antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch) at a 1:20,000 dilution. The enhanced chemiluminescence detection kit (Amersham Biosciences) was used for all Western blots. Membranes were also stained with 0.1% Amido Black (in 25% isopropanol, 10% acetic acid) or probed with an antibody to β-actin to confirm equal loading of protein in each lane. β-actin Western blots were performed using a 1:5000 dilution of anti-β-actin monoclonal antibody (Sigma catalog number A-5316) followed by mouse secondary antibody as just described for MBD2. Both the Western blots and Amido-stained membranes were quantified using NIH Image 1.62 software, and the GFP/MBD2 signal was normalized to the total protein in each lane. The Association of CMV-GFP with Acetylated Histones Is Increased in the Presence of VPA—We first validated that VPA induces histone acetylation of transiently transfected ectopically methylated CMV-GFP in our system, using ChIP assays with anti-acetyl-histone H3 (anti-Ac-H3). The results presented in Fig. 1A show that, whereas a minimal fraction of the transfected methylated GFP gene is associated with Ac-H3 in control cells (lane 3), the fraction of transfected methylated CMV-GFP associated with Ac-H3 increased 7-fold (lane 6) following a 48-h treatment with 20 mm VPA (Fig. 1B). Thus, VPA is effective in inducing histone acetylation around the transiently transfected methylated CMV-GFP gene. VPA Stimulates Active Demethylation of Ectopically Methylated CMV-GFP in a Dose-dependent Manner—We next tested the hypothesis that VPA triggers active DNA demethylation of transiently transfected methylated CMV-GFP, similarly to TSA, an HDAC inhibitor (18Cervoni N. Szyf M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 40778-40787Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). To measure active demethylation, we must use a system in which the DNA of interest (i.e. CMV-GFP) does not undergo replication. The CMV-GFP plasmid does not bear an origin of replication and should not replicate in HEK 293 cells; this was validated in a previous study (18Cervoni N. Szyf M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 40778-40787Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). We have shown that methylated CMV-GFP does not replicate in HEK 293 cells using the restriction enzymes DpnI and XbaI (18Cervoni N. Szyf M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 40778-40787Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). DpnI cleaves the sequence GATC only when the adenine is methylated on both strands (26McWhinney C. Leffak M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 1233-1242Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Because mammalian cells do not bear a methylase that methylates the adenine in GATC, replication of the plasmid in HEK cells will render it resistant to DpnI digestion. XbaI, on the other hand, does not cleave the sequence TCTAGATC (which is present in CMV-GFP) when the adenine is methylated (27McClelland M. Nelson M. Raschke E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 3640-3659Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar). Replication of the plasmid in mammalian cells will render it sensitive to XbaI digestion. Our data demonstrated that CMV-GFP is completely digested with DpnI and resistant to XbaI digestion (18Cervoni N. Szyf M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 40778-40787Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar), indicating that CMV-GFP does not replicate in HEK 293 cells, and therefore, any demethylation observed is occurring actively. In this study, we first determined the effects of increasing doses of VPA on the demethylation of methylated CMV-GFP (Fig. 2). DNA was isolated from HEK 293 cells transfected with methylated CMV-GFP DNA (whose full methylation status was confirmed prior to transfection (Fig. 2A)) for 72 h and treated with 0–20 mm VPA. Cells were also treated with 0.3 μm TSA as a positive control since we have shown that this leads to nearly 100% demethylation (18Cervoni N. Szyf M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 40778-40787Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). DNA was first linearized with the EcoRI restriction enzyme followed by digestion with MspI (which cleaves the sequence CCGG) or HpaII (which cleaves the sequence CCGG only when it is not methylated). The demethylated, HpaII-digested 529-bp fragment (U), and the methylated undigested DNA (Me) were quantified within each sample (to control for possible loading differences), and the percent methylation for total CMV-GFP DNA in each lane was determined as (Me/(U + Me)) × 100. As can be seen in Fig. 2, C and E, there is a minimal amount of CMV-GFP demethylation in untreated HEK 293 cells, most likely due to the background histone acetylation of the transfected plasmid, which allows access to demethylase even in the absence of histone deacetylase inhibitors as has been shown previously (18Cervoni N. Szyf M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 40778-40787Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). The addition of VPA results in a dose-dependent active demethylation of methylated CMV-GFP, which is illustrated by the increase in the ratio of the 529 bp HpaII fragment (U) to the undigested DNA (Me). The addition of 20 mm VPA results in almost complete demethylation, similar to 0.3 μm TSA. Fig. 2B confirms that unmethylated CMV-GFP, transfected under identical conditions, does not get de novo methylated in our system, either in the presence or in the absence of 20 mm VPA, suggesting that VPA does act on DNA methyltransferase activity. To determine whether this demethylation is dependent on HDAC inhibitory properties of VPA, we used our assay to compare the effects of VPA with those of its analogue VPM, which is not an HDAC inhibitor (5Phiel C.J. Zhang F. Huang E.Y. Guenther M.G. Lazar M.A. Klein P.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 36734-36741Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1475) Google Scholar). Fig. 2, D and F, illustrates that, although 5 mm VPA results in almost 50% demethylation, the same concentration of VPM has virtually no effect. Together, the above data support the hypothesis that VPA, through its ability to induce histone hyperacetylation, is an inducer of active DNA demethylation. We also confirmed our results by an independent bisulfite analysis, which determines the methylation pattern at single base resolution (28Clark S.J. Harrison J. Paul C.L. Frommer M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 2990-2997Crossref PubMed Scopus (1622) Google Scholar). The results of these analyses, presented in Fig. 2G, reveal that methylated CMV-GFP retains its methylation pattern in untreated HEK 293 cells (filled circles represent methylated CpGs). In contrast, a 20 mm VPA treatment results in almost complete demethylation of all the methylated CpG sites tested in CMV-GFP (open circles), with the exception of three different CpG sites in several clones. It is not clear why these CpGs are not demethylated. One explanation is that the binding of a specific protein to a methylated CpG site protects it from demethylation. However, if this were the case, one would expect the consistent methylation of the same CpG in the majority of clones. Since the methylated sites we observe occur more or less randomly in different clones, a more likely explanation is simply slight inaccuracy on the part of the demethylase enzyme. The Expression of Methylated CMV-GFP Is Induced by VPA and Is Dose-dependent—Several studies have demonstrated that VPA treatment can lead to activation of unmethylated genes by inducing histone acetylation (5Phiel C.J.

Chem. 2001; 276: 36734-36741Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1475) Google Scholar), activating the Wnt signaling pathway (5Phiel C.J. Zhang F. Huang E.Y. Guenther M.G.

Neurochem. 1999; 72: 1327-1330Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar), or activating AP-1-dependent transcription (30Asghari V. Wang J.F. Reiach J.S. Young L.T. Brain Res. Mol. Brain Res. 1998; 58: 95-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Certain methylated genes are also induced by VPA treatment, but it was not determined whether demethylation is involved. We therefore determined whether demethylation of CMV-GFP by VPA changes its state of expression using a Western blot analysis with anti-GFP antibody. As shown in Fig. 3, A and B, transiently transfected methylated CMV-GFP is almost fully repressed in untreated HEK 293 cells (lane 1) as expected. The small amount of GFP protein observed corresponds to the minimal demethylation occurring in untreated cells (Fig. 2C). Following treatment with 1–20 mm VPA, a dose-dependent induction of CMV-GFP expression is observed. Thus, the doses of VPA that lead to the increased demethylation of CMV-GFP also induce gene expression. VPM, which does not induce histone acetylation, has no effect on GFP protein levels (Fig. 3, C and D), indicating that the ability of VPA to promote both the demethylation (Fig. 2) and expression of CMV-GFP is dependent upon its HDAC inhibitory activity. The induction of expression by VPA might be a consequence of demethylation, or alternatively, demethylation and expression are independent effects of the HDAC inhibitory activity of VPA. To address this issue, we compared the induction of methylated CMV-GFP and unmethylated CMV-GFP following identical transfections and 10 mm VPA treatment. If demethylation were not required for the effects of VPA on expression, then one would predict a similar fold activation of methylated and unmethylated CMV-GFP. The induction of unmethylated CMV-GFP by VPA is shown in Fig. 3, E and F, and the comparison with the methylated plasmid is presented in Fig. 3G. This experiment demonstrates that VPA induces the expression of methylated CMV-GFP (12-fold) to a greater extent than the unmethylated counterpart (3-fold). Taken together, our data are consistent with the hypothesis that VPA induces the expression of methylated genes through its effects on both histone acetylation and DNA demethylation, the latter of which is unique to methylated genes. MBD2/dMTase Is a Demethylase Enzyme Involved in the Active Demethylation Induced by VPA—We have previously hypothesized that the open chromatin structure brought about by histone acetylation favors access of demethylase enzymes to the DNA (18Cervoni N. Szyf M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 40778-40787Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar, 22Cervoni N. Detich N. Seo S. Chakravarti D. Szyf M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 25026-25031Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). We determined whether MBD2/dMTase, the only demethylase characterized to date, is involved in the demethylation induced by VPA by measuring the effect of antisense knockdown of MBD2/dMTase. HEK 293 cells were transfected with methylated CMV-GFP, together with an MBD2 antisense expression construct (AS-MBD2) (24Slack A. Bovenzi V. Bigey P. Ivanov M.A. Ramchandani S. Bhattacharya S. tenOever B. Lamrihi B. Scherman D. Szyf M. J. Gene Med. 2002; 4: 381-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) or an empty vector as a control. Following treatment with 20 mm VPA, cells were harvested and subjected to Southern blot analysis as in Fig. 2. The results shown in Fig. 4A and quantified (average of three experiments) in Fig. 4B indicate that antisense knockdown of MBD2/dMTase inhibits demethylation induced by VPA by ∼70%. A Western blot analysis using an anti-MBD2 antibody confirmed that MBD2/dMTase levels were knocked down by 50% by the antisense treatment (Fig. 4, C and D). These data indicate that MBD2/dMTase mediates, at least in part, the active demethylation triggered by VPA. The residual (30%) demethylation remaining after antisense knockdown of MBD2/dMTase could be due to either incomplete knockdown (as demonstrated in the Western blot analysis) or the presence of other as of yet uncharacterized demethylases. VPA is a well tolerated drug that has been used for many years in the treatment of epilepsy and bipolar disorder. Although several modes of action have been proposed to explain the therapeutic effects of VPA, this report describes a novel mechanism that could potentially be involved. Our studies imply that VPA activates methylated genes by stimulating active, replication-independent demethylation. It has been shown before that VPA can induce hypomethylation in the rat liver (31Alonso-Aperte E. Ubeda N. Achon M. Perez-Miguelsanz J. Varela-Moreiras G. Neurology. 1999; 52: 750-756Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), similar to the DNA methylation inhibitor 5-aza-CdR, but it was not clear whether it does so by inhibiting DNA methylation or by other mechanisms. This report tested the hypothesis that DNA methylation is a reversible process, and therefore, that drugs that affect DNA methylation patterns might do so either by inhibiting DNA methylation or by promoting demethylation. We took advantage of an assay developed previously in our laboratory (18Cervoni N. Szyf M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 40778-40787Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar), which measures active demethylation in living cells, to test whether VPA can stimulate active demethylation. Using a ChIP assay, we first demonstrate that VPA induces acetylation of H3 histones associated with methylated CMV-GFP (Fig. 1), which is in accordance with previous studies demonstrating the HDAC inhibitory activity of VPA (5Phiel C.J. Zhang F. Huang E.Y. Guenther M.G. Lazar M.A. Klein P.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 36734-36741Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1475) Google Scholar, 6Gottlicher M. Minucci S. Zhu P. Kramer O.H. Schimpf A. Giavara S. Sleeman J.P. Lo Coco F. Nervi C. Pelicci P.G. Heinzel T. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 6969-6978Crossref PubMed Scopus (1568) Google Scholar). Second, we show that VPA stimulates active demethylation of ectopically methylated and transiently transfected CMV-GFP DNA (Fig. 2, C and E). Third, we illustrate that demethylation is dependent on histone acetylation since the analogue VPM, which is not an HDAC inhibitor, has no effect (Fig. 2, D and F). Bisulfite mapping analysis confirms these data and indicates that VPA stimulates the erasure of the entire methylation pattern of CMV-GFP (Fig. 2G). We propose that VPA stimulates demethylation by inducing acetylation of H3 histones associated with CMV-GFP and increasing the accessibility of demethylase to the DNA. Previous studies have demonstrated that 3 mm VPA are required to induce significant histone acetylation (5Phiel C.J. Zhang F. Huang E.Y. Guenther M.G. Lazar M.A. Klein P.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 36734-36741Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1475) Google Scholar, 6Gottlicher M. Minucci S. Zhu P. Kramer O.H. Schimpf A. Giavara S. Sleeman J.P. Lo Coco F. Nervi C. Pelicci P.G. Heinzel T. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 6969-6978Crossref PubMed Scopus (1568) Google Scholar), and similarly, we observe 50% demethylation at 5 mm. Although this value is slightly higher than the serum concentrations (1 mm) achieved in patients treated with VPA (32Loscher W. CNS Drugs. 2002; 16: 669-694Crossref PubMed Scopus (548) Google Scholar), we do begin to see a small increase in demethylation at 1 mm. The difference with our study is that is that the cells are only exposed to VPA for 48 h; it is therefore possible that a longer treatment with lower VPA concentrations would produce similar effects. In support of this, it has been shown that both the methylated genes for reelin and gad67 are up-regulated in rats treated with tolerated doses of VPA (300 mg/kg) for 15 days (8Tremolizzo L. Carboni G. Ruzicka W.B. Mitchell C.P. Sugaya I. Tueting P. Sharma R. Grayson D.R. Costa E. Guidotti A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 17095-17100Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). The demethylation we observe further increases up to 20 mm VPA. It is unclear whether at higher concentrations, VPA acts exclusively as a histone deacetylase inhibitor or whether it may trigger another as of yet unknown process leading to enhanced demethylation. Fourth, we show that VPA induces the expression of methylated CMV-GFP (Fig. 3, A and B), illustrating that VPA concurrently affects both active demethylation of DNA and gene expression. Furthermore, we demonstrate that demethylation directly contributes to the effects on gene expression (Fig. 3G). These data are consistent with a previous report illustrating that the methylated 5-lipoxygenase gene can be activated by VPA in non-proliferating cells, whereas 5-aza-CdR is only effective in cells that divide (9Manev H. Uz T. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 2002; 445: 149-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). However, this study did not determine whether VPA induced demethylation. Finally, we show that MBD2/dMTase is required for VPA-induced demethylation, supporting the hypothesis that demethylase activity is required for the demethylation triggered by VPA. MBD2/dMTase has been shown to act as an active demethylase enzyme in vitro (16Ramchandani S. Bhattacharya S.K. Cervoni N. Szyf M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 6107-6112Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar), it is able to stimulate methylated genes in transfection experiments (18Cervoni N. Szyf M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 40778-40787Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar, 19Detich N. Theberge J. Szyf M. J. Biol.

Chem. 2003; 278: 15333-15340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar), and its expression is associated with demethylation of endogenous genes (34Hattori M. Sakamoto H. Satoh K. Yamamoto T. Cancer Lett. 2001; 169: 155-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). In contrast, some groups reported previously that they failed to observe demethylase activity in vitro for MBD2 (20Ng H.H. Zhang Y. Hendrich B. Johnson C.A. Turner B.M. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Reinberg D. Bird A. Nat. Genet. 1999; 23: 58-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar), although the reason behind this discrepancy is unclear. Mbd2–/– knockouts also did not exhibit global differences in DNA methylation (21Hendrich B. Guy J. Ramsahoye B. Wilson V.A. Bird A. Genes. Dev. 2001; 15: 710-723Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar); however, this study did not examine the demethylation of specific genes. Therefore it is possible that MBD2/dMTase is involved in specific demethylation events, which would be consistent with our data. Thus, VPA is the first therapeutic agent shown to be able to erase DNA methylation patterns in a replication-independent manner by stimulating the accessibility of a demethylase enzyme. An important point to note is that although our assay measures demethylation that is independent of replication, the HEK 293 cells we use are actively dividing. Thus, we do not know for certain whether postmitotic tissues possess the same machinery involved in chromatin organization and demethylation. However, we do know that MBD2/dMTase is expressed in postmitotic tissues such as the brain (35Jung B.P. Zhang G. Ho W. Francis J. Eubanks J.H. Neuroscience. 2002; 115: 515-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 36Francis J. Jung B. Zhang G. Cheng J. Ho W. Burnham W.M. Eubanks J.H. Neuroscience. 2002; 113: 79-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar) and liver (37Saito Y. Kanai Y. Sakamoto M. Saito H. Ishii H. Hirohashi S. Hepatology. 2001; 33: 561-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). Furthermore, previous studies have demonstrated that VPA can induce both histone acetylation and the expression of methylated genes (reelin, gad67, 5-lipoxygenase) in non-dividing tissues or cells at therapeutically relevant concentrations (8Tremolizzo L. Carboni G. Ruzicka W.B. Mitchell C.P. Sugaya I. Tueting P. Sharma R. Grayson D.R. Costa E. Guidotti A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 17095-17100Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar, 9Manev H. Uz T. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 2002; 445: 149-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Although further studies are required to determine whether these genes become demethylated, the abovementioned findings together with our data support the possibility that VPA might be used to modify DNA methylation patterns in postmitotic tissues such as the brain. This observation has important therapeutic and biological implications since a number of genes such as FMR1 (38El-Osta A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 295: 575-581Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), NF 2 (39Kino T. Takeshima H. Nakao M. Nishi T. Yamamoto K. Kimura T. Saito Y. Kochi M. Kuratsu J. Saya H. Ushio Y. Genes Cells. 2001; 6: 441-454Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), and reelin (8Tremolizzo L. Carboni G. Ruzicka W.B. Mitchell C.P. Sugaya I. Tueting P. Sharma R. Grayson D.R. Costa E. Guidotti A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 17095-17100Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar) were shown to be silenced in the brain by mechanisms that might involve DNA methylation. The only available demethylating drug is 5-aza-CdR, which needs to be incorporated into DNA and inhibit DNA methyltransferase during cell division. Such a mechanism makes this drug, as well as other DNA methyltransferase inhibitors, ineffective in the brain. Several other HDAC inhibitors such as phenylbutyrate, depsipeptide, and suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid are known; however, they are currently only in use in clinical trials (40Johnstone R.W. Nat. Rev. Drug Discov. 2002; 1: 287-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (1349) Google Scholar). Interestingly, suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid is able to cross the blood-brain barrier and improves motor deficits in a mouse model of Huntington's disease (41Hockly E. Richon V.M. Woodman B. Smith D.L. Zhou X. Rosa E. Sathasivam K. Ghazi-Noori S. Mahal A. Lowden P.A. Steffan J.S. Marsh J.L. Thompson L.M. Lewis C.M. Marks P.A. Bates G.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 2041-2046Crossref PubMed Scopus (748) Google Scholar). However, VPA has the advantage in that it is already an established drug whose long term effects are known. If it is possible to take advantage of well tolerated HDAC inhibitors, such as VPA, to stimulate the erasure of DNA methylation by resident demethylases, then it might be feasible to therapeutically activate genes silenced by DNA methylation in the brain and other non-dividing tissues."
https://openalex.org/W2081478041,"Cyclin D1 is a proto-oncogene that functions by inactivation of the retinoblastoma tumor suppressor protein, RB. A common polymorphism in the cyclin D1 gene is associated with the production of an alternate transcript of cyclin D1, termed cyclin D1b. Both the polymorphism and the variant transcript are associated with increased risk for multiple cancers and the severity of a given cancer; however, the underlying activities of cyclin D1b have not been elucidated relative to the canonical cyclin D1a. Because cyclin D1b does not possess the threonine 286 phosphorylation site required for nuclear export and regulated degradation, it has been hypothesized to encode a stable nuclear protein that would constitutively inactivate the RB pathway. Surprisingly, we find that cyclin D1b protein does not inappropriately accumulate in cells and exhibits stability comparable to cyclin D1a. As expected, the cyclin D1b protein was constitutively localized in the nucleus, whereas cyclin D1a was exported to the cytoplasm in S-phase. Despite enhanced nuclear localization, we find that cyclin D1b is a poor catalyst of RB phosphorylation/inactivation. However, cyclin D1b potently induced cellular transformation in contrast to cyclin D1a. In summary, we demonstrate that cyclin D1b specifically disrupts contact inhibition in a manner distinct from cyclin D1a. These data reveal novel roles for d-type cyclins in tumorigenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2042070545,"To examine the oligomeric state and trafficking of the dopamine transporter (DAT) in different compartments of living cells, human DAT was fused to yellow (YFP) or cyan fluorescent protein (CFP). YFP-DAT and CFP-DAT were transiently and stably expressed in porcine aortic endothelial (PAE) cells, human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells, and an immortalized dopaminergic cell line 1RB3AN27. Fluorescence microscopic imaging of cells co-expressing YFP-DAT and CFP-DAT revealed fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) between CFP and YFP, which is consistent with an intermolecular interaction of DAT fusion proteins. FRET signals were detected between CFP- and YFP-DAT located at the plasma membrane and in intracellular membrane compartments. Phorbol esters or amphetamine induced the endocytosis of YFP/CFP-DAT to early and recycling endosomes, identified by Rab5, Rab11, Hrs and EEA.1 proteins. Interestingly, however, DAT was mainly excluded from Rab5- and Hrs-containing microdomains within the endosomes. The strongest FRET signals were measured in endosomes, indicative of efficient oligomerization of internalized DAT. The intermolecular DAT interactions were confirmed by co-immunoprecipitation. A DAT mutant that was retained in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) after biosynthesis was used to show that DAT is oligomeric in the ER. Moreover, co-expression of an ER-retained DAT mutant and wild-type DAT resulted in the retention of wild-type DAT in the ER. These data suggest that DAT oligomers are formed in the ER and then are constitutively maintained both at the cell surface and during trafficking between the plasma membrane and endosomes.

Plasma membrane transporters belonging to the family of Na+/Cl–-dependent neurotransmitter transporters play an important role in terminating the activity of the monoamine neurotransmitters and of γ-aminobutyric acid (see Ref. 1Zahniser N.R.

Jaber M. Jones S.R. Wightman R.M. Caron M.G. Nature. 1996; 379: 606-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (2040) Google Scholar). Because the efficiency of DA removal depends on the number of DAT molecules expressed at the plasma membrane, trafficking processes that control transporter distribution in the cell represent a potentially important mechanism by which neurotransmission could be regulated. Newly synthesized DAT acquires glycosylation in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and Golgi complex and is then trafficked to the plasma membrane. Typically, a large pool of mature DAT molecules are found at the cell surface of dopaminergic neurons and when DAT is heterologously expressed in tissue culture cells. However, DAT localization can be altered rapidly. Acute exposure of cells to either phorbol esters or substrates reduces the number of plasma membrane DATs and thus DAT function, and this reduction is due to acceleration of DAT endocytosis through a dynamin-dependent mechanism (3Daniels G.M.

Recently, it has been shown that DAT can interact with the anchoring protein PICK 1 and the adaptor protein Hic-5 (7Torres G.E. Yao W.D. Mohn A.R. Quan H. Kim K.M. Levey A.I. Staudinger J. Caron M.G.

Neurosci. 2002; 22: 7045-7054Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, in general, the molecular mechanisms controlling DAT trafficking are not yet well understood. The DAT molecule is predicted to have 12 membrane-spanning sequences with both amino and carboxyl termini oriented intracellularly. The specific function of DAT transmembrane (TM) motifs and termini are not well established. TM domains may play a role in intra- and intermolecular interactions. Many membrane receptors and other integral membrane proteins require dimerization or higher oligomerization for their activity. Several lines of evidence have suggested that monoamine transporters are also dimers or oligomers. Results with dominant negative forms of the serotonin transporter (SERT) and norepinephrine transporter were consistent with this idea (9Chang A.S. Starnes D.M. Chang S.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 249: 416-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 10Kitayama S. Ikeda T. Mitsuhata C. Sato T. Morita K. Dohi T. J. Biol.

Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 3106-3111Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). The results of fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) studies further confirmed that SERT and a γ-aminobutyric acid transporter (GAT-1) are homo-oligomers (12Schmid J.A. Scholze P. Kudlacek O.

Chem. 2002; 277: 43682-43690Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Early radiation inactivation studies also suggested that DAT exists as a dimer or oligomer (14Berger S.P. Farrell K. Conant D. Kempner E.S. Paul S.M. Mol. Pharmacol. 1994; 46: 726-731PubMed Google Scholar, 15Milner H.E. Beliveau R. Jarvis S.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1190: 185-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Recently, the potential for DAT to exist as dimer or higher-order oligomer in the plasma membrane has been demonstrated using chemical cross-linking (16Hastrup H. Karlin A. Javitch J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 10055-10060Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). More recently, Torres and co-workers (17Torres G.E. Carneiro A. Seamans K. Fiorentini C. Sweeney A. Yao W.D. Caron M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 2731-2739Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar) reported detection of DAT oligomerization by co-immunoprecipitation. In general, the mechanisms and functional roles of oligomerization of monoamine transporters remain to be defined. However, it has been proposed that SERT oligomerization may be important for its transport activity (9Chang A.S. Starnes D.M. Chang S.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 249: 416-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Oligomerization may be also required for proper trafficking of the newly synthesized transporter to the plasma membrane (13Scholze P. Freissmuth M. Sitte H.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 43682-43690Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 17Torres G.E. Carneiro A. Seamans K. Fiorentini C. Sweeney A. Yao W.D. Caron M.G. J. Biol.

Hence, we generated fluorescent human DAT fusion proteins, which allow visualization of DAT interactions during trafficking in living cells, and then used these proteins in conjunction with high resolution FRET microscopy to examine DAT oligomerization in various cellular compartments. The effective energy transfer between cyan (CFP) and yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) occurs when two proteins are 1–5 nm apart. This close proximity typically requires direct interaction of proteins tagged with YFP and CFP. Measurements of sensitized FRET signals (fluorescence of the acceptor due to energy transfer from excited donor) on a pixel-by-pixel basis are designed to visualize protein-protein interactions in individual compartments of single living cells. Using this approach, we found that DAT is oligomerized in all cellular compartments in which it is localized, including post-synthetic compartments, plasma membrane, and endosomes, where DAT is accumulated when endocytosis is stimulated by phorbol esters or the DAT substrate amphetamine.

Neurosci. 1997; 17: 960-974Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) with YFP (YFP-DAT) or CFP (CFP-DAT), a DNA fragment encoding the full-length DAT was obtained by PCR using Pfu polymerase (Stratagene Cloning Systems, La Jolla, CA), with a KpnI restriction site introduced into the 5′-end and a SmaI site into the 3′-end, and cloned into the pEYFP-C1 vector or pECFP-C1 vector (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA), respectively. To generate YFP-DAT′C615, a stop codon was created at the position corresponding to amino acid residue 616 in the full-length DAT/pEYFP-C1 using a QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit according to the manufacture's protocol (Stratagene). To generate YFP-ΔN-DAT lacking amino-terminal cytoplasmic portion, a DNA fragment encoding the DAT sequence corresponding to amino acid residues 66–620 was obtained by PCR using Pfu polymerase with a KpnI restriction site introduced into the 5′-end and a SmaI site into the 3′-end, and cloned into the pEYFP-C1 vector. Human Rab5a and Rab11a cDNAs were obtained from Guthrie cDNA Resource Center (Guthrie Research Institute, Sayre, PA). To generate YFP fusion proteins, full-length Rab5a and Rab11a were amplified by PCR and ligated into pEYFP-C1 by using the BglII and XhoI restriction sites. All constructs were verified by dideoxynucleotide sequencing. The construct EGFR-CFP was previously described (19Sorkin A. McClure M. Huang F. Carter R. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 1395-1398Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). YFP-Hrs (hepatocyte-growth factor receptor substrate) was provided by Dr. H. Stenmark (Radium Institute, Oslo, Norway). Cell Culture and Transfections—Porcine aortic endothelial (PAE) cells were grown in F12 medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum, antibiotics, and glutamine. HEK293T cells (further referred to as HEK293) were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum, antibiotics, and glutamine. Cells were grown to 50–80% confluency and transfected with appropriate plasmids using Effectine (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). In transient transfection experiments, the cells were split 1 day after transfection onto glass coverslips and used for experiments on the second or third day at about 50% confluency. For biochemical immunoprecipitation and biotinylation experiments the cells were plated into 100- or 35-mm dishes, respectively, and used for experiments on the second day at about 90% confluency. Entactin-Collagen IV-Laminin coating (Upstate Biotechnology, Lake Placid, NY) was applied to 35-mm dishes to increase HEK293 cell adherence. The immortalized dopaminergic cell line 1RB3AN27 was kindly provided by Dr. K. Prasad (University of Colorado Health Sciences Center) (20Clarkson E.D. Rosa F.G. Edwards-Prasad J. Weiland D.A. Witta S.E. Freed C.R. Prasad K.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 1265-1270Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). These cells were grown in RPMI medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and antibiotics. For selection of stable clones, PAE cells transfected with CFP-DAT, YFP-DAT, DAT, or YFP-ΔN-DAT were grown with G418 (400 μg/ml) to obtain a pool of constitutively expressing cells. The single cell clone selection was then carried out by the limited dilution method in 96-well dishes. PAE cells stably expressing DAT were transfected with a mixture of YFP-ΔN-DAT and pSUMS-Hygro constructs (10:1) and grown with G418 and hygromycin (0.2 μg/ml) to obtain clones stably expressing both DAT and YFP-ΔN-DAT. Uptake Assays—PAE cells expressing hDAT, CFP-DAT, or YFP-DAT were grown in 12-well plates for 2–3 days. The cells were rinsed and then assayed in Krebs-Ringer HEPES buffer (KRH; 120 mm NaCl, 4.7 mm KCl, 2.2. mm CaCl2, 1.2 mm Mg SO4, 1.2 mm KH2PO4, 10 mm glucose, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4) supplemented with 10 μm pargyline, 10 μm ascorbic acid, and 10 μm catechol. Assays (1 ml) included 50 nm [3H]DA plus increasing amounts of unlabeled DA (final concentrations 50 nm to 50 μm). Nonspecific [3H]DA accumulation was determined in the presence of 1 mm cocaine and averaged 2.0 ± 0.2% of total. After 10 min of incubation at 37 °C, uptake was terminated by quickly washing the cells three times with 1 ml of ice-cold KRH. Cells were then solubilized in 0.5 ml of 3% trichloroacetic acid for 30 min with gently shaking. Accumulated [3H]DA was determined by liquid scintillation counting. Data were analyzed using GraphPad Prism (San Diego, CA). Immunoprecipitation—PAE cells stably expressing DAT and/or YFP-ΔN-DAT grown on 100-mm dishes to about 90% confluency were washed three times with Ca2+,Mg2+-free phosphate-buffered saline (CMF-PBS). The cells were then solubilized by scraping with a rubber policeman in lysis buffer (50 mm NaCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.2, 10% glycerol, 10 mm dithiothreitol (DTT), 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm sodium fluoride, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 544 μm iodoacetamide, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 1% Triton X-100, 1% sodium deoxycholate) and by further incubating for 10 min at 4 °C. The lysates were then cleared by centrifugation for 10 min at 16,000 × g and incubated with polyclonal antibodies to GFP (18 μg per dish) overnight at 4 °C. Under these conditions, at least 95% of YFP-ΔN-DAT was immunoprecipitated. The precipitates were washed twice with lysis buffer supplemented with 100 mm NaCl, washed once without NaCl, and then denatured by heating in sample buffer for 5 min at 95 °C. The immunoprecipitates and the aliquots of cell lysates were resolved on 7.5% SDS-PAGE, and the proteins were transferred to the membrane. Western blotting was performed with monoclonal antibodies to GFP or DAT followed by species-specific secondary antibodies conjugated with horseradish peroxidase. The enhanced chemiluminescence kit was purchased from Pierce (Rockford, IL). Surface Biotinylation—PAE or HEK293T cells were grown in 35-mm dishes and used at 100% confluency. Cells were washed twice with cold phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.1 mm CaCl2 and 1 mm MgCl2 (PBS) and incubated for 20 min on ice with 1 mg/ml sulfosuccinimidyl-2-(biotinamido)ethyl-1,3-dithiopropionate (EZ-Link™ sulfo-NHS-S-S-biotin, Pierce) in PBS, followed by a second incubation with fresh NHS-S-S-biotin. After biotinylation, the cells were washed twice with cold PBS, incubated 20 min on ice with 0.1 m glycine in PBS, washed with PBS again, and solubilized in lysis buffer (see above) supplemented with 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 6.8) in which DTT was omitted. Cell lysates were precleared by centrifugation at 16,000 × g; the biotinylated proteins were precipitated with NeutrAvidin™ beads (Pierce), washed five times with lysis buffer, incubated in sample buffer supplemented with 100 mm DTT for 10 min to cleave disulfide bonds, and denatured by heating the beads in sample buffer at 95 °C for 5 min. Supernatants from the NeutrAvidin precipitation and the aliquots of cell lysates were further subjected to immunoprecipitation with rat anti-DAT or polyclonal anti-GFP. NeutrAvidin beads and immunoprecipitates were analyzed by electrophoresis and Western blotting. Immunofluorescence Staining—PAE cells expressing CFP-DAT were grown on glass coverslips and treated with Me2SO, PMA, or amphetamine at 37 °C. The cells were then washed with CMF-PBS and fixed with freshly prepared 4% paraformaldehyde (Electron Microscopy Sciences, Ft. Washington, PA) for 15 min at room temperature and mildly permeabilized using a 3-min incubation in CMF-PBS containing 0.1% Triton X-100 and 0.5% bovine serum albumin at room temperature. Cells were then incubated in CMF-PBS containing 0.5% bovine serum albumin at room temperature for 1 h with a monoclonal antibody to EEA.1 and then incubated for 30 min with a secondary donkey anti-mouse IgG labeled with Cy3 (Jackson Laboratories, West-Glove, PA). Both primary and secondary antibody solutions were precleared by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 10 min. After staining, the coverslips were mounted in Fluoromount-G (Southern Biotech Inc., Birmingham, AL) containing 1 mg/ml para-phenylenediamine. To obtain high resolution three-dimensional images of cells, the fluorescence imaging workstation consisted of a Nikon inverted microscope equipped with a 100× oil immersion objective lens, cooled charge-coupled device Sensi-Cam QE 16 MHz (Cooke, Germany), z-step motor, dual filter wheels, and a xenon 175-watt light source, all controlled by SlideBook 3.0 software (Intelligent Imaging Innovation, Denver, CO). Typically, 25–40 serial two-dimensional images were recorded at 100- to 200-nm intervals. A Z-stack of images obtained was deconvoluted using a modification of the constrained iteration method. Final arrangement of all images was performed using Adobe Photoshop. Live Cell Microscopy and FRET Imaging—PAE or HEK293 cells transiently or stably co-expressing various YFP/CFP-tagged proteins were grown on glass coverslips. The coverslips were mounted in a microscope chamber and placed on a microscope stage. To visualize CFP and YFP, consecutive images were acquired through corresponding filter channels. The method of sensitized FRET measurement has been described previously (19Sorkin A. McClure M. Huang F. Carter R. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 1395-1398Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar, 21Jiang X. Sorkin A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 1522-1535Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). We previously validated this technique by measuring FRET intensities in various control interaction pairs and by using the donor fluorescence recovery method (21Jiang X. Sorkin A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 1522-1535Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Briefly, images were acquired sequentially through YFP, CFP, and FRET filter channels. Filter sets used were: YFP (excitation, 500/20 nm; emission, 535/30 nm), CFP (excitation, 436/10 nm; emission, 470/30 nm), and FRET (excitation, 436/10 nm; emission, 535/30 nm). An 86004BS dichroic mirror (Chroma, Inc.) was utilized. Binning 2 × 2 modes and 100- to 250-ms integration times were used. The background images were subtracted from the raw images prior to carrying out FRET calculations. Corrected FRET (FRETC) was calculated on a pixel-by-pixel basis for the entire image using Equation 1: FRETC = FRET – (0.50 × CFP) – (0.02 × YFP), where FRET, CFP, and YFP correspond to background-subtracted images of cells co-expressing CFP and YFP acquired through the FRET, CFP, and YFP channels, respectively. 0.50 and 0.02 are the fractions of bleed-through of CFP and YFP fluorescence, respectively, through the FRET filter channel. The negative FRETC values obtained in some control experiments are due to slight overestimation of the bleed-through coefficients. FRETC values were calculated from the mean fluorescence intensities for each selected sub-region of the image containing individual ruffles, phylopodia and lamellipodia (plasma membrane), diffuse fluorescence of the plasma membrane, endosomes, and tubular-vesicular ER structures according to Equation 1. Normalized sensitized FRET (FRETN) values for individual cellular compartments were calculated according to Equation 2: FRETN = FRETC/YFP × CFP, where FRETC, CFP, and YFP are the mean intensities of FRETC, CFP, and YFP fluorescence in the selected sub-region. In these calculations, the fluorescence intensity of CFP was underestimated because of donor fluorescence quenching due to FRET. The decrease in donor fluorescence was calculated from FRETC values using the conversion coefficient G (3.2 in all experiments) as described (22Gordon G.W. Berry G. Liang X.H. Levine B. Herman B. Biophys. J. 1998; 74: 2702-2713Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (720) Google Scholar) and was found to be about 5–10% of CFP fluorescence intensities. Therefore, the underestimation did not significantly affect FRETN values. Because FRETN displays a non-linear dependence when donor or acceptor are in a significant molar excess over each other, FRETN values were calculated in the sub-regions of the cell in which the amount of the donor did not exceed the amount of the acceptor more than 2-fold and vice versa. FRETC images are presented in pseudocolor mode. FRETC intensity is displayed stretched between the low and high renormalization values, according to a temperature-based lookup table with blue (cold) indicating low values and red (hot) indicating hot values. To eliminate the distracting data from regions outside of cells, the YFP channel was used as a saturation channel, and the FRETC images are displayed as YFP intensity-modulated images. In these images, data with YFP values greater than the high threshold of the saturation channel are displayed at full saturation, whereas data values below the low threshold are displayed with no saturation (i.e. black). All calculations were performed using the Channel Math and FRET modules of the SlideBook software. Characterization of CFP-DAT and YFP-DAT—To visualize DAT in living cells, fusion proteins of full-length DAT with YFP or CFP were generated, in which YFP or CFP was fused to the amino terminus of DAT (Fig. 1A). Previous studies reported that the fusion of GFP or YFP to the amino terminus of DAT did not affect functional properties of the transporter (3Daniels G.M. Amara S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35794-35801Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar, 23Carvelli L. Moron J.A. Kahlig K.M. Ferrer J.V. Sen N. Lechleiter J.D. Leeb-Lundberg L.M. Merrill G.

YFP-DAT and CFP-DAT were transiently or stably expressed in PAE cells. PAE cells have been our preferred cell line for fluorescence microscopic analyses, because these cells are flattened and have minimal background autofluorescence, which allows clear visualization of organelles in living cells by wide-field microscopy. The presence of functional transporters in PAE cells stably expressing YFP/CFP-DAT was confirmed by measurements of [3H]DA uptake. All cell lines exhibited specific [3H]DA uptake (Fig. 1B), defined as the difference between [3H]DA uptake in the absence and presence of 1 mm cocaine. Kinetic analysis confirmed that each cell line contained high affinity, cocaine-sensitive [3H]DA uptake with K m values in the range of 2–16 μm. CFP-DAT was expressed in PAE cells at higher levels than YFP or untagged DAT and thus tended to yield higher K m values. Importantly, however, K m values measured in PAE cells expressing YFP-DAT, CFP-DAT, or untagged DAT were not consistently different from each other (Fig. 1B) and were similar to values measured in our previous work with DAT expressed in Xenopus oocytes (24Doolen S. Zahniser N.R. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2001; 296: 931-938PubMed Google Scholar). The plasma membrane expression of DAT fusion proteins in PAE cells was confirmed by surface biotinylation assays using a membrane-impermeable derivative of biotin. Biotinylated untagged DAT and YFP-DAT migrated on SDS-PAGE as smeared bands of ∼73–75 kDa and 103–105 kDa (the difference corresponds to ∼26 kDa of YFP), respectively (Fig. 1C). Minor biotinylated bands of ∼180–190 kDa for DAT and ∼250 kDa for YFP-DAT were also detected. These forms may represent SDS-resistant dimers of DAT and YFP-DAT, correspondingly. Several species of DAT and YFP-DAT were also detected in the supernatants from the NeutrAvidin affinity column. The non-biotinylated forms, which migrated similar to the biotinylated forms, are likely to correspond to surface-exposed DAT (especially, in the case of YFP-DAT) that were not biotinylated due to the limited efficiency of biotinylation or internalized, endosomal DAT. Other forms with molecular weights different from the surface forms probably represent monomeric and dimeric species of DAT and YFP-DAT located intracellularly. A 75- to 80-kDa band of YFP-DAT (IC-1) recognized by antibodies to DAT (Fig. 1C) and GFP (data not shown) represents non-glycosylated YFP-DAT. The corresponding form of DAT (50 kDa) was poorly detected because of the overlap with IgG, but was clearly detectable in cell lysates (data not shown). A 180- to 190-kDa form (IC-2) may correspond to SDS-resistant dimers of IC-1 (Fig. 1C). That YFP- and CFP-DAT were efficiently transported along the biosynthetic pathway to the cell surface was also demonstrated by fluorescence microscopy. Fig. 2 shows that CFP-DAT and YFP-DAT co-expressed in PAE cells were mainly localized in the plasma membrane, often concentrating in ruffle- and phylopodia-like structures (Fig. 2). In addition, a pool of fluorescent DAT could be also seen in the perinuclear and Golgi area of many cells. These transporters probably represent newly synthesized YFP/CFP-DAT located in the ER and Golgi complex. FRET between CFP-DAT and YFP-DAT—DA uptake and cell surface biotinylation experiments validated the use of YFP-DAT and CFP-DAT expressed in PAE cells to examine the oligomeric state of these proteins in various cellular compartments. In previous studies we described a three-filter method of FRET microscopic analysis in living cells (19Sorkin A. McClure M. Huang F. Carter R. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 1395-1398Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). This method allows rapid measurement of sensitized FRET signals with high spatial resolution. Fig. 2A shows that positive CFP → YFP FRETC signals were detecte"
https://openalex.org/W2026885876,"The inhibition of apoptosis is generally believed to be a major determinant of resistance to chemotherapy. However, recent findings have shown that caspase inhibitors do not protect cancer cells from death by cytotoxic agents, but may switch drug-induced apoptosis to an alternative 'default death'. The primary goals of this study were to determine the major characteristics of the 'default death' and the mechanism by which this switch is activated. For this purpose, we first investigated putative cell death modes induced by doxorubicin. Molecular markers associated with these death modes were utilized to identify the default death resulting from the inhibition of apoptosis. Our findings demonstrated that doxorubicin induced at least three distinct types of cell death, senescence, apoptosis and a type of necrosis, which were concentration dependent. Specific molecular markers such as p21/WAF1, activated caspase-3 and activated Akt were associated with these death modes. The pan-caspase inhibitor (Q-VD-OPH) greatly reduced doxorubicin-induced caspase-3 activation but did not protect cells against drug toxicity. The combination of doxorubicin and Q-VD-OPH caused an increased expression of p21/WAF1 and senescence -associated -beta-galactosidase activity, but did not alter Akt activation. Collectively, these findings suggest that the inhibition of apoptosis may lead to an increased expression of cell cycle inhibitors and cellular senescence."
https://openalex.org/W2151209811,"The ABC transporter Mdl1p, a structural and functional homologue of the transporter associated with antigen processing (TAP) plays an important role in intracellular peptide transport from the mitochondrial matrix of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. To characterize the ATP hydrolysis cycle of Mdl1p, the nucleotide-binding domain (NBD) was overexpressed in Escherichia coli and purified to homogeneity. The isolated NBD was active in ATP binding and hydrolysis with a turnover of 25 ATP per minute and a K m of 0.6 mm and did not show cooperativity in ATPase activity. However, the ATPase activity was non-linearly dependent on protein concentration (Hill coefficient of 1.7), indicating that the functional state is a dimer. Dimeric catalytic transition states could be trapped either by incubation with orthovanadate or beryllium fluoride, or by mutagenesis of the NBD. The nucleotide composition of trapped intermediate states was determined using [α-32P]ATP and [γ-32P]ATP. Three different dimeric intermediate states were isolated, containing either two ATPs, one ATP and one ADP, or two ADPs. Based on these experiments, it was shown that: (i) ATP binding to two NBDs induces dimerization, (ii) in all isolated dimeric states, two nucleotides are present, (iii) phosphate can dissociate from the dimer, (iv) both nucleotides are hydrolyzed, and (v) hydrolysis occurs in a sequential mode.

Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1992; 8: 67-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (3364) Google Scholar). The function of ABC transporters is central to various human pathologies such as cystic fibrosis, adrenoleukodystrophy, retinal dystrophies, and multidrug resistance. The transporter associated with antigen processing (TAP) is an ABC transporter in vertebrates, which translocates peptides from the cytosol into the ER and performs a key function in the antigen presentation and adaptive immune response (2Lankat-Buttgereit B. Tampé R. Physiol. Rev. 2002; 82: 187-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Recently, a close homologue, Mdl1p (multidrug resistance like), localized in the inner mitochondrial membrane of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, has been identified as an intracellular peptide transporter (3Young L. Leonhard K. Tatsuta T. Trowsdale J. Langer T. Science. 2001; 291: 2135-2138Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). This transporter exports peptides derived from the degradation of non-assembled membrane proteins. These peptides are generated by ATP-dependent m-AAA (matrix-oriented ATPases associated with a variety of cellular activities) proteases, which mediate the degradation and turnover of inner mitochondrial membrane proteins and short-lived regulatory proteins in an ubiquitin/proteasome-independent manner (4Arnold I. Langer T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1592: 89Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Protein fragments with a length of 6–21 amino acids are released by Mdl1p into the intermembrane space (3Young L. Leonhard K. Tatsuta T. Trowsdale J. Langer T. Science. 2001; 291: 2135-2138Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Half-size ABC transporters, like the heterodimeric TAP and homodimeric Mdl1p, have a common molecular architecture consisting of two polytopic transmembrane domains (TMD) and two nucleotide-binding domains (NBD). The transmembrane domains interact with the substrates and form the substrate translocation pore across the membrane. The TMDs generally share little homology (5Holland I.B. Blight M.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 293: 381-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (489) Google Scholar), probably caused by the broad substrate spectrum of the ABC transporter family. Binding and hydrolysis of nucleotides drive the transport process by transducing conformational changes from the NBDs to the TMDs. The similarity of different NBDs is significantly higher compared with the TMDs, suggesting that even in transporters of unrelated function the structure and function of the NBDs be highly conserved. Each NBD contains a highly conserved Walker A and Walker B motif (6Walker J.E. Saraste M. Gay N.J. Nature. 1982; 298: 867-869Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) characteristic of ATP-binding P-loop proteins, as well as the C-loop motif (LSGGQ) unique to ABC proteins, which is also known as the ABC signature motif. The crystal structures of bacterial ABC transporters (e.g. MsbA, BtuCD) and of isolated NBDs (e.g. HisP, MalK, MJ1276, and TAP1) show a consensus fold for the monomer (7Hung L.W. Wang I.X. Nikaido K.

The crystal structures of several NBD dimers have been solved, but they differ significantly in the manner the monomers are associated (15Schmitt L. Tampé R. Curr. Opin. Struct.

The crystal structure of the ATP-bound Rad50 dimer, a DNA repair enzyme that shares homology with the NBDs of ABC proteins is assumed to be the physiologically relevant dimer. This dimer contains two nucleotides, which are clamped at the interface between two monomers causing them to dimerize in a head-to-tail manner (17Hopfner K.P. Karcher A. Shin D.S. Craig L.

Science. 2002; 296: 1091-1098Crossref PubMed Scopus (932) Google Scholar). Biochemical data on NBDs like MalK or of P-gp further confirmed the involvement of the C-loop in ATP binding (18Fetsch E.E.

The dimer is generally regarded as the ATPase active form of ABC transporters, but it remains controversial at which point of the transport cycle the dimer is formed and how both NBDs cooperate. Whether the motor domains work as equivalent modules, hydrolyzing both ATP synchronously, sequentially or alternatively is still under discussion. It is also not clarified how ATP hydrolysis powers the substrate translocation. Based on the P-gp ATPase cycle, it was suggested that hydrolysis of one ATP provides energy for the translocation of the substrate whereas hydrolysis of the ATP in the second binding pocket might have regulatory functions, possibly returning the complex to the starting point of the ATPase cycle (20Hrycyna C.A.

Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 13989-14000Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). To obtain insight into the mechanism of the NBDs, we expressed and purified the NBD of Mdl1p. Either by incubation with orthovanadate or beryllium fluoride, or by mutagenesis of the NBD, catalytic transition states were trapped and the nucleotide composition of these states was analyzed. Based on these results, we propose a new model for the ATPase cycle combining structure and function of the ABC dimer. Heterologous Expression of Mdl1p-NBD in Escherichia coli—The C-terminal domain (amino acids 423–695) of Mdl1p (ORF YLR188W) was amplified by PCR on genomic DNA of S. cerevisiae using the following primers: 5′-TCCGACTATTGGAAAGGATCCTGTGTC-3′; 5′-TACTCGAGAAGCTTTATACTTCC CGGGCAACACTAT-3′ and cloned into the BamHI and HindIII sites of pET28b (Novagen). The resulting plasmid (pET-NBD) includes the NBD with an N-terminal His6 tag, a thrombin cleavage site and a T7 tag encoded by the vector. A conserved glutamate (E599Q, GAA->CAA) one amino acid downstream of the Walker B motif was changed to glutamine via PCR mutagenesis resulting in pET-NBD(E599Q). E. coli strain BL21(DE3) (Novagen) was transformed with the plasmids and grown in LB medium with 50 μg/ml kanamycin at 30 °C. At an OD600 of 0.5 the cells were induced with 0.2 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside, and after 3 h the cells were harvested by centrifugation. Purification of Mdl1p-NBD—The cell pellet was resuspended in lysis buffer (PBS: 10 mm Na2HPO4/NaH2PO4, pH 7.6, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl), 20 mm imidazole containing 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonylfluoride, 1% lysozyme, and 5–10 units of benzonase (Merck) and disrupted by French press treatment at 1,000 p.s.i. After centrifugation for 30 min at 100,000 × g, the supernatant was applied on a Ni-IDA column (Amersham Biosciences) preequilibrated in PBS supplemented with 20 mm imidazole. The column was washed with step gradients of 80 and 100 mm imidazole in PBS, and the protein was eluted with 250 mm imidazole. Fractions containing the NBD were pooled, concentrated by Centricon 10 (Millipore), and applied to a Superdex 200 HR 26/60 prep grade gel filtration column (Amersham Biosciences) in 20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl. The NBD eluted with an apparent molecular weight of 33 kDa corresponding to the size of the monomer. Fractions were concentrated to 10 mg/ml and stored at 4 °C. Wild-type and mutant proteins were purified to greater than 99% homogeneity as assessed by Coomassie-stained protein on SDS-PAGE (15%) and MALDI-TOF MS. 8-Azido-ATP Photolabeling—After preincubation of the purified NBD (0.3 μm) with different concentrations of nucleoside tri/diphosphates for 5 min in binding buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm MnCl2) on ice, 8-azido-[α-32P]ATP was added to a final concentration of 0.5 μm and incubation was continued on ice for 5 min. Samples were irradiated by UV (254 nm) for 5 min, directly resuspended in SDS loading buffer, and separated by 15% SDS-PAGE. The gel was dried and quantified by phosphor imaging. The data were fitted to the Hill equation y = (axn/(bn + xn)), resulting both for ATP and ADP in a best fit (R 2 = 0.98) with a Hill coefficient (n) of 1. ATPase Assay—ATPase activities were measured by the malachite green assay as described previously (22Morbach S. Tebbe S. Schneider E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 18617-18621Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The ATPase assay was performed in 20 mm Tris, pH 9.0, 100 mm NaCl and 15 mm MgCl2 with 0–150 μm NBD for either 2 min at 16 °C (high NBD concentrations) or 4 min at 30 °C. The reaction was started by the addition of ATP to final concentrations of 0 to 10 mm. Data were fitted to the Hill equation y = (axn /(bn + xn)). The ATPase activity of the E599Q mutant was determined using radiolabeled ATP. Shortly, E599Q NBD (250 μm) was incubated in 20 mm Tris, pH 9.0, 100 mm NaCl, and 15 mm MgCl2 at 30 °C. The reaction was started by addition of 2 mm MgATP supplemented with 0.04 μm [γ-32P]ATP (4500 Ci/mmol, ICN). Samples were taken at different time points (0–200 min), separated by thin layer chromatography (see below) and the rate of released radioactive phosphate was quantified by a phosphorimager. As a negative control, spontaneous ATP hydrolysis was tested in the presence of heat-inactivated NBD. Dimerization Assays—Before use, orthovanadate stock solution adjusted to pH 8.0 was boiled for 5 min to break polymeric species (23Urbatsch I.L. Sankaran B. Weber J. Senior A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19383-19390Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar). Before use, beryllium fluoride solution was prepared by mixing BeCl2 and NaF in a ratio of 1:100. For non-radioactive assays, purified wild-type NBD (30 μm) was incubated with different concentrations of beryllium fluoride (BeFx) or orthovanadate in the presence or absence of nucleotides and nucleotide analogues for 5 min at 30 °C in binding buffer. The mutant NBD (E599Q, 30 μm) was incubated for 5 min under non-hydrolyzing conditions (in the absence of Mg2+ and on ice) or ATP hydrolysis conditions (in the presence of 5 mm Mg2+ and at 30 °C) with different concentrations of nucleotides and nucleotide analogues. The samples were applied to a Superdex 75 PC 3.2 (Amersham Biosciences) gel filtration column at a flow rate of 50 μl/min at 4 °C in 20 mm, Tris pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, and 5 mm MgCl2 if indicated. Determination of the Nucleotide Stoichiometry—Radioactive trapping experiments, were performed in the same buffer as non-radioactive trapping experiments, and separated by gel filtration. Fractions were analyzed by β-counting, thin layer chromatography, and for protein concentration by the BCA assay (Pierce). Over the range of protein concentrations used, the A 280 measured with the UV detector of the SMART system (Amersham Biosciences) was linearly related to the protein concentration determined by the BCA assay. In particular, wild-type NBD (250 μm) was incubated with 500 μm MgATP supplemented with 0.1 μm of either [α-32P]ATP or [γ-32P]ATP (4500 Ci/mmol, ICN) in the presence of BeFx (500 μm) for 5 min at 30 °C. The E599Q mutant (250 μm) was incubated for 5 min in the absence of Mg2+ and on ice. To follow one to two turnovers of the E599Q mutant, 250 μm NBD were incubated for prolonged time periods (0–500 min) at 30 °C with limiting concentration of MgATP (250–500 μm) and tracer amounts of radioactive ATP. To test whether ADP is incorporated in the dimer at a high ADP concentration, the E599Q mutant was incubated with 500 μm ADP and 0.1 μm [α-32P]ADP in the presence of various concentration of unlabeled ATP (0, 5, 50, 100, and 500 μm) for 10 min at 30 °C. Alternatively, incorporation of ADP under limiting concentrations of MgATP was tested by incubating the E599Q mutant (250 μm) with MgATP (250–500 μm) supplemented with tracer amounts of [α-32P]ADP at 30 °C for 400 min. The [α-32P]ADP was formed by incubation of [α-32P]ATP with hexokinase (Sigma Aldrich) according to the manufacturer's instructions, separated from hexokinase by Centricon 10 centrifugation, and full conversion to [α-32P]ADP was confirmed by TLC. Thin Layer Chromatography—The nucleotide composition of the dimer was analyzed by TLC. Immediately after gel filtration the fraction containing the dimer was incubated with 15 mm EDTA for 30 min and precipitated with trichloroacetic acid (10% w/v) for 30 min at 4 °C. After centrifugation at 20,000 × g for 5 min, the sample was neutralized with 0.5 m KHCO3, pH 8.3 and applied onto polyethylenimine cellulose plates (Merck) in 2 m formate and 250 mm LiCl. [α-32P]ATP and [γ-32P]ATP treated with hexokinase were used as references. Purification and Activity of NBD of Mdl1p—ABC transporters undergo a series of conformational changes in response to ATP binding and hydrolysis at the NBDs, and binding, transport and release of substrate at the TMDs. Various aspects of the mechanism how the motor domains of ABC transporters work can be learned from the isolated NBDs. Therefore, the NBD of the mitochondrial half-size ABC transporter Mdl1p was cloned, expressed in E. coli and purified to homogeneity (Fig. 1, left panel). About 50 mg of soluble and purified protein at 10 mg/ml was obtained from a 1-liter culture. The identity of the sample was confirmed by MALDI-TOF MS (data not shown). The activity of the isolated wild-type NBD was analyzed with respect to ATP and ADP binding using 8-azido-[α-32P]ATP photolabeling experiments. Photolabeling with 8-azido-[α-32P]ATP was specifically competed by excess of unlabeled nucleoside di/triphosphates (Fig. 2A). The IC50, roughly reflecting the K d value, was determined to be 2 μm for MgATP and 64 μm for MgADP (Fig. 2B). The absence of Mg2+ dramatically reduced the affinity of nucleotides to the NBD. The affinity for MgCTP, MgGTP, MgUTP was ∼30-fold lower compared with MgATP (data not shown). The isolated NBD was active in ATP hydrolysis (30 μm NBD, Fig. 3A) with a K m, ATP of 0.6 mm and showed no cooperativity with increasing ATP concentration (Hill coefficient of 1.0, Fig. 3A, inset). However, the ATPase activity was observed to be non-linearly dependent on protein concentration. The specific ATPase activity increased over two orders of magnitude at higher protein concentrations. At concentrations higher than 250 μm the NBD precipitated. Based on a V max of 25 ATP/NBD/min, a K 0.5 NBD of 75 μm and a Hill coefficient of 1.7 (Fig. 3B, inset) were determined, suggesting that the active form of the enzyme is a dimer. Also at low (5 μm) and high (150 μm) NBD concentrations, the K m, ATP was 0.6 mm and showed no cooperativity with increasing ATP concentration (data not shown). The NBD had a maximal ATPase activity at a pH of 8–9 (data not shown), comparable to the pH of the mitochondrial matrix.Fig. 28-Azido-[α-32P]ATP photolabeling of purified wild-type NBD of Mdl1p.

Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 9609-9610Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). So far, gel filtration experiments with isolated NBDs (e.g. HisP or NBDs of P-gp) could not demonstrate ATP-dependent dimerization, independent of the presence of nucleotides or non-hydrolyzable analogues such as AMP-PNP (25Nikaido K. Liu P.Q. Ames G.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27745-27752Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 26Booth C.L. Pulaski L. Gottesman M.M. Pastan I. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 5518-5526Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The wild-type NBD of Mdl1p also behaved as a monomer in gel filtration studies independent of the presence of nucleotides. To analyze intermediate states of the ATPase cycle, we tried to trap the NBD in the conformation directly after ATP hydrolysis using orthovanadate (Vi) or beryllium fluoride (BeFx). As shown on myosin x-ray structures the vanadate-inhibited complex resembles a post-hydrolysis state while the complex trapped by BeFx represents a pre-hydrolysis state (27Fisher A.J. Smith C.A. Thoden J.B. Smith R. Sutoh K. Holden H.M. Rayment I. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 8960-8972Crossref PubMed Scopus (636) Google Scholar). After 5 min of preincubation of the NBD with BeFx in the presence of MgATP at 30 °C, a stable dimer corresponding to a molecular mass of 66 kDa was observed by gel filtration even in the absence of MgATP and BeFx in the mobile phase (Fig. 4A). The formation of the dimer was dependent on the concentration of BeFx. At a concentration of 1 mm BeFx almost 80% of the protein was detected as a dimer. The same result was observed with orthovanadate (Fig. 4B). Importantly, neither preincubation of the NBD with MgADP or MgAMP-PNP in the presence of BeFx/vanadate at 30 °C, nor incubation with MgATP and BeFx/vanadate at 4 °C induced dimerization of NBD. Omitting Mg2+ from the reaction inhibited the formation of dimers. This demonstrates that ATP hydrolysis is essential for the formation of the BeFx/vanadate-stabilized dimer. ATP-dependent Dimerization of the E599Q Mutant NBD— Exchange of the conserved glutamate downstream of the Walker B motif (E552Q/E1197Q) of mouse P-gp produced an ABC transporter with severely impaired biological activity and no substrate-stimulated ATPase activity (28Urbatsch I.L. Julien M. Carrier I. Rousseau M.E. Cayrol R. Gros P. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 14138-14149Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Equivalent mutation of the archaeal NBDs of MJ0796 and MJ1267 (E171Q/E179Q) induced an ATP-dependent dimerization of the NBDs (29Moody J.E. Millen L. Binns D. Hunt J.F. Thomas P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 21111-21114Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). We introduced an equivalent mutation in the conserved glutamate (E599Q) in the NBD of Mdl1p, which was expressed and purified in equal amounts as the wild-type protein (Fig. 1). The mutant NBD bound ATP to the same extent as the wild-type as analyzed by 8-azido-ATP photolabeling experiments (data not shown). As expected, no steady-state ATP hydrolysis was observed by measuring the release of Pi using the malachite green assay (data not shown). To assay the ability of the mutant to form nucleotide-dependent dimers, we incubated the mutant NBD with MgATP on ice for 5 min. Gel filtration experiments showed that MgATP induced dimerization in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 5). The E599Q NBD dimer was stable during gel filtration even without nucleotides in the mobile phase, indicating that the ATP-induced dimer only slowly dissociates. Importantly, ADP did not induce dimerization, and the addition of ADP to the monomers impaired ATP-dependent dimer formation. Addition of Mg2+ (0–5 mm) did not influence the dimerization. Furthermore, MgAMP-PNP or MgATPγS could bind to the wild-type and mutant NBD of Mdl1p to the same extent as MgATP, but did neither induce dimerization of the wild-type NBD nor of the E599Q mutant (data not shown). Based on these results we can conclude that presence of ATP is absolutely required for the formation of both wild-type and mutant dimer. Nucleotide Composition of the Dimer—To analyze the ATP/ADP composition of the nucleotide-induced dimer, wild-type NBD was incubated with tracer amount of either [α-32P]ATP or [γ-32P]ATP under BeFx-trapping conditions and applied to the gel filtration column. Radioactive nucleotides exclusively coeluted with the dimer, whereas no radioactive nucleotides were observed in fractions corresponding to the monomer (Fig. 6A). The amount of [α-32P]ATP bound per wild-type dimer was determined and a stoichiometry of two nucleotides per dimer was obtained (Fig. 6A, open circles). Trapping the NBD by BeFx in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP resulted in a dimer with almost no radioactive nucleotides incorporated (Fig. 6A, filled circles, Table I). These results demonstrate that two ATP molecules are already hydrolyzed in the BcFx-trapped wild-type dimer and the [γ-32P]i is released from the complex. This was confirmed by TLC analysis (Fig. 6A). Under the same conditions, incorporation of [α-32P]ADP into the dimer was not observed, even in the presence of different concentrations of ATP (data not shown).Table INucleotide composition of the dimer (average of 5 experiments)Nucleotide/dimerWild-type 30°C, BeFx-trappedE599Q 4°C, no Mg2+, ATPE599Q 30°C, Mg2+, limiting ATPmol/mol[γ-32P]ATP0.01 ± 0.012.50 ± 0.181.16 ± 0.06[α-32P]ATP1.76 ± 0.062.27 ± 0.152.18 ± 0.14[α-32P]ADP0.02 ± 0.02 Open table in a new tab In experiments with the E599Q mutant, performed at 4 °C and in the absence of Mg2+, the nucleotides exclusively coeluted with the dimer as well. In this experiment, the amount of both [α-32P]ATP and [γ-32P]ATP bound per dimer was equal and a stoichiometry of two ATP molecules per dimer was obtained (Fig. 6B, Table I). TLC clearly demonstrated that ATP and not ADP and Pi were incorporated into the dimer. As mentioned above, incubation with non-hydrolyzable ATP analogues did not trigger dimer formation. Our data from both the BeFx-trapped wild-type NBD and the E599Q mutant suggest that during the ATP hydrolysis cycle at least two different intermediate states can be isolated. Importantly, both states contain two nucleotides. In one state the nucleotides are bound as ATP as shown for the E599Q mutant. In the other state both nucleotides have been hydrolyzed to ADP and Pi as demonstrated for the trapped wild-type NBD. This suggests that ATP binding on both NBDs induces formation of the dimer and that after hydrolysis of both ATP molecules to ADP, the dimeric complex dissociates and ADP is released. Hydrolysis Cycle of the E599Q Mutant—An important remaining question is how the ATPs are hydrolyzed during one cycle. Using radiolabeled ATP, it was determined that the E599Q mutant,"

A further consequence of cytochrome c release is the enhanced mitochondrial production of superoxide radicals (O2·¯ ), which are converted to hydrogen peroxide by manganese-superoxide dismutase. Recently, we showed that cytochrome c is a potent catalyst of 2′,7′-dichlorofluorescin oxidation to the fluorescent 2′,7′-dichlorofluorescein by these species, leading to the conclusion that 2′,7′-dichlorofluorescein fluorescence is a reflection of cytosolic cytochrome c concentration rather than “reactive oxygen species” levels (Burkitt, M.

Several authors have suggested that the hydroxyl radical (•OH) is generated, but others have discussed the possibility of a peroxidase compound I. By examining the effects of various antioxidants (glutathione, ascorbate, and NADH) and “hydroxyl radical scavengers” (ethanol and mannitol) on the rate of 2′,7′-dichlorofluorescin oxidation by cytochrome c, together with complementary EPR spin-trapping studies, we demonstrate that the hydroxyl radical is not generated. Instead, our findings suggest the formation of a peroxidase compound I-type intermediate, in which one oxidizing equivalent is present as an oxoferryl heme species and the other as the protein tyrosyl radical previously identified (Barr, D.

Peroxynitrite, formed in the reaction between O2·¯ and nitric oxide, can oxidize DCFH2 directly (18Kooy N.W. Royall J.A. Ischiropoulous H. Free Rad. Res. 1997; 27: 245-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Recently, we demonstrated that cyt c is a particularly potent catalyst of DCFH2 oxidation in the presence of an enzymatic source of O2·¯ and H2O2 (17Burkitt M.J. Wardman P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 282: 329-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Whereas a 10-fold increase in the rate of O2·¯/H2O2 production results in only a very modest increase in the rate of DCFH2 oxidation, the addition of nanomolar amounts of the cytochrome has a profound stimulatory effect. Thus, we suggested that the increased rate of DCFH2 oxidation that is observed in apoptotic cells is a reflection of elevated cytosolic cyt c concentration rather than increased O2·¯/H2O2 /H2O2 production (17Burkitt M.J. Wardman P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 282: 329-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). The H2O2 resulting from the manganese-superoxide dismutase-catalyzed disproportionation of O2·¯ is expected to undergo glutathione peroxidase-catalyzed reduction to water, accompanied by the oxidation of GSH to GSSG (9Cadenas E. Davies K.J.A. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2000; 29: 222-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (2299) Google Scholar, 19Chance B. Sies H. Boveris A. Physiol. Rev. 1979; 59: 527-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (4764) Google Scholar). Although O2·¯ can oxidize GSH directly, the rate constant for this reaction (≈200 m–1 s–1) is too low for it to compete with the rapid conversion of O2·¯ to H2O2 by manganese-superoxide dismutase (5Jones C.M. Lawrence A. Wardman P. Burkitt M.J. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2002; 32: 982-990Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Because of the critical role of the GSH/GSSG couple in the maintenance of intracellular redox conditions (20Schafer F.Q. Buettner G.R. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2001; 30: 1191-1212Crossref PubMed Scopus (3551) Google Scholar), there is currently considerable interest in the implications of the extensive GSH oxidation that occurs during apoptosis as a consequence of the above reactions (21Bustamate J. Tovar-B A. Montero G. Boveris A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1997; 337 (A.): 121-128BCrossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 22Hampton M.B. Orrenius S. Biofactors. 1998; 8: 1-5Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 23Voehringer D.W. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1999; 27: 945-950Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar, 24Chandra J. Samali A. Orrenius S. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2000; 29: 323-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (1111) Google Scholar). For example, the activity of caspase-3, a key apoptotic enzyme that is activated following cyt c release, is known to be particularly sensitive to intracellular redox conditions, being inactivated by excessive H2O2 (11Samali A. Nordgren H. Zhivotovsky B. Peterson E. Orrenius S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 255: 6-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar, 25Hampton M.B. Orrenius S.

On the other hand, there is evidence to suggest that, at least at low concentrations, ROS play a necessary role in the induction of apoptosis. For example, through their stimulation of mitochondrial cyt c release, involving the mitochondrial permeability transition, ROS are believed to be responsible for the induction of apoptosis by a diverse range of chemical agents (24Chandra J. Samali A. Orrenius S. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2000; 29: 323-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (1111) Google Scholar, 27Atlante A. Calissano P. Bobba A. Azzariti A. Marra E. Passarella S. J. Biol.

Redox Rep. 2001; 6: 77-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar, 29Yang J.C. Cortopassi G.A. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1998; 24: 624-631Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). However, the role of ROS in apoptosis is a contentious issue, with some studies reporting that they are not required (30Jacobsen M.D. Raff M.C. Nature. 1995; 374: 814-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (634) Google Scholar, 31Muschel R.J. Bernhard E.J. Garza L. McKenna W.G. Kock C.J. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 995-998PubMed Google Scholar, 32Jacobsen M.D. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 83-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (635) Google Scholar). Indeed, it is now apparent that cyt c release from mitochondria can occur by two distinct mechanisms, only one of which appears to involve the permeability transition (33Gogvadze V. Robertson J.D. Zhivotovsky B. Orrenius S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 19066-19071Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Moreover, a recent study found that the oxidation of externalized phosphatidylserine by ROS plays a role in the recognition and clearance of apoptotic cells by macrophages (34Kagan V.E. Gleiss B. Tyurina Y.Y. Tyurin V.A. Elenström-Magnusson C. Liu S.-X. Serinkan F.B. Arroyo A. Chandra J. Orrenius S. Fadeel B. J. Immunol. 2002; 169: 487-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). Clearly, to elucidate the exact role played by such species in apoptosis and other cellular events, it is of vital importance that the observations from experiments employing indicator probes such as DCFH2 are interpreted with extreme caution. For example, on the strength of its ability to suppress the oxidation of DCFH2 in dying cells, it has been suggested that the Bcl-2 oncoprotein is an antioxidant (10Kane D.J. Sarafian T.A. Anton R. Hahn H. Gralla E.B. Valentine J.S. Örd T. Bredesen D.E. Science. 1993; 262: 1274-1277Crossref PubMed Scopus (1613) Google Scholar), yet this observation can be accounted for solely by the fact that the protein prevents the release of cyt c from mitochondria (17Burkitt M.J. Wardman P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 282: 329-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). In the apoptotic cell, there is also the possibility that cyt c may catalyze the oxidation of GSH (and other molecules) by hydrogen peroxide, which may have implications for the redox-sensitive events that occur downstream of cyt c release (35Pan Z. Voehringer D.W. Meyn R.E. Cell Death Differ. 1999; 6: 683-688Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The purpose of the investigations reported here was to examine in mechanistic detail, using biomimetic models, the interactions that can occur between cyt c, O2·¯/H2O2 , DCFH2, GSH, and other redox cofactors in the apoptotic cell. On the basis of our findings, we have proposed a mechanism for the activation of cyt c to an oxidizing species in the presence of O2·¯/H2O2 and elucidated the mechanism of its interaction with DCFH2, GSH, NADH, and ascorbate. We propose that these reactions explain many of the redox changes observed in apoptotic cells. Although we accept that there is good evidence that ROS act as signaling species in the induction of apoptosis, our findings suggest that the redox changes reported in the literature occur largely as a consequence of apoptosis and probably serve to inactivate the process, favoring a shift toward a necrotic mode of cell death. Materials—Horse heart cytochrome c, ascorbic acid, DCF, 2′,7′-dichlorofluorescin diacetate, ferrous sulfate, NADH, chelating resin (Chelex 100), MOPS buffer, GSH, GSSG, DTPA, 5,5-dimethyl-1-pyrroline N-oxide (DMPO), hypoxanthine, 2-methyl-2-nitrosopropane (MNP), and xanthine oxidase (XO) were purchased from Sigma (Poole, UK). DCFH2 was prepared from 2′,7′-dichlorofluorescin diacetate by alkaline hydrolysis (13LeBel C.P. Ischiropoulos H. Bondy S.C. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1992; 5: 227-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (2190) Google Scholar). The spin trap DMPO was purified by vacuum distillation (Kugelrohr) and stored under N2 at –80 °C. Sodium dihydrogen phosphate and disodium hydrogen phosphate were from BDH (Poole). Stock solutions of 0.2 m phosphate buffer and 0.2 MOPS buffer (both pH 7.4), as well as the hypoxanthine stock solution and water used in all dilutions, were treated with chelating resin to remove contaminating metal ions using the batch method (36Buettner G.R. J. Biochem. Biophys. Methods. 1988; 16: 27-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar). Hydrogen peroxide was purchased from Aldrich (Gillingham, UK) as a 27.5% weight solution and standardized by titration against a 0.1 n potassium permanganate standard solution, the concentration of which was routinely checked by titration against sodium oxalate (both from Aldrich) (37Belcher R. Nutten A.J. Quantitative Inorganic Analysis. 3rd ed. Butterworths, London1970Google Scholar). For EPR experiments requiring both ferricytochrome c and ferrocytochrome c (see Fig. 8), a 25 mm stock solution of the cytochrome in 0.1 m phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) was divided into two aliquots. To one aliquot was added ascorbic acid (in phosphate buffer adjusted to pH 7.4) to give cyt c and ascorbic acid final concentrations of 18.75 and 50 mm, respectively. The other aliquot was diluted to 18.75 mm with phosphate buffer. Both solutions were then incubated on ice for 2 h before purification through Micro Bio-Spin columns (Bio-Gel P-6, Bio-Rad, Hemel Hempstead, UK). An aliquot of the eluant from the ascorbate-reduced cyt c was then diluted using 200 mm ascorbic acid (in N2-purged phosphate buffer), and its concentration was determined from the resultant absorbance at 550 nm (ϵ = 27,700 m–1 cm–1). The original eluant was then used for reaction with H2O2, as indicated in the legend to Fig. 8B (cyt c-FeII). For the corresponding reaction using cyt c-FeIII (Fig. 8A), the eluant from the column loaded with cyt c that had not been reduced with ascorbate was used. To ensure that an identical concentration of cyt c-FeIII was used, a small aliquot of the eluant was reduced by the addition of solid sodium dithionite, and the absorbance at 550 nm was measured. Fluorescence Assay of DCFH 2 Oxidation—The generation of DCF from DCFH2 was monitored by fluorescence spectroscopy as reported previously (17Burkitt M.J. Wardman P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 282: 329-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). All incubations contained 10 μm DCFH2, which was incubated either with 4 milliunits/ml XO and 0.5 mm hypoxanthine (to generate superoxide plus hydrogen peroxide) or with 250 μm H2O2. Reactions using the XO/hypoxanthine system were performed in 0.1 m MOPS buffer (pH 7.4) containing 1 mm DTPA. Reactions involving bolus H2O2 addition were performed in 0.1 m phosphate buffer (pH 7.4). Other reagents were included as specified in the appropriate figure legends. Reactions were initiated by the final addition of cyt c at the concentrations indicated. Fluorescence values were converted to DCF concentrations using a standard curve prepared using known amounts of DCF. Data shown are representative of at least three independent experiments. Electron Paramagnetic Resonance Spectroscopy—EPR spectra were recorded on a Bruker EMX spectrometer equipped with a high sensitivity cylindrical cavity (X-band) and operating at a modulation frequency of 100 kHz with the settings specified in the appropriate figure legends. All reaction mixtures were prepared in Eppendorf tubes and transferred to a quartz flat cell following the final addition of cyt c. The spectrometer field calibration was routinely checked using the signal from a dilute solution of Fremy's salt (a N = 13.091 G) (38Faber R.J. Fraenkel G.K. J. Chem. Phys. 1967; 47: 2462-2476Crossref Scopus (176) Google Scholar) and was accurate to within ±0.05 G. Hyperfine coupling constants (in gauss; 1 G = 104 tesla) were determined from spectral simulations performed using software available through the Internet 2Available at epr.niehs.nih.gov/. and described elsewhere (39Duling D. J. Magn. Reson. 1994; 104: 105-110Crossref Scopus (885) Google Scholar). To mimic the production of O2·¯ radicals by cyt c-depleted mitochondria, we used XO with hypoxanthine as substrate. The incubation of DCFH2 with XO led to the generation of only a very modest amount of DCF over the 25-min recording period (Fig. 1, trace a). However, the inclusion of 25 nm cyt c resulted in a massive enhancement of the rate of DCFH2 oxidation (Fig. 1, trace e), as reported previously (17Burkitt M.J. Wardman P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 282: 329-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). The ability of cyt c to catalyze DCFH2 oxidation was severely compromised when GSH was included at a concentration of 7.5 mm (Fig. 1, trace c), which is typical of reported intracellular concentrations (40Wahlländer A. Soboll S. Sies H. FEBS Lett. 1979; 97: 138-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar, 41Meister A. Larson A. Orrenius S. Holmgren A. Mannervik B.

Richelmi P. Orrenius S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 4412-4416Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). Moreover, the addition of GSH without the cytochrome led to a moderate increase in the rate of DCFH2 oxidation by XO (Fig. 1, trace b), which accounted for essentially all of the DCF generated when the cyt c was added together with the thiol (Fig. 1, trace c). Much higher concentrations of cyt c were needed to stimulate DCFH2 oxidation in the presence of GSH. For example, at a concentration of 250 nm, which is representative of the concentrations needed to trigger the final stages of apoptosis (43Li P. Nijhawan D. Budihardjo I. Srinivasula S.M. Ahmad M. Alnemri E.S. Wang X. Cell. 1997; 91: 479-489Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6157) Google Scholar, 44Zhivotosky B. Orrenius S. Brustugun O.T. Døskeland S.O.

EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2040-2048Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar), the cytochrome caused almost a 3-fold increase in the yield of DCF after 25 min (Fig. 1, traces b and d). Because GSH is known to undergo oxidation to GSSG during apoptosis (1Cai J. Jones D.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11401-11404Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (716) Google Scholar), it was considered appropriate to examine the ability of cyt c to oxidize DCFH2 in the presence of both GSH and GSSG at concentrations reflecting those achieved in apoptotic cells following release of the cytochrome into the cytosol. Cellular levels of GSH and GSSG are often reported in terms of a redox potential (1Cai J. Jones D.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11401-11404Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (716) Google Scholar, 20Schafer F.Q. Buettner G.R. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2001; 30: 1191-1212Crossref PubMed Scopus (3551) Google Scholar, 46Kirlin W.G. Cai J. Thompson S.A. Diaz D. Kavanagh T.J. Jones D.P. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1999; 27: 1208-1218Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). This gives a more accurate reflection of the prevailing redox environment in the cell than the simple ratio [GSH]/[GSSG] (even though the couple is not at thermodynamic equilibrium because of the participation of GSH and GSSG in other reactions). The reduction potential for the GSSG/2GSH couple at pH 7.0 and 40 °C is –0.24 ± 0.01V (47Rost J. Rapoport S. Nature. 1964; 201: 185Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar), from which a value of –0.26 V is obtained at pH 7.4 (48Jones D.P. Carlson J.L. Mody Jr., V.C. Cai J. Lynn M.J. Sternberg Jr., P. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2000; 28: 625-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (477) Google Scholar). It is reasonable to assume that the glutathione solution used in the experiments reported in Fig. 1 initially contained 0.5–1.0% GSSG (47Rost J. Rapoport S. Nature. 1964; 201: 185Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Using the Nernst equation (49Wardman P.W. J. Phys. Chem. Ref. Data. 1989; 18: 1637-1755Crossref Scopus (1712) Google Scholar), E h = E′0 + {(RT/nF) × ln([GSSG]/[GSH]2)}, in which E′0 is the reduction potential for the GSSG/2GSH couple at pH 7.4 and 40 °C under standard conditions of concentration (approximating 1 m GSH and 1 m GSSG) and E h is the corresponding potential (half-cell potential) at particular values of [GSH] and [GSSG], it can be shown that the E h of a 7.5 mm glutathione solution that has undergone 1% oxidation to GSSG is approximately –0.27 V. We examined the ability of cyt c to catalyze DCFH2 oxidation in the presence of glutathione that had undergone 25, 50, and 75% oxidation. This was achieved by mixing stock solutions of GSH and GSSG, keeping the total concentration of GSH equivalents ([GSH] + 2[GSSG]) constant at 7.5 mm. The resultant E h values estimated for these GSH/GSSG mixtures were calculated to be –0.22 V (25% GSH oxidation), –0.20 V (50% GSH oxidation), and –0.17 V (75% GSH oxidation), which, together with the “1%” oxidized solution, broadly encompass the range of values reported for the GSSG/2GSH couple in cells undergoing proliferation (≤–0.24 V), differentiation (≈–0.20 V), and apoptosis (≥–0.17 V) (20Schafer F.Q. Buettner G.R. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2001; 30: 1191-1212Crossref PubMed Scopus (3551) Google Scholar, 46Kirlin W.G. Cai J. Thompson S.A. Diaz D. Kavanagh T.J. Jones D.P. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1999; 27: 1208-1218Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2, the ability of cyt c to stimulate the oxidation DCFH2 was directly related to the extent of glutathione oxidation. Indeed, under conditions that mimic the redox environment of the apoptotic cell, cyt c caused a severalfold increase in the rate of DCFH2 oxidation (Fig. 2D). The ability of GSH at a fixed concentration of 7.5 mm to inhibit the generation of DCF could be overcome by increasing the concentration of DCFH2 (Fig. 3). This suggests that GSH and DCFH2 compete for oxidation by a common cyt c-derived oxidant. The inhibition of DCFH2 oxidation shown in Fig. 2A is therefore a reflection of the failure of the probe (10 μm) to compete with GSH (7.5 mm) for reaction with this oxidant. Separate experiments showed that high concentrations of GSSG also inhibited DCFH2 oxidation, which is believed to be because of its inhibition of XO, presumably via mixed disulfide formation (data not shown). It was noted above that, in the absence of cyt c, GSH actually stimulated the oxidation of DCFH2, albeit at a modest rate (Fig. 1, trace b), accounting for most of the DCF generated when the cytochrome was added together with 7.5 mm GSH (trace c). Additional experiments showed that, at this concentration of DCFH2 (10 μm), the maximum rate of DCF oxidation occurred at a GSH concentration of 1 mm, beyond which the addition of further thiol had no effect (data not shown). The stimulation of DCFH2 oxidation by GSH alone was suppressed by superoxide dismutase (data not shown), suggesting the direct involvement of XO-derived superoxide radicals (5Jones C.M. Lawrence A. Wardman P. Burkitt M.J. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2002; 32: 982-990Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). We next sought to identify the oxidant responsible for the oxidation of DCFH2 in the presence of cyt c. The most likely candidates are the hydroxyl radical (•OH), an oxoferryl heme species (cyt c-FeIV=O), and an oxoferryl heme species with a second oxidizing equivalent existing as a porphyrin or protein radical cation (cytc·+-FeIV=O ), as encountered in the compound I form of peroxidases (50Radi R. Turrens J.F. Freeman B.A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1991; 288: 118-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 51Ferri A. Calza R. Biochem. Mol. Biol. Int. 1995; 35: 691-697PubMed Google Scholar, 52Barr D.P. Gunther M.R. Deterding L.J. Tomer K.B. Mason R.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15498-15503Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 53Dunford H.B. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1987; 3: 405-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). The fact that DCFH2 oxidation occurs at all in the presence of a 104-fold excess of organic buffer and a 50-fold excess of hypoxanthine argues against the role of the free •OH radical: if the rate constant for the reaction of •OH with these substrates is assumed to be ≈109m–1 s–1 (54Buxton G.V. Greenstock C.L. Helman W.P. Ross A.B. J. Phys. Chem. Ref. Data. 1988; 17: 513-886Crossref Scopus (9496) Google Scholar), then it is difficult to see how DCFH2 could ever compete for oxidation by the radical. To investigate DCFH2 oxidation in the absence of competing organic substrates (including DTPA), additional reactions were carried out in phosphate buffer using a bolus of H2O2 in place of XO. The incubation of DCFH2 with H2O2 and cyt c in phosphate buffer resulted in efficient DCF generation (Fig. 4, trace e). As seen with the XO system in MOPS buffer, the addition of GSH resulted in the marked inhibition of DCFH2 oxidation (Fig. 4, trace b), as did ascorbate and NADH (traces a and c, respectively). In contrast, the classical hydroxyl radical scavengers mannitol and ethanol had essentially no effect on the rate of DCF generation (Fig. 4, traces d and f, respectively). To provide direct evidence for the interception of an oxidizing species by the above scavengers, complementary EPR studies were performed. With the exception of ascorbate, which is oxidized to a relatively stable radical that is detectable by direct EPR spectroscopy (55Ohnishi T. Yamazaki H. Iyanagi T. Nakamura T. Yamazaki I. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1969; 172: 357-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar), the spin trap DMPO was employed. Upon reaction with a short-lived radical (R•), DMPO is converted to a nitroxide radical adduct (Reaction 1), which is relatively long-lived and yields a spectrum that can be used to identify the trapped radical (56Buettner G.R. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1987; 3: 259-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (1496) Google Scholar). The addition of cyt c together with H2O2 to DMPO caused the appearance of a prominent signal from 5,5-dimethyl-1-pyrrolidone-2-oxyl (DMPOX), the 3-electron oxidation product of the spin tra"
https://openalex.org/W1964460778,"Regions of hypoxia are a hallmark of solid tumors. Tumor cells modulate the regulation of specific genes allowing adaptation and survival in the harsh hypoxic environment. We have identified SKIP3, a novel human kinase-like gene, which is overexpressed in multiple human tumors and is regulated by hypoxia. SKIP3 is an ortholog of the Drosophila tribbles, rat NIPK, dog C5FW, and human C8FW genes. Drosophila tribbles is involved in slowing cell-cycle progression during Drosophila development, but little is known regarding the function or tissue distribution of the vertebrate orthologs. We show that the normal tissue expression of SKIP3 is confined to human liver, while multiple primary human lung, colon, and breast tumors express high levels of SKIP3 transcript. Endogenous SKIP3 protein accumulates within 48 h under hypoxic growth conditions in HT-29 and PC-3 cells, with upregulation of the SKIP3 mRNA transcript by 72 h. We identified activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4) as a SKIP3-binding partner using the yeast-two-hybrid assay. Coexpression of SKIP3 and ATF4 showed that SKIP3 is associated with the proteolysis of ATF4, which can be blocked using a proteosome inhibitor. These results indicate that SKIP3 may be an important participant in tumor cell growth."
https://openalex.org/W2145651018,"Aminopeptidase regulator of TNFR1 shedding (ARTS-1) binds to the type I tumor necrosis factor receptor (TNFR1) and promotes receptor shedding. Because hydroxamic acid-based metalloprotease inhibitors prevent shedding of both TNFR1 and the interleukin-6 receptor (IL-6Rα), we hypothesized that ARTS-1 might also regulate shedding of IL-6Rα, a member of the type I cytokine receptor superfamily that is structurally different from TNFR1. Reciprocal co-immunoprecipitation experiments identified that membrane-associated ARTS-1 directly binds to a 55-kDa IL-6Rα, a size consistent with soluble IL-6Rα generated by ectodomain cleavage of the membrane-bound receptor. Furthermore, ARTS-1 promoted IL-6Rα shedding, as demonstrated by a direct correlation between increased membrane-associated ARTS-1 protein, increased IL-6Rα shedding, and decreased membrane-associated IL-6Rα in cell lines overexpressing ARTS-1. The absence of basal IL-6Rα shedding from arts-1 knock-out cells identified that ARTS-1 was required for constitutive IL-6Rα shedding. Furthermore, the mechanism of constitutive IL-6Rα shedding requires ARTS-1 catalytic activity. Thus, ARTS-1 promotes the shedding of two cytokine receptor superfamilies, the type I cytokine receptor superfamily (IL-6Rα) and the TNF receptor superfamily (TNFR1). We propose that ARTS-1 is a multifunctional aminopeptidase that may modulate inflammatory events by promoting IL-6Rα and TNFR1 shedding. Aminopeptidase regulator of TNFR1 shedding (ARTS-1) binds to the type I tumor necrosis factor receptor (TNFR1) and promotes receptor shedding.

Furthermore, ARTS-1 promoted IL-6Rα shedding, as demonstrated by a direct correlation between increased membrane-associated ARTS-1 protein, increased IL-6Rα shedding, and decreased membrane-associated IL-6Rα in cell lines overexpressing ARTS-1. The absence of basal IL-6Rα shedding from arts-1 knock-out cells identified that ARTS-1 was required for constitutive IL-6Rα shedding. Furthermore, the mechanism of constitutive IL-6Rα shedding requires ARTS-1 catalytic activity. Thus, ARTS-1 promotes the shedding of two cytokine receptor superfamilies, the type I cytokine receptor superfamily (IL-6Rα) and the TNF receptor superfamily (TNFR1). We propose that ARTS-1 is a multifunctional aminopeptidase that may modulate inflammatory events by promoting IL-6Rα and TNFR1 shedding.

IL-6 production occurs in response to infection, trauma, and immunological challenge and may contribute to the pathogenesis of a number of diseases (e.g. autoimmune disorders, multiple myeloma, osteoporosis, Crohn's disease, rheumatoid arthritis, and congestive heart disease) (2Kishimoto T.

In addition to its pro-inflammatory effects, IL-6 has anti-inflammatory functions, such as the suppression of endotoxin-mediated neutrophil recruitment, induction of interleukin-1 receptor antagonist expression, and stimulation of shedding of the 55-kDa, type I tumor necrosis factor receptor (TNFR1, CD120a) as a soluble TNF-binding protein (6Tilg H.

The IL-6 receptor complex comprises two distinct membrane-bound glycoproteins, the 80-kDa IL-6 α-receptor subunit (IL-6Rα, CD 126) and the 130-kDa signal transducing subunit (gp130) (9Jones S.A. Novick D. Horiuchi S. Yamamoto N. Szalai A.J. Fuller G.M. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 189: 599-604Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Following binding of IL-6 to IL-6Rα, two IL-6/IL-6Rα molecules form a complex with the homodimeric gp130, which mediates signaling via the activation of Janus kinases (JAK1, JAK2, and TYK2) that are constitutively associated with the gp130 intracytoplasmic tail (10Lutticken C.

Subsequent phosphorylation of members of the signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) family, such as STAT1 and STAT3, as well as the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway, mediate activation of IL-6-responsive genes (13Gerhartz C.

Generation of soluble IL-6 receptors (sIL-6Rα) represents an important mechanism by which IL-6 signaling can be amplified. Soluble IL-6 receptors bind IL-6 with an affinity similar to that of the membrane IL-6 receptor, thereby prolonging the half-life of IL-6 (17Peters M. Jacobs S. Ehlers M. Vollmer P. Mullberg J. Wolf E. Brem G. Meyer zum Buschenfelde K.H. Rose-John S. J. Exp. Med. 1996; : 1399-1406Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). Furthermore, binding of the sIL-6Rα·IL-6 complex to membrane-bound gp130 confers IL-6 signaling capability to cells that do not express IL-6Rα. Because of the ubiquitous expression of gp130, trans-signaling via the generation of sIL-6Rα·IL-6 complexes can extend the repertoire of IL-6-responsive cell types (9Jones S.A. Novick D. Horiuchi S. Yamamoto N. Szalai A.J. Fuller G.M. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 189: 599-604Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar, 18Marin V. Montero-Julian F. Gres S. Bongrand P. Farnarier C. Kaplanski G. Eur. J. Immunol. 2002; 32: 2965-2970Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). For example, trans-signaling via sIL-6Rα·IL-6 complexes has been identified as an important regulator of CXC and CC chemokine expression that contributes to the termination of neutrophil recruitment and the concurrent influx of mononuclear cells during acute inflammation secondary to bacterial infection (7Hurst S.

Immunity. 2001; 14: 705-714Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (644) Google Scholar). It is important to note, however, that the trans-signaling function of the sIL-6Rα·IL-6 complex can be abrogated by the soluble form of gp130 (sgp130), which competes with membrane gp130 for sIL-6R·IL-6 complex binding (5Kallen K.

Immunol. 1998; 161: 6347-6355PubMed Google Scholar). Further, sIL-6Rα can potentiate the antagonistic potential of sgp130. Therefore, soluble IL-6 receptors have the potential to serve either as IL-6 signaling agonists or, alternatively, as IL-6 signaling antagonists. Soluble IL-6 receptors can be generated by two distinct pathways: proteolytic cleavage that sheds the membrane-bound IL-6Rα ectodomain from the cell surface or differential mRNA splicing that results in the generation of an IL-6Rα that lacks the transmembrane domain (20Jones S.A.

Proteolytic cleavage of IL-6Rα, which occurs between Gln-357 and Asp-358, is strongly promoted by phorbol ester (22Mullberg J. Oberthur W. Lottspeich F. Mehl E. Dittrich E. Graeve L. Heinrich P.C.

Experiments utilizing hydroxamic acid-based metalloprotease inhibitors have suggested that TACE (TNF-α-converting enzyme or ADAM 17), a member of the metalloprotease-disintegrin (ADAM) family of zinc metalloproteases, possesses IL-6Rα sheddase activity (20Jones S.A.

Further evidence supporting TACE-mediated IL-6Rα shedding is the strong reduction in phorbol ester-induced IL-6Rα shedding in TACE-deficient murine fibroblasts that can be rescued by reconstitution of TACE expression (25Althoff K. Reddy P. Voltz N. Rose-John S. Mullberg J. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 2624-2631Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). However, the existence of additional IL-6Rα sheddases has been suggested by a basal hydroxamate-sensitive IL-6Rα shedding from TACE-deficient cells, as well as by IL-6Rα shedding that is resistant to the hydroxamic acid-based metalloprotease inhibitor, TAPI (9Jones S.A.

The aminopeptidase regulator of TNFR1 shedding (ARTS-1) has recently been identified as a type II integral membrane protein that binds to the TNFR1 extracellular domain and promotes TNFR1 shedding (29Cui X. Hawari F. Alsaaty S. Lawrence M. Combs C.A. Geng W. Rouhani F. Miskinis D. Levine S.J. J. Clin. Invest. 2002; 110: 515-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Because hydroxamic acid-based metalloprotease inhibitors prevent shedding of both TNFR1 and IL-6Rα, we hypothesized that ARTS-1 might also regulate IL-6Rα shedding. By utilizing an arts-1 knock-out cell line (arts-1 (–/–)), we demonstrate that ARTS-1 is required for constitutive IL-6Rα shedding. Transfection of arts-1 (–/–) cell lines with plasmids containing full-length ARTS-1 restored IL-6Rα shedding, whereas transfection with ARTS-1 catalytic site mutants did not. These data indicate that the mechanism of constitutive IL-6Rα shedding requires ARTS-1 catalytic activity. Furthermore, ARTS-1 directly binds to a 55-kDa IL-6Rα, a size consistent with soluble IL-6Rα generated by ectodomain cleavage of the membrane-bound receptor. Thus, ARTS-1 may modulate inflammatory events by promoting the shedding of two cytokine receptor superfamilies, the type I cytokine receptor superfamily (IL-6Rα) and the TNF receptor superfamily (TNFR1). ARTS-1/IL-6Rα Co-immunoprecipitation and Immunoblotting—The NCI-H292 human pulmonary mucoepidermoid carcinoma cell line was purchased from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA) and grown in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum under 5% CO2 at 37 °C. Immunoprecipitation experiments were performed as described previously (29Cui X. Hawari F. Alsaaty S. Lawrence M. Combs C.A. Geng W. Rouhani F. Miskinis D. Levine S.J. J. Clin. Invest. 2002; 110: 515-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were harvested for membrane isolation by scraping and were disrupted by sonicating twice (for 10 s each) in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.2, 120 mm NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100, and Complete™ protease inhibitor (Roche Applied Science)), followed by centrifugation at 1,000 × g for 5 min to remove nuclei and cellular debris. Post-nuclear supernatants were centrifuged at 100,000 × g for1hto recover membrane pellets that were suspended by sonicating three times (for 2 s each) in lysis buffer. Protein concentrations were determined utilizing the BCA protein determination kit (Pierce). For immunoprecipitation, samples of membrane proteins (200 μg) were incubated overnight, 4 °C, with 20 μg of murine monoclonal anti-human IL-6Rα antibody against the IL-6Rα extracellular domain (R & D Systems) or 1 μl of rabbit anti-human ARTS-1 immune or pre-immune serum, followed by addition of 200 μl of immobilized protein A/G beads (Pierce) for 2 h at room temperature. The ARTS-1 antibody recognizes a 17-amino acid epitope (RGRNVHMKQE-HYMKGSD) located in exon 11 (29Cui X. Hawari F. Alsaaty S. Lawrence M. Combs C.A. Geng W. Rouhani F. Miskinis D. Levine S.J. J. Clin. Invest. 2002; 110: 515-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). After the beads were washed 8 times, bound proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE, electroblotted onto nitrocellulose membranes, and incubated overnight (4 °C) with ARTS-1 immune or pre-immune serum diluted 1:20,000 or the murine anti-IL-6Rα monoclonal antibody, 2 μg/ml. Detection was by chemiluminescence using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies. For immunoblotting, samples of membrane proteins (20–40 μg) were separated via SDS-PAGE, electroblotted onto nitrocellulose membranes, and incubated overnight (4 °C) with either ARTS-1 immune serum, diluted 1:20,000, rabbit polyclonal anti-human IL-6Rα (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), 1 μg/ml, or goat anti-MUC1 polyclonal antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), 1 μg/ml. Detection was by chemiluminescence using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies. ARTS-1 Cell Lines—Stably transfected NCI-H292 cell lines that expressed either full-length human ARTS-1 or antisense ARTS-1 (bases 61–213) were utilized, as described previously (29Cui X. Hawari F. Alsaaty S. Lawrence M. Combs C.A. Geng W. Rouhani F. Miskinis D. Levine S.J. J. Clin. Invest. 2002; 110: 515-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). To quantify membrane-associated IL-6Rα, membrane fractions were prepared, as described above, and assays were performed on 300 μg of membrane proteins utilizing a sandwich ELISA with a sensitivity of 7.8 pg/ml (R & D Systems). sIL-6Rα in cell culture supernatants was assayed by ELISA. Immunoblotting was performed on culture supernatants that were concentrated 30-fold utilizing a Centriprep filter with a 10-kDa exclusion (Amicon). Phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) was purchased from Sigma. TAPI-0, TAPI-1, and TAPI-2 were purchased from Peptides International. Statistical analysis was performed using a Student's t test with a Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons. A p value of less than 0.05 was considered significant. Construction of an arts-1 Knock-out NCI-H292 Cell Line—The arts-1 targeting vector was generated by assembling sequences flanking arts-1 exons 5 and 6 as the upstream and downstream arms of the PKO scrambler NTKV 1902 vector (Stratagene) (30Hattori A. Matsumoto K. Mizutani S. Tsujimoto M. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 2001; 130: 235-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The following PCR primer pairs, which span exons 3 and 4, were utilized to generate the up-stream arm: primer A (5′-CCC-AAG-CTT-GGG-TTC-TCC-CTC-TGT-TAG-TCG-C-3′) and primer B (5′-CCA-TCG-ATG-GTG-AAA-TGA-CAG-TTA-GAC-CCT-C-3′). Primer A contains a HindIII restriction site, whereas primer B contains a ClaI restriction site. The downstream arm, which spans exons 7 and 8, was generated utilizing the following primers: primer C (5′-CGG-GAT-CCC-GAT-TGT-TTC-TCC-AAA-GCA-TTC-GT-3′), which contains a BamHI restriction site, and primer D (5′-TCC-CCC-GGG-GGA-CAT-CAT-CTG-CCA-ACT-CCC-TTT-G-3′), which contains a SmaI restriction site. Genomic DNA isolated from NCI-H292 cells was utilized as a template for PCR amplification of the 7468-bp upstream segments and the 2783-bp downstream segments utilizing Pfu turbo DNA polymerase (Stratagene). The PCR products were digested with the appropriate endonucleases to generate the 3841-bp upstream arm, based upon the presence of an internal HindIII restriction site, and the 2783 downstream arm. The cDNA segments were gel-purified and ligated into the polylinker region of the PKO scrambler NTKV 1902 vector, which contains both positive (neomycin phosphotransferase) and negative (thymidine kinase) selection markers. The neomycin phosphotransferase gene, in the antisense orientation, is driven by a phosphoglycerate kinase promoter, whereas the thymidine kinase gene, in the sense orientation, is driven by a polyoma enhancer/herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase (MC1) promoter. Sequences of the upstream and downstream arms were confirmed by DNA sequencing. NCI-H292 cell lines were transfected with the arts-1 targeting vector using FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science) and maintained under selective pressure by addition of 20 mg/ml geneticin (Invitrogen) and 400 μm ganciclovir (Sigma) to medium followed by pH adjustment with NaHCO3. Transfected cells were cloned by limiting dilution, and clones containing homozygous deletions generated by homologous recombination were characterized by PCR and RT-PCR analysis of genomic DNA and mRNA utilizing the following primer pairs: Neo 1 sense, 5′-TTC-CTT-CCC-TGG-CAT-CTA-CCT-C-3′, and arts-1 intron 8/9 antisense, 5′-TTC-CCG-CTT-CAG-TGA-CAA-CG-3′; Neo 2 sense, 5′-TCG-CCT-TCT-ATC-GCC-TTC-TTG-3′, and arts-1 intron 10/11 antisense, 5′-AAA-AGA-ATG-TGC-TTG-GGG-GAA-C-3′; arts-1 exon 5/6 sense, 5′-CAG-TCA-TTG-TGA-TGC-CAA-G-3′, and arts-1 exon 5/6 antisense, 5′-GCT-GTG-CCA-GAC-AAG-ATA-AAT-C-3′; arts-1 exon 15/17 sense, 5′-CTA-CTG-GGT-TCC-TGC-CAA-TGA-G-3′, and arts-1 exon 15/17 antisense, 5′-TCA-ACT-ACT-ACT-CCT-CGC-CTG-TGT-G-3′; arts-1 exon 2/19 sense, 5′-CAT-GGT-GTC-AGA-GCA-CT-3′, and arts-1 exon 2/19 antisense, 5′-CAT-ACG-TTC-AAG-CTT-TTC-3′; G3PDH sense, 5′-TGA-AGG-TCG-GAG-TCA-ACG-GAT-TTG-GT-3′, and G3PDH antisense, 5′-CAT-GTG-GGC-CAT-GAG-GTC-CAC-CAC-3′. RT-PCR of IL-6 mRNA was performed utilizing previously described primer pairs that span the IL-6Rα transmembrane domain to generate a 398-bp product (24Horiuchi S. Koyanagi Y. Zhou Y. Miyamoto H. Tanaka Y. Waki M. Matsumoto A. Yamamoto M. Yamamoto N. Eur. J. Immunol. 1994; 24: 1945-1948Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). The glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (G3PDH) primers were purchased from Clontech. arts-1 (–/–) cell lines were reconstituted by transient transfection with plasmids encoding either full-length ARTS-1 or ARTS-1 catalytic site mutants (H353P, H357V, and H353P/E354V), utilizing Gene Porter II and Booster (Gene Therapy Systems), as described previously (29Cui X. Hawari F. Alsaaty S. Lawrence M. Combs C.A. Geng W. Rouhani F. Miskinis D. Levine S.J. J. Clin. Invest. 2002; 110: 515-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). IL-6Rα Ectodomain Cleavage Assay—A model system was utilized to assess whether ARTS-1 catalyzes the proteolytic cleavage of the IL-6Rα ectodomain. A recombinant glutathione S-transferase-ARTS-1 (GST-ARTS-1) fusion protein was synthesized in BL21 Escherichia coli transfected with a pGEX-6P-1 plasmid encoding the ARTS-1 extracellular domain and purified using glutathione-Sepharose 4B (Amersham Biosciences) (29Cui X. Hawari F. Alsaaty S. Lawrence M. Combs C.A. Geng W. Rouhani F. Miskinis D. Levine S.J. J. Clin. Invest. 2002; 110: 515-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). The GST-ARTS-1 was recovered from the insoluble fraction by denaturation with 6 m urea in phosphate-buffered saline and refolded by serial dialysis against phosphate-buffered saline containing decreasing urea concentrations. The GST-ARTS-1 fusion protein was demonstrated to be catalytically active and possess aminopeptidase activity against leucine, methionine, alanine, and phenylalanine p-nitroanilide model substrates. A 22-amino acid model peptide substrate (RDSANATSLPVQDSSSVPLPTF) containing the IL-6Rα cleavage site was synthesized by Sigma-Genosys. Peptides corresponding to the 12-amino acid N-terminal cleavage product (RDSANATSLPVQ) and the 10-amino acid C-terminal cleavage product (DSSSVPLPTF) were also synthesized to serve as standards. The peptide substrate (2.5 μg/ml) was incubated with GST-ARTS-1 (200 ng/ml) for 2 h at 37 °C before transfer of 50 μl of reaction mixture to a Vydac (Hesperia, CA) C18 column (The Nest Group, Southborough, MA) equilibrated with solution A (0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, HPLC grade water). The mixture was then separated by gradient elution with solution B (0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, acetonitrile) at a flow rate of 0.8 ml/min: 100% solution A, 0–2 min, linear gradient 0–67.5% of solution B, 2–20 min. The absorbance of the eluate was recorded at 214 nm. Membrane-associated ARTS-1 Binds to IL-6Rα—Immunoprecipitation experiments were performed to assess whether an endogenous protein-protein interaction exists between ARTS-1 and IL-6Rα in NCI-H292 cells. As shown in Fig. 1A, immunoprecipitation of membrane fractions with an anti-IL-6Rα monoclonal antibody pulled down the 100-kDa ARTS-1 protein. In the reciprocal experiment (Fig. 1B), immunoprecipitation with ARTS-1 antiserum pulled down a 55-kDa IL-6Rα species, which is consistent with the soluble form of IL-6Rα generated by proteolytic cleavage of the IL-6Rα extracellular domain. These experiments demonstrate that the 100-kDa membrane-associated ARTS-1 species binds the 55-kDa soluble form of IL-6Rα. Because both IL-6Rα and TNFR1 can be co-immunoprecipitated with ARTS-1, we next assessed whether the binding of IL-6Rα and TNFR1 to ARTS-1 is mutually exclusive. When immunoblots demonstrating that an anti-IL-6Rα antibody coimmunoprecipitates ARTS-1 were stripped and re-probed with an anti-TNFR1 antibody, no TNFR1 was detected. Similarly, immunoblots demonstrating that an anti-TNFR1 antibody coimmunoprecipitates ARTS-1 were stripped and re-probed with an anti-IL-6Rα antibody, no IL-6Rα was detected (data not shown). When immunoblots demonstrating that an anti-ARTS-1 antibody co-immunoprecipitates IL-6Rα were stripped and reprobed with an anti-TNFR1 antibody, TNFR1 was detected. These experiments are consistent with the conclusion that the bindings of IL-6Rα and TNFR1 to ARTS-1 are mutually exclusive. ARTS-1 Promotes IL-6Rα Shedding—To determine whether ARTS-1 increases IL-6Rα shedding, experiments were performed utilizing cell lines stably transfected with ARTS-1 cDNA in either the sense or antisense orientation (29Cui X. Hawari F. Alsaaty S. Lawrence M. Combs C.A. Geng W. Rouhani F. Miskinis D. Levine S.J. J. Clin. Invest. 2002; 110: 515-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). The ARTS-1 cell lines express full-length ARTS-1 coding sequence, whereas the antisense cell lines express ARTS-1 bases 61–213, which includes the putative translation start site and the intracellular and transmembrane domains. The effect of ARTS-1 protein expression on IL-6Rα ectodomain shedding into culture supernatants was assessed by ELISA. As shown in Fig. 2A, the amount of sIL-6Rα present in culture supernatants from cell lines overexpressing ARTS-1 was significantly greater than that of mock-transfected cells, whereas supernatants from cell lines transfected with antisense ARTS-1 had significantly less sIL-6Rα than did mock-transfected cells. The quantity of soluble 55-kDa IL-6Rα in culture supernatants was also analyzed by immunoblotting. As shown in Fig. 2B, the quantity of 55-kDa IL-6Rα in culture supernatants from ARTS-1 cell lines was significantly greater than that from wild type NCI-H292 cells or mock-transfected cells. Reciprocally, the quantity of IL-6Rα protein in supernatants from ARTS-1 antisense cell lines was markedly less. These experiments demonstrate that changes in ARTS-1 protein levels correlated directly with changes in soluble IL-6Rα protein. Experiments were also performed to assess whether ARTS-1 protein expression correlated with levels of membrane-associated IL-6Rα. As shown in Fig. 2C, the quantity of membrane-associated IL-6Rα, as determined by ELISA, was significantly greater in the ARTS-1 antisense cell lines than in mock-transfected cell lines, whereas the quantity of membrane-associated IL-6Rα in the ARTS-1 cell lines was below the limit of detection. Similarly, as shown in Fig. 2D, the quantity of full-length 80-kDa IL-6Rα, as determined by immunoblotting, was significantly greater in the ARTS-1 antisense cell lines than in mock-transfected cell lines, whereas the quantity of membrane-associated full-length 80-kDa IL-6Rα in the ARTS-1 cell lines was significantly reduced. These experiments demonstrate that ARTS-1 protein expression is inversely correlated with levels of membrane-associated IL-6Rα, consistent with the ability of ARTS-1 to promote IL-6Rα shedding. Further, in contrast to the ARTS-1 pull-down experiments, no 55-kDa, cleaved IL-6Rα was identified in crude membrane fractions. This suggests that IL-6Rα ectodomain cleavage and binding to ARTS-1 require co-localization within cellular membranes, as occurs during immunoprecipitation. NCI-H292 Cells Selectively Express the Membrane-Bound IL-6 Receptor—RT-PCR experiments were performed to characterize the expression of IL-6Rα isoforms by NCI-H292 cells. Primers were utilized that spanned the IL-6Rα transmembrane domain and could amplify mRNAs for both the membrane-bound IL-6Rα species, as demonstrated by a 398-bp PCR product, and the alternatively spliced, soluble IL-6Rα species, as demonstrated by a 304-bp product (24Horiuchi S.

As shown in bottom right panel of Fig. 3B, RT-PCR amplification of NCI-H292 cell mRNA revealed a single 398-bp PCR product that is consistent with expression of the membrane-bound IL-6Rα. I"
https://openalex.org/W2044034296,"Retinoschisin is a 24-kDa discoidin domain-containing protein that is secreted from photoreceptor and bipolar cells as a large disulfide-linked multisubunit complex. It functions as a cell adhesion protein to maintain the cellular organization and synaptic structure of the retina. Over 125 different mutations in the RS1 gene are associated with X-linked juvenile retinoschisis, the most common form of early onset macular degeneration in males. To identify molecular determinants important for retinoschisin structure and function and elucidate molecular and cellular mechanisms responsible for X-linked juvenile retinoschisis, we have analyzed the expression, protein folding, disulfide-linked subunit assembly, intracellular localization, and secretion of wild-type retinoschisin, 15 Cys-to-Ser variants and 12 disease-linked mutants. Our studies, together with molecular modeling of the discoidin domain, identify Cys residues involved in intramolecular and intermolecular disulfide bonds essential for protein folding and subunit assembly. We show that misfolding of the discoidin domain, defective disulfide-linked subunit assembly, and inability of retinoschisin to insert into the endoplasmic reticulum membrane as part of the protein secretion process are three primary mechanisms responsible for the loss in the function of retinoschisin as a cell adhesion protein and the pathogenesis of X-linked juvenile retinoschisis."
https://openalex.org/W2036300443,"Store-operated calcium entry (SOCE) is a fundamental mechanism of calcium signaling. The mechanisms linking store depletion to SOCE remain controversial, hypothetically involving both diffusible messengers and conformational coupling of stores to channels. Sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) is a bioactive sphingolipid that can signal via cell surface G-protein-coupled receptors, but S1P can also act as a second messenger, mobilizing calcium directly via unknown mechanisms. We show here that S1P opens calcium entry channels in human neutrophils (PMNs) and HL60 cells without prior store depletion, independent of G-proteins and of phospholipase C. S1P-mediated entry has the typical divalent cation permeability profile and inhibitor profile of SOCE in PMNs, is fully inhibited by 1 μm Gd3+, and is independent of [Ca2+]i. Depletion of PMN calcium stores by thapsigargin induces S1P synthesis. Inhibition of S1P synthesis by dimethylsphingosine blocks thapsigargin-, ionomycin-, and platelet-activating factor-mediated SOCE despite normal store depletion.

The mechanisms governing SOCE are controversial but have centered on two main hypotheses (1Putney Jr., J.W. Broad L.M. Braun F.J. Lievremont J.P. Bird G.S. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 2223-2229Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In one model, emptying of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) calcium stores leads to the release of small diffusible messenger molecules that act on channels to increase Ca2+ entry (2Putney Jr., J.W. Cell Calcium. 1990; 11: 611-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (1261) Google Scholar). Randriamampita and Tsien (3Randriamampita C. Tsien R.Y. Nature. 1993; 364: 809-814Crossref PubMed Scopus (790) Google Scholar) found strong suggestions of such a messenger molecule in extracts from Jurkat T-cells. They termed this molecule “calcium influx factor” (CIF). Other hypotheses suggest that store depletion leads to calcium channel activation via direct physical interactions between cell membranes and intracellular structures. The “exocytosis model” (4Fasolato C. Hoth M. Penner R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20737-20740Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 5Yao Y. Ferrer-Montiel A.V. Montal M. Tsien R.Y. Cell. 1999; 98: 475-485Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar) of physical interactions suggests that vesicles bearing calcium channels fuse with the cell membrane after store depletion. The “conformational coupling” model suggests that ER calcium store depletion can lead to direct physical interactions between ER proteins such as the IP3 receptor and cell membrane calcium channels such as TRPC3 (6Kiselyov K.

FEBS Lett. 1990; 263: 5-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (579) Google Scholar). No specific molecular mechanisms have been proposed however, that might initiate such physical interactions. Moreover, data has continued to accumulate supporting the existence of an unidentified, low molecular weight CIF (8Csutora P. Su Z. Kim H.Y. Bugrim A. Cunningham K.W. Nuccitelli R. Keizer J.E.

Sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) is a universally bioactive, small (M r 380) sphingolipid metabolite. S1P is derived from the metabolism of sphingolipids and, most notably, from the actions of sphingosine kinase (10Liu H. Sugiura M. Nava V.E. Edsall L.C. Kono K. Poulton S. Milstien S. Kohama T.

J. Cell Biol. 1991; 114: 155-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (564) Google Scholar) showed that S1P induces proliferation in Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts. Since that time, the actions of S1P have been studied in detail, and it has been found to be an important extracellular messenger molecule affecting cell growth, differentiation, adhesion, motility, and survival in many organisms and cell types (13Olivera A.

Commun. 2001; 8: 125-138Crossref Scopus (11) Google Scholar). The calcium-mobilizing effects of S1P are often mediated through G-protein coupled receptors (GPCR), and S1P is the natural ligand for at least five cell-surface GPCRs now known as S1PR1–5 (previously Edg1, -5, -3, -6, and -8) (15Goetzl E.J. An S. FASEB J. 1998; 12: 1589-1598Crossref PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar, 16Spiegel S. Milstien S. Biochim. Biophys.

Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1582: 94-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). S1P is also known to enter cells directly, however (19Le Stunff H. Galve-Roperh I. Peterson C. Milstien S. Spiegel S. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 158: 1039-1049Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 20Edsall L.C. Pirianov G.G. Spiegel S. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 6952-6960Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and in some systems S1P can regulate calcium homeostasis by acting as a second messenger (17Pyne S. Pyne N.J. Biochem. J. 2000; 349: 385-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (661) Google Scholar, 21Van Brocklyn J.R. Lee M.J. Menzeleev R. Olivera A. Edsall L. Cuvillier O. Thomas D.M. Coopman P.J. Thangada S. Liu C.H. Hla T. Spiegel S. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 229-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar). The mechanisms by which S1P acts in this intracellular role have not yet been identified, although direct effects on ER calcium stores have been suggested (22MacKinnon A.C. Buckley A. Chilvers E.R. Rossi A.G. Haslett C. Sethi T. J. Immunol. 2002; 169: 6394-6400Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). In yeast, however, intracellular S1P accumulation clearly mediates its biologic effects via calcium entry into the cell (23Birchwood C.J. Saba J.D. Dickson R.C. Cunningham K.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 11712-11718Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMN) are central effectors of the innate immune response to inflammation in humans. Calcium entry into the PMN typically occurs through store-operated mechanisms, and we have noted dysfunctional PMNs store-operated calcium entry (SOCE) after injury (24Hauser C.J. Fekete Z. Adams J.M. Garced M. Livingston D.H. Deitch E.A. J. Leukocyte Biol. 2001; 69: 63-68PubMed Google Scholar). Human PMN have been found to mobilize Ca2+ in response to extracellular stimuli via the activation of SphK (14Aas V. Algeroy S. Sand K.L. Iversen J.G. Cell Adhes. Commun. 2001; 8: 125-138Crossref Scopus (11) Google Scholar), but yet it has also been shown that neutrophil-like HL-60 cells show a complete absence of specific S1P binding (21Van Brocklyn J.R. Lee M.J. Menzeleev R. Olivera A. Edsall L. Cuvillier O. Thomas D.M. Coopman P.J. Thangada S. Liu C.H. Hla T. Spiegel S. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 229-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar), suggesting an absence of functional S1PR. We therefore hypothesized that S1P might mobilize PMN calcium by acting as a second messenger to initiate SOCE. Sphingosine 1-Phosphate—S1P was purchased from Sigma (St. Louis, MO). This preparation of S1P is formulated to be soluble in methanol, which is the optimal vehicle for S1P (25Van Veldhoven P.P. Foglesong R.J. Bell R.M. J. Lipid Res. 1989; 30: 611-616Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A 5 mm stock solution was prepared according to the manufacturer's recommendations. The concentration (1–4 μl/ml) of methanol vehicle used has no effect calcium release or entry. Binding of S1P to plasma proteins has been reported to attenuate its biologic effects (26Murata N. Sato K. Kon J. Tomura H. Yanagita M. Kuwabara A. Ui M. Okajima F. Biochem. J. 2000; 352: 809-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar). We confirmed this in preliminary studies of S1P calcium mobilization in PMN. Therefore, we felt that BSA-free environments were optimal for evaluating the biologic effects of S1P, and avoided the use of BSA in S1P preparation. Other Materials—Sphingosine, pertussis toxin, and other general chemicals were also purchased from Sigma. d-erythro-N,N-Dimethylsphingosine (DMS) was purchased from Biomol Research Laboratories Inc. (Plymouth Meeting, PA). d-erythro-[3H]Sphingosine (1.85 MBq) was purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences (Boston, MA). Thapsigargin and Fura-2AM were purchased from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). PAF, fMLP, ionomycin, and U73122 were purchased from Calbiochem (La Jolla, CA). Neutrophil Preparations—Studies were performed in compliance with the Institutional Review Board of the University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey (UMDNJ)-New Jersey Medical School. Informed consent was obtained for blood withdrawn from healthy human volunteers. A detailed description of our techniques for PMN isolation is available elsewhere (25Van Veldhoven P.P. Foglesong R.J. Bell R.M. J. Lipid Res. 1989; 30: 611-616Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, neutrophils were isolated from heparinized whole blood using a one-step centrifugation procedure. The neutrophil layer was collected, osmolarity was restored, and cells were washed and suspended in HEPES buffer. The number and purity of PMN were checked by flow cytometry. Cells were loaded with 1 μm Fura-2AM and kept on ice until for study. Aliquots of 2 × 106 cells were re-warmed just prior to each experiment. HL-60 Cell Preparations—HL60-G cells, a subclone of the human promyeloblastic leukemia HL60 cell line, were the kind gift of Dr. George Studzinski (UMDNJ, Newark, NJ). Cells were cultured at 37 °C in RPMI 1640 with l-glutamine (Invitrogen) supplemented with 20% heat-inactivated, fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen). 1.3% Me2SO was added for 2–5 days to differentiate them into PMN-like cells. Differentiation was assured by assessment of CD11b using flow cytometry (27Gallagher R. Collins S. Trujillo J. McCredie K. Ahearn M. Tsai S. Metzgar R. Aulakh G. Ting R. Ruscetti F. Gallo R. Blood. 1979; 54: 713-733Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 28Studzinski G.P. Reddy K.B. Hill H.Z. Bhandal A.K. Cancer Res. 1991; 51: 3451-3455PubMed Google Scholar). Divalent Cation Measurements by Spectrofluorometry—Intracellular calcium ([Ca2+]i) was monitored by Fura fluorescence at 505 nm, using 340/380-nm dual wavelength excitation at 37 °C with constant stirring. Calibration was performed after each experiment using digitonin (R max) and EGTA (R min). [Ca2+]i was calculated from the 340/380-nm fluorescence ratio as per the methods of Grynkiewicz et al. (29Grynkiewicz G. Poenie M. Tsien R.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3440-3450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). More detailed descriptions of our techniques are available elsewhere (30Itagaki K. Kannan K.B. Livingston D.H. Deitch E.A. Fekete Z. Hauser C.J. J. Immunol. 2002; 168: 4063-4069Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Measurement of Total PMN S1P Production by Thin Layer Chromatography (TLC)—PMN isolated as above (2 × 106 in 100 μl for each reaction) were incubated in Hanks' balanced salt solution buffer with 1 mm calcium. Aliquots were incubated with DMS or vehicle as indicated for 10 min prior to reactions. At T = 0, 100 μl of a mixture containing [3H]sphingosine (PerkinElmer Life Sciences, 70,000 cpm/reaction) with or without 1 μm TG (final concentration, 500 nm) was added to warmed PMN to begin the reaction. Aliquots were allowed to incubate at 37 °C for 0, 2, 5, and 10 min. The reactions were stopped by the addition of 1 ml of ice-cold methanol:chloroform (2:1). The samples were then vortexed for 10 s and spun for 10 min at 2000 × g. Supernatants were collected, and a second 100-μl mixture of methanol:chloroform (2:1) was applied, vortexed, and spun as before. The combined supernatants were dried, resuspended in 60 μl of methanol, and applied to Silica Gel 60 TLC plates. Unlabeled sphingosine and sphingosine 1-phosphate were applied to control lanes to identify [3H]sphingosine and [3H]sphingosine 1-phosphate, respectively. Lipids were separated by TLC using a 1-butanol/acetic acid/water (3:1:1) mixture. Standard control lipids were visualized using ninhydrin (for S1P and SP) and molybdenum blue (for S1P). The radioactivity of the corresponding areas of the experimental lanes was measured by liquid scintillation counting. The mean ± S.E. of three observations at each time point is shown. More detailed methods can be found elsewhere (31Meyer zu Heringdorf D. Lass H. Kuchar I. Alemany R. Guo Y. Schmidt M. Jakobs K.H. FEBS Lett. 1999; 461: 217-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). S1P Induces Calcium Influx Directly—S1P was applied to human PMN in the absence of external calcium (0.3 mm EGTA added) in order to study calcium store release and influx (Fig. 1). After equilibration, cells were treated with S1P or vehicle (methanol). PMN show no store release transient at all in response to S1P. In contrast, dose-dependent calcium influx is seen on re-addition of external 1 mm Ca2+. Calcium influx is immediate under these conditions, rises to a typical plateau, and subsequently decays. In other experiments no store release transient was seen in Ca2+-free media out to 900 s, although brisk store release responses to the GPCR agonists formyl-Met-Leu-Phe (fMLP) and platelet-activating factor (PAF) continued to be present during this time (data not shown). S1P Induction of Calcium Influx Is Independent of ER Store Depletion—Although no store release transient was seen in response to S1P in the experiments presented in Fig. 1, we evaluated the possibility that undetected store release might have occurred. Fura-loaded PMN samples in calcium-free media were treated with 10 μm S1P or methanol vehicle. The cells were stimulated 30 s later with fMLP to assess the status of IP3-releasable ER calcium stores (Fig. 2). fMLP-induced store release was morphologically identical with and without prior S1P, and no statistically significant evidence of S1P-initiated store depletion could be found at this time point. Moreover, the degree of SOCE seen (on Ca2+ re-addition at t = 300, Fig. 2) was clearly a reflection of the presence of S1P rather than prior store depletion by fMLP. In longer experiments (data not shown), a slow but significant depletion of Ca2+ stores was noted after S1P exposure, but this was limited to a 50% fall in fMLP-releasable stores in comparison to vehicle-treated cells after 15 min. These findings therefore confirm that calcium entry in response to S1P occurs in the absence of significant ER calcium store depletion. S1P Induction of Calcium Influx Is Independent of G-proteins—Prior studies have shown that PMN-like HL60 cells show no specific binding of S1P (21Van Brocklyn J.R. Lee M.J. Menzeleev R. Olivera A. Edsall L. Cuvillier O. Thomas D.M. Coopman P.J. Thangada S. Liu C.H. Hla T. Spiegel S. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 229-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar) and that endogenous S1P production in PMN activates the cells at S1P concentrations far lower than those required for signaling through any of the known S1PR (22MacKinnon A.C. Buckley A. Chilvers E.R. Rossi A.G. Haslett C. Sethi T. J. Immunol. 2002; 169: 6394-6400Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). These findings, plus the lack of GPC store depletion by S1P noted in Fig. 2, make it very unlikely that S1P acts via GPC, cell-surface S1PR in human PMN. Nonetheless, we studied the possibility that S1P-mediated Ca2+ influx might depend on prior store release by cell surface G-protein-coupled S1PR. S1PR1–5 can all signal through the pertussis toxin (PTX)-sensitive Gαi (15Goetzl E.J. An S. FASEB J. 1998; 12: 1589-1598Crossref PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar, 18Siehler S. Manning D.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1582: 94-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Activation of Gαi in the PMN activates phospholipase Cβ (PLC) and causes IP3-dependent release of cell calcium stores within seconds. To further exclude the possibility that PMN responses to S1P were initiated via Gαi-coupled S1PR, we treated PMN with pertussis toxin (PTX, 1 μg/ml, for 3 h at 37 °C) prior to stimulation with S1P. Gαi-coupled calcium store release in the neutrophil is fully inhibited at this PTX dose (32M'Rabet L. Coffer P.J. Wolthuis R.M. Zwartkruis F. Koenderman L. Bos J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21847-21852Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 33Tiffany H.L. Lavigne M.C. Cui Y.H. Wang J.M. Leto T.L. Gao J.L. Murphy P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 23645-23652Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 34He R. Sang H. Ye R.D. Blood. 2003; 101: 1572-1581Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). We found that, in the neutrophil, PTX had no effect upon S1P-induced calcium entry (Fig. 3A), whereas [Ca2+]i responses to fMLP were uniformly abolished (Fig. 3B). Thus PMN calcium influx in response to S1P was independent of PTX-sensitive Gαi-linked S1PR. In addition, however, the S1P2 and SIP3 receptors are also known to bind to Gq/11 (18Siehler S. Manning D.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1582: 94-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). The Gq/11 pathway is not PTX-inhibited, but like Gαi, Gq/11 acts through phospholipase Cβ (PLC) and IP3 to release cell calcium stores (15Goetzl E.J. An S. FASEB J. 1998; 12: 1589-1598Crossref PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar, 18Siehler S. Manning D.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1582: 94-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Thus S1P acting on S1P2 or SIP3 could potentially deplete PMN calcium stores in a PTX-insensitive manner but in a PLC-dependent fashion. We therefore incubated PMN with or without the PLC inhibitor U73122 (20 μm, 5 min at 37 °C) prior to stimulation with S1P. This agent inhibits calcium store depletion by both Gαi and Gq. U73122 had no effect whatsoever on calcium entry in response to S1P (Fig. 4), whereas, again, [Ca2+]i mobilization in response to fMLP was fully blocked. These experiments demonstrate that PMN calcium entry after S1P is independent of Gαi, Gq, the PLC/IP3 pathway, and the depletion of cell Ca2+ stores. S1P-stimulated Ca2+ Entry Is Independent of G-protein Expression in HL60 Cells—To further exclude the possibility that G-protein-coupled, cell-surface S1PR might play a role in PMN Ca2+ entry response to S1P, we evaluated the PMN-like, HL60-G cell line. We found that in their basal (undifferentiated) state, these HL60 cells showed no Ca2+ store release at all in response to fMLP (Fig. 5A, lower trace) or any other typical PMN GPCR agonist (complement fragment 5a, interleukin-8, GRO-α, and leukotriene B4, data not shown). After treatment with 1.3% Me2SO, however, the cells differentiate into a PMN-like (CD11b+, data not shown) phenotype. We found that such “HL60-PMN” cells showed brisk Ca2+ store release responses to fMLP (Fig. 5A, upper trace) as well as all the other PMN agonists noted above. S1P-induced Ca2+ store release remained totally absent despite this generalized increase in the expression of functional GPCR (Fig. 5B). Conversely, S1P induced very similar amounts of calcium entry in HL60-PMN and in HL60 cells (Fig. 5B). These findings support the lack of involvement of GPCR in S1P-mediated PMN calcium mobilization. Ionic Selectivity of SIP-induced Ca2+ Entry—Having determined that PMN calcium entry responses to S1P were independent of store depletion and of GPCR, we compared the known attributes of PMN SOCE with S1P-mediated Ca2+ entry. We have previously reported that total SOCE in human PMN reflects the combined contributions of Ca2+-specific and Sr2+-permeable pathways (30Itagaki K. Kannan K.B. Livingston D.H. Deitch E.A. Fekete Z. Hauser C.J. J. Immunol. 2002; 168: 4063-4069Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). We therefore exposed PMN to 10 μm S1P and serially added 1 mm Sr2+ and 1 mm Ca2+ to the medium (Fig. 6). We detected both Sr2+ influx and Ca2+ influx on serial cation addition. As with TG, ionomycin, fMLP, and PAF stimulation in our prior studies, we found that, after S1P stimulation, additional calcium entry through Ca2+-specific pathways always persisted after Sr2+ entry had reached equilibrium. Thus S1P activates influx through the specific and nonspecific PMN Ca2+ entry pathways and acts upon them in a fashion consistent with that seen previously with traditional agonists eliciting SOCE in the PMN. Sensitivity of SIP-induced Ca2+ Entry to Inorganic Channel Blockers—To ensure that the influx of Ca2+ seen after S1P stimulation was due to entry through channel mechanisms, we studied the effects of the inorganic calcium channel blockers lanthanum (La3+), nickel (Ni2+), zinc (Zn2+), and gadolinium (Gd3+) on S1P-induced influx. PMN were treated with 1 mm La3+, Ni2+, or Zn2+ prior to S1P stimulation (Fig. 7). La3+ and Zn2+ abolished all PMN calcium influx in response to S1P, but Ni2+ was ineffective. This pattern of sensitivity is identical to that of PMN responses to GPC agonists and thapsigargin we described in prior studies (30Itagaki K. Kannan K.B. Livingston D.H. Deitch E.A. Fekete Z. Hauser C.J. J. Immunol. 2002; 168: 4063-4069Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Gadolinium (Gd3+) is another lanthanide inhibitor of calcium entry channels, but at sub-micromolar concentrations Gd3+ is thought to be specific for the store-operated and mechanically sensitive calcium channels that are likely to be composed of TRP proteins (1Putney Jr., J.W.

We therefore performed more detailed studies of PMN calcium entry responses to S1P in the presence of Gd3+ (Fig. 8). S1P-initiated calcium influx was inhibited by nanomolar concentrations of Gd3+ with an EC50 of ∼250 nm and complete inhibition at 1 μm. Again, this pattern was very similar to that we have previously reported for store-operated calcium entry channels in the PMN (30Itagaki K. Kannan K.B. Livingston D.H. Deitch E.A. Fekete Z. Hauser C.J. J. Immunol. 2002; 168: 4063-4069Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Direct Depletion of ER Calcium Stores Activates S1P Synthesis—The stimulation of S1P production from sphingosine by GPC agonists is well known (39Alemany R. Meyer zu Heringdorf D. van Koppen C.J.

Schmidt M. Rauen U. Jakobs K.H. van Koppen C.J. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2830-2837Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar), but if S1P links store depletion to SOCE, then direct store depletion should elicit S1P synthesis. This has not been examined. We therefore studied PMN synthesis of [3H]S1P from [3H]sphingosine after thapsigargin (TG) stimulation using thin-layer chromatography (31Meyer zu Heringdorf D. Lass H. Kuchar I. Alemany R. Guo Y. Schmidt M. Jakobs K.H. FEBS Lett. 1999; 461: 217-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). TG depletes ER stores directly by inhibition of the ER calcium ATPase. We found that TG initiated rapid incorporated of [3H]sphingosine into [3H]S1P (Fig. 9). The kinetics of [3H]S1P formation seen after TG store depletion in PMN were very similar to those seen in HL-60 cells stimulated by formyl peptide (39Alemany R. Meyer zu Heringdorf D. van Koppen C.J. Jakobs K.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3994-3999Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), with rapid synthesis noted over the first 2 min and subsequent formation of a plateau lasting more than 10 min. Moreover, the conversion of [3H]sphingosine to [3H]S1P in response to TG was completely inhibited by the SphK inhibitor DMS (13Olivera A. Kohama T. Edsall L. Nava V. Cuvillier O. Poulton S. Spiegel S. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 545-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (462) Google Scholar, 14Aas V. Algeroy S. Sand K.L. Iversen J.G. Cell Adhes. Commun. 2001; 8: 125-138Crossref Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Inhibition of S1P Synthesis Uncouples Store Depletion from SOCE—A wide variety of external stimuli can cause cells to metabolize sphingosine to S1P via the actions of SphK (reviewed in Olivera and Spiegel (41Olivera A. Spiegel S. Prostaglandins. 2001; 64: 123-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar)). This conversion is inhibited by DMS (13Olivera A. Kohama T. Edsall L. Nava V. Cuvillier O. Poulton S. Spiegel S. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 545-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (462) Google Scholar, 14Aas V. Algeroy S. Sand K.L. Iversen J.G. Cell Adhes. Commun. 2001; 8: 125-138Crossref Scopus (11) Google Scholar). If direct store depletion initiates S1P synthesis and thus SOCE, then inhibition of S1P synthesis by DMS should inhibit SOCE resulting from direct store depletion. We therefore assessed whether SOCE initiated by TG (500 nm) or ionomycin (100 nm) could be inhibited by DMS. Store depletion by TG (Fig. 10A) as well as ionomycin (Fig. 10B) proceeded normally in calcium-free media in the presence of DMS. Upon re-addition of calcium to the medium, however, we saw dose-dependent inhibition of SOCE by DMS with 100% inhibition at about 15 μm. These data clearly demonstrate that blockade of SphK and the resultant loss of cellular S1P synthesis abolishes the link between ER calcium store depletion and calcium entry into the PMN. We also examined this issue in HL60 cells (Fig. 11) and found that TG-initiated Ca2+ store release was unaffected by DMS and completely independent of the state of cell differentiation. Conversely, DMS inhibited TG-initiated SOCE completely. The SOCE response to TG, which, unlike responses to cell-surface agonists, is GPCR-independent, was noted to be markedly increased by differentiation of the cells. DMS-inhibitable SOCE Is [Ca2+]i-independent—TG induces both S1P synthesis and DMS-inhibitable calcium entry. To determine whether such DMS-inhibitable calcium entry truly represents SOCE, it is important to know whether it occurs in a manner that is independent of elevations in [Ca2+]i. We therefore studied the effects of DMS on store depletion-dependent entry of manganese (Mn2+) into 1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid (BAPTA)-loaded PMN (Fig. 12). Under these conditions, ER stores are depleted without elevations of [Ca2+]i, and store-operated divalent cation entry can be assessed as the quenching of Fura by Mn2+ entry (24Hauser C.J. Fekete Z.

However, the mechanism involved in its nuclear translocation is unclear. In this study, by systematic deletion and site-directed mutagenesis we identified Arg-214/215 in the α-helix 2 region of the coiled-coil domain of Stat3 as a novel sequence element essential for its nuclear translocation, stimulated by epidermal growth factor as well as by interleukin-6. Furthermore, we identified Arg-414/417 in the DNA binding domain as also required for the nuclear localization of Stat3. This sequence element corresponds to Lys-410/413 of Stat1, a reported sequence for Stat1 nuclear translocation. On the other hand, Leu-411 of Stat3, corresponding to Leu-407 of Stat1, a necessary residue for Stat1 nuclear transport, is not essential for Stat3 nuclear import. The mutant of Arg-214/215 or Arg-414/417 was shown to be tyrosyl-phosphorylated normally but failed to enter the nucleus in response to epidermal growth factor or interleukin-6. The defect, however, can be rescued by the wild-type Stat3 but cannot be compensated by these two mutants. Mutations on Arg-414/417, but not Arg-214/215, destroy the DNA binding activity of Stat3. Our data for the first time identified a sequence element located in the coiled-coil domain that is involved in the ligand-induced nuclear translocation of Stat3.

This novel sequence together with a conserved sequence element in the DNA binding domain coordinates to mediate the nuclear translocation of Stat3. In eukaryotic cells, certain latent transcription factors are primarily located in the cytoplasm under unstimulated conditions. Upon an extracellular stimulation, however, they are rapidly translocated into the nucleus, where they bind to the regulatory elements of the target genes and regulate their expression. Some of these factors are subsequently exported to the cytoplasm. The nuclear import and export of the transcription factors therefore function as an important biological switch for the control of gene expression and cellular responses. In general, proteins to be imported contain a specific target sequence designated NLS, 1The abbreviations used are: NLS, nuclear localization signal; STATs, signal transducers and activators of transcription; EGF, epidermal growth factor; IL-6, interleukin-6; ND, N-terminal domain; CC, coiled-coil domain; DB, DNA binding domain; LK, linker domain; CT, C-terminal transactivation domain; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay; GFP, green fluorescent protein; LMB, leptomycin B; EPO, erythropoietin; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; SIF, serum-induced factor.1The abbreviations used are: NLS, nuclear localization signal; STATs, signal transducers and activators of transcription; EGF, epidermal growth factor; IL-6, interleukin-6; ND, N-terminal domain; CC, coiled-coil domain; DB, DNA binding domain; LK, linker domain; CT, C-terminal transactivation domain; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay; GFP, green fluorescent protein; LMB, leptomycin B; EPO, erythropoietin; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; SIF, serum-induced factor. a nuclear localization signal, consisting of either a stretch of basic amino acids or two basic stretches separated by a spacer ranging from 10 to 37 amino acids (1Robbins J.

Cell. 1984; 39: 499-509Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1854) Google Scholar). These proteins bind to a cytoplasmic receptor composed of importin α and importin β. Importin α belongs to a divergent family of proteins that serves as adaptors between the substrates and importin β (3Gorlich D. Prehn S. Laskey R.A. Hartmann E.

Importin β docks the NLS-containing protein and the importin α complex at the nuclear pore complex, which is a specialized structure of the nuclear envelope (5Reichelt R. Holzenburg A.

Stat proteins are primarily located in the cytoplasm. Upon cytokine stimulation, Stat proteins are recruited to the cytokine receptors and phosphorylated by the receptor-associated tyrosine kinases, Janus kinases, on a single tyrosine residue at the C termini. Stat proteins form homo- or heterodimers via reciprocal interactions between the SH2 domains and the phosphotyrosine and translocate into the nucleus, where they bind to DNA and regulate transcription of their target genes (10Darnell Jr., J.E.

They are activated by various cytokines and growth factors and play important roles in diverse cellular processes such as the antiviral protection, immune responses, cell growth, and apoptosis by regulating expression of numerous genes (12Darnell Jr., J.E.

Although the nuclear translocation is a key control for the activities, no classical NLS was found in Stat proteins, and mechanisms of their nuclear import were unclear for a long time. Recently, a few reports, mainly focused on Stat1, appeared to address this issue. An arginine/lysine-rich element in the DNA binding domain of Stat1 is reported to be important for the interferon-induced nuclear import of Stat1 and Stat2 (18Meyer T. Begitt A.

In addition, leucine 407 of Stat1, which is also located in the DNA binding domain, has been demonstrated to be required for its nuclear import (20McBride K.M. Banninger G. McDonald C. Reich N.C. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 1754-1763Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Furthermore, importin α5 (NPI-1) was shown to interact with Stat1 homodimer and Stat1/Stat2 heterodimer and to be involved in their nuclear import (20McBride K.M. Banninger G. McDonald C. Reich N.C.

On the other hand, a region (466VVVI469) in Stat5b was reported to be involved in its nuclear translocation stimulated by growth hormone (23Herrington J. Rui L. Luo G. Yu-Lee L.Y. Carter-Su C. J.

In addition to IL-6, Stat3 is also stimulated by growth factors such as EGF (26Zhong Z. Wen Z. Darnell Jr., J.E. Science. 1994; 264: 95-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (1693) Google Scholar, 27Sadowski H.B.

In contrast to Stat1 and Stat2, Stat3 plays a broader role in a variety of biological responses, such as cell growth, transformation, survival, and early embryonic development (28Akira S.

Although the dimerization of Stat3 was reported to be required and sufficient for its nuclear translocation (33Milocco L.H. Haslam J.A. Rosen J. Seidel H.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 2913-2920Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), the sequences and the mechanism of nuclear translocation of Stat3 in response to cytokines and growth factors were largely unknown. During the previous study in identification of domains involving the cellular co-localization of Stat3 and its interacting protein, GRIM-19, we surprisingly observed that the truncation mutant of Stat3 containing the N-terminal domain and the coiled-coil domain was constitutively localized in the nucleus of MCF-7 cells (34Lufei C. Ma J. Huang G. Zhang T. Novotny-Diermayr V. Ong C.T. Cao X. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 1325-1335Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). In this study we attempted to further identify the specific sequence for Stat3 nuclear localization. By systematic deletion and numerous site-directed mutagenesis, we found two sequence clusters located in the coiled-coil domain and the DNA binding domain of Stat3 to be required for EGF-induced nuclear translocation. We also provide evidence showing that Stat proteins may be imported to the nucleus via overlapping and distinct sequence elements.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESConstructions of Expression Plasmids—The murine Stat3 and its deletion mutants, ST3-ND.4H, ST3-DB.LK, ST3-SH2.CT, ST3-ND, and ST3–4H were cloned into pXJ40-FLAG as described previously (35Zhang T.

Deletion mutants ST3-ND.3H1–296, ST3-ND.2H1–260, ST3-ND.1H1–198 were generated by PCR using primers containing the HindIII site at 5′ and the KpnI site at 3′ and the murine Stat3 expression plasmid as a template. The respective PCR product was cloned into pXJ40-FLAG and sequenced. Stat3 and green fluorescent protein (GFP) fusions were constructed by PCR using primers with the HindIII site at 5′ and the KpnI site at 3′ and inserted into pEGFP-N1 (Clontech). ST3-ND.4H-ΔH1 and ST3-ND.4H-ΔH2 were generated by PCR using primers with the HindIII site at 5′ and the KpnI site at 3′ and ST3-ΔH1 and ST3-ΔH2 as templates (35Zhang T. Seow K.T. Ong C.T. Cao X. J.

Point mutations were prepared using primers containing the appropriate mutations and the full-length Stat3 as a template. The long template PCR kit with Pfu DNA polymerase (Promega) was used followed by DpnI digestion and subsequent transformation. The full-length Stat3 and the mutants R214A/R215A and R414A/R417A were cloned into both pXJ40-FLAG and pXJ40-Myc (36Manser E. Loo T.H. Koh C.G. Zhao Z.S. Chen X.Q. Tan L. Tan I. Leung T. Lim L. Mol.

The mutagenesis was confirmed by sequencing on ABI PRISM 3700 DNA Analyzer using BigDye (version 3.0) (Applied Biosystems).Reagents and Antibodies—EGF and IL-6 were purchased from Up-state Biotechnology and R&D Systems, respectively. Leptomycin B (LMB) and anti-FLAG antibody (M2) were purchased from Sigma. Anti-Stat3 (N terminus) was obtained from BD Biosciences. Anti-Stat3 (C terminus) and anti-Myc antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, and anti-phospho-Tyr705 was obtained from Cell Signaling.Cell Culture and DNA Transfection—COS-1 and HepG2 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, and MCF-7 cells were grown in RPMI supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum purchased from Invitrogen. Transient transfections were performed with LipofectAMINE for cell fractionation and LipofectAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen) for the other experiments following the manufacturers' instructions.Immunofluorescence—Cells grown on coverslips were transfected with various expression plasmids. For MCF-7 cells, after transfection for 24 h, cells were fixed with 1% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 30 min at 4 °C and sequentially washed with PBS, PBS containing 100 mm NH4Cl, and then PBS. After permeabilizing with methanol for 5 min, the cells were washed and incubated with FDB (PBS with 1 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 5% normal goat serum, 10% fetal bovine serum, and 2% bovine serum albumin) for 1 h at 4 °C followed by incubation with primary antibodies in FDB for 1 h. After washing 3 times with PBS containing 0.1% Triton X-100, cells were incubated with the appropriate secondary antibodies conjugated with fluorescein isothiocyanate or Cy3for1hat4 °C. Cells were then washed 3 times with PBS containing 0.1% Triton X-100, mounted with FluoroGuard™ antifade reagent (Bio-Rad), and examined using confocal microscope (Bio-Rad MRC 1024). The images were processed with Adobe Photoshop software. A similar procedure was performed for COS-1 cells, except that COS-1 cells were fixed with 3% paraformaldehyde, permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100, and washed with PBS in the absence of Triton X-100.Immunoprecipitation and Immunoblotting—Transfected cells were washed with cold PBS and lysed in radio immunoprecipitation assay buffer. The lysates containing 1 mg of total proteins were subjected to immunoprecipitation/immunoblotting as described previously (37Cao X. Tay A. Guy G.R. Tan Y.H. Mol. Cell.

The precipitates were washed, separated by SDS-PAGE, and transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane followed by immunoblot analysis with the respective antibodies.Cell Fractionation and Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay (EMSA)—The whole cell extracts were prepared from 60-mm dishes. Cells were lysed with buffer E (20 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 5 mm EDTA, 10 mm EGTA, 5 mm NaF, 0.1 μg/ml okadaic acid, 10% glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol) containing 0.4 m KCl, 0.4% Triton X-100, and protease inhibitors including 5 μg/ml leupeptin, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, 5 μg/ml pepstatin A, 1 mm benzamidine, and 50 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The extract was sonicated, clarified by centrifugation, and quantitated by using the Bio-Rad protein assay kit (38Marais R. Wynne J. Treisman R. Cell. 1993; 73: 381-393Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1104) Google Scholar). EMSAs were performed as described previously (37Cao X. Tay A. Guy G.R. Tan Y.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1595-1603Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar). Cytoplasmic and nuclear extracts were prepared as follows. Transfected COS-1 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 0.5% fetal bovine serum for 24 h before stimulation with 100 ng/ml EGF for 15 min. Cells were rinsed with PBS before lysis in buffer A (10 mm HEPES-KOH (pH 7.9), 1.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm KCl, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol). Cell lysates were incubated on ice for 10 min followed by 10 s of vortexing and 10 s of centrifugation at high speed in a microcentrifuge. The supernatant was collected as cytoplasmic extract, and the pellet was washed twice with buffer A and dissolved in buffer B (20 mm HEPES-KOH, 25% glycerol, 420 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA (pH 8), 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 0.5 mm dithiothreitol) and incubated on ice for 20 min. After a final 2-min spin, the supernatant (nuclear extract) was collected. The cytoplasmic or the nuclear extract containing 12 μg of proteins were resolved on 7.5% SDS-PAGE and subjected to Western blot analysis.RESULTSThe Mutant Containing the N-terminal Section of Stat3 Expresses Constitutively in the Nucleus—Generally, latent Stat3 proteins primarily localize in the cytoplasm and translocate into the nucleus after cytokine or growth factor stimulation. However, low levels of a ligand-independent constitutive nuclear expression of Stat1 and Stat3 were also reported in COS-1 and NIH 3T3 cells (39Meyer T. Gavenis K. Vinkemeier U. Exp. Cell Res. 2002; 272: 45-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 40Chatterjee-Kishore M. Wright K.L. Ting J.P. Stark G.R. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 4111-4122Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). In our previous studies, to map the interaction domain of Stat3 with its interacting protein, GRIM-19, we found that the mutant of Stat3 containing the N-terminal portion of Stat3 is constitutively localized in the nucleus in a breast cancer cell line, MCF-7 (34Lufei C. Ma J. Huang G. Zhang T. Novotny-Diermayr V. Ong C.T. Cao X. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 1325-1335Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). In this study, first we tried to confirm this observation in MCF-7 cells as well as in other cell types. Three large FLAG-tagged truncation mutants covering the N-terminal, the middle, or the C-terminal section of Stat3 protein were transfected into MCF-7 cells, and their cellular localizations were examined. The wild-type Stat3 is located in both the cytoplasm and the nucleus in unstimulated cells, as observed by indirect fluorescence. In sharp contrast, the mutant containing the N-terminal region (ST3-ND.4H) exclusively localized in the nucleus, whereas the mutant consisting of the middle (ST3-DB.LK) or the C-terminal section (ST3-SH2.CT) mainly expressed in the cytoplasm (Fig. 1B). A similar observation was also made in COS-1 cells (data not shown). These results suggested that the N-terminal domains of Stat3 contain a sequence for the nuclear localization.α-Helix 2 of the Coiled-coil Domain of Stat3 Harbors a Nuclear Localization Signal—The N-terminal region of Stat3 contains two functional domains: the N-domain (ND) and the coiled-coil domain (CC). The CC domain is composed of four antiparallel α helices, of which two are long (α1 and α2) and two are short (α3 and α4) helices (15Becker S. Groner B. Müller C.W. Nature. 1998; 394: 145-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (656) Google Scholar). To further delineate the region that is responsible for the nuclear import of Stat3, we constructed a series of truncation mutants by sequentially deleting the α-helices of the CC domain from the C terminus of ST3-ND.4H (Fig. 2A). The cellular localization of these mutants was examined in MCF-7 cells. The results showed that mutants ST3-ND.3H1–296 (lacking α-helix 4) and ST3-ND.2H1–260 (lacking α-helices 3 and 4) expressed in the nucleus. However, further deletion of α-helix 2 (ST3-ND.1H1–198) and α-helix 1 (ST3-ND) resulted in a loss of the exclusive nuclear localization, whereas ST3–4H, containing only the CC domain, predominantly localized in the nucleus (Fig. 2B).Fig. 2Identification of an NLS harbored in α-helix 2 region of Stat3. A, schematic diagram of the N-terminal domain and the coiled-coil domain and a series of deletion mutants generated. The nuclear localization ability of the mutants is summarized on the right. B and D, the FLAG-tagged mutants as labeled at the bottom were transfected into MCF-7 cells and the cellular localization was detected by immunofluorescence staining as described in Fig. 1. C, GFP and its fusion constructs (as labeled) were transfected into MCF-7 cells, and their cellular localization was examined by fluorescent microscopy.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)These results suggest an NLS exists in the CC domain. To confirm these results and to demonstrate that the NLS in the CC domain can promote nuclear import of a heterogeneous protein, the N-terminal fragments were linked to a GFP, and their cellular localization was examined. GFP alone expressed in the cytoplasm. However, the GFP fusion containing either the CC domain alone (ST3–4H-GFP) or together with ND (ST3-ND.4H-GFP) accumulated in the nucleus, but the GFP fusion containing ND alone (ST3-ND-GFP) localized mainly in the cytoplasm (Fig. 2C).To further map the NLS within the CC domain, α-helix 1 or 2 was removed individually from the mutant ST3-ND.4H (Fig. 2A). The results indicated that the mutant lacking α-helix 1 (ND.4H-ΔH1) accumulated in the nucleus, but the mutant deleting α-helix 2 (ND.4H-ΔH2) localized in the cytoplasm (Fig. 2D). Together, these data demonstrated that the α-helix 2 contains a potential NLS for nuclear localization.Identification of Arg-214/215 of Stat3 as a Novel Element for the EGF-induced Nuclear Translocation—To further define the sequence(s) important in the CC domain for Stat3 nuclear localization, we searched for the basic amino acid residues in the CC domain. Six stretches that contain double or triple basic amino acids (Arg-152/Lys-153/Arg-154, Lys-161/Lys-163, Lys-177/Lys-180, Arg-197/Lys-199, Arg-214/Arg-215, and Lys-244/Arg-245/Arg-246) were found and chosen for site-directed mutagenesis (Fig. 3A). These basic residues were replaced by alanine in the full-length Stat3. These point mutants were named according to the position of the mutations which are listed in the lower panel of Fig. 3B. COS-1 cells express low levels of endogenous Stat3 and respond to EGF strongly. We transfected these mutants to COS-1 cells and evaluated their cellular localizations in the cells either untreated or stimulated with EGF. Strikingly, in contrast to the wild-type Stat3 that was mostly distributed in the cytoplasm in the untreated cells and translocated into the nucleus upon EGF stimulation, a double mutant R214A/R215A with mutations in α-helix 2 failed to be translocated from the cytoplasm to the nucleus after EGF treatment (Fig. 3B). The rest mutants, on the other hand, behaved like the wild-type Stat3. This result indicated that residues Arg-214/215 are essential for the EGF-induced nuclear translocation of Stat3.Fig. 3Identification of Arg-214/215 and Arg-414/417 of Stat3 as required elements for the EGF-induced nuclear translocation. A, diagram indicating the positions of the stretches containing the basic amino acids in the α-helices 1 and 2 of the coiled-coil domain and the DB. ND represents N-terminal domain. The numbers indicate the amino acid residues. The mutants were prepared by replacing the respective double or triple basic amino acid residues by alanine in the full-length Stat3. The names of the point mutants are listed in the lower panel of B. B, the FLAG-tagged wild type Stat3 and the point mutants shown in A were transfected into COS-1 cells. Cells were either left untreated (–EGF) or treated with EGF (100 ng/ml) for 15 min. The cellular localization of the wtStat3 and the mutants R214A/R215A and R414A/R417A was examined in the absence or presence of EGF treatment. The mutants R152/K153/R154A containing point mutations in the α-helix 1 region and K363/365/370A-containing mutations in the DNA binding domain are displayed as representatives of the rest of the mutants. The nuclear translocation of all the point mutants in response to EGF is summarized. C, effect of LMB on the nuclear translocation of Stat3. FLAG-tagged wild-type Stat3 and mutant R214A/R215A and R414A/R417A were transfected into COS-1 cells. Cells were pretreated with LMB (10 nm) for 30 min followed by EGF stimulation for 30 min. The cellular localization of Stat proteins was examined with anti-FLAG antibody.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Arg-414/417 of Stat3 in the DB Domain Is Also Required for Stat3 Nuclear Translocation—The NLS of Stat1 and Stat5b was reported to be located in the DB domain (18Meyer T.

We therefore also searched basic residues in the DB domain of Stat3 and made five double or triple mutants (Arg-335/Lys-340, Lys-348/Arg-350/Lys-354, Lys-363/Lys-365/Lys-370, Arg-379/Arg-382/Lys-383) in the full-length Stat3. In addition, a single mutant with a mutation in Leu-411 corresponding to Leu-407 in Stat1 was also prepared. A similar experiment was performed with these mutants. We found that mutations in Arg-414/417, corresponding to Lys-410/413 of Stat1, lost its nuclear translocation induced by EGF, whereas the other mutants, including L411A, were able to be translocated into the nucleus (Fig. 3B). Together, these data suggest that two elements, Arg-214/215 in the CC domain and Arg-414/417 in the DB domain, are required for Stat3 nuclear translocation in response to EGF.Lack of nuclear accumulation of the mutants R214A/R215A and R414A/R417A could be due to effective nuclear export. To exclude this possibility, we pretreated cells with the nuclear export inhibitor, LMB, which inhibits Stat1 nuclear export by binding to the chromosome region maintenance-1/exportin1 shuttling receptor (41McBride K.M. McDonald C. Reich N.C. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 6196-6206Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The results showed that although the wild-type Stat3 accumulated highly in the"

Studies in ClC-5 knockout mice suggest that this phenotype is related to defective endocytosis of low molecular weight proteins and membrane proteins by the renal proximal tubule. In this study, confocal micrographs of proximal tubules and cultured epithelial cells revealed that the related protein ClC-4 is expressed in endosomal membranes suggesting that this channel may also contribute to the function of this organelle. In support of this hypothesis, specific disruption of endogenous ClC-4 expression by transfection of ClC-4 antisense cDNA acidified endosomal pH and altered transferrin trafficking in cultured epithelial cells to the same extent as the specific disruption of ClC-5. Both channels can be co-immunoprecipitated, arguing that they may partially contribute to endosomal function as a channel complex. These studies prompt future investigation of the role of ClC-4 in renal function in health and in Dent's disease. Future studies will assess whether the severity of Dent's disease relates not only to the impact of particular mutations on ClC-5 but also on the consequences of those mutations on the functional expression of ClC-4.

There are nine members of the ClC family of chloride channels in mammals, and several members have been implicated in congenital diseases. For example, mutations in ClCN1 cause congenital myotonia (1Steinmeyer K. Klocke R. Ortland C. Gronemeier M. Jockusch H. Grunder S. Jentsch T.J.

Friedrich W. Delling G. Jentsch T.J. Cell. 2001; 104: 205-215Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (813) Google Scholar). Each of these particular chloride channels belongs to distinct subgroups of the ClC family, defined on the basis of their degree of sequence similarity. ClC-1 is grouped with ClC-2, ClC-Ka, and ClC-Kb (7Jentsch T.J. Friedrich T. Schriever A. Yamada H. Pfluegers Arch. 1999; 437: 783-795Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). ClC-7 is most closely related to ClC-6 (7Jentsch T.J. Friedrich T. Schriever A. Yamada H. Pfluegers Arch. 1999; 437: 783-795Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). ClC-5, ClC-4, and ClC-3 form a distinct subgroup, sharing close to 80% sequence identity. The subgroup of ClC channels, including ClC-3, ClC-4, and ClC-5, is thought to function in intracellular compartments. For example, ClC-3 is localized in synaptic vesicles in neurons where it has been shown to contribute to vesicular acidification probably by providing an electrical shunt permissive to V-type ATPase activity (13Stobrawa S.M. Breiderhoff T. Takamori S. Engel D. Schweizer M. Zdebik A.A. Bosl M.R. Ruether K. Jahn H. Draguhn A. Jahn R. Jentsch T.J. Neuron. 2001; 29: 185-196Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar). In non-neuronal tissue, the shorter isoform (ClC-3A) has been localized to late endosomes and lysosomes where it is presumed to function in regulating the pH of these compartments (14Gentzsch M. Cui L. Mengos A. Chang X.B. Chen J.H. Riordan J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 6440-6449Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 15Li X. Wang T. Zhao Z. Weinman S.A. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 282: C1483-C1491Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). The function of the longer Golgi-localized isoform (ClC-3B) has yet to be determined (14Gentzsch M. Cui L. Mengos A. Chang X.B. Chen J.H. Riordan J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 6440-6449Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). ClC-5 is localized primarily in early endosomes in native tissues of rodent renal proximal tubules and in various heterologous expression systems (16Gunther W. Luchow A. Cluzeaud F. Vandewalle A. Jentsch T.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 8075-8080Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar, 17Schwake M. Friedrich T. Jentsch T.J. J. Biol.

Disruption of Clcn5 in mice leads to defective fluid phase and receptor-mediated endocytosis by the renal proximal tubule, arguing that ClC-5 contributes to endocytosis in vivo (16Gunther W. Luchow A. Cluzeaud F. Vandewalle A. Jentsch T.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 8075-8080Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar, 18Gunther W. Piwon N. Jentsch T.J.

Genet. 2000; 9: 2937-2945Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). On the basis of these studies, it has been hypothesized that ClCN5 mutations may lead to low molecular weight proteinuria and hypercalciuria in patients with Dent's disease because of defective internalization of protein and membrane receptors from the apical surface of the renal proximal tubule (19Piwon N. Gunther W. Schwake M. Bosl M.R. Jentsch T.J. Nature. 2000; 408: 369-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar). Furthermore, it was proposed that ClC-5 normally contributes to endocytosis by facilitating endosomal acidification, a phenomenon essential for appropriate vesicular trafficking (21van Weert A.W. Dunn K.W. Gueze H.J. Maxfield F.R. Stoorvogel W. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 821-834Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar, 22Presley J.F. Mayor S. McGraw T.E. Dunn K.W. Maxfield F.R. J. Biol.

Hypertens. 2002; 11: 527-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). As for ClC-3A, it has been suggested that ClC-5 may provide an electrical shunt for charge dissipation, thereby permitting endosomal acidification through the action of V-type ATPases (15Li X. Wang T. Zhao Z. Weinman S.A. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 282: C1483-C1491Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 24Jentsch T.J. Stein V. Weinreich F. Zdebik A.A. Physiol. Rev. 2002; 82: 503-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (1061) Google Scholar). In fact, endosomal vesicles purified from Clcn5 knockout mice exhibited slower rates of acidification than vesicles purified from their wild type siblings (18Gunther W. Piwon N. Jentsch T.J. Pfluegers Arch. 2003; 445: 456-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). However, a direct contribution of ClC-5 to this function in vivo has not yet been demonstrated. ClC-4 shares 78% sequence identity with ClC-5, and these two channels exhibit almost identical channel properties when studied in heterologous expression systems (25Friedrich T. Breiderhoff T. Jentsch T.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 896-902Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). However, unlike ClC-5, very little is known about the native expression and function of ClC-4 in epithelial cells. Recently, we generated a specific antibody against ClC-4, and we showed that in rodent and human intestinal epithelia, ClC-4 channels co-localize with the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator in the apical membrane and in subapical vesicles (26Mohammad-Panah R. Ackerley C. Rommens J. Choudhury M. Wang Y. Bear C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 566-574Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Significantly, a proportion of the intracellular vesicles bearing ClC-4 appeared to co-localize with the endosomal marker EEA1 (26Mohammad-Panah R. Ackerley C. Rommens J. Choudhury M. Wang Y. Bear C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 566-574Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), raising the possibility that ClC-4 may participate with ClC-5 in regulating the function of this organelle. The primary goal of the present project was to assess the role of ClC-4, relative to ClC-5, in endosomal trafficking in epithelial cells and to determine the mechanism underlying this putative function. We show for the first time that the specific depletion of ClC-4 reduces the rate of transferrin receptor recycling and that this reduction is associated with a defect in endosomal acidification. Hence, normal endosomal trafficking in epithelial cells may require the functional expression of ClC-4 as well as ClC-5. Constructs—The antisense murine ClC-4 was generated as described previously (26Mohammad-Panah R. Ackerley C. Rommens J. Choudhury M. Wang Y. Bear C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 566-574Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Similarly, the antisense human cDNA ClC-5 (ClC-5 cDNA was a gift from Dr. T. J. Jentsch) was generated by cloning the ClC-5 open reading frame with BamHI (5′) and EcoRI (3′) linkers on the forward and reverse primers, respectively. As described previously, the resulting PCR fragment was subcloned into pcDNA3.1 (–) to create the antisense plasmid. The HA 1The abbreviations used are: HA, hemagglutinin; FITC, fluorescein isothiocyanate; GFP, green fluorescent protein; Tfn, transferrin; GST, glutathione S-transferase; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; BSA, bovine serum albumin; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; Rhd, rhodamine. tag was inserted onto the amino terminus of hClC-5 with the help of BamHI-ATG-HA-hClC-5 oligonucleotide (+) and hClC-5 EcoRIstop (–)oligonucleotides. The subsequent PCR product was then subcloned into pCDNA 3.1 (+) with the BamHI and EcoRI linkers for eukaryotic expression. Pfu enzyme (Stratagene) was used for PCR, and sequencing was done with three different oligonucleotides that spanned the hClC-5 open reading frame. Tissues—Kidney tissues were obtained from adult male rats (Wistar) fed a standard diet. For immunofluorescence staining, we infused fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-labeled dextran, 10 kDa (1.75 mg/100 g body weight; Molecular Probes, Leiden, The Netherlands), dissolved in 0.5 ml of 0.9% NaCl, into the penile vein of a rat over a period of 30 s as described previously (27Obermuller N. Kranzlin B. Blum W.F. Gretz N. Witzgall R. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 280: F244-F253PubMed Google Scholar). Eight minutes after the injection of FITC-dextran, the infrarenal abdominal aorta was cannulated, and the rats were subjected to perfusion-fixation for subsequent visualization of FITC-dextran. Rats were perfused with 2% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) for 3 min and subsequently with a 18% sucrose solution in PBS for another 3 min. Kidneys were removed and cut along the longitudinal axis and incubated in a 18% sucrose/PBS solution, containing 0.02% sodium azide for 24 h at 4 °C. Tissues were then frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at –80 °C until use. Immunoblotting—Expression of ClC-4 and ClC-5 protein in Caco-2, CHO cells, and rat tissue was determined by immunoblotting as described previously (28Mohammad-Panah R. Gyomorey K. Rommens J.

The antiserum was pre-absorbed to a GST-coupled matrix to remove anti-GST antibodies. The signal recognized by anti-ClC-4 antibody is specific for ClC-4 as it is competed by the fusion peptide of the amino terminus of ClC-4 but not a fusion peptide containing the amino terminus of the closely related channel protein ClC-5 (26Mohammad-Panah R.

Furthermore, immunoreactive protein, migrating as a 90-kDa polypeptide in Western blots, is absent in immunoblots of tissue obtained from Clcn4 null mice. The anti-ClC-5 polyclonal antibody (a gift of Dr. T. Jentsch, Hamburg, Germany) was generated against a synthetic peptide (CKSRDRDRHREITNKS) representing a part of the amino terminus of ClC-5. This antibody was originally characterized and shown to be specific by Gunther et al. (16Gunther W. Luchow A. Cluzeaud F. Vandewalle A. Jentsch T.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 8075-8080Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar). Immunoreactive protein was detected using the ECL system (Amersham Biosciences). Culture and Transfection of Cells—Caco-2, CHO, and LLCPK1 cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). Cells were transfected using Lipofectin (Invitrogen), as described previously (26Mohammad-Panah R. Ackerley C. Rommens J. Choudhury M. Wang Y. Bear C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 566-574Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). For immunofluorescence studies, cells were used 1 day following transfection. Transferrin-Biotin Endocytosis Assay—Receptor-mediated endocytosis was measured by assaying the uptake of biotinylated human transferrin (Molecular Probes, Leislen, The Netherlands) by Caco2 cells. Cells were seeded onto 55-mm Petri dishes and grown to 50% confluency prior to transfection. 42 h post-transfection, cells were first serum-starved for 1 h and then incubated in serum-free media supplemented with 50 μg/ml biotinylated-transferrin for 20 min at 37 °C. Cells were then washed twice with cold PBS, pH 4.5, to remove surface-associated transferrin-biotin. Cells were lysed using SDS sample buffer and subjected to SDS-PAGE analysis. Internalized transferrin was detected using Extravidin (Sigma) and quantitated by band densitometry analysis using ImageJ software. Co-immunoprecipitations—CHO cells and kidney tissues were lysed in modified RIPA buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.05% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, and protease inhibitors: 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 mm benzamidine, E64 10 μm, and 2 mm dithiothreitol). Antibodies against ClC-4 or mouse influenza hemagglutinin (HA, Babco, Richmond, CA) were added to the supernatant, and the mixtures were incubated at 4 °C overnight. Protein G-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) beads were incubated with the antigen/antibody mixture at 4 °C for 2 h. Protein-antibody-bead complexes were washed with detergent-free RIPA buffer. The final washed pellet were eluted with the Laemmli buffer at 65 °C for 15 min. Eluant was subjected to 10 mm tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine treatment to reduce antibody disulfide bands and analyzed for the presence of ClC-4 and ClC-5 proteins. Patch Clamp Electrophysiology—Caco-2 cell membrane currents were measured using conventional whole cell patch clamp technique as described (26Mohammad-Panah R. Ackerley C. Rommens J. Choudhury M. Wang Y. Bear C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 566-574Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Data were collected and analyzed with an Axopatch-200A amplifier and pCLAMP software (Axon Instruments, Foster City, CA). The bath solution contained (in mm): 140 N-methyl-d-glutamine chloride, 2 MgCl2, 2 CaCl2, 5 HEPES, whereas the pipette solution contained (in mm) 140 N-methyl-d-glutamine-Cl, 2 MgCl2, 2 EGTA, and 5 HEPES. Both pipette and bath solutions were adjusted to pH 7.4. The tip resistance was 3–5 megohms when filled with the pipette solution. Endosomal pH measurements—Endosomal pH was determined using fluorescence ratio imaging as described (30Hackam D.J. Rotstein O.D. Zhang W.J. Demaurex N. Woodside M. Tsai O. Grinstein S. J. Biol.

Caco cells plated on coverslips were co-transfected with enhanced blue fluorescence protein and either vector control or ClC-4 or ClC-5 antisense and serum-starved overnight. Endosomes were loaded with 150 μg/ml FITC-transferrin in sodium-rich saline (140 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 5 mm glucose, 1 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4) for 30 min. Coverslips were washed and pulsed briefly with PBS (pH 5.0) to remove surface-bound FITC-transferrin before transferring to Leiden chambers for analysis. Transfected cells were identified using UV filters using a ×40 oil-immersion objective on a thermostatted Leiden holder of a Zeiss IM-35 microscope. Internalized FITC-transferrin was then excited at alternating wavelengths of 490 (700 ms) and 440 nm (100 ms) using a Sutter filter wheel. The fluorescent light was directed to a 535-nm emission filter placed before a cooled CCD camera used for fluorescent detection using 8 × 8 binning. Image acquisition was controlled using the Metafluor software (Universal Imaging Corp.). Images were captured at 2-min intervals. The fluorescence ratio versus pH was calibrated by equilibrating the cells in K+-rich medium (140 mm KCl, 10 mm NaCl, 5 mm glucose, 1 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4) adjusted to varying pH values (ranging from 7.3 to 5.7) containing 10 μm of nigericin and monensin. Endosomes were defined as regions of interest, and pixel intensity values were determined for resting endosomes and defined calibration pH acquisitions following background subtraction for both 490 (pH-dependent) and 440 nm (pH-independent). Calibration curves of the fluorescence ratio (490:440) were then plotted against pH, and endosomal pH values were extrapolated from the curve. Immunofluorescence—Immunofluorescence labeling was performed on 5-μm cryosections of rat kidney tissues and on Caco-2, CHO, COS-7, and LLCPK1 cells as described previously (28Mohammad-Panah R. Gyomorey K. Rommens J. Choudhury M. Li C. Wang Y. Bear C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 8306-8313Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The following primary antibodies were used: rabbit anti-ClC-5 (1:150), rabbit anti-ClC-4 antibody (1:200), and mouse HA antibody (1:1000, Babco, Richmond, CA). Cy3- or Cy5-conjugated or FITC-conjugated anti-rabbit or anti-mouse secondary antibodies (1:1000, Molecular Probes, Leiden, The Netherlands) were used for immunodetection. To study the localization of ClC-4 and ClC-5 proteins relative to transferrin-positive compartments, cells were serum-starved for 1 h at 37 °C in free serum medium (Invitrogen) and then loaded with 50 μg/ml transferrin conjugated to iron and tetramethylrhodamine (transferrin-Fe2+-Rhd, Molecular Probes, Leiden, The Netherlands) for 60 min. Following fixation, cells were labeled with ClC-4 or ClC-5 antibodies for subsequent immunolocalization. For kinetic analyses of transferrin internalization in control and ClC-4- and ClC-5-depleted (antisense-treated) cells, cells were serum-starved as above and then pulse-labeled for 2.5, 5, 10, 20, 40, and 60 min with 50 μg/ml transferrin-Fe2+-Rhd. To examine recycling, cells were pulse-labeled with 50 μg/ml transferrin-Fe2+-Rhd for 1 h and then washed and chase for 5, 20, 40, 60, and 80 min in medium containing 10% fetal calf serum. At the end of each labeling and chase interval, cells were washed and then fixed in cold 4% paraformaldehyde. Slides were viewed with a ×100 objective on a Carl Zeiss LSM 510 equipped with an Axiovert 100 confocal microscope. Quantification of Immunofluorescence—GFP-transfected cells were analyzed with respect to ClC channel-specific immunofluorescence (labeled with Cy3-conjugated secondary antibodies) or rhodamine-transferrin. Although cross-talk of the fluorophores into the wrong detectors was negligible, GFP fluorescence was specifically subtracted prior to Cy3 or rhodamine immunofluorescence measurements. All images were acquired using the palette function of LSM510 confocal acquisition software, which allows verification that the fluorescence intensity is in the linear range. The linear range is defined as 0 units = white and 255 units = black. The Cy3 or rhodamine-specific immunofluorescence was converted to a gray scale image, and the background (determined from the mean intensity detected in cell nuclei) was subtracted prior to quantitation. Mean pixel intensity of the gray scale image was measured (Scion Image software) for the outlined region of the whole cell or for the perinuclear region (by superpositioning a box at 8 locations around the nucleus). Data were plotted, and the half-times for transferrin internalization or recycling were determined by fitting logarithmic or monoexponential decay functions, respectively, to data acquired at different time points using Origin software (Microcal Origin). Electron Microscopy—CHO cells co-transfected with both Rab5a-GFP and HA-ClC-5 cDNA were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde and 0.1% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 m phosphate buffer, pH 7.4. They were then harvested with a rubber policeman, drawn off the culture dish, and lightly centrifuged into a mm3 pellet in a microcentrifuge tube. They were fixed for an additional 4 h and washed in PBS containing 20 mm azide and stored at 4 °C until further processing. Prior to cryo-ultramicrotomy the cells were infiltrated with a solution of 10% gelatin in PBS at 37 °C, allowed to gel at 4 °C, and infused with 2.3 m sucrose overnight. Blocks of gelatin containing cells were attached to aluminum pins, frozen in liquid nitrogen, and cut at –95 °C on a diamond knife ∼100 nm thick using a Leica Ultracut R with a cryo-chamber (Leica Canada, Willowdale, Ontario, Canada). Sections were transferred to Formvar-coated grids in a drop of molten sucrose, and the aldehyde residues were blocked with a solution of PBS containing 0.15% glycine and 0.5% BSA. Samples were rinsed several times with PBS with just BSA prior to incubation in a polyclonal rabbit antibody against ClC-4 for 1 h. Grids were then washed in PBS/BSA thoroughly and incubated for another hour in goat anti-rabbit IgG 10-nm gold complexes (Amersham Biosciences). Again after rinses in PBS/BSA samples were incubated for 1 h in a monoclonal antibody against GFP. This was followed by more washes and another 1 h of incubation in goat anti-mouse IgG 5-nm gold complexes (Amersham Biosciences). Grids were thoroughly washed with PBS followed by distilled water. They were then stabilized in a thin film of methylcellulose containing 0.2% uranyl acetate. Controls included the omission of the primary antisera or the IgG gold complexes. Specimens were examined and images acquired with a JEOL JEM transmission electron microscope (JEOL, Peabody, MA) equipped with a digital camera (AMT Corp. Danvers, MA). Statistics—Statistical analyses, analysis of variance followed by Bonferoni's non-paired”t“test, were conducted using Prism software, and p values of 0.05 or less were considered significant. ClC-4 Is Expressed in the Renal Proximal Tubule—Previously, we showed that a polyclonal, affinity-purified antibody directed against the amino terminus of ClC-4 labels a 90–97-kDa protein in immunoblots of rat brain tissue. This band was competed using the amino terminus of ClC-4, and not the amino terminus of the related protein ClC-5, attesting to its specificity (26Mohammad-Panah R. Ackerley C. Rommens J. Choudhury M. Wang Y. Bear C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 566-574Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). In Fig. 1A, we show that only this band is detected in whole mouse brain and is completely absent in immunoblots performed using brain tissue obtained from two Clcn4 null mice, providing compelling evidence in support of the specificity of this antibody. Clcn4 null mice were generated by breeding two strains of mice, Mus spretus and C57BL/6J, as described previously by Rugarli et al. (32Rugarli E.I. Adler D.A. Borsani G. Tsuchiya K. Franco B. Hauge X. Disteche C. Chapman V. Ballabio A. Nat. Genet. 1995; 10: 466-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Clcn4 is located on the X chromosome in the M. spretus strain and on chromosome 7 in the C57BL/6J strain permitting the generation of a population of male mice devoid of Clcn4 through backcrossing C57CL/6J × M. spetus F1 females with M. spretus males. To date, however, only two Clcn4 null mice have been produced during 6 months due the difficulty involved in breeding these two strains. Therefore, the following in vivo studies of ClC-4 function were performed in rats or using an antisense strategy in established intestinal and renal cell lines. In Fig. 1B, we show that ClC-4 protein is expressed as a 90–97-kDa protein in immunoblots of total rat kidney lysates. Confocal micrographs (Fig. 1C) reveal that ClC-4-specific immunofluorescence is expressed in the epithelium of the proximal tubule. The apical aspect of the epithelium of the proximal tubule was defined visually by in vivo injection of fluorescein-labeled dextran (FITC-dextran), known to be internalized by this tissue via fluid phase endocytosis. As described in previously published studies (27Obermuller N. Kranzlin B. Blum W.F. Gretz N. Witzgall R. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 280: F244-F253PubMed Google Scholar), 8 min after injection, FITC-dextran will have been filtered through the glomerulus and internalized across the apical membrane of the epithelium of the proximal tubule by endocytosis. After this perfusion time, the kidneys were fixed in situ and flash-frozen. Confocal micrographs of frozen sections confirmed that FITC-dextran (27Obermuller N. Kranzlin B. Blum W.F. Gretz N. Witzgall R. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 280: F244-F253PubMed Google Scholar) can be detected close to the apical membrane and in sub-apical vesicles of the proximal renal tubule epithelium. These same sections were labeled using the ClC-4 antibody described above, and we observed that the pattern of ClC-4-specific immunofluorescence overlapped with that of FITC-dextran (Fig. 1C). These findings are similar to those reported for the related protein ClC-5 (16Gunther W. Luchow A. Cluzeaud F. Vandewalle A. Jentsch T.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 8075-8080Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar) and suggest that both channels are expressed in the proximal tubule, probably in the apical membrane and sub-apical membrane vesicles. Expression of ClC-4 or ClC-5 Channels Can Be Specifically Depleted in Caco-2 Cells Using an Antisense Strategy—We used an antisense strategy to determine the relative functional expression of ClC-4 and ClC-5 endogenously expressed in epithelial cells. As both channel proteins are endogenously expressed in the Caco-2 cell line (26Mohammad-Panah R. Ackerley C. Rommens J. Choudhury M. Wa"
https://openalex.org/W2087243137,"Autosomal recessive hypercholesterolemia (ARH) is a genetic form of hypercholesterolemia that clinically resembles familial hypercholesterolemia (FH). As in FH, the rate of clearance of circulating low density lipoprotein (LDL) by the LDL receptor (LDLR) in the liver is markedly reduced in ARH. Unlike FH, LDL uptake in cultured fibroblasts from ARH patients is normal or only slightly impaired. The gene defective in ARH encodes a putative adaptor protein that has been implicated in linking the LDLR to the endocytic machinery. To determine the role of ARH in the liver, ARH-deficient mice were developed. Plasma levels of LDL-cholesterol were elevated in the chow-fed Arh–/– mice (83 ± 8 mg/dl versus 68 ± 8 mg/dl) but were lower than those of mice expressing no LDLR (Ldlr–/–) (197 ± 8 mg/dl). Cholesterol feeding elevated plasma cholesterol levels in both strains. The fractional clearance rate of radiolabeled LDL was reduced to similar levels in the Arh–/– and Ldlr–/– mice, whereas the rate of removal of α2-macroglobulin by the LDLR-related protein, which also interacts with ARH, was unchanged. Immunolocalization studies revealed that a much greater proportion of immunodetectable LDLR, but not LDLR-related protein, was present on the sinusoidal surface of hepatocytes in the Arh–/– mice. Taken together, these results are consistent with ARH playing a critical and specific role in LDLR endocytosis in the liver.

Approximately 70% of cholesterol in human plasma is contained in the LDL fraction. The major fate of circulating LDL is uptake into the liver by LDLR-mediated endocytosis (1Osono Y. Woollett L.A.

The rate of removal of LDL from the plasma is a key determinant of plasma cholesterol levels. Reductions in hepatic LDLR number or activity result in elevated plasma levels of LDL-C. The most common monogenic cause of severe hypercholesterolemia is the autosomal dominant disorder, familial hypercholesterolemia (FH), caused by mutations in LDLR (2Goldstein J. Hobbs H. Brown M.

Science. 2001; 292: 1310-1312Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). FH homozygotes, who have mutations in both LDLR alleles, have a markedly decreased rate of removal of circulating LDL and a dramatic increase in plasma cholesterol levels (2Goldstein J. Hobbs H.

Recently, the molecular defect for a recessive form of hypercholesterolemia that clinically resembles FH but is not due to mutations in LDLR was identified (4Garcia C.K. Wilund K. Arca M. Zuliani G.

Adaptor proteins containing PTB domains bind the conserved NPXY sequence motif located in the cytoplasmic domains of various cell surface receptors and mediate diverse cellular functions, including receptor trafficking and endocytosis (12Forman-Kay J.D.

In addition to binding the LDLR tail, ARH also binds the β2-adaptin subunit of AP-2 and the terminal domain of clathrin in a sequence-specific manner in vitro, so it has been proposed to link the LDLR to the endocytic machinery (4Garcia C.K.

In support of this scenario, immortalized lymphocytes from ARH subjects are defective in LDL internalization (7Norman D. Sun X.-M. Bourbon M. Knight B.L. Naoumova R.P. Soutar A.K. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 104: 619-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Although human studies suggest that ARH is required specifically for normal LDLR function, it may also be involved in the internalization of other proteins containing an NPXY motif in the cytoplasmic tail, such as other members of the LDLR gene family. For instance, the LDLR-related protein (LRP) contains two NPXY motifs. One of them binds the PTB domain protein Dab1, an adaptor protein that is involved in the control of neuronal migration and signaling through LDLR family members and that also interacts with the LDLR (17Trommsdorff M.

LRP is abundantly expressed in the liver, where it functions in concert with the LDLR in the clearance of chylomicron remnants (19Willnow T.E. Sheng Z. Ishibashi S. Herz J. Science. 1994; 264: 1471-1474Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar, 20Rohlmann A. Gotthardt M. Hammer R.E. Herz J. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 689-695Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar), but it is unknown whether LRP also functionally interacts with ARH. In the initial three ARH patients examined, an accumulation of chylomicron remnants was not reported (6Zuliani G. Arca M. Signore A. Bader G. Fazio S. Chianelli M. Bellosta S. Campagna F. Montali A. Maioli M. Pacifico A. Ricci G. Fellin R. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1999; 19: 802-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), suggesting that ARH may not be required for normal LRP endocytosis. The currently available limited data from human subjects suggest that ARH function may be tissue-specific, inasmuch as LDL internalization in ARH patients was found to be defective in the liver and in lymphoblasts, but is apparently largely normal in fibroblasts from the same patients. To facilitate the investigation of ARH function in the liver, the central organ that regulates LDL metabolism, we have now generated ARH-deficient mice by gene targeting. These animals replicate central features of the human disease phenotype, including abnormal sequestration of the LDLR at the cell surface and reduced internalization of LDLR but not LRP. ARH-deficient mice are currently the only physiological model system on which the role of this specialized adaptor protein in receptor-mediated endocytosis can be experimentally investigated. General Methods—Unless otherwise indicated, DNA manipulations were performed by standard techniques (21Sambrook J. Russel D.W. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2001Google Scholar). Cholesterol and triglycerides were determined enzymatically with assay kits obtained from Roche Applied Science and Sigma, respectively. Mouse LDL (d 1.019–1.063 g/ml) was isolated by sequential ultracentrifugation (22Goldstein J.L. Basu S.K. Brown M.S. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 98: 241-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (1284) Google Scholar) from pooled plasma obtained from Ldlr–/– mice (23Ishibashi S. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Gerard R.D. Hammer R.E. Herz J.

Basu S.K. Brown M.S. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 98: 241-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (1284) Google Scholar). Methylamine-activated α2-macroglobulin was radiolabeled with 125I using the iodogen method as described previously (24Fraker P.J. Speck Jr., J.C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1978; 80: 849-857Crossref PubMed Scopus (3626) Google Scholar). Antibodies—Rabbit polyclonal antibodies against Rab5 (KAP-GP006), EEA1 (324610), and GRP78 (BiP) (SPA-826) were purchased from StressGen Biotechnologies (Victoria, BC, Canada) and Calbiochem. Rabbit polyclonal antibodies against Lamp1 (H-228) and Rab11 (H-87) were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Polyclonal antibodies were raised in rabbits against the PTB domain of mouse ARH and the C-terminal 13 residues of mouse LDLR. Rabbit polyclonal antibodies against LRP and purified LDLR from bovine adrenal have been described elsewhere (25Herz J. Hamann U. Rogne S. Myklebost O. Gausepohl H. Stanley K.K.

Cloning of Mouse ARH cDNA—Murine ARH cDNA was amplified from a commercially available mouse liver cDNA library (Clontech) using the following primers: 5′-ATTCTAGACATGGACGCGCTCAAGTCGGCG-3′ and 5′-TTAAGCTTTCAGAAGGTGAAGACGTCATCATC-3′. Amplification products were TA-cloned into pCR2.1-TOPO (Invitrogen) and sequenced. Generation of ARH Knockout Mice—Two fragments were amplified from genomic DNA from mouse liver (129S6/SvEv strain) using long range PCR (Takara Biochemical, Inc., Berkeley, CA). An 8.5-kb fragment, corresponding to a region extending from intron 4 into the 3′-untranslated region, was derived using primers 5LA1 (5′-ACGGCGGCCGCCTGTGTGGCCTGAGTCCCTCCCTGG-3′) and 3LA1 (5′-CCTGCGGCCGCCGCCAGCATGAGCAAGC-3′), and a 1-kb fragment containing part of intron 3 was amplified using primers 5SA (5′-ACGCTCGAGGTGTGCCAGTGGGGAACCAGGAAGG-3′) and 3SA (5′-TGCCTCGAGGGGAGATGGAAATAAGAAATGAAGGAAGC-3′). Bold characters indicate inserted restriction sites. The two fragments were cloned into the targeting vector (27Gotthardt M. Hammer R.E. Hubner N. Monti J. Witt C.C. McNabb M. Richardson J.A.

The vector also contained two copies of the herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase gene (29Mansour S.L. Thomas K.R. Capecchi M.R. Nature. 1988; 336: 348-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (1325) Google Scholar) in tandem at the 5′ end of the short arm. The linearized vector was electroporated into murine embryonic SM1 stem cells, and recombinant clones were selected using G418 and ganciclovir, as described (30Willnow T.E. Herz J. Methods Cell Biol. 1994; 43: 305-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Homologous recombination was identified by PCR (28Soriano P. Montgomery C. Geske R. Bradley A. Cell. 1991; 64: 693-702Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1799) Google Scholar) using primers ARH-T (5′-ACGCTCGAGCAGCCCAAATCCATGCTATCCATGGAC-3′) and Neo-36 (5′-CAGGACAGCAAGGGGGAGGATTGGGAAGAC-3′) and confirmed by Southern blot analysis after EcoRI and SacI digestion. Twelve independent stem cell clones containing a disrupted arh allele were injected into C57Bl/6 blastocysts, yielding a total of 18 chimeric males. Of these, 17 were fertile, and 6 gave offspring that carried the disrupted allele. Two separate lines were established for experimentation. No differences were detected between the two lines. Animals were genotyped by allele-specific PCR, using three primers. Primer ARH-T was used as the upstream oligonucleotide, whereas primers Neo-36 and ARH-GW (5′-CCTGTACTCCCAGACTACTTCATGATCCCCAC-3′) were used as the downstream primers for the disrupted and wild-type alleles, respectively. Animal Housing and Feeding—Mice were housed on a 12-h dark/12-h light cycle and given standard chow (number 7002; Harlan Teklad, Madison, WI) and water ad libitum. In cholesterol feeding experiments, animals were either fed the Paigen high cholesterol diet (1.25% cholesterol, 7.5% cocoa butter, 7.5% casein, and 0.5% cholic acid) or fed a Western-type diet containing 0.2% cholesterol (31Plump A.S.

All experiments were performed with F2 or F3 generation descendents, which were hybrids between C57Bl/6 and 129Sv strains. No differences in the results were observed when littermates were used in the experiments or when animals from vertically inbred lines were compared. Clearance of LDL and α2-Macroglobulin from Plasma—Clearance of lipoprotein and α2-macroglobulin (α2M) was determined as described previously (23Ishibashi S. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Gerard R.D. Hammer R.E. Herz J. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 92: 883-893Crossref PubMed Scopus (1273) Google Scholar, 32Choi S.Y. Cooper A.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15804-15811Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, mice were anesthetized with sodium pentobarbital (80 mg/kg) and injected via the external jugular vein with a 0.2-ml intravenous bolus of either 15 μg of 125I-LDL or 5 μg of 125I-α2M in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 0.2% (w/v) bovine serum albumin. At various time points, blood samples were drawn from the retro-orbital plexus into EDTA-coated tubes (Microvette 500 KE, Sarstedt, Newton, NC). The plasma content of 125I-labeled protein was measured by trichloroacetic acid precipitation followed by γ counting. The amount of LDL or α2M remaining in the blood was expressed as a percent of the initial blood concentration, measured as the average 125I-radioactivity in the plasma 2 min after injection. Interaction of ARH PTB Domain with Lipoprotein Receptor Cytoplasmic Tails—The LDLR family cytoplasmic tails/LexA fusion protein constructs and the Dab1 prey construct have been described previously (33Gotthardt M.

The ARH-PTB domain was amplified from the cloned cDNA using the primers 5APY (5′-ATGGAATTCAGCCTCAAGTACCTTGGTATGACG-3′) and 3APY (5′-TTGTCGACTCAGGACACCTGCCAAAACTCAAAGGC-3′). Bold characters indicate inserted restriction sites. The resulting PCR product was digested with EcoRI and SalI, inserted into the EcoRI-XhoI-digested prey vector pB42AD (MATCHMAKER system, Clontech), and sequenced. Yeast transformations and matings were performed following the manufacturer's instructions in the MATCHMAKER manual, and interactions were assessed as described previously (33Gotthardt M.

Immunohistochemistry—Anesthetized mice were perfused by cardiac puncture with warm Hank's balanced salt solution followed by 4% (w/v) paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline. The livers were removed and divided into 0.5-cm2 sections. The tissue was fixed for an additional hour at 25 °C in 4% (w/v) paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline followed by an overnight incubation in 30% (w/v) sucrose solution. The tissue was frozen in OCT compound 4583 (Miles Laboratories, Elkhart, IN) over dry ice and stored at –70 °C until cutting. Sections of 7 μm were cut on a Leitz Cryostat (E. Leitz, Inc., Rockleigh, NJ) at –20 °C and mounted onto poly-l-lysine-coated slides. Samples were blocked by incubation for 1 h with 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 9.0, 150 mm NaCl (Tris-buffered saline) containing 20% (v/v) normal goat serum and 1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin. Sections were then incubated overnight with rabbit antiserum raised against the PTB domain of ARH (1:800 dilution), rabbit antiserum against LRP (25Herz J. Hamann U. Rogne S. Myklebost O. Gausepohl H. Stanley K.K. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 4119-4127Crossref PubMed Scopus (738) Google Scholar) (1:200), or polyclonal rabbit IgG directed against the LDLR (26Russell D.W. Schneider W.J. Yamamoto T. Luskey K.L. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Cell. 1984; 37: 577-585Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar) (1:400). Slides were washed three times in Tris-buffered saline/0.1% bovine serum albumin, and bound primary antibody was detected by incubation for 2 h with 20 μg/ml Alexa-Fluor 488-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). Slides were washed three times in Tris-buffered saline/0.1% bovine serum albumin, rinsed once with water, and mounted under a coverslip with Immu-mount (Shandon, Pittsburgh, PA). Images were taken using the 63 × 0.70 objective on a Leica confocal microscope. Sucrose Gradients—Male wild-type, Arh–/–, and Ldlr–/– mice aged 15 weeks were fasted for 6 h and sacrificed. The livers were removed, rinsed briefly in cold phosphate-buffered saline, and minced in a weigh boat over ice. The minced liver was homogenized at 20% (w/v) in cold homogenization buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 250 mm sucrose, 25 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 3 mm imidazole, Roche protease inhibitor mixture) with 20 strokes in a Dounce homogenizer. Nuclei and other debris were removed by low speed centrifugation at 1000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. 300 μl of the supernatant was loaded on a 4-ml continuous 10–40% sucrose gradient and centrifuged using a Beckman SW60 Ti rotor for 16 h at 40,000 rpm, as described previously (34Stockinger W. Sailler B. Strasser V. Recheis B. Fasching D. Kahr L. Schneider W.J. Nimpf J. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 4259-4267Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). A 20-gauge needle was used to puncture the bottom of each tube, and ∼200-μl fractions were collected. Protein was precipitated with trichloroacetic acid, neutralized with NaOH, and dissolved in 100 μl of sample buffer. A 10-μl aliquot was used for Western blotting. Generation of ARH-deficient Mice—To disrupt the Arh gene in the mouse, targeted homologous recombination was used to replace exon 4 of Arh with a neomycin resistance cassette (Fig. 1A). Gene disruption was confirmed by Southern blotting (Fig. 1B). Deletion of exon 4 disrupts the PTB domain and is predicted to render the protein unable to bind the NPXY motifs of LDLR family members. If splicing occurs between exons 3 and 5, a frameshift and nonsense mutation would be introduced upstream of the putative binding sites for clathrin and AP-2 (10He G. Gupta S. Yi M. Michaely P. Hobbs H.H. Cohen J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 44044-44049Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). No immunoreactive ARH protein was detected in liver lysates of mice homozygous for the disruption using an antibody directed against the PTB domain (Fig. 1C). Levels of both LDLR and LRP protein were unchanged in the Arh–/– mice. Arh–/– mice were fertile and had normal litter sizes. Arh–/– Mice Are Hypercholesterolemic and Sensitive to Dietary Cholesterol—Plasma cholesterol levels were only mildly elevated in the chow-fed Arh–/– mice and not significantly different in heterozygous mice when compared with wild-type littermate controls (Table I and Fig. 2A). Female Arh+/–, Arh–/–, Ldlr–/–, and wild-type mice were fed chow alone, chow supplemented with 0.2% cholesterol-containing Western-type diet, or chow supplemented with 1.25% cholesterol (Paigen diet) for 4 weeks. On the chow diet, the mean plasma level of cholesterol in the ARH–/– mice was intermediate (83 mg/dl) to the wild-type (68 mg/dl) and Ldlr–/– mice (196 mg/dl). On the Western diet, plasma cholesterol levels were increased to a similar level in the Arh–/– and Ldlr–/– mice (Table I and Fig. 2A). Feeding of the Paigen diet resulted in dramatic elevations of plasma cholesterol levels to an average of 1270 mg/dl for the Arh–/– mice and 1442 mg/dl for the Ldlr–/– mice. No significant differences were seen in plasma lipid levels between the Arh+/– mice and wild-type mice on any of the diets, which is consistent with the autosomal recessive inheritance pattern of ARH in humans. Liver cholesterol and triglyceride levels were not elevated in the Arh–/– mice over their wild-type littermates (Table I).Table ICholesterol and triglyceride levels in response to cholesterol feeding0.02% cholesterol0.2% cholesterol1.25% cholesterol/0.5% cholic acidPlasma cholesterol (mg/dl)Wild type67.7 ± 8.1125.9 ± 38.5184.9 ± 35.8ARH+/-94.6 ± 18.5157.1 ± 22.3155.7 ± 25.2ARH-/-83.1 ± 7.9307.9 ± 62.91270.0 ± 7.9LDLR-/-196.4 ± 7.6239.1 ± 80.51442.4 ± 42.0Plasma triglycerides (mg/dl)Wild type58.8 ± 4.556.6 ± 9.647.2 ± 5.0ARH+/-56.2 ± 9.361.4 ± 6.546.2 ± 1.8ARH-/-58.7 ± 7.8100.0 ± 12.549.0 ± 10.4LDLR-/-97.4 ± 12.194.8 ± 22.7129.2 ± 1.4Liver tissue cholesterol (mg/g)Wild type2.64 ± 0.056.80 ± 1.7319.58 ± 0.75ARH+/-2.69 ± 0.1010.44 ± 2.6415.97 ± 2.00ARH-/-2.67 ± 0.156.76 ± 0.7523.23 ± 0.21LDLR-/-3.27 ± 0.334.46 ± 0.4020.96 ± 0.76Liver tissue triglycerides (mg/g)Wild type26.0 ± 3.127.3 ± 6.729.0 ± 1.2ARH+/-22.3 ± 7.533.5 ± 2.419.9 ± 7.0ARH-/-22.9 ± 8.338.6 ± 10.821.5 ± 7.7LDLR-/-26.4 ± 6.136.3 ± 11.111.3 ± 0.7 Open table in a new tab To determine the distribution of cholesterol in the lipoprotein fractions, pooled plasma from mice of the same genotype on the different diets was subjected to fast protein liquid chromatography. On the regular chow diet, there was very little accumulation of LDL in the Arh–/– animals (Fig. 2B). On the cholesterol-enriched diets, most of the cholesterol was in the LDL fraction in Arh–/– and in Ldlr–/– mice (Fig. 2, C and D). The relative increase in LDL-C in the mice of different genotypes was estimated by taking the sum of the cholesterol content of each column fraction in the LDL peak. On the chow diet, LDL-C was increased 1.4-fold in the Arh–/– mice relative to wild-type littermates, and the difference between the plasma cholesterol levels of these two strains increased further after cholesterol feeding. On a Western diet, the mean LDL-C level was 4.7-fold higher in the Arh–/– mice than in the littermate controls and 7.3-fold higher than the Arh–/– mice on a chow diet. In contrast to these results, plasma LDL-C levels increased only 2-fold in Ldlr–/– mice fed with the Western-type diet. Plasma LDL-C levels were increased 11-fold in the Arh–/– mice on the Paigen diet when compared with wild-type littermates and 42-fold when compared with chow-fed Arh–/– mice. Ldlr–/– mice on the Paigen diet had LDL-C levels that were similar to those of Arh–/– mice on the same diet. LDL-C levels of Ldlr–/– animals were 12-fold increased over wild-type mice fed the same diet and 11-fold increased over Ldlr–/– mice that had been fed a 0.2% cholesterol-containing Western-diet. Thus, cholesterol feeding was associated with a more dramatic elevation of cholesterol in the Arh–/– mice. Clearance of 125I-labeled LDL Is Reduced in Arh–/– Mice—To determine the effect of ARH deficiency on hepatic LDLR function, we compared the rates of removal of 125I-labeled LDL from the circulation of Arh–/– mice to wild-type and Ldlr–/– mice.

https://openalex.org/W2040015936,"The adenovirus E1A oncoprotein stimulates cell growth and inhibits differentiation by deregulating the normal transcription program via interaction with positive and negative cellular effectors. E1A associates with transcriptional regulatory complexes containing p400 and TRRAP involved in chromatin remodeling and decondensation. TRRAP is a component of three distinct human histone acetyltransferase (HAT) complexes: the TIP60 complex and complexes containing GCN5 or PCAF. We demonstrate here that E1A binds a TRRAP complex that contains the GCN5 acetyltransferase during a normal adenovirus infection. E1A binds GCN5 and TRRAP in vivo early after virus infection. E1A is associated with significant HAT activity in vitro that is partly attributable to GCN5. E1A represses c-Myc- and E2F-1-directed transcriptional activation in vivo by sequestering GCN5 and/or TRRAP. Our results demonstrate that E1A distinctly binds TRRAP/GCN5, p300/CBP and PCAF HAT complexes. Through interactions with multiple HAT complexes, E1A may deregulate cellular transcription programs and facilitate infection by recruiting functional HAT coactivators to viral and cellular promoter regions."
https://openalex.org/W2137195001,"It has heretofore been assumed that the cyclooxygenases (COXs) are solely responsible for peostaglandin (PG) synthesis in vivo. An important structural feature of PGH2 formed by COX is the trans-configuration of side chains relative to the prostane ring. Previously, we reported that a series of PG-like compounds termed isoprostanes (IsoPs) are formed in vivo in humans from the free radical-catalyzed peroxidation of arachidonate independent of COX. A major difference between these compounds and PGs is that IsoPs are formed from endoperoxide intermediates, the vast majority of which contain side chains that are cis relative to the prostane ring. In addition, unlike the formation of eicosanoids from COX, IsoPs are formed as racemic mixtures because they are generated nonenzymatically. IsoPs containing E- and D-type prostane rings (E2/D2-IsoPs) are one class of IsoPs formed, and we have reported previously that one of the major IsoPs generated is 15-E2t-IsoP (8-iso-PGE2). Unlike PGE2, 15-E2t-IsoP is significantly more unstable in buffered solutions in vitro and undergoes epimerization to PGE2. Analogously, the D-ring IsoP (15-D2c-IsoP) would be predicted to rearrange to PGD2. We now report that compounds identical in all respects to PGE2 and PGD2 and their respective enantiomers are generated in vivo via the IsoP pathway, presumably by epimerization of racemic 15-E2t-IsoP and 15-D2c-IsoP, respectively. Racemic PGE2 and PGD2 were present esterified in phospholipids derived from liver tissue from rats exposed to oxidant stress at levels of 24 ± 16 and 37 ± 12 ng/g of tissue, respectively. In addition, racemic PGs, particularly PGD2, were present unesterified in urine from normal animals and humans and represented up to 10% of the total PG detected. Levels of racemic PGD2 increased 35-fold after treatment of rats with carbon tetrachloride to induce oxidant stress. In this setting, PGD2 and its enantiomer generated by the IsoP pathway represented ∼30% of the total PGD2 present in urine. These findings strongly support the contention that a second pathway exists for the formation of bioactive PGs in vivo that is independent of COX.

Drug Metab. Rev. 1999; 31: 117-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Although the structures of these compounds are very similar to COX-derived PGs, an important distinction between IsoPs and PGs is that IsoP bicycloendoperoxide intermediates contain side chains that are predominantly (>90%) oriented cis in relation to the prostane ring because the generation of these intermediates is favored kinetically (4O'Connor D.E. Mihelich E.D. Coleman M.C. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1984; 106: 3577-3584Crossref Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 7Morrow J.D. Chen Y. Brame C.J. Yang J. Sanchez S.C. Xu J. Zackert W.E. Awad J.A. Roberts L.J.

Indeed, we have previously reported that two IsoPs that are formed in abundance in vivo are 15-F2t-IsoP (8-iso-PGF2α) and 15-E2t-IsoP (8-iso-PGE2), which are generated from the endoperoxide intermediate 15-H2t-IsoP (8-iso-PGH2) (Fig. 1B) (9Morrow J.D. Minton T.A. Badr K.F. Roberts L.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1210: 244-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar, 10Morrow J.D. Scruggs J. Chen Y. Zackert W.E. Roberts L.J. J. Lipid Res. 1998; 39: 1589-1593Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although not reported, it would also be predicted that 15-H2c-IsoP (12-iso-PGH2) is formed in abundance and can rearrange to the analogous D-ring IsoP 15-D2c-IsoP (12-iso-PGD2) (Fig. 1C). In contrast to other types of prostanoids, E2/D2-IsoPs are β-hydroxyketone-containing compounds that can undergo reversible keto-enol tautomerization under both acidic and basic conditions, allowing rearrangement of the side chains that are initially cis to the more stable trans-configuration. That the trans-configuration is highly favored has been demonstrated by the finding that, when PGE2 is subjected to conditions that induce keto-enol tautomerism, <10% of the compound rearranges to the cis-side chain isomer 15-E2t-IsoP (11Daniels E.G. Krueger W.C. Kupiecki F.P. Pike J.E. Schneider W.P. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1968; 90: 5894-5895Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). In addition, attempts to synthesize 15-D2c-IsoP have been unsuccessful because epimerization at C-12 readily occurs during synthesis to yield PGD2 (12Taber D.F. Kanai K. J. Org. Chem. 1998; 63: 6607-6609Crossref Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Furthermore, facile epimerization of a number of other PG-like compounds containing side chains cis to the prostane ring has been reported (13Marino J.P. Fernandez de la Pradilla R. Laborde E. J. Org. Chem. 1987; 52: 4898-4913Crossref Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 14Roth G.J. Kirschbaum S. Bestmann H.J. Synlett. 1997; : 618-620Crossref Scopus (28) Google Scholar). In the course of studies to characterize various E/D-ring IsoPs formed in vitro and in vivo from the peroxidation of arachidonic acid, analysis of oxidation products by gas chromatography (GC)/mass spectrometry (MS) disclosed the generation of significant amounts of compounds that had retention times and molecular weights identical to those of PGE2 and PGD2. Because IsoPs are formed nonenzymatically, compounds generated by this pathway would be predicted to be racemic (6Morrow J.D. Hill K.E. Burk R.F. Nammour T.M. Badr K.F. Roberts L.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 9383-9387Crossref PubMed Scopus (1719) Google Scholar, 7Morrow J.D. Chen Y. Brame C.J. Yang J. Sanchez S.C. Xu J. Zackert W.E. Awad J.A. Roberts L.J. Drug Metab. Rev. 1999; 31: 117-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Using a variety of chromatographic and mass spectrometric approaches, we present evidence that compounds identical in all respects to COX-derived PGE2 and PGD2 and their respective enantiomers are formed in vitro and in vivo via the IsoP pathway. A proposed mechanism by which the formation of PGE2 and PGD2 occurs from 15-E2t-IsoP and 15-D2c-IsoP, respectively, via base-catalyzed isomerization is shown in Fig. 2 (A and B). Generation of PGE2 and PGD2 from 15-E2t-IsoP and 15-D2c-IsoP, respectively, would also be predicted to occur via acid catalysis (11Daniels E.G. Krueger W.C. Kupiecki F.P. Pike J.E. Schneider W.P. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1968; 90: 5894-5895Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). These findings strongly support the contention that a second pathway exists for the formation of bioactive PGs in vivo that is independent of COX. This finding is of potential physiological and pharmacological importance because it would be predicted that the generation of PGs via this mechanism would not be inhibited by aspirin or other COX inhibitors. For purposes of discussion hereafter, PGs possessing a structure identical to those generated by COX are referred to PGE2 and PGD2. Compounds that are enantiomeric to COX-derived PGs are referred to as ent-PGE2 and ent-PGD2. The racemic mixtures are termed rac-PGE2 and rac-PGD2 (Fig. 3).

Epimerization of 15-E 2t -IsoP in Phosphate Buffer—15-E2t-IsoP (1 μm) was incubated in 50 mm KPO4 buffer, pH 7.4, for 0–24 h. Subsequently, fractions were analyzed for 15-E2t-IsoP, PGE2, 15-A2t-IsoP, and PGA2 by GC/MS and NMR as described (10Morrow J.D. Scruggs J. Chen Y. Zackert W.E. Roberts L.J. J.

Isolation of E/D-ring IsoPs and PGs from Rodent and Human Tissue and Urine—A mixture of E/D-ring IsoPs and PGs was isolated from the livers of Sprague-Dawley rats 2 h after intragastric administration of CCl4 (2 mg/kg) in corn oil (16Morrow J.D. Minton T.A. Mukundan C.R. Campbell M.D. Zackert W.E. Daniel V.C. Badr K.F. Blair I.A. Roberts L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4317-4326Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Chen Y.

The animals were anesthetized with pentobarbital (60 mg/kg) intraperitoneally and killed, and the livers were removed. Depending on the experiment, 1–4 g of tissue was immediately extracted to obtain a crude phospholipid extract containing IsoPs and PGs esterified in phospholipids. The lipid extract was then subjected to hydrolysis (30 min) in boronate buffer with A. mellifera venom containing phospholipase A2 as described (16Morrow J.D. Minton T.A. Mukundan C.R.

In control experiments, complete hydrolysis of 2-[3H7]arachidonylphosphatidylcholine was effected during this incubation. In addition, these hydrolysis conditions resulted in <5% epimerization of 15-E2t-IsoP to PGE2. Subsequently, free IsoPs and PGs were extracted, partially purified using C18 and silica Sep-Pak cartridges, and subjected to HPLC. For selected experiments, liver tissue was also obtained from day 19 COX-1–/–/COX-2–/– mouse pups harvested in utero as described (18Reese J. Paria B.C. Brown N. Zhao X. Morrow J.D. Dey S.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 9759-9764Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). In some experiments, 24-h urine samples were collected from rats treated with CCl4 or from normal humans. Unesterified IsoPs and PGs were extracted using Sep-Pak columns as described (6Morrow J.D. Hill K.E. Burk R.F. Nammour T.M. Badr K.F. Roberts L.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 9383-9387Crossref PubMed Scopus (1719) Google Scholar). HPLC Separation of Racemic E/D-ring PGs and IsoPs—Depending on the experiment, incubations of oxidized arachidonic acid, partially purified tissue extracts, or urine samples were analyzed for rac-PGE2, rac-PGD2,or rac-15-E2t-IsoP (9Morrow J.D. Minton T.A. Badr K.F. Roberts L.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1210: 244-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar, 10Morrow J.D. Scruggs J. Chen Y. Zackert W.E. Roberts L.J. J. Lipid Res. 1998; 39: 1589-1593Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To the biological sample was added ∼0.5–3 μCi of [3H7]PGE2, [3H7]PGD2, or 15-E2t-[3H6]IsoP. The mixture was then subjected to four successive HPLC purification steps. To maximize purification and resolution of each compound, we used HPLC procedures that yielded relatively long retention volumes for each compound (∼15–40 ml), and each solvent was run isocratically. In pilot experiments, it was also shown that the three compounds readily separated from one another under the HPLC conditions utilized. In addition, radiolabeled PGE2, PGD2, and 15-E2t-IsoP separated to a significant extent (1–2.5 ml) from unlabeled compounds due to the fact that the radiolabeled compounds contained either six or seven tritium atoms. Thus, for each HPLC step, fractions corresponding to those containing both labeled and unlabeled PGs or IsoPs were collected and pooled for further purification. For rac-PGE2 and rac-15-E2t-IsoP, the first HPLC step was normal-phase using a Econosil SI column (25 cm × 4.6 mm, 5-μm particles; Alltech Associates Inc., Deerfield, IL). The solvent system was 88:12:0.1 (v/v/v) hexane/isopropyl alcohol/acetic acid at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. The second HPLC step was reversed-phase using an Econosil C18 column (25 cm × 4.6 mm, 5 μm; Alltech Associates Inc.). The solvent system was 30:70:0.1 (v/v/v) acetonitrile/water/acetic acid at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. For the third and fourth HPLC steps, IsoPs or PGs were converted to PFB esters and rechromatographed on normal- and reversed-phase HPLC columns. A solvent system of 92:8 (v/v) hexane/isopropyl alcohol was used for the third HPLC step, and 51:49 (v/v) acetonitrile/water was used for the fourth HPLC step, both at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. For the purification of rac-PGD2, the same columns were utilized, but the solvent systems varied. For the first HPLC step, the solvent system was 93:7:0.1 (v/v/v) hexane/isopropyl alcohol/acetic acid; the second HPLC solvent system was 33:67:0.1 (v/v/v) acetonitrile/water/acetic acid; the third HPLC solvent system was 95:5 (v/v) hexane/isopropyl alcohol; and the fourth HPLC solvent system was 58:42 (v/v) acetonitrile/water. Chiral HPLC Separation of rac-PGE 2 and rac-PGD 2 —Racemic PGs purified by the methods described above were subsequently subjected to chiral HPLC to separate enantiomers using a Chiralpak AD column (25 cm × 4.6 mm, 5 μm; Chiral Technologies, Exton, PA). To separate rac-PGE2, a solvent system of 93:7 (v/v) hexane/isopropyl alcohol was utilized; and for rac-PGD2, a solvent system of 95:5 (v/v) hexane/isopropyl alcohol was employed. Analysis of PGs and IsoPs by GC/MS—Quantification of E/D-ring PGs and IsoPs in partially purified biological extracts and throughout subsequent HPLC purification procedures was performed by analyzing aliquots by selected ion monitoring GC/negative ion chemical ionization MS using either [2H4]PGE2 or [2H4]PGD2 as an internal standard. Compounds were quantified as O-methyloxime, PFB ester, trimethylsilyl ether derivatives by monitoring the M-PFB (M – 181) ions at m/z 524 for endogenous compounds and at m/z 528 for the deuterated standards (10Morrow J.D. Scruggs J. Chen Y. Zackert W.E. Roberts L.J. J. Lipid Res. 1998; 39: 1589-1593Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19DuBois R.N. Awad J. Morrow J. Roberts L.J. Bishop P.R. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 93: 493-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar). Epimerization of 15-E 2t -IsoP in Phosphate Buffer—We initially determined the extent to which 15-E2t-IsoP undergoes epimerization to PGE2 in a buffered solution at physiological pH (50 mm KPO4, pH 7.4). Products that were quantified included the starting material 15-E2t-IsoP and PGE2 and their respective dehydration products, 15-A2t-IsoP and PGA2. Amounts are expressed as percent of total PG at a particular time point. The identification of PGE2 was also confirmed by NMR comparison with a chemically pure PGE2 standard. The results are shown in Fig. 4. As shown, 15-E2t-IsoP epimerized in a time-dependent manner to PGE2. The half-life for this conversion under the conditions noted was ∼2 h. In addition, small amounts of 15-A2t-IsoP and PGA2 were formed, presumably as a result of dehydration of 15-E2t-IsoP and PGE2, respectively. These findings support the hypothesis that E2/D2-IsoPs can readily rearrange to E/D-ring PGs in aqueous environments. Analysis of E 2/D 2 -IsoPs from the Oxidation of Arachidonic Acid in Vitro and in Vivo— Fig. 5A shows the selected ion current chromatograms for E2/D2-IsoPs obtained from the analysis of arachidonic acid with iron/ADP/ascorbate for 2 h. Compounds were analyzed as O-methyloxime, PFB ester, trimethylsilyl ether derivatives. In the lower m/z 528 chromatogram are two peaks representing the syn- and anti-O-methyloxime isomers of the [2H4]PGE2 internal standard. In the upper m/z 524 chromatogram are a series of peaks representing various E2/D2-IsoPs. The peaks indicated by asterisks represent compounds that co-chromatographed upon GC with the O-methyloxime isomers of chemically synthesized PGE2. In addition, the peaks denoted by plus signs co-chromatographed with the O-methyloxime isomers of chemically pure PGD2. The total E2/D2-IsoPs present were ∼1500 ng/g of arachidonic acid. The materials designated by the peaks denoted by asterisks and plus signs each represent ∼20% of the total E2/D2-IsoPs in the mixture. In addition to the analysis of oxidized arachidonic acid in vitro, Fig. 5B shows the selected ion current chromatograms obtained from the hydrolysis of rat liver phospholipids after administration of CCl4 to animals to induce oxidant stress. As shown, a similar pattern of peaks was present as shown in Fig. 5A. The analyses in Fig. 5 (A and B) were performed on separate days, accounting for differences in GC retention time. Again, the peaks indicated by asterisks represent compounds that co-chromatographed upon GC with chemically synthesized PGE2, whereas those denoted by plus signs co-chromatographed with PGD2. The total E2/D2-IsoPs present in this sample were ∼400 ng/g of liver tissue. The materials designated by the peaks denoted by the asterisks and plus signs each represent ∼15–20% of the total E2/D2-IsoPs in the mixture. A very similar pattern of peaks representing E2/D2-IsoPs was obtained from the livers of both COX-1–/–/COX-2–/– and control fetal mice without induction of oxidant stress, although total E2/D2-IsoP levels were ∼5–10 ng/g of liver tissue (data not shown). In addition, a pattern of peaks virtually identical to those shown in the chromatograms in Fig. 5 was obtained after hydrolysis of rat liver phospholipids that had been treated with methyloxime HCl prior to hydrolysis. These latter findings suggest that epimerization of E2/D2-IsoPs occurs while compounds are esterified in phospholipids. Taken together, these data support the contention that significant amounts of compounds that coelute upon GC with PGE2 and PGD2 are generated from the peroxidation of arachidonic acid in vitro and in vivo. Purification of Putative rac-PGE 2 from Rat Liver Hydrolysates by HPLC—We subsequently sought to determine whether the compounds from rat liver hydrolysates that coeluted upon GC with PGE2 and PGD2 were, in fact, structurally identical to PGE2 and PGD2 and their respective enantiomers. If PGE2 and PGD2 are formed via the IsoP pathway, it would be predicted that they would be racemic mixtures because they would be formed from the epimerization of rac-15-E2t-IsoP and rac-15-D2c-IsoP, respectively (6Morrow J.D. Hill K.E. Burk R.F. Nammour T.M. Badr K.F. Roberts L.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 9383-9387Crossref PubMed Scopus (1719) Google Scholar, 7Morrow J.D. Chen Y. Brame C.J. Yang J. Sanchez S.C. Xu J. Zackert W.E. Awad J.A. Roberts L.J. Drug Metab. Rev. 1999; 31: 117-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Of note, enantiomers of PGE2 and PGD2 would not be expected to separate using standard non-chiral HPLC methods. The formation of rac-PGE2 was assessed initially. For these studies, ∼2000 ng of E2/D2-IsoPs from rat liver containing 3 μCi of [3H7]PGE2 was subjected to four successive HPLC purification steps. The first HPLC step was normal-phase using a solvent system of 88:12:0.1 (v/v/v) hexane/isopropyl alcohol/acetic acid. Aliquots of fractions that eluted from the HPLC column were then analyzed for E2/D2-IsoPs by GC/MS and for radioactivity (Fig. 6A). Radiolabeled PGE2 eluted in this system between 16 and 18.5 min. Compounds representing endogenous E2/D2-IsoPs were present that had the same retention time upon GC as PGE2, but that eluted with different retention volumes compared with PGE2 upon HPLC (10–12, 18–21, and 22.5–25 ml). Radiolabeled PGE2 eluted at a volume of ∼1.0–1.5 ml after unlabeled PGE2 using this HPLC solvent system. Significantly, as shown in Fig. 6A, an endogenous E2/D2-IsoP peak (indicated by the plus sign) was detected that coeluted with unlabeled PGE2, suggesting that this compound is endogenously derived rac-PGE2. The material that eluted from the HPLC column between 14.5 and 18.5 ml in Fig. 6A was subsequently subjected to reversed-phase HPLC using an isocratic solvent system of 30: 70:0.1 (v/v/v) acetonitrile/water/acetic acid. Aliquots of fractions collected were again analyzed for endogenous E2/D2-IsoPs by GC/MS and for radioactivity (Fig. 6B). Radiolabeled PGE2 eluted from the HPLC column with a retention volume of 28.5–32.5 ml. Analysis of aliquots of the eluted fractions by GC/MS showed that almost all of the unlabeled E2/D2-IsoP material detected in the chromatogram eluted at the retention volume of unlabeled PGE2 (29.5–33 ml), except for a small amount of additional material that eluted at 37–39 ml. Altering the polarity of a compound by derivatization and rechromatography of the compound can provide a powerful approach for purification and separation of biomolecules (9Morrow J.D. Minton T.A. Badr K.F. Roberts L.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1210: 244-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Thus, the material that eluted from the HPLC column between 28.5 and 33 ml in Fig. 6B was converted to a PFB ester and rechromatographed on a normal-phase HPLC column using a solvent system of 92:8 (v/v) hexane/isopropyl alcohol. Fig. 6C shows the result of this HPLC step. Radiolabeled PGE2 eluted between 29.5 and 33.5 ml. A large peak representing endogenous E2/D2-IsoPs that coeluted with the PFB ester of unlabeled PGE2 was detected (27.5–31.5 ml). Compounds that eluted from the HPLC column between 27.5 and 34 ml in Fig. 6C were then pooled. This material was subjected to further purification by reversed-phase HPLC using a solvent system of 51:49 (v/v) acetonitrile/water. The results of the analyses for radioactivity and endogenous E2/D2-IsoPs in the eluted fractions are shown in Fig. 6D. A single E2/D2-IsoP peak presumably representing rac-PGE2 was present that coeluted exactly with the PFB ester of unlabeled PGE2 (42–44.5 ml). Radiolabeled PGE2 eluted slightly before the endogenous E2/D2-IsoP compound. Virtually identical results were obtained when putative rac-PGE2 generated from arachidonic acid oxidized in vitro was analyzed by the HPLC protocols described above. Analysis of Endogenous Putative rac-PGE 2 by GC/MS—The material that eluted between 40.5 and 44.5 ml upon the fourth HPLC step was then analyzed by GC/MS. As shown in Fig. 7, two E2/D2-IsoP peaks were present in the m/z 524 chromatogram, representing the syn- and anti-O-methyloxime isomers of putative rac-PGE2. The amount of putative rac-PGE2 present in this rat liver hydrolysate was ∼35 ng/1000 ng of total E2/D2-IsoP based upon losses of [3H7]PGE2 that occurred with the four HPLC purification steps. When the material indicated by peaks in the m/z 524 chromatogram in Fig. 7 was mixed with an equivalent amount of derivatized synthetic PGE2, the two compounds co-chromatographed perfectly upon capillary GC without any suggestion of a shoulder on the GC peaks (data not shown). Additional experiments were subsequently undertaken to confirm the identification of the compound in Fig. 7 as PGE2. First, analysis of the material as a deuterated O-methyloxime derivative disclosed the presence of one carbonyl group. Second, analysis as a deuterated trimethylsilyl ether derivative revealed that the compound had two hydroxyl groups. Third, catalytic hydrogenation showed two double bonds (16Morrow J.D. Minton T.A. Mukundan C.R. Campbell M.D. Zackert W.E. Daniel V.C. Badr K.F. Blair I.A. Roberts L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4317-4326Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Finally, treatment of putative rac-PGE2 with 15% methanolic KOH for 30 min converted it to a compound with a molecular weight and retention time identical to those of PGB2 when analyzed by GC/MS (Fig. 8) (20Schneider C. Boeglin W.E. Brash A.R. Anal. Biochem. 2000; 287: 186-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Taken together, these findings strongly support the contention that the material represented in the m/z 524 chromatogram in Fig. 7 is rac-PGE2.Fig. 8Selected ion current chromatogram from the GC/MS analysis of putative rac-PGE2 in Fig. 7 afte"
https://openalex.org/W2049314466,"Human immunodeficiencey virus, type 1 (HIV-1) encodes three proteins, Nef, Vpu, and gp160, that down-modulate surface expression of the CD4 receptor during viral infection. In the present study, we have investigated the role of CD4 down-modulation in the HIV-1 infection cycle, primarily from the perspective of Vpu function. We report here that, like Nef, Vpu-mediated CD4 degradation modulates positively HIV-1 infectivity. Our data reveal that accumulation of CD4 at the cell surface of Vpu-deficient HIV-1-producing cells leads to an efficient recruitment of CD4 into virions and to an impairment of viral infectivity. This CD4-mediated inhibition of viral infectivity was not observed when a CD4 mutant unable to bind Env gp120 was used or when VSV-G glycoprotein was utilized to pseudotype viruses, suggesting that an interaction between CD4 and gp120 is required for interference. Indeed, protein analysis of Vpu-defective viral particles reveals that CD4 recruitment is associated with an increased formation of gp120-CD4 complexes at the virion surface. Interestingly, we did not detect any difference at the level of total virion-associated Env glycoproteins between wild-type and Vpu-defective virus, indicating that accumulation of CD4 at the cell surface and recruitment of CD4 into Vpu-defective HIV-1 particles exert a negative effect on viral infectivity, most likely by promoting the formation of nonfunctional gp120-CD4 complexes at the virion surface. Finally, we show that both Vpu- and Nef-induced CD4 down-modulation activities are required for production of fully infectious particles in CD4+ T cell lines and primary cells, an observation that has clear implications for viral spread in vivo. Human immunodeficiencey virus, type 1 (HIV-1) encodes three proteins, Nef, Vpu, and gp160, that down-modulate surface expression of the CD4 receptor during viral infection. In the present study, we have investigated the role of CD4 down-modulation in the HIV-1 infection cycle, primarily from the perspective of Vpu function. We report here that, like Nef, Vpu-mediated CD4 degradation modulates positively HIV-1 infectivity. Our data reveal that accumulation of CD4 at the cell surface of Vpu-deficient HIV-1-producing cells leads to an efficient recruitment of CD4 into virions and to an impairment of viral infectivity. This CD4-mediated inhibition of viral infectivity was not observed when a CD4 mutant unable to bind Env gp120 was used or when VSV-G glycoprotein was utilized to pseudotype viruses, suggesting that an interaction between CD4 and gp120 is required for interference. Indeed, protein analysis of Vpu-defective viral particles reveals that CD4 recruitment is associated with an increased formation of gp120-CD4 complexes at the virion surface. Interestingly, we did not detect any difference at the level of total virion-associated Env glycoproteins between wild-type and Vpu-defective virus, indicating that accumulation of CD4 at the cell surface and recruitment of CD4 into Vpu-defective HIV-1 particles exert a negative effect on viral infectivity, most likely by promoting the formation of nonfunctional gp120-CD4 complexes at the virion surface. Finally, we show that both Vpu- and Nef-induced CD4 down-modulation activities are required for production of fully infectious particles in CD4+ T cell lines and primary cells, an observation that has clear implications for viral spread in vivo. CD4 is a type 1 integral membrane glycoprotein expressed primarily on the surface of thymocytes, helper T lymphocytes, and, to a lesser extent, on cells of the monocyte/macrophage lineage (1Miceli M.C. Parnes J.R. Adv. Immunol. 1993; 53: 59-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Besides its role in T cell ontogeny and antigen-specific T-cell activation, CD4 also serves as the primary cellular co-receptor for human immunodeficiency virus, type 1 (HIV-1) 1The abbreviations used are: HIV-1, human immunodeficiency virus 1; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; RT, reverse transcriptase; VSV-G, vesicular stomatitis virus glycoprotein-G; PBMC, peripheral blood mononuclear cell; FCS, fetal calf serum; LTR, long terminal repeat; MAGI, multinuclear activation of β-galactosidase infectivity; FACS, fluorescence-activated cell sorting.1The abbreviations used are: HIV-1, human immunodeficiency virus 1; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; RT, reverse transcriptase; VSV-G, vesicular stomatitis virus glycoprotein-G; PBMC, peripheral blood mononuclear cell; FCS, fetal calf serum; LTR, long terminal repeat; MAGI, multinuclear activation of β-galactosidase infectivity; FACS, fluorescence-activated cell sorting. viral entry into cells (1Miceli M.C. Parnes J.R. Adv. Immunol. 1993; 53: 59-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Infection of target cells is initiated by the high affinity interaction (<10 nm) occurring between CD4 and the viral envelope glycoprotein gp120 (2Moore J.P. AIDS. 1990; 4: 297-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Although the CD4 receptor plays a critical role during HIV-1 entry into target cells, it is well established that HIV-1 down-modulates its own receptor at later stages of the infection cycle in productively infected cells. Indeed, HIV-1 encodes three proteins, Vpu, Env, and Nef, that have a profound effect on CD4 catabolism and are involved in the removal of CD4 from the surface of infected cells (3Cullen B.R. Cell. 1998; 93: 685-692Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar, 4Doms R.W. Trono D. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2677-2688Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). Early in infection, the Nef protein down-regulates CD4 molecules that are already present at the cell surface by accelerating their endocytosis and subsequent degradation in lysosomes (5Aiken C. Konner J. Landau N.R. Lenburg M.E. Trono D. Cell. 1994; 76: 853-864Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (604) Google Scholar, 6Chen B.K. Gandhi R.T. Baltimore D. J.

Virol. 1995; 69: 528-533Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). At later stages of infection, the envelope gp160 precursor, through its high receptor binding affinity, retains newly synthesized CD4 in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). These gp160-CD4 complexes not only prevent cell surface expression of CD4 but also block gp160 maturation and trafficking (10Crise B. Buonocore L. Rose J.K. J. Virol. 1990; 64: 5585-5593Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11Kawamura I. Koga Y. Oh-Hori N. Onodera K. Kimura G. Nomoto K. J. Virol. 1989; 63: 3748-3754Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12Stevenson M. Meier C. Mann A. Chapman N. Wasiak A. Cell. 1988; 53: 483-496Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). The accessory Vpu (viral protein U) regulates the half-life of CD4 molecules complexed to gp160 by selectively inducing their degradation in the ER, thus, presumably, releasing gp160 and permitting its maturation, trafficking, and incorporation into progeny virions (13Willey R.L. Maldarelli F. Martin M.A. Strebel K. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 226-234Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Vpu is an 81-amino acid protein unique to HIV-1 and the closely related simian immunodeficiency virus isolated from chimpanzee (SIVcpz) (14Cohen E.A. Terwilliger E.F. Sodroski J.G. Haseltine W.A. Nature. 1988; 334: 532-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar, 15Huet T. Cheynier R. Meyerhans A. Roelants G. Wain-Hobson S. Nature. 1990; 345: 356-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). The vpu gene product is a phosphorylated oligomeric type 1 integral membrane protein that is translated from a bicistronic mRNA that also encodes the Env glycoproteins (16Schwartz S. Felber B.K. Fenyö E.-M. Pavlakis G.N. J. Virol. 1990; 64: 5448-5456Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Vpu performs two main functions during the viral life cycle; it enhances the release of virions from infected cells, and it mediates the selective degradation of the CD4 receptor in the ER (17Strebel K. Klimkait T. Maldarelli F. Martin M.A. J. Virol. 1989; 63: 3784-3791Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18Terwilliger E.F. Cohen E.A. Lu Y.-C. Sodroski J.G. Haseltine W.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 5163-5167Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar, 19Willey R.L. Maldarelli F. Martin M.A. Strebel K. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 7193-7200Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Vpu-mediated CD4 degradation is a multistep process that is triggered by the direct physical binding of Vpu to the cytoplasmic tail of CD4 (20Bour S. Schubert U. Strebel K. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 1510-1520Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Mutational studies have revealed that phosphorylation of seryl residues at positions 52 and 56 of Vpu is required to initiate CD4 proteolysis but is not essential for the initial binding of the protein to CD4 (20Bour S. Schubert U. Strebel K. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 1510-1520Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Using genetic and biochemical assays, Margottin et al. have shown that Vpu connects CD4 to the ubiquitin-proteasome degradative pathway through a direct, phosphoserine-dependent interaction with the F box protein β-TrCP (21Margottin F. Bour S.P. Durand H. Selig L. Bénichou S. Richard V. Thomas D. Strebel D. Benarous R. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 565-574Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (566) Google Scholar). This finding, combined with the demonstrated sensitivity of Vpu-mediated CD4 degradation to proteasome inhibitors, strongly suggests that Vpu targets CD4 to proteolysis by recruiting the ubiquitin-proteasome cytosolic machinery (22Schubert U. Anton L.C. Bacik I. Cox J.H. Bour S. Bennink J.R. Orlowski M. Strebel K. Yewdell J.W. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 2280-2288Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although recent studies have provided new details on the molecular mechanism underlying the down-modulation of the CD4 receptor, it is still unclear why HIV-1 has evolved multiple mechanisms to remove its receptor from the cell surface. Given such functional convergence, it is tempting to speculate that cell surface CD4 regulation must be an important determinant of viral replication and pathogenesis in vivo. Indeed, recent reports have shown that down-regulation of cell surface CD4 by Nef and/or Vpu is important for viral spread (23Bour S. Perrin C. Strebel K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33800-33806Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 24Cortes M. Wong-Staal F. Wong-Staal J.L. J. Biol.

Biol. 1999; 9: 613-621Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). All of these studies show that high levels of CD4 on the cell surface interfere with the production of infectious HIV-1 particles; however, they propose different mechanisms to account for this inhibition. Ross et al. showed that overexpression of CD4 in HIV-1-transfected human embryonic kidney cells (293T) leads to a reduction in the overall amounts of virus released but does not affect the absolute infectivity of released virus (26Ross T.M. Oran A.E. Cullen B.R. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 613-621Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). This study further reported that this CD4-mediated inhibition of viral release is dependent on the specific interaction between CD4 and the viral envelope glycoproteins and is reversed by Nef expression (26Ross T.M. Oran A.E. Cullen B.R. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 613-621Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). On the basis of these results, Ross et al. (26Ross T.M. Oran A.E. Cullen B.R. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 613-621Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar) proposed that cell surface CD4 interacts with the envelope protein present on budding HIV-1 virions to inhibit viral release. More recently, Bour et al. (23Bour S. Perrin C. Strebel K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33800-33806Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) reported that maintenance of CD4 surface expression in HIV-1-transfected HeLa cells inhibited HIV-1 particle release in an Env-independent manner. The finding that CD4 had no significant effect on particle release by a Vpu-deficient virus led these authors to suggest that CD4 acts by inhibiting the particle release-promoting activity of Vpu (23Bour S. Perrin C. Strebel K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33800-33806Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). However, the infectivity of the released particles was not analyzed in this study. In contrast to the latter studies, Lama et al. (25Lama J. Mangasarian A. Trono D. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 622-631Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar) found that expression of high levels of CD4 at the cell surface of 293T cells induced a drastic reduction in the infectivity of released virion by the sequestration of the viral envelope by CD4. Protein analysis of virions released from 293T cells transfected with proviral constructs isogenic except for the expression of Nef or/and Vpu revealed that CD4 could accumulate in viral particles while at the same time blocking incorporation of Env into virions (25Lama J. Mangasarian A. Trono D. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 622-631Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). More recently, Cortes et al. (24Cortes M. Wong-Staal F. Wong-Staal J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 1770-1779Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) extended these studies to Jurkat T cell lines and found that physiological levels of surface CD4 interfere in an envelope-dependent manner with the infectivity of released HIV-1 particles. In the present study, we have investigated the role of CD4 down-modulation in the virus life cycle, primarily from the perspective of Vpu function. We report here that Vpu, like Nef, exerts a positive effect on HIV-1 infectivity by down-regulating cell surface CD4. The effect of Vpu on viral infectivity correlates with the protein's ability to degrade CD4 in the ER and with levels of CD4 surface expression in virus-producing cells. Interestingly, accumulation of CD4 at the cell surface of Vpu-deficient HIV-1 producing cells was found to lead to efficient recruitment of CD4 into virions while at the same time promoting the formation of nonfunctional gp120-CD4 complexes at the virion surface. Finally, both Vpu and Nef were found to be required for production of fully infectious HIV-1 particles in CD4+ T cell lines and in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), thus suggesting that these accessory proteins, through their ability to down-regulate CD4, are therefore likely to facilitate the spread of HIV-1 in vivo. Cell Lines—Human SV40-transformed 293-T fibroblasts and HeLa-CD4-LTR-β-gal cells (27Kimpton J. Emerman M. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 2232-2239Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS) and 1% antibiotics (penicillin and streptomycin) (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium plus 10% FCS). The human lymphoid T cell lines MT4, Jurkat low-CD4, and 1G5 were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% FCS and 1% antibiotics (RPMI plus 10% FCS). Jurkat CD4– and Jurkat high-CD4 cell lines were maintained in RPMI plus 10% FCS containing Geneticin (500 μg/ml) or Geneticin (500 μg/ml) and zeocin (50 μg/ml) (Invitrogen), respectively, as described (24Cortes M. Wong-Staal F. Wong-Staal J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 1770-1779Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The CD4+ 1G5 indicator cell line is derived from Jurkat cells and expresses a luciferase reporter gene under the control of the HIV-1 long terminal repeat (LTR) (28Aguilar-Cordova E. Chinen J. Donehower L. Lewis D.E. Belmont J.W. AIDS Res. Hum. Retroviruses. 1994; 10: 295-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were isolated from volunteers by Ficoll-Paque centrifugation as recommended by the manufacturer (Amersham Biosciences) and washed thoroughly with PBS to remove platelets. Cells were then cultured in the presence of phytohemagglutinin (5 μg/ml) for 72 h to activate lymphocytes. Following activation, cells were washed with complete media to remove lectins and maintained in RPMI plus 10% FCS supplemented with 20 units/ml interleukin-2 (Roche Applied Science). All cells were cultured at 37 °C under a 5% CO2 atmosphere. Plasmid Constructs and Antibodies—SVCMV-CD4, SVCMV-CD4Δ32, the CD4– control SVCMVexPA, and SVCMV-VSV-G plasmid constructs were described previously (29Yao X.-J. Mouland A.J. Subbramanian R.A. Forget J. Rougeau J. Bergeron D. Cohen E.A. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 4712-4720Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The SVCMV-CD4ΔCDR2 plasmid, which encodes a CD4 mutant that contains a 7-amino acid deletion (amino acids 43–49) in the CDR2 region, was obtained by cloning the HindIII-BamHI fragment of pMNC-CD4ΔCDR2 (30Fleury S. Lamarre D. Meloche S. Ryu S.E. Cantin C. Hendrickson W.A. Sékaly R.P. Cell. 1991; 66: 1037-1049Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar) into pGEM-7Zf– (Promega). The XbaI-BamHI fragment of pGEM-7Zf-CD4ΔCDR2 was then inserted into the XbaI-BglII cloning sites of SVCMVexPA expression vector to generate SVCMV-CD4ΔCDR2. The proviral HxBH10-vpu +/vpu –/vpu52/56 constructs were described previously (31Friborg J. Ladha A. Göttlinger H. Haseltine W.A. Cohen E.A. J. Acquired Immune Defic. Syndr. 1995; 8: 10-22Google Scholar). The genotype of these constructs is 5′-LTR-gag +, pol +, vif +, vpr –, tat +, rev +, vpu +/–, env +, nef – -LTR-3′. The pNL4.3 infectious molecular clone was obtained from the AIDS Research and Reference Reagent Program (32Adachi A. Gendelman H.E. Koenig S. Folks T. Willey R. Rabson A. Martin M.A. J. Virol. 1986; 59: 284-291Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This provirus encodes all HIV-1 accessory proteins. The pNL4.3-nef – proviral construct was described previously (33Gratton S. Yao X.J. Venkatesan S. Cohen E.A. Sekaly R.P. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 3305-3311PubMed Google Scholar). The isogenic pNL4.3-vpu +/–/nef +/– proviral constructs were obtained by replacing the SalI-BamHI (nucleotide positions 5785 and 8465, respectively, where +1 is the site of transcription initiation) fragments of pNL4.3-nef +/– with the corresponding SalI-BamHI fragment of HxBH10-vpu +/–. The anti-CD4 (OKT4) and anti-p24 monoclonal antibodies were derived from ascitic fluids of Balb/c mice that were injected with the OKT4 or p24 hybridoma (catalog nos. ATCC CRL-8002 and ATCC HB9725, respectively; American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA). Rabbit anti-CD4 H-370 polyclonal antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA) (catalog no. sc-7219). The anti-HIV-1 serum (162) was obtained from an HIV-1 infected individual whose serum was tested positive for the presence of HIV-1 antibodies by ELISA. Finally, the anti-gp41 monoclonal antibodies were obtained from supernatant of cultured Chessie 8 hybridoma cells (34Abacioglu Y. Fouts T. Laman J. Claassen E. Pincus S. Moore J. Roby C. Kamin-Lewis R. Lewis G. AIDS Res. Hum. Retroviruses. 1994; 10: 371-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). The anti-gp120 mouse monoclonal antibody (1D6) (35Dickey C. Ziegner U. Agadjanyan M. Srikantan V. Refaeli Y. Prabhu A. Sato A. Williams W. Weiner D. Ugen K. DNA Cell Biol. 2000; 19: 243-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar) and Chessie 8 hybridoma cells were both obtained from the AIDS research and reference reagent program. Virus Stock Production—HXBH10-vpu +/vpu – and VSV-G-pseudotyped virus stocks were produced by transfecting 5 × 106 293T cells with 5 μg of proviral DNA constructs alone or, in the case of pseudotyping, with 10 μg of proviral DNA constructs and 10 μg of SVCMV-VSV-G DNA by the calcium-phosphate method (29Yao X.-J. Mouland A.J. Subbramanian R.A. Forget J. Rougeau J. Bergeron D. Cohen E.A. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 4712-4720Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). 48–72 h post-transfection, supernatants were collected, clarified by centrifugation at 3,000 rpm for 30 min, and filtered through 0.45-μm membrane filters. Virions were then sedimented onto a 20% sucrose cushion by ultracentrifugation at 45,000 rpm in a 50.4 rotor type (Beckman) for 2 h at 4 °C. Viral production was then evaluated by performing a standard reverse transcriptase (RT) activity assay in 50 μl as described previously (31Friborg J. Ladha A. Göttlinger H. Haseltine W.A. Cohen E.A. J. Acquired Immune Defic. Syndr. 1995; 8: 10-22Google Scholar). Transient Transfections—For the infectivity assays, 293T cells (106) were mock-transfected or co-transfected with 5 μg of proviral DNA constructs (HXBH10-vpu +, HXBH10-vpu –, HxBH10-vpu52/56) and 5 μg of CD4-expressing plasmids (SVCMV-CD4, SVCMV-CD4Δ32, or CD4-ΔCDR2). DNA concentration was normalized in each sample by the addition of the SVCMVexPA control plasmid. pNL4.3-vpu +/–/nef +/– virus preparations were produced by transfecting 10 μg of the corresponding proviral DNA constructs in 2 × 106 MT4 cells using the DEAE-dextran method (31Friborg J. Ladha A. Göttlinger H. Haseltine W.A. Cohen E.A. J. Acquired Immune Defic. Syndr. 1995; 8: 10-22Google Scholar). Culture supernatants were collected 48–72 h post-transfection as described above for viral production. Flow Cytometry Analysis—Jurkat T cell lines or transfected 293T cells were washed, harvested in PBS containing 5% FCS, and incubated with OKT4 anti-CD4 monoclonal antibody in 5% FCS-PBS. After 30 min at 4 °C, cells were washed twice in PBS and incubated for another 30 min at 4 °C with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-mouse antibody in 5% FCS-PBS. Cells were then washed twice in PBS and analyzed by flow cytometry on a FACSCalibur® cytometer (Becton Dickinson). As negative control, cells were stained using fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-mouse antibody only (Becton Dickinson). Replication Studies and Viral Infections—MT4 cells (106) or PBMCs (3 × 106) were infected with equivalent amounts of virus (HxBH10-vpu +/vpu –) as determined by RT activity (MT4, 2 × 105 cpm of RT; PBMC, 7.5 × 106 cpm of RT). Following a 4-h adsorption period, cells were washed extensively with PBS and resuspended in 10 ml of RPMI plus 10% FCS. At regular time intervals, cells were recovered by centrifugation and seeded in fresh medium at a concentration between 106 and 5 × 105 viable cells/ml. Cell supernatants were analyzed for the presence of virus by performing RT assays as described previously (31Friborg J. Ladha A. Göttlinger H. Haseltine W.A. Cohen E.A. J. Acquired Immune Defic. Syndr. 1995; 8: 10-22Google Scholar). Jurkat T cell lines (CD4–, low-CD4, or high-CD4) (3 × 106) were infected with equivalent amounts (3 × 107 cpm of RT) of VSV-G-pseudotyped HxBH10-vpu + /vpu – virus. Following a 4-h adsorption period, cells were washed extensively with PBS and resuspended in 10 ml of RPMI plus 10% FCS. The infectivity of virions released in the supernatant was analyzed 48 h postinfection. Infectivity Assays—Infectivity of virus present in clarified supernatants was assessed using the multinuclear activation of β-galactosidase infectivity (MAGI) assay (27Kimpton J. Emerman M. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 2232-2239Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) or the luciferase infectivity assay (28Aguilar-Cordova E. Chinen J. Donehower L. Lewis D.E. Belmont J.W. AIDS Res. Hum. Retroviruses. 1994; 10: 295-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Briefly, for the MAGI assay, equal amounts of virus (6 × 105 to 6 × 106 cpm of RT) was used to infect HeLa-CD4-LTR-β-gal cells seeded the previous day in 24-well plates at 3 × 104 cells/well. 48 h postinfection, cells were washed, fixed, and stained as described (27Kimpton J. Emerman M. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 2232-2239Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The number of β-galactosidase-positive blue cells was determined using light microscopy. Each sample was analyzed in duplicate. For the luciferase assay, equal amounts of virus (1–5 × 106 cpm of RT) was used to infect 2 × 105 1G5 cells (LTR-luciferase indicator cell line). Immediately after adsorption, cells were thoroughly washed, and neutralizing amounts of anti-CD4 and anti-gp120 antibodies were added to cell supernatant to prevent syncytia formation. 24 h postinfection, AZT was added to a final concentration of 10 μm to limit viral production to one infection cycle. 48 h postinfection, cells were harvested and lysed, and a luciferase assay was performed according to the manufacturer's recommendation (Promega). Western Blot and Co-immunoprecipitation—Supernatants from HIV-1-transfected MT4 cells or from HIV-1/CD4 co-transfected 293T cells were collected and clarified by centrifugation at 3000 rpm. Virions were pelleted from cell-free supernatants by ultracentrifugation onto a 20% sucrose cushion as described above and lysed in radioimmune precipitation buffer (140 mm NaCl, 8 mm Na2HPO4, 2 mm NaH2PO4, 1.2 mm deoxycholic acid sodium salt, 0.5% SDS, and 1% Nonidet P-40). Similar amounts of virion, normalized by RT activity measurements, were lysed, divided in two equal fractions, and immunoprecipitated using either anti-CD4 (OKT4) monoclonal antibodies or anti-HIV-1 serum (162). Immune complexes were precipitated using protein A-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences), washed extensively, resuspended in reducing sample buffer, and separated by 8 or 12.5% SDS-PAGE. Following electrophoresis, viral proteins were transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane (0.45-μm pore size; Bio-Rad) by electroblotting for 3 h at 30 V in a Bio-Rad Trans Blot Cell. The membrane was then incubated for1hin blocking solution buffer (Tris-buffered saline containing 1% Tween 20 and 5% nonfat dry milk) and incubated for 2 h with either rabbit anti-CD4 (1:500 dilution) or monoclonal antibodies directed against gp120 (1:1000 dilution) or p24 (1:4000 dilution). Bound antibodies were then probed with horseradish peroxidase-linked anti-mouse or anti-rabbit immunoglobulin (used at 1:7500), washed extensively, and revealed using a sensitive enhanced chemiluminescence detection system (ECL detection kit; Amersham Biosciences). For detection of virion-associated gp41 levels, serial dilution of virion lysates were directly separated by PAGE and analyzed by Western blot as described above using monoclonal antibodies directed against gp41 (undiluted culture fluid supernatant). Vpu-mediated CD4 Degradation Alleviates the Negative Effect of Cell Surface CD4 on Viral Infectivity—Given that Nef-mediated CD4 down-modulation was previously reported to be an important regulator of HIV-1 infection cycle (24Cortes M. Wong-Staal F. Wong-Staal J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 1770-1779Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 25Lama J. Mangasarian A. Trono D. Curr.

HxBH10-vpu + or HxBH10-vpu – isogenic virions were produced in 293T cells following co-transfection of the corresponding proviral construct with increasing concentrations of SVCMV-CD4. These proviral constructs are derived from HxBc2 and as such contain a premature stop codon in Nef (36Ratner L. Haseltine W. Patarca R. Livak K.J. Starcich B. Josephs S.F. Doran E.R. Rafalski JA.

As previously reported, the expression of Vpu was found to down-regulate CD4 expression at the cell surface as revealed by FACS analysis (Fig. 1A) (19Willey R.L. Maldarelli F. Martin M.A. Strebel K. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 7193-7200Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The infectivity potential of Vpu– and Vpu+ HIV-1 virus produced in each cell culture was then evaluated by MAGI assay using equivalent amounts of virus as measured by reverse transcriptase activity. The results of Fig. 1B clearly show that CD4 expression exerted an inhibitory effect on HIV-1 infectivity that was directly proportional to cell surface CD4 expression levels. Interestingly, the negative effect of CD4 on viral infectivity was more pronounced (2–7-fold) with Vpu-defective HIV virus than with Vpu+ virus. In contrast, the infectivity potential of Vpu+ and Vpu– viruses produced from CD4– 293T cells was found to be similar (Fig. 1, C and D). To further confirm the infectivity data obtained using the MAGI assay, we tested the infectivity of Vpu+ or Vpu– virus produced in mock- or CD4-transfected 293 T cells using the 1G5 indicator (luciferase) CD4+ T cell line. As shown in Fig. 1C, we found that the infectivity potential of Vpu+ and Vpu– virus produced in CD4– cells was almost identical, whereas it differed substantially when viruses were produced in the presence of CD4. In the latter case, Vpu-defective virus displayed a"

We explored novel signaling pathways mediating IL-17 induction of the cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) gene in human chondrocytes, synovial fibroblasts, and macrophages. In preliminary work, recombinant human (rh) IL-17 stimulated a rapid (5–15 min), substantial (>8-fold), and sustained (>24 h) increase in COX-2 mRNA, protein, and prostaglandin E2 release. Screening experiments with cell-permeable kinase inhibitors (e.g. SB202190 and p38 inhibitor), Western analysis using specific anti-phospho-antibodies to a variety of mitogen-activated protein kinase cascade intermediates, co-transfection studies using chimeric cytomegalovirus-driven constructs of GAL4 DNA-binding domains fused to the transactivation domains of transcription factors together with Gal-4 binding element-luciferase reporters, ectopic overexpression of activated protein kinase expression plasmids (e.g. MKK3/6), or transfection experiments with wild-type and mutant COX-2 promoter constructs revealed that rhIL-17 induction of the COX-2 gene was mediated exclusively by the stress-activated protein kinase 2/p38 cascade. A rhIL-17-dependent transcriptional pulse (1.76 ± 0.11-fold induction) was initiated by ATF-2/CREB-1 transactivation through the ATF/CRE enhancer site in the proximal promoter. However, steady-state levels of rhIL-17-induced COX-2 mRNA declined rapidly (<2 h) to control levels under wash-out conditions. Adding rhIL-17 to transcriptionally arrested cells stabilized COX-2 mRNA for up to 6 h, a process compromised by SB202190. Deletion analysis using transfected chimeric luciferase-COX-2 mRNA 3′-untranslated region reporter constructs revealed that rhIL-17 increased reporter gene mRNA stability and protein synthesis via distal regions (–545 to –1414 bases) of the 3′-untranslated region. This response was mediated entirely by the stress-activated protein kinase 2/p38 cascade. As such, IL-17 can exert direct transcriptional and post-transcriptional control over target proinflammatory cytokines and oncogenes.

Thus, IL-17 stimulates tissue damage and cartilage degradation (joint failure) directly or indirectly by recruiting activated inflammatory cells (e.g. neutrophils via adhesion molecules) and inducing the synthesis of proinflammatory cytokines in the inflamed tissue. The effector cascades mediating the proinflammatory actions of IL-17 are currently under study, and although the IL-17 receptor (IL-17R) is a type I transmembrane protein (130 kDa) with no intrinsic kinase activity (23Yao Z.

Using the same cell and culture conditions, IL-17 stimulated macrophagic release of IL-1β, TNF-α, and IL-6 was related to rapid calcium flux and a more delayed increase in NF-κB DNA binding (14Jovanovic D.V.

In the present study, we examined the IL-17-dependent signaling events using as a paradigm the IL-17 induction of COX-2 gene in human synovial fibroblasts, chondrocytes, and, where indicated, macrophages. The COX-2 protein represents the rate-limiting step in the activated biosynthesis of prostanoids, the latter playing a cardinal role as pleiotropic immune and inflammatory modulators (28DeWitt D.L.

We report that the magnitude and duration of the induction of COX-2 mRNA, COX-2 protein, and PGE2 release by rhIL-17 is primarily the result of IL-17-dependent stabilization of COX-2 mRNA, although transcriptional mechanisms are also involved in the initial phase of induction. Essentially, rhIL-17 mitigates COX-2 mRNA decay normally mediated by the 3′-UTR of COX-2 mRNA. Finally, we provide evidence that the transcriptional and stabilization processes involve a restricted MAPK profile, the MKK3/6/SAPK2/p38 cascade.

Preparation of Cell Extracts and Western Blotting—50–100 μg of cellular protein extracted in RIPA buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml each of aprotinin, leupeptin, and pepstatin, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, and 1 mm NaF) or hot SDS-PAGE loading buffer, from control and treated cells, were subjected to SDS-PAGE through 10% gels (final concentration of acrylamide, 16 × 20 cm) under reducing conditions and transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes (Amersham Biosciences). Following blocking with 5% BLOTTO for 2 h at room temperature and washing, the membranes were incubated overnight at 4 °C with polyclonal anti-human COX-2 (Cayman Chemical Co., Ann Arbor, MI; 1:7500 dilution) in TTBS containing 0.25% BLOTTO. The second anti-rabbit antibody-horseradish peroxidase conjugate (1:10,000 dilution) was subsequently incubated with membranes for 1 h at room temperature, washed extensively for 30–40 min with TTBS, and then rinsed with Tris-buffered saline at room temperature. Following incubation with an ECL chemiluminescence reagent (Amersham Biosciences), the membranes were prepared for autoradiography, exposed to Kodak (Rochester, NY) X-Omat film, and subjected to a digital imaging system (Alpha G-Imager 2000; Canberra Packard Canada, Mississauga, Canada) for semi-quantitative measurements. In addition to the anti-COX-2 and COX-1 (Cayman) antisera, the following polyclonal antibodies were used (New England Biolabs Ltd., Mississauga, ON, Canada): total (independent of phosphorylation state) and anti-phospho-p38 MAPK (Thr180/Tyr182), anti-phospho-MKK3/6 (Ser189/207), total and anti-phospho-IκB-α (Ser32), anti-phospho-ATF-2 (Thr69/71), anti-phospho-CREB-1 (Ser133), anti-phospho-c-Jun (Ser63), anti-phospho-JNK/SAPK (Thr183/Tyr185), anti-phospho-Mnk1 (Thr197/201), total and anti-phospho-eIF4E (Ser209), total and anti-phospho-p44/42 (Thr202/Tyr204), and total and anti-phospho-STAT3 (Ser727). Northern Blot Analysis of mRNA—Total cellular RNA was isolated (1 × 106 cells = 10–20 μg of RNA) using the Trizol (Invitrogen) reagent. Generally, 5 μg of total RNA were resolved on 1.2% agarose-formaldehyde gel and transferred electrophoretically (30 V overnight at 4 °C) to Hybond-N™ nylon membranes (Amersham Biosciences) in 0.5× Tris/acetate/EDTA buffer, pH 7. After prehybridization for 24 h, the hybridizations were carried out at 50–55 °C for 24–36 h, followed by high stringency washing at 68 °C in 0.1× SSC, 0.1% SDS. The following probes, labeled with digoxigenin-dUTP by random priming, were used for hybridization: human COX-2 cDNA (1.8 kb; Cayman Chemical Co.) initially cloned into the EcoRV site of pcDNA 1 (Invitrogen) that was released by PstI and XhoI digestion resulting in a 1.2-kb cDNA fragment and a 780-bp PstI/XbaI fragment from GAPDH cDNA (1.2 kb; American Type Culture Collection, Rockville, MD) that was initially cloned into a PstI of pBR322 vector. This latter probe served as a control of RNA loading because GAPDH is constitutively expressed in cells used in these experiments. All of the blots were subjected to a digital imaging system (Alpha G-Imager 2000; Canberra Packard Canada) for semi-quantitative measurements, and changes in COX-2 expression were always considered as a ratio, COX-2/GAPDH mRNA. Transfection Experiments—Transient transfection experiments were conducted in 4-, 6-, or 12-well cluster plates as previously described (34Faour W.H. He Y. He Q.W. de Ladurantaye M. Quintero M.

Transfections were conducted using the FuGENE 6™ (Roche Applied Science) or LipofectAMINE 2000™ reagents (Invitrogen) method for 6 h according to the manufacturers' protocol with cells at around 30–40% confluence. The cells were re-exposed to a culture medium with 1% FCS for 2 h prior to the addition of the biological effectors. Transfection efficiencies were controlled in all experiments by co-transfection with 0.5 μg of pCMV-β-gal, a β-galactosidase reporter vector under the control of CMV promoter (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). A COX-2 promoter (–2390 to + 34)-LUC plasmid was kindly provided by Dr. Stephen Prescott (University of Utah) (39Kutchera W. Jones D.A. Matsunami N. Groden J. McIntyre T.M. Zimmerman G.A. White R.L. Prescott S.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 4816-4820Crossref PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar), and site-directed mutagenesis was performed with the Bsu36I COX-2 promoter fragment (–415 to + 34) using the QuikChange™ (Stratagene) kit and involved modifying the ATF-CRE site at bp –53/–54 (CA → TC) and the NF-κB site at bp–215/–216 (CC → GG). Chimeric luciferase reporter plasmids fused with the human COX-2 mRNA 3′-UTR (1451 bp), AU-rich elements (429 bp of which the first 116 bp contain an AU-cluster), the 3′-UTR minus the AU-rich element cluster, or a construct completely devoid of the COX-2 3′-UTR but containing the SV40 poly(A) signal (40Dixon D.A.

The plasmids are designated LUC-3′-UTR, LUC-+ARE, LUC-ΔARE, LUC-Δ3′-UTR, respectively, and were a kind gift of Dr. D. Dixon (University of Utah). In our signal transduction pathway reporting systems (Stratagene), a reporter plasmid containing the 17-bp (5×) GAL4 DNA-binding element (UAS) fused to a TATA box upstream from the luciferase gene (pFR-LUC) was co-transfected with a construct containing the transactivation domains of transcription factors (e.g. ATF-2 and c-Jun) fused to GAL4 DNA-binding domain and driven by a CMV promoter (e.g. pFA-ATF-2). In addition, plasmids (Stratagene) harboring NF-κB or interferon-stimulated response element enhancer elements (5×) fused to a TATA box upstream from the luciferase gene were used to assess transactivation processes activation by IL-17 in the cell phenotypes tested. Finally, wild-type and activated MKK3/6 expression plasmids (Stratagene) were overexpressed to determine the role on COX-2 expression. The luciferase values, expressed as enhanced relative light units, were measured in a Lumat LB 9507 luminometer (EG&G, Stuttgart, Germany) and normalized to the level of β-galactosidase activity (optical density at 450 nm after 24 h of incubation) and cellular protein (bicinchoninic acid procedure; Pierce). RT-PCR for Luciferase and GAPDH—The oligonucleotide primers for PCR were prepared with the aid of a DNA synthesizer (Cyclone Model, Biosearch Inc., Montreal, Canada) and used at a final concentration of 200 nmol/liter. The sequences for the Luciferase primers were as follows: 5′-ACGGATTACCAGGGATTTCAGTC-3′ and 5′-AGGCTCCTCAGAAACAGCTCTTC-3′ (antisense) for the luciferase fragment of 367 bp (40Dixon D.A. Kaplan C.D. McIntyre T.M. Zimmerman G.A. Prescott S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 11750-11757Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). The sequences for the GAPDH (which served as a standard of quantitation) primers were 5′-CAGAACATCATCCCTGCCTCT-3′, which corresponds to position 604–624 bp of the published sequence, and 5′-GCTTGACAAAGTGGTCGTTGAG-3′, from positions 901–922 bp, for an amplified product of 318 bp (36Di Battista J.A.

Recently, the anti-angiogenic activities of apo(a) have been demonstrated both <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i>. However, its effects on tumor angiogenesis and the underlying mechanisms involved have not been fully elucidated. To evaluate the anti-angiogenic and anti-tumor activities of the apo(a) kringle domains and to elucidate their mechanism of action, we expressed the last three kringle domains of apo(a), KIV-9, KIV-10, and KV, in <i>Escherichia coli</i>. The resultant recombinant protein, termed rhLK68, exhibited a dose-dependent inhibition of basic fibroblast growth factor-stimulated human umbilical vein endothelial cell proliferation and migration <i>in vitro</i> and inhibited the neovascularization in chick chorioallantoic membranes <i>in vivo</i>. The ability of rhLK68 to abrogate the activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinases appears to be responsible for rhLK68-mediated anti-angiogenesis. Furthermore, systemic administration of rhLK68 suppressed human lung (A549) and colon (HCT-15) tumor growth in nude mice. Immunohistochemical examination and <i>in situ</i> hybridization analysis of the tumors showed a significant decrease in the number of blood vessels and the reduced expression of vascular endothelial growth factor, basic fibroblast growth factor, and angiogenin, indicating that suppression of angiogenesis may have played a significant role in the inhibition of tumor growth. Collectively, these results suggest that a truncated apo(a), rhLK68, is a potent anti-angiogenic and anti-tumor molecule."
https://openalex.org/W1983647080,"Type I diabetes is an autoimmune disease that results in destructive depletion of the insulin-producing beta cells in the islets of Langerhans in pancreas. With the knowledge that hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) is a potent survival factor for a wide variety of cells, we hypothesized that supplementation of HGF may provide a novel strategy for protecting pancreatic beta cells from destructive death and for preserving insulin production. In this study, we demonstrate that expression of the exogenous HGF gene preserved insulin excretion and mitigated hyperglycemia of diabetic mice induced by streptozotocin. Blood glucose levels were significantly reduced in mice receiving a single intravenous injection of naked HGF gene at various time points after streptozotocin administration. Consistently, HGF concomitantly increased serum insulin levels in diabetic mice. Immunohistochemical staining revealed a marked preservation of insulin-producing beta cells by HGF in the pancreatic islets of the diabetic mice. This beneficial effect of HGF was apparently mediated by both protection of beta cells from death and promotion of their proliferation. Delivery of HGF gene in vivo induced pro-survival Akt kinase activation and Bcl-xL expression in the pancreatic islets of diabetic mice.

Diabetes is a devastating illness with significant morbidity and mortality, and its incidence has increased steadily worldwide (1Harris M.I. Diabetes Care. 1998; 21: C11-C14Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Type I diabetes is an autoimmune disease that results in extensive destruction of the insulin-producing beta cells in the islets of Langerhans in pancreas. Current clinical therapy for type I diabetes is to replace insulin through multiple injections, or replace the destroyed beta cell mass via islet or whole pancreas transplantation (2Shapiro A.M.

However, these approaches have their inherent limitations. For instance, injections at best only produce fluctuated, dysregulated levels of circulating insulin. Likewise, the shortage of human islets precludes the clinical use of islet transplantation on a large patient population. In addition, it remains a question whether the transplanted beta cells can survive for a long duration, in light of the continuous presence of the autoimmune triggers responsible for initial destruction of beta cells. In this context, we hypothesized that protecting pancreatic beta cells from destructive death may represent a new, novel strategy for preserving insulin production and for prevention and treatment of type I diabetes.

Michalopoulos G.K. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 1177-1180Crossref PubMed Scopus (552) Google Scholar, 13Liu Y. Curr. Opin. Nephrol.

Earlier studies demonstrated that HGF and its specific receptor, a receptor tyrosine kinase encoded by c-met protooncogene, are highly expressed during pancreas development. HGF is also shown to function as an insulinotropic factor and promotes beta cell proliferation and regeneration (15Otonkoski T. Beattie G.M. Rubin J.S. Lopez A.D. Baird A. Hayek A. Diabetes. 1994; 43: 947-953Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 16Otonkoski T. Cirulli V. Beattie M. Mally M.I. Soto G. Rubin J.S. Hayek A.

Transgenic mice overexpressing HGF in the islet beta cell resist the diabetogenic effects of the beta cell toxin streptozotocin (STZ) (18Garcia-Ocana A. Takane K.K. Syed M.A. Philbrick W.M.

Lopez-Talavera J.C. Stewart A.F. Diabetes. 2001; 50: 2752-2762Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Furthermore, intraperitoneal injection of HGF protein exhibits a favorable effect for amelioration of hyperglycemia in diabetic mice receiving a marginal mass of islet grafts (20Nakano M. Yasunami Y. Maki T. Kodama S. Ikehara Y. Nakamura T. Tanaka M. Ikeda S. Transplantation. 2000; 69: 214-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Collectively, these observations led us to speculate that HGF might play a critical role in promoting insulin-producing beta cell survival after injurious stimuli; if so, delivery of HGF may provide an effective means for preserving insulin excretion and for mitigating hyperglycemia in diabetes in vivo. Earlier studies show that exogenous HGF protein has a very short half-life in blood circulation, presumably owing to its rapid clearance by the liver in vivo (21Liu M.L. Mars W.M. Zarnegar R. Michalopoulos G.K. Am. J. Pathol. 1994; 144: 129-140PubMed Google Scholar, 22Zioncheck T.F. Richardson L. DeGuzman G.G. Modi N.B. Hansen S.E. Godowski P.J. Endocrinology. 1994; 134: 1879-1887Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Thus, it is tremendously difficult to sustain circulating levels of exogenous HGF protein through direct injection, even at very short intervals. This problem may be potentially solved, at least partially, by developing an HGF gene transfer strategy that allows persistent expression in vivo. To this end, we recently described an efficient approach to introduce exogenous HGF gene in vivo by systemic administration of a naked plasmid vector. This hydrodynamics-based in vivo gene transfer strategy results in a high level of exogenous HGF protein in the circulation. Hence, this approach could provide an efficient way to examine the potential of exogenous HGF on preservation of beta cells in the pancreatic islets of diabetic animals. In the present study, we report the effects of exogenous HGF on the development of diabetes in a mouse model induced by STZ. Our results suggest that exogenous HGF promotes beta cell survival and proliferation and, thereby, mitigates hyperglycemia in STZ-induced diabetic mice. Animals—Male CD-1 mice weighing 18–22 g were purchased from Harlan Sprague-Dawley (Indianapolis, IN). They were housed in the animal facilities of the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center with free access to food and water. Animals were treated humanely in accordance with National Institutes of Health guidelines and by use of approved procedures of the Institutional Animal Use and Care Committee at the University of Pittsburgh. Plasmid Injection—The recombinant human HGF expression plasmid (pCMV-HGF) that contains full-length human HGF cDNA driven under a human cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter was cloned as described previously (23Liu Y. Centracchio J.N. Lin L. Sun A.M. Dworkin L.D. Exp. Cell Res. 1998; 242: 174-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The empty expression plasmid vector pcDNA3 was purchased from Invitrogen (Carlsbad, CA). Plasmid DNA was administrated into mice by a hydrodynamic-based gene transfer technique via rapid injection of a large volume of DNA solution through the tail vein, as previously described (24Liu F. Song Y. Liu D. Gene Ther. 1999; 6: 1258-1266Crossref PubMed Scopus (1472) Google Scholar, 25Yang J. Chen S. Huang L. Michalopoulos G.K. Liu Y. Hepatology. 2001; 33: 848-859Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 26Dai C. Yang J. Liu Y. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2002; 13: 411-422Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, 20 μg of plasmid DNA was diluted in 1.6 ml of saline and injected via the tail vein into the circulation within 5–10 s. Mice were injected with pCMV-HGF plasmid at 16 h prior to administration of STZ (Sigma, St. Louis, MO). Control mice were injected with 20 μg of empty vector pcDNA3 plasmid in an identical manner. STZ was given by a single intravenous injection at the dose of 100 mg/kg body weight (BW), unless indicated otherwise. Groups of mice (n = 6) were sacrificed at 7 days after administration of STZ, respectively, and the pancreas was removed. For some experiments, additional groups of mice were sacrificed at 6, 12, 24, and 48 h after administration of STZ, respectively. One part of the pancreas was fixed in 10% phosphate-buffered formalin for histological studies after paraffin embedding. Another part was immediately frozen in optimal cutting temperature compound for cryosectioning. Blood Glucose Measurement—Blood was collected at 1, 3, and 7 days after administration of STZ by retro-orbital bleeding. Blood glucose levels were determined by using a colorimetric glucose assay kit, according the procedures specified by the manufacturer (Sigma). Determination of Insulin Level—Mouse serum insulin levels were determined by using an ultrasensitive insulin enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kit (Crystal Chem Inc., Chicago, IL). Briefly, serum samples were collected at 1, 3, and 7 days after administration of STZ. Five-microliter samples or different concentrations of mouse insulin standard solutions and 95 μl of sample diluents were added to the 96-well microtiter plates pre-coated with the guinea pig anti-rat insulin antibody. After incubating for 2 h at 4 °C and followed by extensive washing, a 100-μl aliquot of horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rat insulin antibody was added, and the plates were incubated for 30 min at room temperature. Following washing, they were then incubated with 100 μl of enzyme substrate solution. The plates were allowed to stand for 40 min at room temperature, and the reaction was stopped by addition of enzyme reaction stopping solution. The absorbance was read at 405 nm by an EL800 Universal Microplate Reader (Bio-Tek Instruments, Inc., Winooski, VT). The concentration of serum insulin was expressed as nanograms per milliliter. For determination of the insulin content in pancreatic islets, isolated islets were resuspended in acid/ethanol (0.18 m HCl in 70% ethanol), sonicated, and extracted at -20 °C, as described previously (27Garcia-Ocana A.

After neutralization, the insulin content in the islet extracts was determined by using the same ELISA kit. The data were expressed as nanograms per microgram of total protein. Immunofluorescence Staining—Indirect immunofluorescence staining was performed using an established procedure (14Yang J. Liu Y. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2002; 13: 96-107Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 28Yang J. Shultz R.W. Mars W.M. Wegner R.E. Li Y. Dai C. Nejak K. Liu Y. J. Clin. Invest. 2002; 110: 1525-1538Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). Briefly, pancreatic cryosections were prepared and mounted onto poly l-lysine-coated slides and fixed in 3% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 30 min, followed by incubation with 0.2% Triton X-100 for 15 min. The slides were stained with the specific primary antibodies using the Vector M.O.M. immunodetection kit according to the protocols specified by the manufacturer (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA). The primary antibodies used were monoclonal mouse insulin antibody (Clone 2D11-H5, Ventana Medical Systems Inc., Tucson, AZ) and a mixture of polyclonal rabbit anti-glucagon (A0565, alpha cell marker), anti-somatostatin (A0566, delta cell marker), and anti-pancreatic polypeptide (A0619, PP cell marker) antibodies (Dako, Carpenteria, CA). To visualize the primary antibodies, tissues were stained with either Cy-3™ or fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated secondary antibodies (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories). The slides were then stained with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole, HCl (DAPI) to visualize the nuclei. Stained slides were mounted with anti-fade mounting medium (Vector Laboratories) and viewed with a Nikon Eclipse E600 Epi-fluorescence microscope equipped with a Nikon DXM 200 digital camera (Melville, NY). For quantitation, the percentages of a particular cell type in the pancreatic islets were calculated, which were determined on at least five islets per animal, six animals per group. Immunohistochemical Staining—Pancreatic sections from the mice were prepared at 4 μm thick by a routine procedure. Sections were deparaffinized and rehydrated through a graded series of alcohol to distilled H2O. Endogenous peroxidase was blocked in a solution of 3% H2O2 in methanol for 10 min at room temperature. Double immunohistochemical staining was performed using the M.O.M. immunodetection kit according to the instructions specified by the manufacturer (Vector Laboratories). The slides were first stained with monoclonal mouse insulin antibody (Clone 2D11-H5, Ventana Medical Systems Inc.) or a mixture of polyclonal rabbit anti-glucagon, anti-somatostatin, and anti-pancreatic polypeptide antibodies, followed by incubating with their respective secondary antibodies. For visualizing proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), the slides were reincubated with anti-PCNA antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnologies, Santa Cruz, CA). As a negative control, the primary antibody was replaced with nonimmune mouse IgG, and no staining occurred. Slides were viewed with a Nikon Eclipse E600 microscope equipped with a Nikon DXM200 digital camera (Melville, NY). The percentages of PCNA-positive cells in the pancreatic islets were calculated, which were determined on at least five islets per animal, six animals per group. TUNEL Staining—In situ detection of DNA fragmentation was performed using terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT)-mediated dUTP nick-end labeling (TUNEL) staining, according to the procedure described previously (26Dai C. Yang J. Liu Y. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2002; 13: 411-422Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 29Dai C. Yang J. Liu Y. J. Biol.

A fluorescein-based TUNEL staining protocol was employed by using an Apoptosis Detection System (Promega, Madison, WI). Cryosections of the pancreas were washed with PBS, fixed with 3% paraformaldehyde, and then treated with 0.2% Triton X-100 for 10 min. After pre-equilibration in 100 μl of buffer containing 200 mm potassium cacodylate, 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.6, 0.2 mm dithiothreitol, 0.25 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 2.5 mm cobalt chloride, strands of DNA were end-labeled by incubation at 37 °C for 1 h in 50 μm fluorescein-12-dUTP, 100 μm dATP, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 1 mm EDTA, and TdT. The reaction was stopped by adding 2× sodium chloride/sodium citrate hybridization buffer for 15 min. To localize the pancreatic islets, immunofluorescence staining was performed on cryosections with anti-insulin antibody, as described elsewhere (14Yang J. Liu Y. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2002; 13: 96-107Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For visualizing cell nuclei, the slides were also stained with DAPI. After washing, the slides were mounted with Vectashield anti-fade mounting media (Vector Laboratories) and observed on Nikon Eclipse E600 Epi-fluorescence microscope. The apoptotic index in the pancreatic islets was defined as a percentage of apoptotic cells in total islet cell population, which were determined on at least five islets per animal, six animals per group. Isolation of Pancreatic Islets—Mouse pancreatic islets were isolated by collagenase digestion followed by separation on Ficoll-Conray gradients, according to the procedure described previously (19Garcia-Ocana A. Vasavada R.C. Cebrian A. Reddy V. Takane K.K. Lopez-Talavera J.C. Stewart A.F. Diabetes. 2001; 50: 2752-2762Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Briefly, the pancreas was injected through the pancreatic duct with 3 ml of 1.7 mg/ml collagenase (Sigma) in Hanks' buffered saline solution (HBSS), removed, incubated at 37 °C for 20 min, and then passed through a 500-μm wire nylon mesh. The digested pancreas was rinsed with HBSS, and the islets were separated by density gradient in the Ficoll-Conray device (Sigma). After several washes with HBSS, islets were picked manually using a Pasteur pipette with the aid of a dissecting microscope and pooled for protein extraction. Western Blot Analysis—The isolated pancreatic islets as described above were homogenized in radioimmune precipitation assay lysis buffer (1% Nonidet P-40, 0.1% SDS, 100 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, 2 μg/ml antipain, and 2 μg/ml leupeptin in PBS) on ice, and the supernatants were collected after centrifugation at 13,000 × g at 4 °C for 20 min. Protein concentration was determined using a bicinchoninic acid protein assay kit (Sigma), and islet lysates were mixed with an equal amount 2× SDS loading buffer (100 mm Tris-HCl, 4% SDS, 20% glycerol, and 0.2% bromphenol blue). Samples were heated at 100 °C for 5–10 min before loading and separated on pre-casted 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA). The proteins were electro-transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane (Amersham Biosciences, Piscataway, NJ) in transfer buffer containing 48 mm Tris-HCl, 39 mm glycine, 0.037% SDS, and 20% methanol at 4 °C for 1 h. Nonspecific binding to the membrane was blocked for 1 h at room temperature with 5% Carnation nonfat milk in TBS buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, and 0.1% Tween 20). The membranes were then incubated for 16 h at 4 °C with various primary antibodies in blocking buffer containing 5% milk. The antibodies against phospho-specific Akt kinase and total Akt were obtained from Cell Signaling (Beverly, MA). The antibodies against Bcl-xL and actin were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. Following extensive washing for three times, the membranes were then incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (Bio-Rad) for 1 h at room temperature in 5% nonfat milk. The signals were visualized by the enhanced chemiluminescence system (ECL, Amersham Biosciences). Immunoprecipitation—Immunoprecipitation was carried out essentially according to the procedures described previously (30Zhang X. Li Y. Dai C. Yang J. Mundel P. Liu Y. Am. J. Physiol. 2003; 284: F82-F94Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Briefly, pancreatic islets isolated from various groups were homogenized in radioimmune precipitation assay lysis buffer (1% Nonidet P-40, 0.1% SDS, 100 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, 2 μg/ml antipain, and 2 μg/ml leupeptin in PBS) on ice, and the supernatants were collected after centrifugation at 13,000 × g at 4 °C for 20 min. After protein concentration was determined, 200 μg of the lysates was precleared by adding 0.25 μg of normal rabbit IgG and 20 μl of protein A/G Plus-agarose (Santa Cruz Biotechnologies) into 1 ml of whole islet lysates. After incubation for 1 h at 4 °C, supernatants were collected by centrifugation at 1,000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C. Lysates were immunoprecipitated overnight at 4 °C with 1 μg of anti-mouse c-Met (Santa Cruz Biotechnologies) and anti-phosphotyrosine-PY20 (BD PharMingen/Transduction Laboratories, San Diego, CA), respectively, followed by precipitation with 20 μl of protein A/G Plus-agarose for 3 h at 4 °C. After four washes with radioimmune precipitation assay buffer, the immunoprecipitates were boiled for 5 min in SDS sample buffer. The resulting precipitated complexes were separated on SDS-polyacrylamide gels and blotted with various antibodies as described above. Statistical Analysis—Animals were randomly assigned to control and treatment groups. Data were expressed as mean ± S.E. Data were analyzed using SigmaStat software (Jandel Scientific, San Rafael, CA). Comparison between groups was made using one-way analysis of variance followed by the Student-Newman-Keuls test. A p value of less than 0.05 was considered significant. HGF Mitigates Hyperglycemia and Preserves Insulin Production in Streptozotocin-induced Diabetic Mice—Mice were administrated intravenously with HGF plasmid at 16 h prior to injection of a specific diabetogenic agent, STZ. As previously reported (25Yang J. Chen S. Huang L. Michalopoulos G.K. Liu Y. Hepatology. 2001; 33: 848-859Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), following a single, intravenous injection of naked plasmid encoding human HGF cDNA driven under a cytomegalovirus promoter (pCMV-HGF), serum HGF levels increased as early as 4 h, reaching a peak at 12 h. Quantitative determination by a specific ELISA for human HGF protein revealed ∼8 ng/ml exogenous HGF in the circulation at the peak level (data not shown). Although serum HGF levels tended to decline, significant HGF protein (more than 1 ng/ml) was detectable in the circulation at 7 days after a single injection. Blood glucose levels at different time points in mice after STZ injection are presented in Fig. 1A. We found that HGF significantly mitigated the STZ-induced hyperglycemia in diabetic mice. In mice injected with empty pcDNA3 vector, blood glucose levels started to elevate as early as 1 day and continued to increase to more than 300 mg/dl at 7 days after intravenous administration of STZ at 100 mg/kg BW. The dynamics of hyperglycemia observed in this study manifested the onset and development of diabetes in mice, presumably due to the destruction and depletion of beta cells in the islet of Langerhans in pancreas, as typically seen in this model. However, in mice given pCMV-HGF plasmid, blood glucose levels at various time points were significantly reduced, compared with the pcDNA3 control group (Fig. 1A). This reduction of blood glucose levels by HGF was reproducible in the diabetic mice induced by different doses of STZ (Fig. 1C), indicating that delivery of HGF gene substantially mitigates the hyperglycemia in diabetic animals. We next examined the serum insulin levels in the STZ-induced diabetic mice. As shown in Fig. 1B, during the course of the development of diabetes induced by STZ, serum insulin levels progressively declined and reached to ∼20% of normal level at 7 days after injection of STZ at 100 mg/kg BW. The reduction of serum insulin levels was closely correlated with an increase in blood glucose levels (Fig. 1A). Single injection of HGF gene significantly improved serum insulin levels at various time points in the diabetic mice induced by STZ. At 7 days, serum insulin levels in mice receiving HGF plasmid injection were more than 3-fold of that receiving empty vector (Fig. 1B). Consistently, HGF also increased serum insulin levels in the diabetic mice induced by various doses of STZ (Fig. 1D). HGF Preserves Insulin-producing Beta Cells in Mouse Pancreas—The beneficial effects of exogenous HGF described above prompted us to further investigate the impacts of exogenous HGF on the survival and preservation of insulin-producing beta cells in the islets of pancreas in diabetic mice. To distinguish the beta cells from non-beta cells in the islets, we employed a double immunofluorescence staining technique. Beta cells were stained with anti-insulin antibody (red), whereas non-beta islet cells were recognized by a mixture of antibodies against glucagon (alpha cell marker), somatostatin (delta cell marker), and pancreatic polypeptide (PP cell marker) (green). Fig. 2 shows representative micrographs of the pancreatic islets of diabetic mice at different time points after STZ administration. In mice injected with STZ at 100 mg/kg BW, the numbers of insulin-positive beta cells in the pancreatic islets dropped very rapidly. At 48 h after STZ, very few, if any, islet cells with positive staining with insulin were observed in mice receiving empty pcDNA3 vector injection (Fig. 2C). Of note, there was a significant number of cells that were not stained with either insulin (red) or non-beta islet cell markers (green) within the islets after STZ. Such cells are presumably the degranulated beta cells caused by severe hyperglycemia. It is of interest to note that, owing to marked depletion of beta cells after STZ, non-beta islet cells (green) apparently aggregated in the center of the islets where beta cells normally were positioned (Fig. 2, C and D). Delivery of HGF gene significantly mitigated the depletion of the beta cells in diabetic mice. Substantial numbers of insulin-positive beta cells was still present at 7 days after STZ in mice receiving pCMV-HGF plasmid injection (Fig. 2H). Fig. 2I shows the percentage of beta cells in the pancreatic islets at different time points after STZ between pcDNA3 and pCMV-HGF groups. At 7 days after injection of STZ at 100 mg/kg BW, the percentage of beta cells in the pancreatic islets dropped below 20%; most of them, if not all, were insulin-negative, degranulated beta cells. However, in mice receiving pCMV-HGF injection, about 60% of the total cell population within the islets was beta cells, and most of them displayed insulin positivity (Fig. 2, H and I). Consistent with these observations, we found a marked difference in the insulin content in the isolated islets at 7 days after STZ between pcDNA3 and pCMV-HGF groups (Fig. 2J), as determined by a quantitative measurement using specific ELISA. HGF Protects Beta Cells from Death in Diabetic Mice Induced by STZ—We further investigated the cellular events that led to an increase in insulin-positive beta cells in STZ-induced diabetic mice by HGF. Because STZ is a diabetogenic agent that specifically induce"

Site-directed spin labeling was done at eight matching sites in each of two recombinant murine MBPs, qC1 (charge +19) and qC8 charge (+13), which, respectively, emulate the native form of the protein (C1) and a post-translationally modified form (C8) that is increased in multiple sclerosis. When interacting with large unilamellar vesicles, most spin-labeled sites in qC8 were more mobile than those in qC1. Depth measurement via continuous wave power saturation indicated that the N-terminal and C-terminal sites in qC1 were located below the plane of the phospholipid headgroups. In qC8, the C-terminal domain dissociated from the membrane, suggesting a means by which the exposure of natural C8 to cytosolic enzymes and ligands might increase in vivo in multiple sclerosis. The importance of two Phe-Phe pairs in MBP to its interactions with lipids was investigated by separately mutating each pair to Ala-Ala. The mobility at F42A/F43A and especially F86A/F87A increased significantly.

A major function of MBP is to bind to the apposing cytoplasmic faces of the myelin membrane and maintain compaction for efficient nerve transmission (1Readhead C. Takasashi N. Shine H.D. Saavedra R.

Neurochem. 1992; 59: 1589-1608Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), but it may also be involved in signal transduction (3Dyer C.A. Philibotte T.M. Wolf M.K. Billings-Gagliardi S. J. Neurosci. Res. 1994; 39: 97-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Because of a diversity of post-translational modifications, MBP exists as a number of charge isomers denoted C1–C8 with a net positive charge decreasing from +19 to +13 at pH 7.0 (4Wood D.D. Moscarello M.A. Russell W. The Molecular Biology of Multiple Sclerosis. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1997: 37-54Google Scholar, 5Moscarello M.A. Juurlink B.H.J. Devon R.M. Doucette A.J.

Li M.X. Jin X. Lubman D. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 2441-2449Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The C8 component is characterized by the enzymatic deimination of arginine to citrulline. Each conversion results in the loss of one positive charge, and C8 is thus the least basic form of the protein and has a diminished ability to cause adhesion of lipid bilayers (7Bates I.R. Libich D.S. Wood D.D. Moscarello M.A. Harauz G. Protein Expression Purif. 2002; 25: 330-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 8Boggs J.M. Yip P.M. Rangaraj G. Jo E.

Component C8 occurs in greater amounts in patients with the demyelinating disease, multiple sclerosis (9Wood D.D. Moscarello M.A. J. Biol.

Invest. 1994; 94: 146-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). We have previously produced and characterized a recombinant murine 18.5-kDa MBP (11Bates I.R. Matharu P. Ishiyama N. Rochon D. Wood D.D. Polverini E. Moscarello M.A. Viner N.J. Harauz G. Protein Expression Purif. 2000; 20: 285-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Here, we will denote this protein quasi-C1 (qC1), because it is unmodified post-translationally (with the exception of an LEH6 tag) and emulates the least-modified, most basic charge isomer C1. We have also generated by site-directed mutagenesis a quasi-deiminated form of recombinant murine 18.5-kDa MBP that we call qC8, since it was designed to mimic the less cationic natural form C8. The recombinant qC8 consists of Arg/Lys → Gln substitutions at the same deimination sites in human MBP that predominate in chronic multiple sclerosis and has properties similar to those of natural C8 (7Bates I.R. Libich D.S. Wood D.D. Moscarello M.A. Harauz G. Protein Expression Purif. 2002; 25: 330-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The net charge of qC1 is +19 at neutral pH, whereas that of qC8 is +13 as for their natural counterparts. In this study, we investigated the electrostatic and hydrophobic components of MBP-lipid interactions by site-directed spin labeling (SDSL) of MBP and electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy (12Hubbell W.L. Cafiso D.S. Altenbach C. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 735-739Crossref PubMed Scopus (717) Google Scholar, 13Hubbell W.L. Gross A. Langen R. Lietzow M.A. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1998; 8: 649-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar). The technique of SDSL involves replacement of residues at selected sites by cysteines, which are then labeled with a methanethiosulfonate spin label that can be probed by EPR spectroscopy. This approach enabled us to monitor the electrostatic lipid interaction profiles of qC1 and qC8 at numerous specific sites. The importance of hydrophobic interactions was evaluated by spin-labeling sites adjacent to each of the two Phe-Phe pairs and determining the effects of Phe-Phe → Ala-Ala substitution on spin label mobility and accessibility to lipid-soluble O2 and water-soluble nickel ethylenediaminediacetic acid (NiEDDA) as applied by Victor et al. (14Victor K. Jacob J. Cafiso D.S. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 12527-12536Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) to the myristoylated alanine-rich C kinase substrate effector region. The technique of SDSL is particularly well suited to MBP, because there are no native cysteinyl residues to be removed prior to mutagenesis and because the EPR spectrum is not affected by light diffraction and immobilization associated with MBP-induced lipid vesicle aggregation. Lipid vesicle aggregation is a powerful mimic of the in vivo function of MBP in the myelin sheath (15Jo E. Boggs J.M. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 13705-13716Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 16Surewicz W.K. Epand R.M. Epand R.F. Hallett F.R. Moscarello M.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1986; 863: 45-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), and SDSL/EPR offers the advantage of studying residue-specific interactions within this natural environment. Materials—The sulfhydryl reactive spin label [1-oxyl-2,2,5,5-tetramethyl-d-pyrroline-3-methyl]methanethiosulfonate (MTS-SL) was purchased from Toronto Research Chemicals (Toronto, Ontario, Canada). This spin label is referred to as R1 in previously published literature (17Mchaourab H.S. Lietzow M.A. Hideg K. Hubbell W.L. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 7692-7704Crossref PubMed Scopus (525) Google Scholar, 18Victor K. Cafiso D.S. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 3402-3410Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The paramagnetic reagent NiEDDA was synthesized as previously described (19Oh K.J. Altenbach C. Collier R.J. Hubbell W.L. Methods Mol. Biol. 2000; 145: 147-169PubMed Google Scholar). All of the other chemicals were of reagent grade and were acquired from either Fisher Scientific or Sigma. The Ni2+-NTA-agarose beads were obtained from Qiagen (Mississauga, Ontario, Canada). Phosphatidylcholine (PC), phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylserine (PS), phosphatidylinositol, cholesterol, and sphingomyelin were procured from Avanti Polar Lipids (Alabaster, AL). The depth calibration curve was obtained using the following spin-labeled lipids purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids: 1-palmitoyl-2-stearoyl(n-doxyl)-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine with n = 5, 7, 10, and 12 (5-doxyl-PC, 7-doxyl-PC, 10-doxyl-PC, and 12-doxyl-PC) and 1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphotempocholine with TEMPO (1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phospho(TEMPO)choline bound to the quaternary ammonium group (TEMPO-PC). All of the lipids were dissolved in chloroform (100%) at concentrations of 5–10 mg/ml. Site-directed Mutagenesis of qC1 and qC8 —The quasi-deiminated mutant of MBP (qC8) was generated from qC1 by sequential site-directed mutations (first R25Q followed by R33Q, K119Q, R127Q, and R157Q and finally R168Q, murine sequence numbering) using the QuikChange protocol (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) as described previously (7Bates I.R. Libich D.S. Wood D.D. Moscarello M.A. Harauz G. Protein Expression Purif. 2002; 25: 330-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). A series of matching Cys substitutions in each of qC1 and qC8 was generated for SDSL. In addition, in qC1, each of the two Phe-Phe pairs was separately replaced by Ala-Ala. In summary (Fig. 1a), the following mutations were generated in qC1: S17C, S44C, S67C, H85C, S99C, S129C, S159C, F42A/F43A/S44C, and F86A/F87A/H85C. The following mutations were generated in qC8: S17C, S44C, S67C, H85C, S99C, S129C, and S159C. The introduced cysteinyl residues could then be spin-labeled by MTS-SL (R1) (Fig. 1b). Labeling and Purification of Cysteine-containing Mutants of qC1 and qC8 —The purification and spin labeling of recombinant murine 18.5-kDa MBPs were done using a modification of a published purification protocol (11Bates I.R. Matharu P. Ishiyama N. Rochon D. Wood D.D. Polverini E. Moscarello M.A. Viner N.J. Harauz G. Protein Expression Purif. 2000; 20: 285-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Two types of lysis buffer were used, one containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 6 m urea, 5 mm imidazole, and 500 mm NaCl, and the other being identical with the exception of the addition of 1 mm dithiothreitol to prevent the formation of intermolecular disulfide bonds. The cell pellet was lysed using the dithiothreitol-containing buffer, and subsequent loading and washing of the Ni2+-NTA column were done using this buffer. Finally, the column was washed with normal lysis buffer using 25 column volumes to remove the excess dithiothreitol. An additional 25 volumes of spin labeling buffer with urea (20 mm HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.4, 6 m urea, 10 mm NaCl) were then run through the column. The agarose beads were removed from the column and resuspended in 8 ml of spin labeling buffer, and a 10-fold molar excess of MTS-SL was dissolved in 100 μl of Me2SO was added to the bead slurry. The slurry consisting of the protein bound to the Ni2+-NTA beads and MTS-SL was incubated on a nutator overnight in a 15-ml Falcon tube at room temperature. The column was repoured the next day and washed with normal lysis buffer to remove excess MTS-SL, and the bound protein was eluted. The purity of each labeled protein was verified using SDS-PAGE, and the protein-containing fractions were dialyzed against 20 mm HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.4, 10 mm NaCl, and 1 mm EDTA. The labeling efficiency was assessed for one sample using electrospray ionization mass spectroscopy (11Bates I.R. Matharu P. Ishiyama N. Rochon D. Wood D.D. Polverini E. Moscarello M.A. Viner N.J.

Moscarello M.A. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 5374-5381Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar) and was found to be complete (data not shown). The protein concentration was estimated by measuring the absorbance at 280 nm using the published extinction coefficients (7Bates I.R. Libich D.S. Wood D.D. Moscarello M.A. Harauz G. Protein Expression Purif. 2002; 25: 330-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The protein samples were adjusted to 1 mg/ml in the same buffer for EPR spectroscopy. Preparation of Large Unilamellar Vesicles (LUVs)—Aliquots of the chloroform solutions of the lipids were combined in the following molar ratios to form LUVs with a lipid composition similar to that estimated for the cytoplasmic face of the myelin membrane (Cyt-LUVs): 44 mol % cholesterol; 27 mol % phosphatidylethanolamine; 13 mol % PS; 11 mol % PC; 3 mol % sphingomyelin; and 2 mol % phosphatidylinositol (15Jo E. Boggs J.M. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 13705-13716Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 21Inouye H. Kirschner D.A. Biophys. J. 1988; 53: 247-260Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). The solvent was evaporated under a stream of nitrogen, and the lipid mixture was dried further in a vacuum dessicator overnight. It was hydrated in 20 mm HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.4, 10 mm NaCl, and 1 mm EDTA. The lipid suspension was then passed through a 100-nm polycarbonate membrane 17 times using a syringe extruder (Avanti Polar Lipids). The final lipid concentration after extrusion was verified using a phosphorous assay (22Chen P.S. Toribara T.Y. Warner H. Anal. Chem. 1956; 28: 1756-1758Crossref Scopus (5807) Google Scholar). EPR Spectroscopy—For signal-averaged EPR spectroscopy, spin-labeled qC1 and qC8 solutions were added to LUVs at a concentration of 100 μg of protein to 2 mg of LUVs, yielding a molar protein:lipid ratio of 1:600. This value is a little less than the MBP:lipid ratio in myelin. Borosilicate glass 50-μl capillary tubes (Fisher Scientific) were used to hold the samples. Aggregation of the vesicles by MBP occurred immediately, and after 10 min, the preparations were spun at 1000 × g to loosely pellet the MBP-LUVs. Most of the supernatant was removed, and the pellets were taken up in capillary tubes. The opposite end of the capillary tube was sealed using a Bunsen burner, and the tubes were centrifuged at 4000 × g for 15 min to give a compact pellet. The protein-lipid pellet was positioned in the center of the EPR cavity of a Bruker ECS 106 spectrometer (Bruker BioSpin, Milton, Ontario, Canada). The EPR spectra were recorded at room temperature using a microwave power of 10.0 milliwatts and a modulation amplitude of 1.0 G. To estimate the amount of free unbound MBP, the supernatant of the final centrifugation step (see above) was also probed by EPR spectroscopy and no detectable signal was recorded. We conclude that all of the MBP reacted with the lipid vesicles and that there was no unbound protein. An empirical motion parameter τ0 was determined from the first derivatives of the absorption spectra using Equation 1, τ0=K×ΔHh0h-11/2-1(Eq. 1) where K = 6.5 × 10–10 s, ΔH is the width of the center-line and h 0 and h –1 are the heights of the center and high field lines, respectively (Fig. 2a) (23Boggs J.M. Moscarello M.A. J. Membr. Biol. 1978; 39: 75-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). For the membrane-bound samples, changes in the mobility of the probe were quantified using the width of the center-line (ΔH) (a greater ΔH value represented a decreased mobility of the spin label) (17Mchaourab H.S. Lietzow M.A. Hideg K. Hubbell W.L. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 7692-7704Crossref PubMed Scopus (525) Google Scholar, 24Rauch M.E. Ferguson C.G. Prestwich G.D. Cafiso D.S. J. Biol.

Depth Measurements via Continuous Wave (CW) Power Saturation— The depths of penetration of spin-labeled sites of all of the proteins into Cyt-LUVs were determined from CW power saturation. Experiments and data analysis were performed essentially as described previously (25Klug C.S. Su W. Feix J.B. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 13027-13033Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 26Klug C.S. Eaton S.S. Eaton G.R. Feix J.B. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 9016-9023Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) using a Varian E102 Century Series spectrometer (Varian Associates, Palo Alto, CA) equipped with a loop-gap resonator (Medical Advances, Milwaukee, WI). Because of the increased sensitivity of this resonator, the amount of sample used for CW saturation was halved (1 mg of LUVs, 50 μg of protein). After spinning down the lipid-protein aggregate, 5 μl of it was loaded into a gas-permeable TPX capillary (27Popp C.A. Hyde J.S. J. Magn. Reson. 1981; 43: 249-258Google Scholar). The field modulation was 1.25 G, and the incident microwave power was varied from 0.1 to 81 milliwatts. The P ½ value was determined by fitting the amplitude A of the m I = 0 peak to Equation 2, A=I×P1+(21/ϵ-1)PP1/2-ϵ(Eq. 2) where I is a scaling factor, ϵ is a measure of the homogeneity of saturation of the resonance line, P is the microwave power, and P ½ is the power necessary for reducing amplitude (A) to half of its unsaturated value. Power saturation was done on one full set of samples when equilibrated first with nitrogen and then with air and on another set of samples when equilibrated with nitrogen in the presence of 20 mm NiEDDA. The ΔP ½ was obtained by the difference in the P ½ values in the presence and absence of NiEDDA and O2. The normalized accessibility parameter (π) was calculated from ΔP ½ as described previously (28Farahbakhsh Z.T. Altenbach C. Hubbell W.L. Photochem. Photobiol. 1992; 56: 1019-1033Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar) using diphenylpicrylhydrazine to standardize resonator performance. The ΔP ½ values were used to calculate ϕ according to Equation 3, Φ=InΔP1/2(O2)ΔP1/2(NiEDDA)(Eq. 3) This parameter describes the relative depth of the spin label in the bilayer due to the gradient of NiEDDA and O2 along the bilayer normal. The dependence of ϕ on distances from the membrane surface was determined using head group-labeled TEMPO-PC and various PCs with doxyl nitroxides along the acyl chain at positions 5, 7, 10, and 12. The nitroxide-labeled PCs were mixed with the lipids used for Cyt-LUVs at a molar ratio of 1:500 in chloroform, and LUVs were prepared as described above. The calibration was done using Cyt-LUVs without protein as well as two concentrations of unlabeled qC1. The first concentration was a molar ratio of lipid to protein of 600:1 (identical to that used for the depth measurements), and the second concentration was a saturating amount of unlabeled qC1 (150:1 lipid to protein). The resultant ϕ values were used in conjunction with the known depth (distance of the nitroxide nitrogen from the phosphate) of spin-labeled PC doxyl nitroxides (29Dalton L.A. McIntyre J.O. Fleischer S. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 2117-2130Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) to generate a standard curve for determining the absolute depth of the MTS-SL labels in the protein when bound to the bilayer. The distance of the nitrogen to the phosphate in TEMPO-PC was estimated to be 5 Å based on molecular models by Farahbakhsh et al. (28Farahbakhsh Z.T. Altenbach C. Hubbell W.L. Photochem. Photobiol. 1992; 56: 1019-1033Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Previous results have demonstrated that the linear dependence of the depth parameter breaks down with increasing distance into the aqueous phase and behaves according to Equation 4 (30Frazier A.A. Wisner M.A. Malmberg N.J. Victor K.G. Fanucci G.E. Nalefski E.A. Falke J.J. Cafiso D.S. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 6282-6292Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar), Φ=Atanh[B(x-C)]+D(Eq. 4) where x is the distance from the nitrogen of the nitroxide label to the lipid phosphate, A and D define the bulk values of ϕ in water and hydrocarbon, and B and C describe the slope of the curve and the inflection point, respectively. This equation was then used to solve for the distance (x) using the experimentally derived values of ϕ. Labeled MBP Sites Are Not Sequestered in Aqueous Solution—In aqueous solution, all the spin-labeled residues of both qC1 and qC8 gave a spectrum similar to that in Fig. 2a. These spectra were consistent with unstructured nitroxide-labeled proteins or peptides with no sites that were predominantly sequestered in a hydrophobic pocket (31Qin Z. Wertz S.L. Jacob J. Savino Y. Cafiso D.S. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 13272-13276Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The spectra of similar shape were obtained in 30% sucrose used to restrict tumbling motion of the protein molecule (17Mchaourab H.S. Lietzow M.A. Hideg K. Hubbell W.L. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 7692-7704Crossref PubMed Scopus (525) Google Scholar). The type of isotropic motion represented indicated that there was very little immobilization at any of the sites probed with the nitroxide radicals. The motional parameters (τ0) of each residue were also calculated and averaged to yield 0.69 ns (±0.07 ns S.D.). Since the error associated with each τ0 is roughly 0.13 ns as estimated from several replicate experiments, we conclude that there is no significant difference in mobility for any of the spin-labeled sites in solution. The qC8 Spin Labels Are Less Immobilized than the qC1 Spin Labels in the Bilayer—The interactions with Cyt-LUVs of qC1 and qC8 spin-labeled at sites S17C, S44C, S67C, H85C, S99C, S129C, and S159C were monitored from the EPR spectra. Upon interaction of these proteins with Cyt-LUVs, the motion became more anisotropic and the sharp hyperfine lines were broadened, indicating a decrease in mobility (Figs. 2b and 3, a and b). In some cases, especially H85R1, S129R1, and S159R1 in qC1, a second more immobilized component was observed as indicated by an arrow on the low field side in Fig. 3a. There was no exchange broadening indicative of MBP oligomerization in any of the spectra. The spectra in Fig. 3, a and b, showed several differences between qC1 and qC8. The mobility of most labeled residues in qC8 was greater as can be seen especially from the sharper high field peak at m I = –1. There was also a decrease in the more immobilized component seen for qC1 at H85R1 and S129R1. To quantify the degree of mobility, the widths of the center-lines (ΔH) were measured and compared as 1/ΔH (Fig. 4). Generally, a higher value of 1/ΔH means that the relative mobility is greater. The spin labels at sites S17C, S67C, S129C, and S159C in qC8 were more mobile than at the same sites in qC1. Overall, the difference between the spin-label environments in qC1 and qC8 was more pronounced the closer the label was to an Arg/Lys → Gln substitution. However, H85R1 was more mobile in qC8 than in qC1 (seen especially from the loss of immobilized component from the spectrum in Fig. 3b, rather than from the change in ΔH in Fig. 4) even though there was no Arg/Lys → Gln substitution in the vicinity. This result indicates that this site might be more sensitive to its environment or that quasi-deimination and reduced lipid binding effected a local structural perturbation. Role of the Phe-Phe Sites in Anchoring qC1 and qC8 in the Bilayer—The spin labels at sites S44C and H85C next to two Phe-Phe pairs at positions Phe-42/Phe-43 and Phe-86/Phe-87 were the most immobilized in qC1 and qC8 (Figs. 3b and 4), suggesting that they anchor qC1 and qC8 in the bilayer. The two Phe-Phe pairs were expected to provide a hydrophobic component to the free energy of binding of MBP to lipid bilayers. To estimate the relative importance of these Phe-Phe sites, both Phe-42/Phe-43 and Phe-86/Phe-87 were substituted by Ala-42/Ala-43 and Ala-86/Ala-87 in qC1-S44C and qC1-H85C, respectively. The Phe-Phe → Ala-Ala substitutions caused significant differences in the environments of adjacent probes and hence mobilities and spectral line shapes, especially for qC1-H85R1 (Fig. 3c, arrows). In fact, qC1-F86A/F87A/H85R1 was the most mobile of all of the sites probed as can be seen from the ΔH values in Fig. 4. In contrast, qC1-F42A/F43A/S44R1 was motionally restricted even with the Phe-Phe → Ala-Ala substitutions. Depth Measurements via CW Power Saturation—The EPR spectral line shapes (and hence values of ΔH and τ0) could depend not only on the depth of penetration of the spin label into the lipid bilayer but also on secondary structural changes that can be induced in MBP by its interaction with lipids. For this reason, direct measurements of depth of penetration of each spin label into the membrane were performed using power saturation approaches (25Klug C.S. Su W. Feix J.B. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 13027-13033Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 26Klug C.S. Eaton S.S. Eaton G.R. Feix J.B. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 9016-9023Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Table I summarizes the π and ϕ values calculated for all of the proteins when bound to Cyt-LUVs.Table ICollision and depth parameters for qC1, qC8, and lipid spin label standards a Due to the unique combination of lipids present in the Cyt-LUVs, proper calibration of the ϕ value using the spin-labeled lipids was essential. The NiEDDA accessibility of the lipid nitroxide was significantly higher in the cholesterol-containing Cyt-LUVs than in the PC or PC/PS lipid mixtures usually used for these measurements (18Victor K. Cafiso D.S. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 3402-3410Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 30Frazier A.A. Wisner M.A. Malmberg N.J. Victor K.G. Fanucci G.E. Nalefski E.A. Falke J.J. Cafiso D.S.

Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 7670-7681Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar, 33Subczynski W.K. Hyde J.S. Kusumi A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 4474-4478Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar) have shown that cholesterol increases the water permeability and reduces oxygen permeability of the bilayer up to C7 or C9 of the acyl chain of saturated and unsaturated lipids, respectively. Consequently, NiEDDA would actually penetrate Cyt-LUVs more easily up to a depth of 10 Å, which means that all of the nitroxide spin labels in MBP would be more available for collisional quenching than they would be in a bilayer lacking cholesterol. The experimentally determined depth of the spin labels (29Dalton L.A. McIntyre J.O. Fleischer S. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 2117-2130Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) was plotted versus the ϕ values (Fig. 5a), and a curve was then fit to the data using the hyperbolic tangent function described in Equation 4. This function was first reported by Frazier et al. (30Frazier A.A. Wisner M.A. Malmberg N.J. Victor K.G. Fanucci G.E. Nalefski E.A. Falke J.J. Cafiso D.S. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 6282-6292Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) and provides a description of the limiting behavior of ϕ that can be applied to sites on the aqueous side of the bilayer interface. To determine the lipid spin label accessibility in the presence of MBP bound to the surface of the membrane, the calibration curve was also determined with the addition of 50 μg of unlabeled qC1 (as used for spin-labeled MBP) and with 180 μg of unlabeled qC1 to saturate the acidic phospholipid head groups. The presence of MBP increased the depth parameter (Fig. 5a), and the curve was fit to data for the samples containing 180 μg of qC1. Despite the differences in lipid composition from that used by Frazier et al. (30Frazier A.A. Wisner M.A. Malmberg N.J. Victor K.G. Fanucci G.E. Nalefski E.A. Falke J.J. Cafiso D.S. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 6282-6292Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar), Equation 4 resulted in an extremely good fit of the data (r 2 = 0.9998) (Fig. 5a). The distance data for the various spin-labeled MBPs were obtained by solving for the distance using experimentally determined ϕ values (Fig. 5b). The calibration curve changes very little below a ϕ value of –2, making it impossible to solve for the relative depths of some of the"
https://openalex.org/W2002897522,"The degradation of hemoglobin by the malaria parasite, Plasmodium falciparum, produces free ferriprotoporphyrin IX (FP) as a toxic by-product. In the presence of FP-binding drugs such as chloroquine, FP detoxification is inhibited, and the build-up of free FP is thought to be a key mechanism in parasite killing. In an effort to identify parasite proteins that might interact preferentially with FP, we have used a mass spectrometry approach. Proteins that bind to FP immobilized on agarose include P. falciparum glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (PfGAPDH), P. falciparum glutathione reductase (PfGR), and P. falciparum protein disulfide isomerase. To examine the potential consequences of FP binding, we have examined the ability of FP to inhibit the activities of GAPDH and GR from P. falciparum and other sources. FP inhibits the enzymic activity of PfGAPDH with a K i value of 0.2 μm, whereas red blood cell GAPDH is much less sensitive. By contrast, PfGR is more resistant to FP inhibition (K i > 25 μm) than its human counterpart. We also examined the ability of FP to inhibit the activities of the additional antioxidant enzymes, P. falciparum thioredoxin reductase, which exhibits a K i value of 1 μm, and P. falciparum glutaredoxin, which shows more moderate sensitivity to FP. The exquisite sensitivity of PfGAPDH to FP may indicate that the glycolytic pathway of the parasite is particularly susceptible to modulation by FP stress. Inhibition of this pathway may drive flux through the pentose phosphate pathway ensuring sufficient production of reducing equivalents to counteract the oxidative stress induced by FP build-up.

If the released FP were allowed to accumulate within this compartment, the intravacuolar FP level could reach 300–500 mm (1Tilley L. Loria P. Foley M. Rosenthal P.J. Antimalarial Chemotherapy. Humana Press, Totowa, NJ2001: 87-122Google Scholar). The parasite is thought to detoxify most of the FP by sequestration into a pigment known as hemozoin (2Slater A.F. Cerami A. Nature. 1992; 355: 167-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (538) Google Scholar). Degradation of FP has been proposed as an alternative mechanism for detoxification (3Zhang J. Krugliak M. Ginsburg H. Mol Biochem. Parasitol. 1999; 99: 129-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 4Loria P. Miller S. Foley M. Tilley L. Biochem. J. 1999; 339: 363-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). However, recent chemical analyses of parasitized erythrocytes indicate that most of the iron is located within the food vacuole and that at least 90% of it is in the form of hemozoin (5Egan T.J. Combrinck J.M. Egan J. Hearne G.R. Marques H.M. Ntenteni S. Sewell B.T. Smith P.J. Taylor D. van Schalkwyk D.A. Walden J.C. Biochem. J. 2002; 365: 343-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). Nonetheless, it is likely that a part of the population of FP escapes the crystallization process and diffuses down the concentration and pH gradient into the parasite cytosol. Indeed, the cellular “free” (i.e. detergent-soluble) FP in Plasmodium falciparum-infected erythrocytes has been estimated to be about 0.1 mm (4Loria P. Miller S. Foley M. Tilley L. Biochem. J. 1999; 339: 363-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar, 6Ginsburg H. Famin O. Zhang J. Krugliak M. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1998; 56: 1305-1313Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). Free FP is toxic because of its detergent-like properties and its ability to undergo redox chemistry. Thus, the degradation of hemoglobin and the consequent production of FP and reactive oxygen species represent an “Achilles heel” that leaves the parasite susceptible to attack by drugs that interfere with detoxification or enhance the toxicity of the waste products (see Refs. 1Tilley L. Loria P. Foley M. Rosenthal P.J. Antimalarial Chemotherapy. Humana Press, Totowa, NJ2001: 87-122Google Scholar and 7Francis S.E. Sullivan Jr., D.J. Goldberg D.E. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1997; 51: 97-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (666) Google Scholar for reviews). For example, the 4-aminoquinoline, chloroquine (CQ), has been shown to accumulate in the food vacuole and to form a complex with FP (8Chou A.C. Chevli R. Fitch C.D. Biochemistry. 1980; 19: 1543-1549Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar, 9Egan T.J. Mavuso W.W. Ross D.C. Marques H.M. J. Inorg. Biochem. 1997; 68: 137-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). As a result CQ inhibits FP detoxification processes and thereby increases free FP levels (3Zhang J. Krugliak M. Ginsburg H. Mol Biochem. Parasitol. 1999; 99: 129-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 4Loria P. Miller S. Foley M. Tilley L. Biochem.

A. 1991; 88: 325-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar). Similarly, the endoperoxide antimalarial artemisinin is thought to react with reduced FP to form a cytotoxic carbon-centered radical intermediate that oxidizes susceptible groups within parasite enzymes and lipids (11Olliaro P.L.

The parasite protects itself against oxidative stress utilizing small molecular weight antioxidants and a series of antioxidant enzymes. The tripeptide glutathione (GSH) represents the most important low molecular weight antioxidant in P. falciparum. It is involved in redox regulation and the detoxification of reactive oxygen species by direct chemical reactions and functions as an electron donor for glutathione S-transferase and glutaredoxins (14Becker K.

Schirmer R.H. FEBS Lett. 1998; 422: 311-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). In addition, the thioredoxin system, consisting of thioredoxin (Trx), thioredoxin reductase (TrxR) (18Kanzok S.M. Schirmer R.H. Turbachova I. Iozef R. Becker K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 40180-40186Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar), and Trx-dependent peroxidases (19Rahlfs S. Becker K. Eur. J.

Life Sci. 2002; 59: 1024-1041Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Apart from its redox-regulatory functions, Trx serves as an electron donor for ribonucleotide reductase, thereby supporting DNA synthesis (21Holmgren A. Antioxid.

A glutathione-dependent peroxidase seems to be absent in P. falciparum, whereas at least four Trx-dependent peroxidases appear to be present (19Rahlfs S. Becker K. Eur. J.

The work described here employed a protein profiling approach to identify FP-binding proteins within the parasite. Some of the enzymes that were identified by this approach were further characterized by examining the ability of FP to inhibit their enzymic activities. These studies allow us to speculate on the possible regulatory role of free FP in controlling parasite metabolism.

FP was purchased as hemin chloride from Sigma or Porphyrin Products and was prepared daily as a 10 mm stock in 0.1 m NaOH. Fractionation of P. falciparum-infected Erythrocytes—Parasites (D10, HB3 strains) were cultured and harvested as described previously (29Papalexis V. Siomos M.A. Campanale N. Guo X. Kocak G. Foley M. Tilley L. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2001; 115: 77-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Harvested parasites were mixed with 0.15% saponin (w/v) for 10 min at room temperature to release the erythrocyte cytosol and parasitophorous vacuolar contents. The parasite pellet was washed twice with ice-cold PBS and extracted with 20 ml of 50 mm MgCl2, 50 mm MOPS, 50 mm Tris, 25 μg/ml DNase I, 6.25 μg/ml RNase I, and Roche complete protease inhibitor mixture, pH 7.2. The sample was triturated using a 27-guage needle and further disrupted in a bath sonicator for 10 min. The insoluble material was pelleted at 400,000 × g for 30 min and the soluble proteins concentrated by ultrafiltration. Binding to Immobilized FP—Typically, 0.2–0.5 ml of a sample containing 150–400 μg of protein was mixed with FP to a final concentration of 0.5 mm or with an equivalent volume of PBS and incubated for 5 min at room temperature. Agarose-immobilized FP (50 μl of 6.7 μmol FP/ml beads from Sigma) was added and incubated at room temperature for 2 min. The beads were pelleted and washed twice with PBS, 1.5 mm MgCl, 0.5 m NaCl. Bound proteins were eluted by boiling in SDS sample buffer and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Alternatively, samples corresponding to the applied sample and the flow-through were analyzed by SDS-PAGE, and FP-binding proteins were identified from the difference between the two protein profiles. Tryptic Digestion of FP-binding Proteins—Coomassie Blue-stained protein bands were excised from SDS-polyacrylamide gels and destained with 200 μl of 200 mm NH4HCO3, 10% acetonitrile for 45 min at 37 °C. The supernatants were replaced with 100 μl of 2 mm tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine hydrochloride (TCEP-HCl, Pierce) in 25 mm NH4HCO3, pH 8.0, to reduce the proteins for 15 min at 37 °C. The supernatant was discarded, and 100 μlof20mm iodoacetamide (Sigma) in 25 mm NH4HCO3, pH 8.0, was added for 30 min at 37 °C in the dark to alkylate the proteins. The gel pieces were collected, washed three times with 200 μl of 25 mm NH4HCO3 for 15 min at 37 °C, and then dried in vacuo. The gel pieces were rehydrated with a 1.5× volume (∼20 μl) of 0.2 μg/ml sequencing grade modified trypsin (Promega) in 40 mm NH4HCO3, 10% acetonitrile, pH 8.1, and incubated for 60 min at room temperature. A further 50 μl of NH4HCO3, 10% acetonitrile was added, and digestion of protein was continued for 18 h at 37 °C with agitation. The supernatant was collected and the gel pieces extracted for 40 min at 37 °C with successive 50-μl aliquots of 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid and 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, 50% acetonitrile. The combined extracts were purified and concentrated using C18 Reversed-Phase Zip-Tips™ (Millipore). The peptides were eluted with 2.5-μl aliquots of 0.1% formic acid (Fluka) containing increasing concentrations (5–60%) of acetonitrile. MALDI-TOF and Electrospray Ionization Mass Spectrometry and N-terminal Sequencing—Aliquots (∼2 ml) of partially fractionated ingel digests were mixed with an equal volume of α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid or 2,6-dihydroxyacetophenone matrix containing di-ammonium hydrogen citrate (30Gorman J.J. Ferguson B.L. Nguyen T.B. Rapid Commun. Mass Spectrom. 1996; 10: 529-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) and analyzed using a Bruker Reflex MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry operated in the positive ion reflector mode (31Lopaticki S. Morrow C.J. Gorman J.J. J. Mass Spectrom. 1998; 33: 950-960Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Electrospray ionization mass spectrometry was performed as described by Karnezis et al. (32Karnezis T. Fisher H.C. Neumann G.M. Stone B.A. Stanisich V.A. J Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 4114-4123Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). To identify potential FP-binding proteins, peptide masses obtained from the mass spectrometric analyses were used in the search engine ProFound, to match data with the NCBI nonredundant data base entries (129.85.19.192/profound_bin/WebProfound. exe (33Zhang W. Chait B.T. Anal Chem. 2000; 72: 2482-2489Crossref PubMed Scopus (552) Google Scholar)). An error tolerance of ± 0.1 Da, the likely molecular mass range, and the iodoacetamide modification of cysteines were taken into account. Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate Dehydrogenase Assays—For measurements of specific activity (method adapted from Ferdinand (34Ferdinand W. Biochem. J. 1964; 92: 578-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar)), GAPDH (∼1 μg) was mixed with saturating substrate concentrations (0.5 mm NAD, 2 mm GAP3) in 40 mm triethanolamine, 50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.6, at 25 °C. The rate was determined over the initial 1- or 2-min period during which the kinetics were linear (∼10% of NAD+ converted to NADH). To examine the effect of FP on GAPDH kinetics, the GAPDH enzymes were incubated with either buffer (control) or FP for 5 min at room temperature prior to being added to the substrate mix (0.3 ml final volume, containing 0.5 mm NAD+, 0–2000 μm GAP3, and 0–10 μm FP in assay buffer). FP concentrations greater than 1 μm contribute significantly to the absorbance measured and can exhibit a temporal dependence that can interfere with the analysis of the kinetics. To minimize these effects, assays were performed simultaneously in duplicate in 96-well microplates. Wells containing FP without enzyme were used as blanks, and their absorbance was subtracted from the relevant samples containing enzyme. The corrected absorbance (A) at 340 nm was fitted to the empirical exponential equation: A(t) = A o exp(t/τ) + c, where t, A o, τ, and c represent time, amplitude, lifetime, and the off-set, respectively. The velocity of the reaction at the zero time point is then A o/τ. K m and V max values were determined from Lineweaver-Burk plots. The inhibition constants (K i and K i′) were determined from secondary plots where 1/V max or slope (from the Lineweaver-Burk plots) was plotted as a function of inhibitor concentration. The x-intercept in these secondary plots is equivalent to –K i′ and –K i, respectively. Glutathione Reductase Assays—In initial studies, GR activity was monitored using the method of Aft and Müller (35Aft R.L. Müller G.C. Life Sci. 1985; 36: 2153-2161Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Yeast GR (Fluka; 10 milliunits/ml) was preincubated with or without 25 μm FP in the presence of 200 μm NADPH in 100 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.5. GSSG (1 mm) was added and incubated for 40 s to allow the reduction of GSSG by the residual GR activity. The reaction was terminated by the addition of 0.05% SDS and 20 μm EDTA (35Aft R.L. Müller G.C. Life Sci. 1985; 36: 2153-2161Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), and the amount of GSH generated was followed by adding 1 mm 5,5′-dithiobis-(2-nitrobenzoic acid) (DTNB) and monitoring at 412 nm (ϵTNB = 13.6 mm–1 cm–1) where 5-thio-2-nitrobenzoate (TNB) is the product of the reaction. Additional controls with or without FP in the absence of GR were performed to correct for the non-enzymatic reaction between NADPH and FP. In a second approach the influence of FP on GR activity was measured directly using yeast, human, and P. falciparum GR in parallel. Approximately 10 milliunits/ml enzyme was incubated with or without 25 μm FP and 100 μm NADPH in 47 mm potassium phosphate, 1 mm EDTA, 200 mm KCl, pH 7.4. The assays were initiated by adding 1 mm GSSG. Thioredoxin Reductase Assays—TrxR assays (0.5 ml) were performed in 100 mm potassium phosphate, 2 mm EDTA, pH 7.4. P. falciparum TrxR (2–10 milliunits/ml), 100 μm NADPH, and FP were added, and the reaction was initiated with 20 μm PfTrx and followed at 340 nm. Corrections were made for the spontaneous reaction between FP and NADPH. For the estimation of the K i value, FP concentrations of 0, 1.25, 2, and 4 μm and Trx concentrations of 1.25 to 20 μm were examined. For studies of time dependence, 100 μm NADPH, 8 milliunits/ml TrxR, and 1.25 μm FP were incubated for up to 30 min. The reaction was initiated with 20 μm Trx. Glutaredoxin Assays—Grx activity was measured in the bis(2-hydroxyethyl)-disulfide (HEDS) assay at 340 nm as described previously (15Rahlfs S. Fischer M. Becker K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 37133-37140Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Corrections were made for the spontaneous reactions between HEDS and GSH and between FP and other assay components (GSH-dependent FP degradation, the reaction between FP and GR and the reaction between FP and NADPH). Briefly, 100 μm NADPH, 200 milliunits/ml GR, 1 mm GSH, and ∼20 nm Grx were mixed in 100 mm Tris, 1 mm EDTA, pH 8.0. The assay was initiated using 750 μm HEDS. Binding of Parasite Proteins to Immobilized FP—We have attempted to identify parasite proteins that might interact with FP that diffuses out of the parasite food vacuole. Soluble P. falciparum proteins were extracted by sonication of saponin-treated infected erythrocytes. Analysis of [35S]methionine-labeled aliquots indicated that most of the proteins in this fraction are parasite-encoded (data not shown). Western blot analysis revealed that a parasite protein located within the endoplasmic reticulum, PfERC (36La Greca N. Hibbs A.R. Riffkin C. Foley M. Tilley L. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1997; 89: 283-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), was efficiently released by these protocols (data not shown), indicating that soluble proteins from both the parasite cytosol and at least some of the organelles were present in this sample. By contrast, the exported protein, HRP2, was released during saponin lysis of the host cell and was largely absent from this fraction (data not shown). In an effort to identify the major FP-interacting proteins, we have examined the abilities of parasite proteins to interact with FP-linked agarose beads (linked via one of the carboxylic acid groups (37Tsutsui K. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 123: 331-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar)). To validate the binding assay, we examined the binding of a known FP-interacting protein, HRP2 (29Papalexis V. Siomos M.A. Campanale N. Guo X. Kocak G. Foley M. Tilley L. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2001; 115: 77-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 38Sullivan Jr., D.J. Gluzman I.Y. Goldberg D.E. Science. 1996; 271: 219-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar, 39Mashima R. Tilley L. Siomos M.A. Papalexis V. Raftery M.J. Stocker R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 14514-14520Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Recombinant HRP2 bound efficiently to the FP-agarose beads equilibrated with PBS (Fig. 1, lane a). Subsequent addition of excess FP only partly eluted the bound FP (data not shown). However, preincubation of the HRP2 solution in the presence of an excess of free FP efficiently inhibited binding of this protein to the immobilized FP beads (Fig. 1, lane b). We therefore examined the ability of soluble extracts of D10 strain parasite proteins to bind to the FP-agarose beads in the presence and absence of an excess of free FP. As shown in Fig. 1 (lane d), a number of parasite proteins bound to the immobilized FP. The profile of bound proteins is quite distinct from that for the supernatant fraction (Fig. 1, lane c). The binding of a subset of proteins was inhibited in the presence of an excess of free FP (Fig. 1, lane e, asterisks). As an alternative approach, samples corresponding to the applied protein preparation and the flow-through fraction were analyzed, and potential FP-binding proteins were identified from the difference between the two protein profiles. A similar set of proteins was identified using this approach (not shown). Similar profiles were also obtained when extracts of HB3 strain parasites were examined for FP-binding proteins (data not shown). In an effort to determine the identities of some of these FP-binding proteins, the regions containing some of the Coomassie Blue-stained bands were excised from larger format gels and subjected to trypsin digestion. The peptide fragments were eluted from the gel pieces using acetonitrile and examined by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. Mass Spectrometry—The results of the mass spectrometric analysis are given in Table I. Nine of the excised regions of the gels gave data that could be used to identify proteins. The known proteins that were identified with a good degree of confidence include P. falciparum glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (PfGAPDH), P. falciparum protein disulfide isomerase (PfPDI), P. falciparum glutathione reductase (PfGR), and a protein with a Tas domain, which is found in aryl alcohol dehydrogenases. The metalloenzyme falcilysin was also detected but the Z-value is lower. The predicted molecular masses of each of these proteins were similar to the apparent molecular masses estimated from SDS-PAGE. The number of matched peptides, the degree of coverage by peptide sequencing and the Z-scores give some estimate of the degree of confidence for the identification of proteins in the different bands. For example, the peptides identified from band 5 covered 34% of the PfPDI sequence and gave a Z-score of 2.31 when a mass tolerance of ±0.1 Da was employed. The identification of PfGAPDH was confirmed by tandem mass spectrometry fragmentation sequencing using an electrospray ionization mass spectrometer and by N-terminal sequencing (data not shown), giving further confidence in this assignment. In some cases more than one protein was identified in a particular band. For example, two polypeptide species were apparently present in band 9. Surprisingly, some of the apparently more abundant proteins, for example, the protein with an apparent molecular weight of 50 kDa, did not yield useful matches. This may be because of the specific physicochemical properties of some of the polypeptides such that they are inefficiently eluted from the gels or to the complexity of the samples, leading to weak matches to a mixture of hypothetical proteins. Given the relative complexity of the protein mixtures analyzed on these one-dimensional gels, there is some ambiguity in the protein identification; it is therefore important to emphasize that the ability of each of these proteins to bind FP needs to be confirmed in independent assays.Table IProteins identified by mass spectrometric analysis of tryptic digests of putative FP-binding proteinsBandProteinObserved mol. massCalculated mol. massMin. sequence coverageMatched peptides/ Z-scorekDakDa%1PfGAPDHaIdentified by Edman degradation/N-terminal sequencing and by tandem mass spectrometry using an electrospray ionization mass spectrometer.3636.63286/2.322P. falciparum Gap protein (gi:8250569)bNCBI gene identifier.3839.39215/1.483Hypothetical protein (gi:23509307)4040.95226/1.054Merozoite surface antigen 34443.38155/0.645PfPDI5655.833416/2.316PfGR5756.892312/1.977Ribosomal processing protein, putative (gi:6562730)5757.21116/0.788Hypothetical protein (gi:23508084)6261.2784/1.289afalcilysin130137.021413/0.449bHypothetical protein (gi:23509309) (Tas domain; related to ary1-alcohol dehydrogenases)130136.51514/1.03a Identified by Edman degradation/N-terminal sequencing and by tandem mass spectrometry using an electrospray ionization mass spectrometer.b NCBI gene identifier. Open table in a new tab Inhibition of GAPDH—In an effort to confirm an interaction of some of these proteins with FP and to study the likely consequences of FP binding, we investigated the effects of FP on their enzymic activities. For example, GAPDH is an important regulatory enzyme in the glycolytic pathway. As the parasite lacks the complete pathway for oxidative phosphorylation, glycolysis is the major source of ATP equivalents. The activities of recombinant PfGAPDH (28Daubenberger C. Poltl-Frank F. Jiang G. Lipp J. Certa U. Pluschke G. Gene. 2000; 246: 255-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) and human red blood cell (RBC) GAPDH were examined under saturating substrate concentrations (0.5 mm NAD, 2 mm GAP3). The specific activities of recombinant PfGAPDH and human RBC GAPDH were 90–120 and 155 units/mg, respectively, in good agreement with the literature (28Daubenberger C. Poltl-Frank F. Jiang G. Lipp J. Certa U. Pluschke G. Gene. 2000; 246: 255-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). In microplate-based assays, PfGAPDH showed a K m for GAP3 of 1028 μm and a V max value of 3.57 nmol/min (Fig. 2D; no FP curve). For RBC GAPDH, the K m for GAP3 was 540 μm and the V max value was 4.78 nmol/min (Fig. 2C; no FP curve). Initial studies indicated that the addition of FP resulted in a rapid initial decrease in both RBC and plasmodial GAPDH activities followed by a much slower time-dependent inactivation of the enzyme (data not shown).

https://openalex.org/W1980271338,"S100A6 (calcyclin), a small calcium-binding protein from the S100 family, interacts with several target proteins in a calcium-regulated manner. One target is Calcyclin-Binding Protein/Siah-1-Interacting Protein (CacyBP/SIP), a component of a novel pathway of β-catenin ubiquitination. A recently discovered yeast homolog of CacyBP/SIP, Sgt1, associates with Skp1 and regulates its function in the Skp1/Cullin1/F-box complex ubiquitin ligase and in kinetochore complexes. S100A6-binding domain of CacyBP/SIP is in its C-terminal region, where the homology between CacyBP/SIP and Sgt1 is the greatest. Therefore, we hypothesized that Sgt1, through its C-terminal region, interacts with S100A6. We tested this hypothesis by performing affinity chromatography and chemical cross-linking experiments. Our results showed that Sgt1 binds to S100A6 in a calcium-regulated manner and that the S100A6-binding domain in Sgt1 is comprised of 71 C-terminal residues. Moreover, S100A6 does not influence Skp1-Sgt1 binding, a result suggesting that separate Sgt1 domains are responsible for interactions with S100A6 and Skp1. Sgt1 binds not only to S100A6 but also to S100B and S100P, other members of the S100 family. The interaction between S100A6 and Sgt1 is likely to be physiologically relevant because both proteins were co-immunoprecipitated from HEp-2 cell line extract using monoclonal anti-S100A6 antibody. Phosphorylation of the S100A6-binding domain of Sgt1 by casein kinase II was inhibited by S100A6, a result suggesting that the role of S100A6 binding is to regulate the phosphorylation of Sgt1. These findings suggest that protein ubiquitination via Sgt1-dependent pathway can be regulated by S100 proteins. S100A6 (calcyclin), a small calcium-binding protein from the S100 family, interacts with several target proteins in a calcium-regulated manner.

These findings suggest that protein ubiquitination via Sgt1-dependent pathway can be regulated by S100 proteins. S100 proteins are a family of small, highly homologous proteins that contain two calcium-binding EF-hand motifs (reviewed in Ref. 1Donato R. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2001; 33: 637-668Crossref PubMed Scopus (1329) Google Scholar). Because the binding of calcium ions is the most important biochemical feature of S100 proteins, they are thought to function as sensors of calcium ion concentration in the cell. They appear to have several functions, including regulation of protein phosphorylation, cytoskeleton polymerization, and cell cycle progression. S100A6 (calcyclin) is a typical member of the S100 family. The function of S100A6 remains unclear, but evidence suggests that it is involved in cell cycle regulation (2Calabretta B. Battini R.

S100A6 may also be involved in tumorigenesis; the protein is overexpressed in several tumors, e.g. melanoma (6Weterman M.A. Stoopen G.M. van Muijen G.N. Kuznicki J. Ruiter D.J. Bloemers H.P. Cancer Res. 1992; 52: 1291-1296PubMed Google Scholar). Attempts to elucidate the function of S100A6 have involved the search for its calcium-regulated target proteins. Several such proteins have been identified: glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (7Filipek A. Gerke V. Weber K. Kuznicki J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 195: 795-800Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), annexin II (8Filipek A. Wojda U. Lesniak W. Int. J. Biochem.

FEBS Lett. 1992; 305: 217-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). In 1996, a novel mouse protein was identified on the basis of its ability to interact with S100A6 in a calcium-dependent manner (11Filipek A. Wojda U. Biochem. J. 1996; 320: 585-587Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). It was named Calcyclin-Binding Protein (CacyBP) 1The abbreviations used are: CacyBP/SIP, calcyclin (S100A6) binding protein/Siah-1-interacting protein; EDC, 1-ethyl-3-[3-dimethyl-aminopropyl]carbodiimide hydrochloride; NHS, N-hydroxysuccinimide. (12Filipek A. Kuznicki J. J. Neurochem. 1998; 70: 1793-1798Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). In vitro characterization of the interaction between S100A6 and CacyBP showed that the S100A6-binding domain in CacyBP is comprised of 52 C-terminal residues and that the dissociation constant for the S100A6-CacyBP complex is ∼1 μm (13Nowotny M. Bhattacharya S. Filipek A. Krezel A.M. Chazin W. Kuznicki J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 31178-31182Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). CacyBP is expressed in many tissues in mice and rats, but its highest expression level is in the brain (14Jastrzebska B. Filipek A. Nowicka D. Kaczmarek L. Kuznicki J. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 2000; 48: 1195-1202Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). In cortical neurons, upon cell stimulation and elevation of intracellular calcium concentration, CacyBP undergoes a translocation from the cytoplasm to the perinuclear space (15Filipek A. Jastrzebska B. Nowotny M. Kwiatkowska K. Hetman M. Surmacz L. Wyroba E. Kuznicki J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 21103-21109Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Recently, a human ortholog of CacyBP, called SIP (Siah-1-Interacting Protein) was shown to be a component of a novel ubiquitin ligase complex (16Matsuzawa S.I. Reed J.C. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 915-926Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (531) Google Scholar) (hereafter we refer to both proteins as CacyBP/SIP). In the ubiquitin ligase complex, the N-terminal region of CacyBP/SIP interacts with Siah-1, and the C-terminal region interacts with Skp1. Skp1 binds to Ebi, a protein that recognizes β-catenin, which is the substrate that is ubiquitinated and later degraded. β-catenin is an important oncogene involved in the development of colon cancer (17Barker N. Clevers H. Bioessays. 2000; 22: 961-965Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar, 18Bienz M. Clevers H. Cell. 2000; 103: 311-320Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1308) Google Scholar). It regulates the activity of Tcf/Lef transcription factors, which promote cell proliferation. A separate pool of β-catenin participates in adherens junctions (19Ben-Ze'ev A. Geiger B. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 629-639Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). At the time of the discovery of CacyBP there were no homologs of this protein deposited in the sequence data bases. In 1999 a novel yeast protein called Sgt1 was discovered (20Kitagawa K. Skowyra D. Elledge S.J. Harper J.W. Hieter P. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 21-33Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). Its human homolog is ∼20% identical to mouse CacyBP. In yeast Sgt1 interacts with Skp1, a protein component of the SCF ubiquitin ligase and of kinetochore complexes. Some yeast Sgt1 mutants exhibit defects in chromosome segregation that result in arrest of the cell cycle at G2 phase. In other Sgt1 mutants, ubiquitination of Sic1 and Cln1 (two cell cycle regulators) is impaired, and this impairment results in cell cycle arrest at G1. These results suggested that Sgt1 is required for normal Skp1 function in kinetochore and SCF. Recently, several studies have shown involvement of Sgt1 in R gene-mediated plant defense against pathogens (review Ref. 21Gray W.M. Curr. Biol. 2002; 12: R352-R354Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). However, the link between the involvement of Sgt1 in ubiquitination and pathogen response remains unclear. The most conserved regions of CacyBP/SIP and Sgt1 are located near their C termini. The S100A6-binding domain is located in this region of CacyBP/SIP (13Nowotny M. Bhattacharya S. Filipek A. Krezel A.M. Chazin W. Kuznicki J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 31178-31182Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Therefore, we determined whether human Sgt1 interacts with S100A6 and other S100 proteins and characterized this interaction. These results, together with our previous data on CacyBP/SIP (22Filipek A. Jastrzebska B. Nowotny M. Kuznicki J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 28848-28852Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar), suggest that S100 proteins can regulate two different ubiquitination pathways in a calcium-dependent manner. Plasmids—We prepared the plasmids pET28-Sgt1 and pET28-Sgt1-(263–333) by the following methods. The appropriate fragments of human Sgt1 DNA were amplified from the BKK51 plasmid (20Kitagawa K. Skowyra D. Elledge S.J. Harper J.W. Hieter P. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 21-33Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar) by PCR with Pfu polymerase: forward primers, 5′-TAAATCATATGGCGGCGGCTGCAGCA-3′ for pET28-Sgt1 and 5′-GCCCGCATATGAAAGAAGAAGAAAAGAAT-3′ for pET28-Sgt1-(263–333), and the same backward primer for both constructs, 5′-CGGCGGGATCCTTAGTACTTTTTCCATTCCA-3′ (restriction endonucleases recognition sites in bold). PCR products and vector (pET28a; Novagen) were digested with restriction endonucleases (NdeI and BamHI, both from Promega). The fragments of appropriate size were purified from the agarose gel using the QIAquick gel extraction kit (Qiagen). The appropriate vector and insert were ligated by T4 DNA ligase (Promega), and the ligation products were used to transform Escherichia coli (TOP10F′ strain). Single-colony PCR was used to detect colonies that contained the insert. The plasmids were purified and sequenced. The plasmid pET21d-Skp1-H6 (23Ng R.W. Arooz T. Yam C.H. Chan I.W. Lau A.W. Poon R.Y. FEBS Lett. 1998; 438: 183-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) was generously provided by Dr. R. Poon from Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, China. Expression and Purification of Sgt1, Sgt1-(263–333), and Skp1— Expression plasmids were introduced into the E. coli BL21(DE3) strain (Novagen). The bacteria were cultured in Luria Bertani medium with kanamycin, and expression was induced by the addition of isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. The bacteria were further cultured for ∼3 h. The expressed His-tagged proteins were purified on nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose resin (Qiagen) as previously described (22Filipek A. Jastrzebska B. Nowotny M. Kuznicki J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 28848-28852Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). The His tag was removed by biotinylated thrombin (Novagen) cleavage according to the manufacturer's instructions. The proteins were dialyzed against a desired buffered solution. Affinity Chromatography—The coupling of Sgt1 and CacyBP/SIP to CNBr-activated-Sepharose was carried out according to the manufacturer's instructions (Amersham Biosciences). CNBr-activated-Sepharose was equilibrated in borate buffer (50 mm boric acid, pH 8.2, 0.4 m NaCl), and Sgt1 or CacyBP/SIP, both without a His tag, was added. After a 2-h incubation at room temperature, the resin was washed, and the sites for nonspecific binding were blocked by incubation in 0.1 m Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) for 2 h. Next, the resin was washed several times with 0.1 m acetate buffer (pH 4.0) containing 0.5 m NaCl and 0.1 m Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) containing 0.5 m NaCl. Rabbit S100A6 was purified as previously described (8Filipek A. Wojda U. Lesniak W. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1995; 27: 1123-1131Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). 7 μg of S100A6 was applied to Sgt1-Sepharose, CacyBP/SIP-Sepharose, and empty resin in buffer A (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5) containing 1 mm CaCl2. The resin was washed with buffer A containing CaCl2 and 0.5 m NaCl, and bound protein was eluted with buffer A containing 2 mm EGTA. Collected fractions were precipitated with acetone and analyzed by SDS-Tricine-PAGE. Chemical Cross-linking—His-tagged Sgt1 (15 μg) or His-tagged Sgt1-(263–333) (5 μg) were mixed with 7 μg of S100A6 in the presence of 1 mm CaCl2 or 2 mm EGTA. EDC and NHS cross-linking reagents (Sigma) were added from fresh stocks to 4 and 10 mm final concentration, respectively. In control reactions, Sgt1 and S100A6 were cross-linked alone or both proteins were incubated without cross-linking reagents. After the reaction was carried out for 1 h at room temperature, the proteins were precipitated with acetone and analyzed on SDS-glycine-PAGE or SDS-Tricine-PAGE. Fifteen percent of each reaction mixture was analyzed using Western blot with anti-S100A6 polyclonal antibody, anti-Sgt1 polyclonal antibody, or anti-His tag monoclonal antibody (HIS-1; Sigma). The blots were incubated with a chemiluminescent substrate (Super Signal; Pierce) and then exposed to photographic film (Amersham Biosciences). Competition Assay—Six micrograms of His-tagged human Skp1 in buffer A (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5) with 1 mm CaCl2 or 2 mm EGTA was applied to Sepharose alone or Sgt1-conjugated-Sepharose. Parallel reactions with Sgt1-conjugated-Sepharose were performed in the presence of 70 μg of S100A6 (6-fold molar excess over Skp1). The unbound fraction was collected, the resin washed, and the bound protein eluted with buffer A containing 2 mm EGTA and 0.5 m NaCl. The proteins were precipitated with trichloroacetic acid and analyzed by SDS-glycine-PAGE. Interaction of Calcium-binding Proteins with Sgt1-conjugated-Sepharose—The following calcium-binding proteins were used in the assay: parvalbumin, which was a gift from Dr. C. W. Heizmann, Zurich University, Switzerland; calbindin D9k, a gift from Dr. S. Linse, Lund University, Sweden; S100A8, a gift from Dr. C. Kerkhoff, University of Muenster, Germany; and S100A4, a gift from Dr. R. Barraclough, University of Liverpool, Great Britain. The remaining calcium-binding proteins were S100A1, S100B, and calmodulin (each purchased from Sigma). The binding assay was performed as described under “Affinity Chromatography” with 5 μg of each calcium-binding protein in buffer A (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5) and 1 mm CaCl2 applied to Sgt1-conjugated-Sepharose. Co-immunoprecipitation—Human epidermal cells (HEp-2 cell line) were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, penicillin (100 units/ml), and streptomycin (100 μg/ml). For co-immunoprecipitation, cells were lysed in buffer I (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol) with protease inhibitors (Complete™ EDTA-free; Roche Applied Science) and next centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min. Supernatant was then incubated with CaCl2 (2 mm final) for 15 min at room temperature and then monoclonal antibody against S100A6 (CACY-100 clone; Sigma) was added for 1 h at room temperature. The reactions were next incubated with protein G-agarose (Sigma) for 1 h at room temperature. After incubation the beads were washed five times in buffer I containing 2 mm CaCl2. The proteins bound to G-agarose were eluted with a buffer containing 100 mm glycine-HCl, pH 2.7, and precipitated with cold acetone. The pellets were then solubilized in sample buffer and applied on the SDS-glycine-PAGE. After electrophoresis, the proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose sheets and analyzed with antibodies against Sgt1. The blots were developed with β-chloronaphtol and H2O2. Protein Phosphorylation—Phosphorylation of Sgt1-(263–333) (no His tag) with human recombinant casein kinase II (Calbiochem) was carried out in reactions with 400 ng of the kinase in buffer containing 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 50mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.2 mm ATP, and 1 mm CaCl2 or 2 mm EGTA. The final volume of the reactions was 50 μl. The reactions were preincubated for 20 min at 30 °C, and 2 μg of Sgt1-(263–333), 2 μg of S100A6 or both proteins were added with [γ-32P]ATP in final concentration of 0.2 mm. The reaction was carried out for 30 min at 30 °C and stopped by the addition of PAGE sample buffer and boiling. The proteins were analyzed in SDS-glycine-PAGE, and the gels were exposed to photographic film. Interaction between S100A6 and Sgt1—The S100A6-binding region of human CacyBP/SIP was compared with a corresponding fragment of human Sgt1 using ClustalW software (24Thompson J.D. Higgins D.G. Gibson T.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4673-4680Crossref PubMed Scopus (55766) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). In this region the amino acid identity was 29%. Because of this significant similarity between C-terminal regions of CacyBP/SIP and Sgt1, we hypothesized that Sgt1 interacts with S100A6. To test this hypothesis, recombinant human Sgt1 with N-terminal His tag was expressed in E. coli and purified on nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose resin. This one-step purification procedure yielded protein that was pure enough for biochemical characterization. The tag was cleaved off, and Sgt1 was coupled to CNBr-activated-Sepharose. Affinity chromatography was used to check whether Sgt1 could interact with S100A6 (Fig. 2). S100A6 was applied to Sgt1-Sepharose, CacyBP/SIP-Sepharose, or Sepharose alone in the presence of 1 mm CaCl2, and bound protein was eluted in the presence of 2 mm EGTA. S100A6 was present in the fractions eluted from CacyBP/SIP-bound and Sgt1-bound resins but not from Sepharose alone. This result shows that S100A6 interacts with Sgt1 in a calcium-dependent manner.Fig. 2The interaction between Sgt1 and S100A6, affinity chromatography. S100A6 was applied to Sepharose alone, Sgt1-Sepharose, or CacyBP/SIP-Sepharose in a buffer containing 1 mm CaCl2. The unbound fraction (U) and the fraction eluted with a buffer with 2 mm EGTA (E) were collected and analyzed by SDS-Tricine-PAGE stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To confirm the interaction between human Sgt1 and S100A6, we performed chemical cross-linking experiments using EDC and NHS reagents (Fig. 3A). As control reactions each individual protein was cross-linked alone and both proteins were incubated without EDC and NHS. The products of the reactions were analyzed by PAGE and Western blotting. Coomassie Blue staining of the SDS-glycine-PAGE (Fig. 3A, left panel) revealed a band (designated S) that corresponded to Sgt1 and additional bands (designated SC) not present in control reactions and larger than Sgt1 by 10 kDa, i.e. the mass of S100A6 monomer. Western blot analysis showed that proteins in the SC bands were recognized by antibody to Sgt1 (center panel) and to S100A6 (right panel). This result proved that the SC bands consisted of cross-linked complexes of Sgt1 and S100A6. These complexes were not present in the reaction carried out in the presence of EGTA; therefore, we confirmed that the interaction is calcium-dependent. A similar chemical cross-linking experiment was carried out to identify the S100A6-binding domain in Sgt1 (Fig. 3B). First, we produced a recombinant His-tagged Sgt1 fragment that consisted of residues 263 through 333 (71 residues from C terminus) and corresponded to the previously identified S100A6-binding domain in CacyBP/SIP. This tagged fragment has a calculated molecular mass of 10.5 kDa but migrates in SDS-Tricine-PAGE as a band of ∼13 kDa. We next subjected the protein to chemical cross-linking and analysis by PAGE. Coomassie Blue staining revealed a band of 10 kDa corresponding to S100A6, a band of 13 kDa corresponding to His-tagged Sgt1-(263–333), and a band of 20 kDa that corresponded to a cross-linked S100A6 dimer. An additional band was seen only in the cross-linking reaction containing all components and CaCl2. Its apparent mass was ∼10 kDa larger than that of Sgt1 fragment. The additional fragment was recognized by anti-His-tag antibody and anti-S100A6 antibody, which indicated that it corresponded to a cross-linked complex of Sgt1-(263–333) and S100A6. Therefore, the Sgt1-(263–333) fragment contains the S100A6-binding domain. Little of the cross-linked complex was detected when the reaction was carried out in the absence of CaCl2, a result confirming the calcium dependence of the binding. The Lack of Influence of S100A6 on Sgt1-Skp1 Binding—A prominent biochemical feature of Sgt1 is its ability to interact with Skp1 and regulate Skp1-containing SCF and kinetochore complexes (20Kitagawa K. Skowyra D. Elledge S.J. Harper J.W. Hieter P. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 21-33Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). Because Sgt1 also binds to S100A6, we hypothesized that S100A6 influences the Sgt1-Skp1 interaction. The S100A6-binding domain in Sgt1 is located in the C-terminal region, and the Skp1-binding domain in CacyBP/SIP is also located in its C-terminal part, after residue 74 (16Matsuzawa S.I. Reed J.C. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 915-926Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (531) Google Scholar). These facts suggested that the Skp1- and S100A6-binding domains in human Sgt1 might overlap. To determine whether mammalian S100A6 and Skp1 can compete in binding to Sgt1, we performed affinity chromatography. His-tagged human Skp1 was applied to a column containing either Sepharose alone or Sgt1-conjugated-Sepharose. The unbound fraction and the fraction eluted with 0.5 m NaCl were collected and analyzed by electrophoresis through SDS-glycine polyacrylamide gels. Skp1 bound to Sgt1-conjugated-Sepharose but not to Sepharose alone (Fig. 4). When Skp1 and a 6-fold molar excess of S100A6 were applied in the presence of CaCl2 to the column containing Sgt1-conjugated-Sepharose, the bound fraction contained both Skp1 and S100A6. Moreover, the amount of His-tagged Skp1 that bound to Sgt1 in the presence of excess S100A6 and CaCl2 did not differ from that bound in the absence of S100A6. This result shows that Skp1 and S100A6 do not compete in binding to Sgt1 and that the Skp1-binding domain and the S100A6-binding domain are probably separate in Sgt1. Interaction between Sgt1 and Other Members of the S100 Family—CacyBP/SIP interacts not only with S100A6 but also with other members of the family of highly homologous S100 proteins (22Filipek A. Jastrzebska B. Nowotny M. Kuznicki J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 28848-28852Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). To study the possible interaction between Sgt1 and S100 proteins other than S100A6, we again performed affinity chromatography using Sgt1-conjugated-Sepharose (Fig. 5). Different S100 proteins (S100A1, S100A4, S100A6, S100A8, S100B, S100P, and calbindin D9k) and other calcium-binding proteins (parvalbumin and calmodulin) were applied individually to Sgt1-conjugated-Sepharose in the presence of 1 mm CaCl2. Analysis of the unbound fraction and the fraction eluted by EGTA showed that Sgt1 interacts strongly with S100A6 and S100P proteins and more weakly with S100B. S100A1 and S100A4 were also present in the bound fraction, but the interaction was very weak and it might be nonspecific. S100A8, calbindin D9k, calmodulin and parvalbumin did not bind to Sgt1, a result showing that Sgt1 interacts with particular S100 proteins. Co-immunoprecipitation of S100A6 and Sgt1—To establish whether interaction between S100A6 and Sgt1 can occur in vivo we performed co-immunoprecipitation experiments form cell extracts using monoclonal anti-S100A6 antibody. The human epidermal HEp-2 cell line was selected for these experiments because it expresses both S100A6 and Sgt1. Fig. 6 shows that Sgt1 was co-immunoprecipitated with S100A6 in the presence of 2 mm CaCl2. Sgt1 was not co-immunoprecipitated by a non-relevant monoclonal antibody, and addition of excess recombinant CacyBP/SIP abolished the interaction, which confirms that the observed effect was specific. S100A6 Inhibits the Phosphorylation of Sgt1-(263–333)—It has been previously shown that S100 proteins are able to regulate phosphorylation of their target proteins, most often by binding and blocking the phosphorylation site. Therefore, we hypothesized that the function of Sgt1-S100A6 interaction might be to regulate the phosphorylation of the S100A6-binding domain of Sgt1. A search of PhosphoBase (25Kreegipuu A. Blom N. Brunak S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 237-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar) revealed that in Sgt1-(263–333) serine 299 can be phosphorylated by casein kinase II. To check whether this phosphorylation can be regulated by S100A6 we performed in vitro phosphorylation assays (Fig. 7). In these assays Sgt1-(263–333), but not S100A6, was efficiently phosphorylated by casein kinase II in the presence of 1 mm CaCl2. Addition of S100A6 inhibited phosphorylation of Sgt1-(263–333). In the presence of 2 mm EGTA, inhibition of Sgt1 fragment phosphorylation was much weaker. The changes in Sgt1 phosphorylation were not because of the changes in the activity of the kinase, because its autophosphorylation was equal in all the reactions. These results show that S100A6 can regulate the phosphorylation of the Sgt1 region containing the S100A6-binding domain. We also performed a phosphorylation assay with Sgt1-(263–333) fragment carrying a previously described E303K mutation (see “Discussion”). In this mutant the consensus pattern for casein kinase II site is no longer present. However E303K mutant was efficiently phosphorylated (not shown), suggesting that the casein kinase II phosphorylation site is different from the one identified by computer prediction. In this work we showed that human Sgt1, like its homolog CacyBP/SIP, interacts in a calcium-dependent manner with S100A6 and other S100 proteins. Moreover, we determined that S100A6 binds to Sgt1-(263–333), a C-terminal fragment corresponding to the domain in CacyBP/SIP that binds to S100A6 and to other S100 proteins (22Filipek A. Jastrzebska B. Nowotny M. Kuznicki J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 28848-28852Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Therefore, we assume that this C-terminal region of Sgt1 also binds S100 proteins other than S100A6. Our results also showed that S100A6 does not regulate the interaction between Sgt1 and Skp1 through simple competition. This finding suggests that separate domains for binding to S100A6 and to Skp1 exist in Sgt1. Interestingly, a functionally deficient yeast mutant, Sgt1–5, has a mutation (E364K) in the S100A6-binding domain identified in the present study. This mutation together with another point mutation outside the S100A6-binding domain causes defects in the ubiquitination of cell cycle regulators; however, the mutant protein retains the ability to interact with Skp1 (20Kitagawa K. Skowyra D. Elledge S.J. Harper J.W. Hieter P. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 21-33Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). A human CacyBP/SIP mutant modeled after Sgt1–5 that carries only a single mutation (E216K) in its S100A6-binding region acts in a dominant-negative fashion and interferes with β-catenin ubiquitination and degradation in vivo (16Matsuzawa S.I. Reed J.C. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 915-926Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (531) Google Scholar). To check whether the negative effect of these point mutations stems from the fact that they abrogate the interaction between Sgt1 and S100A6, we produced recombinant Sgt1-(263–333) fragment that carried a mutation corresponding to the mutation described above (E303K for human Sgt1). This fragment was efficiently cross-linked with S100A6, which shows that its ability to bind S100A6 was not affected. However, the properties of mutants indicate that the S100A6-binding region is essential for the function of CacyBP/SIP and Sgt1 in the ubiquitination process. When S100A6 interacts in a calcium-dependent manner with the C-terminal region, the interaction is likely to regulate the activity of CacyBP/SIP and Sgt1. To search for possible mechanisms of such regulation we studied the influence of S100A6 on Sgt1 phosphorylation. Several members of the S100 protein family have been shown to regulate the phosphorylation of their target proteins (review Refs. 1Donato R. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2001; 33: 637-668Crossref PubMed Scopus (1329) Google Scholar and 26Donato R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1450: 191-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (595) Google Scholar)). For example, S100A4 was shown to inhibit the phosphorylation of its target protein liprin β1 by protein kinase C and casein kinase II (27Kriajevska M. Fischer-Larsen M. Moertz E. Vorm O. Tulchinsky E. Grigorian M. Ambartsumian N. Lukanidin E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 5229-5235Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Our results demonstrated that the S100A6-binding domain of Sgt1 can be phosphorylated by casein kinase II and that this phosphorylation is inhibited by S100A6 binding. These findings suggest that the regulation of phosphorylation might be the physiological role of Sgt1-S100A6 interaction. In this work we demonstrated that Sgt1 is capable of interacting with several members of the S100 protein family. S100 proteins are expressed in a strictly tissue- and cell-specific fashion (28Schafer B.W. Heizmann C.W. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 134-140Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1035) Google Scholar). Therefore, the interaction between Sgt1 and S100 proteins will be regulated by the availability of S100 proteins in a given tissue and cell type. CacyBP/SIP is a component of a novel ubiquitin ligase complex responsible for ubiquitination and degradation of β-catenin (16Matsuzawa S.I. Reed J.C. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 915-926Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (531) Google Scholar). Sgt1 is associated with a different ubiquitin ligase, SCF (20Kitagawa K. Skowyra D. Elledge S.J. Harper J.W. Hieter P. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 21-33Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). The SCF complex containing β-TrCP protein is responsible for the ubiquitination of β-catenin. However, SCF- and CacyBP/SIP-dependent pathways are regulated in a different fashion. Ubiquitination by SCF requires that β-catenin is phosphorylated on serine residues (29Winston J.T. Strack P. Beer-Romero P. Chu C.Y. Elledge S.J. Harper J.W. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 270-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (811) Google Scholar, 30Yaron A. Hatzubai A. Davis M. Lavon I. Amit S. Manning A.M. Andersen J.S. Mann M. Mercurio F. Ben-Neriah Y. Nature. 1998; 396: 590-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (571) Google Scholar). In the CacyBP/SIP-mediated pathway, β-catenin ubiquitination is phosphorylation-independent and is triggered by the expression of Siah-1, a limiting component of the ligase complex (16Matsuzawa S.I. Reed J.C. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 915-926Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (531) Google Scholar). Therefore, the two pathways are activated in different conditions and are likely to play distinct roles. Because S100A6 and some other S100 proteins can interact with CacyBP/SIP and Sgt1, these S100 proteins could regulate both pathways in a similar fashion. The defects in ubiquitination and degradation of β-catenin are key events in the development of colon cancer. It has been shown that S100A6 may be involved in the progression of colon carcinoma (31Bronckart Y. Decaestecker C. Nagy N. Harper L. Schafer B.W. Salmon I. Pochet R. Kiss R. Heizman C.W. Histol. Histopathol. 2001; 16: 707-712PubMed Google Scholar, 32Stulik J. Osterreicher J. Koupilova K. Knizek J. Bures J. Jandik P. Langr F. Dedic K. Schafer B.W. Heizmann C.W. Eur. J.

Nakamura H. Oncology. 2002; 63: 192-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). For example, Komatsu et al. (34Komatsu K. Kobune-Fujiwara Y. Andoh A. Ishiguro S. Hunai H. Suzuki N. Kameyama M. Murata K. Miyoshi J. Akedo H. Tatsuta M. Nakamura H. Br. J. Cancer. 2000; 83: 769-774Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) showed that expression of S100A6 is correlated with the progression and invasive process of human colorectal carcinoma. Therefore, a very important question is whether S100 proteins, through their interaction with ubiquitin ligases, can regulate the ubiquitination of β-catenin in vivo and thus participate in the process of tumor development and progression. Currently, we are performing experiments to address this question. We thank Dr. Wieslawa Lesniak for critical reading of the manuscript."
https://openalex.org/W2168295234,"There has been no previous indication that vacuolar ATPases (V-ATPases) require sphingolipids for function. Here we show, by using Saccharomyces cerevisiae sur4Δ and fen1Δ cells, that sphingolipids with a C26 acyl group are required for generating V1 domains with ATPase activity. Sphingolipids in sur4Δ cells contain C22 and C24 acyl groups instead of C26 acyl groups whereas about 30% of the sphingolipids in fen1Δ cells have C26 acyl groups and the rest have C22 and C24 acyl groups. sur4Δ cells have several phenotypes (vacuolar membrane ATPase, Vma–) that indicate a defect in the V-ATPase, and vacuoles purified from sur4Δ cells have little to no ATPase activity. These phenotypes are less pronounced in fen1Δ cells, consistent with the idea that the C26 acyl group in sphingolipids is necessary for V-ATPase activity. Other results show that the two V-ATPase domains, V1 and V0, are assembled and delivered to the vacuolar membrane in sur4Δ cells similar to wild-type cells. In vitro assembly studies show that V1 from sur4Δ cells associates with wild-type V0 but the complex lacks V-ATPase activity, indicating that V1 is defective. Reciprocal experiments with V0 from sur4Δ cells show that it is normal. We conclude that sphingolipids with a C26 acyl group are required for generating fully functional V1 domains. There has been no previous indication that vacuolar ATPases (V-ATPases) require sphingolipids for function.

Reciprocal experiments with V0 from sur4Δ cells show that it is normal. We conclude that sphingolipids with a C26 acyl group are required for generating fully functional V1 domains. Vacuolar ATPases (V-ATPases) 1The abbreviations used are: V-ATPase, vacuolar ATPase; DHS, dihydrosphingosine; LCB, long chain base; LCBP, long chain base phosphate; PHS, phytosphingosine; VLCFA, very long chain fatty acid; V1, peripheral domain of V-ATPase; Vma, vacuolar membrane ATPase; V0, membrane domain of V-ATPase; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography; FITC, fluorescein isothiocyanate. are found in all eukaryotes where they are required for receptor-mediated endocytosis, renal acidification, bone reabsoprtion, neurotransmitter accumulation, and activation of acid hydrolases (reviewed in Refs. 1Stevens T.H. Forgac M. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1997; 13: 779-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (523) Google Scholar and 2Nishi T. Forgac M. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 3: 94-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (1005) Google Scholar). The Saccharomyces cerevisiae V-ATPase, the current paradigm for V-ATPases, moves protons from the cytosol to the lumen of the vacuole to establish a proton gradient that is necessary for vacuolar transport proteins to drive ions and small molecules, amino acids, and metabolites into the vacuole (reviewed in Ref. 3Graham L.A. Powell B. Stevens T.H. J. Exp. Biol. 2000; 203 (Pt 1): 61-70Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Knowledge of the S. cerevisiae V-ATPase has grown rapidly but remains incomplete. One area where little is known is the influence of membrane lipids on V-ATPase activity. Here we show that sphingolipids are necessary for V-ATPase activity in S. cerevisiae. S. cerevisiae V-ATPase contains two components or domains, V1 and V0, which associate to form an active V1V0 complex on the vacuolar membrane (reviewed in Refs. 3Graham L.A. Powell B. Stevens T.H. J. Exp. Biol. 2000; 203 (Pt 1): 61-70Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 4Forgac M. J. Exp. Biol. 2000; 203: 71-80Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 5Kane P.M. Parra K.J. J. Exp. Biol. 2000; 203 (Pt 1): 81-87Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The V1 domain has ATPase activity and is composed of 8 different proteins. It can exist free in the cytoplasm or complexed with V0 on the vacuolar membrane. The V0 domain contains 5 protein subunits and is imbedded in the vacuolar membrane where it serves as a proton pore. The V1 and V0 domains are assembled and associate in the ER to form functional V1V0 complexes, which are then transported from the Golgi to the vacuole (reviewed in Refs. 3Graham L.A. Powell B. Stevens T.H. J. Exp. Biol. 2000; 203 (Pt 1): 61-70Crossref PubMed Google Scholar and 5Kane P.M. Parra K.J. J. Exp. Biol. 2000; 203 (Pt 1): 81-87Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Alternatively, the two domains assemble independently and then associate once V0 reaches the vacuole. The ER is also where sphingolipid synthesis begins (reviewed in Ref. 6Dickson R.C. Lester R.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1583: 13-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar) with generation of ceramide. Ceramide is transported to the Golgi where it is converted sequentially into the complex sphingolipids inositol-phosphoceramide, mannose-inositol-phosphoceramide, and finally to mannose-(inositol-phospho)2-ceramide. Complex sphingolipids are delivered to cellular compartments, particularly the plasma membrane (7Patton J.L. Lester R.L. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 3101-3108Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and to a lesser extent the vacuole (8Hechtberger P. Zinser E. Saf R. Hummel K. Paltauf F. Daum G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 225: 641-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). One of the distinguishing features of sphingolipids in S. cerevisiae is the C26 acyl group. Fatty acids with 20 or more carbons, very long chain fatty acids (VLCFAs), are ubiquitous in nature, but little is known about their functions. VLCFAs are mostly found in the ceramide portion of sphingolipids. The importance of the C26 acyl component of S. cerevisiae sphingolipids was demonstrated by the isolation of mutant strains that do not make sphingolipids (9Nagiec M.M. Wells G.B. Lester R.L. Dickson R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22156-22163Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), but instead make a set of novel sphingolipid mimics in which ceramide is replaced by diacyl-glycerol (10Lester R.L. Wells G.B. Oxford G. Dickson R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 845-856Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The presence of a C26 acyl group is the unique feature of these novel glycerolipids, which enables them to mimic some sphingolipid functions. Further evidence for the essentiality of the C26 acyl group in sphingolipids comes from studies of the FEN1 (ELO2) and SUR4 (ELO3) genes. In fen1Δ cells only 29% of the sphingolipids contain a C26 acyl group, the rest contain C22 and C24 acyl groups. The sphingolipids in sur4Δ cells contain only C22 and C24 acyl groups and no C26s (11Oh C.S. Toke D.A. Mandala S. Martin C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17376-17384Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar, 12Kohlwein S.D. Eder S. Oh C.S. Martin C.E. Gable K. Bacikova D. Dunn T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 109-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Fen1p and Sur4p are components of the enzyme system that elongates C16 and C18 fatty acids to form VLCFAs. The exact function of Fen1p and Sur4p are unclear because the elongation system has not been fully characterized in any organism. sur4Δ and fen1Δ cells are viable, although they have many mutant phenotypes (reviewed in Ref. 13Dickson R.C. Lester R.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1438: 305-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar) and deletion of both genes is lethal (14Revardel E. Bonneau M. Durrens P. Aigle M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1263: 261-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). A fraction of sphingolipids in higher eukaryotes also contain VLCFAs (15Downing D.T. J. Lipid Res. 1992; 33: 301-313Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and the mouse genes Ssc1 and Cig30 complement a sur4Δ and a fen1Δ mutant, respectively (16Tvrdik P. Westerberg R. Silve S. Asadi A. Jakobsson A. Cannon B. Loison G. Jacobsson A. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 707-718Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the mice mutants Quaking and Jimpy, which develop intense tremors at the age of about 2 weeks as a result of severe demyelination of the central nervous system, have reduced levels of Ssc1 mRNA and reduced fatty acid elongation activity (17Suneja S.K. Nagi M.N. Cook L. Cinti D.L. J. Neurochem. 1991; 57: 140-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Cig30 mRNA has the interesting property of being induced in brown adipose tissue when animals are exposed to cold temperature. These results suggest that VLCFAs are performing important, but unknown functions in mammals, and that some of these functions may be evolutionarily conserved. Recently Kohlwein et al. (12Kohlwein S.D. Eder S. Oh C.S. Martin C.E. Gable K. Bacikova D. Dunn T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 109-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar) reported that sur4Δ and fen1Δ cells contain small vacuoles called fragmented vacuoles that fail to properly fuse to form larger vacuoles. This observation suggested to us that sphingolipids with a C26 acyl group are needed for some vacuolar function(s). Here we show that V1 domains in sur4Δ cells lack ATPase activity even though they associate with V0 domains on the vacuolar membrane. Our data are the first to implicate sphingolipids with a C26 acyl group in the generation of a fully functional V1 domain. Strains, Plasmids, and Culture Conditions—Strains used in these experiments are listed in Table I. The sur4-Δ1::KAN and the fen1-Δ1::KAN alleles have codons 1–560 replaced with a kanamycin resistance cassette, generated by using the PCR and pUG6 as the template (18Guldener U. Heck S. Fiedler T. Beinhauer J. Hegemann J.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 2519-2524Crossref PubMed Scopus (1372) Google Scholar). Diploid cells transformed with deletion alleles were selected for G418 resistance (19Wach A. Yeast. 1996; 12: 259-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (705) Google Scholar). The expected deletion event was verified by PCR analysis of chromosomal DNA. Haploid offspring were obtained by sporulation and tetrad dissection. VMA13 under the control of its own promoter and having a Myc epitope immediately following the methionine start codon was carried in pRS316 (20Parra K.J. Keenan K.L. Kane P.M. J. Biol.

Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 384-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). YPD medium contained 1% yeast extract, 2% Bacto-peptone, and 2% dextrose. Quinacrine Staining and Semiquantitative Quinacrine Assay— Vacuolar accumulation of quinacrine was assessed by fluorescence microscopy as described by Roberts et al. (22Roberts C.J. Raymond C.K. Yamashiro C.T. Stenevs T.H. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 644-661Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar) or by a semiquantitative quinacrine assay (21Seol J.H. Shevchenko A. Shevchenko A. Deshaies R.J. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 384-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). Fluorescence measurements of cell suspensions were done in a Beckman spectrofluorometer (excitation = 419 nm, emission = 425 nm) and the OD at 600 nm was monitored in a spectrophotometer. SDS-PAGE, Immunoblotting, and Antibodies—SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting were performed according to procedures recommended for the Bio-Rad Tray-Blot S.D. Semi-Dry transfer cell (Bio-Rad Inc.). Monoclonal antibodies against Vph1p, Vma1p, Vma2p, CPY, and ALP were from Molecular Probes. Anit-Myc antibodies were from Roach Applied Science. Dr. Patricia Kane provided anti-Vma5p. Nitrocellulose membranes (Bio-Rad) were washed four times after the first and second antibody reactions with 0.1% phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.1% Triton X-100. Secondary antibody was anti-mouse IgG conjugated to alkaline phosphatase (Sigma). Membranes were incubated for 5 min facedown in ECF substrate (Amersham Biosciences) and fluorescent signals were collected by using a Molecular Dynamics Storm Phosphorimager and quantified by using ImageQuant software (version 5.1). HPLC Analysis of LCBs and LCBPs—Lipids were extracted from whole cells, converted to fluorescent derivatives and analyzed by HPLC as described previously (23Lester R.L. Dickson R.C. Anal. Biochem. 2001; 298: 283-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Treatment of Purified Vacuoles with PHS—A 100× stock of PHS (10 mm PHS in 95% EtOH) was diluted into a suspension of purified vacuolar membranes suspended in buffer (10 mm Tris, 10 mm MES, pH 6.9, 5 mm MgCl2, 25 mm KCl) to give a final concentration of 100 μm. Samples were incubated on ice for 0, 30, 60, 90, and 120 min followed by centrifugation at 13,000 rpm for 10 min in a microcentrifuge (4 °C). Proteins in the supernatant fluid were precipitated by incubating with 5% trichloroacetic acid (final concentration) for 2 h on ice. Pellets and trichloroacetic acid-precipitated proteins were resuspended in 50 μl of cracking buffer (8 m urea, 5% SDS, 1 mm ethylenediamine tetraacetate, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 5% β-mercaptoethanol, Ref. 24Kane P.M. Kuehn M.C. Howald-Stevenson I. Stevens T.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 447-454Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and equal volumes were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. Miscellaneous Procedures—Vacuolar membrane vesicles were purified by centrifugation on Ficoll gradients and Mg-ATPase activity was measured at 23 °C as described previously (22Roberts C.J. Raymond C.K. Yamashiro C.T. Stenevs T.H. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 644-661Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar) except that membranes were not homogenized before centrifugation on the second Ficoll gradient. Vacuolar membrane vesicles were also purified by sucrose density gradient centrifugation as previously described (25Leng X.H. Manolson M.F. Liu Q. Forgac M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22487-22493Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), except that the concentration of sucrose was increased to prevent membranes from pelleting on the bottom of the centrifuge tube. For these experiments, 4 ml of the membrane fraction was overlaid onto a 32-ml gradient composed of equal volumes of 10, 30, 50, and 60% (w/v) sucrose. The gradient was centrifuged for 35 min at 100,000 × g in a Sorvall AH629 rotor at 4 °C and then fractionated starting from the top into 9 fractions of 4, 7, 2, 6, 2, 6, 2, 7 ml and the resuspended pellet. Fractions were frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at –80 °C. V1V0 complexes on vacuolar membranes prepared by sucrose gradient centrifugation were dissociated by treatment with KI as described previously (26Puopolo K. Forgac M. J. Biol.

Cell-free protein extracts used for analysis of Vph1p (Fig. 3), were prepared as described by Kunz et al. (28Kunz J. Schneider U. Howald I. Schmidt A. Hall M.N. J. Biol.

Cell-free protein extracts used for the analysis Vma1p, Vma2p, and Vma5p were prepared as described (29Bagnat M. Keranen S. Shevchenko A. Simons K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 3254-3259Crossref PubMed Scopus (503) Google Scholar). To measure the calcium-dependent ATPase activity of cytosolic V1 domains, cells were grown, lysed and a high speed supernatant fraction was prepared as previously described (5Kane P.M. Parra K.J. J. Exp. Biol. 2000; 203 (Pt 1): 81-87Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Proteins were precipitated by treatment with 5% trichloroacetic acid as described above, resuspended in and dialyzed against buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm p-methylsulfonylfluoride, 10% glycerol), and centrifuged on a glycerol gradient (30Doherty R.D.

The pooled V1-containing fractions were assayed for calcium-dependent ATPase activity as described previously (5Kane P.M. Parra K.J. J. Exp. Biol. 2000; 203 (Pt 1): 81-87Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Values are expressed as the difference between assays performed with and without 1.6 mm CaCl2. The subunit composition (Fig. 7) of V0 and the V1V0 complex were analyzed by using a published procedure to cross-link proteins before immunoprecipitation and SDS-PAGE analysis (31Kane P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17025-17032Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The procedure was modified so that 1 OD of 600-nm units of spheroplasts were incubated with 50 μCi of Trans[35S] label (ICN Inc., 1175 Ci/mmol, 5100607). After pretreatment of the sample with protein A-Sepharose beads (Sigma Inc.), 400 μl a solution of 5% bovine serum albumin/phosphate-buffered saline containing 5 μl of antibody solution was added, and the sample was incubated overnight on ice with mixing. Protein A-Sepharose (40 μl of a 40% (v/v) suspension) was added to each sample and incubated for2honice with mixing. Immunoprecipitates were collected by centrifugation at 5,000 rpm for 5 min in a microcentrifuge. Pellets were washed four times in buffer (1% Triton X-100, 1% deoxycholic acid, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl), and precipitated proteins were eluted from the beads by incubation for 10 min at 95 °C in 50 μl of 4× SDS-loading buffer (50 mm Tris base, pH 6.8, 8% glycerol, 1.6% SDS, 4% β-mercaptoethanol, 0.04% bromphenol blue). Half of each precipitate was subjected to SDS-PAGE and phosphorimager analysis. Cells were prepared for indirect immunofluorescent microscopy by using a published procedure (22Roberts C.J. Raymond C.K. Yamashiro C.T. Stenevs T.H. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 644-661Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). The secondary antibody was goat anti-mouse IgG labeled with FluoroLink™ Cy3™ (Amersham Biosciences). Fluorescent images were obtained with a Nikon Àclipse E800 fluorescence microscope equipped with a Nikon 100X/1.3 plan fluor oil-immersion objective and a Diagnostic instruments Spot camera controlled by Adobe Photoshop software. For Cy3 fluorescence, samples were excited at 510–560 nm and viewed with a barrier filter of 570–650 nm. Adobe PhotoShop software was used to process images. Protein concentrations were determined with the Bio-Rad DC protein assay kit with bovine serum albumin as a standard. sur4Δ Cells Have a Unique Set of Vma – Phenotypes That Indicate Reduced V-ATPase Activity—The presence of fragmented vacuoles in sur4Δ cells suggests that the C26 acyl group of sphingolipids is necessary for some vacuolar function. Functional vacuoles require a proton pump or V-ATPase to acidify their lumen. When the V-ATPase is defective a set of phenotypes, referred to as Vma–, are produced. For example, vma mutants do not grow on YPD buffered to pH 7.5 (32Nelson H. Nelson N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 3503-3507Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar, 33Yamashiro C.T. Kane P.M. Wolczyk D.F. Preston R.A. Stevens T.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 3737-3749Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). We reasoned that sur4Δ cells might have Vma– phenotypes if sphingolipids containing a C26 acyl group are needed for V-ATPase activity. Indeed, we found that sur4Δ cells grow very poorly at pH 7.5 just like the authentic vma mutant vma2Δ (Fig. 1) (34Oluwatosin Y.E. Kane P.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 1534-1543Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). In contrast, fen1Δ cells grow better at pH 7.5 (Fig. 1), indicating that they are able to acidify their vacuoles more effectively than sur4Δ cells. Another Vma– phenotype is failure to grow on YPD plates containing 4 mm ZnCl2 (34Oluwatosin Y.E. Kane P.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 1534-1543Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). We found that sur4Δ cells have this phenotype whereas fen1Δ cells do not since they grow almost as well as wild-type cells (Fig. 1). Other Vma– phenotypes include failure to grow in the presence of 100 mm CaCl2 (35Ohya Y. Umemoto N. Tanida I. Ohta A. Iida H. Anraku Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 13971-13977Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or on medium containing a non-fermentable carbon source such as glycerol (36Foury F. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 18554-18560Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We found that 100 mm CaCl2 inhibits growth of sur4Δ cells but does not inhibit growth of fen1Δ cells (Fig. 1), again supporting the idea that sur4Δ cells are less able to acidify their vacuoles than fen1Δ cells. In addition, sur4Δ cells grow slowly on YP-glycerol while fen1Δ cells grow slightly faster and both grow better than vma2Δ control cells (Table II). These data show that the Vma– phenotypes of sur4Δ cells are nearly as pronounced as those in vma2Δ cells and that the phenotypes are less severe in fen1Δ cells. Based upon these phenotypes it appears that the V-ATPase is more impaired in sur4Δ cells than in fen1Δ cells.Table IIVma- phenotypes of sur4Δ and fen1Δ cellsMediumIncubationW303 & JK9-3dvma2Δsur4Δfen1ΔTemperaturedaysYPD30°C3++++aRelative growth rates are indicated by +/-, representing growth/no growth.+++++++YPD pH 7.530°C3++++--+YPD + 100mM CaCl230°C3++++-++++YPD + 4mM ZnCl230°C3++++--+++YP + 2% Glycerol30°C3+++-+++QuinacrinebVacuolar staining examined by fluorescent microscopy.25°C—+++--+a Relative growth rates are indicated by +/-, representing growth/no growth.b Vacuolar staining examined by fluorescent microscopy. Open table in a new tab To directly examine vacuolar acidification in vivo we used the lysosomotropic fluorescent dye quinacrine, which is taken up by cells and concentrated in acidified vacuoles; if vacuoles are not acidified the dye remains in the cytoplasm and gives a diffuse fluorescent signal (37Weisman L.S. Bacallao R. Wickner W. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 105: 1539-1547Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). A strong fluorescent vacuolar signal was observed in wild-type cells (Fig. 2A). No fluorescent signal was seen in sur4Δ cells, which behaved like vma2Δ control cells that do not acidify their vacuole. The fluorescent signal in fen1Δ cells was lower than in wild-type cells but greater than in sur4Δ cells. The fluorescent microscopy results were verified by a semiquantitative spectrofluorometric assay of the relative fluorescence of populations of cells stained with quinacrine. By this technique, wild-type cells fluoresced strongly whereas sur4Δ cells fluoresced near the background level measured in vma2Δ cells (Fig. 2 and Table II). The fluorescent signal in fen1Δ cells was 60% of the wild-type level indicating that they are able to acidify their vacuoles better than sur4Δ cells but not as well as wild-type cells. Taken together these data show that sur4Δ cells have a unique set of Vma– phenotypes and that they fail to acidify their vacuoles. These phenotypes are less severe in fen1Δ cells, which have some ability to acidify their vacuoles, although they do not acidify as well as wild-type cells. V-ATPase Activity Is Reduced in sur4Δ Cells and Ficoll Dissociates the V 1 V 0 Complex—The data presented in Figs. 1 and 2 and Table II suggest that vacuolar membranes isolated from sur4Δ cells should have less V-ATPase activity than vacuolar membranes isolated from fen1Δ cells and both should have less activity than those isolated from wild-type cells. In agreement with this prediction, vacuolar membranes isolated by Ficoll density gradient centrifugation from sur4Δ cells had only 10% of the wild-type V-ATPase activity while those isolated from fen1Δ cells had 25% of the wild-type activity (Table III).Table IIIV-ATPase activity in purified vacuolar membranesStrainFicoll gradientSucrose gradientV-ATPase activity% of wild typeV-ATPase activity% of wild typeμmol/min/mg protein aValues represent the ATPase activity that is sensitive to 200 nM Concanamycin A and are the means of two experiments ± the S.D.μmol/min/mg protein aValues represent the ATPase activity that is sensitive to 200 nM Concanamycin A and are the means of two experiments ± the S.D.Wild type0.69 ± 0.041000.76 ± 0.03100sur4Δ0.07 ± 0.03100.14 ± 0.0120fen1Δ0.17 ± 0.0125N.D.bN.D., not determined.a Values represent the ATPase activity that is sensitive to 200 nM Concanamycin A and are the means of two experiments ± the S.D.b N.D., not determined. Open table in a new tab Reduced V-ATPase activity could be due to either a reduced specific activity or fewer molecules. To differentiate between these alternatives the concentration of Vph1p, a subunit of the V0 domain, and Vma1p, Vma2p, and Vma5p, subunits of the V1 domain, were measured by immunoblotting of whole cell protein extracts and of purified vacuolar membranes (Fig. 3). Whole cell protein extracts from wild-type, sur4Δ, and fen1Δ mutants contained a similar level of each of the four proteins, indicating that the steady-state level of the proteins is similar in mutant and wild-type cells. Likewise, Vph1p was present in similar amounts in vacuolar membranes purified from the three strains. In contrast, the level of Vma1p Vma2p, and Vma5p in vacuolar membranes isolated from sur4Δ and fen1Δ cells was greatly reduced (Fig. 3). These results suggest that there is a defect in the V1 domain in sur4Δ and fen1Δ cells or that the interaction between V0 and V1 is abnormal and V1 or some of its subunits dissociate during vacuolar purification. The interaction of V1 with V0 has been examined by treating vacuolar membranes with a low salt buffer containing ethylenediamine tetraacetate and then determining if particular protein subunits remained in the vacuolar fraction (high speed pellet) or became soluble (38Ho M.N.

Because Ficoll purification removed V1 subunits from vacuolar membranes, we used cell-free extracts in place of vacuolar membranes for these assays. Treatment with a low salt buffer did not reveal any difference in the level of Vma1p and Vma2p in the pellet and soluble fractions obtained with sur4Δ, fen1Δ, or wild-type cells (data not shown). We also determined if increasing concentrations of sodium carbonate (38Ho M.N. Hirata R. Umemoto N. Ohya Y. Takatsuki A. Stevens T.H. Anraku Y. J. Biol.

Here we studied the mechanisms involved in IL-8 generation by BK in human airway smooth muscle cells focusing on the transcription factors involved and role of endogenous prostanoids in transcription factor activation. Transfection experiments with wild-type IL-8 promoter constructs or constructs with NF-κB, AP-1, and NF-IL-6 binding site mutations suggested that all three transcription factors were necessary for optimal IL-8 expression. BK increased NF-κB, AP-1, and NF-IL-6 binding to the IL-8 promoter by electrophoretic mobility shift assay. NF-κB, the most important transcription factor in the current study, was translocated to the nucleus after BK stimulation. Indomethacin, a cyclooxygenase inhibitor, partially inhibited IL-8 release and the promoter binding of AP-1 and NF-IL-6, but not NF-κB. Furthermore, exogenous prostaglandin E2 stimulated AP-1 and NF-IL-6 binding to the IL-8 promoter. The anti-inflammatory glucocorticoid dexamethasone inhibited NF-κB translocation and the promoter binding of NF-κB, AP-1, and NF-IL-6. These results are the first to delineate the transcription factors involved in BK induced IL-8 release. Transcriptional activation of the IL-8 promoter by BK involves the prostanoid-independent activation of NF-κB, and prostanoid-dependent activation of AP-1 and NF-IL-6 plays a key role in augmenting the response. Endogenous prostanoid generation in response to GPCR ligands such as BK may be an important mechanism whereby GPCRs signal to the nucleus to maximize the transcription of inflammatory response genes.

BK is also a potent vasodilator that plays an important role in regulating blood pressure in a several vascular beds (3Bhoola K.D. Figueroa C.D. Worthy K. Pharmacol. Rev. 1992; 44: 1-80PubMed Google Scholar). While some of the effects of BK occur directly, many of its effects are mediated by complex autocrine or paracrine loops involving intermediate factors such as prostaglandin or nitric oxide (4Bernier S.G.

Most of the biological effects of BK are mediated by the B2 receptor, a receptor of the seven-transmembrane G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family, which are capable of generating a broad spectrum of physiological responses. Increasing evidence suggests that G protein coupled receptors actively regulate transcription and gene expression events. This provides an effective means for local production of cytokines and growth factors because of the wide distribution of GPCR in various tissues and organs. Furthermore, GPCR may also synergize with cytokine mediated gene transcription. Although nuclear signaling by cytokines has been extensively studied there is a paucity of information on how GPCRs such as the BK receptor send signals to the nucleus. Recent evidence suggests that BK may actively regulate transcription and gene expression events through activation of the transcription factor nuclear factor κB (NF-κB), but the downstream targets for BK-mediated NF-κB activation have not been extensively studied (8Pan Z.K.

Whether other transcription factors are also activated by BK and which genes they activate is also poorly understood. IL-8, first isolated from monocytes as a neutrophil chemoattractant, is an 8.5-kDa C-X-C chemokine that is also chemotactic for T lymphocytes, monocytes, and eosinophils. IL-8 plays a major role in the initiation and maintenance of inflammatory responses (10Baggiolini M. Dewald B. Moser B. Adv. Immunol. 1994; 55: 97-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (2259) Google Scholar). IL-8 also functions as an angiogenic factor and may contribute to angiogenesis, a prominent feature of the histopathology of several inflammatory diseases such as asthma, rheumatoid disease, and inflammatory bowel disease (11Hu D.E. Hori Y. Fan T.P. Inflammation. 1993; 17: 135-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar, 12Koch A.E. Polverini P.J. Kunkel S.L. Harlow L.A. DiPietro L.A. Elner V.M. Elner S.G. Strieter R.M.

Our studies and others in recent years have advanced the paradigm that human airway smooth muscle (HASM) has important synthetic functions in asthma and is a rich source of cytokines, chemokines, inflammatory mediators, and growth factors, which contribute to the inflammatory process and airway remodeling (13Johnson S.R.

However, of greater interest was the finding that BK, a non-cytokine mediator, could also cause IL-8 release as this was the first report that BK could do so in any biological system (23Pang L. Knox A.J. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 2509-2515PubMed Google Scholar). Subsequent studies have shown that BK can also cause IL-8 release by epithelial and fibroblast cells (24Hayashi R. Yamashita N. Matsui S. Maruyama M. Sugiyama E. Sugiyama S. Kobayashi M. Immunology. 1998; 95: 507-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). There are various motifs within the 5′-flanking region of the human IL-8 promoter with the potential to bind a number of important transcription factors in a cell and stimulus-dependent manner. Although other stimuli can regulate at both transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels, there is little information on the transcriptional and post-transcriptional mechanisms used by BK or other GPCR ligands. Here we study the transcriptional mechanisms involved in IL-8 production in response to BK in HASM cells. We report that the transcription factors NF-κB, AP-1, and NF-IL-6 are all involved in IL-8 induction by BK. Activation of AP-1 and NF-κB was prostanoid-dependent, as it was mimicked by exogenous PGE2 and inhibited by indomethacin, a cyclooxygenase (COX) inhibitor. In contrast activation of NF-κB occurred mainly via prostanoid-independent pathways. The glucocorticoid dexamethasone suppressed BK-induced IL-8 production by inhibiting binding of NF-κB, AP-1, and NF-IL-6 to the IL-8 promoter. Cell Culture—HASM cells were purchased from BioWhittaker. Cells at passages 4 to 6 were used for all experiments. The cells were cultured to 90% confluence in 10% fetal calf serum (Harlan Seralab, Loughborough, Leicestershire, UK)-Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Sigma, Poole, Dorset, UK) in humidified 5% CO2, 95% air at 37 °C and growth arrested in fetal calf serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium for 24 h before the experiments. Immediately before each experiment, fresh fetal calf serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing BK was added. The culture media were harvested at the indicated times and stored at –20 °C before analysis by IL-8 ELISA. The cells were collected for extraction of protein or mRNA. RNA Isolation and Reverse Transcriptase-Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR)—After the cells in the 6-well plates were treated with BK at a final concentration of 1 μm, cells were collected at time 0, 0.5, 2, 4, and 8 h, respectively. Total RNA was isolated by using the RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen, West Sussex, UK) following the manufacturer's protocol. 1 μg of total RNA was reverse-transcribed in a total volume of 20 μl, including 200 units of Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Promega, Madison, WI), 25 units of RNase inhibitor (Promega), 0.5 μg of oligo(dT)15 primer, a 0.5 mm concentration of each dNTP, 1× first-strand buffer provided by Promega. The reaction was incubated at 42 °C for 90 min. Aliquots of the RT products were subsequently used for PCR amplification. 10 μl of RT products was brought to a volume of 50 μl containing 1 mm MgCl2, a 0.12 mm concentration of each dNTP, 1 unit of Taq polymerase (Sigma), a 0.5 μm concentration of both the upstream and downstream PCR primers, 1× PCR buffer provided by Sigma. Two pairs of primers were used for this study. The primer sequences were as follows: IL-8 sense, 5′-ATG ACT TCC AAG CTG GCC GTG GCT-3′; IL-8 antisense, 5′-TCT CAG CCC TCT TCA AAA ACT TCT C-3′; GAPDH sense, 5′-CCA CCC ATG GCA AAT TCC ATG GCA-3′; GAPDH antisense, 5′-TCT AGA CGG CAG GTC AGG TCC ACC-3′. Amplification was carried out in Techne PHC-3 thermal cycler (Cambridge, Cambridgshire, UK) after an initial denaturation at 94 °C for 3 min. This was followed by 35 cycles of PCR using the following temperature and time profile: denaturation at 94 °C for 1 min, primer annealing at 56 °C for 1 min, primer extension at 72 °C for 1 min, and a final extention of 72 °C for 10 min. The PCR products were visualized by eletrophoresis on 1% of agarose gel in 0.5× TBE buffer (89 mm Tris borate, 2 mm EDTA, pH 8.3) after staining with 0.5 μg/ml ethidium bromide. The ultraviolet (UV)-illuminated gels were photographed, and the densitometry was analyzed by GeneGenius gel documentation and analysis system (Syngene, Cambridge, Cambridgshire, UK). IL-8 Assay—IL-8 concentrations in the culture medium were determined by ELISA (CLB, Amsterdam, Netherlands) according to the manufacturer's instructions, and we have reported the method in detail elsewhere (23Pang L. Knox A.J. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 2509-2515PubMed Google Scholar). Vectors and Transfections—The vectors encoding either the wild-type IL-8 promoter (–162/+44)/luciferase reporter, or site mutations of one of the binding sites (AP-1, NF-IL-6, or NF-κB) in the IL-8 promoter region were kindly provided by A. R. Braiser (Department of Medicine, Sealy Center for Molecular Science, Galveston, TX). The constructs were described in detail in the publications from Braiser's laboratory (25Brasier A.R.

Vlahopoulos S. Brasier A.R. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 5944-5951Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). HASMC were co-transfected using LipofectAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen) with one of these vectors and control vector (pRL-TK, Promega) for 4 h, then cultured in fresh serum for a further 16 h before the BK treatment for 60 min. The efficiency of transfection by LipofectAMINE 2000 was 22%. The cells were then collected and lysed. Firefly and Renilla luciferase activities were measured by luminometer using the dual-luciferase reporter assay system (Promega). The normalized luciferase activities were calculated by dividing firefly activities by Renilla activities. Western Blotting—Nuclear and cytoplasmic extracts from stimulated (by BK) or untreated control cells were prepared by Nu-Clear extraction kit (Sigma) following the manufacturer's protocol before Western blot analysis to measure NF-κB expression. Protein was extracted by incubating the cells for 5 min with 300 μl/well protein extraction buffer (0.9% NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 0.1% Triton X-100, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 0.01% leupeptin; all from Sigma) and shaking gently. The protein extraction buffer was then harvested and stored at –20 °C for subsequent Western blot analysis. The protein concentration of cell extracts was determined with the Bio-Rad protein assay reagent (Bio-Rad, Hemel Hempstead, UK). Sufficient aliquots of sample (30 μg of protein/track) were mixed 5:1 with 5× sample buffer and boiled for 5 min before electrophoresis. Electrophoresis was performed on these samples on a SDS-polyacrylamide gel (100 V, 1 h). The separated proteins were then electroblotted (100 V, 1 h) to pure nitrocellulose membrane (Gelman Sciences, Northampton, UK). The blot was blocked for 2 h at 4 °C in blocking reagent (5% fat-free dried milk powder in PBS, pH 7.4, with 0.3% Tween 20 (PBS-T), incubated with primary polyclonal anti-human IκB-α antibody (1:2,000) (Santa Cruz) or polyclonal anti-human NF-κB antibody (1:2000) (Santa Cruz) for 2 h at room temperature before being washed with PBS-T and incubated with goat anti-rabbit antibody coupled with horseradish peroxidase (1:5,000) for 1 h at room temperature. Enhanced chemiluminescence detection was performed by washing the blot with PBS-T, incubating it with the SuperSignal CL-HRP substrate system (Pierce) for 1 min, and finally exposing it to Hyperfilm ECL (Amersham Biosciences, Little Chalfont, Bucks, UK). Immunofluorescence—HASM cells were seeded and cultured on coverslips. After the HASM cells were treated by BK, the cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 30 min at room temperature, washed three times in PBS (10 min each), permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100 for 10 min, and then washed again three times in PBS. Following fixation and permeabilization, each coverslip was incubated with 500 μl of blocking solution (1.5% goat serum in PBS) for 1 h at room temperature in a box to block nonspecific binding. 500 μl of diluted rabbit anti-human NF-κB (1:200 dilution, Santa Cruz) antibody with blocking solution was added to each coverslip. Coverslips were incubated for 1 h at room temperature in a box and were then washed three times with PBS. Fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody were diluted 1:160 in blocking solution, and 500 μl of diluted antibody was incubated with each coverslip for 1 h at room temperature. Coverslips were washed three times with PBS. Mounting onto slides with Vectashield mounting medium (Vector Laboratories, Inc., Burlingam, CA). Fluorescence was observed and photographed on an Olympus BX40 microscope. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay (EMSA)—The nuclear fractions for EMSA were prepared using Nu-Clear extraction kit (Sigma) following the manufacturer's protocol. Protein concentrations of nuclear fractions were determined using the Bio-Rad protein assay. Oligonucleotides containing the NF-κB/IL-8 (TCG TGG AAT TTC CTC TG), AP-1/IL-8 (GTG TGA TGA CTC AGG TTT G), and NF-IL-6/IL-8 (GCC ATC AGT TGC AAA TCG T) sequences were labeled using [γ-32P]ATP (Amersham Biosciences) and T4 polynucleotide kinase (Promega). Fifteen micrograms of nuclear fractions, 40,000 counts/min labeled double-stranded probe, and 2 μl of 5× binding buffer (20% glycerol, 5 mm MgCl2, 2.5 mm EDTA, 2.5 mm dithiothreitol, 250 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.25 mg/ml poly(dI-dC)·poly(dI-dC)) were mixed in a total volume of 10 μl. In competition assays, 100× unlabeled competitors were added at the same time of probe addition. In supershift analyses, 2 μl (2 μg/μl) of antibodies such as anti-p65, anti-p50, anti-c-Fos, and anti-NF-IL-6 were added to the reaction. The mixture was incubated at room temperature for 30 min, then loaded on a 4% polyacrylamide gel in 0.5× TBE buffer, and subjected to electrophoresis for 60 min. The gel was dried and exposed for autoradiography on Kodak XAR film at –70 °C for 1–2 days. Statistical Analysis—Results were expressed as the mean ± S.E. from n determinations. Student two-tailed t tests were used to determine the significant differences between the means. Values of p < 0.05 were accepted as statistically significant. BK Causes Release of IL-8 Protein and an Increase in IL-8 mRNA—As previously reported by our group (23Pang L. Knox A.J. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 2509-2515PubMed Google Scholar), HASM cells release IL-8 after BK stimulation. We chose a concentration of 10 μm of BK for our present experiments as our previous studies showed that this concentration causes maximal IL-8 release. In time course experiments, IL-8 was detected at a low level (25 pg/ml) as early as 4 h after BK and reached a peak (237 pg/ml) at 16 h (Fig. 1A). IL-8 mRNA was increased 5-fold 2 h after BK, 7-fold at 4 h, reduced to 2.5-fold after 6 h, and returned to basal levels after 8 h (Fig. 1B). To reveal whether the induction resulting from IL-8 gene transcription or post-transcriptional stabilization of IL-8 mRNA, we carried out transcriptional blockade studies. The RNA polymerase II inhibitor actinomycin D (10 μg/ml) was added to HASM cell culture 2 h after BK stimulation. The IL-8 mRNA level were analyzed by RT-PCR after 1, 2, 3, and 4 h of actinomycin D treatment and compared. After addition of actinomycin D for 2 h, only half of IL-8 mRNA (2.2-fold to basal level) was left (Fig. 1C). In contrast, IL-8 mRNA increased progressively to its peak level (7-fold) if no actinomycin D was added. In studies where no BK was added prior to actinomycin D treatment the half-life of IL-8 mRNA was similar (Fig. 1D), suggesting that BK is not acting by post-transcriptional modification of IL-8 transcripts. Mutations in the NF-κB, AP-1, and NF-IL-6 Binding Sites in the IL-8 Promoter Reduce BK-stimulated Luciferase Activity—To determine whether BK was acting transcriptionally and to probe the transcription elements involved in IL-8 induction, vectors containing the wild-type IL-8 promoter or mutations of binding sites for either AP-1, NF-IL-6, or NF-κB in the IL-8 promoter were co-transfected into HASM cells with the control vector pRL-TK. There was no significant difference in basal promoter activity. After BK stimulation, luciferase activity was increased 2.7-fold in cells transfected with the wild-type IL-8 promoter, suggesting that BK was acting transcriptionally. In contrast, luciferase activities were only increased to 2.1 (22% reduction compared with wt, p < 0.05), 2.0 (26% reduction, p < 0.05), and 1.4 (49% reduction, p < 0.05)-fold when the cells were transfected by vectors containing site mutations of AP-1, NF-IL-6, and NF-κB, respectively (Fig. 2). This suggests that all three factors are necessary for maximum IL-8 induction by BK. Nuclear Translocation of Transcription Factors—To detect NF-κB nuclear translocation, cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions were isolated and separated by SDS-PAGE gel and the membrane was probed with anti-NF-κB antibody (p65). We found that under resting condition NF-κB was located in the cytoplasmic fraction, but was translocated to the nucleus after BK treatment for 30 min (Fig. 3A). In parallel IκB, an inhibitor of NF-κB, was degraded in the cytoplasm as shown in Fig. 3A. NF-κB translocation was also confirmed by immunofluorescence (Fig. 3B). In contrast, AP-1 and NF-IL-6 were located in the nuclei under resting conditions (data not shown). This is consistent with other studies showing that NF-IL-6 and AP-1 can be activated by phosphorylation in the nucleus rather than translocation. BK Increases NF-κB, AP-1, and NF-IL-6 Binding to the IL-8 Promoter—We next used EMSA to examine whether the transcription factors bind to the IL-8 promoter after BK stimulation. We found that NF-κB started to bind to the IL-8 promoter at 20 min after BK stimulation and reached a peak at 60 min (Fig. 4A). The binding was completely abolished by adding a 100-fold excess of cold NF-κB oligonucleotides to the reaction, but not by adding a 100-fold excess of cold nonspecific oligonucleotides (AP-1) (Fig. 4C). Supershift analyses were performed with nuclear extracts by adding 4 μg of specific antibodies against p65 and p50. Both antibodies effectively supershifted the protein-DNA complex (Fig. 4B). These results indicated that the binding was specific. AP-1 and NF-IL-6 also strongly bound to the IL-8 promoter at 60 min after BK stimulation (Fig. 4, D and E). Similarly, competition experiments with cold oligonucleotides and supershifts showed that the binding was specific. Dexamethasone Inhibits IL-8 Induction by BK—Glucocorticoids are major regulators of inflammatory processes that act by regulating inflammatory gene transcription. We performed experiments to determine whether glucocorticoids would inhibit BK induced IL-8 release. We found that pretreatment with the glucocorticoid dexamethasone, at a concentration of 1 μm for 30 min before BK, completely abolished BK-induced IL-8 release (p < 0.001) (Fig. 5A). We then examined the mechanism of the inhibition by dexamethasone using EMSA. We found that dexamethasone prevented the binding of all three transcription factors (NF-κB, AP-1, and NF-IL-6) to the IL-8 promoter (Fig. 5B). We further detected that NF-κB was reduced significantly in the nucleus, and IκB-α was induced with dexamethasone pretreatment (Fig. 5C). Dexamethasone also abolished the increased luciferase activity induced by BK when HASM cells were transfected by wild-type IL-8 promoter (p < 0.01). Exogenous PGE 2 Causes Activation of the IL-8 Promoter—As we have previously shown that autocrine PGE2 release plays a role as an intermediary factor in BK-induced IL-8 generation, we first measured IL-8 by ELISA after HASM cells treated with exogenous PGE2. IL-8 was detected at significant levels (200 and 290 pg/ml) when the cells were treated by exogenous PGE2 at concentrations of 1 and 10 μm (Fig. 6A). We also determined whether exogenous PGE2 could increase in IL-8 transcription. RT-PCR showed IL-8 mRNA induction when HASM cells were stimulated by exogenous PGE2. IL-8 mRNA was increased 6-fold 2 h after PGE2 treatment (10 μm), 5-fold at 4 h, and reduced to 3-fold after 6 h (Fig. 6B). Furthermore exogenous PGE2 increased the activity of IL-8 promoter constructs when vectors containing the wild-type IL-8 promoter or mutations of each binding site were transfected into HASM cells followed by PGE2 stimulation, luciferase activity was increased to 2.8-fold in cells transfected with the wild-type IL-8 promoter. In contrast, luciferase activities were only increased to 1.5 (46% reduction compared with wild-type, p < 0.05), 2.1 (25% reduction, p < 0.05), and 1.4 (50% reduction, p < 0.05)-fold when the cells were transfected by vectors containing site mutations of AP-1, NF-IL-6, and NF-κB, respectively (Fig. 6C). A protein-DNA binding study by EMSA showed that AP-1, NF-IL-6, and NF-κB also bound to IL-8 promoter after PGE2 stimulation (Fig. 6D). Indomethacin Inhibits IL-8 Induction by BK—To probe the role of exogenous PGE2 on BK induced IL-8 transcription, we next studied the effect of indomethacin, a COX inhibitor, on IL-8 release and transcription factor binding to the IL-8 promoter in response to BK. Indomethacin partially inhibited the BK-induced IL-8 release at a concentration of 1 μm of indomethacin, IL-8 release was reduced to 46% (p < 0.01). At a higher concentration (10 μm), IL-8 release was reduced to 26% (p < 0.01). However, this reduction was rescued by adding exogenous PGE2 (p < 0.01) (Fig. 7A). In EMSA studies, indomethacin (10 μm) interrupted the binding of AP-1 and NF-IL-6. However, the interruption was reversed after exogenous PGE2 was added. Interestingly, indomethacin did not affect NF-κB binding (Fig. 7B). Indomethacin (10 μm) also markedly reduced the increased luciferase activity induced by BK when HASM cells were transfected by wild-type IL-8 promoter (p < 0.01), but the effect was rescued by exogenous PGE2 (10 μm) (p < 0.05) (Fig. 7D). A similar result was obtained when the cells were treated by dexamethasone consistent with the effect of dexamethasone being partially due to inhibition of PGE2 production. These results indicated that endogenous PGE2 was acting in the main via AP-1 and NF-IL-6. We further detected that NF-κB was not reduced in the nucleus, and IκB-α was not induced with indomethacin pretreatment (Fig. 7C).Fig. 8Schematic representation of ways in which PGE2 partly mediated IL-8 induction by BK and the possible pathway blocked by dexamethasone (Dex) and indomethacin (Indo).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The major finding of this study was that BK induced IL-8 release transcriptionally through the combined activation of NF-κB, AP-1, and NF-IL-6 and that interaction between prostanoid-dependent and -independent processes played a key role in this process. Mutation studies of the IL-8 promoter showed that all three transcription factor binding sites were required for optimal promoter activity. Furthermore, EMSA studies showed that all three transcription factors bound to the IL-8 promoter after BK stimulation. Binding of AP-1 and NF-IL-6 to the IL-8 promoter by BK was inhibited by indomethacin and mimicked by PGE2 suggests that it was prostanoid dependent. Indomethacin was not effective at inhibiting NF-κB translocation and did not influence NF-κB binding to the IL-8 promoter as assessed by EMSA, suggesting that NF-κB is activated mainly through prostanoid independent mechanisms in response to BK. Dexamethasone, the anti-inflammatory glucocorticoid, abolished both IL-8 release in response to BK and the binding of the three transcription factors to the IL-8 promoter. There are several novel aspects to these studies. They are the first to show that these transcriptional factors are involved in IL-8 release to bradykinin. We show for the first time that PGE2 acts as an autocrine intermediary factor in activating AP-1 and NF-IL-6 in response to BK. IL-8 protein levels accumulated to a peak at 16 h with no further increase at 24 h. This is consistent with the increase in IL-8 mRNA, which was maximal at 4 h, reflecting the delay in protein synthesis. The fact that mRNA was reducing after 4 h but protein did not show a drop reflects the stability of IL-8 protein. IL-8 mRNA was reduced by actinomycin D, suggesting it was mainly dependent on gene transcription. Consistent with this, transfection studies with wild-type IL-8 promoter luciferase reporter constructs showed that BK increased luciferase activity. We subsequently defined the main transcription factors involved. We found that BK induced NF-κB translocation to the nucleus, that NF-κB binding to the IL-8 promoter was increased by BK, and that IL-8 promoter constructs with the NF-κB site mutated had negligible promoter activity. This suggests that NF-κB is the major transcription factor involved in BK stimulated IL-8 release. Other studies have shown that BK can induce NF-κB activation in the lung fibroblast cell line WI-38 and in cultured human epithelial cells (8Pan Z.K. Ye R.D. Christiansen S.C. Jagels M.A. Bokoch G.M. Zuraw B.L. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 3038-3045PubMed Google Scholar, 27Pan Z.K. Zuraw B.L. Lung C.C. Prossnitz E.R. Browning D.D. Ye R.D. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 98: 2042-2049Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar), but the downstream targets of NF-κB activation have not been extensively studied. We have therefore extended these studies to show that NF-κB binds to the IL-8 promoter and regulates IL-8 release in HASM cells. We demonstrated translocation of NF-κB using both Western blotting and immunofluorescence. Consistent with this we found evidence of IκBα degradation in response to BK. IκBα is the inhibitory cytosolic protein bound to NF-κB, and its degradation is a key step in NF-κB activation. This process is initiated through signal-induced phosphorylation of two serines (Ser32 and Ser36) on the IκBα molecule. The phosphorylation event in turn induces polyubiquitination of IκBα on lysines 21 and 22. Phosphorylated and ubiquitinated IκBα can be rapidly recognized and degraded by proteasome, a multiprotease complex (28Chen Z. Hagler J. Palombella V.J. Melandri F. Scherer D. Ballard D. Maniatis T. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1586-1597Crossref PubMed Scopus (1163) Google Scholar). Our results showed that IκBα was nearly completely degraded at 30 min after BK stimulation. NF-κB could thus translocate to the nucleus and activate IL-8 gene transcription. Our transfection studies with mutant AP-1 and NF-IL-6 IL-8 promoter constructs in HASM cells showed that BK-induced luciferase activities were reduced significantly compared with wild type vector for both mAP-1 and mNF-IL-6, suggesting that both of these transcription factors are involved in IL-8 transcription by BK. This was supported by the EMSA results where BK induced strong AP-1 and NF-IL-6 binding to the IL-8 promoter. Although BK has previously been shown to activate NF-κB, ours are the first studies to show that NF-IL-6 can be activated by BK. BK has previously been shown to activate AP-1 in HEK cells (29Naraba H. Ueno A. Kosugi Y. Yoshimura M. Murakami M. Kudo I. Oh-ishi S. FEBS Lett. 1998; 435: 96-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), but as with NF-κB, the downstream targets have not been identified. Our work extends these studies to show that IL-8 is a major downstream target. As we have previously shown that BK-induced IL-8 release is partially dependent on the generation of endogenous PGE2, we performed studies to determine the role of PGE2 in the transcriptional regulation of IL-8 by BK. We found that indomethacin, a COX inhibitor, caused a concentration dependent inhibition of IL-8 release. We have previously shown that BK increases PGE2 levels and that this concentration of indomethacin abolishes it (31Pang L. Knox A.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: L1132-L1140Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, indomethacin abolished the binding of NF-IL-6 and AP-1 to the IL-8 promoter in EMSA studies, suggesting that BK-induced activation of NF-IL-6 and AP-1 is prostanoid-dependent. Consistent with this exogenous PGE2 the major COX metabolite of HASM cells increased binding of NF-IL-6 and AP-1 to the IL-8 promoter. Furthermore, PGE2 increased the activity of exogenous wild-type IL-8 promoter reporters, which was reduced in AP-1 and NF-IL-6 mutations. These assertions were further supported by rescue experiments using exogenous PGE2. Although exogenous PGE2 also activated NF-κB and NF-κB mutation reduced PGE2-induced IL-8 promoter reporter activity, indomethacin did not reduce NF-κB binding to the IL-8 promoter or nuclear translocation of NF-κB, suggesting that BK-induced NF-κB activation can occur through both prostanoid-dependent and -independent mechanisms and that when endogenous PGE2 is blocked by indomethacin, prostanoid-independent actions can still produce maximal NF-κB binding to the IL-8 promoter. We then went on to study the effect of the anti-inflammatory glucocorticoid dexamethasone on BK-induced IL-8 release and transcription factor binding. We found that dexamethasone suppressed BK-induced IL-8 production and inhibited binding of NF-κB, AP-1, and NF-IL-6 to the IL-8 promoter, suggesting that the effect was mediated through inhibition of NF-κB, AP-1, and NF-IL-6. These results might explain why dexamethasone completely abolished the IL-8 induction by BK. The effect of dexamethasone on NF-κB appeared to be via inhibition of its translocation to the nucleus. This is similar to studies in osteoarthritic synovial tissue in which dexamethasone reduced TNF-stimulated NF-κB translocation and its binding (30Lehmann T. Murphy C. Zahra D.G. Handel M.L. J. Rheumatol. 2002; 29: 787-795PubMed Google Scholar). As we have previously shown that dexamethasone markedly inhibits COX-2 mediated PGE2 generation by BK (31Pang L. Knox A.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: L1132-L1140Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), it is likely that the effects of dexamethasone are partly mediated by inhibition of PGE2 generation and partly by inhibition of NF-κB translocation, and consistent with this, exogenous PGE2 partially rescued the reduction in wild-type IL-8 luciferase activity caused by dexamethasone. There are two types of BK receptors, B1 and B2, which are members of the seven-transmembrane GPCR superfamily. We have previously shown that BK induces IL-8 release via the B2 receptor (23Pang L. Knox A.J. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 2509-2515PubMed Google Scholar). Recently studies showed that signaling via a variety of GPCRs can lead to activation of NF-κB. BK-mediated NF-κB activation proceeds from the receptor through Gq, which leads to phosphoinositide 3-kinase and Akt activation, and ultimately to the IκB (9Xie P. Browning D.D. Hay N. Mackman N. Ye R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24907-24914Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Furthermore PYK2 activation can lead to NF-κB activation and, through phosphoinositide 3-kinase, Akt, and IκB, to NF-κB activation (32Shi C.S. Kehrl J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 31845-31850Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Further studies are required to identify the complete signaling pathway linking the B2 receptor to other transcription factors such as NF-IL-6 and AP-1. In conclusion, we have delineated the transcription factors responsible for IL-8 release by HASM in response to BK. Our studies suggest that NF-κB is the major transcription factor involved but that AP-1 and NF-IL-6 also contribute. PGE2 acts as an autocrine intermediatory factor to active AP-1 and NF-IL-6, whereas NF-κB is activated via both prostanoid-dependent and -independent mechanisms. These studies increase our understanding of the mechanisms whereby seven-transmembrane GPCR ligands such as BK contribute to inflammatory diseases.

Transgenic mice overexpressing a mutant gene for β-amyloid precursor protein (APP) show behavioral and histopathological abnormalities resembling AD and, therefore, were used as an AD model. Application of the mAChR agonist carbachol significantly increased the spontaneous inhibitory postsynaptic current (sIPSC) frequency and amplitude in PFC pyramidal neurons from wild-type animals. In contrast, carbachol failed to increase the sIPSC amplitude in APP transgenic mice, whereas the carbachol-induced increase of the sIPSC frequency was not significantly changed in these mutants. Similar results were obtained in rat PFC slices pretreated with the β-amyloid peptide (Aβ). Inhibiting protein kinase C (PKC) blocked the carbachol enhancement of sIPSC amplitudes, implicating the PKC dependence of this mAChR effect. In APP transgenic mice, carbachol failed to activate PKC despite the apparently normal expression of mAChRs.

Several prominent features consistently found in AD patients include: degeneration of basal forebrain cholinergic neurons and ensuing deficient cholinergic functions in cortex and hippocampus, extracellular protein aggregates containing β-amyloid peptides (Aβ) in these cholinergic target areas, and impairments in mental functions that are characterized by the loss of memory (1Whitehouse P.J.

Drugs that antagonize mAChRs worsen the performance of human subjects and animals in learning and memory tasks (8Coyle J.T. Price D.L. DeLong M.R.

Despite the discovery of correlation between cholinergic hypofunction and AD, the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying the function and dysfunction of mAChRs in normal cognition and dementia remain elusive. Prefrontal cortex (PFC), one of the major target areas of basal forebrain cholinergic neurons, has long been associated with high-level, “executive” processes (12Miller E.K. Neuron. 1999; 22: 15-17Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar), particularly a form of short term information storage described as “working memory” (13Goldman-Rakic P.S. Neuron. 1995; 14: 477-485Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1870) Google Scholar). The cholinergic activity in frontal cortex is persistently increased in mice performing a working memory task (14Durkin T.P. Neuroscience. 1994; 62: 681-693Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). All the five subtypes of mAChRs, m1–m5 (15Bonner T.I. Buckley N.J. Young A.C. Brann M.R. Science. 1987; 237: 527-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (1220) Google Scholar), are expressed in cortical pyramidal neurons (16Levey A.I. Kitt C.A. Simonds W.F. Price D.L. Brann M.R. J. Neurosci. 1991; 11: 3218-3226Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 17Stewart A.E. Yan Z. Surmeier D.J. Foehring R.C. J. Neurophysiol. 1999; 81: 72-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 18Ma X.H. Zhong P. Gu Z. Feng J. Yan Z. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 1159-1168Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). One of the important questions yet to be answered is the targets of muscarinic signaling that are involved in cognition and memory. Recent studies show that GABAergic inhibition in frontal cortex controls the timing of neuronal activities during cognitive processes, therefore, shaping the flow of information in cortical circuits (19Constantinidis C. Williams G.V. Goldman-Rakic P.S. Nat. Neurosci. 2002; 5: 175-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). The critical involvement of cortical muscarinic signaling in cognition and AD, combined with the central role of GABAergic inhibition in working memory, prompts us to hypothesize that the GABA system might be a key cellular substrate for muscarinic signaling in cognition and memory, and its dysregulation by mAChRs in AD might contribute to the cognitive impairment. Emerging evidence suggests that low concentrations of Aβ peptides can potently inhibit various cholinergic neurotransmitter functions independently of concurrent neurotoxicity (20Auld D.S. Kar S. Quirion R. Trends Neurosci. 1998; 21: 43-49Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Aβ peptides are produced by proteolytic cleavage of the β-amyloid precursor protein (APP) (21Selkoe D.J. Trends Cell Biol. 1998; 8: 447-453Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (805) Google Scholar). Most of the mutations in the APP gene are clustered around the cleavage sites, which increases the rate of cleavage, thereby generating more Aβ (22Selkoe D.J. J. Biol.

Transgenic mice overexpressing mutant APP genes exhibit AD-like symptoms, including increased Aβ deposits and deficits in spatial learning and memory (24Games D. Adams D. Alessandrini R. Barbour R.

In this study, we used this AD model to examine the muscarinic regulation of GABAergic synaptic transmission in PFC pyramidal projection neurons. An AD Model—Transgenic mice carrying the human APP 695 with the double mutation K670N and M671L (Swedish mutation) were created as described previously (25Hsiao K. Chapman P. Nilsen S. Eckman C. Harigaya Y. Younkin S. Yang F. Cole G. Science. 1996; 274: 99-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (3700) Google Scholar). Eight-week-old transgenic males (on B6SJLF1 hybrid background) were bred with mature B6SJLF1 females. Genetic background of these mice is the same with this breeding scheme. Genotyping were performed by PCR. Male transgenic (1–2 months old) and age-matched wild-type littermates were used in the experiments. Electrophysiological Recordings in Slices—Young adult rat or mouse slices containing PFC were prepared as described previously (27Feng J. Cai X. Zhao J. Yan Z. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 6502-6511Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 28Cai X. Flores-Hernandez J. Feng J. Yan Z. J. Phyisol. 2002; 540: 743-759Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). All experiments were carried out with the approval of State University of New York at Buffalo Animal Care Committee. In brief, animals were anesthetized by inhaling 2-bromo-2-chloro-1,1,1-trifluoroethane (1 ml/100 g, Sigma) and decapitated, and brains were quickly removed, iced, and then blocked for slicing. The blocked tissue was cut in 300–400-μm slices with a Vibrotome while bathed in a low Ca2+ (100 μm), HEPES-buffered salt solution (in mm: 140 sodium isethionate, 2 KCl, 4 MgCl2, 0.1 CaCl2, 23 glucose, 15 HEPES, 1 kynurenic acid, pH = 7.4, 300–305 mosm/liter). Slices were then incubated for 1–6 h at room temperature (20–22 °C) in a NaHCO3-buffered saline bubbled with 95% O2, 5% CO2 (in mm): 126 NaCl, 2.5 KCl, 2 CaCl2, 2 MgCl2, 26 NaHCO3, 1.25 NaH2PO4, 10 glucose, 1 pyruvic acid, 0.05 glutathione, 0.1 N G-nitro-l-arginine, 1 kynurenic acid, pH = 7.4, 300–305 mosm/liter. To evaluate the regulation of spontaneous IPSCs by muscarinic receptors in PFC slices, the whole-cell patch technique was used for voltage-clamp recordings using patch electrodes (5–9 MΩ) filled with the following internal solution (in mm): 100 CsCl, 30 N-methyl-d-glucamine, 10 HEPES, 1 MgCl2, 4 NaCl, 5 EGTA, 12 phosphocreatine, 2 MgATP, 0.2 Na3GTP, 0.1 leupeptin, pH = 7.2–7.3, 265–270 mosm/liter. The slice (300 μm) was placed in a perfusion chamber attached to the fixed-stage of an upright microscope (Olympus) and submerged in continuously flowing oxygenated artificial cerebrospinal fluid. For blocking glutamate transmission, the α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole proprionic acid/kainate (AMPA/KA) receptor antagonist 6-cyano-7-nitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione (10 μm) and N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor antagonist d(–)-2-amino-5-phosphonopetanoic acid (25 μm) were added to the recording solution. Cells were visualized with a 40× water-immersion lens and illuminated with near infrared (IR) light, and the image was detected with an IR-sensitive CCD camera. A Multiclamp 700A amplifier (Axon instruments, Union City, CA) was used for these recordings. Tight seals (2–10 GΩ) from visualized pyramidal neurons were obtained by applying negative pressure. The membrane was disrupted with additional suction and the whole-cell configuration was obtained. The access resistances ranged from 13 to 18 MΩ and were compensated 50–70%. Cells were held at –70 mV for the recording of spontaneous IPSCs. To examine the muscarinic regulation of intrinsic firing patterns, current-clamp recordings were performed using patch electrodes filled with the internal solution (in mm): 60 K2SO4, 60 N-methyl-d-glucamine, 40 HEPES, 4 MgCl2, 5 BAPTA, 12 phosphocreatine, 2 Na2ATP, 0.2 Na3GTP, 0.1 leupeptin, pH = 7.2–7.3, 265–270 mosm/liter. The resting membrane potential of the neurons was –61.4 ± 0.96 mV (wild-type, n = 10) and –61.1 ± 1.02 mV (APP transgenic: n = 9) in control Ringer's solution, and –59.3 ± 0.65 mV (wild-type, n = 10) and –59.6 ± 0.73 mV (APP transgenic: n = 9) in the presence of carbachol (10 μm). Glutamatergic and GABAergic transmission was blocked to ensure that the phenomena studied were independent of synaptic transmission. All experiments were performed side by side with cells from wild-type versus APP transgenic mice or non-treated versus Aβ-treated slices. Mini Analysis Program (Synaptosoft, Leonia, NJ) was used to analyze synaptic activity. Individual synaptic events with fast onset and exponential decay kinetics were captured with threshold detectors in Mini Analysis software. All quantitative measurements were taken 4–6 min after drug application. IPSCs of 60 s (200–1000 events) under each different treatment were used for obtaining the cumulative distribution plots. The detection parameters for analyzing synaptic events in each cell in the absence or presence of carbachol were the same. Statistical comparisons of the frequency and amplitude of synaptic currents were made using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) test. Numerical values were expressed as mean ± S.E. Muscarinic receptor ligand carbachol (CCh), atropine and pirenzepine (Sigma), as well as second messenger reagents calphostin C, bisindolylmaleimide I (i.e. GF109203X; Gö6850), and myristoylated PKI-(14–22) (Calbiochem) were made up as concentrated stocks in water and stored at –20 °C. Stocks were thawed and diluted immediately prior to use. The β-amyloid peptide Aβ25–35 and the control peptide containing the reverse sequence Aβ35–25 were obtained from Sigma. These peptides were resuspended in sterile distilled water at a concentration of 2 mm and incubated at 37 °C for 1 h to allow fibril formation. Western Blot Analysis—For detecting activated PKC, a phospho-PKC (pan) antibody that recognizes PKCα, βI, βII, ∈, η, and δ isoforms only when phosphorylated at a carboxyl-terminal residue homologous to Ser660 of PKCβII was used in the Western blot analysis. After incubation, slices were transferred to boiling 1% SDS and homogenized immediately. Insoluble material was removed by centrifugation (13,000 × g for 10 min), and protein concentration for each sample was measured. Equal amounts of protein from slice homogenates were separated on 7.5% acrylamide gels and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. The blots were blocked with 5% nonfat dry milk for1hat room temperature. Then the blots were incubated with the phospho-PKC (pan) antibody (Cell Signaling, 1:2000) for1hat room temperature. After being rinsed, the blots were incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit antibodies (Amersham Biosciences, 1:2000) for 1 h at room temperature. Following three washes, the blots were exposed to the enhanced chemiluminescence substrate. Then the blots were stripped for 1hat50 °C followed by saturation in 5% nonfat dry milk and incubated with a PKC antibody (Santa Cruz, 1:2000) recognizing the α, β, and γ isoforms. Quantitation was obtained from densitometric measurements of immunoreactive bands on autoradiograms. Data correspond to the mean ± S.E. of 5–10 samples per condition and were analyzed by ANOVA tests. mRNA Detection—PFCs were dissected from wild-type and APP transgenic mouse brain slices (400 μm) and homogenized in 0.5 ml of TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). Following 5 min of incubation at room temperature, 0.1 ml of chloroform was added and mixed with the homogenized samples. The tubes were incubated at 25 °C for 2–3 min and then centrifuged for 15 min at 4 °C. The upper aqueous phase containing RNA for each sample was transferred to a fresh tube. Then RNA was precipitated from the aqueous phase by mixing with 0.25 ml of isopropyl alcohol, incubating at room temperature for 10 min and then centrifuging for 10 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was removed, and the RNA pellet was washed with 75% ethanol. The RNA pellet was air-dried and then dissolved in diethyl pyrocarbonate-treated water. Prior to reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), the isolated RNA was treated with DNase I (Invitrogen) to eliminate genomic DNA. The reaction mixture (10 μl) contained 1 μg of RNA, 1 μl of 10× DNase I reaction buffer, 1 μl of DNase I (1 unit/μl), and 8 μl of diethyl pyrocarbonate-treated water. The tube was incubated at room temperature for 15 min. The reaction was terminated by adding 1 μl of 25 mm EDTA and heating for 10 min at 65 °C. RT-PCR analysis of muscarinic receptor cDNAs was performed as described previously (29Yan Z. Surmeier D.J. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 2592-2604Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 30Yan Z. Flores-Hernandez J. Surmeier D.J. Neuroscience. 2001; 103: 1017-1024Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). PCR products were separated by electrophoresis in a 1.5% agarose gel stained with ethidium bromide. As a control for genomic contamination, samples were prepared as described above except that the RT was omitted in the reverse transcription procedure. Muscarinic Modulation of the Spontaneous IPSC Amplitude Is Abolished in APP Transgenic Mice—To test the impact of muscarinic receptors (mAChRs) on GABAergic inhibitory transmission in PFC, we first examined the effect of mAChR agonist carbachol on spontaneous inhibitory postsynaptic currents (sIPSCs) in mouse pyramidal neurons located in deep layers of PFC. Application of the GABAA receptor antagonist bicuculline (10 μm) completely blocked the sIPSCs (n = 5, data not shown), indicating that these synaptic currents are mediated by GABAA receptors. Bath application of carbachol (20 μm), a broad-spectrum cholinergic agonist, caused a reversible increase in the amplitude and frequency of sIPSCs (Fig. 1, A–C). The increase developed gradually and reached a plateau 4–6 min after the application of carbachol. A tonic increase of sIPSCs, rather than periodical bursts of sIPSCs (31Kondo S. Kawaguchi Y. Neurosience. 2001; 107: 551-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), was observed in response to carbachol in most of our cells. In a sample of PFC pyramidal neurons examined, carbachol increased the mean amplitude of sIPSCs by 62.4 ± 9.7% (n = 18, p < 0.001, K-S test) and the mean frequency of sIPSCs by 220 ± 35.1% (n = 18, p < 0.001, K-S test). In the presence of pirenzepine (1 μm), an antagonist for m1/m4 receptors, carbachol failed to cause a significant change in sIPSCs (mean amplitude: 5.5 ± 3.0%; mean frequency: 5.3 ± 7.0%; n = 5, p > 0.05, K-S test), suggesting the mediation by m1 or m4 mAChRs. Since m1 is the most prominent subtype abundantly expressed in the majority of cortical neurons (16Levey A.I. Kitt C.A. Simonds W.F. Price D.L. Brann M.R. J. Neurosci. 1991; 11: 3218-3226Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18Ma X.H. Zhong P. Gu Z. Feng J. Yan Z. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 1159-1168Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the potent effect of carbachol on GABA transmission found in about 90% of the PFC pyramidal neurons we examined is likely to be mediated by the m1 receptor. We next examined whether the muscarinic modulation of GABAergic inhibitory transmission is altered in the AD model. Compared with wild-type mice, APP transgenic mice exhibited significantly higher (∼20–30-fold) levels of Aβ peptides at 2 months of age, even though no amyloid plaques, neuronal death, or cognitive deficit were observed at the early stage (25Hsiao K. Chapman P. Nilsen S. Eckman C. Harigaya Y. Younkin S. Yang F. Cole G. Science. 1996; 274: 99-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (3700) Google Scholar). Amyloid deposits were found in frontal cortex, along with other brain regions, in aged APP transgenic mice (25Hsiao K. Chapman P. Nilsen S. Eckman C. Harigaya Y. Younkin S. Yang F. Cole G. Science. 1996; 274: 99-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (3700) Google Scholar), suggesting that the elevated Aβ expression is present in frontal cortical neurons at the presymptomatic period. We first compared the basal properties of sIPSCs in wild-type versus APP transgenic mice. No significant difference was found between the two groups (mean amplitude: WT, 36.2 ± 3.7 pA, n = 18; APP transgenic, 34.4 ± 2.9 pA, n = 29, p > 0.05, ANOVA; mean frequency: WT, 4.2 ± 0.6 Hz, n = 18; APP transgenic, 3.8 ± 0.4 Hz, n = 29, p > 0.05, ANOVA). The lack of changes on the basal GABAergic transmission in APP transgenic mice suggests that PFC GABAergic interneurons are not lost or significantly impaired. We then examined the effect of carbachol on sIPSCs in APP transgenic mice. As shown in Fig. 1, D–F, bath application of carbachol (20 μm) failed to increase the sIPSC amplitude in the mutant cell, but the carbachol-induced enhancement of sIPSC frequency was intact. In a sample of PFC pyramidal neurons from APP transgenic mice, carbachol caused little change in the mean amplitude of sIPSCs (7.16 ± 3.2%, n = 29, p > 0.05, K-S test), but still significantly increased the mean frequency of sIPSCs (198.6 ± 27.0%, n = 29, p < 0.001, K-S test). The effects of carbachol on the sIPSC amplitude and frequency in PFC neurons from wild-type versus APP transgenic mice are summarized in Fig. 1G. It is evident that muscarinic modulation of the sIPSC amplitude, but not the sIPSC frequency, was significantly (p < 0.001, ANOVA) impaired in APP transgenic mice. Muscarinic Modulation of the sIPSC Amplitude Is Eliminated in Rat PFC Slices Pretreated with the β-Amyloid Peptide—We then examined whether the altered muscarinic modulation of GABA transmission in APP transgenic mice is attributable to the elevated β-amyloid protein levels at an early age (25Hsiao K. Chapman P. Nilsen S. Eckman C. Harigaya Y. Younkin S. Yang F. Cole G. Science. 1996; 274: 99-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (3700) Google Scholar). To do so, we treated rat PFC slices with β-amyloid peptides (Aβ) before examining carbachol effects on sIPSCs. Aβ25–35, which represents the biologically active region of Aβ (32Yankner B.A. Duffy L.K. Kirschner D.A. Science. 1990; 250: 279-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (1910) Google Scholar, 33McDonald D. Bamberger M. Combs C. Landreth G. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 4451-4460Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), was aged to produce aggregated Aβ25–35. In non-treated rat slices, bath application of carbachol caused a reversible increase in the amplitude and frequency of sIPSCs (Fig. 2, A–C), similar to what was found in wild-type mice. However, in Aβ25–35-treated slices, carbachol failed to increase the sIPSC amplitude, but still induced a potent enhancement of the sIPSC frequency. A representative example from an Aβ25–35-treated neuron is shown in Fig. 2, D–F. To confirm the specificity of the action of Aβ25–35, its control peptide containing the reverse sequence Aβ35–25 was used to pretreat PFC slices. Similar to non-treated slices, in Aβ35–25-treated slices, bath application of carbachol induced a reversible increase in the sIPSC amplitude (Fig. 2G). As summarized in Fig. 2H, in Aβ25–35-treated pyramidal neurons, carbachol caused little change in the mean amplitude of sIPSCs (4.27 ± 2.6%, n = 17, p > 0.05, K-S test), which was significantly (p < 0.001, ANOVA) different from the carbachol effect on the sIPSC amplitude in non-treated neurons (78.6 ± 10.5%, n = 35, p < 0.001, K-S test) or neurons pretreated with the control peptide Aβ35–25 (77.4 ± 12.5%, n = 5, p < 0.001, K-S test). However, the carbachol-induced increase in the mean frequency of sIPSCs in Aβ25–35-treated neurons (221.5 ± 31.4%, n = 17, p < 0.001, K-S test) was similar to the carbachol effect in non-treated neurons (245.4 ± 32.4%, n = 35, p < 0.001, K-S test) or Aβ35–25-treated neurons (231.7 ± 38.3%, n = 5, p < 0.001, K-S test). Despite the ability of Aβ25–35 to alter the muscarinic regulation of sIPSCs, Aβ25–35 itself had little direct effect on the sIPSC amplitude (5.3 ± 2.1%, n = 10, p > 0.05, K-S test) and frequency (8.9 ± 3.1%, n = 10, p > 0.05, K-S test). In prefrontal cortex, serotonin, by activating 5-HT2 receptors, can also potentiate GABA transmission (34Zhou F.M. Hablitz J.J. J. Neurophysiol. 1999; 82: 2989-2999Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). To test whether β-amyloid impairs the actions of 5-HT2 receptors, we examined the serotonergic regulation of sIPSCs in Aβ25–35-treated PFC slices. Application of serotonin (20 μm) caused a potent increase in the mean amplitude and frequency of sIPSCs in Aβ25–35-treated PFC pyramidal neurons (amplitude: 80.7 ± 14.4% (Fig. 2I); frequency: 387.4 ± 75.0%, n = 6, p < 0.001, K-S test), which was not significantly different from the serotonin effect on sIPSCs in non-treated neurons (amplitude: 85.8 ± 16.8% (Fig. 2I); frequency: 392.3 ± 65.6%, n = 10, p < 0.001, K-S test), suggesting the lack of Aβ effect on serotonin functions. Taken together, these results indicate that β-amyloid selectively alters the muscarinic regulation of GABA transmission. Muscarinic Modulation of GABA Transmission Is through a PKC-dependent Mechanism—To find out the potential reason for the impairment of muscarinic modulation of GABA transmission in PFC from APP transgenic mice, we first examined the cellular mechanisms underlying the modulation of GABA transmission by mAChRs. It is known that activation of m1 receptors stimulates the hydrolysis of membrane phosphoinositol lipids, leading to PKC activation, while activation of m4 receptors inhibits adenylyl cyclase. To test whether the muscarinic modulation of GABA transmission is through the m1-activated PKC, we tested the effect of carbachol on IPSCs when PKC activation was blocked. We first preincubated rat PFC slices with the cell-permeable and specific PKC inhibitor calphostin C (1 μm) for 1 h, followed by the examination of carbachol effects on sIPSCs. As shown in Fig. 3, A and B, carbachol failed to enhance sIPSC amplitudes in the calphostin C-treated slice. The carbachol enhancement of sIPSC frequencies was not significantly affected by calphostin C (Fig. 3C). Another potent and selective PKC inhibitor, bisindolylmaleimide (1 μm), gave similar results as calphostin C, eliminating the carbachol enhancement of sIPSC amplitudes (data not shown). To confirm the specific involvement of m1/PKC in the muscarinic regulation, PFC slices were preincubated with the cell-permeable myristoylated PKA inhibitor PKI-(14–22) (1 μm) to test the potential role of m4/PKA in this process. As shown in Fig. 3, D–F, carbachol still induced a potent increase in sIPSC amplitudes and frequencies in the PKI-(14–22)-treated slice, similar to what was obtained in the non-treated slice (Fig. 2, A–C), indicating that PKA inhibition did not affect the muscarinic regulation of GABA transmission. As summarized in Fig. 3G, the carbachol effect on sIPSC amplitudes in the presence of PKC inhibitor calphostin C (–21.6 ± 5.8%, n = 6, p > 0.05, K-S test) or bisindolylmaleimide (–19.6 ± 4.3%, n = 7, p > 0.05, K-S test) was significantly (p < 0.001, ANOVA) different from that in the presence of PKA inhibitor PKI-(14–22) (76.7 ± 11.3%, n = 5, p < 0.01, K-S test). The carbachol effect on sIPSC frequencies was similar with these treatments (Fig. 3H, calphostin C: 180.4 ± 32.7%, n = 6; bisindolylmaleimide: 200.8 ± 41.7%, n = 7; PKI-(14–22): 210.8 ± 38.8%, n = 5). These data suggest that the muscarinic modulation of sIPSC amplitudes (but not frequencies) depends on the activation of PKC. Muscarinic Activation of PKC Is Lost in APP Transgenic Mice—Given the PKC dependence, we speculated that the underlying mechanism for the loss of muscarinic modulation of GABA transmission in APP transgenic mice is the impaired muscarinic activation of PKC in these mutants. To test this, we compared the muscarinic activation of PKC in PFC slices from wild-type and APP transgenic mice. Because the catalytic competence of many PKC isozymes depends on autophosphorylation at the carboxyl terminus on a conserved residue (35Behn-Krappa A. Newton A.C. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 728-737Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar), a phosphospecific pan PKC antibody that de"

Yeast with mutations in the transcription elongation machinery are sensitive to inhibitors of this enzyme such as 6-azauracil and mycophenolic acid, at least partly because of their inability to transcriptionally induce IMPDH. To understand the molecular basis of this drug-sensitive phenotype, we have dissected the expression and function of a four-gene family in yeast called IMD1 through IMD4. We show here that these family members are distinct, despite a high degree of amino acid identity between the proteins they encode. Extrachromosomal copies of IMD1, IMD3, or IMD4 could not rescue the drug-sensitive phenotype of IMD2 deletants. When overexpressed, IMD3 or IMD4 weakly compensated for deletion of IMD2. IMD1 is transcriptionally silent and bears critical amino acid substitutions compared with IMD2 that destroy its function, offering strong evidence that it is a pseudogene. The simultaneous deletion of all four IMD genes was lethal unless growth media were supplemented with guanine. This suggests that there are no other essential functions of the IMPDH homologs aside from IMP dehydrogenase activity. Although neither IMD3 nor IMD4 could confer drug resistance to cells lacking IMD2, either alone was sufficient to confer guanine prototrophy. The special function of IMD2 was provided by its ability to be transcriptionally induced and the probable intrinsic drug resistance of its enzymatic activity.

It is an important enzyme whose abundance and activity are correlated with cellular growth rate (1Jackson R.C. Weber G. Morris H.P. Nature. 1975; 256: 331-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). The enzymology and pharmacology of IMPDH are well studied in mammalian systems because it is a target of chemotherapy, and it plays a critical role in metabolism (2Hedstrom L. Curr. Med. Chem. 1999; 6: 545-560Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The IMPDH enzymes across phlya show widely varying sensitivities to mycophenolic acid, with K i values from 7 nm to 18 μm (3Snyder F.F. Lightfoot T. Hodges S.D. Sahota A. Taylor M. Purine and Pyrimidine Metabolism in Man VIII. Plenum Press, New York1995: 725-728Google Scholar, 4Zhang R. Evans G. Rotella F. Westbrook E. Huberman E. Joachimiak A. Collart F.R. Curr. Med. Chem. 1999; 6: 537-543PubMed Google Scholar). Also, mutations in human IMPDH may be causally involved in some cases of inherited retinitis pigmentosa (5Bowne S.J. Sullivan L.S. Blanton S.H. Cepko C.L. Blackshaw S. Birch D.G. Hughbanks-Wheaton D.

Genet. 2002; 11: 547-557Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar).It is becoming clear that duplicated genes are a common feature of many genomes. Members of a duplicated gene family may degenerate into nonfunctional pseudogenes or serve as raw material for evolutionary diversity by acquiring novel functions (7Prince V.E. Pickett F.B. Nat. Rev. Genet. 2002; 3: 827-837Crossref PubMed Scopus (553) Google Scholar). The human and mouse genomes each contain two IMPDH genes: IMPDH type I is constitutively expressed, whereas IMPDH type II is inducible (8Nagai M. Natsumeda Y. Weber G. Cancer Res. 1992; 52: 258-261PubMed Google Scholar). Saccharomyces cerevisiae contains four IMPDH-like genes (IMD1–IMD4; Fig. 1) that display 83–96% amino acid identity between themselves when aligned pairwise. They are closely related to mammalian IMPDHs, showing 58–60% amino acid identity when aligned pairwise with either of the two human proteins. Yeast IMD1 and IMD2 appear to be related by an ancient chromosomal duplication (9Barton A. Bussey H. Storms R. Kaback D. Yeast. 1997; 13: 1251-1263Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 10Wolfe K.H. Shields D.C. Nature. 1997; 387: 708-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (1382) Google Scholar). IMD1 may be a pseudogene because it is very close to the telomere, and it contains a frameshifting insertion (Fig. 1; Refs. 9Barton A. Bussey H. Storms R. Kaback D. Yeast. 1997; 13: 1251-1263Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar and 11Harrison P. Kumar A. Lan N. Echols N. Snyder M. Gerstein M. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 316: 409-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). It is not known whether IMD1 is transcribed or can yield a full-length protein in vivo as a result of regulated frameshifting. IMD1 and IMD2 are the most closely related IMD pair (96% amino acid identity) and have proven difficult to delete, presumably due to their telomereproximal location (Ref. 9Barton A. Bussey H. Storms R. Kaback D. Yeast. 1997; 13: 1251-1263Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar; Saccharomyces Genome Deletion Project, www-sequence.stanford.edu/group/yeast_deletion_project/deletions3.html). However, strains were constructed in which a large deletion of chromosome I resulted in the loss of the promoter of IMD1, the 5′-untranslated region, and the first 11 codons. This strain and a similar one containing a comparable deletion of part of chromosome VIII and IMD2 are phenotypically normal, suggesting that neither of these is an essential gene (9Barton A. Bussey H. Storms R. Kaback D. Yeast. 1997; 13: 1251-1263Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Contrasting results were reported for IMD2 by Niedenthal et al. (12Niedenthal R. Riles L. Guldener U. Klein S. Johnston M. Hegemann J.H. Yeast. 1999; 15: 1775-1796Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), who indicated that IMD2 deletion leads to lethality.Deletion of IMD3 or IMD4 does not impact viability (13Winzeler E.A. Shoemaker D.D.

Although not located near telomeres, this gene pair is also related through an ancient duplication of portions of chromosomes XII and XIII (10Wolfe K.H. Shields D.C.

IMD4 is the only yeast IMD that contains an intron (Fig. 1). Given their high sequence homology and the finding that there are four nonessential IMD genes, its seems likely there is functional redundancy among the members of this family, yet the biological and biochemical role of these genes and their gene products in yeast is poorly understood. Whereas redundancy is suggested, there is also specialization between IMD genes, as indicated by the ability of IMD2 to become transcriptionally induced and provide drug resistance (16Escobar-Henriques M.

Although thought to be necessary, it is not known whether induction of IMD2 is sufficient for the acquisition of drug resistance. Some evidence suggests that IMD3 may also be induced (19Escobar-Henriques M. Balguerie A. Monribot C. Boucherie H. Daignan-Fornier B. J. Biol.

Initially, it was shown that mutation or deletion of DST1 (also known as PPR2), the gene encoding elongation factor SII (also known as TFIIS), can render cells sensitive to 6-azauracil and mycophenolic acid (MPA) (20Hubert J.-C.

Both drugs result in the inhibition of IMPDH, which in turn results in a reduction of cellular nucleotide pools (21Exinger G. Lacroute F. Curr. Genet. 1992; 22: 9-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). Subsequently, mutation of other elements of the yeast elongation machinery has been shown to confer growth sensitivities to MPA and 6-azauracil (24Wind M. Reines D. Bioessays. 2000; 22: 327-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar, 25Reines D. Methods Enzymol. 2003; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). Transcriptional induction of IMPDH expression has been observed in both mammalian and yeast cells after drug challenge, indicating that nucleotide pool levels are closely monitored in vivo and that their biosynthesis can be transcriptionally regulated (16Escobar-Henriques M. Daignan-Fornier B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 1523-1530Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 17Shaw R.J. Reines D. Mol. Cell.

In yeast, it is likely that IMD2 contributes the most to this induction. Genetic evidence indicates that an optimally functioning elongation machinery is important for induction of IMD2 (17Shaw R.J.

The inability of yeast with mutations in the transcription elongation machinery to induce IMD2 explains, in part, their sensitivity to IMPDH antagonists. There is, however, more than one mechanism by which yeast can become sensitive to 6-azauracil or MPA (17Shaw R.J. Reines D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 7427-7437Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 18Shaw R.J. Wilson J.L. Smith K.T. Reines D. J. Biol.

Chem. 2002; 277: 27036-27044Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar).Multiple factors are involved in de-repression of IMD2. Promoter elements governing the response have been identified and shown to confer induction upon heterologous genes (16Escobar-Henriques M. Daignan-Fornier B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 1523-1530Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 17Shaw R.J. Reines D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 7427-7437Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). The proteins responsible for sensing guanine nucleotide levels and de-repressing or activating transcription are unknown. Although the majority of the inductive response appears to be due to IMD2, and deletion of only IMD2 results in 6-azauracil and MPA sensitivity, there is some indication that other members of this gene family are transcriptionally active and may also be up-regulated during nucleotide deprivation (17Shaw R.J. Reines D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 7427-7437Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 19Escobar-Henriques M. Balguerie A. Monribot C. Boucherie H. Daignan-Fornier B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 46237-46242Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). However, assessment of individual IMD transcripts by Northern blot and microarray hybridization techniques is confounded by the high degree of relatedness of their mRNAs. An essential tool in dissecting the differential function of the members of this gene family would be a set of single, double, triple, and quadruple deletions, which would enable the examination of each gene's contribution to IMPDH activity in the cell both before and after induction and the dissection of any functional redundancy.Here we have constructed such a set of yeast strains and assayed them for growth on rich media and mycophenolic acid. The induction of each member of the IMD family was studied in isolation in triple IMD mutants. The ability of the different IMD genes to rescue the drug-sensitive phenotype was also investigated. The gene family, taken together, is essential, and its loss renders yeast auxotrophic for guanine. By a number of criteria, IMD1 is functionally inert. We show that IMD2 and, to a lesser extent, IMD4 are induced in the presence of these drugs. IMD3 and IMD4 are clearly functional because either is sufficient for guanine prototrophy, and both are distinct from IMD2 because their overexpression by two different means fails to provide drug resistance. The data indicate that IMD2 encodes an inducible and relatively drug-resistant IMPDH.MATERIALS AND METHODSChemicalsGuanine (Sigma) was dissolved to 50 mm in 1N NaOH, and 250 μl were spread onto 25 ml of solid medium. Mycophenolic acid (Sigma) was dissolved to 15 mg/ml (w/v) in dimethyl sulfoxide and added to molten media before plates were poured. Zymolyase was obtained from US Biological. G418 sulfate (Cellgro) was dissolved in 0.1 m HEPES to 200 mg/ml and used at 250 μg/ml. SC and YPD media have been described previously (31Sherman F. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 3-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (2532) Google Scholar).Plasmid ConstructionIMD Expression Vectors—Single copy and high copy plasmids containing the IMD1–IMD4 genes were constructed as follows. For IMD1, IMD3, and IMD4, each gene was amplified by PCR using Pfu DNA polymerase (Stratagene), cut with XhoI and NotI, and inserted into similarly cut pRS426. The primers used were 5′-gactagtgcggccgcgatcggttgaccgcagtatt-3′ and 5′-gactagtctcgagaatgaatcacggaacccaat-3′ for IMD1, 5′-gactagtgcggccgcagggctaggatatcgggaaa-3′ and 5′-gactagtctcgagcggagaaaaagccacaactg-3′ for IMD3, and 5′-gactagtgcggccgcctcttaaaggttccgcctca-3′ and 5′-gactagtctcgagccgccttcactagacgaact-3′ for IMD4. A similarly constructed IMD2 plasmid has been described previously (18Shaw R.J. Wilson J.L. Smith K.T. Reines D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 32905-32916Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The respective plasmids (called pIMD1-Pfu, pIMD2-S288C, pIMD3-Pfu, and pIMD4-Pfu) were used as a source of XhoI-NotI fragments to move the IMD genes to the similarly cut CEN plasmid, pRS316 (pIMD1/316, pRS316-IMD2, pIMD3/316, and pIMD4/316). The pIMD1/316 plasmid was mutagenized (Gene Dynamics, Limited Liability Corp.) by deletion of an adenylate residue 1119 bp downstream from the adenylate of the initiating ATG to create pIMD1-dA/316. The corresponding XhoI-NotI fragment was removed from this plasmid and inserted into pRS426 to generate the high copy plasmid, pIMD1-dA/426. For expression of the IMD genes from the IMD2 promoter, DNA encoding the open reading frames (ORFs) was digested with SpeI and XhoI after amplification from the respective plasmids described above using 5′-gcactagtatggccgccattagagactacaagacc-3′ and 5′-gactagtctcgagaatgaatcacggaacccaat-3′ (IMD1 and IMD1-dA), 5′-gcactagtatggccgccattagagactacaagacc-3′ and 5′-gactagtctcgagtcgtaaacataacaccccatca-3′ (IMD2), 5′-gcactagtatggccgccgttagagactacaagact-3′ and 5′-gactagtctcgagcggagaaaaagccacaactg-3′ (IMD3), and 5′-gcactagtatgagtgctgctccattggattacaaa-3′ and 5′-gactagtctcgagccgccttcactagacgaact-3′ (IMD4) and inserted with the IMD2 promoter (cut with NotI and SpeI after amplification from pIMD2-S288C using 5′-gactagtgcggccgcatcggttgagcgcgatatta-3′ and 5′-gcactagttgcttttgctacttgtggagt-3′) into NotI- and XhoI-cut pRS316. These plasmids are called p2P/IMD1/316 through p2P/IMD4/316.Promoter deletion derivatives were made by amplifying portions of IMD2 from pIMD2-S288C and inserting them into pRS426. pIMD2-GRE,RE was generated by inserting SpeI- and XhoI-cut PCR product made with 5′-ggactagtaactgtcataaacgcattttgt-3′ and 5′-gactagtctcgagtcgtaaacataacaccccatca-3′ into similarly cut pRS426. pIMD2-GRE was created by first amplifying IMD2 sequence using 5′-ggactagttggtaaaaatttcggctgga-3′ and 5′-gactagtctcgagtcgtaaacataacaccccatca-3′, cutting the product with SpeI and XhoI, and inserting it into similarly cut pRS426. This intermediate construct was cut with NotI and SpeI and ligated to a similarly cut PCR product amplified from pIMD2-S288C using 5′-gactagtgcggccgcatcggttgagcgcgatatt-3′ and 5′-ggactagtggcggttacgaaaaccaata-3′. pIMD2-RE was made by cutting pIMD2-GRE,RE with NotI and SpeI and inserting similarly cut PCR product made from pIMD2-S288C using 5′-gactagtgcggccgcatcggttgagcgcgatatt-3′ and 5′-ggactagtggaatagaatagaatacgg-3′. This family of plasmids was then used to move the corresponding XhoI-NotI restriction fragments into pRS316 for the final vectors used in Fig. 3.Fig. 3Mycophenolic acid sensitivity of IMD deletants. Yeast strains were grown overnight in YPD with 0.5 mm guanine and diluted to an A 600 of 0.01 in SC. Five μl of this suspension and 10-fold serial dilutions thereof were spotted onto SC containing no drug or mycophenolic acid and incubated at 30 °C. Yeast strains used were those indicated in the Fig. 2 legend.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)IMD1-IMD2 Chimeric ORF Constructs—The 550-bp BspHI-SpeI fragment from p2P/IMD1-dA/316 and the 1170-bp BspHI-XhoI fragment from p2P/IMD2/316 were ligated into the plasmid backbone fragment of SpeI- and XhoI-cut p2P/IMD2/316 to generate p1-dA/548/2. The 550-bp BspHI-SpeI fragment from p2P/IMD2/316 and the 1170-bp BspHI-XhoI fragment from p2P/IMD1-dA/316 were ligated into the plasmid backbone fragment of SpeI- and XhoI-cut p2P/IMD2/316 to generate p2/548/1-dA. The 315-bp SpeI-AvaII fragment from p2/IMD1-dA/316 and the 1370-bp AvaII-XhoI fragment from p2P/IMD2/316 were ligated into the plasmid backbone fragment of SpeI- and XhoI-cut p2P/IMD2/316 to generate pRSChiA. pRSChiB was constructed by ligating the 315-bp SpeI-AvaII fragment from p2P/IMD2/316 and the 1370-bp AvaII-XhoI fragment from p1-dA/548/2 into the plasmid backbone fragment of SpeI- and XhoI-cut p2P/IMD2/316. p2P/IMD2/316-G93D and p2P/IMD2/316-T38A were generated by site-directed mutagenesis (Gene Dynamics, Limited Liability Corp.) by changing the Gly93 codon and the Thr38 codon of p2P/IMD2/316 to GAT and GCT, respectively. pRS316-IMD2-D229N was made by changing the Asp229 codon to AAT in pRS316-IMD2.IMD Knockout Vectors—pUC119-IMD2KO was created by inserting three PCR products into the pUC119 vector in separate subclonings. The first insert was a 1720-bp PCR product amplified from S288C genomic DNA using 5′-atcgatgagctcttgcaaaccatcagtgaagc-3′ and 5′-accggtcccgggtgcttttgctacttgtggagtt-3′. The PCR product was digested with SacI and XmaI and ligated into pUC119 cut with the same enzymes. The second product was a 2196-bp PCR product amplified from LEU2 in pRS315 using 5′-gacgtccccgggggtgatgacggtgaaaacct-3′ and 5′-gtatactctagaggcgcctgattcaagaaata-3′. The product was digested with XmaI and XbaI and ligated into the above plasmid cut similarly. Finally, a 1566-bp XbaI- and PstI-cut PCR product amplified from S288C genomic DNA using 5′-atcgactctagatgtccgtatgtcctcctgtt-3′ and 5′-acgggtctgcaggtccccttcaagcacaacat-3′ was inserted into the resulting plasmid from the previous step. This results in a plasmid containing a disruption cassette with LEU2 flanked by IMD2 DNA upstream and downstream of the IMD2 ORF. The SacI and PstI product released from this plasmid was used for homologous recombination and knockout of IMD2 after lithium acetate transformation and selection on leucine dropout medium.pBS-IMD1KO was created in a similar fashion to pUC119-IMD2KO. The first insert ligated into pBluescript was a SacI- and SmaI-digested 970-bp PCR product amplified from S288C genomic DNA using 5′-ggatccgagctcaacgtcagcagcgtcagtaa-3′ and 5′-aagcttcccgggttgctttcgctacttgtgga-3′. The second insert was an SmaI- and EcoRI-cut 1280-bp product amplified from S288C genomic DNA using 5′-atcgatcccgggacggtcctgttccctagcat-3′ and 5′-gtatacgaattcgcctcgttcagaatgacacgta-3′. The final insert was an EcoRI- and XhoI-cut 583-bp product amplified from S288C genomic DNA using the primers 5′-cctagggaattcggcacctgtacatactgcgtta-3′ and 5′-gtatacctcgagcatctatcccctgcccaata-3′. A 2.8-kb knockout cassette released after SacI-XhoI digestion was used to transform yeast. The expected DNA sequences were confirmed for all constructs.Yeast StrainsThe yeast strains used in these studies are listed in Table I. DNA transformation was performed as described previously (32Gietz D. St Jean A. Woods R.A. Schiestl R.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 1425Crossref PubMed Scopus (2878) Google Scholar). DY868 was constructed by transforming a diploid heterozygous IMD3 knockout strain (BY4743-26035; Research Genetics) with the IMD1 gene disruption cassette, selecting for HIS+ transformants and assaying for integration by PCR using a primer complementary to IMD1 and a primer complementary to HIS3. Strain DY871 was generated from DY868 after transformation with the IMD2 disruption cassette, selection on leucine dropout medium, and confirmation of accurate deletion of IMD2 by PCR using a primer complementary to IMD2 and a primer complementary to LEU2. DY872 was generated from DY871 transformed with an IMD4 gene disruption cassette made by PCR using 5′-accaattccatagctttgaagaaacctaacaaacattttacgatggattcggtaatctccgaaca-3′ and 5′-ttatatgcaaaaataaacttttaaatatctatggatgcttactcaacaccgcagggtaataactg-3′ to amplify URA3 from the plasmid pRS316. DY872 was sporulated in sporulation medium (31Sherman F. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 3-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (2532) Google Scholar), and tetrads were plated and dissected on guanine-containing YPD. Haploids DY873-DY887 were tested for growth on the respective media, and genotypes were confirmed by PCR.Table IYeast strains used in this studyStrainGenotypeABGG11aFrom A. Barton and D.

https://openalex.org/W2019675345,"Nuclear localization and high levels of the Y-box binding protein YB1 appear to be important indicators of drug resistance and tumor prognosis. YB1 also interacts with the p53 tumor suppressor protein. In this paper, we explore a role for p53 in the nuclear localization of YB1. We report that various genotoxic stresses induce nuclear localization of YB1 in a small proportion of treated cells, but only in cells with wild-type p53. We go on to show directly that functional p53 is required for YB1 to translocate to the nucleus. Tumor-associated p53 mutants however are attenuated for YB1 nuclear localization as are mutants mutated in the proline-rich domain of p53. These data link the DNA-damage response of p53 to YB1 nuclear translocation. In addition, we find that YB1 inhibits p53-induced cell death and its ability to trans-activate promoters of genes involved in cell death signaling. Together these data suggest that some forms of p53 cause YB1 to accumulate in the nucleus, which in turn inhibits p53 activity. These results provide a possible explanation for the correlation of nuclear YB1 with drug resistance and poor prognosis in some tumor types, and for the first time implicate p53 in the process of nuclear translocation."

https://openalex.org/W2053785878,"In cholestasis, toxic bile acids accumulate within the liver inducing hepatocyte apoptosis, which exacerbates liver injury. Although bile acids activate both death receptors and mitogen-activated kinase (MAPK) pathways, the mechanistic link between death receptor signaling and MAPK activation in bile acid apoptosis remains unclear. The aim of this study was to ascertain if MAPKs contribute to bile acid cytotoxicity. Although deoxycholate induced apoptosis and activated all three classic mediators of the MAPK pathways including JNK 1/2, p38, and p42/44, only p38 MAPK inhibition attenuated apoptosis. Suppressing FADD expression with siRNA or employing a caspase inhibitor, zVAD-fmk, did not block p38 MAPK activation suggesting its activation was not death receptor-dependent. Unexpectedly, expression of cFLIP-L in a stably transfected cell line blocked apoptosis and p38 MAPK phosphorylation. Based on these data we postulated a direct effect of cFLIP on p38 MAPK activation. The nonphosphorylated but not the phosphorylated/active form of p38 MAPK co-immunoprecipitated with cFLIP-L. In reverse immunoprecipitation experiments, cFLIP-L long but not cFLIP-S co-immunoprecipitate with p38 MAPK. In conclusion, these data suggest that cFLIP-L exerts its anti-apoptotic activity, in part, by inhibiting p38 MAPK activation, an additional anti-apoptotic effect for this protein. In cholestasis, toxic bile acids accumulate within the liver inducing hepatocyte apoptosis, which exacerbates liver injury. Although bile acids activate both death receptors and mitogen-activated kinase (MAPK) pathways, the mechanistic link between death receptor signaling and MAPK activation in bile acid apoptosis remains unclear. The aim of this study was to ascertain if MAPKs contribute to bile acid cytotoxicity. Although deoxycholate induced apoptosis and activated all three classic mediators of the MAPK pathways including JNK 1/2, p38, and p42/44, only p38 MAPK inhibition attenuated apoptosis. Suppressing FADD expression with siRNA or employing a caspase inhibitor, zVAD-fmk, did not block p38 MAPK activation suggesting its activation was not death receptor-dependent. Unexpectedly, expression of cFLIP-L in a stably transfected cell line blocked apoptosis and p38 MAPK phosphorylation. Based on these data we postulated a direct effect of cFLIP on p38 MAPK activation. The nonphosphorylated but not the phosphorylated/active form of p38 MAPK co-immunoprecipitated with cFLIP-L. In reverse immunoprecipitation experiments, cFLIP-L long but not cFLIP-S co-immunoprecipitate with p38 MAPK. In conclusion, these data suggest that cFLIP-L exerts its anti-apoptotic activity, in part, by inhibiting p38 MAPK activation, an additional anti-apoptotic effect for this protein. In virtually all human liver diseases, hepatocytes undergo cell death by apoptosis (1Rust C. Gores G.J. Am. J. Med. 2000; 108: 567-574Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). This is also true for cholestatic liver diseases, pathophysiologic syndromes characterized by impaired hepatocellular secretion of bile acids into bile. In cholestasis, the intracellular accumulation of toxic bile acids within hepatocytes promotes cellular injury and the subsequent development of hepatic cirrhosis and liver failure (2Greim H. Trulzsch D. Czygan P. Rudick J. Hutterer F. Schaffner F. Popper H. Gastroenterology. 1972; 63: 846-850Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Numerous studies have shown that bile acids mediate their cytotoxicity by inducing hepatocellular apoptosis (3Rodrigues C.M. Fan G. Ma X. Kren B.T. Steer C.J. J. Clin.

For example, toxic bile acids trigger oligomerization of Fas in a ligand-independent manner by promoting trafficking of intracellular Fas to the plasma membrane (7Faubion W.A. Guicciardi M.E. Miyoshi H. Bronk S.F. Roberts P.J. Svingen P.A. Kaufmann S.H. Gores G.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 103: 137-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar). In the absence of Fas, toxic bile acids enhance DR5/TRAIL-R2 expression and aggregation, also promoting a death receptor-dependent apoptosis (8Higuchi H. Bronk S.F. Takikawa Y. Werneburg N.

The in vivo relevance of these in vitro observations has been amply demonstrated (9Miyoshi H. Rust C. Roberts P.J. Burgart L.J. Gores G.J.

Insight into the mechanisms of bile acid-associated death receptor signaling is, therefore, of scientific and potential therapeutic relevance. In addition to activating death receptors, bile acids also activate mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) 1The abbreviations used are: MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; cFLIP, cellular FLICE inhibitory protein; DAPI, 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole dihydrochloride; DC, deoxycholate; DED, death effector domain; DISC, death inducing signaling complex; DR, death receptor; FADD, Fas-associated death domain protein; FAM-VAD-fmk, carboxyfluorescein-VAD-fmk; GFP, green fluorescent protein; JNK, c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase; MKK, mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase; siRNA, short interfering RNA; TNF-α, tumor necrosis factor-α; TNF-R1, tumor necrosis factor receptor 1; TRAIL, tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis inducing ligand; TRAIL-R, tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis inducing ligand-receptor.

At present three major groups of MAPKs are known: the classic p42/44 MAPK or extracellular receptor kinase 1 and 2, c-Jun-N-terminal kinase (JNK 1/2), and p38 MAPK. The p42/44 MAPKs are mainly involved in cell survival and proliferation pathways, and their inhibition has been shown to potentiate bile acid-induced apoptosis in hepatocytes (4Qiao L. Studer E. Leach K. McKinstry R. Gupta S. Decker R. Kukreja R. Valerie K. Nagarkatti P. El Deiry W. Molkentin J. Schmidt-Ullrich R. Fisher P.B. Grant S. Hylemon P.B. Dent P. Mol. Biol.

In contrast, prolonged stimulation of p38 MAPK or JNK 1/2 promotes apoptosis in a variety of other models (21Kummer J.L. Rao P.K. Heidenreich K.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20490-20494Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar, 22Xia Z. Dickens M. Raingeaud J. Davis R.J. Greenberg M.E. Science. 1995; 270: 1326-1331Crossref PubMed Scopus (5045) Google Scholar). Several upstream kinases have been implicated in the activation of the p38 MAPK and JNK 1/2 including apoptosis signaling kinase-1 which appears to activate both p38 MAPK and JNK 1/2, MKK 3/6 which activates p38 MAPK, and MKK 4/7 which activates JNK 1/2 (23Hagemann C. Blank J.L. Cell Signalling. 2001; 13: 863-875Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). Although both bile acids and death receptors, such as Fas and tumor necrosis factor receptor-1, have been shown to activate MAPK pathways, it is still unknown whether bile acid MAPK activation occurs downstream of death receptor-mediated caspase activation or by a separate, death receptor-independent pathway. Moreover, the mechanistic contribution of MAPK activation in bile acid-mediated apoptosis remains unclear. The role of death receptor caspase activation in bile acid-induced MAPK activation can be potentially delineated by inhibiting death receptor cytotoxic signaling. Death receptor-dependent caspase activation can be disrupted by interrupting formation and function of the death inducing signaling complex (DISC). Once aggregated, death receptors, such as Fas and DR5/TRAIL-R2, recruit the cytoplasmic adapter protein FADD (Fas-associated death domain) and initiator caspases, procaspase 8 and 10 to the receptor complex (24Strasser A. Newton K. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1999; 31: 533-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 25Bodmer J.L. Holler N. Reynard S. Vinciguerra P. Schneider P. Juo P. Blenis J. Tschopp J. Nat.

Once recruited to the DISC, these procaspases undergo autocatalytic processing within the DISC (27Thornberry N.A. Lazebnik Y.

This DISC formation and function can be disrupted by inhibiting FADD expression or employing a dominant negative FADD, by blocking the activation of initiator caspases with pharmacologic caspase inhibitors, or by augmenting expression of FLICE inhibitory protein (cFLIP, also called Flame-1/I-FLICE/Casper/CASH/MRIT/CLARP/Usurpin) (29Irmler M.

Interrupting DISC function should help clarify if bile acid-mediated activation of MAPK is death receptor/FADD/caspase-dependent or occurs via a parallel process. The overall objective of this study was to test the hypothesis that MAPK activation occurs and contributes to bile acid-mediated apoptosis. To address this hypothesis, the following two questions were formulated: (i) do inhibitors of p38 MAPK, p42/44 MAPK, and/or JNK 1/2 attenuate bile acid-induced apoptosis and (ii) is MAPK activation by bile acids because of death receptor-mediated caspase activation? We employed deoxycholate (DC) for these studies as it is a potent bile acid apoptogen and strongly activates MAPK pathways (4Qiao L. Studer E. Leach K. McKinstry R. Gupta S. Decker R. Kukreja R. Valerie K. Nagarkatti P. El Deiry W. Molkentin J. Schmidt-Ullrich R. Fisher P.B. Grant S. Hylemon P.B. Dent P. Mol. Biol.

The results indicate that p38 MAPK contributes to bile acid cytotoxicity, likely by a death receptor-independent pathway. Unexpectedly, cFLIP was observed to co-immunoprecipitate with the unphosphorylated form of p38 MAPK, suggesting that this protein prevents p38 MAPK activation, thereby protecting cells from bile acid-induced apoptosis. These studies suggest a new anti-apoptotic mechanism for cFLIP, namely inhibition of p38 MAPK activation. Materials—Reagents were purchased from the following suppliers: deoxycholate and Sepharose-CL 4B were obtained from Sigma; 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindolehydrochloride (DAPI) was from Molecular Probes Inc. (Eugene, OR); zVAD-fmk from Enzyme Systems Products (Livermore, CA); the JNK 1/2-inhibitor SP600125 was from Biomol Research Laboratories (Plymouth Meeting, PA), the p42/44 MAPK-inhibitor UO126 and the p38 MAPK-inhibitor SB203580 were from Calbiochem (San Diego, CA); rat monoclonal (IgG2a) anti-cFLIP and mouse monoclonal (IgG2a) anti-TNF-R1 were from Alexis (San Diego, CA); mouse monoclonal (IgG1) anti-FADD was from Transduction Laboratories (San Diego, CA); rabbit anti-total p38 MAPK and goat polyclonal anti-actin were from Santa Cruz (Santa Cruz, CA); rabbit anti-ACTIVE p38 MAPK, rabbit anti-ACTIVE JNK 1/2, and anti-ACTIVE p42/44 MAPK were purchased from Promega; horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-goat Igs, rabbit Igs, rat Igs, and mouse Igs were from BIOSOURCE (Camarillo, CA); protein G-Sepharose was from Zymed Laboratories, Inc. (San Francisco, CA). Generation of HuH-cFLIP Cell Lines and Cell Culture—HuH7 cells, a human hepatocellular carcinoma cell line, were stably transfected with cFLIP-L. An expression vector for human cFLIP-L, cDNA cloned into the multiple cloning site of a pcDNA3 plasmid, was a gift from Dr. E. Alnemri (Thomas Jefferson University, Philadelphia, PA). HuH7 cells were cultured until 30% subconfluent in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum. Transfection with the cFLIP pcDNA3 plasmid was performed using LipofectAMINE (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Stably transfected clones were selected in medium containing 1200 mg/ml G418. Individual clones were subcloned and screened for cFLIP overexpression by immunoblot analysis. Established clones were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100,000 units/liter penicillin, 100 mg/liter streptomycin, 100 mg/liter gentamycin, and 1200 mg/liter G418. Before treatment with deoxycholate or other compounds, cells were cultured in the same medium without serum for 16–48 h, reagents were then added to the media according to the experimental protocol. Plasmids and Transfection—The plasmid for mutated MKK3 (MKK3(ala) in pRC/RSV) was a gift from Dr. R. Davis (University of Massachusetts, Worcester, MA) and has been previously described (41Raingeaud J. Whitmarsh A.J. Barrett T. Derijard B. Davis R.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1247-1255Crossref PubMed Scopus (1150) Google Scholar). The expression vector MKK3(ala) in pRC/RSV encodes a mutant MAPK kinase 3 which acts as a dominant negative and prevents p38 MAPK activation. The GFP expression vector pEGFP-N1 was purchased from Clontech. HuH7 cells were transiently transfected using Lipofect-AMINE as previously described (19Muhlenbeck F. Haas E. Schwenzer R. Schubert G. Grell M. Smith C. Scheurich P. Wajant H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33091-33098Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). In brief, cells grown in 12-well dishes were transfected by adding 0.5 ml of Opti-MEM I containing 3 μl of LipofectAMINE (Invitrogen), 4 μl of PLUSReagent (Invitrogen), and 0.8 μg of DNA each, MKK3(ala) (0.6 μg) and pEGFP-N1 (0.2 μg). Control cells were transfected with 0.8 μg of pEGFP-N1. The cells were incubated in the above mixture for 5 h at 37 °C in a 5% CO2, 95% air incubator. After this incubation, the media was changed to Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum. Twenty-four hours later, the cells were incubated with deoxycholate in serum-free media for 12 h. Transfected cells were identified by their green fluorescence, and the transfection efficiency was ∼30–40% for all plasmids as estimated by the percentage of cells expressing GFP. The rate of apoptosis in transfected cells was evaluated by 4′,6-diamidino-2phenylindolehydrochloride (DAPI) staining and counting of apoptotic nuclei under fluorescent microscopy as described below. Short Interfering RNA and Transfection—Short interfering RNA (siRNA), a specific double-stranded 21-nucleotide RNA sequence homologous to the target gene, was used to silence FADD expression. siRNA for FADD was designed and synthesized using the software 2www.ambion.com. and Silencer™ siRNA construction kit from Ambion (Austin, TX) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The sequence of the double stranded RNA employed to block FADD expression in the current experiments is AATGCGTTCTCCTTCTCTGTGCCTGTC. Inhibition of FADD protein expression was assessed by immunoblot analysis following transfection of HuH7 cells with FADD-siRNA. Briefly, HuH7 cells were grown in 10-cm dishes and transiently transfected with 20 nm siRNA using 8 μl of siPORT Amine (Ambion Inc.) in a total transfection volume of 0.5 ml of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum. After incubation at 37 °C, 5% CO2 for 5 h, 1.5 ml of normal growth media was added. Before incubation with deoxycholate cells were serum starved for 24 h. Samples were then prepared and analyzed for apoptosis or by immunoblot as described below. Quantitation of Apoptosis—Apoptosis was quantified by assessing the characteristic nuclear changes of apoptosis (i.e. chromatin condensation and nuclear fragmentation) using the nuclear binding dye DAPI and fluorescence microscopy. Measurement of Intracellular Caspase Activity—HuH7 and HuH-cFLIP cells were grown on 35-mm glass-bottom microwell dishes (Mattek Corp., Ashland, MA) at a density of 1000 cells/dish. Intracellular total caspase activity was measured in single cells using the fluorophore-tagged pancaspase inhibitor carboxyfluorescein-VAD-fmk (FAM-VAD-fmk, CaspaTag; Intergen Co., Purchase, NY) according to the manufacturer's instructions, and fluorescence was evaluated with an inverted fluorescence microscope (Axiovert 35M; Carl Zeiss Inc., Thornwood, NY) using excitation and emission wavelengths of 490 and 520 nm, respectively. Digital images were captured and then analyzed and quantitated using fluorescent imaging software (Metafluor Imaging System; Universal Imaging Corp., West Chester, PA). Fluorescence intensity for individual cells was quantitated and the average fluorescent intensity determined for 100 cells per group. Immunoblot Analysis—Cells were lysed by incubation on ice for 30 min in lysis buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 1% Triton X-100, 150 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1 mm Na3VO4, 50 mm NaF, 100 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and a commercial protease inhibitor mixture (Complete-Mini Protease Inhibitor Mixture; Roche Diagnostics). After insoluble debris was pelleted by centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C, the supernatants were collected. Samples were resolved by 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, transferred to nitrocellulose membrane, and blotted with appropriate antibodies at a dilution of 1:1000. Peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (BIOSOURCE International, Camarillo, CA.) were used at a dilution of 1:2000 to 1:10000. Bound antibody was visualized using chemiluminescent substrate (ECL; Amersham Biosciences) and exposed to Kodak X-Omat film. Primary antibodies used included anti-p38 MAPK, anti-active p38 MAPK, anti-active JNK 1/2, anti-active p42/44 MAPK, anti-cFLIP, and anti-FADD. Immunoprecipitation Assay—HuH7 cells in 10-cm dishes were incubated with deoxycholate (100 μm) for 4 h. Cells were lysed with the lysis buffer as described above (immunoblot analysis). After the protein concentration in the extracts was determined, cell lysates containing 4 mg of protein in 0.5 ml of lysis buffer were precleared by incubation with 30 μl of Sepharose-CL 4B for 3 h at 4 °C. cFLIP and p38 protein were immunoprecipitated by incubation with rat monoclonal (IgG2a) anti-cFLIP (Alexis) antibody (5 μg) or rabbit anti-total p38 MAPK antibody (Santa Cruz) and protein G-Sepharose (30 μl) for an additional 2hat4 °C. Immune complexes were pelleted by centrifugation for 5 min at 14,000 × g, washed five times with lysis buffer, and released from the beads by boiling for 5 min in SDS sample buffer. Samples were resolved by SDS-PAGE, and immunoblot analysis was performed as described above. Statistical Analysis—All data represent at least three independent experiments and are expressed as the mean ± S.D. unless otherwise indicated. Differences between groups were compared using analysis of variance for repeated measures and a post-hoc Bonferroni test to correct for multiple comparisons. p38 MAPK Is Phosphorylated and Contributes to Apoptosis following DC Treatment of HuH-7 Cells—Initially, the effect of DC on MAPK activation in HuH-7 cells was examined. As has been observed in other liver cell types, DC (100 μm) treatment of HuH-7 cells resulted in phosphorylation and, therefore, activation of all three MAPKs including JNK 1/2, p38 MAPK, and p42/44 MAPK (Fig. 1A). Next, the potential contribution of these MAPKs in DC-induced apoptosis was ascertained by employing selective pharmacologic inhibitors for JNK 1/2, p38 MAPK, and p42/44 MAPK. Neither the JNK 1/2 inhibitor SP600125 (10 to 20 μm) nor the p42/44 MAPK inhibitor UO126 (10 to 20 μm) reduced DC-mediated apoptosis (Fig. 1B). In contrast, the p38 MAPK inhibitor SB203580 (20 μm) significantly attenuated DC-induced apoptosis. To further confirm a role for p38 MAPK in bile acid-mediated apoptosis, we blocked p38 expression using a dominant negative MKK3, an upstream activator of p38 MAPK (42Derijard B. Raingeaud J. Barrett T. Wu I.H. Han J. Ulevitch R.J. Davis R.J. Science. 1995; 267: 682-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (1415) Google Scholar). Transient transfection of HuH-7 cells with dominant negative MKK3 inhibited DC-induced apoptosis (Fig. 1C). Collectively, these data implicate a role for p38 MAPK, but not JNK 1/2 or p42/44 MAPK, in DC-induced apoptosis. Enhanced cFLIP Expression Prevents p38 MAPK Phosphorylation and Apoptosis following DC Treatment of HuH7 Cells—Having demonstrated that p38 MAPK contributes to bile acid-induced apoptosis, the relationship between p38 MAPK and bile acid-associated cytotoxic death receptor signaling was examined. The HuH7 cells employed for these studies express TRAIL receptors-1 and -2, tumor necrosis factor receptor-1, but not Fas (8Higuchi H. Bronk S.F. Takikawa Y. Werneburg N. Takimoto R. El-Deiry W.

J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 99: 403-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (719) Google Scholar). TRAIL does not activate p38 MAPK in these cells (data not shown). Next, we employed a blocking antibody for TNF-R1 to abrogate signaling via this death receptor. Whereas the antibody did strongly inhibit TNF-α-induced p38 phosphorylation, p38 activation after DC treatment was not reduced (Fig. 2), indicating that activation of TNF-R1 by bile acid was not responsible for DC-mediated activation of this MAPK. Death receptor signaling was further perturbed using the pharmacologic pancaspase inhibitor zVAD-fmk, FADD-specific siRNA to knock down FADD expression, and enhanced cFLIP-L expression in a stably transfected cell line. Neither zVAD-fmk nor siRNA-mediated reduction in FADD expression reduced DC-associated p38 MAPK phosphorylation (Fig. 3, A and B). The decrease in FADD expression after transfection with FADD-siRNA was sufficient to inhibit TRAIL-mediated apoptosis in HuH7 cells (Fig. 3C). In contrast, in a cFLIP-L stably transfected HuH7 cell line, termed HuH-cFLIP (Fig. 4A), DC-induced p38 MAPK phosphorylation was attenuated (Fig. 4B). The effect was specific for p38 MAPK, as JNK 1/2 and p42/44 MAPK activation was not reduced. cFLIP expressing clones were also resistant to DC-mediated apoptosis, as assessed by morphological criteria and total caspase activity (Fig. 5, A and B). The discordance between the effects of cFLIP-L on blocking p38 MAPK phosphorylation and the failure of the caspase inhibitor and attenuated FADD expression to prevent this signaling event suggests that cFLIP may prevent p38 MAPK activation by a FADD/caspase-independent process.Fig. 3DC-mediated activation of p38 MAPK is caspase- and FADD-independent. A, HuH7 cells were incubated with DC (100 μm) with or without the pancaspase inhibitor zVAD-fmk (75 μm) for 4 h. Activation of p38 was assessed by immunoblot as described above. Representative results of at least three different experiments are depicted. DC-mediated p38 MAPK phosphorylation was not inhibited by zVAD-fmk. B, HuH7 cells were transfected with FADD-siRNA and incubated with 100 μm deoxycholate for 4 h. Activated and total p38 were analyzed by immunoblot using whole cell lysates containing 30 μg of protein. Representative results of at least three different experiments are depicted. DC-mediated p38 MAPK phosphorylation was not inhibited by silencing FADD expression. C, suppression of FADD protein expression and death receptor-mediated apoptosis by FADD-siRNA. After transfection of HuH7 cells with FADD-siRNA, an immunoblot for FADD and β-actin was performed to show that FADD-siRNA efficiently suppressed the expression of FADD protein. Apoptosis was evaluated after treatment of transfected cells with TRAIL for 10 h by DAPI and fluorescence microscopy. All data are expressed as mean ± S.D. from three individual experiments. TRAIL-induced apoptosis was significantly reduced in cells transfected with FADD-siRNA (p < 0.001).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Fig. 4cFLIP overexpression prevents p38 MAPK phosphorylation.

We demonstrate a critical role for FAK in the tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-induced activation of nuclear factor (NF)-κB, using FAK-deficient (FAK–/–) embryonic fibroblasts. Interestingly, TNF-induced interleukin (IL)-6 production was nearly abolished in FAK–/– fibroblasts, whereas a normal level of production was obtained in FAK+/– or FAK+/+ fibroblasts. FAK deficiency did not affect the three types of mitogen-activated protein kinases, ERK, JNK, and p38. Similarly, TNF-induced activation of activator protein 1 or NF-IL-6 was not impaired in FAK–/– cells. Of note, TNF-induced NF-κB DNA binding activity and activation of IκB kinases (IKKs) were markedly impaired in FAK–/– cells, whereas the expression of TNF receptor I or other signaling molecules such as receptor-interacting protein (RIP), tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor 2 (TRAF2), IKKα, IKKβ, and IKKγ was unchanged. Also, TNF-induced association of FAK with RIP and subsequent association of RIP with TRAF2 were not observed, resulting in a failure of RIP to recruit the IKK complex in FAK–/– cells. The reintroduction of wild type FAK into FAK–/– cells restored the interaction of RIP with TRAF2 and the IKK complex and allowed recovery of NF-κB activation and subsequent IL-6 production. Thus, we propose a novel role for FAK in the NF-κB activation pathway leading to the production of cytokines.

Cellular focal adhesion contains structural and signaling proteins that in many cases are modified by tyrosine phosphorylation (reviewed in Refs. 1Burridge K. Chrzanowska-Wodnicka M. Annu. Rev.

Essays Biochem. 1997; 32: 73-86PubMed Google Scholar). FAK is thus implicated to play important roles in signaling pathways initiated by integrins in cell migration, survival, and cell cycle regulation. In addition, FAK has also been shown to play an essential role in the survival of anchorage-dependent cells (10Frisch S.M. Vuori K. Rouslahti E. Chan-Hui P.Y. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 793-799Crossref PubMed Scopus (984) Google Scholar) or in antiapoptotic action during growth factor deprivation-induced apoptosis in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (11Levkau B. Herren B. Koyama H. Ross R. Raines E.W. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 187: 579-586Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). Overexpression of FAK in many cells induces the constitutive activation of NF-κB, which leads to the activation of survival genes as shown in human leukemic HL-60 cells, in which FAK protected cells from apoptosis caused by oxidative stress, etoposide, and ionizing radiation (12Sonoda Y.

Chen H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 26901-26906Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). These findings imply that FAK generally has an antiapoptotic role in various cells. Furthermore, FAK triggers rapid cell cycle progression via activation of protein kinase C isoforms and cyclins (16Yamamoto D. Sonoda Y. Hasegawa M. Funakoshi-Tago M. Aizu-Yokota E. Kasahara T. Cell. Signaling. 2003; 15: 575-583Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). FAK is thus phosphorylated by various stimuli and is involved in cytoplasmic signaling downstream of a variety of cell surface receptors. However, to date, no reports have described the role of FAK in inflammatory and immune responses, whereas proline-rich tyrosine kinase 2, a related adhesion focal tyrosine kinase, was found to be activated by TNF or by ultraviolet irradiation (17Tokiwa G. Dikic I. Lev S. Schlessinger J. Science. 1996; 273: 792-794Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). Mechanisms of FAK activation are multiple, and other tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins such as proline-rich tyrosine kinase 2 are present in the cells (3Schlaepfer D.D Hauck C.R. Sieg D.J. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 1999; 71: 435-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (1019) Google Scholar, 5Owen J.D. Ruest P.J. Fry D.W. Hanks S.K. Mol. Cell.

EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5933-5947Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). Thus, we investigated embryonic fibroblasts from FAK-deficient mice to study the role of FAK because FAK deficiency in mice was embryonic lethal as a result of defective developmental gastrulation events with deficits in cell migration (18Sieg D.J.

Oncogene. 1995; 11: 1989-1995PubMed Google Scholar). Our focus was the responses of FAK–/– fibroblasts to TNF-α. TNF-α is a potent inducer of IL-6 expression in fibroblasts, and we examined whether FAK–/– fibroblasts respond normally to TNF-α and produce cytokines. We found that FAK–/– fibroblasts responded poorly to stimulation with TNF-α, and therefore we examined the underlying mechanism of their unresponsiveness to TNF-α. We present evidence for the first time that a functional FAK molecule is required for IL-6 production by TNF-α. More importantly, we have uncovered the role of FAK in TNF-α-mediated NF-κB activation through its association with receptor-interacting protein (RIP), a serine/threonine kinase. Antibodies and Reagents—Mouse monoclonal antibodies against HA-peptides (12CA5), TNFRI, and RIP were purchased from Roche, R&D Systems, and New England Biolabs Inc. (Beverly, MA), respectively. Rabbit polyclonal antibodies against FAK, TNFR-associated factor 2 (TRAF2), and RelB and goat polyclonal antibody against IκB-kinase (IKK) γ were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Polyclonal anti-p65, anti-p50, and anti-c-Rel antibodies were purchased from Rockland Inc. (Gilbertsville, PA). Human recombinant TNF-α was kindly provided by Dainippon Pharmaceutical Co. (Suitashi, Osaka, Japan). Cell Culture and IL-6 Assay—Heterozygous FAK+/– and homozygous FAK–/– embryonic fibroblasts were originally established by Ilic and co-workers (19Ilic D. Furuta Y.

These cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Nissui Seiyaku, Tokyo, Japan) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, 4 mm glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin G, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. The absence of FAK in the FAK–/– fibroblasts was confirmed by immunoblot analysis using anti-FAK monoclonal antibody (Transduction Laboratories, Lexington, KY; see Fig. 6). Normal FAK+/+ mouse fibroblasts were obtained from the skin of newborn BALB/c mice by trypsinization. For the measurement of secreted IL-6, cells were incubated with or without TNF-α (10 ng/ml) in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 1% fetal bovine serum for 12–24 h. IL-6 levels in the culture supernatants were determined using a commercial ELISA kit (BIOSOURCE). All samples were assayed at least in duplicate. Transient Transfection and Luciferase Assay—HA-tagged FAK cDNA and mutant FAK cDNA subcloned into pRcCMV were originally constructed by Dr. Steven K. Hanks (22Hanks S.K. Calalb M.B. Harper M.C. Patel S.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 8487-8491Crossref PubMed Scopus (723) Google Scholar) and kindly provided to us (12Sonoda Y. Watanabe S. Matsumoto Y. Yokota-Aizu E. Kasahara T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10566-10570Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). Plasmid DNAs were transfected into FAK+/– and FAK–/– fibroblasts using LipofectAMINE TM2000 (Invitrogen). Final amounts of transfected DNA for 24-well plates were adjusted to 1 μg with empty vector, pRcCMV. 0.5 μg of pRcCMV-HA-FAK and pRcCMV-HA-FAK (K454R) was cotransfected with 0.01 μg of pRL-TK (Promega Co. Japan, Tokyo, Japan) and 0.1 μg of pNF-κB-Luc (Invitrogen). At 48 h after transfection, cells were harvested, and the luciferase activities were measured with a Lumat LB9501 (Bertold Japan, Tokyo, Japan). The efficiency of transfection was normalized with sea pansy luciferase activity as described elsewhere (23Funakoshi M. Sonoda Y. Tago K. Tominaga S.-I. Kasahara T. Int. Immunopharmcol. 2001; 1: 595-604Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitation and Immunoblot Analysis—Immunoprecipitation and immunoblot analysis were performed as described previously (23Funakoshi M. Sonoda Y. Tago K. Tominaga S.-I. Kasahara T. Int. Immunopharmcol. 2001; 1: 595-604Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 24Funakoshi M. Tago K. Sonoda Y. Tominaga S. Kasahara T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 283: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). In brief, harvested cells were lysed in lysis buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 158 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm Na3VO4, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, and 2 μg/ml leupeptin) on ice and cleaned by centrifugation to obtain whole cell extracts. Aliquots (250 μg) of cell lysate were mixed with protein G-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) and various antibodies overnight at 4 °C. The immune complexes were precipitated by centrifugation, washed five times with lysis buffer, and boiled in Laemmli sample buffer. Boiled samples were separated by SDS-PAGE, and the proteins were transfected to nitrocellulose membranes. Immunoblotting was performed with various antibodies and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit or anti-mouse IgG antibody and visualized using the enhanced chemiluminescence Western blotting detection system (Amersham Biosciences). Flow Cytometry—Flow cytometry using a fluorescence-activated cell sorter scan was done as follows. Cells were incubated with PE-conjugated rat anti-mouse TNFRI antibody (CD120a; IgG2a isotype; Immunotech, Beckman-Coulter, Marseilles, France) and the isotype-matched mouse control IgG, followed by PE-conjugated anti-mouse antibody. Stained cells were analyzed using FACSCalibur (Becton Dickinson). In Vitro Kinase Assay—Immunoprecipitates obtained with anti-IKKγ antibody were washed twice with lysis buffer and three times with kinase buffer (25 mm Hepes-NaOH, pH 7.5, 20 mm MgCl2, 20 mm β-glycerophosphate, 0.1 mm Na3VO4, 2 mm dithiothreitol, and 20 mm p-nitrophenylphosphate). The kinase reaction in 20 μl of kinase buffer including 10 μm ATP and [γ-32P]ATP was carried out with 1 μg of GST-IκBα (amino acids 1–60) as a substrate for 20 min at 30 °C. In some experiments, mutant GST-IκBαΔC (S32A, S36R) was used instead of GST-IκBα. Samples were resolved by 15% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and phosphorylated GST-IκBα was visualized by autoradiography. RNA Isolation and PCR Amplification—Total RNA separation and RT-PCR analysis were done according to the manufacturer's protocol (Takara Shuzo) using oligo(dT)20 primer and 1 μg of total RNA for first-strand cDNA synthesis. PCR was performed at an annealing temperature of 57 °C and with 20 amplification cycles. The PCR products were resolved and electrophoresed on a 1% agarose gel in Tris borate/EDTA. Primers used were as follows: mouse IL-6, 5′-GATGCTACCAAACTGGATATAATC-3′ (upstream) and 5′-GGTCCTTAGCCACTCCTTCTGTG-3′ (downstream); and mouse glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, 5′-GAGAAACCTGCCAAGTATGA-3′ (upstream) and 5′-GCCCCTCCTGTTATTA-3′ (downstream). Reconstitution of FAK by Adenoviral Infection—Cells were plated at 1 × 106 cells/ml in 6-cm culture plates and infected with adenovirus encoding β-galactosidase (Adv-LacZ) or HA-tagged wild type FAK (Adv-FAK) for 24 h at an optimal concentration of virus (25Sakurai S. Sonoda Y. Koguchi E. Shinoura N. Hamada H. Kasahara T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 293: 174-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) with 1 × 102 virions/cell (i.e. a multiplicity of infection of 100). Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay (EMSA)—EMSA was carried out as described previously (23Funakoshi M. Sonoda Y. Tago K. Tominaga S.-I. Kasahara T. Int. Immunopharmcol. 2001; 1: 595-604Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 24Funakoshi M. Tago K. Sonoda Y. Tominaga S. Kasahara T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 283: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The consensus double-strand oligodeoxynucleotide probes for NF-κB, AP-1, and NF-IL-6 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) were radioactively labeled using [γ-32P]ATP and T4 polynucleotide kinase with standard procedures. Then, 10 μg of nuclear protein prepared from cells was incubated with γ-32P-labeled double-stranded oligonucleotide probe. The binding reaction was carried out at room temperature for 30 min in a total volume of 25 μl. Bound complexes were separated on 5% gel electrophoresis in TGE (tris-glycine-EDTA) buffer, dried, and visualized by autoradiography. Defective TNF-α-induced IL-6 Production in the FAK–/– Fibroblasts—It is well documented that FAK plays important roles in the integrin signaling in cell migration, cell survival, or cell cycle regulation. We speculated that FAK might also play a role in cytokine signaling because in our preliminary studies, cytokine production was modulated in the FAK-transfected cells. In order to study the role of FAK, we obtained FAK+/– and FAK–/– embryonic fibroblasts from FAK-deficient mice, which were originally established by Ilic and co-workers (19Ilic D. Furuta Y. Kanazawa S. Takeda N. Sobue K. Nakatsuji N. Nomura S. Fujimoto J. Okada M. Yamamoto T. Nature. 1995; 377: 539-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (1576) Google Scholar, 20Furuta Y. Ilic D. Kanazawa S. Takeda N. Yamamoto T. Aizawa S. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 1989-1995PubMed Google Scholar). First, we examined TNF-α-induced IL-6 production by the FAK+/– and FAK–/– fibroblasts as well as normal mouse embryonic skin fibroblasts (FAK+/+ cells). TNF-α induced marked IL-6 production in both FAK+/+ and FAK+/– fibroblasts, whereas only marginal IL-6 production (one-fifth or one-sixth that of FAK+/+ fibroblasts at 24 h) was observed by the FAK–/– fibroblasts, as shown in Fig. 1A. RT-PCR analysis also indicated that virtually no IL-6 mRNA was expressed in FAK–/– cells, whereas a substantial level of IL-6 mRNA was expressed in the FAK+/– and FAK+/+ cells, suggesting some critical role for FAK (Fig. 1B). This observation prompted us to further explore the role of FAK in the TNF-α-induced signaling pathway. Because significant expression of IL-6 in response to TNF-α was seen in FAK+/– as well as wild type normal FAK+/+ fibroblasts, we used FAK+/– cells and FAK–/– cells in the subsequent studies. FAK Has No Effect on the TNF-α-induced MAP Kinase Pathway or Activation of AP-1 and NF-IL-6 —TNF-α has been implicated in the activation of one or more MAP kinases in different cell types for the induction of IL-6 production (26Beyaert R. Cuenda A. Vanden Berghe W. Plaisance S. Lee J.C. Haegeman G. Cohen P. Fiers W. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1914-1923Crossref PubMed Scopus (598) Google Scholar). To explore the possible involvement of the MAP kinase family in FAK function, we determined whether three types of MAP kinases (ERK, c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK), and p38) are activated (i.e. phosphorylated or not) using antibodies against each phosphorylated form. Activated forms of all types of MAP kinases were detected equally in the FAK–/– cells as well as in the FAK+/– cells in response to TNF-α (data not shown), indicating that the MAP kinase activation pathway is not involved in the critical role of FAK. AP-1, NF-IL-6, and NF-κB binding elements are known to be involved in activating the IL-6 gene (27Tuyt L.M. Dokter W.H. Birkenkamp K. Koopmans S.B. Lummen C. Kruijer W. Vellenga E. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 4893-4902PubMed Google Scholar, 28Matsusaka T. Fujikawa K. Nishio Y. Mukaida N. Matsushima K. Kishimoto T. Akira S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 10193-10197Crossref PubMed Scopus (871) Google Scholar). AP-1 can be activated directly through phosphorylation by JNK, and the expression of AP-1 components is induced through JNK- and p38-dependent pathways (29Karin M. Liu Z. Zandi E. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 240-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (2267) Google Scholar). To assess the effect of FAK on AP-1 activation, we measured AP-1 activity with an EMSA, using oligonucleotide probes for AP-1. As shown in Fig. 2A, TNF-α induced marked AP-1 DNA binding activity in both FAK+/– and FAK–/– cells, which is consistent with the results on the activation of MAP kinase. Binding specificity for AP-1 was confirmed by the complete disappearance with non-radiolabeled DNA (Fig. 2B). Similarly, NF-IL-6 activation was equally observed in FAK+/– and FAK–/– cells (Fig. 2, C and D), indicating that FAK is not directly involved in the activation of NF-IL-6. Impairment of TNF-α-induced NF-κB Activation in FAK–/– Cells—Because TNF-α is a potent activator of NF-κB, which is one of the transcription factors necessary for activating the IL-6 gene, we tested the activation of NF-κB using an EMSA as well as the reporter gene assay. The EMSA indicated that TNF-α induced rapid and marked NF-κB DNA binding activity within 15 min in the FAK+/– cells, whereas only low level induction was observed in FAK–/– cells (Fig. 3A). A supershift assay revealed that the NF-κB DNA binding proteins are mostly p65 and less abundant p50 or c-Rel, as shown in Fig. 3B. This observation was also confirmed by the translocation of activated NF-κB components to the nucleus, as shown by immunoblotting. That is, whereas p65, p50, and c-Rel proteins were detected at 15 min in nuclear extracts from the TNF-α-stimulated FAK+/– cells, these proteins were not detected in FAK–/– cells (Fig. 3C). In addition, significant NF-κB luciferase activity was detected in the FAK+/– cells, whereas only minimal NF-κB activation was observed in FAK–/– cells (Fig. 3D). Thus, FAK appears to facilitate TNF-α signaling by modulating NF-κB activation, which is not dependent on the MAP kinase pathway. IKK Activity Is Severely Impaired in the FAK–/– Fibroblasts—Because the activation of IKK is a key step in the activation of NF-κB, we examined whether the activation of IKK by TNF-α differs between FAK+/– and FAK–/– cells. It was found that activation by TNF-α was severely impaired in FAK–/– cells when the IKK complex was immunoprecipitated with anti-IKKγ (NEMO) antibody, and IKK activity was measured as IκBα phosphorylation using GST-IκBαΔC as a substrate (Fig. 4A, top lane). No phosphorylation was observed when the GST-IκBαΔC (S32A, S36R) mutant was used as a substrate (Fig. 4A, bottom lane). Furthermore, when the degradation of IκBα after stimulation with TNF-α was examined by Western blotting, it was found to be reduced significantly in FAK–/– cells (Fig. 4B), confirming the impairment of IKK activation in FAK–/– cells. Because these results suggested that FAK plays essential roles in the activation of NF-κB, we further evaluated the expression levels of several upstream molecules involved in TNF-α-induced NF-κB activation including TNFRI, RIP, TRAF2, IKKα, IKKβ, and IKKγ. As shown in Fig. 4C, no significant differences between FAK+/– and FAK–/– cells were observed. Therefore, the defective NF-κB activation in FAK–/– cells was not due to altered expression of signaling molecules in the TNF-α signaling pathway. Because the TNFRI detected by Western blotting might be a non-glycosylated form of the TNFRI precursor, we also analyzed the expression of the mature form of TNFRI on the cell surface. As shown in Fig. 4D, similar levels of cell surface TNFRI were observed in both FAK+/– and FAK–/– cells, confirming that there were no significant differences between these two cell lines in terms of TNFRI expression. Critical Interaction of FAK with RIP—Because IKK activity was severely impaired in FAK–/– cells, we examined whether FAK physically interacts with RIP, which is essential for the TNFRI-mediated activation of IKKs (31Rothwarf D.M. Zandi E. Natoli G. Karin M. Nature. 1998; 395: 297-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (836) Google Scholar, 32Ilic D. Damsky C H. Yamamoto T. J.

Coimmunoprecipitation assay revealed that FAK associated with RIP in a TNF-α-dependent manner in FAK+/– cells, but not in FAK–/– cells (Fig. 5A). Inversely, in a pull-down assay using anti-RIP antibody, RIP also coimmunoprecipitated with FAK, confirming the physical association of FAK and RIP (Fig. 5B). The TNF-α-dependent association of TNFRI with FAK and with RIP was demonstrated clearly in FAK+/– cells but not in FAK–/– cells (Fig. 5C). In addition, TRAF2 antibody coimmunoprecipitated with RIP (Fig. 5D), which has been demonstrated by Hsu et al. (30Hsu H. Huang J. Shu H.B. Baichwal V. Goeddel D.V. Immunity. 1996; 4: 387-396Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (964) Google Scholar), only in FAK+/– cells. Furthermore, we found that IKKγ, which is an essential component of the IκB kinase complex (31Rothwarf D.M. Zandi E. Natoli G. Karin M. Nature. 1998; 395: 297-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (836) Google Scholar), recruited RIP in response to TNF-α (Fig. 5E), which appears to be an important step in the activation of TRAF2 (33Hsu H. Xiong J. Goeddel D.V. Cell. 1995; 81: 495-504Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1721) Google Scholar, 34Hsu H. Shu H.B. Pan M.G. Goeddel D.V. Cell. 1996; 84: 299-308Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1719) Google Scholar). It should be noted that a significant association of RIP with TRAF2 and IKKγ was observed in FAK+/– cells but not in FAK–/– cells, thus demonstrating the critical role of FAK in the physical association of RIP, TRAF2, and IKKγ. Rescue of the Deficient Phenotype in FAK–/– Fibroblasts by the Reintroduction of Wild Type FAK cDNA—To confirm that the defect in the interaction of RIP with TNFRI, TRAF2, and the IKK complex in FAK–/– cells was due to the disruption of FAK function, we examined whether the above interactions could be rescued in FAK–/– cells by the forced expression of wild type FAK. We thus reintroduced wild type FAK into FAK–/– cells using an adenovirus vector harboring FAK cDNA. As shown in Fig. 6A, FAK expression, in contrast to the Lac Z control, restored TNF-α-induced interaction between RIP and TNFRI as determined by coimmunoprecipitation assay. In addition, FAK expression also recovered the recruitment of TRAF2 and IKKγ to RIP (Fig. 6, B and C). To further ascertain the effect of FAK on the activation of NF-κB, we determined the NF-κB DNA binding activity with an EMSA. As shown in Fig. 7A, reintroduction of wild type FAK into the FAK–/– cells restored TNF-α-induced NF-κB DNA binding activity to the levels seen in FAK+/– cells (Fig. 3A). The restoration of NF-κB activation by the reintroduction of FAK was confirmed using the NF-κB reporter gene assay (Fig. 7B), as compared with that in Fig. 3D. Furthermore, introduction of FAK in FAK–/– cells resulted in a significant increase of IL-6 secretion and IL-6 mRNA expression (Fig. 7, C and D). It should be noted that mutated FAK (K454R), a kinase-defective mutant, did not restore TNF-α-induced NF-κB activation (Fig. 7B). Therefore, wild type FAK with intact kinase activity is necessary for the TNF-α-triggered FAK-associated signal pathways. In this study, we demonstrated that TNF-α-induced NF-κB activation and subsequent IL-6 gene activation were severely impaired in FAK–/– cells. These observations indicated that FAK plays a critical role in the TNF-α-mediated signal transduction pathway. Because our results demonstrated that FAK is indispensable for the TNF-α-induced IL-6 gene activation pathway, we focused on the signaling molecules with which FAK may interact. Whereas FAK is at a crossroad for multiple signaling pathways (32Ilic D. Damsky C H. Yamamoto T. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 401-407Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), neither its role in the production of cytokines nor its intervention in the signals leading to the activation of cytokine genes has been studied thus far.

Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 249-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (1044) Google Scholar) demonstrated that FAK integrates growth factors (platelet-derived growth factor and epidermal growth factor) and integrin signals to promote cell migration and suggested a role as a receptor-proximal link between the growth factor receptor and integrin signaling pathway. However, the role of FAK in the activation"

PnIA and [A10L]PnIA inhibited acetylcholine (ACh)-activated currents at wtα7 receptors with IC50 values of 349 and 168 nm, respectively. Rates of onset of inhibition were similar for PnIA and [A10L]PnIA; however, the rate of recovery was slower for [A10L]PnIA, indicating that the increased potency of [A10L]PnIA at α7 receptors is conveyed by its slower rate of dissociation from the receptors. All the alanine mutants of [A10L]PnIA inhibited ACh-activated currents at wtα7 receptors. Insertion of an alanine residue between position 5 and 13 and at position 15 significantly reduced the ability of [A10L]PnIA to inhibit ACh-evoked currents. PnIA inhibited the non-desensitizing ACh-activated currents at α7-L247T receptors with an IC50 194 nm. In contrast, [A10L]PnIA and the alanine mutants potentiated the ACh-activated current α7-L247T receptors and in addition [A10L]PnIA acted as an agonist. PnIA stabilized the receptor in a state that is non-conducting in both the wild type and mutant receptors, whereas [A10L]PnIA stabilized a state that is non-conducting in the wild type receptor and conducting in the α7-L247T mutant. These data indicate that the change of a single amino acid side-chain, at position 10, is sufficient to change the toxin specificity for receptor states in the α7-L247T mutant.

Conotoxins are short peptides isolated from the venom of predatory marine snails of the genus Conus. Many of these toxins are selective inhibitors of ligand- and voltage-gated ion channels and are classified according to the type of channel to which they bind. This high selectivity of the conotoxins has lead to a great interest in the use of these molecules as pharmacological tools and the design of novel therapeutics. Much of this work has been summarized in several recent reviews (1Adams D.J. Alewood P.F. Craik D.J. Drinkwater R. Lewis R.J. Drug Dev.

Native nAChRs are composed of a number of distinct subunits, which combine to form functional receptors each with distinct pharmacological properties. The α-conotoxins contain 4 cysteines, which in their natural conformation form disulphide bridges giving the molecule a globular two-loop configuration with sidechains projecting from a rigid backbone. The α-conotoxin PnIA, isolated from the molluscivourous cone snail Conus pennaceus, is 16 amino acids long, and the x-ray crystal structure shows an α-helix between residues 5 and 12 and a 310 helical turn at the N-terminal end (5Hu S.H.

PnIA has been demonstrated to be a competitive inhibitor of native nAChRs in cultured Aplysia neurons (6Fainzilber M. Hasson A. Oren R. Burlingame A.L. Gordon D. Spira M.E. Zlotkin E.

Cartier G.E. Olivera B.M. Yoshikami D. McIntosh J.M. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 14542-14548Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar) with poor selectivity between receptor subtypes. A leucine for alanine substitution at position 10 makes the toxin a highly selective inhibitor of the α7 nAChR subtype (7Hogg R.C. Miranda L.P. Craik D.J. Lewis R.J. Alewood P.F. Adams D.J. J. Biol.

Since the A10L mutation in PnIA changes the selectivity of the toxin for receptor subtypes, it is also possible that the mechanism of inhibition differs between PnIA and [A10L]PnIA, the A10L mutation may cause the toxins to have different affinities for different states of the receptor.Table ISequences of α-conotoxins PnIA and [A10L]PnIA The nAChRs have been presented as a prototype of allosteric membrane protein (9Changeux J.P. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1990; 11: 485-492Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar) as described by the Monod-Wyman-Changeux model of allosteric interactions (10Monod J. Wyman J. Changeux J.P. J. Mol. Biol. 1965; 12: 88-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (6130) Google Scholar) in which the structure of the molecule moves in concerted transitions between pre-existing conformational states. The protein can exist in different states and undergoes spontaneous conformational transitions, in the absence of a ligand the equilibrium between these conformational states is in favor of the resting (closed) state. Exposure to an agonist preferentially stabilizes the receptor in the active (open) and desensitized (closed) states, whereas the binding of an antagonist molecule binds to and stabilizes the molecule in a closed (resting or desensitized) state (see Ref. 11Edelstein S.J. Schaad O. Henry E. Bertrand D. Changeux J.P. Biol. Cybern. 1996; 75: 361-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). In such a model, transition from one state to another depends upon both the presence of a ligand and/or the isomerization coefficient, which governs changes between states. Binding of a molecule at a site distinct from the agonist-binding site may modify the isomerization coefficient, thus affecting agonist or antagonist behavior. Molecules acting in this way are known as allosteric effectors (10Monod J. Wyman J. Changeux J.P. J. Mol. Biol. 1965; 12: 88-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (6130) Google Scholar). To test whether mutations of PnIA affected the inhibitory mechanism of the toxin, we examined the effects of PnIA, [A10L]PnIA and alanine scan mutants of [A10L]PnIA at wild type homomeric chick α7 receptors (wtα7) and at chick α7 receptors with the L247T mutation (α7-L247T) expressed in Xenopus oocytes. α7-L247T receptors display non-desensitizing currents in response to agonist application (12Bertrand D.

Revah F. Galzi J.L. Hussy N. Mulle C. Bertrand S. Ballivet M. Changeux J.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 1261-1265Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar), this mutant receptor can be used as a tool to determine whether the same closed state of the receptor is stabilized by PnIA and [A10L]PnIA, allowing us to probe states of the receptor which are otherwise electrophysiologically silent in the wild type receptor. To test the contribution of projecting side-chains at other positions to the activity of [A10L]PnIA, we have replaced each of the residues in turn with an alanine to observe the effects of this mutation on toxin activity. Circular dichroism spectra and 1H NMR experiments have shown that substitution of individual residues in [A10L]PnIA with an alanine do not result in perturbation of the global fold, 2R. C. Hogg, G. Hopping, P. F. Alewood, D. J. Adams, and D. Bertrand, unpublished results.2R. C. Hogg, G. Hopping, P. F. Alewood, D. J. Adams, and D. Bertrand, unpublished results. thus, any changes in activity in these molecules can be directly correlated to the interactions of the projecting side chains with the nAChR. Electrophysiology—Xenopus oocytes were prepared and injected as described previously (17Bertrand D. Cooper E. Valera S. Rungger D. Ballivet M. Methods Neurosci. 1991; 4: 174-193Crossref Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Two-electrode voltage clamp recordings were made 2–3 days after cDNA injection. During recordings the bath solution was OR2 medium containing (in mm), NaCl, 82.5; KCl, 2.5; CaCl, 2.5; MgCl, 1; atropine, 0.5; HEPES, 5, adjusted to pH 7.4 with NaOH. ACh was applied in a fast flowing solution stream (∼6 ml/min). Unless indicated, oocytes were incubated in 100 μm BAPTA-AM for at least 2 h prior to recording. Two-electrode voltage clamp recordings were carried out using a GeneClamp 500B amplifier (Axon Instruments Inc., Union City, CA), recording electrodes contained 3 mm KCl and oocytes were clamped at –100 mV throughout the experiments. Experiments were carried out at 18 °C. Dose-response curves for toxin inhibition were fit with the equation y = 1/1 + ([toxin]/(IC50)n), where y is the normalized response, [toxin] is the toxin concentration, and n is the Hill coefficient. Measurements of rates of toxin block and recovery were carried out at toxin concentrations close to the IC50. Data points for onset of block were fit with the equation y = A e –t/τ + B, where A = control amplitude normalized to 1, B = current amplitude following block expressed as a fraction of the control current, and t = time. Curves were fit using a χ2 minimization fitting routine in Microcal origin 5.0 (Microcal software inc.). Data are presented as mean ± S.E. Toxin Synthesis—The 16-residue peptides were synthesized manually on a 0.50-mmol scale using HBTU activation of t-butoxycarbonylamino acids with in situ neutralization chemistry as described previously (18Schnolzer M. Alewood P. Jones A. Alewood D. Kent S.B. Int. J. Pept. Protein Res. 1992; 40: 180-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (938) Google Scholar). The syntheses were performed on p-methylbenzhydrylamine resin using standard amino acid side chain protection. Each residue was coupled for 10 min and coupling efficiencies determined by the quantitative ninhydrin reaction (18Schnolzer M. Alewood P. Jones A. Alewood D. Kent S.B. Int. J. Pept. Protein Res. 1992; 40: 180-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (938) Google Scholar). Prior to a standard HF cleavage (10 ml of p-cresol:p-thiocresol:HF 1:1:8 (0 °C, 2 h) and workup (18Schnolzer M. Alewood P. Jones A. Alewood D. Kent S.B. Int. J. Pept. Protein Res. 1992; 40: 180-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (938) Google Scholar), the N-terminal t-butoxycarbonyl protecting group was removed (100% trifluoroacetic acid), and the resin was successively washed with dimethylformamide and dichloromethane. Air oxidations were carried out by dissolving the lyophilized purified A10L[PnIA] analogues in 0.1 m NH4HCO3/isopropyl alcohol (pH 8.25) with vigorous stirring at room temperature overnight. Prior to purification the solution was acidified to pH 3 with trifluoroacetic acid and analyzed by analytical C4 HPLC using a linear gradient of 0–80% solvent B at 1%/min while monitoring by UV absorbance at 214 nm and electronspray mass spectrometry. Oxidized material was then purified by semipreparative HPLC using the same chromatographic conditions. PnIA and [A10L]PnIA Inhibit ACh-induced Currents at Chick α7 nAChR Receptors—The effects of PnIA were investigated on chick α7 nAChR receptors expressed in Xenopus oocytes. Membrane currents were activated with 200 μm ACh, which is close to the EC50 (115 μm) for these receptors (19Revah F. Bertrand D. Galzi J.L. Devillers-Thiery A. Mulle C. Hussy N. Bertrand S. Ballivet M. Changeux J.P. Nature. 1991; 353: 846-849Crossref PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar). PnIA inhibited ACh-induced currents in a concentration-dependent and reversible manner (Fig. 1A). The dose-response relationship is shown in Fig. 1B; the fitted curve had an IC50 of 349 nm and a slope of 1.8. The position 10 mutant of PnIA, [A10L]PnIA, has previously been reported to inhibit ACh-induced currents at rat α7 receptors expressed in Xenopus oocytes (8Luo S. Nguyen T.A. Cartier G.E. Olivera B.M. Yoshikami D. McIntosh J.M. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 14542-14548Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar) and native α7 receptors in rat parasympathetic ganglion neurons (7Hogg R.C. Miranda L.P. Craik D.J. Lewis R.J. Alewood P.F. Adams D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36559-36564Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). [A10L]PnIA was twice as potent as PnIA to inhibit ACh-activated currents at chick α7 receptors (Fig. 1C). Dose-response relationship was fit by a curve with an IC50 value of 168 nm and a slope of 1.55 (Fig 1D). Rate of Block and Recovery—The rate of onset and recovery from block of ACh-activated currents at α7 receptors was measured for PnIA and [A10L]PnIA. As PnIA competes with ACh at the binding site, ACh was applied for 2 s, and it was assumed that these short applications of ACh did not displace the toxin. Toxin concentrations used were close to the respective IC50 values. The rate of block with PnIA (400 nm) followed an exponential time course with a τonset of 11.3 s (Fig. 2A). An exponential rate of block and recovery would suggest that the reaction is bimolecular. However, as the Hill coefficient for PnIA inhibition is greater than unity (Fig. 1B), more than one toxin binding site must be present. Since the homomeric α7 receptor contains five putative agonist binding sites, we tried to fit the data using a scheme similar to MLA blockade of the α7 receptor (20Palma E. Bertrand S. Binzoni T. Bertrand D. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1996; 491: 151-161Crossref Scopus (192) Google Scholar). If the occupation of a single binding site is sufficient to prevent activation of the receptor by an agonist, then the onset of block will follow an exponential time course. However, recovery from block requires that all of the binding sites are unoccupied, causing an initial lag in the recovery. Palma et al. (20Palma E. Bertrand S. Binzoni T. Bertrand D. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1996; 491: 151-161Crossref Scopus (192) Google Scholar) found that the recovery of block from MLA was best fit by a five-site model. Since the time course of recovery from MLA inhibition is ∼10-fold slower than recovery from [A10L]PnIA and more than 20-fold slower than PnIA, this makes it likely that any lag in the recovery would not be resolved at our sampling interval of 1, 5, and 10 s. Thus the recovery describes only the dissociation of the last toxin molecule from the receptor. The time to half-recovery from PnIA inhibition was in the region of 15 s. The onset of block of [A10L]PnIA (200 nm) also followed an exponential time course with a τonset of 12.0 s and had a slower half-recovery time in the region of 70 s (Fig. 3, C and D). Fitting the data with a five site model (see Equation 3 from Ref. 20Palma E. Bertrand S. Binzoni T. Bertrand D. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1996; 491: 151-161Crossref Scopus (192) Google Scholar), using approximate rates of K off and K on from Fig. 2, A and B, and Fig. 3, A and B, did not describe the data better than the Hill equations in Fig. 1, B and D, indicating that this model is not appropriate to describe the interaction of PnIA and [A10L]PnIA with the receptor. The observation that brief (0.5 or 1 s) applications or low concentrations of PnIA and [A10L]PnIA increased the peak current amplitude above control values indicate that the scheme involving binding is complex, and this may affect the fit to the data. [A10L]PnIA Alanine Mutants—To investigate the contribution of amino acid side chains in the [A10L]PnIA molecule to the inhibitory potency at α7 receptors, we examined a series of alanine mutants of [A10L]PnIA. All alanine mutants of [A10L]PnIA significantly inhibited currents at wtα7 receptors (p < 0.05). Fig. 4 shows a comparison of the inhibitory effects of the [A10L]PnIA alanine mutants (200 nm) on chick α7 nAChRs. Removal of the projecting side chains between position 5 and 13 and at position 15, by the insertion of an alanine residue, significantly reduced the potency of 200 nm [A10L]PnIA to inhibit ACh-evoked currents (p < 0.05). PnIA and [A10L]PnIA Have Different Effects on α7-L247T Receptors—The ability of PnIA and [A10L]PnIA to inhibit currents mediated by the wtα7 receptor indicates that they stabilize a state of the receptor which is non-conducting. Since the A10L mutation changes the selectivity of the toxin for receptor subtypes (7Hogg R.C. Miranda L.P. Craik D.J. Lewis R.J. Alewood P.F. Adams D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36559-36564Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 8Luo S. Nguyen T.A. Cartier G.E. Olivera B.M. Yoshikami D. McIntosh J.M. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 14542-14548Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar), it is possible that the mechanism of inhibition may also be different. In the minimal hypothetical gating scheme for a nAChR shown in Fig. 5, this could be either the resting or the desensitized state (D), which are both non-conducting in the wtα7 receptor. To investigate whether PnIA and [A10L]PnIA stabilize the same state of the receptor, we used the chick α7 receptor containing the L247T mutation. α7-L247T receptors display non-desensitizing currents in response to ACh, and it has been proposed that the L247T mutation causes one of the desensitized states of the receptor to become conducting (12Bertrand D. Devillers-Thiery A. Revah F. Galzi J.L. Hussy N. Mulle C. Bertrand S. Ballivet M. Changeux J.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 1261-1265Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar); this desensitized open state is represented as D* in Fig. 5 and could account for the non-desensitizing current. It has been proposed that it is this state of the receptor that is stabilized by nAChR antagonists, such as DHβE, which activate currents at this receptor (14Bertrand S. Devillers-Thiery A. Palma E. Buisson B. Edelstein S.J. Corringer P.J. Changeux J.P. Bertrand D. Neuroreport. 1997; 8: 3591-3596Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Occasionally, slow desensitization of α7-L247T receptors is observed, making it likely that other desensitized non-conducting states of the receptor also exist. The α7-L247T receptors exhibited a slowly activating, non-desensitizing current in response to ACh which reached a plateau within ∼10 s. α7-L247T receptors show an increased sensitivity to ACh compared with wild type receptors with an EC50 of 0.62 μm (14Bertrand S. Devillers-Thiery A. Palma E. Buisson B. Edelstein S.J. Corringer P.J. Changeux J.P. Bertrand D. Neuroreport. 1997; 8: 3591-3596Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 19Revah F. Bertrand D. Galzi J.L. Devillers-Thiery A. Mulle C. Hussy N. Bertrand S. Ballivet M. Changeux J.P. Nature. 1991; 353: 846-849Crossref PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar). PnIA inhibited the ACh-induced current through α7-L247T receptors in a concentration-dependent and reversible manner (Fig. 6A). The dose-response relationship was fit by a curve with an IC50 of 194 nm and a slope of 0.9 (Fig. 6B). A proportion of the α7-L247T receptors are spontaneously active (14Bertrand S. Devillers-Thiery A. Palma E. Buisson B. Edelstein S.J. Corringer P.J. Changeux J.P. Bertrand D. Neuroreport. 1997; 8: 3591-3596Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). PnIA also inhibited the spontaneously active “leak” current α7-L247T receptors in a concentration-dependent manner (data not shown). In contrast to the inhibitory effect of PnIA at α7-L247T receptors, co-application of [A10L]PnIA further activated the ACh-evoked current (Fig. 6C), suggesting that [A10L]PnIA and the alanine mutants stabilize a conducting state of the receptor. All the alanine mutants of [A10L]PnIA had a similar activating effect on the ACh-evoked currents at the α7-L247T receptors (see Fig. 6C and Table II). [A10L]PnIA (200 nm) increased the ACh-activated current to 1.79 ± 0.09 times control (n = 9). The mean amplitude of the [A10L]PnIA-activated current was 307 ± 196 nA (n = 9). [A10L]PnIA was also able to evoke a current at α7-L247T receptors in the absence of ACh (Fig. 6D), further suggesting that [A10L]PnIA stabilizes an “open state” of the receptor.Table IIEffect of α-conotoxins on ACh-activated currents at α7-L247T receptorsToxinActivationInhibition[A10L]PnIA+G1A+S4A+L5A+P6A+P7A+PnIA+N11A+N12A+P13A+D14A+Y15A+ Open table in a new tab The aim of this study was to investigate the molecular interactions between α-conotoxins and the α7 nAChR and to determine what effect these have on toxin activity. To this end, we have used a series of mutated toxins and compared their effects on wild type and mutant nAChRs to determine whether mutation of the native toxin changes the mechanism of inhibition, in particular the affinity for different states of the receptor. We have examined which amino acid side chains might be responsible for determining specificity of binding to different receptor states. PnIA and [A10L]PnIA both inhibit ACh-evoked currents at wtα7 receptors. [A10L]PnIA was approximately twice as potent as PnIA. The rates of onset of block were similar for both toxins, whereas recovery from block was slower for [A10L]PnIA. These data suggest that the greater potency of [A10L]PnIA at α7 receptors is conveyed by a slower rate of dissociation from the receptor. The rate of bath exchange was < 1 s, which is rapid compared with the onset of inhibition, making it unlikely that the rate of toxin binding is diffusion limited. A similar difference in off rates of PnIA and [A10L]PnIA has been observed at cloned rat α7 receptors (8Luo S. Nguyen T.A. Cartier G.E. Olivera B.M. Yoshikami D. McIntosh J.M. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 14542-14548Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Attempts to describe toxin blockade using the model proposed for MLA inhibition of α7 receptors revealed that marked differences in the profile of recovery as well as steady-state inhibition exist between α-conotoxin inhibition and MLA. The absence of a lag phase at the onset of the recovery can be attributed to either reflecting profound differences in the mechanism of inhibition or as an inability to resolve the recovery phase with adequate time resolution. Interestingly, Luo et al. (8Luo S. Nguyen T.A. Cartier G.E. Olivera B.M. Yoshikami D. McIntosh J.M. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 14542-14548Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar) have previously shown that both the onset and recovery of PnIA and [A10L]PnIA blockade can be fitted with a single exponential. However, the Hill coefficient greater than unity observed for the steady-state dose-response inhibition indicates that the toxin inhibition cannot be described by a simple bimolecular reaction. NMR analysis has shown that the A10L substitution in PnIA does not affect the backbone structure of the molecule or the angle of the projecting side chains (7Hogg R.C. Miranda L.P. Craik D.J. Lewis R.J. Alewood P.F. Adams D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36559-36564Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar); therefore, this increase in potency must be attributed to the longer aliphatic side chain of the leucine at position 10. The circular dichroism spectra of the [A10L]PnIA mutants were unchanged with regard to the native toxin, indicating that the α-helix is still present.2 All alanine mutants of [A10L]PnIA inhibited ACh-evoked currents at wtα7 receptors. The potency profile of these toxins indicates that removal of the projecting amino acid side chains between position 5 and 13 and at position 15, by the insertion of an alanine residue, reduced the potency of the [A10L]PnIA mutants to inhibit ACh-evoked currents at wtα7 receptors. The pairwise interactions involved in the binding of PnIA and PnIB to the human α7/5HT-3 receptor has been investigated by mutant cycle analysis combined with a competitive binding assay (21Quiram P.A. McIntosh J.M. Sine S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 4889-4896Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The sequences of PnIB and [A10L]PnIA are similar, differing only by a single serine in place of the asparagine residue at position 11. The residues at positions 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, and 10 were found to endow PnIB with an affinity for the α7/5HT-3 receptor. This study reported a dominant interaction between the leucine at position 10 and Trp-149 in loop B of the positive face of the ACh binding site, which anchors the toxin to the receptor, and also interactions between the proline residues at positions 6 and 7 of the toxin with the receptor. Data from the present study indicates that side chains projecting from the helical central portion of the molecule contribute to the functional blocking activity of [A10L]PnIA at α7 receptors. Since the previous study measured toxin binding in the absence of agonist (21Quiram P.A. McIntosh J.M. Sine S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 4889-4896Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) and the present study functional activity, it is possible that the toxin may be binding to different resting or desensitized states of the receptor. The modification of the projecting side chains may change the affinity of the toxin to stabilize the receptor in alternative closed states. The presence of a longer aliphatic side chain at position 10 in PnIA has been reported to increase the affinity of the toxin for α7 receptors (21Quiram P.A. McIntosh J.M. Sine S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 4889-4896Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Functional studies have shown that A10L mutation in PnIA makes the resulting [A10L]PnIA toxin more selective for α7 receptors (7Hogg R.C. Miranda L.P. Craik D.J. Lewis R.J. Alewood P.F. Adams D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36559-36564Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 8Luo S. Nguyen T.A. Cartier G.E. Olivera B.M. Yoshikami D. McIntosh J.M. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 14542-14548Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). To determine whether this mutation also changes the affinity of the toxin for different states of the α7 receptor, we used the α7-L247T mutant receptor. Two models have been proposed to account for the non-desensitizing behavior of the L247T mutant. One is that the desensitized state of the receptor becomes conducting, and another proposes that the isomerization coefficient is altered favoring the open state (22Filatov G.N. White M.M. Mol. Pharmacol. 1995; 48: 379-384PubMed Google Scholar, 23Labarca C. Nowak M.W. Zhang H. Tang L. Deshpande P. Lester H.A. Nature. 1995; 376: 514-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar, 24Palma E. Eusebi F. Miledi R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 1539-1543Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). However, this second scheme does not adequately describe how antagonists of the wtα7 receptor can act as agonists at the mutant receptor. If we assume the first model, in which the toxin is stabilizing the desensitized state of the receptor, we would expect to see a much reduced block at the α7-L247T receptor. PnIA potently inhibited ACh-induced currents at α7-L247T receptors, indicating that, as for MLA and α-bungarotoxin, it probably stabilizes the receptor in the resting state. However, in contrast, [A10L]PnIA and the [A10L]PnIA alanine scan mutants all potentiated the ACh-induced responses at the α7-L247T receptors. In addition, [A10L]PnIA was able to activate a current at α7-L247T receptors in the absence of ACh. Since [A10L]PnIA potently inhibits currents at wtα7 receptors but potentiates currents at the α7-L247T mutant, we conclude that [A10L]PnIA is stabilizing the desensitized state of the receptor that is non-conducting in the wtα7 receptor but conducting in the α7-L247T mutant. PnIA stabilizes the receptor in a state that is non-conducting in both receptors, which would correspond to the resting state. The ability of all the toxins containing the [A10L] mutation to potentiate the currents at α7-L247T receptors indicates the presence of the longer lysine side chain at position 10 alone is sufficient to change the specificity of the toxin to bind and stabilize the α7-L247T receptor in different states, and this is not affected by other mutations. The observation that the amplitude of the ACh-induced current at wtα7 receptors was increased following short 0.5–1-s applications of PnIA and [A10L]PnIA (Figs. 2A and 3A) suggests both toxins bind to the resting state of the receptor at low concentrations and increase the ratio of receptors that are in the resting as compared with the desensitized state. This effect supports the hypothesis that PnIA is stabilizing the resting state of the receptor, but also suggests that at low concentrations [A10L]PnIA may also have some affinity for a resting state of the receptor. However, since the resting and desensitized states of the wtα7 receptor are both non-conducting, there is no way to confirm that [A10L]PnIA stabilizes the same state in the wtα7 and α7-L247T receptor. Fig. 4 illustrates that the removal of side chains from residues between positions 5 and 13 reduce the potency of [A10L]PnIA to inhibit currents at α7 receptors. However, it is clear that that the removal of projecting side chains at positions other than position 10 does not affect the ability of [A10L]PnIA to potentiate responses at α7-L247T receptors. While demonstrating unambiguously the ability of [A10L]PnIA to stabilize the desensitized open state of the α7-L247T receptor, the rather complex form of the evoked current indicates that a complex equilibrium must be stabilized by the toxin. Since it is beyond the scope of this study to examine these time courses in detail, no attempt was made to analyze the profile of current decay. This study highlights the usefulness of the α-conotoxins as research tools, which can be subtly modified to probe the molecular interactions of ligand binding to nAChRs. The stability of the peptide backbone to amino acid substitutions also makes them ideal models to develop pharmacophores for nAChR subtypes, which may lead to the development of non-peptide modulators of nAChR function."

More than half of these lymphomas carry a chromosomal translocation t(2;5) leading to expression of the oncogenic tyrosine kinase nucleophosmin-anaplastic lymphoma kinase (NPM-ALK). NPM-ALK is capable of transforming fibroblasts and lymphocytes in vitro and of causing lymphomas in mice. Previously, we and others demonstrated phospholipase C-γ and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase as crucial downstream signaling mediators of NPM-ALK-induced oncogenicity. In this study, we used an ALK fusion protein as bait in a yeast two-hybrid screen identifying NIPA (nuclear interacting partner of ALK) as a novel downstream target of NPM-ALK. NIPA encodes a 60-kDa protein that is expressed in a broad range of human tissues and contains a classical nuclear translocation signal in its C terminus, which directs its nuclear localization. NIPA interacts with NPM-ALK and other ALK fusions in a tyrosine kinasedependent manner and is phosphorylated in NPM-ALK-expressing cells on tyrosine and serine residues with serine 354 as a major phosphorylation site. Overexpression of NIPA in Ba/F3 cells was able to protect from apoptosis induced by IL-3 withdrawal. Mutations of the nuclear translocation signal or the Ser-354 phosphorylation site impaired the antiapoptotic function of NIPA. In NPM-ALK-transformed Ba/F3 cells, apoptosis triggered by wortmannin treatment was enhanced by overexpression of putative dominant-negative NIPA mutants.

Receptor tyrosine kinases play an important role in the control of cell proliferation, differentiation, and malignant transformation. Receptor-specific ligands lead to their dimerization and activation with resultant auto- and cross-phosphorylation (1Pawson T. Nature. 1995; 373: 573-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (2211) Google Scholar). By mutation, truncation, or recombination, receptor tyrosine kinases may escape their strict ligand-mediated control and exhibit unregulated kinase activity, leading to constitutive activation of intracellular downstream signaling molecules and causing cell transformation and aberrant proliferation.

Despite the studies of these signaling mediators that are commonly found in association also with other receptor tyrosine kinases and non-receptor tyrosine kinases, the molecular mechanisms contributing to the distinct oncogenic features of NPM-ALK remain incompletely understood. In this study, we used an ALK fusion protein as bait in a yeast two-hybrid screen to find additional interacting partners of NPM-ALK that may be involved in mediating oncogenesis. Cloning of Human and Mouse NIPA—The complete hNIPA cDNA was isolated from a yeast two-hybrid screen with LexA-TPR-ALK as bait using a human CML K562 cDNA library (Clontech). LexA fusion proteins were created in pEG202 modified by adding the Trp selection gene. Interactions were tested in the yeast strain L40 by assaying activation of the HIS3 reporter, as described previously (23Bai R.Y. Jahn T. Schrem S. Munzert G. Weidner K.M. Wang J.Y. Duyster J. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 941-948Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). 5′-upstream stop codons were confirmed by rapid amplification for cDNA ends using a human testis cDNA library (Clontech). The mNIPA cDNA was cloned from a mouse cDNA library derived from embryos at 17 days (Clontech), based on expressed sequence tag fragments homologous to hNIPA. Accession Numbers—Homo sapiens mRNA for nuclear interacting partner of ALK (NIPA gene) was given the GenBank™ accession number AJ537494. Mus musculus mRNA for nuclear interacting partner of ALK (NIPA gene) was given the GenBank™ accession number AJ537495. Northern Blot Analysis—Northern blot analysis was carried out using a human mRNA tissue membrane (Clontech) with a probe spanning nucleotides 362–1248 of the hNIPA cDNA, according to the procedure of the ExpressHyb system (Clontech). Cell Lines—Human kidney 293 cells and monkey kidney Cos7 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine albumin (FBS). Murine pro-B lymphocyte Ba/F3 cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium with 5% FBS and 2 ng/ml mIL-3. NPM-ALK-transformed Ba/F3 cells were maintained in culture containing 5% FBS without mIL-3. Construction of Expression Plasmids and Site-directed Mutagenesis—The NPM-ALK cDNA was cloned into pcDNA3 (Invitrogen). The NIPA constructs were cloned in the pcDNA3.1-Zeo vector. Site-directed mutagenesis was performed with Pfu DNA polymerase (Stratagene, Heidelberg, Germany), as described previously (23Bai R.Y. Jahn T. Schrem S. Munzert G. Weidner K.M. Wang J.Y. Duyster J.

For GST pull-down assays, 1 × 107 cells were solubilized in lysis buffer (10 mm Tris·Hcl, pH 7.4, 5 mm EDTA, 130 mm NaCl, 1% Triton, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 10 μg/ml each of phenantroline, aprotinin, leupeptin, and pepstatin), precleared with glutathione beads and incubated with 5 μg of GST fusion proteins for 1 h at 4 °C. Protein complexes were collected on glutathione-Sepharose beads and subjected to SDS-PAGE. For competition with phosphotyrosine, lysates were incubated with the relevant GST fusion protein with free phosphotyrosine (Sigma) at a final concentration of 2 mm. Immunoprecipitation and Immunoblotting—Cells were suspended in lysis buffer and kept on ice for 30 min. Lysates were precleared by centrifugation and subjected to SDS-PAGE. Alternatively, the lysates were incubated for 2–12 h with 1–2 μg of antibody at 4 °C. Immune complexes were precipitated with 30 μl of protein A-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) for 1 h, washed three times with lysis buffer, and then boiled in 2% SDS sample buffer followed by separation on SDS-polyacrylamide gels. Immunoblotting was done with nitrocellulose membranes, and proteins were visualized by chemiluminescence, as recommended by the manufacturer (Pierce). Immunofluorescence—Cos7 cells were transfected using the 1,2-dioleoyl-3-trimethylammonium propane reagent (Roche Applied Science). After 48 h, cells were fixed and stained as described (24Hoodless P.A. Haerry T. Abdollah S. Stapleton M. O'Connor M.B. Attisano L. Wrana J.L. Cell. 1996; 85: 489-500Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (623) Google Scholar) and then visualized by fluorescence microscopy (Zeiss Axioskop) and an imaging system from TILL Photonics (Munich, Germany) as described previously (Jahn et al. (42Jahn T. Seipel P. Coutinho S. Urschel S. Schwarz K. Miething C. Serve H. Peschel C. Duyster J. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 4508-4520Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar)). In Vivo Labeling and Phosphoamino Acid Analysis—293 cells transfected with the indicated Myc-tagged NIPA constructs were cultured in phosphate-free medium containing 1% FBS and 0.2 mCi/ml [32P]orthophosphate for 2 h at 37 °C. Anti-Myc immunoprecipitation was performed, and the immune complexes were subjected to SDS-PAGE and anti-Myc immunoblotting. [32P]Myc-NIPA was visualized by autoradiography. The subsequent procedure of two-dimensional chromatography has been described previously (25Grangeasse C. Riberty M. Vaganay E. Duclos B. BioTechniques. 1999; 27: 62-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Briefly, the localized radioactive signal on the membrane was cut out and hydrolyzed in 6 n HCl for 1 h at 110 °C. Together with the mixture of O-phospho-dl-serine, -threonine, and -tyrosine serving as standards, the sample was loaded onto a thin-layer cellulose plate (Merck). Chromatography was carried out first in a solvent containing ethanol/glacial acetic acid/water (1:1:1, v/v/v) and subsequently in a solvent made of 2-methyl-1-propanol/formic acid/water (8:3:4, v/v/v). Apoptosis analysis was performed by flow cytometry. Parental Ba/F3 cells stably transfected with various NIPA constructs were cultured with murine IL-3 as growth factor. After IL-3 withdrawal, apoptosis was measured by TUNEL or propidium iodine (PI) staining. TUNEL was performed by using a Fluorescein-FragEL™ DNA fragmentation detection kit (Oncogene Research Products, Cambridge, MA), with the exposed 3′-OH ends of DNA fragments generated in response to apoptosis fluorescein isothiocyanate-fluorescein-labeled by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase. Results were evaluated on a flow cytometer at 488 nm (Beckman Coulter). Alternatively, DNA was stained with PI and analyzed by flow cytometry at 488 nm. In the studies investigating wortmannin-induced apoptosis, NPM-ALK-transformed Ba/F3 cells overexpressing the indicated NIPA constructs were incubated with 300 nm wortmannin for 3 days with daily addition of wortmannin. Every 24 h, samples were collected and analyzed by PI staining and flow cytometry. Identification of NIPA—Yeast two-hybrid screens have been utilized as a powerful method in searching for novel interacting partners of a particular protein. An essential part of such screening with a tyrosine kinase as bait is to ensure its sufficient autophosphorylation in yeast, enabling the docking of phosphorylation-dependent binding partners. A LexA-NPM-ALK fusion protein failed to be efficiently autophosphorylated in yeast (data not shown). Previous studies revealed that an artificially constructed TPR-ALK hybrid protein in which NPM was substituted with the TPR oligomerization domain displayed transforming activity similar to NPM-Alk (14Bischof D. Pulford K. Mason D.Y. Morris S.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2312-2325Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). A LexA-TPR-ALK fusion protein was shown to be efficiently autophosphorylated in yeast (data not shown), and this protein was therefore used as bait to screen a library prepared from K562, a human chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) cell line. Among the ∼400 clones isolated, more than 90% encoded an unknown protein of 60 kDa, which we have termed nuclear interacting partner of ALK (NIPA). The mouse homologue of NIPA (mNIPA) was cloned from a cDNA library prepared from mouse embryos at day 17 and was shown to share 85% amino acid identity with the human protein (Fig. 1A). NIPA was broadly expressed in the human tissues tested by Northern blot, with the highest expression in heart, skeletal muscle, and testis. In leukocytes, NIPA was detectable only at very low levels (Fig. 1B). The expression of NIPA in ALCL cells was demonstrated by identification of the gene in a cDNA library prepared from the cell line Karpas 299, which was derived from an ALK-positive ALCL patient (data not shown). NIPA Binds Only Kinase-active NPM-ALK—GST pull-down experiments showed that NIPA binds specifically to kinase-active NPM-ALK but not to the kinase-defective NPM-ALK-KD protein (Fig. 2A). Co-immunoprecipitation experiments confirmed that NIPA forms a complex only with kinase-active NPM-ALK (Fig. 2, B and C). Consistent with these findings, NIPA interacted with kinase-active TPR-ALK in yeast but not with a kinase-defective TPR-ALK (data not shown). Thus, NIPA interacts with ALK in a kinase-dependent manner. Sequence analysis of NIPA failed to show any significant homology to known proteins. Phosphotyrosine-binding motifs such as SH2 or PTB domains are absent in NIPA. The only functional motif identified in the protein is a classical NLS sequence characterized by the predominant presence of the positively charged residues Arg and Lys (Fig. 1A, the NLS is underlined). Two mutants of NIPA targeting the NLS (NIPA-KP, -RKK) were generated. In comparison with wild-type NIPA, both NLS mutants of NIPA appeared to form even more abundant complexes with NPM-ALK (Fig. 2D, lower portion). Deletion mapping delineated the binding region for NPM-ALK to amino acids 306–402 of NIPA. Deletion of these NIPA residues abolished its complex formation with NPM-ALK completely (Fig. 2D, lower portion, right lane). Likewise, a GST fusion construct of NIPA comprising amino acids 306–402 mediated binding to NPM-ALK (Fig. 2E). The association of both NIPA wild type and NIPA 306–402 to NPM-ALK was displaced upon competition with free phosphotyrosine, indicating dependence on tyrosine phosphorylation (Fig. 2E). NIPA Is a Nuclear Protein—FLAG-tagged NIPA was transiently expressed in Cos1 cells and stained by indirect immunofluorescence. The wild-type NIPA protein was found to be strictly confined to the nucleus (Fig. 3A). Exchange of 1 residue of the NLS (K399P) resulted in partial cytoplasmic redistribution of NIPA, and exchange of 3 residues (R398A,K399A, K401A) in complete cytoplasmic redistribution of NIPA (Fig. 3, B and C). NPM/B23 is a 38-kDa nuclear protein containing two NLSs that is involved in cytoplasmic/nuclear trafficking and in the control of centrosome duplication (26Michaud N. Goldfarb D.S. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 112: 215-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 27Borer R.A. Lehner C.F. Eppenberger H.M. Nigg E.A.

Fukasawa K. Cell. 2000; 103: 127-140Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (557) Google Scholar). The truncated NPM portion of NPM-ALK does not contain an NLS. However, NPM undergoes self-oligomerization (29Chan P.K. Chan F.Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1262: 37-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), as well as hetero-oligomerization with NPM-ALK, which leads to the partial nuclear localization of NPM-ALK due to shuttling by normal NPM (14Bischof D. Pulford K. Mason D.Y. Morris S.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2312-2325Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). When overexpressed in Cos1 cells, NPM-ALK is distributed mainly in the cytoplasm with a slight nuclear presence (Fig. 3D). In cells cotransfected with NPM-ALK and wild-type NIPA, both molecules retained their original patterns of subcellular localization (Fig. 3E). The NIPA-KP mutant was expressed partially in the cytoplasm and displayed co-localization with NPM-ALK also in the cytoplasm (Fig. 3F). Co-localization both in the nucleus and in the cytoplasm was also observed in cells expressing NPM-ALK and NIPA-RKK mutant (Fig. 3G). These immunofluorescence data are in agreement with our co-immunoprecipitation experiments, in which the NIPA-KP and NIPA-RKK mutants appeared to form more abundant complexes with NPM-ALK than the wild-type NIPA (Fig. 2D). A number of chromosomal translocations involving ALK have been identified in ALCL in recent years and shown to fuse ALK with a variety of N-terminal partners that mediate oligomerization and kinase activation. For example, ATIC encodes an enzyme responsible for the final steps of de novo purine nucleotide biosynthesis. In ATIC-ALK, the N-terminal 229 residues of ATIC are fused to the truncated ALK, resulting in homo-oligomerization and constitutive activation of the ATIC-ALK chimeric kinase (9Ma Z. Cools J.

Pathol. 2000; 156: 781-789Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). All ALK fusion proteins other then NPM lack a dimerization partner in the nucleus. Therefore all alternative ALK fusions are localized mainly in the cytoplasm (14Bischof D. Pulford K. Mason D.Y. Morris S.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2312-2325Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar, 31Duyster J. Bai R.Y. Morris S.W. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 5623-5637Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). We used our artificially constructed TPR-ALK (a form of dimeric ALK yet to be described in ALK positive malignancies) as representative of the ALK fusion proteins that are expressed exclusively in the cytoplasm (Fig. 3H). Co-transfection of NIPA led to a nuclear redistribution of TPR-ALK (Fig. 3I). A similar redistribution of ATIC-ALK into the nucleus was observed when ATIC-ALK and NIPA were coexpressed (data not shown). Thus, under these conditions of overexpression, nuclear-located NIPA is able to relocalize ALK fusion proteins into the nucleus. NIPA Is Phosphorylated on Serine and Tyrosine Residues— To test whether the complex formation of NIPA with kinase-active NPM-ALK leads to NIPA phosphorylation, NPM-ALK, kinase-defective NPM-ALK-KD, ATIC-ALK, or TPR-ALK were co-transfected with NIPA (Fig. 4A). All kinase-active ALK fusion proteins induced a retarded migration (shift) of NIPA on SDS-PAGE (Fig. 4A). Treatment of these cell lysates with phosphatases eliminated the shift, which was however maintained in the presence of additional phosphatase inhibitors (Fig. 4B). These results suggested that the shift is caused by the phosphorylation of NIPA. In vivo labeling of Myc-tagged NIPA with [32P]orthophosphate confirmed these results. A strong 32P signal of NIPA was observed in cells coexpressing NPM-ALK (Fig. 4C). Interestingly, phosphoamino acid analysis revealed that mainly serine residues were phosphorylated (Fig. 4D). By systematic mutation analysis, we found that alteration of serine residue 354 significantly reduced the NPM-ALK-induced gel shift of NIPA (Fig. 4E (lower panel) and F). In addition, significantly less 32P incorporation was observed into NIPA-S354A as compared with wild-type NIPA (Fig. 4E, upper panel). The NPM-ALK-induced shift could be partially restored by substituting serine 354 with aspartic acid (NIPA-S354D), which imitates a constitutively phosphorylated serine residue (Fig. 4F, left blot). Notably, NIPA-S354D was not shifted without cotransfected NPM-ALK (Fig. 4F, left blot, compare lanes 3 and 5). Together, these data suggest that phosphorylation of NIPA at serine 354 might be necessary for the concomitant phosphorylation at additional sites, which together contribute to the retarded migration on SDS-PAGE. A weak tyrosine phosphorylation signal was also detectable by phosphoamino acid analysis (Fig. 4D). In contrast to the many serine residues in hNIPA (13.7% of the total residues), only two tyrosine residues (Tyr-105, Tyr-137) are present. Both of these tyrosine residues were mutated (NIPA-YF). No alteration of the migration pattern on SDS-PAGE of this mutant was detectable (Fig. 4F, right blot). Thus, since NPM-ALK is a tyrosine kinase, the major phosphorylation of NIPA must be carried out by a yet unidentified serine kinase, which is activated in NPM-ALK expressing cells. NIPA Delays Apoptosis in Ba/F3 Cells—An important mechanism of transformation is the constitutive activation of antiapoptotic signaling pathways. We therefore investigated whether NIPA might be involved in the regulation of apoptosis. Ba/F3 cells are IL-3-dependent pro-B lymphocytes that undergo apoptosis after IL-3 withdrawal within several hours. This response is in large part a result of abrogation of the IL-3-activated antiapoptotic signaling pathway mediated by PI3-kinase/AKT (32Datta S.R. Dudek H. Tao X. Masters S. Fu H. Gotoh Y. Greenberg M.E. Cell. 1997; 91: 231-241Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4895) Google Scholar, 33del Peso L. Gonzalez-Garcia M. Page C. Herrera R. Nunez G. Science. 1997; 278: 687-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (1974) Google Scholar). Measuring apoptosis by TUNEL assay, 95% of parental Ba/F3 cells were apoptotic following 24 h of IL-3 withdrawal (Fig. 5A, filled squares). In marked contrast, overexpression of wild-type NIPA significantly suppressed apoptosis down to 20% of the assayed cells (Fig. 5A, filled circle). The NIPA-KP mutant, whose nuclear localization signal is partially disrupted, showed a reduced protective function against apoptosis as compared with cells expressing wild-type NIPA (Fig. 5A, filled triangle). Thus, NIPA is able to protect Ba/F3 cells from apoptosis induced by IL-3 withdrawal, and the correct nuclear localization of NIPA is required for this antiapoptotic function. Histograms of the flow cytometry at 0 and 24 h after IL-3 withdrawal are shown on the right of Fig. 5A. In a second experiment with independently generated Ba/F3 cells stably transfected with various FLAG-tagged NIPA mutants, DNA was stained with PI. After 24 h of IL-3 withdrawal, up to 75% of the parental Ba/F3 cells underwent apoptosis, in contrast to 36% found in cells expressing wild-type NIPA (Fig. 5B). NIPA-KP and NIPA-S354A demonstrated reduced antiapoptotic function, whereas the NIPA-RKK mutant, whose NLS is completely disabled, showed nearly no effect in preventing apoptosis. Thus, nuclear localization and an intact phosphorylation site Ser-354 seem to be essential for the antiapoptotic function of NIPA in Ba/F3 cells. Although NIPA exhibits remarkable antiapoptotic effects in Ba/F3 cells, it did in fact only delay apoptosis, not enable cells to completely escape apoptosis induced"

We performed down-regulation of REL1 in procyclic T. brucei (midgut insect forms) by RNA interference and found a 40–50% inhibition of Cyb editing, which has only U-insertions, as well as a similar inhibition of ND7 editing, which has both U-insertions and U-deletions. In addition, both U-insertion and U-deletion in vitro pre-cleaved editing were inhibited to similar extents. We also found little if any effect of REL1 down-regulation on the sedimentation coefficient or abundance of the RNA ligase-containing L-complex (Aphasizhev, R., Aphasizheva, I., Nelson, R. E., Gao, G., Simpson, A. M., Kang, X., Falick, A. M., Sbicego, S., and Simpson, L. (2003) EMBO J. 22, 913–924), suggesting that the inhibition of both insertion and deletion editing was not due to a disruption of the L-complex. Together with the evidence that down-regulation of REL2 has no effect on cell growth or on RNA editing in vivo or in vitro, these data suggest that the REL1 RNA ligase may be active in vivo in both U-insertion and U-deletion editing. The in vivo biological role of REL2 remains obscure.

The mechanism in all cases but one involves the annealing of a trans-acting guide RNA to the pre-edited mRNA just downstream of the initial editing site, specific cleavage of the mRNA at the unpaired editing site, deletion of unpaired uridines or addition of uridines to the 3′ end of the 5′ cleavage fragment, which can form base pairs with guiding A or G nucleotides in the guide RNA, and ligation of the 5′ and 3′ cleavage fragments (3Carrillo R.

Conditional disruption of both alleles of the REL1 ligase in bloodstream T. brucei was lethal and affected in vivo RNA editing (12Schnaufer A. Panigrahi A.K. Panicucci B. Igo R.P. Salavati R.

Conditional expression of a mitochondrial targeted REL1 transgene with a K86R mutation at the AMP-binding site in procyclic T. brucei also produced a growth phenotype and disrupted RNA editing (13Huang C.E.

Full round in vitro U-deletion editing using mitochondrial extract from cells expressing the dominant negative REL1 transgene was inhibited ∼50%, whereas U-insertion editing was apparently unaffected (13Huang C.E.

It was also reported that more ATP was required for in vitro U-deletion editing than for U-insertion editing, and that this correlated with the levels of ATP required for adenylation of REL1 and REL2, respectively. In addition, we showed that overexpression of tandem affinity purification-tagged REL1 in Leishmania tarentolae causes the appearance of a minor L-subcomplex containing REL1, LC-3, LC6a, and LC-4, which is the homologue of MP63 in T. brucei (14Aphasizhev R.

The fact that down-regulation of expression of the REL2 RNA ligase by conditional RNAi in procyclic or bloodstream T. brucei showed no phenotype, either in terms of cell growth or editing (16Drozdz M. Palazzo S.S. Salavati R. O'Rear J. Clayton C. Stuart K. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 1791-1799Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), was interpreted as a substitution of the REL2 role by REL1, although the reverse does not occur.In this paper, we have re-analyzed the effects of RNAi down-regulation of REL1 and REL2 in terms of this hypothesis and we conclude that the situation may be more complex than originally envisioned.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESTrypanosome Culture and RNAi—To construct the pREL1-H2H vector for inducible RNAi, two 495-bp PCR fragments from the 5′ end of the T. brucei REL1 coding region were inserted in a head-to-head configuration adjacent to a green fluorescent protein stuffer fragment under the control of a tetracycline-regulatable procyclic acidic repetitive protein promoter (17LaCount D.J.

The recombinant REL1 and REL2 proteins fused with the maltose-binding protein were purified by binding to amylose resin (New England Biolabs) and elution with 10 mm maltose. The recombinant proteins were further purified by SDS-PAGE gel electrophoresis. Polyclonal antibodies against REL1 and REL2 were prepared by Covance Research Products Inc. Monoclonal antibodies against the T. brucei MP81, MP63, and MP42 proteins were kind gifts from Ken Stuart. Western blotting was performed using the Super-Signal West Pico chemiluminescent system (Pierce).RNA Analysis—Total RNA was purified by the acid guanidium isothiocyanate method (20Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (62983) Google Scholar). Primer extension was performed as described previously (21Estévez A.M. Kierszenbaum F. Wirtz E. Bringaud F. Grunstein J. Simpson L. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1999; 100: 5-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Cyb (oligonucleotide 3812) and Murf2 (oligonucleotide 3807) mRNAs were analyzed by run-off extensions. COI (oligonucleotide 3808), COII (oligonucleotide 3809), ND7 (oligonucleotide 4282), A6 (oligonucleotide 3882), and calmodulin (oligonucleotide 3813) mRNAs were analyzed by poisoned primer extension using ddGTP to chain-terminate the extensions at the first C residue after 26 editing sites for A6, the entire editing domain for COII, and 9 editing sites for ND7 (22Aphasizhev R.

For normalization, oligonucleotides 3813 and 3808 for the cytosolic calmodulin mRNA and the never-edited COI mRNA were extended in the same reaction. The following oligonucleotides were used: 3807, 5′-CAACCTGACATTAAAAGAC-3′; 3808, 5′-GTAATGAGTACGTTGTAAAACTG-3′; 3809, 5′-ATTTCATTACACCTACCAGG-3′; 3812, 5′-GTTCTAATACATAACAAATCAAAAACACG-3′; 3813, 5′-GTTGATCGGCCATCGTAAATCAAGTGGATG-3′; 3882, 5′-ATAAACTAGAATAAGATATTGAGG-3′; and 4282, 5′-CTTTTCTGTACCACGATGC-3′.Northern Analysis—Total RNA (30 μg) was fractionated on a 1.5% agarose-formaldehyde gel in 20 mm MOPS, 5 mm sodium acetate, and 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.0, and the gel was blotted onto a Zeta-probe membrane (Bio-Rad). The filter was hybridized with full-length REL1 or REL2 PCR-amplified DNA labeled with [α-32P]ATP using the Prime-It II random primer labeling kit (Stratagene).Extract Preparation, Glycerol Gradient Sedimentation, and Native Gel Electrophoresis—Purified mitochondria (25 mg protein/ml) were lysed with 0.5% Nonidet P-40 in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 10 mm MgCl2, and 60 mm KCl. The clarified extract (300 μl) was centrifuged on a 10–30% glycerol gradient in the SW41 rotor (Beckman) for 20 h at 30,000 rpm, and 150.75-ml fractions were collected from the top using the Isco density gradient fractionator. Aliquots (10 μl) of each fraction were mixed with 0.5 μl (10 μCi/μl) of [α-32P]ATP for 30 min at 27 °C. The reaction was mixed with SDS loading buffer for denaturing gradient gel analysis, and the gels were blotted onto nitrocellulose membranes (Protran) for Western analysis. For both adenylation (23Peris M. Simpson A.M. Grunstein J. Liliental J.E. Frech G.C. Simpson L. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1997; 85: 9-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) and Western blot analysis, an aliquot from fraction 9 of an identical gradient of mitochondrial extract from untransfected 29–13 cells was used as an internal loading control in each gel. Sedimentation values were calculated using aldolase (9 S), thyroglobulin (19 S) and E. coli ribosome 30 S subunits.RNA Substrates and in Vitro Editing—The following RNA substrates were chemically synthesized (Oligos Etc. and Xeragon) and gel-purified: 5′ fragment, 5′-GCACUACACGAUAAAUAUAAAAAG-3′; 5′-UU fragment, 5′-GCACUACACGAUAAAUAUAAAAAGUU-3′; 3′ fragment, 5′-AACAUUAUGCUUCUUCGddC-3′; AG brRNA, 5′-AAGAAGCAUAAUGUUAGCUUUUUAUAUUUAUCGUGUAGUCddG-3′; and 0 brRNA, 5′-AAGAAGCAUAAUGUUCUUUUUAUAUUUAUCGUGUAGUCddG-3′.RNAs were 5′-phosphorylated with T4 polynucleotide kinase (Invitrogen) and [γ-32P]ATP. Complementary RNAs were annealed by heating and slow-cooling. For in vitro editing assays, the L-complex fractions (8Cruz-Reyes J. Sollner-Webb B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The concentrated gradient fractions were stored at –20 °C in 50% glycerol, 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 1 mm dithiothreitol. The fractions were fractionated by electrophoresis on 8–16% denaturing gradient gels, and the gels were stained with Coomassie Blue (Sigma) to monitor the protein concentrations. The in vitro editing reactions were performed at 27 °C for 2 h in 20 μl of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 1 mm ATP. 2 mm UTP was added for the insertion reaction. The products were separated in a sequencing gel and detected by autoradiography.RESULTSDown-regulation of REL1 Ligase Expression Inhibits Both U-insertion and U-deletion Editing in Vivo—Down-regulation of REL1 by conditional RNAi produced a growth inhibition by day 6 of induction (Fig. 1A), which was preceded by a selective degradation of REL1 mRNA and down-regulation of REL1 protein expression by day 3 (Fig. 1B). A correlated down-regulation of the MP63 L-complex protein was also observed (Fig. 1C). The relative abundances of edited and pre-edited mRNAs were examined for five genes by primer extension analysis (Fig. 2). Editing of Cyb and ND7 mRNAs decreased 40–70% after 7 days of RNAi induction, and editing of COII, MURF2, and A6 mRNAs decreased slightly. There was no change in the abundance of pre-edited RNAs or the never-edited COI mRNA, suggesting a specific effect on editing.Fig. 2Effect of REL1 and REL2 RNAi on RNA editing in vivo.

U-insertion editing and U-deletion editing were inhibited to similar extents. There was no effect on the addition or deletion of 3′-terminal uridines to or from the 5′-mRNA cleavage fragment. In the case of REL2 RNAi, there were no detectable changes in the extent of U-insertion or U-deletion pre-cleaved in vitro editing (Fig. 3).Fig. 3Effect of REL1 RNAi and REL2 RNAi on pre-cleaved in vitro editing. Both +2U-guided U-insertion and –2U-guided U-deletion editing were assayed. Mitochondrial extract was isolated from untransfected 29–13 cells and from transfected cells 0, 3, and 5 days after the addition of tetracycline. The extracts were fractionated in glycerol gradients and fractions 8–10 (of 15 total fractions) containing the peak of the L-complex and were pooled and concentrated. The concentrated fractions were used for in vitro editing assays. Input lane, no enzyme.

In fact, it was previously reported that knocking out of one REL1 allele in T. brucei procyclics produced a partial breakdown of the L-complex (13Huang C.E. Cruz-Reyes J. Zhelonkina A.G. O'Hearn S. Wirtz E. Sollner-Webb B. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 4694-4703Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). To test this possibility, mitochondrial extract from cells induced for REL1 RNAi for 0, 3, or 5 days was fractionated in a glycerol gradient and each fraction was incubated with [α-32P]ATP to label the REL1 and REL2 RNA ligases, which represent markers for the L-complex. It should be noted that the REL1 ligase was labeled to a greater extent than the REL2 ligase because of the latter being pre-charged with AMP (11Rusché L.N. Huang C.E. Piller K.J. Hemann M. Wirtz E. Sollner-Webb B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 979-989Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). The S value of the L-complex did not change as the REL1 protein decreased in abundance (Fig. 4A). Western analysis of each fraction using antibodies against MP81, MP63, and REL1 was also performed (Fig. 4A). Despite the loss of detectable REL1 protein, the L-complex was unaffected in terms of location in the gradient and relative abundance. Down-regulation of REL2 likewise had no effect on the S value or relative abundance of the L-complex (Fig. 4B).Fig. 4Effect of REL1 RNAi and REL2 RNAi on S value and relative abundance of L-complex.

See A for details.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)DISCUSSIONThe presence of two mitochondrial RNA ligases, both of which are components of the L-complex, has raised an interesting question. Several lines of evidence have led to the model that REL1 is involved in U-deletion editing and REL2 is involved in U-insertion editing (13Huang C.E. Cruz-Reyes J. Zhelonkina A.G. O'Hearn S. Wirtz E. Sollner-Webb B. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 4694-4703Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 15Cruz-Reyes J. Zhelonkina A.G. Huang C.E. Sollner-Webb B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 4652-4660Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 24Cruz-Reyes J. Rusche L. Piller K.J. Sollner-Webb B. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 401-409Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The complete absence of any phenotype with REL2 down-regulation has been explained by the suggestion that REL1 can substitute for REL2 in the REL2 down-regulated cells and mediate both types of editing (13Huang C.E. Cruz-Reyes J. Zhelonkina A.G. O'Hearn S. Wirtz E. Sollner-Webb B. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 4694-4703Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 15Cruz-Reyes J. Zhelonkina A.G. Huang C.E. Sollner-Webb B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 4652-4660Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The lethality of the REL1 knock-out has been explained by assuming that REL2 is not capable of substituting for REL1 in U-deletion editing.The results presented in this paper raise some doubts about this model. We showed that down-regulation of REL1 expression affected the in vivo editing of different mRNAs to different extents, but the inhibitory effect was apparently correlated with the percentage of editing of the specific mRNA rather than with the presence of U-insertions alone or U-insertions and U-deletions. For example, the editing of Cyb mRNA, which only involves U-insertions, was inhibited to a similar extent as the editing of ND7 mRNA, which involves both U-insertions and U-deletions. The editing of A6, MURF2, and COII mRNAs, the former two involving both insertions and deletions and the latter involving only insertions, was inhibited to a lesser extent, both decreasing ∼20% by day 7. The magnitude of the effect on editing appeared to be inversely correlated with the normal extent of editing, in that A6, MURF2, and COII editing is normally very efficient (>90% edited RNA), whereas Cyb and ND7 editing is less efficient (∼70% edited RNA). The reason for this variation in the extent of inhibition of editing with different mRNAs is not known. Furthermore, we showed that pre-cleaved U-insertion and U-deletion in vitro editing were inhibited to similar extents. These results differ from those reported previously both in terms of the effect on Cyb mRNA editing in vivo and full-round in vitro editing (13Huang C.E. Cruz-Reyes J. Zhelonkina A.G. O'Hearn S. Wirtz E. Sollner-Webb B. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 4694-4703Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), the reasons for which are not clear but may be related to the different modes of gene knockdown and to the different in vitro assays. We eliminated the possibility that RNAi down-regulation of REL1 affected the overall stability of the L-complex and thereby also affected U-insertion editing by showing that there was no large change in S value or abundance of the L-complex in the REL1 RNAi-induced cells. We conclude that the simplest interpretation is that REL1 performs ligations for both U-insertion and U-deletion editing and that REL2 is less active or even inactive in vivo, at least under these physiological conditions. We realize that the simplest interpretation is not always valid and that, for example, down-regulation of REL1 may affect the functional interaction of REL2 with other L-complex proteins and thereby also affect U-insertion editing, but this would have to be established. It is clear from both the apparently functional suborganization of proteins in the L-complex (14Aphasizhev R. Aphasizheva I. Nelson R.E. Gao G. Simpson A.M. Kang X. Falick A.M. Sbicego S. Simpson L. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 913-924Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar) and from the striking ATP titration correlations (15Cruz-Reyes J. Zhelonkina A.G. Huang C.E. Sollner-Webb B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 4652-4660Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) that REL1 and REL2 probably have differing biological roles, but the precise nature of these roles is yet unclear. We speculate that REL2 may be active under different physiological or developmental conditions. The precise roles of these two RNA ligases await reconstitution of activities with recombinant proteins.

The mechanism in all cases but one involves the annealing of a trans-acting guide RNA to the pre-edited mRNA just downstream of the initial editing site, specific cleavage of the mRNA at the unpaired editing site, deletion of unpaired uridines or addition of uridines to the 3′ end of the 5′ cleavage fragment, which can form base pairs with guiding A or G nucleotides in the guide RNA, and ligation of the 5′ and 3′ cleavage fragments (3Carrillo R.

For these reasons, Lytle et al. (6Lytle J.R. Wu L. Robertson H.D. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 7629-7636Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) considered several elements of higher order structure that could be responsible for IRES function. So far, however, no structural element with a known affinity for ribosomes has been shown to be a common feature within the ribosome recognition domains of more than one IRES element. Probes of HCV IRES RNA higher order structure include the prediction of an RNA pseudo-knot involving sequences in stem-loop III (2Jackson R.J. Sonnenberg N. Hershey J. Mathews M.B.

Surprisingly, one group of studies has also shown that human RNase P will recognize and cleave the HCV RNA genome in two places, one of which is in the IRES very close to the initiator AUG start triplet (14Nadal A.

RNase P is an abundant cellular endoribonuclease that is responsible for processing tRNA precursors to produce mature 5′ termini (16Robertson H.D. Altman S. Smith J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1972; 247: 5243-5251Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Altman S. Adv. Enzymol. Relat. Areas Mol. Biol. 1989; 62: 1-36PubMed Google Scholar, 18Jarrous N. Altman S.

It is well known that RNase P works via structural, not sequence-dependent, recognition of tRNA domains (16Robertson H.D. Altman S. Smith J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1972; 247: 5243-5251Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Altman S. Adv. Enzymol. Relat. Areas Mol. Biol. 1989; 62: 1-36PubMed Google Scholar). In fact, the presence of an RNase P-cleavable site is one accepted test for the presence of tRNA-like structure (16Robertson H.D. Altman S. Smith J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1972; 247: 5243-5251Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Komine Y. Kitabatake M. Yokogawa T. Nishikawa K. Proc. Natl. Acad.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1982; 10: 1947-1962Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) and has been used, along with other tests, to identify tRNA mimicry in various RNA species (20Komine Y. Kitabatake M. Yokogawa T. Nishikawa K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 1994; 91: 9223-9277Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar, 21Joshi S. Chapeville F. Haenni A.L.

Science. 1982; 217: 1147-1149Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Because the susceptibility to cleavage by RNase P is a strong indicator of tRNA-like structure, this property of the HCV IRES has caused us to suggest the existence of tRNA-like structure in or near stem-loop III (6Lytle J.R. Wu L. Robertson H.D. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 7629-7636Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 20Komine Y. Kitabatake M. Yokogawa T. Nishikawa K. Proc. Natl. Acad.

We have conducted the studies reported here to test whether such tRNA mimicry is unique to HCV or whether it might be a general property of IRES structure. In particular, we have compared the RNase P sensitivity of the HCV IRES with that of the IRES domains in two pestiviral RNA genomes related in structure and function to HCV, the classical swine fever virus (CSFV) and the bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV). Our findings show that tRNA-like structure occurs near the AUG start triplet in these three IRES domains. To generalize these findings further, we have also tested for RNase P cleavage in the IRESs of encephalomyocarditis virus, a picornavirus, and in the cricket paralysis virus, an insect virus. Both undergo RNase P cleavage at specific sites. These results strongly suggest that tRNA-like domains may be a general structural feature of IRESs, the first such IRES structure to be identified with a functional correlate. In fact, tRNA-like features could easily be recognized by ribosomal sites as a standard part of all IRES-directed protein synthesis initiation. Preparation of RNA Transcripts—HCV IRES RNAs were transcribed from Bluescript plasmid pN(1–4728), which contains nucleotides 1–4728 of hepatitis C virus under the T7 promoter (a gift from Dr. Stanley Lemon, University of Texas, Galveston). This DNA template was cleaved by the SacII restriction enzyme. When transcribed in vitro, a 32P-labeled RNA spanning bases 1–641 is produced. RNA transcripts of CSFV are from a pGEMII plasmid with an insert containing the CSFV IRES fused to influenza protein NS1, (a gift from Dr. R. J. Jackson, Cambridge University). This plasmid, when linearized with the NcoI restriction enzyme, serves as template for a 32P-labeled RNA containing bases 1–450 of the CSFV genome. BVDV RNA was obtained from transcription of pACNR plasmid BVDV NADL 5′Δ 2702, containing the BVDV RNA sequence with a deletion of nucleotides 3094–12147 (a gift from Dr. C. Rice, Rockefeller University, New York). Linearization with SacI yields a DNA that serves as template for a transcript spanning bases 1–695 of the BVDV genome upon transcription. EMCV IRES RNAs were transcribed from a pGEM plasmid with the EMCV IRES sequence fused to that encoding the N-terminal viral polyprotein of the virus. Restriction with Bst4C1 yields the template for RNA spanning bases 262–834 of the EMCV IRES. This plasmid was a generous gift of Dr. A. Kaminski, University of Cambridge. RNA transcripts of cricket paralysis virus (CrPV) were made from the pEJ4 construct, a kind gift from Dr. E. Jan, Stanford University. This plasmid, when linearized with the NcoI restriction enzyme, encodes an RNA containing bases 1–220 of the CrPV IGR IRES. All transcription reactions were based on earlier published work from this laboratory (6Lytle J.R. Wu L. Robertson H.D. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 7629-7636Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 10Lytle J.R. Wu L. Robertson H.D. RNA. 2002; 8: 1045-1055Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 11Lyons A.J. Lytle J.R. Gomez J. Robertson H.D. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 2535-2541Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). [α-32P]GTP (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) was used in all labeled transcriptions unless noted otherwise. Transcripts were purified by gel electrophoresis under denaturing conditions on 5% polyacrylamide gels with 7 m urea as described previously (11Lyons A.J. Lytle J.R. Gomez J. Robertson H.D. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 2535-2541Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 15Nadal A. Martell M. Lytle J.R. Lyons A.J. Robertson H.D. Cabot B. Esteban J.I. Esteban R. Guardia J. Gomez J. J.

Bands were visualized by autoradiography, excised from the gel, and eluted in buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.5). RNase P Cleavage—All substrates for RNase P cleavage, derived from transcription reactions described above, were preheated at 90 °C for 1 min, added to reaction buffer (10 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgOAc, 100 mm NH4OAc), and left to cool to room temperature. Cleavage reactions were performed with 4% polyethylene glycol, 20 units of RNasin and RNase P and carried out at 30 °C in a volume of 10 μl for 1 h. The final concentration of the substrates in these reactions was 1.8 nm. Human RNase P (glycerol gradient fraction, the kind gift of Dr. S. Altman) was used with an excess of enzyme units over substrate (18Jarrous N. Altman S. Methods Enzymol. 2001; 342: 93-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). At the end of the reactions, samples were subjected to treatment with SDS and proteinase K at 50 °C as described previously (22Branch A.D. Robertson H.D. Greer C. Gegenheimer P. Peebles C. Abelson J. Science. 1982; 217: 1147-1149Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), and cleavage products were then separated on 4% denaturing polyacrylamide gels and visualized by autoradiography as described (15Nadal A. Martell M. Lytle J.R. Lyons A.J. Robertson H.D. Cabot B. Esteban J.I. Esteban R. Guardia J. Gomez J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 30606-30613Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). For kinetic studies, samples were treated as above and incubated in scaled-up 30-μl reaction volumes prepared as above. Aliquots of 5 μl were withdrawn at 0, 30, 60, 90, and 120 min, subjected to SDS-proteinase K treatment, and analyzed on polyacrylamide gels as described above. Starting material and product bands were quantified as follows using an Amersham Biosciences Storm PhosphorImager: percent RNase P cleavage = (products)/(starting material + products). RNA Fingerprinting—RNA fingerprinting, a technique in which RNA molecules are digested to completion with RNase T1 (Calbiochem) and the digestion products are separated in two dimensions by charge and size, has been described previously (23Branch A.D. Benenfeld B.J. Robertson H.D. Methods Enzymol. 1989; 180: 130-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 24Barrell B.G. Cantoni G.L. Davies D.R. Procedures in Nucleic Acid Research. Harper and Row, New York1971: 751-779Google Scholar). Determination of Cleavage Sites—To carry out precise characterization and mapping, it is necessary to use direct sequencing techniques involving internally labeled RNA molecules when the normal internal sequence pattern of an RNA is interrupted. Examples of such events include mapping of RNA splice junctions and lariats; UV-induced covalent RNA-RNA cross-links; RNA editing to produce noncanonical bases, such as inosine; tRNA modification of pre-existing bases; and cleavage by enzymes (such as the RNase P used here) that produce 5′ phosphate and 3′-hydroxyl termini rather than the usual 5′-hydroxyl and 3′-phosphate ends. Thus, direct methods were employed here rather than indirect approaches such as DNA primer extension with reverse transcriptase or partial digestion of end-labeled transcripts. Oligonucleotides derived from RNase T1 digestions were fractionated to yield two-dimensional fingerprints, from which individual oligonucleotides were located by autoradiography and eluted by standard techniques (24Barrell B.G. Cantoni G.L. Davies D.R. Procedures in Nucleic Acid Research. Harper and Row, New York1971: 751-779Google Scholar). Standard conditions for secondary analysis of the T1 digestion products (with pancreatic RNase A, RNase U2, RNase T2 or 0.4 m NaOH, followed by high voltage electrophoresis on Whatman DE81 or 3MM papers (23Branch A.D. Benenfeld B.J. Robertson H.D. Methods Enzymol. 1989; 180: 130-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar)) were used, permitting the oligonucleotides to be identified. Digestion by calf alkaline phosphatase (Promega) was used to identify oligonucleotides containing 5′ terminal phosphate residues produced by RNase P cleavage. RNase P Cleavage of Pestiviral Transcripts—The 5′ terminal region of the genomic RNA for each of the HCV-type viral RNAs was transcribed as described under “Experimental Procedures,” purified, and digested with RNase P. These reactions yield the results shown in Fig. 1, a 5% sequencing gel electrophoretic profile of HCV (HC), CSFV (CS), and BVDV (BV) IRES substrates without (–) or with (+) treatment by highly purified human RNase P. An early time point in the RNase P cleavage kinetics for HCV was chosen for all substrates to highlight the primary cleavage event. As shown in Fig. 1, the three HCV-type IRES RNAs are cleaved, CSFV more efficiently than HCV and BVDV less so. Principal cleavage products are indicated by numerals to the right of the lanes showing RNase P-treated RNAs. Fig. 2 depicts kinetics of RNase P cleavage of the HCV IRES transcript, showing >50% cleavage over a 90-min time course.Fig. 2Kinetics of HCV IRES cleavage by RNase P.

Enumerated bands were eluted for further analysis. To map the exact location of the HCV and CSFV cleavages, transcripts were digested with RNase P under conditions outlined above and then fractionated on polyacrylamide denaturing gels. Both control transcripts and all digestion products labeled in Fig. 1 were then eluted from the gels, digested with RNase T1, and subjected to two-dimensional RNA fingerprinting analysis (23Branch A.D. Benenfeld B.J. Robertson H.D. Methods Enzymol. 1989; 180: 130-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Direct characterization of the internally labeled RNA fragments produced by RNase P cleavage in the HCV IRES (Fig. 1) showed that cleavage occurs just beyond the AUG initiator, centering on bases 361–362 (data not shown) as found previously (15Nadal A. Martell M. Lytle J.R. Lyons A.J. Robertson H.D. Cabot B. Esteban J.I. Esteban R. Guardia J. Gomez J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 30606-30613Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Fig. 3 shows RNA fingerprinting analysis of CSFV IRES RNase P cleavage products. RNAs eluted from the gel depicted in Fig. 1, center panel, were subjected to exhaustive RNase T1 digestion and two-dimensional RNA fingerprinting. Panel A shows a control fingerprint of the entire 450-base CSFV IRES transcript, whereas Panels B–D show fingerprints of the three RNase P digestion products, CSFV bands 1, 2, and 3, respectively (Fig. 1). Spots numbered 1–7 (Fig. 3) are RNase T1-resistant fragments, characterized by direct methods (23Branch A.D. Benenfeld B.J. Robertson H.D. Methods Enzymol. 1989; 180: 130-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 24Barrell B.G. Cantoni G.L. Davies D.R. Procedures in Nucleic Acid Research. Harper and Row, New York1971: 751-779Google Scholar), that are present in the control sequence, absent in band 1, and present in bands 2 and 3 (Table I). It is noteworthy that spot 4, 370CACAUG375, contains the CSFV IRES AUG initiator triplet.Table IRNase T1-resistant oligonucleotides in the 3′-proximal CSFV IRES domainSpotSequence and position1392AAUUAUUAUACAAAACAAG4102411CAAACAAAAACCAG4243382AAUCAUUUUG3914370CACAUG3755437AACCG4416444UACCAUGoh4507379UUG381X364pACAUG368aFig. 3C. or 371pACAUG375bFig. 3D.a Fig. 3C.b Fig. 3D. Open table in a new tab CSFV band 1 (Fig. 3B) contains all T1-resistant RNA oligonucleotides from the control CSFV transcript sequence up to base 359, including the 5′ end of CSFV (see legend to Fig. 3). This suggests that cleavage takes place downstream of that position in the IRES sequence. Bands 2 and 3 (Fig. 3, C and D) were found to contain all T1-resistant fragments between bases 370 and 450. Notably, the unique T1-resistant oligonucleotide 363UACAUG368 was missing or significantly reduced in the fingerprint patterns of all of the CSFV RNase P digestion products. Furthermore, bands 2 and 3 (Fig. 3, C and D) were found to contain a novel oligonucleotide, designated spot “X.” Upon further secondary analyses, including alkaline phosphatase treatment, spot X was found to have the sequence 5′-pACAUG-3′. RNase P cleavage is well known to yield 5′-phosphate and 3′-hydroxyl termini (16Robertson H.D. Altman S. Smith J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1972; 247: 5243-5251Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Altman S. Adv. Enzymol. Relat. Areas Mol. Biol. 1989; 62: 1-36PubMed Google Scholar, 18Jarrous N. Altman S. Methods Enzymol. 2001; 342: 93-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar); thus it is likely that spot X represents the new 5′-ends created by RNase P. With respect to band 2, the presence of spot 4 along with spot X suggests that cleavage must have occurred within the “missing” oligonucleotide, 363UACAUG368, precisely between bases 363U and 364A, yielding the T1-resistant oligonucleotide X (364pACAUG368). This cleavage event is shown schematically in Fig. 4 (circled “P” on left). With respect to band 3 (Fig. 3D), it was found to contain the same T1-resistant fragments as band 2 (Fig. 3C), with the notable exception of spot 4, which is missing from band 3. As shown in Fig. 4, we conclude that CSFV band 3 is the product of a second RNase P cleavage, which occurs near the first one, this time between bases 370C and 371A (see Fig. 4, circled letter P on right). This second cleavage would also produce a T1-resistant oligonucleotide with the sequence pACAUG (spot X in Table I). However, in band 3 (Fig. 3D) we conclude that the sequence identity of the spot labeled X is 371pACAUG375. Thus it appears that RNase P makes two cuts, the second seven bases away from the first, at sites near the CSFV IRES initiator AUG triplet that have a very close sequence homology to each other (G(U/C)ACAUGG in each case). This series of events also explains why the fingerprint of CSFV band 1 (Fig. 3B) contains reduced levels of the oligonucleotide 363UACAUG368; the band is actually an unresolved mixture of two sequences, CSFV bases 1–363 and 1–370. RNase P Cleavage of the BVDV IRES—RNA fingerprinting analysis was carried out on control and RNase P-treated BVDV IRES-containing RNAs transcribed from SacI-treated DNA templates (Fig. 1). Comparison of the resulting patterns and knowledge of the identity of the control T1-resistant fragments (data not shown) allowed us to conclude that all of the T1-resistant oligonucleotides included in this assay (7 bases or longer) from the 5′-end of the BVDV IRES up to base 372 (a total of 8 fragments) were present in BVDV product 1 (Fig. 1, right lane, BV). BVDV product 2 (Fig. 1) was not recovered in sufficient quantities to be included in this T1 mapping survey. Nonetheless, although the BVDV IRES region spanning bases 373–394 (which includes the AUG initiation codon at 386–388) does not contain any RNase T1-resistant fragments of 7 bases or longer, the T1-resistant fragment spanning bases 395–404 was absent from the BVDV product 1 fingerprint pattern, as were all other such T1-resistant oligonucleotides through the 3′-end of the BVDV SacI transcript at base 695 (a total of 11 fragments). We therefore conclude that the primary RNase P cleavage site within the BVDV IRES maps between bases 373 and 394. Because of the similarity of the BVDV and CSFV IRES sequences in this region (see below), we predict that the BVDV IRES RNase P cleavage sites will closely resemble those in CSFV. IRES RNase P Cleavage Map Positions— Fig. 5 summarizes RNase P cleavage locations for all three viral IRES-containing transcripts as identified by RNA fingerprinting and secondary analysis or oligonucleotide survey techniques. The HCV IRES RNase P cleavage site, shown as a circled letter P in Fig. 5, maps at bases 361–362 (15Nadal A. Martell M. Lytle J.R. Lyons A.J. Robertson H.D. Cabot B. Esteban J.I. Esteban R. Guardia J. Gomez J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 30606-30613Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The CSFV RNase P cleavage sites map at positions 363–364 and 370–371 whereas BVDV RNase P cleavage occurs between bases 373–394, part of an extensive region of identity between the CSFV and BVDV IRESs (see below). The possible occurrence of a dual cleavage event in the BVDV IRES is indicated. It is clear that, in all three of these viral IRES RNAs, RNase P cleavages map very closely to the initiator AUG, suggesting the presence of a tRNA-like structural element nearby. Exploratory RNase P Treatment of Other Viral IRES RNAs—To test whether tRNA-like regions recognizable by RNase P could be a general feature of IRES RNAs, we tested IRES transcripts from two unrelated viruses. As shown in Fig. 6, RNase P both recognizes and cleaves RNA transcripts of the CrPV IRES. It is evident from the widely differing sizes of the two RNase P cleavage products in Fig. 6, lane 3, that cleavage occurs near one end of this IRES sequence. Furthermore, in similar tests, specific RNase P cleavage of transcripts from the EMCV IRES, similar to that for CrPV shown in Fig. 6, was also obtained (data not shown). In this paper we have demonstrated that there are similarly placed recognition elements for the human pre-tRNA processing enzyme, RNase P, in several viral IRES domains including HCV, CSFV, BVDV, CrPV, and EMCV. In the cases of HCV, CSFV, and BVDV, the RNase P-sensitive elements map in close proximity to the AUG initiator triplet. As first pointed out by Nadal et al. (15Nadal A. Martell M. Lytle J.R.

In Trypanosoma brucei, mRNA processing is of particular importance, since most transcripts are derived from polycistronic transcription units. This organization dictates that regulated gene expression is promoter-independent and governed at the posttranscriptional level. We have identified tbCPSF30, a protein containing five CCCH zinc finger motifs, which is a homologue of the cleavage and polyadenylation specificity factor (CPSF) 30-kDa subunit, a component of the machinery required for 3′-end formation in yeast and mammals. Using gene silencing of tbCPSF30 by RNA interference, we demonstrate that this gene is essential in bloodstream and procyclic forms of T. brucei. Interestingly, tbCPSF30-specific RNA interference results in the accumulation of an aberrant tbCPSF30 mRNA species concomitant with depletion of tbCPSF30 protein. tbCPSF30 protein depletion is accompanied by the accumulation of unprocessed tubulin RNAs, implicating tbCPSF30 in polycistronic RNA processing. By genome data base mining, we also identify several other putative components of the T. brucei cleavage and polyadenylation machinery, indicating their conservation throughout eukaryotic evolution.

The African trypanosome (Trypanosoma brucei) is the causative agent of sleeping sickness in humans and nagana in cattle. Trypanosomes are evolutionarily ancient organisms in which numerous unusual aspects of eukaryotic biology have been discovered, for example the possession of glycosomes, extensive antigenic variation mediated by genome recombination, and the RNA editing of mitochondrial transcripts. Also, the trypanosomatid family of protozoan parasites does not use the normal eukaryotic arrangement for gene expression (for a review, see Ref. 1Clayton C.E. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 1881-1888Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar). Instead, genes are organized into polycistronic transcription units, whereby many genes may be transcribed by an upstream promoter. Precursor RNAs are then processed into mRNA by the addition of a 39-nucleotide capped RNA (spliced leader) through a trans-splicing event (2Murphy W.J. Watkins K.P. Agabian N. Cell. 1986; 47: 517-525Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar, 3Sutton R.E. Boothroyd J.C. Cell. 1986; 47: 527-535Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar) and by cleavage and polyadenylation. A consequence of this arrangement is that the regulation of genes within such transcription units is not governed by promoter activity but by mRNA processing and stability. These organisms, therefore, represent a regulatory extreme in which the genome is almost exclusively controlled post-transcriptionally. In consequence, T. brucei is an interesting model for the study of the regulation of gene expression at the RNA level.Analyses of RNA processing in trypansomatids have largely focused on trans-splicing. Trans-splicing has been shown to be mechanistically similar to cis-splicing of introns in yeast and higher eukaryotes, and the basic components of both processes are conserved (for a review, see Ref. 4Agabian N. Cell. 1990; 61: 1157-1160Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). In contrast, little is known about the process of trypanosome mRNA 3′-end formation, and no recognizable conserved motifs, such as the AAUAAA sequence of higher eukaryotes, are present upstream of trypanosome polyadenylation sites. Evidence also suggests that maturation of T. brucei polycistronic pre-mRNAs involves a temporal and mechanistic relationship between trans-splicing and 3′-end formation. It has been shown that the pyrimidine-rich sequences immediately upstream of the α-tubulin trans-splice site are a major determinant for β-tubulin mRNA 3′-end formation (5Matthews K.R. Tschudi C. Ullu E. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 491-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). Therefore, the sequence signals important for trans-splicing of the downstream gene are believed to contribute to 3′-end formation of the upstream gene in a polycistron. This is consistent with the possibility that the polypyrimidine tract is recognized by both the trans-splicing and polyadenylation machineries, either sequentially or simultaneously (6LeBowitz J.H. Smith H.Q. Rusche L. Beverley S.M. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 996-1007Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). The nematode Caenorhabditis elegans also undergoes trans-splicing during mRNA maturation, and, as in trypanosomes, this organism is believed to couple trans-splicing and polyadenylation to process precursor RNAs. Although several studies have concentrated on the identification of the components of the trans-splicing machinery in both T. brucei and C. elegans (7Palfi Z. Gunzl A. Cross M. Bindereif A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 9097-9101Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 8Thomas J. Lea K. Zucker-Aprison E. Blumenthal T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 2633-2642Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), there have been no studies in either of these organisms concerning the cleavage and polyadenylation machinery to date. Thus, the mechanistic links between the trans-splicing machinery and 3′-end formation in polycistronic RNA processing have only been the result of investigating polyadenylation as a consequence of perturbations in the signals/machinery for trans-splicing (5Matthews K.R. Tschudi C. Ullu E. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 491-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar, 6LeBowitz J.H. Smith H.Q. Rusche L. Beverley S.M. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 996-1007Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar, 9Kuersten S. Lea K. MacMorris M. Spieth J. Blumenthal T. RNA. 1997; 3: 269-278PubMed Google Scholar).A major goal of investigating the mechanisms of pre-mRNA 3′-end processing is the identification and functional characterization of the different trans-acting factors involved in the reaction. In a previous study, we identified a family of proteins in T. brucei, possessing a CCCH zinc finger motif (10Hendriks E.F. Robinson D.R. Hinkins M. Matthews K.R. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 6700-6711Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), characteristic of RNA-binding proteins. In this study, we have used genome data base mining to identify a protein containing five CCCH fingers and show it to be the cleavage and polyadenylation specificity factor 30-kDa subunit of T. brucei (tbCPSF30). Here, we specifically perturb tbCPSF30 by RNA interference and show that tbCPSF30 is essential for T. brucei survival in both the mammalian bloodstream and insect procyclic forms of the parasite. Interestingly, unprocessed tubulin transcripts accumulate when tbCPSF30 is depleted by RNA interference (RNAi), 1The abbreviations used are: RNAi, RNA interference; PAP, poly(A)-polymerase.1The abbreviations used are: RNAi, RNA interference; PAP, poly(A)-polymerase. as has been seen previously when trans-splicing is disrupted. This implies that the integrity of the polyadenylation machinery as well as the trans-splicing machinery is required for polycistronic RNA processing. The significant sequence conservation of yeast, worm, fly, zebrafish, mammalian, and now T. brucei CPSF30 homologues, suggests that all of these are members of a family of proteins conserved from the earliest eukaryotes to vertebrates. Moreover, identification of other core component homologues of the yeast and mammalian CPSF in the T. brucei CPSF complex, by data base mining, suggests a basic conservation of the CPSF complex among eukaryotes with diverse mechanisms for regulating gene expression.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESTrypanosome Cultures and Transfection—Monomorphic bloodstream form T. brucei rhodesiense EATRO 2340 were cultured in HMI-9 at 37 °C, 5% CO2. Procyclic form T. brucei 427 cells were cultured in SDM-79 at 27 °C. For RNAi analysis, cultured T. brucei 427 “single marker T7 RNAP/TETR” bloodstream form cells (11Wirtz E. Leal S. Ochatt C. Cross G.A. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1999; 99: 89-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (1104) Google Scholar) (SMB) were used. These cells have been engineered to express the T7 polymerase and a tetracycline repressor. RNAi analysis in procyclic forms was carried out in T. brucei 427 29-13 cells, which have also been engineered to express the T7 polymerase and the tetracycline repressor protein (11Wirtz E. Leal S. Ochatt C. Cross G.A. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1999; 99: 89-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (1104) Google Scholar).Transfection of both bloodstream and procyclic form parasites was carried out as described in Ref. 10Hendriks E.F. Robinson D.R. Hinkins M. Matthews K.R. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 6700-6711Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar using 10 μg of NotI (pHD451) or EcoRV (p2T7i) linearized DNA electroporated into 500 μl of cells at 4 × 107 cells ml–1. Transfected cells were recovered overnight in 10 ml of HMI-9 at 37 °C, 5% CO2 (bloodstream forms), or SDM-79 medium at 27 °C (procyclic forms) before being diluted to 1 × 105 cells ml–1 and subjected to drug selection in 24-well plates. Drug concentrations used for selection were hygromycin (2 μg ml–1 for bloodstream forms, 20–50 μg ml–1 for procyclic forms), G418 (2.5 μg ml–1 for bloodstream forms, 15 μg ml–1 for procyclic forms), or phleomycin (0.5–2.5 μg ml–1 for bloodstream forms, 5 μg ml–1 for procyclic forms). Selected cells were cloned by limiting dilution under drug selection.Transgenic Plasmid Constructs—The trypanosome expression vector pHD451 (12Biebinger S. Wirtz L.E. Lorenz P. Clayton C. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1997; 85: 99-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar) was modified to contain the TY1 epitope tag fused to the C terminus of genes cloned into the HindIII and BamHI sites. This vector was designated pHD451-TY1. The tbCPSF30 coding region was amplified by PCR using primers CPSF30.F and CPSF30.R (CPSF30.F is CC AAG CTT ATG TTT ACT GAC AAC GCT GCC C; CPSF30.R is GGG ATC CCT GCC TTC CCG TTG CAT CAC) and cloned into HindIII/BamHI-digested pHD451-TY1. This plasmid was then used to direct tbCPSF30 transgene expression in either bloodstream or procyclic form parasites that had been previously engineered to express the tetracycline repressor by stable transfection with the expression construct pHD449 (12Biebinger S. Wirtz L.E. Lorenz P. Clayton C. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1997; 85: 99-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar).The tbCPSF30 RNAi construct was made using the vector p2T7i (13LaCount D.J. Barrett B. Donelson J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 17580-17588Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar), which allows for tetracycline-inducible expression of double-stranded RNA from a T7 promoter in T. brucei 427 SMB or 427 29-13 procyclic cells. The tbCPSF30 coding region was amplified using PCR primers CPSF30.F and CPSF30.R and cloned into the HindIII and BamHI sites of p2T7i. Further details of all constructs used in this paper are available upon request.Total RNA Isolation, cDNA Synthesis, and Northern Analysis— Trypanosome RNA was prepared using a Qiagen RNA-easy kit (by the manufacturer's method), and Northern blotting was performed as described previously (14Tasker M. Wilson J. Sarkar M. Hendriks E. Matthews K. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 1905-1917Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Blots were hybridized at 60 °C with riboprobes labeled with digoxygenin (Roche Applied Science), and stringency washes were at 60 °C, 0.1× SSC. Blot detection was by chemiluminescence using CDP-star as a reaction substrate. The α/β tubulin intergenic region riboprobe was generated from a construct previously engineered in pBluescript II (5Matthews K.R. Tschudi C. Ullu E. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 491-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar).Anti-peptide Antibody Production, Protein Isolation, and Western Blotting—An anti-peptide antibody to T. brucei CPSF30 was generated using two peptide antigens comprising the sequences LIERADDPSFNKNATC and QQWGGHRRGDATGRQ (see Fig. 1A). Both were coupled to keyhole limpet hemocyanin and used to immunize rabbits (Eurogentec, Belgium), the resulting serum being affinity-purified against each of the peptide antigens. Preimmune serum and immune serum were screened against whole cell trypanosome proteins. Preimmune serum did not show any reaction with T. brucei proteins.Proteins were prepared as described in Ref. 15Tasker M. Timms M. Hendriks E. Matthews K. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 39: 272-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar and resolved on 11% polyacrylamide gels. Blotted proteins were incubated with either the anti-TY1 epitope tag monoclonal antibody (BB2; diluted 1:20) or with the affinity-purified rabbit anti-tbCPSF30 antibody (diluted 1:20). Western blots were processed using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody and visualized by chemiluminescence (Amersham Biosciences).Cell Growth, Microscopy, and Computational Analysis—tbCPSF30 RNAi was induced by the addition of tetracycline (1 μg ml–1), and growth was monitored over a period of 2 weeks. At intervals, ∼2 × 106 cells were harvested, spread onto microscope slides, and then air-dried for 10 min. The cells were then fixed in methanol at –20 °C for at least 20 min. The cells were rehydrated in PBS, and then slides were incubated with 4,6-diamidine-2, phenylindole for 5 min. Finally, the cells were washed in PBS three times and mounted in MOWIOL (Harlow Chemical Co., Kent, UK) containing phenylene diamine (1 mg ml–1). Slides were examined on a Zeiss Axioscop 2 microscope, and images were captured using Scion Image version 1.62. Figures were processed using Adobe Photoshop 6.0. The tbCPSF30 locus was mapped using the T. brucei data bases at the Sanger Institute (available on the World Wide Web at www.sanger.ac.uk/Projects/T_brucei/) and at the Institute for Genomic Research (available on the World Wide Web at www.tigr.org/tdb/mdb/tdbd/index.shtml). These same databases were screened, using Blast analysis (16Altschul S.F. Gish W. Miller W. Myers E.W. Lipman D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (69141) Google Scholar), against both the yeast and mammalian proteins known to be involved in 3′-end formation.RESULTStbCPSF30 —As part of our interest in the family of proteins containing the RNA-binding CCCH zinc finger, we searched the trypanosome genome data base for genes encoding proteins containing this motif. As a search motif, we used the CCCH zinc finger sequence from tbZFP2, a molecule implicated in T. brucei cellular differentiation (10Hendriks E.F. Robinson D.R. Hinkins M. Matthews K.R. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 6700-6711Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). This identified a sequence predicted to encode part of a protein containing five CCCH zinc finger motifs as well as two zinc knuckle motifs conforming to the CX 2CX 4HX 4C structure (Fig. 1A). tbZFP2 has a CX 8CX 5CX 3H zinc finger, typical of the family, whose best studied member is Tristetraprolin (TTP, also known as TIS11 and NUP475) (17Lai W.S. Carballo E. Strum J.R. Kennington E.A. Phillips R.S. Blackshear P.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4311-4323Crossref PubMed Scopus (621) Google Scholar, 18Carballo E. Lai W.S. Blackshear P.J. Science. 1998; 281: 1001-1005Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, the five CCCH motifs in the newly identified gene had a degenerate spacing between the first two coordinating cysteine residues in the sequence (CX 8CX 4CX 3H and CX 7CX 5CX 3H; see Fig. 1B). Consequently, the gene, although a member of the tbZFP family of proteins as defined by the presence of the CCCH motif (Fig. 1B), represents a distinct subclass of this family.The complete gene sequence was obtained by a combination of clone walking (within the data base) and PCR between the intervening sequence of contiguous clones. The resulting predicted sequence was then verified by sequencing the entire gene isolated from genomic DNA by PCR amplification. tBlastx analysis of the complete coding region demonstrated strong homology to the protein sequence for the cleavage and polyadenylation specificity factor 30-kDa subunit (CPSF30) from several organisms (34% identity and 65% similarity to yeast, 35% identity and 58% similarity to cow) (Fig. 1A). In addition to the conservation of the overall zinc finger motif structure (Fig. 1C), there were several further highly conserved regions of identity within the molecule and members of the CPSF30 family. On the basis of its strong homology to CPSF30 from several organisms, the gene was designated as the T. brucei cleavage and polyadenylation specificity factor 30-kDa subunit, tbCPSF30.tbCPSF30 Is Expressed in Bloodstream and Procyclic Life Cycle Stages—In Drosophila, the CPSF30 homologue (Clipper, or CLP) is not ubiquitously expressed; it is absent during embryonic development (19Bai C. Tolias P.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6661-6667Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Since tbCPSF30 and CLP shared the greatest structural similarity (see Fig. 1C), the expression pattern of tbCPSF30 was assessed during the trypanosome developmental cycle. Total RNA was prepared from bloodstream and procyclic form parasites and hybridized with a riboprobe made to the coding region of tbCPSF30. This analysis revealed that tbCPSF30 was expressed at both these life cycle stages in similar abundance (Fig. 2A). The message was ∼1100 nucleotides, in agreement with the predicted size of the coding region (831 bp) plus ∼200–300 nucleotides of 5′- and 3′-untranslated regions. Southern analysis showed that tbCPSF30 was a single copy gene (data not shown).Fig. 2tbCPSF30 is constitutively expressed in T. brucei. A, Northern analysis of tbCPSF30 expression in monomorphic bloodstream (Bs) and procyclic forms (Pc). The message is expressed at the same level in each life cycle stage and is ∼1100 nucleotides in size. Relative RNA loadings are indicated by the panel showing ethidium bromide-stained RNA samples (EtBr). B, Western analysis of tbCPSF30 expression in monomorphic bloodstream SMB and procyclic 29-13 forms, using the affinity-purified anti-peptide antibody to tbCPSF30 (αtbCPSF30). Two bands were always detected with this antibody; the reason for this is not known. The protein is ∼32–34 kDa in size and is equally expressed in bloodstream and procyclic forms. Preimmune tbCPSF30 serum did not detect any proteins (data not shown). Equal cell numbers were used to prepare each sample, and equivalent loading was confirmed by analysis of the Ponceau S-stained blot (not shown).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)In the case of the Drosophila CLP, the protein and RNA expression pattern do not coincide due to developmental regulation at the post-transcriptional level (20Bai C. Tolias P.P. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 1597-1604Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). To verify that the expression pattern observed for tbCPSF30 at the RNA level also reflected protein expression, an antibody was generated to two peptide antigens (LIERADDPSFNKNATC and QQWGGHRRGDATGRQ) derived from the C terminus of tbCPSF30, away from the conserved five CCCH zinc fingers and two zinc knuckle motifs. Protein samples were prepared from both bloodstream and procyclic forms and subjected to Western analysis with the specific tbCPSF30 anti-peptide antibody. The purified tbCPSF30 antibody detected two bands of ∼32–34 kDa (Fig. 2B). This double band was always observed in several different parental or wild type cell lines, although the relative proportion of each did vary between samples. We believe that both bands are tbCPSF30 and that they represent different forms of the protein (i.e. they may represent a processed or post-transcriptionally modified form of the protein). This has not been further examined; however, it is interesting to note that in vitro purification of mammalian polyadenylation complexes also indicated the presence of two forms of CPSF30 (28 and 30 kDa) (21Veraldi K.L. Edwalds-Gilbert G. MacDonald C.C. Wallace A.M. Milcarek C. RNA. 2000; 6: 768-777Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Moreover, both bands disappear upon tbCPSF30-specific transcript ablation (see below). Fig. 2B confirms that tbCPSF30 is expressed equally in both bloodstream and procyclic life cycle stages, contrasting with the developmental regulation demonstrated by Drosophila CLP.Gene Silencing of tbCPSF30 Causes Cell Death—The polyadenylation machinery comprises a complex of proteins of precise stoichiometry. We therefore assessed the functional consequences of ectopic overexpression and RNAi-mediated depletion of tbCPSF30. Initially, we used the trypanosome expression vector pHD451 (12Biebinger S. Wirtz L.E. Lorenz P. Clayton C. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1997; 85: 99-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar) to generate bloodstream and procyclic form lines that overexpressed a TY-1 epitope-tagged copy of tbCPSF30. Transgenic tbCPSF30-TY could be clearly detected in both life cycle stages (Fig. 3A), being overexpressed 2-fold in bloodstream forms and 3–5-fold in the procyclic form with respect to the endogenous protein (data not shown). These cell lines were morphologically identical to the parental lines and grew at an identical rate (Fig. 3B). Thus, no adverse effects result from tbCPSF30 overexpression in either life cycle stage.Fig. 3Ectopic overexpression of tbCPSF30 does not generate detectable phenotype. A, Western analysis of bloodstream and procyclic parental forms (Bs449 and Pc449) expressing ectopic tbCPSF30, probed with the antibody BB2 specific for the TY1 epitope tag (top panel). +, induction with tetracycline. The bottom panel shows the same protein samples probed with an antibody to trypanosome α-tubulin (TAT) to indicate loading. B, growth analysis of tbCPSF30 bloodstream (Bs) or procyclic (Pc) trypanosomes expressing ectopic tbCPSF30 under the control of a tetracycline-inducible promoter grown in the presence (+) and absence (–) of tetracycline. The induced parental strains Bs449 and Pc449 (expressing the tetracycline repressor alone) are also shown. Cells were monitored for 8 days, being maintained at between 2 × 105 and 3–4 × 106 by passage. All cultures were grown in the presence of selective drugs.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Further functional analysis of the gene product was carried out using gene silencing by RNAi (22Ngo H. Tschudi C. Gull K. Ullu E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 14687-14692Crossref PubMed Scopus (599) Google Scholar). The tbCPSF30 coding region was cloned into the vector p2T7i (13LaCount D.J. Barrett B. Donelson J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 17580-17588Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar) and transfected into bloodstream SMB cells and procyclic 29-13 cells, which express the tetracycline repressor and T7 RNA polymerase, allowing tetracycline-inducible transcript ablation by RNAi. Transfected cells were induced with 1 μgml–1 tetracycline, and cell growth was monitored for a period of 12–14 days for both bloodstream and procyclic tbCPSF30 RNAi cell lines as well as for untransfected controls (Fig. 4, A and B). Cell morphology was also monitored during this period (Fig. 4, C and D). Upon induction with tetracycline, there was a striking growth phenotype in both bloodstream and procyclic tbCPSF30 RNAi cell lines but not in the control populations. Specifically, cells were able to proliferate for only 2–3 days, after which many dead cells were detectable in the induced bloodstream and procyclic populations. By 6 days postinduction, tbCPSF30 RNAi procyclic cell lines were dead or dying as shown in the growth profile (Fig. 4B) and the culture image (Fig. 4D). Similarly, the bloodstream population stopped proliferating by days 3–5, although some surviving cells were always detectable among a background of lysed cells (middle right panel in Fig. 4C). Interestingly, by day 6–8, the bloodstream cells had resumed growth, and at day 12–14, their proliferation was indistinguishable from uninduced lines or the parental SMB line (Fig. 4, A and C). We predicted that the outgrowth of these cells represented selection for those unable to undergo tbCPSF30 RNAi.Fig. 4tbCPSF30 is required for viability in bloodstream and procyclic form T. brucei. A and B show the growth of bloodstream and procyclic form tbCPSF30 RNAi cells compared with the control bloodstream SMB and procyclic 29–13 cell lines. In each case, cells were grown either in the presence (+) or absence (–) of tetracycline. Cells were monitored for 2 weeks, being maintained at between 2 × 105 and 3–4 × 106 by passage. All cultures were grown in the presence of selective drugs. C, phase-contrast images of SMB bloodstream cells (left panels) and tbCPSF30 RNAi bloodstream cells (right panels) at 0, 4, and 12 days after the induction of RNAi with tetracycline.

The cell images in C and D are derived from the same populations shown in Fig. 4, A and B. Since the procyclic tbCPSF30 RNAi cells were no longer growing by day 14, this image shows cells from the total remaining culture volume.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To assess the efficacy of RNAi in each population, we assayed the level of tbCPSF30 RNA at time points after induction with tetracycline. It was expected that the RNA levels for tbCPSF30 would show rapid ablation upon induction with tetracycline in bloodstream and procyclic forms. Surprisingly, however, Northern analysis showed that in both induced bloodstream and procyclic cell lines, an RNA of aberrant size was detected with the tbCPSF30 strand-specific riboprobe (Fig. 5). This RNA was slightly larger than the tbCPSF30 mRNA detected in uninduced or parental cell lines, and it was also increased in abundance when compared with normal tbCPSF30 mRNA levels (Fig. 5, arrows). This unexpected result was reproducible in several independently derived bloodstream and procyclic form cell lines. Significantly, the altered tbCPSF30 RNA was observed only in induced RNAi cell lines and disappeared upon outgrowth of the RNAi-resistant bloodstream forms when the correct sized tbCPSF30 transcript reappeared (Fig. 5, day 12 samples). We excluded the possibility that this novel transcript represented double-stranded RNA transcribed from the tbCPSF30 RNAi vector by hybridization with an antisense-specific riboprobe. This revealed that no detectable levels of tbCPSF30 double-stranded RNA were present in either the bloodstream or procyclic RNAi cell lines (data not shown). All of these facts strongly suggested that the observed tbCPSF30 RNA was tbCPSF30 RNAi-specific and did not represent a cryptic tbCPSF30 RNA derived from the tbCPSF30 RNAi 2T7i construct.Fig. 5RNAi of tbCPSF30 results in the appearance of a novel tbCPSF30 RNA.

https://openalex.org/W2084164972,"RNase PH is one of the exoribonucleases that catalyze the 3′ end processing of tRNA in bacteria. RNase PH removes nucleotides following the CCA sequence of tRNA precursors by phosphorolysis and generates mature tRNAs with amino acid acceptor activity. In this study, we determined the crystal structure of Aquifex aeolicus RNase PH bound with a phosphate, a co-substrate, in the active site at 2.3-Å resolution. RNase PH has the typical α/β fold, which forms a hexameric ring structure as a trimer of dimers. This ring structure resembles that of the polynucleotide phosphorylase core domain homotrimer, another phosphorolytic exoribonuclease. Four amino acid residues, Arg-86, Gly-124, Thr-125, and Arg-126, of RNase PH are involved in the phosphate-binding site. Mutational analyses of these residues showed their importance in the phosphorolysis reaction. A docking model with the tRNA acceptor stem suggests how RNase PH accommodates substrate RNAs.

The processing of tRNA precursors into mature tRNAs involves several steps, including the removal of the 5′ and 3′ extension sequences (1Deutscher M.P. CRC Crit. Rev. Biochem. 1984; 17: 45-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 2Deutscher M.P. Soll D. RajBhandary U.L. tRNA: Structure, Biosynthesis, and Function.

Marchfelder A. Morl M. Biol. Chem. 2001; 382: 1147-1156Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). This removal of the 5′ and 3′ extension sequences is necessary for producing the CCA sequence, which is essential for tRNA aminoacylation and subsequent protein synthesis (2Deutscher M.P. Soll D. RajBhandary U.L. tRNA: Structure, Biosynthesis, and Function. American Society for Microbiology, Washington D. C.1995: 51-65Google Scholar, 3Morl M. Marchfelder A.

The 5′ extension is removed, in a single step reaction, by the ribonucleoprotein RNase P, which is conserved in all organisms (5Frank D.N. Pace N.R. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 153-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar). On the other hand, the removal of the 3′ extension is a more complex process. In archaea and eukaryotes, the 3′ extension sequence is removed by RNase Z in a single step reaction (6Schierling K. Rosch S. Rupprecht R. Schiffer S. Marchfelder A. J. Mol.

In Escherichia coli, the proposed 3′ processing pathway involves the following steps (2Deutscher M.P. Soll D. RajBhandary U.L. tRNA: Structure, Biosynthesis, and Function.

RNases E and III have been identified as participating in this first step. Then the endonucleolytic reaction is followed by the 5′-terminal processing by RNase P, if the 3′ trailer sequence of the tRNA precursor is short. However, if the tRNA precursor has a long 3′ trailer sequence, an exonucleolytic reaction removes some nucleotides from the 3′ end before RNase P processes the 5′ end. This exonucleolytic reaction involves RNases PH, T, BN, D, II, and polynucleotide phosphorylase. Finally, these exonucleases remove all of the nucleotides downstream of the CCA sequence; RNase PH and RNase T are usually most effective (8Li Z. Deutscher M.P. Cell. 1996; 86: 503-512Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). In this final trimming, RNase PH catalyzes a 3′ exonucleolytic, phosphorolytic reaction, which needs a phosphate as the co-substrate, and produces a nucleoside diphosphate (9Deutscher M.P. Marshall G.T. Cudny H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 4710-4714Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 10Kelly K.O. Deutscher M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 17153-17158Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). RNase PH was shown to catalyze the reverse reaction in vitro, the addition of nucleotides to the end of RNA molecules, by using a nucleoside diphosphate as a substrate (10Kelly K.O. Deutscher M.P. J.

RNase PH reportedly has activity with other small stable RNAs, such as M1, 6 S, 4.5 S RNA, and transfer-messenger RNA, in E. coli (12Li Z. Pandit S. Deutscher M.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2856-2861Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). These stable RNAs, like tRNA, have a common secondary structure of a stem with a 3′ single-stranded tail, which may be related to the substrate specificity of RNase PH (12Li Z. Pandit S. Deutscher M.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2856-2861Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). The phosphorolytic ribonucleases can be divided into two major families, the RNase PH family and the polynucleotide phosphorylase (PNPase) 1The abbreviations used are: PNPase, polynucleotide phosphorylase; SeMet, selenomethionine. family (13Mian I.S.

Trends Cell Biol. 2002; 12: 90-96Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). PNPase, the other type of phosphorolytic ribonuclease, is a large protein consisting of five domains, of which two in the central region are the “PNPase core domains” (13Mian I.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3187-3195Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar, 17Symmons M.F. Jones G.H. Luisi B.F. Structure Fold. Des. 2000; 8: 1215-1226Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (225) Google Scholar). The PNPase core domains are weakly homologous to the RNase PH family members in three regions (the total sequence identity is 20–30%) and are also called “RNase PH domains” (13Mian I.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3187-3195Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). In PNPase, the second PNPase core domain is more conserved than the first core domain; the catalytic site is conserved only in the second core domain (17Symmons M.F. Jones G.H. Luisi B.F. Structure Fold. Des. 2000; 8: 1215-1226Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (225) Google Scholar). Homologs of PNPase are found in bacteria and eukaryotes but not in archaea. In bacteria, PNPase nonspecifically removes the 3′ nucleotides of mRNAs (18Donovan W.P. Kushner S.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Structure Fold. Des. 2000; 8: 1215-1226Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (225) Google Scholar). In the PNPase structure, the two PNPase core domains form a homotrimeric ring (17Symmons M.F. Jones G.H. Luisi B.F. Structure Fold. Des. 2000; 8: 1215-1226Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (225) Google Scholar). In the present study, we determined the crystal structure of RNase PH from Aquifex aeolicus in a complex with a phosphate at 2.3-Å resolution. On the basis of this structure, we carried out site-directed mutagenesis, and we determined the crystal structures of the mutants and thus identified the catalytic site of the RNase PH activity. Based on our docking model with RNA, we discuss how RNase PH stops the 3′ end trimming at the CCA terminus. Cloning, Protein Expression, and Purification of A. aeolicus RNase PH—The A. aeolicus RNase PH gene was amplified by PCR from A. aeolicus genomic DNA and was cloned into the expression vector pET-26b(+) (Novagen) between the NdeI and SalI sites to construct pET-26b(+)-rph. The wild type RNase PH was overexpressed in E. coli strain BL21-CodonPlus (DE3). Cells were grown in LB medium containing 50 μg/ml kanamycin and 34 μg/ml chloramphenicol at 37 °C until the A 600 was ∼0.5, and then isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside was added to a 1mm concentration. Cells were grown at 37 °C for an additional3hand were harvested by centrifugation. The pellet was resuspended in buffer A (20 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.0) containing 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and was homogenized by sonication. The extract was heated for 30 min at 70 °C to denature most of the E. coli proteins. The heat-treated fraction was centrifuged, and the supernatant fraction was loaded onto a Q-Sepharose Fast Flow column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with buffer A. The protein was eluted with a linear gradient of 0.05–1 m NaCl. The RNase PH fraction was pooled, and buffer B (buffer A containing 3.5 m (NH4)2SO4) was added so that the final concentration of (NH4)2SO4 in the protein solution reached 1.5 m; the resultant solution was then loaded onto a RESOURCE PHE column (Amersham Biosciences). The protein was eluted with a linear gradient of 1.5 to 0 m (NH4)2SO4, and was purified to more than 95% homogeneity with a yield of 1–2 mg of purified protein from 1 liter of LB medium, as judged by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 1). The R86A mutant gene was made by oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis, using the plasmid pET-26b(+)-rph as a template, and was ligated into the pET-26b(+) vector. The expression plasmids containing the T125A or R126A mutant genes were made by the QuickChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene), using pET-26b(+)-rph as a template and following the instructions of the supplier. The nucleotide sequences of the genes were confirmed by dideoxy sequencing. All of the RNase PH mutants were purified by the same procedure as that used for the wild type enzyme. Crystallization of RNase PH—Prior to crystallization, the RNase PH fraction was dialyzed against buffer C (20 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.0) containing 5 mm MgCl2, 50 mm KCl, and 10 mm NaH2PO4) and was concentrated to ∼1.5 mg/ml by ultrafiltration. Crystallization was accomplished by the hanging drop vapor diffusion method. The crystals were obtained at 20 °C by mixing equal volumes (1:1 each) of the protein solution and a reservoir solution (2 m (NH4)2SO4), and equilibrating the mixture with the reservoir solution. The crystals grew to a maximum size of 0.3 × 0.3 × 0.15 mm3. The crystals belong to the space group P6322, with unit cell constants of a = b = 145.4 Å, c = 82.5 Å, and contain one molecule in the asymmetric unit. The selenomethionine (SeMet) derivative was prepared by overexpression of RNase PH in the Met– E. coli strain B834(DE3) with Codon Plus plasmids and was purified and crystallized by the same procedures used for the native protein. The RNase PH gene for the SeMet derivative was accidentally mutagenized to Q80R/Q120I by a PCR error. However, these mutations did not affect the crystallization and the data collection. All of the mutant proteins were crystallized by the same procedure as that for the wild type protein. Data Collection and Structure Determination—The multiwavelength anomalous dispersion data set of the SeMet derivative and the native and mutant protein data sets were collected from beamline BL41XU at SPring-8 (Harima, Japan). To reduce the radiation damage during the measurement, the multiwavelength anomalous dispersion data set was collected at 30 K using a helium cryostream. The data were processed and scaled with the program HKL2000 (22Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38605) Google Scholar). Six selenium sites were picked out of the seven selenium sites expected in the asymmetric unit, using SnB (23Weeks C.M. Miller R. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1999; 32: 120-124Crossref Scopus (384) Google Scholar). The selenium parameters were refined, and the initial phases were calculated using SHARP (24de La Fortelle E. Bricogne G. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 472-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (1797) Google Scholar). The resulting initial phases were extended to 2.9 Å by density modification with the program RESOLVE (25Terwilliger T.C. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2000; 56: 965-972Crossref PubMed Scopus (1635) Google Scholar). The atomic model was built using O (26Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13014) Google Scholar) and was refined using CNS (27Adams P.D. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Brunger A.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Crystallogr. 1997; 30: 1022-1025Crossref Scopus (4173) Google Scholar), with the 2.9-Å SeMet derivative models as a search model. The model of the native crystal was built and refined in a similar manner as that of the SeMet derivative structure. The phasing and refinement statistics are shown in Table I. The structure of the wild type protein was used as a starting model for the refinement of all three mutant proteins using CNS (27Adams P.D. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Brunger A.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.

Open table in a new tab RNase PH Phosphorolysis Assay—For the RNase PH phosphorolysis assay, a tRNA precursor substrate, tRNAVal-CCA-CCTGAGAA (tRNA-CCA-N8), was prepared by T7 RNA polymerase-directed in vitro transcription. The phosphorolysis reactions were performed in 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.0) containing 50 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm NaH2PO4, 300 nm of tRNA precursor substrate, and 30 nm RNase PH. The samples were incubated for 0, 20, 40, or 60 min at 65 °C. After extractions with phenol/chloroform, the products were resolved by denaturing 12% polyacrylamide, 8 m urea gel electrophoresis and were stained with 0.1% toluidine blue. Assay for tRNA Binding—A tRNA precursor substrate, tRNAVal-CCA-CC (tRNA-CCA-N2), was prepared by the same procedure as that for tRNA-CCA-N8. The tRNA-binding reactions were performed at 37 °C in 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.0) containing 50 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, ±10 mm NaH2PO4, 35 nm of 32P-labeled tRNA precursor substrate, and 44, 88, or 176 nm of the proteins. After a 10-min incubation, the samples were resolved by 5% PAGE and were visualized by autoradiography of the gel. Overall Structure of RNase PH—The crystal of A. aeolicus RNase PH (28 kDa) belongs to the space group P6322 and contains a single subunit in the asymmetric unit. The crystal structure of RNase PH was solved by the multiwavelength anomalous dispersion method at 2.3-Å resolution. The final model of RNase PH consists of all of the residues, except for the N-terminal methionine residue and has an R work of 23.3% and an R free of 27.5% (Table I). Six subunits, which are related by crystallographic symmetry, form a hexameric ring structure as a trimer of dimers (Fig. 2, A and B). This ring has 32 symmetry, and the molecular 3-fold axis corresponds to the crystallographic 3-fold axis (Fig. 2A). Actually, A. aeolicus RNase PH also forms a hexamer in solution, as the average molecular mass of the RNase PH sample was estimated to be about 170 kDa (6.1 × 28 kDa) by the ultracentrifugation analysis (data not shown). On the other hand, the E. coli RNase PH tends to self-associate and to form multimers of various sizes (10Kelly K.O. Deutscher M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 17153-17158Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The overall architecture of RNase PH is a βαβα fold (Fig. 2C). The dimerization interface consists of three parts of the molecules: the N terminus of helix α6 forms the outer face of the molecule, the N terminus of helix α3 is near the center of the ring, and the β-strand β9 is between these α-helixes (Fig. 2, B and C). These α3, α6, and β9 structures interact with those of the adjacent subunit, respectively, and therefore, the antiparallel β-sheet consisting of β6 –β9 extends to an adjacent subunit (Fig. 2, B and C). The trimerization interface is composed of the loop connecting β1 and β2, the region through η1 to α2, and half of the 6-stranded β-sheets (β3–β5) (Fig. 2, A and C). On the other hand, the other half of the β-sheet (β1–β2 and β12) is exposed to the solvent and forms an intermolecular cleft (Fig. 2, A and C). The outer face of the hexameric ring consists of one long α-helix (α6) running across the intermolecular β-sheet, as mentioned above (Fig. 2, A and B). The buried surface area of the dimer is 1460 Å2 and that of the trimer is 1440 Å2. The central hole of the hexameric ring is made up of the α2 helix (Fig. 2, A and C), but this region is partially disordered. The diameter of the central hole is about 5 Å, which is smaller than that of a nucleotide. Structural Comparison between RNase PH and PNPase— The crystal structure of S. antibioticus PNPase, which has the duplicated “PNPase core domains” and the three accessory domains, was determined previously (17Symmons M.F. Jones G.H. Luisi B.F. Structure Fold. Des. 2000; 8: 1215-1226Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (225) Google Scholar). In the PNPase structure, the two PNPase core domains, which are related by pseudosymmetry, homotrimerically form the core ring, with the other domains placed on its upper and lower faces (17Symmons M.F. Jones G.H. Luisi B.F. Structure Fold. Des. 2000; 8: 1215-1226Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (225) Google Scholar). The overall structure of A. aeolicus RNase PH is similar to that of the core-domain ring of S. antibioticus PNPase. The homodimeric structure of A. aeolicus RNase PH corresponds to the pseudosymmetric structure of the duplicated PNPase core domains. The A. aeolicus RNase PH structure superimposes well on the second PNPase core domain structure, with a root mean square deviation (r.m.s.d.) of 1.5 Å over 198 corresponding Cα atoms (Fig. 3). There are several differences between the two structures. First, helix α4of A. aeolicus RNase PH is much longer than the corresponding helix α10 of PNPase (Fig. 4). Second, the loop connecting β6 and β7 of A. aeolicus RNase PH is shorter than that of the PNPase. Third, A. aeolicus RNase PH has a 20-residue extension at the C terminus (β10, β11, and β12) (Figs. 3 and 4). The three C-terminal β-strands of A. aeolicus RNase PH form the cleft between the dimers in the trimeric arrangement (Figs. 2A and 4). Furthermore, a Dali search (29Holm L. Sander C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 316-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (598) Google Scholar) of the Protein Data Bank with the coordinates of A. aeolicus RNase PH revealed that its N-terminal domain (residues 24–140 and 200–240) shares structurally homologous parts with homoserine kinase (30Zhou T. Daugherty M. Grishin N.V. Osterman A.L. Zhang H. Structure Fold. Des. 2000; 8: 1247-1257Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (108) Google Scholar) and ribosomal protein S5 (31Ramakrishnan V. White S.W. Nature. 1992; 358: 768-771Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). According to the SCOP classification (32Murzin A.G. Brenner S.E. Hubbard T. Chothia C. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 247: 536-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (5607) Google Scholar), homoserine kinase and ribosomal protein S5 have the same 2-layer βββαβα sandwich fold, named the ribosomal protein S5 domain 2-like fold. The ribosomal protein S5 domain 2-like fold superfamily includes the PNPase core domain, the RNase P protein, and ribosomal protein S9. The structural similarity between the PNPase core domain and the RNase P protein was mentioned previously (17Symmons M.F. Jones G.H. Luisi B.F. Structure Fold. Des. 2000; 8: 1215-1226Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (225) Google Scholar). Phosphate Binding—In the present electron density map for the RNase PH crystal, a strong electron density peak (>5σ) was observed and modeled well as a bound phosphate. It is possible that the bound phosphate corresponds to the inorganic phosphate or the phosphodiester phosphate of RNA in the phosphorolysis reaction. This phosphate-binding site is at the bottom of a cleft formed by the helices α3–α5 and the β-sheets β6 –β9 (Figs. 2C and 5A). As the RNase PH subunit has one phosphate-binding site, the hexameric ring has three active sites on both sides (Fig. 2A). The phosphate is surrounded by the N-terminal parts of helices α3 and α4 (Fig. 5A). The phosphate is accommodated in a pocket formed by the side chains of Arg-86 (α3), Thr-125 (α4), and Arg-126 (α4) and the main chain NH group of Gly-124; one oxygen atom interacts with the Arg-86 N-ζ, the Thr-125 O-γ, and one water, two interact with the Arg-126 N-ϵ and N-ζ, and one interacts with the Gly-124 NH (Fig. 5A). The four phosphate-interacting amino acid residues are strictly conserved in the bacterial RNase PH sequences (Fig. 4). As shown in Fig. 5B, the structure of the phosphate-binding site on RNase PH superimposes well on that of the corresponding site on the second PNPase core domain, which is partially occupied by a phosphate analog, tungstate (17Symmons M.F. Jones G.H. Luisi B.F. Structure Fold. Des. 2000; 8: 1215-1226Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (225) Google Scholar). Four residues, His-427, Ser-461, Thr-462, and Ser-463, of S. antibioticus PNPase interact with the tungstate (Fig. 5B) (17Symmons M.F. Jones G.H. Luisi B.F. Structure Fold. Des. 2000; 8: 1215-1226Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (225) Google Scholar). In PNPases, His-427, Ser-461, and Ser-463 are strictly conserved. On the other hand, the position corresponding to Thr-462 is either Ser or Thr, but Ser is more common than Thr (Fig. 4). In contrast, the phosphate-binding site consists of four residues, Arg-86, Gly-124, Thr-125, and Arg-126, in A. aeolicus RNase PH (Fig. 5A). Therefore, the corresponding active sites of S. antibioticus PNPase and A. aeolicus RNase PH share only one Thr residue (Thr-462 and Thr-125, respectively). In addition to the four tungstate-binding residues listed above, Arg-423 of S. antibioticus PNPase is conserved in other PNPases. Interestingly, the C-α position of Arg-423 in S. antibioticus PNPase is similar to that of Arg-86 in A. aeolicus RNase PH, whereas the Arg-423 side chain is directed away from the tungstate (Fig. 5B). Therefore, it may be possible that Arg-423 is also involved in the phosphorolytic reaction by S. antibioticus PNPase. Actually, in the previous study of E. coli PNPase, the phosphorolytic activity was completely abolished by the double Asp mutation of Arg-398/Arg-399 (33Jarrige A. Brechemier-Baey D. Mathy N.

RNase PH Phosphorolysis Assay—To investigate whether the phosphate-interacting residues of RNase PH are critical for the phosphorolytic exoribonuclease activity, we constructed three alanine-substituted mutants, R86A, T125A, and R126A. In this study, we used tRNA-CCA-N8 as the tRNA precursor analog, and we detected the processing products directly by denaturing PAGE. A. aeolicus RNase PH rapidly digested the 3′-extended tRNA precursors and generated the mature size tRNA within 20 min (Fig. 6A). The three mutants exhibited the activity to different extents, with rather high enzyme concentrations (Fig. 6A). The R86A mutant showed no detectable products even after a 60-min incubation, and thus this mutant is completely inactive. The T125A mutant has marginal activity, producing RNA digests a few nucleotides shorter than tRNA-CCA-N8 after a 60-min incubation. The R126A mutant is significantly more active than the other two mutants but cannot cleave the precursor to the mature size even after a 60-min incubation. Therefore, the activities of the T125A and R126A mutants are much lower than that of the wild type. These results show that the three strictly conserved residues, Arg-86, Thr-125, and Arg-126, are very important for the phosphorolytic activity of the bacterial RNase PH. Gel Shift and Crystallographic Analyses of RNase PH Mutants—We then performed two other experiments to investigate how these mutations affect the activity. To explore their effects on the tRNA binding ability, we performed gel shift assays using the tRNA precursor (tRNA-CCA-N2) (Fig. 6B). The wild type RNase PH caused the gel shift of the tRNA precursor in the presence of the phosphate ion (lanes 6–8, Fig. 6B). The amount of the gel-shifted tRNA precursor is smaller than that in the absence of the phosphate ion (lanes 2–4), probably because of electrostatic repulsion between the enzyme-bound phosphate ion and the phosphate group of the tRNA precursor. The three mutations had different effects on the tRNA precursor gel shift. First, the R86A mutant exhibited nearly the same level of gel-shifted tRNA as that of the wild type (lanes 9–11). Therefore, the replacement of Arg-86 by Ala does not affect the tRNA binding ability. By contrast, the T125A mutant gel-shifted more of the tRNA precursor than the wild type (lanes 12–14). The observed increase in the RNA binding ability by the T125A mutation might be due to a decrease in the putative electrostatic repulsion between the phosphate ion and the RNA phosphate group. On the other hand, the R126A mutant bound less RNA than the wild type (lanes 15–17). The low tRNA binding ability of the R126A mutant may suggest that Arg-126 is involved in RNA binding rather than phosphate ion binding. Furthermore, we have determined the crystal structures of the three mutants at 2.3-Å resolution. These mutants were crystallized under the same conditions used for the wild type, and the overall structures were the same as that of the wild type, with root mean square deviation values of 0.18, 0.26, and 0.29 for R86A, T125A, and R126A respectively. In the present electron density maps for each of the three mutant crystals, the same election density peaks were present at the phosphate-binding site as that in the wild type crystal. However, the phosphate-binding modes slightly differ from each other (Fig. 7, A–C). In the R86A mutant, the phosphate position is the same as that of the wild type (Fig. 7A). In addition, the RNA binding ability of the R86A mutant is similar to that of the wild type (Fig. 6B). Hence, the replacement of Arg-86 by Ala has hardly any effect on the phosphate and RNA binding. Nevertheless, the R86A mutant showed no phosphorolytic activity (Fig. 6A). Therefore, Arg-86 may play an important role in the phosphorolysis reaction, although it is possible that a rearrangement of the phosphate-binding site might occur when the enzyme binds RNA. In the T125A mutant, the phosphate position is 0.39 Å away from that of the wild type, and the interaction between Arg-86 and the phosphate ion is abolished (Fig. 7B). On the other hand, the side chain of Arg-126 has moved together with the phosphate ion. These effects of the T125A mutation on the active site structure may be related to the decrease in the phosphorolytic activity and the increase in the tRNA precursor binding. In the R126A mutant, the phosphate position is shifted by 0.89 Å as compared with the wild type (Fig. 7C). As a result, the phosphate ion has no interaction with Arg-86 but remains within range of the interaction with Thr-125. Furthermore, the phosphate ion interacts with the side chain of Asn-188, which is conserved in bacterial RNases PH. The phosphorolysis activity of the R126A mutant is lower than that of the wild type but is much higher than those of the other two mutants (Fig. 6A). On the other hand, the R126A mutant has slightly lower binding affinity for the tRNA precursor than that of the wild type (Fig. 6B). The structural and mutational analyses of the present study suggest the following mechanisms for the phosphorolytic reaction by RNase PH. First, the Thr-125 and Arg-126 residues bind the phosphate ion (Figs. 5A and 7). The Arg-126 residue may also bind the diester phosphate group of the tRNA precursor. The RNA binding might change the phosphate ion-binding residues from Thr-125/Arg-126 to Thr-125/Asn-188, as in the R126A mutant (Fig. 7C). Then the Arg-86 is likely to interact with the two substrates for the phosphorolytic reaction. RNA Interaction Model—In the crystal structure, the phosphate-binding site is located in the bottom of a deep cleft (Fig. 2, A and B). The entrance of the cleft is narrowed by helix α1 and the following loop (residues 48–56) of the adjacent subunit related by the 2-fold symmetry. This overhanging region at the entrance allows only the 3′-terminal single-stranded region of the tRNA precursor to enter the active site (Fig. 2, B and C). Although the overhanging region has relatively high B-factors (about 65 Å2), we postulated that the narrow entrance of the active site cleft can discriminate single-stranded RNA from double-stranded RNA, and we constructed a local docking model with a tRNA acceptor stem derived from the yeast tRNAPhe (Protein Data Bank code 1EHZ (34Shi H. Moore P.B. RNA (New York). 2000; 6: 1091-1105Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar)). When the double-stranded acceptor stem of the tRNA is located closest to the cleft entrance, the four single-stranded nucleotides are long enough to reach the active site (Fig. 8, A and B). If the 3′ extension is shorter than four nucleotides, then it seems difficult for the 3′ end nucleotide to reach the active site. Therefore, the present model may be relevant to the mechanism in that RNase PH can remove non-base-paired nucleotides from a tRNA precursor with a long 3′ extension until it reaches the CCA terminus. RNase PH may process other RNAs with the same structural features (a stem followed by a single-stranded sequence at the 3′ end) in a similar manner. In our model, the dimer of RNase PH only interacts with the tRNA acceptor stem, and the other parts of the tRNA remain unbound. RNase PH has no other RNA binding domain, whereas PNPase has the KH and S1 domains. Therefore, the only possibility for any further interaction of RNase PH with the RNA substrate is that other RNase PH dimers in the hexameric ring interact with some distant part (e.g. the anticodon arm) of the tRNA precursor. It might also be possible that the tRNA precursor interacts with some other RNA-binding protein that associates with RNase PH (perhaps with other RNase PH subunits in the hexameric ring). On the other hand, the hexamer of RNase PH might dissociate into dimers, as in the case of E. coli RNase PH (10Kelly K.O. Deutscher M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 17153-17158Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), upon binding with the tRNA precursor. To reveal the precise mechanism of the tRNA 3′ end processing by bacterial RNase PH, further studies, such as the structure determination of a complex of RNase PH and an RNA substrate, are necessary.

https://openalex.org/W2091983239,"N-Methyl-d -aspartate (NMDA) receptor subunit 2A (NR2A) is an important modulatory component of the NMDA subtype of glutamate receptors. To investigate the transcription mechanism of the NR2A gene, we cloned the 5′-flanking sequence from a rat genomic library. RNA mapping with rat brain RNA revealed two sets of major and several minor transcription start points in a single exon of 1140 bp. Reporter gene and mutation studies indicated that core promoter activity resided in exon 1, whereas the 5′-flanking sequence up to 1.5 kb showed no significant impact on promoter activity. Fragments containing minor transcription start points were able to drive a reporter gene in transfected cells and produce nascent RNAs in an in vitro transcription system. All fragments tested showed more promoter activity in dissociated neurons of the rat embryonic cerebrocortex and cell lines expressing NR2A mRNA than that in glial cultures and non-neuronal cells. Within exon 1 there are three GC-box elements that displayed distinct binding affinity to both Sp1- and Sp4-like factors. Overexpression of Sp1 or Sp4, but not Sp3, significantly increased the activity of the promoter containing these elements. Inclusion of exon 2 and 3 sequences, which contain five short open-reading frames, attenuated promoter-driven reporter activity more than 3-fold but attenuated the level of reporter mRNA less than 1.4-fold. Our results suggest that the core promoter of the rat NR2A gene requires exon 1, that Sp factors positively regulate this core promoter, and that a post-transcriptional mechanism may negatively regulate expression of the gene.

The NR3 subunits exhibit an inhibitory role and form a glycine receptor when co-expressed with NR1 (4Chatterton J.E. Awobuluyi M. Premkumar L.S. Takahashi H. Talantova M. Shin Y. Cui J. Tu S.

Burnashev N. Laurie D.J. Sakmann B. Seeburg P.H. Neuron. 1994; 12: 529-540Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2840) Google Scholar). Several physiological and pathological factors have been shown to regulate its expression at the mRNA level. In neurons of the neonatal brain, NR2A mRNA is progressively increased during development (7Monyer H. Burnashev N. Laurie D.J. Sakmann B. Seeburg P.H.

The mRNA level of the NR2A gene in neurons is regulated by various factors, as mentioned above, but the mechanisms underlying the regulation remain for the most part unknown. As a first step toward elucidating these mechanisms, we characterized the promoter of the rat NR2A gene. We defined the transcription start points (TSPs) using RNase protection assay (RPA), rapid amplification of 5′ cDNA ends (5′-RACE), and in vitro transcription experiments. Then, we tested abilities of the isolated promoter to drive a reporter gene in cultured cells and to interact with nuclear Sp factors, as well as examined the impact of Sp factors on the promoter capability to drive the reporter gene. We further studied the effects of the 5′-untranslated region (5′-UTR) on NR2A gene expression at transcriptional and posttranscriptional levels.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—A rat genomic library harboring EcoRI partially digested DNA (Sprague-Dawley) in the lambda phage was purchased from Clontech (Palo Alto, CA). Antibodies against Sp1, Sp3, and Sp4 were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA) and from Upstate Biotechnology (Waltham, MA). DNA primers were synthesized either by Genemed Synthesis (South San Francisco, CA) or by the core facility of University of Maryland at Baltimore.Isolation of Genomic Sequence—To screen the rat genomic library for the NR2A promoter a probe was generated by PCR with an upstream primer GB54 (5′-GCTGCGAGCCCTGCTGCAGAG) and a downstream primer GB98 (5′-CAATAACGCCACCACGTTCACATC). The reaction employed rat liver genomic DNA as a template, and Ex Taq DNA polymerase (TaKaRa/PanVera, Madison, WI) to amplify DNA for 30 cycles of 30 s at 95 °C and 2 min at 68 °C. The resulting PCR product was treated with Klenow enzyme, cloned into pGEM3Zf(+) at the HincII site (Promega, Madison, WI), and sequenced as described previously (34Bai G. Kusiak J.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1152: 197-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The PCR product was confirmed to be NR2A genomic sequence, containing exons and introns, and named GB5498. Excised DNA probe (GB5498) was labeled in the presence of [α-32P]dATP (ICN Biomedicals, Irvine, CA) with a random primer extension kit following the manufacturer's instruction (Amersham Biosciences, Piscataway, NJ). Library screening was carried out as described previously (34Bai G. Kusiak J.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1152: 197-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). One positive clone named NR2A32E was digested completely by EcoRI to produce three fragments that were subcloned into pGEM3Zf(+) for sequencing. These subclones were named as NR2A32E32, NR2A32E11, and NR2A32E22. DNA sequencing was performed as described previously (34Bai G. Kusiak J.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1152: 197-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) or by the core facility of University of Maryland at Baltimore. Sequencing data were analyzed with Vector NTI software (InforMax, Bethesda, MD). DNA sequence of clone NR2A32E plus GB5498 was deposited in GenBank™ with an accession number of AY167029.RNA Mapping—RPAs were carried out as described previously (34Bai G. Kusiak J.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1152: 197-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Templates of riboprobes were generated by subcloning restriction fragments of clone 2A32E22 or PCR products of the clone or its subcloned fragments into pGEM3Zf(+) or pGEM-T vector (Promega). Primers used in PCR to generate templates are as follows in pairs: GB339 (5′-CACCCTCTCCGCAGTCCTGCTC) as downstream primer plus M13 reverse primer for riboprobe 4 and 5; GB461 (5′-AAGCAGCAAGTGTGTATG) as an upstream primer and GB462 (5′-CTGCTCCACGCAGGGCAC) as a downstream primer for riboprobe 11. NR2A genomic sequences covered by each riboprobe are illustrated in Fig. 1. Sequences contributed by vectors are as follows: 29 nucleotides (nt) for riboprobes 1–3, 92 nt for riboprobe 4, 59 for riboprobe 5, 38 for riboprobes 6–8, 31 for riboprobe 9, 38 for riboprobe 10, and 46 for riboprobe 11. Correction of RNA migration to a DNA sequencing ladder was done as described previously (34Bai G. Kusiak J.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1152: 197-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). 5′-RACE was performed with a Marathon cDNA Amplification kit (Clontech) or a GeneRacer kit (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) following the manufacturer's instructions. Total RNA was extracted from the adult rat brain and liver (Sprague-Dawley) with a guanidinium isothiocyanate/CsCl method as described previously (35Bai G. Weiss B. J. Cell. Physiol. 1991; 149: 414-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Rat brain poly(A)+ RNA was purchased from Clontech or prepared as described previously (35Bai G. Weiss B. J. Cell. Physiol. 1991; 149: 414-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). DNA contamination in RNA extracts was monitored by directly running 1 μg of RNA samples in PCR with primers designed for the rat NR2A cDNA (see below). Any samples showing DNA contamination were not used. Primers used for 5′-RACE with a Marathon cDNA Amplification kit (Clontech) were GB97 (5′-GGCAATACCAGCAAGGTCCAGTAG) and GB98 (5′-CAATAACGCCACCACGTTCACATC), and those for RNA ligase-mediated (RLM) 5′-RACE with a GeneRacer kit were GB390 (5′-GCGTTCGGTTCCTCACTTGGTCAG), GB391 (5′-TGTGAGTGAGTGAGTGTGGGAGT), and GB462 (5′-CTGCTCCACGCAGGGCAC).In Vitro Transcription—In vitro transcription was performed on the basis of a protocol described by Schwartz et al. with modifications (36Schwartz M.L. Schlaepfer W.W. Methods. 1996; 10: 320-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). Briefly, nuclei were isolated from adult rat brain (Sprague-Dawley) by centrifugation on a sucrose phase and resuspended in nuclear buffer (10 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 3 mm MgCl2, 0.1 m EDTA, 1 mm DTT, 0.1 m phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 15% glycerol, 10 μg/ml each of bestatin, leupeptin, and aprotinin). Crude nuclear proteins were obtained by addition of an equal volume of nuclear buffer supplemented with 0.7 m KCl, rotation for 15 min at 4 °C, and centrifugation at 125,000 × g for 20 min. Crude nuclear proteins underwent ammonium sulfate precipitation and dialysis against a buffer consisting of 25 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 100 mm KCl, 15% glycerol, 0.25 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, and 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Protein concentration was determined by the Brandt method (Bio-Rad). For in vitro transcription, 0.1 pmol of NR2A promoter-luciferase constructs were mixed with 50 μg of nuclear proteins in a transcription buffer (40 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm DTT). Reactions were pre-run at 30 °C for 30 min. Then, 10 mm rNTP and 40 units of RNasin (Promega) per reaction were added for a further incubation at 30 °C for 30 min. Then, 1 μl of RNasin (40 units, Promega) and 2 μl of RNase-free DNase (2 units, Promega) were added for incubation at 37 °C for 20 min to remove DNA templates. The reaction was quenched by addition of a stopping buffer (40 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 20 mm EDTA, 25 μg/ml yeast tRNA, 0.2 m sodium acetate, and 1% SDS). RNA in the reactions was then extracted with a conventional phenol/chloroform method and subjected to RNase protection assay with riboprobe 8, 9, or 11 as described above. RNase A and T1 were used to digest single-stranded RNA. Protected RNAs were denatured and fractionated on 6% PAGE-7 m urea-TBE gel. 32P-Labeled ϕX174 DNA digested by HinfIII was used as a DNA ladder. Autoradiography was recorded with Kodak BioMax x-ray film.Construction of NR2A-reporter Plasmids—A 2896-bp fragment consisting of 1548-bp 5′-flanking sequence and 1348 bp of the 1349-bp 5′-untranslated region (5′-UTR) of the rat NR2A gene was prepared by combining an EcoRI-XbaI fragment of NR2A32E22 with an XbaI/filledin-StyI fragment of a 5′-RACE product. The 2896-bp fragment was cloned into pGEM3Zf(+) at EcoRI/HincII sites to form pG2A2896. This plasmid was digested with EcoRI and HindIII and the resulting NR2A fragment was cloned into pGL2basic (Promega) at the XhoI/HindIII sites by a ligation-fill-in-ligation strategy to form pNR2A2897Δ1. pNR2A2897Δ338 was prepared by subcloning the EcoRI-XbaI region of the 2896-bp fragment into pGL2basic. Digesting pNR2A2897Δ338 with ApaI-HindIII or BglII-HindIII followed by fill-in-ligation of the vector produced pNR2A2897Δ576 and pNR2A2897Δ1071, respectively. To create pNR2A2897Δ822 or pNR2A2897Δ1703, a SacI or NheI fragment of pNR2A2897Δ338 was inserted into pGL2Basic. pNR2A2897Δ1223 was produced by replacing the proximal 2301-bp sequence in pNR2A2897Δ1 with fragment (–2302/–1223) at the PstI sites. pNR2A2897Δ1234, pNR2A2897Δ1352, and pNR2A2897Δ1380 were generated with PCR using GB492 (5′-TTAAAATCAAAAACATATATAC), GB493 (5′-TCTTCTCTAAGTTGTTCCAGAC), and GB494 (5′-GGAGCCCTGTGGTTGGCACT), respectively, with M13 –20 primer on the pG2A2896 and replacing the XhoI-HindIII region of pNR2A2897Δ338 with the PCR products. 5′ deletions of the 2897-bp fragment were conducted to produce constructs lacking the 338 or 822 bp of the proximal 5′-UTR. NheI digestion and vector self-ligation of pNR2A2897Δ338 and pNR2A2897Δ822 created pNR2A1706Δ338 and pNR2A1706Δ822, respectively. pNR2A1229Δ822 was produced by inserting the HincII-SacI fragment of a pG2A2896 subclone into pGL2Basic at the Smal/SacI sites. A BglII/SacI fragment of pNR2A1229Δ822 was ligated to pGL2basic to form pNR2A1077Δ822. pNR2A1352Δ822 was derived from riboprobe 11. The SacI-HindIII fragment of pNR2A2897Δ338 was inserted into pNR2A1352Δ822 to produce pNR2A1352Δ338, into pNR2A1229Δ822 to form pNR2A1229Δ338, and into pGL2basic to create pNR2A822Δ338. Construct pNR2A1072Δ338 was formed by ligation of a BglII-HindIII fragment of pNR2A2897Δ338 to pGL2basic. Vector self-ligation of ApaI-Smal-treated pNR2A822Δ338 produced pNR2A580Δ338. pNR2A1700Δ1223 was formed by subcloning an NheI-HindIII fragment of pNR2A2897Δ1223 to pGL2Basic. pNR2A1228Δ1071 was produced by vector self-ligation of BglII-digested pNR2A1228Δ338. Subcloning a BamHI/XbaI fragment of pNR2A2897Δ576 to pGL2Basic at the XhoI-XbaI sites generated pNR2A822Δ576. Pfu-turbo DNA polymerase (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) was used in all PCRs above, and the fidelity of PCR products was examined by DNA sequencing.Cell Culture, Transfection, and Reporter Gene Assay—PC12, HeLa, HEK293, and P19 cells were maintained and transfected as described previously (37Bai G.

Co-transfection of cDNA expression constructs was conducted with a 4:1 ratio to luciferase constructs in addition to a CMV-LacZ construct (pCMVβgal) at one-tenth of total DNA, and pDNA3 was used as vector DNA for co-transfection. Luciferase activity was normalized to β-galactosidase activity. Sp factor constructs were described in previous studies (39Liu A. Prenger M.S. Norton D.D. Mei L. Kusiak J.W. Bai G. J. Biol.

Briefly, cells were dissociated from the cerebral cortex of rat embryos at gastrulation day 15 as described previously (38Krainc D. Bai G. Okamoto S. Carles M. Kusiak J.W. Brent R.N. Lipton S.A. J.

At day 8 of culture in vitro, more than 95% of cells were neurons proved by both morphology and microtubule-associated protein 2 immunostaining. At the same time, cells were transfected with DNA using LipofectAMIN2000. LipofectAMIN2000 was mixed with DNA at a ratio of 2 μl:1 μg, and 2.5 μg of DNA was used for cells cultured in a 10-cm2 surface. DNA constructs of the NR2A promoter luciferase gene and pCMVβgal (9:1) were transfected to cells. Two days after transfection, cells were lysed for reporter gene assays as described previously (39Liu A. Prenger M.S. Norton D.D. Mei L. Kusiak J.W. Bai G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 45372-45379Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Transfection efficiency was about 5% determined by green fluorescent cells after transfection of pEGFP (Invitrogen). Glial cells were isolated from the cerebrocortex of rats at postnatal day 1 and cultured for 8 days before transfection as described by Plesnila et al. (40Plesnila N. Zinkel S. Le D.A. Amin-Hanjani S. Wu Y. Qiu J. Chiarugi A. Thomas S.S. Kohane D.S. Korsmeyer S.J. Moskowitz M.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 15318-15323Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). Transfection and reporter gene assays were performed as described for neurons.Reverse Transcription-PCR—Total RNA was extracted from rat and mouse brains as described above and from cultured cells with TRIzol (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer's instructions. Human brain RNA was obtained from Dr. John W. Kusiak at the National Institutes of Health. RNA was treated with RNase-free DNase (Promega) and recovered with an RNA clean kit (Zymo Research, Orange, CA). 2 μg of total RNA was annealed to a poly(dT) primer (Promega) at 65 °C and reversibly transcribed into cDNA by SuperScript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) in 20 μl at 42 °C for 30 min. Three μl of the reaction of cell lines, 2 μl of cultured neurons, or 1 μl of brain tissues was used in a PCR to detect NR2A mRNA with human primers, GB509 (5′-TGATGAGGGAACCTCTTTGG)/GB510 (5′-GGTTGCTCTTCTCCATCAGC), rat primers, GB508 (5′-TGTGAAGAAATGCTGCAAGG)/GB511 (5′-GAACGCTCCTCATTGATGGT), or mouse primers, GB512 (5′-CCATCAGCAGGGGCATCTACAG)/GB513 (5′-ACTGTGTTGGGGTTGGACTCAT). Primers of GB450 (5′-ACCACAGTCCATGCCATCAC) and GB449 (5′-TCCACCACCCTGTTGCTGTA) were used to detect the glyceraldehydes-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) mRNA from human, rat, and mouse. To detect reporter gene mRNAs, primers GB149 (5′-GCGGTTGCAAAACGCTTCCATCTTCCAGGGATAC)/GB148 (5′-AAATAGGATCTCTGGCATGCGAGAATCTGACGCAG) were used for luciferase transcripts and GB122 (5′-ATGTGCGGCGAGTTGCGTGACTACCTA)/GB123 (5′-ATTCATTGGCACCATGCCGTGGGTTTC) for Escherichia coli β-galactosidase. PCR was performed with Ex Taq DNA polymerase and cycled with annealing temperatures between 50 and 60 °C and extension at 72 °C for 45 s. 40 cycles were used for NR2A mRNA, 30 cycles for luciferase mRNA, and 26 cycles for β-galactosidase. DNA products were visualized with UV illumination on agarose gel containing 10 μg/ml ethidium bromide. Images were taken on a Kodak Image Station 440CF and analyzed with 1D Image Analysis software as stated previously (39Liu A. Prenger M.S. Norton D.D. Mei L. Kusiak J.W. Bai G. J. Biol.

Kusiak J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7737-7744Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). DNA sequences used as probes in electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA) are as follows: GC-box-a, 5′-GCCTCCGGGGTGGGCGACTGC; GC-box-b, 5′-CCGGGGAGCGGGCGGAGAGCGTGGT; GC-Box-c, 5′-GCATCCTGGGCGGGTGTGTGC. Probes were labeled by T4 DNA kinase in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP (ICN Biomedicals), and EMSA was conducted in a method reported previously (37Bai G. Kusiak J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7737-7744Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Competition and supershift of EMSA were performed as described previously with antibodies against Sp1, Sp3, or Sp4 (37Bai G. Kusiak J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7737-7744Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). A consensus of GC-Box (Sp1 site) from Promega was used as a competitor. Results of EMSA were analyzed and quantified with a PhosphorImager as described in our previous studies (41Bai G. Norton D.D. Prenger M.S. Kusiak J.W. J. Biol.

Kusiak J.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1152: 197-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). To prepare a probe for library screening, we chose a sequence near the 5′-end of the NR2A cDNA (GenBank™ M91561). To avoid skipping intronic sequences in a probe derived from cDNA and hence having a mismatch between the probe and the genomic clones, we conducted PCR on genomic DNA with primers surrounding the chosen sequence. This guaranteed a probe that exactly matched the genomic sequences. A 1.8-kb product, termed GB5498, wa"

Intriguingly, mutated Met requires ligand stimulation in order to unleash its transforming potential. Furthermore, individuals bearing a germ line met mutation develop cancer only late in life and with incomplete penetrance. To date, there is no molecular explanation for this unique behavior, which is unusual for a dominant oncogene. Here we investigate the molecular mechanisms underlying met oncogenic conversion by generating antibodies specific for the differently phosphorylated forms of the Met protein. Using these antibodies, we show that activation of wild-type Met is achieved through sequential phosphorylation of Tyr1235 and Tyr1234 in the activation loop and that mutagenesis of either tyrosine dramatically impairs kinase function. Surprisingly, oncogenic Met mutants never become phosphorylated on Tyr1234 despite their high enzymatic activity, and mutagenesis of Tyr1234 does not affect their biochemical or biological function. By analyzing the enzymatic properties of the mutant proteins in different conditions, we demonstrate that oncogenic mutations do not elicit constitutive kinase activation but simply overcome the requirement for the second phosphorylation step, thus reducing the threshold for activation. In the presence of activating signals, these mutations result therefore in a dynamic imbalance toward the active conformation of the kinase. This explains why mutant met provides an oncogenic predisposition but needs a second activating “hit,” provided by sustained ligand stimulation or receptor overexpression, to achieve a fully transformed phenotype.

Mutant Met has been shown to display deregulated kinase activity to transform mouse fibroblast and to be tumorigenic in nude mice (14Jeffers M. Schmidt L. Nakaigawa N. Webb C.P. Weirich G. Kishida T.

Interestingly, although the mutant forms of Met possess an intrinsic higher kinase activity in vitro, their transforming ability in vivo is latent and can be unmasked only in the presence of HGF (16Michieli P.

All together, these observations indicate that a met mutation provides tumor predisposition, but increased dosage and/or sustained ligand stimulation is required to actually determine tumor formation. To date, there is no molecular explanation for this unique biological behavior, which is unusual for a dominant oncogene. From a biochemical viewpoint, receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) are nothing but allosteric enzymes that may exist in an inactive and an active conformation. The transition from the inactive to the active state is regulated by both cis-autoinhibition and trans-autophosphorylation. In the inactive form, access of substrate or substrate and ATP to the catalytic site is prevented by a “closed” conformation of the activation loop (A-loop), a structurally conserved mobile segment containing key regulatory tyrosines that blocks substrate access to the catalytic niche but cannot be cis-phosphorylated because of steric hindrance. Upon ligand-induced stabilization of receptor homodimers, trans-phosphorylation of the A-loop by a neighboring protomer mediates destabilization of the closed A-loop conformation, thus removing autoinhibition and allowing for kinase activation (19Hubbard S.R. Mohammadi M. Schlessinger J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11987-11990Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar, 20Weiss A. Schlessinger J. Cell. 1998; 94: 277-280Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). In the case of Met, the A-loop contains two neighbor tyrosines, Tyr1234 and Tyr1235, that represent the major phosphorylation site of the receptor and are essential for the catalytic activity of the kinase. Substitution of either tyrosine with phenylalanine severely impairs wild-type kinase function (21Longati P. Bardelli A. Ponzetto C. Naldini L. Comoglio P.M. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 49-57PubMed Google Scholar, 22Rodrigues G.A. Park M. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 2019-2027PubMed Google Scholar). In this study, we investigate the molecular mechanisms underlying oncogenic conversion of Met by an immunological approach. To study the function of Tyr1234 and Tyr1235 in wild-type and mutant Met regulation, we developed antibodies specific for the differently phosphorylated forms of the Met A-loop. We provide evidence that three different transforming Met mutants, D1228H, D1228N, and M1250T, found in both hereditary and sporadic human tumors are surprisingly not phosphorylated on Tyr1234 despite their high kinase activity. By site-directed mutagenesis, we demonstrate that phosphorylation of Tyr1234 is dispensable for mutant Met biochemical and biological activity and that phosphorylation of Tyr1235 alone is sufficient to activate the mutant kinase. Consistent with this observation, the activation of mutant Met by autophosphorylation occurs faster compared with wild-type Met, and if the proteins get preactivated with ATP before the assay, the kinase activity of wild-type Met becomes comparable with that of mutant Met. Importantly, mutant Met displays increased tyrosine phosphorylation in vivo only if its ability to interact with HGF is preserved. These data suggest that oncogenic mutations in the met gene do not activate the kinase per se but simply lower the threshold for activation, explaining why a “second hit” is required by mutant Met to unleash its oncogenic potential. Generation of Anti-phospho-A-loop Antibodies—Polyclonal antibodies were generated against the following synthetic peptides corresponding to amino acids 1229–1242 of human Met: peptide-AL, MYDKEYYSVHNKTG; peptide-AL-pTyr1234, MYDKEpYYSVHNKTG; and peptide-AL-pTyr1235, MYDKEYpYSVHNKTG. New Zealand White rabbits were immunized with peptides as described previously (23Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory. Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988Google Scholar). Sera of immunized animals were purified by four consecutive steps of affinity chromatography as follows. In the first step, total immunoglobulins were purified using a Sepharose-protein A column (Amersham Biosciences) and eluted with 50 mm glycine, pH 2.7. Following neutralization with Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and dialysis against phosphate-buffered saline, immunoglobulins (second step) were deprived of antibodies against non-phosphorylated A-loop by adsorption on a column of immobilized peptide-AL. The flow-through from step 2 was dialyzed against phosphate-buffered saline and then deprived of general anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies (step 3) using a column of phosphotyrosine-agarose (Sigma). In the last step, the flow-through from step 3 was applied to a column containing the phosphopeptide used for immunization and anti-phospho-A-loop-antibodies were purified by affinity. For purification of antibodies against non-phosphorylated A-loop, immunoglobulins from step 1 were applied directly onto a column of immobilized peptide-AL, purified by affinity, and then deprived of general anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies as described in step 3. Peptides were coupled to Affi-Gel 10 (Bio-Rad) at a density of 2.5 mg/ml according to the manufacturer's instructions. All of the antibodies were eluted from peptide columns with 50 mm glycine, pH 2.7, and immediately neutralized with Tris-HCl, pH 8.0. Purified antibodies were dialyzed against phosphate-buffered saline containing 10% glycerol and stored at –80 °C.

Cell. 1996; 7: 495-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar) were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Sigma). A549 lung carcinoma cells (ATCC) and GTL16 cells (26Giordano S. Di Renzo M.F. Ferracini R. Chiado-Piat L. Comoglio P.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 3510-3517Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium plus 10% fetal bovine serum. NIH3T3 mouse fibroblasts were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium plus 10% calf serum (Colorado Serum Co., Denver, CO). Transient transfection of COS cells and stable transfection of MLP29 cells were performed using Lipofectin reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Focus formation assays were performed as described previously (16Michieli P. Basilico C. Pennacchietti S. Maffé A. Tamagnone L. Giordano S. Bardelli A. Comoglio P.M. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 5221-5231Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Cells (1.5 × 105 cells/100-mm plate) were transfected with the appropriate pCEV plasmid (10 μg/plate) by the calcium-phosphate method in the presence of 10% calf serum. After 24 h, serum concentration was reduced to 5% and cells were cultured for an additional 14 days. Foci were scored following staining with Giemsa dye. HGF stimulation was performed on serum-starved MLP29 cells for 10 min at 37 °C using 100 ng/ml bacu-lovirus-produced human recombinant HGF. Western Blot Analysis—Protein extracts were obtained by lysing cells in EB buffer (100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol) in the presence of 1 mm sodium orthovanadate and a mixture of protease inhibitors (pepstatin, leupeptin, aprotinin, soybean trypsin inhibitor, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Extracts were clarified by centrifugation, and protein concentration was determined using a BCA protein assay reagent kit (Pierce). Equal amounts of total protein extract (1 mg) were immunoprecipitated using anti-Met monoclonal antibodies (DQ-13) (27Ruco L.P. Ranalli T. Marzullo A. Bianco P. Prat M. Comoglio P.M. Baroni C.D. J. Pathol. 1996; 180: 266-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) adsorbed on Sepharose-protein A beads (Amersham Biosciences) using rabbit anti-mouse immunoglobulins (Pierce). Immunoprecipitated proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by Western blotting using the appropriate anti-A-loop antibodies, anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies (UBI, Lake Placid, NY), anti-Met polyclonal antibodies (C-12, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), or anti-epidermal growth factor receptor antibodies (BD Transduction Laboratories, San Diego, CA). Bound antibodies were detected using the appropriate peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies and an ECL kit (both from Amersham Biosciences). Quantification of ECL signal was performed using a STORM apparatus with ImageQuant software (Amersham Biosciences). Kinase Assays—For autokinase assays, the various Met proteins were produced by transient transfection in COS cells, extracted with EB buffer in the absence of orthovanadate, and then immunoprecipitated with anti-Met antibodies as described above. Immunoprecipitated proteins were washed in dephosphorylation buffer (100 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 10 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm ZnCl2, 100 mm NaCl, 0.2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin) and dephosphorylated using purified shrimp alkaline phosphatase (2 units/50 μl, Promega, Madison, WI) for1hat16 °C. Dephosphorylated proteins were then washed five times with kinase buffer (25 mm HEPES, pH 7.1, 5 mm MgCl2, 100 mm NaCl). The phosphorylation reaction was performed in 50 μl of kinase buffer containing [γ-32P]ATP (5 Ci/sample) and 10 μm unlabeled ATP for the indicated times at room temperature. The reaction was stopped by the addition of boiling Laemmli buffer. Samples were resolved by SDS-PAGE on a 8% polyacrylamide gel and then transferred to a Hybond nitrocellulose membrane (Amersham Biosciences). The radioactive filter was analyzed by autoradiography and quantified using a STORM apparatus with Image-Quant software. After autoradiography, the membrane was analyzed by Western blot using anti-Met polyclonal antibodies as described above and kinase activity was normalized on Met protein amount. For exogenous substrate kinase assays, the various Met proteins were prepared and dephosphorylated as described above. The kinase reaction was performed by incubating immunoprecipitated proteins with increasing concentrations of myelin basic protein (Sigma) in kinase buffer containing 10 mm unlabeled ATP and [γ-32P]ATP (5 Ci/sample) for 15 min at 4 °C. The reaction was blocked by the addition of reducing Laemmli buffer containing 10 mm EDTA. Samples were resolved by SDS-PAGE on a 8–12% gradient polyacrylamide gel. Following electrophoresis, the lower portion of the gel containing myelin basic protein was cut, dried, and analyzed by autoradiography. The upper portion of the gel containing the Met protein was transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane, analyzed by Western blot using anti-Met antibodies, and quantified as described above. Myelin basic protein phosphorylation was quantified using a STORM apparatus as described above, and values were normalized on Met protein levels. For preactivation experiments, immunoprecipitated Met proteins were incubated in kinase buffer containing 40 mm unlabeled ATP for 2 h at room temperature. Sequential Phosphorylation of Tyr1235 and Tyr1234—To determine the phosphorylation kinetic Tyr1234 and Tyr1235, wild-type Met protein was prepared and dephosphorylated as described above. Dephosphorylated Met was subjected to an autophosphorylation reaction in kinase buffer containing 0.1 μm unlabeled ATP on ice and for the indicated times. The reaction was stopped by the addition of boiling Laemmli buffer. Samples were resolved by SDS-PAGE on a 8% polyacrylamide gel, transferred to a Hybond nitrocellulose membrane, and then analyzed by Western blot using anti-AL-pTyr1234, anti-AL-pTyr1235 antibodies, or anti-Met antibodies as described above. Generation of Anti-phospho-A-loop Antibodies—To gain new insights into the mechanism of Met regulation, we generated antibodies against three different synthetic peptides corresponding to amino acids 1229–1242 of the Met A-loop. Each peptide had a distinct pattern of tyrosine phosphorylation: peptide-AL (not phosphorylated); peptide-AL-pTyr1234 (phosphorylated Tyr1234); and peptide-AL-pTyr1235 (phosphorylated Tyr1235). New Zealand White rabbits were immunized with the different peptides, and immunoglobulins from positive bleeds were purified by repeated affinity steps as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The immunospecificity of purified antibodies was analyzed by Western blotting using COS cells transiently expressing wild-type Met as well as mutant forms of Met lacking Tyr1234, Tyr1235, or both. Because of very high levels of expression, exogenous RTKs produced in this system undergo spontaneous clusterization and trans-autophosphorylation. As shown in Fig. 1, left panel, anti-AL antibodies recognized the Met protein regardless of its phosphorylation status. In contrast, anti-AL-pTyr1234 and anti-AL-pTyr1235 antibodies were immunoreactive only with Met proteins containing a phosphorylated tyrosine in positions 1234 and 1235, respectively. In GTL16 gastric carcinoma cells that overexpress both Met and epidermal growth factor receptor, all of the antibodies were specific for Met (central panel). Immunoreactivity with Met was also observed in A549 lung adenocarcinoma cells that express moderate levels of receptor and therefore require ligand stimulation for Met autophosphorylation (right panel). It can be concluded that the generated antibodies can specifically discriminate among differently phosphorylated forms of the Met A-loop. Oncogenic Forms of Met Are Not Phosphorylated on Tyr1234—To shed light onto the molecular mechanisms underlying oncogenic conversion of Met, we analyzed the phosphorylation status of three representative mutant forms of Met commonly found in both hereditary and sporadic human tumors: D1228H Met, D1228N Met, and M1250T Met (11Schmidt L. Junker K. Nakaigawa N. et al.Oncogene. 1999; 18: 2343-2350Crossref PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar, 12Park W.S. Dong S.M. Kim S.Y. et al.Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 307-310PubMed Google Scholar). COS cells transiently expressing wild-type or mutant Met were analyzed by Western blotting as described above. Remarkably, this analysis revealed that all of the mutants analyzed are not phosphorylated on Tyr1234 (Fig. 2, COS panel). This is surprising because, as already stated, phosphorylation of both Tyr1234 and Tyr1235 is an absolute requirement for activation of the Met kinase (21Longati P. Bardelli A. Ponzetto C. Naldini L. Comoglio P.M. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 49-57PubMed Google Scholar, 22Rodrigues G.A. Park M. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 2019-2027PubMed Google Scholar). Failure of the antibodies to recognize the mutant proteins cannot be the result of conformational changes of the kinase, because the immunoblotting procedure involves the boiling of samples in ionic detergent plus reducing agent and electrophoresis in denaturing conditions. Furthermore, the lack of Tyr1234 phosphorylation in mutant Met is not an artifact due to overexpression in COS cells, because epithelial cells (MLP29) stably expressing moderate levels of Met display the same pattern of immunoreactivity upon ligand stimulation (Fig. 2, MLP29 panel). Because the D1228H, D1228N, and M1250T Met mutants possess high catalytic and transforming activity (15Bardelli A. Longati P. Gramaglia D. Basilico C. Tamagnone L. Giordano S. Ballinari D. Michieli P. Comoglio P.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 14379-14383Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 16Michieli P. Basilico C. Pennacchietti S. Maffé A. Tamagnone L.

Candidus S. Lubensky I.A. Linehan W.M. Zbar B. Weirich G. Nat. Genet. 1998; 19: 66-69Crossref Scopus (269) Google Scholar), these data suggest that phosphorylation of Tyr1234 is dispensable for their function. Oncogenic Mutations Overcome the Requirement for Tyr1234 Phosphorylation—To test this hypothesis, we mutagenized Tyr1234, Tyr1235, or both to phenylalanine in wild-type or mutant Met and analyzed kinase activity of the engineered receptors in both autophosphorylation assays (Fig. 3A) and kinase assays using an exogenous substrate (Fig. 3B). Because the D1228H and D1228N behaved similarly in all of the analyses performed, only the results relative to D1228H will be shown hereafter. As previously reported (21Longati P. Bardelli A. Ponzetto C. Naldini L. Comoglio P.M. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 49-57PubMed Google Scholar, 22Rodrigues G.A. Park M. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 2019-2027PubMed Google Scholar), wild-type Met activity strongly relied on the presence of both tyrosines. In contrast, the kinase activity of D1228H Met and M1250T Met was not affected by the Y1234F substitution. Unexpectedly, also the Y1235F substitution did not reduce mutant kinase activity in the presence of Tyr1234. However, this is easily explained by reciprocal compensating phosphorylation of the two neighbor tyrosines. In fact, Tyr1234 becomes phosphorylated in mutant Met when Tyr1235 is missing (Fig. 4). In any case, kinase activity of both D1228H Met and M1250T Met decreased dramatically upon mutagenesis of both Tyr1234 and Tyr1235 to phenylalanine, indicating that mutant Met requires at least one of the two tyrosines for function. This was also observed in biological assays aimed at measuring the transforming activity of the mutant Met proteins. NIH3T3 cells, which produce HGF (see Refs. 16Michieli P. Basilico C.

A. 1997; 94: 11445-11450Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar), were transfected with plasmids encoding for wild-type or mutant Met, and the number of transformed foci was determined after 2 weeks. As shown in Table I, the transforming ability of D1228H Met and M1250T Met was not affected by a single tyrosine substitution but severely impaired by mutagenesis of both Tyr1234 and Tyr1235. Therefore, oncogenic mutations in the kinase domain of Met overcome the requirement of phosphorylation of one but not two key tyrosine residue in the A-loop.Fig. 4Tyr1234 becomes phosphorylated in mutant Met when Tyr1235 is missing.

This would predict that mutant forms of Met become activated more easily and earlier than wild-type Met. This was tested by an autophosphorylation time-course experiment in which receptors are forced to homodimerize by a specific antibody (21Longati P. Bardelli A. Ponzetto C. Naldini L. Comoglio P.M. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 49-57PubMed Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitated wild-type or mutant Met was accurately dephosphorylated to increase molecular homogeneity and then incubated with saturating concentrations of [32P]ATP for different times. The extent of autophosphorylation was determined by SDS-PAGE followed by autoradiography and quantified as described under “Experimental Procedures.” As Fig. 5A shows, M1250T Met and D1228H Met autophosphorylated at a substantially higher rate compared with wild-type Met. However, autophosphorylation eventually reached saturation, and in the long term (∼2 h), all of the receptors were phosphorylated to the same extent. Because intrinsic kinase activity of mutant versus wild-type Met is normally measured using unphosphorylated receptors and an exogenous substrate (see Fig. 3B) (14Jeffers M. Schmidt L. Nakaigawa N. Webb C.P. Weirich G. Kishida T. Zbar B. Vande Woude G.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 11445-11450Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar, 15Bardelli A. Longati P. Gramaglia D.

Ponzetto C. Naldini L. Comoglio P.M. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 49-57PubMed Google Scholar), these data would be compatible with a scenario in which oncogenic forms of Met display higher kinase activity because they reach complete activation before wild-type Met. To test this hypothesis, a kinase assay was performed in parallel using (a) dephosphorylated Met or (b) preactivated Met (obtained by preincubating the immunoprecipitated receptors with ATP for 2 h). In accordance with the mechanism hypothesized, receptor preactivation using ATP completely abrogated the biochemical advantage of mutant Met over wild-type Met (Fig. 5B). All together, these data suggest that oncogenic mutations do not elicit constitutive activation of the Met kinase but rather decrease the threshold for kinase activation. Increased Autophosphorylation Occurs in the Presence of Stimulating Signals Only—These results prompted us to test whether oncogenic mutations per se would result in increased receptor autophosphorylation in the context of a non-overexpressing cell system. Recombinant Met receptors were engineered to contain both an oncogenic mutation (D1228H or M1250T) and a deletion in the HGF-interacting domain in the extracellular portion of the molecule (16Michieli P. Basilico C. Pennacchietti S. Maffé A. Tamagnone L. Giordano S. Bardelli A. Comoglio P.M. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 5221-5231Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). NIH3T3 cells stably expressing the engineered receptors (ΔMet) or the corresponding unmodified receptors (Met) were analyzed by Western blotting using anti-phospho-A-loop antibodies to determine Met activation. Fig. 6 shows the results of this analysis. Remarkably, the mutant forms of Met displayed increased A-loop phosphorylation compared with wild-type Met only when their ability to interact with endogenous HGF was preserved. All of the ΔMet receptors showed the same low levels of A-loop phosphorylation regardless of their genetic status. This cannot be due to the lack of membrane exposure or kinase inactivation in the ΔMet proteins, because these engineered receptors have been shown to be properly exposed at the cell surface, to respond to ligand-mimetic antibodies directed against the extracellular portion of the Met β-chain, and to be completely functional in kinase assays (16Michieli P. Basilico C. Pennacchietti S. Maffé A. Tamagnone L. Giordano S. Bardelli A. Comoglio P.M. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 5221-5231Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Furthermore, ΔMet receptors containing the D1228H or M1250T mutation failed to transform NIH3T3 fibroblasts (Table I). Therefore, consistent with the data showed in Fig. 2, MLP29 panel, and the results obtained in kinase assays, oncogenic mutations result in increased autophosphorylation and acquisition of transforming ability only in the presence of activating signals. Sequential Phosphorylation of Tyr1235 and Tyr1234—Yet still the “independency” of mutant Met kinase from Tyr1234 phosphorylation does not explain the lack of Tyr1234 phosphorylation. This lack of phosphorylation probably reflects a different spatial orientation of the two A-loop tyrosines within the catalytic niche. Molecular modeling analysis of the Met A-loop revealed that the mean solvent-accessible surface of Tyr1235 is significantly higher than that of Tyr1234 (data not shown), suggesting that upon receptor dimerization, Tyr1235 is trans-phosphorylated before Tyr1234. This was tested in an autophosphorylation experiment performed in controlled conditions. Dephosphorylated wild-type Met was incubated with a limiting concentration of ATP to slow down the autocatalytic reaction. Autokinase activity was stopped at increasing time points, and the extent of Tyr1234/Tyr1235 phosphorylation was determined by Western blotting using anti-AL-pTyr1234 and anti-AL-pTyr1235 antibodies. As shown in Fig. 7, the phosphorylation of Tyr1235 appeared first and then proceeded at approximately a 2-fold higher rate compared with Tyr1234 phosphorylation. This is consistent with a higher accessibility of Tyr1235 and confirms our hypothesis that, during kinase trans-activation, Tyr1235 is statistically phosphorylated before Tyr1234. In this study, we generated antibodies specific for the differently phosphorylated forms of the Met A-loop. Using these antibodies, we were able to show that activation of wild-type Met proceeds through the sequential phosphorylation of Tyr1235 and Tyr1234 and that oncogenic mutant forms of Met found in human cancer fail to be phosphorylated on Tyr1234 despite their high kinase activity. Biochemical and biological assays aimed at measuring the activity of wild-type and mutant Met revealed that oncogenic amino acid substitutions in the Met kinase overcome the requirement for phosphorylation of one of the two A-loop tyrosines, thus suggesting that a mutant receptor has a lower threshold for activation compared with wild-type Met. From a biochemical viewpoint, the observation that Tyr1235 is phosphorylated before Tyr1234 helps to explain why mutant Met is not phosphorylated on Tyr1234. When two receptors meet at the cell surface, trans-phosphorylation may occur if their interaction is stable enough. The most exposed tyrosine (i.e. Tyr1235) has the higher chance to become a substrate of the adjacent receptor, but its phosphorylation is not sufficient to release autoinhibition in wild-type Met. Kinase activation is not achieved until a second phosphorylation event occurs on Tyr1234. Once both tyrosines have been phosphorylated, the A-loop loosens its interactions with the kinase body, assuming an open conformation. At this point, the kinase domain undergoes a major conformational change and the catalytic niche becomes accessible to the next functional substrate of the activated kinase, conceivably the receptor tail containing the unique docking “super-site” (28Ponzetto C. Bardelli A. Zhen Z. Maina F. dalla Zonca P. Giordano S. Graziani A. Panayotou G. Comoglio P.M. Cell. 1994; 77: 261-271Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (898) Google Scholar). This dual switch control system may have evolved to ensure a tight regulation of the Met kinase, a protein mastering vital biological processes in physiological conditions but leading to neoplasia when inappropriately activated. Oncogenic mutations subvert this control system not by directly activating the kinase but by overcoming the requirement for the second phosphorylation step. Therefore, in a mutant receptor, the phosphorylation of Tyr1235 is sufficient to remove A-loop-mediated autoinhibition and to elicit kinase activation. Once the enzyme is in the active state, the open conformation of the A-loop and the accessibility of the catalytic site to the many substrates of the Met signal transduction cascade may prevent phosphorylation of Tyr1234, which is no longer necessary in any case. The notion that an oncogenic Met does not represent a constitutively active kinase but rather a deregulated enzyme that gets more easily activated is central to explain the unique biological features of mutant Met-driven tumorigenesis. In living cells, RTKs are subjected to opposite stimuli aimed at activating the kinase on one hand and at controlling its activity on the other hand by feedback mechanisms. In these conditions, an amino acid substitution lowering the threshold for activation will certainly result in a net shift toward the active form. However, as supported by our results, this will manifest only in the presence of positive stimuli and, in fact, mutant Met can display its oncogenic potential only upon stimulation with HGF (16Michieli P. Basilico C. Pennacchietti S. Maffé A. Tamagnone L. Giordano S. Bardelli A. Comoglio P.M. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 5221-5231Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). In vivo, mutations in the met gene do not elicit a dramatic tumorigenic effect per se but clearly “prime” the affected individual or tissue to the development of cancer (10Schmidt L. Duh F.M. Chen F. et al.Nat. Genet. 1997; 16: 68-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (1332) Google Scholar, 11Schmidt L. Junker K.

Interestingly, individuals harboring a germ line met mutation develop mainly renal tumors despite the ubiquitous expression of the mutant gene (10Schmidt L. Duh F.M. Chen F. et al.Nat. Genet. 1997; 16: 68-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (1332) Google Scholar). HGF is present in the human body mostly in the form of inactive precursor (pro-HGF) that is converted to an active factor upon local up-regulation of specific pro-HGF convertases (29Gak E. Taylor W.G. Chan A.M. Rubin J.S. FEBS Lett. 1992; 311: 17-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). One of the most characterized pro-HGF convertases is urokinase (30Naldini L. Tamagnone L. Vigna E. Sachs M. Hartmann G. Birchmeier W. Daikuhara Y. Tsubouchi H. Blasi F. Comoglio P.M. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 4825-4833Crossref PubMed Scopus (525) Google Scholar), which is produced mainly if not solely by the kidney epithelium. All together, these observations suggest that active HGF is still an in vivo limiting factor for mutant Met-driven tumorigenesis and our data provide a molecular explanation for it. The dual switch mechanism described in this work is similar in principle but symmetric de facto to Knudson's model for tumor suppressor gene inactivation (31Knudson A.G. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1986; 20: 231-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). Indeed, in both cases two events have to accumulate before the aberrant phenotype is expressed. From a functional viewpoint, there is some homology between a “double loss of function” required for tumor suppressor gene inactivation and a “double removal of autoinhibitory signals” required for Met activation. In both systems, one event is provided genetically and the second is provided somatically, and this may explain some of the clinical features associated with mutant met that are unusual for a dominant oncogene. For example, long latency and incomplete penetrance usually reflect the requirement for loss of heterozygosity. In the case of met, it could be more appropriate to speak about “gain of homozygosity,” because duplication of the chromosome bearing the mutant met allele is invariably selected during tumor progression (17Zhuang Z. Park W.S. Pack S. Schmidt L. Vortmeyer A.O. Pak E. Pham T. Weil R.J. Candidus S. Lubensky I.A. Linehan W.M. Zbar B. Weirich G. Nat.

Oncogene. 1998; 17: 733-739Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). This leads to both higher expression of the mutant protein and increased autocrine stimulation because HGF and met lie both on chromosome 7 (this is a peculiarity not shared by other oncogenic RTKs). This unique biologic scenario finds a molecular explanation in the results presented here, which depict mutant Met dormant in a semi-activated state, waiting for a “wake” signal to unleash its oncogenic and transforming potential.

Stephen Harrison, Luigi Naldini, Carola Ponzetto, and Philippe Gual for helpful discussion and Raffaella Albano, Laura Palmas, Francesca Grasso, and Solange Tienga for skilled technical assistance."
https://openalex.org/W1980937298,"We have previously shown that Nkx3.2, a member of the NK class of homeoproteins, functions as a transcriptional repressor to promote somitic chondrogenesis. However, it has not been addressed whether Nkx3.2 can bind to DNA in a sequence-specific manner and whether DNA binding by Nkx3.2 is required for its biological activity. In this work, we employed a DNA binding site selection assay, which identified TAAGTG as a high affinity Nkx3.2 binding sequence. Sequence-specific binding of Nkx3.2 to the TAAGTG motif in vitro was confirmed by electrophoretic mobility shift assays, and mutagenesis of this sequence revealed that HRAGTG (where H represents A, C, or T, and R represents A or G) comprises the consensus DNA binding site for Nkx3.2. Consistent with these findings, the expression of a reporter gene containing reiterated Nkx3.2 binding sites was repressed in vivo by Nkx3.2 co-expression. In addition, we have generated a DNA nonbinding point mutant of Nkx3.2 (Nkx3.2-N200Q), which contains an asparagine to glutamine missense mutation in the homeodomain. Interestingly, despite being defective in DNA binding, Nkx3.2-N200Q still retains its intrinsic transcriptional repressor function. Finally, we demonstrate that unlike wild-type Nkx3.2, Nkx3.2-N200Q is unable to activate the chondrocyte differentiation program in somitic mesoderm, indicating that DNA binding by Nkx3.2 is critical for this factor to induce somitic chondrogenesis. We have previously shown that Nkx3.2, a member of the NK class of homeoproteins, functions as a transcriptional repressor to promote somitic chondrogenesis.

In addition, we have generated a DNA nonbinding point mutant of Nkx3.2 (Nkx3.2-N200Q), which contains an asparagine to glutamine missense mutation in the homeodomain. Interestingly, despite being defective in DNA binding, Nkx3.2-N200Q still retains its intrinsic transcriptional repressor function. Finally, we demonstrate that unlike wild-type Nkx3.2, Nkx3.2-N200Q is unable to activate the chondrocyte differentiation program in somitic mesoderm, indicating that DNA binding by Nkx3.2 is critical for this factor to induce somitic chondrogenesis. Endochondral ossification, which accounts for the majority of vertebrate skeletal formation, begins with chondrogenesis, in which a cartilaginous template is established prior to replacement by mature bone tissue (1Huang R. Zhi Q. Schmidt C. Wilting J. Brand-Saberi B. Christ B. Development. 2000; 127: 527-532PubMed Google Scholar). The cartilage of the axial skeleton originates from somites, paired blocks of mesodermal tissue symmetrically flanking the central vertebrate axis (1Huang R. Zhi Q. Schmidt C. Wilting J. Brand-Saberi B. Christ B. Development. 2000; 127: 527-532PubMed Google Scholar). Whereas the dorsal domain of each somite, the dermomyotome, is a progenitor tissue for skeletal muscle and dermis, the ventral domain of the somite, the sclerotome, differentiates into the cartilage template of the vertebrae and ribs (2Hirsinger E. Jouve C. Dubrulle J. Pourquie O. Int. Rev. Cytol. 2000; 198: 1-65Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3Stockdale F.E. Nikovits Jr., W. Christ B. Dev. Dyn. 2000; 219: 304-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Signals from the notochord are crucial for the induction of the sclerotome and subsequent formation of axial cartilage (4Dockter J.L. Curr. Top. Dev. Biol. 2000; 48: 77-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar).

Development. 1998; 125: 2019-2030PubMed Google Scholar). In addition to Shh, bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) also play an important role in axial cartilage differentiation (8Zeng L. Kempf H.

Nohno T. Development. 1996; 122: 3557-3566Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, it is currently unclear how BMP signal transduction pathways act to promote somitic chondrogenesis. Nkx3.2, the vertebrate homologue of Drosophila bagpipe (NK3), is a member of the NK family of homeoproteins, which have been shown to be involved in cell fate specification and the differentiation of various organs (12Kim Y. Nirenberg M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 7716-7720Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar, 13Harvey R.P. Dev. Biol. 1996; 178: 203-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar). Nkx3.2 is initially expressed in the sclerotomal portion of the somites, and its expression is maintained in developing cartilage (14Tribioli C. Frasch M. Lufkin T. Mech. Dev. 1997; 65: 145-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Nkx3.2-deficient mice lack the ventral medial region of their vertebrae (15Tribioli C. Lufkin T. Development. 1999; 126: 5699-5711Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16Lettice L.A. Purdie L.A. Carlson G.J. Kilanowski F. Dorin J. Hill R.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Genes Cells. 2000; 5: 499-513Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), indicating a crucial role for this transcription factor to promote somitic chondrogenesis. We have previously shown that Shh signals can induce expression of Nkx3.2 in paraxial mesoderm and that forced expression of Nkx3.2 can activate somitic chondrogenesis in the absence of Shh signals (8Zeng L. Kempf H. Murtaugh L.C. Sato M.E. Lassar A.B. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 1990-2005Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar, 10Murtaugh L.C. Zeng L. Chyung J.H. Lassar A.B. Dev. Cell. 2001; 1: 411-422Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Our prior findings also indicate that induction of chondrogenesis by Nkx3.2 requires both its transcriptional repressor activity and the presence of BMP signals (10Murtaugh L.C. Zeng L. Chyung J.H. Lassar A.B. Dev. Cell. 2001; 1: 411-422Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). However, it has not been examined whether Nkx3.2 can bind to a specific DNA sequence(s) and, more importantly, whether the DNA binding activity of Nkx3.2 is required for its biological function. In this work, using a binding site selection assay, we both identify a high affinity DNA binding sequence for Nkx3.2 and determine the consensus DNA binding site for this transcription factor. Furthermore, we demonstrate that Nkx3.2 can bind to DNA in a sequence-specific manner both in vitro and in vivo and that the DNA binding activity of Nkx3.2 is essential for this factor to promote somitic chondrogenesis.

Plasmids and Molecular Cloning—To generate the pGEX-Nkx3.2-HA bacterial expression construct, the C-terminal HA-tagged Nkx3.2 insert in SLAX13 (10Murtaugh L.C. Zeng L. Chyung J.H. Lassar A.B. Dev. Cell. 2001; 1: 411-422Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar) was liberated with NcoI and XbaI and cloned into pGEX-NcoI, which contains an engineered NcoI site between the BamHI and EcoRI sites of pGEX-2TK (Amersham Biosciences). To create pCS2-Nkx3.2 and pCS2-Nkx3.2-VP16, the respective inserts in SLAX13 (10Murtaugh L.C. Zeng L. Chyung J.H. Lassar A.B. Dev. Cell. 2001; 1: 411-422Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 18Riddle R.D. Johnson R.L. Laufer E. Tabin C.

To construct the NBE, NBE-m1, and NBE-m2 reporters, the respective double-stranded oligonucleotides (see “Oligonucleotides” for sequences) were digested with KpnI and MluI and cloned into pGL3P (Promega). Nkx3.2-N200Q cDNA was generated by in vitro PCR mutagenesis using primers described under “Oligonucleotides,” and the PCR product was digested with NcoI to generate a 5′ overhang and ligated into a linearized SLAX13 shuttle vector with 3′ NcoI and 5′ SmaI overhangs. For pGEX-Nkx3.2-N200Q and pCS2-Nkx3.2-N200Q, the inserts were liberated from SLAX13-Nkx3.2-N200Q and cloned into pGEX-NcoI or pCS2 exactly as described above for wild-type Nkx3.2. A GAL4-DBD empty vector, pSG424 (19Sadowski I. Ptashne M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 7539Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar), GAL4-Nkx3.2 expression plasmid (10Murtaugh L.C. Zeng L.

Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 4707-4717Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) have been previously described. To construct GAL4-Nkx3.2-N200Q, the Nkx3.2-N200Q insert in SLAX13 was liberated with a 5′ Klenow-filled NcoI site and a 3′ XbaI overhang and ligated into a linearized pSG424 empty vector with SmaI and XbaI. To generate RCAS(A)-Nkx3.2-N200Q, the Nkx3.2-N200Q insert in SLAX13 was transferred as a ClaI fragment into RCAS(A) (21Hughes S.H. Greenhouse J.J. Petropoulos C.J. Sutrave P. J. Virol. 1987; 61: 3004-3012Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). All constructs newly generated in this work were verified by DNA sequencing. CAST—Recombinant GST-Nkx3.2-HA protein was bacterially expressed and affinity-purified using glutathione-agarose beads following the manufacturer's instructions provided by Amersham Biosciences. The affinity-purified GST-Nkx3.2-HA protein was then immunopurified by anti-HA immunoprecipitation in immunoprecipitation buffer (50 mm Tris (pH 8.0), 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.5% Nonidet P-40). This double-purified GST-Nkx3.2-HA protein, immobilized on protein G-agarose beads, was used for the binding site selection assay. The CAST assay was carried out essentially as previously described with some modifications (22Steadman D.J. Giuffrida D. Gelmann E.P. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 2389-2395Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 23Chen C.Y. Schwartz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15628-15633Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). Briefly, 0.5 pmol of short double-stranded DNA containing a 15-bp random sequence flanked by 20-bp fixed sequences was incubated in DNA binding buffer (10 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 50 mm NaCl, 7.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 5% glycerol, 5% sucrose, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, and 5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin) with 100 ng of double-purified GST-Nkx3.2-HA protein for 20 min at room temperature. Unbound DNAs were washed away with DNA binding buffer, and the bound DNA sequences were amplified by PCR for the next round. A total of five cycles of CAST were performed, and the final PCR product was cloned into the pCRII-TOPO vector using a TOPO-TA cloning kit (Invitrogen), and the cloned inserts were sequenced. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay (EMSA)—Binding reactions for EMSAs were done in 10 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 50 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 2.5 mm dithiothreitol, 5% glycerol, 5 μg/ml poly(dI)-poly(dC), and 250 μg/ml bovine serum albumin. Reaction mixtures were incubated with various 32P-labeled probes (250,000 cpm/reaction). All of the EMSA probes were labeled by PCR using [α-32P]dCTP after annealing indicated top and bottom strand oligonucleotides described under “Oligonucleotides.” If necessary, anti-GST antibody or the indicated cold competitors (25- or 100-fold excess) were preincubated before the addition of the various 32P-labeled probes. Binding reactions were electrophoresed through 5% polyacrylamide gels (39:1 acrylamide/bis) containing 2.5% glycerol in 0.5× TBE buffer at room temperature. The gel was then fixed, dried, and exposed to x-ray film. Cell Culture and Reporter Assays—Murine NIH-3T3 fibroblasts were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal calf serum. For transient transfection, FuGENE6 from Roche Applied Science was used according to the manufacturer's instructions. Following the transfections, the cells were incubated for 40 h before harvest. For each transfection, 100 ng of reporter construct, 200 ng of the indicated expression plasmid, and 20 ng of pRL-TK normalization plasmid were used per single well of a 12-well plate. pCS2 empty vector was used to adjust total DNA amounts where necessary. Dual luciferase assays were carried out with total cell extracts as recommended by Promega. All transfection experiments were performed in duplicate, and results were normalized to the expression of the Renilla luciferase transfection control. Chick Embryo Explant Culture, Retroviral Infection, and RT-PCR Analysis—Construction of RCAS(A)-Nkx3.2 (10Murtaugh L.C. Zeng L. Chyung J.H. Lassar A.B. Dev. Cell. 2001; 1: 411-422Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar) and RCAS(A)-Nkx3.2-N200Q (see “Plasmids and Molecular Cloning”) viruses has been previously described. RCAS(A)-GFP was generously provided by Cliff Tabin. RCAS retroviruses were produced from chicken embryonic fibroblasts exactly as previously described (24Morgan B.A. Fekete D.M. Methods Cell Biol. 1996; 51: 185-218Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Dissection and culture of presomitic mesoderm (psm) explants was previously described (8Zeng L. Kempf H. Murtaugh L.C. Sato M.E. Lassar A.B. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 1990-2005Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar, 10Murtaugh L.C. Zeng L. Chyung J.H. Lassar A.B. Dev. Cell. 2001; 1: 411-422Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). BMP4 protein was added to a final concentration of 100 ng/ml on the second day of explant culture. For retroviral infection, each freshly dissected psm explant was placed into a droplet on a Petri dish consisting of 5 μl of culture medium and 5 μl of concentrated viral supernatant. This Petri dish was then placed on ice for 1 h before the explants were removed and embedded in collagen. RNA harvest and RT-PCR analyses of explants were carried out as described previously (8Zeng L. Kempf H. Murtaugh L.C. Sato M.E. Lassar A.B. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 1990-2005Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar, 10Murtaugh L.C. Zeng L. Chyung J.H. Lassar A.B. Dev. Cell. 2001; 1: 411-422Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Determination of Nkx3.2 Consensus DNA Binding Sequence by CAST—To define a consensus sequence for Nkx3.2 DNA binding, the CAST (also known as selected and amplified binding sequence, or SAAB) assay was employed as previously described (22Steadman D.J. Giuffrida D. Gelmann E.P. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 2389-2395Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 23Chen C.Y. Schwartz R.J. J. Biol.

Science. 1990; 250: 1149-1151Crossref PubMed Scopus (698) Google Scholar). Recombinant GST-Nkx3.2-HA protein was bacterially expressed and double-purified by GST purification and subsequent anti-HA antibody immunoprecipitation as described under “Experimental Procedures.” SDS-PAGE and Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining verified purification of GST-Nkx3.2-HA to homogeneity (data not shown). This double-purified GST-Nkx3.2-HA protein, immobilized on protein G-agarose beads, was used to select high affinity binding sequences from a pool of oligonucleotides containing 15 random base pairs flanked by 20 base pairs of invariant sequence. Five cycles of CAST were performed, and the isolated high affinity binding sequences were cloned and sequenced. Negative control experiments using GST protein were carried out in parallel and did not result in any significant sequence selection. Alignment of 24 selected sequences obtained from the Nkx3.2 CAST, along with the percentage occurrence of each base at each position, is shown in Fig. 1. Analysis revealed TAAGTG as both the most frequently observed hexanucleotide motif (Fig. 1, open boxed) and the consensus sequence for Nkx3.2 DNA binding. A significant preference for G nucleotides (50%) was also observed at the position immediately 3′ to this TAAGTG sequence (Fig. 1), which we refer to as the Nkx3.2 binding element (NBE). Nkx3.2 Binds to the NBE in a Sequence-specific Manner—To confirm that Nkx3.2 can specifically bind to the NBE sequence in vitro, either purified GST or GST-Nkx3.2-HA recombinant proteins were incubated with 32P-labeled NBE probe (containing three reiterations of the sequence TAAGTG; 3×-TAAGTG) and analyzed by EMSA. Whereas GST failed to form a complex with the NBE probe, incubation of this probe with GST-Nkx3.2-HA resulted in a significant DNA-protein complex (Fig. 2A, compare lanes 2 and 3). Since complexes of three distinct electrophoretic mobilities were repeatedly observed following incubation of GST-Nkx3.2-HA with the NBE probe, which contained three reiterations of the TAAGTG sequence, we surmise that these distinct complexes may represent DNA-protein complexes containing different numbers of Nkx3.2 molecules bound to the DNA probe. To further confirm the identity of these shifted bands, anti-GST antibody was added to the binding reaction prior to electrophoresis. As expected, the addition of the anti-GST antibody decreased the mobility of the GST-Nkx3.2-NBE complex and diminished the total amount of this DNA-protein complex (Fig. 2A, lane 5). To determine whether Nkx3.2 binds to the NBE (TAAGTG) in a sequence-specific manner, the binding affinity of Nkx3.2 to either the “wild-type” NBE probe or two different mutant NBE probes, NBE-m1 (containing three reiterations of the sequence TAGATG) and NBE-m2 (containing three reiterations of the sequence TAGGCG), was analyzed. Purified recombinant GST-Nkx3.2-HA protein was incubated with 32P-labeled NBE, NBE-m1, or NBE-m2 probes, and each binding reaction was analyzed by EMSA. Whereas Nkx3.2 formed a stable complex with the NBE probe, it failed to form a complex with either the NBE-m1 or NBE-m2 probes (Fig. 2B, compare lanes 2, 4, and 6). These results confirm that Nkx3.2 binds to the NBE in a sequence-specific manner. Nkx3.2 Binds to Various NBE-related Sequences but with Lower Affinities—The NBE (TAAGTG) sequence is very similar to the previously characterized consensus binding sites of other closely related homeoproteins (22Steadman D.J. Giuffrida D. Gelmann E.P. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 2389-2395Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 23Chen C.Y. Schwartz R.J. J. Biol.

For example, CAAGTG, TAAGTA, and TAATTG have been characterized as high affinity binding sequences for Nkx2.1 (28Guazzi S. Price M. De Felice M. Damante G. Mattei M.G. Di Lauro R. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 3631-3639Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar), Nkx3.1 (22Steadman D.J. Giuffrida D. Gelmann E.P. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 2389-2395Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), and Msx1/Hox7.1 (29Catron K.M. Iler N. Abate C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 2354-2365Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar), respectively. Accordingly, we investigated whether Nkx3.2 can also bind to these related consensus sequences. 32P-Labeled probes containing three reiterations of either TAAGTG (NBE), CAAGTG, TAATTG, or TAAGTA were incubated with increasing amounts of GST-Nkx3.2-HA (10, 40, or 100 ng), and binding of Nkx3.2 to the various sequences was analyzed by EMSA. Whereas the highest concentration of Nkx3.2 yielded a protein-DNA complex with each of these highly related sequences, Nkx3.2 bound to these non-NBE sequences with lower affinity relative to the NBE sequence, as indicated by the relatively lesser amount of shifted probe (Fig. 3A). Surprisingly, Nkx3.2 bound to the Nkx2.1 and Msx binding sites (CAAGTG and TAATTG, respectively) more avidly than to the DNA binding sequence (TAAGTA) of the highly related Nkx family member, Nkx3.1 (Fig. 3A, compare lanes 8, 12, and 16). To further confirm that Nkx3.2 binds with a higher affinity to the NBE relative to these other NBE-related sequences, the ability of these latter sequences to compete for NBE binding was explored. Purified GST-Nkx3.2-HA recombinant protein was incubated with the 32P-labeled NBE probe either in the absence or the presence of excess cold competitors, and the DNA/protein interaction was analyzed by EMSA. Nkx3.2 binding to the hot NBE probe (Fig. 3B, lane 2) was nearly completely extinguished in the presence of a 25-fold excess of cold NBE competitor (TAAGTG) (Fig. 3B, lane 3). In contrast, a 25-fold excess of cold competitors containing either CAAGTG, TAATTG, or TAAGTA sequences failed to compete for Nkx3.2 binding to the hot NBE probe as effectively as did the cold NBE probe (Fig. 3B, compare lanes 3, 5, 7, and 9). A 100-fold excess of all of the tested cold competitors successfully abolished Nkx3.2 DNA binding to the hot NBE probe (Fig. 3B, lanes 4, 6, 8, and 10). As a negative control, a competition EMSA using the NBE-m2 sequence as a cold competitor was carried out. Unlike the NBE or NBE-related sequences, neither a 25-fold nor a 100-fold excess of the cold NBE-m2 competitor significantly diminished Nkx3.2 binding to the hot NBE probe (Fig. 3C, compare lanes 2, 3, and 4). Together, these findings indicate that Nkx3.2 can also bind to various NBE-related sequences but with relatively lower affinities compared with the NBE sequence. Systematic Characterization of Nkx3.2 Interaction with Sequences Deviating from the NBE—Because all Nkx3.2 DNA binding sites identified by the CAST technique contained A, G, and T at positions 3, 4, and 5, respectively (Fig. 1), it seems likely that these invariant residues are critical for interaction of Nkx3.2 with DNA. However, to systematically examine whether other nucleotides are necessary to support high affinity interaction of Nkx3.2 with the NBE sequence, we incubated Nkx3.2 with a hot NBE probe (TAAGTG) and added a 100-fold molar excess of oligonucleotides differing from the NBE sequence by a single base pair substitution in either the first, second, third, or sixth positions. We found that NBE-related oligonucleotides containing T in the first position competed slightly better for Nkx3.2 interaction than those containing either A or C in this position (Fig. 3D, lanes 3, 4, and 6), whereas oligonucleotides containing a G in this position failed to significantly compete for Nkx3.2 binding (Fig. 3D, lane 5). NBE-related oligonucleotides containing A in the second position competed slightly better for Nkx3.2 interaction than those containingaGin this position (Fig. 3D, lanes 7 and 9), whereas oligonucleotides containing either a C or T in this position failed to significantly compete for Nkx3.2 binding (Fig. 3D, lanes 8 and 10). Thus, Nkx3.2 can interact with sequences displaying some nucleotide variation at positions 1 and 2 of the NBE. In contrast, the binding site specificity for positions 3 and 6 is apparently invariant, since Nkx3.2 only bound to sequences containing A and G at these respective positions in the NBE (Fig. 3D, lanes 11–18). Consistent with our statistical analyses of the CAST results, as shown in Fig. 1, TAAGTG was clearly the strongest binding sequence for Nkx3.2. Furthermore, these findings allow us to more broadly define the Nkx3.2 DNA binding consensus as HRAGTG (where H represents A, C, or T, and R represents A or G; see Fig. 3E). Nkx3.2 Can Regulate the Expression of an NBE-driven Reporter Gene in Vivo—Since we have shown that Nkx3.2 can bind to the NBE in vitro, we next examined whether Nkx3.2 can regulate the expression of an NBE-containing reporter gene in vivo. Either an empty vector (pCS2) or an expression vehicle encoding Nkx3.2 (pCS2-Nkx3.2) was co-transfected into NIH-3T3 murine fibroblasts with either the pGL3P luciferase control reporter (Promega) or the NBE-pGL3P luciferase reporter, which contains three NBE sites upstream of the SV40 basal promoter and luciferase reporter gene. Whereas Nkx3.2 only modestly repressed the expression of a co-transfected pGL3P luciferase reporter construct (∼1.5-fold on average) (Fig. 4A, compare lanes 1 and 2), Nkx3.2 significantly repressed the expression of the NBE-pGL3P luciferase reporter by ∼10-fold (Fig. 4A, compare lanes 3 and 4). These results suggest that Nkx3.2 can repress the expression of a reporter gene in vivo in an NBE-dependent manner. We surmise that the repression of the parental pGL3P reporter by Nkx3.2 may reflect low affinity binding sites for Nkx3.2 that are fortuitously present in this construct. To investigate whether the repression of the NBE-pGL3P luciferase reporter by Nkx3.2 is indeed mediated by direct binding of Nkx3.2 to the NBE sites, the NBE-m1-pGL3P and NBE-m2-pGL3P luciferase reporters, which contain mutant NBE sequences that do not bind to Nkx3.2 (Figs. 2B and 3C), were analyzed in similar reporter assays. Unlike the NBE-pGL3P luciferase reporter, neither the NBE-m1-pGL3P nor the NBE-m2-pGL3P luciferase reporter exhibited any significant repression beyond the intrinsic response of the parental pGL3P luciferase reporter to co-transfected Nkx3.2 (Fig. 4A, compare lanes 2, 6, and 8). These results indicate that Nkx3.2-mediated repression of the NBE-pGL3P luciferase reporter is dependent on Nkx3.2 binding to the NBE sequences. To further confirm the in vivo interaction between Nkx3.2 and the NBE sequence, we employed Nkx3.2-VP16, in which the strong transcriptional activation domain of HSV-VP16 (30Sadowski I. Ma J. Triezenberg S. Ptashne M. Nature. 1988; 335: 563-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (989) Google Scholar) is fused to the carboxyl terminus of Nkx3.2. Either the pCS2 expression vehicle or pCS2 encoding either Nkx3.2 or Nkx3.2-VP16 was co-transfected into NIH-3T3 cells along with the NBE-pGL3P luciferase reporter. Whereas wild-type Nkx3.2 repressed the expression of the NBE-pGL3P luciferase reporter as expected (Fig. 4B, compare lanes 1 and 2), Nkx3.2-VP16 strongly activated the NBE-pGL3P luciferase reporter (Fig. 4B, compare lanes 1 and 3). These results verify that Nkx3.2 directly binds to NBE sites and regulates transcription in vivo.

One of the most toxic components of snake venom is phospholipase A2 (PLA2; EC 3.1.1.4). PLA2 isolated from the elapid, Naja sputatrix, induced pulmonary inflammation and edema when administered intravenously and intratracheally to rats. Analysis of pulmonary gene expression profiles using oligonucleotide microarrays revealed 60 genes whose expression was altered by at least 3-fold in response to intratracheal instillation of PLA2 for 3 h as compared with controls. In addition to genes encoding cytokines and chemokines responsible for inflammatory processes, the Na+/K+-ATPase gene has been found to be involved in edema formation. Real-time PCR, Western blot, and immunohistochemical analyses confirmed that the expression of AQP1 and AQP5 mRNAs and proteins was decreased. Besides providing an experimental model for studies on the pathophysiology of the lung, this investigation yields a clue to the mechanisms by which endogenous PLA2s could mediate inflammation in conditions such as allergy and rheumatoid arthritis.

Snake venoms are chemically complex mixtures of pharmacologically active proteins, many of which also have enzymatic properties (1Stocker K.F. Stocker K.W. Medical Use of Snake Venom Proteins. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1990: 33-56Google Scholar). Because venoms serve not only as a source of digestive enzymes but also as a defense mechanism, these proteins can target multiple tissues, causing a simultaneous poisoning of multiple physiological systems. From these venoms, hundreds of toxins have been purified and characterized. One of the components that contributes significantly to the lethality of snake venoms is phospholipase A2 (PLA2) 1The abbreviations used are: PLA2, phospholipase A2; AQP, aquaporin; nsPLA2, Naja sputatrix phospholipase A2; COX-2, cyclooxygenase-2; IL, interleukin; TNF-α, tumor necrosis factor-α; Tricine, N-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycine. (EC 3.1.1.4) (2Verheij H.M. Glaser K.B. Vadas P. Phospholipases in Clinical Inflammation. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1996: 3-24Google Scholar). Venom PLA2s are low-molecular weight (13,000–14,000 Da), secretory phospholipases containing seven disulfide bonds (3Dennis E.A. Boyer P.D. The Enzymes. Academic Press, New York1983: 307-353Google Scholar). Like all PLA2s, venom PLA2 catalyzes the hydrolysis of the sn-2 fatty acyl bond of phospholipids to release free fatty acids and lysophospholipids in the presence of Ca2+ (4Rosenberg P. Harris J.B. Natural Toxins. Oxford University Press, New York1986: 129-174Google Scholar). However, unlike secretory pancreatic PLA2, which serves a mainly digestive function, venom PLA2 exhibits a host of additional pharmacological properties that include antiplatelet, anticoagulant, hemolytic, neurotoxic (presynaptic), myotoxic, hemorrhagic, inflammatory, and cardiotoxic activities (5Harris J.B. Harvey A.L. Snake Toxins. Pergamon Press, London1991: 91-129Google Scholar, 6Yang C.C. J. Toxicol. Toxin Rev. 1994; 13: 125-177Crossref Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 7Henrikson R.L. Kruger E. Keim P.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 4913-4921Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Neutral PLA2 purified from the venom of the elapid, Naja sputatrix (nsPLA2; Malayan spitting cobra) was used in this study. This is a Group IA PLA2 that has a disulfide bridge between the half-cysteines at positions 11 and 69. PLA2 found in mammalian pancreatic juice belongs to Group IB as it contains a pancreatic loop. However, both groups are secretory PLA2s. Another group of secretory PLA2s, Group II PLA2s are found in crotalid venom and mammalian cells (3Dennis E.A. Boyer P.D. The Enzymes. Academic Press, New York1983: 307-353Google Scholar, 8Gold B.S. Dart R.C. Banish R.A. N. Eng. J. Med. 2002; 347: 356-357Crossref Scopus (341) Google Scholar). In our laboratory, we have found that when nsPLA2 is injected intravenously into rats, it brought about death characterized by paralysis following muscle spasms and respiratory failure. This was accompanied by inflammation and edematous swelling of lung tissue. Respiratory compromise is a sign of moderate to severe envenomation and is observed in many victims of snake bites (9Chu J. Wang R.Y. Hill N.S. Am. J. Respir. Crit. Care Med. 2002; 166: 9-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 10Britt A. Burkhent K. Am. J. Emerg.

India. 2001; 49: 25-28PubMed Google Scholar). In fact, envenomation by elapids has been shown to produce respiratory distress followed by death within 10 min (12Fletcher J.E. Rosenberg P. Kini R.M. Venom Phospholipases A2Structure, Function and Mechanism. John Wiley & Sons, West Sussex, United Kingdom1997: 428-432Google Scholar). Being a presynaptically acting PLA2, nsPLA2 blocks acetylcholine release at the neuromuscular junction, leading to muscle paralysis (13Edelson J.D. Vadas P. Villar J. Mullen J.B.M. Pruzanski W. Am. Rev. Respir. Dis. 1991; 143: 1102-1109Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and airway paralysis as well. The mechanism by which it causes pulmonary inflammation and edema, however, is not understood. Maintenance of clear airspaces and regulation of fluid movement between the vascular, interstitial, and airway compartments are vital for normal lung function. Disruption of this homeostasis will severely affect gas exchange and lung mechanics, leading eventually to respiratory failure. Previous studies of venom toxin-induced lung inflammation provide clues to pathophysiology (14Costa E.P. Clissa P.B. Teixeira C.F.P. Moura-da-Silva A.M. Inflammation. 2002; 26: 13-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 15Ali A.A. Alam J.M. Abbasi A. Zaidi Z.H. Stoera S. Voelter W. Toxicon. 2000; 38: 687-705Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 16Armugam A. Earnest L. Chung M.C.M. Gopalakrishnakone P. Tan C.H. Jeyaseelan K. Toxicon. 2001; 35: 27-37Crossref Scopus (25) Google Scholar) but expression studies were at best limited to a few selected genes. In this report, we investigate the mechanisms of nsPLA2-induced inflammation and fluid accumulation by studying the gene expression profiles of lungs from rats treated intravenously and intratracheally with nsPLA2 for 10 and 1 and 3 h, respectively, using oligonucleotide microarrays. This technology allows the simultaneous quantitation and comparison of the expression of ∼8000 genes and expressed sequence tags found in rat genome arrays. Here, we show that the expression of inflammatory cytokines and related genes (e.g. cyclooxygenase-2) was significantly up-regulated while interestingly, the expression of water-transporting membrane channels such as aquaporins and the Na+/K+-ATPase pump was decreased. These observations shed light on the pathways activated by nsPLA2 during pulmonary inflammation and consequently, on the causes of respiratory failure upon snake envenomation. Additionally, the data may provide evidence for a physiological role played by water and ion channels in the maintenance of lung fluid balance. Purification of nsPLA 2 —N. sputatrix crude venom was obtained from Sigma. The nsPLA2 was purified using Sephadex G-100 gel filtration chromatography (Amersham Biosciences) followed by reverse phase high perofrmance liquid chromatography and then characterized as described (16Armugam A. Earnest L. Chung M.C.M. Gopalakrishnakone P. Tan C.H. Jeyaseelan K. Toxicon. 2001; 35: 27-37Crossref Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The purified fractions were quantitated using the Bradford assay (Bio-Rad). Experimental Groups—All animals were handled according to the guidelines (58Howard-Jones N.A. WHO Chronicle. 1995; 39: 51-56Google Scholar) given by the Council for International Organization of Medical Sciences (CIOMS) on animal experimentation (WHO, Geneva, Switzerland). Male Sprague-Dawley rats (200–220 g) were maintained on an ad libitum intake of standard laboratory chow and drinking water prior to and after treatments. Various doses of nsPLA2, which has an LD50 value of 125 μg/200 g body weight in Sprague-Dawley rats, were administered either intravenously or intratracheally. For intravenous administration, the rats were restrained and nsPLA2 was delivered via tail vein injection. For intratracheal administration, the rats were anaesthetized intraperitoneally with a mixture (100 μl/100 g body weight) consisting of an equal volume of hypnorm (0.315 mg of fentanyl and 10 mg of fluanosome; Jansen Pharmaceutica, Beerse, Belgium) and midazolam (5 mg of dormicum and 2 ml of water; Roche Diagnostics). An anterior midline incision was made and nsPLA2 was instilled into the trachea using a 27[1,2]-gauge needle and a 1-ml syringe (BD Biosciences). The tracheal site was closed using 3/0 silk sutures (Aesculap AG & Co. KG, Tuttlingen) and the rats were allowed to recover. Consequently, there were a total of 3 treatment groups. (a) Intravenous administration of 240 μg/200 g body weight of nsPLA2 for 10 h (PLA2 IV 10 h; n = 6); (b) intratracheal administration of 48 μg/200 g body weight of nsPLA2 for 1 h (PLA2 IT1hr, n = 6); and (c) 3 h (PLA2 IT3hr, n = 9). Control rats (n = 15) were treated similarly but with 100 μl of vehicle (0.9% NaCl) instead. All rats were sacrificed at the various time points by cervical dislocation and whole lungs were rapidly removed, pooled, and snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen. Frozen lungs were stored at –70 °C until use. RNA Isolation—Total RNA was isolated from nsPLA2-treated and control lungs by a single-step method using Trizol reagent (Invitrogen) from lung tissues. The RNA samples were subsequently treated with RNase-free DNase I at 37 °C for 20 min and stored at –70 °C until use. Real-time Quantitative PCR—Real-time PCR was carried out as described (17Jeyaseelan K. Ma D.H. Armugam A. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: e58Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) with the following modifications. The PCR amplification for AQP5 was performed for 40 cycles with each cycle at 94 °C for 20 s, 50 °C for 20 s, and 60 °C for 40 s. The forward and reverse primers for the AQP1 gene were 5′-GGCTTCAATTACCCACTGGAG-3′ and 5′-CCAGCGACACCTTCACGTT-3′, respectively; AQP5 gene, 5′-CCTCCATGATCGCGTGGCTGT-3′ and 5′-TCGATGATCTTCCCAGTCCT-3′, respectively; and Na +/K + -ATPase-α1 gene were 5′-GGCTGTCATCTTCCTCATTGGT-3′ and 5′-CGGTGGCCAGCAAACC-3′, respectively. The Taqman™ probes for AQPs 1, 5, and Na +/K + -ATPase-α1 genes were 5′-AACCAGACGCTGGTCCAG-3′, 5′-TCAAAGGCACATATGAGCC-3′, and 5′-TCATCGTAGCCAACGTGCCGGA-3′, respectively. Ribosomal RNA was used as an internal calibrator. The probes for the AQP and ribosomal RNA genes had been labeled with reporter fluorescent dyes, 6-carboxyfluorescein and VIC, respectively, at their 5′ ends while their 3′ ends were labeled with a quencher dye, 6-carboxytetramethylrhodamine. All primers and probes were synthesized by Applied Biosystems. Protein Isolation—Lung tissue from nsPLA2-treated and control rats were isolated and placed in chilled isolation buffer containing 0.9% NaCl and 50 mm EDTA. Whole tissues were homogenized in 3 ml of ice-cold homogenization buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl adjusted to pH 7.4, 300 mm mannitol, and 50 mm EDTA. Homogenates were centrifuged at 100 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was removed and centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 30 min. The resulting supernatant was collected and the total protein concentration in each sample was measured using the Bradford assay (Bio-Rad). Western Blot Analysis—Total membrane proteins (70 μg/sample) were separated by Tris-Tricine SDS-PAGE as described (18Schagger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10477) Google Scholar). Electrotransfer was carried out for 1 h on ice onto nitrocellulose membranes (Protran™, Schleicher & Schuell). Membranes were blocked for 1 h in 1% blocking solution (skim milk in TBST (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 3 mm KCl, and 0.1% Tween 20)) followed by incubation overnight at 4 °C with affinity purified, polyclonal anti-AQP1 (a kind gift from Dr. Mark Knepper, National Institutes of Health) at a dilution of 1 μg/ml and anti-AQP5 at a dilution of 2 μg/ml (Alpha Diagnostics International, San Antonio, TX) in 0.5% blocking solution. After three washes of 10 min each in TBST, membranes were incubated for 1 h at room temperature with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit (AQPs 1 and 5; Bio-Rad) secondary antibody at a dilution of 1:50,000 in 0.5% blocking solution, washed twice for 10 min each in TBST, and visualized via enhanced chemiluminescence (SuperSignal; Pierce) with variable exposures (Kodak-MS film). To confirm equivalent loading of samples, separate sets of gels were run simultaneously and stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue. Films of Western blots were scanned (Acer SWZ3300U) and labeling intensities of the bands were quantitated using AIS software (Synoptics Imaging Systems). Histology and Immunohistochemistry—Histopathologic changes and immunohistochemical staining for AQP1 and AQP5 were evaluated in nsPLA2-treated and control lungs fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde. Fixed lung tissues were embedded in paraffin, sectioned at 7-μm, and stained with hematoxylin and eosin for morphologic analysis. Paraffin-embedded tissues were sectioned at 5 μm and processed as described (19Johnston H. Koukoulas I. Jeyaseelan K. Armugam A. Earnest L. Baird R. Dawson N. Ferraro T. Wintour E.M. Placenta. 2000; 21: 88-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) for immunohistochemical staining using the same AQP1 and AQP5 antibodies as those for Western blot analysis. Microarray GeneChip™ Analysis—Total RNA isolated from rat lungs was processed and hybridized to each array of the RG_U34A GeneChip™ Array Set according to the protocols described in the GeneChip™ expression analysis technical manual (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA). Two chips were used for each experimental group. Data from each treatment were scaled to an average intensity of 800 and a comparison of signal intensities using Microsoft Excel showed results from duplicate chips highly correlated with R 2 values = 0.98. Relative mRNA expression levels were expressed as plus or minus fold changes compared with saline-treated controls using Microarray Suite software 5.0 (Affymetrix). All genes showing a change of 3-fold or more in at least one experimental condition were included in subsequent analyses. Self-organizing map clustering was performed using GeneSpring 5.1 (Silicon Genetics, Redwood City, CA). Values below 0 were set to 0 and per chip normalization was carried out by dividing each measurement by the 50th percentile of all measurements in that sample. Per gene normalization was performed by dividing each gene by the median of its measurements in all samples. Normalized profiles were grouped on the basis of similarity in their temporal expression patterns using the self-organizing map. Cluster members were classified according to their biological functions as described in the NetAffx data base (Affymetrix). Wet-Dry Lung Weight Ratios—Whole lungs were excised from nsPLA2-treated and control rats and weighed to obtain lung wet weights (n = 3 per group). Lungs were dried in a 62 °C oven with desiccant and weighed again after 7 days to obtain dry weights. Statistical Analysis—Statistical analyses were performed using unpaired Student's t test and results were expressed as mean ± S.E. A p value of <0.05 was considered statistically significant. Intravenous injection of nsPLA2 (240 μg/200 g body weight; 2× LD50) into rats caused death characterized by paralysis and severe respiratory distress after ∼10 h. Morphologic observation of the lungs indicated gross swelling and inflammation. To quantitatively assess pulmonary edema in animals injected with nsPLA2 intravenously, whole lung wet-to-dry weight ratios were determined. The wet-to-dry weight ratio of whole lungs from rats 10 h after introduction of nsPLA2 intravenously proved to be significantly increased (170 ± 1% of saline-treated controls, p < 0.05; Fig. 1B). To study the effects of nsPLA2 on the lungs alone, the toxin was administered locally via intratracheal instillation (48 μg/200g body weight, 0.4× LD50) for 1 and 3 h. Because nsPLA2 was applied directly to the lungs of rats by intratracheal administration, a much lower dose of nsPLA2 (0.4× LD50) was required to induce inflammation and edema as compared with that for intravenous injection (2× LD50), which would have caused nsPLA2 to enter the systemic circulation. Lung histology was used to assess inflammation in rats after intratracheal instillation of nsPLA2 for 3 h (Fig. 1A). Pulmonary infiltrate and edema fluid were observed in the alveolar airspaces 3 h after nsPLA2 administration (Fig. 1A, center and right panels) as compared with the saline-treated control (Fig. 1A, left panel), which showed clear airspaces. The infiltrate was not detected in bronchial or pulmonary vascular regions. Alveolar epithelia remained intact and there were no indications of cell membrane disruption or lysis. Lung sections obtained from rats treated intravenously with nsPLA2 for 10 h showed the same extent of cellular infiltration and fluid accumulation as those for PLA2 IT3hr lungs whereas lung sections from rats treated intratracheally with nsPLA2 for 1 h showed a lesser extent of inflammation (results not shown). Quantitative measurement of edema showed that the wet-to-dry weight ratios of PLA2 IT1hr and PLA2 IT3hr lungs were significantly increased (138 ± 2 and 185 ± 1% of saline-treated controls, respectively, p < 0.05; Fig. 1B). To understand the molecular mechanisms underlying the nsPLA2-induced pulmonary inflammation and edema, microarray analysis was performed on intratracheally treated lungs. Lung tissue was pooled from 3 rats per treatment group to minimize inter-individual variations. Each GeneChip in the RG_U34A Array Set represents ∼8800 genes and expressed sequence tags. All probe sets designated “absent” by the analysis software were discarded and only genes whose expression changed by 3-fold or greater in at least one pairwise comparison were deemed significant. These probe sets were subjected to self-organizing map clustering where genes were grouped according to their expression patterns in response to nsPLA2 administration over two time points. Two clusters were selected and they contained genes whose expression was changed after nsPLA2 treatment for 1 h followed by a dramatic increase or decrease in expression after 3 h (Fig. 2A). The changes at both time points occurred in the same direction in all cases and hence, indicate that a longer exposure to nsPLA2 only augmented its effects at the molecular level. Cluster 1 represents genes whose expression was induced after intratracheal instillation of nsPLA2 and which may play important roles in the development of inflammation and edema. Cluster 2 represents genes that were down-regulated by nsPLA2. Despite the apparent similarity in expression profiles within each cluster, the representation of each gene by its normalized signal intensity shows the varying extent to which nsPLA2 alters gene expression. These genes were further assigned to categories according to their known functions in physiological pathways and the results are shown in Table I, together with the corresponding -fold changes in expression. Taken together, Cluster 1 consists of genes primarily involved in causing and perpetuating inflammation (cytokines, chemokines and acute phase proteins), signal transduction (growth factors, receptors, kinases, phosphatases, and transcription factors), and oxidative damage (generators of free radicals and products of oxidative stress), whereas Cluster 2 contain gene groups that are less well defined, including those encoding signaling proteins (e.g. cyclase-associated protein homologue and protein kinase, MUK), proteins involved in lipid metabolism (e.g. pancreatic phospholipase A2 and fatty acid synthase), a protease (cathepsin D), an antioxidant (glutathione S-transferase), and a heat shock protein (HSP-90). Expectedly, inflammatory genes such as macrophage inflammatory protein-1 (+42.2- and +104.0-fold increases 1 and 3 h, respectively) and interleukin-6 (+7.0- and +362.0-fold after 1 and 3 h, respectively) were most highly up-regulated in response to nsPLA2 treatment as compared with the saline-treated control. Interestingly, the expression of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) was increased 27.9-fold whereas lipoxygenase-5 expression was unchanged. Both these enzymes generate distinct eicasanoids from arachidonic acid. Induction of COX-2 alone indicates that this pathway is activated by nsPLA2 rather than the lipoxygenase-5 pathway and its downstream products mediate inflammation.Fig. 2Self-organizing map and functional clustering of genes that exhibited a 3-fold or greater change in expression after intratracheal instillation of nsPLA2 for 1 and 3 h. Two selected self-organizing map clusters are shown and they contain genes whose expression profiles were altered in a similar pattern after nsPLA2 administration.

Open table in a new tab A gene that may provide a clue to the development of pulmonary edema is Na+/K+-ATPase-α. Its expression was significantly decreased (–3.7-fold) 3 h after intratracheal instillation. Real-time PCR analysis was carried out to validate the results obtained by microarray (Fig. 3). It was shown that the expression of Na +/K + -ATPase-α was indeed down-regulated (∼3.3-fold, p < 0.05) by nsPLA2 after 3 h while its expression was not significantly increased after 1 h (∼0.7-fold). The catalytic α subunit of the ATPase exchanges intracellular Na+ for extracellular K+, generating an electrochemical gradient that allows coupling of the transport of other molecules into the cells, including the osmotic flow of water (20Horisberger J.-D. The Na,K-ATPase: Structure-Function Relationship. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1994: 11-12Google Scholar). Active Na+ transport across the alveolar epithelium has been shown to be necessary for the resolution of pulmonary edema (21Crandall E.D. Matthay M.A. Am. J. Respir. Crit. Care Med. 2001; 163: 1021-1029Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 22Ingbar D.H. Matthay M.A. Ingbar D.H. Pulmonary Edema. Dekker, New York1998: 477-499Google Scholar, 23Nielsen S. King L.S. Christensen B.M. Agre P. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: C1549-C1561Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) as Na+ flux produces a transepithelial osmotic gradient that causes water to move passively from the airspaces to the alveolar interstitium. Hence, a decrease in Na+/K+-ATPase expression would cause fluid to accumulate in the lungs. In recent years, the discovery of specific water channels known as aquaporins has deepened our understanding of water transport and homeostasis in cells. There are now 11 known AQPs of which AQPs 1 and 5 are found in the distal lung in rats (24Tan N.-H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1982; 719: 599-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Although noticeably absent from Fig. 2 (expression of AQPs 1 and 5 was altered less than 3-fold by nsPLA2; data not shown), we decided to investigate for any significant changes in the expression of AQPs 1 and 5 in nsPLA2-treated rat lungs. Quantitative real-time PCR analysis was carried out for the same pooled RNA samples using a trio of specific primers and probe for each gene (Fig. 4A). The relative expression of AQPs 1 and 5 in PLA2 IV10hr, PLA2 IT1hr, and PLA2 IT3hr lungs was obtained after normalizing against an internal control (18 S ribosomal RNA) and a calibrator, in this case, their saline-treated controls (relative gene expression = 1). Both AQPs 1 and 5 were significantly down-regulated after intratracheal instillation of nsPLA2 for 3 h (AQP1, ∼20-fold and AQP5, ∼10-fold, respectively, p < 0.01) while only AQP1 expression was significantly decreased after 1 h (∼1.7-fold, p < 0.05). Intravenous injection of nsPLA2 also dramatically reduced the expression of AQPs 1 and 5 after 10 h (∼100 fold, p < 0.01). To determine whether the decrease in mRNA levels of AQPs 1 and 5 resulted in a corresponding decrease in their protein levels, Western blot analysis was carried out on PLA2 IV10hr, PLA2 IT1hr, and PLA2 IT3hr lungs. Using an affinity purified polyclonal antibody directed against the AQP1 carboxyl-terminal synthetic peptide, Western blot analysis revealed bands at 28 and ∼35 kDa, representing the native and glycosylated forms, respectively (Fig. 4B). Densitometry of the 28-kDa AQP1 band showed a significant decrease in protein levels 1 and 3 h after intratracheal instillation of nsPLA2 (9 ± 0.5 and 3 ± 0.2% of the saline-treated controls, respectively, p < 0.01) and 10 h after intravenous injection of nsPLA2 (13 ± 1% of the saline-treated control, p < 0.01; Fig. 4C). AQP5 protein expression was analyzed by Western blot using an affinity purified polyclonal antibody directed against the AQP5 carboxyl-terminal synthetic peptide and a band at 29 kDa was revealed (Fig. 4B). Protein levels were significantly decreased 3 h after intratracheal instillation of nsPLA2 (29 ± 3% of the saline-treated control, p < 0.01) and 10 h after intravenous injection of nsPLA2 (4Rosenberg P. Harris J.B. Natural Toxins. Oxford University Press, New York1986: 129-174Google Scholar ± 0.5% of the saline-treated control, p < 0.01; Fig. 4C). AQP5 protein levels of PLA2 IT1hr lungs were"

Ionizing radiation generates a wide spectrum of DNA damage, including strand breaks, abasic (AP) 1The abbreviations used are: AP, abasic; BER, base excision repair; DHU, dihydrouracil; Pol I, polymerase I.1The abbreviations used are: AP, abasic; BER, base excision repair; DHU, dihydrouracil; Pol I, polymerase I. sites, base damages, and cross-links (1von Sonntag C. The Chemical Basis of Radiation Biology. Taylor and Francis, London1987Google Scholar, 2Hall E.J. Radiobiology for the Radiobiologist. J. B. Lippincott Company, Philadelphia1994Google Scholar). The energy of ionizing radiation is not dispersed uniformly in the absorbing medium but as packets of energy along the tracks of the charge particles. Each deposition of energy can generate multiple ionization events that can lead to the generation of a unique class of lesion called clustered lesion (3Ward J.F. Progr. Nucl. Acids Mol. Biol. 1988; 35: 95-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (1170) Google Scholar, 4Sutherland B.M. Bennett P.V. Sidorkina O. Laval J.

In addition, when ionizing radiation interacts directly with DNA, multiple DNA ionizations can occur at the site of interaction that can also lead to the formation of clustered lesion. Thus, both the direct and indirect action of ionizing radiation on DNA can lead to the generation of clustered lesions (3Ward J.F. Progr. Nucl. Acids Mol. Biol. 1988; 35: 95-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (1170) Google Scholar, 4Sutherland B.M. Bennett P.V. Sidorkina O. Laval J.

Res. 1981; 86: 185-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar, 8Hall E.J. Radiology for the Radiologist. J. B. Lippincott Company, Philadelphia1993Google Scholar).The nature of clustered lesions is complex. They can consist of a combination of DNA breaks, AP sites, and base damages, either present on the same or opposing strands of DNA (4Sutherland B.M. Bennett P.V. Sidorkina O. Laval J. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 8026-8031Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar, 5Sutherland B.M. Bennett P.V. Sidorkina O. Laval J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Res. 1981; 86: 185-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). A double strand break can be considered as a clustered lesion consisting of two single strand breaks located in close proximity on opposing strands of DNA. Much effort has been directed to understanding the repair of ionizing radiation-induced lesions such as strand breaks, AP sites, and base lesions; however, the biological process involved in the repair of these lesions within a clustered site is poorly understood. Strand breaks, AP sites, and base damages are repaired predominantly via the base excision repair (BER) pathway (9Freidberg E.C. Walker G.C. Siede W. DNA Repair and Mutagenesis. American Society of Microbiology Press, Washington, D. C.1995Google Scholar, 10Wilson D.W. Engelward B.P. Samson L. Nickoloff J.A. Hoekstra M.F. DNA Repair in Prokaryotes and Lower Eukaryotes. Humana Press, Totowa, New Jersey1998: 29-64Google Scholar). When AP sites and base damages are processed via BER, intermediary strand breaks are generated. For clustered lesions consisting of DNA damage located on opposing strands of DNA, a double strand break can be generated if the excision of the second lesion is initiated before the first lesion is completely repaired. The formation of a double strand break can be more lethal and mutagenic than the original closely opposed lesions. To reduce the formation of double strand breaks during cellular processing of clustered lesions, it is likely that there are mechanisms within cells that help to reduce the probability of initiating the repair of a second lesion before the first lesion is fully repaired.It is interesting to note that many of the DNA repair glycosylases that initiate the repair of base lesions and AP sites are intrinsically inhibited by nearby nicks. Escherichia coli endonuclease III and formamidopyrimidine N-glycosylase activities are inhibited by nicks that are in close proximity and opposite to the base lesion (11Harrison L. Hatahet Z. Purmal A.A. Wallace S.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 932-941Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 12David-Cordonnier M-H. Laval J. O'Neill P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 11865-11873Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 13Takeshita M. Chang C.N. Johnson F. Will S. Grollman A.P. J. Biol.

The observed inhibition could be due to the fact that a nick increases the flexibility of DNA around the remaining lesion. The increased flexibility could lead to a decrease in the affinity of these DNA glycosylases for lesions that are located close to a nick. However, prolonged incubation of DNA containing clustered damage with either endonuclease III or formamidopyrimidine N-glycosylase can still lead to the generation of double strand breaks. Because a nearby nick can only slow down the action of a repair glycosylase, it is therefore likely that additional mechanisms are necessary to further inhibit the action of DNA glycosylases so that generation of double strand breaks can be reduced during the repair of clustered lesions. We had show earlier that KU, a human double-stranded DNA-binding protein, can bind to a nick opposite dihydrouracil (DHU), leading to a significant inhibition of the human endonuclease III activity (15Hashimoto M. Donald C.D. Yannone S.M. Chen D.J. Roy R. Kow Y.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12827-12831Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The increased inhibition of human endonuclease III activity by KU protein will help to reduce the possibility of generating double strand breaks during the repair of closely opposed lesions. Furthermore, even if a double strand break is formed, KU can bind to the ends of a newly generated double strand break and tether the two ends together as a protein-DNA complex, preventing the possibility of mis-joining (15Hashimoto M. Donald C.D. Yannone S.M. Chen D.J. Roy R. Kow Y.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12827-12831Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar).In this study, we showed that the E. coli DNA-binding protein HU also inhibits the activity of E. coli endonuclease III when a nick is present in close proximity and opposite to a base damage. In contrast, HU protein did not inhibit significantly the subsequent steps of the repair process, namely DNA repair synthesis and DNA ligation. Thus HU could potentially mediate the sequential repair of a clustered lesion consisting of closely opposed DNA damage. These data further suggest that DNA-binding proteins that have high affinity for nicks, such as poly (ADP-ribose) DNA polymerase, could also mediate similar processes in the cells.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESDNA Substrates—All oligonucleotides were obtained from Operon and purified by polyacrylamide gel (15%) electrophoresis as described previously (16Yao M. Kow Y.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28609-28616Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Oligonucleotides were 5′-end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP (Amersham Biosciences) using T4 polynucleotide kinase, following the instructions provided by the supplier. 32P-labeled oligonucleotides containing DHU were annealed to the appropriate complementary strands at 1:1.5 ratios in a buffer containing 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.1 m NaCl, and 2 mm mercaptoethanol by heating the mixture to 90 °C and cooling down slowly to room temperature. The oligonucleotide duplexes in Sequence I were used in this study (Q represents dihydrouracil). Duplex N contains a nick and a DHU. The nick is two nucleotides 3′ from DHU on the complementary strand. In contrast, duplex L contains only a single DHU.To determine the effect of distances between the nick and DHU on the inhibition of endonuclease III activity by HU protein, the substrates were prepared as in Sequence II.Sequence IIView Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Duplex DNA containing a 5′ flap was constructed by hybridizing a 5′ 32P-labeled 33-mer and an unlabeled 16-mer with the complementary 30-mer. This will generate a duplex containing a 5′-labeled flap of 19 nucleotides long deriving from the unhybridized 5′ sequences of the 33-mer. The sequence of the three oligonucleotides for preparing the flap DNA is as follows: 33-mer, 5′-ATGTGGAAAATCTCTAGCAGGCTGCAGGTCGAC; 16-mer, 5′-CAGCAACGCAAGCTTG; 30-mer, 5′-GTCGACCTGCAGCCCAAGCTTGCGTTGCTG; and Sequence III, where (Fp) = flap, 5′-ATGTGGAAAATCTCTAGCA.Sequence IIIView Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Enzymes and Proteins—E. coli endonuclease III was purified from an overproducing E. coli strains employing MonoS, MonoQ and phenyl-Sepharose column as described previously (17Asahara H. Wistort P.M. Bank J.F. Bakerian R.H. Cunningham R.P. Biochemistry. 1989; 10: 4444-4449Crossref Scopus (212) Google Scholar). Endonuclease V was purifed from an E. coli overproducing strain employing MonoS, MonoQ, and phenyl-Sepharose (18Yao M. Kow Y.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30774-30779Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). A small amount of HU protein was initially obtained as a gift from Dr. Roger McMaken (John Hopkins University), and was later purified from E. coli strains overproducing HUα and HUβ subunits following published procedures (19Pellegrini O. Oberb J. Pinson V. Rouviere-Yaniv J. Biochimie (Paris). 2000; 82: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). HU protein is an 18-kDa heterodimeric protein consist of HUα and HUβ subunits, each subunit has a molecular mass of 9 kDa (19Pellegrini O. Oberb J. Pinson V. Rouviere-Yaniv J. Biochimie (Paris). 2000; 82: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Briefly, hupA and hupB genes were PCR amplified from E. coli genomic DNA. The hupA gene was PCR-amplified using primers 5′-CCCCCCCCATATGAACAAGACTCAACTGATTGATGTAATT and 5′-CCCCCCCCTCGAGCTTAACTGCGTCTTTCCAGTCCTTGCCA, which introduce NdeI and XhoI restriction sites near the ends of the PCR fragment. Similarly, the hupB gene was PCR-amplified using primers 5′-CCCCCCCCATATGAAATAAATCTCAATTGATCGACAAGATT and 5′-CCCCCCCCTCGAGGTTTACCGCGTCTTTCAGTGCTTTACCT. Each of the PCR products were restricted with NdeI and XhoI, and ligated into pET22b(+) that was previously restricted with NdeI and XhoI, using T4 DNA ligase (16 °C for 16 h) and electroporated into E. coli BL21(pLysS), producing ampicillin-resistant colonies. The constructs thus generated (pHuA and pHuB) code for HUα and HUβ modified to contain six C-terminal histidines. BL21(pLysS) cells harboring either pHuA or pHuB were grown to 0.7 OD, and overproduction of HUα and Huβ were achieved by the addition of 0.5 mm of isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside and continued to grow the cells for an additional 16 h at room temperature. HUα and Huβ proteins were then purified individually using nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid columns, following instructions supplied by the manufacturer (Novagen). E. coli DNA polymerase I and E. coli DNA ligase were purchased from USB biochemicals.Enzyme Assays—Endonuclease III activity was assayed in a standard reaction mix (10 μl) containing 0.1 m KCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 50 fmol of labeled DNA substrates, and 20 fmol of endonuclease III. The reaction was performed at 37 °C for 10 min.Nick translation catalyzed by E. coli DNA polymerase I was performed in a buffer solution (10 μl) containing 67 mm potassium phosphate, pH 8.0, 6.7 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 50 mm NaCl, 33 μm dATP, 33 μm dCTP, 33 μm dGTP, and 33 μm dTTP. Duplex N (see Sequence I) is composed of a 56-mer containing a DHU hybridized to two complementary DNA, a 21-mer and a 35-mer. The 35-mer was 5′-end-labeled with 32P and used as the primer for E. coli polymerase I-dependent nick translation DNA synthesis. The rate of formation of a labeled full-length product was used as an estimate for the E. coli polymerase I activity.DNA ligation was also performed with duplex N in a ligation buffer (10 μl) containing 30 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 4 mm MgCl2, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 20 μm NAD+, and 5 μg of bovine serum albumin. In this case, the 21-mer was 5′-end-labeled to provide the 5′-phosphoryl group that is required for the ligation reaction. The rate of formation of a full-length, 5′-end-labeled 56-mer was used for estimation for the DNA ligase activity.Endonuclease III, nick translation and DNA ligation reactions were stopped with 5 μl of a stop buffer containing 90% formamide, 10 mm EDTA, 0,.1% xylene, and 0.1% bromphenol blue. After the addition of a stop buffer, the reaction mixture was immediately heated at 90 °C for 10 min. A 5-μl sample was loaded onto a 12.5% denaturing polyacrylamide gel and electrophoresed at 2000 V for 1.5 h. The polyacrylamide gel was then dried and the amount of products formed was estimated by using the STORM PhosphoImager (Amersham Biosciences).RESULTSEffect of HU Protein on Endonuclease III Activity—HU protein binds tightly to various DNA replication and recombination intermediate structures (20Kamashev D.

In addition, it has a high affinity for DNA containing nicks and small gaps. Castaing et al. (23Castaing B. Zelwer C. Laval J. Boiteux S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10291-10296Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar) showed that HU bound to DNA containing one base gap generated by DNA glycosylases. These data suggest that HU might play a role in preventing the untimely exonuclease digestion of DNA in cells by inhibiting the binding of exonuclease III to nicks and small gaps. Kamashev and Rouviere-Yaniv (20Kamashev D. Rouviere-Yaniv J. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 6527-6535Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar) showed that inhibition of exonuclease III activity by HU protein was only observed with DNA containing nicks. However, HU protein did not protect intact linear DNA from exonuclease III digestion, even at very high HU protein concentrations (20Kamashev D. Rouviere-Yaniv J. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 6527-6535Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Earlier, we showed that the human KU70/80 complex inhibited the rate of removal of DHU by human endonuclease III (15Hashimoto M. Donald C.D. Yannone S.M. Chen D.J. Roy R. Kow Y.W. J. Biol.

Inhibition was only observed when the DNA substrate contained a DHU that was close to and opposite a nick. Because HU protein also binds tightly to DNA containing a nick, it is thus expected that, like human KU protein, HU protein might also inhibit the endonuclease III activity. Fig. 1 shows the effect of increasing HU protein concentrations on the endonuclease III activity. Two DNA substrates were used in this experiment: duplex N, which contained a nick opposite and in close proximity to a DHU, and duplex L, which contains only a DHU. When duplex L was used as a substrate, increasing the amount of HU protein had no effect on the activity of E. coli endonuclease III (Fig. 1, panel A). However, when duplex N was used as the substrate, increasing the amount of HU protein led to a significant inhibition of the endonuclease III activity (Fig. 1, panel B). At 400 nm of HU protein, greater than 75% inhibition of endonuclease III activity was observed. This is comparable with the inhibition of E. coli exonuclease III activity by HU; at 400 nm HU inhibited ∼50% of the exonuclease activity of exonuclease III on nicked plasmid DNA (20Kamashev D. Rouviere-Yaniv J. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 6527-6535Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar).Fig. 1Effect of HU on endonuclease III activity. Panel A, 20 fmols of duplex L were incubated with 10 fmols of E. coli endonuclease III and an increasing amount of HU in a standard endonuclease III buffer at 37 °C for 10 min. The amount of endonuclease III-induced nicks was measured by electrophoresis on a 12.5% denaturing polyacrylamide gel. Duplex L incubated with HU only (♦) or with endonuclease III and HU (□). Panel B, 20 fmols of duplex N were incubated with 10 fmols of E. coli endonuclease III and an increasing amount of HU in a standard endonuclease III buffer at 37 °C for 10 min. Duplex N was incubated with HU only (♦) or with endonuclease III and HU (□).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To determine the effect that distances between the nick and DHU have on the inhibitory effect of HU on endonuclease III activity, five additional substrates were prepared with distances between the nick and DHU varied from 2, 4, 6, and 8 nucleotides lengths. Fig. 2 showed that HU exerted its maximum inhibitory effect when the nick was 2 nucleotides from the base lesion DHU. At 400 nm of HU protein, 50% of endonuclease III activity was inhibited when the nick was 2 nucleotides away, either 3′ or 5′ from DHU. When the nick was 4, 6, and 8 nucleotides away from DHU, inhibition of endonuclease III activity by HU was observed to be about 35, 22, and 12%, respectively.Fig. 2Effect of distance between the nick and DHU on the inhibitory effect of HU on endonuclease III activity. 20 fmols of duplex DNA containing nicks that are 0, 2, 4, 6, and 8 nucleotides from DHU on the complementary strand were incubated with 10 fmols of E. coli endonuclease III and 400 nm of HU in a standard endonuclease III buffer at 37 °C for 10 min. The amount of endonuclease III-induced nicks was measured by electrophoresis on a 12.5% denaturing polyacrylamide gel. Under the reaction condition used, endonuclease III activity on control DNA (CON) was 14.8 fmols of nick per 10 min (100%).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Effect of HU on DNA Polymerase I Activity—To have sequential repair of closely opposed lesions, it is necessary that repair synthesis catalyzed by DNA polymerase I (Pol I) be carried out unimpeded on the DNA strand containing the newly generated nick, whereas the cleavage activity of endonuclease III on the opposing lesion is inhibited by HU protein. It is therefore expected that concentrations of HU protein that inhibit endonuclease III activity will have little effect on the activity of Pol I. The effect of increasing concentrations of HU protein on Pol I activity was examined by using duplex N with the 35-mer 5′-end-labeled with 32P. DNA synthesis, or DNA polymerase activity was measured by the rate of extension of the 5′-end-labeled 35-mer to the full-length 56-mer. Because E. coli Pol I contains both 3′-5′ and 5′-3′ exonuclease activity, the amount of Pol I used for this experiment was chosen by determining the amount of Pol I that will give a good rate of DNA synthesis but little degradation of labeled primer. Fig. 3 shows a titration of the amount of Pol I used in the competing reactions of primer extension and degradation. It was found that under the reaction conditions used, 0.01–0.05 units of Pol I gave an optimum rate of primer extension with little degradation of the primer (Fig. 3, lanes 6–8). However, higher concentrations of Pol I led to substantial degradation of the labeled 35-mer (Fig. 3, lanes 2–5). Based on these data, the effect of HU protein on the nick translation was studied with 0.01 units of DNA Pol I. Fig. 4 shows that increasing concentrations of HU protein (up to 400 nm) had little inhibitory effect on the Pol I nick translation-DNA synthesis activity (Fig. 4, panel A, lanes 5–8). Using 0.01 units of Pol I, a 10 min reaction converted 45% of the substrate to the expected 56-mer full-length product (Fig. 4, panel B). The extent of nick translation catalyzed by Pol I was little affected, even in the presence of 400 nm of HU protein (Fig. 4, panel B). Recent studies showed that in the presence of poly (ADP-ribose) DNA polymerase, the human polymerase β favors a strand displacement synthesis (24Prasad R. Lavrik O.I. Kim S.J. Kedar P. Yang X.P. Vande Berg B.J. Wilson S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 2411-2414Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Because Pol I can also carry out strand displacement DNA synthesis, it is thus of interest to find out whether, in the presence of protein, Pol I can shift from nick translation to strand displacement DNA synthesis. To do this, both the 35-mer and the 21-mer of duplex N were 5′-end-labeled with 32P. Fig. 5 shows the time course of the reaction with Pol I. At an early time interval (1 min after the addition of Pol I), 400 nm of HU showed a slight inhibition on the rate of formation of the full-length 56-mer (panels A and B, lane 1). In the presence of 400 nm HU, the 1 min reaction generated predominantly primer extension products that are shorter than the full-length product (panel B, lane 1). However, as the reaction progressed, most of the extended products were extended to become full-length 56-mer (panel B, lanes 2–9). However, the rate of degradation of the 5′ DNA strand (the labeled 21-mer) was not inhibited (the faster migrating species of all lanes of panels A and B). These data suggest that high concentration of HU only slightly slowed down the initial extension of the 35-mer and appeared to have little effect on the progression of the nick translation reaction. This was indicated by the rapid formation of the full-length product and the extent of the degradation of the labeled 21-mer. These data thus suggest that the presence of HU protein did not shift Pol I from the nick translation mode of DNA synthesis to strand displacement mode of DNA repair synthesis.Fig. 3Titration of E. coli DNA polymerase I activity. 20 fmols of duplex N containing a 5′-labeled 35-mer was incubated in a standard nick translation buffer with decreasing E. coli DNA Pol I concentration.

https://openalex.org/W1995979833,"The proliferation and survival of hematopoietic cells is strictly regulated by cytokine growth factors that act through receptors of the Type I cytokine receptor family, including erythropoietin (Epo) and its receptor, EpoR. Mitogenic signaling by these receptors depends on activation of Jak tyrosine kinases. However, other required components of this pathway have not been fully identified. In a screen for proteins that interact with EpoR and Jak2, we identified a novel member of the U-box family of ubiquitin ligases.

Also, endogenously expressed RUL was rapidly and transiently phosphorylated on serine after cytokine treatment of factor-dependent hematopoietic cells. Expression of ubiquitin ligase-deficient mutants of RUL inhibited Epo-induced expression of c-myc and bcl-2, two immediate-early genes normally associated with Epo-induced cell growth. Consistent with that finding, expression of mutant RUL also inhibited Epo-dependent proliferation and survival of factor-dependent cells. Together, these observations suggest that RUL is a required component of mitogenic signaling by EpoR.

The proliferation and survival of hematopoietic cell lineages is strictly governed by cytokine growth factors that utilize structurally related receptors of the Type I cytokine receptor family. The hematopoietic lineage in which a specific cytokine acts is determined by the expression pattern of its receptor. For example, erythropoietin (Epo), 1The abbreviations used are: Epo, erythropoietin; EpoR, erythropoietin receptor; E1, ubiquitin-activating enzyme; E2, ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme; E3, ubiquitin ligase; EGF, epidermal growth factor; Erk, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; FBS, fetal bovine serum; G-CSF, granulocyte-colony stimulating factor; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; GST, glutathione S-transferase; HA, hemagglutinin epitope; HGF, hepatocyte growth factor; IL, interleukin; RUL, receptor-associated ubiquitin ligase; PI 3-kinase, phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase; FBS, fetal bovine serum; wt, wild-type; eNOS, endothelial nitric-oxide synthase; siRNA, small interfering RNA. acting through its receptor, EpoR, is largely restricted to supporting the growth of developing erythroid cells, whereas IL-3 promotes the growth of a broad range of immature myeloid cell lineages expressing its receptor. Cells of these lineages exhibit an absolute dependence on their corresponding growth factors and undergo rapid G1 phase cell cycle arrest and apoptotic death in the absence of that growth factor. Thus, these cytokine receptors regulate signaling pathways that directly promote cell cycle progression and inhibit apoptosis. Type I cytokine receptors have universally been shown to mediate their activities through association with, and activation of, Jak family tyrosine kinases (1Ihle J.N. Nature. 1995; 377: 591-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (1145) Google Scholar, 2O'Shea J.J. Gadina M. Schreiber R.D. Cell. 2002; 109: S121-S131Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (952) Google Scholar). EpoR activates Jak2 through an interaction with its cytoplasmic domain proximal to the plasma membrane (3Witthuhn B.A. Quelle F.W. Silvennoinen O. Yi T. Tang B. Miura O. Ihle J.N.

Blood. 1994; 84: 1501-1507Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). All Epo-dependent responses, including proliferation, are abrogated by disrupting Jak2 activation (4Miura O. Nakamura N. Quelle F.W.

Chem. 1994; 269: 21411-21414Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). EpoR can also activate other well characterized signaling intermediates, including components of the Ras pathway, Stat transcription factors, and PI 3-kinase (1Ihle J.N. Nature. 1995; 377: 591-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (1145) Google Scholar). In several instances, functional outcomes have been assigned to activation of these signaling pathways. For example, Epo-induced activation of Stat5 has been reported to enhance expression of the anti-apoptotic gene, bcl-X L, and thereby enhance survival of erythroid cells (6Bunting K.D. Bradley H.L. Hawley T.S. Moriggl R. Sorrentino B.P. Ihle J.N. Blood. 2002; 99: 479-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 7Socolovsky M. Fallon A.E.J. Wang S. Brugnara C. Lodish H.F. Cell. 1999; 98: 181-191Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (618) Google Scholar). Activation of PI 3-kinase is required to override checkpoints in cell cycle progression, and, as such, it promotes proliferation of cells suffering various forms of stress (8Henry M.K. Lynch J.T.

Biol. 2001; 21: 6113-6121Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Despite these identified functions, however, EpoR mutants lacking domains required for Stat5, Ras, and PI 3-kinase activation continue to promote survival and proliferation of factor-dependent hematopoietic cells (10Quelle F.W.

Ney P.A. Ihle J.N. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 3156-3166Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Similar correlations have been derived from analysis of other cytokine receptors, including the receptor for IL-3 (12Quelle F.W. Sato N. Witthuhn B.A. Inhorn R.C. Eder M. Miyajima A. Griffin J.D. Ihle J.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 4335-4341Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 13Wang D. Stravopodis D. Teglund S. Kitazawa J. Ihle J.N. Mol. Cell.

Thus, Jak activation represents the only identified cytokine receptor-induced activity that is absolutely required to promote survival and proliferation. Although the signaling intermediates downstream of Jak2 in Epo-induced growth and survival signals remain to be identified, several immediate-early gene targets have been linked to this signaling pathway. For instance, the membrane-proximal cytoplasmic domain of EpoR required for Jak2 activation and cell growth also mediates induced transcription of the immediate-early genes, c-myc and pim-1 (10Quelle F.W. Wang D. Nosaka T. Thierfelder W.E. Stravopodis D. Weinstein Y. Ihle J.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1622-1631Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). This is consistent with the previous observation that forced expression of both c-myc and pim-1 cooperate to render cells factor-independent for growth (15van Lohuizen M. Verbeek S. Krimpenfort P. Domen J. Saris C. Radasz-kiewicz T. Berns A. Cell. 1989; 56: 673-682Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar). Thus, transcriptional activation of c-myc and pim-1 are relevant targets of a growth signal mediated by EpoR. In keeping with its ability to inhibit p53-dependent apoptosis, Epo induces expression of anti-apoptotic genes, bcl-2 and bcl-X L, through the membrane-proximal domain of EpoR (16Silva M. Grillot D. Benito A. Richard C. Nunez G. Fernandez-Luna J.L. Blood. 1996; 88: 1576-1582Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 17Quelle F.W. Wang J. Feng J. Wang D. Cleveland J.L. Ihle J.N. Zambetti G.P. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1099-1107Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Thus, bcl-2 and bcl-X L are likely transcriptional targets of the survival signal initiated by a minimally active EpoR. Signaling pathways activated by Type I cytokine receptors are subject to negative regulation by several mechanisms, including inhibition of Jak activity by phosphatases, and inhibited activation of Stats by PIAS and SOCS proteins (18Hilton D.J. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 1999; 55: 1568-1577Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). Cytokine signaling may also be influenced by protein turnover mediated by proteasome-dependent degradation of receptors, Jaks, and Stats (19Verdier F. Walrafen P. Hubert N. Chretien S.

EMBO J. 2000; 19: 392-399Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Targeted degradation of these proteins can, in part, be mediated through recruitment of ubiquitin conjugating complexes associated with the SOCS-box of SOCS proteins (23Ungureanu D. Saharinen P. Junttila I. Hilton D.J. Silvennoinen O. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 3316-3326Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). Ubiquitination of cellular proteins is mediated by a multienzyme system (24Hershko A. Ciechanover A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 425-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (6952) Google Scholar, 25Pickart C.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 503-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (2942) Google Scholar). The first step is the formation of a thiol ester bond between the carboxyl terminus of ubiquitin and a ubiquitin-activating enzyme (E1). This is an ATP-dependent reaction resulting in release of AMP and PPi. The activated ubiquitin is then transferred to a ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme (E2). Ubiquitin ligase (E3) then mediates transfer of the activated ubiquitin from the E2 to lysine residues on the target protein. In this process, the ubiquitin ligase is principally responsible for selecting the protein target for ubiquitination. In mammalian cells, the identified components of ubiquitination cascades include a single E1, several E2s, and a large and growing number of E3s. Enzymes contributing ubiquitin ligase activity now comprise several protein families defined by retention of conserved domains, including HECT (homologous to EG-AP carboxyl terminus) domains, RING fingers, and the recently identified U-box (26Aravind L. Koonin E.V. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: R132-R134Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar). The conjugation of ubiquitin to cellular proteins regulates a broad range of cellular functions (25Pickart C.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 503-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (2942) Google Scholar, 27Pickart C.M. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 499-504Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar). Among the best characterized of these is the proteasome-dependent degradation of polyubiquitinated proteins. This result is associated with the formation of polyubiquitin chains linked through lysine 48 of the ubiquitin subunits. For example, EGF receptor internalization and degradation is regulated by polyubiquitination mediated by the RING finger protein, c-Cbl (28Levkowitz G. Waterman H. Ettenberg S.A. Katz M. Tsygankov A.Y. Alroy I. Lavi S. Iwai K. Reiss Y. Ciechanover A. Lipkowitz S. Yarden Y. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 1029-1040Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (836) Google Scholar, 29Waterman H. Levkowitz G. Alroy I. Yarden Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22151-22154Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). Alternatively, polyubiquitin chains linked through lysine 63 of the ubiquitin subunits have been associated with modification of protein function rather than degradation. For example, NF-κB activation by tumor necrosis factor-α receptors is mediated through the RING finger protein, Traf6. This is initiated through a cascade in which Traf6 is polyubiquitinated with chains linked through lysine 63 (30Deng L. Wang C. Spencer E. Yang L.Y. Braun A. You J.X. Slaughter C. Pickart C. Chen Z.J. Cell. 2000; 103: 351-361Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1524) Google Scholar). Polyubiquitinated Traf6 then mediates activation of the serine kinase, Tak1, which then phosphorylates and activates the IκB kinase (31Wang C. Deng L. Hong M. Akkaraju G.R. Inoue J. Chen Z.J.J. Nature. 2001; 412: 346-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (1651) Google Scholar). Phosphorylated IκB is then targeted for lysine 48-linked polyubiquitination and subsequent proteolytic degradation, allowing the activation of the NF-κB transcription factor. Thus, ubiquitination of receptors and signaling proteins can exert either positive or negative influence on the activities of receptor-activated signaling pathways. In the present study, we identified a novel receptor-associated ubiquitin ligase, p33RUL. We show that RUL interacts with EpoR, mediates ubiquitination of EpoR, and is inducibly phosphorylated on serine in response to Epo treatment. Expression of RUL mutants that lack ubiquitin ligase activity specifically inhibits Epo-induced expression of c-myc and bcl-2 and inhibits Epo-dependent proliferation and survival of factor-dependent hematopoietic cells. We also show that RUL is phosphorylated in response to growth factors acting through non-cytokine receptors. Together, these observations suggest that RUL is a required component of Epo-dependent signaling and may function as a common regulator of mitogenic signaling pathways. Cloning of p33RUL—A bait construct for a yeast-3-hybrid screen was prepared consisting of the cytoplasmic domain of wild-type EpoR (32D'Andrea A.D. Lodish H.F. Wong G.G.

Yeast cells (strain Y190) harboring the EpoR·Jak2 bait plasmid were used to screen 1.2 × 107 clones from a MATCHMAKER human bone marrow cDNA library (Clontech) for growth on media lacking leucine, tryptophan, histidine, and methionine. Prey plasmids from positive colonies were isolated and screened for growth on deficient media when retransformed into fresh yeast with the EpoR·Jak2 bait plasmid but not without the bait plasmid. To assess the effect of Jak2 expression on interactions, positive colonies were grown on media lacking leucine and tryptophan with or without methionine. Colonies were transferred to paper filters, permeabilized by freezing, and assayed for expression of the β-galactosidase reporter gene product by formation of blue color when incubated with 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-galactopyranoside (X-gal).

Mutant forms of the RUL cDNA were prepared that converted codon 49 from serine to alanine (RUL-S49A), or codon 186 from proline to alanine (RUL-P186A). An amino-terminal truncation of RUL (RUL-NT) was prepared containing a translation start site at codon 122 of the RUL open reading frame. Wild-type and mutant RUL cDNAs were cloned in-frame with the GST tag in the plasmid pACGHLT (BD Pharmingen) for preparation of baculovirus expression vectors, as previously described (12Quelle F.W.

For expression in mammalian cells, RUL cDNAs were cloned into pXM or the ponasterone-inducible expression vector, pIND (Invitrogen). An epitope tag was incorporated into RUL-pIND constructs to allow expressed proteins to be distinguished from endogenous RUL. A murine ubiquitin cDNA was obtained by reverse transcription-PCR from myeloid DA3 cells. This ubiquitin cDNA was prepared with a myc epitope tag at the amino-terminal end of the open reading frame and was cloned into the pXM expression vector. Cell Lines and Culture Conditions—32D cells expressing EpoR (8Henry M.K. Lynch J.T. Eapen A.K. Quelle F.W. Blood. 2001; 98: 834-841Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) and NFS-60 cells (34Mizuno K. Higuchi O. Ihle J.N. Nakamura T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 194: 178-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) have been described, and both were maintained in RPMI 1640 media plus 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and recombinant murine IL-3 (70 pg/ml). Human TF-1 cells (ATCC) were maintained in RPMI medium plus 10% FBS and human granulocyte-macrophage/colony-stimulating factor (5 ng/ml). COS7 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium plus 10% FBS. Transient transfection of COS7 cells was achieved using LipofectAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen) as directed by the manufacturer. Stable clones expressing EpoR·HA or RUL constructs were prepared by electroporation of plasmids into 32D cells. 32D-EpoR·HA cells were selected for their ability to grow in 5 units/ml Epo and subcloned by dilution. pIND-RUL plasmids were co-transfected with pVgRXR (Invitrogen). Transfected cells were selected in G418 (1 mg/ml) plus Zeocin (1 mg/ml) and were subcloned by dilution. Clonal cell lines were screened by Western blotting for expression of epitope-tagged RUL proteins when cultured in 6 μm ponasterone for 24 h. Growth analyses were performed on at least three different clones expressing RUL-wt or RUL-NT and one RUL-S49A-expressing clone. It is noteworthy that establishing clones expressing RUL-S49A has been extremely difficult, presumably due to the potent growth inhibitory effect of this construct in combination with low level basal expression from the ponasterone-inducible system. Growth Factor Stimulations—For stimulation experiments, cells were washed free of cytokine and were cultured in media plus 10% FBS for 4 h prior to stimulation with Epo (10 units/ml), IL-3 (2 ng/ml), G-CSF (10 ng/ml), or HGF (200 ng/ml). In experiments assaying RUL phosphorylation, cells were cultured in phosphate-free RPMI 1640 plus 10% FBS and [32P]phosphorous (0.5 mCi/ml) for 2 h prior to growth factor treatment. Cell lines harboring inducible RUL expression constructs were treated with or without 6 μm ponasterone for 20 h prior to stimulation with growth factors. In Vitro Ubiquitination—To prepare proteins for analysis in ubiquitination reactions, insect Sf9 cells were infected with baculovirus encoding GST-RUL fusion proteins containing a thrombin-cleavable linker. Infected cells were lysed in NG buffer (0.5% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol, 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 0.1 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, phosphatase inhibitors, and protease inhibitors), and GST fusion proteins were precipitated with glutathione-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences). Precipitated proteins were washed and eluted by digestion with thrombin (50 units/ml; Sigma) in phosphate-buffered saline for 16 h at 4 °C. Eluted fractions were assayed for protein content using the BCA protein assay (Pierce), and the presence of equivalent amounts of full-length wild-type or mutant RUL in purified preparations was confirmed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. Ubiquitination reactions were performed with 15 μg of purified wild-type or mutant RUL in a buffer containing 40 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 5 mm MgCl2,1mm dithiothreitol, 10 mm ATP, protease inhibitors, and 0.5 μg/μl GST-ubiquitin (Calbiochem). The reactions were initiated by adding 5 μl of fraction II rabbit reticulocyte lysate (Calbiochem) that had been pre-treated with 5 μm ubiquitin-aldehyde. Reactions were incubated for 2 h at 37 °C, and products were precipitated with glutathione-Sepharose. Precipitated proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and Western blotted with anti-RUL antibodies. Immunoprecipitation and Western Blotting—After growth factor stimulation, cells were lysed in NG buffer plus 60 mm octyl-β-d-glucopyranoside and N-ethylmaleimide. Cell lysates (3 × 107 cell equivalents) were immunoprecipitated with specific antibodies plus Protein A-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences). Where indicated, the p33RUL-immunizing peptide or irrelevant peptide was added to cell lysates (100 μg/ml) during immunoprecipitations. Precipitated proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Osmonics). Alternatively, cell lysates (5 × 105 cell equivalents) were directly separated by SDS-PAGE. Membranes were probed with specific antibodies and visualized by chemiluminescence (Lumi-Light, Roche Applied Science) as directed by the manufacturer. Antibodies specific for p33RUL were obtained by immunizing rabbits with a keyhole limpet hemocyanin-coupled peptide derived from the carboxyl-terminal 13 amino acids of human p33RUL. Specific antibodies were purified from rabbit serum on an affinity column prepared with the immunizing peptide. Other immunological reagents used were antiserum-specific for Stat5A and Stat5B (10Quelle F.W. Wang D. Nosaka T. Thierfelder W.E. Stravopodis D. Weinstein Y. Ihle J.N. Mol. Cell.

RNA Isolation and Northern Blotting—Total RNA was prepared by TRIzol (Invitrogen) extraction from cells stimulated with or without Epo (10 units/ml) for 2 h. Total RNA (20 μg) was separated on agarose gels and transferred to Hybond N+ membranes (Amersham Biosciences). Membranes were screened with 32P-labeled cDNA probes for c-myc, pim-1, bcl-2, bcl-X L, β-actin, and GAPDH, as previously described (10Quelle F.W. Wang D. Nosaka T. Thierfelder W.E. Stravopodis D.

For each transcript, mRNA levels were measured on a PhosphorImager (Amersham Biosciences) and were normalized to GAPDH or β-actin levels as a control for loading. The percent change in Epo-induced levels between cells treated with or without ponasterone was calculated. The calculated change for cells expressing RUL-wt or RUL-NT were averaged from four experiments and compared using a two-tailed Student's t test. Significant differences were indicated by p values ≤ 0.05. siRNA Reagents—siRNA targeting constructs were prepared using the Silencer siRNA construction kit (Ambion) according to the directions of the manufacturer. The RUL siRNA used in Fig. 4B is derived from nucleotides 94–114 of the murine RUL cDNA and resulted in the most efficient reduction of endogenous RUL proteins in COS7 cells among four candidate siRNA constructs that were tested. A GAPDH siRNA was supplied with the Silencer siRNA kit and was used as a control for suppression of a gene unrelated to p33RUL. A Novel EpoR Interacting Protein Is a Member of the U-box Family of Ubiquitin Ligases—To identify novel signaling intermediates interacting with EpoR, a yeast-3-hybrid experiment was performed with a bait construct containing the cytoplasmic domain of EpoR and a separate expression cassette encoding wild-type Jak2. Yeast cells harboring the EpoR·Jak2 bait plasmid were used to screen a human bone marrow cDNA library, and a single clone survived re-screening when transformed into fresh yeast harboring the bait construct. In yeast containing a β-galactosidase reporter, this clone mediated formation of blue colonies when co-expressed with the EpoR·Jak2 bait plasmid (not shown). Suppression of Jak2 expression in these colonies inhibited, but did not abolish, expression of the β-galactosidase reporter and formation of blue colonies. Thus, the protein product of the clone appeared to preferentially associate with the EpoR cytoplasmic domain in the presence of Jak2. When sequenced, the cloned cDNA was found to contain a complete open reading frame predicted to encode a 301-amino acid protein with an expected size of 33 kDa (p33). The sequence was identical to a protein recently identified in a yeast-2-hybrid screen for eNOS-interacting proteins, NOSIP (35Dedio J. Konig P. Wohlfart P. Schroeder C. Kummer W. Muller-Esterl W. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 79-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Although not previously identified, we found that the amino acid sequence of this protein contained significant homology to the U-box family of ubiquitin ligases (Fig. 1A). The U-box is a modified form of the RING Finger domain that lacks metalchelating cysteines and histidines (26Aravind L. Koonin E.V. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: R132-R134Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar). Like the RING Finger, the U-box is thought to form a structure consisting of three β-sheets and a single α-helix, which would be stabilized by salt bridges instead of chelated metal ions. The p33 U-box appears to be an atypical member of this family, because it is split into two halves separated by 104 amino acids. These intervening amino acids reside within the predicted loop between the helix and the third sheet. Interestingly, secondary structure modeling programs (36Cuff J.A. Barton G.J. Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 1999; 34: 508-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (544) Google Scholar) predict that the helix beginning within the p33 U-box extends through the first 40 of the 104 intervening residues (Fig. 1B). Otherwise, the p33 U-box shows very high homology to the consensus U-box sequence, with a significant expectation (E) value of 6 × 10–11 obtained from the RPS-BLAST search (37Altschul S.F. Madden T.L. Schaffer A.A. Zhang J.H. Zhang Z. Miller W. Lipman D.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3389-3402Crossref PubMed Scopus (60202) Google Scholar). Because the U-box family has only recently been identified, the structural requirements of this functional domain are not fully defined. Thus, it is not clear how the 104-amino acid intervening domain of the p33 U-box may affect its potential function as a ubiquitin ligase. Importantly, conserved amino acids that were reported to inactivate U-box proteins when mutated (38Hatakeyama S. Yada M. Matsumoto M. Ishida N. Nakayama K.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 33111-33120Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (477) Google Scholar, 39Pringa E. Martinez-Noel G. Muller U. Harbers K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 19617-19623Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) are retained in the p33 U-box (Fig. 1A). To confirm the identity of p33 as a ubiquitin ligase, the ability of p33 to ubiquitinate itself in an in vitro reaction was assessed. As specificity controls, p33 point mutations were prepared converting essential U-box residues serine 49 or proline 186 to alanine. Wild-type and mutant cDNAs were expressed as GST fusion proteins in insect Sf9 cells and purified by glutathione-Sepharose precipitation and thrombin cleavage of the GST linker.

Here we report that an increase in free Ca2+ concentration triggered the release of up to 41 ± 3% of the intracellular Ca2+ stores in permeabilized A7r5 (embryonic rat aorta) cells with an EC50 of 700 nm. This type of Ca2+-induced Ca2+ release (CICR) was neither mediated by inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptors nor by ryanodine receptors, because it was not blocked by heparin, 2-aminoethoxydiphenyl borate, xestospongin C, ruthenium red, or ryanodine. ATP dose-dependently stimulated the CICR mechanism, whereas 10 mm MgCl2 abolished it. CICR was not affected by exogenously added calmodulin (CaM), but CaM1234, a Ca2+-insensitive CaM mutant, strongly inhibited the CICR mechanism. Other proteins of the CaM-like neuronal Ca2+-sensor protein family such as Ca2+-binding protein 1 and neuronal Ca2+ sensor-1 were equally potent for inhibiting the CICR. Removal of endogenous CaM, using a CaM-binding peptide derived from the ryanodine receptor type-1 (amino acids 3614–3643) prevented subsequent activation of the CICR mechanism. A similar CICR mechanism was also found in 16HBE14o-(human bronchial mucosa) cells. We conclude that A7r5 and 16HBE14o-cells express a novel type of CICR mechanism that is silent in normal resting conditions due to inhibition by CaM but becomes activated by a Ca2+-dependent dissociation of CaM. This CICR mechanism, which may be regulated by members of the family of neuronal Ca2+-sensor proteins, may provide an additional route for Ca2+ release that could allow amplification of small Ca2+ signals.

Pharmacol. 2002; 447: 141-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Cells generate Ca2+ signals through both intracellular (mainly the endoplasmic/sarcoplasmic reticulum) and extracellular Ca2+ sources. Regulation of these Ca2+ signals via a variety of Ca2+ channels, expressed either in the plasma membrane or in the membranes of intracellular stores, is thereby essential. Ca2+ fluxes from extracellular and intracellular Ca2+ sources do not occur independently of each other. For example, the intracellular Ca2+ store content regulates Ca2+ entry from the extracellular medium via capacitative Ca2+ entry (3Putney Jr., J.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 14669-14671Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 4Putney Jr., J.W. McKay R.R. Bioessays. 1999; 21: 38-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar), whereas Ca2+ released by one channel can alter the activity of other channels. These are all well documented mechanisms whereby Ca2+ can exert important effects on its own activity. The most important type of regulation is represented by the various mechanisms that may lead to the characteristic bell-shaped dependence of intracellular Ca2+ channels on Ca2+ itself (5Berridge M.J.

This may in principle be due to direct interaction with Ca2+ or indirectly via Ca2+-sensor proteins such as calmodulin (CaM). The inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor (IP3R) and the ryanodine receptor (RyR) are the two major families of intracellular Ca2+ release channels that have been characterized. Both types of intracellular channels are regulated in a complex way by Ca2+ and CaM. CaM has been demonstrated to affect the activity of RyRs in both a stimulatory and an inhibitory manner (10Xiong L.W. Newman R.A. Rodney G.G. Thomas O. Zhang J.Z. Persechini A.

For the IP3R, CaM clearly exerts an inhibitory effect, but the precise mechanism is not yet understood (12Taylor C.W. Laude A.J.

Stimulation is important for the mechanism of Ca2+-induced Ca2+ release (CICR), which allows amplification and regenerative propagation of intracellular Ca2+ signals. CICR seems to be an operational mode of both IP3Rs and RyRs, and it is clearly a key feature of intracellular Ca2+ signaling (21Albrecht M.A. Colegrove S.L. Hongpaisan J. Pivovarova N.B. Andrews S.B.

J. 2002; 361: 605-611Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) identified a novel CICR mechanism in permeabilized hepatocytes that responded to modest increases in [Ca2+]c. Polycystin-2, the product of the gene mutated in type-2 autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease and a prototypical member of a subfamily of the transient receptor potential channel superfamily (TRP), is expressed abundantly in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) (24Koulen P. Cai Y. Geng L. Maeda Y. Nishimura S. Witzgall R. Ehrlich B.E. Somlo S. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 191-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (560) Google Scholar). It was shown recently that polycystin-2 expressed in the ER of epithelial cells is a Ca2+-activated channel that is permeable for divalent cations. Increased levels of intracellular Ca2+ activated polycystin-2-mediated release of Ca2+ from intracellular stores. Recent data also suggested that activation of the ER-associated vanilloid receptor 1 (VR1), a member of the TRP family, by capsaicin binding resulted in Ca2+ mobilization from intracellular stores. This raises the possibility that VR1 may also function as an intracellular Ca2+ release channel (27Liu M. Liu M.C. Magoulas C. Priestley J.V. Willmott N.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 278: 5462-5472Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 28Turner H. Fleig A. Stokes A. Kinet J.P. Penner R. Biochem. J. 2003; 371: 341-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). In the present study we have identified a novel CICR mechanism in permeabilized A7r5 cells, a permanent cell line derived from embryonic rat aorta. We identified a CICR mechanism that was mediated by neither the IP3R nor the RyR. Moreover, we found that this CICR mechanism could be inhibited by CaM1234, a Ca2+-insensitive CaM mutant, and by different members of the superfamily of CaM-like Ca2+-binding proteins. Our data suggest that the CICR mechanism described here may represent a novel type of release channel, which is silent at low [Ca2+]c due to inhibition by bound apoCaM and which becomes activated by the Ca2+-dependent dissociation of CaM. This CICR mechanism may provide an additional pathway for intracellular Ca2+ release and could play an important role in amplifying Ca2+ signals generated by other Ca2+ release channels. 45Ca2+ Fluxes—A7r5 cells, which are derived from embryonic rat aorta, were obtained from the American Tissue Type Culture Collection CRL 1444 (Bethesda, MD). Cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 3.8 mm l-glutamine, 0.9% (v/v) non-essential amino acids, 85 IU/ml penicillin, 85 μg/ml streptomycin, and 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.4). For 16HBE14o-(human bronchial mucosa) and mouse embryonal fibroblast cells a mixture of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and Ham's F-12 medium was used and for LLC-PK1 cells minimal essential medium α was used. 45Ca2+ fluxes were performed on saponin-permeabilized cells. The cells were seeded in 12-well clusters (Costar, MA) at a density of ∼4 × 104 cm–2. Experiments were carried out on confluent monolayers of cells (3 × 105 cells/well) between the 7th and 9th days after plating. Cells were permeabilized by incubating them for 10 min with a solution containing 120 mm KCl, 30 mm imidazole-HCl (pH 6.8), 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm ATP, 1 mm EGTA, and 20 μg ml–1 saponin at 25 °C. The non-mitochondrial Ca2+ stores were loaded for 45 min at 37 °C in 120 mm KCl, 30 mm imidazole-HCl (pH 6.8), 5 mm MgCl2, 5 mm ATP, 0.44 mm EGTA, 10 mm NaN3, and 150 nm free 45Ca2+ (28 μCi ml–1). The cells were then washed twice with 1 ml of efflux medium containing 120 mm KCl, 30 mm imidazole-HCl (pH 6.8), 1 mm EGTA, and 10 μm thapsigargin. Thapsigargin was added to block the ER Ca2+ pumps during subsequent additions of Ca2+. The efflux medium was replaced every 2 min during 18 min, and the efflux was performed at 37 °C. The additions of 40Ca2+ and IP3 are indicated in the legends of the figures. Free [Ca2+] was calculated by the Cabuf program (available at ftp.cc.kuleuven.ac.be/pub/droogmans/cabuf.zip) and based on the stability constants given by Fabiato and Fabiato (29Fabiato A. Fabiato F. J. Physiol. 1979; 75: 463-505PubMed Google Scholar). At the end of the experiment the 45Ca2+ remaining in the stores was released by incubation with 1 ml of a 2% SDS solution for 30 min. Ca2+ release is plotted as the fractional loss, i.e. the amount of Ca2+ released in 2 min divided by the total store Ca2+ content at that time. The latter value was calculated by summing in retrograde order the amount of tracer remaining in the cells at the end of the efflux and the amounts of tracer collected during the successive time intervals. In experiments performed to exclude 40Ca2+/45Ca2+ exchange in Fig. 2, cells were loaded during 45 min in loading buffer, containing 4 mm EGTA and 680 μm total CaCl2, resulting in 285 nm free [Ca2+] and a specific activity for Ca2+ of 28 μCi ml–1. After 45 min, the loading buffer was replaced for 2 min by a loading buffer with an EGTA concentration of 0.76 mm and supplemented with thapsigargin, to maintain the same 40Ca2+/45Ca2+ ratio but resulting in an increase in free [Ca2+] to 10 μm. Efflux was then further performed in Ca2+-free efflux buffer. Peptide Synthesis—RyR1 peptide (amino acids 3614–3643) (30Rodney G.G. Moore C.P. Williams B.Y. Zhang J.Z. Krol J. Pedersen S.E.

Cloning of sCaBp1 and lCaBp1—Mouse CaBP1 cDNA was cloned from mouse cerebellum RNA. Poly(A)+ RNA from mouse cerebellum was prepared using the Micro-FastTrack kit (Invitrogen, CA). Random primed first strand cDNA was synthesized from 1 μg of RNA using avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase. Reverse transcription-PCR was performed with forward primer 5′-GCCAGCCATATGGGCAACTGCGTCAAGTCGCC-3′ and reverse primer 5′-GCGGGCAGCCTCGAGGCGAGACATCATCCGGAC-3′. The forward primer contained the site for NdeI (CATATG), and the reverse primer contained the site for XhoI (CTCGAG). PCR fragments of both isoforms, the short (sCaBp1) and long (lCaBp1) form, were then cloned into the NdeI-XhoI site of the pET21b/+ vector (Novagen), yielding an expression vector for a His6-tagged sCaBp1 and lCaBp1. Expression and Purification of Recombinant Proteins—pET-sCaBP1 and pET-lCaBP1 were transformed in BL21 Escherichia coli cells, grown to mid-exponential phase, and induced with 0.75 mm isopropyl-1-thiol-β-d-galactopyranoside for4hat28 °C. Cells were centrifuged for 10 min, and pellets were then resuspended in lysis buffer containing 50 mm NaH2PO4, pH 7.0, 300 mm NaCl, 10 mm imidazole, 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 0.8 mm benzamidine, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μm leupeptin, 1 μm pepstatin A, and 75 nm aprotinin. This cell suspension was then lysed by sonication at 20 kHz, nine times for 10 s using a probe sonicator (MSE Ltd., Crawley, Surrey, UK). 1 ml of 50% nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid (Qiagen) slurry was added to 4 ml of cleared lysate and gently mixed by shaking at 4 °C for 60 min. The lysate-nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid mixture was loaded on a column and washed with 2 volumes of lysis buffer supplemented with 10 mm imidazole. Finally, the recombinant protein was eluted with four times 0.5-ml elution buffer (lysis buffer containing 250 mm imidazole). The protein was eluted in the second and third elution fractions. Recombinant CaM and CaM1234 were expressed and purified as described in a previous study (31Sienaert I. Nadif Kasri N. Vanlingen S. Parys J.B. Callewaert G. Missiaen L. de Smedt H. Biochem.

GST-NCS-1 and GST-NCS-1E120Q were expressed and purified as described previously (32Zhao X. Varnai P. Tuymetova G. Balla A. Toth Z.E. Oker-Blom C. Roder J. Jeromin A. Balla T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 40183-40189Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Increase in [Ca2+]c Stimulates Ca2+ Release from Intracellular Stores—In A7r5 cells (embryonic smooth muscle) Ca2+ release from internal stores, mainly from the ER, occurs to a large extent via production of the second messenger IP3. In this permeabilized cell system a maximal effective dose of IP3 can release about 95% of the intracellular Ca2+ content (33Missiaen L. Declerck I. Droogmans G. Plessers L. De Smedt H. Raeymaekers L. Casteels R. J. Physiol. 1990; 427: 171-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Here, the non-mitochondrial stores of permeabilized A7r5 cells were loaded to steady state with 45Ca2+ and then incubated in a non-labeled efflux medium containing 10 μm thapsigargin. The loss of Ca2+ from the stores under these conditions is plotted as the fractional loss in function of time (Fig. 1). After 10 min the cells were challenged with 1 μm IP3 (circles), as indicated by the bar. As previously documented in detail, using the same 45Ca2+ flux technique (17Bootman M.D. Missiaen L.

J. 1997; 323: 123-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar), IP3 increased the rate of Ca2+ release (Fig. 1). In the same assay, cells challenged with 3 μm free 40Ca2+ (squares) also showed an increase in the rate of Ca2+ release. 3 μm free 40Ca2+ was able to release 25 ± 2% of the stored Ca2+. The total amount of releasable Ca2+ was measured by treating the cells with 5 μm ionophore A23187 (triangles). This activation of Ca2+ release upon elevation of the cytosolic [Ca2+]c has also previously been observed by others (15Finch E.A. Turner T.J. Goldin S.M. Science. 1991; 252: 443-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (673) Google Scholar, 38Missiaen L. De Smedt H. Droogmans G. Casteels R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 22961-22966Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), but it could not be excluded that it reflected 45Ca2+/40Ca2+ exchange without net transport (38Missiaen L. De Smedt H. Droogmans G. Casteels R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 22961-22966Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It is indeed important to emphasize that in this type of experiment the challenge by 3 μm40Ca2+ could have caused an exchange of 45Ca2+ for 40Ca2+. To exclude the contribution of 45Ca2+/40Ca2+ exchange we maintained the same 45Ca2+/40Ca2+ ratio during the loading and efflux phases and we changed the [EGTA] to alter the free [Ca2+] (Fig. 2). After incubation in loading buffer during 45 min, the cells were incubated for 2 min in the same loading buffer supplemented with thapsigargin and lowered [EGTA]. This resulted in a complete inhibition of the Ca2+ uptake via the sarcoplasmic/endoplasmic-reticulum Ca2+-ATPase (SERCA) and in a rise of the free [Ca2+] up to 10 μm, while maintaining the 45Ca2+/40Ca2+ ratio constant. Subsequently, the cells were incubated in Ca2+-free efflux medium. The traces in Fig. 2 illustrate how the Ca2+ content of the stores decreased during the 10-min incubation in the Ca2+-free efflux medium and show that the initial Ca2+ content was decreased by the rise in free [Ca2+] during the first 2 min subsequent to the loading. Cells incubated during 2 min in 10 μm free [Ca2+] medium showed a decrease in Ca2+ content of 27 ± 6% compared with cells that were not subjected to a [Ca2+] rise. This finding demonstrates that a decrease in the Ca2+ content was induced by 10 μm free Ca2+ without a change in the 45Ca2+/40Ca2+ ratio thereby excluding passive 45Ca2+/40Ca2+ exchange. CICR Is Neither IP 3 R- nor RyR-mediated—The two major classes of intracellular Ca2+ release channels are the IP3Rs and the RyRs. In A7r5 cells both IP3R1 (73%) and IP3R3 (26%) are expressed (39De Smedt H. Missiaen L. Parys J.B. Bootman M.D. Mertens L. Van Den Bosch L. Casteels R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21691-21698Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). No evidence has been found for a functional role of the RyR in A7r5 cells (33Missiaen L. Declerck I. Droogmans G. Plessers L. De Smedt H. Raeymaekers L. Casteels R. J. Physiol. 1990; 427: 171-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 40Bennett D.L. Cheek T.R. Berridge M.J. De Smedt H. Parys J.B.

IP3R1 and IP3R3 are both known to be regulated by increases in [Ca2+]c (9Parys J.B. Sienaert I. Vanlingen S. Callewaert G. De Smet P. Missiaen L. De Smedt H. Pochet R. Donato R. Haiech J. Heizmann C. Gerke V. Calcium: The Molecular Basis of Calcium Action in Biology and Medicine. Kluwer Academic Publishers, Norwell, MA2000: 179-190Google Scholar, 14Bezprozvanny I. Watras J. Ehrlich B.E.

Physiol. 1990; 95: 1103-1122Crossref PubMed Scopus (495) Google Scholar). We therefore investigated whether the CICR described here originated from the IP3-sensitive stores. Permeabilized cells were loaded with 45Ca2+ in the presence or absence of a saturating dose of IP3 (300 μm). Efflux was then performed in medium without added Ca2+. After 10 min cells were incubated for 2 min with 10 μm free 40Ca2+. No CICR was observed in cells that were loaded in the presence of IP3 (data not shown). This finding suggested that the CICR mechanism only occurred from the IP3-sensitive stores. Furthermore we looked whether this CICR mechanism was also restricted to the thapsigargin-sensitive stores. In permeabilized A7r5 cells 92% of the total Ca2+ uptake involved a thapsigargin-sensitive SERCA pump, and 8% was mediated by a thapsigargin-insensitive Ca2+-uptake mechanism (41Missiaen L. Vanoevelen J. Parys J.B. Raeymaekers L. De Smedt H. Callewaert G. Erneux C. Wuytack F. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 6898-6902Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Cells that were loaded in the presence of 10 μm thapsigargin were challenged with 10 μm free 40Ca2+. Also in this condition no CICR mechanism was observed (data not shown). Taken together, these results suggest that this CICR mode is only occurring from the thapsigargin and IP3-sensitive compartments of the ER. Heparin, 2-aminoethoxydiphenyl borate (2-APB) and xestospongin C (XeC) are the most used antagonists of the IP3R. In Fig. 3 it is shown that none of these components affected the fractional loss induced by 10 μm free 40Ca2+, revealing that the IP3R was not involved in this mechanism. Although there is no evidence for a functional RyR in A7r5 cells, we also used antagonists of the RyR to exclude any role of the RyR in this CICR mechanism. Fig. 3 illustrates that neither ruthenium red (RuRed) (100 μm) nor ryanodine (5 μm) had any effect on the fractional loss induced by 10 μm free 40Ca2+. Ca2+ release stimulated by sphingosine 1-phosphate (42Pyne S. Pyne N.J. Biochem. J. 2000; 349: 385-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (661) Google Scholar) and NAADP (43Genazzani A.A. Galione A. Biochem. J. 1996; 315: 721-725Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar) has been observed in a number of cell types. However, it is unlikely that one of these mechanisms mediated CICR in A7r5 cells, because NAADP-stimulated Ca2+ release was not modulated by Ca2+ (44Bak J. White P. Timar G. Missiaen L. Genazzani A.A. Galione A. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 751-754Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) and no sphingosine 1-phosphate or NAADP-stimulated Ca2+ release was observed in A7r5 cells under our assay conditions (data not shown). Characteristics of the Observed CICR—To further characterize the CICR mechanism in A7r5 cells, we measured its [Ca2+] dependence. The Ca2+ release as a function of increasing free [40Ca2+] was plotted in Fig. 4a. A maximally effective free [40Ca2+] of 10 μm stimulated release of 27 ± 4% of the stored 45Ca2+. The activation by Ca2+ occurred with an EC50 of 700 ± 30 nm and had a positive cooperativity, with a Hill coefficient of 1.9 ± 0.2. This means that a steep activation occurs within the physiological range of cytosolic Ca2+ levels (0.1–10 μm). Fig. 4b illustrates that the CICR mechanism was controlled by the level of store loading. Ca2+ stores from permeabilized A7r5 cells loaded to steady state with 45Ca2+ were incubated in Ca2+-free efflux medium, and their Ca2+ content was plotted as a function of time. 40Ca2+ (10 μm) was added either after 2 min (circles, full stores) or after 20 min (triangles, less filled stores). Application of 10 μm free 40Ca2+ was clearly less efficient to release 45Ca2+ from less filled stores. These results indicate that the CICR mechanism was controlled by the luminal [Ca2+]. In this respect the CICR mechanism shows the same dependence on the luminal Ca2+ content as described for IP3-induced Ca2+ release in those cells (34Missiaen L. De Smedt H. Droogmans G. Casteels R. Nature. 1992; 357: 599-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). Fig. 5a illustrates that Mg2+ dose-dependently blocked the CICR in A7r5 cells. The EC50 for this inhibition was 0.59 ± 0.04 mm. The inhibitory effect of Mg2+ was not due to the increase in osmolarity of the medium, because a similar increase in osmolarity by addition of 15 mm KCl instead of 10 mm MgCl2, did not inhibit the CICR (data not shown). Furthermore, CICR was stimulated by increasing the [ATP] in the absence of Mg2+ (Fig. 5b). Stimulation occurred with an EC50 of 320 ± 23 μm. By adding 1 mm ATP together with 10 μm free 40Ca2+, maximal Ca2+ release was increased from 27 ± 4% to 41 ± 3%. This indicates that in physiological conditions this CICR can release a significant fraction of the intracellular stores. Regulation of CICR by CaM-like Proteins—CaM is a ubiquitous regulator of most if not all types of Ca2+ channels, including the intracellular Ca2+ release channels. We therefore investigated the effect of CaM and CaM mutants on the CICR mechanism in A7r5 cells. CaM1234, which is CaM rendered Ca2+-insensitive by point mutations (45Peterson B.Z. DeMaria C.D. Adelman J.P. Yue D.T. Neuron. 1999; 22: 549-558Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (716) Google Scholar), has the ability to associate with apoCaM-binding sites on Ca2+ release channels (46Erickson M.G. Alseikhan B.A. Peterson B.Z. Yue D.T. Neuron. 2001; 31: 973-985Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar). In this way CaM1234 can prevent access to Ca2+/CaM effector sites, thereby eliminating Ca2+ regulation via CaM as the Ca2+ sensor. Recombinant CaM (10 μm)orCaM1234 (10 μm) was added together with 3 μm free 40Ca2+ to permeabilized cells loaded with 45Ca2+. Fig. 6a shows that exogenously added CaM had no effect on the Ca2+ release induced by 3 μm free 40Ca2+, whereas CaM1234 almost completely inhibited the CICR. CaM1234 inhibited the CICR with micromolar affinity (Fig. 6b). These data obtained with CaM and CaM1234 led us to hypothesize that Ca2+-free CaM (apoCaM) in resting conditions may be tethered to the protein responsible for the CICR. Binding of Ca2+ to the tethered CaM could then dissociate or dislocate CaM, which could provoke a conformational change thereby activating Ca2+ release from the intracellular stores. CaM1234 would render the system insensitive to activation by Ca2+. To know whether CaM needed to be mutated in all four EF-hands to fulfill its inhibitory role on this CICR mechanism, we also tested CaM"

Accordingly, it has been proposed that elements within the COOH terminus may determine substrate specificity of the EGFR tyrosine kinase (Decker, S. J., Alexander, C., and Habib, T. (1992) J. Biol.

To address this hypothesis, we analyzed in vitro the steady-state kinetic parameters for phosphorylation of several substrates by both wild-type EGFR and an oncogenic EGFR mutant (the ct1022 mutant) truncated at residue 1022. The substrates included: (i) a phospholipase C-γ fragment (residues 530–850); (ii) the 46-kDa isoform of the Shc adapter protein; (iii) a 13-residue peptide mimic for the region around the major autophosphorylation tyrosine and the Shc binding site (the Y1173 peptide); (iv) a poly(Glu,Tyr) 4:1 copolymer; and (v) the 8-residue peptide, angiotensin II. Our data demonstrate that the steady-state kinetic parameters for the ct1022 mutant differ from those of the wild-type enzyme, and the differences are substrate-dependent. These results support the concept that this oncogenic truncation/mutation alters EGFR substrate specificity, rather than causing a general alteration of activity. We performed the experiments using a non-radioactive fluorescence polarization assay that quantifies the degree of phosphorylation of peptide as well as natural substrates.

Beug H. Schlessinger J. EMBO J. 1985; 4: 3179-3182Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 15Maihle N.J. Kung H.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 948: 287-304PubMed Google Scholar). Cellular changes in phosphotyrosine levels may occur not only as a result of changes in the catalytic properties of the enzyme, but may also reflect alterations in the regulation of other kinases and/or phosphatases in addition to the possible changes in receptor internalization and dimerization already mentioned. For example, although cellular phosphorylation of caveolin-1 is more pronounced in cells expressing COOH-terminal truncated EGFR (9Kim Y.N. Wiepz G.J. Guadarrama A.G. Bertics P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7481-7491Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), whether the mutated EGFR directly phosphorylates this substrate remains unclear. Therefore, to precisely isolate the effects of an EGFR mutation on the tyrosine kinase activity, it was necessary to purify the mutant and compare its activity to that of wild-type enzyme in a biochemical assay. In this study, an in vitro fluorescence polarization (FP) assay (described below) has been used quantitatively to compare steady-state kinetic parameters of wild-type EGFR with those of the ct1022 mutant. FP measures molecular rotation occurring during the fluorescence lifetime, the period between excitation and emission of a fluorophore. Relatively small molecules tumble quickly in solution. When excited by plane-polarized light, these molecules emit light that is relatively depolarized. In contrast, larger molecules and complexes tumble more slowly in solution, and emit more highly polarized light (16Nasir M.S. Jolley M.E. Comb. Chem. High Throughput Screen. 1999; 2: 177-190PubMed Google Scholar). The FP competitive immunoassay involves the addition of a fluorescently labeled phosphopeptide tracer (a relatively small molecule) and an antibody (a relatively large molecule) specific for phosphorylated tyrosine to a kinase reaction. Initially, the phosphopeptide tracer binds to the antibody. As the kinase reaction proceeds, however, phosphorylated substrate binds to the antibody and displaces the tracer. Free fluorescent tracer possesses a lower polarization value than does antibody-bound tracer; therefore, displacing the fluorescent tracer decreases the polarization value. Changes in polarization can readily be monitored with a FP instrument (Fig. 1) (17Parker G.J. Law T.L. Lenoch F.J. Bolger R.E. J. Biomol. Screen. 2000; 5: 77-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar, 18Checovich W.J. Bolger R.E. Burke T. Nature. 1995; 375: 254-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). To determine whether the steady-state kinetic parameters for wild-type EGFR and for the ct1022 mutant would vary with the choice of substrate, five different substrates were employed: two synthetic peptide substrates, two natural substrates (the Shc adapter protein, and a 321-residue PLC-γ fragment containing the complete SH2-SH2-SH3 domains), and a poly(Glu,Tyr) 4:1 copolymer. Fig. 2 depicts the basic structural features of EGFR (3Wells A. Signal. 2000; 1: 4-10Google Scholar). A recently solved crystal structure of EGFR encompassing residues 672–998 suggests that for this enzyme, interaction of the COOH-terminal substrate tyrosines with the active site, rather than phosphorylation of the kinase domain “activation loop,” is important for regulating cellular processes (19Stamos J. Sliwkowski M.X. Eigenbrot C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 46265-46272Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (976) Google Scholar). Additionally, the structure reveals that Leu955 of the Leu955-Val956-Ile957 dimerization motif is closely associated with the kinase domain, and we therefore hypothesize that truncations in the COOH terminus may cause conformational changes that alter substrate specificity. In this paper, we used an FP competitive immunoassay to measure the amount of phosphorylated substrate produced in kinase reactions. We generated standard curves relating FP values to concentrations of phosphorylated forms of each substrate. In addition, we performed phosphorylation time course assays with EGFR and the ct1022 mutant for each of the five EGFR substrates described above at multiple substrate concentrations. We monitored the reaction progress using FP. We then determined the corresponding amount (pmol) of phosphorylated substrate generated at each time point using the standard curves for each substrate. We plotted the initial velocities resulting from these time course experiments as a function of substrate concentration and fitted the data to the Michaelis-Menten equation. We determined and compared the steady-state kinetic parameters for phosphorylation catalyzed by both wild-type EGFR and the ct1022 mutant for each substrate. Materials—EGFR was purified from A431 cells as described previously (20Hubler L. Leventhal P.S. Bertics P.J. Biochem. J. 1992; 281: 107-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), and the ct1022 mutant was purified similarly from B82L fibroblasts (9Kim Y.N. Wiepz G.J. Guadarrama A.G. Bertics P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7481-7491Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 21Li J. Lin M.L. Wiepz G.J. Guadarrama A.G. Bertics P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11209-11219Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The plasmid utilized for expressing the 46-kDa isoform of the Shc adapter protein (22Pelicci G. Lanfrancone L. Grignani F. McGlade J. Cavallo F. Forni G. Nicoletti I. Pawson T. Pelicci P.G. Cell. 1992; 70: 93-104Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1128) Google Scholar) was a generous gift from Professor Pier G. Pelicci, European Institute of Oncology, Milan, Italy. We inserted it into a pET vector (Novagen) to produce protein with an NH2-terminal His tag to facilitate purification. This construct was transformed into Rosetta (DE3) pLysS cells (Novagen). Cells were grown at 37 °C, induced with 0.1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside at an A 600 = 0.8, and subsequently grown for 3 h. Cells were lysed using a Branson sonicator, and the His-tagged Shc adapter protein was purified using a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid matrix (Qiagen) under nondenaturing conditions (wash buffer: 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 8.0), 300 mm NaCl, 20 mm imidazole; elution buffer: 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 8.0), 300 mm NaCl, 250 mm imidazole). The protein was equilibrated into 20 mm Hepes buffer (pH 7.4) with a PD-10 column (Amersham Biosciences) and quantified using Bradford reagent (Bio-Rad). FP Assay—We used PanVera's tyrosine kinase assay kit, green, for the FP assays. Polarization was monitored using either PanVera's Beacon™ 2000 fluorescence polarization instrument or the Tecan Ultra (490–485 nm excitation, 525–535 nm emission). Black round-bottom 96-well plates (DYNEX Technologies, Inc.) and 384-well plates (Cliniplate/Labsystems) were used with the Tecan Ultra. For the [γ-32P]ATP assay, Redivue [γ-32P]ATP was purchased from Amersham Biosciences, and Schleicher & Schuell Protran nitrocellulose membranes were used for filtration. Substrate Peptides—Peptides employed included angiotensin II and the Y1173 peptide, a 13-residue peptide mimic for the region around the Y1173 autophosphorylation site (TAENAEYLRVAPQ). The tyrosyl-phosphorylated version of angiotensin II was purchased from Calbio-chem at ≥98% purity. The tyrosyl-phosphorylated version of the Y1173 peptide was custom synthesized by the University of Wisconsin Biotechnology Center at ≥99% purity. Unphosphorylated forms of angiotensin II and the Y1173 peptide were purchased from the same vendors at ≥98 and 99% purity, respectively. Aqueous samples of these peptides were quantified by amino acid analysis at the Medical College of Wisconsin Protein/Nucleic Acid Facility. The poly(Glu,Tyr) 4:1 copolymer and ATP were purchased from Sigma, and a fragment of PLC-γ (residues 530–850, containing two SH2 domains and one SH3 domain) was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. FP Assay Conditions—Each experiment (except the [γ-32P]ATP time courses) was performed using PanVera's tyrosine kinase assay kit, green. All reactions and preincubations were carried out at 30 °C in the following reaction buffer: 20 mm Hepes (pH 7.4), 5 mm MgCl2, 2 mm MnCl2, 0.05 mm Na3VO4, and 1 mm dithiothreitol, unless otherwise noted. EGFR was preincubated for 15 min with the indicated concentration of ATP to autophosphorylate the kinase. The reaction was initiated with the addition of substrate, and the decrease in polarization was measured as described. The 15-min preincubation provided ample time for autophosphorylation (23Bertics P.J. Gill G.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 14642-14647Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, we observed that any decrease in polarization caused by autophosphorylation leveled off within the 15-min preincubation (data not shown), so that any observed change in polarization was because of substrate phosphorylation, not autophosphorylation. All FP assays were conducted in the presence of antibody and tracer at 1× concentrations. Assays performed in end-point mode were quenched by the addition of protein-tyrosine kinase quench buffer (12 mm EDTA, pH 7.5) and antibody and tracer to 1×, for final concentrations of 6 mm EDTA, 1× antibody, and 1× tracer. [γ-32P]ATP Phosphate Incorporation Assay—The amount of phosphate incorporated into the substrate was quantified using radiolabeled ATP (23Bertics P.J. Gill G.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 14642-14647Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24Weber W. Bertics P.J. Gill G.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 14631-14636Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Aliquots of the reaction mixture (60 μl) were removed and quenched with 700 μl of 10% trichloroacetic acid. Three microliters (3 μl) of acetylated bovine serum albumin (10 mg/ml) was added, and the precipitated poly(Glu,Tyr) 4:1 copolymer or the Shc adapter protein was separated from the radiolabeled ATP by filtration. The radioactivity incorporated into the product was quantified by liquid scintillation counting. Data Analysis—All data were fitted with Prism™ software, version 3.0 (GraphPad Software Inc.) using the equations below. One-site competition, where mP = polarization expressed in units of milli-P (1 mP = 0.001 P), mPobserved=mPlowest+mPhighest-mPlowest1+10([pmolphosphate]-logIC50)(Eq. 1) where IC50 refers to the polarization value observed when the amount of phosphate present in the substrate is at the midpoint between its lowest and highest values. One-site competition, solving for log picomole of phosphate incorporated is as follows. log(pmolphosphate)=logmPhighest-mPobservedmPobserved-mPlowest+logIC50(Eq. 2) A single exponential decay, mPobserved=(mPhighest-mPlowest)·e-k·x+mPlowest(Eq. 3) where x = time or picomole of phosphate incorporated and k = the rate constant.

Measuring Steady-state Kinetic Parameters for Wild-type EGFR and the ct1022 Mutant Using Competition Standard Curves—We created competition standard curves relating polarization values to the amounts of phosphorylated product formed using the phosphorylated forms of the substrates (Fig. 3A). We then used equations describing these relationships to calculate the amount of phosphorylated product that caused a given decrease in polarization (see representative data, Fig. 3, B and C). Two-fold serial dilutions of the phosphorylated substrates were prepared, then the antibody and tracer were added under the same conditions (buffer, temperature) used for the assay (see “Experimental Procedures”). Competition standard curves for phosphorylated versions of angiotensin II and the Y1173 peptide were produced in this manner. Because phosphorylated forms of the PLC-γ fragment and poly(Glu,Tyr) 4:1 copolymer were not available, reactions were brought to completion by using a relatively high enzyme concentration. Each phosphorylation reaction contained 2.5 mm ATP and either 2.7 nm (0.3 units/100 μl) EGFR or 1.7 nm (0.6 units/100 μl) ct1022 mutant as well as either 0.12 μm PLC-γ fragment or 10 nm poly(Glu,Tyr) 4:1 copolymer, respectively, and was incubated at 30 °C for 2 h. Two-fold serial dilutions of these phosphorylated substrates were prepared and analyzed as described above for the peptide substrates. For each substrate, we measured and plotted polarization values as a function of the phosphorylated substrate concentration to create the competition standard curve, as shown in Fig. 3A. These data were described by a one-site competition equation (Equation 1), resulting in IC50 values of 0.25 ± 0.06 pmol of phosphate for the poly(Glu,Tyr) 4:1 copolymer, 7.7 ± 0.8 pmol of phosphate for the pY1173 peptide, 9 ± 2 pmol of phosphate for the PLC-γ fragment, and 175 ± 13 pmol of phosphate for angiotensin II. The inset illustrates a direct fit of the same data using the equation for a single exponential decay (Equation 3) with k = 3.5 ± 0.5 pmol of phosphate–1 for the poly(Glu,Tyr) 4:1 copolymer, 0.15 ± 0.02 pmol of phosphate–1 for the pY1173 peptide, 0.098 ± 0.008 pmol of phosphate–1 for the PLC-γ fragment, and 0.0053 ± 0.0006 pmol of phosphate–1 for angiotensin II. The anomalously high IC50 for angiotensin II may be because of its distinct structure (25Carpenter K.A. Wilkes B.C. Schiller P.W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 251: 448-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The results from control experiments involving higher concentrations of enzyme (3.6 and 2.6 nm, respectively, for the 0.12 μm PLC-γ fragment and 10 nm poly(Glu,Tyr) 4:1 copolymer substrates) indicated that our reaction conditions yielded completely phosphorylated substrates (data not shown). After generating the competition standard curves, we performed FP assays and calculated the corresponding amounts of phosphorylated product formed from the transformed one-site competition equation for each substrate (Equation 2). Using FP, we measured substrate phosphorylation directly for each substrate at multiple substrate concentrations. Representative data for both the Y1173 substrate and the PLC-γ fragment are shown in Fig. 3B. In the FP assay, product formation is “coupled” to fluorescent phosphopeptide tracer dissociation from, and the concomitant binding of non-fluorescent phosphorylated substrate (product) to, the antibody, resulting in product detection. Bound product eventually displaces all of the fluorescent phosphopeptide tracer. Therefore, plots of polarization versus time are not linear over long time courses. As the assay progresses to completion, the decrease in polarization gradually plateaus to the polarization value of the free tracer. Although the equation for a straight line could not describe data for the entire time course, the equation for a single exponential decay (Equation 3) described the data very well, with R 2 = 0.98 and 0.99 for the Y1173 peptide and the PLC-γ fragment time courses, respectively. We used Equation 2 (which converts the exponential data to logarithms, thus linearizing them) to calculate the extent of substrate phosphorylation for each individual time point with the competition standard curves, and plotted the results with respect to time. These data were linear, and initial velocities were determined from the slopes of these lines (Equation 5). Similar experiments were performed at multiple substrate concentrations, and Fig. 3C depicts representative data for the Y1173 peptide substrate. Time courses were prepared involving the preincubation of 0.4–1.7 nm (0.1–0.4 units/100 μl) wild-type EGFR or 0.5 nm (0.2 units/100 μl) ct1022 mutant with 2.5 mm ATP, followed by the addition of the Y1173 peptide. Polarization values were transformed into picomole of phosphate transferred/min/pmol of EGFR (Equation 2) as described, and plotted as a function of substrate concentration. Data were fitted to the Michaelis-Menten equation (Equation 6) (26Fersht A. Enzyme Structure and Mechanism. 2nd ed. W. H. Freeman & Co., New York1985: 98-106Google Scholar), and the steady-state kinetic parameters were thus determined. The mutant enzyme yielded a 4-fold higher turnover number for the phosphorylation of the Y1173 peptide substrate than did EGFR. The steady-state kinetic parameters determined in this manner for each substrate are described in Table I.Table ISteady-state kinetic parameters determined by FP for wild-type EGFR and the ct1022 mutantEnzymek cataUnits of k cat are picomole of phosphate transferred per min/pmol of enzyme.KMk cat/KMM-1s-1Y1173 peptideWild-type3.6 ± 0.30.16 ± 0.04 mM(4.0 ± 0.7) × 102ct1022 mutant16 ± 20.23 ± 0.08 mM(1.1 ± 0.2) × 103Ratio4.41.42.8Poly(Glu,Tyr) 4:1 copolymerWild-type0.48 ± 0.0318 ± 4 nM(4.8 ± 0.8) × 105ct1022 mutant1.5 ± 0.129 ± 8 nM(8 ± 2) × 105RatiobRatio is the steady-state kinetic parameter for the reaction catalyzed by the ct1022 mutant divided by the same kinetic parameter for wild-type EGFR.31.61.7PLC-γ fragmentWild-typeck cat has been normalized for variations in wild-type EGFR specific activity.8.0 ± 20.23 ± .09 μM(6 ± 2) × 105ct1022 mutant10 ± 40.3 ± 0.3 μM(5 ± 2) × 105Ratio1.21.30.8Angiotensin IIWild-typeck cat has been normalized for variations in wild-type EGFR specific activity.13 ± 10.24 ± 0.06 mM(9 ± 2) × 102ct1022 mutant5.7 ± 0.40.17 ± 0.05 mM(5.70 ± 0.03) × 102Ratio0.40.70.6Shc adapter proteinWild-typeck cat has been normalized for variations in wild-type EGFR specific activity.0.17 ± 0.052 ± 1 μM(1.4 ± 0.4) × 103ct1022 mutant0.035 ± 0.0020.20 ± 0.05 μM(3.0 ± 0.6) × 103Ratio0.20.12a Units of k cat are picomole of phosphate transferred per min/pmol of enzyme.b Ratio is the steady-state kinetic parameter for the reaction catalyzed by the ct1022 mutant divided by the same kinetic parameter for wild-type EGFR.c k cat has been normalized for variations in wild-type EGFR specific activity. Open table in a new tab Because the poly(Glu,Tyr) 4:1 copolymer and the PLC-γ fragment contain more than one potential phosphorylation site, the kinetic parameters for these substrates are apparent values (27Homann S. Schacher B. Zumstein-Mecker S. Fabbro D. Bold G. Ferrari S. J. Biotechnol. 2001; 86: 51-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). Full-length PLC-γ has four tyrosines that are phosphorylated by EGFR (Tyr-472, Tyr-771, Tyr-783, and Tyr-1254) (28Kim J.W. Sim S.S. Kim U.H. Nishibe S. Wahl M.I. Carpenter G. Rhee S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 3940-3943Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, the fragment of PLC-γ we used as a substrate (residues 538–850) possesses two tyrosines that EGFR can phosphorylate (Tyr-771 and Tyr-783). Steady-state kinetic parameters for angiotensin II and the PLC-γ fragment were within experimental error of those previously measured using the [γ-32P]ATP phosphate incorporation assay (24Weber W. Bertics P.J. Gill G.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 14631-14636Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). 2P. J. Bertics, unpublished data. Verification of Competition Standard Curve Results for the Poly(Glu,Tyr) 4:1 Copolymer Substrate—Although previous control experiments indicated that the poly(Glu,Tyr) 4:1 copolymer and PLC-γ fragment used for generating the competition standard curves had been completely phosphorylated, we further verified these results by employing an additional method for generating a standard curve for the poly(Glu,Tyr) 4:1 copolymer. This second approach calls for performing identical reactions and evaluating them by different methods. We analyzed one reaction with the traditional kinase assay using [γ-32P]ATP, and two other reactions with the FP technique. Given that conditions (enzyme and substrate concentrations, temperature, buffer, etc.) were the same for all reactions, the extent of substrate phosphorylation required to produce a given decrease in polarization could be calculated. We measured the phosphorylation of the poly(Glu,Tyr) 4:1 copolymer (150 nm) by the ct1022 mutant (0.5 nm, 0.13 units/100 μl) in three reactions: the FP assay in both real-time and end-point modes and by the [γ-32P]ATP assay (Fig. 4A) as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Each time course was set up under identical conditions (10 μm ATP and the buffer and temperature described), except that the [γ-32P]ATP assay reaction included 7.5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP/100 μl (inset, le"
https://openalex.org/W2066040992,"Misguided immunoglobulin (Ig) class switch recombination (CSR) has been implicated in the origin of Myc-activating chromosomal translocations, T(12;15), in BALB/c mouse plasmacytomas (PCTs). CSR has also been involved in the progression of T(12;15); for example, the approximation of Myc to the 3'-C alpha enhancer. This study provides evidence for an additional mechanism by which aberrant CSR may facilitate T(12;15): transposition of Ig heavy-chain (IgH) sequences to Myc. Five IgH transposons containing the intronic heavy-chain enhancer, E mu, and a truncated switch mu region, S mu, were found in the first intron of Myc in lymph node cells of IL-6 transgenic BALB/c mice. In two cases E mu/S mu transposition primed Myc to get involved in apparent trans-chromosomal CSR to C gamma 1, presumably leading to T(12;15). Translocations preceded by E mu/S mu transposition can sometimes be distinguished from de novo translocations by molecular fingerprints in translocation breakpoint regions (Ig switch region [S] inversions and unusual gene orders in composite S regions). The presence of such fingerprints in some PCTs suggests that the tumors sometimes evolve from transposition-bearing precursors. We propose that E mu/S mu transposition to Myc may facilitate plasmacytomagenesis by sensitizing Myc to undergo T(12;15) translocation. T(12;15), in turn, juxtaposes Myc to the 3'-C alpha enhancer, which appears to be required for deregulating Myc in a manner that is conducive to PCT development."
https://openalex.org/W2078045774,"Several years ago, we demonstrated that glucose induced tyrosine phosphorylation of a 125-kDa protein (p125) in pancreatic β-cells (Konrad, R. J., Dean, R. M., Young, R. A., Bilings, P. C., and Wolf, B. A. (1996) <i>J. Biol. Chem.</i> 271, 24179–24186). Glucose induced p125 tyrosine phosphorylation in β-TC3 insulinoma cells, β-HC9 cells, and in freshly isolated rat islets, whereas increased tyrosine phosphorylation was not observed with other fuel secretagogues. Initial efforts to identify p125 were unsuccessful, so a new approach was taken. The protein was purified from βTC6,F7 cells via an immunodepletion method. After electrophoresis and colloidal Coomassie Blue staining, the area of the gel corresponding to p125 was excised and subjected to tryptic digestion. Afterward, mass spectrometry was performed and the presence of Crk-associated substrate (Cas) was detected. Commercially available antibodies against Cas were obtained and tested directly in β-cells, confirming glucose-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of Cas. Further experiments demonstrated that in β-cells the glucose-induced increase in Cas tyrosine phosphorylation occurs immediately and is not accompanied by increased focal adhesion kinase tyrosine phosphorylation. Finally, it is also demonstrated via Western blotting that Cas is present in normal isolated rat islets. Together, these results show that the identity of the previously described p125 β-cell protein is Cas and that Cas undergoes rapid glucose-induced tyrosine phosphorylation in β-cells."
