https://openalex.org/W123361586,"The identity of the major cobamide in liver has not been satisfactorily established. Cyanocobalamin (vitamin B12, 5,6dimethylbenzimidazolylcobamide cyanide), which has been obtained in crystalline form with liver as a source material (1, 2), is certainly a very minor component of the cobalamins in liver. Analyses of liver concentrates, both by a paper chromatographicbioautographic method (3) and by a chemical method (4), have shown that cyanocobalamin is usually not present in detectable amounts and seldom constitutes as much as 10% of the total cobalamin. The preparation of cyanocobalamin from liver probably was made possible by the presence of cyanide in the charcoal used in the isolation process. Examination of a liver extract by the chromatographic-bioautographic method (3) indicated that hydroxocobalamin (vitamin B12b, 5,6-dimethylbenzimidazolylcobamide hydroxide) was the most abundant cobalamin. This compound was also obtained in pure form from liver (1, 5). However, the recent discovery of the cobamide coenzymes in bacteria (6,7) and the demonstration that they constitute a large part of the total cobamides in these organisms (8,9) raised the possibility that coenzyme Bit (5,6-dimethylbenzimidazolylcobamide coenzyme, DMBC coenzyme, DBC coenzyme) may be a constituent of liver. Since coenzyme B12, like the adenylcobamide coenzyme (lo), is relatively unstable and is readily converted to hydroxocobalamin or cyanocobalamin by treatment with light or cyanide,’ respectively, the inadvertent decomposition of the coenzyme, if present in liver extracts, could account for previous observations on the occurrence of the two cobalamin vitamins. The present paper reports some observations on the occurrence and abundance of a cobamide coenzyme, which has been identified as coenzyme Blz, in livers of rabbit, chicken, sheep, and man. A brief report of the occurrence of coenzyme Blz in rabbit liver has already appeared (7)."

https://openalex.org/W2031520170,"A syndrome in male cats analogous to chromatin-positive Klinefelter's syndrome in human males has been demonstrated. The physical characteristics which suggested an abnormality of chromosome number in cats were ""calico"" or ""tortoise-shell"" coat colors in a male. Buccal mucosal smears were found to have ""female-type"" patterns in two out of 12 such male cats screened, and these two were found to have a diploid chromosome number of 39 rather than the normal 38. Testicular biopsy performed on one revealed an abnormal pattern; no gonadal tissue was found in the other cat with an abnormal chromosome number. These findings indicate that the cat, in addition to the mouse, is available for experimental study of chromosome number abnormalities."

It was noted, however, that the majority of the operated animals showed perfect retention of the ""fear"" response to the conditioned stimulus."

https://openalex.org/W2004372150,"d-Tubocurarine chloride, when added to the solution bathing the outside of the isolated frog skin, enhances the net flux of water which arises from the influence of an osmotic gradient. Although this effect appears to result from alteration in the pore size of the membrane, it is not accompanied by any consistent change in the resting potential."

The time of death was lengthened in those rats suffering lethal shock. Controls consistently showed 0–10 per cent survivors."

https://openalex.org/W1982852868,"When the duration or repetition rate of pulses in the left ear is increased, while steady, in-phase, thermal noise sounds in the right ear, the pulses are heard to move toward the median plane. At still longer durations (for a given repetition rate) the loudness of noise on the right diminishes, until finally all sound is localized at the median plane."
https://openalex.org/W2033539153,"THE facts adduced by B. Babington Smith1 appear to be new. At first it seemed that they might be explained in terms of what Stout calls “the conditions of attention”2—conditions that include change as well as extensity, intensity, duration, contrast and interest. If Stout is right, the factor missing in the object was change. I therefore repeated the experiment with objects containing moving parts, like the second-hand of a watch and an oscillating compass needle, and was amazed to find that the peripheral fade-out was, if anything, more marked."
