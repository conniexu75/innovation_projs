https://openalex.org/W2013943493,"Hydrothermal vents jetting out water at 380 degrees +/- 30 degrees C have been discovered on the axis of the East Pacific Rise. The hottest waters issue from mineralized chimneys and are blackened by sulfide precipitates. These hydrothermal springs are the sites of actively forming massive sulfide mineral deposits. Cooler springs are clear to milky and support exotic benthic communities of giant tube worms, clams, and crabs similar to those found at the Gal√°pagos spreading center. Four prototype geophysical experiments were successfully conducted in and near the vent area: seismic refraction measurements with both source (thumper) and receivers on the sea floor, on-bottom gravity measurements, in situ magnetic gradiometer measurements from the submersible Alvin over a sea-floor magnetic reversal boundary, and an active electrical sounding experiment. These high-resolution determinations of crustal properties along the spreading center were made to gain knowledge of the source of new oceanic crust and marine magnetic anomalies, the nature of the axial magma chamber, and the depth of hydrothermal circulation."

The film was put into contact with a thin, aqueous electrolyte gel to construct an electrochemical sandwich-type photocell with a junction structure SnO(2)/bR/electrolyte/Au electrode. Under visible light irradiation, the bR-based photocell produced an efficient rectified photocurrent that proved to have unique differential responsivity to light intensity, which is characteristic of in vivo biological photoreceptors. An artificial photoreceptor comprising a pixel network of the bR photocell was fabricated in an attempt to study image-detecting and processing abilities of bR."

This taxon is shown to consist of at least three sibling species in shallow waters. The two most commonly studied of these show highly significant differences in growth rate and oxygen isotopic ratios, parameters routinely used to estimate past climatic conditions; unusual coloration in the third may have confused research on coral bleaching. Interpretation or comparison of past and current studies can be jeopardized by ignoring these species boundaries."
https://openalex.org/W2021904361,"Massive sulfide deposits were discovered from the diving saucer Cyana on the accreting plate boundary region of the East Pacific Rise near 21 degrees N. The deposits form conical and tubular structures lying on a basaltic basement. Mineralogical and geochemical analyses showed two main types of intimately associated products: a polymetallic sulfide-rich material composed of pyrite and marcasite in association, zinc-rich phases, and copper-rich compounds, and an iron-rich oxide and hydroxide material (also called gossan) composed largely of goethite and limonite. Silicate phases such as opaline, silica, iron-silicon clay, and trace amounts of mica and zeolite are encountered in both types of material. Possible mechanisms for the formation of the sulfide deposits on the East Pacific Rise are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W2076236220,"Incremental single-electron charging of size-quantized states has been observed in the well in submicrometer double-barrier resonant tunneling devices. In order to distinguish between the effects of size quantization and the single-electron charging, the heterostructure material was grown asymmetrical so that one barrier is substantially less transparent than the other. In the voltage polarity such that the emitter barrier is more transparent than the collector barrier, electrons accumulate in the well; incremental electron occupation of the well is accompanied by Coulomb blockade, which leads to sharp steps of the tunneling current. In the opposite voltage polarity the emitter barrier is less transparent than the collector barrier and the tunneling current reflects resonant tunneling through size-quantized well states."

""Naked"" (unsolvated) CpRh(CO) was detected, and direct measurements of the rates of reaction of this very short-lived complex with alkane C-H bonds were made. Activation of C-H bonds occurs on almost every collision for alkanes of moderate size, and intermediates in which the alkanes are bound to the metal centers, without their C-H bonds being fully broken, are implicated as intermediates in the overall reaction."
https://openalex.org/W2053341379,"The formation of a polyploid endosperm tissue has long been considered a unique and defining feature (autapomorphy) of angiosperms. Contemporaneous with the fertilization of an egg nucleus by a sperm nucleus in Ephedra trifurca (a nonflowering seed plant closely related to angiosperms), a second fertilization event has previously been shown to occur between a second sperm nucleus and the sister nucleus of the egg nucleus. Development of the second fertilization product is now shown to be fundamentally similar to that of endosperm in primitive flowering plants: both are characterized by an initial period of free nuclear proliferation followed by a process of cellularization. In Ephedra, however, the second fertilization product ultimately yields additional embryos. If double fertilization in Ephedra and angiosperms is evolutionarily homologous, it is likely that endosperm evolved from a supernumerary fertilization event that originally produced embryos into one that produced a specialized nonembryo tissue dedicated to the nourishment of the zygotic embryo."
https://openalex.org/W1965027198,"Irregular length of day (LOD) fluctuations on time scales of less than a few years are largely produced by atmospheric torques on the underlying planet. Significant coherence is found between the respective time series of LOD and atmospheric angular momentum (AAM) determinations at periods down to 8 days, with lack of coherence at shorter periods caused by the declining signal-to-measurement noise ratios of both data types. Refinements to the currently accepted model of tidal Earth rotation variations are required, incorporating in particular the nonequilibrium effect of the oceans. The remaining discrepancies between LOD and AAM in the 100- to 10-day period range may be due to either a common error in the AAM data sets from different meteorological centers, or another component of the angular momentum budget."

https://openalex.org/W2028872817,"High-quality Josephson junctions, with both electrodes made from niobium and with an aluminum-oxide insulating barrier, were introduced in 1983. This niobium junction is very stable, reliable, controllable, and reproducible. Because of these excellent characteristics, these junctions can be applied to large-scale integrated (LSI) circuits, such as microprocessors having a few thousand gates and a few kilobits of memory. These circuits operate much faster and consume less power than any semiconductor circuit now available. Integrated Josephson circuits are now being tested in a closed-cycle refrigerator. The next step is to design a special-purpose, small-scale Josephson computer and to demonstrate its high performance."
https://openalex.org/W2001525457,"Following 1990's record temperatures, last year ended as the second warmest ever recorded. But it might have set yet another record had it not been for the eruption of Mount Pinatubo. The layer of sun-blocking haze spewed by the Philippine volcano is sending a chill through the climate system that may already have shown up in the temperature record. This volcanic cooling, which could last a couple of years, should also temporarily chill the debate about whether the green house effect is behind the warming of recent years. It's been hard enough to draw firm conclusions about any greenhouse warming from world temperature data, and Pinatubo's masking effect should make it harder still during the next few years. But the cooling episode may advance the science of climate prediction indirectly. It will give scientists an opportunity to check out their computer greenhouse models by seeing how well they do at predicting the volcano-induced climate change."

https://openalex.org/W1998039787,"The relations between Japan and the United States in space form a microcosm of the complex, multidimensional interactions between these two powerful societies. Cooperation and competition exist side by side, and the future balance between them is uncertain. The United States needs to develop a strategy with respect to future U.S.-Japanese space relations that balances national security, political, scientific, and economic interests. Crafting such a strategy is particularly difficult while both the United States and Japan debate the goals and content of their future space programs and while the two nations try to assess their broader interests and roles in the rapidly changing geopolitical environment. Essential to a productive approach to U.S.-Japanese space relations is an accurate understanding of the character and content of the Japanese space effort."

https://openalex.org/W2110073594,"Plant virologists have studied movement proteins for about 10 years, but recent work in several labs has suggested that the proteins may be just as valuable to the biotech industry as they are to plant viruses. Researchers are using them to design novel viral vectors that can easily put new genes into plants, where they will be expressed at high levels, thereby turning the plants into factories for making pharmaceutical proteins and industrial enzymes. A demonstration project completed last summer in which scientists at Biosource Genetics Corporation of Vacaville, California, and the University of California, Riverside, produced the protein tricosanthin, an experimental AIDS drug, in field tobacco, has already shown that the approach works. The plant virus vectors might also be useful in agriculture for genetically engineering new strains of crop plants. In particular, they might be valuable for the cereals, which are hard to genetically engineer by current methods. And the work might even allow the viral proteins to be turned against the viruses, by aiding in the development of virus-resistant plants."
