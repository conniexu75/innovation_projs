https://openalex.org/W2074918990,"Major depression, because of its recurring and life-threatening nature, is one of the top 10 diseases for global disease burden. Major depression is still diagnosed on the basis of clinical symptoms in patients. The search for specific biological markers is of great importance to advance the method of diagnosis for depression. We examined the methylation profile of 2 CpG islands (I and IV) at the promoters of the brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) gene, which is well known to be involved in the pathophysiology of depression. We analyzed genomic DNA from peripheral blood of 20 Japanese patients with major depression and 18 healthy controls to identify an appropriate epigenetic biomarker to aid in the establishment of an objective system for the diagnosis of depression. Methylation rates at each CpG unit was measured using a MassArray® system (SEQUENOM), and 2-dimensional hierarchical clustering analyses were undertaken to determine the validity of these methylation profiles as a diagnostic biomarker. Analyses of the dendrogram from methylation profiles of CpG I, but not IV, demonstrated that classification of healthy controls and patients at the first branch completely matched the clinical diagnosis. Despite the small number of subjects, our results indicate that classification based on the DNA methylation profiles of CpG I of the BDNF gene may be a valuable diagnostic biomarker for major depression."
https://openalex.org/W2083073082,"Insect gustatory receptors are predicted to have a seven-transmembrane structure and are distantly related to insect olfactory receptors, which have an inverted topology compared with G-protein coupled receptors, including mammalian olfactory receptors. In contrast, the topology of insect gustatory receptors remains unknown. Except for a few examples from Drosophila, the specificity of individual insect gustatory receptors is also unknown. In this study, the total number of identified gustatory receptors in Bombyx mori was expanded from 65 to 69. BmGr8, a silkmoth gustatory receptor from the sugar receptor subfamily, was expressed in insect cells. Membrane topology studies on BmGr8 indicate that, like insect olfactory receptors, it has an inverted topology relative to G protein-coupled receptors. An orphan GR from the bitter receptor family, BmGr53, yielded similar results. We infer, from the finding that two distantly related BmGrs have an intracellular N-terminus and an odd number of transmembrane spans, that this is likely to be a general topology for all insect gustatory receptors. We also show that BmGr8 functions independently in Sf9 cells and responds in a concentration-dependent manner to the polyalcohols myo-inositol and epi-inositol but not to a range of mono- and di-saccharides. BmGr8 is the first chemoreceptor shown to respond specifically to inositol, an important or essential nutrient for some Lepidoptera. The selectivity of BmGr8 responses is consistent with the known responses of one of the gustatory receptor neurons in the lateral styloconic sensilla of B. mori, which responds to myo-inositol and epi-inositol but not to allo-inositol."
https://openalex.org/W1988099254,"Diabetes and TB are associated, and diabetes is increasingly common in low-income countries where tuberculosis (TB) is highly endemic. However, the role of diabetes for TB has not been assessed in populations where HIV is prevalent.A case-control study was conducted in an urban population in Tanzania among culture-confirmed pulmonary TB patients and non-TB neighbourhood controls. Participants were tested for diabetes according to WHO guidelines and serum concentrations of acute phase reactants were measured. The association between diabetes and TB, and the role of HIV as an effect modifier, were examined using logistic regression. Since blood glucose levels increase during the acute phase response, we adjusted for elevated serum acute phase reactants.Among 803 cases and 350 controls the mean (SD) age was 34.8 (11.9) and 33.8 (12.0) years, and the prevalence of diabetes was 16.7% (95% CI: 14.2; 19.4) and 9.4% (6.6; 13.0), respectively. Diabetes was associated with TB (OR 2.2, 95% CI: 1.5; 3.4, p<0.001). However, the association depended on HIV status (interaction, p = 0.01) due to a stronger association among HIV uninfected (OR 4.2, 95% CI: 1.5; 11.6, p = 0.01) compared to HIV infected (OR 0.1, 95% CI: 0.01; 1.8, p = 0.13) after adjusting for age, sex, demographic factors and elevated serum acute phase reactants.Diabetes is a risk factor for TB in HIV uninfected, whereas the association in HIV infected patients needs further study. The increasing diabetes prevalence may be a threat to TB control."
https://openalex.org/W2150072764,"Mechanical force significantly modulates both inflammation and fibrosis, yet the fundamental mechanisms that regulate these interactions remain poorly understood. Here we performed microarray analysis to compare gene expression in mechanically loaded wounds vs. unloaded control wounds in an established murine hypertrophic scar (HTS) model. We identified 853 mechanically regulated genes (false discovery rate <2) at d 14 postinjury, a subset of which were enriched for T-cell-regulated pathways. To substantiate the role of T cells in scar mechanotransduction, we applied the HTS model to T-cell-deficient mice and wild-type mice. We found that scar formation in T-cell-deficient mice was reduced by almost 9-fold (P < 0.001) with attenuated epidermal (by 2.6-fold, P < 0.01) and dermal (3.9-fold, P < 0.05) proliferation. Mechanical stimulation was highly associated with sustained T-cell-dependent Th2 cytokine (IL-4 and IL-13) and chemokine (MCP-1) signaling. Further, T-cell-deficient mice failed to recruit systemic inflammatory cells such as macrophages or monocytic fibroblast precursors in response to mechanical loading. These findings indicate that T-cell-regulated fibrogenic pathways are highly mechanoresponsive and suggest that mechanical forces induce a chronic-like inflammatory state through immune-dependent activation of both local and systemic cell populations.—Wong, V.

https://openalex.org/W2053795364,"Predation risk is often associated with group formation in prey, but recent advances in methods for analysing the social structure of animal societies make it possible to quantify the effects of risk on the complex dynamics of spatial and temporal organisation. In this paper we use social network analysis to investigate the impact of variation in predation risk on the social structure of guppy shoals and the frequency and duration of shoal splitting (fission) and merging (fusion) events. Our analyses revealed that variation in the level of predation risk was associated with divergent social dynamics, with fish in high-risk populations displaying a greater number of associations with overall greater strength and connectedness than those from low-risk sites. Temporal patterns of organisation also differed according to predation risk, with fission events more likely to occur over two short time periods (5 minutes and 20 minutes) in low-predation fish and over longer time scales (>1.5 hours) in high-predation fish. Our findings suggest that predation risk influences the fine-scale social structure of prey populations and that the temporal aspects of organisation play a key role in defining social systems."
https://openalex.org/W2104149855,"Phylogenetic diversity—patterns of phylogenetic relatedness among organisms in ecological communities—provides important insights into the mechanisms underlying community assembly. Studies that measure phylogenetic diversity in microbial communities have primarily been limited to a single marker gene approach, using the small subunit of the rRNA gene (SSU-rRNA) to quantify phylogenetic relationships among microbial taxa. In this study, we present an approach for inferring phylogenetic relationships among microorganisms based on the random metagenomic sequencing of DNA fragments. To overcome challenges caused by the fragmentary nature of metagenomic data, we leveraged fully sequenced bacterial genomes as a scaffold to enable inference of phylogenetic relationships among metagenomic sequences from multiple phylogenetic marker gene families. The resulting metagenomic phylogeny can be used to quantify the phylogenetic diversity of microbial communities based on metagenomic data sets. We applied this method to understand patterns of microbial phylogenetic diversity and community assembly along an oceanic depth gradient, and compared our findings to previous studies of this gradient using SSU-rRNA gene and metagenomic analyses. Bacterial phylogenetic diversity was highest at intermediate depths beneath the ocean surface, whereas taxonomic diversity (diversity measured by binning sequences into taxonomically similar groups) showed no relationship with depth. Phylogenetic diversity estimates based on the SSU-rRNA gene and the multi-gene metagenomic phylogeny were broadly concordant, suggesting that our approach will be applicable to other metagenomic data sets for which corresponding SSU-rRNA gene sequences are unavailable. Our approach opens up the possibility of using metagenomic data to study microbial diversity in a phylogenetic context."
https://openalex.org/W2130706765,"Background Accurate mechanical characterization by the atomic force microscope at the highest spatial resolution requires that topography is deconvoluted from indentation. The measured height of nanoscale features in the atomic force microscope (AFM) is almost always smaller than the true value, which is often explained away as sample deformation, the formation of salt deposits and/or dehydration. We show that the real height of nano-objects cannot be obtained directly: a result arising as a consequence of the local probe-sample geometry. Methods and Findings We have modeled the tip-surface-sample interaction as the sum of the interaction between the tip and the surface and the tip and the sample. We find that the dynamics of the AFM cannot differentiate between differences in force resulting from 1) the chemical and/or mechanical characteristics of the surface or 2) a step in topography due to the size of the sample; once the size of a feature becomes smaller than the effective area of interaction between the AFM tip and sample, the measured height is compromised. This general result is a major contributor to loss of height and can amount to up to ∼90% for nanoscale features. In particular, these very large values in height loss may occur even when there is no sample deformation, and, more generally, height loss does not correlate with sample deformation. DNA and IgG antibodies have been used as model samples where experimental height measurements are shown to closely match the predicted phenomena. Conclusions Being able to measure the true height of single nanoscale features is paramount in many nanotechnology applications since phenomena and properties in the nanoscale critically depend on dimensions. Our approach allows accurate predictions for the true height of nanoscale objects and will lead to reliable mechanical characterization at the highest spatial resolution."
https://openalex.org/W2047286867,"Background Plants are challenged by a large number of environmental stresses that reduce productivity and even cause death. Both chloroplasts and mitochondria produce reactive oxygen species under normal conditions; however, stress causes an imbalance in these species that leads to deviations from normal cellular conditions and a variety of toxic effects. Mitochondria have uncoupling proteins (UCPs) that uncouple electron transport from ATP synthesis. There is evidence that UCPs play a role in alleviating stress caused by reactive oxygen species overproduction. However, direct evidence that UCPs protect plants from abiotic stress is lacking. Methodology/Principal Findings Tolerances to salt and water deficit were analyzed in transgenic tobacco plants that overexpress a UCP (AtUCP1) from Arabidopsis thaliana. Seeds of AtUCP1 transgenic lines germinated faster, and adult plants showed better responses to drought and salt stress than wild-type (WT) plants. These phenotypes correlated with increased water retention and higher gas exchange parameters in transgenic plants that overexpress AtUCP1. WT plants exhibited increased respiration under stress, while transgenic plants were only slightly affected. Furthermore, the transgenic plants showed reduced accumulation of hydrogen peroxide in stressed leaves compared with WT plants. Conclusions/Significance Higher levels of AtUCP1 improved tolerance to multiple abiotic stresses, and this protection was correlated with lower oxidative stress. Our data support previous assumptions that UCPs reduce the imbalance of reactive oxygen species. Our data also suggest that UCPs may play a role in stomatal closure, which agrees with other evidence of a direct relationship between these proteins and photosynthesis. Manipulation of the UCP protein expression in mitochondria is a new avenue for crop improvement and may lead to crops with greater tolerance for challenging environmental conditions."
https://openalex.org/W2066254817,"Aberrant epigenetic nuclear reprogramming results in low somatic cloning efficiency. Altering epigenetic status by applying histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACi) enhances developmental potential of somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT) embryos. The present study was carried out to examine the effects of Oxamflatin, a novel HDACi, on the nuclear reprogramming and development of bovine SCNT embryos in vitro. We found that Oxamflatin modified the acetylation status on H3K9 and H3K18, increased total and inner cell mass (ICM) cell numbers and the ratio of ICM∶trophectoderm (TE) cells, reduced the rate of apoptosis in SCNT blastocysts, and significantly enhanced the development of bovine SCNT embryos in vitro. Furthermore, Oxamflatin treatment suppressed expression of the pro-apoptotic gene Bax and stimulated expression of the anti-apoptotic gene Bcl-XL and the pluripotency-related genes OCT4 and SOX2 in SCNT blastocysts. Additionally, the treatment also reduced the DNA methylation level of satellite I in SCNT blastocysts. In conclusion, Oxamflatin modifies epigenetic status and gene expression, increases blastocyst quality, and subsequently enhances the nuclear reprogramming and developmental potential of SCNT embryos."
https://openalex.org/W2080296308,"Background To overcome the increasing resistance of pathogens to existing antibiotics the 10×'20 Initiative declared the urgent need for a global commitment to develop 10 new antimicrobial drugs by the year 2020. Naturally occurring animal antibiotics are an obvious place to start. The recently sequenced genomes of mammals that are divergent from human and mouse, including the tammar wallaby and the platypus, provide an opportunity to discover novel antimicrobials. Marsupials and monotremes are ideal potential sources of new antimicrobials because they give birth to underdeveloped immunologically naïve young that develop outside the sterile confines of a uterus in harsh pathogen-laden environments. While their adaptive immune system develops innate immune factors produced either by the mother or by the young must play a key role in protecting the immune-compromised young. In this study we focus on the cathelicidins, a key family of antimicrobial peptide genes. Principal Finding We identified 14 cathelicidin genes in the tammar wallaby genome and 8 in the platypus genome. The tammar genes were expressed in the mammary gland during early lactation before the adaptive immune system of the young develops, as well as in the skin of the pouch young. Both platypus and tammar peptides were effective in killing a broad range of bacterial pathogens. One potent peptide, expressed in the early stages of tammar lactation, effectively killed multidrug-resistant clinical isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Acinetobacter baumannii. Conclusions and Significance Marsupial and monotreme young are protected by antimicrobial peptides that are potent, broad spectrum and salt resistant. The genomes of our distant relatives may hold the key for the development of novel drugs to combat multidrug-resistant pathogens."
https://openalex.org/W2124522940,"Diabetes is a frequent underlying medical condition among individuals with Staphylococcus aureus infections, and diabetic patients often suffer from chronic inflammation and prolonged infections. Neutrophils are the most abundant inflammatory cells during the early stages of bacterial diseases, and previous studies have reported deficiencies in neutrophil function in diabetic hosts. We challenged age-matched hyperglycemic and normoglycemic NOD mice intraperitoneally with S. aureus and evaluated the fate of neutrophils recruited to the peritoneal cavity. Neutrophils were more abundant in the peritoneal fluids of infected diabetic mice by 48 h after bacterial inoculation, and they showed prolonged viability ex vivo compared to neutrophils from infected nondiabetic mice. These differences correlated with reduced apoptosis of neutrophils from diabetic mice and were dependent upon the presence of S. aureus and a functional neutrophil respiratory burst. Decreased apoptosis correlated with impaired clearance of neutrophils by macrophages both in vitro and in vivo and prolonged production of proinflammatory tumor necrosis factor alpha by neutrophils from diabetic mice. Our results suggest that defects in neutrophil apoptosis may contribute to the chronic inflammation and the inability to clear staphylococcal infections observed in diabetic patients."
https://openalex.org/W2139674628,"Overexpression of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is a hallmark of head and neck cancers and confers increased resistance and inferior survival rates. Despite targeted agents against EGFR, such as cetuximab (C225), almost half of treated patients fail this therapy, necessitating novel therapeutic strategies. Poly (ADP-Ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors (PARPi) have gained recent attention due to their unique selectivity in killing tumors with defective DNA repair. In this study, we demonstrate that C225 enhances cytotoxicity with the PARPi ABT-888 in UM-SCC1, UM-SCC6, and FaDu head and neck cancer cells. The mechanism of increased susceptibility to C225 and PARPi involves C225-mediated reduction of non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ)- and homologous recombination (HR)-mediated DNA double strand break (DSB) repair, the subsequent persistence of DNA damage, and activation of the intrinsic apoptotic pathway. By generating a DSB repair deficiency, C225 can render head and neck tumor cells susceptible to PARP inhibition. The combination of C225 and the PARPi ABT-888 can thus be an innovative treatment strategy to potentially improve outcomes in head and neck cancer patients. Furthermore, this strategy may also be feasible for other EGFR overexpressing tumors, including lung and brain cancers."
https://openalex.org/W2172024195,"While aging leads to a reduction in the capacity for regeneration after pneumonectomy (PNX) in most mammals, this biological phenomenon has not been characterized over the lifetime of mice. We measured the age-specific (3, 9, 24 month) effects of PNX on physiology, morphometry, cell proliferation and apoptosis, global gene expression, and lung fibroblast phenotype and clonogenicity in female C57BL6 mice. The data show that only 3 month old mice were fully capable of restoring lung volumes by day 7 and total alveolar surface area by 21 days. By 9 months, the rate of regeneration was slower (with incomplete regeneration by 21 days), and by 24 months there was no regrowth 21 days post-PNX. The early decline in regeneration rate was not associated with changes in alveolar epithelial cell type II (AECII) proliferation or apoptosis rate. However, significant apoptosis and lack of cell proliferation was evident after PNX in both total cells and AECII cells in 24 mo mice. Analysis of gene expression at several time points (1, 3 and 7 days) post-PNX in 9 versus 3 month mice was consistent with a myofibroblast signature (increased Tnc, Lox1, Col3A1, Eln and Tnfrsf12a) and more alpha smooth muscle actin (αSMA) positive myofibroblasts were present after PNX in 9 month than 3 month mice. Isolated lung fibroblasts showed a significant age-dependent loss of clonogenicity. Moreover, lung fibroblasts isolated from 9 and 17 month mice exhibited higher αSMA, Col3A1, Fn1 and S100A expression, and lower expression of the survival gene Mdk consistent with terminal differentiation. These data show that concomitant loss of clonogenicity and progressive myofibroblastic differentiation contributes to the age-dependent decline in the rate of lung regeneration."
https://openalex.org/W1987202109,"Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and placental growth factor (PLGF) are increased in the maternal circulation during pregnancy. These factors may increase blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability, yet brain edema does not normally occur during pregnancy. We therefore hypothesized that in pregnancy, the BBB adapts to high levels of these permeability factors. We investigated the influence of pregnancy-related circulating factors on VEGF-induced BBB permeability by perfusing cerebral veins with plasma from nonpregnant (NP) or late-pregnant (LP) rats (n=6/group) and measuring permeability in response to VEGF. The effect of VEGF, PLGF, and VEGF-receptor (VEGFR) activation on BBB permeability was also determined. Results showed that VEGF significantly increased permeability (×107μm3/min) from 9.7 ± 3.5 to 21.0 ± 1.5 (P<0.05) in NP veins exposed to NP plasma, that was prevented when LP veins were exposed to LP plasma; (9.7±3.8; P>0.05). Both LP plasma and soluble FMS-like tyrosine-kinase 1 (sFlt1) in NP plasma abolished VEGF-induced BBB permeability in NP veins (9.5±2.9 and 12±2.6; P>0.05). PLGF significantly increased BBB permeability in NP plasma (18±1.4; P<0.05), and required only VEGFR1 activation, whereas VEGF-induced BBB permeability required both VEGFR1 and VEGFR2. Our findings suggest that VEGF and PLGF enhance BBB permeability through different VEGFR pathways and that circulating sFlt1 prevents VEGF- and PLGF-induced BBB permeability during pregnancy.—Schreurs, M.

https://openalex.org/W2054516746,"The Na(+)/K(+) ATPase is an almost ubiquitous integral membrane protein within the animal kingdom. It is also the selective target for cardiotonic derivatives, widely prescribed inhibitors for patients with heart failure. Functional studies revealed that ouabain-sensitive residues distributed widely throughout the primary sequence of the protein. Recently, structural work has brought some consensus to the functional observations. Here, we use a spectroscopic approach to estimate distances between a fluorescent ouabain and a lanthanide binding tag (LBT), which was introduced at five different positions in the Na(+)/K(+) ATPase sequence. These five normally functional LBT-Na(+)/K(+) ATPase constructs were expressed in the cell membrane of Xenopus laevis oocytes, operating under physiological internal and external ion conditions. The spectroscopic data suggest two mutually exclusive distances between the LBT and the fluorescent ouabain. From the estimated distances and using homology models of the LBT-Na(+)/K(+) ATPase constructs, approximate ouabain positions could be determined. Our results suggest that ouabain binds at two sites along the ion permeation pathway of the Na(+)/K(+) ATPase. The external site (low apparent affinity) occupies the same region as previous structural findings. The high apparent affinity site is, however, slightly deeper toward the intracellular end of the protein. Interestingly, in both cases the lactone ring faces outward. We propose a sequential ouabain binding mechanism that is consistent with all functional and structural studies."
https://openalex.org/W2157182219,"Background Hyperglycemia-induced oxidative stress plays a central role in the development of diabetic myocardial complications. Adiponectin (APN), an adipokine with anti-diabetic and anti-ischemic effects, is decreased in diabetes. It is unknown whether or not antioxidant treatment with N-acetylcysteine (NAC) and/or allopurinol (ALP) can attenuate APN deficiency and myocardial ischemia reperfusion (MI/R) injury in the early stage of diabetes. Methodology/Principal Findings Control or streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic rats were either untreated (C, D) or treated with NAC (1.5 g/kg/day) or ALP (100 mg/kg/day) or their combination for four weeks starting one week after STZ injection. Plasma and cardiac biochemical parameters were measured after the completion of treatment, and the rats were subjected to MI/R by occluding the left anterior descending artery for 30 min followed by 2 h reperfusion. Plasma and cardiac APN levels were decreased in diabetic rats accompanied by decreased cardiac APN receptor 2 (AdipoR2), reduced phosphorylation of Akt, signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) and endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) but increased IL-6 and TNF-α (all P<0.05 vs. C). NAC but not ALP increased cardiac APN concentrations and AdipoR2 expression in diabetic rats. ALP enhanced the effects of NAC in restoring cardiac AdipoR2 and phosphorylation of Akt, STAT3 and eNOS in diabetic rats. Further, NAC and ALP, respectively, decreased postischemic myocardial infarct size and creatinine kinase-MB (CK-MB) release in diabetic rats, while their combination conferred synergistic protective effects. In addition, exposure of cultured rat cardiomyocytes to high glucose resulted in significant reduction of cardiomyocyte APN concentration and AdipoR2 protein expression. APN supplementation restored high glucose induced AdipoR2 reduction in cardiomyocytes. Conclusions/Significance NAC and ALP synergistically restore myocardial APN and AdipoR2 mediated eNOS activation. This may represent the mechanism through which NAC and ALP combination greatly reduces MI/R injury in early diabetic rats."
https://openalex.org/W2025517641,"Benzene is a ubiquitous environmental contaminant and is widely used in industry. Exposure to benzene causes a number of serious health problems, including blood disorders and leukemia. Benzene undergoes complex metabolism in humans, making mechanistic determination of benzene toxicity difficult. We used a functional genomics approach to identify the genes that modulate the cellular toxicity of three of the phenolic metabolites of benzene, hydroquinone (HQ), catechol (CAT) and 1,2,4-benzenetriol (BT), in the model eukaryote Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Benzene metabolites generate oxidative and cytoskeletal stress, and tolerance requires correct regulation of iron homeostasis and the vacuolar ATPase. We have identified a conserved bZIP transcription factor, Yap3p, as important for a HQ-specific response pathway, as well as two genes that encode putative NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductases, PST2 and YCP4. Many of the yeast genes identified have human orthologs that may modulate human benzene toxicity in a similar manner and could play a role in benzene exposure-related disease."
https://openalex.org/W2095417811,"Background Asthma is a chronic inflammatory disease with a strong genetic predisposition. A major challenge for candidate gene association studies in asthma is the selection of biologically relevant genes. Methodology/Principal Findings Using epithelial RNA expression arrays, HapMap allele frequency variation, and the literature, we identified six possible candidate susceptibility genes for childhood asthma including ADCY2, DNAH5, KIF3A, PDE4B, PLAU, SPRR2B. To evaluate these genes, we compared the genotypes of 194 predominantly tagging SNPs in 790 asthmatic, allergic and non-allergic children. We found that SNPs in all six genes were nominally associated with asthma (p<0.05) in our discovery cohort and in three independent cohorts at either the SNP or gene level (p<0.05). Further, we determined that our selection approach was superior to random selection of genes either differentially expressed in asthmatics compared to controls (p = 0.0049) or selected based on the literature alone (p = 0.0049), substantiating the validity of our gene selection approach. Importantly, we observed that 7 of 9 SNPs in the KIF3A gene more than doubled the odds of asthma (OR = 2.3, p<0.0001) and increased the odds of allergic disease (OR = 1.8, p<0.008). Our data indicate that KIF3A rs7737031 (T-allele) has an asthma population attributable risk of 18.5%. The association between KIF3A rs7737031 and asthma was validated in 3 independent populations, further substantiating the validity of our gene selection approach. Conclusions/Significance Our study demonstrates that KIF3A, a member of the kinesin superfamily of microtubule associated motors that are important in the transport of protein complexes within cilia, is a novel candidate gene for childhood asthma. Polymorphisms in KIF3A may in part be responsible for poor mucus and/or allergen clearance from the airways. Furthermore, our study provides a promising framework for the identification and evaluation of novel candidate susceptibility genes."
https://openalex.org/W2093440200,"Exploration and novelty seeking are cross-species adaptive behaviors that are dysregulated in bipolar disorder (BD) and are critical features of the illness. While these behaviors have been extensively quantified in animals, multivariate human paradigms of exploration are lacking. The human Behavioral Pattern Monitor (hBPM), a human version of the animal open field, identified a signature pattern of hyper-exploration in manic BD patients, but whether exploratory behavior changes with treatment is unknown. The objective of this study was to assess the sensitivity of the hBPM to changes in manic symptoms, a necessary step towards elucidating the neurobiology underlying BD.Twelve acutely hospitalized manic BD subjects and 21 healthy volunteers were tested in the hBPM over three sessions; all subjects were retested one week after their first session and two weeks after their second session. Motor activity, spatial and entropic (degree of unpredictability) patterns of exploration, and interactions with novel objects were quantified. Manic BD patients demonstrated greater motor activity, extensive and more unpredictable patterns of exploration, and more object interactions than healthy volunteers during all three sessions. Exploration and novelty-seeking slightly decreased in manic BD subjects over the three sessions as their symptoms responded to treatment, but never to the level of healthy volunteers. Among healthy volunteers, exploration did not significantly decrease over time, and hBPM measures were highly correlated between sessions.Manic BD patients showed a modest reduction in symptoms yet still demonstrated hyper-exploration and novelty seeking in the hBPM, suggesting that these illness features may be enduring characteristics of BD. Furthermore, behavior in the hBPM is not subject to marked habituation effects. The hBPM can be reliably used in a repeated-measures design to characterize exploration and novelty seeking and, in parallel with animal studies, can contribute to developing treatments that target neuropsychiatric disease."
https://openalex.org/W2115738596,"Capsule and toxin are the major virulence factors of Bacillus anthracis. The B. anthracis pleiotropic regulator CodY activates toxin gene expression by post-translationally regulating the accumulation of the global regulator AtxA. However, the role of CodY on B. anthracis capsulation and virulence of encapsulated strains has been unknown. The role of CodY in B. anthracis virulence was studied in mouse and guinea pig models. Spore outgrowth and dissemination of the vegetative cells was followed in mice by bioluminescent imaging. We also determined the state of capsulation and the iron requirement for growth of the codY mutant. In all models tested, the codY mutant strain was strongly attenuated compared to the wild-type strain and, in mice, also compared to the atxA strain. The disruption of codY did not affect either ex vivo or in vivo capsulation, whereas atxA deletion affected ex vivo capsulation only. The disruption of codY led to a delayed initiation of dissemination but similar kinetics of subsequent spread of the bacilli. The codY mutant cannot grow on heme iron as sole iron source, whereas the parental and complemented strains can. The lack of CodY-mediated transcription weakens virulence by controlling iron acquisition and synthesis of toxin, but without modifying capsulation."
https://openalex.org/W1976396257,"Background Towards realistic estimations of the diversity of marine animals, tiny meiofaunal species usually are underrepresented. Since the biological species concept is hardly applicable on exotic and elusive animals, it is even more important to apply a morphospecies concept on the best level of information possible, using accurate and efficient methodology such as 3D modelling from histological sections. Molecular approaches such as sequence analyses may reveal further, cryptic species. This is the first case study on meiofaunal gastropods to test diversity estimations from traditional taxonomy against results from modern microanatomical methodology and molecular systematics. Results The examined meiofaunal Pseudunela specimens from several Indo-Pacific islands cannot be distinguished by external features. Their 3D microanatomy shows differences in the organ systems and allows for taxonomic separation in some cases. Additional molecular analyses based on partial mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI) and 16S rRNA markers revealed considerable genetic structure that is largely congruent with anatomical or geographical patterns. Two new species (Pseudunela viatoris and P. marteli spp. nov.) are formally described integrating morphological and genetic analyses. Phylogenetic analysis using partial 16S rRNA, COI and the nuclear 18S rRNA markers shows a clade of Pseudunelidae species as the sister group to limnic Acochlidiidae. Within Pseudunela, two subtypes of complex excretory systems occur. A complex kidney already evolved in the ancestor of Hedylopsacea. Several habitat shifts occurred during hedylopsacean evolution. Conclusions Cryptic species occur in tropical meiofaunal Pseudunela gastropods, and likely in other meiofaunal groups with poor dispersal abilities, boosting current diversity estimations. Only a combined 3D microanatomical and molecular approach revealed actual species diversity within Pseudunela reliably. Such integrative methods are recommended for all taxonomic approaches and biodiversity surveys on soft-bodied and small-sized invertebrates. With increasing taxon sampling and details studied, the evolution of acochlidian panpulmonates is even more complex than expected."
https://openalex.org/W1990315694,"One of the most striking aspects of animal groups is their remarkable variation in size, both within and between species. While a number of mechanistic models have been proposed to explain this variation, there are few comprehensive datasets against which these models have been tested. In particular, we only vaguely understand how environmental factors and behavioral activities affect group-size distributions. Here we use observations of House sparrows (Passer domesticus) to investigate the factors determining group-size distribution. Over a wide range of conditions, we observed that animal group sizes followed a single parameter distribution known as the logarithmic distribution. This single parameter is the mean group size experienced by a randomly chosen individual (including the individual itself). For sparrows, the experienced mean group size, and hence the distribution, was affected by four factors: morning temperature, place, behavior and the degree of food spillage. Our results further indicate that the sparrows regulate the mean group size they experience, either by groups splitting more or merging less when local densities are high. We suggest that the mean experienced group size provides a simple but general tool for assessing the ecology and evolution of grouping."
https://openalex.org/W2156396333,"Background Recent GWAS and subsequent confirmation studies reported several single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) at the CLU, CR1 and PICALM loci in association with late-onset Alzheimer's disease (AD). Parkinson disease (PD) shares several clinical and pathologic characteristics with AD; we therefore explored whether these SNPs were also associated with PD risk. Methodology/Principal Findings 791 non-Hispanic Whites cases and 1,580 matched controls were included in the study. Odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were obtained from logistic regression models. rs11136000 at the CLU locus was associated with PD risk under the recessive model (comparing TT versus CC+CT: OR = 0.71, 95% CI: 0.55-0.92, p = 0.008) after adjusting for year of birth, gender, smoking, and caffeine intake. Further adjustment for family history of PD and ApoE ε4 status did not change the result. In addition, we did not find evidence for effect modification by ApoE or known PD risk factors. The association, however, appeared to be stronger for PD with dementia (OR = 0.49, 95% CI: 0.27-0.91) than for PD without dementia (OR = 0.81, 95% CI: 0.61-1.06). The two other SNPs, rs6656401 from CR1, and rs3851179 from PICALM region were not associated with PD (p>0.05). Conclusion Our exploratory analysis suggests an association of CLU with PD. This exploratory finding and the role of dementia in explaining this finding needs further investigation."
https://openalex.org/W2089063401,"The sesquiterpene (E)-ß-farnesene is the main component of the alarm pheromone system of various aphid species studied to date, including the English grain aphid, Sitobion avenae. Aphid natural enemies, such as the marmalade hoverfly Episyrphus balteatus and the multicolored Asian lady beetle Harmonia axyridis, eavesdrop on aphid chemical communication and utilize (E)-ß-farnesene as a kairomone to localize their immediate or offspring preys. These aphid-predator systems are important models to study how the olfactory systems of distant insect taxa process the same chemical signal. We postulated that odorant-binding proteins (OBPs), which are highly expressed in insect olfactory tissues and involved in the first step of odorant reception, have conserved regions involved in binding (E)-ß-farnesene.We cloned OBP genes from the English grain aphid and two major predators of this aphid species. We then expressed these proteins and compare their binding affinities to the alarm pheromone/kairomone. By using a fluorescence reporter, we tested binding of (E)-ß-farnesene and other electrophysiologically and behaviorally active compounds, including a green leaf volatile attractant.We found that OBPs from disparate taxa of aphids and their predators are highly conserved proteins, with apparently no orthologue genes in other insect species. Properly folded, recombinant proteins from the English grain aphid, SaveOBP3, and the marmalade hoverfly, EbalOBP3, specifically bind (E)-ß-farnesene with apparent high affinity. For the first time we have demonstrated that insect species belonging to distinct Orders have conserved OBPs, which specifically bind a common semiochemical and has no binding affinity for related compounds."
https://openalex.org/W1972178554,"Promoter recognition is the first and the most important step during gene expression. Our studies of the yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) mitochondrial (mt) transcription machinery provide mechanistic understandings on the basic problem of how the mt RNA polymerase (RNAP) with the help of the initiation factor discriminates between promoter and non-promoter sequences. We have used fluorescence-based approaches to quantify DNA binding, bending, and opening steps by the core mtRNAP subunit (Rpo41) and the transcription factor (Mtf1). Our results show that promoter recognition is not achieved by tight and selective binding to the promoter sequence. Instead, promoter recognition is achieved by an induced-fit mechanism of transcription factor-dependent differential conformational changes in the promoter and non-promoter DNAs. While Rpo41 induces a slight bend upon binding both the DNAs, addition of the Mtf1 results in severe bending of the promoter and unbending of the non-promoter DNA. Only the sharply bent DNA results in the catalytically active open complex. Such an induced-fit mechanism serves three purposes: 1) assures catalysis at promoter sites, 2) prevents RNA synthesis at non-promoter sites, and 3) provides a conformational state at the non-promoter sites that would aid in facile translocation to scan for specific sites."

https://openalex.org/W2047110825,"Fanconi anemia (FA), an inherited disease, is associated with progressive bone marrow failure, predisposition to cancer, and genomic instability. Genes corresponding to 15 identified FA complementation groups have been cloned, and each gene product functions in the response to DNA damage induced by cross-linking agents and/or in protection against genome instability. Interestingly, overproduction of inflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) and aberrant activation of NF-κB-dependent transcriptional activity have been observed in FA cells. Here we demonstrated that FANCD2 protein inhibits NF-κB activity in its monoubiquitination-dependent manner. Furthermore, we detected a specific association between FANCD2 and an NF-κB consensus element in the TNF-α promoter by electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA) and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay. Therefore, we propose FANCD2 deficiency promotes transcriptional activity of the TNF-α promoter and induces overproduction of TNF-which then sustains prolonged inflammatory responses. These results also suggest that artificial modulation of TNFα production could be a promising therapeutic approach to FA."
https://openalex.org/W2059049514,"Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are a family of proteins that act as the primary sensors of microbial products. Many TLRs require accessory molecules in order to recognize these microbial products and initiate signal transduction cascades. We have identified TRIL (TLR4 interactor with leucine-rich repeats) as a novel modulator of TLR4 signaling showing high expression in the brain. We now show that TRIL also plays a role in TLR3 signaling. TRIL is expressed intracellularly in the astrocytoma cell line U373 and in the monocytic cell line THP1. TRIL co-localizes with the endosomal compartment. These data are consistent with a role for TRIL in TLR3 signaling and endosomal TLR4 signaling. TRIL was induced by the TLR3 ligand poly(I:C). Overexpression of TRIL enhanced cytokine production and interferon-stimulated response element (ISRE) luciferase activity following poly(I:C) stimulation in U373. TRIL interacted with TLR3, and this interaction was enhanced following poly(I:C) stimulation. Transient knockdown of TRIL with siRNA or stable knockdown using shRNA in U373 cells inhibited TLR3 signaling, reducing ISRE luciferase, RANTES, and type I interferon production. Knockdown of TRIL did not affect TLR2 signaling. Most accessory molecules identified to date, such as CD14, gp96, PRAT4a, and Unc93B, all play roles in multiple TLR signaling pathways, and we now show that this is also the case for TRIL.

Immunol. Today. 1992; 13: 11-16Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1016) Google Scholar). TLR4, -1, -2, and -6 are expressed on the surface of cells and recognize microbial products, such as LPS and lipopeptides, whereas TLR3, -7, -8, and -9 are expressed intracellularly and are involved in the recognition of nucleic acids (3Carpenter S. O'Neill L.A. Biochem. J. 2009; 422: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). The subcellular localization of TLRs is optimized for recognition of microbial products and results in the activation of a specific type of transcriptional response. TLRs activated at the plasma membrane engage MyD88, leading to the activation of NFκB, resulting in the production of proinflammatory cytokines. In contrast, the intracellular TLRs (TLR7, -8, and -9) all associate with MyD88 and lead to the activation of IRF7, resulting in the production of type I interferons. TLR3 engages the adaptor molecule TRIF in order to activate the production of type I interferons (4Alexopoulou L. Holt A.C. Medzhitov R. Flavell R.A. Nature. 2001; 413: 732-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (4796) Google Scholar). In addition, TLR4 has been found to traffic to the early endosome. At the plasma membrane, TLR4 engages with MyD88 and signals to activate NFκB. When TLR4 is endocytosed, it binds TRIF, resulting in the production of type 1 interferons (5Kagan J.C. Su T. Horng T.

Toll-like receptor regulated on activation normal T cell expressed and secreted N-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycine thymidine kinase interferon-stimulated response element. In order for the TLR signaling complexes to function, they require a number of accessory molecules (6McGettrick A.F. O'Neill L.A. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 2010; 22: 20-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). Some accessory proteins function at the level of regulation at the cell surface, such as MD-2. Both MD-2 and TLR4 bind to LPS and initiate signaling (7Park B.S. Song D.H. Kim H.M. Choi B.S. Lee H. Lee J.O. Nature. 2009; 458: 1191-1195Crossref PubMed Scopus (1500) Google Scholar). MD-2 knock-out mice fail to respond to LPS, further emphasizing the important role MD-2 plays in this response (8Nagai Y. Akashi S. Nagafuku M. Ogata M. Iwakura Y. Akira S. Kitamura T. Kosugi A. Kimoto M. Miyake K. Nat. Immunol. 2002; 3: 667-672Crossref PubMed Scopus (827) Google Scholar). RP-105 also functions at the cell surface, where it appears to have contrasting roles, which are cell type-specific. RP105 is required by TLR4 and TLR2 for responses in B cells (9Ogata H. Su I.

In contrast, in macrophages and dendritic cells, RP105 plays the role of a negative regulator (10Divanovic S. Trompette A. Atabani S.F. Madan R. Golenbock D.T. Visintin A. Finberg R.W. Tarakhovsky A.

Cells were cultured in DMEM for 10 days prior to treatment. U373 parental cells were used for stable cell line generation. U373 cells were transfected using GeneJuice® (Novagen). Cells were maintained in DMEM supplemented with FCS and 1% (v/v) penicillin-streptomycin solution. Cells stably transfected with pcDNA3.1 TRIL-V5 were selected and cloned using 300 μg/ml neomycin analog G418 (Invivogen). Overexpression of TRIL was confirmed by immunoblotting and confocal analysis. U373 WT and U373/TRIL cells were seeded at 2 × 105 cells/ml in 10-cm dishes. After 24 h, cells were harvested and placed in membrane resuspension buffer (20 mm Tris·Cl, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 250 μm sucrose, and 200 μm PMSF) and subjected to 30 strokes of a tight fitting Dounce homogenizer. In order to separate the cytosolic and membrane fractions, the homogenate was centrifuged at 90,000 × g for 1 h. 5× sample buffer was added to both the cytosolic and membrane fractions, which were then immunoblotted for TRIL expression using a V5 antibody. For quantitative real-time PCR, cDNA was transcribed using the High Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription kit (Applied Biosystems). Primers and probes for human cDNA were purchased from Applied Biosystems (assay ID Hs00274460_s1). siRNA was carried out in U373 cells as previously described (1Carpenter S. Carlson T.

The shRNAmir individual clone was purchased from Open Biosystems (ID V2THS_95531, RHS4743). 293T cells were seeded at 2 × 105 cells/ml in 10-cm dishes. Plasmids encoding shRNA, TRIL (4 μg), or non-silencing control (4 μg) and viral proteins pSPAX2 (3 μg) and pMD2 (1 μg) were transfected into 293T cells using GeneJuice according to the manufacturer's protocol. After 48 h post-transfection, viruses containing supernatants were harvested and replaced with fresh media. Collected supernatants were centrifuged, filtrated with 0.2-μm filters, and stored at 4 °C. The harvesting step was repeated after 24 h, and supernatants were mixed together. U373 or THP1 target cells were plated at 2 × 105 cells/ml in 10-cm dishes. After 24 h, cells were replated with 50% DMEM (U373) or RPMI (THP1) culture medium with 10% (v/v) FCS and 1% (v/v) penicillin-streptomycin solution and 50% harvested virus-containing supernatants. 4 μg of Polybrene (Sigma) was added into the cells. Transduced cells were cultured for 48 h. Puromycin selection (3 μg/ml) was initiated after another 48 h. U373 stable TRIL knockdown cells and the non-silencing control cell line were maintained in DMEM. THP1-stable TRIL knockdown cells were maintained in RMPI. All media contained 10% (v/v) FCS, 1% (v/v) penicillin-streptomycin solution, and 3 μg/ml puromycin. Cells were stimulated for 48 h using 1 or 2 μg of doxycycline in order to activate the shRNA. U373 cells were seeded at 2 × 105 cells/ml in 12-well plates. Plasmids encoding TLR3 (10 pg), TRIL (10 pg), or both together were transfected into U373 cells using GeneJuice. After 24 h, cells were stimulated with 25 μg/ml poly(I:C). Supernatants were removed. HEKblue cells (Invivogen) are a specially designed cell line containing a reporter gene expressing a secreted embryonic alkaline phosphatase under the control of the IFN-α/β-inducible ISG54 promoter. Stimulation of the cells results in the activation of the JAK-STAT pathway and subsequently the expression of the reporter gene. Secreted embryonic alkaline phosphatase is secreted in the supernatant and is easily detectable when using QUANTI-BlueTM, a medium that turns purple/blue in the presence of secreted embryonic alkaline phosphatase. Measurements were taken at 625 nm. U373 cells were seeded in 24-well plates at 1 × 105 cells/ml, incubated overnight, and transfected using GeneJuice transfection reagent (Novagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. 160 ng of ISRE or κB luciferase plasmid and 80 ng of Renilla luciferase, with the indicated amount of TRIL pcDNA, TLR3 pcDNA, or both together were transfected into each well of a 24-well plate. The equivalent amount of empty pcDNA3.1 vector was added as a control in addition to ensuring equal quantities of DNA in each well. Cells were lysed in 100 μl of passive lysis buffer (Promega) for 15 min. Firefly luciferase activity was assayed by the addition of 40 μl of luciferase assay mix (20 mm Tricine, 1.07 mm (MgCO3)4Mg(OH)2·5H2O, 2.67 m MgSO4, 0.1 mm EDTA, 33.3 mm dithiothreitol, 270 mm coenzyme A, 470 mm luciferin, 530 mm ATP) to 20 μl of the lysed sample. Renilla luciferase was read by the addition of 40 μl of a 1:1000 dilution of coelentrazine (Argus Fine Chemicals) in phosphate-buffered saline. Luminescence was read using the Reporter microplate luminometer (Turner Designs). The Renilla luciferase plasmid was used to normalize for transfection efficiency in all experiments. U373 cells were seeded at 2 × 105 cells/ml in 10-cm dishes. FLAG-TLR3 (pcDNA3.1), FLAG-TLR2 (pcDNA3.1), or empty vector control (pcDNA3.1) was transfected in using GeneJuice transfection reagent (Novagen). Cells were treated as outlined in the figure legends. Cells were washed in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in 500 μl of high stringency lysis buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 1% Nonidet P-40). Supernatants were removed and added to the relevant precoupled antibody. 50 μl of each lysate was retained to confirm expression of TRIL and TLR3. Samples were incubated overnight at 4 °C. Following incubation, the immune complexes were washed twice with 1 ml of lysis buffer and once with ice-cold PBS. All supernatants were removed, and beads were resuspended in 30 μl of 5× sample buffer. The samples were boiled for 5 min, and SDS-PAGE analysis was performed as described previously. U373 cells were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% (v/v) FCS and 1% (v/v) penicillin-streptomycin solution. Cells were seeded on 35-mm glass-bottomed tissue cell dishes (MatTek) and were transfected with expression plasmids using GeneJuice (Novagene), prior to a 2h stimulation with poly(I:C) (Invivogen). Poly(I:C) was used at a concentration of 25 μg/ml. A point scanning confocal microscope with a heated stage was used for imaging (Olympus FV1000 LSM confocal microscope (numerical aperture, 1.4; ×60)). THP-1 cells were seeded at 2.5 million cells/ml (Matek dish). Phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate was added (1:80,000), and cells were incubated for 24 h. Cells were transfected using Lipofectamine (Lipofectamine 2000, Invitrogen). 24 h following transfection, cells were treated with Hoechst 1:20,000 (30-min incubation) and CellMask 1:1000 (plasma membrane stain) (Invitrogen). A point scanning confocal microscope with a heated stage was used for imaging (Olympus FV1000 LSM confocal microscope (numerical aperture, 1.4; ×60)). Confocal images were analyzed using FluoView FV1000 confocal microscope software. Colocalization of TRIL-V5 (green channel) and endogenous TLR3 (red channel) was described quantitatively. Pearson's correlation coefficient, overlap coefficient, and colocalization coefficient for both red and green channels were employed to evaluate colocalization. Pearson's correlation coefficient is one of the standard measures in pattern recognition. It is used to describe the correlation of the intensity distributions between channels. Pearson's correlation coefficient estimates the correlation based on similarity between shapes. It ranges in value from 1 to −1. A value of 1 represents perfect correlation, −1 represents perfect exclusion, and 0 represents random localization. Values close to 1 indicate that there is reliable colocalization. The overlap coefficient represents an overlap of the signals from red and green channels. Values of the overlap coefficient are defined from 0 to 1, with 1 being high and 0 being low colocalization. U373 cells were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% (v/v) FCS and 1% (v/v) penicillin-streptomycin solution. Cells were seeded on coverslips coated with poly-l-lysine (Sigma). Cells were transfected with 1 μg of expression plasmid TRIL/RFP using GeneJuice (Novagen) and after 24 h were stimulated for 2 h with 25 μg/ml poly(I:C) (Invivogen). U373 cells were permeabilized and fixed using the FIX&PERM® cell permeabilization kit (ADG). Cells were then stained using primary goat anti-human endogenous TLR3 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) and secondary donkey anti-goat 488 antibody (Invitrogen). U373-TRIL V5 stables were seeded on poly-l-lysine-coated slides 24 h prior to stimulation at a concentration of 0.1 × 106/well. Cells were stimulated with 25 μg/ml PIC for 0, 1, 4, and 24 h, respectively. Medium was removed, and samples were fixed using 3.7% formaldehyde at pH 7.0 for 10 min. Samples were permeabilized using 0.2% Triton X-100 for 5 min. Cells were stained using anti-V5 FITC (rabbit polyclonal antibody to V5-FITC (Abcam) (green) and anti-TLR3 (goat polyclonal antibody to TLR3; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.). Slides were mounted with ProLong Gold antifade reagent with DAPI (Invitrogen). THP-1 cells were seeded at 1 × 106 cells/ml in 6-well plates. Cells were transfected using Lipofectamine with 1 μg of FLAG-TLR2 and 1 μg of TRIL RFP. 24 h following transfection, cells were transferred to fibronectin (Sigma)-coated slides. Samples were fixed and permeabilized using the fix and perm kit. FLAG-TLR2 staining was carried out using anti-Flag (murine monoclonal antibody M2, Sigma), followed by Alexa-488 (green) anti-mouse antibody. Slides were mounted with ProLong Gold antifade reagent with DAPI (Invitrogen). The Olympus FV1000 LSM confocal microscope (numerical aperture, 1.4; ×60) was used to take images. 1 × 107 U373/TRIL cells were resuspended in FACS buffer (PBS, 5% FCS, 0.05% sodium azide). 1 ml of blocking buffer (50% FCS, 50% FACS buffer) was added to the cells at room temperature for 30 min. Cells were centrifuged and resuspended in 1 ml of FACS buffer. 100 μl of cell suspension was added to a FACS tube. For each sample to be analyzed, a 1:250 dilution of midregion, C-terminal anti-TRIL antibody was added or the appropriate isotype control. N-terminal, C-terminal, and midregion antibodies were obtained from 21st Century Biochemicals and were affinity-purified. The use of TRIL antibodies has been described previously (1Carpenter S. Carlson T. Dellacasagrande J. Garcia A. Gibbons S. Hertzog P. Lyons A. Lin L.L. Lynch M. Monie T. Murphy C. Seidl K.J. Wells C. Dunne A. O'Neill L.A. J. Immunol. 2009; 183: 3989-3995Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Samples were kept on ice for 20 min. 3 ml of FACS buffer was added to each sample and centrifuged for 5 min at 1,200 rpm. Supernatants were removed, and this procedure was repeated three times. 100 μl of FACS buffer was added to each sample. 100 μl of conjugated secondary antibody (anti-rabbit) was added to each sample and kept on ice for 20 min. Samples were washed as described previously, resuspended in 500 μl of sheath fluid, analyzed on a FACSCaliber flow cytometer. For intracellular staining, additional fixation and permeabilization steps were included (using the FIX&PERM kit as described by the manufacturer, Calbiochem). We have previously shown that TRIL contains 13 leucine rich repeats, a type III fibronectin domain, a signal peptide, and a putative transmembrane domain (1Carpenter S. Carlson T. Dellacasagrande J. Garcia A. Gibbons S. Hertzog P. Lyons A. Lin L.L. Lynch M. Monie T. Murphy C. Seidl K.J. Wells C. Dunne A. O'Neill L.A. J. Immunol. 2009; 183: 3989-3995Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Following on from this work, we decided to investigate the subcellular localization of TRIL in more detail using antibodies we raised to the N terminus, C terminus, and midregion of TRIL (1Carpenter S. Carlson T. Dellacasagrande J. Garcia A. Gibbons S. Hertzog P. Lyons A. Lin L.L. Lynch M. Monie T. Murphy C. Seidl K.J. Wells C. Dunne A. O'Neill L.A. J. Immunol. 2009; 183: 3989-3995Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Unfortunately, the N-terminal antibody was not sensitive enough for FACS analysis or Western blotting of endogenous or overexpressed protein and therefore was not used. The C-terminal and midregion antibodies were not sensitive enough to pick up endogenous protein by FACS analysis; therefore, we examined localization in U373 cells stably overexpressing TRIL. We can see in Fig. 1A that TRIL was not detected on the cell surface by FACS. Permeabilizing the cells, however, revealed TRIL internally in Fig. 1B. Although both the midregion and C-terminal antibody detect TRIL by flow cytometry, it appears that C-terminal antibody (in purple) is a more sensitive antibody for detecting TRIL in U373 cells compared with the midregion antibody (blue). Surprisingly, in HEK 293 cells, overexpressed TRIL localizes to the cell surface, as observed using the midregion antibody to TRIL (Fig. 1C). TRIL antibodies were not sensitive enough for confocal analysis; therefore, we obtained GFP-, RFP-, and YFP-tagged TRIL plasmids. Fig. 1D shows that TRIL-YFP was localized intracellularly in U373 cells, and no colocalization of TRIL with the cell surface marker (cell mask) was observed. Similar localization of TRIL-GFP was also detected in THP1 cells (Fig. 1E). In addition, we generated a U373 cell line expressing TRIL with a V5 tag. Membrane fractionation studies were carried out on wild type and U373/TRIL cells, and we found that TRIL was mainly localized to the membrane fraction (Fig. 1F, lane 4, top). In order to determine the exact intracellular membrane on which TRIL is expressed, we used confocal microscopy and found that in U373/TRIL cells, the protein could co-localize with the early endosomal markers Rab5 (Fig. 1G) and EEA1 (Fig. 1H). Again, in HEK 293 cells, overexpressed TRIL showed a different pattern of expression and was found mainly to localize on the plasma membrane, as shown by the co-localization of TRIL-GFP with the cell mask stain in Fig. 1I. The localization results indicate that TRIL is expressed endosomally in U373 cells. This led us to examine if, in addition to its role in TLR4 signaling, it might also play a role in TLR3 signaling. To investigate this, we studied TRIL induction following poly(I:C) stimulation. We found that at the mRNA level, TRIL was induced in bone marrow-derived macrophages and U373 cells following poly(I:C) stimulation (Fig. 2, A and B, respectively). At the protein level, we see a time-dependent induction of TRIL in both rat mixed glial cells and U373 cells (Fig. 2, C and D). As shown previously, TRIL migrated as a doublet. The effect in the rat mixed glial cells was evident from 2 h, the faster migrating form of TRIL being particularly induced. In U373, the effect was from 1 h, and the slower migrating form was especially enhanced. U373 cells are capable of responding moderately to poly(I:C) stimulation. Therefore, we sought to investigate what effect transient transfection of TLR3 or TRIL would have on responses to poly(I:C). Initially, we observed that overexpression of 1 ng of plasmid encoding either TLR3 or TRIL alone gave a similar modest increase in induction of an ISRE luciferase construct following poly(I:C) stimulation (Fig. 3A). In order to determine if there is cooperation between TRIL and TLR3, we reduced the doses of transfected plasmid to 10 pg. We found that either TRIL alone or TLR3 at this low concentration provided minimal increased response to poly(I:C). However, at these low concentrations, when TRIL and TLR3 were transfected together, a significant increase in induction of ISRE and RANTES production was observed (Fig. 3, B and C). To follow on from the transient results, we generated U373 cells stably overexpressing TRIL. We initially generated a pool of U373/TRIL cells, and in addition, we isolated two clones from the stable pool. As expected and as reported previously (1Carpenter S. Carlson T. Dellacasagrande J. Garcia A. Gibbons S. Hertzog P. Lyons A. Lin L.L. Lynch M. Monie T. Murphy C. Seidl K.J. Wells C. Dunne A. O'Neill L.A. J. Immunol. 2009; 183: 3989-3995Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), we observed an enhanced IL-6 and RANTES response to LPS in the U373/TRIL pool cells (Fig. 4, A and D). These cells and the U373/TRIL stable clone cells also displayed enhanced IL-6 and RANTES production as well as an increase in ISRE and κB luciferase activity in response to poly(I:C) stimulation (Fig. 4, B, C, E, F, G, and H).FIGURE 4TRIL modulates responses to LPS and poly(I:C). U373 cell lines stably expressing TRIL were generated. U373/TRIL cells represent pools of stably overexpressing TRIL, and U373/TRIL clone 1 and clone 2 are individual clone cell lines derived from U373/TRIL pool cells. Cells were maintained in complete media prior to stimulation with the indicated concentration of LPS or poly(I:C) for 24 h. RANTES (A–C) and IL-6 (D–F) levels were measured by ELISA. Results are expressed as mean ± S.D. for triplicate determinations. U373 cells were transfected with plasmids encoding ISRE luciferase (G), κB luciferase (H), and TK Renilla for 24 h. Cells were stimulated with 25 μg/ml poly(I:C) for 24 h. Luciferase activity was measured where results for TK Renilla were normalized and represented as -fold stimulation over non-stimulated controls. In all cases, results are expressed as mean ± S.D. for triplicate determinants and are representative of three separate experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Because overexpression of TRIL enhances TLR3 signaling, we next sought to determine if TRIL is capable of associating with TLR3. As shown in Fig. 5A (lane 3), endogenous TRIL could bind FLAG-tagged TLR3 and not FLAG-tagged TLR2 (Fig. 5A, lane 5). As an additional control, we show that TRIL is unable to co-localize with TLR2 in THP1 cells (Fig. 5B) by confocal microscopy. Because TRIL appears to be localized to the endosome and it is known that TLR3 is endosomally located, we also examined and observed co-localization of TLR3 and TRIL in U373 cells (Fig. 5C) by confocal microscopy. This interaction was very strong at basal levels and displayed a trend toward increased interaction following poly(I:C) stimulation, reaching statistical significance at 24 h poststimulation (Fig. 5C). To further confirm this finding, we show in Fig. 5D by Western blotting that there was an increase in the interaction between TRIL and TLR3 following poly(I:C) stimulation. Finally, we performed siRNA and shRNA knockdown of TRIL to determine the effects this would have on TLR3 signaling in U373 cells. siRNA knockdown of TRIL was optimized previously (1Carpenter S. Carlson T. Dellacasagrande J. Garcia A. Gibbons S. Hertzog P. Lyons A. Lin L.L. Lynch M. Monie T. Murphy C. Seidl K.J. Wells C. Dunne A. O'Neill L.A. J. Immunol. 2009; 183: 3989-3995Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Knockdown of TRIL in U373 cells was confirmed by real-time PCR (Fig. 6A). Silencing of TRIL affected the TLR3 signaling pathway by decreasing the production of RANTES and IFNα/β production in response to poly(I:C) stimulation (Fig. 6, B and C). To further confirm the results from transient knockdown of TRIL, we generated stable U373 cell line expressing a TET-inducible shRNA specific to TRIL. shRNA was activated following the addition of doxycycline. Knockdown of TRIL was confirmed by Western blot (Fig. 6D) and also by PCR (Fig. 6E). TLR3 expression levels were unaffected by the knockdown of TRIL (Fig. 6E, right). Treatment of cells with 2 μg/ml doxycycline led to the greatest decrease in TRIL; therefore, we choose this concentration for the functional assays. Fig. 6, F and G, shows that knockdown of TRIL leads to a significant reduction in ISRE luciferase and RANTES production both in untransfected cells and even more dramatically in cells expressing 10 pg/ml TLR3. As a control to confirm that doxycycline alone does not exert any effects on the cells, we stably transfected cells with a non-silencing control pTRIPZ plasmid. Fig. 6H shows that doxycycline treatment alone does not have any effect on the ability of cells to respond to poly(I:C) stimulation. As additional controls to show specificity for TRIL to the TLR3 and TLR4 signaling pathways, we attempted to treat U373/TRIL stable knockdown cells with a wide range of ligands. Unfortunately, U373 cells do not respond to IL-1β or R848, as demonstrated for κB and ISRE luciferases (Fig. 6, I and J). We also attempted to stimulate U373 cells with CpGb, flagellin, and MDP but did not observe a response (data not shown). We have previously shown that TRIL knockdown had a modest effect on TLR2 signaling in peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Unfortunately, we were unable to examine TLR2 responses in U373s because TLR2 is not expressed in these cells. In order to determine if TRIL is specific to TLR3 and TLR4 signaling, we generated a THP1 monocytic cell line expressing the TET-inducible shRNA to TRIL. As expected, these cells showed reduced responses to LPS stimulation (Fig. 7A). Knockdown of TRIL did not have any effect on TLR2-mediated TNF-α production after 3- and 24-h stimulation with Pam3Cys4 (Fig. 7, B and C) or on RANTES production (Fig. 7D). We found that THP1 cells do not express TLR3 by real-time PCR (data not shown); therefore, we could not test poly(I:C) responses in these cells. Overall, the localization of TRIL, along with the enhanced responses to poly(I:C) stimulation when TRIL is overexpressed, in addition to the decrease in response when TRIL is knocked down all indicate that TRIL is an important component of the TLR3 signaling pathway. In addition to its role in TLR4 signaling, we demonstrate that TRIL is also important for TLR3 signaling. In the human astrocytoma cell line U373 and the human monocytic cell line THP1, TRIL is found to localize inside the cell. Interestingly, localization studies using HEK 293 cells stably overexpressing TRIL indicate that TRIL is expressed on the cell surface and co-localizes with the plasma membrane. It is possible that TRIL expression in HEK293 cells is mislocalized, or it could be that TRIL displays differential expression patterns, which are cell type-specific. In U373 cells where TRIL shows an endosomal localization pattern, we confirm that indeed TRIL can co-localize with the early endosomal markers EEA1 and Rab5. We were unable to ensure the localization of endogenously expressed TRIL by flow cytometry due to the limitations of our antibodies. The intracellular localization of TRIL in U373 and THP1 cells led us to investigate if TRIL might in fact play a role in other TLR signaling pathways. We had already ruled out TLR9 as a candidate because knockdown of TRIL using siRNA did not affect the TLR9 signaling pathway (1Carpenter S. Carlson T. Dellacasagrande J. Garcia A. Gibbons S. Hertzog P. Lyons A. Lin L.L. Lynch M. Monie T. Murphy C. Seidl K.J. Wells C. Dunne A. O'Neill L.A. J. Immunol. 2009; 183: 3989-3995Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). We next examined whether TRIL was involved in TLR3 signaling. TRIL has previously been shown to be an LPS-inducible gene. Here we show that at both the RNA and protein level, TRIL can be induced by poly(I:C) stimulation in bone marrow-derived macrophages, U373 cells, and primary rat mixed glial cells. Transient overexpression of 1 ng of TRIL enhanced ISRE responses to poly(I:C) stimulation to the same extent as overexpression of 1 ng of TLR3. When a lower concentration of either TLR3 or TRIL was transfected into U373 cells alone, it did not greatly enhance the responses to poly(I:C). However, at these low concentrations, when both TRIL and TLR3 were transfected, they gave a significant boost in ISRE activation as well as RANTES production from U373 cells. These results would suggest that at higher concentrations, either protein alone provides an enhanced response, whereas at lower concentrations, both contribute together to provide marked increases in response to stimulation. We believe that the function of TRIL is to enhance the response of TLR3 to stimulation. Cells stably expressing TRIL also show enhanced responses to both LPS and poly(I:C) stimulation, providing further evidence that TRIL is playing a role in both pathways. In addition, we also show that TRIL is capable of binding and co-localizing with TLR3 in U373 cells. Knockdown both transiently by siRNA and stably by shRNA indicates the importance of TRIL for TLR3-mediated signaling. TRIL does not appear to play a role in TLR2-mediated signaling in THP1 cells. This provides another level of specificity indicating that TRIL is important for TLR4 and TLR3 and not TLR2- or TLR9-mediated immune responses. As mentioned earlier, many accessory molecules play roles in a number of TLR signaling pathways, and this has also been shown to be the case for CD14. CD14 has long been associated as an accessory molecule associated with enhanced responses to LPS; however, it now also appears to play a role in signaling by TLR3 and more recently in TLR7 and TLR9 (16Lee H.K. Dunzendorfer S. Soldau K. Tobias P.S. Immunity. 2006; 24: 153-163Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar, 17Baumann C.L. Aspalter I.M. Sharif O. Pichlmair A. Blüml S. Grebien F. Bruckner M. Pasierbek P. Aumayr K. Planyavsky M. Bennett K.L. Colinge J. Knapp S. Superti-Furga G. J. Exp. Med. 2010; 207: 2689-2701Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). In the case of TLR3, the role of CD14 appears to be as a molecule that enhances responses of TLR3 to poly(I:C) stimulation. The main role for CD14 appears to be in aiding the uptake of dsRNA into the cell, and like TRIL, CD14 can bind directly to TLR3 in endosomes (16Lee H.K. Dunzendorfer S. Soldau K. Tobias P.S. Immunity. 2006; 24: 153-163Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). In many ways, TRIL appears to act similarly to CD14; however, whether it is capable of interacting directly with dsRNA remains to be examined. We are currently investigating the exact role of TRIL as an accessory molecule, whether it is functioning at the level of ligand binding or indeed if it is acting more as a chaperone protein. One might ask why both TRIL and CD14 carry out similar functions. Perhaps this might be answered by examining the cell types that express these proteins. As mentioned previously, TRIL is highly expressed throughout the cell populations of the brain; in contrast, CD14 is most highly expressed on myeloid cell types (data available from the BioGPS Web site). Perhaps the main functions of TRIL lie in the central nervous system; therefore, TRIL may compensate for CD14 in the brain. Further investigation is needed to answer these questions. We have preliminary data indicating that TRIL is overexpressed in post-mortem samples from brains of patients with Alzheimer disease (data not shown). Rabin et al. (18Rabin S.J. Kim J.M. Baughn M. Libby R.T. Kim Y.J. Fan Y. Libby R.T. La Spada A. Stone B. Ravits J. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2010; 19: 313-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) identified TRIL (referred to as KIAA0644) as a protein that is overexpressed in the CNS of patients suffering from amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, a fatal neurodegenerative disease that is characterized by weakness resulting from loss of motor neurons. There is increasing interest in the relationship between activation of the innate immune system and the progression of neurodegenerative diseases. This, together with our data, further emphasizes the potentially important role TRIL plays in inflammatory pathways within the central nervous system.

https://openalex.org/W1966179055,"Background The suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), the master circadian clock, is a heterogeneous oscillator network, yet displays a robust synchronization dynamics. Recent single-cell bioluminescent imaging revealed temporal gradients in circadian clock gene expression in the SCN ex vivo. However, due to technical difficulty in biological approaches to elucidate the entire network structure of the SCN, characteristics of the gradient, which we refer to as phase wave, remain unknown. Methodology/Principal Findings We implemented new approaches, i.e., quantitative analysis and model simulation to characterize the phase waves in Per2::Luciferase clock reporter gene expression of the rat SCN slice. Our quantitative study demonstrated not only a high degree of synchronization between the neurons and regular occurrence of the phase wave propagation, but also a significant amount of phase fluctuations contained in the wave. In addition, our simulations based on local coupling model suggest that the intercellular coupling strength estimated by the model simulations is significantly higher than the critical value for generating the phase waves. Model simulations also suggest that heterogeneity of the SCN neurons is one of the main factors causing the phase wave fluctuations. Furthermore, robustness of the SCN network against dynamical noise and variation of the natural frequencies inherent in these neurons was quantitatively assessed. Conclusions/Significance To our knowledge, this is the first quantitative evaluation of the phase wave and further characterization of the SCN neuronal network features generating the wave i.e., intercellular synchrony, phase fluctuation, strong local coupling, heterogeneous periodicity and robustness. Our present study provides an approach, which will lead to a comprehensive understanding of mechanistic and/or biological significance of the phase wave in the central circadian oscillatory system."
https://openalex.org/W2037082039,"The objective of our work was to verify the value of the vegetation corridor in the conservation of small mammals in fragmented tropical landscapes, using a model system in the southeastern Minas Gerais. We evaluated and compared the composition and structure of small mammals in a vegetation corridor, forest fragments and a coffee matrix. A total of 15 species were recorded, and the highest species richness was observed in the vegetation corridor (13 species), followed by the forest fragments (10) and the coffee matrix (6). The absolute abundance was similar between the vegetation corridor and fragments (F = 22.94; p = 0.064), and the greatest differences occurred between the vegetation corridor and the matrix (F = 22.94; p = 0.001) and the forest fragments and the matrix (F = 22.94; p = 0.007). Six species showed significant habitat preference possibly related to the sensitivity of the species to the forest disturbance. Marmosops incanus was the species most sensitive to disturbance; Akodon montensis, Cerradomys subflavus, Gracilinanus microtarsus and Rhipidomys sp. displayed little sensitivity to disturbance, with a high relative abundance in the vegetation corridor. Calomys sp. was the species least affected by habitat disturbance, displaying a high relative abundance in the coffee matrix. Although the vegetation corridors are narrow (4 m width), our results support the hypothesis in which they work as a forest extension, share most species with the forest fragment and support species richness and abundance closer to forest fragments than to the coffee matrix. Our work highlights the importance and cost-effectiveness of these corridors to biodiversity management in the fragmented Atlantic Forest landscapes and at the regional level."

An intriguing question is whether the population of cells from her own mother can influence either maternal health during pregnancy and/or the next generation (grandchildren).Microchimerism from a woman's (i.e. proband's) own mother (mother-of-the-proband, MP) was studied in peripheral blood samples from women followed longitudinally during pregnancy who were confirmed to have uncomplicated obstetric outcomes. Women with preeclampsia were studied at the time of diagnosis and comparison made to women with healthy pregnancies matched for parity and gestational age. Participants and family members were HLA-genotyped for DRB1, DQA1, and DQB1 loci. An HLA polymorphism unique to the woman's mother was identified, and a panel of HLA-specific quantitative PCR assays was employed to identify and quantify microchimerism. Microchimerism from the MP was identified during normal, uncomplicated pregnancy, with a peak concentration in the third trimester. The likelihood of detection increased with advancing gestational age. For each advancing trimester, there was a 12.7-fold increase in the probability of detecting microchimerism relative to the prior trimester, 95% confidence intervals 3.2, 50.3, p<0.001. None of the women with preeclampsia, compared with 30% of matched healthy women, had microchimerism (p = 0.03).These results show that microchimerism from a woman's own mother is detectable in normal pregnancy and diminished in preeclampsia, supporting the previously unexplored hypothesis that MP microchimerism may be a marker reflecting healthy maternal adaptation to pregnancy."
https://openalex.org/W2110791863,"A general description of effects of toxic compounds in mammalian cells is facing several problems. Firstly, most toxic compounds are hydrophobic and partition phenomena strongly influence their behaviour. Secondly, cells display considerable heterogeneity regarding the presence, activity and distribution of enzymes participating in the metabolism of foreign compounds i.e. bioactivation/biotransformation. Thirdly, cellular architecture varies greatly. Taken together, complexity at several levels has to be addressed to arrive at efficient in silico modelling based on physicochemical properties, metabolic preferences and cell characteristics. In order to understand the cellular behaviour of toxic foreign compounds we have developed a mathematical model that addresses these issues. In order to make the system numerically treatable, methods motivated by homogenization techniques have been applied. These tools reduce the complexity of mathematical models of cell dynamics considerably thus allowing to solve efficiently the partial differential equations in the model numerically on a personal computer. Compared to a compartment model with well-stirred compartments, our model affords a more realistic representation. Numerical results concerning metabolism and chemical solvolysis of a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon carcinogen show good agreement with results from measurements in V79 cell culture. The model can easily be extended and refined to include more reactants, and/or more complex reaction chains, enzyme distribution etc, and is therefore suitable for modelling cellular metabolism involving membrane partitioning also at higher levels of complexity."
https://openalex.org/W2083244640,"Vacuoles of yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae are functionally analogous to mammalian lysosomes. Both are cellular organelles responsible for macromolecular degradation, ion/pH homeostasis, and stress survival. We hypothesized that undefined gene functions remain at post-endosomal stage of vacuolar events and performed a genome-wide screen directed at such functions at the late endosome and vacuole interface – ENV genes. The immunodetection screen was designed to identify mutants that internally accumulate precursor form of the vacuolar hydrolase carboxypeptidase Y (CPY). Here, we report the uncovering and initial characterizations of twelve ENV genes. The small size of the collection and the lack of genes previously identified with vacuolar events are suggestive of the intended exclusive functional interface of the screen. Most notably, the collection includes four novel genes ENV7, ENV9, ENV10, and ENV11, and three genes previously linked to mitochondrial processes – MAM3, PCP1, PPE1. In all env mutants, vesicular trafficking stages were undisturbed in live cells as assessed by invertase and active α-factor secretion, as well as by localization of the endocytic fluorescent marker FM4-64 to the vacuole. Several mutants exhibit defects in stress survival functions associated with vacuoles. Confocal fluorescence microscopy revealed the collection to be significantly enriched in vacuolar morphologies suggestive of fusion and fission defects. These include the unique phenotype of lumenal vesicles within vacuoles in the novel env9Δ mutant and severely fragmented vacuoles upon deletion of GET4, a gene recently implicated in tail anchored membrane protein insertion. Thus, our results establish new gene functions in vacuolar function and morphology, and suggest a link between vacuolar and mitochondrial events."

The in vitro cytotoxic activity of each compound was tested on six human cancer cell lines (HepG2, Hep3B, Ca9-22, A549, MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231). In the case of 1′-O-alkyl-protoapigenone derivatives, structure-activity relationships were found depending on the side-chain, and protoapigenone 1′-O-butyl ether was found to exert significantly stronger activity against three of the cell lines (Hep3B, MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231) than its non-substituted analog, protoapigenone itself.

https://openalex.org/W1990210498,"HLA-C is an important ligand for killer immunoglobulin like receptors (KIR) that regulate natural killer (NK) cell function. Based on KIR specificity HLA-C molecules are allocated into two groups, HLA-C1 or HLA-C2; HLA-C2 is more inhibiting to NK cell function than HLA-C1. We studied the clinical importance of HLA-C genotypes on the long-term graft survival of 760 kidney transplants performed at our centre utilising a population based genetic study and cell culture model to define putative mechanisms.Genotyping was performed using conventional DNA PCR techniques and correlations made to clinical outcomes. We found that transplant recipients with HLA-C2 had significantly better long-term graft survival than transplant recipients with HLA-C1 (66% versus 44% at 10 years, log-rank p = 0.002, HR = 1.51, 95%CI = 1.16-1.97). In in-vitro NK and dendritic cell (DC) co-culture model we made several key observations that correlated with the population based genetic study. We observed that donor derived NK cells, on activation with IL-15, promoted differential HLA-C genotype dependent DC maturation. In NK-DC co-culture, the possession of HLA-C2 by DC was associated with anti-inflammatory cytokine production (IL-1RA/IL-6), diminished DC maturation (CD86, HLA-DR), and absent CCR7 expression. Conversely, possession of HLA-C1 by DC was associated with pro-inflammatory cytokine synthesis (TNF-α, IL-12p40/p70), enhanced DC maturation and up-regulation of CCR7 expression. By immunohistochemistry the presence of donor NK cells was confirmed in pre-transplant kidneys.We propose that after kidney transplantation IL-15 activated donor derived NK cells interact with recipient DC with less activation of indirect allo-reactivity in HLA-C2 positive recipients than HLA-C1 positive recipients; this has implications for long-term graft survival. Early events following kidney transplantation involving NK-DC interaction via KIR and HLA-C immune synapse may have a central role in long-term kidney transplant outcomes."
https://openalex.org/W2012502734,"Background Breast cancer is a polygenetic disorder with a complex inheritance pattern. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), the most common genetic variations, influence not only phenotypic traits, but also interindividual predisposition to disease, treatment outcomes with drugs and disease prognosis. The co-stimulatory molecule CD40 plays a prominent role in immune regulation and homeostasis. Accumulating evidence suggests that CD40 contributes to the pathogenesis of cancer. Here, we set out to test the association between polymorphisms in the CD40 gene and breast carcinogenesis and tumor pathology. Methodology and Principal Findings Four SNPs (rs1800686, rs1883832, rs4810485 and rs3765459) were genotyped by the polymerase chain reaction restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) method in a case-control study including 591 breast cancer patients and 600 age-matched healthy controls. Differences in the genotypic distribution between breast cancer patients and healthy controls were analyzed by the Chi-square test for trends. Our preliminary data showed a statistically significant association between the four CD40 gene SNPs and sporadic breast cancer risk (additive P = 0.0223, 0.0012, 0.0013 and 0.0279, respectively). A strong association was also found using the dominant, recessive and homozygote comparison genetic models. In the clinical features analysis, significant associations were observed between CD40 SNPs and lymph node metastasis, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (C-erbB2), estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR) and tumor protein 53 (P53) statuses. In addition, our haplotype analysis indicated that the haplotype Crs1883832Grs4810485, which was located within the only linkage disequilibrium (LD) block identified, was a protective haplotype for breast cancer, whereas Trs1883832Trs4810485 increased the risk in the studied population, even after correcting the P value for multiple testing (P = 0.0337 and 0.0430, respectively). Conclusions and Significance Our findings primarily show that CD40 gene polymorphisms contribute to sporadic breast cancer risk and have a significant association with clinicopathological features among Chinese Han women from the Heilongjiang Province."
https://openalex.org/W1989217826,"Given the expanding availability of scientific data and tools to analyze them, combining different assessments of the same piece of information has become increasingly important for social, biological, and even physical sciences. This task demands, to begin with, a method-independent standard, such as the -value, that can be used to assess the reliability of a piece of information. Good's formula and Fisher's method combine independent -values with respectively unequal and equal weights. Both approaches may be regarded as limiting instances of a general case of combining -values from groups; -values within each group are weighted equally, while weight varies by group. When some of the weights become nearly degenerate, as cautioned by Good, numeric instability occurs in computation of the combined -values. We deal explicitly with this difficulty by deriving a controlled expansion, in powers of differences in inverse weights, that provides both accurate statistics and stable numerics. We illustrate the utility of this systematic approach with a few examples. In addition, we also provide here an alternative derivation for the probability distribution function of the general case and show how the analytic formula obtained reduces to both Good's and Fisher's methods as special cases. A C++ program, which computes the combined -values with equal numerical stability regardless of whether weights are (nearly) degenerate or not, is available for download at our group website http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/CBBresearch/Yu/downloads/CoinedPValues.html."
https://openalex.org/W1989234645,"Introduction In vivo, most neurons in the main olfactory bulb exhibit robust spontaneous activity. This paper tests the hypothesis that spontaneous activity in olfactory receptor neurons drives much of the spontaneous activity in mitral and tufted cells via excitatory synapses. Methods Single units were recorded in vivo from the main olfactory bulb of a rat before, during, and after application of lidocaine to the olfactory nerve. The effect of lidocaine on the conduction of action potentials from the olfactory epithelium to the olfactory bulb was assessed by electrically stimulating the olfactory nerve rostral to the application site and monitoring the field potential evoked in the bulb. Results Lidocaine caused a significant decrease in the amplitude of the olfactory nerve evoked field potential that was recorded in the olfactory bulb. By contrast, the lidocaine block did not significantly alter the spontaneous activity of single units in the bulb, nor did it alter the field potential evoked by electrical stimulation of the lateral olfactory tract. Lidocaine block also did not change the temporal patters of action potential or their synchronization with respiration. Conclusions Spontaneous activity in neurons of the main olfactory bulb is not driven mainly by activity in olfactory receptor neurons despite the extensive convergence onto mitral and tufted cells. These results suggest that spontaneous activity of mitral and tufted is either an inherent property of these cells or is driven by centrifugal inputs to the bulb."
https://openalex.org/W2019001893,"Malaria greatly impacts the health and wellbeing of over half of the world's population. Promising malaria vaccine candidates have attempted to induce adaptive immune responses to Circumsporozoite (CS) protein. Despite the inclusion of potent adjuvants, these vaccines have limited protective efficacy. Conventional recombinant adenovirus (rAd) based vaccines expressing CS protein can induce CS protein specific immune responses, but these are essentially equivalent to those generated after use of the CS protein subunit based vaccines. In this study we combined the use of rAds expressing CS protein along with rAds expressing novel innate immune response modulating proteins in an attempt to significantly improve the induction of CS protein specific cell mediated immune (CMI) responses.BALB/cJ mice were co-vaccinated with a rAd vectors expressing CS protein simultaneous with a rAd expressing either TLR agonist (rEA) or SLAM receptors adaptor protein (EAT-2). Paradoxically, expression of the TLR agonist uncovered a potent immunosuppressive activity inherent to the combined expression of the CS protein and rEA. Fortunately, use of the rAd vaccine expressing EAT-2 circumvented CS protein's suppressive activity, and generated a fivefold increase in the number of CS protein responsive, IFNγ secreting splenocytes, as well as increased the breadth of T cells responsive to peptides present in the CS protein. These improvements were positively correlated with the induction of a fourfold improvement in CS protein specific CTL functional activity in vivo.Our results emphasize the need for caution when incorporating CS protein into malaria vaccine platforms expressing or containing other immunostimulatory compounds, as the immunological outcomes may be unanticipated and/or counter-productive. However, expressing the SLAM receptors derived signaling adaptor EAT-2 at the same time of vaccination with CS protein can overcome these concerns, as well as significantly improve the induction of malaria antigen specific adaptive immune responses in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W2025718072,"Background Plasmodium infection increases the oxidative stress inside the mosquito, leading to a significant alteration on transcription of Anopheles gambiae detoxification genes. Among these detoxification genes several P450 cytochromes and tubulins were differently expressed, suggesting their involvement in the mosquito's response to parasite invasion. P450 cytochromes are usually involved in the metabolism and detoxification of several compounds, but are also regulated by several pathogens, including malaria parasite. Tubulins are extremely important as components of the cytoskeleton, which rearrangement functions as a response to malaria parasite invasion. Methodology/Principal Findings Gene silencing methods were used to uncover the effects of cytochrome P450 reductase, tubulinA and tubulinB silencing on the A. gambiae response to Plasmodium berghei invasion. The role of tubulins in counter infection processes was also investigated by inhibiting their effect. Colchicine, vinblastine and paclitaxel, three different tubulin inhibitors were injected into A. gambiae mosquitoes. Twenty-four hours post injection these mosquitoes were infected with P. berghei through a blood meal from infected CD1 mice. Cytochrome P450 gene expression was measured using RT-qPCR to detect differences in cytochrome expression between silenced, inhibited and control mosquitoes. Results showed that cytochrome P450 reductase silencing, as well as tubulin (A and B) silencing and inhibition affected the efficiency of Plasmodium infection. Silencing and inhibition also affected the expression levels of cytochromes P450. Conclusions Our results suggest the existence of a relationship between tubulins and P450 cytochromes during A. gambiae immune response to P. berghei invasion. One of the P450 cytochromes in this study, CYP6Z2, stands out as the potential link in this association. Further work is needed to fully understand the role of tubulin genes in the response to Plasmodium infection."
https://openalex.org/W2165885688,"As a major component of the innate immune system, natural killer cells are responsible for activating the cytolytic killing of certain pathogen-infected or tumor cells. The self-recognition of natural killer cells is achieved in part by the killer cell immunoglobulin-like receptors (KIRs) protein family. In the current study, using a suite of biophysical methods, we investigate the self-association of an activating KIR, KIR2DS1. This KIR is of particular interest because when in the presence of the HLA-Cw6 protein, KIR2DS1 becomes a major risk factor for psoriasis, an autoimmune chronic skin disease. Using circular dichroism spectroscopy, dynamic light scattering, and atomic force microscopy, we reveal that KIR2DS1 self-associates in a well-defined fashion. Our novel results on an activating KIR allow us to suggest a working model for the KIR2DS1- HLA class I molecular mechanism."
https://openalex.org/W1981723729,"Background Severe malaria is difficult to differentiate from other forms of malaria or other infections with similar symptoms. Any parameter associated to malaria-attributable severe disease could help to improve severe malaria diagnosis. Methodology This study assessed the relation between erythropoietin (EPO) and malaria-attributable severe disease in an area of Mozambique with moderate malaria transmission. 211 children <5 years, recruited at Manhiça District Hospital or in the surrounding villages, were included in one of the following groups: severe malaria (SM, n = 44), hospital malaria without severity (HM, n = 49), uncomplicated malaria (UM, n = 47), invasive bacterial infection without malaria parasites (IBI, n = 39) and healthy community controls (C, n = 32). Malaria was diagnosed by microscopy and IBI by blood/cerebrospinal fluid culture. Principal Findings Mean EPO concentration in the control group was 20.95 U/l (SD = 2.96 U/l). Values in this group were lower when compared to each of the clinical groups (p = 0.026 C versus UM, p<0.001 C vs HM, p<0.001 C vs SM and p<0.001 C vs IBI). In the 3 malaria groups, values increased with severity [mean = 40.82 U/l (SD = 4.07 U/l), 125.91 U/l (SD = 4.99U/l) and 320.87 U/l (SD = 5.91U/l) for UM, HM and SM, respectively, p<0.001]. The IBI group [mean = 101.75 U/l (SD = 4.12 U/l)] presented lower values than the SM one (p = 0.002). In spite of the differences, values overlapped between study groups and EPO levels were only associated to hemoglobin. Hemoglobin means of the clinical groups were 93.98 g/dl (SD = 14.77 g/dl) for UM, 75.96 g/dl (SD = 16.48 g/dl) for HM, 64.34 g/dl (SD = 22.99 g/dl) for SM and 75.67 g/dl (SD = 16.58 g/dl) for IBI. Conclusions Although EPO levels increase according to malaria severity and are higher in severe malaria than in bacteremia, the utility of EPO to distinguish malaria-attributable severe disease is limited due to the overlap of values between the study groups and the main role of hemoglobin in the expression of EPO."
https://openalex.org/W2076146472,"The production of large progeny numbers affected by high mutation rates is a ubiquitous strategy of viruses, as it promotes quick adaptation and survival to changing environments. However, this situation often ushers in an arms race between the virus and the host cells. In this paper we investigate in depth a model for the dynamics of a phenotypically heterogeneous population of viruses whose propagation is limited to two-dimensional geometries, and where host cells are able to develop defenses against infection. Our analytical and numerical analyses are developed in close connection to directed percolation models. In fact, we show that making the space explicit in the model, which in turn amounts to reducing viral mobility and hindering the infective ability of the virus, connects our work with similar dynamical models that lie in the universality class of directed percolation. In addition, we use the fact that our model is a multicomponent generalization of the Domany-Kinzel probabilistic cellular automaton to employ several techniques developed in the past in that context, such as the two-site approximation to the extinction transition line. Our aim is to better understand propagation of viral infections with mobility restrictions, e.g., in crops or in plant leaves, in order to inspire new strategies for effective viral control."
https://openalex.org/W2070893570,"Complex diseases such as obesity and type II diabetes can result from a failure in multiple organ systems including the central nervous system and tissues involved in partitioning and disposal of nutrients. Studying the genetics of gene expression in tissues that are involved in the development of these diseases can provide insights into how these tissues interact within the context of disease. Expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) studies identify mRNA expression changes linked to proximal genetic signals (cis eQTLs) that have been shown to affect disease. Given the high impact of recent eQTL studies, it is important to understand what role sample size and environment plays in identification of cis eQTLs. Here we show in a genotyped obese human population that the number of cis eQTLs obey precise scaling laws as a function of sample size in three profiled tissues, i.e. omental adipose, subcutaneous adipose and liver. Also, we show that genes (or transcripts) with cis eQTL associations detected in a small population are detected at approximately 90% rate in the largest population available for our study, indicating that genes with strong cis acting regulatory elements can be identified with relatively high confidence in smaller populations. However, by increasing the sample size we allow for better detection of weaker and more distantly located cis-regulatory elements. Yet, we determined that the number of tissue specific cis eQTLs saturates in a modestly sized cohort while the number of cis eQTLs common to all tissues fails to reach a maximum value. Understanding the power laws that govern the number and specificity of eQTLs detected in different tissues, will allow a better utilization of genetics of gene expression to inform the molecular mechanism underlying complex disease traits."
https://openalex.org/W2170418185,"Background Papaver rhoeas possesses a gametophytic self-incompatibility (SI) system not homologous to any other SI mechanism characterized at the molecular level. Four previously published full length stigmatic S-alleles from the genus Papaver exhibited remarkable sequence divergence, but these studies failed to amplify additional S-alleles despite crossing evidence for more than 60 S-alleles in Papaver rhoeas alone. Methodology/Principal Findings Using RT-PCR we identified 87 unique putative stigmatic S-allele sequences from the Papaveraceae Argemone munita, Papaver mcconnellii, P. nudicuale, Platystemon californicus and Romneya coulteri. Hand pollinations among two full-sib families of both A. munita and P. californicus indicate a strong correlation between the putative S-genotype and observed incompatibility phenotype. However, we also found more than two S-like sequences in some individuals of A. munita and P. californicus, with two products co-segregating in both full-sib families of P. californicus. Pairwise sequence divergence estimates within and among taxa show Papaver stigmatic S-alleles to be the most variable with lower divergence among putative S-alleles from other Papaveraceae. Genealogical analysis indicates little shared ancestral polymorphism among S-like sequences from different genera. Lack of shared ancestral polymorphism could be due to long divergence times among genera studied, reduced levels of balancing selection if some or all S-like sequences do not function in incompatibility, population bottlenecks, or different levels of recombination among taxa. Preliminary estimates of positive selection find many sites under selective constraint with a few undergoing positive selection, suggesting that self-recognition may depend on amino acid substitutions at only a few sites. Conclusions/Significance Because of the strong correlation between genotype and SI phenotype, sequences reported here represent either functional stylar S-alleles, tightly linked paralogs of the S-locus or a combination of both. The considerable complexity revealed in this study shows we have much to learn about the evolutionary dynamics of self-incompatibility systems."
https://openalex.org/W2083668939,"Human topoisomerase I (Top1) relaxes supercoiled DNA during cell division. Camptothecin stabilizes Top1/dsDNA covalent complexes which ultimately results in cell death, and this makes Top1 an anti-cancer target. There are two current models for how camptothecin and derivatives bind to Top1/dsDNA covalent complexes (Staker, et al., 2002, Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 99: 15387–15392; and Laco, et al., 2004, Bioorg Med Chem 12: 5225–5235). The interaction energies between bound camptothecin, and derivatives, and Top1/dsDNA in the two models were calculated. The published structure-activity-relationships for camptothecin and derivatives correlated with the interaction energies for camptothecin and derivatives in the Laco et al. model, however, this was not the case for several camptothecin derivatives in the Stacker et al. model. By defining the binding orientation of camptothecin and derivatives in the Top1/dsDNA active-site these results allow for the rational design of potentially more efficacious camptothecin derivatives."
https://openalex.org/W2084557596,"The discrimination of thatcherized faces from typical faces was explored in two simultaneous alternative forced choice tasks. Reaction times (RTs) and errors were measured in a behavioural task. Brain activation was measured in an equivalent fMRI task. In both tasks, participants were tested with upright and inverted faces. Participants were also tested on churches in the behavioural task. The behavioural task confirmed the face specificity of the illusion (by comparing inversion effects for faces against churches) but also demonstrated that the discrimination was primarily, although not exclusively, driven by attending to eyes. The fMRI task showed that, relative to inverted faces, upright grotesque faces are discriminated via activation of a network of emotion/social evaluation processing areas. On the other hand, discrimination of inverted thatcherized faces was associated with increased activation of brain areas that are typically involved in perceptual processing of faces."

During Drosophila melanogaster spermatogenesis, 64 interconnected spermatids descended from a single germline stem cell are resolved into motile sperm in a process termed individualization. Here we identify a putative double-stranded RNA binding protein LUMP that is required for male fertility. lump1 mutants are male-sterile and lack motile sperm due to defects in sperm individualization. We show that one dsRNA binding domains (dsRBD) is essential for LUMP function in male fertility. These findings reveal LUMP is a novel factor required for late stages of male germline differentiation."
https://openalex.org/W2052885147,"Background Ribosomal RNAs have been widely used for identification and classification of species, and have produced data giving new insights into phylogenetic relationships. Recently, multilocus genotyping and even whole genome sequencing-based technologies have been adopted in ambitious comparative biology studies. However, such technologies are still far from routine-use in species classification studies due to their high costs in terms of labor, equipment and consumables. Methodology/Principal Findings Here, we describe a simple and powerful approach for species classification called genome profiling (GP). The GP method composed of random PCR, temperature gradient gel electrophoresis (TGGE) and computer-aided gel image processing is highly informative and less laborious. For demonstration, we classified 26 species of insects using GP and 18S rDNA-sequencing approaches. The GP method was found to give a better correspondence to the classical phenotype-based approach than did 18S rDNA sequencing employing a congruence value. To our surprise, use of a single probe in GP was sufficient to identify the relationships between the insect species, making this approach more straightforward. Conclusion/Significance The data gathered here, together with those of previous studies show that GP is a simple and powerful method that can be applied for actually universally identifying and classifying species. The current success supported our previous proposal that GP-based web database can be constructible and effective for the global identification/classification of species."
https://openalex.org/W1971208922,"Epigenetic factor CTCF (CCCTC binding factor) plays important roles in genetic controls of the cell fate. Previous studies found in corneal epithelial cells that CTCF is regulated by epidermal growth factor (EGF) through activation of NF-κB p65/p50. It also found that CTCF is suppressed in ultraviolet (UV) stress-induced corneal epithelial cells. However, it is still unknown how UV stress down-regulates CTCF affecting the cell fate. In the present study, we report that regulation of CTCF by extracellular stress signals is dependent upon activations of an oxidative stress-regulated protein Bcl-3. We found that activated Bcl-3 was able to bind to the κB sites identified in the CTCF promoter region. Bcl-3 was activated by UV irradiation to interact with NF-κB p50 by forming a Bcl-3/p50 heterodimer complex. The Bcl-3/p50 complex suppressed CTCF promoter activity to down-regulate CTCF transcription. Unlike the effect of EGF, UV stress-induced Bcl-3 activation suppressed CTCF activity without involving the IκBα and p65 pathway. Thus, results of the study reveal a novel mechanism for regulatory control of CTCF in UV stress-induced human corneal epithelial cells, which requires activation and formation of Bcl-3/p50 complex through a noncanonical NF-κB pathway."
