Studies of the bone marrow stroma have defined individual populations in the stem cell niche regulating hematopoietic regeneration and capable of initiating leukemia. Here, we use single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) to define a cellular taxonomy of the mouse bone marrow stroma and its perturbation by malignancy. We identified seventeen stromal subsets expressing distinct hematopoietic regulatory genes spanning new fibroblastic and osteoblastic subpopulations including distinct osteoblast differentiation trajectories. Emerging acute myeloid leukemia impaired mesenchymal osteogenic differentiation and reduced regulatory molecules necessary for normal hematopoiesis. These data suggest that tissue stroma responds to malignant cells by disadvantaging normal parenchymal cells. Our taxonomy of the stromal compartment provides a comprehensive bone marrow cell census and experimental support for cancer cell crosstalk with specific stromal elements to impair normal tissue function and thereby enable emergent cancer.

Stem cell niches are a tissue microenvironment that maintains and regulates stem cell function through cellular interactions and secreted factors (Schofield, 1978Schofield R.

Hematopoiesis provides a paradigm for understanding mammalian stem cell niches with pivotal knowledge from numerous in vivo studies on the critical role of specific non-hematopoietic, stromal cells in regulating hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) function (Calvi et al., 2003Calvi L.M.

One major component is multipotent mesenchymal stem/stromal cells (MSCs), non-hematopoietic cells derived from the mesoderm with potential to differentiate into bone, fat, and cartilage in vitro (Kfoury and Scadden, 2015Kfoury Y. Scadden D.T. Mesenchymal cell contributions to the stem cell niche.Cell Stem Cell. 2015; 16: 239-253Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). While MSCs are found in most tissues, their diversity and lineage relationships are incompletely understood. For instance, several subtypes of MSCs that regulate HSCs have been described in specialized bone niches. Most of them are located in the perivascular space and are associated with arteriole or sinusoidal blood vessels, and produce key HSC niche factors such as Cxcl12 and stem cell factor (SCF, also named Kitl) (Morrison and Scadden, 2014Morrison S.J. Scadden D.T. The bone marrow niche for haematopoietic stem cells.Nature. 2014; 505: 327-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (857) Google Scholar). They are identified by expression of leptin receptor (Lepr) (Ding and Morrison, 2013Ding L. Morrison S.J.

However, the Lepr-cre (Zhou et al., 2014aZhou B.O. Yue R. Murphy M.M. Peyer J.G. Morrison S.J. Leptin-receptor-expressing mesenchymal stromal cells represent the main source of bone formed by adult bone marrow.Cell Stem Cell. 2014; 15: 154-168Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar) and Nes-GFP (Méndez-Ferrer et al., 2010Méndez-Ferrer S.

Therefore, it is unclear if these markers delineate distinct or overlapping cell populations. Other non-hematopoietic cells, including bone marrow-derived endothelial cells (BMECs) and MSC-descendent osteolineage cells (OLCs), also function as niche cells. BMECs produce Cxcl12 and Kitl and are critical regulators of HSC function (Butler et al., 2010Butler J.M. Nolan D.J. Vertes E.L. Varnum-Finney B. Kobayashi H. Hooper A.T. Seandel M. Shido K.

Despite extensive studies, a comprehensive analysis of bone marrow stromal cells is missing, limiting our ability to prospectively isolate and functionally characterize niche cells. Previous profiling studies used reporter genes to purify bulk cell populations (Morrison and Scadden, 2014Morrison S.J. Scadden D.T. The bone marrow niche for haematopoietic stem cells.Nature. 2014; 505: 327-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (857) Google Scholar), which necessarily underestimate cell complexity and restrict analysis in a marker-biased manner. Here, we use single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) to chart a comprehensive census of the bone marrow stroma. We identified 17 distinct cell subsets and their gene signatures, and defined stromal cells expressing key niche factors at steady-state hematopoiesis. We further inferred their differentiation relationships and characterized diversity within specific cell types. Finally, we dissected the global influence of developing acute myeloid leukemia (AML) on the bone marrow microenvironment and described resulting cellular and molecular abnormalities. To explore the cellular composition of the mouse bone marrow stroma, we profiled non-hematopoietic bone marrow cells from C57BL/6 mice (n = 14) by droplet-based scRNA-seq (Figures 1A, 1B, and S1A–S1E). Unbiased clustering of the stroma resulted in 17 clusters originating from bone or bone marrow (Figure 1B, inset; Table S1), spanning MSCs, OLCs, chondrocytes, fibroblasts, BMECs, and pericytes and possible transitional states (Figures 1B–1H and S1F–S1H). In particular, there were: (1) MSCs (cluster 1, expressing Lepr) (Ding and Morrison, 2013Ding L. Morrison S.J. Haematopoietic stem cells and early lymphoid progenitors occupy distinct bone marrow niches.Nature. 2013; 495: 231-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (509) Google Scholar) and Cxcl12 (Greenbaum et al., 2013Greenbaum A.

Cluster 6 and 11 were separated from cluster 0 through Lin-/Er-/CD31+/Sca1+/CD34+/VE-Cadherin+. To help resolve differentiation relations among cells we used correlations of average expression profiles between clusters (Figure 1F), graph abstraction (Wolf et al., 2017Wolf F.A. Hamey F. Plass M.

Graph abstraction reconciles clustering with trajectory inference through a topology preserving map of single cells.bioRxiv. 2017; https://doi.org/10.1101/208819Crossref Google Scholar) (Figure 1G), and diffusion map analysis (Schiebinger et al., 2017Schiebinger G.

We discuss these below in the context of each lineage and differentiation path. We validated two of the most abundant subsets, MSCs and BMECs, by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS), showing that the four clusters can be partitioned prospectively by using antibodies that label BMECs (CD31, Sca-1(Ly6a), CD34, Cdh5) or MSCs (CD106) (Figures S1G, S1K, and S1L). The prevailing model of MSCs in the bone marrow is that of a multipotent stem cell that can differentiate into bone cells, adipocytes, and chondrocytes (Dominici et al., 2006Dominici M. Le Blanc K.

The cells expressed MSC markers (Nt5e, Vcam1, and Eng) as well as Grem1, a marker of mouse skeletal stem cells (Worthley et al., 2015Worthley D.L. Churchill M. Compton J.T. Tailor Y. Rao M. Si Y.

Other previously proposed MSC markers, such as Thy1, Ly6a, and the perivascular MSC markers Nes and NG2 (Cspg4), were not expressed in cluster 1, but were expressed in other clusters. This indicated the potential for MSC activity in other clusters (Figures S2A–S2C). Our designation of mesenchymal stromal cells does not preclude the functional attributes of mesenchymal stem cells in other stromal populations. Our taxonomy was based on gene expression with annotations of putative functions; current methods do not allow in vivo functional assessment of each cell cluster.Figure S2Four Subsets of HSC Regulator-Producing Lepr-MSCs Form a Differentiation Continuum, Related to Figure 2Show full caption(A,B) tSNE of Figure 1B colored by expression (color bar, TP10K) of select genes used in the field for labeling MSC populations.

Although these findings have reignited debate in the field, they starkly contrast with other recently published data demonstrating that adult hippocampal neurogenesis is sustained through aging in the human brain, albeit at lower levels than in the young human brain (Boldrini et al., 2018Boldrini M.

Moreover, a recent study demonstrates the existence of neurogenesis in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) (Moreno-Jiménez et al., 2019Moreno-Jiménez E.P. Flor-García M. Terreros-Roncal J. Rábano A. Cafini F.

With that said, using similar proxy markers as several recent studies (Boldrini et al., 2018Boldrini M. Fulmore C.A. Tartt A.N. Simeon L.R. Pavlova I. Poposka V. Rosoklija G.B. Stankov A. Arango V.

Auguste K.I. et al.Human hippocampal neurogenesis drops sharply in children to undetectable levels in adults.Nature. 2018; 555: 377-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (795) Google Scholar), we demonstrate that adult hippocampal neurogenesis is present from the eighth to the tenth decade of life and that it is detectable even in persons with mild cognitive impairments (MCIs) and AD. Moreover, we observed a decline in the number of DCX+PCNA+ neuroblasts in people with MCI and show that higher numbers of these neuroblasts correlate with improved global cognitive scores and an overall better clinical diagnosis. Finally, we show association between the numbers of cells within different neurogenic subpopulations and levels of presynaptic markers. Specifically, we observed positive correlation between the number of DCX+PCNA+ and the level of interaction between the SNAP Receptor (SNARE) proteins syntaxin and SNAP-25. Disrupted levels of these proteins are associated with cortical atrophy and dementia (Ramos-Miguel et al., 2017Ramos-Miguel A. Sawada K. Jones A.A. Thornton A.E. Barr A.M. Leurgans S.E. Schneider J.A. Bennett D.A. Honer W.G. Presynaptic proteins complexin-I and complexin-II differentially influence cognitive function in early and late stages of Alzheimer’s disease.Acta Neuropathol. 2017; 133: 395-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), and greater levels are associated with cognitive reserve (Honer et al., 2012Honer W.G. Barr A.M. Sawada K. Thornton A.E. Morris M.C. Leurgans S.E. Schneider J.A. Bennett D.A. Cognitive reserve, presynaptic proteins and dementia in the elderly.Transl. Psychiatry. 2012; 2: e114Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Taken together, our study provides evidence that the extent of neurogenesis is associated with cognitive status and that a decline in neurogenesis may be an early event in AD. In these studies, we examined hippocampi from 18 individuals between the ages of 79 and 99 years (Table S1) for the presence of neural progenitor cells (NPCs), proliferating NPCs, neuroblasts, or immature neurons. Each cell count was normalized in cubic millimeters, and the volume-normalized cell counts were upweighted to total dentate gyrus (DG) volumes obtained from postmortem ex vivo MRI to estimate the total numbers of these cell types present in the entire DG. Additionally, cell numbers were stratified into counts in the granule cell layer (GCL) and subgranular layer (SGL) of the dentate gyrus. To examine the presence of NPCs, we quantified the number of cells that were immunopositive for several combinations of proxy markers of neurogenesis. We quantified the volume-normalized cell counts of these cell types in the SGL and GCL separately. We found that, in the SGL, these individuals had an average of 419.9 ± 119 Nestin+ cells/mm3 (Figure 1A) and 898.9 ± 216.6 PCNA+ cells/mm3 (Figure 1B). To determine the number of proliferating Nestin+ cells, we quantified the number of double-labeled Nestin+PCNA+ cells and observed that these individuals had an average of 11.2 ± 6.7 Nestin+PCNA+ cells/mm3 (Figure 1C). In the GCL, these subjects had an average number of 284.4 ± 85.55 Nestin+ cells/mm3 (Figure 1D), 1,096 ± 295.5 PCNA+ cells/mm3 (Figure 1E), and 3.5 ± 2.4 Nestin+PCNA+ cells/mm3 (Figure 1F). When upweighted to the volume of the entire DG, our data suggest a mean count of 55,460 ± 14,687 Nestin+ cells (Figure 1G), an average count of 163,564 ± 43,292 PCNA+ (Figure 1H), and an average count of 1,567 ± 669 Nestin+PCNA+ (Figure 1I). The 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for Nestin+ cells in the SGL, GCL, and total are (2,799, 14,023), (2,896, 11,747), and (8,335, 25,341), respectively (Table 1). The 95% CIs for PCNA+ cells in the SGL, GCL, and total are (8,845, 26,941), (18,541, 64,316), and (33,052, 96,006), respectively (Table 1). As these CIs do not include zero, we can say with 95% certainty that Nestin+ and PCNA+ cell types exist in the adult human dentate gyrus. Although single positive cells were detectable from all 18 subjects, double- and triple-positive cells were detectable from subsets of subjects. Out of 18 subjects, 33.3% of subjects (p = 6/18) showed positive Nestin+PCNA+ (95% CI for p: 0.12 and 0.97; Table 2). To better characterize these cells and improve our ability to ascertain whether these are NPCs, we quantified numbers of Nestin+Sox2+ double-positive cells (Figures 1J, 1M, and 1P). To determine whether a fraction of these NPCs proliferate, we quantified the number of Nestin+Sox2+Ki67+ triple-positive cells from the DG (Figures 1L, 1O, and 1Q). Ki67 was used to validate data obtained using PCNA, because Ki67 was previously reported to be more specific (Bologna-Molina et al., 2013Bologna-Molina R. Mosqueda-Taylor A. Molina-Frechero N. Mori-Estevez A.D. Sánchez-Acuña G. Comparison of the value of PCNA and Ki-67 as markers of cell proliferation in ameloblastic tumors.Med. Oral Patol. Oral Cir. Bucal. 2013; 18: e174-e179Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). 77.8% subjects (p = 14/18) showed the presence of Nestin+Sox2+ cells (95% CI for p: 0.7 and 1; Table 2), where the number of cells for positive subjects was 45.7 ± 10.3 cells/mm3 (Figure 1J). Almost all subjects (p = 17/18) showed positive Nestin+Ki67+, where the number of cells was 18.9 ± 2.9 cells/mm3 (Figure 1K). The 95% CIs for Nestin+Ki67+ cells in the DG are (859, 2,016) (Table 1). 50% subjects (p = 9/18) showed positive Nestin+Sox2+Ki67+ (95% CI for p: 0.26 and 1; Table 2), where the number of cells for positive subjects was 9.3 ± 1.3 cells/mm3 (Figure 1L). When upweighted to the volume of the entire DG for subjects with positive double-/triple-labeled cells, our data estimate a mean count as 2,473.7 ± 494.1 for Nestin+Sox2+ (Figure 1M), 1,437.8 ± 274.2 for Nestin+Ki67+ (Figure 1N), and 773.7 ± 108.9 for Nestin+Sox2+Ki67+ (Figure 1O). Of these 18 subjects, 10 (55.6%) had AD (Table S1). These results suggest that NPCs are present in the aging, MCI, and AD hippocampus. It should be noted that, in contrast to previous reports (Bologna-Molina et al., 2013Bologna-Molina R. Mosqueda-Taylor A. Molina-Frechero N. Mori-Estevez A.D. Sánchez-Acuña G. Comparison of the value of PCNA and Ki-67 as markers of cell proliferation in ameloblastic tumors.Med. Oral Patol. Oral Cir. Bucal. 2013; 18: e174-e179Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar), our comparison between Ki67+ and PCNA+ labeling in Nestin+ was inconclusive. Some brain sections had higher number of Nestin+PCNA+ compared to Nestin+Ki67+ and vice versa (Figure S1). Based on these data, one cannot conclude that one proxy exhibits greater specificity compared to the other. Rather, our data in postmortem human brain sections suggest that Ki67 and PCNA are complementary proxies of cell proliferation in NPCs. More studies are warranted in order to determine their expression pattern in adult neurogenesis.Table 1Mean Estimates and 95% Confidence Intervals for Cell Counts Upweighted to Regional Dentate Gyrus Volumes for All 18 Patients95% Confidence IntervalImmunolabeled CellsEstimateLower BoundUpper BoundSubgranular LayerNestin+8,4112,79914,023PCNA+17,8928,84526,941DCX+10,6534,21317,093Granular Cell LayerNestin+7,3212,89611,747PCNA+41,42918,54264,316DCX+30,38115,90044,861TotalNestin+16,8388,33525,341PCNA+64,52933,05296,006DCX+48,20825,06571,351Nestin+Ki67+1,4388592,016Estimated quantification of single (Nestin+, PCNA+, and DCX+) or double (Nestin+Ki67+) immunolabeled cells present in the SGL, GCL, and whole DG in brain sections of humans participating in this study.

We next sought to determine the presence of neuroblasts and immature neurons in these brains. We found that, in the SGL, these individuals had an average of 771.6 ± 181.1 DCX+ cells/mm3 (Figures 2A and 2G ). In the GCL, these subjects had an average number of 735.3 ± 180.9 DCX+ cells/mm3 (Figure 2B). When upweighted to the volume of the entire DG, our data suggest an average count of 127,342 ± 28,864 DCX+ cells (Figure 2C). The 95% CIs for DCX+ cells in the SGL, GCL, and total are (4,213, 17,093), (15,900, 44,861), and (25,065, 71,351), respectively (Table 1). As these CIs do not include zero, we can say with 95% certainty that DCX+ cells exist in the adult human dentate gyrus. To determine the number of proliferating neuroblasts, we quantified the number of DCX+PCNA+. The average number of DCX+PCNA+ in the SGL was 13.65 ± 6.81 (Figure 2D) and in the GCL 22.8 ± 8.7 (Figure 2E). 50% subjects (p = 9/18) showed positive DCX+PCNA+ (95% CI for p: 0.09 and 1; Table 2). Upweighted to the volume of the entire DG, our data estimate a mean count as 3,054 ± 1,149 for PCNA+DCX+ cells (Figure 2F). Collectively, this suggests that NPCs, neuroblasts, and immature neurons remain detectable even in aging persons with disorders affecting hippocampal function. One potential obstacle to studying post mortem brain tissue is the post mortem brain interval (PMI), with some previous studies demonstrating a deleterious effect of prolonged PMI on brain antigenicity (Boldrini et al., 2009Boldrini M. Underwood M.D. Hen R. Rosoklija G.B. Dwork A.J. John Mann J. Arango V.

Gould T.D. Yuan P. Manji H.K. Chen G. Post-mortem interval effects on the phosphorylation of signaling proteins.Neuropsychopharmacology. 2003; 28: 1017-1025Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Most of the tissue used in our study had a PMI ≤ 20 h. To investigate the effect of PMI on our cell counts, we performed Spearman’s rank-order correlation analysis between PMI and cell numbers. We observed an inverse correlation between the number of Nestin+, PCNA+, and DCX+ cells in the SGL, GCL, and PMI (Figures S2A, S2B, S2E, S2F, S2I, and S2J). However, these correlations only reach statistical significance for Nestin+ and PCNA+ cells specifically in the SGL (Figures S2B and S2F). It should be noted that we had only one case of PMI > 20 h; thus, further analysis is required in order to establish an association between PMI and number of cells in post mortem brain sections. These results may suggest that the PMI should be taken into consideration during tissue selection for this type of analysis. Due to known differences in the functional significance of the dorsal and ventral parts of the hippocampus (Bannerman et al., 2003Bannerman D.M. Grubb M. Deacon R.M. Yee B.K. Feldon J. Rawlins J.N.

An autoradiographic study of the organization of the efferent connections of the hippocampal formation in the rat.J. Comp.

To do this, linear mixed effects regression with subject-specific random slope and intercept was performed. The location in the hippocampus was measured as the distance posterior to the mammillary bodies (the anatomical landmark used to determine the anterior-most aspect of the hippocampus). It is noteworthy that the number of sections per subject determined by absolute distance as described above varies across subjects due to differences in individual hippocampal shape and volume. We additionally examined statistical meta-analysis that estimates each subject’s slope and then synthesized to draw inference across subjects. Results from linear mixed effects regression are presented to demonstrate any correlation between cell count and location within the hippocampus (Figure 3). We found that the number of Nestin+ cells in the SGL (Figure 3A; β = −0.265; p = 0.038), the number of Nestin+ cells in the GCL (Figure 3D; β = −0.325; p = 0.02), and the total number of Nestin+ cells (Figure 3G; β = −0.336; p = 0.015) had a significant negative association with the distance posterior to the mammillary bodies, meaning that the more posterior in the hippocampus (i.e., the dorsal aspects of the hippocampus), the fewer number of Nestin+ cells were present. There were no other significant associations detected for the other cell types or layers of the dentate gyrus (Figures 3B, 3C, 3E, 3F, and 3H–3N), suggesting that NPCs, neuroblasts, and immature neurons are evenly distributed along the dorsal-ventral axis. To start to address a possible association between the extent of neurogenesis and cognition, we tested the correlation between the number of neurogenic proxy and cognitive diagnosis. For this purpose, we performed logistic regression analysis. We show a significant association between the number of DCX+PCNA+ cells and cognitive diagnosis, where patients with MCI, compared to normal patients with no cognitive impairments, are associated with fewer numbers of DCX+PCNA+ cells (p = 0.038; Figure 4A). In addition, when combined into one group of cognitive impairments (MCI+AD), these patients show a trend toward fewer DCX+PCNA+ cells, but the association fails to reach statistical significance (p = 0.068; Figure 4B). These results suggest that, with higher numbers of DCX+PCNA+ cells, it is less likely that one would have MCI or AD. General linear model (GLM) analysis with global cognitive score and the number of DCX+PCNA+ cells shows significant association (p = 0.0461; Figure 4C), suggesting that higher numbers of DCX+PCNA+ cells correlate with higher cognitive scores. Interestingly, association between global cognitive scores and the number of Nestin+Sox2+Ki67+ cells is also suggested, albeit insignificant (p = 0.098; Figure 4D), where lower cognitive score is associated with higher numbers of Nestin+Sox2+Ki67+ cells. These analyses suggest a possible association between the extent of neurogenesis and cognitive status. In addition, it suggests that cognitive status may be associated with differential levels of distinct neurogenic subpopulations. Lastly, the number of DCX+PCNA+ cells may be indicative of early cognitive decline. Increasing evidence suggests that levels of synaptic proteins are associated with cognitive decline (Ramos-Miguel et al., 2017Ramos-Miguel A. Sawada K. Jones A.A. Thornton A.E. Barr A.M. Leurgans S.E. Schneider J.A. Bennett D.A. Honer W.G.

Frontotemporal dysregulation of the SNARE protein interactome is associated with faster cognitive decline in old age.Neurobiol. Dis. 2018; 114: 31-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Particularly, the ability of the SNARE proteins (i.e., syntaxin-1, SNAP25, and VAMP) to form complexes were found to be predictors of cognitive function (Ramos-Miguel et al., 2018Ramos-Miguel A. Jones A.A. Sawada K. Barr A.M. Bayer T.A. Falkai P. Leurgans S.E. Schneider J.A. Bennett D.A. Honer W.G. Frontotemporal dysregulation of the SNARE protein interactome is associated with faster cognitive decline in old age.Neurobiol. Dis. 2018; 114: 31-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Analysis of these presynaptic proteins suggests that the level of their functional interactions is associated with greater brain reserve, better cognition, and less decline over time (Honer et al., 2012Honer W.G. Barr A.M. Sawada K. Thornton A.E. Morris M.C. Leurgans S.E. Schneider J.A. Bennett D.A. Cognitive reserve, presynaptic proteins and dementia in the elderly.Transl.

Presynaptic proteins complexin-I and complexin-II differentially influence cognitive function in early and late stages of Alzheimer’s disease.Acta Neuropathol. 2017; 133: 395-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Thus, we next asked whether the number of neurogenic cell populations correlates with the level of functional interaction of these synaptic proteins in the brains of these individuals. We found that numbers of DCX+PCNA+ cells and a summary measure of the amount of SNARE protein-protein interactions (SNAP-25-syntaxin) measured from 6 regions (hippocampus, midfrontal cortex, inferior temporal, calcarine cortex, posterior putamen, and ventromedial caudate) were positively correlated (Figure 4E), supporting the preliminary observation of positive correlation between numbers of DCX+PCNA+ cells and cognition. SNAP-25 expression could be detected in the hippocampal neurogenic niche in these brain sections (Figure 4F). Taken together, these results suggest that there is an association between level of newly maturing neurons and the level of functional interactions of SNARE proteins. Similar to previously reported observations, relationships between neurogenesis, synaptic proteins, and cognition can be cell or region specific. Another factor that may affect the extent of neurogenesis, particularly in MCI and AD, is the pathological hallmarks of AD, i.e., amyloid deposition and neurofibrillary tangles or their precursors. Thus, we next asked whether there is an association between tau and amyloid pathology and levels of neurogenesis in these brains. To address that, we performed Spearman’s rank correlation analysis between neurogenesis and levels of amyloid deposition or neurofibrillary tangles, as previously described (Boyle et al., 2013Boyle P.A.

Aging Neurosci. 2013; 5: 50Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), and found no association (Figures S3, S4, and S5). This study offers several important insights. First, contrary to previous data (Sorrells et al., 2018Sorrells S.F. Paredes M.F. Cebrian-Silla A. Sandoval K. Qi D. Kelley K.W. James D. Mayer S. Chang J.

However, neuron-astrocyte coupling of lipid metabolism, particularly in response to neural activity, remains largely uncharacterized. Here, we demonstrate that toxic fatty acids (FAs) produced in hyperactive neurons are transferred to astrocytic lipid droplets by ApoE-positive lipid particles. Astrocytes consume the FAs stored in lipid droplets via mitochondrial β-oxidation in response to neuronal activity and turn on a detoxification gene expression program. Our findings reveal that FA metabolism is coupled in neurons and astrocytes to protect neurons from FA toxicity during periods of enhanced activity. This coordinated mechanism for metabolizing FAs could underlie both homeostasis and a variety of disease states of the brain."
https://openalex.org/W2945294912,"The mechanisms by which cells adapt to proteotoxic stress are largely unknown, but are key to understanding how tumor cells, particularly in vivo, are largely resistant to proteasome inhibitors. Analysis of cancer cell lines, mouse xenografts and patient-derived tumor samples all showed an association between mitochondrial metabolism and proteasome inhibitor sensitivity. When cells were forced to use oxidative phosphorylation rather than glycolysis, they became proteasome-inhibitor resistant. This mitochondrial state, however, creates a unique vulnerability: sensitivity to the small molecule compound elesclomol. Genome-wide CRISPR–Cas9 screening showed that a single gene, encoding the mitochondrial reductase FDX1, could rescue elesclomol-induced cell death. Enzymatic function and nuclear-magnetic-resonance-based analyses further showed that FDX1 is the direct target of elesclomol, which promotes a unique form of copper-dependent cell death. These studies explain a fundamental mechanism by which cells adapt to proteotoxic stress and suggest strategies to mitigate proteasome inhibitor resistance. Mitochondrial energy metabolism regulates proteotoxic stress tolerance, exposing a newly discovered sensitivity to the small molecule elesclomol, which induces FDX1-mediated, copper-dependent cell death."

Applying this framework to 1,790 autism spectrum disorder (ASD) simplex families reveals a role in disease for noncoding mutations—ASD probands harbor both transcriptional- and post-transcriptional-regulation-disrupting de novo mutations of significantly higher functional impact than those in unaffected siblings. Further analysis suggests involvement of noncoding mutations in synaptic transmission and neuronal development and, taken together with previous studies, reveals a convergent genetic landscape of coding and noncoding mutations in ASD. We demonstrate that sequences carrying prioritized mutations identified in probands possess allele-specific regulatory activity, and we highlight a link between noncoding mutations and heterogeneity in the IQ of ASD probands. Our predictive genomics framework illuminates the role of noncoding mutations in ASD and prioritizes mutations with high impact for further study, and is broadly applicable to complex human diseases. Application of a deep-learning-based framework shows that individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) harbor regulation-disrupting mutations of higher functional impact than those in unaffected siblings and identifies a convergent genetic landscape of coding and noncoding de novo mutations in ASD."
https://openalex.org/W2945711079,"How do genes modify cellular growth to create morphological diversity? We study this problem in two related plants with differently shaped leaves: Arabidopsis thaliana (simple leaf shape) and Cardamine hirsuta (complex shape with leaflets). We use live imaging, modeling, and genetics to deconstruct these organ-level differences into their cell-level constituents: growth amount, direction, and differentiation. We show that leaf shape depends on the interplay of two growth modes: a conserved organ-wide growth mode that reflects differentiation; and a local, directional mode that involves the patterning of growth foci along the leaf edge. Shape diversity results from the distinct effects of two homeobox genes on these growth modes: SHOOTMERISTEMLESS broadens organ-wide growth relative to edge-patterning, enabling leaflet emergence, while REDUCED COMPLEXITY inhibits growth locally around emerging leaflets, accentuating shape differences created by patterning. We demonstrate the predictivity of our findings by reconstructing key features of C. hirsuta leaf morphology in A. thaliana.Video AbstracteyJraWQiOiI4ZjUxYWNhY2IzYjhiNjNlNzFlYmIzYWFmYTU5NmZmYyIsImFsZyI6IlJTMjU2In0.eyJzdWIiOiI2N2FkZGM1NDg0NjUzNTg2MjFiNjlkMThhNjljNmJmMSIsImtpZCI6IjhmNTFhY2FjYjNiOGI2M2U3MWViYjNhYWZhNTk2ZmZjIiwiZXhwIjoxNjc5MjI3MjQ5fQ.Hcq4DSnoQETcLUQvQJmJjzEz1i9yzThgSqYF--n1bHlEwaQ1br6n3BfH4HB4lLo0uil4U864yEZDwr2Qerr11HboUSOPtzTzUm7CeDYFDcmx4J3buaaqFVaAlOyo0P6ERJKc85lAqDRzJDdoxrf6mF_nW5LiB57hIk3V1UyRjqrMX8lPLnDIGgV1Vo1MEJRfbI0SBa0ZbuIXyQZYHZFBfvTtaG5x5tcwpNuDcxfow7jwVJ39GcqsmzcLATuqcDHl7fFzg0_7Z39C2TFvLmoEz8-Aa2ff28-k3oPaIeaX-04HwRHkaB-RBlNvna2kDKU8D9QUnVUGpNwRfTqAUN6qmA(mp4, (98.74 MB) Download video"
https://openalex.org/W2946448736,"The deubiquitinating enzyme BAP1 is a tumor suppressor, among others involved in cholangiocarcinoma. BAP1 has many proposed molecular targets, while its Drosophila homolog is known to deubiquitinate histone H2AK119. We introduce BAP1 loss-of-function by CRISPR/Cas9 in normal human cholangiocyte organoids. We find that BAP1 controls the expression of junctional and cytoskeleton components by regulating chromatin accessibility. Consequently, we observe loss of multiple epithelial characteristics while motility increases. Importantly, restoring the catalytic activity of BAP1 in the nucleus rescues these cellular and molecular changes. We engineer human liver organoids to combine four common cholangiocarcinoma mutations (TP53, PTEN, SMAD4, and NF1). In this genetic background, BAP1 loss results in acquisition of malignant features upon xenotransplantation. Thus, control of epithelial identity through the regulation of chromatin accessibility appears to be a key aspect of BAP1’s tumor suppressor function. Organoid technology combined with CRISPR/Cas9 provides an experimental platform for mechanistic studies of cancer gene function in a human context."
https://openalex.org/W2945934042,"Down syndrome (DS) is a common neurodevelopmental disorder, and cognitive defects in DS patients may arise from imbalances in excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmission. Understanding the mechanisms underlying such imbalances may provide opportunities for therapeutic intervention. Here, we show that human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) derived from DS patients overproduce OLIG2+ ventral forebrain neural progenitors. As a result, DS hiPSC-derived cerebral organoids excessively produce specific subclasses of GABAergic interneurons and cause impaired recognition memory in neuronal chimeric mice. Increased OLIG2 expression in DS cells directly upregulates interneuron lineage-determining transcription factors. shRNA-mediated knockdown of OLIG2 largely reverses abnormal gene expression in early-stage DS neural progenitors, reduces interneuron production in DS organoids and chimeric mouse brains, and improves behavioral deficits in DS chimeric mice. Thus, altered OLIG2 expression may underlie neurodevelopmental abnormalities and cognitive defects in DS patients."

We identified the existence of more than 290 clinically associated genomic phylogroups across 22 countries, highlighting challenges in designing vaccines of global utility. To determine vaccine candidate coverage, we investigated all of the previously described GAS candidate antigens for gene carriage and gene sequence heterogeneity. Only 15 of 28 vaccine antigen candidates were found to have both low naturally occurring sequence variation and high (>99%) coverage across this diverse GAS population. This technological platform for vaccine coverage determination is equally applicable to prospective GAS vaccine antigens identified in future studies.

https://openalex.org/W2947039493,"A remarkable feature of motor control is the ability to coordinate movements across distinct body parts into a consistent, skilled action. To reach and grasp an object, 'gross' arm and 'fine' dexterous movements must be coordinated as a single action. How the nervous system achieves this coordination is currently unknown. One possibility is that, with training, gross and fine movements are co-optimized to produce a coordinated action; alternatively, gross and fine movements may be modularly refined to function together. To address this question, we recorded neural activity in the primary motor cortex and dorsolateral striatum during reach-to-grasp skill learning in rats. During learning, the refinement of fine and gross movements was behaviorally and neurally dissociable. Furthermore, inactivation of the primary motor cortex and dorsolateral striatum had distinct effects on skilled fine and gross movements. Our results indicate that skilled movement coordination is achieved through emergent modular neural control."
https://openalex.org/W2945767124,"The mouse X-inactivation center (Xic) locus represents a powerful model for understanding the links between genome architecture and gene regulation, with the non-coding genes Xist and Tsix showing opposite developmental expression patterns while being organized as an overlapping sense/antisense unit. The Xic is organized into two topologically associating domains (TADs) but the role of this architecture in orchestrating cis-regulatory information remains elusive. To explore this, we generated genomic inversions that swap the Xist/Tsix transcriptional unit and place their promoters in each other’s TAD. We found that this led to a switch in their expression dynamics: Xist became precociously and ectopically upregulated, both in male and female pluripotent cells, while Tsix expression aberrantly persisted during differentiation. The topological partitioning of the Xic is thus critical to ensure proper developmental timing of X inactivation. Our study illustrates how the genomic architecture of cis-regulatory landscapes can affect the regulation of mammalian developmental processes. Swapping the Xist/Tsix transcriptional units and placing their promoters in each other’s topologically associating domain shows that the topological partitioning of the X-inactivation center is critical to ensure proper X inactivation during development."

Here we describe two complementary screens for genetic and physical interactors of BRD4, which converge on the folate pathway enzyme MTHFD1 (methylenetetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase, cyclohydrolase and formyltetrahydrofolate synthetase 1). We show that a fraction of MTHFD1 resides in the nucleus, where it is recruited to distinct genomic loci by direct interaction with BRD4. Inhibition of either BRD4 or MTHFD1 results in similar changes in nuclear metabolite composition and gene expression; pharmacological inhibitors of the two pathways synergize to impair cancer cell viability in vitro and in vivo. Our finding that MTHFD1 and other metabolic enzymes are chromatin associated suggests a direct role for nuclear metabolism in the control of gene expression."

Recent work sparked debate over whether single-trial LIP spike trains are better described by discrete ""stepping"" or continuous ""ramping"" dynamics. We extended latent dynamical spike train models and used Bayesian model comparison to address this controversy. First, we incorporated non-Poisson spiking into both models and found that more neurons were better described by stepping than ramping, even when conditioned on evidence or choice. Second, we extended the ramping model to include a non-zero baseline and compressive output nonlinearity. This model accounted for roughly as many neurons as the stepping model. However, latent dynamics inferred under this model exhibited high diffusion variance for many neurons, softening the distinction between continuous and discrete dynamics. Results generalized to additional datasets, demonstrating that substantial fractions of neurons are well described by either stepping or nonlinear ramping, which may be less categorically distinct than the original labels implied."

Twenty healthy men performed 6 wk of high-intensity exercise training [i.e., speed endurance training (SET; n = 10)], or maintained their usual lifestyle (n = 10). Before and after the intervention, mitochondrial respiratory function was determined ex vivo in permeabilized muscle fibers under experimentally-induced normothermia (35°C) and hyperthermia (40°C) mimicking in vivo muscle temperature at rest and during intense exercise, respectively. In addition, activity and content of muscle mitochondrial enzymes and proteins were quantified. Exercising muscle efficiency was determined in vivo by measurements of leg hemodynamics and blood parameters during one-legged knee-extensor exercise. SET enhanced maximal OXPHOS capacity and OXPHOS efficiency at 40°C, but not at 35°C, and attenuated hyperthermia-induced decline in OXPHOS efficiency. Furthermore, SET increased expression of markers of mitochondrial content and up-regulated content of MFN2, DRP1, and ANT1. Also, SET improved exercise efficiency and capacity. These findings indicate that muscle mitochondrial bioenergetics adapts to high-intensity exercise training in a temperature-dependent manner and that enhancements in mitochondrial OXPHOS efficiency may contribute to improving exercise performance.-Fiorenza, M., Lemminger, A.

Clinical responses to the EGFR-targeting TKIs are evaluated through 2-[18F]fluoro-2-deoxy-glucose (18FDG)-PET uptake, which is decreased in patients responding favorably to therapy and is positively correlated with survival. Recent studies have reported that EGFR signaling drives glucose metabolism in NSCLC cells; however, the precise downstream effectors required for this EGFR-driven metabolic effect are largely unknown. 6-Phosphofructo-2-kinase/fructose-2,6-bisphosphatase (PFKFB3) is an essential glycolytic regulator that is consistently overexpressed in lung cancer. Here, we found that PFKFB3 is an essential target of EGFR signaling and that PFKFB3 activation is required for glycolysis stimulation upon EGFR activation. We demonstrate that exposing NSCLC cells harboring either WT or mutated EGFR to EGF rapidly increases PFKFB3 phosphorylation, expression, and activity and that PFKFB3 inhibition markedly reduces the EGF-mediated increase in glycolysis. Furthermore, we found that prolonged NSCLC cell exposure to the TKI erlotinib drives PFKFB3 expression and that chemical PFKFB3 inhibition synergizes with erlotinib in increasing erlotinib’s anti-proliferative activity in NSCLC cells. We conclude that PFKFB3 has a key role in mediating glucose metabolism and survival of NSCLC cells in response to EGFR signaling.

Copepods were collected from the pre-identified locations within the districts of Gampaha and Kandy, and identified morphologically. Individual species of copepods were maintained as separate colonies with Paramecium culture and wheat grain as supplementary food. Five adult copepods of each species was introduced into separate containers with 200 larvae (1st instar) of Aedes aegypti. Number of larvae survived in containers were enumerated at 3 hour intervals within a duration of 24 hours. Each experiment was repeated five times. The same procedure was followed for Ae. albopictus. Significance in the variations among predation rates was evaluated with General Linear Modelling (GLM) followed by Tukey’s pair-wise comparison in SPSS (version 23). Significant variations in predation rates of studied copepod species were reported (p<0.05), whereby M. leuckarti indicated the highest followed by M. scrassus, while C. languides indicated the lowest predatory efficacy. The effect of different Aedes larval species on the predation rates of copepods remained significant (p<0.05), even though the effect on predatory efficiency was not significant. Based on the findings, both M. leuckarti and M. scrassus, with the highest predatory efficiencies, could be recommended as potential candidates for biological controlling of Aedes vectors in Sri Lanka."

By capturing neurodegeneration-associated characteristics in a person's voice, the incorporation of novel methods based on the automatic analysis of speech signals may give us more information about a person's ability to interact which could contribute to the diagnostic process. In this proof-of-principle study, we demonstrate that purely acoustic features, extracted from recordings of patients' answers to a neurologist's questions in a specialist memory clinic can support the initial distinction between patients presenting with cognitive concerns attributable to progressive neurodegenerative disorders (ND) or Functional Memory Disorder (FMD, i.e., subjective memory concerns unassociated with objective cognitive deficits or a risk of progression). The study involved 15 FMD and 15 ND patients where a total of 51 acoustic features were extracted from the recordings. Feature selection was used to identify the most discriminating features which were then used to train five different machine learning classifiers to differentiate between the FMD/ND classes, achieving a mean classification accuracy of 96.2%. The discriminative power of purely acoustic approaches could be integrated into diagnostic pathways for patients presenting with memory concerns and are computationally less demanding than methods focusing on linguistic elements of speech and language that require automatic speech recognition and understanding."

We reported that Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) latent membrane protein 1 (LMP1) dysregulates cellular sumoylation processes, contributing to its oncogenic potential in EBV-associated malignancies. Ginkgolic acid and anacardic acid, known inhibitors of sumoylation, inhibit LMP1-induced protein sumoylation; however, both drugs have adverse effects in hosts. Here we test the effects of glycyrrhizic acid, a medicinal botanical extract with anti-inflammatory, anti-carcinogenic, and anti-viral properties, on cellular sumoylation processes. While glycyrrhizic acid is known to inhibit EBV penetration, its affect on cellular sumoylation processes remains to be documented. We hypothesized that glycyrrhizic acid inhibits cellular sumoylation processes and may be a viable treatment for Epstein-Barr virus-associated malignancies. Results showed that glycyrrhizic acid inhibited sumoylation processes (without affecting ubiquitination processes), limited cell growth, and induced apoptosis in multiple cell lines. Similar to ginkgolic acid; glycyrrhizic acid targeted the first step of the sumoylation process and resulted in low levels of spontaneous EBV reactivation. Glycyrrhizic acid did not affect induced reactivation of the virus, but the presence of the extract did reduce the ability of the produced virus to infect additional cells. Therefore, we propose that glycyrrhizic acid may be a potential therapeutic drug to augment the treatment of EBV-associated lymphoid malignancies."

So far, there is no study investigating the effect of cognitive-behavioral therapy on IAcc in patients with OCD. Therefore, we hypothesize that patients with OCD improve their IAcc during the time course of therapy compared to healthy controls. Twenty-six patients with OCD from the Psychosomatic Clinic in Windach were examined in the time course of cognitive-behavioral therapy. They were compared to 26 matched healthy controls. IAcc via the heartbeat perception task as well as questionnaire data (OCD-, depression- and anxiety symptoms) were assessed. Results showed that IAcc, OCD-, depression- and anxiety symptoms were attenuated in patients with OCD. Patients recovered in the time course of therapy regarding OCD-, depression- and anxiety symptoms. Interoceptive deficits did not change in the time course of cognitive-behavioral therapy. We demonstrated that IAcc is affected in patients with OCD and this deficit does not change during the time course of a standardized therapy. Future studies should investigate, whether an inaccuracy in perceiving one’s bodily signals constitutes a risk factor for relapse. Further, it could be examined if IAcc can be increased via self- and body focus interventions in patients with OCD."

Compared with the NC diets without phytase, diets with 1,000, 2,000, and 3,000 FYT/kg inclusion increased the daily weight gain by +12% (quadratic, p<0.05) during the growing I period; +2.9, +2.9, and +10.5% (linear, p<0.01), respectively, during the growing II period; and +4.1, +5.1, and +8.2% (linear, p<0.001), respectively, over the entire experimental period. The daily feed intake increased by 0, +2.8, and +4.3% (linear, p<0.05), respectively, considering the entire experimental period; and the final live weight increased by +3.2, +4.2, and +6.1% (linear, p<0.001), respectively. The phytase treatments did not influence feed conversion ratio, carcass weight and yield, backfat thickness, loin depth and carcass lean meat. According to the European Carcass Classification (SEUROP), however, the animals fed the PC diet and the three phytase levels had more carcasses classified as E (between 55–60% lean meat) when compared to carcasses of pigs fed the NC. Supplementing increasing levels of phytase to a corn- and soybean meal-based diet with inorganic P and Ca reduction improved daily weight gain and feed intake of growing pigs, and such effects were maintained until slaughter age."
https://openalex.org/W2945983479,"The Russian dandelion (Taraxacum koksaghyz) is a promising source of inulin and natural rubber because large amounts of both feedstocks can be extracted from its roots. However, the domestication of T. koksaghyz requires the development of stable agronomic traits such as higher yields of inulin and natural rubber, a higher root biomass, and an agronomically preferable root morphology which is more suitable for cultivation and harvesting. Arabidopsis thaliana Rapid Alkalinisation Factor 1 (RALF1) has been shown to suppress root growth. We identified the T. koksaghyz orthologue TkRALF-like 1 and knocked out the corresponding gene (TkRALFL1) using the CRISPR/Cas9 system to determine its impact on root morphology, biomass, and inulin and natural rubber yields. The TkRALFL1 knockout lines more frequently developed a taproot phenotype which is easier to cultivate and harvest, as well as a higher root biomass and greater yields of both inulin and natural rubber. The TkRALFL1 gene could therefore be suitable as a genetic marker to support the breeding of profitable new dandelion varieties with improved agronomic traits. To our knowledge, this is the first study addressing the root system of T. koksaghyz to enhance the agronomic performance."
https://openalex.org/W2946728464,"Objectives Sepsis presents a major burden to the emergency department (ED). Because empiric inappropriate antimicrobial therapy (IAAT) is associated with increased mortality, rapid molecular assays may decrease IAAT and improve outcomes. We evaluated the cost-effectiveness of molecular testing as an adjunct to blood cultures in patients with severe sepsis or septic shock evaluated in the ED. Methods We developed a decision analysis model with primary outcome the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio expressed in terms of deaths averted. Costs were dependent on the assay price and the patients’ length of stay (LOS). Three base-case scenarios regarding the difference in LOS between patients receiving appropriate (AAT) and IAAT were described. Sensitivity analyses regarding the assay cost and sensitivity, and its ability to guide changes from IAAT to AAT were performed. Results Under baseline assumptions, molecular testing was cost-saving when the LOS differed by 4 days between patients receiving IAAT and AAT (ICER -$7,302/death averted). Our results remained robust in sensitivity analyses for assay sensitivity≥52%, panel efficiency≥39%, and assay cost≤$270. In the extreme case that the LOS of patients receiving AAT and IAAT was the same, the ICER remained≤$20,000/death averted for every studied sensitivity (i.e. 0.5–0.95), panel efficiency≥34%, and assay cost≤$313. For 2 days difference in LOS, the bundle approach was dominant when the assay cost was≤$135 and the panel efficiency was≥77%. Conclusions The incorporation of molecular tests in the management of sepsis in the ED has the potential to improve outcomes and be cost-effective for a wide range of clinical scenarios."

The aim of this project was to determine the pharmacokinetic profile of oral (PO; 1.0 mg/kg BW) and subcutaneous meloxicam (SC; 0.5 mg/kg BW), and to assess the effect of meloxicam on physiological and behavioural indicators of pain associated with knife castration in 7-8 month old calves. Twenty-three Angus crossbred beef calves (328 ± 4.4 kg BW) were randomly assigned to two treatments: PO n = 12 or SC n = 11 administration of meloxicam immediately before knife castration. Physiological parameters included salivary and hair cortisol, substance P, haptoglobin, serum amyloid-A, weight, complete blood count, scrotal and rectal temperature. Behavioural parameters included standing and lying behaviour, pen behaviour and feeding behaviour. Data were analyzed using PROC GLIMMIX (SAS), with repeated measures using mixed procedures including treatment as a fixed effect and animal and pen as a random effect. The pharmacokinetic profile of the drug including area under the curve, volume of distribution and clearance was greater (P < 0.05) in PO than SC calves. After surgery, substance P concentrations, white blood cell counts (WBC), weight and lying duration were greater (P < 0.05) in PO than SC calves, while scrotal circumference was lower (P < 0.05) in PO calves than SC calves. Although statistical differences were observed for pharmacokinetic, physiological and behavioural parameters differences were small and may lack biological relevance."

HCMV encodes many immunomodulatory molecules, including the glycoprotein UL144. UL144 is a structural mimic of the tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily member HVEM (herpesvirus entry mediator), which binds to the various ligands LIGHT, LTα, BTLA, CD160, and gD. However, in contrast to HVEM, UL144 only binds BTLA, inhibiting T-cell activation. Here, we report the crystal structure of the UL144–BTLA complex, revealing that UL144 utilizes residues from its N-terminal cysteine-rich domain 1 (CRD1) to interact uniquely with BTLA. The shorter CRD2 loop of UL144 also alters the relative orientation of BTLA binding with both N-terminal CRDs. By employing structure-guided mutagenesis, we have identified a mutant of BTLA (L123A) that interferes with HVEM binding but preserves UL144 interactions. Furthermore, our results illuminate structural differences between UL144 and HVEM that explain its binding selectivity and highlight it as a suitable scaffold for designing superior, immune inhibitory BTLA agonists.

https://openalex.org/W2944960506,"Despite increased vaccination rates, the burden, morbidity and mortality associated with vaccine preventable diseases remains high. In the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), potentially unreliable data and geographically varied program provision call for a better understanding of vaccination coverage and its changes over time at the country and province level. To assess changes in the proportion of children who were fully vaccinated over time in the DRC, vaccination histories for children 12–59 months of age were obtained from both the 2007 and 2013–2014 Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS). Changes were assessed, both at the country- and province-levels, to identify potential geographic variations. Vaccination coverage improved 70% between the DHS waves: 26% compared to 44% of 12–59 month-old children met full vaccination criteria in 2007 and 2013–2014, respectively (n2007 = 3032 and n2013-14 = 6619). Similarly, there was an overall trend across both DHS waves where as year of birth increased, so did vaccination coverage. There was geographic variation in immunization changes with most central and eastern provinces increasing in coverage and most northern, western and southern provinces having decreased vaccination coverage at the second time point. Using nationally representative data, we identified significant changes over time in vaccination coverage which may help to inform future policy, interventions and research to improve vaccination rates among children in the DRC. This study is the first of its kind for the population of DRC and provides an important initial step towards better understanding trends in vaccination coverage over time."

In the former situation, the acute dissociation of cavin-1 from caveolae allows cell membrane expansion that occurs upon insulin-aided lipid uptake into the fat cells. Cavin-1 dissociation from caveolae and membrane flattening alters the cytoskeleton and the interaction of plasma membrane proteins with the extracellular matrix through interactions with focal adhesion structures. Here, using cavin-1 knockout mice, subcellular fractionation, and immunoblotting methods, we addressed the relationship of cavin-1 with focal adhesion complexes following nutritional stimulation. We found that cavin-1 is acutely translocated to focal complex compartments upon insulin stimulation, where it regulates focal complex formation through an interaction with paxillin. We found that loss of cavin-1 impairs focal complex remodeling and focal adhesion formation and causes a mechanical stress response, concomitant with activation of proinflammatory and senescence/apoptosis pathways. We conclude that cavin-1 plays key roles in dynamic remodeling of focal complexes upon metabolic stimulation.

https://openalex.org/W2946185686,"The ability of Mycobacterium tuberculosis to respond and adapt to various stresses such as oxygen/nitrogen radicals and low pH inside macrophages is critical for the persistence of this human pathogen inside its host. We have previously shown that an AraC/XylS-type transcriptional regulator, VirS, which is induced in low pH, is involved in remodeling the architecture of the bacterial cell envelope. However, how VirS influences gene expression to coordinate these pH responses remains unclear. Here, using a genetic biosensor of cytoplasmic pH, we demonstrate that VirS is required for the intracellular pH maintenance in response to acidic stress and inside acidified macrophages. Furthermore, we observed that VirS plays an important role in blocking phagosomal-lysosomal fusions. Transcriptomics experiments revealed that VirS affects the expression of genes encoding metabolic enzymes, cell-wall envelope proteins, efflux pumps, ion transporters, detoxification enzymes, and transcriptional regulators expressed under low-pH stress. Employing electrophoretic mobility-shift assays, DNA footprinting, and in silico analysis, we identified a DNA sequence to which VirS binds and key residues in VirS required for its interaction with DNA. A significant role of VirS in M. tuberculosis survival in adverse conditions suggested it as a potential anti-mycobacterial drug target. To that end, we identified VirS inhibitors in a virtual screen; the top hit compounds inhibited its DNA-binding activity and also M. tuberculosis growth in vitro and inside macrophages. Our findings establish that VirS mediates M. tuberculosis responses to acidic stress and identify VirS-inhibiting compounds that may form the basis for developing more effective anti-mycobacterial agents."
https://openalex.org/W2947235941,"In a population-based cohort of ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysms (rAAAs), our aim was to investigate clinical, morphological and biomechanical features in patients with small rAAAs.All patients admitted to an emergency department in Stockholm and Gotland, a region with a population of 2.1 million, between 2009-2013 with a CT-verified rupture (n = 192) were included, and morphological measurements were performed. Patients with small rAAAs, maximal diameter (Dmax) ≤ 60 mm were selected (n = 27), and matched 2:1 by Dmax, sex and age to intact AAA (iAAAs). For these patients, morphology including volume and finite element analysis-derived biomechanics were assessed.The mean Dmax for all rAAAs was 80.8 mm (SD = 18.9 mm), women had smaller Dmax at rupture (73.4 ± 18.4 mm vs 83.1 ± 18.5 mm, p = 0.003), and smaller neck and iliac diameters compared to men. Aortic size index (ASI) was similar between men and women (4.1 ± 3.1 cm/m2 vs 3.8 ± 1.0 cm/m2). Fourteen percent of all patients ruptured at Dmax ≤ 60 mm, and a higher proportion of women compared to men ruptured at Dmax ≤ 60 mm: 27% (12/45) vs. 10% (15/147), p = 0.005. Also, a higher proportion of patients with a chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ruptured at Dmax ≤ 60 mm (34.6% vs 14.6%, p = 0.026). Supra-renal aortic size index (14.0, IQR 13.3-15.3 vs 12.8, IQR = 11.4-14.0) and peak wall rupture index (PWRI, 0.35 ± 0.08 vs 0.43 ± 0.11, p = 0.016) were higher for small rAAAs compared to matched iAAAs. Aortic size index, peak wall stress and aneurysm volume did not differ.More than one tenth of ruptures occur at smaller diameters, women continuously suffer an even higher risk of presenting with smaller diameters, and this must be considered in surveillance programs. The increased supra-renal aortic size index and PWRI are potential markers for rupture risk, and patients under surveillance with these markers may benefit from increased attention, and potentially from timely repair."

Up to 3000 copies of the main pilus subunit, FimA, assemble into the filamentous, helical quaternary structure of the pilus rod via a mechanism termed donor-strand complementation, in which the N-terminal extension of each subunit, the donor strand, is inserted into the incomplete immunoglobulin-like fold of the preceding FimA subunit. For FimA from Escherichia coli, it has been previously shown that the protein can also adopt a monomeric, self-complemented conformation in which the donor strand is inserted intramolecularly in the opposite orientation relative to that observed for FimA polymers. Notably, soluble FimA monomers can act as apoptosis inhibitors in epithelial cells after uptake of type 1-piliated pathogens. Here, we show that the FimA orthologues from Escherichia coli, Shigella flexneri, and Salmonella enterica can all fold to form self-complemented monomers. We solved X-ray structures of all three FimA monomers at 0.89–1.69 Å resolutions, revealing identical, intramolecular donor-strand complementation mechanisms. Our results also showed that the pseudo-palindromic sequences of the donor strands in all FimA proteins permit their alternative folding possibilities. All FimA monomers proved to be 50–60 kJ/mol less stable against unfolding than their pilus rod-like counterparts (which exhibited very high energy barriers of unfolding and refolding).

In the following work, we show that the FimA orthologues from all three pathogens can indeed adopt alternative, assembly incompetent, monomeric conformations that likely represent the anti-apoptotic FimA form (13.Walczak M.J.

The previously solved NMR structure of the E. coli FimA monomer showed that it is capable of Intramolecular self-complementation, in which the N-terminal donor strand is inserted in the opposite orientation relative to that observed for inter-molecular donor strand complementation in FimA polymers (parallel to the C-terminal F-strand of FimA) (Fig. 1B) (13.Walczak M.J.

Further analysis indicated that the origin of these alternative folding possibilities of FimA lies in the pseudo-palindromic sequence of the FimA donor strand, with its center at His11 and two glycines (Gly8 and Gly14) three residues to either side (Fig. 1, C and D) (13.Walczak M.J.

Comparison of the NMR structure of the FimA monomer with that of a FimA variant, FimAa (which bears a second donor strand copy at its C terminus that inserts in the pilus rod-like, antiparallel orientation into the FimA-fold), revealed that the five donor strand side chain-binding pockets (P1–P5) of FimA were occupied by similar residues in both FimA conformers, with Gly8 and Gly14 defining the register of donor strand insertion (13.Walczak M.J.

Although FimAa could have incorporated either the N- or C-terminal donor strand into its fold, it exclusively folded to the conformer with the C-terminal donor strand inserted (antiparallel to the FimA F-strand). In contrast to FimA, FimAa proved to be extraordinarily stable against unfolding by denaturants and showed stability comparable with that of the pilus rod (14.Puorger C. Vetsch M. Wider G.

FimAa can, therefore, be considered a monomeric model for studying the structure and stability of FimA in the context of the pilus rod. The fact that the pseudo-palindromic element of the FimA donor strand is conserved among the FimA proteins of enteroinvasive bacteria (13.Walczak M.J. Puorger C. Glockshuber R. Wider G.

In this study, we addressed this question by testing the FimA proteins (FimAECO, FimASHI, and FimASAL) and the respective FimAa variants (FimAaECO, FimAaSHI, and FimAaSAL) from all three pathogens for their ability to adopt the two alternative conformations that previously had only been detected for E. coli FimA. FimAECO, FimASHI, and FimASAL were produced as reduced, insoluble proteins in the E. coli cytoplasm without their N-terminal signal sequences. All proteins were refolded in the absence of the chaperone FimC under oxidizing conditions to allow the formation of the single, invariant structural disulfide bond. The purified proteins were crystallized, and their X-ray structures were determined at 1.5, 0.89, and 1.69 Å resolution, respectively (Fig. 2, Table 1). All FimA orthologues crystallized as self-complemented monomers, and all structures strongly resembled the previously reported NMR structure of the FimAECO monomer (13.Walczak M.J. Puorger C. Glockshuber R. Wider G. Intramolecular donor strand complementation in the E. coli type 1 pilus subunit fima explains the existence of fima monomers as off-pathway products of pilus assembly that inhibit host cell apoptosis.J.

The Cα RMSD between the most representative model of the self-complemented FimAECO NMR structure (2M5G, model 10, calculated with OLDERADO server (22.Kelley L.A. Sutcliffe M.J.

Specifically, all three FimA monomers showed nearly identical immunoglobulin-like folds, completed by intramolecular donor strand insertion in a parallel orientation relative to the C-terminal F-strand (Fig. 2). In contrast to the intermolecular donor strand complementation (antiparallel to the FimA F-strand) observed for the assembled E. coli pilus rod, where the FimA side chains of Gly8, Val10, Phe12, Gly14, and Val16 from the donor strand occupy the binding pockets P1–P5 of the FimA-fold, the reversed (parallel) donor strand orientation in X-ray structure of self-complemented FimAECO showed the side chain occupancies P1/Gly14, P2/Phe12, P3/Val10, and P4/Gly8 (amino acid numbering according to E. coli FimA) (11.Hospenthal M.K. Zyla D. Costa T.R.D. Redzij A. Giese C. Lillington J. Glockshuber R. Waksman G. The cryoelectron microscopy structure of the type 1 chaperone-usher pilus rod.Structure. 2017; 25 (29129382): 1829-1838.e410.1016/j.str.2017.10.004Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Due to a lack of electron density, the occupancy of P5 with Val16, previously identified in the NMR structure of FimAECO, could not be confirmed in the X-ray structure, but the two structures otherwise proved to be essentially identical. The global folds and registers of parallel donor strand insertion in the X-ray structures of FimASHI and FimASAL were the same as those observed in FimAECO, and all three structures showed high surface complementarity between donor strand and the rest of the folded FimA domain (Fig. 1, A and B). The overall pairwise Cα RMSD values for the three X-ray structures were 0.30 Å for FimAECO/FimASHI (113 Cα atoms), 0.51 Å for FimAECO/FimASAL (154 Cα atoms), and 0.57 Å for FimASAL/FimASHI (110 Cα atoms), and the only minor conformational differences were restricted to loop segments 15–20, 37–45, and 89–97, and residues 51 and 81 (Fig. S1). The only significant difference in the mode of donor strand insertion was found for FimASAL, where Ser6 instead of Val5 occupied the P5 pocket, which caused a more extended conformation of the FimASAL donor strand segment Ser6–Gly7–Gly8 (Fig. 2C). Overall, the X-ray structures of FimAECO, FimASHI, and FimASAL demonstrated that the ability of FimA orthologues to adopt a self-complemented, monomeric conformation is based on the pseudo-palindromic nature of their donor strand, and that the register of donor strand insertion is dictated by the two invariant glycines (Gly8 and Gly14) in the donor strand, which are the only residues that can be accommodated by the very shallow pockets P1 and P4 without disrupting the β-sheet hydrogen-bonding network between the donor strand and the neighboring strand A and F. The fact that the pseudo-palindromic donor strand element Gly–hydrophilic–hydrophobic–Xaa–hydrophobic–hydrophilic–Gly is conserved in FimA subunits of type 1 piliated, enteroinvasive pathogens (13.Walczak M.J.

Open table in a new tab We next compared the thermodynamic stability of the monomeric FimA orthologues FimAECO, FimASHI, and FimASAL with the stability of the respective FimAa variants (Fig. 1), in which a hexa-glycine linker followed by a second copy of the donor strand was fused to the C terminus of FimA. Theoretically, the FimAa constructs can either incorporate the N- or C-terminal copy of their donor strand in the parallel or antiparallel orientation, respectively. In a previous study, we determined the NMR structure of E. coli FimAa (FimAaECO), which showed that FimAaECO exclusively folds to the more stable, pilus rod-like conformer in which the C-terminal donor strand is inserted in the antiparallel orientation, whereas the N-terminal donor strand was not incorporated into the fold and stayed flexibly disordered. In addition, the FimAa conformer can be readily distinguished from FimA due to its dramatically increased stability against unfolding (14.Puorger C. Vetsch M. Wider G. Glockshuber R. Structure, folding and stability of FimA, the main structural subunit of type 1 Pili from uropathogenic Escherichia coli strains.J. Mol. Biol. 2011; 412 (21816158): 520-53510.1016/j.jmb.2011.07.044Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). We purified FimAaECO, FimAaSHI, and FimAaSAL after oxidative refolding in vitro from insoluble aggregates. Like FimAaECO, FimAaSHI and FimAaSAL only adopted the more stable conformer in which the C-terminal donor strand copy was incorporated into the FimA-fold (see below). Fig. 3 shows the guanidine hydrochloride (GdnHCl)-dependent unfolding equilibria of the self-complemented WT monomers FimAECO, FimASHI, and FimASAL at pH 7.0 and 25 °C. All proteins unfolded/refolded reversibly and attained their folding equilibria after 1 day of incubation. Evaluation of the data according to the two-state model of folding revealed that all FimA orthologues proved to be only marginally stable, with free energies of folding at zero denaturant (ΔG0) of only −5.5, −8.9, and −7.2 kJ/mol for FimAECO, FimASHI, and FimASAL, respectively (Fig. 3, Table 2). In striking contrast, none of the FimAa orthologues reached its folding equilibrium under these conditions, even after prolonged incubation (Fig. 4A). Instead, the transitions of all FimAa constructs were characterized by unfolding at high and refolding at low denaturant concentrations. Although the unfolding and refolding transitions moved toward each other with increasing incubation time, they stayed widely separated even after 1 month of incubation (Fig. 4A). The nonequilibrium transitions of the FimAa orthologues proved to be fully consistent with an unattained two-state equilibrium in which the native and unfolded states are separated by a huge activation energy barrier (17.Puorger C.

Specifically, global analysis of all unfolding and refolding transitions of the FimAa variants recorded after different incubation times according to two-state folding yielded the characteristic, V-shaped plots of two-state folders in which the logarithm of the observed rate constant of folding/unfolding is plotted against denaturant concentration (Fig. 4B). Although the folding/unfolding equilibria could not be attained, this analysis allowed the calculation of the free energy of folding (ΔG0), the rate constants of folding and unfolding in the absence of denaturant (kF H2O and kUH2O) and the kinetic m-values of folding and unfolding (mF and mU) (Fig. 4, Table 2). The results showed that FimAaECO, FimAaSHI, and FimAaSAL are highly stable proteins with almost identical ΔG0 values of −66.5, −62.4, and −67.7 kJ/mol, respectively. This 7–12–fold increase in stability compared with the respective FimA counterpart is in full agreement with the extreme resistance of type 1 pili against dissociation and unfolding (17.Puorger C.

Here we identify aberrant expressions of inflammatory IL-17B and its receptor (IL-17RB) in human and mouse mixed lineage leukemia-rearranged AML cells, which were further increased after exposure to chemotherapy. Interestingly, silencing of IL-17B or IL-17RB led to significant suppression of leukemic cell survival and disease progression in vivo. Moreover, the IL-17B-IL-17RB axis protected leukemic cells from chemotherapeutic agent-induced apoptotic effects. Mechanistic studies revealed that IL-17B promoted AML cell survival by enhancing ERK, NF-κB phosphorylation, and the expression of antiapoptotic protein B-cell lymphoma 2, which were reversed by small-molecule inhibitors. Thus, the inhibition of the IL-17B-IL-17RB axis may be a valid strategy to enhance sensitivity and therapeutic benefit of AML chemotherapy.-Guo, H.-Z., Niu, L.-T., Qiang, W.-T., Chen, J., Wang, J., Yang, H., Zhang, W., Zhu, J., Yu, S.-H.

https://openalex.org/W2947900024,"Oral consumption of curcumin, a natural polyphenol, is associated with reduced incidence of cancer. Yet, a significant amount of the orally dosed compound is eliminated in the feces, and a major fraction of the absorbed compound is metabolized to inactive glucuronides, resulting in poor bioavailability (<1%). It is not known how oral curcumin exhibits chemopreventive activity. We propose curcumin glucuronide is an inflammation-responsive natural prodrug that is converted back to curcumin on demand at the site of action. Our studies show elevated levels of β-glucuronidase, an enzyme that hydrolyzes the glycosidic bond of glucuronides to generate the parent compound, in human breast cancer. Oral administration of curcumin in mouse tumor models generated significant tumor levels of the polyphenol. Intravenous administration of the glucuronide resulted in the formation of curcumin in the tumor tissue. Chronic daily oral curcumin dosing led to tumor accumulation of curcumin and inhibition of tumor growth in tumor models with high β-glucuronidase activity. Overall, the study presented here provides preliminary evidence for a novel mechanism of action for orally administered curcumin.-Liu, G., Khanna, V., Kirtane, A., Grill, A., Panyam, J.

Radiata pine plantations in New Zealand are impacted by a foliar disease, red needle cast (RNC), caused by Phytophthora pluvialis. This pathogen is dispersed by water splash with polycyclic infection affecting the lower part of the tree canopy. In this study, we extended an SI (Susceptible-Infectious) model presented for RNC to analyse the key epidemiological drivers. We conducted two experiments to empirically fit the extended model: a detached-needle assay and an in vivo inoculation. We used the detached-needle assay data to compare resistant and susceptible genotypes, and the in vivo inoculation data was used to inform sustained infection of the whole plant. We also compared isolations and real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR) to assess P. pluvialis infection. The primary infection rate and the incubation time were similar for susceptible and resistant genotypes. The pathogen death rate was 2.5 times higher for resistant than susceptible genotypes. Further, external proliferation of mycelium and sporangia were only observed on 28% of the resistant ramets compared to 90% of the susceptible ones. Detection methods were the single most important factor influencing parameter estimates of the model, giving qualitatively different epidemic outputs. In the early stages of infection, qPCR proved to be more efficient than isolations but the reverse was true at later points in time. Isolations were not influenced by the presence of lesions in the needles, while 19% of lesioned needle maximized qPCR detection. A primary infection peak identified via qPCR occurred at 4 days after inoculation (dai) with a secondary peak observed 22 dai. Our results have important implications to the management of RNC, by highlighting the main differences in the response of susceptible and resistant genotypes, and comparing the most common assessment methods to detect RNC epidemics."

Baseline characteristics were statistically similar. EVR levels were maintained at 3–8 ng/ml. TAC levels were 4.5±1.9 and 6.4±1.5 ng/ml in the TAC+EVR and TAC+MMF group respectively. Follow up was 14±4 and 17±5 months respectively and included protocol kidney biopsies at 3 and 12 months post-transplantation. Rejection-rate was lower in the TAC+EVR group. However patient and overall graft survival, eGFR and incidence of adverse events were similar. TAC+EVR induced expansion of CD4+CD25hiFoxp3+ regulatory T cells as early as 3 months and expansion of IFN-γ+CD4+CD25hiFoxp3+ regulatory T cells at 12 months post-transplant. Gene expression profile showed a trend toward decreased inflammation, angiogenesis and connective tissue growth in the TAC+EVR Group. Thus, greater tolerogenic mechanisms were found to be operating in patients with low dose TAC+EVR and this might be responsible for the lower rejection-rate than in patients on standard dose TAC+MMF. However, further studies with longer follow up and evaluating impact on T regulatory cells are warranted."

In the current study, we investigated whether Pif1 ablation alters whole body metabolism in response to weight gain. PIF1 KO and wild type (WT) C57BL/6J mice were fed a Western diet (WD) rich in fat and carbohydrates before evaluation of their metabolic phenotype. Compared with weight gain-resistant WT female mice, WD-fed PIF1 KO females, but not males, showed accelerated adipose deposition, decreased locomotor activity, and reduced whole-body energy expenditure without increased dietary intake. Surprisingly, PIF1 KO females did not show obesity-induced alterations in fasting blood glucose and glucose clearance. WD-fed PIF1 KO females developed mild hepatic steatosis and associated changes in liver gene expression that were absent in weight-matched, WD-fed female controls, linking hepatic steatosis to Pif1 ablation rather than increased body weight. WD-fed PIF1 KO females also showed decreased expression of inflammation-associated genes in adipose tissue. Collectively, these data separated weight gain from inflammation and impaired glucose homeostasis. They also support a role for Pif1 in weight gain resistance and liver metabolic dysregulation during nutrient stress."

This led e.g. to the discovery of mutant M11 that is able to metabolize a variety of drugs and drug-like compounds with relatively high activity. In order to further improve our understanding of CYP binding and reactions, we performed a co-crystallization study of mutant M11 and report here the three-dimensional structure M11 in complex with dithiothreitol (DTT) at a resolution of 2.16 Å.

To generate more evidence, this study used rigorous statistical analyses to assess the reduction in mortality attributable to PMI support. The study used generalized estimating equations and a series of matching procedures to evaluate the impact of PMI on under-five mortality and on population coverage of insecticide-treated nets (ITNs), indoor residual spraying (IRS), and artemisinin-based combination therapy (ACT) in SSA. The analyses used country-level secondary data and controlled for several country-level characteristics assumed to influence outcome measures of interest, PMI program participation, or both. The Mahalanobis distance metric, with 1:1 nearest neighbor matching adjusting for bias in population size in the particular country, showed a reduction in under-five mortality by approximately 12 per 1,000 live births (95% Confidence Interval [CI]: 20.6–3.1; p = 0.012). There were statistically significant increases in the population coverage of ITNs, IRS, and ACTs in PMI countries over the implementation period. ITN use in the population was 0.23% higher (95% CI average treatment effect on the treated: 0.17–0.30; p<0.001) in PMI-recipient countries than in non-PMI countries. The findings show that PMI contributed significantly to increasing the coverage of malaria control interventions and reducing under-five mortality in SSA."

Construction of preferences, including context and calculations, for clients in long-term care is challenging because of the variability in supply and demand. This study considers clients in four different sectors of long-term care: the nursing and care of the elderly, mental health care, care of people with disabilities, and social care. The aim is to understand the construction of preferences in real-life situations.Client choices were investigated by qualitative descriptive research. Data were collected from 16 in-depth interviews and 79 client records. Interviews were conducted with clients and relatives or informal caregivers from different care sectors. The original client records were explored, containing texts, letters, and comments of clients and caregivers. All data were analyzed using thematic analysis.Four cases showed how preferences were constructed during the decision-making process. Clients discussed a wide range of challenging aspects that have an impact on the construction of preferences, e.g. previous experiences, current treatment or family situation. This study describes two main characteristics of the construction of preferences: context and calculation.Clients face diverse challenges during the decision-making process on long-term care and their construction of preferences is variable. A well-designed tool to support the elicitation of preferences seems beneficial."

The aim of this prospective randomised comparative proof-of-concept study was to quantify urine production per time during stimulation of the lower urinary tract using different stimulation frequencies. Methods Ninety healthy subjects (18 to 36 years old) were included. Forty females and 50 males were randomly assigned to one of the following study groups: dome, trigone or proximal, membranous (males only) or distal urethra. Starting from 60mL prefilling, stimulation was performed at two separate visits with a 14 French custom-made catheter using randomly applied frequencies of 0.5Hz, 1.1Hz, 1.6Hz (each with 500 stimuli). After each stimulation cycle per frequency, urine production was assessed. Main outcome measures represented urine production during stimulation, daily life and their ratio. Results Lower urinary tract electrical stimulation increased urine production per time compared to bladder diary baseline values. Linear mixed model showed that frequency (p<0.001), stimulation order (p = 0.003), intensity (p = 0.042), and gender (p = 0.047) had a significant influence on urine production. Location, visit and age had no significant influence. Conclusions Urine production is increased during electrical stimulation with a bigger impact of higher frequencies. This might be relevant for methodological aspects in the assessment of lower urinary tract afferent function and for patients with impaired renal urine output. Inhibition of renal sympathetic nerve activity by vagal afferents may be the underlying mechanism."

Because of the special anatomic features of pancreatic neck, the selection of optimal surgical procedure for treatment of adenocarcinoma of pancreatic neck has always been a dilemma for surgeons. In this paper, we aim to investigate whether different surgical procedures can affect prognosis in the patient with adenocarcinoma of pancreatic neck. Methods We used the surveillance, epidemiology, and end results database to review patients with adenocarcinoma of pancreatic neck diagnosed between 1998 and 2015. We calculated overall survival (OS) and cancer-specific survival (CSS) of these patients using Kaplan-Meier analysis and Cox regression model. Results Overall, 1443 patients were included in the study, with 12.5% treated with surgical resection. Among them, 30 (18.8%) patients underwent distal pancreatectomy (DP), 105 (65.6%) patients underwent pancreatoduodenectomy (PD), and 25 (15.6%) patients underwent total pancreatectomy (TP). Patients underwent DP were older than these underwent TP (70.5±10.7 vs. 62.2±14.1, P = 0.027). Patients underwent TP had higher percentages of nodal metastasis (N1 stage) than these underwent DP (68.0% vs. 34.5%, P = 0.014). The surgical procedures did not significantly affect either OS times (P = 0.924) or CSS times (P = 0.786) in Kaplan-Meier analysis, even if in any subgroup of AJCC stage. The multivariate Cox regression model showed that types of surgery were not associated with OS and CSS. Higher tumor grade and AJCC stage are independent prognostic factors for OS and CSS. No radiotherapy was associated with a worse CSS (HR 1.610, 95% CI 1.016–2.554, P = 0.043). Conclusion Different surgical procedures did not affect prognosis in the patients with adenocarcinoma of pancreatic neck. TP should be performed in carefully selective patients in high-volume pancreatic centers."
https://openalex.org/W2946044572,"Background This study aimed to assess how maternal mental health mediates the association between childhood socio-economic conditions at birth and subsequent child behavioural and emotional problem scores. Methods Analysis of the Wirral Child Health and Development Study (WCHADS), a prospective epidemiological longitudinal study of the early origins of child mental health (n = 664). Household income at 20-weeks gestation, a measure of socio-economic conditions (SECs) in pregnancy, was the main exposure. The outcome measure was externalising and internalising problems, as measured by the Child Behaviour Checklist at 5 years. We assessed the association of household income with child behavioural outcomes in sequential linear models adjusting for maternal mental health in the pre- and post- natal period. Results Children of mothers in more disadvantaged households had higher scores for externalising behaviour with a difference of 3.6 points comparing the most affluent to the most disadvantaged families (the socio-economic (SEC) gap). In our regression model adjusting for baseline confounders, comparing children of mothers in the most disadvantaged households to the least disadvantaged, we found that most disadvantaged children scored 45 percentage points (95% CI 9, 93) higher for externalising problems, and 42% of this difference was explained in the fully adjusted model. Adjusting for prenatal maternal depressive symptomology attenuated the SEC gap in externalising problems by about a third, rendering the association non-significant, whilst adjusting for pre- and post-natal maternal mental health attenuated the SEC gap by 42%. There was no significant relationship between household income and internalising problems. Conclusion Social disadvantage is associated with higher child externalising behaviour problems score at age 5, and about 40% of this was explained by maternal perinatal mental health. Policies supporting maternal mental health in pregnancy are important to address the early emergence of inequalities in child mental health."
https://openalex.org/W2946218131,"Our affective state is influenced by daily events and our interactions with other people, which, in turn, can affect the way we communicate. In two studies, we investigated the influence of experiencing success or failure in a foosball (table soccer) game on participants' affective state and how this in turn influenced the way they report on the game itself. Winning or losing a match can further influence how they view their own team (compared to the opponent), which may also impact how they report on the match. In Study 1, we explored this by having participants play foosball matches in two dyads. They subsequently reported their affective state and team cohesiveness, and wrote two match reports, one from their own and one from their opponent's perspective. Indeed, while the game generally improved participants' moods, especially winning made them happier and more excited and losing made them more dejected, both in questionnaires and in the reports, which were analyzed with a word count tool. Study 2 experimentally investigated the effect of affective state on focus and distancing behavior. After the match, participants chose between preselected sentences (from Study 1) that differed in focus (mentioning the own vs. other team) or distancing (using we vs. the team name). Results show an effect for focus: winning participants preferred sentences that described their own performance positively while losing participants chose sentences that praised their opponent over negative sentences about themselves. No effect of distancing in pronoun use was found: winning and losing participants equally preferred the use of we vs. the use of their own team name. We discuss the implications of our findings with regard to models of language production, the self-serving bias, and the use of games to induce emotions in a natural way."

However, the genetic complexity and rapidly evolving nature of most cancer cells create challenges when identifying the most relevant kinases to inhibit to achieve optimal therapeutic benefits. A new strategy that takes advantage of a well-characterized multitargeted kinase inhibitor describes a nongenetic approach to tease out key kinases that promote proliferation of specific cancer cell types."
