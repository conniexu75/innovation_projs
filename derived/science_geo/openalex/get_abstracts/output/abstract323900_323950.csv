https://openalex.org/W1993332115,"Thermogenic gas hydrates were recovered from the upper few meters of bottom sediments in the northwestern Gulf of Mexico. The hydrates were associated with oil-stained cores at a water depth of 530 meters. The hydrates apparently occur sporadically in seismic ""wipeout"" zones of sediments in a region of the Gulf continental slope at least several hundred square kilometers in area."
https://openalex.org/W2146521865,Analysis of the effect of tobacco upon human longevity after age 30 using a random sample of 6813 men (grouped as nonusers of tobacco moderate smokers and heavy smokers) showed a significant impairment of survivorship among smokers with the impairment increasing as frequency of smoking increased. Beyond age 70 however differences in the mortality rates of the 3 groups practically disappeared possibly because of the immunity developed by resistent specimens against the harmful effects of tobacco.
https://openalex.org/W1980716010,Anomalously high values of atmospheric angular momentum and length of day were observed in late January 1983. This signal in the time series of these two coupled quantities appears to have been a consequence of the equatorial Pacific Ocean warming event of 1982-1983.

Target loadings of 14 to 16 kilograms of wet sulfate deposition per hectare per year, instead of 20 as suggested hitherto, are probably necessary to produce average pH values of 4.6 to 4.7, the approximate boundary levels for damage to aquatic ecosystems. Cluster analysis reveals that there are three linked groups of ions related to air pollution, agriculture, and sea spray."
https://openalex.org/W2063088309,"Competent larvae are induced to undergo metamorphosis by sand from a sand dollar bed or an aqueous extract of the sand. Gel permeation chromatography and high-performance liquid chromatography of the extract yielded a 980-dalton peptide that will induce metamorphosis between 10-6 and 10-5 molar. Extracts of whole adults and gonads were also able to induce metamorphosis, and adults can condition substrates to induce metamorphosis. Therefore, the initiation of metamorphosis in Dendraster excentricus is controlled by a pheromone released by adult sand dollars."

https://openalex.org/W2042654755,"Trace element analysis of obsidian artifacts from Moho Cay, Belize, reveals that the obsidian derives primarily from the El Chayal outcrop in highland Guatemala and not from the Ixtepeque source. This is contrary to the widely accepted obsidian trade route model for Classic Maya civilization and suggests that Classic Maya obsidian trade was a more complex economic phenomenon than has been recognized."
https://openalex.org/W2024023319,"Oil and gas deposits in the Alaskan Arctic are estimated to contain up to 40 percent of the remaining undiscovered crude oil and oil-equivalent natural gas within U.S. jurisdiction. Most (65 to 70 percent) of these estimated reserves are believed to occur offshore beneath the shallow, ice-covered seas of the Alaskan continental shelf. Offshore recovery operations for such areas are far from routine, with the primary problems associated with the presence of ice. Some problems that must be resolved if efficient, cost-effective, environmentally safe, year-round offshore production is to be achieved include the accurate estimation of ice forces on offshore structures, the proper placement of pipelines beneath ice-produced gouges in the sea floor, and the cleanup of oil spills in pack ice areas."

 that he had reported his findings to the Hungarian Medical Association well before C. G. King claimed the discovery of vitamin
 C."

https://openalex.org/W2019752964,"The open society, unlike the closed society, requires constant citizen thought and action to ensure that it will continue to survive and prosper. Today in the United States we should give particular attention to three immediate problems. We should reinvigorate our national economic health and international competitiveness, particularly by reducing our unprecedented budget deficits and reforming our tax system. We must strengthen our scientific and engineering vitality, particularly in graduate engineering education and in secondary school instruction in science and mathematics. And we should work with our allies in the free industrialized world to keep our international open society as open as possible, encouraging a flow of people and information and ideas across national boundaries while instituting sensible and efficient safeguards against leakage of critical military technology to the Soviet Union."
