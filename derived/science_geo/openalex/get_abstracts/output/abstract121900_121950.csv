https://openalex.org/W1978763812,"We have developed a sensitive assay for the AMP-activated protein kinase kinase, the upstream component in the AMP-activated protein kinase cascade. Phosphorylation and activation of the downstream kinase by the upstream kinase absolutely requires AMP and is antagonized by high (millimolar) concentrations of ATP. We have purified the upstream kinase >1000-fold from rat liver; a variety of evidence indicates that the catalytic subunit may be a polypeptide of 58 kDa. The physical properties of the downstream and upstream kinases, e.g. catalytic subunit masses (63 versus 58 kDa) and native molecular masses (190 versus 195 kDa), are very similar. However, unlike the downstream kinase, the upstream kinase is not inactivated by protein phosphatases. The upstream kinase phosphorylates the downstream kinase at a single major site on the α subunit, i.e. threonine 172, which lies in the “activation segment” between the DFG and APE motifs. This site aligns with activating phosphorylation sites on many other protein kinases, including Thr177 on calmodulin-dependent protein kinase I. As well as suggesting a mechanism of activation of AMP-activated protein kinase, this finding is consistent with our recent report that the AMP-activated protein kinase kinase can slowly phosphorylate and activate calmodulin-dependent protein kinase I, at least in vitro (Hawley, S. A., Selbert, M. A., Goldstein, E. G., Edelman, A. M., Carling, D., and Hardie, D. G. (1995) J. Biol. Chem. 270, 27186-27191).

The kinase is activated by elevation of the AMP:ATP ratio during cellular stress, and a current hypothesis for its physiological role is that it preserves ATP by switching off biosynthesis whenever cellular ATP levels are compromised by adverse cellular environments (8Corton J.M.

The functions of the β and γ subunits remain unknown, but both may also exist as multiple isoforms (14Stapleton D. Mitchelhill K.I. Gao G. Widmer J. Michell B.J. Teh T. House C.M. Fernandez C.S.

Gao G. Michell B.J. Widmer J. Mitchelhill K. Teh T. House C.M. Witters L.A. Kemp B.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29343-29346Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Snf4p has been shown to form a stable complex with Snf1p (17Celenza J.L. Eng F.J. Carlson M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 5045-5054Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar), while both Snf4p (18Fields S. Song O.K. Nature. 1989; 340: 245-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (4880) Google Scholar) and either Sip1p or Sip2p (19Yang X. Jiang R. Carlson M. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5878-5886Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 20Yang X. Hubbard E.J. Carlson M. Science. 1992; 257: 680-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar) form complexes with Snf1p in vivo as assessed by the two-hybrid assay. Thus all three subunits of mammalian AMPK have counterparts in S. cerevisiae. Genetic evidence shows that functional SNF1 (and SNF4) genes are required for the response to glucose starvation (17Celenza J.L. Eng F.J. Carlson M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 5045-5054Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 21Celenza J.L. Carlson M. Science. 1986; 233: 1175-1180Crossref PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar), which in yeast could be regarded as an acute stress situation. In particular, Snf1p is required for derepression of genes that are normally repressed in the presence of glucose (21Celenza J.L. Carlson M. Science. 1986; 233: 1175-1180Crossref PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar), while it is also required for inactivation of acetyl-CoA carboxylase, which occurs in response to starvation (22Woods A. Munday M.R. Scott J. Yang X. Carlson M. Carling D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19509-19515Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). At present little is known about regulation of Snf1p, but the regulation of mammalian AMPK is better characterized. 5′-AMP not only allosterically activates the kinase but is also required for phosphorylation and activation by an upstream protein kinase termed AMP-activated protein kinase kinase (AMPKK) (23Moore F. Weekes J. Hardie D.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 199: 691-697Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar, 24Weekes J. Hawley S.A. Corton J. Shugar D. Hardie D.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 219: 751-757Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 25Corton J.M. Gillespie J.G. Hawley S.A. Hardie D.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 229: 558-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (1036) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation by AMPKK results in at least 50-fold activation, which can be further amplified by the 5-fold allosteric effect of AMP (25Corton J.M. Gillespie J.G. Hawley S.A. Hardie D.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 229: 558-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (1036) Google Scholar). We have also recently reported that micromolar concentrations of AMP dramatically inhibit dephosphorylation and inactivation of AMPK by protein phosphatase-2C (26Davies S.P. Helps N.R. Cohen P.T.W. Hardie D.G. FEBS Lett. 1995; 377: 421-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar). Initially it was unclear whether the effect of AMP on phosphorylation of AMPK by AMPKK was due to binding of the nucleotide to the substrate (AMPK), to the enzyme (AMPKK), or to both. Although we reported that the former mechanism could explain the effect, at least in part (24Weekes J. Hawley S.A. Corton J. Shugar D. Hardie D.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 219: 751-757Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), more recently we have presented evidence that AMP also activates AMPKK directly, i.e. that the latter is itself an AMP-activated protein kinase (27Hawley S.A. Selbert M.A. Goldstein E.G. Edelman A.M. Carling D. Hardie D.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27186-27191Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar). An answer to this question was possible because we found that AMPKK would also phosphorylate and activate (at least in vitro) calmodulin-dependent protein kinase I, an enzyme that was not itself sensitive to AMP. These findings show that the upstream protein kinase AMPKK plays an active role in the overall activation of the cascade by AMP rather than merely being a passive, constitutively active partner. This makes the further characterization of AMPKK an important goal. Here we report on the purification and some physical and regulatory properties of AMPKK, and we also identify the major site at which it phosphorylates and activates AMPK. 5′-AMP and ATP were from Boehringer (Lewes, UK).

FEBS Lett. 1994; 361: 191-195Crossref Scopus (269) Google Scholar) were synthesized and purified as described previously. AMPK-α antiserum was raised against the peptide PGLKPHPERMPPLI (residues 361-374 of AMPK-α2 (12Carling D. Aguan K. Woods A. Verhoeven A.J.M. Beri R.K. Brennan C.H. Sidebottom C. Davison M.D. Scott J.

AMPK-β antiserum was raised against bacterially expressed β subunit (33Woods A. Cheung P.C.F. Smith F.C. Davison M.D. Scott J. Beri R.K. Carling D. J. Biol.

The protease inhibitors benzamidine (1 mM), soybean trypsin inhibitor (1 µg/ml), and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (1 mM) were added to buffers A, B, C, and D immediately prior to use (buffer A: 0.05 I Tris/HCl, pH 8.4, at 4°C, 0.25 M mannitol, 50 mM NaF, 5 mM sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM EGTA, 1 mM dithiothreitol; buffer B: 0.05 I Tris/HCl, pH 7.4 at 4°C, 0.25 M mannitol, 50 mM NaF, 5 mM sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM EGTA, 0.02% (w/v) Brij-35, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 1 mM dithiothreitol; buffer C: as buffer B but without NaF and sodium pyrophosphate; buffer D: buffer C plus 0.1 M NaCl, 50 mM MgCl2; buffer E: 50 mM Na-Hepes, pH 7.0, 0.02% (w/v) Brij-35, 1 mM dithiothreitol. PP2A was assayed using phosphorylase a (31Cohen P. Alemany S. Hemmings B.A. Resink T.J. Strålfors P. Lim T.H. Methods Enzymol. 1988; 159: 390-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar). One unit of PP2A dephosphorylates 1 µmol of substrate/min at 30°C. AMPK was assayed as described (34Davies S.P. Carling D. Hardie D.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 186: 123-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar) except that, unless stated otherwise, the AMARA peptide (200 µM) replaced SAMS. One unit of AMPK phosphorylates 1 µmol of peptide/min at 30°C. AMPKK was assayed by its ability to reactivate dephosphorylated AMPK; a single preparation of AMPK was used throughout these studies. The preparation was stored frozen at −70°C in small aliquots at 10 units/ml in buffer C. Before use it was diluted to 2 units/ml in buffer C containing 50% glycerol; in this form it could be stored at −20°C for up to a month. AMPK (0.013 units/ml in buffer E) was inactivated by incubation with PP2AC (6 milliunits/ml final concentration) at 30°C for 10 min. PP2A was inhibited by the addition of okadaic acid to 100 nM final. Three volumes of dephosphorylated AMPK were added to 1 volume of ATP, MgCl2, and AMP in buffer E, and 3 volumes of this mixture was added to 1 volume of AMPKK in buffer E. Final concentrations were 1 mM ATP, 5 mM MgCl2, and 100 µM AMP. The reaction was incubated at 30°C, and 5-µl aliquots were removed at 0 and 25 min for the AMPK assay as described above. One unit of AMPKK was that amount which increased the activity of dephosphorylated AMPK by 1 unit/ml (calculated at the dilution of the stock AMPK) per min at 30°C. Protein concentration was determined by the method of Bradford (35Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217548) Google Scholar). SDS-PAGE was on 10% gels using the method of Laemmli (36Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207538) Google Scholar) in a Bio-Rad Mini-Protean II gel apparatus unless stated otherwise. AMPK was purified using modifications of the previous method (11Carling D. Clarke P.R. Zammit V.A. Hardie D.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 186: 129-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar). All procedures were at 4°C unless stated otherwise. Livers from male Wistar rats were left at room temperature for 1-2 min to become hypoxic (this elevates AMP and activates AMPK (5Davies S.P. Carling D. Munday M.R. Hardie D.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 203: 615-623Crossref Scopus (145) Google Scholar)), chopped coarsely, and washed in buffer A. A 2.5-6% polyethylene glycol 6000 (PEG) fraction was prepared as described (11Carling D. Clarke P.R. Zammit V.A. Hardie D.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 186: 129-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar), resuspended in buffer B using a ground glass homogenizer, and applied to a DEAE-Sepharose (Fast Flow) column (6 × 15 cm). The column was washed until A280 < 0.05, and protein was eluted with buffer B plus 0.2 M NaCl. Active fractions were loaded directly onto blue-Sepharose (5 × 7 cm) and washed extensively, and protein was eluted with buffer B plus 0.8 M NaCl. Active fractions were precipitated with ammonium sulfate, resuspended, and dialyzed as for the previous procedure (11Carling D. Clarke P.R. Zammit V.A. Hardie D.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 186: 129-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar) and then clarified by centrifugation (20,000 × g, 10 min). The preparation was applied to a Q-Sepharose HiLoad 16/10 column at 3 ml/min, the column was washed until A280 was <0.05, and protein was eluted with a linear gradient from 0 to 450 mM NaCl in buffer B. Active fractions were pooled, concentrated to <0.5 ml in Centricon-30 concentrators, and applied to a high performance Sephacryl S-200 HiLoad column in buffer C at 0.5 ml/min. Active fractions were pooled, concentrated to 10 units/ml in Centricon-30 concentrators, frozen in small aliquots in liquid N2, and stored at −70°C. All procedures were at 4°C unless stated otherwise. The 6% PEG supernatant from the AMPK preparation above was made to 10% (w/v) PEG and centrifuged (30,000 × g, 20 min). The pellet was resuspended in buffer B and applied to a DEAE-Sepharose (Fast Flow) column (6 × 15 cm). The column was washed until A280 was <0.05, and protein was eluted with buffer B plus 0.2 M NaCl. Active fractions were loaded directly onto Blue-Sepharose (5 × 7 cm), and the flow-through was applied to a high performance Q-Sepharose HiLoad 16/10 column in buffer B plus 200 mM NaCl at 3 ml/min. The column was washed until A280 was <0.05 and then AMPKK was eluted with a 96-ml linear gradient from 200 to 500 mM NaCl in buffer B. Active fractions were pooled, concentrated to <0.5 ml in Centricon-30 concentrators, diluted 3-fold in buffer C, and applied to a Mono Q (HR 5/5) column at 1 ml/min. The column was washed until A280 was <0.05, and then AMPKK was eluted with gradients from 0 to 50 mM MgCl2 (1 min) and 50-100 mM MgCl2 (24 min) in buffer C. Active fractions were pooled, concentrated to <0.5 ml in Centricon-30 concentrators, and then diluted 3-fold in buffer D. An ATP-γ-Sepharose (9Davies S.P. Hawley S.A. Woods A. Carling D. Haystead T.A.J. Hardie D.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 223: 351-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar) column (1.5 ml) was equilibrated in buffer D. AMPKK was applied, stirred into the matrix, and allowed to stand for 20 min. The column was washed at ∼1 ml/min with 40 ml of buffer D and then 25 ml of buffer D plus 5 mM ATP. Active fractions were pooled, concentrated in Centricon-30 concentrators, frozen in small aliquots in liquid N2, and stored at −70°C. Aliquots of the Q-Sepharose fraction were stored in the same way and used in some experiments (Fig. 1, Fig. 2, Fig. 3, Fig. 4-10).Fig. 4Recovery of AMPKK activity (filled squares) after gel filtration on a column (60 × 1.6 cm) of Sephacryl S-200.

Lane 3 shows a similar sample analyzed on the PhosphorImager after labeling with [14C]FSBA: the radioactivity migrating at the dye front was also observed in a control incubated without AMPKK (not shown).

The column was calibrated prior to use, using markers of known Stokes radii (Sigma gel filtration markers). For gradient centrifugation, AMPKK (amount and purity as for gel filtration) was layered with or without marker proteins (8.9 S sweet potato β-amylase and 4.4 S bovine serum albumin) onto a glycerol gradient (10-20% (v/v), 14 ml) in buffer B. A third tube contained marker proteins alone. The tubes were centrifuged in a Beckman SW 28 rotor (100,000 × g, 42 h, 4°C). Fractions (0.5 ml) were collected from the bottom of the tube using a Nyegaard gradient unloader and analyzed for protein (A280) and AMPKK activity. AMPKK (125 µg/ml, ATP-γ-Sepharose preparation in buffer E) was incubated at 30°C for 40 min with either (a) 200 µM [γ-32P]ATP (1.5 × 106 cpm/nmol) or (b) 200 µM of [14C]FSBA (80,000 dpm/nmol). Reactions were stopped by the addition of SDS-PAGE sample buffer. Autoradiography (ATP labeling) was performed on dried gels at −70°C using Hyperfilm-β max with Kodak X-Omatic intensifying screens. Phosphor imaging (FSBA labeling) was performed using a Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager. AMPKK (770 units/ml) was incubated with protein phosphatases PP2AC (50 milliunits/ml), PP2A1 (50 milliunits/ml), PP1γ (50 milliunits/ml), PP2C (1.5 milliunits/ml), CL-100 (6 µg/ml), or LAR (6 milliunits/ml) for 20 min at 30°C in buffer C. AMPK was purified to the gel filtration step as described above, except that NaF and sodium pyrophosphate were omitted from the gel filtration buffer. AMPK (14,000 units) was dephosphorylated using PP2AC (500 milliunits) for 15 min at 30°C in 8 ml of buffer C. The reaction was stopped by adding okadaic acid to 100 nM, and then incubation was continued for 8 min in the presence of AMP (100 µM), MgCl2 (5 mM), and [γ-32P]ATP (200 µM; 400 cpm/pmol) in the presence or absence of AMPKK (210 units). Reactivation was terminated by the addition of EDTA to 20 mM, and then AMPK was immunoprecipitated by five sequential additions of anti-AMPK-β subunit antibody. In each case, 200 µl of a 50% (v/v) slurry of protein A-Sepharose in buffer B containing 1% (w/v) Triton X-100 was added, and the resulting mixture was incubated for 2 h at 4°C with constant shaking. The immunocomplex was collected by centrifugation and washed extensively with buffer B containing 1% (w/v) Triton X-100. The immunoprecipitates were combined, boiled with SDS-PAGE sample buffer, resolved by SDS-PAGE on 10% gels, and transferred electrophoretically to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (37Matsudaira P. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 10035-10038Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Peptides were digested on polyvinylidene difluoride membranes using trypsin (37Matsudaira P. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 10035-10038Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The membranes were stained with sulforhodamine (Eastman Kodak Co.) (38Coull J.M. Pappin D.J.C. J. Prot. Chem. 1990; 9: 259-264Google Scholar). Regions of the membrane containing the α and β subunits were excised, cut into ∼4 × 4-mm pieces, and incubated with sufficient trypsin solution (100 µg/ml in 200 mM NH4HCO3 containing 1% (w/v) n-octyl β-D-glucopyranoside) to fully wet the membranes. After 24 h at room temperature, 0.1 volume of 100 mM dithiothreitol in buffer A was added, and incubation continued for a further 24 h. The membrane pieces were extracted once with 0.6-1.0 ml of buffer A, followed by transfer of the supernatant to clean polypropylene tubes. This first extract contained about 70% of the total counts; subsequent extraction of the membrane pieces with the same volume of buffer A and then the same volume of 50% formic acid:methanol resulted in extraction of a further 15 and 8% respectively. These extracts were dried on a rotary evaporator and resuspended in 200-300 µl of 0.1% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid. In order to keep the octyl glucoside concentration below 2% (w/v), to 50-µl aliquots of these samples 10 µl of 100 mM dithiothreitol was added followed by 50 µl of 0.1% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid and then 10 µl of 10% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid. Aliquots were then subjected to reversed phase HPLC using a 2.1 × 100-mm Aquapore OD300 C18 column (Applied Biosystems) at a flow rate of 250 µl/min. Fractions were collected at 1-min intervals. The column was washed with 0.1% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid in acetonitrile:water (3:97) for 5 min, followed by a gradient (5-90 min) from 3 to 60% of 0.1% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid in acetonitrile:water (9:1). Some of the radioactive peaks from these initial runs were pooled, dried by rotary evaporation, and resuspended in 50 µl of buffer F (10 mM ammonium acetate pH 6.5) followed by 10 µl of 10 mM dithiothreitol and 60 µl of 200 mM ammonium acetate, pH 6.5. Peptides were separated by reversed phase HPLC as before except using buffer F in place of 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. Recovery of radioactivity from HPLC in either buffer was 50-70′. Fractions containing radiolabeled peptides were pooled and dried down onto a Sequelon arylamine membrane disc (Millipore Corp.). The peptides were coupled to the disc according to manufacturer's instructions, and the discs were washed with 1 ml of 50% (v/v) methanol followed by 1 ml of 0.1% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid in 50% (v/v) acetonitrile. Coupling efficiencies, as determined by counting of radioactivity, were ∼90%. The membrane discs were subjected to N-terminal sequencing using a modified ABI 475 gas phase sequencer, which either injected 100 out of 120 µl of the PTH-derivative into the HPLC analyzer or delivered the whole fraction into a fraction collector. Solvent S3 was 70% (v/v) acetonitrile. The radioactivity in the PTH-derivative fraction was determined by scintillation counting using a Wallac 1218 counter. Purification and cha"

The removal is accomplished by glutamate transporters located in the plasma membranes of both neurons and astroglia. The uptake system consists of several different transporter proteins that are carefully regulated, indicating more refined functions than simple transmitter inactivation. Here we show by chemical cross-linking, followed by electrophoresis and immunoblotting, that three rat brain glutamate transporter proteins (GLAST, GLT and EAAC) form homomultimers. The multimers exist not only in intact brain membranes but also after solubilization and after reconstitution in liposomes. Increasing the cross-linker concentration increased the immunoreactivity of the bands corresponding to trimers at the expense of the dimer and monomer bands. However, the immunoreactivities of the dimer bands did not disappear, indicating a mixture of dimers and trimers. GLT and GLAST do not complex with each other, but as demonstrated by double labeling post-embedding electron microscopic immunocytochemistry, they co-exist side by side in the same astrocytic cell membranes. The oligomers are held together noncovalently in vivo. In vitro, oxidation induces formation of covalent bonds (presumably -S-S-) between the subunits of the oligomers leading to the appearance of oligomer bands on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Immunoprecipitation experiments suggest that GLT is the quantitatively dominant glutamate transporter in the brain. Radiation inactivation analysis gives a molecular target size of the functional complex corresponding to oligomeric structure.

INTRODUCTIONThe majority of excitatory signals in the mammalian central nervous system may be transmitted by glutamate (1Fonnum F. J. Neurochem. 1984; 42: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (1670) Google Scholar). The extracellular glutamate concentration has to be kept low, both to secure a high signal-to-noise (background) ratio and because excessive glutamate receptor activation can lead to neuronal damage (2Olney J.W. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1990; 30: 47-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar). This is achieved by the action of sodium-dependent glutamate transporters located in the plasma membranes of both glial cells and neurons (3Danbolt N.C. Prog. Neurobiol. (New York). 1994; 44: 377-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar).

Thus, the functions of these carriers may be more refined than simple removal of excitatory amino acids.It is legitimate to ask whether the glutamate transporters might form oligomeric complexes. Several glutamate transporter subtypes exist (see above). These proteins have been reported to aggregate (21Danbolt N.C. Storm-Mathisen J. Kanner B.I. Neuroscience. 1992; 51: 295-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar, 22Levy L.M. Lehre K.P. Rolstad B. Danbolt N.C.

Neurosci. 1995; 15: 1835-1853Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Recent reports conclude that some other co-transporters may exist in vivo as oligomers (24Béliveau R. Demeule M. Ibnoul-Khatib H.

FEBS Lett. 1995; 368: 389-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar. The glutamate transporters behave like a combination of carriers and chloride channels (18Mennerick S. Zorumsky C.F. Nature. 1994; 368: 59-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar, 29Wadiche J.I. Amara S.G. Kavanaugh M.P. Neuron. 1995; 15: 721-728Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar). Several neurotransmitter receptors, including ionotropic glutamate receptors, operate as hetero-oligomeric complexes (30McBain C.J. Mayer M.L. Physiol. Rev. 1994; 74: 723-760Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar, 31Bettler B. Mulle C. Neuropharmacology. 1995; 34: 123-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar).Here we show by double labeling post-embedding electron microscopic immunocytochemistry that the two glial glutamate transporters GLT and GLAST are expressed in the same cell membranes. Furthermore, we demonstrate that GLT and GLAST, as well as the neuronal glutamate transporter EAAC, form oligomeric complexes but that GLT and GLAST do not complex with each other. Evidence suggests that oligomeric structure is required for transport activity.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—Sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) of high purity (.99% C12 alkyl sulfate) and bis(sulfosuccinimidyl) suberate were from Pierce. Nitrocellulose sheets (0.22-mm pores, 100% nitrocellulose) and electrophoresis equipment were from Hoefer Scientific Instruments (San Francisco, CA). N,N9-Methylenebisacrylamide, acrylamide, ammonium persulfate, TEMED, and alkaline phosphatase substrates (nitro blue tetrazolium and 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate) were from Promega (Madison, WI). Alkaline phosphatase conjugated to mouse monoclonal anti-rabbit IgG (A-2556, clone RG-96) was obtained from Sigma and used at 1:10,000. Glutaraldehyde, EM grade, was from TAAB (Reading, UK). Lowicryl HM20 was from (Lowi, Switzerland). (S)-[3H]Glutamic acid (50 Ci/mmol), molecular mass markers for SDSpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE), and colloidal gold-labeled second antibodies (GAR15, GAR30) were from Amersham (Buckinghamshire, UK). Cholic acid was purified with activated charcoal and by recrystallization from 70% ethanol. Wheat germ agglutinin was immobilized to agarose as described previously (21,). All other reagents were either obtained from Sigma or from Fluka (Buchs, Switzerland).Production of Antibodies—Anti-peptide antibodies against three glutamate transporters (15Lehre K.P. Levy L.M. Ottersen O.P. Storm-Mathisen J. Danbolt N.C. J. Neurosci. 1995; 15: 1835-1853Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and one glycine transporter (32Zafra F. Aragón C. Olivares L. Danbolt N.C. Giménez C.

The anti-A522 antibodies from rabbit 20604 were produced by immunizing with whole GLAST protein isolated from rat cerebellum and affinity purifying antibodies from the crude serum using the A522 peptide. The two anti-A522 antibodies from rabbit 68488 and 20604 gave identical immunoblot labeling patterns. Unless stated otherwise, anti-A522 refers to antibodies from rabbit 20604.Electron Microscopic ImmunocytochemistryTissue was perfusion-fixed with 2.5% glutaraldehyde, 1% formaldehyde, freeze-substituted with 0.5% uranyl acetate in methanol, embedded in Lowicryl HM20 at low temperature, and further processed as described before using the same antibodies and concentrations (14Chaudhry F.A.

Immunoblot experiments showed no cross-reactivity between the antibodies. Double immunogold labeling was performed by the method of Wang and Larsson (35Wang B.L. Larsson L.I.

The virus was a generous gift from B. Moss (National Institutes of Health). The transfected HeLa cells were detached from the flasks and collected by centrifugation (1000 rpm, 5 min).Tissue Preparation for BiochemistryWistar rats (180-250 g) of both sexes (Møllegaard Hansen, Denmark) were killed by stunning and decapitation. The forebrain and cerebellum were dissected, homogenized immediately in 10-20 volumes of ice-cold hypotone solution (5 mM EDTA, 1 mM PMSF) using a Dounce glass-glass homogenizer. DTT (5 mM) was added when not stated otherwise. The homogenate was centrifuged (18,000 rpm, 39,000 × g, 4°C, 15 min) to sediment cell membranes. Preparation of membranes from transfected HeLa cells was done in the same way. Below, the sedimented membranes are referred to as “the membrane pellet.” When stated, membranes were prepared as described (34Danbolt N.C. Pines G. Kanner B.I. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 6734-6740Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar) by homogenizing in 0.32 M mannitol, isolation of the crude synaptosomal fraction, and sedimentation of the membranes after osmotic shock.Cross-linking of Membrane ProteinsFor cross-linking of proteins in intact membranes, the membrane pellets (see under “Tissue Preparation” above) were resuspended in buffer (150 mM NaCl, 100 mM Na-HEPES, pH 7.5, 5 mM EDTA, 1 mM PMSF, 5 mM DTT) to a final protein concentration of about 0.5 mg/ml and divided in aliquots. To the membrane suspensions, protein solutions, or liposomes a cross-linker was added (bis(sulfosuccinimidyl) suberate when not stated otherwise) to final concentrations of 0.3, 1, 3, 10, or 30 mM from a freshly prepared 100 mM stock solution in 20 mM HCl. After incubation (12 min, room temperature, end-over-end mixing), the reaction was terminated by adding 2 M Tris-HCl, pH 9, to a final concentration of 200 mM. Then the membranes were solubilized in SDS-sample buffer (70 mM SDS, 62.5 mM Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 0.3 M sucrose, 10 µg/ml bromphenol blue), gel-filtered (11Trotti D. Volterra A. Lehre K.P. Rossi D.

One volume of resuspended membranes was mixed with 0.35 volumes of saturated ammonium sulfate and 2 volumes of solubilization buffer consisting of buffer (5 mM EDTA, 1 mM PMSF, 5 mM DTT, and 100 mM Na-HEPES, pH 7.5) with a detergent (33 mM CHAPS, 3.3 µl/ml Triton X-100, or 50 mM cholate). After incubation (10 min, 0°C) and centrifugation (39,000 × g, 18,000 rpm, 4°C, 20 min), the supernatant was diluted 1 + 4 with buffer and detergent to give final detergent concentrations of 20 mM CHAPS, 1 µl/ml Triton X-100, or 30 mM cholate. The saturated ammonium sulfate was replaced with 5 M NaCl for cross-linking experiments (see below) or omitted when the membranes were solubilized with 1% SDS.Immunoabsorption of Glutamate TransportersAliquots of 100 µl of protein A-Sepharose Fast Flow was mixed with either anti-B12, anti-B493, anti-A522 or preimmune IgG, incubated (1 h, room temperature) with 20% newborn calf serum, and equilibrated with buffer (500 mM NaCl, 5 mM EDTA, 1 mM PMSF, 10 mM NaPi, pH 7.4, 0.1% Tween 20 and 0.05% NaN3). The buffer above the settled gel surface was removed. Membranes were solubilized (see above) with cholate. Reducing agents were omitted to avoid reduction of the antibodies. 200 µl of extract and 80 µl of buffer (500 mM NaCl, 1.25% cholate, 5 mM EDTA, 1 mM PMSF, 10 mM NaPi pH 7.4) were added to each protein A-Sepharose tube and incubated (4°C, end-over-end, 30 or 60 min). Then the supernatants were collected for reconstitution of transport activity (see below) and for SDS-PAGE. The precipitated protein was released from the Sepharose beads by boiling in SDS-sample buffer with 5% mercaptoethanol and subjected to SDS-PAGE. The proteins were immunoblotted with biotinylated (not shown) or regular non-biotinylated (Fig. 4) anti-GLT and anti-GLAST antibodies. The rabbit IgG that had been boiled in SDS-sample buffer containing mercaptoethanol and blotted, was poorly detected by the secondary antibody used.Partial Purification of Glutamate TransportersGlutamate transporters were partially purified from rat forebrain by lectin affinity chromatography (34Danbolt N.C. Pines G. Kanner B.I. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 6734-6740Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar) and eluted from the columns in buffer with a detergent (20 mM CHAPS, 50 mMβ-octylglucoside, or 15 mM Zwittergent 3-12). 10 mM DTT was added to the purified fractions. Some aliquots of the fractions were mixed with cross-linkers (see below). Other aliquots were incubated (15 min, 0°C) in the elution buffer, the proteins collected on DEAE-cellulose columns, and the detergent removed by washing with 20 mM CHAPS in 20 mM NaPi. Then the proteins were released with high salt (500 mM NaCl, 20 mM CHAPS, and 50 mM NaPi), reconstituted, and assayed for transport activity (see below).Radiation Inactivation AnalysisSamples of rat cerebral cortex (0.2-0.35 g) from male Wistar rats (180 g) were kept at −20°C and exposed to high-energy electrons using the 10 MeV linear accelerator at Risø, Denmark. The dose of radiation was determined using calibrated thermodosimeters (water). The samples were frozen (−10°C) during radiation which was delivered in runs of 0.5-2 Mrad. Between runs the samples were cooled to −15°C for at least 2 min to ensure that they remained completely frozen during the entire irradiation process. The total doses were from 0 to 20 Mrad. After radiation, the tissue was kept at −80°C until it was used. This irradiation procedure and the equipment have been calibrated by radiation inactivation of seven enzymes of known molecular masses (67-148 kDa) which gave a calibration constant of 730,000 Da × Mrad (40Nielsen M.

Experience from the last 10 years shows that the interexperimental variation in the radiation effect is negligible and that extensive calibration is not required in every experiment. However, to verify the validity of the calibration, the binding of [3H]flunitrazepam and [3H]RO 15-1788 to benzodiazepine receptors and the activity of pyruvate kinase were determined. The irradiated samples were homogenized in buffer (50 mM Tris acetate, pH 7.4, 5 mM EDTA, and 1 mM PMSF) and centrifuged (39,000 × g, 18,000 rpm, 20 min, 4°C). The supernatants were assayed for pyruvate kinase activity using the Boehringer Mannheim test kit 126047. The pellets were either used for determination of benzodiazepine binding as described (41Nielsen M. Honoré T. Braestrup C. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1985; 34: 3633-3642Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) or mixed with 12 volumes of solubilization buffer (32 mM cholate, 500 mM NaCl, 5 mM EDTA, 100 mM NaPi, pH 7.4), incubated (10 min) on ice, and centrifuged as above. The supernatants were immediately frozen (−80°C) in portions of 300 µl and thawed immediately prior to reconstitution (see below).Reconstitution of Glutamate Transporters in LiposomesThis was done as described (11Trotti D.

Briefly, the uptake reaction was started by diluting 20 µl of proteoliposomes into saline with tritiated amino acid and valinomycin. The reaction was terminated by dilution and filtration. The kinetic data were analyzed with the direct linear plot method (43Eisenthal R. Cornish-Bowden A. Biochem.

The electrophoresis trays had heat exchangers with cooling water kept at 0-5°C. After electrophoresis the proteins were either silver-stained (34Danbolt N.C. Pines G. Kanner B.I. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 6734-6740Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar) or electroblotted onto nitrocellulose membranes (15Lehre K.P. Levy L.M. Ottersen O.P. Storm-Mathisen J. Danbolt N.C. J.

INTRODUCTIONThe majority of excitatory signals in the mammalian central nervous system may be transmitted by glutamate (1Fonnum F. J. Neurochem. 1984; 42: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (1670) Google Scholar). The extracellular glutamate concentration has to be kept low, both to secure a high signal-to-noise (background) ratio and because excessive glutamate receptor activation can lead to neuronal damage (2Olney J.W. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1990; 30: 47-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar). This is achieved by the action of sodium-dependent glutamate transporters located in the plasma membranes of both glial cells and neurons (3Danbolt N.C. Prog. Neurobiol. (New York). 1994; 44: 377-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar).

Thus, the functions of these carriers may be more refined than simple removal of excitatory amino acids.It is legitimate to ask whether the glutamate transporters might form oligomeric complexes. Several glutamate transporter subtypes exist (see above). These proteins have been reported to aggregate (21Danbolt N.C. Storm-Mathisen J. Kanner B.I.

Neurosci. 1995; 15: 1835-1853Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Recent reports conclude that some other co-transporters may exist in vivo as oligomers (24Béliveau R. Demeule M. Ibnoul-Khatib H.

Several neurotransmitter receptors, including ionotropic glutamate receptors, operate as hetero-oligomeric complexes (30McBain C.J. Mayer M.L. Physiol.

Furthermore, we demonstrate that GLT and GLAST, as well as the neuronal glutamate transporter EAAC, form oligomeric complexes but that GLT and GLAST do not complex with each other. Evidence suggests that oligomeric structure is required for transport activity."

We have previously shown that thrombin activates p38 kinase, a recently discovered new member of the mitogen-activated protein kinase family (Kramer, R. M., Roberts, E. F., Strifler, B. A., and Johnstone, E. M. (1995) J. Biol. Chem. 270, 27395-27398) and also induces phosphorylation of cPLA2, thereby increasing its intrinsic catalytic activity. In the present study we have examined the role of p38 kinase in the phosphorylation and activation of cPLA2 in stimulated platelets. We have observed that activation of p38 kinase accompanies receptor-mediated events in platelets and coincides with cPLA2 phosphorylation. Furthermore, in the presence of inhibitors of p38 kinase, the proline-directed phosphorylation of cPLA2 was completely blocked in platelets stimulated with the thrombin receptor agonist peptide SFLLRN and was suppressed during the early (up to 2 min) phase of platelet stimulation caused by thrombin. Unexpectedly, we found that prevention of proline-directed phosphorylation of cPLA2 in stimulated platelets did not attenuate its ability to release arachidonic acid from platelet phospholipids. We conclude that: 1) cPLA2 is a physiological target of p38 kinase; 2) p38 kinase is involved in the early phosphorylation of cPLA2 in stimulated platelets; and 3) proline-directed phosphorylation of cPLA2 is not required for its receptor-mediated activation.

On activation of platelets with physiological agonists such as thrombin, significant amounts of arachidonic acid are rapidly liberated for transformation to thromboxane A2 via the cyclooxygenase-thromboxane synthase pathway. There is substantial evidence to indicate that this efficient receptor-mediated mobilization of arachidonic acid is mediated by a phospholipase A2 pathway (1Purdon A.D. Patelunas D. Smith J.B.

Many studies with different cellular systems, including platelets, have documented that phosphorylation of cPLA2 by receptor-mediated events accompanies the stimulated release of arachidonic acid from cellular phospholipids (5Kramer, R. M., Liscovitch, M., (eds) (1994) Signal-activated Phospholipases, pp. 13–30, R. G. Landes Co., Austin, TX.Google Scholar). Lin et al. (6Lin L.-L. Wartman M. Lin A.Y. Knopf J.L. Seth A. Davis R.J. Cell. 1993; 72: 269-278Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1659) Google Scholar) established that this phosphorylation is “activating” (i.e. it increases the catalytic activity of cPLA2 severalfold) and occurs at Ser505 residing within a MAP kinase consensus sequence (Pro-Leu-Ser505-Pro). In fact, cPLA2 was phosphorylated and activated by the MAP kinase ERK2 in vitro and in vivo (i.e. in cultured cells overexpressing cPLA2 and ERK2; 6Lin L.-L. Wartman M. Lin A.Y. Knopf J.L. Seth A. Davis R.J. Cell. 1993; 72: 269-278Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1659) Google Scholar), and accordingly, the ERKs were taken to be responsible for the proline-directed phosphorylation of cPLA2 observed in various cellular systems. Surprisingly, we have noted that phosphorylation of cPLA2 occurred in the absence of ERK activation in human platelets stimulated with the thrombin receptor agonist peptide SFLLRN (7Kramer R.M.

Furthermore, under conditions in which ERK activation was completely suppressed by protein kinase C inhibitors, cPLA2 phosphorylation induced by thrombin or collagen was unaffected (8Brsch-Haubold A.G. Kramer R.M. Watson S.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25885-25892Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Last, PD 098059, a specific inhibitor of the activation of ERKs, did not block thrombin-induced cPLA2 phosphorylation (9Brsch-Haubold A.G. Kramer R.M. Watson S.P. Biochem. J. 1996; 318: 207-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Taken together, these findings suggested that kinases other than the ERKs may be involved in receptor-mediated phosphorylation of cPLA2. We have recently shown that in addition to the ERKs, platelets contain p38 kinase (10Kramer R.M. Roberts E.F. Strifler B.A. Johnstone E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27395-27398Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar), a recently discovered MAP kinase typically activated by inflammatory cytokines and environmental stress. On the other hand, we were unable to detect kinases belonging to the Jun nuclear kinase subfamily of the stress-activated MAP kinases (11Cobb M.H. Goldsmith E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14843-14846Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1663) Google Scholar). Thrombin induces a rapid and robust activation of p38, suggesting that this kinase may play a role in platelet function (10Kramer R.M. Roberts E.F. Strifler B.A. Johnstone E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27395-27398Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). It was recently reported that p38 kinase provides a signal crucial for platelet aggregation at low agonist concentrations (12Saklatvala J. Rawlinson L. Waller R.J. Sarsfield S. Lee J.C. Morton L.F. Barnes M.J. Farndale R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6586-6589Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). The present study was undertaken to further elucidate the functional role of p38 in cPLA2 activation. Using inhibitors of p38 kinase we found that cPLA2 is a physiological target of p38 kinase in platelets stimulated via the thrombin receptor. Our results further indicate that prevention of cPLA2 phosphorylation by such p38 kinase inhibitors does not attenuate the receptor-mediated liberation of arachidonic acid, suggesting that proline-directed phosphorylation of cPLA2 is not a prerequisite for its activation in stimulated platelets. Thrombin and collagen were obtained from Enzyme Research Laboratories and Hormon-Chemie (Munich, Germany), respectively. Calcium ionophore A23187, phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate, prostaglandin E1, and U46619 were from Sigma. 4-(4-Fluorophenyl)-2-(4-methylsulfinylphenyl)-5-(4-pyridyl)1H-imidazole (SB 203580) and 4-(4-fluorophenyl)-2-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-5(4-pyridyl)-1H-imidazole (SB 202190) were synthesized at Lilly Research Laboratories following the procedure described by Adams et al. (13Adams J.L. Gallagher T.F. White J.R. International Patent Application WO. 1993; : 93-14081Google Scholar). Specifically, SB 203580 was prepared by condensing 4-(methylthio)-benzaldehyde with 4-fluoro-2-hydroxyimino-2-(4-pyridyl)acetophenone in the presence of ammonium acetate, which provided 4-(4-fluorophenyl)-N-1-hydroxy-2-(4-methylthiophenyl)-5-(4-pyridyl)imidazole. Reduction of this intermediate with triethyl phosphite followed by oxidation of the sulfur with K2S2O8 provided SB 203580, which was purified by column chromatography and recrystallization. SB 202190 was prepared in a like manner starting from 4-fluoro-2-hydroxyimino-2-(4-pyridyl)acetophenone and 4-hydroxybenzaldehyde. Methylarachidonyl fluorophosphonate (MAFP) was from Cayman, and 3-(3-acetamide-1-benzyl-2-ethylindolyl-5-oxy)propane phosphonic acid (LY311727) was kindly provided by Sue Draheim (Lilly Research Laboratories). Blood from healthy volunteers that had taken regular aspirin (325 mg) the day before and on the morning of the phlebotomy was drawn into 0.16 volume acid-citrate-dextrose (85 mM trisodium citrate, 64 mM citric acid, 111 mM glucose, and 3 μM prostaglandin E1). Platelets were isolated as described previously (14Kramer R.M. Roberts E.F. Manetta J.V. Hyslop P.A. Jakubowski J.A. J. Biol.

After addition of CaCl2 and the GPIIb-IIIa antagonist cyclo(S,S)-Mpr(Har)GDWPPen-NH2 (kindly provided by Dr. Robert Scarborough, COR Therapeutics) to final concentrations of 1.1 mM and 30 μM, respectively, platelet suspensions (final concentration, 1 × 109/ml or as indicated) were preincubated with inhibitors or vehicle (≤1% Me2SO final concentration) at 37°C as indicated. Platelets were then incubated at 37°C with α-thrombin (∼3500 NIH units/mg), SFLLRN (C-terminal amide) synthesized as detailed before (15Hui K.Y. Jakubowski J.A. Wyss V.L. Angleton E.L. Biochem.

The reaction was stopped by adding (final concentrations) 1% Triton X-100, 5 mM EGTA, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 0.2 mM Na3VO4, 0.1 μM microcystin, 5 mM sodium pyrophosphate, 25 mM sodium fluoride, 100 μM leupeptin, 0.2 mg/ml aprotinin, 1 mM Pefabloc (Centerchem), and 50 mMβ-glycerophosphate, pH 7.5, followed by SDS-PAGE sample buffer (7Kramer R.M.

For cPLA2 assays in platelet lysates, incubations were terminated, and platelet sonicates were prepared as detailed previously (14Kramer R.M. Roberts E.F. Manetta J.V. Hyslop P.A. Jakubowski J.A. J.

To measure thrombin-induced incorporation of phosphate into cPLA2, washed platelets were prelabeled with 0.5 mCi/ml [32P]orthophosphate for 2 h and stimulated with thrombin, and cPLA2 was immunoprecipitated with anti-cPLA2 antiserum as detailed previously (8Brsch-Haubold A.G.

Immunoprecipitates were subjected to SDS-PAGE and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes, and 32P-labeled cPLA2 was visualized by autoradiography. Platelet-rich plasma (40 ml) was prepared as above and incubated for 1 h at 37°C with 20 μCi of [5,6,8,9,11,12,14,15-3H]arachidonic acid (∼60 Ci/mmol; DuPont NEN) added in 2 ml of 5 mM Tris/HCl, pH 8, bound to fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin (100 mg/ml). Free [3H]arachidonic acid was removed by washing platelets as detailed above. The incorporation of [3H]arachidonic acid into platelet phospholipids was ∼35%, and the content of esterified [3H]arachidonic acid was approximately 2 × 105 dpm/108 platelets. [3H]Arachidonic acid-labeled platelets (0.5 × 109/ml) were preincubated with inhibitors and subsequently stimulated with thrombin or SFLLRN as described above. Reactions were stopped by adding 2 ml of Dole's reagent (2-propanol/heptane/0.5 M sulfuric acid, 40:10:1, containing 10 μg/ml stearic acid), and the released [3H]arachidonic acid and 12-lipoxygenase metabolites were extracted and quantified as described (7Kramer R.M.

Solubilized samples were subjected to electrophoresis according to Laemmli (16Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar) using the NOVEX system with 10% Tris/glycine gels at 35 mA for 3.5 h (for detection of cPLA2 gel shift) or at 30 mA for 2 h (for MAP kinase detection) and Rainbow Markers (range, 14.3-200 kDa; Amersham Corp.) as protein standards. Proteins were electroblotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes using as blotting buffer 10 mM CAPS, pH 11.0, containing 0.01% SDS and 1% methanol. The membranes were incubated as follows: 1 h at room temperature in TBST (137 mM NaCl, 2.6 mM KCl, 0.1% Tween 20, 25 mM Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, containing 0.2% I-Block (Tropix)), followed by 1 h with primary antibody (i.e. anti-cPLA2 IgG prepared as described (14Kramer R.M.

For immunoblotting with antiphosphotyrosine antibodies we used bovine serum albumin (0.75%) instead of I-Block. The blots were developed using the ECL detection system (Amersham). Since MAFP targets the active site serine of cPLA2, we examined its effect on thrombin, a serine protease, using a thrombin-fibrinogen clotting assay (17Lundblad R.L. Kingdon H.S. Mann K.G. Methods Enzymol. 1976; 45: 156-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). We found that in this assay 50 μM MAFP increased the clotting time only minimally (i.e. 1.3-fold). By comparison, PPACK, a potent serine-directed active site inhibitor of thrombin, increased the clotting time by greater than 25-fold. Thromboxane A2 production was determined by radioimmunoassay using nonaspirinized, gel-filtered human platelets as described previously (18Jakubowski J.A. Stampfer M.J. Vaillancourt R. Deykin D. Br. J. Haematol. 1985; 60: 635-642Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). PLA2 activity was assayed as described previously (14Kramer R.M. Roberts E.F. Manetta J.V. Hyslop P.A. Jakubowski J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26796-26804Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We previously determined the kinase activity of the different platelet MAP kinases resolved by MonoQ chromatography and observed that thrombin-induced stimulation of p38 kinase is more rapid and more potent than that of ERK1 and −2 (10Kramer R.M. Roberts E.F. Strifler B.A. Johnstone E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27395-27398Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Due to the small shift in electrophoretic mobility and high reactivity with antiphosphotyrosine antibodies, activated p38 can be readily detected in platelet extracts despite its molecular mass being almost the same as that of ERK2 (41.3 versus 41.4 kDa, respectively). Thus, as shown in Fig. 1, p38 kinase activated by thrombin displays only a small decrease in electrophoretic mobility compared with activated ERK2 (and ERK1) (lanes 4-6 versus 10-12). However, activated p38 can be readily visualized by antiphosphotyrosine antibodies (lanes 2 and 3), whereas activated ERKs due to comigration with the very abundant actin at 45 kDa react only poorly (lane 3 versus lane 12). To probe the role of p38 kinase in cPLA2 activation, we first examined the stimulation of p38 kinase by platelet receptor agonists and reagents that are known to induce cPLA2 phosphorylation. For comparison, we also monitored activation of the ERK kinases. Collagen-induced platelet activation is dependent on the integrin α2β1 complex (19Kehrel B. Platelets (Edinb.). 1995; 6: 11-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), and we determined its effect on activation of p38 in aspirinized platelets using a concentration of collagen that caused phosphorylation of cPLA2 and promoted significant mobilization of arachidonic acid (results not shown). As shown in Fig. 2, collagen induced a robust activation of p38 without stimulating the ERKs. In contrast, the thromboxane A2-mimetic U46619 activating the platelet thromboxane A2 receptor (20Best L.C. McGuire M.B. Martin T.J. Preston F.E. Russell R.G.G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1979; 583: 344-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) caused a weak activation of both p38 kinase and the ERKs. As further demonstrated in Fig. 2, the Ca2+ ionophore A23187 solely stimulated p38 kinase, and conversely, the protein kinase C activator phorbol-dibutyrate activated only the ERK kinases. Collectively, these results show that p38 kinase is activated by all receptor agonists tested and some, but not all, agents that selectively target intracellular signaling events (i.e. cytosolic free [Ca2+] or protein kinase C). To examine the temporal relationship between receptor-mediated activation of p38 kinase and cPLA2 phosphorylation, we stimulated platelets with thrombin and the thrombin receptor agonist peptide SFLLRN for 0-5 min. As shown in Fig. 3, in platelets exposed to thrombin, activation of p38 MAP kinase preceded the time-dependent decrease in the electrophoretic mobility of cPLA2 characteristic of its phosphorylation on Ser505. By comparison, the stimulation of the ERKs was delayed relative to the appearance of phosphorylated cPLA2. Fig. 3 further demonstrates that SFLLRN induced less pronounced activation of p38 and failed to activate the ERKs but nonetheless caused phosphorylation of cPLA2. Taken together, the above results show that activation of p38 kinase is common to receptor-mediated events in platelets and that the profile of cPLA2 phosphorylation follows that of p38 activation, suggesting that receptor-induced phosphorylation of cPLA2 may be caused by p38 kinase.Fig. 3Time course of thrombin- and SFLLRN-mediated activation of p38 kinase and cPLA2. Platelets at 1 × 109/ml were incubated with thrombin (10 units/ml) or SFLLRN (100 μM) as described under “Experimental Procedures.” After addition of Triton X-100 stopping mixture and SDS sample buffer, solubilized extracts were subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting, probing with the antibodies described in the legend of Fig. 1 and anti-cPLA2 IgG. The data shown are representative of two independent experiments yielding similar results. anti-PY, antiphosphorotyrosine.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To examine whether cPLA2 is the physiological substrate of p38 kinase in stimulated platelets, we exploited the fact that Lee and Young (21Lee J.C. Young P.R. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1996; 59: 152-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar) have recently described pyridinyl imidazoles that are potent and specific inhibitors of p38 kinase. We synthesized two compounds, SB 202190 and SB 203580, and found that they potently inhibit platelet p38 kinase in vitro (IC50, 8 and 40 nM, respectively; Fig. 4A). We noted that although SB 202190 is the more potent compound, it is less soluble than SB 203580 at concentrations greater than 10 μM. To directly probe the involvement of p38 in the phosphorylation of cPLA2 in stimulated platelets, we preincubated platelets for 5 min with increasing concentrations of the p38 inhibitors and looked for an effect on thrombin-induced phosphorylation of cPLA2. As shown in Fig. 4B, both SB 202190 and SB 203580 suppressed the thrombin-induced shift in electrophoretic mobility of cPLA2, indicative of the proline-directed phosphorylation, in a dose-dependent fashion. We then studied the time dependence of the inhibition of cPLA2 phosphorylation by 10 μM SB 202190 in platelets that were stimulated for 0-5 min with a high dose of either thrombin or SFLLRN. As demonstrated in Fig. 5, in SFLLRN-stimulated platelets, cPLA2 phosphorylation was completely suppressed in the presence of the p38 inhibitor. Likewise, thrombin-mediated phosphorylation of cPLA2 was inhibited after 1 min of stimulation and attenuated after 2 min compared with control incubations with vehicle. After 5 min of stimulation with thrombin, however, cPLA2 became phosphorylated in platelets despite the presence of the p38 inhibitor. These results provide the first direct evidence that p38 kinase is responsible for cPLA2 phosphorylation in SFLLRN-stimulated platelets and is involved in the early phosphorylation of cPLA2 in thrombin-stimulated platelets. To further analyze the two temporal phases of cPLA2 phosphorylation, we examined the effect of p38 inhibition on thrombin-mediated cPLA2 phosphorylation after preincubation of platelets with 30 μM SB 203580 followed by stimulation for 2 or 5 min with increasing concentrations of thrombin. As shown in Fig. 6, after 2 min of thrombin treatment, as expected, the phosphorylation of cPLA2 was completely suppressed in the presence of SB 203580. In contrast, following the 5-min stimulation, cPLA2 phosphorylation was prevented by the p38 inhibitor at low doses of thrombin but only partially suppressed at higher doses. Altogether these results are consistent with the notion that proline-directed phosphorylation of cPLA2 is initially mediated by p38 kinase and may subsequently occur via p38 kinase-independent mechanisms. However, we noted that under conditions in which the gel shift is completely prevented by p38 inhibitors (i.e. stimulation for 2 min), the enhancement of cPLA2 activity in lysates from platelets stimulated with thrombin or SFLLRN is suppressed by only 50% (Table I). Likewise, thrombin-induced phosphorylation of cPLA2 monitored by 32P incorporation is only partially blocked. Thus, as demonstrated in Fig. 7, after preincubation of 32P-labeled platelets with SB 203580 and exposure to thrombin for 2 min, the 32P labeling of cPLA2 was reduced to 50% of the control. Collectively, these results suggest that a kinase that phosphorylates cPLA2 at a site distinct from Ser505 and therefore does not induce a gel shift of cPLA2 also participates in the early receptor-mediated phosphorylation and activation of cPLA2.Fig. 5Time course of inhibition of cPLA2 phosphorylation by p38 inhibitors.

The reaction was stopped, and cPLA2 was immunoprecipitated and subjected to SDS-PAGE and autoradiography as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Phosphorylation quantified by densitometric analysis was in the presence of thrombin (+THR: −SB 203580, 100%; +SB 203580, 52%) and in the absence of thrombin (−THR: −SB 203580, 0%; +SB 203580, below basal levels). An equal amount of cPLA2 was immunoprecipitated in each sample, as verified by immunoblotting analysis (not shown).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) As shown above, preincubation with p38 inhibitors resulted in complete inhibition of proline-directed phosphorylation of cPLA2 in platelets exposed to thrombin up to 2 min or SFLLRN up to 5 min. We therefore questioned whether suppression of this cPLA2 phosphorylation may affect its ability to hydrolyze platelet phospholipids in response to these agonists. Aspirinized platelets were prelabeled with [3H]arachidonic acid, incubated with and without p38 inhibitor, and then exposed to either SFLLRN or thrombin. The released arachidonic acid was then measured as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Unexpectedly, as shown with a dose dependence study for thrombin (Fig. 8A) and a time course experiment for thrombin (Fig. 8B) and SFLLRN (Fig. 8C), the stimulus-induced arachidonic acid mobilization was not affected at any dose or time in the presence of p38 inhibitors. Importantly, as depicted in Fig. 9, the thrombin- and SFLLRN-mediated liberation of arachidonic acid was effectively inhibited by MAFP, a recently described irreversible inhibitor of cPLA2 (22Huang Z.

https://openalex.org/W2047637160,"There are two genes, fabA and fabZ, encoding β-hydroxyacyl-acyl carrier protein (ACP) dehydratases that function in the dissociated, type II fatty acid synthase system of Escherichia coli. We have investigated their roles in fatty acid synthesis by purifying the two proteins and reconstituting cycles of fatty acid synthesis in vitro using five other purified proteins. FabA and FabZ exhibited broad, overlapping chain length specificities. The FabZ dehydratase efficiently catalyzed the dehydration of short chain β-hydroxyacyl-ACPs and long chain saturated and unsaturated β-hydroxyacyl-ACPs. FabA was most active on intermediate chain length β-hydroxyacyl-ACPs and also possessed significant activity toward both short and long chain saturated β-hydroxyacyl-ACPs. Significantly, FabA was virtually inactive in the dehydration of long chain unsaturated β-hydroxyacyl-ACP. The introduction of the double bond at the 10-carbon stage of fatty acid synthesis by FabA was only detected in the presence of β-ketoacyl-ACP synthase I (FabB). A yeast two-hybrid analysis failed to detect an interaction between FabA and FabB, therefore the channeling of intermediates toward unsaturated fatty acid synthesis by FabB was attributed to the affinity of the condensing enzyme for cis-decenoyl-ACP. The broad substrate specificity of FabZ coupled with the inactivity of FabA toward a long chain unsaturated β-hydroxyacyl-ACP provides a biochemical explanation for the phenotypes of cells with genetically altered levels of the two dehydratases."

It is believed that some cases of organ-specific toxicity associated with these agents result from damage to mitochondrial DNA (17Singh G. Sharkey S.H. Moorehead R. Pharmacol. Ther. 1992; 54: 217-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Although DNA repair of the nuclear genome of eukaryotes has been extensively studied (18Friedberg E.C. Walker G.C. Siede W. DNA Repair and Mutagenesis. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D. C.1995Google Scholar), much less is known about DNA repair in mitochondria. Attempts to measure nucleotide excision repair in mitochondria failed to detect activity (19Clayton D.A. Doda J.N. Friedberg E.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1974; 7: 2777-2781Crossref Scopus (413) Google Scholar). Furthermore, mitochondrial DNA mutates at rates greater than does nuclear DNA (20Wallace D.C. Ye J.H. Neckelmann S.N. Singh G. Webster K.A. Greenberg B.D. Curr. Genet. 1995; 12: 81-90Crossref Scopus (200) Google Scholar). These observations have prompted speculation that mammalian mitochondria lack DNA repair (1Clayton D.A. Cell. 1982; 28: 693-705Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (913) Google Scholar, 13Miquel J. Mutat. Res. 1992; 275: 209-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Recently, however, a number of reports have concluded that mammalian mitochondria possess base excision repair activity (21Pettepher C.C. LeDoux S.P. Bohr V.A. Wilson G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 3113-3117Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22LeDoux S.P. Patton N.J. Avery L.J. Wilson G.L.

Similar studies have shown that mitochondria can repair DNA inter-strand cross-links caused by cisplatin (24LeDoux S.P. Wilson G.L. Beecham E.J. Stevnsner T. Wassermann K. Bohr V.A. Carcinogenesis. 1992; 13: 1967-1973Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar), as well as DNA damage caused by bleomycin (25Shen C.C. Wertelecki W. Driggers W.J. LeDoux S.P. Wilson G.L. Mutat.

Chem. 1993; 268: 22042-22045Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These results suggest that while mammalian mitochondria lack nucleotide excision repair activity, they are likely to possess a number of distinct DNA repair pathways. The idea that one of these mammalian mitochondrial repair pathways may involve homologous DNA recombination (HR) 1The abbreviations used are: HRhomologous DNA recombinationWTwild-typeneoneomycin phosphotransferaseDSBRdouble-strand break repairSSAsingle-strand annealingATPγSadenosine 5′-O-(3-thiotriphosphate)AMP-PNP5′-adenylylimidodiphosphate. is plausible for several reasons. First, as mentioned above, cisplatin inter-strand DNA cross-links are repaired within the mammalian mitochondria (24LeDoux S.P. Wilson G.L. Beecham E.J. Stevnsner T. Wassermann K. Bohr V.A. Carcinogenesis. 1992; 13: 1967-1973Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). While the reaction mechanism by which these cross-links are repaired in mammalian mitochondria is unknown, in both prokaryotes, and in yeast nuclei, repair of these DNA lesions is accomplished via homologous recombination (27Sinden R.R.

Anticancer Res. 1994; 14: 1807-1810PubMed Google Scholar). Second, a number of nuclear-encoded yeast genes have been shown to be involved in mitochondrial recombination and repair (31Foury F. Lahaye A. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 1441-1449Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 32Ling F. Makishima F. Morishima M.N. Shibata T. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4090-4101Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Finally, studies of DNA repair in plant chloroplasts have shown that a homolog of the bacterial recA gene is involved in DNA repair in that organelle (33Cerutti H. Osman M. Grandoni P. Jagendorf A.T.

We set out to test the hypothesis that recombinational DNA repair occurs within the mammalian mitochondria. Due to the unavailability of mammalian mitochondrial transformation protocols, a biochemical approach was pursued (37Symington L.S. Fogarty L.M. Kolodner R. Cell. 1983; 35: 805-813Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 38Kucherlapati R.S. Spencer J. Moore P.D. Mol. Cell.

Biol. 1991; 11: 445-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Subcellular fractions highly enriched in mitochondria were isolated and protein extracts from this material shown to catalyze cell-free HR. The majority of recombinant clones analyzed are the products of a conservative recombination reaction, strongly suggesting that authentic strand-transferase activity, rather than a nonspecific nuclease-mediated process is responsible for their creation. This hypothesis is supported by the observation that pretreatment of extracts with affinity-purified anti-recA antibody reduced homologous recombination activity by approximately 90%. These data indicate that mitochondria possess the enzymatic machinery needed to catalyze HR, and suggest that recombinational DNA repair may occur within the mitochondria of mammalian cells. HT1080 cells (derived from a spontaneous human fibrosarcoma) were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Rockville, MD). Human dermal fibroblasts, obtained from a punch biopsy of a normal individual (wild-type, WT), and from an individual afflicted with pyruvate dehydrogenase deficiency, were kindly provided by Dr. Robert O'Dea (University of Minnesota). The substrate molecules pSV2neoDL (Fig. 1C) and pSV2neoDR (Fig. 1D) have been described (38Kucherlapati R.S. Spencer J. Moore P.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1985; 5: 714-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Both plasmids harbor a functional ampicillin-resistance gene, and a non-functional neomycin phosphotransferase (neo) gene. The inactivating mutations in pSV2neoDL and pSV2neoDR are non-overlapping deletions (of 248 and 283 base pairs, respectively) within the coding region of the neo gene. These alleles do not spontaneously revert, and generation of a functional neo gene is dependent on inter-plasmid recombination (38Kucherlapati R.S. Spencer J. Moore P.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1985; 5: 714-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The single-stranded circular molecule ssneoDR (42Rauth S. Song K.-Y. Ayares D. Wallace L. Moore P.D. Kucherlapati R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 5587-5591Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) harbors the neo gene from pSV2neoDR inserted into the multiple cloning site of M13mp18 (Fig. 1A). Crude mitochondria preparations were prepared from livers removed from Fisher 344 female rats, or from cultured cells, as described (43Darley-Usmar V.M. Rickwood D. Wilson M.T. Mitochondria: A Practical Approach. IRL Press, Washington, D. C.1987Google Scholar). This material was further purified by centrifugation through a Percoll gradient (44Blume H. Arch. Pharm. (Weinheim). 1979; 312: 561-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Purified mitochondria were lysed by hypo-osmotic shock, and the membrane fraction removed by centrifugation for 30 min at 70,000 rpm in a Beckman TL100/3 rotor. Protein concentration was determined using the Bradford assay (45Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (211983) Google Scholar). Nuclear protein extracts were prepared as outlined by Jessberger and Berg (41Jessberger R. Berg P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 445-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). DNA recombination substrates (500 ng of each substrate) were incubated with protein extracts for 30 min using buffer conditions previously described (41Jessberger R. Berg P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 445-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), unless otherwise indicated. Briefly, the DNA substrates were incubated with 5 µg of mitochondrial protein extract in a buffer containing 60 mM sodium chloride, 2 mM 2-mercaptoethanol, 2 mM potassium chloride, 12 mM Tris hydrochloride (pH 7.4), 1 mM ATP, 0.1 mM each deoxynucleoside triphosphate (dNTP), 2.5 mM spermidine, 2% glycerol, and 0.2 mM dithiothreitol in a reaction volume of 50 µl. At the conclusion of the incubation period, this material was extracted with phenol:chloroform (1:1), ethanol precipitated, resuspended in water, and used to transform DH10B Escherichia coli via electroporation (Cell-Porator, Life Technologies, Inc.). The transformed bacteria were then plated onto LB-agar plates containing either ampicillin, or kanamycin and ampicillin. Since both pSV2neoDL and pSV2neoDR contain a functional ampicillin-resistance gene, the number of ampicillin-resistant colonies served as a plasmid recovery/transformation control. (Note that in experiments using ssneoDR and pSV2neoDL, only the latter molecule contained an ampicillin-resistance gene. Nevertheless, the number of ampicillin-resistant colonies serves as an effective plasmid recovery/transformation control in these experiments as well.) The total number of kanamycin-resistant and ampicillin-resistant colonies was calculated and the ratio of these values used to calculate the homologous recombination frequency. In parallel experiments, the recombination substrates were separately incubated with mitochondrial protein extracts, as above, and pooled prior to bacterial transformation. The recombination frequency obtained from these latter experiments (calculated as above) was subtracted from that obtained in the co-incubation experiments to obtain a corrected HR frequency value. When no kanamycin-resistant colonies were observed in these control experiments, the background HR frequency was presented as less than that calculated had one kanamycin-resistant colony been recovered. With the exception of those experiments involving the use of two double-stranded linearized plasmid molecules, the “background” HR frequency was always at least 10-fold lower than that obtained when the DNA substrates were co-incubated with mitochondrial extracts. An exception was seen in the case when pSV2neoDL and pSV2neoDR, which had both been linearized with SalI, were used. Under these conditions, the background HR frequency was essentially equivalent to that seen when the two plasmids were co-incubated with mitochondrial extracts. As discussed below, it is likely that the recombination mechanism involved in the formation of recombinant plasmids when this particular substrate combination is used is distinct from the pathway that occurs when at least one of the substrates is circular (see Fig. 3, and tbl II).Table II.Analysis of recombinant plasmid DNA moleculesOne plasmidTwo plasmidsMonomerDimer(WT + DL)(WT + DR)(WT + DD)WTWT/DLWT/DRWT/DDn an indicates the number of individual plasmids of each type recovered, while & indicates the percentage of the total represented by each type.104402993%(17)(7)(7)(0)(49)(15)(5)a n indicates the number of individual plasmids of each type recovered, while & indicates the percentage of the total represented by each type. Open table in a new tab Kanamycin-resistant bacterial colonies were picked with a sterile toothpick and grown overnight at 37°C in non-selective media. Plasmid DNA was isolated, and subjected to restriction endonuclease digestion and gel electrophoresis using standard methods (46Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, New York1989Google Scholar). Cytochrome-c oxidase activity was measured in a Gilford Response spectrophotometer as described previously (47Smith L. Glick D. Methods of Biochemical Analysis. Interscience Publishers, New York1955: 427-634Google Scholar). Nucleosides and analogs, aphidicolin, and all other chemicals used were obtained from Sigma. Restriction enzymes were from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA). In contrast to yeast and plants (48Howe C.J. Trends Genet. 1988; 4: 150-152Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar), introduction of genetic material into the mitochondria of mammalian cells has not been described. Therefore, in order to measure HR in mammalian mitochondria, a direct, biochemical approach was utilized. This strategy has been used previously to show that crude nuclear extracts (37Symington L.S. Fogarty L.M. Kolodner R. Cell. 1983; 35: 805-813Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 38Kucherlapati R.S. Spencer J. Moore P.D. Mol. Cell.

Chem. 1993; 268: 15070-15079Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) from mammalian cells catalyze HR. In brief, this assay is based upon the following observations. Co-incubation of two DNA substrates that separately encode defective heteroalleles of a selectable marker with a protein extract followed by transformation of this material into recombination-deficient E. coli results in the generation of resistant bacterial colonies. These colonies harbor recombinant molecules encoding a functional marker gene. In some of the experiments described in this report, we have used two covalently closed circular double-stranded molecules, pSV2neoDL, and pSV2neoDR, while in other experiments, the pSV2neoDL molecule, which had been linearized with the restriction enzyme SalI (which cuts within the neomycin phosphotransferase gene, see Fig. 1B) was co-incubated with the single-stranded circular molecule ssneoDR (see Fig. 1A). In all cases, the HR frequency was determined by measuring the ratio of homologous recombinant molecules (kanamycin-resistant) to non-recombinant molecules (ampicillin-resistant) as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Crude mitochondria were purified from rat liver (43Darley-Usmar V.M. Rickwood D. Wilson M.T. Mitochondria: A Practical Approach. IRL Press, Washington, D. C.1987Google Scholar), and centrifuged through a Percoll gradient as described (44Blume H. Arch. Pharm. (Weinheim). 1979; 312: 561-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Four fractions (numbered 1 to 4 from the top of the gradient to the bottom of the gradient) were isolated from the Percoll gradient and processed as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The soluble fraction was characterized with respect to HR activity and the membrane pellet was tested for cytochrome-c oxidase activity, a mitochondrial marker enzyme. Specific activity values obtained from the analysis of the four fractions were normalized with respect to the peak fraction (Fraction 3). The data from these experiments (Fig. 2) demonstrate that HR activity is specifically enriched in the highly purified mitochondrial fraction. The specific HR activity in this fraction was greater than that of crude mitochondria (data not shown). The analyses described above were performed using linear, double-stranded pSV2neoDL and circular, single-stranded ssneoDR as HR substrates. We also tested a number of independently prepared rat liver mitochondrial extracts for HR activity using the double-stranded circular plasmid substrates pSV2neoDR (Fig. 1D) and pSV2neoDL (Fig. 1C). These results, shown in Table I, indicate that the mitochondrial extracts are capable of recombining these substrates as well. The HR frequencies observed with the latter set of recombination substrates are about 100-fold lower than those seen with the former. This is because far fewer ampicillin-resistant colonies are obtained when one of the substrates (ssneoDR) lacks an ampicillin gene, while the other (pSV2neoDL) has been linearized, thereby reducing its ability to transform E. coli. A similar observation was made previously when these two sets of recombination substrates were used to measure HR frequency in nuclear protein extracts prepared from immortalized mammalian cells (49Jessberger R. Podust V. Hubscher U. Berg P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15070-15079Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).Table I.Rat liver mitochondrial extracts carry out HR using different recombination substrateRat liver mitochondria preparation numberHR frequency (backgroundaHR frequency is expressed as the number of kanamycin-resistant colonies obtained per 105 ampicillin-resistant colonies.

Open table in a new tab As these results indicate, mitochondrial extracts can catalyze HR between either of these two sets of plasmid DNA substrates. In both cases, the HR frequency observed in control experiments in which the DNA substrates were separately incubated with the mitochondrial extracts (see “Experimental Procedures” for details) was at least 10-fold lower than those seen when the substrates are co-incubated with mitochondrial extracts (Table I). We conclude that the use of either set of substrates is a satisfactory method by which to measure mitochondrial HR activity. The possibility that mitochondrial HR activity resulted from contaminating nuclear proteins in the mitochondrial protein extract was explored. This was considered unlikely, since recent observations have shown that rat liver nuclei do not contain appreciable levels of HR activity (50Hino O. Tabata S. Hotta Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 9248-9252Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 51Thyagarajan B. Cruise J.L. Campbell C. Somatic Cell Mol. Genet. 1996; 22: 31-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). We nevertheless measured HR activity in four independently prepared nuclear extracts from rat liver nuclei but were unable to detect any HR activity from this source (data not shown). This result is in agreement with our recent observation that nuclear protein extracts from normal cells, unlike those prepared from immortalized cells, do not efficiently catalyze HR. 2B. Thyagarajan and C. Campbell, unpublished data. It is possible that the nuclear extracts prepared from normal cells are inactive due to the presence of an inhibitor of HR. If this were the case, it would be theoretically possible for a nuclear HR protein to contaminate mitochondrial fractions, while the putative inhibitor did not, thereby accounting for the apparent HR activity in mitochondrial extracts prepared from normal cells. Two independent arguments render this hypothesis untenable. First, we performed mixing experiments on nuclear protein extracts prepared from normal and immortalized cells, and found no evidence for a HR inhibitor in the former.2 Second, the specific activity of HR in mitochondrial extracts was essentially equal to that of nuclear extracts prepared from immortalized cells. It does not seem likely that (presumably) minor contamination of the mitochondrial extract by nuclear proteins could provide such robust HR activity. While homologous recombination is classically thought to occur via double-strand break repair (DSBR, see 52Szostak J.W. Orr-Weaver T.L. Rothstein R.J. Stahl F.W. Cell. 1983; 33: 25-35Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1737) Google Scholar for a review), an alternate pathway, based on sequential nuclease and re-annealing activity, termed single-strand annealing (SSA), has been shown to represent a major pathway for cellular recombination in mammalian nuclei (53Seidman M.M.

Biol. 1992; 12: 112-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), and also occurs in yeast (57Rudin N. Haber J.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 3918-3928Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 58Fishman-Lobell J. Rudin N. Haber J.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 1292-1303Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). A major distinguishing feature of the SSA and DSBR HR pathways is that in the former, homologous recombination is non-conservative, whereas in the latter, conservative recombination events occur. One would predict therefore that bacterial colonies containing plasmids with a single neomycin phosphotransferase gene result from SSA recombination, while DSBR-mediated recombination events will generate bacteria that harbor two neomycin phosphotransferase alleles (see Fig. 3). Neomycin phosphotransferase alleles resulting from DSBR recombination could be present in a number of different combinations. For example, if a simple reciprocal recombination event occurred between pSV2neoDL and pSV2neoDR, the bacteria would harbor one WT allele, and one double-deletion-bearing allele. These two alleles could be present on the same (dimer) molecule, or as two separate (monomer) molecules, depending on the orientation of the crossover event that generated them. Likewise, if a gene conversion event occurred (as illustrated in Fig. 3), the bacteria would harbor a WT allele, as well as either one or the other of the two substrate molecules (pSV2neoDL or pSV2neoDR). Once again, these alleles could be present as a dimer molecule or as two monomers. (A fundamental assumption here is that co-transformation of bacteria does not occur. We have verified that, under the conditions employed in our studies, co-transformation rarely occurs. We therefore conclude that bacterial colonies harboring two different plasmids result from transformation by recombinant molecules formed within with the mitochondrial protein extract.) We performed a homologous recombination experiment (see “Experimental Procedures”) using uncut pSV2neoDL and uncut pSV2"

Sequence analysis of peptides derived from them allowed us to identify their corresponding human cDNA sequences. The sequence of the α subunit predicted a soluble protein (104 kDa) devoid of known signals for residence in the ER. It showed homology with several other glucosidases but not with glucosidase I. Among the homologues, we identified a Saccharomyces cerevisiae gene, which we showed by gene disruption experiments to be the functional catalytic subunit of glucosidase II. The disrupted yeast strains had no detectable growth defect. The sequence of the β subunit (58 kDa) showed no sequence homology with other known proteins. It encoded a soluble protein rich in glutamic and aspartic acid with a putative ER retention signal (HDEL) at the C terminus. This suggested that the β subunit is responsible for the ER localization of the enzyme.

They retain glycoproteins in the ER while these are undergoing folding and, in some cases, oligomeric assembly. They also promote folding and oligomerization (11Hebert D. Foellmer B. Helenius A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2961-2968Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar, 12Vassilakos A. Cohen-Doyle M. Peterson P. Jackson M. Williams D. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1495-1506Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Once glycoproteins have adopted their mature, fully folded conformation, they are no longer recognized by the glucosyltransferase and are no longer reglucosylated (13Sousa M.C. Ferrero G.M. Parodi A.J. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 97-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). When glucosidase II removes the remaining Glc residues from such glycoproteins, they move out of the cycle and continue their maturation along the secretory pathway. In this chaperone cycle, glucosidase II has two separate functions. By removing the middle glucose, it allows binding of glycoproteins to calnexin and calreticulin, and by removing the innermost glucose, it releases the bound glycans from the lectins and prevents rebinding. Several reports have been published on the isolation and characterization of glucosidase II from different sources (14Burns D.M. Touster O. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 9990-10000PubMed Google Scholar, 15Brada D. Dubach U.C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1984; 141: 149-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 16Hino Y. Rothman J.E.

Dong Y.B. Vijay I.K. Biochem. J. 1987; 247: 563-570Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) identified it from animal tissues as a 60-70-kDa protein. In other cases (15Brada D. Dubach U.C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1984; 141: 149-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 16Hino Y. Rothman J.E. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 800-805Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 17Saxena S. Shailubhai K. Dong Y.B. Vijay I.K. Biochem. J. 1987; 247: 563-570Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), it was characterized as a 100-120-kDa polypeptide. No sequence data has been reported for glucosidase II from any source. To get further insight into the properties of this enzyme, we wanted to develop a reliable and reproducible purification procedure from rat liver microsomes that would allow us to clone the cDNA coding for it and to carry out structural studies. On doing so, we obtained a purified enzyme that was different from that described in previous reports. Instead of a single polypeptide chain, we found that the enzyme was a heterodimer of two distinct subunits. Sequence analysis of peptides derived from each subunit allowed us to identify their respective human cDNAs. We also identified a Saccharomyces cerevisiae gene very similar to the larger subunit and showed it to be the functional glucosidase II homologue in yeast. Together with the sequence homology with known glucosidases, this indicated that the large subunit was the catalytic component of glucosidase II. The smaller subunit is likely to mediate ER retention and retrieval of the enzyme. DEAE-Sephacel, concanavalin A-Sepharose, Mono Q, and Superdex columns were from Pharmacia Biotech Inc., ceramic hydroxylapatite was from Bio-Rad, and Poros HP 10 phenyl column was from Perseptive Biosystems (Cambridge, MA). All chemicals were from Sigma. Radiochemicals were from Amersham Corp. Protein concentration was determined by the method of Lowry (19Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Glucosidase II activity was measured by employing pnitrophenyl-α-D-glucopyranoside as substrate. Incubations were done in 20 mM HEPES buffer, pH 7.5, 5 mM substrate, in a total volume of 50 µl. After the indicated time at 37°C (typically 5-30 min) reactions were stopped by adding 50 µl of 2 M Tris base, and absorbance at 405 nm was determined. [14C]Glucose-Glc3Man9GlcNAc, [14C]glucose-Glc2Man9GlcNAc, and [14C]glucose-Glc1Man9GlcNAc were prepared and assayed as described previously (20Bosch M. Trombetta S. Engstrom U. Parodi A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 17360-17365Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 21Herscovics A. Jelinek-Kelly S. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 85-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). All the following steps were carried on ice or at 4°C in a cold room. Protease inhibitors were included in all of the buffers for the preparation of the microsomes and the extraction. The inhibitors used were phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, L-1-tosylamido-2-phenylethyl chloromethyl ketone, Nα-p-tosyl-L-lysine chloromethyl ketone (50 µg/ml each), aprotinin, leupeptin, pepstatin, and E64 (1 µg/ml each). Microsomes were isolated by standard differential centrifugation (22Fleischer S. Kervina M. Methods Enzymol. 1974; 31: 6-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar) using a solution containing sucrose 0.25 M, 5 mM EDTA, and 5 mM 2-mercaptoethanol. Microsomes were stored frozen at −20°C before being extracted (23Kreibich G. Sabatini D.D. Methods Enzymol. 1974; 31: 215-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Microsomes were resuspended at a final protein concentration of 4 mg/ml in a total volume of 800 ml of buffer A (20 mM Tris-HCl, 5 mM 2-mercaptoethanol, pH 7.5), containing the inhibitors mentioned above. Triton X-100 was added (from a 20% stock solution) to a final concentration of 0.05%. After 10 min on ice, the sample was centrifuged for 60 min at 100,000 × g. Alternatively, extraction was performed with 0.1 or 0.5% sodium cholate followed by ammonium sulfate fractionation. The soluble extract was brought to 30% saturation ammonium sulfate, and the precipitate was discarded. The supernatant was brought to 50% saturation, and the pellet was resuspended in a minimum volume of buffer A and dialyzed overnight against several changes of buffer A on ice. The soluble microsomal extract was loaded onto a column of DEAE-Sephacel (5 × 10 cm) equilibrated in buffer B (buffer A plus 0.1% Triton X-100). After washing with 200 ml of buffer B, the column was eluted with a linear gradient of 1200 ml from 0 to 500 mM NaCl in buffer B at a flow rate of 10 ml/min. Fractions of 20 ml were collected and assayed for glucosidase II activity. Peak fractions from the DEAE column containing glucosidase II activity were pooled. CaCl2, MnCl2, and MgCl2 were added to 1 mM and loaded onto a concanavalin A-Sepharose column (2.5 × 5 cm) equilibrated in buffer C (20 mM Tris-HCl, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM CaCl2, 1 mM MnCl2, 1 mM MgCl2, pH 7.5). After washing with 100 ml of buffer C, 20 ml of buffer D (buffer C containing 1 Mα-methylmannoside) were added to the column. After this addition, the column was warmed to 37°C for 30 min and eluted with more buffer D at 37°C. Glucosidase II activity was measured in the eluate. Activity eluted from the concanavalin A-Sepharose was loaded onto a Mono Q HR 5/5 column (Pharmacia) equilibrated in buffer A. Elution was performed by a linear gradient of 30 ml from 0 to 0.5 M NaCl in buffer D at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. 0.5-ml fractions were collected and assayed for glucosidase II activity. When necessary, the peak containing glucosidase activity was rerun on Mono Q under identical conditions to eliminate minor impurities. A Superdex 200 HR 10/30 column (Pharmacia) was equilibrated and run at 0.5 ml/min in 5 mM 2-mercaptoethanol, 150 mM NaCl, 10 mM HEPES, pH 7.5. Fractions of 0.4 ml were collected. A Poros HP10 column (4.6 × 50 mm, Perseptive Biosystems) was equilibrated in 10 mM HEPES, 5 mM 2-mercaptoethanol, 1 M ammonium sulfate, pH 7.4 (buffer E). The glucosidase II sample (300 µl of the Mono Q peak) was diluted 10-fold with buffer E, centrifuged 5 min at 15,000 × g, and loaded at 0.5 ml/min onto the column. Activity was eluted with a linear gradient from 100% buffer E to 100% buffer F (10 mM HEPES, 5 mM 2-mercaptoethanol, 10% sucrose, pH 7.4) over 20 ml at 0.5 ml/min. 0.5-ml fractions were collected. A column of 0.5 × 1 cm of ceramic hydroxylapatite (Bio-Rad) was equilibrated in 5 mM potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0. Glucosidase II (250 µl of the Mono Q peak fraction) was applied and eluted with 150-µl fractions of potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, of increasing concentration, at 10 mM increments up to 200 mM. Fractions of 150 µl were collected. Nondenaturing electrophoresis was carried out in 1.0-mm diameter tubes. Gels of 7 and 10% acrylamide concentration were prepared using 50 mM HEPES, 5 mM 2-mercaptoethanol, pH 7.4. 1 µg of pure glucosidase II was applied on top of the rod and run in the same buffer at 50 V until the tracking dye reached the bottom of the gels. Then the gel rod was extruded and equilibrated with denaturing sample buffer (containing 2% SDS and 20 mM DTT) for 15 min, and heated at 95°C for 5 min. The gel thus treated was applied on top of a 7.5% reducing SDS-PAGE slab gel, run, and stained with Coomassie Blue. Nonreducing gels were run in standard Laemmli gels (24Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar). Purified glucosidase II (1 µg) was resuspended in 5 µl of buffer containing 20% sucrose, 2% SDS, 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5. To nonreduced samples, N-ethylmaleimide was added to a final 20 mM concentration. To reduced samples, DTT was added to a final concentration of 10 mM. Both samples were heated at 95°C for 5 min, and N-ethylmaleimide was added to 20 mM to the reduced sample to allow direct comparison of reduced versus nonreduced samples. Both samples were run side by side in the same gel. For N-terminal sequence analysis, purified glucosidase II was alkylated with iodoacetamide and run on SDS-PAGE gels and transferred to Immobilon-P membranes. For internal sequence analysis, purified glucosidase II was run on SDS-PAGE, gels were Coomassie-stained, and the individual bands were digested in situ with trypsin. Peptides were eluted, alkylated, and separated by reverse phase high pressure liquid chromatography as described in 25Hellman U. Wernstedt C. Góñez J. Heldin C. Anal. Biochem. 1995; 224: 451-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (687) Google Scholar. For disruption of the α subunit gene in yeast, a polymerase chain reaction fragment was generated that included nucleotides 226-270 (5′-CTC ACT ACG GCA CTT GAG AGC TAT AAC TCA ATG AAC ATG TTG CTT-3′) and nucleotides 3184-3225 (5′-GTT ATT TTT TGA GGG AAA AAA ACG AAG TGA TAT CTT TAC ATC-3′) of gene Z36098 at the 5′- and 3′-ends, respectively, of the URA3 gene (26Lorenz S. Muir R. Lim E. McElver J. Weber S. Heitman J. Gene (Amst.). 1995; 158: 113-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). Strains NY914 (MATa, leu2,3-112, ura3-52, his3Δ200) and NY920 (MATα/a, leu2,3-112, ura3-52, his3Δ200) were transformed with the polymerase chain reaction fragment according to a standard lithium acetate protocol (27Becker D.M. Guarente L. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 182-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (676) Google Scholar). Uracil prototrophs were analyzed for disruption of the α subunit by a polymerase chain reaction approach, by using either two primers that were proximal to those used for the disruption (positions 208-225, 5′-CCC GGA CCA CGA CAT TTT, for the sense primer; positions 3243-3266, 5′-ACG GAT ATT TTT ACG TTT ACT TTG, for the antisense primer) or the α subunit primer 208-225 and a URA3 gene-specific antisense primer. Yeast cells were grown to an optical density of 0.5-0.7 at 600 nm and disrupted by vortexing in the presence of glass beads followed by boiling. To prevent glucose trimming or protein degradation during and after lysis, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (Boehringer Mannheim); 10 µM each chymostatin, leupeptin, antipain, and pepstatin; and 5 mM castanospermine (Sigma) were added to the lysis buffer (0.1% SDS, 100 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5). For Endo H treatment, pH 5.2 sodium acetate at 200 µM final concentration and 5 × 10−4 units of Endo H (Boehringer Mannheim) were added to the cell lysates, and samples were incubated for 14 h at 37°C. Samples were separated by SDS-PAGE, electrotransferred to nitrocellulose filters, and blotted for protein disulfide isomerase (PDI) (28LaMantia M. Miura T. Tachikawa H. Kaplan H. Lennarz W. Mizunaga T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 4453-4457Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar) according to standard protocols. Yeast cells were grown overnight to an early logarithmic phase in SC medium supplemented with the appropriate amino acids, pelleted, and resuspended in a small volume of medium (1.3 optical density units/200 µl of medium). After a preincubation at 37°C in the presence of 10 mM DTT, 100 µCi of [35S]methionine and [35S]cysteine (L-[35S] In Vitro Cell Labeling Mix; Amersham) was added, and the incubation continued for another 30 min. Protein synthesis was terminated by washing the cells in 2 volumes of ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline containing 20 mM sodium azide, and the cells were lysed as described for the Western blot assay. The SDS lysates were diluted 10-fold with 1% Triton X-100 in phosphate-buffered saline and the protease inhibitors described above, and CPY was immunoprecipitated overnight at 4°C after the addition of 2 µl of anti-CPY antiserum (29Brennwald P. Novick P. Nature. 1993; 362: 560-563Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar) and protein A-Sepharose beads (100 µl of a 20% (w/v) suspension). Immunocomplexes were washed twice in a buffer containing 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.3 M NaCl, 0.05% Triton X-100, and 0.1% SDS at room temperature, boiled in Laemmli sample buffer containing 25 mM DTT, and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Endo H treatment was done by boiling the immunoprecipitated samples in a buffer containing 0.2% SDS and 100 mM sodium acetate, pH 5.5, thereafter adding an equal volume of 100 mM sodium acetate, pH 5.5, and 5 × 10−4 units of Endo H, and incubation overnight at 37°C. In order to obtain enough purified glucosidase II that would enable us to get sequence information and to perform functional studies, we developed a purification protocol that emphasized rapid processing and high purity (Table I; see “Experimental Procedures” for details). We used rat livers as the starting material. Microsomes were isolated by standard subcellular fractionation in a solution containing 0.25 M sucrose, 5 mM 2-mercaptoethanol, and 5 mM EDTA. A soluble extract was prepared from the microsomal fraction using Triton X-100 and fractionated by DEAE-cellulose, concanavalin A-Sepharose, and Mono Q. When fractions containing glucosidase II activity from the Mono Q column were analyzed by SDS-PAGE, they contained two bands with apparent molecular masses of 110 and 80 kDa (Fig. 1A). Since a variety of experiments described below strongly indicated that the enzyme was a heterooligomer containing these polypeptides, we will call the larger subunit α and the smaller β.Table I.Purification of glucosidase II from rat liverFractionVolumeProteinActivityaOne unit was taken as the amount of enzyme that produced 1 µmol of product in 1 min at 37°C in 10 mM HEPES buffer, pH 7.5, using p-nitrophenyl-α-D-glucopyranoside as substrate.Specific activityTotal unitsYieldPurificationbFigures represent the total purification-fold relative to the specific activity present in microsomes.

Figures in parentheses represent the purification obtained relative to the previous fraction. Open table in a new tab Attempts to separate the α and β chains under conditions that preserved enzymatic activity were unsuccessful. As shown in Fig. 2, the same two proteins were found to co-elute with the glucosidase II activity in all of the high resolution chromatography columns tested including ion exchange, gel filtration, hydrophobic interaction, and hydroxylapatite chromatography (Fig. 2). Therefore, in the purification table only the Mono Q step is included, since the material obtained after it could no longer be fractionated. Different solubilization procedures were tested to rule out the possibility that the proteins would have associated as a result of a particular solubilization method. For this, rat liver microsomes were extracted with different concentrations of Triton X-100 (0.05, 0.1, 0.2, and 0.5%) or Lubrol (0.1 and 0.5%). Also, microsomes were extracted with sodium cholate (0.1 and 0.5%) followed by ammonium sulfate precipitation. The soluble material obtained from each individual solubilization trial was subjected to all the fractionation steps including DEAE-cellulose, concanavalin A-Sepharose, Mono Q, and Superdex 200. In all cases, the same two protein bands were present in equal proportions no matter which solubilization procedure was used. The co-purification of the two proteins was therefore not a consequence of a particular method of releasing the lumenal content from the microsomes. The specificity of the purified enzyme was tested on a panel of substrates (Table II). Both Glc1Man9GlcNAc and Glc2Man9GlcNAc, but not Glc3Man9GlcNAc, were hydrolyzed by the purified enzyme. It had a neutral pH optimum, but the activity was not affected by Ca2+, Mn2+, or Mg2+ (up to 20 mM), and it was not inhibited by EDTA (not shown). It was, however, effectively inhibited by the glucose analogs castanospermine and 1-deoxynojirimycin (I50≈ 15 µM) known to block glucosidase II (30Elbein A.D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1987; 56: 497-534Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The enzymatic properties were thus identical to those previously described (1Kornfeld R. Kornfeld S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1985; 54: 631-664Crossref PubMed Scopus (3779) Google Scholar, 2Hubbard S.C. Ivatt R.I. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1981; 50: 555-583Crossref PubMed Scopus (892) Google Scholar, 30Elbein A.D. Annu.

Open table in a new tab We were unable to separate the two polypeptides from each other or from the enzymatic activity by a variety of separation techniques (Fig. 2). Also, during nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis the two polypeptides migrated together (Fig. 1B). Upon sucrose gradient velocity centrifugation, a single peak of activity was found, containing α and β chains in the same proportion throughout the peak. The sedimentation coefficient (s20,w) determined by the method of Martin and Ames was 6.5 S (31Martin R.G. Ames B.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1961; 236: 1372-1379Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Gel filtration experiments indicated an approximate diffusion coefficient of 4.0 × 107 cm2/s. Combined with a calculated partial specific volume of 0.72, a molecular mass of 150,000 Da could be calculated for the active enzyme, indicating that it was a discrete multimer and not an aggregate of α and β subunits. The possibility that the β chain would be a proteolytic fragment of the α chain was unlikely on several accounts. Western blots showed that only the α band stained with a polyclonal antiserum made against the 110-kDa polypeptide of pig liver glucosidase II (3Lucocq J.M. Brada D. Roth J. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 102: 2137-2146Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Peptide maps of α and β chains were completely different (not shown). Finally, a comparison of SDS-PAGE mobilities before and after reduction indicated that the β subunit contained intrachain disulfides. It migrated faster in nonreduced form than in the reduced form, while α had a similar mobility under reducing and nonreducing conditions (Fig. 1A). This electrophoretic analysis also revealed that the α and β subunits were not connected by disulfide bonds. In conclusion, the results indicated that glucosidase II was a dimeric protein of about 150 kDa containing two different polypeptides. That α and β subunits were distinct gene products was further confirmed by their primary sequences shown in Fig. 3, Fig. 4.Fig. 4Sequence of the β subunit of glucosidase II.

As shown in Fig. 3, a BLAST search (32Altschul S. Gish W. Miller W. Myers E. Lipman D. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (71456) Google Scholar) identified a human cDNA of unknown function recently deposited in data bases (accession number D42041) to which all of the 11 peptide sequences obtained from the α chain, including the N and C termini, could be matched. The cDNA sequence available lacks an initiator ATG but predicts a hydrophobic signal sequence followed by a soluble protein of 912 amino acids (103,596 Da) in close agreement with the properties of the α subunit. It has two potential N-glycosylation sites, of which at least one appeared to be glycosylated based on concanavalin A-Sepharose binding (Table I) and sensitivity to Endo H (not shown). The sequence failed to show any putative hydrophobic transmembrane elements or a C-terminal KDEL ER retention/retrieval sequence. Analysis of the primary sequence revealed the presence of zones diagnostic of family 31 and family 9 glucosidases (Fig. 3) (33Henrissat B. Biochem. J. 1991; 280: 309-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (2651) Google Scholar). It also showed similarity to other known glucosidases: Hordeum vulgare α-glucosidase (U22450), human lysosomal α-glucosidase (Y00839), Schwanniomyces occidentalis glucoamylase (M60207), human, rabbit and rat sucrase-isomaltase (X63597, M14046, and L25926), Aspergillus oryzae α-glucosidase (D45179), and Candida tsukubaensis α-glucosidase (X56024). It therefore seemed likely that the α subunit contained the catalytic domain of the enzyme. A gene from chromosome II of S. cerevisiae (Z36098; 34Feldman H. et al.EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5795-5809Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar) was very similar to the human cDNA across the entire open reading frame (59% similarity, 39% identity, Fig. 3).

https://openalex.org/W1977606211,"GDP-L-Fuc:N-acetyl-β-D-glucosaminide α1→6fucosyltransferase (α1-6FucT; EC 2.4.1.68), which catalyzes the transfer of fucose from GDP-Fuc to N-linked type complex glycopeptides, was purified from a Triton X-100 extract of porcine brain microsomes. The purification procedures included sequential affinity chromatographies on GlcNAcβ1-2Manα1-6(GlcNAcβ1-2Manα1-2)Manβ1-4GlcNAcβ1-4GlcNAc-Asn-Sepharose 4B and synthetic GDP-hexanolamine-Sepharose 4B columns. The enzyme was recovered in a 12% final yield with a 440,000-fold increase in specific activity. SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of the purified enzyme gave a major band corresponding to an apparent molecular mass of 58 kDa. The α1-6FucT has 575 amino acids and no putative N-glycosylation sites. The cDNA was cloned in to pSVK3 and was then transiently transfected into COS-1 cells. α1-6FucT activity was found to be high in the transfected cells, as compared with non- or mock-transfected cells. Northern blotting analyses of rat adult tissues showed that α1-6FucT was highly expressed in brain. No sequence homology was found with other previously cloned fucosyltransferases, but the enzyme appears to be a type II transmembrane protein like the other glycosyltransferases.

Detailed analysis of specific antigens on the surface of various carcinoma cells revealed that carcinoma-specific sugar chains are expressed on the cell surface. A well documented phenotypic alteration of these specific sugar chains is the increase in the molecular weight of cell surface complex type N-linked glycan in transformed cells. This change has been observed regardless of the nature of the transforming agent: oncogenic viruses (5Yamashita K. Ohkura T. Tachibana Y. Takasaki S. Kobata A. J. Biol.

This phenomenon was thought to reflect the deviation of carcinoma cells from the ordinary differentiation processes. α-Fucose residue attached to asparagine-linked GlcNAc also have some relationship with carcinogenesis.

In this study we purified a novel α1-6FucT, which is a different enzyme from the α1-6FucTs previously reported, especially in terms of the pH optimum and molecular weight. The cDNA sequence of this enzyme was also determined for the first time. A highly specific assay method involving a fluorescent reagent, 4-(2-pyridylamino)butylamine (PABA), made it possible to purify the enzyme (28Uozumi N. Teshima T. Yamamoto T. Nishikawa A. Miyoshi E. Islam K.N. Fujii S. Shiba T. Taniguchi N. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1996; 120: 385-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). 2-Amino pyridine was obtained from Wako Pure Chemicals. β-Galactosidase (Aspergillus sp.) was obtained from Toyobo Co. TSK-gel ODS-80TM and Amide-80 columns were purchased from Tosoh. Bovine γ-globulin and Pronase (Streptomyces griseus) were purchased from Sigma and Seikagaku Kogyo Co., respectively. Fluorescence-labeled oligosaccharides were obtained from the corresponding oligosaccharides as described previously (28Uozumi N. Teshima T. Yamamoto T. Nishikawa A. Miyoshi E. Islam K.N. Fujii S. Shiba T. Taniguchi N. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1996; 120: 385-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Briefly, a glycopeptide derived from bovine γ-globulin on digestion with Pronase was coupled with PABA using water-soluble carbodimide. Further purification was performed by HPLC on a TSK-gel ODS-80TM column (4.6 × 150 mm) that had been equilibrated with 20 mM acetate buffer, pH 4.0, containing 0.1% butanol, at a flow rate of 1 ml/min isocratically. The eluted pyridylamino sugars were detected with a fluorescence spectrophotometer, the excitation and emission wavelengths being 320 and 400 nm, respectively. The enzyme activity was determined as described (28Uozumi N. Teshima T. Yamamoto T. Nishikawa A. Miyoshi E. Islam K.N. Fujii S. Shiba T. Taniguchi N. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1996; 120: 385-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). In brief, the standard incubation mixture for the α1-6FucT assay contained the following components, in a final volume of 50 µl: 200 mM MES-NaOH buffer, pH 7.0, 1% Triton X-100, 50 µM acceptor (GnGn-Asn-PABA), and 500 µM donor (GDP-Fuc) substrates. After the mixture had been incubated at 37°C for 2 h, the reaction was stopped by heating at 100°C for 1 min. The sample was centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 10 min, and then 10 µl of the supernatant was used for analyses. The product was separated by HPLC on a TSK-gel ODS-80TM column (4.6 × 150 mm). Elution was performed at 55°C with 20 mM acetate buffer, pH 4.0, containing 0.1% butanol in an isocratic way. Fluorescence of the column eluate was detected with a fluorescence spectrophotometer (model RF 535; Shimadzu, Japan), the excitation and emission wavelengths being 320 and 400 nm, respectively. The amount of product was estimated from the fluorescence intensity. The specific activity of the enzyme was expressed as pmol of fucose transferred/h/mg of protein. Protein was determined with a Bio-Rad protein assay kit using bovine serum albumin as a standard. GDP-hexanolamine was synthesized by the method of Nunez, et al. (29Nunez H.A. O'Connor J.V. Rosevear P.R. Barker R. Can. J. Chem. 1981; 59: 2086-2095Crossref Scopus (74) Google Scholar) with a slight modification. Briefly, GMP was activated with morphoridate and then coupled to 6-aminohexylphosphate. The end product was completely purified on a TSK gel ODS TM80 column (4.6 × 150 mm). The structure of the GDP-hexanolamine column was confirmed by 1H NMR analyses (data not shown). A porcine brain (100 g) was homogenized in 4 volumes of 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, containing 0.25 M sucrose, 1 mM benzamidine hydrochloride, and 20 µM 4-(amidinophenyl)methanesulfonyl fluoride, with a Polytron homogenizer (Brinkmann Instruments). After centrifugation at 900 × g for 10 min, the resultant supernatant was centrifuged at 105,000 × g for 1 h. The pellet was resuspended in a 1000-ml solution of 20 mM phosphate-KOH, pH 7.0, 50 mM KCl, 5 mM EDTA, and 0.5% Triton X-100 buffer and then extracted by gentle stirring for 7 days using a magnetic stirrer, followed by centrifugation at 105,000 × g for 1 h. The supernatant was collected and concentrated to 75 ml using a YM 30 membrane (Amicon). The above extract was applied to a column (16 × 5 cm; Pharmacia HR 16/10) of GnGn-bi-Asn-Sepharose 4B, which had been equilibrated with the 20 mM phosphate-KOH, pH 7.0, 50 mM KCl, 5 mM EDTA, and 0.5% Triton X-100 buffer. The column was washed with the same buffer and then eluted with the washing buffer containing 1 M KCl. Enzymatically active fractions obtained from the GnGn-bi-Asn-Sepharose 4B column were collected, desalted against 20 mM phosphate-KOH buffer, pH 7.0, containing 50 mM KCl, 5 mM EDTA, and 0.5% Triton X-100, using a YM30 membrane (Amicon), and then applied to a GDP-hexanolamine-Sepharose 4B column (16 × 5 cm; Pharmacia HR16/10), which had been equilibrated with 20 mM potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, containing 50 mM KCl, 5 mM EDTA, and 0.05% Triton X-100. After washing with the same buffer sufficiently, the column-bound enzyme was eluted with 20 mM potassium phosphate buffer containing 50 mM KCl, 5 mM EDTA, 0.01% Triton X-100, and 100 mM GDP. SDS-PAGE was performed to verify the purity of each eluted fraction according to the Laemmli method (30Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207018) Google Scholar). Isoelectric focusing gel electrophoresis was carried out on a pI 3-9 gradient gel (Pharmacia) according to the manufacturer's instructions using 1 µg of the purified enzyme. At the same time, another 1 µg of the purified enzyme was applied to another lane of the same gel. After electrophoresis, one lane was cut into pieces, and each slice was sonicated and extracted with the assay mixture. Then α1-6FucT activity was measured. At the same time, the remaining lane was stained with silver utilizing Sil-Best Stain (Nacalai Tesque) according to the manufacturer's instructions. SDS-PAGE was performed by the method described by Laemmli (30Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207018) Google Scholar) in the presence or absence of 2-mercaptoethanol. The gels were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue G-250 and silver. To determine the N-terminal amino acid sequences, the material corresponding to the 54-kDa band was excised from a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore) and then sequenced with an Applied Biosystem 473A Protein Sequencer. To determine internal amino acid sequences, 13 µg of the purified protein transferred onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane was digested with 1 µg of lysyl endopeptidase in 100 mM Tris and 5% acetonitrile, pH 8.2, at 37°C for 12 h. The resultant peptides were separated by reverse phase HPLC on a Vydac C-18 column (250 × 2.1 mm), using a 0-60% acetonitrile gradient in 0.05% trifluoroacetic acid. Five peptides were obtained and applied to a Polybrene-coated trifluoroacetic acid-activated precycled glass fiber filter for amino acid sequencing and were analyzed with an Appled Biosystems 473A protein sequencer. Total RNA was isolated from a porcine brain according to general methods. Poly(A)+ was further purified on an oligo(dT)-cellulose (Pharmacia) column. The first strand cDNA was synthesized with a cDNA synthesis kit (Life Technologies, Inc.), using primer A11, according to the manufacturer's manual (see Fig. 8). Four oligonucleotides were synthesized for use as primers in PCR (see Fig. 7). PCR was carried out in 50-µl reaction mixtures containing first strand cDNA corresponding to 1 µg of poly(A)+ RNA, 50 pmol of a pair of degenerate oligonucleotides, 50 mM KCl, 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.3, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 0.001% gelatin, and 200 µM dNTP. After a hot start at 98°C, 25 cycles (94°C for 1 min, 55°C for 2 min, 72°C for 3 min) of PCR were performed using 2.5 units of Thermus aquaticus (Taq) polymerase. The PCR products were subcloned into a pT7BlueT-Vector (Novagen). A porcine brain λgt11 cDNA library (Clonetech) was screened by plaque hybridization utilizing the [α-32P]dCTP (3,000 Ci/mmol; Amersham) of a labeled reverse transcription-PCR product, S-A12 (see Fig. 8). Five positive plaques were obtained from 4 × 105 plaques in the first screening. The screening was repeated 3 times, and then the inserts of the five isolated clones were amplified using forward (GGTGGCGACGACTCCTGGAGCCCG) and reversal (CGTGTATTCCTCAATGGGATGGAA) primers by means of PCR reaction, and the DNA sequence was directly determined with a DNA Sequencing Kit of Dye Terminator Cycle Sequencing Ready Reaction (Perkin-Elmer) using forward and reversal primers as sequencing primers. Based on the determined insert cDNA sequence, sequencing primers were synthesized, and the space between each sequencing primer was 200 nucleotides. Finally the full length of the insert cDNA sequence was determined. The coding region of cDNA of α1-6FucT was amplified using forward (ggaattccGAGTTGAAAGTCTGAAAATGCGG) and reversal (tcccccgggggaCTTTCTCATCTGTCCGTC) primers by means of PCR reaction. The obtained PCR product was double digested by SmaI and EcoRI and subcloned into calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase-treated pSVK3, which was previously double digested by SmaI and EcoRI. pSVK3 was then transiently transfected into COS-1 cells by electroporation (Bio-Rad). Total RNA was prepared from rat cerebrum and cerebellum according to general methods. 20 µg of total RNA was chromatographed on a 0.8% agarose gel containing 2.2 M formaldehyde. The size-fractionated RNA was transferred to a ζ-Probe membrane (Bio-Rad) by capillary action. After hybridization with 32P-labeled S-A12 fragment (see Fig. 9) at 42°C, the membrane was washed at 55°C in 2 × SSC (1 × SSC: 15 mM sodium citrate and 150 mM NaCl, pH 7.0) containing 0.1% SDS. The Kodak x-ray film was exposed for 3 days at −80°C. A porcine brain was chosen as a source of the enzyme for purification based on the fact that porcine and rat brains are the most abundant sources of the enzyme (Table I).Table IDistribution of α1-6FucT in normal rat tissuesTissuesSpecific activitypmol/h/mg proteinBrain (3Fenderson B.A. Holmes E.H.

GnGn-bi-Asn-Sepharose 4B chromatography resulted in a 61% yield and 2,800-fold purification (Table II). The majority of total protein loaded was eluted in the flow-through fraction of a column, as shown in Fig. 1. Although most glycosyltransferases and lectins were not retained by the column, porcine brain α1-6FucT is fully active in EDTA, as discussed below. From the beginning, enzyme activity began to be eluted gradually from the column, suggesting that the α1-6FucT exhibits heterogeneity. This is likely to be the reason why a 60% recovery of the total activity loaded was achieved when the column was eluted with KCl.Table IIPurification of α1-6FucT of porcine brainStepsVolumeProteinTotal activitySpecific activityPurificationYieldmlmgnmol/hnmol/h/mg protein-fold%Triton X-100 extract753,6802,2200.61100GnGn-bi-Asn-Sepharose 4B100.801,3501,6882,81361GDP- (CH2)6-NH2-Sepharose 4B0.20.01262262,200437,00012 Open table in a new tab After the buffer had been changed using an Amicon YM30, the final purification step was accomplished on a synthetic GDP-hexanolamine ligand column. Chromatography on an immobilized GDP-hexanolamine column resulted in an additional 155-fold purification with a 19.7% yield compared with the previous step. The elution profile from this column clearly showed that the majority of the contaminating protein was not bound to the column and that the enzyme was eluted from this column with GDP. Starting with frozen porcine brain (100 g), α1-6FucT was purified 440,000-fold with a total yield of 12%, as summarized in Table II. In order to assess the level of purification of α1-6FucT, fractions eluted from a GDP-hexanolamine column were subjected to SDS-PAGE. A photograph of this gel, which was stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue G-250 is shown in Fig. 2. The most purified sample in lanes 28 and 29 gave one major band corresponding to an apparent mass of 58 kDa (indicated by an arrow on the right). The enzymatic profiles of α1-6FucT of porcine brain were obtained utilizing the purified protein. The purified enzyme was incubated by the enzyme assay method, and an aliquot was subjected to HPLC. A typical elution pattern is shown in Fig. 3. The substrate and product were eluted at 12.2 and 22.6 min, respectively. The product exhibits the same elution pattern as the α1-6FucT of porcine liver (28Uozumi N. Teshima T. Yamamoto T. Nishikawa A. Miyoshi E. Islam K.N. Fujii S. Shiba T. Taniguchi N. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1996; 120: 385-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The reaction mixture without GDP-Fuc was also subjected to HPLC. Compared with the elution pattern of the reaction mixture with GDP-Fuc, no enzymatic product was detected in the absence of GDP-Fuc in the reaction mixture. To confirm the structure of the product, the reaction was performed on a large scale, and the enzymatic product was analyzed with an ion spray mass spectrophotometer. The substrate, GnGn-bi-Asn-PABA, has a molecular weight of 1576. In contrast, the enzymatic product has one of 1725. This indicated that this α1-6FucT catalyzes the transfer of 1 mol of fucose to 1 mol of GnGn-bi-Asn-PABA (data not shown). The chemical shift value of the enzymatic product on 1H NMR analysis was the same as synthesized GnGnF-bi-Asn-PABA, which had previously been published (28Uozumi N. Teshima T. Yamamoto T. Nishikawa A. Miyoshi E. Islam K.N. Fujii S. Shiba T. Taniguchi N. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1996; 120: 385-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The enzymatic product gave the two typical signals of fucose at δ = 4.864 ppm (H-1) and δ = 1.193 ppm (CH3) (Table III, boldface type).Table III.Structural analysis of enzymatic productReporter groupResidueChemical shift of enzymatic productH-1GlcNAc-15.049GlcNAc-2NDaND, not detectable.GlcNAc-54.568GlcNAc-5′4.547Man-34.765Man-45.120Man-4′4.914α1-6Fuc4.864H-2Man-34.239Man-44.182Man-4′4.100CH3α1-6Fuc1.193NAcGlcNAc-11.997GlcNAc-22.085GlcNAc-5-5′2.051a ND, not detectable. Open table in a new tab The purified enzyme was incubated under various conditions. The pH optimum was 7.0 (Fig. 4), and divalent cations such as Mg2+ and Ca2+ were found to have negligible effects on the activity. This enzyme was fully active in the presence of 5 mM EDTA (Fig. 4). In the presence of 5 mM EDTA at pH 7.0, the Km values for GnGn-bi-Asn-PABA and GDP-Fuc were 25.0 and 46 µM, respectively. 100 g of porcine brain was homogenized one time, and then extraction and purification of the enzyme were performed according to the method described in steps 1-3. These steps were repeated 20 times for approximately 2 kg of porcine brain, and the eluate from step 3 was collected and pooled in 20 mM potassium phosphate, pH 7.0, containing 1 M KCl, 5 mM EDTA, and 0.1% Triton X-100. In this solution, α1-6FucT is fully stable. The pooled fractions were desalted against 20 mM potassium phosphate, pH 7.0, containing 50 mM KCl, and 5 mM EDTA, using a YM30 membrane, and step 3 was performed again for the total pooled fractions. The eluted fractions were collected and desalted against 20 mM potassium phosphate, pH 7.0, containing 50 mM KCl, and 5 mM EDTA, and then applied to a GDP-hexanolamine-Sepharose 4B column (16 × 5 cm; Pharmacia HR16/10), which had been equilibrated with 20 mM potassium phosphate buffer containing 50 mM KCl, 5 mM EDTA, and 0.05% Triton X-100. After the column had been washed with the same buffer sufficiently, enzymes were eluted with 20 mM potassium phosphate buffer containing 50 mM KCl, 5 mM EDTA, 0.01% Triton X-100, and 5 mM GDP. The eluted fractions were collected and used for further experiments. The most purified fraction obtained on a GDP-hexanolamine affinity column migrates as one major component, 58 kDa, on SDS-PAGE under nonreducing conditions, and under reducing conditions the molecular mass of this component changes from 58 to 54 kDa (Fig. 5). The same component gave a diffuse band on isoelectric focusing at pI 7.0, and α1-6FucT activity was detected in the gel slices corresponding to this band (Fig. 6).Fig. 6Isoelectric focusing of the purified α1-6FucT. α1-6FucT gave a diffuse band corresponding to pI 7.0. The major α1-6FucT activity was localized at this band.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The N-terminal sequence determined from a component of 54 kDa on SDS-PAGE was used to design sense strand PCR primers. The internal peptide sequence was determined from four lysyl endopeptidase-derived peptides (Fig. 7) and was used to design several antisense strand PCR primers. The five transcript-specific oligonucleotides obtained were used to amplify a cDNA that encodes the α1-6FucT (Fig. 7). Agarose gel electrophoresis of the PCR products demonstrated that antisense primer A12 produced a 1.45-kilobase pair DNA fragment (Fig. 8). The PCR product, S-A12, was then subcloned into pT7 Blue-Vector (Novagen), and the full-length sequence was determined (data not shown). From a λgt11 cDNA library of porcine brain (Clonetech), cDNA encoding α1-6FucT was also isolated, utilizing the PCR product as a probe. Five positive clones, C1, C2, C3, C4, and C5, were obtained as described in Fig. 8. Clones C1 and C2 appeared to contain the full-length α1-6FucT open reading frame, and the nucleotide sequence was determined from these two clones. The DNA sequence determined from the PCR product, S-A12, was completely identical to that of cDNA clone isolated from the λgt11 cDNA library. The translated sequence of α1-6FucT is shown in Fig. 9A. The 1,728-base pair open reading frame encodes a 575-amino acid polypeptide. The deduced amino acid composition was identical to that of the purified enzyme determined by amino acid analysis. Both the N-terminal and internal peptide amino acid sequences are included within the predicted sequence, as underlined in Fig. 9A. To verify that the cloned cDNA encodes α1-6FucT transferase, the coding region of cDNA was subcloned into the mammalian expression vector, pSVK3, and then the vector was transfected into COS-1 cells. After 48 h, the cells were harvested, and α1-6FucT activity was measured in the homogenate. Preliminary experiments indicated that untransfected COS-1 cells show very little enzyme activity. COS-1 cells transfected with an expression vector containing α1-6FucT showed high activity, i.e. 2,360 pmol/h/mg of protein, compared with the cells transfected with the control plasmid, mock pSVK3 (Table IV).Table IVExpression of porcine α1-6FucT in COS-1 cellsConditionsActivitiespmol/h/mg proteinNo plasmid13pSVK3 (10 µg)18α1-6FucT cDNA (20 µg)1,789α1-6FucT cDNA (40 µg)2,360 Open table in a new tab Northern blotting analysis of total RNA from rat brain showed a band at 3.5 kilobases (Fig. 10).

In this paper we found that these chromatographies using donor and acceptor substrates as ligand were fairly effective for purification of α1-6FucT from porcine brain. Electrophoresis of the purified α1-6FucT gave a diffuse single band on the isoelectric focusing at pI 7.0 (Fig. 6). Based on the deduced amino acid composition from the cDNA sequence, the pI is 7.39.

Monoclonal antibodies directed toward metal chelating agents or metal-chelate complexes have many potential uses both in medicine and in environmental analysis. In medicine, chelator-linked antibodies have been used in vivo to transport and deliver radioisotopes to specific target sites, such as tumors (1Camera L. Kinuya S. Garmestani K. Wu C. Brechbiel M.W.

The availability of monoclonal antibodies to the chelating agent has permitted researchers to investigate the biodistribution of these “magic bullets” in cancer chemotherapy (4Reardan D.T. Meares C.F. Goodwin D.A. McTigue M. David G.S. Stone M.R. Leung J.P. Bartholomew R.M. Frincke J.M. Nature. 1985; 316: 265-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). In environmental analysis, the availability of monoclonal antibodies that can distinguish among different metals provides a basis for rapid, sensitive immunoassays that can be used on-site to assess heavy metal contamination (5Chakrabarti P. Hatcher F.M. Blake II, R.C. Ladd P.A. Blake D.A. Anal. Biochem. 1994; 217: 70-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 6Wylie D.E. Carlson L.D. Carlson R. Wagner F.W. Schuster S.M. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 194: 381-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Monoclonal antibodies that bind to chelators such as diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid and 1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecane-N,N′,N″,N‡‡-tetraacetic acid have been reported (7Gillete R.W. Singleton J. Janowicz A. Gilman S.C. J. Immunol. Methods. 1989; 124: 277-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar, 8Anderson W.H.K. Reed J.A. Pollock D.K. Hybridoma. 1992; 12: 677-688Crossref Scopus (4) Google Scholar); however, these antibodies were directed primarily toward the chelate portion of the molecule and did not demonstrate the ability to differentiate among various metals bound in the chelate complex. Two hybridomas that synthesized monoclonal antibodies showing metal ion specificity have also been reported. The first, CHA255, was the result of immunization with a derivative of In(III)-EDTA coupled to a carrier protein by a thioureido-L-benzyl group (4Reardan D.T. Meares C.F. Goodwin D.A. McTigue M. David G.S. Stone M.R. Leung J.P. Bartholomew R.M. Frincke J.M. Nature. 1985; 316: 265-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). The monoclonal antibody synthesized by CHA255 bound to a variety of chelate complexes but bound to indium-chelate complexes more tightly than it did to other chelated metals (4Reardan D.T. Meares C.F. Goodwin D.A. McTigue M. David G.S. Stone M.R. Leung J.P. Bartholomew R.M. Frincke J.M. Nature. 1985; 316: 265-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar, 9Meyer D.L. Fineman M.

Monoclonal antibodies directed toward mercuric ions have also been elicited by immunization of animals with a glutathione-Hg derivative (10Wylie D.E. Lu D. Carlson L.D. Carlson R. Babacan K.F. Schuster S.M. Wagner F.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 4104-4108Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). These antibodies, which bind to mercury with high affinity, have been used to detect mercuric ions in aqueous samples (6Wylie D.E. Carlson L.D. Carlson R. Wagner F.W. Schuster S.M. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 194: 381-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) and are the basis for a commercially available immunoassay to monitor mercury contamination in environmental samples. The molecular features responsible for an antibody's ability to differentiate among metals have been explored in some detail with CHA255 (11Love R.A. Villafranca J.E. Aust R.M. Nakamura K.K. Jue R.A. Major J.G. Radhakrishnan R. Butler W.F. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 10950-10959Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Binding studies have shown that CHA255 was highly specific for the indium chelate; the antibody's affinity decreased from 24- to 20,000-fold when other metals were substituted for In(III) in the chelate complex. The structural basis for this fine discrimination was investigated by x-ray crystallographic analyses of the antigen-binding fragment complexed with either In(III) or Fe(III) chelates of thioureido-L-benzyl-EDTA. A notable feature of the antibody-In(III)-EDTA complex was the additional coordination of the chelated metal by a histidine residue from the heavy chain's third complementarity determining region. This histidine coordination did not occur in the corresponding Fe(III) complex, due to a slightly different hapten coordination that reduced access to the metal. It was concluded that the absence of the histidine ligation was largely responsible for the 24-fold lower binding of the iron hapten to CHA255 relative to that of the indium hapten. The larger differences in the binding affinities observed with other metals were attributed to different configurations of the EDTA moiety around individual metal ions. The present study describes the preparation and characterization of a metal-specific monoclonal antibody generated in a manner analogous to that used for CHA255. Equilibrium binding and kinetic studies revealed two principal features of the binding of metal chelates to this antibody. (i) The binding was metal-specific; of 16 metal ions tested, the greatest affinity was reserved for Cd(II) and Hg(II). (ii) The binding affinity increased with the complexity of the organic chelator, indicating that the ureido-L-benzyl portion of the hapten participated in the binding reaction. The sequence of the light and heavy chain variable regions were deduced from the corresponding cDNA produced from PCR 1The abbreviations used are: PCRpolymerase chain reactionELISAenzyme-linked immunosorbent assayBSAbovine serum albuminPBSphosphate-buffered salineKLHkeyhole limpet hemocyaninCd-EDTA-BSAbovine serum albumin-thioureido-L-benzyl-ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid-cadmium conjugateCd-EDTA-KLHkeyhole limpet hemocyanin-thioureido-L-benzyl-ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid-cadmium conjugateEOTUBE4-[N′-(2-hydroxyethyl)thioureido]-L-benzyl-EDTAr.m.s.root mean squareCDRcomplementarity determining regionHheavy chainLlight chain. -amplified regions of the corresponding genes.

Fluorescein isothiocyanate conjugate of affinity purified goat-antimouse IgG was a product of Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories (West Grove, PA). Polymethylmethacrylate beads (140-170 mesh) were obtained from Bangs Laboratories (Carmel, IN). Reagents for tissue culture and ELISA were obtained as described previously (5Chakrabarti P. Hatcher F.M. Blake II, R.C. Ladd P.A. Blake D.A. Anal. Biochem. 1994; 217: 70-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Glassware was mixed acid-washed (12Thiers R.C. Methods Biochem.

Protein-chelate complexes were prepared as described previously (5Chakrabarti P. Hatcher F.M. Blake II, R.C. Ladd P.A. Blake D.A. Anal. Biochem. 1994; 217: 70-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) and loaded with cadmium from a stock solution prepared by dissolving cadmium foil in warm ultrapure concentrated nitric acid. Purification and characterization of the conjugates were as described previously (5Chakrabarti P. Hatcher F.M. Blake II, R.C. Ladd P.A. Blake D.A. Anal.

Extent of substitution of free lysine groups was 33.2% for the BSA-thioureido-L-benzyl-ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid-cadmium conjugate (Cd-EDTA-BSA) and 15% for KLH-thioureido-L-benzyl-ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid-cadmium conjugate (Cd-EDTA-KLH). A second Cd-EDTA-BSA conjugate with 54.7% lysine substitution was used for determination of equilibrium binding constants. Three mice were injected intraperitoneally at 2-week intervals with 50 µg of the Cd-EDTA-KLH conjugate emulsified in Ribi adjuvant (Ribi Immunochemicals, Hamilton, MT). Third and fourth injections were given 30 and 45 days after the second boost. After the fourth injection, blood was collected from the tail vein, and antibody response was determined by indirect ELISA (described below). A final boost of 50 µg of Cd-EDTA-KLH conjugate in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, 137 mM NaCl, 3 mM KCl, 10 mM sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4) was given intraperitoneally 4 days prior to fusion. Mouse spleen cells were fused with myeloma cells (X63-Ag 8.653) using polyethylene glycol (13Gefter M.L. Margulies D.H. Scharff M.D. Somatic Cell Mol.

Monoclonal antibody producing clones were selected by assaying the reactivity of culture supernatants in competitive ELISA format (5Chakrabarti P. Hatcher F.M. Blake II, R.C. Ladd P.A. Blake D.A. Anal. Biochem. 1994; 217: 70-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) using a cadmium-EDTA complex as the inhibiting antigen. Ascites fluids were produced in mice by intraperitoneally injecting each of four mice with 1.27 × 106 hybridoma cells. BALB/c mice were primed with incomplete Freund's adjuvant 7 days before injection of cells. Ascites fluids were obtained after 10-15 days of injection. Heavy chain specificity of the monoclonal antibody was determined by sandwich ELISA using the subisotyping kit produced by Hyclone Laboratories (Logan, UT). The immunoglobulin G fraction of ascites was isolated using EZ SEP IgG partitioning medium according to the manufacturer's instructions. Further purification of monoclonal antibody was achieved by chromatography on a Protein G-Superose column (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.). Protein concentration of the purified monoclonal antibody was determined by the method of Bradford (14Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (211983) Google Scholar). The concentration of IgG in the purified product and the light chain specificity of the antibody was determined by sandwich ELISA. Equilibrium and kinetic measurements of the interactions of chelated metals with the 2A81G5 monoclonal antibody were performed with a KinExA™ automated immunoassay system (Sapidyne Instruments, Inc., Boise, ID). Briefly, the KinExA™ system is comprised of a capillary flow/observation cell (inner diameter = 1.6 mm) fitted with a microporous screen through which various solutions are drawn under negative pressure. Uniform particles larger than the average pore size of the screen (53 µm) were precoated with antigen and deposited above the screen in a packed bed. Individual solution mixtures of antigen and antibody either at or approaching equilibrium were then drawn through the packed bed of particles. Only those antibodies in each mixture with unoccupied binding sites were available to bind to the antigen coated on the solid phase. Quantification of primary antibody thus captured was achieved by the brief exposure of the particles to a fluorescently labeled anti-species secondary antibody, followed by measurement of the resulting fluorescence from the particles after removal of excess unbound reagents. For either equilibrium or kinetic measurements, polymethylmethacrylate beads (98 ± 8 µm) were coated with antigen by suspending 200 mg (dry weight) of beads in 1.0 ml of PBS containing 100 µg of Cd-EDTA-BSA. After 1.0 h of gentle agitation at 37°C, the beads were centrifuged, and the supernatant solution was decanted. Any nonspecific protein binding sites remaining on the beads were blocked by the subsequent incubation of the beads with 1.0 ml of 10% (w/v) goat serum in PBS for an additional h at 37°C. The blocked beads were stored at 4°C in the blocking solution until further use. A bead pack approximately 4 mm high was created in the observation cell by drawing 675 µl of a suspension of the blocked beads in PBS (6.7 mg beads/ml) over the screen at a flow rate of 1.5 ml/min and washing the retained beads with sufficient PBS buffer (1.0 ml) to remove the excess goat serum. The beads were then gently disrupted with a brief backflush of PBS (50 µl at 300 µl/min), followed by a 20-s settling period to create a uniform and reproducible pack. For equilibrium measurements, the 2A81G5 monoclonal antibody (final concentration of 0.1 µg/ml) was mixed with metal-chelates in PBS or individual metal ions in PBS amended with 5.0 mM EDTA. When the metal ion was Ag(I), 0.05 M HEPES, pH 7.4, was substituted for the PBS. BSA was present at 0.5 mg/ml in the reaction mixture to reduce nonspecific binding of the primary antibody. Once equilibrium was achieved (less than 2 min in all cases), 500 µl of the mixture were drawn past the beads, followed by 166 µl of the PBS-EDTA buffer to wash out unbound primary antibody and excess metal chelate. One ml of fluorescein-labeled goat antimouse antibody (1.0 µg/ml in PBS-EDTA containing 1 mg/ml BSA) was then drawn past the beads. All solution transfers up to this point were accomplished with a flow rate of 500 µl/min. Unbound labeled secondary antibody was subsequently removed by drawing 3.0 ml of PBS-EDTA through the bead pack over a period of 2 min. For equilibrium measurements with soluble Cd-EDTA-BSA, the assay protocol was modified by lowering the final concentration of 2A81G5 to 0.01 µg/ml. A signal-to-noise ratio identical to that observed with 0.1 µg/ml of antibody was achieved by drawing a 10-fold greater volume of the reaction mixture (5.0 ml) past the packed beads. Control experiments showed that the signal amplitude was independent of the concentration of the primary antibody as long as the beads were exposed to the same total number of antibody molecules. For kinetic measurements, equal volumes (250 µl) of the primary antibody (0.2 µg/ml) and metal-chelate solutions were mixed at rates of 250 µl/min each. The binding reaction proceeded for the 11 s it took the mixture to transverse the distance from the point of mixing to the point where the bead pack was first encountered. One ml of labeled secondary antibody was then drawn past the beads (at 500 µl/min), followed by 1.5 ml (at 750 µl/min) of PBS-EDTA. Data acquisition (initiated in all cases at the introduction of primary antibody to the beads) and instrument control were accomplished via a Toshiba Satellite™ 486/33 notebook computer interfaced to the KinExA™ using software provided by Sapidyne, Inc. Dissociation constants were obtained from nonlinear regression analyses of the equilibrium binding data using a one-site homogeneous binding model and software contained in SlideWrite™ (version 2.1, Advanced Graphics, Inc., Carlsbad, CA). Association rate constants were obtained from nonlinear regression fits of the kinetic data to single exponential functions of time also using SlideWrite™. RNA was isolated from hybridoma cells with TRIzol reagent and enriched for poly(A+) RNA. First strand cDNA synthesis of the variable region was carried out with primers complementary to the 5′ end of the CH1 domain of the γ1 heavy chain or to the 5′ end of the Cκ domain of the light chain. The γ1-chain primer (GGCAGCACTAGTAGGGGCCAGTGGATA) was complementary to amino acids 122-126 of the CH1 domain and contained an SpeI site (underlined) at the 5′ end; the κ-chain primer (GAAGATCTAGACTTACTATGCAGCATCAGC) was complementary to residues 109-114 of the Cκ domain and contained an XbaI site (underlined) at the 5′ end for cloning. After cDNA synthesis, PCR amplification was carried out with the primers above and with consensus variable region primers (24Huse W. Sastry L. Iverson S. Kang A. Alting-Mees M. Burton D. Benkovic S.

The heavy chain variable region primer (AGGTCCAGCT(T,G)CTCGAGTCAGG) contained an XhoI restriction site (underlined) and the light chain variable region primer (CCAGTTCCGAGCTCGATGTTTTGATGACCCAAACTCCAC) contained a SacI site at the 5′ end. The products were cloned into Bluescript (Stratagene, La Jolla, Ca) and sequenced from both directions by the dideoxy chain termination method. Heavy and light chain models were constructed by sending the protein sequence to the Swiss-Model server (Automated knowledge-based protein modeling server at ExPASy). This server created a model including the complete light chain and heavy chain from framework 1 through framework 3. This is in accordance with the canonical structure theory (15Murzin A.G. Brenner S.E. Hubbard T. Chothia C. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 247: 536-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (5542) Google Scholar, 16Chothia C. Lesk A.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1987; 196: 901-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (1163) Google Scholar) since a limited number of canonical structures have been observed for all three CDRs in the light chain and CDR1 and CDR2 in the heavy chain. Since no set of canonical structures exists for CDR3 of the heavy chain (because of its variability), the CDR3 loop was built from a known structure with closest sequence homology. The sequence from amino acid 82 to the end of framework 4 was used to find an appropriate structure, using the program SCOP at Protein Data Bank (Brookhaven National Laboratories, Brookhaven, CT). The highest score in similarity with no gaps spanning the CDR3 region was obtained with the anti-2,4-dinitrophenol antibody An02 (Protein Data Bank code 1baf). The overall sequence similarity for the entire searched peptide was 77%, with 81% similarity in the framework 3 portion, 80% in framework 4, but only 34% in CDR3. The heavy chain model was completed by superpositioning the backbone atoms of conserved amino acid residues located in the framework 3 region in both structures. The superimposed residues included amino acids 86-94 with an 89% sequence similarity, resulting in a r.m.s. deviation of 0.3384 Å. Model completion and the final analysis were performed with the programs InsightII and Discover (Biosym Technologies, San Diego, CA) on a Silicon Graphics Onyx Extreme (Silicon Graphics Inc., Mountain View, CA). The initial model was energy-minimized to relax any constraints that may have been introduced during the building process. It was then superimposed onto the structure of monoclonal antibody CHA255, whose structure has been solved to 2.2-Å resolution (11Love R.A. Villafranca J.E. Aust R.M. Nakamura K.K. Jue R.A. Major J.G. Radhakrishnan R. Butler W.F. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 10950-10959Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Superpositioning of the heavy chain framework regions 1-3 gave a r.m.s. deviation of 0.7658 Å, whereas framework regions 1-3 of the light chain gave a r.m.s. deviation of 1.7992 Å, resulting in an overall r.m.s. deviation of 1.2838 Å. The overall sequence similarity between 2A81G5 and CHA255 is 63% for the heavy chain and 45% for the light chain. The possible antigen binding site of the 2A81G5 monoclonal antibody was examined by comparing the model with the structure of CHA255 bearing an indium-loaded EOTUBE tetraacetic acid in the binding pocket. The key residue for indium binding in the CHA255 antigen binding pocket, His-H95 (Kabat numbering (17Kabat E.A. Wu T.T. Reid-Miller M. Perry H.M. Gottesman K.S. Foeller C. Sequences of Proteins of Immunological Interest. National Institutes of Health, Bethesda1991Google Scholar)), and His-H96 in the present model were less than 0.5 Å apart; residue His-H96 was therefore considered important in the antigen recognition site of 2A81G5. The EOTUBE-cadmium complex was then put into the antigen binding site of the model. Due to the somewhat unfavorable r.m.s. value between the model and CHA255, the complex was slightly repositioned. This was done by calculating a docking grid for the model with the program Delphi (Biosym Technologies, San Diego, CA) and reorienting the ligand within the binding pocket according to minimum values in electrostatic and van der Waals interactions. The model was then energy-minimized and analyzed for possible interactions between His-H96 and the cadmium ion. A dynamics calculation was performed to simulate possible movements within the amino acid side chains, and the frame with the smallest His-H96-cadmium distance was minimized to a final maximum derivative of 0.01 kcal/Å. The model showed that a second His residue, in particular His-L27D (Kabat numbering), could be in close enough proximity to the metal cation to also be involved in the antigen-antibody interaction. To evaluate this possibility, a second model was built and investigated. The principal steps in model building were identical to those described above. In order to maximize possible interactions between the antigenic thioureido tail and the binding site on the antibody, the bond between the phenylic C atom and the attached N atom was rotated by approximately 180° prior to dynamics calculation. The cadmium-chelate complex of interest in this study was a low molecular weight hapten of insufficient size to elicit an immune response. For this reason, a bifunctional EDTA derivative previously shown to elicit an immune response in mice (4Reardan D.T. Meares C.F. Goodwin D.A. McTigue M. David G.S. Stone M.R. Leung J.P. Bartholomew R.M. Frincke J.M. Nature. 1985; 316: 265-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar) was loaded with cadmium and covalently conjugated to a large carrier protein, keyhole limpet hemocyanin. The resulting conjugate was injected multiple times into the peritoneal cavity of three BALB/c mice, and the presence of antibodies directed toward the cadmium-chelate complex was assessed by ELISA, as shown in Fig. 1. Sera from all three mice showed reactivity toward both a metal-free EDTA-BSA conjugate and a cadmium-loaded EDTA-BSA conjugate; however, only one of the three mice demonstrated a preferential binding to the cadmium-loaded conjugate. This mouse (Mouse 3) was given an additional intraperitoneal injection with Cd-EDTA-KLH in PBS, and its spleen was used 4 days later for the preparation of hybridoma cells. The hybridomas obtained after fusion with myeloma cells were initially screened by indirect ELISA for their ability to bind to Cd-EDTA-BSA. This preliminary screen yielded 49 positive clones; these clones were subsequently screened by competitive ELISA to identify those that synthesized antibodies with specificity for the cadmium ion present in the Cd-EDTA chelate complex. Supernatants from these 49 clones were tested for their ability to bind to adsorbed Cd-EDTA-BSA in the presence of soluble inhibitors, and the 49 clones could be separated into four general subtypes, as shown in Fig. 2. Eight of the clones showed a binding response similar to that of the clone designated 1D5. Although the antibodies synthesized by hybridoma 1D5 bound to Cd-EDTA-BSA, this binding could not be inhibited by 5 mM EDTA, 50 ppm cadmium in 5 mM EDTA, or 50 ppm zinc in 5 mM EDTA. It was concluded that the clones made antibodies directed primarily toward the benzyl group present in the linkage region between the EDTA and the carrier protein, and these hybridomas were not further characterized. A majority of the clones which passed the initial screen (33 of the original 49) showed a response in competitive ELISA similar to that of the clone designated 2E4. Antibody binding was strongly inhibited by 5 mM EDTA, as well as by soluble Cd-EDTA and Zn-EDTA complexes. Since the antibodies secreted by these clones appeared to be directed primarily toward the EDTA portion of the antigen, these hybridomas were also excluded from further analysis. Of the eight clones remaining from the original 49, three had characteristics similar to that of the clone designated 4F10. The antibodies secreted by this type of clone did not recognize metal-free EDTA even when this soluble antigen was present at concentrations as high as 5 mM. However, these clones were excluded from further analysis because their secreted antibodies could not distinguish between cadmium and zinc complexes of EDTA. The final five clones showed characteristics similar to that exemplified by 2A8. Addition of soluble 5 mM EDTA to the antibodies secreted by three out of five of these clones actually increased the strength of their interaction with immobilized Cd-EDTA-BSA. Soluble cadmium-EDTA complexes interacted strongly with these antibodies, whereas zinc-EDTA complexes showed minimal binding. Clone 2A8 was chosen for further experiments since this hybridoma had desirable growth characteristics and its supernatant showed the highest specific titer at limiting dilution (data not shown). Clone 2A8 was subcloned by limiting dilution; the subclone of interest (2A81G5) was found to secrete an antibody of the IgG1 kappa type. Monoclonal antibody purified from ascites fluid produced by mice injected with clone 2A81G5 contained 465 µg/ml protein and 404.5 µg/ml IgG1. The purified antibody (>85% pure) had a specific titer of 253,150/mg IgG1 when tested in indirect ELISA (data not shown). The binding specificity of the 2A81G5 monoclonal antibody was investigated by conducting equilibrium binding measurements with a variety of different metal ions and chelators. The extent of antibody binding was assessed by quantifying the free, unbound antibody remaining in equilibrium mixtures of free antibody, excess chelated metal, and antibody·metal-chelate complex using a KinExA™ immunoassay instrument. Unbound antibody was removed from each equilibrium mixture by rapid percolation of the mixture through a packed bed of microbeads charged with the immobilized epitope used to solicit the antibody.

Studies of synaptic vesicle protein interactions have both led to the identification of novel synaptic proteins and suggested hypotheses of protein function. Synaptic vesicle protein 2 (SV2), is an integral membrane glycoprotein present in all synaptic vesicles. There are two characterized isoforms, SV2A and SV2B. Despite their homology to transporter proteins, the function of the SV2s remains unknown. In an effort to determine SV2 function and identify cofactors required for SV2 activity, we examined the protein interactions of SV2 using a combination of cross-linking, immunoprecipitation, and recombinant protein affinity chromatography. We report that SV2 is part of a large protein complex that contains the synaptic vesicle protein synaptotagmin. The interaction between SV2 and synaptotagmin is direct, specific to SV2A, and inhibited by calcium with an EC50 of approximately 10 µM. Interaction is mediated by the cytoplasmic amino terminus of SV2A and the C2B domain of synaptotagmin. Our observations suggest a regulatory relationship between these two proteins.

Formation and dissociation of protein complexes in the synapse mediate and regulate the events of the synaptic vesicle cycle. The identification of synaptic protein interactions has both suggested hypotheses for the role each protein plays in neurotransmission and has provided evidence for mechanistic models of synaptic vesicle docking, priming, and fusion (1Südhof T.C.

The SV2 cDNAs predict 12 transmembrane domain proteins that have significant sequence homology to the major facilitator family of transporters (3Bajjalieh S.M. Peterson K. Shinghal R. Scheller R.H.

This family of small molecule transporters includes the vesicular transporters of amines and acetylcholine (7Linial M. Trends Biochem.

Based on this homology, the SV2s were initially hypothesized to be vesicular neurotransmitter transporters, with each isoform transporting a specific neurotransmitter. However, the expression of SV2A and SV2B does not correlate with neurotransmitter phenotype (8Bajjalieh S.M. Frantz G.D. Weimann J.M. McConnell S.K. Scheller R.H. J. Neurosci. 1994; 14: 5223-5235Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), therefore it is not likely that they serve this function. synaptic vesicle protein 2 dithiobis(succinimidyl propionate) Hepes-buffered saline incubation buffer polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. A current hypothesis of SV2 function is that it transports a constituent of synaptic vesicles other than neurotransmitters. However, attempts to demonstrate transport activity in SV2-expressing fibroblasts have been inconclusive, 2S. M. Bajjalieh, unpublished results. perhaps due to the absence of a cofactor required for SV2 function. Alternatively, the structural similarity of transporters and channels (9Jan L.Y. Jan Y.N. Cell. 1992; 69: 715-718Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar, 10Riordan J.R. Chang X.B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1101: 221-222Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) suggests that SV2 is either a vesicular ion channel or a component of the proposed proteinaceous fusion pore which mediates neurotransmitter release. To distinguish between these hypotheses of SV2 function, and to identify potential cofactors or regulators of SV2 activity, we examined the interaction of SV2 with other synaptic proteins. SV2 has previously been reported to co-immunoprecipitate with synaptic vesicle proteins, including synaptophysin and synaptotagmin (11Bennett M.K. Calakos N. Kreiner T. Scheller R.H. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 116: 761-775Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). However, SV2's interactions varied with the detergent used for solubilization, suggesting that detergents alter protein interactions. In order to circumvent problems associated with detergent solubilization, we have employed a combination of cross-linking, immunoprecipitation, and recombinant protein affinity chromatography to identify proteins that interact with SV2. We report that SV2 interacts with the synaptic vesicle protein synaptotagmin. This interaction is mediated by the cytosolic, amino terminus of SV2 and the second protein kinase C homology (C2B) domain of synaptotagmin. The interaction is isoform specific (SV2A but not SV2B interacts with synaptotagmin I) and is inhibited by calcium. These observations suggest that SV2 and synaptotagmin are cofactors in a calcium-regulated process and that the isoform-specificity of their interaction provides a mechanism for fine-tuning synaptic functioning. Cross-linking reagents were obtained from Pierce, protein A-Sepharose from Pharmacia Biotech Inc., glutathione-agarose from Sigma, and detergents from Boehringer-Mannheim. Antibodies directed against synaptotagmin I were the generous gift of Richard Scheller, Stanford University. Synaptotagmin I-glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion constructs were the generous gifts of Ken Miller and Richard Scheller, Stanford University and Zuhong Sheng, University of Washington. Anti-synaptophysin antibody was purchased from Boehringer-Mannheim. Synaptosomes were prepared as described by Huttner et al. (12Huttner W.B. Schiebler W. Greengard P. DeCammilli P. J. Cell Biol. 1983; 96: 1373-1388Crossref Scopus (894) Google Scholar). Briefly, fresh rat brains were homogenized 10 strokes using a glass-Teflon homogenizer with a 0.004-0.006-inch clearance in 10 mM Hepes, 0.3 M sucrose. The homogenate was centrifuged at 1000 × g for 10 min to remove nuclei and undisrupted cells, and the resulting supernatant was centrifuged for 13 min at 25,000 × g. The resulting pellet contains a crude synaptosome preparation which was washed once with Hepes-buffered saline (HBS) (10 mM Hepes, 142 mM NaCl, 2.4 mM KCl, 1 mM MgCl2, 5 mMD-glucose, 0.1 mM EGTA) or HEDTA incubation buffer (50 mM Hepes, 5 mM HEDTA, 95 mM KOAc, pH 7.5) and resuspended in same buffer. The protein content was assayed using either the Pierce BCA or Bio-Rad protein quantification reagents. Synaptosomes were used immediately after preparation. Crude synaptic vesicles were isolated from hypotonically ruptured synaptosomes as described previously (12Huttner W.B. Schiebler W. Greengard P. DeCammilli P. J. Cell Biol. 1983; 96: 1373-1388Crossref Scopus (894) Google Scholar). Briefly, synaptosomes were hypotonically lysed by a 1:9 dilution in water with rehomogenization. Heavy membranes (including plasma membrane) were removed by centrifuging 15,000 rpm in a Beckman S28 rotor for 16 min. Synaptic vesicles were isolated by centrifuging at 28,000 rpm in the same rotor for 4 h. Synaptic vesicle proteins were solubilized in 20 mM Hepes, 140 mM KOAc, 2% Triton X-100 for 2 h at 4°C, then dialyzed overnight against incubation buffer (IB) (20 mM Hepes, pH 7.2, 140 mM KOAc, 2 mM EGTA, 1.95 mM CaCl2, 1% Triton X-100, 1% glycerol; final calcium concentration = 5 µM). Insoluble protein was removed by centrifugation at 19,000 × g for 30 min, and the protein concentration was determined using the Pierce BCA protein assay reagent. Crude synaptosomes were suspended in HBS at room temperature at a final protein concentration of either 2 mg/ml (Fig. 1) or 5 mg/ml (Fig. 2). A 10% volume of water, Me2SO, or 25 mM dithiobis(succinimidyl propionate) (DSP) in Me2SO (final concentration 2.5 mM) was added, and the mixtures were incubated with gentle agitation at room temperature for 30 min. Reactions were terminated with the addition of 150 mM Tris to quench the cross-linking reagent, after which proteins were solubilized in 1% SDS for 2 h. Insoluble material was removed by centrifugation, at 19,000 × g for 15 min. Detergent extracts were either diluted in SDS-PAGE sample buffer and used in Western analyses or used in immunoprecipitations.Fig. 2Cross-linking increases the co-immunoprecipitation of SV2 with synaptotagmin. To determine whether SV2 and synaptotagmin are in the same protein complex, synaptotagmin was immunoprecipitated from control and cross-linked synaptosome preparations. After immunoprecipitation, the cross-linking reagent was cleaved by treatment with reducing agents. Co-precipitating proteins were identified by Western analysis. SV2, but not synaptophysin, co-immunoprecipitated with synaptotagmin. The amount of SV2 co-precipitating was greatly increased by previous cross-linking, suggesting that these two proteins interact in the synaptic vesicle membrane. SV2 co-precipitating with synaptotagmin under control conditions suggests either that the interaction is SDS-resistant, or, more likely, that the interaction re-forms upon dilution in Triton X-100. The left lane contains solubilized synaptosome protein as a positive control in the Western analysis. Control experiments were run concurrently to demonstrate that SV2 does not precipitate with either protein A-Sepharose or antibody alone (not shown).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) 500 µg of total cross-linked or uncross-linked synaptosome protein was diluted in 1 ml of HKA (10 mM Hepes, 140 mM KOAc, 1 mM MgCl2, 0.1 mM EGTA) with 0.1% bovine serum albumin, 0.1% gelatin, and 2% Triton X-100. Buffer or a polyclonal antibody directed against the cytoplasmic domain of synaptotagmin I was added and mixtures were incubated with gentle agitation for 1 h at 4°C. Protein A Sepharose was prepared by swelling in water, washing with HKA, and blocking with 0.1% bovine serum albumin and 0.1% gelatin in HKA at 4°C for 2 h. Antibody-protein complexes were isolated using 30 µl of 50% (v/v) protein A-Sepharose beads added to the reactions and incubated for another hour at 4°C. Beads were washed three times in HKA with 2% Triton X-100, resuspended in 20 µl of SDS-PAGE sample buffer with 2-mercaptoethanol (which cleaves the cross-linking reagent), incubated for 1 h at room temperature, after which the eluate was collected. Eluates were heated to 65°C for 2 min, separated by SDS-PAGE (13Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207538) Google Scholar), and subjected to Western analysis. cDNAs containing the amino-terminal regions of SV2A and SV2B were amplified by polymerase chain reaction using primers containing restriction enzyme sites compatible with subcloning into the expression vector PGEX-KT (14Hakes D.J. Dixon J.E. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 202: 293-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). All constructs were sequenced to verify that they contained the correct sequence in frame with GST. Plasmids were grown in either XL1-MRF′ or BL26 strains of Escherichia coli. Protein production was induced with addition of 100 µM isopropyl-1-thio-β-D-galactopyranoside for 3-5 h at 37°C. Bacteria were resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline, 2 mM EDTA, 0.1% 2-mercaptoethanol, and 200 µM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and lysed by sonication. Proteins were solubilized in 0.5% Tween 20, followed by centrifugation to clear lysates. Fusion proteins were isolated by glutathione-agarose chromatography, separated by SDS-PAGE, and detected by Western analysis or Coomassie Blue staining. Approximately 1 µg of the indicated fusion protein was bound to 10 µl of 50% (v/v) glutathione-agarose beads and suspended in 1 ml of IB with 100 µg of solubilized crude synaptic vesicle protein. Reactions were incubated for 1 h at 4°C, washed five times in 1 ml of cold IB, after which beads were resuspended in 30 µl of SDS-PAGE sample buffer heated to 65°C for 10 min, and the eluate was collected and subjected to Western analysis. Synaptotagmin GST fusion protein corresponding to the entire cytoplasmic domain (construct 1-5) was isolated by glutathione-agarose bead chromatography followed by thrombin cleavage. Excess phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (100-1000 µM) was added to the purified peptide to block further action of thrombin. For binding assays, purified synaptotagmin peptide was incubated at a 3:1 molar ratio with approximately 1 µg of GST, SV2AN, or SV2BN in 1 ml of IB. Beads were washed five times with 200 µl of IB, resuspended in 20 µl of 2 × sample buffer, and heated to 65°C. The eluate was resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose. GST fusion proteins were identified in blots by Ponceau S staining to verify that equal amounts were present in all reactions. Synaptotagmin peptide was detected by Western analysis. Approximately 1 µg of GST fusion protein bound to glutathione-agarose beads was incubated for 1 h with 200 µg of Triton X-100-solubilized synaptosome protein in HEDTA buffer (50 mM Hepes, 5 mM HEDTA, 95 mM KOAc, pH 7.5) with the indicated free calcium concentrations. Free calcium concentrations were estimated using the Maxchelator program. After binding, beads were washed five times with 1 ml of buffer containing the same free calcium concentration as that used for incubation. Proteins were eluted in SDS-PAGE sample buffer, resolved by SDS-PAGE, and transferred to nitrocellulose. Fusion peptides were visualized by Ponceau staining, and SV2 was visualized by Western analysis utilizing either ECL or 125I-labeled secondary antibody. 125I-Labeled samples were quantified by PhosphorImager analysis. To identify in situ interactions of SV2 with other synaptic proteins, we utilized the lipid-soluble, cleavable, homobifunctional cross-linking reagent DSP (Pierce). Initial experiments, using fresh rat synaptosome preparations, analyzed the effects of cross-linking on the migration of SV2 in nonreducing SDS-PAGE gels. Following treatment with DSP, approximately 50% of the SV2 shifted from its normal migration at 70-85 kDa to the top of the gel (Fig. 1), suggesting that SV2 is part of a large protein complex. Similar results were obtained by treating a crude synaptic vesicle preparation with the water-soluble cross-linking reagent 3,3′-dithiobis(sulfosuccinimidyl propionate) (data not shown), which suggests that SV2's interactions are mediated by its cytoplasmic domains. Due to the size of the SV2 complex, we could not determine its molecular weight on polyacrylamide gels. To estimate its mass, we separated cross-linked from uncross-linked SV2 by glycerol gradient velocity separation and resolved the fractions by agarose-gel electrophoresis. Using this method, we observed multiple SV2-containing complexes. The three major ones were approximately 250, 800, and >800 kDa (data not shown). To begin to identify the components of the SV2 complex, we analyzed cross-linked synaptosome preparations for two proteins previously reported to co-immunoprecipitate with SV2, synaptophysin and synaptotagmin (11Bennett M.K. Calakos N. Kreiner T. Scheller R.H. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 116: 761-775Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Fig. 1 demonstrates that synaptotagmin, like SV2, migrates on SDS-PAGE as a large molecular weight complex after cross-linking, whereas synaptophysin does not. Nearly all of the synaptotagmin appears to be cross-linked following DSP treatment, compared to approximately 50% of the SV2, suggesting either that SV2 is present in excess to synaptotagmin, or that synaptotagmin is also part of other protein complexes that do not contain SV2. Synaptotagmin also co-migrated with SV2 in agarose-gel separations of cross-linked samples, providing further evidence that the two proteins are in the same complex (not shown). As stated, synaptophysin did not co-migrate with SV2 after cross-linking. We did observe anti-synaptophysin immunoreactive bands of approximately 56 and 76 kDa, which confirmed previous reports of synaptophysin interactions with itself and the 18-kDa synaptic vesicle protein VAMP (15Rehm H. Wiedenmann B. Betz H. EMBO J. 1986; 5: 535-541Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar, 16Calakos N. Scheller R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24534-24537Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Edelmann L. Hanson P.I. Chapman E.R. Jahn R. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 224-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar). Both synaptotagmin and synaptophysin are major protein constituents of the synaptic vesicle (18Wiedenmann B. Lawley K. Grund C. Branton D. J. Cell Biol. 1985; 101: 12-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 19Wendland B. Miller K.G. Schilling J. Scheller R.H. Neuron. 1991; 6: 993-1007Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). The selectivity of the co-migration of SV2 with synaptotagmin and not synaptophysin suggests that treatment with DSP does not randomly cross-link SV2 to major synaptic vesicle proteins, but rather that cross-linking reflects associations present in the vesicle membrane. To determine whether SV2 and synaptotagmin are in the same protein complex, we asked whether cross-linking affects co-immunoprecipitation of the two proteins. Synaptosomes, treated with vehicle or cross-linking reagent, were solubilized in 1% SDS to disrupt interactions not secured by cross-linking. The resulting extract was diluted 10-fold in 1% Triton X-100 and used in immunoprecipitation experiments employing an antibody directed against the cytoplasmic portion of synaptotagmin I. Western analyses of precipitates (treated with reducing agents to cleave the cross-linking reagent) revealed that cross-linking significantly increases the co-immunoprecipitation of SV2 with synaptotagmin (Fig. 2). As a control, we probed for synaptophysin, which does not co-migrate in SDS-PAGE gels with either SV2 or synaptotagmin after cross-linking. Synaptophysin did not precipitate with synaptotagmin under either condition. The co-immunoprecipitation of a small amount of SV2 with synaptotagmin from uncross-linked samples suggests either that a proportion of the SV2-synaptotagmin complex is resistant to SDS, or, more likely, that the interaction is re-forming in Triton X-100 upon dilution of the SDS. In similar experiments with anti-SV2 antibodies we found that we could not immunoprecipitate the SV2 complex (not shown). These observations suggest that SV2's interactions are mediated by its amino terminus, which contains the epitopes recognized by available anti-SV2 antibodies. SV2 contains two large cytoplasmic domains that could mediate its interactions with other proteins, an amino-terminal region and a loop between the 6th and 7th transmembrane domains (3Bajjalieh S.M. Peterson K. Shinghal R. Scheller R.H. Science. 1992; 257: 1271-1273Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Based on the observation that antibodies directed against the amino terminus do not immunoprecipitate the SV2 complex, we predicted that this region of SV2 mediates at least some of its interactions with other proteins. To test if SV2's amino terminus is sufficient for interaction with synaptotagmin and to determine whether the interaction is direct, we assayed the binding of synaptotagmin to SV2-GST fusion proteins encoding the amino-terminal cytoplasmic domain of both SV2A and SV2B. The ability of native synaptotagmin to bind SV2 amino-terminal peptides was tested by incubating extracts of crude synaptic vesicle preparations with GST-SV2 peptides attached to glutathione-agarose beads followed by Western analysis of bound material. Synaptotagmin bound the SV2A but not the SV2B peptide (Fig. 3A). This indicates 1) that the interaction is isoform-specific and 2) that the amino terminus of SV2 is sufficient to mediate interaction with synaptotagmin. While these results suggest that SV2 and synaptotagmin interact, it remained possible that the observed interaction is mediated by another synaptic protein present in synaptic vesicle extracts. To resolve this issue, we asked whether recombinant protein fragments corresponding to the cytoplasmic domain of synaptotagmin I would bind GST-SV2 amino-terminal peptides. Fig. 3B shows that recombinant synaptotagmin I does bind directly to SV2A peptide. As with native synaptotagmin, the recombinant synaptotagmin peptide did not bind SV2B. These results indicate that SV2A interacts directly with synaptotagmin via SV2's amino-terminal cytoplasmic domain. Synaptotagmin has been reported to interact with a number of molecules including syntaxin (20Li C. Ullrich B. Zhang J.Z. Anderson R.G.W. Brose N. Südhof T.C.

Chem. 1996; 271: 1262-1265Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). With the exception of neurexin, all of these proteins interact with synaptotagmin via one of its two protein kinase C homology (C2) domains. To determine which region of synaptotagmin mediates its interaction with SV2, we analyzed the binding of native SV2 to several synaptotagmin I-GST fusion constructs (diagrammed in Fig. 4A). We observed that native SV2 binds peptides containing the C2B domain (Fig. 4B). To be certain that the C2A domain does not interact with SV2, we employed multiple, slightly different C2A peptides. None of them bound SV2. While it remains possible that SV2 interacts with synaptotagmin via its carboxyl terminus (region 5), which was present in the C2B peptides, the effects of calcium on the interaction (see below) suggest that the calcium-binding C2 domain is involved (region 4). The binding of native and recombinant synaptotagmin to recombinant SV2A, but not SV2B, suggests that the interaction is specific to SV2A. To confirm this, we analyzed the binding of native SV2 to recombinant synaptotagmin I using isoform-specific anti-SV2A and anti-SV2B antibodies (8Bajjalieh S.M. Frantz G.D. Weimann J.M. McConnell S.K. Scheller R.H. J. Neurosci. 1994; 14: 5223-5235Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These experiments revealed that only SV2A binds synaptotagmin (Fig. 4C). Even at long exposure times, there was no evidence of SV2B binding (not shown). This result supports the conclusion that SV2 interacts with synaptotagmin in an isoform-specific manner. Both C2 domains of synaptotagmin contain a novel calcium binding motif (28Sutton R.B. Daveltov B.A. Berghuis A.M. Südhof T.C. Sprang S.R. Cell. 1995; 80: 929-938Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (606) Google Scholar) and both demonstrate calcium-dependent interactions (21Kee Y. Scheller R.H. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 1975-1981Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 27Sugita S. Hata Y. Südhof T.C. J. Biol.

Chem. 1993; 268: 26386-26390Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To determine if the SV2A-synaptotagmin interaction is calcium-dependent, we examined the effects of various calcium concentrations on the binding of native SV2 to the C2B domain of synaptotagmin. Fig. 5 demonstrates that increasing calcium concentrations inhibit binding with an EC50 of approximately 10 µM. This result suggests that the SV2-synaptotagmin interaction is regulated by a calcium sensor. Since SV2 does not appear to be a calcium-binding protein (6Bajjalieh S.M. Peterson K. Linial M. Scheller R.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 2150-2154Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar), this regulation is most likely mediated by calcium-induced conformational changes in synaptotagmin (30Davletov B.A. Südhof T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28547-28550Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of a calcium-induced dissociation of synaptotagmin from another molecule. We have characterized an interaction between two proteins common to all synaptic vesicles, SV2 and synaptotagmin. This interaction is direct, specific to SV2A, mediated by the amino terminus of SV2 and the C2B domain of synaptotagmin, and is inhibited by calcium with an EC50 of approximately 10 µM. The amino terminus of SV2 is sufficient to mediate interaction with synaptotagmin in vitro. This region contains the lowest sequence similarity between SV2A and SV2B and is therefore the region most likely to mediate isoform-specific interactions. However, we cannot rule out that in vivo interactions also utilize other regions of SV2. SV2 contains a large cytoplasmic loop between its 6th and 7th membrane domains which could play a role in protein interactions. Because we were unable to generate sufficient amounts of full-length recombinant peptides corresponding to this region, we did not test its interactions with synaptotagmin. Interactions could also utilize the transmembrane domains of SV2. Nevertheless, two observations indicate that the amino terminus mediates part, if not all, of SV2's interaction with synaptotagmin: 1) the amino terminus of SV2 binds synaptotagmin in vitro with the same isoform specificity as native protein and 2) antibodies directed against the amino terminus of SV2 do not precipitate the SV2 complex. The experiments reported here utilized peptides corresponding to, or antibodies directed against, synaptotagmin I. Therefore, while we can conclude that synaptotagmin I interacts preferentially with SV2A, we do not know whether other isoforms of synaptotagmin also interact with SV2A or preferentially with SV2B. Experiments measuring the binding of native synaptotagmin II to the amino terminus of SV2A and SV2B suggest that this isoform of synaptotagmin binds both isoforms of SV2, although with much lower affinity than the synaptotagmin I-SV2A interaction (not shown). These results suggest that isoform specificity in both binding partners could mediate subtle differences in synaptic functioning. Our study adds to a growing collection that demonstrates potentially important interactions involving the C2B domain of synaptotagmin. C2B interacts with a number of molecules, including clathrin AP2 (24Zhang J.Z. Davletov B.A. Südhof T.C. Anderson R.G.W. Cell. 1994; 78: 751-760Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar), high inositol polyphosphates (25Niinobe M. Yamaguchi Y. Fukuda M. Mikoshiba K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 205: 1036-1042Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), phospholipids (31Fukuda M. Aruga J. Niinobe M. Aimoto S. Mikoshiba K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29206-29211Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), B-SNAP (26Schiavo G. Gmachi M.J.S. Stenbeck G. Sollner T.H. Rothman J.E. Nature. 1995; 378: 733-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar), and syntaxin (20Li C. Ullrich B. Zhang J.Z. Anderson R.G.W. Brose N. Südhof T.C. Nature. 1995; 375: 594-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (541) Google Scholar, 21Kee Y. Scheller R.H. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 1975-1981Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These interactions are calcium-independent. However, C2B does contain the C2-key calcium binding motif (28Sutton R.B. Daveltov B.A. Berghuis A.M. Südhof T.C. Sprang S.R. Cell. 1995; 80: 929-938Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (606) Google Scholar) and has recently been shown to mediate homo-oligomerization of synaptotagmin at high calcium concentrations (27Sugita S. Hata Y. Südhof T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1262-1265Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). In addition, the C2B domain may be important functionally. Microinjection of peptides corresponding to a region of the C2B domain were more efficacious in disrupting neurotransmission in the squid giant synapse than peptides corresponding to the analogous region of the C2A domain (32Bommert K. Charlton M.P. DeBello W.M. Chin G.J. Betz H. Augustine G.J. Nature. 1993; 363: 163-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). Furthermore, mice in which synaptotagmin has been disrupted in the C2B domain lack the fast, low calcium-affinity component of regulated secretion (33Geppert M. Goda Y. Hammer R.E. Li C. Rosahl T.W. Stevens C.F. Südhof T.C. Cell. 1994; 79: 717-727Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1223) Google Scholar), suggesting that the C2B domain may mediate synaptotagmin's role as a low affinity calcium sensor. The SV2-synaptotagmin interaction may provide calcium-regulated modulation of one or both proteins' actions. There are at least three ways in which this interaction may function. First, synaptotagmin may regulate a transporter or channel function of SV2. This model predicts that association with synaptotagmin either inhibits or promotes transport by SV2, with reversal of this regulation at high calcium concentrations during exocytosis. Interestingly, expression of synaptotagmin's C2B domain transforms an endogenous choline transport activity in Xenopus oocytes to one with the characteristics of neuronal choline transporters, indicating that C2B domains can regulate transporters (34O'Regan S. Birman S. Meunier F. Mol. Brain Res. 1995; 32: 135-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). Moreover, the effect of C2B on transport activity in this system was eliminated by high calcium concentrations, a result which parallels the calcium effects we see in the SV2-synaptotagmin interaction. In the synapse, synaptotagmin may activate SV2-mediated transport of a common vesicle constituent during resting conditions. With calcium influx, the proteins dissociate, turning off SV2 activity during exocytosis and recycling. A variation of this model incorporates another hypothesized function of SV2; that it serves as a component of the fusion pore that mediates the initial events of transmitter release. In this model, synaptotagmin, via its interactions with SNARE proteins, would regulate targeting of SV2 to its counterpart in the plasma membrane. This model is consistent with synaptotagmin's proposed role as a calcium-regulated inhibitor of synaptic transmission (35Nonet M.L. Grundahl K. Meyer B.J. Rand J.B. Cell. 1993; 73: 1291-1305Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar, 36Martin K.C. Hu Y. Armitage B.A. Siegelbaum S.A. Kandel E.R. Kaang B-K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 11307-11311Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 37Morimoto T. Popov S. Buckley K.M. Poo M. Neuron. 1995; 15: 689-696Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). It suggests that synaptotagmin provides a “dock and hold” mechanism for the placement of SV2. This hypothesis is also consistent with the observation that synaptotagmin knockout mice lack the fast component of transmitter release. SV2 in these mice would not be ushered to the proper region of the plasma membrane, therefore fusion pore preassembly would be absent. An alternative model is one in which SV2 regulates the action of synaptotagmin, perhaps as a function secondary to its activity as a transporter. Precedent for this hypothesis comes from two observations: 1) ATP-binding cassette transporters have regulatory functions, in addition to their transport activity, that appear to be mediated by protein-protein interactions (38Higgins C.F. Cell. 1995; 82: 693-696Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar) and 2) synaptophysin, which is predicted to have channel or transport activity (39Thomas L. Hartung K. Langosch D. Rehm H. Bamberg E. Franke W.W. Betz H. Science. 1988; 242: 1050-1053Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar), binds VAMP in an interaction hypothesized to regulate the availability of VAMP to bind other proteins (16Calakos N. Scheller R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24534-24537Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Edelmann L. Hanson P.I. Chapman E.R. Jahn R. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 224-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar). In this model of SV2-synaptotagmin interaction, SV2 inhibits the availability of synaptotagmin to form protein complexes that mediate synaptic vesicle fusion until calcium concentrations rise in response to membrane depolarization. Identification of the other protein components of the SV2 complexes will help distinguish between these models. For example, if proteins implicated in vesicle fusion are found in the SV2 complex, it will support the hypothesis that SV2 is a component of the fusion machinery. Alternatively, if all SV2 complexes contain simply various stoichiometric ratios of SV2 and synaptotagmin, it will suggest that one or both of the proteins' functions is regulated by their association. In addition, the discovery of novel proteins in the SV2 complex would contribute to our understanding of both SV2 and synaptotagmin function. In conclusion, we have presented evidence implicating SV2 and synaptotagmin in a regulatory interaction. Our results provide further evidence for the functional importance of the second C2 domain of synaptotagmin and demonstrate that calcium-induced conformational changes of synaptotagmin mediate both protein association and dissociation.

We have studied the chaperone-like activity of α-crystallin toward heat-induced aggregation of bovine and human carbonic anhydrase. Human carbonic anhydrase aggregates at 60°C, while bovine carbonic anhydrase does not aggregate significantly at this temperature. Removal of the enzyme-bound metal ion, Zn2+, by EDTA modulates the aggregation behavior of bovine carbonic anhydrase. Fluorescence and circular dichroism studies show that removal of the metal ion from the bovine carbonic anhydrase by a chelator such as EDTA enhances the propensity of the enzyme to adopt the molten-globule state. α-Crystallin binds to this state of the enzyme and prevents aggregation. Fluorescence and circular dichroism studies on the α-crystallin-enzyme complexes show that the enzymes in the complex are in the molten-globule state.

Finally, by examining in parallel both SERCA2a and SERCA2b isoforms, in terms of activity and expression, we could determine that PDGF-induced stimulation of total SERCA activity (detected by formation of the phosphorylated intermediate, E∼P) and of SERCA2a expression (Western blotting) were abolished when extracellular Ca2+ entry was prevented by SR 33805. This study demonstrates that SERCA2a up-regulation is: 1) related to the G1/S transition step of cell cycle and 2) dependent on Ca2+ entry during PDGF-induced SMC proliferation. The role of Ca2+ influx in the regulation of the sarco-endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ATPases (SERCA) associated with intracellular Ca2+ pools was investigated during smooth muscle cell (SMC) proliferation induced by platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF). We first defined that the previously described up-regulation of the SERCA2a isoform found in vascular SMC after a 24-h stimulation with PDGF (Magnier, C., Papp, B., Corvazier, E., Bredoux, R., Wuytack, F., Eggermont, F., Maclouf, J., and Enouf, J. (1992) J. Biol. Chem. 267, 15808-15815) was precisely associated with SMC entry into S phase as it appeared linked with [3H]thymidine incorporation. This was further confirmed by testing the effect of transforming growth factor-β1, which inhibited both aortic SMC proliferation associated with G1 cell cycle arrest and PDGF-induced SERCA2a up-stimulation. Then, we tested the role of Ca2+ influx by using SR 33805, a new Ca2+ channel blocker, which was characterized with regard to the voltage Ca2+ channel blocker nifedipine and the capacitative entry Ca2+ blocker SKF 96365.

Chinese hamster ovary cell lines stably expressing wild-type CFTR or mutant G970R-CFTR yielded polypeptides with apparent masses of 170 kDa as the major products, whereas the major products of mutants S945L-CFTR and H949Y-CFTR had apparent masses of 150 kDa. The 150-kDa forms of CFTR were sensitive to endoglycosidase H digestion, indicating that these mutations interfered with maturation of the protein. Increased levels of mature CFTR (170 kDa) could be obtained for mutant H949Y when cells were grown at a lower temperature (26°C) or incubated in the presence of 10% glycerol. For all mutants, the open probability (P0) of the CFTR channels was significantly altered. S945L-CFTR and G970R-CFTR showed a severe reduction in the P0, whereas the H949Y mutation doubled the P0 relative to wild-type. The changes in P0 predominantly resulted from an alteration of the mean burst durations which suggests that CL3 is involved in obtaining and/or maintaining stability of the open state. In addition, mutants S945L and G970R had current-voltage relationships that were not completely linear over the range ±80 mV, but showed slight outward rectification. The fact that CL3 mutations can have subtle effects on channel conductance indicates that this region may be physically close to the inner mouth of the pore.

The immunosuppressive agent, cyclosporin A, blocked both cytokine induction and NGF-activated survival promotion but not survival promotion activated by IL-3 or stem cell factor, suggesting that NGF enhanced RPMC survival by increasing cytokine production. We also examine the effects of NGF on the expression levels of some members of the bcl-2 family and the interleukin-1β-converting enzyme-like cysteine protease families.

INTRODUCTIONAs a safeguard against the occurrence of DNA damage prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells have developed at least three different DNA repair mechanisms. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae DNA double strand breaks are repaired mainly by the activities of the RAD52 epistasis group (1Friedberg E.C. Walker G.C. Siede W. DNA Repair and Mutagenesis.

An evolutionary conservation of DNA double strand break pathways is suggested by the existence of eukaryotic homologues of S. cerevisiae DNA repair genes in this epistasis group (3Shinohara A.

The human Ku protein is a heterodimer composed of 70- and 80-kDa subunits (16Reeves W.H. Sthoeger Z.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 5047-5052Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The Drosophila homologue of the human Ku protein, IRBP (17Beall E.L. Admon A. Rio D.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 12681-12685Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), has been shown to be involved in repair of DNA double strand breaks, too, indicating a conservation of repair functions in Drosophila and mammals (18Beall E.L.

Ku p80 is not detectable in x-ray-sensitive xrs hamster cell lines known to be defective in normal V(D)J recombination processes (12Rathmell W.K. Chu G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 7623-7627Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar, 13Getts R.C. Stamato T.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15981-15984Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Both mutant phenotypes in these hamster cells can be complemented by the human XRCC5 gene encoding Ku p80 (11Smider V. Rathmell W.K. Lieber M.R. Chu G. Science. 1994; 266: 288-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). Cells derived from mice with severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) have been shown to be sensitive for ionizing radiation and defective in V(D)J recombination. For these SCID cells the catalytic subunit of the DNA-dependent protein kinase is a strong candidate for the afflicted gene (14Kirchgessner C.U. Patil C.K. Evans J.W. Cuomo C.A. Fried L.M. Carter T.

A number of DNA-binding proteins, including human p53, have been identified as targets of the DNA-dependent protein kinase (27Lees-Miller S.P. Chen Y. Anderson C.W. Mol. Cell.

Trans. 1993; 21: 930-935Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The DNA-dependent protein kinase and its regulatory subunit, Ku, may, therefore, play a key role in the signaling pathway of DNA damage (29Anderson C.W. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1993; 18: 433-437Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar).It was shown recently that the Ku heterodimer and human RAD51 coelute with the largest subunit of RNA polymerase II (30Maldanado E.

Moreover, DNA polymerase ϵ, which is involved in DNA repair synthesis (31Aboussekhra A. Biggerstaff M. Shivji M.K.K. Vilpo J.A. Moncollin V. Podust V.N. Protic M. Hübscher U. Egly J.-M. Wood R.D.

FASEB J. 1995; 9: A1398Google Scholar), is a component of this RNA polymerase II complex (30Maldanado E. Shiekhattar R. Sheldon M. Cho H. Drapkin R. Rickert P. Lees E. Anderson C.W. Linn S. Reinberg D. Nature. 1996; 381: 86-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar).A DNA-dependent protein kinase has not yet been described in S. cerevisiae. However, a yeast homologue of the human Ku heterodimer, a high affinity DNA binding factor (HDF), 1The abbreviations used are: HDFhigh affinity DNA binding factorMMSmethyl methanesulfonatebpbase pair(s). has been identified (33Feldmann H.M. Winnacker E.-L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12895-12900Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). HDF is a heterodimeric protein binding to the ends of double-stranded DNA. The gene of the 70-kDa subunit, HDF1, has been cloned, and the predicted amino acid sequences share significant homology with the 70-kDa subunit of the human Ku protein (33Feldmann H.M.

Feldmann H.M. Winnacker E.-L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7910-7915Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), an agent causing DNA double strand breaks (35D'Andrea A.D.

The disruption of the HDF1 gene also affects mating-type switching and spontaneous mitotic recombination (34Mages G.J. Feldmann H.M. Winnacker E.-L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7910-7915Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). hdf1 rad52 double mutant strains show an increased sensitivity toward ionizing radiation (38Siede W. Friedl A.A. Dianova I. Eckardt-Schupp F. Friedberg E.C. Genetics. 1996; 142: 91-102Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). HDF1 has been shown also to be involved in illegitimate recombination (39Tsukamoto Y. Kato J. Ikeda Hideo Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 2067-2072Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Another phenotype, which may not be related to the DNA repair activities of HDF, is the formation of substantially shorter telomeres in hdf1 mutant strains and a synthetic interaction of the hdf1 mutation with tel1 mutation, resulting in strains that grow slowly and have very short telomeres (40Porter S.E. Greenwell P.W. Ritchie K.B. Petes T.D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 582-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar).Here we show the cloning of HDF2, the second subunit of the HDF heterodimer. HDF2 displays significant homology to human Ku p80, comparable to the homology of HDF1 with Ku p70. While HDF1 does not bind DNA by itself, the HDF2 protein on its own displays DNA binding activity. Disruption of the hdf2 gene causes a temperature-sensitive phenotype for growth. This temperature sensitivity cannot be complemented by expression of the human Ku protein. hdf2 mutant strains are also sensitive toward bleomycin and methyl methane sulfonate but in comparison with hdf1 mutant strain this sensitivity is reduced.DISCUSSIONWe have cloned HDF2 from S. cerevisiae, the gene encoding the second subunit of the HDF heterodimer, which is the homologue of the human Ku protein. HDF2 displays a homology of 45.6% with Ku p80. The molecular mass predicted from the sequence of the HDF2 gene is 71.25 kDa. This is substantially smaller than the mass of the Ku p80 subunit of 82.5 kDa. The significance, if any, of the observed differences in the molecular masses of the two proteins remains unresolved as homology comparisons do not provide any indications for the presence of regional or local decreases in the homology of the two proteins.No DNA binding activity is detectable for HDF1 on its own. The analysis of extracts of hdf1-deficient cells reveals the presence of a weak DNA binding activity which is not detectable in extracts of hdf2-deficient cell. This DNA binding activity is also absent in cells of a double mutant strain but it can be restored by expression of a HDF2 gene from a single copy plasmid. These experiments indicate that HDF2 protein possesses a weak DNA binding activity of its own. Since the DNA binding activity of HDF2 alone is weak compared with the DNA binding activity of the heterodimer it may well be that HDF2 is the DNA binding subunit of the HDF heterodimer, while HDF1 is increasing the affinity of the heterodimer to DNA.hdf2 mutant strains are temperature-sensitive for growth. Cells grown at 37°C display the same phenotype as observed for hdf1 mutant cells, arresting as enlarged single-budded cells. hdf1 hdf2 double mutant strains display no additional growth defects. These results indicate that this phenotype depends on the missing HDF heterodimer activity.The temperature-sensitive phenotype for growth caused by HDF deficiency cannot be complemented by the expression of either the single subunits or the heterodimeric human Ku protein. A HDF/Ku corresponding DNA binding activity is not detectable in hdf1- or hdf2-deficient strains transformed with plasmids expressing human Ku p70 or Ku p80, respectively. These results indicate that HDF1 and Ku p80 or HDF2 and Ku p70 cannot form functional heterodimers. Functional expression of the Ku heterodimer can be shown by detection of the DNA binding activity of the Ku protein in crude yeast extract. We suggest therefore that loss of HDF DNA binding is not responsible for temperature sensitivity but loss of protein-protein interactions. It appears that human Ku cannot take over the function of HDF in protein-protein complexes. One candidate for protein interaction with the HDF heterodimer is the catalytic subunit of a postulated DNA-dependent protein kinase. Until now it was not possible to show the existence of a DNA-dependent protein kinase in yeast. But the functional and structural homology of HDF and Ku heterodimers leads to the assumption that a DNA-dependent protein kinase activity exists in S. cerevisiae, as well.We have shown recently that hdf1 mutant strains are sensitive for the radiomimetic agent bleomycin and, in addition, show a reduced rate of mating-type switching and mitotic recombination (34Mages G.J. Feldmann H.M. Winnacker E.-L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7910-7915Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). These experiments indicate that the HDF heterodimer is involved in DNA repair and recombination events. In this communication we show that hdf2-deficient strains are also sensitive to bleomycin and that hdf1- or hdf2-deficient strains are sensitive to MMS, an agent inducing DNA breaks. Surprisingly hdf1 mutant strains are about 10 times more sensitive toward both agents than hdf2 mutant strains. Deletion of both subunits in hdf1 hdf2 double mutant strains only slightly increases sensitivities. This observation indicates that HDF1 is the critical component of HDF heterodimers functioning in DNA repair. In conjunction with the data reported for the DNA binding activity of the HDF2 subunit, these results suggest a mechanistic model of the function of the HDF heterodimer. It may be that HDF2 is the DNA-binding component of the HDF heterodimer, while HDF1 is stabilizing the protein-DNA complex and is the active component in forming protein-protein complexes. In this case the HDF1 subunit alone could function in DNA repair but in a reduced manner. It may be that binding of the HDF heterodimer to DNA localizes the protein toward the position it is needed, and in hdf2-deficient cells the HDF1 subunit reaches this position only with a strongly reduced affinity. INTRODUCTIONAs a safeguard against the occurrence of DNA damage prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells have developed at least three different DNA repair mechanisms. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae DNA double strand breaks are repaired mainly by the activities of the RAD52 epistasis group (1Friedberg E.C. Walker G.C. Siede W. DNA Repair and Mutagenesis.

An evolutionary conservation of DNA double strand break pathways is suggested by the existence of eukaryotic homologues of S. cerevisiae DNA repair genes in this epistasis group (3Shinohara A.

The human Ku protein is a heterodimer composed of 70- and 80-kDa subunits (16Reeves W.H. Sthoeger Z.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 5047-5052Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The Drosophila homologue of the human Ku protein, IRBP (17Beall E.L. Admon A. Rio D.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 12681-12685Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), has been shown to be involved in repair of DNA double strand breaks, too, indicating a conservation of repair functions in Drosophila and mammals (18Beall E.L. Rio D.C. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 921-933Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar).The notion that Ku protein may participate in recombination, replication, or DNA repair events (19Mimori T.

Fewell J.W. Kuff E.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10546-10552Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Several lines of evidence appear to corroborate this view. Ku p80 is not detectable in x-ray-sensitive xrs hamster cell lines known to be defective in normal V(D)J recombination processes (12Rathmell W.K. Chu G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 7623-7627Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar, 13Getts R.C. Stamato T.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15981-15984Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Both mutant phenotypes in these hamster cells can be complemented by the human XRCC5 gene encoding Ku p80 (11Smider V. Rathmell W.K. Lieber M.R. Chu G. Science. 1994; 266: 288-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). Cells derived from mice with severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) have been shown to be sensitive for ionizing radiation and defective in V(D)J recombination. For these SCID cells the catalytic subunit of the DNA-dependent protein kinase is a strong candidate for the afflicted gene (14Kirchgessner C.U. Patil C.K. Evans J.W. Cuomo C.A. Fried L.M. Carter T. Oettinger M.A. Brown J.M. Science. 1995; 267: 1178-1182Crossref PubMed Scopus (587) Google Scholar, 15Lees-Miller S.P. Godbout R. Chan D.W. Weinfeld M. Day III, R.S. Barron G.M. Allalunis-Turner J. Science. 1995; 267: 1183-1185Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar). A number of DNA-binding proteins, including human p53, have been identified as targets of the DNA-dependent protein kinase (27Lees-Miller S.P. Chen Y. Anderson C.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 6472-6481Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar, 28Finnie N. Gottlieb T. Hartley K. Jackson S.P. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1993; 21: 930-935Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The DNA-dependent protein kinase and its regulatory subunit, Ku, may, therefore, play a key role in the signaling pathway of DNA damage (29Anderson C.W. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1993; 18: 433-437Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar).It was shown recently that the Ku heterodimer and human RAD51 coelute with the largest subunit of RNA polymerase II (30Maldanado E. Shiekhattar R. Sheldon M. Cho H. Drapkin R. Rickert P. Lees E. Anderson C.W. Linn S. Reinberg D. Nature. 1996; 381: 86-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). Moreover, DNA polymerase ϵ, which is involved in DNA repair synthesis (31Aboussekhra A. Biggerstaff M. Shivji M.K.K. Vilpo J.A. Moncollin V. Podust V.N. Protic M. Hübscher U. Egly J.-M. Wood R.D. Cell. 1995; 80: 859-868Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (749) Google Scholar) and also interacts with the Ku protein (32Hwang P.-I. Chu G. Asahara H. Linn S. FASEB J. 1995; 9: A1398Google Scholar), is a component of this RNA polymerase II complex (30Maldanado E. Shiekhattar R. Sheldon M. Cho H. Drapkin R. Rickert P. Lees E. Anderson C.W. Linn S. Reinberg D. Nature. 1996; 381: 86-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar).A DNA-dependent protein kinase has not yet been described in S. cerevisiae. However, a yeast homologue of the human Ku heterodimer, a high affinity DNA binding factor (HDF), 1The abbreviations used are: HDFhigh affinity DNA binding factorMMSmethyl methanesulfonatebpbase pair(s). has been identified (33Feldmann H.M. Winnacker E.-L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12895-12900Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). HDF is a heterodimeric protein binding to the ends of double-stranded DNA. The gene of the 70-kDa subunit, HDF1, has been cloned, and the predicted amino acid sequences share significant homology with the 70-kDa subunit of the human Ku protein (33Feldmann H.M. Winnacker E.-L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12895-12900Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). hdf1 mutant yeast strains are sensitive for the radiomimetic drug bleomycin (34Mages G.J. Feldmann H.M. Winnacker E.-L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7910-7915Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), an agent causing DNA double strand breaks (35D'Andrea A.D. Haseltine W.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1978; 75: 3608-3612Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar, 36Steighner R.J. Povirk L.F. Proc. Natl. Sci. Acad. U. S.

The disruption of the HDF1 gene also affects mating-type switching and spontaneous mitotic recombination (34Mages G.J. Feldmann H.M. Winnacker E.-L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7910-7915Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). hdf1 rad52 double mutant strains show an increased sensitivity toward ionizing radiation (38Siede W. Friedl A.A. Dianova I. Eckardt-Schupp F. Friedberg E.C. Genetics. 1996; 142: 91-102Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). HDF1 has been shown also to be involved in illegitimate recombination (39Tsukamoto Y. Kato J. Ikeda Hideo Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 2067-2072Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Another phenotype, which may not be related to the DNA repair activities of HDF, is the formation of substantially shorter telomeres in hdf1 mutant strains and a synthetic interaction of the hdf1 mutation with tel1 mutation, resulting in strains that grow slowly and have very short telomeres (40Porter S.E. Greenwell P.W. Ritchie K.B. Petes T.D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 582-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar).Here we show the cloning of HDF2, the second subunit of the HDF heterodimer. HDF2 displays significant homology to human Ku p80, comparable to the homology of HDF1 with Ku p70. While HDF1 does not bind DNA by itself, the HDF2 protein on its own displays DNA binding activity. Disruption of the hdf2 gene causes a temperature-sensitive phenotype for growth. This temperature sensitivity cannot be complemented by expression of the human Ku protein. hdf2 mutant strains are also sensitive toward bleomycin and methyl methane sulfonate but in comparison with hdf1 mutant strain this sensitivity is reduced."

An enzyme activity capable of non-ribosomal synthesis of D-lysergyl-L-alanyl-L-phenylalanyl-L-proline lactam, the non-cyclol precursor of the ergopeptine ergotamine, has been purified about 18-fold from the ergotamine-producing C. purpurea strain D1. Analysis of radioactively labeled enzyme-substrate complexes revealed a 370-kDa lysergyl peptide synthetase 1 (LPS 1) carrying the amino acid activation domains for alanine, phenylalanine, and proline. The activation of D-lysergic acid is catalyzed by a 140-kDa peptide synthetase (LPS 2) copurifying with LPS 1. LPS 1 and LPS 2 contain 4′-phosphopantetheine and bind their substrates covalently by thioester linkage. Kinetic analysis of the synthesis reaction revealed a Km of ∼1.4 µM for both D-lysergic acid and its structural homolog dihydrolysergic acid, which is one to two orders of magnitude lower than the Km values for the other amino acids involved. The Km values for the amino acids reflect their relative concentrations in the cellular pool of C. purpurea.

The ergot fungi growing on their host plants develop characteristic sclerotia containing ergot alkaloids. The basic structure of these compounds is a characteristic tetracyclic ring system (ergoline unit). The various ergolines are distinguished from each other by various side groups and modifications, and the most important among them is D1Hofmann A. Die Mutterkornalkaloide. Verlag Enke, Stuttgart1963: 35-70Google Scholar and 2Kobel H. Sanglier J.-J. Rehm H.-J. Reed G. Die MutterkornalkaloideBiotechnology. VCH Verlagsgesellschaft, Weinheim1986: 569-609Google Scholar). Natural and synthetic D-lysergic acid-derived compounds have various pharmacological activities that are used for human therapy (3Stadler P.A. Giger R. Krosgard-Larson P. Christensen C.H. Kofod H. Natural Products and Drug Development. Munksgaard, Copenhagen1984: 463-485Google Scholar). Knowledge about the biosynthesis of ergot alkaloids may help the development of new variants, and it may help in the suppression of their formation in the environment where they pose a serious risk for human and animal health. Ergot peptide alkaloids, also called ergopeptines, are produced by Claviceps purpurea and consist of cyclol-structured tripeptides attached by amide linkage to D-lysergic acid (Fig. 1a). Variations in the structures of naturally occurring ergopeptines arise by substitutions of the amino acid positions I and II, while amino acid III is always L-proline. Related to the ergopeptines are the ergopeptams (4Stadler P. Planta Med. 1982; 46: 131-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), which accumulate as by-products of ergopeptines in saprophytic cultures of some C. purpurea strains (5Stütz P. Brunner R. Stadler P. Experientia (Basel). 1973; 29: 936-937Crossref Scopus (34) Google Scholar) (reviewed in 2Kobel H. Sanglier J.-J. Rehm H.-J. Reed G. Die MutterkornalkaloideBiotechnology. VCH Verlagsgesellschaft, Weinheim1986: 569-609Google Scholar and 4Stadler P. Planta Med. 1982; 46: 131-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). They contain D-proline, and their tripeptide chain is a non-cyclol lactam (Fig. 1b). It has been postulated that the cyclol in the ergopeptines arises by introduction of a hydroxyl group to the α-C of the amino acid I of a putative D-lysergyl (L,L,L)tripeptide lactam (6Belzecki C. Quigley F.R. Floss H.G. J. Org. Chem. 1980; 45: 2215-2217Crossref Scopus (11) Google Scholar, 7Quigley F.R. Floss H.G. J. Org. Chem. 1981; 46: 464-466Crossref Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The reaction product is proposed to undergo ring closure to yield the corresponding ergopeptine most probably in a non-enzymatic reaction (8Hofmann A. Ott H. Griot R. Stadler P.A. Frey J. Helv. Chim. Acta. 1963; 46: 2306-2328Crossref Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Ergopeptams arise by spontaneous epimerization of D-lysergyl (L,L,L)tripeptide lactams in the proline residue (5Stütz P. Brunner R. Stadler P. Experientia (Basel). 1973; 29: 936-937Crossref Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Because of the D-configuration of proline, they cannot be converted into the corresponding ergopeptines and ergopeptams thus accumulate in cultures (4Stadler P. Planta Med. 1982; 46: 131-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). We have previously reported a cell-free system capable of forming the novel D-lysergyl peptides D-lysergyl-L-alanyl-L-phenylalanyl-L-proline lactam and the corresponding D-proline containing stereoisomer (9Keller U. Han M. Stoeffler-Meilicke M Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 6164-6170Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). They are synthesized from free D-lysergic acid, L-alanine, L-phenylalanine and L-proline with consumption of ATP (9Keller U. Han M. Stoeffler-Meilicke M Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 6164-6170Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The formation of the (L,L,L) compound has not been detected in in vivo conditions as yet, because it appears to be converted rapidly to the corresponding ergopeptine or ergopeptam. The in vitro formation, therefore, confirms the previous hypotheses on ergopeptine formation from the D-lysergyl peptide lactam as well as the intermediacy of free D-lysergic acid in the biosynthetic process. In the present report we describe the purification and characterization of the more than 500-kDa enzyme system catalyzing D-lysergyl peptide lactam synthesis. It will be shown that the enzyme system has four peptide synthetase activities. They activate and incorporate into product D-lysergic acid and the three amino acids of the tripeptide moiety. A thiol template mechanism is used as for other non-ribosomal peptide syntheses (10Lipmann F. Adv. Microbiol. Physiol. 1980; 21: 227-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). C. purpurea wild type ATCC 20102, its mutant derivative D1 selected for high production of ergotamine, and strain 1029, were described previously (11Keller U. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1983; 46: 580-584Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). C. purpurea strain Ecc93 (kindly supplied by Dr. H. Kobel, Sandoz AG) is a high producer of ergocristine. Maintenance and culture conditions for ATCC 20102-derived strains were as described previously (11Keller U. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1983; 46: 580-584Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12Keller U.

Strain Ecc93 was cultivated according to Kobel and Sanglier (13Kobel, H., Sanglier, J.-J., (1976) Swiss Patent 577556.Google Scholar). Inoculum medium and medium T25 were used for alkaloid fermentations (14Amici A.M. Minghetti A. Scotti T. Spalla C. Tognoli L.

L-[U-14C]phenylalanine (448 mCi/mmol), L-[U-14C]alanine (148 mCi/mmol), and L-[U-14C]proline (257 mCi/mmol) were from Amersham International. [9,10-3H]-9,10-Dihydrolysergic acid was prepared from [9,10-3H]-9,10-dihydroergocryptine as described previously (9Keller U. Han M. Stoeffler-Meilicke M Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 6164-6170Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Dihydrolysergic acid was kindly supplied by Dr. J.-J. Sanglier (Sandoz AG, Basel). D-Lysergic acid was prepared from ergotamine tartrate as described elsewhere (17Stoll A. Hofmann A. Becker B. Helv. Chim. Acta. 1943; 26: 1602-1613Crossref Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Silica gel aluminum sheets were from Merck (Darmstadt). Nitrocellulose membrane was from Amersham International, and glassy bond membrane was from Biometra (Göttingen, Germany). All other chemicals were of the highest purity commercially available. Amino acid analysis of enzymatically formed radioactive peptides was performed as described previously (9Keller U. Han M. Stoeffler-Meilicke M Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 6164-6170Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Quantitation and identification of enzymatically formed radioactive compounds were done either by liquid scintillation counting of ethyl acetate extracts of radioactive materials and by radioscanning of TLC separations, respectively. SDS-PAGE gels containing radioactively labeled proteins bands were first stained with Coomassie Blue and than were soaked with Amplify (Amersham International) according to the manufacturer's protocol and dried in a gel dryer. The gels were then either subjected to radioscanning or to autofluorography by exposure to x-ray film for several weeks. Similarly, for visualization of radioactive bands on TLC plates, exposure to x-ray film was for several days. In the case of tritium-labeled material, prior to exposure to x-ray film, plates were treated with ENHANCE (DuPont NEN) spray according to the manufacturer's instructions. Protein concentrations were determined according to Bradford (18Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (214148) Google Scholar). SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was performed according to Laemmli (19Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206276) Google Scholar). Staining of gels was either with Coomassie Blue or with silver (20Blum H. Beier H. Gross H.J. Electrophoresis. 1987; 8: 93-99Crossref Scopus (3733) Google Scholar). For molecular mass determinations, 4% SDS-PAGE gels in a mini-gel apparatus (Hoefer) were used. Molecular mass markers were enniatin synthetase (350 kDa), surfactin synthetase II (405 kDa), actinomycin synthetase II (280 kDa), gramicidin synthetase 2 (510 kDa), and myosin (205 kDa). Western blots were performed with 5% SDS-gels essentially according to Towbin et al. (21Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Detection of immunopositive bands was performed by standard techniques using 1:10,000 dilution of primary antibody, phosphatase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibody (Sigma) and nitro blue tetrazolium and 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate as reagents. 4′-Phosphopantetheine determinations of protein fractions (liquid samples) were done by the method of Pugh and Wakil (22Pugh E.L. Wakil S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1965; 240: 4727-4733Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) modified according to Zocher et al. (23Zocher R. Keller U. Kleinkauf H. Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 44-48Crossref Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Alternatively determinations of 4′-phosphopantetheine in protein bands were done according to a method of Stindl (24Stindl A. Untersuchungen zur Struktur und Funktion der Actinomycin Synthetasen.Ph.D. thesis. Technische Universität, Berlin, Berlin1993Google Scholar). To this end, enzyme concentrated after the DEAE-cellulose step (Table I) was electrophoresed in 1.5-mm thick SDS-PAGE gels and blotted onto glassy bond membranes. After brief staining with Coomassie Blue, bands of interest were cut out (in general from 5 to 10 lanes run in parallel), combined, and transferred to Eppendorf tubes. After treatment with 1 M NaOH in a boiling water bath for 1 h, samples were neutralized in 1 M Tris-HCl, pH 8. Alkaline phosphatase was added, and incubation was resumed for a further hour at 37°C. After this, the sample was subjected to a microbiological assay for the presence of panthetheine based on growth dependence of Lactobacillus plantarum DSM 20205. Controls involved treatment of glassy bond strips from the same lanes but devoid of protein bands and strips with protein bands known to contain no 4′-phosphopantetheine.Table I.Purification of D-lysergyl peptide synthetaseStepVolumeProteinUnitsaOne unit is the amount of enzyme catalyzing the formation of 1 nmol of D-lysergyl-alanyl-phenylalanyl-proline lactam at 26°C under the conditions described under “Materials and Methods.”Spec. activityYieldPurificationmlmgnmoles/minunits/mg protein%-fold1.

Assays for measuring D-lysergyl peptide lactam synthesis were as described elsewhere (9Keller U. Han M. Stoeffler-Meilicke M Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 6164-6170Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). In the case of testing fractions eluting from column separations, 1-ml portions from fractions of Ultrogel separations were concentrated about 10-fold on small DEAE-cellulose columns in Pasteur pipettes, equilibrated in buffer B (see “Buffers and Solvent Systems”). After elution with 0.2 M NaCl (in buffer B), enzyme was desalted on small AcA 202 Pasteur pipette columns eqilibarated with buffer B without dithioerythritol and assayed immediately. In the case of DEAE-cellulose fractions, the same procedure was used except that prior to concentration, samples were diluted 2-fold with buffer B to allow enzyme to adsorb to DEAE-cellulose. Reaction products were extracted into ethyl acetate and, after evaporation of solvent to dryness, analyzed by TLC in various solvent systems (see below). The assay for measuring thioester formation was as described previously (25Keller U. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 5852-5856Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Buffer A for the preparation of extracts of broken cell of C. purpurea was described previously (9Keller U. Han M. Stoeffler-Meilicke M Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 6164-6170Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Buffer B was 0.1 M Tris·HCl, pH 8.0, 15% (w/v) glycerol, 10 mM dithioerythritol, 1 mM benzamidine, 2 mM EDTA, 2 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. For the preparation of buffers, bidistilled water was used that had been previously autoclaved at 121°C for 20 min. TLC was performed on silica gel plates using the following solvent systems for the indicated purposes: ethyl acetate:methanol:water (100:5:5, by volume, solvent system I); ethyl acetate:methanol:water (100:10:5, by volume, solvent system II); ethyl acetate:dimethylformamide:ethanol (75:15:5, by volume, solvent system III) for chromatography of D-lysergyl peptides and ergopeptines; iso-propanol:acetic acid:water (70:30:20, by volume, solvent system IV), 1-butanol:acetic acid:water (4:1:1, by volume; solvent system V) for chromatography of amino acids; ethanol:water (8:2, by volume, solvent system VI) for chromatography of D-lysergic acid and dihydrolysergic acid. All operations were performed at 2-4°C. Approximately 50 g of freshly harvested mycelium of C. purpurea were suspended in 150 ml of buffer A and passed through a French press at 10,000 p.s.i. This method of cell disintegration was less time-consuming than the previously used procedure (9Keller U. Han M. Stoeffler-Meilicke M Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 6164-6170Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) and yielded more units of enzyme. The resultant homogenate was centrifuged at 15,000 rpm for 30 min in a SS34 rotor. To the supernatant was added a 15% Polymin P solution to give 0.3% final concentration. After 30 min, the sample was centrifuged as above. The clear supernatant was precipitated by fractionated ammonium sulfate from 35 to 55% saturation for 3 h standing on ice. After centrifugation as above, the pellet was dissolved in buffer B (designated crude extract). 3-4-ml portions of crude extract were subjected to Ultrogel AcA 34 gel chromatography on a column of bed dimensions 48 × 1.8 cm. 4-ml fractions were collected, and the various fractions were assayed for D-lysergyl peptide lactam synthesis or for peptide synthetase activities such thioester formation (25Keller U. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 5852-5856Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or the amino acid-dependent ATP-pyrophosphate exchange (26Keller U. Zocher R. Krengel U. Kleinkauf H. Biochem. J. 1984; 218: 857-862Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Fractions catalyzing D-lysergyl peptide lactam synthesis were pooled and applied onto a DEAE-cellulose column (bed dimensions 16 × 1.8 cm) that had been preequilibrated with buffer B. After washing the column with buffer B, the enzyme was eluted with a linear gradient from 0 to 0.3 M NaCl. Under these conditions, the enzyme elutes between 0.13 and 0.15 M NaCl. The peak located by assaying for D-lysergyl peptide lactam synthesis was diluted with two volumes of buffer B and concentrated by application onto a small DEAE-cellulose column (bed dimensions 1 × 5 cm) and subsequent elution with 0.2 M NaCl (see Table I). The 3-4 ml of the resultant eluate were applied onto a Ultrogel AcA 22 column (bed dimension 50 × 1.8 cm) that had been previously equilibrated with buffer B, and 3-ml fractions were collected. The enzyme eluted as a single peak. At this point, the enzyme was not further purified and immediately used up for investigation. Freezing the enzyme preparation led to heavy activity loss. The band of D-lysergyl peptide synthetase (LPS 1) 1The abbreviations used are: LPSD-lysergyl peptide synthetase; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. was cut after brief staining in 8-anilino-1-naphthelenesulfonate from 20 lanes of a 3-mm thick 5% SDS-gel, each lane containing a total of 400 µg of protein from the DEAE-cellulose step. After maceration of the gel pieces the protein was electroeluted in an Elutrap (Schleicher & Schuell) overnight using Laemmli electrophoresis buffer containing SDS. The electro-eluate (700 µl) contained about 150 µg of protein and, after mixing in complete Freund's adjuvant, was administered to a rabbit. A second injection of 150 µg was given 4 weeks after the first injection in incomplete Freund's adjuvant. Serum was taken 6 weeks after the first injection, and final bleeding was after 3 months. The resultant antiserum was used for Western blotting without further purification. D-lysergyl peptide synthetase; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. C. purpurea strain D1 produces ergotamine and minor amounts of Leu-ergokryptine. (Later, when antibodies were available (see below) it became clear that other strains in our laboratory such as Ecc93 (kindly provided by Dr. H. Kobel, Sandoz AG, Basel) or 1029 (11Keller U. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1983; 46: 580-584Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) would also have been suitable for enzyme preparation.) For enzyme extraction from strain D1, cells were harvested after 70 h of growth in inoculum medium or 120 h of growth in T25 medium. At these times the cultures were starting the main ergotamine accumulation phase (15Amici A.M. Minghetti A. Scotti T. Spalla C. Tognoli L. Appl. Microbiol. 1969; 18: 464-468Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Ergotamine was already detectable at ∼10 mg/liter after 36 h of growth in T25 medium. The extract from freshly harvested cells was fractionated by Polymin P precipitation and ammonium sulfate precipitation. Instead of total loss after standing on ice for 1 day (9Keller U. Han M. Stoeffler-Meilicke M Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 6164-6170Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), this preparation had a half-life of 16-20 h in buffer containing 15% glycerol, 10 mM dithioerythritol (or dithiothreitol), and various protease inhibitors. In the absence of dithioerythritol, the half-life of enzyme activity was reduced to 2-4 h in different preparations. The enzyme activity is, however, strongly inhibited by dithioerythritol and similar reagents (9Keller U. Han M. Stoeffler-Meilicke M Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 6164-6170Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Therefore, enzyme preparations were always desalted into dithioerythritol-free buffer prior to assaying. The assay reaction then proceeded fairly linearly for about 10 min at 25°C, then continued at a gradually reducing rate for up to 30 min. Further fractionation of crude extract was done with small portions (3-4 ml) on relatively small, fast-running Ultrogel AcA 34 columns. D-Lysergyl peptide-synthesizing activity appeared immediately behind the void volume, indicating that the protein was larger than 300 kDa, as was to be expected for a multifunctional protein involved in a non-ribosomal peptide synthesis (Fig. 2). The activity profile of D-lysergyl peptide formation showed a single peak which coincided with the peak for D-lysergic acid activation, measured by ATP-pyrophosphate exchange, and the binding of the three amino acids alanine, phenylalanine, and proline as thioesters (curves for alanine and proline are not shown). Interestingly, in these fractions dihydrolysergic acid was activated to nearly the same level as D-lysergic acid, which is consistent with the in vivo incorporation of this compound into the corresponding dihydroergopeptines (27Anderson J.A. Kim I.S. Lehtonen P. Floss H.G. J. Nat. Prod. 1979; 42: 271-273Crossref Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Further purification of enzyme was achieved by chromatography on DEAE-cellulose from which it eluted as a single peak between 130 and 150 mM NaCl (not shown). Finally, the enzyme preparation was subjected to gel filtration on Ultrogel AcA 22. The overall purification was about 18-fold and the yield was 1.7%. The data for the individual steps are listed in Table I. Attempts to achieve higher specific activity were unsuccessful because of severe activity losses. It was noted that phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride improved enzyme stability at all stages of purification. SDS-PAGE revealed that the preparation contained at all stages multiple protein bands. The two strongest bands in the Mr range higher than that of myosin (205,000) can be seen in Fig. 3 (indicated by arrows). They appear to become enriched in the course of the activity purification and were therefore considered as candidates for the putative D-lysergyl peptide synthetase.Fig. 3SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis analysis of various steps in the purification of D-lysergyl peptide synthetase. Samples from the various purification steps indicated in Table I were subjected to SDS-PAGE (left panel) and Western blotting (right panel). Each lane contains 10 µg of protein. Lane 1, marker from 20 to 205 kDa; lanes 2 and 2′, extract from broken cells; lanes 3 and 3′, crude extract; lanes 4 and 4′, pool from Ultrogel AcA 34; lane 5 and 5′, DEAE-cellulose concentrated enzyme; lanes 6 and 6′, Ultrogel AcA 22. Note that on this 5% gel proteins <150 kDa migrate with the front. Arrow a indicates LPS 1, arrow b the 250-kDa protein that copurifies with LPS (see text). Immunostaining (lanes 2′-6′) was performed as described under “Materials and Methods.”View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Identification of D-Lysergyl Peptide Synthetase—To see which one of the two prominent large proteins seen in Fig. 3 was responsible for synthesis of the D-lysergyl peptide lactam, concentrated enzyme purified on Ultrogel AcA 22 was incubated with radioactively labeled phenylalanine, proline, alanine, or dihydrolysergic acid each in the presence of ATP. The samples were fractionated by SDS-PAGE, and the radioactive bands were identified by autofluorography. Fig. 4 shows that [14C]phenylalanine labeled the slowest migrating protein (designated LPS 1) and a protein of ∼120 kDa which was presumed to be a degradation product of the larger protein. Interestingly, labeling with [3H]dihydrolysergic acid revealed a 140-kDa protein, LPS 2, which is responsible for D-lysergic acid activation and incorporation into the peptide. Labeling of LPS 1 by [14C]proline and [14C]alanine yielded only a faint band in the autofluorograms. Besides the weak response of 14C-labeled compounds to the fluorophor used in these experiments, the faint labeling may be due to the high Km values for alanine and proline (see below) and the fact that purified enzyme preparations usually contain varying amounts of amino acids already bound to the enzyme. This can also explain uneven product labeling (9Keller U. Han M. Stoeffler-Meilicke M Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 6164-6170Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Furthermore, instability of thioesters during electrophoresis might also influence labeling. Preparative electrophoresis was used to obtain LPS 1 to prepare specific antiserum. Western blots of samples from the various purification steps show many of the lower bands cross-reacting with the antiserum. The increase of these bands during isolation (Fig. 3, lane 3′) suggests that LPS 1 is, at least in part, cleaved after cell disruption. Interestingly, the antibodies show no significant cross-reaction with the strong band copurifying with LPS 1 and migrating between myosin and LPS 1, suggesting that this band represents a protein unrelated to LPS 1. The molecular mass of LPS 1 was determined using 4% SDS-PAGE gels using peptide synthetases of known molecular mass as reference markers. Fig. 5 shows that LPS 1 has a molecular mass of 370 kDa, which should be sufficient for three amino acid activation domains (28Stachelhaus T. Marahiel M.A. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1995; 125: 3-14Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 29Kleinkauf H. von Döhren H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 192: 1-5Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). From these considerations it is unlikely, however, that the 370-kDa protein could contain all four amino acid domains required for synthesis of the whole D-lysergyl peptide lactam. LPS 2, which was found in the same protein fraction, is most probably carrying the residual fourth domain required for tetrapeptide synthesis. Covalent binding of substrate amino acids to peptide synthetases in thioester-linkage is a prerequisite for peptide formation in non-ribosomal peptide synthesis (28Stachelhaus T. Marahiel M.A. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1995; 125: 3-14Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 29Kleinkauf H. von Döhren H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 192: 1-5Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). Accordingly, when testing LPS 1 we saw thioester formation of alanine, phenylalanine, and proline (as measured by conversion of substrates into a trichloroacetic acid-precipitable form) which was very rapid and required ATP and Mg2+. Analysis of these covalent enzyme-substrate complexes showed that they could be cleaved by performic acid but not by formic acid. Cleavage was also seen upon treatment with mild alkali such as 0.1 N NaOH for 10 min at room temperature. 2B. Walzel, B. Riederer, and U. Keller, unpublished data. Fig. 6 shows the"

Clearly, K protein is a very interactive molecule that appears to be involved in signal transduction, gene transcription, and mRNA processing. Considering K protein's highly interactive nature, we reasoned that it could be used as a probe to uncover novel processes and factors involved in signal transduction and gene expression. Therefore, we used K protein as a bait in the yeast two-hybrid screen (19Fields S. Song O. Nature. 1989; 340: 245-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (4863) Google Scholar) and have isolated a novel gene that encodes a transcriptional repressor. The rat glomerular epithelial cells, the murine pre-B lymphocytes 70Z/3, the human epidermoid KB, and the monkey kidney COS cell lines were grown as described before (20Richardson C.A. Gordon K.L.

The mammalian expression vector pM2 was kindly provided by Dr. I. Sadowski (University of British Columbia, Vancouver, Canada). Glutathione agarose beads were obtained from Sigma. Total RNA was extracted essentially as described previously (21Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63187) Google Scholar). Cells or animal tissues was washed with PBS. 2.0 ml of Solution D (4 M guanidinium thiocyanate, 25 mM sodium citrate, 0.5% sarkosyl, 0.1 Mβ-mercaptoethanol) was added to each plate or to 100 mg of animal tissue to lyse the cells. The final RNA was dissolved in 25 µl of water and used for Northern blot analysis. RNA was analyzed essentially as described previously (22Johnson R.J. Iida H. Alpers C.E. Majesky M.W. Schwartz S.M.

After first denaturing in formaldehyde and formamide at 65°C for 15 min, the RNA sample was cooled to 4°C on ice. 10 µg of total RNA per lane was resolved by electrophoresis for 4 h at 70 V using 1.4% agarose gel containing 2.2 M formaldehyde. RNA was transferred overnight in 20 × SSC to Hybond N+ membrane (Amersham, Arlington Heights, IL), and dried at 80°C for 45 min. The membranes were prehybridized for 2 h at 42°C in hybridization buffer (50% formamide, 5 × Denhardt's solution, 5 × SSC, 0.5% SDS, 0.1 mg/ml denatured salmon sperm DNA, and 0.1 mg/ml yeast tRNA).

Following hybridization, the membranes were washed twice in 2 × SSC with 0.1% SDS at 22°C for 10 min, then twice in 0.1 × SSC with 0.1% SDS at 55°C for 20 min, and autoradiographed. The procedure used here was based on methods previously described (19Fields S. Song O. Nature. 1989; 340: 245-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (4863) Google Scholar, 23Vojtek A.B. Hollenberg S.M. Cooper J.A. Cell. 1993; 74: 205-214Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1663) Google Scholar). Briefly, for the screen, the L40 strain of yeast was used, which is auxotrophic for his, trp, leu, and ade (generated by Dr. Stanley Hollenberg). The L40 yeast strain contains both lacZ and HIS3 marker genes under the control of minimal GAL1 promoters fused with multimers of LexA DNA-binding sites. Yeast strains were grown at 30°C in rich medium containing 1% yeast extract, 2% Bacto-peptone, 2% glucose, and 0.1 mg/ml adenine. To construct the bait, the open-reading frame of a K protein was used as a template for PCR. The PCR primers were programmed to contain a BamHI site on the 5′ end and stop codon and a SalI site on the 3′ end. After digestion, the PCR-generated fragments were subcloned in-frame with LexA in the pBTM116 vector, the DNA-binding domain plasmid (pBTM116 was constructed by Drs. Paul Bartel and Stan Fields). The cDNA library for the yeast two-hybrid screen was generated by random-primed cDNA synthesis from a mouse 9-10-day-old embryo (Dr. Stanley Hollenberg), and size-selected to have inserts in the range of 350-700 nucleotides. This library was inserted into the transcription activation domain vector, pVP16, to generate VP16-cDNA hybrid proteins. Yeast was first transformed with the bait plasmid, and then the L40 LexA-K protein strains were transformed with the cDNA library. Screening for positive clones containing the two plasmids, LexA-K fusion protein and the activation domain-library plasmids, was done by growth on His selective media and by testing the colonies for β-galactosidase activity (23Vojtek A.B. Hollenberg S.M. Cooper J.A. Cell. 1993; 74: 205-214Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1663) Google Scholar). To eliminate false positive clones, we mated a transformant containing the positive cDNA library plasmid with a strain transformed with LexA-lamin fusion protein plasmid, pLAM5 (generated by Dr. R. Sternglanz), as a nonspecific “bait” (24Bartel P. Chien C. Sternglanz R. Fields S. BioTechniques. 1993; 14: 920-924PubMed Google Scholar). The partial cDNA labeled by random priming using [α-32P]dCTP (Amersham) was used to screen approximately 106 plaque-forming units of a cDNA library in λgt10 from 22D6 mouse pre-B cells (provided by Dr. A. Bothwell, Yale University) as described previously (9Ostrowski J. Van Seuningen I. Seger R. Rouch C.T. Sleath P.R. McMullen B.A. Bomsztyk K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17626-17634Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 25Ballard D.W. Philbrick W.M. Bothwell A.L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 8450-8457Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Several clones were plaque-purified and subcloned into pBluescript vector (Stratagene) for sequencing. Sequencing was performed using DyeDeoxy Terminator Cycle Sequencing Kit (Perkin Elmer). The partial or complete cDNAs were used as template for in vitro transcription by SP6 or T7 DNA-dependent RNA polymerases to generate mRNAs for in vitro translation as described previously (26Gurevich V.V. Pokrovskaya I.D. Obukhova T.A. Zozulya S.A. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 195: 207-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). In vitro translation in rabbit reticulocyte cell-free system was performed according to the manufacturer's protocol (Promega, Madison, WI). 5 µl of the 35S-labeled translation products were added to a suspension of 10 µl of glutathione beads bearing either the full-length or a fragment of K protein fused to GST in 100 µl of binding buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mM KCl, 1.0 mM MgCl2, and 0.1% Nonidet P-40). After mixing for 60 min (4°C), the beads were washed three times with 400 µl of binding buffer and were boiled with 30 µl of SDS sample buffer, and released proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. StuI-SmaI fragment containing five Gal4-binding elements and TATA box from pG5bCAT plasmid (27Kakidani H. Ptashne M. Cell. 1988; 52: 161-167Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar) was introduced into the SmaI site of pGL3 enh plasmid (Promega) to create a reporter plasmid pG5GL3 enh. Expression plasmid pM2Zik1 was constructed by insertion of the full-length coding region of Zik1, which was modified by PCR to create appropriate cloning sites, into the BamHI site of pM2 plasmid (28Sadowski I. Ptashne M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 7539Crossref PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar). The final construct contained an insert encoding the Gal4 DNA-binding domain-Zik1 fusion protein under the control of SV40 promoter. The plasmid pM2ZikDBH was derived from pM2Zik1 by cutting at BstXI-HindIII and blunt-ligating the linearized plasmid creating the N-terminal 54 amino acids of Zik1 fused to the Gal4 DNA-binding domain. Mammalian expression vector (5 µg/plate) containing an insert encoding K protein was co-transfected into COS cells with expression vector (5 µg/plate) containing an insert encoding either the Gal4 DNA-binding domain or Gal4-DNA-binding domain-Zik1 fusion protein. 48 h after transfection, cells were lysed with 150 µl of extraction buffer (10 mM Hepes, pH 7.5, 100 mM KCl, 1.0 mM Mg2Cl, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 0.5 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 µg/ml leupeptin, and 0.5% Triton X-100). For immunoprecipitation, 50 µl of the cell extracts diluted 2× with extraction buffer (no inhibitors) were incubated with 1 µg of anti-Gal4 DNA-binding domain monoclonal antibody (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA). After 2 h (4°C), 5 µl of protein A-Sepharose beads (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) were added for another hour of incubation and were then washed three times with 400 µl of TBST (10 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100). Prior to use, protein A-Sepharose beads were blocked for 1 h with 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin in TBST. Proteins were eluted from the beads with SDS loading buffer and were resolved by SDS-PAGE. Rat glomerular epithelial and COS cells were grown in Dulbecco's minimal essential medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum to approximately 60-75% of confluence in 100-mm diameter dishes and were transfected using the DEAE-dextran method (29Kluxen F.W. Lubbert H. Anal. Biochem. 1993; 208: 352-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were treated with a total of 15-20 µg of plasmid DNA in 5 ml of Dulbecco's minimal essential medium and 0.16 mg/ml DEAE-dextran. After a 4-h incubation, cells were shocked for 1 min at room temperature with 10% dimethyl sulfoxide in 1 × PBS, were washed twice with PBS, and fresh medium was added. After 48 h, transfected cells were washed twice with PBS, scraped with a rubber policeman, and spun down in a microcentrifuge. The cell pellet was resuspended in 150 µl of ice-cold 1 × lysis buffer (Promega). The supernatant was assayed for luciferase activity by the standard Promega protocol using a luminometer. The N-terminal two-thirds of K protein (amino acids 1-318) (14Van Seuningen I. Ostrowski J. Bustelo X. Sleath P. Bomsztyk K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26976-26985Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar) was used as a bait in two-hybrid screen to isolate K protein molecular partners. A partial cDNA of 366 base pairs in length was isolated and sequenced, and this cDNA represented a fragment of a novel gene. This partial cDNA was used to screen a λgt10 cDNA library (30Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) derived from the murine pre-B cell line, 22D6, and 3 putative clones were isolated and subcloned into a pBluescript vector. The longest clone was used for sequencing of both strands. The complete nucleic acid and deduced amino acid sequences of the 3042-long cDNA clone are shown in Fig. 1. The ATG located at position +245 is an initiation codon which starts the longest open reading frame. This clone encodes a protein of 463 amino acids, with a calculated molecular weight of 52,778 and a pI of 8.5. The cloned cDNA contains a short 5′ (244-base pair) and a long 3′ (1406-base pair) untranslated region (Fig. 1.). Comparison of the deduced primary structure of the protein with sequences in the data base revealed that the cDNA encodes a protein with the N-terminal segment (amino acids 14-47) similar to Kid1, a zinc finger protein enriched in the rat kidney (31Witzgall R. O'Leary E. Gessner R. Ouellette A.J. Bonventre J.V. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 1933-1942Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 32Witzgall R. O'Leary E. Leaf A. Onaldi D. Bonventre J.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 4514-4518Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2C). Notably, this region contains the Kruppel-associated type A box (KRAB-A). This highly conserved motif is present in approximately one-third of all zinc finger proteins and has been shown to mediate transcriptional repression (32Witzgall R. O'Leary E. Leaf A. Onaldi D. Bonventre J.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 4514-4518Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). The C terminus of the cloned protein (amino acids 215-463) consists of nine contiguous repeats that are similar or identical to the C2H2 zinc finger consensus sequence (YxCxxCxxxFxxxxxLxxHxxxHTGEKP) (Fig. 2B) (33Thiesen H.J. New Biol. 1990; 2: 363-374PubMed Google Scholar). The cDNA fragment isolated in the two-hybrid screen represented the 59-180-amino acid stretch of the full-length protein. Therefore, this 122-amino acid- long stretch contains the K protein-binding domain (Fig. 1, Fig. 2A). We have designated this novel protein Zik1, for zinc-finger protein interacting with K protein.Fig. 2Analysis of the primary structure of Zik1 and its similarity to Kid1. A, functional domains of Zik1. B, primary structure of the nine contiguous repeats of Zik1 zinc fingers and their similarity to Kox zinc finger consensus sequence (33Thiesen H.J.

RNA was isolated from a variety of mouse tissues and cells grown in culture, separated by size on an agarose-formaldehyde gel, and blotted onto a nylon membrane. Fig. 3 illustrates the autoradiogram of the Northern blot. In the tissues tested, a 3.3-kilobase transcript was most abundant in ovaries (lane 2) and liver (lane 4), and, although present, the message levels in brain (lane 1) and muscle (lane 3) were very low. Zik1 mRNA was also present in the human epidermoid carcinoma KB (34Bird T.A. Saklatvala J. J. Immunol. 1989; 142: 126-133PubMed Google Scholar) (lane 5), the murine pre-B lymphocyte 70Z/3 cell line (35Paige C.J. Kincaide P.W. Ralph P. J. Immunol. 1978; 121: 641-647PubMed Google Scholar), and the rat primary glomerular epithelial line (20Richardson C.A. Gordon K.L. Couser W.G. Bomsztyk K. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 268: F273-F278PubMed Google Scholar) (lane 7). Comparison among the tissues and cell line tested demonstrates that the level of expression is by far highest in the glomerular epithelial cells. Antibodies to GST-Zik1 fusion protein in a Western blot detected a band corresponding to Zik1 in glomerular epithelial but not in COS cells (data not shown). It is interesting to note that Kid1, the zinc finger protein that shares most sequence similarities to Zik1, is also expressed preferentially in the kidney (31Witzgall R. O'Leary E. Gessner R. Ouellette A.J. Bonventre J.V. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 1933-1942Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). To determine whether or not the interaction of K protein with Zik1 is direct, we tested the ability of 35S-labeled Zik1 in vitro translated to bind to glutathione beads bearing the GST-K fusion protein (14Van Seuningen I. Ostrowski J. Bustelo X. Sleath P. Bomsztyk K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26976-26985Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). After incubation with Zik1, beads were washed, boiled in the presence of SDS, and proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE. The Coomassie Blue-stained and autoradiographed gel is illustrated in Fig. 4. In agreement with the yeast two-hybrid screen, these results revealed that Zik1 binds to the beads bearing the full-length K protein fused to GST (lane 1). Zik1 also binds to several K protein deletion fragments, the GST-K13 (amino acids 1-337) (lane 2) and GST-K3 (amino acids 171-337) (lane 5), but not to the GST-K8 (amino acids 1-108) (lane 4) or the GST-K12 (amino acids 1-209) (lane 3) deletion mutants. These results suggest that the binding of Zik1 to K protein is direct and specific and allow us to map the Zik1-binding site to the 209-337-amino acid domain of K protein. K protein binds to RNA and to single- and double-stranded DNA in a sequence-selective manner (6Tomonaga T. Levens D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4875-4881Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar, 9Ostrowski J. Van Seuningen I. Seger R. Rouch C.T. Sleath P.R. McMullen B.A. Bomsztyk K. J. Biol.

Because the function of K protein might be regulated by its binding to RNA and DNA, we next tested the effect of cognate nucleic acid motifs on the interaction of Zik1 with K protein. Results of this series of experiments are illustrated in Fig. 5. The binding assay was performed as described above (Fig. 4) in the presence or absence of RNA or DNA. These results showed that poly(C) RNA, which binds K protein, blocked Zik1 binding to K protein, while poly(A), which does not bind K protein (1Matunis M.J. Michael W.M. Dreyfuss G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 164-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar), did not affect binding of Zik1 to glutathione beads bearing K protein (compare lanes 3 and 4 with lane 2). Similarly, a double-stranded synthetic oligonucleotide containing the κB motif and the single-stranded synthetic oligonucleotide containing the antisense κB motif, both of which bind K protein (9Ostrowski J. Van Seuningen I. Seger R. Rouch C.T. Sleath P.R. McMullen B.A. Bomsztyk K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17626-17634Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), blocked Zik1 binding (compare lanes 7 and 9 with lane 6), while the single-stranded sense κB, which does not bind K protein, did not alter Zik1 binding (compare lane 8 with lane 6). These results demonstrate that cognate RNA and DNA sequences both block the interaction of Zik1 with K protein. This experiment, in conjunction with the observation that K protein phosphorylation is regulated by nucleic acid binding (9Ostrowski J. Van Seuningen I. Seger R. Rouch C.T. Sleath P.R. McMullen B.A. Bomsztyk K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17626-17634Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14Van Seuningen I. Ostrowski J. Bustelo X. Sleath P. Bomsztyk K. J. Biol.

Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 5644-5650Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), indicates that K protein function is highly regulated by cognate RNA and DNA motifs. To determine whether Zik1 and K protein interact in vivo in mammalian cells, we used monoclonal antibody directed against Gal4 DNA-binding domain to determine whether K protein co-immunoprecipitated with either Gal4 or Gal4-Zik1 fusion proteins when they were co-expressed in COS cells. Western blot analysis using an antibody directed against K protein (Fig. 6) showed that the anti-Gal4 antibody precipitated K protein (lane 2) when it was co-expressed with Gal4-Zik1 fusion protein, but not when it was co-expressed with Gal4 protein alone (lane 1). This experiment provides further evidence that Zik1 and K protein can interact in vivo. Zik1 contains the KRAB-A domain and shares sequence similarity with the transcriptional repressor Kid1, suggesting that Zik1 might also affect transcription. To determine the transcriptional activity of Zik1, either the full-length Zik1 (amino acids 1-463) or its KRAB-A domain (amino acids 1-54) were fused in-frame to the Gal4 DNA-binding domain (amino acids 1-147) in the mammalian expression vector pM2 (36Sadowski I. Bell B. Broad P. Hollis M. Gene (Amst.). 1992; 118: 137-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). These constructs were transiently co-expressed with the reporter luciferase gene plasmids in either rat glomerular epithelial or COS cell lines. The results of luciferase activity assay are shown in Fig. 7. The full-length Gal4-Zik1 and more so its KRAB-A domain substantially repressed transcription of the luciferase gene driven by a promoter containing 5 Gal4 DNA elements (shaded bars), but did not diminish activity of the same promoter lacking the Gal4-binding motifs (clear bars). These results demonstrate that, like Kid1 (31Witzgall R. O'Leary E. Gessner R. Ouellette A.J. Bonventre J.V. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 1933-1942Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), Zik1 can act as a transcriptional repressor. The observation that K protein can engage both a transcriptional repressor and the TFIID TATA-binding protein may explain why expression of K protein can both activate and repress gene promoters (8Michelotti E.F. Michelotti G.A. Aronsohn A.I. Levens D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2350-2360Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar, 11Lee M.-H. Mori S. Raychaudhuri P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3420-3427Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Identification of a transcriptional repressor that directly interacts with K protein further expands the repertoire of K protein molecular partners: sequence-specific RNA and DNA, Vav, both tyrosine and serine/threonine kinases, TATA-binding protein, and now Zik1. What are the possible implications of this versatility? Not only is K protein very interactive, but it is also abundant, and is present both in the nucleus and the cytoplasm (9Ostrowski J. Van Seuningen I. Seger R. Rouch C.T. Sleath P.R. McMullen B.A. Bomsztyk K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17626-17634Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Van Seuningen I. Ostrowski J.

The diversity of K protein molecular interactions, K protein abundance, and wide intracellular distribution would fit a model in which K protein acts as a universal docking platform. The yeast two-hybrid screen revealed that K protein can interact with itself at two different sites (data not shown), suggesting that it has the potential to form oligomers. If so, this would provide the K protein with a great capacity to permit simultaneous docking of a number of proteins and thus provide an environment for multilateral protein cross-talk. As exemplified by the K protein-Zik1 (Fig. 5) and K protein-K protein kinase (9Ostrowski J. Van Seuningen I. Seger R. Rouch C.T. Sleath P.R. McMullen B.A. Bomsztyk K. J. Biol.

Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 5644-5650Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) interactions, a cross-talk among the docked proteins could be regulated by sequence-specific nucleic acids. The potential of K protein to simultaneously engage and allow cross-talk between signaling molecules such as Src or Vav, with transcriptional repressors such as Zik1, opens up an exciting avenue to investigate.

https://openalex.org/W2002701625,Activation of p21ras by GTP loading is a critical step in a cascade of intracellular insulin signaling. Farnesylation of p21ras protein is an obligatory event that facilitates Ras migration to the plasma membrane and subsequent activation. Farnesyltransferase (FTase) is a ubiquitous enzyme that catalyzes the lipid modification of p21ras by the addition of farnesyl to the C-terminal “CAAX” motif. In vitro and in vivo FTase activities were studied in 3T3-L1 adipocytes in response to insulin challenge. Insulin exerted a biphasic stimulatory effect on FTase activity measured in vitro with a 31% increase at 5 min and a 130% increase at 60 min. Insulin-stimulated farnesylation of p21ras pools in vivo correlated with FTase activity seen in vitro by displaying an increase in farnesylated p21ras from 40% of total cellular Ras in control cells to 63% by 5 min and 80% by 60 min (p < 0.05) in insulin-treated cells. Insulin challenge of 3T3-L1 adipocytes increased incorporation of tritiated mevalonic acid in p21ras in a dose-dependent manner and stimulated a 2-fold increase in phosphorylation of the α-subunit of FTase at 5 min and a 4-fold increase at 60 min.

SH-PTP2 was shown to associate with a 115-kDa tyrosine-phosphorylated protein (pp115), as well as with insulin receptor substrate 1, in insulin-stimulated Chinese hamster ovary cells that overexpress human insulin receptors (CHO-IR cells). In vivo and in vitro binding experiments revealed that SH-PTP2 bound to pp115 through one or both of its SH2 domains. The pp115 protein was partially purified from insulin-stimulated CHO-IR cells that overexpress a catalytically inactive SH-PTP2 by a combination of immunoaffinity and lectin-affinity chromatography. A monoclonal antibody to pp115 was then generated by injecting the partially purified protein into mice. Experiments with this monoclonal antibody revealed that pp115 is a transmembrane protein with a domain exposed on the cell surface and that it binds to SH-PTP2 in response to insulin. The insulin receptor kinase appeared to phosphorylate pp115 on tyrosine residues both in vivo and in vitro. The extent of tyrosine phosphorylation of pp115 associated with SH-PTP2 was greatly increased in CHO-IR cells that overexpress catalytically inactive SH-PTP2 compared with that observed in CHO-IR cells overexpressing wild-type SH-PTP2. Furthermore, recombinant SH-PTP2 preferentially dephosphorylated pp115 in vitro, indicating that SH-PTP2 may catalyze the dephosphorylation of phosphotyrosine residues in pp115 after it binds to this protein.

While Jurkat cells co-expressed two discrete cell-surface isoforms of CD43, recognized by mAb J393 and mAb G10-2, respectively, only J393/CD43 signaled apoptosis.

Due to the repulsive effect of its high numbers of O-linked negatively charged sialic acid sugar residues, CD43 acts as a “barrier molecule” by limiting cell-cell/cell-ligand interactions (3Brown W.R.A.

Ardman B. Nature. 1995; 377: 535-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). In addition, engagement of CD43 by monoclonal antibodies has been shown to induce costimulatory activity in T-cells by a mechanism analogous to a classic ligand-receptor interaction (9Sportsman J.R.

Based on the exon/intron arrangement within its gene, the observed molecular heterogeneity of CD43 in both mice and man is thought to reflect differential post-translational modifications of a single gene product (20Pallant A.

This change in oligosaccharide structure results in a shift from 115 to 140 kDa (9Sportsman J.R. Park M.M. Cheresh D.A. Fukuda M. Elder J.H. Fox R.I. J. Immunol. 1985; 135: 158-164PubMed Google Scholar, 17Saitoh O. Piller F. Fox R.I. Fukuda M. Blood. 1991; 77: 1491-1499Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 25Bierhuizen M.F.A. Maemura K. Fukuda M. J. Biol.

Immunol. 1983; 131: 762-767PubMed Google Scholar).There is little information correlating heterogeneity in oligosaccharide structure with ligand specificity or the signal transducing properties of CD43. In the thymus, thymocyte-thymic epithelial cell interactions correlate with the preferential binding of galectin-1 to the mAb T-305/CD43 isoform expressed in immature, cortical thymocytes (27Baum L.G.

In mature T-cells the binding of anti-CD43 antibodies, thought to mimic natural ligands, results in CD28-independent costimulatory activity (11Alvarado M. Klassen C. Cerny J. Horejsi V. Schmidt R.E.

Interestingly, the L10 antibody directed against a neuraminidase-resistant epitope of CD43 is a strong inducer of T-cell proliferation, whereas the B1B6 antibody directed against a neuraminidase-sensitive epitope is only weakly mitogenic (10Axelsson B. Youseffi-Etemad R. Hammarstrom S. Perlmann P. J. Immunol. 1988; 141: 2912-2917PubMed Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitations from T-lymphoblastoid cell lysates have found CD43 to be associated with CD3/TcR and p56LCK protein tyrosine kinase (11Alvarado M. Klassen C. Cerny J. Horejsi V. Schmidt R.E. Eur. J. Immunol. 1995; 25: 1051-1055Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), providing both physical and functional evidence for a role for CD43 in signal transduction. The anti-CD43 antibody, mAb MEM-59, which is costimulatory in T-lymphocytes has recently been reported to induce programmed cell death or apoptosis in hematopoietic progenitor cells (32Bazil V. Brandt J. Tsukamoto A. Hoffman R. Blood. 1995; 86: 502-511Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Clearly, CD43-mediated responses can differ significantly depending on the cell type and the isoform being expressed. While aberrant isoforms of CD43 have been associated with immunodeficiencies resulting in lymphopenia (33Cooper M.D. Chase H.P. Lowman J.T. Krivit W. Good R.A. Clin. Stud. 1968; 44: 499-513Google Scholar, 34Bowen D.L. Lane H.C. Fauci A.S. Ann. Intern. Med. 1985; 103: 704-709Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar), there has been no direct evidence linking CD43-mediated apoptosis with T-cell depletion.Here we report the biochemical and functional characterization of an anti-CD43 mAb designated J393 that recognizes a unique, alternatively glycosylated isoform of CD43 expressed on the surface of the human T-lymphoblastoid cell line, Jurkat. Treatment of Jurkat cells with mAb J393 induces apoptosis in a CD43 isoform-specific manner. The level of apoptosis may be enhanced by concomitant engagement of the TcR or integrin molecules. Moreover, an isoform of CD43 is detected in peripheral blood T-lymphocytes bearing a cryptic epitope for mAb J393. These results describe a potentially novel mechanism for T-cell lineage depletion involving the regulated expression of specific isoforms of CD43.DISCUSSIONThe existence of a CD43-mediated pathway for signaling apoptosis in T-cell lineages has not been previously described. Our observation that the BMS-2 Jurkat cell line co-expressed two antigenically distinct isoforms of CD43 on its surface provided us with a good model for examining structure-function relationships between these two molecules. While both mAb J393 and mAb G10-2 induced homotypic adhesion, only mAb J393 induced apoptosis. This implied that the apoptotic response was independent of the homotypic adhesion phenomenon and was associated with a specific CD43 isoform. The reactivity of mAb G10-2 required terminal sialic acid moieties, whereas reactivity of mAb J393 was sialic acid-independent. Other investigators have observed sialic acid-independent CD43 antibodies to elicit stronger cellular responses than their sialic acid-dependent counterparts (10Axelsson B. Youseffi-Etemad R. Hammarstrom S. Perlmann P. J. Immunol. 1988; 141: 2912-2917PubMed Google Scholar). We found the carbohydrate structure of J393/CD43 in Jurkat cells to be deficient in oligosaccharide complexity and sialic acid content when compared with that of the G10-2/CD43 isoform expressed in HPB-ALL cells. The majority of serine/threonine residues in the extracellular portion of the J393 antigen contained only terminal GalNAc monosaccharides, similar to the Tn antigen-bearing CD43 molecule expressed in Jurkat cells (50Nakada H. Inoue M. Tanaka N. Numada Y. Kitagawa H. Fukui S. Yama-Shina I. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 179: 762-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Glycopeptides generated from intact mAb J393 antigen lost functional epitope as determined by immunoaffinity chromatography run under conditions that favor interaction of low valency glycopeptides with the antibody. Low valency for antibodies has been reported for glycopeptides containing the cluster antigens of Tn when compared with intact glycoprotein (56Inoue M. Nakada H. Tanaka N. Yamashina I. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 85-88PubMed Google Scholar). Although mAb J393 likely recognizes the Tn-containing isoform of CD43, it does not react with the surface of certain cell types expressing Tn epitopes. Therefore, we propose that mAb J393 recognizes a unique epitope on CD43 that has not been previously characterized.Little is known about how CD43 functions as a signaling molecule. We find that soluble, bivalent antibody is sufficient to initiate a CD43 signal, unlike the requirement for trimeric ligation by members of the TNF receptor superfamily including CD95/Fas (57Smith C.A. Farrah T. Goodwin R.G. Cell. 1994; 76: 959-962Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1831) Google Scholar). In T-lymphocytes, CD43 has been shown to be constitutively phosphorylated in resting cells and hyperphosphorylated following cellular activation (58Piller V. Piller F. Fukuda M. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 18824-18831Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Because CD43 contains no catalytic region or tyrosine residues within the cytoplasmic domain, its phosphorylation is thought to reflect its association with serine/threonine-specific protein kinases (59Chatila T.A. Geha R.S. J. Immunol. 1988; 140: 4308-4314PubMed Google Scholar, 60Axelsson B. Perlmann P. Scand. J. Immunol. 1989; 30: 539-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 61Fukuda M. Carlsson S.R. Med. Biol. 1986; 64: 335-343PubMed Google Scholar). However, investigators characterizing CD43 as a CD28-independent costimulatory molecule have described the physical association of CD43 with CD3 in a complex containing the SRC family protein tyrosine kinases lck and fyn (11Alvarado M. Klassen C. Cerny J. Horejsi V. Schmidt R.E. Eur. J. Immunol. 1995; 25: 1051-1055Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), suggesting an involvement of CD43 with tyrosine phosphorylation events. Indeed, pretreatment of Jurkat cells with the tyrosine kinase inhibitor herbimycin A significantly interfered with mAb J393-induced cell death. We found that treatment of Jurkat cells with mAb J393 induced a rapid increase in overall protein tyrosine phosphorylation and, in particular, for proteins in the 50-55-kDa range. Interestingly, this group of proteins was not phosphorylated following engagement of CD3/TcR, suggesting a degree of specificity in the pattern of CD43-induced tyrosine phosphorylation. Moreover, concomitant ligation of J393/CD43 and CD3/TcR resulted in the hyperphosphorylation of these CD43-dependent substrates, providing a biochemical correlate for the synergy observed for these two receptor molecules in mediating apoptosis. Collectively, these findings suggest that protein tyrosine phosphorylation of specific substrates is important in signaling CD43-mediated apoptosis.We found that preventing dephosphorylation of phosphotyrosyl residues by blocking phosphatase activity resulted in a significant enhancement in mAb J393-induced cell death. Thus, the PTPase inhibitor BMLOV mimicked the action of CD3/TcR in potentiating CD43-mediated cell death, seemingly consistent with a hyperphosphorylated state. These results indicate that the catalytic activity of BMLOV-sensitive phosphatases negatively regulates CD43-mediated apoptosis. It is likely that the potentiation of CD43-mediated apoptosis by CD3/TcR engagement involves CD45 phosphatase activity since CD45 is expressed in high abundance in Jurkat cells and is required to activate TcR-associated SRC family kinases allowing for competent antigen-induced signal transduction (62Hovis R.R. Donovan J.A. Musci M.A. Motto D.G. Goldman F.D. Ross S.E. Koretzky G.A. Science. 1993; 260: 544-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 63Volarevic S. Niklinska B.B. Burns C.M. June C.H. Weissman A.M. Ashwell J.D. Science. 1993; 260: 541-543Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Therefore, in this context CD45 may be positively regulating CD43-mediated apoptosis by directly enhancing kinase activity. Notably, BMLOV treatment of Jurkat cells does not interfere with TcR-induced tyrosine phosphorylation (55Schieven G.L. Wahl A.F. Myrdal S. Grosmaire L. Ledbetter J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20824-20831Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) which may explain why BMLOV treatment did not block the synergism we observed for TcR/CD43-induced apoptosis. Conversely, the catalytic activity of SH2 PTPases may be expected to exert a negative regulatory effect on CD43-mediated apoptosis, since PTP1C has been shown to negatively regulate antigen receptor signaling in B-lymphocytes as confirmed in PTP1C-deficient mice expressing the motheaten phenotype (64Thomas M.L. Immunology. 1995; 7: 279-288Google Scholar). Further investigation is necessary to identify which enzymes and substrate sites are involved in this CD43-mediated pathway.It was recently reported that CD3/TcR-induced apoptosis in T-cells is mediated by the autocrine production of the ligand for CD95/Fas (FasL), thereby activating the CD95/Fas receptor signaling pathway (65Ju S.-T.

Interestingly, a requirement for tyrosine kinase activation in CD95/Fas-mediated programmed cell death has been described in conjunction with a requirement for ceramide-initiated RAS activation (66Eischen C.M. Dick C.J. Leibson P.J. J. Immunol. 1994; 153: 1947-1954PubMed Google Scholar, 67Gulbins E. Bissonnette R. Mahboubi A. Martin S. Nishioka W. Brunner T. Baier G. Baier-Bitterlich G. Byrd C. Lang F. Kolesnick R. Altman A. Green D. Immunity. 1995; 2: 341-351Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar); however, these signals alone were not sufficient for subsequent apoptosis. We found that neither a blocking antibody to CD95/Fas nor the competing fusion protein CD95/Fas-Ig prevented J393/CD43-induced apoptosis, making it unlikely that FasL was mediating this response. Moreover, we observed that combined engagement of J393/CD43-CD3/TcR leads to a rapid reduction in the nuclear localization of NF-κB and IRE regulatory proteins normally associated with transcriptional activation of the FasL gene (68Takahashi T. Int. Immunol. 1994; 6: 1567-1574Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar). Likewise, since sphingomyelinase-dependent NF-κB activation has been reported to lead to apoptosis signaled by the TNF receptor-1 “death domain” (69Wiegmann K. Schutze S. Machleidt T. Witte D. Kronke M. Cell. 1994; 78: 1005-1015Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (673) Google Scholar), it is unlikely that TNF receptor-1 is involved in J393/CD43-mediated killing. Therefore, engagement of CD43 may define a distinct signaling pathway for programmed cell death that differs from that of the TNF-nerve growth factor receptor family. Perhaps in the BMS-2 Jurkat cells, constitutive activation and nuclear localization of NF-κB and IRE DNA-binding proteins are critical for continued proliferation; hence, a decrease in nuclear localization of these transcriptional factors may lead to molecular events that promote growth arrest and eventual suicide. Recent findings in CD43-deficient T-cells generated by homologous recombination indicate that CD43 acts as a negative regulator of T-cell activation and proliferation (8Manjunath N. Correa M. Ardman M. Ardman B. Nature. 1995; 377: 535-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar), which may reflect our observation that CD43 signaling can suppress the activity of transcriptional regulators of early T-cell activation genes.While mAb J393 reacted strongly with Jurkat cell surfaces, it failed to immunostain the surface of either resting or activated peripheral blood T-lymphocytes. However, immunoblot analysis revealed the presence of several mAb J393-reactive proteins in the lysates of activated T-cells, possibly representing intracellular intermediates of CD43 in the process of O-glycan elongation. Interestingly, in activated T-cells both mAb J393 and mAb G10-2 cross-reacted with a 97-kDa isoform of CD43. Investigators have previously shown that isoform-specific antibodies may cross-react with linear protein epitopes on the deglycosylated molecule and that these epitopes may be modified by glycosylation in conferring antigenic specificity (23Cyster J.G. Shotton D.M. Williams A.F. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 893-902Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). This suggested that the antigenic specificity for these two antibodies developed as a consequence of activation-induced changes in the glycosylation of the core protein. Furthermore, the mAb J393-specific 140-kDa isoform present in Jurkat cells was replaced with a 160-kDa isoform in activated T-cells. Presumably, the J393/CD43 intermediate in T-lymphocytes contains less sialic acid than its counterpart in Jurkat cells, thus contributing to its reduced electrophoretic mobility (14Ardman B. Sikorski M.A. Settles M. Staunton D.E. J. Exp. Med. 1990; 172: 1151-1158Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Unlike T-cells from normal individuals, Jurkat cells have been shown to be deficient in β1,3-galactosyltransferase activity, a key enzyme in the formation of complex O-glycan structures (49Piller V. Piller F. Fukuda M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 9264-9271Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, we postulate that the epitope for mAb J393 is tightly regulated in T-cell lineages, normally being masked at the cell surface by the presence of complex carbohydrate chains attached to the CD43 protein.Our finding that apoptosis can be induced through a CD43-mediated pathway may have physiologic significance in peripheral lymphoid tissues such as the thymus and lymph nodes, since the inhibition of O-glycan elongation in T-cells potentiates the apoptotic effect of galectin-1, an endogenous ligand for CD43 expressed at these sites (70Perillo N.L. Pace K.E. Seilhamer J.L. Baum L.G. Nature. 1995; 378: 736-739Crossref PubMed Scopus (935) Google Scholar). Concomitant engagement of specific integrin molecules may serve to modulate CD43induced responses as our data suggest, in addition to the specific regulation of integrin expression mediated by CD43 as observed by others (71Hernandez-Caselles T. Martinez-Esparza M. Lazarovits A.I. Aparicio P. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 3668-3677PubMed Google Scholar). We propose that the truncated O-glycan structure of the J393/CD43 molecule represents a molecular phenotype with an altered affinity or specificity for natural ligands involved in cell-cell interactions and that following its ligation an apoptotic response may be triggered in appropriate cell types.As mentioned previously, abnormalities in O-glycan biosynthesis are found in a variety of pathologic conditions involving hematopoietic and immunologic disorders, often correlating with the appearance of Tn antigen and autoantibodies to cell-surface molecules including CD43 (14Ardman B. Sikorski M.A. Settles M. Staunton D.E. J. Exp. Med. 1990; 172: 1151-1158Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 18Thunher M. Rusconi S. Berger E.G. J. Clin.

These findings suggest that the expression of alternatively glycosylated isoforms of CD43 may contribute to the progression of such diseases by promoting T-cell deficiency and lymphopenia as a consequence of programmed cell death. INTRODUCTIONIn T-lymphocytes CD43/leukosialin, the major sialoglycoprotein of leukocytes (1Remold-O'Donnell E. Kenny D.M. Parkman R. Cairns L. Savage B. Rosen F.S. J. Exp. Med. 1984; 159: 1705-1723Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 2Kenny D. Cairns L. Remold-O'Donnell E. Peterson J. Rosen F.S. Parkman R. Blood. 1986; 68: 1329-1332Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), is thought to serve a dual role in regulating cellular immune responses. Due to the repulsive effect of its high numbers of O-linked negatively charged sialic acid sugar residues, CD43 acts as a “barrier molecule” by limiting cell-cell/cell-ligand interactions (3Brown W.R.A. Barclay A.N. Sunderland C.A. Williams A.F. Nature. 1981; 289: 456-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 4Rosenstein Y. Park J.K. Hahn W.C. Rosen F.S. Bierer B.E. Burakoff S.J.

Saito M. Shuichi T. Exp. Cell Res. 1994; 214: 537-542Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), a property that may negatively regulate T-cell activation (8Manjunath N. Correa M. Ardman M. Ardman B. Nature. 1995; 377: 535-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). In addition, engagement of CD43 by monoclonal antibodies has been shown to induce costimulatory activity in T-cells by a mechanism analogous to a classic ligand-receptor interaction (9Sportsman J.R. Park M.M. Cheresh D.A. Fukuda M. Elder J.H. Fox R.I. J. Immunol. 1985; 135: 158-164PubMed Google Scholar, 10Axelsson B. Youseffi-Etemad R. Hammarstrom S. Perlmann P. J.

Alterations in O-glycan structure and function of CD43 reportedly occur in the immunodeficiency disorders Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome (12Parkman R. Remold-O'Donnell E. Kenny D.M. Perrine S. Rosen F.S. Lancet. 1981; ii: 1387-1389Abstract Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 13Siminovitch K.A. Greer W.L. Axelsson B. Rubin L.A. Novogrodsky A. Peacocke M. Immunodefic.

Glycobiology. 1994; 4: 885-893Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), acute lymphocytic leukemia (17Saitoh O. Piller F. Fox R.I. Fukuda M. Blood. 1991; 77: 1491-1499Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and permanent mixed-field polyagglutinability or Tn antigen syndrome (18Thunher M. Rusconi S. Berger E.G. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 91: 2103-2110Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar).The molecular structure of human CD43 is mucin-like, consisting of an extended rod-shaped extracellular portion bearing approximately 80 sialylated O-glycan sites and a single N-glycan site, a highly conserved transmembrane region, and a long cytoplasmic domain bearing potential serine/threonine phosphorylation sites (19Shelley C.S. Remold-O'Donnell E. Davis A.E. Bruns G.A.P. Rosen F.S. Carroll M.C. Whitehead A.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 2819-2823Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Based on the exon/intron arrangement within its gene, the observed molecular heterogeneity of CD43 in both mice and man is thought to reflect differential post-translational modifications of a single gene product (20Pallant A. Eskenazi A. Mattei M.-G. Fournier R.E.K. Carlsson S.R. Fukuda M. Frelinger J.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 1328-1332Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 21Shelly C.S.

Immunol. 1990; 20: 875-881Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Linear protein epitopes in the native structure of CD43 have been shown to be modified by glycosylation (23Cyster J.G. Shotton D.M. Williams A.F. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 893-902Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar), allowing for the development of isoform-specific antibodies (9Sportsman J.R. Park M.M. Cheresh D.A. Fukuda M. Elder J.H. Fox R.I. J. Immunol. 1985; 135: 158-164PubMed Google Scholar, 11Alvarado M. Klassen C. Cerny J. Horejsi V. Schmidt R.E. Eur. J.

Following T-cell activation, the O-linked oligosaccharides of CD43 change from tetrasaccharides (mAb 1The abbreviations used are: mAbmonoclonal antibodyTcRT-cell receptorFACSfluorescence-activated cell sorterFITCfluorescein isothiocyanatePEphycoerythrinPIpropidium iodidePHAphytohemagglutininBMLOVbis(maltolato)oxovanadium-IVNFκ Bnuclear factor kappa BTNFtumor necrosis factorPBSphosphate-buffered salineMOPS3-[N-morpholino]propanesulfonic acidTricineN-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycinePTPasephosphotyrosine phosphataseIREinterferon-inducible regulatory element.

This change in oligosaccharide structure results in a shift from 115 to 140 kDa (9Sportsman J.R. Park M.M. Cheresh D.A. Fukuda M. Elder J.H. Fox R.I. J. Immunol. 1985; 135: 158-164PubMed Google Scholar, 17Saitoh O. Piller F. Fox R.I. Fukuda M. Blood. 1991; 77: 1491-1499Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 25Bierhuizen M.F.A. Maemura K. Fukuda M. J. Biol.

Immunol. 1983; 131: 762-767PubMed Google Scholar).There is little information correlating heterogeneity in oligosaccharide structure with ligand specificity or the signal transducing properties of CD43. In the thymus, thymocyte-thymic epithelial cell interactions correlate with the preferential binding of galectin-1 to the mAb T-305/CD43 isoform expressed in immature, cortical thymocytes (27Baum L.G. Pang M. Perillo N.L. Wu T. Delegeane A. Uittenbogarrt C.H. Fukuda M. Seilhamer J.J. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 181: 877-887Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). In mature T-cells the binding of anti-CD43 antibodies, thought to mimic natural ligands, results in CD28-independent costimulatory activity (11Alvarado M. Klassen C. Cerny J. Horejsi V. Schmidt R.E. Eur. J. Immunol. 1995; 25: 1051-1055Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 28Silvermann L.B. Wong R.C.K. Remold-O'Donnell E. Vercelli D. Sancho J. Terhorst C. Rosen F. Geha R. Chatila T. J.

Med. 1995; 182: 139-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the L10 antibody directed against a neuraminidase-resistant epitope of CD43 is a strong inducer of T-cell proliferation, whereas the B1B6 antibody directed against a neuraminidase-sensitive epitope is only weakly mitogenic (10Axelsson B. Youseffi-Etemad R. Hammarstrom S. Perlmann P. J. Immunol. 1988; 141: 2912-2917PubMed Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitations from T-lymphoblastoid cell lysates have found CD43 to be associated with CD3/TcR and p56LCK protein tyrosine kinase (11Alvarado M. Klassen C. Cerny J. Horejsi V. Schmidt R.E. Eur. J. Immunol. 1995; 25: 1051-1055Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), providing both physical and functional evidence for a role for CD43 in signal transduction. The anti-CD43 antibody, mAb MEM-59, which is costimulatory in T-lymphocytes has recently been reported to induce programmed cell death or apoptosis in hematopoietic progenitor cells (32Bazil V. Brandt J. Tsukamoto A. Hoffman R. Blood. 1995; 86: 502-511Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Clearly, CD43-mediated responses can differ significantly depending on the cell type and the isoform being expressed. While aberrant isoforms of CD43 have been associated with immunodeficiencies resulting in lymphopenia (33Cooper M.D. Chase H.P. Lowman J.T. Krivit W. Good R.A. Clin. Stud. 1968; 44: 499-513Google Scholar, 34Bowen D.L. Lane H.C. Fauci A.S. Ann. Intern. Med. 1985; 103: 704-709Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar), there has been no direct evidence linking CD43-mediated apoptosis with T-cell depletion.Here we report the biochemical and functional characterization of an anti-CD43 mAb designated J393 that recognizes a unique, alternatively glycosylated isoform of CD43 expressed on the surface of the human T-lymphoblastoid cell line, Jurkat. Treatment of Jurkat cells with mAb J393 induces apoptosis in a CD43 isoform-specific manner. The level of apoptosis may be enhanced by concomitant engagement of the TcR or integrin molecules. Moreover, an isoform of CD43 is detected in peripheral blood T-lymphocytes bearing a cryptic epitope for mAb J393. These results describe a potentially novel mechanism for T-cell lineage depletion involving the regulated expression of specific isoforms of CD43."
https://openalex.org/W1963552528,"The Saccharomyces cerevisiae α1,2-mannosidase, which removes one specific mannose residue from Man9GlcNAc2 to form Man8GlcNAc2, is a member of a family of α1,2-mannosidases with similar amino acid sequences. The yeast α1,2-mannosidase contains five cysteine residues, three of which are conserved. Recombinant yeast α1,2-mannosidase, produced as the soluble catalytic domain, was shown to contain two disulfide bonds and one free thiol group using 2-nitro-5-thiosulfobenzoate and 5,5′-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoate), respectively. Cys485 contains the free thiol group, as demonstrated by sequencing of labeled peptides following modification with [3H]ICH2COOH and by high performance liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry tryptic peptide mapping. A Cys340-Cys385 disulfide was demonstrated by sequencing a purified peptide containing this disulfide and by tryptic peptide mapping. Cys468 and Cys471 were not labeled with [3H]ICH2COOH and a peptide containing these two residues was identified in the tryptic peptide map, showing that Cys468 and Cys471 form the second disulfide bond. The α1,2-mannosidase loses its activity in the presence of dithiothreitol with first order kinetics, suggesting that at least one disulfide bond is essential for activity. Mutagenesis of each cysteine residue to serine showed that Cys340 and Cys385 are essential for production of recombinant enzyme, whereas Cys468, Cys471, and Cys485 are not required for production and enzyme activity. These results indicate that the sensitivity to dithiothreitol is due to reduction of the Cys340-Cys385 disulfide. Since Cys340 and Cys385 are conserved residues, it is likely that this disulfide bond is important to maintain the correct structure in the other members of the α1,2-mannosidase family.

The processing α1,2-mannosidase present in the endoplasmic reticulum of Saccharomyces cerevisiae removes one specific mannose residue from Man9GlcNAc2 to form Man8GlcNAc2 during the formation of N-linked oligosaccharides (1Jelinek-Kelly S.

Its gene (MNS1) encodes a type II membrane protein of 63 kDa with no significant cytoplasmic tail, an N-terminal transmembrane domain, and a large C-terminal catalytic domain (5Camirand A. Heysen A. Grondin B. Herscovics A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 15120-15127Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The yeast α1,2-mannosidase exhibits significant similarity in amino acid sequence and topology with α1,2-mannosidases cloned from rabbit, mouse, and human (71-73 kDa) that are essential for the formation of complex and hybrid N-linked oligosaccharides (6Bause E. Bieberich E. Rolfs A. Volker C. Schmidt B. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 217: 535-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 7Herscovics A. Schneikert J. Athanassiadis A. Moremen K.W. J. Biol.

Chem. 1994; 269: 9872-9881Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The yeast and mammalian proteins are about 35% identical in amino acid sequence in their C-terminal catalytic regions. Based on sequence homology and common properties (9Moremen K.W. Trimble R.B. Herscovics A. Glycobiology. 1994; 4: 113-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar), these enzymes were grouped as Class 1 α1,2-mannosidases. They all contain an EF-hand Ca2+ binding consensus sequence and require Ca2+ for activity. In addition, they are inhibited by 1-deoxymannojirimycin and do not use ρ-nitrophenyl-α-D-mannopyranoside as substrate. The yeast α1,2-mannosidase has a very high specificity for removal of a single mannose residue on Man9GlcNAc2, whereas the mammalian enzymes can remove up to four mannose residues from Man9GlcNAc2 to form Man5GlcNAc2. The mammalian enzymes hydrolyze α-Man1,2α-Man-OMe, whereas the yeast α1,2-mannosidase cannot hydrolyze this disaccharide. The smallest oligosaccharide substrate for the yeast α1,2-mannosidase is α-Man1,2α-Man1,3α-O(CH2)8COOCH3, but it is a very poor substrate (Km = 9 mM) (10Scaman C.H. Lipari F. Herscovics A. Glycobiology. 1996; 6: 265-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Recently, α1,2-mannosidases have also been cloned from Drosophila melanogaster (11Kerscher S. Albert S. Wucherpfennig D. Heisenberg M. Schneuwly S. Dev. Biol. 1995; 168: 613-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), Penicilium citrinum (12Yoshida T. Ichishima E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1263: 159-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), and Aspergillus saitoi (13Inoue T. Yoshida T. Ichishima E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1253: 141-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), which have similar amino acid sequences to the yeast and mammalian enzymes. The Drosophila mas-1 gene encodes two α1,2-mannosidases (72.5 and 75 kDa) that differ in their N-terminal region and have the same topology as the yeast and mammalian α1,2-mannosidases. The P. citrinum and A. saitoi α1,2-mannosidase genes encode secreted proteins of 56-57 kDa with a cleavable signal peptide. Unlike the other members of this family, they do not contain an EF-hand Ca2+ binding consensus sequence and do not require Ca2+ for activity. Little is known about the structure and mechanism of catalysis of any of the Class 1 α1, 2-mannosidases (recently named Family 47 in the classification of glycosyl hydrolases in Release 34.0 of the SWISS-PROT Protein Sequence Data Bank), and the three-dimensional structure is not known. Until recently, a major difficulty has been the purification of sufficient enzyme for study. However, we can now produce milligram quantities of the catalytic domain of the yeast α1,2-mannosidase (14Lipari F. Herscovics A. Glycobiology. 1994; 4: 697-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The yeast processing α1,2-mannosidase is the first member of this family that can be produced in sufficient quantity to study its structure and its mechanism of catalysis, and we have shown recently that it is a glycosidase of the inverting type (15Lipari F. Gour-Salin B.J. Herscovics A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 209: 322-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). In the present work we demonstrate that the yeast α1,2-mannosidase has two disulfide bonds and one sulfhydryl group in its catalytic domain. Their location is documented by peptide analysis, and their respective roles in enzyme activity is established by site-directed mutagenesis. Only one of these two disulfide bonds is essential for catalytic activity, and the free sulfhydryl residue is not required.

Escherichia coli DH5α and DH10 were used as the host for plasmid manipulations. The plasmid pBS9.5 contains the whole open reading frame of the MNS1 gene in pBluescript (16Grondin B. Herscovics A. Glycobiology. 1992; 2: 369-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The following oligonucleotides were used to isolate the DNA sequence encoding the catalytic domain (nucleotides 64-1651 corresponding to amino acids 22-549) of the α1,2-mannosidase from pBS9.5 by PCR: (i) a sense 5′ oligonucleotide ATACTCGAGTGCCATGGTACGAACACTTTG containing an XhoI site and (ii) a 3′ antisense oligonucleotide GGTGGATCCCTACAACGACCAACCTGTG containing a BamHI site. Preparative PCR was carried out as described previously (14Lipari F. Herscovics A. Glycobiology. 1994; 4: 697-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The specific PCR product was digested with XhoI and BamHI and ligated into the XhoI/BamHI sites of the pHIL-S1 vector to produce the plasmid YpHMNS1. Cysteine to serine mutations were accomplished by the unique site elimination procedure (17Deng W.P. Nickoloff J.A. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 200: 81-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (1079) Google Scholar) (U.S.E. mutagenesis kit, Pharmacia) using the plasmid YpHMNS1 and the following oligonucleotides: GACCACCTCGTAAGCTTTATGGG for the C340S mutation, GGGATAACTGACACTAGTTATCAAATGTACAAGC for C385S, CTTTGAAAATACTAGTGTTGATTGTAATGACCC for C468S, CTGTGTTGATTCTAATGACCCAAAATTAAGG for C471S, and GGCGGTTCACTAGTTTAAGTGATTCTATCACGTTACCTAC for C485S. The plasmids YpHC340S, YpHC385S, YpHC468S, YpHC471S, and YpHC485S were thus constructed from the wild type YpHMNS1 plasmid. The entire coding region of all the constructs was sequenced by the dideoxy method (18Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52771) Google Scholar). The secreted recombinant α1,2-mannosidase lacking the transmembrane domain was produced using two different yeast expression systems, one in S. cerevisiae as already described (14Lipari F. Herscovics A. Glycobiology. 1994; 4: 697-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) and the other in P. pastoris. BglII-digested plasmids were transformed by the spheroplast method or by electroporation into the P. pastoris strains GS115 (his4) or KM71 (his4, aox1) as described in the Pichia expression kit manual obtained from Invitrogen. Histidine-independent transformants were selected and subsequently screened for methanol utilization when the GS115 strain was used. Use of the KM71 strain does not require selection for methanol utilization. BMGY and BMMY media were prepared according to the Pichia expression kit manual. His+, Mut− yeast cells were grown at 30°C (250-300 rpm) for 48 h in BMGY medium (buffered with 100 mM potassium phosphate, pH 6.0), and then centrifuged and resuspended with BMMY medium (buffered with 100 mM potassium phosphate, pH 6.0) in 20-40% of the original volume, and incubated for an additional 1-4 days at 30°C (250-300 rpm). If the cells were induced for more than 2 days, methanol was added to a final concentration of 0.5% (v/v) after 2 days of induction. Cells were separated from the medium by centrifugation. In order to screen for clones expressing α1,2-mannosidase, 5 μl of medium were assayed for α1,2-mannosidase activity. The assay mixture contained 8700 dpm [3H]Glc1Man9GlcNAc, 1 mg/ml BSA, 0.1 M PIPES (pH 6.5), and 1 mM sodium azide in a total volume of 20 μl and was incubated for 1 h at 37°C. In order to screen for intracellular expression of recombinant enzyme, the cells were vortexed 4-5 min at 4°C in the presence of glass beads in 10 mM sodium phosphate buffer, pH 6.8, containing 1 mM sodium azide. Glass beads, buffer, and cells were added in a ratio of 1:1:0.5. The glass beads were allowed to settle, and aliquots of the supernatants were analyzed by Western blotting. Recombinant α1,2-mannosidase was purified by S-Sepharose chromatography or by sequential S-Sepharose and Q-Sepharose chromatography as described previously (15Lipari F. Gour-Salin B.J. Herscovics A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 209: 322-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Unless otherwise indicated, enzyme samples were diluted in 10 mM PIPES (pH 6.5) containing 1 mg/ml BSA and 7.5 μl were assayed under standard conditions with 0.2 mM Man9GlcNAc (17,400 dpm [3H]Man9GlcNAc) as described previously (14Lipari F. Herscovics A. Glycobiology. 1994; 4: 697-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Km values for the mutant and wild type enzymes present in the medium were determined as described previously (14Lipari F. Herscovics A. Glycobiology. 1994; 4: 697-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The disulfide bonds were quantitated using 2-nitro-5-thiosulfobenzoate, which was synthesized from DTNB (19Thannhauser T.W. Konishi Y. Scheraga H.A. Anal. Biochem. 1984; 138: 181-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). The reaction was carried out in a solution of pH 9.5 containing 0.2 M Tris-HCl, 0.1 M sodium sulfite, 3 mM EDTA, 3 M guanidine thiocyanate, and 0.5 mM NTSB. 100 μl of the reagent solution were added to the protein solution (7-15 μl containing 26-147 μg of α1,2-mannosidase). The reaction was monitored at 412 nm until a constant absorbance reading was achieved (45-90 min). The free sulfhydryl groups were quantitated using 5,5′-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoate) (20Jocelyn P.C. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 143: 44-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). The protein was prepared in 50 mM sodium phosphate (pH 7.8) containing 2% SDS and 1 mM sodium azide, and then heated at 50°C for 30 min. 50 μl of protein solution, containing 73-165 μg of α1,2-mannosidase, were added to 50 μl of reagent containing 1 mM DTNB, 6 mM EDTA, 50 mM sodium phosphate (pH 7.8), and 1 mM sodium azide, and the absorbance was monitored at 412 nm for 20 min. Recombinant α1,2-mannosidase (1.2 mg) in 2 mM sodium phosphate (pH 6.8), 1 mM sodium azide was lyophilized. Reaction with iodoacetic acid was carried out according to Carr et al. (21Carr S.A. Barr J.R. Roberts G.D. Anumula K.R. Taylor P.B. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 193: 508Google Scholar), with a few modifications. Iodoacetic acid (recrystallized in chloroform) was added to a final concentration of 0.1 M in 0.5 M Tris-HCl (pH 8.2), containing 2 mM EDTA and 6 M Gdn-HCl. The pH was adjusted to 8.2 with ammonium hydroxide and the solution was purged with nitrogen. 500 μCi of dried 2-[3H]ICH2COOH (172 mCi/mmol, Amersham) were added to 2.4 ml of this solution, and this was then added to the lyophilized protein. The reaction was carried out on ice in the dark under a nitrogen atmosphere for 140 min. Three ml of 1% acetic acid were added to stop the reaction, and the sample was extensively dialyzed against 1% acetic acid (six changes of 1.0 liter) and lyophilized. Reaction with unlabeled 0.1 M iodoacetate was performed as above. Lyophilized α1,2-mannosidase was treated with a 100- or 500-fold molar excess (with respect to methionine content) of CNBr in 6 M Gdn-HCl/0.2 M HCl (22Villa S. DeFazio G. Canosi U. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 177: 161-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The reaction was allowed to proceed for 24 h in the dark at room temperature, 1 ml of water was added, and the sample was lyophilized. One ml of water was added again and the sample was lyophilized and then stored at −80°C. CNBr-treated peptides were fractionated on a Sephadex G-50 column (1 × 120 cm) using 0.1 M or 0.2 M acetic acid as solvent, monitoring the eluent at 230 nm. Five included peptide fractions, P1-P5, were collected in their order of elution. Aliquots from each of these fractions were subjected to HPLC before and after reduction. A set of peptides eluting between 44 and 48 min in fraction P3, and to a lesser extent in fraction P2, were observed to shift upon reduction. None of the other fractions (P1, P4, or P5) contained peptides that changed elution position upon reduction. For endoprotease Asp-N digestion, peptides were dried under a nitrogen stream and were then dissolved in 50 mM potassium phosphate (pH 6.0), 0.1 M Gdn-HCl at 1.25 μg/μl and treated with 0.8 μg of endoprotease Asp-N/100 μg of peptides for 16 h at 37°C. Gdn-HCl was added to help solubilize the peptides. Glacial acetic acid was added to a final concentration of 10% (v/v) to stop the reaction, and the sample was stored at −20°C. For endoprotease Glu-C digestion, peptides were lyophilized and resuspended in 30 mM sodium phosphate (pH 7.8), containing 1.2 M urea and 2 mM EDTA. Urea was added to help solubilize the peptides. The peptides were digested at a concentration of 1.5 μg/μl with endoprotease Glu-C at a concentration of 13 μg/100 μg of peptides. The digestion was allowed to proceed for 24 h at 25°C and terminated by the addition of glacial acetic acid to 10% (v/v). The sample was stored at −20°C. For trypsin digestion, recombinant α1,2-mannosidase was lyophilized and resuspended in 8 M urea, 0.1 M potassium phosphate (pH 6.5) at a concentration of 5 μg/μl. The protein was denatured by sonication for 1 min followed by incubation at 37°C for 5 min. This was repeated three times. The solution was then incubated at 37°C for 30 min. An equal volume of 0.1 M potassium phosphate buffer (pH 6.5) was then added before the addition of 1 μl of trypsin. TPCK-treated trypsin was prepared in 0.1 mM HCl and was added to yield a final concentration of 5 μg/100 μg of α1,2-mannosidase. The digestion was allowed to proceed at 37°C for 5 h and stopped by freezing at −80°C. For the reduced sample, 4 times the volume of 0.5 M Tris-HCl (pH 8.5) containing 0.375 M DTT was added to an aliquot of the trypsin-digested α1,2-mannosidase and the mixture was incubated at 37°C for 10 min, then stored immediately at −80°C. For reduction of CNBr-treated and endoprotease Asp-N-digested peptides, peptide solutions were dried in a vacuum concentrator (Savant), then reconstituted with 150 μl of 50 mM DTT in 0.5 M Tris-HCl (pH 8.5) containing 6 M Gdn-HCl (23Schmelzer C.H. Harris R.J. Butler D. Yedinak C.M. Wagner K.L. Burton L.E. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 302: 484-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The mixture was incubated at 37°C for 4 h. An identical sample lacking DTT was treated in the same way. The reaction was stopped by adding 15 μl of glacial acetic acid and 40 μl of 0.1% aqueous trifluoroacetic acid. A Varian model 5020 HPLC system equipped with a reverse-phase C4 column (4.6 mm (inner diameter) × 25 cm, 10 μm, Vydac) was employed for peptide separations. Solvent A was 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in water, and solvent B contained 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, 95% acetonitrile, and 5% water. The sample was injected, and solvent A was passed through the column for 5 min. The peptides were eluted with a linear gradient of 0-60% B over 60 min at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. 5 μg of trypsin-digested α1,2-mannosidase (reduced or non-reduced) were fractionated on a microbore C18 column (1 mm (inner diameter) × 25 cm, 5 μm, Vydac), which was on-line with a Finnigan SSQ 7000 mass spectrometer equipped with an electrospray ionization source. A Hewlett Packard model 1090 HPLC system was used, and a discontinuous gradient was employed for elution: 5% B at 0 min, 33% B at 63 min, 60% B at 95 min, and 80% B at 105 min, using 0.05% trifluoroacetic acid/water as buffer A and 0.05% trifluoroacetic acid/acetonitrile as buffer B. The mass analysis was set at 5 s/scan with a range of 300-2500 m/z. The flow rate was 40 μl/min for the non-reduced sample and 30 μl/min for the reduced sample. For the non-reduced sample, mass data were collected 5 min after the gradient started. For the reduced sample, data collection started 10 min later. The concentration of purified recombinant α1,2-mannosidase was quantitated using the absorbance at 280 nm as described (24Mach H. Middaugh C.R. Lewis R.V. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 200: 74-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar) or the Micro BCA reagent kit from Pierce. Peptide concentration was determined using a modified Lowry method (25Markwell M.A.K. Haas S.M. Tolbert N.E. Bieber L.L. Methods Enzymol. 1981; 72: 296-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (724) Google Scholar). SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions was carried out according to Laemmli (26Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207538) Google Scholar) using the Bio-Rad Mini-PROTEAN II apparatus. For Western blotting, proteins were transferred onto nitrocellulose membrane (Schleicher & Schuell) and visualized by the ECL Western blotting detection system (Amersham) using rabbit polyclonal antiserum raised against the purified soluble yeast α1,2-mannosidase (14Lipari F. Herscovics A. Glycobiology. 1994; 4: 697-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) or against recombinant yeast α1,2-mannosidase (4Burke J. Lipari F. Igdoura S. Herscovics A. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 70: 298-305PubMed Google Scholar). N-terminal sequencing was performed at Queen's University (Kingston, Canada) on an Applied Biosystems model 473A sequenator equipped with an on-line microgradient phenylthiodantoin analysis system or at the Sheldon Biotechnology Centre (McGill University, Montréal, Canada) on a Beckman integrated microsequencing system, model PI2090E, equipped with an on-line HP1090 HPLC. For amino acid composition analysis, peptides were subjected to constant boiling hydrochloric acid (about 6 N) vapor hydrolysis for 16-24 h at 110°C using a Pico-Tag workstation (Waters), and amino acid analysis was performed on a Beckman 6300 series autoanalyzer. The amino acids were separated by ion-exchange chromatography, and ninhydrin post-column detection/quantitation was used. In order to obtain sufficient protein for structural analysis, the catalytic domain of the yeast α1,2-mannosidase was cloned downstream of the PHO1 signal peptide and strong alcohol oxidase (AOX1) promoter in the pHIL-S1 vector. The construct was introduced into the P. pastoris genome by homologous recombination. Expression from P. pastoris was induced with methanol, and the recombinant α1,2-mannosidase was secreted into the medium. Different clones expressed different amounts of α1,2-mannosidase, but the highest yield obtained using this system was 30 mg/liter of purified recombinant enzyme, which is 50 times more than was produced in S. cerevisiae as described previously (0.6 mg/liter) (14Lipari F. Herscovics A. Glycobiology. 1994; 4: 697-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Recombinant α1,2-mannosidase produced from S. cerevisiae had been shown to have similar properties as the native α1,2-mannosidase (14Lipari F. Herscovics A. Glycobiology. 1994; 4: 697-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), and the recombinant α1,2-mannosidase from P. pastoris has the same specific activity and Km as the enzyme produced in S. cerevisiae (data not shown). The yeast α1,2-mannosidase contains five cysteine residues in its catalytic domain. NTSB in the presence of sodium sulfite was used to quantitate the number of disulfides plus free sulfhydryl groups. The protein was reduced with sodium sulfite releasing one thiol per disulfide bond, and NTSB reacts with free thiols to produce one NTB per free thiol. Reaction with α1,2-mannosidase yielded a value of 2.7 ± 0.4 NTB molecules/protein molecule. DTNB was used to quantitate free sulfhydryl groups. A value of 1.1 ± 0.1 sulfhydryl group/α1,2-mannosidase molecule was obtained. In addition, carboxymethylation with iodoacetate under denaturing conditions resulted in 0.85 CM-Cys/protein molecule as determined by amino acid composition. These results demonstrate that there is one free sulfhydryl group and two disulfide bonds in the yeast α1,2-mannosidase. The importance of the disulfide bonds and the free sulfhydryl group in the yeast α1,2-mannosidase was investigated. It was found that purified recombinant α1,2-mannosidase loses about 90% activity when incubated for 9 h with 10 mM DTT (Fig. 1). The rate of inactivation clearly shows first order kinetics, suggesting that reduction of one of the two disulfide bonds was likely to cause the loss of enzyme activity. No change in the migration of the protein on SDS-PAGE was observed during this treatment with DTT. These results demonstrate that at least one disulfide bond is essential to maintain α1,2-mannosidase activity. Treatment of the α1,2-mannosidase with the sulfhydryl specific reagents N-ethylmaleimide, ρ-chloromercuribenzoate, iodoacetate, and iodoacetamide under native conditions did not affect enzyme activity (data not shown). The protein was labeled with radioactive iodoacetate to identify the cysteine containing the free sulfhydryl group. Labeling was carried out by adding Gdn-HCl and iodoacetate simultaneously to the dried protein in order to minimize disulfide exchange. The CNBr-digested protein was fractionated by gel filtration (Fig. 2). There was one major radioactive peptide fraction (C1) that contained about 43% of the radioactivity expected to be incorporated as CM-Cys. The radioactive peptides that were eluted between fractions 32 and 45 were larger than 10 kDa due to incomplete digestion with CNBr. The peptides in fractions 75 and 85 contained only about 10% of the recovered radioactivity. Fraction C1 was treated with endoprotease Glu-C, under conditions in which the enzyme would cleave after both aspartic and glutamic acid residues (27Sorensen S.B. Sorensen T.L. Breddam K. FEBS Lett. 1991; 294: 195-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), in order to obtain peptides containing only one cysteine residue according to the amino acid sequence. HPLC of the undigested peptides showed that all of the radioactivity was eluted with a peak at about 48 min (Fig. 3). HPLC of an aliquot of the endoprotease Glu-C-digested peptides showed radioactive fractions eluting with peaks at about 31 and 40 min. Preparative HPLC was carried out on the remaining digest, and the fractions expected to contain radioactivity were collected manually. About 64% of the radioactivity was eluted as a doublet at about 31 min, about 30% was eluted at about 40 min, and 5% did not bind to the column. Fractions g1 and g2 were analyzed by N-terminal sequencing, collecting fractions for radioactivity measurement. The two fractions were found to contain the same radiolabeled peptide. The N-terminal sequence for the peptide in fraction g1 is shown in Table I. The radioactivity elutes with the CM-Cys in the first cycle and the peptide was identified as: 485CM-Cys-ITLPTKKSNN-Hse496. The peptide contains homoserine at its C terminus and was eluted from the column as a doublet due to the equilibrium between homoserine and homoserine lactone (28Gross E.

https://openalex.org/W1974572176,"We previously cloned a cDNA encoding a protein tyrosine phosphatase (PTP) containing sequence homology to protein 4.1, designated PTPMEG. Recombinant protein and amino- and carboxyl-terminal peptides were used to obtain polyclonal antibodies against PTPMEG to identify endogenous PTPMEG in A172 cells and to show that the enzyme is primarily localized to the membrane and cytoskeletal fractions of these cells. We prepared recombinant protein in Sf9 and COS-7 cells to further characterize it. The protein was phosphorylated in both cell types on serine and threonine residues. The multiple sites of phosphorylation were all within the intermediate domain of the protein between amino acids 386 and 503. This region also contains two PEST sequences and two proline-rich motifs that may confer binding to Src homology 3 domains. The recombinant protein was cleaved by trypsin and calpain in this region and thereby activated 4-8-fold as assayed using Raytide as substrate. We immunoprecipitated the protein from human platelets with both amino- and carboxyl-terminal antipeptide antibodies to assess the state of the enzyme in these cells. The full-length molecule was found in extracts from unstimulated platelets, whereas extracts from both calcium ionophore- and thrombin-treated platelets contained proteolyzed and activated forms of the enzyme, indicating that proteolysis by calpain is evoked in response to thrombin.

https://openalex.org/W2072208750,"Several studies have demonstrated the presence of oligomers of P-glycoprotein in multidrug-resistant cells. The minimum functional unit of P-glycoprotein, however, is not known. In order to determine whether the functional unit is an oligomer, we tested for associations between P-glycoproteins containing either a histidine tag or the epitope tag for monoclonal antibody A52 at the COOH-terminal end of the molecule. Both tagged molecules were active and had indistinguishable drug resistance profiles. The tagged P-glycoproteins were expressed contemporaneously in HEK 293 cells, purified by nickel-chelate chromatography followed by immunoblot analysis. We found that P-glycoprotein-A52 did not copurify with functionally active P-glycoprotein-(His)10, even when the former was overexpressed relative to the histidine-tagged protein. Similar results were obtained with phosphorylation-deficient mutants of P-glycoprotein. By contrast, we could purify and reconstitute drug-stimulated ATPase activity when the half-molecules NH2-terminal half-(His)10/COOH-terminal half-A52 or NH2-terminal half-A52/COOH-terminal half-(His)10 were coexpressed in HEK 293 cells. These results suggest that nickel-chelate chromatography may be a suitable method for studying protein-protein interactions in membrane proteins and that the minimal functional unit of P-glycoprotein is likely to be a monomer."

Neither the full-length α subunit nor any of the fragments were expressed on the cell surface, although the shortest folded fragment lacking a transmembrane domain was secreted into the medium.

N-terminal δ subunit fragments gave similar results. An N-terminal δ subunit fragment that contains M1 associated with the α subunit to form a heterodimer, while a fragment lacking M1 did not.

Neuron. 1990; 5: 383-392Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). All members of the family are thought to have a common pentameric structure in which highly homologous subunits surround a central aqueous pore whose opening and closing is regulated by binding of the neurotransmitter ligand (2Galzi J.F.

The muscle receptor consists of four different subunits in the ratio α2:β:γ:δ (5Karlin A. Harvey Lect. 1991; 85: 71-107Google Scholar, 6Karlin A. Akabas M.H. Neuron. 1995; 15: 1231-1244Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (566) Google Scholar). Each of the subunits is separately synthesized and translocated into the endoplasmic reticulum, where AChR assembly occurs (7Anderson M.J. Blobel G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 5598-5602Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 8Smith M.M. Lindstrom J. Merlie J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 4367-4376Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9Gu Y.

Before assembly, the α subunit undergoes a folding reaction whose product can be recognized by its ability to bind α-bungarotoxin (α-BuTx) (10Merlie J.P. Lindstrom J. Cell. 1983; 34: 747-757Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 11Carlin, B. E., Merlie, J. P., Strauss, A.

Chem. 1988; 263: 1072-1080Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The other subunits also presumably undergo folding reactions before assembly, although the intermediates have not been characterized. Association of the folded subunits to form the assembled receptor occurs by a defined pathway in which the first step is the formation of the heterodimers αδ and αγ (13Blount P. McHardy M.S.

The binding of the α subunit to the δ and γ subunits results in the formation of a ligand-binding site within each heterodimer. Each site is characterized by distinctive properties that correspond to those in the intact AChR (6Karlin A. Akabas M.H. Neuron. 1995; 15: 1231-1244Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (566) Google Scholar, 17Blount P. Merlie J.P. Neuron. 1989; 3: 349-357Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). Several observations suggest that the binding site for competitive antagonists occurs at or near the interface between α and δ subunits or α and γ subunits, respectively (18Pederson S.E. Cohen J.B.

In previous experiments, we have sought to define the domains of the AChR subunits that participate in the subunit interactions required for heterodimer formation. Chimeric subunits and dominant negative experiments were used to show that the N-terminal domains of the AChR mediate the specific interactions between the subunits and give them their identity in the assembly reaction (21Yu X.-M. Hall Z.W. Nature. 1991; 352: 64-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 22Yu X.-M. Hall Z.W. Mol. Pharmacol. 1994; 46: 964-969PubMed Google Scholar, 23Verrall S. Hall Z.W. Cell. 1992; 68: 23-31Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). In addition, by comparing subunits of different species, we identified amino acid residues in the N-terminal domains that affect the efficiency of assembly (24Gu Y. Camacho P. Gardner P. Hall Z.W. Neuron. 1991; 6: 879-887Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 25Chavez R.A. Maloof J. Beeson D. Newsom-Davis J. Hall Z.W. J. Biol.

Neuron. 1995; 14: 635-644Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) have identified a specific region in the N terminus of the γ subunit that apparently mediates contact with the α subunit. In the present experiments, we have sought the minimal domains of the α and δ subunits that are necessary for folding and for specific subunit association in vivo. By expressing truncated N-terminal fragments of the α and δ subunits in COS cells, we found that, although the N-terminal extracellular domain of the α subunit folds in vivo, heterodimer formation between truncated subunits requires the first transmembrane domains (M1) of both α and δ subunits. Our results suggest that the soluble N-terminal sequence plus a complete M1 segment in the α and δ subunits are the minimal structural units required to form a ligand-binding site in vivo whose pharmacological properties mimic those of the functional surface AChR pentamer. An incomplete M1 domain is adequate for the retention of proteins in the ER, but is not sufficient to promote assembly. Full-length cDNAs coding for the α, β, and δ subunits of the mouse muscle AChR were kindly provided by Drs. J. P. Merlie and N. Davidson (27Isenberg K.E. Mudd J. Shah V. Merlie J.P.

A. 1984; 81: 7970-7974Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). The full-length cDNA for the mouse ϵ subunit was previously isolated in our own laboratory (24Gu Y. Camacho P. Gardner P. Hall Z.W. Neuron. 1991; 6: 879-887Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Each of the cDNAs was subcloned into the multiple cloning sites of a SV40-based expression vector, pSM (30Brodsky M.H. Warton M. Myers R.M. Littman D.R. J. Immunol. 1990; 144: 3078-3086PubMed Google Scholar). All amino acids were numbered according to their position in the mature protein sequence of the given subunit. The cDNA constructs α207 and αM1, which encode α subunit N-terminal fragments terminated immediately after amino acid 207 and after the first putative transmembrane domain, M1 (amino acid 241), respectively, were obtained from Drs. P. Blount and J. P. Merlie (Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, MO). The construct α216 was created by inserting the EcoRI-HincII fragment of α subunit cDNA into the EcoRI site in pSM and a filled-in SalI site. α216 expresses an α subunit fragment containing the N-terminal extracellular domain (amino acid 210) plus the first 6 amino acids of M1 followed by serine and threonine residues generated in the cloning. The construct α211, encoding the entire N-terminal extracellular portion of the α subunit (up to amino acid 211), was made by amplification of the corresponding sequences in the full-length α subunit cDNA using polymerase chain reactions. The constructs δ224, which encodes the entire N-terminal extracellular portion of the δ subunit (up to amino acid 224), and δM1, which encodes the entire N-terminal extracellular portion and the first transmembrane domain of the δ subunit (up to amino acid 256), were made by amplification of their corresponding sequences in the full-length δ subunit cDNA with the polymerase chain reaction, respectively. To create truncated fragment δM4, full-length δ subunit cDNA was terminated by a novel stop codon installed at the position immediately after the fourth transmembrane domain (amino acid 470) using site-directed mutagenesis (Transform Mutagenesis kit, CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA). Synthetic oligonucleotide primers for the polymerase chain reaction and mutagenesis were obtained from a commercial source (Integrated DNA Technology, Coralville, IA). Epitope-tagged δ224 and δM1 were also produced as fusion proteins with the FLAG peptide (δ224-FLAG) and the hemagglutinin sequence (δM1-HA) by polymerase chain reaction, respectively (see Fig. 1B) (31Hopp T.P.

The polyclonal antiserum SFH-δN was raised by immunizing a rabbit with a purified, denatured N-terminal fragment of the mouse δ subunit (δ224) overexpressed in bacteria. 2S. F. Hardy and Z. W. Hall, unpublished data. The mouse hybridoma cell line secreting a monoclonal antibody against the hemagglutinin epitope was originated from Wilson et al. (32Wilson I.A. Niman H.L. Houghten R.A. Cherenson A.R. Connolly M.L. Lerner R.A. Cell. 1984; 37: 767-778Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (658) Google Scholar). Mouse anti-FLAG M2 monoclonal antibody was purchased from Eastman Kodak Co. An adenovirus-aided DEAE transfection procedure was adopted to introduce the expression vectors into COS cells (36Forsayeth J.R. Garcia P.D. BioTechniques. 1994; 17: 354-358PubMed Google Scholar). For a 10-cm dish of cells, 5.0 ml of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM H-21), 1.0 ml of Adgpt lysate (an E1-defective adenovirus), 240 µg of DEAE-dextran, and the appropriate amount of plasmid DNA were mixed and added to cells at ∼60% confluence. For experiments in which only one or two subunits were expressed, 5 µg of each plasmid was used. For analysis of cell-surface AChR expression, cDNAs for α, β, ϵ, and δ subunits were added in the amounts of 1.32, 0.66, 1.0, and 0.26 µg/6-cm dish, respectively (14Gu Y. Forsayeth J.R. Verrall S. Yu X.-M. Hall Z.W. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 114: 799-807Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). After 2 h of incubation in a CO2 incubator at 37°C, the transfection mixture was aspirated, and the cells were rinsed with PBS before being returned to the incubator in 10 ml of growth medium (10% fetal bovine serum in DMEM H-21 supplemented with 2 mM glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 units/ml streptomycin). To estimate the relative amount of expressed α subunit converted to the toxin binding conformation and to examine if truncated α fragments are secreted, COS cells were metabolically labeled 48 h post-transfection. Briefly, after a 30-min incubation at 37°C in cysteine- and methionine-free DMEM H-21, COS cells were labeled for 10 min with cysteine- and methionine-free DMEM H-21 containing 200 µCi/ml Tran35S-label (1159 Ci/mmol; ICN Biochemicals, Costa Mesa, CA). The cells were washed with DMEM H-21 supplemented with 2 mg/ml each cysteine and methionine and then chased for the times specified with DMEM H-21 containing 10% fetal calf serum. At the end of the chase period, the medium was collected, and the cells were scraped off the dish with ice-cold PBS, pelleted, and solubilized in a Triton X-100-containing extraction buffer (23Verrall S. Hall Z.W. Cell. 1992; 68: 23-31Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 25Chavez R.A. Maloof J. Beeson D. Newsom-Davis J. Hall Z.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23028-23034Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The cell lysate was pelleted to remove insoluble materials. The chase medium and the cleared detergent extract were evenly divided, and individual aliquots were assayed for expressed α subunit by immunoprecipitation with mAb 210 and precipitation with α-BuTx coupled to Sepharose 4B. Immunoprecipitation experiments showed that α-BuTx-Sepharose quantitatively removed all 125I-α-BuTx binding activity from the samples. The precipitations were performed for 2 h at 4°C with agitation. A rabbit anti-rat secondary antibody and protein A coupled to Sepharose were used to precipitate the mAb 210-containing samples. The Sepharose pellets were washed three times with 50 mM Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.4) containing 0.5 M NaCl and 1% Triton X-100. The samples were heated for 5 min at 100°C in gel loading buffer containing 5%β-mecaptoethanol and electrophoresed through 12.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. The gels were dried, fluorographed, and exposed to Kodak BioMax film. The relative optical density of the protein bands on the film was semiquantified using the software NIH Image following scanning of the properly exposed films into a computer. Throughout this process, all samples were handled identically. Twenty-four hours after transfection, COS cells were trypsinized and distributed into 12-well (2.5 cm) tissue culture plates. After an additional 24 h in culture, surface expression of α-BuTx-binding sites was determined by incubating intact cells in the plates for 90 min at 37°C with 4 nM [125I]-α-BuTx (220 Ci/mmol; Amersham Corp.) in DMEM H-21. Unbound α-BuTx was then removed by washing the cells with PBS. The amount of bound toxin was determined by solubilizing the cells in 0.1 N NaOH and measuring the radioactivity with a γ-counter. To measure the expression of species that did not reach the cell surface, toxin binding assays were performed on COS cells permeabilized with saponin (13Blount P. McHardy M.S. Merlie J.P. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 2601-2611Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 17Blount P. Merlie J.P. Neuron. 1989; 3: 349-357Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). 125I-α-BuTx (4 nM) was applied in 10 mM HEPES buffer (pH 7.4), 0.1% saponin (Sigma), and 0.5% bovine serum album, and the cells were incubated on ice for 90 min. The cells were then washed with the same buffer without α-BuTx, solubilized in 0.1 N NaOH, and counted in a γ-counter. Nonspecific binding was measured by including a 100-fold excess of unlabeled α-BuTx (Sigma) in the assay mixture or by sham transfection. Each assay was performed in triplicate. Immunoprecipitation of heterodimers with subunit-specific antibodies was performed as described previously (23Verrall S. Hall Z.W. Cell. 1992; 68: 23-31Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Forty-eight hours after transfection, COS cells were scraped off the dish and pelleted by centrifugation. The medium was collected, and the cells were solubilized in 0.4 ml of extraction buffer containing 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 50 mM NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM EGTA, 1 mM sodium tetrathionate, 1 mM N-ethylmaleimide, 1 mM benzamidine, 0.4 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 20 µg/ml leupeptin, 10 µg/ml pepstatin, and 10 units of aprotinin. Cell lysate supernatant (0.04 ml) was mixed with 4 nM125I-α-BuTx and 80 nM primary antibody, adjusted to a final volume of 0.5 ml with extraction buffer, and incubated for 1 h on ice. Two microliters of rabbit anti-rat (for mAb 210) or rabbit anti-mouse (for mAb 88B, anti-FLAG mAb, and anti-HA mAb) secondary antisera (Cappel Research Products, Durham, NC) was then added to each sample. Following another 1-h incubation on ice, 50 µl of standardized Pansorbin cells (10% suspension of fixed Staphylococcus aureus cells, Calbiochem) was added to the sample and continuously mixed in a rotatory mixer for 30 min at 4°C. The Pansorbin cells were then washed with extraction buffer (without protease inhibitors), pelleted by centrifugation, and counted for radioactivity in a γ-counter. Control immunoprecipitation experiments were carried out using sham-transfected cells. The ligand-binding site of α and δ heterodimers was determined by measuring the inhibition of 125I-α-BuTx binding by d-tubocurarine (dTC) (17Blount P. Merlie J.P. Neuron. 1989; 3: 349-357Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitation assays were carried out with the following modifications. Primary antibodies (mAb 88B, anti-FLAG mAb, and anti-HA mAb) were first incubated with cell extracts for 1 h on ice. Secondary antibodies and dTC were added to the samples 30 min prior to addition/incubation with 125I-α-BuTx (30-min incubation) and with Pansorbin cells (30-min incubation). Transfected COS cells were homogenized in ice-cold Tris buffer (50 mM, pH 7.4) with protease inhibitors in glass grinders. The homogenates were centrifuged (12,000 rpm) at 4°C for 5 min to remove the nuclei. Supernatants were collected and incubated with 1 M sucrose (in Tris buffer (pH 7.4)) or 1 M Na2CO3 (pH 11) on ice for 15 min. The samples were then separated by ultracentrifugation at 50,000 rpm in a Beckman Ti-70 rotor for 1 h at 4°C. The pellets were dissolved directly in reducing SDS-PAGE sample buffer. Proteins in the supernatant fraction were precipitated with trichloroacetic acid. They were then applied to a 10% reducing SDS-polyacrylamide gel and immunoblotted with mAb 210 (38Chavez R.A. Hall Z.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 15532-15538Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 41Fujiki Y. Hubbard A.L. Fowler S. Lazarow P.B. J Cell Biol. 1982; 93: 97-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (1385) Google Scholar). Transfected COS cells were harvested as described above and lysed in extraction buffer. Cell lysates were layered on top of a continuous 5-20% sucrose gradient with bovine alkaline phosphatase (6.3 S) and, in some tubes, bovine hemoglobin (4.3 S) included as markers. Gradients were centrifuged at 65,000 rpm in a Beckman VTi-65 rotor for 90 min at 4°C (23Verrall S. Hall Z.W. Cell. 1992; 68: 23-31Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar) and then collected from the bottom of the tubes in fractions of 120 µl. Each of the fractions was analyzed by immunoprecipitation with subunit-specific antibodies as described above. Proteins in COS cell extracts or culture media were denatured in reducing gel loading buffer, electrophoresed on a 12.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel (39Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar), and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. Nonspecific binding to the membranes was blocked by incubation in blocking buffer (10% calf serum and 3% bovine serum albumin in PBS and 0.3% Tween 20). The membranes were then incubated with the primary antibodies in the same blocking buffer, washed with PBS/Tween 20, and incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies. After extensive washing in PBS and 0.3% Tween 20, the bound antibodies were detected with enhanced chemiluminescent reagents (ECL, Amersham Corp.) by exposure to Kodak BioMax film. To determine the minimal domain of the α subunit required for folding, we made plasmid constructs that were truncated at progressively longer distances from the N terminus (Fig. 1A). α207 and α211 were terminated just before M1, the first transmembrane domain, which extends from positions 212 to 241; α216 was terminated within M1; and αM1 was terminated at amino acid 241, thus including the entire first transmembrane domain. When each of the plasmids was introduced into COS cells by adenovirus-mediated transfection (36Forsayeth J.R. Garcia P.D. BioTechniques. 1994; 17: 354-358PubMed Google Scholar), polypeptides of the appropriate length were expressed as demonstrated by immunoblotting (Fig. 2). In each case, two major species were observed. The higher mobility protein had an apparent molecular mass that corresponds to the polypeptide after cleavage of the 20-amino acid signal sequence from the precursor. The protein band with lower mobility corresponded to the signal sequence-cleaved, glycosylated peptide because it was not made or was dramatically reduced when N-linked glycosylation was prevented by treating the cells with tunicamycin (Fig. 2) (38Chavez R.A. Hall Z.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 15532-15538Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 40Merlie J.P. Sebbane R. Tzartos S. Lindstrom J. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 2694-2701Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The proportion of the total peptide that was glycosylated in each case increased with chain length of the fragment. Only a small fraction of α207 or α211, the two shortest forms, was glycosylated, whereas virtually all of polypeptides αM1 and α, the two longest forms, was glycosylated. α216, a fragment with intermediate chain length, expressed approximately equal amounts of glycosylated and non-glycosylated species. The expressed fragments were then tested in two ways for their ability to bind α-BuTx. In the first, the transfected cells were permeabilized with saponin and incubated with 125I-α-BuTx (Fig. 3A). In the second, detergent extracts of the transfected cells were incubated with 125I-α-BuTx and immunoprecipitated with mAb 210 (34Ratnam M. Sargent P.B. Sarin V. Fox J.L. Nguyen D.L. River J. Criado M. Lindstrom J. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 2621-2632Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), a rat monoclonal antibody directed against an epitope between amino acid residues 46 and 127 of the α subunit (Fig. 3B). In both assays, all forms of the truncated subunits except α207 showed toxin binding activity. This activity decreased with increasing chain length of the α fragments. Thus, α216 and α211, which bear either a short portion of the transmembrane region or none at all, appear to fold more efficiently than αM1 and α. An exception was observed with α207, which exhibited no high affinity binding to α-BuTx. To identify whether glycosylated or non-glycosylated species folded to assume the toxin binding conformation, we precipitated detergent extracts of [35S]methionine-labeled cells with α-BuTx coupled to Sepharose beads. Analysis by SDS-PAGE showed that in each case only the glycosylated species was precipitated by toxin beads (Fig. 3C), consistent with the results of other experiments showing that glycosylation is necessary for efficient folding of the full-length α subunit to the toxin-binding form (37Blount P. Merlie J.P. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 2613-2622Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 40Merlie J.P. Sebbane R. Tzartos S. Lindstrom J. J. Biol.

Chem. 1996; 271: 25506-25514Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). In each case, the folded α subunit fragments constituted only a minor fraction (≤5%) of the total population of the glycosylated species immunoprecipitable by mAb 210. To determine if the folded subunit fragments were expressed on the cell surface, the intact transfected cells were incubated with 125I-α-BuTx. No surface binding of toxin was detected for any of the constructs (Fig. 4A). Previous studies also have shown that unassembled full-length AChR subunits are retained in the ER and that surface expression of the AChR in transfected cells requires the assembly of all four subunits into a pentamer (13Blount P. McHardy M.S. Merlie J.P. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 2601-2611Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 14Gu Y. Forsayeth J.R. Verrall S. Yu X.-M. Hall Z.W. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 114: 799-807Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 15Saedi M.S. Conroy W.G. Lindstrom J. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 112: 1007-1015Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). To ascertain whether any of the truncated α fragments can substitute for the full-length α subunit in the assembly of a pentameric receptor, COS cells were cotransfected with cDNAs for each of the α fragments along with full-length β, δ, and ϵ subunits. In all cases tested, surface toxin binding was not measurable, indicating that none of these α fragments is able to form a hetero-oligomeric AChR that is competent for surface transport and expression (Fig. 4A). Assay of the cell culture medium, however, showed that substantial amounts of α211, the fragment lacking a M1 domain, were secreted into the medium. In contrast, α207, truncated fragments with part or all of the M1 domain (α216 and αM1), and the full-length α subunit were not secreted (Fig. 4B). The profile for secretion of α211 was determined with a pulse-chase experiment in which transfected COS cells were metabolically labeled for 10 min with a mixture of [35S]methionine and [35S]cysteine. Following a 30-min chase, α211 was found in the medium by immunoprecipitation with mAb 210 (Fig. 5A). Densitometric analysis of the intensity of protein bands in the fluorography shows that 23% of all of the folded α subunit in the cells was secreted into the medium after chasing for 8 h (Fig. 5, compare C and D). The secreted molecule corresponds to the glycosylated form of α211 found in detergent cell extracts (Fig. 5, A and B; also see Fig. 2). A comparison of the amount of α211 in the medium detected by precipitation with mAb 210 (Fig. 5A) and with α-BuTx-Sepharose (Fig. 5C) showed that most or all of the secreted subunit was folded. The truncated fragments retained in the cell are presumably contained within the endoplasmic reticulum (8Smith M.M. Lindstrom J. Merlie J.P. J. Biol.

It is known that PLP and DM-20 are delivered to myelin by a finely regulated vesicular transport system in oligodendrocytes. Evolutionarily, it is believed that ancestral DM-20 acquired a PLP-specific exon to create PLP, after which PLP/DM-20 became a major component of central nervous system myelin. We purified PLP as an inositol 1,3,4,5-tetrakisphosphate-binding protein after solubilization in a non-organic solvent. However, under the isotonic condition, PLP binds inositol hexakisphosphate (InsP6) significantly, not inositol 1,3,4,5-tetrakisphosphate. Most of the InsP6-binding proteins are involved in vesicular transport, suggesting the involvement of PLP in vesicular transport. We separated DM-20 from PLP by CM-52 chromatography and showed that DM-20 has no InsP6 binding activity. These findings indicate that the PLP-specific domain confers the InsP6 binding activity and this interaction may be important for directing PLP transport to central nervous system myelin.

INTRODUCTIONEucaryotic cells are subdivided into membrane-bounded compartments. These functional organelles contain sets of proteins and other molecules specific to themselves. The intracellular vesicular transport system delivers specific proteins to their destination. A knowledge of this mechanism is essential for understanding how these compartments are created and maintained within eucaryotic cells.The oligodendrocyte provides both an opportunity and a challenge for studying the machinery of intracellular vesicular transport. Oligodendrocytes are glial cells in the central nervous system which synthesize unique functional component “myelin.” Myelin is composed of multilamellar stacks of plasma membrane surrounding individual axons and plays a significant role in supporting fast nerve conduction. To create and maintain this myelin, oligodendrocyte must deliver large amounts of proteins and lipids to this component via vesicular transport (1Pfeiffer S.E. Warrington A.E. Bansal R. Trends Cell Biol. 1993; 3: 191-197Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (723) Google Scholar).Generally, integral membrane proteins are co-translationally inserted into the rough endoplasmic reticulum membrane and then transported to the plasma membrane via the Golgi apparatus (2Sabatini D.D. Kreibich G. Morimoto T. Adesnik M. J. Cell. Biol. 1982; 92: 1-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar).

PLP mRNA is associated with polysomes on the rough endoplasmic reticulum (3Colman D.R. Kreibich G. Frey A.B. Sabatini D.D. J. Cell. Biol. 1982; 95: 598-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar) and an immunoreactive product has been detected in membranous structures, such as the Golgi apparatus, of oligodendrocytes in vivo (4Nussbaum J.L.

Neurocytol. 1987; 16: 195-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). As expected for a protein being processed through the vesicular transport pathway, a significant lag exists between translation of PLP on the rough endoplasmic reticulum and its insertion into the myelin membrane (3Colman D.R. Kreibich G. Frey A.B. Sabatini D.D. J. Cell. Biol. 1982; 95: 598-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar, 7Benjamins J.A. Iwata R. Hazlett J. J.

Myelin: Biology and Chemistry. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1992: 677-702Google Scholar), at least in part caused by an impaired protein transport system. In one of the PLP mutants, the jimpy mouse, for example, the mutated PLP protein accumulates in the rough endoplasmic reticulum and very little PLP is found in myelin (6Roussel G. Neskovic N.M. Trifilieff E. Artault J.C. Nussbaum J.L. J. Neurocytol. 1987; 16: 195-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). In oligodendrocytes of the transgenic mouse overexpressing the wild type PLP gene there is a swelling in the Golgi apparatus and PLP is rarely found in myelin (9Kagawa T. Ikenaka K. Inoue Y.

Therefore, it is very important to study the regulation of the PLP transport system in order to understand the efficient vesicle transport system of oligodendrocyte.PLP is a highly conserved protein. In mammals, the amino acid sequences of PLP of bovine, rat, mouse, and human are 99% identical, suggesting that PLP has indispensable functions (11Lees M.B.L. Bizzozero O.A. Martenson R.E. Myelin: Biology and Chemistry. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1992: 237-255Google Scholar). DM-20 is a less abundant proteolipid of mammalian central nervous system myelin, the mRNA of which is produced by alternative splicing of the PLP-mRNA precursor (12Nave K.A. Lai C. Bloom F.E.

Neuron. 1993; 11: 433-448Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). It is important to ascertain the function conferred upon DM-20 by the addition of this PLP-specific domain.InsP6 is found at concentrations from 10 to 100 µM in many kinds of cells (15Menniti F.S. Oliver K.G. Putney J.W.J. Shears S.B. Biochem. Sci. 1993; 18: 53-56Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 16Sasakawa N. Sharif M. Hanley M.R. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1995; 50: 137-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Although, the function of InsP6 has not yet been clarified, several recent findings have suggested a physiological role for InsP6. Several proteins involved in intracellular vesicular transport have been identified as InsP6-binding proteins. A clathrin assembly protein, AP-2 (17Theibert A.B. Estevez V.A. Ferris C.D. Danoff S.K.

Coatomer, a cytosolic protein complex containing subunits of non-clathrin-coated Golgi intercisternal transport vesicles, also binds InsP6 (25Fleischer B. Xie J. Mayrleitner M. Shears S.B. Palmer D.J. Fleischer S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17826-17832Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These findings indicate that InsP6 is closely related to vesicular transport.In this study, we have purified PLP using a non-organic solvent and showed that PLP is an InsP6-binding protein, while DM-20 is not. Apparently, DM-20 acquired InsP6 binding activity by gaining a PLP-specific domain and thereafter became the major central nervous system myelin component PLP with InsP6 binding activity. Thus, this binding property of PLP may play a crucial role in targeting vesicles containing PLP to central nervous system myelin.RESULTSDuring the sequential purification process of the receptor protein for InsP3 (IP3R) from mouse cerebella (27Maeda N. Niinobe M. Mikoshiba K. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 61-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar), we noticed that some fractions contained [3H]InsP4 binding activity, which indicated the existence of InsP4-binding proteins. We have already purified and identified two InsP4- binding proteins (IP4BPs). One is IP4BP1/synaptotagmin II (30Niinobe M. Yamaguchi Y. Fukuda M. Mikoshiba K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 205: 1036-1042Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) and the other is IP4BP2a/aldolase A. 2Y. Yamaguchi, M. Niinobe, and K. Mikoshiba, unpublished result. We purified and identified another IP4BP (IP4BP2b). The sequential purification procedure is depicted as a flow chart (Fig. 1).Purification of IP4BP2bIP4BP1/synaptotagmin II and the other concomitant proteins (IP3R and phosphatases) were separated from IP4BP2 (a and b) by the first anion-exchange chromatography on DE-52. Since the volume of the DE-52 flow-through fraction was large, InsP4 binding activity was concentrated by heparin-agarose chromatography. At the heparin-agarose chromatography step, the detergent in the sample and purification buffers was changed from Triton X-100 to CHAPS because Triton X-100 inhibited the InsP4 binding activity of IP4BP2b more than CHAPS and because the concomitant proteins had been effectively separated from IP4BP2b.IP4BP2a/aldolase A was separated from IP4BP2b by washing the heparin-agarose with 0.25 M NaCl (Fig. 2A). The IP4BP2b was eluted with a 0.25-1.0 M NaCl linear gradient. The InsP4 binding activity of this fraction seemed to be expressed by only IP4BP2b. After dilution to lower the NaCl concentration and pH, the InsP4 binding activity was concentrated and enriched by cation-exchange chromatography on CM-52 (Fig. 2B). The final step was Sephacryl S-300 gel filtration (Fig. 2C). Since the solubilizing detergent had been changed and the InsP4 binding assay modified (described below), the purification process cannot be summarized in a figure. Approximately 0.5 mg of IP4BP2b was obtained from 40 g of mouse cerebella.Fig. 2Purification of IP4BP2b/PLP. The DE-52 flow-through fraction was applied to a heparin-agarose column (A). Fractions containing InsP4 binding activity (⇆ in A) eluted with a linear 0.25-1.0 M NaCl gradient were diluted with Buffer 3 (see “Experimental Procedures”) and applied to a column on CM-52. The proteins were then eluted with a linear 0.05-0.5 M NaCl gradient (B). The fractions collected (⇆ in B) were concentrated and applied to a gel filtration column on Sephacryl S-300 (C). Aliquots of each fraction were assayed for protein concentration (•- - -•) and for InsP4 binding activity (•−•). The NaCl concentration was indicated by the solid line.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The protein profile of each purification step was characterized by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 3A). Particular attention was given to not boiling the sample mixtures in SDS solution, but rather allowing them stand at room temperature. Since the IP4BP2b appeared to be extremely hydrophobic, IP4BP2b protein aggregated and did not enter the separation gel after boiling (data not shown).Fig. 3SDS-PAGE analysis after each purification step of IP4BP2b (A) and of the fractions obtained from gel filtration column chromatography of IP4BP2b on Sephacryl S-300 (B).

After the final step on Sephacryl S-300, a single protein band with a molecular weight of 26,000 was detected (Fig. 3A, lane 4). While the molecular weight of IP4BP2b was 26,000 on SDS-PAGE, the apparent molecular weight was estimated to be 440,000-669,000 by gel filtration chromatography (Sephacryl S-300) (Fig. 3B). Consequently, IP4BP2b was expected to be a homomultimer or to aggregate. The pattern of InsP4 binding activity and that of the intensities of Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250 staining of this 26,000 protein differed slightly (Fig. 2C and Fig. 3B). The results below describe the binding activity resides in this 26,000 protein.Identification of IP4BP2b as PLP by NH2-terminal Sequencing Analysis and Immunochemical AnalysisThe NH2-terminal sequence of purified IP4BP2b after Sephacryl S-300 gel filtration chromatography was determined with a gas-phase protein sequencer. The NH2-terminal sequence of IP4BP2b was checked against the SWISS-PROT data base. All 10 amino acid residues identified out of 14 NH2-terminal amino acid residues of IP4BP2b were identical with mouse myelin proteolipid protein (PLP) (Table I). With the sequencing method used, cysteine (C) and arginine (R) are undetectable.Table IComparison of NH2-terminal amino acid sequences from IP4BP2b and mouse PLP/DM-20Mouse1 10PLP/DM20GLLECCARC LVGAPFA||||||||||IP4BP2bGLLE??A?? LVGAP Open table in a new tab Purified IP4BP2b after Sephacryl S-300 gel filtration chromatography and purified myelin sample as a positive control were applied to SDS-PAGE, and the proteins were electrotransferred to nitrocellulose membranes. The membranes were either stained with Amido Black (Fig. 4, lanes 1 and 4) or analyzed immunochemically using monoclonal antibodies against PLP (epitope: amino acid residues number 209-217 (AH7-2a) or 264-276 (AA3)). Fig. 4 (lanes 2 and 3) shows that monoclonal antibodies against PLP recognized the 26,000 molecules. However, these monoclonal antibodies have also been shown to recognize DM-20 (26Yamamura T. Konola J.T. Wekerle H. Lees M.B. J. Neurochem. 1991; 57: 1671-1680Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar), an alternative splicing variant of PLP. Immunoblot analysis of the purified myelin containing both PLP and DM-20 revealed that the 26,000 band comigrated with the band corresponding to PLP (Fig. 4). These observations suggested that IP4BP2b (26,000 band) is PLP.Fig. 4Immunoblot analysis of IP4BP2b/PLP in purified preparation and in myelin fraction. Purified IP4BP2b samples (3.4 µg (lane 1) and 0.34 µg (lanes 2 and 3)) and myelin samples (2.1 µg (lane 4) and 0.42 µg (lane 5)) were applied to SDS-PAGE on a 15% Laemmli gel. Proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, and the blots were stained with Amido Black (lanes 1 and 4) and probed with monoclonal antibody against PLP, AA3 (lanes 2 and 5), or AH7-2a (lane 3). Peroxidase-coupled detection was performed by the diaminobenzidine staining method by using a Vectastain ABC kit. Molecular weight markers used were 10-kDa Protein Ladder (Life Technologies, Inc.). Sizes of markers are shown at the left. The band indicated by the arrow seems to be aggregates of two PLP molecules.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To further confirm that IP4BP2b is PLP, we determined whether the InsP4 binding activity of IP4BP2b could be immunoabsorbed by anti-PLP antibody. The purified sample obtained by Sephacryl S-300 gel filtration chromatography was incubated with Protein G-Sepharose resin coupled with AA3-IgG or normal rat IgG, or non-coupled. The resins were poured into columns and washed with washing solution (100 µl × 4). The nonadherent fractions were collected, and assayed for their [3H]InsP4 binding activity and analyzed on SDS-PAGE with silver staining (Fig. 5, A and B). The InsP4 binding activity and 26,000 protein bands were immunoabsorbed by AA3-Protein G-Sepharose (Fig. 5, A and B; +AA3, Fraction No. 2), but not by non-coupled Protein G-Sepharose or normal rat IgG-Protein G-Sepharose (Fig. 5, A and B, −IgG and +Rat IgG; Fraction No. 2). These results together with the NH2-terminal sequences indicate that the purified IP4BP2b is in fact mouse PLP.Fig. 5Immunoabsorption of InsP4 binding activity in purified IP4BP2b fraction by anti-PLP antibody. Purified IP4BP2b fractions were incubated with Protein G-Sepharose resins coupled with AA3-IgG or normal rat IgG, or non-coupled. The resins were poured into columns and washed with washing solution (100 µl × 4). Nonadherent fractions were collected (fraction No. 1-4), assayed for InsP4 binding activity (A) and analyzed by SDS-PAGE (B). InsP4 binding activity (1 µl each) was determined using 4.8 nM [3H]InsP4 in 20 mM HEPES-KOH (pH 7.2) buffer. Nonspecific binding was determined by removing the sample. Samples were incubated for 10 min at 0°C and binding activity was measured by the polyethylene glycol precipitation method described under “Experimental Procedures.” Each column represents the mean from three experiments. SDS-PAGE was carried out on a 15% gel using the buffer system of Laemmli. The gel was visualized by silver staining. Molecular weight markers with corresponding Mr values are shown at the left as described in the legend to Fig. 3.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Characterization of the Inositol Polyphosphate (InsPX)-Binding Activity of PLPAnalysis of the InsP4 binding described thus far was performed under the hypotonic conditions. To investigate its physiological significance, we measured InsP3, InsP4, and InsP6 binding activities of purified IP4BP2b (PLP) in an isotonic buffer containing 0.15 M KCl, 20 mM HEPES-KOH, at pH 7.2. Binding activity was detectable only against InsP6 (data not shown).These findings suggested that InsP6 is the true ligand for PLP. Therefore, the Kd and Bmax under isotonic conditions were determined for [3H]InsP6 binding. Since the purified PLP (Sephacryl S-300 fraction) was unstable and occasionally showed two types of binding sites (high and low affinity) (data not shown), we determined the Kd and Bmax of heparin-agarose fraction, which showed only one type (high affinity) of binding site and in which most, if not all, InsP6 binding activity is attributable to PLP. Scatchard analysis of InsP6 binding to the heparin-agarose fraction showed that the Kd was 52 nM, the Bmax 6.5 pmol/µg of protein (Fig. 6). This value of Kd was nearly the same as that of high affinity binding site of the purified PLP.Fig. 6Saturation analysis of [3H]InsP6 binding to IP4BP2b/PLP. Binding assay mixtures contained 0.17 µg of the IP4BP2b/PLP (heparin-agarose fraction), 2.4 nM [3H]InsP6, various concentrations of cold InsP6, and 40 µg of γ-globulin in 20 mM HEPES-KOH, pH 7.2 (100 µl). Samples were incubated for 10 min at 0°C and binding activity was measured by the polyethylene glycol precipitation method described under “Experimental Procedures.” The inset shows the result of Scatchard analysis. The estimated values were: Kd = 52 nM, Bmax = 6.5 pmol/µg. Each point represents the mean from duplicate experiments.

We used the purified PLP in this experiment to rule out the presence of other InsPX-binding proteins (Table II). While InsP6 suppressed [3H]InsP6 binding, Ins-1,4,5-P3, Ins-1,3,4,5-P4, and Ins-1,3,4,5,6-P5 displayed much lower affinity. PP-InsP5 displaced [3H]InsP6 binding with higher potency than InsP6.

However, it is not unknown whether DM-20 has this activity. During purification of IP4BP2b/PLP, DM-20 separated from PLP at the heparin-agarose step. DM-20 was recovered from the heparin-agarose flow-through fraction, although we could not use this fraction to study the InsP6 binding activity of DM-20 because it also contained PLP as revealed by immunoblot analysis (data not shown). To separate DM-20 from PLP, we devised several modifications of the purification method.First, we changed the pH of the DE-52 flow-through fraction from 8.0 into 5.0, by dilution with acetate buffer to achieve pH 5.0. The DE-52 flow-through fraction used was the same as that of the IP4BP2b/PLP purification procedure. DM-20 separated from PLP and was recovered from the flow-through fraction after CM-52 chromatography at pH 5.0. The adsorbed fraction did not contain DM-20. Because both PLP and DM-20 are extremely hydrophobic and the InsP6 binding activity of PLP was apparently stable in the solution containing 1% Triton X-100, we performed the CM-52 chromatography with this solution. PLP separated from the other concomitant proteins (including IP4BP2a/aldolase A) by elution with a 0.05-0.5 M NaCl gradient. Both the CM-52 flow-through fraction containing DM-20 and the CM-52 adsorbed fraction containing PLP were concentrated by heparin-agarose chromatography and the buffer detergent was changed from Triton X-100 to CHAPS because the InsP6 binding activity was inhibited more by Triton X-100 than by CHAPS. After these steps, we obtained fractions containing either PLP or DM-20. PLP or DM-20 was the major protein in PLP- or DM-20-containing fractions, respectively (Fig. 7A). Importantly, as shown by immunoblot analysis (Fig. 7B), PLP-containing fraction did not contain a detectable amount of DM-20 and either DM-20-containing fraction did not contain detectable amounts of PLP.Fig. 7SDS-PAGE (A), immunoblot (B), and InsP6 binding (C) analyses of isolated PLP and DM-20. SDS-PAGE was carried out on a 15% gel using the buffer system of Laemmli. The gel was visualized by silver staining (A). The procedure of immunoblot analysis by using the monoclonal antibody AA3 (B) was the same as described in the legend to Fig. 4.

Samples were incubated for 10 min at 0°C and binding activity was measured by the polyethylene glycol precipitation method described under “Experimental Procedures.” Each column represents the mean from triplicate experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Comparison of InsP6 Binding Activity of PLP and DM-20We measured the InsP6 binding activity of PLP-containing and DM-20-containing fractions at equal volumes. Since CHAPS also inhibited the InsP6 binding activity, although to a lesser extent than Triton X-100, we had to make the same dilution of the samples. The concentration of DM-20 was similar or slightly higher than that of PLP as shown semiquantitatively by immunoblot analysis (Fig. 7B). However, the InsP6 binding activity of the DM-20-containing fraction was not detectable and only the PLP-containing fraction showed InsP6 binding activity (Fig. 7C). INTRODUCTIONEucaryotic cells are subdivided into membrane-bounded compartments. These functional organelles contain sets of proteins and other molecules specific to themselves. The intracellular vesicular transport system delivers specific proteins to their destination. A knowledge of this mechanism is essential for understanding how these compartments are created and maintained within eucaryotic cells.The oligodendrocyte provides both an opportunity and a challenge for studying the machinery of intracellular vesicular transport. Oligodendrocytes are glial cells in the central nervous system which synthesize unique functional component “myelin.” Myelin is composed of multilamellar stacks of plasma membrane surrounding individual axons and plays a significant role in supporting fast nerve conduction. To create and maintain this myelin, oligodendrocyte must deliver large amounts of proteins and lipids to this component via vesicular transport (1Pfeiffer S.E. Warrington A.E. Bansal R. Trends Cell Biol. 1993; 3: 191-197Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (723) Google Scholar).Generally, integral membrane proteins are co-translationally inserted into the rough endoplasmic reticulum membrane and then transported to the plasma membrane via the Golgi apparatus (2Sabatini D.D. Kreibich G. Morimoto T. Adesnik M. J. Cell. Biol. 1982; 92: 1-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar).

https://openalex.org/W2093001635,"The ability of Bcl-2 to inhibit cell death is well documented but its mechanism of action remains elusive. Recent reports have suggested that Bcl-2 prevents apoptosis by inhibiting the release of Ca2+ from the thapsigargin-sensitive Ca2+ store. The mobilization of Ca2+ from this store has been implicated as a signal regulating apoptotic cell death induced by glucocorticoids and by interleukin-3 withdrawal. The present study was designed to determine if Bcl-2 would still inhibit apoptosis after depletion of intracellular Ca2+ stores. We compared the response of two Chinese hamster ovary cell lines (5AHSmyc and 5A300bcl-2.2) following incubation with the calcium ionophore ionomycin to deplete intracellular Ca2+ stores. Continued incubation of 5AHSmyc cells in calcium-free media induced substantial apoptotic DNA fragmentation within 4 h and >95% loss of viability within 48 h. However, 5A300bcl-2.2 cells showed no evidence of DNA fragmentation or loss of viability over the same time period. Intracellular Ca2+ was analyzed with the Ca2+-sensitive fluorescent dye INDO-1 and confirmed that ionomycin was capable of releasing Ca2+ from intracellular stores in both cell lines. These results show that depletion of intracellular Ca2+ stores induces apoptosis and that these Ca2+ stores are not required for the protection afforded by Bcl-2.

INTRODUCTIONApoptotic cell death is characterized morphologically by cell shrinkage, cytoplasmic vacuolization, and nuclear chromatin condensation (1Kerr J.F.R. Wyllie A.H. Currie A.R. Br. J. Cancer. 1972; 26: 239-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (12725) Google Scholar, 2Wyllie A.H. Kerr J.F.R. Currie A.R. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1980; 68: 251-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (6697) Google Scholar). During apoptosis, specific proteolytic and nucleolytic activities occur prior to loss of membrane integrity (3Wyllie A.H. Nature. 1980; 284: 555-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (4138) Google Scholar, 4Eastman A. Barry M.A. Cancer Invest. 1992; 10: 229-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar, 5Martin S.J. Green D.R. Cell. 1995; 82: 348-352Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (1258) Google Scholar). Disruption of the signals that normally regulate apoptosis contributes to the pathogenesis of many human diseases (6Thompson C.B. Science. 1995; 267: 1456-1462Crossref PubMed Scopus (6173) Google Scholar). Despite the significance of apoptosis, its regulation remains poorly understood. Apoptosis is initiated by many insults which activate multiple pathways that converge on a common final pathway, sometimes called the execution phase (7Eastman A. Toxicol. Applied Pharmacol. 1993; 121: 160-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 8Earnshaw W.C. Trends Cell Biol. 1995; 5: 217-220Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Bcl-2 inhibits apoptosis induced by multiple insults suggesting that it acts at, or close to the execution phase. A family of Bcl-2-related proteins has been identified; these proteins form homodimers or heterodimers, and the consequence can be either protection or enhanced apoptosis (9Oltvai Z.N. Korsmeyer S.J. Cell. 1994; 79: 189-192Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (773) Google Scholar, 10Sedlak T.W. Oltvai Z.N. Yang E. Wang K. Boise L.H. Korsmeyer S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7834-7838Crossref PubMed Scopus (782) Google Scholar).The mechanism of action of the Bcl-2 family of proteins remains elusive. It has been suggested that Bcl-2 inhibits apoptosis by acting as an antioxidant (11Hockenbery D.M. Oltvai Z.N. Yin X.-M. Milliman C.L. Korsmeyer S.J. Cell. 1993; 75: 241-251Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3281) Google Scholar, 12Kane D.J. Sarafian T.A. Anton R. Hahn H. Gralla E.B. Valentine J.S. Ord T. Bredesen D.E. Science. 1993; 262: 1274-1277Crossref PubMed Scopus (1613) Google Scholar). However, recent reports have demonstrated that Bcl-2 inhibits apoptosis when oxygen is dramatically reduced, and from insults that are not responsive to other antioxidants (13Muschel R.J. Bernhard E.J. Garza L. McKenna W.G. Koch C.J. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 995-998PubMed Google Scholar, 14Shimizu S. Eguchi Y. Kosaka H. Kamiike W. Matsuda H. Tsujimoto Y.

Hence, Bcl-2 action is far broader than just an antioxidant.A commonly implicated signal in the execution phase of apoptosis and a potential site for Bcl-2 action is the regulation of intracellular calcium levels. Many reports have suggested that elevations in intracellular free calcium correlate with apoptosis (16McConkey D.J. Hartzell P. Duddy S.K. Hakansson H. Orrenius S. Science. 1988; 242: 256-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar, 17Jones D.P. McConkey D.J. Nicotera P. Orrenius S. J. Biol.

In contrast, previous work in our laboratory has suggested that increased intracellular free Ca2+ does not correlate with apoptosis (19Barry M.A. Reynolds J.E. Eastman A. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 2349-2357PubMed Google Scholar, 20Li J. Eastman A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3203-3211Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar, 21Reynolds J.E. Li J.

Acta. 1994; 1223: 247-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Furthermore, we have shown that Bcl-2 protects cells from staurosporine-induced apoptosis, yet does not suppress the staurosporine-induced increase in intracellular free Ca2+ (21Reynolds J.E. Li J. Craig R.W. Eastman A. Exp. Cell Res. 1996; 225: 430-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). However, these reports have not ruled out the possibility that mobilization of intracellular Ca2+ stores may be a key regulator of apoptosis, nor do they exclude the possibility that regulation of intracellular Ca2+ stores may be a target of Bcl-2 function. The thapsigargin-sensitive Ca2+ store has been implicated in regulating apoptosis (23Baffy G. Miyashita T. Williamson J.R. Reed J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 6511-6519Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24Lam M. Dubyak G. Distelhorst C.W. Mol. Endocr. 1993; 7: 686-693Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). Thapsigargin is a selective inhibitor of the endoplasmic reticulum-associated Ca2+-ATPase which pumps Ca2+ against a concentration gradient into the endoplasmic reticulum. Inhibition of this pump by thapsigargin induces a transient increase in cytoplasmic free Ca2+ as it leaves the endoplasmic reticulum down its concentration gradient. The mobilization of Ca2+ during apoptosis is suggested by the observation that cells induced to undergo apoptosis by incubation with glucocorticoids, hydrogen peroxide, or by withdrawal of interleukin-3, have reduced levels of Ca2+ in their thapsigargin-sensitive Ca2+ stores (23Baffy G. Miyashita T. Williamson J.R. Reed J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 6511-6519Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24Lam M. Dubyak G. Distelhorst C.W. Mol. Endocr. 1993; 7: 686-693Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar, 25Distelhorst C.W. Lam M. McCormick T.S. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 2051-2055PubMed Google Scholar). It has also been shown that Bcl-2 prevents this loss of Ca2+ from these stores and blocks thapsigargin-induced apoptosis (23Baffy G. Miyashita T. Williamson J.R. Reed J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 6511-6519Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 25Distelhorst C.W. Lam M. McCormick T.S. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 2051-2055PubMed Google Scholar, 26Lam M. Dubyak G. Chen L. Nunez G. Miesfeld R.L. Distelhorst C.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 6569-6573Crossref PubMed Scopus (609) Google Scholar). This has led to the hypothesis that Bcl-2 prevents apoptosis by regulating the homeostasis of intracellular calcium.In the present study, we examined the ability of Bcl-2 to inhibit apoptosis following depletion of intracellular calcium stores using the calcium ionophore, ionomycin. We show that treatment of Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) 1The abbreviations used are: CHOChinese hamster ovaryAMacetoxymethyl esterBSAbovine serum albuminMEMminimal essential medium. cells with ionomycin effectively depleted the thapsigargin-sensitive calcium store. This emptying of intracellular calcium stores also induced apoptosis. Overexpression of Bcl-2 inhibited this apoptosis without affecting the ability of either thapsigargin or ionomycin to mobilize stored calcium. These results demonstrate that, while depletion of intracellular calcium stores may occur during apoptosis, the ability of Bcl-2 to inhibit apoptosis is independent of intracellular calcium.RESULTSAnalysis of Intracellular Ca2+ Stores in CHO CellsThe calcium ionophore, ionomycin, has been shown to release Ca2+ from the thapsigargin-sensitive intracellular stores in thymic lymphocytes and mouse lymphoma cells (24Lam M. Dubyak G. Distelhorst C.W. Mol. Endocr. 1993; 7: 686-693Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar, 33Mason M.J. Grinstein S. Biochem. J. 1993; 296: 33-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). However, its ability to deplete the thapsigargin-sensitive Ca2+ stores in CHO cells has not been studied. Therefore, ionomycin (10 µM) and thapsigargin (150 nM) were added sequentially to 5AHSmyc and 5A300bcl-2.2 cells and the resulting change in intracellular Ca2+ monitored using a laser confocal imaging system with the Ca2+-sensitive fluorescent probe INDO-1; the ratio of emission intensities at 405 and 480 nm are proportional to intracellular Ca2+. Upon addition of thapsigargin to 5AHSmyc cells, there was a rise in intracellular free Ca2+ that peaked after 2 min and declined to baseline again by 5 min (Fig. 1A). Subsequent incubation with ionomycin caused only a small transient increase in intracellular free Ca2+, probably from mitochondrial stores that are also known to be depleted by ionomycin (34St. Bird G.J. Obie J.F. Putney Jr., J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 18382-18386Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Hence, the bulk of the intracellular Ca2+ stores were sensitive to thapsigargin. When the order of addition was reversed, ionomycin caused a much more rapid increase in intracellular free Ca2+ that declined to baseline within 2 min (Fig. 1B). This rapid recovery observed with ionomycin treatment is explained by the additional permeation of the cytoplasmic membrane which facilitates rapid exit of the released Ca2+. When thapsigargin was added after ionomycin, no additional release of Ca2+ was observed demonstrating that ionomycin effectively depleted the thapsigargin-sensitive store.When the 5A300bcl-2.2 cells were incubated with thapsigargin or ionomycin, similar results were obtained as in the 5AHSmyc cells, although the magnitude of Ca2+ release was slightly higher in each case (Fig. 1, C and D). As observed in the 5AHSmyc cells, pretreatment of Bcl-2-expressing cells with ionomycin abolished the thapsigargin-induced increase in intracellular free Ca2+. Furthermore, incubation of these cells with ionomycin following thapsigargin also showed the expected depletion of mitochondrial Ca2+ stores. These results confirm that ionomycin can be used to deplete both mitochondrial and endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ stores in CHO cells, and thereby defines a model in which we can examine the effect of completely depleting intracellular Ca2+, both free and stored, on the ability of Bcl-2 to inhibit apoptosis.DNA DigestionHaving shown that ionomycin can be used to deplete the intracellular Ca2+ stores in CHO cells, we next determined the effect of depleted Ca2+ on the induction of apoptosis. One feature commonly associated with apoptosis is the digestion of genomic DNA into oligonucleosome-sized fragments. Following depletion of intracellular Ca2+, cells were incubated in Ca2+-free medium for up to 6 h and DNA integrity was assessed (Fig. 2A). In 5AHSmyc cells, DNA fragmentation was clearly visible by 3 h, and maximum by 4 h. This DNA fragmentation was dependent upon depleting intracellular Ca2+ stores, as incubation for the same time period in Ca2+-free medium but without prior Ca2+ depletion did not result in DNA fragmentation (data not shown). In contrast, depletion of intracellular Ca2+ in 5A300bcl-2.2 cells showed no DNA fragmentation during the 6-h time course. These results demonstrate that depletion of intracellular Ca2+ is sufficient to induce apoptosis in CHO cells and that Bcl-2 can prevent DNA digestion even after these stores have been depleted.Fig. 2DNA digestion in CHO cells following depletion of Ca2+. A, 5AHSmyc and 5A300bcl-2.2 cells were incubated for 30 min with ionomycin (10 µM) and EGTA (500 µM) in S-MEM, then incubated for 1-6 h in S-MEM supplemented with 0.1% BSA. Cells were harvested and DNA integrity was analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis. U represents cells which have not undergone the calcium depletion protocol but were maintained in S-MEM throughout the experiment. B, cells were depleted of intracellular Ca2+ then incubated for 0-6 h in S-MEM. α-MEM was added at either 0 or 3 h following depletion of Ca2+ and the cells incubated for a total of 6 h prior to analysis of DNA digestion.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Following depletion of intracellular Ca2+, the cells were incubated in Ca2+-free medium to prevent refilling of the stores after removal of ionomycin. When the cells were returned to Ca2+-containing α-MEM immediately after the depletion protocol, DNA digestion was prevented (Fig. 2B). Readdition of Ca2+ after 3 h in Ca2+-free medium also prevented any further DNA digestion. These results suggest that the continued incubation in Ca2+-free media is required to induce DNA digestion, presumably by preventing the reuptake of Ca2+.Long-term Protection by Bcl-2To determine if the ability of Bcl-2 to prevent DNA digestion at 6 h would translate into long term protection of the cells, we measured trypan blue exclusion for 48 h following depletion of intracellular Ca2+ (Fig. 3). The 5AHSmyc cells retained membrane integrity at 6 h even though their DNA was extensively fragmented; this is consistent with the definition of apoptosis in that DNA digestion occurs before loss of membrane integrity. However, by 12 h about 15% of the cells had lost membrane integrity, and continued incubation in Ca2+-free medium resulted in dramatic loss of membrane integrity with less than 10% of the cells viable by 48 h. For comparison, 5AHSmyc cells were incubated in Ca2+ free-medium for up to 48 h but without the initial Ca2+ depletion. Under these circumstances, the cells did not begin to lose membrane integrity until 24 h, but by 48 h they also showed less than 10% viability. In each of these conditions, the medium contained 0.1% BSA, but lacked serum to avoid any potential contribution from serum Ca2+. To assess the effect of serum withdrawal on viability, 5AHSmyc cells were incubated in Ca2+-containing medium. This condition also resulted in loss of membrane integrity by 24 h, although about 50% remained viable by 48 h. These results show that loss of cell viability over short time periods resulted from Ca2+ depletion, but at longer time periods, loss of survival factors in serum also contributed significantly to cell death.Fig. 3Long-term cell survival assessed by trypan blue exclusion. 5AHSmyc (A) and 5A300bcl-2.2 (B) cells were incubated in serum-free medium in the presence (circles) or absence (diamonds) of extracellular Ca2+. In addition, one set of cells was depleted of intracellular Ca2+ stores as described under “Experimental Procedures” followed by incubation in Ca2+-free medium (squares). The results are presented as percent of cells excluding trypan blue and represent the mean (±S.D.) of at least four independent experiments. *, at 12 h, Ca2+-depleted cells show significantly more toxicity than those in either Ca2+-free conditions (p < 0.008) or Ca2+-containing conditions (p < 0.001). **, at 48 h, cells grown in Ca2+ are significantly more viable than either Ca2+-free condition (p < 0.02).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The 5A300bcl-2.2 cells were incubated under identical conditions as the 5AHSmyc cells. The cells remained >90% viable for at least 48 h under all three incubation conditions; that is, Bcl-2 protected the cells from Ca2+ depletion and subsequent growth in the absence of Ca2+ and serum. Hence, these results show that Ca2+ is not required for Bcl-2 to provide long-term protection.DISCUSSIONThe work presented here provides evidence that depletion of intracellular Ca2+ stores induces apoptosis in CHO cells. This is in agreement with previously published work showing that thapsigargin induces apoptosis in a variety of cell types (26Lam M. Dubyak G. Chen L. Nunez G. Miesfeld R.L. Distelhorst C.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 6569-6573Crossref PubMed Scopus (609) Google Scholar, 35Kaneko Y. Tsulamato A. Cancer Lett. 1994; 97: 147-155Crossref Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 36Jiang S. Chow S.C. Nicotera P. Orrenius S. Exp. Cell Res. 1994; 212: 84-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). However, the previous work was performed in the presence of extracellular Ca2+, hence apoptosis could have been induced by the resulting influx of Ca2+. In the present study, no influx of Ca2+ could occur, so it must be the absence of Ca2+ that is responsible for inducing apoptosis. A similar conclusion can be drawn from the observation that calcium chelators can induce apoptosis (22Kluck R.M. McDougall C.A. Harmon B.V. Halliday J.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1223: 247-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). A decrease in intracellular Ca2+ has also been suggested as a cause of apoptosis following growth factor withdrawal, while incubation with ionomycin prevented this Ca2+ decrease and protected the cells (37Rodriguez-Tarduchy G. Collins M. Lopez-Rivas A. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 2997-3002Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). On the other hand, increases in Ca2+ have frequently been associated with apoptosis, and in some circumstances, it has been possible to protect cells by preventing this increase (38McConkey D.J. Nicotera P. Hartzell P. Bellomo G. Wyllie A.H. Orrenius S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1989; 269: 365-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (522) Google Scholar, 39McConkey D.J. Chow S.C. Orrenius S. Jondal M. FASEB J. 1990; 4: 2661-2664Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). In some instances, preventing the increase in intracellular free Ca2+ does not protect cells (20Li J. Eastman A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3203-3211Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar), while there are other cases in which no increase in intracellular free Ca2+ was observed (19Barry M.A. Reynolds J.E. Eastman A. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 2349-2357PubMed Google Scholar). Much of the interest in intracellular Ca2+ has arisen from the suggestion that DNA is degraded by a Ca2+/Mg2+-dependent endonuclease (16McConkey D.J. Hartzell P. Duddy S.K. Hakansson H. Orrenius S. Science. 1988; 242: 256-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar, 40Nikonova L.V. Nelipovich P.A. Umansky S.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1982; 699: 281-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 41Cohen J.J. Duke R.C. J. Immunol. 1984; 132: 38-42PubMed Google Scholar). However, the fact that DNA digestion does not correlate with the intracellular Ca2+ level, and that DNA digestion occurs in the complete absence of intracellular Ca2+ seriously questions the role of such an endonuclease in apoptosis. Furthermore, recent experiments that reconstitute apoptosis in vitro have found that Ca2+ is not required for DNA digestion (42Lazebnik Y.A. Cole S. Cooke C.A. Nelson W.G. Earnshaw W.C. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 7-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar, 43Newmeyer D.D. Farschon D.M. Reed J.C. Cell. 1994; 79: 353-364Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (489) Google Scholar). It is possible that other endonucleases are involved under different circumstances. However, even former proponents of the Ca2+-dependent endonuclease have now suggested that Ca2+ may only be involved in the induction phase of some apoptotic signaling pathways, and may not act as a direct mediator of DNA digestion or at any other step in the execution phase (44Zhivotovsky B. Nicotera P. Bellomo G. Hanson K. Orrenius S. Exp. Cell Res. 1993; 207: 163-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar).Although increases in intracellular free Ca2+ are not required for apoptosis, changes in Ca2+ compartmentalization could still be important. This possibility led to investigation of the ability of Bcl-2 to regulate intracellular Ca2+ stores. Specifically, thapsigargin-induced apoptosis can be inhibited by Bcl-2, and it was suggested that this is due to inhibition of capacitative Ca2+ entry at the cytoplasmic membrane (26Lam M. Dubyak G. Chen L. Nunez G. Miesfeld R.L. Distelhorst C.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 6569-6573Crossref PubMed Scopus (609) Google Scholar). It has also been reported that Bcl-2 prevents depletion of thapsigargin-sensitive Ca2+ stores during apoptosis (23Baffy G. Miyashita T. Williamson J.R. Reed J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 6511-6519Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Those results suggested that Bcl-2 regulates apoptosis by regulating intracellular Ca2+ stores. To directly test this hypothesis, we decided to deplete intracellular Ca2+ stores and assess whether Bcl-2 would no longer be able to protect cells. The experimental protocol required that intracellular free Ca2+ also be depleted to ensure that the Ca2+ stores were not refilled. Hence, these experiments effectively questioned whether Bcl-2 could still protect cells in the absence of both free and stored Ca2+.Initially, we confirmed that ionomycin depleted the thapsigargin-sensitive Ca2+ store in CHO cells as has been established for other cells (24Lam M. Dubyak G. Distelhorst C.W. Mol. Endocr. 1993; 7: 686-693Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar, 33Mason M.J. Grinstein S. Biochem. J. 1993; 296: 33-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Additionally, we confirmed that Bcl-2 did not block the ability of either thapsigargin or ionomycin to deplete intracellular Ca2+ stores. Since ionomycin has been reported to deplete both endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondrial Ca2+ (34St. Bird G.J. Obie J.F. Putney Jr., J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 18382-18386Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we conclude that Bcl-2 does not inhibit the release of Ca2+ from either of these stores. As discussed above, this depletion of intracellular Ca2+ induced apoptosis. The important observation made here is that Bcl-2 still prevented apoptosis in the absence of intracellular Ca2+ stores. Accordingly, we conclude that the protective action of Bcl-2 is independent of changes in intracellular Ca2+ stores. The previous reports that Ca2+ was depleted from thapsigargin-sensitive stores during apoptosis (23Baffy G. Miyashita T. Williamson J.R. Reed J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 6511-6519Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 25Distelhorst C.W. Lam M. McCormick T.S. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 2051-2055PubMed Google Scholar, 26Lam M. Dubyak G. Chen L. Nunez G. Miesfeld R.L. Distelhorst C.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Hence, Bcl-2 prevented the depletion of these stores as a consequence of its ability to prevent apoptosis.The question of how Bcl-2 functions remains elusive. In the Introduction, we explained why Bcl-2 is unlikely to act as a general antioxidant as was previously suggested (11Hockenbery D.M. Oltvai Z.N. Yin X.-M. Milliman C.L. Korsmeyer S.J.

Science. 1993; 262: 1274-1277Crossref PubMed Scopus (1613) Google Scholar). Bcl-2 has also been reported to function by influencing intracellular trafficking of the p53 tumor suppressor protein (45Ryan J.J. Prochownik E. Gottlieb C.A. Apel I.J. Merino R. Nunez G. Clarke M.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 5878-5882Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar), yet Bcl-2 protects cells that are mutant for p53 such as the CHO cells used here. Recently, it has been shown that Bcl-2 inhibits the activation of interleukin 1β converting enzyme-like proteases that are essential components of the execution phase of apoptosis (46Chinnaiyan A.M.

Chem. 1996; 271: 4573-4576Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (598) Google Scholar), yet this only adds to the list of events inhibited by Bcl-2 and does not imply any direct interaction. In related experiments, we have shown that Bcl-2 prevents intracellular acidification that always occurs during apoptosis (21Reynolds J.E. Li J. Craig R.W. Eastman A. Exp. Cell Res. 1996; 225: 430-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Intracellular pH is known to be regulated by extracellular signals and intracellular protein kinase cascades that also prevent apoptosis. We have reported that the retinoblastoma susceptibility protein Rb is dephosphorylated during apoptosis reflecting an imbalance between these same protein kinases and their related protein phosphatases (47Morana S. Wolf C.M. Li J. Reynolds J.E. Brown M.K. Eastman A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18263-18271Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Subsequently, we have shown that Bcl-2 prevents the dephosphorylation of Rb, and that this occurs upstream of activation of interleukin 1β converting enzyme-like proteases, 2C. M. Wolf, J. M. Reynolds, S. J. Morana, and A. Eastman, submitted for publication. thereby confirming the existence of events between Bcl-2 and the activation of interleukin 1β converting enzyme-like proteases. Other work has suggested that Bcl-2 action might be mediated through its interaction with R-Ras or Raf-1 (48Fernandez-Sarabia M.J. Bischoff J.R.

Oncogene. 1994; 9: 2751-2756PubMed Google Scholar). This might explain the recent reports of an imbalance between different mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways, specifically ERK1 and ERK2 appear to protect cells, while JNK/SAPK and p38 appear to be pro-apoptotic (50Eastman A.

Hence, the current evidence points toward a probable role for Bcl-2 in modifying protein kinase/phosphatase cascades that impact upon the eventual survival or demise of a cell. INTRODUCTIONApoptotic cell death is characterized morphologically by cell shrinkage, cytoplasmic vacuolization, and nuclear chromatin condensation (1Kerr J.F.R. Wyllie A.H. Currie A.R. Br. J.

Stimulation of increases in the intracellular concentration of cyclic AMP ([cAMP]i) by PGE2, misoprostol, and butaprost and of increases in the intracellular concentration of calcium ([Ca2+]i) by PGE2 and sulprostone demonstrated the respective involvement of EP2/EP4 Rs and EP3 Rs in transduction of biochemical signals.

Smith W.L. Narumiya S. Pharmacol. Rev. 1994; 46: 205-229PubMed Google Scholar). Cell surface expression of multiple functionally distinct subtypes of PGE2 receptors (Rs) is a principal determinant of the diversity and specificity of cellular effects of PGE2. PGE2 is recognized and transduces cellular effects specifically by interacting with PGE2 Rs of at least four subtypes, designated the EP1, EP2, EP3, and EP4 Rs. These subtypes of PGE2 Rs differ in structure, ligand-binding properties, tissue distribution, and coupling to signal transduction pathways (2Coleman R.A. Smith W.L. Narumiya S. Pharmacol. Rev. 1994; 46: 205-229PubMed Google Scholar). All subtypes of PGE2 Rs have recently been cloned and shown to be members of the G protein-coupled seven-transmembrane domain superfamily (1Coleman, R. A., Kennedy, I., Humphrey, P. P. A., Bunce, K., Lumley, P., Emmet, J. C., (eds) (1990) Comprehensive Medicinal Chemistry, Vol 3, p. 643, Pergammon Press, Oxford.Google Scholar, 2Coleman R.A.

EP2 and EP4 Rs activate adenylyl cyclase via Gs and stimulate increases in the intracellular concentration of cAMP ([cAMP]i) (4Regan J.W. Barley T.J. Pepperl D.J. Pierce K.L. Bogardus A.M.

Multiple isoforms of EP3 Rs not only inhibit adenylyl cyclase, resulting in a decrease in [cAMP]i elevated by forskolin or other agonists via Gi, but also stimulate increases in [Ca2+]i via Gi/Go or Gq (1Coleman, R.

Certain isoforms of the EP3 R in nonhuman species also activate adenylyl cyclase via Gs and transduce increases in [cAMP]i (8Namba T. Sugimoto Y. Negishi M. Irie A. Ushikubi F. Kakizuka A. Ito S.

An S. Smith W.C. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 1051-1058Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). At physiological concentrations, PGE2 enhances elements of macrophage differentiation but inhibits functional activation and enhances B cell production of IgG1 and IgE while inhibiting that of IgM (11Roper R.L. Phipps R.P. J. Immunol. 1992; 49: 2984-2991Google Scholar). Of central importance in most host defense and autoimmune responses is that PGE2 inhibits T cell proliferation, differentiation, expression of membrane Rs, secretion of diverse cytokines, cytotoxicity, and other specific effector functions in cellular immune reactions (10Goetzl E.J. An S. Smith W.C. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 1051-1058Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). Some PGE2 effects on T cells appear to be subset-selective, as for stimulation of the proliferative responses of a suppressor subset of T cells and concurrent suppression of the responses of a subset of helper T cells (10Goetzl E.J. An S. Smith W.C. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 1051-1058Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). PGE2 effects on T cells have been attributed almost exclusively to increases in [cAMP]i, which are transduced by EP2 and/or EP4 Rs. Expression of the EP3 subtype of PGE2 Rs by T cells at a level capable of altering T cell functions has not been described nor have the functional consequences of EP3 R-mediated signaling of T cells. The cultured line of human leukemic T cells, termed HSB.2, is an early “double negative” thymocyte bearing CD2 and CD7 but not CD3, CD4, or CD8 (12Adams R.A. Pothier L. Flowers A. Lazarus H. Farber S. Foley G.E. Exp. Cell Res. 1970; 62: 5-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 13Hara J. Benedict S.H. Champagne E. Mak T.W. Minden M. Gelfand E.W. J. Clin. Invest. 1988; 81: 989-996Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). It is now shown that HSB.2 T cells express predominantly the EP3 subtype of PGE2 R and that PGE2 stimulates increases in HSB.2 cellular content and secretion of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-9 by EP3 R-mediated and [Ca2+]i-dependent enhancement of transcription of mRNA encoding MMP-9.DISCUSSIONThe expression by T cells of multiple functionally distinct subtypes of PGE2 Rs, designated EP1, EP2, EP3, and EP4 Rs, is a principal determinant of specificity and diversity of the immune effects of PGE2 (1Coleman, R. A., Kennedy, I., Humphrey, P. P. A., Bunce, K., Lumley, P., Emmet, J. C., (eds) (1990) Comprehensive Medicinal Chemistry, Vol 3, p. 643, Pergammon Press, Oxford.Google Scholar, 2Coleman R.A. Smith W.L. Narumiya S. Pharmacol. Rev. 1994; 46: 205-229PubMed Google Scholar). Regulation of T cell functions was not attributed previously to EP3 Rs. We now show that the cultured line of human leukemic T cells, termed HSB.2, co-expresses a total of 7282 ± 1805 EP3, EP4, and EP2 Rs per cell with a Kd of 3.7 ± 1.4 nM. HSB.2 T cells differ from blood and lymphoid tissue T cells in expressing predominantly EP3 Rs and lower levels of EP2 Rs and EP4 Rs. The EP3/EP1 R-selective agonist sulprostone and EP3/EP2/EP4 R-selective agonists M&B 28767 and misoprostol competitively inhibited the binding of [3H]PGE2 to HSB.2 cells (Fig. 1). In contrast, the EP2 R-selective agonist butaprost inhibited [3H]PGE2 binding much less at only the highest concentration of 10−6M, and the EP1 R-selective antagonist SC-19220 did not alter [3H]PGE2 binding (Fig. 1). These results indicated predominant expression of EP3 Rs, fewer EP4 Rs, a much lower level of EP2 Rs, and no detectable EP1 Rs in HSB.2 cells.Assessment of adenylyl cyclase signaling revealed that PGE2, misoprostol, and a higher concentration of butaprost evoked increases in [cAMP]i in HSB.2 cells (Fig. 2), confirming expression of functional EP4 Rs and EP2 Rs. The isoforms of EP3 Rs in some nonhuman species that transduce increases in [cAMP]i (8Namba T. Sugimoto Y. Negishi M. Irie A. Ushikubi F. Kakizuka A. Ito S. Ichikawa A. Narumiya S. Nature. 1993; 365: 166-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (515) Google Scholar, 9Irie A. Sugimoto Y. Namba T. Harazono A. Honda A. Watabe A. Negishi M. Narumiya S. Ichikawa A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 217: 313-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar) were not detected in HSB.2 cells, because the EP3 R-selective agonist sulprostone did not stimulate increases in [cAMP]i (Fig. 2). This is consistent with our previous finding that none of the human EP3 R isoforms mediated an increase in [cAMP]i (7An S. Yang J. So S.W. Zeng L. Goetzl E.J. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 14496-14502Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). The increases in [Ca2+]i by PGE2 and the EP3/EP1 R-selective agonist sulprostone and the failure of a maximal concentration of the EP1 R-selective antagonist SC-19220 to dampen increases in [Ca2+]i evoked by sulprostone (Table I) argue strongly against the presence of EP1 Rs in HSB.2 cells and confirm the presence of functionally relevant EP3 Rs. EP1 Rs mediate increases in [Ca2+]i by stimulating the entry of extracellular Ca2+ (3Watabe A. Sugimoto Y. Honda A. Irie A. Namba T. Negishi M. Ito S. Narumiya S. Ichikawa A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20175-20178Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); thus our finding that the elevations of [Ca2+]i by PGE2 and sulprostone were not changed by elimination of extracellular Ca2+ further confirms the absence of EP1 Rs in HSB.2 cells. EP3 Rs are therefore the exclusive transducers of increases in [Ca2+]i evoked by PGE2 in HSB.2 cells.A family of MMPs is the principal physiological system that degrades diverse components of extracellular matrix (21Birkedal-Hansen H.

In human blood T cells and some human T lymphoblastoma cells, PGE2 stimulates surface expression and secretion of MMPs-2, −3, and −9, which create channels in the basement membrane required to admit migrating blood T cells and Tsup-1 cells (15Leppert D.

Using HSB.2 cells as a T cell model, we thus examined the possibility that EP3 Rs mediate regulation of MMPs in T cells responding to PGE2 and the biochemical signaling mechanisms by which EP3 Rs transduce PGE2-evoked increases in MMPs. We demonstrated that stimulation of MMP-9 in HSB.2 cells by PGE2 is attributable to [Ca2+]i-dependent EP3 R mediation of increases in message transcription.It has been reported that treatment of HSB.2 cells with the tumor promoter 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate elicits secretion of MMP-9 activity (23Zhou H. Bernhard E.J. Fox F.E. Billings P.C. Biochem. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1179: 174-178Crossref Scopus (46) Google Scholar). We now confirm by zymography and Western blots that MMP-9 is the exclusive MMP secreted constitutively by HSB.2 cells. Zymographic analyses revealed that the cytosolic level and secretion of MMP-9 were increased maximally after 24 h of incubation of HSB.2 cells with 10−7-10−6M PGE2. Parallel Western blot analyses showed that PGE2 stimulated MMP-9 activity in part by increasing both MMP-9 protein expression and secretion (Fig. 3). PGE1 but not PGF2α, PGD2, or PGI2 enhanced MMP-9 activity of HSB.2 cells to the same extent as PGE2, reflecting PGE2 R specificity on MMP-9 and the similar preference of PGE2 Rs for PGE2 and PGE1, which was observed in other immune cells (24Zeng L. An S. Goetzl E.J. Immunology. 1995; 86: 620-628PubMed Google Scholar). That the EP3 R-directed agonists sulprostone, M&B 28767, and misoprostol enhanced MMP-9 activity of HSB.2 cells to the same extent as PGE2 or higher, whereas the EP2 R-selective agonist butaprost did not (Fig. 4), supported the critical involvement of EP3 Rs in stimulation of HSB.2 T cell MMP-9 by PGE2.The potent effects of PGE2 on MMP-9 have been attributed principally to increases in [cAMP]i (25Mertz P.M.

Immunol. 1980; 124: 2405-2409PubMed Google Scholar), which are presumably transduced by EP2 and/or EP4 Rs. However, neither dibutyryl-cAMP nor the adenylyl cyclase stimulator forskolin and inhibitor SQ 22536 affected the cytosolic or secreted levels of MMP-9 in HSB.2 cells, confirming that [cAMP]i is not the mediator for effect of PGE2 on MMP-9 expression in HSB.2 T cells. This is consistent with the result that the EP2 R-selective agonist butaprost did not affect MMP-9 activity of HSB.2 cells. Thus the effect of PGE2 on MMP-9 of HSB.2 cells is not mediated by EP2 Rs or EP4 Rs.The finding that PGE2 stimulation of MMP-9 was not changed by elimination of extracellular Ca2+ but was suppressed by pretreatment with the Ca2+-ATPase inhibitor thapsigargin, which depletes intracellular Ca2+ (18Gouy H. Cefai D. Christensen S.B. Debre P. Bismuth G. Eur. J. Immunol. 1990; 20: 2269-2275Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 19Missiaen L. De Smedt H. Droogmans G. Casteels R. J. Biol.

Immunol. 1994; 152: 5226-5240PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 4), indicated the critical role of release of Ca2+ from intracellular stores in EP3 R mediation of MMP-9 secretion. Increases in [Ca2+]i appear to be necessary but insufficient for the effect of PGE2 on MMP-9 in HSB.2 cells, because incubation of the cells with 10−9-10−6M ionomycin in medium containing 1 mM Ca2+ did not mimic a PGE2 effect on MMP-9, although ionomycin evoked increases in [Ca2+]i of HSB.2 cells by a maximal 100-fold enhancement at 10−6M. Other unidentified signals that were simultaneously evoked by PGE2 binding to EP3 Rs along with the increases of [Ca2+]i released from intracellular stores also may be required for the PGE2 effect. IP3 formation in HSB.2 cells was not changed significantly by up to 10−6M PGE2 (data not shown), suggesting either that EP3 Rs transduced production of small amounts of IP3 that could not be detected in whole-cells assays but was capable of evoking increases in [Ca2+]i in HSB.2 cells or that the increases in [Ca2+]i from intracellular stores result from an IP3-independent mechanism. It was shown that TG releases stored Ca2+ from intracellular pools without production of IP3 (20Premack B.A. McDonald T.V. Gardner P. J. Immunol. 1994; 152: 5226-5240PubMed Google Scholar, 18Gouy H. Cefai D. Christensen S.B. Debre P. Bismuth G. Eur. J. Immunol. 1990; 20: 2269-2275Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), but there is a large degree of overlap between the IP3- and TG-sensitive Ca2+ pools (20Premack B.A. McDonald T.V. Gardner P. J. Immunol. 1994; 152: 5226-5240PubMed Google Scholar). We suggest in this study that PGE2 and TG mobilize Ca2+ from common intracellular pools. Thus, the PGE2-mediated increase in [Ca2+]i via EP3 Rs in HSB.2 cells may be from both TG-sensitive and IP3-sensitive pools.All subtypes of PGE2 Rs are members of the G protein-coupled seven-transmembrane domain superfamily. We have shown previously that elevation of [Ca2+]i mediated by all human EP3 R isoforms was partially blocked by pertussis toxin treatment (7An S. Yang J. So S.W. Zeng L. Goetzl E.J. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 14496-14502Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). The PGE2-enhanced effect on cytosolic and secreted MMP-9 in HSB.2 cells also was partially blocked by 24 h of co-treatment with 100 ng/ml pertussis toxin without a change in the basal level of MMP-9 (data not shown), implying involvement of both pertussis toxin-sensitive and pertussis toxin-insensitive G proteins in signal transduction. LPS-triggered secretion of MMP-9 in macrophages involves both protein kinase C and protein-tyrosine kinase (29Xie B. Dong Z. Fidler I. J. Immunol. 1994; 152: 3637-3644PubMed Google Scholar). src-related protein-tyrosine kinase plays a role in MMP-9 transcriptional activation (30Sato H. Kita M. Seiki M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23460-23468Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). 12-O-Tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate-enhanced MMP-9 activity in HSB cells also is mediated through activation of protein kinase C (23Zhou H. Bernhard E.J. Fox F.E. Billings P.C. Biochem. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1179: 174-178Crossref Scopus (46) Google Scholar). However, the PGE2 effect on MMP-9 in HSB.2 T cells was independent of protein kinase C, protein-tyrosine kinase, protein kinase A, and protein kinase G. Co-treatment of HSB.2 cells with the protein kinase C inhibitors staurosporine or calphostin C at concentrations of 10−10-10−7M, with protein-tyrosine kinase inhibitors genistein and tyrphostin at concentrations of 10−7-10−4M, or with protein kinase A/protein kinase G inhibitors H-89 and KT5720 at concentrations of 10−9-10−6M did not change the basal and PGE2 elevated level of MMP-9 (data not shown). Further work is needed to elucidate biochemical signal transduction mechanisms by which PGE2 affects MMP-9 in HSB.2 T cells.It has been demonstrated that MMP-1, −3, and −9 expression is regulated at the transcriptional level by factors including 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate, tumor necrosis factor α, epidermal growth factor, platelet-derived growth factor, nerve growth factor, interleukin-1, transforming growth factor-β, progesterone, and corticosteroids (21Birkedal-Hansen H.

Leppert D. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 1-4PubMed Google Scholar). We now show that PGE2 enhances MMP-9 expression by increasing transcription as well. Prevention of PGE2-induced increases in the cytosolic level and secretion of MMP-9 in HSB.2 cells by both protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide and RNA synthesis inhibitor actinomycin D suggested a requirement for de novo protein synthesis and transcription. Northern analyses revealed enhancement of the level of MMP-9 mRNA after 12-24 h of PGE2 treatment (Fig. 5). The ability of the EP3 R-directed agonist sulprostone to mimic a PGE2 stimulatory effect on MMP-9 mRNA (Fig. 5) supports the hypothesis that EP3 Rs signal predominantly at the transcriptional level. Thus, stimulation of MMP-9 in HSB.2 T cells by PGE2 is attributable to [Ca2+]i-dependent EP3 R-mediation of increases in message transcription.The HSB.2 T cell (12Adams R.A. Pothier L. Flowers A. Lazarus H. Farber S. Foley G.E. Exp. Cell Res. 1970; 62: 5-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) is at an early thymocyte stage (13Hara J. Benedict S.H. Champagne E. Mak T.W. Minden M. Gelfand E.W. J. Clin. Invest. 1988; 81: 989-996Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) and expresses predominantly EP3 and EP4 Rs, of which the former is the principal transducer of PGE2 effects on MMP-9. However, mature human blood CD4+ and CD8+ T cells express principally EP4 Rs and only the CD8+ subset bears a prominent number of EP3 Rs. 2L. Zeng, S. An, and E. J. Goetzl, unpublished data. In human blood T cells of mixed CD4+ and CD8+ composition, PGE2 stimulates surface expression and secretion of MMP-2 and −3, as well as MMP-9 (15Leppert D. Hauser S.L. Kishiyama J.L. An S. Zeng L. Goetzl E.J. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 1473-1481Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar), but the PGE2 R subtype dependence has not been defined. Whether HSB.2 cell is representative of human normal early thymocytes and whether the EP3 Rs of CD8+ T cells transduce increases in MMP-9 content and secretion remain to be evaluated in the corresponding population of T cells.

Smith W.L. Narumiya S. Pharmacol. Rev. 1994; 46: 205-229PubMed Google Scholar). Cell surface expression of multiple functionally distinct subtypes of PGE2 receptors (Rs) is a principal determinant of the diversity and specificity of cellular effects of PGE2. PGE2 is recognized and transduces cellular effects specifically by interacting with PGE2 Rs of at least four subtypes, designated the EP1, EP2, EP3, and EP4 Rs. These subtypes of PGE2 Rs differ in structure, ligand-binding properties, tissue distribution, and coupling to signal transduction pathways (2Coleman R.A. Smith W.L. Narumiya S. Pharmacol. Rev. 1994; 46: 205-229PubMed Google Scholar). All subtypes of PGE2 Rs have recently been cloned and shown to be members of the G protein-coupled seven-transmembrane domain superfamily (1Coleman, R.

EP2 and EP4 Rs activate adenylyl cyclase via Gs and stimulate increases in the intracellular concentration of cAMP ([cAMP]i) (4Regan J.W. Barley T.J. Pepperl D.J. Pierce K.L. Bogardus A.M.

INTRODUCTIONThe respiratory Rieske iron-sulfur (FeS) protein is an intrinsic constituent of cytochrome bc1-b6f complexes from mitochondria, chloroplasts, and certain bacteria found as part of the respiratory chain (1Trumpower B.L.

Although the Rieske-type FeS cluster consists of two Fe and two S2−, it has a high midpoint redox potential and shows characteristic optical and EPR spectra that are distinctively different from those of the conventional plant-type ferredoxins in which the [2Fe-2S] cluster is bound to four sulfide ligands contributed by four cysteine residues and two bridging sulfide ions. The [2Fe-2S] clusters of several ferredoxins involved in the bacterial dioxygenase systems also have spectral properties analogous to those of the respiratory Rieske FeS proteins (2Mason J.R. Cammack R. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1992; 46: 277-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar). These spectral properties have been interpreted by the asymmetric ligand environments around the [2Fe-2S] cluster, such that one of its iron atoms is coordinated to the protein by two sulfide ligands contributed by two cysteine residues, while the other is coordinated by two nitrogens contributed by two putative histidine residues (4Fee J.A.

In addition to these membrane-bound FeS centers, the archaeal soluble fraction exhibits another gy = 1.91 EPR signal, which is attributed to a soluble purple FeS protein, tentatively called “sulredoxin.” The initial characterization of sulredoxin by the absorption, CD, and EPR spectroscopic techniques, in conjunction with chemical analysis, suggested the presence of a single Rieske-type [2Fe-2S] cluster in sulredoxin with an average g-factor of 1.90 (21Iwasaki T. Isogai T. Iizuka T. Oshima T. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 2576-2582Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The size of sulredoxin determined by mass spectroscopy (12,155 Da (21Iwasaki T. Isogai T. Iizuka T.

In addition, because sulredoxin represents the only example of a soluble Rieske-type [2Fe-2S] protein so far purified from an archaeal species, it is of particular interest to investigate its redox property and to compare it with those of the mitochondrial and bacterial Rieske-type FeS proteins. In this paper, we report the potentiometric and the absorption, CD, and low temperature resonance Raman spectral properties of sulredoxin and discuss the nature of the redox-linked ionization of the archaeal Rieske-type [2Fe-2S] protein. We suggest that sulredoxin provides a new tractable model of the membrane-bound Rieske FeS protein found as part of the respiratory chain. INTRODUCTIONThe respiratory Rieske iron-sulfur (FeS) protein is an intrinsic constituent of cytochrome bc1-b6f complexes from mitochondria, chloroplasts, and certain bacteria found as part of the respiratory chain (1Trumpower B.L.

Although the Rieske-type FeS cluster consists of two Fe and two S2−, it has a high midpoint redox potential and shows characteristic optical and EPR spectra that are distinctively different from those of the conventional plant-type ferredoxins in which the [2Fe-2S] cluster is bound to four sulfide ligands contributed by four cysteine residues and two bridging sulfide ions. The [2Fe-2S] clusters of several ferredoxins involved in the bacterial dioxygenase systems also have spectral properties analogous to those of the respiratory Rieske FeS proteins (2Mason J.R. Cammack R. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1992; 46: 277-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar). These spectral properties have been interpreted by the asymmetric ligand environments around the [2Fe-2S] cluster, such that one of its iron atoms is coordinated to the protein by two sulfide ligands contributed by two cysteine residues, while the other is coordinated by two nitrogens contributed by two putative histidine residues (4Fee J.A.

On the other hand, the midpoint redox potentials of the Rieske-type [2Fe-2S] proteins involved in the bacterial dioxygenase systems are invariant, at least up to pH 10 (2Mason J.R. Cammack R. Annu.

In the case of Sulfolobus sp. strain 7, at least two different Rieske-type FeS centers have been detected in the membranes; one exhibiting the gy = 1.89 EPR signal is a constituent of the archaeal respiratory terminal oxidase supercomplex, while the other exhibiting the gy = 1.91 signal is of unknown function (21Iwasaki T.

The latter center is only loosely attached to the membrane and is readily removed by washing the membrane in the presence of cholate, 1T. Iwasaki, and T. Oshima, unpublished results. as in the cases of the cognate weakly associated membrane proteins such as NADH dehydrogenase (28Wakao H. Wakagi T. Oshima T. J. Biochem.

In addition to these membrane-bound FeS centers, the archaeal soluble fraction exhibits another gy = 1.91 EPR signal, which is attributed to a soluble purple FeS protein, tentatively called “sulredoxin.” The initial characterization of sulredoxin by the absorption, CD, and EPR spectroscopic techniques, in conjunction with chemical analysis, suggested the presence of a single Rieske-type [2Fe-2S] cluster in sulredoxin with an average g-factor of 1.90 (21Iwasaki T. Isogai T. Iizuka T. Oshima T. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 2576-2582Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The size of sulredoxin determined by mass spectroscopy (12,155 Da (21Iwasaki T. Isogai T. Iizuka T. Oshima T. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 2576-2582Crossref PubMed Google Scholar)) is similar to those of the [2Fe-2S] proteins involved in the bacterial dioxygenase systems (12 kDa (2Mason J.R. Cammack R. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1992; 46: 277-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar)) but much smaller than that of a membrane-bound respiratory Rieske FeS protein of S. acidocaldarius strain DSM 639 (32 kDa (27Schmidt C.L. Anemüller S. Teixeira M. Schäfer G. FEBS Lett. 1995; 359: 239-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar)). Although the physiological function of sulredoxin remains unknown, as it did not function as an electron acceptor of the cognate NADH dehydrogenase (28Wakao H. Wakagi T. Oshima T. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1987; 102: 255-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), or the cognate ferredoxin-dependent enzymes such as 2-oxoacid:ferredoxin oxidoreductase (30Zhang Q. Iwasaki T. Wakagi T.

Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 2576-2582Crossref PubMed Google Scholar),1 it can be reproducibly purified in high purity and in the water-soluble and very stable form without detergents, thus being suitable for further physicochemical studies. In addition, because sulredoxin represents the only example of a soluble Rieske-type [2Fe-2S] protein so far purified from an archaeal species, it is of particular interest to investigate its redox property and to compare it with those of the mitochondrial and bacterial Rieske-type FeS proteins. In this paper, we report the potentiometric and the absorption, CD, and low temperature resonance Raman spectral properties of sulredoxin and discuss the nature of the redox-linked ionization of the archaeal Rieske-type [2Fe-2S] protein. We suggest that sulredoxin provides a new tractable model of the membrane-bound Rieske FeS protein found as part of the respiratory chain. We thank Dr. Y.

DESC was the most potent antagonist of spermine transport in ZR-75-1 human breast cancer cells, with Ki values of 5.0 ± 0.7, 80 ± 31, and 16 ± 3 µM for DESC, MESC, and DEASC, respectively. DESC also strongly blocked putrescine and spermidine uptake in ZR-75-1 cells (Ki = 1.6 ± 0.5 and 2.7 ± 1.1 µM, respectively). While DESC and MESC were purely competitive inhibitors of putrescine transport, DEASC was a mixed competitive/noncompetitive antagonist. Remarkably, DESC was virtually impermeant in ZR-75-1 cells despite its low Ki toward polyamine transport. The marked difference in affinity between DESC and MESC was essentially due to the tail-to-tail juxtaposition of two spermine-like structures, suggesting that dimeric ligands of the polyamine transporter might simultaneously interact with more than one binding site. While DESC strongly decreased the initial rate of [3H]spermidine transport, even a 40-fold molar excess of antagonist could not completely abolish intracellular spermidine accumulation. Moreover, as little as 0.3 µM spermidine fully restored growth in ZR-75-1 cells treated with an inhibitor of polyamine biosynthesis in the presence of 50 µM DESC, thus emphasizing the importance of uptake of trace amounts of exogenous polyamines. Thus, reducing the exogenous supply of polyamines with a potent competitive inhibitor may be kinetically inadequate to block replenishment of the polyamine pool in polyamine-depleted tumor cells that display high transport capacity. These results demonstrate that polyamine analogues cross-linked into a dimeric structure such as DESC interact with high affinity with the mammalian polyamine carrier without being used as substrates. These novel properties provide a framework for the design of specific irreversible inhibitors of the polyamine transporter, which should present advantages over competitive antagonists for an efficient blockade of polyamine transport in tumor cells.

INTRODUCTIONNatural polyamines (putrescine, spermidine, and spermine) play essential roles in the control of macromolecular synthesis and cell growth in eukaryotes (1Pegg A.E.

Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1995; 35: 55-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (706) Google Scholar). Although most tissues can synthesize polyamines, they also possess a specific plasma membrane transport system, which allows utilization of plasma sources of polyamines and the salvaging of polyamines spontaneously excreted by mammalian cells (4Seiler N. Dezeure F. Int. J. Biochem. 1990; 22: 211-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar, 5Pegg A.E. Poulin R. Coward J.K. Int. J. Biochem. Cell.

Although eukaryotic polyamine transport has been the focus of numerous studies, no molecular information on the carrier molecules is yet available.Several specific inhibitors of polyamine biosynthesis have been designed, such as the ornithine decarboxylase suicide substrate, α-difluoromethylornithine (DFMO), 1The abbreviations used are: DFMOα-difluoromethylornithineMESCN-(2-mercaptoethyl)-spermine 5-carboxamideDESC2,2′-dithiobis(N-ethyl-spermine-5-carboxamide)FABMSfast atomic bombardment spectrometryLSIMSliquid secondary ion mass spectrometryDEASCN-[2,2′-dithio(ethyl,1′-aminoethyl)]-spermine 5-carboxamideLYlucifer yellowASIB1-(p-azidosalicylamido)-4-(iodoacetamido)butaneBoctert-butyl carbonylFBSfetal bovine serumSAOserum amine oxidaseHPLChigh performance liquid chromatographyDTTdithiothreitolPBSphosphate-buffered salineCHOChinese hamster ovaryCHXcycloheximide. which deplete polyamines with subsequent growth arrest in virtually all known mammalian cell types in culture (1Pegg A.E.

Bey P. Pegg A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 150-158Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Based on these premises, DFMO has been extensively assessed for the treatment of proliferative diseases, including several tumor types, in experimental models and in clinical trials (1Pegg A.E. Cancer Res. 1988; 48: 759-774PubMed Google Scholar, 3Marton L.J. Pegg A.E. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1995; 35: 55-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (706) Google Scholar), but its in vivo antitumor efficacy was found to be limited. The failure of DFMO to halt tumor growth in animal models has been correlated with the elevated polyamine transport activity found in transformed cells and its up-regulation as a result of polyamine depletion (4Seiler N. Dezeure F. Int. J. Biochem. 1990; 22: 211-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar, 6Byers T.L. Pegg A.E. J. Cell. Physiol. 1990; 143: 460-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Thus, decontamination of the gastrointestinal tract, which is the main vector of circulating polyamines through bacterial microflora activity, along with a polyamine-free diet (8Sarhan S. Knödgen B. Seiler N. Anticancer Res. 1989; 9: 215-224PubMed Google Scholar, 9Hessels J. Kingma A.W. Ferwerda H. Keij J. Van der Berg G.A. Muskiet F.A.J. Int. J. Cancer. 1989; 43: 1115-1166Crossref Scopus (63) Google Scholar), markedly potentiate the in vivo efficacy of DFMO against tumor progression (10Ask A. Persson L. Heby O. Cancer Lett. 1992; 66: 29-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 11Seiler N. Sarhan S. Grauffel C. Jones R. Knödgen B. Moulinoux J.-P. Cancer Res. 1990; 50: 5077-5083PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, mutant leukemia cells deficient in polyamine transport are much more susceptible than parental cells to growth inhibition by DFMO in vivo (10Ask A. Persson L. Heby O. Cancer Lett. 1992; 66: 29-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 12Persson L. Holm I. Ask A. Heby O. Cancer Res. 1988; 48: 4807-4811PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, polyamine transport has major implications for antitumor therapies based on polyamine depletion.An obvious strategy to block accumulation of exogenous polyamines by tumor cells might be the use of a specific transport antagonist. Ideally, candidate molecules should have high affinity for binding to the polyamine carrier but should not be internalized by the polyamine transport system, or if they are substrates, they should not mimic the biological activities of natural polyamines. In the course of studies on the structure of the polyamine transporter, we have synthesized N-(2-mercaptoethyl)-spermine 5-carboxamide (MESC; Fig. 1) as a precursor for the synthesis of affinity ligands to label the polyamine carrier. Unexpectedly, we have found that the disulfide form of this compound, or 2,2′-dithiobis(N-ethyl-spermine-5-carboxamide) (DESC; Fig. 1) exhibits a much higher affinity than MESC for the polyamine transport system, while being virtually impermeant. In this report, we describe the synthesis and biochemical properties of these compounds and provide evidence that DESC has the attributes expected of a pure and potent competitive antagonist of the polyamine transport system.DISCUSSIONWe have shown that DESC, a novel type of spermine analogue, is endowed with high affinity for the polyamine transport system while being highly resistant to cellular uptake. The combination of these two attributes confers unique characteristics on DESC as a pure competitive antagonist of polyamine uptake. Only few attempts have been made previously to design specific inhibitors of polyamine transport. Based on the finding that paraquat (4,4′-bipyridine) is a substrate of the putrescine transport system (38Smith L.L. Wyatt I. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1981; 30: 1053-1058Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 39Rannels D.E. Pegg A.E. Clark R.S. Addison J.L. Am. J. Physiol. 1985; 249: E506-E513PubMed Google Scholar), Minchin et al. (40Minchin R.F. Martin R.L. Summers L.A. Ilett K.F. Biochem. J. 1989; 262: 391-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) have synthesized a series of polypyridinium salts, including compounds with a low Ki against putrescine uptake and low acute toxicity for mammalian cells. However, it is unclear whether such compounds can efficiently inhibit polyamine transport or are accumulated intracellularly. More recently, a high molecular mass (∼25-kDa) spermine polymer has been described as a competitive inhibitor of polyamine transport with a Ki in the 10−6M range, but its usefulness at specifically blocking polyamine accumulation is uncertain because of its marked cytotoxicity (41Aziz S.M. Tofiq S.F. Gosland M.P. Olson J.W. Gillespie M.N. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1995; 274: 181-196PubMed Google Scholar).As compared with spermine, the higher Ki of MESC against putrescine, spermidine, and spermine uptake could be due to the presence of an amide linkage, which decreases the basicity of the neighboring secondary amino group of the spermine head (pKa∼5.5 in comparison with 8.9-9.8 for spermine) (2Tabor C.W. Tabor H. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1984; 53: 749-790Crossref PubMed Scopus (3221) Google Scholar, 42Remy J.-S. Kichler A. Mordvinov V. Schuber F. Behr J.-P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1744-1748Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar), and/or may cause steric hindrance for its interaction with the polyamine binding site (27Bergeron R.J. Seligsohn H.W. Bioinorg. Chem. 1986; 14: 345-355Crossref Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 28Porter C.W. Cavanaugh Jr., P.F. Stolowich N. Ganis B. Kelly E. Bergeron R.J. Cancer Res. 1985; 45: 2050-2057PubMed Google Scholar). Nevertheless, despite the unfavorable structural features of MESC as a ligand, its dimerization into DESC increased by ≥20-fold the affinity of the resulting structure for the polyamine transporter. Although there is no precedent for dimeric polyamine structures like DESC, its overall design is reminiscent of that of 2-N-4-(1-azi-2,2,2-trifluoroethyl)benzoyl-1,3-bis(D-mannos-4-yloxy)-2-propylamine, an impermeant ligand that binds to the exofacial domain of facilitative glucose transporters and bears two symmetrical sugar moieties linked tail to tail (43Clark A.E. Holman G.D. Biochem. J. 1990; 269: 615-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). It is noteworthy that at least one mammalian glucose transporter, namely GLUT-1, exists as a tetrameric complex in its native form (44Hebert D.N. Carruthers A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23829-23838Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 45Gould G.W. Holman G.D. Biochem. J. 1993; 295: 329-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (650) Google Scholar). It is therefore conceivable that the stronger affinity of DESC relative to MESC could reflect a dyad symmetry in the organization of the transporter complex. Alternatively, dimerization of MESC into DESC could impose conformational constraints (e.g. due to electrostatic repulsion) that would favor recognition of the polyamine binding site of the carrier by each of the symmetrical spermine moieties.MESC thioethers as diverse in size as MESC-LY, MESC-ASIB, or MESC-acetamide have Ki values virtually identical to that of MESC, indicating that the thiol group of MESC does not specifically determine its lower affinity as a polyamine transport inhibitor as compared with DESC. Moreover, these data suggest that additional bulk on the side chain has little influence on the interaction of MESC with the polyamine transporter, in agreement with the observation that large substituents attached to the distal end of a spacer of sufficient length do not notably decrease the affinity of spermidine conjugates for uptake (46Holley J.L. Mather A. Wheelhouse R.T. Cullis P.M. Hartley J.A. Bingham J.P. Cohen G.M. Cancer Res. 1992; 52: 4190-4195PubMed Google Scholar).Unexpectedly, the MESC-cysteamine mixed disulfide (DEASC) blocked putrescine uptake as a mixed competitor/noncompetitor, whereas MESC and DESC behaved like pure competitive inhibitors in that respect. Since the interaction of DESC or MESC with the polyamine carrier was strictly competitive, and because DEASC has a higher affinity than MESC as an inhibitor of polyamine transport, the spermine head and the cysteamine side chain of DEASC might be responsible, respectively, for the competitive and noncompetitive components of its transport inhibition. It is noteworthy that cysteamine and aliphatic monoamines of similar chain length (e.g. n-butylamine and n-pentylamine) have low but significant ability to antagonize putrescine uptake (47Gordonsmith R.H. Brooke-Taylor S. Smith L.L. Cohen G.M. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1983; 32: 3701-3709Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), although the mode of inhibition of these compounds has not been reported.The biochemical properties of DESC clearly show that the binding affinity of an analogue can be dissociated from its ability to serve as a substrate for transport. The large size of DESC cannot be the main factor preventing its carrier-mediated internalization, since MESC was also virtually impermeant. Thus, the attachment of an amido side chain on the spermine backbone would appear to be responsible for the impaired internalization of these analogues. Indeed, N4-alkylated spermidine derivatives are much better competitors of spermidine uptake than their N4-acyl counterparts in mouse leukemia cells, suggesting that charged secondary amino groups are important for interaction with the polyamine carrier (28Porter C.W. Cavanaugh Jr., P.F. Stolowich N. Ganis B. Kelly E. Bergeron R.J. Cancer Res. 1985; 45: 2050-2057PubMed Google Scholar). However, the latter argument cannot account for the fact that aliphatic α,ω-diamines with at least 6 or 7 methylene groups have an affinity comparable with that of spermidine (23Lessard M. Zhao C. Singh S.M. Poulin R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1685-1694Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 27Bergeron R.J. Seligsohn H.W. Bioinorg.

Pharmacol. 1983; 32: 3701-3709Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). A more likely explanation for the poor affinity of polyamines bearing an acyl side chain might be the steric hindrance due to the amide group, which restricts freedom of rotation around the adjacent carbon and nitrogen atoms. There are indications that cyclic or pseudocyclic conformations of polyamines stabilized by hydrogen bonds might be energetically favored for recognition and/or internalization by the polyamine transporter (23Lessard M. Zhao C. Singh S.M. Poulin R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1685-1694Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 27Bergeron R.J. Seligsohn H.W. Bioinorg. Chem. 1986; 14: 345-355Crossref Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The formation of such folded conformers would be impaired by close proximity of an amide group to the polyamine chain.Although a 40-fold molar excess of DESC dramatically reduced the rate of spermidine uptake in ZR-75-1 cells, a low but sustained spermidine accumulation was still observed in the presence of the inhibitor. Furthermore, DESC was slowly inactivated in growth media due to disulfide-disulfide exchange with L-cystine (about 40% degradation after 48 h), although the compound was intrinsically stable in thiol-free aqueous solutions (data not shown). These two factors may largely account for the complete inability of DESC to block polyamine-mediated prevention of growth inhibition by DFMO. Growth inhibition associated with DFMO-induced polyamine depletion in ZR-75-1 cells was completely reversed by concentrations of spermidine as low as 300 nM, i.e. such as those found in human plasma (48Moulinoux J.-P. Quemener V. Khan N.A. Cell. Mol. Biol. 1991; 37: 773-783PubMed Google Scholar, 49Scalabrino G. Ferioli M.E. Adv. Cancer Res. 1981; 36: 1-102Google Scholar, 50Bachrach U. Bachrach U. Heimer Y.M. The Physiology of Polyamines. Vol II. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL1989: 235-249Google Scholar). The striking efficiency of the transport system to salvage exogenous polyamines in DFMO-treated cells is due to its up-regulation consequent to polyamine depletion (4Seiler N. Dezeure F. Int. J. Biochem. 1990; 22: 211-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar, 6Byers T.L. Pegg A.E. J. Cell. Physiol. 1990; 143: 460-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 23Lessard M. Zhao C.

Biochem. 1988; 176: 409-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). These data reinforce the view that cellular import of exogenous polyamines is a major factor limiting the efficacy of polyamine biosynthesis inhibitors as antitumor agents in vivo (8Sarhan S. Knödgen B. Seiler N. Anticancer Res. 1989; 9: 215-224PubMed Google Scholar, 9Hessels J. Kingma A.W. Ferwerda H. Keij J. Van der Berg G.A. Muskiet F.A.J. Int. J. Cancer. 1989; 43: 1115-1166Crossref Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 10Ask A. Persson L. Heby O. Cancer Lett. 1992; 66: 29-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 11Seiler N. Sarhan S. Grauffel C. Jones R. Knödgen B. Moulinoux J.-P. Cancer Res. 1990; 50: 5077-5083PubMed Google Scholar, 12Persson L. Holm I. Ask A. Heby O. Cancer Res. 1988; 48: 4807-4811PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, unless substantial gains in affinity are achieved in the design of competitive inhibitors of polyamine uptake, their efficacy will be kinetically limited by residual transport. In support of this view, mutations of the polyamine transport system make tumor cells much more susceptible to in vivo growth inhibition by DFMO than limiting the supply of exogenous polyamines (10Ask A. Persson L. Heby O. Cancer Lett. 1992; 66: 29-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Thus, irreversible inhibition of polyamine transport might present major advantages over pure competition as a strategy to block polyamine uptake. The same rationale has been applied to the inhibition of ornithine decarboxylase, which is better achieved with suicide substrates like DFMO than with competitive inhibitors (52Pegg A.E. McCann P.P. Am. J. Physiol. 1982; 243: C212-C221Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 53Mamont P.S. Duchesne M.-C. Grove J. Bey P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1978; 81: 58-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar). Moreover, the efficacy of an irreversible inactivation of mammalian polyamine carriers would be advantaged by the apparently long half-life of these transporters (6Byers T.L. Pegg A.E. J. Cell. Physiol. 1990; 143: 460-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The inherent structural features of DESC that confer its high affinity and resistance to uptake should provide a useful framework for the design of potent irreversible inhibitors of polyamine transport.Since the affinity of MESC thioethers remains virtually unaffected relative to the unconjugated polyamine, MESC-ASIB might serve as a photoaffinity label to detect polyamine-binding proteins, including the polyamine carrier. Experiments are currently conducted with 125I-labeled MESC-ASIB to assess its usefulness as a probe to identify the mammalian polyamine transporter. Felschow et al. (54Felschow D.M. MacDiarmid J. Bardos T. Wu R. Woster P.M. Porter C.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28705-28711Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar) have described the specific labeling of discrete plasma membrane proteins, using 125I-labeled N1-azidosalicylamido-norspermine and N4-azidosalicylamidoethyl-spermidine as photoaffinity reagents. However, these conjugates are internalized by mammalian cells (54Felschow D.M. MacDiarmid J. Bardos T. Wu R. Woster P.M. Porter C.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28705-28711Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar), and MESC-ASIB or similar derivatives could be useful as photoactivable probes to exclude labeling of intracellular proteins.The cytotoxicity of high concentrations of DESC and MESC is unlikely to be due to the formation of mixed disulfides between DESC and L-cystine, since MESC was less toxic than DESC, despite the fact that the free thiol group of MESC would make it more reactive toward L-cystine. Moreover, degradation (data not shown) and cytotoxicity could be associated with amine oxidation only in the case of DEASC. Cystamine is a well-known substrate for diamine oxidase (55Cooper A.J.L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1983; 52: 187-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar, 56Cavallini D. De Marco C. Mondovi B. Experientia. 1956; 12: 377-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar), and the half-cystamine side chain of DEASC could be susceptible to attack by that serum enzyme. However, causes for the apparent lack of degradation of MESC and DESC by SAO are less clear, since, like spermine, both compounds have free aminopropyl ends, which are the basic substrate requirements for SAO (20Morgan D.M.L. Bachrach U. Heimer Y.M. The Physiology of Polyamines. Vol I. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL1989: 203-229Google Scholar, 57Kawase M. Samejima K. Okada M. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1982; 31: 2983-2988Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The presence per se of a bulky side group does not prevent the attack of polyamine conjugates by SAO (18Pegg A.E. Wechter R. Poulin R. Woster P.M. Coward J.K. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 8446-8453Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). On the other hand, DESC and MESC cytotoxicity could result from their slow but detectable internalization. The very low rate of MESC and DESC accumulation could result in part from endocytosis as well as diffusion, which becomes increasingly important at concentrations >10−4M for compounds like spermine (58Brunton V.G. Grant M.H. Wallace H.M. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1990; 40: 1893-1900Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 59Brüne B. Hartzell P. Nicotera P. Orrenius S. Exp. Cell Res. 1991; 195: 323-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, the present data clearly show that DESC has remarkably low toxicity in comparison with spermine. Thus, the basic features of this molecule should be useful for the design of potent transport inhibitors endowed with low cytotoxicity. INTRODUCTIONNatural polyamines (putrescine, spermidine, and spermine) play essential roles in the control of macromolecular synthesis and cell growth in eukaryotes (1Pegg A.E. Cancer Res. 1988; 48: 759-774PubMed Google Scholar, 2Tabor C.W. Tabor H. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1984; 53: 749-790Crossref PubMed Scopus (3221) Google Scholar, 3Marton L.J. Pegg A.E. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1995; 35: 55-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (706) Google Scholar). Although most tissues can synthesize polyamines, they also possess a specific plasma membrane transport system, which allows utilization of plasma sources of polyamines and the salvaging of polyamines spontaneously excreted by mammalian cells (4Seiler N. Dezeure F. Int. J. Biochem. 1990; 22: 211-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar, 5Pegg A.E. Poulin R. Coward J.K. Int. J. Biochem. Cell.

Although eukaryotic polyamine transport has been the focus of numerous studies, no molecular information on the carrier molecules is yet available.Several specific inhibitors of polyamine biosynthesis have been designed, such as the ornithine decarboxylase suicide substrate, α-difluoromethylornithine (DFMO), 1The abbreviations used are: DFMOα-difluoromethylornithineMESCN-(2-mercaptoethyl)-spermine 5-carboxamideDESC2,2′-dithiobis(N-ethyl-spermine-5-carboxamide)FABMSfast atomic bombardment spectrometryLSIMSliquid secondary ion mass spectrometryDEASCN-[2,2′-dithio(ethyl,1′-aminoethyl)]-spermine 5-carboxamideLYlucifer yellowASIB1-(p-azidosalicylamido)-4-(iodoacetamido)butaneBoctert-butyl carbonylFBSfetal bovine serumSAOserum amine oxidaseHPLChigh performance liquid chromatographyDTTdithiothreitolPBSphosphate-buffered salineCHOChinese hamster ovaryCHXcycloheximide. which deplete polyamines with subsequent growth arrest in virtually all known mammalian cell types in culture (1Pegg A.E.

Bey P. Pegg A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 150-158Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Based on these premises, DFMO has been extensively assessed for the treatment of proliferative diseases, including several tumor types, in experimental models and in clinical trials (1Pegg A.E. Cancer Res. 1988; 48: 759-774PubMed Google Scholar, 3Marton L.J. Pegg A.E. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1995; 35: 55-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (706) Google Scholar), but its in vivo antitumor efficacy was found to be limited. The failure of DFMO to halt tumor growth in animal models has been correlated with the elevated polyamine transport activity found in transformed cells and its up-regulation as a result of polyamine depletion (4Seiler N. Dezeure F. Int. J. Biochem. 1990; 22: 211-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar, 6Byers T.L. Pegg A.E. J. Cell. Physiol. 1990; 143: 460-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Thus, decontamination of the gastrointestinal tract, which is the main vector of circulating polyamines through bacterial microflora activity, along with a polyamine-free diet (8Sarhan S. Knödgen B. Seiler N. Anticancer Res. 1989; 9: 215-224PubMed Google Scholar, 9Hessels J. Kingma A.W. Ferwerda H. Keij J. Van der Berg G.A. Muskiet F.A.J. Int. J. Cancer. 1989; 43: 1115-1166Crossref Scopus (63) Google Scholar), markedly potentiate the in vivo efficacy of DFMO against tumor progression (10Ask A. Persson L. Heby O. Cancer Lett. 1992; 66: 29-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 11Seiler N. Sarhan S. Grauffel C. Jones R. Knödgen B. Moulinoux J.-P. Cancer Res. 1990; 50: 5077-5083PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, mutant leukemia cells deficient in polyamine transport are much more susceptible than parental cells to growth inhibition by DFMO in vivo (10Ask A. Persson L. Heby O. Cancer Lett. 1992; 66: 29-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 12Persson L. Holm I. Ask A. Heby O. Cancer Res. 1988; 48: 4807-4811PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, polyamine transport has major implications for antitumor therapies based on polyamine depletion.An obvious strategy to block accumulation of exogenous polyamines by tumor cells might be the use of a specific transport antagonist. Ideally, candidate molecules should have high affinity for binding to the polyamine carrier but should not be internalized by the polyamine transport system, or if they are substrates, they should not mimic the biological activities of natural polyamines. In the course of studies on the structure of the polyamine transporter, we have synthesized N-(2-mercaptoethyl)-spermine 5-carboxamide (MESC; Fig. 1) as a precursor for the synthesis of affinity ligands to label the polyamine carri"

Treatment of T-cells with a variety of extracellular stimuli increases the phosphorylation of Lck on serine residues. This results in shifts in the apparent molecular weight of Lck to forms that exhibit reduced electrophoretic mobility on SDS-polyacrylamide gels. We found that as a result of arresting cells in mitosis, forms of Lck were generated that migrated with slower mobilities on SDS-polyacrylamide gels. This suggested that a serine/threonine kinase, active at mitosis, was phosphorylating Lck. Using antibodies to Lck and to the cyclin-dependent serine kinase, Cdc2, as well as the cyclin-dependent kinase affinity resin, Suc1-agarose, we detected a stable interaction between Lck and Cdc2. The interaction was mediated through the Src homology 3 domain of Lck and was selective, as only the active form of Cdc2 was found to associate with Lck. Moreover, Cdc2 was able to phosphorylate Lck in vitro and shift its electrophoretic mobility to a more slowly migrating form. An association between active Cdc2 and the Src-related kinases Lyn and Fyn was also demonstrated, although Cdc2 was not found associated with the tyrosine kinases, Csk and Syk.

Cell. 1989; 57: 763-774Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). It is well established that Src is activated at mitosis, and its mitosis-specific phosphorylation is thought to contribute to its activation (34Erpel T. Courtneidge S.A. Curr. Opin. Cell. Biol. 1995; 7: 176-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar, 35Taylor S.J. Shalloway D. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1993; 3: 26-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The recent identification of a specific mitotic substrate for Src (36Fumagalli S. Totty N.F. Hsuan J.J. Courtneidge S.A. Nature. 1994; 368: 871-874Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar, 37Taylor S.J. Shalloway D. Nature. 1994; 368: 867-871Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar) clearly implicates Src in mediating cell cycle-dependent events. In addition to Src, Src family members Fyn and Yes also have been reported to be activated during mitosis (34Erpel T. Courtneidge S.A. Curr. Opin. Cell. Biol. 1995; 7: 176-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). These observations prompted us to initiate studies to determine whether Lck becomes differentially phosphorylated during the cell cycle. We found that cells arrested in mitosis contained a form of Lck that exhibited a retarded mobility on SDS-polyacrylamide gels relative to Lck from cycling cells or cells arrested at the G1/S boundary of the cell cycle. This suggested that a serine kinase active at mitosis phosphorylated Lck. We found that in mitotic cells, the cyclin-dependent kinase Cdc2 associated with Lck, as well as with two other Src family members, Fyn and Lyn. Furthermore, Lck isolated from cycling cells was converted to a more slowly migrating form when phosphorylated by Cdc2. Antipeptide antibodies to residues 476-509 in the Lck sequence were prepared as described previously (38Wang Q. Srinivas P.R. Harrison M.L. Geahlen R.L. Biochem. J. 1991; 279: 567-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Antibodies to the unique C-terminal region of Cdc2 were obtained from Upstate Biotechnology Inc. Rabbit polyclonal anti-Fyn antibodies (directed against residues 28-48) and anti-Lyn antibodies (directed against residues 44-63) were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. Antipeptide antibodies directed against residues 422-450 of the Csk sequence were prepared as described (39Ford C.E. Furlong M.T. Geahlen R.L. Harrison M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30378-30385Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Antibodies to the p40 catalytic domain of Syk were prepared as described (40Zioncheck T.F. Harrison M.L. Isaacson C.C. Geahlen R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 19195-19202Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The murine cell line LSTRA, the human leukemia T-cell line Jurkat (clone E6-1, from the American Type Culture Collection), the Lck-deficient mutant of Jurkat (J.CaM1, American Type Culture Collection), and CEM-6 were grown and maintained as described (4Paige L.A. Nadler M.J.S. Harrison M.L. Cassady J.M. Geahlen R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8669-8674Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For cell cycle treatment experiments, cells (4 × 105 cells/ml) that were maintained in the log phase of growth were either left untreated or incubated in the presence of either aphidicolin (Boehringer Manheim, 0.5 µg/ml) or nocodazole (Sigma, 1 µg/ml) for 10 h (LSTRA cells) or 14 h (Jurkat and J.CaM1 cells) at 37°C. Flow cytometric analysis of blocked cells indicated that, after nocodazole treatment, approximately 60% of the cells had undergone mitotic arrest. Cells were equalized for cell number with untreated control cells and lysed in ice-cold lysis buffer containing 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 25 mM HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM sodium orthovanadate, and 20 µg/ml each of aprotinin and leupeptin at 4°C for 15 min. Samples were centrifuged at 13,000 × g (microcentrifuge), and the supernatants were subjected to immunoblotting, immunoprecipitation, or incubation with Suc-1-agarose resin. Murine thymocytes were isolated from 6-week-old mice as described (41Srinivas P.R. Ford C.E. Harrison M.L. Allergy Immunol. 1991; 10: 61-67Google Scholar). Thymocytes (3 × 106 cells/ml) were resuspended in RPMI 1640 medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented as described (39Ford C.E. Furlong M.T. Geahlen R.L. Harrison M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30378-30385Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) except that 10% inactivated fetal calf serum was used. Thymocytes were incubated in the absence or presence of ConA (5 µg/ml) for 48 h, prior to washing in phosphate-buffered saline and cell lysis. All cells were maintained at 37°C in a humidified incubator under an atmosphere of 6% CO2. Cells were equalized for cell number and lysed as described above. Samples were centrifuged at 13,000 × g (microcentrifuge) and the supernatants analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by transfer to Immobilon-P membranes. The membranes were blocked in TBST (15 mM Tris/HCl, pH 7.4, 0.9% NaCl, and 0.05% Tween 20) containing 2.5% BSA (Sigma) and 2.5% nonfat dried milk (Carnation) for 1 h followed by incubation with the rabbit antibodies described above. After extensive washings, the membranes were incubated for 1 h with goat anti-rabbit antibodies conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (Sigma) in TBST containing 5% goat serum, 1% BSA, and 1% nonfat dry milk. The immunoblots were analyzed using the ECL detection system (Amersham). For immunoblotting anti-Lck immunoprecipitations, proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to Immobilon-P, and blocked in TBST containing 0.2% methyl cellulose for 1 h, followed by incubation with anti-Cdc2 antibodies. After extensive washes, the membranes were incubated with monoclonal anti-rabbit antibodies conjugated to biotin (Sigma) for 45 min, followed by washing and incubation with the ABC peroxidase staining reagent (Pierce) for 30 min. The immunoblots were analyzed using the ECL detection system. Cell lysates were incubated at 4°C with anti-Lck antibodies bound to protein A-Sepharose (Sigma). The immune complexes were washed three times with ice-cold buffer containing 25 mM HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM sodium orthovanadate, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, and 20 µg/ml each of protease inhibitors leupeptin and aprotinin. The complexes were assayed in a 50-µl volume containing 25 mM HEPES, pH 7.4, 10 mM MnCl2, 5 mM p-nitrophenylphosphate, 5 µM sodium orthovanadate, 20 µg/ml each of aprotinin and leupeptin, 1 µM ATP (5 µCi of [γ-32P]ATP, DuPont NEN, 6000 Ci/mmol). Reactions were carried out at 30°C for 5 min. Phosphoproteins were separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to Immobilon-P, and detected by autoradiography. Prior to autoradiography, the membranes were incubated with 1 M KOH at 55°C for 1 h to preferentially remove radioactive phosphate from proteins phosphorylated on serine and threonine residues. Suc1-agarose (Oncogene Science) was incubated in blocking buffer containing 5% Ig-free BSA and 1% ovalbumin at 4°C for 1 h. The resin was washed in lysis buffer and incubated at 4°C for 1 h with lysates from cells that had undergone the various treatments indicated. Resins were analyzed by immunoblot analysis (Figs. 2, 3, and 7) or in vitro kinase assays (Fig. 2, Fig. 3, Fig. 4, Fig. 5, Fig. 6, Fig. 7). For immunoblot analysis, the resins were washed twice and Suc1-bound proteins were released by boiling in SDS-sample buffer for 5 min, followed by SDS-PAGE and transfer to Immobilon-P before incubation with the antibodies indicated. For in vitro kinase assays, the Suc1 resins were phosphorylated as described above for immune complex kinase assays. For the phosphorylation of Lck by Cdc2 (Fig. 7), Suc-1 resin containing both Cdc2 and Lck was resuspended in a final volume of 50 µl containing 25 mM HEPES, pH 7.4, 10 mM MgCl2, 20 µg/ml each of aprotinin and leupeptin, and 100 µM ATP. The kinase assays were performed at 24°C for 10 min. The phosphorylated Lck was released from the resin by boiling in SDS-sample buffer and resolved by SDS-PAGE. Lck was visualized by anti-Lck immunoblot analysis after the gel had been transferred to Immobilon-P.Fig. 3The binding of Lck to Suc1-agarose requires the presence of Cdc2. Detergent-solubilized lysates were prepared from resting mouse thymocytes (2.5 × 106 cells/lane, lanes 1, 3, and 5) or mouse thymocytes activated by treatment with ConA for 48 h (2.5 × 106 cells/lane, lanes 2, 4, and 6) and either loaded directly onto a 12% gel (lanes 1, 2, 5, and 6) in SDS-sample buffer or adsorbed to Suc1-agarose, eluted in SDS-sample buffer, and loaded (lanes 3 and 4).

C, detergent-solubilized lysates from untreated or cell-cycle arrested Jurkat cells were incubated with glutathione-Sepharose adsorbed with GST only (G), with GST fused to the SH2 domain of Lck (SH2), or with GST fused to the SH3 domain of Lck (SH3).

The glutathione-Sepharose resin was blocked as described above for the Suc1 resin. The resins were washed with lysis buffer and subjected to histone H1 kinase assays as described (30Shenoy S. Choi J.

The resins were then subjected to in vitro kinase assays as described above for immune complex kinase assays, except that the assays were for 2 min. These conditions promote the autophosphorylation of Lck and preclude the phosphorylation of Lck by Cdc2. Bound proteins were eluted by boiling in SDS-sample buffer, fractionated using SDS-PAGE, transferred to Immobilon-P, and treated with KOH before detection by autoradiography. E. coli that were infected with GST alone or GST fused to either the SH2 or SH3 domain of Lck (kinds gifts of André Veillette; 43Peri K.G. Gervais F.G. Weil R. Davidson D. Gish G.D. Veillette A. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 2765-2772PubMed Google Scholar) were sonicated and the clarified supernatants were incubated with glutathione-Sepharose as described above. In order to detect cell cycle-dependent covalent modifications of Lck, detergent-solubilized extracts were prepared from LSTRA or Jurkat T-cells that were left untreated or treated with the cell cycle blockers aphidicolin and nocodazole. The extracts were separated by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by immunoblot analysis with antibodies to Lck. As shown in Fig. 1A, anti-Lck antibodies detected a protein of Mr = 56,000 in lysates from cycling cells or from cells blocked in S phase with aphidicolin. However, lysates from cells blocked in mitosis by treatment with nocodazole contained an additional immunoreactive protein that exhibited a retarded electrophoretic mobility relative to the 56-kDa form of Lck. This slower migrating form of Lck was also observed in lysates of cells treated with colcemid, but not in lysates of cells treated with hydroxyurea (data not shown). As illustrated in Fig. 1B, similar results were obtained when Lck was isolated in anti-Lck immune complexes and detected by an in vitro kinase assay. Anti-Lck immunoprecipitates were formed from lysates of nocodazole-treated LSTRA cells (Fig. 1B) or Jurkat or CEM-6 T-cells (data not shown) and incubated in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP to generate autophosphorylated Lck. Again, only a single band of autophosphorylated Lck appeared in anti-Lck immune complexes formed from cycling cells or cells treated with aphidicolin, while Lck obtained from nocodazole-treated cells showed an additional, more slowly migrating band. Densitometric analysis revealed that the more slowly migrating band represented approximately 30% of the total Lck. Because approximately 60% of nocodazole-treated cells underwent mitotic arrest (see “Experimental Procedures”), we estimate that the more slowly migrating form of Lck represents 50% of the total Lck in mitotic cells. These results indicated that, as a result of arresting cells in mitosis, approximately half of the Lck was covalently modified as detected by a shift in its mobility on SDS-polyacrylamide gels. Forms of Lck with reduced electrophoretic mobilities have been shown by several groups to result from increased phosphorylation on serine residues within the region N-terminal to the kinase domain of Lck (6Luo K.

We therefore attempted to metabolically label cells with 32Pi to directly demonstrate that the mitosis-induced decreased mobility form of Lck contained elevated phosphoserine levels. These attempts were unsuccessful due to difficulties encountered in trying to manipulate mitotically arrested, nonadherent cells. Nevertheless, the above literature documenting the serine-dependent electrophoretic mobility shift of Lck, coupled with our observations, suggested that Lck was a substrate for a serine/threonine kinase that was specifically activated at mitosis. We investigated, therefore, whether that enzyme might be the cyclin-dependent kinase, Cdc2. To obtain Cdc2, lysates from LSTRA cells were incubated with agarose beads coupled to immobilized p13Suc1 (Suc1-agarose). The Suc1 protein binds with high affinity to selected cyclin-dependent protein kinases and is frequently used as an affinity ligand for Cdc2. The presence of Cdc2 on the Suc1-agarose was verified by both immunoblotting analyses with anti-Cdc2 antibodies and histone H1 kinase assays (data not shown). In addition to the phosphorylation of histone H1 during these assays, proteins bound to Suc1-agarose a"

The localization of this nonlysosomal pre-Golgi degradation to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) has been mostly deduced from kinetic studies and carbohydrate analyses, while direct evidence for degradation within the ER has been provided by in vitro reconstitution of this process. In this article, we took advantage of the transport incompetence of permeabilized cells to directly demonstrate that the selective degradation of secretory IgM (sIgM) in B lymphocytes is transport-dependent. We show that, upon permeabilization of the plasma membrane with either streptolysin O or digitonin, sIgM is not degraded unless transport is allowed. Nevertheless, upon complete reduction of interchain disulfide bonds with thiols, the free µ heavy chains are degraded by a transport-independent quality control mechanism within the ER. This latter degradation is nonselective to the secretory heavy chain µs, and the membrane heavy chain µm, which is normally displayed on the surface of the B cell, is also eliminated. Moreover, the degradation of free µs is no longer restricted to B lymphocytes, and it takes place also in the ER of plasma cells which normally secrete polymers of sIgM. Conversely, when assembled with the light chain, the degradation is selective to sIgM, is restricted to B lymphocytes, and is a transport-dependent post-ER event.

Secretory IgM (sIgM) is an oligomeric protein that is rapidly degraded in B lymphocytes but is efficiently secreted from plasma cells (24Sidman C. Cell. 1981; 23: 379-389Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 25Dulis B.H. Kloppel T.M. Grey H.M. Kubo R.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 4369-4374Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We have shown that, in the 38C B lymphocytes, sIgM degradation is also nonlysosomal and occurs prior to the trans-Golgi (26Amitay R. Bar-Nun S. Haimovich J. Rabinovich E. Shachar I. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 12568-12573Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 27Shachar I. Amitay R. Rabinovich E. Haimovich J. Bar-Nun S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 24241-24247Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, this degradation is selective to sIgM, while the membrane form of IgM (mIgM) is transported to the surface of 38C cells (26Amitay R. Bar-Nun S. Haimovich J. Rabinovich E. Shachar I. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 12568-12573Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 27Shachar I. Amitay R. Rabinovich E. Haimovich J. Bar-Nun S. J. Biol.

Chem. 1992; 267: 20694-20700Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Nevertheless, sIgM degradation does not comply with the postulated role of the quality control mechanism, since it is not the consequence but rather the cause for the incomplete assembly of sIgM. As we have shown in the 38C-derived D2 hybridoma, complete assembly of sIgM to polymers occurs in or beyond the trans-Golgi, while in the 38C B lymphocytes monomers are degraded prior to this compartment (27Shachar I. Amitay R. Rabinovich E. Haimovich J. Bar-Nun S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 24241-24247Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The localization of sIgM degradation further indicates that in the 38C cells this process does not represent the ER quality control. Degradation of sIgM requires ATP (27Shachar I. Amitay R. Rabinovich E. Haimovich J. Bar-Nun S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 24241-24247Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and displays a characteristic lag and a threshold temperature of 18°C (26Amitay R. Bar-Nun S. Haimovich J. Rabinovich E. Shachar I. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 12568-12573Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, unlike the pre-Golgi degradations described above, sIgM degradation is strongly inhibited by brefeldin A (BFA) (28Amitay R. Shachar I. Rabinovich E. Haimovich J. Bar-Nun S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 20694-20700Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, we have proposed a novel post-ER site for sIgM degradation, a mechanism in which export of sIgM from the ER is obligatory. The most direct evidence for ER degradation has been provided by in vitro reconstitution of this process. Permeabilized cells were used to identify the ER as the site of the quality control degradation of subunits of T cell receptor (16Stafford F.J. Bonifacino J.S. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 1225-1236Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) and asialoglycoprotein receptor (19Wikstrom L. Lodish H.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 5-8Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and the metabolically regulated degradation of HMG-CoA reductase (6Meigs T.E. Simoni R.D. J. Biol.

J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9166-9175Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We took advantage of the transport incompetence of cytosol-depleted permeabilized cells (30Rothman J.E. Orci L. Nature. 1992; 355: 409-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (739) Google Scholar, 31Rothman J.E. Nature. 1994; 372: 55-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (1992) Google Scholar) to directly demonstrate the transport dependence and hence the post-ER localization of sIgM degradation. Moreover, this in vitro system sheds light on the biochemical characterization of the complex process of protein degradation along the secretory pathway and on the interrelations between sIgM folding, assembly, and degradation. In this article we show that sIgM is not degraded in 38C B lymphocytes permeabilized with either streptolysin O (SLO) or digitonin. However, the post-ER µs-specific degradation is reconstituted if transport is allowed, and ER quality control degradation of free µ heavy chains is observed upon light chain dissociation by disulfide reduction with either dithiothreitol (DTT) or bis-(2-mercaptoethylsulfone) (BMS). This latter degradation is nonselective to free µs, and µm is also eliminated and is no longer restricted to B lymphocytes, and it takes place in the ER of D2 hybridoma as well. The murine B lymphocyte cell line 38C and the IgM-secreting D2 hybridoma derived from it were previously described (26Amitay R. Bar-Nun S. Haimovich J. Rabinovich E. Shachar I. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 12568-12573Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cells (1-2 × 107 cells/ml) were starved for 1 h in methionine-deficient RPMI medium, pulse-labeled for 5-30 min with either [35S]methionine or a mixture of [35S]methionine and [35S]cysteine (DuPont or Amersham Corp.) (50 µCi/ml; 1000 Ci/mmol) and chased by dilution in 4 volumes of RPMI containing 2 mM methionine. At the end of the pulse, or at various chase periods, cells and medium were separated, and cells were either lysed as described previously (26Amitay R. Bar-Nun S. Haimovich J. Rabinovich E. Shachar I. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 12568-12573Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), or permeabilized (see below). The level of [35S]methionine incorporation into de novo synthesized proteins was estimated as material precipitated by hot trichloroacetic acid. Addition of N-acetylleucylleucylnorleucinal (ALLN; 60 µg/ml; Calbiochem) was during the pulse and chase (28Amitay R. Shachar I. Rabinovich E. Haimovich J. Bar-Nun S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 20694-20700Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Additions of or BFA (5 µg/ml; Epicentre) (28Amitay R. Shachar I. Rabinovich E. Haimovich J. Bar-Nun S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 20694-20700Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), DTT (5 mM), BMS (Calbiochem), or β-mercaptoethanol (ME; 14.3 mM) were during the chase. At the end of the pulse labeling or at various chase periods, cells were permeabilized with either SLO or digitonin. For SLO permeabilization, cells were washed and resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline (4 × 107 38C cells/ml; 2 × 107 D2 cells/ml). SLO (Welcome), at 1.5 IU/ml for 38C cells and 0.4-0.6 IU/ml for D2 cells, was added and cells were incubated for 20 min on ice. The cells were collected by centrifugation (3,000 × g, 5 min, 4°C), resuspended in the same volume of fresh phosphate-buffered saline, further incubated for 10-15 min at 37°C and collected (3,000 × g, 5 min, 4°C) (adapted from Millere and Moore (32Miller S.G. Moore H.-P.H. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 112: 39-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar)). For digitonin permeabilization, cells were washed and resuspended (2 × 10 7 cells/ml) in KHM buffer (110 mM KOAc, 20 mM HEPES, 2 mM Mg2OAc (pH 7.2)). Digitonin (high purity, Calbiochem, 35 µg/ml) was added, and cells were incubated for 5 min on ice. Cells were diluted with 9 volumes, washed in ice-cold KHM, and collected (3,000 × g, 5 min, 4°C) (adapted from Plunter et al. (33Plunter H. Davidson H.W. Saraste J. Balch W.E. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 1097-1116Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar)). Optimal SLO and digitonin concentrations were determined to yield permeabilization of more than 95% of the cells, as judged by uptake of trypan blue and release of lactate dehydrogenase. This 135-kDa cytosolic enzyme was estimated by its activity measured spectrophotometrically as a decrease in A340 due to NADH oxidation (reaction mixture: 50 mM sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4), 1 mM NADH, 1% Triton X-100, 5 mM sodium pyruvate (modified from Tan et al. (34Tan A. Bolscher J. Feltkamp C. Ploegh H. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 116: 1357-1367Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar)). Permeabilized cells were resuspended in RPMI medium and chased in vitro by incubation at 37°C in a humid CO2-air incubator. Total IgM was immunoprecipitated from comparable amounts of trichloroacetic acid-precipitable 35S counts from lysates of whole or permeabilized cells and from culture supernatants. An excess amount of goat anti-mouse IgM (GAMIgM) antibodies was followed by sufficient protein A-bacterial adsorbent (Bio Makor) to immunoprecipitate all IgM. Immunoprecipitated IgM was eluted and incubated with or without endoglycosidase H (endo H; BioLabs) (26Amitay R. Bar-Nun S. Haimovich J. Rabinovich E. Shachar I. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 12568-12573Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). IgM was resolved by reducing or nonreducing SDS-PAGE and quantified by either laser (26Amitay R. Bar-Nun S. Haimovich J. Rabinovich E. Shachar I. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 12568-12573Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or Imaging Plate (Fuji) densitometry. IgM was electroblotted onto nitrocellulose, probed with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse µ antibodies (Sigma) (27Shachar I. Amitay R. Rabinovich E. Haimovich J. Bar-Nun S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 24241-24247Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and visualized by ECL (Amersham Corp.). The recently described nonlysosomal pre-Golgi degradation has been assigned to the ER as part of the quality control mechanism (4Klausner R.D. Sitia R. Cell. 1990; 62: 611-614Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar). Although sIgM degradation is also a nonlysosomal pre-trans-Golgi event, its localization prior to the polymerization and its inhibition by low temperatures, energy poisons, and BFA indicate that this process does not comply with quality control and occurs in a post-ER compartment (26Amitay R. Bar-Nun S. Haimovich J. Rabinovich E. Shachar I. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 12568-12573Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 27Shachar I. Amitay R. Rabinovich E. Haimovich J. Bar-Nun S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 24241-24247Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 28Amitay R. Shachar I. Rabinovich E. Haimovich J. Bar-Nun S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 20694-20700Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To characterize this degradation and directly demonstrate its novel localization, we have established an in vitro degradation assay in permeabilized cells. Since transport between the ER and the Golgi and between the Golgi cisternae requires a myriad of cytosolic factors and ATP, their depletion from permeabilized cells prevents any vesicular transport (30Rothman J.E. Orci L. Nature. 1992; 355: 409-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (739) Google Scholar, 31Rothman J.E. Nature. 1994; 372: 55-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (1992) Google Scholar). Consequently, proteins are trapped in the compartment they have reached prior to permeabilization. As shown in Fig. 1, when 38C cells were permeabilized immediately after the pulse labeling and incubated in vitro for up to 5 h, the levels of both µs and µm remained relatively constant with an estimated half-life of 90 h. Similar stability of IgM was observed in cells permeabilized by either SLO or digitonin (Fig. 1). Conversely, if prior to cell permeabilization intracellular transport was allowed in vivo for 90 min, a gradual loss of µs was observed, and about 50% of µs was eliminated during the subsequent 4 h of the in vitro incubation, reflecting the net degradation of µs with a half-life of 4.6 h (Fig. 1). This in vitro degradation was specific, since the level and pattern of total labeled proteins remained relatively constant (data not shown). Thus, even when newly synthesized sIgM is trapped in the ER of permeabilized 38C cells it is not degraded, indicating that this specific degradation of sIgM does not occur within the ER and requires transport to a post-ER compartment. Moreover, unlike the in vivo degradation which is inhibited by energy poisons (27Shachar I. Amitay R. Rabinovich E. Haimovich J. Bar-Nun S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 24241-24247Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), after arrival to the degradation site, the degradation process per se requires neither cytosolic components nor externally added ATP. Degradation of T cell receptor subunits in permeabilized cells was sensitive to the thiol redox state and was detected only in the presence of DTT (16Stafford F.J. Bonifacino J.S. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 1225-1236Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). This, together with studies with specific protease inhibitors (35Wileman T. Kane L.P. Terhorst C. Cell Regul. 1991; 2: 753-765Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), suggested the involvement of a cysteine protease in ER degradation. We have shown that a cysteine protease participates also in the in vivo degradation of sIgM in 38C cells (28Amitay R. Shachar I. Rabinovich E. Haimovich J. Bar-Nun S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 20694-20700Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It is possible that oxidizing thiol state unfavorable for the cysteine proteases activity was generated upon permeabilization. To asses the contribution of redox state, the thiol-reducing agents ME and DTT were added to the in vitro incubation. Interestingly, these two thiol-reducing agents exerted very different effects on the fate of newly synthesized µs and µm trapped in the ER. As shown in Fig. 1, in untreated as well as in ME-treated 38C cells permeabilized at the end of the pulse labeling, µ was essentially stable. Conversely, treatment with DTT caused a striking effect and within 5 h of in vitro incubation less than 10% of µ was recovered (Fig. 1). Regardless of whether cells were permeabilized by SLO or by digitonin, a rapid degradation of µ with a half-life shorter than 2 h was reconstituted in vitro in the presence of DTT (Fig. 1). Moreover, under these conditions, both µs and µm were rapidly degraded, as revealed after treatment with endo H (Fig. 1C). These results demonstrate two locally distinct degradations of µ chains which are both reconstituted in permeabilized cells but exhibit different thiol requirements. In the presence of DTT, µs and µm are degraded within the ER, as indicated by the persistence of this process in permeabilized cells. On the other hand, in the presence of ME or in the absence of any thiol-reducing agent, µs is degraded in a post-ER compartment, as concluded from the stability of µs in permeabilized cells (Fig. 1). Similar results were obtained with intact cells in which the ER-to-Golgi transport was blocked with BFA. As shown in Fig. 2A, in 38C cells incubated in the presence of DTT both µs and µm were rapidly degraded with a half-life of 1 h. The same short half-life was measured when DTT-treated cells were incubated in the presence of BFA, indicating degradation within the ER. Conversely, the rapid degradation (t1/2 = 1.5 h) of µ in untreated or ME-treated cells was inhibited by BFA (t1/2 = 4.4 h), thus this process took place in a post-ER compartment. Intrigued by the opposite effects exerted by DTT and ME, we examined a third thiol-reducing agent, BMS. As shown in Fig. 3A, the strong inhibition exerted by BFA (t1/2 was 3-fold prolonged, from 1.6 to 4.9 h) was moderated at a low (1 mM) BMS concentration (t1/2 was only 1.6-fold prolonged, from 2.3 h to 3.6 h), while at a higher (10 mM) BMS concentration, degradation was essentially insensitive to BFA (t1/2 was 1.1-fold prolonged, from 1.2 to 1.3 h). In this respect, BMS exerted both the effects of ME and DTT, in a dose-dependent fashion.Fig. 3Brefeldin A-insensitive and -sensitive degradations of IgM in intact 38C cells: effects of dose-dependent light chain dissociation exerted by BMS. 38C cells were pulse-labeled for 7 min with [35S]methionine, and chased for the indicated time (h) in the absence (−) or presence (+) of BFA (5 µg/ml), and in the absence (−) or presence of the indicated concentration of BMS (A and B). Unlabeled 38C cells were incubated for 1 h with the indicated concentration of BMS (C). Total IgM was immunoprecipitated by GAMIgM from cell lysates with equal amounts of protein and with similar amounts of trichloroacetic acid-precipitable material, treated with (A) or without (B and C) endo H and resolved by 10% SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions (A) or 3-12% SDS-PAGE under nonreducing conditions (B and C). Quantification by Imaging Plate densitometry (A and B) is presented as percent of µ at the end of the pulse labeling (A). Gels were electroblotted onto nitrocellulose and probed with peroxidase-anti-µ antibodies, and the peroxidase was visualized by ECL (C), as described under “Materials and Methods.” dg-µs, deglycosylated µs; dg-µm, deglycosylated µm; µ, µ heavy chains; µL, hemimers; µ2L2, monomers; arrow, unfolded µ.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We could not rule out the possibility that only the stronger divalent reducing agents DTT and BMS, but not the milder monovalent ME, activated a relevant ER cysteine protease. Indeed, based on the criteria that indicated the involvement of a cysteine protease in the post-ER degradation of sIgM (28Amitay R. Shachar I. Rabinovich E. Haimovich J. Bar-Nun S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 20694-20700Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), participation of a cysteine protease was demonstrated also in the ER degradation. As shown in Fig. 4, a strong inhibition was exerted by ALLN on the post-ER degradations, as well as on the DTT-dependent degradation within the ER. However, if the in vitro post-ER proteolytic activity shown in Fig. 1 was carried out by the same cysteine protease that was involved in the in vivo degradation, this enzyme did not require any exogenous thiols to function in vitro. In fact, in 38C cells permeabilized after 90 min of chase, the µs that reached the post-ER site was degraded most efficiently in the absence of any reducing agents (Fig. 1D). Conversely, in cells permeabilized at the end of the pulse labeling, degradation within the ER was completely dependent upon DTT (Fig. 1). It is well established that the thiol redox state plays a crucial role in the formation of intra- and intermolecular disulfide bonds (12Gething M.-J. Sambrook J. Nature. 1992; 355: 33-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (3563) Google Scholar, 13Helenius A. Marquardt T. Braakman I.

Therefore, an alternative explanation for the distinct effects of ME, DTT, and BMS on IgM degradation could be their differential capacity to generate diverse degradation substrates by interfering with IgM folding and assembly. This was shown by monitoring, by nonreducing SDS-PAGE, the effects of different concentrations of these thiols on the process of IgM assembly (Figs. 2B and 3B) and the levels of IgM assembly intermediates (Figs. 2C and 3C). A dose-dependent reduction of IgM revealed that the disulfide bond between µ and the light (L) chain in µL hemimers was reduced at 5 mM DTT (Fig. 2C) or 10 mM BMS (Fig. 3C) but hardly by ME (Fig. 2C), whereas 1 mM DTT (Fig. 2C) or BMS (Fig. 3C) was sufficient to fully reduce the µ-µ bond in µ2L2 monomers. The assembly process of newly synthesized µ with L into µL hemimers and subsequently into µ2L2 monomers (Figs. 2B and 3B) (see also Amitay et al. (26Amitay R. Bar-Nun S. Haimovich J. Rabinovich E. Shachar I. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 12568-12573Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)) was interrupted in 38C cells treated with 14.3 mM ME (Fig. 2B) or 1 mM BMS (Fig. 3B). Under these conditions, hemimers and free µ chains were observed during the entire chase, indicating that their subsequent assembly into monomers was inhibited, whereas the disulfide bond between µ and L in preexisting hemimers was relatively stable. On the other hand, in cells treated with 5 mM DTT (Fig. 2B) or 10 mM BMS (Fig. 3B), the majority of the µ chains were free, indicating their dissociation from the L chain. Moreover, these free µ chains exhibited a retarded electrophoretic mobility on nonreducing SDS-PAGE, suggesting that intrachain disulfide bonds were also reduced (38Braakman I. Helenius J. Helenius A. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 1717-1722Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). Although monomer formation was more prominent in SLO-permeabilized 38C cells, essentially similar effects of ME and DTT were observed in permeabilized or intact 38C cells (Fig. 2B). The higher level of monomers detected in permeabilized cells in the absence of any thiols could be caused either by SLO directly, by the 15-min incubation period at 37°C required for the SLO treatment, or by the relatively oxidizing conditions generated upon permeabilization. The two former possibilities were ruled out when higher levels of monomers were detected also in digitonin-permeabilized cells upon 5 min of incubation on ice (data not shown). Regardless of the permeabilization proc"

Despite an 6-8-fold decrease in overall binding affinity (Kapp = Kint×ω) at pH 8.1, 0.20 M NaCl, 20°C, the magnitude of the cooperativity parameter is at most 2-3-fold smaller than that of the wild-type protein. The magnitude of ω is independent of salt concentration and type over the range in [NaCl] from 0.125 to 0.225 M and [NaF] between 0.20 and 0.32 M (log ω = 2.86 ± 0.19). For comparison, log ω for wild-type gp32 is 2.91 (± 0.21) resolved at 0.275 M NaCl and 3.39 ± 0.11 in [NaF] between 0.40 and 0.45 M. In contrast to ω, the [NaCl] dependence of Kapp is large and markedly nonlinear for both wild-type and K3A gp32s over a [NaCl] range extending from 0.05 M to 0.40 M NaCl. Modeling of the complete salt dependence of Kapp for wild-type, K3A, and R4T gp32s in NaCl and NaF with a simple ion-exchange model suggests that substitutions within the basic Lys3-Arg4-Lys5 sequence do not strongly modulate the net displacement of cations and anions upon poly(A) complex formation by gp32.

The magnitude of ω is independent of salt concentration and type over the range in [NaCl] from 0.125 to 0.225 M and [NaF] between 0.20 and 0.32 M (log ω = 2.86 ± 0.19). For comparison, log ω for wild-type gp32 is 2.91 (± 0.21) resolved at 0.275 M NaCl and 3.39 ± 0.11 in [NaF] between 0.40 and 0.45 M. In contrast to ω, the [NaCl] dependence of Kapp is large and markedly nonlinear for both wild-type and K3A gp32s over a [NaCl] range extending from 0.05 M to 0.40 M NaCl. Modeling of the complete salt dependence of Kapp for wild-type, K3A, and R4T gp32s in NaCl and NaF with a simple ion-exchange model suggests that substitutions within the basic Lys3-Arg4-Lys5 sequence do not strongly modulate the net displacement of cations and anions upon poly(A) complex formation by gp32. Bacteriophage T4 gene 32 protein (gp32) 1The abbreviations used are: gp32T4 gene 32 proteinsssingle-strandedSSBsingle-strand binding proteindegdegree(s). is the paradigm for helix-destabilizing or single-stranded (ss) DNA-binding proteins, which play accessory roles in DNA replication, recombination, and repair (for a review see 1Karpel, R. L., Revzin, A., (eds) (1990) The Biology of Nonspecific DNA-Protein Interactions, pp. 103–130, CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL.Google Scholar). gp32 binds ss nucleic acids with an “unlimited” type of cooperativity to ssDNA segments transiently formed during these processes (2Lohman T.M. Bujalowski W. Overman L.B. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1988; 13: 250-255PubMed Google Scholar). Formation of clusters of gp32 monomers directly derives from the high cooperativity of binding and probably imparts on the ssDNA a particular conformation that is readily utilized by the DNA polymerase or recombinase as well as serving a protective role against the action of intracellular nucleases. In both DNA replication and recombination, it is also clear that apart from interactions with ssDNA, one or more gp32 monomers also engage in functional heterologous contacts with other proteins of the multienzyme complexes that carry out these processes (3Young M.C. Reddy M.K. von Hippel P.H. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 8675-8690Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 4Nossal N.G. FASEB J. 1992; 6: 871-878Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). T4 gene 32 protein single-stranded single-strand binding protein degree(s). Limited trypsinolysis experiments generally reveal that gene 32 protein (301 amino acids) contains three functional domains, which map to distinct regions of the primary structure (5Spicer E.K. Williams K.R. Konigsberg W.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 6433-6436Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Two terminal domains encompassing residues 1-21 (the N-terminal “B” or basic domain) and the C-terminal “A” or acidic domain (residues 254-301) are probably exposed to solvent and are structural appendages on the ssDNA-binding core domain (residues 22-253) (6Williams K.R. Konigsberg W. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 2463-2470Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The core domain binds an intrinsic Zn(II) ion (7Giedroc D.P. Keating K.M. Williams K.R. Konigsberg W.H. Coleman J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 8452-8456Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar) and contains major determinants for ss nucleic acid binding. The crystal structure of the core fragment complexed to oligo(dT)6 reveals that the ssDNA fits into a large cleft of a C-shaped molecule (8Shamoo Y. Friedman A.M. Parsons M.R. Konigsberg W.H. Steitz T.A. Nature. 1995; 376: 362-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). The cleft is lined with basic amino acids, in particular those derived from a Lys110-Arg111-Lys112 sequence (9Casas-Finet J.R. Fischer K.R. Karpel R.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 1050-1054Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), as well as aromatic amino acids (10Prigodich R.V. Shamoo Y. Williams K.R. Chase J.W. Konigsberg W.H. Coleman J.E. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 3666-3672Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The Zn(II) domain organizes one of the two globular domains of the molecule, which forms part of the ssDNA binding groove, as anticipated from spectroscopic and biochemical experiments (11Giedroc D.P. Khan R. Barnhart K. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 8230-8242Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 12Qiu H. Kodadek T. Giedroc D.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2773-2781Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It is well established that the A domain plays a functionally important role in heterologous protein-protein interactions, which are required for the formation of multiprotein complexes that carry out replication (4Nossal N.G. FASEB J. 1992; 6: 871-878Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 13Hurley J.M. Chervitz S.A. Jarvis T.C. Singer B.S. Gold L. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 229: 398-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) and recombination (14Jiang H. Giedroc D. Kodadek T. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 7904-7911Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15Salinas F. Kodadek T. Cell. 1995; 82: 111-119Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Cooperative binding contributes up to 40% of the binding energy of the gp32 monomer at equilibrium under physiological salt concentrations; however, there exists no information available that addresses the extent to which cooperative binding is required for gp32 function in DNA metabolism. We have initiated a program to determine how the N-terminal domain modulates the mode and mechanism of gp32 binding on model ss nucleic acid substrates. Our approach is to generate a series of N-terminal domain point mutants of gp32 with well defined thermodynamic and kinetic defects, which could then be used as tools to probe the function of the N-terminal domain in vivo and in in vitro replication and recombination assays. The simplified view of the three-domain model of gp32 has the “B”-domain participating in contiguous monomer-monomer interactions on the ssDNA, while the gp32 monomer-ssDNA interface is functionally and physically separate (16Newport J.W. Lonberg N. Kowalczykowski S.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1981; 145: 105-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). In a previous report, we determined that Arg4 in the Lys3-Arg4-Lys5 sequence plays a critical role in maintaining high affinity and highly cooperative binding to ss nucleic acids (17Villemain J.L. Giedroc D.P. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 11235-11246Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) in a manner strongly dependent on the nature of the substitution of Arg4. As a result, point mutants with Kapp reduced as little as 2-1000-fold were characterized. In particular, quantitative investigation of moderately defective gp32s allowed us to conclude that this model is an oversimplification, since these mutants retain a high cooperativity of binding (ω) even in the presence of large 10-100-fold decrements in the overall binding constant (Kapp = Kint×ω) (17Villemain J.L. Giedroc D.P. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 11235-11246Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). This suggested that the N-terminal domain controls the magnitude and energetics of both ω and Kint terms. Although the recent crystallographic structure of the core fragment complexed with a ssDNA oligonucleotide (8Shamoo Y. Friedman A.M. Parsons M.R. Konigsberg W.H. Steitz T.A. Nature. 1995; 376: 362-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar) does not include the B-domain, the proximity of the N-terminal residue (Gly22) of the core fragment to the ssDNA cleft provides structural support for the suggestion that the N-terminal domain and ssDNA cleft cooperate to enable gp32 to form tightly and cooperatively bound clusters of monomers at equilibrium. In this report, we extend these findings to Lys3 with our characterization of the binding of K3A gene 32 protein on the model ribohomopolymer poly(A) under solution conditions previously used to characterize wild-type gp32 and a number of Arg4 substitution mutants of gp32 (17Villemain J.L. Giedroc D.P. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 11235-11246Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). We show that this mutant behaves quantitatively like R4Q gp32 (17Villemain J.L. Giedroc D.P. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 11235-11246Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) and retains a high cooperativity of binding at equilibrium largely indistinguishable from the wild-type protein. Given the widely disparate nature of the K3A and R4Q substitutions, the data presented here provide crucial support for the contention that the N-terminal B-domain substitutions of gp32 truly reflect a perturbation of the wild-type protein rather than reporting on new or novel properties acquired by the mutant proteins. More importantly, these data provide the equilibrium basis for an interpretation of the stopped-flow fluorescence dissociation kinetic behavior and biochemical function of gp32s described elsewhere. 2J. L. Villemain and D. P. Giedroc, (1996) Biochemistry, in press. 3J. L. Villemain, S. Morrical, and D. P. Giedroc, manuscript in preparation. All buffers were prepared with doubly distilled Milli-Q water. Buffer salts were obtained from Sigma. Poly(A) obtained from Midland Certified Reagent Co. (Midland, TX) was fractionated on Sepharose S-200 (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.), and the first 30% of the fractions containing absorbance were collected and dialyzed exhaustively against T/0.10 M NaCl. The concentration of poly(A) nucleotides was determined from duplicate dilutions in the samebuffer using ϵ = 10,300 M (nucleotide)−1· cm−1 at 260 nm (18Kowalczykowski S.C. Lonberg N. Newport J.W. von Hippel P.H. J. Mol. Biol. 1981; 145: 75-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). The fractionated poly(A) was polydisperse and migrated roughly along side a ≈500-base pair duplex DNA fragment on a 1% agarose gel. Other fractionations are described in the text. K3A gene 32 protein was prepared from an overproducing plasmid harboring the K3A gene 32 coding sequences under the transcriptional control of the inducible λPL promoter exactly as described previously (17Villemain J.L. Giedroc D.P. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 11235-11246Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The details of the degenerate oligonucleotide cassette-based mutagenesis approach used to construct the expression plasmid are essentially as outlined (17Villemain J.L. Giedroc D.P. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 11235-11246Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Briefly, an NdeI-SacI double-stranded cassette, which would direct a random set of mutations at Lys3, was synthesized with 25% A, G, T, and C in the first two positions and 50% G+C in the third position of the Lys3 codon in the sense strand. Three inosine residues were inserted in the nonsense strand (19Knight K.L. Sauer R.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 13706-13710Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Following ligation into NdeI/SacI-digested pT7gp32.wt and bacterial (Escherichia coli TB1) transformation, transformants were selected, double-stranded miniprep DNA prepared and subjected to DNA sequencing using the dideoxy method in order to identify the mutation at codon 3 (Ala = CGC). The mutant gene containing upstream translational regulatory signals was subcloned into the pPL expression plasmid pTL9W to create pPLΦg32.K3A for protein expression (17Villemain J.L. Giedroc D.P. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 11235-11246Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Wild-type and R4T gp32s were purified as described (17Villemain J.L. Giedroc D.P. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 11235-11246Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). T buffer is 0.01 M Tris-HCl, 0.1 mM Na3EDTA, pH 8.1, at 20°C. To make the buffers for binding measurements, a 10-fold stock solution of T buffer was mixed with the appropriate amount of 3.94 M NaCl and volume made up with doubly distilled water. The stock NaCl concentration was determined by refractive index. The conductivity of all buffer solutions was also determined at ambient temperature to ensure their relative consistency of [NaCl]. The fluorescence of K3A gp32 was monitored with an SLM 8000 spectrofluorimeter by excitation at 292 nm or 296 nm (excitation bandpass = 2 nm) and emission at 347 nm (bandpass = 4 nm). The temperature was maintained with a thermostatted sample compartment at 20 ± 0.1°C. Protein samples, prepared at the indicated concentrations in 2.0 ml of buffer, were continuously stirred gently throughout the course of titration with small (2-5 µl) aliquots of a concentrated stock solution of polynucleotide added. The measured fluorescence values (Fi) were converted to corrected fluorescence values (Fcorr,i) after accounting for dilution, inner filter correction (20Giedroc D.P. Khan R. Barnhart K. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 11444-11455Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and photobleaching as described (17Villemain J.L. Giedroc D.P. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 11235-11246Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The extent of photobleaching was always less than 5% under the excitation conditions used. Qobs is given by Qobs = (Fcorr,max− Fcorr,i)/Fcorr,max. We determined that the binding density obtained from the degree of quenching, νQ = (LB/DT) where DT = [poly(A)]T, directly reflects the true binding density, ν, using a general method of analysis (21Bujalowski W. Lohman T.M. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 3099-3106Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar) (data not shown) (17Villemain J.L. Giedroc D.P. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 11235-11246Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Individual titrations were subjected to a nonlinear least-squares minimization using the algorithm JANA (17Villemain J.L. Giedroc D.P. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 11235-11246Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) linked to NONLIN (24Johnson M.L. Faunt L.M. Methods Enzymol. 1992; 210: 1-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar) running on a PC486 platform to extract values of Kint and ω with n fixed at 7.5 from the McGhee-von Hippel closed-form expression for the cooperative large-ligand overlap binding model (22McGhee J.D. von Hippel P.H. J. Mol. Biol. 1974; 86: 469-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (2717) Google Scholar, 23Bujalowski W. Lohman T.M. Anderson C.F. Biopolymers. 1989; 28: 1637-1643Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), where R = {[1 − (n + 1)νQ]2+ 4ωνQ(1 − nνQ)}1/2. Qobs /Qmax=LB/LT(Eq. 1) νQ=Qobs/QmaxLT/DT(Eq. 2) LF=1−Qobs/QmaxLT(Eq. 3) νQ/Lp=Kint1−nvQ{2ω1−nvQ(2ω−1)1−nvQ+νQ+R]n−1×1−(n+1)vQ+R/21−nvQ2(Eq. 4) LB determined from Equation 1, LT, and DT were used as input into JANA to solve for LB numerically at iteratively adjusted Kint and ω such that the sum of the residuals between calculated and measured LB is minimized (24Johnson M.L. Faunt L.M. Methods Enzymol. 1992; 210: 1-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). The results of fitting individual titrations are reported with only those data points where ν≤ 0.011 used in any analysis, unless otherwise noted (17Villemain J.L. Giedroc D.P. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 11235-11246Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Values of Kint and ω are returned by NONLIN with 67% confidence intervals, which incorporate the high negative cross-correlation coefficient (−0.99) between these two parameters calculated by NONLIN. The validity of the returned parameters and associated confidence intervals was routinely assessed visually by superimposing the experimental data with three theoretical isotherms: one described by the minimized parameters, one calculated with the upper confidence limit of Kint and the lower limit of ω, and a third calculated with the lower limit of Kint and the upper limit of ω. Salt-back-induced dissociation titrations of gp32-poly(A) complexes were carried out and analyzed with ω fixed at 1000 as described (17Villemain J.L. Giedroc D.P. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 11235-11246Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 20Giedroc D.P. Khan R. Barnhart K. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 11444-11455Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 25Overman L.B. Bujalowski W. Lohman T.M. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 456-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). The decrease in the positive Cotton band of poly(A) at 264 nm was monitored upon titration with small aliquots of gp32 protein on a Jasco C-600 spectropolarimeter. About 15-25 µM poly(A) in 1700 µl of T buffer with an indicated concentration of NaCl was incubated at 20°C for 5 min before data acquisition. Typical acquisition parameters were a 1-2-s time constant, a 1-nm bandwidth, a 0.2-nm step size, and a sensitivity of 20 mdeg. Six scans in a window of 262-266 nm were averaged to increase the signal-to-noise ratio. After each addition of gp32, the cuvette was stirred for 1 min at which point stirring was ceased and the CD spectrum recorded. The aromatic CD contribution from gp32 was subtracted from the spectrum, which was then corrected for dilution. The resulting CD intensity at 264 nm was used for the calculation of fractional saturation, Θ. Fractional saturation for a gp32 addition point was calculated from Θ = (mdegi− mdeginit)/(mdegfinal− mdeginit), which assumes that a change in the CD intensity at 264 nm is proportional to the protein binding density. The data were then subjected to the same nonlinear least squares analysis as above, except that n = 10 nucleotides (determined independently at low salt) and data points at Θ≤ 0.40 were used in the analysis. The interaction of gp32 with poly(A) was monitored by measuring the decrease in the intrinsic protein (Trp) fluorescence that occurs upon RNA binding. Titrations were carried out in the “reverse” mode in which a fixed input concentration of ligand gp32 (LT) is titrated with lattice poly(A). All measurements unless otherwise noted were carried out at pH 8.1 in 10 mM Tris-HCl, 0.1 mM Na3EDTA (T buffer) with the indicated concentration of NaCl at 20°C. Independent determination of the apparent site size (n), the number of occluded nucleotides per gp32 monomer, was carried out under low salt conditions (T/0.05 M NaCl). Like found for wild-type gp32 and other B-domain mutants (17Villemain J.L. Giedroc D.P. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 11235-11246Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), K3A gp32 was shown to bind stoichiometrically with n = 7.5 (± 0.5) nucleotides (1Karpel, R. L., Revzin, A., (eds) (1990) The Biology of Nonspecific DNA-Protein Interactions, pp. 103–130, CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL.Google Scholar, 5Spicer E.K. Williams K.R. Konigsberg W.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 6433-6436Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The maximal extent of quenching of the Trp fluorescence (Qmax) of K3A gp32 was determined to be 0.30 (± 0.01) comparable to the value (0.29) determined for wild-type gp32. In order to determine how substitution of Lys3 with Ala affects the binding properties of gp32, resolution of Kint and ω according to McGhee-von Hippel linear lattice theory (22McGhee J.D. von Hippel P.H. J. Mol. Biol. 1974; 86: 469-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (2717) Google Scholar) is required. This can only be done under nonstoichiometric binding conditions. Solution conditions were therefore identified for K3A gp32 under which nonstoichiometric binding could be readily detected in reverse titrations using methods exactly as described previously (17Villemain J.L. Giedroc D.P. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 11235-11246Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). In initial experiments carried out in T buffer/0.275 M NaCl, pH 8.1, and 20°C under which wild-type gp32 binding could be readily measured, K3A gp32 was found not to bind to an appreciable extent, signaling a significantly lower binding affinity. T/0.125 M NaCl, pH 8.1, was subsequently identified as solution conditions that could be used to resolve Kint from ω. Fig. 1 shows a set of representative binding isotherms obtained for K3A gp32 with the initial input ligand concentration, [LT], ranging from 1.1 to 3.0 × 10−7M, conditions under which the wild-type protein shows little or no ligand aggregation (20Giedroc D.P. Khan R. Barnhart K. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 11444-11455Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 26Carroll R.B. Neet K. Goldthwait D.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1975; 91: 275-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The multiple titrations spanned overlapping ranges of binding density (ν) or polynucleotide lattice saturation (Θ) (indicated in the legend to Fig. 1). To minimize any lattice end effects, only those data points where ν≤ 0.011 (or Θ≤ 0.083) were considered in an analysis, thus removing points at the beginning of some reverse titrations at higher [LT] (open symbols in Fig. 1). The range in values of Kint and ω obtained from a nonlinear least squares parameter optimization of individual titrations, some of which are shown in Fig. 1 as best-fit theoretical isotherms superimposed on the data. As can be seen, the apparent maximal extent of quenching in each isotherm appears to increase with increasing imput ligand concentration but consistently remains far smaller than Qmax (Qmax = 0.30). This is behavior diagnostic of highly cooperative ligand binding (27Kowalczykowski S.C. Paul L.S. Lonberg N. Newport J.W. McSwiggen J.A. von Hippel P.H. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 1226-1240Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). This is borne out by the quantitative analysis. The continuous curve through each set of the data points represents the function described by the optimized parameters (Kint and ω) with n fixed at 7.5 nucleotides. Kapp was found to be 6.7 (± 2.0) × 106M−1 with the resolved values of ω ranging from 430 to 1850 and Kint ranging from 0.5 to 1.1 × 104M−1. Fig. 2 presents the results of multiple independent determinations of ω made from additional reverse titrations like those shown in Fig. 1 carried out over a wide range of [NaCl] (closed symbols) and [NaF] (open symbols) at 20°C, pH 8.1, accessible using this technique. Two important points can be made from these data. Although it was not possible to resolve Kint and ω from one another for the wild-type and K3A gp32s in overlapping solution conditions given their very different binding affinities, ω for both gp32s does not show a consistent dependence on [NaX]. The average value of log ω for K3A gp32 is 2.86 (± 0.19) or ω≈ 725. For wild-type gp32, log ω = 2.91 (± 0.21) resolved at 0.275 M NaCl (17Villemain J.L. Giedroc D.P. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 11235-11246Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), while between 0.40 and 0.45 M NaF, log ω = 3.39 (± 0.11) or ω≈ 2400, or no more than 3-fold larger than ω for K3A gp32. These data suggest that the magnitude of ω is more similar than different from wild-type gp32 (17Villemain J.L. Giedroc D.P. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 11235-11246Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), although the finite and polydisperse length of the poly(A) used to make these measurements places limitations on the maximum magnitude of ω accessible in these experiments. As an illustration of this, ω was determined for K3A gp32 using three different pools of poly(A) obtained from a fractionation of commercially available poly(A) on a Sephacryl S-200 column. A broad peak of absorptivity was obtained. Pool I was obtained from the very tip of the peak (first 5% of the fractions containing absorbance), pool II represented the next ≈15% of the peak, while pool III represented approximately the next 25% of the peak. ω values resolved from reverse titrations in 0.20 M NaF using each of these pools are shown in Fig. 2 as the data points labeled I, II, and III. As can be seen, log ω for the longest poly(A) fraction (pool I) is at the high end of the range obtained for K3A gp32 (ω≈ 1500), while pool III underestimates the true cooperativity of binding (ω≈ 350). To minimize the impact of polydisperse and finite-length poly(A), the quantitative analysis of all reverse titrations was limited to data points obtained at a fractional saturation of the nucleic acid by gp32 to 10% or less (θ≤ 0.10 or ν≤ 0.013). gp32 cluster size simulations (27Kowalczykowski S.C. Paul L.S. Lonberg N. Newport J.W. McSwiggen J.A. von Hippel P.H. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 1226-1240Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar) reveal that, at this extent of cooperativity and fractional saturation, it is unlikely that greater than 5-10% of the gp32 clusters would exceed the length of the lattice (simulations not shown). All of the experiments reported here were carried out with a poly(A) pool identical or comparable to pool II. With a highly cooperatively binding ligand, reverse fluorescence quenching titrations can only be used to estimate Kapp and accurately resolve Kint from ω over a fairly narrow range of Kapp (≈106 to 107M−1) (27Kowalczykowski S.C. Paul L.S. Lonberg N. Newport J.W. McSwiggen J.A. von Hippel P.H. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 1226-1240Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Depending on the salt dependence of Kapp, this can also severely limit to what degree the solution conditions can be varied to probe the effect of solution variables on the interaction. To extend the usable range in solution conditions, in particular, salt concentration, which can be used to measure the binding properties of K3A gp32, independent determinations of Kint and ω were made for wild-type and K3A gp32s from “forward” titrations of poly(A) with gp32 using circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy (28Khan R. Giedroc D.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 6689-6695Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Fig. 3 shows a set of representative forward titrations carried out at various [NaCl] from 0.30 to 0.375 M. Due again to the fact that the McGhee-von Hippel model assumes an infinite-length nucleic acid, we confined the quantitative analysis to data points where θ≤ 0.40 as a compromise value. Binding parameters found for the wild-type and K3A gp32 compared to other Arg4 substitution mutants (17Villemain J.L. Giedroc D.P.

We have investigated the functional role of Arg-210, the conserved arginine in site A of murine type Iα R subunit, by analyzing the effects of nine different substitutions at this residue on cAMP binding and allosteric properties of bacterially expressed RIα subunits. All substitutions reduced the cAMP binding affinity of site A, but the magnitude of reduction varied from several hundredfold to 106-fold. The differential effects of the different substitutions could not easily be rationalized by interactions with cAMP and might, in part, reflect interactions with other residues in the unoccupied cAMP-binding pocket. None of the Arg-210 substitutions appeared to disrupt the allosteric interaction by which occupation of site A slows dissociation of cAMP from site B, although the effect was difficult to elicit in full with mutations that had strong effects on cAMP binding. The two weakest substitutions, Arg-210 → Ile and Arg-210 → Thr, could be shown to have essentially no effect on the allosteric interaction by which occupation of site A reduces the affinity of R subunit for the catalytic subunit. The weaker mutations had a smaller effect on kinase activation by the suboptimal activator Rp-adenosine cyclic 3′,5′-phosphorothioate than by cAMP, suggesting that the analog largely bypasses interactions with the guanidinium group of Arg-210.

A recent crystal structure of a large fragment containing the cAMP-binding domains of R subunit corroborated predictions of an earlier model based on the structure of the catabolite activator protein of Escherichia coli that most of the important contact residues for interaction with the ribose-cyclic phosphate of cAMP are in β-strands 6 and 7 of an antiparallel β-roll structure forming one face of the cAMP-binding pockets (5Su Y.

Rp-phosphorothioate (Rp-cAMPS) and dithioate analogs of cAMP have been described as antagonists of wild-type kinase (12De Wit R.J.W. Hekstra D. Jastorff B. Stec W.J. Baraniak J. Van Driel R.

Hoppe J. Stec W.J. Baraniak J. Jastorff B. Eur. J. Biochem. 1982; 122: 95-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 16O'Brian C.A. Roczniak S.O. Bramson H.N. Baraniak J. Stec W.J. Kaiser E.T. Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 4371-4376Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), and this view was reinforced by a more recent report showing that Rp-cAMPS activates wild-type kinase in the absence of ATP or enzymes with mutant R subunits (Arg-210 → Lys or Ala-98 → Ser) in the presence of ATP (17Dostmann W.R.G. Taylor S.S. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 8710-8716Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The apparent importance of the equatorial exocyclic oxygen of cAMP (missing in Rp-cAMPS) for full kinase activation led to the suggestion that interaction between this oxygen and a positively charged amino acid side chain was responsible for the cAMP-dependent conformational change in the R subunit underlying the C subunit release (15De Wit R.J.W. Hoppe J. Stec W.J. Baraniak J. Jastorff B. Eur. J. Biochem. 1982; 122: 95-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). From the structure of the cAMP-binding sites, this side chain would have to come from Arg-210 in site A or Arg-334 in site B (5Su Y. Dostmann W.R.G. Herberg F.W. Durick K. Xuong N-h. Ten Eyck L. Taylor S.S. Varughese K.I. Science. 1995; 269: 807-813Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar). To better evaluate the role of Arg-210 in cAMP binding and allosteric functions of site A, we introduced a variety of amino acid substitutions at this site in bacterially expressed recombinant murine RIα subunit. Ile-210, Ser-210, and Thr-210 mutations had been identified as spontaneous or mutagen-induced substitutions found in “Ka” mutant isolates of S49 mouse lymphoma cells (19Gorman K.B. Steinberg R.A. Somatic Cell Mol. Genet. 1994; 20: 301-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) and were transferred from mutant cDNAs to the bacterial expression plasmid. Asn, Asp, Gln, Glu, His, and Lys substitutions were generated by site-directed mutagenesis to assess the role of ionic and/or hydrogen-bonding interactions in the functions of Arg-210. Although the mutations all reduced the binding affinity of site A, the affinities of the mutant sites varied over a range of more than 1,000-fold. Using R subunits with the mutations that least affected cAMP binding, we found that the guanidinium group of Arg-210 is unnecessary for either the allosteric effect of cyclic nucleotide binding that couples the kinetic properties of site B with occupation of site A or the allosteric coupling by which occupation of site A decreases the affinity of R for C subunit. [2,8-3H]cAMP (30 Ci/mmol), [γ-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol), and Aquassure scintillation mixture were from DuPont NEN; the phosphate acceptor heptapeptide Leu-Arg-Arg-Ala-Ser-Leu-Gly (Kemptide) was synthesized and high performance liquid chromatography-purified by the Molecular Biology Resource Facility of the University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center; N6-benzoyl-cAMP (Bz-cAMP), cGMP, ATP, MOPS, and bis-tris propane were from Sigma; Rp-cAMPS was from BioLog Life Sciences Institute; and ultrapure urea and ammonium sulfate were from ICN Pharmaceuticals, Inc. The Rp-cAMPS was purified further by high performance liquid chromatography on a reverse-phase C-18 column loaded in 20 mM triethylamine formate (pH 6.7) and eluted with 4% acetonitrile in this buffer. Stock solutions were checked for purity by high performance liquid chromatography and found to contain less than 0.1% contaminating cAMP when used in kinase activation experiments. The mutagenic oligonucleotide described below was synthesized by the Molecular Biology Resource Facility of the University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center. Other chemicals were reagent grade or better and used without further purification. “EB” contained 10 mM Tris-hydrochloride (pH 7.5), 10 mM 2-mercaptoethanol, and 0.1 mM EDTA. “Urea solution” was prepared freshly before use and consisted of 8 M urea in 10 mM Tris-hydrochloride (pH 7.5), 50 mM 2-mercaptoethanol, and 25 mML-lysine. “R subunit storage buffer” was 100 mM Tris acetate (pH 7.5), 150 mM sodium chloride, 50 mM 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.1 mM EDTA, and 50% w/v glycerol. “Hepes buffer” contained 15 mM Hepes, pH 7.0, 5 mM EDTA, 0.3 mM EGTA, and 0.5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin. “Reconstitution buffer” contained 50 mM bis-tris propane (pH 7.0), 150 mM sodium chloride, 10 mM magnesium sulfate, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 0.1 mM EDTA, and 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin. Full-length nonfusion constructs for bacterial expression of murine Cα and RIα subunits were made in the T7 promoter-containing vector pET-8c (or, for the R subunit plasmid, a variant lacking an EcoRI restriction site) as described previously (20Steinberg R.A.

Biol. 1993; 13: 2332-2341Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Glu-200, Ile-210, Ser-210, Thr-210, and Asp-324 mutations were introduced into the wild-type R subunit plasmid by cassette replacement using polymerase chain reaction-amplified cDNAs from S49 cell mutants (19Gorman K.B. Steinberg R.A. Somatic Cell Mol. Genet. 1994; 20: 301-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Asn-210, Asp-210, Gln-210, Glu-210, His-210, and Lys-210 mutations were generated by site-directed mutagenesis using the following degenerate oligonucleotide primer in a polymerase chain reaction-based mutagenesis protocol (22Steinberg R.A.

Selected mutations at position 210 were combined with the Asp-324 mutation by exchange of an EcoRI-MluI restriction fragment between appropriate plasmids. The sequences of kinase subunit genes in all plasmid constructs were verified by direct sequencing using a Sequenase II kit (U. S. Biochemical Corp.). R and C subunits were expressed in E. coli BL21(DE3) and purified to near homogeneity as described previously (11Symcox M.M. Cauthron R.D. Øgreid D. Steinberg R.A. J. Biol.

R subunits were rendered cAMP-free by gel filtration in urea solution followed by dialysis against R subunit storage buffer as described previously (11Symcox M.M. Cauthron R.D. Øgreid D. Steinberg R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23025-23031Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For studies of fluorescence quenching, R subunits were purified further by affinity chromatography on N6-aminoethyl-cAMP-Sepharose (23Dills Jr., W.L. Beavo J.A. Bechtel P.J. Krebs E.G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1975; 62: 70-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Samples were loaded in EB; the columns were washed successively with EB, EB plus 1 M sodium chloride, and EB; the R subunits were eluted with urea solution; and the purified subunits were renatured by dialysis against R subunit storage buffer. R subunits were diluted to 0.2-0.4 µM in dissociation buffer without bovine serum albumin but with 10% w/v redistilled glycerol. Fluorescence measurements were made at 20°C with an SLM-Aminco model 4800 Spectrofluorometer using 0.4-cm quartz cuvettes. Samples were excited either at 293 or 300 nm to minimize absorbance of cAMP, and equivalent results were observed for those R subunits tested at both excitation wavelengths. Emission intensities were monitored through Schott WG-345 and Corning 7-54 filters. For titrations, cAMP was increased incrementally by additions of small volumes of stock cAMP solutions, and intensities were corrected for dilution of R subunit. (Final volumes of samples were less than 10% greater than initial volumes.) Assay of Dissociation or Exchange of [3H]cAMP—For studies of the effect of cyclic nucleotide concentrations on site B off-rates, R subunits at about 20 nM in Hepes buffer were incubated with 30 nM [3H]cAMP for 2 h at 30°C and then diluted 30-fold into Hepes buffer containing 150 mM or 3.2 M sodium chloride and unlabeled cAMP, cGMP, or Bz-cAMP to give concentrations indicated in Fig. 3, Fig. 4. Samples taken after various intervals of incubation at 30°C were precipitated with ammonium sulfate and filtered to determine bound radioactivity as described by Døskeland and Øgreid (24Døskeland S.O.

For the subunit reassociation experiments of Fig. 5, Fig. 6, 10 µl each of R and C subunits at three times their final concentrations were mixed in reconstitution buffer containing ATP (as the magnesium salt) at the concentrations to be used in subsequent kinase assays (30 µM for Fig. 5 and 0.2 mM for Figs. 2, 6, and 7). For the experiments of Fig. 2, Fig. 3, Fig. 4, Fig. 5, Fig. 6, Fig. 7, R and C subunits were reconstituted in a similar manner at 50 times their final concentration and then diluted to three times the final concentration immediately before use. After preincubations as described in figure legends, either 10 or 20 µl of reconstituted subunits were mixed with reconstitution buffer containing 0.5 µCi of [γ-32P]ATP at the same ATP concentration as in the reconstitutions and Kemptide to give a final concentration of 0.2 mM for the experiments of Figs. 2, 6, and 7 and 0.1 mM for that of Fig. 5. For the activation experiments of Fig. 2, Fig. 3, Fig. 4, Fig. 5, Fig. 6, Fig. 7, cAMP or cAMP analogs were included in the labeling mixture to give the final concentrations indicated. 30-µl reaction volumes were incubated at 30°C, and samples were stopped and processed as for the standard kinase assay (above). In the experiment of Fig. 7, 50 mM MOPS (pH 7.0) was used as the buffer in place of bis-tris propane.Fig. 6The effect of Ile-210 and Thr-210 mutations on the cyclic nucleotide-mediated reduction in affinity of R for C subunit.

Fig. 1 shows the results from an alternative assay based on the finding that cAMP-dependent quenching of the endogenous Trp fluorescence of R subunit results solely from the interaction of cAMP with site A (11Symcox M.M.

Physiol. 1995; 165: 376-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). The R subunit concentrations (0.2-0.4 µM) were apparently near or above the dissociation constants (Kd values) for cAMP binding to site A of the Ile-210 and Thr-210 mutants, but, for the other R subunit preparations, the Trp fluorescence quenching could be titrated with increasing concentrations of cAMP to yield apparent Kd values. In terms of relative effects on site A affinity, the mutations could be ordered as follows: (Thr, Ile) < Lys < Asn < His ≅ Ser < Asp < Gln < Glu. Apparent Kd values ranged from about 0.6 µM for the Lys-210 mutant R subunit to 1 mM for the Glu-210 mutant R subunit. Fits of the data of Fig. 1 with a cooperative binding model suggested Hill coefficients of about 1.3 for most of the mutants. Despite numerous attempts to determine site A affinities for the Ile-210 and Thr-210 mutants by [3H]cAMP-binding assays, we were ultimately unsuccessful. The rapid off-rates of the mutant sites compromised retention of labeled nucleotide in the standard filter-binding assay, and data from equilibrium dialysis experiments were ambiguous at best. 3M. M. Symcox and R. A. Steinberg, unpublished observations. In attempts to estimate more accurately the effects of the Ile-210 and Thr-210 mutations on site A binding, we combined the position 210 mutations with a Gly-324 → Asp mutation, which inactivates site B (10Steinberg R.A.

Fig. 2A compares the effects of the Ile-210/Asp-324 and Lys-210/Asp-324 mutations with that of the Asp-324 mutation alone on activation by Bz-cAMP. For this experiment, we used relatively low concentrations of R and C subunits to facilitate activation of enzyme with the Lys-210 mutation, and the effect of the Lys-210 mutation on apparent activation constant (Ka) was about 20 times greater than that of the Ile-210 mutation. Fig. 2B shows that the effects of the Ile-210 and Thr-210 mutations on apparent Ka values were about the same. For this experiment the ratio of R to C subunits was raised to assure complete reconstitution. Under the conditions of Fig. 2, both A and B, the Ile-210 mutation caused an increase of about 100-fold in apparent Ka when compared to the effect of the Asp-324 mutation alone. Equilibrium dialysis experiments with the Ile-210/Asp-324 and Thr-210/Asp-324 double mutant R subunits yielded Kd values for [3H]cAMP that were on the order of about 0.5 to 1 µM, but the conditions for these experiments (overnight at 4°C) were different from those used for fluorescence quenching, and we were unable to achieve saturation with the Lys-210/Asp-324 mutant R subunit for comparison.3 Furthermore, we suspect that the site B mutation causes a decrease of about 4-fold in site A affinity based both on our previous data comparing the cAMP binding of wild-type and Asp-324 mutant R subunits (11Symcox M.M. Cauthron R.D. Øgreid D. Steinberg R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23025-23031Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and on the observation that the Ile-210/Asp-324 double mutant R subunit gave an apparent Kd of 0.3 µM by tryptophan fluorescence quenching.3 Taken together, all of our data are consistent with the Ile-210 and Thr-210 mutations having about an order of magnitude less effect on cAMP-binding affinity than the Lys-210 mutation. Fig. 3, Fig. 4 present evidence that mutant R subunits with substitutions at Arg-210 retain the allosteric interaction by which occupation of site A retards dissociation of cAMP from site B (9Houge G. Steinberg R.A. Øgreid D. Døskeland S.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 19507-19516Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Fig. 3 shows results of experiments in which cAMP concentrations were varied in low (Fig. 1A) and high salt (Fig. 1B) to titrate the effect of site A on dissociation of prebound [3H]cAMP from site B. All of the mutant preparations exhibited a cAMP-dependent slowing of site B dissociation, and this suggested that the mutant A sites were able to couple allosterically with intrachain B sites. In terms of dose-response behavior, the apparent order of the various mutations was consistent with the data of Fig. 1, Fig. 2, with Thr-210 and Ile-210 the weakest, Gln-210 and Glu-210 strongest, and the remainder more or less bunched in between. The dose-response curves in low salt were steeper than those in high salt. (Shallower titration curves were also observed when Trp quenching was assayed in high salt (data not shown).) High salt shifted the dose-response curves to the right by varying amounts, but the slower dissociation of [3H]cAMP from site B in high salt made it easier to detect unambiguously the effects of high cAMP on site B dissociation from R subunits with the strongest (Gln-210 and Glu-210) mutations. For wild-type and all the mutant R subunits, site A affinities estimated by the assays of intrachain coupling between sites A and B were substantially lower than those determined by more direct assays of cAMP binding (above). The apparent discrepancies between cAMP concentrations required to saturate site A (Fig. 1, Fig. 2) and those required to slow cAMP dissociation from site B (Fig. 3) suggested that something more than simple occupation of site A might be required for the allosteric effect on site B. Furthermore, it was unclear from the experiments of Fig. 3 whether or not the stronger mutations disrupted partially the allosteric coupling between sites A and B. In an attempt to understand better how intrachain coupling was related to occupation of site A, we repeated the coupling experiments using either Bz-cAMP or cGMP as the ligand for site A. Bz-cAMP binds to site A with about 3.5-times, and cGMP with about 0.005-times, the affinity of cAMP (4Øgreid D. Ekanger R. Suva R.H. Miller J.P. Døskeland S.O. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 181: 19-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Fig. 4 shows the data from assays in high salt buffer for R subunits with representative weak (Ile-210), intermediate (Lys-210), or strong (Gln-210) mutations. Consistent with their relative affinities for site A, Bz-cAMP shifted the dose-response curves to the left, and cGMP shifted the curv"

In order to investigate whether sequential processing at predefined sites is in fact required for proper processing, site-directed mutagenesis was performed to block known initial cleavage sites within proenkephalin. Pulse-chase/immunoprecipitation experiments were employed to analyze the fate of mutant and native proenkephalins in stably transfected AtT-20 cells. While processing did not occur at blockaded sites, surprisingly, overall processing of mutant proenkephalins proceeded efficiently, and alternative sites were chosen. When compared with native proenkephalin, processing of mutant proenkephalins occurred more slowly at early stages and more quickly at later stages. Experiments employing endoglycosidase H indicated that the early slow processing of mutant proenkephalins may be due to delays in intracellular transport. Metabolic labeling studies showed that more efficient production of bioactive opioids occurred in all processing site blockade mutants examined; these results were confirmed using several different radioimmunoassays of stored peptide products. We conclude that efficient processing of prohormone precursors does not require a specific temporal order of processing events. The fact that mutant proenkephalins were more fully processed than native proenkephalin may provide a route for more efficient production of opioid peptides in applications for chronic pain treatment.

In endocrine and neuronal cells, peptide hormones and proneuropeptides are synthesized as large precursor proteins that are then endoproteolytically processed during intracellular transport to produce the biologically active molecules. After posttranslational modification, these precursors are sorted in the trans-Golgi network and packed into dense core secretory vesicles for storage until release upon stimulation (1Mains R.

Common recognition sites present in these proproteins are pairs of basic amino acid residues, such as the preferentially cleaved Lys-Arg and Arg-Arg sites, and less frequently Lys-Lys and Arg-Lys pairs (reviewed in 1Mains R.

Proenkephalin (PE), which in AtT-20 cells is synthesized in both N-glycosylated and unglycosylated forms (8Mathis J.P. Lindberg I. Endocrinology. 1992; 131: 2287-2296Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), is endoproteolytically cleaved at 12 pairs of basic residues into enkephalin-containing peptides and mature enkephalins. Posttranslational processing of PE in the brain results mainly in the production of penta- to octapeptide opioids, while adrenal medullary chromaffin cells predominantly process this precursor to intermediate sized enkephalin-containing peptides (9Udenfriend S. Kilpatrick D.L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1983; 221: 309-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar, 10Wilson S.P. J. Neurochem. 1991; 57: 876-881Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). AtT-20 cells, a mouse anterior pituitary tumor cell line, represent a convenient model system in which to study prohormone processing. In this cell line, cleavage of PE occurs at Lys-Lys sites to produce intermediate sized peptides (8Mathis J.P. Lindberg I. Endocrinology. 1992; 131: 2287-2296Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar); similar Lys-Lys cleavage within other precursors such as proopiomelanocortin (11Giles N. Keutmann H.T. Mains R.E. Mol. Endocrinol. 1991; 5: 404-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) or proneuropeptide Y (12Dickerson I.M. Dixon J.E. Mains R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 2462-2469Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) occurs inefficiently, suggesting that structural features within proenkephalin are permissive for cleavage at this site. Site-directed mutagenesis of prohormones at cleavage sites has been used to investigate the importance of particular types of sites in order to potentially relate site usage to the action of the two prohormone convertases. Many prohormones have been studied in this manner, among others proinsulin (13Docherty K. Rhodes C.J. Taylor N.A. Sheenan K.I.J. Hutton J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 18335-18339Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), prosomatostatin (14Stoller T.J. Shields D. J. Biol.

Chem. 1990; 265: 2462-2469Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), egg-laying hormone (16Jung L. Kreiner T. Scheller R.H. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 121: 11-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), and insulin-like growth factor 1 (17Duguay S.J. Lai-Zhang J. Steiner D.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17566-17574Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Processing of precursor molecules including PE is known to occur in a sequential order, i.e. a predefined order exists with regard to the various cleavage events (1Mains R. Dickerson I.M. May V. Stoffers D.A. Perkins S.N. Ouafik L. Husten E.J. Eipper B.A. Front. Neuroendocrinol. 1990; 11: 52-89Google Scholar, 8Mathis J.P. Lindberg I. Endocrinology. 1992; 131: 2287-2296Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 18Zhou A. Bloomquist B.T. Mains R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1763-1769Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The elements controlling this sequence are unclear. A possible mechanism underlying this phenomenon is that cleavage at one site causes conformational rearrangements in the molecule, which are required to expose subsequent processing sites. Indeed, evidence that initial cleavage of proinsulin by PC1 is required prior to PC2 cleavage has been presented (19Rhodes C.J. Lincoln B. Shoelson S.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 22719-22726Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). PE is initially cleaved at a site that results in the production of Peptide B; shortly thereafter, another cleavage at Lys196-Arg197 occurs, resulting in intermediate sized enkephalin-containing peptides that can ultimately be processed to enkephalins (8Mathis J.P. Lindberg I. Endocrinology. 1992; 131: 2287-2296Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). If the orderly nature of prohormone processing is due to sequential unfolding and conformational rearrangements following each cleavage, then blockade of processing at initial sites would be expected to block further processing events. The purpose of these experiments was to examine the effect of blockade of such initial processing in the model precursor PE. Stably transfected AtT-20 cells were used in this study, since it has been amply demonstrated that these cells have a high rate of biosynthesis of peptide products and are capable of processing exogenous prohormones, including proenkephalin. This cell line was transfected with either native or mutant forms of PE containing blockade(s) at known cleavage sites. Surprisingly, we found that processing of PEs with processing site blockade mutations proceeded more slowly during initial stages but more quickly at later stages, ultimately resulting in higher levels of stored opioid peptides. Rat preproenkephalin cDNA (20Yoshikawa K. Williams C. Sabol S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 14301-14308Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was excised from the plasmid pEV/rENK (21Lindberg I. Shaw E. Finley J. Leone D. Deininger P. Endocrinology. 1991; 128: 1849-1856Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) and ligated into pRcCMV (+) (Invitrogen) as described previously (8Mathis J.P. Lindberg I. Endocrinology. 1992; 131: 2287-2296Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Three individual mutations and one double mutation of paired basic residues of PE were performed as shown in Fig. 1. The first individual mutation altered Lys237 to His237 and Arg238 to Lys238 and was termed K1. The second individual mutation converted Lys196 to His196 and Arg197 to Lys197 and was designated K2. The third individual mutation involved the alteration of Lys141 to His141 and was called K3. The double mutation, named K4, contained the same mutations as K1 and two additional substitutions, Lys210 to His210 and Arg211 to Lys211. The mutations were carried out by the Kunkel method (22Kunkel T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 488-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (4900) Google Scholar) and were confirmed by dideoxy DNA method using standard methods. The oligonucleotides employed as mutagenesis primers were as follows: 5′-TAGAGACTCAGCAAATTTGTGCAGGAAGCCTCC-3′ for K1 mutant PE; 5′-TTCCAGCTGGGGGCTTTTGTGGAGGCCTCTCAT-3′ for the K2 mutant PE; 5′-TCCCTCATCTGCATCTTTGTGCATGAAACCGCC-3′ for the K3 mutant PE; and 5′-CAGGAAGCCTCCGTATTTGTGCTGATAGTCCAT-3′ for the K4 mutant PE. Plasmids were produced in Escherichia coli and isolated by standard procedures (23Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Before use in transfection procedures, plasmids were purified twice by centrifugation through CsCl2 gradients. AtT-20/dv16 cells (obtained from R. E. Mains and B. A. Eipper) were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) containing 2.5% fetal bovine serum (Irvine Scientific, CA) and 10% NuSerum (Irvine Scientific) at 37°C in an atmosphere containing 5% CO2. The cells were stably transfected with the following expression plasmids containing the mutations: His237-Lys238 (K1), His196-Lys197 (K2), His141-Lys142 (K3), and His210-Lys211-His237-Lys238 (K4). The Lipofectin (Life Technologies, Gaithersburg, MD) method was used for transfection. Following removal of transfection medium at 5 h, cells were trypsinized and diluted into a peel-top T-162 flask. Twenty-four stable transfectants resistant to the neomycin analog G418 (0.6 mg/ml, ∼50% active, Life Technologies, Inc.) were subcloned by the soft agar method as described previously (24Lindberg I. Zhou Y. Methods Neurosci. 1995; 23: 94-108Crossref Scopus (21) Google Scholar). RIA screening was performed to select proenkephalin-expressing clones. Cells were grown in 35-mm wells for 2 days before use to approximately 80% confluence. Cells were scraped into 1 ml of ice-cold 1 M acetic acid, 20 mM HCl, and 0.1% (v/v) β-mercaptoethanol (solution A). Cell extracts were frozen and thawed, and insoluble material was removed by centrifugation. Samples were then subjected to a Met-enk-Arg-Phe radioimmunoassay as described previously (25Johanning K. Mathis J.P. Lindberg I. J. Neurochem. 1996; 66: 898-907Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The highest expressing clones of each cell line were selected for further study. For the pulse-chase experiments, subconfluent 35-mm wells (1-2 × 106 cells) of native PE-expressing and PE blockade mutant cell lines were subjected to the labeling procedure essentially as described (25Johanning K. Mathis J.P. Lindberg I. J. Neurochem. 1996; 66: 898-907Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). In brief, for the 20-min pulse labeling, 1 ml of methionine-free medium containing 1 mCi of [35S]methionine (average specific activity >1190 Ci/mmol, Amersham Corp.) was added to each well. Cells were then chased for 0, 0.5, 1, 2, or 4 h. After each chase incubation, cells were scraped into 1 ml of ice-cold solution A, and extraction of PE-derived peptides was performed as described earlier (25Johanning K. Mathis J.P. Lindberg I. J. Neurochem. 1996; 66: 898-907Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitation was also performed as described previously (8Mathis J.P. Lindberg I. Endocrinology. 1992; 131: 2287-2296Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 25Johanning K. Mathis J.P. Lindberg I. J. Neurochem. 1996; 66: 898-907Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) using 0.1 ml of the cell extracts and two different enkephalin antisera added to different sets of samples. The antisera used were raised against Peptide B/Met-enk-Arg-Phe (designated Xandra) (8Mathis J.P. Lindberg I. Endocrinology. 1992; 131: 2287-2296Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) and the 8.6-kDa peptide, Peptide F/Met-enk (designated Betty). Antiserum Betty was raised to a conjugate of Met-enkephalin coupled to keyhole limpet hemocyanin using glutaraldehyde, following a procedure described previously (26Lindberg I. Yang H.Y.T. Brain Res. 1984; 299: 73-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Immunoglobulins were purified from this antiserum using ammonium sulfate fractionation prior to use for immunoprecipitation. Immunoprecipitated proteins were extracted from the protein A-Sepharose beads using 130 µl of 32% (v/v) acetonitrile containing 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, 1 N acetic acid, and 6 M urea prior to high pressure gel permeation chromatography (HPGPC). Alternatively, beads were resuspended in a solution of 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, and 1%β-mercaptoethanol (solution B), boiled for 3 min, and spun, and the supernatant was collected for endoglycosidase H digestion (see below). Pulse-chase experiments were repeated three times on separate preparations of cells with qualitatively similar results. Pulse-chase experiments were performed using two or three different clones of each mutant proenkephalin, with comparable results. HPGPC was used to size-fractionate labeled immunoprecipitated peptides. A Beckman high pressure liquid chromatography system was used to pump the eluant through the column array, which consisted of a TSK gel precolumn (7.5 × 75 mm, Toso Hass, Montgomeryville, PA), two high pressure gel permeation columns connected in series, a Protein Pak SW 300 column (300 × 7.8 mm, Waters, Milford, MA), and a Bio-Sil TSK-125 column (300 × 7.5 mm, Bio-Rad). Fractions were collected with a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min, and radioactivity in each was determined by liquid scintillation spectroscopy following the addition of Ready Safe scintillation mixture (Beckman, Fullerton, CA). The recovery of radioactivity from the column array was quantitative. Standardization of the HPGPC system was performed as described elsewhere (25Johanning K. Mathis J.P. Lindberg I. J. Neurochem. 1996; 66: 898-907Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) using [35S]proenkephalin, Peptide B, Met-enk-Arg-Phe, Peptide F, and Met-enk. Total cellular content of various enkephalins was determined by RIA in the native and mutant cell lines using the same amounts of total protein (for sample normalization, to account for differences in cell growth). Protein content was determined using a 20-µl sample of total cell extract after scraping the cells into cold solution A (Bio-Rad; Coomassie Brilliant Blue assay). The remainder of the samples were centrifuged for 10 min in a microcentrifuge at 4°C. Supernatants were collected and stored at −20°C until further analysis. Aliquots (77-100 µl) of the clarified cell extracts were injected onto the HPGPC together with 90 µg of gel filtration standards (Bio-Rad). Fractions were collected into polypropylene tubes to which 5 µg of bovine serum albumin was added as carrier. Duplicate aliquots of each cell line extract were subjected to radioimmunoassay using specific enkephalin antisera (8Mathis J.P. Lindberg I. Endocrinology. 1992; 131: 2287-2296Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 25Johanning K. Mathis J.P. Lindberg I. J. Neurochem. 1996; 66: 898-907Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). In order to determine whether or not there was any difference in the time that labeled precursor spent in transit from the endoplasmic reticulum to the later compartments of the trans-Golgi network, PE processing was compared between the native PE-expressing cells and the double-mutant PE-expressing cell line, K4. Native and K4 cells were metabolically labeled as described above. However, cells were chased for 0, 20, 40, 60, and 90 min. After resuspension of the immune complexes in 130 µl of solution B, samples were boiled for 3 min to denature proteins and centrifuged to collect the supernatants. Duplicate samples (30 µl) of each supernatant were diluted 1:2 with 100 mM sodium acetate, pH 5.5, containing 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Samples corresponding to each cell line were divided into two sets, a control and an endoglycosidase H (endo H) treatment group, and the procedure that followed was as described previously (27Lindberg I. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 1994; 5: 263-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) except that samples were subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in 20% acrylamide gels (16 × 16 cm). Gels were fixed, fluorimpregnated, dried, and exposed to Hyperfilm (Amersham Corp.) using intensifying screens for 1 week. Gels were then quantitated by phosphoimaging analysis. Experiments were performed two times on separate preparations of cells with similar results. In order to identify the metabolic intermediate eluting at fraction 35 in the K1 cells, a subconfluent 35-mm well of this cell line (approximately 1-2 × 106 cells) was used for labeling and immunoprecipitation experiments. One ml of methionine-deficient medium (Amersham) containing 1 mCi of [35S]methionine was added, and cells were incubated at 37°C in an atmosphere containing 5% CO2 for 6 h. The immunoprecipitation procedure followed was as described above, using a combination of Xandra antiserum (8Mathis J.P. Lindberg I. Endocrinology. 1992; 131: 2287-2296Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) and JAS antiserum (Met-enk-Arg-Phe) (28Moccheti I. Giorgi O. Schwartz J.P. Costa E. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1994; 106: 427-430Crossref Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitated peptides were separated by HPGPC. A major peak of radioactivity, which had an apparent molecular size of 5 kDa, was pooled and subjected to automated Edman degradation (performed by the San Diego State University Microchemical Core Facility). Each cleaved residue was collected for liquid scintillation counting. Radiosequencing was performed only once. Cells from each native and mutant PE-expressing clone were counted and 2.6 × 106 cells grown for 2 days in 10-cm Petri dishes. Duplicate 5-µl diluted (1:10) samples of the clarified cell extracts were subjected to RIA analyses to determine the overall proenkephalin expression level in each clone. In addition, duplicate aliquots of each fraction obtained from the HPGPC (as described above), were vacuum-dried in polypropylene tubes in the presence of bovine serum albumin as carrier protein. Fractions were resuspended in 100 µl of RIA buffer (0.1 M sodium phosphate, pH 7.4, containing 0.1% heat-treated bovine serum albumin, 50 mM sodium chloride, 0.1% sodium azide, and 0.1%β-mercaptoethanol) and subjected to RIA as described previously (26Lindberg I. Yang H.Y.T. Brain Res. 1984; 299: 73-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Briefly, specific antiserum, sample or standard, and ∼10,000 cpm of 125I-labeled peptide (Amersham) were incubated overnight at 4°C. The antisera used for RIA were raised against Met-enk-Arg-Phe (JAS antiserum) as described in 28Moccheti I. Giorgi O. Schwartz J.P. Costa E. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1994; 106: 427-430Crossref Scopus (27) Google Scholar, against Met-enk-Arg-Gly-Leu (29Lindberg I. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 16317-16322Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), or against Met-enk (RB4 antiserum; 30Giraud P. Eiden L.E. Audigier Y. Gillioz Conte-Devols B. Bourdouresque F. Eskay R. Oliver C. Neuropeptides. 1981; 1: 237-252Crossref Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Carrier γ-globulin and 25% polyethylene glycol were added to precipitate the bound label, which was separated by centrifugation. Radioactivity in pellets was determined using an LKB γ-counter. RIAs of all cell lines were carried out at least four times on independent preparations of cells with similar results. In order to examine the effect of site blockade on the processing of PE, four mutant cell lines were constructed. Fig. 1 depicts a diagrammatic representation of PE showing the different sites of mutation and the peptides known to be generated from the precursor molecule. To investigate the effect of site blockade processing in PE in AtT-20 cells, pulse-chase experiments were carried out on cells expressing native PE and a single blockade mutant (at the initial cleavage site; K1 in Fig. 1). Fig. 2 shows the fate of the Met-enk-Arg-Phe portion of native and mutant PEs. For these experiments, immunoprecipitation was performed using antiserum directed against Met-enk-Arg-Phe, the carboxyl-terminal peptide of PE (this antiserum recognizes all peptides terminating in this heptapeptide). A single peak, corresponding to the approximate elution position of PE, was observed in both cell lines after a 20-min pulse. Native proenkephalin was initially processed more quickly than the K1 mutant (Fig. 2, compare panels A and B at 0.5 h of chase), as shown by a stronger decrease in the peak size of PE relative to 0 h as well as the presence of a processing product in native PE, which was not observed in the K1 mutant at this time. The K1 mutant instead exhibited an intermediate peak of unknown identity (designated as I1; fraction 35, approximately 5 kDa) and a small peak that corresponded to the elution position of the Met-enk-Arg-Phe standard (fraction 45). At 1 h of chase, conversion of Peptide B to Met-enk-Arg-Phe was evident in native PE. The final molar ratio of Peptide B to Met-enk-Arg-Phe was 2.5:1 in this cell line. By comparison, the K1 mutant still contained intact PE and exhibited a 0.1:1 molar ratio of I1 to Met-enk-Arg-Phe, indicating a faster processing to active PE-derived opioids at 1 h of chase. Similar results to the above were observed at the 2-h chase time. Two peaks corresponding to Peptide B and Met-enk-Arg-Phe, at a molar ratio of 1:1, were observed in native PE (Fig. 2A; note that two methionines are present in Peptide B but only one in Met-enk-Arg-Phe). At this time, about 40% of the total radioactivity in the immunoprecipitate was present as Met-enk-Arg-Phe in the mutant PE, as compared with only about 12% in native PE (compare panels A and B, 2-h chase time). The molar ratio of Peptide B to Met-enk-Arg-Phe was 0.7:1 in native PE at 4 h of chase; however, intermediate peptide was not present in the mutant cell line at this time point. Therefore, contrary to our expectations, these results indicate that PE processing in the K1 mutant was not halted but instead followed an alternative pathway of cleavage involving the intermediate I1. While processing of PE at initial stages proceeded more slowly in the mutant cell line, conversion of the larger intermediate to Met-enk-Arg-Phe in fact occurred at a more rapid rate. These experiments were repeated three times with similar results. To identify the cleavage site involved in the production of the 5-kDa Met-enk-Arg-Phe peptide from the K1 mutant PE, radiosequencing of the radiolabeled peptide was carried out. Automated Edman degradation yielded a major peak of radioactivity during the fifth cycle, indicating the presence of [35S]methionine or [35S]cysteine (Fig. 3). Taken together with the ability of the peptide to be immunoprecipitated with Met-enk-Arg-Phe antiserum and the molecular size of the peptide, these data indicate that the peptide sequenced was most likely generated by cleavage on the carboxyl side of Lys210-Arg211. This extended form of Peptide B is indicated by an asterisk in the PE diagram (Fig. 1). The radiosequencing results thus suggest that an alternative site, but in fact not the nearest paired basic site, was used for initial cleavage when the naturally preferred site was unavailable. Since the processing of PE was apparently not hampered by a mutation at the initial processing site, we decided to blockade the newly chosen site (Lys210-Arg211) as well in the K1 mutant (Fig. 1). This new PE mutant, termed K4, was subjected to a similar pulse-chase analysis as described above. Results from the metabolic labeling of PE in native PE and double mutation PE are shown in Fig. 4. At the 0.5-h chase time, more than two-thirds of total PE in native, but only one-half of total PE in the K4 mutant, was processed (compare panels A and B). Also at 0.5 h, a second peak was observed in both cases. For native PE this peak corresponded to Peptide B, while in the K4 mutant the second peak corresponded to another intermediate (designated as I2). Given the molecular mass of this peptide and its ability to be immunoprecipitated with Met-enk-Arg-Phe antiserum, we speculate that this peak is a product of alternative cleavage at the carboxyl side of residues Arg217-Arg218. Following 1 h of chase, the molar ratio of Peptide B to Met-enk-Arg-Phe was 2.7:1 in native PE. In contrast, the molar ratio of I2:Met-enk-Arg-Phe was 0.3:1 in K4 at the chase time. These results indicate that processing of I2 to Met-enk-Arg-Phe was more extensive in K4 PE than the analogous processing event in native PE (Fig. 4). At 2 and 4 h of chase, this same trend continued, with higher Met-enk-Arg-Phe production in the K4 mutant PE as compared with native PE. At 4 h of chase, the molar ratio of Peptide B to Met-enk-Arg-Phe in native PE was 0.8:1; however, in the K4 mutant the intermediate peptide had been completely converted to Met-enk-Arg-Phe. In summary, these results demonstrate that like the K1 mutant, K4 mutant PE was processed more slowly at initial steps, but more rapidly and more completely at later s"
https://openalex.org/W2155513564,"Abstract The upstream half of the human adenovirus type 2 enhancer adopts a curved DNA structure. Most of the enhancer elements are within the curvature, suggesting that this unusual structure is linked to enhancer function. To verify this experimentally, I constructed in vitro transcription assay systems which could distinguish any effects generated by conformational changes in a DNA template. The curved DNA conformation in the enhancer clearly affected the extent of the stimulation of the E1A gene transcription: assays using the wild-type DNA template showed that the moderately curved enhancer was superior to the highly curved enhancer in transcriptional stimulation. In additional experiments, the enhancer region was substituted with a curved DNA derived from the bacteriophage λ origin of replication. Assays using this mutant revealed that this curved segment could also act as an enhancer when it had the proper conformation. Consequently, DNA conformation may play a general role in transcriptional stimulation."

The NOE cross-peaks for each proton pair of a nucleotide can be easily identified and inter-proton distances of the enzyme-bound nucleotide can thus be determined by their relative NOE intensities. A molecular model of the enzyme-bound nucleotide can then be constructed using an energy minimization molecular modeling program with the NOE determined inter-proton distance constraints. This report presents the determination of the conformation of IMP (Fig. 1) bound to IMPDH-h2 by the TRNOESY method and molecular modeling, showing that IMP adopts an anti conformation for the glycosidic bond and 2E pucker for the sugar ring. D2O (99.9%), DCl (99% D), NAD, and the free acid of IMP were purchased from Sigma. Perdeuterated Tris-d11 (99%), dithiothreitol-d10 (98%), and glycerol-d8 (99%) were purchased from CDN Isotopes Inc. The construction of the IMPDH-h2 expression system was described in our previous report (8Xiang B. Taylor J.C. Markham G.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1435-1440Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The standard assay for the IMPDH-h2 activity was carried out in 100 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.1) buffer at 37°C with 0.2 mM IMP, 0.2 mM NAD, and 10 mM K+ as described before (8Xiang B. Taylor J.C. Markham G.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1435-1440Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The reaction rate was determined by the increase of absorbance at 340 nm. The enzyme purification protocol was modified to use larger chromatographic columns. The crude cell lysate from a 2-liter culture (the supernatant collected after breaking the cells in a French press followed by centrifugation to remove cell debris) was loaded onto a Blue Sepharose CL-6B (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) column (5 × 30 cm). IMPDH-h2 was eluted by a linear gradient of 20-500 mM KCl in 2000 ml of buffer A (20 mM Tris, 1 mM EDTA-Na4, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 20 mM KCl, pH 8.1, with HCl). Fractions with high IMPDH activity were collected and desalted by dialysis against buffer A (two changes of 1000 ml each). This solution was loaded onto a Q-Sepharose (Pharmacia) anion exchange column (5 × 30 cm) and eluted by linear gradient of 100-700 mM KCl in 2000 ml of buffer A. The fractions with high IMPDH activity were collected and dialyzed against buffer B (20 mM Tris, 1 mM EDTA-Na4, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 20 mM KCl, 2% glycerol, pH 8.1, with HCl) with two changes of 1000 ml each. The purity of the final IMPDH-h2 solution was verified by SDS-gel electrophoresis and estimated to be at least 95′. For NMR studies, the buffer was exchanged to replace the buffer B of the IMPDH-h2 solution with perdeuterated NMR buffer (99.9% D2O containing 20 mM Tris-d11, 1 mM dithiothreitol-d10, 2% glycerol-d8, 20 mM KCl, pD 8.1, with DCl); the exchange was carried out using a Centriprep-10 concentrator (purchased from Amicon Inc.) at 8°C. An IMPDH-h2 solution was first concentrated to 0.5 ml. It was diluted with the NMR buffer to 5 ml and then concentrated to 0.5 ml. The dilution-concentration cycle was repeated three times. The IMPDH-h2 concentration of the final solution was determined by comparing its activity to the activity of newly purified enzyme. We have determined that each IMPDH-h2 tetramer has four active sites (8Xiang B. Taylor J.C. Markham G.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1435-1440Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The final active site or IMP-binding site concentration in the NMR sample was 0.11 mM. The free acid of IMP was dissolved in water to 4 mM and was titrated with KOH to pH 8.1. H2O was removed from 5 ml of this IMP/K+ solution under reduced pressure using a Speed Vac device (Savant Inc.). This dried IMP/K+ was then redissolved in 0.5 ml of the IMPDH-h2 solution in NMR buffer. The [IMP]/[IMP-binding site] ratio was 36. Additional measurements were made at 4 mM IMP, 0.4 mM IMPDH-h2, and 2 mM IMP, 0.2 mM-IMPDH-h2 with analogous results to those described below. A Bruker DMX600 NMR spectrometer and standard pulse programs were used. The solution of IMP/K and IMPDH-h2 was placed in a 5-mm diameter NMR tube for NMR measurements. The sample temperature was maintained at 10°C. NOESY data were collected in TPPI mode with 256 t1 increments and 2,000 t2 points. Thirty-two scans were accumulated for each t1 value. The longitudinal relaxation times of the protons of IMP (assignments shown in Fig. 2) were determined to be ∼1 s by inversion recovery. A relaxation delay of 2 s was thus used for the NOESY measurements. The HDO peak was suppressed by presaturation during the relaxation delay. Six NOESY data sets with mixing times of 40, 70, 100, 130, 160, and 200 ms were collected consecutively in 2 days. The IMPDH-h2 activity did not change during data collection. The NMR data were transferred to a Silicon Graphics computer and were processed by the program FELIX (Hare Research, Inc.). Two-dimensional Fourier transformation was performed with a 90° shifted sine bell window function in both dimensions and zero filling to yield an 1024 × 1024 matrix. t1 noise was reduced by dividing the first data point by 2 before the second Fourier transformation (38Otting G. Widmer H. Wagner G. Wuthrich K. J. Magn. Reson. 1986; 66: 187-193Google Scholar). The FACELIFT program (National NMR Facility in Madison, WI) was used to perform base point correction on the transformed two-dimensional matrix. The volumes of the NOE cross-peaks and diagonal peaks were determined using the FELIX program with the same scale for all the spectra. The NMR peak intensity of each proton at zero mixing time was determined by extrapolation of its diagonal peak volumes at different mixing times to zero mixing time. The percentage NOE intensity (Inoe) was the ratio of the NOE cross-peak volume divided by the volume of the diagonal peak at zero mixing time. The NOE build-up curves for each cross-peak were constructed and simulated with a polynomial equation using the SCIENTIST program (developed by MicroMath Scientific Software) to determine the initial NOE build-up rate, Rij, as described under “Results.” The inter-proton distance, r1′2′, between H1′ and H2′ of 2.90 Å was used as the internal reference since this distance is not sensitive to the conformation (25Jarori G.K. Murali N. Switzer R.L. Rao B.D.N. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 230: 517-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). The inter-proton distance (rij) between Hi and Hj was determined from their initial NOE build-up rate (Rij) relative to that of H1′ and H2′ (R1′2′) using Equation 1 (25Jarori G.K. Murali N. Switzer R.L. Rao B.D.N. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 230: 517-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). rij=r1′2⋅R1′2/Rij1/6(Eq. 1) A molecular model of IMP was constructed by energy minimization with the inter-proton distances determined by NOESY measurements as constraints using the program MacroModel (version 4.5, Department of Chemistry, Columbia University) on a Silicon Graphics computer. The AMBER force field was used and a 10% uncertainty in distances was allowed without energy penalty. The torsion angles of the energy minimization model were determined from the lowest energy structure. Fig. 2 shows the 600 MHz one-dimensional 1H NMR spectrum of a IMP and IMPDH-h2 mixture at the resolution used for TRNOESY measurements. The peaks at 8.44, 8.04, 5.91, 4.55, 4.24, and 4.09 ppm are assigned to H8, H2′, H1′, H2′, H3′, and H4′, respectively (25Jarori G.K. Murali N. Switzer R.L. Rao B.D.N. Eur. J.

When a spectrum was obtained at higher digital resolution, resonances were a doublet at 5.91 ppm for H1, a triplet at 4.55 ppm for H2, a triplet at 4.24 ppm for H3′, and multiple peaks for H4 at 4.09 ppm, and for H5′1 and H5′2 near 3.72 ppm. The broad peak at 4.8 ppm arises from the residual HDO signal. The peaks are slightly broadened due to the interaction of IMP with the enzyme. The protein peaks are not seen due to the line broadening resulting from the slow tumbling of the 223-kDa protein. Fig. 3 shows the NOESY spectrum obtained at 200 ms mixing time. The diagonal peaks correspond to those seen in the spectrum in Fig. 2. Clear NOE cross-peaks can be seen for every proton pair except those between H2 and other protons. The NOESY spectra at shorter mixing times show the same characteristics but weaker NOE cross-peaks. The NOESY spectrum at 200 ms mixing time of a control sample without the protein showed no NOE cross-peaks. Spectra obtained at twice the IMP concentration showed cross-peaks similar to those in Fig. 3. The volumes of the diagonal peak for H1′ (5.91 ppm) at different mixing times were measured, and the nearly linear increase of the peak volume with decreasing mixing time was extrapolated to zero mixing time to obtain the NMR peak volume at zero mixing time. The volume of each NOE cross-peak at different mixing times was measured and the percentage NOE intensities (Inoe) were calculated by dividing NOE peak volumes by the NMR peak volume of H1′ at zero mixing time. The NOE build-up curves for each cross-peak were constructed and simulated. The relation between NOE intensity (Inoe) and mixing time (tm) can be described by Equation 2 (25Jarori G.K. Murali N. Switzer R.L. Rao B.D.N. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 230: 517-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar): Inoe=1−exp−Rtm(Eq. 2) which can also be written as: Inoe=Rtm−12R2tm2+16R3tm3−…(Eq. 3) where R is the relaxation matrix which has elements, Rij, that describe the initial build-up rate of the NOE peak between Hi and Hj (25Jarori G.K. Murali N. Switzer R.L. Rao B.D.N. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 230: 517-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). In this study, the NOE peaks which showed a clear linear increase in their intensities with mixing time were simulated by Equation 4. Inoe=Rijtm(Eq. 4) Those NOE peaks which showed deviation from the linear build-up at longer mixing times were simulated by Equation 5: Inoe=Rijtm−aijtm2(Eq. 5) where aij is a constant. The NOE peak between H3′ and H4′ partially overlapped with diagonal peaks of H3′ and H4′ (Fig. 3) and thus was simulated by Equation 6 to include the contribution from diagonal peaks as a constant cij. Inoe=cij+Rijtm−aijtm2(Eq. 6) The build-up curves for the NOE peaks are shown in Fig. 4. The simulation parameters Rij, aij, and cij are listed in tbl I. The distance of 2.90 Å between H1′ and H2′ was used as the internal reference since this distance is approximately independent of the ribose conformation. Other inter-proton distances (rnoe) were calculated using Equation 1 and the initial build-up rate Rij. These distances are shown in tblI.Table INOE build-up simulation parameters Rij, aij, and cij (defined by Equations 4, 5, and 6) and inter-proton distances rnoe (determined from the NOE intensity) and rem (from the energy minimized model) of IMP bound to IMPDH-h2.Proton pairRij, ms−1aij, ms−2cij,rnoe, Arem, A1′-2′0.0254 ± 0.00033.3 e-5 ± 0.2 e-52.903.011′-3′0.00821 ± 0.00083.403.861′-4′0.0169 ± 0.00051.8 e-5 ± 0.3 e-53.103.301′-5′10.0027 ± 0.00024.215.031′-5′20.0027 ± 0.00024.214.612′-3′0.086 ± 0.0022 e-4 ± 1 e-42.372.182′-4′0.0114 ± 0.00051.1 e-5 ± 0.3 e-53.313.852′-5′10.0095 ± 0.00079 e-6 ± 4 e-63.424.032′-5′20.0095 ± 0.00079 e-6 ± 4 e-63.424.173′-4′0.024 ± 0.0024.7 e-5 ± 0.8 e-53.3 ± 0.12.932.983′-5′10.036 ± 0.0017.7 e-5 ± 0.7 e-52.742.613′-5′20.036 ± 0.0017.7 e-5 ± 0.7 e-52.743.614′-5′10.067 ± 0.00114.9 e-5 ± 0.7 e-52.472.384′-5′20.067 ± 0.00114.9 e-5 ± 0.7 e-52.472.528-1′0.0252 ± 0.00052.9 e-5 ± 0.3 e-52.903.658-2′0.0646 ± 0.000512.1 e-5 ± 0.3 e-52.482.278-3′0.0226 ± 0.00052.9 e-5 ± 0.3 e-52.963.708-4′0.00544 ± 0.000063.754.288-5′10.00557 ± 0.000063.734.148-5′20.00557 ± 0.000063.733.38 Open table in a new tab Molecular modeling with constrained energy minimization was used to construct the minimum energy model of IMP bound to IMPDH-h2. All the NOESY determined inter-proton distances, rnoe in tbl I, were used as distance constraints with approximately 10% variation allowed. The inter-proton distances (rem) of this model are also shown in tbl I. The torsion angles are shown in tbl II (39(1983) Eur. J. Biochem., 131, 9–15.Google Scholar, 40Saenger, W., Cantor, C.

The inosine base adopts anti-orientation about the glycosyl C1′-N9 bond relative to the sugar moiety. The sugar ring assumes nonplanar C2′-endo-conformation (2E). The pseudorotation phase angle, P, is 166°Calculated from Equation 7 (40Saenger, W., Cantor, C.

Open table in a new tab The angles β(P-O5′-C5-C4) and γ(05′-C5′-C1′-C3′) are derived from the energy minimization modeling only since there were no appropriate experimental constraints. The good fits of the simulated NOE build-up curves to the experimental data for NOE intensities at different mixing times in Fig. 4 and the small standard deviations of the parameters Rij indicate the high reliability of the NOE determined inter-proton distances rnoe. The inter-proton distances, rem, of the energy-minimized model are generally very close to the experimental values rnoe. The difference between rem and rnoe is within 20% for all the proton pairs of the sugar ring. In constructing the energy-minimized model, the magnetic interactions between IMP and the protein and the effects of the solvent were not included. This simplification may contribute to the deviations of some rem values from rnoe (tblI). No NOE cross-peaks were observed for a control sample of IMP without IMPDH-h2, or a sample with an equal amount of thermally-inactivated enzyme, which confirms that the observed NOE cross-peaks in the NOESY spectra (Fig. 3) of the IMP and IMPDH-h2 mixture are due to the binding of IMP to the enzyme. The NOE cross-peaks and the broadening of the NMR peaks indicate the existence of IMP-IMPDH-h2 complexes which are in fast exchange with free IMP and IMPDH-h2 molecules. Two mechanisms have been proposed for the IMPDH-catalyzed reaction (41Hedstrom L. Wang C.C. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 849-854Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 42Antonino L.C. Wu J.C. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 1753-1759Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). One is a non-covalent mechanism which does not involve a bond formation between the enzyme and IMP. Another involves covalent catalysis with transient bond formation between the sulfur of Cys-331 and C2 of IMP (17Link J.O. Straub K. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1996; 118: 2091-2092Crossref Scopus (56) Google Scholar); if this reaction occurs in the absence of NAD it must be rapidly reversible. The sugar pucker of a nucleotide is defined by its pseudorotation phase angle (40Saenger, W., Cantor, C. R., (eds) (1984) Principles of Nucleic Acid Structure, pp. 9–28, Springer-Verlag, New York.Google Scholar, 45Altona C. Sundaralingam M. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1972; 94: 8205-8212Crossref PubMed Scopus (2000) Google Scholar). In different enzyme-nucleotide complexes, the pseudorotation phase angle varies and the nucleotides take different sugar puckers (25Jarori G.K. Murali N. Switzer R.L. Rao B.D.N. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 230: 517-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 26Murali N. Jarori G.K. Landy S.B. Rao B.D.N.

The pseudorotation phase angle of IMP bound to IMPDH-h2 (166°) is comparable to that of 2E puckering (162°) and the torsion angle v4 (−2°) approximates 0° (40Saenger, W., Cantor, C. R., (eds) (1984) Principles of Nucleic Acid Structure, pp. 9–28, Springer-Verlag, New York.Google Scholar). Therefore, the sugar pucker of the bound IMP is very close to envelope C2′-endo (2E). The strong NOE cross-peaks between H8 and protons in the sugar ring in the NOESY spectrum (Fig. 3) are direct evidence for an anti-conformation for the inosine base versus the sugar ring. The energy-minimized model of the bound IMP confirmed the anti-conformation. Similar anti-conformations are taken by enzyme-bound ATP and ADP in many other systems with many having torsional angles of ∼50°Comparable to that found here (25Jarori G.K. Murali N. Switzer R.L. Rao B.D.N. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 230: 517-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 26Murali N. Jarori G.K. Landy S.B. Rao B.D.N.

For IMPDH the anti-conformation of the inosine base keeps H2 away from the bulk of the sugar moiety and opens it for binding and reaction and thus is consistent with the structural constraints required for substitution at C2. As this article was being completed, a crystal structure of hamster IMPDH in a complex with the inhibitor mycophenolic acid and a covalent thioimidate adduct between the active site cysteine and C2 of oxidized IMP was published; this structure supports the anti-conformation of the glycosidic bond but suggests a C3′-endo-conformation of the sugar (46Sintchak M.D. Fleming M.A. Futer O. Raybuck S.A. Chambers S.P. Caron P.R. Murcko M.A. Wilson K.P. Cell. 1996; 85: 921-930Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar). Whether the differences in sugar conformation are due to the differences in the complexes studied or to differences in experimental conditions remains to be ascertained. Another enzyme that catalyzes a reaction at the C2 position of a nucleotide is the subsequent enzyme in the pathway of GMP synthesis, GMP synthetase. In this reaction, the oxygen at position 2 of XMP is replaced by a NH2 moiety. Unfortunately in the recently reported crystal structure of GMP synthetase, XMP was not found although it was essential for crystal formation (47Tesmer J.J.G. Klem T.J. Deras M.L. Davisson V.J. Smith J.L. Nature Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 74-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). Thus the conformational similarities for substrate binding utilized by these enzymes remain unclear at present. It will be revealing to learn the similarities of substrate recognition for enzymes that catalyze these sequential reactions.
