https://openalex.org/W1973358645,"Gm(a) and Gm(b) factors are present in 7S γ-globulin molecules and absent in 19S γ-globulins, β2A-globulins and Bence-Jones proteins, whereas the Inv(b) factor was demonstrated in all four kinds of proteins. The Inv type was identical in isolated 7S and 19S γ-globulins of six normal sera. After papain splitting of 7S γ-globulin, Gm determining sites were present only in the fast (F) split product and Inv determining sites were present only in the slow (S)."

The proteins examined included ribonuclease, bovine serum albumin, fi-lactoglobulin, pepsin, pepsinogen, chymotrypsin, chymotryp- sinogen, ovalbumin, aldolase, insulin, cytochrome c, myoglobin, lysozyme, and yeast alcohol dehydrogenase. The spectra range from low, broad, unresolved bands to sharply defined peaks with structure. The latter type of spec- trum reflects the amino acid composition of the protein. In the sequence, native ribonuclease, urea denatured protein, and performic acid oxidized protein, the spectra undergo a progressive narrowing and increase in resolution. Similar changes are ob- served between native and urea denatured forms of bovine serum albumin, aldolase, and chymotrypsin. A sharp, well re- solved spectrum is exhibited by the A chain of insulin, but not by the B chain. Insulin itself shows a moderately resolved spectrum. The increase in resolution is attributed to an increase in the segmental motions of the peptide chain which decrease the effectiveness of dipole-dipole interactions. Absorptions of protons bonded to nitrogen which exchange very slowly with the solvent can be observed in the spectra of ribonuclease, insulin, and other proteins. The spectra of cytochrome c and myoglobin exhibit anomalous absorptions at very high fields and in the region of 47. These arise possibly through a ring-current effect of the porphyrin. The spectra of these two proteins change with the oxidation state of the iron. The differences that are observed probably arise from a modification in the structure of the protein moiety rather than from a change in the electronic spin relaxation time of the iron.

https://openalex.org/W2081744104,"Microelectrodes were used to record intracellularly from the filamentous fungus Neurospora crassa. Under standard conditions membrane potentials averaged 127 mv, inside negative. The potentials were potassium-sensitive, and depended upon the distance of the cells from the growing margin of the colony. In addition, the potentials were quickly reduced to about 30 mv in the presence of low concentrations of sodium azide or the polyene antibiotic nystatin."
https://openalex.org/W2110668064,"It has been reported that crystalline human myoglobin can be resolved by electrophoresis on paper into three components (1,2). Two of these possess nearly identical absorption spectra between 500 and 600 rnp and give the same reactions with oxygen. Although it was suggested that these components differ structurally (2), no evidence has been presented to support this view. In the present study the heterogeneity of human metmyoglobin has been examined with the aid of ion exchange chromatography. Five chromatographically distinct fractions, two of which represent approximately 75% of the myoglobin in skeletal muscle, have been found. Chemical and physical analyses of these fractions indicate that the globin is identical in the two myoglobins that are present in major amount. The differences in chromatographic and electrophoretic behavior of these fractions result from differences in the state of the iron in the heme prosthetic group. At least one of the other myoglobin components, which represents only a minor amount of the myoglobin of normal muscle, appears to differ in the primary structure of the globin moiety. The availability of large amounts of chromatographitally pure myoglobin has prompted further characterization of this protein."

https://openalex.org/W2062718639,An erythrocyte-free preparation of the erythrocytic stages of Plasmodium vinckei was made from infected mouse blood and disintegrated in a Hughes press. Rabbit antisera yielded a series of precipitation arcs against plasmodial extract when examined by immunoelectrophoresis. No arcs developed when uninfected mouse erythrocytes or stromata were tested against the same antiserum.

For both types of materials, amount recalled showed a positively accelerated increase with degree of overlearning. These increases in recall resulted from improved retention of relatively difficult parts of the lists. Speed of relearning to complete mastery was a direct function of degree of overlearning."

Injection of day-old chicks with erythrocytes inhibited production of agglutinins for lymphocytes as well as erythrocytes when subsequent immunizations were attempted."
https://openalex.org/W2067701626,"BOVINE cervical mucus has been shown to contain a mucoid which behaves as though its molecules were long, flexible and thread-like1. The elastic properties and the Weissenberg effect shown by native mucus (at œstrus) are traceable to this molecular form2. Native mucus may be drawn out into thick threads in which the mucus is anisotropic due to the uncoiling and alignment of the molecules along the lines of strain. It is probable that mucus secreted by the cervix uteri and expressed into the vagina is in this condition, the lines of strain running along the path the spermatozoa should follow."

https://openalex.org/W2006510347,The so-called ambiguity of taste perception of D-mannose has been traced to actual differences in taste between the two anomers of this substance. Preliminary data indicate strongly that the α-anomer is sweet (sucrose-like) and the β-anomer is bitter (quinine-like). The difference in taste is attributed to the slight difference in structures of the anomers.

Indeed, it has been specifically noted that vitamin B12 deficiency has not been produced experimentally in monkeys1–3, and those macrocytic anæmias which have been induced are known to respond to treatment with folic acid (sometimes in association with ascorbic acid) but not to vitamin B12 (ref. 4)."

https://openalex.org/W1989138368,"LITTLE work has, as yet, been published dealing with the paper chromatography of urinary phenolic amines. Solvent systems used have been isopropanol–ammonia1 and n-butanol–ammonia or –methylamine2,3 for the first direction, followed by n-butanol–acetic acid1–3. Such systems, however, give poor resolutions, particularly in the group of amines derived from phenylethylamine, and have little potential use except for revealing grossly abnormal excretions of the few compounds that can be unambiguously identified: probably the demonstration of increased excretion of metanephrine and normetanephrine in phæochromocytoma3 or stress represents the limit of their usefulness."

https://openalex.org/W1994846339,"In cats with midpontine pretrigeminal transections, orientation reflexes to visual stimuli consist only of vertical eye movements, pupillary dilation, and electroencephalographic arousal. Extinction of the orientation reflex by repetition of the photic stimulus is easily obtained; the reflex partially recovers after a few minutes of rest. By using as reinforcement stimulation of hypothalamus producing pupillary dilation and EEG arousal, conditioned responses to a visual stimulus may be obtained. The cat with midpontine pretrigeminal transection can be used as convenient preparation for the study of the orientation and conditioned reflexes."

We had previously shown that such extracts had a high acid phosphatase and low alkaline phosphatase activity, but that a mammalian acid phosphatase did not dephosphorylate pyridoxal phosphate whereas an alkaline phosphatase did2."

https://openalex.org/W1966529735,"RECENTLY it was stated that morphogenetic movements in gastrulation of the viviparous teleost Fundulus heteroclitus occur in a normal fashion in cases in which cytokinesis is prevented by treatment with the antimitotic alkaloid colchicine1. To establish whether a more general significance should possibly be attached to this phenomenon a corresponding investigation was performed with a fish bearing live young, namely the viviparous cyprinodont Xiphophorus helleri, the swordtail. For this purpose pregnant females in the first phase of gestation were injected intraperitoneally with 0.5 ml. of 0.001 M colchicine solution. During gastrulation in stage 12 (beginning gastrula), 13 (advanced gastrula), 14 (further advanced gastrula) and 15 (closure of blastopore) both treated and control females were killed by decapitation and the ovaries were fixed in Bouin's fluid. The blastoderms were sectioned at 5µ and stained with Heidenhain's iron haematoxylin. The mitotic index, representing the ratio of cells in mitosis to the total number of cells, and expressed as per cent, was determined in each blastoderm on the basis of cell counts of the sections."

https://openalex.org/W2083086207,"IN dogs given iproniazid (‘Marsilid’) it was observed that Brecher's method1 for counting reticulocytes very clearly showed the presence of Heinz bodies2, which yielded a method for demonstration of both Heinz bodies and reticulocytes in the same preparation3. Since, to the best of my knowledge, nothing is known of the possible occurrence of Heinz bodies and reticulocytes in lower vertebrates, I performed a corresponding investigation with the lizard Uromastix acanthinurus. As staining technique the method of Brecher1 was used according to Thompson's method3. The erythrocytes appeared to be stained a pale greenish-blue, while the reticulum was deep blue and sharply outlined. The Heinz bodies stood out prominently against the pale-green background of the erythrocytes and were pale to deep blue. As in the dog erythrocytes3, these bodies were stained at least as well as by the usual methods2,4,5. As these results correspond very well with those obtained in the dog3 a more general importance should no doubt be attached to it."
