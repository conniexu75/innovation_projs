https://openalex.org/W2985004336,"The ability of microorganisms to generate resistance outcompetes with the generation of new and efficient antibiotics; therefore, it is critical to develop novel antibiotic agents and treatments to control bacterial infections. An alternative to this worldwide problem is the use of nanomaterials with antimicrobial properties. Silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) have been extensively studied due to their antimicrobial effect in different organisms. In this work, the synergistic antimicrobial effect of AgNPs and conventional antibiotics was assessed in Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. AgNPs minimal inhibitory concentration was 10–12 μg mL-1 in all bacterial strains tested, regardless of their different susceptibility against antibiotics. Interestingly, a synergistic antimicrobial effect was observed when combining AgNPs and kanamycin according to the fractional inhibitory concentration index, FICI: <0.5), an additive effect by combining AgNPs and chloramphenicol (FICI: 0.5 to 1), whereas no effect was found with AgNPs and β-lactam antibiotics combinations. Flow cytometry and TEM analysis showed that sublethal concentrations of AgNPs (6–7 μg mL-1) altered the bacterial membrane potential and caused ultrastructural damage, increasing the cell membrane permeability. No chemical interactions between AgNPs and antibiotics were detected. We propose an experimental supported mechanism of action by which combinatorial effect of antimicrobials drives synergy depending on their specific target, facilitated by membrane alterations generated by AgNPs. Our results provide a deeper understanding about the synergistic mechanism of AgNPs and antibiotics, aiming to combat antimicrobial infections efficiently, especially those by multi-drug resistant microorganisms, in order to mitigate the current crisis due to antibiotic resistance."
https://openalex.org/W2985999327,"Plants harbor diverse bacterial communities, which play crucial roles in plant health and growth, in their rhizosphere, phyllosphere and endosphere. Tomato is an important model for studying plant-microbe interactions, but comparison of its associated bacterial community is still lacking. In this study, using Illumina sequencing of 16S rRNA amplicons, we characterized and compared the bacterial size and community from rootzone soil as well as the rhizosphere, phyllosphere and endosphere of roots, stems, leaves, fruits and seeds of tomato plants that were grown in greenhouse conditions. Habitat (soil, phyllospheric, and endophytic) structured the community. The bacterial communities from the soil-type samples (rootzone soil and rhizosphere) showed the highest richness and diversity. The lowest bacterial diversity occurred in the phyllospheric samples, while the lowest richness occurred in the endosphere. Among the endophytic samples, both bacterial diversity and richness varied in different tissues, with the highest values in roots. The most abundant phyla in the tomato-associated community was Proteobacteria, with the exception of the seeds and jelly, where both Proteobacteria and Firmicutes were dominant. At the genus level, the sequences of Pseudomonas and Acinetobacter were prevalent in the rhizosphere, and in the phyllosphere, more than 97% of the sequences were assigned to Acinetobacter. For the endophytes, Acinetobacter, Enterobacter, and Pseudomonas were the abundant genera in the roots, stems and leaves. In the fruits, the bacterial endophytes varied in different compartments, with Enterobacter being enriched in the pericarp and seeds, Acinetobacter in the placenta, and Weissella in the jelly. The present data provide a comprehensive description of the tomato-associated bacterial community and will be useful for better understanding plant-microbe interactions and selecting suitable bacterial taxa for tomato production."
https://openalex.org/W2986476597,"Late-onset sepsis (LOS) is thought to result from systemic spread of commensal microbes from the intestines of premature infants. Clinical use of probiotics for LOS prophylaxis has varied owing to limited efficacy, reflecting an incomplete understanding of relationships between development of the intestinal microbiome, neonatal dysbiosis and LOS. Using a model of LOS, we found that components of the developing microbiome were both necessary and sufficient to prevent LOS. Maternal antibiotic exposure that eradicated or enriched transmission of Lactobacillus murinus exacerbated and prevented disease, respectively. Prophylactic administration of some, but not all Lactobacillus spp. was protective, as was administration of Escherichia coli. Intestinal oxygen level was a major driver of colonization dynamics, albeit via mechanisms distinct from those in adults. These results establish a link between neonatal dysbiosis and LOS, and provide a basis for rational selection of probiotics that modulate primary succession of the microbiome to prevent disease."
https://openalex.org/W2955134440,"Engagement in leisure activities has been claimed to be highly beneficial in the elderly. Practicing such activities is supposed to help older adults to preserve cognitive function, physical function, and mental health, and thus to contribute to successful aging. We used structural equation modeling (SEM) to analyze the impact of leisure activities on these constructs in a large sample of Japanese older adults (N = 809; age range 72–74). The model exhibited an excellent fit (CFI = 1); engaging in leisure activities was positively associated with all the three successful aging indicators. These findings corroborate previous research carried out in Western countries and extend its validity to the population of Eastern older adults. Albeit correlational in nature, these results suggest that active engagement in leisure activities can help older adults to maintain cognitive, physical, and mental health. Future research will clarify whether there is a causal relationship between engagement in leisure activities and successful aging."
https://openalex.org/W2989339557,"Crohn's Disease and Ulcerative Colitis are chronic, inflammatory conditions of the digestive tract, collectively known as Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD). The combined influence of lifestyle factors, genetics, and the gut microbiome contribute to IBD pathogenesis. Studies of the gut microbiome have shown significant differences in its composition between healthy individuals and those with IBD. Due to the high inter-individual microbiome variation seen in humans, mouse models of IBD are often used to investigate potential IBD mechanisms and their interplay between host, microbial, and environmental factors. While fecal samples are the predominant material used for microbial community analysis, they may not be the ideal sample to use for analysis of the microbiome of mice with experimental colitis, such as that induced by 2, 4, 6 trinitrobenzesulfonic acid (TNBS). As TNBS is administered intrarectally to induce colitis and inflammation is confined to the colon in this model, we hypothesized that the microbiome of the colonic mucus would most closely correlate with TNBS colitis severity. Based on our previous research, we also hypothesized that sex would be associated with both disease severity and microbial differences in mice with chronic TNBS colitis. We examined and compared the fecal, cecal content, and colonic mucus microbiota of 8-week old male and female C57BL/6J wild-type mice prior to and after the induction of TNBS colitis via 16S rRNA gene sequencing. We found that the colonic mucus microbiome was more closely correlated with disease severity than were alterations in the fecal and cecal microbiomes. We also found that the microbiomes of the feces, cecum, and mucus were distinct, but found no significant differences that were associated with sex in either compartment. Our findings highlight the importance of sampling colonic mucus in TNBS-induced colitis. Moreover, consideration of the differential impact of sex on the microbiome across mouse strains may be critical for the appropriate application of TNBS colitis models and robust comparisons across studies in the future."
https://openalex.org/W2985431463,"Strong efforts have been made to understand the bacterial communities in potato plants and the rhizosphere. Research has focused on the effect of the environment and plant genotype on bacterial community structures and dynamics, while little is known about the origin and assembly of the bacterial community, especially in potato tubers. The tuber microbiota, however, may be of special interest as it could play an important role in crop quality, such as storage stability. Here, we used 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing to study the bacterial communities that colonize tubers of different potato cultivars commonly used in Austrian potato production over three generations and grown in different soils. Statistical analysis of sequencing data showed that the bacterial community of potato tubers has changed over generations and has become more similar to the soil bacterial community, while the impact of the potato cultivar on the bacterial assemblage has lost significance over time. The communities in different tuber parts did not differ significantly, while the soil bacterial community showed significant differences to the tuber microbiota composition. Additionally, the presence of OTUs in subsequent tuber generation points to vertical transmission of a subset of the tuber microbiota. Four OTUs were common to all tuber generations and all potato varieties. In summary, we conclude that the microbiota of potato tubers is recruited from the soil largely independent from the plant variety. Furthermore, the bacterial assemblage in potato tubers consists of bacteria transmitted from one tuber generation to the next and bacteria recruited from the soil."
https://openalex.org/W2987429305,"Elucidation of the molecular cues required to balance adult stem cell self-renewal and differentiation is critical for advancing cellular therapies. Herein, we report that the hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) self-renewal agonist UM171 triggers a balanced pro- and anti-inflammatory/detoxification network that relies on NFKB activation and protein C receptor-dependent ROS detoxification, respectively. We demonstrate that within this network, EPCR serves as a critical protective component as its deletion hypersensitizes primitive hematopoietic cells to pro-inflammatory signals and ROS accumulation resulting in compromised stem cell function. Conversely, abrogation of the pro-inflammatory activity of UM171 through treatment with dexamethasone, cAMP elevating agents or NFkB inhibitors abolishes EPCR upregulation and HSC expansion. Together, these results show that UM171 stimulates ex vivo HSC expansion by establishing a critical balance between key pro- and anti-inflammatory mediators of self-renewal."
https://openalex.org/W2987921552,"Detection and quantification of microRNAs (miRNAs) in exhaled breath condensate (EBC) has been poorly explored. Therefore we aimed to assess miRNAs in EBC as potential biomarkers to diagnose and endotype asthma in school aged children. In a cross sectional, nested case control study, all the asthmatic children (n = 71) and a random sample of controls (n = 115), aged 7 to 12 years, attending 71 classrooms from 20 local schools were selected and arbitrarily allocated to the development or validation set. Participants underwent skin-prick testing, spirometry with bronchodilation, had exhaled level of nitric oxide determined and EBC collected. Based on previous studies eleven miRNAs were chosen and analyzed in EBC by reverse transcription-quantitative real-time PCR. Principal component analysis was applied to identify miRNAs profiles and associations were estimated using regression models. In the development set (n = 89) two clusters of miRNAs were identified. After adjustments, cluster 1 and three of its clustered miRNAs, miR-126-3p, miR-133a-3p and miR-145-5p were positively associated with asthma. Moreover miR-21-5p was negatively associated with symptomatic asthma and positively associated with positive bronchodilation without symptoms. An association was also found between miR-126-3p, cluster 2 and one of its clustered miRNA, miR-146-5p, with higher FEF25-75 reversibility. These findings were confirmed in the validation set (n = 97) where two identical clusters of miRNAs were identified. Additional significant associations were observed between miR-155-5p with symptomatic asthma, negative bronchodilation with symptoms and positive bronchodilation without symptoms. We showed that microRNAs can be measured in EBC of children and may be used as potential biomarkers of asthma, assisting asthma endotype establishment."
https://openalex.org/W2986082300,"Preterm birth (PTB) is leading contributor to infant death in the United States and globally, yet the underlying mechanistic causes are not well understood. Histopathological studies of preterm birth suggest advanced villous maturity may have a role in idiopathic spontaneous preterm birth (isPTB). To better understand pathological and molecular basis of isPTB, we compared placental villous transcriptomes from carefully phenotyped cohorts of PTB due to infection or isPTB between 28-36 weeks gestation and healthy term placentas. Transcriptomic analyses revealed a unique expression signature for isPTB distinct from the age-matched controls that were delivered prematurely due to infection. This signature included the upregulation of three IGF binding proteins (IGFBP1, IGFBP2, and IGFBP6), supporting a role for aberrant IGF signaling in isPTB. However, within the isPTB expression signature, we detected secondary signature of inflammatory markers including TNC, C3, CFH, and C1R, which have been associated with placental maturity. In contrast, the expression signature of the gestational age-matched infected samples included upregulation of proliferative genes along with cell cycling and mitosis pathways. Together, these data suggest an isPTB molecular signature of placental hypermaturity, likely contributing to the premature activation of inflammatory pathways associated with birth and providing a molecular basis for idiopathic spontaneous birth."
https://openalex.org/W2984298813,"Background & aims MiR-33a has emerged as a critical regulator of lipid homeostasis in the liver. Genetic deficiency of miR-33a aggravates liver steatosis in a preclinical model of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), and relative expression of miR-33a is increased in the livers of patients with non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). It was unknown whether miR-33a is detectable in the serum of patients with NAFLD. We sought to determine whether circulating miR-33a is associated with histological hepatic steatosis, inflammation, ballooning or fibrosis, and whether it could be used as a serum marker in patients with NAFLD/NASH. Methods We analysed circulating miR-33a using quantitative PCR in 116 liver transplant recipients who underwent post-transplant protocol liver biopsy. Regression analysis was used to determine association of serum miR-33a with hepatic steatosis, inflammation, ballooning and fibrosis in liver biopsy. Results Liver graft steatosis and inflammation, but not ballooning or fibrosis, were significantly associated with serum miR-33a, dyslipidemia and insulin resistance markers on univariate analysis. Multivariate analysis showed that steatosis was independently associated with serum miR-33a, ALT, glycaemia and waist circumference, whereas inflammation was independently associated with miR-33a, HbA1 and serum triglyceride levels. Receiver operating characteristic analysis showed that exclusion of serum miR-33a from multivariate analysis resulted in non-significant reduction of prediction model accuracy of liver steatosis or inflammation. Conclusions Our data indicate that circulating miR-33a is an independent predictor of liver steatosis and inflammation in patients after liver transplantation. Although statistically significant, its contribution to the accuracy of prediction model employing readily available clinical and biochemical variables was limited in our cohort."
https://openalex.org/W2985348075,"Several studies have reported mitochondrial dysfunction in rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Many nuclear DNA (nDNA) encoded proteins translocate to mitochondria, but their participation in the dysfunction of this cell organelle during RA is quite unclear. In this study, we have carried out an integrative analysis of gene expression, protein-protein interactions (PPI) and gene ontology data. The analysis has identified potential implications of the nDNA encoded proteins in RA mitochondrial dysfunction. Firstly, by analysing six synovial microarray datasets of RA patients and healthy controls obtained from the gene expression omnibus (GEO) database, we found differentially expressed nDNA genes that encode mitochondrial proteins. We uncovered some of the roles of these genes in RA mitochondrial dysfunction using literature search and gene ontology analysis. Secondly, by employing gene co-expression from microarrays and collating reliable PPI from seven databases, we created the first mitochondrial PPI network that is specific to the RA synovial joint tissue. Further, we identified hubs of this network, and moreover, by integrating gene expression and network analysis, we found differentially expressed neighbours of the hub proteins. The results demonstrate that nDNA encoded proteins are (i) crucial for the elevation of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) and (ii) involved in membrane potential, transport processes, metabolism and intrinsic apoptosis during RA. Additionally, we proposed a model relating to mitochondrial dysfunction and inflammation in the disease. Our analysis presents a novel perspective on the roles of nDNA encoded proteins in mitochondrial dysfunction, especially in apoptosis, oxidative stress-related processes and their relation to inflammation in RA. These findings provide a plethora of information for further research."
https://openalex.org/W2983214690,"Objectives Patient-centred care (PCC) improves multiple patient and health system outcomes. However, many patients do not experience PCC, particularly women, who are faced with disparities in care and outcomes globally. The purpose of this study was to identify if and how guidelines address PCC for women (PCCW). Methods We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, National Guideline Clearing House, and guideline developer websites for publicly-available, English-language guidelines on depression and cardiac rehabilitation, conditions with known gendered inequities. We used summary statistics to report guideline characteristics, clinical topic, mention of PCC according to McCormack’s framework, and mention of women’s health considerations. We appraised guideline quality with the AGREE II instrument. Results A total of 27 guidelines (18 depression, 9 cardiac rehabilitation) were included. All 27 guidelines mentioned at least one PCC domain (median 3, range 1 to 6), most frequently exchanging information (20, 74.1%), making decisions (20, 74.1%), and enabling patient self-management (21, 77.8%). No guidelines fully addressed PCC: 9 (50.0%) of 18 depression guidelines and 3 (33.3%) of 9 cardiac rehabilitation guidelines addressed 4 or more PCC domains. Even when addressed, guidance was minimal and vague. Among 14 (51.9%) guidelines that mentioned women’s health, most referred to social determinants of health; none offered guidance on how to support women impacted by these factors, engage women, or tailor care for women. These findings pertained even to women-specific guidelines. Reported use or type of guideline development process/system did not appear to be linked with PCCW content. Based on quality appraisal with AGREE II, guidelines were either not recommended or recommended with modifications. In particular, the stakeholder involvement AGREE II domain was least addressed, but guidelines that scored higher for stakeholder involvement also appeared to better address PCCW. Implications This research identified opportunities to generate guidelines that achieve PCCW. Strategies include employing a PCC framework, considering gender issues, engaging women on guideline-writing panels, and including patient-oriented tools in guidelines. Primary research is needed to establish what constitutes PCCW."
https://openalex.org/W2985446310,"Western honey bees (Apis mellifera) are important pollinators in natural and agricultural ecosystems, and yet are in significant decline due to several factors including parasites, pathogens, pesticides, and habitat loss. A new beehive construction called the FlowTM hive was developed in 2015 to allow honey to be harvested directly from the hive without opening it, resulting in an apparent decrease in stress to the bees. Here, we compared the Flow and traditional Langstroth hive constructions to determine if there were any significant differences in the bee microbiome. The bee-associated bacterial communities did not differ between hive constructions and varied only slightly over the course of a honey production season. Samples were dominated by taxa belonging to the Lactobacillus, Bifidobacterium, Bartonella, Snodgrassella, Gilliamella, and Frischella genera, as observed in previous studies. The top ten most abundant taxa made up the majority of the sequence data; however, many low abundance organisms were persistent across the majority of samples regardless of sampling time or hive type. We additionally compared different preparations of whole bee and dissected bee samples to elaborate on previous bee microbiome research. We found that bacterial sequences were overwhelming derived from the bee guts, and microbes on the bee surfaces (including pollen) contributed little to the overall microbiome of whole bees. Overall, the results indicate that different hive constructions and associated disturbance levels do not influence the bee gut microbiome, which has broader implications for supporting hive health."
https://openalex.org/W2982780088,"Background Our primary study aimed to explore the experiences of men who have sex with men (MSM) recently diagnosed with HIV and their partner notification practices. Themes relating to acceptance, and disclosure of, their HIV status strongly emerged during analysis in our larger study and are reported separately here. Method Fifteen MSM participated in semi-structured interviews by phone or face to face about their experience of a recent HIV diagnosis. In this paper we report on how they received and accepted the diagnosis, who they disclosed their diagnosis to and what is needed to improve support for MSM recently diagnosed with HIV. Results MSM’s reactions to their HIV diagnosis ranged from shock, devastation and anger to a calm acceptance and feeling HIV would not have a significant impact on their lives. MSM who reported strong social support networks, or knew others with HIV, seemed better able to cope with and accept their diagnosis than those with fewer support networks. Due to prevailing stigma around HIV, most MSM were very selective about who they disclosed their status to, often only telling partners perceived to be at risk but no, or only few, close friends. Regardless of how well men accepted their diagnosis, most did not disclose their status to family members for fear of rejection or causing distress due to ideologies based on outdated information about HIV. Conclusion The prevailing stigma around HIV can have a significant impact on MSM’s acceptance of, and willingness to disclose their HIV serostatus to others, and consequently the levels of professional and social support they receive. HIV-related stigma needs to be addressed through community campaigns which better educate the wider population about the current state of HIV prognosis and treatment."
https://openalex.org/W2983533943,"Introduction Thrombospondin-4 [1] is an extracellular glycoprotein involved in wound healing and tissue remodeling. Although THBS4 is reportedly frequently expressed in solid tumors, there are few reports of the clinicopathological features of carcinomas with THBS4 expression. We evaluated the clinicopathologic significance of THBS4 expression in gastric carcinoma (GC). Materials and methods We retrospectively analyzed the cases of 584 GC patients. The expression of THBS4 in each tumor was evaluated by immunohistochemistry. We then divided the patients into the THBS4-high (n = 223, 38.2%) group and THBS4-low (n = 361, 61.8%) group. THBS4 expression in cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), normal-associated fibroblasts (NFs) and gastric cancer cell lines was examined by western blotting. Results THBS4 is expressed on stromal cells with αSMA or Podoplanin expression in the GC microenvironment, but not expressed on cancer cells with cytokeratin expression. The western blot analysis results showed that CAFs (but not NFs and cancer cells) expressed THBS4. Compared to the THBS4-low expression status, the THBS4-high expression status was correlated with higher αSMA expression, higher invasion depth, lymph-node metastasis, lymphatic invasion, peritoneal cytology, peritoneal metastasis, larger tumor size, microscopic diffuse type, and the macroscopic diffuse infiltrating type. The THBS4-high group's 5-year overall survival rate was significantly poorer than that of the THBS4-low group. A multivariate analysis revealed that THBS4 expression was an independent prognostic factor. Conclusion THBS4 is expressed on CAFs in the gastric cancer microenvironment. THBS4 from CAFs is associated with the metastasis of cancer cells, and is a useful prognostic indicator for gastric cancer patients."
https://openalex.org/W2986696185,"Information about the tissue characteristics of abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs), some of which may be reflected in the serum, can help to elucidate AAA pathogenesis and identify new AAA biomarkers. This information would be beneficial not only for diagnostics and follow-up but also for potential therapeutic intervention. Therefore, the aim of our study was to compare the expression of structural proteins, immune factors (T and B lymphocytes, macrophages, neutrophils and pentraxin 3 (PTX3)), osteoprotegerin (OPG), microvessels and hypoxic cells in AAA and nonaneurysmal aortic walls. We examined specimens collected during surgery for AAA repair (n = 39) and from the abdominal aortas of kidney donors without AAA (n = 8). Using histochemical and immunohistochemical methods, we quantified the areas positive for smooth muscle actin, desmin, elastin, collagen, OPG, CD3, CD20, MAC387, myeloperoxidase, PTX3, and hypoxia-inducible factor 1-alpha and the density of CD31-positive microvessels. AAA samples contained significantly less actin, desmin, elastin and OPG, more collagen, macrophages, neutrophils, T lymphocytes, B lymphocytes, hypoxic cells and PTX3, and a greater density of vasa vasorum (VV) than those in non-AAA samples. Hypoxia positively correlated with actin and negatively correlated with collagen. Microvascular density was related to inflammatory cell infiltrates, hypoxia, PTX3 expression and AAA diameter. The lower OPG expression in AAAs supports the notion of its protective role in AAA remodeling. AAA contained altered amounts of structural proteins, implying reduced vascular elasticity. PTX3 was upregulated in AAA and colocalized with inflammatory infiltrates. This evidence supports further evaluation of PTX3 as a candidate marker of AAA. The presence of aortic hypoxia, despite hypervascularization, suggests that hypoxia-induced neoangiogenesis may play a role in AAA pathogenesis. VV angiogenesis of the AAA wall increases its vulnerability."
https://openalex.org/W2988234168,"Metformin is a commonly used antihyperglycaemic agent for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus. Nevertheless, the exact mechanisms of action, underlying the various therapeutic effects of metformin, remain elusive. The goal of this study was to evaluate the alterations in longitudinal whole-blood transcriptome profiles of healthy individuals after a one-week metformin intervention in order to identify the novel molecular targets and further prompt the discovery of predictive biomarkers of metformin response. Next generation sequencing-based transcriptome analysis revealed metformin-induced differential expression of genes involved in intestinal immune network for IgA production and cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction pathways. Significantly elevated faecal sIgA levels during administration of metformin, and its correlation with the expression of genes associated with immune response (CXCR4, HLA-DQA1, MAP3K14, TNFRSF21, CCL4, ACVR1B, PF4, EPOR, CXCL8) supports a novel hypothesis of strong association between metformin and intestinal immune system, and for the first time provide evidence for altered RNA expression as a contributing mechanism of metformin’s action. In addition to universal effects, 4 clusters of functionally related genes with a subject-specific differential expression were distinguished, including genes relevant to insulin production (HNF1B, HNF1A, HNF4A, GCK, INS, NEUROD1, PAX4, PDX1, ABCC8, KCNJ11) and cholesterol homeostasis (APOB, LDLR, PCSK9). This inter-individual variation of the metformin effect on the transcriptional regulation goes in line with well-known variability of the therapeutic response to the drug."
https://openalex.org/W2989220589,"Fibrin sealants are commonly used in cartilage repair surgeries to adhere cells or grafts into a cartilage defect. Both autologous and commercial allogeneic fibrin sealants are used in cartilage repair surgeries, yet there are no studies characterizing and comparing the mechanical properties of fibrin sealants from all-autologous sources. The objectives of this study were to investigate (i) the effect of fibrinogen and thrombin sources on failure mechanics of sealants, and (ii) how sealants affect the adhesion of particulated cartilage graft material (BioCartilage) to surrounding cartilage under physiological loading. Allogeneic thrombin and fibrinogen were purchased (Tisseel), and autologous sources were prepared from platelet-rich plasma (PRP) and platelet-poor plasma (PPP) generated from human blood. To compare failure characteristics, sealants were sandwiched between cartilage explants and pulled to failure. The effect of sealant on the adhesion of BioCartilage graft to cartilage was determined by quantifying microscale strains at the graft-cartilage interface using an in vitro cartilage defect model subjected to shear loading at physiological strains well below failure thresholds. Fibrinogen sources were not equivalent; PRP fibrinogen created sealants that were more brittle, failed at lower strains, and resulted in sustained higher strains through the graft-cartilage interface depth compared to PPP and allogeneic sources. PPP clotted slower compared to PRP, suggesting PPP may percolate deeper into the repair to provide more stability through the tissue depth. There was no difference in bulk failure properties or microscale strains at the graft-cartilage interface between the purely autologous sealant (autologous thrombin + PPP fibrinogen) and the commercial allogeneic sealant. Clinical Significance: All-autologous fibrin sealants fabricated with PPP have comparable adhesion strength as commercial allogeneic sealants in vitro, whereas PRP creates an inferior all-autologous sealant that sustains higher strains through the graft-cartilage interface depth."
https://openalex.org/W2989556370,"The aim of this retrospective study was to explore the risk factors and clinical characteristics related to neonatal fulminant necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC). From 1 November 2007 to 31 October 2017, 352 neonates who were diagnosed with NEC (Bell stage ≥ΠB) and admitted to the Children’s Hospital of Chongqing Medical University were enrolled. Among these patients, 112 (31.82%) cases fulfilled the definition of fulminant NEC, and 62.5% (70/112) of fulminant cases presented a poor prognosis. All the survivors in the fulminant NEC group underwent surgery. Those in the fulminant NEC group were more likely to have the following clinical features: sepsis preceding NEC (P<0.001), abdominal distention (P<0.001), bowel sound disappearance (P = 0.001), leukopenia or neutropenia (P<0.001), C-reactive protein (CRP) <10 mg/L (P = 0.003), procalcitonin (PCT) < 2 μg/L (P<0.001), pH ≤7.2 (P<0.001), and radiographic evidence of pneumoperitoneum (P<0.001) or seroperitoneum on ultrasonography (P = 0.017). In conclusion, fulminant NEC is characterized by urgent onset and prompt deterioration, potentially resulting in death. The lack of unique characteristics makes it difficult to recognize by medical caregivers. Close observation, early detection and timely surgical intervention may improve the prognosis."
https://openalex.org/W2987420928,"The interactions between pairs of native and alien plants via shared use of pollinators have been widely studied. Community level studies however, are necessary in order to fully understand the factors and mechanisms that facilitate successful plant invasion, but these are still scarce. Specifically, few community level studies have considered how differences in invasion level (alien flower abundance), and degree of floral trait similarity between native and invasive species, mediate effects on native plant-pollinator communities. Here, we evaluated the role of alien species on overall plant-floral visitor network structure, and on species-level network parameters, across nine invaded coastal communities distributed along 205 km in Yucatán, México that vary in alien species richness and flower abundance. We further assessed the potential the role of alien plant species on plant-floral visitor network structure and robustness via computational simulation of native and invasive plant extinction scenarios. We did not find significant differences between native and alien species in their functional floral phenotypes or in their visitation rate and pollinator community composition in these invaded sites. Variation in the proportion of alien plant species and flower abundance across sites did not influence plant-pollinator network structure. Species-level network parameters (i.e., normalized degree and nestedness contribution) did not differ between native and alien species. Furthermore, our simulation analyses revealed that alien species are functionally equivalent to native species and contribute equally to network structure and robustness. Overall, our results suggest that high levels of floral trait similarity and pollinator use overlap may help facilitate the integration of alien species into native plant-pollinator networks. As a result, alien species may also play a similar role than that of natives in the structure and stability of native plant and pollinator communities in the studied coastal sand dune ecosystem."
https://openalex.org/W2983358385,"We investigated a potential use of a 3D tetraculture brain microphysiological system (BMPS) for neurotoxic chemical agent screening. This platform consists of neuronal tissue with extracellular matrix (ECM)-embedded neuroblastoma cells, microglia, and astrocytes, and vascular tissue with dynamic flow and membrane-free culture of the endothelial layer. We tested the broader applicability of this model, focusing on organophosphates (OPs) Malathion (MT), Parathion (PT), and Chlorpyrifos (CPF), and chemicals that interact with GABA and/or opioid receptor systems, including Muscimol (MUS), Dextromethorphan (DXM), and Ethanol (EtOH). We validated the BMPS platform by measuring the neurotoxic effects on barrier integrity, acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibition, viability, and residual OP concentration. The results show that OPs penetrated the model blood brain barrier (BBB) and inhibited AChE activity. DXM, MUS, and EtOH also penetrated the BBB and induced moderate toxicity. The results correlate well with available in vivo data. In addition, simulation results from an in silico physiologically-based pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PBPK/PD) model that we generated show good agreement with in vivo and in vitro data. In conclusion, this paper demonstrates the potential utility of a membrane-free tetraculture BMPS that can recapitulate brain complexity as a cost-effective alternative to animal models."
https://openalex.org/W2983648639,"Male-specifically inherited Y-STRs, harboring the features of haploidy and lack of crossing over, have gained considerable attention in population genetics and forensic investigations. Goldeneye® Y-PLUS kit was a recently developed amplification system focused on the genetic diversity of 36 Y-chromosomal short tandem repeats (Y-STRs) in East Asians. However, no population data and corresponding forensic features were reported in China. Here, 36 Y-STRs were first genotyped in 400 unrelated healthy Tai-Kadai-speaking Bouyei male individuals. A total of 371 alleles and 396 haplotypes could be detected, and the allelic frequencies ranged from 0.0025 to 0.9875. The haplotype diversity, random match probability and discrimination capacity values were 0.9999, 0.0026 and 0.9900, respectively. The gene diversity (GD) of 36 Y-STR loci in the studied group ranged from 0.0248 (DYS645) to 0.9601 (DYS385a/b). Population comparisons between the Guizhou Bouyei and 80 reference groups were performed via the AMOVA, MDS, and phylogenetic relationship reconstruction. The results showed that the population stratification was almost consistent with the geographic distribution and language-family, both among Chinese and worldwide ethnic groups. Our newly genotyped Bouyei samples show a close affinity with other Tai-Kadai-speaking groups in China and Southeast Asia. Our data may provide useful information for paternal lineage in the forensic application and population genetics, as well as evidence for archaeological and historical research."
https://openalex.org/W2987780084,"This study assessed the satisfaction of patients receiving antiretroviral treatment (ART) in Vietnam and its multilevel predictors. Cross-sectional data were collected from January to September 2013 in eight outpatient clinics in Hanoi and Nam Dinh provinces. Patient satisfaction was evaluated using the Satisfaction with HIV/AIDS Treatment Interview Scale. Multivariable Tobit regression was utilized to measure the associations between these factors and satisfaction with treatment services. Generalized Mixed-effect Regression model was used to estimate the effect of satisfaction with the quality of service on the change between the initial and the latest CD4 cell count. Among 1133 patients, most of them were completely satisfied with the 10 domains measured (65.5% to 82.5%). “Service quality and convenience” domain which was attributed by the waiting time and administrative procedure had the lowest score of complete satisfaction. Compared to central clinics, provincial clinics were negatively associated with the overall satisfaction (Coef = -0.58; 95%CI = -0.95; -0.21). Patients rating higher score in “Consultation, explanation, and guidance of health care workers”, “Responsiveness of health care workers to patients’ questions and requests” and “Perceived overall satisfaction with the quality of service” were related to improvement in immunological treatment outcomes. Our results revealed the high level of satisfaction among ART patients towards HIV care and treatment services, and this had a high correlation to treatment outcomes. Interventions should focus on reducing administrative procedures, providing sufficient guidance and comprehensive services which integrate physical with psychological care for improving the health outcome of the ART program."
https://openalex.org/W2989476126,"The apoptosis-inducing peptide kla (KLAKLAK)2 possesses the ability to disrupt mitochondrial membranes and induce cancer cell apoptosis, but this peptide has a poor eukaryotic cell-penetrating potential. Thus, it requires the assistance of other peptides for effective translocation at micromolar concentrations. In this study, breast and lung cancer cells were treated by kla peptide co-administrated with membrane-active anticancer peptide HPRP-A1. HPRP-A1 assisted kla to enter cancer cells and localized on mitochondrial membranes to result in cytochrome C releasing and mitochondrial depolarization which ultimately induced apoptosis.The apoptosis rate was up to 65%and 45% on MCF-7 and A549 cell lines, respectively, induced by HPRP-A1 coadministration with kla group. The breast cancer model was constructed in mice, and the anticancer peptides were injected to observe the changes in cancer volume, andimmunohistochemical analysis was performed on the tissues and organs after the drug was administered. Both the weight and volume of tumor tissue were remarkable lower in HPRP-A1 with kla group compared with thosepeptidealonggroups. The results showed that the combined drug group effectively inhibited the growth of cancer and did not cause toxic damage to normal tissues, as well as exhibited significantly improvement on peptide anticancer activity in vitro and in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W2983199620,"In this article we discuss the five yearly screenings for publications in questionable journals which have been carried out in the context of the performance-based research funding model in Flanders, Belgium. The Flemish funding model expanded from 2010 onwards, with a comprehensive bibliographic database for research output in the social sciences and humanities. Along with an overview of the procedures followed during the screenings for articles in questionable journals submitted for inclusion in this database, we present a bibliographic analysis of the publications identified. First, we show how the yearly number of publications in questionable journals has evolved over the period 2003–2016. Second, we present a disciplinary classification of the identified journals. In the third part of the results section, three authorship characteristics are discussed: multi-authorship, the seniority–or experience level–of authors in general and of the first author in particular, and the relation of the disciplinary scope of the journal (cognitive classification) with the departmental affiliation of the authors (organizational classification). Our results regarding yearly rates of publications in questionable journals indicate that awareness of the risks of questionable journals does not lead to a turn away from open access in general. The number of publications in open access journals rises every year, while the number of publications in questionable journals decreases from 2012 onwards. We find further that both early career and more senior researchers publish in questionable journals. We show that the average proportion of senior authors contributing to publications in questionable journals is somewhat higher than that for publications in open access journals. In addition, this paper yields insight into the extent to which publications in questionable journals pose a threat to the public and political legitimacy of a performance-based research funding system of a western European region. We include concrete suggestions for those tasked with maintaining bibliographic databases and screening for publications in questionable journals."
https://openalex.org/W2989508940,"The infiltration of stormwater runoff for use by urban trees is a major co-benefit of green infrastructure for desert cities with limited water resources. However, the effects of this passive irrigation versus regular, controlled moisture inputs, or active irrigation, is largely unquantified. We monitored the ecohydrology of urban mesquite trees (Prosopis spp.) under these contrasting irrigation regimes in semiarid Tucson, AZ. Measurements included soil moisture, sap velocity, canopy greenness, and leaf-area index. We expected both irrigation types to provide additional deep (>20 cm) soil moisture compared to natural conditions, and that trees would depend on this deep moisture for transpiration and phenological activity. Results show that active irrigation supported higher soil moisture throughout the study than passive irrigation. Passive irrigation only provided additional deep moisture when green infrastructure features received impervious runoff from a city street. Sap velocity and greenness were similar under both irrigation types, outside of isolated periods of time. These differences occurred during the extremely wet summer 2017 when passively irrigated trees exhibited a greenness peak, and the dry conditions of spring when actively irrigated trees had higher sap flow and relative greenness. Finally, it was not determined that deep soil moisture had a stronger relationship with mesquite productivity than shallow moisture, but both relationships were stronger in the spring, before summer rains. This study aims to contribute empirical observations of green infrastructure performance for urban watershed management."
https://openalex.org/W2984432550,"Background Olfactory testing is a useful tool in the differential diagnosis of Parkinson’s Disease (PD). Although fast and easy to use, the high intercultural variability of odor detection limits the world-wide use of the most common test sets. Objective The aim of this study was to test one of the most commonly used olfactory tests (Sniffin’ Sticks 12-identification test) in an adapted version for a Chinese population of healthy subjects and PD patients. Methods For this purpose, cohorts of 39 Chinese and 41 German PD patients as well as 70 Chinese and 100 German healthy subjects have been examined both with the original and the adapted version of the Sniffin’ Sticks test, the latter being designed according to the regional culture. Results The adapted Chinese version of the Sniffin’ Sticks 12 identification test proved to discriminate Chinese PD patients from controls with a high specificity but relatively low sensitivity. Yet not all odor exchanges would have been necessary as the original odors including liquorice and coffee showed an equally high identification rate in the Chinese and German cohorts. Conclusions The results showed that the newly adapted test could be used as a screening test for PD related olfactory dysfunction in a Chinese population. However further investigation will be necessary to optimize the selection of odors for the Chinese version of the test."
https://openalex.org/W2986481308,"Rocky outcrops covered with thick Fe and Mn oxide coatings, which are known as ferromanganese (Fe-Mn) crusts, are commonly found on slopes of aged seamounts in bathyal and abyssal zones. Although the presence of diverse microorganisms on these Fe-Mn crusts has been reported, little is known about their metabolism. Here, we report the metabolic potential of the microbial community in an abyssal crust collected in the Takuyo-Daigo Seamount, in the north-western Pacific. We performed shotgun metagenomic sequencing of the Fe-Mn crust, and detected putative genes involved in dissolution and precipitation of Fe and Mn, nitrification, sulfur oxidation, carbon fixation, and decomposition of organics in the metagenome. In addition, four metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) of abundant members in the microbial community were recovered from the metagenome. The MAGs were affiliated with Thaumarchaeota, Alphaproteobacteria, and Gammaproteobacteria, and were distantly related to previously reported genomes/MAGs of cultured and uncultured species. Putative genes involved in the above reactions were also found in the crust MAGs. Our results suggest that crust microbial communities play a role in biogeochemical cycling of C, N, S, Fe, and Mn, and imply that they contribute to the growth of Fe-Mn crusts."
https://openalex.org/W2985666443,"In the anaerobic process, fat-oil-grease (FOG) is hydrolysed to long-chain fatty acids (LCFAs) and glycerol (GLYC), which are then used as substrates to produce biogas. The increase in FOG and LCFAs inhibits methanogenesis, and so far, most work investigating this inhibition has been carried out when FOG or LCFAs were used as co-substrates. In the current work, the inhibition of methanogenesis by FOG, LCFAs and GLYC was investigated when used as sole substrates. To gain more insight on the dynamics of this process, the change of microbial community was analysed using 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing. The results indicate that, as the concentrations of cooking olive oil (CO, which represents FOG) and LCFAs increase, methanogenesis is inhibited. For instance, at 0.01 g. L-1 of FOG, the rate of biogas formation was around 8 ml.L-1.day-1, and this decreased to <4 ml.L-1.day-1 at 40 g.L-1. Similar results were observed with the use of LCFAs. However, GLYC concentrations up to 100g.L-1 did not affect the rate of biogas formation. Acidic pH, temperature > = 45°C and NaCl > 3% led to a significant decrease in the rate of biogas formation. Microbial community analyses were carried out from samples from 3 different bioreactors (CO, OLEI and GLYC), on day 1, 5 and 15. In each bioreactor, microbial communities were dominated by Proteobacteria, Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes phyla. The most important families were Enterobacteriaceae, Pseudomonadaceae and Shewanellaceae (Proteobacteria phylum), Clostridiacea and Ruminococcaceae (Firmicutes) and Porphyromonadaceae and Bacteroidaceae (Bacteroidetes). In CO bioreactor, Proteobacteria bacteria decreased over time, while those of OLEI and GLYC bioreactors increased. A more pronounced increase in Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes were observed in CO bioreactor. The methanogenic archaea Methanobacteriaceae and Methanocorpusculaceae were identified. This analysis has shown that a set of microbial population is selected as a function of the substrate."
https://openalex.org/W2984336474,"USP14 is a cysteine protease deubiquitinase associated with the proteasome and plays important catalytic and allosteric roles in proteasomal degradation. USP14 inhibition has been considered a therapeutic strategy for accelerating degradation of aggregation-prone proteins in neurodegenerative diseases and for inhibiting proteasome function to induce apoptotic cell death in cancers. Here we studied the effects of USP14 inhibition in mammalian cells using small molecule inhibitors and an inactive USP14 mutant C114A. Neither the inhibitors nor USP14 C114A showed consistent or significant effects on the level of TDP-43, tau or α-synuclein in HEK293T cells. However, USP14 C114A led to a robust accumulation of ubiquitinated proteins, which were isolated by ubiquitin immunoprecipitation and identified by mass spectrometry. Among these proteins we confirmed that ubiquitinated β-catenin accumulated in the cells expressing USP14 C114A with immunoblotting and immunoprecipitation experiments. The proteasome binding domain of USP14 C114A is required for its effect on ubiquitinated proteins. UCHL5 is the other cysteine protease deubiquitinase associated with the proteasome. Interestingly, the inactive mutant of UCHL5 C88A also caused an accumulation of ubiquitinated proteins in HEK293T cells but did not affect β-catenin, demonstrating USP14 but not UCHL5 has a specific effect on β-catenin. We used ubiquitin immunoprecipitation and mass spectrometry to identify the accumulated ubiquitinated proteins in UCHL5 C88A expressing cells which are mostly distinct from those identified in USP14 C114A expressing cells. Among the identified proteins are well established proteasome substrates and proteasome subunits. Besides β-catenin, we also verified with immunoblotting that UCHL5 C88A inhibits its own deubiquitination and USP14 C114A inhibits deubiquitination of two proteasomal subunits PSMC1 and PSMD4. Together our data suggest that USP14 and UCHL5 can deubiquitinate distinct substrates at the proteasome and regulate the ubiquitination of the proteasome itself which is tightly linked to its function."
https://openalex.org/W2987688213,"Autophagy is an essential process involved in the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Although there are many data showing the roles of autophagy in intestinal epithelial cells (IECs), the mechanisms involved remain to be fully elucidated. We investigated the influence of autophagy in IECs on gastrointestinal tract inflammation.Mice with conditional knockout of Atg5 in IECs (Atg5flox/flox/villin-Cre mice) were subjected to dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced colitis and analyzed for colitis susceptibility. Additionally, we used Atg5-silenced rat IECs (IEC6shAtg5 cells) for in vitro assays.Sensitivity to DSS markedly increased in Atg5flox/flox/villin-Cre mice compared to that in wild-type mice. In IEC6shAtg5 cells, apoptosis was enhanced, and cell viability significantly decreased compared to IEC-6 cells. The expression of proinflammatory cytokines increased upon suppression of autophagy. Furthermore, silencing of Atg5 was associated with inflammation of IECs, activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway by the intracellular reactive oxygen species accumulation, and NF-κB p65 phosphorylation.Autophagy in IECs plays an essential role in the maintenance of intestinal homeostasis, and autophagy deficiency triggers inflammation. Development of methods targeting autophagy might be beneficial in the treatment of IBD."
https://openalex.org/W2989011060,"Leptin and adiponectin are important regulators of energy metabolism and body composition. Leptin exerts cardiodepressive effects, whereas adiponectin has cardioprotective effects, but several conflicting findings have been reported. The aim of the present study was to assess the relationship between serum leptin and adiponectin levels and echocardiographic parameters and pathophysiological states in patients with cardiovascular disease (CVD) receiving cardiovascular surgery. A total of 128 patients (79 males, average age 69.6 years) that had surgery for CVD including coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) and valve replacement were recruited in this study. Preoperative serum adiponectin and leptin concentrations were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and compared with preoperative echocardiographic findings. Body fat volume and skeletal muscle volume index (SMI) were estimated using bioelectrical impedance analysis. We also measured grip strength and gait speed. Sarcopenia was diagnosed based on the recommendations of the Asian Working Group on Sarcopenia. Positive correlations were found between adiponectin and brain natriuretic peptide (BNP), age, left atrial diameter (LAD), E/e' (early-diastolic left ventricular inflow velocity / early-diastolic mitral annular velocity), and left atrial volume index (LAVI). Negative correlations were observed between adiponectin and body mass index (BMI), estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), triglyceride, hemoglobin, and albumin. Serum leptin was positively correlated with BMI, total cholesterol, triglyceride, albumin, body fat volume, and LV ejection fraction (LVEF), whereas it was negatively correlated with BNP and echocardiographic parameters (LAD, LV mass index (LVMI), and LAVI). Multiple regression analysis showed associations between log (leptin) and log (adiponectin) and echocardiographic parameters after adjusting for age, sex, and BMI. Serum adiponectin was negatively correlated with leptin, but positively correlated with tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα), an inflammatory cytokine. In males, serum leptin level had a positive correlation with skeletal muscle volume and SMI. However, adiponectin had a negative correlation with anterior mid-thigh muscle thickness, skeletal muscle volume and SMI. And, it was an independent predictive factor in males for sarcopenia even after adjusted by age. These results suggest that leptin and adiponectin may play a role in cardiac remodeling in CVD patients receiving cardiovascular surgery. And, adiponectin appears to be a marker of impaired metabolic signaling that is linked to heart failure progression including inflammation, poor nutrition, and muscle wasting in CVD patients receiving cardiovascular surgery."
https://openalex.org/W2982962028,"Agricultural intensification during the last century has caused river degradation across Europe. From the wide range of stressors derived from agricultural activities that impact rivers, diffuse agricultural pollution has received most of the attention from managers and scientists. The aim of this study was to determine the main stressors exerted by intensive agriculture on streams around Nitrate Vulnerable Zones (NVZs), which are areas of land that drain into waters polluted by nitrates according to the European Nitrate Directive (91/676/EEC). The study area was located in the NW of La Rioja (Northern Spain), which has some of the highest nitrate concentrations within the Ebro basin. The relationships between 40 environmental variables and the taxonomic and functional characteristics of the macroinvertebrate assemblages (which are useful indicators of water quality) were analyzed in 11 stream reaches differentially affected by upstream agricultural activity. The streams affected by a greater percentage of agricultural land cover in the surrounding catchment had significantly higher nitrate concentrations than the remaining sites. However, hydromorphological alteration (i.e. channel simplification, riparian forest and habitat degradation), which is closely linked to agricultural practices, was the main factor affecting macroinvertebrate assemblages. We suggest that ""good agricultural practices"" should be implemented in streams affected by NVZs to reverse stream degradation, in concordance with the European Water Framework Directive (WFD)."
https://openalex.org/W2984687933,"Autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (auto-HSCT) provides a potentially curative treatment option for relapsed and refractory lymphomas. Obesity displays an emerging epidemic risk factor for global mortality and is associated with an increased mortality in cancer patients. To date, the impact of obesity on the outcome of lymphoma patients undergoing auto-HSCT is understudied. We conducted a retrospective single-center study assessing 119 lymphoma patients who underwent auto-HSCT. Overall survival (OS) served as the primary endpoint whereas progression free survival (PFS), cumulative incidence of non-relapse related mortality (NRM) and cumulative incidence of relapse were analyzed as secondary endpoints. Obese patients (Body mass index, BMI≥30) had significantly lower OS (45.3% vs. 77.9%; p = 0.005) and PFS (29.8% vs. 67.2%; p<0.001) compared to non-obese patients at 48 months post-transplantation. The cumulative incidence of NRM displayed no significant differences while the cumulative incidence of relapse was significantly increased in patients with BMI≥30 (66.2% vs. 21.5%; p<0.001). Patients with a BMI<25 and overweight patients (BMI 25–30; 76.1% vs. 80.9%; p = 0.585), showed no significant difference in OS, whereas patients with BMI≥30 exhibited significant lower OS when compared to either of both groups (76.1% vs. 45.3%; p = .0.021 and 80.9% vs. 45.3%; p = 0.010). Furthermore, in a multivariate analysis, obesity was identified as an independent risk factor for death (Hazard ratio 2.231; 95% CI 1.024 to 4.860; p = 0.043). Further studies are needed to evaluate the reasons for the higher relapse rate causing higher mortality in obese patients."
https://openalex.org/W2988701495,"Background Psychological distress is an undifferentiated combination of symptoms that may be related to the occurrence of angina pectoris (AP). However, few studies have investigated the relationship between psychological distress and AP, particularly in Asian populations. The purpose of this study was to examine the relationship between psychological distress and AP in Taiwanese adults. Methods We adopted a cross-sectional design to explore the data of the 2005–2008 Nutrition and Health Survey in Taiwan. In total, 2080 subjects (aged ≥ 19 years) responded to questionnaire interviews and underwent physical examinations. Each of the five dimensions of psychological distress (sleep disturbance, anxiety, hostility, depression, and feelings of inferiority) were scored (from 0–20) according to the Five-Item Brief Symptom Rating Scale (BSRS-5). A score ≥ 6 points indicated psychological distress. AP was evaluated using a modified Rose questionnaire. Findings In total, 102 subjects (3.6%) had AP, and 231 subjects (8.8%) had symptoms of psychological distress. After adjusting for the basic data, metabolism, and lifestyle covariates, the BSRS-5 total score was associated with AP (odds ratio [OR] = 1.2, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.13–1.26, p < 0.001). Subjects with psychological distress had a higher risk of AP (OR = 2.97, 95% CI = 1.76–4.99, p < 0.001). Conclusions The presence of AP is associated with psychological distress. Health care providers should therefore be aware of the impact of psychological distress on AP. Our study findings can serve as a reference for AP assessments. Large scale longitudinal studies are needed to confirm a causal relationship between psychological distress and AP."
https://openalex.org/W2985707900,"Chicken mitochondrial DNA is a circular molecule comprising ~16.8 kb. In this study, we used next-generation sequencing to investigate mitochondrial heteroplasmy in the whole chicken mitochondrial genome. Based on heteroplasmic detection thresholds at the 0.5% level, 178 cases of heteroplasmy were identified in the chicken mitochondrial genome, where 83% were due to nucleotide transitions. D-loop regionwas hot spot region for mtDNA heteroplasmy in the chicken since 130 cases of heteroplasmy were located in these regions. Heteroplasmy varied among intraindividual tissues with allele-specific, position-specific, and tissue-specific features. Skeletal muscle had the highest abundance of heteroplasmy. Cases of heteroplasmy at mt.G8682A and mt.G16121A were validated by PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis, which showed that both had low ratios of heteroplasmy occurrence in five natural breeds. Polymorphic sites were easy to distinguish. Based on NGS data for crureus tissues, mitochondrial mutation/heteroplasmy exhibited clear maternal inheritance features at the whole mitochondrial genomic level. Further investigations of the heterogeneity of the mt.A5694T and mt.T5718G transitions between generations using pyrosequencing based on pedigree information indicated that the degree of heteroplasmy and the occurrence ratio of heteroplasmy decreased greatly from the F0 to F1 generations in the mt.A5694T and mt.T5718G site. Thus, the intergenerational transmission of heteroplasmy in chicken mtDNA exhibited a rapid shift toward homoplasmy within a single generation. Our findings indicate that heteroplasmy is a widespread phenomenon in chicken mitochondrial genome, in which most sites exhibit low heteroplasmy and the allele frequency at heteroplasmic sites changes significantly during transmission events. It suggests that heteroplasmy may be under negative selection to some degree in the chicken."
https://openalex.org/W2986505809,"Background The development of an effective preventive HIV vaccine is the best-known option to halt incident HIV infections. Participants in HIV vaccine trials may possess expectations shaped by existing socio-cultural contexts that are important to understand to allow for improved trial design. Here, we describe post-phase I/II HIV vaccine trial perceptions within participating communities in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. Materials and methods This descriptive qualitative study was conducted in May 2016. We conducted eight focus group discussions, each consisting of 5 to 12 participants. Four groups comprised of the past phase I/II HIV vaccine trial participants and four groups involved those who did not participate. We used a thematic analysis approach. Results Ongoing concerns existed among non-vaccine trial participants who believed that those who participated in HIV vaccine trials were infected with HIV. Limited post-HIV vaccine trial result dissemination, the pre-existing negative beliefs about vaccines, and experiences from other previous medical experiments fueled these concerns. The participants anticipated that broader dissemination of facts regarding HIV vaccine trials using media, former volunteers, and flyers would reduce the reported concerns. In contrast, some participants embraced the benefits gained through participating in HIV vaccine trials. HIV vaccine trial participants appreciated trial interventions, such as health status check-ups, knowledge acquisition, and facilitation of access to medical services. They envisioned mutual benefits in the form of community protection and capacity building among the local scientists. Conclusions The future conduct of HIV vaccine trials in Tanzania requires wider community dissemination of information and post-trial feedback to alleviate concerns among the participating communities. Interventions such as medical services may represent essential incentives to the HIV vaccine trial volunteers. In future HIV vaccine trials, it is crucial to boost individual and perceived mutual benefits."
https://openalex.org/W2979721100,"Metagenomic sequencing of fecal DNA can usefully characterise an individual’s intestinal resistome but is limited by its inability to detect important pathogens that may be present at low abundance, such as carbapenemase or extended-spectrum beta-lactamase producing Enterobacteriaceae. Here we aimed to develop a hybrid protocol to improve detection of resistance genes in Enterobacteriaceae by using a short period of culture enrichment prior to sequencing of DNA extracted directly from the enriched sample. Volunteer feces were spiked with carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae and incubated in selective broth culture for 6 hours before sequencing. Different DNA extraction methods were compared, including a plasmid extraction protocol to increase the detection of plasmid-associated resistance genes. Although enrichment prior to sequencing increased the detection of carbapenemase genes, the differing growth characteristics of the spike organisms precluded accurate quantification of their concentration prior to culture. Plasmid extraction increased detection of resistance genes present on plasmids, but the effects were heterogeneous and dependent on plasmid size. Our results demonstrate methods of improving the limit of detection of selected resistance mechanisms in a fecal resistome assay, but they also highlight the difficulties in using these techniques for accurate quantification and should inform future efforts to achieve this goal."
https://openalex.org/W2985911970,"The spectral reflectance function of a surface specifies the fraction of the illumination reflected by it at each wavelength. Jointly with the illumination spectral density, this function determines the apparent colour of the surface. Models for the distribution of spectral reflectance functions in the natural environment are considered. The realism of the models is assessed in terms of the individual reflectance functions they generate, and in terms of the overall distribution of colours which they give rise to. Both realism assessments are made in comparison to empirical datasets. Previously described models (PCA- and fourier-based) of reflectance function statistics are evaluated, as are improved versions; and also a novel model, which synthesizes reflectance functions as a sum of sigmoid functions. Key model features for realism are identified. The new sigmoid-sum model is shown to be the most realistic, generating reflectance functions that are hard to distinguish from real ones, and accounting for the majority of colours found in natural images with the exception of an abundance of vegetation green and sky blue."
https://openalex.org/W2978281205,"Introduction Breast cancer is a major cause of morbidity and mortality for women in Sub-Saharan Africa and for black American women. There is evidence that the pathologic characteristics of breast cancers in both African women and black American women may differ from their counterparts of European ancestry. However, despite the great burden of disease, data on pathologic features of breast carcinoma in Sub-Saharan Africa is limited and often contradictory. This lack of information makes it difficult to prioritize resource use in efforts to improve breast cancer outcomes in the region. Methods We examined consecutive cases of breast cancer in Tanzanian women (n = 83), black American women (n = 120), and white American women (n = 120). Each case was assessed for tumor type, grade, mitotic count, ER and HER2 status, and tumor infiltrating lymphocyte involvement. Results The Tanzanian subjects were younger and had higher stage tumors than the subjects in either American group. Breast cancers in the Tanzanian and black American groups were more likely to be high grade (p = 0.008), to have a high mitotic rate (p<0.0001), and to be ER-negative (p<0.001) than the tumors in the white American group. Higher levels of tumor infiltrating lymphocyte involvement were seen among Tanzanian and black American subjects compared to white American subjects (p = 0.0001). Among all subjects, tumor infiltrating lymphocyte levels were higher in tumors with a high mitotic rate. Among Tanzanian and black American subjects, tumor infiltrating lymphocyte levels were higher in ER-negative tumors. These findings have implications for treatment priorities for breast cancer in Tanzania and other Sub-Saharan African countries."
https://openalex.org/W2985058553,"Even though the incidence of community-acquired Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) is reported to be increasing, few studies have reported on the healthcare costs of community-acquired CDI. We estimated cost of care for individuals with community-associated CDI and compared with that for matched controls without CDI in the time period of six months before to one year after CDI.All individuals in the province of Manitoba, diagnosed with CDI between July 2005 and March 2015 were matched up to 4 individuals without CDI. Health care utilization and direct costs resulting from hospitalizations, physician reimbursement claims and prescriptions were determined from the population based provincial databases. Quantile regressions were performed to determine predictors of cost of individuals with community associated CDI.Of all CDIs, 30-40% in each period of the study had community-associated CDI; of which 12% were recurrent CDIs. The incremental median and 90th percentile cost of care for individuals with community-associated CDI was $800 and $16,000 respectively in the six months after CDI diagnosis. After adjustment for age, co-morbidities, sex, socioeconomic status and magnitude of health care utilization prior to CDI, the median incremental cost for recurrent CDI was $1,812 and that for a subsequent episode of CDI was $3,139 compared to those with a single community-associated CDI episode. The median cost for a prescription of Vancomycin was $316 (IQR 209-489).Health care costs of an episode of community-associated CDI have been much more than the cost of antibiotic treatment. Our study provides population-based data for formal cost effectiveness analysis for use of newer treatments for community-associated CDI."
https://openalex.org/W2989243540,"To determine if a novel analysis method will increase the diagnostic value of the multifocal electroretinogram (mfERG) in diagnosing early-stage multiple sclerosis (MS).We studied the mfERG signals of OD (Oculus Dexter) eyes of fifteen patients diagnosed with early-stage MS (in all cases < 12 months) and without a history of optic neuritis (ON) (F:M = 11:4), and those of six controls (F:M = 3:3). We obtained values of amplitude and latency of N1 and P1 waves, and a method to assess normalized root-mean-square error (FNRMSE) between model signals and mfERG recordings was used. Responses of each eye were analysed at a global level, and by rings, quadrants and hemispheres. AUC (area under the ROC curve) is used as discriminant factor.The standard method of analysis obtains further discrimination between controls and MS in ring R3 (AUC = 0.82), analysing N1 waves amplitudes. In all of the retina analysis regions, FNRMSE value shows a greater discriminating power than the standard method. The highest AUC value (AUC = 0.91) was in the superior temporal quadrant.By analysing mfERG recordings and contrasting them with those of healthy controls it is possible to detect early-stage MS in patients without a previous history of ON."
https://openalex.org/W2984283705,"When deciding whether to invest in an improvement to animal welfare, farmers must trade-off the relative costs and benefits. Despite the existence of effective solutions to many animal welfare issues, farmers' willingness to pay for them is largely unknown. This study modelled pig farmers' decisions to improve animal welfare using a discrete choice experiment focused on alleviating aggression between growing/finishing pigs at regrouping. Eighty-two UK and Irish pig farm owners and managers were asked to choose between hypothetical aggression control strategies described in terms of four attributes; installation cost, on-going cost, impact on skin lesions from aggression and impact on growth rate. If they did not like any of the strategies they could opt to keep their current farm practice. Systematic variations in product attributes allowed farmers' preferences and willingness to pay to be estimated and latent class modelling accounted for heterogeneity in responses. The overall willingness to pay to reduce lesions was low at £0.06 per pig place (installation cost) and £0.01 per pig produced (running cost) for each 1% reduction in lesions. Results revealed three independent classes of farmers. Farmers in Class 1 were unlikely to regroup unfamiliar growing/finishing pigs, and thus were unwilling to adopt measures to reduce aggression at regrouping. Farmers in Classes 2 and 3 were willing to adopt measures providing certain pre-conditions were met. Farmers in Class 2 were motivated mainly by business goals, whilst farmers in Class 3 were motivated by both business and animal welfare goals, and were willing to pay the most to reduce aggression; £0.11 per pig place and £0.03 per pig produced for each 1% reduction in lesions. Farmers should not be considered a homogeneous group regarding the adoption of animal welfare innovations. Instead, campaigns should be targeted at subgroups according to their independent preferences and willingness to pay."

Here, we have characterized the structures of Haemophilus influenzae poly-POTRAs via X-ray crystallography, small angle X-ray scattering, and molecular dynamics simulation. Unexpectedly, crystal packing reveals a putative OMP travel pathway spiraled by the conserved α2-β2 edges in poly-POTRAs. Supportively, the structure-based mutations targeting the OMP binding sites significantly disrupt OMP biogenesis, resulting in severe cell growth defects. Another notable feature in H. influenzae POTRA structures is flexibility. As characterized by ELISA assays, poly-POTRAs could recruit OMP substrates in a step-wise manner. More importantly, the restriction of POTRA-POTRA linkage and flexibility significantly impairs the BamA function and causes cell growth defect. Altogether, these results suggest that the β-strand augmentations and intrinsic flexibility are important factors for BamA-OMP recruitment.-Ma, X., Wang, Q., Li, Y., Tan, P., Wu, H., Wang, P., Dong, X., Hong, L., Meng, G.

https://openalex.org/W2987194928,"Endonuclease V (ENDOV) is a ribonuclease with affinity for inosine which is the deamination product of adenosine. The genomes of most organisms, including human, encode ENDOV homologs, yet knowledge about in vivo functions and gene regulation is sparse. To contribute in this field, we analyzed mRNA and protein expression of human ENDOV (hENDOV). Analyses of public sequence databases revealed numerous hENDOV transcript variants suggesting extensive alternative splicing. Many of the transcripts lacked one or more exons corresponding to conserved regions of the ENDOV core domain, suggesting that these transcripts do not encode for active proteins. Three complete transcripts were found with open reading frames encoding 282, 308 and 309 amino acids, respectively. Recombinant hENDOV 308 and hENDOV 309 share the same cleavage activity as hENDOV 282 which is the variant that has been used in previous studies of hENDOV. However, hENDOV 309 binds inosine-containing RNA with stronger affinity than the other isoforms. Overexpressed GFP-fused isoforms were found in cytoplasm, nucleoli and arsenite induced stress granules in human cells as previously reported for hENDOV 282. RT-qPCR analysis of the 3’-termini showed that hENDOV 308 and hENDOV 309 transcripts are more abundant than hENDOV 282 transcripts in immortalized cell lines, but not in primary cells, suggesting that cells regulate hENDOV mRNA expression. In spite of the presence of all three full-length transcripts, mass spectrometry analyses identified peptides corresponding to the hENDOV 309 isoform only. This result suggests that further studies of human ENDOV should rather encompass the hENDOV 309 isoform."
https://openalex.org/W2983304410,"Previous studies in hares and jackrabbits have indicated that positive selection has shaped the genetic diversity of mitochondrial genes involved in oxidative phosphorylation, which may affect cellular energy production and cause regional adaptation to different environmental (climatic) pressures. In the present study, we sequenced the NADH dehydrogenase subunit 6 (MT-ND6) gene of 267 brown hares (L. europaeus) from Europe and Asia Minor and tested for positive selection and adaptations acting on amino acid sequences (protein variants). Molecular diversity indices and spatial clustering were assessed by DnaSP, Network, and Geneland, while the presence of selection signals was tested by codeml in PAML, and by using the Datamonkey Adaptive Evolution web server. The SPSS software was used to run multinomial regression models to test for possible effects of climate parameters on the currently obtained protein variants. Fifty-eight haplotypes were revealed with a haplotype diversity of 0.817, coding for 17 different protein variants. The MT-ND6 phylogeographic pattern as determined by the nucleotide sequences followed the earlier found model based on the neutrally evolving D-loop sequences, and reflected the earlier found phylogeographic Late Pleistocene scenario. Based on several selection tests, only one codon position consistently proved to be under positive selection. It did occur exclusively in the evolutionarily younger hares from Europe and it gave rise to several protein variants from the southeastern and south-central Balkans. The occurrence of several of those variants was significantly favored under certain precipitation conditions, as proved by our multinomial regression models. Possibly, the great altitudinal variation in the Balkans may have lead to bigger changes in precipitation across that region and this may have imposed an evolutionarily novel selective pressure on the protein variants and could have led to regional adaptation."
https://openalex.org/W2987376128,"With managed competition, selective contracting and the appointing of preferred providers are important instruments for health insurers to improve their bargaining position in the healthcare purchasing market. Insurers can offer enrollees extra services, such as advice about their healthcare, to attract them, ensure that they remain loyal, and to channel them to preferred providers. We investigate which advice services insurers in the Dutch system of managed competition offer enrollees, how they inform them about services, and if enrollees use and appreciate them.From November to December 2017, two researchers independently analyzed the websites of all health insurers in the Netherlands. We also conducted a questionnaire study among 1,500 members (response 44.5%, N = 668) of the Nivel Dutch Health Care Consumer Panel.All insurers offer one or more services. Most enrollees do not know if their insurer offers advice (67-87% per service). Twelve per cent (N = 76) of the enrollees indicate that they ever made use of a service, mostly regarding the choice of provider (N = 42). Respondents who used healthcare advice were satisfied with it. Of all enrollees, 41% indicate that they would probably/certainly, contact their insurer for advice and 37% would appreciate it if their insurer approached them. Among enrollees, 40% indicated the potential advice has some or a major influence on their choice of insurer.While all insurers offer at least one service, enrollees generally are unaware of them. Only a minority ever made use of such a service. However, a reasonable proportion do appreciate their insurers' advice services and indicate that they would like to have contact with their insurer if they need care. Insurers do not appear to make the best use of the potential for giving healthcare advice and need to think about ways to increase coverage of those services."
https://openalex.org/W2988503866,"Non-coding RNAs have raised a lot of interest because of their capabilities to perform enzymatic reactions and regulate gene expression in various ways. Human Accelerated Region 1 (HAR1) has been identified during the search for highly conserved regions in mammalian genomes, over one hundred base pairs long, and with high rates of substitution in the human genome. Its potential for coding for a protein is very minimal. However, the HAR1 transcript has been computationally predicted to have a stable secondary structure. Previous structure-probing experiments have suggested that the majority of differences between human and chimp constructs are in helices, designated C and D. For this reason, a 47nt construct consisting of the C and D helices along with two additional C-G pairs was synthesized, purified, and crystallized, and its x-ray structure is reported in this study. The final structure is an artificial dimer, with a bulge that forms different conformations on each monomer. This bulge has been observed in predicted secondary structures, footprinting assays, enzymatic degradation assays, NMR studies, in silico studies, and in this crystalized dimer structure. It is proposed that the HAR1 transcript is a non-coding RNA that interacts with an unknown binding partner responsible for brain development through this inherent structural motif of bulged adenosines."
https://openalex.org/W2984520070,"Deperetellidae is a clade of peculiar, Asian endemic tapiroids from the early and middle Eocene. The previously published material mainly comprises maxillae, mandibles, and some postcranial elements. However, the absence of cranial materials and primitive representatives of the deperetellids obscures their phylogenetic relationships within Tapiroidea. Furthermore, derived deperetellids have completely molarized premolars, but the pattern of their evolution remains unclear. Here, we report a nearly complete skull and some carpals of a new basal deperetellid tapiroid, Irenolophus qii gen. et sp. nov., from the late early Eocene of the Erlian Basin, Inner Mongolia, China. We suggest that deperetellids (along with Tapiridae) probably also arose from some basal ‘helaletids’, based on the reduced, flat, lingually depressed metacones on the upper molars, the trend towards the bilophodonty on the lower molars, and a shallow narial notch with the premaxilla in contact with the nasal. The molarization of the premolars in Deperetellidae from Irenolophus through Teleolophus to Deperetella was initiated and gradually enhanced by the separation between the paraconule and the protocone. That pattern differs from the protocone-hypocone separation in helaletids, tapirids, and most rhinoceroses, and the metaconule-derived pseudohypocone in amynodontids. However, the specific relationship of deperetellids within Tapiroidea and the roles of different patterns of premolar molarization in perissodactyl evolution need further and comprehensive study."
https://openalex.org/W2985670000,"Gene-environment interactions contribute to the risk for Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). Among environmental factors, prenatal exposure to stress may increase the risk for ASD. To examine if there is an interaction between exposure to maternal stress and reduced dosage or loss of Shank3, wild-type (WT), heterozygous (HET) and homozygous (HOM) female mice carrying a deletion of exons four through nine of Shank3 (Shank3ex4-9) were exposed to chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS) from prior to conception throughout gestation. This study examined maternal care of these dams and the white matter microstructure in the brains of their adult male offspring. Overall, our findings suggest that maternal exposure to CUMS increased pup-directed care for dams of all three genotypes. Compared to WT and HET dams, HOM dams also exhibited increased maternal care behaviors with increased time spent in the nest and reduced cage exploration, regardless of exposure to CUMS. Diffusion tensor imaging showed higher mean fractional anisotropy in the hippocampal stratum radiatum of WT and HOM male offspring from dams exposed to CUMS and HOM offspring from unexposed dams, compared to WT male offspring from unexposed dams. These data support that CUMS in Shank3-mutant dams results in subtle maternal care alterations and long-lasting changes in the white matter of the hippocampus of their offspring."
