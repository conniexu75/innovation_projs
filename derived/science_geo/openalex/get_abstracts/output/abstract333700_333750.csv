https://openalex.org/W2067442875,"Recent advances in the intercalation of metal complex cations in smectite clay minerals are leading to the development of new classes of selective heterogeneous catalysts. The selectivity of both metal-catalyzed and proton-catalyzed chemical conversions in clay intercalates can often be regulated by controlling surface chemical equilibria, interlamellar swelling, or reactant pair proximity in the interlayer regions. Also, the intercalation of polynuclear hydroxy metal cations and metal cluster cations in smectites affords new pillared clay catalysts with pore sizes that can be made larger than those of conventional zeolite catalysts."
https://openalex.org/W2030924232,Female Physalaemus pustulosus choose their mates and are more likely to choose larger males. There is a significant negative correlation between the size of the male and the fundamental frequency of one of the components of its advertisement call. Playback experiments demonstrate that females are capable of choosing larger males by distinguishing among differences in spectral components of the advertisement call.
https://openalex.org/W1963632378,"Pakicetus inachus from the early Eocene of Pakistan is the oldest and most primitive cetacean known. The dentition of Pakicetus resembles that of carnivorous mesonychid land mammals as well as middle Eocene cetaceans. The otic region of the cranium lacks characteristic specializations of whales necessary for efficient directional hearing under water. Pakicetus occurs with a land-mammal fauna in fluvial sediments bordering epicontinental Eocene remnants of the eastern Tethys seaway. Discovery of Pakicetus strengthens earlier inferences that whales originated from terrestrial carnivorous mammals and suggests that whales made a gradual transition from land to sea in the early Eocene, spending progressively more time feeding on planktivorous fishes in shallow, highly productive seas and embayments associated with tectonic closure of eastern Tethys."
https://openalex.org/W2001085174,"Female moorhens in flocks competed with each other to obtain mates. The heaviest females won most of the agonistic encounters, and these females paired with males that had large fat reserves. Fat males tended to be small, possibly because of energetic constraints on birds of large body size. Females paired with fat males initiated more nesting attempts in a season."
https://openalex.org/W2083796591,"The effects of atmospheric carbon dioxide on corn, soybeans, loblolly pine, and sweetgum were studied in the field during a growing season. The plants were exposed to a range of concentrations of carbon dioxide day and night in open-topped, flow-through chambers. At a mean daytime carbon dioxide concentration of 910 parts per million, increases in total biomass ranged from 157 to 186 percent of the control values. Seed yield and wood volume increased and there were changes in plant anatomy and form. Net photosynthesis increased with increasing carbon dioxide concentration in soybeans and sweetgum, but was unaffected in corn. Water use efficiency also increased in corn, soybeans, and sweetgum."
https://openalex.org/W2088940257,"The Murchison and Allende chondrites contain up to 5 parts per million carbon that is enriched in carbon-13 by up to + 1100 per mil (the ratio of carbon-12 to carbon-13 is approximately 42, compared to 88 to 93 for terrestrial carbon). This ""heavy"" carbon is associated with neon-22 and with anomalous krypton and xenon showing the signature of the s-process (neutron capture on a slow time scale). It apparently represents interstellar grains ejected from late-type stars. A second anomalous xenon component (""CCFXe"") is associated with a distinctive, light carbon (depleted in carbon-13 by 38 per mil), which, however, falls within the terrestrial range and hence may be of either local or exotic origin."
https://openalex.org/W2075897948,"Earlier estimates of the chlorine emission from volcanoes, based upon evaluations of the preeruption magmatic chlorine content, are too low for some explosive volcanoes by a factor of 20 to 40 or more. Degassing of ash erupted during 1976 by Augustine Volcano in Alaska released 525 x 10(6) kilograms of chlorine (+/- 40 percent), of which 82 x 10(6) to 175 x 10(6) kilograms may have been ejected into the stratosphere as hydrogen chloride. This stratospheric contribution is equivalent to 17 to 36 percent of the 1975 world industrial production of chlorine in fluorocarbons."
https://openalex.org/W1977174002,A model for using mate preference data to deduce the direction of evolution between populations related by founder events or population bottlenecks is examined. Data from a wide range of organisms satisfying the necessary constraints of population structure are compatible with the model developed by K. Y. Kaneshiro from studies of Hawaiian Drosophila.
https://openalex.org/W2031844748,"In leaves of plants with C4 photosynthesis, sulfur assimilation is initiated in bundle sheath cells whereas carbon and nitrogen assimilation are initiated in mesophyll cells. The activation of sulfate by adenosine triphosphate sulfurylase in leaves of C4 plants occurs in chloroplasts of bundle sheath cells and is effected by two isozymes of approximately equal activities that accounted for 95 to 100 percent of the total leaf activity."
https://openalex.org/W2024076979,"Respiration in the heat-generating, sterile florets of Philodendron selloum was examined by electron microscopy and carbon isotopic analysis of respired carbon dioxide. After the spathe unfolded, the florets switched from carbohydrate oxidation to lipid oxidation, which persisted during heating and for at least 2 days thereafter. The scarcity of glyoxysome-like organelles and the low catalase activity in this tissue indicate that the lipid was respired directly and not after conversion to carbohydrate by the glyoxylate shunt. Thus, lipid metabolism in this heat-generating plant tissue appears to mimic aspects of the biochemistry and physiology of heat production in some animal tissues."

https://openalex.org/W1989259696,"Helium is removed at an average rate of 10(6) atoms per square centimeter per second from Venus's atmosphere by the solar wind following ionization above the plasmapause. The surface source of helium-4 on Venus is similar to that on Earth, suggesting comparable abundances of crustal uranium and thorium."
https://openalex.org/W2005790912,"The results of selfing and intercrossing two strains of the flax rust fungus Melampsora lini indicate that this species does not possess a simple(+) and(-) mating system. Instead, the data are consistent with the assumption that the genetic control of mating type in Melampsora lini is similar to that in the mushroom Schizophyllum commune, in which mating type is determined by two factors, each of which is controlled by two linked loci."

https://openalex.org/W1993993371,The mass spectrometric properties of a series of model ion pairs were examined. In the cases studied it was possible to vaporize the ion pair constituents and to produce spectra corresponding to those of the unpaired materials. These findings offer a convenient means for derivatizing certain ionic compounds and demonstrate the feasibility of analyzing ionic species by on-line liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry.

https://openalex.org/W4244538832,"In the report ""Cloud droplet deposition in subalpine balsam fir forests: Hydrological and chemical inputs"" by G. M. Lovett et al. (24 Dec., p. 1303), two errors appeared in Table 2 on page 1304. The cloud deposition of SO(4)(2-), incorrectly reported as 275.8 kg ha(-1) year(-1), should have been 137.9 kg ha(-1) year(-1). The percentage of the sum contributed by clouds, reported as 81 for SO(4)(2-), should have been 68."
