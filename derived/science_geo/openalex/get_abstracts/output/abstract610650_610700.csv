https://openalex.org/W2800654890,"High-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSC) exhibits extensive malignant clonal diversity with widespread but non-random patterns of disease dissemination. We investigated whether local immune microenvironment factors shape tumor progression properties at the interface of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) and cancer cells. Through multi-region study of 212 samples from 38 patients with whole-genome sequencing, immunohistochemistry, histologic image analysis, gene expression profiling, and T and B cell receptor sequencing, we identified three immunologic subtypes across samples and extensive within-patient diversity. Epithelial CD8+ TILs negatively associated with malignant diversity, reflecting immunological pruning of tumor clones inferred by neoantigen depletion, HLA I loss of heterozygosity, and spatial tracking between T cell and tumor clones. In addition, combinatorial prognostic effects of mutational processes and immune properties were observed, illuminating how specific genomic aberration types associate with immune response and impact survival. We conclude that within-patient spatial immune microenvironment variation shapes intraperitoneal malignant spread, provoking new evolutionary perspectives on HGSC clonal dispersion."

Here, we find that a bacterial pathogen, Streptococcus pyogenes, hijacks pain and neuronal regulation of the immune response to promote bacterial survival. Necrotizing fasciitis is a life-threatening soft tissue infection in which ""pain is out of proportion"" to early physical manifestations. We find that S. pyogenes, the leading cause of necrotizing fasciitis, secretes streptolysin S (SLS) to directly activate nociceptor neurons and produce pain during infection. Nociceptors, in turn, release the neuropeptide calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) into infected tissues, which inhibits the recruitment of neutrophils and opsonophagocytic killing of S. pyogenes. Botulinum neurotoxin A and CGRP antagonism block neuron-mediated suppression of host defense, thereby preventing and treating S. pyogenes necrotizing infection. We conclude that targeting the peripheral nervous system and blocking neuro-immune communication is a promising strategy to treat highly invasive bacterial infections. VIDEO ABSTRACT."

To identify novel treatment options for such patients, we searched for acquired vulnerabilities of MAPK inhibitor-resistant melanomas. We find that resistance to BRAF+MEK inhibitors is associated with increased levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Subsequent treatment with the histone deacetylase inhibitor vorinostat suppresses SLC7A11, leading to a lethal increase in the already-elevated levels of ROS in drug-resistant cells. This causes selective apoptotic death of only the drug-resistant tumor cells. Consistently, treatment of BRAF inhibitor-resistant melanoma with vorinostat in mice results in dramatic tumor regression.

Approximately half of melanoma skin cancers carry activating mutations in the BRAF oncogene, leading to activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway. Inhibition of the BRAF oncoprotein by targeted drugs provides substantial benefit to patients, albeit most patients ultimately relapse with resistant disease (Sosman et al., 2012Sosman J.A. Kim K.B. Schuchter L. Gonzalez R. Pavlick A.C. Weber J.S. McArthur G.A. Hutson T.E. Moschos S.J. Flaherty K.T. et al.Survival in BRAF V600-mutant advanced melanoma treated with vemurafenib.N. Engl. J. Med. 2012; 366: 707-714Crossref PubMed Scopus (1769) Google Scholar). Dual inhibition of both BRAF and the downstream MEK kinases leads to more sustained clinical benefit, but resistance is still mostly inevitable (Robert et al., 2015Robert C. Karaszewska B. Schachter J. Rutkowski P. Mackiewicz A. Stroiakovski D. Lichinitser M. Dummer R. Grange F. Mortier L. et al.Improved overall survival in melanoma with combined dabrafenib and trametinib.N. Engl. J. Med. 2015; 372: 30-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (1824) Google Scholar). Resistance to MAPK pathway inhibitors in melanoma is frequently caused by reactivation of signaling through this pathway in the presence of drug (Van Allen et al., 2014Van Allen E.M. Wagle N. Sucker A. Treacy D.J. Johannessen C.M. Goetz E.M. Place C.S. Taylor-Weiner A. Whittaker S.

Farlow D.N. et al.MAP kinase pathway alterations in BRAF-mutant melanoma patients with acquired resistance to combined RAF/MEK inhibition.Cancer Discov. 2014; 4: 61-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar). Multiple mechanisms of MAPK reactivation have been described, including upregulation of receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs), mutations in KRAS and NRAS, splice site mutations in BRAF, amplification of BRAF, and mutation of MEK kinases (reviewed by Manzano et al., 2016Manzano J.L. Layos L. Bugés C. de Los Llanos Gil M. Vila L. Martínez-Balibrea E. Martínez-Cardús A. Resistant mechanisms to BRAF inhibitors in melanoma.Ann. Transl. Med. 2016; 4: 237Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Drug withdrawal in such drug-resistant patients often does not lead to an immediate disease flare up, but rather to a transient pause in tumor growth, known as the “drug holiday effect” (Seghers et al., 2012Seghers A.C. Wilgenhof S. Lebbé C. Neyns B. Successful rechallenge in two patients with BRAF-V600-mutant melanoma who experienced previous progression during treatment with a selective BRAF inhibitor.Melanoma Res. 2012; 22: 466-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). This effect can be explained, at least in part, by hyper-activation of the MAPK pathway signaling following drug withdrawal, leading to a cellular state that has hallmarks of oncogene-induced senescence (Sun et al., 2014Sun C. Wang L. Huang S. Heynen G.J.J.E. Prahallad A. Robert C. Haanen J. Blank C. Wesseling J. Willems S.M. et al.Reversible and adaptive resistance to BRAF(V600E) inhibition in melanoma.Nature. 2014; 508: 118-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (570) Google Scholar). Downregulation of this hyper-active MAPK signaling marks the end of the drug holiday, resulting in reinitiation of tumor growth and regained drug sensitivity upon rechallenge with BRAF inhibitor (Seghers et al., 2012Seghers A.C. Wilgenhof S. Lebbé C. Neyns B. Successful rechallenge in two patients with BRAF-V600-mutant melanoma who experienced previous progression during treatment with a selective BRAF inhibitor.Melanoma Res. 2012; 22: 466-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). The transient proliferation arrest of BRAF inhibitor-resistant melanomas following drug withdrawal points to an acquired vulnerability of drug-resistant cells that was not present in the parental drug-sensitive cells (Sun et al., 2014Sun C. Wang L. Huang S. Heynen G.J.J.E. Prahallad A. Robert C. Haanen J. Blank C. Wesseling J. Willems S.M. et al.Reversible and adaptive resistance to BRAF(V600E) inhibition in melanoma.Nature. 2014; 508: 118-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (570) Google Scholar). That drug resistance of cancer cells comes at a fitness cost that in turn can cause sensitivity to other drugs was identified over 50 years ago and is referred to as “collateral sensitivity” (Hutchison, 1963Hutchison D.J. Cross resistance and collateral sensitivity studies in cancer chemotherapy.in: Haddow A. Weinhouse S. Advances in Cancer Research. Academic Press, 1963: 235-350Crossref Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Previous studies have pointed to alterations in mitochondrial oxidative metabolism when signaling through the MAPK pathway is modulated (Baenke et al., 2016Baenke F. Chaneton B. Smith M.

Here, we report a collateral sensitivity of BRAF inhibitor-resistant melanoma that takes advantage of increased levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in drug-resistant cells. To explore new therapeutic strategies for melanomas having acquired resistance to inhibitors of the MAPK pathway, we generated drug-resistant derivatives of BRAF mutant A375 human melanoma cells by long-term culture in the presence of the BRAF inhibitor vemurafenib (A375R, resistant cells) or a combination of the BRAF inhibitor dabrafenib and the MEK inhibitor trametinib (A375DR, double-resistant cells). In a short-term proliferation assay, A375R and A375DR cells proliferated in the presence of vemurafenib and the combination of dabrafenib plus trametinib, respectively, whereas parental A375 cells were sensitive to MAPK inhibition (Figure 1A). In the absence of MAPK inhibitors (MAPKi), A375R and A375DR cells displayed slight proliferation impairment, modeling the drug holiday effect seen in the clinic (Seghers et al., 2012Seghers A.C. Wilgenhof S. Lebbé C. Neyns B. Successful rechallenge in two patients with BRAF-V600-mutant melanoma who experienced previous progression during treatment with a selective BRAF inhibitor.Melanoma Res. 2012; 22: 466-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Quantification of cell viability at the end of the proliferation assay confirmed the sustained viability of the MAPKi-resistant A375R and A375DR derivatives in the presence of the drugs (Figure 1B). Further characterization of these derivatives revealed that A375R cells have gained platelet-derived growth factor receptor B (PDGFRB) expression (Figure 1C), while A375DR cells acquired a secondary NRASQ61H mutation (Figure 1D). Similar results were obtained in Mel888 cells, another BRAFV600E mutated human melanoma model. After a similar long-term culture protocol in MAPKi, we isolated a variant resistant to vemurafenib (Mel888R) (Figures S1A and S1C) and a line resistant to the combination of dabrafenib plus trametinib (Mel888DR) (Figures S1B and S1C). Mel888R cells express a splice variant of BRAF (Figure S1D), whereas Mel888DR harbor a secondary KRASG12C mutation (Figure S1E). These four resistance mutations commonly found in melanoma patients that develop resistance to drugs that target BRAF and/or MEK kinases converge on the hyper-activation of the MAPK pathway. These data also underscore that, although generated in vitro, our drug-resistant melanoma cell line derivatives faithfully recapitulate clinical drug resistance.Figure S1ROS Levels and ROS Sensitivity of Additional Melanoma Cells, Related to Figure 1Show full caption(A) Long-term colony formation assay of parental (Mel888) and BRAFi-resistant (Mel888R) melanoma cells were seeded 50,000 cells per well in a 6-well plate and cultured in the presence or absence of 2 μM vemurafenib for 10 days.(B) Long-term colony formation assay of parental (Mel888) and BRAFi/MEKi-double drug resistant (Mel888DR) melanoma cells were seeded 50,000 cells per well in a 6-well plate and cultured in the presence or absence of 0.5 μM dabrafenib and 10 nM trametinib.(C) Cell viability assay of parental and drug-resistant cells were seeded 3,000 cells per well in a 96-well plate and cultured in the presence or absence of MAPK inhibitors for 96 hr, and then measured with CellTiter-Blue.(D) Protein western blot analysis for BRAF indicating that Mel888R cells harbor a 61 kDa BRAF variant.(E) Sanger sequencing of the KRAS gene in Mel888DR cells showing a KRASG12C mutation.(F) ROS levels of Mel888R, Mel888DR and their parental cells were measured after 72 hr culturing without drugs.

One of the features of increased RAS signaling is the abundant production of ROS, which serve as signaling molecules in multiple cellular pathways (Lee et al., 1999Lee A.C. Fenster B.E. Ito H. Takeda K. Bae N.S. Hirai T. Yu Z.X. Ferrans V.J. Howard B.H. Finkel T. Ras proteins induce senescence by altering the intracellular levels of reactive oxygen species.J. Biol.

Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2001; 98: 10833-10838Crossref PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar). To test whether this is also the case in melanoma, we measured ROS levels using fluorescent flow cytometry. Indeed, basal levels of ROS were 2-fold higher in single drug-resistant cells (A375R and Mel888R) and increased even further in double drug-resistant cells (A375DR and Mel888DR) (Figures 1E and S1F). We hypothesized that this increase in ROS levels may represent an acquired vulnerability in the sense that a further increase in ROS levels could become detrimental to the drug-resistant cells. To test this, we exposed parental and drug-resistant melanoma cells to the ROS inducer paraquat. Indeed, paraquat treatment inhibited the proliferation of single-resistant A375R cells and double-resistant A375DR cells in a colony formation assay, while it induced only slight proliferation impairment in the parental cells (Figures 1F, 1G, S1G, and S1H). The sensitivity to paraquat in resistant melanoma cells was proportional to the higher basal ROS levels (Figures 1E and S1F) and correlated with an increase of DNA damage and apoptosis, as evidenced by the presence of γ-H2AX and cleaved PARP, respectively (Figures 1I and S1J). The notion that increased sensitivity of MAPKi-resistant cells to paraquat is mediated by increased ROS levels is supported by the observation that treatment with the ROS scavenger N-acetyl-cysteine (NAC) reduced ROS levels negated the sensitivity of BRAFi-resistant cells to paraquat (Figures 1H and S1I) and reduced DNA damage and apoptosis (Figures 1I, 1J, S1J, and S1K). These findings indicate that regardless of the type of mutation responsible for acquired MAPKi-resistance in melanomas, ROS induction is a common vulnerability that can be targeted with ROS inducers. To take this concept closer to a potential clinical use, we searched for approved drugs that also induce ROS. We selected histone deacetylase inhibitor (HDACi) vorinostat, because vorinostat has a safe pharmacological profile in the clinic and HDACi are known to induce ROS (Petruccelli et al., 2011Petruccelli L.A.

To test whether vorinostat also induces ROS in melanoma, we treated our two cell models with vorinostat for 72 hr and measured intracellular ROS. Indeed, vorinostat induced ROS levels in parental and resistant cells, which could be prevented by co-treatment with NAC (Figures 2A and S2A). In long-term proliferation assays, vorinostat treatment inhibited the growth of drug-resistant cells, but the combination of vorinostat and NAC rescued this effect in both melanoma models (Figures 2B and S2B). Again, the vorinostat effect was far more pronounced in MAPKi-resistant melanoma cells, as it only caused mild proliferation impairment in parental cells, also in a short-term Incucyte assay (Figures 2C and S2C). The differential effect of vorinostat is most likely explained by the much higher ROS levels induced in MAPKi-resistant melanoma cells as compared to the ROS levels induced by vorinostat in parental cells (Figures 2A and S2A). Similar to paraquat treatment, vorinostat induced DNA damage and apoptosis in BRAFi-resistant, but not in parental A375 cells, which was rescued by NAC treatment (Figure 2D). In Mel888 cells, vorinostat treatment also induced apoptosis in MAPKi-resistant cells (Mel888R and Mel888DR) but not in the parental line (Figure S2D). The same results were essentially obtained with a second ROS scavenger glutathione ethyl ester (GEE) as GEE also reduced ROS levels induced by vorinostat and rescued the proliferation defect induced by vorinostat in MAPK inhibitor-resistant cells (Figures 2E, 2F, S2E, and S2F). These observations suggest that a certain ROS level is required to inflict sufficient DNA damage and to activate cell death pathways, which is only achieved by vorinostat in drug-resistant, but not in parental, melanoma cells.Figure S2HDACi Is Detrimental to MAPKi-Resistant BRAF and NRAS Mutant Melanoma Cells, Related to Figure 2Show full caption(A) Parental and MAPKi-resistant Mel888 cells were treated with 2 μM vorinostat and/or 2.5 mM NAC for 72 hr.

(H) Long-term colony formation assays of parental and MEKi-resistant SK-MEL-147 cells treated with vorinostat and/or NAC. Cells were seeded 50,000 cells per well in 6-well plates and treated with 1 μM or 1.5 μM vorinostat, 2.5 mM NAC and/or 100 nM trametinib for 8 days. Afterward, the cells were fixed, stained, and photographed. Error bars in this figure represent as mean ± standard deviations from biological triplicates (∗p ≤ 0.05, ∗∗p ≤ 0.01, ∗∗∗p ≤ 0.001, Student’s t test). We also tested the vorinostat sensitivity in NRAS mutant melanoma cells, since this gene is the second most commonly mutated in melanoma patients. We generated NRAS mutant SK-MEL-147 melanoma cells resistant to MEK inhibitor by long-term culture in trametinib-containing medium. Vorinostat treatment of parental SK-MEL-147 cells and resistant derivatives (SK-MEL-147R) induced an increase in intracellular ROS levels that could be abrogated with co-treatment with NAC (Figure S2G). Accordingly, in a colony formation assay SK-MEL-147R cells showed increased sensitivity to vorinostat as compared to the parental line. This sensitivity was reversed by the concomitant treatment with NAC (Figure S2H). It has been shown in short-term assays that combined HDAC and MAPK inhibition can prevent some forms of MAPK inhibitor resistance in melanoma (Johannessen et al., 2013Johannessen C.M. Johnson L.A. Piccioni F. Townes A. Frederick D.T. Donahue M.K. Narayan R. Flaherty K.T. Wargo J.A. Root D.E. Garraway L.A. A melanocyte lineage program confers resistance to MAP kinase pathway inhibition.Nature. 2013; 504: 138-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar). It also has been shown, however, that increased ROS levels lead to activation of the MAPK pathway (Son et al., 2011Son Y. Cheong Y.K. Kim N.H. Chung H.T. Kang D.G. Pae H.O. Mitogen-activated protein kinases and reactive oxygen species: how can ROS activate MAPK pathways?.J. Signal Transduct. 2011; 2011: 792639Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This would suggest that vorinostat, by virtue of its increase in ROS levels, could activate MAPK signaling and thereby counteract the effects of MAPK inhibitors. Indeed, also in melanoma, vorinostat activated MAPK signaling in A375, A375R, and A375DR cells, as evidenced by an increase in phosphorylated MEK (pMEK) and p-P90RSK (Figures 3A and 3B ). While MAPK inhibitors were able to reduce levels of pMEK and p-P90RSK in all three cells, combined treatment with MAPKi and vorinostat resulted in significant residual MAPK signaling (Figures 3A and 3B). Consistent with this, treatment of A375 or Mel888 cells with a combination of HDACi and MAPKi resulte"

However, preventing β cell exhaustion under diabetic conditions is a major therapeutic challenge. Here, we identify the vitamin D receptor (VDR) as a key modulator of inflammation and β cell survival. Alternative recognition of an acetylated lysine in VDR by bromodomain proteins BRD7 and BRD9 directs association to PBAF and BAF chromatin remodeling complexes, respectively. Mechanistically, ligand promotes VDR association with PBAF to effect genome-wide changes in chromatin accessibility and enhancer landscape, resulting in an anti-inflammatory response. Importantly, pharmacological inhibition of BRD9 promotes PBAF-VDR association to restore β cell function and ameliorate hyperglycemia in murine T2D models. These studies reveal an unrecognized VDR-dependent transcriptional program underpinning β cell survival and identifies the VDR:PBAF/BAF association as a potential therapeutic target for T2D."
https://openalex.org/W2803644409,"The use of dsRNA to control insect pests via the RNA interference (RNAi) pathway is being explored by researchers globally. However, with every new class of insect control compounds, the evolution of insect resistance needs to be considered, and understanding resistance mechanisms is essential in designing durable technologies and effective resistance management strategies. To gain insight into insect resistance to dsRNA, a field screen with subsequent laboratory selection was used to establish a population of DvSnf7 dsRNA-resistant western corn rootworm, Diabrotica virgifera virgifera, a major maize insect pest. WCR resistant to ingested DvSnf7 dsRNA had impaired luminal uptake and resistance was not DvSnf7 dsRNA-specific, as indicated by cross resistance to all other dsRNAs tested. No resistance to the Bacillus thuringiensis Cry3Bb1 protein was observed. DvSnf7 dsRNA resistance was inherited recessively, located on a single locus, and autosomal. Together these findings will provide insights for dsRNA deployment for insect pest control."

As predicted by the notion that sister chromatid cohesion is mediated by entrapment of sister DNAs inside cohesin rings, there is perfect correlation between co-entrapment of circular minichromosomes and sister chromatid cohesion. In most cells where cohesin loads without conferring cohesion, it does so by entrapment of individual DNAs. However, cohesin with a hinge domain whose positively charged lumen is neutralized loads and moves along chromatin despite failing to entrap DNAs. Thus, cohesin engages chromatin in non-topological, as well as topological, manners. Since hinge mutations, but not Smc-kleisin fusions, abolish entrapment, DNAs may enter cohesin rings through hinge opening. Mutation of three highly conserved lysine residues inside the Smc1 moiety of Smc1/3 hinges abolishes all loading without affecting cohesin’s recruitment to CEN loading sites or its ability to hydrolyze ATP. We suggest that loading and translocation are mediated by conformational changes in cohesin’s hinge driven by cycles of ATP hydrolysis.

Smc/kleisin complexes facilitate chromosome segregation in bacteria as well as eukaryotes (Schleiffer et al., 2003Schleiffer A. Kaitna S. Maurer-Stroh S. Glotzer M. Nasmyth K. Eisenhaber F. Kleisins: A superfamily of bacterial and eukaryotic SMC protein partners.Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 571-575Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). The latter have three types: condensin, cohesin, and the Smc5/6 complex (Haering and Gruber, 2016Haering C.H. Gruber S. SnapShot: SMC Protein Complexes Part I.Cell. 2016; 164: 326Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Though initially identified as being essential for holding the sister chromatids together, cohesin shares with condensin an ability to organize DNA into chromatids. While condensin does this during mitosis (Hirano et al., 1997Hirano T. Kobayashi R. Hirano M.

Bhaskara V. et al.Wapl is an essential regulator of chromatin structure and chromosome segregation.Nature. 2013; 501: 564-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). It has been suggested that both types of complexes capture small loops of DNA and then extrude them in a processive manner (Nasmyth, 2001Nasmyth K. Disseminating the genome: Joining, resolving, and separating sister chromatids during mitosis and meiosis.Annu. Rev. Genet. 2001; 35: 673-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (589) Google Scholar), a concept that has recently been embellished to explain the pattern of intra-chromosomal interactions during interphase as well as the process by which interactions between enhancers and distant promoters are regulated by the insulation factor CTCF (Fudenberg et al., 2016Fudenberg G. Imakaev M. Lu C. Goloborodko A. Abdennur N. Mirny L.A.

USA. 2015; 112: E6456-E6465Crossref PubMed Scopus (935) Google Scholar). At cohesin’s core is a heterotrimeric ring containing a pair of SMC proteins, Smc1 and Smc3, and an α-kleisin subunit Scc1. Smc1 and Smc3 are rod-shaped proteins containing 50-nm-long intra-molecular anti-parallel coiled coils with a hinge/dimerization domain at one end and an ABC-like ATPase head domain composed of the protein’s N- and C-terminal sequences at the other. They bind each other via their hinges to form V-shaped heterodimers whose apical ATPases are interconnected by a single Scc1 polypeptide (Gruber et al., 2003Gruber S. Haering C.H. Nasmyth K. Chromosomal cohesin forms a ring.Cell. 2003; 112: 765-777Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar). Scc1’s N-terminal domain (NTD) forms a four helical bundle with the coiled coil emerging from Smc3’s ATPase (Gligoris et al., 2014Gligoris T.G. Scheinost J.C. Bürmann F. Petela N. Chan K.L. Uluocak P. Beckouët F. Gruber S. Nasmyth K. Löwe J. Closing the cohesin ring: Structure and function of its Smc3-kleisin interface.Science. 2014; 346: 963-967Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar), while its winged helical C-terminal domain (CTD) binds to the base of Smc1’s ATPase (Haering et al., 2004Haering C.H. Schoffnegger D. Nishino T. Helmhart W. Nasmyth K. Löwe J. Structure and stability of cohesin’s Smc1-kleisin interaction.Mol. Cell. 2004; 15: 951-964Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). Bacterial Smc/kleisin complexes form similar structures, suggesting that asymmetric ring formation is a universal feature (Bürmann et al., 2013Bürmann F. Shin H.C. Basquin J. Soh Y.M. Giménez-Oya V. Kim Y.G. Oh B.H. Gruber S. An asymmetric SMC-kleisin bridge in prokaryotic condensin.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2013; 20: 371-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). This structure raises the possibility that Smc/kleisin complexes associate with chromosomal DNAs by entrapping them inside their rings (Haering et al., 2008Haering C.H. Farcas A.M. Arumugam P. Metson J. Nasmyth K. The cohesin ring concatenates sister DNA molecules.Nature. 2008; 454: 297-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar). Several types of such topological engagement have been envisaged for cohesin. Entrapment either of individual DNAs or loops of DNA might constitute the mechanism by which it associates with chromatin per se. On the other hand, sister chromatid cohesion could be conferred either by co-entrapment of sister DNAs inside the same ring (ring model) or through an association between two rings, each topologically engaged with DNA (handcuff model). Hitherto only entrapment of individual DNAs or of a pair of sister DNAs inside what appears to be a single cohesin ring has proven amenable to detection (Gligoris et al., 2014Gligoris T.G. Scheinost J.C. Bürmann F. Petela N. Chan K.L. Uluocak P. Beckouët F. Gruber S. Nasmyth K. Löwe J.

Arumugam P. Metson J. Nasmyth K. The cohesin ring concatenates sister DNA molecules.Nature. 2008; 454: 297-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar). If cohesin associates with chromatin by entrapping DNA, then loading and release must involve passage of DNA through entry and exit gates, respectively. More is known about the mechanism of release. Cohesin dissociates from chromosomes after cleavage of Scc1 by separase at the onset of anaphase (Uhlmann et al., 1999Uhlmann F. Lottspeich F. Nasmyth K. Sister-chromatid separation at anaphase onset is promoted by cleavage of the cohesin subunit Scc1.Nature. 1999; 400: 37-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (753) Google Scholar) but at other stages of the cycle in a manner involving dissociation of the Smc3/Scc1 interface (Beckouët et al., 2016Beckouët F. Srinivasan M. Roig M.B. Chan K.L. Scheinost J.C. Batty P. Hu B. Petela N. Gligoris T.

Cell. 2016; 61: 563-574Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). This separase-independent releasing activity depends on a protein called Wapl (Kueng et al., 2006Kueng S. Hegemann B. Peters B.H. Lipp J.J. Schleiffer A. Mechtler K. Peters J.M. Wapl controls the dynamic association of cohesin with chromatin.Cell. 2006; 127: 955-967Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar) that binds to a pair of hook-shaped proteins, associated with Scc1, namely, Scc3 and Pds5. Release also depends on a pair of highly conserved lysine residues (K112 and K113) on Smc3’s ATPase, whose modification by the acetyl transferase Eco1 during S phase abolishes release (Beckouët et al., 2016Beckouët F. Srinivasan M. Roig M.B. Chan K.L. Scheinost J.C. Batty P. Hu B. Petela N. Gligoris T.

A molecular determinant for the establishment of sister chromatid cohesion.Science. 2008; 321: 566-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar), thereby helping to maintain cohesion until the onset of anaphase. The mechanism by which cohesin loads onto chromosomes is less well understood. It requires engagement of Smc1 and Smc3 ATPase heads as well as subsequent ATP hydrolysis (Arumugam et al., 2003Arumugam P. Gruber S. Tanaka K. Haering C.H. Mechtler K. Nasmyth K. ATP hydrolysis is required for cohesin’s association with chromosomes.Curr. Biol. 2003; 13: 1941-1953Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). Neither Pds5 nor Wapl are necessary (Petela et al., 2017Petela N. Gligoris T. Metson J. Lee B. Voulgaris M. Hu B. Kikuchi S. Chapard C. Chen W. Rajendra E. et al.Multiple interactions between Scc1 and Scc2 activate cohesin’s DNA dependent ATPase and replace Pds5 during loading.bioRxiv. 2017; https://doi.org/10.1101/205914Crossref Google Scholar) but instead a separate complex containing Scc4 bound to the NTD of another Hawk protein called Scc2 is essential (Ciosk et al., 2000Ciosk R. Shirayama M. Shevchenko A. Tanaka T. Toth A. Shevchenko A. Nasmyth K. Cohesin’s binding to chromosomes depends on a separate complex consisting of Scc2 and Scc4 proteins.Mol.

Biological chromodynamics: A general method for measuring protein occupancy across the genome by calibrating ChIP-seq.Nucleic Acids Res. 2015; 43: e132PubMed Google Scholar). Unlike release, which is blocked by fusion of Smc3’s ATPase to Scc1’s NTD, loading is not abolished by fusion of Smc3 or Smc1 ATPases to Scc1’s NTD or CTD, respectively, a finding that has led to the suggestion that DNAs enter via cohesin’s Smc1/Smc3 hinge domain (Gruber et al., 2006Gruber S. Arumugam P. Katou Y. Kuglitsch D. Helmhart W. Shirahige K. Nasmyth K. Evidence that loading of cohesin onto chromosomes involves opening of its SMC hinge.Cell. 2006; 127: 523-537Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). Individual hinge domains have crescent shapes, and their interaction creates a pseudo-symmetric torus whose small lumen is invariably positively charged, even in fully symmetric bacterial hinges (Kurze et al., 2011Kurze A. Michie K.A. Dixon S.E. Mishra A. Itoh T. Khalid S. Strmecki L. Shirahige K. Haering C.H. Löwe J. Nasmyth K. A positively charged channel within the Smc1/Smc3 hinge required for sister chromatid cohesion.EMBO J. 2011; 30: 364-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). In this study, we addressed the nature of cohesin’s association with DNA in cells at different stages of the cell cycle or with a variety of mutations that affect loading and/or cohesion. We found that co-entrapment of sister DNAs within cohesin rings invariably accompanies sister chromatid cohesion. On the contrary, although entrapment of individual DNAs normally accompanies loading, we describe a situation where this does not apply, namely, a cohesin mutant with a hinge whose positively charged lumen has been neutralized by five mutations (smc1DDsmc3AAA). The anomalous behavior of this hinge mutant implies that cohesin is able to load onto and move along chromosomes without associating with them in a topological manner. During the course of mutating the inner surface of the hinge’s lumen, we discovered a triple mutation, replacing by aspartic acid three highly conserved lysines in Smc1, that greatly reduces cohesin’s association with chromosomes despite associating with Scc2 at CEN loading sites and being fully active as an ATPase. The behavior of this smc1DDD mutation implies that changes in the conformation of cohesin’s hinge that normally accompany ATP hydrolysis are essential for completion of the loading reaction as well as DNA entrapment. We suggest that both topological and non-topological modes of chromatin association depend on changes in cohesin’s Smc1/3 hinge domain that respond to changes in the state of its ATPase. To measure DNA entrapment by cohesin, we created a pair of strains containing 2.3 kb circular minichromosomes: a 6C strain with cysteine pairs at all three ring subunit interfaces (Smc1G22C K639C, Smc3E570C S1043C, Scc1A547C C56) and a 5C strain lacking just one of these (Scc1A547C) (Figure 1A). Exponentially growing cells were treated with the cysteine-reactive homobifunctional crosslinker bismaleimidoethane (BMOE), which circularizes 20%–25% of 6C cohesin rings (Figure S1A) (Gligoris et al., 2014Gligoris T.G.

Southern blotting revealed two forms of DNA unique to 6C cells: one that migrates slightly slower than monomeric supercoiled DNAs (CMs) and a second that migrates slower than DNA-DNA concatemers (CDs) (Figures 1A and 1B). Little if any minichromosome DNA is detected in cells lacking the affinity tag on cohesin (Figure 1B). Importantly, electrophoresis in a second dimension following proteinase K treatment confirmed that both forms consist of monomeric supercoiled DNAs: CMs are single DNA molecules trapped within cohesin rings, while CDs contain a pair of sister DNAs trapped within tripartite cohesin rings (Figure S1C).Figure S1Related to Figures 1 and 2Show full caption(A) Western blot of fully circularizable 6C wild-type cohesin crosslinked in vivo using BMOE, probed for the HA-epitope on Smc3.

To address whether CMs and CDs correspond to loading and cohesion, respectively, we measured CM and CD formation in a variety of mutants and cell-cycle states. We first asked whether mutants defective in loading fail to create CMs and CDs. Accordingly, scc2-45 cells failed to co-precipitate minichromosomes after undergoing DNA replication in the absence of functional Scc2 loader (Figure 1C). Likewise, a version of 6C cohesin that can bind but not hydrolyze ATP (Smc3E1155Q) and a version that cannot even bind ATP (Smc3K38I) failed to co-precipitate minichromosomes (Figure 1D). The formation of CMs and CDs therefore depends on both Scc2 and ATP hydrolysis. It is important to note that Smc3E1155Q cohesin associates with centromeres (CENs) with a very high efficiency, whether measured by live imaging (Hu et al., 2011Hu B. Itoh T. Mishra A. Katoh Y. Chan K.L. Upcher W. Godlee C. Roig M.B. Shirahige K. Nasmyth K. ATP hydrolysis is required for relocating cohesin from sites occupied by its Scc2/4 loading complex.Curr. Biol. 2011; 21: 12-24Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar) or by calibrated chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq) (Hu et al., 2015Hu B. Petela N. Kurze A. Chan K.L. Chapard C. Nasmyth K. Biological chromodynamics: A general method for measuring protein occupancy across the genome by calibrating ChIP-seq.Nucleic Acids Res. 2015; 43: e132PubMed Google Scholar), and yet it largely fails to immunoprecipitate CEN-containing minichromosome DNAs. If cohesion were mediated by co-entrapment of sister DNAs within cohesin rings, then CDs should be detected only in cells that have undergone DNA replication. Likewise, if cohesin loading involved entrapment of individual DNAs, then CMs should be detected in cells that load cohesin onto chromosome prior to replication. Expression of a non-degradable version of the Cdk1 inhibitor Sic1 or inactivation of the F-box protein Cdc4, which is necessary for Sic1 degradation, prevents cells from entering S phase. In both cases, the failure to degrade Sic1 was accompanied by CM but not CD formation (Figures 1E and 1F). Expression of a version of Scc1A547C C56 that cannot be cleaved by separase in α factor-arrested G1 cells also led to formation of CMs but not CDs (Figure 1G). Thus, DNA replication is required for CDs but not for CMs and the latter are not merely a byproduct of CDs. Though necessary, DNA replication is insufficient for CD formation. Thus, CDs fail to form in ts eco1-1 cells when they undergo S phase at 37°C (Figure 2A). Loading is known to take place with high efficiency in such cells despite their failure to create stable cohesion (Chan et al., 2013Chan K.L. Gligoris T. Upcher W. Kato Y. Shirahige K. Nasmyth K. Beckouët F. Pds5 promotes and protects cohesin acetylation.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2013; 110: 13020-13025Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), and indeed CM formation was unaffected (Figure 2A). The lack of CDs in eco1 mutants is due to their failure to suppress releasing activity because wpl1Δ restores efficient CD formation (Figures 2A and 2B). The correlation between CDs and cohesion was strengthened by analysis of pds5 mutants. While essential for maintaining cohesion, Pds5 is not required for loading (Panizza et al., 2000Panizza S. Tanaka T. Hochwagen A. Eisenhaber F. Nasmyth K. Pds5 cooperates with cohesin in maintaining sister chromatid cohesion.Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 1557-1564Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar, Petela et al., 2017Petela N. Gligoris T. Metson J. Lee B. Voulgaris M. Hu B. Kikuchi S. Chapard C.

Accordingly, pds5-101 cells that undergo DNA replication at 37°C form CMs but no CDs (Figure 2C). Interestingly, CM accumulation was marginally elevated in pds5-101 cells, possibly because of reduced releasing activity (Figure 2C). It has been suggested that loss of cohesion caused by inactivation of Pds5 during G2/M despite persistence of cohesin on chromosomes is evidence that cohesin cannot hold sister DNAs together by entrapping them within a single cohesin ring (Tong and Skibbens, 2014Tong K. Skibbens R.V. Cohesin without cohesion: A novel role for Pds5 in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.PLoS ONE. 2014; 9: e100470Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). To address this, we arrested 6C pds5-101 cells in G2/M at the permissive temperature and then shifted the cells to the restrictive temperature, which is known to destroy cohesion (Panizza et al., 2000Panizza S. Tanaka T. Hochwagen A. Eisenhaber F. Nasmyth K. Pds5 cooperates with cohesin in maintaining sister chromatid cohesion.Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 1557-1564Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). This led to a reduction of CDs (by 70%; 3 biological replicates) but not CMs (Figure 2D). Thus, loss of cohesion during G2/M in pds5 mutants is accompanied by loss of CDs, extending yet again the correlation between cohesion and CDs. The persistence of cohesin on chromosomes in pds5 mutants does not therefore refute the notion that cohesion is mediated by CDs. To address in a more definitive fashion whether individual hetero-trimeric rings or versions containing two or more kleisin subunits hold CDs together, we created two tetraploid strains that either contain four copies of covalently circularizable cohesin (4×6C), or three copies of 5C (lacking 1 of the 6 cysteine residues needed for complete circularization) and one copy of 6C cohesin. If individual cohesin rings held CDs together, the ratio of CDs to CMs should be unaltered by any reduction in the fraction of circularizable cohesin. However, if CDs were mediated by oligomeric cohesin containing two (or more) Scc1 subunits then the fraction should be one quarter (or less) in the case of 6C/5C/5C/5C tetraploids, compared to 4×6C controls. In fact, the ratio of CDs to CMs in both these strains was very similar in 3 biological replicates (Figure 2E; CD/CM4x6C/CD/CM1x6C,3x5C=1.01,SD=0.100). The same was true in diploid cells analyzed in a similar fashion (Figure S1H), implying that rings containing only a single copy of Scc1 hold the two DNAs within CDs together. In the course of exploring the relationship between CDs and cohesion, we analyzed cells expressing an scc1 mutant (V137K) that is defective in binding Pds5 (Chan et al., 2013Chan K.L. Gligoris T. Upcher W. Kato Y. Shirahige K. Nasmyth K. Beckouët F. Pds5 promotes and protects cohesin acetylation.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2013; 110: 13020-13025Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) and therefore lethal. To do this, we constructed a 6C V137K mutant strain that was kept alive by an untagged copy of the endogenous SCC1 gene. Due to its inability to recruit Pds5, we expected that cohesin containing Scc1V137K would be able to form CMs but not CDs. To our surprise, scc1V137K caused only a slight if any reduction in CDs (Figure 2F). This could be either because CD formation is insufficient for cohesion, or wild-type cohesin, which cannot actually be part of the CDs associated with V137K cohesin, facilitates formation of CDs by the mutant complexes. To test the latter possibility, we replaced the endogenous wild-type SCC1 with the temperature-sensitive scc1-73 allele and measured whether V137K is still capable of forming CDs when cells underwent S phase at the restrictive temperature. Under these conditions, scc1V137K supported CM but not CD formation (Figure 2G). We conclude that wild-type cohesin helps CD formation and/or maintenance by V137K cohesin. Complementation between mutant scc1 alleles had previously indicated that different cohesin complexes might interact functionally (Eng et al., 2015Eng T. Guacci V. Koshland D. Interallelic complementation provides functional evidence for cohesin-cohesin interactions on DNA.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2015; 26: 4224-4235Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), and this observation was cited as evidence that cohesion is instead mediated by a pair of cohesin complexes. Our demonstration that wild-type Scc1 enables Scc1V137K to form CDs provides an alternate interpretation; namely, that two or more cohesin rings collaborate to produce cohesive structures that contain sister DNAs held within individual rings. In a final attempt to refute the notion that CMs and CDs reflect loading and cohesion, respectively, we analyzed a quintuple mutant that neutralizes the hinge lumen’s positive charge (Figure 3A). smc1K554D K661Dsmc3R665A K668A R669A (smc1DDsmc3AAA) cohesin loads onto and moves along chromosomes in a similar manner to wild-type but fails to generate cohesion and is only poorly acetylated by Eco1 (Kurze et al., 2011Kurze A. Michie K.A. Dixon S.E. Mishra A. Itoh T. Khalid S. Strmecki L. Shirahige K. Haering C.H. Löwe J. Nasmyth K. A positively charged channel within the Smc1/Smc3 hinge required for sister chromatid cohesion.EMBO J. 2011; 30: 364-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). As expected, a 6C version of smc1DDsmc3AAA failed to produce CDs. More surprising, it also largely failed to form CMs (reduced to approximately 20% of 6C wild-type (WT) levels in the fraction of immunoprecipitated DNA; Figures 3B and S2A) despite forming tripartite rings (Figure S2B). Crucially, the level of minichromsome DNAs in smc1DDsmc3AAA immunoprecipitates was similar to WT, showing that the mutant protein associates stably with chromatin, even though it does not entrap it (Figure 3B). Calibrated ChIP-seq confirmed this result: loading of smc1DDsmc3AAA cohesin throughout the genome was similar, if not greater, than that of WT cohesin both in the presence (Figure 3C) or absence (Figure S3A) of endogenous untagged WT complexes. Calibrated ChIP-seq also showed that mutant complexes loaded at CENs migrate into neighboring sequences like WT resulting in similar distributions of the WT and mutant complexes (Figure 3C). Because loading and possibly also subsequent movement from loading sites require stimulation of cohesin’s ATPase activity by Scc2, we purified WT (SMC1 SMC3 SCC1 SCC3) and mutant (smc1DD smc3AAA SCC1 SCC3) tetramers and compared their ATPase activity in the presence of Scc2 and in the presence and absence of DNA. Crucially, smc1DDsmc3AAA had no effect on ATPase activity (Figure 3D).Figure S2Related to Figures 3, 4, 5, and 6Show full caption(A) Two replicates of the experiment performed in Figure 3B.(B) Left panel: Efficiency of the hinge crosslinking was compared between the wild-type and the DDAAA strains: Wild-type (K26085) and DDAAA (K26086"
https://openalex.org/W2765805772,"Meiotic double-strand breaks (DSBs) are generated and repaired in a highly regulated manner to ensure formation of crossovers (COs) while also enabling efficient non-CO repair to restore genome integrity. We use structured-illumination microscopy to investigate the dynamic architecture of DSB repair complexes at meiotic recombination sites in relationship to the synaptonemal complex (SC). DSBs resected at both ends are converted into inter-homolog repair intermediates harboring two populations of BLM helicase and RPA, flanking a single population of MutSγ. These intermediates accumulate until late pachytene, when repair proteins disappear from non-CO sites and CO-designated sites become enveloped by SC-central region proteins, acquire a second MutSγ population, and lose RPA. These and other data suggest that the SC may protect CO intermediates from being dismantled inappropriately and promote CO maturation by generating a transient CO-specific repair compartment, thereby enabling differential timing and outcome of repair at CO and non-CO sites."
https://openalex.org/W2800522462,"Estrogen receptor alpha (ERα) is a ligand-activated nuclear receptor that directs proliferation and differentiation in selected cancer cell types including mammary-derived carcinomas. These master-regulatory functions of ERα require trans-acting elements such as the pioneer factor FOXA1 to establish a genomic landscape conducive to ERα control. Here, we identify the H3K4 methyltransferase KMT2C as necessary for hormone-driven ERα activity and breast cancer proliferation. KMT2C knockdown suppresses estrogen-dependent gene expression and causes H3K4me1 and H3K27ac loss selectively at ERα enhancers. Correspondingly, KMT2C loss impairs estrogen-driven breast cancer proliferation but has no effect on ER- breast cells. Whereas KMT2C loss disrupts estrogen-driven proliferation, it conversely promotes tumor outgrowth under hormone-depleted conditions. In accordance, KMT2C is one of the most frequently mutated genes in ER-positive breast cancer with KMT2C deletion correlating with significantly shorter progression-free survival on anti-estrogen therapy. From a therapeutic standpoint, KMT2C-depleted cells that develop hormone-independence retain their dependence on ERα, displaying ongoing sensitivity to ERα antagonists. We conclude that KMT2C is a key regulator of ERα activity whose loss uncouples breast cancer proliferation from hormone abundance."
https://openalex.org/W2802953888,"Diverse biological systems utilize fluctuations (“noise”) in gene expression to drive lineage-commitment decisions. However, once a commitment is made, noise becomes detrimental to reliable function, and the mechanisms enabling post-commitment noise suppression are unclear. Here, we find that architectural constraints on noise suppression are overcome to stabilize fate commitment. Using single-molecule and time-lapse imaging, we find that—after a noise-driven event—human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) strongly attenuates expression noise through a non-transcriptional negative-feedback circuit. Feedback is established through a serial cascade of post-transcriptional splicing, whereby proteins generated from spliced mRNAs auto-deplete their own precursor unspliced mRNAs. Strikingly, this auto-depletion circuitry minimizes noise to stabilize HIV’s commitment decision, and a noise-suppression molecule promotes stabilization. This feedback mechanism for noise suppression suggests a functional role for delayed splicing in other systems and may represent a generalizable architecture of diverse homeostatic signaling circuits."

https://openalex.org/W2804539667,"Extensive antibiotic use over the years has led to the emergence and spread of antibiotic resistant bacteria (ARB). Antibiotic resistance poses a major threat to public health since for many infections antibiotic treatment is no longer effective. Hospitals are focal points for ARB spread. Antibiotic use in hospitals exerts selective pressure, accelerating the spread of ARB. We used an agent-based model to explore the impact of antibiotics on the transmission dynamics and to examine the potential of stewardship interventions in limiting ARB spread in a hospital. Agents in the model consist of patients and health care workers (HCW). The transmission of ARB occurs through contacts between patients and HCW and between adjacent patients. In the model, antibiotic use affects the risk of transmission by increasing the vulnerability of susceptible patients and the contagiousness of colonized patients who are treated with antibiotics. The model shows that increasing the proportion of patients receiving antibiotics increases the rate of acquisition non-linearly. The effect of antibiotics on the spread of resistance depends on characteristics of the antibiotic agent and the density of antibiotic use. Antibiotic's impact on the spread increases when the bacterial strain is more transmissible, and decreases as resistance prevalence rises. The individual risk for acquiring ARB increases in parallel with antibiotic density both for patients treated and not treated with antibiotics. Antibiotic treatment in the hospital setting plays an important role in determining the spread of resistance. Interventions to limit antibiotic use have the potential to reduce the spread of resistance, mainly by choosing an agent with a favorable profile in terms of its impact on patient's vulnerability and contagiousness. Methods to measure these impacts of antibiotics should be developed, standardized, and incorporated into drug development programs and approval packages."
https://openalex.org/W2804131104,"A universal turnaround has been detected in many countries of the World from shrinking to expanding forests. The forest area of western Europe expanded already in the 19th century. Such early trends of forest resources cannot be associated with the rapid rise of atmospheric carbon dioxide nor with the anthropogenic climate change, which have taken place since the mid 20th century. Modern, most recent spatial patterns of forest expansions and contractions do not correlate with the geography of climate trends nor with dry versus moist areas. Instead, the forest resources trends of nations correlate positively with UNDP Human Development Index. This indicates that forest resources of nations have improved along with progress in human well-being. Highly developed countries apply modern agricultural methods on good farmlands and abandon marginal lands, which become available for forest expansion. Developed countries invest in sustainable programs of forest management and nature protection. Our findings are significant for predicting the future of the terrestrial carbon sink. They suggest that the large sink of carbon recently observed in forests of the World will persist, if the well-being of people continues to improve. However, despite the positive trends in domestic forests, developed nations increasingly outsource their biomass needs abroad through international trade, and all nations rely on unsustainable energy use and wasteful patterns of material consumption."
https://openalex.org/W2804214951,"We investigated whether rapamycin-insensitive mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling plays a role in regulating resistance exercise-induced muscle protein synthesis. We used a rodent model of resistance exercise and compared the effect of rapamycin, an allosteric mTOR inhibitor, with the effect of AZD8055, an ATP-competitive mTOR kinase inhibitor. The right gastrocnemius muscle of male Sprague-Dawley rats age 11 wk was contracted isometrically via percutaneous electrical stimulation (100 Hz, 5 sets of ten 3-s contractions, 7 s of rest between contractions, 3 min of rest between sets), and the left gastrocnemius muscle served as control. Vehicle, rapamycin, or AZD8055 were intraperitoneally injected 1 h before resistance exercise. Results indicated that both rapamycin and AZD8055 inhibited mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1)/70-kDa ribosomal protein S6 kinase signaling similarly, whereas mTORC1/eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E-binding protein 1 signaling was greatly inhibited by AZD8055. Moreover, only AZD8055 inhibited the phosphorylation of Akt at Ser473, a downstream target of mTORC2. AZD8055, but not rapamycin, completely inhibited the resistance exercise-induced increase in muscle protein synthesis. We conclude that the resistance exercise-induced increase in muscle protein synthesis is an mTOR signaling-dependent process. Furthermore, both rapamycin-sensitive and -insensitive mTOR signaling regulate this event.-Ogasawara, R., Suginohara, T. Rapamycin-insensitive mechanistic target of rapamycin regulates basal and resistance exercise-induced muscle protein synthesis."
https://openalex.org/W2801274882,"Intrinsic and acquired resistance to anti-EGFR antibody therapy, frequently mediated by a mutant or amplified KRAS oncogene, is a significant challenge in the treatment of colorectal cancer (CRC). However, the mechanism of KRAS-mediated therapeutic resistance is not well understood. In this study, we demonstrate that clinically used anti-EGFR antibodies, including cetuximab and panitumumab, induce killing of sensitive CRC cells through p73-dependent transcriptional activation of the pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 family protein PUMA. PUMA induction and p73 activation are abrogated in CRC cells with acquired resistance to anti-EGFR antibodies due to KRAS alterations. Inhibition of aurora kinases preferentially kills mutant KRAS CRC cells and overcomes KRAS-mediated resistance to anti-EGFR antibodies in vitro and in vivo by restoring PUMA induction. Our results suggest that PUMA plays a critical role in meditating the sensitivity of CRC cells to anti-EGFR antibodies, and that restoration of PUMA-mediated apoptosis is a promising approach to improve the efficacy of EGFR-targeted therapy."
https://openalex.org/W2803529364,"Capsicum baccatum is one of the main pepper species grown and consumed in South America. In Brazil, it is commonly cultivated by family farmers, using mostly the genotypes bishop's hat genotypes (locally cambuci) and red chili pepper (dedo-de-moça). This study had the objective of characterizing 116 C. baccatum accessions from different regions of Brazil, based on morphological fruit descriptors and AFLP (Amplified Fragment Length Polymorphisms) markers. Broad phenotypic variability among the C. baccatum accessions was detected when using morphological fruit descriptors. The Ward modified location model (Ward-MLM) discriminated five groups, based mainly on fruit shape. Six combinations of AFLP primers detected polymorphism in 97.93% of the 2466 identified bands, indicating the high genetic variability in the accessions. The UPGMA coincided with the Bayesian clustering analysis and three large groups were formed, separating the wild variety C. baccatum var. praetermissum from the other accessions. There was no relation between genetic distance and geographical origin of the accessions, probably due to the intense exchange of fruits and seeds between farmers. Morphological descriptors used together with AFLP markers proved efficient in detecting the levels of genetic variability among the accessions maintained in the germplasm collections. These results can be used as an additional source of helpful information to be exploited in C. baccatum breeding programs."
https://openalex.org/W2803467742,"Background School dropout has been linked to early pregnancy and marriage but less is known about the effect of school performance. We aimed to assess whether school performance influenced age at sexual debut, pregnancy and marriage, and from what age school drop-out and performance were associated with these later life events. Methods Data from 2007–2016 from a demographic surveillance site in northern Malawi with annual updating of schooling status and grades, and linked sexual behaviour surveys, were analysed to assess the associations of age-specific school performance (measured as age-for-grade) and status (in or out of school) on subsequent age at sexual debut, pregnancy and marriage. Landmark analysis with Cox regression was used to estimate hazard ratios of sexual debut, pregnancy and marriage by schooling at selected (landmark) ages, controlling for socio-economic factors. Results Information on at least one outcome was available for >16,000 children seen at ages 10–18. Sexual debut was available on a subset aged ≥15 by 2011. For girls, being out of school was strongly associated with earlier sexual debut, pregnancy and marriage. For example, using schooling status at age 14, compared to girls in primary, those who had dropped out had adjusted hazard ratios of subsequent sexual debut, pregnancy and marriage of 5.39 (95% CI 3.27–8.86), 2.39 (1.82–3.12), and 2.76 (2.08–3.67) respectively. For boys, the equivalent association with sexual debut was weak, 1.92 (0.81–4.55), but that with marriage was strong, 3.74 (2.28–6.11), although boys married later. Being overage-for-grade was not associated with sexual debut for girls or boys. For girls, being overage-for-grade from age 10 was associated with earlier pregnancy and marriage (e.g. adjusted hazard ratio 2.84 (1.32–6.17) for pregnancy and 3.19 (1.47–6.94) for marriage, for those ≥3 years overage compared to those on track at age 10). For boys, overage-for-grade was associated with earlier marriage from age 12, with stronger associations at older ages (e.g. adjusted hazard ratio 2.41 (1.56–3.70) for those ≥3 years overage compared to those on track at age 14). For girls ≥3 years overage at age 14, 39% were pregnant before they were 18, compared to 18% of those who were on track. The main limitation was the use of reported ages of sexual debut, pregnancy and marriage. Conclusions School progression at ages as young as 10 can predict teenage pregnancy and marriage, even after adjusting for socio-economic factors. Early education interventions may reduce teenage pregnancy and marriage as well as improving learning."
https://openalex.org/W2803419811,"The population is aging rapidly in many developed countries. Such countries need to respond to the growing demand and expanding costs of healthcare (HC) for the elderly. Therefore, it is important to investigate the factors correlating such HC costs. In Japan, HC is composed of two sections, namely medical care (MC) and long-term care (LTC). While many studies have examined MC and LTC costs on their own, few studies have conducted comprehensive investigations of HC costs. The aim of this study is to examine the risk factors that influence HC costs for the elderly who enroll in the LTC insurance system in Japan.The inclusion criteria in the present study are as follows: being 65 years of age, or older; certified eligibility for, and use of services offered by the LTC insurance system at home or in an institutional setting in December 2009; and being covered by the National Health Insurance (NHI) system. MC and LTC insurance data were obtained from claim records for the elderly in July and December of 2007, 2008, and 2009 (i.e., a total of six survey points). Panel data, per subject, were constructed using MC and LTC claim records. The sample included 810 subjects and 4029 observations.We estimated a regression equation with a censored dependent variable using a Tobit model. Significant associations between MC or LTC costs and interaction terms (household composition × seasonal effects) were investigated. MC costs significantly decreased and LTC costs significantly increased among subjects living alone during winter. Income level was also a positive determinant of MC costs, while eligibility level was a positive determinant of LTC costs.We recommend that the health policy for the elderly focus more on seasonal effects, household composition, and income level, as well as on eligibility level."
https://openalex.org/W2799398973,"We have identified an epidermal cancer stem (ECS) cell population that drives formation of rapidly growing and highly invasive and vascularized tumors. VEGF-A and neuropilin-1 (NRP-1) are highly expressed in ECS cell tumors and VEGF-A/NRP-1 interaction is required for ECS cell survival and tumor vascularization. We now identify a novel signaling cascade that is triggered by VEGF-A/NRP-1. We show that NRP-1 forms a complex with GIPC1 and α6/β4-integrin to activate FAK/Src signaling, which leads to stabilization of a YAP1/∆Np63α to enhance ECS cell survival, invasion, and angiogenesis. Loss of NRP-1, GIPC1, α6/β4-integrins, YAP1, or ∆Np63α reduces these responses. Moreover, restoration of constituently active YAP1 or ∆Np63α in NRP-1 null cells restores the ECS cell phenotype. Tumor xenograft experiments show that NRP-1 knockout ECS cells form small tumors characterized by reduced vascularization as compared to wild-type cells. The NRP-1 knockout tumors display signaling changes consistent with a role for the proposed signaling cascade. These studies suggest that VEGF-A interacts with NRP-1 and GIPC1 to regulate α6/β4-integrin, FAK, Src, PI3K/PDK1, LATS1 signaling to increase YAP1/∆Np63α accumulation to drive ECS cell survival, angiogenesis, and tumor formation."

However, the molecular mechanisms regulating this signalling network are not completely defined. By conducting transcriptome analysis, denaturing immunoprecipitations and immunopathology, we demonstrate that the TP53-MDM2-AR-AKT cross-talk is regulated by the deubiquitinating enzyme USP12 in prostate cancer. Our findings explain why USP12 is one of the 12 most commonly overexpressed cancer-associated genes located near an amplified super-enhancer. We find that USP12 deubiquitinates MDM2 and AR, which in turn controls the levels of the TP53 tumour suppressor and AR oncogene in prostate cancer. Consequently, USP12 levels are predictive not only of cancer development but also of patient’s therapy resistance, relapse and survival. Therefore, our findings suggest that USP12 could serve as a promising therapeutic target in currently incurable castrate-resistant prostate cancer."

To this end, the virulence potential of 18 E. coli APN strains was genotypically and phenotypically assessed, comparatively with 19 strains causing recurrent cystitis (RC), and 16 clinically not significant (control, CO) strains. Most of the strains belong to phylogenetic group B1 (69.8%; p<0.01), and APN strains showed unique features, which are the presence of phylogroup A, and the absence of phylogroup B2 and non-typeable strains. Overall, the most dominant virulence factor genes (VFGs) were ecpA and fyuA (92.4 and 86.7%, respectively; p<0.05), and the mean number of VFGs was significantly higher in uropathogenic strains. Particularly, papAH and malX were exclusive for uropathogenic strains. APN and RC strains showed a significantly higher prevalence of fyuA, usp, and malX than of CO strains. Compared to RC strains, APN ones showed a higher prevalence of iha, but a lower prevalence of iroN, cnf1, and kpsMT-II. Hierarchical cluster analysis showed a higher proportion of two gene clusters (malX and usp, and fyuA and ecpA) were detected in the APN and RC groups than in CO, whereas iutA and iha clusters were detected more frequently in APN strains. The motility level did not differ among the study-groups and phylogroups considered, although a higher proportion of swarming strains was observed in APN strains. Antibiotic-resistance rates were generally low except for ampicillin (37.7%), and were not associated with specific study- or phylogenetic groups. APN and RC strains produced more biofilm than CO strains. In APN strains, iha was associated with higher biofilm biomass formation, whereas iroN and KpSMT-K1 were associated with a lower amount of biofilm biomass. Further work is needed to grasp the virulence and fitness mechanisms adopted by E. coli causing APN, and hence develop new therapeutic and prophylactic approaches."
https://openalex.org/W2801658540,"The Chloride Channel Accessory (CLCA) protein family was first characterized as regulators of calcium-activated chloride channel (CaCC) currents (ICaCC), but the mechanism has not been fully established. We hypothesized that CLCAs might regulate ICaCC by modulating intracellular calcium levels. In cells stably expressing human CLCA2 or vector, we found by calcium imaging that CLCA2 moderately enhanced intracellular-store release but dramatically increased store-operated entry of calcium upon cytosolic depletion. Moreover, another family member, CLCA1, produced similar effects on intracellular calcium mobilization. Co-immunoprecipitation revealed that CLCA2 interacted with the plasma membrane store-operated calcium channel ORAI-1 and the ER calcium sensor STIM-1. The effect of CLCA2 on ICaCC was tested in HEK293 stably expressing calcium-activated chloride channel TMEM16A. Co-expression of CLCA2 nearly doubled ICaCC in response to a calcium ionophore. These results unveil a new mechanism by which CLCA family members activate ICaCC and suggest a broader role in calcium-dependent processes."
https://openalex.org/W2803874440,"Background Malaria rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) can produce false positive (FP) results in patients with human African trypanosomiasis and rheumatoid factor (RF), but specificity against other infectious agents and immunological factors is largely unknown. Low diagnostic specificity caused by cross-reactivity may lead to over-estimates of the number of malaria cases and over-use of antimalarial drugs, at the cost of not diagnosing and treating the true underlying condition. Methods Data from the WHO Malaria RDT Product Testing Programme was analysed to assess FP rates of 221 RDTs against four infectious agents (Chagas, dengue, Leishmaniasis and Schistosomiasis) and four immunological factors (anti-nuclear antibody, human anti-mouse antibody (HAMA), RF and rapid plasma regain). Only RDTs with a FP rate against clean negative samples less than 10% were included. Paired t-tests were used to compare product-specific FP rates on clean negative samples and samples containing non-Plasmodium infectious agents and immunological factors. Results Forty (18%) RDTs showed no FP results against any tested infectious agent or immunological factor. In the remaining RDTs significant and clinically relevant increases in FP rates were observed for samples containing HAMA and RF (P<0.001). There were significant correlations between product-matched FP rates for RF and HAMA on all RDT test bands (P<0.001), and FP rates for each infectious agent and immunological factor were also correlated between test bands of combination RDTs (P≤0.002). Conclusions False positive results against non-Plasmodium infectious agents and immunological factors does not appear to be a universal property of malaria RDTs. However, since many malaria RDTs have elevated FP rates against HAMA and RF positive samples practitioners may need to consider the possibility of false positive results for malaria in patients with conditions that stimulate HAMA or RF."
https://openalex.org/W2803932018,"HIV acquisition during pregnancy and breastfeeding significantly contributes toward paediatric HIV infection; however, little is known about risk behaviours in HIV-uninfected pregnant and postpartum women. We conducted twenty-six in-depth-interviews between July and December 2016 using a semi-structured interview guide among HIV-uninfected pregnant and recently postpartum women at-risk of HIV acquisition (defined as reporting ≥1 of the following: partner’s serostatus unknown or HIV-infected, recent condomless sex in pregnancy, and/or alcohol use during pregnancy) who attended primary healthcare services. Our study contextualizes factors related to risky sexual behaviours during pregnancy and postpartum periods and assesses knowledge and hypothetical acceptability of pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) in pregnancy. Translated and transcribed data were coded and analysed by three researchers using a thematic analysis approach. In interviews with HIV-uninfected pregnant/postpartum women at-risk of HIV acquisition, we identified common themes associated with sexual risk behaviours during pregnancy, including: lack of control over decisions in sex and condom use in pregnancy, low perceived risk (e.g. beliefs that their partner has the same HIV-negative serostatus), and socio-cultural beliefs around condom use during pregnancy (e.g. contact with sperm is essential for baby’s development). PrEP knowledge was low among HIV-uninfected pregnant and breastfeeding women, and potential acceptability was good, though primary concerns were around the potential impact on the infant. While mothers presented a clear desire to protect themselves from HIV acquisition once pregnant, they also reported lack of control, and socio-cultural beliefs, like sex is good for the baby, that increased their risk of seroconversion. Mothers had limited PrEP awareness but reported hypothetical willingness to use PrEP because of concerns over HIV acquisition and onward mother to child transmission."
https://openalex.org/W2800058658,"Preeclampsia is a major cause of maternal and perinatal deaths. The aetiology of preeclampsia is largely unknown but a polygenetic component is assumed. To explore this hypothesis, we performed an in-depth whole-exome sequencing study in women with (cases, N = 50) and without (controls, N = 50) preeclampsia. The women were identified in an unselected cohort of 2,545 pregnant women based on data from the Danish National Patient Registry and the Medical Birth Registry. Matching DNA was obtained from a biobank containing excess blood from routine antenatal care visits. Novogene performed the whole-exome sequencing blinded to preeclampsia status. Variants for comparison between cases and controls were filtered in the Ingenuity Variant Analysis software. We applied two different strategies; a disease association panel approach, which included variants in single genes associated with established clinical risk factors for preeclampsia, and a gene panel approach, which included biological pathways harbouring genes previously reported to be associated with preeclampsia. Variant variability was compared in cases and controls at the level of biological processes, signalling pathways, and in single genes. Regardless of the applied strategy and the level of variability examined, we consistently found positive correlations between variant numbers in cases and controls (all R2s>0.88). Contrary to what was expected, cases carried fewer variants in biological processes and signalling pathways than controls (all p-values ≤0.02). In conclusion, our findings challenge the hypothesis of a polygenetic aetiology for preeclampsia with a common network of susceptibility genes. The greater genetic diversity among controls may suggest a protective role of genetic diversity against the development of preeclampsia."
https://openalex.org/W2801628865,"Objective It has been previously demonstrated that T lymphocytes may be involved in the development of hypertension and microvascular remodeling, and that circulating T effector lymphocytes may be increased in hypertension. In particular, Th1 and Th 17 lymphocytes may contribute to the progression of hypertension and microvascular damage while T-regulatory (Treg) lymphocytes seem to be protective in this regard. However, no data is available about patients with severe obesity, in which pronounced microvascular alterations were observed. Design and methods We have investigated 32 severely obese patients undergoing bariatric surgery, as well as 24 normotensive lean subjects and 12 hypertensive lean subjects undergoing an elective surgical intervention. A peripheral blood sample was obtained before surgery for assessment of CD4+ T lymphocyte subpopulations. Lymphocyte phenotype was evaluated by flow cytometry in order to assess T-effector and Treg lymphocytes. Results A marked reduction of several Treg subpopulations was observed in obese patients compared with controls, together with an increased in CD4+ effector memory T-effector cells. Conclusion In severely obese patients, Treg lymphocytes are clearly reduced and CD4+ effector memory cells are increased. It may be hypothesized that they might contribute to the development of marked microvascular alterations previously observed in these patients."
https://openalex.org/W2800166748,"Oxygen is required for the completion of almost all known metazoan lifecycles, but many metazoans harbour abilities to withstand varying degrees and periods of hypoxia. Caenorhabditis elegans, one of the most popular model organism is extensively used as a model for the study of hypoxia and anoxia biology and it has been found that this nematode is capable of tolerance to varying degrees of hypoxia. Considering the extremely high diversity of nematodes, the effects of low oxygen concentration and mechanisms of adaptation to oxygen depletion differ among species. In this study, we used a simple assay to examine anoxia tolerance in four nematode species, including three free-living and one plant parasitic nematode. We found that the plant parasitic nematode Bursaphelenchus xylophilus can survive more than 14 days under anoxic conditions. Comparisons of behaviour during anoxia induction and the repertoire of oxygen sensation genes among the tested species suggested the existence of different oxygen sensation systems between B. xylophilus and C. elegans, which quickly introduce suspended animation in response to oxygen depletion to survive long-term anoxia."
https://openalex.org/W2803143862,"Hematopoiesis is an essential and highly regulated biological process that begins with hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). In healthy organisms, HSCs are responsible for generating a multitude of mature blood cells every day, yet the molecular pathways that instruct HSCs to self-renew and differentiate into post-mitotic blood cells are not fully known. To understand these molecular pathways, we investigated novel genes expressed in hematopoietic-supportive cell lines from the zebrafish (Danio rerio), a model system increasingly utilized to uncover molecular pathways important in the development of other vertebrate species. We performed RNA sequencing of the transcriptome of three stromal cell lines derived from different stages of embryonic and adult zebrafish and identified hundreds of highly expressed transcripts. For our studies, we focused on isthmin 1 (ism1) due to its shared synteny with its human gene ortholog and because it is a secreted protein. To characterize ism1, we performed loss-of-function experiments to identify if mature blood cell production was disrupted. Myeloid and erythroid lineages were visualized and scored with transgenic zebrafish expressing lineage-specific markers. ism1 knockdown led to reduced numbers of neutrophils, macrophages, and erythrocytes. Analysis of clonal methylcellulose assays from ism1 morphants also showed a reduction in total hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs). Overall, we demonstrate that ism1 is required for normal generation of HSPCs and their downstream progeny during zebrafish hematopoiesis. Further investigation into ism1 and its importance in hematopoiesis may elucidate evolutionarily conserved processes in blood formation that can be further investigated for potential clinical utility."
https://openalex.org/W2802411693,"Adult height is determined by both genetic characteristics and environmental factors in early life. Although previous studies have suggested that adult height is associated with risk of mortality, comprehensive associations between height and all-cause and cause-specific mortality in the Japanese population are unclear. We aimed to evaluate the associations between adult height and all-cause and cause-specific mortality among Japanese men and women in a prospective cohort study. We investigated 107,794 participants (50,755 men and 57,039 women) aged 40 to 69 years who responded to the baseline questionnaire in the Japan Public Health Center-based Prospective Study. Participants were classified by quartile of adult height obtained from a self-reported questionnaire in men (<160cm, 160-163cm, 164-167cm, ≥168cm) and women (<149cm, 149-151cm, 152-155cm, ≥156cm). Hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for mortality from all-cause, cancer, heart disease, cerebrovascular disease, respiratory disease, and other cause mortality were calculated using Cox proportional hazards models. During follow-up, 12,320 men and 7,030 women died. Taller adult height was associated with decreased risk for mortality from cerebrovascular disease (HR <160cm vs. ≥168cm (95% CI) = 0.83 (0.69-0.99); HR for 5-cm increment (95% CI) = 0.95 (0.90-0.99)) and respiratory disease (HR <160cm vs. ≥168cm (95% CI) = 0.84 (0.69-1.03); HR for 5-cm increment (95% CI) = 0.92 (0.87-0.97)), but was also associated with increased risk for overall cancer mortality (HR <160cm vs. ≥168cm (95% CI) = 1.17 (1.07-1.28); HR for 5-cm increment (95% CI) = 1.04 (1.01-1.07)) in men. Taller adult height was also associated with decreased risk for mortality from cerebrovascular disease (HR <149cm vs. ≥156cm (95% CI) = 0.84 (0.66-1.05); HR for 5-cm increment (95% CI) = 0.92 (0.86-0.99)) in women. Our results confirmed that adult height is associated with cause-specific mortality in a Japanese population."
https://openalex.org/W2803128222,"The present study was performed to establish a novel ocular surgery simulator for training in peeling of the inner limited membrane (ILM). This simulator included a next-generation artificial ILM with mechanical properties similar to the natural ILM that could be peeled underwater in the same manner as in actual surgery. An artificial eye consisting of a fundus and eyeball parts was fabricated. The artificial eye was installed in the eye surgery simulator. The fundus part was mounted in the eyeball, which consisted of an artificial sclera, retina, and ILM. To measure the thickness of the fabricated ILM on the artificial retina, we calculated the distance of the step height as the thickness of the artificial ILM. Two experienced ophthalmologists then assessed the fabricated ILM by sensory evaluation. The minimum thickness of the artificial ILM was 1.9 ± 0.3 μm (n = 3). We were able to perform the peeling task with the ILM in water. Based on the sensory evaluation, an ILM with a minimum thickness and 1000 degrees of polymerization was suitable for training. We installed the eye model on an ocular surgery simulator, which allowed for the performance of a sequence of operations similar to ILM peeling. In conclusion, we developed a novel ocular surgery simulator for ILM peeling. The artificial ILM was peeled underwater in the same manner as in an actual operation."
https://openalex.org/W2804198305,"In cancer cells, global genomic hypomethylation is found together with localized hypermethylation of CpG islands within the promoters and regulatory regions of silenced tumor suppressor genes. Demethylating agents may reverse hypermethylation, thus promoting gene re-expression. Unfortunately, demethylating strategies are not efficient in solid tumor cells. DNA demethylation is mediated by ten-eleven translocation (TET) enzymes. They sequentially convert 5-methylcytosine (5mC) to 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC), which is associated with active transcription; 5-formylcytosine; and finally, 5-carboxylcytosine. Although α-linolenic acid, eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), and docosahexaenoic acid, the major n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids, have anti-cancer effects, their action, as DNA-demethylating agents, has never been investigated in solid tumor cells. Here, we report that EPA demethylates DNA in hepatocarcinoma cells. EPA rapidly increases 5hmC on DNA, inducing p21Waf1/Cip1 gene expression, which slows cancer cell-cycle progression. We show that the underlying molecular mechanism involves TET1. EPA si multaneously binds peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ) and retinoid X receptor α (RXRα), thus promoting their heterodimer and inducing a PPARγ-TET1 interaction. They generate a TET1-PPARγ-RXRα pro tein complex, which binds to a hypermethylated CpG island on the p21 gene, where TET1 converts 5mC to 5hmC. In an apparent shuttling motion, PPARγ and RXRα leave the DNA, whereas TET1 associates stably. Overall, EPA directly regulates DNA methylation levels, permitting TET1 to exert its anti-tumoral function.—Ceccarelli, V., Valentini, V., Ronchetti, S., Cannarile, L., Billi, M., Riccardi, C., Ottini, L., Talesa, V.

https://openalex.org/W2799658084,"Background Effective HIV prevention requires efficient delivery of safe and efficacious drugs and optimization of user adherence. The user’s experiences with the drug, delivery system, and use parameters are critical to product acceptability and adherence. Prevention product developers have the opportunity to directly control a drug delivery system and its impact on acceptability and adherence, as well as product efficacy. Involvement of potential users during preclinical design and development can facilitate this process. We embedded a mixed methods user evaluation study into a safety and pharmacokinetics (PK) trial of a pod-intravaginal ring delivering antiretroviral agents. Methodology Women enrolled in two cohorts, ultimately evaluating the safety/PK of a pod-IVRs delivering TDF-alone, TDF-FTC, and/or TDF-FTC-MVC. A 7-day use period was targeted for each pod-IVR, regardless of drug or drug combination. During the clinical study, participants provided both quantitative (i.e., survey) and qualitative (i.e., in-depth interview) data capturing acceptability, perceptibility, and adherence behaviors. Initial sexual and reproductive health history surveys, daily diaries, a final acceptability and willingness to use survey, and a qualitative in-depth interview comprised the user evaluation data for each pod-IVR experienced by the participants. Findings Overall, the majority of participants (N = 10) reported being willing to use the pod-IVR platform for HIV prevention should it advance to market. Confidence to use the pod-IVR (e.g., insertion, removal) was high. There were no differences noted in the user experience of the pod-IVR platform; that is, whether the ring delivered TDF-alone, TDF-FTC, or TDF-FTC-MVC, users’ experiences of the ring were similar and acceptable. Participants did report specific experiences, both sensory and behavioral, that impacted their use behaviors with respect to the ring, and which could ultimately impact acceptability and adherence. These experiences, and user evaluations elicited by them, could both challenge use or be used to leverage use in future trials and product rollout once fully articulated. Conclusions High willingness-to-use data and lack of salient differences in user experiences related to use of the pod-IVR platform (regardless of agents delivered) suggests that the pod-IVR is a feasible and acceptable drug delivery device in and of itself. This finding holds promise both for an anti-HIV pod-IVR and, potentially, a multipurpose prevention pod-IVR that could deliver both prevention for sexually transmitted infections (STIs) including HIV and contraception. Given the very early clinical trial context, further acceptability, perceptibility, and adherence data should continue to be explored, in the context of longer use periods (e.g., 28-day ring use), and in the contexts of sexual activity and menses. Using early design and development contexts to gain insights into potential challenges and facilitators of drug delivery systems such as the pod-IVR could save valuable resources and time as a potential biomedical technology moves through the clinical trial pipeline and into real-world use."
https://openalex.org/W2529436619,"The use of remote sensing techniques allows monitoring of photosynthesis at the ecosystem level and improves our knowledge of plant primary productivity. The main objective of the current study was to develop a remote sensing based method to measure microphytobenthos (MPB) primary production from intertidal mudflats. This was achieved by coupling hyperspectral radiometry (reflectance, ρ and second derivative, δδ) and PAM-fluorometry (non-sequential light curves, NSLC) measurements. The latter allowed the estimation of primary production using a light use efficiency parameter (LUE) and electron transport rates (ETR) whereas ρ allowed to estimate pigment composition and optical absorption cross-section (a*). Five MPB species representative of the main growth forms: epipelic (benthic motile), epipsammic (benthic motile and non motile) and tychoplanktonic (temporarily resuspended in the water column) were submitted to increasing light intensities from dark to 1950 μmol photons.m-2.s-1. Different fluorescence patterns were observed for the three growth-forms and were linked to their xanthophyll cycle (de-epoxydation state). After spectral reflectance measurements, a* was retrieved using a radiative transfer model and several radiometric indices were tested for their capacity to predict LUE and ETR measured by PAM-fluorometry. Only one radiometric index was not species or growth-form specific, i.e. δδ496/508. This index was named MPBLUE and could be used to predict LUE and ETR. The applicability of this index was tested with simulated bands of a wide variety of hyperspectral sensors at spectral resolutions between 3 and 15 nm of Full Width at Half Maximum (FWHM)."
https://openalex.org/W2803144492,"Around 63% of total health care expenditure in Bangladesh is mitigated through out of pocket payment (OOP). Heavy reliance on OOP at the time of care seeking poses great threat for financial impoverishment of the households. Households employ different strategies to cope with the associated financial hardship.The aim of this paper is to understand the determinants of hardship financing in coping with OOP adopted for health care seeking of under five childhood illnesses in rural setting of Bangladesh.A community based cross sectional survey was conducted during August to October, 2014 in 15 low performing sub-districts of northern and north-east regions of Bangladesh. Of the 7039 mothers of under five children surveyed, 1895 children who suffered from illness and sought care for their illness episodes were reported in this study. Descriptive statistics and ordinal regression analysis were conducted.A total number of 7,039 under five children reported to have suffered illness by their mothers. Among these children 37% suffered from priority illness. Care was sought for 88% children suffering from illnesses. Among them 26% went to a public or private sector medically trained provider. 5% of households incurred illness cost more than 10% of the household's monthly expenditure. The need for assistance was higher among those compared to others (31% vs 13%). Different financing mechanisms adopted to meet OOP are loan with interest (6%), loan without interest (9%) and financial help from relatives (6%) Need for financial assistance varied from 19% among households in the lowest quintile to 9% in the highest wealth. Ordinal regression analysis revealed that burden of hardship financing increases by 2.17 times when care is sought from a private trained provider compared to care seeking from untrained provider (CI: 1.49, 3.17). Similarly, for families that incur a health care expenditure that is more than 10% of their total monthly expenditure (CI:1.46, 3.88), the probability of falling into more severe financial burden increases by 2.4 times. We also found severity of the hardship financing to be around half for households with monthly income of more than BDT 7500 (OR = 0.56, CI: 0.37, 0.86). The burden increased by 2.10 times for households with a deficit (CI: 1.53, 2.88) between their monthly income and expenditure. The interaction between family income and severity of illness showed to significantly affect the scale of hardship financing. Children suffering from priority illness belonging to poor households were found have two times (CI: 1.09, 3.47) higher risks of suffering from hardship financing.Findings from this study will help the policy makers to identify the target groups and thereby design effective health financing programs."
https://openalex.org/W2803230042,"Background The preemptive multimodal pain protocols used in total knee arthroplasty (TKA) often cause emesis postoperatively. We investigated whether palonosetron prophylaxis reduces postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) in high-risk patients after TKA. Methods We randomized 120 female patients undergoing TKA to receive either palonosetron (0.075 mg, intravenous) or no antiemetic prophylaxis (0.9% saline, control group). All patients were given spinal anesthesia, a continuous femoral nerve block, and fentanyl-based intravenous patient controlled analgesia. Patients undergoing staged bilateral TKA were assigned to one group for the first knee and the other group for the second knee. The overall incidence of PONV, the incidences of both nausea and vomiting, severity of nausea, complete response, requirement for rescue antiemetics, pain level, opioid consumption, and satisfaction scores were evaluated during three periods: 0–2, 2–24, and 24–48 h postoperatively. We also compared PONV and pain between the first and second TKA. Results The incidence of PONV during the first 48 h was lower in the palonosetron group compared with the controls (22 vs. 41%, p = 0.028), especially 2–24 h after surgery, as was the nausea and vomiting respectively. The severity of nausea was lower in the palonosetron group (p = 0.010). The complete response rate (93 vs. 73%, p = 0.016) and satisfaction score (84 ± 12 vs. 79 ± 15, p = 0.032) were higher in the palonosetron group during 2–24 h after surgery. Patients who underwent a second operation complained of more severe pain, and consumed more opioids than those of the first operation. There was no difference in the incidence of PONV between the first and second operations. Conclusions Palonosetron prophylaxis reduced the incidence and severity of PONV in high-risk patients managed with multimodal pain protocol for 48 h, notably 2–24 h after TKA."
https://openalex.org/W2801805677,"The bacterial soluble lytic transglycosylase (LT) breaks down the peptidoglycan (PG) layer during processes such as cell division. We present here crystal structures of the soluble LT Cj0843 from Campylobacter jejuni with and without bulgecin A inhibitor in the active site. Cj0843 has a doughnut shape similar but not identical to that of E. coli SLT70. The C-terminal catalytic domain is preceded by an L-domain, a large helical U-domain, a flexible linker, and a small N-terminal NU-domain. The flexible linker allows the NU-domain to reach over and complete the circular shape, using residues conserved in the Epsilonproteobacteria LT family. The inner surface of the Cj0843 doughnut is mostly positively charged including a pocket that has 8 Arg/Lys residues. Molecular dynamics simulations with PG strands revealed a potential functional role for this pocket in anchoring the negatively charged terminal tetrapeptide of the PG during several steps in the reaction including homing and aligning the PG strand for exolytic cleavage, and subsequent ratcheting of the PG strand to enhance processivity in degrading PG strands."
https://openalex.org/W2803680145,"Immunogenicity is a major concern in drug development as anti-drug antibodies in many cases affect both patient safety and drug efficacy. Another concern is often the limited half-life of drugs, which can be altered by different chemical modifications, like acylation with fatty acids. However, acylation with fatty acids has been shown in some cases to modulate T cell activation. Therefore, to understand the role of acylation with fatty acids on immunogenicity we tested three immunogenic non-acylated peptides and 14 of their acylated analogues for binding to 26 common HLA class II alleles, and their ability to activate T cells in an ex vivo T cell assay. Changes in binding affinity associated with acylation with fatty acids were typically modest, though a significant decrease was observed for influenza HA acylated with a stearic acid, and affinities for DQ alleles were consistently increased. Importantly, we showed that for all three immunogenic peptides acylation with fatty acids decreased their capacity to activate T cells, a trend particularly evident with longer fatty acids typically positioned within the peptide HLA class II binding core region, or when closer to the C-terminus. With these results we have demonstrated that acylation with fatty acids of immunogenic peptides can lower their stimulatory capacity, which could be important knowledge for drug design and immunogenicity mitigation."
https://openalex.org/W2803775007,"Introduction To highlight the differences in macular pigment optical density (MPOD) between eyes with vitreoretinal interface syndrome and healthy control eyes, to assess the changes in MPOD in eyes treated with macular peeling, to investigate the relationships between MPOD changes and measures of retinal sensitivity such as best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) and microperimetry. Methods In this cross-sectional comparative study, 30 eyes affected by idiopathic epiretinal membrane (iERM, 15eyes) or full-thickness macular hole (FTMH, 15eyes) were compared with 60 eyes from 30 healthy age-matched patients. MPOD values (mean MPOD, maximum MPOD, MPOD area, and MPOD volume) were measured in a range of 4°–7° of eccentricity around the fovea, using the one-wavelength reflectometry method (Visucam 200, Carl-Zeiss Meditec). Patients affected by iERM and FTMH were treated with vitrectomy and epiretinal membrane-inner limiting membrane (ERM-ILM) peeling, with follow-up examinations performed preoperatively and 6 months postoperatively. The main outcome measures were the differences in MPOD between eyes with vitreoretinal interface syndrome and healthy eyes, changes in MPOD after ERM-ILM peeling, and relationships between MPOD and functional changes. Results Mean MPOD differed significantly between control eyes and those with iERM (P = .0001) or FTMH (P = .0006). The max MPOD and MPOD area increased, but not significantly. After peeling, the only significant change in MPOD was in MPOD volume (P = .01). In the ERM group, postoperative mean MPOD correlated significantly with best-corrected visual acuity (r = .739, P = .002). Conclusions MPOD was reduced in patients with iERM or FTMH compared with healthy eyes. We found a significant correlation between the mean postoperative MPOD and postoperative BCVA, hypothesizing that the postoperative increase in mean MPOD could be due to a change in distribution for unfolding and expansion of the fovea after the peeling. MOPD may be considered as a prognostic factor associated with a good visual prognosis in patients with iERM."

A seven-dimension team resuscitation SA framework was developed following a literature review and consensus process using a modified Delphi approach with a group of content experts. We applied a pre-post design within a day-long team training program involving four video-recorded simulated resuscitation events and 42 teams across Canada. The first and fourth events represented “pre” and “post” training events, respectively. Teams were scored on SA five times within each 15-minute event.

https://openalex.org/W2804281442,"Gene-gene and gene-environment interactions may be partially responsible for dyslipidemia, but studies investigating interactions in the reverse cholesterol transport system (RCT) are limited. We explored these interactions in a Xinjiang rural population by genotyping five SNPs using SNPShot technique in APOA1, ABCA1, and LCAT, which are involved in the RCT (690 patients, 743 controls). We conducted unconditional logistical regression analysis to evaluate associations and generalized multifactor dimensionality reduction to evaluate interactions. Results revealed significant differences in rs670 and rs2292318 allele frequencies between cases and controls (P<0.025). rs670 G allele carriers were more likely to develop dyslipidemia than A allele carriers (OR = 1.315, OR 95% CI: 1.067–2.620; P = 0.010). rs2292318 T allele carriers were more likely to develop dyslipidemia than A allele carriers (OR = 1.264, OR 95% CI: 1.037–1.541; P = 0.020).

https://openalex.org/W2802018096,"Active recovery is often used by athletes after strenuous exercise or competition but its underlying mechanisms are not well understood. We hypothesized that active recovery speeds-up recovery processes within the muscle and the central nervous system (CNS).We assessed muscular and CNS recovery by measuring the voluntary activation (VA) in the vastus lateralis muscle with transcranial magnetic stimulation (VATMS) and peripheral nerve stimulation (VAPNS) during maximal voluntary contractions (MVC) of the knee extensors in 11 subjects. Measurements were performed before and after a fatiguing cycling time-trial, after an active and a passive recovery treatment and after another fatiguing task (1 min MVC). The measurements were performed a second time 24 h after the time-trial.We observed a time × group interaction effect for VATMS (p = 0.013). Post-hoc corrected T-tests demonstrated an increased VATMS after active recovery when measured after the 1 min MVC performed 24 h after the time-trial (mean ± SD; 95.2 ± 4.1% vs. 89.2 ± 6.6%, p = 0.026). No significant effects were observed for all other variables.Active recovery increased aspects of central, rather than muscle recovery. However, no effect on MVC was seen, implying that even if active recovery speeds up CNS recovery, without affecting the recovery of muscle contractile properties, this doesn´t translate into increases in overall performance."
https://openalex.org/W2804110710,"Background The natriuretic peptide hormones play an important role in salt and blood pressure regulation. In observational studies, obesity and insulin resistance have been consistently associated with lower concentrations of natriuretic peptides. It has been proposed that insulin influences natriuretic peptide production. Objective We sought to determine the acute effects of insulin administration on natriuretic peptide concentrations. Methods 31 men and women (11 lean, 10 overweight, and 10 obese), ages 30–70 years, without cardiovascular disease or overt diabetes underwent a hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic insulin clamp. Plasma concentrations of N-terminal pro atrial natriuretic peptide (NT-proANP) and N-terminal pro B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) were measured at baseline and steady-state (the final 30 minutes of the clamp protocol). Results From baseline to steady-state, insulin levels increased from a mean level of 9.5 to 176.7 μU/ml (p<0.001). Over this period, circulating NT-proANP concentrations decreased by 9% (-1933 ng/L, p = 0.01). The changes in NT-proANP did not differ between lean, overweight, and obese individuals. Steady-state NT-proANP levels, adjusted for baseline, were lower in individuals with greater insulin resistance, independent of BMI. In contrast to NT-proANP, NT-proBNP levels did not change significantly during the clamp (p = 0.41). Conclusion Insulin administration was associated with a moderate decrease in circulating NT-proANP, but not NT-proBNP. The lowest NT-proANP concentrations were found in insulin-resistant individuals. Further investigations are warranted to elucidate potential mechanisms underlying the effects of insulin on the cardiac hormonal axis."

Frequent outbreaks of ND in commercial chickens vaccinated with live vaccines suggest a need to develop improved vaccines that are genetically matched against circulating Newcastle disease virus (NDV) strains. In this study, the fusion protein cleavage site (FPCS) sequence of NDV strain Banjarmasin/010 (Banj), a genotype VII NDV, was individually modified using primer mutagenesis to those of avian paramyxovirus (APMV) serotypes 2, 7 and 8 and compared with the recombinant Banjarmasin (rBanj) with avirulent NDV LaSota cleavage site (rBanj-LaSota). These FPCS mutations changed the in vitro cell-to-cell fusion activity and made rBanj FPCS mutant viruses highly attenuated in chickens. When chickens immunized with the rBanj FPCS mutant viruses and challenged with the virulent Banj, there was reduced challenge virus shedding observed compared to chickens immunized with the heterologous vaccine strain LaSota. Among the genotype VII NDV Banj vaccine candidates, rBanj-LaSota and rBanj containing FPCS of APMV-8 induced highest neutralizing antibody titers and protected chickens with reduced challenge virus shedding. These results show the effect of the F protein cleavage site sequence in generating genotype VII matched NDV vaccines."
https://openalex.org/W2799379656,"Ankyrin repeat and kinase domain containing 1 (ANKK1) gene has been widely related to neuropsychiatry disorders. The localization of ANKK1 in neural progenitors and its correlation with the cell cycle has suggested its participation in development. However, ANKK1 functions still need to be identified. Here, we have further characterized the ANKK1 localization in vivo and in vitro, by using immunolabeling, quantitative real-time PCR and Western blot in the myogenic lineage. Histologic investigations in mice and humans revealed that ANKK1 is expressed in precursors of embryonic and adult muscles. In mice embryos, ANKK1 was found in migrating myotubes where it shows a polarized cytoplasmic distribution, while proliferative myoblasts and satellite cells show different isoforms in their nuclei and cytoplasm. In vitro studies of ANKK1 protein isoforms along the myogenic progression showed the decline of nuclear ANKK1-kinase until its total exclusion in myotubes. In adult mice, ANKK1 was expressed exclusively in the Fast-Twitch muscles fibers subtype. The induction of glycolytic metabolism in C2C12 cells with high glucose concentration or treatment with berberine caused a significant increase in the ANKK1 mRNA. Similarly, C2C12 cells under hypoxic conditions caused the increase of nuclear ANKK1. These results altogether show a relationship between ANKK1 gene regulation and the metabolism of muscles during development and in adulthood. Finally, we found ANKK1 expression in regenerative fibers of muscles from dystrophic patients. Future studies in ANKK1 biology and the pathological response of muscles will reveal whether this protein is a novel muscle disease biomarker."
https://openalex.org/W2804618468,"To improve the overall welfare levels of sows and to reduce stress levels at late 35-day lactation, we selected targeted behavioral indicators that might be associated with stress. Therefore, we monitored and evaluated the adaptive capability of two different breeds of sows to the farrowing environment. In this study, Damin sows (Large White × Min pig sows, n = 20) and Large White sows (n = 20) were farrowed in individual pens. Saliva was collected and tested for cortisol density at –15 min, and then at +15, 30, 60, 90, 120, 180 and 240 min after an adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) stimulation test conducted at 20, 27 and 34 d post-partum. The postures, including ventral and lateral recumbency to other postures, defecating, urinating, sham-chewing and bar-biting behavior, were observed by video from 07:00 to 09:00 and from 13:00 to 15:00 on the 7th day of each week from the 3rd to the 5th week post-parturition. In addition, the concentrations of salivary interleukin (IL)-6, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α and secretory immunoglobulin (SIgA) were assayed after the observed behaviors. The results showed no significant difference between Damin sows and Large White sows in terms of behaviors at the 3rd week. Additionally, there were no significant differences between Damin and Large White sows in terms of the behaviors of ventral recumbency and bar-biting with the exception of lateral recumbency to other postures, sham-chewing, defecation and urination in the fifth week. Meanwhlie, there was significant difference between two breeds in term of ventral recumbency at the 4th week. The result of the ACTH test showed a significant difference between the Damin and Large White sows by the 27th and 34th days postpartum (P<0.01). In addition, the serological concentrations of IL-6 and TNF-α were not significantly different between the two breeds at the 3rd week postpartum. However, these indicators were significantly different at the 5th week postpartum (P = 0.000, and P = 0.003, respectively). The SIgA concentrations in saliva were significantly different between breeds at the 3rd week postpartum (P<0.01). In conclusion, both breeds of sows maybe in a state of stress after the 4th week postpartum. However, the Damin sows may be better than the Large White sows in terms of adapting to this farrowing environment."
https://openalex.org/W2802319570,"To conserve threatened/endangered species, we need to understand the factors contributing to reproductive success and recruitment to reproductive stage. Obtaining this information is difficult for snakes because they are secretive, are not easy to locate at the same stage each year, and are sometimes sparsely distributed. We determined nest fate, hatchling growth and survival to age 5 years, and recruitment to breeding age of Northern Pine Snakes (Pituophis melanoleucus) in New Jersey Pine Barrens from 1986 to 2017. Pine Snakes are ‘threatened’ in New Jersey and in other states, and are at risk because of increased human population, habitat loss, predation, and poaching. Age of first-breeding was 4-years, based on snout-vent length of gravid and laying females, and snout-vent length of females followed as hatchlings to 5-years. Mean clutch size (+ 1 SE) was 9.5 + 0.3 (N = 53). The annual percent of nests in which eggs hatched averaged 25% (N = 288 nests), and varied among 5-year periods (5% to 30%/year). Of lab-reared hatchlings released into natal nests (N = 90), 26% (2015) and 32% (2016) reached hibernacula excavated in 2016 and 2017. The sex ratio of hatchlings reaching hibernation sites (N = 181) between 1986 and 2015 was skewed toward females (74/106, 59% females), and varied among 5-year periods (47–75% females). Once hatchlings reached a hibernaculum, there was a sex-related difference in survival. For hatchlings reaching a monitored hibernaculum, survival to 3-years was 35% in females and 40% in males, and to 4-years was 25% in females and 33% in males. Using these data, only 10% of females reached 3 years (first possible breeding age), and 7% survived to 4-years. Methodological problems with determining survival rates during these early critical years are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W2804178656,"The recent mountain pine beetle outbreak in western Canada provides an opportunity to study the selection and heritability of tree defenses. We examined terpenoid-based defenses of seedling lodgepole pines which were offspring of mature trees subjected to high levels of mountain pine beetle selective pressure. Seedlings were grown from one of three types of cones: old cones on live trees; young cones on live trees; and cones on trees killed by beetles. Offspring thus represented crosses of non-surviving (NS) x surviving (S), S x S, and NS x NS parents, respectively. Methyl jasmonate was used to induce a defensive reaction in the seedlings. Seed source had a significant effect on levels of ten different terpenes, but not on total terpene concentrations. When the seedlings were grouped by location and treatment type, the seedlings of different cone types could be almost entirely distinguished by terpene profiles."
https://openalex.org/W2803159993,"Individuals often respond differently to the same vaccine; some of this variation may be caused by genetic differences among animals. Our objective was to estimate heritability and identify genomic regions associated with humoral response to an Escherichia coli O157:H7 vaccine in beef cattle. Crossbred beef cattle (n = 651) were vaccinated with a commercially available E. coli O157:H7 vaccine. Serum was collected at time of initial vaccination (d 0), booster (d 21), and d 56 after initial vaccination. Total antibodies specific to siderophore receptor and porin proteins in the vaccine were quantified by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Genomic DNA was isolated from whole blood and genotyped with the bovine GeneSeek Genomic Profiler-High Density 78K or 26K Single Nucleotide Polymorphism BeadChip and imputed to 777,000 SNP genotypes. Heritability was estimated by restricted maximum likelihood (REML) using both 1) pedigree and 2) genomic relationships among individuals. Fixed effects were contemporary group, calf age, sex, principal components from SNP genotype data, and pedigree-derived heterozygosity effects. Additive and dominance effects of SNPs were estimated individually while accounting for contemporary group, sex, and the top 20 principal components calculated from the genomic relationship matrix. Heritability of initial response to vaccination (d 21 -d 0) was 0.10 ± 0.175 using pedigree relationships and 0.14 ± 0.149 using genomic relationships, but neither estimate was statistically different from zero. Heritability of booster (d 56 -d 21) and overall (d 56 -d 0) responses were low and not statistically significant from zero. There were no clusters of linked SNP associated with vaccine response, but eight regionally isolated SNPs were significantly associated with initial or overall response to vaccination. Regional genetic variation for initial response to an E. coli O157:H7 vaccine was observed, although overall heritability of this response was not statistically significant from zero."
https://openalex.org/W2804614654,"Critically ill hospitalized patients are at increased risk of infection so we assessed the immunogenicity of 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (PPSV23) administered within six days of injury.This prospective observational study compared the immunogenicity of PPSV23 among critically ill burn and neurosurgical patients at a tertiary, academic medical center. Patients received PPSV23 vaccination within six days of ICU admission per standard of care. Consent was obtained to measure concentrations of vaccine-specific IgG to 14 of 23 serotype capsule-specific IgG in serum prior to and 14-35 days following PPSV23. A successful immunologic response was defined as both a ≥2-fold rise in capsule-specific IgG from baseline and concentrations of >1 mcg/mL to 10 of 14 measured vaccine serotypes. Immunologic response was compared between burn and neurosurgical patients. Multiple variable regression methods were used to explore associations of clinical and laboratory parameters to immunologic responses.Among the 16 burn and 27 neurosurgical patients enrolled, 87.5% and 40.7% generated a successful response to the vaccine, respectively (p = 0.004). Both median post-PPSV23 IgG concentrations (7.79 [4.56-18.1] versus 2.93 [1.49-8.01] mcg/mL; p = 0.006) and fold rises (10.66 [7.44-14.56] versus 3.48 [1.13-6.59]; p<0.001) were significantly greater in burn compared with neurosurgical patients. Presence of burn injury was directly and days from injury to immunization were inversely correlated with successful immunologic response (both p<0.03). Burn injury was associated with both increased median antibody levels post-PPSV23 and fold rise to 14 vaccine serotypes (p<0.03), whereas absolute lymphocyte count was inversely correlated with median antibody concentrations (p = 0.034).Critically ill burn patients can generate successful responses to PPSV23 during acute injury whereas responses among neurosurgical patients is comparatively blunted. Further study is needed to elucidate the mechanisms of differential antigen responsiveness in these populations, including the role of acute stress responses, as well as the durability of these antibody responses."
